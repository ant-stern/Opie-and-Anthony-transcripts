<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of Charlie Sheen’s infamous hotel incident, dissecting the conflicting narratives surrounding the incident involving escorts, cocaine, and property damage.  The hosts contrasted the publicist's “allergic reaction” explanation with the emerging details from various news sources, commenting on Sheen's wealth and the perceived preferential treatment afforded to celebrities in Los Angeles.  A listener, "Pirate Trucker," called in to share his perspective on the situation.

A substantial portion of the show focused on their intern, Stevie, who became the target of relentless mockery for his various blunders. This included his failure to obtain the correct Excedrin, and a lengthy, bizarre conversation about his unusual pornography preferences involving Cheryl Tiegs magazine covers and anime. The hosts dissected the contents of Stevie's iPod, leading to much laughter and disbelief.  The discussion also briefly touched upon the perceived mistreatment of interns and a ban on making them do push-ups.  Another listener called in, surprisingly unaware of who Cheryl Tiegs was.

A psychologist specializing in hoarding disorders then joined the show as a guest.  The conversation centered on the A&E show "Hoarders," focusing on the challenges of treating hoarders, the psychological aspects of the disorder, and the crew’s reactions to the extreme conditions encountered (including descriptions of feces and animal remains). The psychologist discussed the treatment process, the difficulties involved, and the frustrating lack of progress maintained by many patients post-filming. The conversation also briefly mentioned Scott Weiland's birthday and the upcoming appearances of Tom Green and Huey Lewis.  A brief discussion of a scene from an Ozzy Osbourne interview was also included.

Comedian Tom Green was the next guest.  He detailed his own experiences filming "Hoarders," describing overwhelming smells and insect infestations. He promoted his comedy and podcast, sharing anecdotes from his experiences on the show and discussing the show's popularity and societal fascination with such content.  He also discussed the ease of avoiding contact through technology versus the unavoidable nature of landlines and promoted his upcoming stand-up shows at the Comedy Cellar.  The conversation transitioned to Green's stand-up act, his past material (including his divorce), his current focus on more positive content, his rigorous filming schedule for web videos, and his recent break from touring due to fatigue.  The discussion then shifted to the New York Yankees and the World Series.  The hosts also engaged in another extended, humorous, and highly personal discussion with Stevie, focusing on his strained relationship with his father and graphic, offensive details about his mother's dating life, with the hosts repeatedly pressing him for details.

Huey Lewis then joined the show.  The conversation initially revolved around his new soul music tribute album, the recording process in Memphis, and the 25th anniversary of *Back to the Future*.  They also discussed the movie's enduring popularity, potential controversies in today's context, Lewis' experience with the *American Psycho* soundtrack, and the controversy surrounding his decision to not include his music in the film.  The conversation then shifted to baseball, specifically the San Francisco Giants' World Series run and the alleged spitting incident involving Cliff Lee's wife by Yankee fans. They further discussed Huey Lewis and the News’ career, including anecdotes about performing the national anthem at Giants games, the challenges of a cappella singing, the creation of music videos (specifically the "Do You Believe in Love?" video, which Lewis himself deemed "cringeworthy"), the band's success with *Sports*, and the changing music industry landscape due to the internet and digital music distribution. The financial impact of digital music sales on artists was also discussed.  Stevie was brought back in, sparking a humorous exchange about Stevie’s fandom of Huey Lewis and the News and another off-color joke involving Cheryl Tiegs.  Stevie's extensive knowledge of the band's discography was also tested.  The show concluded with the hosts playing a radio segment from iPower 92.1 in Richmond, Virginia, about a "fugitive" who stole $5,000 – ultimately revealed to be a bit featuring Chip Chipperson, similar to other “fugitive” bits on other stations.

[00:21:00]  pictures of her yeah but it's just weird that it's cheryl teagues yeah my pocket of course yeah let's  go ahead and that's why you almost didn't come back in well it wasn't just that because we left  i had to leave we left on a on a cliffhanger so what's the cliffhanger i wish because we well  because i had to leave we were like in the middle of it and i had to go so i was he told me to come  back tomorrow because you know but i felt very you know sam is it true you can't do the push-up thing  anymore with the interns yeah we're not allowed to make him do push-ups why can't we make them do 
[00:21:30]  push-ups well why don't you explain what you were doing with a few of these guys well if they  fucked up not a few it was the other ones i would have done it with if they fucked up like that  but stevie they're all told the one thing about the internship regardless of anything else  is to always have a pen and pad on you and don't look for a scrap of paper don't ask me for a pen just  always have your pen and pad on you that's it because you always got to write something down  and steve in the interview they're told that and then it's reiterated over and over again stevie 
[00:22:00]  never had his pen or pad with him at all so i said to stevie anytime you don't have a pen and pad on  you five push-ups that way he learns that's good he does learn but there is an executive order  that they couldn't do push-ups and what is the reasoning behind that did they give you the reason  or did they just say no was there a reason well they i heard they said if you have a problem with 
[00:22:30]  it you can take it up with human resources that's that's what radios become what was the issue five  lousy push-ups are you kidding me that's no worse yeah oh uh because we'll never get interns again if  we mistreat them we've been mistreating who told you that who can't do it that oh and we'll get  shitty interns like this i don't understand i mean i don't understand like mistreating and having an  intern do five push-ups to break balls is not mistreating an intern okay yeah if you made him 
[00:23:00]  do a hundred then there could be an issue after a while but five lousy push-ups we're not punching  him in the face i know who did it a guy that whatever the same guy that just fucking gets in  my way constantly we have to uh be able to break balls a little bit of course five lousy push-ups  gives a shit i also want to know why another guy had to come in with the excedrin well did you hear 
[00:23:30]  what he came back with when he said oh my god what he said he came back with excedrin yes he did  he didn't say what letters were after excedrin p.m you said come out that would have been great  he said come out what you thought was the right one they had why would i need excedrin p.m so i could  doze off during the show you you had to choose between a.m and p.m and you went p.m and i said i  said three times that's the standard issue regular excedrin what were you told to purchase excedrin and 
[00:24:00]  then you you asked and elaborated what kind of excedrin what kind of excedrin were you told  he said plain old excedrin right right and then he and then 20 minutes he and then i made sure he  knew where the store was and made sure it was 24 hours uh-huh all right and when he was gone for 20  minutes i started to get worried because the guy who went out for jim's coffee starbucks is basically in  the same location he was back in like 10 minutes yeah you know with the coffee right and then sam 
[00:24:30]  told me stevie called and didn't know what type of excedrin to buy so sam told him to use your best  judgment oh wow he had to choose between a.m and p.m and came back with p.m p.m we're on in the a.m  do you know what that means it's like a sleeping pill maybe stevie was confused because it was still  dark outside yeah that's true you know it's dark you're only allowed to buy p.m in the dark

[00:42:30]  in for a little while before we bring tom green in here so yes i would like to we're gonna take a  break and we're gonna get the hoarder uh psychologist psychiatrist which one is she i don't think a  psychologist psychologist can't prescribe medication right i think so yeah no  psychologist prescribes medication no psychiatrist psychiatrist pills psychologist coddles hoarders  all right so we got the the coddling hoard hoarder lady next  the opian anthony show on the virus sirius xm

[00:44:00]  charlie shane birthday today yeah charlie shane i mean there's a big problem there uh we i think we  have the appropriate person to talk to that about i think she just went to the bathroom a psychologist  oh wow is she going to the bathroom she's haggard we're talking to her what i thought that i thought  that was someone's mother but she's she's got well she's probably someone's mother what what danny  there's no age limit on being a doctor i guess yeah would you expect a hot doctor with big tits  she talks to psychos i guess she i guess what i'm saying if they're not good looking there's no real 
[00:44:30]  reason to talk to them on our radio show until today until today but you actually got a woman with a  brain yeah yeah she's going in there dropping a deuce i'm just not just not a fan of the uh the  coddling people so yeah well that's what i want to find out is she on the show a lot yeah you  recognize her uh yeah she's uh one of them that goes in there and uh yeah and uh talks to these  fucking lunatics about their hoarding well my goal is to break her down what's really yes they all 
[00:45:00]  have an issue do i've uh i've seen her she's gotten frustrated with some of them like she's not  as i hope so coddling as some of the others which are the initial walk-in that i have a problem with  the initial hi what do you tell me about this we gotta gain their trust oh no you know what reason  you gotta smack them in the face should be walk-in smack a backhand whap so you're more about shock  therapy yes tough love and shock jockery how's your ass cheeks yeah oh they're better they've 
[00:45:30]  settled in i really want to rub a fucking a salt and vinegar potato chip between his tender ass  cheeks oh if you have a problem i do the water i have to do the wet toilet paper thing  if you're saying you have a problem with cheese why are you eating more cheese it's just one slice  is fine but i had a whole sandwich but if you have like liquid diarrhea pouring out of your ass why  are you eating more cheese if that's what's caused it to begin with it's just one slice with  the turkey get rid of the fucking cheese i had a whole sandwich though of just cheese 
[00:46:00]  ah there she is i recognize you the coddler the coddler did you hear us talking about you  you said the psychologists are the coddlers what's up with that well i now now we can actually man  actually good now we can get off on the wrong now we can get into this i love watching the show  we're all fans of hoarders but i i i don't understand the kid glove uh thing with these 
[00:46:30]  hoarders well what why not tough love let's get right into this a little more toughness we are on  the air by the way oh hi good to know yeah yeah you know um i think one of the problems is is you're  only seeing part of the whole situation we've got 70 hours of footage into 22 minutes on air well  unless some of that 70 hours is backhanding some of these people in the face i get so frustrated  watching the show i've watched every episode i love the show i don't know why it it it angers me 
[00:47:00]  but i cannot stop watching it and it's that initial knock on the door and it's like hi hello  why don't you tell me about this room and meanwhile i'm thinking tell her but it's a mess it's full of  garbage what do you think when you walk in because we we yell at the television oh my god yeah what do  you think when you walk in watch an episode with you guys see what what really happens in people's  homes he loves the show i hate it because i got i got one of those people in my life not a hoarder 
[00:47:30]  though yeah but the me me me thing it is we're not fans of the me me me when i watch it it's like  these are to me they look like very selfish people that will not they'll write off their family friends  in order to uh have this garbage in their house by the way you do realize that we're all just unloading  on her yes like a doctor yes well i know you guys have been waiting for me for what like three seasons  now you know we got a lot to say robin dr robin i'm sorry you know i i think um to the viewer it 
[00:48:00]  doesn't make any sense and and logically hoarding does not make sense whatsoever and when you're a  loved one it's it's even worse because it's just maddening to think how could you you know have this  much stuff and you're putting garbage before your loved one right that's that is the thought but i mean  you know so much of what we're trying to do is to promote awareness and help people to understand  that this is in fact driven by anxiety it's driven chemically is it really it really is and you know 
[00:48:30]  this is we again we only have so much that we can put out on the tv and um you know promote that  awareness and help people to understand do you think these people should have the right to live  right to live i do i do they are human sometimes i'm kind of joking but sometimes uh you think if  that one person is out of the picture then the rest of the family unit could could function so much 
[00:49:00]  better yeah that's what it looks like i mean i know that's the entire family it's it's upsetting  the entire family right but but mental illness upsets a whole entire family too if you've got someone  in the family who's got schizophrenia it's going to throw everything off and i think it's important  to remember that compulsive hoarding is seen as a form of mental illness and how come a lot of times  uh when you see the the woman as the hoarder the husband will be so enabling it's it's like i i again  i get angered and and it's like he's a little worm just do something throw the second she brings it in 
[00:49:30]  throw it out you know it's i it's frustrating and i experienced the same frustration i mean you said you  know what happens when you walk in in in a hoarder's house you know it is overwhelming i mean that's the  reality i'm not going to say i walk in and i'm oh this isn't that bad piece of cake you know where  do we start where's the organizer let's go it's really overwhelming there's a piece of cake it's  behind the desk there's actually there's lots of cake somewhere but a cat skull it's you know it is 
[00:50:00]  overwhelming but you know i i have to keep going back to just saying that this is a form of mental  illness and you know people don't you know in college or even high school say you know when i grow up  i want to become a compulsive hoarder i want to live in filth i want cps to come and take my children  away i want my husband to leave me and divorce me that's not a conscious decision that they make  but where did the treatment how does it dictate the treatment that that you should be very um 
[00:50:30]  hey okay uh this is good we we need now don't take anything out unless she says it's okay like why  that instead of the hey instead of some tough tough love as they say well i think we're trying to show  a balance of tough love i mean you see in the show you've got the doctor and you've got the organizer  and the doctor is there to manage the anxiety that comes up when they have to go through  this incredible process love when it goes to attend love a couple times yeah yeah um you know 
[00:51:00]  it's it's a tough process for them to go through and we have to sort of maintain that balance between  them freaking out and saying everybody get out of here right versus trying to keep that balance and  i think that you'll see that different doctors have different approaches yeah yeah i i have seen  that but initially it's always dealt with this very hey that's let's be not it's very soft spoken okay  tell me about this how do you really think that's necessary you know i think it's important to remember 
[00:51:30]  that these people have been met with anger with judgment with shame with badgering with nagging and if  we go in and we do the same thing oh ah you know that is true it makes sense we're acting like nobody  in their family has ever said throw it out exactly thank you thank you that makes okay now i've never  thought of it that way that makes sense and i want to align with them i want them to know that i'm there  to help them that i get it and if we can try to meet at least in some level but at the same time 
[00:52:00]  push them to sort of say look you know we're in crisis here i mean you know the show hoarders is about  a crisis and i think it's that balance between not having the client just get really angry with  you because you're pushing them too hard which is what everybody else has done and and trying to  you know help them to see that they've got an opportunity here is there usually some type of  trauma that that brings this up because you you just see them going my dog died and that's when they 
[00:52:30]  started going to kmart and buying everything i i have to say that it just varies you see people  that have trauma you see people where they'll just say i don't know why i i can't explain it all i know  is that when i go out i see a good deal i can't pass it up and then they just start acquiring and  quiet and you talked about the husband that makes you crazy because he's you know coddling her and 
[00:53:00]  saying okay honey sleeping you know a piece of the bed it's surrounded by garbage you would think  this guy would go hey i want a real life here well i think you know we have to remember that the  hoarding problem didn't happen overnight it's a gradual process that's happened very odd it would  happen there's 300 rakes here and i think that what happens is is that people forget that this is a  gradual process and like any one of us if we don't know what to do we just kind of keep trying and  thinking it's going to go away and you know ironically they get to this place where like oh 
[00:53:30]  my gosh what what's happened here there's just been this you know garbage but the person you live  with had 500 opportunities to just make sure it didn't get worse does it start with a dish in the  sink one dish one dish and then it's two then it's three and you know what i mean you know typically  it it starts back um further than that it's not just you know they got married all of a sudden the  person became a hoarder where did that come from usually there's a progression that you can see  in childhood and you know we can't get through all that in the show i mean what a lot of people 
[00:54:00]  don't realize is there is a huge huge production that happens before we even get to that house of  of um interviewing them making sure they're appropriate for the show we're talking with  them to make sure that you know psychologically they're prepared and you do see people melt down  and you know sometimes it's because they are being pushed too hard it's too much too fast  it's a catch-22 because while that's not my goal at the same time we've got a crisis if we don't get 
[00:54:30]  this place cleaned up by the time we leave i don't know if you guys saw the hawaii episode  oh yeah you know that those children were going to be taken away period that was a bad situation  and the irony is i got a lot of flack for calling um cps you know as some of the blogs were saying how  could you do that and other ones were saying you know i can't believe no one called them sooner  yeah and the reality was is when i walked in these children had no place to sleep they did not have  access to food i mean you saw the show disaster and you know what i was able to do was to avert that 
[00:55:00]  and in just a couple days this family was um intact when we left and they still are can i ask you a  question too um one thing that bothers me about we've all dealt with uh you know someone whatever i've  never had a hoarder but you know i've dealt with enough people i wanted to smash what is it about  and i asked my therapist about this too when it comes to mental illness the thing that bothers me  is you don't hear the self-centeredness of it addressed enough like there there is there is a sickness 
[00:55:30]  to it that's chemical and the people can't help and i understand that like you know but then there is  also a selfishness that is conscious and is uh uncaring about the other people and is very very  self-centered and that's something i wish was that's to me the part that should be addressed a little  more harshly um as opposed to the chemical stuff but the self-centeredness isn't uh destroys everyone  around the yeah and there really is a self-centeredness that can be helped and it's not helped how come  that's not addressed as much well again i i think we can't sort of throw the baby out with the bathtub 
[00:56:00]  because again you're only seeing a small portion of the interactions that we're having in those three  days that were there i know but jimmy's talking in general i'm generalizing not just you're the show  there's a lot of people out there that have someone in their family with a mental illness or or they're  hoarding and i think jimmy's question is very valid it's it's it's a me me me self-centeredness that  ruins everybody else the self-obsession part of it what are we supposed to do as quote i'll say quote 
[00:56:30]  the normal people in that situation we're supposed to just go through life dealing with that crap  well i think the first thing is that um you know hoarders just blew compulsive hoarding the the  problem out of the water um you know we all kind of talk about oh the person down the street right  you know someone or whatever but it's been blown out of the water and i think that um we have to  remember that it's it's it's chemically driven and then yes i mean i think that there does come a 
[00:57:00]  point where you say why are you allowing your family to live in this why are you allowing your  children to not have have access to food and i think that they don't really know how to how to  get out of it and we want to make the assumption if it was me if it was you you would do it but none  of us can really understand if we were in any situation what we would truly do we always want  to speculate oh if that was me yeah you know i would do that that's the easy way to look at it of  course not some of them are unbearable to watch where it's it's like this woman i don't know 
[00:57:30]  what's causing it as far as chemical imbalance goes or what have you but sometimes you watch and  go she is not listening to anybody she's completely self-centered um she she's speaking logically when  she's talking it's not like she's a stark raving lunatic aside from hoarding everything but she's  not listening to her family loved ones um a psychologist anything they just shut down and go no this is my  stuff i'm a collector i'm not a hoarder i love that line and everything is so valuable when 
[00:58:00]  you're picking through trash and watching these people picking through trash and and they're going  oh no that's that's good and it's covered with rat feces or roach eggs roach eggs or whatever and  they're they're looking at it like no i need this and now you have to step in and talk them down and  say why they don't need this it that is beyond me it's exhausting to watch yeah episodes where i think  what was it monday night there was the woman that had uh you know lots of uh home shopping network 
[00:58:30]  stuff and there was the rat or mouse urine on it yeah yeah you know wanting to hold on to things and  there's no logical explanation i mean i can you know sit here and explain what we know about it  but you know at the end of the day that's the reality of this condition it doesn't make sense it is  maddening i understand the darth tater now that to me was a very valuable piece and it shouldn't have  been thrown in the truck only because the roaches wouldn't go near it that really was an awful treat  she was so upset at the darth tater that cracked me up uh do people ever get upset that the trucks 
[00:59:00]  that come by i've always thought of this that say got junk on them like i would think the people would  be upset that the trucks say junk say junk and it's like these are prized possessions to the people  i would think you would cover that up you know that's never come up before has it never you know  as i watch that i'm like oh that would be upset they should change the name to got cat shit  got disgusting stuff got cat carcasses they're so anxious when we get there because you know let's 
[00:59:30]  face it sort of like intervention i don't know how you know people are thinking they're in a  documentary when intervention's been there like nine you know seasons now and how could they not know  like this is intervention yeah we're doing a documentary on addiction yeah yeah so you know  i think with hoarders it's the same thing they they've seen it enough they know what's to come  and you know like uh what was the other one that was like that um the chris hansen show like a lot  of times the pedos yeah after a while they would watch it and we would know they would know 
[01:00:00]  i could not figure out that one yeah yeah sometimes the cookies were so good  they used the same they used the same set too the same exact set you would think they would change  it up a little bit uh that's why don't you take a seat over there i don't think the hoarders could  be cured though it's i really don't it's a very long-term process i mean really long-term i mean  what we're doing in in three days typically takes a year and a half believe it or not if we can do it  right um because the brain chemistry is so powerful as you're seeing why are they digging through this 
[01:00:30]  stuff because there's like this switch that goes on and they don't know how to switch it off and so  again that's why the doctor comes out is to help them to say look you know you're holding on to  this you've got a cognitive distortion about sorting through what is clearly mixed in with feces or  other contaminants and it's gotta go i gotta ask you this also these are things i've wondered that  would never make the show uh the guys that do the cleaning are just knock around regular guys 
[01:01:00]  uh they're not psychiatrists they're not trained in this has any of them ever just bust out laughing  at some of the insane things these people do and upset the people really um you know i think that  they try to be aware um but you know look the reality is is when you walk in the situation is as  it is and sometimes you know we all sort of say oh my gosh i i don't even get why they're holding on  to this it is it is frustrating and the doctors and everything they have to kind of look and you're 
[01:01:30]  professional you you know how to go about it but i think the guy wielding the snow shovel uh shoveling  up uh cat skeletons and stuff is going to go like holy jeez this woman's insane you know again i think  you know we're we're far into season three now we're not surprised about anything anymore i mean  look at the things that have been coming up this is the real world these are just the people that  you're seeing on hoarders they are out there yeah like three million i can think it's huge and a lot 
[01:02:00]  of them i'm sorry to interrupt you a lot of them have been left it's like we forget that's a good  point is that you'd only seen we're like why don't people leave the majority of them or a lot of them  probably do get dumped by their spouses right or left yeah yeah yeah i mean that's good then  you're you're seeing the ones seriously that you know have been casted for the show and again we're  looking at crises and things like that but you're absolutely right there are so many people out there  suffering and i have no idea what that budget looks like in terms of what it costs to bring all  of us out there it's got to be insane yeah and if you figure that people are truly in crisis whether 
[01:02:30]  it be adult protective services cps and you're typically talking about a year and a half process  there's no way that cps is going to sit on that for a year and a half and say okay well we'll be  patient yeah yeah they're going to take you know kids away and uh and so that's why you see so much  overwhelm is because you see the level of horde you see how it's saying insane it's gotten and  suddenly they're expected to pack up you know 30 years potentially more of accumulation i mean we're  seeing typically people in their late 40s 50s who are finally reaching out for help we're not seeing 
[01:03:00]  the younger people you know what it is uh also it's when you watch the show i don't know if you've  noticed you've noticed in this room but i think it's everyone i've talked to they're infuriated  like it's infuriating to watch i can't stop watching it but i get so mad i i've had a a friend  say i want to see them walk in with one suitcase throw it at the person so you got 10 minutes to pack 
[01:03:30]  this one suitcase and then we're burning the house down yeah this is how angry people get and and i sit  there and watch and do the same thing they should have bulldozers outside the house and make them  grab some stuff and then just plow it into the basement it's infuriating people get mad watching  this show by people he means he and i don't mean yeah you mentioned you have a family member oh yeah  we all do and it's not a hoarder though it's a it's an ocd thing but it's all encompassing and 
[01:04:00]  we're all affected by it right and we have to make believe she's normal it's ridiculous yeah yeah  you know yeah how should you deal with that that's that's why uh yeah it's that's what jimmy  got at earlier it's a me me thing that i can't get past well i don't want to help this person anymore  i really don't that's that's that's uh that's how i feel about it after many many years enough  already yeah when it starts affecting everybody else in your family unit but you know what what  what is her value you know the bottom line is is you know they all cliche you know you can't uh 
[01:04:30]  lead a horse to water and make them drink you know this is the same thing and ocd is the same  thing right you know probably you know 80 plus percent of the population that i treat has ocd  it's the most common anxiety disorder most people could keep it under control you know i i have a  whole so you wash your hands that are you know they've got bloody hands washing their hands and  you know they won't leave the house and and that sort of thing um but i think you have to find that  balance which is what we're trying to do of sort of saying i'm i'm not gonna you know support you 
[01:05:00]  in this behavior anymore um and and do tough love and at the same time letting them know i'm here for  you if you're ready to get help yeah i changed the way uh how i interact with this person and it's  helped a lot you have to it's finally helped a lot yeah yeah no more nonsense you know i just don't  think the hoarders especially could be cured i really don't yeah i i think a very small percentage  of them sure but in general they're lost causes is there a lot of residual anger at them like 
[01:05:30]  because that's what it's like like after it's all done like the people are just going like you  motherfucker like i know you got the stuff out of the house now but there's gotta be like a lot  of residual anger at all those years of me me me right and the show i want to see is uh the  hoarders a year later yeah they've done some updates they have on them yeah because you're moving on to  the next uh whack job and then they throw everything out yeah i want to i want to see what's happening to  the people from like the first season and i would bet a lot of money most of them went right back to 
[01:06:00]  doing that yeah i mean it'd be interesting to see at the end of season three how season one is doing  you know people oh wow you don't keep in touch with them that's smart yeah you know the reality is  and this is what a lot of people don't know is that um the hoarders show if you will the production  company a any network um they provide an extremely significant aftercare package and so when you see  at the very end you know so and so is working with an organizer a therapist yeah those funds have been  provided by the network precisely because of what you're talking about none of us think that we're 
[01:06:30]  going to go and clean it up boom be done because you do see kind of the happy endings oh my gosh look  at how how nice it is that kind of thing um but the reality is is if they don't continue with very  very consistent follow-up you're right they're going to go back to those old behaviors because  you know what brought them there it was the dumpster diving it was the yard sales it was the garage  sales it was the buy one get one free it was the it was a good deal the shopping networks so yeah  you've got to keep on them with that because the other thing is is the loved ones don't have those 
[01:07:00]  strategies to help them to refrain from those behaviors there's no fairy tale endings there really isn't  there isn't but you know at the end of the day it's all about motivation you know you guys talk  about the self-centeredness you know are you motivated to do this you now have an opportunity  these people have the most amazing opportunity that that those other people that we don't see  don't have otherwise and i think that that's probably even more what makes you guys so crazy  is because we're in there going okay this piece of paper like you don't remember what it's from but 
[01:07:30]  you want to hold on to it it's maddening for us too i mean i'm not going to lie and say oh i'm  totally fine with it you want to keep that piece of paper so be it but you know i gotta pick my  battles at the same time you know do i want to spend you know 20 minutes on a you know piece  of paper do i need to say okay you know what let's move on and see if we can't get to something  when was hoarding diagnosed because it used to be you're just messy yeah you just think that old  no i'm serious you're a little messy and you wow that you're really messy and then all of a sudden 
[01:08:00]  how did it how did it come about that it's uh it's actually diagnosed as hoarding well it kind of goes  back to what you talked about you know when you're starting to have interference in your  relationships social life but i mean as far as your uh your expertise like when was it diagnosed as  a whole in the books like when did hoarding come about well the irony is is it doesn't have like a  formal diagnosis in terms of clinically in a book but we're we're heading in that direction  because of the awareness now it still isn't even yeah yeah but you know basically what we're 
[01:08:30]  looking at at this point is when you know you're starting to trip over things you can't use areas  for the purpose in which they're intended and again relationships and other aspects of your life you  know you're late for work because you can't find your other shoe or your kids are late for school  because you know they can't find their homework and and so forth so it's really when you're starting  to have that that interference because you know if you're a clutterer if you're a disorganized person  you know that's that's maybe more of a personality trait if you're totally fine with it you know 
[01:09:00]  we're not here to judge you and that sort of yeah we're bringing in tom green as well to hang with  us because we don't have to have him waiting yeah he's yes he's he's a hoarder yeah tom green's a  hoarder yeah are you a hoarder so we're trying to get your help uh how you guys doing good pretty  good good you know the show hoarders you watch hoarders yeah i've seen the i've seen it i've seen it i've  seen it uh briefly yeah i've seen the people the pile the stuff's piled up in their house it's crazy  it's crazy yeah it's fantastic my favorite one was angering my favorite one was where they couldn't 
[01:09:30]  go upstairs because uh the feces oh the bags of oh yeah bags of feces why would you keep that  why would they want to keep the feces what do they want to do with that um you know i i wasn't on  that show you thank god right do you guys get to pick the shows you're on we got a shit bag  thrower i'm actually i'm headed to a house right after this are you in new york can we go with you  um you'd have to talk to the powers i'm thinking you're scared of us right yeah you're scared of 
[01:10:00]  us i'd walk right in what are you doing yeah we would have bullhorns right no you're worried if  it was nazi memorabilia you'd go where did you get that i don't know so they keep bags of feet why do  they keep bags of feces though why would they keep that what's that what are they going to do with  that well i don't know that they're going to do anything with that typically what happens is  is that as the house starts to get hoarded um things start to break down exactly and so  because in hoarding you have such difficulty processing and with organization slash disorganization 
[01:10:30]  that they come up with sort of their own strategy of oh okay i have to go i mean there was that one  that they're just crazy people then right they're just insane people yes you're just making fun of  crazy yeah no he's he's like when he's accurate though it's like when you don't have the cleaning  crew come by in in the sims yeah everything gets messy and they pee on the floor are you are you mad  at people like us that just can't like have an open mind about this absolutely not because you know  my goal is to continue to promote awareness and you know as much as you guys will probably say no i'm 
[01:11:00]  gonna bet that i've like opened your mind up just a little bit by the time that i've left  actually the whole thing with the coddling thing i now have a better understanding because  uh because they have because they have the only other thing they've had is their family yelling  constantly everybody's done that so i'm not saying it's good i think i think a good punch in the face  but but i'm saying it's a different approach to get results it's almost like i'm looking at it from a  vengeful point of view like why don't you go in there and and and deal with the anger i'm feeling 
[01:11:30]  watching them yeah because i'm putting myself in the situation as i'm watching that i'm like  how does the husband sit here and do this and not just like like get a domestic abuse uh charge put  on him because i would have to just smack someone in the head well you know going in and having people  scream at one another and just vent their anger you know i mean i'm not saying that that's not helpful  but i think that there's a place and time for it yeah you know and just screaming and yelling  everything totally detracts from what we're trying to do in that moment we're talking about 
[01:12:00]  the hoarder show right in the big picture they're coming in for therapy i'm going to their house you  know we're we've got a little bit more time kind of thing throw a bag of shit at them  you know i mean they're facing plenty of it around keep keep stop keeping it around if you just every  time you you should train them like you do throw a bag of shit in their face every time you come over  doing that and it's only going to make things work i mean that's the reality keeping these around 
[01:12:30]  keeping keeping these handy how bad do they smell the house of the jokes so keep them oh wow they  would the house is smell right have you ever puked um no you know the the irony is what a lot of  people don't know and so now it's like in super public uh media here um i don't have any smelling  senses i had wow wow perfect perfect for the gig that is and you know that wasn't why they hired  me but wade through shit but along those lines so when you talk about the smell i'm saying it's bad 
[01:13:00]  you're saying well why is it bad if you can't smell it's it's the fumes is it a texture as well  when you walk into a room like you don't like probably a weight oh you can take you can taste it  in your throat can you taste food oh yeah yeah everybody asked me that yeah yeah no i can taste just  fine but it's um it's the fumes and and then what happens is is when you start to stir it up  it's magnified so much worse because everything is kind of subtle so you walk in you've got one  and so we pretty much know once we stir it up it's going to be worse what what is what there's got to 
[01:13:30]  be something that gets to you like there was the the guy who had the couple who saved their shit  i've seen a few people who do that to me the the smell would be bad but the insects would be the  part for me that i couldn't deal with i've seen roach infesting that was beyond like how bad are  the how bad are the bugs that what is your thing like there's got to be one thing that you go like  this is the one i can't deal with well you know there was um a commercial where you heard me say  you know this is probably the worst house i've ever been in yeah and when you saw the house actually  the house wasn't so bad what what happened was i did the the walkthrough and this was not on camera 
[01:14:00]  and i walked downstairs to the basement and they had a dog in there and there was um the toilet  was leaking through the bottom floor into the basement so between the winters between the dog  that lived in there between the mold it just was this perfect storm and i have never been so  overwhelmed in my life and the irony was is that when i walked in i was like oh my gosh do you smell  this they're like what oh yeah oh my gosh you know and so what happens is people get used to it as it 
[01:14:30]  builds up and they don't notice it so working in a dump or a slaughterhouse i mean you don't vomit  every day you get used to it or this studio and along those lines i mean you know i don't think that  people would typically look at me and and you know think that you know they would envision me in a  hoarder house but you know it's kind of like a surgeon you know when they open someone up and  they're looking at things that's just their job that's just what they do so when i go in i'm there  to do a job and so that's why we're not so overwhelmed because we we expect this is what 
[01:15:00]  we're going to see this is the reality of it and you don't get mad at them because you expect them  to be like resistant like when you say why why are you holding that whereas i've never had to  actually listen to it i would want to just go throw it the fuck out you're like you expect them to  go well it's important to me you know and the reality is why am i going to say that because if they  could do it they would do it so telling them something that i already know that they can't do  is is sort of pointless and of course again going back to everybody else has been telling them that 
[01:15:30]  too so i could align with them in a place where you know they feel like someone is on their side  do they see the house differently than other people like do they actually see it differently than other  people walking in yeah they don't see a problem with walking through a little one foot pathway to a  couch that's covered in crap well it depends um do you remember i again i wasn't on this one but do  you remember the one um that had the lady that all the cats yeah and you know you saw the cat's eyes 
[01:16:00]  were all you know yeah crusty and crusty and kind of glued shut by the infection and she expected a  sarah mclaughlin song to start playing donate some money i really want to be clear that you know that  i never see the show before it's aired never really yeah so everything we're talking about is all  stuff that the rest of you have seen but i'm watching this going these cats are healthy and  the one that the one cat that the tabby or whatever it was couldn't even open up its eyes  and it's denial and i think any one of us as long as we continue to deny a problem we don't have to do 
[01:16:30]  anything about it and so denial is kind of this defense much probably like your family member that  if you just keep denying denying denying then you don't have to do anything about it and then the  more that people come in and you're saying you know throw the bag at them you know do this you  know it's very logical on time it's not going to go anywhere you know and that's you know as long as  we can meet them in a place where you know i i do get it i do understand tom you got a question  it's kind of an odd problem that's maybe unique to this country right people that just have too much 
[01:17:00]  stuff yeah it's like you know you look at you know you know the problems in the world there's people  that are starving they don't have anything they don't have shoes and here the biggest problem is  there's people on the shows there's people that's got too much stuff so much stuff that they can't  even get rid of their you know the bag of shit are you saying they don't have hoarders in somalia  they probably don't they don't have anything to hoard probably they do have a show somalia and uh  hoarding oh they do but it's just like one horn is in the house look at this mess  what are you doing there's a stick in the house they they they hoard hands that they've chopped off 
[01:17:30]  in political disputes severed fingers drawer full of clips somewhere you guys just can't resist can  you we gotta make it fun you're trying to contain it as much as possible we're bumming everyone out  we gotta make it kind of fun where is this uh crap hole you have to go to locally now we want to go  with you like what's trouble is it jersey new york i i can't say wow you're scared of us wow tom green 
[01:18:00]  you want to go to a hoarder's house today yeah what shithole are you hanging out  would you get in trouble if we came with you with megaphones and while you went inside we just  booed loudly through the megaphone well needless to say why i'm not telling you where i'm going  because i don't doubt we'll find you it's almost like the mentality of like when you see homeless  people with the shopping cart and they got everything in it right and they just keep their  shopping cart it's there's sort of it's a schizophrenic kind of thing going on right they're  just crazy people that have houses i haven't seen as many of them i've seen a lot of them in the 
[01:18:30]  village i will take a picture of a homeless guy in my neighborhood who is truly a hoarder the amount  of stuff he has in one shopping cart is it the guy with the dreadlocks you've seen him yeah i know who  he is he can't even push this thing he will move it a foot an hour but that's his house i can't believe  i've never filmed this guy that's not hoarding that's his house it's like if everything that  you legitimately needed everything that he finds on the street but he has just he doesn't have a house  to put it in yeah i i'll get video this guy soon i you know it's like i in a weird way i understand  hoarders but i'm much smaller like i collect things like but i i'm not very i'm kind of neat but i do 
[01:19:00]  understand how that could have gotten out of hand yeah like i would collect baseball cards and i would  just go like i have to have it and there would be no logic behind and if somebody was to throw them  away you'd lose your mind i would just nervously tick hold on jimmy let's go with that because this is a  we'll get back to the real shit like uh you're not a hoarder wait how can i explain this  it's not just being messy you know what i mean and smelly and dirty can't you be a hoarder and be  very neat like jimmy's talking about where all of a sudden your house is filled with really like 
[01:19:30]  you neatly stack up your bags of shit how many times i can say bags of shit like like it's  you know you guys remember beer can hoarder oh yeah yeah yeah no i don't know beer can hoarder  i think there was more than that beer cans and you know he was the collector and  you know he those were not beer cans i mean one is you know on the show he says you know i  definitely didn't drink these i'm not even a drinker that he he bought them on ebay or wherever 
[01:20:00]  he got them um you know as we're walking through the house stepping on them smashing them and these  are prize beer cans yes and the reality is something kicks into where you might say you know what i've got  this collection there's a system to it and i'm going to stop here or you know seeing a tattered  uh baseball card that is it worth anything that you don't buy it anyway just because it's a  baseball card and it can go with a collection there's more of a system um in this case you  know we people are talking about being collectors um when it's really hoarding is there's just kind 
[01:20:30]  of um this sort of explosion of purchasing whatever fits you know whether it be barbie dolls or crafts  or whatever and there's not as much of a system and so what happens is it just infiltrates the  whole area is it common how many of them are there well we think how many of these hoarders are  there millions three million they say three million three that's good for a few more seasons  yeah yeah you are loaded up with enough hoarders that's three million really no oh absolutely three 
[01:21:00]  million of these yeah no you don't have that in canada tom i don't i don't know if there's three  million that's one in uh yeah that's one in 100 people it's it is incredible and um where where  they went from it wasn't 350 million one in 35 one in 350 in the very beginning when hoarders started  they were going everywhere trying to find people and now it's it's thousands and thousands that are  coming in and they're just trying to ferret through and really how to just tell these people 
[01:21:30]  sorry sorry sorry because people it took that long to find their phones you ever get anyone who you  think is maybe a fake hoarder like someone just sort of failing their house just to get on the show  fake hoarders i'm gonna start that today when you walk in you kind of wonder you know what's  what's happening here um but it's it's it's pretty rare because they really are careful to ferret out  you know really the people that can most benefit from these resources yeah you're not pathetic enough 
[01:22:00]  you're not pathetic enough leave are you we'll come back next year yeah you've got more crap lying  around i i she's wearing a wedding ring too i have i can't stop looking at it that is a rock on your  finger are you married to a doctor i'm not wow she made her own money oh my god no but i'm saying  she's married 2010 does a good job that is a rock yeah that is wow i bet you don't wear that in the  hoarder houses actually they wouldn't want it it's not a comic book or yeah but you lose it  you're never finding it insurance yo there you go you should punch him in the face with that right 
[01:22:30]  wake him up a little bit well hoarders stop collecting their shitting bags right tom green  what is this monday 10 p.m 9 central shit hoarders on uh a and e they should have a spin-off  just don't shit back just focusing on those ones specifically and focus on the shit bag i think i  love this show love it uh a lot of people are talking about it uh and yeah i think i think it's  it's fun to watch i know it is i don't really care if these people get help i i think it's good it's 
[01:23:00]  great tv but it's it's it's good on a lot of levels because it's educational for some people if  they want that it's it's entertaining if you just want that if you want like the freak show factor it's  kind of like huh watching family members yell at each other it's kind of fun and uh like i said  yeah it's educational too so uh it's like watching celebrity rehab or any other show that it's like  you're dealing with yeah everybody our whole life for the last how long has reality television  like been really you know the last few years so it's a chance to watch all of these things that 
[01:23:30]  every one of us has known existed for all these years i think that's an excellent i mean we look  at the celebrity rehab i mean that was genius you know i mean that you're right it's been happening  all along and now there's a show on it but same with hoarders and i think i don't know if genius  it might be a little strong i think that was an excellent uh assessment of the situation  you know again my involvement with hoarders is i want to go out and i want to help people  and i'm here because my whole goal um is really to keep promoting awareness and to help people  understand because i get that you know in in your your um living room and you're watching the show 
[01:24:00]  it it does make people crazy it's very very maddening and you're right pull an elvis and shoot  my television i swear you know that's why people watch angry yeah and and the reality is is if is if  it wasn't so painful to watch you wouldn't want to watch it exactly that's why it's just uh it's  very interesting very interesting show but you know two and a half minutes yes exactly you're  watching a lunatic charlie sheen is hoarding great stories he's hoarding escorts in the hotel room 
[01:24:30]  hotel bathrooms you know what we watched a rehab one one time with a girl who was was huffing  oh yeah and and you wanted to smash you she was doing the air i'm walking on sunshine and we wanted  to strangle her but they did an update on her yes i saw she's normal yep and like you don't hate her  anymore it's like she she was as hateable as you could be and then a year later she was embarrassed  by who she was oh she's like yeah it was awful she's like a regular girl now you're like okay that  goes back to the power of addiction and a lot of people say well it's hoarding a form of addiction 
[01:25:00]  well i think it's similar in the sense that they can't see their way out and here she is  you're like the doctor do a drew of uh shitbag collectors  you haven't even seen the show you said you've seen parts of it so when you come in with all  this sort of scientific stuff you really feel like dr drew except of shitbag collectors  you could change your name with dr dr shitbag collector i stopped i'm gonna stick with my name 
[01:25:30]  because i think it works for me you know but i think you know but it's an odd thing to be an  expert in now that's all i'm saying yeah you know well um the reality is is if you look at the show  there's pretty much a small group of us that are going out there a lot of uh people will specialize  in ocd and other anxiety disorders they say uh-uh i'm not going in there you know because there are  realities about health concerns yeah yeah you know there's some pretty dangerous situations  getting some mesothelioma dude there's nothing that's going to happen in this room that's going 
[01:26:00]  to freak her out by the way she deals with people who throw their own feces there's nothing that  we're going to say that's going to make her go oh she doesn't i know she's a pro you for a living  she walks into houses and people have just rotted dead animals that they live with i don't know  about that we could at least try it's probably the most sensible environment she's a very nice lady  very lovely we do like you terrific we want to go to the house when you're on the show  what if we went there and we were we kept our distance um i think it would be impossible for  you guys to do that i'm just not i want to see that kind of impulse have you ever seen to have 
[01:26:30]  the neighbors ever come over and been like oh my god thank god you're here this woman's crazy yeah  well they don't say the crazy part you know i'm very sensitive to that really they're crazy  do you ever get any weird airborne illnesses or rashes that you sort of find like you ever get a  weird sort of great question you ever get sick rashes but like we've um there's actually a show  that has not been aired that you've gotten sick i can tell you've gotten sick no no i can tell by  the way you reacted to the question you just don't want to say because it's probably really 
[01:27:00]  gnarly what was it you know was there something just really gross that you got like pus coming  out of some sort of type of worm some sort of worm a worm yeah you never want a worm have you ever  had a tapeworm um not that i'm aware of tapeworm oh my god you've had a tapeworm i can i can tell you  yeah can't you can't those things get to be like 20 feet long yeah they yeah is that a rumor  yeah no it's true no that's true can you get like some kind of disease from uh breathing in feces  yeah or not a disease some kind of illness or something i think you can definitely get you know 
[01:27:30]  illnesses and things like that i mean there's no doubt that it affects your health we just  recently saw um i mean it's really tragic but the woman who was in stage four cancer oh yeah yeah that  was the house that i told you that she was hoarding cancer cells yeah yeah she was she was going  through garbage on the floor and a bunch of dust and and that was a really really tragic situation  and you know she was the one that you know bless her heart sort of said this is really hard for me  but i don't want to leave this to my family and so she came in and while it was hard for her 
[01:28:00]  she got her environment in a place where the family could come in and i think that for any one of us  we're really struggling with something that we have to dig deep inside and find a way to motivate  ourselves and to push past like what your brain is saying is right versus you know what what you  need to do i love i love when they say they're a good cook and and you walk in and go who the hell  would eat in this crap hole it's just there's rotted food laying all over bum rd  you know so so again you know defending my clients in that sense you know the reality is is that you 
[01:28:30]  look at hoarders and you want to say she's warming up she almost she almost actually smiled there she's  she's warming up we just can't attack the people that she's helping she's not gonna go with that  she's a doctor our goal is to have her laugh one time that's all he's been laughing i've been laughing  she's very good you got a good sense of humor you could tell were they called hoarders before the  show or is that a name that the show that's what we were getting at we don't know when it started 
[01:29:00]  they just called people that just didn't throw shit out look the reality is is who's gonna get on  the phone and call somebody and say look you know my house is hoarders to the ceiling and i've got  three children can you come over and help me that is not gonna happen and yeah yeah you know with  but who came up with the name hoarders is that something the network came up with it oh no no  hoard hoarding compulsive hoarding has been there for years and years and years and um there are  lots of researchers and doctors who um have come up with this term and over time we're just 
[01:29:30]  understanding it better people calling for help though like i got it like i'm in recovery for  drinking and stuff but i had to make a decision to go get help so how come they don't they don't  have to make that decision until it's it's almost like i understand interventions work and  how but how come they don't call and go like look i need a hand here like where i had to do it and so  do other people who stopped doing that but you know you're you were in the trenches too i don't know  what your your disease looked like at the time but at one point i'm sure you denied you defended you 
[01:30:00]  rationalized why you were doing what you were doing and something changed where you said i can't live  like this anymore and that's the place that anybody in their illness in their sickness have to get to  before they're going to get help and you know i mean part of my reputation is known for having that  that gas pedal to say you know what this is insanity you can't keep living like this and to what you guys  are talking about is this is affecting the people that you love and at the same time knowing when to 
[01:30:30]  back off and to say okay you know i get this is tough for you and and to keep that balance going  i got a lot of clothes that don't fit me anymore that i'm afraid to throw out  yeah why well just because i don't know i just feel like well i spent money on that shirt  it shrunk but i i have i have a closet full of this crap say that's exactly what the hoarders do  what we're talking about early stage of hoarding not so funny anymore is it no i no i kind of feel  like i i am i have a small hoarding problem before you know it tom green's gonna have shit bags 
[01:31:00]  shit in his house yeah but you know we all say i didn't want to bring it up that's why he's here  right yeah um no we all say it on a continuum you know i keep them in the garage actually  at least it's not in the house i've seen that too but they were in buckets did you see that one the  person who had the shit in the buckets oh yeah but it was in it was in a shed i was like that's  the worst thing i've ever seen until until they showed the people who were just tossing the bags up the  stairs yeah i didn't know whether to love or hate them i kind of i kind of love their 
[01:31:30]  they're completely devil may care attitude about it well you know and one thing that we do have to  keep in mind too is that you know there's again a lot of information that doesn't come out and you  know i call the person i interview them the network's interviewing them on and on and on and  then we get there we find out oh my gosh we've got other things psychologically going on some other  issues yeah i mean you guys saw the dennis and nadine one you know can you get my pickle remember  that one oh yeah yeah yeah you know there was clearly some other things going on there that um 
[01:32:00]  you know that we couldn't discuss because again there's so much to be that's done that only gets on  air that um you know it's not up to us what gets on there yeah yeah you know you're just there to do  your job i'm just there to do my job and do whatever i can with the time that i have to help them  you know because again on the back end hopefully they will follow through with treatment and it's  very frustrating i mean i definitely have to admit that you know we see the ones that go out and then 
[01:32:30]  um you know you see the person's really angry they're yelling at the doctor they're yelling at  the organizer they don't want anything to go and they've got this amazing opportunity all these  amazing resources coming out and there's not much change when they leave and they don't take the  aftercare services that they're providing yeah they're just shopping again it's so frustrating  because in my mind i think there's one more hoarder out there that could have really benefited  from this help that now is probably because it's it's an insane amount of money to pay a doctor to 
[01:33:00]  drive to somebody's house to spend the time for and all those trucks and everything yeah absolutely  why did you why did you do this it's interesting to me anyone who gets involved in like why  as a person you you become a you a psychologist psychiatrist i don't know what would motivate you to do  that like because you have to money nah right there's got to be something that makes you want  to help people i don't get it yeah i don't you want to help people no but i mean on that level 
[01:33:30]  though no i i know my therapist sometimes how do you listen to this shit that's what i mean i'm not  talking about generally helping people but on that level i don't i don't get why you would put  yourself through that day after day was there something not to be too psychoanalytical but was there  some person that you couldn't get to that that motivates you to like i don't understand it  you know um that's the irony is i was the black sheep in my um in my class um i basically told  everybody i had no interest in sitting around hearing people's problems i'm gonna do forensic 
[01:34:00]  psychology i'm going in the courthouses i'm gonna get the information you were oh psychology  yes i thought it was like quincy like forensics i'm very excited well forensic psychology basically  people that have committed crimes that are mentally ill that kind of thing so i was going to go into  the court system get the facts write the report sit in my happy little home office send it off and you  know make my money more dough on tv though and well actually that's uh you know this is uh 12 years  later that that this hoarders has come up but um then what happened was i did an internship and i started 
[01:34:30]  work with people that had ocd and ocd is not about talking it out and going into your childhood it  doesn't mean that those things aren't important but the bottom line is it's all not all the majority  of it is behavioral it's getting them to start doing things differently so we talk about a hand  washer they have to do the what we call the exposure therapy and test out their fear that if  they touch something do something that they're not going to die or get sick and compulsive hoarding  is very much the same the idea is is if i throw this out i'm going to regret it i'm going to have 
[01:35:00]  intense anxiety you know what if i want it back you know that kind of thing and most of them find  that when they actually do it it wasn't what they expected so it's so behavioral it's so active  it's just amazing that there's this much to say about it actually it's just starting to realize  you just go on and on about it yeah they're having me back tomorrow  are you gonna yeah it's unbelievable i've got three shows people that can't throw their socks  i noticed that she hoards the word irony you should have a celebrity hoarder spin-off you know 
[01:35:30]  well there's there's there's been a few candidates really oh really i've got a bunch of old shirts  a big fan of her show ozzy and his wife that pleases me do you know that ozzy's a big yeah loves  sharon said he can't stop watching hoarders really makes me very happy that's interesting  i'm sure i'm curious what it's like to sit in his living room i'm telling english money  sharon i'm sure they have you've seen enough footage just money they're rich people yeah they 
[01:36:00]  don't think they don't hoard they hoard cash well you know i mean it's it's kind of the difference  between someone who's got a lot of money and has a space for everything so like i don't know i had  heard that mariah carey has like 10 000 pairs of shoes or some insane amount you know and she's got a  closet for him when she walks in she probably has some kind of system where she knows where to  access those shoes so that's not really hoarding but that's not hoarding because it's it's you got  the money you got the space for it and there's a system and that kind of thing versus the hoarder  house where you walk in there's 10 000 pairs of shoes and you can't find any matches yeah but the 
[01:36:30]  difference is those shoes are uh among shit yes they're covered that's the point i made earlier like  mariah carey has a shitload of shoes but it's all organized nicely in these big huge closets and then  in a hoarder's house a lot of shit shoes right and then there's yes a pile of shoes with like cat  carcasses well and you know it's rare that you're going to walk into a house and just find one  category all there are just shoes you're going to find so no it's everything it seems to be laying  all over clothes how many did the melda marcos have 10 000 that was the obsession with her for years 
[01:37:00]  people remember that 20 years later that this woman had 10 000 pairs of shoes that's it yeah  yeah well and i don't know i remember something about maybe i'm wrong like financial problems with that  and that's i think one of the things that really maddens people too when they watch the show and  they hear that people um you know they're in foreclosure or they don't have any money and  they're thinking how can they buy all this stuff but they don't have money to pay their bills and  again that's part of the illness is the the difficulty that they have resisting a good deal  versus you know at the end of the day paying bills i got a good question i'm a big fan of twitter 
[01:37:30]  i i actually hoard tweets but uh there's a guy conway tweety conway tweety no but he's got something  of course he's on twitter but he's got something he really does i got a friend who stabbed himself  in the arm with a pencil because he couldn't find a photo what do you think his illness is i have no  idea you got me on that way you know i typically have an answer for everything this is really  something that actually i was setting jimmy up jimmy talked about uh uh just that yesterday yeah 
[01:38:00]  jimmy was going a little nuts he likes he likes getting celebrity photos that is his thing even though  even though at this point he's more famous than most of the people he's taking pictures no not i but  i get a lot of the people you certainly are jimmy you're downplaying it but he couldn't find a  certain photo yesterday and he got so mad he actually stabbed his sort of stabbed your arm  no no no scraped it with an unsharpened pencil it was an unsharpened pencil let's see the wound  it's nothing let's it's nothing he took an unsharpened pencil and went because he was searching for 
[01:38:30]  this photo that he wanted and couldn't find it you get mad at yourself you know how it is you just get  it was an act of anger now you're a cutter well i was years ago but pencil i'm a good boy now are  you years ago yeah well i was a kid yeah wow i was a teenager yeah cut yourself how many times  really not in 25 years oh my gosh just want to feel exactly what it was teenage melodrama  notice me that was a douche and you know jimmy i gotta keep going back to you because you know 
[01:39:00]  one might say why would you cut yourself like that that does not make any sense yeah so hoarding  doesn't make any sense why you would take a razor blade or knife and cut yourself that doesn't make  any sense either but there's an illness aspect to it that people can't understand there is i mean it's  like it's it's you can't even argue that point because it's like people who drunk drive and  fucking i mean i know people have done it it's like nobody wakes up and goes all right today i'm  gonna drink and then plow into a family yeah but you do exactly you know i hope no one wakes up and 
[01:39:30]  says that that makes it even more devious that would be terrible why are you drinking i'm hoping to hit  someone and i think we're in a society where everything really needs to make sense good way  to get a tv show there needs to be a logical reason why we're doing something yeah and i think when we  can get to a place where sometimes we can understand that it's not so logical it's not logical for  someone to cut on themselves it's not logical for someone um you know to get in a car and you know  be drunk themselves with a pencil but stab yourself with a pencil for gosh sakes unsharpened because it 
[01:40:00]  sounds it sounds irrational the other way yes yes as long as it's not sharp i bit my calf do you  understand how mad i was i had to do that i i just i realized i could i was so mad at myself  but i actually just picked my leg up and bit my calf let me see how you can do that yeah i'm looking  for a visual i'm trying to see yeah absolutely can you reach i will believe it i've tried to reach  a little i've learned that move for other reasons it never quite worked out i got close ones  oh my god let me see i used to have a big bruise right on now i can relate i've got a bit of a 
[01:40:30]  drive to my next uh yeah we should chat a little we should have a little talk no i can relate to  that i bite between my bicep and my shoulder and it feels so good when you do it interesting i'm not  saying that we're normal here doc yeah no we're all crazy we got our issues but i know i have my  issues no bags of shit though yes well that's why the anger yeah yeah we got to take it out on  somebody yeah yeah as they say you point one finger three point back at you see i say that on dates a 
[01:41:00]  lot tom anything else you good you go with the hoarder man i'm almost afraid to ask uh another  question i think you're good i think i gotta i don't know yeah i want to talk about uh money what  i'm up to these yes exactly we'll do that after we're pulling me out of here in 15 minutes  are you serious i gotta go to the fox news thing or something like that this will be the plug to  where tom's gonna be i would like to keep talking about it tom's at comics i want to talk about your  shirts that you can't get rid of but i know if i say one more thing to you you're just going to

[01:43:30]  very first podcast my very first guest was uh bill burr who's a friend of you guys yes so we had a  great great uh kevin smith has this podcast theater and i've been doing my own little uh podcast out  of there so for about three weeks now oh wow i've been hanging out with bill burr quite a bit you know  he's a good guy when do you do the podcast i do it tuesday nights when i'm in la it's on itunes you can  download it on itunes and uh and you get get it at tom green.com yeah but it's nice so it's fun  you're always tom's always like you're always like you're at the forefront of like uh having an 
[01:44:00]  interview show in your house i mean you're a very creative dude when it comes to kind of keeping  yourself out there and your show is extremely creative you don't seem to take the conventional  ways of getting things done yeah you know well i don't know i just i i've always liked the computers  you know i like the computer so i mean when the when you start putting the video on the computers  yeah i enjoy that but you know i i've been i think i'm going a little crazy though i think i'm going  a little crazy this year i've been on the road for a year now since i last saw you guys you've been  on the road since the last time i haven't stopped i haven't been on the road every i've been home a 
[01:44:30]  couple i've been gone non-stop i did uh i don't think i'd gone to australia yet when i was here last  time had i know i don't know i did i did a whole thing there i've been everywhere and it's how was  australia i've debated going are they good it was amazing i had the most amazing tour over tour over  there and it was just it was but uh you know it's been it's been it's been uh yeah it was great  australia was great everyone's really drunk the audience is really drunk they talk to you a lot  though very oh really interactive very raucous audiences yeah which is sort of like uh it  changes it's it's a fun it's funny i got those two kinds of shows that i have i have shows where  people come the stand-up comedy club and they're coming to see stand-up and then sometimes if i play 
[01:45:00]  more like rock venues and things like that it's a little more screaming and yelling so i can't do  shows where they're standing like i like them like like brewer can brewer's an animal he can do shows  in a rock club where they're standing for an hour and murder i can't do it and if i do a rock club  i take less money because they have to be seated like so instead of 900 people it's 350 or 400  i can't do it can you do them standing i can't do them i've never done that well i just i just did a  show in toronto three days ago or whatever in toronto and they we did a show at the club called 
[01:45:30]  the phoenix and they put seats in there's normally not seats there but then people were standing all  around the back so it was kind of like one of those those kind of environments and i neglected to mention  i don't mind when people are yelling though i kind of like that you like that well it's just  different it's i prefer it i prefer it in the straight stand-up club you know like uh like the  best shows i had this year i think were at places like uh san francisco at cobs that's great yeah and  it's just sort of a real stand-up crowd people listen to you they're listening what you have to say  you know i like your videos tom big fan of the videos because you've been on the road for over a 
[01:46:00]  year yeah taking videos here and there and the one that made me laugh really hard you just happened to  be in cleveland when lebron james announced that he was leaving yeah yeah you're trying to interview  people on the street yeah the city was just uh nuts people just going nuts over there about oh  about that but uh yeah we might make videos i'm a video hoarder i shoot videos everywhere i go if  you go to my website go to tom green.com there's like video every day i shoot a video every day  yeah i feel like um i don't want to say anything i feel like robin's just assessing everything that 
[01:46:30]  we're saying and what type of sicknesses what type of sicknesses we have we're very easy most of us  are very simple we're not that complicated we're all fucking she could probably spend five minutes  with each one of us with me you got your so let's just be clear so um you bite your leg it all it all  stab your arm um yes it all comes from having oversized genitals um it's a big problem a real big  problem it's like you know we're fucking we're dealing with that level of lunacy or or or mental 
[01:47:00]  illness to be yeah this is very mild stuff compared to i think the more i'm doing stand-up  this year i've been doing it all year so but i hadn't really done this full time like this i think  like when i say i'm going crazy i think i'm really starting to because you get up on stage every night  you're venting about stuff you're angry about right then you get angrier and angry and angry about the  world and then you start to think well i can't be angry on stage because people don't want to see  someone who's angry right but you know you sort of like for instance this charlie sheen thing for  instance right you're sitting there you look into this the guy's on the front page of the paper 
[01:47:30]  because he trashes a hotel room right and is caught with a bunch of uh hookers and blow right  and then you see then you look over at this tv and then is uh denise richards was on the tv this  morning right and then above denise richards was the the elliot spitzer was on the tv this morning  the hero yes and then on and then on your show it's just a bunch of retards that like just keep  a bunch of bags of shit right so it's like what do you have to do to get on television now in this  country you know you got either collect a bag of shit or get caught with a prostitute or you know  it's it's it's that's what's great she did not like your assessment by the way of her well he 
[01:48:00]  might have but that's what's sort of starting to make me it's starting to make me angry it just  seems like this sort of bad behavior thing that's you know we're rewarding bad behavior in our  society voyeurism is also part of it i think because it's not interesting to watch people who are  healthy like it's not interesting to watch a guy who gets up and goes to work and has a loving  relationship with his wife i mean that's better but who wants to see that shit i want to watch a guy  who gets caught getting blown by uh that's what made hugh granistar it was like the fact that he got  caught being blown please i give me times i've done that i just never got caught i think the 
[01:48:30]  other aspect though is that charlie sheen is his career is blowing up in a positive way because  people watching that show because they like the show or are they watching the show because he's  on the front page of the new york post trashed you know i don't know i don't i don't find the  show that funny i mean do people like that show i don't like you know i mean it's sort of like  some sort of i guess i don't like that kind of middle of the road stuff like that horse shit  people even people yeah that horse shit sitcom crap i hate that shit man i hate that shit but  people watch it because it's like oh there's something there's something there's there's like 
[01:49:00]  it's like bugs flying into a lamp you know it's like you know he's on the cover of the new york  post today because he trashed a hotel room they sent a private jet for the guy to bring him home  to protect the the golden boy right but it's it's it's insanity i think the whole you know we're all  going crazy right so that's that's me i'm losing my mind that's what i want to say i need help  it's frustrating right yeah it's frustrating because you want you want to be on tv doing  some real shit listen i did my i started my show on a public access station and i was i wanted to be  do sort of a david letterman type of thing and i'm like well no one's ever going to pay any 
[01:49:30]  attention to this so i go and i went and sucked milk out of a cow's udder you know then they're  like oh what the hell there's a guy sucking milk out of a cow's udder on tv everybody look at that  then they looked at that and then they sort of see some of the cool things the funny things you're  doing in the background but the end of the day you sort of realize you got to do something  really fucking wrong in order to get on television in this country you know everybody on tv is either  uh lindsey lohan those you know people getting duis people getting thrown in prison you know  i don't know i think i think it's a statement on us not the celebrities because they're just doing 
[01:50:00]  what they've always been doing but it's it's it's the neediness of the public or the sick fascination  with it because uh why do we why do we why can we not look like why can we not get enough of tiger  woods why can we we love watching people's personalized fall it's also because we have  like these we have like 500 channels now all these different media outlets there's so much competition  that people have to go to the sensational stuff right well the media is also it's very so cliche to 
[01:50:30]  blame the media but they have become disgusting where it's not about getting the story right it's  about getting it first and you know their ratings driven i think years ago it wasn't about maybe it  always was on some level but the news departments weren't supposed to make money but now that that's  the whole franchise they're making money they have to keep they have to they have to keep viewers keep  ratings because that's how the advertising dollars roll in bullshit the news that uh to you every day and  they still but they still have the whole uh thing of well with the news so we get away with more  right when it comes to the fcc they have more uh lenience with content even though they're driven just 
[01:51:00]  like sitcoms which is doc we're really smart and i just canceled my facebook page you on facebook  why i just canceled my because that's driving me crazy i can't stand that thing i canceled my facebook  canceled it it's driving me crazy too many too many people you know like it's so i'm off that i think  everybody should cancel their facebook that's my new i minimize mine to people i know yeah just my  friends got to you tom something got to you i just think that you know i just i know no no no i i still 
[01:51:30]  i still get lots of lots of haters on my website so that's no problem as long as you're getting the  haters yes no i think it's actually just because i have a general problem with uh with social media  now it's not even about my personal one because i didn't really go on it that much but i've been  talking about how i'm sort of anti-social media now and uh i've been talking about this a lot on stage  and i started realizing after my shows people have become up to me and saying well well you got a  facebook page i mean how can you be ranting about that so i was feeling like a hypocrite so i can't get rid of it  yeah i think i think the social media is gonna turn into something way better than it is right 
[01:52:00]  now are you tweeting i'm still tweeting yeah i love twitter though it's great it's a way to tell  jokes to 50 000 people at one moment it's facebook specifically you really yeah i think you i think  people got to cancel it you don't like when people invite you to a pillow fight i don't think married  people should be on facebook i think if you're married you got to cancel your facebook because it's  all just about having uh sex or something yeah i just don't think you know i just i just think it was  it was a better system back in the 70s you have one telephone in your house that's the way you  communicate with the outside world one phone that's it facebook you get information coming 
[01:52:30]  from all sides you get these secret messages coming in the background from ex-girlfriends and  yeah you can find people that you never would have seen in your life ever again people that you  never want to see ever again yeah yeah there was no way you would ever see anybody and then and of  course cell phone you have you're accessible all the time no matter where you are no now but you  don't have to answer the phone like you used to either years ago your fucking house phone would  ring hello oh it's you again this way they just send you a message you don't read it so i kind of 
[01:53:00]  like it because even though they can contact you more easily you don't have to call them back and  you don't have to deal with that that's actually why i canceled my facebook right there you just made  me jog my memory to why i canceled because everyone sends you the message and then you look at it  and you they know you've seen it but you can't you don't want to respond to it and then you're like  suddenly an asshole for not responding to them but if you don't have the facebook at all  then you they can't get the message to you just write back cool lol send just send some bullshit 
[01:53:30]  message back and then just be really dismissive and then they stop once again uh tom green's gonna  be at comics yeah comics this weekend friday and saturday night come see my i'm gonna come by and  see you because i'm in the city this week oh great awesome i'm happy that you're uh you're back in  oh yeah you want to you want to jump up and do uh do a set oh loud yeah that'd be cool i want to  get yelled at yeah that'd be cool yeah that'd be awesome you have to come down you know what i  liked about uh seeing you at comics you talked about drew barrymore i was scared to bring it up  on the show last time you were here oh yeah i'm very open about your oh my god oh you stopped talking  about it i stopped talking about that yeah i stopped talking about it well you know i didn't but you 
[01:54:00]  were very open about it it was it was kind of cool to hear you know it was it was kind of like talk  about i think i think what was going on there was the first it's the first year of doing  stand-up like this and and i think in the beginning there was sort of an insecurity that i  had where if i jump up on stage you know i was thinking oh this is the gorilla in the room or  something i'm gonna have to you know no pun intended i'm gonna have to say something about  this right in order to uh in order to get out of the way but i've realized now that it's just a  downer you know it's just a downer getting up talking about being divorced and stuff so i've 
[01:54:30]  stopped talking about that altogether okay and uh you know i've gotten a lot more confident on stage  you know and uh and since since then and uh you know i've just decided you know i'm just  going to keep it positive i'm going to talk about fun funny stuff and stuff that you know uh you know  he's losing his mind i'm losing my mind yeah i see it i see it but as i move forward you're losing  your mind yeah i know i know well just film it i've been losing my mind for years i've been losing  my mind for years there's a way to process it though where it's it does get frustrating and you feel  like when you start to notice everything and it starts to make you very angry it's like you want to 
[01:55:00]  just go on stage and and fucking bottleneck and explode but there's a way to colin's really great  at that colin quinn at taking things that i know make him want to bite people's face i know he wants  to physically attack some of the people he's talking about right but don't let it block what  you're doing on stage and he's the best at that but i think what's happening with you you've been  on the road too long yeah maybe well i'm taking a break i'm taking my i'm taking a break uh next week  i'm gonna take two weeks off then i'm going up to east coast of canada i'm gonna do nova scotia  four shows up there and then i'm taking a month off it gets old right the road no no i've been 
[01:55:30]  loving it it's been fun actually but it's just a little tiring sitting on planes all the time my  back hurts right you know but actually i have a great time it's been it's been an amazing year  it's been probably the most exciting year i've had in a long and you're a big hockey uh fan right  yeah pretty much you know i know i would assume uh ottawa senators ottawa senators although i am  wearing uh maple leaf jersey right now to be honest with you yeah which is bizarre but that's  because i was just in toronto and i ran out of laundry so i uh i picked up a maple leaf jersey  you brought some of those tiny shirts you have literally that's being on the road you know you're 
[01:56:00]  on the road i'm living out of a tiny suitcase i ran out of laundry i picked up a leaf jersey at  the airport but actually i'm a senator's fan i mean the fact that i'm wearing this right now oh my god  i'm gonna i'm gonna get beat up next time i brought it up then the doc is starting to feel sorry for you  by the way i should have said that shit thing over and over again because she's gonna help you  you know you're crazy but you know i hear that you're starting to get a lot more focused and  figure out where you're headed and what you really want and what makes you happy no i think so you  know and uh i think that's a good thing it's a nice thing it's a great thing beyond the road very 
[01:56:30]  independent uh little uh little world that i've stumbled into here i can't go out for a long time  i mean because basically the radio show but even when i wasn't on i go out for a weekend and come home  i never like to be gone for more maybe 10 days i never like to be gone for a month i don't know how  comedians do that i think it's just because it's my you know probably the first year of really doing  it i'm just having so much fun writing and uh and really kind of uh you know i've become very  addicted to it yeah but you know i've did oh that's cool i've taken a week off here and there  and then i take a week off and i start to kind of get really antsy and uh then once i get back to 
[01:57:00]  the airport i start to feel oh home again you get lonely jimmy you get lonely no but i get uh bored  the road's boring i like to go on stage in new york i like to come back and do the cellar every night or do  stand up new york or whatever club i want to go on at i would rather come back and work on material  than just be out you know three or four days what are you gonna do a thursday through sunday then  you're off monday tuesday what do you do that's the one tgi friday that stinks that's the one thing  that's hard when you're traveling so much it's hard to start to stop and actually write new ideas and  things like yeah and go up on a monday it's good to go up on a monday and and do 15 minutes and tape 
[01:57:30]  you tape every set right of course you do yeah we've actually and that's the other thing i'm traveling  with my friend tony and we're bringing like five cameras with us and we shoot everything multi-camera  and we're making sort of all sorts of web videos and call yeah so you know i've got a little  hundreds of hours of hundreds that's the cool thing about you know this day and age you know i got  we got a you know we got a four gigabyte hard drive with us we're shooting hundreds of hours of video  literally because we're shooting five cameras of every set oh wow four sets a week and we're shooting  like you know 60 hours of footage every week you know so it's just do you feel you need so much 
[01:58:00]  footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage footage 
[01:58:30]  Tom has to capture every moment.  Tom's got to go.  You're saying you've got to go.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to go.  You should come back.  You've got TV.  We blow off the other interview?  What time do we have Huey Lewis?  It's not cool to do that.  Don't blow off Hux.  Why don't you try to come back if you're in town for the next few days?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely do that.  I don't want to put the pressure on, but if you want to come back, we'd love to have you.  Oh, no, any time.  The hoarder lady will be gone, so don't worry about that.  Oh, leave Robin alone.  We love Robin.  To be honest with you, I leave tomorrow.  Tomorrow, I fly to Arizona, do a show at Arizona State University, and then I fly back for my shows this weekend. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, okay.  So I'll be here Thursday.  So I'll be here, am I back Thursday?  I'm back Friday.  Your only shows, Tom, are here, Comics New York.  It's Friday and Saturday, this October, 2930.  7.30, 10 p.m.  That's a busy time around there, too, because Halloween is coming up.  I might bring a Halloween costume every night.  Come dress, wear costumes.  You know, don't cover your faces, though. 
[01:59:30]  I want to see your faces.  I don't want a crowd full of people wearing, like, rubber masks or something.  If you had my audience, you would.  2-1-2, 5-2-4, 2-5-0.  And it's TomGreen.com.  Or the website is Comics New York, with one word, C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com.  And Tom, just a hilarious dude, man.  I'm looking forward to seeing you this weekend.  Oh, great.  I'm so glad you could come down.  And before we go to break, of course, the doctor has given us great radio today.  Robin, I don't know how to say your last name. 
[02:00:00]  Zazio.  Zazio, I'm sorry.  Hoarders on A&E, Mondays at 10 p.m., 9 central.  And we all love the Hoarders show.  Yes.  Hey, Jim, if you come, come to a late show, and then we'll drink afterwards.  I don't drink.  Yeah, I'm kind of trying to quit, too, but I'll have a beer.  A beer.  Oh, I can't.  A beer.  Tom, one's too many.  A thousand's not enough.  Oh, we'll have a Coca-Cola.  We'll have a Coca-Cola then.  You can have a Coca-Cola.  That I can do, although I'm trying to avoid aspartame now.  So I'd be happy to have a bottle of water.  I've really turned into a queer.  Have a bottle of water and, you know.  I'll be happy just to read Zen and jerk you off. 
[02:00:30]  I don't really suck.  Definitely come to a late show.  Sorry you had to hear that, doctor.  She's very responsible.  Definitely come to a late show.  Sounds like a plan.  All right, we're going to take a break and figure this out, so I'll stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  All right.  I want to thank Tom Green for stopping by again. 
[02:01:00]  I like him, man.  I like the Tom Green.  The original jackass.  Exactly.  He was doing the jackass stuff before the jackass guy.  He was doing all the stunting.  He sure was, man.  And what not.  We got Huey Lewis coming in today.  Huey Lewis in the news.  It's MTV Day today on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We had fun with him last time, though.  That's why we're having him back.  Huey's a good egg.  What is he promoting?  I guess he's got a new album.  Does he have a new album, or is it a greatest hits thing, or brandy new? 
[02:01:30]  Is it just him, or is it the news also?  Huey is long rumored to have a very large penis.  There's your fun fact of the day.  Wow.  Do we ask him about his big giant hog?  I don't know.  I guess.  I think you guys did, back in 2005, when he was in.  Yeah, we asked him that once.  I don't remember.  We could ask him if it got any bigger, I guess.  Might as well.  What else is going on? 
[02:02:00]  What else is going on?  Oh, you're Yankee fans there.  Fucked it up, man.  You're not going to get Cliff Lee next year.  Well, I think Cliff Lee...  You can't spit on his wife.  I think he understands.  And expect the Yankees to sign her husband.  Excuse me, it's a compliment to spit on the wife of a pitcher.  Really?  Because it means he's so good that he's aggravating the fans so much that you feel compelled to spit on his wife.  He'll be in pinstripes. 
[02:02:30]  Cliff Lee will?  Yeah.  We said this last year, and it didn't happen.  Eh, well, I have to...  He'll be there this year.  No, he won't.  Yankees are on the decline.  He wants to be with the winner.  What?  Yeah, it's over for you guys.  A-Rod sucks a dick.  Is that it?  A-Rod sucks.  Damn it.  He finally did something last year in the playoffs, but he's back to being what we all remember A-Rod doing.  Choking in the fucking playoffs.  He thought he was going to be able to ride out last year for two years.  It doesn't work that way.  And Derek Jeter getting up there a little bit.  Derek is still an amazing player. 
[02:03:00]  I hope he re-signs with the Yankees.  As a sports fan, it would be nice to see one player do his whole career with one team.  He's re-signing.  Very rare that happens.  There's no chance he's going anywhere else.  What do you got in the World Series?  First of all, who's playing?  That's how much interest I have in the World Series.  I could care less.  The Giants with the guy that dyes his beard or goatee very blank.  That looks like a fake beard, doesn't it?  It looks like he's wearing a disguise.  It's his thing, I guess. 
[02:03:30]  A disguise.  On Fox and Friends or one of these horseshit news programs, they just had one of their guys do it.  Oh, do that?  Yeah, because you've got to relate to the World Series any way you can.  I go, uh, I go, uh, I go, uh, I go, uh, I go Giants.  Fuck it.  I'm going to go Texas.  I say Texas.  Go Rangers.  Texas.  Texas in six.  I don't really need to watch that.  No?  Nah.  No, I say Texas in five. 
[02:04:00]  I don't need to watch the World Series.  I don't know.  Don't expect the Giants to get there, though.  Everyone thought it was going to be Philly.  Texas in five.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I got hockey to watch.  I got the Jets to watch.  Texas in five.  I don't need the World Series.  You guys need the World Series.  I'm not going to watch it.  I got two strong teams and other fucking, uh, sports to follow.  I wish I liked it.  There isn't even an outrage about the World Series being on and Fox not being on, uh, CableVision.  No.  There's no outrage about that because no one really gives a flying fuck about, uh, the 
[02:04:30]  World Series here in, uh, New York.  Oh, here in New York.  Here in New York.  Like, it's one of those things where it's like, ah, well, I don't get CableVision.  Who cares?  Ah, yeah.  Who cares?  Oh.  I'm going to take you to a hockey game, Jimmy.  I'm going to try to, uh, turn you.  Um, I heard the, uh, maybe.  I heard the live ones are pretty good.  What do you mean, maybe?  It's a hang.  Me and you hang it.  Oh, hang it for sure.  It's not about the actual game.  All right.  Why not?  I might be scared.  What if somebody beats me up?  You're not going to get beat up.  What if people don't like me?  They'll like you.  I want to be very popular in the hockey game. 
[02:05:00]  I'll get you some cotton candy.  And the Capital One popcorn is terrific.  Ah.  There's no lettuce and tomato on mine.  Who got with my sandwich?  Oh, no.  The way it's going today, probably Stevie.  He's fucked up everything else today.  Probably got your sandwich.  He's also the only intern, I think.  Maybe kind of didn't tell him.  Where's Stevie?  Oh, hold on.  Stevie's not having a good day.  Why isn't he having a good day?  He's messing up.  Because he's blind.  I ain't playing this shit. 
[02:05:30]  What are you talking about?  I'm not playing this shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nah, it's a good idea.  It is a good idea.  Yeah.  I have no lettuce and tomato on my sandwich.  Oh, well, you can have the tomato that Danny didn't ask for, but he got on his sandwich.  All right.  I said he messed it up a little bit.  Stevie messes up everything.  Oh, San Fran's catchphrase is fear the beard.  Thank you, Footer, for that.  Don't have time to go to you right now.  Oh, who are they singing that to?  Fear the beard.  It's the giant.  Carol Brady?  The giant's pitcher. 
[02:06:00]  You missed it.  My wife.  Yes.  Haven't had a Steve reference in a while.  Fear the beard.  I didn't want to send tomato on my sandwich.  Oh, boy.  Oh, who's fault is that?  Who got the sandwich?  Danny might not have told her, though.  Who got the sandwich?  It's my mistake.  But who went?  Was it Stevie?  No, no.  Okay.  That's all I wanted to know.  Stevie doesn't have the security clearance for food.  There is such a thing, by the way. 
[02:06:30]  Stevie doesn't have security.  No, you've got to be here a while for Kenny to trust you with the food for the guys.  But besides that, there was another mistake made on that order.  What?  If you notice your beverage.  It's a Diet Coke.  Who made that mistake?  You?  No.  No.  The lettuce and tomato was an oversight on my part.  Boo!  Boo!  But somebody else bought a regular Coke instead of a Diet Coke.  Oh.  So, you know, I thought, like, you wanted your sandwich, like, right away, because by now 
[02:07:00]  I would have had time to replace it for Diet, but I grabbed you a Diet Ginger Ale.  That's okay.  Who got the regular Coke?  Was it the brood?  The brood.  Oh, my God.  Was it the chick?  They all worked to the best of their abilities.  Who was it?  The best of their disabilities.  Yeah.  Was it the brood?  Okay.  Okay.  You got him.  You cracked him. 
[02:07:30]  It was you?  Kenny couldn't take the interrogation.  Okay.  I hate your happiness right now.  I know.  Look at his smile.  It's so big.  Why are you so happy, Kenny?  It's a very big smile.  No, because, you know, the buck stops here.  The schmuck stops here.  I know.  I wish the bumper did.  Is the hoarder's doc here still?  We forgot to show her the drawer where you're collecting all the fucking little ketchup and  stuff.  Oh, the condiments and stuff?  He's a condiment hoarder. 
[02:08:00]  Are you still collecting the condiments?  I was going to say, hey, doc, I have a hard time making friends, you motherfucker.  Can you help me?  That old gag.  Yeah, that's a friend of mine used to say that joke.  So who went for the sandwich?  A trustworthy intern.  It was just a minor mistake.  What set of genitals does this intern have? 
[02:08:30]  Cock or cut?  Oh, you got a 50-50 chance there of guessing.  I think it's a girl.  She's usually very good.  I don't care.  Yeah.  It was just a miscommunication.  And when there's a miscommunication, it's the sender's fault, not the receiver's.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Yeah.  How's your headache, Anthony?  Oh, it's good now. 
[02:09:00]  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.  The Excedrin works.  I wish it was Excedrin PM.  Right.  Because then I could have, you know, taken a nap or something.  Right.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah, dummy.  What a dolt.  That kid really is stupid.  Stevie.  There is a line that has to be drawn between entertaining intern and functional.  I do understand, you know, he's entertaining at times.  I had to have a talk with Stevie in the office just before. 
[02:09:30]  Did you?  Yeah, because, I mean, it's just, it's like every day.  And I had to give him that whole look.  You know, no one's ever going to give you any more responsibilities until you can get the  very basic things correct and consistent.  He didn't like, you know, he just sat there with his head up there.  He's not going to get smart overnight.  No, no.  Here's what he's going to.  We purposely hired a dummy.  Why don't we understand that?  I understand that, but there's a problem when all you do is hire dummies.  We hire one dummy.  One dummy.  One per shift is okay.  But any more than that is going to become a problem.  Yeah, it's upsetting the interns. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, and then there's the interns.  But he's not going to get smart.  No, he's going to end up, here's what his life is going to be.  He's going to end up in a trade, either a roofer or something, like a helper for something.  He can't see.  Not even that.  He's going to be stocking shelves in a grocery store.  How's he going to climb a ladder?  I mean like a helper, though.  I think he'll get an on-air job someday.  Oh, stop it.  He's good at sports.  He's the guy who's cleaning up the McDonald's tables, like, slowly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's going to be him.  He's going to be a Walmart greeter. 
[02:10:30]  A Walmart greeter.  He could be that.  He has that Down syndrome.  He's just blind.  No, he's kind of stupid, too.  He would never know who to greet.  He's waving to shopping carts.  Greeting a robber.  Someone comes in with a gun.  Welcome to Walmart.  Hey, he's an idiot.  We're overlooking the obvious.  Yes?  He could become a serious XM executive.  Oh, whoa.  That's pretty strong.  Bleep that out, please.  You're scared for your job, aren't you?  They don't like jokes.  Since I'm not signed yet. 
[02:11:00]  They hate jokes down the hall.  God forbid we make jokes on this show at their expense.  That coming from the guy that gets cereal.  I'm a good fetcher.  Coffee boy.  Coffee.  I moved up from piss catcher.  Not in my eyes.  No.  What do we got going on, man?  We got Huey Lewis coming in in a few minutes.  Here's Stevie outside.  I like the fact that Conan is saying he's going to do his bitch, and if they want to 
[02:11:30]  sue him, they can.  Like the masturbating bear.  He's like, no, what are they going to do?  Oh, really?  I'm just reading that.  It's about time someone does that.  I respect that.  Stevie.  I'm going to prove you all wrong.  Oh, shit.  That's what they say before they shoot everybody in the workplace.  I'm going to prove to you that I'm a good intern because I'm going to bring something very  good to the show Friday.  What, your retirement papers?  But I am not telling you what it is.  No, I'm not telling you what it is. 
[02:12:00]  Your retirement papers.  Your retirement papers.  You wish.  It was 19.  You're going to bring something to the show Friday.  Yes, I am.  That is going to negate everything that you have done up to this point.  Does anyone else know about this, Stevie?  Yeah, Sam does.  Of course Sam does.  And I think a handful of the interns know, too, but we only have a handful.  We have two interns, dolt.  Exactly.  To him, it's four.  That's true.  He thinks there's a crowd out there. 
[02:12:30]  How do you hire so many twins?  Sam, is it a good thing that he's bringing Friday?  Dummy.  Yeah, what are you going to do besides, are you going to shave your Amish beard on Friday?  We hate it.  Sam, whatever it is, I know he has faith in it.  I don't know what he has planned for Friday.  What are you going to do Friday?  Selective Amnesia again with Sam.  All right.  I can't.  I'm not.  What's old Velour Head doing?  Should I tell him?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  Why not?  We're going to forget as soon as you tell us, so you might as well.  Me and Sam decided.  Sam and I.  Sam and I.  Sam and I.  Me and Sam.  It would be a good idea Friday.  Today, I'm going to bring my mother in to visit this, visit the studio.  Of course, fuck her.  Sam said that she should come on.  Can we point at her woman, boo?  That's your mom.  Why would you do that?  That's your mom.  It wasn't my idea.  It was someone else's idea. 
[02:13:30]  And then Sam's like, oh, yeah, you should do that.  What kind of lady is she?  Stevie came in looking for attention, as he always does, saying, I want to bring your dad  and screw your mom.  Your dad is what fucked you up.  I want to watch him beat you up like he does at home.  Please no.  Really?  Yeah.  He looks down and gets serious.  What does your dad look like?  Like, if you had a picture of a celebrity that he looks like, who would it be?  I've had cousins that have confused him for Santa Claus.  Like, little cousins.  Is that Santa Claus?  So, is he like a biker-looking guy?  No.  Does he have a big white beard? 
[02:14:00]  He's bad.  He looks old for his, like, he's 53, but he looks older than that.  He's pretty much, he's 53.  Uh-huh.  But he looks way older.  Like, he's almost completely bald.  He's completely gray.  Gray, full beard and mustache.  And he's got a gut that's, like, out to here.  Uh-huh.  I mean, he really, like, he really looks like Santa Claus.  Like, it's no joke.  Does he drink?  No.  No.  So, why the big beer belly?  He's just...  He gets his high from beating you.  He's pretty fat.  That's it, right? 
[02:14:30]  I guess.  You don't like your dad at all?  I hate him.  You hate him?  I hate him.  Are they divorced, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're divorced.  Does your mom have a new man in her life?  Not at the moment.  Really?  Not at the moment?  Not at the moment.  Uh-oh.  Does she date a lot?  Um, not so much lately.  What do you mean?  But, um...  She did?  For a little bit, but she's just been, you know, taking it easy right now.  What kind of guys was she bringing over?  Young studs?  Young bucks?  What color?  Yeah, what color?  Does she date outside of her race? 
[02:15:00]  Actually, one time, right after they split up, she brought home a Spanish guy.  Oh, nice unclipped cock.  And he was, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah, but we would...  A barrio thug.  Giving her a fucking deep dicking while he kept his shirt buttoned in the top button.  Barrio thug!  With that net on his hair.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Alms.  Alms, eh.  He's sticking gang signs up her.  Sorry. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  No disrespect.  She dated a Spanish guy.  Yeah, big, big young dick.  Yeah, but me and my sisters weren't crazy about that, so we kind of...  We drove him away.  Had to drive him away.  We just showed...  We showed him how fucked up our family was, and he's like, okay, I'm out.  What?  Wow, you gotta have a fucked up family.  Well, yeah, what we did was we dragged...  You gotta chase a Spanish guy away.  Yeah, we dragged my dad over to where my mom was living at the time, and made, like,  the whole scene, and he was there, and he saw her, and he's like, I'm getting out of  here.  So we basically...  Was he younger?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Like...  How much?  Like, I think, like, 20 years.  You cock-blocked your mom getting some young dick after your awful dad?  Why?  Because it was really soon after they split up, and we were still pretty young at that  point, and we just couldn't handle my mom having somebody else besides our dad as  a...  Okay, fair enough.  Even though he beat you.  You probably fucked him really well, though.  Yeah.  Do you have a very good one?  I don't want to think about that.  Do you ever wonder if he fucked her really well?  Well, I don't want and wonder about that.  Any guys that you've liked that have, uh, she's dated?  No, I haven't liked anyone.  She's...  It's like...  She brings...  Like, she's brought home, like, these really, like... 
[02:16:30]  Like, no one likable, like...  No one likable.  Like, it's either they're really weird, or they're, like, just...  Just...  You want to have sex with your mom.  No, I don't.  Cheryl Tiggs.  Hello.  No, it's not...  Hello, Cheryl Tiggs.  Now I know what it's all about.  No.  And you're cock-blocking your mom.  What?  You can admit it.  I don't want to admit it.  You can admit it.  You're among friends.  Just tell me another second.  I don't.  You sure, though?  What'd she look like?  Have you ever thought about it?  No.  You have, yeah, I see.  No.  Not at all. 
[02:17:00]  Sam, no.  I don't want to.  Oh, why are you all excited?  You sure?  Some feelings coming up?  No.  No.  See, the thing is that, you know, my...  We're all really close to my mom, and, you know, we just...  Close.  No, it's not...  Why did your dad mistreat your mom?  He mistreated everyone on the phone.  I don't want to go down this road.  That's why...  That's so depressing.  That's why they're all close.  This little nest thing happened.  Oh, what's going on?  They're all protecting each other. 
[02:17:30]  I can't...  I can't do it anymore.  I can't do that shit.  Do what?  His father was a complete fucking asshole.  Mistreated the mom and the kids, so the mom and the kids are very protective of each  other and very close.  Yeah, but it doesn't sound like...  But it sounds like mom's kind of dragging home guys just to fucking have sex with her.  Mom's looking for some dicks, so what?  God bless her.  She's trying to find a...  God bless.  I don't...  I don't want to make that...  She's trying to find a father for her fucking half-retarded kids. 
[02:18:00]  So she wants to have...  She wants to have...  She wants that feeling of...  When a guy bottoms out.  Have you ever heard your mom getting a dicking?  No.  You've never heard her moaning?  Thank God, no.  You live in the same house.  She brings guys home.  Come on.  Don't lie.  You've heard...  I don't want to make it sound like she's dating all the time.  She's dating on and off.  Whatever.  You've heard it.  You've heard it.  You ever smell fucking in the house?  Ew.  Like you walk in and it just smells like body.  Come on.  My mom's very...  Fess up.  She will not let any of that stuff happen in our house because... 
[02:18:30]  What?  She doesn't have sex in her house?  Where's she fucking in the car?  She's...  She might be doing...  Danny just pulled up a picture of a...  That's your mom?  That's not my mom.  Stevie, that's your mom?  No, it's not.  What's that about?  Your mom fucks black guys?  No.  That's fine.  She does.  It's a picture of it.  No.  I've never seen her with a black man.  Why are we bringing his mom in?  That's weird.  I got a rod right now.  I love his mother.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Is there an 80s song that'll make you feel better, Stevie?  Stevie, you've taken a beating today.  Yeah.  You're a big 80s music fan. 
[02:19:00]  I'll be fine.  How about that Huey Lewis one she likes?  I want a new cock.  Stevie, what song will make you feel better right now?  No, I'm good.  I'm fine.  What 80s song?  I don't need a song.  Why don't you give us one so we can do a bit?  Oh, safety dance.  Oh, God.  See, safety.  He just wants to be safe.  He wants to be safe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he wants to dance to his mom.  All right.  Highway to the danger zone.  You like that one, Opie?  No, I don't.  Oh, wow.  What are you getting at?  We're singing it.  We know the song. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, you can just sing it.  I'm your only friend in this room.  That was smart.  You better be careful.  That was smart.  I actually tapped out of your horse shit life.  You'll release the Kraken.  I'm sorry.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  I'm dummy.  What's the youngest guy she's ever brought home, would you say?  Probably the Spanish guy.  He was like early, early 30s.  Early 30s.  Did it bother you that you was fucking a high school shit?  It was like late 20s.  Brock's a Brock.  Oh, fucking A.  He's brilliant. 
[02:20:00]  God damn.  Give him the safety dance.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  So there it is.  Now you can hear it.  So it was him.  And how old is your mom?  52.  52.  She's 52.  She must look good still.  She was banging some early 30s guy.  Hey, look.  It's Tom Green on TV.  What does she look like?  She's, um, no.  She's, like, my height.  And, um, she's, like... 
[02:20:30]  Is she frumpy like you?  Yeah.  No, she's a little...  She's a little skinny.  She's a little skinny.  She's fat and dumpy and doughy and out of shape and fucking a mess.  She's not fat.  She's not fat.  I mean, she's all right, but, you know, like...  Is she aight?  She's aight.  She's, like, love handles.  Yeah, love handles.  She's a little bit, but, like, she can...  You don't notice it that much.  More of the cushion for the pushing?  No, like, no.  It's not...  It's really not...  She's, like, skinny fat.  Does she have a nice ass?  No, I don't look...  I don't...  Well, you know, if you were not her son, would you look at her ass and think she had a good 
[02:21:00]  ass.  Look, Stevie, my mom had nice boobies when I was growing up.  You can notice that they're nice boobies.  Doesn't mean you want to suck on them.  Yeah.  What's your mom's best...  I didn't say that I wanted to...  What's your mom's best feature?  Her ass?  Yeah, what did you say?  Her camel toe?  I don't think of my mom in that way.  It's gross.  What did the young Hispanic man like about your mom?  Was it her...  I don't know.  Did he smack her ass and say that she had... 
[02:21:30]  She had junk in her son's bedroom and she met you?  So you're junk?  Because you're junk.  Because you're junk.  Oh, shit.  What is he doing?  He's got his...  Oh, we're going to get a picture of her?  Yeah.  All right, well...  It'd be funny if she was like, you know...  She was like, it'd fucking...  She had like a...  I'll have...  I'll have...  I'll have...  I'll have... 
[02:22:00]  Or not.  Or not.  Yeah, but...  Play a good two-eyes blind song for him.  Marshall Tucker.  Can't you see?  Can't you see?  Where's the mom picture, Stevie?  You got one in your wallet?  Yeah, come on.  Nah.  I don't carry one in my wallet.  Next to the unused condom.  That dried-up fucking...  Cracker.  Do you carry a condom with you?  No, but I...  No hope, right?  No, I actually have condoms in my bag that I carry here. 
[02:22:30]  In your bag?  Yeah.  Bags in your bag?  But E-Rock gave them to me.  E-Rock gave them to me because it was one of the few days that I actually didn't, like,  screw up, so he gave me, like, a prize.  Why?  You don't use them?  Do you jerk off in them?  What do you do?  No, I just have them.  You never know when you're going to use them, so I keep them around.  No, you know.  You're not.  Well, I can be hopeful.  You've gotten close to getting laid lately?  What?  Not lately, but...  Ever?  You don't...  No.  Your mom?  No.  Terrible.  Of course not. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  How many times did you hear her?  How did you hear her?  How many times did you hear her and the Spanish guy?  You know you've heard.  Come on.  I know you've heard at least once.  No, I never heard them doing anything, like, moaning or anything.  I only heard them, like...  They would be, like, talking, like, in the other room, but, like, nothing...  Did you ever hear him moaning and what sounded like her eating a fruit roll-up?  She refused to do anything if we were in the house.  No, because she knew... 
[02:23:30]  You don't know where she's lying.  She's...  She...  Your mom has had sex in your house.  Stop it.  Okay, well, not when...  Not when we've been around.  How do you know?  She might have...  She's...  How do you know?  Where was the Spanish guy at night?  What, did he leave?  Did he go home at night?  He spent the night, right?  I can't...  Maybe.  So, yes, they went to bed.  They went in the same bedroom.  What do you think they were doing in there?  No.  What do you think they do over there in McDonald's? 
[02:24:00]  Because mom was drinking what looks like a milkshake, I'll tell you that much.  That's my new favorite line from Fargo.  Now I'm going to have to get it.  I know.  McDonald.  Yeah, so...  So, she's had sex while you've been in the house.  Why are you in denial?  Because I don't have anything to prove that.  I don't...  I have never heard anything.  What kind of proof is there?  Can you bring her...  Watching your mom do the fucking tight shuffle walk to the bathroom, so don't trip down her 
[02:24:30]  Here's the proof, which it should have with you.  Oh, where her knees are together, and her little feet are pitter-patting, so the load  doesn't go all over the floor.  And you hear in the bathroom a little, whoops!  She doesn't want her blind son slipping.  Yes, there's the proof.  She brought a young guy home to her house where her blind son lives.  Of course, she fucked him.  Yeah, she fucked him.  Could you bring your mom's sheets in? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, bring the sheets in.  We'll fucking go over it with the black light.  Yeah, could we do that?  Just rip him off the bed.  She's an African-American light.  She can't know about this.  Sophie Kennedy, she's been with black guys.  Yeah.  Can we do that?  Her bed sheets?  No, her clan sheets.  I think I have audio from that afternoon when your mom brought that guy over.  Do you, Danny?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'd love to see him.  Just listen.  I would love to.  Isn't that it? 
[02:25:30]  Did you hear this?  Yeah, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.  This is stupid.  You're going to just drill.  Look up at me, wouldn't it?  Yes, I'm going to make your eyes water.  You bitch.  Give me that.  Isn't that it?  Mom, I got to go to the station now.  I got to go to my internship, Mom.  More.  Mom?  More.  Are you puking?  Are you okay?  It's coming off. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  That's fucking Brandon.  You know who that is?  My buddy, yeah.  Of course he is.  We've had Brandon on.  The hardcore one, right?  That's it.  Yeah, Brandon.  I'm going to go to my internship now.  I know what I'm doing to you.  Do you need Pepto-Bismol?  I need the bathroom for so long. 
[02:26:30]  Sound out of breath, Mommy.  God, he makes a blowjob look like it feels really good.  He's fucking her throat.  That's how the girls get the waterfall bangs, by the way.  From the goo.  The goo.  After a BG.  The goo.  What are you?  All right, we should take a break because we got Huey Lewis around the corner.  All right, let's take a break.  So, Stevie, are you going to bring your mom in on Friday, I guess?  If you guys are okay with that. 
[02:27:00]  Absolutely.  We'd love to meet her.  Can you bring the sheets in, too?  All right.  We'll study the sheets right in front of Mom.  All right.  Make sure she doesn't wash them, though.  Yes.  I bet you we see a little duty stain on her.  A little red.  Just a little duty stain.  She still get that or does she go through menopause?  I think she's had her womanly change.  Womanly change?  I said menopause.  Okay, menopause.  I'm calling a guy.  Yeah.  Come on.  She had a womanly change?  Does it taste any different?  Did she have hot flashes and stuff? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, she was moodier than usual.  Yeah.  Oh, finally, though, that fucking horribly broken baby maker is down for the count.  Thank God it can't do any more damage to this world.  You said you have siblings, right?  Yeah.  Two sisters?  Two sisters.  Well, put one of your sisters in here because I want to see the difference.  All right.  That's a good idea.  Let's look at Facebook.  All right.  I want to see one of your sisters and see what she looks like.  Does she look like you? 
[02:28:00]  Is it on?  It should be.  I don't know.  Facebook is shit these days.  Does she have sight?  No?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  Look how he has to type things in.  I swear.  How you don't get, like, sunburn from the monitor?  Maybe because it's LPD.  Is Huey...  Let me break and come back.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, we could do that.  That's not her.  That's her?  No.  Oh, my God.  I was going to say.  Is Huey...  Did Huey sign in?  No.  I don't think so.  Okay.  We'll look for that.  We'll take a break, then.  I think a...  This should take seconds.  I know, but his eyes are inches away from everything. 
[02:28:30]  You can't find your own sister on...  What are you looking at?  Type her full fucking name in, you shithead.  That's what her name is on it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, everything he does takes forever.  You're infuriating.  What are you doing?  Type her in.  Come on.  What are you doing, Stevie? 
[02:29:00]  Stevie.  Stevie.  What?  What's taking you so long?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  They didn't type their full names in.  They put in, like, a nickname.  Of course they did, so you couldn't find them.  No, I'm friends with them, but they just don't...  They're your sisters.  How many people are you friends with?  Like, almost...  Like, 490.  Like, almost 500.  What's her name?  You don't know your sister's name on Facebook?  Yeah, Jack...  No, they're not saying it.  Say it, don't say it.  Holy mother of pearl.  I know their name, but the way they have it is not the full name, so... 
[02:29:30]  Because Stephen Bajor says I'm blind space.  It's funny.  All right, Huey Lewis next.  Yes.  The Volkan Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  They're bringing Huey Lewis up to the studio. 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  We're going to be talking to Huey Lewis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes!  The great Huey Lewis.  And I learned that Roland is blind.  Yeah.  Wow.  Because there was a black guy walking down the hall.  I don't know his name, and I apologize.  I've never met the guy, but...  And she knows his name?  No.  All of a sudden, I go to...  In person.  All of a sudden, I go to Roland.  Oh, there's Huey Lewis.  And he goes, oh, good.  Right on time. 
[02:30:30]  I'm like, Roland, that's a black guy.  Huey T.  Newton.  Then I turn to the left here.  There's another guy, very small guy, like Travis, walking down the hall.  I go, no, actually, that's him.  Oh, okay, good.  I got him twice within 10 seconds.  With fake Huey Lewis.  One a black guy, and one that looks like Travis.  Huey.  Is this Huey Lewis now?  Open Friday, wide?  Yeah, it's got to be.  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah.  He looks just like Huey Lewis.  What is he, signing autographs as he walks?  Of course he is.  He's still famous?  He's famous.  How can he still be famous? 
[02:31:00]  He's so famous.  What?  Huey is so famous.  He's got a limp, too, man.  He must have a big dick.  What?  Oh, he's got a swagger.  That's not a limp.  That's a swagger.  Yeah, it's a dick strapped to his leg.  You think?  Yeah.  He does have a good swagger.  Look at you, man.  Look at this Huey Lewis.  I know.  Huey's the shit, man.  I'm out of pussy this motherfucker.  I know.  Huey Lewis!  Huey!  Wow.  Good game.  Yeah.  Have a seat.  Make yourself comfortable.  We saw your swagger, sir.  I know.  You've got a swagger when you walk. 
[02:31:30]  You've got a nice swagger.  You've got a swagger.  I try.  He's got that, like, too-cool-for-the-room walk.  I try.  Fantastic.  Huey Lewis.  It's an old swagger, but it's a swagger.  You've got a swagger.  You've got a swagger, my friend.  You do have a swagger.  Yeah.  And, what, you got a new album coming out?  Yeah, I've got a brand new album coming out.  I'm especially excited about it.  Do I seem excited?  You seem excited.  I don't know yet.  We just met you again.  It's our best work.  Best work?  I think so.  And is it Huey Lewis, or will the news be joining you?  No, no.  Huey Lewis and the news.  Ah. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Okay, very cool.  First album in how long?  Nine years.  Nine years.  What took so long?  Uh, well, the...  The mortgage had to be paid.  The fishing was good.  I don't know.  You know.  Yeah.  No, nobody's in a hurry to, you know.  They're not in there.  The world's not waiting for another Huey Lewis and the news record.  You just kicking back and enjoying life for a while?  Yeah.  This one was a labor of love.  We did a tribute, soul music tribute thing.  Loosely based on Stax records.  Okay.  They're not all Stax tunes, but they're all from sort of Memphis. 
[02:32:30]  And we, um, rather than do the obvious ones, you know, No Knock on Wood or Midnight Hour,  we kind of went deeper in the vaults to do a little Johnny Taylor and Eddie Floyd and Solomon  Burke and wrote the stuff we grew up on and just had a ball doing it.  Did it in Memphis.  Recorded it at historic Ardent Studios.  And I must say, you do have the perfect voice for that type of music.  Well...  Huey's got a great voice.  Oh, yeah, you do.  Yeah.  Who else recorded in that studio?  Anyone we would know?  Yeah, I mean...  Like an Elvis or somebody, or...  Well, the Staples thing. 
[02:33:00]  It was an annex.  Elvis Smith.  Elvis Smith.  And Elvis.  No, Ardent's only been...  It was the set of Stax's annex.  It wasn't the Stax studio.  Okay.  But it was built later.  And a lot of the later Stax records are done there.  A lot of Staples Singer stuff.  You know, a lot of, uh, big, big star, the big Memphis band.  Right.  Lots of people.  Also, uh, wow, 25th anniversary of Back to the Future.  Uh, uh, just, uh, uh, is, is happening.  I actually saw the movie.  Me and Danny went down to the movie theater, because they re-released it in theaters, to 
[02:33:30]  see it on the big screen.  Very exciting.  Uh, I, I love the movie.  Have been a big fan for years.  Uh, you, you, you were in there.  Yeah.  You were in there with the megaphone.  Yeah.  Uh, and, uh...  Don't blink.  Don't blink.  I know.  You might miss it, but your music prominently featured.  That's right.  It was.  Uh, did, did you think this, that movie would have this type of longevity?  No clue.  25 years later, still huge.  And, and amazing that they released it to the big screen, as well.  Yeah, yeah.  And, and, uh, the place was packed. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, uh, people laughing at the, there's, there's a picture, there's the still picture.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  One take.  One take.  I nailed it.  You haven't aged.  Oh, my God.  You haven't aged.  Not at all.  I agree with you.  I'm serious.  I look great on radio.  It's just as Huey Lewis.  It's the great Huey Lewis.  It's Huey Lewis.  Yeah, that was, uh, we just did a little, you know, we did the circuit with the old Reunion.  You know, the cast.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was, I didn't really know what to expect, but it was really, really pretty sweet. 
[02:34:30]  It's a beloved movie, as they call it.  It is.  Beloved.  And what's odd is, uh, if, if you watch it now, you notice that, uh, comedies got away  with a lot more back then than they do now with, uh, political correctness and things  like that.  Because there were some moments in that film where you're watching and going like, oh boy.  Nowadays, people would be like, oh, that's racist, or that's, uh, a little edgy, or, you  know, you'd have, you'd, uh, Biff.  You'd have Biff.  There, there'd be school bullying, uh, uh, uh, people that would be like, he's, he's 
[02:35:00]  showing that school bullying is something.  There's definitely, there's three or four special interest groups that would be protesting the  release if Back to the Future was being released as a new movie.  Date Rape was happening.  Oh, of course.  There were racist words being thrown around.  N-A-A-C-P.  Al Sharpton would be in an hour.  Al Sharpton would be all over the place.  It was, uh, but, but, it's looked at as a innocent, uh, beloved comedy that you could  take the kids to.  It's interesting, you know, uh, and it was, uh, for its time, probably just regular, regular 
[02:35:30]  no, but it, it, it's interesting that it's developed these legs somehow, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Not three so much.  Yeah.  Not three.  Are you sick of hearing about that movie at this point?  Like, after 25 years, you're like, all right, it's kind of the past.  Do you get tired of it?  Yeah, not really.  I mean, it's a...  Part of his great career.  Part of his great career, like duets.  No, but he's done a lot of things.  So many things.  Sometimes people get sick of hearing about one thing that they were attached to when  he's done so many.  Well, what's the one thing you get sick of talking about?  Mm.  Not...  As far as your career goes.  Well, I don't really.  How'd you get your name? 
[02:36:00]  You know, the routine questions, but I don't, people don't ask that much.  I'm happy to talk about it.  How, how accurate was Patrick Bateman's assessment of your album?  Did you love that you were...  Honestly, it was really...  His assessment.  Actually, pretty close.  I mean, you know, the guy was obviously a fan.  Yeah.  I read the book when it came out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they said...  And, you know, he...  Not just us, but Phil Collins and Tina Turner.  He gets it right on.  He wrote pretty perceptive reviews.  This is Huey Lewis in the news.  The news.  I've never seen the movie.  I've only read the book. 
[02:36:30]  Why?  The movie's great.  Because the book is so much better.  You can't do it.  I couldn't see the movie either.  I had to protest because they asked us to use the film, to use the song in the film.  And I said, sure, why not?  I was on the road.  I said, you know, William Dafoe's in it.  It's art.  Yeah, no problem.  So they paid us and used the film.  And then on the eve of the release of the movie, they asked, they wanted to release a soundtrack suddenly.  And they asked my manager, well, can we do a soundtrack? 
[02:37:00]  And he called me.  I said, well, what's on the soundtrack?  He said, well, not much.  It's just our song.  I think there's a Phil Collins tune or an Eric Clapton song or something.  And then a bunch of source music.  And we're really probably not fair for our fans to have to buy this record.  Right.  Just for the one time.  So he said, no, thank you.  It wasn't part of the deal originally.  No, thank you.  So on the eve of the release of the movie, their publicity machine sent out a press release to everybody that said, I had seen the movie and it was too violent.  So I'd yank the tune from the soundtrack.  Oh, my God. 
[02:37:30]  Which made for a good copy, I suppose.  Yeah, I guess so.  But it makes you look like a goody two-shoes.  Yes, it certainly does.  Yeah, they never get it right.  Which is not true, of course not.  No, of course not.  It would be great if you had released a statement and said it wasn't violent enough.  I had a certain amount of women I wanted killed or my music doesn't get attached to it.  You guys got to see the movie.  It's a great movie.  I just, the book was so, the book was so graphic and amazingly well written.  It was like, I just, the movie couldn't follow it to me.  I don't think, and I don't, I heard they played, they made Bateman kind of tongue in cheek. 
[02:38:00]  Maybe he was like that, but I didn't see him like that in the book.  I painted, I pictured a real stoic sociopath.  I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to read the book now.  That's great.  I'm going to have to go the other way.  But the Huey stuff is really, it analyzes the album.  It's fantastic.  Absolutely.  On duets, we've heard a lot about Gwyneth Paltrow being kind of difficult, true?  No.  She was good?  She was very professional, really good, and she can sing, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, you guys did a great job with that.  That's actually one of my guilty pleasures, that dumbass song. 
[02:38:30]  What song?  What is it, Cruisin'?  They clearly should have released the song before they released the movie.  Oh, really?  They released them both at the same time.  Did you say no, because there wasn't any women being killed?  He walked out of the premiere, where's the rape scene?  Oh, my God.  No, but I almost had an affair with her, who was my daughter, right?  In the script, that's how I'd meet her.  I'd be attracted to one another.  Really?  Before I know it's my daughter. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  Oh, that's a little racy.  So that's a little racy.  Yeah.  Look at you in that movie, and then Back to the Future, where Michael J. Fox is kissing  his mother in the car.  See?  What's wrong with you?  That's outrageous.  That's twisted.  You're a big baseball fan, right?  Giants, I would assume.  We're very excited.  Think they're going to do this, or what?  Well, I hope so.  I mean, they've got great pitching, obviously.  I mean, Cliff Lee's no slacker, but we'll see.  I mean, you never know.  And fortunately, it turns out baseball is still a team sport. 
[02:39:30]  And Giants are a great story, if you like baseball, because they're doing it with a different  guy every day.  And Bochy's done a great job.  And by the way, they are a very classy organization, the San Francisco Giants.  I mean, we just did the anthem on Wednesday night.  Yeah, you were out there.  Oh, yeah.  And they look after you like 10.  I mean, the food at the ballpark is excellent.  They just do a great job.  Everything's great.  Yeah.  I'm going to get past Cliff Lee, though, man.  Huh?  Got to get past Lee.  Yeah, he's tough. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, let's see.  Let's see.  And I don't like you like it, actually.  Let's see Lee hit.  Well, good point.  That's true.  But here in New York, the Yankee fans spit on his wife, so.  Did they really?  Oh, I don't know how.  You know, look.  That's a big story.  Like I said, it's a compliment.  The guy was pitching so well that they felt compelled to spit on his wife.  How'd they know his wife, though?  Why don't you not wear the Lee jersey?  Lee's wife.  At Yankee Stadium?  Yeah.  I guess they know where the wives sit or something like that.  That's kind of despicable to, uh.  He'll be in Pittsburgh.  I bet for her to show up at the ballpark. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure that will help get him to New York.  Insult to injury.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was bad.  Being a Yankee fan, I wasn't very happy.  I wanted to see a New York, San Francisco, I mean, I'm a Yankee fan.  We did, I'm sure.  That would have been an amazing world.  But just for the historical.  And I'm not a Yankees fan, but that would have been a nice world.  No, no, Josh, we've been in, since they've been in San Francisco, we've been in three  world series and never won one.  So this is, uh.  What are the two?  I know the, oh, the A's series and the earthquake.  What else?  A's.  Oh, shit.  Yankees in 62.  Okay.  And then, uh, the Anaheim Angels here, what, 2002. 
[02:41:00]  Okay.  Yeah, I kind of want to see the Giants win.  And the Rangers just, it's the whole state.  Well, they're both, both teams have never won a world series, right?  Well, I don't think the Rangers have ever been to a world series.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the story there.  I've been saying it's their first time at the dance.  I've been saying that a lot.  Don't say it.  Anybody who will listen, don't ever say that.  You got good tickets for the games?  Uh, well, that's the thing about the anthem, you know, when you do the anthem.  Then they take care of you.  Yeah, they take care of you.  And do it well.  It's a little nerve-wracking, the anthem.  Because it comes back at you, right?  Yeah, it comes back.  It's not easy.  We do an acapella, it's really not easy, but. 
[02:41:30]  You hear what you sang five seconds ago coming back at you.  You're using monitors, ear monitors?  No.  No?  Look at you, old school.  I love it.  Just sing, Huey.  Yeah, exactly.  Why am I yelling?  I don't know.  The whole gig lasts two minutes, you know, and the seats are great.  Are you afraid you're going to forget the words, though?  Like, do you have any fear of that?  Because it's, I don't know, people who know the words have forgotten the words.  Yeah.  That is embarrassing, yeah.  Well, it's nerve-wracking, for sure.  That, and then you've got to start out in a certain, well, you've got a good range, 
[02:42:00]  but you've got to start out at a lower note.  It's a hard song to sing.  Yeah, you get that.  It's probably an English drinking hall.  You know, oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light.  It's where Francis Scott Key apparently swiped the melody.  Oh, really, yeah.  An old English drinking hall.  Oh.  Just over a pint of beer.  Wow.  He's like Led Zeppelin, just stealing songs from everybody.  It's just melodically not fabulous.  But how did the Rock and the Rockets Red Glare?  How did that part get so high? 
[02:42:30]  Because that makes sense, the beat of a...  Yeah, sure.  But how did that get so high?  And the Rockets Red Glare, and I'm bursting in air...  You know, he's like chanted.  So someone should sing it that way.  Isn't it the War of 1812?  Francis Scott Key was like Ray Parker Jr.  That's a good point, though.  The faster you sing it.  I won't bring that up.  The easier it is.  The better it is, really.  The better it is.  What do you do with that one next time?  Well, we do it pretty quick.  Yeah, yeah.  You get through it.  You do more of a, yeah.  It's a cappella.  We do a part doo-wop, part Navy band.  Right, yeah, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  You can't get too...  You need to be sort of traditional, I suppose, but you don't want it to be square.  You and the news, always very good with the harmonies.  That's always been a great part of your music, is the harmonies.  I have a great band, and they all sing great.  They can all sing great.  They all sing great.  You get a band where everyone can sing.  It just sounds so full and great.  Yeah, and it's fun to do.  I mean, we do a cappella stuff in the show, and first started just sort of warming our voices  up backstage, and then started trying this old stuff and put it in.  When you get a bunch of guys singing like that, harmonies, and they're just ringing perfectly 
[02:43:30]  and stuff, no instruments behind it, it really is amazing that you can do that, that you  can even make that happen, you know?  It sounds fantastic.  I love it.  It's really fun.  It's really fun to do.  I would know.  And you don't have to bring...  I harmonize with my brother when we gig.  And you don't have to hear those in the news.  Just like it.  You save money on the road crew as well.  Yes, of course.  Very little equipment to bring.  Anything you have to do to keep the voice from getting all chappy when you're touring? 
[02:44:00]  I'm known for chappy, so that's good.  Yeah, that is true.  I got a gritty voice, but...  It would be a drag if it turned up one day and was crystal clear.  Nice clean voice.  What would I do then?  It's like Geddy Lee.  But yeah, needless to say, we get a lot more sleep than we did in the 80s, and you've  got to look after yourself.  I mean, obviously the lifestyle's different.  You guys are older now.  But were you guys ever really into that partying thing?  Because you weren't known as a partying band.  There weren't stories going out like other bands at the time. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, but we weren't, you know, we weren't...  Choir boys.  Choir boys either.  I mean...  He had a song.  Yeah, I want a new drug.  I mean...  Yeah, but the drug was...  He had to have some partying going on.  Listen to the words.  It wasn't about a drug drug.  It was...  That's how he got on MTV.  It was the feeling of that.  It wasn't...  He wanted a metaphor.  A metaphor.  It's a metaphor.  No, he wanted a new drug.  You didn't listen to the words.  He did it that way to get it on MTV.  He just got no dummy in this room knew the word metaphor.  He was like...  It's a metaphor, you idiots.  Should we bring in Stevie?  Stevie's a big Huey Lewis in the newsroom.  Ah, yes.  Is he really?  One of our interns. 
[02:45:00]  And we asked him to maybe have a question ready for you.  So Stevie's the one with the musical tunes?  Yeah, he's...  Well, he's...  He's a Stevie.  I have a question about...  He's actually an intern.  Don't worry, he's not...  He's not what you think.  He's not as special as you think.  He's not what you think.  He looks it, but...  Hi, Stevie.  He's not the smartest intern we've ever had.  Stevie, how you doing?  He's a big fan...  Hold on, Huey.  He's a big fan of 80s culture, and he...  Dare I say, he jerks off to Cheryl Teagues.  I don't know where that comes from.  This is not a lot of radio, so let's get... 
[02:45:30]  He's probably not the first or the only one.  But he's 19 years old.  How does he discover Cheryl Teagues?  Not even nude pictures.  Like, yeah, pictures of her face and stuff.  I thought we were talking about MTV.  What happened with it?  Wait, that mic's not on.  Hello?  You actually want to get into radio, Stevie?  You're not very articulate.  Can you hear me now?  Yes, we can, Stevie.  No.  Right on my own.  It's the Irish show.  All right.  Yeah.  No.  I thought we were talking about MTV.  What are we talking about me jerking off?  Come on.  No.  Huey Lewis, come on. 
[02:46:00]  Is it really?  Wow.  I'd say he gets very excited.  He's all about 80s culture.  Yeah.  Which is strange for an interview.  Huey Lewis, MTV, jerking off.  Those three things.  What's wrong with...  It's perfect.  It's the 80s.  You just don't hear those three things.  Yeah.  Stay together.  A lot.  I never see that on those retrospectives on VH1.  I love the 80s, and it's just all bunch of people beating off.  The jerk-off bands in the 80s.  You know what his favorite band is?  You'll never guess.  I give a...  It was an 80s band that MTV played to death. 
[02:46:30]  Flock of Seagulls.  You're close.  They did play that a lot.  One of those type of...  Oh, Duran Duran.  Big Country.  That is a good one.  Big Country.  Big Country.  I love them as well.  Yeah, they are good.  They're great.  Why, though?  Because all we know is one song, basically.  Great song, though.  It is a great song.  And good.  Really, really good.  Kind of an original sound.  Very sort of a Highlands-y...  They're Scottish, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was very, very original.  Yeah.  They're Scottish, and you hear that in there.  Regional.  It's kind of real...  Yeah.  Hey, you've got a lot in common.  Why don't you invite him over to have sex with your mom? 
[02:47:00]  No!  Apparently, his mom likes having sex with a lot of guys.  A lot of different people.  I didn't say that.  A lot of different guys of all kind of racial backgrounds and stuff.  Ever since his dad...  I told you about one Spanish guy.  Yes, yes.  And it turns into my mom has done every nationality.  It wasn't one Spanish guy.  It was the entire band Santana.  You misunderstood.  He was a chump.  Stevie, what do you know about Huey Lewis and the news?  Besides, he was in Back to the Future. 
[02:47:30]  We went over that.  I mean, they're a great band.  What's your favorite song?  Yeah, what is your favorite Huey Lewis and the news song?  I'm not going to say The Power of Love, because that's very cliche.  Well, if it is, it is, though.  It's very cliche.  No, but I like a lot of songs.  I like...  I tried that on karaoke.  It's very hard to sing.  It's very high.  Heart and Soul, probably.  Heart and Soul.  Or Heart of Rock and Roll is a good one.  Yeah.  How about If This Is It, or Do It Off My Baby, or Stuck With You, or maybe Perfect World.  Come on!  I was going to say Perfect World.  Oh, gosh, I could just go on and on.  You know a lot of Huey Lewis songs. 
[02:48:00]  How many number ones?  I'm trying to help you, Stevie.  I'm trying to help, man.  There's no helping you.  We're not going to stump Huey.  How many number ones?  Huh?  How many number ones?  I don't know.  So many.  Who counts?  It really is.  Seven or eight.  Fourteen.  No, I'm not.  Huey Lewis and the News is a band of hits.  That's one of the biggest albums of all time.  It's one of the biggest pop albums of all time.  Sports is an amazing record, man.  It's just so many hits.  When you put together an album like that, do you know when you're putting it together,  like, wow, this is just chock full of music people are going to enjoy? 
[02:48:30]  Not really, no.  We produced it ourselves, so clearly we wanted to have at least one that was a hit.  And we knew a couple of them we thought about.  But it just was one of those things.  You know, it all just sort of takes off.  Do you still get checks for that?  Yeah, sure.  Of course.  Nice checks coming in the mailbox.  When you're doing an album like that, and they're playing on TV in heavy rotation, heavy  rotation, do you start to, like, watch what other bands are playing and then go, wait,  that's getting more play than ours.  Like, do you start to see as a newer band is coming in, you start to get annoyed that 
[02:49:00]  you're not getting as many plays?  How does that work when you're watching your videos, no?  I don't think any of that stuff.  I'm sure the record label worries about that sort of stuff.  I just worry about the video.  We wrote them most ourselves, you know.  What we did is our very first video was Do You Believe in Love?  and the label hired a fashion guy to do it.  Uh-oh.  And, you know, he put kind of a pastel backdrop and we had all this makeup on and rouge on  our cheeks.  It's the one where we're in bed with a gal and everything.  So now we go for the big viewing of the new video. 
[02:49:30]  And, I mean, I think it's cringeworthy.  Do you get embarrassed at it now?  Yeah, I think it's awful.  And yet people, everybody loved it and it seemed to work.  So I thought, well, clearly anybody can do this.  So I said, if we're going to do any more of these, we ought to do them ourselves, if  anybody's going to draw this line.  So that's when we started doing the silly ones, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  And basically trying to avoid a literal translation of the song, if at all possible.  Yeah, they were very entertaining.  And just goof off, man.  Do them in San Francisco.  Yeah, they were very popular, yep. 
[02:50:00]  Can we see Do You Believe in Love?  Yeah, now I've got to see that.  Now I want to see.  Do you mind, Huey, or are you going to do it?  No, no.  It's all right.  Do you, uh...  Oh, I forgot about this.  Remember this one?  Yes, now I do remember.  Yeah.  And everything was pastel.  It was a fashion guy.  I wanted it all.  It was all about colors.  God, these commercials they put in these damn videos all the time now.  What is that?  That's a commercial.  They're making money off your video there still.  Yeah, they're putting ads.  Yeah, in front of your stuff.  He was going to have this pulled off of YouTube immediately. 
[02:50:30]  All right, that's very, uh...  Yeah.  This is a good song.  Oh, look it.  Look at the makeup, man.  Wow.  Holy crap.  I look like David Bowie.  You really do have a lot of makeup on.  You just stood up in a room and began singing.  Videos are kind of cool.  And look, he's belting out a song and he's not even waking her up.  What's she doing?  What a drunk.  I need a woman like that.  She's going back to sleep. 
[02:51:00]  Yep.  There's the news.  Look at the rouge on the cheeks.  Yeah, I see it now, Huey.  And the pastels.  All the guys are made up like women.  What are you guys?  Nice.  Who got the girl in the end?  Oh, look at the little romantic look into the camera.  That is adorable.  That is adorable.  Looks like you're singing into a bank cam that you're about to rob.  What is this?  What do you want to wake up?  I don't get the video.  I don't get it either.  Prelude to a gangbang is this.  I never did get it. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  How great is this?  I was getting real close to it.  It's a romantic home invasion.  And then the background.  Now you have to have the live footage.  Look at the cheeks, though.  Look at your cheeks.  The rouge.  That's ridiculous.  You're wearing quite tight pants there, Huey.  I must say.  Yeah, that was a period.  Is that where the legend comes from?  Because we have heard some things.  Yeah.  There is a legend about you out there.  Well, I have an enormous penis.  It's not here with me today. 
[02:52:00]  Might as well get that out there.  That's a great rumor to have, by the way.  It really is.  You have a great publicist.  I've never heard you deny that publicly.  Why would you deny it?  Exactly.  That's a rumor you never want to squash.  You can tell Huey's behind the girl now.  She's going out.  She had a hard time trying to stay asleep.  She was being poked.  There's fucking six guys in bed with her, and she's still sleeping.  I love this.  And to whom?  Great song.  The video really doesn't make sense.  No.  It doesn't make sense. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  The big push away for the sax solo.  Yeah.  That's that good brass sound and everything.  Goddamn.  What a good band.  This is where we said, right about here I said, we're going to do that next video ourselves.  Where you're pushing each other out of the way.  Oh, you're trying to get the attention of the other girl.  The drunk girl.  Yeah.  Who's passed out.  The passed out girl.  Listen to those harmonies.  It's fantastic.  Do you get bored when you're on the road?  Like, you know, you see it took nine years off from an album.  Do you just get, you're just like, fuck, I got to get back to doing it? 
[02:53:00]  Like, what makes you all of a sudden go, it's time to do it?  Well, you only release, we record a lot.  But you only, you know, you make a record to release, so you have to think about the  public before you release a record.  How about iTunes?  Does that change it at all?  Like, were you releasing different now?  It's changed everything.  I mean, you know, you used to have an album where you'd have a few songs that were aimed  at radio on one side.  You got to realize when we grew up, there was no internet.  FM radio was already programmed and top, so it was CHR, Contemporary Radio.  Right, right.  You had to, everybody competed for that one format. 
[02:53:30]  And so, nowadays, of course, you know, it's, it's, it's, yeah, and then there's a, there's  a, there's a market for, it's interesting, you know, we're talking about this, our new  record, Soulsville, which is a Memphis tribute, and a Stacks tribute, and most of the, the  backup band on a lot of the original records, Booker T and the MGs, two black guys and two  white guys who couldn't put their picture on the cover, because the society in Tennessee  was segregated in 62.  Musicians were integrated.  Nowadays, society is integrated, but music is segregated. 
[02:54:00]  You get the, you know, the black over here, and the country over here, and hard rock, there's  a channel for everybody.  And, and, and the same thing in, you know, political discourse, you can, if you're a  right winger, you can watch a bunch of shows where nobody ever disagrees with you.  Right.  And if you're a left winger, same thing, watch a bunch of other shows.  I mean, it's not healthy.  People were just, the nice thing about a Top 40 format was if you wanted to hear a  Huey Lewis and the News song, you also had to hear a Garth Brooks song and a Commodores 
[02:54:30]  or a Stevie Wonder song.  It was all together.  So, yeah, which is great.  God bless Huey Lewis.  Do you notice more music, now that it's available online, do you, are you selling more than you  would if it was just people having to go to record stores and, and buy an album?  Well, here's what happened.  I mean, the value of a piece of recorded music is really going to zero rapidly.  Imagine if somebody wanted to buy Want A New Drug years ago, they have to buy the CD.  Right.  So they pay 12 bucks or whatever it is for the CD and they get Want A New Drug, but they  also get on side two, a bunch of songs that we, that we wanted them to hear that were maybe 
[02:55:00]  more substantive.  They're stretching out a little bit and so on.  Nowadays, they want Want A New Drug, they go to iTunes and buy it.  And by the way, they pay $12 and we get what?  $3 or some percentage of that.  Now they buy it on iTunes.  $0.99 or whatever it is, yeah.  And that, you don't, and they don't get the other stuff.  They only get Want A New Drug and that goes to iTunes.  iTunes gives a portion of that to the record label and the record label gives us, you know,  a dime or $0.10 or $0.20 or whatever it is. 
[02:55:30]  I didn't realize that's kind of getting screwed.  Yeah.  Doesn't it help artists from getting screwed up?  Because you can cut out a lot of the middleman, it seems like, with some of the record companies  now.  I mean, that's an older, like, record, but with newer stuff, doesn't that give the labels  a little less power because you can go right to iTunes and people can get it?  True.  You can go right to iTunes and then you can sell it right on your own website.  You can make it, you know, it's easy to make up CDs and sell them and make a huge profit  on the CD.  But the trouble is, because there's no editing process anymore, it's pretty hard to have a hit. 
[02:56:00]  It's very hard, you know, in the old days, you had to have every station in America playing  your song at the same time.  So, how does that happen without promotion, without some sort of editing process?  But can't you also, oh, shit, I had another iTunes question, too, about cutting.  Oh, can't you make it an album buy-only?  Like, if you want them just to buy your album, you could go, no, no, no, they can't buy,  because some albums are album-only.  I think you probably could.  Yeah, they do do that with some.  I think you probably can do that.  We've got to wrap up, unfortunately. 
[02:56:30]  You've got a lot of stuff to do.  Really?  You've got, what, you've got other stuff to do?  No, we don't.  We don't.  They're saying.  We would love to hang with you.  No, I'm kidding.  Okay, you want out.  Okay.  No, no, I love you.  I like you guys.  We like hanging out with you.  It's not my first time, you know.  It's not my first time.  Yeah, no, there's times where we make believe you have to go.  Yes, you're right.  But in this case, we want you to stay.  The new album's called Soulsville.  Can we play Respect Yourself?  Yeah.  Would that get people, which one do you want us to play?  I don't care.  You play whatever you want to play.  All right.  Respect Yourself has a guest artist on it whose name is Dorothy Morrison.  She's a gospel singer from Oakland. 
[02:57:00]  She wrote and sang Oh Happy Day with the Edwin Hawkins.  And we didn't talk enough about the new album.  Really fast.  Sure.  What is this one more time in, you know, 20, 30 seconds so people go out and buy it?  Well, it's a soul music tribute record.  We cut it in Memphis loosely based on Stax Records.  Most of them were Stax Records.  But not the obvious stuff.  More a little, most of these songs people probably haven't heard of, but there's three or four that they will have heard of.  And they should have heard of these records.  Sorry, Huey.  It's just too darn loud. 
[02:57:30]  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  With that, we'll check out Respect Yourself.  Huey, come back and see us, please.  Appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  Always love having you.  From his new CD, Soulsville.  Check it out.  If you disrespect everybody that you're running to  How in the world do you think anybody's supposed to respect you? 
[02:58:00]  If you don't give a heck about the man with a Bible in his hand  Just get out the way and let the gentleman do his thing  Take the shit off your face, boy, it's a brand new day  You're the kind to know it all, I want everything your way 
[02:58:30]  Take the shit off your face, boy  It's a brand new day  Respect yourself  Respect yourself  Respect yourself  If you don't respect yourself  Ain't nobody gonna give a good go  Respect yourself 
[02:59:00]  If you're walking along and thinking about the world  Oh, you're something cause you're  You're going out the world backwards like you did when you first called him 
[02:59:30]  You keep on talking about the president  He won't stop evolution  No  Put your head on your mouth when you call  That'll help the solution  Oh, you're cursing wrong women  Folk that don't even know their name  No 
[03:00:00]  Then you're dumb enough to think  That'll make you a big old man  Oh  Respect yourself  Ah, yeah  You ought to respect yourself  If you don't respect yourself 
[03:00:30]  Ain't nobody gonna give a good go  Yeah  Respect yourself  Ah, nah, nah, nah  Respect yourself  Yeah, yeah  Respect yourself  Yeah, yeah  Respect yourself  Yeah, yeah  Cause help me to the world  Yeah, yeah  Nobody will respect themselves 
[03:01:00]  You ought to respect yourself  Sirius XM  The virus  Can you give me an example of what you're talking about?  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Hi everyone, this is Huey Lewis  And no matter where I am in America  I tune my XM satellite radio to Opie and Anthony  How great is Huey, man?  He is so cool  He seems to know the show a little bit, too  He was talking to us after the interview 
[03:01:30]  Nice guy, really nice guy  I hope he comes back  You know what he is?  He's cool  He's Fonzie cool  And he can make fun of himself  Of course he can  Thank God  I mean, he made a shitload of money off  Do You Believe in Love?  But he knows that it's kind of a rough video to look back at  Yep  Other guys come in here, you make fun of their project  And they throw a hissy fit  Not Huey Lewis  Not Huey Lewis  No, Huey is also just a cool guy 
[03:02:00]  He was known to be cool back in the 80s  Well, we're playing him to be square  I know  Well, that does make sense  But he was square  But he was hip  And square  At the same time?  At the same time  And one of my favorite lines from Beavis and Butthead  Is this a friend of my dad's?  Well, Huey's one of those guys  I can't even imagine how old he is  He looks exactly the same from when he was on MTV doing all those videos 
[03:02:30]  So he looked old for his age  But now he looks young for his age  Because he never aged from that point  If that makes sense  Total sense  He's still getting pussy, man  Oh, is this the one Beavis and Butthead?  Butthead!  Change it, this sucks  No way  Suffer, dude  Give me that thing, Butthead  Come on, give me the remote  This sucks  This isn't funny, Butthead 
[03:03:00]  Come on  Give me a dollar  That's not funny, Butthead  Come on, it sucks  Okay, Beavis  Don't soil your drawers  Fantastic  Anyone else get fucked when they bought the Beavis and Butthead in real life?  Yeah, exactly  I threw them all in the fucking garbage  Yeah, I went out and got the Mike Judge Collection Volume 1  And then brought it home  Put it in  And I was like, where's the fucking videos?  And they're not there  It's all just the cartoons 
[03:03:30]  I like the cartoons  Don't get me wrong  But them commenting on the videos  Is the only reason I went out and bought that stuff  I think I did the best they could  Oh  What?  I think I did the best they could, I think  Oh, optimistic  Yes, upbeat chip  Upbeat chip  You can get them  So you can  Well, I see you can do it on YouTube  I'm going to watch fucking Beavis and Butthead  Beavis and Butthead all day on YouTube  YouTube videos now  I didn't know it was on YouTube  I had no idea  I have the entire collection  How'd you get it?  I don't know  I don't remember  Can you get me a  I celebrate the entire catalog 
[03:04:00]  It came into my possession  I forget how  Oh yeah, okay  I think I know  Yeah, I think I know it too  No you don't, Chip  I would like a copy  Yeah, is this something that  Oh, you could burn it  Oh no, no  You guys can come over and watch it  But I'm not  I'm not making copies for you guys  Oh, okay  Yeah, don't do that  So someone went out of their way and did that?  That's huge  Yeah  How many episodes are there?  Fucking huge  The entire series  How long is that?  How many videos do they comment on?  Well, it's tough to say  Oh my god, I have no idea 
[03:04:30]  They used to do four in one quick clip  That's a lot  That's a lot  I get that  I gotta check that out  Yeah, guys, come over  Because I got so fucking pissed  When I bought the Beavis and Butthead shit  We're gonna have a peak end  Me and D-Boy  D-Boy  D-Boy  D-Boy  Alright, what else is going on?  Did you want to finish up that  Horseshit Jocktober from yesterday?  Horseshit  The Fugitive  Oh, God  We left a lot of people hanging  When we last left you  iPower 92.1 Interactive Hip Hop and R&B in Richmond, Virginia 
[03:05:00]  We're in the middle of their Fugitive  Fugitive?  How do you say it?  I don't get what  Eh, whatever  Bit  Yeah, they're doing the same bit that we've featured other jocks and shows doing  We should probably wrap it up for the people out there  Yeah  And then tomorrow  I can't wait for tomorrow's Jocktober  I can't fucking wait  Tomorrow is the big one  The New York show  Oh, yeah  Oh  That we feature every year  I think I know who it is  I'm not gonna say  I can't fucking wait  But I think I know  It's the big one  Yeah  Good 
[03:05:30]  New York  Sam, for the people  You're talking heads  Give me a quick setup on this  Well, I was going through stations even in the beginning of the month  And October 1st, actually, Jocktober 1st, somebody stole $5,000 from the commissioner of iPower 92  Who's, there's a commissioner?  What?  That's it  They're wrestling?  They now have commissioners in the radio?  They described him as commissioner of iPower 92  And then, uh, they tried to get to the bottom of it 
[03:06:00]  All of a sudden, a fugitive began calling the radio station, disguising his voice  Theft  You think someone really stole the money, then?  Well, the guy's calling, I would assume  By the way, um, this isn't a repeat of this show  By the way, yeah, don't be fooled  This isn't an Opie and Anthony Best of  It's live right now  I was going to think you went to worst of after you  Yeah, exactly  Yeah  No  We should have  It's just the same  We should have  It's just the same crap that this awful terrestrial radio is pumping out to the listeners 
[03:06:30]  Oh, really?  It could be funny, though  Not as bad as what they're doing on TV right now  That old gag  Out of the, uh, there's definitely a whiff of Rihanna there  In a Halloween costume fashion show  Can you bring some spaghetti and meatball out?  Sure  Who is that fruit?  All right, our third set of models  This is adorable  This would be a great costume for a couple  Absolutely  I, I, you know, Halloween is a good time to be glamorous  That would not be a good couple costume for those two  It's also a good time to be corny  So, uh, manja, manja, manja  You've got your spaghetti 
[03:07:00]  You've got your meatballs  Probably affordable  Cheese spaghetti  It means the pet costume  I'd love to throw them against the wall like my childhood  But, but he's just a black guy  Yeah, that's just really racist  And we want to show you some video of the other costumes that you made  No, he made these costumes?  He sucks  What's his?  Exactly  What is that?  This guy's terrible  I gotta ask you, Simon  What are your Halloween plans?  Well, uh, I'm gonna spend time at Target House  I bet he's gonna be in the village 
[03:07:30]  My parents used to dress up in couples Halloween costumes  No, they didn't  What were some of the couples of, uh, Bonnie?  What was his, every year he was snidely whiplash?  A cuckold  A cuckold  I don't know  Uh, an overbearing mother?  No  Oh  Uh, when we were, I mean, I think it was before I was born even  They went as a cookie and a glass of milk  That's very sexual  What?  It is  The cookie gets dunked in the milk  Get it? 
[03:08:00]  Oh, no  And then a little chip comes out  What's that?  A little chocolate chip comes out  What?  No, chip!  I was talking about  That's how my mother explained it  She said it was like milk and cookies  Yeah, only the milk went all over her face a few times  No, I don't think so  Yeah, can't milk all over your shoes  Get it?  No  So, uh, they went as a couple  Yeah  Like that  And did they have pictures and stuff?  Oh, yeah  They went, they used to go to the neighborhood Halloween parties  What other costumes?  Couples' costumes  Um, I think they went as a king and queen of spades or whatever 
[03:08:30]  Oh, oh, Jesus  Come on  What do you mean?  No, I meant the cards  No reason  I said king of  Yeah, that makes sense, though, with you  Wow, man  I thought you said there were no, uh  I should have said diamonds  But they were the king and queen of spades  I think so  And the mother and father of one  Well, that refers to me  I get it?  Yeah  Alright  When are we looking at your shit?  Yeah, when are we?  Tomorrow, finally  Yeah, whenever you want  Alright, you got your hair still in the office? 
[03:09:00]  Oh, yes  Aw  Bacon and eggs  Bacon and eggs  A fork and a spoon  A fork and a spoon  Who the fuck would go out on Halloween like that as a couple?  And you know it's the girl's idea  Oh, yeah  Why couldn't it be a fork and a light socket?  That's a cut  You know what I mean?  A fork and a light socket  But at least have fun with it  If you're gonna do this horse shit  Well, a kid could see that and get the wrong idea  You know, that's unsafe  Fred and Wilma is a good one  Oh, look at that  It's a socket and a plug 
[03:09:30]  That's a little sexual  The plug is right by his penis  Yeah, I don't like that  A ball and chain  Oh, God  The old ball and chain  Get it?  As long as we keep it in good fun  Yeah, yeah  As long as he's not punching her in the face at the party  Does she have a big silver penis?  Who?  Or is that a guitar?  My mom?  Oh, my goodness  No  That one, yeah  Was that a big silver?  What is that?  A nut and bolt  Oh, a nut and bolt  We get it  Yeah, that's a little too much  Oh, my God  Alright, can we do this, Jack Tober?
