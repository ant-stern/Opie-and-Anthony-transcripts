<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a post-mortem of their disastrous live Halloween show from the Hard Rock Cafe.  The broadcast was plagued by terrible sound quality, described as "tinny" and lacking bass, rendering the show nearly unintelligible.  The hosts profusely apologized to listeners and the bands who performed, blaming inadequate technical support and vowing to never again do a live broadcast from an event.  They recounted the extremely inebriated state of the staff and attendees, including numerous “hammered” interns, detailing incidents of excessive affection, kissing, and groping, with specific anecdotes involving interns Pete and Paul.  Opie even vomited in his backpack on the train home.  The hosts highlighted numerous photos from the party depicting the debauchery, including one of Opie kissing an intern and another of a host embracing a staff member.  Opie's birthday was briefly mentioned, along with a conclusion to Jim Norton's "bid."  Upcoming segments featuring Rob Bartlett from the Imus show and "Stalker Patty" from Maury Povich were previewed.  Fez's confrontation with Opie over Pete's name was also mentioned.  Listener calls offered a mix of agreement and amusement regarding the disastrous broadcast.


The show continued with a discussion of upcoming meetings, including one with an "arch enemy," and complaints about their agent's lack of communication and TV deal negotiations.  This segued into graphic descriptions of female anatomy and promotion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" (WoW) stickers.  A listener call questioning listener count discrepancies resulted in the caller being banned by Opie.  Opie's brother, Elmo, joined the show, relating his Halloween LARPing experience.  This transitioned into a sexually explicit account of a diner encounter involving Elmo, Jimmy Norton's exposed genitals, and a woman Jimmy interacted with, followed by an analysis of Jimmy's dating strategies.  Clips from Maury Povich featuring "Stalker Patty," a 50-year-old virgin Opie fan, were played, followed by heavy criticism and mockery of Patty and her friend Joyce, focusing on Patty's appearance, dating aspirations (Bill Wyman being her ideal date), and the show's makeover.


The segment then shifted to home security concerns, prompted by recent break-ins.  Anthony detailed his shotgun, Remington, and consideration of an AR-15, along with his night vision goggles, while Opie shared a frightening intruder encounter.  They discussed security measures, including alarms and reinforced doors.  A Rob Bartlett commercial for their show on Imus in the Morning and a segment about a fake firefighter/rapist were mentioned.  Opie further described his anxiety about strangers in apartment stairwells, particularly when the elevator was out of service, and his coping mechanism of loud singing/yelling.  The fake firefighter story involved a man who set small fires, then, disguised as a firefighter, sexually assaulted a woman.  Amy, a caller, added disturbing details about the perpetrator's post-assault behavior in the victim's apartment.


The show then focused on the "Assault on the Media" contest results.  The announcement was chaotic, with confusion and misordering of winners. Several entries were played and discussed, culminating in a heated argument regarding the judging process, accusations of interns (including Than) not watching all submissions, and calls for a revote.  A listener email criticized the interns' voting practices.  Sonny Farrelly, a repeat winner (sharing a previous prize with "Boston Strangler"), was ultimately declared the winner after a revote.  Brother Joe, their drummer, called in, detailing problems with a recent live performance due to his alcoholism, leading to a discussion of his potential firing.  An in-studio interview with the Hanson brothers followed, covering their musical influences, current music scene opinions (finding modern rock, R&B, and hip-hop formulaic), and anecdotes about their career, including a radio station ban for profanity and a near-miss encounter with Michael Jackson.  Listener calls, often prank calls or featuring unbelievable stories, were interspersed with humorous and vulgar banter, including discussions about Hanson's public image and Family Guy references.  Ramone provided numerous interjections.  The segment concluded with more calls, vulgar exchanges, mention of Hanson's new album "Live and Electric," apologies to Ron & Fez, and a mention of Rob Bartlett leading the November "Assault on the Media" contest.  Jimmy Norton and Steve were present throughout much of the broadcast.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here. 
[00:05:00]  The medication's on work.  I've been here for seven years.  You're just a tool.  You can keep your hands off of my mule.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony.  You know that?  That's right.  You're a big, fat phony. 
[00:05:30]  I thought you were going for one more.  So did I.  Looking around and said, fuck it.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Hi.  The week's almost over for us.  Wow, thank goodness.  Tough work week.  Really awful.  Oh, my God.  Where do we begin today?  I can barely talk.  And my voice is still all crackly.  My voice is just starting to come back.  Yeah, yesterday I had nothing. 
[00:06:00]  I couldn't even speak.  I guess we got to back up.  Monday we did a fine live show on the radio.  Yes.  And then went to the Hard Rock Cafe for our huge Halloween party.  Want to thank everyone that showed up.  Want to thank the bands for showing up.  It was a great, great time.  Had a blast.  It was an absolute pisser.  But the live broadcast absolutely blew.  Stunk on ice.  Yesterday we just got to kind of wander around all day going, Jesus, this is why we didn't want to broadcast. 
[00:06:30]  We had major discussions behind the scenes saying, you know, we don't want to broadcast.  We don't want to broadcast.  It never works.  I've been on radio a very long time.  That was the worst live broadcast I've ever been associated with.  Oh, absolutely.  I my-fied it.  Holy shit.  Worse than day two.  Holy shit on ice.  Worse than day two, Boston.  Holy shit, yes. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  I-I-I-yes.  Going all the way back to my BAB days when I had a broadcast from gas stations.  Whoa.  And do beach reports at Robert Moses.  Giving the beach report.  Telling all the surfers how-how high the waves were.  Yes, going back that far.  We've always said, uh, the live broadcast, um, from the live event, not a good thing.  And we used to have to do it.  You know, they would say, uh, you guys got to do this because we're your boss and you got to do it.  But now it's like, we've said it so many times that I-I don't know how it happened again. 
[00:07:30]  We-we-we throw a great party.  We have a lot of fun.  Or we can go to some place and do a remote broadcast, but not in front of, you know, a crowd with a party going on.  Right.  But never-never the two.  Well, it's two different things, obviously.  When you're trying to do just a radio show, you have to paint the pictures.  You really have to paint the pictures.  Like, look at the live broadcast, for example, we were having the costume contest, and all of a sudden we're like, wow, little Connor Peterson. 
[00:08:00]  A guy dressed up as little Connor Peterson.  Yeah.  We don't have time, because we're in the middle of five, six hundred people, to explain to the radio audience why this guy looks so good as little Connor Peterson.  It's a visual that everyone is immediately getting at the venue.  Yep.  But you don't have time to explain to the six hundred thousand plus listeners that are listening in to this disaster.  I would try to explain it, and then the live crowd is like, oh, he's explaining what they're looking at. 
[00:08:30]  I could see it here.  Right.  They don't understand that we have to try to do both things.  Right.  We have to be the emcees at this party, and, you know, the feedback on the actual party, everyone there had a great, great time.  Great time.  Had an unbelievable time.  Yeah.  Thought it was one of our best parties.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Great party.  Right.  But then, you've got to get the feedback from the people that couldn't make it, that were listening in, because they're huge fans of the show from all over the country.  And they were embarrassed, too. 
[00:09:00]  They were like, holy shit.  Dude, it sucked.  The sound stunk.  We couldn't hear you.  Everyone was drunk.  Blah, blah, blah.  I want to apologize to the bands we had there.  We can't replay your broadcast.  Oh, my God.  You can't.  What was it?  Like, you heard No Bottom End, but everything was tinny, vocals way in the back.  Way in the back.  You'd hear, like, one guitar.  Right.  That was pretty much it.  Right.  I don't know.  So, we should have been celebrating, you know, our first anniversary and celebrating today that we had a great, great party. 
[00:09:30]  You know?  But, we got this hanging over our heads.  The broadcast stunk.  Yeah.  And we don't have the right people around us that, you know, can make this happen.  So, until we do, we're not doing any more live broadcast.  Stop trying to talk us into it.  It ain't happening.  No, we didn't want to do them.  We don't do them.  So, we won't do them.  The obvious shit.  Anthony and I are on stage, right?  We're three or four feet away from each other. 
[00:10:00]  We still can't hear each other.  I couldn't hear anything.  So, when I was re-listening to the Halloween party on the MIFI, you and I are just talking over each other.  We're having two completely different conversations going on.  Oh, boy.  You're talking about one thing.  I'm talking about another.  Oh, jeez.  We're not syncing up because we can't hear each other.  You know, this is just basic broadcasting.  This is the shit you got to, like, figure out way, way, way before we hit the stage.  Oh.  Oh.  We don't have the right people around us to pull off a live broadcast.  It's as simple as that. 
[00:10:30]  We just don't.  Yeah.  We don't.  The presentation at the Hard Rock Cafe was absolutely great.  It was unbelievable.  It really was.  It was set up perfectly.  But as far as trying to take all that and throw it on the radio for everybody else around the country, we don't have it yet.  We stink.  It's a bit of a problem.  We absolutely stink.  I didn't get to listen back to it.  Don't.  I don't know why you did.  Don't.  Don't.  I just walked around all day.  I just read a few posts that were like, oh, man, fuck, it sounded like shit. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, okay.  It didn't even sound good in a bad way, you know what I mean?  Because, like, running this channel and being on 24 hours a day on 202, it would be kind of cool to do some kind of, you know, wacky things.  Like, people know we do these road shows, right?  Yeah.  So to have a listen on what it's all about could be fun if the listener understands that it's not us trying to have a polished broadcast.  Yeah, we've always talked about the fact that we can, you know, open up the channel and just throw some stuff on there for the hell of it. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  You know, during the night and see what happens.  But it wasn't even good for that.  No?  No.  Really?  No.  No.  It was horrendous.  And I heard Ron and Fez had a real fun time doing the broadcast.  Well, dude.  I feel bad for them, too, you know?  They had a struggle to do a broadcast from that event.  Earl, I think, killed himself.  I think Earl committed suicide. 
[00:12:00]  Earl, who's Ron and Fez's producer, yeah, he was back here running the board.  Yeah.  So, you know, props to Ron and Fez.  They did the best they could, without a doubt.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  But it just, oh my God, it was embarrassing.  I swear to God.  Really?  Yeah.  That good?  I still have it on my MyFile.  Bring it in tomorrow if you want to listen, Ant.  Nah.  We can play a few clips today.  Uh-oh.  Derek's like, don't do this to yourselves.  Derek's like, don't do it.  Ben and Steve are in the other studio trying to find some clips to play today. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  There were some stars, uh, there were some stars backstage, though, I gotta tell ya.  Some stars.  Uh, a couple of interns, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Bill, we know, could hold his booze.  A couple interns.  The whole staff was fuckin' hammered.  Everybody pretty trash.  Fuckin' hammered, man.  Pretty goddamn trash.  Oh, I, if one more guy came up to me and said he loved me, I just, one more, and I was 
[00:13:00]  ready to, I was, I was gonna punch somebody.  Well, yeah, they were, they were all, uh, drinking heavily.  Why as a grown man do I have to have guys come up to me and say they love me?  Who was kissing everybody?  Look at ya.  Pete.  It's just an awkward thing.  It's like, I love you, man.  Here's the worst one of the lot.  Who said they love you?  Here's the worst one of the lot. 
[00:13:30]  Look around.  Who didn't?  Oh, dude.  Who knew that this guy had it in him?  Who knew?  Like, like, Bill, I figured, and Bill was trash.  Bill, the intern?  Right.  Was just snotted drunk and he's chugging jacks like, uh, like, like, it was the last drink  he was ever gonna have.  I expected that from him.  And he just gets all quiet and everything.  This guy.  Talk about, you know, Paul, the guy, Ron and Fez's intern that I had a little problem with, 
[00:14:00]  a little issue.  Yeah.  With him being a little, you know, hands-on, a little like, uh, uh, talky, chatty, Kathy,  shut the fuck up.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you are treading dreadfully close to that area.  Yeah, I pulled a poly.  You, he, he, he got wasted and he was going around just telling everybody.  He comes up to me, he's like, you don't understand, man.  I fucking just love working with you.  You're like my hero.  Oh, and this, and I was just standing there like, I should fucking stab this guy right 
[00:14:30]  now.  I should just stab him.  He said it to everybody.  He told me he was honored to get my breakfast.  Yeah.  He said that?  Honored to get my breakfast.  And it wasn't a joke, like, you know, dude, I'm honored to get your breakfast because  that's kind of funny.  Yeah.  He was serious about it.  Yeah.  Seriously honored to get your breakfast and you, you were really like, were trashed.  Well, I mean, I, I did have a great fucking time.  Yeah.  Well, that was obvious.  I hope so.  Why don't you say the same stuff to us live on the air? 
[00:15:00]  I, you know, my, my best recollections was Than just telling me, punch out, man.  Just punch out.  Get out of here.  Than was the voice of reason.  Than was trying to help him.  He really was.  He's like, just shut the fuck up and leave right now.  He was giving him a good talking to right there.  He was whispering.  And of course, Jim was absolutely going against me and telling, wait, you had something more  to say, Pete?  What's up?  But you don't know.  That was it.  Because Anthony's standing there and Pete's just yapping at him and Than is trying to  get him out of there.  And I'm like, dude, what are you trying to say? 
[00:15:30]  Anthony's right here.  You can tell him.  He's right here.  Don't be afraid.  Than, just tell him.  Look, leave.  You're fucking this up really badly.  Just leave.  And Jimmy's, no, no, tell him.  Tell him he's right here.  But go ahead.  I think this is a good opportunity.  He needs to hear it.  It's fine.  There's one of the great pictures that are up on, I guess, Foundry Music.  Who is that?  Why are you kissing?  Wow, that's me?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's you kissing a guy.  I have no recollection.  And that guy is Bill.  That's Bill, right?  Bill looks horrified.  Bill didn't remember that. 
[00:16:00]  He just went, holy shit, that's me.  You're grabbing, you're like cupping his chin with your hand.  Wait a minute.  Bill, you don't remember being kissed by a guy?  No.  And you don't remember kissing a guy?  That's my recollection.  I remember, actually, did you set that up with your best friend Aaron?  No, I don't know.  You know Aaron?  Aaron.  Big ass member?  Yeah, from the board.  Sure.  Him and him became really close after that.  I don't doubt it.  He was close with everybody, weren't you?  Bobby, the Ron and Fez intern, and I were just working the whole time until, like, 10.  Uh-huh.  And he kept coming in periodically, and he was like, you guys, you suck, I'm having so much 
[00:16:30]  fun.  And then, like, he was, or whatever he was saying.  He kept trying to bring us drinks and stuff, and Bobby and I were, like, stressed out because  people were trying to steal the VIP passes and stuff.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You guys were asking me to bring you drinks.  Oh, eventually.  Eventually.  Yeah, but we didn't even start drinking until after 10.  Yeah, and you had a lot of catching up to do.  I did.  And you caught up, Bill.  You caught up in, like, three seconds.  You caught up fast.  Well, after Don or someone, who was one of the people, practically forced us to go to 
[00:17:00]  the bar, it was Jaeger girl, Jaeger, Jaeger, whatever Ben got me.  That was definitely the downfall.  Who told you to go to the bar?  Well, they were like, hey, have a good time.  Take off, because they wanted us to stop doing it.  So glad everyone thought that everything was completely under control at the Hard Rock  to make sure everyone got nice and snotted.  That girl coming around with the tray of Jaeger, that's what put every single person involved  over the edge. 
[00:17:30]  And everybody's nodding now.  Yeah, yeah.  She kept coming around.  It's like, and it's so hard to turn down a shot of Jaeger when it's just right there  on that tray in front of you.  Because with Jack and Coke, I can take six of those and still be able to get myself home,  you know?  Uh-huh.  But it was the shots and the shots.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't the six-jack and Coke.  The Jaeger does it, man.  It was actually the shots that did it to you.  Did anybody puke?  I sure did.  Did you really?  In my backpack on the train.  You did?  In your backpack? 
[00:18:00]  Well, I didn't want to get it all over the floor.  It was a full train.  Hey, you're thinking.  That's nice.  That was nice.  That's really good.  That's nice that you were looking out for everybody else.  Holy shit.  I do my best.  Is it true that you had some words with Fez?  What happened there?  Yeah, I heard him talking about that on the air.  I had no recollection.  I was talking to a big-ass member.  He's like, yeah, you did that.  You definitely did that.  What happened?  I have no idea.  Apparently, yeah, Fez was talking on air yesterday about how Pete was saying, oh, you don't know  me.  I'm Pete the intern.  You don't know my name. 
[00:18:30]  And he was pointing to his badge, which just says, you know, OA, all access.  It didn't have his name on it.  And he's like, you don't even know my name.  It's right here.  I'm Pete the intern pointing to this.  Oh, my God.  What an ass.  I love it.  Oh, and another thing, when Bobby and I were working and sober, he came up and he's like,  they love you so much.  Oh, boy.  And then Aaron's trying to offer me $200 for a VIP pass.  And I'm like, no. 
[00:19:00]  You didn't take it?  What's wrong with you?  He only wanted it for collecting purposes.  He didn't want it to actually get it.  It was like a 10.  Ah, yes.  Collecting.  I'm like, no, I can't.  It's in a pristine state.  Look at this.  I'm like, I don't know.  But he was on the other side saying that.  It was just like the biggest clusterfell.  Like, at that station I was at.  Yeah, it was, I don't know.  It was a mess down there.  Were you mad that Fez didn't know your name?  I guess.  Apparently he was.  And was it obnoxious?  Like, you don't know my name.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[00:19:30]  That's what I heard.  From Fez.  And he was, you know, the way too close talking guy, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember him.  Wow.  I remember Pete trying to bond with Ant by saying they're fellow LARPers.  Oh, yeah.  He was saying I was a LARPer.  Because I was just dressed up in, like, Renaissance attire.  I've been there.  He's a real LARPer and stuff.  You know, I keep it to the monitor, the computer monitor.  I've never been out in the woods hitting my friends with fake swords.  I trip over his LARPing weapons every morning trying to get ready for this stupid radio show. 
[00:20:00]  This thing's getting fucking thrown out if I trip over it one more fucking time.  I threw something out.  Whose is this?  And then someone goes, oh, it's Pete.  And, oh, he goes, oh, who the fuck is Pete?  There it is.  This is one of his LARPing weapons right here.  I was going to bring it home, but Travis wanted to keep it.  It's that.  It's labeled Pete's LARP thing.  What is this, Pete?  Some kind of club?  That is a mace.  It is a mace.  Yes.  And it's covered in duct tape and decorated with some tribal stuff you do with a Sharpie.  And I guess you hit each other with this. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  And, like, I would get some points.  Yeah, you'd yell two damage.  Two damage right there.  What about that?  Two damage.  What if I crack over your fucking head?  That would be a foul.  A foul?  There's no foul?  What the fuck?  There's no fouls.  I guess there are fouls in LARPing.  A bunch of pussies that you guys are.  Yeah, they are a bunch of pussies.  Shove it up your ass.  Fucking LARPers.  Two damage.  I can't even look at you when I'm looking at you.  I can't look at those two things together.  That's awful. 
[00:21:00]  I know.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island, faithful listener of the fine program.  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Great party.  First call on Monday.  All right, hold on a minute.  This is what we're going to do today.  You were at the event, right?  Yes, I was.  All right, so it was a great party.  I will go on record and say that was one of our better parties.  Yes.  Yep.  Yeah, my friend Nick was little Connor.  We all went together.  Ah.  We also want people to call up today and comment about the broadcast.  And you'll see how different the two are.  But go ahead there, Rob. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, no, I just wanted to call and say I had a great time.  And guys, just keep up the good work, man.  Oh, and Anthony, you wouldn't have looked any more manlier if you were wearing, like,  a robe and slippers.  The costume is very gay.  I look fantastic.  Well, Anthony was brave enough to wear a costume.  Yeah, no.  I don't know.  Got to give him a little credit.  He was a friend.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, my friend.  You said you came with Lil' Connor?  Yeah.  That's your friend you came there with?  You're calling me gay?  That guy was fucking naked, my friend.  He was wearing a diaper.  Wearing a diaper. 
[00:22:00]  Don't be talking about me.  I look manly.  Hey, didn't he win second place in the costume contest, though?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Okay, man.  Punch it out, guys.  Bye.  He would have won if he was a chick.  It always comes down to, if you're a chick, you win.  That's it.  Chicks win those things.  Stop it.  Whiffle Batgirl won the costume contest.  There's pictures up on foundrymusic.com, opieandanthony.com, whackbag.com.  I've already seen well over a thousand pictures from the event.  Yeah, it's amazing.  What a rack. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, a lot of flashing at the event, so that was great for everybody as well.  Wunderbar.  Yes.  And at one point, we lost Jimmy for like an hour, hour and a half, and you come back  on stage, and you didn't even realize we were broadcasting?  All night, I didn't know you were broadcasting.  I had no idea this was going out on the air.  That's typical.  And I was on stage, but with you when you first went out, I had no idea this was being  broadcast.  No?  Nah.  This is the organization we have.  Isn't it great?  I just didn't know. 
[00:23:00]  I'm just completely happy today.  Also, Ron.  One of the main guys on the show had no clue we were broadcasting.  No clue we were broadcasting.  I'm not blaming you.  No, I really didn't know.  Also, I'm like, where the fuck is Jimmy?  He disappeared for like an hour, hour and a half, and then he comes back, and I go, dude,  what are you doing?  We're broadcasting.  He goes, we're broadcasting?  I'm like, yeah, we're fucking broadcasting.  I had no idea.  I know it sounds like shit, but we're still at least trying.  I thought Ron and Fez did like a short period of time, and I didn't hear anything else about  it, so I'm like, oh, okay, it was just a quick little, like maybe an hour to broadcast  or whatever. 
[00:23:30]  The whole thing was broadcasting.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Also, Ron and Fez didn't know it was live, either.  Oh, really?  They had no idea that they were live.  They were told that it was going to be replayed and cut up the...  Well, really?  Yeah, they had no idea, and I think they were really mad about that.  Well, someday people will listen to us.  I mean, what you do is you do the live party, you record the whole thing, then we come back,  and our boys spend the whole night getting the really good clips, and then we look like  superstars, because you don't have to listen to all the crap.  That's how radio has always, always worked. 
[00:24:00]  But for some reason, we had to broadcast.  Holy shit.  All right, let's say hi to Mike in New Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Great party the other night.  I listened to it on the radio.  I thought it came out pretty good.  The band, like you said, it sounded a little tinny, a little off, but understanding that  it was live, I thought it was good.  I thought you guys did a really good job.  Congratulations.  Oh, all right.  Well, that'll make us feel a little better today. 
[00:24:30]  Take care, guys.  All right.  Derek heard the bands.  Derek, what do you have to say about the broadcast of the bands?  Well, pretty much.  What the...  Fucking A.  Wow.  Yeah.  Like that?  Was that your example?  Because that was pretty good.  Mumbling idiot.  He sounds like Reagan on the stand.  All right.  I will.  The mix was awful for most of the stuff. 
[00:25:00]  The guitars were loud in some areas.  Sometimes you couldn't hear the singer.  Drum sounded just like it was overheads only.  Overheads only.  That's what you want to hear.  There was no bass.  Yeah.  Some of them.  Yikes.  Yeah, it was a mess.  And why was Travis hugging you?  Because now I'm seeing a picture of Travis hugging you.  Where?  I don't know.  And you're not happy about it.  They were all hammered.  It was great.  Look, turn this around.  What is wrong with our staff?  They're hugging and kissing each other?  I didn't want to be kissed. 
[00:25:30]  I want to point that out.  Well, you got kissed by Pete.  Yeah.  And now we got a picture of Travis hugging Derek.  You don't remember that, Derek?  No, not really.  You don't remember that?  Oh, my God.  Sean from Vegas didn't like the show.  He says, but, Ant, you're fucking hilarious when you're hammered.  More Anthony sloshed, more gooder.  I was actually keeping my drinking in somewhat of control.  I was actually telling the Jaeger girl, I'll only have half a shot. 
[00:26:00]  But come back twice as often.  She did.  Steve was, you could tell Steve might have been a little close to blackout.  What Steve does when he gets drunk is he stands perfectly straight, but his head wobbles a little bit.  He's like a fucking Hepburn.  You can see he's fighting the urge just to collapse on the floor.  He's perfectly erect.  Just his head.  Oh, that's great.  It's so true.  I noticed that, too. 
[00:26:30]  No, I'm doing, I'm perfectly fine.  There's like a discoloration in his face.  My Steve Bobblehead doll.  Available.  On Foundry Music.  Did you try to kiss him, too?  Ricky Linderman?  Did you?  Probably.  Let's go to Jerry in Connecticut.  Hey, dude.  Hey, Jerry.  What's up?  Dude, that show Monday was fucking awful.  Ah, there we go.  Fucking atrocious.  I turned it off after like an hour.  I couldn't listen anymore.  I swear to God.  You lasted an hour?  I did.  I heard Live Wire and I heard the Rush Tribute Band. 
[00:27:00]  Fucking terrible.  Well, these bands live were unbelievable.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  You knew they had potential, but at some point I didn't even think like in the Rush Tribute Band.  I'm like, the guy's not even playing bass.  I couldn't hear it.  Yeah, and that's a pretty important part.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In Tom's story, I'm like, I don't hear the bass.  Right.  Really bad.  Really, really bad.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  Thanks, man.  And someone was commenting that, it's like, I think I saw Anthony petting a horse outside. 
[00:27:30]  I was like, it was a horse.  He came up on the sidewalk.  In New York City?  Yeah.  Was it a cop?  No, he had a little wagon with him, you know, one of those horse-drawn carriages.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he came up on the sidewalk, and I just was walking back into the bar, and I just kind  of, like, scratched his little nose.  And someone had it, like, as if I was there.  He's like, hey, you want to be Georgie?  Because I have complete recollection of that.  Another shot of Jaguar would have had that little LARPing outfit off. 
[00:28:00]  We could have had you had the horse propped up like that video we saw.  Giving you good intestinal cleaning.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Dan.  What's up, Dan?  Dan.  Hey.  We're losing you, Dan.  Try to call back.  We'll go to Joe the trucker.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, guys.  I was at a truck stop, drinking a six-pack of beer, listening to your shit. 
[00:28:30]  I thought it was so damn good, I wouldn't even let the lot losers interrupt me.  Oh, see, maybe you had to be drunk, driving.  So you enjoyed it?  No, no, no, not driving.  I was sitting at the truck stop.  Oh, very good.  I was playing it on the roadie, so a bunch of other drivers, we had it all on the same  station.  We're all just blast.  I mean, we just had a blast.  Well, maybe it was fun to just listen in to the train wreck.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's just like looking at a car wreck.  You know, you just got to look at it.  Right.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  I'll punch it out.  Thank you, Joe.  Harry in Illinois.  Harry?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you know, I really didn't expect it to be much better when you guys are at a live  broadcast, the fact that a lot of us can't be there, just the fact we got to listen in.  You know, the music was a little bad.  I'll agree with that, but just the fact we got to listen in was good enough for me.  Well, that's what's frustrating to me.  I mean, we didn't cover the basics, really.  I mean, the band should have sounded great on the radio.  There's no reason why they should have sounded as bad as they did. 
[00:29:30]  None whatsoever.  Anthony and I should have been able to hear each other on stage.  Just this dumb stuff that should have been taken care of in the broadcast would have been  a lot better.  Right.  A lot better.  Well, as a listener point of view, though, it's better to listen to that but not listen  at all.  All right.  All right, Joe.  Thank you, Harry.  I appreciate it.  Yep.  Let's go to that.  We'll take just a couple more here.  John in Utah.  John?  Hey, dude.  Hey.  Yeah, you guys sounded really good, but the bands were just bad, especially ACDC. 
[00:30:00]  I gave up and crashed, and I was in Vegas.  And the band.  Wow.  And live, they sounded great.  Yeah, people were losing their minds.  Losing their minds.  I was looking forward to listening to Anthony's brother's band, and yeah, I got just discouraged.  Yeah.  The bands all sounded like crap live.  I mean, on the air live, they were great, though.  Right.  All right, John.  Happy birthday, Ope.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's the end of the bid right there. 
[00:30:30]  Someone finally blew it.  Oh, well.  Why?  It's your birthday.  Happy birthday, Ope.  No, the Jim Norton bid is now over.  It's too bad.  Like how they all sang happy birthday to you last night.  Nice.  A whole room full of people.  Monday.  Two nights ago.  Yeah.  Oh, was it?  Maybe it was last night because Bill is still wearing the wristband.  Yeah.  Do you guys trust us?  Yeah.  Bill is still wearing the wristband.  Anthony gave up on yesterday.  Yeah, I gave up on yesterday.  So, to you, this is Tuesday, right?  I was in a hotel room, locked in, just watching movies, not talking.  I couldn't even talk. 
[00:31:00]  It was so hard to hear anything.  And like Ope was saying earlier, that's pretty important, is to be able to sit there and hear  the people you're broadcasting with.  Right.  Oh, is my dentist here?  That's your dentist?  Is that who it was?  That's not your dentist, is it?  That was the guy that did my root canal.  Not my dentist.  He did my root canal, though.  Him?  Yeah.  Looks like my massage therapist.  If you recall.  I told him he could come up.  I saw him on the street the day before yesterday, before the party, because, if you remember, 
[00:31:30]  he was here once before, but he left in complete horror because you and Jimmy started going  at each other.  Oh, he came that day?  Yeah.  He was like, I'm a big fan of the show.  I'd like to just sit and watch.  I'm like, okay, cool.  Come down.  We have fun.  He finally gets to see the show, and it's me sitting there going, oh, shit.  Oh, you two going at each other.  He just fled the building.  Is he upstairs?  Is he upstairs?  Not next door, upstairs.  He's not the guy upstairs. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, okay.  Because I actually needed, I had a tooth pain recently.  It's funny.  I thought I was like, man, I'll come in and work in.  Yeah, it was bad.  Maybe you can work a deal when you go outside.  Yeah, we'll see what happens.  All right.  A couple of men.  Welcome to the show, sir.  Hi, fella.  Watch through the glass.  Yeah, let's see how to dug out Doug.  Hey, Doug.  No?  What did I do wrong?  Hit the button.  Uh, Doug.  What's going on, fellas?  Hi, Doug.  What's up, Doug?  When I got home at about 7 o'clock in the morning, I checked out the listening thread for the show,  and I couldn't believe the bashing the bands were getting. 
[00:32:30]  They were scary, like the legitimate bands in person.  It was scary how good those guys were.  That's what's frustrating, because, you know, they shouldn't have got bashed.  But I guess the mixing of the bands was just awful, because people in the place were losing their minds.  Like, the Rush band, the people were like, holy crap, that's Rush.  Yeah, they were, uh, you couldn't even tell.  They were that good, and 2U was phenomenal.  They brought the house down at the end of the show.  Hell yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  But if you go to the listening thread on Whackbag, they just destroyed the whole live broadcast.  Ouch.  Completely destroyed it.  And, you know, well, they should.  It was, uh, bad on the air.  Most of those pricks are just looking for any bad, you know, anything that's bad about the show,  and then just blow it up out of proportion, so.  Doug, by the way.  Doug?  Yes.  Yeah, and thank you for showing that hiney off.  Wow.  Yeah, that's mine.  Is that your chick's?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get to touch that. 
[00:33:30]  I guess that's fantastic.  Yeah, her ass is up on all the websites today for everyone else to enjoy.  Let me see it, Hulk.  Great picture on Whackbag.  I got to touch that on somebody else's hotel room bed, too, so that was great.  Very nice.  Very good.  All right, Doug.  And, uh, yes, gentlemen, have a good day.  Bye, sweetie.  Are you working on any projects?  Uh, actually, I believe that there's one, uh, coming up for the marathon.  If you, uh, keep your eyes open, you may see something really special.  All right.  Good.  Thank you, Doug.  When's the marathon?  Sunday.  Ooh.  All right, let's go to Ted in Colorado. 
[00:34:00]  What's up, Ted?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Ted.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you, you've done it great on the radio.  Uh, Ron and Fez did a great job.  It was funny as hell.  They had no clue that they were on the air.  Fez started saying, oh, we're broadcasting live?  That was funny as hell.  You guys did a great job.  Sounded good.  Sorry.  Couldn't be there at the party, boys.  Man.  I mean, if this was college radio, that'd be funny, but shouldn't people know all this  stuff beforehand?  Yeah.  That maybe the thing they're doing is going to be live? 
[00:34:30]  You would think that would be top priority.  Inform the people on the air that they are indeed on the air.  That's what that little light was for when they invented radio.  Didn't they have a light that said on the air?  That was like the first thing they invented.  Hey, we're broadcasting.  Here's something called the radio.  Right.  What else do we need?  A light that tells us when we're on.  That was invention number two.  Yeah, there's a hundred things you've got to worry about.  Number one is, well, tell your broadcasters that, yes, indeed, what they're doing will 
[00:35:00]  be heard by people.  I think that would be the first thing you do.  Yeah.  I can understand if you didn't get to the 99th point on the list.  Right.  But number one, I think, is important.  DJ in Wisconsin.  What's up, DJ?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing today?  All right.  All right.  Hey, you know, the other night there, I was listening to that, and I tried pushing you  guys to everyone I know.  I always got you on in my truck. 
[00:35:30]  I had some people in there going from bar to bar.  We listened to it for about 10 minutes, and I tell you, I had to turn it on.  You know, you're a douchebag.  Listen to this motherfucker.  You know, I had a lot of people trying to turn them on in what you do.  Yeah.  Yeah, pick that broadcasters.  Yeah, thanks, sir.  What a cop.  You stink.  Shut up.  Stop trying to make us feel like we lost a whole bunch of new listeners.  You know, guys, I own a gymnasium.  I packed it with people.  I tried, you know.  I had a bunch of people here.  Now, you guys. 
[00:36:00]  Wisconsin.  God damn, that was bad.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, guys.  That's what he was doing, too, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You know, I had people with me.  They were all potential lizards.  Now, forget it.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Let's say hi to Mike in Brooklyn.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  First of all, as a listener, I had no idea you guys were going to be broadcasting it live  either.  Great.  No one knew.  But as far as that goes, the only part I got to hear was the costume contest, which 
[00:36:30]  does not really make the most exciting radio.  Of course not.  No.  Costume contests, I believe you never hear them on the radio live.  Yeah.  But the pictures from the costume contest are very entertaining.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Well, you know, we can't talk about the costumes without bringing up our own Danny.  Wow.  He kept going to me, why are you looking at me?  I'm like, why?  Why?  Are you kidding me?  You couldn't stop looking at him. 
[00:37:00]  I'll say.  He's got a set of balls, this kid, though.  There you go.  And everyone saw him.  Danny's got a set of balls, though.  You've got to give it to him.  I like his costume.  I thought it was great.  I would have to say Danny had the most outrageous costume at the whole event.  Name another costume that was more outrageous than that.  Oh, my God.  There he is.  Than that.  Oh, is that something?  The pictures are up on openinganthony.com, foundrymusic.com.  Right.  I knew I was going to get so smashed today. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  I was not looking forward to it.  Well, it's a great costume.  I like how he took his tighty-whities and drew pubes on it.  Well, because I wanted to make it look like my cock was tucked in.  Like you were tucked in the famous scene.  But he's got, like, it's blue.  He used blue Sharpie.  He did actually tuck.  We were up in the VIP area talking, and one of the girls said, why don't you tuck?  It's not tucked.  And he actually tucked and pulled his things down, his little boxers down, and backwalked a little bit. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  It was very realistic.  Fantastic.  Oh, my God.  I can't even look at it on the screen.  I see it at the corner of my eye, and I don't.  Yeah, it is really something.  And I'm such a dick.  He had the costume on for maybe 10 minutes, and then I see him backstage, and he's dressed like he is today.  I'm like, what happened to your costume?  And he goes, dude, it's really not going over like I expected or too well.  I'm like, no, it's going over great.  Yeah, get it back on.  You've got to put it back on. 
[00:38:30]  I love when he was on stage, and he was trying to be in character, actually.  And he was talking to him.  His eyes were actually closed.  He was like, would you?  But his eyes were, like, closed.  He was so into the role.  It was good, Danny.  He really got into it.  It's called drunk.  Again, another drunk.  And then he was brave enough to do a sing-along with the whole crowd.  That was really funny.  From Silent Hill as a musical.  Yeah.  I mean, well, because I knew you guys.  I knew what you guys were doing.  You were setting me up, because you brought out Nathaniel and Travis and Derek first.  You know, and excluded me, because I knew you were going to take me out separately.  And I'm like, well, now I've got to come up with, like, a gag to do, I suppose. 
[00:39:00]  So I just figured I would do the lines from the song and have the crowd finish.  Oh, we got it?  All right, let's try this.  Hit it.  Where's Danny?  Well, let's have Nathaniel intro Danny.  Hold on.  Can you stop this?  Here you come?  Yeah, I forgot to mention this, by the way.  Yeah.  Both of us sounded like we had really bad colds.  Yeah, why is that? 
[00:39:30]  Why?  Because everything had to be yelled.  Do you really have to ask why at this point?  Everything, we had to yell everything.  Because this far into our radio careers, we still have people that don't know what the fuck they're doing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Hit it.  Where's Danny?  Well, let's have Nathaniel intro Danny.  Here comes the gayest motherfucker on the planet.  Danny! 
[00:40:00]  Never will...  You grab the lotion on the skin and it does this way it's cold.  You can do that louder.  Dick me.  He's instigating.  It drops the lotion on the skin and it rolls against the holes.  And when it's done, there's one more little chance, guys. 
[00:40:30]  Holding the mic out for the audience.  Yeah, it's finished.  Let's hear it for Danny, everyone.  Wow.  Danny.  What a set of balls behind that blue Sharpie.  You couldn't find a black fucking Sharpie.  This whole fucking place and the studio and this whole fucking Hard Rock Cafe.  Not one black Sharpie to be found.  And they started throwing Sharpies.  Thank you.  They were throwing black Sharpies at us. 
[00:41:00]  They're pelting you.  There it is.  A little clip of Danny as he hit the stage.  Isn't it great to hear yourself drunk?  Oh, yeah.  I was about to say, I really just need to stay away from alcohol for some time.  As that clip was playing, he turned completely around and just wanted it to go away.  Yeah.  Make it go away.  Make it go away.  Help the mic out.  You know what you needed?  We needed a tape recorder backstage for the interns and everything.  Well...  Being real drunk.  That would have...  Now that would have been radio.  Well...  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Why didn't we do that?  Instead we get...  Hey, guys, let's get my big in.  There's a lot of things we should have done.  Shh.  Danny's costume kicked ass.  And he had the attitude to make it work.  It was great.  Oh, he's got balls.  Oh, no.  Speaking of costumes...  Sorry, Eric.  I've got to call you out.  Because I was the only one that knew what...  He knew.  I'm looking right at him and I had no clue.  And I finally told Anthony and you got like douche chills, didn't you?  I had no idea.  Everyone got douche chills. 
[00:42:00]  Eric shows up at the party, E-Rock, who sits to my left, and he had a goatee.  Yeah, that's what I noticed.  And I guess you were growing the goatee over break, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I didn't know.  I didn't notice that you had the goatee on Monday, I guess.  So I see him at the party and I'm like, hey, that's a cool new look you got.  I like the goatee.  But he's looking a little older.  Thinking he's just, you know, growing a goatee.  Yeah.  Not thinking much of it.  And then I noticed like his kind of purry-winkle-ish shirt. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  And then I'm like, wow, why would he like wear a shirt like that to the Halloween party?  You know, just dumb thoughts that are going through my mind as I'm wandering around because  he's dressed a little different than he usually is.  So obviously you're going to notice.  And then he's got like a black hat on.  And I'm like, hmm.  And then I went, oh, my God, Eric, don't tell me you came to the party dressed as Anthony.  And he goes, yeah, I did.  Yeah.  And I go, dude, no one knows that.  I didn't know.  No one knows that.  Even Anthony. 
[00:43:00]  Because then I told Anthony and he went, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, jeez.  Like.  Because you always wear a hat.  So we're used to seeing you in a cap.  And the goatee is not that big a stretch.  Right, right.  And let's be honest, the shirts you wear are normally borderline horrendous.  So that was just one more.  And the real interesting part of this also is that when we are out, I don't wear a hat.  I usually only wear a hat here in the studio.  So you were there.  Yeah, you were there dressed as Anthony would in studio. 
[00:43:30]  And I'm not wearing a hat live at the event.  You are.  So you're completely.  People would have known it was Anthony if you put that outfit on and carried a bag of money over your shoulder.  If you really wanted to be me, you should have just stayed at home and said, fuck everybody.  Exactly.  That's what I do.  Well, you know what, though?  Now we've got a side-by-side shot.  There it is.  We've got E-Rock dressed as Anthony.  And he's standing next to Anthony.  And, wow, I can't even tell you two apart. 
[00:44:00]  E-Rock, it's you with a goatee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's the best you can do as far as a periwinkle shirt?  I tried all over to find something close to what he had.  I would never wear a stripe that wide.  That would be crazy.  When did you finally realize that not one human being recognized in costume?  He's like a Brady kid looking for a surprise party.  Yeah.  Probably walked in and figured the cameras would go off.  I realized when we were walking on stage and before you guys started talking, Opie goes, 
[00:44:30]  you're supposed to be Anthony, right?  Yeah.  And then I realized, oh, great, nobody knows what the fuck is going on.  I started talking to him about his goatee.  Right.  And I was like, would you grow that so people would think you're older or something?  Yeah.  Like, I'm talking to him about his costume that's supposed to be me, not even knowing.  Well, he didn't even really commit because I'm looking at the picture now and the goatee doesn't even look that thick yet.  No.  It's the best I could do for a week.  He's boyish.  Yeah.  Well, you gave it a shot at something. 
[00:45:00]  One guy came as me from the old Apollo air conditioning days.  That was good.  Oh, yeah?  He had an Apollo air conditioning shirt on and a giant afro on his head.  It's very funny.  Bastard.  I'm the new Eric Nagel.  Hey, guys.  Surprise party for me.  Let's say hi to Lloyd in Dallas.  Lloyd.  Lloyd.  Hi.  I was just calling about the party.  And Monday, everything sounded just horrible. 
[00:45:30]  I mean, the audio was all off.  Everyone was frustrated.  But the party that night sounded great.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  Well, that's what we're dealing with today.  Everyone there had a great time.  The party really did rock.  Hair of the dog that bit me, Lloyd.  But the broadcast was, you know, a disaster.  Yeah.  In general, it was definitely a disaster.  I was wondering why Eric was wearing a faggy shirt.  Now it all makes sense.  Not fast Freddy. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  You should have done something with the germs, Hawk.  Something that was said that you didn't want people to touch me.  Right.  That probably would have been.  Like Purell in your pocket.  Somebody gave me some Purell.  Some of that antibacterial stuff.  Used it right in front of Pete.  After Pete shakes his hand, Anthony opens his own hand and dumps a gallon of Purell into it.  And just started wiping.  Yeah.  I was like people with the high-fiving and shaking my hand in front of the stage.  And I just followed up, squeezing it into all their hands. 
[00:46:30]  I'm just Purelling everybody.  Because that lunatic that distributes it was there.  Just as a big pumpkin.  There's some insane guy that just has like antiseptic stuff that he gives us at appearances.  Well, he came by and helped a show back in the NAW days.  Yeah.  Did he help clean up one of the 55-gallon drum challenges or something?  Yeah, I think that was it.  So he had his moment of fame and ever since he's been trying to ride it out.  And he keeps bringing stuff like that, which is good, I guess.  You remember me? 
[00:47:00]  I brought you a stick up in the late 80s.  Yeah, we know you.  It's like, thanks.  You have some great cleaning products.  But there's not much else we could do with you.  Do you understand?  There's not much range here.  How about cleaning your body out of about 120 pounds?  I'm standing there talking to a girl.  And all he's standing there, and he's going, and he's being nice, but he's going,  Dude, this one chick wants to fuck you.  The girls don't want to fuck you. 
[00:47:30]  I'm like, hey, stupid.  I'm working here.  What are you talking about?  It was a girl from Massachusetts.  Lovely gal.  Is that the picture that I saw online with you?  There's a picture of you online, and your hand is down some girl's pants.  She put it there.  If that's the picture, I'm thinking, no, that's actually a different girl.  Oh, okay.  No, I know.  This was a girl who I'd made the acquaintance of and was chatting.  Chatting.  Chatting.  So I'm like, dude, that's not a professional move. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Let's say hi to Ronnie in Chicago.  Ronnie.  Hi.  How are you all doing?  Good.  How did it sound to you out there in radio land?  Myself, I thought it was excellent.  It was really good.  I really enjoyed it.  ResinFez done a good job.  And for my very first concert I ever heard live on the radio or XM, that was really good.  I mean, why are you guys kicking yourselves' asses?  Why are you guys kicking your asses anyway?  Well, dude, ResinFez didn't know they were live.  I mean, did you actually know that ResinFez were live, or did you not know? 
[00:48:30]  Well, they said they were live.  How long have you been listening to the show, Ronnie?  Oh, I've been listening to you guys for about three months now.  Yeah, you've got a lot to learn, though.  Well, I'm glad you liked the show, definitely.  I did, I did.  This is part of the program where we spend time just beating ourselves up.  Why?  You're not going to get this from many radio shows out there, because it's fun.  That's true, that's true, that's true.  It's fun.  All righty.  All right.  You all have a great day.  Thank you, sir.  Jesus, Jimmy.  This picture's of me.  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:00]  Mock sodomizing about nine different people.  Yeah, what the hell is that?  By the way, and I didn't request any of these pictures.  They were going, the girls were going, all right, take a really dirty one.  And I think they knew I wasn't going to do anything truly awful.  By the way, the point I want to make, there's some great pictures of Jimmy that we're now checking out.  Yeah.  Where he's pretty much simulating having doggy style sex with this chick.  Yeah.  There's another picture of him with his hand down the front of another girl's pants.  Same girl.  Same girl on that one.  She put it there.  All right.  But these pictures are really hilarious and fun, right? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  This is what he was doing as you and I are sweating our balls off on stage going, holy  shit, 600 plus thousand people around America are trying to listen to this horse shit.  Where's Jimmy?  Well, you guys get to enjoy where Jimmy was.  Yeah.  While your pals were on stage sweating it out.  As I'm seeing these pictures, this is how obsessed with my own fatness I've been.  Every time I'd see one of these pictures, I'd be like, wow, your face does look a little  thinner.  That's all I was noticing was the fact that my face looked a little thinner. 
[00:50:00]  I didn't care what I was doing.  She actually put my hand there and it wasn't touching anything at the top of her panties,  unfortunately.  All right.  This really hurt.  Well, we're going to get some more clips from the Halloween party as we move forward today.  Right?  Can you see that one?  Are we doing that, Eric?  Yeah, we have a couple more.  All right.  Also, Imus' Rob Bartlett is talking about us again today.  Love Rob Bartlett.  This just came in, actually.  We can play this before we go to break.  You must be just going crazy.  You've had that delicious chocolatey donut in front of you the entire first break. 
[00:50:30]  Why would you torture yourself like that?  And I rarely eat donuts.  I know.  I'm going to really enjoy the goodness.  Like a madman that this brings.  Here's Imus this morning once again with Rob Bartlett.  And then Brian Wilson is here.  Hi.  How are you, Opie?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I'm not Opie.  I know you keep saying that, but I figure out you just don't want people to know because  you'll get mobbed.  Sure.  That's probably it.  Right, Anthony?  That's exactly it. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  Probably is it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't understand.  I think it's great, but I don't understand why they just continue with this.  It seems to be very inside, no?  Very funny running gag they've got going on.  It's great for us.  It's great for our show.  It's great for us to play it on our show.  All right.  So we'll have more clips.  We also have to do Stalker Patty on Maury.  We ran out of show on Monday.  We did.  And there was a great ending clip that was very cool. 
[00:51:30]  So in case you missed Stalker Patty on Maury Povich, you know what?  We'll do it next after the break.  How's that sound?  And also we've got to announce a winner to the Assault on the Media Contest.  Halloween night.  Someone might have won the contest.  Really?  Really?  On the last day of October, someone might have beat everybody.  Wow.  We'll let you know what that's all about.  I'll explain something, too.  Why?  Just something someone said to me yesterday, but I'll tell you afterwards so I don't blow  any surprises.  Big A dressed like Stalker Patty, by the way, was the creepiest goddamn thing. 
[00:52:00]  Really disturbing.  Yeah, some of those pictures are up and, oh, just frightening.  Is there a link to all these pictures on opieandanthony.com to make it easy for people out there?  All right.  Opie is spelled O-P-I-E because we're getting email.  How do you spell Opie?  Hey, Opie.  Big A looked like with the wig and the lipstick, like the bug eyes.  He looks like somebody looks like when you walk in and they've just killed their own parents  with a hatchet.  Like that's the face and the wig somebody has on.  And that's how they just find you in the corner. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Just sitting there, not realizing what you've done.  Yeah.  You had to dress up before you kill your parents, putting up no fight, just take you out of  the front of the place in cuffs and you're just like, what?  They have to tie your hands because your fat wrists are too big and retard strength-ish to  put cuffs on.  Look at the picture of him.  Oh, he is an absolute creepola.  I got a little tease before we go to break that'll get a lot of people talking.  A lot of people talking.  I think Anthony and I have no choice at this point. 
[00:53:00]  I believe that I will be taking a meeting with an arch enemy in the very near future.  Oh.  With an arch enemy.  Huh?  I won't have to be there?  No.  No?  Just like all the other meetings, I'll let you know what happens.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  It's a fucking house of cards. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  You can do that because I'm the only one that accepts phone calls from our agent anymore.  I gave up on him.  I have to deal with him.  I only deal with the people that can help us.  Oh, and you're talking about the people at XM that I don't talk to?  Well, you got to think they're going to help us eventually.  We're here for now.  You got to hope.  Yeah, Bob.  We'll get that TV deal with a TV production house that has no credits.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'll be taking your phone calls.  But isn't he working on it?  Huh? 
[00:54:00]  What?  But isn't he?  Don't even get me started.  No, but I thought something was in there.  And he knows he's pissed.  He's not even trying to reach out to me.  Doesn't try to talk to you anymore.  He only reaches out to you when he knows that he can't reach out to me at all.  Yeah.  That's always fun.  Because now it's, I take phone call, I transcribe into email, send off to Opie.  Opie takes meetings, transcribes into email, sends to me.  But I thought Bob was working on it.  Oh, that?  What?  What?  Oh, no.  The who, what?  No, not the TV. 
[00:54:30]  TV.  Stop it.  But I believe this meeting will be going down in the very near future.  Mm-hmm.  An arch enemy.  Lady Di?  No joke.  An arch enemy.  But we might not have a choice.  Mm-hmm.  Might not have a choice.  Might not.  At this time.  All right, with that, we'll go to break, and we'll continue.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts. 
[00:55:00]  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive.  Yeah.  That a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  In case you didn't know.  Audio Slave, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:55:30]  I hope you know what WoW is about at this point.  Please.  Also, having a WoW sticker just supports the show, you know?  Yeah.  We love seeing the WoW stickers out there. 
[00:56:00]  All the fans love seeing other people with WoW stickers.  It's kind of fun.  I see them out there, and I pull up real close, see if it's a new one or an old one.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  A new one.  If you need a WoW sticker, self-addressed stamped envelope, just send it off to us here in New York City.  111 West 57th Street, New York, New York.  10019, I believe.  That address is up on opianthony.com, and we'll send out the WoW stickers.  You throw it on your ride, and there are women out there, lots of them, that will flash you if they see the WoW. 
[00:56:30]  Just leave the ladies alone, by the way.  Just let them do their thing, and then you go about your day, okay?  Like fishing.  Exactly.  Why do you guys, why do you keep saying that it was only 600,000-plus people listening,  when in the mornings you say over a million are listening?  That's Sonny Farrelly from Boston.  Well, Sonny, it was Halloween night, so we're competing against a lot of things.  And it's at night.  There's generally less listeners at night. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, and that's just a guesstimate.  I don't know the exact number of people.  What's he getting at?  I don't know.  There's definitely more people that listen to us in the morning than if we're all of a sudden on in the middle of the night.  Not in the middle of the night, but at night, yeah.  Or even in afternoons.  It's just how it goes in radio.  So we're just guessing, really.  I definitely think it was a lot less than a million.  A lot less than the people that listen to us on a daily basis in the morning.  That Sonny pisses me off a lot of times. 
[00:57:30]  Why?  I don't know.  It's just like some of his instant feedbacks are a little piss-off.  You know what?  I'm not even going to deal with his anymore.  Banned.  Here we go.  Just a click of a link right here.  And he is banned.  I'm not playing that gag today.  You ban whoever the fuck you want.  I hate you all.  I fucking hate you all.  If you want to ban the whole fucking lot of them, go ahead.  Just right down the line, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban, ban. 
[00:58:00]  My brother's in the studio, by the way.  Elmo, what's happening, people?  Good to see you here this morning.  Thank you very much.  It was good to see you and your LARPing gear the other night.  LARPing gear.  I was a lord of the manor.  People were like, what are you, a pirate?  I'm okay.  You want me to be?  You know, I was kind of feeling bad about myself when I was heading over to the Hard Rock.  I'm like, why couldn't I step up and, like, get a costume on?  I swear to God, I was thinking that. 
[00:58:30]  Because everyone was all excited, and I was hearing from people.  My phone's ringing, and they're all excited about their costumes.  I'm like, God, why for once can't I step up and just get a damn costume on for Halloween?  Yeah.  What's it going to hurt?  And then I was reminded that I made the right decision.  It's like, oh, okay, now I remember why.  Now I feel good.  I just can't do that.  I just can't do what you do.  I knew my fans wanted to see the rapier and wanted to see my bow. 
[00:59:00]  Man, we get the moniker of being shock jocks and being ultra cool.  Cool.  And then you walk out with puffy shirts, and that was a lord of the manor.  You know how cool I would have looked hundreds of years ago?  I was going to say, puffy shirts and weapons from another era gone by.  I was just probably the only one walking around sporting a fucking three-foot-long sword, too, in New York City. 
[00:59:30]  I don't know about that.  Did you see those photos I took?  I was close.  Yeah, that one.  Nice one.  Doggy style.  And I am so sick of looking at Norton's horn-ons, man.  I didn't show you one, did I?  I know that sounds absolutely awful, but my brother finally got to experience what I live when I hang out with Norton.  It was very lovely.  Very lovely.  And there are women around.  It is amazing what it takes for you just to get wood.  Or were you on Cialis or something? 
[01:00:00]  No, no, no.  It was just turned on.  It was morning.  Yeah, but nothing was going on for you to be that turned on.  And then, of course, we're at a diner in the middle of the night there.  Those are good pants for me.  Those are good pants for you?  Yeah.  Was it like pup tent type pants?  Yeah.  I'm sitting next to Jim.  There's a whole bunch of us at this diner.  And all of a sudden, I know something's going on, because you can feel the happiness to my right, and he's never happy.  And then he leans back and just kind of puts it on display and kind of hints like, look, look, look. 
[01:00:30]  And you look down, and there's just a fucking monster trying to peek out of his pants.  You've got to do that.  So I'm like, if I've got to look at this, I might as well turn my brother on to this, too.  I'm like, Darren, take a look.  I thought it was because of the food.  I mean, it was good food there, so I just assumed it was that.  I got an extra piece of pork roll.  And all you hear from my left from my brother is, ah!  It's like, horrible.  I was talking to a...  You need a bottle of ketchup, Jimmy. 
[01:01:00]  Just ask me.  I'll buy it, boy.  You don't have to steal it from the diner.  I was talking to a young lady, and he enjoys showing his friends.  What's going on?  It was just silly, because I'm talking to this girl on my right.  Silly.  And it was just funny, because I could hear him giggling on my left.  And I'm, like, leaning back at the table, and I'm chatting with her.  And I'm showing my rod, and, like, you know, I'm making it move.  It was just a goof.  Just a goof.  But she has no idea what I'm doing.  No.  No.  I thought I was getting vibes off her.  I was like, yeah, she's cute, and another Philly girl that I just go nowhere with. 
[01:01:30]  I didn't want to sleep with her.  I just wanted to hang with her for a little while.  And she's like, oh, give me a call.  Jimmy, but...  I don't know.  Well, you did realize that the waiter spent a lot of time talking to you after seeing that happen.  Yes.  I got to tell you something about Jimmy.  I might be...  If I'm wrong, call me out on this, Jimmy.  Okay.  Jimmy wants to get laid with minimal work.  No.  Well, yeah.  You're right.  How long were you hanging out with this girl, who was very nice, by the way?  But actually, that night, I wasn't talking about banging her.  Like, I really... 
[01:02:00]  I didn't expect to bang her.  But, dude, we...  You didn't even...  You didn't know we're going into the diner.  No.  So, we were in the diner maybe less than an hour.  Right.  And you were pissed off because she wasn't going home with you.  But not...  I know that that sounds like...  If I was expecting a banger...  You were pissed off, and now you want to say how much Philly girls suck again.  No, Philly girls...  My problem with Philly girls is this.  And I've had this with every single one of them.  There's always, like, you get along, you get along, and then nothing.  Now, was I expecting, like, sex from her?  No.  I mean, I know she's a nice girl, and I know she's not the type that just bangs automatically. 
[01:02:30]  But I really wasn't expecting to take her home and bang her.  I figured I had to make out on the couch or something.  It really wasn't.  I didn't expect her to lead to sex because I got nice vibes off her, but I didn't get,  like, fuck vibes.  I know the difference.  So, it's like, when you want to hang with a chick, it's just like, alright, it'd be nice  to meet someone.  But you realize some of these girls need a little more than just a quick meal at a diner  at two in the morning.  No, I know, but...  It's like, you expect, alright, well, hey, who...  He did give him more.  Yeah.  Showing his lap.  Right.  But he's sitting next to her.  They're enjoying burgers and stuff. 
[01:03:00]  Next thing you know, he's fast-forwarding and thinking, alright, she's going to be shitting  on my chest in an hour.  Well, yeah, who wouldn't make that leap?  That's a logical leap.  It's like trying to leap over the goddamn Grand Canyon, my friend.  But no, I don't mean, like...  Without a motorcycle.  I wasn't looking for...  If I was looking for sex, I'd go, yeah, but I really wasn't.  Like, I know when I'm, like, in complete filth vibe.  Yeah.  If I'm getting sexual vibes off a person and they don't bang me, then I get really annoyed.  But I wasn't getting that off her.  I was just getting nice vibes.  Like, I thought she kind of liked me a little bit, but...  Mm-hmm.  So, I kind of know the difference and I know what, like, what my motives are. 
[01:03:30]  But just the fact that she wouldn't even come hang for a while.  It's like, what do you think I'm going to do?  Just attack you?  Well...  I know, they do think that.  They do think that.  That's what annoys me.  It's like, don't you realize if I try to kiss you and you don't want me to kiss you, you  just leave.  What am I going to do?  Fucking jump on you?  I mean, I'm not a bad guy.  Maybe you all.  And Ope's girlfriend was vouching for me.  He's like, he's a nice guy.  He's not going to...  And I wouldn't have done anything.  Oh, she told me afterwards, though, man.  God, did Jimmy put me in a bad position?  Because it's her friend who's, like, the nicest of all her friends.  She's, like, as innocent as they come. 
[01:04:00]  And all of a sudden, Jimmy's, like, you know, he's pulling in the right-hander from the bullpen,  Lindsey, and goes, come on, Lindsey, vouch for me.  I'm a nice guy.  But Lindsey has heard the stories behind him because we've hung out enough.  So Lindsey's like, oh, my God, do I throw one of my good friends to the fucking line or  not?  But I would, but I mean, nice guy in the sense that, not that I'm not a perv, I mean,  that's pretty common knowledge, but I'm not going to, you're not in any, like, you're  not in any danger if you come home with me, like, well, who is this guy?  I don't know this guy.  What's he going to do to me?  Well, there should be a scale so you could say, Lindsey, I'm not looking for the Cleveland 
[01:04:30]  steamer.  I'm just looking for a little make-out.  Yeah, really.  Then she probably would have definitely said, oh, yeah, very cool.  Well, she did actually go to bat for me, but, I mean, she was, like, later on, she's  like, man, that was really tough.  But it wasn't, I wouldn't have attacked a girl.  You'd never have any danger come.  There's a difference between being a little perv and being aggressive and dangerous, and  that I'm not.  If she's into it, you'll be there.  Oh, please.  I'll smell your ass after you run around the block.  But if you say no, if you say no, I'm not going to be jamming my fingers in you.  Like, that's, to me, what's important. 
[01:05:00]  If a woman knows she can just get up and go, fuck this, I'm going, and leave.  Yeah.  You always can.  Yeah, well.  That's the reputation I have.  All right.  This just in, by the way.  Brother Joe has called.  He does not want his performance with his fine U2 tribute band.  To you, to be replayed.  To be replayed.  On 2-0-2.  And he doesn't have to worry.  That show is being burned.  And Joe loves promotion.  Yeah.  He gets it.  Oh, my God.  This was supposed to be a big, big win for him and his band.  And now he's calling to say he doesn't want his set rebroadcasted. 
[01:05:30]  They sounded great.  They sounded unbelievable in the club, and that's what's so too bad about this right now.  So, officially, he does not want to be part of the rebroadcast.  I think we're just going to have to bury the show.  The show is going to have to go down, and the history is one of those that just go away.  Right.  And speaking of brothers, my brother Darren is in studio.  Did they give out your t-shirts?  You said Ellen before.  Well, he's got many nicknames.  Many names.  His new name is Daryl.  We like calling him Daryl. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, what was up with that fucking crap yesterday?  Daryl.  The girl that Jimmy was trying to bang and shove his fingers up her ass.  No.  She kept calling me Daryl.  I was trying to get to know her.  Oh, that's what I meant.  She was cute, too.  Yeah.  I was digging her, too, until she called me the wrong name all day.  Daryl.  I would have loved that.  She would have told the cops, I can't believe Daryl teabagged me.  Did they give out your shirts, though?  I saw people walk around with them on, and I had to go get them from my friends who were  there.  Oh, yeah?  So I don't know, but there was like 600 of them, so they were supposed to be giving out. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, my brother came up with a great t-shirt, and they're going to go away very soon.  If you want to get one through the mail, go to opianthony.com.  Yeah, they're still at Ziggy's My Radio Store.  MyRadioStore.com?  Yeah.  But they're just about done.  Tell them Daryl.  I want one, too.  Yeah, tell them Daryl sent Daryl.  Well, they didn't give out all of them, so there's got to be a box of them somewhere.  I want an XL.  They're probably still at the Hard Rock Cafe.  I don't know.  I don't think they're in studio right now.  I'm not going to say which one, but I'm incorporating an opes fine brother to help with a logo for 
[01:07:00]  something, a shirt for old Jimmy Norton.  Ooh.  Some type of weather phenomenon.  Possibly.  Possibly.  Would be.  Well, my brother does fine work.  Yes.  If you want some work done, get a hold of my brother.  Jesus.  It's a good Daryl commercial here today.  Daryl.  Fucking Daryl.  Bastard Philly girls.  What did we say we were going to do after break?  Oh, the Stalker Patty stuff?  From Maury.  From Maury Povich?  Yeah, but then you, I remember you were asking, we were talking in the break, and you're like,  after break, we're going to do Stalker Patty, but first, where's Jim going to be November 
[01:07:30]  23rd through 26th?  I'm like, I don't want to talk about that.  Wow.  It's not about me.  Wow.  Damn, open assistant.  All right.  Do you feel like you have to promote this time?  Oh, plug?  Yeah, definitely.  You don't have to plug anymore.  Have to.  You just pack places.  You just pack places.  No, it's word of mouth kind of thing.  Like, if the Stones are going to play some small club, do you ever hear a promotion for  it?  No, but the place is packed.  That's what Jimmy Norton's all about.  All right.  Well, here's myself, Mick, Bill, and Keith.  We'll be performing at Carolines November 23rd through 26th, which is over Thanksgiving 
[01:08:00]  break.  So, this ticket's going to go on sale today.  212-757-4100, Carolines, here in New York City.  Speaking of which, Bill Wyman, that was the best part of the Maury Povich show.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  She could have chose anyone.  Well, that's typical Patty, who she would want to be into.  And you've got to think if there's potential guys out there going, ah, she's not that bad. 
[01:08:30]  There's someone for everyone, they say, right?  I don't know.  But I think she kind of really ruined that by saying that her dream date is Bill Wyman.  Bill Wyman.  Picture her, Bill Wyman, doing crossword puzzles after a little game of bowling.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Just the fact that not only that she went for a guy who's probably worth about $430 million.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  Aim a little lower.  Please.  All right.  Well, we got some clips from the Maury Povich show. 
[01:09:00]  This was Monday.  We didn't get to play all of this on Monday's show.  So we're going to do it right at the end of the show.  Stalker Patty on Maury Povich.  It was making nerds into turn your nerd into a knockout.  Into a knockout.  That was the title of the show.  Okay.  Here's Maury intro on the whole damn thing.  Now, think being a virgin at 40 years old.  Now, that's a shocker.  Well, my next guest, Patty, is 50 and a virgin.  She is so famous for being a 50-year-old virgin. 
[01:09:30]  She is the star of the Opie and Anthony XM satellite radio show.  Now, Patty's friend, Joyce, who's with me now, says that Patty looks so much like a geek, the men just aren't even interested in her.  And Patty's here because she's desperate to get a hot, sexy makeover so she can finally, after 50 years, be intimate with a man.  And then they played the clip, and it was split screen of Patty talking on mic and me talking on mic. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  Which made it look like she is part of the show, like she's here on a daily basis as, like, the whole.  Right.  They're not good representation.  No.  My name is Patty, and I am a 50-year-old virgin.  I have been a geek and a nerd my whole life, and guys just won't talk to me.  I rarely party, but when I do, I just end up sitting there like a bump on a log. 
[01:10:30]  I'm definitely a geek.  My favorite thing to do on a Friday night is to bowl.  My idea of a cool dude would be somebody that I can bowl with and would like to do crossword puzzles with me.  I can't wait to look hot and sexy and meet the man right here.  Could you imagine sitting there, I don't know, four across, what is that, Patty? 
[01:11:00]  Could you give me the clue?  What kind of a date that would be?  What kind of a night that would be?  Snuggling up with her?  I bet three down.  What is it?  Starts with a D, I know, but it's five letters behind.  She giggles and leans into you?  Ooh.  I'd like you.  No, that's not the word, silly.  Oh, this one's easy.  Easy.  Oh, chicklet teeth. 
[01:11:30]  The star of the O.P. and Anthony show, great.  That represents the women of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Sure does.  All right, here's another clip.  Stalker Patty on Maury Povich.  Let me get this straight, Joyce.  This is a woman whose dream is to get a guy to bowl with her.  Yeah, no.  This is a walking time warp, Lori.  And this is a woman who wants more than anything else to get a guy to sit down and do crossword 
[01:12:00]  puzzles together.  Right.  How'd you meet her?  Well, we're fans of the O.P. and Anthony show.  I know O.P. and I know Anthony, yep.  And she has a crush on one of the hosts.  I know it's O.P.  Yes, yes.  And at this point.  Everybody has a crush on O.P.  Yes.  At that point, they again showed the same split screen of me and Patty.  Maury, what's the matter with you? 
[01:12:30]  I had to rewind.  I'm sorry.  One of the hosts.  I know.  It's O.P.  Yes.  I know.  Everybody has a crush on O.P.  We met and she sat in the corner wearing two coats in the month of June.  Right.  I'm thinking she's a hobo.  Right.  And you took her to a club.  We, for her 50th birthday, we took her to a strip club.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  Nothing.  Did somebody do a lap dance?  Yes.  She had two lap dances forcibly.  Right.  Gave her three apple martinis, sat her in a chair, gave her 40 bucks. 
[01:13:00]  And this is it right here.  This is what it looks like.  Yeah.  All right.  Here she is.  Patty.  Patty, come on out.  She was doing the robot dance to that music.  Right.  She's just horrific.  Even for her, that was embarrassing.  Oh, yeah.  With her pants pulled all the way up to her nipples.  On purpose, obviously, Patty doesn't dress that bad.  Really?  Well, she doesn't pull them up.  I know they do that for the Maury show.  Yeah.  She looks like William Frawley.  This is how stupid Bob Kelly is. 
[01:13:30]  I do a William Frawley reference in the car.  He goes, dude, don't try to impress me.  And I'm like, William Frawley?  He's like, who's that?  Are you kidding?  He didn't know who he was.  And I'm like, he's Rick.  He's a friend from I Love Lucy, stupid.  Like, he thought I was giving some obscure impression.  Yeah.  I thought he was saying that he knew who you were talking about.  And don't try to impress me with your, like, TV trivia.  Yeah.  He was saying don't try to impress me because he had no clue at all who it was.  Thought you'd maybe a scientist or something.  Yeah, like it was some obscure gentleman who I read about one time. 
[01:14:00]  What an ass.  Bob, you're a dope.  How are you, Patty?  Sit right here.  Look, Patty.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Oh, boy.  I told you it was genuine.  Patty, do you want to look nicer?  Yeah.  Do you want to find a guy?  I would love to have a line of them lining up for me.  You would?  But, but, Patty, you can't look like that and expect guys to line up.  It ain't going to happen. 
[01:14:30]  Well, I'm just waiting for the right person to come along.  Oh, you are?  He's not going to come along dressed like this, Patty.  Your pants are up to here.  Your pants are here.  Your pants are here.  It's going to end.  But I'll tell you.  How is a man going to find you?  Patty.  Well, the world will end and I'll still be left behind waiting.  No, come on.  If I had to ask you, Patty.  And your dreams.  Who you would like to, like, lose your virginity to?  I mean, who might they be?  Well, Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones is cute. 
[01:15:00]  He's one of the ugliest guys on the face of the world.  Oh, my Lord, do you need help?  We're going to get you some glasses, too, Patty.  Thank you very much.  I didn't know Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones is cute.  How great would it have been if she should have a Lexington Steel?  Bill Wyman.  She's a fool.  How about Bill Ward, you disloyal whore?  I don't know. 
[01:15:30]  I like that gentleman from Herman's Hermits.  He's cute.  Wow.  She wants a line of guys.  Yep.  A few video companies that would sponsor that event.  Virgin Bukkake.  Stalker Patty gangbang.  A whole big line just waiting.  All jacking it like they do waiting.  Isn't that the worst part of those movies? 
[01:16:00]  Like, the chick is getting banged.  And there's, like, a 60-guy gangbang.  And there's 60 guys just sitting there jacking off in a circle.  Waiting for their turn.  Talking to each other.  Yeah, look at how he's fucking around.  Who's next?  Put it in.  All right.  Well, later in the show, they did the transformation.  And Stalker Patty walked out.  And we got a huge plug here at the end of the show.  Listen to this.  Joyce has been trying to get Patty out there to meet guys somewhere other than a bowling alley in a crossword puzzle. 
[01:16:30]  Taking an act of Congress, actually.  Look at that.  Okay.  I'm going to close my eyes.  Bring on Patty out.  I'm going to open my eyes.  We'll see what we got.  Patty, come on out here.  I just, I want to state something that was pretty obvious, is that Patty's friend is a mess of a human being as well.  I mean, I'm free to make enemies on this show because I'm not here.  So, I know one of you guys want to say it, but she's sitting there cackling in the background. 
[01:17:00]  Act of Congress.  It's like, look at yourself.  What the fuck?  Look in a mirror.  Heal thyself, doctor.  What are you saying, that she wasn't hot?  That's pretty much, yeah, I could have cut it down to one sentence.  No, but I mean, you mean Patty, Patty, you're saying that Patty's...  You guys are terrible.  What's that?  Oh, man.  Hold on, madam.  So, you're saying that her friend, Joyce.  Yes.  Okay.  You.  Fuck you, Darren. 
[01:17:30]  It's Daryl.  Daryl.  I couldn't take the cackling, and oh, my God, no one's going to come around when you're  dressed like that.  What do you like about her?  Ooh, the waistline, mostly.  The face.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I don't know.  The clothing, everything.  What do you mean, guys?  We're not saying anything.  I really should have had a clothing.  She was very pumped.  Joyce.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hi, sweetie.  So, you're going to rip me apart, too? 
[01:18:00]  Well, go ahead.  We're not ripping you apart at all.  I said you were punctual.  Yeah.  Thanks, Opie.  Don't say thanks, Opie.  That's not Opie.  That was a nice thing you said.  Obviously, the voice sounds similar, but don't say thanks, Opie.  I've been very nice during this segment.  They cut out a lot of the show, too.  They spent, I think, the least amount of time with Patty than compared to the other people  who were getting made over.  And Maury's talked a lot about you, and they cut it out. 
[01:18:30]  Did they cut out more of your cackling in the background?  No, I guess not.  Oh.  What did Maury say about Opie and Anthony that they cut out?  He went a little more into the show and how Opie looks like Opie.  And I said, no, he's a lot cuter than Opie.  And they kept showing Anthony's clip.  Yeah.  Maury, that's Anthony.  That's not Opie.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess they had to cut that out.  I guess they didn't make any sense.  What?  But I just wish they would have worked on Patty's gait.  She had the gait fucking sign on high heels. 
[01:19:00]  Now, is this a twofer show?  Like, now is it your turn next?  And Patty's going to sit in the background cackling?  And then Maury will be like, here's Joyce!  I don't think so.  It was all about Patty.  It was all about her makeover.  And they actually, they cut her hair.  They highlighted it.  She looked okay.  She just needed to work on that charm at the end.  And Maury actually made fun of her.  They cut that out, too.  That had the audience going. 
[01:19:30]  Well, you know what they should have cut out?  Oh, God.  Here we go.  A waistline.  A waistline.  Okay.  Keep on.  Oh, no.  Opie, why'd you hang up on Joyce?  I had nothing to do with that.  She hung up.  I think Joyce is a lovely lady.  I like Joyce.  Wow, Daryl.  Can you see that it's a lot of fun around my house during the holidays? 
[01:20:00]  Just in case you think it's just me.  Just?  No.  It's not just Opie.  I got, uh...  There's five boys and two girls.  The girls are very nice in my family.  The sweetest little things you'd ever want to meet.  The guys, though?  Holy shit, we got problems.  Something going on there.  I got a hot cousin, by the way.  Oh, which one?  I don't remember.  I don't know if I...  Jimmy? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, we had a lot of cousins there.  Oh, no.  She was, uh...  She was very cute.  Yeah.  All right.  That would have to be Jennifer, I would imagine.  Well, let's get back to the Maury Povich show.  The end here.  Stalker Patty on Maury Povich.  Joyce.  Damn, Patty.  Joyce wanted to call in to give us a little insight, but Daryl over here  decided to beat her up a little bit.  Joyce, can you call back, please?  We do want to get the inside scoop. 
[01:21:00]  She looks pretty.  Oh, my Lord.  Look at you, Patty.  Patty, it's a little tough.  You look beautiful.  Yeah, thank you, Patty.  Maury, it's a little tough, Patty.  Oh, of course.  Okay?  How do you feel?  Different.  Different.  Oh, my goodness.  Very good.  You're shaking.  What's the matter?  I'm a little nervous.  You're a little nervous?  Patty, I don't believe you.  Do you think somebody might ask you out?  Maybe.  Please, God.  Wait, Patty, I'm amazed.  Joyce, don't you like this?  It's beautiful.  Isn't this terrific?  Yes. 
[01:21:30]  I can't believe it changed.  Now, by the way, in honor of you, Patty, and those scandalous boys, Opie and Anthony,  all of our audience members, because of Opie and Anthony, I didn't even know they were  this nice.  But because of their show on XM Satellite Radio, they have sent everybody in our audience  a free satellite radio.  There you go.  That's how Maury ended the show.  We cut the clip.  It went on a little longer than that.  Then the people came out with the XM radio, started passing it out to the crowd. 
[01:22:00]  Do you realize that Maury, when Patty came out for her big reveal after her makeover,  never said that she looked good or looked pretty?  This is Maury Povich, the same guy who a woman could trip, fall face first into a fire.  They bring her on the show, and Maury will hug her and go, you're a beautiful person.  Let me tell you how cute.  Or a progeria kid.  You are so cute and adorable. 
[01:22:30]  He could not bring himself to tell Patty she looked pretty.  Patty, you're so present.  You are here, Patty.  Involved.  What did he say?  You're shaking.  I'm a little nervous.  Yeah.  Let's go to Carl in New Jersey.  Carl.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, man.  Listen, Patty's like made a Teflon.  The fucking makeover didn't take or something. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know what else.  She looked like an aunt in a red dress.  Yeah, she didn't look much different, right?  Commenting that she's the only one on the whole makeover show that didn't look any different after the makeover.  They do these makeover shows.  Maury's done millions of these things.  The women show up.  They show them as the dorks backstage.  Then they bring them out, and you go, all right, that's pretty good.  This is the only time I've ever seen this show where the woman came out, she looked exactly, Patty looked exactly the same. 
[01:23:30]  Her hair looked better.  Her hair looked better.  Her hair looked a little better.  It was feathered a little bit.  Yeah, but I'm not even talking about, like, pieces.  Yeah, you could take a piece of this, like, her hair looked better.  No, her knees are shot.  She didn't look good.  She didn't look any better than she did before.  Well, that's why she's out, Patty, boys.  I'm out.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Morning, boy.  Morning, Eric.  How cool would it have been, though, when she walked out on stage for her to have done a face plant?  Because you could see her trip. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, on those heels, right.  Yeah, I saw that.  I'm sitting on the couch watching it on a videotape, and I started busting up laughing.  I fell off the couch.  My wife's like, what?  I rewanted so she could see it.  And she started laughing, too.  All right.  Are those video clips up on opianthony.com?  Yeah, they are.  Oh, they are up there?  I'm used to my penny loafers.  Very cool.  It's hard to walk in these high heels.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  What?  What happened?  A big thank you to Rob Bartlett once again.  That was a fantastic commercial for the opianthony show.  I couldn't hear what you were saying.  It got whacked back.  It got whacked back.  What the fuck is going on?  How do you not love them?  Rob Bartlett, we couldn't hear because the sound is off.  Just explain for everybody across America.  On MSNBC, the iMis' show is shown every day as well as heard on the radio.  And Bartlett is doing Brian Wilson.  So he's wearing this crazy Hawaiian shirt.  And he's wearing the one that Ope's brother designed, actually, Opie and Anthony's shirt. 
[01:25:00]  And it's like a five-minute commercial with just him talking and just Opie and Anthony on the screen.  Yeah, XM satellite radio.  XM satellite radio.  And as they pan out, he's got Wackbag up.  He was on Wackbag.  Checking out the fan site.  He's probably wondering aloud, I thought these guys liked this show.  Unbelievable.  How great of that.  It just seems very inside.  But, you know, keep doing it, Imus.  Thank you.  People get it, though.  You think they're getting it?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:25:30]  Well, Imus just absolutely hates Howard and will do anything he can to help us out.  I still want to meet him, but it's probably not going to happen.  Who?  Imus?  I can make that happen for you.  I don't.  Yeah.  Hi, do you think I could, um...  Yeah.  I just wanted you to know...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My dad and I used to listen to you.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You have a picture?  Uh, no.  Yeah.  He's got some great stories.  We'll try to make that happen. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  We should take a break.  When we get back, we'll do something else.  All right.  Saddy, let me tell you something.  You are such a human.  What?  Couldn't fucking bring him out.  You do make a great point, man.  The burn victims and all that.  Love the Maury.  All right.  I know what we can do when we get back.  The fake firefighter, uh, rapist guy.  Holy crap. 
[01:26:30]  Does it...  It's got a scam going on.  There's a sick story that, uh, is going on in New York City today.  Just bolt the doors.  Don't open to anybody.  That's what it is.  And, um, uh, guns.  Everyone should be packing heat.  Everyone.  Kenny Club Soda Kenny gave me a little, uh, grief about my choice of weaponry.  Oh, really?  Why?  Yeah.  Because he saw that I got picked up a shotgun for the house.  Home defense.  A lot of break-ins open.  Did you really?  Yeah, a lot of home invasions.  L.A.?  I was probably on the set. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  God, I get confused what shows you're part of now.  This was a big thing.  Home invasions all over Nassau County.  Anthony got rid of his rapier.  Well, I still have my rapier, but, uh, I won't have to pull that out.  Not that.  But that's your...  When I got my Remington.  Second weapon of choice.  That's right.  If they get through the shotgun and somehow our jams up, then I'll pull out my rapier.  But, uh, I picked up a nice Remington.  Why did Kenny say that was bad?  Well, Kenny goes kind of hard to swing around in a tight space. 
[01:27:30]  Like I'm in, you know, the closet or something.  But, uh, but I told him, I go, I don't have my pistol permit yet.  He goes, in, 38 special.  Reliable weapon.  And I agree with him, but you can't just go out and buy one.  Uh, there's too many rules and regulations as far as how you can buy guns and what kind of permits you need.  Takes a good six, eight months to get a pistol permit.  Not if you go north.  Where?  Just go north.  North?  Like Westchester? 
[01:28:00]  Connecticut?  A little south of Westchester.  Just go a little north of here.  You know, you've got to be, like, kind of in the place where you're, uh, where you live.  Yeah.  You can't, you can't, like, buy a gun in Nassau County, get a license, and then move into the city.  There's no rules if you go north.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, you're talking north just like north.  Like, like uptown Manhattan.  Just go north.  Oh, okay.  Then you buy all you want.  I understand.  You don't need to deal with those pesky rules and regulations and laws. 
[01:28:30]  Just go north.  Anyway, sorry.  Yeah, so Kenny gave me a little grief and said I should get a, uh, a handgun.  So, uh, I'm getting one of those licenses.  But today, I think I'm, I'm kind of getting into the whole shooting thing.  And, uh, I think I'm picking up, uh, an AR-15, which is the civilian M-16.  You're losing your mind.  I, uh, I, I lock my doors now and just hang out with my guns.  It's so much fun.  What's the matter?  They say a shotgun, by the way, is actually a good one to have at home because if someone 
[01:29:00]  breaks in and they, they said that they hear that, there's not a person alive that doesn't  know what that sounds like.  Oh, when you rack up around like that?  Yeah, absolutely.  No one doesn't, and you don't have to be as accurate with a shotgun if it's dark or if  you're frightened or it's at night, you just, you're kind of blasting in the general direction  and then you realize, oh, it's a loved one.  Mine also, on the, uh, on the pump, there's a, um, a mag light on there.  It's all, it's the same, uh, same model Remington that the, uh, Border Patrol agents use.  Of course. 
[01:29:30]  It's got a light on it.  So, uh, you could just squeeze the pump a little bit and that light comes on and anything  that's illuminated is just gone.  Gone.  Wow.  So, uh, yeah.  So I got that going for me.  Which is nice.  Yeah, the one out, you see a Kango and teeth.  All of a sudden, nice, nice new, uh, painting on the wall.  Looks like brain matter and skull.  Well, they get, my, my whole area has been invaded.  There's home invasions going on in Nassau County now and it has been a little, you know. 
[01:30:00]  That's scary.  A lot of people are getting, uh, broken into.  They tie them up with the phone cords and, uh, smack them around a little bit and then rip  them off.  And, uh, it kind of, there, there are a few gangsters.  Gangs out of Long Island that kind of see this happening and go, hey, you know, we've got  to get in on this action.  They get a little copycat and then it's been increasing.  So now what do you do?  You've got to defend yourself.  Lock your doors and windows and stay home with your guns.  Why don't you get some, uh, some night visions, some night goggles?  I have night vision. 
[01:30:30]  Do you really?  Yes, I do.  I have night vision.  I was joking.  I know you are.  But we, we also talked about why I had it.  I bought a, uh, we went on a cruise, the first cruise I went on.  You hang out on the balcony and you look and you can see people fucking on the balcony of  the cruise.  Oh, genius, dude.  Thank you.  Wow.  They think it's too dark for anyone to see, but I'm, you know, by the, by moonlight I  am watching people fuck through night vision goggles.  How do they not realize some sociopathic germaphobe is going to show up with $10,000 fucking military 
[01:31:00]  equipment so he can jerk off all over himself and watch them?  You really are slowly turning into a creep.  I am a wonderful creep.  It is just slowly happening in front of our eyes.  Holy shit.  It's nice.  Falls asleep, he wakes up in the afternoon, he's got fucking night vision goggles on.  Oh, sir.  Drunk with a, yeah, can place the bottom next to him. 
[01:31:30]  That's wonderful.  I'm a fine human.  I'm just adapting to the times that we live in.  Did you see anybody banging?  Uh, yeah.  You see a bunch of people, uh, having a little sexual relations on the, uh, it's  it's, it's what people do at night on cruise ships.  They go out because it's an opportunity.  When do you get the opportunity to bang out in the, uh, on the fresh air?  I gotta be honest, that's a brilliant idea.  It's a great idea.  How much are the night vision goggles?  Oh, they vary, like, ridiculous from, you know, 10 grand you could spend to, you know,  a couple of hundred.  You only need a couple hundred, right? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  You don't need a really good one.  That's all you need.  Yeah.  There's a porn director in L.A. who's very, very afraid of home invasions, um, because  he's from the East Coast, I guess, bad neighborhood.  So he has rifles, all kinds of weapons, night vision goggles, and someone I didn't stay  with him, they said he's nuts.  All you really need to do is keep your doors and windows locked at night.  Some people are still with the windows open.  It was such a wonderful evening.  I just thought I'd keep my windows open since it's 1955.  I kept the windows open. 
[01:32:30]  They came in.  People look for that shit, especially in nice neighborhoods.  We live in such a nice neighborhood.  Of course, that's what they're robbing.  They know you have good shit inside.  You don't leave the windows open.  Keep them locked.  Garages.  A lot of people are getting these home invasions through the garage doors.  Some people have their cars in the driveway with the garage door opener in their car, and  they leave their car door unlocked.  They lock everything else up. 
[01:33:00]  The guy just has to go, now he's in.  He's in your house.  How do you not hear that, though?  It doesn't matter if you hear it.  It's too late.  They are so quick, these guys.  They're in and out in a matter of minutes, and you're left there shaking your head like,  yi-yi-yi, just fucked up.  Don't even know what happened.  You hope they're in and out in a matter of minutes, because sometimes you don't want  them to rape the women or torture anybody.  Sometimes you're better off if they just rob you and beat them.  Exactly.  And for the most part, that's what these people have been doing, the home invaders.  But you get some perverts doing the same thing. 
[01:33:30]  I believe a strong door and lock on your bedroom.  That's where you're going to be.  That's where this usually happens.  You're building a panic room.  You don't need a panic room.  You're building a panic room.  What you need is a bedroom with a very secure door, something that can't be kicked in, something  with a better lock than those little dink, you know, little button, dink.  Oh, look, we're safe.  You're converting your walk-in closet to a panic room.  You need something secure that they're not just going to be able to wake up. 
[01:34:00]  Because imagine all of a sudden opening your eyes, waking up, and, hey, motherfucker, what  do you do?  There's no time to grab the gun.  You've got a gun to your head.  What are you going to do?  There could be a gun right there.  Your own gun could be in your head.  You have a bathroom in the bedroom, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what?  Bathroom in the bedroom.  I was ready to say, you know, it's just fear, culture of fear.  You're not helping matters, Anthony, because odds are you can leave your doors unlocked  in Nassau County and nothing's going to happen to you.  No.  Don't.  That's the reality.  But then you just said and reminded me of the time that a black gentleman was inches 
[01:34:30]  from my head.  Right.  The scariest day of my life.  Thought you were a chick.  They thought I was a chick.  And there was a rapist going around, and thank God you rolled over and said, hey.  Holy shit.  See?  That was the scariest day of my life.  I was living in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Yeah, I crashed in my brownstone.  I had never locked my door.  I was on like the third or fourth floor.  How do you not lock the door?  I think it was the third floor.  Oh, okay.  And down a dark hallway, so I'm thinking, who would ever come down here? 
[01:35:00]  And I wasn't thinking.  I just closed the door, and I'm taking a nap during the day, because I did overnights,  and some douchebag was moving out of the building, and it had the doors propped open.  Oh, boy.  Because we had really good security.  It was, you know, two doors you had to get through.  So, but they had them open, because they were, you know, they were loading their U-Haul.  Yep.  And all I remember is waking up, because I just felt the presence in my room.  There was a black gentleman in a hooded sweatshirt, pulled down very tight.  I saw his eyes.  He was literally two inches from my face, staring at me. 
[01:35:30]  And the only thing I could figure, because what Anthony said, there was a rapist loose  in the area.  The news was doing reports on this at the time.  And I'm like, holy shit, that was the rapist, and he was looking to see if I was a chick.  Wow.  Turned out he never took anything, because I opened my eyes.  I didn't move, because I'm like, if I move, he might think, who knows what he's going to  think.  I'm going to go after him.  So I just opened my eyes.  I was in the worst position to defend myself.  Worst position.  Right.  He'd had a cock full of marshmallow.  And his black dick in your ass. 
[01:36:00]  It would look like one of those little snacks they sell, like a marshmallow type of, you  put your chocolate in my marshmallow.  Jesus.  Sorry.  I couldn't think of a good, I don't know what marshmallow candy bars are.  A little snack.  Yeah.  This was a very, very scary day for me.  I apologize.  I apologize.  And, yeah, they were doing stories on the news, and it turned out that he was looking  to see if I was a chick.  So I opened my eyes, and I just, the only thing I could say, because I just woke up, 
[01:36:30]  I'm like, what are you doing here?  Yeah.  That's all I could think of.  Oops.  He must have been like, oh, jeez.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I guess he realized I wasn't a chick.  This is the only thing I could figure out.  And he bolted.  He just ran.  And he never took anything.  He could have taken anything he wanted from the apartment, because I was asleep.  I don't care if shit like that happens once, 20 times.  And really fast, I had a shelf right next to the door where I would just throw my  keys in my wallet.  It was an easy place.  Boom.  Throw it right there.  He didn't even take that on the way in or out, which was the easiest thing he could  have done.  But then again, I didn't have cash on me. 
[01:37:00]  I never had cash on me.  No.  So now I guess I'm with you, Anthony, because I forgot about that.  If it happens once or 25 times in your neighborhood, I don't care.  And then you look at statistics and that.  But, you know, even the person that got tied up and smacked around, same stats right there.  And they got it.  Yeah.  So call me crazy.  Why don't you just sleep in Scarface's office?  That's what I'm building my house up.  You have all, like, monitors and cameras?  That's what I'm going to be like. 
[01:37:30]  In case the fucking Diaz brothers come for you?  Dude, this ass is going to have motion detectors and everything.  You watch.  Six months down the road, the ass is going to say, I got my motion detectors in.  I finally got my cameras installed.  And I love, like, monitors all over the place in the bedroom.  What's that?  What's the use of having the bedroom door locked, though, if you don't know what's going  on outside?  Like, you don't know somebody's outside.  You might as well get some kind of a camera.  You don't need a bunch.  Maybe one that focuses on the outside of your bedroom door.  Well, a camera outside the bedroom door.  That's pretty good. 
[01:38:00]  I like the way you think.  Yeah, because they could just be, you know, sitting and waiting for you to wake up.  Could just be.  The worst fear I have is that, not even that it would be a criminal.  Show prep?  Yeah, show prep.  That Anthony's going to wake up, and there's going to be a radio producer there going, we  got nothing.  We're on in one minute.  It's not even the crook that comes in, because, you know, you blast one of them. 
[01:38:30]  Who cares?  It's, you ever hear about the cases of mistaken identity when the police charge in on a search  warrant on the wrong house, and they break in to arrest somebody?  You never heard of that in the middle of the night?  Yeah, sure.  It's like, I would be so scared I'm going to shoot a cop that's coming in by mistake.  Because they come, you know, it's the middle of the night.  It's not like I'm expecting anybody, you know, in the middle of the night. 
[01:39:00]  You're insane.  And that, like, would be, you know, some kind of mistaken identity thing.  Search warrants in your neighborhood?  You're insane.  Maybe a doctor on a malpractice suit that he's answering.  Serving a warrant.  Do you hear this kook?  He's just losing his mind.  Here's the difference.  Someone has to say it.  When there's a criminal, he's creeping around.  A criminal doesn't break in with 15 French young,  Freeze!  Police!  Freeze!  Police!  That's an indicator that it's not a home invasion.  What a good way to keep from getting shot.  And that's the story that kind of got us started on this, which we were going to talk about 
[01:39:30]  after the commercial break we were going to take 15 minutes ago.  Well.  The fireman rapist.  Yeah.  You know what?  We could do it right now.  Fuck it.  But it does keep you from getting shot, but it also wakes up the neighborhood at four  in the morning.  Nobody, no criminal.  Plus, you'll know the difference.  You know, Freeze!  Police!  You know, the accent.  It's very scary, though, when you...  Things like sliding glass doors petrify me.  I have them, and they petrify me.  You lock them, right, with the big bar?  I lock them with that.  I got a bolt thing on the top, the bar on the bottom. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, they're all the...  But it's a big chunk of glass.  So what?  You just throw a barbecue through it, and you're in...  What kind of an alarm do you got?  They could cut a hole...  I mean, you have an alarm.  Because they could cut a hole, a round hole in the glass and get through that way.  No, they don't do that.  That whole full security stuff makes me laugh, because if you're a robber, you're just going  to take a rock and knock it through.  You knock it through.  Especially if you know that there's no...  The alarm goes off fine.  You're in and out before the cops even get there.  Although...  If you know what you're doing, you're in and out of a house. 
[01:40:30]  You're not there trying to get the paintings off the walls, you know, creeping down like  on the Tom Cruise Emission Impossible gear.  You're going in.  As a crook, you kind of know where most people keep money.  Right.  Jewelry.  Yeah.  And that's what you're looking for.  And you could grab it and be gone in a matter of minutes.  Definitely.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dean.  Dean, you got something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys really need to get that audio of Imus.  Yeah.  Bartlett fucking killed.  He wished Jimmy a happy birthday. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, my God.  He did a hoo-hoo robin.  He made a comment about how Stern invented toilet paper in houses.  Yeah.  And houses.  All right.  Listen.  We're going to get that audio in a few minutes.  We'll probably have it after the break.  Hey, Jim.  Your HBO special just fucking rocked, man.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  I appreciate that.  I thought he was going to try to get you.  Yeah, the HBO special did rock.  Thank you.  People are suggesting that I install a moat and a drawbridge to keep in the spirit of my outfit. 
[01:41:30]  See, I live in a building with a doorman and with security because I get nervous about that exact same thing.  I'm paranoid, but I mean, I got people there that are there 24 hours.  You are somewhat safer in an apartment building, depending on what apartment it is.  When I was living in Brooklyn in an apartment, I didn't feel very safe in there.  Because you had, like, two keys to get in, right?  But, like, if someone leaves the door open, they're all figures.  Yeah, it's two keys, but, yeah, they were always propped open.  The doorman was like some fidget you could have taken out with nothing. 
[01:42:00]  And it's just creepy.  We talked about, you know, the stairwells when the elevator's broken.  And you just hear...  Up those stairs, those echoey stairs.  And you look up and there's someone up there.  Now you don't go.  You've got to wait for them to leave.  I've got to piss.  I'm not going to walk past them. 
[01:42:30]  Crack you in the head.  Hi, do you know which apartment?  Boom!  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  That's it.  Next thing you know, it was July, and now I'm hearing Christmas music.  You're in a hospital.  In a hospital with smiling loved ones around going...  Dude, I knew it.  What are we going to do with all these flowers?  What was the last thing around?  I was in a stairwell.  The elevator was broke.  It was a hot day.  And you look out the window.  Sparkling blue and green red lights. 
[01:43:00]  Why is mommy wearing a winter coat?  What?  It was warm.  I was in the stairwell.  I echo.  I remember the echo.  It was a guy at the top of the stairs.  He asked me a question.  And now it's Christmas.  And I remember saying, uh...  Yeah, I turned my head and went, I think that's 6A, and now I'm here.  What happened? 
[01:43:30]  All right.  By the way, do you know how to get around that, by the way?  If you're scared about walking up the steps, do what I do.  Yeah.  I had that once during the blackout.  As I'm walking up the steps, I just start singing, I'm a policeman on my way home from work.  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  And they hear that.  There's musicals in your head.  Well, it's natural.  That's probably what you do if you're a cop.  You have to act like a cop so they don't bother you.  That's just me.  I used to have to walk home from my job washing dishes many moons ago as a tot.  I was like, I guess, early 20s.  Did you finally just throw the apron at the guy when Omar recruited you to get some cocaine from Hector? 
[01:44:00]  I watched your own dishes.  And I'd walk home, and it was 3 in the morning, and there'd be ruffians in the neighborhood.  Young ruffians.  Jesus.  And that's the language I use.  Were you coming home from a Vic Morrow play?  Wow.  And whenever I'd see him coming down the street, and I was walking, I would start just talking to myself all loud.  And say things like, you motherfucker! 
[01:44:30]  Fucking!  I don't need that kind of shit.  Like that.  Like, you got crazy.  You got to act like the crazy guy.  Who was on the corner?  James Lipton?  You were afraid he was going to bother you?  Confuse you with someone who could have any actual ability whatsoever?  That's the worst crazy guy impression I've ever heard.  I didn't say it was good.  I was young and silly.  Why don't you just throw your hands up like Charles Nelson Reilly and go,  Ah, I'm a crazy person!  Cha-cha-cha!  Oh!  Don't tangle with me, bustler! 
[01:45:00]  Get away from me!  I'm nuts!  I'll hit you with my ass, Scott!  Crazy people never think they're crazy.  That's what you never say.  I know!  If you try to play crazy, you always act like you're completely sane and tell the person.  I was young.  What did I know?  All right.  We should break.  Our bladders need a break.  I'll say.  When we get back, the fake firefighter story, which is another thing that we've got to deal with that I don't know how to defend.  And in front of me, the Imus audio. 
[01:45:30]  Imus.  Rob Bartlett doing his Brian Wilson impression and just plugging the show like crazy.  We'll get that audio on after the break, okay?  Oh, stupid.  Wow, across America.  True tales from the road.  Real evil.  Real stories.  Real rules.  I just got wowed by an old Guatemalan lady with an appendix scar and a meat pack.  It's just back to the lot.  Yeah, I just got wowed in Oklahoma by a girl and a green-dye figure. 
[01:46:00]  Woo!  And some big old round fur bun bags with big old turkey nipples.  What's up, b-b-b-boys in Chicago representing?  Hey, boys.  I'm driving along here on the Eisenhower 290 West.  It's 822 Central Time in the morning.  I just put my wowed sticker on last night, and I just got flashed some dee-dee-dee-dee-licious boobies.  It was, I don't know what she looked like.  She was hot, hot, hot. 
[01:46:30]  That's it, boys.  The first one I've seen in Chicago.  Hope to keep them coming.  Thanks, boys.  Love you.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony Wow Line, 866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  Very proud of my big tip.  That's right. 
[01:47:00]  I will be taking a meeting with one of our archenemies in the very near future.  People are trying to figure out who this archenemy is.  It will be revealed.  I don't know how this will ever work, but we'll at least have an open mind and at least get a free lunch out of it. 
[01:47:30]  I'm hungry.  But I think it would be smart to at least listen.  Why not?  It doesn't hurt to listen, right?  Good point.  We'll see what happens.  It's going to be very interesting.  A lot of people are, well, one guy.  What? 
[01:48:00]  Agreeing with me about being afraid of a cop coming in and shooting them.  Another guy is all worried and buying all kinds of alarm equipment and guns and wireless video cameras.  You can get a pair for $25.  Has night vision built in.  They rig right up to a TV.  They work great, and they're tiny.  Who was the guy who was agreeing with you about the cop shooting them?  Was it Old Dirty at Yahoo?  Fear Cells.  Fear Cells. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Scary stuff out there.  They're doing gangbuster business.  Yeah.  You want to hear Rob Bartlett first?  Oh, of course.  All right, so Rob Bartlett on Imus as the Brian Wilson character.  Once again, you've got to thank Imus.  Helping the cause.  By the way, since we rebuild our careers here.  Yes, Jimmy Norton.  So Rob Bartlett, I didn't know, was apparently in the Odd Couple play. 
[01:49:00]  What do you think the odds are that maybe, you know, we can go see the play?  I would go.  I would too.  Absolutely.  That would be great.  Taking a show with Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm a good show guy to go with.  Wear tuxedos?  No.  You should see me and that fucking creep Steve just sitting there eating Twizzlers.  Really uncomfortable.  Were you like, did you go in a Motorhead shirt or something?  Yeah.  You people have ruined Broadway.  Oh, please.  In the afternoon, they're lucky we showed up. 
[01:49:30]  People like you.  People like you.  You should still be going with top hats on.  And canes.  That fucking sociopath just sitting there with his big dumb boots and his fucking 30 rings.  Eating at Twizzlers.  You know, you ruin it, though.  Some of you guys ruin the experience for people that want to make a real night of it.  And like, I'm just talking about people that want to maybe get dressed up like it's a real  night out.  Take a limo into the city.  Catch a show.  Nice dinner somewhere.  And there's just some slob sitting in a goddamn Black Sabbath t-shirt eating Twizzlers like 
[01:50:00]  he's at the fucking movie matinee.  I'm watching a Schwarzenegger movie.  You know what?  Well, I also ruin people's nights out who decide they want to go see some stand-up comedy.  So fuck them.  That's that big night out.  Take your awful wife somewhere else.  Sorry.  Are you suffering from amnesia?  Why?  I don't know.  I think you feel like we're all supposed to be living like it's the turn of the 20th century. 
[01:50:30]  The good old days, as I like to refer to them.  You want it to be 1917.  1917.  No, I just like a bit of a nostalgia ability.  I like a bit of, you know, people, people acting accordingly.  That's all.  All right.  Why don't we play this audio of Rob Bartlett on Imus?  Once again, thank you to our friend Don Imus for helping the cause today.  Wait, hold on, Eric.  Why'd you give me the number of tickets for Rob Bartlett? 
[01:51:00]  I was hoping that we, you know, get one on the arm.  Oh, my God.  You don't want to pay for tickets.  God forbid we pay for something.  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying to say.  All right.  Here we go.  Rob Bartlett.  Please welcome to the program Brian Wilson.  Good morning, Brian.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  And hi, all you whack bags in cyberspace.  Congratulations on your first anniversary on XM.  O and A, party rock. 
[01:51:30]  Now, I know that the first anniversary symbol is supposed to be paper.  And I was going to give you each a roll, but I used it all on Halloween, TPing Howard Stern's house.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  I invented that.  Tell them, Fred.  Wow, man. 
[01:52:00]  That is fantastic.  The only person that doesn't realize that Howard Stern's a joke is Howard Stern.  Tell them, Fred.  He's become a one big joke.  Oh, crap.  Is that good?  And then at the end of the segment, he did this for us today on Don Imus on MSNBC.  So be safe this flu season.  Get a shot.  Stay away from Popeyes.  And don't handle your bird if it's infected.  You really shouldn't handle your bird anyway, Opie, because, you know, it can make you go blind. 
[01:52:30]  Or at least grow hair on your palms.  Right, Anthony?  Right, Brian.  Right.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  What the hell is wrong with it?  27.  Up to the hour.  How happy that makes me.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  I guess that bit's back, isn't it, there, Opie?  I guess so.  I guess they have a little bigger audience than us.  All right, bit is back on.  Fuck. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, good, revived.  That is funny.  Bravo.  I guess they win, I guess Bartlett's in the lead for the Assault on the Media contest for November.  How about we send them some sort of a nice...  My fire zone?  I think the entire Imus...  I believe Rob Bartlett's already listening.  Obviously.  I don't know, I wouldn't say that.  I don't think Imus is listening, though.  You can't be bothered with other radio shows.  Busy man. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  I say that they get my fires.  That's great.  No, I don't want people to dress like they did when me and Groucho used to hang out.  Yeah, we'll do that in a sec.  We've got to announce the winner of the Assault on the Media contest for October.  But we promised the fake firefighter rapist story.  Scary.  This is unbelievable.  You made a great point about this in the office, Anthony.  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  How do you combat this one?  You can't. 
[01:54:00]  They're getting too smart out there.  Tricky.  And here at home, a manhunt continues for a fake firefighter in the city.  Police say he used the disguise in an elaborate plan to sexually attack a woman.  Fox 5's Catherine Craig covering this story in Chelsea this morning.  Catherine, what's the latest word?  Well, Lucy, we know investigators have been talking with a victim, and residents living  around this Chelsea neighborhood are wondering if the suspect specifically targeted this young  woman.  He apparently knew exactly where to go.  He knew she would be alone, and he devised this frightening scheme to get into her apartment. 
[01:54:30]  Someone posed as a fireman and getting in.  Somebody was out for her.  It's a terrifying sex attack that has police searching for a man who dressed up like a firefighter.  There's been nothing but detectives crawling in the building.  Sources tell Fox 5 it started when the man lit two small fires in this Chelsea building,  then knocked on a woman's apartment door.  Detectives say he was wearing a firefighter's mask and was so convincing she came out of her 
[01:55:00]  apartment.  That's when he allegedly pushed her back in, pulled out a gun, and sexually abused her.  It all happened while real firefighters were putting out the flames.  All these fire trucks rolled up.  I mean, at least five of them.  We opened the door and there were firemen coming up the stairs.  And police right now don't have a good description of this suspect, mainly because he had this  gas mask on.  You are asked to call Crimestoppers, though, at 1-800-577-TIPS.  You have information that could help police. 
[01:55:30]  Wow.  They actually lit a fire.  Lit the fire.  And then you knock on the door, and you're dressed as a fireman.  In that case, you're not going to say, well, can I see some credentials?  You know, there's flames behind him.  He probably lights it, like, right behind him.  Yeah.  Excuse me, look.  So even if you look through the peephole, it's like, holy shit, there's a fire and a fireman.  He's got a lighter next to his head.  Oh, man, you want to come out?  Yeah.  And then, you know, what are you supposed to do? 
[01:56:00]  Not think that it's actually a fireman?  And then there's real firemen on the scene.  They come to put the fire out.  So perhaps you're even hearing sirens.  How do you combat that one?  How?  You don't.  You think there's a moment of clarity when you open the door and you go, say, this fireman's  not wearing pants, and the guy had some kind of, like, gas mask type of thing on, so they're  never going to get this guy.  So that you don't get to see his face, and he comes in and sexually abuses her. 
[01:56:30]  But isn't there a better way to do it?  Like, isn't there a less elaborate plan to, like, can't you pose a UPS guy where you're  just going to show up in a brown hat or a box?  I don't know, UPS, though, you've got to have, what, some kind of electric clipboard?  What do you need?  What kind of, really, as far as UPS goes, maybe in suburban neighborhoods, you could  look out your window, and if you see a big UPS truck outside your house, odds are it's  a UPS guy.  That would be like an elaborate thing, a guy at his house painting this big truck brown 
[01:57:00]  and UPS on the side.  Logo doesn't look quite right.  Right.  You're looking out there going, it's sassy.  It doesn't have the right stencils to make it.  Yeah.  He used a five for the S backwards.  It's just a car with UPS on it.  Yeah.  Guy doesn't even want to go the distance and get the truck.  And, you know, that, I don't know.  In an apartment, though, yeah, there have been guys dressed like UPS that knock on the door  and look through the peephole and then open the door. 
[01:57:30]  You're done.  That's got to be an awful revelation, too.  Where's my package?  Oh, here it is.  It's like a gun in my face.  Oh.  Yuck.  Package in my pants.  Yeah.  And what do you do with the chain?  You got the stupid chain on the door?  Do those things work?  You kick that door with the chain and forget about it.  You're raping a girl with a big bloody lip with a big door mark halfway down her face  that she was looking out of that fucking bam-o. 
[01:58:00]  How many locks do you have on your door at this time, Anthony?  I only have two.  I have the deadbolt and the regular knob lock.  I'm picturing deadbolts from the ceiling to the floor.  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Cumbia, UPS.  My favorites are those ones in the city apartments.  It's a bar that goes from, like, just under the knob to about three feet away from the  door on the floor.  Sticks in some hole that you have to drill and put some metal plate on the floor. 
[01:58:30]  Those are, uh, that'll secure your door.  You need a big steel door.  I don't like, like, windows by the door, either.  Like, uh, nice decorative glass work that's either next to your door or in your door.  You got the four panes of glass.  How the hell would you do that?  It's decorative.  You put your hand through there.  But it's decorative.  There's the lock.  Chicka-chicka.  Dunski.  Let's say hi to Amy.  Amy! 
[01:59:00]  Hello.  What's up, Amy?  Morning, boys.  Love you, boys, by the way.  Thank you.  Big, big fan.  You're missing the better, creepier part of this story, that he spent the entire night,  he cooked himself a meal, and tried on all of her shoes.  Did he really?  This is the same guy?  Well, he probably couldn't leave as the firemen were there, and you know, they were probably  there for quite some time.  The meal, I understand.  The shoes, if he's raping her, I don't.  Did he use chloroform?  Are they saying that?  Yes.  Chloroform, nice. 
[01:59:30]  Yes.  Jesus.  Extremely creepy, yes.  I'm a city dweller, too, and very nice.  I'm thrilled.  So she was knocked out the whole time?  Basically.  Tied up and knocked out.  All right, Amy.  Thanks for that.  Did he hurt her, or no?  Thank you.  I don't know.  They said he assaulted her a little bit, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, to add insult to injury.  Well, love you very much, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Amy.  Bye.  How big were her feet?  Do they fit?  Fucking creepy, naked man with a fireman's mask and a fucking rag in his hand trying on  your shoes. 
[02:00:00]  It's lovely.  Hey, where's Martini Steve?  Did he have a good time at the party?  You could never tell with him.  No, he's just teetering.  I think he was, uh...  I think he was doing all right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did he do any Jaeger?  I don't know what he did.  What else did?  He was very quiet, I noticed.  Here comes Steve.  Steve, did you have fun at the party?  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  I was more restrained than I usually was, just because I knew we had to...  Ben and I were going to be running around working and stuff like that. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  But, uh, you know, and as I saw some of the other guys drinking, I just knew that I had  to sort of hold back.  Oh, you had to be the guy?  You had to be the guy?  I didn't...  You know what?  We are in trouble.  What?  This organization is in deep trouble.  That you're the voice of reason.  You're the guy that decided not to drink as much.  I've had too many episodes in the past.  I don't want to call anybody out, because I've had too many of those episodes in the  past where I've been the drunk asshole.  So...  Did you have any, uh, Jaeger?  Um, I had one shot of Jaeger.  Oh, one?  And then I was drinking beers.  And then...  Beers.  ...I felt myself starting to, starting to, like, list to one side, and that's when I 
[02:01:00]  hit the soda.  And that's when I started to pull myself out of it.  Yeah.  Erected perfectly.  Yeah.  Perfectly.  He's standing perfectly straight, and just his head kind of bobbling back.  Is that what happened?  He's moving.  He's moving.  I didn't even notice.  I didn't realize I did.  Yeah.  Out of another club soda, please.  Yeah.  What's this audio of this Illinois, uh, cop?  That was, uh, sent overnight by, uh, I guess one of the guys he used to work with.  Guy just decided he didn't want to be a cop anymore, and this was his sign-off over the,  uh, police radio.  He said, you know, gave his notice, and this was the final thing he said on the police radio as 
[02:01:30]  he, uh, you know, left the job.  Second, 2-29.  3-29.  10-42.  Thank you for everything.  Your mom's box.  10-4.  Good luck.  Yeah.  He quit by saying your mom's box?  Yeah, he did.  A legendary sign-off?  That is the sign-off.  That's the sign-off when, uh, not coming back.  When you're done with this radio show.  He's got to be a fan of the program, huh? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  Is that what they do when they're quitting and stuff?  They give them one last thing on the police radio?  I don't know.  That's the first one I've ever heard.  It doesn't sound very formal.  Like, it's just something they allow you to do as long as you're just, you know.  Maybe.  You're not in trouble and you're just quitting the job.  Maybe he just blurted it out.  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  Good luck.  I've got to hear that again.  Second, 2-29.  8-29.  10-42.  Thank you for everything.  Your mom's box. 
[02:02:30]  10-4.  Good luck.  10-4.  10-4.  Your mom's box.  Good luck.  10-4.  Investigating some mother's box.  What's the call they're on?  Some mother in a box.  Is it all out police pursuit because that means something else?  Yeah.  That went from, uh, wow, 19, uh, what is this, 85?  Around there?  Uh, Challenger, you have go for throttle up.  Your mom's box.  Oh, wow.  Too soon?  All right.  1985. 
[02:03:00]  Was it 85?  I hope it was.  No.  It was 86.  Well, actually, it was, uh, 85 going into 86.  I was in rehab, so it was January of 86.  January of 86.  Yeah, I know it was somewhere around there.  Close enough, though.  The dates don't all have to be accurate here on the program, I think, for a few chuckles.  I think they'll give us a little leeway.  We got the Hanson brothers coming in today?  No, the Hanson brothers are the hockey players.  Hanson triplets.  This is Hanson.  Yeah.  But they're all Hansons.  So they're the Hanson brothers. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, but if you talk about the Hanson brothers, then everyone thinks of the movie Slapshot and thinks of the hockey players.  We're talking about the Mbop guys.  Which I'm sure they love being referred to as.  All right, look, there's three of them.  There's three of us.  I got dibs on Taylor.  You guys fight over Zach and Isaac.  Holy crap.  What are we going to talk to these guys about?  Well, I'm sure they're still recording music. 
[02:04:00]  What is this?  Mbop.  Oh, is this?  Eric's done that quickly.  This is how long ago?  Hold on.  This is the...  This is 97?  It had to be around 97, right?  I'm trying to hear the words.  This is Monet.  I love this better when it was called the Jackson 5.  My voice was pretty high back then. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I think back to its memories.  Yeah.  Sure.  That band door closing.  Where's your...  Oh, my God.  They must hate this. 
[02:05:00]  What?  How about the cast keeps rolling in?  Yeah.  Are you liking it, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I hear a sound.  I suddenly realize that I'm going to have to get my group photo the moment they come in.  Hey, uh...  If Disturbed wants to impress me, remake that one.  Exactly.  Come on.  They did land a computer.  I know, and they did a good job.  I want to hear them do that.  Who got us this guest?  I'm just...  Where's the booker?  I might even ask you to be a smartass or to be negative.  I'm just curious. 
[02:05:30]  I don't know.  We were going on vacation, so we said yes to everything, because we just didn't want  to be bothered.  And now this is what we have to deal with after vacation.  Let me just throw out a little thing.  Hey, Ben, you might want to lower the office window curtain.  All right, just keep it like that for now.  The best of Hanson.  The best of Hanson.  I will give someone $100 right now if they can name one more Hanson song.  Hawk?  Except for Faggy over here. 
[02:06:00]  That was actually played out of his iPod.  I would bet money that Eric would be the only one that would come up with another Hanson  song.  What's another one?  Eric has a music knowledge.  It's pretty impressive.  Don't look.  You looked.  No, I didn't.  Did they have another hit?  Yeah.  What was it?  Where's the Love?  Where's the Love?  How's it going?  How did that one?  You do know.  No, I don't know that one.  I just remember the title.  The best of Hanson.  Where is it?  Are they going to have Oom Bop, I don't know, on the CD five times? 
[02:06:30]  You know, there's probably a lot more Hanson than we...  How many albums did they put out?  I didn't even know.  Well, you know what, guys?  Let's not be nutty.  These are the things that we should be asking them.  No, didn't they have a strict Christian upbringing?  Yes, they did.  They did?  And Taylor married the first girl a fan?  Fan.  I like that.  How old were his fans?  Like 14?  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll do something with Hanson.  They're coming in at 10.30 or so. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, cool.  Best of Hanson.  They used to tour with their parents.  I remember that.  Because I worked at a Hanson show in Boston.  You worked at a Hanson show?  Well, they're some common ground.  Well, they're some security-intensive jobs.  But, I mean, they tour with their parents, this whole big family, whatever, bus.  And there's mobs of 13-year-olds.  I don't know if that's still the case, but...  Hi, do you remember me?  I was at your show at the Twitter Center.  I was the one yelling Isaac and crying.  Never volunteer information. 
[02:07:30]  Just shut the fuck up.  You can punch him any time, Steve.  No, but then he'll be dead, and there's just a part of Jimmy I love.  I don't want to get punched.  Mbop.  Yes, it's true.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Well, we have that to look forward to today.  What was the other song?  Derek?  Yeah, the other one.  Where's the love?  I at least wanted a piece of it.  Why? 
[02:08:00]  Sounds like Mbop, Fast Motion.  Oh, that was it.  Now we're talking...  Do you remember dancing around to this one?  I certainly do.  At Axis, or where were you?  Uh, the Mamakins.  Mamakins.  I remember this one.  Yeah.  All right.  I didn't remember that one.  Maybe I needed a little more.  No, you didn't.  But I like Where's the Love.  You hate it.  I don't, Opie. 
[02:08:30]  You don't love love.  I do.  You hate love.  I like love.  Love doesn't like you.  Love loves me.  Love hates you.  Love likes me.  Love finds me fun to toy with.  You can have an OCD face-off, no problem.  No, there's only so many options you could have.  I know.  Didn't Jay Moore want to have sex with little Zach?  Yeah.  He used to talk about...  Was it Zach?  The drummer.  Yeah, no one.  The little drummer.  No one ever wanted Isaac. 
[02:09:00]  Actually, Isaac, as I recall on the show a couple of times, somebody may have called him  the Frankenhansen.  Well, I might have to remind Isaac who that person was when he comes in here.  Who was it?  I'm looking at him right now.  He's Jimmy.  He's the person that is turning into a creep in front of our eyes.  Yes, you are.  Um-bop, Lily.  Um-bop, Lily.  Well, it's just you have little Zach on the drums and cute Taylor singing. 
[02:09:30]  Um-bop, Lily.  And then Isaac was like the older one already.  And he would play guitar and it just kind of didn't fit.  And he was just like, Grandpa, get me the guitar.  Um-bop, bop, bop.  Um-bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Taylor gets down from that tree immediately.  Grandpa, Grandpa, we're doing um-bop again.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Are you trying to say he had kind of a square face? 
[02:10:00]  Well, it was sort of, you know, if any of the three Hanson boys had to be Frank and Hanson,  I think it would have been Isaac.  Will we play um-bop again tonight?  No, no, no, no.  I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't.  Dust comes out of the stage.  His big oversized shoes, boots, whatever the hell he wore.  Yeah.  He would like tune up his guitar and then also turn the bolts on his neck. 
[02:10:30]  This reminds me of something Daryl was talking about last night.  I don't know.  My brother Darren, whose new name is Daryl.  Daryl.  That's a drunken night when people change your name.  But my brother Darren was talking about the time he went down to spring break.  Yeah.  Ah.  The modern English.  Modern English with all melts for you.  Yes.  You might remember that finely crafted pop tune.  Of course.  From the 80s.  They were opening for the fix in Fort Lauderdale on the beach. 
[02:11:00]  The fix.  The fix.  Who had their fair share.  Oh.  Well, they had a bunch of hits.  Yeah, they lasted.  Modern English, you know, they'll try to tell you they had more hits besides I'll melt with you.  No, but they just didn't.  Beach full of people, thousands of people just waiting.  Play I'll melt for you.  Right.  Enough of this other crap.  All they want to hear.  They play it.  Finally.  The place going crazy, going nuts.  There it is.  Nice.  Here's me on the beach.  Trying to get some puss and getting nothing. 
[02:11:30]  And the song ends.  They start playing other hits or whatever it was they had.  People doing nothing.  Just like, what the fuck?  Get to the fix.  So what do they do?  They play it again.  Oh, man.  But wait.  It gets even better.  No way.  The song ends and frenzied crowd still waiting for the fix to come on.  They come on for a pseudo-encore.  And what do they play? 
[02:12:00]  I'll melt for you.  For the third time in the same half-hour concert.  There are so many bands that do that.  They'll start the show with the hit.  And then that's all they really have.  So then at the end of their set, they'll play it again, thinking maybe people forgot or they came late to the venue.  Wow.  You have that lead singer with his gay hat, you know, just dancing around.  Like, oh, please.  Three times.  Three times.  There is no fucking need for that. 
[02:12:30]  The last time, they changed the tempo a little bit.  Like, ooh, let's throw them a little curve.  Play a little reggae or something.  A little slower.  Please remind the little Hanson of how Jay Moore called him Chaka from Land of the Lost.  Chaka.  Chaka.  Ooh.  Wow.  Some really nasty things were said about the Hanson boys.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to announce the winner of the Assault on the Media contest for October.  Mm-hmm.  Did Sonny Farrelly pull it out in the end? 
[02:13:00]  I couldn't tell you.  I haven't read any of his emails because I banned him.  There's a brand new one that happened Halloween night in Boston.  I didn't.  And we'll play that one for everybody, and then we'll decide who had the best Assault on the Media for the month of October.  It's a mountain one stand.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  This is what it's all about.  It's a mountain one stand.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I love this.  Show us a piece.  Wow.  He showed 36 double D. 
[02:13:30]  He showed 36 double D.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D.  He showed 36 double D.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  She just will park down.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Park down.  She just will park down.  Anywhere.  With the Mount Wednesday.  She'll flash it.  She'll flash it.  She'll flash it.  Babe, I'm all for it.  She'll flash it.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  Breast. 
[02:14:00]  This is what it's all about.  Oh, I love this.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out.  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic. 
[02:14:30]  Wow, this is wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Kick your frog and kick it off now.  This is wild, we're all here.  This is wild.  Wow. 
[02:15:00]  This is wild.  This is wild.  This is wild.  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  Well, congratulations to Denver.  I'll say that first.  Denver?  Denver voters have passed a measure that makes it legal for residents over 21 to possess up to an ounce of marijuana. 
[02:16:00]  Wow.  How about that?  Residents.  So I guess you, does that mean you can't be like some guy traveling through or something?  It says residents of Denver, Colorado can possess up to an ounce of pot.  Isn't that a lot?  Yeah, an ounce is a lot.  An O.Z., man.  It's like a four-finger lid.  That can't be real.  It's on Channel 9 News, the NBC affiliate. 
[02:16:30]  Why would they allow that?  They voted, let's see, the measure known as initiated question 100 was leading by a margin of 53 to 47 with 96% of the votes tabulated.  Opponents said they will have no practical effect because it will be trumped by Colorado state law.  Hmm.  So it's local, what, Denver law?  But the Colorado state law overrides it? 
[02:17:00]  What the fuck are these politicians doing?  So they say you can, but if you do, you're going to get arrested because the state of Colorado says you can't?  Oh, I don't know.  It's all just so confusing to me.  Unbelievable.  So it was passed, but...  But the state, yeah, could get in the way.  This is what's wrong with the way our politics work.  Unbelievable.  But, yeah, I found that on Fark, but I like Fark's headline over here about that show, Over There. 
[02:17:30]  It's that FX show about the war going on in Iraq.  It says, a Hollywood's graphic TV show, Over There, on FX, shut down after only 13 weeks on the air.  Meanwhile, the real Over There will continue its third season despite low ratings, graphic content, and crappy acting in D.C.  Wow.  That is a damn shame.  Yep.  I love that.  Fark.com. 
[02:18:00]  That's where I get my news.  There's a live fire in Chelsea, and they're doing live reports right now.  Sure it's not a rape?  I kind of know where that is, too.  Going on.  Oh, Ben was like, that's my house, dude.  No, but there's a walkway over the road in between the two buildings.  Oh, yeah, they just showed it.  That's in a parking garage?  Yeah.  At this point...  You just walk in with your ticket.  My car, please?  No problem.  At this point, every time I see a live shot, I'm just expecting an assault on the media. 
[02:18:30]  All right, we should get into the assault on the media thing.  Where's Sonny Ferrelli's last-minute entry?  Last minute.  Snuck it in under the wire.  Was it before midnight?  You think it's that one?  You sure?  Okay.  Thank you, Hawk.  Hawk, very excited.  He gets to find out who he goes to dinner with.  Oh, that's right.  He's part of the prize.  Who passes him up?  It's an option now.  Right.  It's an option, like you could put a checkmark whether you want to have him involved or not. 
[02:19:00]  Well, the winners have it.  Taxes.  Would you like to donate a dollar to the presidential re-election?  No.  Would you like Hawk on your dinner?  No.  You're the undercarriage wash at most, like, little...  Right.  You're going to want that true coat.  No.  The winners have an email and asking, do they have to, so now we're making it optional.  Yeah.  He's an option.  Poor E-Rock.  Gets no respect around here whatsoever. 
[02:19:30]  All right, so, this happened Halloween while we were at the Hard Rock Cafe, I guess.  Sonny Ferrelli hit Channel 4 reporter Bill Shields in Boston.  I guess he was doing a Halloween story or something like that.  Is the video up on opianthony.com and foundyourmusic.com?  I haven't seen the video yet.  I have not seen it yet.  I've heard the audio.  The audio is terrific.  Got to tell you, it's terrific.  It's terrific.  I don't know.  I don't really have the setup. 
[02:20:00]  I'd like to see the video.  All right, we'll play the audio here.  It's Sonny Ferrelli.  Lining it up for us.  On Halloween.  How do you like my getup?  Looks pretty good.  Very nice.  My friends are around here.  Everywhere here.  Salem is the place to be.  It's me and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Wow.  Hey, that's pretty good.  What a set of nuts.  That's great, isn't it?  The guy with a bullhorn.  Sonny Ferrelli. 
[02:20:30]  They were doing their dumb Halloween story in Salem, Massachusetts.  Did they give up?  Huh?  I got to see the video.  It sounds like he just gave up.  I think there was a little more to it than that.  But that's the clip we got.  Here it is again.  How do you like my getup?  Looks pretty good.  I've got my friends around here.  No, it's great.  That's the reporter, Bill Shields.  Yeah.  Talking back to the news.  People there saying, hey, how do you like my getup?  I guess he was dressed in some kind of costume.  He was probably in a costume, sure.  All goofy and stuff, and he got nailed bad.  All fun and games until you get the assault. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  Here's Sonny Ferrelli.  How do you like my getup?  Looks pretty good, huh?  It's very nice.  My friends are around here.  Everywhere here.  Salem is the place to be.  It's me and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  He's got the megaphone and everything.  Did they show him?  Oh, there he is.  You can see him.  Okay.  Now, it seems like they cut away from the video feed.  Did they?  Went to something else?  I'm going to have to watch the audio with the video. 
[02:21:30]  Yes.  Watch the audio.  Well, there he is.  You can't really see him.  We know it's him.  Yeah.  And then he realized he's not in the shot.  He comes back and makes sure that you can see him on his megaphone screaming, Opie and  Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Good job.  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Clear as a bell.  It's on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Sonny Ferrelli hitting Channel 4 up there in Boston on Halloween.  The reporter seems to have given up.  Well, let's play it again because you hear the reporter trying to talk over him. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, but he's got a bullhorn.  And then he gives up on the second saying of the thing.  How do you like my getup?  Looks pretty good.  I have my friends around here.  Everywhere here.  Salem is the place to be.  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  That's all right, Andy.  Just gave up.  He gave up and let him just say what he wanted to say.  He couldn't concentrate anymore.  The bullhorn rules.  Yeah.  The pest won.  Fast Freddy. 
[02:22:30]  Sonny wins.  Diction matched only by Steve.  Perfect.  Perfect.  It was a perfect Assault on the Media, Ant?  Yep.  What do you think?  That was.  Well, we had the whole gang around here vote on the winner of the Assault on the Media contest.  The prizes for October were pretty good, but we're still looking for better prizes, I got to tell you.  Yeah.  Always in search of better prizes.  The winner for October will win a MiFi.  Also, they will win a one-year free subscription for their new MiFi.  They also will win dinner with our own E-Rock at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in Little Italy. 
[02:23:00]  And then, in parentheses, it says E-Rock optional.  World Poker Tour Season 2 on DVD.  A Ministry of Sound Stick Axe music mixer.  And finally, admission to the Opie and Anthony Show Studios to watch the show live through a glass partition in a beekeeper outfit.  Beekeeper outfit optional.  Right.  So, there you have it.  And the contest for November starts up.  Immediately. 
[02:23:30]  And Rob Bartlett from Imus is in the lead.  Yeah.  Alright, so...  We have five.  Five that were in the running this month.  Actually, there were more than five, but these were the five best ones, Anthony.  We should play the ones that didn't make it.  E-Rock, how am I going to figure this out?  Help them.  E-Rock.  How am I going to figure this out?  Don't start thinking about what you're ordering at Paisano.  Yeah.  Huh?  You'll get nothing.  Oh, it goes this way?  Yeah.  Oh, you rock.  E-Rock rocks. 
[02:24:00]  Woof.  He sure does.  In fifth place, Anthony, the Assault on the Media Contest for October.  It was a story in Perth Amboy.  We don't know the pest's name, but he attacked ABC TV reporter Jeff Pegas.  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  Steve and Hawk are talking to each other.  Very important.  What happened?  Steve, yes?  All right, good.  You had that.  I just wanted to make sure you had that one.  Alrighty. 
[02:24:30]  Okay.  That's right.  Beat it, tight shirt.  Ow.  Sorry, Jimmy.  We can't all wear oversized shirts that, you know, mask our mushiness.  Wow.  He's hugging Jimmy and mushing his boobies.  Ew, you squeeze his man boob.  It's so squeezable, though.  You just went in for a little squeeze.  You got a little cup of a tight shirt you have on.  It certainly is.  It is good.  Here's fifth place.  All the videos are up on the website, Steve.  That's right. 
[02:25:00]  The search dogs actually missed the 10-year-old boy the first time they went by that house.  Don't know if that matters now.  He's a little dehydrated with a few cuts and bruises, but he'll be okay.  We're live in Perth Amboy tonight with some company.  Jeff Begay, Channel 7 Eyewitness News.  Everybody's celebrating out there.  Jeffrey, thank you.  Everybody's celebrating out there.  All right.  This one I liked a lot because they started a new trend where they tried to engage the reporter in conversation.  Yeah.  We kind of suggested that, and this guy took our suggestion and went with it.  And the reporter was so annoyed, he was actually pushing the pest out of the shot by the end of it. 
[02:25:30]  Very annoyed.  And then the newsreader back at the studio was like, everyone's celebrating out there.  Celebrating out there.  Trying to punt it off like he's just a drunk.  Right.  Can't acknowledge the fact that it's something much different than what he's trying to say it is.  So there you go.  That's fifth place.  We like that one a lot.  Fourth place, Anthony.  Poor Jim Dolan.  ABC 7 here in New York City.  The pest's name, Sock Stud Steve. 
[02:26:00]  S-O-C Stud Steve.  All right.  Would that be Sock?  Am I missing?  That guy's face in the shot.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you've seen that for the first time, Jimmy?  Yeah.  He's a dumb head.  He just pokes it in.  Yeah, the pest's just very subtle.  That was funny.  I liked how it was subtle, too.  He just pokes his face into the shot.  It's like, hey, are you listening to Opie Nett?  Just taking a little peek.  Just taking a little peek around.  A little peek around.  Hey, what are you doing here?  Hey.  What are you doing in this frame?  Hey.  That guy wanted to punch him so bad. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  Here's fourth place.  Hang on.  You might get up.  Looks pretty good, huh?  That would not be fourth place.  Opie.  That's the other one we just put.  Bill, this started in Iraq when three insurgents were captured by American authorities,  and one of them told the interrogators a story about a plan already in place, he said.  The plan explodes on the New York City subway system.  Now, that plan is already causing the mayor to ratchet up security and tell commuters to  watch out. 
[02:27:00]  Can you see the guy?  No.  No.  Just shouting?  Yeah, it's great.  He's just in the background yelling and screaming.  He's in the middle of the subway on the Upper West Side, and there's a black guy walking  by.  Oh, he is jumping.  Doing gang signs.  Yeah, he's jumping up and down, man.  He's jumping a little bit.  He made Jim Dolan look to his right.  So that was fourth place.  All right.  We're up to third place.  Third place winner for the Assault on the Media Contest for October.  He wins.  Does he win anything?  Do we know what he wins? 
[02:27:30]  He wins the knowledge that he came in third place.  That's it?  Is that it, really?  That's it.  A big hearty congrats.  That's all he gets.  What does he get?  There's nothing listed.  Nothing.  He gets nothing.  Oh.  Just the knowledge that he came in third place.  All right.  Third?  You'd think you'd get a ribbon.  Something.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That seat cushion.  What about one of those XM seat cushions for sporting events?  Right.  They're wafer thin.  Yeah.  You offer a thin seat cushion, sir? 
[02:28:00]  Wafer thin.  And, yeah, no surprise that we fucked up again.  Jesus.  These never go smoothly.  Our little countdowns.  Dude, this third place doesn't match up with this third place.  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Oh, my God.  Can't we get one thing right on the show?  No.  Never.  What's going on with this radio program?  Yeah.  See, that doesn't match.  See, that's different than that.  Will any meetings with arch enemies help things like this?  I will be taking a meeting very soon with an arch enemy. 
[02:28:30]  Wait.  I have no choice.  Can I guess?  I have no choice.  Mom, two films.  So what do we do?  What do we do?  Which third place?  Which third place?  I'd say one thing we do is we enjoy the laughter coming out of that booth.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you've never seen a happier group?  Yeah.  We've got to start micing that booth.  They love when it falls apart.  So we're all just going to...  Because it's Iraq's fault.  I guess we'll all just sit here and stare.  Iraq, any suggestions on what to do? 
[02:29:00]  This is the official third place?  Yeah.  But we already played that as fourth place.  Yeah.  Well, how did that happen?  We played this as fifth place, but it's third place up here.  You know, they're all winners.  Good point, Ed.  If you really think about it.  How about I do something really crazy and play no filter Pauls?  Uh-huh.  No filter Pauls.  Ah, here comes Steve's back.  Oh, Steve will straighten it out, Steve. 
[02:29:30]  All right, now we're going to get all straightened out.  Steve, we need your help.  Hey, buddy.  These are the actual winners, right?  Yeah, that's what you...  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, pop it down, Steve.  Sorry about that.  I don't know.  Just making sure you...  Okay, thank you.  Those...  Yeah, those top three are the ones that you asked for this morning.  You wanted first place, second place, third place.  I got that.  As we voted for them.  Those were the five finalists.  So...  So...  Third place?  Third place?  Third...  I'm sorry.  Third.  People get a little nervous when their jobs are on the line.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Not my fault at all.  Not taking place. 
[02:30:00]  That's what I was going to say.  Steve, give me a chair.  Yeah.  What I was going to say is Steve did it correctly.  Right.  Now I turn to my left and look at Iraq.  Oh, boy.  Iraq, what happened?  How did this get screwed up?  I thought that was the order that we...  Now, how would you think it's the order?  Did you just make it up in your head?  Or did you get an official document, like Steve got, that told you who was first, second,  and third?  Steve, who did it correctly.  Right.  That's right. 
[02:30:30]  Where did you get your information?  Based on that.  When I saw that, I thought that was the order.  Wait, no, you wrote that!  You wrote that!  You can't base the information on that piece of paper based on the piece of paper!  I didn't write that.  Where did that come from?  That was handed to me this morning, and I thought that was the order.  That came later.  What made you think that was the order?  Who handed that to you and said, here's the order?  Yeah.  Don't have an answer for that.  There you go.  I love when...  What soon to be headed over to a serious individual did that? 
[02:31:00]  They are all loving.  Holy crap.  I'm sorry, Hawk.  I just love when you're in this shit.  God, do they enjoy it.  Elo listens to every minute of this program.  Yeah.  A little communique to Elo.  I'm free for lunch.  Oh, no.  I don't even need to think about it anymore.  I'm free for lunch.  All right, so...  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Well, let's play Paul Fields.  No Filter Paul did not make the top three.  Oh.  No?  Oh, no.  He tried very hard.  So we'll play this, and then we'll figure the rest out.  I saw him yesterday.  He was complaining.  He was?  Why?  I don't know.  I think he knew.  This is No Filter Paul.  He sounded like a complete lunatic.  And he was the only assault on the media for October that was nationwide.  He hit Fox News.  Todd Conner joins us live from New York Times Square.  Todd?  Hey there, Greta. 
[02:32:00]  Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending his day defending his actions to make the threat public  and also to flood the city's subways with thousands of police officers and extra security saying  he would rather err on the side of caution.  Of course, nice subways also being rather cautious today.  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items.  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown.  It sounds like he's yelling and runs into a pole, doesn't it? 
[02:32:30]  Like, I always thought it kind of sounded like he got grabbed and pulled away,  but it sounds like he's running full speed trying to get into the frame and runs into a pole.  This contest is so weird because when that one hit, I was convinced no one was going to beat him.  Yep.  And pretty much three other guys beat him this month.  The other one that wasn't in the running.  Wow, am I confused.  Okay, I guess it was the one, the subway one we did before this.  That actually did not come in third place. 
[02:33:00]  That was out of the running as well.  So, all right, now I think we're on track here.  What contest is this?  Wait, but that one is...  Who the...  Holy...  What the...  Holy...  But...  Okay, all right.  Even though you heard this already, we're going to have to replay it.  This is third place.  Now we're set.  This is third place.  Paul's was fourth.  Well, we didn't pick fourth or fifth.  Oh, okay.  He was just out of the running, but he was one of the top five.  Sure.  All right, third place. 
[02:33:30]  Assault on the media contest for October.  It was this one.  We just played it, but let's play it again here.  The subtle approach.  The search dogs actually missed the 10-year-old boy the first time they went by that house.  Don't know if that matters now.  He's a little dehydrated with a few cuts and bruises, but he'll be okay.  We're live in Perth, Amboy, tonight with some company.  Jeff Begay, Channel 7 Eyewitness News.  Everybody's celebrating out there.  Jeffrey, thank you.  Now to us.  They're not celebrating.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony at all?  They're not celebrating. 
[02:34:00]  They're assaulting you, sir.  That's one of our pets.  They're all over the place.  All right, so that's third.  The runner-up, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  The runner-up for the Assault in the Media Contest for October.  Runner-up.  Runner-up.  Very excited.  Channel 7 here in New York again.  They got beat up this month.  Yeah, they're beat up.  They really did get beat up at Channel 7 in New York.  It was Joe Torres in New Jersey, and the pest's name is John from New Jersey. 
[02:34:30]  Second place.  Nathaniel, why the whisper?  Why the whisper is for you?  What's going on?  Let's get to the bottom of this right now.  Oh, no.  Dan?  Oh, boy.  I just was relaying an idea to help for the number one thing, to have a sound effect ready  for Anthony.  Oh, boy.  What sound effect?  What sound effect?  Which one, Dan?  Which sound effect would bring this whole thing together and make it even funnier?  There is none on the planet.  But we like to try here. 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  Derek suggested.  There goes the buck.  Derek suggested that we have the timpani ready.  Oh, the timpani that we always never have.  We're all just so excited right now when it's, um, yeah, we always, now Hawk will come over  here and, and just go through my, my stuff for, for, for an hour.  Hawk is now trying to find it.  And he'll look confused.  Like, Eric does, he just looks up and shakes his head like, gee whiz, what's going on? 
[02:35:30]  I was here a minute ago.  Oh, he's got it.  There it is right there.  I always say it.  He's good.  The one that looks like temp.  So, Ant's ready to play that for the winner of the Assault in the Media Contest.  All right.  But here's the runner-up.  What?  Too soon?  I think it's perfect.  What?  Too soon?  What happened?  All right, we ready?  Now.  Third place.  No, not yet? 
[02:36:00]  Do it again.  And now, the list of people keeping their jobs on the Opie and Anthony show are...  All right.  We're ready. 
[02:36:30]  Number one is...  What is...  No whammies, no whammies, no whammies.  Oh, we have plenty of whammies on this show.  We've got too many whammies on the board.  All right.  Here we go.  The runner-up for the Assault in the Media Contest for October.  Yes.  Channel 7 here in New York City.  Joe Torres.  And the pest, John from New Jersey.  Mother Nature's trifecta of high tides, steady winds, blowing rains, et cetera, forced this, 
[02:37:00]  the lake, to spill over on both sides.  And the result was...  Opie and Anthony, it's in satellite radio!  Opie and Anthony, it's in satellite radio!  Opie and Anthony, it's in satellite radio!  All right.  Why didn't that guy win?  That's a good one.  Wow.  What a silly goose he is.  He's all behind him.  Yeah.  He really should be shooting himself on a toilet.  Why didn't that guy win?  I'm looking at the video.  He's the guy that was fake pulling his hair out of his head.  Yeah.  Jumping up and down behind the reporter.  A genius.  Who didn't vote for this guy? 
[02:37:30]  You?  Hawk?  I didn't vote for him.  You didn't vote for him?  I completely disagree with the winner of the contest now.  Wow.  Completely.  We're going to have to step in.  Isn't that funny?  He's like fake pulling his hair out.  Are you guys hung over still?  That guy should have won.  In my opinion.  Uh-oh.  Controversy.  How is he listed on the big sheet?  He's in second place.  No.  What was it listed as?  Assault on the media?  Did it say anything?  No.  No. 
[02:38:00]  These guys watched all the videos, right?  Yeah.  They watched all the videos and then decided visually.  Didn't have any kind of, I don't know, America's Funniest Home Video thing.  And now, man, getting hit with golf ball.  Nothing like that in the list of, because I'm thinking he just kind of went, yeah, number  two.  Like when you voted.  Who voted for this guy?  Did you watch these before you voted?  Or is it based on memory?  Travis didn't watch?  Did you vote Travis? 
[02:38:30]  Oh, no.  Someone's got it.  See, that's why I'm thinking this just instead, it didn't get a guy, see, if it would have  been guy fake pulling hair out, assault, you'd go, oh, I remember that.  Yeah, it was funny.  If it's just Lock Arbor or whatever, what's that?  What's it called?  Lock Arbor.  Yeah, if it's just Lock Arbor, Channel 7, you're going to go, what the fuck is that?  This guy had perfect timing, too.  Listen to the timing again.  The reporter set him up perfectly. 
[02:39:00]  Mother Nature's trifecta of high tide, steady winds, blowing rains, et cetera, forced this,  the lake, to spill over on both sides.  And the result was evacuated.  The lake from Holmes, and also a nearby camera.  Perfect timing.  Clear as day.  And the visual is the guy pulling his hair out.  How did this guy lose?  Big fat kid jumping around behind him.  Yeah.  It's great.  Are we allowed to jump in here or no?  What are the official rules of the contest? 
[02:39:30]  I don't know.  Rules.  Travis, what were you going to say?  Yeah, what happened, Travis?  No, at like quarter to seven in the morning, Steve comes to me with the list.  Steve, let me say again, the buck just passed.  I like pointing out these subtleties to the listeners.  Whenever you hear any of the subordinates say another name, he is blaming that person.  So, like you heard Than say, well, Derek suggested the timpani.  He was saying so Derek could be blamed if it bombed.  Now, you just said, well, at a quarter to seven, Steve came in. 
[02:40:00]  Boom.  Steve.  Steve is now responsible.  All the shit's been taken off of you now.  That's right.  Way to take a chance, Travis.  The, what I did was I wrote, well, the list that you have in your hand of the five, I walked  around to everybody on the staff and said, who do you think should win?  And I ran down the list of assaults, assuming that everybody knew which one was which.  I don't know if you would know.  Let me say that list for a second.  Oh, my God.  But I did a complete description of which one. 
[02:40:30]  The voting is tainted.  We need to be tainted.  Well, last month, people actually had to look, you know, sit in front of a computer  and take a quick look.  No.  I won't read off the ones we haven't done yet, but, I mean, something like Perth Amboy  Pest.  See, why?  I'm operating a piece of everything.  ABC7 reporter Jim Dolan.  Who voted?  Everybody.  Everybody with the exception of the interns.  Who voted without seeing the videos?  Travis?  Eric?  Wait, you hadn't seen them? 
[02:41:00]  No, I've seen them, but not this morning.  They needed to see them this morning.  Oh, they all need to see them this morning.  See, that was what Ben and I were discussing back in the office.  We're like, do we want to send out the email?  Do we want to do this?  Do we just want to print it out and go around to everybody?  Last month, you just set it up at a computer, and, you know, people that work here, they  take five minutes.  I mean, each assault's only 15, 20 seconds long.  Oh, boy.  How tough could it be to look at five, six videos real fast?  Bad voting system. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Bad voting system.  No, no, no.  I'm not shirking blame if it's my fault for not assuming that these guys all know that  the assaults are.  I have to step in.  These guys work way too hard as pests out there.  Okay.  There's pride, there's honor, there's, like, bragging rights.  I mean, these people become instant celebrities, and we're just kind of like, ah, I think I  remember that one.  I'll vote for that one.  No way.  Fucking Iraqis are doing a better job of getting a vote across than this radio program. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Crush.  And what do you think?  Yeah, I think the voting was screwed.  Break out!  Screw it.  Break out!  Can we do that?  We got some hanging chads.  Some hanging chads.  Wow.  Truth teller from Wackbag.  Uh, the reason, uh, he didn't win is he's not an inbred, uh, like the butt kiss ass fuck  interns, especially Than, who was a big dick suck of a Wackbag jerk-off. 
[02:42:30]  Whoa.  Wow.  Jesus.  Sincerely, Travis.  Couldn't be any closer to the truth.  Wow.  You're a big dick suck of a Wackbag jerk-off?  You are really taking some heat.  Who's that from?  Uh, I don't know.  Some guy from Wackbag.  Yeah.  Ah.  I told him.  Did you, did you look at the videos today?  I, uh, I, I screwed up.  How's that for a new one in here?  I screwed up.  I actually claiming responsibility for something. 
[02:43:00]  I did not, uh, you know, I saw the list that Steve had, and now I disagree with how I  voted, so.  Wow.  Who'd you vote for?  Not, don't even say, cause we gotta do a re-vote.  It, it, this is too, this is too important to the people out there.  Well, what?  To the people doing this.  I'm serious.  Was there one more ahead of this?  This was second place?  Um, yeah.  We were about to announce the winner, but, and I was fine with the voting, I'll be honest  with you, until I saw that guy.  Pull out hair, fake pull out hair guy.  And I'll explain why, after we officially announced the winner, but that made me suspicious. 
[02:43:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  We gotta re-vote.  Can we do that?  Sure.  Well, I think now it's gonna be 11 to nothing.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir.  Don't be influenced by what I'm saying.  I just think, it was obvious to me that some of these guys did not actually see the videos,  that's all.  Not recently.  So we have to, all right, so from now on what we'll do is we'll just send links out 
[02:44:00]  to everybody and you can take a look at them that morning.  Last month we did it where people just sat down and watched the videos real fast.  No, my thing is, I-  It takes 10 minutes in the morning, that's it.  I'm assuming that everybody remembers what these things look at, because personally I've  seen them all, you know, a dozen times each, so I remember.  You could actually remember if there was any hint whatsoever what they were about on  that list.  It was something that says Channel 7 ABC News and has the reporter's name, gives you  no indication of which one that was.  If it's guy jumping up and down, pulling hair out, now you remember what that was. 
[02:44:30]  Well, when I walked around to everybody, I did give them a description of what it was.  Yeah, but for now on, why wouldn't they watch the videos?  It's not like it's a half hour video and very time consuming.  It's very quick.  Because you may forget.  Yeah, that's a problem.  I mean, I remembered that guy, but his audio is crystal clear that I didn't remember that.  Yeah.  Okay, recap.  Yeah, let's do it immediately.  Immediately.  Immediately.  Can we vote, Tim?  Should we vote? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, we should vote.  And I have a question, too, off the subject, just to remind you for later.  Is there audio of a particular puppet bad-mouthing this radio show?  Oh, bad-mouthing me, I guess.  What's the...  It's coming.  Who is it?  Insult comic?  Triumph.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got to be pretty proud of that.  That gag was funny for a few minutes on Conan.  Jesus.  Have we heard you like it?  To make a life and career out of it? 
[02:45:30]  Holy shit.  Matt in Massachusetts, what's up?  Oh, you guys got to start firing people around here.  They're fucking killing you.  Got to start firing people.  Have we fired anyone yet?  No.  I know we've just had it, but we've, like...  Honestly, in the end...  Bumped heads with a few interns, but...  Honestly, in the end, that's our problem.  Yeah.  We just can't pull the trigger.  I know people like, you know, Ron and Fez, they lop heads off like there's no tomorrow. 
[02:46:00]  You know?  Yeah.  They rule their show with an iron fist.  That's right.  We're a limp one.  You've got to get...  You've got to get you all down there and start rolling heads.  All right.  Yeah, we just need the basics done for this program.  That's all we ask for.  I think once one person's fired, I think the rest will fall into place.  I think they're so secure that we won't fire anybody that they just skip around all day  with their shoelaces untied.  Lacksadaisical is the word. 
[02:46:30]  Lacksadaisical.  Well, we get one sacrificial lamb and then the rest of the flock right in line.  After my top secret lunch, things will be much different.  When are you having lunch, Hope?  I'm hungry.  I told Elo I had to think about it, but now after the last couple days, I'm free today.  Elo.  I'm free today.  If you want to join me, come on by.  All right.  Brother Joe wants to say hi real fast before we take a break. 
[02:47:00]  Brother Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  There he is.  Hey, Brother Joe.  How are things?  Well, drummers hung over, and Tom's voice is pretty much shot.  It was rough, man.  No sound check.  Basically, we got there a little late, and then it was the whole union thing.  You know, people wouldn't let us take our own stuff downstairs, and we had to wait,  and by the time we got in, it was too late for a sound check.  Very difficult thing to pull it off live, coming off on the air, you know? 
[02:47:30]  Well, no, the problem wasn't so much any of that.  It was just the sound over the air was like, ee, ooh.  But live, it was great.  People loved it.  Yeah, I had no problem with it, you know, in the room once we got there.  What happened?  Problem with your drummer?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, sadly.  What's going on with him?  Oh, man, he's an al...  He's playing his day.  He's an al...  What?  Nice way to add it.  He's an alco...  Well, whatever.  No, he's an alcoholic.  The guy drinks like a... 
[02:48:00]  You know, he's a fucking drummer, man.  What do you want?  You know?  A lot of drummers get that way, you know?  Apparently, he was going around to everybody, including me, and saying, you know, how do  you handle Joe when he snaps?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Like, he's going around to everybody.  Yeah, I know.  Well, he's been put on triple secret probation.  Corrected.  The guy is so fucking talented.  You don't understand.  He's the old drummer from Nine Days.  And, I mean, not such a great credit, but, I mean, he did, you know, he did take part 
[02:48:30]  in a band that did something, you know, pretty huge as compared to most original bands that  come off Long Island.  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened with this guy is he was booted from Nine Days.  I mean, they told him, that's that.  You know, we're not going to have you anymore.  But due to the, you know, the bullshit that I had to go through with the guy, and the same  thing.  Too much drink, and, you know, not enough common sense.  I gave him pretty much what amounts to his last chance to make a living playing music. 
[02:49:00]  He is so talented.  You don't understand.  This kid produces like you can't believe.  He straightened out our live system, so it's tweaked.  It sounds amazing when we play through our own system.  He's not only a drummer, but a guitar player and a bass player as well.  It's got to keep him off the sauce.  That's it.  I basically, I told him, you know, this is the last time.  Next time he drinks, next time I see him drink a beer at a show, he's going to be fired 
[02:49:30]  immediately.  I will cancel that show.  You know how impossible that is?  You're working in bar atmospheres.  Oh, no, it's not.  No, it's not.  Because for the first month, he was an angel.  The kid didn't do, he drank water and Coca-Cola.  Yeah.  A month.  He could do it for a month.  He could do it for a year.  If he could do it for a year, he could do it for the rest.  Jimmy, being an addict, would you hang out in places where alcohol was flowing?  If it's a part of your job, you have to.  Shut up, Joe.  I'm talking to Jimmy. 
[02:50:00]  Well, you know, they play live.  It's a reality.  You have to be around alcohol sometimes.  You just can't, you know.  But what would you do?  Were you doing stand-up back when you quit?  Uh-oh.  Bless you, Jimmy.  Thank you, sweet boy.  I was sober three years before I did stand-up.  But the reality is, you have to.  It's said by certain people who may be sober that you can't run from alcohol.  You can't shy from it when it's a professional life.  You have to be around it.  The first few, like, months, let's say, into it, it seems a little, like, you're putting 
[02:50:30]  yourself through some real shit to be sitting there while everyone's drinking.  Well, there's things you can do while everybody's drinking.  As long as, it's all motives.  If you're there to work, if he's there to play drums and do the gig, he's fine.  Yeah.  But if you're there, like, if you're going to the dressing room while they're smoking pot  because you think you can handle it, then you've got a problem.  I think that's all your motives.  But if he wants to quit, he'll quit.  That sounds rough.  Yeah, well, all right.  What I like about Joe, he has no problem dropping the hammer.  Joe rules with an iron fist.  It certainly does.  I'm probably firing somebody.  I'm raising my hand. 
[02:51:00]  Can I speak now, Anthony?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Joe, I'm with Anthony on that one.  Joe, Joe, I asked Jimmy a question.  I thought it was directed toward me.  That's the only reason I jumped on it.  Look at this.  My brother has been in studio all morning.  He said a few things here and there.  He knows when to shut up.  Daryl knows when to shut up.  What I'm saying is, if you remember years ago, I'm going to say me.  I did a lot, a lot of the bean, if you know what I'm talking about. 
[02:51:30]  Coffee?  I did a lot of blow as a kid.  Right?  Sure.  Sure you did.  And it was around me all the time, constantly.  When I saw it was becoming detrimental to my life in general, I took it and I put it away.  I put it down.  Yeah, Coke's different, though.  Never to touch it again.  Well, then let's go.  It's not like you're at the bar and people are snorting lines.  You know, you really got to seek out.  If you're doing blow and then you stop doing blow and you don't want to be tempted, 
[02:52:00]  you don't, like, burst in on a toilet stall if you hear someone sniffling in there.  Because then you'll go, oh, shit, he's doing coke.  Then let's say cigarettes.  The last one I had was two fucking years ago.  I'm in bars all the time.  There you go.  That's very difficult.  That's a good example.  It all depends on the strength of the individual's mind.  And, you know, this kid's got some problems that he'll either deal with or he won't.  You know, he'll either have a living doing this or he won't.  Or we'll get in Joe's fuck-o-laird book. 
[02:52:30]  Well, you know, Joe has his own fuck-o list.  There's a ton of reasons to not work with people.  How old is the drummer, Joe?  Uh, 34.  Okay.  Someone says this sounds like a to you behind the music.  I love it.  You shoot the hostage.  Joe?  You shoot the drummer.  Joe, you don't want us rebroadcasting your set, huh?  No, definitely not, man.  It's fucked.  That's such a shame, man.  It sounded horrible.  This is going to end up in court now for years. 
[02:53:00]  It's because we're going to try to play it and Joe will file injunctions.  Yeah.  You think?  No, you know what, man?  There were parts that sounded fine.  Even on the air, I've heard the audio.  So some parts sounded fine.  A lot of it had to do with the mix.  I mean, the mix was...  The mix of what he was drinking.  Yeah, right?  No, the mix going out was...  There was no bass.  You know, even for, like, Livewire, there was no lead guitar going out over the air.  Some people are saying your problem is you're trying to out-drink you, too, which could be an issue. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, Jesus.  In all fairness, everyone at the Hard Rock thought you guys were amazing.  It's too bad it didn't translate to radio.  How could you guys do a sound check?  I don't get it.  We ended up having all of our stuff stacked outside the Hard Rock, and we were told that we would have stagehands, union guys from Times Square, take the shit in.  And we were waiting out there for a half hour.  One guy came out and said, oh, wait here.  We'll have stagehands out for you in a minute.  They never showed up.  By the time we asked, you know, we got everything in ourselves. 
[02:54:00]  They said, okay, yeah, bring stuff in.  By the time we got everything on stage set up and ready to go, it was almost doors.  Wow.  All right.  Miscommunication.  Okay.  Hey, a lot of people call, and they want to be the new drummer.  I could imagine, yeah.  We have a lot of those, man.  Email?  You want to – how did they contact you?  You know what, man?  They can figure out that.  Tell them to just send it to the site in case this thing does not work out with this kid. 
[02:54:30]  I have a ton of drummers, though.  I mean, it's not a difficult thing to do.  All right, Joe.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  And I had a pisser, you know, aside from the bullshit.  I had a really good fun.  That was a lot of fun, definitely.  You guys were great.  Thanks, bro.  All right, Joe.  See you guys.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  The voting is official now.  Everyone's seen the videos.  Oh, really?  Has it changed?  Uh, no.  No?  So I look like an idiot.  Are you kidding?  But at least I could move forward and feel good about the – 
[02:55:00]  Didn't change.  Didn't change.  That was everybody going, you know what?  Fuck the boss.  Fuck you.  If we unite, he can't fire us all.  I have a feeling.  But at least I know they've now watched the videos before they –  That's really funny.  They came up with their final vote.  So.  Oh, I'm looking out for the guys that work hard for us.  Pull your hair out, guy.  Go fuck yourself.  That's right.  There you go.  So we'll announce the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest for October next. 
[02:55:30]  Wee!  I just got wowed!  And some big old hooties on her.  And we see everybody!  It's the Opie and Anthony Wow Line.  If you're on the road and you get wowed, we want to know about it.  Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  Tell us where, tell us when, and tell us what those delicious boobies look like.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we just might use it on the air.  Ooh!  Ooh!  Head like a hole, black as a stone, I'd rather die, that gives you control. 
[02:56:00]  Head like a hole, black as a stone, I'd rather die, that gives you control.  Bow down before the one you stir, you're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before the one you stir, you're going to get what you deserve. 
[02:56:30]  Beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  All of the radio rips me off.  All of the radio rips me off.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  Beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Ah, thank you, Howard.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Hopefully you got your WOW stickers and they're proudly displayed on the back of your ride. 
[02:57:00]  Got to be in it to win it.  Got to be in it to see boobs.  Right, there you go.  All right, the Assault in the Media Contest.  Let's get this on the way.  Yeah, let's get the God damn it.  All right, so, all right, I'll play second place again.  That's where we're at.  Second place.  The real second place.  The real second place.  Right.  Everybody has voted.  They've seen the videos.  This is now very, very fair and very accurate.  Okay. 
[02:57:30]  Okay.  I do disagree, though.  Yeah.  Second place.  Mother Nature's trifecta of high tide, steady winds, blowing rains, et cetera, forced this,  the lake, to spill over on both sides.  And the result was evacuation.  Ah, the runner-up, pull the hair out guy.  Looking like a complete lunatic, jumping up and down and clear as day, getting all the  info out there. 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Are we ready for number one?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, listen to that professional-sounding timpani.  The winner for the Assault on the Media Contest for October is...  That'll keep going forever.  Is...  Is this fine piece of work. 
[02:58:30]  How do you like my get-up?  Looks pretty good.  Maronite.  My friends are around here.  They're everywhere here.  Salem is the place to be.  You can get...  You can't...  Although I think the other guy was definitely great, you can't knock that one either.  That was a really clear, bullhorn-used, dead-on assault on the media.  So that was a great one, too.  Well, we didn't vote.  Would you have voted for Sonny Farrelly?  Very tough, because the other guy really impressed me.  I don't know who I would have voted for.  They're both really good. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  He's in the picture.  I just like the visual of the other guy jumping up and down, pulling his hair out.  And he used the bullhorn like we suggested.  Well, that's...  Well, there's two things.  Sonny had the bullhorn, which was great.  But the other guy was screaming, yelling, pulling his hair out, jumping up and down.  But it's official.  Sonny Farrelly, who did his assault on the media on Monday, as we were at the Hard Rock, partying  our balls off, pulled it out in the end.  He's on the phone.  Sonny Farrelly. 
[02:59:30]  I'm Sonny Farrelly, and I'm on the television.  Sonny Farrelly, and I got two dinners now with E-Rock.  Why?  You won last month?  Yes.  But nobody gave me recognition for it.  Oh, you split the prize last month. 
[03:00:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Oh, we got a dynasty.  Wow.  No rules against that?  A dynasty.  Well, see, Boston Strangler took all the credit for that last one, but it really was my attack  on the media.  It was like, you got the assist on that one.  Yes.  Yeah.  You guys are like the Celtics of the 60s.  Absolutely.  Or the 80s.  Now, will you be dining with or without E-Rock? 
[03:00:30]  I think I'm going to be dining with him.  I would like to really dine with him.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock will be included in dinner.  Wow.  I'm a people person.  I really like to, you know, meet new people and shit like that.  I'd love somebody to dine with Eric and then just have a list of things that they want  to criticize him for the whole time he's eating.  And why was that shit not in order when Opie needed it while he's trying to put appetizers?  That'd be great.  He's trying to dip his shrimp in the cocktail sauce.  Yeah.  And you pull the sauce away. 
[03:01:00]  But first, why was that stuff not there?  Opie looked for it.  And Eric is so freaked out he can't find enough mayo to take care of the problem.  He just wants to stuff his face with mayo.  That is comfort food.  He's trying to comfort food.  Oh, yeah.  Whenever you're remembering that neighbor, whatever neighbor did what he did to you, it's  a mouthful of mayo.  I guess Boston Strangler doesn't have to buy my other half of the Mi-Fi.  I got to tell you, man, there's some hotbeds out there.  Boston doing a lot of assaults on the media. 
[03:01:30]  Buffalo doing a lot of assaults on the media.  And New York City, of course, the home of the Opie and Anthony program doing a lot of  assaults on the media.  Very proud.  But the cup goes to Boston until next month.  The cup.  Actually, it stays in Boston, I should say.  Yeah, dynasty, all right.  Sonny Ferrelli, congratulations.  You're the winner of the Assault on the Media contest for October.  Thank you, sir, and happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, thank you, sweetie.  Congratulations.  Will you be retiring as far as these assaults on the media goes? 
[03:02:00]  Fuck no.  No?  You got anything new planned?  Oh, believe me, I've got it all.  I got it all.  These guys are getting very creative, I've got to tell you.  They're trying to outdo each other.  They bragged each other on the message boards.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Sonny.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  You're winning videos up on OpieandAnthony.com, but here's the audio for the radio audience.  How do you like my getup?  Looks pretty good.  Very nice.  I've got my friends around here.  Everywhere here.  Salem is the place to be.  Opie and Anthony are on XM satellite radio. 
[03:02:30]  It really is good, obviously.  It's a great one, yeah.  You know, the reporter just stopped.  He didn't know what to do.  Very proud of the work you people are doing out there.  The bullhorn just blasted the reporter out.  He shut right up.  Yes.  All right.  Well, contest is on for November, Anthony.  New one.  We have the MiFi and the free subscription for a year for the MiFi and other prizes to be announced in the very near future, okay?  We should play Rob Bartlett one more time here.  Oh, yeah.  Is he in the contest? 
[03:03:00]  Is he the leader, you think?  I don't know.  Is that legal?  Why not?  He doesn't work for us.  It's so easy for him.  Huh?  He's got the camera on him all the time.  Yeah, but this will up the ante, too.  It really will.  Well, yeah, all right.  It doesn't work for us.  Sure.  He's in the lead.  He's in the lead for the Assault on the Media contest for November.  Yes.  In case you missed it, earlier today on I Miss Is Fine program on MSNBC, Rob Bartlett wearing the Opie and Anthony t-shirt that my brother designed and saying this. 
[03:03:30]  Let's please welcome to the program Brian Wilson.  Good morning, Brian.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  And hi, all you whack fags in cyberspace.  Congratulations on your first anniversary on XM.  O-N-A, party rock.  Now, I know that the first anniversary symbol is supposed to be paper.  And I was going to give you each a roll, but I used it all on Halloween, TPing Howard Stern's house. 
[03:04:00]  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  I invented that.  Tell him, Fred.  And if that wasn't enough, he added this.  So, be safe this flu season.  Get a shot.  Stay away from Popeyes.  And don't handle your bird if it's infected.  You really shouldn't handle your bird anyway, Opie, because, you know, it can make you go blind.  Or at least grow hair on your palms. 
[03:04:30]  Right, Anthony?  Right, Brian.  Right.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  What the hell is wrong with him?  27.  What the hell is wrong with him?  Who's that guy next to him?  Just another guy that does his voices.  At the end, or I'm just...  The next to him, the old guy with the mustache.  Oh, the news guy?  Oh, he's the news guy, okay.  I forget his name always.  What's his name again? 
[03:05:00]  He's not bad.  What's his name?  That's the other guy.  I mean, there's McCord.  Bernard.  No, no, no, not Bernard.  No, Bernard is hilarious.  He's not allowed in the new studio.  That's really creepy.  He's like an alien just on a monitor.  Why doesn't he go in there?  They don't want him?  I don't know, because he's really, really funny.  Yeah.  Extremely funny.  I wish they still did Cardinal O'Connor.  He used to always tell Imus to get AIDS.  It was really funny.  Why don't you get AIDS, Imus, in the morning?  They used to always make me laugh.  This is our new thing.  We'll just talk about other radio shows and what they're doing.  Yeah, why not? 
[03:05:30]  Is the system running?  Yeah, it starts...  I know, but we can do a picture quick.  All right, here's the deal.  So, Rob Bartlett from Imus' program is the current leader for the Assault on the Media Contest for November.  Eric, make sure you send him an email and tell him that he's in the lead.  And we look forward to other pests getting involved with this contest.  Jimmy, with his goddamn camera out already...  What are you doing, Jimmy?  He is already going to pester Hanson.  Yeah, because I've got to do some production work. 
[03:06:00]  Are they here?  Yeah.  So, he wants to get this done, like, as quickly as possible.  He's ready to run out of the studio to get a picture with Hanson.  There they are.  What are you doing with your belt buckle?  I'm just tightening it so I can put my thing on.  He's got, like, a holster for his camera, Opie.  He pulls it out like a six-shooter.  Pew, pew!  You've been captured.  What are you doing?  I just want to get a shot.  I've got to run a...  Do you do all three at once with you? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, of course.  Or do you take one with each individual Hanson?  I want to know your strategy.  No, I've just got to do a promo.  I've got to go cut a promo.  Yeah, Jimmy's got to leave the studio.  So, Eric is walking outside the studio with Jimmy,  and we want to listen in as he kisses Hanson's ass to get a picture.  Is his mic gone?  Where are they?  There's one of them right over there.  Go get them, Jimmy.  You can at least know what they look like, Jimmy.  What are you doing?  No, no, I'm just...  You know what it is? 
[03:07:00]  I want to stay for the interview,  but I've got to get a picture and then go do some...  Yeah, we're going to cut some liners.  Right, right.  I'm waiting for...  We understand, Steve.  Just go get your picture.  I'm waiting for Eric to get in the band of yours.  Why can't we hear Eric?  Are you talking into the space?  Oh, they're making coffee with the Starbucks machine.  Is Hanson having some coffee?  Yeah.  Look at that.  There's the...  You know, the middle Hanson lad is taller than the older Hanson lad now. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, right over here.  A little Hanson trivia for you there.  This way, so we don't give a plan.  Listen, Jimmy's setting up his stupid picture.  Jim just wants to get a photo with you guys.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, boy.  Fucking Jimmy.  Hi, Jim.  Oh, hi.  Hi, guys.  So you want to snap a photo?  Yeah, because I've got to do some...  I've got to cut some production here.  Can you take this picture, fella?  Thanks.  I'm sorry to body before you go on the air.  You're just shy.  We're going to break our... 
[03:08:00]  Break our...  Mark, what are you doing?  They're going to break my mic.  They're going to break what?  I don't know.  They have a rule about this?  Nice.  Cool.  Is that it?  Okay.  See you soon.  See you guys.  See you soon.  Oh, no.  How'd it go, Eric?  We're fine.  Got his photo, and he's going to the bathroom.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get Hanson in here next, okay?  Of course.  All right.  Boobs always bring this show to a halt.  Oh, screeching halt. 
[03:08:30]  I am real.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is beautiful.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  That's cool.  How about the woman that took the shirt off?  Ah, yeah.  Sexy.  Oh, sex, sexy, girls.  You have sorry.  Wow.  Or I'll show boobs.  Boobs.  I see boobs. 
[03:09:00]  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  Hey.  It was amazing.  That's nice.  Bothy and Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  It's world renown.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  What is that?  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Can't see your appointment.  Oh, yeah.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Huh?  Tell us your findings. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  And that will make me laugh really hard.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Whip them out Wednesday. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  And we're going to talk to Hanson here.  Yes, we are.  They got a new CD out called The Best of Hanson Live and Electric.  It's in stores now.  Hanson is Isaac, Taylor, and Zach.  Let's get them in here.  Open the door.  And talk to them.  Hey, guys.  We're all ready.  Right on the air.  They're actually early, which is cool.  Yeah.  When's the last time we had a musical guest that came early?  I don't know.  I don't think that's ever happened. 
[03:10:30]  Why?  You think people are like hanging out drinking until all hours?  I don't know.  It's just cool.  They're usually...  Hi, guys.  We were saying you're the first music guest to ever be early.  We're very happy.  Ah, yes.  Usually they don't show.  It's the first time we've ever been early.  Usually they don't show up or come in late.  Don't get any ideas.  Don't start calling other DJs and be like, hey, you should have Hanson there early.  It's great.  And be like, no.  No.  Do you guys do like a big radio run right now?  Well, I mean, our whole life is one run from one thing to another, I guess, in one way. 
[03:11:00]  But you just keep touring for years and years and years?  Is that it?  Well, I'm 22 years old.  And we've been a band since I was nine.  We've been writing and singing and playing shows and stuff.  Yeah, I saw some of the home movies.  Pretty funny stuff.  Like whenever they did a story on you on VH1 or something.  Like back in 97 when you guys, I guess...  First kind of broke out.  Yeah, they'd show it on VH1 and, you know, show your kids like, Jesus Christ.  What were you, like two behind a drum kid? 
[03:11:30]  Six.  It's at some carnival.  There's a ferric wheel behind you.  Like old eight millimeter movies or something.  Yeah, exactly.  Back from the 1940s.  I was trying to have the person at VH1 assassinated that actually got a hold of that.  Yeah, I got a hold of all that stuff, huh?  Were you really six when you started drumming?  I was nine when I started drumming.  I was six when we played our first professional gig.  What are your memories of being six and behind a drum kid?  You know, I don't have a lot of memories that aren't before music.  I mean, it's kind of strange.  But you remember drumming at six years old?  You have, like, vivid memories of this? 
[03:12:00]  Well, like I said, I didn't start drumming until I was nine.  Oh, okay, okay.  But I do remember, I mean, playing gigs.  You did a gig before you started drumming, though?  You said six was your first gig?  We were, I was six when we played our first paying professional gig.  Was it like singing just?  It was just a cappella.  Yeah, it was just a cappella.  I think that was some of the video I saw it, too.  The barbershop kind of thing.  Yeah, barbershop quartet.  That's right.  Slash the quartet, you know, not the quartet part.  Yeah, not the quartet.  Barbershop trio. 
[03:12:30]  Barbershop trio, yeah.  Whose idea was that?  It couldn't have been yours.  Hey, I want to be on the barbershop.  I want to do something they did in like the 1800s.  No, actually, well, it wasn't barbershop, but it was basically us kind of harmonizing  and memorizing 50s and 60s tunes that we had heard on, you know, oldies radio and gotten  a hold of, because of all things, we went, my dad was an accountant, and he was shipped  off for the company that he worked for, it was an oil drilling company, he was shipped 
[03:13:00]  off to Ecuador, and so we went, we followed him, and just so happened that my mom actually  purchased a tape from 1958, which was like 20 of the biggest hits of 1958.  And so I listened to that tape about 10 zillion times.  That was like all that was available?  It was between that and, you know, all Spanish all the time.  They're actually music, yes.  They're actually music.  They're actually music.  They're actually music.  You could have been like a Spanish band.  Yeah, exactly.  We could have come out as the Los Lonely Boys. 
[03:13:30]  We're going way, way, way too far back now.  All that to say, what was it that we were saying?  Oh, yes, we're punctual.  Yeah.  We happened to be punctual somehow.  I don't know how that happened.  Yeah, but that's the interesting stuff.  I mean, word began and stuff.  Yeah, well, I mean, again, we, you know, rock and roll, I mean, that's where we first,  you know, got off, you know, jumped off the wagon, so.  Yeah, and then what, you just decided to pick up drums?  You know, I think it was just a natural evolution that, you know, Isaac wanted to play guitar, 
[03:14:00]  and I couldn't play keyboards as well as Tate did, so, you know, drumming, God, that takes  about one brain cell, and, you know, it's something.  Go for it.  Hey, I am one.  It's self-deprecation, yes.  Yeah, well, I will say, though, the thing is, your drummer is far more crucial.  Everybody always makes the drummer jokes, but the truth is, you know, thanks to Zach, he's  holding down the fort, and we actually know.  The guy that hangs out with the band.  He makes a sound good.  He makes a joke.  He's the guy that hangs out with the band.  How do you know when the drum riser's level, when drool's coming out of both sides of 
[03:14:30]  the drummer's mouth?  There's some great ones.  They're all pretty true, in most cases.  How many bass players does it take to screw in a light bulb?  None.  The keyboard player can do it with his left hand.  Hey, wait, do you guys, what size venues were you guys doing?  I know you guys had a tremendous...  We were playing, you know, it goes everywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500, depending on where  you are.  I mean, we're doing two shows at the House of Blues in Chicago. 
[03:15:00]  We're doing a show tonight at Nokia Live, I guess.  Oh, right.  Nokia Theater, whatever that is.  Where's that?  It's here, Matt?  Oh, okay.  It's actually...  Nokia Theater's amazing.  Yeah, it's actually...  It's an old venue, but it's a new concert venue.  They did the whole thing.  It's been a...  It's been a movie theater, I think, for a long time.  Yeah, it's amazing what they've done with the Nokia Theater.  How do people get tickets, or are you guys sold?  Um, there's still...  I think there's still some tickets left, but it's really close to being sold out, so they can...  I think Ticketmaster is the, um...  The evil Ticketmaster.  Yeah, the evil Ticketmaster.  The evil Ticketmaster, Matt. 
[03:15:30]  Or you can go to...  It's doing Matt.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, everybody, you know, there's no way around it, unfortunately, but...  Want to sell tickets?  Yeah, or Hanson.net.  You can go to the website, www.hanson.net.  It's Hanson.com, Ticketmaster.  Uh-oh, what happened?  Hanson.com is like a legal consulting firm or banking...  You guys are diverse.  Yeah, no, it...  Who do you have to diversify?  I only wish.  No, no.  Doesn't that suck when someone else has your name like that?  It used to, uh...  I think it probably still says it on the front page, but...  When you go to that, Hanson.com, it says, 
[03:16:00]  This is not the band Hanson's website.  Do they put a link to your site?  Oh, that's pretty cool.  It says, This is not their website.  Go away, please.  I'd rather have guys that want legal aid going to .net.  Well, this isn't going to help me at all.  They look young to be lawyers.  Must be a Christian movie.  That's the bar of teaching.  It's weird.  There's music and...  And some kind of entertainment.  Hey, man, we could do that.  We could do something on Angel of Lising. 
[03:16:30]  Exactly.  We don't really have enough on our plate anyway.  While we're on tour, you know, we could have people, you know,  give them stock quotes and, you know, just...  Yeah, whatever the hell comes up, man.  You guys never stopped touring since 97, 98?  No, we've stopped touring.  Because we're not the biggest fans, obviously.  But, I mean, everyone knew, I hate to say it,  oom-bop and all that.  And you guys were huge.  And then, you know, you still have a fan base.  You guys never went away, right?  Well, I mean, the quick recap is, I mean,  there actually has been a couple big gaps between records.  But, like, for instance, the last record, 
[03:17:00]  Underneath, which is our last album,  it was four years between that and our second album.  And the reason that was was because of kind of  where we were with our record company.  And we...  Oh, yeah.  Well, we made a documentary about it.  We made a documentary about it.  Well, one of the things that we're doing, actually,  on this whole tour is we're going to universities  showing this documentary we made.  And in 99, there was a big record...  It was one of the biggest record company mergers happened.  And so we ended up on a rap label.  And so there was about four years between 2000 and... 
[03:17:30]  Well, 2001 and 2004,  where it was just the struggle of getting off that label,  you know, the label that we inherited,  the rap label.  Much, I mean, we're one of many bands.  It's a story that everybody's going to do.  Did you guys just watch Umba Money  just fly out of your pockets?  Was that one part of the problem?  No, that is definitely not the problem.  No?  No, not at all.  Okay.  I just...  Because that would be a horror story, man.  Yeah.  If all of a sudden you guys were on stage  for the 80 billionth time,  Umba Money,  and it was just a record executive 
[03:18:00]  lighting a cigar with hundreds.  Yeah.  You're on a per diem.  That would have been a terrible story.  Thank God that didn't happen.  Yeah, it didn't happen.  We were actually very lucky because...  Yeah, how did that work out?  Because usually you get screwed on the first day.  Well, you know, we wrote that song,  so we were getting the publishing for that.  Yeah, apparently.  Yeah, talk to like Skid Row about writing songs  and then getting the publishing rights to him.  Well, we own the publishing too.  We never sold that.  See?  Now, that's pretty cool.  Who was smart enough to...  We had a smart manager who was an attorney.  Hanson, right?  I went to his website. 
[03:18:30]  Nice guy.  Hanson.com, that's the other guy.  Exactly, yeah.  Well, it's convenient.  We only work with people named Hanson.  Exactly.  That way everyone, it's just clear.  You work with Hanson?  Yes.  That's me.  Was one of you guys dating Kelly Osbourne or Amy Osbourne?  No, we weren't.  It was rumored for a very, very long time.  Yeah.  It would have been interesting, though.  It was a rumored for a long time  that I was dating her  because we met a couple times  and she was particularly a Hanson fan 
[03:19:00]  and so I think, you know, things just travel.  But that was one of those rumors  that went around the world, you know?  Yeah.  It's the information age in a second.  You guys...  You're dating Ozzy Osbourne?  No, I don't think so.  Your fan base, obviously,  it was huge and full of very young girls  at the time.  No, you can't come to a show.  No, yeah.  What was that all about?  I mean, did you have chaperones?  Was there the temptation there?  You know what? 
[03:19:30]  Of course, I mean, every guy, you know,  there's nothing wrong with having a lot of screaming girls.  I mean, that's by no means is a bad thing in the audience.  But, I mean, honestly, we just, you know,  you just did never...  We were just there to make music.  I mean, the fact that we had fans at all.  I mean, every band is praying to God  to actually have somebody to buy their record, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  Especially these days.  You know, come to a show  and not stand with their arms crossed.  Yeah, I mean, like, you know,  to not have this audience.  So we've just been always really lucky.  You know, I mean, and it's certainly,  I mean, you know, you... 
[03:20:00]  Certainly, it's been...  It's been an exciting time at times.  I mean, there are certainly plenty of situations  that were...  We can attribute our female...  Companion.  Companion.  Well, for instance, I met my wife at a show.  Yeah, yeah.  He met his wife at a show.  It was a little more complicated than just,  hey, you, get over here.  Yeah, we want you guys like going to the roadie.  Dude, fifth row.  Uh, 12th row over.  Actually, that was me.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  That's, like, that's me.  It's sad to say.  Dude, you can't miss her.  Just me.  Do you tend to want to bang older chicks, though? 
[03:20:30]  Because a lot of...  I know a lot of...  No, I'm telling you,  because a lot of guys that have had, like,  really young female fans  say that they went for older  because it was like,  you know you can bang them whenever you want.  She's out of jail.  Well, I can understand...  I can understand that if they were frustrated  with the end of their fans being younger.  You know, it was kind of ironic, though,  because in a lot of cases  the fans were about our age  and still are.  Well, but you know what...  You know, Zach was 11.  I was 16.  Most of our fans were between the ages  of 11 and 16 years old.  You know, granted,  it was older than that a little bit, 
[03:21:00]  but it's still...  And that's still the case.  You know, most of the fans  that are coming to the show  are between 20 and 25 years old.  Okay.  That's great now.  Perfect.  Yeah, they grow up.  They're old enough.  They're old enough.  Exactly.  Is it tough to be married so young?  Not many people are getting married  at a young age these days.  Well, I mean...  And you've been married a few years now, right?  I've been married three and a half years.  Wow.  And how old are you?  22.  Wow.  And even worse.  Even worse.  We're better at have two kids.  Two kids.  Yeah.  At 22.  You know, it's just like... 
[03:21:30]  I guess it's like everything else.  I mean, we just did it on our own timeline.  We, you know,  didn't ever look at anybody else  and be like,  hey, what are you doing?  Timeline.  The same timeline as Logan's Run.  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  Yeah.  Apparently.  You know,  I love that you referenced that.  That's so random.  We'll reference more obscure movies than that.  Our whole life is sitting in front of TVs.  A bunch of morons.  The extermination of old people.  That's what that movie could have been called.  It's great that they give you a microphone, though,  because you can connect with all the other morons. 
[03:22:00]  Exactly.  That is sitting at home.  I know that movie.  Look.  I'm involved.  I, you know,  it's like...  There is a society that can accept me.  Exactly.  Euthanasia celebrated.  We're horrid shut-ins.  Do you guys feel like,  I mean,  I know you've been on the road for a long time,  and do you feel like,  a lot of people talk about,  like, the maturity,  like,  when one,  you start, like,  in one place,  and all of a sudden,  you look,  and it's like,  like,  now you're like,  okay,  it's been a long time,  so, like,  we start here. 
[03:22:30]  Sure.  Do you find yourself,  when you're playing,  like,  some of the older stuff,  going,  like,  well,  all right,  well,  that was,  like,  in one place.  Yeah.  Sure.  Well,  it certainly feels,  at times,  like,  it was at one place,  but,  for the most part,  it's,  it feels really,  really good.  I mean,  I think a lot of people,  I mean,  it's so hard to not get into the,  I mean,  all the conversation we're having,  like,  about how young we started,  you know,  people assume that,  like,  there's a bigger jump for us,  because of being so young,  you know,  thinking,  like,  oh,  that was,  like,  stuff that we,  kind of,  you know,  weren't into,  or, 
[03:23:00]  you know,  you've made this jump,  where you don't want to be playing that stuff,  you know,  like,  that was the young stuff,  but,  I guess we,  you know,  the influences we've had,  were so obscure,  like,  we were listening to stuff,  originally,  that were so outside of the ballpark of anybody out of our generation,  like,  old,  classic rock and roll and stuff,  that I think there was less of a,  like,  you know,  this was our teen music,  you know,  we were young,  but we were kind of our own little,  you know,  internal time clock,  because we all had these weird,  you know,  these alter influences.  I remember kicking a guy out of our house, 
[03:23:30]  because he didn't know who the Jackson 5 were.  Our neighbor walked over,  and I was like,  man,  what are you listening to?  Jackson 5.  I don't know who they are.  Leave.  That's what actually gets me to invite somebody in.  All right,  I've got to do some production,  I'll be back in a little bit.  All right,  okay.  All right,  Jimmy.  How did you deal with,  like,  things,  just basic voice change things?  Did that affect how the songs come out?  You know,  that didn't have a whole lot of effect.  I mean,  I was the only one who kind of experienced that after that first record, 
[03:24:00]  and it just kind of happened.  Taylor was kind of going through some man around.  I mean,  I was right at that time where you were,  you know,  voice changes and stuff like that when you first broke out.  But really working,  like,  doing all the singing,  really having to use your voice all the time,  kind of kept that from being a big issue.  Yeah.  Have you had to deal with that very much?  I mean,  obviously,  you've got a couple more years before that happens.  Believe me.  What are you guys hoping for as far as your careers as you move forward?  Well,  you know what I mean?  So far,  the fan base has been strong. 
[03:24:30]  It's going to be tough to beat Oombop.  Sure.  Well,  you don't try to,  I mean,  you would never try and beat Oombop.  I mean,  that's not at all what you're trying to do.  I mean,  where we are now,  we own our record company.  We release all our music independently,  and we are very pro what's happening with independent music.  I think that's kind of where we're,  our passion is.  And of course,  making music,  I mean,  specifically,  you're just evolving and,  you know,  working with people that you really like.  I mean,  for every,  for every percentage point and share that, 
[03:25:00]  you know,  the majors lose in the music industry,  the,  the indies are gaining.  And it's because there's,  it's because they are,  the indies are speaking to their audience more.  They're actually doing artist development.  They're actually caring about.  Are you looking for other people?  Do you like sign anybody else?  Yeah.  I mean,  you know,  there,  there's a lot of,  there's a lot of really great music out there.  And we are lucky enough that we get exposed to a lot of stuff on the road.  You get exposed to a lot.  For instance,  they're like,  hey,  listen to my record.  Yeah.  They have an Area 51 file. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Actually,  we do.  We do have the,  like,  iPod,  like,  worst,  worst demos ever on the playlist.  And it's just like,  it's one of those things you can listen to on the bus,  and you just kind of like,  you all cringe.  But we do laugh really hard.  Yeah.  Opie's got a great story about that.  We,  we get handed a lot of music and stuff.  And we were up in Boston doing radio up there.  We basically gave up.  I mean,  so many bands would hand in their demos and stuff to us.  Sure.  And they all socked.  So it got to a point where we wouldn't even, 
[03:26:00]  like,  listen to them anymore.  And I actually got the demo for Godsmack.  And he threw it out the window.  Threw it out the window into a river.  Wow.  Or I could have been,  and I could have,  yeah,  fuck these guys.  We could have been the ones that technically discovered Godsmack.  Because then what happened,  another DJ at the station we were working at,  at the time,  really helped their careers.  Because he,  he actually listened to the thing and went,  oh my God,  and started playing it on the radio.  Sure.  And the rest is history.  Oops.  But we had the demo in our hand,  but we were so jaded that I just threw it out the window into a river.  It's easy to get jaded though.  Yeah.  It's hard because there, 
[03:26:30]  I mean,  there's so many bands out there.  I mean,  the epidemic now is all these bands that look exactly right.  They're like,  you know,  the band that looks so hip and so perfect,  but they just don't have any guts.  It's like the Stones without any soul.  Wow.  They're just,  they're just playing the parts these days.  Yeah.  They're just playing the parts.  But they're glorified by a lot of these,  you know,  super indie credible stuff.  I understand.  You were talking about like your influences and stuff,  but is there anything new that you dig now that you're listening to?  Yeah,  there's tons of stuff.  I mean, 
[03:27:00]  some,  most of it's probably more random,  but,  you know,  like there's some independent bands,  like there's an Australian band I've been talking about.  It's called,  they're called Dallas Crane,  which is just a really great kind of blues influence rock band.  There's a couple.  Is there a person out of Boston called Blue?  He's a friend of ours.  B-L-E-U.  He's awesome.  You know,  other people like Ben Queller,  who's a,  and their friend,  who's just an awesome artist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of these guys are kind of along the kind of rock singer, 
[03:27:30]  songwriter,  you know,  definitely song based.  genre.  Yeah.  So,  you know,  more band based stuff,  but,  you know,  certainly there's a lot of great stuff.  I mean,  I,  I look,  I also feel like it's,  it bums me out sometimes because you feel like R and B and hip hop has also gotten into  a rut too,  where they're just,  you're cranking out a certain element,  a certain formula,  as opposed to it being more creative.  And it seems that,  it seems that all of the,  what do you mean?  The same sample from some random song in the seventies with like a guy going, 
[03:28:00]  uh,  uh,  isn't creative.  Yeah,  exactly.  He did.  He made a whole career out of it.  Uh oh.  Hey,  let's go to the phones.  They have exploded.  We got Hanson in studio.  The best of Hanson live and electric is in stores now.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve,  what's up?  Steve.  Hi,  hello.  How are you?  Hey,  Steve,  how's it going?  I'm a little bit nervous.  I just wanted to know,  um,  is there going to be like any type of a,  a ticket giveaway because I'm,  I'm riding around in my car and it's kind of broken down because I ran over a twig. 
[03:28:30]  So I wanted to know if anybody is like going to be giving away some tickets for the Hanson show because I'd really like to go.  Ticket giveaway.  To the show tonight?  Yes,  because I,  I,  I currently live in New Jersey and I was coming back from rehab and I wound up like running over something and my car is not working.  Uh,  if it was a twig,  it sounds like you've got more problems than,  than the car breaking now.  I wanted to know if you could possibly get some tickets.  Okay.  If you come to the show tonight,  we'll be on the stage.  What? 
[03:29:00]  You,  Rune,  bring me music you can suck a cock to.  Wow.  That sounds like,  Rune,  bring me a rapist with three dicks.  You are,  Steve.  Rune,  Hanson was Robert Reed's favorite man.  Robert Reed.  Oh my God.  Steve.  Oh my God.  Come on.  We're getting along with these guys. 
[03:29:30]  Stop.  Asshole.  Thank God for satellite radio.  The culture club sound like Black Sabbath.  All right.  There he goes.  Oh my God.  Sorry about that.  I was,  you know,  I was thinking to myself,  you know,  running over a twig.  That just doesn't really work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't sound believable.  No,  no.  You should actually call back in a few more minutes and come up with a different story.  She saved the rehab comment.  That gave it away right away.  Yeah.  Because we only,  we know only people, 
[03:30:00]  you know,  sitting right here would possibly be going to rehab.  Mick from Ohio.  Mick.  Hey boys,  Mick fans.  All right.  Thanks,  Mick.  Not you.  Question.  What do you guys think of that t-shirt that's out and about that says,  I fucked the chick from Hanson?  That shirt is everywhere.  You know what?  As the chick from Hanson,  I would,  you know,  it's,  it's,  it's,  that's sad.  Can that guy fuck you?  You know what? 
[03:30:30]  It's,  it's obviously something you gotta laugh at.  So there we go.  We're laughing.  Exactly.  So I actually think the funny one,  the one that we,  we all found thoroughly entertaining were the several random references in family guy.  Oh God.  I don't know if you guys are familiar with those.  Yeah.  Oh God,  the children of the corn and then the shotgun,  you know,  and,  and,  you know,  quagmire and quagmire.  You mean that's not a girl?  Oh,  the,  oh,  oh. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah,  that's great.  Family guy is hysterical.  Yeah,  I feel honored to be on Meg's wall.  Yes.  You guys did a good job on SNL too,  kind of goofing on yourselves with the elevator music.  You know,  we're not,  we're not afraid to make fun of ourselves.  I mean,  you gotta,  you gotta laugh at it.  But you know,  I mean,  honestly,  you know,  there,  any person,  any artist,  anybody that's ever been at a point where enough people know them,  to make a joke that's actually funny to someone means that you've reached enough people that,  that you're,  you know,  that's a pretty phenomenal thing. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Obviously,  like if someone takes,  you know,  goes far and actually makes something that's specifically like a,  a personal diss,  that's one thing that's too far.  But,  but if you can't laugh at yourself because it's relevant enough for somebody to know what the joke is.  Right.  It's like,  okay,  well,  you know,  that's pretty,  it's pretty significant.  We,  you know,  we can't,  you can't take that very seriously.  Yeah.  Yeah,  exactly.  Yeah.  Everybody's got some,  you know,  bad joke that you can tell on them no matter who you are.  All right,  let's go to the phones.  Hello,  who's this?  I lost them. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  That was,  that was a really,  a substantive call though.  Hey,  who's this?  The phone's.  This is John.  Hey John,  what's up?  You got a question for Hanson?  Yeah,  did you guys have problems when your voice change in developing your music?  Have you been listening to the show,  sir?  I asked that pertinent question.  He's taking,  he's taking your job,  dude.  I know.  I might as well just leave.  No,  never,  never really had that concern.  Of course not.  I know.  We,  you do have to lower some of the keys of songs.  I mean,  clearly. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to James.  Let's move on.  James.  James.  Gumm,  James.  Hello.  Hey,  James.  Hey,  are you guys putting out any new music?  Mrs. Lipman wants to know if you're putting out any new music.  Yes,  we have a new record out,  live and electric.  That's all I know.  See,  Ike's taking this opportunity to just continually speak as if,  as if there wasn't,  um,  someone.  Is this sound a cock?  That's when it pops out of my asshole.  That, 
[03:33:00]  oh,  that is just not a picture of my one.  You know what?  Don't include,  don't include us in your fantasies that you'd like to have.  This should be the butler for the Adamus family.  Shut up,  you ass.  Ramone,  these three are the poster boys for the Rainbow Coalition.  That doesn't even make sense.  Ramone,  Jeffrey Dahmer should eat these things.  It's great,  it's great that you guys, 
[03:33:30]  you know,  allow for people that,  you know,  should be actually put away to be on the radio.  Oh,  it's,  you know,  I figure it's good.  It's sound like radio,  you know,  entertaining,  you know,  are there actually any,  I mean,  are there really any particular rules that you guys have?  you guys want to curse?  There's nothing that can't be said.  You've never cursed on a radio before,  right?  I got kicked off of a BBC radio for cursing.  Really?  Yeah.  You can actually tell the full story.  I said fuck. 
[03:34:00]  And,  and then all of a sudden the interviewer went,  thank you very much,  Hanson.  Thank you very much for coming.  We were banned for,  I don't know,  it was a month or two from Scottish radio.  Well,  of course,  then they had us back on and then laughed about it,  but they,  we still couldn't talk about what the actual story was.  Exactly.  What was the story?  Well,  the story was that it,  it wasn't even that much.  It wasn't even that much.  We were hanging out with,  uh,  Steven Jenkins from third eye blind and we,  you know,  we're driving out.  There wasn't a parking spot and he's like,  park over there. 
[03:34:30]  We're like,  that's a fire hydrant.  And he's like,  we're fucking rock stars.  And then we walked into the club and,  and the lady goes,  Hey,  are you on the list?  And we went,  fucking rock stars.  And he kind of like pointed it around.  It was just,  it was just a funny story at the time that,  uh,  doesn't seem to be funny right now.  Steven Jenkins.  And it basically,  it was basically entailing that,  you know,  the guy who was doing the interview was,  you know,  going,  well,  Hey,  I mean,  you know,  Zach,  you're,  it was two years ago.  It was Zach,  Zach,  you're 18 now.  You can,  uh,  you know, 
[03:35:00]  drink,  drink here in the UK.  And Zach's like,  uh,  yeah.  And,  and he goes,  well,  you know,  I mean,  it's legal here.  And Zach's like,  and,  and he goes,  well,  you can't do that in the United States.  And he goes,  dude,  I'm fucking rock star.  Oh,  that's fine.  That really stops me.  That's all right.  Not to mention,  you drink.  Not to mention,  it's easier in,  you know,  it's,  it's called,  you put it on the writer.  Exactly.  Did you guys ever bang the same checks?  Like all three of you just rail them?  Uh,  no,  that would be really sick. 
[03:35:30]  It's one step shy of incest.  I don't mean at the same time.  I mean,  you know,  domino theory kind of thing.  He was married.  No.  We probably don't,  don't do that.  That would be like a Hanson fan's like ultimate dream of the hat trick.  Yeah.  You're knowing.  I don't know.  I,  you know,  for,  I don't really want to meet that thing.  No.  I don't think of it.  Cause it would just,  you just don't want to be third with that.  It would be,  it would be,  yeah.  Yeah.  That is kind of sick. 
[03:36:00]  Really?  All right.  I don't like,  like Tay,  Tay said one step shy of incest.  Yeah.  Well with that,  let's thank Hanson for stopping by.  It's Hanson.net.  Let's remember that.  Yes.  We're playing the Nokia theater tonight in New York city.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think it's still available.  Sort of.  And yes.  I don't know how many there are.  There's not very many left.  Yeah.  And the best of Hanson is in stores now live and electric,  right?  Yep.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you gentlemen.  Thank you for having us.  It was fun.  We greatly appreciate it.  Hey,  no problem.  Tell Steve hello when he comes back.  Yes. 
[03:36:30]  Guys,  please keep your pants.  Well,  hold on.  We got Ben from Boston actually.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben,  we've missed you.  Exactly.  Are you,  are you having an orgy with yourself yet?  Uh-huh.  What?  What?  No,  I wanted to go,  dude,  I wanted to go see the show,  dude.  I told you guys when you're a boss,  you're doing home covers. 
[03:37:00]  Ramone.  Hang on,  hang on,  hang on.  Ramone,  these three should have their own show on the AIDS network.  Ramone,  their next video should be a snuff film.  Ramone,  they sound like queer life with this great guy with a ukulele.  Ramone,  this band sucks. 
[03:37:30]  Ramone,  bring me Michael Jackson with a Viagra.  That doesn't make sense.  Yeah,  the Michael Jackson one made sense.  Yeah,  well,  you know,  I think we're far too old for Michael at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I should call him up,  though.  I,  you know,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  Michael Jackson also one of the guys you'd be scared to meet. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  To be alone with.  No.  You never called you guys up?  We,  we almost met him once.  Almost, yeah.  And then,  and it was like,  it was like,  because we met a guy who was,  who had worked,  or no,  no,  what it was,  was we went to a studio where Michael had been working and was really good friends with the guy who ran the studio.  And we went to go see some friends who were working at that studio.  And it was one of these,  hey,  you guys want to meet Michael Jackson?  We're kind of like,  yeah,  no,  no,  no,  yeah,  but we forgot our studio.  We're in a space suit.  And we forgot our friend on the phone that would really enjoy that. 
[03:38:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  We hung up.  All right,  guys,  thank you so much.  Hey,  thank you.  Glad to be here.  Best of Hanson Live and Electric is in stores now.  All right.  Thanks.

Which I had to do.  They were so on to you.  They pointed to where you sit and go,  yeah.  Did they?  I didn't see that.  Oh, they were totally on to who it was.  I had to turn around.  I couldn't look out.  Ramon.  I'll shoot my hand on the way.  Yeah, do they?  Yeah, thanks, asshole. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard some of that.  That was pretty good.  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah, I heard it.  How much time we got left in this show?  Four minutes, really?  Fool.  Hmm.  I think the important thing, though, is Caroline's.  Oh, well.  November 23rd through 26th.  Now that we've gotten to the meat of the air.  Very, very important for Jimmy. 
[03:41:00]  Isn't that like Thanksgiving weekend?  Yeah.  I will be there.  Thanksgiving, very big entertainment weekend.  Is it?  Yeah, that Wednesday.  Wednesday is huge.

[03:41:30]  Yeah, but they don't know how to spell duck.  D-U-K, baby.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  D-U-K.  That's my new alias.  Do you want a t-shirt or no?  No, not for that.  Go to MyRadioStore.com for my brother's t-shirts.  They're great.  All right.  Where's Ron and Fez?  I want to talk to them before we get off the air.  I want to apologize to them personally.  They need a formal apology.  Do we have time to get them in here real fast?  Ron and Fez are up next on this fine channel 202. 
[03:42:00]  They're entering the studio.  I hope they accept our apology.  They were broadcasting live at the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween night for us.  Uh-oh.  I see Harry running.  If he's responsible for getting them, I'll never get them.  Oh, here they come.  Here they come.  All right.  Ron and Fez entering the studio.  Here they are.  Ron and Fez.  They look pretty beat up.  We want to apologize to you guys.  We want to formally apologize. 
[03:42:30]  Personally.  To your faces.  For the debacle that you had to be involved in.  First of all, I apologize to Fez for not inviting him in during Hanson.  That's what got to him.  Oh, God.  As I got my fat face pressed up against the window.  Yeah, we saw you out there.  Hey, one time I accidentally was watching one of their videos and whacked off to the singer.  I thought they were an old chick band when they were younger.  Yeah.  Yeah, they sure are cute.  Yeah, adorable.  Although the one didn't age well. 
[03:43:00]  Which one?  The gangly one.  He's all buck teeth and elbows now.  Yeah.  Pretty sad.  Why would you get married so young and have two kids, 22?  Can you imagine?
