<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Rosie O'Donnell returning one of her adopted children, speculating on her motivations and veering into crude and offensive humor, including sexually explicit jokes and derogatory remarks. Callers shared their own adoption experiences, some recounting unexpected racial discrepancies with their adopted children.  The hosts also discussed O'Donnell's reported unusual post-adoption hygiene habits. A caller then recounted a bizarre story involving a woman attempting childbirth with a chicken.  Comedian Jeffrey Ross was a guest in the studio during this segment.

A lengthy phone interview with Bob May, the actor who played the Robot in *Lost in Space*, followed.  Initial confusion about May's role (the hosts mistakenly believed he was the voice actor) led to a humorous but awkward conversation, punctuated by more crude and offensive humor from the hosts and callers.

The show then shifted to a recap of a past stunt involving being hit with golf balls at a driving range for charity. They recounted their experience, the golfers' reactions, and their unsuccessful attempt to donate the proceeds, concluding with an offensive anecdote about their general manager, Bruce Mittman ("the midget"), presenting a large donation check.  This transitioned into a discussion of a disastrous prank involving 500 pies intended for the hosts by "Dada Dave."  The fallout included the hiring of a PR firm (featuring Mittman), a failed photo op with the mayor, and a disastrous attempt to use the pies as a charity donation at a children's cancer hospital.  The hosts felt deeply uncomfortable using the children for a PR stunt and left, leading to their firing, which they viewed positively.

The show then contrasted their successful "WOW" bumper sticker campaign with the failures of other radio stations, mocking a Z100 campaign, a Light FM commercial with Valerie Smaldone and Terry Garr, and a TV commercial featuring Scott and Todd in dresses.  A humorous visual impression of Christopher Reeve DJing was performed. A phone call with comedian Jeff Norris ("Gorilla Boy") followed, recounting a dubious story involving a prop gun, a car accident, and a police encounter, leading to a humorous back-and-forth with the hosts and callers.  This was followed by a call with Barley Goss of the band Fuel, playing a clip of their song "Baby Raper" and discussing their unconventional lifestyle. Paul Mercurio and Mike Di Nicola were in studio during parts of this segment.


Another call from Barley, a country music artist from "Deer Lick Holler," dominated the next segment with humorous, often crude, banter about his life, including suggestive comments about the women and speculation about bestiality.  His manager, "Max Percentage," was mentioned, and comparisons were made between Presidents Clinton and Bush.  The hosts discussed technology's presence (or lack thereof) in Deer Lick Holler. This was followed by a bizarre in-studio game where a blindfolded woman, Wendy, attempted to identify her brother by touch among multiple men, including the hosts and guests.  The prize was a meet-and-greet with Jim Brewer.  Numerous callers expressed outrage, and the segment continued despite the negative feedback.  Musical interludes from Hayseed Dixie were featured. The show then included a discussion of after-school specials, with inappropriate and sexually suggestive jokes.  A call from "Drudge Jr.," offering unfunny Christopher Walken-related information and discussing a potential mayoral run, concluded this segment, followed by more sexually suggestive jokes about Old Dirty Bastard.

The final segment started with a rambling, nonsensical conversation about sperm, utilizing crude metaphors and sexually suggestive jokes.  A guest, Petey, joined the studio, engaging in a bizarre exchange with the hosts about ethnicity and speech patterns, filled with further sexually suggestive and offensive remarks. The conversation shifted to a story about a chiropractor accused of sexual misconduct, with the hosts using vulgar language and playing an audio clip from the chiropractor's arrest, further highlighting his offensive statements. The show ended with more sexually explicit jokes and banter from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Hooyah!  Sucks man from wall to wall.  1027 WNEW.  Opie, have you read the paper today and seen what Rosie O'Donnell's up to?  I sure have.  She's giving one of her kids back.  Defective.  The kid's defective.  She adopted a defective kid, and she's giving it back. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, because it's crazy.  Read it word for word, because that's what I got out of it,  and she's trying to save face by saying we're hoping that, you know,  we could bring her back into the house.  That the authorities took the kid away.  But an anguished Rosie O'Donnell has given up one of her four adopted children.  The talk queen has confirmed that authorities took her emotionally impaired foster child, Mia,  for treatment at a mental health center last month.  It's a tragedy for me and my whole family, Rosie says, in the new National Enquirer. 
[00:01:00]  I think I can save everyone.  It's my weakness and my strength.  Your strength is eating.  Yeah, how many bites did the kid have out of her legs?  But O'Donnell says that in the nine months since Mia came to live with her,  the three-year-old showed more and more symptoms of past abuse,  like waking up screaming at night and scratching her arms.  She's not the demon seed, says O'Donnell. 
[00:01:30]  But there were real danger concerns with my baby, Blakey.  Blakey?  I'm just praying the doctors decide she can come back to the family.  No, she's not.  In my opinion, she gave the kid back.  That's what I'm kind of squeaking out of this here, too.  She adopted the kid, probably a cute, cuddly little kid.  And then all of a sudden she starts noticing things like,  wait, there's something wrong with this kid.  This kid's broken.  The kid's broken.  I'm sending it back. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, you gave me a busted one.  The kid's busted.  I want a new kid.  New, real, whole kid, not half kid.  And then to save face with the press and stuff.  Because this stuff happens all the time.  Yeah.  Parents adopt kids and then all of a sudden, like, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, I didn't want a black kid.  All of a sudden they discover the kid might be black or something.  Discovering.  What?  I've read the stories, man.  They discover the kid's black. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  There's all the fault.  There's Anthony.  How did that happen?  You're thinking when you say black, it's black.  There are times, you know, the kid's a little bit black.  And you don't really know at first.  Really?  Yes.  All right.  Someone will back me up.  People do this stuff all the time.  They're assuming they're getting, you know, one type of kid and they're getting another.  Cockhole briquette. 
[00:03:00]  They could discover it's Mexican, part Mexican, or this or that.  And all of a sudden they're like, wait a minute.  I don't care what they are.  As long as they're boys.  Or they discover that the kid is broken, like in Rosie O'Donnell's case, and they want to send him back.  I'll take a lunatic, Tony.  Just as long as he can give me a rub and a tug.  Rub and a tug, Tony.  The big casino.  Yeah, so I think you're right.  I think she decided she can't handle this.  Right. 
[00:03:30]  No, I'm dead serious.  I read a lot of stuff on this, and this type of thing happens all the time.  It seems a little obvious that this is a woman who, in her life, is not satisfied, like something happened early on or whatever, that effed her up.  And she's trying to make herself happy and make up for it by adopting these kids.  Well, Anthony, her mom died at an early age.  So she needs to be a mother?  I don't know.  Or something?  I'm sure it deeply affected her losing the mom at an early age. 
[00:04:00]  Well, I guess other people have done that, and they don't feel the need to just scoop up children.  You know, you ever see, we talk about that movie all the time, Mommy Dearest.  Right.  Right?  Joan Crawford.  Yo, oh, hey, how you doing?  All right.  Good, good.  Yo, I know why Rosie got rid of her kids.  Yeah?  Yeah, she, the kid figured out the combination like the refrigerator.  Well, there you go.  Thank you.  Trying to have a serious conversation on adoption. 
[00:04:30]  No, like, you care, but...  Yeah, I think she's just doing this to make up for her own, you know, emotional problems.  Which I don't think is a good reason to be scooping up children.  I like, you know, she just wants a family.  You think that's it?  Gay people want families, too.  Hey, hey, you're making some kind of accusation here, allegations that have not been proven or have not, she hasn't come out and said anything about it.  I'm not talking about Rosie.  I just went off on a little tangent and said gay people want families, too. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, so you're saying that if a woman is gay...  Right.  ...that it's okay if she wants to adopt children.  Right.  All right.  But you have another twisted story as far as her and her kids go, right?  Yeah, the last of the Rosie trifecta.  Rosie O'Donnell was so eager for the love of her baby boy, Parker.  Remember her first and her favorite.  She makes that obvious.  So eager for the love of her baby boy, Parker.  She didn't bathe. 
[00:05:30]  Rosie didn't bathe, Hopi.  I read books, she says, that you should have a newborn baby who is adopted sleep on you and get used to your smell.  And that you shouldn't shower for a few days.  Rosie tells Barbara Walters, I guess, tonight.  She goes, I did it all.  So here's this poor, newly adopted kid.  That's child abuse.  That's child abuse.  So she didn't shower so the new kid could get used to Rosie's smell. 
[00:06:00]  So Rosie didn't shower.  This big, filthy woman laying in bed with this newborn, just like probably shoving its nose in her pit.  Smell me.  This is my smell.  I'm your mommy now.  I think the kid was down near the pink lettuce.  If you're not going to shower and you want your kid to smell.  Wouldn't it be the same if I just like kind of, you know, cram him up?  Because he's small.  And then deliver him. 
[00:06:30]  So then I'll be the real mommy.  Imagine that.  Some psycho woman tries to do that.  I have Dr. Newborn.  And then just jam him.  And then give birth.  You know what?  You remind me of a guy we talked about, talked to years ago, Dr. Mark Brown.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the lady that, she came in to the emergency room.  This guy has a whole bunch of sick stories from the ERs around the country.  She comes into the emergency room complaining of lower abdominal pains.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  So they go to an examiner.  They see that she has stitched her most intimate of areas shut.  Shut.  Like when you sew together the turkey after you put the stuffing in.  It's the same way.  Right.  Crudely stitched together.  Right.  So they snip it.  And after they snip it, they do a pelvic exam.  Mm-hmm.  They find she has jammed a small chicken in the most intimate of areas and sewed herself shut.  Because she believed if she did that, she couldn't have children, that she would actually 
[00:07:30]  would turn somehow into a baby and she could deliver it.  A cock.  Speaking about a rooster, Hopi.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Speaking about a rooster.  She may have heard that if you put a cock there, rooster, that something would happen.  Mm-hmm.  What, what am I reaching?  Oof.  Call me now.  You can't have children.  What you got to do, love, is get a chicken.  Put the chicken there. 
[00:08:00]  I will make sure it turns into a baby.  Lisa.  My cousin couldn't have any children, so she and her husband decided to adopt.  They adopted what they were told was an Italian baby.  Oh, Jesus.  Yep.  I'm telling you, this stuff happens all the time.  And later on, as the baby got older, they figured out that the baby wasn't a child.  Italian, but, like, in black.  Right.  Mama mia, we have a moony.  So what do they do?  Yeah, the family was a little upset.  So what do they do?  They kept the baby.  They kept the baby.  They kept the baby.  They loved the baby. 
[00:08:30]  It was Sicilian.  Probably.  Same thing.  All right, Lisa, thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Lisa.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I think Rosie's adopting all these kids to make up for the fact  that she's gay and she can't deal with it.  Well, we...  Probably also while she stuffed her face with hostess.  I don't think she's come out of the closet.  No, she hasn't come out of the closet.  If she is indeed gay.  We don't know for sure.  I know there is...  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  There's a lot of signs.  She hangs out at the WNBA games and I would... 
[00:09:00]  Is there one heterosexual woman that goes to WNBA games?  I don't know.  Well, I have a couple...  I have some friends who know her who are gay and they have rumored that she is gay.  Well, she has these women that go around with her and they're like companions.  I don't know.  And I have two other things to say.  Yeah.  One thing, she's got this big bruise on her hand.  Right.  And she's walking around showing everyone without abandon.  And she doesn't think it's going to get infected.  Oh, so you see Rosie a lot, right? 
[00:09:30]  No, I don't see Rosie a lot.  I'm saying on television.  She thinks she was on some show and she's flashing around this big scar, this big cut.  Well, of course she's going to get infected.  She doesn't have it covered up.  She was cutting the price tag off a fishing pole is what I heard?  Something like that.  That's what I heard.  I don't know.  I think she's a black guy.  Doesn't she just thrust her face in the water and pull the trout up as they jump out of the stream?  I've seen it happen.  And this poor kid that she sent back.  Like, now he's going to be, I mean, you see the children. 
[00:10:00]  They could grab them right when they jump.  I've seen it happen.  All right, Elisa.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks.  Tony.  What's up, boys?  Dude, you see that interview she did?  Disturbing.  What interview?  Where?  With Barbara Walters.  Yeah, I didn't see that.  I think it's Aaron today.  You watch the Barbara Walters adoption special?  Faggot.  Yeah, I'm a fag.  What?  Crumpet muncher.  Tell me that big waterhead ain't a crumpet muncher. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know.  Dude.  No.  All right, pick up her scent.  It must have smelled like big bacala in the sun, bro.  Bacala.  Whoa.  I love Dole Man Bacala, Tony.  Tony, toss my salad.  And I like lime with syrup.  My loyalties lie to you, my friends.  All right, Tony.  Later.  Bye.  I've never heard that before where you don't bathe so the adopted kid gets used to your smell.  Well, I learn something every day on this program.  She seems like the type that would try all that hokey stuff to get the love of these children 
[00:11:00]  that she's scooping up now, collecting them like trophies, and then giving back the busted ones.  You know something, Rosie?  It's part of parenthood.  How come when you adopt, you can just give them back when they're busted?  You have one?  If you're not Rosie O'Donnell and you're having a kid and all of a sudden you have and all of a sudden it's three years old  and it's acting like it's completely insane, you don't just give them back.  Deal with it.  Deal with it, fat girl. 
[00:11:30]  There's probably cricket.  They probably put her to the top of the list just because she's famous and has money.  Yeah.  So then it doesn't go your way, you give it back?  Deal with it.  The Ramseys did.  They dealt with it.  I'm not saying it's right.  But she wasn't adopted.  Exactly.  They couldn't just give it back.  They could give it back to God.  But the little kid didn't do anything. 
[00:12:00]  Wrong.  He gave the child back to God.  Why?  I'm doing something wrong.  It was doing something wrong.  It was making the mother look less hot.  I'm trying to follow the logic here.  The father...  What did that little kid do?  All right.  The father looks at JonBenet.  Right.  He's getting, like, excited.  The mother is looking like an old slob.  And she's getting jealous of the kid.  It's ruining the marriage.  Eliminate the problem.  Get the garret.  Get the carpet. 
[00:12:30]  Pull her up.  Why don't you call Boulder, Colorado and tell him you figured it out?  I did figure it out.  Everyone knows this is true, too.  Please.  Oh, it was the guy that was playing Santa the night before, The Neighbor.  Ah.  But now, Rosie, she could just give it back to the agency or something.  Right.  It's not what parenthood's all about there, Rosie.  You've got to deal with the lunatic kid that might scratch your newborn's eyes out.  Or the new adopted one.  No truth to the rumor that Rosie looked at, you know, the broken kid and said, 
[00:13:00]  You're the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Yeah, just toss it out.  Just toss the kid out.  Goodbye.  Don't like it.  Too much pressure.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  You're a cutie patootie, but goodbye.  Cutie patootie, but bye-bye.  Take the pictures down.  You weren't ever my kid.  We're hoping someday to have it back in the family.  Yeah, right.  You just picture a three-year-old going,  Ah! 
[00:13:30]  Ah!  Scratching you.  Yeah, I'm really hoping to get that back.  Oh, my God.  That's too bad.  Throw it to the Roddy.  Ted.  One woman did.  Hey, Ted.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good, Ted.  Yeah, I'm hoping to get her back.  I know that sound.  Hey, guys, I got five adopted of my own from all over the world.  You know what?  All sales are final.  All sales are final? 
[00:14:00]  I got a medicine cabinet full of Zoloft, Percocets, Ritalin.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  God knows what problems these kids came with.  They give you a paper and a picture and say, you want this kid?  And you're like, sure, okay.  And in two months, they're fine.  You adopted Asian kids?  A couple of Asians, a couple of Europeans, yeah.  What do you got, like Koreans?  Yeah, I got a couple of Koreans, I got a German girl, and I got a Chinese.  Look at this guy's collecting them. 
[00:14:30]  That's crazy.  Like Scotigo.  You're going to start your own massage parlor or what?  No, I was crazy about Risk.  Yeah, yeah, Risk.  That's it.  I just kept getting the cards.  I kept saying, yeah, I got to get one from that country.  So the kids look cute.  You adopted them, and now you're starting to find out that they have some problems.  Oh, sure.  And you can't send them back.  Oh, no.  If you were rich and famous, you could.  There was no return address on the package when they showed up.  Right.  And you got to be suspicious. 
[00:15:00]  They didn't even let me go over to the country to get them.  They delivered them.  Yeah, yeah, they bring them over.  Yeah, they bring them over and said, here, here's yours.  And then the person who handed it to you, like, turns around and disappears.  UPS.  Wait a minute.  Just sign for it.  They scan the sheet.  There you go.  That's it.  And you're like, uh, what do I do with it?  Here's your Korean.  All right.  Thank you, Ted.  Okay.  Bye.  Here's your Korean, Ted.  It's just like, um, it's like a puppy, Opie.  Puppy.  You go to the pound.  You pick yourself up a puppy, right?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:30]  And it's cute.  It's fun to play with.  Then all of a sudden, it craps on the floor, and it takes a leak, and it starts chewing on  your furniture.  And, uh, unless you can discipline it, and unless you want to put in the commitment, what  do you do?  Back to the pound.  Gas them.  Or you just chain it up, chain it up, uh, outside for the next 12 years.  Yeah.  See?  That's another thing.  Chain it up outside.  So you're all having fun inside during the winter.  Oh, yeah.  That's what the Ramseys did. 
[00:16:00]  That's what the Ramseys did.  But she doesn't want to come in.  Oh, you got us crying, kid.  Any parent that sit there and go, you effing hypocrite.  Oh, the kid's screaming and crying.  It's your fourth one.  What do you think?  You're going to get a whole batch of, uh, little angels?  You got to deal with it.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Scratching you.  I'd love to see that, Rosie.  Just, okay, okay.  I'm trying to love.  I'm trying to, you know what?  I mean, like alien. 
[00:16:30]  They're not Pokemon cards.  They're, uh, the little children.  All right.  Number three.  It reached an all-time low.  This is probably the wrongest thing we've ever choreographed in this studio.  The pot in the inside.  That is your rule. 
[00:17:00]  One, two, seven, four, WMW.  Look who's, uh, stopping by for a little visit today.  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  Bickery, bickery, bickery, too.  I ain't written a new joke since 82.  Oh!  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  How are you?  I'm great.  You have the worst luck, and I'll tell you why.  You always show up the day after, Ant and I do some just incredible, you know, blowout show  the night before, so we're just hungover, tired.  That's all you need, fresh blood. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Fresh attitude.  We're so vulnerable when you come in, because you always catch us when we're hungover.  Ah, you don't look too bad.  You don't look bad?  You look like crap.  Like 3.30, yeah.  I was up Salt Lake.  Why, you went to the Dice Show?  Well, we hosted the Dice Show.  Ah!  He gave us some time up there, Jeffrey.  I was with Dom Barris, one of his opening acts at 3 in the morning, getting wasted.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton, did he go on, too?  Oh, yeah.  Jim Norton killed.  Jim Norton killed.  Norton's very funny.  Funny guy. 
[00:18:00]  I was at Game 5 of the World Series.  You were there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't.  Yeah, it was really exciting, man.  It was really cool.  How are you doing?  It's exciting if you're a Yankee fan.  You know what?  People hate hearing this, but I really love the Mets and the Yankees.  You're one of those guys.  I saw a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.  I rooted for the Yankees.  I was in Shea last night.  The Mets were down.  I rooted for the Mets.  What's wrong with that?  New York, New York.  They named it twice.  You got to commit to a team.  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:18:30]  It was all about committing to a team for the Subway Series.  I would get pissed when I walk down the street and you see a store that says,  Go Yanks, and then in the other window, Go Mets.  Come on.  Make the choice.  Oh, we got to talk to Brewer.  Brewer owes me $1,000, by the way.  Yeah.  Is Brewer calling us today?  I don't know.  He was too drunk last night.  Yeah, Brewer called us really late.  He wasn't in his box seat.  That was weird.  It's shit.  No, he's in, like, Montreal or something.  Oh, yeah.  I usually see him in his box seat.  He's got tickets.  Jeffrey, we get back to the station like 1230 after the Dice Show, after watching the rest of the game,  and we're just getting our stuff to go our own ways and stuff. 
[00:19:00]  My phone rang, and it's Brewer just hammered from Montreal talking about the Mets.  And he promised he would call us today, but I don't know what's going on with that.  We got to bump you for a minute.  No, you can actually help us.  We got to talk to the robot from London Space.  Oh, my God.  Can I get some calls?  Is it the actual robot?  No, it's the guy.  It's Bob May.  Bob May.  You're on, Bob.  Hello there.  How you doing, Bob?  Pretty good.  Who is this, Anthony?  Both of us are here, Anthony and Opie. 
[00:19:30]  All right, Opie.  Yeah.  Now, you guys are coming over to see our show, I hope.  Oh, get the plug in right away.  You're damn right.  I'm not going to fool around, you see, because my big friend is Big Kev.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I mean, he's very good with all the stars in Hollywood.  Wait, I've just been informed you're not even the voice guy.  You're just the guy.  All right, now, wait.  Let me explain everything.  You're just the guy that was in the robot?  No, a guy.  Listen to this.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm the actor who was the one that created the part.  I did all the dialogue with Jonathan Harris. 
[00:20:00]  And, in fact, there's some funny stories about Jonathan and I.  Oh, dear, I bet you.  Oh, yes.  Oh, the pain.  Yeah, boy.  Now, Opie, I want to hear a good...  No, it's Anthony.  I want to hear an imitation of Jonathan.  He was just doing it.  Oh, that wasn't Jonathan.  Shut up, you bubble-headed boobie.  Very Jonathan.  Worked very simply as our announcer.  You clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Well, don't forget bubble-headed boobie, please.  Thought I just said that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, that...  Well, never in fear.  Smith was there.  Now, wait a minute.  You did the trading, the little banter with Jonathan Harris.  All that on the soundstage, and weeks later in post-production,  our announcer would loop over the top of my line.  Oh, so you're not even famous.  But you're not the guy.  You're nobody.  Hey, don't start with me, baby.  I'm from New York.  I did Broadway.  I'll pick your buzz.  I want to hear the robot.  What happened?  Why can't we speak with the robot?  All right, listen, guys.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  I'm in Australia with our announcer.  We're doing a public appearance.  And we're on the radio station with this DJ.  And so Dick Tufelt, who was our announcer,  and I drove the poor DJ nuts because I said,  Warning.  And he went, Warning.  And the guy says, Who the hell's doing this?  So we did the whole show that way.  Hello, that was a joke.  Hey, guys, why don't you just save time? 
[00:21:30]  Can we just pass out some night cooling on the studio?  Where'd you find this guy?  Hey, no, listen.  You guys are big fans of Jonathan.  Oh, boy.  He's a great guy.  Did you ever see him touch young William?  Well, I saw him.  He's always grabbing him from behind.  Woo!  We were doing a scene one day where Jonathan had to polish the robot.  Yeah.  So a thing he lost is set.  Polish the robot.  So he was polishing the robot, and I said, Lower. 
[00:22:00]  And he got lower.  And I said, Lower.  He got even lower.  Finally, he dropped his hand lower, and I turned right around to him,  and I said, I love you.  Hello?  Hello?  Just a guy.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Wait, wait, Bob.  I can't get past the fact that you're not the guy.  Yes, I am.  You were just the guy in the suit.  Don't start with me.  Were you actually in the suit?  Yeah.  Now, are you a man of short stature? 
[00:22:30]  Yes, I am.  And how tall would you be?  I am 5'6".  Okay.  And did you move it around in there?  Yeah.  I did everything with it.  In fact, Irwin Allen allowed Jonathan Harris and myself to create our own characterization.  What's your claim to fame?  I mean, you didn't even walk.  Oh, yes, I did.  Was it on a wheel thing?  No, when it was in the full outfit, they pulled it with cables because the thing weighed 350 pounds.  They pulled it with cables?  And then sometimes I would carry the top section, which weighed 250 pounds. 
[00:23:00]  I would carry that on a parachute-type harness.  And just when we thought we were a big deal, we were at the garden in front of 11,000 people.  Yeah.  This shows how pathetic we still are.  We can't even get the guy that does the robot boy from Lost in Space.  Who's his agent?  Forrest Lawn, how old is it?  Who is the agent?  William Morris.  That's Forrest Lawn.  That's the damn tour.  But the actual William Morris.  That's the guy.  So, hey, what have you done lately?  What have I done lately? 
[00:23:30]  Well, since Lost in Space, I did several Jerry Lewis films, of course.  Wow.  That'll get you a few laughs.  They're definitely Lost in Space.  Oh, I'm lost and you believe it.  What do you ask a guy that was just in a suit and didn't do the voice?  Yeah.  You ever fart in the costume?  No, but I'll tell you this.  Mark Goddard and Bill Moomey locked me in there for lunch.  Two things happened.  Well, yeah.  Number one, my wife knew where I was every moment.  And second of all, I had nothing else to do, so I lit up a cigarette and I was smoking in her. 
[00:24:00]  When I only came on the set, saw smoke coming out of it, went for the fire extinguisher.  And it didn't happen, of course.  But from then on, any time smoke had to come out of the robot, they had to be a cigar.  You want a really uncomfortable radio?  Yeah.  Let's just not say anything anymore until he hangs up.  Okay.  Check it out with Mark Goddard.  All right.  That's, wow.  What else can you tell us?  What else can I tell you?  Yeah, hey.  Well, I, as a robot, you know, I have a great memory because my computer banks will focus on all different things. 
[00:24:30]  So now I have a memory of you guys, and I expect to see your asses out here at the convention.  If you're not out here, I'll send Dr. Smith to do what he's done to many of us.  Now, since you have such a busy schedule, and dialogue is at a rarity, I must go because I've got to get down to the fans. 
[00:25:00]  But I really appreciate being on your show, and I look forward to you coming out and being online.  All right, guys, and remember, if you want a star, get a hold of Big Ken.  Kev does it all.  All right, thanks.  Hey, guys, it's Big Kev.  I have never felt more like a Met my entire life.  My God. 
[00:25:30]  All right, say something.  Ping pong balls, anything.  Whatever, Ben.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, I am friggin' sweating.  I'm cringing.  That is awful.  Now, Big Ken's got to be like, oh, the show, you know.  Sometimes the zipper would get stuck.  Other times.  One time I put the right leg on backwards, and I had to start over again and put the left leg on.  One time I was lost in Cleveland. 
[00:26:30]  One time I was lost in Trenton, New Jersey.  I've never been lost in space.  Not really.  However, well, actually, two costumes.  One I would make for public appearances.  We had to do that same interview with the guys that were in the Star Wars suits. 
[00:27:00]  I was like, what do you ask them?  Yeah, when the movie came out, the last movie came out, Star Wars 1, all the guys who are not in the most recent Star Wars movie were here.  Like, Boba Fett.  The guy that was in R2-D2.  The guy that played Darth Vader.  The Wookie.  And the Darth Vader guy.  Right.  And we didn't know what to ask him, because all they were were the guys in the suits.  And it turned out he was only the Darth Vader one in the, like, third one.  Like, it wasn't even the first Darth Vader guy. 
[00:27:30]  It was like the third one.  Interesting enough.  Interesting enough.  The suits today are flame retarded.  One time I was smoking a cigar.  In between takes.  In between takes.  It was episode number 72.  Where we get lost in space.  And an air smell on my leg.  Now, these suits today, they're flame retarded. 
[00:28:00]  But I lost a pole that day.  Irwin Allen came over to me and said, where's your show?  The great Irwin Allen.  The great Irwin Allen.  Not to be confused with Marty Allen, Steve Allen, Herb Allen, Paul Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Allen.  Poor Allen.  And then he has to go, well, uh, well, I gotta go. 
[00:28:30]  I gotta go.  Wait, someone's pissed at us.  Come on, that was funny.  Kathy, what's up?  You guys are so mean.  What?  Oh, my God.  This guy has the littlest claim to fame, and you totally killed him.  We thought we were getting the voice, you know.  And through the voice, we thought we had the guy.  Oh, my God.  Learning, arming, little Robinson.  That poor little old guy.  Now, he's all upset, and you guys are laughing, and then you try to make it up by saying, go see his show. 
[00:29:00]  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Kathy.  I was putting one of my hip bands in your ass.  Anyway, it was pretty funny, though, listening to Ted's face.  But at the same time, you guys are mean.  Love you.  See you.  All right, bye.  He was lost in space.  He was.  A lot of people were saying that.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Dan.  Get Big Kev back on the phone, by the way.  Dan.  Yeah, I want to see what the aftermath of that debacle was. 
[00:29:30]  Hello, Dan?  You going all right?  Well, Bob made the guy that was in the robot suit.  Big Kev is going to have to kill a few more children and bury them in his basement to make up for the aggravation of that call.  Yeah.  I'll call you, Opie, and you, Anthony, and now I'm going to kill you both.  All right.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, the actual robot would be funnier than that guy.  Well, possibly, yeah.  I resent that.  Anyway.  It's easy putting on that costume every day for 60 straight years. 
[00:30:00]  How many times can you tell people how much it weighed and how many pieces it was in?  When I see these actors like Jim Carrey in his Grinch costume, it's reminding me of the day that Erwin Allen and I were lost on the Jersey Turnpike going to this for Cocter Convention.  I go, and one more guy called me Mr. Spock. 
[00:30:30]  And I go, I go, but you don't, you didn't even walk in the costume.  Well, we had a movie.  No, you didn't.  Cables would drag him around.  And he'd just stand inside his thing.  So it's not even like body mannerisms.  What about the arms?  They used to wave around.  When he would go, warning, warning, warning.  And then he would talk like, warning, warning.  Hey, Smith, wax me.  And then they'd have the guy overlay, hey, Dr. Smith, please shine my armor. 
[00:31:00]  But he'd be, ah.  I had 15 minutes of pain.  Unfortunately, my face was covered.  You know, why would you put yourself in that position?  People are going to show up and go, wow, do the voice.  Well, I don't do the voice.  I don't do the voice.  I was just in the suit.  You know every single person. 
[00:31:30]  Every single person that goes there that wants to see the robot is going to ask them to do the voice.  I didn't do the voice.  But the costume weighs 500 pounds, and it was pulled by a cable system.  One time I was smoking.  They didn't even trust me to walk.  They had to pull me with a cable.  They pulled me with pull these.  These kids today, Alf and Chewbacca, they don't know what it was like.  Actors strike my ass.  Byron Allen, Debbie Allen, Allen from Scooby-Doo. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  Damn, that was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeffrey Ross in studio.  Yeah.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Dr. Zachary Smith.  Was there any sex on Austin Space?  Yes.  Was there any sex on Austin Space?  I have to tell you, but you're very long.  Ouch, but it's not very naughty, naughty. 
[00:32:30]  Opie and absentee.  Oh, you boys are dangerous.  I have to watch it.  Naughty.  Oh, dear.  I'm not a puppet.  And of course, you're right.  Naughty.  Young William.  I have to tell you, but you're very long.  Very naughty.  Oh, are you having fun with our little radio show today, Dr. Zachary Smith?  We played a little game.  That was fun.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, they're both lovely babies, my dear.  1027-WNE-W.  Booyahs. 
[00:33:00]  Autolite de Strauss Discount Auto.  Good luck.  Yeah, I said, good luck putting that together, Steve.  That's it, right there, huh?  Yeah, that is the Spanish fake Fred Flintstone, Mike from Newark.  That's messed up.  Anthony dropped the Chalupa.  Everybody's a smart ass.  How do you say Bosch wiper blades in Spanish?  Does Anthony flip out in Spanish also? 
[00:33:30]  Can you please say you have very large American penis?  Yeah, you don't even know what you said.  It could have been us just goofing on you.  Right.  You probably just said some like...  Like I'm a momo or something.  Right, right.  All right, we got the final product.  It sounds like the Japanese woman from Jim Pokemon South Park episode.  Here's how it's going to sound on this show.  I'm serious.  This is dead serious.  Here it is.  If Strauss picks up your car sale, you'll find big savings on all your car needs. 
[00:34:00]  It's all fed up.  That's great.  Good job, Steve.  You're doing it, Jeff.  Steve, cue that up again.  I got to hear it one more time.  It actually sounds like you know Spanish now.  That's hilarious. 
[00:34:30]  Come on.  Steve's going to cue it up again.  Oh, that is funny.  That's great.  He wanted me to do it, so, you know, I'll give it a try.  It's the magic of radio.  He made it sound like you know Spanish.  Anthony talks like a kid trying to read in an after school special.  You've got to screw yourself.  I'm a total from New York. 
[00:35:00]  Check it in.  What?  Bomb the harbor?  Here's that one more time.  Speaking Spanish.  This selection of parts and accessories anywhere.  And right now, during the Strauss pick up your car sale, you'll find big savings on all your car needs.  It's all choppy, man.  God damn, Steve.  That's funny, man. 
[00:35:30]  That was awful, going in there and just like, you know, magnifying the whole thing and picking out the little words.  Oh, my God.  Rico.  What is this one?  What is this one?  Rico.  Rico.  Yeah.  Bugia.  Otolite. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  Canteza de cobra.  Cobre.  I didn't say 59.  Oh, great.  Exactly.  Bujías.  Bujías, right?  Okay.  Bujías Autolight.  Con cabeza de cobre. 
[00:36:30]  Ah.  Ah.  59 centavos con el envío del cupón de reembolso de 30 centavos.  Have fun.  Night from Jersey.  It sounds like the friggin' warnings at the Disney ride.  It sounded like Japanese speaking Spanish. 
[00:37:00]  That was funny stuff.  Even Spanish-speaking people didn't understand that.  It's like Rocky dubbed into Spanish on Telemundo.  You know?  Anthony sounds like Spanish robot.  Yeah.  Ah, that's pretty funny.  That's pretty funny.  Anthony needs a ton of Hispanics. 
[00:37:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's pretty funny.  When does Dr. Smith's robot speak in Spanish?  Ha, ha, ha.  Warning.  Ed wants to know, Anthony, if you miss your menudo days.  Yes.  Why did you say you like the man joke?  Ha, ha, ha.  I don't believe that was in the copy.  You don't know for sure.  Now, you're saying you know Spanish.  You took six years of Spanish opening, and you can read this tag.  Ah, yes, Anthony.  Okay. 
[00:38:00]  Six years, so.  Read the tag.  We're going to make Harborfield's high school very proud here.  Go ahead.  Esta semana en Strauss Discount Auto, fueas Autolite con cabeza de cobre a cincuenta y nueve centavos con el envío del coupon de reembolso de trienta centavos.  Okay.  That's a little better than you.  At least I was trying to put on the wacky voice.  Oh, para incender y acceder su auto suavemente, nada se compara a las poejas Autolite de Strauss Discount Auto. 
[00:38:30]  All right, I'm just as bad.  And the pathetic thing is I took six years, you took none, and we're the same.  I don't know what I just said either.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW. 
[00:39:00]  212-757-1027, Anthony.  Remember when we did the, we stood out in the driving range at the golf course.  We dressed up in hockey equipment and other stuff and stood out on the driving range.  Would you consider this the wackiest fit we've ever done?  We try not to do wacky fits.  This was probably one of the zaniest things we've done.  Yes, a little wacky for us, but it was cool.  It was for like a charity.  You know what?  And this was before Jackass, and we have video that they would play on MTV tomorrow because 
[00:39:30]  it was pretty sick.  But I remember I was so scared of getting hit in the junk that I took a big steel frying  pan and duct taped it right off of my crotch.  And I will never forget the sound it made and the relief I felt when one of the shots,  a lying shot, man, right off the frying pan.  It made a bong sound.  I looked down and saw when I had a duct tape, it hit the duct tape and made like a hole  in the duct tape where the golf ball hit. 
[00:40:00]  And it was right where my sack was.  Now, you guys don't understand how scary this was.  We were in full like hockey goalie gear, frying pans on our junk.  We had every inch of our body covered with chest, arms, heavy, heavy pads.  We stood about 100 to 120 yards away, and we had...  How'd it be 50 guys?  I was going to say like 40.  All right, 40 or 50 guys all hitting golf balls at the same time with us.  And some of them real ringers.  I mean, that could slam these balls.  The line shots that just stay five feet off the ground for 200 yards. 
[00:40:30]  All those things that just whoo, they defy gravity.  You see it coming at you, but it's coming so fast, there's no way you can move.  And it hits you, and you're just convinced you're dead.  Yeah.  No joke.  You're like, I'm done.  Then you're amazed.  And then you're like, wow, that didn't hurt.  It's really bizarre.  The first one that hits you, you're all scared and stuff.  And then the first one that hits you, you're like, oh, wow, that didn't hurt.  But it's going to hurt when it hits me on the kneecap or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the ones that would just whiz by our head? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  And you would hear the sound of...  Oh, my God, it's a TIE fighter.  Yeah.  That was pretty scary, though.  Maybe we'll have to pull something wacky out like that again, Opie.  I don't know how wacky it is, because it was really scary.  Yeah.  It was fun for the people that were doing it.  And there were times we got hit, it knocked us right over. 
[00:41:30]  Like, boom, we were, you know, knocked right over.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Yeah.  We can do it again.  We did it for a charity.  It was for a good cause.  We raised a lot of money.  Yeah, and like I said, it was fun for the people that were doing it.  I mean, if you're at a driving range, what would be more fun than aiming at people?  Yeah.  Really?  You know, who hasn't taken shots at the poor ball collector guy in the little caged golf cart?  And remember, we started like 200 yards out, because even though we were like, you know, 
[00:42:00]  had all this padding on, we were still scared.  And then Dan and I, we got a little braver, and we kept moving up, moving up,  and we got about 100, 110 yards away was our closest.  Yeah.  It was just insane.  Insane.  It's so funny when you take a shot on the course, and you see your balls going to somebody.  Poor!  Stupid thing to yell.  Oh, how about look out!  Oh, yes!  And the thing's just going right for them, and they're just standing there, 
[00:42:30]  and you see the whole thing happening.  That lands a foot away from them, and they give you that what-the-eff look.  And then they're horrible.  They either step on your ball and hit it back to you.  Yeah.  Jeff.  I'm really terrible at it, so I don't know where the ball's going.  It's coming right for us!  I don't know where it's going after I hit it.  So I just say, hey, look out.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys, I'd pay some good money to knock a few balls at you.  That'd be hysterical.  Yeah, was it called, what was it, take a shot at Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, because we'd take a shot at everyone else.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  It was the gag.  Your chance to get revenge.  You could do it like, you know, 50 bucks for Gabe Marco, you know, 100 bucks for Stinky,  you know, 500 bucks for you guys.  You know, I would consider doing it again.  It was scary, but I would do it again.  And those shots five feet off the ground?  Worm burners.  Yeah, I know.  Dicious.  Thanks, Jeff.  Take it easy, guys.  Okay.  Wait a second.  You mean a Boston charity actually accepted donations from your show?  Yeah.  How's that for a topper?  From Cheryl.  Someone that pays attention.  Ho, ho, ho! 
[00:43:30]  How's that for a topper?  Ho, ho!  Charities usually don't take our money.  Which amazes me.  I mean, we've talked about it.  It's just amazes me.  Yeah, and do you want to take free money?  We try to do a charity.  No one ever wants our money.  So screw it.  Now we just go out and have fun.  Like our road show is coming up.  Really fast.  When we were putting out Demented World, we had a part of charity.  And what was it, the Jimmy Fund, Ben?  The Jimmy Fund, who solicits donations in movie theaters. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, you'd be sitting in a movie, waiting for the movie to start.  The lights would come up.  Someone walks in front of the theater and goes, hi, I'm blah, blah, blah from the Jimmy Fund.  We're going to send a couple of people to walk around to guilt you into using your remaining Jujubee money to help cure Jimmy.  Right.  So we contact the Jimmy Fund because we're in Boston, and that's the hometown, I think, of the Jimmy Fund, right?  All right.  Did you say Jujubee?  No.  I'm going to get to the Shwoogie story in a second here. 
[00:44:30]  Shwoogie?  Remember the Shwoogie story?  What?  The Shwoogie?  We won't say who said it, but we've got to tell the story.  Bruce Mittman, why?  All right.  Good.  So we approached the Jimmy Fund.  We're like, hey, we're going to put out this CD.  It's going to sell like hotcakes.  We're going to make a lot of money.  We'll give you, I think it was like a dollar or two bucks a CD.  We're going to just give to the Jimmy Fund.  It's like getting 50 grand for nothing.  50?  It was over 100.  For a dollar a CD.  Yeah, it was over 100,000 in the end. 
[00:45:00]  Jimmy Fund said, no, they didn't want to take our money.  So we're sitting there like, you'd rather, you know, watch kids suffer with the cancer and stuff than take our money.  It made them alike.  Yeah.  They proved by their actions they would rather have children suffering with cancer than accept Opie and Anthony's money.  Over 100 grand.  Yeah.  We were just floored that they wouldn't take our money.  So we started calling other charities in Boston.  No one would take our money.  Nope.  To make a long story short, Demented World, if you look closely on the labeling of our CD, 
[00:45:30]  that's like three years old now, the charity we finally found was the Minority Homeless Veterans Association.  Not even the homeless vets.  It was the Minority Homeless Vets.  Minority Homeless Vets.  Of Boston.  Of Boston.  It's not even for New York.  No.  They got...  There's so many minorities in Boston.  They got all the money.  They got all the money.  Because that was the only charity that would take it. 
[00:46:00]  And the check presenting.  Um...  Ceremony.  Right.  With our boss.  We didn't have to go, but, uh, yeah, we sold a ton of the CDs and it was time to, you know,  pay the Minority Homeless Veterans of Boston.  The big check.  The big check.  So our GM at the time, Bruce Mittman, has to go down to their, uh, their, their, their local headquarters.  Present that five foot by two foot big photo op check.  Now, he was pissed off at us at the time for something.  I don't even remember. 
[00:46:30]  We were getting in a lot of trouble back then.  We just never got it back then, especially.  So, so, we're doing our radio show and we'll, and Bruce Mittman comes walking into the, uh,  the studio with the big check.  And he goes, I don't know why I'm doing this for you guys, but...  I gotta present this check to a bunch of shwuggies.  Oh!  Shwuggies!  When he said that, I lost it.  And the picture of the... 
[00:47:00]  Boys, but here's this little Jewish guy.  Yeah, the picture...  I swear to God, he's three feet tall.  The picture, it's out there somewhere.  I don't think it made the main papers, but like a local paper.  Yeah.  There's a picture of, uh, our, our midget GM, because he was like, like Anthony said, about  five, two, five, three, sitting there, putting on a fake smile, uh, surrounded by a bunch  of shwuggies with these holding...  Shwuggies!  With these holding the big check.  These are like some ancient Tuskegee Airmen pilots that are just like family going, I  remember back on P-51, I was in on a Mustang, went on or something, me and our squadron of 
[00:47:30]  the shwuggies swept down on the goddamn driving.  I'm back there for the future.  Let me tell you about it.  We win the war.  And, and, and there's this three-foot little Jewish guy going, boys, boys.  I don't know how I get stuck presenting the check to the shwuggies, but...  The shwuggies?  I will never forget that word.  Hey, it was Boston.  Everyone talked about that.  Screen name up for grabs today.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  I don't even know how do you spell shwuggies. 
[00:48:00]  Boys, boys, my shwuggies.  That guy was, that guy was classic, man.  Shwuggie.  Let me tell you something.  I remember a storm on the beaches.  The guy would just, like, we'd have these just rocking shows with corn and limp biscuits.  The boys.  He'd be backstage smoking pot with us.  This guy was the most, like, business guy, but he was a midget.  And he drove this big friggin' suburban.  He had the biggest car in Boston because, because he was so short.  And we used to joke on the air that he needed a stepladder to get into it and stuff. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, you'd see the door open and one of those rope ladders unroll.  No joke, because he looked ridiculous behind this, behind the wheel of this truck.  Yeah, and then at the shows, because we used to do a lot of the parties with the bands and stuff up there.  Corn plated a few and stuff.  And there's Brucie just partying it up like a madman with everybody.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Any pot boys?  Boys.  That's what he called us.  Boys. 
[00:49:00]  B-b-b-boys.  Boys, uh, have you seen Ozone?  I need some pot boys.  Boys.  He lived in the nicest town.  Yeah, he lived in a really, like, snootin', highfalutin' area where there were no shwuggies at all.  No.  No shwuggies.  Here he is.  Ooh, ooh.  I'll never forget him walking into that studio that day with a big check.  I gotta present this check to the shwuggies.  Shwuggies.  Ha, ha, ha.  Is that horrid? 
[00:49:30]  He sounded like Ted Knight.  Boy.  He definitely sounded like Ted Knight.  I gotta bring it to the shwuggies.  You're right.  Ha, ha, ha.  Is that clear?  All right, Carl, what's up?  Hey, I know where the term four came from.  I don't know about shwuggie, but I can tell you where four came from.  Yeah.  He used to work at a golf course during college with this old Scottish guy.  He's kind of like that McTavish from Caddyshack.  Yeah.  He says the Scots used to...  No, you're a geek!  That's right.  You know, that go for it. 
[00:50:00]  Go for it, Denny.  Ha, ha, ha.  He used to fire cannons when they'd fight between the clans, and before they'd shoot them, they'd yell before the cannons.  So the guys would duck.  After a while, they'd get tired of yelling before the cannons.  They'd just say, for the cannons.  And then finally, they'd get four, and then they'd stop shooting at each other and start playing golf and yell, four.  So, not a lot of yucks, but that's exactly what it's called.  Well, there you go.  How about that?  You know, in those days, they called it golf without the L.  Golf without the L.  I haven't seen that movie in two weeks. 
[00:50:30]  It was given to me by the Knights of St. Andrews.  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Swoogie.  It looks like a wreck.  It's in the hole!  Uh, let's go to Steve.  A lot of Steve's checking in today.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm laughing my ass off over here.  The proper pronunciation for that word, the Yiddish derivative of that is Swoogie.  Swoogie?  Yeah, yeah, Swoogie.  But he was a Swoogie, Swoogie, Swoogie.  Swoogie, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Um, it's a Yiddish word.  Basically, the best, uh, interpretation, it means shadow.  Slang word for blackmail.  I gotta give this big check, boys, to the shadows.  Yeah, you got you.  We'll pick that.  The Swoogies.  You know, we never told that story on the air, because Brucey was unbelievable.  Yeah, because here we are doing a nice thing for the minority homeless vets of Boston.  What about the time we had a meet with the gay guys?  We had a meeting with three guys from the gay, lesbian, uh, you know, GLAAD, or whatever. 
[00:51:30]  And because of some of the gay-oriented, uh, things we were doing on the show.  What gay bit?  Oh, I know what gay bit.  Can we play the bit?  Which one was it?  Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  All right, hold on.  Mom!  Hold on.  I'm a rope-swallow-er.  And we'll take a break.  We'll take a break.  We'll get into that story.  And, uh, Bruce's, uh, name for the, uh, for the gay guys.  Oh, there was another group we had to meet with.  We were always meeting with groups, but he's like, I know, but, boys, we have to meet with the faggots. 
[00:52:00]  He's trying to make it seem like it's this big thing.  Faggots.  I just hope there's no shwoogie faggots.  All right, we'll tell that story next.  Stay there.  And play Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1027 WNEW.  New York to do some business, and we had him on the air. 
[00:52:30]  He's like, how are my boys?  I wish I would have heard him.  Boys.  We'll try to dig up some tape on him.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  Boys, some gooks are calling, complaining about some of your various Asian bids.  You know, as we were kind of getting our thoughts together during commercials, and I'm thinking about it,  and things are coming back to my memory that I blocked out.  Because this was just one of those things that I didn't want to be part of.  It was horrible.  We walked out.  We walked out.  We did walk out.  After they brought Billy. 
[00:53:00]  Little Billy.  All right.  All right, little Billy.  Stop it.  We showed we had hearts that day.  Oh.  We finally reached our limit.  Boys.  Like, boys, boys.  He was always trying to run block for us in his own inimitable little way, the little midget.  And it would be all PC in front of the person, but then he'd turn around and, you know, call them shwuggies or faggots.  The faggots have left, boys. 
[00:53:30]  You can resume bashing the faggots.  Well, we finally come to the famous prank.  Yeah, when we did that mayor thing, said the mayor was dead and we were on the verge of getting fired.  We didn't get fired that day.  It went a good week before they actually fired us.  So in that week, Brucie is trying to do damage control.  Now, this, it's not working.  The mayor was so pissed off, but they came up with this idea. 
[00:54:00]  Well, you've got to tell everyone that they hired a PR firm.  Yeah, they hired a PR firm just for this, to try to make us look good.  To make us look good and put out the fire so we could keep our jobs and continue rocking Boston.  Now, if you remember, Opie, when we got in trouble, Brucie and Dada Dave got together and decided that they were going to approach the mayor, Mayor Menino, and say,  Look, the same mayor that we just told everyone died in a car accident, April Fool's. 
[00:54:30]  Look, we'll go into Boston, put the boys in those stocks, those old stocks where you put your head and your arms through and you're locked in there.  And the mayor that we said was dead will throw pies at the boys' face.  And everything will be okay after that.  And then that's fine.  This is the idea that Dada Dave came up with.  So that's all okie-dokie.  He told the midget, look, I can handle this.  I've got a great way to get us out of this, man.  Great way to get us out of trouble.  Oh, yeah.  We had news crews camping outside our residence. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And this is going to take care of it.  Just a bunch of our listeners and the mayor throwing pies at our faces.  We're in a stockade.  So get to this.  Get this.  Before they even check with the mayor or us or anything, Dada Dave goes and orders about 500 pies.  500 big cream pies.  Real pies.  Not whipped cream and tinfoil pie tints.  Real pies.  He wanted us to get hurt.  They were like big lemon meringue pies.  Apple pies.  The reason why the old pie gag works is because all it is is whipped cream. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  But he, no, real pies.  He's going to throw real pies at us.  500 pies he orders.  So now we get on the air when we find out about this.  Yeah, go ahead.  The next day.  I just got to jump in.  Because we didn't really get fired April 1st.  We did the show.  We were on the next day.  April 2nd.  April 2nd.  We start getting wind of this pie scheme.  So we go off and say, we're not doing this.  We are not going to go in stocks and have pies thrown at us by anybody. 
[00:56:00]  Dave comes running in all pissed off.  You don't tell me what you're going to do.  I'm trying to get damage control here.  This is off the air.  He starts yelling at us.  I'm trying to help you guys out and do damage control.  You don't get on the air and say you're not doing that.  And you're so tame.  Oh, he was screaming.  You don't tell me.  It was.  Because I said so.  All raging pissed off.  500 pies he orders.  It was Davey.  It was Davey Dearest. 
[00:56:30]  Davey Dearest.  Because he was screaming there.  You get hit with these pies.  Because he was screaming in that same cadence.  Yeah.  Brucey, get the pies.  And you know what, Ed?  I have that audio on at that somewhere.  And to this day, I cannot find it.  It drives me nuts.  Probably the most valuable piece of tape since the Nixon Watergate tape.  Without a doubt.  And I will find it eventually.  Yeah.  But before you move on with the story. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Now, if we back up here.  We told you guys that they hired a PR firm, right?  Mm-hmm.  The midget, Bruce Mittman, who loves the shruggy so much.  Boys, boys.  Remember what he did to the mayor?  He looked up the mayor's schedule.  Yeah.  Because it was all about damage control and then putting out the fires.  So Bruce Mittman figures if he could get a picture of himself shaking the mayor's hand.  Oh, right.  Because what the PR firm does is they have their...  No, this is a true story.  They have their own camera crew and stuff. 
[00:57:30]  So they'll go to events, take pictures, and then they'll put it in the paper.  This story was so hot, it was...  It was...  He hired basically paparazzi.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, any paper in the New England area would buy this photo of the general manager  of the station that just pulled the most amazing, sickest, ridiculous prank shaking the mayor's hand.  Uh-huh.  It was gold.  So, freaking the midget finds out the mayor's schedule.  I'm looking up the mayor's schedule, boys. 
[00:58:00]  I will fix this for you.  The fat Dago will be very happy.  So he camps out where the mayor's going to do an appearance or whatever, whatever he was doing.  I forget exactly.  The mayor comes out of his little meeting.  There's Bruce Mittman, runs right up to him.  And there's the paparazzi.  Yeah.  Even though it was a PR firm, but it was a paparazzi guy going...  Snapping pics.  Snapping pictures like crazy.  Yes, it was in all the Boston papers the next day. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Bruce Mittman shaking the hand of the mayor.  Which infuriated the mayor.  Infuriated.  Because the mayor had no idea who the midget was.  He thought he was just shaking, you know, just a regular schmo's hand.  He thought I was welcoming him to Munchkinland, boys.  Boys.  Boys.  So that infuriated the mayor as well.  So now they finally check.  Dada Dave now calls the mayor's office and says, I have 500 pies.  I have the boys.  We're going to do this, right? 
[00:59:00]  And the mayor's office just goes, are you out of your effing mind?  Do you think we're just going to take our anger with them and what they did and how they hurt the mayor's family  and turn it into some wacky radio stunt prank thing?  No.  Take your pies and shove them up your ass.  That's pretty much what they said.  Yeah.  So now, 500 pies ordered.  Opie and Anthony in trouble.  Damage control not working. 
[00:59:30]  PR firm.  PR firm phase two now.  Right.  Okay.  We'll take lemons.  Make lemonade.  We got 500 pies.  What can we do with 500 pies?  We'll send Opie and Anthony to the Children's Cancer Hospital to deliver the pies to the little dying children.  Like, that's what...  A great photo effing op mother effer.  Yeah, that's what dying kids want.  Pies.  So now we're going to use kids with cancer to try to make it so O&A can keep their goddamn jobs. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  And we were so...  You know, we've got to say it.  We were so shell-shocked.  We kind of just went with it.  We were going wherever they said at that point.  And we're just, what?  Yeah.  Okay.  Every hour, they're running promos on the news.  Updates on where we are.  What we're doing.  How does the mayor feel?  When are they going to get fired?  Are they fired?  Who knows?  This is our lives, and we're just like freaking out.  We were like Stepford DJs.  We were just like, oh, okay.  All right.  Whatever.  The flow.  And we really didn't know what they were doing.  They go, just be at this hospital at this time.  There's going to be a photographer there.  So we're like, okay. 
[01:00:30]  They didn't tell us about the cancer hospital.  I think, all right.  There's a kid with a broken leg.  We'll shove a pie in his arm, and we'll leave.  Right.  I don't know.  We go there.  This stuff is done all the time, by the way, by these PR people.  Oh, yeah.  When you see some schlep jock standing there with, you know, hugging little crack babies,  you think he wakes up and goes, well, I think I'm going to go hug some crack babies today.  No, that guy has a story to tell.  And he's trying to get himself out of some trouble.  Right.  So in most cases, I'm sure there's good-hearted souls. 
[01:01:00]  We go to this hospital.  There's the truck, 500 pies, and in the truck.  And they start bringing them in.  They start bringing in the pies.  We're in the lobby of the hospital.  Now, the people that worked at the cancer hospital, they didn't know the whole story.  They really didn't know who we were at this point.  No.  They really thought that you and I and the radio station was doing a good deed.  That's all they knew at first.  Now we're standing around waiting for the photographers.  Right.  And they got the pies just loaded all the way up to the ceiling. 
[01:01:30]  Pies, pies, pies.  As far as the photo op goes, it was quite impressive.  So now they go, okay, let's start bringing the children in.  Right.  Like, all right.  So like I said, a kid with a broken leg.  At this point, we still think it's just a regular.  Oh, look at that.  Little Mary just got her consoles taken out.  How cute.  Hopefully you can enjoy the lemon meringue.  But you can't eat the crust.  Your throat still hurts.  They start wheeling out kids with the clumps of hair coming out.  The baldy heads. 
[01:02:00]  Look, dude.  We're not telling the story for a joke.  No, this is what's happening.  So I'm looking at it over like, oh my God, these are dying kids.  No, no, no, no, no.  But I got it back.  We did not know at first.  We're still thinking, well, okay, they're in bad shape.  No, I'm looking, and in my head, I'm thinking, oh my God, they're dying kids.  I'll tell you when I found out.  When?  All of a sudden, even though this was like April 5th or so, okay, all the kids are around the pie stacked up to the ceiling. 
[01:02:30]  We're still waiting for the photographer.  That was the reason we just waited so long.  And all of a sudden, there's little Mary, looking just like Cindy Lou Who, and she's like the leader of the cancer kids.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, they're like little impish little kids.  Sure.  Little cute kids.  Still cute.  Okay.  And you look at her, you're like, oh, this doesn't seem like anything's wrong with her.  And they go, Mary, why don't you sing a song? 
[01:03:00]  You think the rendition of Ziggy doing Silent Night is beautiful?  This girl, like an angel.  And all the cancer kids joining in, right?  It was a cancer kid choir.  Yes, Mary.  Yeah.  So she's like in this voice from heaven.  And I'm really getting into it. 
[01:03:30]  I'm like, wow, that's kind of cool, you know?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, one of the helpers, the nurses, whatever, bends over to me and whispers in my ear.  It goes, you know, Mary's not going to see Christmas.  No.  Because it was April, all right?  What happened?  I was just talking to her.  She was just singing.  You're kidding.  Mary's not going to see Christmas.  So I look at it.  I think at this point, seriously, I turn white as a ghost.  Like, what the F are we doing here? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, they're there.  And now all the cancer kids are looking at Aunt and I like we're heroes because we brought  all these pies.  We brought a bunch of pies.  And we're like, we're not this nice.  We're not nice.  We're not doing this out of the kindness of our hearts.  We're using these kids.  We were thrown into the situation, did not know, and they think we're heroes.  And we're like, we are scumbags.  To use kids like this to try to save our necks, the station puts this goddamn thing together.  Now, we're still waiting for the photographer.  Right.  And then the nurses go. 
[01:04:30]  And I don't mean to laugh.  I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable because I don't want to be known as a dick for the story  because this is an insane story.  The nurses go, okay, why don't we get Billy?  So it's like, well, why isn't Billy here with the rest of the kids?  They get wheeled out or walk out or use the crutches and come out with the rest of the kids.  Why don't we get Billy?  It was sort of like, get the gimp, the gimp sleep. 
[01:05:00]  No, he was the only kid that wasn't there.  We're like, why isn't Billy there?  Suddenly, I hear a low hum down the hallway.  Here comes Billy's electric.  It wasn't even a wheelchair.  I don't know what this was.  It was a rolling platform.  It was like a wheelchair with just a head.  He was hooked up to tubes and wires and other devices to keep little Billy alive.  And the reason he didn't join the kids in the beginning, the cancer kids,  is because basically, you know, he only can muster up enough energy to maybe be awake for five minutes. 
[01:05:30]  He's like your cell phone's NICAD.  You know?  You don't want to keep it on all the time.  You just want to turn it on when you've got to use it or the battery will not.  Now they bring, yeah, they wheel little Billy in, Billy down the hall.  Now it's complete.  The smile on the kid's face, I'm like, holy.  At this point, we're like, so you've got to go through it.  Well, the photographers get there.  And me and Opie start having a conference.  We're like, this is the wrongest thing. 
[01:06:00]  We have never done anything so wrong.  Because on the radio, when you're talking, yeah, we say stuff that's really off the wall and wrong.  But then to just be directly involved in something like this,  they are using the dying children to take a photo op with us  to try to, in some way, spin it in the paper that we're good guys and should keep our job.  Right.  So we just turned around and said, no, this ain't it.  And we walked. 
[01:06:30]  Walked.  Took our pies, too.  Little kid thinking.  No, we left the pies.  And the kids didn't know we walked.  No, no, we were like, here you go, we're presenting these pies.  Yeah, and that was all fine and well.  But it was so depressing.  And then we were so friggin' pissed at them for putting us in this position.  At management and the PR firm, that we just went, you know something,  you guys do whatever you want.  We're not doing another thing. 
[01:07:00]  If we get fired, we get fired.  F it.  And they got mad at us because we walked.  We missed the little photo op to use the dying children to try to save our necks.  That's like just gunfire breaks out.  You pick up little Billy's head and try to block the shots.  That's what it was like.  Oh, my God.  What?  It was.  Little Billy's still alive, by the way.  He's on the phone.  Billy.  Ooh.  Ooh.  It was horrible.  It was.  And, of course, the story ends.  We did get fired. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And it was the best thing that ever happened.  And we took it.  Best thing that ever happened.  Boys, boys, I'll try to hire you back, boys.  Why didn't you take pictures with the cancer kids, boys?  Boys, why not take pictures with those little dying craps?  Proofy.  All right, cool.  Let's try to end on an up note.  Too late.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit. 
[01:08:00]  Opie and Anthony.  I don't care.  This is debauchery mania.  I don't care.  Prostate exams for everyone.  1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  ONA.  Yesterday, my sister was listening to C100.  And they were talking about putting a Z-Free Money Sticker on cars. 
[01:08:30]  Z-Free Money Sticker.  And then they're like, if you have a sticker that says WOW, take it off because it won't get you anything.  Oh, yeah.  Only boobs.  A WOW sticker will get you a lot more than a Z-Free sticker.  What losers?  Z-Free sticker.  A Z-Free Money Sticker.  You think any...  That is the stupidest thing.  Do you think anyone wins money on those stupid bumper stickers, radio station campaigns?  That's why we did WOW.  Yeah.  It's a no-brainer.  It's...  People give you something, boobs, just for putting a sticker on it. 
[01:09:00]  It doesn't have to be someone from the station driving around.  Let me explain something about radio.  Yeah.  Well, we'll take down the curtain again here, Anthony.  Yeah.  A station like Z-100, okay.  So they have these Z-Free Money Stickers.  Z-Free Money Sticker, everybody.  Get your sticker on.  We're going to be giving you cash.  So they're hoping to get maybe a couple thousand stickers out there.  Mm-hmm.  And they'll give prizes to maybe 10 to 20 people. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Tops.  Yeah.  I guarantee you, as we sit here on this fine Whip-A-Mount Wednesday, that hundreds upon hundreds of people are seeing stuff on the highways because of our WOW stickers.  Won't get you nothing.  They are so jealous of our WOW sticker campaign.  Have you seen how many cars come in and out of this city?  Have you seen the traffic?  Do you know the numbers of cars that are driving on this road?  What are the odds that you're going to stick a Z-100 sticker on your car and someone from that station is going to see it and what? 
[01:10:00]  Like pull you over and give you money?  Pull you over and give you Britney Spears tickets or something?  There's a better chance of getting pulled over with a gun to your head and someone taking your car in this city than there is of you getting money.  See, the WOW sticker's cool because the potential of every girl with boobs is the one that's giving you the prize.  Right.  It doesn't have to be someone that works here.  Instead of one prize van giving out money, we have thousands and thousands of women that are willing to flash guys that have WOW in their car. 
[01:10:30]  That's the beauty of it.  And the only reason I'm bringing it up on that stupid station is because they are very, very jealous of our bumper sticker campaign this fine season.  Because let's face it, wherever you go, you're seeing WOW.  You're seeing WOW.  Yeah.  That's it.  You don't have to bump into anybody except a woman with boobs.  They're giving away...  Just to put it in perspective, do you guys realize we ordered 150,000 brand new WOW stickers? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Guess how many we have?  How many?  Practically none.  Really?  We're going to have to reorder.  Practically none.  Well, I'm seeing them all over the place.  We're putting another rush order in to get more stickers because this is how hot this damn WOW thing is.  And I've seen a bunch of people with the homemade versions.  We love the homemade versions.  Yeah.  Still.  Still.  I'm very flattered when I see the homemade Wows on the car.  It's Whip Melt Wednesday. 
[01:11:30]  It's a beautiful day.  Get the WOW on your car.  So they can say whatever they want, but they're goddamn jealous of this radio station, our show, and our listeners that are just going nuts over this WOW thing.  Yeah.  Get that WOW off your car.  Get the Z100 sticker on there.  That'll get you something.  We're paying you to listen to us.  Z100.  Speaking of ridiculous other radio station stuff, do you see the new commercial with that small bone chick and Terry Garr? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  For Light FM, I guess it is.  I joke with Sandy about it all the time.  It is the lamest crap.  If you're a radio guy, that is the biggest embarrassment in the world.  Yeah.  See, Terry Garr is sitting there with that small bone, I guess her name is, and she says, here's how easy it is to play the music and not talk some kind of happy horse crap like that.  And small bone reaches over and pushes a button, doesn't say a word, and folds her arms. 
[01:12:30]  That's her monkey-ass job.  And shrugs.  And shrugs like, that's all I do.  That's all I do.  That's it.  So I guess she was getting pissed, and now there's an ad where she actually talks.  But she's like, and that was some, you know, crap, insert crap band here, on Light FM.  And Terry Garr and her stuff.  It just, I swear to God, when you see her and Terry Garr sitting in those seats, all you want to do is bust in the studio and spray them with banana juice.  I swear to God, I want to step on the console like a monkey in a cage and just spray them with banana juice. 
[01:13:00]  I'm over here now.  I know, Dice.  That's your line.  We know.  We know.  I could do the entire job with a dildo in my mouth.  Can I say that?  I'm over here now.  I know, Dice.  I'm Small...  What's her name?  I'm Valerie Smalldone.  I can do this entire job with a dildo in my mouth.  Because I don't have to talk.  I just have to press buttons.  Where's Terry Garr?  Terry Garr.  She was hot for ten minutes.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  What happened?  Well, she's old now.  I guess.  She's been around forever.  She only needs one hand.  I could diddle myself and seg songs with a dildo in my mouth.  All I need is one arm.  Our guest DJ today, Christopher Reeve.  And we don't even have to do anything different to the studio.  He's just got to roll up to the console.  All right, I'll do another visual impression for you.  I love your visuals.  Okay.  So do the people. 
[01:14:00]  That's good at the audio impressions, which is very important if you're doing a radio show.  I'm good at visuals, though.  Yeah.  All right, this is my impression of Christopher Reeve.  Christopher Reeve.  DJing the show.  Okay.  And he has to hit commercials.  Right.  Okay.  Wait, I need my seat lowered.  It's a visual bed, of course.  Yeah.  By the way, as we get ready for the visual impression, that's as low as it goes.  I need a...  Is there another seat?  Give me a sticky seat. 
[01:14:30]  Where's the short chair?  If you want to get one of these WOW stickers, self-addressed stamped envelope, WNEW, 10th floor,  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, attention WOW sticker.  I think that address is on the WNEW website.  All right, and my visual impression of Christopher Reeve, DJing, and let's say it's Light FM.  Okay.  All right.  Here he is.  Better to go into a Celine song from Spots.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  We need the Celine song. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  Where's the Celine song?  Because when the music ends, the jock has to do the clever seg that you don't even notice  at home.  They're pushing the button in between songs, and it's so smooth, so seamless.  Uh, you don't even notice.  That's how you're supposed to do it.  So, Opie will do Christopher Reeve as the stand-in DJ for Valerie Smoldone.  All right, here's Celine Dion ending and Christopher Reeve.  Ending.  Christopher Reeve.  At Light FM.  All right, Opie's wheeled up to the, uh, to the board about chest high. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  There's the song ending.  And, uh, eyes moving back and forth.  Looking troubled.  And dead air.  Is just sitting there not in the way.  That is just horrible, man.  So, I guess Christopher Reeve couldn't officially DJ later. 
[01:16:00]  Valerie Smoldone is better than Christopher Reeve.  Is what we're learning here, because if the song ended, he still wouldn't be able to do  anything.  So, you can push the button.  All right, here it is.  Now, look.  Oh, God, look at his eyes.  His eyes are looking very distressed, very troubled that he can't hit the button.  You're horrible, man.  Thank you.  Valerie Smoldone.  Thank you, Anthony.  I could, uh, diddle myself, have my hand on a big, giant, uh, piece of man meat, uh,  have a dildo firmly in place in my mouth, and still play the songs and get approval from 
[01:16:30]  Terry Garr.  Well, Ant, this is the first making fun of my...  You can wax my crotch.  This is the first making fun of other radio shows and other radio jocks, and they don't  belong to our company.  This is good.  God damn, we were going to burn them!  And before we end this break, if you ever see Anthony and I in dresses, advertising  for our show on TV, please drive up to the station and shoot us in the back of the head. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, God.  The, uh...  What is that?  Scott and Todd.  That is embarrassing.  In dresses.  How pathetic do you have to be that you're going to be dressed in drag on TV to promote  your stupid radio show?  It's not worth it.  It's not worth it.  Just strap on the friggin' appliances and go at each other's butts.  Oh.  With the dress and then the big punchline is that they were just, what, dreaming or something? 
[01:17:30]  Whatever.  What was that?  I don't even know how it goes.  And then one of them, Todd, is still wearing a dress.  You can pretend you're dreaming, but you're on TV wearing dresses.  Wearing dresses.  And I hear that's like a big commercial all over the United States in different markets.  Yeah, well...  Like the Slappy and Wappy show in Phoenix.  Well...  He does the same commercial.  Yeah, for all you PLJ fans out there, you know, if you are fans of their show, you're  like, oh, wow, man, they're so creative.  Look at their little, you know, TV commercial promoting their morning show.  Yeah.  No, see, that commercial's done all over the country. 
[01:18:00]  It's just different jocks and different, uh...  It's a formula commercial.  Different commercial.  Different dresses.  It tested very well in our research.  So we have it in all different markets.  We just can't do the same spot in overlapping markets.  God, and if Scott Shannon gets another facelift, he's going to have a, you know what, hanging  from his chin.  A shlong.  I got a shlong hanging from my chin.  There's a shlong.  Look at this.  I'm squeezing my sack on my neck.  I'm like a big rooster.  Why do you need so many facelifts if you're on radio? 
[01:18:30]  I look like foghorn leghorn with a scrotum on my chin.  Oh, brother.  All right, Dan, we have to take a break.  Yeah.  We have a nice surprise for everyone right now.  Mm-hmm.  As Whip Em Out Wednesday continues.  Uh, we got some clips from our road show from last Thursday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Uh, some of the highlights were some of the guys performing their most offensive songs at.  Yes.  Uh, a lot of video clips.  A lot of brand new video clips up on foundrymusic.com today.  Uh, Steve got the clip of Stephen Lynch doing FBA up there. 
[01:19:00]  It's hilarious.  With the additional, uh, verses.  Amazing.  Absolutely hilarious.  www.foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Okay?  Right.  But right now, here's our buddy, our pal.  He's a rock star.  Fuel.  Live from our road show in front of about 2,000 people singing a song you all know and love.  Mm-hmm.  Baby Raper.  The other red make think I'm kind of sick. 
[01:19:30]  Because of where I like to dip my stick.  And how I always talk about today.  I met that little hottie, John Bonnet, whose parents did kill her, by the way.  I wish that they could somehow understand. 
[01:20:00]  This is hard.  I'm just an average, ordinary man.  But somehow they just can't seem to get.  Why Maggie Simpson always makes me wet.  Here it comes.  I'm a baby raper.  I'm a baby raper. 
[01:20:30]  The food and the young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby raper.  I'm a baby raper.  I'm a baby raper.  I'm a baby raper.  The young is cherry.  I always taste so sweet.  Oh my God.  Oh, my God.  Because they come back to keep me strong. 
[01:21:00]  When mommy turns away, I go for more.  Sing them songs, tell them that they're sweet.  As I whip the little booties off their feet.  Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper. 
[01:21:30]  So sweet and young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper.  The youngest cherry, I always taste so sweet.  Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper.  The youngest cherry, I always taste so sweet. 
[01:22:00]  Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper.  The youngest cherry, I always taste so sweet.  Let's hear it for fuel!  You're a sick-ass, y'all.  Look at that, Opie. 
[01:22:30]  We continue to be an award-winning show.  Who does the voting, because are they on heroin?  Cool!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's beyond comedy, it's beyond fiction.  It's fabulous.  It's fabulous.  It's beyond the world.  1027.  WMSW.  Hey, Gorilla Boy's on the line.  Jeff Norris, what's going on?  Jeff.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Hello.  He gave up on us and hung up?  Did you hang up?  Jeff? 
[01:23:00]  Gorilla Boy?  Alright.  I think he got arrested or something.  Is Paul Mercurio here?  Yeah.  Brink him in.  Gorilla Boy.  boy. Hi, guys. Oh, great white gorilla. Don't destroy our village. Hey, Anthony, let me  ask you something. Are martial art tattoos considered a prop? No. No? Not with you. If  not, I'll get skin grafting. Now I'm a prop comic. Somebody kicking someone's ass is a  prop. Hey, Jeff. Maybe you can do that. That's a good one. Jeff, just in case you weren't  listening earlier, Anthony called you a hack. I did not. Really? I try to bring the character 
[01:23:30]  to life. I'll leave the Archie at home. What do you want me to tell you? Hi. Hi. Now,  what happened? First of all, I just want to tell you guys that I am forever in debt to  you guys because if it wasn't for you, I would be. No, listen. And the Port Authority cops,  if you're listening, thank you. You guys were very nice. I was on law and order. I said  a law and order yesterday. Yeah. I'm driving home. This little, you got the dump button 
[01:24:00]  ready? No, don't care. These two white trash punks cut in front of my truck. Don't realize  there's another car in front of me. Jam on a brake, so naturally I do. All my stuff goes  forward and the fake 9mm lands on my dashboard. Now, what are you doing with a fake 9mm in  your car? I told you. I was a cop on the set of law and order. Yeah, but usually they don't  let you take the props home with you. No, no. It's my own. I bought a cop uniform and the  whole stuff. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's a lot going on here. You get a part 
[01:24:30]  on a TV show, but you have to buy your wardrobe and your product. No, what I did was I went  out and I bought it through an acting school and took headshots in it and submitted it to  these different cop shows because I always said people told me I could get a cop role.  So anyway, here I'm thinking it's a lucky break and this kid cuts me off and everything goes flying  and the gun and the nightstick and everything lands on my desk. But wait, wait, wait. We've got to 
[01:25:00]  slow you down again now. Why would you have the prop gun? I mean, why would they allow you to bring  your own prop gun to the set of law and order? Don't they have that just laying around? Well,  they do have stuff, but I had my own, you know, I had my own stuff. And since you were taking the  pictures for this so you could submit them to the shows, why would you have to then take this stuff  with you? They like you. In other words, I guess it enhances your chances of getting on or getting 
[01:25:30]  lines or what have you because you're, I guess it's like a prepared, like you go to school with a pencil.  Schools have a pencil, but you bring your own. Yes. All right. Okay. So everything goes flying  forward. Right. So with this, me with my psycho temper, I yell at the kid. The kid throws a...  Can I back up again? Oh, Jesus Christ. Go ahead. Jeff, are you feeling left out? Haven't been on the  show in a while and need to come up with a good story for our show? No, not at all. Just checking.  Not at all. All right. The story just seems a little fishy. All right. Go ahead. Now that I feel like a 
[01:26:00]  total a-hole. I want to hear the rest of it. Now we need to hear the rest of the story. Holy Christ. You know,  I have a lot of friends, but I think the one thing I question is you.  Oh, frosted mini-wheat. Don't destroy our village. Frosted mini-wheat. Now, anyway,  to make a long story short, they thought it was a real gun. They freaked out. They pulled  their guns on me. They found out who I was. Everything was cool. And port-a-tardy cops are 
[01:26:30]  good people. So, because the cops came and then they look in the car. They treated me like  Rodney King. I got cops. I just felt like an idiot. And I called them. I was just, you know,  I said, I'm an act. I swear to Christ. Gun partner. The one cop knew me from the show  and he said he's a big fan and they were really good guys. And I wanted to thank them. They're  good people. And I don't feel left out from the show. Gun partner. Oh, Jeff, I was just  kidding. You know. I know. I'm only teasing. I'm only teasing. And I'm not plugging nothing, 
[01:27:00]  so don't worry about it. I think your legs come back. See? See, Jeff, you have the problem.  Next time someone goes to kick your foot at cow lines, I'm going to walk away.  I wanted to see the guy get beat up. See, Jeff, you're abusing me. I didn't push that button.  I meant to push the foghorn leghorn. And what would he say? I see your legs come back.  Okay. Thanks, guys. What the hell were you thinking? 
[01:27:30]  And you got another button you want to push over there? When you're telling these little  stories, that's a good idea. Have a point. It makes it so much more interesting for the  listener. That wasn't me. That was open. Oh, okay. Whatever. Yeah, we'll play that game.  Please don't hurt me, old big white gorilla. I love when he does that. Oh, man. You know  what? Someone is defending you, though. So why don't we talk to you? Yeah, I'm sure this is  sincere, too. No, I think it is. Matthew, I think. What's up? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I just 
[01:28:00]  want to, you know, help him clear it up a little bit. A lot of it. I do extra work  myself. And what happens is a lot of these extra actors, you know, if you have your own  props, your own wardrobe, it makes it easy for you to get roles. You can bring your own  stuff. It'll give you actually more money to bring your own wardrobe and stuff like that  in. So I see a lot of these guys on Law & Order, you know, they bring in their own  props. Right.  All right, Matthew. Thank you. Thank you. 
[01:28:30]  Good morning. Jeff, that guy, you know, defended you. I know.  So you have audio of the cops when they rolled up to Norris' vehicle.  It's coming right for us!  Melanie, what's going on? How is it possible that when you're driving, you stop short, stuff  lands on top of your dashboard? Because I was doing 40 and I had a jam on the brake.  Where was this prop gun? How does it jump up and land on your dashboard? That's a good  question. I had a garment bag over my passenger seat and everything flew forward. Flew forward 
[01:29:00]  and up? On top of the dashboard? I've got a big truck, sweetheart. I'm going back to my  physics. Yeah, but I drive an SUV, too, and I don't see how stuff can fall on top of my...  I'm going back to my physics class. Things can jump up and forward at the same time. Sure.  Yeah. Maybe you hit a bump. It's like the Kennedy assassination. It would, yeah. It's the magic  gone nightstick theory. We're forward and to the right. It's like impossible. No, it's  not impossible. Well, I mean, the chances of that happening... Melanie? Wait, wait, wait, 
[01:29:30]  wait. Let me talk to Melanie. Melanie? Yes? Have you ever seen Gorilla Boy? No. Just say,  okay, okay, I believe you, Gorilla Boy. No, but I don't. If I have stuff in my passenger seat  and I stop short, everything comes on the floor. Nothing has ever flown up and landed on the  dashboard. Yeah, but, sweetheart, your dirtball in the front seat wouldn't land on the dashboard.  Oh, ho, ho, ho. You're lying because it's impossible. You're lying. You're the inspiration for 
[01:30:00]  a twin bed, you dirty whore. Thank you. Hi, Melanie. Oh, my God. Perfect guy to play a cop. Right.  Paul Mercurio in the studio, Jeff. Yeah. Say hi to Paul. Hey, Jeff. Hi, Paul. How you doing, man?  Hold on. Let me get rid of Melanie here. He doesn't... This is turning out to be a really  good segment. I like this. I'm trying to figure it out myself. Another actor on the phone, Jeff.  Another Jeff. Jeff. Yeah. What's up, man? Not much. I'm on my way to an audition now,  and I got three dead whores in the trunks. But it's okay. Nice. I'm playing a psycho. Yeah, 
[01:30:30]  it's okay, though, because you're trying out for a part. Yeah, we're having a trunk,  but it's good. Dude, I mean, the cops stopped me before me. No big deal. All right. Thanks a lot,  man. Hey, Gorilla Boy? Yes, sir. For the record, I believe you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know.  Come on. Aw. I know. When are you going to be on Law and Order? I think, I don't know. I shot it yesterday.  I'm on it today. I guess it airs. I guess it takes, like, three weeks. Yeah. It's Special 
[01:31:00]  Victims Unit. I don't know when. I think there's no major big thing. It's just... Yeah, that's  all out. You're a mini-week, goddammit. Yeah, that's right. I'm the first at mini-week. He's  more than that, too. He gets tackled in that Stack of Two commercial. I saw that one, too.  I was running during the XFL stuff. Well, if I can't, I did get a part in a movie, so that's  one thing I will say. What movie? I'm in a movie that starts shooting next week called...  Fantasia? Huh? Nothing. It's called I'm With Lucy. It stars Monica Potter.  Who's that? Why don't I even tell you guys this? Hey, no. He's in that movie with Morgan 
[01:31:30]  Freeman, Along Came a Spider. Oh, yeah. Why are you getting mad and saying, why do I tell  you this? You know what, let me tell you something. Now I'm going to frigging talk. First of all,  okay, you got every other comic on there, and they're all great. I'm not saying that. Hey,  Jeff, don't do a Billy and Paul on us here. I'm never going to do that. I'm your friend,  but I'm saying, how come you allow every other guy to call and plug and come in and say anything, 
[01:32:00]  and I call, and it's like, bye, bye, get the coffee. You know what, boy? You just plugged  for 20 minutes. That's good stuff. I didn't plug. I was telling you a life-threatening story  where I fat myself. And we're entertaining the people. The phones are going crazy. Look,  Sarah wants to say hi to you. Hold on. Oh, Christ. You ought to put the good talk  call through. Of course. Look, Sarah, what's up? Hey, guys. Did he also have to get stitches  on the side of his head because a motorcycle went into his car? Oh, my car. Okay, look. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah. Remember our old intern? No. Jeff, look, I didn't know she was going to say that.  That's all right. That's all right. Vinnie from Rosedale saying, hey, Norris,  when Santa and the Easter Bunny come over, tell him I said hi. That's not me, though.  No, that's cool. I still believe in that. That's cool. All right. Hold on. I agree  with Gorilla Boy. I'm an extra in porno movies, and they recommend you bring your own junk.  Nice. That's pretty good, man. Hold on. Pete's found a hole in your story. One? Pete, what's up? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, Pete. Hey, what's up, guys? How you doing? Hey, listen. First of all, this guy's a clown.  He's got an SUV, right? No. He's got one of these monster trucks, basically.  All right. Check this out now. He says that the bag was sitting on top of the passenger seat,  right? Mm-hmm. Right. That's still way below the dashboard, guys.  No, it's not. I mean, it's got to climb up.  Inside of a Dodge Ram, you come up. Yeah, time up, tough guy.  You're a big goofball, man. Let me tell you something. 
[01:33:30]  I drive an SUV. Wow. Let me tell you something.  I drive an SUV myself. I'm in one right now, and I'm telling you.  I got a double bag. Thank you.  All right. You win. You win.  You talk like that from swallowing ****.  No, no.  Your mother had me up my life, bro.  I deliver pizzas for Domino's. I have no life, so I have to go on O.P.  and Anthony. It's off the night.  No, but you got a life. You auditioning with a cop suit in your car to get a role on Law & Order, but you got a life. 
[01:34:00]  That's right, my friend. Let me tell you.  I might be a friend for a little, bro. You don't know me. You're up in a corner.  All right. Go back to your home, bro.  All right.  What I'm going to say is that if you've got a duffel bag on the seat, let me tell you.  Hold on. You can't bull talk.  It's Jeff's brother, everybody.  Yeah.  Is he done? Can I speak for a second?  Yeah, go ahead, Pete. First of all.  Okay. What I'm saying is that if a duffel bag's on the passenger seat, it's still way below the dashboard.  If he stops short, unless there's a midget in his duffel bag pushing it up, it's not coming up that far.  What are you, come on, bro? 
[01:34:30]  Come on, bro. Come on.  You're not here.  Last Tuesday, I hate to bother you.  I can't believe that you're questioning this.  I've seen this happen before.  There was an episode where Martin Landau was driving, and I believe he hit somebody, and a gun flew up and fired and hit a guest arm over the Amsterdam.  It could happen.  It killed your dog, Lieutenant, didn't it?  It killed my dog and Mrs. Colombo. 
[01:35:00]  All right, Morris, I'm willing to believe your story.  There's just a few holes. Pardon me. Can I ask you one more question?  I understand gravity and physics, so what dimension was this, sir?  You were dressed in a cop's uniform.  Correct.  So you're in a police officer's uniform.  No, I wasn't in a uniform.  That's true.  Yes, you were.  I actually have the Dodge website up. 
[01:35:30]  I am looking at the interior of the Dodge Ram to see how high.  Instead of calling you guys, you really think I would learn.  It actually has an asterisk.  It says, do not put 9mm fake gun on passenger seat on the bag when going to be extra at the line order.  That's a tendency to jump up onto the dashboard.  It goes up and to the right.  It's all there.  It's small print.  Got to read it.  There you go. 
[01:36:00]  I'm looking.  Wow.  Jeff, you didn't have a tryout in the new Matrix movie, did you?  No.  The Matrix.  All right.  I'm looking.  Oh, what do you think?  If something is on the seat, do you think it can go up?  Anthony, you know how big a seat is in a truck?  I'm looking at the seat of your seat.  Where your head sits.  Yes.  Okay.  That's where it was drooped.  It was drooped over the top of the seat.  Oh, oh, oh.  So it was over the back of the seat. 
[01:36:30]  How do you balance a gun on the back of the seat?  Yeah.  No, the bag.  It was in the bag.  It's still how to get out of the bag, though.  Yeah, how to get out of the bag.  It has hands and hands.  It was in a garment bag.  It's the David Blaine of guns.  It's out of the bag.  That trick's going to be on ABC next week, as a matter of fact, right?  I am going to stand in a block of ice.  And a gun will fly out of my...  And then there will be a tornado of fire.  And I will deny my sexuality yet again. 
[01:37:00]  Who am I?  David Cufferfield.  I like that they put grease on his eyebrows so they wouldn't singe.  There's like 30-gallon drums of grease on his eyebrows.  I'm sorry.  I'm getting you off on your...  That's okay.  Gorilla Boy.  Yes, sir.  You know we kid because we love.  Oh, then you guys must be madly in love with me.  Nick must fantasize about me at night, then.  Come on.  If you kid for love, then I've got to be the most loved guy.  Come on.  This is too good.  We couldn't pick on Earl today.  We had to find somebody. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, he took a beating the other day.  All right, fellas.  I've got to get out of here.  You've got any...  Keep talking to you.  Do you have any gigs, Norris?  Am I allowed?  Sure.  After that beating, of course.  Next Thursday and Friday night at Caroline's with Jim Brewer.  Hey, cool.  Yeah, and I was looking forward to working with Jay, but there was too many comics, so  I got the bump.  But I'll be on the show next Thursday and Friday with Brewer at Caroline's.  Hey, come on in and say hi to us next week, all right?  Will do.  Thanks, fellas.  You're the best.  All right, Joe.  Bye, man.  Seth Norris, Gorilla Boy. 
[01:38:00]  It was like that episode with William Shatner as the magician.  Remember that one?  All of a sudden, guns are flying out of garment bags and whatnot, landing on a dashboard.  It was just like that episode.  Let me get this right.  At the time of the shooting, you were having dinner with the gun.  Is that correct?  So it's on the back of your seat in a garment bag.  Suddenly, the brakes are applied, and it flies right through the placement.  The gun stops.  It has a sip of coffee on the way to the dashboard. 
[01:38:30]  I hear the gun was chipping golf balls the whole time.  Now, your neighbor says you like to take walks on the beach with your gun.  Is that correct?  It's a prompt gun.  I hear for years, Bill Shatner walked around with a phaser.  He had to have his own phaser with him during the Star Trek series.  Now, let me listen to Captain Kirk.  The phaser flew out of your ass.  Hit Mr. Sulu in the head.  He continued toward the viewing screen. 
[01:39:00]  You know those big gloves during the games for the Triskelion?  William Shatner supplied those.  They were actually candy dishes from his own house, I do believe.  And the spaghetti conland, the monster from Lost in Space.  That's a long part of the cast.  That was young William.  Spaghetti conland.  What a bliss, by God.  We have to take a break.  Paul Mercurio in the studio.  And Di Nicola.  And Mike Di Nicola.  Hey, everybody.  Mike Di Nicola.  He's in the bad seat, though.  I can't see it.  Yeah, I know.  The bad seat. 
[01:39:30]  He's behind that big, huge computer screen.  Watch out for flying fire launch.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The O&O show beats the hell out of my dad's little pornos.  1027 WNEW is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special Ron and Fez. 
[01:40:00]  Fez learns a horrible secret.  Fez, it's time you knew the truth.  You're adopted.  What?  You don't belong to us.  Fez, we got you from another show.  Robbie, you don't mean...  Yes, it's true, Fez.  You're really a sports guy.  Yeah!  On the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez, mid-days, noon to three.  We've got to play this tune because the least singer's on the phone, Anthony. 
[01:40:30]  How are we?  Garly Goss.  Yeah.  He's the singer of this little ditty.  Check your sound.  He's the singer of this little ditty.  Living easy, living free.  He's the city, I don't know where to ride.  Asking up there, leave me be.  Everything's playing in my stride.  Don't need reason, don't need rhyme. 
[01:41:00]  There ain't nothing that I'd rather do.  Going down, party time.  Here, my friends, you're a baby.  There ain't nothing that I'd rather do.  There ain't nothing that I'd rather do.  I'm on the highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  No stop sign in your speed limit.  Nobody gonna slow me down. 
[01:41:30]  Like a wheelie.  I'm on the speedy.  Nobody gonna hit me around.  Can't fake it.  Get my feet.  Yeah, I'm just a bad man.  Hey, mama.  Look at me.  I'm on my way to the side of this race.  Here, my friends.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell. 
[01:42:00]  Highway to hell.  Don't stop me.  I'm on my way to hell. 
[01:42:30]  I'm on my way.  Highway to hell.  Highway to hell.  Tell me there's a box set of this.  What, boss?  Tell me there's a box set of this.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  A whole CD.  That's Casey Dixie.  And I'm going there.  I'm going there.  I'm on the highway to hell. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, Casey Dixie.  Casey Dixie.  Casey Dixie, yeah.  Casey Dixie.  You've got to say that's a little.  A hillbilly tribute to ACDC, Anthony.  And Barley Scotch is on the phone.  Yeah, he's the lead singer of the band, I believe.  Hey, Barley.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, we've been having some fun playing these tunes the last couple days.  Right on.  We had some fun playing ourselves here a while back.  Well, where the hell are you from?  Man, up on Tennessee, North Carolina line. 
[01:43:30]  Old place called Derely Collar.  Oh, my God.  Like deer in the animal, not like deer like your woman.  Really?  Man.  Derely Collar.  Hey, did you do some radio down there, too?  Oh, it's way on off in Knoxville.  We can't hardly pick it up much.  Will you stand out a window and just yell to the neighborhood?  Pretty much, yeah.  Well, it's called a holler.  Got a holler.  Well, the album's getting a lot of attention there, Barley. 
[01:44:00]  It appears to be, man.  I've been able to phone people all day long.  Really?  Now, who's your band?  Well, if you look at the record there, or CD, I reckon they call it now.  I reckon.  I'm the fella there holding the fiddle.  Who's that big old boy?  Well, that big old boy's Cletus Williamson.  He's my cousin.  He's playing bass.  Cletus?  Cletus.  Cletus Williams.  Cletus looks like a...  He changed his name from Jethro.  Who's Cletus?  He wanted to go more showbiz. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, Cletus proud of his beard there, too.  Cletus looks like the guy that would do that rape scene from...  What the hell movie was that?  I was...  The Burroughs.  Hello.  Deliverance.  Deliverance.  Oh, that's a mighty fine piece of film right there.  That is fine.  Now, so you're a band in all the music and everything, because you're talented.  Well, thank you.  Hell, we've been picking together since we were kids.  We've grown up together.  You've grown up together.  Why ain't there none of them colored folk in your band? 
[01:45:00]  Well, there just didn't happen to be no colored folk that we've grown up with.  No?  We've got none of his colored folk.  Because of that electric sense you put up with.  Goddamn.  I love it.  We've got none of them on the radio.  That's great.  That's two.  Get away with that.  Oh, hell.  We do everything.  A little bit of everything.  Right on.  Brian on the fence. 
[01:45:30]  They saw the noose and moved on.  Those people there at the doggone media school that have been talking to me all day yesterday,  they done told me wrong.  They said, don't curse at all.  Yeah, don't curse at all.  We ain't cussed.  Well, all right.  Wow.  Hey, man, I'm here for you.  So what other bands are you guys into besides ACDC?  Oh, you know, Bill Monroe, Stanley Brothers, Clinch Mountain Boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We pretty much just showed up playing a lot of traditional bluegrass.  We hadn't heard no ACDC until right before we got together to make this record. 
[01:46:00]  You memorized my record collection.  Wow.  Really?  So now you didn't even hear ACDC.  No, man.  We've since come to find out they're a pretty famous band.  Why did you pick them over another band that maybe you hadn't heard?  Well, it was a complete fluke, man.  I mean, Ditterly Color is way off the beaten path, and it ain't really on the way to anything.  So we don't get a lot of outside people through there, really.  You know, it's not the kind of place that you just pass through, because it ain't on the way to nothing.  But anyways, man, I mean, the way we got into the same record, one day we was all sitting 
[01:46:30]  around picking a little and drinking a little, you know, of our corn liquor that we make up  there we're pretty proud of.  Corn liquor.  This train had to come hauling ass through town real fast, wrapped his car around this  old tree down the devil's elbow.  If you don't know what the devil's elbow is, it's a mighty big curve.  I wouldn't expect so.  Well, unfortunately, the poor old boy didn't make it.  I mean, he was all tore up.  He shot a Dukes of Hazzard scene there, didn't he?  Yeah, but we were sifting through the records trying to find some way to identify him so 
[01:47:00]  we could let his people know what had happened.  And in the backseat, we pulled out these ACDC albums.  So we took them back, put them on a big trail and gave them a stand.  That's where I fell right in love with him.  Well, that's an uplifting story.  We found a dead guy and all this stuff.  Well, we never did find his people, so if anybody listening happens to, you know, had lost  somebody else.  We left the guy to the pigs.  No, we put him in the old refrigerator on the porch, plugged back in. 
[01:47:30]  He's in there chilled.  We need to return the body now.  Maybe he drove in from Mount Pilot.  Well, I reckon that's possible.  That's about an hour over in North Carolina.  There you go, Mount Pilot.  It's there, man.  What do you guys do down there when you're not picking away?  Well, we, you know, we experiment with hydroponic gardening and do a lot of alternative fuel  and beverage resource kind of manufacturing.  Really?  Yes, sir.  You grow any marijuana? 
[01:48:00]  Well, no, I can't talk too much about exactly what it is.  I mean, we're out on the radio here, right?  Right.  I don't think I ought to say too much.  Do you guys tour around the country?  Oh, no, sir.  We never have done that.  Yeah, we just play around the church socials and such around Deerlick.  Church socials and Deerlick.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know, like that song you just played there, that whole way to hell.  Now, that's a parable, man.  That's a fable.  Yeah, all right.  That's the same theme as a lot of the old bluegrass we grew up picking,  just, I mean, kind of from a different point of view now, but...  Did you play that for Easter? 
[01:48:30]  Well, you know, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  How many people are in Deerlick?  Oh, about 150, 160.  That's it?  It varies a little bit sometimes.  Well, we should ask him about the Jeff Norris gun thing.  Oh, what happened to him?  You ever have a gun in the passenger seat when you're driving?  Well, usually I put it under my seat.  Yeah.  Well, you're smart, but...  All right, whatever.  Well, I plan us to have one in the passenger seat.  What might happen?  Well, a guy claimed that he had a prop gun in his passenger seat. 
[01:49:00]  He stopped short, and the prop gun ended up on the dashboard.  Now, is that possible?  Uh, not unless the car flipped over, I don't reckon.  In some of the races, there's gravity.  It should take that gun more toward the floorboard.  I believe 9.8 meters per second per second.  Oh, by the way, he's an associate professor of physics at Harvard.  That's pretty good.  Farley's pretty funny.  What's your stand on...  Well, that's the course not taking into account wind resistance. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  Now, what's your, uh, what's your stand on the Confederate flag?  Well, I don't really think much about it one way or the other, really.  Well, that Mississippi, they decided to keep it.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I heard about that, and when they said they was going to have to take it off,  it just didn't make any sense to me.  I thought, what are they going to do?  Stand a boy around with a carpet knife to cut it out of every flag?  And then wouldn't that flag look pretty stupid with a big hole cut out of the corner of it?  You make a lot of sense.  I just try to be practical.  My daddy raised me like that. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Hey, what do the women look like down there?  Oh, well, you know, I, you know, some of them's pretty fine.  Some of them, they get a little heavy.  The ones that keep their teeth good, we like that.  Well, I would think with a limited amount of people and, uh, deer holler, deer lick holler,  deer loom, that, uh, you wouldn't have many girls to choose from.  Well, you don't, you know, but it's kind of like writing a sonnet.  I mean, you got 14 lines, you got to rhyme it in a certain way.  I mean, you know, staying with a pattern can create beauty sometimes. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you saying there's a little bit of insects going on?  Oh, now, we know, in the eyes of the Lord, I reckon we're all related to some degree or another.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  Really busting a butt, those stereotypes.  What about having sex with the pigs and the sheep and stuff?  Yeah, any beef beyond?  I personally don't have any experience with that now.  Is that because you've been turned down by the sheep sort of thing?  Well, what have you heard, then, if you haven't had the experience?  Well, I haven't heard much.  I've just, you know, seen movies made in places like New York City that mention it, 
[01:51:00]  but I don't know anybody that actually does it.  Are you married?  Oh, I'm on the radio, right?  Yeah.  Oh, sure, I ain't married.  Okay.  Yeah, you got the girls all worked up in their cars here in New York.  Hey.  You got an email address?  They'll send you off a little email.  Yeah, all right.  I'm thinking Stinky Road Trip.  Oof.  And a deer lick holler.  Did we dare send Stinky to deer lick?  Good Lord, I don't think he'd come back.  And our own black girl.  We have a black guy that works with us here, a black girl. 
[01:51:30]  And would he be welcome in a deer lick holler?  Well, I'm sure.  Yeah?  He's constantly having sex with a white woman now.  Constantly.  Oh, now you're trying to drag me into political race issues.  Race issues.  Race issues.  There's no comment on no racial issues.  Very good.  That's the right answer.  He's a diplomat.  He's very diplomatic. 
[01:52:00]  Well, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Farley, you're a lot of fun.  Hey, thanks, man.  That's what I'm here for.  I want to be loved.  Have you been up to New York at all?  No, sir.  I never have.  You ever been out of deer lick holler?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been down the road to Knoxville many times, over to Asheville, down to Boone.  Boone.  Down to Boone.  You guys got some of that technology down there?  What kind of technology?  Like the computers and stuff.  Well, you know our manager, Max Percentage, the reason why he'd become our manager is he was  the only fellow that had a GED and a computer. 
[01:52:30]  So he's pretty computer literate now.  GED and a computer.  It was between him and Joe, who had a toaster and Max Percentage.  And a flashlight.  Did you catch the name of his manager, Max Percentage?  Yeah.  We had one.  And his name was Owen Money.  There you go.  Are you guys into the George W. down there?  The George W.  You like George W., the president?  Well, you know, I think I would have had a lot more fun if I could have had with the  fellow you all had up there before.  Oh, big.  He seemed like he knew where the ladies was at. 
[01:53:00]  And this one you got in there right now don't seem like he's even interested in women.  You're making it sound like you're from another country and you don't like our president.  He's yours, too.  Right.  Oh, I don't have nothing to get him.  I don't even know the man.  He just doesn't seem like he'd be nowhere near as much fun as that old Clinton family.  No, Bill Clinton was fun.  I mean, I never read stuff about him.  I thought, I want to party with this guy.  Old George, he just seems straight-laced.  I don't know if I'd have any fun with him.  Yeah.  You into the militias or anything like that?  No, no. 
[01:53:30]  I don't know nothing about no militia.  You know, deer with muzzles.  But, you know, no.  You into the militias?  No, no.  It's hard to get one started here in Manhattan.  We got plenty of people.  What's the problem?  Yeah.  Really solid rock, this island.  They frown upon that in Manhattan.  Huh.  Well, you just have to go underground, man.  They're keeping us down.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, could you say well-doggy?  Say what?  Well-doggy.  Well-doggy?  Yeah, like people say that down there?  No, I don't think I've ever heard anybody say that.  When you get excited about something, it's got to be clean. 
[01:54:00]  And what's an expression that's local to your town that, like, we would never hear?  Give us one.  Like, when you're not, you know, like, you think, oh, my God.  Like, we say, oh, my God.  What would you say?  Oh, land sakes.  For land sakes.  Land sakes.  Sakes alive.  Yep.  Hey, Barley.  Yeah.  Jeff Foxworthy, funny?  No.  Yeah.  All right.  We could hang with you.  That old boy, way too clean cut.  He ain't a genuine article.  Do you like Gallagher?  I don't believe I've ever seen me, no Gallagher. 
[01:54:30]  He's the guy that busts apart the big watermelon with the hammer at the end of his act.  The fruit has no chance.  Never seen the old boy.  Just sitting there.  He can't roll.  He's like kind of a weight show, man.  He can make good wine out of watermelon.  You can see that watermelon's trying to roll off, too.  He just can't roll off.  Holy s**t, here comes the mouth.  Thank God we got one of them delays.  Yeah, we had a stump out there.  All right, Barley.  Sure.  All right, Barley. 
[01:55:00]  We'll be letting you go.  You say hi to everyone down there, and we'll be playing your record.  Man, we sure do appreciate you playing that record.  You want to give out any plugs or anything?  I just said their label here tells me it's in every Walmart in the country today.  You got Walmarts in New York?  No, I don't know.  Not around these parts.  Well, I don't know.  They tell me it's in every record store in the country.  I have not gone and personally inspected all of them yet,  but I aim to try here once they get me hooked up with a car.  How did you get discovered that you've got like a national thing out there? 
[01:55:30]  How did you get discovered like that?  Well, I mean, our manager, he, I guess, got on that Internet  and hooked up with some people down there in Nashville.  That Internet.  And next thing I know, we're down in Nashville cutting this album that you've got up there right now.  That's great, man.  Congratulations.  Hey, well, thank you.  All right, we're going to plug your album, and you go plug your sister.  Hey, we appreciate it.  All right, Barley.  All right, see you.  Bye-bye.  We have found a new friend of the show right there.  There you go.  Barley Scotch.  We've got to play a little piece of another one now. 
[01:56:00]  Max percentage.  All right, this is Hayseed Dixie, a hillbilly tribute to ACDC.  I guess it's in a lot of record stores right now.  Rob.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Huh?  Road trip to Derry.  I mean, deer lick.  Yeah, we're thinking about it.  Well, deer lick.  We'll see if we can...  Deer lick!  All right.  As we go to break, Paul Mercurio in the studio.  Another one from Hayseed Dixie, a hillbilly tribute to ACDC.  It's in record stores. 
[01:56:30]  She was the best machine.  She kept me motor clean.  She was the best damn woman that I ever seen.  She had the sight to the side.  Telling me no lies.  She outed me out with them American guys.  Taking more than a share.  Had me back for air. 
[01:57:00]  She told me to come, but I was already there.  If the walls were to shake you, the earth was a question from mine.  We're seeing you.  We were some men to be here.  Give me all night long.  Give me the kitchen and you get home.  Give me all night long.  Working double time on my production line. 
[01:57:30]  She's one of the kinds of just mine, oh, mine.  Want no applause, just a matter of time.  Made a meal out of me.  Come back for more.  Had to tool me down.  Take a look at the ground.  Now I'm back in the ring.  The kitchen, just a swing.  Yeah, the wall was a chicken.  Earth was quick and my mind was red.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:58:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:58:30]  Marilyn Manson.  Disposable team.  Look who's in the studio, Wendy from the 55-Gallon Jump Challenge.  Yes.  She's also been in the Feels for Meals box a few times, Anthony.  Yes.  Today was supposed to be the big day of our huge promotion, Feels for Meals, but, uh, well,  I think you know the story by now.  That old gag didn't pan out.  I'm going to come support you guys.  Bunch of pussies around here that don't know how to make things happen. 
[01:59:00]  Just want to find, uh, ways, uh, why we shouldn't do things.  Excuses and scapegoats.  That's what we have.  So, uh, Wendy's going to get into the, uh, Feels for Meals box because we got a couple  guys from Penthouse taking photographs for their website, Anthony.  Nice.  Because, uh, next Tuesday, our Penthouse interview comes out.  Yes.  Uh, a lot of people, uh, looking forward to that.  We're looking forward to that.  And, and, all right, Wendy, get in the goddamn box.  Oh.  All right.  They never take their top off before they go in the box. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, I noticed that.  I know.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  What?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  Who's the brother?  Hold on.  Let's step on the brake pedal real quick.  I can't check out your sister if you're in here.  I'm not looking.  I'm not going to look.  Dude, you're her brother.  Yes.  And she is blood brother?  Yes.  Topless.  Dude, you got to, like, feel her in the box.  No, man.  You wouldn't feel your, uh, sister's boobies?  Why not?  No.  Rick, break out the prize list.  What do we got? 
[02:00:00]  Dude, what would you do?  What would it take?  What would it take to get your own sister?  To feel up your sister.  50 bucks?  Rick, Ben, what do we have?  We've got a Darth Vader coffee mug.  You want 50 bucks to touch your sister's boobies?  See you idiots from yesterday, uh, abusing us because we're talking about prizes and you're  like, hey, you guys don't need prizes.  You guys just continue making us laugh.  Who cares about prizes?  This is why we need prizes.  If we had something cool, this guy would be feeling up his own sister.  Yeah.  But instead, we've got a coffee mug to offer him. 
[02:00:30]  What would it take?  Brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  Oh!  We can absolutely get you brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  For Irving Plaza, December 9th.  We're all going.  Brewer tickets.  I'm so telling Dad.  That's all right.  Uh, Wendy, what do you need?  She's, she's, she's cute and stuff.  Even though she's your sister.  Have you ever seen your sister naked?  No.  No?  No.  Wendy?  Do you think she's cute?  Oh, she's my sister.  What do you need for this to happen? 
[02:01:00]  Uh, what?  No.  Brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets?  Dude, we'll give you brewer tickets if you reach in the box and just cop a feel off your  sister.  It's one of the hottest tickets in town.  Oh, my.  Jeff, are you kidding me?  Go meet him.  Why not?  Why not?  Uh, meet?  Meet and greet?  Yeah, we will get you, we'll get, believe me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Before I answer.  Before I answer.  Don't go to the next level on us.  I know what you guys do here.  Nah, nah.  This is where it ends. 
[02:01:30]  You get the tickets and the meet and greet backstage, yes.  But that's it.  Don't say, you know, whatever.  Tickets, meet and greet.  You put your hands in.  But now somebody's got to confirm because he could just put his hands in.  Can I put my shirt on?  No.  What?  No.  My brother.  Yeah, but that's okay.  That's, that's, that's why it's, you know, cool.  Oh, like people haven't squeezed their sister's boobs.  Wendy, you're topless in there?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  What's your name?  Jeff. 
[02:02:00]  Sir?  Jeff?  Jeff.  All right.  Jeff.  Step over to the box.  All right.  Cop a feel.  You know what maybe we should do to ease her up a little bit?  What?  Maybe we line up all the guys to the side so she can't see who's walking up.  Oh, yeah.  You got to guess which, uh, which hands are your brother's.  How's that?  What does she get if she gets it right?  Wait, put a blindfold on him.  Yeah, we don't.  What does she get if she gets it right?  If she gets it right, then you guys get to meet Jim Brewer backstage.  How's that?  She'll get it right.  Oh, like I know my brother's hands.  All right.  Get back out of the box. 
[02:02:30]  We got to put it up.  Nothing tells me the feel won't be as passionate as everybody else's.  We got to put a blindfold on you.  Yeah, put a blindfold on.  Get stinky in here.  We need a bunch of different hands.  But now someone is going to have to look in.  Get her all big black hands, too.  Get her all.  Someone's going to have to look in and make sure that there's contact.  And it's not just an errant little brush of a nip.  No, Rick, you can do it.  You got to grab on.  Rick, you can do it from the back door, right?  Hey, hey.  Wait a minute.  We're just talking.  No, that's not the back door of the box.  He just said a BJ with my stuff. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, I thought we were talking about that still.  Sorry.  Don't marry me.  Carlos.  Hello.  Hey, Carlos.  What's going on, Owen?  Hey.  I don't know.  That is disgusting what you guys are doing right now.  Hey, shut up.  You're going to reen it.  You're going to reen it.  Don't reen it, Carlos.  Shut up.  You'll be listening.  Hey, check his ID.  It's not even his sister.  Shut up, you reen it.  They want to go see Brewer, man.  No, they're brother and sister.  You can tell.  All right, thank you.  I'm hanging up.  Hang up on him.  He's going to reen it.  You're going to reen it. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Wendy is blindfolded.  She's blindfolded in the box.  Oh, God.  Michelle, what's up?  You guys, I love you to death, but you've reached an all-time low.  No.  Where are you going?  This is a sin.  I have a brother, and there's no way on God's earth I would let him do this to me.  Hey, shut up.  You were doing it for Jim Brewer tickets?  Right.  No, I'm telling you.  There's not a chance.  I'd be in therapy for the rest of my life.  Oh, you're all hung up.  Oh, yeah, okay.  I don't want my brother to touch me.  You've got hang-ups.  You'll be listening. 
[02:04:00]  Who's going away?  Come on.  There's nothing else to listen to in the afternoon.  Right.  Where are you going?  To listen to a rack-track?  All right.  Here he goes.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Somewhere in the line.  No, hold on.  What's up, Bob?  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  We're lining up the guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got Wendy in the box.  Wendy, you topless?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You guys are guaranteed the Jim Brewer tickets.  If you guess which one is your brother feeling you up, you get to meet Jim Brewer backstage.  What's wrong, Stink? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, Stink.  I'm out of Stink.  You're even disgusted by the show today.  I feel bad about this.  No, no, no.  Shut up, you're eating.  All right.  You cannot say a word.  No saying a word.  And no, like, little Morse code tweaks or anything.  You just got to do what everyone else does.  What we will do here, gentlemen, you will step up to the box, put your hands in, grab a hold,  give a little, you know, juggle, a little, little bouncy bounce, a little feelage, a little brushing with the hands, 
[02:05:00]  and then you step away.  Then the next guy goes.  And if we can contain ourselves, when the brother comes up, it'll be an effing miracle.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because I don't even want to look.  I think one, two, three.  We have one.  Okay.  Yeah, we do have six.  Six guys.  Yeah.  This is what we should do.  Everyone gets a feel.  Right.  Give each one of these guys a number, and then Wendy's got to guess what number was the brother.  Why is everyone so close?  Because Rick's giving out the numbers. 
[02:05:30]  Wendy doesn't know if you go, you're one, you're two, you're three, you're four.  She's blindfolded.  Okay.  All right.  Are we ready?  I'm not looking over at the box.  I'm just going to laugh at every person that steps up to the box.  All right.  She can't see a damn thing, and her shirt is totally open.  This game is called guess which one is your brother filling you up?  Filling you up.  Now, very popular game in South Carolina. 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  Rick, or somebody, the most important part of this is confirmation of contact.  Okay.  You can't really see one's arms go in that hole.  Right.  So someone has to look.  And Ben, keep that mic on, Wendy.  Okay.  Number one.  Number one, step right up to the box.  And Wendy, don't say anything until everyone has felt you up.  There's no talking.  That's no talking.  Number one.  All right.  Wendy?  I can hardly hear you guys. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  All right.  That guy felt you up, right?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Number two.  Step up to the box.  Step up.  And he puts his arms in.  Rick, can you see back there?  Confirmed.  Okay.  Very good.  There is number two.  All right.  Number three is stepping up to the box.  Both hands, sir.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Did number three fill you up when?  Yeah.  Okay.  Number four.  All right.  Number four.  Number five.  Number five.  Did number five fill you up?  That's confirmed.  Rick, you've seen everyone fill her up?  I've seen everybody so far.  And finally, number six.  Yep.  All right.  Here comes number six.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  And here's number seven.  People are coming in the studio.  Number seven.  All right.  Okay.  All right, Wendy.  Everyone in the studio has felt you up.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You already have Jim Brewer tickets for Irving Plaza December 9th.  We're all going.  And your brother has tickets as well.  For the backstage passes to meet Jim Brewer, which number was your brother?  Between three and four. 
[02:08:00]  Four?  Three?  All right.  Is that your final answer?  You need one.  Would you like three and four to fill you up again?  Yeah.  Maybe you've got to get three and four again.  Yeah.  Three and four.  Three and four.  Line up to the box.  You seem a little confused.  So, number three.  If you can step up to the box again.  Number three.  Up to the box.  Now, three and four.  Two hands.  Both of you.  Yeah, that was the, I think three and four were the ones that used the one-hand combo. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  That might have caused the confusion.  Both hands.  All right.  Once again, it's down to three or four.  Which one is Wendy's brother?  All right.  That's number three.  Did number three fill you up?  Yep.  All right.  And number four.  All right, Wendy.  For the meet and greet with Jim Brewer, which one was your brother?  Three?  Yes. 
[02:09:00]  Number three.  It popped up your sister.  That is your rule.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How did you know it was three?  It was you, sir.  Wendy?  Wendy?  I always know that.  Wendy, how did you know?  Wendy, how did you know?  Really quick.  It was a real quick hand.  Well, four was pretty quick, too.  Right.  And how was it filling up your sis? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, how were they?  What do you think, though?  No, really?  Like, how did they feel?  No comment.  No comment?  No.  Did you like, like, as far as boobs go, if they weren't attached to your sister, would  they be nice?  I haven't even thought of it.  I'm thinking of it that way right now.  Why?  You got to.  No.  All right.  God, who is listening to this?  All right.  Hands down her pants now.  No.  If you guys make out, we'll give you tickets for Jay Moore.  Rascals West Orange, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. 
[02:10:00]  Love you, Jay, but no thank you.  How did that feel now with your brother's hand?  Very, very awkward.  On your boobs.  They're not even looking at each other now.  They're pretty nice, though, right?  Good.  You got to fess up.  Take yourself out of it emotionally like you're a Vulcan.  We've seen your sister's boobs.  They're nice.  Yeah, they're nice.  Good for her.  Yeah, whip them out.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Take a look.  They're just brass.  Look.  Look.  Take a look.  He will not turn around. 
[02:10:30]  He'll feel them, though.  He won't turn around and look.  Wow.  That rocks.  Dude, can you imagine the dreams both of them were going to have?  You guys already gave me torturous nightmares before, and now I'm doing it again.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Every time I come on this show.  Unbelievable.  Thanks, guys.  You all right now?  Yeah?  No.  Yeah?  You felt up your sister, and all it cost us was a couple tickets.  And a meet and greet. 
[02:11:00]  Wait until Brewer finds out why he's meeting and greeting you.  Why?  He might ask for a live demonstration.  Wow.  Now, how many boobs have you touched?  A lot?  Oh, my God.  A few?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're married?  You're married.  What a great way to feel other people's boobs.  You just cheated with your sister.  You cheated with your sister, dude.  What a great way to get around that loophole that you can't touch other boobs when you're 
[02:11:30]  married.  Hey, it's my sister.  Can I break the news to your wife?  No.  Maybe she's giving a handy to her brother.  No, I'm kidding.  Now, stop.  Dude, he's the big guy.  Be careful.  I know.  Bob, what's up?  You guys are effing sick bastards.  Hey, we didn't touch our sister's boobs.  That's right.  The thing you guys do is unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  That's nice.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  All right.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:12:00]  The incest couch.  I just hope Jeff doesn't call his wife by his sister's name.  James, what's up?  Guys, this guy is going right to hell.  Why?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, they're just boobs.  You know, in some countries, that's common.  He's married and he's feeling up his sister?  I'm safe.  And, Rick, you can confirm that he felt up Wendy, his sister.  Yeah, not only once, but twice.  Yeah, twice.  Right to hell.  There's no coming back with this guy.  Rick, what type of technique did he use?  Was it the fingers up grab or the fingers underneath the bottom kind of bounce them a little? 
[02:12:30]  It was more like when you're sticking your hand into some place, you're not sure where it's supposed to go.  So it was just kind of one hand.  Yeah.  And then he quickly grabbed so he wouldn't get bit by the snake and pulled out.  Pulled his hand out.  Right.  And they were nice, though, right?  Firm and...  All right.  Wonderful.  Let's go for the...  Wonderful, see?  Let's go for the dirty Sanchez.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Well, you guys got the backstage.  Very good.  For Jim Brewer. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Wendy.  There you go.  Wendy and her brother on the O&A show.  Nice.  Thank you, guys.  Nice.  Goddamn that.  That rolls.  This show has just taken so many twists and turns into depravity.  Love it.  You fit right in.  Be proud.  You guys know so.  Be proud.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Call.  This is a go.  Over.  If you have any self-respect, aren't you embarrassed to yourself, to your family? 
[02:13:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Hell in human crime.  1027 WNEW.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, Anthony.  Coddle from New York.  Trying to be a comedian, but very funny here.  Confession.  I met the after-school specials where the chick has the problem.  The sicker the problem, the more the bats.  Now, that's a fun new game. 
[02:14:00]  The after-school special.  Starring Valerie Bertinelli.  Bertinelli.  Turn it back to Bertinelli.  Yes.  That's a lifetime favor.  There's outlash key kids that have to come home, and they're the single parent is at work.  So they have to heat up their own Campbell suit.  I'm Sarah, and I cut.  I'm a cutter.  I'm a cutter.  And you told me.  I thought it was drugs and sex. 
[02:14:30]  It turns out she's a cutter.  I didn't know about this.  And then the shrink has to tell the parents,  this is a very popular and serious thing that happens these days.  A cutter.  A cutter.  Those were always the best.  The after-school special.  Yeah, you take it.  I'm Beth, and I pull out my eyelashes.  Yeah.  Because my mommy didn't love me.  So it's a portrait of a teenage slut.  You take my breath away.  I don't know what to say. 
[02:15:00]  You take my breath away.  That was an after-school special song.  That was it was.  I remember that.  What was that story about?  Oh, take my breath away.  Remember the one Eve Plum was in Jan Brady?  It was Sarah's Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic or something.  Nice.  And, yeah, that wasn't an after-school special,  but it was one of those family movies that you watched with your parents.  And she was just a raging drunk in school with a little vodka bottle. 
[02:15:30]  And it was like, it's Jan Brady.  I'm drinking with George Clark.  This is great.  I used to love those after-school specials.  Yeah.  Tuttle makes a good point.  The sicker they are.  Oh, yeah.  There was the one about the girl and, God, what was it?  Oh, the father was the kid-toucher.  And her father was doing things to her.  And it was Ted Danson, I think. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, Ted Danson was the father, and he's touching the kid.  That would rock.  And the kid was too scared to tell anyone?  Yeah.  Don't remember the name of that one either.  And, you know, justice always prevails.  And then there was the one with the, like I was saying,  the guy that played the school admissions guy from Risky Business.  Oh, God, yeah.  Mazer.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  And he was the kid-toucher, and it was the little kid from one of the vacation movies. 
[02:16:30]  It was the girl.  Was she recorded as a rock?  Yeah.  He was taking pictures of her on the rock in the park.  And just at first, he was just taking regular pictures.  And he was like, okay, why don't you pull your shirt down a little bit?  And she was like, oh, Howie.  And she just started, he started snapping the picture.  He goes, it's okay, you're like a supermodel.  You're like Farrah Fawcett.  Just take your shirt down a little bit.  I felt disgusting watching this show. 
[02:17:00]  Okay.  And then the mother burst into the apartment,  and there's, like, boys on the floor eating pizza.  And the mother starts beating the crap out of him.  It was great.  Richard Mazur was his name.  We have a song to play, though.  And this is, oh.  This will bring back memories to the older listeners of our show.  After school special music.  Yeah.  Who did this, Rick?  Rick Smith.  Rick Smith.  Remember Rick Smith?  There he goes. 
[02:17:30]  Was this the after school special where Helen Hunt got PCP?  Remember that one?  Or is this the Scott Baio after school special, Stone?  Take my breath away.  Take your palm and take a shot.  You, you, you, you.  Smile and it's okay. 
[02:18:00]  Take my breath away.  Oh, ah.  What a promise of me.  All right.  On a simple and summer day.  Don't just stare at it.  And will you save my breath away.  Oh, ah.  For the magic of the sunrise.  What about are you sick and hooners, huh?  I thought I told you to shut up. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, ah.  For me.  You were to take my breath away.  So fast.  And I don't know what to say.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  And dance.  Oh, ah.  Let's go.  Sweet, magical crunch.  Oh, ah.  Hey, he keeps ricking his finger.

[02:33:00]  Let's go to Tony on the phone.  Tony.  Hey, do you remember that after school special where the guy always peed his bed and the mom let the sheets out?  That was the Michael Landon story.  Very good.  The Michael Landon story.  He was a track star and he peed himself.  That's a true story.  That's what happened to Michael Landon when he was growing up.  He was a track star.  He peed his bed and his mom used to hang the urine stained sheets out the window.  For the whole neighborhood to see.  Bedwetter.  Bedwetter. 
[02:33:30]  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Dave.  I guess we got to take a little break.  Breaks?  Yeah.  A break.  I put on the breaks.  A break snowboard.  A break.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are back.  1927 WNEW.  212-757-1027. 
[02:34:00]  Hanging out with Jay Moore.  He's hosting Regis and Kelly tomorrow.  Guest hosting.  Regis is on vacation.  On vacation.  We'll all be checking that out tomorrow morning.  I'm leaving my show in the trustworthy hands of Jay Moore.  I am easy.  Can we go?  Wherever I am, you can be going on.  I love it.  Call Caroline for ticket info.  I don't know what's going on with the tickets to the Jay Moore show.  Much like my old shows with Kathy Lee at Westbury Music Fair. 
[02:34:30]  In the round.  I sing songs.  It would sell out with the rooms from the Midwest.  Did I do a show at Westbury Music Fair yet?  Yeah.  How'd it go?  It was there last weekend.  Did it go good?  It was great, Jay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just saying it was great.  It was packed, and there was a fight.  Have you ever done comedy in the round?  It's a little strange.  It's cool to see that.  I couldn't keep my fat ass away from other people.  It's in the round, you see? 
[02:35:00]  You know, I'm talking to people over here now, and my ass is over here.  Jay, what are you saying?  I got a big ass?  Yeah.  There was a funny moment, because he was trying to do a callback from, you know, something  he did earlier in his act, but he didn't know where the person was.  He was trying to point to the guy.  Because the stage is spinning.  So he was supposed to point.  Like, if you're on stage, you know the guy's stage left.  He's in the second row.  You go, like this guy over here.  Right.  He wanted to go back to it.  You know, something he did, like, 20 minutes ago.  A guy with beige pants. 
[02:35:30]  So he's looking for the guy, and he didn't know where he was.  Like this guy.  Where the hell is he?  Right.  He's doing circles.  It was hilarious.  Did the stage spin?  Well, it wasn't spinning that night.  No, it wasn't spinning, but, you know, because it's in the round, he's moving around, like,  you know.  It only spins when REO Speedwagon's there.  I was going to say, what did he say, Tiny Dancer?  Right.  I saw Yes in the round once.  Really?  Like a rock.  Did you do Acid?  Pretty much.  Jeez.  I think it was Shrooms that night.  And the stage just slowly rotates, yeah.  He comes out, though.  Maybe he wasn't rotating.  He was in the restroom. 
[02:36:00]  He told us he rotated.  Right.  He comes out like a DICE superhero, the action figure.  He's got, like, these pants now that he wears them.  Ridiculous.  You know, he's got these big, huge pants, but they're not, like, ghetto huge.  They're not baggy.  They just, the legs go straight down like two big tree trunks.  Like David Byrne in, uh, Stop Making Sense?  Yeah, but only their, uh, jeans.  They're like, uh, denim.  And they're huge.  It's the carpenter cut.  I like it.  Go to the gas.  It's the carpenter cut. 
[02:36:30]  There's the boot cut.  And then he's got the good leather jacket with the studs all over it.  And he's like, look, I'm a transformer.  I turn into a rocket ship.  It's unbelievable, this guy.  And then we get in a fight, or they get in a fight.  I left beforehand at previous engagement.  You got in a fight?  Well, it's not.  Rick and his, uh, wife and everything with this mullet-headed Joe Dirt-looking chick that  was sitting, uh, two rows, two rows in front. 
[02:37:00]  I did not expect the word chick to follow that mullet-headed Joe Dirt-looking...  Oh, she was a chick.  And she had this...  A hilarious blonde.  She was so obnoxious and so drunk.  Yeah, all drunk.  She's trying to take pictures.  And then she's just like, eh, eh, eh.  And somebody told her to sit down and shut up.  And she wouldn't shut up.  And these guys told her to be quiet.  And then she spit on Rick and, uh, Rick's wife.  I would have punched her in the mouth.  And Rick tried to.  Security came over.  And then they're, like, holding her back.  So Rick just goes right up to her face and goes, yeah, you effin' see.  Like, right there.  And then she goes, take a slinger and security throw it, like, hey, speed. 
[02:37:30]  It sounds like a great brawl.  It was a very fun time.  I'm sorry I missed it.  It was hilarious.  Uh, Drudge Jr. is on the phone, Anthony.  I don't understand that type of people coming to a size show.  Drudge.  Hey.  Drudgy.  Um, I just had some information on Christopher Walken.  Oh, you have info on, uh...  Christopher Walken.  Well, I'd love to hear it.  Well, a year ago, he was in some sort of musical called Waking the Dead or something like that.  Uh. 
[02:38:00]  Where he, uh, he was singing, uh, a really long song called, uh, Snowflung to the Universe or something.  It's down a lot of masters.  The funniest thing you'll ever hear.  Uh, Jay, just to fill you in, this guy wants to be just like his hero, Drudge.  No, he's not the last time I was on, he called up.  Oh, okay.  All right, so this is like, uh, Drudge Jr.  He wears the hat and everything.  This isn't breaking news or anything, is it?  Oh, I guess not.  I'm sure some people saw it.  I thought you had a scoop for us today.  This kid needs Paxil or something.  Every time you're on the phone, you tell him you're about to jump out a window. 
[02:38:30]  Paxil.  Paxil.  No, it's not really breaking news after all.  It just sounds like Eeyore.  Hey, Drudge, what are you working on?  Oh, no.  Well, um...  Don't I get in the coffin, kid?  What are you working on?  What are you working on, Drudge?  Well, the Pat Cooper thing.  Oh.  Fascinating, sir.  Can't say it on the radio, but...  Pat Cooper, hot seller.  Pat Cooper, huh?  Okay.  I was also thinking about maybe running for mayor. 
[02:39:00]  You got to be a certain age so you're out of the loop, my man.  I think there's a pubic hail in it, sir.  You know, I can't win, but I just think it'd be funny if I ran for mayor and I got a lot of votes.  Can't run with less than eight pubes.  Get in the coffin.  No, I don't enjoy it coming by.  He's so small, he pees on his nuts.  Oh, that's a good line.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, Drudge Jr. 
[02:39:30]  I'm doing the impressions here.  Is it Anthony or Jay Moore?  Ah.  Neither.  Otto and George are here.  And Christopher Walken.  I mean, the studio's still.  Hey, don't forget Joe Pesci comes in here like a freaking brad roll, standing here waiting for everybody to talk to me.  I mean, in the lobby, some girl's like, wow, what the hell are you going to wow, you stupid sea sucker?  I'm standing here like a brad roll, like a colored guy in the street corner, and you're standing there with your judge's house over here, you know?  I really got him going, you stunnering prick, and I got him.  Judge, when do you crawl for the report, Drudge? 
[02:40:00]  What's his name?  Junior.  Drudge Jr.  Drudge?  Drudge.  Yes.  In this day and age.  When do you go put your head in love and your balloon head Jesus?  I really like go, Jay.  Great pizza work.  That was good.  That was good.  Drudge wasn't always horrible.  Are you being sarcastic?  Hey, look, I'd be willing to point out some horrible Jay Moore movies, but that was, go was a great movie.  Except for the lap dancing scene.  Why?  Because it's too sexy and with girls and vaginas in it? 
[02:40:30]  Well, not any scenes you were on.  No, why was the lap dancing scene not good?  I said that was good.  Well, you said except for the lap dancing.  The whole movie sucked except for the lap dancing scene.  Oh, you see.  That's what I was trying to do there.  But the stripper in that scene was four months or five months pregnant.  Really?  Yeah.  Talk about needing some money for the pipe.  That's hot.  All right, Drudge.  Okay.  Sorry, I wasn't funny.  No?  Wow, don't kill yourself. 
[02:41:00]  Sorry, I wasn't funny.  Drudge, that's not your job on our show.  Your job is to get, you know, the scoops.  Tell us what you're working on.  I thought that was a scoop.  You should download that song.  It's really funny to hear him sing.  All right.  Thank you.  Go ask Christopher Robin for some Lidl-ing.  All right, Drudge.  Christopher Robin.  There you go.  This kid's just calling from the oven.  He's actually inside the oven on a little pan.  We like to Drudge Jr.  He's what, 13, 14?  Yeah.  I'm going to go kill myself.  I'm going to go start my mom's car in the garage at the door down. 
[02:41:30]  He's going to get a little older and look back and go, God, I'm a psycho tool.  We all do.  Don't take a personal, he Drudge Jr.  Looking at the computer with the people on hold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I can save us some time and energy.  Rob, yes, I'm going to play Rutgers.  That's, I just read the screen, so.  When are you playing Rutgers?  Look, he just went away now.  When are you playing Rutgers?  I'm not sure.  The 26th.  The 26th.  Black guy knows every day the payday comes.  Leave my money.  Yeah, 26. 
[02:42:00]  You can't.  You can't.  Do some of that karate, Elvis.  All right.  I got that white woman I got to pay for.  Give me Elvis.  That's good.  Jay Moore brought you.  He's lost married to a white woman, and his baby looks like Johnny Morton of, like, the Detroit Lions.  How is that, man?  He's still married to a white woman.  Yeah, she's blonde.  She's like children of the corn.  Blonde, blonde, blonde.  Blue, blue, blue.  Nice.  She's an albino, sir.  My son's got blue eyes and brown skin. 
[02:42:30]  He's going to be a good-looking kid.  Cool.  You pump out supermodels like that.  I swear to God.  Yeah, yo.  It's how the supermodels are born, right?  Yeah.  Girls out there, if you want some of this good sperm, let me know.  Yo, wait a minute.  I'm the one who got the sperm on sale.  You got filthy Puerto Rican sperm.  Old type, baby.  No, Old Dirty is really selling his sperm, Jack.  Yeah, he's selling it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm going to fill the earth with my sea, kid.  What?  Oh, my God.  I'd say to go to the adoption agency and pick up your Puerto Rican. 
[02:43:00]  Here's your kid, and he had his crib lowered, and he's got dice hanging from his nuts.  They're just saving it up for when they could sell kids in vending machines.  Ah!  That's why I pump them out.  What's wrong, Old Dirty?  Nothing.  I'm seeing what Rick is writing.  What's your sperm per cc when you got it done?  Well, I was shooting.  I fainted out loads, kid.  I don't know what she's doing.  No, but you got to know how many active little guys you got.  Yeah, because you all like the count?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  My seeds is on jet skis, son. 
[02:43:30]  That's true.  Come on.  Yeah, he's Puerto Rican.  Come on.  He's dropping them off at the doorknock.  They're digging and jagging.  Crazy.  They're Puerto Rican, man.  Strong swimmers.  Maybe it can help out Jay.  Jay didn't have a good count.  Oh, why?  Yeah, it was a little rough for Jay.  Maybe you got to eat some rice and beans, dog.  Rice and beans.  That's the trick.  And fried bananas.  There you go.  Jay went for the sperm count.  Word.  Yeah.  But, like, what's that, though? 
[02:44:00]  Like, they count how many thousands are going to make it into the final running?  How many millions?  How many are swimming and how mobile they are?  Yeah, how well they swim, if they got two heads or 16 tails.  Come on, man.  The nurse told me my whole posse was on jet skis.  That's a good thing, man.  Right?  Would you go to the clinic?  She really said that?  Yeah, you know.  Good times.  Baby, your sperm is on jet skis right on.  I know mine.  I got your hands on them. 
[02:44:30]  Damn, damn, damn.  She told me that they were, like, it was a whole mad.  I didn't get the number, though, man.  They were just mad crazy, right?  Yeah, so I got skis.  You're mad at jays.  Jay's are on a raft.  Jay's are on a raft.  Jay's look like a castaway.  Jay's came up with a little duke egg.  Jay's sperm floating around on a raft trying to find the egg.  I'm holding martinis.  Right.  They're pumping into each other.  Punching some sperm. 
[02:45:00]  Come on, sperm.  Smarten up.  There's hot teenage kids running around this place.  Like, get it together.  Got sniffed it in their hands.  Oh, bo, bo, bo, bo.  Come on.  Kelly Ripley, get it together.  Doug from Springfield.  Doug.  I heard OD's selling a sperm.  I want to get some.  My female monkey wants to have a baby.  Sorry, OD.  Later, guys.  He's Dominican.  I know who that was.  He's Dominican.  I know who that was.  Yeah, who was that?  Petey.  Petey.  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm doing good. 
[02:45:30]  Everyone's doing good.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, is this guy just all dirty?  Is he a Moulignan or is he a Reacon?  What is he?  I ain't no Moulignan.  I'm the guy you come to buy your cocaine from.  Look, now, look.  I ain't buying no cocaine.  What I understand is, if you're not a Moulignan, why are you using all this, you know, mad crazy  and mad ripe and all this BS?  Because it's from the neighborhood he's in.  Yeah, that's right, man.  But if he's a Reacon, he's not going to talk like that.  He's going to, like, you know, use the Reacon terminology.  What is it?  What?  Because you're so adept at knowing what language I'm speaking.  Look, I'm not preaching. 
[02:46:00]  You know what it is then, punk?  I'm not preaching to that militaristic information.  Why'd you, like, you know, malign the English language a little more here?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Come and get your Coke at six, man.  You'll be there.  You're Dominican.  Is that the story you're trying to pass or you're Dominican?  It's a Dominicano, loco.  What's the process, loco?  Dominicano story from, like, Washington Heights or what here?  Yeah, that's right.  Washington Heights, my brother.  What nationality are you, sir?  What nationality?  I'm English.  I'm English.  No, you're not.  You came in Italian and then you faded into black and then I...  What makes you think I'm Italian? 
[02:46:30]  Because I said, how you doing?  How you doing?  What?  Because I said, how you doing?  You assume I'm Italian?  Is that it?  Why are you talking like you're from Brooklyn, dude?  I'm not from Brooklyn.  I'm not from Brooklyn.  What are you talking about?  You forgot to change your voice before you got excited?  Hey, Petey.  Petey, what are you about, man?  What?  What are you about?  I'm not about anything.  I'm just curious whether O.D.B. was above...  Guy, get in the coffin.  You touched children.  All right, thank you.  Bye, Angie.  Who needs that?  I'm never going to England.  Andrew.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, O.D. is like the Puerto Rican Ralph Crandon.  He always has a get-rich-quick scheme. 
[02:47:00]  I'm selling my sperm!  Alex!  Get your foot out of the handcuffs.  Get your foot out, Norton!  Alice, we are going to be rich.  Easy streets coming.  I'm selling my sperm.  Getting Mrs. Manacotti down here to give me a handy.  Alice, where are the pots?  I'm selling my sperm.  Where are the pots?  Start whacking, Norton.  Alice, where's the sugar?  It's all got you better with sugar on it.  Where's the sugar, Alice? 
[02:47:30]  I'll throw a batch and take you all to Hong Kong Garden.  Oh, man.  Bravo.  You've got a lot of the honeymooners.  Come on.  I'm going to take some down to Mr. Marshall.  It's your squeeze plate.  I'm Marshall. 
[02:48:00]  I'm Marshall.  Father Sam, how would you like to buy the finest sperm you could purchase?  Don't answer yet, Father Sam.  Because I'm also going to give you the pot.  Father Sam, you want my sperm?  It's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Rachel, I'm giving sperm...  I'm giving you...  ...in my...  ...plevenies.  No more mambo.  I've got to get cranking. 
[02:48:30]  Did you take any sperm from Carlos?  Or were you just mamba dancing?  Who's sperm is in this club?  Carlos.  Ah, cocktail time, huh?  Come on out, Hob.  Harvey.  When he walks in and...  You remember Harvey?  Yeah, they just left.  They just left.  They just left and they're having a martini.  So he comes in.  There's two martini guys.  So the table, the first thing he says,  Ah, ah, ah, oh, cocktail time, huh? 
[02:49:00]  Ah, who, ah?  Where is he?  I'll tell him if I'm in.  You never been with a bus driver, Hob?  Oh, jeez.  That's great.  I didn't know Davey Crockett was so fat.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot of protein, Hob.  Mix the baby batter.  See, that's mine also.  Baby batter, that's mine. 
[02:49:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  And baby airbag batter, Sam.  Don't leave anything for the clean-up crew.  Sonny boy, back up.  Here it comes.  I had it, we all had it.  Easy come, easy go.  I'll inseminate everyone. 
[02:50:00]  Give me a bag of shells.  The whole country burning her allegation.  Or, I'm sorry, Crandon.  It's got to work, Alice.  I'm dropping them off at the dogs.  I sound like Regis.  That's great.  Oh, God damn.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Yo, can you call sperm core apple?  Can it core apple?  Jack for the future, man. 
[02:50:30]  Jack for the future.  Yeah, you guys shut up, man.  Take it easy.  All right, Mike.  Got to love honeymooner references.  All right, we're going to take a break.  1027.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breath.  Boom.  Wow.  WNEW.  This story is the headline, spanking cure for neck ache. 
[02:51:00]  What?  This is a sick story, too.  Spanking cure for neck ache.  What is this?  A chiropractor?  Right?  The chiropractor spanked the sportswoman's bottom after she went to him with whiplash injuries a court heard yesterday.  A court?  She's suing now?  The chiropractor, because he decided that, you know, to get rid of her whiplash or her neck pain, he needed to spank her.  Steve, like having a background?  Ian, 37, also probed intimate areas of her body. 
[02:51:30]  Nice.  Sometimes without wearing gloves.  What, that makes it offensive if you don't have the gloves on?  Why wear gloves?  It doesn't feel as good.  If you're going to molest somebody, I mean, really.  So if the doctor, like, invades your balloon knot with the glove on, it's like, eh, no big deal.  But if he doesn't have the glove on, then there's the problem?  Well, if you're a chiropractor and he's spanking the balloon knot, that's a problem.  Proctologist could probably get away with it with the glove on. 
[02:52:00]  Or without the glove.  Could you imagine that, though?  It's like, you go to a proctologist and get up and you see him put the glove on.  Jesus.  I enjoy my work.  I call this my stinky pinky.  This is my stinky pinky.  Here it is.  Here it goes.  Let me just...  Yeah.  All right.  No, you feel fine.  Yeah.  Damn, this story's turning me on. 
[02:52:30]  Let's see this one, man.  Ah.  The chiropractor asked the 30-year-old to bring in a stick so that he could perform a nerve block test on her buttock.  A stick?  Bring in a stick so that he could perform a nerve block test on her buttock.  On her buttock.  Nice.  The test at the clinic allegedly involved whipping her bottom until it left her sore and bruised. 
[02:53:00]  That's good.  Well, that's one way to forget about the neck pain.  Butt-sick.  Uh...  He usually locked the door of his office and never offered a chaperone during some 160 therapy sessions with the same girl.  When do you figure that the guy is, you know, molesting you?  Yeah.  It wasn't like the first or second time.  It took 160 visits before she realized, wait, wait, there's a problem here.  This isn't right.  Wow.  On one occasion, he asked a woman who is a keen athlete to bring alcohol to his clinic. 
[02:53:30]  What, like to drink?  Because she was tense.  Bring a stick so I could spank you.  Bring some alcohol because you're tense.  You've got to lighten up.  Yeah.  You like that, don't you, bitch?  The woman's boyfriend became suspicious and took photographs of her alleged injuries to the police.  Oh, my God.  We have audio from the judge in this case. 
[02:54:00]  You're getting the finger-banging old Mary Jane Rottencroft through her pretty pink panties are over.  Wow, he sounded pissed.  So they arrest the chiropractor at his home?  Yeah.  And this is what he had to say.  Stay out the bushes!  No, he said, Anthony, if you will allow me here.  Don't just stare at him.  No, no, no.  I don't know what he was saying.  No, no.  Okay.  If you would let me, they arrested the chiropractor. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  And he had this to say.  You're a filthy whore!  That's not what he said, you asked.  All right.  What did he say?  All right, listen.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  Ann, please.  Right.  We're trying to do serious news on this show.  All right.  All right.  So they go to the chiropractor's house and they arrest him. 
[02:55:00]  Uh-huh.  And, uh, the chiropractor said...  Cancel your appointment!  Come on.  No.  There's one line left in the story, Ed.  Okay.  I'm trying to, uh, listen.  I don't know what happened.  All right.  All right.  So, uh, they went to the guy's house, the chiropractor.  Right.  Who molested this lady, obviously, after 160 visits.  Right.  And he had this to say. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, man, this is so bad!  Yeah.  I'm listening.  Okay.  All right.  So they arrest the guy.  Right.  And, uh, he had this to say to the...  He had this to say to the police.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Now the line sucks. 
[02:56:00]  No, I think you're looking for, uh...  What?  For this.  I'm never hearing that!  No!  All right.  Are we done?  All right.  Well, no.  What did he say?  What did he say?  The chiropractor said...  You ever seen a grown man naked?  I'm trying to get to what he said. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  Well, they went to his house.  They asked the chiropractor.  The cops go over.  They arrest him.  We've gotten to that point.  You're such a dick.  Yeah.  And, uh, they, you know, had taken him away in handcuffs.  Yeah.  And, uh, he said...  Screw you guys!  I'm doing him!  All right.  Look, look.  My hands are totally at my side. 
[02:57:00]  Okay.  The chiropractor said...  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Ha, ha, ha.  Sure is fine, Wolf.  How about a first gun?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  If I can, Anthony.  All right.  I'm not doing anything.  Why is your hand on the button? 
[02:57:30]  Now, look, look.  My hands are up.  Now the line sucks, but this is what he said.  Well, if it's what he actually said, then that's, uh, that's fine.  Let's hear what he actually said.  Hey, everybody!  We're all gonna get laid!  Uh, he said...  Okay, terrific!  He said it.  But you will kill!  Oh, screw what he said. 
[02:58:00]  It doesn't matter, anyway.  You suck.  This is not, uh, the Discovery Channel.  This is the Opie Anthony Show.  The movies and, uh, black-dark show.  This is the Opie Anthony Show.  This is the Opie Anthony Show. </pre>
