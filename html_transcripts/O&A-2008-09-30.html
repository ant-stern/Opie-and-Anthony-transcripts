<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a furious rant about the failed economic bailout plan, with Opie employing highly offensive language to describe Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank.  They mocked the news media's attempts to explain the complex financial situation and discussed the market's dramatic drop, speculating on day trading opportunities and the surprisingly resilient Campbell's Soup stock. Opie lamented his own struggling stand-up comedy ticket sales, joking about price hikes and mandatory drink minimums. A caller then delivered the bad news about the plummeting value of Opie's Citadel stock.

The conversation shifted to commonly used media clichés like "a heartbeat away from the presidency" and "what's good for Wall Street might not be good for Main Street," which they satirized extensively.  They jokingly proposed a McCain-Palin VP swap and engaged in a playful exploration of the word "queer."  Their discussion then turned to the lack of cooperation in Washington during the bailout vote, focusing on the Republicans and Democrats' refusal to compromise, and noting the timing of the Jewish holidays.  Opie and Anthony debated the merits of the bailout, ultimately favoring a "survival of the fittest" approach and continuing their criticism of Nancy Pelosi.

A rumor was planted on-air about Sarah Palin's potential withdrawal from the presidential race due to leaked nude photos.  A "Primetime Gossip" segment hinted at a possible departure of a show employee, "Stunt Brain."  The hosts then announced the arrival of in-studio guests Rich Vos and Colin Quinn. Vos revealed he was scheduled for extensive dental work the next day.  The show then revisited the overused media phrases, playing montages of the soundbites. They discussed Obama's rising popularity in the context of the economic crisis, drawing comparisons to Clinton's 1992 victory.  A video featuring a Southern woman expressing vehemently anti-Obama views due to his middle name and perceived Arab associations was played, presented as an example of "Middle America."

Further discussion of Sarah Palin’s perceived gaffes, particularly her Charlie Gibson interview about the Bush Doctrine, and the Bobby Lee MADtv skit portraying John McCain followed.  The in-studio conversation with Quinn and Vos covered the political landscape, Palin's future in the campaign, and the hosts' opinions of each other's careers.  The segment ended with more Palin commentary, a Jay Moore impersonation of Colin Quinn, and additional banter between the hosts and guests.

A humorous anecdote about a large man's violent outburst, possibly involving a Desert Eagle, and resulting in blood on Colin Quinn's shoes kicked off the next segment.  The conversation then focused on Quinn's busy schedule, his impressions (particularly of Jay Mohr), and Vos's upcoming shows at Hilarities in Cleveland.  This led to a comedic exchange about Cleveland and its homeless population.  A significant portion of this segment graphically detailed Vos's upcoming dental procedure, including the extraction of several teeth and the installation of implants.  The discussion included specific dentists' names and humorous commentary on the procedure's extensive cost and the appearance of Vos's teeth.  The hosts and Quinn also mocked Vos's Louis Vuitton bag, deemed too feminine for a man.

A phone call with Bill Donohue of the Catholic League followed, primarily concerning the film "Religulous" and Bill Maher's criticism of the Catholic Church.  They discussed the film's tone, Donohue's views on Maher's approach, and the broader issue of religious tolerance and free speech in the context of Ahmadinejad's UN visit. The conversation also included political commentary, particularly regarding Sarah Palin and the 2008 election, before concluding with plugs for upcoming appearances.

The next segment revisited the hosts' past conflict with Bill Donohue, focusing on his reliance on secondhand information when criticizing their work.  Maher and Mel Gibson were mentioned in this context. The discussion then shifted to a home invasion resulting in the intruder's death, prompting discussions of self-defense and the Second Amendment.  This led to stories about various crimes and arrests, culminating in a discussion of a Kentucky man arrested (the exact number was debated) approximately 1000 times, with his mugshots displayed.  Comedian Joe Curry ("Foot") then recounted a rambling anecdote about a nickname earned from kicking up dust while tapping his foot.  The segment also included discussions about Rich Vos, various news items (including Obama and Clinton), technical difficulties, and their upcoming contract renewal with Sirius XM.  The segment was filled with offensive language, sexual references, and discussions of violent crime.

A rambling conversation between Opie, Anthony, Rich Vos, and Jimmy dominated the following segment, jumping between various topics.  An anecdote about Rich Vos's friend, Richard, perceived as gay, led to a discussion of a childhood encounter where Rich was propositioned for oral sex.  The conversation then turned to Christy McNichol's sexuality and Richard potentially serving as her "beard."  A substantial portion focused on Rich's marital problems and infrequent sex life, laced with crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  Technical difficulties caused a brief break.  After the break, a discussion about a failed marketing deal with Danny Bonaduce and Rich's website was followed by racially charged jokes and offensive comments.  A caller's story about a teacher jailed for having sex with a minor prompted further sexually explicit and offensive commentary, along with discussions about a childhood friend of one of the hosts.  Jimmy's financial woes following stock market losses dominated the latter part of the segment, with him expressing extreme frustration and anger, using highly offensive language and even contemplating violence.  The hosts joined in with similarly aggressive and offensive comments, and the segment concluded with Jimmy still locked out of the studio, broadcasting from the hallway.


The final segment focused on the economic recession's impact on "Main Street" versus "Wall Street," interspersed with comedic bits and off-topic tangents.  A "runner-up line of the day" segment featured various crude and offensive submissions.  The hosts, along with Rich Vos, Colin Quinn, and Joe Curry (promoting their respective shows), discussed financial losses and unrelated topics.  The segment included discussions about the psychological impact of financial losses, a confused discussion on tax write-offs, and Vos's upcoming dental procedure.  Anthony's use of offensive language and sexually suggestive remarks was prominent throughout. The segment concluded with Bob Seger's "Main Street" playing over a montage, seemingly related to the earlier discussion of economic disparity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, it's good to see that everyone can work together down there in Washington.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Panic, everybody.  Panic.  Ah, the market.  My God, we are being bamboozled. 
[00:00:30]  We are being bamboozled.  Look, we're going to babble about the economic crisis that faces every American.  Well, man, I don't want to hear the local news guys giving their spin.  Oh, I know.  Ant and I were in the office preparing for the show.  So it's bad enough to see, to watch CNN and then Fox News, which has two different takes on the whole thing.  Yeah.  And then you go down to the local news level and you got some schmo that's used to, like, reporting from the city's biggest pothole trying to explain this thing to us. 
[00:01:00]  Shut up.  Yeah, they're the ones that are going to really make it clear for us.  Right, they're going to bring this whole thing home with their maybe 40 seconds of coverage on the whole thing.  You can go to, like, one of the financial channels if you really want to, you know, be bored to death and listen to them talk.  But, you know, maybe you'll get a little insight on the whole thing. 
[00:01:30]  We're not going to claim that we know anything about this, but we'll give our observations.  You know, but these guys all of a sudden, I guess the news director is like, you've got to get down there to Wall Street and say something.  Yeah.  So they're just babbling.  Outside Wall Street, which isn't going to open for hours.  Right, right, right.  So they're just standing there.  Ugh.  I blew off watching TV and then, like, late last night I turned it on before I went to bed.  And I'm like, they voted against the bailout. 
[00:02:00]  The bailout, what?  What?  What?  Well, Nancy Pelosi is the C-word.  Yeah.  She just is the C-word.  Mm-hmm.  She's a power-hungry bitch that just is screwing everything up.  And then this guy, this Barney Frank, why don't you frigging sit on a Frank and leave the, I don't know, leave the bailout to the real men. 
[00:02:30]  Jesus.  Can't stand that guy.  Barney Frank.  His name says it all.  Barney Frank.  Oof.  What a mess, man.  I mean.  Aren't they going to fix it, though?  My business guys say they're going to do something, but it will happen.  Of course it'll happen.  But this is a big bamboozle also by the upper echelon of Wall Street. 
[00:03:00]  They are making a fortune with these huge swings.  A fortune.  And they're the ones that set the tone of the buying and selling on Wall Street.  It's like, oh, well, we'll take this news and now let's make everybody panic.  So they'll start selling some stuff.  You know, it's just, the market goes down a record 777 points.  It was the biggest point loss in American history.  Not the biggest percentage, though. 
[00:03:30]  Because percentage was something around 20, I believe 25%, a 25% loss.  And it was, I think, a 17-point loss back in ye olde days of 1914.  When the market closed at $54 or something, you were telling me?  Yeah.  It was like $54 or something.  Yeah.  And they wound up losing.  There it is.  Worst percentage losses.  This one doesn't even make the top five. 
[00:04:00]  Top 10, I heard.  Well, whatever.  Top 10, probably.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, December 12, 1914.  It closed at 54 points, the Dow.  And it was a 17-point loss, so that's pretty big.  And it said 1914, by the way, over there, Danny.  19-14.  19-14.  Our doughboys are leaving for Europe.  And wow.  Yeah, this one was a 6.9, about a 7% loss. 
[00:04:30]  So, you know, it sounds like a lot at face value, but as far as leaving the country.  In current terms, though, this is, you know, when the stock market opened after 9-11, it  went down some, what, 600, I think 686 or something like that?  Yeah, 684.  684.  And it was a 7%.  Right.  And yesterday, we went down a fine, 777 points. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, and that was about 7% also, so.  And there's some good buys.  Apple went down $20.  Apple went down so much, and there's no reason for it.  Google went down 50.  Google went down 50 bucks.  But who has the balls to jump in and go, ah, I think.  You know who?  Probably Gallagher.  I bet Gallagher is making a fortune buying and selling options.  Yeah.  I bet he's buying.  You know what I would do?  I would just buy call options for Apple, Google, and just wait for it to bounce back up. 
[00:05:30]  Is this a day trader's wet dream today?  Yeah.  The way that the market's been swinging up and down, when you get these stocks that are  doing huge swings up and down, either way, you can make a fortune.  Mm-hmm.  But I'm out of the day trading business.  What's wrong with the stocks we got?  Day trade pretty good!  Apple?  Apple? 
[00:06:00]  IBM?  Citadel?  No.  Siri?  You know what's funny?  There was one company that went up yesterday.  Not one.  I'm sure there were a few.  Well, there was one on the Dow.  Right.  I think one that's actually on the Dow Jones Industrial, the S&P 500, one of them.  Was that the only stock that went up?  The only stock that went up.  Guess what the only stock to go up was yesterday, Jimmy? 
[00:06:30]  Bulletproof vests for a Wall Street executive.  It was a trampoline company, because they're going to have trampolines all around the Wall  State, Wall Street area.  Wall State.  Wall State.  Jesus.  It's my insurance company.  Wall State.  Wall State.  With good feet, people.  The answer would be Campbell's Soup.  Campbell's Soup.  Makes sense, though.  You could stock up on that stuff and live in your house while the war rages on outside 
[00:07:00]  your front door and eat soup.  Yeah.  Wow.  I should invest in can openers.  Yes.  Good luck enjoying that soup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No can openers.  What about the can opener stocks?  And spoons.  You need spoons.  How great would it be if you took over the can opener business and everyone had to line  up outside your apartment to get the can opener?  I'm going to Pittsburgh to learn about the can opener business.  You drive prices to the roof.  Right.  $1,500 for a can opener. 
[00:07:30]  You want your pea soup?  You'll pay.  Why Campbell's Soup?  I think it is.  It's a cheap food that people are stocking up on.  That you could save for a very long time.  Yeah.  It's saved for a long time.  People are getting pretty thrifty.  Things like Walmart is seeing a surge in shoppers that are going in and buying some cheap stuff.  Yeah.  Cheap clothes and stuff.  I should lower my tickets on the road.  I'm selling them for $375 a pop. 
[00:08:00]  Maybe that's the problem, Jimmy.  Plus an eight drink minimum.  Big night out to see Jimmy Norton, folks.  Eight drink.  Eight drink.  Yeah.  My shirt's now $78.  I want to attract a rich crowd.  How funny would that be?  An eight drink minimum.  Oh, but just everyone just driving into each other on the way home.  They leave completely hammered.  From a nice night of Jim Norton comedy.  It has to be alcohol and candy soda.  Oh, of course not.  Scram.  Everyone doing their Heather Locklear impression after your show. 
[00:08:30]  Cops just picking them off right out the door.  But it was an eight drink minimum.  Let's say hi to Steve in New Jersey.  How are you, Steve?  Hi, Opie.  Just wanted to let you know what your Citadel stock is worth.  Oh.  Oh, well, we appreciate this, Steve.  What is it at today?  It's at $0.67 a share.  Holy crap.  All right.  Holy mother.  Holy.  This is great.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait until they get to, at this point now, it's just a game. 
[00:09:00]  I can't wait until they get to $0.19 a share so I could say, I have one penny for every  dollar I spent.  That's when I want to, or below $0.19 so I can actually go, it's fractions of a penny  on the dollar that I spent on this.  Fractions of a penny.  What's the quick math?  How much is our stock worth now?  Oh, my God, dude.  Come on.  $6,700?  Right? 
[00:09:30]  No.  No, no.  It has to be.  $8.  It's not that far off.  Hey, we were really going after the media in the office today.  There's two terms you don't want to hear anymore.  I'm sick of it.  And maybe the listeners could help us out with other terms that the dumb media uses.  Between the election and the stock market meltdown, there are two things I'm so sick 
[00:10:00]  of hearing.  I don't want to hear another news person say this crap.  A heartbeat away from the presidency.  Enough!  A 72.  Yeah.  A 72-year-old heartbeat away from the president.  We understand how it works.  Right.  We understand.  We understand.  They're all using that term.  If he dies, the vice president takes over.  That's the way it's been.  Can we get a montage of that?  A heartbeat away.  Get the boys working on a montage. 
[00:10:30]  Montage!  Can I guess the other one?  Yes.  Is it bespectacled whore?  Yes.  Bespectacled whore is being used much too much in the media.  No, it's the whole, well, what's good for Wall Street might not be good for Main Street.  The whole Wall Street-Main Street comparison.  They're all saying it on the news.  And Obama's saying it.  Well, they're trying to bring it back to the individual. 
[00:11:00]  I call him Blow-Bama.  Blow-Bama.  That's what I call him now.  Blow-Bama's going to be the next president of this fine country of ours.  Well, not if McCain pulls the shenanigans.  I hope he wants to pull and is going to pull.  A lot of people saying that he ought to take this bespectacled whore and toss her to the side and get a new vice presidential candidate.  Right.  Because she is adult.  Every time she opens her mouth in front of somebody in the press, she says something incredibly stupid. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And points just drop off of their poll points against Obama.  Yeah.  So here's what I think McCain ought to do.  Okay.  Everybody's got to vote for McCain just to get him in.  Just to get him in so Obama ain't in there.  Because here's his secret plan.  Okay.  Get in.  Tell her she's got to pull a Spiro Agnew.  She has to resign.  Then he appoints another vice president. 
[00:12:00]  A new one.  Who would that be?  Anyone he wants.  Rudy?  Could be Rudy.  Rudy?  Could be anyone.  And then he can step down because of medical problems.  Uh-huh.  And then whoever you want to be the president is the president.  Because that's how it works.  What about the Bloomberg?  Uh, well.  What about the Barney Frank?  Barney Frank.  I just want to.  Oh. 
[00:12:30]  No smoking in bars and all stools must be turned upside down.  So I could bring three of my friends that old gag.  No smoking unless it's a cigar and it's being hammered in.  Just pink cigars, please.  Make me choke on it.  You know, uh, this is for you people at home.  Uh, we had a lot of fun using the word, the Q word in the office today.  Oh, yeah.  Well, no, no.  That word is fine because there's a TV show, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Queer Nation is another one.  Uh, gay people seem to have embraced the, the word queer as not being, um, uh, like an  insult.  It's not an insult to them.  Yep.  To them.  But us, but us straight people will ruin it.  Because now we'll like overuse the word and then they'll tell us, look, you can't use  that word anymore.  Oh, because that's offensive.  I was just saying Barney Frank is queer.  You're right.  He's queer.  What are you going to say?  He's tall. 
[00:13:30]  He's black.  He's a little weird.  Is there, is there all I'm saying?  Is there a better word to say out there than that?  It's just funny every time.  It's another old word that changed the meaning.  Right.  Like gay was, uh, you know, happy.  Gay is not as.  In the Flintstones song, we'll have a gay old time.  Gay isn't as fun to say as queer.  No.  Queer is my new favorite word to use.  For the people at home, just say queer to yourself and you'll, you'll find yourself giggling  a little.  Yeah.  It's just a fun word to say. 
[00:14:00]  That's, we can't do that.  That's queer.  Say it to your boss.  It's even more fun.  Yeah.  Call him one.  Yeah.  File the report yourself, queer.  Yeah.  It's just a fun word.  Yeah.  Um, when Barney Frank was up there, I was just yelling that at the TV screen.  Shut up.  We're just idiots.  Oh.  We're just the worst.  And now, of course, they couldn't get together with the bailout plan to get the $700 billion, 
[00:14:30]  uh, uh, this bailout money.  It's a mere bag of shells, my friend.  Mere bag of shells.  That's what I'm learning.  Why can't I get a boat with three propellers?  We can just, I love that we could just throw $700 billion at a problem if we really need  to.  Just throw money at it.  But apparently, they can't agree.  Um, that, that Speaker of the House, that, that, that, ugh.  Ugh.  Nancy Pelosi. 
[00:15:00]  Well, some people are saying she was scolding the Republicans, so they decided to turn around  and not vote for this thing, because they got mad at what she was saying.  Yeah.  That's insane if that's going on in Washington.  Do you think it is?  It is.  There's this whole us-against-them mentality.  There's no cooperation anymore, whatsoever.  A Republican or a Democrat cannot vote, uh, in kind with the opposition, or they know their  career is done. 
[00:15:30]  It'll be used against them in some future election.  Right.  And they, he voted along with his Democrat that's, you know, it's just, it, they can't  get anything done.  And if this isn't something that has a bit of urgency to it, that perhaps they ought to  throw away the fact that they're, you know, Republicans and Democrats and maybe work together  to fix this thing.  Right.  They just, they just bash each other.  They blame each other.  Nothing gets done.  And then they decide to take the Jewish holidays off and not reconvene to fix this thing until 
[00:16:00]  Thursday.  Oh, the babbling heads last night.  Some people call them the talking heads.  I like to call them the babbling heads.  I like to call them the queer heads.  There's that word again.  They were yelling and screaming last night on all the news networks.  How dare they, you know, they work Christmas and, and, and new year's if they have to get  them back in there now.  They can't take off for the Jewish holidays.  Get back in there.  Turn those machines on.  Sell Mortimer. 
[00:16:30]  We're losing everything.  Get back in there.  Once it fell.  Probably by the accountants and everybody else in the business, a lot, a lot of, uh, Jewish  people have taken off.  Well, that's quite the stereotype.  Yes.  But I want to create my business manager.  She said, I'll talk to you next week.  Thanks.  The whole farm is sinking.  Yeah.  Enjoy yourself.  Have fun.  Yeah.  This is kind of a, this is a biggie though.  They, they, they got to blow off the Jewish holiday and then get back to work down there 
[00:17:00]  in Washington and get to work, but they can't, this is a prime example of a huge problem  that they, they really ought to try to hammer something out and, and cooperate on.  Uh, and if they can't figure this out, do you think they're figuring out little things,  you know, little things that might help out, uh, the country on the long, over the long  haul?  No, I don't know what they're doing, uh, in Washington anymore.  I have no clue what's going on.  I used to kind of have an idea.  I wasn't really into politics, but you'd watch the news and you'd kind of go, all right, 
[00:17:30]  this bill got passed or something happened here.  Nothing gets done anymore because they just are on opposition.  It's not the American government anymore.  It's two factions fighting to control the American government.  Absolutely.  One of our biggest problems is they just don't work together.  They don't.  It's just amazing.  It's a goddamn disgrace.  All right, let's, uh, head toward our first break.  We got a busy, busy show as, uh, as the, uh, world economy completely collapses in the 
[00:18:00]  next few days.  It's so cool watching the end of an empire and being part of it.  It's like, this is great, isn't it?  We're watching the crumbling of an empire.  It's wonderful.  I should bail them out though when you think about it.  Like, I don't want to lose money, but it's like, these companies are kind of scumbags.  They've done, they've, they've just kind of done this to themselves and to everybody else.  Like, I mean, I don't know if you can get the CEOs get the money that they get, but why  should they bail them?  There's a survival of the fittest kind of a thing going on.  If, if, if these CEOs and these companies have screwed up so bad that they're going 
[00:18:30]  broke, then they got to go and the void will be filled by somebody that perhaps can do a  better job.  If the demand is there for these companies, then someone will fill the void.  Someone will come in and fill the void just because some of these institutions, a hundred,  a hundred and somewhat years old, doesn't mean they're, uh, uh, infallible or immune to,  to collapse.  Yeah.  So why bail them out?  Yeah.  Let them go and then get some new blood in there, uh, with new companies that, uh, but 
[00:19:00]  the CEOs aren't so greedy and we have to bail them out because credit is, is frozen right  now and we got to get the money back up flowing.  See, I watched TV last night for five minutes.  I feel like an expert now.  Thank you.  Credit is frozen right now.  My friends.  Oh yeah.  And they had a, a nice little graph that showed a lot of arrows that went from wall street  and then a big, a big graphic that said you main street and how it affects you.  Oh, I did it.  It started up here and then it went to mortgage and then it went to, then it went to, uh, 
[00:19:30]  corporations and then it, then the arrow went left to, to salaries and then that arrow  went another left to you.  So everyone's affected because credit is frozen right now.  My friends.  Look at this.  Don't go big, big, you bitch.  She's, she's awful, but she's not the problem.  Even though she's, she is part of the, she is part of the, she is one of the most,  uh, uh, she's the one that just agitates this whole separatism between Republicans and  Democrats.  Divisive.  Divisive.  Yes.  She had the votes to pass the whole thing without any Republicans going and she screwed it. 
[00:20:00]  She had 60% of her party voted and if they, she'd gotten them all together, they could  have passed it without a single Republican.  So she got up there, something like 90 Democrats voted against it and a hundred because they're  up for election and she gets worried about getting thrown out.  She gets up there and starts her babbling speech, just lambasting everybody that's for  this thing.  And they go, okay.  I couldn't get past the fact that you used a, a big, a big boy word. 
[00:20:30]  What?  Divisive?  Yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah.  We're shock jocks.  Well, it's, it's a tad.  Dumb it down for the show, please.  All right.  I'll use queer words all day.  Nice.  You're queer.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  877-212-0-1-A.  Um, you want, you want to start a rumor today?  We haven't done this in a while.  Hmm.  Everyone's talking about Sarah Palin.  Why don't we, why don't we start the rumor?  She's, she's, uh, she's, she's dropping out.  Dropping out of the, uh.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Dude, constant hemorrhoid itch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we start that rumor?  It's not really a rumor because I heard it.  See?  There you go.  I heard, uh, people talking, so.  There you go.  It's not really a rumor at all.  She's dropping out because of nude photos that are surfacing.  Yes.  For the people listening right now, we are, don't even, we won't even acknowledge that.  We just said that we're starting this rumor, so you can help us out.  Spread the word out there.  Sarah Palin is dropping out of the presidential race.  Sex photos of her and Jim Brown. 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  That'll get middle America.  Let's get the rumor started.  Might as well have some fun as the empire collapses.  Yeah.  It's, uh, Opie and Anthony, lots to do, but first we, uh, we do a little P-T-G.  We're back, and the primetime gossip mills are going bananas.  Recently on the O&A show, Opie made an enormous announcement that soon, one of the show's cast members would be gone.  Someone very, very, very important to this radio show is leaving. 
[00:22:00]  It's not myself.  It's not Anthony.  It's not Jimmy.  But someone that is very, very important to this radio show is leaving.  Opie left it there, and the listeners went wild, leading to much speculation as to exactly who was leaving.  However, primetime gossip was able to get some audio that may help clear up this situation.  Stunned brains.  Stunned brains.  Stunned brains.  I was considering it, and then E-Rock and Danny both took the spoon and stuck it back in. 
[00:22:30]  That's right.  The Google-using mental midget wouldn't even have a scoop of ice cream with his coworkers.  Here's the spoon.  No, it's already been violated.  See, I knew you weren't one of us.  You're not one of us.  It's been violated.  You're not one of us.  Oh!  The evidence became clear.  Mr. I Love Politics more than the O&A show himself, Stunt Brain, is obviously not a true member of the Opie and Anthony family.  When are you going to be part of the team officially?  When are you going to, like, make everyone feel like you're part of this? 
[00:23:00]  What do we have to do?  Well, right there, that was it.  The stuntster was high on the totem pole when he first came to the show,  but after blowing his chance to prove his loyalty,  old Contribute Nothing Stunt Brain may justifiably be on his way out the door.  We'll keep you informed as this story unfolds only on Primetime Gossip.  There we go.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got a busy one. 
[00:23:30]  This song goes out to Wall Street today, let me tell you.  Welcome to the jungle, everybody.  We got Rich Voss coming in today.  I think he's getting every single tooth pulled out of his head tomorrow, I think.  This is amazing.  Yeah.  Voss is getting his teeth pulled out and getting, like, implants put in.  Not, you know, breast implants.  Of course, teeth implants. 
[00:24:00]  But I guess he's getting every tooth removed, not just, like, maybe the front.  Every single one's coming out.  He's had his teeth.  Why didn't he do that 20, 35 years ago when he started this process?  We'll find out.  He wanted to come in here without his teeth.  Really?  But I think because of scheduling, that's not happening.  Unless he's going to surprise us.  Knowing Voss, he could surprise us and come in here with no teeth in his mouth whatsoever.  What are they going to use him for?  The first floor of the Freedom Tower?  The cornerstone? 
[00:24:30]  Also, Colin Quinn is awake, and he is stopping by to yell and scream at us and do some fine radio as well.  Colin and Voss in studio, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, geez.  And the big news, if you're just waking up, Sarah Palin is dropping out of the presidential race.  Yeah.  More to come later on this morning.  Saw that coming.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Now, Anthony is on to something. 
[00:25:00]  We were talking about the media, and we're so sick of the media using the same crap over and over again.  What's the big one about McCain and the heartbeat thing again?  Oh, yes.  We can't have Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency.  Right.  Right.  Everyone is saying that, right?  They said every reporter, every news channel, you could hear that whenever they mention her name. 
[00:25:30]  Absolutely.  Well, you also mentioned, and I didn't pick up on this one, so bravo to Anthony.  This whole economic crisis that's going on, they're saying what?  How will Wall Street impact Main Street?  See, they're trying to say how the market affects the average Joe.  Right.  So their whole catchphrase with that is Wall Street and Main Street.  Right.  And they think they're so clever when they say it, but everyone's saying it that it's so annoying when I hear it now. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Well, here's a montage of that very thing.  There's no question that the troubles on Wall Street have absolutely bled into Main Street.  To make sure that Main Street is getting the same kind of help that Wall Street's getting.  Well, bad news from Wall Street has folks on Main Street in a panic.  What does it mean for Wall Street?  What does it mean for the rest of us maybe on Main Street?  Main Street is looking for accountability from Wall Street.  And that, of course, impacts both Wall Street as well as Main Street. 
[00:26:30]  And we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street.  Understand that this is just as much about Main Street as it is about Wall Street.  Wall Street is Main Street, folks.  I don't want to spend all this money to bail out these Wall Street fat cats.  It's also bailing out Main Street.  We get it.  Can you believe that there's still people saying this?  We get it.  In the end, it affects me.  It's just, after a while, these things become like saying groovy. 
[00:27:00]  It's just not, it's not cool.  He didn't like, like the first time I heard that, I was like, all right, I get it.  Wall Street, Main Street, that's kind of a good tie-in way to put it.  Sure.  But then everybody uses it.  Well, because of this crisis, Obama is surging in the polls.  Big time.  And some of those key states, he's making some major, major ground up.  Yeah.  Florida, Ohio.  Well, what's some of those other states that are on the fence? 
[00:27:30]  Michigan.  Colorado.  Colorado.  Florida.  Michigan.  Michigan.  Oh.  Pennsylvania.  Delaware.  They're saying we need some S to go down overseas for McCain to come back from this one.  They say if it's all about the economy, Obama is a, assure it, but.  That's, that's what happened with Clinton, if you remember.  It's the economy, stupid. 
[00:28:00]  Remember he would say that?  Did he actually say it's the economy, stupid?  Well, yeah.  That was like his battle cry.  It's the economy, stupid?  Yeah.  It's the economy, stupid.  And that's what got him in because the economy was so bad.  George W. was looking, not George W.  George H.  George H.  He was looking like, he was looking like he was a shoo-in.  He was, he was, he was going to win.  He wasn't even trying.  He didn't need to.  Didn't need to.  After that Gulf War thing, part one.  Who's this nobody from Arkansas?  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  And then, uh, the economy took a crap.  And then.  And he.  Hello, Clinton.  He was talking about, and wow.  He ran a terrible campaign, too.  They said he still could have won, but he was just, it was a harmless campaign.  Because no one, no one thought Clinton had a chance back then.  And Perot did hurt him, 17%.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  But Anthony's, uh, counting on middle America, and we got an example of middle America.  This is, this is Anthony's last hope right here.  This is my dream come true right here, is this, uh, hoping there's, uh, more people like  this fine woman.  Well, we got a southern woman talking about Obama. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  And this is Anthony's hope right here.  Now, when you hear all the, uh, people, the talking, uh, queers on, um, uh, the news  agencies, when you hear them talking, or you, maybe you live in a big city, and you talk  politics.  Can you ring the bell every time the word queer is used today?  Yes.  And you're talking politics maybe in a real city.  Uh-huh.  Uh, you get a much more diverse, um, uh, group of people.  Yeah.  To pick and choose from.  Uh, so you're not really getting a good, good look at America on the whole. 
[00:29:30]  This is America, what you're going to hear.  Yeah.  This is what I'm hoping for.  Well, we, uh, this is what I want in every voting booth in the country.  And we'll get this video up on onaradio.com if it's not there already.  Here is a southern woman talking about Obama.  When we're at war with the Arabs, we do not need a damn Arab president.  When you don't.  It's, it's, it's granny in the car. 
[00:30:00]  Jed.  We don't need no Arabs in the presidency.  I'm looking at the.  Jed.  I'm looking at the video.  This woman is not even 40.  On the road for president, Uncle Jed.  Yeah.  Like, this is granny.  Granny Clamford.  I guess you don't get CNN or Fox down there, huh?  Well, Jethro wants to be president.  It's been proven that he's not an Arab.  An Arab.  An Arab.  Let's go back. 
[00:30:30]  Fantastic.  When we're at war with the Arabs, we do not need a damn Arab president.  When you go over there to them Arab countries, they are cutting off the heads of the soldiers of our Americans.  And his middle name is Hussein.  And we want to, we want to vote for somebody with a name like Barack Hussein Obama.  Why don't we just vote for, we want to vote for somebody with a name like Barack Hussein Obama. 
[00:31:00]  Well, why are we electing an Arab when we're at war with Iraq and Iran?  I'm John McCain, and I approve of this message.  Yeehaw!  Why would we get an Arab president in there?  I want to call up Mr. Drysdale and tell him to send all the money to the McCain campaign, Uncle Jed. 
[00:31:30]  Well, that's a lot of money, Granny.  I don't care.  We can't have an Arab in there.  I want to run for president, Uncle Jed.  I'll have Ellie Mae come in as my vice president.  She's smarter than that other one that got in there.  I think she'll get the vote by just sitting there and petting her critters.  Jed!  We can't have no Arabs or none of them. 
[00:32:00]  I don't even, you know, even if he is an Arab, he's still a, Uncle Jed.  Uh, is that her?  Is that the, uh?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the one to the right.  The video's great.  She's on a lawnmower.  Of course she is.  We got more audio of her.  It's their transportation.  And look, the guy driving the lawnmower has no teeth.  No, that's what Rich Voss is going to look like later on.  This, this is my only hope right here. 
[00:32:30]  I'm placing my hopes and dreams in this woman's hands.  Hell, yeah.  And then, um, she continues.  Barack Hussein Obama.  Obama.  Now, we're going to have that for president.  That's what they said.  Hopefully not.  You better watch.  He's on the side, too.  You better remember the meeting.  Yeah, he likes him.  No.  Black ain't got nothing.  Watch her say. 
[00:33:00]  She likes him.  Black has nothing to do with the way the Arabs are trying to speak.  Certainly not, Carly.  This guy in.  Black ain't got nothing to do with the way the Arabs are trying to sneak this guy into  our country.  This is butterick.  Hussein Obama.  They are trying to win the war, and they are not going to do it.  You know what I said?  America is going to win.  Oh, man.  These colors don't run. 
[00:33:30]  Hillary Clinton for president all the way.  Yay!  Red, white, and blue.  These colors don't run.  And then she says Hillary Clinton for president.  Oh, then she loses everybody at the end.  She is a mess.  Why is the guy hiding his face in the video?  Besides, that was the obvious reason.  Oh, maybe he's the only one with a tad of sense.  Could it be?  I don't want to.  He's probably, like, wanted for something.  Yeah, he's probably wanted for kiddie porn.  I'm her husband, and I'm embarrassed as all hell is what the problem is. 
[00:34:00]  I love the guy with no teeth driving the mower.  Oh, yeah.  This video is classic.  That's middle America, though.  Right there.  Right there is what you're looking at.  It's a little.  You think.  Dude, you can't tell me that that isn't a huge portion of this country.  I think it's like ground zero of middle America.  I think it kind of spreads out from there and gets a little more sane.  Do you think?  I don't think.  I'm just saying a little.  I don't know.  That's the epicenter of middle America. 
[00:34:30]  Epicenter, yeah.  You know, that's the bullseye.  Why don't you go out to the cement pond and think it over there, Jethro?  I think I will, Uncle Jed.  I'm going to be president.  That's what I'm going to do.  Well, I'm glad to see you got an interest in something there, Jethro.  Jed, we can't have the Arabs taking over, Jed.  Calm down, Granny. 
[00:35:00]  Drink some of your tonic.  That's it.  Middle America.  That's my hope right there.  She's my ace in the hole.  Yeah.  Well, big news today.  Sarah Palin dropping out of the race.  We're going to find out more later this morning.  But this sure didn't help her cause lots of faux pas in the last few days.  Oh, yeah.  And have you heard the Charlie Gibson one yet? 
[00:35:30]  No, I just heard of the one yesterday.  The Katie Couric one was very good, but this Charlie Gibson one is just as wonderful.  Oh.  Why are they just picking everything she says and just boof?  Well, yeah, she may run the country.  I know.  That's what I mean.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  She's adult.  She really is not a smart woman.  Charlie Gibson asked Palin about the Bush Doctrine.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Asked what it is.  She tries to answer without revealing.  She's clueless.  Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?  In what respect, Charlie?  She tried to throw it right back in his face.  In what respect, Charlie?  And by that, I mean I have no idea what you're talking about.  We're listening to Spelling Bee audio.  Can you use that word in a sentence?  Yeah.  Origin.  Origin.  Right.  Right.  Definition.  Definition.  Definition. 
[00:36:30]  Charlie, I'm going to pass.  I'm going to pass to my opponent.  He's not here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Ooh.  This is a – yeah.  This is – she doesn't know what she's talking about.  Actually, this just goes to show you how easy it must be to run Alaska.  It's got to be so easy to run Alaska because she's – she's a dummy.  Yeah.  Who did she beat?  Yeah.  What was his platform?  A freaking walrus.  The actual walrus was running. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, my opponent, I don't agree with that.  His whole platform was more blubber for everyone.  Yes.  Blubber.  Right.  A blubber in every pot.  Right.  They had enough of blubber.  Right.  We just want to move into the 21st century.  Look, we're all about the blubber.  Sure, but please.  I'm a hacky mom.  The rest of the states are laughing at us, so we can't go for the more blubber for everyone  guy.  This actually – thank you for the correction.  The Gibson interview was before the Katie Couric.  Ooh. 
[00:37:30]  Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?  In what respect, Charlie?  The Bush – what do you interpret it to be?  His worldview.  Well, the Bush Doctrine, initiated September 2002, before the Iraq War.  I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this world of Islamic extremism,  terrorists who are hell-bent on destroying our nation.  There have been blunders along the way, though. 
[00:38:00]  There have been mistakes made.  And with new leadership – and that's the beauty of American elections, of course, and democracy  is with new leadership comes opportunity to do things better.  She stinks.  That was an explanation of what she thinks of the Bush Doctrine.  Yeah.  Doctrine.  Is the Bush Doctrine – I've heard, like, people said that there never really technically  was one, but then there was.  Is there one?  It is a vague-ass question.  Foreign policy.  That is a tough question, because, you know, who gives a crap? 
[00:38:30]  But, you know, she should probably know those things.  Maybe we should brief her a little more on the – give her flashcards.  Yeah.  I think he asked her that just because he knew she wouldn't know.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he's like, you know, because you –  It went one way, Charlie.  He's like, oh, well.  Here's part two.  Explain it, dummy.  That's what he wanted to say.  Explain it, stupid.  Well, here's part two where Gibson has to explain it to her.  The Bush Doctrine, as I understand it, is that we have the right of anticipatory self-defense. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  That we have the right to a preemptive strike against any other country that we think is  going to attack us.  Do you agree with that?  Charlie, if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against  American people, we have every right to defend our country.  Duh.  That's not –  That anyone would agree.  The most liberal-minded douche would agree that if there's an imminent attack and intelligence  tells you so, that you would do some kind of preemptive strike. 
[00:39:30]  She answers questions like she's on a job interview.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like –  No, it's like who brought it up yesterday?  Like she was – like she's answering one of those beauty pageant questions.  Right.  And she has no – like all those beauty pageant idiots have no idea what they're talking about  because it's the one unrehearsed thing that they have to do.  Right, right, right.  The questions we are giving you now are written from the judges, the judges panel.  What do you believe is the most important thing in the country, facing the country today? 
[00:40:00]  They don't know what the hell they're talking about.  Yeah.  And that's what she's like every time she's asked a question.  Let's say hi to Ron in Michigan.  Ron?  Eat it, Rain.  Hello.  What's up, Ron?  I just wondered if you played that Bobby Lee audio you forgot to play yesterday.  We didn't forget.  We decided it was more of a visual there.  I would encourage you, if you want to go a little deeper with the O.P. and Anthony show, 
[00:40:30]  we were discussing this yesterday, but it's more of a visual.  Bobby Lee on MADtv.  MADtv, a horrific show.  Even Bobby Lee admitted that, by the way, when he was on our show.  But he's playing John McCain, and it's pretty damn funny.  Yeah, it is a good one.  But it's more of a visual than good audio, I guess.  So check it out on YouTube.  It's everywhere.  Did we link it yesterday?  The Bobby Lee is John McCain thing?  I think we did.  All right, whatever. 
[00:41:00]  It might be on onaradio.com.  All right, we got Rich Voss here.  We got Colin Quinn, I believe, is here as well.  Right.  And on the way, the heartbeat away montage.  We gave you the Wall Street Main Street montage.  After the break, the heartbeat away montage.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Lots going on today.  In studio, Colin Quinn, who called us up and said, hey, I want to come in here. 
[00:41:30]  And we're happy to have you, Colin.  Also, Rich Voss to my right here.  We're happy to have you, too, Rich.  I want to start off by saying that.  By the end of the show, I don't know if we're going to be happy that you're here.  But we'll start off on the right foot.  Just to show what the world's worst, the dumbest Jew.  I have friends with Bob Levy, too.  And I still say Voss is number one.  Yeah.  Last night we saw him at the cell, he goes, to me, what's happening with this crisis?  Who ever heard of a Jew asking a Catholic what's happening with the financial? 
[00:42:00]  And it's Rosh Hashanah.  He's not anywhere near like the family.  Why are you talking with food in your mouth?  Didn't they teach you in Fit Club that you're supposed to talk without food in your mouth, you idiot?  All right.  When you were on the scale and Ant was looking at you saying, listen, don't talk with food in your mouth.  All right.  Novelty act.  I don't know what's going on.  Why is he a novelty act?  He is.  He's like he just fell in that category of screech and all those type of people.  I mean, five years ago, he was Colin Quinn. 
[00:42:30]  Now he's that guy from Tough Crowd.  You know what I mean?  But I don't know.  Why is that a novelty act?  It doesn't really explain this.  I'm not sure what the novelty act part is.  I'm not saying he's not finished, but I don't understand what the novelty act is.  Exactly.  That's right.  You went over your head.  You started too early.  You should just let me finish.  I was half bombing.  And now you're totally bombing.  All people forgot that I was bombing.  I thought you shut your orange spray on face.  I thought you were done because you swallowed.  I didn't know.  Why is your shirt the same color as your skin right now?  I want the people. 
[00:43:00]  The techniques of DJ AM.  I want the people to play along at home.  Rich Voss is brilliant for the first 20 seconds.  When it gets to 25 or 30, just listen closely.  The wheels fall off.  I was arguing with my dad last night over this whole financial crisis.  Yeah.  And I'm asking Anthony, because he would know about this, are the Republicans totally to blame  for lifting all the regulations on the housing market?  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  Totally.  You're saying?  Totally and completely, yeah.  Okay, so here's what it is.  No, I'm not saying that.  When it came to stupidity, but when it came to moral issues, the Democrats and the Republicans  completely are at blame.  Oh, God, why are you trying to be smart?  It's early.  The one good quality we have is being funny.  And you're trying to be smart.  I'm an idiot.  They're actually going to have some kind of indictments now they're going to try to get  against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the scummy mortgage companies.  For their names or for what they did? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, really.  That's the worst name ever, Fannie Mae.  Yeah, that sounds like two acts on a Def Jam special.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Give it up, y'all, for Freddie Mac.  Yeah.  This night people would be crazy.  Yeah.  With the news coming out today, this doesn't matter anymore, but we do have a montage of  the heartbeat away from the presidency.  We just did our Main Street, Wall Street, Wall Street, Main Street montage, which they 
[00:44:30]  can't get enough of saying.  Did you hear the Wall Street, Main Street thing?  No, but I like that expression.  I think it pretty much hits it on the head.  I bet you.  Doesn't it?  It's not used enough on the news.  I bet you they all thought they had something with this Wall Street, Main Street thing.  How about this pompous white trash, Pat Chog, going, that's Middle America for you.  There's more toothless people where he's from.  Pat Chog, he says.  He always picks some other Long Island crap hole that I'm from. 
[00:45:00]  I'm from Northport, my friend.  The tiny hamlet of Northport.  I'm from Northport.  I'm from Northport.  Yeah, that lady doesn't represent Middle America.  Maybe the epicenter, but it spreads out from there.  It absolutely is Middle America.  This center reach, son of a bitch.  Center reach.  He's naming every crap hole on Long Island that I've never lived in.  He's not from Northport. 
[00:45:30]  Can you bring Boston to the party?  What town would Anthony be from if he was in Massachusetts?  The Massachusetts area.  No, no, Boston's from Jersey.  No, I said, oh, Boston.  Yeah.  Because you go after Anthony being from Pat Chog, Center reach, Mastic.  Well, what about where I really was from when I lived up there?  Everett, Everett, Massachusetts.  I lived in Ashland.  Yeah.  By Framingham.  Yeah.  Still my favorite is when he went out to the West Coast.  What's his name?  Jackson.  Jimmy Jackson.  Oh, I love him.  Jimmy Jackson.  You promised us another Jimmy Jackson story when Colin came in. 
[00:46:00]  I know.  I'm going to have to really go through some old pictures or something.  You know what's sad downstairs when I signed in just now?  My name, their name right ahead of me.  Not ritual.  It's his voice.  He's still trying to sell it even to the guys at the security desk.  Just one name like that?  He's a one-name guy.  One-name guy.  Voss.  Because Colin didn't hear it.  Here's the Wall Street, Main Street montage the boys put together.  Because it's the catchphrase of the day there.  Everyone thought they were clever coming up with this one.  There's no question that the troubles on Wall Street have absolutely bled into Main Street. 
[00:46:30]  To make sure that Main Street is getting the same kind of help that Wall Street's getting.  The bad news from Wall Street has folks on Main Street in a panic.  What does it mean for Wall Street?  What does it mean for the rest of us maybe on Main Street?  Main Street is looking for accountability from Wall Street.  And that, of course, impacts both Wall Street as well as Main Street.  And we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street.  Understand that this is just as much about Main Street as it is about Wall Street. 
[00:47:00]  Wall Street is Main Street, folks.  I don't want to spend all this money to bail out these Wall Street fat cats.  It's also bailing out Main Street.  Wall Street, Main Street.  There it is.  Oh, right.  And now we're...  One guy, like, used it and it was probably clever.  Like, oh, I understand.  You know, it's the financial guys and the average Joe on the street.  And then they all just pounce on it and overuse it.  I'm surprised Obama didn't slip instead of saying Main Street, say Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[00:47:30]  Pretty funny.  MLK.  Very nice.  Well, this one doesn't matter anymore.  But then they did the heartbeat away from the presidency thing.  Here's the montage.  If John McCain wins, this woman will be one 72-year-old's heartbeat away from being president of the United States.  they're both trying to be a heartbeat away from the presidency the heartbeat away from the  presidency the heartbeat away from the presidency the heartbeat away from the presidency the heartbeat 
[00:48:00]  away from the presidency a 72 year old heartbeat away from the presidency of the united states of  america to be a heartbeat away from the presidency oh god and biden is a scope away from the  President Steve.  What are you insane?  Wow.  What?  Oh, Rich Voss.  We just got to acknowledge that you got a little saucy there, Rich.  That was a good one. 
[00:48:30]  How come I...  Enjoy the visit from the Secret Service.  How come I...  Yeah, no kidding, man.  We had nothing to do with that one.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton had nothing to do.  Don't get your teeth pulled.  They'll knock them out for you.  Yeah.  Just wait for the senator.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Voss would be a terrible assassin because the sun would glint off those shiny teeth  in the top of that building.  Hey, Colin, you were discussing the Sarah Palin thing with Rich Voss before you guys got  in here?  Yeah.  What do you think there, Rich?  I think it's smart, but...  He said, she's dropping out of the race. 
[00:49:00]  I said, where do you hear that from?  He said, you guys.  And I'm going, that's where you get your news from?  Yeah.  She's not dropping out of the race.  I heard it on Yahoo first and I heard these guys.  You heard it or read Yahoo?  I read it this morning, but...  It's not happening.  She's debating Thursday night and then she's going to Hilarity to see me work in Cleveland.  What's that?  Thursday night.  They're bringing in that guy, Tim Pauley, whatever his name is.  From Minnesota.  Paletti.  Yeah.  Governor of Minnesota.  That's a mistake, too.  They should go with Rudy.  There you go.  No one want to vote for Rudy.  Yeah, maybe. 
[00:49:30]  First of all, he knows if she dropped out of the race, it would just destroy his campaign  right now.  Not any worse than...  She's returning.  No, no, no, no.  She's dropping out on her own.  He's not telling her to step down.  That's the key to this whole thing.  The Democrats are going to say he can't even make a vice president decision on who to  pick up.  Or vice presidential.  Decision, yes.  Presidential, whatever.  No, I wouldn't say he can't make a vice president decision.  Vice presidential.  Okay.  I'm not going to...  You know what?  Add on all the extra syllables.  Whatever.  Yeah, fancy. 
[00:50:00]  You have time for that.  Yeah, who needs syllables, right, Rich?  Yeah.  But she's not dropping out.  You think so?  Yeah, I know she is.  She should.  Ask this clown.  He's the political guy.  He reads the stupid Wall Street Journal.  He's a stunt brain.  He reads the Wall Street Journal every day.  Yep, every single day.  And who they're saying?  Most crowd.  Tim Pawlenty, the governor of Minnesota, is the number one guy who should have been there  in the first place had it not been Romney.  Yeah.  Why is it not Romney, being that he's complete, you know, he's so conservative, and McCain 
[00:50:30]  is liberal conservative.  Why are they not, you know, the balance here?  One five-minute conversation last night, you're really spouting it out.  This reminds me of when we did Tough Crowd and Norton would try to be smart  and, like, for, like, three weeks in a row, he came in with, like, all the facts and everyone  was annoyed.  But at least Norton's inherently smart.  He's not educated.  What's a liberal conservative, though?  Well, who's not completely to the right or conservative on his issues when it comes to...  Liberal conservative?  Yeah.  Did you mean to say a liberal Republican?  That's what I meant.  Liberal Republican.  No, he meant the president type. 
[00:51:00]  What is a liberal conservative?  Every issue, he's not completely following the conservative party.  When it comes to immigration, he believes that it should happen, or we should let the  immigrants in, which is not a conservative view.  We should let every immigrant in?  Is that what he's saying?  Not all of them, but he's saying that we should open the borders.  I think we should go back to the old 80s radio where you'd have a comedian come in and  set up his bits, because you're really bumming us out.  Hey, Rich, I heard you have a gambling... 
[00:51:30]  I wish Byron Allen was here.  Rich, you have a gambling problem.  Hey, Jim, you like sex.  Hey, I heard there's elections coming up.  No matter what it is.  If it was the 80s, the studio would be chasing you down the street in Buffalo.  Shut up, stupid.  The audience chasing you.  I got it, but what are you doing?  What?  The radio would be...  No, I said...  You could have just made a simple...  It didn't have to be specific to me.  You could have made a joke.  It was the 80s.  You'd actually be popular.  The 80s...  Because I know I think you're still popular, and I think you're great, so I'm not going  to attack you. 
[00:52:00]  Boom.  You're in my top 100 favorite comics.  At number 56?  Wow.  You are great, and you don't let clubs determine whether you're good or bad.  Just because Levy's booking you now in firehouses doesn't mean...  If you look at a heart monitor, the line goes up and down when it goes straight across  your deck.  You're right.  So your career, it goes up and down.  You're a little down now, but you're going to come back because you're Colin Quinn.  You're going to change his name to Dow Quinn.  That's true.  It ties it in.  I tied that in.  You tied that in. 
[00:52:30]  That was a good one, Voss.  You're great.  Don't be hating on him.  Who?  I'm your...  I knew it, and I mean...  Every time I'm on the radio, I always bring up your name.  What?  Oh, he always says that.  It's really uncomfortable.  I know.  Because it's just the idea of him sitting in some faraway place, bringing up my name  because there's a lull in, you know, Pedro and Man Boobs or whatever morning show he's  doing.  And then he's sitting there and he comes back and he's like, he's doing me a favor for mentioning  me in Tulsa on the 6 a.m. like soccer mom station. 
[00:53:00]  Leave me out of it.  Die by yourself.  I mean, me and Bonnie were just discussing Colin Quinn, right, Bonnie?  That's right, hon.  And I mean...  George Gracie Allen, only he's Gracie.  Let's say hi to Charlie.  Charlie, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Jay Moore has completely ruined Colin.  Every time I hear Colin's voice, all I can think about is him doing Reservoir Dogs.  I know. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, that was a good one.  We have that.  We can play that one more time.  And I don't like the fact that everybody's now doing Jay doing me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Bobby did it the other day.  Norton did it the other day.  Anthony does it now.  That's pretty much what everybody does.  Same you I've always done.  You've never did it like that.  Of course I have.  What do you think?  You started mumbling recently?  Of course I have.  No, I've heard you do me.  You go, here he is.  I'm sorry to do.  You do me from remote control because when you were little, you used to stay home and watch it.  I never saw remote control.  When you were little.  When you were little.  When you were little the first time, you'd stay home and watch it. 
[00:54:00]  No, that's not true.  Well, you know.  I've always done it.  That's Jay Moore.  That's not.  I don't say anything.  I just, I'll just go, well, you know.  I don't.  That's it.  I don't.  Jay gets your personality down where he'll.  Personality.  You mean you're better about.  Personality.  Anthony's got it down too.  No.  I'm not putting it down.  No, not.  When he feels it, he'll do it a little later for you.  But he's got it down too.  I want Anthony to do dice as Bobby Kelly for voice.  That's my favorite.  Oh, yeah.  I did that one the other day. 
[00:54:30]  You did?  I don't know.  Here once again is Jay Moore doing Colin Quinn.  That's not her.  That's not her, you silly goose.  I'm so happy that that happened.  Pointing at the TV laughing.  That's not her.  It's Al Roker.  Hey, how'd you know what I was talking about?  Dee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  I'm going for the 12-year-old insult.  Yeah, yeah.  How'd you know who I meant? 
[00:55:00]  I'm looking at it on the TV.  If you don't like it.  I'm like Colin.  That's a girl.  Jay Moore doing Colin Quinn  Doing Reservoir Dogs  It's a quick minute here  Please put Colin in Reservoir Dogs  Guys, you know  Obviously there was a wretch  In this whole operation  And I'm no more than me  I'm pretty goddamn sure  I wasn't here  The guy definitely  F***ing freaked out in there  But he seems  I don't know  He seems pretty okay now  He's a big guy

[01:21:30]  Good evening  I love all the  Keith stuff  But everybody's  Got to be talking  About the two old  Ladies in Shrewsbury  Who won their court case  And now they  Can't cut down the tree  Really they can't  Cut it down  Nope they  Judge ruled in their favor  I hear they're also  Not getting evicted  This is a story  We've been following  For a while there Colin  Have you heard about  The old broads  Up there in Shrewsbury  No I have not  Where's the audio clip  We got an excuse  To play the audio clip  One more time  We spoke with this one  We got the update here 
[01:22:00]  Two elderly women  Who tied themselves  To a crab apple tree  To protest its removal  Have rescued the tree  And saved themselves  From eviction  Yay  This story has a good ending  Tappy  74 year old Leah  And 65 year old Pat  Spent several days  Tied to the tree  What about Ethel  Ethel is  She wasn't committed  She really wasn't committed  To tying herself  To the crab apple tree  They tied themselves  To the tree  For several days  There Colin  Challenging a decision 
[01:22:30]  By the Shrewsbury  Housing Authority  To cut it down  To relocate a trash bin  After their protest  They received eviction notices  On Monday  Let's see  Leah  And Pat  And a third woman  That must be Ethel  Ethel  Who was threatened  With eviction  For violating the complex's  Policy  By keeping a chair  On her porch  Met with blah blah blah  Their lawyer  Blah blah blah  Blah blah  They're not going to be evicted  That's  That's  But we talked  With one of these women  We did  Live on the air  Yeah  Well you're getting 
[01:23:00]  A big guess now  Huh  She was  She was wonderful  What a treat  Just full of life  She was a delight  Oh a delight  The old  The old hag  Yeah  And she's from England  Originally  But she moved here  And she has a unique  After the war  Yes after the war  It was after the war  She had talked about  The blitz  Yes  Revolutionary  She had talked about  All that stuff  And her accent  Makes her say a few things  Very differently  Than we do 
[01:23:30]  I can't believe  Colin hasn't heard this yet  Listen to this  Play it  I'll see if I heard this  As she describes  Their plight  And while safety  Is certainly  A big concern  For these ladies  They say  There's got to be  A better option  Than cutting down a tree  And I can't see  Why they can't  Fix the dumpster  Why they can't  Fix the pad  I mean  I'd like to know  Them to tell me  Why they can't  Fix the pad  All it is  Is a cement pad  I'm sure  If I was young  I could fix it  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:24:00]  Yeah  Hmm  If we comment on that  We'll be in trouble  But there you go  That's a unique way  Of saying  The word can't  I saw  She was on here  Last week  Right  Little Britain  Give me that  Give me that  Can I  Can I play  Didn't David Blaine  Tie himself to a tree  Wish he would  Through a noose  You shouldn't say 
[01:24:30]  That he's biracial  Oh that's true  I didn't even  Think of that  Although he's lighter  Skin than Voss  I want to apologize  To anyone  I might have offended  With that comment  I didn't mean  Anything but humor  Let's talk about  Let's talk about  Plant Sprayer  Tan Voss  I just pictured him  In his house  With a plant spray  He goes  Plant Sprayer  Tan  Barney  You missed the  Spinal section  Please  Just a little lower  It doesn't look even  Now they just lay him  Down naked  And run him  Feel like it's  In a Detroit  Auto 
[01:25:00]  Baker place  Oh god  Oh did you fall  Apart on that one  I had the visual  I wasn't very  Presidential  Another thing  That has to do  With an auto  Auto factory  I got a six year old  Mercedes  I tip a guy  A hundred dollars  What did you  Want to play  Well it's just  That it's on  The same CD  And it's one  Of our favorites  The Screaming  Tree People  Oh yeah

[01:26:30]  Threes I've seen  And tell them  That we love them  And that we don't  Want them to die  They get mad  When Floss  Chews them down  Here  What do you care  Sounds like a girl  Leaving Norton's apartment  So I want you to know  That dream  That we care  Norton's  Norton's girls  Leave  Like the hookers  In American Psycho  Remember that 
[01:27:00]  Look on their face  That look of disgust  He just hands the money  Grabbing the money  And then leaving  They have a horrified  Look on their face  Disheveled and beat up  Devoid of waste  I love that  Why they wear trannies  In American Psycho  Why add on  Why  You're like William Macy  In the cooler  Yeah  He cools things down  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I think we are 
[01:27:30]  Deeply hurting  In America  I think we are  Deeply craving  Answers  I think that we've  Lost our identity  As we have  Evolved into technology  And into  Industrialized society  Bring me to  This cathedral  Bring me to  Those guys  Bring me to  This rock  That has  The most  Incredible life  That makes me 
[01:28:00]  Feel alive  I've looked at  Clear cuts  And burnt  Forest  And I  Felt outraged  But I didn't  Scream  And I didn't  Cry  And I need to  That's somebody  I hate to be  Old fashioned  She needs a good  She needs a guy  In her life  Just pounding  Once in a while  That's just a  Scream of  Frustration  Or the tree  From the evil  Dead  Damn I didn't see it 
[01:28:30]  Oh the tree  Raped a woman  It did  Yeah it was a  Very evil tree  Let's go to Maine  Dean how are you  Marshall apple white  When you need him  With those people  They're perfect  Pickens for that guy  Dean  Just wanted to say  Voss's line was  Hilarious  I almost drove  Off the road  Linger longer  Wait which line  About the tree  Screaming and calling  Client  I think he's  Calling in jest  No he isn't 
[01:29:00]  No I don't think so  Tree screaming what  Goodbye  Thank you  Goodbye boy  Tree screaming what  When you were climbing  I don't even get it  He was implying  That you were really heavy  And that the tree  Would scream  That you were  Oh  Like that you were honest  Colin you're  You're confusing everyone  Now you've got your  Coat half on  You're staying  You're going  You want to  Jesus  What's his name  From Ragey Bull  What are you doing  Tommy I'm laying down  I'm sitting on  Colin's just being  Colin  I'm always like this  What's the big plug  And it is a big one 
[01:29:30]  Governor's Comedy Club  In Levertown Long Island  With my cousin  Tim Gage  And we don't  No  No kumias need  Apply  Because they're not  Getting tickets  We don't like the way  You pushed us around  As kids  I am  Showing up  I am going  My cousin  Has never been  Allowed near Northport  So I don't know  How your brother  Could have beat him up  We're from Northport  It takes real dirtbag  Long Island  To claim North  If you really had  Clash  You'd say  We're from  Cold Spring Harbor  But they won't even  Try that  So they're saying  Northport  Northport kind of  Covers the whole area 
[01:30:00]  Although I did live  In Central Iceland  For a while  Yes  C.I.  C.I.  Is it a dump?  Oh!  God damn  It's so bad  That's my favorite thing  I lived in the  Garden Apartments  There on Hawthorne Avenue  What a horrible  Horrible place  Yeah  It was like projects  But only your little kids  Living in them  Like getting beat up  It was like some kind  It was like that  Bugsy Malone movie  Yeah  Where it's like  Adults  Kids playing adults  That's what it was like  You're still getting beat up 
[01:30:30]  There's kids doing drugs  Shaking you down  I love it  Every time Anthony  Goes off  And you did promise me  A Jimmy Jackson story  How about a Jimmy Jackson story  After the break  Even if you go  I gotta remember a good one  Because I did tell the one  About when he built the chariot  Yeah  Ran it down to the main drag  Of San Juan Capistrano  And the horse ran between  Two parked cars  And the chariot didn't fit  He just decided to build a chariot  After the break  Yeah the dead horse story  I told him that Joe  After the break 
[01:31:00]  A Jimmy Jackson story  Even if it's one you're told  I'm sure you'll add a little bit  To the old story  Okay  Alright first  We got prime time  With a little gossip  We're back  And the rumors are flying  A mile a minute here  At PTG Central  We recently let you know  That Opie made a major announcement  A few days ago  On the ONA show  Someone very, very, very important  To this radio show  Is leaving  It's not myself 
[01:31:30]  It's not Anthony  It's not Jimmy  And while the conspiracy theories  Have been all over the place  We here at Primetime Gossip  Have found the audio  That uncovers exactly  Which effeminate producer  Is leaving the ONA show  Uh Travis wants to say  Something before we leave  What?  Travis wants to say  He has a big announcement  Oh god  I thought we were doing this  Next week  What was that Opie?  Oh god  I thought we were doing this  Next week  That's right  The proof is in the pudding  Thanks to Opie dropping hints  We now know 
[01:32:00]  That queer little Travis  Is the one  Who's leaving the show  Thanks for the memories Trav  Good luck making  Little to no impact  Somewhere else  Thanks  What did  Keep it locked  As PTG continues  To follow this developing story  We'll get into that a little later  Oh god  Opie and Anthony  On your radio dial  We got Rich Voss in the studio  Hilarity's Cleveland this weekend  Colin Quinn  Governors this weekend  Jim Norton  HBO this weekend  Friday night  Friday night after Bill Maher 
[01:32:30]  Speaking of Bill Maher  He's the star of the new movie  Religulous  Yep  And we had the director  Larry Charles in yesterday  And we were hoping to get this  Yesterday  We were hoping to get a little  A little back and forth  Going with Larry Charles  And Bill Donahue  But we couldn't get Bill  On the phone  I think Bill was hiding on us  Bill were you hiding on us yesterday  Actually it wasn't  I was seeing a doctor  Out in Long Island  I wish I could have been with you  Uh oh  There are people out there  Cheering  What  Big problem  No no no  Oh okay  Yeah of course 
[01:33:00]  Bill Donahue  The head of the Catholic League  And Larry Charles  You know  He's got this new movie  Coming out  And there's a lot of talk  About the movie  A lot of buzz  And we were hoping  To get you on the phone  To get some  Some yelling and screaming going  Yelling and screaming  With me  With Bill Donahue  Well yeah  Oh yeah  I don't see that once in a while  Have you seen the movie yet Bill  No but Susan Fonny  Our director of communications  Saw it last week  We were out there  With our Jewish friends  Protesting that bomb  From Iran  Medinajad  And she  Lacham 
[01:33:30]  Huh  I don't know  Someone was speaking  Some foreign language  I was speaking Farsi at you  Yeah  The Iranian madman  That SOB  Who came into New York  And these fools  Greeted him at a big dinner  I would have  Thrown up all over the place  And I'd see this guy  Don't you find it odd  He's treated like a rock star here  I don't know why  I mean  This guy is from hell  Why would you want to  Have dinner with the devil  Bill do you really think  That he's this dangerous  Or is he more of a guy  Who's trying to like  Just keep that  That radical contingency happy  You know 
[01:34:00]  Is he more just like  A loud spokesman  You know what  Let's not take the chance  This guy  We have now evidence  From ten different nations  Independently  That he is engaged  In uranium enrichment  That he is going forward  With the nuclear program  If that in fact  Is the case  Which has led to  Three sanctions  By the security council  Of the United Nations  We have to take him serious  I mean  Who wants to be called bluff  If this guy does act  At some point  And tries to destabilize  The world  And it's not like  He's just talking  About things  And he's so anti-semitic  He is  But Kim Jong-il 
[01:34:30]  Wanted attention  From the US  So he made those  Silly threats  And he wanted  Certain things  And it's almost like  If this guy wants  Certain things  In a relationship  With the West  That's the best way  To do it  Is to pipe up  Until we acknowledge it  And do it  We can't mess with  North Korea  You know that  Right  But North Korea  Is bad enough  But the situation  In the Middle East  Is a tinderbox  Which you could really  Draw us in big time  So I don't know  I just think  You've got to  Keep your guard up  And besides that  Our whole protest  Was about one thing  Why are people  Going to dinner  Honoring this man 
[01:35:00]  It's one thing  To have him  Into the UN  Which I don't even  Think he should be  In the UN  If he wants to  Knock out a sovereign  State  Namely Israel  But if you're  Going to have him  In the UN  Why do you have  To have a dinner  Honoring him  This is amazing  To me  Yeah I don't know  Why they really  People are just  Taken by this guy  I know you  Literally back  In the 80s  Damn good one  I just thought  About it for a minute  He looks like Ricky Roma  He's not  We're all queer  We're all queer  Get him around  But we kill our queers 
[01:35:30]  He's not bluffing  Israel already blew up  His first nuclear plant  He was building  Well I don't think  He was building it  At the time  Oh Jesus  Well Iran was  Iran  I told you  Yeah in 81  Exactly  And Voss just got  The news bill  Last week  That's why he's  Bringing it up  The show is  He's trying to  Update his game  When Voss was  Celebrating his  20th year in comedy  And apparently  The Shaw  Has come down  With something  So now Bill  This movie 
[01:36:00]  It kind of  Really takes a look  At religion  And doesn't present it  In a very  Nice way  Especially the  Catholic religion  I'm surprised  By their response  Actually  Yeah and I  Want to start by  Saying why didn't  You yourself  See the movie  You had one of  Your people  Go see it  And report back  To you  And then  You comment  About her report  Well as I said  I was at  An event  Where my friend  Beth Galinsky  A woman  International  And also runs  Jewish Action League  Long time friends  Of mine 
[01:36:30]  In the Jewish  Community  Asked me to  Represent Catholics  So to speak  At this event  And I thought  That was more  Important  It was a one time  Event  And I let  Susan go through  This horror show  Of listening to  Mar  Actually as it  Turned out  From what I got  From Susan  Is that  It wasn't as  Hateful  As I expected  See look  I have a  Kind of like  A Mel Brooks  Standard  When I look  At these comedies  I mean Mel Brooks  Made kind of  Innocent joking fun  Of almost every  Demographic group  In our society  He never singled  One out  And he never 
[01:37:00]  Did it in a  Vicious way  Below the belt  Bill Maher  Unfortunately  In the past  Has chosen  Just the Catholic  Church to demonize  And he's done it  In a vicious way  In this particular  Movie  I guess he has  One leg  Into the Mel Brooks  Camp  That is to say  That he doesn't  Single out  The Catholic Church  So that there's  Some relief there  However  And I have to say  We expected it  To be worse  In the sense  Of the vicious  Statements that  He's made  About priests  Or getting to  Core religious  Beliefs 
[01:37:30]  He kind of  Took a more  Of a theater  Of the absurd  Type of an  Approach  Which in other  Words our  Expectations  Were that it  Would be worse  Than what it  Was  Oh okay  Wow that's  Actually sounds  Like an endorsement  That'll be in  The papers  Yeah  Bill Donahue  Says we thought  It was going to  Be worse  You know what  I get a kick out of  He says for example  I mean he seems  To be a tortured  Soul bill  Because he comes  Out and he says  Well you know  Jesus didn't exist  Or and then he  Goes on citing  Jesus  Well what the hell  Is it 
[01:38:00]  He says that  For example  Jesus didn't  Preach against  Homosexuality  Well what difference  Would it make  If he's not  The son of god  And at one point  In the movie  He says in fact  He doesn't exist  Then how can you  Play this card  I mean some of the  Stuff that he was  Doing is quite  Irrational  He wants to  Call people  Of faith  Irrational  But bill  Let's be honest  This is  Colin Quinn  As you  You know  Who I am  Anyway  No  Anyway  That's good  By the way  You don't want to be on his radar  You know who I am  Did you watch TV 
[01:38:30]  In the mid to early 80s  When you had to get up  And change  Bill  Bill  Don't let them  Don't let them  You know as well as I do  Without seeing this movie  I guarantee  He does two minutes  On  On Islam  He does two minutes  On the  Celebrators of today  We got one in the studio  Rosh Hashanah  You know what I'm saying  And then he does  An hour and a half  On Catholics  Let's quit pretending  It's otherwise  Right  Well there's no question  He's got  He's got this fixation  On the Catholic church  It's not a fixation  On the Catholic church  Everybody tries to talk 
[01:39:00]  About other religions  When it comes to Islam  They're scared of  Danish cartoon riots  Well that's what really gets me  I mean you've had  People killed  Because of that  And you know  An inoffensive depiction  Of Mohammed  Leads to this incredible  Type of reaction  That's the same group  That world council of churches  Would host at  Ahmadinejad last week  They said yes  The cartoons were bad  And so was the violence  Well thanks a lot folks  They're not exactly identical  You have the cowardice  Of Random House  Not even to publish  A novel  About Mohammed  Because some radical Muslims  Wouldn't  I mean 
[01:39:30]  It's relativity  Yeah based on fear  The duplicity  Is absolutely astounding  On this thing  And you know  These guys  Parker and Stone  And you guys  Opie and Anthony  You guys have made reference  To this kind of stuff before  And you know  And I think that people  At least just own up  And say listen  There are certain groups  That are off limits  And it's because of fear  Bill why don't you own up  And admit you know who I am  Bill  It bugs me that an Irish guy 
[01:40:00]  From Long Island  Wouldn't know who I am  It bugs me  Why he's busy  Bill  I'm Colin Quinn  Bill this is Rich Voss  Do you know who I am  Rich Voss  It doesn't matter  Rich  When you said fear  Rich is on a  When you said fear  Did you see the horse whisperer  He was the star of it  Yeah  You might recognize  His teeth  If there were commandments  Chiseled into him  He's a toothy man Bill  Do you get it  Yeah  Bill  Bill  When you said fear  Let me tell you what fear means  False evidence appearing real 
[01:40:30]  You know that  It's called  It's called our friends Abdul  Who sharpen their machetes  And take your damn head off  If you offend them  That's what it's called  And it shouldn't have to come to that  Before some people  Like Bill Maher  And others  Slam the brakes  Well maybe the Catholics  Gotta get a little tougher  And start lopping some heads off  That's right  Like the Crusades  You're talking to Rich Voss  Do you understand  He claims to be Jewish  He's from a Jewish background  He has a tattoo  Which means you can't get buried  As a Jew  That says never again  And I'm not kidding  Yeah never again  It's quite the paradox 
[01:41:00]  It's the paradox  First of all you can be buried  Paradox of idiocy  That's crazy  They say you can't be buried  For defacing your body  If that's the case  No Jews would be in a cemetery  With all the facelifts  And those jobs  Okay  Jewish cemeteries  Would be like your audience  Empty  Okay Colin  Oh wow  Colin  I hope  Colin  You might know Colin  By the Gaza Strip  You might know Colin  By six angry Palestinians  Watch Bill go  Oh now I know who Colin is  The empty clubs  Colin  Oh lay off  I've been gone this weekend  You guys are ruining my gig  Colin worked the corner  During the Levy fight 
[01:41:30]  You might recognize him from that  Alright so you don't have  That big of a problem with this  It's not that big  By the way who hosted  The Ahmadinejad dinner  The B'nai B'rith  The Royal Council of Churches  The Mennonites  The Quakers  Out of the UN  Unbelievable  The American Service  Love their own stuff  Four liberal Christian groups  Hey Bill you were talking about  Catholicism  Going against science  What's your take on that whole thing?  Well I mean you know 
[01:42:00]  You take a look at the historians of science  And they've all credited  And most of these guys  Aren't even Catholic  They've credited the Catholic church  With pioneering the scientific revolution  And particularly with regard to  The pioneering efforts in astronomy  The idea because they get the band  Band rap because Galileo  Who sold his ideas  When he didn't have proof  As if it were  And one guy gets punished  And the next thing you know  The Catholic church is anti-science  I mean that's one of the  One of the black legends  Quite frankly  That comes out of the  Protestant Reformation  Which most people  Have gotten over by now  But I guess it works good 
[01:42:30]  For David Letterman or somebody  But Bill  I'd like to know  Where you stand on this too  Because this has come up  A lot recently  What about the dinosaurs?  A lot of people  Are starting to say  That man and dinosaurs  Shared the earth at some point  And science definitely  Says no  That's Colin  He was there  Well listen  Let me say  I believe that  You teach evolution  In the science classes  Alright  And what you do  In the social science classes  That you talk about 
[01:43:00]  There's a debate  In the country about it  So I  Listen  There's an academic in me  I spent 20 years teaching  16 as a college professor  And I don't  I break with the religious  Right on this  Keep science  In the science classes  And then if you want to  Discuss the controversy  That goes on  Certainly by all means  But do that in a  Social studies class  Interesting  And what about  Some of these  Really old religions  That have the same story  Of Jesus  That was brought up  In the film  But only some other 
[01:43:30]  You know  Guy  It's pretty much  The same story  Of death  The same story  It's almost  The exact same story  I don't have the  You know  I don't know  Of any historical evidence  Which would indicate  That there's anyone  Who could resemble Christ  In terms of the  Documented evidence  That we have  Of the time  I mean  You've got people  Like Aristotle  Long before Christ  We're all studying  His works in the schools  Quite frankly  Surely  There's always been  Some people  There's a guy right now 
[01:44:00]  There's a Latino guy  Who's half out of his rock  Who claims to be  Jesus Christ  So you've always  Had these  He's in the film  He's in the film  This guy  He swears he's  Jesus  Really  He's making a fortune  Off it  Yeah I imagine  He probably is  Yeah I'm not going  I'm not going to  Confession to that guy  But does he swear  To himself  Thank you  Thank you  Were there any Jews  Involved in this dinner  For this Iranian  Yes as a matter of fact  There was a  Her name is  Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb  Ah  Yep  And I have it 
[01:44:30]  Right in front of me  Here at the Jerusalem  Post  In September 26  So yeah  I mean listen  There's a lot of dirt  To go around  On these kinds of things  Why anybody would  Embrace this bum  I don't know  I was on with  Matt Lauer  A year ago  When this guy  Came into the United Nations  And I said  He shouldn't be  Teaching at Columbia  Matt says  Don't you believe  In freedom of speech  I said yeah  That's what we have  Open forums for  You know  Madison Square Garden  The Beacon Theater  Central Park  A university  Is founded on  The pursuit of truth  If we haven't  Come to the conclusion 
[01:45:00]  That what this guy  Teaches  Is an out and out  Lie  Then we might as well  Close the university  So let him have his speech  If you have to have him  In the UN  Let him go there  But why do you have  To have a reception  For a man like this  Who if he had his druthers  He'd kill every Jew on earth  Well people like  Khalid Mohammed  Used to speak at colleges  Throughout the country  I know  You know  And he was the biggest  Hate monger on the planet  That's a different story  If you spoke out  About him  It wasn't about  What he was saying  It was about racism  For some reason 
[01:45:30]  And I was with my friend  Beth Galinsky  Of the same group  The Jewish Action Alliance  Who conducted  The Women International  She sounds more like  A Polack than a Jew to me  To be honest  Sounds like she had  A radio show  For like a minute here  And we were up in Harlem  Dealing with Khalid Mohammed  But it was anti-Catholic  Anti-gay  Anti-Jewish  Anti-just about everybody  Everything  He lived in Cliffside Park  New Jersey  Didn't he  In a really white neighborhood  In a white building  All Jews in his building  Yeah he did  He had to move  He was kicked out  Of the Nation of Islam  I mean you have to really hate  Which God  None of us know  What the Nation of Islam is 
[01:46:00]  Islam  Islam  Whatever  I have fake teeth  In right now  The words aren't  Going to come out perfectly  The dump filter is broken  I'm getting used  To my new teeth  Bill while you're  Hanging out with all those Jews  Could you find a good dentist  For our friend Rich Voss  I go to the 2nd Avenue Deli  Hey Bill who should we vote for  All the Catholics out there  Who should we vote for  I am so disgusted  With what I've been seeing lately  And with the elites  In this country  From Wall Street  To Main Street  It is 
[01:46:30]  Oh hey there's another one  Hold on hold on  Have you been listening  To the show this morning  All I know is that  I'm picking up the times  This morning  And Jim Cramer  Is on there with this guy  Steele from Wachovia  Here about a week ago  Saying everything is fine  And Cramer's saying  Bye bye bye Wachovia  And now he had to apologize  On TV  Oh my god  Oh my  Oh that hurts  I love it  Yeah Jim Cramer's  Yeah Wall Street to Main Street  That's  I've heard that too much  And not enough  With the Main Street Wall Street  What do you think of this  Sarah Palin 
[01:47:00]  Oh I like her  I'm not with George Will  And these other snobs  Out there  And David Brooks  And David Frum  Kathleen Parker  She doesn't know  What she's talking about  There's a lot of  There's a lot of jealousy there  Because she is out of Main Street  And people can identify with her  Now she's not the most  Experienced person on the block  Now there's Obama  For that matter  But if you've got  Good judgment and character  That can carry a long way  I'm excited about it  The bar is raised  Pretty low now  Actually for her  On Thursday  Because nobody expects  It to do too well  I suspect that  Against Joe the gaffe 
[01:47:30]  Biden  She'll do well  But Bill  Don't you think that  I mean  Do you really trust her  When she's a 72 year old  Heartbeat  Away from the White House  The old is cliche  She's not really  I mean I don't hate her  On principle  I've heard a couple  Of her interview answers  And she didn't seem  That impressive to me  On what she was talking  About with foreign policy  I think she's being  Over-programmed  I think these guys  Have got her  Into a crash course  In all these  One-on-one programs  And she's got to let  The woman go a little bit  So I'm anxious  To see what she does  On Thursday night 
[01:48:00]  But you know  Listen  She's a breath of fresh air  Compared to these other people  That we've seen  And how can we do much worse  All we have  It was the best  And the brightest  Wasn't it  All these guys  From Harvard and Yale  Who stacked Wall Street  And these are brilliant people  Henry Paulson  Down on his knee  What a fool  I mean  We're worried about  Sarah Palin  He makes a point  Unbelievable  All right  All right  Well thanks  Thanks Bill  For calling  Bill  Yes  Always a treat  When you know  You're not trying  To get us fired 
[01:48:30]  Bill I'll be  Governors in Leviton  This weekend  Yeah  Yeah you might want  To check out Colin  Hey Bill  I know you've been  Followed by career  For a long time  Do you have HBO Bill  Actually I don't  Oh you should get it  This Friday at midnight  Because I'm on  After Bill Maher's show  Really  We can tape it here  I can watch it  All right good  It's called  Down and Dirty  With Jim Norton  I have some very good  And if you have  Any friends in Cleveland  Rich Voss will be  Hilarities  Yes  And we'll be starting  Up the Tough Crowd Tour  With myself  Colin and Keith Robinson  No he said  I'll have the guys 
[01:49:00]  Tape it here for me  Hey Bill  What bar are you  Going to be drinking at today  The one I usually go to  Is McGeevers  Out in Long Island  There you go  Yeah  Yeah nice Irish pub  I can have a chalks  Over here by Penn Station  Sure  Yeah  Yeah that's a good place  Throw back a few  I hear you  There's nobody around  I mean all the Jews  Are off today  So I've got plenty of seats  Sure  That's true  Oh the Jews are in the bars  Please  They own it  Yeah  Hey Bill  Are the complaints  Down on us these days  On the what  Complaints  Not many complaints  Coming in  No 
[01:49:30]  I guess you guys  Are going to get  Absolutely zipped  All right we'll change that  Yeah we're trying  I'm afraid to say that  You guys will change that  Very quickly  I know  We're trying to be good  I'm trying to be good  All right there Mr. Donahue  All right Bill Donahue  Take care man  All right buddy  Thank you  Here goes Bill  Bill Donahue  Mortal enemies  At one point in our career  You know  When someone gets you fired  From a very lucrative job  For two years  Still not much of a fan  To be honest with you  I still don't blame him 
[01:50:00]  But whatever  Nah  He didn't fire us  If you were head of the Catholic League  You'd have probably done the same thing  Like I would never be head of the Catholic League  But if I was  I would absolutely have wanted us fired  You can't even give it to him  Yeah  You can't even coach though  Oh damn Jimmy  Slip that one in  Oh  Literally  A literal ant  No I honestly  I have to talk to him  He's a rational  Guy  The way he talks about  Like it's  It's a Catholic  As long as they're attacking everybody 
[01:50:30]  It's fine  I mean he's not  Some irrational religious leader  If you could excuse my language here for a minute  You might have to dump out  He does like to toot his own horn  Yeah  He was the spokesperson  When we got fired  And he didn't even hear the bit  You know  He had a lot to say  He doesn't hear or see anything  That's the point I'm making  Oh please  He's all over  If you had done that in a mosque  We'd all be dead  They would have blown up the door  Well yeah  I believe that  I have a problem with the fact that  He has his people do all his  You know  Yeah there's always  It's like did you see that Bill  Did you hear it  And they're like 
[01:51:00]  No but I had some secretary  Or an intern  I go did you hear what we did that day  He goes  No I didn't need to  I'm like well  I think at the very least  You should hear the bit  Before you're on CNN  And every other  FN news station  You're telling me the Hedric Catholic League  Should hear people having sex  And say Patrick  If you're going to be on TV  Talking about it  Ad nauseum  Yeah you should at least hear the bits  Because the fact of the matter was  You never really heard people having sex  You never heard anything  You just heard  Look we were in a tough spot  I understand that  Some juicy licked ass  Saying something stupid on the phone  But you know who did hear it  The lawyers that fired us 
[01:51:30]  Who approved it to begin with  They heard it  There you go  The lawyers  I hold more animosities with them  But he's doing the same thing  He's doing the same thing  With this religious  A lot of people want his comment on  And one of his spokespeople  Went and saw it  Oh please  How about the fact that  How about the amount of people  That didn't see  Passionate Christ  And ran Mel Gibson  Out of the business  I mean if you want to talk about that  I think you should see the stuff  That's all  I know  But he was honest about it  He was honest that his person saw it  Bill Maher  This is what the statement says though 
[01:52:00]  Catholic director of communications  Susan Fanny  Attended a preview of the Bill Maher movie  Religious in New York City  In a report to league president  Bill Donahue  It was clear that the film  Is more absurd than hateful  Here is Donahue's take on the movie  As informed by Fanny's observations  That's funny  It's like  Someone told him about it  And then he gets to comment  As if he saw it  I mean this is  This is like  This is his thing  He should like make time  To go see the movie  Right  Because you know a lot of people  Are going to be asking  For his opinion  That's all I'm saying 
[01:52:30]  That's true  We comment on everything  That we haven't seen  Or been involved in  Well this is true  You know  He's an important guy  He's ahead of the Catholic League  He can't go to everything  Who wants to go see Bill Maher  To begin with  All right  He's a little insufferable  You know  Bill Maher did a good job  At the film  He's insufferable  Good for him  He did a good job  Good for him  I still can't forgive him  He did a good job  Guy was a douche  To me personally  Who  Bill Maher  Oh  First time I was ever  On the radio  Bastard  I was a tin knocker 
[01:53:00]  And then I went into radio  And the goddamn guy  We were interviewing him  And he started goofing on us  For the fact that  We didn't know how to interview  We were a bit green at that  We were very green  Yeah  Wasn't last week  Or recently  All right  That's pretty good  All right  Look we gotta take a break  In honor of Bill Donahue  Saying Wall Street  Main Street  One more time  What the hell  Before we bury this thing  It's the Wall Street  Main Street montage  Everyone is saying it  Saying it in the media today  There's no question  That the troubles  On Wall Street  Have absolutely bled  Into Main Street  To make sure  That Main Street 
[01:53:30]  Is getting the same  Kind of help  That Wall Street's getting  Well bad news  From Wall Street  Has folks on Main Street  And a panic  What does it mean  For Wall Street  What does it mean  For the rest of us  Maybe on Main Street  Main Street  Is looking for accountability  From Wall Street  And that of course  Impacts both Wall Street  As well as Main Street  And we must insulate  Main Street  From Wall Street  Understand that this is  Just as much about Main Street  As it is about Wall Street  Wall Street is Main Street folks  I don't want to spend  All this money  To bail out  These Wall Street fat cats 
[01:54:00]  It's also bailing out Main Street  What else is going on  In the world  This is the Opie and Anthony show  We got a story from yesterday  That we never got to  Another home invasion  See  Where  And you know what  We laugh at your scenarios  But  They come true  This is  I know what home invasions 
[01:54:30]  Are all about  That's why I am  Protecting myself  Constantly  Through the use  The responsible use  Of my right  My Second Amendment right  We laugh at your paranoia  At times  But then these stories  Come out  And it's like  Wow  This is pretty much  The scenario  That Anthony spells out  For everybody  Sure  What happened  Here it is  Duct tape  Holds a 17 year old  Girl's bedroom window  Closed after a terrifying  Incident early Sunday morning  What could have been  A very tragic situation  For a 17 year old girl  Has turned into  The death of the assailant 
[01:55:00]  Nice  The assailant  Was a convicted sex offender  Who broke into the house  Wearing nothing but a mask  And latex gloves  He had in his possession  A knife  There was some rope  Some condom  It was about 3 in the morning  When the girl's parents  Were awakened  She awoke  Saw this naked man  In the bedroom  With the mask on  She started screaming  The father subdued the man  By wrapping his arms  Around the man's neck  When police arrived  The suspect had died  His wife called 911  And that's when  The police arrived  And found him  On the floor  With his arm 
[01:55:30]  Around the neck  Of Mr. Myers  Struggling  Holding him down  Authorities say  The assailant  52 year old  David Myers  Had a history  Of heart trouble  Michael Myers  The father is not  Expected to be charged  Good  How great is that  That is fantastic  He was probably like  Called 911  Nine  Where was that  Where was that  Somewhere  It's hard though  Somewhere USA  It's hard to wrestle  A naked man though  It's any town USA  It could be  Wait  Voss wants to go into a bit

[03:07:00]  From the family now  No  It happened three weeks ago  The whole family  They have hard-ons  The whole family's here  Who's hosting  Tim Gage  He's got a story  That he doesn't want to tell now  Why?  Because family's listening  You got family listening right now  No no  I'll tell you next week  I swear  Yeah  Tell us  You're counting on the town  Of Belmore  To show up to governors  This weekend  That's what it is  They're all coming to governors  Was that  It's just him and you?

Yeah  She's not in Dayton  She's not in Dayton the week after  Because she decided not to be  No  No no no  What's the problem?  Because it's a lot of work 
[03:08:00]  Taking a baby on the road  So we only do nice kids  It's a lot of work taking a baby  Like hilarities  And she's got the kid to worry about too  Are you going to do play on words like that this weekend?  Yeah because I don't  I have to  Because I don't have my wife  To write my good jokes for me  Hey we got someone  I know it only lasted two weeks  You blew it  Bonnie I still deserve to laugh on mine  Dayton's what Bonnie wants to be doing  Nice 
[03:08:30]  Hey we got a guy  That went to high school  With that teacher  That is going to jail for six years  Mike in New Hampshire  Mikey  Mike  Hello Mike  Yeah I went to high school with this girl  She used to be pretty straight  Top of the class  All that  Married right when she graduated high school  Didn't go to school or anything  And  Yeah apparently  Fuck are you in the audience of governors?  Oh 
[03:09:00]  So  Sorry buddy keep going  That's alright  I didn't have that story  But it's true  That's the ones that usually get like that  The ones that were straight  And they held it back in high school  Not the hewas  They didn't get to leave  They have to relive that high school  Yeah  Your mom was exactly the same way  She used to  She used to  Be the cheerleading coach  Wanted to  Good God  Life in high school  Should we just bail?  No I mean  It's an interesting story  It is interesting  Was she hot? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah she was smoking  Back in high school  She was the captain  On the cheerleading team  Who the mom or her?  How come she got fat then?  What happened?  How come she was straight laced  If she was a hot cheerleader?  What was her best here?  We're all asking questions  She got married right after high school  So I'm assuming that's why she got fat  Who'd she marry?  Where'd she meet him?  I love the realism  She got married  I'm assuming that's why she got fat  That's great  That's exactly what it is  Yeah  Yep  But I guess she went on a skiing trip  With her husband  A couple months ago 
[03:10:00]  And brought the little boy  Are you going to do all the space too?  So what's the husband like?  A cuckold?  I don't know  A fucking pederast cuckold?  Jimmy knows a lot about that  Jimmy can you talk about the bull?  Hold on I gotta put this guy at hold  Well sir in a cuckold situation  What's happened is  Cucky will sit there  While the black bull  Takes care of the wife  And a lot of times in order to prepare 
[03:10:30]  The wife  The bull must be serviced  And prepared  By the cuckold  Wait a minute  By the same guy?  Yeah  The husband  A lot of times will watch  But other times  The bull will need prep work  But then the bull must be like bisexual  I don't know what the bull is  I just know that the bull is there to do the wife  If the wife tells the cuckold to prepare the bull  Then the bull is prepared  That doesn't make sense  Of course it does  The bull's unit is moistened  So he understands you take the wife out of this scenario 
[03:11:00]  I'm a big fan of the bull discussion  I like the fact that everybody's heckling the caller  He's a New Hampshire guy  And he was like  Oh so what do you want  Dane Cook  The guy's trying to tell you the story  He's like  Hey this guy's boring  He's a caller  He's not an entertainer  Shut up  Stop trying to take the high road  We're talking about cuckolds and bulls  That's right  It's because you're a cuckold  And you don't like the fact that  There's a word for what you do  What's that?  I suppose nothing  Oh well we got someone that's involved in cuckold activities 
[03:11:30]  Footer  Footer  Yo whoo  This is some cuckold talk  I want people calling me if there's cuckold talk  I want to be involved  Yeah footer knows a little thing or two about this  Is he any relation to Plankfoot?

You know what?  I don't have much to bring to the table  I'm a calf  I've been a little slow on the cuckold tip lately  Alright  I'll get back to you  Alright thank you footer  You gotta have eight inches to be a bull

[03:26:30]  Ever  Jimmy's like a guy  You know  This is  You are a guy  That got caught up  In one of those  Pyramid schemes  This is the same  Type of thing  Remember like years ago  People were all like  Dude  I'll get you in on this thing  Look  It's a pyramid  And then it builds up  And once you're at the top  Everyone gives you the money  It was good if you got in early man  And it never got in  I never knew one person  That got paid off  I don't care how early  Or late they got in  Got paid off on a pyramid scheme  You had to be in early  You had to be 
[03:27:00]  You had to be the guy  That thought it up  Is what it is  You had to be early  The guy number one  Why don't we bring back  The pyramid scheme  Pyramid scheme  We'll start with our listeners  Out there  Yeah  You give us your money  $100 a piece  And then you bring in  Three of your friends  To give you money  To give you money  But then you got to  Give us that money too  What's funny  Eventually you work  Your way up to the top  And the cops come  And bust it  And you go broke  Yeah  Then you're mad  Jimmy you're  I'm not  It's not even mad 
[03:27:30]  It's like murderous  Like I really would love  To cut somebody down  With a rifle  I would love to do that  I would even take the jail hit  And just  It would feel so good  Go to the range  Do a little target practice  Right through one of their  Fucking suit jackets  Fucking scumbag  It's like  I'm not some greedy scumbag  That always played with money  I was really concerned  But I pay my fucking mortgage  What happened  Did you get a little greedy  Did you get  No  Just because I'm like  I'm fucking  But were you listening  And going like  Wow okay this sounds good  No because it's a slow build 
[03:28:00]  I'm like conservative  Yeah  But they probably  Like you said  They probably put me more in stock  Yeah  Because what they do  Being the fucking scumbag  Vultures that they are  They don't listen  They don't want to go conservative  Because they don't give a fuck  Yeah  Because it's not their money  But no  It was just a matter of like  I'm in my  I was fucking 39 when I did it  Or actually 40  I never invested my life  I said well you gotta have  Something invested  Yeah  Just common sense  I'd be stupid not to invest something  So that's why I started doing it  And it's not gonna break me  I'm not gonna fucking lose my 
[03:28:30]  It's none of that shit  It'll come back  I hate watching my money  Go down the toilet  When I never fucked with the stock market  Never  There's confusion here  You're not doing any boiler room shit  No  You're doing very  Legitimate stocks  A lot of energy stocks  You know what then  You'll be alright  It'll come  It comes back  It ain't coming back  You can't watch  It'll come back  Citadel won't come back  But  Shit like that  That'll come back  You put it in a drawer  And just  Don't even look at it  You put it in a drawer  I got the call yesterday  You might wanna lighten it a little bit

[03:31:30]  Weird stuff  You should know it  When we started  Investing back in the day  They got me into  Some breast cancer drug  That was supposed to be  Speculative  Fucking  Pharmaceutical  Oh my god  That's insane  They're like  You gotta get it now  It's gonna be 100  By the end of the year  This thing is  The last I checked  Which is months ago  I was trading at $1.10  Or something  Yeah no no  It was not like that  I lost probably  $50,000 to $70,000  On that one stock alone  Don't invest in the stock  Either  Invest in the sector  Well I know that now  I didn't know back in the day 
[03:32:00]  When everyone was day trading  And buying stocks  Like you got  I got Dell Jimmy  Dell  You have it now  Yes  I'm losing my shirt on Dell  A lot of mutual funds  I got it  Three different times  On that one  We should maybe lighten it  Yeah  Really  Well where was that  When I told you  Fucking $30,000 ago  To lighten it  So you already lightened it  Where was that  Oh  So we'll see  You took a hit  And then we got that  I want to  I fucking  I'll take the hit  I'll survive it 
[03:32:30]  Because I'll yank it  I just know not to get  Mixed up in that shit  There's a certain  It's a  It's a certain  Fucking scumbag  Something for nothing  Mentality  Yeah  There's a certain  Fucking get something  For nothing  And I never did that  You can't have a guy  Shuffling your shit around  Every day  Fucking  You should have a say  In every fucking penny  That gets moved  Back and forth  And it should be reviewed  Every so often  You sit down with the guy  Review your folder  And look at everything  And then  And then he'll point things out 
[03:33:00]  To you and go  Here's what you need  To maybe  Maybe we'll get a little more  On this  Because it's more of a  Longer term look  At what's been going on  When I sit down  With my finance guy  After like three months  I could look at  Three months of the market  And it gives you  A better idea  What the market's doing  Than it does  With one day  Panic sell it  Holy fuck buy it  Oh shit what am I doing  Yeah you'll have a heart attack  Before you're 45 there Jimmy  I shouldn't have just  I should have just  Paid my mortgage off  Well  Because I'm fucking  First of all 
[03:33:30]  Six percent of the fucking  Scumbag bank  Yeah  Annoyes me  So if you can be  Debt free  I mean I'm not going to  Be able to do that  But the less I pay in interest  The happier I am  How long have you been  In the market though  A couple of months  That's the beauty of it  Oh you're insane  You're going to lose your mind  Get out  You're going to have to get out  Because you can't handle this  I could handle it  If it wasn't the worst  Economic times  Since ever  1907  Yeah you really did  Kind of get in  Just that's not comforting  The fact that I got in  Just don't  Don't look at it for now  But all the money  Will be gone by the time  It plays out  As long as it's solid stocks 
[03:34:00]  And you're not doing like  Insane stuff  I have no faith in any stock  Because even Apple is down  It's all down  Apple's gone back up today  A little bit  It's up like four  Four and a half bucks today  I'm just saying  That's a big one  They want to know  Are you in  Is it an S&P 500 index fund  I wouldn't know  I don't know  I hear people saying  That you might be overreacting  I'm just saying  I'm not overreacting  I'm not trying to get you  I'm not trying to get you  I'm not trying to get into  Flat screen TVs  You know  I heard from InsideSource  They can convert all the TVs  Well you know

[03:42:00]  What do you mean  Like if you  Lose money  In a stock  You can't just write it off  But if you made money  On a stock  You could take the  Amount that you lost  And use it to offset  The capital gains tax  On what you  So if you lose money  You can't write it off  If you lose  You still win  But if you  Only if you win  Somewhere else  If you lose  You win  But if you win  Oh you gotta pay  Through the fucking nose  Of capital gains tax  Right  But if you lose  You can't  Sorry you just lost  I thought it was  Write it off  You could write it off  No  Apparently you can only
