<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Andrew Dice Clay's stand-up routine, mocking various religions' Christmas traditions.  Opie and Anthony then promoted their show, giving out phone numbers for listeners to call.  Jim Norton complained about overindulging in coffee cake. They reminisced about past promotional stunts: a limo wedding and a giant Pop-Tart.  Gary Hoey, a musician known for Christmas music, was introduced as the in-studio guest.

A phone interview with Steve Irwin and his wife Terri followed, discussing Irwin's career and injuries. The interview was abruptly ended by a conference coordinator, provoking angry and offensive language from the hosts.

The show resumed with listener calls, including one from Bridget offering suggestive services. A lengthy segment focused on Jim Norton's exceptionally foul-smelling flatulence, resulting in the creation of a "fart protocol."  Further calls included discussion of a song ("Police Stole My Car") written by Opie's brother, Joe, which seemed to have been stolen by another radio show.  Johnny Race's strip club escapades were also recounted.  More calls followed, discussing the Steve Irwin interview and criticizing Geraldo Rivera's journalistic ethics.  Big Chocolate, a recurring caller with musical aspirations and questionable Comedy Central connections, was heavily featured.  This segment ended with Gary Hoey performing.

Gary Hoey's in-studio segment continued, detailing his near-miss audition for Ozzy Osbourne's band, attributing his rejection to Zach Wilde's superior physique.  The usual host banter ensued.  A large portion focused on "Stalker Patty," a listener known for bizarre handmade Christmas gifts.  This year's gift, a painted syndication map, was famously destroyed by Opie, causing Patty distress.  The interaction included crude and offensive jokes, culminating in Opie urinating on the gift.

The show then shifted to a discussion of NBC airing liquor commercials, debating the appropriateness of alcohol advertising and the concerns of the AMA and MADD.  Listener calls followed, including one about an oral yeast infection possibly linked to oral sex. More off-color humor, discussions of bodily fluids, sexual acts, and offensive jokes targeting listeners and guests continued.  Gary Hoey performed another song.

The final segment featured an extended performance by Gary Hoey, surprising the hosts. Numerous phone calls detailed unusual sexual preferences and encounters; one caller described a woman enjoying being hit during sex, another recounted a bizarre ping-pong ball and genitals incident, and another detailed his brother's marijuana-in-a-sock arrest.  A planned "Motley Crue teen kitty litter box challenge" for the next day was discussed, and a listener volunteered. A crude fake commercial for a Jim Norton doll aired.  The show concluded with vulgar language, sexually explicit discussions and impersonations (including Mike Tyson), and the playing of "Ding Fries Are Done".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey! Merry Christmas, New York! You're listening to Andrew Dice Clay.  Not, you know, the wannabe.  E-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-t-a-me!  There is no Christmas in the silly Middle East.  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus, they have different religious beliefs.  They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday.  And so every December I go to the Middle East and say. 
[00:00:30]  Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Christmas. Put down that book, the Koran, and here's some holiday wishes.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. So get off your heathen Muslim ass and celebrate.  There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd.  They never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about. And that is why in December, I'll go to India and shout. 
[00:01:00]  Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Christmas. Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the missus.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. So get off your heathen Hindu ass and celebrate.  Now I heard that in Japan, everyone just lives in sin. They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.  On December 25th, all they do is eat a cake. And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and try. 
[00:01:30]  Hi there, Mr. Shintoist, Merry Christmas. God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.  In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. So let's all rejoice for Jesus. Merry Christmas to you.  On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say.  Now it's Christmas bonus and all you atheists too. 
[00:02:00]  Merry Christmas to you.  Thank you, Mr. Hand.  Sounds like the beginning of a Martin Quinn police show.  That's where my brother gets his name from, Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah? I got a Quinn in my family.  From Martin Quinn.  Quinn Martin Production.  Oh, that's right. Quinn Martin.  Quinn Martin Production.  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Mannix.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  Cannon.  Remember Cannon?  Jim Norton looks like you just ate a lemon. You alright?  What's bothering you, bro?  I just shoved a piece of coffee cake, heavy coffee cake, and I just want to puke. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Guzzled it.  Whose mule was it around?  Are you hating yourself today because you had that?  Yeah.  Ever since I quit smoking.  I mean, I know it's normal to eat, but I should eat a little healthier.  Maybe some egg whites instead of shoving a piece of coffee cake.  You should have heard of him in the office.  He's eating the coffee cake.  And in between bites, he's like, yeah, go ahead.  Shove your...  Feed your fat-faced coffee cake.  You disgust me.  Like he's yelling at himself for eating a coffee cake. 
[00:03:30]  I'll actually do that.  I'll actually be chewing it, and I'll actually put it down, write the crumbs off, and pinch my fat breast.  Are you trying to say you have baloney boobs?  Oh, they're sickening.  They really are.  They're sickening.  They're udders.  Udders.  Hey, we got Ho-Ho-Ho-E outside the studio today.  I saw Gary Ho-E out there.  Gary Ho-E.  You have to say it like that, Anthony.  Gary Ho-E.  What the way Jared did when he was Promotions Director here at this station?  The only good thing he did for our radio show was to turn us on to Ho-Ho-Ho-E. 
[00:04:00]  Poor Gary Ho-E, too, because I got to tell you something.  Roger, the Promotions guy here, came up with so many bad, lousy ideas for our show,  and what would fit well on this program.  I like that one idea, where we were going to take a limo ride with a happy couple all the way to Atlantic City  and have them get married in the limo.  They'll get married in the limo.  Oh, and then, of course, my most famous one.  I wanted you guys to go and broadcast from Madison Square Garden next to the world's largest Pop-Tart. 
[00:04:30]  Guys, I think I can get you in to the world's largest Pop-Tart to broadcast right next to the Pop-Tart.  Swear to God.  And it wasn't even the world's largest Pop-Tart.  Know what it was?  It was a lot of regular Pop-Tarts put together to look like one big Pop-Tart.  Don't give me that crap.  I'm sure I would have shoved half of it into my dumb face.  So then he approaches us, guys, I have an idea for Christmas.  Gary Hoey.  Gary Hoey.  He does very rocking Christmas songs. 
[00:05:00]  And we're like, oh, Christ.  Roger brings it up.  It's got to suck.  You know?  But it had already been put down as a commitment.  So we're like, okay, at least we can goof on the guy and Roger at the same time.  And Gary comes in.  He starts playing the tunes.  He rocks.  Plays guitar.  And he's really good.  So Ho Ho Hoey.  He's going to be our little studio band today.  Right.  We're looking forward to it.  He's setting up as we speak.  So you're going to like it.  I'm telling you.  It jams the Christmas songs. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Norton, let me tell you something.  I know the type of music you like.  You're going to like this.  Really.  You are.  I really think you are.  I have very, very taste.  Go feed yourself.  And the best of his Ho Ho Hoey Christmas CD is in all the record stores.  Yes.  So there you go.  Look who's on line six.  This is killing me.  Why is it killing you?  I love this guy.  Steve Irwin.  G'day.  How are you, Mike?  Steve.  The crop comes down.  How are you?  I'm really good, thanks.  Very, very good.  Very happy to be on the show. 
[00:06:00]  Thanks for having me.  Where are you right now?  I'm in Queensland, Australia.  You are.  I am.  It's summer there, isn't it?  It is, mate.  It is.  It's the monsoon season.  It's all tropical.  The crocodiles are nesting.  They're all going ballistic.  It's hot as heck.  And there's lots of mozzie.  Lots of what?  Oh, mosquitoes.  Oh, mozzie.  Mozzie.  Now, Steve, I was a fan of your show when it first really hit here in the States. 
[00:06:30]  And I would always talk about this lunatic Australian guy that would jump in with the crocs.  And you're insane.  I'm sure you get that a lot.  People call you insane.  How did you start wrestling alligators and crocodiles?  Well, you know, it started at a young age, kind of when I was born.  I was born into wildlife.  See, my mum was Australia's pioneer in wildlife rehabilitation.  And my dad was a mad passionate herpetologist, one who studies reptiles. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, herpetology.  I was born into it.  They started up Australia's new in 1970, and I haven't looked back ever since.  And you know about the insane thing?  Well, what Dad did, which was a real blessing, he had the front part of my brain cut out when I was really young.  Yeah, oh, that explains it.  Now, Steve, do you remember a show we had in the States here called Wild Kingdom?  Yeah, absolutely.  I had the privilege of meeting Jim Fowler once.  Jim Fowler.  But then there was the other guy, the older guy.  Marlon Perkins.  Marlon Perkins. 
[00:07:30]  And he, I swear to God, I'm sorry to say this.  I know he's probably somebody who started this whole thing of getting wildlife on television.  Oh, Steve, what a pussy, right?  Oh, absolutely, mate.  The guy, the guy, what to get in there.  And then we turn on Steve Irwin, and I'm like, wait a minute.  You're supposed to be away from it in a blind somewhere.  But Steve is pretty much humping the crocodile right there in the water.  It's snapping at him.  You're grabbing him by the tail.  It's a very unorthodox way to do a wildlife show.  Mate, what we're about is conservation. 
[00:08:00]  And that's what we live here for, mate, is conservation.  So if I can get you, the viewer, right there with me in amongst the crocodiles, the blood,  the guts, and the beer, then we're winning all the way.  Well, I saw you get bitten in the face by snakes.  Yep.  I saw you actually rope an animal from the hood of your vehicle.  Oh, that was one of my favorite animals.  That's great.  Like he was trying to get a hold on the animal from the side of the vehicle or something.  He was trying to rope it.  He couldn't rope it, so he just drove, had someone drive close to it and jumped off on it. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, that's it.  Now, what's the biggest injury you've had so far?  Um, I'd have to say my shoulder.  What happened was, um, back in the 80s when I was, um, full-on rescuing crocodiles from  North Queensland, there was this little croc, and everyone was trying to shoot him dead.  So I went in there with a spotlight, and I got his eye shined.  I snuck the boat up in on him, and when I got close, I dived on the crocodile, and I  didn't know it, but he was sitting on a big rock. 
[00:09:00]  And so I smashed my shoulder, and, um, lucky enough, I still kept one hand on the croc.  The croc swung around and grabbed me on the wrist, and Dad always told me, if they bite  you, you know you've got them.  So I hung on, and, um, got him back to camp, and was able to release him back into the wild.  But my shoulder has actually been plaguing me ever since, but I've had a couple of surgeries  on it, and, um, it's not doing too bad at the moment.  You are truly a man, Steve Irwin.  You are truly, you are so macho. 
[00:09:30]  Uh, you met your wife in the States?  Yeah, mate, yeah, she's right here, actually, if you want to say g'day to her.  Yeah, let me talk to her for a minute.  Sure thing, good morning.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  I gotta tell, I gotta tell you, you, you're about as crazy as, uh, he is.  Well, you know, he's not entirely crazy, because he did marry me.  Well, you know something, uh, he, he's the guy, he gets you involved in all of his stuff.  I've seen him ask you to sit on a croc. 
[00:10:00]  It's, it's true, he has asked me to do that, and in fact, the first time he asked me to  do that was on our honeymoon.  Sit on, no, was it croc?  Did I hear it, Tom?  When we got married, there was a crocodile that needed to be rescued, so he said honeymoon  or croc rescue, so off we went, we took a film crew and filmed our first documentary.  Look at you guys.  I imagine you've seen a lot of them, uh, do you prefer bigger crocs?  I do, because the smaller crocs tend to whip around and bite something off, but the big 
[00:10:30]  crocs are at least a little bit slower moving and more predictable.  Yeah.  Uh, what, what about you, have you been injured out there, uh?  Uh, I don't, I don't have the expertise Steve does.  I don't get in the predicament Steve does.  Yeah.  Because I don't know if I'd get out of them, but occasionally I've, I've had crocs nail  me here and there, and...  Pardon me, this is the conference coordinator.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  We need to go into our next interview.  Oh, damn it.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Well, thank you, thank you, Irwin.  Wait, wait, wait, who's that, who's that bitch? 
[00:11:00]  Hello?  Oh, who is that?  She didn't like, she didn't like the, um...  Who is that?  I don't know.  That must have been where the feedback was coming from.  Yep.  Oh.  That was absolutely where the feedback was coming from.  So she was listening in on us.  She was listening in.  She didn't like the content or something with the crocs and stuff.  We were talking about crocs.  The nerve of her to disconnect adults.  Dude, she didn't even, uh...  She didn't even give us a chance to say goodbye.  Why?  Or to plug anything.  They said it was going to be a short interview, but, uh, they didn't even get to plug what 
[00:11:30]  they wanted to plug.  What a twat.  Yep.  Stupid word.  This is the conference coordinator.  Coordinator.  Conference coordinator?  Ah.  Those words begin with C.  That's very appropriate.  Shortest one ever.  What a bitch.  We were having fun with Steve Irwin, though.  Yeah, see, people are yelling at us for the equipment, uh, feeding bag.  It wasn't us.  It was that bitch on the conference call.  Yeah, because we were running around trying to figure out what was going wrong on our end.  Everything was fine.  She probably was doing that on purpose. 
[00:12:00]  She was probably doing that on purpose.  Throwing the feedback in?  Right.  To make us, uh, shut up?  I had to shut my mic off and go to Norton's.  What do you expect?  An uptight, broad, in a skirt?  You know, I don't like that type of content.  What do you expect?  Well, do your research, man.  You're on the O.P. Anthony show.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  Guy attacks animals for a living, and they don't want a joke, a penis joke.  We couldn't even say goodbye to him.  I know.  That is weird.  Paul from Lawrence says, uh, did she ever have a crock, uh, come at her from behind? 
[00:12:30]  That's pretty good.  We were ready to ask all those questions.  Yeah, they didn't like the crock questions.  Do you like it when the crock comes from behind?  All right.  So a big crock came up behind her.  Oh, boy.  Oh, well.  Wow, that was, uh...  That, yeah, conference is over.  What a C.T.'s that interview was.  It's over.  Steve didn't even get to, uh, get to plug what he was plugging. 
[00:13:00]  That was a C.T.'s, bro.  Yeah.  We start off really fine.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  We got nowhere.  Thank God Gary Hoey's here to make up for that.  That was pretty much, uh, 17 all over again, dry humping all night and going home with the  blue balls.  Without the finish.  Right.  Bastards.  Uh, Bridget, what's up?  Hi.  Turn down your radio and tell us what you got today.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, because, uh, I don't think they, they allow us to 
[00:13:30]  put it quite that way.  Ah.  If you...  Yeah, if they dumped out Bridget, a 17 from Boston, she wants to come down and, uh, take  care of business in the, uh, litter box.  And the, the kitty litter box.  Ah, the Motley Crue cat litter box.  Yes.  Motley Crue.  So, Vince Neal yesterday told us that, um, during the concerts, he'd take these girls,  uh, from the audience, bring them under the stage during, like, a drum solo or something,  and the guys would watch the girls, uh, did someone fart? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, God.  Watch, he just hung up, too.  Dude, someone blast!  That's right.  Ben's cursing.  Ben's cursing.  Holy Jesus Christ, that smells so bad.  Come on, Jim.  You get it, John?  Totally interrupts everything.  Weren't you here when Anthony was doing his fart protocol for the show?  Oh, God, is that awful.  Jesus Christ.  Dude.  It's like I crawled in there.  Dude, you, you heard Anthony talk about the fart protocol, didn't you?  No, I was aware.  Oh, no. 
[00:14:30]  We set up a whole freaking set of rules for farting.  Give it.  Oh, my God.  Spray his.  Oh, Ben, help me.  Help me.  Spray his jeans directly.  Thank you.  No, get up and spray his.  I'm not going close.  Oh, my God.  John, go spray Norton's jeans.  Stand up, you stick F.  No, no, that's good.  Give me it, John.  Give me that, because I need some over here.  Oh, my God, I'm dying.  Oh, my God.  Dude, maybe you should be eating egg whites.  Oh, we need it back over here.  Back over. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh.  What was that, coffee cake wrapped in a dead skunk?  What a mess.  Do you know the. . .  I can still smell it.  Come on, Jim.  Oh, my God.  That was a daisy cutter of a fart.  He just let another one loose, dude.  Not it.  You got. . .  Oh, God.  Okay, Ben.  All right, Ben.  You got. . .  That's going to be. . .  I can't take it. 
[00:15:30]  You got a bunker buster in your pain.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Here's the fart protocol from now on.  Oh, I was happy.  Here's the fart protocol.  Wait a minute.  I think it's. . .  We're okay.  Can't tell with all the Lysol in the air.  Thank God.  Here's the protocol.  If you have to blast one, it can never, ever be in the studio.  You have to go out.  Now, here it is.  You can't just go out and pop it off and run back in.  It entrails you.  Right.  You got to go away.  Fart. 
[00:16:00]  Pat the back of your pants to get it out.  Wave it.  Diffuse it with your arm.  Walk around a little so it doesn't chase you.  Walk around in a circle.  Right.  A tornado.  A tornado-like circle to catch it and then break away from it and come back.  And let me tell you something.  The look on his face after.  Especially today because those are brutal.  The look on his face after he lets it go and then he's just waiting for the reaction.  You look like a cat that just finished all the food and sits there smiling like. . .  He was so proud of it.  Oh, God, is that pleasing. 
[00:16:30]  It was so bad.  So bad.  Wow.  Thank you.  What a weird start to a radio show.  Gavin the Aussie, what's up?  Hey, Swallowers.  Hey.  Hey, two words, butt plugs for a start.  But who organized that interview?  Uh, they asked us.  We were doing them a favor.  Do you want to talk to the croc hunter for, you know, for ten minutes?  I got right.  We said, all right.  And they said, well, it has to be done, you know, it has to go down right at three o'clock. 
[00:17:00]  Damn.  And then I guess someone got pissed off and cut the interview short.  Yeah, I was wondering what was going on.  Because as soon as you handed it up to the chick, I thought, uh-uh, the end is nigh.  Right.  Yeah, so we were hoping to get Steve back on the phone.  And the woman said, no, it's over.  We must have been really bad in her eyes because, you know, these publicity whores,  they didn't even allow us to, you know, promote what they were promoting.  Yeah.  So they'd rather not promote than have them on the show any longer.  Yeah, obviously, they weren't given the background by the show, of course. 
[00:17:30]  But, hey, there are mother stiffs over there.  They don't have radio like this, so you can't expect them to be free like you are over here.  There's a lot of restraint, and you don't get this sort of talk back over there.  So then you just wouldn't.  All right.  That's it.  All right.  Well, we're going to move through.  We got ho-ho-ho-ing.  There you go.  Yeah.  You help me.  Robert Zee is one of Norton has started eating his victims, and maybe that's why Jim smells so bad.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[00:18:00]  Hey.  Hey, I was walking through the office today, and I heard the, uh,  we stole my car song on the radio.  I walk over, and I'm like, hey, where'd you get that?  Oh, what station?  Is that Joe's song, right?  Yeah.  What, they're playing it on, uh, another show on Buffalo?  Yeah.  Yeah, Larry Norton, Storton Norton.  Really?  That show we make fun of all the time.  How did they steal that one?  Is it on the net?  Is it on Fountain?  How?  Supposedly there's a station in, another station in New York playing that song as well.  All right, Joe, go to town. 
[00:18:30]  People stealing Joe's song.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  Stealing it on the, uh, website.  You guys should call Storton Norton in the morning and tell him how fat he is.  He's got to play off on Joe.  Well, it's, you know.  Storton Norton.  And it's not even like one of those song parodies that you can grab from anywhere.  Just, you know.  It was made for our show.  My brother.  It's Joe.  It was made for our show.  It's my brother.  Ah, that's funny.  Jesus, man.  It's pretty pathetic because there's nothing we can do about it.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  That's what, that's what we get for sharing our stuff on the internet.  All right, Anthony, we're going to take a break and regroup.  Mm-hmm.  Let us do that.  My favorite Christmas song we're going to play going into break.  All right.  A song we've been playing for many, many years, Anthony.  Yes.  It's a, it's a classic.  Of course it is.  It's a retarded guy.  I love this damn thing.  It's an ONA fave.  When we get back, we'll talk to Ho Ho Hoie and we'll regroup, okay? 
[00:19:30]  Hold on.  Brother Joe's in, though?  Brother Joe.  Yes.  Hey, man.  Do I have grounds for a lawsuit?  No, it's on the internet.  I know.  That sucks.  I just wanted to let you guys know I didn't send it off to anybody.  No, you wouldn't.  They grabbed it off the left.  Brother Joe, trust me, you would never send anything to the Snortin' Norton Morning Show.  Ho Ho!  You're damn straight.  Ass.  All right, I just wanted to clear it with you guys.  A show where they play the Entertainment Tonight theme and just read down all the entertainment news. 
[00:20:00]  Seriously.  That's sad.  They do it with a serious tone, like it's a really good bit.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[00:20:30]  The original bits.  Nice.  Someone give me the Gary Glitter song so I can do the sports scores from the night before.  Brother Joe.  That really sucks.  That's good for you.  More exposure.  I guess so.  It's pathetic that, you know, he would do that, but...  Hey, Joe.  What? 
[00:21:00]  You're residing currently at the race residence, right?  That's correct.  What time did Johnny come stumbling in last night?  There's a whole back story to that one.  Is there?  It was late, man, but the worst part was Dawn had to get up after an exhausting day of work  and go pick him up at the Ron Concoma train station.  She was his.  Does she know where he was?  I have no clue.  I don't know.  Privilege Gentleman's Club. 
[00:21:30]  Everybody went down to Privilege last night.  Johnny Race was getting...  Supposedly he was getting topless at the strip club last night.  Johnny's ripping his clothes off and...  This is rock and roll, Johnny Race.  Rock and roll.  Johnny Race.  Rock and roll.  Giving in turn, man, me a lap dance.  When do you guys call me for that stuff?  I'm single.  Call me for that stuff.  Dave's also telling the staff that he runs NEW along with Big Kev.  He was trying to get in there. 
[00:22:00]  But he was waving around 50.  He's like, I got money.  Look at this.  I have money.  Points off.  He was taking his clothes off at the club, though.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, stay tuned for the interaction tonight.  Thanks for letting that out over the air.  I got to be here and watch the repercussions.  Hey, give us a report.  Hey, Brother Joe.  I'll let you know all about it.  Roll tape, roll tape, roll tape, roll tape.  Nice.  Rock and roll. 
[00:22:30]  All right, there you go.  Later on, gentlemen.  Later, man.  The author of Police Stole My Car.  Yes.  Anthony's brother, Joe.  Such a good song.  Other morning shows have decided to play it.  That's cool.  Good work, Joe.  Guess they ran out of stuff to get from Prep Burger.  Prep Burger?  It's Joe Burger.  What's the matter, Snortin' Norton?  There wasn't anything on Bitboard this morning?  You could play on your show and make believe it was yours?  You know what the funny thing is?  They'd probably just, like, take it. 
[00:23:00]  Probably just troll through it and go, all right, we'll take this.  Like, no one's going to notice?  Like, no one's going to notice?  All right, well, here's a Christmas ditty we love playing every year.  Yeah.  And we'll be back.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I work at Booker King, make him play with whoppers.  I wear paper hats.  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that? 
[00:23:30]  Ding-pies are-done.  Ding-pies are-done.  Ding-pies are-done.  Ding-pies are-done.  I gotta run, I gotta run, I gotta run, I gotta run  Don't buy for fries and hot fat, it really hurts bad  And so do skin grabs  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Where is the bell? Wait for the bell  Can't hear the bell, where is the bell?  Ding fries are done, ding fries are done  Ding fries are done, ding fries are done  I'm a booger booger king, making flavor whoppers  I would pay for hats 
[00:24:00]  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Would you like an apple pie with that?  Ding-ba-da-dun, ding-ba-da-dun, ding-ba-da-dun, ding-ba-da-dun.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Psycho.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mince?  No! It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stalk-raving mad person. 
[00:24:30]  No! I'm getting hit!  No! No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, please give us a call, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:25:00]  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Max in D.C., what's going on?  First of all, good day to you fellows, Mr. Norton.  What's up, man?  I have never laughed so goddamn hard in my entire life as I just did at that song.  Ever.  Which one?  Ever.  The mentally challenged gentleman in the holiday tier.  We love that song.  No, no, you don't understand.  I lost my mind.  Every time we played that... 
[00:25:30]  I had to pull off the road.  It was...  The tears haven't dried from my cheek.  Every time we played that over the years, people just laughed.  Last year...  I was out of control.  They laugh and laugh.  The year before, any time we play that old favorite here on the O&A show, it gets such  a response.  Yes, sir.  Well, it was absolutely killer.  And what do you thought coming down to D.C.?  Just getting a little fed up.  I understand the ratings are falling, but I like the show. 
[00:26:00]  Well, we'll get down there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll definitely get down there.  Well, thank you, gentlemen.  Good day to you, sirs.  All right.  Thank you.  Norton is God.  Thank you, sir.  There you go, Anthony.  An old favorite.  Norton is Lord.  The guy in D.C. loves the old favorite.  Yeah, look at that.  Big Chocolate.  What's up there?  How my crack is doing today?  Oh, God.  What's up?  What's going on?  I just want to thank you all for hooking the brother up with Comedy Central there.  Good looking out.  What?  You did not hook up with Comedy Central.  Yeah.  Y'all know the girl called you live one year, and y'all gave me props, and she called me up. 
[00:26:30]  I'm going to do some songs for their new show next year.  You are so full of crap.  I'm not full of it, you know?  No, I'm telling you the truth.  What, Rick?  Remember we did that as a goof?  Yeah, but nothing happened.  He's lying.  I've talked to the girl at Comedy Central, y'all.  Oh, stop it.  I have sent them songs already, man.  You know something?  Here's what happened.  A girl from Comedy Central called this show.  We put her on the air.  She thought she was just talking to one of us.  Right.  She told me that.  And she wanted to know who somebody was that wrote songs.  No, no, no.  Wanted to know who does the songs that we start the breaks with. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  That would be, obviously, like the Jane's Addiction Mountain song we just played.  She thinks that, you know, you and I, or we have people that do those songs for us.  Right.  Because some unknown show that she said they're working on over there at Comedy Central needs  this music.  And as a joke, we gave her Big Chocolate's number because Big Chocolate is so bad.  He's in school.  So bad.  I got the best comedy songs in the country.  Y'all know that, man.  Oh, stop it.  Don't hate.  But hey, she called me and she likes it. 
[00:27:30]  You know what I'm talking to the producers?  No, no.  No, she called you because she wants a sample of the songs that she has heard on our show.  But the songs we play on our show are from real artists out there.  And you...  Oh, what do you mean?  I'm a real artist, too, man.  I recognize it.  You know what I mean?  And you...  How much you want to bet they're not going to use your music on their...  Yeah.  I bet you one of my songs...  You're about to have a guy do some songs on your show now.  I bet you my songs are better than his songs.  Oh, you're better than Ho Ho Hoie?  I'll bet you that right now.  We'll let the people decide.  How much crack do you smoke, Big Chris?  You know what I mean?  Come on.  You flat-ass crackers got to recognize, man. 
[00:28:00]  How much crack do you smoke?  Huh?  How much crack do you smoke?  Maybe two a day, man.  You know?  You're not going to be on Comedy Central.  Come on.  Hey, ask my big-head friend in Sacramento there, Kid Chris.  He was going to hook me up with...  Oh, stop it.  No one's hooking you up.  It was Comedy Central a while ago, but he played it.  You suck.  No one's hooking you up.  Shut up.  No one's hooking you up with anything.  Kid Chris hates you.  Pencil dick bastards.  I've got the best coffee in the country, man.  Norton, you the man.  What's up, cuz?  Thank you, Mr. Chalk.  Yeah, there it is. 
[00:28:30]  How you feel?  Man, when are you going to let me open up for you, baby?  No, I would like that.  We get on stage together and do our thing, right?  Yeah, I think.  No, I only do it myself, but I'd be more than happy to have you.  Put a brother on.  I hear you.  I hear you.  You know who you ought to have open up for you?  Oh, an A there.  They pull their peckers out of their pants, and that will get a real laugh, man.  You know what I mean?  Two inches.  You there?  You there?  The only way you should be hooked up was made illegal about 170 years ago. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, hey, hey, Ann, I'm telling you, man, they love it.  It's going to be out on Comedy Central next year.  You're going to hear my lyric.  Shut up.  And you're going to kiss my chocolate ass when I prove you wrong.  Oh, God, you delusional Negro.  All right.  Stop it.  All right, man.  My muscle man, I hate you.  You can admit it, right?  Make a fool of yourself.  Hey, chocolate, why don't you sing your latest little ditty?  All right.  Hey, can I do one for Stalker Patty, all right?  I kick it.  All right.  The Stalker Patty.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me set it up for you, ladies and gentlemen.  Listen to how bad this guy is.  The greatest comedy song lyrics in the world. 
[00:29:30]  Here we go.  Little Elvis Presley teddy bear.  I kick it like this.  Oh, won't you let me be your big chocolate man?  Come and bite my chocolate bar like no other slut can.  Oh, let me be.  Oh, let me be your chocolate man.  I don't like Mariah Carey.  Janet Jackson ain't too tough.  But man, that slut stalker.  Thank you, Opie.  There's applause coming from outside.  When you hung up, did you hear people applauding outside? 
[00:30:00]  Applauding outside the studio.  What is that?  That guy.  Delusional.  Is so delusional.  I was enjoying the big chocolate song.  Oh, shut up.  The big chocolate song.  It's not even a song.  It ain't babble.  Hey, Dan from Hoboken.  Yeah.  Is that retard Christmas song going to be on the same CD release as the STP Sour Girl performance from your show?  Maybe.  Call once for yes.  Maybe.  What an idiot.  Anthony, don't worry about big chocolate. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, he annoys the crap out of me.  Because, you know, you kind of want to get it into their head that they're just morons.  Like, he goes about his business every day thinking he's hooked up with Comedy Central.  He's calling people.  When he called us, he was talking about Kid out there.  Like, he's buddies with him in Sacramento.  Yeah.  And Kid's playing his stuff.  We called Kid up and he says, no, this guy's an idiot.  He sucks.  I make fun of him.  He plays his stuff to make fun of him.  And I hate the thought that he's calling other stations around the country going, yeah, O&A, play my stuff. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, but he may be on Comedy Central.  Have you watched it, Comedy Central?  Yeah.  It's possible.  Well, let's give anyone a show.  All right.  Well, yikes.  Hey, Anthony, Geraldo's coming back for the holiday.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Lying Geraldo?  Yeah, Geraldo will be back in time for Christmas, I guess.  Geraldo.  Way to put in the effort there, Geraldo.  Today I was watching on Fox News.  He's crawling through the caves now.  And they had this little camera following him crawling out of a cave. 
[00:31:30]  He had the towel on his head and he's crawling out.  He looked like one of the guys.  I was like, who is that?  Is that just one of the Afghanis crawling out?  And no, it was Geraldo.  Get this, though.  I've been telling you how full of crap Geraldo was.  And no one needs to tell people.  Just remember, this is the same guy that opened up Al Capone's vault and found nothing.  Plugged it for months that it was going to be this great thing.  They're going to find money, Tommy guns. 
[00:32:00]  He goes, perhaps even an old-style gangster's car.  They opened it up, what was in there?  Nothing.  Oh, there was a bottle.  A bottle, a booze bottle.  Perhaps this was some of the bootleg liquor.  Shut up.  Not.  It says NyQuil on it, you idiot.  So here's the latest about Geraldo.  Now, Fox News correspondent, Geraldo Rivera, caught in a lie, Opie.  He said that he did a report on December 6th where he became all emotional and choked up 
[00:32:30]  while standing on what he called hallowed ground in Afghanistan where friendly fire took so many of our men  and the Mujahideen yesterday, Rivera said, as he recited the Lord's prayer on this hallowed ground.  Well, reports coming out that Rivera was reporting several hundred miles from the actual site that he was standing on, 
[00:33:00]  saying it was hallowed ground.  That's like saying we're broadcasting from...  Ground zero.  Washington.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Several hundred miles away.  Like, going on the air and saying, we're in the middle of Boston right now.  Right.  What kind of an ass...  We're outside Fenway doing our radio.  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  That's how off he was.  What kind of an ass would lie about the distance from a location?  Wait a minute.  Here it is, though.  Now, he's got an explanation, but it might have a few holes in it. 
[00:33:30]  In an interview Tuesday, Rivera said he confused the Kandahar deaths with another friendly fire incident  that caused several Afghani lives in Tora Bora.  So he confused that place that he was standing on with the other ones.  But, according to reports, the Tora Bora incident occurred three days after Rivera's December 6th report.  It is Geraldo of the future.  I knew that he was going to die here when I reported. 
[00:34:00]  I haunted my DeLorean.  So, again, Geraldo just proving himself to be this sensationalistic non-reporter.  He wants to call himself a war correspondent, but he lies about where he is.  And then he did that sniper fire thing that was just crap.  He's laying on the ground doing a report.  Well, we can't prove that.  I'm proving it.  It's crap.  You're trying to prove it.  I say it's crap.  I didn't notice CNN reporting it.  I say it's crap. 
[00:34:30]  How you reported it?  Well, that's me.  I'm reporting.  I'm a war correspondent correspondent.  And I'm reporting it was a lie.  The guy's sitting there, and he says he heard a shot.  The cameraman jiggles.  The cameraman's his brother.  And Geraldo gets down lower to the ground and continues doing his report.  If a sniper fired a shot that Geraldo insists was meant for him or something, just missed him, he heard the bullet wing by his ear, would you continue to just go, oh, that was close?  I am here now talking about, no, you run your ass to cover. 
[00:35:00]  You get behind another rock or something.  So I think that whole thing was fabricated.  And why not?  He's several hundred miles away from a location that he's weeping, doing the Lord's Prayer and talking about how it's hallowed ground.  And why is he coming back for the holiday?  I think because the bombing and stuff is over with.  Our men and women aren't coming home for the holiday.  No.  They've got to stay there.  He's done over there.  They're pretty much done bombing.  Do you think he's coming back for good, or is he just taking a break? 
[00:35:30]  Maybe he's just taking a break.  I don't know.  I think he's coming back, but he's probably going to tell people he's still there.  I think he'll be behind a bush talking about how bombs had just fallen right before they came to me live here in Afghanistan.  And the camera will accidentally pan a little left, and you'll see Jersey Turnpike sign.  And it'll quickly go back.  I didn't know there was a Jersey Turnpike here in Afghanistan, too.  He's full of crap.  I, don't get me wrong, entertaining is a son of a bitch. 
[00:36:00]  When I saw him crawling out of that cave, that little teeny, it was a little teeny cave, and he come crawling out,  and he had one of those cameras on that looked like that show Fear.  Oh, from the MTV show Fear?  Yeah, it looked like a big fat face coming out of a cave, big fat Geraldo monster coming out of a cave.  It's funny.  You know we sent 20 staffers through there first to make sure a mine wasn't going to blow those valuable Geraldo yam bags off.  Please crawl through this 80 times. 
[00:36:30]  There might be a mine.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's hanging?  I just have to say this.  That guy, Big Chocolate, he stinks worse than Norton's farts, bro.  Yeah.  Please don't play him anymore.  He is so delusional.  Oh, you guys want to make your ratings good in Washington, D.C., send him there.  He can be your man.  What, Big Chocolate?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  All right, thank you.  He's awful.  He's good, guys.  He's the best.  And then on top of it, someone crunched in the no-crunching zone, Anthony.  Did you go crunch after that part? 
[00:37:00]  No, I hold it in so I hold it.  Did Gary Hoey crunch or did...  Ho, Ho, Ho, Hoey, you didn't crunch, right?  I always claim it if I do.  Yeah.  I think it might have been John the intern.  Oh, my God.  No.  Holy Jesus.  Go ask him.  And make sure that son of a bitch doesn't lie.  We have a rule, Gary.  If it's that bathroom out there, it's got no ventilation.  There are no windows in here.  So when someone takes a crunch in there, it reeks the entire area out.  So that has been dubbed a no-crunching bathroom.  It's just for number one, as they call it. 
[00:37:30]  And there's another bathroom down the hall that is used for crunching.  John.  Yes?  I don't want any lies.  Okay.  Did you crunch in that bathroom?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Why are you turning red, then?  Left.  I'm not.  I'm turning red because everyone's staring at me.  You did not crunch in that bathroom.  Give me a Bible.  Why did you think you crunched in?  I followed you into the...  Well, I didn't follow you into the bathroom.  I followed after you into the bathroom, and it smelled like a crunch happened.  I was actually going to mention that to you guys when I left, but I just hurried up and ran out. 
[00:38:00]  I was in there for like a minute, Opie, and you were like...  So whoever was in before you might have done the crunch in.  So who was in before you?  I have no idea.  I just walked in.  Rachel?  Who was?  I always go to the bathroom at McDonald's on the road.  Do you?  Yeah, I stop at one and eat, and I stop at the next one to take a dump.  All right.  Isn't that disgusting when you're in McDonald's or something, and you actually smell it waft out the bathroom door, one of the tables? 
[00:38:30]  No.  You are sick.  Does anything disgust you, Norton?  Not really.  Vomit does.  You don't like the vomit?  No.  Hi, who's this?  Hello.  Yo, what's up, bro?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yo, can you guys please do something about this a while, though?  Pick up the mess that that big-nosed other retard wouldn't finish.  Kick his ass.  Catch him out in the parking lot.  Do something to this guy.  I can't stand him.  He's doing a good job himself.  You know, I mean, Geraldo, even his name pisses me off. 
[00:39:00]  It's Joe Geraldo.  All right, guy?  I'm not conforming to his freaking Spanish influence over here.  So what he'll say, it's Joe's and everything like that.  All right?  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Catch that guy out there.  Very good.  Bye-bye.  Jesus.  Joe, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, O.N.  Hey.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  Joe, is that you?  No, that's not me.  All right.  What's up?  All right.  I got to go.  All right.  Who's messing with us?  Come on.  You're screwing around, right?  Joe.  No, I'm serious.  That wasn't me. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  So what's going on?  I just, I got some news for you guys.  You're a dick.  Hello?  Joe, put him on hold.  See if it's him.  Yeah, it was him.  Dude, it's him.  Someone could be picking up on his other line.  Joe.  Oh, you ass.  Joe, it's you.  It's your phone, jerk off.  Hello.  It's you.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is, idiot.  I swear to you.  We put you on hold and it stops.  And it goes away.  Why are we entertaining this?  Put me on hold again.  No.  Oh, come on.  I'm telling you. 
[00:40:00]  It's not me.  I just got some news for you guys.  Dude, if that doesn't stop, we're hanging up on you.  I swear to God.  All right.  Can you listen to me real quick?  Yeah.  All right.  That retarded thing that you guys played?  Hit your phone.  Hit your goddamn phone.  Hang on.  Let me switch phones.  Hit it.  Let me switch phones.  Ah, Don.  I hate that.  All right.  Now it's Joe.  All right.  Hold on.  It is us.  Do I have to apologize now?  No.  Screw it.  Screw him.  I hung up on that guy because I was convinced he was effing with us. 
[00:40:30]  Poor guy.  Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Joe.  Am I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, I was wondering if you guys could play that Burger King song again, please.  The retarded Christmas song?  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  Oh, getting a lot of...  It was wicked funny.  Yeah, we got lots of requests for that song.  All right.  You guys, come on.  You got to play it at least one more time today.  All right.  We'll play it a little later.  All right?  All right.  We got lots of requests for that song every time we play it, Anthony.  Ah, isn't that great?  We'll play it a little later, but as we go to break, why don't we play Brother Joe's song? 
[00:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  Police Got My Car.  Ho, Ho, Ho, We on the Way.  More of Your Phone Calls.  Oh, yeah.  And we got to find girls to come down here for the cat litter box thing.  We have a girl on Instant Feedback that is very interested, so...  Nice.  We might make that happen.  God, that would rock.  Dude, by the way, we downloaded Bob Rivers.  Yeah.  Bob Rivers does great song parodies.  Uh-huh.  Got to give him props.  Yeah.  He has a song called Police Got My Car. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  And Joe's song is Police...  Got My Car.  Yeah, it was Police Got My Car is Joe's song.  And what is Bob's?  Because it says the same thing on this.  Police Stop My Car?  Yeah.  Stop My Car?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let's hear.  So this is Bob Rivers.  All right.  Very famous radio personality that does some of the best song parodies out there.  Yeah.  Uh-oh, Joe might have some explaining to do.  Please stop my car. 
[00:42:00]  Uh-oh.  Police stop my car.  The police made me stop.  Walk a straight line and blow a balloon up.  Police stop my car.  Police stop my car.  Let's hear the chorus.  They say they're just making sure that there's no open bottles in my car. 
[00:42:30]  They want to wish me a soul, but Christmas.  That's why they always put me over Christmas.  They say they're just making sure that there's no open bottles in my car.  Police roadie block.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  So that's Bob Rivers.  Uh-huh.  And now here's Brother Joe.  All right.  Hey, man.  You want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid ass.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Ah, shut up, man.  The police got my car.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The police got my car.  All right. 
[00:43:30]  The police got my car.  Well, I was driving home from the bar.  Dude, that really sucks.  The police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got my car.  Well, I was driving home from the bar.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my 30 year 60 Chevy for Christmas.

[00:45:00]  So we could go get drunk at the bar  Calm down, man  Ah, shut up, man  What do you think, Anthony?  Yeah, wow  Well, you know, Brother Joe's is funnier  That's, um...  Boy, that's really a tough call  Like the opening part  It sounds the same  I like the Cheech and Chong angle  A little different  The chorus different  It's a little edgier 
[00:45:30]  Wait, how about I cue both of them up to the beginning of the song here  All right  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man  The police didn't got my car  What do you mean the police got your car?  All right  All right, so it's kind of cued up  So here's, uh...  Here's, uh...

[00:47:00]  Can I say one thing in defense of Brother Big Chocolate?  No, I don't think Joe stole it  Because I know a comic named Mark Cohen  Who's very funny  And for years  And I know Joe never saw him  For years has been singing around this time  It's the police  Oh my God  So that's a common theme  So I don't think Joe took it  Hayes from D.C. saying  This is turning out to be like  Gallagher and Gallagher 2 feud  I got Gallagher  I got to hear a little more at the same time 
[00:47:30]  That's great  I got to hear a little more at the same time

Hey, I'm from Vegas  I just got a quick thing for you guys  I was wondering why you bleeped me out when I wasn't swearing earlier  But, uh, you know that retarded song he played before the commercial?  We didn't even bleep you out  No, I mean, it was sounding like it  That wasn't me  I don't know what he's trying to say 
[00:49:30]  I don't either  Emma, what's going on?  You guys, I mean, come on  It's not a big stretch to think, you know  Here's Jose Feliciano singing the song  The Hispanics being in trouble with the law  It's not a big stretch  Not to mention  Did you hear me mixing the song?  I'm Fat Boy Opie over there  Joe's is hysterical  It makes me wet my pants  I think it's hilarious to hear him like that  All right  I mean, Joe's is way, way better  And, uh, you know  Don't get turned on, Norton  But it makes me wet my pants  Ooh, hey, I'm usually the first one to, uh 
[00:50:00]  Uh, critique Joe's songs  I like his better  Oh, this is absolutely hysterical  All right  We like Joe's, too  Thank you, Emma  So what?  It's a complete rip-off  I love the mix  It's so close  Mike from Jersey  Holy crap  Nice back and forth there, Opie  Thank you  Look at that  Thank you, thank you  Fat Boy Opie  All right, we have to take a break, huh?  Yeah  And we'll continue with more show  Opie

[00:51:30]  Gary Hoey's going to be helping us in and out of breaks today, Anthony.  Yeah.  He puts out these CDs every year.  Now this year he's got like a best of Ho Ho Hoey or something, right?  Yes, we took the three and kind of mixed all the best songs together,  like Mean One, Mr. Grinch, and his four brand new ones.  Can you play Mean One, Mr. Grinch?  I forgot.  You've got to hear this.  This is unbelievable.  Let's do that.  Yeah, just delay the whole goddamn thing.  We'll play a little Grinch for you.  Here we go.  All right.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:52:00]  Gary Hoey in the studio today.  Wow.  Some idiot on the line is saying,  is this like Days of the New?  I can't hear the vocals.  You idiot.  There are no vocals.  You know any Sabbath?  I love Sabbath.  You know any obscure Sabbath?  Like obscure?  Real obscure?  I don't know if I know obscure.  Under the sun?  Oh, man.  Look at you.  Look at you.  I love guys that play the guitar.  I love guys.  I know that one that goes...  What are you, a chick? 
[00:52:30]  I know that one that goes...  You love guys that play the guitar.  That's a chick.  Huh?  Is this the car around here?  Turn it up to the...  Oh, hold on.  The one that goes...  I mean, that was like...  That was the one that wanted to play in the garage, you know.  Is that what pitch?  Oh, blast.  The phone blast.  Oh, no!  Oh, God, help me, please!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That sounds like a satanic massacre going on.  First Saturday of a row.  Very nice.  Oh, I love that one.  Thank you, sir.  I was asking, who is this guy? 
[00:53:00]  Gary Hoey.  Yes.  Gary Ho-Ho-Ho.  Yeah, he's got Ho-Ho-Hoey CDs.  I swear to God.  Yeah, they're in the stores.  All the stores.  And you can also go to GaryHoey.com for free guitar lessons.  Danny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Real good.  I love that song.  Cool.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you guys that, you know what?  You disgust a nigga.  Wambos, wambos, wambos!  Wambos in my pants!  Wambos, wambos, wambos!  Wambos in my pants!  I don't get it.  Um, what? 
[00:53:30]  I didn't get that at all.  Did you get that, Anthony?  Like, I don't mind when they call up and have something to work with there, but that...  I didn't quite get that.  All right.  Well, whatever.  Mr. Hoey, do you do any Ozzy solo stuff?  Uh, yeah, I know this one.  Uh, where's the one that goes?  Where'd it go?  Hold on, I keep turning this.  Sorry, buddy.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'll walk the road.  Oh!  I actually got to audition for Ozzy when he was looking for a guitar player when he played  Zach Wilde.  Yeah.  I actually got in and played with the Oz man. 
[00:54:00]  It was fun.  He's going to want to drink from your meal.  It was so fun.  I'm serious.  I got to play with Ozzy, and he ran over to me, and he shook his hair at me, and he said,  go, go, go!  And he screamed at me, and I was doing, you know...  I was, like, playing all the songs.  It was really fantastic.  Did Joe Holmes got the job, though?  Is that what you...  Actually, it was Zach Wilde at the time.  You know, it was him, and I flew off from Boston.  Ozzy flew me out.  It was like my first big shot at anything.  It was really cool.  Because for me, I hitchhiked in the snow when I was 16 to go see Sabbath in Springfield, 
[00:54:30]  Massachusetts.  In the snow, me and my friends, we were right at the front of the stage at a GA show, and  I was holding Ozzy's mic, and the roadies were kicking my knuckles, and I was still holding  it.  You know, and then 20 years later, I got to try out for him.  It was the coolest thing.  That's amazing.  That rocks.  What did he say?  The reason was you didn't get it.  Well, they liked me.  They actually called me back the second day, and, you know, I mean, if you look at Zach,  I mean, he was born for that gig.  He had the blonde hair.  He was such a randy, you know, he was so close to Randy Rose.  Killer abs.  Had a six-pack.  I just came in with a six-pack, so, you know, I didn't get the gig. 
[00:55:00]  That is so great.  Yeah, it was fun.  Hello, Gary.  It's all the old boy.  You love the way you play the guitar.  It's fabulous.  It's fantastic.  I'm going to go with Zach because he has had a fixed helicopter.  Well, I'll just say, oh, yeah.  Well, Oz, it's good to hear from you again, man.  It's been a while.  Oh, it's great.  You're fantastic.  If anything happens to Zach, you're right here in line, just okay. 
[00:55:30]  And he's quite a boozer and a drugger, so I might be able to squeeze in there if he's  off dead or something.  Good, man.  He falls out of a helicopter.  I just like the way Ozzy says helicopter.  Well, I'll bring some banana pills to the next show.  Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Enough of the music.  I want my talk.  Shut up, you idiot.  I listen to Opie and Anthony for the talk.  Gary, you know what happened?  Let's talk more rock.  Yeah, wait till Gary does Hocus Pocus for us later on today. 
[00:56:00]  You know what?  He's actually goofing on us because when we first came here, it was a rock station, and  we got 20,000 calls every day that would say, shut up and play the music.  Oh, man.  Bastards.  Hey, Stalker Patty wants to come in and give us our annual Christmas gifts, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Who?  Stalker Patty.  Oh, Patty?  Yeah.  How are you?  Oh.  Do you know Symptom of the Universe?  Yeah.  All right, Jim.  Let's keep it on this planet for everyone else, all right? 
[00:56:30]  I mean, Barking the Moon was good enough.  That was phenomenal.  For everyone.  Thanks.  Hey, you got you some Christmas presents.  Now, Stalker Patty, I think everyone's pretty familiar with her, but she's a pathetic sort.  Um, broke.  Broke is dirt.  Yet she insists on making us Christmas presents or something.  The past few years we've been here, every Christmas she brings something in, which Opie  smashes right in front of her face and is really horrid.  Last year she cried really bad.  And she cried really bad, yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Well, she makes things that look like your third grader brought it home.  It's like, look what I made you.  I spray-painted a picture frame gold and I glued some macaroni to it.  And I shellacked some magazine cutouts of your favorite cartoon characters.  That's great, Patty.  Smash!  Smash!  Last year it was our penthouse article.  Yeah, she did.  That she, uh, that she copied.  And I got a glue gun with some colored glue and I wrote your names on it and glued the macaroni 
[00:57:30]  on it.  It was decoupage.  And the macaroni was my dinner for last night, so I really made the sick refuse.  Now, Patty, we haven't seen you in a few weeks.  Can you take your wig off for Gary Hoey?  Yeah, let's see how the hair's growing in.  Do you know about me getting my hair?  Gary, we had to shave our heads for U2 tickets.  She loves U2.  So in order to get the tickets, we made her shave her head.  She thought it was going to grow back by Thanksgiving.  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:00]  Here it is.  It is grown.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It looks hip short like that.  It looks hip like that.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Please get into the box, because you will be kept together when you get to the family camp.  You will be kept together and rejoined with your family at the family camp.  Please just get on the box car.  I understand what you look like, Patty.  Now I have banks, and I can clip it, and then I'll safely go off. 
[00:58:30]  And then I'll save it for good memories.  You don't need the wheel.  Put your clothing in a large pile to the left.  You will be given clothing, but your clothing will be given back to you when you leave the family camp.  Jim, you ever hear the song, Camp Concentration?  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That was for our most offensive song contest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Patty.  Yes?  Your hair doesn't seem to be growing back.  You thought by Christmas you were going to have a... 
[00:59:00]  Flowing locks.  When did we cut it?  We cut it in October.  October 23rd.  October 23rd.  It's almost two months.  Well, so I over-projected.  Over-projected.  I was optimistic.  What can I say?  I was very optimistic.  It's growing at a normal rate.  It's half an inch a month average.  I looked it up.  Oh, you looked it up?  Yeah.  But I went to the...  It'll grow faster now than after it actually all comes in because the roots are... 
[00:59:30]  It's all new hair.  Have you tried calling the hair club for U2 ticket fans?  Yeah.  It could give you a weave or something.  Hair club for ants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doesn't she have the body of an ant, Gary?  We said she has the body of an ant.  Actually, she looks a lot like one of my ants.  I cut off my antennae.  All right, Patty.  What did you bring us this year?  What did you bring us?  A little Christmas...  It's a little...  Oh, it's in a bag from Godiva Chiklits. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Wow, a real gift this year.  What is it?  Godiva stuff.  Where's the...  No, I see something homemade looking in there.  What is that?  Here's the homemade thing.  What did...  It's all the cities.  Syndication now.  There's always some homemade thing.  If you notice the numbers on the radio, it corresponds to all the cities.  I had to do about a week of research to get around.  So you did a week of research.  When you've got no life, it's easy to find things to do.  Well, you know, it kept me busy.  Well, and once you describe this, I'll hand it over to you.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  Let me see.  Looks like something your third grader would bring home to you.  Every time.  I told you she does this, and I had no clue.  I don't think Gart is one of my talents, but the thought is in the heart.  So far, oh, stop.  The thought's in the brain.  $1.50, $1.50 I see for the little canvas item.  The 8x10 canvas item, which she then got...  This looks like nail polish.  No, it's paint pens.  Paint pens.  And she drew what looks like a radio. 
[01:01:00]  Is that what it's supposed to be?  I patterned it after my boom box.  Yeah, I have a little radio that looks like that.  Boom box.  I put it in front of me and drill it.  Too bad you couldn't have drawn a black guy raping you and stealing a spell.  Yeah, how about the one that I heard before with the chocolate something?  Let me be a chocolate man.  Let me be a chocolate man.  It doesn't sound like a chocolate man.  She's got a Chicago, Dallas, Columbus, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Portland, Houston, Philadelphia, 
[01:01:30]  Cleveland, Sacramento, Seattle, Houston, Buffalo, Los Angeles, and New York.  She can't speak.  So, Patty, how long did it take you to make this?  Oh, no.  This is always how it's done.  I went in, what, for about three days.  Three days.  But you researched it for a week, right?  Well, I had to find a way to get a copy of the open stations along, but I didn't remember 
[01:02:00]  the wall.  Can I take a real quick look?  I took me a few days to find it.  You better take a look now, because I don't think...  Mine's...  My paper's out there.  What do you have a pager for?  Well, you could bring it in with you, and it's not going to ring.  Who the hell pages you?  Well, and some nice stuff from Good Dive at Chocolate.  Good...  You were talking about coffee and stuff, so I thought I'd let you try some really good stuff.  Chicholet.  That's actually very nice.  What kind of chicholet did you...  Shut up, Gordon.  It is.  It's so full of crap.  No, I'm not.  It's actually got a little AM and an FM and all the numbers and the little green lines 
[01:02:30]  like radio things.  Well, you can tell that she put a lot of...  You're actually really confident in this.  How much did you have the ink pens around, or did you have to buy them?  Well, I had to go get them.  I had to blame.  How much did the whole thing cost you, would you say?  I don't know.  Why did it take you a week to research it when you could just go on the internet and find  out all the cities where...  I don't have...  Internet.  Opie, slow down.  He did.  I was adding up the cost of the pens on my yippicus.  So how did you figure it out?  Did you call just every city in America and ask if they have Opie and Anthony? 
[01:03:00]  Hey, hey, do you ever be an Anthony here?  When I went to give Ron and Fez their little Christmas wishes, I finally hooked up with  the girl from the night crew here who works at night, and she was very nice.  She went and did it for me and had it the next morning.  Oh, sorry.  I was sleeping.  So, uh...  Here you go.  I'll take a closer look.  Oh, I don't want to give it to him.  That's actually nice.  All right.  Well, you wait until you see how nice.  No, be nice to her.  That's nice.  It's very nice.  Yeah, the syndication now, a little radio with all the dial positions. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, no.  You wish you'd do the little things in there?  Oh, shut up.  Oh, no.  Hey.  How'd you make the radio?  I just threw it free form.  Yeah, free form.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Hey.  Merry Christmas.  What are you doing for Christmas, Patty?  What are your Christmas plans?  Well, the same friends that I spend it with every year, I'm going to spend it with them  this year.  Yeah, what cemetery are they at? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, stop.  No?  Oh, they're living people?  They're living people.  Wow, I can't even imagine that.  And you go there, and what happens?  How many people are there?  Set the scene for me.  It's usually like his whole family's there.  Yeah.  His?  Ooh.  A little romance?  Yeah, yeah.  A little romance between you two?  No.  Oh.  Who is it?  It's him and his wife and all their relatives.  Is it Reynolds Joseph from 1010 Winds?  No.  Here in New York?  No?  I like your gifts.  Oh, God.  See, I'm trying to distract him, but he's not getting distracted. 
[01:04:30]  No, I really like this one.  So you go there, Patty, and do you exchange gifts?  Yeah.  Do you give them gifts that you make?  Well, yeah, I just make little baskets, and I put them together.  You weave baskets.  It's, boy, really busting those stereotypes apart.  No, I just have to step up with little things here and there, like little candles, little  soaps, coffees, and stuff.  Keefies. 
[01:05:00]  Patty, this is very sturdy.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Why didn't you put it in a frame, Patty?  Well.  Why didn't you put it in a frame?  Well.  No.  Why?  Be honest.  Why?  She ran out of money.  You ran out of money?  I didn't get around to getting a frame.  Oh, we were special in the old days.  You're so special.  Opie, no, don't bet.  Opie, Opie, stop.  No, no.  What?  I'm not doing anything.  He's bending it.  Oh, don't tap it. 
[01:05:30]  He's sizing it up.  He is sizing it up.  It's like the way killer whales play with the seals in the water before they bite their  effing heads off.  Oh, God.  No, stop it.  No, no, dude.  Don't.  No, don't.  You can't.  Patty.  Patty.  You can't.  What?  Oh, you want a picture of that?  That's nice.  Give me a shot of that.  That's very nice.  There you go.  There's the before shot.  Yes.  I mean, there's the shot.  There's the shot.  No, you can't do it.  I spent a lot of time in the colony making this. 
[01:06:00]  Looks like you spent a lot of money on the paint.  It's paint pens, Opie.  Paint pens.  It's special paint, though.  Yeah.  Oh, gee, no.  Opie.  I think I saw it.  I think I saw it, Ben.  It's beginning to give.  It's starting to give.  I really worked on that.  Fuck.  What?  Nice.  Opie, she worked on it, man.  Of course she did.  You put a lot of time into that.  No, no.  Look, it's going to go.  Stop it.  Oh, no.  No.  Ben's hitting his ass.  See, Ben hit my hand.  That's not nice, Patty, right?  Is the paint cracking? 
[01:06:30]  Stop.  No, you're going to break it in half.  Opie, don't.  Opie, stop it.  No, she worked hard on it.  You can't break it.  Oh, my God.  It's at a 90-degree angle.  It's nice, Patty.  Thank you.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, I can't.  I can't.  Oh, no.  Oh, you are horrible.  He's crazy.  He's a forgive.  Oh, my God.  He's ripping it.  It's like a phone book. 
[01:07:00]  I know.  Well, he can tear those up.  I need scissors.  Oh, God.  Oh, my heart.  Oh, my.  Look, Rachel's disgusted with you.  Wait, how convenient, Ben?  Oh, God.  God damn you.  Oh, no.  I need your help.  Patty.  I appreciated it, Patty.  I thought it was very nice.  You worked hard on that.  I thought it was nice.  Oh, are you getting upset?  No.  No. 
[01:07:30]  He's nuts.  Patty, I've got to ask you something.  And you have to seriously answer me.  Yeah.  You've been bringing stuff.  He looks like a troubled child.  Yeah.  Believe me.  You've been bringing stuff for various occasions for over three years since we've been here.  Yeah.  For birthdays, Christmas, all kinds of occasions, you bring stuff that you make in here.  Yeah.  Every single time what you bring in gets destroyed. 
[01:08:00]  Why do you continue to do it?  Well, I don't know.  What makes you make stuff knowing when you're making it?  Do you see how it's going to end?  We all know how it is going to end.  Oh, I know.  So why do you make it?  I have to keep finding tougher materials to make stuff out of them.  Wow.  All right.  Improvise, adapt, overcome.  He did better bring an alternative thing.  Like for Valentine's Day, he broke the heart balloon I gave them. 
[01:08:30]  I'm convinced if you...  And I had his name on it, too.  I'm convinced if you made something out of solid steel, Opie would wheel in an acetylene  torch and cut it to pieces just to piss you off.  Patty?  I don't get a PO.  When you're making it, what are you thinking when you're working on this and making it?  I'm thinking how special this is.  This is an important moment for them.  You dick. 
[01:09:00]  Patty, you've got to learn.  What are you doing with the chocolates?  Oh, please don't, guys.  No.  No.  He's pulling his fly down.  What are you doing with your junk?  Those look really good.  What are you doing?  Oh, is he going to take a leak on her?  She was not talking about that, Sean.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Are you taking a leak on her, Preston?  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:09:30]  You can't see.  Oh, oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that is not right.  Oh, man.  I watched him.  He didn't really do anything.  You are.  You've got to be nice, though.  Bing, yes.  I should have thought into things.  I know.  Now, she put thought into things.  You should have put thought into your life about 40 years ago. 
[01:10:00]  Jesus, Patty.  You think you'll lose your virginity this new year?  The upcoming 2002 coming up?  I have to meet the right person.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Dude, are you taking...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Patty is taking a leak on your presence.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jesus.  You had to say, I saw him. 
[01:10:30]  He didn't really do it.  Can I have one?  Patty.  Hey, Gary, how about a Christmas song?  I heard the piddle of it hitting the gift.  What's your name, love?  Patty.  What's your name, love?  Patty.  Are you okay?  Patty, are you okay?  Oh, no.  Patty, are you all right? 
[01:11:00]  At least...  Oh, Patty, don't forget...  Oh, she's getting upset.  At least we still have the coffee.  Oh, is there coffee?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We'll make a pot.  I'd like some coffee, I can't.  Play the music.  What?  Oh, my God.  Coffee.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  I see her lip shaking.  Did that upset you, Patty?  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  What happened, Patty?  Oh.  You're special. 
[01:11:30]  I just want to let you know.  Opie is very heartless.  Oh, my God.  He's crying.  He really did it.  She's crying.  It wasn't even ripping it off.  It was opening up the chocolates and taking a leak.  You took a leak on a present.  The love she wanted to show for you, and you took a leak on it.  You are horrible.  Oh.  But it makes me happy, Patty.  Isn't that what Christmas is all about?  I guess Gary Hoey is horrified at what he has seen. 
[01:12:00]  Really uncomfortable.  It's Christmas.  Christmas at the O&A show.  Wow.  Well, I figure she keeps coming back.  You know, maybe she likes it.  Yeah, that's all we can think.  Oh, boy.  Do you have a song that will cheer everybody up?  Maybe a Christmas tune called Hang Yourself on the 24th, Aunt Bonnie?  Well, oh, my God.  Opie, people so pissed off at you. 
[01:12:30]  What?  Jen from New York saying, Patty, stand up for yourself and shove those effing leaked on chocolates  down Opie's throat.  No.  Oh, I like the heart one.  You make the Grinch look like frigging Santa Claus Opie.  Little heart.  Yeah, well, who's going to eat it?  Thank you, Patty.  You are so twisted.  He's standing there, and he got the...  I looked over, and he got, like, the stage fright that you get in the bathroom sometimes, 
[01:13:00]  but he's just concentrating and then...  And he starts giggling.  And then he's laughing as it trickles down on Patty's gift.  Little...  I have no gift to bring, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Well, thank you, Patty.  I'll buy some paint pens, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  He's nuts.  I'll throw a radio, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, pa-pum-pum-pum, pa-pum-pum-pum. 
[01:13:30]  I'll be leaks on it, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Boy, am I dumb.  Patty, this one's enjoyable.  Well, thank you.  Oh, come on, you faithful, tinkle in my presence.  This one's good.  It's not so bad.  Well, that one...  Patty, that one, um...  That one didn't get, you know what, on, so...  There you go.  Thank you. 
[01:14:00]  For it is to laugh and sing in a sleigh and swing tonight.  Oh, tinkle bells, tinkle bells, tinkle on my gift.  Oh, did you read the card?  Oh, jeez, you had to bring that up.  That might have survived.  All right, here's the card.  Let me read it.  Wait, get the music for the card.  Read it as Stalker Patty.  Of course.  It could be any other way.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  It's always a novel.  Here we go.  Oh, be Anthony, Rick, Rachel, Mary, Stinky, Ben, et cetera. 
[01:14:30]  No Jim Norton.  I'm sorry.  Oh, damn, Patty.  I couldn't think of everybody.  I just, that's why I put et cetera.  Jim, you're included, too.  Jim's forgettable.  Yeah, not school, who cares?  And it's a little card, and on the front is a plate with a fork, knife, and spoon around it.  A dinner plate and a festive Christmas napkin.  And in the plate are peas, green peas.  And they're arranged as if it's the countries of the Earth on the plate representing the planet. 
[01:15:00]  And it says, peas on earthenware.  I get it.  Look, she's giggling like a retard.  Go figure.  What an interesting and fun year it's been.  I got to have my head shaped, and so you, too, as a result.  Had beer thrown at me, and posed for a whipped cream bikini contest, among other things.  If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have a life full of the fun things I experienced this year with you all. 
[01:15:30]  Have a dearly, dearly day, and a great new year.  I love you all, Patty.  Patty, enjoy your much-deserved vaculation.  Well, thank you, Patty.  You're welcome.  I just wanted to give you holiday wishes for the year.  Off the instant feedback, Anthony.  Opie, that's not good hygiene. 
[01:16:00]  That's not good hygiene.  You can't twinkle in my gif.  Tinkle, buzz, tinkle, buzz.  All right, we got to go and take a break.  So, thank you, Stalker Patty.  Thank you.  It was just another great Christmas moment with Patty.  We got to put them all together.  We got to do that one.  We should put them all on one CD.  Put them all together.  Patty's Christmas moments.  God, can we find all the Christmas moments?  We got to have them all.  We have three Christmas moments.  We have three Valentine's Days. 
[01:16:30]  All Valentine's Days.  We got the birthday gifts.  Yeah.  You can call it the stalker stuffing.  It was weird when I gave them a balloon shaped like a heart right away.  Bang.  Bang.  Unfortunately, that wasn't a gunshot with it pointed at your skull.  All right, Gary Hoey in the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  He's got a best of Hoey CD out with all his Christmas songs from the last three albums.  Yeah.  And you're going to jam us to break here?  Absolutely.  Let's see a little Carol of the Bells.  Patty of the Bells.  Okay.  Gary Hoey, everyone. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Gary Hoey playing live in the studio for us today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ho, ho, hoey.  He's got a lot of CDs on the market.  His latest one is the greatest hits of the last three he did.  All Christmas songs.  And Kevin from the Bronx writes,  How are we supposed to download, I mean, oops, buy his albums if you don't spell his last name right? 
[01:17:30]  Bastards.  Well, the phone's just exploding, huh?  Let's take a couple of these.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I got one thing to say about what you did to Patty's present.  Yeah.  You bastard.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hilarious.  They don't think it's hilarious on the instant feedback.  No.  People think you're a heartless bastard. 
[01:18:00]  Especially the newer cities, Anthony, that really don't fully understand the Stalker Patty thing yet.  Yeah.  But thank you.  Todd, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right, Todd.  Oh, man.  Best cringe radio ever.  Sounded like somebody was raking their nails on a chalkboard the whole time I was listening, dude.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to listen to.  Love you here in Cleveland.  Norton rules.  Norton does rule.  Oh, we should put his mic on, though.  Thank you, Todd.  Thank you.  All right.  And finally, Billy. 
[01:18:30]  Billy, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  That is the sickest, cruelest thing I have ever heard, dude.  But I loved it.  I laughed my ass off.  Hey, and Pat, I'm sorry that Opie tinkled on your present.  That's pretty good, though.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, man.  It's always fun to see the reaction of someone that doesn't know the whole scene.  Like, Gary Hoey's looking on like, oh, my God.  What did I get myself into today? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, well, when she took her wig off, I knew we were in for a ride.  It was like a good moment.  Good point.  She keeps coming back some more.  And the weird thing is, she thought her hair would grow back by New Year's Eve.  Uh-uh.  By Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving, she said.  Oh, it had to be good by Thanksgiving.  Right.  And then she changed it to New Year's Eve.  You had to scrub the pans with.  She thought originally Thanksgiving.  And then I'm like, no, no, no.  It's going to be New Year's Eve.  Because she said, oh, where are you working?  I said, oh, the fun house in Poughkeepsie.  Oh, God.  Oh, you whore.  Wow, did you whore that plug in there. 
[01:19:30]  I didn't even see it coming.  Whoa.  Wow.  That nailed me.  You whore.  No, I just got to mention this fun house gig in Poughkeepsie.  Why don't you mention your website while you're at it?  Yeah.  Listen to the name of his website.  Well, the fun house number is area code 845-838-5331.  Phone numbers never work on the radio.  I know they don't.  But it's the fun house, so come and we'll have some fun.  At the fun house.  Some chuckles.  The website is up now.  There's a couple more things going to go on it, like a little bit of audio stuff. 
[01:20:00]  It's just starting.  Yeah.  It's eatabullet.com.  Eatabullet.com.  One word.  Now, that's a website address.  I got to thank real quick.  I like that.  I got to thank all the people that offered to do them for me, but the guys that actually  did it.  And I'm not, you know, I didn't have to plug them on the air.  Accurate Imaging in Jersey.  Matt and those guys.  I'm probably going to give out their number, too.  It's area code 201-287-9300.  These guys are phenomenal.  And thank you.  Oh, my God.  More phone numbers.  Look at your frigging front page. 
[01:20:30]  It's got eatabullet spelt out in, like, cutout newspaper things.  Police don't cross tape.  And I see a girl's ankles bound over here in the corner.  This just looks, this is frightening.  They did a great job with it.  Phenomenal.  So far, so good.  It looks great.  Oh, wow.  Well, Anthony.  I didn't know Tom Brokaw was stopping by today.  No, I didn't either.  I think, oh, the liquor ads. 
[01:21:00]  Ah, that's right.  NBC.  NBC has decided to run liquor ads, Anthony.  Yeah.  This has been a no-no for many, many, many years on TV.  Booze on television.  Booze ads on TV.  They banned hard liquor ads 30 years ago.  On TV.  They used to have them on?  Yeah.  A long, long time ago.  One of the cigarette commercials coming back.  That's got to be next.  How could they bring back the booze ads without the butt ads?  That'd be something. 
[01:21:30]  Well, they got the cigarette ads.  The anti-cigarette ads.  Yeah, I know.  I like the one where the two guys are taking a leak.  Which one's that?  The two guys.  On Daddy's Gift?  Two guys in the bathroom hitting camera, and then the guy looks down at the little cake,  and it says, uh, uh, uh, uh, your urine contains urethra.  Oh, oh, that thing.  Or something like that.  The ammonia, and then it's also found in cigarettes.  Yeah, great.  Like you're drinking from a mule when you, uh, smoke a cigarette.  But, uh, they're going to start, well, they have started to run, uh, hard liquor ads on NBC. 
[01:22:00]  Hmm.  Decision by NBC to accept advertising for liquor is shockingly irresponsible and should be reversed immediately.  Says, uh, American Medical Association chairman.  Um, they're worried about, uh, the kids again.  Of course.  It's always the children.  It's the at-risk children ages 10 to 15 who watch TV at night.  No, they say you can't put the crap on in the day, and then they say it's the children 10 to 15 that watch at night. 
[01:22:30]  Because the ads aren't going to run, uh, during the day.  They're going to run at night, and they're all going to feature, um, actors that are over 30 years old.  Over 30, yeah.  So it's not like, uh, going to the, to the kids.  Yeah, but there are 30-year-olds that look like they're, uh, 14, 15.  Good.  They should show them drinking in geranimals.  So sick of hearing about people's kids.  Geranimals.  Let's see what, uh, Mothers Against Drunk Driving said.  We have no guarantee that time, that, what time young people are going to be watching TV. 
[01:23:00]  So they must be strict with their guidelines at any time of the day.  I once showed a frog to my three-year-old nephew, and he said, Budweiser.  That's a little scary, she says.  Because of the frog commercial.  Budweiser.  Oh, stop it.  Uh, it says in this article as well, Ant, television has long been the final frontier for hard booze ads.  And until now, all the major networks adhere to a self-imposed ban against advertising distilled spirits. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  So they could have advertised this, uh, for the last 30 years.  They just chose not to.  There's no law against it.  I, uh, applaud NBC.  Yep.  They saw a niche, and they're going for it.  I don't think we'll be doing that.  Tell you the truth.  That means they need money bad.  400, let's see.  Like, the numbers are down.  Suddenly, I'm going to tap into a market in which advertisers spend about 400 million annually.  Wow.  Wow.  Who's going to advertise?  Let's see. 
[01:24:00]  Commercial with Smirno Vodka.  Also, uh, Guinness, whose labels include Johnny Walker Scotch, Seagram's VO, Tanger Agent, and Gordon's Vodka.  And if you're worried about your kids, can't you just be better parents?  I'm so, if your kid's watching TV too late, turn it off, you fat-hipped suburban zilch.  I'm so tired of people.  The mother has to work so they can have the minivan and the thing.  Be better parents.  I don't care about your kids.  I'm so tired of it. 
[01:24:30]  I'm tired of it.  Doesn't it come down to, if the ads are on TV, uh, you know, the parents, it gives them opportunities to maybe talk with their children.  And say, hey, uh, don't drink the booze.  You'll end up like daddy.  Exactly.  Or something like that.  Exactly.  You know?  When your father's drinking and punching your mother in the eye because the bitch brought out cold meatloaf, that's the problem.  It's not NBC showing some stupid ad.  They chopped my Comedy Central set to pieces.  I can't say I banged a deformed girl because kids might be watching. 
[01:25:00]  They really did that to you?  Yeah, of course they did.  That's why the comments about Comedy Central?  I don't dislike Comedy Central.  They're actually good, but just the way they chopped that set made me want to vomit.  Ah.  The kids might watch.  It doesn't make sense because then they show South Park where Butters walks in.  Yep.  And you can tell two guys are having, uh, the, the B-sex, Anthony.  Yeah.  They know.  The B, the B-sex.  Oh, we all knew it was B-sex.  They say because it's on later, but that's not true.  And that it's a cartoon. 
[01:25:30]  It's only a cartoon.  That's it.  That's the mentality.  We got to play the thing from, uh, Conan O'Brien, Tom Brokaw talking about, uh, his drinking habits.  Oh, listen to this.  This is, now, now, the thing is, Tom Brokaw, as, as we've, uh, stated here and, and mocked,  uh, has a, a very horrible speech impediment for a guy that's on the, one of the network anchors.  He can't say the letter L.  And he has problems with R's, too.  He says L like this.  He can't say L.  So he's talking, listen the way he, he goes to say 9 o'clock in this clip. 
[01:26:00]  He says he got home about 9 o'clock, he was going to say.  But he goes 9 o, and then realized he has trouble with that L,  so he changed it in mid-string.  Yeah, listen to that.  Listen to what I'm saying.  This is great.  Adrenaline is a very strong drug.  I, you know, I was pumped up.  And I would go home and sleep very little and wake up.  How do you even get to sleep if you're obviously that pumped up?  Well, the first night I went home, um, I would, I came on the air at 9, about 9.15 in the morning  with Kate, uh, Katie and Matt on the Today Show, and then just stayed on until about 2 in the morning, went home. 
[01:26:30]  And, uh, you know, it was fair to say that I was wired, so I thought the way to deal with this  is with a big water glass full of scotch.  And, um...  This is a good message for the young people out there.  Oh, don't give me that condescending crap going on, Brian.  It is a great message for the young people.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:27:00]  NBC, the first network to begin airing booze ad.  Well, it's about f***ing time.  I've been drinking at the Anchor Desk now for years, and now I'd like to do some live, some  reads during the portion of my program that is not on tape.  That would be a lot, a lot, a lot, live.  Hello, Tom Brokaw for Johnny Walker Red.  It doesn't have an L in it. 
[01:27:30]  What the hell?  That's the selling point.  Hey, I'm doing shots with John the Intern.  Are ya?  Bring him in.  Yeah?  Holiday parties.  I love it.  You were at our Christmas party?  I didn't even know.  I was.  I was doing shots of...  I had gold shalala...  Gold shalala...  Gold shalala...  I had some shots with gold in it.  It was wonderful.  I drank so much, I swear to God, I started vomiting, and I puked myself deaf. 
[01:28:00]  And the next day, wreck you, pussy.  You know what?  I think it'll be a great thing if me and that son-of-a-bitch Dan Rather co-anchor one night  and play quarters.  Could you imagine that?  Just dink, dink, do a shot.  Uh-oh, you f***ing cursed, Stan.  Oh, no, now I said, f***.  No pointing.  Just use your elbows. 
[01:28:30]  Look, you said, f***.  If Steve C pinches my ass one more time, that faggot.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'm hammered.  Gonna do some cake stands, Tom.  I'm doing cake stands with Katie Couric.  And she's gonna do a funnel shot and get a cololacopee at the same time. 
[01:29:00]  What a great segment that was.  Katie Couric.  I've asked her many times, hey, what's up, you're at?  You know who's an angry drunk?  Who?  That big fat owl, owl the weatherman.  We don't know that for sure, Tom, do we?  I do.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's drunk and he likes a fondle boy.  You don't know that.  Of course I don't.  I'm a character like Mr. Imus does. 
[01:29:30]  So, there you have it.  Booze ads.  I'm all for it.  You like the booze ads.  Yes, I like, I like having a absolute, absolute vodka martini.  God damn it, with my L's.  How did I get this far in broadcasting when I can't even say L?  Fighting today in Jalalaba, Jalalaba, Jalalaba, in Afghanistan. 
[01:30:00]  Hello?  This guy's talking to himself.  What, Jim?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, yo, yeah, I just got back from a doctor's appointment a little while ago.  Yeah.  I thought you guys would appreciate this.  Yeah.  So, yeah, so.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Jim.  Yeah, I'm here.  What's the problem?  Who's in the background going, who's coaching you?  That's my brother.  He's been a jerk.  So, anyway.  Is this going to be a fake phone call?  No, this is 100% true.  I'm not lying to you, fellas.  I love you guys.  I'll never lie to you. 
[01:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  I loved you in Little Nicky, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  About three weeks ago, I got a phone call.  Sounds like a sailor.  Excuse me?  Go ahead, Jim.  Okay.  About three weeks ago, I got a phone call from this girl who I didn't know.  She said it.  Hey, Jim.  Jim.  Jim.  Jim.  You realize you just wrecked the whole Tom Brokaw bit, right?  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Go ahead, though.  I'm sorry.  Because I'm sure this is so much better than what Anthony.  Uh, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You can't put it that way. 
[01:31:00]  You can say you were eating her.  I'm sorry.  I performed oral.  I just said, leave it right there.  We know what it is.  Yeah, that's great.  Okay.  Our listener is very smart, Jim.  There we go.  How about that?  All right.  All right.  Okay.  So then, just now, three weeks later, I began this funny feeling in the back of my throat  like I got a hairball.  Uh-oh.  And I look in the mirror, and it looked like the back of my tongue was dissolving.  I got this pus hanging off the back of my hangy ball thing.  That thing in the back of your throat? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I go to the doctor.  Wait, wait.  You had, like, moss growing from it?  That's exactly what it looked like.  Yeesh.  I go to the doctors today.  I had three doctors look at me.  They came to conclude.  They made my mom leave.  Then they talked to me if I had a, if I did that to a girl lately.  I said, yeah, they tell me I have a yeast infection in my mouth.  Can you get one of those?  Apparently, I have it right now.  You must have dove in there head first.  I was in there, Norton.  I was in there, man.  Now, let me ask you something. 
[01:32:00]  Was there some kind of, some odor that would have let you know this was going on?  Not at all.  I was clueless.  Okay.  We need a doctor to call and tell us if this is possible.  Okay.  I think Jim is pulling our leg in.  No, I swear to God.  He said it's a fungal infection.  It most likely happened from that girl.  Fungal infection.  Are you finding croissants in your throat?  What did they give you?  Antibiotics?  No, they gave me an antifungal.  Micelex.  Antifungal.  It's acting in your mouth.  Yeah, I have to suck on it. 
[01:32:30]  I have to suck on it like candy.  Ah.  Well, that's a cute little story today.  Well, good luck with you.  Thank you.  I thought you felt like that.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  And you rock.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Well, you're coming to Philly soon.  Yes, Anthony?  Skinny from Boston says, if you play the Brokaw clip over and listen carefully, he says,  I stayed up very, and then stops.  He never says late, because he can't say it late.  Oh, we can listen to that again.  You haven't?  Let me hear Brokaw again.  Adrenaline is a very strong drug.  I, you know, I was pumped up, and I would go home and sleep very little and wake up. 
[01:33:00]  Or even get to sleep if you're up.  He says very low.  Very low.  He threw that one in.  Very low.  Slept very low.  Well...  Stop that and play it again there, Johnny.  Adrenaline is a very strong drug.  Oh, I...  You know, I was pumped up, and I would go home and sleep very little and wake up.  How do you even get to...  How do you smell a little?  Very low.  Well, I was pumped up.  I was all hopped up on crack cocaine.  No scotch. 
[01:33:30]  Yes, I needed the scotch to take the edge off, because I did some crack cocaine.  I was speedballing.  I love that.  And then I needed to take the edge off with some scotch.  And then I called up some hookers, and I plowed them all night.  And now...  So I finally got to sleep.  And now you've got a yeast infection on your...  I have a yeast infection on the back of my throat.  I was doing the news, and I noticed on the copy there was this green pus coming out all  over the copy.  Oh, God.  And I said, what the... 
[01:34:00]  Did that chick have in her...  It turns out it was a yeast infection.  My God.  Her...  Looked like a erupting volcano.  Should have known something was wrong.  Smelt like brie.  But I didn't care.  Rather wants to get anthrax, I'll get a yeast infection in my mouth.  See who gets better rating.  I don't care. 
[01:34:30]  I'll eat the...  Of a goddamn crack whore hooker.  I'll tap that.  Give me a Haitian AIDS patient, and I'll...  Her right in the...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'll do it.  And I'll go home and down some scotch.  Yeah.  And shoot heroin.  Yeah.  Right into my retina.  You really get off that way.  How did we start this?  I don't know.  Liquor ads on TV.  Ah. 
[01:35:00]  Liquor?  Yeah, that's right.  I like...  You love liquor?  I don't care.  I like when they have open wounds.  I like that.  I start at the toes, work my way up, and I like if I have to pass 20 open oozing sores before I get to the...  Because, you know, when the legs are bad, that is really going to be awful.  And I'll catch some kind of disease that will beat out Rather and his damn anthrax. 
[01:35:30]  My assistant gets anthrax sent to her.  Rather gets it sent right to him.  Piss me off.  I can say that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Tom.  Laura!  Yeah?  What's up?  Hey, I was wondering when you're going to have What the Hell is That back on again.  We could have, you know, like that kid come in with the fuzz grown on his uvula.  Yeah, I don't think I want to see that.  No, I don't want to see that.  We will do What the Hell is That again.  It's sort of the same thing as when babies get thrush in their mouth.  It's sort of the same thing.  Thrush?  What's a thrush? 
[01:36:00]  Thrushed.  It's like white spots on the inside of a baby's mouth.  No, it's not baby and thrust.  Thrushed, idiot.  It's thrust.  Thrushed, you pig.  That's great.  That was Norton, Laura.  Of course it was Norton.  All right.  Of course it was Norton.  But I was trying to get through to you guys on that day.  Well, we'll do it again.  I had a question for the doctors.  Why?  You have a problem?  Well, no, it's actually, it's wonderful.  What is it?  I have this ability to, my boyfriend just calls me Puddles. 
[01:36:30]  You know?  Ah, okay.  All right.  That's enough said.  Enough said.  We know exactly what you do.  You get to that moment and there's a reaction that Puddles.  Where does it come from?  It's like Old Faithful.  Oh, my.  It's incredible.  Oh.  Yeah.  Where does that come from?  Ah, interesting.  That I want to ask a doctor.  What, you know.  Well, we'll ask a doctor, Laura.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  That is so hot.  You know something?  There goes Puddles.  That is disgusting, by the way.  No, I love Puddles.  You don't need that. 
[01:37:00]  I, I, it amounts to somebody wetting your bed.  Dude.  Is what it is.  I dated a girl once and, and when performing treats.  Once, huh?  All the rest would go.  And when performing treats.  And that time came, it would honestly, you would hear.  And you would feel like a water gun.  Was that the knife being plunged in her chest from you, you sick bastard?  Dude, you would feel it on your chin.  Oh, God.  I went bananas.  There was a spot, literally, probably a, the whole mattress was, oh, it was the greatest. 
[01:37:30]  The greatest.  And you put the diaper back on and put her back in her crib, you twisted bastard.  I know.  You sick.  I don't know what it was, but it smelled like formula.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Oh, there's nothing right today.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Steve, what's up?  The best to all.  Steve.  Hello.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Are you really, are you really a doctor or are you just playing on the radio?  I'll make this quick note. 
[01:38:00]  Steve, as far as you know, first year resident working in the ER in New Jersey.  Real quick.  Yes, it's possible to get a yeast infection in your mouth.  And yes, I can top that.  All right.  How?  We had a county jail here.  Inmate came into the ER.  Corrections guys brought him in from the county jail with an inspection around his colostomy.  Oh, God.  And it was found to be gonorrhea.  Oh, my God.  Who's the mayor?  Have a nice day, guys.  Somebody was having sex with the colostomy. 
[01:38:30]  Why not?  It's a hole?  God damn.  That's awful.  Say you're in a rush.  You're busy.  He was, why not?  It's a hole.  Oh.  I thought colostomy was the name of one of the prisoners.  See you?  Yo, colostomy, get over here.  Yeah, get colostomy.  All right.  I'll tap that side.  Anthony, people want to hear Ding Fries Are Done Again.  Oh, yeah.  God damn, how long have we been playing this?  It's a long time.  Oh, it brings back memories of Christmases from years and years past, Opie, when we used 
[01:39:00]  to play this every year.  So check this out?  Yeah.  And, well, we'll come back, because we have to have Gary Hoey take us a break, right,  Ann?  Mm-hmm.  So just check this out, okay?

I wanted to ask Norton about that girl he was talking about that flowed like a river.  Yeah.  Was she Irish by any chance? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, God, dude, I really don't know.  It's been years, and she wasn't even somebody that I knew that well.  She was somebody that was staying for the summer.  And thank God she didn't have dental records or he'd be in jail.  No, she was actually, to be perfectly honest, she was, I believe, from New Hampshire,  and I don't remember what nationality it was because she was there for a summer.  Oh.  Why do you think you might know her?  Well, Eric wants to say that Irish girls are notorious for this.  Oh, I am.  From my experience, from my experience, I've noticed that mainly Irish girls,  and I've asked other guys, too.  Are you sure they're not just drunk and wetting themselves? 
[01:41:00]  Which would be acceptable as well.  All right.  All right, Eric.  All right, guys, take it easy.  Bye.  And then let's go to Annie real fast, and I think we have to take a break.  Annie, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Great.  How are you?  Good.  I don't know.  I'm sure you guys would definitely appreciate this, if you noticed it.  But every time I watch Comedy Central and they put that Guinness ad on,  that Guinness strapped ad,  I always see the beginning with the spaceship.  What does that look like to you guys? 
[01:41:30]  It looks like a widget, a spaceship.  It looks like a giant penis flying through the air.  So I think it's more subliminal.  I never thought that.  You know the widgets that are in the bottles these days?  The commercial for Guinness, they show a giant spaceship.  You look like a penis.  She's right, though.  And you know what?  It's subliminal, and now I feel better,  because I've always been grabbing Guinness and just rubbing it on my face and backside.  I was wondering why I was doing that.  Awful, man. 
[01:42:00]  You're supposed to drink it, not dump it on your back, Jim.  Oh, man.  Dump it on your back.  I finally figured it out.  You're bisexual.  No, let's just go for the joke.  Oh, yeah.  Annie, thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  The problem, everyone, it's seven.  Seven's been the problem.  Seven.  Seven's the problem?  Seven's the problem.  All right.  Everyone knows that now, I guess.  For what do we learn?  Because I'll show you now.  All right.  Watch this. 
[01:42:30]  Show us.  Hello?  It doesn't work unless there's another caller down.  But seven was the problem.  Seven's the problem.  All right.  We should take a break.  You've got some funky-tasting spunk.  Where did that come from?  Oh, I don't know.  That wasn't even planned, but it worked.  All right.  Gary Hoey in the studio.  Why doesn't he play us the break so we can regroup here?  All right.  Here we go.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. 
[01:43:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Playing live in the studio today, Anthony.  Gary Hoey.  Yeah.  Ho, ho, ho.  Hoey.  Picking ass with the Christmas songs, man.  He's got a best-of CD out right now.  Right, Gary?  Hold on.  Hold on.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  The best-of is in all the stores now, and they can also go to GaryHoey.com, and if they  want to know how to spell Hoey, it's just like Joey, with an H. H-O-E-Y. 
[01:43:30]  You can play and talk at the same time.  He's going to play Hocus Pocus for us to end the show later on, so stick around for that.  You're going to love it.  You know what?  It's Christmas time and stuff, and I'd pop this in around the house. 
[01:44:00]  It beats the hell out of...  And then there's the new one.  And then there's the new one.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. 
[01:44:30]  Have you heard of the sheep one?  The sheep one's coming off the ship.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big boots not included.  I have to tell you, too, man, I normally detest Christmas songs when played with guitar.  You are really good, man.  I really am enjoying it.  Thank you so much, bro.  That's because, you know, he tried out for Ozzy.  No, no, no, dude, I would tell you at least on the side.  I'm really enjoying it.  Very good, man.  Thanks, bro.  I'll give you a copy.  Like I was saying earlier, it's a testament to how good you are, is the fact that when 
[01:45:00]  we were first approached to have you on the show, the guy that pitched it was such a jerk  off that we were like, oh, my God, this is going to suck.  This guy comes up with nothing good.  Remember, we were going to have Gary in here for maybe two minutes?  Yeah, it was like, all right, he came from L.A. or wherever he came.  All right, have him come in and play his stupid Christmas song and get him out of here.  Four hours later, he's still jamming with us.  I told you guys.  Did you guys think I was going to do something like this? 
[01:45:30]  You thought I was going to come in and go.  Yeah.  Did you think there was going to be something like that?  Jack Frost, nothing good at your nose.  That's pretty much it.  He thought it was going to be that.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Do you know Little Drummer Boy?  That's my favorite Christmas song.  It really is.  I love the pa-rum-pa-pum-pum part.  You're not. 
[01:46:00]  You know, buddy.  I don't think you're not.  Oh.  Kenny, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, Kenny.  Gary Hoey does what Rich Boss can't, and that's make material from 20 years ago sound good.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, bro.  No problem.  He's not even here to defend himself.  That's poor Boss.  He's always getting the views.  Poor Boss.  He's a creep.  Hey, Sean, what's going on?  Sean.  Hello.  Sean-y.  Hello.  Sean-y. 
[01:46:30]  Hello.  Sean-y.  He's not there.  Hello?  Sean.  Sam.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Sam?  Hey, Sam.  Long-time listener from Boston, way back when.  All right on, man.  Hey, first off, Patty thing.  Oh, my God.  I laughed so hard, I nearly crapped myself.  You guys are freaking hilarious, as always.  I'm sure you enjoyed it, because not many people enjoyed that little segment today.  No, they're yelling at home.  Among other things, anyway. 
[01:47:00]  Gary Hoey, he cranks, too.  You guys rock.  Thanks, buddy.  Happy holiday.  Hey, Hopi.  Yeah.  I'm going to try to scare you for a second.  This might, I don't know, you might remember this or not, but remember Kippy Love?  Kippy Love, yeah.  Kippy Love was a cranny.  Yeah, I remember this chick, even with a kickstand.  Yeah, she was a chick with a you-know-what, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got to get her on the show again.  Oh, my God.  What's this her stuff?  Those things you guys used to do with her or him, whatever.  Yeah, we'll get her back on.  Hilarious.  We'll get her back on.  She was good.  Hilarious. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, you guys rock.  A hairdresser from P-Town.  Glad to have you guys back in Boston.  Thank you, Sam.  A hairdresser from Provincetown.  Yeah, looked like Herman Munster with a wig.  A chick with a...  Chicks with, yeah, those.  Okay.  What?  Relax, Lord.  Jay, what's up?  Big, fat, delicious ones.  One that'll really teach you a lesson and straighten you right out.  Big fat back problem.  Come on, lady, quit holding me down.  You can run your hand down her big back like you did with that hooker. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  I just had sex with a girl.  Really?  Why are there chin prints in your back, fella?  Hey, Jay, what's up?  Jay.  Hello.  Yeah, what's going on?  My name's Chad.  Someone is deaf outside today.  Yeah, that's right.  They're getting all the names wrong.  What's up, Chad?  Okay.  I was talking to this girl, and she was telling me that her dad hits her.  I'm like, oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Well, I talked to her on the phone, and, you know, we started messing around a little bit.  And she goes, so what do you like?  And I'm like, oh, I like to get a little kinky. 
[01:48:30]  I like to get bitten, you know, whatever.  And she goes, oh.  I go, what do you like?  She goes, oh, I like to get hit.  I was like, okay, that's cool.  Yes.  I think he's always in.  And she goes, no, I want you to, like, hold me down and hit me across the face.  Oh, my God.  So my question is, you know, she says she wants me to do it, so is that cool?  What?  Because it's obviously an Oedipus complex here.  Should I?  Can I hang out with her?  I love that.  What is that?  You know, that could get you in trouble.  Do you do this in the secret room? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, there you go.  I've been a little frightened, actually, so.  You know, that's always a little weird, because you're not sure if she's going to run to the  cops or not.  Yeah, could be setting you up.  Is she hot, dude?  Yeah, she's real hot.  And she's probably really bright, too, right?  No, not really.  No, really?  She doesn't sound bright.  Normally, no, no, no.  Normally, chicks that want to be slapped and stuff are really hot.  How do you know so much about these women?  Dude, I attract complete maniacs.  Have you had a girl, Jim, that liked that?  Yes.  And what did you do?  Obliged.  You smacked her. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Norton did it to a girl in the studio once.  Yeah.  On the ass, though, right?  No, right in the face.  Oh, that's right.  She wanted to be slapped in the face.  If they wanted.  We have a friend on the left coast, Chuck.  Chuck Farnham.  Yeah, this guy attracted some weird women.  I love it.  This guy was seeing, I guess you'd call it seeing, seeing a girl that liked her boobs  punched really hard.  Not like smack or anything.  Not a smack.  Close hand fist.  She liked it when he punched her so hard that the next day she would go in front of the 
[01:50:00]  mirror and check out the bruises.  That's why she did it.  She would totally get excited.  And then she would, yeah, get off, get off doing that, looking at the bruises the next  day in front of a full length mirror and touching the bruised areas.  That I couldn't do.  Punching.  Punching that.  So he would oblige and start like kind of jabbing softly.  And she goes, no, harder, harder, harder, harder.  And he would just whack her.  And he just like full punch to her right one. 
[01:50:30]  See, punching is too like violent.  Smack, spanking is.  It's different.  It's like, I saw a girl, I used to see this woman years ago who liked to be spanked.  And I mean really hard.  So she'd be black and blue in the morning on her ass.  But just from being spanked, I wouldn't, you know, punch.  You raise those blood vessels up there.  Yeah.  Break them.  Oh, was that nice.  A little paddling on that backside.  Red and warm.  Sit down, sweetheart.  Nice.  All right, Chet.  I don't know what to tell you, I guess.  Smack her, dude.  I'm telling you.  Smack her.  Hold her hair and smack her.  She'll love you. 
[01:51:00]  She like the hair pull and everything?  Of course she does.  Uh, yeah, she said she liked the hair pull.  Of course, she also mentioned that she liked golden showers, too.  So I was like, uh, I don't think so.  Really?  Dude, what town does she live in?  Yeah, Norton's in love.  Yeah, what are you doing getting between me and my soulmate?  Hey, it's one thing to give them, it's quite another thing to get them.  Oh, please, give and receive.  It's the holidays, pal.  Yeah, Prodigy has a song called Smack My Bitch Up.  You can play that while you're there.  Yeah, and then just smack the crap out of her.  Yeah, I think I want to play something like Lens, Steal My Sunshine. 
[01:51:30]  You know, something light.  All right, Chet.  Nah, come on.  I'll get it later.  Thank you.  A little salty Christmas love.  Hey, John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  John.  What's going on with that?  Hello.  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Yeah, you.  What's your name?  Me?  Yeah.  John.  So why aren't you answering?  No, I thought, I don't know.  I didn't think I'd give the guy my name.  Well, you said your name.  I know, I forgot.  I forgot.  Wow, you are effed up.  You're baked, right?  Huh?  You're baked.  Oh, no, I can't anymore. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, hey, with that language.  Whoa, whoa.  Still at home.  Hey, hey.  Potty mouth.  You're effing mom.  Language.  What did she do to you?  She called me?  Yeah.  She said, leave the house and go find a job?  What?  No, no.  I was kind of talking to my friend.  How old are you?  About it.  17.  Oh, so you still live at home, and you were talking to your friend about the weed?  Yeah.  And what happened?  God, I don't know.  That's a sock.  Yeah, and he was kind of on the other line.  So, yeah.  My brother got in such big trouble out in California. 
[01:52:30]  My mom sent him out to California to live with my dad.  And I was out there at the time.  And my brother, just the biggest pothead ever.  And he had a little baggie of pot.  You know the end result?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where you get it in the corner of the bag, and you twist it, and pull the rest of the bag off,  and you got the little corner.  And he put that in his sock.  And he's hanging out.  My father's there, and he puts his foot up on the table for some dopey reason.  And my father goes, what's that in your sock? 
[01:53:00]  It's like, oh, Jesus Christ.  So, my brother goes, nothing.  Let me see.  Pulls out the bag of weed, and it was just like, smacks him upside the head.  Dad got pissed at something?  Yeah.  Which is hysterically funny, because it's like, yeah, okay, Dad.  How about you smoke some of it and put down the bottle of Jack?  I was going to say, with all the stories you have told, I'm assuming that you guys all got to hide together.  No, no.  He was so against the pot for some reason.  And then after a while, it was just, it didn't matter.  Joe's smoking in front of him. 
[01:53:30]  After your dad slapped him, did Joe ask him to punch him in his chest?  Yes.  Yes.  So, John, what can we do for you today?  No, I was just wondering about Norton.  Like, what specifically does he do?  What do you mean, bro?  Like, on the show, like, what's his specialty, though?  He just hangs out.  Like, I've been listening to you guys for, like, the past month.  So, are you calling just to, like, trash one of us?  No, no.  What do you mean, what?  No, no, I mean, like, is he just, like, one of the guys?  Or have, like, one dude, he does, like, all the sound bites and everything.  Right.  We call him the exclamation point. 
[01:54:00]  He just hangs out here.  It's like a...  He's funny as hell, though.  That's why I'm...  Oh, thank you, sir.  No, I don't really have a...  It's not, like, a certain thing.  It's just...  There's no title.  John, it says on the phone line that you wanted to have a guitar off with Hoey.  Yeah, that was just to get in the show.  Yeah, we hate when you guys do that.  Because you sucked.  You completely sucked.  So, you effed up the show.  Sorry.  I hate when you guys do that.  Hang up on them. 
[01:54:30]  There's a reason we have phone screeners.  Perfect example right there.  Ugh.  I had to get through the phone screening.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  All right.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  This is Rob from Boston.  Hey, Rob.  How's it going?  Long-time listener.  I've got to tell you, there's this chick that I used to work with.  Yes.  I was listening to the whole bit on girls that like getting smacked in the face and such.  And there's this chick I used to work with that used to get off on giving a guy oral pleasure. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  And while she was doing it, he punched her in the ribs.  Let me get this straight.  You would punch her in the ribs?  I wouldn't.  Oh.  But she told me that she really enjoyed that.  That was her thing.  That is so weird.  And it just totally freaked me out.  Let me get the whole thing there.  You're getting some there.  Okay.  And then you reach over and like, wham!  Yep.  Right.  Well, that's kind of weird.  No, it's not.  Totally lay into her.  She really got off on it.  She told me one time she cracked her rib doing it.  Oof.  But wouldn't that affect, like, biting?  What does that come from? 
[01:55:30]  No, no.  You pull the hair back.  Pull off for a second.  It'll suck to the rib.  Oh, it's really sick.  She used to give me the willies.  Hey, Rob.  How you doing?  I haven't talked to you in a long time.  Last time was when I told you the story about how I would get women and punch them.  Then I get accused of rape and all kinds of things in my hotel rooms.  Rob, you weren't supposed to let that story out.  Yeah, I like when girls give me oral pleasure and I pop them in the ribs until they crack. 
[01:56:00]  That's a beautiful thing.  I got to share it with ONA, man.  And I say, if you bite me, I'm going to punch you right in your face.  And then even if they don't, I do anyway, allegedly.  You assaulted someone the other day, Mike.  I was in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  For some reason.  And I'm hanging out at a disco there.  And somebody gave me lip.  They said, hi, Mike.  I like you.  So I had to punch him in the face real hard. 
[01:56:30]  I misunderstood what he said.  I thought he called me the N-word.  But he just said, hi, how you doing?  And I punched him in the head.  Because it's what I do.  You can't walk up to a tiger and say, hi, tiger, how you doing?  And not expect him to claw you and bite you.  I am just me.  You know, I have a tiger at home.  And sometimes I put peanut butter on my yam bag.  Boop now, it's mine. 
[01:57:00]  And there's rape allegations, too.  There's always rape allegations with you.  I don't know why that is.  What is it about taking a girl against her will, punching her, and having sex with her that gets all these rape allegations?  Spell allegations, please.  Allegations.  Yeah.  Q-L-V, the number two, and the sign for pi.  It starts with A.  A-L-L-I-G-A-T-O-R-S. 
[01:57:30]  Alligators.  It's not alligators.  Okay.  V, Y, and hieroglyphic.  I don't know what it is.  Mike has a hard time getting dates.  That's why I was in Bed-Stuy.  I was hoping to pick up a crack whore.  I saw Tom Brokaw there drinking until about 9 or 9.15.  9.15.  And he picked up the crack whore I was going to go home with. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  With.  With.  W-I-F.  With.  I can spell that.  No, that's not how you spell with.  Two fishes.  T-I-F-2.  The number two, fishes.  You see my sister in the paper?  If you're looking.  Well, there's a picture of you and your sister, yeah, in the Daily News today.  Yeah, she's wearing a big fur coat.  Oh, that ain't a coat.  It looks like you with a wig on.  Oh, my God.  That dude looks like me with a wig.  Look at my sister. 
[01:58:30]  She got plenty of bling bling.  I thought she was wearing a fur coat, but that's the same thing she was wearing in that  Samsonite commercial.  Oh, my God.  Mike.  I remember this day, me and my sister went out, and I found this white girl I like, so  I grabbed her and climbed up the Empire State Building and swatted at biplanes.  What?  And they called that rape because I, hold on, because I put my in her against her will, and 
[01:59:00]  they called that rape.  This was great.  This was right after, this picture was taken right after we had lunch.  I threw her a rib roast.  Right down to the bone, like them old Piranha movies.  All of a sudden, I just saw a bunch of smoke, and it was gone, and there was nothing but  a bone left. 
[01:59:30]  Bone.  L-Q-V-S.  Bone.  You're going to argue with me?  No, no, no, no.  I'll rape you.  Allegedly.  Just don't pinch my ass like Steve.  That's a beautiful sister I have.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  That's right.  This was great, and I held a cab, and my sister went off with Jane Goodall. 
[02:00:00]  Man, it's unbelievable how well Anthony does the Mike Tyson impression, huh?  What's the problem?  Shut up.  Oh, no, that wasn't this day.  Oh, this day was tragic when I went out with my sister.  Oh, yeah?  I remember this.  Yeah.  Right when I got in the cab, I looked back, and someone had shot her with a dart and put  a tag in her ear.  Oh, my God.  But she's a beautiful sister, isn't she? 
[02:00:30]  Yes, she is.  Spell sister.  Sister, P-V-M.  Don't tell me.  I got it.  I know it.  P-V-M.  Tool and a tire.  No?  No, that's not.  I can spell.  Spell.  It was close.  L-T-5.  All right.  What is the story with Tyson, anyway? 
[02:01:00]  He really punched someone for saying hi?  Yeah.  No, something.  There was something that happened in Brooklyn.  Let's see.  Tyson, look at Tyson.  Jesus, this guy likes to talk to chicken heads.  That's what somebody said.  Chicken heads.  Yeah, that's a term for women.  An unflattering term for women.  He heard that, and it infuriated him.  He came charging at me and grabbed me by the neck, said Rose, who had a Tyson ripped his $5,000 mink coat and injured his neck. 
[02:01:30]  What the hell?  Is Huggy Bear out?  What the hell are they doing?  Everyone's got the fur coat.  I was way ahead of my time back in fifth grade.  My mother got me that goddamn fur coat that I had to get beat up for in school.  Thanks, Mom.  Hmm.  Yeah, this could be a little violation of his parole.  Yeah, right.  Parole. 
[02:02:00]  P-A-R-O-L-E.  Parole.  Right.  I don't know.  All right, let's take a break.  All righty.  We got a holiday message from our super GM, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  And then Gary Hoey, who's playing live in the studio, will play us the break.  How's that sound, Ann?  Cool.  All right.  And now, a holiday message from Oakley and Anthony Joe General Manager, Ken Stevens.  I don't care no more. 
[02:02:30]  Okay, my life is over.  I will kill everybody.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head and shoot all these motherfuckers.  And I'll shoot myself.  I guess I'll get up for you.  I'm trying to take a nap.  Let me get off the f***.  Happy holidays from all of us at the Opiate Anthony Joe.  Come on.  Come on. 
[02:03:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Thank you. 
[02:03:30]  Thank you. 
[02:04:00]  Thank you.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Opie.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:04:30]  Gary Hoey playing live for us in the studio today.  Pumping us up right in.  Oh, yeah.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Let's go to John real fast.  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Real good, man.  Hey, I don't know if anybody picked up on Opie in the last segment when Anthony was doing  Iron Mike.  Opie kind of snuck in.  Hey, doesn't Anthony do a great Mike Tyson?  I'm not stupid, John. 
[02:05:00]  Just covering him.  I don't know if anybody picked up on that.  I don't want Tyson running after me, man.  I was doing a cacta.  That's all Anthony.  It was a cacta.  Hey, Gary Rult, man.  Yeah, we like him.  He's going to do Hocus Pocus for us in a few minutes here.  You know he's listening to the hip-hop station anyway.  I hope so.  Iron Mike ain't listening to this.  Guy said hi to him.  He punched him in the face.  Imagine what he would do to you if he saw you on the street.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  First time caller. 
[02:05:30]  Down from D.C.  I was a little weird for you guys when you guys came on the air,  but I love you guys.  You guys are great.  Norton, you rock.  Thank you, mister.  I'm a DJ down here, and I was at a party, an interesting party,  and there was a guy there that enjoyed a game called paddle balling.  Paddle balling?  Yes.  What happens is that the guy...  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me stop.  Is it what we're all thinking?  Well, let me explain it to you in uncertain terms.  How about that?  Okay.  Uncertain?  Uh-oh.  The guy would normally... 
[02:06:00]  He could either dress up as a girl or not,  but what he'll do is he'll turn around against the wall,  and he'll take his yam bag,  and he'll put it between his legs,  so that it's adjacent with his posterior.  Yep.  And somebody else will take a ping pong battle.  Oh!  And you get the idea.  Full baseball swing here.  Keep talking.  Oh, God.  And this is a friend of yours?  Oh, no. 
[02:06:30]  Not a friend.  I didn't know the guy.  But he told you.  I was hired to DJ the party.  So you do that thing...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because this story is getting weirder.  You were hired to DJ this party, and this is what was going on?  Yeah.  What kind of party was it?  It was a...  It was a...  Hope that people get together was a kind of a kinky party.  Like an S&M party or something?  Yeah, yeah.  And so you watched a guy do this paddle balling?  Oh, yeah.  Among other things.  Oh.  So it's like when you try to make yourself look like a girl from the front, 
[02:07:00]  and you stick everything...  Yeah, you got to put the fruit.  Right.  The basket of fruit.  Yeah.  The basket of fruit around back.  Yeah.  And the plum is sticking out nice and high.  All purple.  Purple red.  And the bananas there.  And then the guy would wail on it with a paddle?  Yeah.  And not just tap, tap, tap?  Full swing?  No, full swing.  And the guy would be doing it.  God damn, there's nothing pleasurable about that.  You know what?  We got to play it now. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, no.  We got to play the Nutcracker Suite.  We need something.  Have you ever heard this, Gary?  I haven't heard it, no.  Gary, you're a big fan of our show.  You've never heard the Nutcracker Suite?  I want to hear it.  Listen to this.  Maybe I'll do it on my next album.  Yeah, there you go.  We had...  Thank you, Paul.  Thanks.  That's a sick story.  We had, what, two or three guys come down?  Two guys, I think?  Yeah.  Maybe three.  Maybe three guys.  Whatever.  They were down here.  They were guys that enjoyed, for some reason, being kicked right in the yam bag. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  God.  Yeah.  Really hard.  Really hard by ladies.  Not like a little thing.  Like, they like the little wind-up and a kick.  So we had a dominatrix that was kicking the guy.  But then we also had a grandma that was down here.  For some reason, she wanted to do it.  The dominatrix kind of was holding back a little and didn't quite...  Well, because she knew how to do it the right way.  Yeah.  The right way.  It was painful, but not damaging.  It was enough pain to give them, because anything hurts, you flick that thing wrong, 
[02:08:30]  and, oh, here it comes.  Yeah.  Here comes the pain.  Ow!  You know.  Well, you only had a rattle smacked against it.  Oh, my God.  Isn't he disgusting?  He's a despicable man.  It's all real, too, Gary.  He's not making anything.  Oh, it's horrid.  So then the grandmother just wailed.  Wound up and just kicked really hard.  Pretty much knocked one of the guys out.  Just punched him, huh?  It was so painful, yeah.  And he went down, knocked out.  He saw just a flash of light in his eye, and he enjoyed it.  And this bit has a little Hollywood theme.  We call it the Nutcracker Suite. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  And it's off the WBCN Naked Disc, by the way.  They included it on their little CD up there in Boston.  We're quite flattered by that, and here it is.  Nutcracker Suite.  Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection.  All right.  I guess he's ready to be kicked.  He's ready to be kicked.  Oh, no.  This is just wrong, man.  Oh, how did this degenerate into this?  He is on his knees. 
[02:09:30]  He is chained to the bottom of the chair.  His stuff, as it would be, is a little too prominent in those bikini panties.  Girl panties.  He put on his sister's, his little sister's panties today.  Isn't that cute?  She's putting a thing in his mouth to bite on.  Panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, I didn't know.  Oh, those are your panties?  Spike.  Yeah.  She's got the whip, too.  She's bending his head back, straddling him, and she's whipping his body, his tummy and 
[02:10:00]  lower region.  Now, that's got to hurt.  That has got to hurt.  Oh, that got him.  Oh, that got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  Look, he almost fell down.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Spike is comforting him now, F.  Spike's comforting him.  Did you see him flinch? 
[02:10:30]  And he hasn't been kicked yet.  That was just the whip.  He's lining up.  Oh.  Oh, he just buckled over.  He just doubled over in pain.  He's breathing really heavy.  I have never seen anything like this.  She's lining up again.  Oh, he's flinching.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  All right, Paul is still on his knees, and Ellen's going to start kicking now.  She's been done wrong by a lot of guys.  Here she goes.  She's lining up.  Oh.  Paul goes, you didn't even make me.  Paul goes, you didn't even make me flinch.  And then she kicked.  And then she went for it.  He's flinching now at the drop of a hat.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that was a good one.  That, he almost fell over.  Oh.  Oh, look.  Look.  He's riding a wolf, I think. 
[02:11:30]  You all right, Paul?  Oh.  I just hope I get a seat on the subway.  Are we ready for contestant number two?  I'm a little scared.  I'm ready.  All right.  I guess we're ready for more of this.  I would miss this for the world.  I'm going to need some water, Sue.  Oh, my God. 
[02:12:00]  This is not right.  Spike knows she hits you hard.  Oh, my God.  I can't take anymore. 
[02:12:30]  That was a bad one.  I can't take this anymore.  That's a flash.  Is that me or the camera?  You see a light.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be it. 
[02:13:00]  I got a shot of that on the video.  That will make you cringe.  All right.  Let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  She just gave him three quick shots.  She gave him three quickies. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Grandma gave him three.  All right.  Hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  I'm with Grandma.  Grandma is pretty good.  You missed, Grandma.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't turn Grandma like that.  Come on.  Grandma's a good shot.  Oh, yeah.  She got the bullseye. 
[02:14:00]  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him?  Someone's got to put a stop to this.  This is just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us.  Yeah.  Ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  He's a proof of masculinity.  Oh, sure it is.  A man.  A man.  Well, then call me a pussy.  I found my limit. 
[02:14:30]  And there you have it.  Why would anybody want Fonzie's nephew to kick them in the balls?  Isn't that awful?  That's an old friend spike.  That was so hard to listen to.  I had to adjust like three times during that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to hear like the...  Yeah, we really don't play that often, Gary.  He's like going...  Like the only time you make that sound is when you're being kicked there.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey.  What's up?  Don't ever play that again.  It hurts in my pants just listening to that. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's cringe radio at its best right there.  Yeah.  I feel aching in my sack just hearing that on the radio.  Aching in your sack.  Oh, they're not meant to be kicked.  They're meant for a gal to enjoy and breathe in.  I'm like, Matt.  I was thinking of a song like, you know, chestnuts cracking on my testicles.  Oh.  Ouch.  Al the cop.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Nothing.  I just got to extend the thanks.  You don't get to hear Gary Hoey on New York FM radio.  It's definitely sweet you got him on. 
[02:15:30]  I've been a fan for a few years, and I got to say, very cool having him on.  He's a good friend of the show, man.  Thank you so much.  Absolutely.  It's a pleasure to be back.  It's become our annual with Opie and Anthony.  Thanks, bro.  Definitely cool, man.  Guys, have a good holiday.  And as far as Norton's ass fumes earlier, just remember, fart always equals funny.  I guess.  Dude, there's nothing better than discussing your friends.  See you later, guys.  All right.  What's better than just making your two friends want to vomit and belt you?  We're not friends.  We just use you for good radio. 
[02:16:00]  It was still great to watch you covering up like Lugosi.  Oh, I know.  Hey, Lauren.  Eddie.  Eddie, help me.  Norton.  F. Norton.  That sea sucker.  Hey, Lauren.  What's up?  Hey, nothing much.  I was wondering about the kid.  Let's shoot this heifer.  What?  Sorry.  I was wondering about that kitty litter thing.  What's going on with it?  It says you're 18 years old and you want to do the kitty litter thing. 
[02:16:30]  Yep.  We're trying to do teen kitty litter box.  Mm-hmm.  Does that still count?  The Motley Crue teen kitty litter box.  Yeah, Vince Neal told us about this.  Girls come in.  We have a big sandbox set up, and the girls actually go in the sandbox.  And we might make a contest out of it.  We'll use the clumping litter and whichever one weighs the most.  Oh, hell.  We just need one girl to do it.  And we're heroes.  Can we put our hands under it?  Lauren, you want to do it?  All right.  What's your face busy doing?  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Sounds like fun.  Hey.  Where are you from?  Princeton, New Jersey.  So you can make it here, huh?  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure.  I get my boyfriend to drive me up.  My boyfriend.  Who cares?  Hey, if she's going to do this.  Hey, he's into that, too.  You want to do it tomorrow, the grand finale, before we go on a little Christmas vacay?  Ooh, that sounds like a great idea.  Would you come in tomorrow?  I think I might.  I think I might.  No, we need...  Well, what time is it?  Definitely.  And if you tell me what time it is, then I'll try to be there.  We need you to do it tomorrow so Rocco doesn't steal his bit. 
[02:17:30]  If we wait until after vacation, he's going to take this as well.  Hey!  Hey!  All right, so can you come in tomorrow?  That sounds fine.  All right, hold on.  Lauren will come in tomorrow and do it, Anthony.  It doesn't sound sure.  Somebody talk her in.  What?  Well, put her back on.  She doesn't sound sure.  Lauren.  Yeah?  We have a problem with ladies and the Opie and Anthony show.  They never show up when we tell them to.  Well, you tell me what time to be there, and I'll be there.  But if you can't make it, you've got to tell us right now.  I can make it. 
[02:18:00]  You've got it on the radio, and all your friends are hearing you.  Because we're going to get a bunch of litter and stuff, the kitty litter.  God forbid we say, guys, come down and do this.  I mean, we'll have a line out the door.  Obviously, we don't want that.  But we would love to have you come down and do that tomorrow, Lauren.  All right.  What time?  Three o'clock.  Three o'clock?  I'll be there.  Three o'clock.  Let's not take any chances.  You've got to show up at three, okay?  Okay.  And bring broccoli and asparagus.  All right, hold on.  Stinky talker in. 
[02:18:30]  Now, any other ladies that wish to come down tomorrow, feel free.  It's our last day before vacation.  We want to do this teen Motley Crue kitty litter box challenge.  You just come down and do it.  It's easy.  I'm down and you're in.  Yeah.  We're just trying to show off for our pal, VCL.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  He goes, look at this.  He goes, and points.  Watch him lean back and look.  Look.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  What is wrong with you?  Norton is totally sporting just thinking about this.  You are wrong.  What the F is wrong with you?  Dude, he just, I can't even convey his face.  I look over at Norton.  He just smiles and does that quick one nod like, yeah, and points at his junk and arched  his back so his jeans like were tight in the front.  That's what you did in the seventh grade.  You say to a girl, look at my frog jump.  Yeah.  Look at your pants.  Look at this. 
[02:19:30]  Doink, doink.  You used to do the look at my frog jump gag.  Let's just put it this way.  He looked like the sticky fingers cover.  My God.  That's great.  Still fall for that.  Norton, why do you have to show us, though?  I was just, you can tell us.  He was showing how excited he is.  This is what he's having.  I want you to know that I'm behind the show and the ideas that you're doing, and that's  proof.  Proof is in the pudding, as they say.  Telling us much better than showing us.  Telling us much better than showing us.  All right.  Well, look.  I apologize for pointing at my delicious mule. 
[02:20:00]  I was always showing my Italian friend.  Man, Dice was right.  You have problems.  I have a lot of problems.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever, Dice.  Yeah, sure he does.  Is this true?  Rocco checking in from Boston.  I'm doing this in ten minutes.  Probably.  We got to have this.  So any other girls, teen girls, want to come down and do this?  We'll put the box right in the corner, and it's easy.  You just, you just.  It'll be a side thing.  Yeah, you kind of just go, go to it.  How about this?  Open door policy tomorrow. 
[02:20:30]  You come down, wish us a Merry Christmas, go to the corner, do your thing, and there'll  be prizes for you, ladies.  And you can walk away with something.  There'll be prizes.  Should we have a really good prize for the first one to do it?  Oh, yeah.  That's the incentive thing.  What do we got, Ben?  DVD player.  Okay, let's do that.  DVD player.  We will give a DVD player to the first girl that shows up here for the Motley Crue Kitty  Litter Challenge tomorrow.  And then every other girl that follows suit will get a good prize, too. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  Because if they don't do it now, they won't be able to do it until you guys are back from  New Year's break.  That's right.  Uh-oh.  What?  Here it comes.  I'm not falling for it this time.  There's a wobbly wheel on this side.  Oh, here we go.  A plug vehicle.  A wobbly wheel.  This is just...  Go ahead, Mr. Smooth.  Dude, I was just trying to say that those folks at the funhouse on New Year's Eve, the 
[02:21:30]  funhouse in Poughkeepsie, they're going to want to hear about this, and I want to have  something to tell them.  Right.  Damn it, 845-838-5331.  I want to tell these people something.  Your plug hit a pothole.  The funhouse.  It really did.  You are awful.  It hit a puppy and a six-year-old holding it.  Danielle.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Wait, this might be Daniel.  Yeah, Daniel.  Sorry.  Hey, Daniel.  Hey, I'm from Sacramento, and I just want to say what's up to Gary Hoey, man.  I saw that guy at this place called the Boardwalk. 
[02:22:00]  Hey, watch that word.  I'm sorry.  Language.  You like the Gary Hoey.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Awesome.  He did something on my head that was like, I guess I can't say that on the radio either.  What the hell did Gary Hoey do on your head?  He did it with his guitar, man.  He was standing right there.  What did I do, bro?  I can't remember.  I think it was Jingle Bells or something like that.  Oh, okay.  He painted some.  That's my favorite.  Well, can I say hey and happy holidays, man?  I love Sacramento.  It's a great town, and I love to come up there.  Definitely.  We were hoping you'd be here for New Year's. 
[02:22:30]  That's what I was being told.  Yeah, they asked me about coming up for New Year's.  Maybe I'll try to make it up there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I want to say, Norton, I love you.  Thank you, mister.  The fun house at Poughkeepsie?  Yes.  Yeah, definitely.  New Year's Eve.  There you go.  He's in Sacramento, man.  He's in Sacramento.  He's helping you plug, Norton.  He's plugging from three hours earlier.  Thank you, sir.  I know.  I got the stupid delay.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you, buddy.  By the way, thank you to Sacramento.  We're hearing nice things. 
[02:23:00]  Nice things from Sacramento.  From the ratings trend there at KXOA.  No.  You're not doing it right.  Got to do it like Mr. Amos does it.  KXOA.  Right.  Okay.  Sorry.  Never again.  Well, we got to get Mr. Hoey out of here.  The Ho-Ho Hoey CD's available in all record stores right now.  Yes.  The latest one is like the greatest hits of the last three he did.  It's the last three kind of mixed together with four new tracks, and they've all been remixed  and remastered in 17 songs. 
[02:23:30]  Look at this.  Early, what did we learn from Danny?  He goes, Hoey, spelled just like Joey, except with an H.  Oh, cool.  Look at that.  I was going to name my first son Joey, but I thought he'd come back and kill me when  he was 16.  Joey Hoey, yeah.  You know, I named him Ian instead.  By the way, your wife's a piece of A.  Thanks, bro.  Oh, wow.  She's pretty hot.  Thanks.  You could say your wife's attractive.  Well, a piece of A thing.  Why sugar coat?  Well, next year I'll bring you some special pictures of her.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know, the ones before the kids, you know. 
[02:24:00]  Special.  She still looks fantastic.  And Hoey just had a son recently, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes.  So congrats on that.  Thanks, buddy.  And it's GaryHoey.com?  Yes, GaryHoey.com.  All right.  I've been waiting for this all day long, Anthony.  He's going to play us to break with Hocus Pocus.  You got it.  Check this out.  Check this out.  Sit back and relax.  Here we go.  Wow.  Come on.  Give it up for Gary Hoey.  Thank you so much, man.  Thank you, Gary. 
[02:24:30]  Damn.  What a way to end.  Woo.  Wow.  Wow.  You like the beer drink on the bass solo?  That was hilarious.  Very nice.  Oh, thank you, man.  It's our buddy, Gary Hoey.  He'll be back.  Oh, yeah.  Great job.  The next time he comes through New York.  Absolutely.  Great to see you guys.  And I want to wish all you listeners a happy holiday and wish you guys a great vacation.  And go out and get the Ho, Ho, Hoey CDs.  I'm telling you, they're great.  All right?  God bless you.  It's Gary Hoey, everyone.  As we go to break, it's a fake commercial before the real commercial, so don't dump out yet,  guys.  It's the Jim Norton doll commercial. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  That's the Jim Norton doll.  Oh, Ben, you screwed up.  That was the bad commercial that he had from yesterday.  Ben never screws up.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  Ben never screws up, Anthony.  You pay for the whole seat, but you only need the edge.  All right.  Here's the fake commercial for the talking Jim Norton doll.  Hey, kids, just in time for Christmas, it's the Jim Norton talking doll.  Guys. 
[02:25:30]  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show, and you've probably seen him receiving yellow  discipline in cheap motels.  Shut up, stupid.  Now you can bring him home.  Just squeeze his mule and let the sparks fly.  Don't try to make a poignant statement, you ass.  Made entirely of recycled rubbers and stuffed with nails and broken glass, the talking Jim  Norton doll is fun for everyone in the family, even mom.  Just keep belating your husband until he pays the bills.  Oh, that Jim.  What will he say next?  You talk like a foghorn leghorn. 
[02:26:00]  Shut up.  It's an educational toy, too.  Who better to learn about the birds and the bees than from Uncle Jim?  It's not rape if they blink twice for yes.  Comes complete with martini glass, shaker, and vial of urine.  Some assembly required.  Shut your yaps.  New from Stinko.  It's the Jim Norton talking doll.  You stink.  Available where Megan's Law doesn't apply.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Own it, baby. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, sure.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  You can do it.  You can do it.  This mess sounded like something today.  You can do it.  Actually, who cares?  We start our fake suspension after tomorrow's show.  Hey, I have a feeling we're going to get suspended tomorrow.  Damn, Jim. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, tomorrow's the last live show of the year.  2001, Anthony.  2001.  2001.  2001.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Stop pinching your fat.  Stop it.  You're fab.  You can do it.  At least this year for New Year's Eve when they all gather in Times Square and they're wearing  their dopey 2002 glasses.  They're dopey 2002 glasses.  At least it'll be symmetrical.  Symmetrical. 
[02:27:30]  Symmetrical.  Put their eyes through the two zeros.  Yeah, it's going to look cool.  Yeah.  Hey, a couple show notes real fast.  Yeah.  We do go on a little Christmas vacation after tomorrow's show, because we will do the kitty litter box thing tomorrow.  Uh, Thursday, we're rerunning Sex for Sam 2, Anthony.  You're going to love that.  We'll show you how the bit is supposed to sound.  Yeah.  Not a cheap imitation. 
[02:28:00]  Dang.  And then Christmas Eve, a homeless shopping spree, too, will be replayed.  So tell your friends.  That was, I think, our best show of the year.  Oh, you're going to love it.  It's time to play What Do We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show today.  Very educational.  You think?  Hey, sure.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned that Norton has the muscle tone of Christopher Reeve's thighs.  Nice.  And, of course, seven was the problem.  Yeah, everybody's picking up on that.  See, it was educational.  People learned seven was the problem. 
[02:28:30]  I only said it five times, making sure people would write it down.  I think I'd do it for a while.  Todd from Philly.  I learned Norton likes getting whacked in the yam bag with rattles.  And Stalker Patty's hair growth is slightly off schedule.  I love wise asses.  Jerry from Medicine.  Today I learned the Steve Irwin interview was a croc tease.  Norton prefers his Guinness rubbed on his face and poured on his back.  And one question.  Which does Norton have more of, diseases or perversions? 
[02:29:00]  Big Al from the city.  I learned today Fat Boy Opie is a new bit.  Brother Joe's version is better.  Starker Patty is driven to make gifts.  She's a carpenter, Ann, after all.  Danny from the city.  Today I learned Norton stinks.  Literally.  Seven is the problem.  And Hoey is spelled like Joey except with an H.  Yes.  Cleveland Cop from Cleveland.  When do you guys start your Christmas suspension?  Well, we said that earlier.  After tomorrow.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned coffee cake farts.  Never funny. 
[02:29:30]  Kevin from the Bronx.  Today I learned Fat Boy Opie is in da house.  Yo.  Kevin from the Bronx.  Today I learned Norton dated a girl once.  Kevin from the Bronx again.  Norton loves guys who play guitar.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Another one from Kevin.  Kevin on a roll here.  Uh, I learned if you come within arm's reach of Ozzy, Norton will drink from your mule.  And one more from Al Mack.  Today I learned telling us is much better than showing us.  Norton.  Right.  I didn't mean to do so many gay references today. 
[02:30:00]  I apologize.  Jeez, he just nodded his head, pointed like, look, see?  Yeah.  I'm psyched.  I don't think there's anything, I didn't mean it like in a weird way.  I'm just like two buddies.  One showing the delicious appendage to the other.  I just need to know when did it, I just need to know when did it, uh, when did you turn the corner?  Yeah, when did it, uh, get to that point?  When did you feel comfortable around Ant and I that, you know, this would be a cool thing for us to check out?  Ten minutes after I met you.  All right, let's go to the phones. 
[02:30:30]  Bobby, what did you learn on the show today?  Making Sucker Patty cry, always funny.  Was she really crying?  I couldn't look.  Yeah, she got all choked up.  She couldn't talk.  I was asking her, she was like, uh, uh, uh.  And I learned one more thing, too.  Come on, man.  What are you doing?  I don't like to squeeze his boobs.  Yes, I do.  Yes, he likes squeezing his boobs.  Yes, he does.  Eric, what's going on?  Eric.  Hello.  Eric.  Hello, guys. 
[02:31:00]  What's up?  You got some phone delay there.  Listen, today I learned that on his honeymoon, Steve Irvin made his wife sit on his croc.  Yes, he did.  Yeah, sat on his croc.  The other guy kind of stole my thunder.  Yes, he did.  I want to thank the twat for cutting off our interview with the croc.  Yeah.  What was that about today?  Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I learned today that Norton's favorite Christmas song is the Little Hummer Boy.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Hey, can I do what I learned in the studio yesterday? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I learned that when Earl takes his hat off, his head looks like a giant milk gut.  Take it easy.  Have a nice vacation.  Nice suspension.  Funny.  I don't know if this one will make the air.  Let's try it.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Luna, good day.  Back to you, Rusty.  Thank you.  Back to you, Rusty.  Salty yellow flavor, he said.  That's great.  Well, whatever.  All right.  Brian from D.C., what's up? 
[02:32:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, I learned fat boy Opie is blacker than Big Chocolate.  Hell, yeah.  That's right.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye.  Very good.  Any over there, Ed?  Nah, I'm thumbing through him, but not much.  No?  I need somebody later on this evening, maybe around midnight, on the adrenal server for  EverQuest.  Adrenal server, please.  Give me a hand.  I've got to make the next level.  You saw what happened in the office.  I went line dead when your internet connection cuts out on you, right when I was going into 
[02:32:30]  battle, and it knocks a lot of points off your experience level there.  So give me a hand there.  Thank you.  People out there, help me, Opie.  All right.  It's like a little call, like I sent up the bat signal.  All right.  For that.  Well, I guess we're done for today.  Yes.  Thank you, Gary Hoey, for stopping by and helping us out today.  And can I thank, real quick, just one more time, I just want to say thank you so much  to Accurate Imaging for taking care of that website.  You did a great job.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  How about your website again, Jim?  I really appreciate it.  Eatabullet.com. 
[02:33:00]  Eatabullet.com.  All in one word.  It looks really good, and they have just begun to build your website, obviously.  There's a couple of soundbite stuff going to go on it, yeah, but those guys were  great and patient, and thank you guys.  All right.  Anthony, we're going to leave with Ding Fries Are Done, the request for this damn thing  coming in like crazy every year when we play it.  Yeah.  We get lots and lots of requests for it.  Yes, yes.  By the way, every single radio station in America plays this damn thing, so put it in  Yahoo, and look for yourself.  Ding Fries Are Done in Yahoo, and you'll see it shows up a lot. 
[02:33:30]  We're certainly not claiming this to be our own, okay?  It's a holiday favorite, and we'll leave with this, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
