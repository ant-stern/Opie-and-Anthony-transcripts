<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, characterized by rapid-fire exchanges, frequent interruptions, and copious amounts of vulgar language.  The show began with the hosts recounting their recent trip to the Borgata casino in Atlantic City. Anthony detailed his substantial gambling winnings, describing the luxurious treatment afforded to high rollers, including complimentary bottle service, lavish suites, and the possibility of a helicopter ride. He also mentioned encountering Wanda Sykes.  This segment also included discussions about family visits (Anthony's delayed visit to his nephew and Opie's Thanksgiving plans), storm damage in Long Island, a running joke about Jim Norton's supposed fondness for transgender people, the Hostess Twinkie bankruptcy and Jenny Hutt's parody song ("Snack Cake Like You"),  Opie's frustrations with his brother's insurance claim, and the Kevin Clash scandal.

The next segment began with a scathing critique of an unnamed woman's appearance and personality, followed by a discussion of a previous show appearance with Guy Fieri, which they described as a "pounding".  Despite the initial negativity, they praised Fieri’s food, a sentiment further emphasized when they received a delivery of Guy Fieri's desserts, which they excitedly (and crudely) sampled alongside staff member Sal.  This segment also touched upon Jennifer Hutt's music video, the Hostess Twinkie shutdown and Chris Christie's response (or lack thereof), their upcoming Thanksgiving special with a surprise guest host (name withheld),  collaborations with other radio personalities (including Roland and his recent guests), an inaccurate hurricane prediction by weather forecaster Ira, Anthony's office toilet paper theft,  reminiscences about U2's *Achtung Baby*, Irish folk music (the Dubliners and Flogging Molly),  E-Rock's radio show (including clips and discussion of his awkward guest introductions of Big O and Dukes, and Eastside Dave's appearance and potential drug use), and anecdotes about various radio personalities.

A "Roland's Food Court" segment featuring Roland Campos and guest Perry Rose followed.  This involved clips from Roland's show, highlighting his sometimes rambling and offensive style. Discussions included their new four-episode TV deal with Spike TV for a Davey Mac Sports Program, further ruminations on E-Rock’s show,  potential radio show ideas involving old-school personalities (possibly including Don Imus), calls from Julia (Sirius XMU) and Peter Meehan (Lucky Peach),  a technical issue with a "baby powder spray", a prank call to Dr. Steve's "Weird Medicine" show (with Opie impersonating Ronnie from Charlotte),  Jim Norton’s humorous anal hygiene advice,  listener-submitted "F.U.K.U." messages, reminiscences about MTV Unplugged, LeBron James's move to Miami, and  Anthony's upcoming high school reunion, complete with several anecdotes about his past and other attendees.  The segment concluded with the announcement of Bill Burr's imminent arrival.

A discussion about diets and eating habits ensued, including graphic descriptions of animal slaughter and consumption, followed by anecdotes about a trip to Australia. This transitioned into a segment with Bill Burr, covering his upcoming gigs, a witnessed incident involving a passed-out man, and his thoughts on Australia.  A brief promotion of *American War Stories* followed, featuring Robert Kelly discussing his experiences in Iraq.  The show continued with Opie’s positive experience at "Night of Too Many Stars",  discussions about autism and vaccinations, a humorous digression about Build-a-Bear Workshop, sports talk (New York Jets, NFL, NHL lockout), and anecdotes about Chad Knobloch.

The final segment began with a discussion with Bill Burr about the movie *Flight*,  *Guilt Trip*'s trailer,  *Wreck-It Ralph*,  and the trend of actors doing their own voice-overs in animation. This led into the "After ONA Live" segment with Sam Roberts, who discussed Anthony's high-stakes gambling, the announcement of Lyle "Chip" Chipperson hosting the Thanksgiving special, Eric the Actor's absence, and Sam Roberts' fitness routine.  The show concluded with discussions about production issues, particularly concerning Julia,  technical difficulties with on-demand segments, frustrations with Eric the Actor’s solo show, and  final promotions of upcoming shows and social media channels.

[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Danny here, the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:04:00]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:04:30]  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions.  Burn to the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking dick again?  With O.P. the destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Tie these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton.  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Hola.  Hola.  It's Monday, huh?  Monday.  Short week?  Oh, I just love doing that.  No, leave it.  I love doing that. 
[00:05:30]  I love banging on the computer.  Am I?  Yeah.  You're gonna have to deal with that, because I'll say it again.  They don't want to put a hole in the console.  Yeah.  I don't mind it.  It's only...  Ah, your microphone fell out of the stand.  All right.  Fucking Monday.  Short week.  It's one of the short weeks, because of Thanksgiving. 
[00:06:00]  So happy.  You're happy?  Yeah, I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving.  Where are you going?  Bob Kelly's.  Oh.  I invited you.  I said...  What did you invite me?  I just said, if you're not doing anything, you could, you know, come along with us.  Where are you going?  I'm just out to Long Island, to my brother's joint.  Oh, yeah.  You still want to go?  You're more than welcome.  I told Bobby I would go to his house.  I haven't seen Bobby in a month.  Really?  Plus, yeah, I try not to drive.  But if I drove anywhere, and I didn't go see my family, I would feel really terrible.  Because I haven't seen him.  I have a nephew I haven't seen.  You still haven't seen your nephew?  I haven't seen my nephew.  My sister's baby. 
[00:06:30]  He's two months old?  I think he's just ahead of my kid.  I know.  I want to see him, too.  He's fucking adorable.  You haven't seen him?  You've got to do that.  No, I know.  I've got to go down.  Not that you want to hear it from me, but you've got to do that.  I'm a terrible family member.  Will you see him for Christmas?  Yeah, I've got to see him for Christmas.  All right.  Or is mommy going to bring Christmas presents to one of your gigs again and make everyone feel really awkward?  It's just awful.  You open up present after present after present.  Mom, I'm 44.  And Hughes insurance.  It's nothing better than, can you walk me to my car? 
[00:07:00]  I got you a few things.  And then Jimmy has to leave and go to the car, which is in the really cheap parking, so it's really far away.  And then they come marching back with a huge pile of presents.  All I want is a card.  And then there's ladies around that Jimmy's trying to make time with.  Oh, right.  But he has to open up every gift first.  Oh, it's the best.  It's one of my favorite moments ever.  It's torture.  And I've seen it a couple times, more than once. 
[00:07:30]  They doing all right?  Yeah.  They got their power back and all that crap?  Oh, yeah, they were unaffected.  And they lived down, not there, but a half hour from AC.  And my parents did not have any problems.  Really?  Yeah, I think I'm very lucky.  My sister, too.  They're not close to the water, then?  No, I think they are.  Oh, no, no, no, they're not right on the water.  My sister lost power, but she's fine.  I told Ann right before the show, I finally made it out to Long Island to see family and stuff.  And, man, I mean, you hear the stories.  Ann tells me the stories.  I've seen the news.  Wow.  Did Long Island lose a lot of trees? 
[00:08:00]  A lot of trees came down.  Everyone has a tree story on Long Island.  Yeah.  Wow.  And giant trees.  Giant trees.  They're everywhere.  Yep.  And half of them are going to fall because they haven't even gotten to the ones that need to come down.  No, the ones that are half falling down.  Yeah, half falling down, waiting to split down the middle and take out houses and stuff.  I know, right?  There's trees over wires still.  It's amazing.  And I saw just in the little area I was, you know, the Greenlawn slash Huntington area. 
[00:08:30]  Yep.  I saw a shitload of work trucks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just in that little area.  But you can tell it's...  I'm amazed that so many people do have power.  I know, right?  I'm changing my tune.  I'm pretty amazed how many people have power when you start seeing the amount of trees that are still just dangling over wires and...  Wow.  Well, I've had 90% outage.  90%?  90% of their customers were out.  Wow.  And it was bad out.  It wasn't just like, oh, let's, you know, let's patch this wire together. 
[00:09:00]  It was down poles and transformers and trees.  It's been, what, two to three weeks now?  Almost three weeks?  Yeah.  And one road, my car barely fit over, like, dangling power lines.  Crazy, right?  Still.  But they decide, you know what, that's good enough for now because we got other problems.  Yep.  Unbelievable, man.  You have to see it for yourself.  Yeah.  So, how was the Bregada?  My God.  Oh, boy.  A bunch of us were following you on Twitter going, damn. 
[00:09:30]  It was crazy.  Yeah?  It was just, it ended up like work.  It was like a job.  What do you mean?  I wanted to leave.  I just wanted to leave yesterday.  And I wound up leaving, like, very late last night.  But why can't you leave?  Just because you know you're feeling it?  It was, it was just, I couldn't lose.  Oh, you were having a good run.  You didn't want to leave.  Couldn't lose.  Wow.  I finally just picked up the, I'm going to call them casino money tokens, and left. 
[00:10:00]  What's that?  He's on to you.  Yeah, and I had to just get the hell out of there.  I had work.  I had to go to work.  How'd you do that, by the way?  Or do you want to say, know that?  What?  That's you?  A little iPhone.  I just picked it up and clicked.  Clicked while she was looking down.  Don't they front on that?  They don't like pictures at the table, I'm sure.  But technically, no one was really going to give me a problem. 
[00:10:30]  Really?  You could see, you could see at one point, those two pictures that you just had up.  Where's that other one?  There, there's, you could see where the, that's the beginning of the purple stack.  And then, uh, you could see where the, the purple stack was high, and the orange stack  is low.  Yeah.  And then at one point, they passed each other.  But I don't understand purple and orange.  Oh, the purple is 500.  The oranges are a thousand. 
[00:11:00]  Those are thousand dollar chips?  Those are thousands?  Yeah.  Those are thousands.  Sam, that's ten years of work for you.  That's ten years of work.  The purples are ten years of work for Sam.  And there's only eight of them.  I'm going to laugh extra hard, so it hurts even more.  It does hurt.  It's not even relatable money.  Like, Ant also Twittered a picture of just cash in his room.  That's crazy.  Did I see that?  I didn't see that.  I'm looking for it now.  But I was looking, and they were like, what were those?  Friday. 
[00:11:30]  $5,000.  He doesn't talk actual money, Sam.  But it set it on, it set it on there.  Ant is a fucking rap video.  Sorry, Sam.  Ant's life is a rap video.  That's really all it is.  It's fucking guns and fucking poker and cash.  That's why you really need to embrace the black man.  Dude, he takes pictures.  No white people take pictures of themselves with money splayed out.  Yeah, of course.  Except Anthony.  Of course.  Wow, that's a lot of cash right there.  Yeah.  So what happened?  You left Friday after the show, and then what happened? 
[00:12:00]  Left Friday after the show, I had my cousin RJ.  Sure.  And five of his friends, all in their mid-20s.  Oh, good God.  So they were just like, tearing it up.  Oh, God.  Having the time of their fucking life.  Why do they go down there?  Actually, that's...  Just to hang, or was there a special thing going on?  No, just to hang.  They wanted to do it.  So like, a month ago, he asked me if I could hook him up down there.  And I was like, yeah.  You kind of have a hookup down there.  I hooked him up with a suite, and then I decided, you know, why the fuck don't I go? 
[00:12:30]  You know, I'm just going to sit at home this weekend.  So I went, and we hit the tables on Friday night, and right off to a great start.  I mean, fucking just pounding the table.  And they did great.  You know, they're guys, you bet a few hundred bucks, and you know, if they win $800, $1,000,  they're fucking ecstatic.  You're explaining the average guy.  Right.  Right.  That probably listens to our show. 
[00:13:00]  That's nice for anybody.  They all won like about five grand each, which to them was huge.  Wow.  And they're just laughing like, this is, they're like, this is the best fucking trip we've  ever been on.  Five grand is a lot of money to go down with no money and win $5,000.  That's nice.  That's more my level, too.  It's crazy.  If I walked away from a brigada trip with $5,000, I would be so happy.  Right?  That's my action.  I don't go much higher than that.  But anyway.  Yeah.  So, and then we went to the Homestead Steakhouse down there and had just a- 
[00:13:30]  How good is that?  Huge dinner.  It was fantastic.  We had that appetizer thing that is like three feet tall on your table.  You can't-  Different shelves of crab meat.  Seafood, yeah.  Oh, God.  The problem with that is you can't talk to the person you're having dinner with.  Sit down, Danny.  It's like one of those.  Right.  You try to-  Lamp in the way.  You try to look past the shrimp so you can make some eye contact.  Yeah, yeah.  It's either the problem or the advantage.  It depends on how you look at it.  Who you're with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, we did that and then they went to that club down there, that fucking murmur club. 
[00:14:00]  Is that the club where the girls-  That's the club with a hot fucking chair.  Barely wear anything and they're just lined up all around the casino waiting to get in.  And those tiny little black dresses and shit.  They do that on purpose to distract you at the tables.  Because you're not paying attention to your action because you're trying to see if you  can see cunt lips.  It works.  On a few of these broads.  Yeah.  So, they went in there.  Did I just say cunt lips?  They would just-  I'm a father of two.  Oh, wow.  Cunt lips is a great word.  Jesus.  You don't say it enough as far as I'm concerned. 
[00:14:30]  I was going to email you.  Say cunt lips more.  Father of two and I know my in-laws are in the kitchen right now having coffee.  Good.  God, I'm a disgrace.  Well, you're not a disgrace.  You just like to go and look at cunt lips.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm not saying that I got to like completely change my tune, but let's like soften out the  edge a little bit.  Lobster.  Anyway, go ahead.  So, murmur.  Yeah.  Yeah, so they went there and they were just signing for stuff and getting bottle service  and they- Mike, my guy down there, hooked him up unbelievably. 
[00:15:00]  Who's your guy?  Mike.  Just call him Mike.  But he's like what?  He's the, like my personal Borgata guy.  Like I call and he makes things happen.  Now, his job is to make sure- I got to say this.  Yeah.  His job is to make sure you're having such a good time that you get distracted and lose  a lot of money.  Is that true, sir?  No.  You don't think so?  No.  His job is to keep me happy so I come back there and don't go to that new place down on 
[00:15:30]  the boardwalk.  Is there a new place on the boardwalk?  Yeah.  Who's been courting me.  Really?  But fuck that.  I ain't going.  Fuck, I'll go there.  I'll go there with my $2,000.  They know.  They know if you end up there.  They do, right?  They know, man.  They know and then they get pissed off.  I'm loyal.  But if you go once, you're allowed to, you know, even though the Borgata's been very good  to you, you're allowed to look at it.  Nope.  I hear they're having- the new one's nice but they're having some issues with getting stores 
[00:16:00]  in there.  Like, the Borgata's just- is there.  I wouldn't fuck around with the Borgata either.  Oh, the Borgata and the water club is beautiful.  Yeah.  Actually, I'm not a huge gambler but I love going down once, twice a year just to do- you  know, hang out a little bit, get a couple massages, a nice dinner.  Yeah, they went to the fucking spa.  They got some massages and shit and they would just- they couldn't stop laughing because they're  just like, they're like, you wrecked us.  They go, you wrecked us.  We're never going to be able to go anywhere ever again because this was hilarious. 
[00:16:30]  No, I'm not blowing up Mike's spot.  It seems like it's an interesting job because they want you to come back but the reason  technically the casino wants you to come back is so you lose money because you're like,  you know, you got some good action for that.  Yeah, yeah.  So his job is like, but if you lose too much and have a horrible time, you know what I  mean?  It's like a balancing act it seems.  Perhaps.  I think the host wants you to win because the host has no interest in you losing.  The casino is built- eventually you're going to- no matter who you are, if you go enough 
[00:17:00]  you're going to lose.  But the host has to answer to the guy with the hairy knuckles in the back room.  Yeah, but if you're winning-  Like, what happened to Mr. Cormier?  He came away a winner.  No, I think the only reason they'd complain is if you didn't go.  Like, where has he been?  How come you didn't take- if you go there every weekend and win, the host is doing a  great job because you're there.  They just want your ass in the chair.  They just want you there, yeah.  Yeah.  They just want your ass in the chair.  Well, they want your ass in the chair because they know the odds-  Odds dictate that you're going to lose.  Well, Mikey sounds like a good guy. 
[00:17:30]  Mike is the shit.  He's like just there for you the entire time.  Entire time.  And then I just- I gave my cousin his cell number, Mike's cell number, and anything he  needed, Mike was treating him like he was just a high roller.  Wow.  So they- you know, him and his five buddies, like he was a king.  I ask you this stuff because most people don't understand- haven't had this experience.  The life of the whale.  The life of the whale.  Well, by the way, he's off until after Thanksgiving. 
[00:18:00]  Did he take a few days, Iraq?  Yes, he did.  Going to laugh extra hard and make it hurt for him as well because he'll hear this eventually.  Of course he will.  Yeah.  I heard his show was pretty good.  Actually, I listened to a little bit of it.  I shouldn't say I heard.  Iraq had a pretty good show this weekend.  He really did.  I haven't heard it.  I'm going to have to-  A very different Iraq.  Get on demand or something.  A confident Iraq.  Yeah.  A well-informed Iraq.  Oh, well.  A happy Iraq.  Good for him.  All the things he doesn't have on this show.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  But anyway, guys.  So Mikey-  Yeah, Mikey just hooked everybody up, had a great time.  Like I said, they just treated them like they were big shots.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you get two butlers that just do whatever you need as far as room service goes.  They come in right when you get there into the room and they're like, all right, what do you need?  He pulls out a pad and paper and you're just like, all right, two bottles of Kettle One, two Grey Goose, Jameson, seen some orange juice, cranberries, some mixing, some sodas. 
[00:19:00]  And they just, all right, and they bring up bottles and just stock the bar in the suite.  And for the people out there, it's for free.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just-  You just order all that.  It's the cost of doing business.  The rest of us schmucks, we go in the mini bar and we take one little tiny bottle and you'll see $25 on your bill.  But fucking Jed Clampett here.  Right.  Shut up.  That's why I like breaking this down because this is an experience most people will never have. 
[00:19:30]  That's amazing to me.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Anything you want, like I would want other shit, like good food and stuff.  Oh, anything.  Yeah.  And then the food, we're just like, I bring up a fuckload of, you know, burgers and fucking this shit and that.  And then they just wheel it in and we all like sat around eating and laughing our asses off and then hit the tables.  All came away huge Friday, Friday night.  Saturday, I guess I relaxed, you know, because it was a pretty heavy Friday night. 
[00:20:00]  And they went out, you know, to the club and fucking gambled a little more.  And then Sunday during the day, yesterday, we just hit the tables again.  And that's when I just couldn't fucking lose.  And I wanted to get out of there.  Wait, so the picture on the right that Sam put up, that's from Friday night?  That's Friday night.  Oh, my God.  And you had a better night last night?  And then that Sunday, yeah.  Oh, my God.  And that was hours, fucking hours. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I played poker on Saturday.  A little bit of poker just to break it up.  Because poker, you could just sit there for hours on end and not worry that you're going to win or lose giant amounts of money.  Now, what was your biggest hand last night?  Or your biggest bet, wherever you want to go with this.  Biggest bet, three spots, six grand each, just double down on two. 
[00:21:00]  So 18 was the initial bet.  Right.  And then another 12?  Another 12 on top.  So one hand 30 Gs?  Yeah.  Crazy.  Win or lose on that?  Big win.  Big win.  I had a couple of six grand or $12,000 losers where I'd have six on two spots.  And she turns over that fucking four and seven and ten.  And you're just sitting there like, what happened?  Wow.  I just couldn't. 
[00:21:30]  That was crazy.  I wouldn't be able to do that.  There was a fucking crowd around the table.  I'm sure.  Toward the end of the time I was there.  Just a crowd.  And they couldn't believe it.  I just kept pulling in the fucking oranges.  Just kept pulling them in.  And I wanted to leave.  I wanted to fucking leave.  All I'm thinking is like, I got to fucking go all the way back to New York.  And then, you know, I got work in the morning.  But you're just taking a day. 
[00:22:00]  Nah.  Well, come right here.  Not take, just come right here from the...  Nah.  He pretty much did.  Oh.  I left at midnight.  Okay.  So I slept on the way back to New York.  And I got to the apartment.  I stayed in the city.  So, yeah, I slept a couple hours.  But believe me, I'm...  Shot.  I'm going to, after this program, I'm going back to the apartment and crapping right out.  But...  Until tomorrow, probably.  Yeah.  I've had it.  Was it crowded down there?  Not for the casino.  Was it crowded? 
[00:22:30]  No.  No, it wasn't.  Very roomy?  I think a lot of people still are under the impression that Atlantic City is destroyed or something.  But it's fine.  Well, the locals are destroyed, but...  Yeah, yeah.  The casinos are dandy.  No one gives a fuck about the locals down there, obviously.  All I have to do is drive off the strip to realize that no one gives a fuck about that.  I mean, I've been there when that place is fucking mobbed.  Sure.  And it wasn't.  I guess Wanda was down there.  Wanda Sykes was playing.  Is she doing the...  Okay, she's doing a gig?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was playing down there.  She was at one of the tables next to us. 
[00:23:00]  Say hi?  Friday night.  No.  We know the same people.  I was fucking tunnel vision, dude.  Right.  I fucking saw the dealer and my stack, and that's it.  And we were...  That's why I can't talk.  You know how many times...  Blackjack!  We were screaming the whole table so fucking loud.  Couldn't even...  Yesterday, I really couldn't talk.  I was like this.  Like, seven, please.  Are you going to pull a Mike Francesa today and fall asleep on the air? 
[00:23:30]  I'll give it a shot.  Did he do that again?  Supposedly.  Really?  I'm hearing that.  Somebody said that he did it again.  Supposedly.  I heard...  I don't know.  Is that people just trying to start shit or...  You never know.  I have no idea.  It's like if I went on the air and bitched it, how come the mic won't stay up high so  I can actually talk into it?  Oh, boy.  I just want it to stay up high and it won't.  Oh, boy.  It won't?  No, it won't stay up high.  Oh, no.  Is it warped already?  You need to adjust a little.  But no, I don't know how to do that. 
[00:24:00]  You just...  You do that.  I try to.  It won't.  You have to unloosen it first and then pop it up and then tighten it again.  Even I know that.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Up.  Where do you want it?  Up a lot more.  And then...  Because it's going to drop on you a little bit.  There you go.  Now try that, Jimmy.  There it is.  And then you should be able to move it down on your own slightly to...  Oh.  You know what?  You're right.  That's better.  There it is.  Yeah, but that's...  That's actually what I want.  It worked out, but that's not how that's supposed to work.  I know.  Thank you.  It's just so...  Everything's so loosey-goosey. 
[00:24:30]  I hate loosey-goosey.  Loosey-goosey.  If I was a whale down there, I would want my feet just rubbed all day long.  Instead of getting all those bottles, I would just want massages.  I would go for one of those ridiculous four-hour, I'm-going-to-nap-half-the-time massages.  They could have.  You could have.  Literally, you could have.  You could have a masseuse.  Because there's a massage table in the suite.  Jesus.  So they come up and they'll fucking... 
[00:25:00]  How nice is the suite?  It's fucking...  They always give us great rooms down there.  I've never had a suite, though.  It's a giant suite, and then on each side of the suite is a bedroom.  Right.  With full bath and fucking giant...  One is a king bed, and the other is double beds.  And then we had another room downstairs.  You guys all in the same suite, or did you?  I had another room downstairs, too, for them to...  A couple of them to crash out and stuff.  But yeah, we just kind of crashed out.  Wow.  I've gotten massages.  When I've done the gigs down there, if I do the bigger gigs, I get a suite.  It's just part of the contract. 
[00:25:30]  And I've gotten massages in those rooms.  And you just feel like a fucking...  You feel like such a big shot.  Yeah.  You just feel like a big shot when you're getting a massage in your room at a table that's in  your room.  Yeah.  It's a real gentleman's life.  It is.  And then Sunday you leave, and you realize I'm garbage.  You get back to reality.  And you wait for your car with everybody else, and you realize, oh, yeah, okay, I'm a dick  like everybody else is.  The casinos are genius.  The casino business is genius.  To comp things like that, because... 
[00:26:00]  I learned a casino business.  Yeah.  He was banging...  He was yelling blackjack two at a time.  Players couldn't hear the right parts of the table.  But the comps are so smart, because even though they're comping stuff, you're spending so much  more than they're comping.  But it's just a smart way to make you feel good, your free meals, and your free...  We knew the high roller at one of the casinos when I was opening for Dice out there.  I think he was the high roller at the Paris at the time, and one other...  He was like a fucking... 
[00:26:30]  He was like five million up.  Wow.  And he...  They had girls for him, and whatever he wanted.  He was walking around with fucking tens.  He was banging this one chick who looked like the Jessica Rabbit girl, but she was a real  prostitute.  Oh, my God.  They didn't even charge him.  Like, they would just...  He would just give them spending money.  Like, it was that type of fucking...  Uh-huh.  I'm like, man, they didn't...  I heard he lost it all.  Oh.  I heard he gave it all back, and then they would ban him.  Oh, shit.  This is in Vegas, yeah.  Yeah, because then they're done with you.  Yeah, but I heard he was fucking...  Is it...  You probably could make them get you a helicopter at this point, right? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, there's a helipad on the roof.  So they...  So they could...  You could probably tell them, look, I want to go, but I don't want to deal with that long  ride out on the Garden State Parkway.  Yeah, they could have flown me.  Yeah, they could have flown me.  Garden State Parkway.  If you want to send a helicopter, I guess I could come down for the weekend.  They could have flown me over to the west side or something.  You should do that.  Yeah, I actually...  They send a car.  You know, they give me a limo.  So I slept all the way back to New York, so it wasn't that bad.  Did the boys stay down there with you, or...?  No, they left Sunday.  They left about when I wanted to leave, but I was at the table. 
[00:27:30]  And, yeah, when that streak happens, you just...  You gotta...  Ride it out.  You gotta ride it out.  Good for you, man.  You walked away away.  That's great, because you always give a lot...  Not you, but everybody gives a lot back first.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you might have had a few more good hands, but you might have just fucking blown 80% of it.  Well, Insight is ups and downs.  Yeah.  I know he doesn't talk numbers, but, you know...  That's how it works.  He's also come in here with the other side of this.  Yeah, going, oh, boy.  Where he had a rough one.  I've never lost...  But this weekend, he didn't have a rough one. 
[00:28:00]  In one session, I've never lost as much as I've won.  But over the course of time, like, you know, I'd drop maybe 10 grand here, there.  But I've never lost as much as I've won in one sitting.  Before this weekend, where were you overall?  Oh, fuck.  I couldn't...  I honestly couldn't tell you.  Really?  Couldn't tell you.  Don't know.  It's just been too many trips, and I don't have good recollection of how much I've won or lost.  You don't want to know.  Yeah, probably not. 
[00:28:30]  It's just fun.  You don't want to know.  But I really don't know.  Yeah.  You're not keeping records?  Not keeping records.  How much did you...  I don't know what to say, but you can write it down.  It's about...  Yeah.  I won't say the number, but I'm going to go like this.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  It was a biggie.  You should have just taken the day off.  Well, that's a short week. 
[00:29:00]  Fuck it.  It is a short week.  Yeah.  Thanksgiving is right around the corner.  I think everyone else took the whole week off.  I was very happy to hear.  Did most people take the week?  Yeah.  Because they get real vacation schedules.  Oh.  I was very happy to hear Bill Burt was coming in today because...  That'll help.  Smooth it out.  Put it on autopilot.  Bill's going to win every argument today because I'm not even going to argue with him.  Nice.  I was like, fuck it.  My throat hurts.  I'm fucking exhausted, tired.  It's terrible.  I just fucking...  This box of tissues, I just went through half of it and fucking had casino shit come out 
[00:29:30]  of my fucking nose.  It was disgusting.  What's casino shit?  Just that air, the dust and air and shit from being in a casino all weekend.  You blow your nose afterwards and it's just fucking disgusting.  I thought they blew some nice air into those places.  Nah.  At one point, pure oxygen.  At one point, I did go outside.  Just to breathe?  Just outside.  It was like, oh.  Because you're locked up in that place.  It's just fake air.  And they allow smoking, right?  Yeah.  That's another thing. 
[00:30:00]  In one section.  In one section, yeah.  And the slot machines, you've got to walk through them and they're all smoking.  This old fucking piece of shit.  That's just a dumb argument.  I mean, you're smelling the cigarette smoke.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's all there, you know.  I mean, it's in the air.  It's nothing better than just breathing crisp air as you're waiting for your car when you  can finally get some air.  Yeah.  The guy goes...  Yeah, the limo driver's just like...  He pulls up.  He goes, you want a pillow and a blanket?  I'm like, yep.  Fucking tossed it in there.  Before I even left the parking lot, I was fucking down for the count. 
[00:30:30]  And then what?  You wake up in front of your apartment?  I woke up in front of my apartment.  How the fuck do you do that?  Dude, I don't care.  He's the worst.  He's like traveling with Voss.  It's so frustrating to me.  I can't sleep like that.  Oh, I love it.  I would do so many things if I was able to do that.  Yeah.  Oh, it was great.  Just fucking great.  How the fuck do you do that?  On a flight.  You've seen him on a flight.  It's fucking awful.  I was out to...  I flew back in fourth to L.A. in two days.  I'm like, all right, I'll sleep in the plane because I had the nice sleeper seats.  I was able to get maybe an hour, hour and a half in. 
[00:31:00]  But I'm thinking, man, if I could only sleep, I could sleep the whole way home, that would  be awesome.  I'm asleep from the fucking jetway to jetway.  Especially in a car.  I mean, when I'm sleeping in a car, I'm convinced the driver fell asleep and we're just veering  off a fucking mountain somewhere.  So I'm constantly waking up and checking on that person.  Especially when it's Kenny.  Kenny's getting scarier.  Oh, is he?  Because he's a very conscientious guy, but he's zoning out a lot lately.  Oh, boy.  And I noticed the light's been green for four minutes.  He's like, oh, I was reading. 
[00:31:30]  It's a fucking...  It's a sign that says Walmart.  I'm like, well, Kenny's losing his mind.  He almost rear-ended somebody in Dallas.  We got a rental car.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It's frightening.  He hasn't done it in a while, but even the short ride he gives me every morning, like  there'll be a...  Every once in a while, we'll be at a green light and I'm like...  And I'll look over and he's just...  Oh, no, I haven't had that.  I don't do the early morning.  But in all fairness, that hasn't happened in a while.  But it has happened in the past.  How was Addison? 
[00:32:00]  It was great, man.  It was one of those things where I've had bigger crowds, but there was no radio for me to do  down there.  Usually there's a couple of shows here and there.  Just to fill in the extras, right?  Yeah, I did one in the morning.  The guys, they're actually really cool guys.  And I did a couple of small print interviews, but there was no press.  You don't want to tell us their names?  No, no, no.  I forget actually, Bowen's something.  They're actually really cool.  I can't remember.  That'd be smart not to mention their names at this point.  Yeah, I'm hoping we never trashed them, because they're really...  They're guys I actually like a lot.  They're always good for a trash.  Bowen game, yeah.  I think that's them. 
[00:32:30]  The odds are we've trashed them.  They don't look familiar.  Yeah, that's them.  They're actually really...  They're a fun show.  Right on.  What do they do?  Sports talk down there?  No, it was classic rock.  All right.  But they got to play music like everybody else does.  They play a little music.  I saw Sybil from Pugs and Kelly.  Remember Sybil?  Hot Girl from Pugs and Kelly.  She's still on that station, which is our old station in Dallas is now Sports Radio.  Right.  And Pugs and Kelly aren't a team anymore.  And I wanted to see what Pugs is doing.  I haven't seen him in a long time. 
[00:33:00]  And Sybil's still on that station.  She's doing non-sports stuff, but she survived.  Are Pugs and Kelly in the business still?  I think Kelly, they said, is married and she's got kids.  And I don't know what she's doing now.  She might be out just raising her kids and Pugs is looking for something.  Or Pugs might be doing something online.  But I miss him.  I want to see him.  He was nice to us when we were off the air.  Those guys are great.  Those guys are always great.  Kelly would fucking cook for us on Sundays before he flew out.  It was awesome.  Oh, really?  Oh, you never did one of those?  No, because I fly out first thing.  Yeah, man. 
[00:33:30]  Well, I hung around an extra day because I had nothing going on back then.  And Tyson Walter would invite me over there and we would have a huge feast on Sundays.  It was awesome.  He's a good guy.  Yeah, he came down on Saturday, late show.  I was supposed to see him Saturday, but I forgot I had an earlier show than normal.  It was a 7 p.m. show.  And I slept really late and then I worked out and tried napping again for a couple hours.  You know, you've got to hit the gym.  This body doesn't come naturally. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  You know, you've just got to go down there and it was depressing.  I worked out in a 24-hour fitness and it was really, like, you know, we get spoiled at  our gym and, oh.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was an old school.  Oh.  Fucking every guy there was, like, in, like, fucking...  Like a prison yard?  Yeah.  But they were all in really good shape, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I wear my hood when I work out.  I always wear a hoodie sweatshirt because it helps me sweat more.  Right.  I don't swim.  It's hard for me to sweat because my body is just such a fine-tuned machine. 
[00:34:30]  That just happens to have tits and side fat.  But I know people think I'm doing it probably to look cool or to be mysterious, but it really  is just so I keep my body heat in this.  Mysterious.  Yeah, like, who is that celeb?  Oh, boy.  Who could this be?  Right.  Yeah, sometimes I'll actually throw my hood off if I think people are thinking I'm like,  and then I'll be like, no, we have no idea who you are, and then I'll put it back on.  Nice.  That's embarrassing.  Good crowds.  That's good.  The crowds that showed up were fucking amazing.  Right.  Amazing.  I was happy they came.  I don't have any weekend stories.  I'm sorry.  You know, I'm just raising a couple of kids, you know. 
[00:35:00]  I actually ran into my brother, and, uh...  Well, I hope you apologized.  Ah!  He fucking...  He was telling me, uh...  And I just bring this up because I'm sure a bunch of businesses are dealing with this.  He pays his insurance for the old restaurant over there, right?  Yeah.  Because of the power outage, you know, the huge storm.  Mm.  Lost power like everyone else, so he lost all his food and what's not.  Yeah.  To the tune of, like, something like 15 to 20 Gs.  Jesus. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  You know, calls up his insurance company, and they say, uh, yeah, sorry, that's not covered  because you didn't lose power right outside your restaurant.  It happened, like, in the town itself, and when that happens, you're not covered.  What?  I fucking hate insurance companies.  They are fucking killable people.  I fucking hate insurance companies.  And the only reason I bring this up, and I might be...  Maybe I don't have all the details of the story, but that is the basics. 
[00:36:00]  I know people are dealing with that.  Jesus.  I know the insurance companies are now...  It's their job to figure out how not to pay.  How not to pay, right.  Yeah, or how to give you less, or how to figure out why.  They really are...  They're built on just fucking you, and then when you need them, finding out why they don't  have to pay.  Basically, if he lost the power right outside his restaurant, the actual wire going to his restaurant,  if a tree came down on that, he would be covered.  But because there was an outage in the town, he's not covered.  Why wouldn't he be...  Like, why wouldn't... 
[00:36:30]  And they know that you're not thinking that when you sign.  They know that when you say, like, hey, the power outage, you're assuming power outage.  Yeah.  That's a big hit for a restaurant.  That's scumbags.  A huge hit for my brother.  Huge hit.  And a huge hit for other people, because I'm sure that the same shit has happened to them.  You know?  You think they would do the...  That's stupid.  I tried to watch that thing last night.  I see you pointing at the table.  What is it?  MC Hammer and that Korean guy.  Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style guy.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Parachute pants are timeless.  Now, one of MC Hammer's biggest fans, John Berman.  That's entertaining.  Huh?  It looks like me in 1990 when I started doing stand-up with those pants.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  Good old MC Hammer.  Hammer time.  So I'm sure there's a lot of people that have stories about how the insurance companies  figure out a way not to pay out.  They're fucking awful, dude.  They're fucking...  And they have to balance between people trying to scam them.  Like, because they try to get...  Oh, they go way the other way, though.  They go way the other way.  I don't even want to bring that to the discussion. 
[00:37:30]  They always figure it out where they pay less.  Always.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You're almost better off just, like, not paying your insurance and just...  It's not even taking a chance at this point.  The money you save every month.  Yeah, yeah.  Throw that in a little account somewhere and wait for the day you actually need it.  Yeah, you actually get it.  Right?  Yeah.  Unless there's some unbelievable catastrophe that happens, you're probably better off in  most cases.  Terrible.  Just, oh, this is the money I would pay for insurance or I'm just going to push into 
[00:38:00]  this one account that I never touch, just in case.  Right?  Yeah.  At least you get something out of it.  Those motherfuckers.  How do they not pay you when you just keep paying your premium?  They're just...  They're fucking...  They're...  And if you miss a payment, if you're, like, two days late, they won't cover you.  They're just...  They're fucking terrible.  It's not a business that's built on doing the right thing.  It's built on hoping that you don't catch something in the paperwork.  It's fucking terrible.  Yeah.  Scumbags.  And fucking the Elmo story. 
[00:38:30]  Wait, there's more to it?  Oh, it's exactly what I thought.  What happened?  If this is true, it's exactly what I said, really.  What happened?  I...  You know what?  I saw that in the paper and I just went to the next page.  I thought that was just, uh, just, uh, the same shit.  According to TMZ, who's usually right, Elmo Puppeteer Accuser was paid $125,000 to recant  underage sex allegations.  And not that it's about me, but I remember I had said that Sesame Street has a lot of money  at stake and I wonder if some deal had been cut because... 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And here it says, it looks like Kevin Clash agreed to pay his then underage sex accuser  $125,000 to recant the story.  And, uh, his name is Sheldon Stevens.  He came forward and he said that he was 16.  And, uh, TMZ said that he backtracked after being paid that kind of money because they  were citing legal documents.  And the report said that Stevens agreed that immediately upon execution of the agreement,  his counsel, uh, Andrew...  Scum and bag PC, uh, shall release the following statement. 
[00:39:30]  He wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr. Clash was adult consensual relationship,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, um, you know, that's...  It makes sense.  Why wouldn't the guy just take the deal for the 125 Gs?  Well, he did.  Oh, he did.  So why is this out there?  Because apparently the TMZ went back through legal documents and found it.  That's what I'm guessing.  I don't think he's releasing that.  Gotcha.  This, like, I hear, and it may not be true, but a certain high-profile celebrity who is, 
[00:40:00]  let's just say, an actor who is being accused of sexually harassing men is going to do it  with a private judge, and he has Scientology lawyers, and they know, regardless of what  is talked about, they know how to make things that never leak.  Never.  That would never happen if he had, you know, an ironclad...  Right.  There's ways to keep that shit completely private and completely from, uh, from leaking.  Jeez.  Boy, do I sound like a not knowing what I'm talking about, idiot.  I'm really fishing here. 
[00:40:30]  But you know what I'm saying.  So he was, I mean, if you were to believe the latest, this guy was having under, you  know, sex with this underage guy.  If that's accurate, if that's accurate, and if that guy's telling the truth, um, he  banged him into 16.  But even that, it's like, I know legally that's underage.  How old was he at the time?  He's 52 now, so I don't know.  But I'm going to guess that his 40s are close to 50, but I don't even care.  Oh, no, it was only, it was eight years ago.  Okay, so he was 44.  43, 44-ish, somewhere around there.  You know what?  I know 16 is young, but that's, that to me does not make you a pedophile. 
[00:41:00]  44 to 16?  That's young, but A, did he know how old he was?  And B, that does not make you a pedophile.  Legally, yeah, maybe, whatever.  But that's, a pedophile is not a guy who wants to fuck someone who's 16.  I'm getting a bunch of positive nods in this room, believe me.  Everyone's like, I hear you.  But it's like, it's not, it's, you know, you don't look at a 16-year-old as a, I don't  look at a 16-year-old as a child.  I look at them like, ah, it's, you know, I wouldn't do it because it scares me.  It's that margin call, you know? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  You're kind of like, there are some that look and play the part and others that don't.  Right.  But a pedophile is somebody that wants someone that's childlike.  Right.  Sure.  Sure.  We've got to figure out an age, whatever age that is, and as a society, and go, okay,  that's where it's at.  I think 18's a fair age.  I think that's a fair age, 17, 18.  It's like, I'm okay with that.  I don't think it should be any younger. 
[00:42:00]  One of my pal talk room changed names.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  It says superim.me slash.  They're tracking you.  It's not even my name anymore.  It used to say, I'll be in Anthony live room.  What is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What the fuck is?  I don't know.  What is that?  I think our food has arrived.  And I have a question when we get back.  Maybe someone could find the answers.  I want to ask you about the unions and hostess. 
[00:42:30]  Because I don't want to bash the unions if they didn't do anything wrong.  This might be a case if they had to do that.  Great Twinkie scandal.  Yeah.  Hostess is what?  Going out of business?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's so weird.  I wish Florentine was here today.  Great.  A bunch of fat people.  Can't be.  You have such a logical way of fake time.  And then everyone's like trying to sell Twinkies on eBay and shit.  Oh, Christ.  1010 Wins did a story on, I don't know, someone is trying to sell Twinkies for $15 million or best offer. 
[00:43:00]  Was it John Montone?  It's like, why are you wasting your time?  Obviously, it's a goof and it's stupid.  Why would you even bring that up on your news program?  Was it John Montone?  No.  Did he do it?  I thought he would do it.  Just some broad.  I like the Twinkie very good.  That's right, Raul.  He's always.  I love that guy.  I love that guy. 
[00:43:30]  That's exactly the story, though.  Of course.  You learn nothing from them.  Nothing.  Jenny Hutt has a Twinkie parody song.  Oh, boy.  Why would she do that?  She wanted a topical YouTube video.  Good for Jenny Hutt.  Wait, she's in it?  Yeah.  Good for her.  And she's singing?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  She's one of those rich bitches that her father worked in the business and she got all sorts of shit because of that.  What was the one who came to her birthday party again was forced to because this person was on her father's label? 
[00:44:00]  I don't remember.  It was somebody.  I mean, she still lives.  We did a whole hour on it.  Who was it?  She still lives on that family compound area.  Right.  You know, she lives there.  She's a nice gal, Jenny Hutt.  I think she's terrific.  She's so needy.  Is she?  Oh, God.  Is she needy?  How's the song, Sam?  It's good.  It's a take off on Adele's Someone Like You, but she did Snack Cake Like You.  All right, let's try to have an open mind.  Okay. 
[00:44:30]  This is Jenny Hutt.  Do we have to?  Don't be judgmental.  I bet it's good.  I like Jenny.  I'm happy she's out there.  Yeah.  You're going to risk our lives for a Twinkie?  There's a box of Twinkies in that grocery store.  Not just any box of Twinkies.  She's got Woody Harrelson to be interviewed.  Yeah.  Enjoying the whole universe.  That's what's on the line.  It's a good piano. 
[00:45:00]  She's a horrible acting as she's shaking her head.  I heard that you're closing down.  I'm saying that.  She's lying.  It's cute.  I heard that all Twinkies are doomed.  Funny bones are gone. 
[00:45:30]  You bet they are.  Even Susie Q's hostess.  She's not a treadmill idiot, Twinkie.  My ass was horrible.  I'm bummed to turn up at my bodega, all excited.  But I couldn't find my ho-ho's.  Ring dates, I'm not delighted.  Twinkies, nowhere to be found. 
[00:46:00]  What can we do about it?  Oh my God!  Never mind, I'll find a snack cake like you.  Yummy cream-filled sponge cake.  Any shame will do.  Her voice isn't bad.  Little Debbie is just fine.  Yeah, her voice is not bad.  It's not terrible.  It's piercing.  No, that's just her personality. 
[00:46:30]  She's kissing it in the bed.  Crownies don't suck, they're cool.  But Twinkies were just so sublime.  How much longer?  Shelf life never fazed you.  Oh God, it's half over?  Yeah, sure.  A Paris song should be a minute.  She's wearing a twirl.  Yay!  I would have known how.  I love these commercials.  This would take.  Yeah, he's got one in each hand.  Ring things. 
[00:47:00]  The kid's eating ring things one at a time.  Let me lick the chocolate off your fingers.  Yummy cream-filled sponge cake.  Any shape will do.  This is going great.  Why don't you just shove it on her ass for the big finale?  Little Debbie is just fine.  Buy tasty cakes on the line.  Brownies don't suck their food.  I want to see Jenny Hut holding a devil dog in each hand  and just rubbing it on her face while her family weeps  looking through the window. 
[00:47:30]  Devil dog, of course.  A snack cake like you do.  Oh, we get it.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  Devil dog, of course.  There's a song.  All right.  I'm going to have a chocolate dial.  Little Debbie's just fine.  Buy tasty cakes on the line.  Twinkie-pocalypse.  Brownies don't suck, they're cool, but Twinkies were just so sublime.  Brownies don't suck, they're cool, but Twinkies were just so sublime. 
[00:48:00]  We get it.  How much longer?  1930 to 2012.  Maybe I'm getting older, but I like that more than I thought I would.  She's got an all right voice.  Yeah.  What is she doing?  Why?  She did a video.  She put some effort into it.  She did a video.  Maybe, again, I'm 44, so maybe I'm just softer in my old age.  It's all right.  It's not bad. 
[00:48:30]  It's all right.  I enjoyed that more than I thought.  She wanted to be a pop singer, right?  So she actually can sing.  Yeah.  I do wonder how much effect was on the voice.  Some of it sounded a little auto-tuning.  She has a very Broadway voice.  Yeah.  Very Broadway-ish.  It sounded good.  And she's got that long-round nasal.  Yeah, yeah.  That kind of distracting.  Sort of.  Distracting.  Yeah, a little high.  Good singing voice.  Is the original, is Adele's version popular?  Oh, my God.  Adele's ridiculous.  You don't know the song?  I think I do. 
[00:49:00]  Play the real song.  I'm almost sure I do.  I'm sure you do.  And I like it.  You'll love it if you don't.  Stupid Adele, I do like her dumb shit.  She's great.  You were the first guy I ever heard mention her.  Awkward.  You talked about her first.  You were like, this girl's good.  No, but it was good.  You picked her before she was a fucking mainstream star.  Oh, I don't know about that.  But maybe before I know.  I'm always late.  I just found Nirvana two weeks ago.  I would love to take that compliment, but I think I just heard it enough around.  Boy, we miss Eric on that fucking machine in there.  Travis is looking for Adele. 
[00:49:30]  He's spelling it OD.  I have it.  I figured Sam was going to play that.  Don't humiliate you.  Don't yell at me.  Just making a joke.  Which way are we going?  I thought you guys were going to say, oh, what does she look like?  And then Sam was just going to play the video.  I wish I didn't know what she looked like.  From Jenny Hutt to Jabba the Hutt.  I got it.  It's a good one.  Advertisement.  227 million views and I'm not one of them.  Wow.  Someone like you.  Yeah, this song.  It was like the most popular song.  I think I know it.  I'm almost like that.  Yeah.  We played it before.  She's fucking. 
[00:50:00]  It's a great song.  Yeah, it is.  She's very good.  I think Amy Winehouse dying helped her, as morbid as that sounds.  I don't think so.  No?  This broad is so talented.  Okay.  No, it's not like Amy Winehouse.  I just felt like she filled a.  Amy Winehouse is lucky.  She hasn't had an album in years.  Amy Winehouse is lucky she died is what it is because this broad would have just smoked  her.  Smoked her.  I don't know.  I kind of like Amy better.  I don't think so.  Oh, you like Amy better?  Well, I like the Stones over the Beatles, so, you know. 
[00:50:30]  See, that's.  It's a little better.  It's got a.  More body to that voice, literally, but.  Sell down.  Found a girl in your married night.  Yeah, I know this song.  I hate knowing that she's a white pudgy broad.  I know.  I swear I thought she had.  She was black with that.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That.  That nice black.  You know what I mean?  That size black.  She's very popular with black people, too.  I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Fat ass. 
[00:51:00]  Big fat white ass.  Yeah.  It's very popular.  We all know what she looks like now, but when she first hit, I'm like, wow, that black  girl could sing.  That's what I thought immediately.  But it is kind of nice to see like a chubby, non-hot chick doing so well.  I just added nothing.  Dude, how ugly is Susan Smith in person?  Oh, my God.  Susan Smith, the fucking.  Not Susan Smith.  Oh.  I wish I knew what she looked like.  I'd love to have her on the show. 
[00:51:30]  I'm having a birthday.  Boyle.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  How ugly is she in person?  She's shorter than I thought she was being.  She has a worse personality.  She's a troll.  She's a troll.  She's not a nice lady.  No, she's not.  She was a little fucking, just a little short chimp.  She is brutal in person.  Look at that.  Fuck.  Oh, God.  It gets way worse in person than what you're seeing right there.  And she wasn't even nice.  She wasn't even nice to anybody.  She was walking around here holding some guy's hand. 
[00:52:00]  I wonder if she's just got a weird personality.  But that was like her handler.  I don't even think that was her guy or anything like that.  Oh, yeah.  Rock and roll?  Rock and roll desserts have arrived.  Really?  The Guy Fieri desserts that we demanded.  The extreme.  How was Guy on the show?  I heard he came and called me.  It was fun.  It was fun, man.  It was one of the highlights of the week.  Oh, good, good.  We were just fucking pounding him.  We kind of had fun with Guy Fieri.  On his rock and roll chef attitude.  It was cool.  It was entertaining.  And he also got his point out. 
[00:52:30]  I feel bad for him because even if there's no way the restaurant's as bad as they're painting it,  I guarantee they're making it worse than it is because they're elitists.  Well, the food he brought in Friday, honestly, was amazing.  Oh, he came in?  Okay.  And I went home and I ate that mac and cheese.  I don't know.  He has some dumb rock and roll name for it.  But it was mac and cheese with chicken and just enough bacon in there.  Just some bacon-like crisps, pieces or whatever.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable how good that was.  And then the sandwich I brought home, too, was terrific. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  That was that fucking dip.  That's all I know about his place.  And the food I ate was really good.  The big dipper, dude.  Oh, look at her.  She's got moles on her lips.  What the fuck's going on?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  That's a man face with a silly wig on.  But she was just basically, she was just a fucking, what did she live alone her whole life?  Terrible.  She was like this little hermit lady.  It's an amazing story. 
[00:53:30]  Certainly.  And now all of a sudden, everybody wants to talk to her and touch her and take pictures  with her.  And she was just a fucking fat neighbor for 30 years.  Why wouldn't you accept that?  Maybe she's just, that might be her personality, though.  She might just not, it's overwhelming.  You should just accept that, knowing where you came from.  Knowing that you had this amazing voice, but no one gave a shit about you because of  what you looked like.  And then you finally get that shot.  Why wouldn't you completely embrace that and go, oh my God, touch me all you want.  She might be nuts.  I mean, I don't know, but I've heard her personality was weird.  I've heard that before.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Yeah, didn't you hear stories like she was having meltdowns and stuff? 
[00:54:00]  And I didn't know if they were true, but it was, I heard it.  Oh, before we move on from the Twinkies, the Jennifer Hutt song is good.  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's good.  It's just a little long, though.  She did a good job on it.  She did it independently, which is impressive.  No, she didn't.  Well, meaning without.  Daddy got her all the fucking people.  Without the help.  Daddy continues to get her everything she needs.  A company.  Thus then why I have a dislike for her.  Yeah.  She still has Daddy helping her whenever he can. 
[00:54:30]  Poor Jenny Hutt.  She doesn't know production people.  Daddy got that.  Daddy, I want to make a song parody.  All right, whatever you need.  Well, you got to use what you have access to.  Yeah, how about she does what we do?  Stupid, shitty fucking camcorders,  and we do the best we can.  That's true.  That was a professional video.  You and I know the struggle.  Of course.  We all know the struggle.  She's never struggled.  No, she hasn't.  Maybe with her weight, but besides that, she's never struggled. 
[00:55:00]  It's no Julia.  That's right.  That's a good tune.  It disappeared, by the way.  Can we get it?  No.  Only on, if you do a lot of Googling, you can find the song, not the video.  Yeah.  That was our mistake to not have that.  Yeah.  Before we move on from the Twinkies, they ran into Chris Christie,  you know, the fine governor of New Jersey.  Yes.  Obama's pal.  And this is what went down.  Really seriously, you're not asking me about Hostess Twinkies, are you?  What's the next question? 
[00:55:30]  David, what do you have?  I'm not answering a question about it.  You know, there's so much.  I'm on Saturday Night Live enough.  You think you're getting me?  You think you're getting behind this microphone, having me talk about it?  I know he's fat and all that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a big story because a lot of people are out of work.  Well, that's true.  He should comment on it.  Spin that question and say something meaningful.  You know, a lot of people lost their jobs over this whole Hostess thing.  Having me talk about Twinkies, this is a setup, man. 
[00:56:00]  I know it.  You people are the worst.  This is a setup.  I am not answering questions on Twinkies.  And no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's bad that I even said the word Twinkie from behind this microphone.  You're not getting me to do that.  No way.  David, don't go to Devil Dogs, David.  Don't try it.  Oh, so he was just having fun with it.  He wasn't being...  Yeah, it's not that bad.  He's a...  I like him more now.  I used to hate him, but I really...  He's kind of grown on me, and I like the fact that he just kind of is a blunt guy. 
[00:56:30]  Big, blunt, fat guy.  There's something appealing about that.  Yeah, he's a good politician.  Yeah, he's very likable right now.  He is.  Everybody digs him.  They like him because he's, like, cross party lines, and, you know, it's like...  I liked how, you know, a Republican and a Democrat actually got along for a day.  It was nice.  For one day, it was pleasant, yeah.  Wow, those are Guy Fieri's desserts, huh?  What the fuck is that?  Damn.  My mother loves his restaurant.  Sal, what kind of desserts? 
[00:57:00]  I have no idea.  They just gave them to me.  Oh, so come in and distract the show.  Looks like we got Oreo and...  I heard the desserts are so heavy, only the devil could lift them.  Yep.  That's my fucking line, you cocksucker.  That's what Guy Fieri said.  Holy fuck, do I not need to see this?  They do look really good.  Just don't eat it.  I'm not going to.  I'm going to have one bite.  Or two.  Looks like some kind of chocolate... 
[00:57:30]  Is that ice cream?  Oh, boy.  What do you think, Sal?  Is this ice cream?  Yeah.  It's like an ice cream sandwich type deal.  Sal really knows how to run a segment.  It's pretty amazing what's going on here.  I'm putting this in.  I didn't look through the stuff.  It's amazing, though.  You just took over, which we like around here.  Right.  You come in with the desserts and like, all right, guys, here we go.  We got this and we got that.  I'm going to crinkle this.  Tim, you want to try this one or that one?  It's amazing.  This is amazing.  Yeah, we just hit the 7 a.m. hour.  I'm going to crinkle a bag for a little bit.  Wow, Sal, you really know what the fuck's going on. 
[00:58:00]  I love it.  I take all that shit back I said about you.  It comes in and just fucking takes over the room for five minutes.  What flavor is this?  What is this?  It's electric in here, isn't it?  Huh?  It's electric.  Fuck.  Why'd a guy send these?  You just ruined that one.  There's a bunch of yours.  That one, it tastes like, it's like mint with like a Oreo sort of cracker.  Give me a fucking spoon.  I want to try it.  I'm sorry I'm yelling. 
[00:58:30]  Stick your fucking hands in that one now.  Don't stick your finger.  No, but I'll just take a bite of yours on the other side.  Give this to somebody else.  Give this to whoever on this show wants them, gets first crack and then go around.  This is going to melt.  So give these to people in the building.  Why am I telling you what to do with it?  You know.  What's in the other bag?  Give me a bite of that one.  That's yours.  Because you already ate it.  Who told them to come in here?  Travis told me to come in.  This looks like a piece of bruschetta with...  Bruschetta with his stupid Italian accent. 
[00:59:00]  This is definitely a dessert, but it looks like...  I don't know.  It looks like tomato sauce.  That's good, though.  He comes in with a little bit of knowledge.  This is definitely a dessert.  Thank you.  Information we did not previously.  Wow.  That's terrible.  I'm sure the desserts are great.  How do you not have good desserts?  Yeah.  That's like a...  That was chocolate mint chip ice cream.  What's that?  Surrounded by an Oreo cookie.  Holy fuck is that good.  One bite's all I'm having, Sal.  No problem.  You want to try this one?  No, I don't.  What is it?  He said one bite's all I'm having. 
[00:59:30]  It's a...  It's like strawberry with like pound cake, I think.  I probably should try it.  Yeah.  I need another fork, though.  I threw mine out.  Remember you said a mere two minutes ago you're not going to eat this?  I'm trying it.  I'm going to have to try it for the radio.  What is this?  Okay, the first thing you had looked like the triple-double pie, which is chocolate chip  mint ice cream, crushed chocolate wafer cookies, and chocolate mint candy.  Wow.  That's fucking good, too. 
[01:00:00]  God damn you.  A little banana treat or something.  Really?  What is that?  I like a little banana.  Give me that.  What are you doing?  It's, uh...  Stop trying all the...  I haven't had desserts in three months.  You just gotta try it.  Why are you trying everything?  Because I'm an addict.  That must...  No.  No.  It looks like a...  As he scoops it into his face.  He went from...  I'm not going to have any.  Is that cheesecake?  I'm trying every single one.  Yeah, that's probably the New York cheesecake.  I think that's the New York cheesecake.  Crushed graham crackers, whipped cream, and seasonal fruit. 
[01:00:30]  It's good.  Because Godfieri's gotta keep it fresh.  Yeah.  It's good, but...  I don't like it as much as the other two, but it's still good.  All right.  A good cheesecake, though, man.  Always rules.  This looks like the same thing, just a strawberry...  Yeah, it's a strawberry tart.  Strawberry, yeah.  I'm done.  Three little bites.  You sure?  There's one more you might have to try in there.  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm good.  I tried all three, and they're very, very fucking good.  One is good, two are amazing.  Salad, just an amazing five minutes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Give these out to people so that I hate wasting food. 
[01:01:00]  We will, we will.  Why am I telling you?  He knows that.  It was good.  You want to try some?  No.  You like Sal's appearance?  Yeah, it was pretty amazing.  You did.  I enjoyed it.  Make sure it makes the best of this week.  Okay.  It's terrific.  You think we should cancel our Thanksgiving specials to make sure that this...  Fuck you, you aren't canceling that.  Yeah, make sure you get this in there.  I wasn't being serious, Chip.  That's got a special guest host.  Did you hear about our Thanksgiving special?  Mm-hmm.  You don't know who the special guest host is?  Yes, and I heard he did an amazing job. 
[01:01:30]  I don't think we should tell people.  No?  Okay.  Nope.  No problem.  That should be a surprise.  The ice cream's melting, stupid.  My mother would always say, Chip, I read that as soon as it comes out of the freezer.  It's going to get all over your fingers.  What is the Thanksgiving special?  Well, I can't tell you what it's called because the name of the person hosting it...  Okay, but what kind of bits are there?  Comedy bits.  Comedians.  Comedians?  Yeah, specifically.  Focus on the comics of the O.P. and Anthony show.  And their better appearances.  I'm going to eat this, so...  Sam?  Yeah, it's like... 
[01:02:00]  And then we got someone hosting, a special guest host.  All the favorite regular O&A comedians with their best appearances ever.  And a special guest host introing everything and adding his flavor to it.  That's all right.  He, I already gave you a hint.  I heard he did a great job, too.  I haven't heard it.  Sometimes on Thanksgiving my mother will yell,  Chippa, go to the store, get extra raisins for the stuffing.  My mother likes a lot of raisins in the stuffing.  You got to get extra raisins. 
[01:02:30]  Raisins are good, but you certainly could overdo it by having too many.  Oh, please.  What's he doing with these?  Are you just leaving food here?  Oh, Sal.  Sal!  You need them out of the room, right?  No, they're going to go to waste.  Sal will eat this one.  Um, I had one bite of each of these with a separate fork.  Yeah.  I'm going to try this one.  Oh, no, no, it's fine.  They're amazing.  But who should we give them to?  I'm obsessed with giving this food away. 
[01:03:00]  Why?  Who cares?  Step on it.  Nah, I hate it.  Give the fuck.  There's something, I guess, Mike, when you're a kid, you're always raised, and people are starving.  Food being wasted drives me nuts.  I love wasting food, because I came from a household where we weren't allowed to.  Oh, okay.  So now, when I can throw something away, fuck, I enjoy it.  I try not to.  I enjoy it.  It's just sugar.  That doesn't matter.  It's still somebody will...  It's just sugar in some fucking form.  That's it.  Somebody will enjoy it as a nice little treat.  The main ingredient there is just sugar.  Sugar.  As a treat, someone will have a little treat.  We have plenty of sugar.  That's not being grown or anything. 
[01:03:30]  Don't worry about it.  Throw it away.  Fuck it.  Right?  No.  I don't know.  This is Sal's.  Travis, you going to have one?  You weigh eight pounds.  Have one.  Enjoy.  I have two on my chair.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Travis is always good for some snacks.  I like that.  I'll never turn down a snack.  How about Troy?  I think Jim's emotional, because he just saw...  Why does Jimmy care so much?  Well, he saw Jenny Hutt's Twinkie video, and he doesn't like desserts going away.  No, I just don't like when someone sends us something food-wise, unless it's terrible,  but if it's good, I feel bad that someone put effort in. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  It really does.  I feel bad that somebody made something.  It'd be like me sending a comedy CD to someone, and then just looking at the cover and throwing  it out, as opposed to listening to it first, and then throwing it out, which is what most  people do.  We've all taken our selections, and we're going to give some to our friends across the world.  What about these?  These are un-fucking-tied.  One fork bite out of each one, but it was with different forks.  And Sal, what about yours?  It's going to melt.  You're walking around unshaven like our cereal rapist.  It looks like Richard Speck with his dumb glasses.  Eat your dessert. 
[01:04:30]  Are you going to have a dessert, Sal?  I might have one, yeah.  This dessert's important.  This is important.  Sal, blow his arms off.  All right, take your dessert and get out of here.  Thank you.  Was that Sal?  I think it was, yeah.  Oh, he blew his arms off.  And give those to people, but explain to them that there was one bite taken out of each,  but with a different fork.  A different fork.  You got it.  Is Roland around?  There's a girl right outside.  Ask her if she wants a treat.  Yeah, he should be.  I got clips from Eric's show over here, too. 
[01:05:00]  Roland had his big show, too, on, what was that, Saturday?  Yeah, we got some highlights from Roland's food court, it's called.  I heard it was good.  Oh, yeah, it was.  I'd rather just, Iraq, why would we play clips from his show?  Just because it happened.  I mean.  But there were no holy shit moments, right?  No, just like a little, like, we got his intro.  How many of the vibe of the show?  Him revealing his guests for the first time.  His big guests.  East Side Dave coming in at the end and taking the whole show over, of course.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he did.  Of course he did. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, no.  Know what I did instead of coming in to do Iraq's show?  And by the way, one of the topics of the conversation was still, apparently Iraq didn't hear the  segment because he was still saying that Opie might stop by.  I was very busy.  Oh.  Know what I did instead of coming in here?  What'd you have going on?  And I wanted to do this over coming in.  I went to Target.  Target?  Yeah, I went to Target instead of coming in and helping out Iraq. 
[01:06:00]  Was there like a special sale just at that time?  No, we just went to Target.  It's open like the whole day long.  I know.  We went to Target.  You could have chosen any time.  Yep, yep.  Went to Target.  Sunday?  Went to Target.  You went to Target.  That's poor Iraq.  And I hate Target.  You didn't like it?  No, but I chose that over coming in here.  I didn't have to go to Target.  You didn't?  Did you get anything?  I decided to go to Target.  Oh.  No, I didn't get anything. 
[01:06:30]  You didn't even get anything?  My wife goes, I'll go.  You don't have to go.  I'm like, no, I'll go.  And I hate Target.  You didn't have to go.  Your wife was willing to go for you.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't one of those things where I was forced to go.  No.  I mean, I don't have one of those dumb relationships where you're forced to do shit.  But you didn't come in for airship.  But I went, you know what?  I'll go to Target.  Instead of doing sexing with the bags.  Yeah.  Sexing with the bags.  Or bageling with the sex.  Whatever the fuck it was.  Yeah.  It's not supportive. 
[01:07:00]  Target is a pretty amazing place, though.  I love Target.  They have everything.  I think we used to goof on those places.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  They roll.  I didn't buy anything, though.  She bought a lot of shit, but.  All right.  When we break, you need some breakfast.  Bill Burr's coming in.  We're going to play some clips from Roland's radio show from over the weekend.  Nice.  And Bubba the Love Sponge is a genius.  Uh-oh.  Why?  He just gets himself into every story.  I don't know how he does it.  He's tied in with the Petraeus story. 
[01:07:30]  What?  Yeah.  Indirectly.  Doesn't matter.  He's still, he's being mentioned in the Petraeus story.  Wow.  I might even be being sarcastic.  He has a knack for keeping himself in the fuck.  It's amazing.  Feeling current.  He's a wrestling fan.  He knows how to carny his way into whatever he does.  Dude, he fucking really does.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We'll explain next, I guess.  And then kiss.  Yes.  Well, that ain't coming.  How about if we kiss first, then explain, then kiss again?  We could do that.  Take us out, piggy boy.  Whoops.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. 
[01:08:00]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming up on an all new O and A behind the laughter, comedian Jim Norton opens up about  his private life.  So I'm on my stomach and I guess maybe a little goes in and it's really hurting.  I'm like, yeah, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And the work that goes into creating a great joke.  And I just have to keep stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And she's like, just relax.  You're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt. 
[01:08:30]  How does a famous comedian hone his craft?  She's getting annoyed at me.  She's like, just relax.  And I'm like, I'm trying to relax.  And then a little bit of a go in.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  I have to shit.  I have to shit.  Jim Norton opens his heart.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  And his sphincter.  And then she stopped and I ran into the bathroom because I had farts.  And we all know farts equal funny.  And I fucking push out like.  Hysterical laughter and soiled bed sheets.  I kept saying, how much is it?  And she's like, that much?  When we go behind the laughter with comedian Jim Norton. 
[01:09:00]  Welcome back, everybody, to Adventures in Docking.  Now, as we all know, docking is when two gay men have their penises erect.  And one man takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the head of the other man's penis.  So let's go to the phones.  Let's see.  We have Sam here from New York.  Let's see.  Now, Sam, when did this docking fetish begin for you?  Well, I was in college.  I was a freshman in college.  So I came home for spring break. 
[01:09:30]  And I scheduled it to do it on the first day.  Wow, the very first day, huh?  You sure are eager to try new things.  Yeah.  So, like, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  Okay, so I see what you're saying.  Basically, you figured, hey, I have this extra skin on my penis.  I might as well use it to my sexual advantage.  Yes.  Now, Sam, would you say that your penis is big enough for proper docking?  Like, I don't know, six inches?  Uh, I mean, I don't know if I'm quite there.  It's average.  It's fine.  Now, it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman, 
[01:10:00]  and it didn't quite work out.  Tell me about that.  The hole in the foreskin, it wasn't big enough to stretch over.  Well, over his giant cock head.  Gotcha.  So it wasn't getting stuck to the head.  Right.  It's not stuck to the head.  It's just the hole is too small to fit over the head.  That is so embarrassing.  What did you do about it?  Going forward, I don't want to have to have an explanation.  And so we went to the urologist to get, you know, a word on it.  Right.  So you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you could dock with bigger men. 
[01:10:30]  Urologist said, you know, it happens.  It's not typical if you want to change it for aesthetics or for whatever reason.  It's a simple procedure, and you come in, and you do it, and you're out.  Well, that's great.  Now you can dock with anybody.  Yeah, that's correct.  Well, Sam, thanks for the call.  This is all the time we have for Adventures in Docking this week.  Join us next week where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party.  See you then.

Visit Chip ChippersonCyberSexChatAndStuff.com.  Yeah, I'm good.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, our video came out all right. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, that was funny, man.  Friday after the show, we ran into Ira.  Ira.  Who works for Jay Thomas.  I guess Ira's becoming his own man because he's been running away from my camera for a while now.  Oh, yeah.  In the last couple of weeks, he stops and allows some filming to go on. 
[01:13:00]  He's a big YouTube star.  I ran into him in the lobby of this building.  He gave his forecast for the big...  For the big...  Oh, the hurricane, yeah.  ...superstorm.  Yeah.  And he was completely wrong.  Yes, he was.  And on Friday, me and I were walking out together, and we ran into Ira, and we asked him...  It'd be an orthodontist.  We asked him about his prediction for the big superstorm.  Yeah, he's had to comment on the fact that he missed the call on that one.  Right.  Here, we can play the audio, actually. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  It'll work.  He's hilarious, Ira.  Hit it.  What happened with your hurricane forecast?  Because you said it wasn't going to be that bad.  Well, it came to the coast, and that's why we had a lot of rain, a lot of wind.  You said, go about your business.  Yeah, well, the storm went up to the New York area. 
[01:14:00]  That's not a forecast.  That's a postcast.  So when you said go about your business, you meant the business of cleaning up your destroyed house.  Cleaning up your destroyed house.  Right.  Oh, sorry.  I am predicting a snowstorm in mid-December after Thanksgiving.  We're going to be having a white Christmas.  A snowstorm.  What are you basing that forecast on, Ira? 
[01:14:30]  Basing that forecast on...  It's going to move.  We're going to get colder weather.  December, you're predicting colder weather.  Yeah, that's right.  Well, he needs a guarantee at this point after the...  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  It's Ira in an elevator.  That's right. 
[01:15:00]  Living it up when we're going down.  No, that's right.  Ira in an elevator.  That's right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  There's obviously some visuals in there, so check out the video for yourself.  He is so fucking funny when he's just like, that's right.  Yeah, there was a pan down to a nice ass.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I had to shush the receptionist because she called me out on filming that girl's ass.  Then he got him in the elevator. 
[01:15:30]  We'll put that on the Facebook page probably.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  All right.  That video will be up there for your viewing pleasure.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, that came out all right, man.  I'm pilfering some toilet paper.  Yeah.  From the apartment now that me and Travis are roomies.  Me and Travis.  One bed, huh?  Yeah, one big bed.  We just sleep together in there and cuddle.  Do you sleep in Anthony's bed, though, when you sleep there?  No.  Is there a guest room? 
[01:16:00]  Sleeps on the pullout.  Yeah, there's a pullout couch.  The pullout couch.  All right.  But it's addicting to do, right?  I never have anything over there.  Hold on a second.  I gotta steal the toilet paper.  Anthony is stealing toilet paper from work.  There's a stack of $1,000 chips in that fucking picture.  What's up, man?  What's up with that?  If you don't think Anthony is white trash, I can't stress enough what garbage he is.  And they have shitty toilet paper here, too. 
[01:16:30]  It's going to be shittier after I use it.  I was wondering why the toilet paper was lackluster over there.  Oh, you just thought you'd steal it from here?  I'm pilfering from the company.  I actually like thinner toilet paper.  I hate the cottony soft stuff.  It makes me feel creepy.  I don't like it.  You don't like really soft toilet paper?  Oh, it's the best.  But shoving a finger up your ass to clean it.  No, I don't feel as clean with the soft ones.  I hate that texture.  We had, what, we had nine to ten people in my house growing up, so we had the toilet paper that was the smeary kind. 
[01:17:00]  You know what I'm talking about?  Smeary kind.  It's the only way I could explain it.  It would smear.  Oh.  Just looks like you fucking have Nutella all over your toilet paper.  It would take, I mean, my mom, you know, we couldn't afford all the rolls of toilet paper we were going through, but we had to use a lot of the smeary kind to get the job done.  It's the only way I could explain it.  Smeary God. 
[01:17:30]  Like, it didn't just wipe everything nice after, like, one or two swipes.  I got you.  It just had to keep going, and it would just smear off.  That's terrible.  It was horrible.  I can't falter.  I can't imagine how many rolls we were going through a week in our house.  The truth of the matter is that I could go to the store and buy toilet paper.  I don't remember to do it.  When I was in the bathroom, I saw rolls of toilet paper, and I was like, oh, that's right, I need some for the apartment, so let me grab one. 
[01:18:00]  But, yeah, obviously, I just don't think of those things.  I assume they grow on the roll somehow.  Yeah.  At my house, like when Ange just puts them on.  You should have just left a dollar in the bathroom.  I might as well buck a roll.  We came back with Even Better Than The Real Thing, and I just looked at our sheet here.  21 years ago, Octung Baby was released.  Wow.  And for the 20th anniversary, obviously, last year, they did a little documentary that I really enjoyed.  What's Octung Baby?  One of U2's biggest albums.  Some would say their biggest album. 
[01:18:30]  Oh.  I think Joshua Tree was bigger in sales.  Maybe not.  What song did you come back to?  I just assumed that Joshua Tree sold more records than Octung Baby, but maybe not.  The song that I came back with?  Yeah, I was peeing.  Even Better Than The Real Thing.  How does it sound?  Even better than the real thing.  I probably heard it.  I find myself when I hear a U2 song, like, oh yeah, I've heard that somewhere.  They've had a few hits over the years, a few songs you might like.  This. 
[01:19:00]  He's shaking his head.  You've never heard this before?  I wouldn't be surprised if Jim hadn't heard this before.  Why, though?  But just walking around, you hear this stuff.  Yeah, but I...  You really have never heard this?  And I was online last night.  Look at his face.  He still doesn't know it.  Once it kicks in, maybe.  Give me one more chance, and you'll be satisfied.  No idea, huh? 
[01:19:30]  Nope.  Wow, that's so strange to me.  You know, and I was online on YouTube watching Irish folk singers last night, because I heard  a song in fucking Boardwalk Empire a couple weeks ago that I wanted to go and find the  version of it.  It's this Irish song.  You find it?  Yeah, yeah.  I was watching just different versions of it.  So let's play it.  I don't have...  I don't know the...  It's called...  Tell Me Ma.  It's some weird...  But I don't know whose version is better, because it's like from the early...  It might even be from the 1800s, so I don't know who it's supposed to be. 
[01:20:00]  A boy or a girl singing it?  What version did they play in Boardwalk Empire?  It was during a weird scene where the woman who plays Buscemi's girlfriend or wife, whatever  she is, sings it.  She's just singing it at like this family gathering, and it only showed it for a minute,  but I was like, I don't know, it's kind of catchy.  I don't want to hear it.  Yeah, Tell Me Ma.  Just go on YouTube.  Fine.  I'm going to see your version.  I know.  Everyone sings this fucking song.  Tell Me Ma. 
[01:20:30]  People are saying I...  Trade in some bad things and get good things.  Trade in your hookers for exercise.  No, it's...  Try the Dubliners, I'll Tell Me Ma.  I don't even know if this is the version.  That sounds like this?  No.  It's commercial.  Hey.  I'll Tell Me Ma when I go home. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Fucking drunk mix songs.  I love this shit.  Me too.  It can never be sad if you're listening to this type of music.  Singing about that potato fucking farm going under.  Not about the girls.  Oh.  Looks like Henry Winkler. 
[01:21:30]  Lead singer?  Yeah.  Pushy eyewitness.  That is real.  That is real.  Let me grab a night of all.  I don't need the girls alone.  But my hair is cold and cold.  That's all right.  It's about the home.  She's handsome.  She's pretty.  She's a bad adult.  I'm sick.  She's encouraging on to cheat.  He's only telling me who is she.  Hey.  It's catchy, right? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  It's catchy, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  It's catchy, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  It's catchy, right?  Yeah.  It's catchy, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, the Dubliners, this guy named Ronnie Drew, he's dead now, sang with them, and he  died in like 2008, I think.  He was a huge influence on all of them.  There's Bono, and they all love him.  A little house will come tumbling from the sky.  She's asleep in his apple pie.  She'll get her own and buy and buy.  When she gets a lot of her own, she'll tell a man when she gets old.  Let them all come as they will. 
[01:22:30]  It's out with the movies she loves gold.  That's the one guy behind there.  He was a little behind everybody else, wasn't he?  She's asleep in my mind when I'm old.  That's the one guy behind there. 
[01:23:00]  That's all right, it's the night of home.  She is handsome, she is pretty.  She is the man of the city.  She is the courteous to change.  These words, how beautiful is she?  Wow.  I love it.  I love it.  The Dubliners.  You see that fucking jig?  Yeah, it was very good.  The guy dancing.  It was amazing.  It was amazing.  I'll actually go on sometimes and just look for, like, I prefer Rodney Drew singing it,  but I can't find a good version of that.  That's a great version.  No, I know, but I like Rodney Drew. 
[01:23:30]  He's one of the fucking greatest voices ever.  I'll tell me Ma is the name of the song by the Dubliners.  I'll tell me Ma, you fucking whore.  I'll tell me Ma, she's got my hair in the closet with my Boy Scout uniforms.  I'll tell me Ma to get on medication because her fascination with me is unhealthy.  I'll tell my Ma to throw my toenail clippings out because I'm older and I've moved out of the house.  Did you like that song, Sam? 
[01:24:00]  No.  No, it's not you, huh?  I think it's interesting that you love the Irish folk song so much.  I can never get into it.  Why?  It's catchy.  That's supposed to be your people.  What's wrong with you?  Put the guy's name on your arm?  No, I wouldn't get his name tattooed on my arm.  You don't like Rodney Drew?  No, I don't like any of the Irish stuff.  Why?  I don't know.  It has never done anything for me.  If it's catchy, I'm in.  Bob Kelly almost.  If it's a stupid pop song that's catchy, I'm in.  I'll do pop, but I can't get into the Irish stuff at all.  For whatever reason.  That was catchy and just fun.  I can get into like the Dropkick Murphys or something. 
[01:24:30]  So I like one or two of those songs.  Everyone likes that fucking song.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Every movie.  Every movie is it.  Can we hear it?  That is a great fucking time.  Is it called Going to Boston or Going Back to Boston?  Yeah, let's just hear this for a second.  As far as Griffin's Walk-On song.  Is it?  Yeah.  Shipping Up to Boston.  What's that?  Shipping Up to Boston.  That one is in every fucking movie.  Yeah.  Every Irish fucking guy movie.  My sister married an Irish guy.  So guess what the big ending of the wedding. 
[01:25:00]  Of course.  This is what his family got on the dance floor for.  Oh, God.  It's a great song.  It was a good song.  Because it rocks.  It's Irish and it rocks.  I like that.  Just picture a soccer hooligans head-butting each other to this.  Come on.  I think these guys know a few sullies.  Oh, fuck.  Just a few, right?  A few murphs.  They murph. 
[01:25:30]  Are they Boston guys or Irish?  They're from Boston, huh?  They're going to beat up some Yankee fans.  I'm a South Park P and I lost my leg.  Climbing up the top sails, I lost my leg.  I like Boston Air Force.  Yeah.  That's all that's from Boston.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:26:00]  How do you rock up an Irish tune?  It's amazing.  They did it.  Yeah.  Great.  Ship it out to Boston.  Ship it out to Boston.  Ship it out to Boston.  Bostonians are so proud of Boston.  Yeah.  That's wild.  That's really wild.  They're so proud and unapologetic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I love it.  I love the attitude. 
[01:26:30]  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, they're assholes.  And that's a compliment, by the way.  Yeah.  They get a kick out of it.  Yeah.  Because they'll kick me.  They're a blue-collar, working-class bunch of slobs.  I love them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unapologetic.  Very good, Jim.  And that's a compliment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm out.  I'm out.  Ship it out to Boston.  Ship it out to Boston. 
[01:27:00]  Ship it out to Boston.  Ship it out to Boston.  I'm out.  Ship it out.  I'm out.  I'm out.  You're arrested.  It's like you're not trying to be good-looking at all.  No.  It's just like, fuck you.  Every guy in Boston has been arrested  Every guy  Has spent the night in jail  Just a bunch of scarred up hard ass  Fucking bald headed vests 
[01:27:30]  That's how you know by the way Bob Kelly is not Irish  Because we were going to Amy's  Party on July 4th  I had my mix on whatever  And one of the songs I played was fucking  The Dubliners and it was a version of  Now I'm Easy which Ronnie Drew  Sings and fucking Bob is like dude this is  Awful I don't like this dude  It's like of course you don't like it you're fucking you're Panamanian  Why would you like it  That shit should be in his blood  Exactly if it doesn't reach you  On some level you're not Irish  JD's saying fuck that song 
[01:28:00]  Flogging Molly  Fuck you I'm drunk better than the Dropkick Murphys  Flogging Molly  Flogging Molly  Can we play fuck you I'm drunk better  Better than Dropkick Murphys  I don't know about that  I don't have that one in the system  Maybe Sam does  Yeah I got it  There's way better  Sam's on the motherfucker  Fuck  Shit  God  Irish do love their booze 
[01:28:30]  It's all they sing about  Shrinking  Being Irish  Hanging out in fucking Dublin  Yeah  Or being loaded  Right  We get it  I walk in the bar  A bar of course  Order me up  Whiskey and beer  You ask me why I'm writing  The other song's better  You want a better Flogging Molly song  This one's not 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  Yeah we want the ones that kick in  Yeah  Yeah  With that great riff  That's pretty great  Huh  Yeah this is good  Yeah absolutely  Isn't that fucking  Good tempo there  See I don't like this stuff as much  Even though it's good  I like it better  All these bands make all their money  On St. Patrick's Day  Like they just do gig after gig 
[01:29:30]  On that one day  You don't like this that much  It's okay  It's not bad  But if I'm going to listen to Irish music  I want to hear some fucking  Deep throated Alky Croner  The Polk's I like  But not as much as I did at one point  I like their one tune  Or two tunes by them  But  No I prefer  If I'm going to listen  I want to hear like Eric Bogle  Or  I like fucking folk stuff  From Irish people  Like an eagle  No  Eric Nagel 
[01:30:00]  And now I'm heavy  Well we got clips from Roland's show  Over the weekend  We got clips from E-Rock's show  Over the weekend  But E-Rock's not here  Until December  But you said the intro is amazing  For E-Rock's show right  Yeah I figured we'd play the intro  And I also  Like you know  Because we made such a big deal  About his guests on Friday  I thought him  Introing Big O and Dukes  Big O and Dukes  Yeah  Okay  Well here's the intro  To  Baggling with the sex  E-Rock's radio show  From the murky waters 
[01:30:30]  Of West Palm Beach  Florida  Comes the coolest  Motherfucker  This side of Toontown  Ripping through the tides  In his brand new speedboat  Sun out  Shades on  Radio's most dangerous  Sniggle  Oh sex bagels  Puts his coat blow down  To wreak havoc  On all you little bitches  Oh my nigga  Sex bagels  Know how to beat that  Pussy  Picking up the ladies  Bikini girls only 
[01:31:00]  We wanna fuck you E-Rock  Ladies drop them panties  My dudes  Listen up  Knowledge is about to be  Dropped  Please welcome  To his very own show  The host of  Baggling with the sex  E-Rock  The sex bagel  That's when he comes in  I never heard that intro before  It's very well done  Few inaccuracies with it 
[01:31:30]  Why is his voice so low?  Why is he meek?  Thanks for putting that together  I am E-Rock  Hosting  I have to say this name  Baggling with the sex  There's worse names  There are  On the Opie and Anthony channel  If you wanna give us a call  866-969-1969  And through the magic of satellite radio  It's on your screen  So I don't need to tell you that anymore  What happened?  After that intro  Falls apart  What happened? 
[01:32:00]  I didn't think that was gonna happen  I thought the energy was gonna match the intro  After an intro like that  You punch in  Troy and me collab-o'd on that intro  And wouldn't let E-Rock hear it  Because we wanted it to be a big surprise  It was a good one  Do you wanna hear the big reveal  For his big surprise guest?  We did a whole  Oh god  Whole thing on it on Friday  Yeah  Yes  So finally it was time to reveal his secret guest  Well I got Chad Dukes on the after show  And Ant was in actually  And we were talking to him about him not knowing 
[01:32:30]  And that's when Chad Dukes told us  That E-Rock was having him up  Because he was having him and his partner Big O  You know to do their show on E-Rock's show  Right  Those guys are good guys  They're good yeah  They're really good  But it's supposed to be E-Rock's show  That was the disappointment  So E-Rock gets a radio show  As the guest for his radio show  Right  Oh  And then there was secrecy  Because he was trying to get me involved  So what  He wanted me to do radio with those guys?  Yeah  That's what he was hoping for? 
[01:33:00]  Bageling with the sex  To turn into Big O and Dukes  With their guest Opie  With Opie  Like load up the studio  With as many radio guys  And shows as you can  He refused to tell me who the mystery guest was  So I decided  Fuck it  I'm going to Target  Yeah  I went to Target instead  You did?  Instead of coming in here for this  Yes  I did an hour at Ronnie and Fez too  How was that?  Fucking great  Goddamn pisser  Did you make out with Fez?  No  Didn't make out with Fez  He seems to make out with people now  Yeah so you weren't really a guest on their show 
[01:33:30]  You're not a guest  You're a guest to make out with Fez  Yeah you're not officially on the show unless  Maybe I made out with Ronnie  Oh  That's fine  It was fucking a lot of fun man  It's not Gabe  It's Ronnie  Ronnie's great  So here's the big reveal from E-Rock's radio show  You know there are some questions  That have plagued man  Through the dawn of time  Since the dawn of time  Ah  Idiot  Did you just pick out every mistake he made?  No  But see I told Sam in the hall  That it's not fair  Because he's not here  It's hilarious  How could he fix that 
[01:34:00]  From the dawn of time?  The one reason why I like that clip  And E-Rock did a good show by the way  But the one reason why I like that clip  Was because  That was one of the few moments in the show  That you know was in his head  Like you know that he was like  Okay I'm going to intro the guests  By saying this  And so he had said this in his head  Funny  Multiple times  Coming out at fucking  Exactly  Tripped over a ho-ho  Yeah sure  You know we didn't do the Irish songs justice too  There's a whole bit there  Because there's a band called  Mudmen 
[01:34:30]  Who have a song called  Played  Their song's called  Sorry  Drink and Fight  Drink and Fight  That means wherever they go  There's going to be a problem  They love drinking and fighting  And then if people start fighting  They can't calm them down  Because their song is  Drink and Fight  Or maybe they're saying  Speaking against it  Oh it's wrong if you drink and fight  Just smile and have a cup of coffee  All night  We're Irish  That's my Irish song  That's a good one  It seems like these Irish bands  Are putting themselves in some situations  By the names of their songs  Yeah  Yeah  We can explore that on another day 
[01:35:00]  But now I need to hear  Drink and Fight  But first  E-Rock messing up  Yes  You know there are some questions  That have plagued men  Through the dawn of time  Since the dawn of time  I'll get on and drink a little bit  Who built the pyramids  Who really shot Canada  First of all  We know who built the pyramids  You dummy  The Egyptians  Egyptians  We know who shot Canada  It was Oswald  These are not questions  That are plaguing anybody  But you  No  No one's plagued  It's not the  It's Stonehenge  Right 
[01:35:30]  It's the mystery  Not the pyramids  Exactly  Right  Yes  How much do you weigh  That's a mystery  Plaguing floorboards  You know there are some questions  That have plagued men  Through the dawn of time  Since the dawn of time  It's how he jumps on the correction  That's the funniest part  How he jumped on it  Through the dawn of  Since the dawn  I gotta hear it again  It gets funnier every time  You know there are some questions  That have plagued men  Through the dawn of time 
[01:36:00]  Since the dawn of time  He didn't make a lot of mistakes  But that was the one  That was in his head  Yeah  And it's like  He was in his head too much  And he just  He was hoping to spit that out  He flubbed  Yeah  You know there are some questions  That have plagued men  Through the dawn of time  Since the dawn of time  You can tell I've been drinking a little bit  Who built the pyramids  Who really shot Kennedy  Who killed Laura Palmer  Who was the third man  To join the outsiders  Well today  We're gonna answer

[01:38:00]  That they hate  We hear the bed  He's trying to do  His own thing  That means we gotta  Play it again  Yeah let's hear the bed  Come on  I didn't catch the bed  We have to play it again  Yeah we'll cue up  Hit the button  Try the button  You know there are  Some questions  That have plagued men  Through the dawn of time  Since the dawn of time  You can tell I've been  Drinking a little bit  Pyramids  Who built the pyramids  Who really shot Kennedy  Who killed Laura Palmer  Who was the third man  To join the outsiders  Wasn't a mystery  Well today 
[01:38:30]  We're gonna answer  One very important question  And that is this  Who the fuck is that  You know what it is  He's a good guy  We like him to support him  But who is that  I have no idea  Who it is  I'm not kidding  I do not know  Who Chad Dukes is  Please welcome to the show  Big O and Dukes  From Washington D.C.  Dude  Hey now  Thank you for putting up  With that on Friday  I mean the worst was  You guys were editing it  In the back  And Oscar goes  Wow that's really brutal 
[01:39:00]  Yeah that was a beating  Of all beatings  Well I thought  I would leave you  With the Outlaw Country guys  Because you were  Having a good time  Over there  I figured I had enough time  Before you came back  And you walked in  Right on that  I can't even figure out  What he means  And the music bed's fine  Yeah it actually  It didn't sound bad  He's been showing  What's his name  Oscar?  Yeah Big O  Oh he means Oscar  Oscar  I didn't know that  They call him  Iraqo  Dude  We don't have to play  Any more clips  From his show right?  Oh please  One more 
[01:39:30]  Please  I think the only  Other stuff that  Sal pulled was  Eastside Dave  Went in  Eastside Dave's show  Went on after Eric  Oh boy  How long was Eric  On the air for?  An hour  52 minutes  But he had another  Radio show  And then he has  Eastside Dave as well  That's not fair  Yeah  Roland did you have  All these guests  When you did your show?  Roland  I was scared  Roland overbooked  To the upteenth degree  He did too?  Roland overbooked  Tom Cruise  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Yeah  He got like A-listers 
[01:40:00]  For his show  And then he puts it  Like what is it  Nine  It was at 915  But what about  The first one  He has to be out  By 912 for TV  Roland had  Roland had two  In-studio guests  Two in-studio co-hosts  Jesus  Two in-studio guests  Two phoners  And at least one person  That cancelled on him  At the last minute  Who Roland?  Oh no  Joe McKelph filming  Community  On a Saturday?  Joe McKelph  Joe McKelph filming  I heard it  Oh  I got that  Now who  Who do you have  As co-hosts? 
[01:40:30]  Julia from  All Nation  And the Cuban  It's not the station  She's on  Oh is it  XMU?  Yeah  My bad  Who's the Cuban?  He's a chef  That does consulting  He works with  Food Network  Okay  So and who are your guests?  Bert Kreischer  And Lucky Peach  I like Bert  Pete Peter Meehan  He works with David Chang  Of all the Mama Fuco  Restaurants  Okay  Bert was good  Wow Roland really planned  His show out  Yeah he did 
[01:41:00]  Roland did a great job  He didn't just call  Some radio show  And say hey  Come up and do my show  I didn't know radio people  They scare me  You want to play more  You rock  Or you want to go  I want to hear  Eastside Dave  Coming in  Okay  Pepper I just want to say  No disrespect to Dave  But Chad is a big  Pepper Hicks fan  Huge Pepper Hicks fan  When I said you guys  Might be coming by  First thing he said  Is Pepper coming?  Why'd you have to preface that  With no disrespect to Dave?  What the fuck is that all about?  I don't want you to feel  What the fuck am I doing here?  I don't want you to feel slighted 
[01:41:30]  He likes me  Not you  I wouldn't have even thought twice about it  Until you brought it up  No disrespect to Dave  It's like  Well now I feel fucking disrespected  Motherfuckers  I'll go down to D.C.  With a fucking shotgun  You know  That is brilliant  Because when you start with  No disrespect  You really aren't  Disrespecting  You're disrespecting  That absolutely is the truth  Who doesn't love fucking Dave?  I love him  He is hilarious  The company doesn't love him though  No  Bunch of fucking short sighted douchebags  Wouldn't give him his $5 an hour raise 
[01:42:00]  Or whatever the fuck he was asking for  How much was he asking for?  Technically I think he was asking for  About 100% raise  But  But 100% of  Of a shitty number  Yeah  Yeah  Poor guy  He would have taken 20%  That's your cough  Are you alright?  You feeling alright?  I'm getting better  I threw my back out though  That's what happens when you do bad cocaine  I don't know what you're talking about  Why would you bring that up?  Oh yes you do  I don't do drugs  Iraq  No offense  Hold on hold on  No I never did coke

[01:43:00]  From your rock show  They hang him off the elevator  They hang him off the helicopter  And plummets  They try to cut through him  And they can  Some fucking  He's hanging from the shower curtain  It breaks  Shower on bricks  It was the best  One more clip 
[01:43:30]  He was talking about video games  Or something  Yeah trying to get into video games  I guess  The sound design  Is actually my favorite part  Of the game  Do you ever play  Red Dead Redemption?

[01:45:00]  The E-Rock show  It was  E-Rock talking about  Radio with Big O  And Dukes  For the whole time  Yeah that's not  Your show  Now  That's what he chose  To do with his show  Right  He was a guest  On their radio show  He had to fit him  A little bit  That's what he decided  To do  The more I thought  About it  The more I realized  Like  People liked it  And if you want  To talk about  Like niche shows  E-Rock could do  A show  Called  Inside Radio  And just have  A radio show  On and talk  Some radio shit  Oh okay  That could be  A good show  And his guests 
[01:45:30]  Are people in the  Business  Other radio shows  Very good  That's not very good  That's my idea  He's not taking  My idea  On this channel  He already did  What do you mean  That's your idea  I want to get  Some old school  Radio guys together  And throw the  Fucking stories around  I mean we were  Talking Ronnie  Possibly Don  If he still  Doesn't hate us  Well listen  You've got  Don and Mike  I know Mike  Still hates us  Whatever  He does  He does right  I think so yeah  Get over it  Dick  You've got  That'll help  I know that was

[01:58:00]  I never read the magazine  I never read the magazine  I never read the magazine  I forgot to read it  He's like the Voltron  Of foodies  I fucking played  Call of Duty  I was like  I was going to read it  I meant to  He totally played  Call of Duty  I googled it  Your cat was dressed  Like Darth Vader  I'm sorry  You put a little  Darth Vader outfit  Now you have to read it  Some asshole wrote  It's like  It's more for  Celebrities  I don't know  Fuck it  That was really  Insightful though  I was like  Wow  My one question 
[01:58:30]  Is what is giggled  I giggled  I giggled it  Wow Roland  Higher energy though  Why did you  Why did you have to  Confess that you  Didn't read it  I don't know  It came out of  Nowhere though  I don't know  No one questioned  You or nothing  I know  It's in my head  I'm like  Do they know  I think they know  I'll just say it  You felt guilty  You interrupted somebody  I even hear it talk  I was like  I have a question  Yeah  Well you know  When you go to Philly 
[01:59:00]  And you know  They have a cheesesteak  People can't recreate  Philly cheesesteaks  Anywhere else  Why is that  Well it's very simple  I'm sorry  Go for it  I think that  The whole thing  With the Philly cheesesteaks  Is  There's no one  I have ever met  That's had a Philly cheesesteak  Brought to them  Somewhere in New York  Or New Jersey  Like someone that's traveling  It's been any good  It's all the environment  You're in Philly  It's crazy  There's the chicks  With the acid wash jeans  It smells like piss  It works 
[01:59:30]  Right  You know  It's all about environment  Food's all about environment  Speaking of piss  That is a Troy Kwan  A producer  Yes  What does that mean  I don't know  I was writing him little notes  To remind him to do stuff  Like  You know  If a voice came on  Right  Right  And mention who is talking  Sure  Just so people know Troy is there  And as he  As Troy was talking  I just held up a note  That says  Just say it's Troy  And then he let the Cuban talk 
[02:00:00]  And he  I guess in his head  Had to bring it back  So he goes  Speaking of piss  Speaking of piss  You know what I'm picking up on  It's going well  It is  As a structured show  It's going well  But then something happens  With Roland  Yeah  Yeah  He's getting in his own way  Yeah  The structure  Like he had a structure  Like that was going fine  And he was good with direction  And everything  Right  But then he starts to panic  And everything collapses  And then he picks it back up  Like a great example  He had a good interview  With the guy  With the magazine  But then all of a sudden  Had to blow up his own spots  No one would have known 
[02:00:30]  I didn't  Because it went so well  Giggle  Giggle  But that's why it works  In a strange way  It does  One more clip  From Roland's radio show  And now Roland  So let's do a quick speed round  Yeah  So I'm going to play  I'm going to play something quick  And just  You and the Cuban  Just tell us  What are your thoughts  Okay  Okay  So here we go  Best cheeseburger  J.G.

[02:02:00]  Than half of New York  I believe that  I'm not impressed  With New York City food  Some of it's really  Some of the finer restaurants  Are really good  Oh yeah  But I mean just down  And dirty shit  It's just okay  Where's the best  Mexican food in New York?

[02:03:30]  Something like  Troy goes  Or somebody said  Isn't the water  Makes the pizza in New York  I said not anymore  Because Hurricane Sandy  Except he didn't say  Not anymore  Like somebody said  I heard New York  Has good water  And then Roland  Responded by saying  Something like  Yeah they make the  Pizza water  Taste like shit  Because Hurricane Sandy  And then yeah  And then Roland's  Giggle afterwards  Of course  So are we going to  Do this again  With other people  Or  I don't know  I feel like the  Roland's food court 
[02:04:00]  Inside radio  With E-Rock  Lineup is pretty strong  He's not doing  Inside radio  That's my fucking thing  He did it  But he's not  Doing it again  He's got a pilot  You have an idea  He beats you  I'm going to get  Real radio guys  That were successful  In the business  No E-Rock's going to  Get current radio guys  Well that's fine  And he's going to  Do like you know  His radio stories  I think that's a good show  I think it's a rip off  Thank you  Whatever your name is  I'm tired too man  You're shot  I'm fucking shot  I almost called you Sam  I know 
[02:04:30]  I'm really fucking tired  Today  Jesus  That target  Fucking wiped me out  That would be a funny show  Roland's show  I mean a video  That would be a good show  On the Food Network  Or something  He knows his shit  You just traveling  And he has an unusual delivery  Obviously  Yeah  Just a regular guy  Eating food  But that would be bad for you  Like addiction wise  That's hard to not eat  When you're doing that  Like to fucking  If you have a food show  They're going to send you  To Blue Marble  And go  Can you do that again  And you're going  Alright  Radio programs 
[02:05:00]  Hate people like Roland  Because they don't have  The delivery  The voice  Any of that shit  They don't get it  But that's great  That's the shit  I would listen to  On the radio  In a second  Maybe we'll do it  Either in December  Or January  We'll do another  Food court  Inside radio lineup  Why would you wait  That long in December  Well I mean  We're not going to do it  In November  Because Thanksgiving  And then in order  No I mean  Why January  I'm saying do it in December  Just because I figured  The Christmas break might  Nah just throw  Throw them in there  Break it up  Who cares  Once a month for a while 
[02:05:30]  Until people are sick of it  Yeah  Which means no shows  In January  Is Bill Burke coming in today  He just checked in  I do believe  Oh that'll be good  What's it like  To have a creative mind  Working in  Programming the station  Oh boy  What are you talking about  Tooting his own horn  It's never happened before  Nobody's ever come up  With an idea  But the guys that  Oversee the channel  They come up with ideas  All the time right  This is Sam's idea  I don't think so  Fuck man  I always got Tim Sabian 
[02:06:00]  Tim Sabian comes up  With ideas for the channel  We got fucking guys  That keep track  Of our vacation schedules  The fuck  You get bean counters  Yeah  Yes  I do love Tim Sabian  And I've told  I've told the people in charge  I'm like  Why  Why does Howard  Get Tim Sabian  Who actually comes up  With ideas for the channel  And we got guys  That will fucking  Scold us  Because we've taken  Too many sick days  That's all  That's all they do  My mom made some dinner  My papa had  Jenna  Go look what I got  Fucking  My mom made some dinner 
[02:06:30]  Have they come up  With one idea  Over the years  I really don't know  Only like  Hey  Let's put this podcast  On the air  No that's us  Right  Right  That's you guys  What are you talking about  That was our idea  The Radio Wizard  Didn't come up with that  I'm asking for help  Because I have an advice show  A once a week advice show  That's coming on  Right  I think in a couple of weeks  We're premiering it  And we're trying to come up  With a name  And I'm asking for  Those guys behind the scenes  To help me with a name  Oh boy  And they've not come up  With a name yet  Yeah 
[02:07:00]  It's my responsibility too  Sure  I just can't think of a name  Alright Bill Burr is marching  Down the hall  So we'll take a break  And we'll have Bill Burr  Join the program next  Oh sometime today  I want to play my  Dr. Steve prank call  We just played  Going into break  Wait wait wait  You called Dr. Steve's show  Oh yeah  Did he know you were calling in  Uh no  What day was that  Um  Why all the questions  Saturday  Yes  So you went out of your way  To call Dr. Steve's show  Without him knowing  Right 
[02:07:30]  But  But E-Rock invited you  To his show  And you decided  Target was the place  Yeah yeah  Oh okay  I just wanted to get  Everything on the table  Actually as Bill Burr  Settles in  Just play the prank call  Alright let me pull it up  Basically Dr. Steve  Does a medical advice show  Called Weird Medicine  I was sitting around  Saturday  Bored off my ass  I couldn't figure out  What to do  Clean shirt I had  So before I went to Target  I actually called  I saw that he tweeted  The number for his podcast  So I called  Dr. Steve  As Ronnie from Charlotte  Ronnie from Charlotte 
[02:08:00]  516 area code  What's up bro  Big fan Dr. Steve  I lost a corner of my jaw  I was a big fan of your show  Thanks dude  I have a question  Okay  I have a rash  That goes from my wrist  Going all the way up to my elbow  Okay  And I'm trying to figure out  What it is  Okay 
[02:08:30]  And a friend of mine  Said that it could be  A form of sickle  And I find that weird  Okay  I haven't had sex  In quite a long time  Because of my medical condition  Yeah  And I'm trying to figure out  What the rash is  And if it's possible  That it's some kind of simpler  Okay  Now what's your underlying  Medical condition  You're having some  Difficulty breathing  So what's up with that  It's not that  I had difficulty breathing 
[02:09:00]  It's that I lost  A corner of my jaw  Okay  Okay  And it just  Makes it difficult  To talk  Okay  No problem man  I could breathe  I could breathe  I could breathe  I could breathe  It's that  I have to  Hold my jaw  And suck your leg  Yes  So I could talk  Okay  So I don't  I don't want to  Because it is  Quite painful  Yeah  Okay  Well don't talk anymore 
[02:09:30]  Than you have to bro  Here's the thing about syphilis  Let's talk about  Because  But I really want to  Get into it  Disfracking  Because  Like I said  Someone says  It could be a form of syphilis  Right  But I haven't had  Sex and quite  I don't  I mean  We've all heard  If you get syphilis  From a crazy  So I'm wondering  If it's possible  That I got this rash  And it is syphilis  Without having sex  Yes  Okay  Here's the story  Syphilis 
[02:10:00]  Can have  Late manifestations  So syphilis  Is like Lyme disease  You get an early rash  Which is called a shanker  Which is usually  A painless nodule  On the penis  Or vagina  That will divide  And divide again  So it'll be one nodule  Then it'll be two  And then four  And then it'll just go away  And then you have  This latency period  Just like you do  With Lyme disease  As well  And then  You have the tertiary phase  Where you can get a rash  And you can also get  What's called neurosyphilis 
[02:10:30]  Which is  Where the bacteria  Starts invading  The central nervous system  Now  And no one can tell  Just by looking at it  I mean  You know  They got poor Ronnie  Out there  And he's already  Having a rough time  And then some guy  Goes  Dude  That rash on your elbow  Could be syphilis  You know  Come on  You've just got to  Go to your doctor  And let them do a test  It's a real simple  Blood test  And if the blood test  Is negative  You don't have syphilis  And then they can  Go ahead  And treat  Whatever the underlying  Problem actually is  My friends say 
[02:11:00]  That it could be  Related to the fact  That they take a lot of  Baths  Now your friends  Your friend  Syphilis  I think  Okay  Stop listening to your friends  Yeah  Stop listening to your friend  Just ask us  Just stop listening to them  Go to your doctor  And get checked out  And let me know  What they say  Okay  No  He's not  He actually said  That it is possible  That you could  Dry out your skin  By taking too many baths 
[02:11:30]  But that  Could have somehow  Caused  A rash  That could cause a rash  But  That could cause a rash  But it's not going to  Cause syphilis  So  Anyway  Alright man  Hey email me  And if you want to  Continue this conversation  At weirdmedicine  At riotcast.com  And we'll go from there  And I really appreciate  You calling Ronnie  You're a good man  I'm thinking he was  For real  Yeah  I sort of get  But it's close  At first I was like  So you know  It's that fine line  Between is somebody 
[02:12:00]  Messing with you  Or are they for real  I think Ronnie was for real  That he's for real  So  You know there are  Some questions  That have plagued men  Through the dawn of time  Since the dawn of time  You can tell  I've been drinking a little bit  The Pepe Sinclair  News Company  Presents  Personal Hygiene  And You  A Beginner's Guide  You know  As we move into the future  Personal hygiene  Is becoming more and more  Important to our daily lives  Why look  There is Hollywood celebrity  Jim Norton  Mr. Norton  What is the most important part  Of your daily hygiene regimen

[02:16:00]  Devil's trying to make  That's a good one  Where the bad folks  Don't  They die  Don't go to heaven  Where the angels fly  Go to a lake of fire and fright  Sing them again  Until the 4th of July  MTV Unplugged  19 years ago  Wow  Talking about getting old  When MTV was awesome 
[02:16:30]  That was a tail end  That was about it right  Being awesome  They haven't been awesome  In 19 years  It's been a long time  A long long time  Well their Unplugged series  What a genius move that was  I don't know why  That ever went away  That never gets old  That was great  Although there were some bands  That you know  They were stretching it a little bit  They needed distortion  And electronics to sound good  It really exposed  Unplugged warrant  You know  Didn't quite cut it  Yeah but that guy could still sing  And those guys could still play  I'm trying to think who it was  There was a couple 
[02:17:00]  Towards the end  It's almost like the half hour specials  When they ran out of like headliners  And now they're like  Having like hosts come on  Right right  Like if Venom Unplugged  Yeah  Maybe they spread themselves too thin  Yeah  Do you know who's good?  Brian Adams  You hear Brian Adams unplugged?  Well he could sing  That fucking guy could sing  I was never a big fan of his  But I mean you could tell  The guy could sing  How many times did he fire  The person who told him  To try that glam thing  That he did for half a second  Yeah  He started off  And for the songs he was playing 
[02:17:30]  For pop  It was good  It was good  It was good music  Summer 69  And all that  I still like those songs  Sure  And then  Then he went into the chick music  Everything you do  I do it for you  And then it's like  That lost me  So he's like  Well now what do I do?  So hey why don't you put some eyeliner on  And spike up your hair?  What was the song from that era?  I don't even remember  I don't remember either  I just saw it  And I was just like  I remember he did try that  Yep  Some of these guys  I never saw him again  Some of these guys  Get kind of talked into  Following the hot music trend  Yeah 
[02:18:00]  It even happened to Ozzy  For a split second  And then he realized  What am I fucking doing?  He survived the 80s  When he had the fucking  The shot in the dark video  Yeah  With the doves  And the big robe  And his fucking bare foot  Right  But he survived  Fucking Ozzy was a trooper man  He fucking  He survived the 80s  That was funny man  But he was standing on  Like what he was standing on  Before he did that  If that was early in his career  That would have been over  He had like a Bette Midler hairdo  But we're like  You know what  He did sing Iron Man  I'm gonna give him a pass  On this song  Yes  Not the song  Then he got rid of that hair 
[02:18:30]  And he never went back  To any of that shit  Was that the ultimate sin album?  Yeah  Yeah  Whenever he was singing  About nuclear war  And had a message  People get influenced  The one we like to bring up a lot  Is Rush  Roll the bones  With the rap  Oh with the rap  When rap  Rap and rush  When rap really started  To become something  White people started listening to  They got caught up in it  And they tried their rap  And rolled the bones  I'm like  What are you doing?  See  This is the only time  I ever hear  This is Rush 
[02:19:00]  Who is rapping?  Fab Five Freddy  No  Don't tell me Neil Peart  No I think it's  What's his name?  Alex Lifeson  Alex Lifeson I think  For real  I think so  I would have loved to have heard  All three of them  Trying to see who  Raps the best  Right  Who's going to do the rap part?  You know  Who's taking this track?  Right  They either all fought it  And said I'm better  Or they all fought it  And said no  It's got to be you  Yeah  Yeah  But they all  Either the winner did it  Or the loser  It's terrible  It doesn't  It doesn't 
[02:19:30]  Oh come on  It doesn't suck  But it just  It stinks  It's not Rush though  It actually sounds like  The beginning of a bad  80s movie  Right  Yeah  Yeah  That's terrible stuff  It's Rush  He got talked into some shit  Like more recently  Was that whole  LeBron James decision thing  You know he didn't come up  With that shit  That just reeks of  Agent publicist  And we'll have an hour long  Of just you  Saying where you're going  Alright man  Alright he's playing like  Dominoes or something  Alright yeah  That sounds quite tough  But how clueless is he  That he didn't understand  How important he was 
[02:20:00]  To Cleveland  He's a kid  He's like 24  25  And the argument  Because it comes up  A lot on this show  He had every right  To go to Miami  Yes  It was the way he did it  He had no idea  That he was everything  To that city  He should have just left  Which is rare  This is kind of an old story  But yeah  I know  But that's why people  Got so fucking pissed  At the guy  Well he made cities beg  And then he chose  The trophy wife  Right right  Down in  And then they got  Their fucking trophy  I'm sick  It was a good move though  I mean  I love that they were going  Year after year  Without winning  As long as the Lakers  Don't win I'm happy 
[02:20:30]  Miami is still  An expansion franchise  To me  They got two banners  I don't care  I don't care  We got 17  I saw you  I saw you tweeting  About the Lakers  They're in a bad spot  This year  And then they don't  Go with Phil Jackson  They'll be fine  Why didn't they  Grab Phil Jackson  Because I think  He wanted like  A foot massage  Every game  And he didn't want  To go on the road  He said he didn't  But I don't buy that  Yeah there was talk  The Zen master  There was talk  That he wouldn't  Have to go on the road  He would just like 
[02:21:00]  Kind of like  Coach the home games  Which isn't a bad concept  How do you do that  That's terrible though  You can't  Either they're coaching  Or not  Well not when  The guy's getting older  And they sort of want him  But he doesn't want to come back  That's not the worst deal  In the world  There's no way  He was negotiating that  There's nobody in the history  He could Skype  He could Skype from home  Roger Clemens  The only guy I saw  Was able to do that  He didn't go on  If he wasn't starting  He wouldn't go on the road trips  I think when he was with the Astros  Well don't you think  It was kind of dumb  For starting pitchers  To go on the road ever  Why would you  Well in case they need you 
[02:21:30]  Not in April  In case you're losing  One of those 18 to nothing games  When somebody blows out their arm  Yeah but you know what  April  I mean maybe when  It's really starting to get  Important  But you're a team  You don't want to separate  You're already financially  You're in a different league  Than the rest of them  It's like you don't  Look like A-Rod  It's just such a twat  These guys had to travel  To cities knowing  They were not going to play at all  It's so strange to me  That's great  And then they got their  Road pussy out there  They just hang out  Eating chicken  Drinking beer like the Red Sox  But I'm just saying  When these pitchers got older 
[02:22:00]  And they're settling down  And all that shit  Why not let them hang out  In their house  And be all rested  For their next start  Because  You're getting paid  All that money  They want you to show up  To work  Well you know the road sucks  And then also  Yeah and all the other plays  We go how come he doesn't  Get to go  And blah blah blah blah blah  And my elbow doesn't feel good  I don't want to go  And then they're playing  Ping pong with Clemens  And the fact of the matter is  They're fucking  When they're there  At the game  They're not somewhere  Where they could  Fuck their arm up 
[02:22:30]  They're not sailing  And getting hit  With a jib in the face  Or fucking you know  Taking a boat trip  In Cleveland  Exactly  That was not good  For the pitching staff  No  Using a hedge trimmer  And cutting your fucking  Little finger off  Alright I guess you're right  Yeah when someone  Pays you that much money  They want you to come to work  That's like  Even if you do like  A TV show  It's only tapes one day a week  They'll figure out  Why you have to be there  Five days a week  Yeah  Just come in and shoot  A couple of promos  Yeah  Exactly  Yeah they're just gonna  Make you just fucking  Sit there 
[02:23:00]  Yeah  What are you doing in town  By the way  What am I doing in town  I did a  You're from LA  So it's not like  You jumped in your car  And said I'm gonna go  See the guys  I almost forgot  I did a college gig  Okay  Up in Connecticut  And then I came down here  To you know  Check on my apartment  Make sure it's okay  Nice  From all the storm disaster  And all that shit  Everything's fine  Everything's fine  Thank God  And then I'm going  I'm going to my high school  25 year high school reunion  Oh shit  When is that  I don't know  Friday or Saturday 
[02:23:30]  Oh it's this week  Yeah  It's always like the day  After Thanksgiving  Is it really  Yeah  I guess because people are off  Yeah because everyone's home  So they figure that's the best time  Trying to get everyone together  I went  I went to the  30th  Oh you went to the 30th  Yeah  15 years ago  How was it  I stopped going to mine  It was crazy  I bailed  It was just  It was a good time  I'm thinking it's gonna be a good time  It was weird  Why was it weird Anthony  Because you're  Oh  Alright 
[02:24:00]  Because my date was  My date was 18  No she wasn't  Yes she was  Yes she was  How great is Anthony  Good for you  It was hilarious  What was that  Did you get  He must have got looks  High fives  And dirty looks  Guys loved it  The girls hated it  Yeah  I always knew he was a creep  And all the girls looked like  Their mother's version of  What they  Like they looked  Like the girls I remembered  But like their mothers  It's like  They were all 
[02:24:30]  You know  It's like oh that chick was hot  Now she's just fat  And old  And you're like  Shit  It's kind of depressing  I'm not exactly a spring chicken  No I realize that  You know  I wasn't going into it  Thinking you know  Here comes Brad Pitt  To his fucking  High school reunion  Believe me  But it was just  Weird  I was going to improv  A Brad name  And I realized  Nobody would recognize it  So I bailed  Oh no you should do it  Good job  I've always loved your stuff  Go ahead  You know what  You know what  Do it again  It's not like  Brad Pitt 
[02:25:00]  Certainly not  Very good  It's more like Brad Dourif  See that would have  Bombed horribly  Who's Brad Dourif  You just echoed the sentiments  Of fucking 200,000 people  No no no  I'm interested  Who's Billy Bivitt  In Cuckoo's Nest  He's the antithesis  Of Brad Pitt  Yeah he was the stutterer  Who punched his own penis  That's actually a great reference  It really is  That's on us  For not getting  Yeah  No I'm hoping  It's going to be good  And I figure 25's  A good one to go to 
[02:25:30]  Where people  You're still kind of young  Right  Yet you're not young  But you're not old  And I  You know  I think people will still have  You know  The light in their eye  That's all I want to see  You just want to see the light  Well I was nervous that you know  I had a great grade  And everybody was cool  Like I had a real  Like mellow grade  We went like  I was talking on my podcast  How like the grade above me  And the grade below me  They were maniacs  They were good guys  But I mean  Every weekend  There was some  12 on 12  Battle royal  It seemed  There was a kid  In the grade above me  His party trick  Was he would eat a light bulb 
[02:26:00]  Wow  He would just sit there  Munching on it  And his gums would be bleeding  He'd be smiling  With the blood  In between his teeth  Oh my god  And somebody finally goes  Yeah dude  He had to stop  Yeah cause he's eating glass  Yeah  I get it  Yeah  And you didn't have  Any of that shit  You guys were pretty mellow  Huh  We had some tough kids  In my grade  Without a doubt  But like  You know  It wasn't me  But  I kind of dragged  The average down  But  No we were  Like a party in grade  Were you popular though  Like did you  Did you kind of  Socialize 
[02:26:30]  And were you the funny guy  Or were you kind of  I wasn't popular  And I wasn't  A loser  I was sort of  Hey he's a good shit  He's alright  Oh god  I was in the middle  You described me too  Yeah  Right there  Just kind of right there  I was hilarious  It's not like  I meet people from high school  And they're like  Oh yeah yeah  I can see how you became  A comedian  They always go  I remember you being quiet  I can't believe  This is what you do for a living  I get that a lot  I get that  I won class clown  By a landslide  But they wouldn't give it to me  Because I was in rehab  After a suicide attempt  So I figured I wouldn't look good 
[02:27:00]  In the yearbook  But your class clown  Was based after Gacy  Are you really the class clown  I didn't even know this  Yes I was  No kidding  It was a landslide  I find comedians are like that  They either were completely  There's no middle ground  You're either like  I can't believe it  Or Patrice was class clown  Oh sure  No one was class clown  Almost a year with this Patrice thing  Yeah  Fucking year of the 29th  29th of this month  It doesn't 
[02:27:30]  It doesn't resonate that it's a year  Because I think about him every day  It's like you don't realize  It's not like I'm going to look back  And go oh my god  I haven't thought of him in a month  You know what I mean  It's like when someone is omnipresent  In your fucking mind  Yeah yeah  It doesn't mean anything  I watch those clips online  All the time of him on this show  Thank god  Because you get to watch like  Hours and hours of him  It's awesome  I have a picture of him  Like to the right of my refrigerator  On a shelf and stuff  It's like every day  I look and go  Ah fucking guy man  Yeah  I have a great pic of us 
[02:28:00]  From a tough crowd  That I want to put up  Me and him laughing on the couch  Yeah yeah  Yeah I know  You kind of get like bummed  Once again  Why I'm going to my 25 year one  Because I don't want to go there  Hey where's so and so  Ah  Ah yeah  Cement mixer  Yeah  Had his iPad on  iPhone whatever the fuck it is  The worst thing that happened  To anyone involved  In my high school class  Oh jeez  Was they slept with you  This guy 
[02:28:30]  And this is  I went to kindergarten  And then through  Like I moved around the country  And stuff like that  And around Long Island  But then I returned  For like junior high  And high school  So I knew these guys  From kindergarten  And then I knew them again  In junior high and high school  After high school  This one guy  Went over  The other guy's house  His mom was there  He fucking raped  And murdered the mother  And then tried to burn 
[02:29:00]  The house down  To fucking cover it up  Sick  Wow  Was he a nice guy in school?  He was a little  Fucking rambunctious  A little off  Let's say  He raped the guy's mother  And killed him  He raped and killed  The guy's mother  At the time  I guess just out of high school  Oh just out of high school  Are they still friends?  Oh my god  We had a kid  When I was a senior  Killed another kid  Just to see what it was like  Wow that's fucked up  Yeah  I think he's  That's fucked up  I think he's just getting out 
[02:29:30]  Jesus  We had a kid  That would follow  Cars home on the LIE  And rob him in the driveway  And well  One of those  Botched robber  It was a Botched robbery  Oh I remember that guy  Yeah  And he got shot  In the back of the head  And then his  His partner there  Just dropped him  In the car off  In the back of the  Walt Whitman mall  To die  Kid I went to high school with  He was alive huh?  Yeah but you know  The guy didn't want to get in trouble  For you know  That's some twisted shit  And assumed this guy 
[02:30:00]  Was in deep trouble anyway  So he fucking  Ditched him in the car  At Walt Whitman  And took off  He was one guy  That killed someone  So what happened to him?  The other guy?  He gets charged  I don't know  I didn't know the other guy  We just knew  The guy that died  Is someone we went to school with  He would have to have  Got in charge  I would imagine  They got him  There's gotta be  Some sort of charge  For walking away  From some guy  With a  Yeah they found  If they were both  Involved in the robbery  And that guy got shot  He's up for fucking murder  Yeah  Even though he didn't  Wait who got shot in the head?  The guy I knew 
[02:30:30]  From high school  One of the guys  One of the robbers  Right?  Yeah yeah  So how are you charged  With murder?  A death  During the commission  Of a felony  But do you count  If you're one of the criminals?  Yeah  And I didn't realize  We were gonna talk about this  Whether you shot him or not  Even though the guy died  During the commission  Of a felony  You get the murder rap  Even though he was your pal  You fucking  Didn't shoot him  Yeah I believe  You get the murder rap  And that fucked up  And what's your defense?  I didn't do it  I didn't do shit  I believe  The person who were robbing  You know  Was armed  Yeah  And shot back  I believe 
[02:31:00]  Because it's been many many years  I didn't realize  Now your friend's dead  And you charged  With his murder  Even though you didn't do it  Oh the kid definitely died  With a fucking gunshot wound  That must have been  A rough night's sleep  In a car  Just trying to lay there  Like  At the mall  Okay  Maybe they'll think  He got shot at the mall  Oh god  In the passenger seat  Yeah  Waiting for someone  Yeah  I think that was our worst one  That I know of  That's a pretty bad one  But you lose touch  With everybody  So you don't know  There's always a drinking  And driving accident  There's always  Something  And then there's a good 
[02:31:30]  Ten years stretch  And then something  There was a midget  In my class  And he was actually  At the reunion  And he died like  Just after the reunion  I was so surprised  To see him around  He's like  Walking around  This little midget  What happened  What fell on him  He turned  He turned out to be  Like he was  Very active in politics  I think he was  Part of like  The Clinton administration  Everyone's part  Of the Clinton administration  I know  Everyone you come across  He was just a little fidgety guy  A little fidgety guy  What did he die of?  Fidget  Died of midget  Yeah it's just sadness 
[02:32:00]  You would think  That they would live longer  You'd think  Because I know tall people  They don't live long  For some reason  They get born  With the same size heart  So it has to work  Really hard  To get it all the way  Down to their little  Twinkle toes there  And you would think  Being that compact  Right yeah  That they would just  Have blood fucking  Pouring through them  But it doesn't circulate  Coming out their fucking ears  So if you're an older  Tall guy  Why wouldn't you just  Cut off your legs  At the knees  Oh man  So your heart  Doesn't have to work  As hard  No you need  You need a little bit  Of work  To stretch out the blood 
[02:32:30]  Like when you bite  Past the heater core  Right  Well you know  It's happening  You know your heart  Is overworking  So why not  You know  You get to an age  Where you're like  I'd rather live  A few more years  You know  I'll do it from a wheelchair  Bill Russell's like  The only 70 year old  7 foot guy  I've ever seen  It's funny  Because when  You always hear  A little old lady  A little old man  Right  When you see  An old tall guy  Walking around Manhattan  You do realize  Immediately  You're looking at something rare  You're so right  Yeah  But you'll see old people  All the time  But they're just shorter  There aren't old tall people 
[02:33:00]  Tall people  It's not old  Like fat people  It's those little fuckers  Who got picked on  In the playground  Screaming motherfuckers  Yeah the twerps  Yeah old fat people  Never  Twerps  Old tall people  Never  Little people  Evidently not  You want to be right  In that 5 foot 6  5 foot 7  5 foot 8  Put our fucking height  In there Bill  What are you doing to us  I don't know  5 11ish  But we got the anger  Yeah  Oh that's good  We have like the bruised veins  The anger  I like to think  That's just pushing the cholesterol  Through my body faster 
[02:33:30]  In a good way  I've been reading this book  Eat to live  Right  I'm blowing my mind  It's about pussy  I think eat to live  Was on the  New York Times bestseller list  I think that's a popular one  Eat to live  Yeah well how do I talk to that  I can't even tell you why  That's not right  That's not right  Holy shit  Why is the book  Blowing your mind  Because what they're claiming  Is that  The whole four food groups  I feel like I'm going to get  Hung up on  This is how 
[02:34:00]  No  No one's ever interested  In what I'm saying  Oh really Bill  Why don't you elaborate  Hello  They're saying that  The four food groups  Things  Where they  Put the stress on  A protein  And dairy  Was actually  Came about  By the meat and dairy  People came up with that  Oh really  So what you're supposed to do  Is it's supposed to be  More like salads  And greens  And that type of shit  And then  You almost flip the pyramid over  And I'm thinking  I'm going  Well wait a minute  Then I'm going to lose  All my muscle  And that type of thing  And the guy's got  A great argument  He goes 
[02:34:30]  Go to the zoo  And look at gorillas  Alright  Who look like  Supersized linebackers  You know  They eat 80% vegetables  And 20% fruit  Does he have any examples  From our species though  That's like  Peanuts are apparently good  Because elephants do well  No no no no no  If he said a cockatoo though  But if he said a cockatoo  We've all been guilty  No  Dude  I'm going to tell you what  Because that's what I was thinking  Like dude  This is literally a different species  Two things  You go to a monkey  And you look it in the eye  At the zoo  There's no fucking  You're like  Dude that's me 
[02:35:00]  That's me  With just a little bit of  A little bit of something else  Thrown in there  You see something in their eyes  Yeah there's something in their eyes  They know they're in the zoo  They know they're being watched  They don't like it  And they'll rip your fucking face off  The same way I would  If I was sitting in a cage  Like come a little closer  Motherfucker  Just do it  So  And that was this thing  All these diets I've tried  And I always ended up  Feeling like shit  This one actually  I feel fucking great  You lose weight  I feel like energy  Yeah  How do you not lose weight  Eating like a fucking rabbit  Are you eating fish though  Because I've tried to eat  Grilled chicken is one of the only meats 
[02:35:30]  I'll really eat  I eat a lot of greens  And drink a lot of vegetable juice  And shit  Dude I would literally  If I became a vegan  I would still go to a steakhouse  Once a week  I can't help it  And smoke a cigar  Wait so what aren't you eating  What aren't you eating  No I'm just doing like  Like just like breakfast and lunch  I just stay away from the shit  That I used to  Those lumberjack things  Yeah the fucking  Big egg sandwich  Ugh  Yeah all that stuff  Yeah that feels good  As you're eating it  Yeah  And then afterwards  You feel like you have that bag  In your stomach  Let me have two eggs over easy 
[02:36:00]  On a roll  With the cheese  And fucking bacon  We've been doing a bacon thing lately  Out of nowhere  Bacon's the greatest thing ever  But I told Anthony  It goes to your point  I told Anthony  We ate a bunch of bacon  I think it was Friday  And immediately  You feel like shit  Yeah  You're not on health  Is there anything better  Than just burned up bacon  It's the best  Bright crispy  Oh it's the greatest fucking thing ever  But you feel greasy  And just shitty  Immediately after you  Even pigs enjoy it  Right  You know they smell it  They're like alright we get it  Yeah  But I'm so old 
[02:36:30]  I can't have a breakfast  That has syrup  Or I'll be nodding off  By 11  Syrup's good though man  I just need one of those  Old man hats  Oh if I have pancakes  With french toast  Which I fucking love  It's over  I'm done by you  I would eat blueberry pancakes  And bacon every day  You get that sugar rush  Every fucking day  Is there anything worse  Than when they say  They have blueberry pancakes  And they just make regular pancakes  And then they just  Pour the shit on top  That's bullshit  Yeah that is it  I want more blueberries  Than fucking pancake too  No it's gotta be in there 
[02:37:00]  Yeah exactly  I want equal distribution  Of blueberries in this muffin  Do you know how long  That's going to take  That was such a great response  He's beside himself  He wanted to say you cunt  But he couldn't  So he asked this question slowly  Do you know how long  That's going to take  Like are you out of your fucking mind  No but I actually  Yeah  Of just the shit that I've been reading  This is the first  And he has  He has like  What's great  He has like  40 pages of the book  Is just footnotes  From shit that this guy's actually 
[02:37:30]  He's done all the reading for you  And I don't know  It's been working for me  Yeah  You still gotta do it though  It's easy to read that shit  But then you start  Trying to do it  Dude the first three days  Of sitting there  Eating a salad  I wanted to fucking kill myself  And halfway through  The third day  It's weird  It's like drugs  Acceptance  You actually start going  Like oh tomato  No  You start  Swear to god  Wow  You start craving it  I've been eating salads  Without dressing on it  Holy shit  Yeah that's fucking  It's crazy  It's hardcore  But then after  Yeah literally  No man  That's how I eat my salads  Eat like a rabbit  Shit like a horse  Really good salad 
[02:38:00]  The flavorings in the vegetables  You don't really need the dressing  Meal in meal out  That's where I am right now  It's fucking ridiculous  No but I like them  I'm always afraid  It doesn't taste  I like washed vegetables  When I eat them  Like I don't like them  To taste dry  Like dry  That's where you get  You get the little  Fucking crank thing there  Jimmy  What's that  You put the lettuce in there  You hose it off  Oh yeah  I don't  Centrifical  For like that ride  At the carnival  Yeah yeah yeah  Except nobody pukes  Do you eat chicken in it  Or anything  I don't like to have it  I like a little bit  Of grilled chicken  In my salad 
[02:38:30]  I try to go  The breakfast and lunch  Without doing the meat thing  And then  Then by fucking dinner  I eat like a fucking  Animal  An envelope  Taking down prey  With fucking  Bite to the throat  No because I don't  Give a shit  If it's  You gotta live  So I figure  I'm offsetting  You know like kale  And that type of stuff  Is great  So I offset it  And then at night  I throw it out  And I try to have  A good cut of something  Dude it's two thirds  Less of eating like shit  You know it's  Two thirds of your meal 
[02:39:00]  Oh an animal  Fucking took one  In the face  Every fucking  Every meal I had  It was over  It got choked out  I ate a pig  I ate a pig at breakfast  A chicken or a cow  For lunch  Every day  And then for fucking dinner  I ate another cow  Or a chicken  Maybe a fish  Maybe I punched a trout  In the face  I have a fish  Don't care  No no no no no no  Three times a day  Do you think fish care  Yes  Do they have any clue  Yeah they do  And I also think  Lobsters feel it  I agree  I'm with you with the lobsters  I don't eat lobster 
[02:39:30]  Because of that either  Or crab  Occasionally  I eat fucking crab  You gotta eat that  You gotta eat that lobster  I fucking  You gotta  Come on  Just knock the fucking thing  On his dumb shell head  That's giving their life  That's what I had  How hard is that  Crush his head  With a fucking hammer  That  That mope  That releases what  Something that makes  The fucking meat  No it doesn't  They're just saying  That they're full of shit  They're just saying  That to make it  Fucking more humane  That they're killing it  You could flick a lobster  In it's jaw  And you'd knock it out  All you gotta do  Is just get it to  Rattle around in the fluid  Flick him in the jaw 
[02:40:00]  He's down  He's down  You hold his claw up  Like the Hulk  Goes down  And then it stays up  Yeah  Fucking put rubber bands  Around its claws  Can you imagine  That's like you being tied  With your hands  Behind your back  And old boy  He doesn't feel anything  You think that would  Stress out the lobster  So it's already stressed  Which means it's  Releasing all that shit  There's gotta be some douche  That's gonna write in  About their fucking  Neurological system  And the reason  I don't buy it  If you eat lobster  You should be able to  Handle it without  The fucking rubber bands  On its claws 
[02:40:30]  That should be the challenge  To you  You're gonna boil something alive  You can't have it declawed  Right  If nature puts claws on it  To protect it  That means it obviously  Can feel something  Like anything that can't feel  Doesn't have a natural defense  That's just genius  Like claws  You think a jellyfish  Really has a fucking  Intelligence to it  Maybe not intelligence  But they still  You don't need an intelligence  To feel  Fish  Pain I don't think  You know how funny that was  Did he do anything  From this species  Yeah  Hey  Elephants eat peanuts 
[02:41:00]  Peanuts  Treats them pretty well  I really am a dope  Anything I read  I believe  No but it's  You know  Look  I'm trying to eat good  And drink a lot of  Vegetable juice  It's not my idea  I've heard it  Over the years  I drink vegetable juice  Every day  I drink beet juice  Beet carrots  Fucking kale and parsley  Or lemon and ginger  What about that guy there  The juice guy  Who dressed like  Arthur Fonzarelli  Before he did  He had that mechanic  Onesie  The juice master  Onesie  He used to wear  The coveralls  Yeah the guy  Who used to lift himself up  In the pike position

[02:51:30]  The long version  It's a five day fucking match  You thought baseball was boring dude  Five days  Who thought of this shit  Five  Dude this is before the internet  And you had shit to do  But how do you go to an event  That's five days long  And it's a regular game too  It's not like the playoffs  It's like the Olympics  I have no idea  How many hours a day  Will they play it  Like if it's a five day event  What is it like an eight hour thing  Or a three hour thing  Oh shit  I don't know  But it's funny though  But you go there  And people are into it  And they start talking  And they sound like 
[02:52:00]  They're talking about the Brewers  And you just  Sports fans just have  That sports fan vibe  And they get mad  At certain players  And they say they suck  I don't know why we have a guy  I mean just laughing  This guy's fucking  Amped up about cricket  He's talking about my Jets  Dude I'll show you  If you guys pull it up  One of the worst sports  I've ever seen in my life  Is it's called netball  Wait  I know netball  Hold on a minute  It's like women's basketball  Where you can't dribble  Right  Hold on  So that there's like  Three quadrants  Yeah  That's how jet lagged that was  I was actually reading about netball  Hold on Bill 
[02:52:30]  Before we move on to netball  Did you like cricket  I could actually see myself  Gradually getting into it  Wow  It's at the same sort of pacing  Of baseball  Where it's like  Alright put your feet up  Have a couple of beers  Shoot the shit  I never understood  There it is  Then there's gotta be  Somebody throwing junk  Like a Gaylord Perry guy  Who's cheating  He's got something on his  His thighs  And you're gonna like that guy  It's the oil  If it's not a kangaroo pouch  Some fucking weird fluid  That we don't have here  Oh by the way  Kangaroos  Not cute at all 
[02:53:00]  No  Not like the cartoony ones  Did you pet one  No fuck that  No they were  They look like giant fucking rats  With an agenda  Really  They're aggressive  Dude their head is  You know like whenever they show  Like the classic  Like cowboy scene  Where there's that  Fucking longhorn skull  So you know that you're in  Tumbleweed Junction  Or whatever  Right  Their head looked like that  With just flesh and eyeballs  Oh shit  Yeah  Like bony looking  Why didn't you pet one  Why would you  They're vicious aren't they 
[02:53:30]  Are they mean  I don't know why  Yeah no  And evidently even their front  Fucking claws  They got them claws  Yeah  They can gut you  They like kick you  Yeah they can disembowel you  They're fucking nasty  That's why they do that  When they put the boxing gloves on them  Probably so you don't get disemboweled  But I went to the zoo  And saw all their psycho fucking  Aren't  Isn't there a lot of kangaroos  They're reptiles  Right there  That's a taipan  Holy shit  That's a good two steps  And you're done  Wow  That's a snake  Really  Yeah they had a snake there  That had enough venom  To kill 200 mice  And I was like  You know  Thinking like 
[02:54:00]  Why is that  I guess it's cause  Food is so scarce  That you gotta  It's gotta be a kill shot  If you  You miss  You're dead  Yeah you're gonna die  So uh  Plus so many other snakes  Probably came upon a bunch of mice  And only killed one  And they're like  What the fuck  I had more venom  I could have eaten for six weeks  Bill aren't there kangaroo  All over the place too  I heard kangaroo roadkill  Like you get that shit  Supposedly they're all over the place  If you go  I mean I was like  In the city  So it's not like  They're gonna be hopping around  But like 
[02:54:30]  If you get more out  I think they're kinda like  They're deer  Really  Do people hunt them  And eat them  There  Absolutely  I would think so  But I wouldn't  Like that's more like  You know  People hear  I eat possum soup  Yeah yeah  I think it's delicious  Like ah you gotta have  Some kangaroo  Like I'm sure there's like  Yeah there's some sort of  Australian redneck show  Where they're out there  Yeah  Do they have big feet  They have giant feet  Don't they  Yeah yeah yeah  They got those big long feet  With the claws on them  Did everyone go up at the end  When they talk  Did they do that old thing  I was actually 
[02:55:00]  Up at the end  I've already lost it  I was starting to pick it up  But uh  Yeah  No but they were great man  They were really  Cool peoples  Yeah and they  And they kinda had like  A Boston accent  Ha ha  Beer  We go beer  Shaq  They just sorta  They sorta stretch it out more  Yeah yeah  I could see that  Go to netball now  I just wanna  You know  See if Bill was into the cricket  After all  Did you do any radio  While you were there  Any press  Yeah  Wow  They're good to look at at least  Yeah so you can't dribble  Let me see Sam  Look at it 
[02:55:30]  It's got a net  With no backboard  Look at this  This is like  Nerf hoop with chicks  What the hell  There's no dribbling  And for some reason  They never try to block the shots  They don't like  Jump up  Oh this is horrible  Netball  That stinks  Like right there  Come on  Girls  Like nobody tries to block the shot  So once you have the ball  You can't move  Yeah  You have to give it away  And then I believe  There's like different quadrants  Like you can go into  Two out of the three  It's like  Yeah  It's like ultimate frisbee 
[02:56:00]  But the defense is worse  Look at that  She can't jump up  You see that little  Fucking ballet move  She did  Holy shit  Wait you're not allowed  To leave your feet  Yeah  That emasculated net  Without a backboard  Is enraging  Fucking horrible  The defense is worse  Than like an all-star game  They just stand there  And try to pop it up  And no one could  Wait why did she get that shot  I don't get it  Oh she doesn't  Because there's no way  To defend against it  No but why did she get  A free shot right under the net  These chicks are good looking  That's where she was  Yeah  That wasn't a free shot dude  There's a lot of people 
[02:56:30]  In this fucking sport too  Isn't it crazy  Look at this  Yeah but it's all chicks  If you listen  Listen to the crowd  Look now they get right up there  And look  That was an attempt at defense  Yeah that was  They got a shaky pole  And a shaky net  Yeah  I guarantee you  It's the only radio show  In America right now  Watching netball  Yes  Completely ignoring  The listeners commenting on it  Netball  It looks like that fucking  It looks like the  It just looks wrong  Without a backboard  Yeah  It looks like it has cancer  It's just  The net has cancer  No but this is like 
[02:57:00]  The cool thing  When you go on the road  And you just fucking put this  Like you go overseas  And you just put this shit on  And this is on  And you're like  What the fuck is this  Why would they defend them  When they're right under the hoop  They just let them shoot  I don't get that  I don't either  The hoop is so small  And it's so high  And they suck  I mean why make it  Why defend at all  They always get there  They always get there  I don't get it  I'm mad  Why are they defending  Their asses off  And then when someone's  Right under the basket  With the ball  They don't defend them anymore  They just throw it  Everything you're saying 
[02:57:30]  Was what I was yelling  At the TV  At like 2 in the morning  They throw it to each other  To the point where  They're right next to the basket  Watch watch  And then they just stand there  Look look  Why isn't she defending her  Because if you're in that zone  You're probably allowed  To just take a free shot  That's hilarious  This game stinks  This is terrible  They're defending their asses off  But as soon as they get under the hoop  Then they don't defend anymore  Why don't they just play horse  That's when you should be  Defending the most  Oh yeah  Watch  Defend  Defend  Defend  Defend  Defend  Look at that  Defending  Watch  Now give it to the one  Right near the basket 
[02:58:00]  They all watch  What are they doing  Because you can only be so close  You just kind of  I don't get this  This is the dumbest game ever  But they're hot  How is it not  How is it not  860  To 530  Legs for days  Because of the shaky  Fucking hoop  In the pole  That hoop is enraging  Yeah  And then they got  All the rugby down there  They had some funny names  For the teams too  One that you could never have here  There's a team in New Zealand  Called the All Blacks  No way 
[02:58:30]  Because they wear  All black uniforms  It's just like  You wouldn't  Even though we still  Have the Redskins  Sure  All right  I think the fans  That's amazing right there  I have seen  A little culture on this show now  You're getting culture  Yeah  And then you sit over there  And I saw a great  Really great debate  About whether or not  The people in Australia  Should be afraid of China  Or not  Oh really  It was really interesting  And there's one guy going like  Hey you know  I don't think you should worry about me  And then the other guy 
[02:59:00]  Was just like  No no  I think you should  I think you should  And they all  They brought up great points  About you know  The people at the top  Scaring the shit out of people  And yeah  Is it pretty much the same though  Like political bullshit  And conservative liberal thing  I hate to say it  It was more of intelligent  Like back and forth discourse  With not like  Well let me tell you something  You liberal cunt  Like everything over here  Just sounds like wrestling  Sounds like two wrestling managers 
[02:59:30]  Yelling at each other now  It's really bad  Like there's  But like  I'm not saying everything over there  Was like  They definitely had  They had  But they had their awful reality shows  They had  One show that I was just trashing  Every time I was on  That fucking  This show called  House Husbands  And it was about guys  I guess  Stay at home guys  House Husbands  House Husbands  It's House Husbands  And dude  They had this guy  Like I don't know what  His wife emasculates him  And the fucking clip ends  With him laying on the side  In the bed  He looked like  The biggest pussy ever 
[03:00:00]  And you know  Your whole version of Australians  Is that they're walking around  Headbutting each other  In the teeth  Oh fuck yeah  Of course  Crocodile Dundee  That's all I'm thinking of  Right  Tough guys  Yeah  That's a knife  Yeah  He's got a bigger knife  Oh boy  So there you go  So that's Australia  That fucking cool as shit man  Bill Burr's here  Promoting what Bill?

[03:06:00]  That they just  Right  We just as parents go  Okay  All right  Like you  You know  You want to ask questions  And stuff  They gotta ask for everything  I'm glad you brought that up  Because obviously  Polio  I'm such a  I'm in so over my head  And half the conversations  I'm talking about  Yeah but I mean  Then it's just easy to go  All right  Fucking do it  We used to have  That inoculation gun  Like  Like everybody  At a certain age  Has that mark  68 or 69  You have it on the right  And like kids  Don't have that fucking thing  We were branded  Like every fucking American 
[03:06:30]  Was branded back then  They didn't have the needles  Figured out yet  No  Now the needles they use  You can barely tell  I don't know what it did  And then there was a big  There was a big thing with women  Like where would you get it  Well if I'm gonna wear a strapless dress  Right  On the back  And blah blah blah  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  I got the flu shot recently  I didn't even notice the needle  It's like all right  They've come a long way  With that shit finally  I love to scream  Bloody murder  Last year  I got kids  You got  If you're a parent  They basically highly recommend  You get the flu shot 
[03:07:00]  That's bullshit  And I also get the flu  Really bad every year  No you don't  No you don't  I gotta realize  Who I'm talking to  Hey you know what's funny  Is you know  Yet another presidential election  Went by  And the population problem  Was never brought up  One fucking time  So here's my new conspiracy theory  You know that Bilderberg group  Where they all get together  Sure  I think that's where  They talk about  The real fucking problems  You think that's where  The real problems  Yeah  They wait till all the waiters leave 
[03:07:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  After they've brought in  Their epic fucking food  They wait till they leave  You know  I think the real  Evil is build a bear  That's okay  I don't know what that was  Build a bear  That was a bomb  That's what that was  I'm glad  I'm glad  That was worse than mine earlier  That was terrible  I knew it was gonna bomb  I'm just  Build a bear  I still don't get it  What is build a bear  He's a guy named  Oh boy  I was gonna say  He's a guy named Bill  He's really stocky  Build a bear  You don't know the 
[03:08:00]  You don't go to the mall do you  Huh  It's in every mall basically  What is in every mall  Parents take the kids there  And they build their own  Stuffed little bear  It is called build a bear  Oh yeah but dude  I'm not in that wheelhouse  I don't see it  You know that whole shit  Like you know  I deserve everything  I never saw a mattress  Commercial  Until the day  I wanted to buy a mattress  And then magically  It all went away  After I got the bear  Alright we get it  So I don't have  I don't have kids  So if I can  So that stuff  I don't see it 
[03:08:30]  Hey uh  Pat's Jets  Thursday  Yep  That's always a close one  Even though  We did so well  Dude that Andrew Luck  Is a real deal man  Even though you know  He threw a couple  Pick sixes  That guy's  It's gonna be alright  Dude you gotta hand it  To the Colts  You know  Going from Peyton Manning  To Andrew Luck  That's like the 49ers  I feel going  I know it's too early  To say this  But going from Montana  It's gonna take a couple years  To Steve Young  But like  Usually  They got a quarterback though  No but usually  Yeah  When you  That's obvious  When Dan Marino leaves 
[03:09:00]  Then it's  It's like a fucking  10-15 year  Before the next  Chosen one comes along  It's very rare  So they  They rolled the dice  I think they  You can already say  That they won  Cause someday  You know  Tom Brady's gonna retire  As much as that  Kills me to say it  And I really hope  That we don't go back  To like Scott Zolak  2.0  Or something like that  Who won the game  Who won the Patriots  Patriots won  Yeah  Yeah  59-24  Jesus  I just heard  Gronkowski broke his forearm  Ooh  Yeah 
[03:09:30]  And my buddy Verzi  Is always like  Why are they still in the game  And I guess he broke it  Like with like  Five minutes left  Oh shit  Those guys don't notice  I think half the time  They realize after the game  Oh wait  Maybe I should get this checked out  They're animals  NFL fucking players  Are just animals  Who had the shit stain  Someone tweeted me a picture  One of the guys  Just had a shit stain  And it was obviously  It was a shit stain  So now I want to know  The story  If the guy actually  Does shit in his pants  Just to make it  That more miserable  For everybody on the line  Oh imagine that  You see the picture 
[03:10:00]  Going around yesterday  It wasn't dirt  The guy shit his pants  I don't think  And I think they shit  Their pants on purpose  I don't think so  I think you got beat up  By a football player  No no man  They're animals  They shit their pants  They're mean  Me and Jimmy  Put me in lockers  They didn't let me out  Me and Jimmy  Whatever  We have a good friend  Tyson Walter  Played in the NFL  Hell he's told us  The inside shit  Did he shit his pants  Where these guys  Will not shower  Or brush your teeth  All that shit  To make it more miserable  On the line  I don't know  If it's to the point 
[03:10:30]  Where they're shitting  Their pants obviously  But yeah  They wear the same  They don't ever  Wash their uniforms  Couldn't you just do something else  Couldn't you just do something  I think at that point  You're inconveniencing yourself  If you've shit yourself  I think what probably happens  Is he got hit so hard  And combined with that  What he had for breakfast  Or dinner  He maybe shit himself a little  Inadvertently  Not on purpose  What do you think of the Jets  What do you think of the Sanchez thing man  What about it  At first  Most of us fucking hate him  At this point 
[03:11:00]  Well at first  He wasn't as good  As they were saying  Now I don't think he's as bad  As everybody's saying  So that guy  He's got skills  But he doesn't  He fucking falls apart  In pressure situations  You're not going to win  A fucking Super Bowl ever  With that  He's got the skills  I would never deny that  Also I can't believe  We're going to be  Defending the Jets  I mean like  Every key guy you've had  Has kind of gone down  Yeah I know  We've had a tough year  With injuries  Ravis gone down  And Eddie Skullhead  I don't know  I don't know the names anymore  Then it turns out  I know a lot of guys  No one wanted Tebow on the team 
[03:11:30]  So you know  They got to  They got to trade him  And get him the fuck out of New York  Woody Johnson wanted him  Because he  He's  Allegedly he's going to go to Jacksonville  Which is the Buffalo Bills  Of the South  Right  And that's just one  You know  Yeah but you know  He played his college ball down there  So it'll be good for him  That's one door away  There's no way he's on the Jets next year  No one wants him there  The owner wanted him  But obviously Rex Ryan  Did not want to deal with Tebow at all  That's very obvious now  Did you see him get tackled  The other day  Yesterday  And that guy got up 
[03:12:00]  I didn't watch it at all  He did the Gator  He did  Oh really  Yeah it was great  I didn't watch it all yesterday  I was  I don't know  They won  No I know  Because I didn't watch  That's how that works  So we got the big game Thursday  Pat's Jets  Well this is the thing  We already beat you guys  And it's always a close game  But the only thing I would say  Just because you guys have so many injuries  They're calling  I don't know  But I will tell you this  Our secondary will make anybody  We look good yesterday  But our secondary will make  Will make any quarterback 
[03:12:30]  Look like Elway  But we recently signed that kid from Tampa  He had a pick six for a touchdown  But then he also got burned a couple of times  So I'm hoping it's just rust  Well it's stupid they're making these guys play  On three days rest  Oh the Thursday night  If you don't have the NFL network  You're not missing anything with that Thursday night game  It's like the worst matchup  It's always like Jacksonville  Versus the fucking Panthers  Everybody's tired  They just played three days earlier 
[03:13:00]  That is fucked up  The punters sticking people  The guys are going down  Forces a fumble  They want  They're trying to get football every day of the week  I know it's crazy  They're almost there  You get the Saturday games  You got the Sunday  You got the Monday  You got the Thursday  How about hockey?  They think it may be taking a couple weeks off  Just letting everything settle  Right  We're in the middle of the year  I am getting  We're not seeing hockey this year  I am announcing this to the NHL  Like they really give a shit  But I am  When I get off this road run here  I'm fucking getting the NBA league pass 
[03:13:30]  I look at the Celtics  We finally got younger  We can actually run  Did you guys get younger?  I haven't paid attention to you guys  Yeah for the first time in like five years  I didn't even know that to be honest with you  Dude every year it was more elbow and knee pads  The entire fucking sleeve  Everybody looked at me wearing like pantyhose  That's when you know your team's old  Oh it's ridiculous  It used to be  Like head to fucking toe  Everybody on there had that Iverson sleeve  On both arms and their legs  The fucking Wes Unseld knee pads  And I was just like  These guys  Remember when we were growing up 
[03:14:00]  You're  Well now they just wear it for whatever  But you know  When you're a star player  Finally  Oh he's got one elbow pad  And the next year two elbows  You're right man  It's hilarious  That's it  When Shaq first hurt his toe  That was the beginning of the end  Right  That's funny  That one little injury  It just keeps leading  And leading you know  Really funny  I actually heard an interview with Kobe Bryant  They said  It was after the game  He was putting ice on  And they say  What hurts  And he goes  Everything  Oh wow  And they go  No really  What hurts  And he's like  Everything  Everything  Fucking  And you think about it  Just you know  Running around at my age 
[03:14:30]  I guess I'm 10 years older  Getting away from you  Oh yeah  How old is Kobe  34  He's getting up there now  But the amount of games  And the playoffs  He's had all those championship runs  Like that guy  It's like he's played like you know  16, 17 years of basketball  Whatever  But he's still a beast  You can get just banging into each other out there  Just fucking elbows in your ribs  Dude just running up and down  Just running back  Starting and stopping  Over and over again  Over and over and over again  Can you imagine trying to play fucking tennis  Full out  No 
[03:15:00]  I think my fucking  My shin would shoot through my leg  Yeah when they sprint  And stop on a dime  Over and over again  They should be able to do roids  And Androstein  And all of that  It's all great  Because it's just research for us  You see that synergenics  Those old guys who are shredded  That's HGH  And that's because  All these fucking athletes  That they're chastising  Like they're the ones  That use it  Right  Dude when we were younger  You took roids  And within two seconds  You punched a girl in the face  Through a wall 
[03:15:30]  And now  They got like that clear stuff  It's like  It's like smoking weed now  Where you got the vaporizer  They just sort of gradually  I'm telling you  We're all gonna be on fucking roids  They figured it out  Is HGH bad for you now  Or is it okay  I don't know  I'm not a doctor  I mean it's not as bad  I don't think  Human growth  I don't know  Yeah  A lot of  Do you see what he just did there  Yeah  That's exact  That's all my opinions  All my opinions  I get on a roll  And then there's one follow up question  And the whole thing  Just fucking goes  In the shitter  It's over  Yeah  I'm curious though  I have no idea  It used to be advertised 
[03:16:00]  On the Art Bell show  He would advertise  HGH  Human growth hormone  I'm like  What if that's dangerous  A lot of office guys  Are starting to do roids  I read an article on it  Yeah just get an edge  On the competition  Steve Carell  Get an edge  I swear to god  To sleep less  And all that  They're actually  They're actually doing that  In the office now too  It's not just for sports  I missed it  Rainn Wilson  Office joke  I just double bombed  It was good  I liked it  I liked it  Bill you got a great take on sports  I always love that 
[03:16:30]  I really do  Oh thank you  We're not playing hockey this year right  I don't give a shit  You don't right  NHL stinks dude  You know what it is  The game is great  The players are great  This is the owners  The owners are basically saying  We don't agree with what we agreed to  So basically the players  Never have an agreement then  Is that what you're saying  So basically  The only way we still agree with it  Two years later  Is if we got the better end of the deal  And if we don't  We're taking our stadiums  And going home  Wait you gotta break it down more  I don't get it  They basically  Like four or five years ago 
[03:17:00]  Whenever they had their last  Or maybe the last time  When they came out of it  They had this agreement  That you know  Your lawyers look at it  Everyone agreed  Both sides agreed  Gotcha  Both sides agreed  It's not up yet  To be renegotiated  And they made more money  Than they've ever made last year  They're on NBC again  They haven't been on network television  Since the fucking 70s  They have the winter classic  They had all this great momentum  The Olympics were great  And they just decide  That they're not making enough money  So fuck the agreement  That we agreed to 
[03:17:30]  What scumbags  The split was basically  57% to the players  And 43% of like  Some sort of ad revenue  That's when it goes beyond me  So and the players  I think negotiated down  To like 53%  And like that's not enough  For last I heard  That the owners came in  They were like you know  We get 53%  And you get 47%  Wow  Yeah  So  People should just stop going  That's the only way  Is when you teach these shitty  Whether it's the owners  Or the athletes  This time it sounds like  It's obviously the owners 
[03:18:00]  Right  Don't go  People complain about Yankee Stadium  Like yeah  Or Giant Stadium  They got that big thing  You gotta buy your own seats  You gotta pay  Don't do it  That's how I avoid  That fucking seat tax  That these pieces of shit  Put on you  I won't go  A person that doesn't go  Someone else will  But I mean  If everybody didn't go  Like I love that Yankee Stadium  Has fucking open seats  Because they're charging  1500 a game  I love that  Playoffs  Empty seats  Fucks  Amazing  How brilliant is the licensing  Fee for the seats 
[03:18:30]  They figured that out  Where you have to actually  Buy for the license  Before you even buy  Your season tickets  That's amazing to me  No I gotta tell you right now  That I actually  How the fuck did they  Get that passed to all of us  That should be  The go fuck yourself moment  Of course  You know what  I think fans need a union  But we're too stupid  And we have nothing better to do  And they know  As much as we're like  I'm never coming back  I know the second you drop the puck  I'm gonna be sitting there  With my fucking face up  Against the glass  Dun dun dun dun dun dun  Yay 
[03:19:00]  Yay  Exactly  The floor team  Yay  Yay  Yay  What a bunch of assholes  With a licensing fee  Before you even fucking  Go to a game  Or buy your tickets  You gotta purchase that now  I stopped going years ago  Fuck them  Yeah cause I remember  You used to be  Fuck them  He was a maniac  Dude he used to go around  He loves football  And baseball's Yankee fan  He used to walk around  With like the headphones on  Oh wow  And we used to trash him  Making fun of him  And he didn't give a shit  I still remember you  Getting pissed  When Knobloch got the yips 
[03:19:30]  He would actually do bits  About the Yankees  Like in depth bits  To make a reference  To fucking Knobloch  Throwing one in the stands  I loved it  I remember I worked  At Brett Butler  I opened for Brett  Years ago at Caroline's  And it was the Yankee playoff  And I was out of my mind  That weekend  And I saw her years later  In Logan Airport  And she remembers  She's like  You're still obsessed  With the Yankees  But I was so out of control  That weekend  That I  And then I just met  Enough of them  And they're just  Some of them I'm sure  Are really cool  But so many of them  Were cocksuckers 
[03:20:00]  I'm like you know what  Fuck these guys  Fuck them  Those Knobloch tosses  Were fucking hilarious  Yeah they were great  Oh my god  How is a ground ball  To fucking second  An event  You'd sit there  And go oh fuck  It's one of the worst  Things I ever watched  And then they put him  In left field  Then he was a D  The guy was out of baseball  At like 33  It's one of the worst  Terrible  Maybe you should stop  With his OCD hat touch  Before he got in  The fucking bar  Hat elbow  Shoulder shoulder  Hat elbow  Shoulder shoulder  Shoulder shoulder  That's great  You fucking  Have you satisfied 
[03:20:30]  Whatever the itch  In your brain is  Yeah but everybody  Does that  I know  They all got their  Little ritual  Oh I know  They do  But how about this  Fucking Jeter  With the hand back  Well how about  You know the fact  That Jeter is fucking  As much as he  Irritated me personally  He did  He's just  You know  Whatever he's doing  Works  Jeter said fuck you  I'm signing autographs  For these chicks  I'm taking pictures  With these girls  Little Jimmy Norton  Can go fuck  He just didn't like me  And I sense that  And I've met enough  People that I didn't like  That I pick it up  Yeah  Is that  Turn me off  That's another  Duty picture  Is that duty  Oh god 
[03:21:00]  People are sending me  Pictures of football  Players with duty  That looks like a rhino's  Asshole  Is that duty or mud  Jesus Christ  I don't know  Opie why are you  Obsessed with  Men's assholes  With shit on it  I really  You're really ruining  The game for me  Well someone sent me  That's not the picture  That was sending me  Last night  But whatever  Opie gonna get  To the bottom of it  What do you think guys  Is that shit or is that mud  I think it's shit  Gotta get to 10 o'clock  Somehow  Builder  That was actually 
[03:21:30]  Yeah  I guess our banter  Was so bad  He had to go back  To the shitty fucking football pants  You saved us today man  We're a tired show today  Oh I fucking was done  You fucking saved us  We needed some energy  So we'll tease something  I do have a big event  That's gonna involve  A lot of friends  Oh nice  And a show  Possibly here in New York City  And that I will be  Calling in  When are we gonna announce this  Soon?  Probably in like  Another week to 10 days  Great  Yeah  We're very excited about this  And there's gonna be  Like confetti coming down  And American flags 
[03:22:00]  And stuff like that  It's gonna be that  I think it's gonna be amazing  Hell yeah  It will  We'll have a marine  Sing the national anthem  We're gonna go all out  Patriotic  Nice  So we'll announce that  After Thanksgiving  Absolutely  Yeah  Can't wait to see  Who shows up  I love Jimmy  Hey did anybody  See any movies?  I saw Flight  How was it?  Denzel was great  Because he put weight on  He looked like a bloated elk  He was fucking tremendous  He's awesome  But he really is 
[03:22:30]  Just so great  But the movie  Itself  I fucking hate  Comic relief characters  It's like  He was giving  The story  Like the one on the  Opie and Anthony show  Yeah that would be the one  But like  John Goodman was in  And he wasn't necessary  And I just  There were so many things  I didn't give a shit about  Storyline wise  In the movie  It was like  What are you guys  Trying to make me think here?  What are you doing?  But as an alcoholic 
[03:23:00]  I thought he played it  Really really fucking well  And Cheadle was great  As his lawyer  But John Goodman  Who's a great actor  Wasn't needed  I don't need this  Wild guy  To come in  Whoa  What's his name?  The big bruiser?  Can you please do that again?  That's a big bruiser moment  Oh is that it?  It's the big wild guy  But Denzel played a heartbreaking drunk  And there was a lot of believable moments in it  That just  Yeah 
[03:23:30]  But you know  The end of it  I just didn't give a fuck about  Certain relations  When movies try to force certain relationships on you  They absolutely lose me  We all saw the previews  He flies the plane upside down  Do you make noises in the movie?  I'm just picturing him going  Ah  No  I make noises during the previews  When I see certain  Like when I watch  And I love Seth Rogen  I think he's one of the funniest guys in Hollywood  I love Seth Rogen  But when I saw the previews  For him and Barbra Streisand's movie  Oh god  That fucking annoying Yenta 
[03:24:00]  And I was just like  I didn't see that  Fire that up  Fire that up  What's that about?  It's called Guilt Trip  That's about 30 years behind the times comedically  Yeah  He goes really bad  I want to see this  I love a good douche chill  He goes away with his mom  It's really bad  But again  I feel bad not liking something Seth did  Because he always makes me laugh  This will be something  He'll buy a house off this one  I would like to see it  But apparently  We're having fun at home watching  Oh  Oh  You've got to ask yourself  Jesus  Who's that?  Who are you?  It's not the movie yet  She's hot 
[03:24:30]  I want to date an Asian girl  They've never done anything for me  I don't think she's Asian  Yeah she's not Asian  Oh let me just throw that in then  You want to date a white chick  That kind of looks Asian  Yep you're right  I've seen this chick before  In movies and stuff  Yeah  I don't know what her name is though  Probably some awful name  Becky Turdsbury  Becky Turdsbury  Some horribly unsexy name  Becky  When she marries you  She's not going to change her name  Hey it's Jesse Bluch  You've been married so long  Okay 
[03:25:00]  You know Andy invented a new product  And he's going to travel door to door selling it  Like Avon  Or brushes or something  No  Not even close  Are you seeing anyone?  Are you seeing anyone?  Please don't be disgusting  I thought you were seeing that girl  With the exotic name  Do we have the record scratch?  Stop  Bethany  This is actually a good cut  When I was eight years old  You haven't been on one date since then  This is you worrying about me  You don't have to because I'm fine  Do you want to come on my trip with me mom?  You want to drive cross country with me? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah  No  It's you know  We won't be gone long  It's only eight days  I can't wait  Andy I am so excited  All right  The adventure begins  Promise me you'll never pick up a hitchhiker  Promise I will never pick up a hitchhiker  Good  They rape  They're ready for your presentation  Oh fantastic  Good luck sweetheart  Thank you ma'am  Nice to meet you  Exit highway in 0.5 miles  What are you doing mom?  Please turn that off  Mom get off the freeway  Like that? 
[03:26:00]  Oh boy  You know I think I'm going to drive from now on  Good idea  Do you have any rooms available?  The music lady  It's terrible  Andy they have clip on frog earrings  Oh  Dude don't wink at me  It's my mother  You insane  Look there's a restaurant there  Does that say tapas?  I love tapas  Oh  That's not what it says mom  Please don't sit near me  When you were a baby  Your penis started to turn purple  I almost threw a pole over the table  You tell me if your penis started to turn purple 
[03:26:30]  Oh my penis could literally grow an eyeball  And I wouldn't tell you  I  If you can eat our 50 ounce steak in under an hour  You get it for free  You know how I can eat  That's your mom  I would not lie about that  Benny realizes mom is cool  We really didn't go out of plan  Yeah  Mom is cool  I always wanted to see the grand canyon  I know  How long are we supposed to look at it?  Ten minutes?  Seems disrespectful  I hate the music stops  That looks like to Rose's body 
[03:27:00]  That's a good point  He means Streisand  What a nice chapter  He's a beautiful writer  It's okay  I picked up a hitchhiker  Hi  Well I'll give you my number  And you give us a call when you're in town  You guys should probably keep in touch  Holy shit  That music stop  And then a line  And they  Do you know if somebody  It's infuriating  I would love somebody  To break into an office  And mose down 30 people  And they say  Who is it that he killed? 
[03:27:30]  Well they're a company  And they do movie trailers  Yes  And he killed all of them  That's horrendous  It's terrible  What are you supposed to do with that?  But I mean  Punchline  Punchline  Punchline  Oh mom's a dork  Mom's a dork  Mom? 
[03:28:00]  But it's Barbara Streisand  She's cool  Mom's cool  But it's Barbara Streisand  She's funny  I love it  She's actually a good actress  She was great  I like her  You know how I like Barbara Streisand  When she's fucking murdering  Leslie Nielsen in nuts  As a hooker  She was great in like nuts  She can act  But that fucking shit  Mom is good  That's just a terribly written movie  That could be  That's comedy in Hollywood  Right there  That stinks  There's a movie  Movies like that  That's exceptionally bad  No 
[03:28:30]  That's a lot just like that  The trailer represents it perfectly  And it looks like  She didn't even  You know  Travel around for the movie  Cause you know  She's a diva  So it looks like  They just set up  A lot of fucking  Set up some shots  You know what it is  They said to her  Even the Grand Canyon  They filmed from behind  I wonder if there's a shot  That proves that she was  Actually there  Cause they show their faces  They can do that anywhere  And also  If they can do that  Without doing it  The movie people  Are also gonna try  And save money  So I wouldn't  I wouldn't just blame Babs  No they said to her  Do you wanna do the locations 
[03:29:00]  And stop  She said no  With the fucking music cues  You don't like that  It stinks  It's terrible  I fucking despise  Movie trailer people  It's the pattern  I saw Wreck-It Ralph  How was that?  It was good  I liked it  I really liked it  It's a Twilight movie  Sarah Silverman is great in it  Yeah?  Yeah  It was really great  And you know what I liked  She actually did a voice  So I didn't realize it was her  Until like a third of the way in it 
[03:29:30]  It wasn't just her voice  Yeah I went to Nia like  Hey I think that's Sarah Silverman  She was like  You're a fucking idiot  Yeah it is  No but I don't like that thing now  Where like people just  Like they  Back in the day  They didn't give it to somebody famous  Because you're just gonna picture them  In the booth  And that's what I do  That's what I do  So I think you should do like  When Jay  Jay Moore did one  And you couldn't tell it was Jay  Like he did a voice  It's like alright  If you're gonna take it from a voiceover actor  Go in there  And do a voice  Yeah  Don't just fucking walk in there 
[03:30:00]  And talk how you talk  Yeah when you hear Ice Age  It's like fucking  You know  You know the people  Oh that's Dennis Leary  It takes you out of it a little bit  It's Dennis Leary's voice  He's talking  And he's saying Dennis Leary things  Yeah  I didn't see that one  Yeah that's the one  Where he's like  Sabertooth Tiger  I've created a great cartoon voice  I didn't do it on auditions  Let's hear it  Hey what time is we going here  Let's go home  I actually liked it  That is actually not too bad  Thank you  That's Tiger  Who have a stroke  I want a cartoon

[03:32:30]  On today's show  Do you even need to do that  Are there phones  That don't have the numbers  On them  I know you used to need  To do that with Blackberries  But I don't think  You need to say that anymore  Because you can't even  On the  First of all  Nobody has Blackberries anymore  And those that do  Can't you just type it out  I think you can  If you just write  WOW1-WOW  You'll be fine  The call will go through  As it's supposed to  I couldn't believe  The tweets  The pictures  That Anthony was tweeting out 
[03:33:00]  Over the weekend  I mean  He was tweeting out pictures  Of cash  And poker chips  That can be turned in  For cash  In amounts that are  Not even relatable to me  In amounts that like  If somebody was like  If you had this much money  What would you do with it  I have no idea  I mean  It's not even  I don't even see it  Happening  The amount  I don't have anything like that  And he's just saying  I was talking to him  In the bathroom  Like he's sitting there 
[03:33:30]  For 7, 8, 9 hours  I'm not going to tell you  What else we were talking about  In the bathroom  But  When we were talking about cards  For 7, 8, 9 hours  Playing cards  But walking away  With amounts that  Listen  You break it down  Hourly wage  You're doing okay  I don't know  If people even realize  It's weird too  Because the casino  Pays for him to go out there  Because he drops so much money  He's a big gambler  He's what we call  A whale 
[03:34:00]  Not like the Nagel kind  The casino kind  You know  He's a baller  Shot caller  When he goes down there  And they send a limo  And they give him a suite  And they give him booze  And they give him all this stuff  They better hope  That Anthony's coming back there  Because if not  He walked out of there  With all their cash  And their alcohol  And limos  And cars  And what not  Let's go to another Anthony  Anthony the listener  You're on

[03:35:00]  What was it  Sexing with  Bagel  Bageling with the sex  Yes  Bageling with the sex  After a triumphant run  I can't  I could never keep the title straight  After a triumphant  I know  I know  But after a triumphant run  Of bageling with the sex  One episode  In the hole  Down the drain  He's decided to take some time  For himself  He's not going to be back  For the rest of the week  You have a special guest coming in  I have a special guest coming in  Yeah it's a secret  More special than you 
[03:35:30]  Yeah  You know him  I know him  Have I met him  Yes  Oh  It's probably just somebody  From around here  No  They don't work here  It's Jimmy  He's coming back  Oh  I was just trying to test my vagaries  You didn't book that  Iraq has taken some time off for himself  Until December  Oh  2013  He's back  He's not taking all of December off  Most of it  He's not  He's coming back  He's coming back December  Then a week after that  It's January 
[03:36:00]  I don't know anything about Iraq's schedule  He's not coming back next week either  He comes  December 3rd or 4th  He's back for a week and a half  Then he's off  So he's not going to be in next week  I don't think so  No  Oh wait  What's next week  I mean it's still  Next week is still November  Then now  Oh my god  Yeah let me hear the promo  For our big Thanksgiving special  Because we talked about it on the air  As a mystery of who was hosting it  Oh December 3rd he's back  Oh my god  That's not for another week and a half  Yeah  He has a lot of vacation 
[03:36:30]  So he  Take it up  Enjoy it  They tell us to  Yeah let's hear this promo  Louis  Yeah  Ricky  Yeah exactly  George  Chris  Oh my god  Amy  That is so funny  And this guy  This Thanksgiving weekend  Loud Chip Chipperson takes you on a guided tour  What's that?  Through the worst of Opie and Anthony archives  He'll bring you nothing but legendary ONA appearances  From the biggest names in comedy  This show got me in trouble  Of course it did  A very Chipperson Thanksgiving 
[03:37:00]  What's that?  Thursday to 6am Eastern  And throughout the weekend  On the OPSH channel  Double guns motherfucker  Chip is hosting the Thanksgiving special  Fuck yeah  Oh good  Chip is here  Fuck yeah  I'm just hoping  Are you excited about this?  Fuck yeah  Now you're  Chip you're going to be hosting a lot of comedian bits  Yeah  You know  Do you get jealous  And realizing that these are guys  Who are professionals  They're funnier than you  Bullshit  They got to write all that stuff down  I just fucking improv  Everything you do is improv? 
[03:37:30]  Fuck yeah  I was listening to Voss' podcast over the weekend  And he was making fun of Son  He was making fun of Bonnie I think  For writing notes  And he sounded like Chip does now  He was like  You just get on stage and riff  Do your thing  Yeah that's worked well  Voss is an idiot  So have you done the Chip special yet?  I believe Chip has taped a lot of wraparound audio  And is Chip excited about it at least?  I believe it came out as Chip thought it would  I mean Chip thought it would come out really well 
[03:38:00]  And I believe it did  So it's good by Chip's standards?  Yes I believe that Chip felt it  By personalizing a lot of Thanksgiving things and stories  It's not that much talking  I wonder if there should have been more talking  Sal what do you think?  I heard some of it  I would have liked to hear more of Chip  Oh really?  Yeah  I like Chip  So let's put in some more Chip now  What about Valley Chip?  I love him  What's with you and the Valley characters?  I love him  Makes you laugh  I like God  Trenton likes to be so grody or something 
[03:38:30]  That's horrible  I like hot rolling  A spoon or something  Or a fork  Valley Chip is repulsive  Yeah because he's doing the impression wrong  Yeah  What's got you staying late?  Well there's a class in the gym I may want to take  Which starts at noon  But I really want to get a picture with James Spader  Who's going to be in the building  The way that you've been looking coming in here  I'm surprised you're not teaching these classes  Oh you know what it is Sam  I usually don't even do classes  Well yesterday honestly 
[03:39:00]  Was a kettlebell day  I kettlebelled like a motherfucker  Did you?  Yeah and then today I want to  But James Spader's in like 1050  So I want to get a quick picture  You go to the gym every day?  I've been going  I didn't go Thursday when I flew into Dallas  Because our flight was two hours late  And I was just exhausted  And I had like two hours till the show  So what's that when people say  That you're supposed to like  Only go to the gym every other day?  Is that just lazy people?  No no no  But you're supposed to  You're not supposed to work the same muscles every day  Like you can't do the same  Like and I break it up 
[03:39:30]  Like I'll do  One day I'll do like  All abs and back for an hour  And then I'll do  The next day I'll do like  Chest and biceps  Or I'll do kettlebells  Which kind of works everything  I don't swim as much as I should  Or I'll punch the bag  I do a lot of rounds in the heavy bag  But I fucked up my knuckle  Because I was using MMA gloves  And I ripped open my knuckle  So I had to wait like a week for it to heal  Are MMA gloves good  Or do you just use them  Because you want to feel like a fighter?  No they're fine  I just wanted to hit them  A lighter punch  I prefer boxing gloves  Because you don't hurt your hands as much 
[03:40:00]  But I find I'm much faster  With the MMA gloves  Yeah I would assume  They're my  I mean the weight of the boxing gloves  Tiny  But your knuckle's exposed  Yeah yeah yeah  So it hurt  My little delicate hands aren't used to that  Well you do  You have to figure out a way  That you can work out  And get in shape  But keep your hands silky smooth  I know I find that  I've been doing a lot of pull-ups lately  And it's really giving me  These little calluses  How many pull-ups can you do?  Not too many  I just do sets of like five or six  I can't do any  That's pretty good  I'm sure I couldn't do five or six  I can't do any impressive amount  But I do them in between  Each exercise change  Yeah  You know 
[03:40:30]  It's just good for your back and chest and stuff  I run sometimes  Except like I'll go in  Like I'll run for a while  Like a couple months  Like several times a week  And then I'll realize  I haven't ran in months  But I'll trick my  I need  My body's got to rest  And recondition itself  It's got to relax a little bit  The muscle has to grow  Like first you have to train it  And then you have to allow it  Some time to grow  No I want to do more classes  And yoga  I want to  I just  I mix it up a lot  Like  You know  Like today 
[03:41:00]  If I do this one class  Here's why  This class was like a sit-up ab class  And it was also  This  This other  Fucking cardio class  And I lasted  Out of 90 minutes  I lasted an hour  I had to tap out  But I put a fucking  A little mark on my ass cheek  Because I was doing these really fast sit-ups  And I didn't realize  Like you're holding a ball  And doing all these crunches  Yeah  And it was hard  But I was on a mat  And I chafed my ass cheek  I have an ass injury  You have like a rash 
[03:41:30]  A rash  I had like a road rash  The same thing bikers get  From falling off their bikes  I got doing sit-ups  Like an asshole  Your ass is just not used to any activity  That's not being pounded on  Wait a minute  Are you implying that there are penises  Fucking making pit-ups  Oh yes I am  No there's no penises going in there  No  No  Many a pelvic bone I thought  Had been thrust against your cock-icks  Perhaps a few  So what  What motivated you to finally like  Because you were talking about it forever  But then you also were talking about  That you would usually  Instead of going to a gym 
[03:42:00]  Have a treat  Yeah  I just had a moment of clarity  And I just stopped  That was it?  Yeah  I joined Opie's gym  Which was good  Because I love it  It's huge  There's a lot to see  That's the reason to go  To just go down and watch Opie work out  Yeah  It's easy enough to be there  But they told me  You gotta stop standing behind this guy  Going  I was just making yummy noise  I tried to catch a whiff of his sweatpants  That's a man's smell  The way he describes how often he washes those sweatpants  That's just awful  I think the club puts him on the roof  When he leaves  Roland 
[03:42:30]  You haven't been working out  Have you?  No  Have you?  Does hearing Jim talk about  Getting like  Into regularly working out  And you know  Seeing physical changes and stuff  Does that motivate you at all?  No  It doesn't?  No  So  I'm happier  Because I hate myself in the mirror  I'm fucking absolute loathing  But I see an improvement  I'm certainly not where I want to be  But I see an improvement  And there's still certain angles  I'm like yuck  But the fact that I've started to see an improvement  And people have noticed  After like a few weeks  They started to notice 
[03:43:00]  It's like okay  I've got to keep going  And when you say people  Do you mean like  Women?  Or do you just mean like  People who know you  Have been like  Oh you look like you're losing weight  Just like Bill  When I walked in today  Bill  I was like oh you're thinned out  And then like  Fucking  Keith  When Keith Robinson  Said you look skinnier  And they would  They shredded me at the cellar one night  For being skinny Jim  And still being lonely  And my clothes being baggy  So I got attacked  Even for looking better  But then I was like  Wow I'm actually  It's obviously showing  If those pieces of garbage mention it  And then the trick would be  That once it 
[03:43:30]  Like once you kind of  Because at first  It's going to show  And then it's not going to show  For a while  Right  And you have to figure out  How to maintain motivation  To stay there  That's where I'm at now  It's like I see  A tremendous improvement  But there's still  Like the gut fat  And stuff like that  I'm building muscle under it  But that stuff takes  A long time to get rid of  Because it's just been  It's for years  You've been behaving  A certain way  And Rowan  You behaved a certain way  For years  Definitely  Correct?  Decades  Decades  Okay  So you got a lot of work to do  Yeah  And you were starting  Over the summer  And then you kind of 
[03:44:00]  Is that what it was?  And then you fell off  Yeah  Because we pull closed  But isn't like  At least like getting pussy  Or whatever motivation?  It is  But we work here  So many hours  Yeah  But you don't have to be  Here as many hours as you are  You're kind of obsessive  About your job  If you took some of that energy  And spent it in the gym  Instead of being here  Like you could just  Leave early  And turn off your phone  Yeah  But then I worry though  About guests and everything  Yeah  That's true  I mean  You got to just stop  Worrying about it  And just be like  I should be  If you were as worried  About your health 
[03:44:30]  As you are about your job  You'd probably be  A lot healthier  Inside and unemployed  You wouldn't be unemployed though  Because I mean  Look around you  Like most  So many people here  Don't give a shit  About their jobs  I know  And you'd live longer  Like that sounds silly  But like Patrice  Is 41 dying of a stroke  And again  You know  I know black people  Have high blood pressure  And they're like  They're at more of a risk  For stroke too  Especially that big  But that might have been  Like had he been  Exercising regularly  And been thinner  It might not have  I mean it may have 
[03:45:00]  Happened too  Because a lot of guys  Get a jogging  I mean there's people  In perfect health  That have strokes  But it wouldn't have  Done any bad to him  Certainly  If he had the brainstem  Stroke that he had  It might have  I mean it's like  One of those things  Even under perfect conditions  Exactly the same thing  May have happened  No but I mean  It wouldn't have  Made his chances greater  Oh yeah  No bad would have come  Right yeah  By exercising or whatever  Or by just eating healthier  Yeah  Like after I work out  There's food there  So I either eat  Like some tilapia  Or some steamed vegetable  Because I'm always hungry  After I fucking work out  So I eat something healthy  Right there 
[03:45:30]  I just got sick  I eat a banana  Right before I work out  I don't know if that's bad or not  It's potassium  It sounds like it's good  It's filling  You get some nutrients  Out of it  Yeah  I always kid myself  Into thinking that  Anything that's natural  Is just good for you  Like I drink fruit juices  All the time  But they're all sugar  Sugar  If you actually make  A fruit juice  Out of like oranges  That's probably  A little bit better for you  No I get those  Naked juices  That they sell  Yeah I never drink those  But I mean  The reason they taste good  Because you're like  Oh this actually tastes good  Is because of all the sugar in it 
[03:46:00]  Yeah I don't  I only drink vegetable juice  Like you look at it  And every  Like even the green juice  They shove bananas  Apples and strawberries  Into them  Right  And that's because  Those are the ones  That taste good  Those are the  That's it  But it's all sugar  I shouldn't get  I get lemon in mine  I get like fucking  Beet, carrot  Beet, carrot  Sounds disgusting  Parsley  And spinach  And I have that  And I also have ginger  And lemon  Because ginger's good  For your digestion  And a lemon  Just kind of gives it some  I'm gonna get it  Without the lemon though  Do you just get that 
[03:46:30]  As like  Or do you get it  As meal supplements  No I drink it  With my meal  Oh  I eat  And then I walk home  And drink that  So what do you think  Because like I saw  Roland  After you did your show  On Saturday  You were  You were loving life  Like you were so excited  And it's like  If you did stuff like that  Like don't you  Because I don't see you  Like that very often  Around here  Like just feeling good  About something that you're doing  Oh then  Why don't you feel good here  Huh  Oh okay I'm sorry  No I just  I was at the wrong workplace  I just don't see you  Feeling good about 
[03:47:00]  About what you're doing  Don't you think  That if you were working out  You'd get a little bit of that  Like you were feeling good  When you were losing weight  Yeah  You were feeling  You had a different  Kind of confidence about you  And  I don't think the job  Stressed you as much  When you had some of that  Personal stress out of your life  It just depends  It's added stress  To different levels  But I think if you  If you eliminated  Some of your personal stress  And got yourself healthy  And then  You know  Maybe started talking to girls  With a little more confidence  If you got chicks  And you've lost some weight  You've eliminated a lot 
[03:47:30]  Of the stress in your life  I think  I don't think it's all job stress  And I don't think you need  To be here as much as you are  But you're obsessed with it  Because with  Because food's an addiction  Yeah  It's a hard one  It's a very hard one  Because you can't be abstinent  But it's like any other addiction  When you're working on it  You feel better  Like you see  It's not just  Okay the food  It's this shit around it  That's most of it  It's a mental  Or obsession  It's much different  Than just  All of a sudden  Oh I'm eating pizza  You know what I mean  It's a whole thing  It's a whole self-destructive thing  It's a whole  Gluttony thing 
[03:48:00]  And I have it for sex  Like my gluttony  For sex  Like I want more  It's like I'm not even horny  I'm guaranteed you  Rolling each when he's not hungry  Because I get fucking whores  When I'm not horny  It's like just  Psychotic escape  So what do you do  When you have a prostitute  Come over and you're not horny  The same thing he does  When he eats when he's not hungry  I go through it  And I feel sometimes  Good when I'm done  Nine times out of ten  It's not the high I was chasing  You know  It's like  You pay for good shit  Back to eating  Taking good shit  Yeah it's like  Sometimes you're like  Oh the food's there 
[03:48:30]  Might as well enjoy it  Yeah  Because that's where you're  Getting enjoyment out of  Not really  You're just like  Yeah it's there  But that's so  That's weird about you Jim  Because like I would think  At some point  You'd be like  This is just not  Like you just keep  Chasing that high  Without  Like it never comes to you  Like the high is just not  There  Or it's not worth it  Because logic does  They say logic has no power  Over an obsession  Right  Like you can out logic  Every obsession  Like you  Roland could list for you  The reasons that  Over eating is bad  Of course you're smart as anybody  You know that this bad 
[03:49:00]  But when it's obsessive  It's the same thing  Logic means nothing  It's like when you guys  Were trying to tell me  To throw out all my wrestling shit  And like throw out the tapes  That I had that I never watched  And all that stuff  But it's never gonna happen  Or just transfer them to DVD  And save room  Yeah  Like you don't even have to  Get rid of them  But just you know  Transfer them  And save the room  Do you  So  Do you think  You're just not gonna  Get  I'll get back on the wagon  You think so  Yeah  But before the pool opens  Like before the summer  Yeah  It's like during the holidays 
[03:49:30]  Because I spend by myself  So that's why  I shift back  And not eat as much  You spend the holidays  By yourself  Yeah  Why don't you spend it  With some friends  Yeah  What are you doing  For Thanksgiving  I'm watching football  You're not eating  With anybody  No  You should though  Eat with some friends  Why don't you come  To the Roberts household  Alright  Maybe yeah  You're invited  Usually I just sit  At the back  Every Thanksgiving  I just stay home  And watch football  It's cause your family's  In Arizona  Arizona yeah  Yeah but that's isolating  Like Thanksgiving  You don't have to  It doesn't have to be  A big family thing  But you should be  With some friends  And hang out 
[03:50:00]  Eat some turkey  And yap  Cause everybody  Watches football  Nagel didn't invite you over  No but I'm sure  Or maybe he just didn't know  Yeah yeah no  I mean he always  He always has  An open door thing  Yeah yeah  It's lonely Roland  You don't want to be lonely  I don't know  You could have the Jets  Yeah no but there is  Something  They don't play on Thanksgiving  Yeah  Oh this year they are  Jets and Pats  Patriots  I guess the Lions  Don't play  Who's Dallas playing  Do you know  I don't know  Me neither  They almost sucked  They almost sucked yesterday  Well they did 
[03:50:30]  But they won  There is something  It becomes very easy  To like start to feel  Sorry for yourself  Though when you're  By yourself  On Thanksgiving  You know what I mean  And then you know  That goes into  Unhealthy habits  Well I'm used to  When I was  My old job  We worked every holiday  So it's kind of like  Yeah  Yeah and I think  That's  I don't have that  Same emotion  For the holidays  Cause I used to work  Every holiday  Since I was 19  Yeah but you know  It's one thing  If you're at work  But then if you're  Sitting at home  By yourself  And you know  Everybody else  Is hanging out  With family or friends  Like you know  That's happening 
[03:51:00]  Sharing community  Yeah  And enjoying themselves  Passing the potatoes  Yes could you pass  The O'Grottens  Oh sure  The what  O'Grottens  O'Grottens potatoes  Oh oh I don't know  That's cheese  I don't even like them  So what do you eat  On Thanksgiving  Italian food  You just get Italian  Yeah  You order it  Yeah  Do you cook it  Or do you have a minute  I know this  This family though  In Brooklyn  They make the best Italian  So I just go there  Grab my food  And football 
[03:51:30]  You should come over  To somebody's house  My house  Eric's house  Somebody's house  Have some turkey  Have some  The fixings  Stuffing  Relax and chat  With your friends  Yeah  Do you like your show  Yeah  You like the food court  You like doing it  Yeah it's weird  Cause I'm not used to  Doing a show  Cause everybody  Like you guys all  Went through radio  And college and that  No we didn't  Yeah  One semester  I gotta be in three F's  Yeah no but like Eric though  Like he's been his life  Like on the air 
[03:52:00]  Student of the game  Yeah and I just like  And he's terrible  That's the beauty of Eric  Yeah  He never learned a thing  Yeah  After all these years  So I didn't know  What the radio thing  So I don't know  To like remind people  Like what show  They're listening to  Well that's the beauty  Of working on  For the Opie and Anthony show  And being on the Opie and Anthony show  And everything  Is that like you figure out  That you throw everything  Out the window  Like we make fun of everybody  Who knows how to do radio  Yeah  Like the only way to do radio  Is just to start talking  And then if you're  If people are interested 
[03:52:30]  In what you have to say  They'll listen  And if not  They'll destroy you  And eventually stop  Yeah I know  I was into  People wanted to know  Like actual food questions  When they called in  Did that get you excited?  Yeah  When people started going  With what you were talking about?  Yeah cause I know  All the food questions  So that's how  The Cuban for backup  Because he's more the technical  How come you didn't talk to the Cuban  About Guy Fieri at all?  Did he not want to talk about it?  No  No I think  Cause it just  Cause the Cuban's  The guy who came in  With Guy Fieri  To cook food that time  When he was in the studio  Yeah I think cause of the 
[03:53:00]  When you had the food network  I just wanted to respect  Cause those two people  Are pretty  Powerful  Roland wanted to be respectful  Hang on  This is  This is Roland  Oh yeah  This is a very  This is almost  In hushed tones  Yeah  This is  This is Roland  Making sure all the  Food network people  Feel comfortable  You know  Or the 500 pound  Chick that tells you  Like  Um  Gluten free  No you're not  No  Come on  Girl  Don't be silly  You sound like  Darth Vader  I can hear you  Breathing from the kitchen 
[03:53:30]  You fact hunt  Die  That was your  More respectful  Reserved tone  You would have  Said that to  Light FM  And see if he could  Get a shift  AC Rowland  Um  I don't know  Cause I was like  I was like  I wouldn't know  What to follow up with  Like hey  So Guy  Yeah it's great  Well I guess  I just would have  Thought cause he's  Like one of his  Chefs  That you would be  Like well  They were insulting  The food in the  New York Times  Review  What did you  Think of that  Cause Guy Fieri  Is in the news  Right now  I just didn't know 
[03:54:00]  If you didn't  Talk to him about it  Because he didn't  Want to  Or because you  Didn't want to  No I just didn't  Know I mean  If he goes  Yeah everything's  Fine I'd be like  Alright  I'm not an interviewer  Cause in my head  I'm still like  It's hard because  Of the book  Or because  You gotta do  With publicists  You don't listen  To the responses  No  Like you're not  Listening when  Somebody's talking  You're just like  Oh my god  Oh my god  Yeah  I hope this goes well  Why are you looking  At me  Oh yeah  Hello  How did Julia  Like it  She loved it  Yeah  Where is Julia  She's in 
[03:54:30]  The meetings  For  They have like  Some meetings  Why don't we  Bring her in  I think I saw her  Before  Yeah  Is Julia around  She's still in  The meeting  Until like  Three  No way  She's in a meeting  From 1030  Until 3pm  No joke  Where  Call  Call Boss Cross  It's literally  Where is she  Sal  We want her on the air  Sal  Call Rob Cross  He'll tell you  Leave the mic on  And put him on speaker  I swear to Jesus  You have her come on  Yeah  Tell him he's on the air  I think I saw her earlier  Yeah  What are you talking about  For XMU 
[03:55:00]  No one cares about those things  Ask Rob if  Hey Rob  You're on the air  Tell him  You're on the air  Is Julia around  No I think she's in some meetings  Okay cool  Ask  Wait wait wait  Sal  Hold on  You hung up  Sal  You said okay cool  Okay cool  We're done  Wait Sal  Why would you call him back  You don't know what you're going to talk to him about  Okay what do you want to talk to him about  What you have to say is  I know the meeting is till 3pm  Do you mind if she takes a quick break  And then you know  She'll catch up  In the 7 hours  That the meeting has left  You really want me to say that  Yes 
[03:55:30]  No I'm just kidding  It's a big joke  Do you really want me to say that  Studio  What happened  Called the wrong number  Oh Jesus Christ  I found the fucking number in there  It's four numbers  Studio  What are you doing  I'm dialing the right number  Oh thank god  Travis is running up the hallway  What if it's Rob saying studio  And pulling a joke on you Sal 
[03:56:00]  You think that for a second  He might be folding the number  Do you think that Rob is just maybe  Picking up and saying studio  Because he knows that you're a buffoon  Try it again  What's going on Travis  She's in a meeting  She's in the boardroom  Oh  I don't know if it's till 3.30  It is  They had a chance to get a break  Then go back  What are they talking about  Till 3 o'clock  It's music people  Just play the hits  God how fucking awful  She's a jock anyway  She doesn't even have anything to do  I know  Trust me she wasn't happy 
[03:56:30]  Because it's like that long  Literally  I never would have showed up for that  Till 3 o'clock in the afternoon  No  If you were a jock here  That's the meeting you would have skipped  I would have skipped all of them  But it's head by Steve Blatter  I  I am a jock here  I have a daily show  Can we call Rob from here  Yeah I guess so  I've never had a meeting about my show  I don't know what his phone number is  You should  Yeah but you're a celebrity jock  No I'm not  I'm just fucking disinterested 
[03:57:00]  No you can't just dial the extension  Oh rolling  You gotta dial the full number  Oh forget it  Roll it roll  The wheels came off  Give up  Give up  Give up buddy  He's just hitting buttons  Yeah  Buttons  And I thought Eric's show was good  But I was quite disappointed  Because I was expecting Eric to come on  And do the E-Rock show  Like I thought he was gonna just  I told him too  I texted him and said  Listen talk about the Simpsons  Talk about wrestling 
[03:57:30]  Talk about everything you get made fun of  I was like if anybody  You should be the one talking about  The Twinkie thing  That's all over the news  Talk about how much you love Twinkies  Oh did you see Jenny Hutt's  Adele thing  Yeah  Yeah we played it on the air  It wasn't that bad though  I mean  It wasn't  No cause she can sing okay  And like she put some effort into it  So it was like  It looked like a music video  My asshole's twitching non-stop  All the like  All the moms that listen to Jenny Hutt though  They'll all get a kick out of that  Yeah  They'll be like  Oh look at her  She's singing the Twinkie song 
[03:58:00]  Watch this  We all have bad sense of humor  It's like her  What did you say  We all have bad sense of humor  Like her  I was saying that the moms  Are basically gonna enjoy Jenny  Cause they suck  Oh okay  That's right  No but I was expecting the Eric show  And like he was just gonna embrace  Everything he gets made fun of for  Because there's so many callers  And listeners  That like the things that Eric likes  I thought you were talking about Legos  Like how  Right  Talk about Legos  Talk about all that bullshit  But he literally spent 
[03:58:30]  48 of his 52 minutes  Talking about radio  With Big O and Dukes  And then the last three minutes  Was about video games  There's a reason for that  He's an idiot  But as I was listening  He could do a show  I think  I mean I wish that he hadn't done that show  At that time  Because we were all expecting  Bageling with the sex  That was the show that was advertised  That's what everybody was waiting for  But he could do a show  Where he's talking to radio guys  I just think he needs to figure out 
[03:59:00]  What he's gonna do  Isn't that Opie's show?  I mean Opie said that was his idea  But he mentioned it like  A year ago once  And didn't do anything  Eric took a low note  Eric's the one who  And he's bringing current radio guys  There  Opie just wants to talk to Ron  And Brother Weez  And stuff like that  Which is a whole different deal  That's like Legends of Radio Roundtable  As opposed to Eric  Who's just bringing in his favorite  Radio jocks from around the country  And fanboying out  Asking him to help him fill time  It's amazing though  Because Eric really does  Because he is such a fanboy for radio 
[03:59:30]  That to him  All these local jocks are celebrities  And he doesn't even realize  That like he's on a national platform  Yeah  He's a dunce  You're just fed up with him  I'm fed up with him  I mean  Can we talk about the  Chicago trip  Where we did the Ferris Bueller's  A lot of people love Ferris Bueller  Because Eric's an expert at that  He knows every spot  So you're saying Eric could do a show  About Ferris Bueller?  No, no, no  I mean part of it  I don't know if that would be Eric's show  That's why I'm that producer 
[04:00:00]  Yeah  You book guests for him  And we'll worry about the ideas  Sam, I prepped Eric's show  I gave him a ton of like  Tech articles  Video game stuff  Stuff like that he would find interesting  I get, yeah, that's true  Eric did pick Sal  As his executive producer  For  I mean  That is the biggest mystery of all  No, it's not  Here's why  Because Eric's a groveling worm  And when he knows somebody doesn't like him  He's desperate for them to like him  Do you think that's what it was, Sal?  Um  No, I don't think it was that  I think it was just that  He could tell me whatever  And it wouldn't be like an issue 
[04:00:30]  You know  Like he could just  You know  State whatever he wanted to say  And I wouldn't take it personally  And I would just do it for him  You know  So he just wanted an errand boy  Yeah  He just wanted me to  You know  How'd you feel about Eric's show?  It was  Not good  You didn't like it at all  My favorite part when  Was when  Eastside Dave and Pepper showed up  Well they came and took over the whole show  Yeah  It was funny  You didn't like Eric's show at all  It was  It was just  I think it was too  Too niche  You know  It was very  It was very niche 
[04:01:00]  Yeah  I listened to my producers  Troy and Sam  That's true  Roland did listen to us a lot  But you know  I knew nothing  You did really well  Like  Roland  If you listen to the show back  Are those shows going to be on demand?  Does anybody know?  Sal?  I have no idea  I don't know  If the guys want it  Rob will do what he said  Yeah let's put them on demand  What do you mean  Jim you're one of the guys  You want it?  Why wouldn't we put it on demand?  Sure  Yeah  I mean there's no reason not to  Let's throw it on demand  So when are we going to have them on demand? 
[04:01:30]  Sal?  Um  Call Rob  Call him  Find out when we're going to have those shows on demand  Studio  Oh wrong number I guess  If it says studio  Say we're off the air  We need an emergency  Studio  Okay  Rob  It's Rob  I think he's just doing it on purpose now  He was doing it on purpose before  Yeah but why  If we need him on the air  Why isn't he talking on the air?  What's he doing?  Just find out when the shows are going to be on demand 
[04:02:00]  Hey Rob  Can we get the  Roland's food court  And Bailin with the sex  On demand?  Yeah we can do that  When would that be?  He hung up  Because you said oh okay  So when he says something  I'm just supposed to just wait  No you're supposed to give the follow up question  Why does Rob just hang up?  Didn't he do radio?  What does he think?  It's a one call?  Call him back  And ask him about Julia too  Yeah we wanted to talk to Julia  Hey Rob  You're on air  Please don't hang up on me right away 
[04:02:30]  Okay  When?  When is the question Sal?  When will the on demand be able to be on demand?  Sal has zero thought processing  On demand  Probably today  Probably today  And why can't Julia leave the meeting?  By what time I don't know  Okay  And Roland wants to know  When or why can't Julia leave the meeting?  Yeah they want to know  It's Blatter's meeting I don't really know  He doesn't really know  Fair enough  Okay thank you Rob  You can hang up  Wait wait wait  It's Blatter's meeting he said  Right  You don't have any real thought processing ability huh Sal?  What do you mean?  Well we're in here discussing like 
[04:03:00]  Oh when is it going to be up?  When is it going to be up?  And you have no idea what the follow up question might be for Rob  Yeah you really are like a goldfish back there  But you could find the information for us  Alright cool  You're going to complain about a phone call  That's right  Yeah  I'm sorry Sam  I will find this info out  And get it to you  Do you think Sam rides  Does Sam ride you hard?  Yes he does  I ride everybody hard  I expect greatness out of people  I ride Iraq hard  I ride Roland hard  I'm marking all of this  I guess so 
[04:03:30]  That'd be funny  But I was just on  Who else do you ride?  I get it now Sal  I was riding Roland hard  He was  And fucking him in the ass  I liked it  You like that one Chuck?  I get it  No but I was just on Roland's ass for working out more  Like it's not like I pick on you Sal  But you are the one who present flaws to me  That I feel like should be corrected  Okay that's great  That's fine  The same way Mr. Grady corrected his daughters at the Overlook Hotel 
[04:04:00]  That's exactly right  With a fucking axe  They needed to be corrected  Yes  Why?  Do you think I'm too hard on Sal?  No  No I just noticed it  I don't care  I don't give you a hit  Fuck if you brick them  Yeah  Your business  You have to go get your picture?  In a minute yeah  Is he here yet?  I text to see if he's here  What's he promoting?  James Spader  The office?  Lincoln  Is he in the office anymore?  Was he ever in the office?  Yes  I think he's last season  Not this season  I don't watch the British  He was the main guy for a while  Was he?  Yeah that was last season  Oh I didn't know that 
[04:04:30]  Oh yeah  But then  Watchin' My Nuts  Watchin' My Nuts  What's the guy  Not that you should be isolating  What were you saying?  Ed Helms?  Yes  Now he's the guy  So Spader's out  That show is just petering out isn't it?  It petered out to me  After the fucking  After the Christmas special  On the British one  It went away  You never gave the American one a chance  I didn't like it  Well how much did you watch of it?  One or two episodes  And that was it  Yeah  It just didn't do it for me  But again 
[04:05:00]  A lot of people love it  And maybe I'm just judging it  Because I saw the other one first  You know  When you see something first  It's kind of hard to enjoy  I guess so  But the American  I mean they should be  Had that expectation in mind  Since the British one was out first  Yeah  Like  What were you supposed to see them in?  Yeah and it's hard to see  You know  There's so many episodes  It's hard  When you have to do that many episodes  A season  The British office did 6-6  Two hour special fucking rap  Yeah but I mean  It's some American  Well syndication though  That's where all the money  Yeah exactly  When Gervais first came here 
[04:05:30]  He goes  I hope it makes it to syndication  That's the new thing  Like when Vivica Fox was in here  She was saying that  And they did the same thing  With Charlie Sheen's show  That's on FX now  They do one season  And then if it's successful  They film like  Literally 90 episodes  Or 100 episodes  All back to back  Like in one shot  They'll spend like a year  And they'll film 100 episodes  And then be done  They'll film enough episodes  If season 1's a hit  Or the first half of season 1's a hit  They in one shot  Film enough episodes for syndication 
[04:06:00]  And then just leave it alone  And that's it  But Community's coming back next year  Finally  I'm happy  Community is?  But isn't it coming back to Fridays?  I don't know yet  Because some shows  And NBC are shaky  I don't think Community  Yeah they're trying to get Community off the air  I don't know what it is  But that channel is trying to get Community off the air  Did you hear of Whitney?  I've never seen it  It's really not that bad  You like it?  It's not bad  I mean  It's a sitcom  It's not breaking the mold  But it's not  As far as network sitcoms go 
[04:06:30]  It's fine  It's breaking my TV  You really hate it?  Yes  I have not watched one minute of it  You  Roland has a vendetta against Whitney Cummings though  I think Roland's vendetta is  Because she wouldn't come on Opie and Anthony  Is that it?  I don't know  Well it goes back to Vegas too  What's Vegas?  I booked her on the TBS  When they used to do  Remember when TBS used to do  Vegas used to do like a comedy  Like a New York comedy week  Vegas had a New York comedy week  Like a Vegas comedy week  For TBS  Oh they had like specials?  Like Seinfeld did stand up 
[04:07:00]  Dane Cook  Chris Rock  And TBS aired it?  No  They sponsored it  It was just a comedy festival  Yeah  Big DeGeneres  Jim Norton  And you did it?  Yeah  And you were booking it Roland?  Yeah  Did you book Jim?  No  No  That would have been weird  But Whitney wouldn't do it?  No she did  Oh so what was the problem?  Then she forgets who you are  Oh  So you were friends at one point  Now she doesn't return your calls  I don't care  I see  I like Whitney  Like you know  She's funny 
[04:07:30]  I put you know  She was on Down and Dirty  She was one of the comics on the HBO show  And I had done Leno with her  And she indicated like that she would love to do the Opie and Anthony show  I was like yeah I would love to and we emailed  And then she just kind of never followed up  Yeah  And I think she was worried about Howard's people getting mad at her  It's weird  That's the same thing Lisa Lampanelli said  That she loves Opie and Anthony  But she's worried about Howard's people getting mad  Yeah  I don't know if Howard's people actually say something to them  I don't think they do  I think it's just sort of like they're worried about rocking the boat  Like they think they have a good thing when they're regulars on Howard  That's why you gotta love Colin  Because he doesn't care 
[04:08:00]  And Brewer too  Brewer's the same way  He doesn't care  I mean um  So I have nothing against her for it  Like the last time I saw it we'd sit alone  I would never try to hurt the show  Because I haven't seen it  But I wouldn't help it either  I would just let it do what it does  Yeah  And it's got  What's it  Second season now  It's successful  It's on  You know she made it through the first season  She's on season two  That's a great sign  Yeah but I like her other show though  Two Broke Girls  Two Broke Girls  She just writes that one  We gotta go  Ron and Fez  Are coming up next  You go get your James Spader picture  And we'll be back with more of this
