<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the gang rape of Lara Logan in Egypt, criticizing the media's celebratory coverage and debating the risks of Logan's assignment.  This transitioned into a discussion about Greg Hughes’ niece's subway trip to Coney Island, sparking a debate on naivete and the perceived dangers of various NYC neighborhoods, particularly the Coney Island subway line.  Listener calls fueled this discussion, with one caller engaging in a heated exchange with the hosts.  Tangents included jokes about Michael Bloomberg’s sexuality, the hosts’ invented phrase “instant feedback,”  90s music,  and a caller's suggestion of chastity belts to prevent future attacks on female reporters.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming interviews with Vinnie Paul from Pantera and Chris Jericho. The show concluded its first major segment by announcing a live broadcast from Coney Island later that evening.  Throughout, the hosts used highly offensive language.

The second segment began with a seemingly random anecdote about Coney Island in February, before returning to the Lara Logan assault, again using highly offensive language. Artie Lange called in, engaging in a hostile exchange with the hosts.  Further listener calls, from Scott and Kevin,  led to crude jokes and offensive generalizations about different ethnic groups and the safety (or lack thereof) of various NYC neighborhoods and subway lines.  A Dr. Dre song played, leading to a comparison of 90s hip-hop to contemporary "white boy music."  The upcoming appearance of Chris Jericho was announced, prompting a lengthy recounting of a previous contentious interview where Jericho appeared in character as "Moon Goose McQueen," including playing audio clips and using crude and offensive language. The discussion included extensive details about professional wrestling, including The Rock's return to the WWE (with audio clips played),  and offensive jokes and commentary.  Finally,  the segment concluded with a discussion of Charlie Sheen’s behavior, substance abuse, and lifestyle, peppered with derogatory language and offensive comments, along with the hosts’ own experiences with addiction. Speculation about blurred faces in photos related to the Logan assault also took place.

The third segment featured Chris Jericho as a guest, promoting his book, "Undisputed."  They initially revisited the media's oblivious jubilance surrounding disturbing events before shifting to Jericho's career, including anecdotes about his time in the WWE, his relationship with Vince McMahon, his band Fozzy (including details of his frustrating first appearance on the show in character), a beard-growing contest with Zach Wylde,  a drunken incident with Adrian Smith of Iron Maiden, and an incident on a plane where he urinated in an intoxicated passenger's briefcase. The conversation also touched upon the deaths of wrestlers Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero,  Jericho's experiences with improv comedy, and interactions with other celebrities.  The interview concluded with details about his book signings.  A brief technical issue with the online stream was also addressed.

The final segment focused on IBM's Watson computer and its Jeopardy! victory.  The hosts and a caller, Kyle (a Watson expert), debated the machine’s intelligence, its functionality, and its potential applications.  Audio clips of Watson’s performance were played, along with jokes about Alex Trebek.  The conversation then veered into commentary on political talk show hosts like Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, and Keith Olbermann, using vulgar language and derogatory terms.  Listener calls followed, including lengthy discussions about Billy Ray Cyrus and his daughter Miley Cyrus, a former show contributor nicknamed "Turd," and the hosts’ own radio personas.  The hosts continued using highly offensive and vulgar language throughout.   The show also incorporated several prank calls (including ones involving a bucket stuck on a head, a butt plug, baby clothes, and a "man cow"), and played clips of news reporters exhibiting unusual on-air behavior, speculating on potential causes.  The hosts also recalled past prank calls and featured a segment of an on-air argument between two news anchors.  A comedian, Jimmy, mentioned his upcoming tour dates.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used highly offensive and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  When you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Ah, good morning.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hello.  What do you mean?  There.  Bye.  There we go. 
[00:01:30]  All set.  And we're ready to broadcast.  There you go.  Hi, everyone.  Hi, Jimmy.  It's hump day already?  Is it really?  Hump day?  I like to call it Whippin' Mow Wednesday.  That old gag.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Still a pleasure to see those wow stickers.  Yeah.  Are they still sending them out?  I don't know.  So they're printing them up like...  Oh, we are?  That's good to know.  Oh, really?  Like money over here.  Do we get mail?  Oh, yeah.  We get mail.  I mean, not a lot. 
[00:02:00]  Not really.  Not a lot of wow stickers.  We never say it, do we?  We never really announce it.  We have a promo run.  Yeah, there's a wow sticker promo run.  Yeah.  If you want a wow sticker, just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Opie and Anthony.  Wow stickers.  1221 6th Avenue, New York, New York.  100-20-36th floor.  Wow.  Very good.  I am.  Very, very good.  From Mamory.  Very good.  Mickey Rooney's stepson accused of abusing actor by withholding food and medicine.  I just read that.  I didn't see that in my...  I didn't either. 
[00:02:30]  In my prepping for today show.  That's a new one.  I mean, that's kind of funny to think about.  What a fucking asshole the stepson is, huh?  What was he doing?  I don't know.  We'll have to get to that story a little later.  It's not the top story.  He kicked me in the guts.  That top story is that Lara Logan or whatever her name is.  What the fuck?  Is that her name?  Lara Logan?  From the reporter from CBS?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, you know, you get your savage animals.  Looks like she was gang-banged right there in the square.  They say a...  Sustained.  Sustained, brutal sexual attack by a gang of Egyptian men.  That's not a fondling, boys and girls.  That doesn't sound like a titty flopped out and someone grabbed it and pinched a nipple  and they ran off.  I like the post cover.  Animals.  Good.  Animals.  There you go.  They were animals.  They got a picture of her right before it happened and you could see in that picture 
[00:03:30]  a lot.  You could see that she's like, oh, fuck.  This is not good.  She's surrounded by filth that's just ready to do sexual harm to her.  Right.  And she looks like, uh-oh, I may be in the jam up here.  Surrounded by a dangerous element.  Yeah.  Wasn't that whole square kind of dangerous at that point?  Well, when you get people like CBS and, you know, MSNBC and mainstream media is what  I'm kind of getting at there. 
[00:04:00]  Not Fox?  No, no, Fox too.  They're looking for ratings and stuff, but, you know, but for different reasons.  Because, like, you get that?  CBS is under the impression they could just fucking send some blonde bombshell in the  middle of savages and everything's going to be fine because it's a wonderful revolution  for freedom.  And no, it's just dangerous.  That's that thinking.  Yeah.  Being dishonest about what you know that mentality is. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  It's like Anderson Cooper was getting punched.  Yep.  What do you think's going to happen to her?  You dummies.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Put a woman in that situation and she got split up from her crew, which means she didn't  have great security with her or they would have stuck with her.  They would have been able to have it with her.  They had a whole crew.  A whole crew.  They had security.  Yeah, a crew.  Wow.  That must have been really great because she wound up alone, broken off from the security.  Why weren't they around her? 
[00:05:00]  Why weren't they treating her like a Secret Service would a fucking president or something  like that?  There were a lot of dummies in that square.  A lot of dummies.  Security was probably, you know, the cameraman and the sound guy.  Yeah, that's your security.  That's pretty much how it works in New York.  If you try to do anything with these little reporters that are out in the street, it's  the burly camera guy that secretly wants to have sex with the reporter.  Camera guy chases you.  He chases you down and hits you a few times.  But it is dishonest thinking that, you know, this whole jubilant crowd that's waving flags 
[00:05:30]  and celebrating Mubarak's departure is all good.  They're all good people.  These are the young men that wanted change.  And no, you know what?  It's freedom to be as thuggish and animalistic as people abuse their freedoms here.  That's it.  Welcome.  Welcome to the wonderful world of the freedom to be a fucking piece of shit without getting 
[00:06:00]  your hands or your dick cut off by a dictator.  Some people just need dictators, by the way.  Why as a woman would you go there when that whole culture, not that Americans are amazing  to women, but they're horrendous to women.  Yeah.  Fuck that whole country.  Why would you go there?  They're not looking at her with respect.  They're looking at her to fucking abuse her.  Men would have gotten beaten.  I mean, it's not like men would have gotten away with it.  Men were being beaten.  Yeah.  Well, you know, just about every news organization was having someone getting, you know, harassed, 
[00:06:30]  rocks thrown at them, punched in the face.  But you got to remember, too, she was probably the first one to raise her hand and say, I want  to go, man.  She wasn't forced to fucking go.  She couldn't wait to get over there.  Yeah.  All those reporters can't wait to go over there because that's their big shot to fame and fortune,  you know?  Or you'd think one person would have sense enough to go, you know what?  And no.  Even, she was embedded with troops and stuff, and even that's different.  I mean, even that is fucking different. 
[00:07:00]  What the fuck is that?  I'm trying to move this and it keeps hitting the fucking dumbbell.  If you, imagine the boss.  Imagine.  That was a good one.  Can you imagine if one of her bosses would have said, you know what?  We don't want to send a woman into that situation.  Oh, no, you can't say that.  You can't do that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, yeah, we think it's probably in your best interest not to go, oh, bye, because  I'm a woman.  I don't know.  There's a bunch of things going on here that just reek of dishonesty. 
[00:07:30]  Are you surprised?  Anybody really surprised that this happened?  I'm not.  No, not at all.  It's sickening, though.  Of course not.  The reason I'm not surprised is because it started happening before, you know, Mubarak stepped  down.  Yeah.  They were starting to have problems and the reporters were doing their thing from the rooftops  and they were kind of like way, way more protected.  But then they thought, ah, now that Mubarak stepped down, we could be right back in the  middle of the action.  I'll tell you what.  Mardi Gras looks like a real party from the balcony.  And then they get down there on the street and thugs are just belting people in the face 
[00:08:00]  as they walk by.  And by people, I mean white people.  They were yelling Jew, Jew, as she covered the fall of the president.  Oh, really?  They were yelling Jew, Jew.  Why would you go there and deal with that fucking mentality?  Yelling Jew, Jew?  It's amazing.  Any dumb American that thinks you're going to be welcomed over there, they fucking hate  us.  Yeah, stop with this wonderfulness, thinking that they're all wonderful.  It's a mentality of Islam. 
[00:08:30]  It's a mentality of people that have been under a dictatorship for many years.  And you can't just one day have the dictator a dictator.  What the fuck is that?  Danny put up a potato shaved like a penis and said, look, a dictator.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, it looks like you need to put that with some morning breakfast.  God, thank God that's not real.  I know, that's fucking nasty looking.  Thick, though.  That's hilarious.  How do people find that? 
[00:09:00]  I think I just Googled penis-shaped potato.  Yes, dictator.  Dictator.  Too good, man.  It's just people think that in one fucking second, from one second to another, everybody's  crazy and fucking under a dictatorship.  And then he leaves, and now everybody's like, yay, freedom.  Yay.  No.  It's like, hey, we're still an unruly mob, and now the teacher's out of the room. 
[00:09:30]  So let's fucking be animals.  Well, what about all the other reporters that were down there and nothing happened to them?  Yeah, who knows?  You know, she's just the unlucky one.  Maybe there weren't a lot of buxom blondes in the middle of a sea of savages.  A group of women and 20 Egyptian soldiers saved her.  Yeah.  But she was being beaten and sexually assaulted.  Yeah.  The place is a fucking shithole.  It's another shithole.  Why would you think any different? 
[00:10:00]  We've read over the years what Egypt has done to its people as far as, you know, these,  if a woman's raped, they beat the shit out of her.  I mean, it's all this Muslim honor killing bullshit.  It's just, it's fucking, it's despicable.  It's Stone Age mentality.  You can't put a blonde, white woman in the middle of that crowd and think something bad  isn't going to happen to her.  It's silly.  She's not even Jewish and soldiers have been accusing her of being an Israeli spy. 
[00:10:30]  Well, there you go.  Why, why are you fucking standing there with these people who think like 15th century mentality?  She was,  Stupid, arrogant Americans.  She was Israeli.  She wouldn't be down there.  Exactly.  At least they have sense.  They know.  Or she'd be armed to the teeth with an Uzi and military training.  She was attacked for between 20 and 30 minutes.  Serious injuries.  Where was her fucking security as she's being attacked for a half hour? 
[00:11:00]  And here's the question.  CBS went public with the incident only after it became clear that the other media outlets  were onto it.  Oh, really?  This is where CBS is fucking despicable.  Uh-huh.  Why is that a private thing when it's one of your people, but you don't have that respect  for privacy for anybody?  Like, why is it when a reporter's attacked?  It's horrible.  Yeah.  But why is this, why shouldn't they, why are they private about it?  Yeah, if it was just some American woman that was not in the news and she's there and she  gets assaulted, they'd be all over that story. 
[00:11:30]  But, uh, well, they protect their own.  Yeah, they really do.  They kept it quiet.  They knew and they kept it quiet.  Yeah.  Because that's the way you cover news.  When it's to embarrass somebody who's working for you or humiliate someone working for you,  you don't cover.  The whole fucking group of reporters, I admire the bravery, but they're full of shit.  To go over there, you don't need to be standing there.  You don't need to do that.  No.  Well, it's the same with, uh, covering the hurricanes and everything else.  These reporters want to be the fucking big star. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, they want to be the star.  This is what you get.  You know, they gotta, they gotta now wake the fuck up.  You know, you see the guys that need to be in the, in the middle of, uh, the hurricanes  and whatever, whatever else is going on.  She was in the process of deciding whether to make her attack public.  Since when does the news give that option to anybody?  Fuck the, ugh.  So, that's a, that's a rough story, right?  It's terrible.  And then somebody here is saying, her family asked for it to be private. 
[00:12:30]  Jimmy is so off on this.  No.  Do you understand that other people's families ask for shit to be private?  And the press storms right in and fucking puts the story out there anyway, because it's  not their little family of reporters.  You think Charlie Sheen's family doesn't want his problems to be private?  There you go.  Now, I know there's a huge difference, but how about Tiger Woods?  You don't think he wanted his shit to be private?  You're wrong.  Shut the fuck up, sir, whoever you are.  You are wrong on this. 
[00:13:00]  I agreed with you until you said Charlie Sheen.  I think they don't, I think they don't give a fuck at this point.  No, no, no.  But there's a much bigger problem with him, too.  But he's, it's his is self, you know, did you see what the guy wrote at the end of Two  and a Half Men?  Uh-uh.  Oh, it's classic.  Can I get my papers?  This story really bothers me.  I mean, it bothers everybody, but.  Oh, yeah, it's.  Denver Pest, don't try to, Charlie Sheen was an employee of CBS also.  That's funny.  It's different, though.  It's different.  It's the news organization.  Yeah, but the point is, you know, he's an employee of CBS, right? 
[00:13:30]  They didn't respect his family's rights for him.  And again, Charlie Sheen made his own problem.  There's a big difference.  But she's a reporter and she's assaulted by a mob.  That's a news story.  When a news reporter is attacked while covering an Egyptian riot.  Yeah.  That's news.  Yeah.  And her family, as much as, all due respect, other families cannot make that request for  privacy.  Nope.  And I know, well, they usually don't release the names of sexual assault victims, but they  could have just said a journalist then, if they didn't want to release her name. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yes, one of our journalists.  Or if they don't want to get into detail, say it was assaulted.  A journalist, right.  You know, don't get off to say sexually assaulted, just assaulted, whatever.  Why shouldn't we know what these people are doing over there?  Oh, really?  Sorry.  No one is shocked.  No one is surprised.  No, no, no one's surprised on this one.  Don't, don't, why, I don't know, the way, the way the news is presented this whole thing  with Egypt and now with, you know, Libya and protests in Tehran and they think this whole 
[00:14:30]  thing is going to turn into this lovely democracy in the Middle East.  No, these people don't have the mindset for the type of freedom that we think or that  a lot of people think they're going to get and be able to live with.  Doesn't happen like that.  Does not happen overnight, that's for sure. 
[00:15:00]  When, when you're, you're in an oppressive government, when you're in an oppressive government  on top of you like that, uh, and then they, they leave, it doesn't mean you're, you're,  you're fine and these people are going to act civilized.  Doesn't happen.  Sorry.  What do you think?  Muammar Gaddafi's, uh, a little, uh, scared?  Well, they're going to go for Libya next.  They're going to get a few of these done, that's for sure. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  You know what, though?  They're not going to get Iran done anytime soon.  Yeah, Iran, Iran's like, fuck you, no press, fuck you, we're shooting and hanging fucking  protesters, and, uh, that's it.  And if you don't have that Facebook, you're not going to have a revolution.  No.  And Iran's making sure, making sure they don't have that Facebook.  They don't want no Facebook.  That's the key to revolutions.  You need the Facebook.  Yeah, that's the new revolution tool.  You need to get that.  Facebook.  Yeah, Iran, uh, knows how to put down their protesters. 
[00:16:00]  And now this Egypt thing is very complicated, because who the fuck is going to be in charge?  Well, did you see the Muslim Brotherhood is making a political party?  But they say they're not going to run a candidate, uh, in September, because they just think Egypt  should be an Islamic state.  So, you know, to have a free and open election is against what they believe in.  And they should, they think, boom, you should just pop in some fucking fairytale, ancient 
[00:16:30]  Stone Age thinking fuckwad to turn the country, uh, uh, 2,000 years backwards.  Is that how you're going to say it on Sean Hannity?  Exactly.  Fuckwad.  Exactly.  I believe, uh, March 17th.  You'll be saying fuckwad.  I think I'll be saying fuckwad.  Uh, is Ann talking about Republicans?  Ah, ha, ha, ha, I get it.  I get it.  Shut up.  You sound a little on edge today.  What's up with you? 
[00:17:00]  Ah, I was reading about Obama's tax plan and stuff and his, uh, his budget.  And, uh, do you know 85% of our budget is untouchable?  Nice.  And 15% is where they're making these cuts that are supposed to get everything in line.  But 85% are these, what we would call entitlements.  And it's not even on the board.  Not even on the board to cut.  And these are all, you know, the programs and social security and stuff, which of course 
[00:17:30]  has to be overhauled.  No one's got a good idea for it.  So then you look at Obama's plan, and the taxes that are in this fucking thing are just  ridiculous.  And for everybody, by the way, ha, ha, not just, oh, the wealthy, it's for everybody.  So enjoy.  Enjoy getting taxed up the ass for everything.  Enjoy legislating your fucking life through taxes.  That's another great thing. 
[00:18:00]  And then when the federal government does it, the states decide, oh, we could do that too.  And then they jump on board, and you get an idiot like Bloomberg doing the same thing.  Tax salt.  What year is this?  Tax rocks and salt and fucking frankincense and myrrh.  I want to myrrh tax.  Fucking man of questionable sexuality.  Shut up.  I hate him.  I can really picture him taking one deep. 
[00:18:30]  Can't you?  I can picture Bloomberg drooling with joy.  Can't you?  Yeah, with a couple of man's hands on his hips.  Where were you during the blizzard?  Where were you?  What were you doing?  Was something else being plowed when the streets weren't?  Huh?  Get it?  He was in Bermuda.  Everyone knows that.  He just doesn't want to move it.  He's got a little house in Bermuda.  Yeah, he does, does he?  I wonder if there's a house boy there.  I bet there is.  I have no idea.  I don't either.  All right.  I'm implying. 
[00:19:00]  I'm inferring.  I have no fucking idea.  Let's go to Dave in Fort Lauderdale.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave.  Hey, guys.  I love it.  You know, they're over there riding thousands of doors and stuff at each other, but they  got the Facebook and the Twitter.  You know, it's like back in the revolutionary days, we had the shot heard around the world.  Now we got the tweet heard around the world.  That's all it takes.  What was that?  Was that a quote?  Got the tweet heard around the world.  Your phone stinks, dude.  I'm sorry, dude. 
[00:19:30]  What was it?  I heard shot.  There's something about a shot.  You got to start over.  The shot heard around the world, like from the U.S. revolution.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Now they got the tweet heard around the world.  What shot in the what?  Dude, I'm chewing and I'm not even having my mouth on the microphone.  Can I hear you?  Okay.  One more time, but slower, slower, please.  During the American Revolution, the first shot fired was called...  We heard you!  Oh, God.  How many times? 
[00:20:00]  It's not that brilliant and profound.  I'm a huge fan of the needy listener.  I'm a huge fan of the needy listener.  Oh, God.  He just kept stepping in it.  How the fuck does one tweet, though, get everything done like that?  Pretty amazing.  I don't know.  Who was responsible for that first one?  That guy.  I don't even know his name.  That guy.  It's just that guy.  It was that guy.  It's like pre-World War II Germany. 
[00:20:30]  It was Hitler and his friends hanging out at some bar going, fuck this shit.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, fuck this.  Yeah, I'll have another beer.  That's probably why it didn't work.  There's definitely an element of society that's way too trusting.  Yeah, definitely.  Way too trusting and delusional.  I, um...  Hmm.  How do I say this?  Well, I got a family member who's 18.  Yes. 
[00:21:00]  Young.  Oh, boy.  Female.  Impressionable.  Impressionable.  Don't tell me.  Is this going to be something that upsets me?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  You know what I mean by upsets me.  But it proves the point of impressionable and how, you know, people just are way too trusting.  Now, she lives somewhere else that's way different than New York.  Okay?  Comes up to see me with her friend, another 18-year-old.  And I'm like the cool uncle.  I'm the cool uncle. 
[00:21:30]  So, I let him do more than probably, you know, her mom and dad will allow.  You know, that's your job as an uncle.  They don't run around the place in their panties going, Uncle Greggy, Uncle Greg, what  do we...  Jesus Christ, how fucking no.  It's fucking family.  Uncle Greg.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't seem to find my bra.  You have your boxers on?  Your cock-hugging boxers?  When you see your own soul in someone else's eyes, it just makes the fuck you. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, who looks in the eyes and is knocking her head?  Jesus Christ.  Forget it.  Go ahead.  No, no.  I want to know what she did.  So, you know, and she's just graduated high school and she wants to, like, take you to New  Arkansas, which is fine, man, you know, go do Central Park, go do the village, go to the  museums, whatever.  Take the subways, that's fine.  And she gave me her itinerary and one of them was to go to Coney Island.  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, look, don't go to Coney Island. 
[00:22:30]  That's the only thing I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah.  The only fucking thing I'm telling you is don't go to Coney Island on a subway.  I've replaced the word Coney with something else, but, you know, you can make up your own  words.  But it goes with this whole thing, sort of, and how people out there, especially younger  people, are a little too trusting.  You hear about the younger people that want to move into the ghetto and be the ones that,  you know, kind of take that whole thing on and it's not as bad.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And that's where my line is.  Dangerous minds mentality. 
[00:23:00]  That's where my line is.  So I basically begged her and her friend, don't do this.  You can do anything else.  I don't care, you know?  I think you can handle yourself, you know?  Well, so all of a sudden, it's dark and she finally comes home.  Oh, we decided to go to Coney Island anyway.  And I looked at her like, I'm a grown man who has been living in New York for how many  years now?  At least 10.  And I wouldn't take a subway to Coney Island, right?  No.  It stops in every bad neighborhood of Brooklyn to get to Coney Island.  Yeah, it's really nasty. 
[00:23:30]  It's really, really not a safe subway ride.  She's showing the Warriors.  Yeah, right?  That's where they were going, right?  It's more dangerous than that because they don't dress up so you can see them.  And they blindside punch you in the side of the head from behind.  And just to make the story a little better, you know, the day she was there, there was  a shooting, you know?  Oh, yeah.  It was pretty much off-season.  But she wanted to check out the world-famous Coney Island.  Yeah, well. 
[00:24:00]  Taking the subway, which you know is horrendous.  Yeah, it's a bad subway ride.  The subway from Manhattan to Coney Island is not good.  Yeah.  But she has that trusting element, like she can handle herself.  And I'm like, you can't handle yourself in every situation.  No.  Everyone has some sort of street smarts, but you've got to understand what level you're  at with that crap, you know?  If someone comes up behind you and just punches you in the fucking side of the face, blindsides  you like that, there's nothing you're going to do about it.  Unless you're looking out for that and you make sure your back is up against something 
[00:24:30]  so no one can creep up on you.  You've got to know those little things.  Well, I don't think she had any skills to handle herself on a subway all the way down  to Coney Island.  I mean, the story does, you know, whatever.  Nothing happened in the end, but still, it's that trusting mentality that eventually will  catch up with her if she doesn't wake the fuck up.  That'll creep up on you.  And if someone looks thuggish, they probably are on that line, on that subway line, believe  me. 
[00:25:00]  Right, right.  Don't pull the, I like people that pull the white guilt thing and think, I'm not going  to react, I'm going to, I'm just going to, because people, you can't tell on the outside  that, and then, boom, big, big fucking meat hand hits you in the face.  Right.  She thought she knew better, and I guess in a way she did, because nothing happened to  her, but, you know, the point being that eventually, that's going to catch up with  you, you know, if I'm telling you, don't go, because I'm like, I am the, I'm being  cool, like, yeah, do that, do that, that's cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then when she told me to Coney Island, I'm like, that's the only thing I don't want 
[00:25:30]  you doing.  That's an idea.  I don't want to be responsible for you going back and forth to Coney Island on the fucking  subway.  Oh, Uncle Greg.  No, no.  You're such a downer.  Yeah, right?  No, which pissed me off was the fact that she smiled, nodded, okay, okay, okay, and  then, you know, late in the night, she comes home like, yeah, I don't need this.  Look, you know, I just became a father, I'll have to deal with my own issues with my son.  I don't need to deal with your issues, you know? 
[00:26:00]  I'm not your father.  Yeah.  I asked for one fucking thing.  So where's she going today, Bed-Stuy?  Yeah, really?  She didn't come home with, like, a sideways starter hat on, did she?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She's long gone to college and back where she's from and stuff.  It was just very disappointing, but it also kind of makes that point that I think especially  younger people are way too trusting.  Way too trusting and, yeah, yeah, just naive about realities.  But this situation is different. 
[00:26:30]  I think all the networks want the beautiful people on TV and they want you right in the  middle of the action.  And then the reporters are these, they want to be rock stars themselves and they get themselves  in these crazy situations.  And finally, one got caught, man.  You know, she's embedded with the troops.  She had, you know, military guys around her that weren't going to let anything happen to  this woman.  Armed guys.  Yeah.  Americans.  You send her out into this fucking celebration, as they were calling it.  Wow, they sure celebrated. 
[00:27:00]  Well, we work for CBS.  You think they're going to hire security?  And actually, you know, that's money.  Well, that's exactly why.  That's money they could save.  So.  I read between the lines, knowing from working for that company, what it was all about.  And I'm sure, I'm sure the security was CBS employees, probably an intern.  Hey, Brent Weaver, you go fuck yourself, asshole.  You piece of shit.  Oh, boy.  Brent Weaver.  It's Opie the Hole.  You almost shushed in on the gay discussion of Bloomberg.  What the fuck?  I'm trying to protect a fucking lawsuit, asshole. 
[00:27:30]  And we've been doing that with each other for years, you cunt.  Ooh.  Does that sound like a whole fuck face?  Piece of shit?  Just be a stupid listener.  Asshole, there's a reason why we do what we do.  I don't feel like having a fucking lawsuit with stupid Bloomberg.  Bloomberg.  So when we go down that road, we protect each other.  Asshole.  Is that enough for you, dick?  Enough already. 
[00:28:00]  Ooh.  I don't give a fuck if there's a million gay jokes about the mayor.  But we've got to make sure we don't get in a fucking lawsuit, douchebag.  Like, if I stand here and say, I know for a fact Mayor Bloomberg is gay, that's a problem.  Right.  I wouldn't say that, of course.  That would be a problem.  That would be a problem.  Because you can...  We've got to be fucking careful.  So I decided to make sure we're all careful today, asshole.  Enough.  Some people should just listen.  There's no reason why you need to fucking do any type of feedback. 
[00:28:30]  Because you're not smart enough to understand.  I would never look at that.  Or Brett.  I would never look at their thoughts coming in.  Honestly, I just looked up.  I barely used the fucking instant feedback at this point.  I would never look at their thoughts.  I would have two pictures, one photo of a horse pussy and one photo of an elephant's asshole  before I would read their constant...  Right.  Twitter's bad enough.  But at least with Twitter, it's like, you know, I can put my phone on...  I could never...  You could block...  No, the instant...  I mean, the instant feedback is a very important part of the show, you know?  But unfortunately, every once in a while, you get someone that is just such a stupid dope 
[00:29:00]  that should be on a subway to Coney Island today.  Oh.  Today.  Asshole.  I can't believe we never fucking trademarked that or registered it.  What?  Instant feedback.  I hear it all the time.  Everyone uses it.  I hear it all the time now.  And without sounding like somebody who makes shit up and says, oh boy, we actually coined  the phrase.  Coined the phrase. 
[00:29:30]  We certainly did.  Came up with it on the spot back in the 90s.  Instant feedback.  Because it was a way for the audience to instantly feedback their comments and information.  And it's used all the time now.  Some therapist would claim it, though.  We say that here in group.  That if you have a thing, just give instant feedback.  Give instant feedback.  I request instant feedback.  Should have done something.  Probably technically we invented Twitter then. 
[00:30:00]  Yes, we did.  We were the first to have a lot of people responding and talking.  Yes.  About nonsense.  Right.  And now that guy goes and hides.  Fucking pussy.  Oh.  Pussy boy.  Pussy boy.  Pussy boy.  You should only address them if they call.  On the phone.  Pussy boy.  Pussy boy.  Pussy boy.  Asshole.  Twat.  Cunt.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Language.  Oh, I would love to make all those jokes, but we gotta fucking make sure.  That's all.  They should only call in. 
[00:30:30]  Fuck them when they're writing.  And even the funny lines.  Just call in.  Honestly, instant feedback's just about to go away.  It just doesn't serve.  Dude, you should hang something like, you should hang a fucking fake window there and drapes  around it and put like a little fake sunshine coming through.  There's no reason for that.  I would never do that to myself.  Even the good stuff is like, fuck them.  I'm not doing anything to myself, Jimmy.  I looked up because we have instant feedback about the show and that one just popped out today.  That's all.  No, I mean, I would.  I'm not searching out shit on this thing anymore.  No, no, no.  I mean, anything negative, positive, I would, none of it. 
[00:31:00]  Well, I'm not going to fucking let that asshole fucking not understand.  You don't understand what we do, asshole.  You're more of a fucking 90s on nine type of guy.  That is, I don't like 90s on nine.  I hate 90s on nine.  No, that's why I said it.  If I'm going to listen to 90s, I'll go lithium.  That's why I said it.  Lithium is too cool.  90s on nine plays like En Vogue.  Right.  Never going to get it, never going to get it, never going to get it. 
[00:31:30]  You just realize that there were way too many fucking genres of music that had no business  being in the 90s.  No.  No.  Copy stuff was horrendous.  The rap stuff was horrendous.  No.  Old school.  90s rap?  Old school rap, like Wu-Tang and like the first, like Dr. Dre.  Dr. Dre.  You know, I mean, that was some really good stuff.  Hearing Dr. Dre for that three seconds on the Grammys brought back a lot of memories,  man.  Thanks.  Thanks, Grammys.  Three seconds.  Right.  Yeah, that like the early stuff, that was like 90, 91. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, that stuff was like really.  Ghetto boys.  I mean, even I listen to that stuff.  N.W.A.  Old school gangster shit.  All right.  Everybody was so upset that, you know, they would talk about the po-po at 187, yo.  Oh, but it was just entertaining and funny as fuck.  And to see some of these guys now, just mainstream actors, putting, doing horrible movies like,  you know, Are We There Yet?  And shit like that.  It's just like, oh, see, see, it was a goof. 
[00:32:30]  They're just talking about fucking, you know, oh, cop killer.  Uh-oh, look out.  Look out.  This is fucking goofy dumb shit.  I have to publicly apologize for talking about music channels.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I thought to women.  No.  No, my doctor's been in touch with them.  No, my, after our show, I interviewed Vinnie Paul, and it will be airing Friday on The Boneyard.  And I was supposed to have one of the guys from Buck Cherry as well, but there was a glitch. 
[00:33:00]  So they were sent home.  Oh, no.  What's the glitch?  I don't know.  We actually don't know yet.  I honestly don't know.  What, in recording?  No.  In them being booked on the show.  So they left, and you're like, where are they?  I had Vinnie, but I was going to get Josh, who was very cool, and this guy, Keith Nelson,  I think, is a guitarist.  Right.  I had Keith, and I told Josh to come, too, but they were sent home.  So instead of three people, I just had Vinnie.  Oh, all right.  So my apologies to them, because they were booked as far as I knew.  I actually rode down in the elevator with Josh, and he was leaving. 
[00:33:30]  Does he look like Dennis Leary to you?  With tattoos?  No, he looks like...  Yeah, there was something going on there.  It was a little leary.  He looks like Eric Roberts.  The younger Eric Roberts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Eric Roberts.  When he walked in, I'm like, that guy looks like Eric Roberts.  Wow.  Also, a little bit of what we were talking about before.  What's his name from the Warriors?  The head warrior.  Oh, right, right.  Lynn something.  I don't know how his name was.  Yeah.  So why couldn't you interview them all, and then just squeeze it on some other day?  No, no, I could have done it the same day.  They were gone. 
[00:34:00]  They were told to go home.  They left the building.  Oh, they were told to go home.  Someone told them, you can go now.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, Jimmy's sitting there like, eh, what the fuck am I?  Yeah.  You shit?  I don't want them to think that I blew them off, because I certainly didn't.  Right.  No.  Not your fault.  No.  Hells no.  All right, why don't we eat some food?  Oh, yeah.  I got my soup.  I think that fucking Larry fucking story just got us all bummed out.  Oh, it's fucking awful.  I know someone's going with the joke, but why not, though?  Let Paul say it.  Paul in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead, Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, what's up, man? 
[00:34:30]  What do you say, Bill?  I say that reporter should have had a chastity belt made out of the Sinalina bread.  Fuck, you fucked it up.  You had to go with a bread joke.  Why not bring the chastity belt back for some of these reporters going on these revolution areas?  Whatever.  Iron teeth in front of the vagina.  We have better material now.  Like Kevlar?  Get something.  Comfortable chastity belts that are comfy.  Get a metal diaper on or just fucking anything. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, that would be kind of nice.  And this Russian psycho who went on a stabbing spree.  Can we just kill certain members of society?  Why are we even dealing with this guy?  How about this?  You know he did it.  Just put a gun in the back of his head and end it.  And the media is interviewing the guy and they're taking what he says seriously.  It's like he's a nut job that has no reason to walk around anymore.  Bloomberg is...  But it's not even close to a death penalty case.  Not even close.  Bloomberg's investigating where the knife came from.  If it was bought out of state and brought in here illegally. 
[00:35:30]  Get it?  This guy did a lot of damage with a car and a knife.  Jesus Christ.  Just kill him.  Speaking of stabbing Bloomberg, you know.  He's not against that.  Trust me.  I have no problem with that shit.  But you've got to fucking be smart.  Let me go to Scott in Brooklyn.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, brother?  Hey, man.  All right, man.  You guys are killing me with this shit about Coney Island. 
[00:36:00]  I know you make more money than I do.  But I live about seven minutes away.  And I travel on the three subway lines to go there.  It ain't that bad.  Hold on, sir.  Hold on, hold on.  How old are you first?  Just answer a few of my questions.  How old are you?  Forty-five.  You're forty-five.  How long have you been on the trains to Coney Island?  Twenty years.  Twenty years.  Forty-five.  Obi's talking about a fucking 18-year-old girl that is new in New York City. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe your experiences have made you a little educated in what to look for as far as thugs go.  Can I also add to the equation that he says he's seven minutes from Coney Island?  The family member came from Manhattan.  It was about an hour ride, asshole.  Another stupid dummy that has no reason to listen to this show and participate.  Be a listener!  So, what, sir?  Retort? 
[00:37:00]  It's nice over here.  The whole train ride doesn't suck.  What drug are you on?  Maybe you're one of the guys that are bad to be in the subway with.  Just tell me what drug you're on.  Yeah, what you're doing.  That you're shaking down old people to get some change for your fix.  You're drinking?  You're drinking?  Man, you guys are screwing with me.  I swear to God.  What drug are you on right now?  Yeah.  Not. 
[00:37:30]  I'm telling you.  Little heroin?  No.  It does sound like the heroin.  Well, Nathan's in January.  That's fine.  But.  What substance are you on right now?  Everything is cool, man.  I mean, the only time a cop has been on my block since I lived here is for me.  See?  Exactly.  Wait, maybe you're the guy.  You're the bad guy.  Of course the bad guys don't know they're the problem.  You don't know, but you're the problem. 
[00:38:00]  To you, you got just easy pickings out there.  Yeah.  You fucking skipped through life knowing that you could get away with shit.  A lot of nice middle class people who live out here who'd like to not have their neighborhoods besmirched.  Besmirched?  You know, I was on the subway to Coney Island once and I saw a naked guy with a briefcase.  And we had a discussion about the Mets.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jerry.  He knows the Jerry, though.  He did know the Jerry.  He knows the Jerry.  Because he. 
[00:38:30]  Come on, man.  Scott, let's be honest with each other.  What are you on right now?  A little drinking from the night before?  A little weed?  Perhaps medicine?  Maybe some medicine.  Why?  Because I live here and I was a little offended.  What?  No, you sound a little slurring.  You're slurring a bit.  You sound a little groggy.  What's going on?  What are you taking?  Maybe some prescription meds?  What are you on?  What are you on, brother?  Well, it's okay.  Charlie Sheen says it's okay.  Charlie Sheen basically says it's boring being sober. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Fess up.  What do you got?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Well, it's pretty much my demeanor.  You got a little oxy?  What do you got?  No, nothing, man.  Valium?  I just wanted to call you guys out.  I'm not ragging on my neighborhood.  All right.  It's a great neighborhood.  Yeah.  If I was drinking or smoked a little weed or something like that, I mean, what does  that got to do with it?  All right.  I'm like one of the guys that makes this place cool. 
[00:39:30]  Look, I need someone to...  That's pretty funny.  That's pretty funny.  You stopped me in my tracks.  Yeah, yeah.  I like you now, Scott.  You're all right, man.  Jesus.  Look, guys, it makes this place cool.  But he's seven minutes from Coney Island.  I need someone to tell me what the ride is from Manhattan to Coney Island.  Exactly.  In my dumb little research, I saw a lot of stops on the subway line that were a little  rough.  The F train or whatever that fucking slow-ass train that stops everywhere goes, but mostly  the F train, the D train, and the Q train, they go quick enough, and you're not 
[00:40:00]  stuck in fucking ghettos and shit like that.  I mean, it's all right over here, man.  Right.  It does.  Yeah.  Don't even give me your shit.  All right.  Trap Dog has something to say.  I take that ride every morning and every afternoon, yeah.  Oh, the way to Coney Island?  No, but I live in Sheepshead Bay.  I'm like three...  I live in...  We asked you. 
[00:40:30]  We asked you in the middle of Travis's fucking story.  Thanks.  We asked you where you're from.  So I'm like three or four stops away from Coney Island.  And it's nice.  I take it all the way into Manhattan.  It's nice.  Sure, the neighborhood I live in is nice.  The neighborhood...  Brighton Beach is nice.  Yeah.  And Coney Island, you know, I mean...  And walking around Coney Island is nice?  Yeah.  I mean, you walk around...  Look, look.  Come on, man.  Look.  You walk around...  Come on.  Let's be honest with each other.  That place is fucking scary.  Sure.  I know they're trying to...  At three in the morning, maybe, but you're walking around in the afternoon. 
[00:41:00]  It's all tourists.  Well, they got home pretty late, so...  Yeah?  You want your wife and kid taking the subway down there alone?  To Coney Island?  Yeah.  During the day?  Uh...  Dusk.  No, not at dusk.  Not at dusk, but during the day?  We'll start with dusk, and then we'll back up from there.  Well, you know, vampires are dangerous, but in the daytime,  there's no problem.  That's true.  See, that's what I'm saying.  But they're still vampires.  I'm not saying it's a great neighborhood, you know, at night.  Why did everyone brush past the fact that the day she was there, 
[00:41:30]  there was a shooting?  Yeah, there you go.  Okay?  So I wasn't that off on this whole thing.  Dude, I listened to it.  There was a shooting in Manhattan two nights ago.  What the fuck do you want?  Where was the shooting in Manhattan?  No shootings?  Well, we had the Russian guy, but...  Yeah, the Russian guy with a knife.  That was a knife thing.  Yeah, okay, fine.  I rest my case.  Well, he rests his case.  All right, you know what?  He does sound like a case.  He's more sober than he said.  He was on the fucking three-trade in Times Square. 
[00:42:00]  Yep.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We certainly...  It's not perfect, that's for sure.  But if you're going to, like, play your odds, you know...  Yeah, look, you've got a point...  Over some parts of Brooklyn, always.  That doesn't look like a nice street.  I probably, you know...  What's this?  I'm far more aware than...  It's like two blocks away from...  Yeah, I'm not going to walk around Neptune Avenue.  Who the fuck would walk around that?  Look at this road.  Get the fuck out of here.  Keep going.  Look at this.  Look at that road.  Walk down that road at night. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, right.  Warehouse district.  Yeah, that just looks scary.  That's where you live?  Oh, yeah, jump out.  No, that's not where I live.  That's Coney Island.  I want to get out and trade them fucking masks at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Now, there are plenty of nasty areas, my friend.  Yeah, we understand.  Exactly.  You guys should be a little bit...  But they didn't go there.  The story was that Opie's niece went to Coney Island.  They could have went anywhere, sir.  You can't just keep putting in bad places.  Go to Mogadishu.  See, if they had gone to, like, East New York, we would be talking about East New York right now. 
[00:43:00]  And you'd be going, I wish they'd talk about Coney Island so I could call in.  No, you guys are talking about the train like you fucking take it every day to go to work.  And that was pissing me off.  I take this...  I've taken the Coney Island train for years, sir.  Yeah, I...  Look, there's a...  Give me a fucking lying piece of shit.  That's not true.  Can't get any past him.  You're a lying piece of shit.  That's not anything past Scott. 
[00:43:30]  That's not true.  I actually deliver hockey sticks to Riff.  I fucking commute every day.  It's like, if you nodded off on the train long enough, somebody pisses on you.  Yeah, exactly.  I sleep on the subway every morning.  You do.  And here.  And here.  And here.  And people look out here.  Oh, shit.  That right there.  I have a Google Earth.  We're looking at Google Street View and...  Google Victim View.  Yeah, that's...  That's very...  That's very telling.  A couple of... 
[00:44:00]  Two little girls.  Pedestrians.  One can't be more than ten, and the other's like six.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  And they're walking out of what looks like a penitentiary.  Where the fuck are the parents?  They probably got their five dollars.  They're going to get on the bus now.  Yeah.  I'm paranoid to leave my kid alone for 30 seconds, and they're just wandering around bad parts of Brooklyn.  That's the projects right there.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Projects.  Oh, Scott, you all right?  Yeah, thank God you can all afford to live in a day, Steverhood. 
[00:44:30]  Hey, Scott.  Hey, I lived in some shitholes in my day.  Yeah, fuckface.  We were fucking really poor.  Yeah, Scott.  Don't people understand that?  You turned down a good job?  I didn't have a bank account until I was in my 30s, asshole.  Do you know one time when I was in high school, we ran out of crackers, and I had to eat my caviar off a plate?  Oh, Opie.  That's terrible, Jimmy.  Opie.  Yes, Scott.  Was your treehouse in a nice neighborhood? 
[00:45:00]  Scott's bringing me back.  I like you, Scott.  You're all right, man.  You know, you're kind of right, though.  I mean, my situation was I lived in a really, not a really nice, but an upper-middle-class neighborhood, but we were the poorest fucking family in that neighborhood.  Centiport was very nice.  Which made it very strange.  I liked Centiport.  Because we really knew what we were missing.  I think it's better to be poor in a poor neighborhood, because then you don't really know what you're missing, because everyone around you is in the same fucking boat.  Yeah.  But when you have a really shitty car, and 16-year-olds are driving Beamers to high school, it fucking starts pissing you off. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, you get a little annoyed.  And you realize that these assholes never have to work a day in their life.  It all worked out in the end, but at that time, I didn't know what the fuck I was going to do.  I get to train to work every day.  What?  Just like a bunch of radio jocks who act like they take the D train to work every day.  That's right.  Well, we used to take the train for a while there.  Well, I did.  I got thrown off because I was yelling, choo, choo, really loud the entire ride.  No, I don't understand. 
[00:46:00]  When I was a kid, which is like the 70s, when I was in my formidable years, I mean, we lived  in a neighborhood that was so middle class, maybe really nice neighborhood, but the economy  and fucking everybody up being on food stamps and shit like that turned into a ghetto.  I mean, it happens, bro.  Oh, isn't that something?  All right, Artie.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  There's on the side of, on the side of Al-Sadi. 
[00:46:30]  Wait.  I appreciate you giving a little, uh...  No, Elf.  What the hell is that?  A little comeuppance to the, you know, to over here.  Hold on, sir.  We are now looking at street view also of the lovely neighborhood.  Is this, how many, how many blocks from Coney Island that this guy's trying to say is safe  and that I'm wrong for not going to allow my, my innocent family member at 18 years old  to go to Coney Island?  I don't know.  I've just been like going down the block in street view.  Down the block.  Probably about four or five blocks, I guess. 
[00:47:00]  This is, uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Safe to say within five minutes of the stupid first wheel?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what?  Once, when we're done looking at this, I'll zoom out.  Because I don't want to exaggerate.  I don't want to exaggerate this shit.  Keep us within five minutes of the dumb first wheel.  There's three black guys standing out, uh, John, out in front of a discount deli and  grocery store, uh, and-  There's two guys and a woman, I think.  Is it?  I can't tell.  And, uh, on the side is a mural, R.I.P.  Mickey.  A big mural of Mickey and a, uh, a book and his little dog, I guess, and the date he died 
[00:47:30]  underneath them.  Can you imagine-  That's, that's great.  I see that all the time.  How long would that mural last in Huntington, Long Island, Anthony?  Oh, boy.  Paint that right up.  It would be gone the next day.  What is that little thing, that little window following you around?  That's where-  Uh, that's-  That's part of, uh, yeah, it's part of the street view thing.  So, like, let's say I want to just zoom in right on that sign, I could just go like  that and zoom right on.  That's amazing.  I know! 
[00:48:00]  Do you have to buy that?  What?  No.  Google Earth.  Well, this is just Google Street View.  It's like, this is just part of Maps.  This is all on a browser.  So, so how far was that from the, uh, the first wheel there, Danny?  Uh, it looks like we zoomed out.  Uh, around 30th and Surf.  Hang on.  This is just quick little Googler thing, too, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I never used Googler.  Oh, it's like two blocks from-  Yeah, it's two blocks.  It's two blocks from-  Two blocks.  There you go, I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.  That looked like shenanigans. 
[00:48:30]  I'm wrong.  Two very white 18-year-old girls should go to Coney Island and walk around and enjoy.  Because they didn't just go there for the first wheel.  I'm not stupid.  They like to really take in the area.  So I guarantee they were walking around some of those streets.  Hey, Opie-  They just, in this case, they just lucked out and nothing happened to them, thank God.  But I don't want to be responsible for that shit.  No.  Opie.  What?  If your family member was fucking taking a train to Coney Island in the middle of the  night, I don't know, she's a whore or something. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know what the fuck she's doing.  I mean, how the fuck would I put in the box getting off?  I couldn't be mad at the guy.  He's just such an idiot.  I didn't say the middle of the night.  You can just understand people's concerns, sir, can't you?  Yeah.  I can certainly understand.  How about how-  Impressionable, 18.  Those trains you act like, oh, look, man.  So, so well.  Scott.  All right.  All right.  Scott, Scott, listen to my question.  Listen very-  Scott, Scott. 
[00:49:30]  Why am I trying to-  Scott, Scott, let me-  Scott, focus.  Focus, Scott.  You're right.  Focus before you take the next hit.  Here's the deal.  Yeah, you're right.  Everyone has their boundaries and they're like, I guess, they know where they could kind  of walk around, right?  Where are you scared to go in the New York area?  Oh, good question.  Pretty much the same place that Anthony's scared to go.  I'm not scared to go anywhere. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, but you can't carry a gun everywhere.  Why not?  All right.  I love this guy.  It's been the five boroughs.  You wouldn't last a fucking minute in, like, most of the neighborhoods I'm thinking of.  And people shouldn't go where people are welcome.  If you're a white supremacist and black people want to move in there, it's like people, women 
[00:50:30]  want to move into a men's club.  Where's he going now?  People want to move into a white neighborhood.  So, like, they're just like, you know, any place that, any place that has any...  Sleepary wine!  That's a Chris Rock joke, sir.  And you just described what my thoughts exactly. 
[00:51:00]  In my dumb little stupid world, Coney Island or the subway to Coney Island, it could be a  bit scary for naive fucking little girls, man.  Are we done with Scott?  Scott has educated us, I think.  There's cops, like, on every corner.  It's not bad, man.  Okay, Scott educated us.  I'm going to Coney Island tonight.  Yeah, let's go.  I'm going to hop on the train.  I'm going to go there tonight.  We haven't done a live broadcast in a while.  Let's do one two blocks from the first wheel. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Right there in front of the mural.  Yeah.  And everything will be stolen before we hit the air.  In front of Mickey's mural.  Right.  Well, rest in peace, Mickey.  We're going to be there tonight.  Right, right.  At 10.30, 11 o'clock tonight.  Come join us with your fardies.  Broadcasting live.  Hey, look.  I don't know why anybody would want to go to Coney Island in the middle of February at 11 o'clock.  No, this is an older story, by the way.  I'm just saying. 
[00:52:00]  And the only reason I brought up was because of this report over there in Egypt.  There's people that are just way too trusting.  Egypt isn't too bad.  You guys don't know.  You've never been there.  Don't even give me that way.  After the first penis goes in, you're like, what does it matter if there's another hundred?  Yeah.  Fucking Artie Lang on the phone.  Artie.  Now you think you've been to Egypt or something?  It's a great place.  Fuck yourself.  Are you going to...  I mean, I was just trying to... 
[00:52:30]  You can say whatever you want, man.  Is he...  Are you going to remember that he even talked to us today?  Are you going to even remember that you're a provincial little asshole?  I remember it every day when I pull up to my lovely home.  Scott.  Yeah, exactly.  Scott.  So I won't act like you've fucking been down here, and I won't act like I've been down here.  I'm not...  But that...  I've been down.  Scott, that's the point I'm making. 
[00:53:00]  I'm not going to just assume shit.  I am, as a grown man, scared to take the subway to Coney Island, okay?  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not a brave fucking tough guy.  I know that I would not be comfortable doing that.  Now, why don't you admit something to us now and tell us what you've been on the whole fucking phone call.  Scott.  One of the nicest restaurants in the neighborhood.  Nathan's.  Wait, I want to know what the nicest...  What's the nicest restaurant in the neighborhood there, Scott? 
[00:53:30]  Um...  Fashimi for sushi is good.  Fashimi.  You can check it out.  Fashimi.  Best in Brooklyn.  Scott, why aren't you being honest with us?  What do you want this morning?  A little...  Oh, that sounded like a fucking bong, didn't it?  What are you smoking, brother?  Now, why do I got to be high to represent Brooklyn? 
[00:54:00]  I don't know how it helps.  That's fucking out of your mind, man.  I'm an old guy.  Like, back from the day when you guys were on NAW, man.  All right.  We love the NAW people.  Now, listen to me, Scott.  Where are you going to work today?  I'm not going to even say.  At this point, a lot of my friends listen. 
[00:54:30]  What does that mean, though?  Do you have a job?  What industry is it?  Yeah, what industry?  Environmental.  All right.  It's sanitation.  No.  You're a pisser, man.  Stephen S. from Bayshore wants to know if you said shimi for shishishinishish. 
[00:55:00]  I think I pronounced that right.  I hear that.  What was the name of that sushi joint again?  Because Stephen S. from Bayshore wants to go.  Fashimi.  Fashimi.  Fashimi?  I am I.  All right.  I thought that was a new hip-hop word for for sure.  Yo, Fashimi, my...  You know what's the most exciting thing about this conversation?  What?  Hopefully it might make it bad stuff.  Yeah, probably will.  It probably will.  I think you're pretty good.  You're a good caller. 
[00:55:30]  You're a good caller.  All right, brother.  We're going to let you go.  Yeah.  I appreciate it.  Stop being so hard on Big Coney.  I know.  They always do that, and it's actually not that bad a place, right?  Yeah.  The Big Coney.  Danny, can you give me some stats for after the break on the Big Coney?  I would really appreciate that, because maybe we're hitting Coney Island a little hard.  Yeah.  I know they're trying to revitalize the whole place, and you've got new developers in there,  you know, fucking just getting rid of all the riffraff.  Yeah.  He's going to be kissing my ass. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, why don't we take a break?  Because, you know, Coney Island resident got to eat, yo.  Yo, go fuck yourself.  Hey, I got one more thing to say.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I know.  It's the click.  Click.  Yeah.  We saw it coming.  We kind of saw that.  I got one more thing to say, Mr. Faber-Sham.  There's the racial breakdown of Coney Island.  Whoa!  So, let me see.  Wow!  Let me look for my category. 
[00:56:30]  Wow, we're a little...  We're a slice of the pie if you really are watching your weight.  Yeah, we're like a Domino's pizza slice.  Yeah.  What was that, about 15% for us?  Ah, maybe a little less.  A little less, probably.  Well, 25% is a quarter.  25%.  That'd be a quarter of the pie.  We're less than that.  Yeah, we're at about 1 o'clock.  We're from 1 to 3 on the pie chart, right?  Uh-huh.  So, what would that make?  Is it about 10%?  A little more.  A little more. 
[00:57:00]  10%?  Black is huge.  Hispanic is huge.  Black is the size E-Rock would cut out.  I'm kidding, E-Rock, come on.  That'd be a nice slice of apple pie.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Fucking why would the Asians live there?  What's wrong with you?  Asians live.  Someone's got to run the liquor stores.  They live anywhere?  They really will.  What the fuck is wrong with that?  That's what they do.  They run all the stores.  Anywhere, and they'll take it over.  Yep.  And that's not a bad thing.  Asians, like...  I've lived near Asians before, and I feel very safe. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah?  Because, yeah, they really just mind their own business.  Oh, yeah.  I don't...  I never worry about an Asian.  Oh.  Let's get some crime stats.  Um...  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  We'll see some crime stats, yo.  Hmm.  That's, like, also...  Well, you get that.  We'll go to Kevin in New York.  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  Well, Walmart, I guess, is doing a whole African history,  every month thing where they talk about Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[00:58:00]  You go, Martin Luther King Boulevard, the boulevard that's in all the communities,  and we...  It looks towards hope and change and all this good stuff.  And all I'm thinking is, I think there's a lot of crime happens on Martin Luther King  Boulevards.  Yes.  Around varying communities.  Well, it's the famous...  They made it sound like, you know, you walk down Martin Luther King Boulevard and it's  just all this opportunity and everything.  I think the one in Harlem is turning around. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there's a lot of MLKs, right?  I'm not saying every single one, but, you know, for the most part.  Like Chris Rock, right?  Chris Rock let us know that.  Years ago.  If you're at the corner of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Boulevard, there's some violence  going on.  Right.  All right.  Hey, train operator.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Choo-choo.  Now we're going to get some reality here.  I'm talking a subway ride from Manhattan to Coney Island, sir.  Manhattan to Coney Island.  You're doing all right going on the Coney Island lines. 
[00:59:00]  You want to avoid like the A and the C. Those go through East New York and everything  else.  So if you're taking a subway...  That's the end.  But going down to Coney Island, I've seen it at night.  I've seen it at day.  During the daytime, tourists, nothing like that.  You know, it's not the warriors anymore.  But at night, I am legend.  That's what I see.  I am legend.  So it's going down, go home, and lock up. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And it's a long subway ride from Manhattan to Coney Island, isn't it?  It is.  Well, from Manhattan, you've probably got about another 45 minutes.  45 minutes, yes.  Halfway through.  I mean, you'd be surprised who gets off in what areas.  Oh, yeah?  Like, places I never dreamed of.  I've lived in New York all my life.  Places I've never dreamed of going when I was a kid.  All the places I was told, and I'm sure you guys know that you don't go.  There are two places you think now you don't go.  That's what the tourists are getting off.  I've got blonde-haired, blue-eyed tourists getting off on 125th Street, 9 o'clock at night. 
[01:00:00]  Where are you going?  Well, now it's, you know, renaissance.  Yeah, I can't deal with that.  Is 125th that bad, or does it get bad as you go a little higher?  It gets bad as you go a little higher, then it gets good again.  Yeah.  Strangely enough, somewhere around, like, 135th Street.  That's where you get around, like, Columbia and all that, and it starts getting better.  And even up at the top, all up at 207th Street, it's not too bad.  It's a Spanish neighborhood, and everybody just pretty much minds their own business.  What about Flatbush? 
[01:00:30]  Well, once I go there.  I mean, really, once you get out there, you've got Brooklyn College, and that's it.  After that, you know, stay in one spot there, Whitey.  All right, so maybe I was over-paranoid, but it's not my responsibility to have to fucking worry about her.  Better to err on the side of safety.  Fuck yeah.  The best thing to do is go down with more than, you know, you and your 18-year-old girlfriend.  You go down with maybe a mob of you, and you'll get left alone.  But you just want to go down there with just a pair at that point?  I don't even know.  Just two that are very book smart, but have no street smarts. 
[01:01:00]  I just go down there dressed like, makeup like Paul Stanley in a Yankee uniform.  And you're set.  And a few of my friends dressed the same way.  We swing bats.  We're on skates.  God, would they have gotten beaten up in real life?  The only thing down there now is a $4 fucking hot dog.  That's about it.  All right.  Kevin, thank you, man.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  I take the subway, but I just don't go above a certain area. 
[01:01:30]  I just don't.  You don't?  Because what are you doing up there?  There's nothing going on.  Yeah, it's scary.  I mean, you know, not to be a total puss, but still, I take subways down to, like, where  the comedy store is.  I mean, Cellar.  Cellar, sorry.  You know, the village area, Soho.  That's about it.  Cincinnati is supposed to have very good subways.  Get me out of here.  I didn't know nothing in school.  All I knew was Martin Luther King. 
[01:02:00]  That's all I ever teach you in school about Blackpill.  Martin Luther King.  That's my answer to everything.  Martin Luther King.  What's the capital is out here?  Martin Luther King.  Oh, could you tell us the name of the woman that would not leave her seat on the bus?  Oh, that's hard.  Oh, you sure it was a woman?  Oh, I got it.  Martin Luther King.  You know what's so sad, man?  You know what's wild?  Martin Luther King stood for non-violence. 
[01:02:30]  Now what's Martin Luther King?  A street.  And I don't give a fuck.  Will you in America?  If you're on Martin Luther King Boulevard, there's some violence going down.  It ain't the safest place to be.  You can't call nobody and tell them you lost on MLK.  I'm lost.  I'm on Martin Luther King.  Run!  Run!  Run!  The media's there! 
[01:03:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Wow.  Oh, now we're talking.  Oh.  Doggy doggy, Dr. Dre is at the door.  Ready to make an entrance, so back on up.  Cause you know we're about to rip shit up.  Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble. 
[01:03:30]  Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble.  Yeah.  But a cheap thing, baby.  I know you're in trouble.  Too low-deaf, make us so we're crazy.  Death Row is the label that pays back.  Unfadeable, so please don't try to fake it.  But a fact is a way to hand.  Yeah.  Perfection is perfected, so I'm gonna let them understand.  This is on the radio.  You listen?  Uh, this one I probably would.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Roll the windows down, play it real loud.  Yeah.  Lean back in my seat. 
[01:04:00]  Put one hand up, just my wrist on the steering wheel, look at people, shake my head, yeah, motherfucker.  That's what I'm talking about.  In white boy music, what is this the equivalent of now that it's 2011?  You know what I mean?  What year was this?  Like, we're playing this right now as white boys, thinking we're cool.  No, not really.  Well, that's probably what a black man would say to us. 
[01:04:30]  You sound kind of nerdy that you think this is cool in 2011.  So what would the...  But it was cool then.  Right, but that's...  So what's the equivalent of this in white boy music?  Where if, like, a black DJ put on, like, a white...  You know what I mean?  Like, a song from this...  Around this time, thinking it's cool.  This is like listening to Motley Crue's Home Sweet Home.  Like, cool at the time, but now it's like...  I kind of like the Home Sweet Home.  I do, too.  I kind of like the Home Sweet Home. 
[01:05:00]  At the time, it was probably the shit best song ever.  Yeah.  But now it's a little contrived, and you're kind of like, bah.  My favorite Motley song.  Is it?  Yeah, there's a good one.  Smells Like Teen Spirit?  Really?  Nah.  That's still too good.  All right, whatever.  Hey, we got Sam Roberts in studio, because we got...  What?  That's right.  Lucky you.  We got Jericho coming in.  Our friend Chris Jericho.  It's been a while.  You named that Turnpike after him.  I knew it.  I went local. 
[01:05:30]  What's his Twitter name?  I am Jericho.  I am Jericho.  He's got like 200,000 followers.  He does well, man.  He's a talented guy.  We've had our ups and downs with the guy over the years.  He certainly has.  In general, we've had many ups.  Yeah.  There was a down with Jimmy, but that turned around nicely.  I think that built...  I forgot about that.  Yeah, we did forget about that.  We did move on from that.  Yeah.  That was an intense day on the Opinance show.  There's complexities in the relationship.  Couldn't make fun of his hairdo, though.  I just found my...  I was like, Jericho, like you did with Jesse the Body. 
[01:06:00]  No, he is a very full...  Yeah, he had a nice head of hair.  Although he did wear that Pebbles Flintstone thing on his head for a while.  Yeah.  Which we, I think, called a cum fountain.  I think we said...  Yeah, that's cool.  Well, we're on regular.  We're on regular, so we said jizz.  A jizz fountain.  We were allowed to say jizz for a while.  A jizz fountain hairdo.  We called it a jizz fountain hairdo.  He should have punched us in the face for that alone.  Oh, my God, that alone deserved a fucking...  It's TVPG now.  Chris Jericho has a book out called Undisputed that he's promoting.  And he's talented, so I'm going to read his book. 
[01:06:30]  Most wrestling books are not worth the fucking paper to print it on.  But he's talented, and he's got chops, so I think this book's going to be pretty good.  His first book was among the elite in wrestling books.  It was?  Yes.  What was it called?  Was it about his life?  A Lion's Tale?  Yeah.  His first book was...  This is about his life, too?  Yeah, his first book left off when he first started in WWE, like his first night there.  Oh, we had to wait?  That's like Lord of the Rings. 
[01:07:00]  Exactly.  We had to wait.  And I'm proud to say that the Opie and Anthony show made it into Chris Jericho's new book.  Yeah.  We got about a page, page and a half?  Yeah.  What's this about, Sam?  That's why we have you in here today.  Well, he talks about first starting Fozzy, and how at the beginning...  Because now, he's still in Fozzy.  It's like a real band now.  Get the fuck out of here.  He doesn't do the characters.  He's Chris Jericho in Fozzy.  It's like a real band.  They don't do covers.  They do original songs and everything.  Right.  And they tour, but...  We used to get all the wrestlers in, and we were so excited to talk to Chris Jericho, 
[01:07:30]  because he had some heat.  Yeah.  And we finally, I remember, we're like, God, we're finally going to talk to Chris Jericho.  This is when we were all still watching wrestling.  They still do well, but I'm long gone.  And, uh...  Well, now it's for the kids.  Back then, it was like...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  These storylines.  All the entertainment back then, yeah.  So, we got excited.  We're going to have Chris Jericho.  Can't wait to talk to Chris Jericho.  And he comes in as this fucking...  Moon Goose McQueen.  Moon Goose McQueen.  Because when Fozzie first started, they played covers, and they did characters. 
[01:08:00]  So, he decided, yeah, I'll go on your show, but I'm not going on as Chris Jericho.  I'm only going to go on as this guy.  Moon Goose.  Moon Goose.  And so, yeah, so you basically, you two, spent the entire interview trying to get him  to break, taking callers, calling him...  Chris Jericho.  First Chris Jericho, and then, you know, Moon Jizz, and...  Moon Jizz.  Mule Juice McQuaid.  Moon Juice.  Mule Juice McQuaid. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, really?  And Dice was in, too.  I remember that day.  Yeah.  I was in for that day.  It was a great day.  Wow.  And so, he said...  But in his book, he was talking about how he was really going out there, and for every  press thing, protecting the character, he wouldn't break, he wouldn't break, and he basically  says that his toughest obstacle in trying to not break the character was coming on Opie  and Anthony, because you guys just would not let up.  We wouldn't let up.  I'm surprised to read it this way. 
[01:09:00]  On page 84, Opie said, confrontationally...  I've never done that before.  No.  No.  He says, listen, no one cares about Fozzy.  We had you in here because we care about the WWE and Chris Jericho.  I go, settle.  And then he goes, sorry, but I don't know what the WWE is.  I'm the singer of Fozzy.  Yeah.  He kept insisting that Chris Jericho had stolen his look, and then you guys started making  mention of the fact that he was ripping off Spinal Tap. 
[01:09:30]  And then it says, Dice finally piped in.  Listen, he said, who is this guy?  Is he a wrestler?  W-R-E-S-T-L-U-H?  A wrestler!  Or is he a singer?  S-I-N-G-U-H.  Yeah.  Dice went on this whole thing about, you know, so who are you wrestling then?  If you're a singer, so you're going to wrestle Chris Jericho?  So who are you fighting?  You can't be a wrestler and a singer.  And then Chris Jericho in his book says, I said, Dice, I'm a singer.  And then Dice says, well, get off his case then. 
[01:10:00]  He's a singer.  What a fucking asshole.  I miss Dice.  He was also...  Totally picture that.  And that was also in the era where you guys were telling Dice to shut up because he kept  talking over interviews.  He was coming in all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  So he was already pissed at you guys.  He kept taking Jericho's side.  Or Moongoose's side, I should say.  Moongoose, whatever his fucking name was.  You asked, Anthony asked if he was going to put somebody in the McQueen, the walls of McQueen  instead of the walls of Jericho.  The walls of Jericho. 
[01:10:30]  I know you brought in the audio.  Is this audio match up to the book or not really?  One track does.  Okay.  Because then, well, get off his case then.  He's a singer.  And then suddenly in one fell cigarette puff, it was now Moongoose and the Dice Man versus  Opie and Anthony.  Dice got really into what I was saying and became my hype man.  And when I mentioned that, if you look at our songs chronologically, you could see they  were recorded before the other bands released their versions.  Yeah.  Jericho was claiming that everyone ripped him off and he's not a cover band. 
[01:11:00]  He actually came up with these songs.  Yeah, yeah.  He said Fozzie was stuck in Japan for 20 years making demos and then the other bands found  the demos and ripped their songs off.  It was so ridiculous.  We couldn't go with it.  He had a gimmick with this band.  I mean, come on.  Dice didn't know chronologically.  Yeah.  He thought it was choreographing.  So he kept asking Chris if he dances.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because Dice doesn't understand words.  Yeah.  So we did the songs before the other bands released their versions.  Dice backed me up by saying, listen, he must have a pretty good band if they do all those 
[01:11:30]  dance moves.  You a good dancer.  A dancer.  You a good dancer.  So Jericho's coming in here in about a half hour to talk about Undisputed.  It looks like it's going to be an all right book and we got a nice mention, which is kind  of neat.  We got some audio from that day.  You want to play it?  This has never been played on satellite.  Right.  I want to hear some of this.  All right.  Ant gets exhausted by Moongoose.  What's the problem with Cain attacking you when you were trying to...  We haven't moved up to drugs like that.  We're just smoking pot at this point.  Oh, is that? 
[01:12:00]  We don't do those types of drugs.  Oh, right.  No, William Regal and Chris were fighting, I believe.  And then Cain jumped in.  Why don't you give me some background on this Chris Jericho guy.  If you keep insisting on bringing up...  So fucking annoying.  He wouldn't break character and we were just pounding him about it.  Talking about all the storylines that were happening.  Listen to how exhausted Ant sounds.  First thing I'm bringing up is name.  Tell me about him at least.  Clue us in so we can be in on the joke.  Please.  Well, he's fighting for the European title and then Cain's got a problem with him.  I just want to know what the problem is with Cain. 
[01:12:30]  And, uh...  I thought you said he was an American.  Chris.  Jesus Christ.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Is Chris Jericho from Europe?  It's like, come on.  It's Jesus Christ.  What are you doing?  Come on.  Stop it.  It's like a half hour interview and the whole time you guys are just like, please.  At one point you said, okay, fine.  Moon Goose.  Can you leave?  And then have Chris Jericho come in? 
[01:13:00]  Anything.  It was exhausting.  He's right.  Chris is right, though.  He doesn't want to talk about anything but that nonsense storylines.  I know.  Hey, what is the masked marauder?  He left his hat over someone's...  Really?  He was right.  Why is Matt mad?  Who gives a shit, really?  Has someone stepped on someone's foot?  Idiocy.  That's exactly it.  It was more than that, though.  We wanted to know.  There was some good storylines.  What feud were you asking about?  We don't remember anymore.  I have no idea. 
[01:13:30]  I was shocked when Anthony, who now makes fun of me for watching wrestling, dropped William  Regal's name.  Well, you know something, Sam.  Why is William Regal mad?  We used to watch...  If it wasn't for me as a predecessor, maybe wrestling would have folded and you wouldn't  have anything to watch.  So I think instead of goofing on me, you should thank me for being such a fan and buying the  pay-per-views and supporting Vince McMahon and, at the time, WWF.  Dude, we watched everything.  Yes. 
[01:14:00]  Did you?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We were all in.  The storylines were ridiculous.  They wound up getting, like, they had to PG it down and then they had to, like, G rating  it down.  But it was R-rated shit at the time.  It was funny.  Funny as fuck.  Everyone was in on the act.  The acting was terrible.  But The Rock was doing his thing.  He was unbelievable back then.  The Rock rocked that mic.  He was one of the best fucking guys on the mic.  Yeah.  You had him, Stone Cold, and McFoley. 
[01:14:30]  McFoley, fucking Triple H.  They were all, like, in their prime and shit.  At one point, I guess you guys hadn't established a relationship with him.  You guys were saying how much you wanted to have Chris Jericho in studio.  And you go, yeah, we had Mankind in here.  He was a stiff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Here's more Chris Jericho not admitting he's Chris Jericho and he only would do the  Moongoose thing.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mule Juice McQueer.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:15:00]  That's Moongoose McQueen, let me tell you.  Hey, Moke.  Hey, douchebag.  How do you explain that around the time that all that music was made, you were about nine  years old, sucking your thumb?  Oh, well, actually, I'm actually 40 years old, to be honest with you.  It must be all the juice that you're doing that preserves your body.  Well, we actually lived in an all-male bathhouse in the sauna.  That makes sense.  And the steam kept us looking youthful.  Oh, I see.  So, I look pretty good for 40 years old, jackass.  Got an answer for everything, man.  That was a long time ago, man. 
[01:15:30]  It just took forever.  10 years ago.  Yeah, that was.  Maybe a little more?  Because he's actually 40 now.  Jesus.  So, he would have been like 29 then.  Do they still do the giant entrances for wrestling?  Yeah.  Like, the entrances have always been, like, very huge.  Who is this?  That's Kane.  That's Kane.  I don't know who he is.  He's Yannick Haker's brother.  Oh.  What's the matter with you?  This is old, though.  He doesn't wrestle with the mask on anymore, right?  No.  Because at first, he wore the mask because he was burned, and then we realized it was psychological 
[01:16:00]  scars.  Come on.  Like Doctor Doom.  Like Doctor Doom.  Yes.  Wow.  Why are they all in the ring just knocking each other over?  What are they doing?  It's a battle royal.  Battle royal.  What's the matter with you, Jimmy?  And we had Opie and Anthony signs in the audience almost every week.  Yeah.  It got to a point where we were well represented.  No, that's one of the pushwhackers.  Jimmy's doing the wrestling moves.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  That's a pushwhacker.  You've got to go back in further.  The manager's in there with the mustache.  Paul Bearer.  Paul Bearer.  That's who Big A looks like. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, man.  When he did that in the flames, I forgot about that.  Scotty Too Hotty's in there like, oh, shit.  He made the Scotty Too Hotty was in there.  Remember Scotty Too Hotty?  Scotty Too Hotty.  Grandmaster Sex A.  I don't remember that one.  Do you, man?  I remember Scotty Too Hotty.  We remember Scotty Too Hotty.  How ridiculous was that shit?  Going back about 10, 11 years, Chris Jericho not being Chris Jericho.  Chris, have you seen Lita Naked yet?  We just had the debut of the album yesterday. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, that's a good tack.  Something that you won't be able to resist.  Chris, have you seen Lita Naked yet?  Lita Ford?  Look.  Lita.  We actually met Lita Ford back in the late 80s.  Yeah, we've seen Lita Naked.  She's actually fine.  She was real hot.  She had some long blonde hair.  She had some really big guns.  I would like to see Lita Ford on Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  That was quoted in the book.  What?  The Lita.  Oh, was it?  The Lita Ford thing.  I didn't read the whole page yet.  No.  Well, I wouldn't expect you to.  It's a lot of.  It's a big page.  Yeah, that's a lot of reading. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And then finally, Dice.  One last clip from back in the day, back in the day, that is now in the new Chris Jericho  book.  Tell him about the restraining order and why that can't happen.  What are you laughing about?  I think it's hysterical.  What's so funny with you, everything?  Yeah, what's it?  What, Dice?  I'm laughing at you, too.  You think it was a joke working?  You can't even hear this dat tape.  That's right.  You can't even do any chronological steps in here.  You can't hear this.  I can't be on MTV.  All right, listen, listen.  I'm not Dice.  Sebastian Bach is on the line.  I'm not even Dice. 
[01:18:00]  I'm the group Dobie.  Yeah.  I'm Dobie Dice Clay.  Hey, Ant.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Sebastian.  You guys need Dice to write your material for you because you guys are brutal.  No, you like our show.  Shut up, Chris.  Shut up, Chris.  Oh, wow.  Shut up, Chris.  That's tough.  Tough guy talk.  Oh, man.  He's trying to be moon goose.  I remember when that was Stone Cold Steve Austin got the forklift.  Oh, he lifted up Triple H.  He picked up Triple H in the car and then dumped it on the roof and just squished Triple H and probably killed him. 
[01:18:30]  No, he was actually, I mean, I thought the same thing when I first saw it.  He turned out he was all right.  Really?  He was able to make a comment.  We could ask him about it.  He'll be here later this week.  Wow.  Yeah.  I've got to see how his head is from that because that probably would have injured him.  I mean, that was 2000.  He's fine now.  Oh, my God.  That was a while ago then.  He blew off China to marry the boss's daughter.  Well, I mean, he fell in love.  That was a brilliant move on him.  He fell in love.  That's what it was about.  Wow.  Did he trade up?  Holy shit.  In many ways.  I mean, he fell in love with a lovely young woman named Stephanie and that was it. 
[01:19:00]  That's The Rock?  Yeah, that's The Rock and Triple H. That's the Iron Man match.  And The Rock came back, right? He's going to be part of WrestleMania?  Yeah, The Rock came back on Monday.  See, now he might have to watch WrestleMania.  Oh, really?  Recently?  He came back on Monday.  He's going to host WrestleMania.  Oh, host it.  Does he just happen to maybe have a project out?  He specifically went out and said he is not promoting a movie.  He's simply, and it's not for the money, he loves the fans.  Really?  He said it.  But what movie's coming out? 
[01:19:30]  Then coincidentally, is there a movie?  Well, the Super Bowl had the commercial for the new Fast and the Furious movie.  He is in that movie.  Oh, okay.  He's got a lot of stuff going on.  You want to hear The Rock coming back to the WWE for the first time?  Of course.  This went down on Monday, right?  Yes.  Was it a surprise?  Was it a big surprise?  Everybody went nuts.  Did you know?  I mean, a lot of people had assumptions that it was going to be in, but nobody would specifically  say it.  It was too good to be true.  Oh, of course it was. 
[01:20:00]  Did his music start?  Yeah.  After seven long years.  That's him.  Oh, my God.  And then people go, no, no.  Yeah.  Finally.  Finally. 
[01:20:30]  Finally.  That's great.  It's seven years.  Oh, my God.  Finally, the rock has come back to Anaheim.  Doce bumps.  The douche chills.  Oh.  Which means, finally, the rock has come back to Monday Night Raw.  I'm smiling so big when I was watching this.  Oh, yeah.  Huh? 
[01:21:00]  Which means, finally, the rock has come back.  From WrestleMania?  Home.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  I guess the second clip's not worth playing.  What do you mean, not worth playing?  What?  The first one wasn't.  That's why.  The tooth fairy guy is going to put on those outfits again?  He gives a fuck.  Tooth fairy guy.  I look at him better as an actor.  He did all his old catchphrases. 
[01:21:30]  They tried to dump him out once, but I think they were told not to dump him out.  Oh, really?  Because they don't do that type of language anymore.  He told Michael Cole he was going to turn the laptop sideways and stick it straight up  his candy ass.  They don't do that on TV.  Oh, my God.  I got to hear that.  Is it part of the second clip?  Yeah.  Candy ass.  Wow.  I was smiling so big.  I was like, oh, faggot.  So they dump out of ass and all that on WWE?  Well, especially shoved straight.  Yeah, it's TVPG.  Oh, that was like nothing, man.  The Rock got away with saying all that stuff.  Oh, I know.  Oh, it's sad to hear. 
[01:22:00]  He described himself as pie eating.  Just as sure as The Rock turns WrestleMania into the most epic WrestleMania of all time.  And just as sure as anything can and will happen at WrestleMania.  And just as sure as every day John Cena walks out here looking like he just got shot out  of Barney the dinosaur's anus is just as sure as The Rock guarantees three things  at this WrestleMania.  The Rock guarantees to show the world that he is the most electrifying man in all of entertainment. 
[01:22:30]  Not just sports entertainment.  The Rock guarantees at the drop of a dime just like that.  to lay it, to smack it down on all their candy asses.  Oh, come on.  And the last thing and most important.  They dump asses?  The Rock and the millions.  And millions.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not good enough. 
[01:23:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  The Rock and the millions.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's still not good enough.  The Rock is the people's champ.  You are the backbone of The Rock.  When we speak our voice to the heart, we all say, I bring it.  Anaheim, the world is watching.  Anaheim, the world is listening one more time.  When The Rock and the millions.  All The Rock fans go to WrestleMania and electrify WrestleMania and the world like no one else can. 
[01:23:30]  It's just the man.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I did it.  How excited.  But The Rock is moving.  It's not sing-along with the champ.  No, no.  It's not sing-along with the champ.  No.  He'd get so mad.  That's when he was a heel, not when he was babyface.  Yeah, yeah, not babyface.  Babyface, he could sing along with the champ.  Can we please hear from Dwayne Johnson? 
[01:24:00]  Instead of this buffoon.  Oh, man.  There's the music, motherfucker.  I got it.  The crowd, because everything went black and everyone was going like.  People's elbow?  There were like noises.  Come on, people's elbow.  And all the lights were down and all of a sudden it just went.  If you smile.  What The Rock is cooking.  Oh, and they just went like.  Couldn't believe it.  Not The Rock.  Not here.  It couldn't be.  No, no.  Can't be.  Can't be.  It sounded like he was a little rusty doing The Rock. 
[01:24:30]  No, he was in the habitat for 20 minutes.  A little rusty.  He didn't sound like The Rock.  He sounded like Dwayne Johnson.  Yeah, movie star.  There was a little bit.  Dwayne Johnson going, wait, how did I used to do this rock thing?  There's a little bit of disappointment, because for the first part of his promo, for the  first time ever, he was talking in first person.  He was saying, I.  Oh, no, no.  And then he said, like, let me talk to you as Dwayne for a second.  Oh.  And told the fans how much he appreciated them sticking with him.  And going to his movies.  Yeah.  But then The Rock came back and told Michael Cole, shove the laptop, turn it sideways, 
[01:25:00]  stick it straight up his candy ass.  Oh, man.  He told him then.  Yeah, we don't want to see.  We don't want to hear that talk.  We want to hear the laptop talk.  And he started taking shots at John Cena.  You don't know which direction it's going to go in.  No, he's just wild, man.  Yeah, I mean, who knows?  He could end up as, like, a special referee at WrestleMania, and everybody's going to think  he'll turn on John Cena, but then he ends up on John Cena's side.  Who knows?  He's gone rogue.  You never know.  He's not taking a chance.  He's got a movie career to protect.  Yeah, you think he's doing that?  Right.  He's not going to do real bumps. 
[01:25:30]  No.  He's The Rock.  He doesn't take bumps.  Who's going to knock The Rock on his ass?  Nobody.  Good point, Sam.  He dishes it out.  He doesn't take it.  No, no.  We're talking about wrestling again.  What's wrong with us?  It's The Rock.  I wouldn't recognize that song.  The Rock's music?  No.  Even though it starts with, if you smell The Rock's.  If I heard that, I would.  But I mean the music itself.  You should.  All right.  Well, the reason we're talking about all this stuff, Chris Jericho coming in in about  10 minutes to promote Undisputed, his new book. 
[01:26:00]  Damn.  What's this book about if you already did his?  This book is his WWE career from start to...  What was the other one, then?  Everything leading up to his WWE career.  His life.  That's kind of dumb.  Well, it's not dumb.  His whole life is time.  I want the WWE stories.  Well, now he's sold two books.  Yeah.  Well, I guess he isn't dumb.  Yeah.  You're right.  Chris Jericho's a bestseller.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm just joking.  Fucking Jericho's a friend of the show.  All right.  Oh, I found the Charlie Sheen thing that we sort of referenced.  We didn't get to because we were doing a lot of shit.  Oh, my God.  Charlie Sheen is just... 
[01:26:30]  Has he lost his mind, or is he just completely being a realist with this whole thing?  I don't think he lost his mind.  I think there's just people out there that this is what they want for themselves, no  matter what.  Yeah.  Like you said, he tried, you know...  He doesn't want...  He has...  Tried rehab.  Didn't like it.  Has no desire.  He was sober for how long?  I don't even know.  Like seven years or something?  He didn't drink?  And then he was like, oh, that first one.  Ooh.  You heard what was on the episode.  I don't watch Two and a Half Men at all. 
[01:27:00]  No, no.  I don't either.  So I don't even know what this is about, but...  I don't either.  I just heard his interview on ESPN Radio.  Yeah, we're going to get that, too.  What was Jericho's finishing move called?  The Walls of Jericho, I think.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Sam would be sure.  Why you ask?  Because I'm looking in his book, and it's funny.  He's showing a list of possible closing...  What are they called?  Oh, finishing moves?  Finishing moves.  And I guess some of them were pretty awful, and he kind of just shows...  Oh, it was like names that they could have been?  Yeah, the humiliator, buy rate, final count out. 
[01:27:30]  Where is that?  Page 10.  Oh, 10.  Okay.  All right.  But I guess at the end of Two and a Half Men, they throw up...  I don't even know what it's called.  Two and a Half Men creator Chuck Lor put this message about Charlie Sheen at the end of Monday's episode.  I guess they put little messages at the end of every episode, I'm assuming, or something like that.  And Chuck Lor, the creator, had this on the screen after the episode. 
[01:28:00]  I exercise regularly.  I eat moderate amounts of healthy food.  I make sure to get plenty of rest.  I see my doctor once a year and my dentist twice a year.  I floss every night.  I've had chest x-rays, cardio stress tests, EKGs, colonoscopies.  I see a psychologist and have a variety of hobbies to reduce stress.  I don't drink.  I don't smoke.  I don't do drugs.  I don't have crazy, reckless sex with strangers.  And then he writes, if Charlie Sheen outlives me, I'm going to be really pissed.  Wow.  And that's the creator of Two and a Half Men.  See, he's got a sense of humor about it. 
[01:28:30]  At the end of Monday's episode.  They know.  And then you're referring to Charlie Sheen talking to Dan Patrick.  Yes.  Yeah, this was pretty good stuff.  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen is...  I think he's on the old expressway to...  But he's aware.  What do you think of people like Charlie Sheen that have no desire to get sober there, Jimmy?  What's he going to take for him to get sober?  He doesn't want to.  No, he doesn't want to.  What's your opinion on that type of thing?  You think there's just people out there that have no desire whatsoever? 
[01:29:00]  Sure.  I mean...  And would rather, you know, live...  Most of them.  The majority of people don't get sober.  It's unfortunate.  But yeah, I think he's like...  It's hard when you're...  He hasn't lost his gig.  Does it logically that make sense to you in your head?  Sure.  That some people are just way happier partying and they don't really have anything if they  don't have the drugs and the booze?  I don't know.  There's a lot of misery that comes with it.  It's hard to say that banging porn stars makes you miserable.  But there's a lot of misery that comes with it.  Like whether it's sex or anything, there's always a downside to it. 
[01:29:30]  Where's the upside if you get sober?  You just start to live again.  You start to connect with people.  It's really weird.  Like when I'm not acting on sexually, these weird things I do.  Like I go out to lunch with people.  I just do shit.  My whole mind...  Your whole fucking mind...  I know.  But your whole mindset's different when you're doing that.  So if he stopped that, he would probably connect with people a lot better and just feel a lot  more part of...  He said he had.  Would that make him happier though?  I think most people...  If you're smoking coke or if you have to be going to the hospital, you're just putting 
[01:30:00]  on a good front.  I mean, I know it's great to be getting laid and there's probably a lot of laughs, but no  one is at that point where they're going to the hospital and having a great time anymore.  Yeah, after a suitcase of coke gets delivered to your hotel or your house and you're surrounded  by people who don't give a fuck about you.  There's not one of those people that really gives a shit about him.  No.  He's just Charlie Sheen, the rich actor, jerk off.  Do you think he knows that?  Yeah.  I mean, he doesn't give a shit about them either. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  But most people, you're surrounding yourself with people who don't care about you at all.  Which I guess, look, if you're getting blown by four porn girls, it's hard to wonder if  they care about you.  Right.  But it's a tough case to make that he shouldn't do it.  If he wants to do it, let him do it.  Yeah, sure.  Here he is on Dan Patrick a couple days ago.  How'd you lose your voice?  Well, I went back to work and I was banging on the stage door.  Hello?  Where's everybody?  And I don't know what happened.  I guess they're closed. 
[01:31:00]  They won't let you back in?  I died.  Nobody told me.  Nobody told me.  I just figured I was supposed to go back to work because I'm ready.  Wait, you're on hiatus.  No, we're on forced hiatus.  They said, you get ready, we'll get ready.  And I got ready.  I went back.  Nobody's there.  I don't know what to tell you then.  Nobody's there.  Well, wait.  How do they tell you?  You're the star of Two and a Half Men.  So who decides when you get to?  You can't do One and a Half Men.  No, and that was clearly revealed when they had to bring me back this year, you know. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know what to tell you, man.  I'm just, I'm here and I'm ready.  They're not bring it, you know.  When are you scheduled to start shooting again?  I believe August of 2014 at this pace.  I don't know.  It's supposed to be like the 28th or the 29th.  That's what it is.  The 29th and a non-leap year.  Sounds horrible.  He sounds horrible.  Sounds like he's on coke.  He sure does.  But it's like you're fucking up a gig.  They have to put the show, you're making almost two million a week. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  And the show has to be put on hiatus.  What does that tell you?  Like nobody being rational fucks with a gig that's doing that.  Damn.  It's a multi-million dollar job.  Right.  And a painless job for him.  He's good at it.  It's fucking.  He can do it in his sleep.  Yeah, it's a machine at this point.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Everything flows.  He knows everybody.  And he is fucking it up.  He sounds like radio guys.  Yeah, he does.  A bunch of them thrown together or something. 
[01:32:30]  A little Scott Farrell.  There's a little Florentine in there who's obviously stand up.  But he's talking really kind of fast.  He's also very off the wall with his thoughts and what he's saying.  He said, bring it.  Bring it.  I like that.  Bring it.  God, you watch Platoon.  He's so good in that.  You watch Wall Street.  He's phenomenal.  He's so good in that.  First Bueller.  And now he's just.  Yeah, that's actually who he was.  Yeah, really.  And now he's just a disaster. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, bring it.  Shake it up.  I don't know what he's doing, to be honest with you.  I thought there was another clip where he talks about how being sober is boring or something.  Didn't we read that somewhere?  I guess we just don't have the clip.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean.  Maybe he wasn't doing the right stuff sober.  I certainly don't think.  I certainly don't miss getting high, drinking. 
[01:33:30]  You know what I mean?  But for him, he associates so much sex and all that stuff with it.  But it's like, dude, you're Charlie Sheen.  You don't need to smoke coke to get blown by a bunch of girls.  It's like, you know what I mean?  He spends money anyway on these whores.  You don't have to hang out with them.  If you just pay them, they'll fuck you.  You don't have to hang out with them.  What are you paying for the illusion that they like you?  Like, you want to hang out and party?  I never fucking hung out with escorts.  For what?  Why doesn't the family get more involved?  Can they do?  I mean, I've heard that Martin gets used to drinking and does not anymore. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  But it's like, he's an adult.  He's a fucking 40-something-year-old man.  They can't do anything.  He put out some kind of statement saying something like, you know, they're trying.  They're trying, and he only hopes for the best.  But I think even they know.  What more can you do?  Yeah, he's not ready.  It's like, look, if the guy's enjoying it, let him enjoy it.  But I just can't comprehend wanting to hang out with a bunch of porn stars.  And it just doesn't make sense to me.  It's like, fuck them.  But what do you got to hang out and drink and laugh?  Right.  They don't like that.  You're paying to fuck them, stupid. 
[01:34:30]  Pay them.  Fuck them.  Right.  Well, maybe he likes that, but then likes the hanging out and doing drugs.  If he's not alone doing it.  You know, that would be a little odd to be sitting there by yourself just snorting coke  and have a drink in the air going, woo, woo.  He wants people around like a party.  He's embarrassing himself.  Yeah.  You're embarrassing your family.  If it's at a point where you're going to the hospital in New York and you're having  these altercations where the girl took your wallet and you're freaking out in the hotel, 
[01:35:00]  it's not just the guy was drunk or high and somebody broke into his house and said,  wow, this guy's laughing and getting blown by eight people.  Yeah, yeah.  He's bringing it to everyone's attention because he's going to the hospital.  That's where it's a problem.  It's affecting his work and he's going to the hospital.  If he's just getting high alone and nobody knew about it, who cares?  Thank God for Emilio Estevez's horrid career as an embarrassment to the family because  he looks a little better.  At least he's got a hit show.  I think Emilio's directing or something.  Maybe he's proving a point.  Oh, is he?  I think so.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  He did a Bobby Kennedy movie or something.  I'm supposed to be good.  Yeah, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's actually on the other side of the camera doing well.  Oh, is that what he's doing these days?  Yeah.  He's one of those guys that moved to the other side of the camera.  Well, fuck me running.  Sure.  I have no clue what Emilio is up to.  Judd Nelson?  What's he up to?  I think he's on the other side of the camera, too.  They always go to the other side of the camera.  I think he's doing well, though.  I'm on the other side of the camera now.  I don't know.  Someone's saying, Joe C, Stan Allen, he's a rock star. 
[01:36:00]  Who cares?  He's just living that rock star fucking life.  He is, but those guys always drop dead before they're supposed to.  You've got to stop the rock star lifestyle at his age.  Yeah.  It's great through your 20s and 30s, maybe, but after that, there's plenty of guys that  have dropped dead long before that.  It's all fun, and we hear the stories, but you don't see the misery of the...  Well, how about the fucking whatever happened with his wife in Colorado or his ex-wife  or whatever it was? 
[01:36:30]  There was the arrest.  A little domestic going on or something.  Yeah.  If you're doing that shit, it's not fun anymore.  I mean, Ozzy, we hear all these great stories about what a maniac he was, but then he tries  to kill his wife, and he fucking does things that you're like, oof.  Yeah.  Like, you got so lucky there that you're just not in jail for the rest of your life.  Uh-huh.  It's not just pissing outdoors anymore.  It's awful stuff.  The guy could actually go to jail.  Yeah.  It's like, what happened to one of these girls' overdoses?  Eventually, one of them is going to die in your fucking house. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  With cocaine that you bought?  I have to call Michael Corleone.  Yeah.  Right.  She doesn't have any family.  It's okay.  We'll take care of it.  Satan in Virginia.  Satan.  What up, guys?  Hi, Dev.  Jimmy, how long were you an actual drug addict for?  I mean, I'm going to completely acknowledge that you love to bang whores.  Yeah, yeah.  I was not...  It was mostly alcohol.  It was true about my teenage years.  A few years.  It didn't last that long, bro.  All right.  Well, I'm just...  Because, basically...  I mean, Charlie Sheen's a fucking disaster. 
[01:37:30]  There's no question about that.  Yeah, but I just...  I guess whenever you comment on drug addiction, it just kind of throws me off, because I know  you really didn't have a problem with that.  But I did.  My main one was alcohol, and normal people don't behave the way I behaved.  Normal people don't pull box cutters on people, or cut themselves, or just call the FBI.  You know, I was...  Dude, I knew...  I would have been dead by the time I was 25.  I never would have kept going.  So, it doesn't last that long, but I don't need it to. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Now, how is your...  Like, are you doing pretty good with the sex addiction now, or are you still...  Yeah, the hard part of the sex addiction...  It's not hard to really not fuck people.  The hard part is, like...  It's like the fucking pornography.  It's the spending hours where you fucking...  You know what I mean?  It's like...  You start...  The way I trigger myself is I'll look at one thing, and then all of a sudden, I'm on fucking  X-Tube, or I'm on PornTube, and it's three hours later, and I'm not blowing a load, and  I'm doing it to be...  To escape.  It's like...  Is this a problem?  It's just... 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, but your dick is like a fucking piece of knotted rope.  You're like, what am I doing?  I don't want to talk to anybody.  I'm fucking...  No, it's not...  You know what I mean?  I acknowledge that.  Yeah.  I have a serious porn addiction, too.  Anytime I go out of town for training or something, I find myself just fucking bored.  Right.  You know, just scoping porn for three hours, but...  Well, you convince yourself that it's a part of who you are.  Like, when I write, a lot of times, I start looking at porn, and it's like, when I hit  a wall writing, I look at porn.  It's like this weird thing I do, and then I go back to the writing, so I don't sit there 
[01:39:00]  just in this thick room with no thoughts when I'm writing.  At least you got writing.  I just sit there and beat it off for three hours.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, good deal, dude.  By the way, I fucking love your comedy.  You need to come to Virginia again.  Thank you.  I'm sure I will.  He's going to be in Cincinnati.  Yes.  This weekend.  Why are they blurring out...  Funny bone.  I'm sorry.  That's okay, buddy.  Why are they blurring out the faces of the Egyptian savages that are around Lara Logan in the 
[01:39:30]  famous pictures now?  I don't know.  That's like just before she was attacked?  Unless that was her crew and they're protecting them.  I don't know.  I don't think it's her crew.  Maybe they didn't get the rights.  The lawyers might have said you have to bleep it.  No, it's probably those guys, you know, then people are thinking those were the guys  that sexually assaulted her.  That's what I'm thinking.  But who gives a fuck?  What are they going to sue?  I'm just saying, yeah, maybe they don't want to go down that road because maybe those  guys weren't the ones.  How could they sue?  But who cares?  I'm not saying it's right, by the way.  I'm just...  Oh, I know.  I'm thinking what the...  You know...  Oh, I know absolutely what you're saying. 
[01:40:00]  That's not the same thing I'm thinking is why they did it, but why do it anyway?  These are fucking...  You see that picture and you just assume everyone in that picture, you know, got a taste.  They just had their uncut cocks out.  So they're probably...  I wonder if anybody actually fucked her, like, in a mob of people.  It says brutally and sustained sexual assault.  It has to be.  It has to be.  Fucking animals.  It has to be.  Yeah.  Fucking animals.  Keep going over there, Americans.  Keep fucking standing in the groups and trying to show them jubilant.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking let them treat each other the way they want to treat each other. 
[01:40:30]  You know, just to hear the jackass news people going like, and it must have just been  a wonderful, wonderful, the jubilation in there, the people look great, and just to  know that that was going on right when they were saying that.  Yuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dictators are needed.  Listen, we've got to cut the short.  We can go back to it, certainly.  We've got Chris Jericho, so we're going to take a small break.  Oh, yeah.  Get Chris Jericho in to promote his new book. 
[01:41:00]  Good friend of the show.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho, the sexy beast of the WWE and the lead singer of Fozzy, and this  is Opie and Anthony.  Listen up, kids.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Sounds like Fozzy to me, huh?  Should bring Chris.  Let's get Chris Jericho in here. 
[01:41:30]  His new book is called Undisputed.  How to Become the World Champion in 1,372 Easy Steps.  Wise ass.  Chris Jericho, what's up, brother?  Yes.  We are flattered that we made your book, sir.  Absolutely.  Do you remember that day?  Of course.  Do you remember that story?  First of all, call in the extra security because Norton and Jericho are sitting next to each  other.  Yeah.  There you go.  We're called a harsh for Norton.  Yeah, we talked about that, too.  Well, that story will go in the next book.  That was hilarious, man. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, that was a good one.  But actually, Jimmy and I actually did a show together, Z-Rock, and we had a blast on it.  It was great.  It was actually really good.  Yeah, we had a good time.  No, we said you guys got over that day.  Oh, we did.  We did.  It was a long time ago, but it made great radio.  It did.  It should have made this book.  Well, no, because the time frame of when that happened isn't within this book's time.  So this one ends in like 2007.  Chris, I was calling you a dummy, and I'll tell you why.  Because Sam says this is the book that has all the WWF, WWE stories in it.  And I'm like, that's dumb.  The first book should have had that. 
[01:42:30]  And then Jimmy reminded me, well, no, because it was a bestseller.  So he's doing it.  Right.  And he knows exactly what he's doing.  And if you actually would have read the first book, you would understand why it was written  that way.  Because I had so many stories and tales to tell from my time before the WWE.  It's not like my career, it took me nine years before I got to the WWE.  Right.  It's not like now where it's got nine months for guys.  So there was a lot of stories to tell and a lot of places that I went to to get there.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I want to slow you down.  I'm on track.  I'm talking too fast. 
[01:43:00]  No, but an interesting thing you just said.  These guys coming up are getting right to the big leagues in nine months.  Yeah, but that's just the way that it is nowadays.  I mean, but you had to like wait your turn and really put in your time.  The difference is I wouldn't change it because I got to hone my craft.  You know, it's like being, you know, like a standup comedian and working on all the little  dives.  So by the time you get on to Leno, see, I'm doing a shameless Norton pandering here.  Yeah.  You really got your game down pat and you kill it.  And that's what it was like for me when I got to the WWE.  Although it wasn't like that in the first year and a half.  It was a nightmare when I first got to the WWE. 
[01:43:30]  And that's kind of the crux of the book as well.  The difference with the WWE I have found is when we were watching a lot, we openly admit  we don't watch as much.  Like when you came in with Fozzie the first time, we were all in.  We watched all the pay-per-views, all the Raws, you know, whatever.  Whatever Vince threw at us, we were watching.  We've moved on just because our lives are different.  But the point, back then, it took forever for them to introduce a new wrestler.  And when I do take a peek or I talk to Sam about wrestling here and there, it seems like 
[01:44:00]  these guys are just coming through much quicker.  Well, yeah.  And you don't see the same type of experience level.  You don't see the same type of knowledge.  And that was the thing.  Like for me, because I've been around the world doing this for nine years, when I got  to the WWE and faced a lot of animosity at first, I was able to reevaluate and reinvent  myself because I had all these different experiences I could fall back onto.  Guys now don't have those experiences, both in the ring and in life. 
[01:44:30]  You know what I mean?  So it's a different world where there's not as many great charismatic characters because  guys aren't taking as many chances because they're not really too sure.  They don't have that confidence level to be able to do that.  Yeah.  And you were always one of those guys.  I like that chapter.  Yeah, this is great.  You were always one of those guys that were bigger than wrestling.  You were going to do more.  Well, I always treated it like show business because when I was a kid, I wanted, I mean,  I was a musician way before I was a wrestler.  I've been playing in bands since I was 12 years old.  So I always wanted to be a wrestler and a rock star.  Those are my two dreams.  I was stupid enough to have these two ridiculous dreams when I was a kid and stupid enough 
[01:45:00]  to chase after both of them.  So for me, when I first started wrestling, it wasn't about, you know, Hulk Hogan or Ricky  Steamboat.  The guy that I wanted to be in the ring was like the Paul Stanley of wrestling or the David  Lee Roth of wrestling.  So much charisma and personality and be like the party host because I was a smaller guy.  So how could I raise up through the ranks?  I could be the biggest character.  I have the biggest personality.  It didn't matter what my physical size was.  So I've always treated it that way as a result.  Right on.  Yeah.  I'm reading this chapter about, uh, just before he's meeting Ozzy. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, uh, Zach and Ozzy.  I'm just reading Zach and Ozzy stories.  It's great.  Well, Zach has, Zach and I got in a beard growing contest in 1999 or 2000 or so.  And obviously Zach killed me.  Yeah.  His beard is down to his fucking cock now.  But that's how it started.  We had a beard growing contest and that story and many more is in this book.  Yeah.  The book's going to do very well.  Uh, man, we were playing old clips when you came in.  Yeah.  As Fozzy the first time.  We were so frustrated that you would not break character. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, is that funny?  And then Dice decided to take your side.  Because he was kind of confused or he was just working that he was.  A wrestler.  A singer.  Is he a wrestler or a singer?  And then I said, because what happened was, for people that don't know, we started Fozzy  as an 80s cover band called Fozzy Osbourne.  And because Chris and Rich from Stuck Mojo were in the band, there was like a bidding war  for a record contract for whatever reason.  And Johnny Zazula, who signed Metallica and Anthrax, signed Fozzy as a cover band and said,  you know, are you guys ready to become the next Metallica? 
[01:46:30]  And we were like, are you wearing fucking wigs and playing covers?  So we started out.  And so that's when I said, listen, we can't just be a cover band that's boring.  Let's do like a Blues Brothers, Traveling Wilburys, Spinal Tap type thing, have alter egos and  play it like Andy Kaufman did with Tony Clifton.  When you see Jericho, it's Jericho.  When you see Moongoose, it's Moongoose.  And there will never be a character break.  And that's what we did.  And then when we came into your studio, I would not break character.  I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't do it.  And you guys were getting really pissed off. 
[01:47:00]  Really frustrated.  And so Dice was with you guys.  And he was, you know, confused or stoned or just not caring.  And he's like, what is he, a wrestler?  Is he a singer?  What is it?  I'm Dice.  I'm a singer.  I'm Moongoose McQueen from Fozzy.  And I mentioned that I said that, you know, chronologically, if you look at the songs  we're playing, they were stolen by other bands, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And he said, so you do a lot of dance moves?  And it took me a couple minutes to realize that he thought chronologically was choreography.  Of course he did.  He got that mixed up. 
[01:47:30]  Why wouldn't he think that?  So then I was like, oh, I'm totally in on this.  Yeah.  So the name of the chapter is actually Moongoose and the Diceman versus Opie and Anthony.  So there you go.  You guys are immortalized forever in print.  We certainly appreciate that.  That's for sure.  It is.  But the cool thing is I've been on your show a dozen times since then.  It actually was, that was the first time it was the start of a, you know, fun relationship.  We were excited because we really, you know, liked you in the WWF. 
[01:48:00]  That was what the most frustrating part was because at the time we were, like I said, completely in.  Yeah.  And there was a lot of, like, storylines and action going on.  And so it's like, oh, yeah, Chris Jericho's coming in.  Let's talk to him about all these things that are going on.  We'll get some behind the scenes comments and shit like that.  And you would not mention one fucking thing about Chris Jericho, WWF, nothing.  And we're just like, come on.  At one point, I think I get so disgusted.  What do I just say?  I said, I go, Jesus, Chris. 
[01:48:30]  Could you just for a second give it to us?  Throw us a bone here, please.  Well, we did a, they used to have a show called Sunday Night Heat that was on MTV.  And they used to do it out of the world in Times Square when the WWE owned that.  So Fozzy was playing that night.  And it's still when we were doing the Fozzy gimmick.  And I remember talking to Vince McMahon because he didn't want me to be Moon Goose.  He wanted me to be Chris Jericho.  I'm like, Vince, they're two separate characters.  I said, he goes, well, you can't be trying to fool our fan base by playing a character.  And I was like, what are you talking about? 
[01:49:00]  You made an entire fucking empire out of that.  And I said, I'm doing an Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton thing.  I mean, have you ever heard of that?  He's like, no.  I said, don't you know who Andy Kaufman is?  I don't give a fuck about Andy Kaufman or Tony Clifton.  You're not going out there.  So we had this big argument about Moon Goose McQueen.  I'd been in the company for six months.  No wonder I almost got fired six weeks into my career there.  And Vince should study Andy Kaufman.  He's perfect for Vince.  The Kaufman-Clifton dichotomy.  We had Clifton in here.  Did you really?  It was kind of cool. 
[01:49:30]  When?  Because I'm a huge Andy Kaufman fan.  It's got to be over a year ago now.  So was his manager still doing it?  Yeah.  I just saw him in the airport Friday night going to Vegas.  He walks up.  He goes, hey, Bob Zemuda.  Bob Zemuda, right?  Yeah, it was Bob.  And he was dressed as Clifton.  And he wouldn't break character.  He had the girls and stuff.  Amazing, yeah.  He was going to the Bunny Ranch.  Those guys love him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Him and Andy apparently partook.  What do you think of Vince?  You know, it's funny because in this book, when I first got to the WWE, literally, like  I said, six weeks in, I came in with the biggest entrance in history, coming in with 
[01:50:00]  The Rock, doing this big confrontation.  I had the big buildup, like you said, with the vignettes and the countdown clock.  And literally six to eight weeks later, I was sitting in his office and I thought  he was going to give me a pat on the back for a good job.  And basically, he was like, you are the drizzling shits.  You're green as grass.  Your contract isn't worth the paper.  It's printed on.  Drizzling shits.  Drizzling shits.  You are the drizzling shits?  I had never been told I was the drizzling shits before.  Wow.  And what were you thinking? 
[01:50:30]  What I was thinking was, it was like nine years it took me to get there.  So fuck if I was going to be drummed out of here in nine weeks.  So I just sat there.  I was at Kevin Bacon in Animal House.  Thank you, sir.  May have another one.  Thank you, sir.  May have another one.  So that's when I realized, man, I need to change some things around and do some things  differently.  But that's the thing about the book is it kind of does have a real evolving relationship  with me and Vince.  We started out as real butting heads.  But what's his problem?  Is he too controlling?  Because I remember that time very clearly. 
[01:51:00]  And you were killing it.  So how could he possibly have a problem with you?  And we've talked to enough of you guys over the years.  And we've noticed there's a love-hate thing going on.  I mean, Mick Foley does his show a lot.  And he wanted to be that commentator.  But he told us stories about how Vince is yelling in his ear, you're doing it wrong.  Say this, say that.  He seems very controlling.  And does that get to you guys after a while?  It did in the early days.  But at this point, I actually have a real deep respect for Vince.  And it's reciprocal.  But when I first got there, there wasn't that respect.  And it did drive me crazy because I really was behind the eight ball. 
[01:51:30]  Because he doesn't care what you've done outside of his walls.  So you really have to prove yourself to him over and over and over again.  Yeah, it does make sense.  But I didn't realize that when I first got there.  I'm Chris Jericho.  I was a star in Japan.  I was a star in Mexico.  The fuck?  And it wasn't that way.  He could care less about it.  And once you figure that out, I mean, he really did teach me a lot about wrestling.  He was always talking about life lessons.  I'm not trying to teach you about wrestling.  I'm trying to teach you about life lessons.  Life lessons.  And now, you know, being 40 years old and looking back to when I was, you know, 30, 29 years old working for him, it makes sense. 
[01:52:00]  You know, it's like your dad.  Your dad used to be pissed off.  And I hate this guy.  And then when you get older, it's like all he was trying to do was teach me things so I could be a better person.  Not to sound too cheesy.  But is he intimidated by anybody, do you think?  Or is he kind of the top dog around anybody?  He is the alpha male.  He's not intimidated by anybody as far as I can say.  And whether it's Jesus Christ himself, he doesn't give a shit.  But so he's a very intimidating presence.  He's larger than life.  And that's another thing to have to get over as well. 
[01:52:30]  But once you do, he's one of the guys.  He loves ACDC.  He loves Rolling Stones.  He loves, you know, babies.  Stuff that you would never expect.  Much to popular belief.  Yeah, that was the question I was going to ask if he actually has fun with his life.  He's a great guy.  You can have a good time with him.  We've had him on over there.  He doesn't do our show often.  And it's been a long time at this point.  But yeah, he's a good guy.  We were never able to really figure him out.  Well, he's a maverick, man.  He started this whole thing when everyone said it was going to fail.  You know, it's like all of us.  When we first said we want to get into show business, radio, comedy, music, whatever, wrestling, people said, oh, you'll never do it. 
[01:53:00]  You'll never do it.  And it's the same with Vince.  And when you finally get past that, it's like he had this dream and made it happen.  And, you know, so did you and you and you and me.  So it's like you have that in common with him.  Let's get back to the book, Undisputed.  And I love the chapter title.  So very, very creative.  Like, never trust the Loch Ness Monster.  Well, that stemmed from I had a dream one night that Vince hired the Loch Ness Monster to wrestle me in a pay-per-view.  So, yeah, I had this dream.  And the finish of the match was supposed to be that the Loch Ness Monster was going to swallow me. 
[01:53:30]  And I was like, Vince, I can't trust the Loch Ness Monster.  You can never trust the Loch Ness Monster.  He's going to eat me.  No, of course.  And Vince was like, you know, because Vince is very much, I wouldn't ask you to do anything that I wouldn't do, pal.  And when I said that, he said, well, Chris, I was in his mouth this morning.  He did a great job with it.  So, and so I told Vince about this dream that I had.  I was like, you know, Vince, I had this dream last night that, you know, you signed the Loch Ness Monster to wrestle me.  He goes, Loch Ness Monster, huh?  Is he available? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, so, you know, and that's, you know, like I said, the thing about, another cool thing about the book is,  I'm at the pinnacle of wrestling.  I'm working for the WWE.  I'm wrestling against thousands a night.  And then the next night I'm playing, you know, in front of 15 people with my band Fozzy in Peoria, Illinois.  So it's like the dual story of how I get the band off the ground in one aspect as I was kind of at the top of the ladder in the other aspect.  It's kind of how I made that other dream.  Getting back to the Loch Ness Monster.  I'm sorry.  No, just because who didn't you trust in the WWF at the time? 
[01:54:30]  Oh, you're trying to get Freud on me here.  I'm trying to figure out what the fucking thing was.  I mean, I don't believe in that dream reading crap, but that one seems very obvious, that there was someone you just was like,  Look, man, I don't trust that guy with my, you know, my neck or whatever in my life.  I think it was just all the pills I took that night or something, you know, all the drugs I was taking that day.  Were you taking a lot of drugs?  No, I'm joking.  You never know with you guys.  Some of you guys have openly admitted it.  I was never a drug guy.  I just drank, drank a lot, to the point where I was listening to what Jimmy was saying earlier, becoming somebody else. 
[01:55:00]  They actually had a nickname for me.  They would call me Drunkako.  Drunkako?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Drunkako is actually one of the chapter titles.  Drunkako would come out and throw glasses against the wall.  And, you know, actually, there's a story in there.  Me and Adrian Smith from Iron Maiden and Paul Gargano, the guy who was the editor for Metal Edge, and my friend from Calgary, Spewey, who loves Opie and Anthony, we went to Broadway to see Sebastian Bach do Jekyll and Hyde.  Right.  Afterwards, we went to this pub and just got fucking totaled and, like, you know, pouring beer on each other and spitting alcohol on each other's face and squirting ketchup on each other's heads. 
[01:55:30]  And, you know, just getting that type of drunk or Drunkako would, like, take a drink and throw it against the wall, take another drink and throw it against the wall.  And then I cornered Adrian Smith and told him, I'm going to tell you every song that you've ever written in Iron Maiden.  Well, I know every song I've ever written.  I don't fucking care.  Prisoner.  Gangland.  The evil that man do.  Two minutes to midnight.  And he's just sitting there, like, staring at me.  This guy's like an idiot.  And then rolling on the floor and smashing glasses. 
[01:56:00]  And finally, the next day, Sebastian Bach, you know, one of the craziest guys ever in rock and roll, gets this letter from the pub.  Dear Sebastian, you're welcome to come to my club at any time.  But Chris Jericho and his friends are never allowed again.  That type of behavior is intolerable.  Drunkako strikes again.  Drunkako.  I like the name.  There's a chapter, and hold on to your fucking hat, man.  Oh, what do you got?  Vince loves apes.  Oh, yeah?  Vince loves apes.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  Well, what's up with that is I was doing this thing where I would always, you guys remember, always berate Stephanie and always, like, call her a slut and a whore. 
[01:56:30]  This is the boss's daughter.  And I would go to tell Vince, you know, Vince, I want to call Stephanie a slut today or, you know, and he'd be like, well, just make sure you pause so that the crowd can react afterwards.  The consummate businessman.  So we were doing this thing in Anaheim where I was going to come out there and insult Stephanie.  And so we kind of had the thing all written, and then the head writer called me and said, listen, we have a little bit of a problem.  I said, what?  He said, well, we're doing this thing with Planet of the Apes, the movie that was remade by Tim Burton. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  And Vince loves apes.  So he wants the apes to be involved in your promo with Stephanie.  And I said, what does he want us to do?  He says, I don't know.  He wants you to figure it out.  Oh, that's great.  How the fuck am I going to figure it out?  I got to bring apes down.  And so actually, we actually in a really crazy way made it work where I said, you know, Stephanie has slept with every man, woman, child, hermaphrodite on this planet. 
[01:57:30]  She's had so much sex in this world.  She had to go to another planet to find, you know, conquest, like the planet of the apes, for example.  And here come the apes all walking down like apes.  And they came to the ring with a box of a present for her.  And you open the box and it was a cake.  And then we put the old cake in the face routine.  And people cheered.  And she was mortified.  And the apes danced around with their limbs jimbling and jombling.  And that's how I made that work.  And Vince Vaughn just going, girl, great job. 
[01:58:00]  Dude, great job humiliating my daughter.  When I came to the curtain, he gave me a standing ovation.  I had had five star matches that he didn't even look at.  He gave me a standing ovation for that stupid shit.  Will he tell you if he doesn't like a match?  And if you go backstage, will he go like, that was something wrong?  He'll take his glasses down like this and go.  Oh, shit.  You guys can't see it, but he gives you the old finger.  The finger.  The finger, yeah.  Come here.  And you go sit down and be like.  Takes off his headphones, takes off his glasses, and then just tells you exactly.  Gives you a little what for, as Buddy Rich would say. 
[01:58:30]  What is it like, what, you weren't putting your all into that?  Yeah, like, what the fuck were you doing?  What do you mean?  And it was the exact opposite of what I wanted, and this was bad, and your instincts were terrible,  and this was wrong.  Wow, that's got to suck.  Yeah, he has no problems telling you if he thinks he didn't like something.  And sometimes he's right, and sometimes you're thinking, man, the crowd is going nuts, and  I loved it, but it just depends what kind of mood he's in.  Yeah, I'm fucking bruised up and beaten, and I come back here to get yelled at by this guy.  I just did a segment with apes, and now you're yelling at me.  Now you want me to lose to the Loch Ness Monster? 
[01:59:00]  This photo of you choking Adrian from Iron Maiden, too.  You've got some great pictures in here.  Yeah, well, that was cool, too, Jimmy, because it was like, I was able to finagle myself backstage  to Maiden in 2000, which was the first time I'd ever met them, and Adrian's wife was there  and said, oh, you're Chris Jericho, the wrestler.  My son is a big fan.  Can you come call him?  So here I am, like, oh, my God, I'm going to call Adrian Smith's son.  And that was the first time I ever realized, like, I'm not just some fanboy or actually  have a little sway myself.  And then Adrian and I became friends because of that, which was like the first time I ever experienced 
[01:59:30]  that, you know, like when you get to a certain level of, you know, fame or celebrity or whatever  in one area, and all these other guys dig that, too.  And you said Zach was a fan, too.  Oh, Zach is just a great guy.  I mean, you know how he is, yeah.  So he always loved the ultimate warrior.  He's obsessed with the ultimate warrior.  Bro, bro, how's James Helwig?  Tell me about James Helwig.  Helwig was James Helwig.  Who doesn't love watching the warrior?  The warrior.  Especially now.  Jesus Christ is out of his mind.  Yeah.  Always.  He actually changed his name to ultimate warrior. 
[02:00:00]  Ultimate warrior.  That's his name on his...  Warrior.  He gets pulled over by the cops, and the license says warrior.  Ultimate warrior.  Yeah, ultimate warrior.  Exactly.  What a nut.  The book looks really good.  Oh, shit.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it's getting a lot of buzz on it, a lot of good reviews and all that stuff.  Yeah, that's a big book, man.  Also signings, too, to plug the signings.  Today, there's a signing.  You have to.  These are the way to come, and you meet Chris, and you get your book signed.  And today at noon, at Borders, it's 100 Broadway here in the city.  And then tonight, if you can't make that one, it's 8 o'clock at the book review. 
[02:00:30]  It's a speaking and a book signing, and that's at 313 New York Avenue in Huntington.  Oh, it's my hometown there.  Yeah.  Huntington.  That bookstore's great.  My restaurant's right up the street.  I think we've been there before.  Yeah.  And tomorrow you're in Boston.  Barnes & Noble at 7 o'clock on Beacon Street in Boston.  Very cool.  The signings are even mobbed.  You've done quite a few books, right?  I've done a few.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been a while.  Three, maybe?  Two or three.  Two books, and I mean, the book signings are a lot of.  Two books.  That's great, man.  It's fun, yeah.  You mentioned Benoit there. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you couldn't write a book without mentioning it.  And that's the thing about this book that's different from the first one.  There are a lot of, like, it's a little bit of an emotional roller coaster, and there's  some really heavy, deep things to talk about.  But especially in the Benoit situation, it was so cool for me to, not cool, but cathartic,  I guess is the word, to write about this and get it out of my system to put on the printed  page.  So now I don't ever really have to talk about it.  If you want to know my thoughts and issues, you can just read about it.  Were you guys close?  He was my best friend in wrestling. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, absolutely, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  Beyond.  So that's why, I mean, you had to, I had to deal with this and talk about it.  I just want to ask one.  Did you see him changing?  Did you see any?  Well, I talk about it in the book.  You saw him changing a lot after Eddie Guerrero died, because Eddie was his best, best, best  friend.  And, but he was, you know, he was a great guy, very polite, very positive, like a mentor  at first, and then became a very good friend.  But he was a very strange, strange guy. 
[02:02:00]  Like, especially when you look back, and that's kind of what I talk about a lot, certain things  that happened years before would be like, he wouldn't laugh at something that was like  the funniest bit you'd ever seen, you know, like, you know, I don't know, dumb and dumb  or something ridiculous like that.  And if you played that for him, he would just sit there and kind of like go, you know, nothing.  And you don't, you think this is funny?  Oh, it's funny.  It's, I'm laughing inside.  That type of thing.  And then if somebody threw up on the street, he would find that the funniest thing. 
[02:02:30]  So that type of a guy, you know, so, and like I said, it's, it's interesting to,  to, to kind of separate this guy that I knew for 15, 16, 18 years with, from the guy in  the last two or three days of his life.  I mean, it's a very, it's a very strange, you know, talking about it and you want to  laugh and stuff, but then there's always this black cloud hanging over it.  But I think I tried to explain to people that didn't know that he was, you know, he was  a human being.  He was, you know, he was, he wasn't just some kind of a crazy maniac monster. 
[02:03:00]  He was a great guy, loved his family, loved his kids.  I would have left my kids with him and had no problems.  No reservations more than almost anybody else, you know, in the world.  I would have left them with him.  So that's why to be able to write about it and kind of dig into it a bit was very, like  I said, very cathartic for me.  And I'm glad I was able to do that.  You guys are almost like fucking like soldiers on a battlefield because a lot of wrestlers  have, have died at a much younger ages than, than they're supposed to. 
[02:03:30]  How do you deal with stuff like that?  Because it is almost like you, you would get a, uh, post-traumatic stress from, from some  of this stuff.  You certainly know a lot of your buddies dying like that.  Yeah, you know, a lot of them pretty, pretty well that, uh, yeah.  I mean, like I said, Eddie was a great friend of mine too.  And that his, his death is in there too.  Uh, you know, it's what the worst part of it is.  It really desensitizes you.  I mean, in my, in my first book I wrote about, uh, this guy called Art Bar that, that passed  away.  It was a friend of mine that I worked with in Mexico and that was the first guy that 
[02:04:00]  I'd ever knew that, that had died, you know, of drugs since then I could probably tell  you, and this is not a, not a joke, probably 40 guys and girls that I was friends with or  knew or was best friends with in some cases that, uh, that have, that have passed away.  Oh my Christ.  So yeah, it is, it's, it's, it's crazy, but you become, it's like, oh, you hear so-and-so  died.  It's like, well, you know, I saw that coming.  And again, that's exactly what I'm talking about.  Like, like if you hear soldiers talk about going out and the first time one of their 
[02:04:30]  buddies gets it or something, they're, they're freaking out.  And then after a full tour or two tours, it becomes like, you almost become like, I don't  want to be friends with anybody because you don't want to get too attached.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The good thing is that the business has changed now.  So it's really, I mean, it's almost, if you're like, I kind of came in right in between old  and new.  So I had that crazy side, but never got into the real serious stuff.  Yeah.  But now guys are, they play video games and, and guitar hero and, you know, they don't  do anything.  And it's like, you guys are really lame now, but it's, you know, you swung to the really 
[02:05:00]  lame.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Was it the schedule you guys had to keep?  I just think it was just the way it was.  If you look at guys in the eighties or, you know, even rock bands, seventies, eighties,  you know, they're all crazy nineties bands now aren't doing the same thing as crazy.  We talk about that because we've been around long enough now where we were backstage seeing  all these bands party and like just out of their minds.  And now they're like, you know, juicing, literally juicing carrots and fucking apple juice and 
[02:05:30]  having a salad.  And it's like, who are these guys?  They're supposed to be rock stars.  But, you know, Zach and I, when we first met, it was nuts.  I mean, we used to, we used to get loaded and then go play a pedestrian, pedestrian chicken  where you would lie in the middle of the street in like, you know, in, in downtown Manhattan  at like four in the morning and just lie there.  And it's like, well, nobody's going to run you over and just see if cars would come.  Like you'd be that, that fucking loaded where you're just going to lie in the street.  I dare someone to run me over.  Like that's smart, right?  Now, the last time, a couple of times we've hung out, you know, we're drinking tea and 
[02:06:00]  it's like a Zach's totally straight now.  And so you don't want to drink in front of him.  And as you move on in life, if you're lucky enough to get past that stuff and still be  alive, you have to kind of really appreciate that and not fuck around with it.  You know, great songs were almost not written.  How many fucking riffs would have been missed?  Pedestrian chicken.  One shitty cab could have ended a lot of great riffs without it depressing.  Are you a big Beatles fan?  A huge Beatles fan.  They're my favorite band.  You're writing, I read, dragged a chrome across my head like you're talking. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I woke up, got out of bed and dragged a chrome across my head.  And you refer to your mom as Sweet Loretta Modern.  That's obviously from the...  Yeah, and it's funny.  I always thought that was the lyric, but it's actually Sweet Loretta Martin, which I found  out just writing this book, but it'll always be Sweet Loretta Modern to me.  I thought it was Modern to me.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought that too.  What's your favorite Beatles song?  Probably, I'm pretty bad because I'm really with the obscure stuff.  I love I Want You, She's So Heavy from Abbey Road.  I can put that on and just, I think that's one of the first heavy metal songs of all time.  You know, I also used to also have a show on the Boneyard, which Jimmy does now. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, you were.  Very good.  I had it for two years.  And I used to get in trouble for playing the heavy Beatles or heavy Black Crows.  And now they play those songs, but I actually got fired because of that.  That and I called Oprah fat.  You're fired for that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't call Oprah fat.  She's the cash cow.  And I was like, choose your words wisely.  But yeah, because they wanted me to just do all, you know, they were really going through  this.  It was a hairband channel. 
[02:07:30]  It wasn't when I was hired.  It was just a heavy metal channel.  But see, from the other side, if you're a listener and Chris Jericho is playing like  his music, you want to know what Chris Jericho's into.  Who gives a fuck if maybe one or two are borderline not hairbands?  And at the end, I wasn't hired to do that logic.  Because they're sort of doing that to Jimmy a little bit.  Right, Jimmy?  We've had some.  I like your show, so I remember your show.  I remember your show, and I liked it.  But Jimmy's got a lot of fans, and now they're listening to the Boneyard going, wow, what  does Jimmy consider music in this sort of genre? 
[02:08:00]  That's right.  And it's fine to go completely off the playlist.  Because to me, it was a metal show.  So there was metal in the 60s.  You know, Sabbath, but the precursor to Sabbath was some of that heavy Beatles stuff.  And, you know, if you'll want to play any way you want it by Journey, that's just as  heavy as anything Poison has ever done.  But, you know, they got really strict about that because there was, you know, you know how  it is, program directors change.  Yeah.  But, I mean, I'm actually envious of your show because I love doing that.  It's the one thing in my career when I got tanked.  I was like, fuck.  Yeah, they're like that, man.  It was fun.  Yeah, program directors, they're just trying to justify their jobs because they're useless. 
[02:08:30]  Well, yeah.  And you know how this business goes, man?  They're completely useless.  They're jaded, too.  Like, as a listener, I know when I don't hear something that's a little different and go,  turn the station off.  I mean, I'll listen to it.  I don't panic if it's like something.  Check it out, right?  Especially if it's a personality like yourself or Chris Jericho.  If you're a fan of the guy, you're going to check it out because you trust his judgment.  Check this out.  I think you'll like it.  And you were bringing in a lot of listeners because it's Chris Jericho.  I think I did.  You know, I had the show for two years straight.  Not even a question.  There's no doubt in my mind.  It was fun, man. 
[02:09:00]  But the book looks, anything else you want to say about the book?  I would love to just read chapter titles and have you talk.  I don't want to give away the whole fucking book.  Jimmy's reading a chapter called MC Hammered.  And this is after 9-1-1.  I was on a plane from L.A. to Philly.  I was on a red eye.  And you know, red eyes are the shits.  You're trying to sleep, but you can't really.  And the sun is coming up.  So I was just about to go to sleep.  And I heard this voice, man.  I'm going, Ray!  Ray, this is stupid!  And it's like, what the hell is that? 
[02:09:30]  So I'm looking back and there's some businessman in the aisle seat,  still like kind of in the first few rows.  He's just fucking loaded.  And he's belligerent.  So he's yelling like,  Why are we landing?  We've got to land.  So I said to the stewardess, I was like,  Can you cut him off?  She goes, Sir, he's been cut off a couple hours ago.  So you just, you know, kind of mind your own business.  I'm like, what the fuck is with this bitch?  So the guy keeps going.  He's like, stupid plane.  So I finally get up and I go into his face. 
[02:10:00]  I said, listen, people are trying to sleep.  I'm sick of hearing your whiny voice.  Please shut the fuck up, please.  The stewardess taps me on the shoulder.  Sir, you're going to have to sit down.  You're making a disturbance.  I'm like, I'm making a disturbance?  What the fuck is with this chick?  So we finally land and now I'm really grumpy.  And we stop on the tarmac and it's raining.  And the guy's like,  I got to get off this fucking plane!  I got to get off this plane!  They sound like Tony Clifton.  Get off this plane!  So we finally stand up.  I tell the guy, you know,  there's kids on this flight.  Stop swearing.  Stop being an idiot.  And other passengers are like clapping. 
[02:10:30]  Like finally someone says something.  And this is after 9-1-1.  Like, you're not going to do something with this guy?  So as I'm walking off the plane,  the store is like,  sir, you really need to have an attitude check.  And I'm like,  what the fuck is with this?  Did she have like a mile high club experience?  Anyways, I go to the bathroom.  I go to take a leak.  I look beside me.  And MC Hammered, as I call him,  is pissing.  He just comes and puts his briefcase down  and starts pissing right beside me  and has no idea that I'm the guy  that was talking to him.  So I just look over  and I see his briefcase on the floor 
[02:11:00]  and I'm peeing.  And I was like,  oh, fuck it.  So I take a little bit of a quarter turn.  Take a turn?  I just peed all into his briefcase there.  And then I said,  you have a nice day, bud.  That was fine.  Yes.  Revenge.  Nice.  Sweet revenge.  How great is it to be big, though,  to just be able to walk up  with a guy who really is belligerent  on a plane  and just go,  shut the fuck up.  God, I would love to do that.  That movie theater  is where you can just turn around  and go, shut up.  Right.  But that was a crazy time around there,  though, man,  to have a guy yelling  and screaming like that. 
[02:11:30]  And I had to fly  three days after 9-1-1  because we had to do a show  in Memphis after that.  And, you know,  that was just to be there  and see, like, you know,  if, fuck,  someone's going to hit  the rest of the cockpit.  And I always wondered,  imagine what would happen  if one of those planes  had all the WWE wrestlers on it  when they were attacked.  You're talking about  fucking the craziest  motherfuckers on the planet  against a couple skinny  jihad guys with box cutters.  Fuck, man.  I used box cutters  to cut my forehead every night.  Cut your own head, yeah.  Cut your own head open.  Bring it on.  How many times  did you cut yourself in the ring? 
[02:12:00]  You don't have the scars  like some of the other guys, man.  Yeah, I didn't.  I mean, maybe a dozen times.  Not too much.  But, you know,  you find your places up.  The worst scars I have  are car accidents that I had  or things that are just,  you know,  fucking stupid shit  like falling into a wall  or something.  Drunk, being drunk.  Drunk a couple.  Who was the guy we saw  down at one of the fucking cons?  One of the guys  one of the Bushwhackers,  was it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like a road map.  Oh, my God.  It was unbelievable.  His fucking head  is so cut up.  The worst is Abdul the Butcher, 
[02:12:30]  if you've ever seen him.  Abdul the Butcher?  Not only is it so cut up,  they're deep.  You could put dimes in them  and just leave them.  They're like furrows.  Like little canyons  on his forehead.  That is fucked, man.  We got one of the biggest  wrestling guys.  Sam, you haven't said anything.  Yeah, you know Sam.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  Every wrestler knows Sam.  You got a question for Jericho  that we haven't covered?  Yes, as a matter of time.  Something that might make  all the blogs?  The wrestling blogs?  Oh, now that's a lot of pressure.  What a radio voice, too.  Yes, I have a little  question for you.  It's a character voice.  It's your gimmick? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, exactly.  He uses it all the time, though.  It's like the prestige.  It's like Moongoose.  He lives it.  A character called Homo.  So, Booker T came back  to do play-by-play.  Mick Foley did play-by-play.  Is that something,  you know, you're 40 now,  you left,  I mean, you can obviously  still go.  You left still able  to be at the top,  but could you see yourself  at some point coming back  into the company to do commentary?  I mean, it's something  that I would maybe consider,  but I have a pretty big ego, 
[02:13:30]  so I don't know if I can handle  not being in the spotlight,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  But I think I could do it.  I mean, it's definitely  an art form that you have to do it.  But you do have to put up  with Vince being in your headset.  We didn't know that  until Mick Foley told us.  Yeah, but I mean,  just don't worry about it.  I mean, Vince is,  like I said,  he forgets what he says,  you know,  if he says something,  oh, you fucking idiot,  and then five seconds later  doesn't even remember he said it.  What a great job!  I just feel like  that's exactly right.  Like a Chris Jericho,  Sam Roberts sort of  play-by-play team.  There you go.  It could be something  Vince was into. 
[02:14:00]  For like gay porn or something.  We'll go to live sex shows  in TJ  and commentate them together.  That would work.  That'd be something  I'm interested in.  Absolutely.  When Jim was talking about it,  Vince McMahon  says when you're doing  something wrong,  my favorite part of your book  so far that I've read  is when you're telling  the story of Vince  telling you how badly you did,  and then when he says,  from now on,  every match you have,  he has to run through X-Pac  because he knows  how to work a match  and you don't.  Oh, shit! 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I had to.  Oh, wow.  That was like the real...  Bret Hart told me  Vince likes to...  He's like a drill sergeant.  He likes to tear you down  and build you back up again  in the way that he wants you to be.  And one of the things  I had to do  was go over all my matches  with this guy, X-Pac,  which was...  You know,  I had to swallow  a lot of pride.  Like I said,  around that three,  four, five-week period,  I could have just went,  I fucked this,  I quit, I quit,  but I just wouldn't  allow myself to do that.  You know,  I just couldn't allow  that dream for nine years  to just piss it away.  There, now make it work. 
[02:15:00]  Make it work.  So I swallowed a lot of pride  and swallowed a lot of crow  and did what I was told  and then, you know,  a couple months later  they moved on to somebody else  and that was the end of it,  but it was a real  initiation period.  You were the whipping boy  for a while, yeah.  I was,  a big target on my back  for sure.  How do you go over a match?  Do you tell him  I'm going to do this  and he's going to do that  or do you actually  physically have to show him  or are you just talking about him?  You talk about a few things,  but it's a lot like improv  in improv comedy.  You just kind of battle  back and forth  and listen to what the crowd  is doing.  It's either really brilliant 
[02:15:30]  or hideously embarrassing  to watch one or the other.  Were you a groundling?  I was a groundling, yeah.  That's a really prestigious  improv group.  Yeah.  A lot of funny people  have come out of the groundlings.  Oh, fuck yeah.  But it's funny,  like you said,  when I first started doing it,  this guy called Michael Hitchcock  was kind of the teacher for me  and he said,  listen, we're doing it,  it was called  the Phil Hartman Theater.  He said,  there's 99 people in this place.  If you kill it,  there's 99 people to see it.  If you bomb,  there's 99 people to see it.  Who gives a fuck?  And that's basically the attitude.  You know,  it's either really brilliant  or just the shits.  But what it did do 
[02:16:00]  is it really helped me  with wrestling  because to really  believe in what you're doing,  what's the word I'm looking for  when you're really getting to it?  Commit.  Sorry,  what an actor I am.  When you really commit to it  and that helped a lot,  you just got to go for it.  If you believe it  and if you have no doubt  that this is working,  then chances are  that's going to rub off  and it's going to work.  That's the same with comedy  or music or anything.  And it's got to make you  a little quicker  to think on your feet.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  Because we already  had to do that anyways.  Being in there with Rock  or Austin,  we did 20 minutes  of improv every night 
[02:16:30]  just going back and forth  talking shit.  So to be able to really  hone in on that  and sharpen it  was invaluable.  Do you ever get schooled  by somebody improv  like Chris Rock?  Non-wrestler I am.  Have you ever been  in one of those battles  back and forth  where the other guy  is just killing you  and you know,  he's outwitting me?  I was one of the few guys  that could keep up  with Rock and Steve  because they were  two of the best  and I actually got to the point  where I could feed them lines.  We were in Tokyo  and Rock and I worked  and there was 18,000,  20,000 people  and afterwards  Rock was doing his thing  and he used to do this thing 
[02:17:00]  where he'd say,  you know,  the Rock loves pie.  I love pie.  And then,  Jericho,  do you like pie?  And I would say,  I hate pie.  I love strudel.  I will eat strudel  all day long,  all night long.  And so Rock's like,  strudel?  He had that look,  you know,  you like strudel?  And I said to him,  I said to him,  call me Okama.  Whispering this,  you know,  underneath it,  Okama,  Okama,  just say it.  Okama means gay  in Japanese.  And so Rock's like,  so what are you,  Okama?  And the crowd was just like,  Okama,  the fact that Rock knew  what Okama was,  but I fell in the line, 
[02:17:30]  you know?  Eight,  ten years of credibility  in Japan,  pissed down the drain  in five seconds  just to get him over more.  Like,  he needed that.  That's great.  We're being told,  you have to go.  Ah,  shit!  You're a busy man.  It's up to you,  you stay if you want.  That's good,  busy man.  They're telling us  you got a lot of interviews.  Yeah,  man,  I've been doing tons of stuff.  That's very cool,  man.  That's great,  man.  I always love coming  and hanging out with you guys.  Like I said,  I appreciate the fact  not to get sappy.  You guys have supported  since 2000,  man,  so next book  we'll have a great story  with the Norton versus Jericho 
[02:18:00]  fight.  That was a good one.  And then our reconciliation  afterwards.  The best is you guys  brought in security.  We need some security in here.  It's like,  me and Jimmy  are going to get in a fight?  No,  it wouldn't be a fight.  We should have brought  in a mop for me.  No,  no,  no.  No,  no,  no.  He just came.  It's got to be on record  that that was Master Paul.  He just ran in.  He ran in.  Oh,  geez,  I know.  I must protect the talent.  I didn't want him in.  I was like,  come on,  dude,  what are you doing?  I knew we were fine, 
[02:18:30]  but Master Paul was doing his.  And then we kind of  started working it a bit.  At least I know that I was.  Yeah,  yeah,  definitely.  I did the same thing  with Mickey Rourke  on Larry King Live  when he did the wrestler.  I was actually going to have  a match with him  at WrestleMania,  but then he kind of  let the cat out of the bag.  His agents flipped out,  whatever.  So he went on Larry King  and I went on and Vince said,  you've got to try  and goad him into this match.  So I just said,  fuck,  I'm going full on asshole here.  And I was like,  I don't have respect for you.  You're a coward.  You're a son of a bitch.  And Mickey was just like,  okay,  I'll accept that.  And he could just see like, 
[02:19:00]  afterwards,  he was convinced  that I was serious,  convinced that I really wanted  to beat him up.  And when he finally came  to WrestleMania  to do a little bit,  he brought three UFC guys,  one of them being  Frank Shamrock,  some crazy looking Israeli  with tattoos.  He brought them with him  to beat me up  because that's how serious  he thought I was being.  And I had to explain,  Mickey,  I was just acting, man.  I'm just selling the show.  It took me 10 minutes  to convince him.  He's finally like,  seriously?  Before you go,  how about Brock?  You see Brock in MMA. 
[02:19:30]  How do you,  does that like make any  other guys want to go over there?  He's done so well.  Dude,  I mean,  you saw that right from the start.  He was,  he's so strong  and so agile  as a wrestler  and picked it up.  Like,  I've never seen anybody  pick up wrestling that quickly.  Like,  he was a natural for it.  So it's the same  with Ultimate Fighting.  So I have no doubt  that he'll be one of the  most dominant guys  there for years  because he's really smart.  And also,  too,  I'm not saying this in a bad way,  you know guys from like the farm,  you know,  like he's from South Dakota,  I think.  Not saying he's stupid,  but he's simple. 
[02:20:00]  So it's like,  you know,  it's one of those type of guys  you see like a cat  in the farm yard  that's kind of hurt.  You just go and break its neck  and he's that guy.  Yeah.  He has no problem.  Just like,  oh,  there's a mouse.  Anyways.  Did you know what was going on  between,  what was it,  The Undertaker?  Yeah.  And Brock  with that little back and forth shit?  I'm sure they probably  were just putting out  some feelers  to see if they could do something  for WrestleMania.  Oh,  really?  You don't think it's a real problem there?  I don't really know,  but I would say probably not.  But you never know.  That was just such a weird.  The weird time  because you just lost  the heavyweight championship 
[02:20:30]  to Kane.  Didn't seem like you wanted to.  Really weird.  Yeah,  that's like a real time  that you're feeling pretty bad  as you walk out of the room.  No one has really explained that  since that happened.  She's begging.  She's begging.  That's hilarious.  That just means  we love hanging out  with Chris Jerick.  The new book is called  Undisputed.  Thanks,  Chris,  man.  Thank you very much,  guys.  We'll see you next time.  Today at noon,  tonight at,  Today at noon,  Borders on Broadway.  Today,  8 o'clock at the,  Speaking at a Book Signing  in Huntington,  New York  at the Book Review  and then tomorrow 
[02:21:00]  in Boston,  for you Boston fans,  Barnes & Noble College,  Boston University Bookstore  and that's at 7 p.m.  You get to meet Chris  and get your book signing.  He's going to have a shit  a lot of people.  Thank you, guys.  Chris Jericko.  Thanks, Chris.  Hello,  you guys.  Rob?  Yeah,  who's this?  I don't think I've ever laughed  as hard at anything in my life.  Get in touch with the  Opie Anthony Show.  Call 866-1011.  That's 866-969-1969.  Hey,  really fast.  The Twitter exploding, 
[02:21:30]  the instant feedback exploding.  There's something wrong  with the online player,  so I just want to acknowledge  that I'm getting your feedback  on that.  I don't know.  People are really,  really frustrated  because they're trying to  listen to the show online  and there's way too many  coming in,  so,  you know,  I don't know what they could  do down the hall,  but there's obviously  some kind of issue.  What it is,  I don't know.  It's not my expertise.  I do not know.  But they just want to listen  to the show online  and they're finding it  very tough to do.  Okay? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  So,  will that even get  to the guys down the hall?  Type,  type,  type.  All right.  Enough.  I, you know,  just want to get that out there  for the people.  They care that much  to write us about.  We should acknowledge that  and try to see  if there's anything  that could be done  for the people out there.  Hey,  did you watch the Watson?  No,  I've heard about the Watson.  I watched a little.  Didn't watch the Watson. 
[02:22:30]  I watched a little  of the Watson.  Heard of the Watson?  Didn't watch the Watson.  Suspicious.  Who's picking the fucking  questions for the Watson?  Is someone manually  picking at least the questions?  I have no idea  how it works.  Do you have an expert  on the Watson?  I don't know how it works.  Meaning someone that just  knows more than us  and then you're  officially an expert.  What do you think  of this whole thing?  I think,  from what I've heard,  the second the question  comes up,  the computer knows 
[02:23:00]  what it is.  So instead of Alex Trebek  having to read it  like he does to the people,  the second it comes up,  the computer knows  instantly what it is.  But then based on  whether the computer,  the percentage,  whether it thinks  it knows the answer or not,  that dictates  how long  it's going to take  the computer  to buzz in.  See,  because there's that  buzz in factor.  Right, right.  Now that to me  is handicapping  the machine.  Because as a computer,  the computer  could probably  buzz in instantly 
[02:23:30]  the second the question  comes up  and more times  than not get  the answer right  and win the game  and shut everybody else out.  So the computer wins.  But there's no  handicapping the machine  because he's kicking ass  so far, isn't he?  Well, that's what I mean.  Even a handicapped machine  is kicking ass.  Oh, so you're saying  It would be a bloodbath.  Hands down,  fuck everyone  if they just let it  actually be a computer  where it doesn't  have to read it.  The second the question  comes up,  it calculates so fast  that you don't even  get done reading 
[02:24:00]  the question  before it already  has the answer.  I'm not impressed.  I'm not impressed.  Because the computer  was built specifically  to kick ass in Jeopardy.  Not impressed.  I thought it was  just a regular computer  they put up there.  Is that it?  You just thought  it was like a fucking  a Dell?  Yeah, they just put  a Dell laptop up there.  Right.  We named our  Dell computer Watson  and look what  this thing could do.  Then I would be impressed.  But supposedly, what,  hundreds of programmers  for I think  five years or something? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  With the main goal  of just beating Jeopardy.  Not impressed.  Not impressed.  Nah.  No.  I want to see  what my Mac could do.  I want to put it  in one of the positions  up against Watson.  You just want to put  your Mac against Watson?  And that bore Ken Jennings.  Enough about Ken Jennings.  People seem to like him.  No, they don't.  I don't know what that's all about.  Do they really like Ken Jennings?  Maybe a few nerds do.  A few nerds?  Nerds.  Let me say hi to Kyle  in New Mexico, 
[02:25:00]  the official expert  on the Watson.  Kyle, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Basically, how it works  is once it gets to a question,  it has thousands  of encyclopedias  encyclopedias  and medical  and physics research papers  that it first queries  and then takes  what it thinks  the question is asking  and it searches  on the internet  for some of the keywords.  Yeah.  It has an answer  and now puts the answer  into the question.  There's another search  on the internet  to see how many hits  come back.  Sorry. 
[02:25:30]  That helps give it  a probability  if it's the right answer  or not.  Okay, so  they named the computer  the Watson  and they should be  naming it Google.  Yeah, it just Googles.  It Googles the answer?  Is that what's happening?  That's not impressive.  Anyone could Google.  Let Ken Jennings Google.  When they were developing it,  they let some of the people  that work at IBM  could go sit in the audience  and watch the machine  and it would give  the top ten answers  that it thought.  And if it gets over  a certain percentage, 
[02:26:00]  then it buzzes in  and answers with it.  But a lot of times  it gets things wrong.  The cool thing about it  is that it knows wordplay.  It understands, like,  the multiple meanings  from different words  because lots of the  Jeopardy questions  are written all fucked up.  Yeah, they're written, like,  in that stupid  answer question form  and sometimes  it's like a pun.  So it understands, like,  puns and things.  That's pretty impressive.  But why...  I guess you explain  why we should be impressed, huh?  Well, what they want  to do with it is  they made the program 
[02:26:30]  that played chess  and everyone, like,  watched it  and got interested  but they could sell it.  No one wanted  a chess-playing computer  for their corporation.  So what they're doing  with this is  they're trying to sell it  to, say, a law firm,  for example,  so someone could ask  the computer,  I'm looking for a case law  and reference  DWI stops  in Abercrombie  involving red trucks.  And the computer  can basically understand  the question  better than just  a regular Google search  could  and more intelligently  give answers.  And that's how 
[02:27:00]  they're trying to  market this computer  to sell it to Google.  But doesn't it seem  very close to Google?  Well, it does use  an internet search  that queried databases  and just general answers  and that's how  it helps with that.  So all I need to know  because this is what  scares the shit  out of all of us,  Watson is not aware.  It's not aware.  Become aware.  It's not...  Okay, good.  That's all I care about.  Fine.  No, no, no.  Thank Google away, Watson.  Have fun.  Have fun with the Jeopardy.  Whatever you want to do. 
[02:27:30]  Whatever you want to do.  Is Watson actually  winning those games?  I think so.  It's worth watching  for five minutes  because Alex Trebek  is such a fucking bore.  Even with this.  You don't like the way  he pronounces everything  like a Canadian?  I can't even have fun  with this.  No, the answer is  Montreux.  Like, I thought  it would be fun  and a few other people  made this observation  as well.  Make the computer  sound like Sean Connery.  What's it sound like?  From the old, you know,  SNL, you know, 
[02:28:00]  sketches.  Yeah, yeah.  Have a little fun with it.  Or every once in a while  have it come out.  Call his mother a whore?  Yes.  Well, maybe not go that far  because you've got to keep it  Mother's a whore, Trebek.  You've got to keep it, you know,  highbrow because it's Jeopardy.  Yeah.  But you can have fun  even though something's highbrow.  Oh, yeah.  Look, it's answering.  What is Toronto?  Someone is saying  that Watson is not hooked up  to the internet, though.  No.  It's all just self-contained.  What was the question  for that one?  Oh.  What rhymes with Momento? 
[02:28:30]  And this in Canada.  I think we got some Watson audio.  Let's take a listen to this.  See what this is about.  Oh, this is good.  This is actually a good clip.  Watson,  computer proves he's stupid  during Final Jeopardy.  Oh, really?  Final Jeopardy category  is UF.  Category.  Category.  Category.  Category.  Category.  All right.  A category.  You're great at pronouncing stuff.  He really is.  Terrific.  Category.  Yes. 
[02:29:00]  I shouldn't make fun of him  because he ended up marrying  like a friend of the family.  Did he?  Swear to God.  Is she hot?  I don't even know  if they're together.  I was going to say,  is he hot?  This is...  You know,  I was implying...  Is he a fruit?  No.  He lived with his mommy  for a long time, though.  Did he?  Yeah.  I was...  That's kind of weird.  I was friends...  I was friends with his wife's son  who had the misfortune  of having his skull drilled into  every six months  to relieve liquids. 
[02:29:30]  Ah.  What is water on the brain?  Wow.  Ah.  The guy's no longer with us, either.  He died in a fine car accident  because I think his condition  might have caused him  to swerve off the road.  What is six feet under?  Yeah, there you go.  But she was beautiful.  She lived right down the street  from us in Centerport.  Same bus and everything.  My brother knew her  way more than I did.  I knew her brother.  But what does this mean?  Who gives a fuck?  Who really gives a fuck? 
[02:30:00]  I'm trying to, like,  fucking make it look like  I know Hollywood.  Who cares?  Yeah, you're in.  Well, you had a connection  to Alex Trebek.  I haven't seen or talked to her  in probably fucking 30 years.  Yeah, but you knew someone  Who gives a fuck?  Who had a kid with a hole in the head  and cheap mallet, whatever?  But here's Watson being stupid.  Final Jeopardy category  is U.S. Cities  and here is the clue.  Its largest airport  is named for a World War II hero. 
[02:30:30]  Its second largest  for a World War II battle.  30 seconds, players.  Good luck.  We come to you, Ken.  You had 2,400  for this final going in  and you wrote down  what is Chicago.  That is correct.  And you wagered  $2,400.  That doubles your score.  4,800.  Down to Brad now.  He had 5,400.  I have to feel that  he came up with a correct response. 
[02:31:00]  Did he?  Yes.  And the wager?  Doing almost everything you can.  5,000 dollars  takes you up to 10,400.  Now to our leader, Watson.  Going in the finals,  36,681.  And the response was  what is Toronto?  With a lot of question marks  which means, of course,  that Watson had  many, many doubts.  And the wager?  How much are you going to lose?  Oh, you sneak.  $947.  So, it wound up winning 
[02:31:30]  because it didn't bet  the load.  Well, a computer can figure out  the math shit  easy enough, right?  Yeah.  And everyone's saying  the computer is self-contained.  That's what makes us  impressive, I guess.  That it's not reaching out  to other computers  and the internets.  Which would be funny  because it doesn't matter  what the question is.  Porn would come out.  If it was on the internet,  just porno would come out.  Ah, no, I'm sorry.  Watson has answered, 
[02:32:00]  what is meat spin?  And as we see  the dick spinning around,  we know this is not correct, Watson.  It would just take  one lousy porn virus  and Watson is fucked.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  What is lemon party  is the wrong answer.  Wrong answer.  Going two girls, one cup.  Oh, yeah.  What is two girls, one cup?  Yes, that is correct, though.  Yes, that is correct.  What do I jerk off to  on a nightly basis  in Quebec? 
[02:32:30]  Canadian.  Let me say hi to  Alex Trebek.  Daniel, I hope to a home of him.  Daniel, is this you?  Yep.  You got me.  Are you the one  with the girl's name  that calls from time to time?  Don't believe so.  It's Daniel, right?  Yeah, Daniel.  Okay, sometimes we get a Danielle  and we laugh openly  because it's a guy.  Oh, nope.  But that's not you.  Girl named girl.  It's not him, though.  But there is a guy  that does calls.  All right, whatever.  What do you got  on the Watson?  Yeah, that first guy 
[02:33:00]  had most of his facts right  except for the internet thing.  It's not hooked  to the internet.  Oh, okay.  So I thought you had...  Were we just saying that?  Yeah, I thought you had  something else besides that.  No?  No?  Well, that and the fact  that they made a computer  that can understand a pun  which is, you know, amazing  and, like, you know,  human language  which is kind of complicated  sometimes and they just  think they nailed it.  As being the Watson expert,  I need to know this.  Is he picking the questions?  I heard that there's  some human interaction  going on.  I don't believe so.  What they've said  on many of the videos 
[02:33:30]  that I've watched  is that once they set it up  and hit go,  it's on its own.  They can't interact with it.  Why not just pull  the goddamn plug?  Yeah, the whopper.  The whopper.  If it wins a question  then it picks its own  and, you know,  it does all by itself.  I guess that's all  we have on the Watson.  I think it was cool  that they did it  on Valentine's Day  when anybody who gave a shit  about robots or Jeopardy  was home to watch.  That's a good line.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man. 
[02:34:00]  I don't know.  It just seems to me...  It was worth checking out.  Yeah, very gimmicky.  Kind of cool.  Jeopardy some huge ratings  for the next few days, right?  Jeopardy does that  every so often.  They get like...  When they had either one  of these two champions  on there,  that's amazing in itself.  They, I think,  earned something like...  Was it combined?  Five million dollars?  Yeah, the one guy  won over, I don't know,  Brad or something?  Yeah, like, what was it?  70 games in a row?  Over 70 games in a row?  Well, Ken Jennings  won the most games in a row.  Yeah.  The other guy won  the most money, I believe.  Most money. 
[02:34:30]  And I think the guy  winning the most money,  it's over three million.  It's crazy.  And then Ken must have  pushed about two million.  Yeah.  In his run, I guess.  So...  That's something.  And then the computer,  which I guess  doesn't get any money, huh?  Yeah.  What does it do?  What?  Just so...  Is it when oil is something?  Right?  When oil is something.  Yeah, the computer wins  a bunch of new buttons.  Here's your wires  or something.  You know what  the computer's like.  Hey, new table  to stand on all day. 
[02:35:00]  New card table  for a computer.  What do computers want?  What do you win?  A bunch of money?  I'm not going to buy with it.  New bag to get carried around in.  Jesus.  Chip's funny today.  Yeah.  It's kind of funny  buying a new card table.  What are you doing, Chip?  You're being funny.  I'm very funny.  Not really.  I know what the computer wants.  Computers are going to want  like a new apartment.  Why?  It's being... 
[02:35:30]  Huh?  Chip just blows it.  He can't handle the...  He can't handle the pressure  actually being funny.  Eh, well.  I want to give an example  of what we deal with  on a regular basis.  All right.  Andrew on Long Island.  What's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, how's it going?  Better now, bud.  Thanks a million.  What do you got  as far as Watson and Jeopardy goes?  Outstanding.  Well, he answered Toronto  when they asked for a U.S. city.  Really?  When did that happen? 
[02:36:00]  I don't know.  Last night?  Really?  Oh.  They asked for a U.S. city  and it said Toronto?  Oh.  How many question marks  were after Toronto?  A lot.  Really?  And what did that mean?  Yeah.  All right.  I love when someone realizes...  Defeat is great.  I love it.  The sound of defeat...  So is Dion's.  Ah, Chip.  I'm on a roll of something.  You really are. 
[02:36:30]  A buttered roll.  I get it?  No.  Hey, Chip.  That is very funny.  Holy fuck.  All right.  We got some other stuff.  Ooh.  What do you got?  That's a pretty purple case.  Well, this is the...  We played it yesterday, obviously.  The news reporter  speaking a new language.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Is there an update on her?  It turns out  that she didn't have a stroke.  She's just going for tests. 
[02:37:00]  But she feels fine  and everything's fine.  I think she just  completely panicked.  You know what?  Really?  But she's been a reporter  for...  You know, she was...  Look, I'm doing it now.  No, she's...  It's not like  it was her first detail.  No, but you ever  just been moist mouth  like, you know,  all of a sudden  and if it's like that.  Yeah, but that was a...  Yeah, she didn't even come close.  I forgot to...  Is Sam down the hall?  I tweeted one yesterday.  There's another one  that happened a while ago  that's pretty bad, too. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  Talking about Obama's health care.  Yeah?  Oh, right.  So that's about a year ago.  Was it Obama?  Actually trying to make it make sense?  Obama might have cursed yesterday.  Yeah, I heard that.  That's pretty funny.  Just get word to Sam.  It was on my Twitter  yesterday afternoon.  It was a pretty good one  worth playing today.  Sam, Sam,  there's a problem  only you can solve.  There you go.  Just like the mush mouth  one from after the Grammys.  Here's Obama cursing, I guess.  I don't...  You know,  it was a little slippery.  Yeah, it's a little slippery.  But everyone making a big deal about it. 
[02:38:00]  It's always funny to hear  President kind of curse.  which would cut the deficit  by more than $400 billion  over the next decade  and bring annual domestic spending  to its lowest share of the economy  since Dwight Eisenhower.  It's lowest shit.  This is fun.  It is funny.  It's just fun for everybody.  It's lowest shit.  Ah.  But then they really got to spin it  and say,  he really meant to say shit.  It's not like he said  lowest cunt  or lowest fuckwad.  Yeah, there's really nothing to spin. 
[02:38:30]  No.  He just said the word shit by mistake.  I know.  That's it.  Even I can't find something  to fault him on on that.  I'm sure Rush Limbaugh will.  The president said shit.  If you noticed what he said there,  it was cursing.  Yeah.  Is that the man we want?  And then Glenn Beck  will use his blackboard  to fucking explain  what that means.  I never saw Glenn Beck.  He'll write the word shit  and then write words off of it. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  It means that Obama's in  on the fact that  the whole world's going to be Islamic  within the next 10 years.  He's obviously a Muslim extremist.  Yeah.  Glenn Beck, wow.  I mean, I watch him occasionally  because it is...  I watch all of them.  It is just so fun  to watch a man  just become unglued.  Have you just seen him  wearing the robe the other day?  No.  Oh, no.  Why is Fox putting up with this?  Because they know people watch it.  Just because of the ratings, right?  But I think they're watching... 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, I think a lot of people  are watching now.  Like, people watch Hannity.  And Hannity has...  It's a conservative show,  obviously.  He goes on there.  He's very well educated  on what's going on.  He has his own opinions,  which are very Christian,  very right-wing, whatever.  Whether you agree with him or not,  it's a very prepared show that...  I'll say it,  because I'm not...  I don't agree with you on Hannity,  but he seems the most sane 
[02:40:00]  is what you're getting at.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Glenn Beck's...  He's educated and...  Glenn Beck might have  the best info ever,  but he sounds and looks like  a lunatic at this point.  He really is coming off  like a man unhinged  that, honestly,  I would act like that  if Muslim paratroopers  were coming out of a plane  over my head.  I would start going,  holy shit!  Right.  Like, he's acting like that  right now.  Right, right.  His presentation's  a little strange.  With the blackboard  and he's wearing a robe 
[02:40:30]  now at times.  Yeah, yeah.  If it all comes to fruition  and he was right,  we could all say,  goddamn, Glenn Beck  was right.  We should have listened.  Oh, my God.  He was amazing  and so...  He had such foresight.  Watch out, man.  The Glenn Beck fans  are calling.  But right now...  I'm just saying,  he might have the best info,  but his presentation's  a little kooky.  Right now,  he's just coming off  as a little kooky.  A little kooky.  I've said over the years  I'm not a politics guy,  but I'm watching all of them 
[02:41:00]  every fucking night now.  Every fucking night.  Oh, they're great.  I can't get enough.  Because then you've got  the pompous Bill O'Reilly  who can't do no wrong.  Bill O'Reilly.  And everyone should kiss his ass  the no-spin zone.  He even proved  he knows more than Obama.  Of course he does.  And you'll learn more  if you buy some of his  coffee cups, hats, shirts,  fucking bibs.  Pinhead or Patriot.  Pinhead or Patriot.  Pinhead or Patriot pins.  Fucking asshole.  What else does he hawk?  Is Tiger Woods  a pinhead or a Patriot?  What? 
[02:41:30]  No, he's a nice guy.  Right.  He's a load machine.  He's a cum dispenser.  He's a good man.  And then I've been watching  Keith Overman's replacement,  Lawrence O'Donnell,  and now he's calling out O'Reilly.  He basically wants to fight him  on the street.  It's like...  It's radio.  It's shock jock morning radio.  It's like radio wars  that we went through.  What?  When was the big period  for radio wars?  The late 90s?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We did well in the mid-90s, too.  Mid, late 90s. 
[02:42:00]  I'd say mid-90s to...  Yeah.  Radio wars at this point  are almost silly.  Everyone was just like...  Yeah!  And that's what these guys  are doing.  They're doing radio wars.  Radio wars, yeah.  I was watching Lawrence O'Donnell  lose his mind the other night.  He's calling out O'Reilly,  calling him basically a punk  and a fake tough guy.  Punk?  Basically saying,  look, let's fucking fight  on the street.  Fight on the street?  He didn't officially say that.  But it's so funny  just to have people  that mad about what.  And he basically said,  and remember,  we used to use this tact 
[02:42:30]  with Howard and everyone else,  and if you don't respond to this,  it just proves how right I am.  He wants attention.  Oh, really?  Is that how it works?  Well, he needs the ratings,  so he needs Bill O'Reilly  to respond.  And we used to use that tact.  When we were the little guys,  we would go after the big guys  and basically say,  look, our whole philosophy was  we need the big guy  to talk about us.  Yeah.  So we got to go ugly, man.  And that's what happened.  And that's what they're now doing  with these shows on MSNBC.  They're all doing it.  Yeah.  They're all doing it.  Yeah, because if you could get 
[02:43:00]  the guy with the highest ratings  to talk about you,  that was what you needed.  Right.  So you would just keep  pounding and pounding.  And you know,  at the beginning,  they're just going,  well, I won't talk about him.  I won't talk about him.  And then after a while,  they just couldn't take it anymore.  If this is true,  I owe an apology.  Bill in Delaware.  O'Reilly's a dope, he says.  I don't know.  I don't think O'Reilly's a dope.  My problem with O'Reilly  is just so over-the-top pompous.  But I think he's a very smart guy.  100% of his merchandise profits  go to charity. 
[02:43:30]  I did not know that.  100%?  If that's true,  that's a good thing.  I don't know.  Okay, whatever.  So am I.  But, you know.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah?  Craigslist.  We got a Glenn Beck fan.  It's only fair.  Fair, excuse me.  Tom and Connecticut.  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey there, Tom.  You're out, Tom.  How are you, boys?  All right, Tom.  You know, Beck is a whack job,  but the fact that his ratings  are so through the roof,  I don't know if that's scary or not.  Well, it's not scary 
[02:44:00]  if you realize it's all just entertainment.  No, it's kind of fun for people to,  you know, watch and go like,  holy shit, what's he talking about?  I see a lot of these shows  are losing credibility  as the days go by,  not even the years or the months.  I mean, the credibility on these shows  are really, really just being  thrown out the window.  Yeah.  Look at the opposite.  Look at Olbermann,  who was a total jerk-off,  who had no fan base  and no ratings whatsoever,  and he was a total opposite effect,  and nobody watched him.  I don't like Keith Olbermann at all, 
[02:44:30]  but he had a fan base.  He did, but where...  Where did he go now?  He's going on...  But not near.  No, O'Reilly kicked his ass,  but he's going on current TV.  Okay.  Okay.  Conservative talk will always do better  than liberal talk.  It's just the way it is.  Right.  It's more compelling.  It's more exciting.  I think conservative talk  is talking to a more singular audience,  and I think liberal talk  is a much more factioned audience. 
[02:45:00]  You have...  Conservatives are basically  willing to listen to other conservatives,  regardless of your offshoot  of conservatism, you know?  Right.  Liberals, you have your guilty white people,  you have your tree-hugging environmentalists,  you have your community leaders,  and they might not all agree with each other,  and might not want to listen to another liberal  talk about his bullshit, or whatever.  But conservatives always seem to band together  to watch the people they want to watch. 
[02:45:30]  Well, that's primarily why Air America  went off the air.  Yeah.  They couldn't get it going.  They couldn't get anybody to listen to it.  Yeah, no shit.  The top talk shows in America  are all conservative talk.  Yeah, yeah.  All of them.  You got right at the top,  they list them every week  on one of these websites to go to,  and it's always Rush, Sean Hannity,  Glenn Beck is up there,  and then a bunch of the other guys,  I forget their names.  Mike Savage.  Mike...  Is he...  Yeah, and those guys are all  conservative talk show hosts, right? 
[02:46:00]  Where's the first position for the lefty?  Yeah.  Is there a lefty that makes the list?  Um...  I can't think of one.  That's how bad it is.  Jesse Busworth does okay.  Yeah.  Shut up.  You know what?  You got me.  I know, I know.  Because it sounded kind of like a radio name.  That sounded like...  I am so picking up on names Jimmy makes up.  He fucking got me, though.  Jesse Busworth?  He got me.  Busworth?  He got me. 
[02:46:30]  With you in the morning.  Jesse Busworth.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Well...  That's my radio name.  I'm changing my name.  I told you that.  Why, Jim?  Because I want to show up at his name.  What is it going to be?  Jerry Sherbert.  Jerry Sherbert?  That's my new name.  All right.  We'll look forward to that.  I want to...  Do you want to do comedy?  Mm.  I want to hear more from Rush,  because Jimmy got him down.  Rush will spin everything, man.  Well, that's exactly his gig.  He is the king of the spin. 
[02:47:00]  He's done that.  He is so...  I love these guys that are like,  oh, our country's doomed.  I wish the other guy would have won.  And that...  He doesn't wish.  They build their careers on the liberal winning.  Can I state the obvious?  Not only did Rush Limbaugh want Obama to fucking win the election,  he probably voted for him.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you just go in the voting booth and be like,  I need this guy to win, so I got a career?  Think about it.  Rush is probably thinking, you know what?  You never know, so I'm going to even go and vote for him. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't agree with his politics,  because someone will spin it out there in that way.  He made his huge career during the Clinton years.  Right.  And then during the Bush years, he pretty much just kind of...  There was sort of a drop-off.  Yeah, a big drop-off.  Not to the point where he was losing his career, but...  But he was talking about, you know,  I think he was talking about more House and Senate bullshit.  And then Obama comes in,  and he comes back with a vengeance.  He wants them.  He probably wants them for another four years.  Yeah, please. 
[02:48:00]  Not politically, because he doesn't agree with them,  but it's good for his business.  Oh, it certainly is.  Right?  Now everyone wants to talk about this.  Glenn Beck used to do Morning Zoo Radio.  We know that.  Did he?  I didn't know he did Zoo Radio.  He was a crew guy with a bad Coke problem.  Was that the...  See, that's why I made sure earlier.  You can't just say that.  I don't know.  But is it documented?  I know he's...  If it's documented, then that's another thing.  I know he's sober.  Is he sober?  Yeah, yeah, he's sober. 
[02:48:30]  This is John in North Carolina.  John, how do you know this?  Or is this something you just heard?  Because if it's something you just heard,  that's where we have problems.  Meow-o.  All right.  Meow-o.  No, I think it's documented that Glenn Beck did have problems,  substance abuse problems.  I don't know what they were,  but he's been sober now for a couple of years, I guess.  I'm not even sure when exactly.  Let's go to Rene.  Rene?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Ah, girl name, girl name. 
[02:49:00]  You have a girl name.  Well, I never heard that before.  You're good.  Hey, check this out.  Yes, sir.  Oh, do you remember that video, Glenn Beck?  That was the weird video where he was...  Morning Zoo one?  It looked like he was high.  Remember he was in bed?  Really?  Yeah, look at that picture right there.  That's him, yeah.  Yeah, you remember that picture where there's a video?  Google Glenn...  I thought you were showing Anthony a nice picture of his shit.  I swear, I went... 
[02:49:30]  His acting's getting good,  because I'm like, why is Anthony falling for this?  I rolled over there,  and I thought it was going to be him.  No, you remember there was footage of him  where he said he was on pills or something,  but he was for an operation?  Right.  Oh.  Hey, Rene disagrees with us.  Go ahead, Rene.  Hey, feel free to agree to disagree.  Go ahead.  What do you got there, Carol?  Go ahead.  Come on, Cynthia.  Two weeks ago,  Bob Kelly was in there,  and he was telling a story about his stepdad,  and he's told that story three times,  and you act like it was the first time you heard it.  Isn't that being fake, too? 
[02:50:00]  I mean, aren't...  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of...  You don't have to say anymore, I'll tell you.  There's a lot of stuff that is fake  with our show and other radio shows.  The thing is, when, like, Bob Kelly...  I'll take you inside a little bit.  When Bob Kelly tells a story we've heard a few times,  it's not our responsibility to say,  ah, we heard that one.  I assume, I can speak for myself,  there's a lot of people out there  hearing it for the first time,  so I'm allowing him to just kind of, you know,  tell it again. 
[02:50:30]  And you've never been with your drunken friends  at a bar or something,  and one of them starts telling a story  you've heard before,  and you just all kind of go,  yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But you're absolutely right.  What I try to do, though,  is like, okay, I know the story.  How can I possibly make it better  as he tells it again this time?  You know what I mean?  But my whole philosophy is  that he's telling so many more people  that story for the first time  than have heard it already.  It's not let's fool everyone  and try to make the people  that have heard this before  think that we're hearing it  for the first time. 
[02:51:00]  We're not trying to...  You know how many times, Ant?  It's fake.  And he can say the same thing about me.  He goes into a story,  and I look at it and I'm like,  oh, this one.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I know the exact role  I have to play in that story.  Yeah.  But also, sometimes the story  is funny more than once or two.  Don't forget.  That's true.  That's true.  So I've laughed at the same story twice.  I love hearing it again.  And you could remember little things  or other details that were there  that you don't remember  saying the first time.  And then sometimes when Ant tells a story,  I go, oh, you know what?  I'm glad he's telling this again  because the last time he told it,  I wish I would have asked him this question 
[02:51:30]  or let him in this direction.  And then it shoots off  to another, like, subject.  Right, right.  If she understands, I'm leaving now.  Bye-bye.  No, but you're right, though.  I mean, you're absolutely right  is what I'm saying.  All right, Becky.  Hey, take care, Joe.  No, that's a good one.  We'll set up by playing this  because this is...  It affects the life one.  Yeah, Jerry.  She likes to lick the you-know-whats.  What do you know-whats?  The Jews. 
[02:52:00]  Yes, sir.  Oberman had high ratings,  highest ratio on MSNBC.  MSNBC.  It's like having the biggest dick in China.  Oberman was the highest rated MSNBC personality  as well as cable news person  on any channel other than Fox.  There's a big drop-off after that  is what I'm saying.  And MSNBC,  the ratings for MSNBC suck.  You know what?  So if he's the highest rated guy  on the suckiest rated network, 
[02:52:30]  big whoop-dee-doo.  We can relate to that, though.  Yeah, exactly.  When we were syndicated,  that's how people spun our ratings at times.  Yeah.  When you want to be number one,  men 18 of 49,  is the big get,  as we like to say from time to time.  But a program director will go,  look, you're not number one,  men 18 of 49,  but men 22 to 27...  Oh, you're killing it.  ...that listen from  three in the afternoon  until 320...  Yeah.  ...you are number one, my friend.  Yeah, thanks.  They would try to build you up 
[02:53:00]  and go, look,  don't worry about it.  And that's, you know...  And we were number one  on stations that were abominations.  But Keith Olbermann  wanted to be number one  across the board.  Of course,  and he wasn't even close  to the Fox News ratings.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, we're going to get  to the Australian anchor as well.  But we set it up.  Everyone has seen  or heard this clip by now.  If not,  I would love to play this  and see how many people  are actually hearing this  for the first time.  I'd be very curious.  It's the lady reporter  out there in L.A.  after the Grammys.  What happened to that bitch? 
[02:53:30]  I heard she was all  mumbling and shit.  And for the people  that are sick of hearing that,  we do have a new one  that I'll turn a lot  of people on to today  that someone tweeted  me yesterday.  But first this.  First time, Serene.  Well, a very, very heavy  invitation tonight.  We had a very  darison fight.  Let's go ahead.  Terror's chasing  a little bit.  I had the pick.  We should not move on  from this clip.  This clip is just  fucking amazing.  That heavy bertation  is just getting me.  That's not good. 
[02:54:00]  That heavy bertation.  Yeah.  I go for more medium  bertation.  But you know what?  I don't like it too heavy.  It's too rich.  But bertation  should be a word.  Bertation.  How is bertation  not a word?  Every word has been  heavy bertation.  Bertation.  That guy?  No.  The fucking,  what was his name?  The guy who talked  a lot when he was on acid.  Heavy bertation.  The guy who was  fucked up.  With the cups?  Yeah.  We did this yesterday. 
[02:54:30]  Don't fix them.  Was it before you got here?  Yeah, I didn't remember that.  Oh, because I thought  you were losing your mind now.  No.  Yeah, Anthony did a whole  video of you.  I did a video of that.  Yeah, Anthony did a man.  Oh, I didn't even know.  I put a little video together.  Holy shit, I thought  you were just having a stroke.  No, I really didn't know.  Wasn't it here yesterday?  Having a stroke.  I forgot you got here late  because of the L.A. flight.  Yeah, we were in the L.A.  No, Anthony made a mashup  where it goes to the  drinking out of cups guy.  Yeah, the lizard.  Pretty funny video.  Heavy bertation.  But why is a bertation a word? 
[02:55:00]  It is actually.  Oh, what does it mean?  It's a combination of  it's a birthday invitation.  It's a bertation.  So you take a vacation  on your birthday.  Bertation.  All right, now it's a word.  It is.  Oh, we haven't even talked  about Billy Ray Cyrus.  Oh, he's freaking out.  We'll get to that.  We'll get to that.  Hannah Montana ruined his family.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  That's right.  And achy, breaky heart did what?  Oh, man.  Look at that, right?  You have to admit to people  that you are the achy, 
[02:55:30]  breaky heart guy.  Hannah ruined his family.  Look.  Because she's bigger than him.  He's probably jealous  and she's like,  shut up, Dad.  What is this about, Ed?  I mean, might as well do it.  His daughter is, you know,  there's that clip of her  smoking something out of a bong.  They're hinting her problems  are way worse than people know.  Like, she's barely holding  onto that public persona  of Hannah Montana and shit  by a thread right now.  By a thread.  Why blame it on Hannah Montana? 
[02:56:00]  Why not blame it on your  fucking parenting skills  to figure that shit out?  He actually does.  Because there was a time  where she had to  and would listen to you.  He does blame it on himself.  Now it's too fucking late.  He blames it on himself, too.  He took some of the blame for it.  He said that he,  looking back,  he never would have  even let her do that.  Bullshit.  I know.  The money that's fucking  raked in,  raked in,  and actually helped  his lousy career.  His career was dead  in the water.  Oh, I know.  Done.  And then he got to be  on that show with her.  And it made her a big star. 
[02:56:30]  She's going through  that time in her life  where she's a huge star.  She starts, you know,  feeling her oats  as a young woman.  And she's bigger than him?  Yeah.  She's bigger than him.  Way bigger than he ever was.  And she's starting  to experiment with the drugs  and sex  and just scantily clad.  Would you?  In a second!  There's not even any doubt!  Would you let her  suck your Peter?  Yes! 
[02:57:00]  Oh, of course I would!  Would you let her  suck the cunt?  Who wouldn't?  Yeah, would you let her  lick your pud?  There isn't one guy  that isn't a complete  flaming homosexual  that wouldn't do that.  Would you let her  lick your pud?  Look, come on.  Would you let her  put her fingers  in your ghoulie?  Um, only if I could  do the same.  Would you let her  make the motorboat sound  in your anus?  That would just be silly.  While she pulled  on your balls?  While she was  trying to start it.  That's so silly. 
[02:57:30]  So what is he talking about?  I love these guys  that talk after the fact.  Get the fuck out of here.  That Hannah Montana  was very good for you  and the family.  He's full of turkey.  Yes.  Now that the show  is pretty much over,  I would assume.  I don't know that world,  but I would assume it's...  What, Hannah Montana?  Way past his...  I think that's dead.  Is it dead or is it...  Okay.  No, I think that's done, right?  That's been done a while.  Completely done?  She's a little too old  for that.  I don't think Disney  wants her parading around 
[02:58:00]  half nude.  See, now it's easy  to say this stuff.  Then you should have  yanked her out.  I hate to say it,  but yes, I do.  Yeah, I take it back  in a second, he said.  For my family to be here  and just be everybody okay,  safe and sound,  and happy and normal  would have been fantastic.  Heck, yeah.  I'd erase it all  in a second if I could.  That's such bullshit  when these celebrities  say this.  She's dressing like a whore.  Then give the money back.  Yeah, give the money back.  Go ahead.  Give it to charity.  We said the same thing  to that dope man cow 
[02:58:30]  when he started  trashing shock jocks.  I'm like, really?  You were living in a mansion...  A turd?  You were living in a mansion  somewhere because you had  turd doing shock jock things  and you were doing  shock jock things?  Just give the money back  then if you regret it.  I'm turning my back  on the shock jock genre.  I'm doing a political talk  now, turd.  Turd?  What do you think  of Obama, turd?  Yeah, what happened?  We're going to drop  him in a voting booth.  We're dropping turd  into the ocean  for election day.  Jack off. 
[02:59:00]  He did the hackiest  shock jock shit  on the industry radio.  What is turd doing,  you think?  Turd?  We know man cow  is trying to do  the political thing.  Turd's running for  governor of Iowa.  Probably.  I don't know what  turd is up to.  The artist formerly  known as Turd.  Fucking ass.  Can we get an update  on turd there?  Turd?  Where's turd?  That's your job.  Homework assignment.  I want to know  what turd's doing.  Isn't he still on the show?  What show?  I know.  Oh, man cow?  Who knows?  If he is,  he's probably just  answering phones or something.  Man cow?  He's so off the radar. 
[02:59:30]  Like, so off the fucking radar.  I don't know.  There's a couple shows  that throw him on TV  every once in a while  to give his opinion.  Really?  Yeah, every once in a while.  I think he still does a little.  But as far as radio goes,  like, what is he doing?  Last we checked in with him,  he was doing kind of  small town radio, right?  Syndicated with some small town.  My Christian values  are now what I'm pushing on the air.  Turd, get on the cross, turd.  We're going to nail turd on a cross. 
[03:00:00]  He can't get off of his shock jockery,  his shock jock roots.  So he goes Christian, religious,  conservative talk,  but still with turd.  Turd?  Turd's out there protesting  against dead soldiers.  Turd?  What an asshole.  Turd.  Stupid turd.  How do you agree to be turd?  I know.  Like, how does that fucking happen?  I mean, we've had some winners  on this show  as far as interns and things go. 
[03:00:30]  But how do you agree  to be turd?  It's bad enough  I have to go through life as Opie,  trust me.  Imagine being turd?  I fucking hate the name.  Turd?  It made sense when I was 12  and I didn't have fucking hair  on my balls.  Oh, God.  I'm an older guy now  and I walk around,  hey, Opie.  I hate it.  Even Ron Howard  almost got away from that.  I fucking hate it  if you need to know the truth.  He got away from that  by, like, directing.  At least some people go,  they try to man it up  and go Opie or O. 
[03:01:00]  But I'm fucking Opie.  I fucking hate it.  It gave me a good living  and I'm not going to give  the money back  so I'm a fucking hypocrite.  Give the money back, Dad.  But now that I'm older,  yeah, I fucking hate the name.  You know what?  You just want to go to Greg?  I never liked that name.  That's why I accepted a nickname.  I hated my name.  Hated it.  All right, hello, Bill.  Right.  At least my mom was smart enough  not to make me a Gregory,  which I think is, like,  probably the worst name  you could be named.  Gregory.  Gregory.  I think that's a fine name 
[03:01:30]  for you.  Although when Ted says it,  I kind of enjoy it.  Thank you, Gregory.  I do enjoy what you say.  Of course you do.  It's your name.  But let it be known,  I'm still Opie.  I fucking hate it.  Oh, God.  That's just...  And all I'm saying is  how it relates,  like, being turd,  that's way worse.  Is it just going to be worse?  You think he's in his 40s somewhere  and they're going,  hey, turd.  I'm turd.  Hey, man.  I'm turd.  Hey, man,  I'm trying to bring my daughter to school.  Can you chill on the fucking turd?  Hey, turd,  remember when you 
[03:02:00]  crashed that car, turd?  My name's Brad.  Please.  Hi, Brad.  Could you not call me turd?  Right.  Does it get worse every year?  Like, when you have  these landmark birthdays,  do you think like,  oh, my God,  I'm Opie at...  And then, you know,  throw age here.  It is bad, man.  It is bad, man.  It's so awkward for everybody.  It's awkward for me.  It's awkward for the people  that have to say it.  It was cool 
[03:02:30]  when you were fucking eight.  It stopped being cool  when we moved to New York, probably.  It was okay  in, like, Massachusetts.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, because we were, like...  Still playing young music.  We were building up  the name of the show  and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like,  I got a son now, man.  Well, you can't...  Is he going to call you  dad or Opie?  It's the wimpiest name ever.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, God.  Maybe that's why  I had to try to play  the over-the-top tough guy  on the radio  because I was aware  that my name  is the fucking wimpiest. 
[03:03:00]  It's not a bad name.  It's horrible.  Makes you think  of a small town  and flowers.  Piece of pie.  Mount Pilot?  Oh, whatever.  You know what's  a cute nickname?  Kids like when you call  them, hey, turkey foot.  What is turkey foot?  You kiss that foot  and you go...  You make a turkey sound.  You're a disgusting man.  Turkey foot.  Yum.  Anything for an angle, huh?  Any angle you can get 
[03:03:30]  on that...  On that getting a...  Getting a kid.  Hey, you want a turd update  or not?  Oh, please.  We might have it.  When Brittany went  through her problems,  Billy said that would  never happen to his daughter.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And all man-cow stuff  is real.  Up to a point,  Mark in Chicago wants to say.  Really?  Which one do you want first?  Up to a point.  And then someone is begging  that we play  any old man-cow pick.  I know.  It's just... 
[03:04:00]  Which one haven't we  played in a while, E-Rock?  It's one of my favorite  things to do.  We have a whole disc  full of them.  Let me go get it.  But find one we haven't  played in a while.  Not the one where he  drives the car,  where Turd drives the car.  We've heard that one.  I love it.  Is Turd okay, though?  Let's find out.  Let's find out.  Let's go to Joe in Illinois.  We want to know about Turd.  We're very concerned  about Turd.  Where's Turd?  Turd.  Joe.  Hello, you there?  Yeah, let's go, Joe.  Yeah, where's Turd?  I believe he is running  an ice cream parlor  that he named after  his son, Nick.  It's called Nick's Licks. 
[03:04:30]  And I think it's  in Piatown, Illinois.  Really?  Or are you just  plugging a place?  No, no, no.  All right.  What else does he do?  Is he a manager  at the Cincinnati Funny Bone?  Why would you say that?  This weekend.  That's really weird.  Hold on.  Let me Google it.  All right.  I wonder if they have  a special chocolate.  ice cream,  the turd.  It's like,  ah, God,  could I have a turd?  There's a store there  under that name,  but it's not  an ice cream place.  Wow.  Well, what is Nick's Licks? 
[03:05:00]  Nick's Licks.  Nick's Licks is a  kids' baby's clothes.  Wait, you're trying  to tell me there's  a business called  Nick's Licks  and it's not  an ice cream place?  It's kids' baby clothes.  That's fucking weird.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  I don't know  if you know  about Turd  then there, Joe.  It's like Paul's Malls  with M-A-U-L.  Get out of here,  turkey foot.  Ew.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Yeah.  And are the kids' feet  all, like, wet after that?  Yeah, they smell  like cigarettes. 
[03:05:30]  Because Uncle Paul smokes.  Yeah, they smoke.  What do you smoke?  Viceroy?  I like moors.  Moors.  A nice tipperillo.  Oh, the kids' feet  smell like saliva.  Like sour cigarette  breath tongue.  Oh, God.  Sour cigarette tongue.  Terrible.  Go wash your feet. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, your feet.  So your mutter  doesn't smell them.  Yeah, one time  they walked in  and the mutter thought  that she walked  through cat tinkle.  Go in here  and wash your feet  good.  Ah, shit.  Ah, look who's here.  It's E-Rock.  Yeah.  Ah, he's got some  turd bits.  Hey, turd.  You got one?  Turd.  Hey.  These are some  of the great man-cow.  Wait, let me look  at the disc.  Oh, God.  Turkey touch.  Please.  One through nine.  One through nine.  And people say  that the man-cow, 
[03:06:30]  you're in man-cow country.  It was one of the  funniest bits ever.  Have we played that  in a while?  Oh, God.  No, we haven't.  Could we play that today?  Is it?  Remember that.  At 10 o'clock?  That or the Jericho.  Either one.  What?  That or the Jericho.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we were going  to replay the Jericho.  We did a lot of Jericho  today, though.  What do you want  to do, Ant?  I, hey, this, I love  Let's go man-cow country.  I love listening  to this shit.  Let's go, yeah.  You're in man-cow country.  It's one of the best  radio beatings we've  given in years.  Turd.  Well, oh. 
[03:07:00]  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  All right.  Here we go.  Do you want to hear?  That's someone saying  the kids' feet smell  like they were firewalking.  Little turkey feet.  They loved it.  This was, thank you, yes.  You want to hear, uh, cheers.  I don't know what that one is.  Chicken legs.  Pale head.  Chicken legs.  Oh, turkey feet.  These are your choices.  Pale head.  Uh, Rocky blessing.  Snap, crackle, call. 
[03:07:30]  Air horn to the ear.  We did cleaning off  the boss's desk  way too much.  Yeah, that's a great one.  And we've done the fucking  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  He's crashing into the  fake wall  in the production studio.  In the production studio.  Where you hear the engine  like it's in the studio.  But you hear  Turd like he's on the phone.  That is the worst  production job ever.  You have to run  the sound effects  through a phone filter.  So at least it sounds  like you're outside.  Yeah, EQ it. 
[03:08:00]  That's what we did at AF.  I mean, all our bits at AF  were real.  Our bra bombing.  Of course.  How did you guys  fucking jump in a balloon  like that?  There's no reason.  It was very difficult.  It's not about us.  We could focus on us tomorrow.  And you're supposed  to bring in your tape.  Yeah.  Oh, I have it on my desk.  I'm ready to bring it in.  We're going to launch  Car Crash Comedy.  Yeah.  If we end in 10 minutes  we could do both bits.  Is that the greatest thing  you've ever heard?  I want to.  I want to.  Which one do you want to hear?  You're picking today, man.  What was it?  Cheers. 
[03:08:30]  Okay.  Chicken Legs,  Pale Head,  Rocky Blessing,  Snap Crackle Call.  We'll stop there.  Because I think we've done  the air horn to the year  a lot, too.  How about Pale Head?  Pale Head.  I don't know what it is.  I don't remember,  but I'm thinking Pale Head.  Hello?  Yes?  Oh, God.  I'm glad I got you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's a Pale Head.  Okay.  He's calling someone  because get this, people.  Get this.  Ready for this? 
[03:09:00]  He's got a Pale  stuck on his head,  I think.  I got a Pale  stuck on my head.  Cigars and Scotch  calling it Fail Head.  Fail Head.  I have to admit,  I love our listeners  when they're beating us up properly.  I really do,  because I think people get confused.  Oh, yeah.  Because I get really frustrated  by some,  a certain,  element,  element of our,  our quote,  fans.  Blacks. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  The,  the,  the,  but when you beat us up properly,  I love it.  And this guy's,  you know,  because we're trying to figure out  what Mancow bit to play,  and this guy writes,  Ryan,  he goes,  oh,  how about when Anthony  called Mancow?  Yeah,  play that bit.  Great.  When I did the perfect  phone caller bit.  Finally had a chance.  Oh,  God.  All right,  let's go to Pale Head.  Right there,  and I fucked it up.  Here's the Pale Head.  Hello?  Yes?  Oh,  God,  I'm glad I got you.  Doctor.  Excuse me?  Help. 
[03:10:00]  Help me.  What's your name?  My name is Larry.  I got a bucket stuck on my head.  What am I supposed to do?  Uh,  hold just one moment,  okay?  Help!  Can't breathe.  Much longer.  Sir?  Hello?  Yeah?  All right.  I fell down.  Yes,  and you have a bucket  stuck on your head?  I have a bucket  stuck on my head.  Okay.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Can I stop it?  Did you hear the  bad fucking  sound effect? 
[03:10:30]  You hear the bad sound effect?  He's using cartoon sound effects  and hoping  the woman on the other line  won't notice.  That was squeaky hinge sound  number 28.  I have a bucket  stuck on my head.  Okay.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Can you hold on?  Join Guns N' Roses.  Hello?  Sir, do you have anybody there with you?  No.  Okay, the best thing...  My dog, Larry.  Okay, the best thing is to call an ambulance.  Hell no, I gotta get over it.  I need some help from my doctor. 
[03:11:00]  Okay.  Hello?  Hi, this is Dr.  How may I help you?  I fell down  and I got a bucket  on my head  that I cannot get off.  Okay.  All right?  What you really need to do, though,  is call 911.  What about, like, a crowbar?  What I would say  is call the ambulance  and let them help you  get it off safely.  Ow!  I'm trying...  Oh, God.  Ah!  I'm trying to...  Pull it.  It just won't come off.  Sir?  Yeah?  What I want you to do  is hang up with me  and call 911  and they'll help you out. 
[03:11:30]  You're a lady!  Kind of neat acoustically.  Okay.  It sounds pretty good, doesn't it?  You call 911  and...  Hello, hello, hello.  911?  911?  Hello?  Okay.  Good luck.  Let me try a crowbar.  Mmm.  Mmm.  You just slipped a crowbar out.  Ah!  That's a good one.  Much better.  That's good.  I had a bucket head.  It's good.  Ah.  People eat this shit up  in Chicago, man. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  Look, we weren't perfect.  We've done some fucking  hacky things.  I'm not gonna lie to you.  It's time to admit  some of this shit,  but...  Wow.  That is...  But, wow.  We're gonna have to play  another one  because that's...  Oh, please.  Please do.  But first,  we got the babbling reporter.  Remember I said  because of the thing  from Grammy's...  Babbling reporter, yeah.  Someone tweeted this yesterday  to me and I appreciate it.  It was another babbling reporter.  And I think this one,  they hinted that  it might have been epilepsy  and that's why  I'm playing this.  Did she have some kind  of weird epileptic fit 
[03:12:30]  or something?  Well, they're doing tests.  Or someone explained  that a migraine headache  could make your fucking brain...  Yeah.  I think it would seem  cold hard  if they fired her  on the spot.  Hey, motherfuckers.  Let me tell you what...  First of all,  butt plug  was a real call.  I don't want to hear...  Oh, man.  Butt plug was a real call.  It might be a little dated,  but I would...  That fucking call  was all right, man.  Of course it was.  I could fucking head you  in a direction  of ones where you would 
[03:13:00]  get to us,  but that one was...  Wait, what was...  It wasn't bad.  What was the one  with the dress  where you were both  on the phone?  That was horrible.  What was that?  No, baby clothes.  Adult baby clothes.  Yeah, there it's terrible.  If you want to make fun,  that was horrible.  Was that a bad one?  But that was a real call, too.  Well, the man cow...  The man cow is a real call.  He actually, you know,  called somebody  that bought into the dumb shit.  But just to see  how long you can go  saying one word,  like butt plug,  that's, you know...  It was...  That's a... 
[03:13:30]  It was fun.  That's a class bit  right there.  It was fun.  Here's another news reporter  just fucking talking  some weird language.  Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen  says Wisconsin  is the latest state  including Iowa, Kansas, Maine,  Ohio, and Wyoming  to join Florida's suit.  The state claiming  the exorcist  saw untisracho  and play bring rights  by health ursit.  President Obama  will head to... 
[03:14:00]  Whoa.  You know what?  I just remembered.  You've got to see  the video really fast, Danny.  Holy shit.  Does she freak out?  I forgot.  They go to the other lady  and she's just standing there  like, holy shit.  Are you okay?  Really?  But then she had to  keep her composure  and do the next story.  Isn't it amazing  how fucking non-human they are?  She couldn't go,  hey, are you okay?  Gotta just be robots.  Who is that?  I don't know why  the news has this weird...  Don't react.  Because they're fucking assholes.  That's why.  Do not react.  And the other thing  about the Grammy reporter lady, 
[03:14:30]  fucking CBS.  Copyright.  They're forcing everyone  to take the video down.  Yeah.  Fucking assholes.  They are assholes, man.  Let us fucking laugh.  There's nothing wrong with it.  But they're going after  everybody that posted  that fucking video.  It might be down a bit.  I don't know, Danny.  I'm sorry to make you fucking...  And she got...  Yeah, here it is.  Look, you gotta just see...  They're saying it might have been epilepsy.  Really?  This is another woman. 
[03:15:00]  No, this is the same one,  but I just want you to see...  Oh, see the face.  Okay.  Let me see her, yeah.  Well, it's taking a while to...  This is fucking...  This is the reporter.  Yeah, she...  Fucking...  For the new computer to kick in.  Is this a new computer?  Yeah.  There we go.  ...span reporting from our Rock County Bureau  at the Janesville Gazette.  Thanks, Marco.  Well, Wisconsin has officially joined  25 other states in a lawsuit  against President Obama's  health care reform law.  Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen 
[03:15:30]  says Wisconsin is the latest state  including Iowa, Kansas, Maine,  Ohio, and Wyoming  to join Florida's suit.  The state claiming the exorcist  saw unto Sracho  and play Bringrits  by  Health Urzant.  Holy shit.  That fucking bobblehead doll lady  who was next to you.  She was like looking at her like...  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Now the only thing...  What she said. 
[03:16:00]  Was she trying to say towns?  I don't know what she was trying.  That to me was gibberish.  Totally gibberish?  Gibberish.  Because I wasn't sure  if maybe she started  mispronouncing towns  and then fucking just lost it.  Damn.  There's really any difference...  Sound like Gabby Johnson.  What's up?  I'm just happy the children are here  to hear Gabby Johnson say that  in real authentic Old West gibberish.  I'm blazing saddles. 
[03:16:30]  But there's really any difference  between that  and when a woman just talks regularly.  That's all you hear.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's go to Matt.  Oh, we lost Matt.  He brought up a call.  He said the greatest call we made  was the elderly Alzheimer's guy  in the phone booth  trying to cross the road.  In the phone booth.  What drove me nuts about that,  we never had an ending to that  that I was ever satisfied with. 
[03:17:00]  No, no.  There's no way to really end it.  I tried a bunch of edits with that  and the call is amazing  but we never...  With prank calls,  you have to have that big...  Right?  Yeah.  You need like a...  But still an amazing call  from the AF days as well.  Hey, Australian news anchor  takes a shot at Sports Reporter.  I was suspicious if this was real  but a lot of the guys around here  are saying they think it's real.  Real?  Is this a real or fake?  But a lot...  I guess we go real. 
[03:17:30]  Danny, you got the video of this?  I don't know what this is.  Oh, really?  I'm trying to remember  where I saw it yesterday.  You might just put in  Australian news anchor  because it's going viral.  Some guy was showing off  a tiny little ridiculous  tiny, tiny like trophy  and then they went back  to the guys at the desk  and they made a comment  how small it is  and useless it is.  I want to see it.  I heard about this.  Well, I'll play it over here  but the video is pretty good too 
[03:18:00]  on this one  for a reference point.  And England skipper Andrew Strauss  arrived in London  proudly showing off  the little urn.  I'll spend four...  The little urn!  The little urn!  But it looked like an SNL bit  because the little urn  was literally...  I'm showing you.  What is that?  Maybe three inches?  Yeah.  Oh, you got it?  Oh, there it is.  I'm here.  All right.  Let's give it a...  And England skipper Andrew Strauss  arrived in London  proudly showing off  the little urn.  I'll spend four days at home  before flying out  for the World Cup. 
[03:18:30]  And Belinda,  I just can't understand  how something so small  can be so impressive.  Well, Mark,  you would know about that.  Thank you very much.  Weather's next  with Jane Riley  but first,  here's George Negus.  That's hilarious.  It's hilarious  but I'm...  A little dick joke.  I'm suspicious.  Yeah, I'm very suspicious.  You are, right, Danny?  All right.  We have to get it out...  It almost looks like  an onion type thing.  Yeah, she's too quick.  There's no reaction.  They cut away from him  too quickly.  Usually on shots like that  they keep both reporters...  Right, right.  I'm very suspicious  that maybe they're going  for some kind of viral thing.  Maybe. 
[03:19:00]  You would know about that  and then, yeah.  Especially with it being...  Tiny wee-wee joke.  With it being...  I mean, if that's Australia,  they're very loose in Australia.  I have a feeling  that the anchor would...  They would probably have  some fun, you know,  banter about that  aside from just ignoring it  like it never happened  and moving on.  You know, can we play  my favorite anchor bit  of all time?  It's when you have  a few shots.  Oh, that's a great one.  You have that really fast.  We'll end the show  with that today.  I love that one.  We're talking about  anchor people 
[03:19:30]  kind of taking shots  and shots.  The argument?  It's my favorite one.  Anchor fights.  Anchor fights.  Is that what it's called?  Oh, that's the one  where she has a few belts.  Yeah, a few belts.  Right, right.  In between newscasts.  Jimmy, what do you got, man?  Oh, I have...  Cincinnati.  Funny Bone.  Funny Bone.  Cincinnati.  This Thursday through Saturday.  Cincy.  Then March 5th.  Montclair, Walmart Theater.  And you know that  my anti-social network show  with Brewer, Attell, and Burr  is on sale now  for Foxwoods, April 30th. 
[03:20:00]  It certainly is.  That's going to be a sellout.  I hope so.  All right.  You got that, E-Rock.  And after the break,  I think we're doing  Man Cow Country, that bit,  and possibly the Jericho thing.  Yeah.  All right.  I have something to listen to  on the way home.  Absolutely.  But at first,  the anchor people  go at it.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  Do you hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining  because tonight I said hey.  Then we better talk about it  because I think you've got a problem.  I think we've got a problem. 
[03:20:30]  All right?  If that's what you think,  then we'll talk about it  after the show  and we'll talk about it  with Roger Bell  because I'm not going to sit here  night after night  and put up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well,  it looks to me  like that's the way  it's going to go, Ann.  I'll take the ante up  a little higher than that even.  You're not only wrong,  you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  If you want Harold Green,  you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Good old Harold Green. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know,  you go home  and have a couple of shooters  and I don't know  what the fuck happens,  but when you come back,  you're not the same lady.  That's not true.  Some nights it is, Ann.  When news happens,  you see it happen  on Channel 7.  The number one station 
[03:21:30]  for news and information  in Southern California.  Now,  Paul Moyer,  Ann Martin,  Johnny Mountainweather,  and Todd Donahoe Sports.  This is Eyewitness News Tonight.  Three men dead tonight  in an execution-style murder  in Los Angeles.  Good evening, all.  It's...  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  The O.P. Anthony Show  on the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
