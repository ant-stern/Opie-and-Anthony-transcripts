<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a detailed recounting of the hosts’ experience at a Bruce Springsteen concert.  They critiqued Springsteen’s physique (mentioning tight jeans and suspected padding), the large size of his backing band, and the setlist, highlighting a rare performance of "Bishop Dance."  They shared negative interactions with a concertgoer wielding an obstructive sign, and a humorous anecdote about a fellow attendee falling in the hallway. Their conversation segued into a critical discussion of the Occupy Wall Street movement,  followed by a shift to their own physical fitness, leg cramps, and Opie's father's disciplinary style.  The segment also touched on a viral video of a child dangerously close to a lion at a zoo.  Studio guests during this portion included Roland and Jim Brewer, with mentions of Debbie (from the Yankees organization), Ross (a disruptive friend), and Fuzzy.  The hosts referenced "Bruce Juice," "Ruth Juice," and "chicken fingers."


The show then transitioned into a discussion about the hypothetical scenario of fighting a lioness, exploring comical and ultimately ineffective human attack strategies. This led into a humorous anecdote about a fare dispute on a New Jersey Transit train, where they almost got kicked off due to insufficient funds, only to find a twenty-dollar bill unexpectedly saving the day. This sparked a debate about cash versus credit cards.  Caller Sal shared similar train experiences. The discussion then veered towards an upcoming appearance by UFC president Dana White, the previously mentioned Bruce Springsteen concert, and their reactions to social media feedback after watching a documentary on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The hosts played an audio clip of a man attempting cloud manipulation through psychic powers, prompting much laughter.  Jim Brewer joined the show in studio at this point, regaling listeners with a lengthy and hilarious story about a disastrous Fourth of July fireworks display in the Outer Banks.


Jim Brewer’s extended anecdote detailed a series of escalating mishaps, starting with a near-arrest for fireworks violations, thanks in part to his friend Larry’s unique phrasing ("coming up negative").  The story continued with three separate fires: one under the stairs, a grease fire, and a major blaze engulfing the front of the house.  Their attempts to put out the fires with sand and a hose ultimately led to a call to the fire department, all while a real estate agent arrived to fix a jammed kitchen drawer.  The group later repainted damaged trees and bushes to cover their tracks. The conversation shifted to Brewer's experiences homeschooling, comparing raising daughters and sons, specifically discussing the challenges of adolescence and protecting his daughters from negative influences.  A call from Jay Moore injected further bizarre humor. Brewer also shared anecdotes from his stand-up career, including Australian experiences, his time on SNL, and impressions of various celebrities (including Lorne Michaels). He promoted his upcoming Starland Ballroom performance.  The hosts further discussed David Attell's comedy and the aforementioned cloud-manipulation video.


The show continued with a discussion about the Guns N' Roses/Metallica tour, focusing heavily on Axl Rose’s perceived ego and how Metallica allegedly overshadowed Guns N' Roses, contributing to the latter band’s decline.  The hosts and possibly a caller debated the timeline of albums and the tour's impact, mentioning a Metallica documentary highlighting James Hetfield’s negative reaction to Slash.  The conversation was punctuated with profanity and vulgar comparisons.  Dana White called in, discussing a recent UFC pay-per-view event, upcoming fights (including Nate Diaz vs. Jim Miller), and UFC events on FOX.  He shared details about his high-stakes blackjack gambling habits, including anecdotes about his aggressive behavior at the table and his security guard needing a pillow for protection.  The hosts offered UFC tickets to listeners. Jim Brewer returned to the studio, sharing stories from his trip to Australia (including a high-speed police chase), first-class airline travel, and reminiscing about his youth on Long Island, comparing the difficulties of making friends without cell phones to modern communication ease.  The segment ended with a promotion for Steven Singer Jewelers and a preview of the "Opie and Anthony Live" show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it. Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  How is everybody now?  Grand, I hope.  You're doing good.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  Boy, I hate that Ricky Gervais says that so many times.  He's just in the intro. We need a new intro, man.  Good morning.  I like the bitch. 
[00:00:30]  But I do believe there's a lot of listeners out there that like to bitch a little more than I do.  Bitch.  I really see today.  Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?  I should have blown my nose this morning before the show. I should have blown my nose.  Are you allergic to stuff?  Yeah, probably.  Allergents?  Allergens.  But there was rain. Doesn't the rain knock down all those allergens?  I think it kind of fucks with it a little bit.  It gets it in the air a little more.  You think it bounces it around a little bit?  It bounces it around.  I heard thunderstorms last night.  Was that true? 
[00:01:00]  You hear that shit?  Yes, I did hear some out on the island.  That's what I miss about living in a big building here in New York City.  Yeah.  The suburbs, man.  Those thunderstorms.  In the middle of the night, you just feel like, ah.  Yeah.  It's so peaceful.  I know it wakes you up, but then you listen a little bit, and you kind of just roll over  and go back to sleep nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard a few last night.  I missed that.  I heard one of those.  I like the low, rumbly ones at a distance, but I heard one that was just like that.  Right out your window?  Where it goes. 
[00:01:30]  That's destroying something.  That loud crackle first, and then bam!  Oh.  See, I missed that.  That is nice.  Did I ever bring to the program that I used to, and I could very easily do again, I would  listen to Thunder and Rain CDs when I went to bed.  Oh, did you do that?  It was like one of those, yeah, you know, you get that ambient sound thing, makes you  go to sleep easier.  Well, that was when I was living in the basement of a brownstone here in New York City with 
[00:02:00]  the mice and the cockroaches.  So you weren't getting really any cool sounds from the place.  No, man.  So I made my own.  Yeah.  I had a Thunder and Rain one, which was awesome.  I had a Rainforest one.  That was great.  Rainforest, man.  The Rainforest one was good, because you don't really hear the thunder for some reason.  It's just rain.  Constantly.  Running water.  And running water.  And then a nice little, the waves.  Yeah, yeah.  But one of my wave CDs, there was one wave that was a little too loud that would always  wake me up.  Oh, man, the one. 
[00:02:30]  But everything else was within range of what you need to sleep.  I don't know the fucking, you know, the technical fucking jargon.  Yeah, but there's like a sound range that's good, optimum for sleeping.  Yeah, where you're not going to be woken up.  But then there's one wave in this stupid CD that always hits, and then I wake up.  How often did it repeat?  It was like an hour CD, so.  Uh-oh.  But I think this particular wave happened a bunch, enough in a pattern, where I couldn't  sleep to that one.  Oh, that's a lemon. 
[00:03:00]  But in New York City, you get the really echoey thunder.  Yeah, through the buildings, yep.  It's the thunder, not the lightning.  Yeah.  Which is kind of creepy.  It bounces off and echoes and shit.  A little echo.  It's ominous.  Like, that doesn't seem relaxing at all.  It's not relaxing, yeah.  It's kind of creepy, and yeah, in the city.  Thunder in the city is weird.  Yeah.  It should just be a suburb or rural area.  Yeah.  Nice.  I don't know.  I sleep to TV, and last night I had on whatever channel's running that, the hunt for Osama 
[00:03:30]  Bin Laden.  Oh, right.  So, like, I'm just fucking trying to sleep to AK-47 fire and fucking RPGs.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  You probably slept like a baby, knowing you.  I did, yeah.  I really did.  It was pretty fucking cool.  That's your baby Einstein.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  All right.  I see Roland's in nice and early.  Wow, what's Roland doing?  Oh, he looks like shit.  Roland, what's the matter?  But he doesn't party or anything. 
[00:04:00]  He's just...  Bruce out?  Nah, he's just tired.  He's Bruce-ed out?  I get too excited until September I go back.  Notice who chose not to be a Bruce buddy.  Bruce!  Sam, who doesn't know one Bruce Springsteen song, and Roland, who knows every Springsteen  song, are Bruce buddies with their Bruce Springsteen t-shirts.  They're matching Bruce Springsteen t-shirts on the big show last night.  They really are.  You should get both those guys to sign the shirt.  Oh, that's a nice...  What?  Why?  The big man.  He's up there.  Yeah, Clarence is dead.  Oh, oh, so that guy couldn't sign it. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, I gotcha.  Oh.  No, it was very emotional when his nephew played the first saxophone of the night.  Yeah.  You know, and then he fist-pumped, like, yeah, I did it for the big man!  It was kind of cool.  Yeah, I saw it.  I saw the show.  I got a scolding last night, so I'm not allowed to, like, trash Bruce Springsteen.  I got brand new friends in very high places.  High places.  Because of Roland, by the way.  Yeah.  Roland, no offense to you, but I had a little discussion with Ant.  There's a bunch of people around here that think you're, like, full of shit at times, 
[00:05:00]  and then you prove time and time again you're not full of shit.  It's the most bizarre thing.  I don't know why anyone likes you.  I don't know why anyone communicates with you.  It's amazing.  Because of how you talk and stuff.  But these people love him like a panda bear.  It really is odd.  Bruce.  Is it the Bruce connection?  I love Bruce, yeah.  But is that why people, you know, gravitate toward you?  We got the Yankee lady who gave me a scolding.  Yeah.  I kind of threw Anthony under the bus a little bit because he wasn't there. 
[00:05:30]  But we do that with each other.  Of course.  I know he's thrown me under the bus because I haven't been in situations.  But this lady goes, I'm a huge fan of your show.  And she's, like, way up there in the Yankees organization.  And she's like, you know, I hope you don't go on the air tomorrow and trash this.  I go, no, that's Anthony.  I go, that's Anthony.  That's Anthony's bitch.  You know, he has that great impression of Springsteen.  And it kind of, you know, it's Anthony.  I go, but if you sat Anthony down, I bet you he would tell you he's actually a Bruce Springsteen fan. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And she's rolling her eyes like, yeah, right.  I am.  She goes, I bet you you'll become a fan by the end of tonight.  Well, they say, I told you, even on yesterday, Sean, like the fans always go, dude, you just  see one show, you'll be a fan.  It's amazing.  You know what?  Bruce.  I think it would be way better if I spun this and, and, and, you know, fucked around  with this.  But yeah.  Fuck, dude.  It was an amazing show.  I said the same thing when we went to the Apollo.  Yeah.  But this is his motherland in Jersey. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  But I am down.  Jersey.  I was trying to remember the last time I saw Bruce Springsteen, and honestly, it could  be, it could be 15 years easy.  Wow.  And I sat there and went, this fucking guy deserves everything he gets, man.  People love Bruce Springsteen.  They love him.  They love the, the man himself besides his music.  And you, and it comes across very well when he's, uh, you know, fronting that band.  There's like seven, this, I was counting.  There was 17 to 20 people on that stage.  Yeah.  It was about 17 people in his band.  It's amazing.  But they all, he's a, he's a blue collar guy when he's not rocking like that. 
[00:07:00]  He actually does some roofing.  Yep.  He goes up and does a roofing, a shingle work, a brick work.  Pablo.  Chop, chop, chop, chop.  He's, uh, also a great carpenter.  Yep.  Yep.  He just sits there and frames out houses.  He's a blue collar guy.  Like Jesus.  Exactly.  Like Jesus.  I learned that a lot of people have fell on hard times.  Did you learn that from Bruce?  And they, they have lost a lot lately.  Lately.  Sure.  Don't worry that they're all wearing $40 fucking Bruce Springsteen t-shirts. 
[00:07:30]  But we'll ignore that part of it.  Because Bruce is talking to the people.  Times are really tough here in Jersey.  This guy just fell down.  I understand.  Holy shit.  Is he okay?  He's having trouble getting back up.  Some guy just fell in the hallway.  His shoe came off.  Ask him if he's all right.  Oh, man.  Oh, he fell right out of his shoe.  Is he all right?  I don't know.  Who cares?  He's walking kind of funny.  I'm talking Bruce.  He fucked his ankle pretty good.  What happened?  I think he turned his ankle as he was walking.  Is that one of the out-cue guys?  One of the out-cue guys fell really like, wow. 
[00:08:00]  Is he all right?  He's limping really badly.  But we're talking Bruce.  Yeah, but he was walking down a hall with nothing to trip him and just fell out of nowhere.  Do you ever have your ankle just go, whomp, when you're walking?  You're like, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.  Is he all right, Kenny?  He didn't, he looked.  He's limping pretty good.  He's limping good now.  Yeah.  He's limping to begin with yesterday.  Oh, he's limping.  Okay, maybe he's got a bad leg.  So I learned people, you know, have fell on hard times.  From Bruce, you learned this. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And then I also learned that we've got to take care of our own.  We do?  Oh, yeah.  What is that, like paying our fair share of taxes?  No, he supports the OWS movement.  Yeah.  Because he acknowledged, I wrote this song before the Occupy Wall Street movement started.  Bruce.  He has a responsibility.  He knows he makes a lot of money, but he, I think he feels for those people.  Jack, the Occupy Wall Street, he's behind that?  He has to.  All right, look, what a dick. 
[00:09:00]  No, the lady's going to be pissed.  Look, look, I don't care.  This is where I go, no, it's Anthony, not me.  Look, his music's great.  He fucking gets up there.  He rocks the room.  It's fucking amazing to watch.  But, man, when he starts with that shit in between songs, Occupy Wall Street are a bunch  of fucking little cunts.  They are.  Did you see some of the video clips over the past couple of days?  I know they arrested 86 people here in New York.  And it should have been fucking 1,086.  I really didn't see any clips.  10,000. 
[00:09:30]  What was the vibe with the whole thing?  Because they brought the OWS movement back to New York a couple of days ago.  Well, they tried, but it's petering out ridiculously.  And, well, I saw a clip of cops, and they're trying to keep people off the street and on  the sidewalk.  And this policewoman has her helmet on and stuff like that, and her nightstick out.  And she's not whipping people, but she's using her nightstick as like a barrier to push  people back on the sidewalk.  As she's doing it, some fucking little pussy fucking asshole comes up behind her and just 
[00:10:00]  smacks her in the fucking back of the head.  Really?  With like a, what was he holding?  Like a, it looked like a helmet or something.  I don't even know.  Right.  But, oh, a drum.  Wow, that's a lot of people, though, man.  A lot of people came out for the big May Day protest.  No, it's not.  That's exactly, that's just where the crowd is.  Oh, wait, it looks like more media.  I'm not sure.  How many people are there?  A couple hundred?  Maybe a couple hundred.  And now, look, see, watch this scene.  Yeah, I'm watching.  Watch this scene.  Oh, I'm watching.  This is great.  They're arresting people, and as they arrest people, now they're not just standing there 
[00:10:30]  yelling.  They're jumping in and pushing and hitting the cops, trying to pull their little Occupy  Wall Street people away from the cops, arresting them.  It's ridiculous.  And starting fights, and I love when they just get punched in the fucking face.  These guys are little fucking pussies.  They're all dressed in black.  Matt, we're dressed in black, man.  We're like ninjas, man.  Oh, I hate Occupy Wall Street.  But they're trying to get things done. 
[00:11:00]  They're getting nothing done.  You sure?  They're pussies.  They're going after the 1%.  The 1%.  They're going after the cops.  And then, great idea.  Great idea.  Instead of closing down the city like they said they were going to, they left suspicious  packages and backpacks at various locations.  Oh, really?  So the cops were overwhelmed with investigating suspicious packages.  What does that do?  Besides put everyone in danger, because now if there is a real problem, their resources 
[00:11:30]  are spread thin.  It's just fucking idiots.  They have no purpose.  They don't even know what they're doing.  There's no one real cause here.  What are they trying to battle besides the cops?  I got the feeling that Bruce kind of backs the movement a little bit.  What is he backing?  Hey, man, we got to take care of our own.  We all got to rise up.  Our own?  Do you realize Bruce is a .00001%?  We got to get rid of some of this rust.  There's too much rust around. 
[00:12:00]  Rust.  Yeah, rust, man.  Business and stuff that closed down a long time ago.  There's a lot of rust on those things.  Oh.  So we got to get rid of that rust.  You know?  We got to start cleaning up some shit and reopening some shit.  Some factories and whatnot.  Some steel plants.  Steel plants.  What year is this?  An observation about Bruce.  He's 62.  Yeah.  Might be time to, you know, loosen up the jeans a little bit.  This guy.  He does wear his tight jeans.  Oh, you know what I'm talking about?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I forgot. 
[00:12:30]  You know what I forgot?  I forgot that I was on vacation when you went and saw Bruce.  I saw Bruce.  So you know all this stuff.  Yes, absolutely.  And I was thinking the same thing.  So we can finally have our Bruce Springsteen conversation.  I was thinking the same thing.  It's not that I'm looking.  It's right in front of you.  And he's got, like, big, like, ass muscles.  And he's got...  I don't even know how the fuck the guy gets into these jeans.  Big ass muscles.  And then I think he might be packing a little in front.  Oh, yeah.  Artificially.  You think he's stuffing?  Just a little bit. 
[00:13:00]  You think Bruce is stuffing?  Just a little bit.  Roland, is this upsetting you hearing Opie say he thinks Bruce is stuffing the front of his pants?  Because he still moves around good on the stage, but it's a little kind of almost like bold-legged.  He's always been very bold-legged.  But it's how he moves.  And I'm like, that's not because he's old.  It's because his jeans are too tight.  Yeah.  Bruce.  Bruce.  He just goes, Bruce.  Bruce.  But I'm not here to trash this show.  I'm telling you right now.  He did do a song that he hasn't done since 73, Bishop Dance. 
[00:13:30]  What?  He did a song called Bishop Dance.  What is that?  It's a song that hasn't been played since 73.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does he do that on purpose?  Like, I'm not going to play this song.  For 40 fucking years.  Everybody freaked out.  I was like jizzing.  How do you know he hasn't played this in 40 fucking years?  We all...  How do you know that everywhere he's fucking played...  They know.  You haven't caught every show he's ever done.  I know, but...  They know.  Bishop Dance.  I was...  I mean, we were front and center. 
[00:14:00]  We were with the uber, uber VIP, holy fuck, we love Bruce Springsteen fans.  So I had no business being in that area.  I enjoyed myself, but I felt almost guilty.  There was a lady right next to me on her phone the entire...  People think I'm on my phone a lot.  I actually put my phone in my pocket for most of the show.  And she was on her phone the entire time just looking at set lists of other Springsteen shows.  Holy shit.  And I wanted to, like, nudge her and go, do you realize he's right there?  He's right there.  What are you doing?  You don't have to look up any of this shit. 
[00:14:30]  But I think she was trying to figure out what songs were coming next.  Yeah.  And you know the sign lady, the people who put up the sign?  Oh, jeez.  Well, Ross, after a few Bruce Spirit drinks...  Yeah.  And he walked up to them and said, put your fucking sign down.  Oh, man.  There was a couple that were obviously in love.  What did that sign say?  Something about their stupid marriage or something.  I don't care that you bring a sign to a concert for the most part.  Right.  But there's a major responsibility.  You do realize there are a lot of people in front of you. 
[00:15:00]  And if your seats, they were like five feet in front of us.  So they're literally 15 feet from Bruce Springsteen.  He saw the sign.  Front and center, holding up a sign every time Bruce went to the microphone.  Yeah.  Blocking out the view of probably the entire floor.  You asshole.  If you think about it.  I think I had a beer shower.  Oh, did they?  And people...  Winked beer out.  Yeah.  After every song, people were just going, put down your fucking...  They were nice at first, but...  That was Ross.  Put your fucking sign down.  And then people like Roland just said, he's seen the sign by now. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, God.  No, we can't.  Why don't you put your sign down and let people see me?  So what happened?  He ripped the sign out of their hands?  Oh, no.  He went to them and gave them a talking tube.  Screaming at them.  A talking tube.  I, uh...  Yeah, he had bruise juice in them.  Ross plays a very strange role around here because he's very close friends with Howard Stern,  but he, like, makes believe he likes us, too.  And I don't know how I feel about that.  And he goes, let's see if you make it to Jungle Land, because that's how far the other guy made it. 
[00:16:00]  That's how I...  Whatever.  Yeah, there was some kind of competition.  I went home at 10.15.  I missed, like, the last 45 minutes of the show.  But, uh...  I hear someone else was talking to me about Ross, that he tends to be a problem at some of these things.  Uh-oh.  And he may have been kicked out of a Yankees game for carrying on to...  Wow.  Really?  Because this person didn't know who he was and said, oh, I know who that guy is.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  And he goes, well, tell me more.  This person was telling me, like, oh, you see that guy?  I'm like, yeah, I'm not gonna give in.  I know him.  Oh, man, he's a problem.  I had him thrown out of a Yankees game recently.  Holy shit.  Really?  Ruth Juice.  What was he doing that he got thrown out?  He was just a little...  Yelling?  A little too obnoxious.  A little boisterous?  I go way, way back with Ross.  Way back.  When I was at BAB, he was a music guy working for a music label.  And he got me into a shitload of shows.  So I don't actually hate the guy. 
[00:17:00]  I'm just very suspicious.  It's very strange how...  I love that little boy was singing on a sunny day, and he just screamed, fuck you.  Well, the kids sang out of tune, and we all had to make believe it was good.  Yeah, like four years old, and then...  I don't know if he was four.  He was probably like six or seven.  He's a problem.  Bruce brings a kid up, and obviously the kid's singing along because the word's right in front  of him.  Just singing awfully.  Awfully.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  And there was a...  He was a problem? 
[00:17:30]  No, Ross said, what?  Fuck you, boo!  Everyone else was kind of having a joke.  I loved it.  Because it was kind of a cool moment that Bruce is pulling someone out of the crowd.  I loved it, though.  I'm just joking about it.  Obviously, you know, it's a tough spot for the kid.  It wasn't Courtney Cox he pulled up.  He's never sung before.  He's probably sung Happy Birthday to his friends.  That's about it.  Next thing you know, he's in front of 20,000 Bruce Springsteen fans singing a...  I guess it would be a favorite song.  Yeah.  And Ross is the only one that is talking about, fuck you!  Yeah, I loved it. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  But I'll tell you this.  I didn't hear Born to Run.  What songs did I miss?  You missed Talk to Me.  He did a...  No, I was...  I was leaving during Talk to Me.  He did a Le'Von Helms cover, The Weight.  I know the weight.  Of course.  He did that one, Rocky Ground, Rosalita, Born to Run.  Rosalita jumped a little higher.  Yeah, Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark.  You know Rosalita.  Of course.  And then 10th Avenue Freeze Out.  Dancing in the Dark, 10th Avenue Freeze Out. 
[00:18:30]  And then at the end, he goes, I'll see you guys in September.  And he looked at the floor and pointed at us.  Like, yay!  Pointed at you?  Well, yes.  Wait, he didn't do Jungle Land?  He's coming back to My Life Stadium in September.  He didn't do Jungle Land?  No.  Thunder Road?  No.  I left at a good time then.  Yeah, see?  And then I'll go back in September.  There was a couple...  I think they're new songs, because I never heard them before.  I really liked.  Yeah.  Did he do Dancing in the Dark?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  Is that an encore?  Yeah.  Ah, fucking asshole. 
[00:19:00]  So he goes, one, two, and all the lights come up.  You're like, yeah!  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  That's Bruce.  Did he go, hey, baby, and pull the girl from...  Yes.  Did he pull Roland up from the fucking floor?  I need to lose more weight.  Roland doing the little Courtney Cox dance with Bruce?  I'd be jizzing all over the place.  Wouldn't most people that were at that show like to hear Thunder Road than this song?  Or Jungle Land?  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  Dancing in the Dark was a massive hit, but wouldn't they rather hear, like, Thunder Road? 
[00:19:30]  Jungle Land?  I'll say it again.  Because I want to hear Jungle Land.  Well, Jungle Land, he hasn't played that one since Clarence Pass, so we're waiting for that one.  Oh, that's going to be a moment?  That's going to be one of those moments for the fans?  Yeah, I'll cry.  Everyone's just waiting for that?  Yeah.  He hasn't played that one.  I like this.  He's doing this whole thing.  Yeah.  He's just dancing.  He's dancing in the dark.  Yeah.  That's what he's doing.  But the lights are on during the song.  Oh, that's weird. 
[00:20:00]  So everyone can look around.  Oh, my God.  Look at young Bruce.  Jesus.  What year was this song?  Wow.  It's like 84.  Holy shit.  Is this in 84, 85?  Yeah, because this is the start of the Born USA tour.  Holy shit.  In the homeland of New Jersey.  You know, you realize he does look great for his age, but man, he was a young guy.  You know what?  His body's exactly the same as what we're looking at now.  His mom was in the audience last night.  Was that a big deal for Bruce Springsteen fans?  We've seen him before, but we always give her the loud voice. 
[00:20:30]  We were hanging out with...  Was that guy his nephew or something we were hanging out with?  He kind of looked like Springsteen.  With his tight jeans.  I think he was wearing the exact same jeans last night.  They were the same jeans from his Dance in the Dark video.  A little tight in the jeans.  He saved money on clothes.  He's looking at Courtney.  It looks like he was, you know...  Oh, there's Clarence.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Clarence climbing something.  Oh, boy.  What happened, man?  What song he did last night that I was completely into and he did a long version of? 
[00:21:00]  What?  She's the One.  Oh, yeah?  She's the One is a great song.  And they rearranged it a little bit, it seemed like, last night.  Yeah, for the horns.  Holy fuck.  Because it was Candy's Room and She's the One.  Yeah, I like Candy's Room, too.  I was so happy.  But she's the One, how it just builds and the band got into it.  That could have been my favorite fucking song of the day.  Max Weinberg was just...  He killed him that one.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm so excited.  Is this Eddie and the Cruisers? 
[00:21:30]  Eddie lives.  I don't know the words.  I just don't...  Wow.  Young Courtney Cox was very cute with a little pixie hairdo.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Kind of lesbian-ish.  Yeah, not bad, though.  She's kind of cute.  She doesn't have boobs yet.  There's Clarence.  Oh, boy.  The big man.  Yeah.  She's doing the Bruce dance.  Two very white people dancing up on that stage right there.  He brought the three people up. 
[00:22:00]  They says, call them his stalkers to dance with them on stage.  Oh, really?  Stalkers.  They follow them everywhere.  It's not good to promote that.  Fred in Virginia agrees with Anthony.  Bruce is a phony.  Phony baloney, I think, when it comes to that in-between talk.  Do you think he really gives a shit about Occupy Wall Street people?  Honestly.  Do you think Bruce really gives a shit?  Well, he can't get in the concert, so he...  He gave the impression he did.  What?  That he does.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't think he really does.  I think he's up on that stage saying what he feels he's got to say to be Bruce. 
[00:22:30]  To be Bruce, but then when he's done, he's like, I don't give a shit.  Run them over.  Yeah.  Run them over with my limo.  It wants you to clip a few of those people with the bumper.  His wife wasn't there last night.  No?  No.  Wasn't on stage?  No.  She was home protecting the drugs from their kids.  Yeah.  That's exactly...  What?  That's what he said.  He goes, the drug stash has to be protected.  What is he talking about? 
[00:23:00]  He goes, I don't know, he might have lost his mic for a second.  He goes, she's at home protecting our drug stash from our kids.  That's what he said.  Bruce is crazy.  He's soulful, though, man.  Wow.  I liked it, man.  I got to be honest with you.  And I didn't mind hearing the new stuff, because, fuck, some of this new stuff was good.  Yeah, he rearranged it for the live show.  What was that song again?  I had leaned over.  Shackle and Drone.  Can you play that for a second?  Shackle and Drone.  Shackle and Drone.  Wherever you are in there.  Maybe he's busy. 
[00:23:30]  This is off his new album?  Yeah.  I fucking like this damn thing.  Just a little taste.  A little taste of Bruce Juice on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, boy.  What is this?  What's he doing here?  He's about the man.  It's what?  Check on the drug.  Great morning, last, it's you.  Shackle and another day, closer to the grave.  I thought of you during this song.  Why?  Because the black guy had to go front and center with a washboard and some spoons for the song. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, nice.  And I'm like, Bruce.  Old school.  Anyone could play that shit.  You couldn't get the white guy.  Ah, a little more authentic.  You know how awkward you look with a washboard?  Yeah.  When you got real musicians all around you that really know how to play their instruments?  Was he good on the washboard?  Anyone could be good on that.  You're just like...  I shouldn't hear it.  Yeah, you can barely hear it.  Did you mic it?  No.  Wow.  See this?  This ain't doing anything for me. 
[00:24:30]  Really?  No.  The live version is a lot better.  I don't care.  All right.  Oh, hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Oh, yeah.  Was Chris Christie there?  I think he was supposed to be there.  Yeah?  Who knows?  You didn't get any pictures of him sleeping or nothing?  No, I was just staring at the stage.  Boy, he must be like, I'm awake.  Get some fucking Black Beauties before he goes, I'm awake here. 
[00:25:00]  Just pounding Red Bulls.  Oh, yeah, Red Bulls.  Nope.  Wide awake.  Wide awake.  Wide awake.  Wide awake.  Wide awake.  I know there's an hour to go on the concert, but look at me.  I'm wide awake.  Fucking taxing his shoes.  So you can just push down.  Oh, I'm not asleep.  I got to figure out that standing shit.  Fuck.  I haven't stood for that long in a while.  What do you do?  How do you do that?  You do the lean on one hip thing.  But is there a way?  And then you go to the other side.  I start like...  And just keep doing that.  I start walking in place and... 
[00:25:30]  What are you getting, dysplasia?  Oh, man.  Your fucking legs just get achy.  You can see me on the floor?  This is not because I'm getting older.  It's always been like that.  How do you figure out the standing shit for three hours?  Well, you told me you never fucking do any leg workouts.  Oh.  You got to fucking do some legs.  I'd bike my ass off three, four times a week, though.  That should do something.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Maybe work on the kids.  Maybe work on the kids a little bit.  Because now I can't wear my Frankenstein shoes anymore because everyone makes fun of me.  But, man, those things, fucking, you could stand for eight hours.  Oh, man.  Because you're never on your heels. 
[00:26:00]  They're just always constantly rocking.  You ever grab a shitload of weight and then you squat down and then you just go up on  your toes and then down and up on your toes and down until it feels as if someone injected  hydrochloric acid into your fucking muscles?  Oh, my God.  That's a tough one.  Well, that one hurts.  Why would you do that?  Because my trainer said to do it or he'll punch me in the face.  I just never believed in doing legs.  Yeah, legs are good.  Keeps your fucking, gets your stamina up when you're...  Well, I was always a runner, did the inline skating, now more of a bike guy. 
[00:26:30]  So I figure that's good enough.  Yeah.  I think.  Takes it good.  And then I do like some kind of calf stretch so I don't wake up in the middle of the night  thinking that my fucking leg is on fire.  Holy fuck.  Worst feeling ever.  Yeah, the leg cramp could be the worst pain ever, ever.  How about when it gets so bad you see your entire muscle moving up your body?  Yeah, it just turns into a lump.  And you're trying to hold it in place.  It's moving.  Like some monster under your skin. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, and then any type of movement is excruciating pain, but you have to move to try to get it  back into place.  Terrible.  What is that?  I don't know, but it is the one...  Is that dehydration?  I'm not sure.  I hear it might be dehydration when that shit happens.  But it is the one pain where my father said, the next time I scream like that, I better  have an arrow sticking out of me.  Really?  Yeah, I got a leg cramp and just started screaming at some horse show event.  But I was like, I was sitting on bleachers and I just sort of go, ow, ow!  And he came over, he's like, what?  And I go, I got a cramp on my leg. 
[00:27:30]  It's like, god damn it!  Next time you scream like that, you better have a fucking arrow sticking out of you.  That's funny.  Arrow?  We would have been fucking...  The old west?  Well...  Was it 1860?  I gotta ask you...  I'd never ask you this question.  So you and Joe are very close in age.  Yeah.  More or less, right?  Yeah.  So did he yell at Joe like that?  Nah, Joe was like his own fucking, you know, he kind of...  He almost kind of gave up on Joe.  Joe was like already smoking weed and felt Joe was a lost cause, so he just let Joe do  whatever he wanted. 
[00:28:00]  But me, I was supposed to be the prize of the Kumia fucking name.  Oh, really?  I was supposed to be built into this image that he had of, I don't know, maybe some  rugged cowboy guy?  I don't know.  So I was constantly...  I had to be turned into a man.  You know, no screaming because you have a leg cramp.  Stop it, you faggot.  Get up.  Get up and take the pain.  Take the pain!  He wanted you to be a real man.  Yeah, yeah, you know, like the old west version.  I grew up a little wimpy, too, to be honest with you. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I was a little faggot.  What are you going to do?  I was wimpy as well.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I guess he meant well, but Jesus Christ.  But you guys are both very successful.  He'd be proud.  You think he'd be proud?  I don't know.  I'm sure I'd have some problem being a fucking wuss.  He would love the compound.  He would love the compound.  Oh my God, he would love the compound.  And at least I'm not fucking, you know, inviting bikini-clad men over my house.  That's all he cared about.  That would be good.  He would like the selection of a lady over the house. 
[00:29:00]  That's all he cared about in the end, though, right?  That I wasn't a homo.  Oh boy.  All of his guidance, everything that he guided me toward was in a giant funnel, let's say.  And all that, when it comes out of the bottom of the funnel, was just, please don't be gay.  And he made sure of that.  That was something.  You know how like fathers, some fathers can be accepting even after years.  They'd be like, all right, well, my son Gary is gay. 
[00:29:30]  What are you going to do?  You know, he is my boy.  But my dad would never have been accepting of the gay lifestyle.  He would have been a disowned guy.  He would have been dis-fucking-owned guy, never to have me at the house, never to talk to me ever again.  Father's perspective, that's really sad.  Yeah, is it?  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah?  Well, it turned out I wasn't gay. 
[00:30:00]  Every father goes through your mind, you know?  Sure.  I'll accept.  I swear you I'll accept anything.  But still, you're like, oh, please.  You kind of, I don't give a fuck that it's more accepted in this world.  I'm praying.  I'm praying already.  I really am.  I think it's the mental image that you have.  I think it would just be easier for the kid.  It is easier.  But if it turns out that's the case, I'm all in.  I'll be fine with it.  I'll be fine with it.  There's still a mental image, let's say, of your boy having gay sex. 
[00:30:30]  I'm already praying.  You don't want to think of that, do you?  No, I would think.  As a father, I don't think you would want to picture that.  See?  Imagine that.  Thank you, Sam, for pulling up a picture of an African-American gentleman and a white gentleman having a little kiss.  I absolutely got an open mind about that whole thing now, you know, now that I'm older and educated.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's a real thing.  I absolutely am praying that that's not the case.  Because I think his life would be easier. 
[00:31:00]  He's not showing it.  Some of the kids show signs very early on, even in their twos.  No.  I don't think so, no.  He's not going for mommy's shoes?  No, no.  Is he looking at window treatments?  No.  No?  No?  See, that's good.  He likes playing with toys, like boy toys.  He plays with trucks and cars.  Trucks and cars.  There you go.  We have heard.  Oh, I never liked the trucks and the cars.  I played with my sister's dolls from an early age. 
[00:31:30]  I remember that.  Just like that.  And he was always in mom's closet.  Right.  Just always putting the shoes on.  And from an early age, I was wearing mom's clothes.  He liked wearing the skirts.  He would put them around them.  I work on that.  All right.  We don't need men kissing men.  Oh, my God.  I think everyone understands what we're talking about without the visual, Sam Roberts.  Sam.  It was quick, wasn't it?  It was quick.  It was quick.  Yeah.  Great.  You pull that up real quick.  Men kissing each other.  Good one.  Sam wants everybody to like him.  He doesn't know one Bruce Springsteen show. 
[00:32:00]  Look, he's wearing a Springsteen shirt.  He's rocking it.  And then, and then, and then, like, I don't know, there's Sirius XM douches there.  And they're like, hey, you want to go to East Street Radio?  I'm like, no.  I'm broadcasting myself from my phone.  Radio.  Do I want everyone to like me or everybody to hate me?  That is true.  I'm not trying to make everyone hate me, but I'm real.  Why would I go on East Street Radio?  And then, then I sort of got the, like, inkling, all right, let me at least check it out.  If these guys are having a good time, maybe I could jump in and be a little silly, you 
[00:32:30]  know?  Right.  I'll go silly.  And, man, there was a guy sitting there, and I guess he's a big deal around here.  Screaming Bruce.  He's an older guy.  Bruce.  And his broadcast couldn't have been more boring.  He was talking to a lady about hunger.  I'm like, you're out of Springsteen show.  How about you get people pumped that might be listening to this shit in their cars?  Making more friends.  And then, to make a moment, he's talking about hunger, he's on the radio and he's got glasses  on, and he slowly pulls them off as he's talking about somebody that purposely didn't 
[00:33:00]  eat or something.  That's the exact moment that I said, I don't want to go on East Street Radio.  Yeah, because Sam goes, I'll go on East Street Radio.  I'm like, of course he would say that.  No, have fun, you fucking radio whore.  But then we would get chicken fingers.  That was better.  Wait, I just heard chicken fingers.  Yeah, I decided, you know, Roland set this up with me and him, and I guess Sam had to  be part of it, too.  I thought it was me and fucking Roland.  Sam had to be part of it.  Me?  You invited me?  Oh, yeah.  I had an extra ticket. 
[00:33:30]  My friend Fuzzy couldn't go.  You're right.  Oh, well.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, Sam.  And it wasn't even a request.  It was a demand.  It was a...  No, Roland fucking said, bring Sam.  No, I brought you.  It was cool.  I don't care.  I got a text from you, and all it said was, we going to Bruce tonight, though.  Yeah, I wrote, go.  That's all right.  A lot of dough.  A lot of dough.  But then it's on.  Sam did rock out, jumped up and down, screamed.  Yeah, but he was faking it.  He was just trying to make you happy.  He didn't even know that.  He had no idea what he was listening to.  Everybody bought it, though, around us.  But you had a good time if I was rocking out, right? 
[00:34:00]  I'm not going to be a party pooper.  If I'm down, I'm down.  Yeah, he was down.  But you were trying to bro out a little bit, and I'm not fucking down.  Oh, shit.  Were you trying to bro down?  Well, I'm going to bro down with Roland, yeah.  Bro down with Roland?  Those are people.  I'll bro down with Roland.  I'll bro down with Troy.  And then they're getting mad because I don't want to be a Bruce buddy.  I didn't want...  Everyone was wearing the same fucking t-shirt around us.  We had a bunch of us.  We're Bruce buddies.  I see that.  And our friend Noah's going to wear a Bruce t-shirt, too, and she's going to be a Bruce  buddy, too.  Noah's a big fan of the show, too.  Huge fan. 
[00:34:30]  Everyone's fans.  Bruce?  You're not going to get to be a Bruce buddy, though.  That's okay.  No, it's not for you.  It's okay.  I don't need the shirt.  I need my Rolling Stone shirts rolling.  That's kidding.  That he promised me weeks ago.  Bruce!  Bruce!  Holy mother of God.  Anything else before we move on from the Bruce show?  Yeah.  It came to September.  Yay.  Can we thank the guy?  Gil, yeah.  He's super nice.  We can thank Gil?  Yeah.  Gil is...  Amazing.  What is his job?  I don't know if you can say that.  Oh?  All I'll say is I thought Roland was bullshitting, but... 
[00:35:00]  I love that dude.  But this guy Gil is way up there in the Bruce Brickson organization.  And he's a massive fan of me and you.  Wow!  And used to listen to us at AAF, even.  He goes that far back.  And I thought Roland was bullshitting.  And the passes we were getting, I'm like, I was convinced we were going to be sitting  down with Bruce before the fucking show started.  We were getting closer and closer.  Really?  Fuck yeah.  We had the lounge passes.  I guess we're in something called E Street Lounge.  The Little Stevie's Lounge. 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  Well, then he moved us to the Little Stevie Lounge, which is better than the E Street Lounge,  I guess.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Everything's got to be Bruce related and named and...  Oh God.  I had delicious cocktail wieners.  Yeah?  With mustard.  The food again.  It's always about the food with you.  There's the sign.  Except for the...  There's the fucking sign in it.  Yeah.  The intrusive sign?  Yes.  Imagine if you're on the floor.  It's right in front of him.  You can't see the fucking guy.  That's good shit.  So, right on.  And what about that lady?  She's a fan.  She would love to hear her name today. 
[00:36:00]  Debbie.  Debbie rules.  Debbie's going to get me an amazing Yankees ticket.  She's super, super nice.  Isn't this great?  I asked her if the Phillies play the Yankees this year.  I don't know if that is happening.  But if that's the case, Debbie will be taking care of me.  I need some Sox games.  Some Yankees Ritz Sox games.  I'll take those.  Oh yeah.  Those are always fun.  July.  Hank goes first because he's the fan.  He's the fan.  But if she can take care of me after answering that, I'll take those two.  She'll take care of us at the same time.  Yeah.  Great.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  That kind of someone in there.  It's like knowing George Costanza during the Yankee years.  You know?  Nice.  I did a bunch of shit on my Twitter for the Springsteen show, if you care.  Oh.  Some audio, too.  Oh.  Taped our ride to the show.  Oh.  Taped a little something backstage.  Taped a little something 20 feet from Bruce.  Bruce.  Bruce.  Go to my Twitter if you want to check out more shit from the show.  O.B. Radio.  Cheap fucking plug.  Yes.  Are you done with your Bruce?  Anything else you want to add?  I just love Bruce. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  We all know.  We know you love Bruce.  Now, what does he do till September?  He'd like...  Overseas.  Yeah.  So this motherfucker is just touring for what?  An entire year?  The last tour was three years.  What?  How long is he up to now with this tour?  By the time he comes back to Midlife Stadium, it'll be a year.  That's in September?  Yeah.  Don't he just hang out at home?  You see his money on the road?  You see his house?  Why would you ever leave there?  What's he doing?  His house is amazing, the pictures I've seen over the years. 
[00:37:30]  I'm so excited.  Three nights at Midlife.  Yeah.  Being with the people.  This is his home.  But then he takes a bunch of years off in between.  Yeah.  But now that he's 62, he can't take too many years off in between, if you know what I mean.  He's got to push a few of these tours in now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if he's going to be doing this in his 70s.  You think he will?  Don't say that.  He looks healthy as shit, though.  Yeah, he does.  Fuck.  He crowd surfed, runs around during the show.  Crowd surfs.  Why is he doing that?  Because you can pet him like this, like this. 
[00:38:00]  You can feel his tight jeans on his muscular ass.  You might get a ball bag in your face, but...  No, you feel his back.  It's part of the experience.  You feel his muscly ass as you have.  Yes.  Keeping him up in the air.  Was it packed?  Oh, yes.  Packed.  Bullshit, yeah.  How many people?  Probably 20,000.  How many?  20,000.  Wow.  It's inside, you know.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Where the Devils used to play, so...  That's amazing.  And then he saw where he sold out three nights in my life, and that's like 100,000. 
[00:38:30]  Plus, he's smart with it.  He's got no stage, so you can literally seat the whole arena.  There's no blocks off seats.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, he doesn't need...  More money for Bruce right there.  Yeah.  He doesn't need this over-the-top stage like other bands feel like they do.  No, he just...  Something Keith Richards bitches about in his book.  Yeah, really?  I don't know if I've mentioned a lot about this book I read on vacation, but Keith Richards  fucking hates that Mick Jagger uses all those props.  He feels like they don't have to use that.  Yeah, we'll talk about Tanning Lady in a minute. 
[00:39:00]  It's beyond bizarre.  It looks like the old Bugs Bunny cartoons.  It looks like she's got blackface on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's put on blackface.  Yeah, that's how they would portray black people in Bugs Bunny cartoons.  That's what she looks like.  Holy shit.  She's fucking disturbed, man.  Oh, yeah.  She's a mental patient.  That kid should be taken away.  Absolutely.  Absolutely fucking literally.  Oh, my God.  What were you saying?  I don't know.  Bruce.  Bruce.  He was saying, Bruce, Bruce.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  So, Keith Richards, he got sick of the fact that Mick Jagger has all those inflatables.  They have a lot of balloons.  Oh, he don't like the big balloons.  And he pretty much, no, he said it.  He's like, it's covering up his insecurities.  I'm like, what?  Wow.  Mick Jagger has insecurities that he needs inflatables around him?  Isn't that amazing?  You know, but they have to go with the over-the-top fucking four-story stage or whatever the fuck  it is.  The big-titted woman.  Last tour, their stage elevated and went to the middle of the crowd and launched out.  Well, some of that's cool, but all that other stuff. 
[00:40:00]  Like, I mean, Bruce, he's been doing this, what, 40 years?  Yeah, probably.  And just a stripped-down stage.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there was nothing.  Literally.  And barely a light show, matter of fact.  He just walks on stage when the lights are up.  That's it.  Bruce talks with his music.  The whole band walks out, and you think they're going to, like, put down the lights or something  for him?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, he's just sort of, sort of even, the last guy that walks on stage.  What about U2's setup, too?  That's a giant fucking...  I'm a huge U2 fan, so I'm kind of torn there.  But, yeah, they go over the top of their stage. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  It's crazy, their stage setup.  They get ridiculous.  But Bruce just needs...  He just needs him.  He's just screaming, yeah!  And then he screams out to people, like, ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Does that really happen?  Yeah.  Because he's like, ah!  You're like, ah!  And he recognizes fans.  He knows, like, people that are there all the time.  Yeah.  He goes, stop following me to one couple.  And right there, that means they're going to go to a thousand more shows. 
[00:41:00]  Does he ever look at you with familiarity?  Once in Johnny Stadium, he looked down and looked at that, and then he said, you look like  a cartoon character like that.  You look like a cartoon character.  You look like a cartoon character?  He goes, cartoon character.  Like, ah!  Holy shit.  You are in love.  You're in love.  If he needs to cuddle, I'm there for him.  But he doesn't, he can't sing one Springsteen song, because that was one of the things I  taped yesterday on the way of the show.  He can't sing them now?  He doesn't even really know the words of any of the songs. 
[00:41:30]  Ah!  He knows, like, just really basic words of Springsteen songs.  There's so many shows.  I hear the music, but I don't have a recorder in front of me.  Sing one song before we go to break.  Go ahead.  And really try it, don't you?  Something we all know, too.  And try, don't stop.  Go as far into it as you can.  And when you tell me that, then I blank out.  You've gone to over a hundred shows.  You're wearing this shirt.  Sing one of the hits.  Glory Days.  There, I got it. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, no.  I had a friend.  Oh, yeah.  This is Bruce's biggest fan, by the way.  I had a friend who was a baseball player back in high school.  He could throw that speedball by and make it look like a fool boy.  Sound the other night at the Rosei bar.  I was walking in.  He was walking out.  We sat down and had a few drinks.  All he kept talking about was Glory Days.  Oh, shit.  Glory Days. 
[00:42:30]  Um, no.  I forgot.  He's terrible.  He's the biggest fan.  What's going on?  What happens?  You're the biggest fan, but you should know every word of even the obscure ones.  I do a concert, but then we have to.  I do a concert.  When you can sing along?  Yes.  Why is that?  Why can you sing every word when you're singing along with the band?  But then when you try to do it on your own, you can't remember the word.  I don't know.  I think that happens to a lot of us.  It's that split second where you're actually getting the words. 
[00:43:00]  You think?  Yeah, yeah.  You think that's what it is?  Yeah.  And then it's so much, it's very familiar, the line before the one that you're singing,  so you kind of know it.  It's prompting you.  But I've only done karaoke a few times, because even when the words are in front of me, I'm  like, I don't really remember how this goes.  Where the words go in the song.  But if I'm at the concert with the band, I'm singing like I'm a rock star.  It is.  That is the weirdest fucking thing. 
[00:43:30]  You're being prompted by the song itself, and I think that's why you kind of can sing  better in the car, with the radio and stuff like that, than you can with just the music  or no music.  You might have explained something.  Yeah, I think that's how it works.  Because I used to get the same thing.  Like, there was nothing more horrific than playing with a band, and then the song starts  up, the intro, I step up to the microphone, and all that's going on in my head is, I have  no idea what the first word is to this song.  Wow.  None idea.  I'm going to fucking stand here without a clue. 
[00:44:00]  And then the split second that I have to start singing, boom, it kicks in my head.  Because that's the moment that the song is prompting me.  But before that, I couldn't remember what the fuck the words were.  When I'm in those situations, which is a lot rarer than you, I look at all the members  of the band.  I don't even know when I'm supposed to start singing.  Hey, help me out here, guys.  Help me out.  I have no idea.  Oh, man.  It's frightening.  Then someone has to nod to me like, and go.  Oh, okay.  I'll try it now. 
[00:44:30]  And go.  Yeah.  Very scary.  Well, I want to thank you for a fine night.  I want to thank you for a free lunch.  I really have.  What?  Steve Leeds.  Oh, yeah.  He won a great lunch from Steve Leeds.  I want to fucking eat a lot.  I'm going to screw him.  Of course you are.  I'm going to don't frisk this.  This video is hilarious.  With the lion.  A little kid sitting against a glass enclosure, and there's a lioness behind the glass.  It's like at a zoo or something.  And this little kid's in this zebra-striped little snuggie-looking thing. 
[00:45:00]  And this lioness is trying to eat the child through the glass.  I mean, trying to fucking eat the kid.  And the kid doesn't know.  It's just sitting there smiling.  It's a great video.  Yeah, that's the viral video.  That's the one of the day.  Absolutely.  This is hilarious.  The kid's adorable, ready to get fucking ripped apart if it wasn't for that thin piece of glass.  What is it called on YouTube for the people out there?  Oh, come on!  Who fucked up?  Okay.  Why?  They still fucked it up.  Why?  It's fucking portrait mode. 
[00:45:30]  Don't do portrait mode.  You cossuckers.  Just turn the phone sideways.  How hard could that be?  That lion wants to eat that child so bad.  He's pawing at the glass.  He's tagging the glass.  Opening his mouth up.  Really wide.  And look at the kids just looking at them.  Holy shit.  What a great video.  Literally what?  Four inches of glass.  Yeah.  That kid would be a fucking tidbit.  It's called Lion at the Portland Zoo if you want to check it out at home.  Yeah, very funny.  We're putting it up on our Facebook page right now, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  I wonder if it's the zebra color of the little onesie the kids wear.  Oh, yeah.  Right on.  Maybe it looks like a little baby zebra.  Yeah, a little baby zebra.  Yeah, because it's definitely a black and white number.  How big that fucking lion opens its mouth and puts its mouth against the glass like,  I gotta bite this kid.  I gotta bite it.  What would your move be there?  What do you mean?  If there was no glass?  Yeah.  I'd watch a kid get eaten.  No, I mean if it was you.  Oh, if it was me?  There's nothing you could do.  You can't fight off a fucking lion.  You can't do it.  I'd go right for the balls and hope for the best. 
[00:46:30]  Really?  I think that's your only chance.  You can't go for the eyes.  Is that your strategy in any situation?  Go for the balls and hope for the best?  You know what?  A nice fucking knee to the balls takes care of a lot of problems.  I think you gotta try the eyeballs, but...  With a lion?  I don't know.  That's a lioness.  You're gonna have trouble finding the balls.  Oh, that was a lioness?  Yeah.  Yeah, the balls are gonna be tough to locate.  Can you punch her pussy?  You can punch her in the pussy.  What would that do to a lioness, you think?  I might bruise her pussy, but be on that.  How about you pull on her nipples?  That's not doing shit.  They fight with all the lions that grab their nuts and their pussies and their tits and their 
[00:47:00]  fucking...  It doesn't help.  You're done.  You're done.  Let me slow this down a little bit, because it's something we all can relate to.  You ever have a dog or a cat that grabs hold of you, right, and then just digs in with  their claws all at the same time?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you're like, holy fuck, does that hurt?  Yeah.  Imagine that with a lioness.  You're powerless to do anything.  You're hugging this thing, trying to fucking rustle it or something, and those back paws  get into you?  Oh, man, forget it.  Anything you're trying to do to defend yourself, she will just fucking eliminate with her teeth 
[00:47:30]  or claws.  There's nothing you can do.  It's fucking horrific.  It's a real, live monster.  That's why I laugh at human achievements.  I was thinking about this in the park the other day.  Yeah.  I saw some runners, and I'm thinking...  I used to be a runner myself, and I did okay.  I did all right as a runner.  But I'm thinking, like, we brag about all the records we set as runners and stuff, and  then these animals, like...  That's a trot.  Yeah, they laugh at it.  That's nothing.  But we, like, put ourselves on pedestals and give each other medals because you're the 
[00:48:00]  fastest man in the world.  Yeah.  It doesn't even come close to what an animal could do.  You ever see that explosive speed of a cheetah when it goes after some prey?  It's fucking amazing how that thing turns, and, like, the slow motion, you see the back  legs go in between the front legs, just about kick herself in the fucking chin, and then  straighten out again and just blast in speed.  Yeah.  And we're like, ha, yeah, I really fucking took off on that one. 
[00:48:30]  Did you see me run?  Yeah.  No.  You're a slow piece of shit in the animal kingdom.  You take away the fact that we think we're the center of the universe.  Yeah.  Like, if the universe is...  Whatever it is up there is looking down at Earth, they have to be laughing.  Like, you're fucking patting yourselves on the back because you think you're the fastest  man in the world.  But you know what?  There's probably thousands of species of animals easily that would make you look silly.  Let's see that cheetah build a fucking airplane, though.  I did break that into my thought process.  I'm like, okay, so what is it? 
[00:49:00]  It's like, okay, it's because we got these brains.  The brain thing.  You know, you go out on the Bonneville Salt Flats with a fucking jet car, you'd be kicking  ass on a cheetah.  That cheetah's going to be scratching his head.  That cheetah's going to be going, what the fuck is that?  Okay, fair.  So we've adapted machinery and stuff to help us out where we lack in our physical prowess,  like the cheetah and whatnot.  But to brag that, wow, he runs around the track real fast.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I try to break it down without the brain shit.  When we're just, yeah, you know, organically, us alone in the forest or on the plains of 
[00:49:30]  the Serengeti against animals, we're pretty fucked.  Yeah.  You put that lioness in with the best UFC fighters?  Oh, right.  Exactly.  I think that you see the UFC guy trying to tap on the lion.  The lion's just biting his fucking head off.  Let's see how tough Jon Jones really is.  Yeah.  Get in there with the lioness.  I'm tapping.  Ow.  Ow.  It's my arm.  How long would one of those guys last, you think, though?  Because they have some more moves that we don't.  Hilarious. 
[00:50:00]  UFC guy against a lioness.  A hungry lioness.  It would be the greatest pay-per-view ever.  Greatest.  And I guarantee that you could find a guy that would actually go for that.  You think you could choke out a lioness?  Is there any way to get a lioness on her back and you put that arm around and lock it in  and try to choke out the lioness?  I don't know what the move would be, but I guarantee there's a few fighters that would  actually take that match.  Try to take the match?  You're sitting around in the compound watching a UFC fighter versus a lioness? 
[00:50:30]  Here it is against the lioness.  Holy fuck.  All the prelims are over.  And now we're going to watch the guy fighting a fucking animal.  A fucking monster.  To the death.  Well, I...  It would have to be to the death.  You think?  Unless...  Why?  He taps and then what happens?  The ref's going to step in?  I'm just wondering if a UFC fighter would go agree to the death.  Yeah.  Wow.  You might have to take, you know, the lioness out at one point.  Yeah, a little trank dart in the neck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  A stun gun?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Cool match. 
[00:51:00]  Can't wait to see that one.  It would be...  I don't see that.  It would be awesome.  All right.  We're going to break and eat.  All right.  Who do we got today to help us through?  Jim Brewer?  No, it's Brewer's coming in, man.  You know, we haven't had a day off, Roland, and we're up to...  This is the 11th day in a row we've worked.  Wow.  Just want people to know that out there.  We're troopers.  Yep.  11 straight days.  Yeah.  So I don't want these guys bitching down the hall if we decide to take a personal day.  Oh.  Mine tomorrow.  I hear radio people have more days off than anyone else. 
[00:51:30]  Is that right?  What?  I hear radio people have more days off than, like, anyone else.  That's an easy job.  But still, we're...  We're not teachers.  Teachers?  Teachers have way more days off than us.  Do they?  Summertime.  Yeah.  Are they really off, though?  I don't know.  What?  Yeah, they are.  Yeah?  They just get paid and they're off?  Well, that's why...  Pretty good gig.  That's why their pay is a little low.  That's how it's justified.  Oh, really?  But you get, you know, three months, a year off.  Are they allowed to work during that summer?  Yeah, they all have a second job. 
[00:52:00]  They have to.  They have...  Can't be a stripper, though, or anything.  No.  You've got to be careful what your side job is.  Yeah, you've got to be really careful.  Running a meth lab in a fucking mobile home in the desert.  You've got to be careful what your side job is.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of those schmucks travel abroad in the summer.  Who's going to travel abroad?  I'm going to travel abroad.  I'm going to get a fellowship.  A fellowship.  What's a fellowship?  I don't know.  It's Lord of the Rings shit.  Or what that is.  I'm going to get my doctorate.  I'm a fellow.  At Oxford. 
[00:52:30]  I'm a fellow at Oxford.  Fellow.  Hello, fellow.  Getting my doctorate.  Fellas.  Let's eat some food, motherfucker.  Hey, look at girls, you're tired at home. 
[00:53:00]  Don't come and leave you all alone.  There's a bad design.  Oh, oh, oh, I'm a fan.  Tell me how it's really, it's good to you.  I'm a dude, he's the things I like.  And you, we got a few higher.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire. 
[00:53:30]  Sometimes I come in life.  Ah!  It's in the trash, but you know the world's in.  Ah!  Mm! 
[00:54:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire.  Thank you. 
[00:54:30]  Sirius XM, this is the Odeon Air 3 Show. 
[00:55:00]  I got to go to an ACDC show. 
[00:55:30]  When can we do that?  I've never been.  ACDC.  That's one of those bands I've never seen that I always wanted to see.  Yeah, I've never seen them either.  I don't know why the...  Is this because Brewer's coming in later?  Yeah, did we mention Brewer's going to be here soon? 
[00:56:00]  It's a big deal when Jim Brewer stops out by.  And Dana White at 9.30, so maybe we could ask him about the Lioness versus the UFC fighter pay-per-view.  I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't working on that as we speak.  He's trying to get a little respect for his sport.  Yeah, I think a Lion would really boost that up, the respect factor.  Ah, James Earl Ray.  James Earl Ray?  Broke out of jail 41 years ago today. 
[00:56:30]  He broke out of jail?  I guess.  For what, an hour?  Is that how long it was out?  I don't know.  Do you know?  I was watching the documentary, the MLK assassination documentary last night on Smithsonian.  It was really fucking cool.  They had a lot of archive film and audio of the actual police talking to each other right after the shooting.  Very cool.  And then James Earl Ray and how long it took him to actually get him.  I guess they got him in England. 
[00:57:00]  No.  They arrested him in England.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that either.  I thought they arrested him down the fucking street.  No, he ran off and took off in a white Mustang and they couldn't find him and then they finally arrested him like a couple weeks later, was it?  Of course.  Or no, maybe a month or it was, I think, MLK was shot in April.  They caught him in like June or something in London.  Wow.  Yeah, fucked up.  Of course he escaped in a white Mustang.  Yes, yes, that's all I was thinking. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I was.  But it was really a very cool documentary.  You know what?  I would like to check that out.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And then, of course, the people, because I tweeted that, I'm like, wow, it's a really good documentary.  It really kind of shows you what the mood of the time was and everything.  And everybody has to retweet and be like, you like the happy ending?  Is it a comedy to you, Anthony?  Shut the fuck up.  God, try to enlighten some people with a good documentary and they just have to throw in that shite. 
[00:58:00]  If you play it backwards.  Play Roots backwards and it's got a happy ending.  They all get back to Africa.  Right, right.  Do they?  You don't like that down and dirty stuff?  Is that what happened?  It's hack racism.  You know, if you keep your racism smart, people.  I'm all about if you're clever with something, I'm good.  But that's just in your face. 
[00:58:30]  There's nothing to it, shit.  Just fucking.  Don't tweet someone else with that crap, please.  Hey, Martin Luther King documentary.  Were you smiling the whole time?  Did you really get one of those?  Yes.  All of the ones I've been saying, I got last night after that.  It's like, really?  I'm just trying to fucking.  Oh, you should have saved your favorite ones and read them on the air.  Oh, man.  Well, they're exactly like that.  They're all just make up whatever hacky, racist thing you could say about watching an assassination documentary.  And they fucking tweeted it. 
[00:59:00]  I have one more thing about the Bruce Springsteen Show, if you will allow me, sir.  I want to thank the scumbag piece of shit fucking ticket taker on the train that almost threw me and Sam off.  Threw you off of the train?  What a piece of shit.  What happened there?  Obviously, it was a legitimate mistake.  I don't take New Jersey transit that much.  Yeah.  But the easiest way to go from Newark back to New York City is to jump on the train, the choo-choo, right? 
[00:59:30]  Right.  So we leave the show and we're in a big hurry because I got to wake up and I can't do what you do and Jimmy and what you and Jimmy do and stay up all night and come in here.  It's impossible for me.  Right.  I need a few hours.  So it was really crucial to get home and maybe get four or five hours sleep, which I did in the end.  So we're on the train.  Literally, the doors are closing.  So I'm like, let's go for it instead of getting our tickets, knowing that we were both very low in funds. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, very low.  But I'm thinking to myself, at the very least, I got a fucking credit card, don't I?  I got money.  Officially, I got money in my pocket.  It's called the credit card.  Oh, boy.  So a train takes off, guy comes by, and we're digging.  You know, I guess the ticket itself is five bucks.  Yeah.  But if you get it on the train, it's ten bucks.  Ah, they do that.  So technically, we had the original fare, five bucks.  I had seven, and I think Sam had six.  Look, I got to jump in here for a second. 
[01:00:30]  I was too scared to bring this up, because I can't even look at it yet.  No, it's...  But lately, I've had cash.  Lately, I have had cash.  You've got to go...  But you're going to an event that is away from your home.  You need cash when you leave.  I've left the house with, like, fucking three bucks in my pocket.  I know what that's like.  But if I know I'm going somewhere, I make sure I got some cash on me, too.  I had a little that I went through, and I also had a credit card.  Yeah, but Sam needed cash.  Credit card could pay for everything.  Yeah.  And I did ask if they had an ATM machine, but I don't know. 
[01:01:00]  We were too busy.  Oh, boy.  Wandering around that I didn't hit the ATM machine.  Oh, jeez.  So I look at the guy.  I'm like, look, we got the actual fare, five bucks each.  And he goes, well, there's a ticket machine in Secaucus.  You're going to have to get off the train to get your ticket and then wait for the next one.  In Secaucus.  Oh, shit.  I don't know what the fuck's going on in Secaucus at 11 o'clock at night.  Apparently people buying tickets.  And I don't know if, like, the next train is right behind the one we're on or if it's  one of these weird things where maybe it's an hour. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  So I look at the guy, legit, and I go, is there anything else we could do?  We have credit cards.  Yeah.  Like, obviously this is a mistake.  You know when someone's trying to fuck you over, but this is a legitimate mistake.  Nope.  Oh, boy.  Get off at Secaucus in the middle of the night.  Thank you.  So then we're like, fuck.  And I'm digging in every pocket.  I'm wearing a coat.  I got extra zippers. 
[01:02:00]  I'm looking everywhere.  I'll tell you what I would have done.  What would you have done?  I would have said, Sam, give me your money.  I'm buying my fucking ticket.  Get the fuck off.  You get your ass off in Secaucus and get a fucking ticket.  Because let's not forget, you're still the help at this point.  Right.  Exactly.  You're still the help.  You're helping me out, motherfucker.  That's right.  I was a guest.  Guest.  So then, luck would have it.  When we were in Cleveland, these guys were going to the strip club.  Remember I told you I was debating in the lobby, and the last second I was like, I'm  too tired.  Uh-huh.  But I did hand over as a goof to Kenny, here's $20, enjoy yourself. 
[01:02:30]  Wait, is that how that went?  No, you said...  Or I gave it to you?  You said, Kenny, give the kids some money.  And then Kenny gave them to $20.  Right.  Because I knew these guys don't make a lot of money.  So I go to Kenny, you're right.  If they're going to the strip club, give him some money.  And of course, Kenny's going to fucking charge me and then service fees.  Well, yeah, of course.  Handling charge, whatever the fuck he adds to his...  So he peels off a $20 and hands it to Sam as a goof. 
[01:03:00]  Sam, of course, doesn't see goofs and grabs it immediately.  Of course he does.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it worked in our favor because then Sam is digging through his coat and finds the  $20 and goes, this is the fucking $20 that was technically from you, from Cleveland.  So then this scumbag fucking piece of shit ticket holder comes by with an attitude, because  now we're in Secaucus.  He's like, so what?  What was his exact words?  What are we doing, guys?  What are we doing, guys?  Wrap, wrap, wrap on the seat. 
[01:03:30]  What are we doing, guys?  Oh, man.  So then we pull out the $20, and I think he was almost disappointed that he couldn't  kick us off the fucking train.  Ah, see?  You had a lot of love for that.  In Secaucus, so we could hit a ticket machine.  He'd have loved that.  Kick your ass right out.  Why don't they have credit card machines, man?  Technically, he had money.  And then I told Sam, I'm like, look, if we get off at Secaucus, fuck that machine shit.  We'll run.  I was going old school with my thinking.  We're going to run to the back of the train and get back the fuck on. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, that's a good idea.  Because how much money could it cost from Secaucus?  That's a good idea.  But we're going to have to do that.  Whew.  Because I had the $20 from the strip club.  Right.  Because I wasn't going to spend it on a girl.  You'll never see that $20 again.  That's gone.  That's gone.  Well, that was my $20.  No, no.  It wasn't your $20, but I understand that it's gone, but it wasn't your $20.  That was my $20.  And by the way.  It was given to me.  That was my $20.  No, it wasn't.  By the way, Sam fucking knew he had that $20 the whole time. 
[01:04:30]  I didn't know I had the $20 the whole time.  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  You were going to allow us to get kicked off a train at Secaucus?  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  You had a $20 in your pocket?  No, I didn't.  You fucking knew you had that $20.  No, I didn't.  Because Sam knows every dime he has.  He knew he had that $20.  He just wanted to wait until the last minute and see if there was another solution besides  handing it over to you.  I was looking at my socks for money.  You think that's what he was doing?  Yes, you did, Brett.  No.  Yes, you did.  When you realized legitimately I had no more money on me, that's when you decided, oh, 
[01:05:00]  fuck, I got to pull this out.  I found it in my inside jacket pocket.  I had no idea there was a $20 in there.  You were going to allow us to get kicked off the train instead of taking that $20 out.  I didn't want to get off in Secaucus even at last minute.  I don't know what the fuck happens in Secaucus.  So hold the phone.  How did you even find the $20 then?  It was in my inside jacket pocket.  And you were going through your jacket pocket?  You were just going hoping maybe you had some money?  We were scrambling through every pocket on our person.  We were.  We got a conductor in. 
[01:05:30]  He knows he had that pocket.  I didn't have it.  We got Sal in Jersey.  Sal, regular to the show.  Hey, yeah.  What's up, Sal?  Hey, listen.  Hope, you got to give us a break.  You know how many times we hear that story, we ain't got no money, we're running late?  Yeah, that's true.  Every day, at least a thousand times on every train.  All this guy had to do was look at me and he knows I'm good for it.  Plus, we give him the $13.  We had $13.  We give him the $13.  We've given him every dollar in our pocket.  It was, yeah, $13.  And technically, it's a $10 fare for two people. 
[01:06:00]  It's that huge fucking over-the-top charge because you decide you have to buy the ticket on a train.  That's the stupidest thing ever, by the way.  But that's not our fault.  That's New Jersey Transit's fault.  Well, they suck.  To be honest with you, they suck.  If it tickets five bucks, who the fuck cares where you fucking get it?  Well, because if we don't enforce that rule, everybody would be buying that on a train.  Aw, too bad.  Then you guys would actually have a job to do.  Aw.  Instead of hole punching. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, I'm a hole puncher.  Too fucking bad.  And then on top of it, why isn't it a dollar charge or maybe two?  It's twice because you decide to get it on the train?  Wait a minute.  Do you think that we make that price?  Well, I got to kill somebody over this, right?  I think so.  You killed the messenger.  Yeah, but who cares if you got to, you know, write, you got to, you know.  I bet the messenger just takes the $13 and has a good night.  Hey, look, if it was me, I would have gave you a break. 
[01:07:00]  I would have said, don't do it again, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, this guy.  You would have been better off if you were a pretty girl, to tell you the truth.  Well, this guy was a big cock about it.  He was like, oh, okay, I get it.  You got a little power over us and you're going to take advantage and have fun with it, are you?  Over a lousy, it would have been, we were short technically seven bucks.  Oh, okay.  What, you're going to cause a huge scene and make sure we're kicked off the train in Secaucus?  The guy was a cock.  He really was, because I looked at him like, is there anything else we could do here? 
[01:07:30]  Because, you know, obviously we don't have the money, but we have credit cards.  Yeah.  You guys don't have a credit card machine?  You know, when it comes down to a desperate situation, just get one of those swipers for your iPhones.  Yeah, yeah, they should be able to do that.  They're working on it.  They're working on it.  Oh, what year is it?  Oh, that's right, 2012.  2012.  2012, 2012.  Yeah.  Listen, it's not a hassle for you guys if you're, you know, having people purchase tickets on the train. 
[01:08:00]  It's not that much of a hassle.  They just figured out a way to make even more money from us.  That's what it comes down to.  It was the train.  Huh?  How many people were in that train?  Honestly, because we left a little early, it wasn't bad at all.  It was, it was, well, plenty of seats.  Okay.  Well, then, like I said, you know, I always accept the situation and work accordingly.  But you got to understand, you hear that excuse a million times. 
[01:08:30]  It's like if you have to meet your boss and it gives you the same excuse over and off.  At some point, you're just tired of hearing that same old song and dance.  Yeah, but I think you got to, all right, maybe, I have a feeling this guy doesn't fucking give anyone a break.  Maybe I wasn't the guy that, you know, was going to get the break that night.  But this guy looked like the type of guy that doesn't give anyone a break.  And every once in a while, you got to see the situation and go, okay, I got it.  I'm going to take care of this person.  Plus, we had 13 crumbled up singles in our hands.  Yeah, we technically had the original fare. 
[01:09:00]  13 crumbled up singles.  We got this much, this many.  Yeah.  I think there's a couple of people at fault here.  Yeah, go ahead.  I think New Jersey Transit sucks dick.  Thank you.  And I also think you guys are a couple of cheap motherfuckers that should have had cash on you when you go to fucking Jersey.  I didn't do shit.  I don't have the cash.  There you go.  There you go.  All right, Sal, I love you.  I love you, Sal.  I blame Sal.  If you would have made it to me, I would have recognized you.  You would have been on the house.  I wouldn't even...  You better recognize. 
[01:09:30]  Recognize.  Yeah, we should have went into the bathroom, man.  We should have went all to school together at the same time.  Hide in the bathroom.  The guy would be knocking.  Secaucus!  Get out of Secaucus!  Oh, this guy couldn't wait when we got into Secaucus to be right in front of us.  Yes.  And what did he say again?  He said, what are we going to do, guys?  What are we going to do, guys?  Well, I guess we're going to get off the fucking train in Secaucus because you're a big fucking asshole.  Yeah.  That's what we're going to do, sir.  Do you know what New Jersey Transit tells us to do? 
[01:10:00]  No.  To call the police on you guys.  Actually have you removed off the train by the police.  You know what?  Wow.  The police love us.  I dare him.  Oh, shit.  Oops.  Daring.  I dare.  I got PBA cards out the asshole.  Well, and I'll find this.  How about some money?  Keep the PBA cards at home and just take some cash with you.  Next time, just bring a 20 instead of the PBA cards.  All right.  I can't believe you travel with, like, no money.  I even said it to Sam because I was embarrassed. 
[01:10:30]  I'm like, I swear I have money on me lately.  Did I leave the house?  No, I didn't.  I really have money lately.  All right.  How much money you got on you right now?  $20.  As we speak.  How'd you get that 20?  My sister wouldn't take it.  I was trying to pay for something, and she left it for me when I got home yesterday.  I still got the six.  Huh?  And you got the six.  I got the six.  So.  No, I know, man.  Look.  Don't break how much money you got.  It's $850. 
[01:11:00]  They make $100 bills?  You just got to have money on you because you never know.  Why do you, uh.  But that's too much, I think.  No, it's not.  $800?  It's not too much.  No, it's too much to have in cash.  I have a credit card.  I can buy whatever the fuck I want.  It's not, though.  Why?  We don't use cash as much in this society.  You never know.  You just never know.  $800 worth, though?  $800.  Why not?  What happens if you don't have $800?  What?  I honestly, and this is the truth, I carry about $200 at all times. 
[01:11:30]  About.  Whoa.  I'm Mr. G-Man.  That's my pocket money.  I'm good.  $200 is good for me.  I carry a cold G with me.  You guys are rich.  A G.  And don't try to rob me, motherfuckers.  I will shoot you.  And I will perform some karate.  Oh, I thought oral sex.  I will perform oral sex to keep you.  Whatever it takes to keep my own money, god damn it.  Oh, man.  No, because I put everything on my credit card, and I got a couple hundred bucks, I guess, 
[01:12:00]  just in case, here and there.  But I never feel like I need more than that.  You guys are loaded.  I just think if it comes down to...  But I certainly did not have that last night.  It comes down to things like, I don't know, there's just certain times where you need a  bunch of cash.  I have between $6 and $14 on me at all times.  Right.  Everyone thinks you knew you had that $20.  I mean, there's not a person listening.  I know he knows.  Look, look.  Here's Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  You saw me go through my pockets eight times.  And I went, oh, fuck.  I got to pull this $20 out.  See? 
[01:12:30]  You knew it.  Because I don't feel like getting off in Secaucus.  I know he knew it.  Bill, what's up?  You don't know anything.  You don't know Jack.  Hey, guys.  I'm speaking for all this.  It's not for one fucking second.  We didn't think that Cheapscape Sam, that Converse-saving motherfucker didn't have that  $20 on him.  I didn't know I had $20 on him.  Bill, you can speak for as many people as you want.  Oh, Bill.  You weren't on a train yesterday.  I know he knew he had that $20.  Oh, bitch, Sam.  You're cheap.  You knew you had that $20.  He's too cheap to not know.  He knew he had the $20. 
[01:13:00]  You know why he's cheap?  Because the $20 bill that I gave him in Cleveland for a strip club, he didn't  spend in a strip club.  Think about that.  Right.  Why didn't you spend $20 in the strip club?  I don't like girls.  I don't like girls.  He was trying to bro down with somebody.  Exactly.  I thought we were going to hang out with the fellas.  He was broing down.  Get out of there.  How did you get away with not spending that in the strip club?  That's a good question.  Because.  Because it really is the same $20.  Because, number one, they waived our admission.  Yeah.  Number two, I don't drink.  Soda.  Soda pops. 
[01:13:30]  I didn't drink anything.  That would be two soda pops in Cleveland.  No, it would be $10 because Kenny and me buy our soda pops from the gift shop and then  bring them into the bar.  Oh, did you hear this?  Yeah.  I heard that one.  They decided to save money and get their Cokes.  I know I'm going to read this.  Across the hallway.  Just so people hear this.  Across the lobby.  It's $10 Dr. Peppers.  Then they sit in the hotel bar with their Coca-Colas.  Right.  That they bought in the gift shop.  And how much money did you end up saving?  Well, because you ask for a large glass of, Kenny asked for two large glasses of ice. 
[01:14:00]  And then you get, out of the 20-ounce bottle that's only $2, you get like two and a half  large glasses.  Each?  Out of each bottle.  Which is going to be probably $4.  So it's like $10.  So you're saving $8.  Each.  And GH.  Yeah, but you're away.  Anybody can drink Coca-Cola.  Me and Sam are fancy.  We drank Dr. Pepper.  Dr. Pepper.  And to everyone out there who's like, oh, Sam, you're a cheapskate. 
[01:14:30]  Club Soda, why don't you tell them all who treated you to a beverage?  Sam did treat me, but I think he was trying to get into my pants.  He wanted to bro down with you?  Yeah.  But it was $2, Sam.  That's not treating.  It was $4, because I got one, too.  Four total.  And I got...  Four total.  Yeah.  Four dollars.  And then he asked for a cup of ice.  No, no.  A glass.  A large glass.  A large glass.  Would you give the waitress a tip?  No.  No gratuity. 
[01:15:00]  Not only did he not give her a tip, he made a joke about cancer after he heard that her  mom had cancer.  I did hear about that.  Right, right.  Jesus.  What else are you supposed to do?  Terrible.  Cleveland.  What are we doing?  It's Cleveland.  Yeah.  They bought fucking Dr. Pepper.  But even when I was poor, I didn't have that in my mindset to do stuff like that.  I would have just went to...  Did she look at you like that you brought your own fucking Dr. Pepper's in?  Yep.  I didn't notice.  Yeah.  She was so insignificant to me. 
[01:15:30]  Kenny and I walked in there with no shame and two bottles of Dr. Pepper.  Yeah.  And asked for some ice.  All right.  Yeah.  Just have a little nightcap.  Yeah.  But I didn't know there was a 20 in my pocket.  No?  No.  All right.  Oh, that fucking guy.  Yeah.  It was just the way he did it.  I hear what Sal's saying.  I'm sure they hear that shit a lot, but it was just the way this guy did it.  Yeah.  He was such a prick.  He was obviously...  A miserable prick.  You can tell he hates his life. 
[01:16:00]  We're not telling a story because if we were making it up, it would have been made up  just to save $7.  We weren't trying to save the whole fare.  Just take the $13 then.  Yeah.  Take what we got.  Take it for yourself.  Technically, it's $5 a piece.  So, you know, fuck the surcharge bullshit.  Right.  You could probably punch a certain hole on that stupid ticket that covers you, and let's  move on.  And besides that, it's just him.  Yeah, we weren't.  So take the $13, put it in your pocket, and don't even give us tickets.  I'm sure they hear the I have no money speech.  We actually had most of it.  $13 big ones.  $13 out of the $20 is pretty impressive. 
[01:16:30]  And just to add a caveat to Sam's strip club story, I did try to negotiate a lap dance for  him.  The girl offered a lap dance for $20, and I told her that was too much money for her.  Oh, that's a good negotiation tactic.  Tell her she's too ugly to give $20 to.  I didn't say that.  Well, that's what you meant.  Too much for you.  Too much for you.  Maybe your friend over there.  Right.  And aren't you glad we didn't get that lap dance because... 
[01:17:00]  You would have been out in Secaucus.  We would have still been in Secaucus right now.  Yeah.  What happens in Secaucus?  Is that a safe area?  Well, I told Sam what to do next time he gets in a situation like that.  What?  What?  What did you tell me?  Blow the conductor.  Yeah, that is what he said.  Is it really?  Yeah, he said, I just know.  Take the conductor into the bathroom.  Yeah, blow the conductor.  He had a serious twink just sucking cock for fucking tickets.  And then I knew there was a $20 in my pocket the whole time.  I just wanted to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, as you're blowing him, you take the $20 out and wave it in your fingers at his face. 
[01:17:30]  Hello.  I had the money.  I had it the whole time.  It's always an adventure when we get together.  Ah, always something going on.  All right, well, Danny brought some audio to the show.  He was laughing so hard in the office this morning.  Over this?  Yeah.  And he couldn't really explain it to us.  He was just sitting there with his headphones on.  Come down.  It's 5 o'clock in the morning and Danny's just sitting there with his headphones on, giggling  to himself.  None of us can hear what he's laughing at.  It says, psychic can change shape of clouds. 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  And I go, what does this mean?  And he goes, I...  And he tried to explain it and he was laughing.  He was giggling the whole morning.  Yeah.  Danny, this one cracks you up, huh?  Yeah.  If I could just, uh...  Where's my headphones at?  Uh-oh.  If I could just tag that cheapo story about these two at the bar.  Oh, with, uh...  Sam and Kenny.  Cheapo story.  Buying their own Dr. Pepper.  No, no, no, no.  Not buying their own. 
[01:18:30]  I bought them for both of us.  I wanted to get some room service beers.  Right.  But they were, uh...  I get room service closes at what I thought was 3 a.m.  But apparently, like, where they get the beer from is like that little store where I guess  you guys got the sodas.  That's right.  But they close at 1.  So I called for beers and there's no beer.  So now I had to go down to the bar and get beer.  So they're trying to save money on Dr. Pepper.  I went down to the bar.  I bought a six-pack of bar beers.  Oh, fuck.  How much is worth it?  30 bucks. 
[01:19:00]  Probably for the six beers.  And then I tipped the bartender a 20.  You tipped her?  Absolutely.  50 bucks for a six-pack.  For a six-pack.  You got ripped.  Yeah, but I wanted to drink some beers and I used to work on tips, so...  And he's chilling.  It's like you're sort of on vacation.  You're having a good time so you don't think about all that dumb stuff.  Yeah, I don't care.  Like, it's...  You know what?  What was I going to do?  Not have some beers?  Like, fuck it.  You know what would maybe not have a good time on vacation?  What?  $50 for six beverages.  But I was...  You know what?  I was...  I didn't... 
[01:19:30]  I planned on paying for the hotel, but now it's going to get picked up.  So the way I see it is, well, I was going to spend that money anyway.  Yeah, you're still ahead of the game.  I am ahead of the game.  I feel that way.  And you bought a $40 Springsteen shirt so you could be a Bruce Buddy.  You're never going to wear that shirt again.  You say, well, we'll be Bruce Buddies again.  You're never going to wear that shirt again.  Well, you might see it once in the next year, maybe.  I'll wear it again.  I'll wear it now.  I'll wear it a lot of times.  I don't see you wearing your Lady Gaga shirt all that much anymore.  I'll wear that tomorrow.  You want to be Primus buddies with me?  Can't do it now.  No.  Primus?  You're going to go see Primus?  Again, yeah. 
[01:20:00]  May 19.  Let's go.  You're like fucking rolling with proofs.  Yeah, a little bit.  It's becoming that.  You really like seeing Primus, huh?  Dude, it's a great show, man.  It's just a great show.  A lot of times, it's just them.  You don't have to sit through some shitty opening band.  You just go.  You show up.  It's what you want to see.  They put on a great show.  It's hard to complain.  Yeah, Primus is all right.  It's very hard to complain.  We played a bunch of those songs.  There's not this long, boring chunk where everybody's going to get drinks.  They just do a solid show for two hours.  Here's the dumb question. 
[01:20:30]  Are they still putting out new material?  Because I have no idea.  They just put out their last album, Green Naugahyde, selling pretty well.  And I mean, look, their popularity kind of came back because for a long time, you were  like, where the fuck are they?  Yeah, yeah, true.  And they broke up for a while, but all of a sudden, they show up.  They start playing gigs, and they sold out the Brooklyn Waterfront, and I mean, there  were thousands of people there, and it was just like, holy shit.  Who knew?  Will they play Mrs. Blalene?  Maybe.  That's a good one.  Maybe I'll go to that show.  That's a fucking great song.  Why is that a good song?  Bring a 20 with you.  I like that song.  Yeah, it was...  Mrs. Blalene. 
[01:21:00]  It's a pretty creepy song, too.  It's a song in like 7th grade.  Yes, it's awful.  Can I ask you a technical question?  How do you get that sound?  Are they loose strings?  Like, how...  Well, yeah, it's a combination of his equipment and his technique.  It's a lot of slapping and popping.  It just feels like the string itself is a little looser or something.  Well, bass string is loose.  Yeah, no, I get it.  But that sound is so unique to Primus. 
[01:21:30]  He's one of the only...  I mean, and that's why I love Primus so much, because, you know, a lot of these bands, they  evolve and they change and they become something else.  But Primus is Primus is Primus.  And to this day, I've started listening to them in like 93, whenever The Hell Fork Soda came out.  I've never heard anything like it still.  I've never heard anything like it.  It's very fucking catchy.  Dr. Gay?  No, just to tag on to that.  Dr. Gay!  A lot of tagging on to things for that.  Dr. Gay!  Uh, talking about like...  They called him!  Dr. Gay! 
[01:22:00]  Dr. Gay!  Guys, please, please, Mrs. Blainley...  That was a fun part of Cleveland.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Dr. Gay!  The whole crowd yelling out, Dr. Gay!  What, did you like that?  That was a fun part.  That was an homage.  Did I tell you what they yelled at Troy when he walked in?  I mean, I did.  I don't remember.  We were all walking in.  It was like me, Troy, and Roland.  And there's a whole line of fans.  And they were like,  Yeah, Sam!  Yeah, Roland!  And we're like,  Hey, how's it going?  And one guy goes,  Hey, Troy!  And Troy raises his hand,  and the guy goes,  Nice hipster shoes, faggot! 
[01:22:30]  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  Oh, nice hipster shoes, faggot!  Oh, so Danny, what's this clip about?  Well, the psychic.  There's a guy, and apparently he feels that he can shape clouds with his mind and his psychic abilities.  Right.  And it's not so much him or what he's doing that makes the video excellent.  It's just the way, I guess, he walks you through what he's doing. 
[01:23:00]  Should we have the video up?  It doesn't really matter, to be honest.  You can if you want to get it.  But I was just watching it in the morning, and I was about to bail on it until he starts his process of trying to do this whole shape-shift thing.  I had to watch it like a thousand times.  I was laughing my claws off.  I hope the setup's good enough, because now when it flops, I'm going to feel like a big douche.  But, man, at five in the morning, this is making me laugh pretty hard.  Okay.  It's not going to go well.  So some douchebag trying to shape clouds.  Yeah, you know, he thinks he could.  Obviously, it's just the wind, and he's just insane in his own brain thinking that he's actually making something happen to these clouds. 
[01:23:30]  This is a weather control, psychic cloud control video by T-Chase.  See this cloud?  I make videos where I'm able to control clouds by my psychokinesis, psychic power.  I'm making this in, recording this September 2010. 
[01:24:00]  Okay, this guy's crazy.  See this cloud?  See this cloud?  I'm going to try to turn this cloud into a square-shaped cloud.  Make this cloud into a square-shaped cloud.  Square.  By psychic power, turn it into a square-shaped cloud.  He's surrounded by dead hooker parts.  Cloud, become a square-shaped cloud.  Get the fuck out of here.  Cloud, become a square-shaped cloud.  Cloud.  I hate how he says square. 
[01:24:30]  Square.  Square.  Clued.  So his psychic abilities are just asking the cloud to change?  Yeah.  I was already on board with him before that.  Just the way his regular speak was great.  But this is just even better.  Square.  Clued.  Clued.  Clued.  Become a square-shaped cloud. 
[01:25:00]  Clued.  Become a square-shaped cloud.  Clued.  Clued.  Clued.  become a square-shaped turn into a square-shaped clued clued  turn into a square-shaped clued turn into a square-shaped clued clued become a 
[01:25:30]  square-shaped clued clued become a square-shaped clued oh my god  Is it becoming square?  Turn into a square shape, Claude.  It's like Family Guy. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, he's breathing heavy.  I had to leave it in.  It was too good.  See the clouds becoming more of a square shape?  Claude.  Become a square shape, Claude.  Claude.  Claude.  Claude.  Everybody who just heard that has to have that running through their head for the rest of the day.  Claude. 
[01:26:30]  Claude.  My goal for today is to, I'm pulling the jimmy today, and everyone later today will be running around their apartments.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going, Claude, turn into a square shape, Claude.  Every cloud I see later on today, I'm just going to be going, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude.  Claude, Claude, Claude.  So, I don't know.  Does he have more videos?  Well, yeah, he must, because he prefaces it by saying, like, he makes videos of Claude.  You know what, though?  Well, he's got a whole list of them.  I might have to go and review more of his videos.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Well, it did turn into a Claude.  Claude.  It was more.  It was squooshy.  It did turn into a Scroude.  That guy's fucked up.  How does he do it, do you think?  Psychokinesis.  No, he does the audio after the fact.  Psychokinesis.  He sees what the cloud becomes, and then he does it.  Psychopathy.  Oh, you know, no, you know what?  I don't think so, because...  There he is.  That's the guy.  Because you heard, like, the wind and everything.  I think he was...  I know, but maybe just...  Instead of trying to alter the course of a speeding car, I'm going to post...  Huh?  I don't think that's the same guy. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know.  I have to look at his YouTube handle, but...  Cube.  Cube.  Cube.  I don't know.  Sometimes you just come across those...  There's nothing specifically funny, but it's just like, I don't know why I love this so  much.  Oh, my God.  I just don't know why I love it.  It's great.  I love that.  Cube.  I'm going to play this, like, three or four times today.  Cube.  Do a squishy.  A squishy.  Cube.  What a fucking...  It's almost like a Stalker Patty thing going on.  Yeah.  Just like...  A squishy.  Cube.  And it's like a... 
[01:28:00]  Cleared.  A clean.  Oh, super sweet.  Shut up.  God, I hate that.  Now.  You don't like her acting in that?  I have good hygiene.  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  Oh, my God.  I fucking forgot.  I fucking forgot.  Danny's got a really good Patty story.  Oh, my God.  I gotta get these voicemails.  Yeah, dude.  My dad, right?  Oh, no.  He works out...  You got voicemails of Patty?  Yeah, dude.  She's retarded.  It's fucking fantastic.  Yeah, we don't understand why she's such a huge fan of this show.  I have no idea.  You know what she does, though?  I think she's a little smarter than she leads people on with, because she knows that she 
[01:28:30]  can get stuff because she's Patty, like she's Stalker Patty, so people will give her  a little more rope, I guess.  Yeah, you know, so she was shopping.  They feel sorry for her.  They take care of her.  Yeah, so she was shopping around for her laptop, so my dad helps her out.  My dad makes the mistake of giving her his number.  Uh-oh.  So now Patty's fucking leaving voicemail.  Yeah, kid, kid, kid, my laptop.  And like, dude, it just goes on forever, and she's legit retarded.  Like, she's completely fucking retarded.  I want to hear that.  Yeah, I can't...  Dude, I completely forgot.  She's probably asking, like, difficult questions. 
[01:29:00]  Believe me, I don't even want to ruin it for you, but I've got to make sure I get this.  I forgot about it a few weeks ago.  Please get that.  I've got to get it.  Yeah, and apparently there might be more than one, too, so...  Clip to a square sheep.  How does he say square?  Because I'm going to do...  Square sheep.  That's right.  Square sheep.  I see Jim Brewer walking around outside the studio, so...  Jim Brewer, by the way, shares the picture wall with you guys now in the lobby.  Ooh.  Ooh!  Oh!  Who did they knock out? 
[01:29:30]  I guess...  I think Book Lady got knocked out.  You notice they're not rotating our picture out of that.  You're never leaving that wall.  You notice that, right?  Never.  That's why we bitch.  We get things done, motherfuckers.  Best fucking not.  Remember they said, oh, all right, we'll put you in the rotation?  I noticed we haven't been rotated out once.  They've taken a lot of people off that wall.  They know better.  Jim Brewer next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the Opinion Anthony Show. 
[01:30:00]  Fucking Brewer is in studio.  Jim Brewer.  Playing the heavy metal comedy Saturday at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey.  I don't think I've seen you since I went and saw you there.  I had the big, stupid beard.  Is that where you were?  No.  Oh, you came to see me up in Nyack.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Palisades.  Palisades.  What was it?  Yeah, Levity Live.  I haven't seen you since then.  We had a fucking blast up there.  That was really good.  You got to try the meatballs.  That's all they shoved down your throat.  The meatballs.  You got to try the meatballs, Jimmy.  This ain't no regular comedy club.  And fresh chocolate chip cookies.  Fresh.  And we were howling in the fucking dressing room to the point, I think you were late to  go on stage.  Yeah, what were we cackling about?  You fucking, this guy, you have so many. 
[01:31:00]  Didn't he have my kids there or something?  No, no.  No.  We were talking about houses burning down in the Outer Banks.  Oh, yeah.  I never told that story.  Good God.  That's hilarious.  And I'm thinking to myself, fuck your material.  This guy could just go on stage and just, for example.  I want to do storytelling.  And just tell the burning down, the house burning down story from the Outer Banks.  That was great.  I almost burnt down the entire Outer Banks.  Oh, man.  Could you tell, do you mind? 
[01:31:30]  Not at all.  Because I was howling.  This is great Long Island, South Shore, white trash, heading to another state and haven't  been out in a while.  Every year, for like two years in a row, I would rent two houses down on the Outer Banks.  And I'd rent it so far, I'd rent it as far north as possible.  So you have to go on the Outer Banks and then drive on the beach.  The 4x4 beach.  The 4x4 beach.  That's where I get my house every summer. 
[01:32:00]  Because I have so many heavy drinkers in my family, I didn't need them driving around  in North Carolina all night.  So we would go at the far north end of the beach where the fence was to get into Virginia.  It's at the actual border.  Right there.  I was at the border.  So I have two houses and there's nobody near me.  So they get as loud as they want.  Matter of fact, the first night, now we had the kid house.  And we have the do-whatever-you-want house. 
[01:32:30]  Of all people, everyone in the do-whatever-you-want house is usually 50 and over.  Right.  They don't even get off there.  I don't think any of my sisters saw the beach that week.  Oh, really?  I swear to God.  The beach is literally right in front of you.  It's 40 yards.  It's wild horses there.  Both my sisters never even stood up.  They just yearned.  Cut a urine hole on a bench. 
[01:33:00]  Peed.  Drank jugs of wine.  Smoked 4,000.  My one sister's married to the big, thick German.  He starts drinking Heineken at nine with eggs.  And so the first night we go to bed, and it's like 11 o'clock at night.  And for down there, that's about 4 a.m.  11 o'clock at night is 4 a.m.  Because you start early, you drink all day, you go swimming, you see dolphins, horses. 
[01:33:30]  It's a big, long day.  So at the end of the night, I hear this music.  What is going on?  I look in the next house, and there's these guys playing guitar.  I know no one in my family plays instruments.  Who's at their house playing guitars?  These fucking yo-yos were so loud.  The locals were like, hey, man, someone's having a big party.  And they came out of the woods. 
[01:34:00]  Now, you've got to see the locals down there.  Oh, man.  This is where convicts live.  The houses right next to the ocean are fucking beautiful.  Elevators, pools, you name it.  But you go in the backwoods, which is right there toward the Bay Area, and it's fucking.  They're convicts.  I'm convinced they're making moonshine and crystal meth and all sorts of shit back there.  And there's slavery still going on.  Deep in the woods there.  Without a doubt, hands down, something's going on.  So anyway, it's locals. 
[01:34:30]  It's just partying our brains off.  Now, before we get there, I usually rent a week with my family.  And then a week before that, I get my friends from Long Island.  So why don't we go there before my family comes?  Now, it's Fourth of July week.  So as we're going down, we stop in Virginia.  Oh, yeah.  And I think we must have dropped, I'm not even exaggerating, probably $1,000.  A lot.  Easy.  For south of the border.  Easy.  $1,000 in fireworks. 
[01:35:00]  Fuck.  Now, we get to North Carolina, we're all hopped up for, we haven't had a display like this  since 1978's block party, Jefferson Avenue, the big fire walk off.  This was a huge event.  There's no trees to interrupt.  This is great.  Perfect.  Now, whenever you go down there, have you ever been down there Fourth of July?  No.  No, I always go in August.  It's better than the Hudson River.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  And it's all local, shooting these things all over the water.  So it clearly says everywhere, don't even, every sign, every turn, don't even, listen,  don't even think about shooting your goddamn fireworks off.  We will arrest you.  It is a federal offense.  Don't shoot your goddamn fireworks off down here.  And they must stay on the ground.  No aerials.  Well, of course, now we start, we wait for night, we can't even wait for night. 
[01:36:00]  Now, we figured before, now, we were afraid of getting caught, so we went on the local street.  Now, the local street on the beach is all sand.  So it's impossible, if someone called the cops on you, it's going to take 20 minutes for  them to show up.  Okay.  So we got this plan.  There's no way anyone's going to catch us.  This is going to be phenomenal.  So we go in front of the house, where it's just all sand, there's no real roads, and we're 
[01:36:30]  lighting off the fireworks.  And we're having a fucking hoot.  Of course, you are.  It's great.  Beyond, we're wasted on wine.  We're blasted shots.  We're having a great time.  Bringing back the buzz of 79.  What's the 79?  We're going back to 1979 in Rosedale, behind the bowling alley.  It's the great buzz of 79. 
[01:37:00]  We haven't had this much fun, which we stole wine coolers from the Chinamen.  So we're hooting it up.  We're shooting off fireworks.  We can't believe how great this is now.  It's a great time, yeah.  We're like, let's save some for the, let's save the biggie biggies for the beach.  So we take them all up, and we leave them in, we basically just cover up.  Now that wives come, mostly mine.  And she's like, you can't leave the fireworks out and trash down on the street. 
[01:37:30]  You should put them in the garbage.  We put them in the garbage, but they're hot.  We don't want to put them in, we don't want to put sand in them.  Oh, no.  So we take the firework garbage, we put them in the garbage pails, and we throw some sand on them.  We're buzzed, so it's probably not as much as we should have.  So now we head to the, now we go to the beach side, and we're lighting the big ones off. 
[01:38:00]  The ones where you need the pipes and tubes and shit.  Sure enough.  I love those.  What a great sound that is.  It's great, man.  Holy shit.  Umbrella.  Umbrella.  That one looked like it was going to land on us.  That's like army shit.  That's right.  It echoes down the beach. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  So we see the cops coming.  Oh, shit.  But again, it's like ocean water.  They're so far down the beach.  We're watching them as we're hiding the fireworks.  And we're taking the fireworks, and we're putting them under the stairs.  There's little stairs that lead to your house, so we're putting them under there.  And we're burying some.  We're throwing others in the garbage.  We still see them coming.  Sure enough.  And we figured, eh, we'll pretend we're caught with some fireworks. 
[01:39:00]  You know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he stops, and he goes, all right, I need an ID from all of you.  So, whatever.  We're taking out the ID.  He goes, now, I'll have you know.  So you're going to tell me where the fireworks are, because I clearly saw you lighting them up,  or I'm taking each and every one of you to jail.  I instantly panic. 
[01:39:30]  And I'm like, listen, man.  And before I can even finish my sense, I have to say, my friend Larry, he works at FedEx.  He's blue car.  He's like, listen, bro, I don't know what you're looking for, but we ain't got it.  You know, you're coming up negative here, bro.  You're coming up negative.  You got nothing right here.  You might as well put your pen away, because you ain't writing a report.  I don't know what to tell you.  We all know that guy. 
[01:40:00]  I know that guy.  We all know that guy.  I know that guy.  And he's got his own sayings.  He's telling the guy, he's like, bro, negative.  I don't know what to tell you.  You're coming up negative.  Puts the pen away.  He got no reports to fill in.  I don't know what to tell you, bro.  So he's sitting there.  But he's not buckling under.  The cop goes, if I'm going to start searching right now, he goes, bro, do what you got to do.  Bring the dogs.  You got to do it.  Do what you got to do.  We're right here.  You're a spuzzle.  Right here.  You're a spuzzle, bro.  So the cop starts looking around. 
[01:40:30]  My heart's good.  Now we're all looking in areas.  He's asking us where we stay in.  He's like, bro, I was just visiting about six hours down.  We're not telling him we're staying right here.  All right.  So he starts looking around.  We're all figuring out where we're going to dart.  And if he sees one, there's six of us.  He's fat.  There's no way he's going to outrun us in the sand.  Can I ask you how long ago this was?  I'm going to say five years, tops.  So you're well into adulthood here. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  This is a story you're doing when you're 19, Jim.  I've got three kids sleeping in the house.  I've got my baby sleeping in the house.  Okay.  Just wanted to know.  So with that, he finally drives away.  He's like, I'm telling him if I catch you, I'm going to find out what house you're in.  He's like, bro, I'll clean here.  We're all clean. 
[01:41:30]  We just told you we're all clean.  We're not like that.  So he drives away.  Now we're laughing.  We're enjoying how we just got out of the Southern police.  Now the homes there have three layers.  It's literally like a Tony Montana house.  Just gorgeous.  And we're looking over the beach.  Now my blue-collar friend Larry, his wife was pregnant.  Thank God.  There's a reason why I say she's pregnant. 
[01:42:00]  We're all winding it up, buzzed, joy in life.  She comes out of the house.  She goes, I'm really tired.  My feet are swollen.  I'm getting cramps.  My back hurts.  I'm going to bed.  All right.  Good night.  Good night.  She comes back out about three minutes later.  Very calmly.  Guys, there's a really, really bad fire in the front of the house. 
[01:42:30]  Really, really bad fire.  But that's how she said it.  And of course, we're like, yeah.  One friend's got the, you know, he's got the pipe.  It's great.  The fire helps the earth and the water.  So she goes back in.  And she goes, no, guys, you really have to do something about this fire.  And she's holding her belly while she's saying this.  She goes, it's a bad fire.  I'm not kidding.  So as she says that, I swear to God, in like slow motion, I just kind of look up. 
[01:43:00]  And as I'm getting up, I see a glare coming over the top of the house.  Oh, shit.  And I get up.  Now, this is from the third level of the house.  And I turn and through the living room and through the kitchen window, I could see the top of a flame.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  And I'm looking.  That's 20 feet high.  Easy.  Easy.  And I'm looking.  20 foot flames.  And we all go right in the front.  Yeah.  And you see.  Oh, no. 
[01:43:30]  This fucking thing's about 20 feet high and 8 to 10 feet wide.  And it's in the front of the house.  Like, oh, my God.  Now it's August.  So everything is literally like a matchstick.  Everything can burn.  There's no.  So we go running outside.  Now we go right outside.  We're literally like dogs.  We're trying to throw the sand on the thing.  Like, you got that section.  And we're taking our shoes. 
[01:44:00]  And we're scooping sand up and throwing it all over.  The girls are taking buckets.  And they're running to the pool and coming back with buckets.  Bucket brigade.  Now you've got to remember, too.  All this is in the sand.  So when you run the house, it's a good 100 feet.  Oh, shit.  So by the time they come back, the bucket's half full.  They're out of breath.  They need help to come and get them for the relay race.  Now the locals are out there.  And they're like, you better call the fire department.  It's going to spread to the rest of the island. 
[01:44:30]  And as they're saying that, you literally, I swear to God, you'd see one little spark come floating off the tree.  Oh, man.  And go maybe like eight feet.  And the minute it lands, it will start up.  And this thing's heading for the next house.  And it's heading for our cars.  So I'm going to say we got it about 60% under control. 
[01:45:00]  60% under control.  I'm going to fight about it.  Yeah, we're about 60% under control.  We're hoping by the end of the day we can really get a bite onto this thing.  Oh, man.  So I'm all worried about the cars.  We start getting the cars, and we're moving the cars so the cars don't blow up.  But it's heading for the other house.  That's what I'm starting to freak out about.  Oh, man.  And so now we got a hose.  Another guy comes out with a hose.  We'll hose it down.  65% under control now. 
[01:45:30]  The fire department comes.  They put it out really quick.  We have to fill out a report.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Now that same day, all right, earlier that day, we started cooking.  I forgot about this.  As we were cooking, now their gas stoves are on the top deck.  So, you know, cooking burgers and blah, blah, blah.  And we're in the kitchen.  We turn around.  The deck, the top deck is on fire. 
[01:46:00]  The barbecue had so much grease in it, it went on fire.  It lit part of the deck.  The deck is syringed.  So we have this situation, and we have the whole front.  Now, the next morning, we get up, and they had a row of trees and bushes just all brown  or gone.  I mean, it's black, brown, and gone.  Where we had the garbage pails, they completely disintegrated. 
[01:46:30]  So, three fires, though.  Right.  So they completely disintegrated.  No, well.  Two fires.  Two fires.  That's from the fireworks that they put in the garbage pile.  So now, we're panicking, going, you know, the real estate agent's going to come here.  Fucking.  Well, sure enough, who comes pulling in the driveway?  Oh, my God.  This guy pulls in the driveway, and it says, I don't want to say the driveway agency. 
[01:47:00]  I haven't been back since, anyway.  They pull up.  The guy gets out, and he's, before he gets out, he's in the car.  And I'm going, oh, my God.  He's just looking at all the damage.  We're in a lot of trouble.  This is really bad.  He's been in the car for, like, ten minutes.  He gets out of the car.  He looks at the direction of all the bushes where the garbage pails used to be. 
[01:47:30]  He comes walking up the stairs.  I open the door, and he goes, hello, I'm from the agency.  I'm going, I know, I know, I know.  This is Vegas.  I apologize.  I go, you apologize?  He goes, I would have got here sooner.  Harry, because I'm here about the kitchen drawer.  Your wife called the kitchen drawer's jammed.  So I'm looking at him, like, all awkward. 
[01:48:00]  And I'm not sure if he's toying with me.  Right, right, right.  So I said, yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Yeah, let me show you that.  We're paying good money for this house.  I was saying, really, you know, I've got family here.  I can't cook a meal.  It's stuck.  Can't cook a meal without lighting everything on fire, apparently.  So he fixes the drawer.  And before he leaves, I go, listen, just want to let you know, the barbecue went on fire. 
[01:48:30]  And he looks at you.  Oh, this happens all the time.  It's not your fault.  Yeah, the cleaner should have done something with the grease or something.  It's no problem.  He goes, is there anything else?  I go, no, sir.  He goes back in the car, and he leaves.  So now we know, all right, here's what we've got to do.  We go to town.  We bought all new garbage pails and green spray paint.  And we spray painted all the bushes and the trees. 
[01:49:00]  I swear to God.  Green and brown, everything.  It had no leaves and nothing.  But we painted it all.  And we had brown, and we were spray painting the sand.  So, and we spray painted everything as if it was back to normal.  And we never, but we came that close to burning down all the outer banks, man.  Dude, that's fucking insane.  Three separate fires.  Dude, it was bad news. 
[01:49:30]  That one that was, the one in the front when the firemen came.  What was actually burning in the front?  What happened was, the fireworks in the garbage pail started a fire in the garbage pail.  Oh, shit.  And then that thing completely disintegrated, and they put it on crates, wooden crates.  Oh, so that shit went up.  So then the crate went up, and then that lit up the bushes and the trees and everything else.  Just start going, it's over.  And this had to have been a period of a good two and a half hours.  Wow.  Between putting those fireworks in there, and then going and catching another buzz, and 
[01:50:00]  dealing with the cops, and then sitting and relaxing and enjoying the night.  All that shit and everything just brewing.  Right.  The fire's just fucking percolating.  Yeah, well, you guys go enjoy the front.  Yeah, have fun.  We're going to percolate here, your friend.  Good way for the perfect opportunity to just burst into flames.  Wow, man.  Thank God somebody saw it, because you motherfuckers just partying.  If she wasn't pregnant.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  And she would have been down there.  To go to bed.  To go to bed, right.  That place would have been lit up.  And I would have been in the news for the wrong reasons.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, bro.  Comedian Jim Brewer, currently involved in a huge fire.  Formerly goat mo-  No, here's what I know.  It would have been like, half-baked sets a baking blade.  Yeah, that's it.  Perfect.  A full-baked, fully-baked blaze in North Carolina by the I'm Not High Jim Brewer. 
[01:51:00]  That's good.  Arsonist Jim Brewer.  Ah, shit.  He's got more to bleat about today.  So the sisters were having a party with the locals with the music and all that?  Yeah.  They were getting along with everybody.  Yeah, they partied their asses off.  They smelt like hungover for six straight days.  Goddamn.  Oh, my God.  It's great down there.  It is great.  I haven't been down there since.  I want to do it again, but no one pays. 
[01:51:30]  I'm the only one that pays for everything.  Oh, okay.  So you can't get people to chip in?  If people chip in, it's a joy.  Yeah, yeah.  It is a joy.  You know, I tried to do it two years ago.  Let's all do it.  And when it came down to chip in, and I literally did it to like a welfare system where I was  like, okay, we know you're not in this category.  So you guys just chip in 200 bucks.  It was progressive.  That's a whole family.  You had a progressive plan.  Buy the beer.  Buy the beer.  Yeah.  You guys buy the beer.  You guys, I think we got like six people going, yeah, all right, we'll go to the rest. 
[01:52:00]  We're like, oh, no, no, no.  Dude, I paid for random calls.  You name it.  Wow.  I was like, just let's all be together.  That's cool.  We'll have such a good time.  And it was.  It was a great time.  Two years in a row.  Your Long Island buddies and shit?  Oh, God.  Just guys you grew up with and stuff?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  I think you might have met them at a show or two.  They used to be Jimmy and Larry.  Larry.  God, it was a great time.  But here's what I was going to say.  I'm in freaking Melbourne, Australia, right? 
[01:52:30]  I'm doing shows the last two weeks in Australia.  I'm in Melbourne and I'm finishing the show and I go, you know, I know a lot of you guys  don't know who I am.  Thanks for coming out.  Blah, blah, blah.  Pizza man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and hey.  Holy shit.  That's cool.  It was like this.  Pizza man.  Yeah.  Napsack.  I know.  Hey, yep, sick.  And they, you guys are huge. 
[01:53:00]  Wow.  With the, I mean, they were coming up after the show going, we download you all the time  on Opie and Anthony and we listen to all the great stories.  And this is the, I actually called Opie and left the message on the wrong phone.  But the guy, this is, the guy goes, we were listening today and Opie was talking about  homeschooling his kid and they were busting around you because they know you're homeschool.  You're all the stories.  Man, right.  We just did this.  So that's, I'm saying. 
[01:53:30]  That's new shit.  Yeah.  Well, that was in freaking Melbourne, Australia.  I mean, yeah, I want to ask you a lot of questions about that.  Maybe another day.  It might be boring for the radio.  Internet.  I don't want to throw my fucking kid in public schools, I don't think.  You don't need to.  You don't need to.  You don't need to.  You got the lifestyle.  You don't need to.  You know what public school is?  Google.  That's what we said yesterday.  That's a lot less experience and you can travel and you make your own act.  You don't have to wake up at four in the morning to get your kid to sit on a bus at seven  so he can deal with some kid that's from another county and shouldn't be there and he's got 
[01:54:00]  a knife on him and he starts smoking pot in a second grade and you don't have to worry  about head lice every September.  This all makes more sense to me.  Like I used to listen to Brewer talk about his kids like, yeah, whatever.  Dude, my kids land.  But now that I'm a father, you're speaking my language.  You know that.  Your kid don't.  Nowadays, do yourself a favor. 
[01:54:30]  I'm sure the curriculum was the same way when we were in school.  Look at one curriculum of anyone through the first to eighth grade and you tell me they're  actually trying to learn anything beneficial that creates any kind of thing that will help  you the rest of your life.  And everyone, this is what everyone's arguing about.  About the social life.  I was going to say that.  About the social life.  Dude, what's socialism?  What are you talking about?  Dude, what do you think we'd lock the kid in a closet like, listen, we're going to let 
[01:55:00]  you see the sunlight for two minutes at 8 a.m.  We'll make sure you enjoy it.  You have activities.  You have baseball.  You have whatever sports activities.  I never played high school activities.  They were all town stuff.  Right.  I had to town pool.  I played town baseball.  Town playing hockey.  Who teaches your kids?  You?  Or your wife?  Yeah, we don't, two of us really, it's a curriculum. 
[01:55:30]  It's online.  Yeah.  It's online.  And if they don't, if they can't figure it out, you go to a, you ask a tutor.  Like we have friends that are teachers.  And then you start getting blown away at how many people actually homeschool their kids.  Now some of them are freaky.  You got to weed them out.  Some of them do it for whatever reasons.  You don't want to know.  But for the ones like myself, it's just like, no, school's retarded.  Do they actually have to sit down and do school work for a certain amount of hours a day? 
[01:56:00]  No, no.  Well, you, yes.  What do you mean?  Well, no, no.  Here's the thing.  Each state is different.  All right?  But your house.  My house?  No.  Just like, for instance.  They get up and what happens?  You have, here's what we want you to do today.  We want you to get through chapter 8 and 9 in science.  We want you to get to chapter 15 in math.  If you have problems, go to this site.  The guy's online.  He actually helps.  I mean, it's that easy. 
[01:56:30]  You go, I need help with algebra.  Bing.  What is your problem?  Well, I don't know how to.  Well, X is the division of a numero that tells you everything.  Yeah.  Do you give them pop quizzes?  Oh, yeah.  We give her quizzes all the time.  Now, here's another thing.  God, how great would that be?  Dude, reading.  Why did I have you as a father?  She reads.  What we used to do was, she would read, and the vocabulary was, if you don't understand 
[01:57:00]  a word, highlight it, and then at the end of the chapter, we'll look up and we'll come  up with funny sentences of what that word, and like how I would use it.  Right.  And so, now, on the freaking Kindles and everything else, you just highlight the word, and you  hit define, and it gives you the full-blown definition.  Everything's up there.  Right on your hands.  Yeah.  Right on your hands.  Why not use it?  Why not use it?  Yeah.  It's there.  It's there.  And then you don't have to deal, and then you talk to your kid the way, you know, my, 
[01:57:30]  listen, man, my daughter is 13.  You're so lucky you got a son.  You're so lucky you got a son.  I'm scared about getting a girl, man.  She's got the body of, hands down, 15, 16-year-old kid already.  That's the problem.  And she's 12.  Oh, boy.  Now, a couple of her friends, I shouldn't say couple, but there's a few where you're  like, I know where you've been. 
[01:58:00]  Really?  You know where they've been.  Already?  And you don't want your kid going there at that age.  If it was a, it's so much different as a boy.  Oh, man.  You know, she wants to wear a makeup.  She doesn't have a phone.  I'm like barbaric.  I'm the only dad who, people, your kid don't have a phone?  No, they don't have a phone.  What would I do in the phone?  Well, what if you drop him off at the mall?  I don't drop him off at the mall, jackass.  She's 12. 
[01:58:30]  You're dropping your kid off at 12 at a mall, and then don't get mad when she's, you know.  Yes.  Jim doesn't even want to say it.  Jim can't even bring himself to say it about another daughter.  Don't, then don't fucking, when she.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  You know what the fuck, you know.  The mall.  Fucking mall.  Holy shit.  That's got to be torture for you.  Torture.  It's, it's, it's just weird. 
[01:59:00]  It's, it's a struggle, man.  It's a struggle.  You're going to have to meet guys and stuff.  Oh, man.  Guys, how do you feel with that?  Filthy animals.  And this is what I'm trying to tell her.  Well, we had to talk with her.  And I have to say, it was, it, I wish I filmed it.  I wish I filmed it.  It was the greatest talk in history.  There's another thing, we're homeschool.  You go to school, remember how you learn?  The, the, Dick Cavett was, you know, and the penis would grow, and it was sensitive, uh, 
[01:59:30]  things on the penis, and, and the woman has a vagina, and then the sperm swims, and, you  know, and then you hear from Vinnie Egan, you know, you, you stick your, your mom, your  dad's wiener, goes in your mom's butt, and pees in it.  Why?  Pees in it?  What are you talking about?  Your friends always had it wrong.  Yeah, of course.  You got to pee on their butt, and that's how you have a baby.  We all sort of thought the same thing.  Girls like peeing on their butt.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:00:00]  What?  They do?  That's disturbing.  Yeah, I said it on the, on the show once before, I thought you, uh, you needed a condom  to get a girl pregnant.  I thought there was stuff on the condom.  I thought there was stuff on the condom, and that's how girls got pregnant.  Right.  It was because of the, because I couldn't figure out why you would put something on your dick.  The missing ingredient.  The missing ingredient.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so it's, uh.  I had to talk with your daughter.  I got to hear about this.  It was a great talk, and I, and I, but you wanted to film it.  Why?  Because we laughed so hard, because here's, here's what it was. 
[02:00:30]  Now, my wife goes very.  Serious.  Godly.  Oh, okay.  Clinical.  Moral.  Yeah.  Clinical.  You know, she'd say, you want to dress in an appropriate manner, and because you want  to show respect, and I'm like, listen, listen, words like appropriate and all that.  Let me, let me talk your language.  A boy is obsessed just staring at your ass. 
[02:01:00]  And she's like, Jim.  I'm like, I'm just telling her what she's going to deal with.  This is what she's doing.  Right.  He stares at your ass.  Now, you've got a great rump.  Oh, Jesus.  She's got a great rump.  She took gymnastics.  I'm already, I'm already in trouble.  She swims, takes gymnastics.  Oh, man.  I got to watch the black guys around this kid.  Oh, no.  So, but the point is, so I'm telling him, like, listen, how you sell yourself is who you're  going to get. 
[02:01:30]  But if you, boys have no clue, no clue, until maybe, maybe 15, 16, 17, where they actually  will go, well, she, I may never date anyone ever again.  I may want to marry her.  Maybe 15, 16.  Before that, it's just, well, I'd like to just see what it's like to stick a thing in  the air and see how fast it lasts. 
[02:02:00]  And I'm sure it's going to feel a lot better than a stuffed animal with a hole in it and  my sock and everything else and my catcher's mitt that I put on.  Oh, God damn.  So, it's trying to get that across.  Now, and she's learning the hard way.  You know, one of her friends, she had a crush on a boy.  And I was like, listen, you can have a crush on the boy all you want, but I'm telling you  right now, you're not dating him, and I'm not going to put in a situation where you're  going to be sucking face with him.  So, I don't know what to tell you. 
[02:02:30]  Now, her best friend, her best friend, she would tell, her best friend, I think, knew  she was trapped and went for it and snagged the boy that she had a crush on.  Now, this, now here it is, this is her first emotional, like, my best friend came and just  took that and, and the way that, and she dressed, the kid was 12 and she's, you know, she looks  like she was in a Motley Crue video. 
[02:03:00]  She's working it.  Friday night, and I mean, I've been 11 years old, and I'll tell you tonight.  So, I mean, wait till you, you don't think about those emotions, but that's how kids start  getting anorexia, and they stick fingers down her throat, and they start doing dope, and 
[02:03:30]  they start doing anything to get, uh, acceptance, and fucking, you want something, you want to  get it, you don't want other people to take it.  Right.  So, for two weeks, she was trying to, trying to purposely dress up.  I'm like, listen, listen, just because that's what she got, and, and, and it all turned out  because, whatever, I'm not going to get into details, but, um, it's just, oh, dude, you  have no clue.  Daddy Brewer's hilarious.  It's exhausting. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, it's just, he's like, Jim his whole life, I've, I've, I've been watching Jim and stuff  and then knowing him for years with this show, Jim is just throw shit out there and stuff.  This is the only time I've seen you tentative with things.  You're like, you want to say shit, but it's like, yeah, I'm a dad, but I don't even want  to think about that shit.  Well, you know, it's funny is, and it's got three daughters, because of the internet,  hell, they can, they'll listen to everything that I'll say.  This will be, there's some guy in Melbourne right now going, I know Jim's daughter's Facebook 
[02:04:30]  page and I'm going to send the link.  Send her a little link.  So I literally have to edit whatever I say in life, I have to edit it because knowing  that I'm going to have three little ears and eyes pasted on that, like, what is, what  is dad saying right there?  So, dude, you, oof.  They're trying to figure out your combination.  Oh!  They're trying to figure you out.  Oh, man.  I'm sweating right now.  Through your performance. 
[02:05:00]  I'm sweating.  What about the, what about the drugs at that age?  Are they around yet?  Um, I haven't seen it, but yeah, yeah, it is.  Oh, man.  You know what's big in my area is heroin.  Oh, that's nice.  Heroin?  Yeah, they're snorting heroin now.  At what age?  Probably 12, 13.  Oh, there you go.  Especially the richer kids.  The richer kids, it's funny, I started working with, I started going this drug addiction program  and I'm going to talk to so many kids and all that, all from parents with tons of money. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  The people with money will look down on, on the low level people like, well, that's  because they got eight fathers and they're all crack pipe addicts and they're lazy and  they ain't got no job and they're, they're on the welfare.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, the ones saying that have so much money and are addicted to working.  They're not around.  Wow.  For their kids and they're all snorting heroin.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's fucking amazing. 
[02:06:00]  They all had like billionaire parents and some of the parents would roll up on a, with  a freaking town car and a limo to see how their child's, you know, I'm paying great money  for the rehabilitation for my child.  Like, well, why don't you go say hello?  Yeah.  How about you say hi and look at the facilities?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, the drugs are there, but I think I'm going to have a good grasp on what 
[02:06:30]  they're doing.  Yeah.  I've, I, you're being, you're, you're, well, not only that, I, you're being a father.  Well, yeah.  You're taking it seriously.  You work hard.  You have to take it seriously.  But I know, I know pretty well.  You're taking it.  But I also sacrificed.  You work hard.  So, I can go through those, what is the word I'm looking for?  So, I went through the, uh, um, experimental to see, like a cake, cake testing.  So, I can explain to them what cakes to avoid. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  Do you understand?  Exactly.  Yes.  I've been there.  I, I tasted many elements.  And I can also tell when someone has been eating certain, uh, products and cakes and cookies.  So, I'm going to be well prepared for everything they try.  We, uh, we got Jay Moore on the hotline.  Oh, shit.  Uh, Jay.  Jay Jay.  What's up, Jay Jay?  Jimmy, what are you, little lost?  Why don't you stop now?  Will you stop? 
[02:07:30]  What are you, little lost?  Taking drugs?  What are you, uh, why don't you go back to, you know which way the jungle is.  Hey, uh, we improved mass transit.  We lengthened the vines.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  What are you, little lost, Mookie?  Hey, listen.  There's no fruits in these trees in this direction.  Head the other way.  You're a good climber.  What are you doing in this neighborhood without a minute?  Uh, Jay Stadium is that way. 
[02:08:00]  There's no hoof courts around here.  I was out there.  And just, uh, I almost just said something like that.  That close.  You're up early.  What are you, filming a sitcom?  And he just handed me a dead bird, which is fucking...  Aw, that's cute.  That is cute.  Where'd he get the dead bird from?  In the backyard.  I let the dog out.  All right.  I'm tired of cleaning up shit and piss my entire life.  The whole house just revolves around people's shit.  Oh, man. 
[02:08:30]  And then the baby comes out.  He's in the yard a little bit.  It's like, kind of dark out.  And he's like, I go, oh, what do you got a little ball?  And I go, oh, my God, get it over me.  It's pretty disgusting.  Jimmy's, uh, show on XM, I've told Jim this, is, is so good.  And his, but I will say this real quick.  People always say to me, like, when they want to, like, slam me, they go,  what do you get some new impressions?  It's like, well, I don't make fucking celebrities.  I can't make more people famous than Joe. 
[02:09:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, if Colin would get more famous.  He does a good Colin.  Of course.  Yeah, it's amazing.  All right.  Don't make a big deal out of it, Jim.  Yeah, I did drugs when they tried to teach us Canterbury Tales.  Does that count, Jim?  But then, Jimmy, I was listening to an old one.  I think it was you and Jimmy Fallon.  And I was driving to a gig listening to you.  And I realized, I think Jim Brewer has more impressions than any of us combined.  No. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, no, I'm being completely serious.  Like, Jim just slipped into, like, Lorne.  And then he does, like, fucking Sharon Osbourne and shit.  And I'm like, what fucking riff gun do you have that's different from ours?  You know what?  It's, I'm a parakeet.  I'm a parakeet.  I think in my last life I was a parakeet.  So are you, Jay.  And this is what I was telling, this is what I was telling Jay.  Hold on, real quick.  Isn't the way Jim said parakeet, did you guys all think he said it wrong?  No.  I was thinking parrot. 
[02:10:00]  Parakeet.  I was like, parakeet.  Parakeet.  Are you still doing a racist guy?  Paraquat.  Go watch out.  There's a parakeet, ain't there?  Were you there for the big paraquat scare of 1977?  There's a bunch of paraquats buying into the next neighborhood.  That's weird to me.  I thought we were still doing racist guy.  No, but we'll get into that.  Oh, boy.  A parakeet.  Let's just say there ain't a lot of parakeets where I just came from. 
[02:10:30]  Jim apparently knows some place that he said I would like that very much.  We'll have to get into that.  After the break, because that can take a while.  I want to hear about this place.  Yeah, it's wherever Jim's dad is.  But here's what I said about Jay.  And I should tell his, first of all, years ago, I would tell his marriage, and I'm like,  why don't you, here's Jay, I'm telling you, Jay, and I'm, Jay should play, I've got the 
[02:11:00]  perfect movie for Jay.  He's got to play a movie.  I always had a movie idea where it was the ultimate, biggest, fucking, over-the-top, hilarious  dick, only because, now listen to me, listen to me, let me see, and his journey is he has  to be humbled, but he's so funny, and over-the-top, and he gets away with it because he's either  got a kazillion dollars, or he's a super-duper rock star. 
[02:11:30]  You know, so like, he shows up at a restaurant at like 4 a.m., and I'm like, sir, we're close,  shut up, get the kitchen open, I'm a rock star, and he's got his shirt off, and it's  so, because when Jay locks into a character, I've never laughed so hard in my life.  Who do you see writing this movie, man?  Well, I tell you what, I've got this great new deal, unfortunately, it's with Dane right 
[02:12:00]  now, and his new sitcom, but...  I tell you, Jay did a great job at his Mr. Brooks audition, I'm...  It fucking sounds...  Maybe it's because I lobbied for 4 a.m. to get the part, but good luck, Papa.  It's the perfect fucking impression that no one knows.  No one knows it, and it's perfect.  It's perfect.  Jimmy, we do Lorne explaining things to you.  Explaining things?  When he shows you up, you did Lorne... 
[02:12:30]  Which one?  ...explaining how...  I don't know, it was like you were...  Jim.  When Lorne reassuring...  Hold on real quick, it was Lorne reassuring you, but you don't realize he fucking pushed  you out of the office in the morning.  Wow.  I'm trying to remember which one, but I do remember this, right before...  And, you know, this is something we never...  We never talked about, too, and I feel like...  This is when, like, me and Jay were very close, and then we had a weird stage, and now  we're back and everything.  It's like old brothers. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, that's my motherfucking homeboy right there.  That's my man right there, Jay Moors.  Yeah, we got each other pregnant.  Jay Moors, a brother from another mother.  My sister from another blister.  I don't even know what that means.  A sister from another blister.  Three across the waters of my biological father.  Jay...  What the fuck was I just going to say?  Uh-oh.  Oh, Lorne.  Oh, Lorne.  I mean, that's what he said on that one. 
[02:13:30]  I don't know.  It sounded good, though.  But Lorne goes, um, when I first got...  Right before I got SNL, I'm the last guy to get it, and the people don't realize that  Jay was released when I got it.  So, it was probably...  Did that ever...  Did that ever give you weird feelings?  Never.  Never.  Okay, good.  I never even known him until you said it.  No, he...  Why don't we cut Jay loose?  We found this young boy named Jim. 
[02:14:00]  No, he didn't want me.  He didn't want me.  He didn't?  No, no, no.  That was...  I don't want Jim.  I don't know why Marcy's so high on him.  That's...  That's what I think.  The NBC one of us...  Brian Chiraki says Jim gives him great calf massages.  We might as well keep him around.  I'm the old Jerry Lewis now, so...  I stink, as Jimmy would say.  Right before I got Lorne goes, you know, there's a lot of people here that really want you to 
[02:14:30]  be here.  There's also a lot of people that don't.  I have to go to California and make a decision for the press announcement, and we'll let you  know then.  And that's...  That's an amazing impression.  That's the best...  Every Lorne impression you've ever heard...  That's how it goes down.  That's a tough...  That's a tough spot to get started in.  Oh, dude.  Holy fuck.  It was...  You're nervous as hell.  You're going to be on network TV, and that's the...  Well...  But when I got that, Jay got... 
[02:15:00]  What do you call it?  The Tom Cruise flick.  And I was like a little girl like, you fucking...  You're reading with...  He's like, bro, relax.  I would always...  I'd go to Jay's house, and Jay would drop names like he's talking about ordering food.  And he's like, yeah, me and Emilio Estevez.  Emilio, Emilio, you're hanging out with Emilio Estevez.  And this is when Emilio Estevez was still Emilio Estevez.  Yeah, how about when I take shit for that?  And then, meanwhile, Jimmy goes, you know, me and Lars. 
[02:15:30]  Nobody says anything.  Dude, fucking Lars.  Lars rocks.  I'm going to tell you something.  I'm not really sure, but we're having this fucking festival, and I think that it would  be fantastic.  Maybe Jay would come on and do a set and do that thing that he does so well, and maybe  get all the fucking characters that he does.  It's just really extravagant.  And, you know, Sean Penn often brings up Jay many times.  Just one night, we were having one of those evenings, and me and Sean were like, you know, 
[02:16:00]  why isn't Jay more in some more of, like, maybe Penn films?  And Penn was like, oh, it's a good question.  You don't even know what the fuck he's talking about.  I remember also, I don't think I ever told anybody that.  What's that?  I was laying in L.A. in my bed watching the first SNL after I left.  Because what they do is they say, we don't know if we want you back. 
[02:16:30]  Jimmy knows this.  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back.  So instead of June 5th, why don't you give us until July 1st?  And you go, all right, whatever.  And then July 1st, they go, give us until July 15th.  Right.  Right, right, right.  And then you go, and that's just their way of, like, breaking you down.  So by the time, you know, you can't go, well, I want to raise, and I want to be on more,  and I want my own spot on update.  And then by the time, you know, give us until June 1st, you're like, anything, just let me  come on, please.  And then when they asked me for the third extension, I said no.  And then my agents said, you realize if you say no, that's not a good negotiating tactic. 
[02:17:00]  If they're not sure they want you, don't give them a reason to not want you.  So I said, well, who wants to work with people that can't make up their minds?  If they want to work with you, it was my take on it.  So I said no to, it was like July 20th.  It just kept going.  And then, you know, it was like 24 hours after that, they're like, okay, yeah, then we're  not going to use you.  Wow.  And then I was laying in my bed in LA, and the first sketch of the season without me  was Will Ferrell screaming, get off the shed. 
[02:17:30]  And I laid in bed, and I almost fucking cried.  And I said, I have made an egregious error.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  I am watching something so special.  It's almost like when you hear the Ramones, like, this is so new.  This is so now.  This is like the wave just crested, and its name is Will Ferrell, and I could have been  a part of it.  I could have been a running mate, man.  And you told them, no, you fucking blew it. 
[02:18:00]  You got Tom Cruise, Papa.  Who's on top of the world now?  Holy shit.  Get off the shed.  Wow.  He's looking up at me like, I don't know what a shed is.  I don't know why.  I keep telling him.  Hey, fireplace.  Why would you want to be in there?  It's odd.  Death birds and fire.  What are you, a fucking caveman?  God damn kids. 
[02:18:30]  Kids are adults.  They're crazy.  They really are adults.  They're lunatics.  And they look at you like, nope, just thinking.  Yeah.  Yep.  Holy fuck.  Jimmy, when you get back in.  Oh, by the way, Jimmy, I'll take your thoughts up the air.  Jimmy's take on Metallica ruining Guns N' Roses.  He loves that.  I haven't heard it.  Can you do it after the break?  I don't know if you've ever done it on our show.  It's one of the most salient things.  I was driving, and I used to think about that shit.  I know you are. 
[02:19:00]  And the reason why I know that is because, I don't know if you said it on a podcast or  a radio thing, but some guy came to me.  He's like, Jay Moore just was on some rock station.  He was talking about how he was listening to you and what your take was on how Metallica  ruined Guns N' Roses.  Wow.  I watch your balls all the time when you're not around.  Yeah.  He literally, it was a revelation for Jay.  Well, I got a lot more for you, Jay.  We'll do it on your podcast.  Okay, I thought the whole point of satellite radio was you don't have to hit the post.  We're going to be sweating. 
[02:19:30]  Let's go to Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  My favorite show.  I want to hear this Metallica breakdown.  All right.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you.  Amen.  Thank you, Jay Moore.  I'll be my man.  I'll see you, baby.  More stories.  I'll see you in like two weeks.  About two weeks.  Yeah.  More stories.  I'm a fan of the more stories, I got to say, on iTunes.  Jay's a natural.  Jay's on our channel this weekend because Jay gave us a few hours and we broke it down so 
[02:20:00]  people could hear it on us.  I started my own label.  I left a smodcast.  I got my own label starting tomorrow.  Ah, see?  Look at that shit.  Small man.  You know what?  We might have to talk.  It's the wave of the future.  We're going to have to talk.  Wave of the future, Jay.  Might have to talk.  The future.  The future.  We see the future.  Ah, the podcast will be a thing that will, everyone will have a podcast in the future.  The future.  They already do.  I know.  I know.  It's the futures now.  All right, Jay.  But we're the big guy.  Thanks, man.  We're the big guy in the podcast world.  All right, more. 
[02:20:30]  That's right.  More stories, everyone.  Thanks, Jay.  Later, Jay.  Boy.  Brewer's here fucking killing it as usual.  Saturday night, Starland Ballroom.  Yes.  That's in Sayreville, New Jersey.  Sayreville.  Yes.  And Jim Brewer.com.  Jim Brewer does a very good job with his site.  The tanning lady.  That's weird.  It's disgusting.  It is disgusting.  I thought she was trying to...  I thought, honestly, I didn't see the whole story, and I saw her mother getting arrested.  I thought it was because she colored herself in blackface. 
[02:21:00]  Did blackface thing.  Yeah, that's what we said.  I really thought she was...  She tried to do a joke and colored herself in blackface, and she got in bad trouble.  And I realized it was over tanning.  I still don't know what it is.  She looks like someone dying of, like, ricin poisoning.  Yeah.  Like somebody fucking stabbed her with a piece of ricin, and she's laying in the hospital rotting.  Well, she can't possibly think she looks good.  She probably does think she looks good.  What is that about?  Look at my tan.  Is that hoarding shit?  OCD shit?  What is it?  That's gotta be some kind of OCD.  She looks in the mirror and probably sees, like, a pale person.  Jesus.  I need more tan. 
[02:21:30]  Wow, David Tell, he's terrible.  He grew a beard.  He looks awful.  Oh, we're gonna blow up some buildings.  Growing up buildings.  Lived in a cave many years.  Listen up, people.  Okay.  I understand.  I'm hated.  Okay.  We got a giant purple suit to buy.  That's what he said about Patrice.  When we're all depressed, fucking, pretty much everyone has tears in his eyes. 
[02:22:00]  He broke the ice by saying, what was the exact line?  It was, you know, yeah, yeah.  Come on, people.  We have a giant purple suit and a coffin to buy.  Fucking hilarious.  He got us through it, man, because it was rough.  It was rough until Littell said that.  We all fucking lost our shit when he said that.  Do you got the actual line?  That's funny.  That should be on a hot button, man.  Yeah, that's a great one.  You should find that fucking name.  Fucking Attell is brilliant.  He is so fucking funny. 
[02:22:30]  So funny.  Asshole.  He's like a, you know what he is?  He's a funny sniper.  Yeah, yeah.  A funny sniper.  Like, when you need, you're like, there's no way we're gonna get out of this situation.  Get us, David Attell.  Comes in, this is the guy you bring in here?  We're in the middle of something tragic?  We just lost one of the greatest comics that's ever been here?  This is what you bring?  Okay, people.  He takes a long drag of his cigarette.  Okay, let's get a purple suit and a coffin, people. 
[02:23:00]  People.  We're gonna continue with Brewer.  We got a couple things.  Metallica ruining Guns N' Roses.  The perfect place for Anthony to live.  I didn't forget.  I want to hear that.  You found a place where Anthony should live?  Yes, this is his home.  This is where he's retiring.  I'm looking forward to hearing it.  I'm telling you, you're gonna love this.  And you have a motive to be there.  Oh, good.  Cool.  Can we play Cloud Guy again?  I love it. 
[02:23:30]  I really want to.  That's Cloud Guy.  This guy's fucking...  It's just a guy that thinks he could, like, uh...  Use telekinesis to reshape clouds.  Shape clouds.  But it's how he talks.  I love these guys.  Oh, yeah.  Just a fucking kook.  I love these guys.  Listen to how he says square and cloud.  I love it.  He's getting into it.  It's the only reason we're playing this again.  I can't wait to hear it.  This is a weather control, cloud, psychic cloud control video by T-Chase.  See this cloud?  I make videos where I'm able to control clouds by my psychokinesis, psychic power. 
[02:24:00]  I'm making this in, uh, recording this September 2010.  See this cloud?  I'm going to try to turn this cloud into a square-shaped cloud.  Make this cloud into a square-shaped cloud.  By psychic power, turn it into a square-shaped cloud.  Cloud become a square-shaped cloud.  Turn into a square-shaped cloud. 
[02:24:30]  Cloud become a square-shaped cloud.  Turn into a square-shaped cloud.  Turn into a square-shaped cloud.  Turn into a square-shaped cloud.  Turn into a square-shaped cloud. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, that's good.  Cloud become a square-shaped cloud.  Oh, that's a good plot.  Cloud become a square-shaped cloud.  Turn into a square shape, cloud. 
[02:25:30]  See the clouds becoming more of a square shape, cloud, become a square shape, cloud.  Serious XM, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:26:00]  It's always been that way, but no one told us before now.  New problem.  I don't like that.  No, that's a bad fucking new problem.  I don't like the sound of that.  We need to talk to Blatter immediately.  Not stupid Gary, not stupid Rob, Steve Blatter.  We got Jim Brewer in studio.  Jimmy is going to be at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey this Saturday. 
[02:26:30]  Warming up for the Metallica shows.  What?  It's warming up for the Metallica shows.  Man.  The Orion Festival.  Orion Festival.  You don't know about the Orion Festival?  No.  What's going on?  Metallica's doing a festival in Atlantic City.  You don't know about that?  And that's why you're down there?  Well, I'm playing that festival, and I'm hosting the comedy tent, but I'm also doing... 
[02:27:00]  Next year, I'm going to start touring, doing...  I come out and do stand-up, and then we do the rock comedy freaking thing.  It's going to be big, ridiculous, over-the-top, 80s, metal-looking show.  Holy shit, that's awesome.  I had no idea.  Yes.  That's great.  Yeah, that's what's going to...  I feel like it's almost an inside joke.  You really don't know?  I swear I don't know.  You don't even know that?  Are you not Metallica fans?  Is that what that is?  I am a Metallica fan.  I am a Metallica fan.  You didn't know they were playing a festival here?  My hell's not.  It's their first one.  My... 
[02:27:30]  Here's my problem.  I feel like life is passing me by, because...  Well, you got a kid.  Because of these hours, and I have a kid.  I went to the Bruce Springsteen show last night, and I loved it.  You're going to be hurt for a week and a half.  I didn't realize how many people are just using their phones at concerts and stuff.  That's how long it's been.  Yeah.  Fucking...  That's all they're doing.  All you see is a sea of phones.  Yeah, I'm bad with my phone.  But these people weren't even...  I mean, we were lucky.  We're really close to Bruce, and they spent half their time updating their Facebooks,  looking at other set lists from other fucking shows and other things. 
[02:28:00]  There's articles about Bruce Springsteen.  I said this earlier.  I wanted to tap the lady next to me and go, do you realize he's 20 feet in front of you?  He's right there.  He's right there.  He's right there.  He's right there.  He's right there.  I got my phone.  There was a couple slow songs for me.  I'm like, ah, whatever.  And I did a quick little something, something.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But these people were on the entire fucking time.  I'm telling you, I saw this.  I saw U2, the zoo tour or whatever. 
[02:28:30]  Zoo station.  A lot of people didn't like that, blah, blah, blah.  But it was...  Bono is really deep and insightful.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he comes out at one point and he's just singing.  And they're really just like, yeah, what a great song.  I don't know why it hit me the way it did.  Had nothing to do...  I already stopped pot, so it wasn't pot.  He would take the...  He came out on stage and he had a camera and he's facing it to the audience. 
[02:29:00]  And then he's looking at himself and he's going, this is better than the real thing.  And he just kept saying and singing that, oh, it's better than the real thing.  Is it real?  It was the way he said it really defined what was on our way.  And he was doing that a decade ago.  Right.  And really, that's what it is.  You sit there and you watch...  When I was at the...  Did you go to McCartney?  I saw McCartney at the Apollo.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, we were sitting right next to each other.  We were in the same row. 
[02:29:30]  I was sitting...  No, I was literally sitting right next to him.  Yes, you're right.  Our elbows were touched.  That's right.  Norton was there, yeah.  That was hilarious.  Remember Keith and Ron was?  I just did the same thing.  I'm like, were you there?  I know.  I'm like, wait a minute.  I was too busy being on my phone.  I don't know.  That was hilarious.  I even found myself at times, like watching more of me with the video and then going,  just put it down.  Yeah.  Enjoy this moment.  That's...  You're never even gonna look.  And then you look at the video, like why did I even film this? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, shitty video.  Why are you filming this?  Sounds like this.  That was terrible.  That's the yesterday guy right there.  Yes.  Just watch.  You're not gonna get this chance anytime soon to be this close to the yesterday guy.  Put it in your fucking memory.  Right.  But at the show last night, it was, I was like, I couldn't believe it. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  That's how long it's been since I've been to an actual show.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  Metallica ruining Guns N' Roses, Jim Brewer.  All right.  Jim Moore says this is just amazing.  All right.  I should tell this.  He can't get enough of this.  I'm gonna tell this story.  I should tell this story.  I'll tell it at Starland.  You like the way I snuck that plug in?  Ah, nice.  Saturday night, I'll tell it.  Starland Ballroom.  At the show.  Sayreville, New Jersey, Saturday night.  So, here's, I'm telling you, it's more than, here's when Guns N' Roses went down.  When Metallica and Guns N' Roses toured together. 
[02:31:00]  Do you remember that big tour?  Oh, yeah.  Now, I don't even, I'm gonna-  What year was that, by the way?  I'm sorry.  Just for a reference point.  I'm gonna say it was right, I'm gonna say it was 1980, I'm gonna say it was like 89,  90?  Yeah.  You can probably Google that.  Okay.  Is that when, uh, Hedfield, uh, had the fire incident there on his arm?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  That's 20 years ago already?  More than 20 years?  Get the fuck outta here.  Nah. 
[02:31:30]  I hate hearing that.  Yes, well-  I think you're right though.  No, but here, check this out.  Yeah, it was easy 20 years ago.  Wow.  But here's the thing.  Jesus.  You had clash of the titan egos.  Yes.  Now, Metallica's represents the non-ego, we come from the streets, we bring straight  up metal, we come to kick your ass, smash you in your face.  Um, welcome to the jungle.  What's his name?  Axl Rose. 
[02:32:00]  Axl Rose.  Guns and Roses.  Fatsl Rose.  Fatsl Rose now.  Axl Rose.  Brilliant at what he does.  However, he comes as that, I'm a badass, I start fights, I represent rock, and we own  the hard rock world.  You know, he had Slash with the hat, you know, with his own sound.  Now, the biggest tragedy they could have done was, Metallica, and it was like, this 
[02:32:30]  is the greatest, and it was, the greatest rock duo.  Two huge fucking bands.  Huge at the time.  The biggest bands at the time, right there.  Hands down, you have Metallica and Guns and Roses.  Here's what the problem was, they'd made Metallica go up first. 
[02:33:00]  Metallica goes up for an hour, hour and a half, and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say  this is pre-Black Album.  Wow.  I think you're right.  Black Album was what, 92?  No, no.  91.  91?  90-91.  90-91.  So maybe just before.  Because I just moved to New York, and I must have listened to it five, I breathed it.  I was like...  Sad, but true.  He's lying, lying. 
[02:33:30]  I mean...  Only I'm in the world, you are, you know not.  I live in it.  I don't know me.  I don't know me.  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.  Holy fuck.  Got a lot.  Uh...  So anyway.  Lived and breathed it.  Now comes, now Metallica's up pre-Black Album.  They go out there with their jeans, shirts, for an hour straight. 
[02:34:00]  2018.  And people go, what is this?  and people go what is this even if you didn't know what they were you were going what is this 
[02:34:30]  every chick is going finally something that's not so scary  now people like all pre-black 
[02:35:00]  people leave they're they're exhausted they can't believe now here comes with white leather 
[02:35:30]  a long cigarette holder  i'm not going out there for at least another hour  you tell them they'll have to wait for me i'm at the rose and we shall not go on to 11 o'clock at 
[02:36:00]  night to wait for those metallica people to leave even my own fans are turning against me  his ego was he was played he looked like an idiot he looked like an idiot on his own house in his own  house coming out back then probably more guns and roses fans obviously absolutely and they all went  wow he he just got exposed just got exposed you can't follow that with 
[02:36:30]  how long can we listen to ethel merman before we realize this guy's just wearing nice clothes  he's got bad teeth and that was the beginning of the end and they never ever ever recovered from 
[02:37:00]  that tour ever that was the end of guns and roses as far as a band a tour as him as a star he started  losing his mind he got fat he lost off the felt that was it it was over couldn't get along with the band  anymore it was done done it was over calica just down and dirty working hard they did the clash it's  like me as a met fan every this is what you know some some yankee fans that i have one yankee fan that  tries to you know he he's always he's like no no root for the mets this year root for the mets this 
[02:37:30]  year and you know for up until about a week ago i started getting a little emotionally a little  emotionally involved like oh i love this kid doing house and wow they're four games over but that's  what a met fan it we're four games over four games over this is exciting just hold it on to that  yeah as long as we can but until they're exposed by a real team that comes along and exposes all  their flaws that's when you realize like oh yeah they're really not um gunsters roses was a hot chick 
[02:38:00]  but then it got some metallica exposed him saying no you're surrounded by a bunch of ugly chicks  you're not just a hot chick there's a lot of ugly chicks right we just stripped you down i i truly believe  his ego was squashed and they never recovered from that tour a few people saying it was 92  what was the tour that tour uh 92 what do you got sam which would be the blackout july through october of 
[02:38:30]  92 oh even with the blackout man then then you're out of your mind to tour with them and the blackout  was new they're just promoting it they were just promoting it no one knew it oh my gosh oh boy  and appetite came on 85 86 ish somewhere around there right yikes so what album did guns and roses  have going on use your illusion one and two at that point yeah and the black album well that was an  ego-driven fucking uh project too that double album faith no more opened that's what i'm hearing from  tom the mccain yeah faith no more they wanted nirvana to open but kurt wouldn't do it why because 
[02:39:00]  he's smart he's smart no i'm he's smart i don't want to follow yeah he's a comic i know if there's  a guy that's just he's kicking i'm not gonna say i'm just gonna say nah man do my own thing which  really i know i can't follow this guy this guy's gonna make the snot he's gonna make my life gonna  murder he's gonna murder i can't do this i can't do this wow yeah but guys and roses i was surprised  at the time they went with that double album shit too no they were getting late i mean if you put 
[02:39:30]  a typical story you put the double album together it would have made an amazing album yes it would  have but you know it's that's the trials of life doing double albums back then no well there's six  songs that were decent six on the two of them so what'd you have we don't need your civil war  axel yelling at some producer that nobody knows dude i'll kick your ass i'll put you in the ring 
[02:40:00]  and i'm like who's he yelling at who's he yelling at his neighbor record producer who can't what are  you yelling at uh guccioni's son or something i still don't even know who cares what about november  rain uh november it's a nice this song when you're in the backyard or it's at the end of the night  i loved i loved i i i loved patience uh i mean there were i like guns and roses but i like i do too i like 
[02:40:30]  how you break that down it's pretty funny man they squash the ego there's a great i'm trying to look  at what there's a great documentary if you if you you've ever seen metallica's a year and a half in  the making there's a moment on there that to me i know this sounds ridiculous but to me defines so 
[02:41:00]  much there now as a fan you look and you see guns and roses it's it's like tom cruise freaking  the ultimate mega star of stars slash and axel right they're at a bar and they're with maybe  kirk from metallica and james and slash is is wasted and he's at the table and i and i'm not sure if 
[02:41:30]  axel is and you would think you would never say something like this is slash and slash knocks over  his beer it's a very simple moment but it defines so much because it's something like we would never  do he's and the beer spills over james stands up and he just gives this real disgusted look and  he's watching them and he goes well wipe it up dick 
[02:42:00]  and that that's just great i just watched that moment like it up dick that just shows like we  don't care who you are right just just get your act together  yeah and it was just one of those holy shit i don't care who you are here i don't care you're  on stage you're coming to play you're coming to play and it was uh you know where any one of us 
[02:42:30]  like oh don't worry yeah yeah yeah slash spilt his hair how cool is this guy's a rock star there's a  beer he put beer in me he's going well wipe it up dick yeah i was i gotta fucking see that yeah right  it's hilarious it's in a year and a half of the making it was and there's also a moment on there  where you could james he's he's got a um there's a poster of winger oh shit he's throwing darts at it  but he also gets the rider to to guns and they were like in the wrong tent or whatever oh shit they 
[02:43:00]  had the rider to axel rose rider and all all the shit that that axel demands and he reads it off  on the documentary and you're just like wow and it just it made you realize like they're just they're  never going to recover from this stand them can see after what they realize it's fucking stand yeah  i'm here to play music you're here to drive a limo leather pants and kangaroos what you want 
[02:43:30]  i got my little pants and my kangaroo because i'm so damn successful  hence the end of guns and roses as we knew it that was it so there's my uh jesus i love it take  on the end of guns and roses we got uh we got dana white checking in from the ufc shit on the line uh  dana dana good morning guys how you doing man we were hoping to see you in studio but 
[02:44:00]  uh we're here and you just flew in yeah i got here really late yeah i can imagine ah what's uh  what's uh what's going on what's the big story oh fuck saturday night yeah at the izod center  another ufc event on fox yep it's our fox event yes uh we're over the eyes you guys coming  uh i i absolutely am gonna go i have ridiculous yeah i'm going on at my house i can't really get away  before we talk about saturday i just got to tell you that last pay-per-view was awesome i'm not 
[02:44:30]  gonna lie to you i don't i don't get all of them i get i get one here and there but i i loved it  man i absolutely loved it that rory mcdonald holy fuck i didn't know much about him until uh  until that past pay-per-view he's an animal he's a killer gsp is saying he's going to be the next uh  170 pound world champion to uh he thinks the kid is great too he is unstoppable man that kid looks so  good and and that was me and rogan you know how me and rogan get all pumped up for these fights 
[02:45:00]  yeah we talked about that one for a week because that shane mills kid yeah up is insane yeah we  were expecting that fight to be a war yeah we were wrong about that one oh my god but i agree i thought  the pay-per-view was great all the fights were incredible and uh you know even the main event  people are giving john jones shit because he didn't finish the fight but i i don't think that  rashad evans gets the respect he deserves oh yeah the ufc since 2005 he's only lost to uh uh leon  machida yeah yeah no absolutely i mean john jones uh would have loved to have finished him off but i 
[02:45:30]  mean rashad yeah he's no stranger to the fucking cage how about the second round when when uh jones  is throwing elbows like their hands oh yeah yeah those elbows i've never seen that before you're  absolutely right he throws an elbow like it's like you know a punch across right exactly and  usually no he doesn't throw like that he literally comes across like all the way across we got jim  brewer in the studio like he's swimming yeah he's you got to deal with elbows and knees when you're 
[02:46:00]  fighting john jones yeah it's unbelievable yeah he's unbelievable he is he really is no i liked it i i  you know you always want to you know see a knockout or whatever but i i absolutely like the uh the main  event well that that fight had everything that night you had knockouts there was uh there was a  submission uh there was an absolute war uh you remember the fight between uh who was the fight  that the uh the kids in canada um uh hominic mark hominic oh right right yeah oh yeah that kid from 
[02:46:30]  hawaii yes the short kid and the tall kid that fight was unbelievable yeah do you worry about all the  blood no no because i know you're trying to get sponsorships and and you're on fox now and stuff  that one fight the blood i was like wow yeah yeah that fight was a war man no you know that's that's  part of it you know when guys if you look at the overall sport when you think about it you know do  guys get bloody yes there's that there's so many misconceptions about the ufc there's never been a 
[02:47:00]  death there's never been a serious injury in the almost 20 year history of the ufc so yeah you're  going to have some blood yeah yeah no that's cool i i don't mind it oh yeah it adds to the  whole experience yep so uh with that said saturday it's uh eyes hot center ufc on fox you got nate  diaz and uh jim miller yeah yeah but you're saying that's what you're asking me yeah no yeah we got  it we got a great card actually uh the co-main event hendrix versus koschek is going to be a sick 
[02:47:30]  fight too uh we're starting the show off with uh pat barry and lavar johnson two heavyweights  there's no way in hell that fight's going the the distance oh yeah yeah and uh the the nate diaz  jim miller fight sets uh set somebody up for a title shot you know i don't know uh if that fight goes  one round or five rounds it's going to be a fun fight that fight should be a war oh yeah definitely  yeah people love the diaz brothers man oh absolutely i'm absolutely yes brothers yeah 
[02:48:00]  you watch the ufc jim brewer one average i gotta wait till the kids are in bed  daddy why is he bleeding i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna go to bed  uh yeah we uh we were talking about a ufc fighter taking on a lion uh today earlier on our show i forgot  you were calling in too but it just came up because this is viral video that's out today so we started  thinking about what what you would do if a lion attacked you and then i'm like you know what  that would be a great pay-per-view that i know some of these guys would absolutely go for ufc guy 
[02:48:30]  i know this is a guy would go for it but i know this is a complete fantasy world trust me  dame against a hungry lioness yeah no way what's funny you guys say that fox did a commercial about  that frankie edgar from new jersey uh he's walking with his girl at the zoo and a lion gets loose and  he choked the lion out oh really yeah i haven't seen that one it's really funny we've had frankie  in too yes oh that's that's all right there's the scenario yeah okay 
[02:49:00]  yeah we were uh wondering if you know if uh the lion would lay off if the guy tapped but i don't  think so i think you like you tap the lion on the shoulder and it's like he's still gonna eat your  face off yeah i think he just might do that yeah yeah so what are you doing in new york uh for a  a little recreation time what do you do this guy doesn't relax i got a full day of pr today uh  today and tomorrow uh and tomorrow the weigh-ins and everything but doing a lot of stuff for fox uh  for fuel tv and for for big fox man you are a businessman you are a fucking businessman i love 
[02:49:30]  this guy and it was cool because uh the ufc cameras were in here and we got a little little  taste yeah that worked out very well i like that yes we had rashad evans punch uh jim norton  huh poor jim an episode of prime time yeah we were on it man there was a nice two-minute piece  about rashad evans coming in uh into our show and uh he punched jim norton and they put it together  nice yeah that hurt jim that's a great show man it really is it's a good joke if you're a fan 
[02:50:00]  or i've never seen the ufc before when you watch the prime time it kind of tells the story of the  fight and gets into these guys lives and who they are it's a fun show yeah you think john jones  i heard one of one of my guys who lives in boston was hitting me up and told me one of you guys  are a big blackjack player oh no shit yeah that's yeah that's me i love blackjack blackjack bro i  play four nights a week i'm a complete yeah when it comes blackjack man oh you gotta come out play  with me talk about psycho i'm the guy that sits there going oh really really can't even win with

[02:58:00]  okay you need to move to either australia right or new zealand okay all right did you check out new  zealand was no  but from what i heard yeah it's even um more of your tribal culture right than australia  i've never seen you know i've been to england i've been everywhere germany yeah australia 
[02:58:30]  i was like there's like it's so white here  i mean they are white white yeah and they're very comfortable by that no not at all and and i and i  didn't really it the only thing that i i was blown away how many people they have asians  they're asians and i i think it's chinese  are equivalent to our mexicans and what i mean by that and i don't mean that in a derogatory thing 
[02:59:00]  i'm saying every service place uh-huh here i went to an italian restaurant  chinese waiter chinese cooks wow yeah in like the authentic the the italian guy greets you in the  front and then the asian waiter comes up and then they're you look at my daughter was like dad look  who's cooking your chicken parmesan and they're like there was a lot of asians i was blown away 
[02:59:30]  how many freaking asians but matter of fact there was one night where um and they're like kind of  openly racist there oh that's what i heard too yeah yeah jim jeffrey said that yeah i literally it was  i was in sydney australia and i'm doing the show and i as a joke i say wow the one thing i've noticed  about australia is there's no mexicans here and there's not a lot of like black people and they go 
[03:00:00]  like that's because i can't afford it it's too far from still can't afford it and the guy yells  out and i said wow that was openly racist and he goes you got it  and like i wasn't you got it and you're not on your turf so you can play that politically correct  hey man you shouldn't say but they were just like hey yeah i'll get there was a big thing going 
[03:00:30]  on down there where these i i want to say they were alborigine kids oh yeah aborigines yes albert  hey it's al alborigines my fucking buddy alborigines  and they they were in a car chase but they stole some car they stole a car of course they did they  they they stole a car they went on a high chase high speed chase the kids then led them to an uh a 
[03:01:00]  very populated area drove down the street hit not one but two women oh shit dragged one woman wow under  the car the cops you know shooting at the car they shot the one kid through the neck and they shut  the other it just kept shooting they dragged the kid out and as they're dragging them out you know  they're taking swipes at them and sure everyone's videotaping uh-huh um they dragged every single one 
[03:01:30]  of them out um the one cop is trying to to bring the one kid back to life that's on video you probably  look it up just say wow and people started in the community where they lived protesting  about what a bunch of monsters the cops were for the way they reacted and and it was such a play of  politics and and the way the media spins it and the way people videotaped it right where i give the 
[03:02:00]  police guy a lot of credit because he came on and they go why didn't you shoot at the tires  and he goes first of all uh when we draw our guns we're not um drawing to stop someone we're drawing  our guns to kill them um we uh what you're not even mentioning in every protest we're like what are you  you know innocent kids they're 14 to 16 like what people aren't saying is that um when you're in a 
[03:02:30]  high tail chase to me i consider that attempted murder because you're putting innocent lives in danger  and um and basically he ran over no one's talking about the woman stuck under the car how would you  like to be the lady coming out of the grocery store and she's run over by some thugs that stole a car  that don't belong to them how about we prosecute the parents that weren't there when the kids took  the car at 1am why are children out stealing cars at 1am so as far as um uh shooting at them no i don't 
[03:03:00]  have a problem for anything that's been done and people like we should hang him they should be  prosecuted but at the end of the day i was like yeah that makes all the sense in the world  and to rip the whole thing up they're black and the community was more like you know we almost  wish they weren't black right right because if it was the way no one would have batted an eyelash yeah 
[03:03:30]  no one would have batted an eyelash if there were these young white kids shoot at the tires i thought  what i was shooting at the fucking tires get it get it they're black get it oh my  but i didn't know this about australia they were pretty much all white to the late 70s they weren't  they didn't let anyone in anyone nobody was allowed in and then they open up their borders  this is what i'm gathering from the streets of australian culture yeah after one week there 
[03:04:00]  after one week four billion chinese invaded the place uh about two billion indians yeah and now  the sudans are trying to get in oh man and they have their own aborigines yeah they have that  they do indigenous aborigine right but they shoved them way in the north yeah yeah they turn out to be  like uh the american indian yeah you guys live in the woods there eat your bugs have a good time  to your lifestyle i believe like eating bugs and sticks and whatnot we like buildings and flying 
[03:04:30]  this guy's like sitting down like gentlemen having a nice plate and a fork you like shitting in your  hand we like toilet paper things like that and such we like  yeah they just throw these little big words and such you know you like maybe  hey mate sheep i'm not one to debate what you do there mate yeah yeah enjoy your livelihood  we eat with utensils you apparently they eat with your shithead
