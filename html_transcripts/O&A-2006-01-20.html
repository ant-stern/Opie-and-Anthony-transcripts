<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show, featuring Patrice O'Neal as a main guest and appearances from Twizzles (Twitchels), Treece O'Neill, and Ted Alexandro, covered a wide range of topics throughout its four-hour broadcast.  The show began with a discussion of their past firing from a Boston radio job after a prank announcing the mayor's death, their subsequent success on XM, and the challenges of consistent comedic delivery in a live format. They reminisced about a particularly successful show from the previous day and contrasted it with less successful ones.  A significant portion focused on listener calls describing public confrontations, often involving the hosts' girlfriends,  frequently employing offensive language and exploring race and gender dynamics within these scenarios.

Patrice Oâ€™Neal contributed a comedic song, "It's Raining Stuff," a parody of "It's Raining Men." Listener-submitted country songs, inspired by a previous show segment, were also played.  The hosts offered often offensive commentary on various TV personalities and shows, including Stephen Colbert, The Daily Show, American Idol, and Star Jones. They also discussed their growing popularity and compared their situation to other radio personalities who had experienced a decline after reaching the peak of their careers.

A major segment focused on the recently released Osama Bin Laden tapes, filled with speculation about Bin Laden's motivations (including humorous theories involving cave dwelling and spider bites), comparisons to Hitler and Mussolini, and critiques of Star Jones's commentary.  The hosts also played a game inspired by the complex courier network used to distribute the tapes. This segment featured Twizzles (referred to interchangeably as Twizzles and Twitchels throughout the broadcast), a comedian with Tourette's Syndrome, as a guest.  The hosts engaged in several bits with Twizzles, exploiting his Tourette's for comedic effect, including the "Osama Tape Blinko" game, while also discussing a recent HBO documentary on the condition. Treece O'Neill was also briefly present in the studio.  The production of their promotional ads and the hosts' complaints about their producers were also touched upon.

Another segment focused on Twitchels' significant weight loss and resulting excess skin, described graphically.  The hosts announced "American Mess," a new segment seeking individuals with unusual physical characteristics or behavioral quirks, with the top two "messes" winning a trip to the Lingerie Bowl.  A caller recounted a story about a midget encountered at a truck stop.  Audio of a friend of studio guest Gavin receiving anal sex with a strap-on dildo was played, accompanied by Gavin's laughter.  The show further analyzed the reality show *Beauty and the Geeks*, highlighting the intellectual shortcomings of the contestants, showing clips of them struggling to answer simple questions about the ozone layer, taxes, and pollution.  The "American Mess" open call details were reiterated at the segment's conclusion.


Further *Beauty and the Geeks* discussion dominated another segment, analyzing the women's challenge (answering political questions incorrectly, such as proposing "1 White House Road" as the White House address and "36 Blow Your Ass Up Boulevard" as Osama bin Laden's residence), the men's karaoke challenge, and the elimination process.  The hosts recounted their experiences watching the show with their significant others, leading to arguments about attractiveness and relationship dynamics. Patrice O'Neal's unique perspective on relationships, prioritizing his own happiness, fueled further debate.  Ted Alexandro joined the show as a guest.  The broadcast ended with a game of Operation played by Twitchels, with bets placed by the hosts and guests, further relationship discussions, and promotion of Ted Alexandro's upcoming comedy shows and Woody McHale's restaurant.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We did get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it's just worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Can I just say fuck?  Yeah.  The duo signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new cloud of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Your mom's box.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table.  It's Friday.  Friday. 
[00:05:30]  It's Friday.  Let's try now.  Let's try now.  Let's try now.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Go, Craig.  Twitchels is coming in today, by the way. 
[00:06:00]  So I hear, good morning, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  Hello.  Radio.  Radio.  Patrice O'Neill in studio once again. 
[00:06:30]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Gentlemen.  He's killing this week on this fine radio program.  Please.  I listen to the replays after I get home.  And, God damn, I find myself laughing.  I'm like, I was just there laughing at this shit.  Yeah.  And then I listen, and I'm laughing again, O.P.  I got to tell you, yesterday's show was one of the better ones.  It was just one of the better ones.  Just a lot of fun.  That's what we do.  Some days we fall flat on our faces, and other days... 
[00:07:00]  You wish you could just sit on your laurels and just...  Ah, yeah.  No, because now...  And retire.  Retire after something funny, and you just go, hi, it's well...  You know what sucks about this job?  We know we had a great show yesterday.  We were walking around yesterday at the show like...  We are the greatest broadcasters in radio.  Doesn't mean shit today.  Now, gone, goodbye.  It's disgusting.  There's people out there going, yeah, well, I couldn't listen yesterday. 
[00:07:30]  I had to take a sick day.  I had to take the kid here.  I had to do this.  They didn't hear yesterday's show.  I put that pressure on one of my favorite shows, PTI.  Like, you know, every day I watch it for a half hour, and I demand that they be good every day.  They must be good.  But it's only a half hour of being good.  Like, just...  Yeah.  And they already have all the set material that day, which is just sports.  Just this comment on sports.  That's it.  Not belittling what they do, because I love those guys, but it's like... 
[00:08:00]  I demand that they be funny, but the people listening to this every morning, they're like,  all right, go blow yourself, all right?  It's raining shit, and this and that.  Be funny.  Be funny again differently from yesterday.  Well, all right.  For four hours live.  Fucking guys.  There's no fucking half hour we taped this at friggin' yesterday, or...  And that's what blows about our world, too, by the way.  We could have three and a half hours of unbelievable material, right?  But that motherfucker heard the one half hour where we blew yesterday. 
[00:08:30]  They suck.  Right.  Do type in guy.  I don't feel like it yet.  I'll do it.  You guys sucked yesterday.  Right.  Well, when were you listening?  I listened from 8 to 8.30.  It was the most boring shit I ever heard.  You know that one of the best bits we've done since coming to Satellite Radio was the Fitzgerald  thing.  Edmund Fitzgerald.  The Edmund Fitzgerald bit, okay? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  I remember that day.  That was the only thing that was good on that show.  Right.  And now that's one of those standout bits that people request all the time when we're on  vacation.  But the show on the whole...  I remember that day going, holy crap, we are the worst broadcasters.  That was one of those days we won a battle but lost to the war.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That's how this biz is, you know?  So that day it was three and a half hours of just shitty material and a half hour of just 
[00:09:30]  brilliant, a brilliant bit.  I like watching The Daily Show at night which really blows because it keeps me up and now  it used to just be until 11.30 but now Stephen Colbert's got that show.  And that's a great show.  It is such a great goof on the Fox News specialty show.  Yeah.  Like Daily Show is a good goof on news overall but his is a goof on like Hannity or O'Reilly. 
[00:10:00]  Things like that.  He's got like the talking point segment and stuff and he is one of the funniest sons of  bitches ever.  I know.  Stephen Colbert.  I know Washington, man.  It really is hilarious.  They hit it.  The writers, him, his staff, everybody hit it right on the head from the opening, the  big patriotic opening he's got with American flags and that smarmy look and the eagle flying  through.  And his commentary is so dead on like these right wing conservative broadcasters but it's 
[00:10:30]  so sarcastic that that's where the humor is and just funny as all hell.  So now I'm up until, you know, midnight watching this fucking show.  You got DVR'd, man.  Yeah, but I got to see as it's happening.  It's all about the DVR.  I'm one of those guys because I'm laying there in bed.  So you get four hours of sleep.  Yeah, I get about 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, about five hours of sleep a night. 
[00:11:00]  What time do you get up?  About five hours.  I get up at five-ish, quarter after.  Oh, well I'm just guessing.  That was the night before.  Right after the cold break, you just go to sleep like a robot.  I pretty much do.  I do.  I like, I'm done.  I got the DVR figured out to the point I can watch two shows now because there's so many  commercials.  I tape one and then I watch one live and when that goes to commercial, then I go to DVR  and start the other program that's on the same exact fucking time.  Yeah, we do that. 
[00:11:30]  And I'm amazed that I can pretty much watch two complete shows in the same hour.  Just about.  Just about.  Isn't that amazing?  I'm like, commercials?  What the hell is that about?  It beats the shit out of, you know, picture in picture used to be the way to do that,  but you couldn't, you know, swing it.  I don't even watch shows no more.  No.  All I'd watch now, I'd wait for Saturday night late to watch any MSNBC special, you know,  their prison stuff.  Oh, right.  That's good stuff.  And from time to time, there'll be plenty of tsunami and the end of the world shit on 
[00:12:00]  Discovery.  Yeah.  Gotta watch that.  And then all the sports shit.  Like, you know, first and ten.  Yeah.  PTI and around the horn.  And the rest is like, I'm just trying to figure it out after that, man.  That's something where I'm just homo.  I don't watch any sports shows.  Why?  I just don't.  You're not a sports fan?  No, I'm not really a big...  They've really upped their game, these sports shows.  I know.  I hear they're entertaining.  They're a lot of fun, though.  I turn them on and just the jocks just babbling. 
[00:12:30]  I can't do it.  Ex-fucking air conditioning repair, man.  I know.  Not like sports.  It's not that I don't like sports.  It's the sports shows that I can't...  I cannot get into.  You gotta like those if you like sports.  You gotta like those if you like sports, really.  You don't like sports.  He likes the Yankees.  That's about it.  I like the Yankees when, you know...  Right.  When it's baseball season, I'll keep tabs on the Yankees.  I'm not one of those, you know, stats freaks or anything like that, either. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  But I've enjoyed some ESPN commercials.  They're funny.  That's about as close as I get.  Speaking of sports, they gave what's-his-name five days for going into the stands to protect  his wife.  Yeah, I know about things that happened.  No, I know.  You know the big stories.  I guess they had to do that, though.  You can't start a precedent.  You can't have your...  It's a no-tolerance policy, which I can't stand the no-tolerance.  It's like a kid brings a pretzel to school, bites it to look like a gun, points it at  somebody, and they suspend him for a week. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that's silly.  Yeah, but that's...  You know, I mean, it might be bordering on that Nazi discipline, but you know what?  He did go in the stands.  It's clear.  You can't make decisions.  Case-by-case basis.  What happened to the case-by-case basis?  When you run into the stands because you were laying down and some bonehead throws a fucking  soda at you, and you start pummeling a guy that you think was him, then there's a problem.  So you're saying extenuating circumstances.  This is very...  Why can't we...  We can't...  These days, we're full of zero tolerance. 
[00:14:00]  What happened to case-by-case?  It doesn't happen anymore in court.  It doesn't happen anywhere.  We talked about it with divorce.  This is an unprecedented opinion by a white guy, by the way.  I enjoy the case-by-case...  I've never heard of a white guy say case-by-case.  I'm a case-by-case guy, too.  I've never heard of it from white people before.  I don't like that.  Lock him up and lock him up and...  He did A, so let's look at what A gets down the little flowchart, and he's got to go here, 
[00:14:30]  here, here.  You know, it's bullshit.  But his wife, and I said this before even reading the fucking thing, I know his wife  started the fucking thing.  All right.  I can't imagine, first of all, okay, he's in Chicago, an obscure, let's face it, obscure-ass  Antonio 47-year-old Davis, right?  So there's a role play on the Knicks.  Now, he's in Chicago.  What?  Fucking guy go, oh, shit, I see a black woman and some kids. 
[00:15:00]  You know what?  That's probably Antonio Davis' wife.  I'm going to fuck with her.  No.  He was booing.  He was going, Antonio Davis sucks.  You suck when you was here, you're a big brother.  I fooled her, Buddha.  And she goes, that's my motherfucking husband.  Suck my dick, and that's his children.  And up in his fucking faith, this is why, like, again, you think I don't like women,  I love them, and this is why I'm hard.  My girl asked me the same goofy shit last night.  Would you come into the stands and this, this, this? 
[00:15:30]  No.  Fucking no.  Because I know you got a big mouth, and what guy just says, you're Patrice's fucking girl,  you fucking...  She's going to be protective of people saying her husband stinks, and that's what happened.  He should have stayed and stopped being in love so much, motherfuckers.  This is, this is, we've touched on this subject in a different area.  We absolutely have.  The movies, the movie theater, or any time you're out, if your chick starts shit with 
[00:16:00]  someone, and you're looking like, oh boy, here it goes.  You know whose fault that is?  You gotta, you gotta step in.  You know whose fault that is?  Who?  Yours.  Why?  Can, you gotta learn how to raise your girlfriends better.  You're just gonna let your chick get maybe slapped?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  My girl closes her fucking mouth, because every time I see somebody behave in a certain  way, like, I, like, point at a girl, I go, sweetie, this is what the fuck I'm talking  about. 
[00:16:30]  You, if I step back, this particular man that you think you're entitled to talk to in  a certain way, will punch you through a fucking wall.  You can't beat him up.  Yeah.  So if you can't beat him up, shut your mouth.  Shut up.  Don't ever come out of pocket with some fucking guy.  But, but just being a human being, you've never had that happen.  I, I talked about this a while ago, I was in a Brooklyn movie theater, line, a whole  row of, uh, Puerto Ricans were in there, whole family, I mean, from grandpa down to 
[00:17:00]  the whining little fucking, just out of the womb, already pierced ears, fucking little  Puerto Rican kid.  Who's already talking at the movies?  Oh, already yapping at the movies.  And a woman who just wouldn't shut the fuck up about, it was Mission Impossible 2, Tom  Cruz is on the screen.  Okay.  And she's like, oh, Tom Cruz, mm, oh, that, oh, what I would, oh, what I would do.  Oh, let me tell, and we're like right there, right next to, you reach a point as a human 
[00:17:30]  where, where your sense goes out of your head.  Now, I hadn't reached that point yet because I know I'm, I'm scoping the scene out.  I'm scoping it.  So I'm beyond just the woman yelling.  I'm looking at the whole row going, they are all together.  There are men in there, probably with knives.  Uh, I, I'm not fucking with this.  My girlfriend turns around and, and she had reached the point beyond, excuse me, could  you be quiet?  Um, hey, we're watching a movie.  Now, she went right up to, hey, could you shut the fuck up? 
[00:18:00]  And the girl, the girl goes, oh no, you didn't.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Anthony, Anthony, see, this is, just keep your story, just keep it in your head.  Yeah, it's been in my head.  Immediately, that's your girl's fucking fault.  No way she should open her fucking mouth.  But I'm like.  A family of Puerto Ricans.  I'm like Bush with Iraq.  I can't just leave.  No, you can't leave now.  I can't just pull out my forces. 
[00:18:30]  She put you in a bad spot.  I don't deny that.  I don't deny.  Her, the, the Puerto Ricans' boyfriend turned around to me and then went, oh, you put her  in battle mode.  I'm like, oh shit, she's in battle mode.  My chick, you know, she, she's not gonna fight this, this Puerto Rican, uh, woman.  And, and the family now is turning around.  And she, I'll smack that smile off your fucking face, motherfucker.  That's what it turned into. 
[00:19:00]  So, and, uh, brave me, had to get up, uh, find the usher and find another theater the  movie was playing in.  Yes, you did.  I had to flee the situation.  You did the intelligent thing.  Thank you, Patrice.  You wasn't a pussy.  And as you walked out.  No, I was the biggest pussy ever.  You wasn't a pussy.  That was the smartest thing you could have ever did.  First of all, you should have just sat down and deconstructed your girl's mentality for  saying that.  Now you go, okay, you say shut the fuck up, sweetie.  What was the next thing you was thinking? 
[00:19:30]  All right, let's take this step by step.  What was the next thing that was going through your mind when you told a volatile Puerto Rican  girl who's speaking at a static, at an inanimate object to shut the fuck up?  Okay.  Now, what, what was you thinking after that?  What was the, what was the next step?  Next step is?  Exactly.  Um, I, I, well, I was thinking that she was going to shut the fuck up.  Is that what you was fucking thinking?  That's entitlement.  And it's white girl entitlement. 
[00:20:00]  That shit, it's just like you walk, it's just like when you walk down the street and  a white woman will not move to the left or the right.  She stays straight a fucking head because this is her streets.  You see that?  She feels protected all the time.  Yeah.  I got to do this while she just walks straight ahead.  Now, it's not confrontation.  There's a sense of protection that white women have and women in general have this protection  feel.  I don't think that's a white thing.  Cause I, I, that happens to me all the time. 
[00:20:30]  Cause in my neighborhood that happens all the time too.  It's more of a money thing.  A black woman is not going to say shut the fuck up.  She thought of the second thing before shut the fuck up came out cause she was ready to  deal with the fuck up.  Your girl goes, will you shut the fuck up, please?  Thank you.  What?  Bitch, do you realize your fists or your nails gotta be out when you say shut the fuck  up to a Puerto Rican girl?  She should have been standing like, you know, fucking with the nail, with the Nostradamus  shit to scratch her face when she says shut the fuck up. 
[00:21:00]  That, that is your fault.  And if you have to, you got to condition her to never do that.  I, after that situation, rules were instilled that that shan't happen again.  Well, that's happened to most of us, man.  Most guys.  And let me tell you something quickly before I hope he gets started.  That is a situation that everybody gets into and it is.  And I, I wish there was something that can be done, but everyone in the theater was intimidated 
[00:21:30]  by that row.  Everyone, white, black, other Puerto Ricans.  It was such a loud family that you knew if you said boo to them, you were done.  You were done.  They were turning around and, you know, fuck you and everything like that.  So why should an entire theater be intimidated by one row when everyone should rally around  and go, shut the fuck up and get the fuck out because I'm trying to watch this.  But when she said that, where was everybody else to back you up? 
[00:22:00]  Nowhere.  Nowhere.  They were cowards.  I watched heads, I watched heads disappear in their seats.  I never saw people slumped down so low.  When they sit in front of me, they're up.  They're fucking on, on phone books.  Yeah.  When there, there's a head in front of me blocking my view.  This time, everyone slumped down so low.  So when you, when you please shut the fuck up is never, ever going to shut somebody the  fuck up.  That is, that is, that is intimidation.  That's like your girl should have been ready to be calling someone out for a fight. 
[00:22:30]  It's calling somebody out.  I mean, and, and it's almost like she put your girl, this is your girl's fucking fault.  She put everybody in, in a bad position.  I'm going to tell you what she did.  She put you in a bad spot.  Then she put, um, the girl's boyfriend in a bad spot because he knows, hey, you know  what?  I like stabbing motherfuckers to death, but I don't dislike you, dude, but you know, I'm  going to have to fuck you up.  Right.  And then it puts the girl who's talking in a bad spot because she cannot let a white 
[00:23:00]  woman say, shut the fuck up and not go, oh, I know you didn't.  And she, if she had just did what her job is, is to be a demure white girl, which is  to go, excuse me, I can't infer this movie.  Pardon.  You know who's, you know who's ultimate fault it is?  I understand the repercussions after.  Tyler Cruz.  Yeah.  For being so delicious.  You know who's fault it is though?  That fucking bitch. 
[00:23:30]  She should have shut the fuck up.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  But that's not your training.  Right.  Hold on.  I got to go to the pones.  Someone's calling Anthony out on this.  Dave on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  I'm on a payphone, so it's a little noisy.  All right.  But last time I remember you telling the story, they were black and a Puerto Rican.  Were you afraid of that?  No, no, no.  Dude, I never said they were black.  It was a family of Puerto Rican.  I don't know.  You're using the same, oh, she's in battle mode.  I don't remember any Puerto Rican.  No, it was absolutely Puerto Rican. 
[00:24:00]  It was a huge family.  I described it as a huge family.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anthony, it's like Chinese, Japanese.  Ah, whatever.  No, I will absolutely deny that, sir.  It was a Puerto Rican family.  It definitely was a Puerto Rican story because Puerto Rican will give you that.  Puerto Ricans will give you out.  That's the good thing about Puerto Ricans.  Yeah.  They will give you an out if you piss them off.  They'll go, you know, son, you know what? 
[00:24:30]  Well, you know, they'll talk to you.  Puerto Ricans will talk to you because they know how serious they are about the violence  and shit.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  So they will let you get a reprieve.  Yeah.  But it's not a black girl because a black girl would have went, what the fuck did that bitch  say?  And her man would have tried to stop her because she would have immediately started lunging  at your woman.  Yeah.  Slapping nails.  Those big ass nails.  Now, I thought, like you said, the second it happened, I'm thinking five steps ahead. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Like, where is this going?  I went into, like, defensive mode.  You should have.  I'm trying to figure out what's happening.  And all I could figure is, if she lunges at my girl, I'm going to have to get in between  because now that's my job.  And if I even look, if I even look like I'm injuring this guy's girl trying to keep her  off of my girl, he then is going to stick a knife in my side.  But that's where you plead to him.  See, this is, this is. 
[00:25:30]  But you can't do it during a physical dispute.  There's no pleading.  It happens like that.  This is where pimping is dying.  You go and plead, plead in pimp style to this guy while his girl is talking.  I always disregard a woman in these situations.  It's your own shit.  I look, this one girl, I was at a show, and she was like, you suck.  You ain't funny.  Why?  And I'm looking at her man like, I'm like, sweetie, hold on a second.  Dude, now, I explained to the crowd, this is the type of shit.  You're appealing to the gentleman? 
[00:26:00]  I said, this is the type of shit that get good motherfuckers in fights.  Now, if I tell, I cannot tell his girl, shut the fuck up.  Now, I'm about six, four, three hundred something pounds.  She can't beat me.  The thing that she's doing is because I'm letting her do it.  You understand what I'm saying?  Girls do what you let them do.  When they're, la, la, la, la, la, la.  So I go, dude, here's what's going to happen.  I'm going to tell you to shut your fucking mouth, right?  And then your man's going to have to protect your honor by fucking with me. 
[00:26:30]  Now, we two good motherfuckers sitting here getting ready to fight because you are an out-of-control bitch.  And I had to tell this guy, listen, you have to raise your bitch correctly.  You put it on the guy.  Always.  All of a sudden, now that guy's thinking, he was thinking, this motherfucker fucks with my bitch.  I'm going to fuck him up.  You turned it around to where if he fucks with you, it's now his fault for not keeping his bitch in line. 
[00:27:00]  For not keeping his bitch in control.  Wow.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  John in Connecticut.  John.  Chris O'Neal.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, John.  I got to tell you this.  Once you hear that, oh, no, you didn't, you got to just run because it's all bad news for  man.  Look at this guy.  He's just recovered from something.  You do.  I fled.  Yeah.  Because I'm in college.  I'm coming out of the cafeteria.  It's late at night.  I got a hot chocolate in my hand.  Some guy bumps into me coming out of the door and about two or three drops of this hot  chocolate hits his black chick's sweatpants. 
[00:27:30]  She goes into the, oh, no, you didn't.  Like, huge scene.  Now, the whole campus center is watching us.  She grabs the full cup out of my hand, throws it in my eyes, piping hot, straight out of  the cafeteria, hot chocolate.  But that's still not enough.  Now, her man has her in one of these arm locks.  She's still, oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Like, arms flailing, legs flailing.  Like, he had to protect her from me. 
[00:28:00]  Meanwhile, I'm standing there, like, blind.  She's from hot chocolate.  She's from hot chocolate.  That's extreme.  Yeah.  Well, once you know they don't know you didn't, you got to just get out of there.  Yeah, that's code for run.  Man, yeah.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Let's go to Jim in Brooklyn.  What's up, Jim?  Yo, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  A similar situation happened to me about eight years ago.  My wife was pregnant with our first kid.  We walk into a small movie theater in the Heights here in Brooklyn. 
[00:28:30]  And you know how women get it.  She was irritable.  So we're sitting down listening to the movie.  And all of a sudden, two young African-American girls are sitting in the theater.  They start talking and yapping away, right?  All right.  So my wife is getting a little restless.  And I felt the same way.  But what am I going to do with two girls?  So all of a sudden, like halfway during the movie theater, these girls were talking the whole time. 
[00:29:00]  My wife just turns around and like a spit coming out of her mouth.  Shut the fuck up.  And then the two girls like, no, she didn't.  And then I'm saying to myself, oh, shit, here we go.  I mean, what am I going to do?  We'll fight two girls?  So when we leave the theater after the movie, the two girls are standing outside waiting to beat up my wife.  She's eight months pregnant.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you don't want the after the theater fight.  No, no, no.  But in terms of the situation being the way it was, what was I going to do? 
[00:29:30]  I had to jump in between if these two girls were going to grapple with my wife.  There's no way I was going to let them grab her and try to knock her on the floor.  But it was one of the funniest situations.  But like Anthony was saying before, you just slump down in your seat,  and I turn around to my wife and I say, please, it's just two girls.  I've seen brawls going on in movie theaters where a guy is sitting there  and the girl says something or he says something,  and it's a group of Puerto Rican or black kids or something like that. 
[00:30:00]  You can usually shut white kids up.  You really can.  In certain theaters, in most cases, in certain ages, in most cases.  Yeah, I agree.  But the only reason I know that is because I've seen people try.  You rarely see.  You see a group of black kids walk in or Puerto Rican kids walk in,  and they are being loud, and they sit down.  You don't say shit.  You sit there and have your movie ruined.  That's it.  Because if you say something, no one's coming to your aid.  I've seen it happen.  There's a way to do it. 
[00:30:30]  Could you be quiet?  You shut up, motherfucker.  You hear it from the back, and you're like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now there's a problem.  Oh, boy.  Now there's a problem.  First of all, there's one thing that I do have to say.  I guess I'm being from Boston.  There's certain major cities where you do get white training.  If you live in Manhattan, you get white training.  Boston, Philadelphia.  There's some white training going on where you deal with white people.  There's some places, if you're black, you don't understand passive aggression.  Passive aggression is one of those weird things that I'm sure before your girl, and I'm sure 
[00:31:00]  before this guy's pregnant wife went to go shut the fuck up, it was turning around, looking  passive aggression, kind of, you control yourself now, kind of, and that also makes fucking  like black girls very angry is that, and so they get louder.  I bet you if you think about what happened, they got louder and louder as your girl's 
[00:31:30]  frustration.  Because they knew that what the fuck, you know, she's doing.  Well, there was other passive aggressiveness going on.  A lot of passive, and they get a lot like, fuck, what you think, your white huffing?  Other people.  Stop me?  Motherfucker, my house ain't fell down yet.  You can huff and puff all you want, motherfucker.  And it's like, you gotta, like, you just gotta go, yo.  All right, listen.  I want to break in here, because here's the real question Brian's got in South Carolina.  Brian.  Yo. 
[00:32:00]  Go ahead.  Ask Patrice your question.  Patrice, man, I just want to know, how come it's like every time I go,  it's not every movie, but it's every, like, if it's a horror movie, why do the shwoogies  gotta act up?  Is it genetic?  I mean, it'll be like somebody gets killed.  Oh, damn motherfucker right there.  Oh, shit.  Well, I'll tell you what it is.  Yeah, you guys like to comment, man.  Black people like to comment at the movie theaters.  I don't mind the comments in a horror movie, because it is funny.  I've heard some funny shit coming out of a theater in a horror movie. 
[00:32:30]  When you go, oh, no, don't do that.  You know, it's a cliche, hack, like, joke, but it is funny when it's happening, and it's  not an involved movie.  I'm talking about a movie, maybe you gotta keep some tabs on the beginning, or what's  happening, and some bitch is on her fucking cell phone talking like everyone wants to  hear this conversation during the movie.  But it's only the young cats, man, because movies are $12 now.  Oh, you get somebody like my age, you don't see black people my age. 
[00:33:00]  Black people my age are doing what white people, I do what white people do now.  Oh, God.  You know, it's just like...  Can't we just sit and watch this feature?  Please shut up.  But it's like, it's a whole culture of the movies for young kids.  You go out, you spend $10 if the movie stinks.  You just want to talk.  You want to have fun.  It's an event kind of thing.  I think white people, you know, the fact that, you know, white people will visit the theater  from time to time, and it's like a quiet event.  White people are just quiet for some reason. 
[00:33:30]  Just want to watch the movie.  Maybe I'll take it back, and, you know, I'll rephrase this.  Not necessarily black.  It's an age thing, I believe.  Because I was a loud motherfucker at the movies, and I was fucking funny loud at the goddamn  movies.  But I think now, as you get older, you get like...  Yeah.  You're right, it is an age thing.  But when I went to go see King Kong, I'm in some Jewish movie theater, and there's  about five kids, had to be anywhere from 12 to 15 years old, sitting in the back, wouldn't 
[00:34:00]  shut the fuck up.  Wouldn't shut up.  White.  White kids.  Oh, white.  Yeah, white little Jewish kids.  But they're laughing, cell phone, yelling at the screen, talking, making jokes, wouldn't  shut up.  And a lot of shh, shh, shh, going on from the theater, and they're like, yeah, you shut  up.  You, you know, oh yeah, like, we're going to be quiet.  Being very disrespectful.  Say what you want to be, motherfucker.  So that was when I, I, I turned around, and I said, on behalf of the theater, would you 
[00:34:30]  shut the fuck up?  Now, I never would have done that if there were black or Puerto Rican.  On behalf.  Never.  On behalf.  And I got a smattering of applause from the, uh, from the theater.  Fuck it, Anthony.  But because I knew that Jewish kids from greatness are not going to pull a knife out, they're  not going to start shit. 
[00:35:00]  I could box them all.  Yeah, you assess the situation and then decide what you're going to do.  You assess the situation.  Whether you're going to shut up or, or be a brave man.  You don't have any, your girl got big mouth stories?  Well, we were in Philly once, uh, driving on, what's that, South Street or whatever it's  called, and, uh, we're behind some, uh, some really tough looking, uh, motorcycle dudes,  and they weren't going fast enough.  You know how that road goes nice and slow?  Yeah.  And we're missing lights and stuff because they're going slow and starting up their bikes.  They're, they're out for a little joy ride and just kind of taking in the scenery.  So we're behind, uh, the motorcycles, and, uh, she reaches over from the passenger seat 
[00:35:30]  and decides to start beeping the horn to make them go faster.  Oh, no.  So I can relate to everything you just said.  What did you say?  Because I'm like, are you kidding me?  They're not going to beat you up.  First of all, now they think I'm beeping because I'm behind the wheel, you know?  And you, I'm like, you're putting me in a bad situation here.  And you're not a pussy.  I'm not.  For doing, for like, completely getting as tough as you should be with the bikers.  Right.  With her.  Right.  Like, are you out of your goddamn mind for doing that? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, because at that point, just like you said, you know, the next thing is, well,  what, what, what happens next?  They get pissed off.  They're going to go to the passenger, uh, window because they think you're doing it.  And you're not going to go, that was this bitch that beat me.  Right.  And I would.  I'm like, this bitch beat the horn.  No, they're going to get right up in my, uh, my grill.  And you know what would happen if you do that?  If more men stop thinking this, this chivalry shit and go, this bitch reached over and beat  the horn, dude.  Do you know where he would go?  My bitch is goofy like that.  Yeah.  Walk away. 
[00:36:30]  This stupid bitch beat the fucking horn.  Let's go to Massachusetts.  Chris, what's up?  I'm just kind of sick and tired of hearing Patrice use the entitlement excuse every time  he talks about women.  Yeah.  See, this is a, this is a empathizer.  Sympathizer.  You're the reason why life is fucked up for men right now.  Goofball motherfucker.  You got to learn.  It's a, when I say entitlement, it's a thing that makes you think that there's a magical  force around you that can protect you from different situations that makes you behave 
[00:37:00]  irrational.  Guys don't do that.  Like you would never like, okay, right now you, you're talking to me over the phone, but  if you was sitting next to me on a train or something like that, and you was with your  wife, your wife would say something before you did.  You know why?  Because she has this protective thing around her.  You wouldn't talk because we're both men and it's possible somebody could get choked.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't, you could choke me.  I'm just whatever.  We can fuck each other up. 
[00:37:30]  That's why we don't come out of our mouth to each other.  Now the superior physical, physical person in this, in this, in this situation, which  is the man, why don't we come out of our mouth to each other?  Why don't we curse each other?  Why don't I look at you and go, what the fuck?  Yo dude, why don't you shut the fuck up?  You know why?  Because we are in charge of physicality.  Women aren't.  They go, why don't you, I'm going to beat the horn, because he's not going fast enough  in my fucking world.  This is what I mean by entitlement, dude. 
[00:38:00]  It's frustrating.  You got to understand, you haven't raised as many women as I have.  You're not a father.  Daddy's for trees.  Yeah, you're not a good daddy.  I'm trying to tell you, man.  You got to get that off your mind.  You act like the black Dr. Phil.  Well, hey, don't get mad.  I like that.  You enjoy Dr. Phil.  Why I enjoy the black one, motherfucking shit?  Hey, I like Patricia's, you know, view on the world, man.  Is he more qualified than I am?  He just got a couple of papers. 
[00:38:30]  I'm too lazy to go to school and actually get validated.  But the word entitlement, I might run it in the ground.  I'm not fucking Captain Dictionary.  That's the word I use, and that's the word that I embrace.  Entitlement, man.  You got to understand that it's your fault, and guys like your fault, for us being in  spots where you can get beat up by a biker, stabbed by a family of Puerto Ricans, smacked  in the face by some dudes.  You got to tell your girl, look, if you're not going to fight, if you can't fight, if 
[00:39:00]  you're not going to whoop this guy's ass in your own mind, in your own credit, shut  your mouth.  Shut up.  All right.  Let's go to Frank.  There you go.  Let's go to Frank.  Look at the consequences.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  We're going to try to move on, because we have so much to do today.  Frank, what's up?  Just wondering, especially you guys coming from Long Island, have you guys ever made the  mistake of going to a movie theater the night a black movie premieres and you don't know  what's happening?  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  I'm going to go do that now.  I am going to go do that knowing I could give a shit about the movie just to experience 
[00:39:30]  it.  Experience the whole thing?  Yeah.  Because I can only imagine now.  Absolute culture shock.  You walk into the place.  The place is fucking mobbed.  It's a zoo.  And for the first time in an upscale Long Island movie theater, there are security guards  everywhere.  If you don't know where the hell they came from, it's insane.  It is a little weird going through metal detectors at a movie theater.  That's a weird thing to have to do.  Oh, absolutely.  Where am I going?  Take your shoes off, please.  Could you run them through the metal detector?  I am absolutely going to do that now. 
[00:40:00]  Good luck, Hope.  Good luck.  Good luck, bro.  No, I'm not going to go there hoping to see a good movie.  I just want to see the theater and how it reacts.  All right.  We've got to move on.  It's raining stuff.  Holy shit.  Hallelujah.  It's raining stuff.  It's raining things.  Anthony made a video.  Well, like a quick little flash thing.  I made a quick little flash thing.  Yeah, where it's just Patrice walking down the sidewalk with, like, heavy hardware falling  from the sky as he's singing, it's raining stuff. 
[00:40:30]  It's raining things.  I listened to the replay yesterday and was, you know, I mean, I'm here for when it's happening  and I'm laughing.  Then I listen to the replay and I'm just laughing my ass off.  I told the boys to isolate this.  We've got to play it again, but we need the big setup.  The big setup.  The big setup again.  It was, we were watching or listening to clips of American Idol and there's a bunch of,  you know, faggy guys and there was one exceptionally faggy guy, looked like a woman, looked like  a girl, and he decided to sing a girl-oriented song. 
[00:41:00]  This has been done.  Guys have sang girl-oriented songs, but you always got to change the girl-oriented part  to make it guy-oriented.  If she's saying my guy, you have to sing my girl.  Right.  Things like that.  Perfect example.  But this guy didn't care.  He just was singing a song about being a queen and on his knees and it was just, he didn't  care about changing the words.  I got the thing that you need.  My pussy's wet.  My titties are open. 
[00:41:30]  Stick it in me.  I'm the queen of the night.  Oh, yes.  Now, I never, ever thought it could be done, but It's Rainin' Men, one of the gayest songs  ever.  I've never even heard it attempted by a man because it just cannot be changed into a man's  song.  Right.  But it was done here yesterday by Patrice O'Neal.  Yeah, Patrice, yeah, did the song.  Why is Danny Bonaduce on TV with a broken arm? 
[00:42:00]  Change the words around.  When child stars fall off.  Maybe we can get this audio because...  Because Leif Garrett just got arrested.  Yes, and now the guy talked to all the old child stars that have been in trouble.  Wow.  But why is Danny Bonaduce, he has a broken arm now?  Oh, jeez.  I thought he cleared up all his problems at the end of that celebrity show on VH1.  His wife probably mouthed off in a fucking movie theater.  So anyway...  He was trying to get his shit together.  Patrice off the cuff yesterday decided to sing It's Raining Men, but of course he's not  going to sing It's Raining Men, so he's changing the lyrics so it makes sense that 
[00:42:30]  a man would sing It's Raining Men, and he came up with this.  It's raining stuff!  Yeah!  Hallelujah!  It's raining things!  And it's all wet out here!  Tall on!  Ah!  It's wet out here!  Rough and tough!  It's wet outside!  It's raining things!  Oh! 
[00:43:00]  You gotta change the words to this.  Ah!  Wow!  It's raining stuff!  Let yourself get absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah!  It's raining!  Yeah!  It's raining all!  Hallelujah!  Oh!  Oh!  Ouch!  Oh!  Ow!  Ouch and ooh!  Watch out, motherfuckers!  Ooh!  Yeah!  Raw for Jesus! 
[00:43:30]  He was a bad motherfucker  And he had to do what he had to do  Rearranged the sky  So that each and every brother  Can get out there and do  It's raining stuff 
[00:44:00]  It's raining things  Watch out  Shit is flying around  What the fuck was that  Some heavy shit flying around  Watch your shit  Watch your shit  There you have it from yesterday  That thing just makes us laugh really hard  That is a hit  That's a hit song 
[00:44:30]  It's raining stuff  It's raining stuff  It's raining things  It's raining stuff  It took the gayest song and just made it where every man can now listen  Every man can now sing that song  Oh yeah  And not worry about their sexuality  It's raining things  It's raining stuff  Some shit falling from the sky  Heavy shit  I'm going to sing about it  Well Anthony did a quick little thing  It's up on opanthony.com  You just see Patrice and stuff has fallen from the sky  And it just says across the screen 
[00:45:00]  It's raining stuff  Hallelujah  It's raining things  God damn  Very good  The other thing from yesterday  And man our listeners are quick  Jesus  We love our listeners  Absolutely  Amazing  You must have millionaires  You have to have entrepreneurs that listen to the show  Like  Because it just happened yesterday  Yeah  And they have the equipment  The means  To just like  My god  The one thing people  When they do talk about this radio show  They talk about how interactive this program is  And how like the listeners are really really involved with the radio show 
[00:45:30]  Like no other show out there  I mean we allow the listeners to become stars basically  On a daily basis  And yesterday we pulled a new bit out of our asses  And it worked  And I think we're going to do it again down the road  We were taking a look at the top country songs in America  And we had a lot of fun with that yesterday  And then we like started goofing and singing a country song called  With Clean Hands  Do you want to set this up too?  Another making up the friggin song shit that was going on 
[00:46:00]  Basically we don't know country music whatsoever  So we got the top country songs in America  We got the title of the song  And then we all had a discussion trying to figure out what the song was about  And we played the song  And what was With Clean Hands  What song was that about remember?  It was the number six  It was the guy  The Dierks Bentley?  It wasn't Dierks Bentley  It was somebody who had a duet with  No it was the guy  Remember the guy you said  You said it's just a love song 
[00:46:30]  Where he goes  The good looking dude  That I said he could sing  I know which one it was  Where's the list from yesterday?  It'll be easy if I see the list  What song it was  Cause it was  You listen to that  And then the Dolly Parton duet came on  Right  With the guy  But it was the song before that  And the Dolly Parton song  That  When I get where I'm going  Oh yes that's it  Billy Carrington  Must be doing something right  Thanks guys 
[00:47:00]  Must be doing something right  So we're thinking  What could that song possibly be about  And we went off on a tangent  About how  The guy must be clipping his nails  Before he goes in  Cause he's got a chick  He's getting a chick  His life has fallen into place  He must be doing things right  And yeah  Figured it was you know  Cause it's country  He probably just cleaned his hands  Before he touched his  Woman's genitals  Her vulva  Her vulva  Vulva  I know  We said vulva  And uh  Yeah  With clean hands 
[00:47:30]  So with clean hands  He's touching her vulva  And that's what he's doing right  And that's special  And that's what we guessed  The song was about  So we had fun  And uh  You guys  I think it was Anthony  Mostly  Was singing uh  His version  It was a duet  Oh no  Patrice was in it  Yeah  And uh  You guys were going back and forth  Doing with clean hands  As a country song right  Well the listeners  Figured it upon themselves  Overnight to come up with  Country songs called  Clean hands  They always do  We got two of these in  We didn't even ask for these  I think these are well produced  Or something too  Jeez 
[00:48:00]  Yeah they do a good job  So the first one is by  DJ Newstyle  Listen to this  I wash my fingertips  And trim my fingernails  I light a candle  And I whistle  And wait for you  To come over  And put me through hell 
[00:48:30]  Bedroom door bursts open  And there you stand  I try to show restraint  Despite my swollen gland  But oh  I'm gonna take my time  Slowly rub it right  I'm gonna lay you down  And touch your vulva  With clean hands  Don't need no finger grease 
[00:49:00]  With clean hands  I'm gonna touch that pretty crease  With clean hands  Could be a country song  Gonna rub your little cooter  With clean hands  God damn you stink  But I got clean hands  That could be a country song  It is DJ Newstyle  It is country as anything 
[00:49:30]  It's no different than anything  We listened to yesterday  Isn't that great?  Sensitive  Tells a story  Got washed his hands for us  Washed  Just going off a little something  We were talking about yesterday  Yeah  And then we got another one  From Anthony Sanchez  From Vegas  His clean hands song  Always sensitive  These songs  Because you're taking time out  For the girl  You're wortion  I didn't think 
[00:50:00]  It could happen to me  That I'd actually care  About hygiene  That it might be wrong  Leaving grease on your thong  When I'm digitally  When I'm digitally  Trying to enter  Your gas  It ain't the trash  And it ain't no place  For dirty fingernails  But my hope 
[00:50:30]  It's ivory soap  And I'll do my best  To remove the snail  With clean hands  And I didn't blink  Didn't care  About the stink  When I dirtied up  All of them vulvas  And I never cared 
[00:51:00]  Wipe my dick  With their hair  When I kick them all out  Of my mobile home  That is your gas  But I ain't no trash  And it ain't no place  For dirty fingernails  My hope  Gets lava soap  And I'll do my best  To remove the snail  With clean hands 
[00:51:30]  No more hangnail  Hysterectomies  No more hand  Hell that is  Infecting me  No DNA  From hookers 
[00:52:00]  And spraying  Piss on me  Radio is free  And so is HIV  Jesus  I didn't think  It's epic  Fucking epic  That I'd actually care  About hygiene 
[00:52:30]  And clean hands  There you go  Anthony Sanchez  From Vegas  And his clean hands song  That's a hit song man  Almost  Almost sounded like  It had a little bit  Of that  Didn't it a little bit  A little bit yeah  So  Bravo to the listeners  That's unbelievable  This is like a real song  In like one day  Yeah they took it upon themselves  To kind of go with it  Clean hands  We love when that happens 
[00:53:00]  With the twang  Alright  Twitchels is here  We haven't talked to Twitchels  In a while  He's gonna come in  And help us out  I guess  I don't know  I don't know what the hell  We're gonna do with him  Today  Yeah  We usually have him  Come in with Big A  Right  But Big A  But where's Big A  He couldn't make it today  What is he  What could he possibly  Have to do  His job  His job probably  It's fucking on him man  Maybe we can get him  On the phone  I don't know  Jealousy  Jealousy  That's what it is  Yeah  Eric from Kentucky

[00:54:00]  A lot of people  From a lot of places  Around the country  That's why we call it a virus  It just slowly but surely  Is spreading across America  It spreads  It builds  It's the one virus  We get on  And from the time we got on  When we were two pieces of shit  That had been fired for two years  And pretty much  Exiled to the radio trash pile  People have their doubts  But now it is building and growing  And you can feel it 
[00:54:30]  Feel the people  That there is a lot of fans  Out there  Unlike somebody  Let's say  Who is at the top  Of their game  And then  You know  Years later  You end up on satellite  And you have a big push  And then where does it go  From there  It goes  Where does it go  Down I guess  It just goes down  It's not a building thing  And we still want to do five  You know  Days a week of radio  Yeah  And we work more than nine months a year  Uh huh  Wait till that story comes out 
[00:55:00]  Love to see how he's going to spin that one  I actually was going through the channels last night  And VH1 had private parts on  Believe me  We've stated enough times  How much I cannot stand  Fucking Howard Stern  There are some funny ass parts in that movie  God damn it  Paul Giamatti's hysterical  And uh  I rewound and play that  And he knocks the carts over onto the record 
[00:55:30]  But then you just gotta watch the parts that you know is bullshit  And sensitive Howie  And then how self-centered and egotistical do you have to be  That he had to transform himself into the Howie from 95  When the movie came out  The look  Years before in actual history he looked like that  Where was the fat little Afro Jew Howie 
[00:56:00]  With the big walrus mustache  That he had up until like 1985  They had him at like DC 101  Uh with the long hair  Trying to be the cool Howie  Uh years before he was uh was there  A lot of inaccuracies  They also played at the same time  It was on the sci-fi channel  No nothing  Nothing  All right  Well we'll break it 
[00:56:30]  We'll continue  We gotta talk about Star Jones when we get back  She's at it again  Talk about entitlement  Holy shit  Wait  This woman thinks the world should be delivered to her  On a silver platter every single day  Wait to hear what she has to say about Osama Bin Laden  Oh is that a news tease?  Wait till you hear what she has to say  We'll tell you after this  That's right  Let's say hi to Tom in West Virginia 
[00:57:00]  Tom what's going on man?  You know I just wanted to tell you  I like the guy stuff  I just got my XM like four days ago  My boss put it in my truck  You got some dedicated listeners  I'm in New Mexico  Stopped at a truck stop in the morning  I'm a trucker  Went in to go to the bathroom  You know and I'm sitting down  I look on the walls  And I see Opie and Anthony in the morning 
[00:57:30]  Written all over the bathroom stall walls  Man  I just wanted to let you know  That's how dedicated your fans are  They're willing to take this sense  To let everybody know where you're at  Well that's part of the marketing campaign  The truckers took it upon themselves  To write messages in the bathroom stalls for us  Well I'll tell you what  Because they all have the XM  So it's a matter of turning them on to the channel  Well see if you would send us some promo stickers or something  Man we could stick them everywhere  I kind of like the underground thing  Yeah that's what I'm talking about  We like the grassroots thing 
[00:58:00]  That's why we call it a virus  Slowly but surely our listeners do things to help us out  Well hell with it  I'll just call Uncle Vic and get me a pen and go to work  Alright thanks Tom  Alright appreciate it  There he is Tom in West Virginia  Alright Star Jones in  I wouldn't call it in trouble  She's just showing her stupidity today  And she's done it so often that people just accept it  Do you ever watch TV just to be pissed off?  Yeah I've done that  I search out the view almost on a daily basis to be pissed off 
[00:58:30]  Annoyed  Because these are the dumbest broads on TV  Absolutely stupid  They're tackling the hard hitting issues of the day  The only one that's worth watching is Joy Behar  She's very funny  And she doesn't give a shit  And she's just all about having fun  She doesn't take herself seriously  The rest of these women think they are the smartest women in America  They just stick to like talking about tampons and making coffee  Maybe  Right?  Right men?  They just do psychobabble about the dumbest shit 
[00:59:00]  The second they start talking about politics  Or anything  That really has some substance  Or makes a difference in anyone's life  That's when they get into trouble  Well the post is telling  Talk about shoes girls  Yeah  Let's talk about shoes  Talk about something you know a lot about  Yeah  Well the post is  Telling Star to zip it  Somebody tell Star to zip it 
[00:59:30]  Uh oh  I say let her talk man  Because it's entertaining to me  Harsh language  I start yelling at the TV and all that crap  You watch TV to get mad Patrice ever?  No  No?  No  No  That's redundant you know what I'm saying  You just watch it and something will make you mad  Something will piss you off  Yeah  But a lot of people if they see something that's pissing them off  They'll turn the channel  That's when I start really focusing  And I don't know what it is  I like to get pissed off at the TV  I have a hard time watching things that are cringeworthy 
[01:00:00]  Like not so much things like cringeworthy on this show  But things that you're watching and go  Oh you're embarrassed  Like American Idol  You're embarrassed for people and can't watch  No that I can  Like maybe one of these touching moments  See Lindsay's like that  I go like oh  Lindsay's like that has to cover her face and stuff  And I'm like no man this is great  I love when people make asses of themselves  Yeah  I love cringe TV  I love cringe stuff in general  I can't turn away but it's pretty rough sometimes  Like American Idol 
[01:00:30]  Did you feel for some of those people  When they were just making fools of themselves  Yeah but that I enjoy  I really enjoy that  Yeah  The greatest show in history of the planet  Was that show on WB  That had people think they can sing  Oh yeah  That was great  It was the greatest show I've ever seen  I'm so surprised they can't somehow bring that back  Like find some rubes who don't know  That that actually was  They can bring it back Anthony  Yeah  You got these asses in Hollywood  Oh see that's not  Oh you really shouldn't do that 
[01:01:00]  You really shouldn't do that to people  I still remember that one guy that was on there  I remember he was going  Yeah  Yeah  No  No  Like he's saying  Yeah  Yeah  And the judges were all phony  And in on the joke  They're like  Could you add a few no's  Into you know  Your riffing like that  And he's like  Yeah sure I can do that  Yeah  Yeah  No  No  He looked  It was so ridiculous  In one of those embarrassing moments 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  Because he was really serious  He thought you know  He was on American Idol  Nothing  That was a great show  And it was all about making fun of people  And you just can't make those shows these days  Because everybody thinks  They can be like in this game or something  So it was good to see a lot of people  Just get bashed right in the top of the skull  Trying to come and sing in and dancing  What was that show called  Can they sing or something like that  No  Superstar  Next Superstar  Superstar USA  Superstar yeah  What's the name of the show 
[01:02:00]  Genius show  Genius  Yeah  Anything that isn't American Idol  It's like  Have you heard anyone come out of anything  That isn't American Idol  As far as a singing show goes  And there's been a couple of them  That they throw on  You've never seen anybody  That's come out of anything  On TV  That's tried to make someone  A celebrity overnight man  You know the reality shows  You really don't hear it from American Idol  If you think about it  It's just one  Kelly Clarkson's the only one  Really  That's out there  That little  Carrie Underwood 
[01:02:30]  Clay Aiken is making  A fortune  She's got the number one country song in America  I feel what you're saying  But you know  That's the newness of it  You know what I mean  But it's like  When I see a guy  Like say Bo Bice  Right  I go  This guy  Should quit  Right now  So that he can have a career  Because the dude  I think he was  One of the best  He was just great  A great performer  Polished  But he's on that show  And you don't hear from Bo Bice  As much as you should 
[01:03:00]  No  And his edge is gone  Because he's an American Idol  So the edge he needs  To really make it  It's taken away  By the show  That made him a star  Exactly  He's an American Idol  Yeah  Yeah  Well let's get back to Star Jones  So  Star Jones  The View  They were talking about  The Osama Bin Laden tapes  That were released  New tapes yesterday  Some of them making some  It was a smorgasbord of ideas  It seems like he'd been away  For so long  That he hadn't been in touch 
[01:03:30]  With us in a while  And he kind of threw  A bunch of stuff  Into this tape  I like when it's just  Osama going  I hate you  Allah hates you  We will continue  Trying to kill you  Whenever we get the opportunity  But in these tapes  He's hinting that  He might want a truce  With Uncle Sam  Now it's all about  Like pulling out  Now he's got like  Exit strategies for us  And he wants to maybe  Negotiate  On some kind of 
[01:04:00]  Peace scenario  In at least Afghanistan  I think he's sick of  Getting bit by spiders  Running  Just running  He wants out of the goddamn cave  All that money he's got  And he lives in  Fucking bugs are crawling up his ass  Every night  He's getting bit by spiders  Every night in a cave  Going  Man I have a billion fucking dollars  I can get my hands on right now  He's got three ragheads  His job is just to pick the bugs  Out of his beard  Every day when he wakes up  Pick the bugs out of my beard 
[01:04:30]  You  And he's eight feet tall  So you know  He can't even get up in a cave  And stretch  How hard  I was telling Anthony  The second he comes out of the cave  They just have like  Predator drone thing  Set for eight foot guy  Yeah  Like any eight foot guy  It sees  It just blows up  So he can't even leave  The fucking cave  And he's a man  He's a guy  He's a person  You know what I mean  So it's like  These motherfuckers  These anxious motherfuckers  Are like you know  Okay what's the name  What's the day Osama  And he's just like  Oh what 
[01:05:00]  I got to  Can I not take the medical  What  It's fucking Monday my friend  Looks like someone has a case of the Mondays  It's fucking Monday my friend  Martin Luther King birthday my friend  Osama  I am here as your soldier  To do as you command  To kill the infidels  I have not even had my coffee  I have not even had my coffee this morning  And already 
[01:05:30]  You are here to bother me  Doing the thumb and index thing all with eyes  What what what what what what  Um what what  Yes  We still hate America  No  I am not losing my passion for Islam  But one day  I think old dogs getting weak my friend  No don't you ever say that  Don't  Look at him he's picking stones 
[01:06:00]  He tells his boys that he's going to take a three day weekend  Look  I hear you  You will surely be turned into a pillar of salt  Now speak of him in this way  He's probably trying to grow shit  Up in the fucking mountains in Afghanistan  And he's like  I'm trying to grow a tomato  It's just like  A tomato garden  You think at this point he's thinking  Ah it seemed like a good idea at the time  Fuck man  You know why  This huge shit sucks  And this is in terms we can understand  And what we've been talking about 
[01:06:30]  In terms of celebrity  He's not quite as big as he was right after the bombing  That was like his big  Oh he's wanted  But he's not as big as he was right after his biggest performance  Yeah that was in Zeppelin 4  Yeah  That was huge  That was the black album  And unless you got  Now he's like fucking the band Boston  Alright well  We're just sitting here waiting for his next album to come out  And he gave us cool the engines  Thanks Boston  Jeez  Oh like 
[01:07:00]  Okay  Maybe you guys could have like  You know got together a little bit more than an hour  Yeah  Before you made that third fucking album  Holy crap  On the list of horrible motherfuckers  Yeah  Is he in the top five maybe  Is he going to go down in the top five  This guy is definitely  I put him at number two  Well if you can't put him at number two  You got him  Well Hitler's number one  Hitler's number one  He'll always be number one  Fucking Mussolini's number two 
[01:07:30]  No one cares about Mussolini  He made the trains run on time  I put Slobodan Milosevic above Osama  We don't care though  I go with Idi Amin  You're talking world  Idi Amin's in the top five  You're talking world then  You're not talking about how Americans feel about these people  Or how we feel about him  I'm talking about how we feel  Fair enough  Hitler's number one  Hitler's number one  And on the planet  That motherfucker's the Elvis  Of fucked up motherfuckers  I guess Osama  He's the king of terrorism  Well I'm killing all the Jews  We're going to gas them Jews 
[01:08:00]  We're going to gas them  Well so just let me kill some Jews  You can do what you want  But I just want to kill some Jews  The king of evil  The Elvis  You can do what you want  Oh shit  He's the Elvis of evil 
[01:08:30]  Blue suede Jews  Blue suede Jews  So Bin Laden did this latest tape  Aviva Auschwitz  Aviva Auschwitz  He's just the Elvis of evil  But yeah  Osama's just number two  With his audio takes  Okay fair enough  I don't know how history might put him  You know later in the years that go by  Perhaps he'll drop in the ratings 
[01:09:00]  But he's up there for now  You know who's trying to really grab on  Is that Al Zarqawi guy  He's trying to really  Mr. Head  Muckety Muck  Chopping off heads over there  In Iraq  He's trying  He's vying for position  I think he's always going to  As long as Osama's around  Unless he does something to Osama  He's always going to be  Second fiddle  Yeah he's on  It's like the mafia  I bet he wouldn't mind  You know taking him out  Yeah Osama's  He's in the front line 
[01:09:30]  He's in the trenches  And Osama's  Making tapes  He's like  Big Pauly Castellano  Osama  Osama's probably like Big Pauly  And then Al Zarqawi's like  Got him  Got him  Just waiting  Yeah  I think you're right too man  Can you imagine Osama  Living his life though  Wondering if this is the day  That one of his guys  Close to him  Is going to rat him out  Every day  Because like you said  No matter what you think  This guy is a human being  And what's going through  His head on a regular basis  And with the rewards  That are out there 
[01:10:00]  Like they're all living in shit  To protect this guy  And they know  If they turn him in  It's a palace  Wondering if today's the day  They find the cave  Or you know  I think they would've did it  I mean it's what is it  Up to 50 mil  Or some crap like that  But you gotta think  That they have to know  Where he is  But anybody that knows  Where he is  Is on the list  Yeah  Those people have people  Like they communicate with  Not one person  Slip it up and go  And guess what  He's up in this hill 
[01:10:30]  Right behind me here  Yeah but  It waters down eventually  Terrorists have friends  That aren't as much terrorists  And they have families  And that guy's  There's a  I'm just saying  There's gotta be  Here's a chain  Right here  Here's a chain  Of linking  Osama bin Laden  To  Us  Six degrees of bin Laden  Six degrees of bin Laden  He was in front of  A camera  Or in front of  A tape recorder  Taping his latest statement 
[01:11:00]  That had to get  To Al Jazeera  Right  Somebody  That was with  Osama bin Laden  Had to physically  Take the tape  And go somewhere  Right  Why can't we get  The NYPD  You think they're emailing  You can easy do this  This is  This is  I mean  You know  I think  A little  Paranoid ways  Of just doing things  Right  I think that  You can  Kidnap  Somebody  Blindfold them  Drive them  To 17 hours  Up to the 
[01:11:30]  Afghan hills  Give them  Give you a tape  You know  Drive you back  Give you that  Say  Give it to  And those people  Those people  Are sympathizers  And they'll just  Give it to Al Jazeera  And not even know  I do not know  My friend  They took me  Blindfold  But that's the story  The news should be doing  Is you know  How they got that tape  Well we got it  From this guy  Well  Do the drug thing  Find that guy  Do the drug thing  And then find out  Where he got it  And find out 
[01:12:00]  Where he was  Can you  You think  They can't even  Trace  Who bootleg  Transporter to  In Chinatown  You think they can  Fucking  Like find  They cannot find  That person  This is a little  More important  Patrice  I'm just saying  Transporter too  They want  It's big  They want it  Just as  As cost of money  In this country  Things that cost money  You know  Is just as  Important  Two guys  Take two guys  Put them on  Each side of the door  At the Al Jazeera building 
[01:12:30]  And look for some  Suspicious looking guy  With a fucking  Videotape  Yeah  Then you grab him  And go  Where'd you get that from  Where'd that come from  And then he'll tell you  And then you go to that guy  Who you don't think  They thought of that already  Not saying that you're not  A genius  Anthony  Or Opie  You don't think  They thought of that shit  But the news should do  The story on this  Like you know  Why they can't trace  This tape to anything  He comes down  He's the tape  My friend  And then he  He just walks away  And they go  Okay follow him  He just walks  They follow him for six months  To some  Nothing  Some T-joint 
[01:13:00]  Right  Nothing  Cause they're busy  Kidnapping another person  Dibber  Dibber  Dibber  Alright  Well Nino's got a good one  Here from Jersey  Nino  Yeah what you need to do  Is send Dirk Bentley  And take that  Dirk Bentley  I'm a new mission  For Dirk Bentley  We must follow the videotape guy  And find Bin Laden  And here's another conspiracy  I'm Donald Brooks  Good to see you  I am head of intelligence 
[01:13:30]  With the CIA  We're looking for the Bin Laden tape  Donald Brooks  Most American  Fucking names  Dick  Could you name the guy  A German fucking name  In one movie  Really  Yeah just a few syllables  Make it a little believable  Anthony Stevens  Pleasure to meet you  I'm here on  Grave important espionage  Where's the Bin Laden tape 
[01:14:00]  Alright so  Everyone's discussing  The latest Bin Laden tape  And he hints on this tape  That he wants a truce  With Uncle Sam  Some kind of truce  And you know  Intelligent people  Aren't buying that  Horse shit  No the American government  Was very quick  To come out and say  We don't even negotiate  This is not even  In the realm of possibility 
[01:14:30]  Right  Go fuck yourself  So that's the one thing  About this  Well I like this country  For a lot of reasons  But that's one of those  Those things  Those precedents  That I really do appreciate  Is that they don't  Negotiate with terrorists  If you are caught  You are in deep shit  You think behind the scenes  Some kind of covert  Little maybe chat  With someone's going on  Not at  It's possible  Happened in  The Iran Contra  Well we do illegal shit  Like that  Sometimes you kind of  We're not directly  Negotiating with the terrorists 
[01:15:00]  We're negotiating with this guy  Who's negotiating with  We need a drug dealer land  Intermediary  Right  Just to fly planes  But I mean  I think it's  I think it's  You know that's  One of the best things  Because I think  If you negotiate with them  Oh it's over  Then that means  It's just  Everybody's just going to  Start doing  Fucked up shit to them  That's money in their pocket  Right there  They know how  Then they know  What they got to do  To get us to fold  Is to kidnap people  Chop their heads off  And then we'll give in  Well here we go  Star Jones  Stupid 
[01:15:30]  This is what she had to say  About the tapes  Now if you're the president  And you hear this audio tape  Particularly if they  Prove that it is his voice  What do you do with that?  I'm annoyed that he's still around  And make audio tapes  Well he is  Maybe  Maybe  Maybe  We don't know  That's annoying  The audience  She's annoyed  They're my heroes  Wow that's really  Going out on a limb  I'm annoyed  And they don't even hear  It's just that there's a rhythm  I've been doing comedy forever 
[01:16:00]  You can really brainwash audiences  You just have to have  A certain rhythm  Just say nothing but go  Oh Osama  You know  Hey uh  I gotta interrupt for a second  Mike from the Bronx  NBC did describe  How tapes get to Al  To Zero  Mike  Hey what's up fellas  What do you got on that?  Hey there Mike  What do you say Bill? 
[01:16:30]  Hello there you  Beautiful mocha prince  Okay  Go Chris  Alright  You really want it?  Can I have it?  Jesus ain't taking that wheel  Go ahead Mike  They had a system of 25 couriers  They would pass it over the course of 8 to 12 weeks  That's why every time they have the tape  It's referencing news that's 2 or 3 months old  They said a lot of times they might kill a couple of couriers  Just you know  Scare the other ones into keeping their mouths shut  Wow  So it's really hard to infiltrate 
[01:17:00]  Can you imagine your pick to be a courier?  Like oh no  Oh come on man  Thank you for dishonor?  Oh come on  Imagine  Take this  Take this  Or you're fired  What?  You're going to kill me anyway  Yeah you think your job sucks  Can you imagine?  You're pulled aside  Guess what your job is today  No  Oh Sama has made a tape  It must get to Al Jazeera  We have one tape that is his

[01:20:30]  Oh my goodness  The courier game  Yeah that's got to be awesome  Big money  Big money  Big money  No whammy  Accurate tape  Accurate tape  That's great  Alright let's get back to the view  And these dopes  Right  Star Joan especially  I mean sure but beyond that  Let's say it is his voice  Once you get beyond being annoyed  What do you do if you're the president  With that information  I think you investigate it  And then you can't give it too much weight 
[01:21:00]  I mean if we  If we gave that much weight  To every single threat  That came through  We'd be in a lot of trouble  You can't just open up the land  And give it to Osama bin Laden  So that they can then use that  To train troops  And then really attack us  Four years down the road  I agree with you  That by the way  Is the right answer  That is the only answer  But now I'm only thinking  Of Patrice going  Blah blah blah blah  Blah blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  That was from the chick  That used to eat bugs  For Survivor 
[01:21:30]  Really?  Yeah  That was the right answer  Oh the dispensable one  Absolutely  The one that they replace  Every so often  Yeah  The young one  Yeah the young one  That doesn't deserve  An opinion  No that's how they treat  The young one on that show  You're too young  To actually have a real opinion  But we'll listen  To your cute little opinions  And no one listens  You ain't been  Through what I've been through  Honey  Your snatch ain't dry yet  See I think  I think that  See I think that 
[01:22:00]  Yeah that's real cute there blonde girl  But I was a lawyer  And I know  And I married a faggot  I married me a faggot  And lost a bunch of weight  And I think I look good  But my head looks like  A stretched out milk dud  Oh  She and her eyeballs 
[01:22:30]  Holy fuck  I don't know  What the hell is going on  She looks like  One of those deep sea fish  You pull into your boat  And like the pressure  That they're used to living  Yeah it's all eyeballs  Yeah cause the pressure  Cause the pressure  Is that they used to  They used to living  Under the pressure  To keep them all intact  What do you call her  Anglerfish  An Anglerfish  Big Anglerfish  Got a big swarm  In front of her mouth  Star Anglerfish  Star Anglerfish  Looks like a black frog  They're always wet  Like a wet  Like bulldog eyes  She's got  She lost all that weight 
[01:23:00]  Oof  Oh  She looks like  She's melting  Yeah  Oh that's cute girl  But let me tell you  My opinion  But I just want to say  Here we go  More from the view girls  I tell you love  Why would you trust the man  I don't have given us  No reason  But I don't trust him  But I would  Anything that gives me  The opportunity  To seek peace  I'd at least check it out  This Osama bin Laden 
[01:23:30]  Seems like a reasonable man  I think we ought to negotiate  With who?  He said he'd let us go  With who?  We're not at war  Like  We're not at war  With Osama bin Laden  It's like  How do you negotiate  With like  He's not  He can be like  Look we don't  You know what this is  We don't  We don't  I'm not in war with you  I'm just doing  Fucked up shit to you  How can you negotiate that?  He's a criminal  He's a criminal  It's like negotiating  With a murderer  Or a bank robber 
[01:24:00]  Like alright  We'll let you go  It's a  Just don't negotiate  Alright  Watch  Watch  The road warrior  And watch the scene  Where the people  Where Humongous goes  Just leave the oil  And walk away  I will give you  Free passage  Through the desert  Just walk away  And people in the compound  Are like  Hey  It sounds alright  Let's do it  Guy's asking to negotiate  The second you try to leave 
[01:24:30]  What happens?  You got doom buggies  And motorcycles  And crossbows  On your ass  Humongous  Humongous  Lord of the wasteland  Humongous  The Ayatollah  Of rock and roll  Humongous  Big intro  Great fucking  Cack  Humongous  Humongous  And that's  That's what Osama is  Keeps us vicious guys  On leashes  Humongous baby  That's Osama  Humongous  It's humongous  Warrior of the wasteland  Humongous 
[01:25:00]  Alright  More Star Jones  It gets better here  But he's made it very clear  That his goal  The goal of his organization  Is to destroy America  He's made that clear  Well he says  That we're the devil  Right  But you know  People make deals  With the devil all the time  But if your plan  Is very clear  We make deals with people  That we don't like  I mean we made deals  With Saudi Arabia  That's right  We don't like their humor  They have not come out  And said  Our plan  Our goal  Our mission  Is to destroy you  But they figured  It clear  But he's also  Figured out  That it's not working  Maybe he changed his mind  I mean 
[01:25:30]  And I honestly  I mean I think  Maybe we changed his mind  For him  We changed his mind  For him  Because it's not  So you think you negotiate  With terrorists  I don't think you negotiate  With terrorists  But I do think  You figure out  Whether or not  There is a solution  That is diplomatic  That does not result  What do we have to lose  To check it out  Checking it out  Is fine  This isn't a deal  I mean this is more  I read it  It seems more like  An ultimatum  Than anything else  In disguise of a deal  I mean  I don't believe in the ultimatums  Especially from him  Oh my gosh  Oh Jesus 
[01:26:00]  What a babbling ass  She is actually  Considering a dialogue  Diplomacy  With this animal  There's no diplomacy  Oh well  We negotiate  With Saudi Arabia  Yeah  We have trade deals  With them  Yeah  They're ruthless  Motherfuckers over there  You steal something  They'll chop your hand off  A little adultery  Going on  Who knows what they do  Gouge out your vagina  With a  Spade shovel  You know 
[01:26:30]  They're pretty uncivilized  Over there  But  They are a  Sovereign nation  That we deal with  We deal with China  One of the  Human rights in China  It's an abomination  Over there  Those people  And we deal with them  We go there  We smile with their leader  Bush smiles  And they  And they forget about  Their heads being lopped off  We get the panda bears  From there  Yeah  The cute panda bears  The cutest little  Panda bears  They look like  They're wearing  Little masks  That's the biggest 
[01:27:00]  Problem is  And they're adorable  And they are  Ruthless  But  They figured out  They have stuff  We want  And  And we have stuff  That they want  And they're willing  To exchange money  Over it  If terrorists  Came out with  The next big thing  That Americans loved  And we actually  Had a trade deal  With them  All would be forgiven  What do you think  We love  Fucking Japan  After World War II  You think all of a sudden  We went from  Shoving a flamethrower 
[01:27:30]  In a cave  And watching their  Barbecued asses  Come running out  So we could shoot them  We went from that  And a couple of years later  You know the type of  Hatred it takes  To fry someone  With a flamethrower  And then shoot them  As they come running  Out of a cave  That isn't  That isn't  Well it's my job  As a soldier  You hate that motherfucker  You hate everything  Having to do with it  A few years later  We're buddy buddy  Because they're  Sending cars over here  We're sending them iron  There's money being exchanged 
[01:28:00]  And it's profitable  We hated Germany  Same thing  Now we're buddies  Why?  All of a sudden  Our ideology is the same  We put our arms  Around each other  We like swinging  Pewter Steins  Back and forth  To march music  It's all about  Trade  And money  And what can you do  For us  What can we do  For you  And how much money  Can be exchanged  In the process  I don't know  I don't feel like  We're ever going to  Be in cahoots  With Osama 
[01:28:30]  We are with Saudi Arabia  Is what I'm saying  And that's as close  As we are right now  To being in bed  With Osama  Yeah but he hates  He fucking hates  Saudi Arabia  He hates them  Because of  That they're in cahoots  With us  He hated them  Before that though  He just hated them  Anyway  He feels like  They sold out  Islam  He just hates  Them dudes  He hates  He hates  Fucking Saddam  Who we should  Just put back  In office  Yeah 
[01:29:00]  Just put that  Fucking guy  Back in office  I'm all for that  There was no  Insurgence  When that  Motherfucker  Would go in  Your mama's house  And throw her head  Through  One of those  Mud houses  It just  Why did we  One of his sons  Want to fuck  Your wife  And you stand  Up to him  The next day  Firing squad  For you  You think  There's going to  Be insurgents  You think  There's going to  Be bombs  On the side  Of the road  When the army  When the Iraqi  Army comes through  They constantly  Disrespect this country  Because of our 
[01:29:30]  Goofy movies  Because they just  Really think  That we are  We really are  Like they didn't  Do that speech  That whole thing  You know  I have rights  In this country  You can't just  Hit me  You can't just  Kill  They don't believe  That we will go  Do something  So horrible  And the Japanese  Will tell you  Arrest me then  I will be out  In one day  Back on the street  Fucking your women 
[01:30:00]  It's always that  Scene in the movie  He screamed  Like a stuck pig  What'd you say?  I said he screamed  Like a stuck pig  Now you remember  That infidel  When I beat the rap  And he pulls the gun  He pulls the gun out  And his partner goes  Don't do it  It's not worth it  It's not worth it  Yes  Put your gun away  You will not  Shoot me  Alright  Well you gotta hear  The last clip  From Star Jones 
[01:30:30]  This is the one  That'll piss off  A lot of people  We shouldn't make  Those movies anymore  No man  Undermining our shit  Watch how Star Jones  Simplifies the whole thing  Alright  It could be a way  To save face  You know Bush  Is looking for an exit strategy  How could you save face  With him  Personally  You know what  Remember in the Cuban  Missile crisis  When Kennedy made a deal  Behind the scenes  And said oh we'll take  Our things out of Turkey  Blah blah blah  Something like that  He was pointing whistles  Right  Look what happened  Yeah but you know  At some point  One of these men 
[01:31:00]  Has to put it back  In his pants  And zip up the zipper  At some point  You have to do it  I can't talk like that  When we're talking about  Presidents  I'm sorry  And Osama's not a president  I don't think this was  About somebody  Whipping it out  Do you think that  All of our problems  Is about that  No I mean that  Metaphorically  I'm a little tired  Of posturing  Back and forth  You know  You guys are the devil  So we're going  To destroy you  And then they're posturing  You know  But that's exactly  What he thinks  But you know what 
[01:31:30]  He can't destroy us  If we really wanted to  We could make that  Whole place a parking lot  Everybody knows that  That old gag  Holy crap  That old gag  Make it a parking lot  And then what do you do  Who wants to park there  You dumb bitch  Who wants to park  All the way over there  Will there be ferry service  Across the Atlantic  Are we going to be  Shuttling people  Across the  I'm not in complete  Disagreement  What just came out  Of her fucking mouth  Really  That's how we can do it  And it will be 
[01:32:00]  Fucking  Mick-a-la-land  And it will be  Fucking trains  And fake rivers  And if we decided  To do that man  Remember we dropped  The mushroom  We set the precedent  With what we will do  To a motherfucker  If we really feel like it  But what we're saying  And we're sick of hearing  Make it into a parking lot  Because then what  We go there  You know what the age  It's hot over there  For what  There's one giant parking lot  We ain't using that  Before the radio  You could have helped  Put in the air conditioning system  Over there  And fucking  Nice hotels 
[01:32:30]  First of all  We ain't  We ain't never  Using that A-bomb again  What do you do  We are never  Going to drop that bomb again  Just because we did it  In the 40s  That means nothing  It's like  You know what the atomic bomb is  To us now  It's like  Amos and Andy  Yeah it was there  But you sure as shit  Ain't seen it on TV today  It's so politically incorrect  To nuke people  But it  Politically incorrect  It's so  It's worse than  It's worse than any kind 
[01:33:00]  Of racist TV  Al Jolson  Hit the stage sooner  Hello my baby  Hello my honey  Hello my ragtime guy  You're saying Al Jolson  Should drop the bomb  If it gets dropped  It should be dropped  Just dropped it by Al Jolson  I'm going to drop a bomb  Fly over with a big nose art  On the bomber  And Jemima  Flying over the  We'll never do that again  But that's what kept us  I mean that particular move  Kept us where we are today 
[01:33:30]  Right the muscle men  Look at what we did  Look what we did twice  The fear  That we would do that  And again  I mean World War II  The whole Japanese thing  It's like  Remember man  Those people were just  As frightening  To the country  The kamikaze motherfuckers  That whole idea  That this gook's  Going to fly his plane  Into me  Yeah  And don't give a fuck  Don't forget  It's like  We dealt with that enemy  That horrible  Oh my god 
[01:34:00]  Enemy  Before  But the problem was  They were centralized  Had a leader  That if the leader said  Alright  The jig's up  Enough of this  They stopped  They stopped  They did everything  For their emperor  And when  That was it  Dropped a couple  A-bombs  They decided  Stop  There's no  Like one guy  Even if we get  Osama  And he says  Stop  You get him on TV  Please stop  No more terrorism  Against US  It wouldn't stop 
[01:34:30]  There's so many  Different cells  And factions  That's why  This whole war  Is weird  Doesn't work  Like the old school wars  Where we're bombing  Their capital  Right now  Where's the capital  Of terrorism land  Ain't no capital  We'd have nuked  The shit out of it  We would have  Pulled out a nuke  For that one  If they were all here  We live in terrorist land  It's like one big city  You know  They all live there  They do their terrorism shit  And then come  Honey I'm home 
[01:35:00]  You know  Suburbia  You got the call  From who  Yeah  Mike in New Hampshire  Has got a great observation  Mike what's up  Yeah I think  That the nuclear bomb  Is much like the c-word  In a stable marriage  You always get it  In your arsenal  But you ain't never  Gonna use it  But you use it  To do what  That is the last resort  Right 
[01:35:30]  But if your wife  Is  If you had known  To say that to her once  And it crushed her  In terms of like  It was a crisis  And you said  You fucking cunt  And she just went  Oh my god  And you got through it  She probably won't  Get you to the point  Where  Once she knows  You'll use it  She's not gonna  Fucking fuck around  With you  She's not gonna try  To invade Cuba  No more  If you said it  But you don't want  To desensitize  That word either  You want it to always  Have the punch 
[01:36:00]  So you can't use it  At will  Right  You must use  Your traditional  Weaponry  Yeah we can't do it  But if things got ugly  Really ugly  Yeah  We're known to use it  That's all I'm saying  That's what's keeping  China in line  Is that we are just  Known to do  Fucked up things  Yeah that's gotta  Scare the crap out  Of other nations  I mean if it was  China that had dropped  Two A-bombs back in the 40's  We'd still be going  Eh we  They did drop  Two A-bombs  Yeah  I think you gotta 
[01:36:30]  We're still nervous  It just  It's like  Okay  It's like  On 9-11  Those planes  Like he  It's almost like  You go  When you was 10 years old  If you had a bully  And the bully  Punched in the face  Hits in the face  And then  You're 25 now  And he's still  Threatening to punch  In the face  He's not gonna punch  In the face  He just keeps  Using the fact  That he once  Hit you  Right  And it fucked you up  Until you kinda go  You know what  These some pussy ass  Motherfuckers  Now  They thought  We were pussy ass 
[01:37:00]  Motherfuckers  On 9-11  That's the whole thing  Cause we really are  On this level  I gotta get my footnotes  We are because  Our country's not about  Like hardship  Our country's about  Somebody trying to  Live right  Make money  Go in the pools  Get some pussy  Drive a nice car  That's our  That's our thing  But now you made  Terrorism  A part of our thing  Too  Yeah  So you  There's nothing else  You're gonna be able to do  Now  You can't  You're not gonna be able  To fly another plane  Into a building  Cause the reason  I truly believe 
[01:37:30]  Is the reason  It happened the first time  Is cause of movies  Because they thought  We was gonna land  In  We're seeking asylum  We're landing in  Potonga  And we have asylum  You will be let go  And then they did  That fucked up shit  Yeah  So they fucked it  They did the only thing  It  Once  It  That's it  They can't do  Nothing else no more  So these tapes  He knows he can't do  Shit no more  What else can they do  Besides grab a couple  Of people over there 
[01:38:00]  Who's trying to build  Buildings in Iraq  And grab them up  Yeah they're grabbing  The wrong people too  I mean  And it  And it's working for me  It worked for  You don't have to  Cut a head off  For me not to ever  Go to Iraq  Like Colin used to  Colin used to always say  Hey man why don't you come  And I didn't make no bones  I'm not gonna be  Peer pressured  Into getting my  Fat fucking head  Cut off  I'm not going over there  To entertain nothing  Colin's head looks bad enough  Imagine it on a pipe  On a  On a goddamn pipe  Somewhere on a stick  With that half closed eye  And that half  Fuck that

No, no.  No bad tape.  Make it Osama tape.  Please, please.  And Osama tape.  Oh, no.  I landed on 1969 World Series. 
[01:45:00]  That's why I'm quitting comedy.  I'm quitting so I don't have to look at the crowd.  You know, for five, you got to make them laugh every six seconds.  Yeah.  Can I have a moment for you?  Can we talk politics?  Can we have a moment for you?  We're reasonable, intelligent, man.  Hey, let's have a little intelligent comedy.  Try to.  And it's like, oh, man, shut up, motherfucker.  Pops into your head and you want to just blurt it out, can't you, without some idiot?  All right.  After this, we'll do something maybe funny.  Who knows? 
[01:45:30]  Ah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Treece O'Neill in studio.  He's playing the Helium Comedy Club in Philly like all next weekend.  I need tickets, by the way, for your Thursday show.  The real?  Well, you know, I'm not going.  I got Philly friends.  No, I'm saying maybe there should be an ad on the channel that you're going to be playing there.  Because I haven't heard anything about it. 
[01:46:00]  I am so sick of hearing, hey, big beards.  What's up?  That's what you get.  Hey, big beards.  That's what you get for trying to make me fucking be a professional community.  Trying to relate to the Philly guys and their stupid beards.  Like all the other guys, like the Bill Burr who can get in there and rattle off a plug.  Bob Kelly.  Well, Bob Kelly.  What Steve shouldn't do is make you guys do four or five versions of the promo so we can rotate so it stays fresh.  I'm going to say that.  Because I'm sick of you talking about the beards like you're a buddy-buddy with the, hey, hey, cha-cha.  It was just a shout-out. 
[01:46:30]  I might change it.  I might change it.  The beards.  Just because every time it comes on, I'm sitting in here and my asshole starts to fucking...  You've got to listen to yourself a little bit.  Did you hear Bob Kelly's?  No.  He cannot speak or something.  Do you have it?  No, I'm not sitting there.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Hey, what's up?  This is Bob Kelly or Rob Kelly or Robert Kelly or Bobby.  He's uncomfortable in his own skin, this guy.  I love it.  I'm going to be at the Tampa Improv February 9th through the 12th.  This time I'm actually giving you the city. 
[01:47:00]  Did I just say actually, actually?  Steve doesn't help either.  The number is 813-864-4000.  Call them for tickets.  Again, that is 813-864-4000.  Tampa Improv February 9th through the 12th.  Listen to the music.  It's time for the chup-chup.  Steve is a dick.  He puts Matt Albert over my shit.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  The love line.  He's controlling the mood of these fucking things, man.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, big man. 
[01:47:30]  This time I'm actually, actually give the city.  This time I'm actually, actually give the city.  That's not even all the audio.  He's playing low self-esteem music.  Yeah, I play low self-esteem music.  I let these guys tread water in front of the mic for about five minutes, and then I cut it down to about six minutes.  This is where this show is different, because we know that's all just horse shit, so we try to jazz it up with the Fat Albert music and all that crap.  Oh, that was fun.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Hey, everybody.  Hey, Big Biz.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Hey, baby, Don Patrice O'Neal. 
[01:48:00]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  And, of course, of course, all that's added after you leave the studio.  I'm like, hey, Big Biz.  I can do that to your face.  Imagine if I do that.  Hey, Big Biz out there.  Big Biz out there, Big Biz out there, Big Biz out there. 
[01:48:30]  They hit the stage when they're not doing our radio show.  Oh, yeah.  Got to say hi to Gavin.  He's in studio today.  How you doing, guys?  We just like having Gavin around.  He's a big old guy that can kick anyone's ass.  So are we playing high-stack Tourette's out there?  He only comes with me.  I'm just seeing those twizzles.  Gavin always shows up when twizzles or Big A show up.  Is he drinking coffee now, or was he drinking Red Bull? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, we could get him in here real fast.  Yeah, we got him drinking a lot of coffee.  The guys, Danny and, was it Danny, Nathaniel, you helped out with that?  Yeah, these guys, we're always trying to figure out what we can do with twizzles.  Because usually Big A is in with twizzles.  They make a good team.  They're like Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, those two.  His job.  Did Big A lose his job?  No, no.  He's giving him stress.  He's at a funeral or something like that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Delivering the eulogy as the body rots.  And he was... 
[01:49:30]  Come on, the bombing only lasts so long.  He didn't heckle that.  I saw that man, that's awful.  People didn't know him.  Like, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck by him.  He's the best Monday guy.  Tragedy.  Well, listen, there's a lot of people that got their XM for Christmas and the holidays and all that,  so they don't even know who Twizzles is yet.  He's our friend.  He's a comic that has Tourette's.  What's up, Twizzles? 
[01:50:00]  Legit.  How you guys doing?  How was your New Year's?  Really good.  Sweet.  Yeah, pretty good.  Hey, did you see the HBO special on Tourette's?  Yeah, I did, actually.  I'm a member of the TSA, and I was very aware of the video.  The Transportation Safety Authority.  The TSA is the Tourette's Syndrome Association.  Wouldn't that be the Y-T-S-A?  Eee!  Oh, my God.  This should be beefing head. 
[01:50:30]  Why are we letting them sit?  No, is it my fault?  I'm sorry.  I just thought I could see better.  Twizzles, you're not allowed to sit.  Never had a seat in this place.  I'm doing what they're telling me to do.  How did everybody get so evil just now?  We're on the radio.  It's like, when did you get a seat?  No one let you can't sit.  We only let the black guys start sitting.  I think we're going to let you sit. 
[01:51:00]  They told me to sit.  You haven't performed enough yet for us to allow you a seat.  Stand your screeching ass up, man.  You look at me like this.  Choking mad at me.  What's he doing?  What the fuck, dude?  You know.  Well, I got headbutt.  And then move the chair to the border.  Yeah.  We're not.  We're not.  We're not stupid.  If he starts sitting, it might calm him down a little too much.  Right.  And he crosses his legs.  You're on this show for one reason.  And that's it.  Twist your ass up.  Watch he stop.  Hey, fellas.  You know I'm cured.  Get out. 
[01:51:30]  Fucking tried to bash his head against the wall.  Wait, fellas.  Wait.  Now it ain't to rest anymore.  It's just retardation.  That's for me.  At least I get headphones.  I'm happy.  There you go.  Are you drinking Coke?  Are you drinking what you're drinking there?  I've had, so far, I've had four cups of coffee.  This is, excuse me, five cups of coffee.  This is just my first cup of water.  So this is just the time-scarfing again.  We got him addicted to all the coffee and the Red Bull and stuff.  Do you drink alcohol?  I won't do Red Bull again.  I won't do that.  Do you drink, like, alcohol? 
[01:52:00]  Yes, occasionally.  That'll calm you down, right?  Yeah.  A little bit.  So you saw that special?  Yeah.  Did you guys see it?  Yeah, I tuned it in there.  I was hoping, you know, sorry for a few laughs, but it was actually very good and very sensitive  and nicely done.  Cool.  Pissed me off.  I was hoping for just, you know, a bunch of guys like you cracking jokes.  Well, the thing is, less than 50, everyone says the same thing.  Why don't you curse, you know, as much as you should?  And I'm like, well, you should.  Less than 15% of those who have Tourette's actually have the cursing, which is coprolalia. 
[01:52:30]  That's great.  The lucky people with Tourette's.  You could have Tourette's, which is rare enough or just, like, bad enough, or the Tourette's  that make you an outcast of society where you curse.  Andy, I want to ask you this.  If you noticed, if you watched it, if you noticed how some of the kids who were performing  or doing something, like the one kid was playing the piano, the Tourette's didn't bother him  as much.  Oh, yeah.  He was focusing on something.  He went away.  Exactly.  That's what it's like with me when I do stand-up when I'm on the Mac.  I had a drummer.  I had a drummer years ago with Tourette's, and when he played drums, he was fine. 
[01:53:00]  He was fine, right?  Fine.  And then, like, in between songs?  Eee.  You know?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, gotcha.  Hey, uh, you did a comedy show recently, Twitchells, and it sold out because of the radio program?  I tell you right now, if it wasn't for you guys, it really completely shocked me, the  response it got.  Not only did it sell out, they turned about 50 or 60 people away, and the majority of the  audience was 0 and 8 fans.  Our fans are very supportive.  Oh, my God.  They were awesome.  After the show.  They're amazing.  It was funny because after the show, they were actually quoting from past shows that 
[01:53:30]  I've been on, quoting me and stuff, and it's just, I found it really, you know, thrilling.  I really appreciate that.  The show's a lifestyle.  It's not a radio show anymore.  Just to come down and watch this motherfucker spasm another level.  No, in my defense, in my defense, I've got to shut up.  No defense at all.  Hold on, Patrice.  I got to hear this.  A fan walked up to me after the show, a fan of O&A, and they walked up to me and said,  I've got to tell you something.  When I listened to Patrice, and Patrice was saying early on the show, this is what I  think, either the first or second time I was on, they were saying how Patrice was saying, 
[01:54:00]  I'm almost like Carrot Top, using the Tourette's as like a prop.  And you know what?  First of all, I live with it, so it doesn't go away.  Yes, I can manipulate and try to control as much as I can.  A very special episode of Shaking.  Shut the fuck up, nigga.  I don't want to hear your fucking...  But anyway...  About what your fucking fans said to you.  But no, I just thought it really...  Switchy motherfucker.  You said you that Twitchy's has something serious to say. 
[01:54:30]  No, it's not serious.  I just thought it was really cool that they knew it wasn't your best.  Let's go to Josh in Philly.  Josh, what's up?  Yo, guys, how you doing?  Happy birthday, Patrice.  Twitchy's, you better jump out of that fucking seat, you dumb hump.  Hi, how are you?  Get out of the seat.  All right, we're going to make him jump.  So the guys came up with a great idea for Twitchy's today.  Danny, was it your idea?  Both of yours?  Now they're all going to try to take credit.  Well, come on in and explain what you want, Don.  I want to know who blurted it out first. 
[01:55:00]  This is great.  Just when we thought we ran out of things for Twitchy's to do, these guys came up with a  pretty good idea for today's program.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Danny and Thane.  Wow.  He doesn't get old, does he, man?  He does not get old, man.  I love it.  Wow, that was a biggie.  And we're going to have to do some betting a little later.  For the new listeners, let the new listeners try to win some money today. 
[01:55:30]  Let's have some fun bets and things.  All right, what do you guys got?  All right, well, Dan, we were trying to figure out a way to get, obviously, do something with  Twitchels.  And Danny said, well, he needs to not move.  We need to find some way of him not to have to move.  And I said, what about the board game, board game operation?  The board game.  Wow.  You're speaking English now.  What about the board game?  It just needed to be something where he had to concentrate meticulously on something. 
[01:56:00]  Look at you trying to hop on Thane's idea.  It wasn't going to happen, period.  See, we should do it with the mousetraps.  We should do our own game of operation.  Bring in those mousetraps again.  And he has to pull the cheese off the mousetrap very delicately.  That is a good one.  Do we have any of those mousetraps around?  That one guy gave us so many fucking mousetraps.  No?  All right, well, he's going to play operation.  And you also bought another game for him?  Yeah, just in case you guys get bored of operation, we have Jenga.  Yeah, Jenga would be a little rough for him to play. 
[01:56:30]  Just since you mentioned operation, he started to get a bit nervous, wasn't he?  Yeah.  He's freaking out a little bit.  And if he fails, what happens?  Um, well, we subject him to a song that features jumping.  A lot of...  Ah, another jump song.  A lot of jump.  Because when he hears the word jump enough times, he has to jump.  It's one of those things that he has to do.  No, he doesn't.  Look, he's not jumping.  I'm really trying to control it.  See, he's not jumping.  Jump.  Jump, isn't it, man? 
[01:57:00]  Jump.  Now, see, he's not jumping.  He's not jumping.  He's not jumping.  He's not jumping.  What is this?  You haven't heard the jump thing yet?  No, man.  I've been up to control it.  Jump.  Oh, man.  Leave him a lot.  Jump.  Jump.  He's eating his nose right now.  Jump.  Jump.  He's real...  There he goes.  You are joking.  Is it doing that on purpose?  No.  That is amazing.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  He doesn't even know what it is, first of all.  I'll explain in a second, man. 
[01:57:30]  You just jump.  Yeah.  Uncontrollable jumping?  Dude, he brought a friend, right?  What a great friend he has.  Okay.  We're doing all the stuff we do with Twitchels, usually, and we're taking a break, and this guy  comes running up to me and whispers in my ear.  He goes, dude, say jump on the radio.  I'm like, why?  He goes, he can't control himself.  If he hears jump, he has to jump.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  So we tried it, and sure enough, he lost his mind.  So then we played Jump Around, that song Jump Around, and he lost.  He lost his mind.  Oh, if I do go to Mornfield, it'd be funny, wouldn't it? 
[01:58:00]  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  What the fuck?  See, but I can control it sometimes, but for the most part, I can't.  Don't even challenge us with that.  Yeah.  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  Oh, yeah.  He's slowly losing it.  Wow.  He's slowly starting to hop.  Sometimes, man, I have this blast of, like, God, where this is so mean.  No, this is the best man asked.  But it's, like, just a second of, like, oh, my God, just to get abused. 
[01:58:30]  But it's, like, it all comes to a head, and you feel better when he goes, I sold out fucking, you know.  What else?  What else do you do?  That's the price you pay for fame.  Right.  Is you get abused, and then you sell out your shows, and you're fucking fame.  First of all, let me tell you right now.  We all pay.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't, if I was offended.  I mean, I had the best time whenever.  Yes, you would be.  Yes, you would be.  Come on.  Yes, you shakey, pluggy mother.  He's a plug in his money.  He came in here the first time with a fucking children's book. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, I got this.  Shakey, pluggy.  Pluggy, shaky bastard.  He's like, I wouldn't be here if I was offended.  You wouldn't be here if you was offended.  No, no, Patrice, I grew up being 300 pounds having turrets.  I'm beyond the point being offended.  You could be 300 pounds.  You know that.  I can't believe that.  First of all, you were here this time.  Did you know that?  I was 300 pounds.  You used to weigh more than Patrice.  I looked twice his size.  I was 300 pounds.  Because I was, like, 5'10", 5'11". 
[01:59:30]  He showed his stomach.  Remember that?  He got, like, pregnancy by it.  Well, because I lost 85 pounds.  That's why I have all the loose skin.  This is all the loose skin I got.  Oh, damn.  And it's like.  That is the worst six-pack I've ever seen.  But then again.  But then again.  That was horrendous.  He has the fucking six-babies stomach and fucking C-section.  He's got the lasagna scars.  He's got the lasagna and the C-section scars.  That was horrendous.  So, this nigga got ovaries. 
[02:00:00]  He's just.  He's just.  Sing queen in the night.  And that's exactly.  Old.  Great paper abdomen.  Oh, man.  Well, if it wasn't for this skin, I wouldn't have got on Leno.  That's how I got on Leno.  Doing belly ball.  Wait, what's that again?  Belly ball is what I did to get on Leno.  I stick a wiffle ball bat underneath all this loose skin.  And I can hit a wiffle ball if a T-ball stand.  They featured me on Steve Harvey's big time doing that also. 
[02:00:30]  Wait, should we do it on our show?  Yeah.  I remember seeing that.  Can we do that on our show?  It was on a segment called Don't Try This at Home.  NBC flew me down to do the Tonight Show for that.  And it was just.  It was fun.  You know, I figure.  I have all this loose skin.  And the reason why I found out, I was writing one night, and I dropped my pen, and I couldn't find it.  And it got rolled underneath the fat.  And it was holding it there.  Jesus.  But, you know, who cares?  Are you going to get the operation eventually?  I don't have insurance, so it's like I can't afford it.  Our pal Big Kev's getting that exact operation. 
[02:01:00]  My mom just had it done last week.  He lost all that weight, and now he's getting the loose skin removed.  Why?  Well, my mom had the gastro bypass surgery about a year and a half ago.  And just last week, she finally got all the skin removed.  She just got out of the hospital on her birthday last Friday.  And it's all gone.  And they removed all that.  And they said it's really life-threatening.  So that's why I don't want to.  I'm too nervous to do it.  Yeah, that's how, like, ridiculously dangerous surgery is.  Well, if you think of my doctor even said, if you look at this right here, they said I'm really.  Do I have to?  Oh, God.  No, it's like the worst thing I've ever seen in the morning. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, God gave me a shitty hand.  He just looks like a clam that somebody knifed out of the shell.  Oh, God.  Let's get.  Like a raw clam guy just.  Yeah, let's get Sharpies.  We can make faces and stuff on that.  I can do an old person's ass when I do that.  I can do that.  Do girls like that?  I mean, do girls like that?  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I mean, I'm stuck with it.  What am I going to do?  God dealt you a seven-deuce offsuit. 
[02:02:00]  God damn, man.  The flop was melting.  Yeah.  The flop full of color.  This is for anybody who listens and goes, oh, that's just fuck.  It's like, what else?  Like, hip big A, what the fuck else would an obscure version of this mess be?  Like, it's like, imagine him not being on the radio, being fucking verbally abused, and  he's walking in the streets just being him without a fucking radio program out there.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we have an open call for more messes? 
[02:02:30]  Messes.  Just a mess, right?  Yeah.  Next Friday, open call.  You just show up at the station if you think you got something off of this program, like  Twitchels does.  Not less than three fucked up things.  What about missing limbs?  Big A is hideous.  I say we do it all, man.  Missing limbs.  Open call for freaks a week from today.  All morning long.  No line, man.  All morning long, we got the mic set up, and you come in if you think you got something  for this program.  Palettes.  Wow.  Anything.  If you're brave enough to show up with your...  All Stacey Keeches. 
[02:03:00]  Bunch of Stacey Keeches.  Freak Idol.  It's like a freak.  Eric Marins.  And Eric Roberts.  A bunch of Eric Roberts-faced motherfuckers.  And we'll be like...  Joaquin Phoenix.  We'll be like American Idol.  We'll sit here and we'll judge if you got, you know, if you're a mess or not.  You'll be the worst.  Because Big A is another mess.  Get that up on the website.  A week from Friday, we'll be doing an open call.  Open call next Friday.  There's a lot of people in there.  It's a bum.  Just a mess.  Just a horrible looking individual. 
[02:03:30]  And he has...  It's like you have double cursed.  At least double cursed, Obi.  It's just like, oh my God.  What is...  Triple cursed.  Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.  It's only double.  Here's the deal.  It's going to be an open call next Friday.  You've got to get past the people on the street that are going to judge if you have anything  to begin with, then you come up here, then you'll see us, and then we'll discuss.  Gavin, you free next Friday?  Gavin will be here.  Patrice will be here.  American mess.  I'm going to be pulled up.  American mess.  American mess.  That's right.  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan. 
[02:04:00]  Well, well, well.  Dead serious.  Get it up on all the websites.  We do open call a week from today.  You just show up.  You're a mess.  And who would you...  Would you put him in, I say, your all-time three messes?  He's pretty good.  He's one of our greatest finds.  It's the Tourette's and the weight loss that left the belly.  Half a Hulk face would be...  Oh, half a Hulk face.  If he had any type of personality.  Any personality.  What about Big A?  Big A's right up there.  That's great.  This kind of is like American Idol, because they can't just be a mess. 
[02:04:30]  Half a Hulk face, like you said, perfect, but no personality.  I just got to give him off the numbers as well.  I like your half a Hulk face, but your personality is not what we're looking for for American mess, so I say no.  It's fucking awful.  It's coming all nervous.  Yeah.  Guys, get this up on the website immediately.  Open call.  The show's called American Mess.  Next Friday on the Open Anthony program. 
[02:05:00]  Dog, congratulations.  You're going to Newark.  Hey, dude.  Patrice can be like, Rodney.  Dog.  Dog.  Dog.  Yo, dog.  You a mess, dog.  You a mess, dog.  What did you say, Paula?  You kind of a mess.  What are we looking for?  Dog, I was feeling that mess.  I say, look.  I don't say you have to have more than, you just have to be a mess, whatever that is. 
[02:05:30]  I mean, come on.  You could have a missing fucking limb or.  Twitchels, if he was fucking the guy who played Aquaman on Smallville, you know what I mean?  If he's like the guy, like they put on a poster as the best looking dude in the world and he was, and he was, Twitchels had his problem.  That's a, he's fucked up, man.  He's a deep shit.  But he not only has this Tourette's, a severe case of Tourette's, he has a horrendous figure. 
[02:06:00]  Like his figure, it's almost as disturbing as his fucking Tourette's.  And Big A, Big A, his look is as disturbing as his fucking speech impediment.  So, like I said, half of Hulk face is disturbing, but it's like, half of Hulk face is a mess.  Who the hell is this guy?  But like you said, Twitchels, at least he's a comic.  Big A's got the lifestyle, too, that just like is a mess. 
[02:06:30]  He's a cab driver.  And I think all this should be considered, but it shouldn't keep you out if your lifestyle isn't that bad.  It's an absolutely open call, just like American Idol.  Let's see if a guy comes down without a leg.  You'd think everyone, you know, but it was, you know, hacked off in a combine accident.  I didn't even have health insurance, so you had to just duct tape it up.  Yeah.  A duct tape, I'm missing a leg with duct tape on it.  That's a fucking mess.  I don't know if you guys noticed, I have two different color eyes.  I just thought I'd throw that out there. 
[02:07:00]  Jesus Christ.  I was born with heterochroma.  Like a straight cat.  If you look right there, one eye is half green and half brown.  And I was born with, it's called heterochroma.  If someone needs an, like, eight megapixel cam, put it each away from that eye and snap that picture.  Let's get a real good shot of that.  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  Hold still for the picture.  That's going to work.  What the fuck said hold still?  It's going to be a fucking Picasso photograph. 
[02:07:30]  I can't believe that jump thing that was still...  Jump, jump, jump.  Oh, yeah, now he's losing it as far as the jump thing goes.  All right.  So, listen, American Mess next Friday in the Open Anthony program.  Open call.  It doesn't matter what you got.  Yeah.  Whatever problem you have.  Amazing.  Anything.  I mean, what could it be?  You have the wacky voice.  You're missing a limb.  You can smoke cigarettes from your vag.  We don't care what it is.  An industrial accident.  Maybe you had a bolt shot through your head.  You get creative with it. 
[02:08:00]  If you think you got something for American Mess.  American Mess.  Next Friday in the Open Anthony program.  So, that's England.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  We did music and everything.  Yeah.  Oh, Steve will make promos and everything.  Oh, man.  I can't.  The promos should start running immediately on this fine channel.  Steve's good like that.  If you're coming down on Friday, if you think you already have something, give us a call.  We'd love to hear what you think you're missing.  I can't even wait for that.  That's amazing.  All right, Twitchels. 
[02:08:30]  We're going to play Operation with you in a while.  It makes you feel uncomfortable, doesn't it, man?  Hey, and we'll bet on the Operation game.  That's what we'll do.  That's a classic.  What's going to be the conditions of the bet?  How long before he buzzes?  How many body parts do you get out of here?  If you think you can pull it out.  If you think you can pull it out or not.  Dude, I'd say none.  You say none?  But other parts are harder than other parts.  Remember when you was a kid playing it and the wishbone was the easiest one?  The hardest is the rubber band.  How about the funny bone with the rubber band was real hard. 
[02:09:00]  I got it.  We all put the body parts in a hat.  $10 a man, you pick out your body part, and that's the one you're hoping he could get out of the body.  All right.  That's good.  It's very random.  It's like a Super Bowl box.  Take out wrenched ankle.  Right.  It was a wrench.  And then the rubber band was, what was the rubber band?  I think it was.  It was called a body part.  Someone will get it on instant feedback.  That's okay.  That's the best thing about instant feedback. 
[02:09:30]  Because they all had like weird names.  The funny bone.  We might have different names in England, you see.  Then they had the ribs.  Hey, people are suggesting they vote for American mess.  Oh, open it to the public like the real show.  Yeah, we'll get video clips of everybody.  That's a great idea.  That's awesome.  That's the third round.  Isn't that the final when they vote at the end?  Who's the best?  That's a great idea.  That's a sub-tent.  And then that person.  Whoever wins American mess will be part of this program, obviously.  We met Big A just on a sidewalk one day.  Twitchels was brought in by Big Tab. 
[02:10:00]  So I guarantee whoever wins American mess will be a featured player on this program.  You know, I think we ought to give half a Hulk face another chance.  Look at him.  Look at him.  That dude is dead sick.  Look at him.  Oh, shit.  Look at half a Hulk face.  Oh, my God.  Look at half a Hulk face.  Look at half a Hulk face.  All this shit's on opianthony.com.  And does he talk?  Does he talk without...  Can he talk?  He was boring.  Can he talk?  He was boring.  It's like half his body went to Jupiter.  And, like, the gravity just fucked it up and then sent it back.  The nigga got mad. 
[02:10:30]  He was just a little bit mad.  He just went...  All right.  If this guy could sing like Frank Sinatra, we would be off to something.  I'm just a little angry.  Look at him.  It looks like...  Oh, my God.  His ears dropped.  His ear is down on his neck.  Yeah.  I think that's a good point that they have to have something special about him other than  just appearance.  Well, it'll be up to them.  We'll see.  It looks like he's been the densest all afternoon.  Because you know what?  Half a Hulk face, even though he gave us nothing radio-wise, he's given us some great fodder on this  program.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't know what it's going to be.  Very memorable.  Yeah, you've got a point.  Once again, open call next Friday.  You just show up. 
[02:11:00]  It's American Mess on the open at this program.  No rules.  No rules.  No holds, Paul.  If you're a mess, you're a mess.  That's right.  American Mess.  American Mess.  Right after the OC.  I'm going to see the cartoon.  Right after.  Wait a minute.  Right after Dancing with Retards.  He just got on ice.  He's hitting with the stars.  That's what it was.  And you guys just go, dog. 
[02:11:30]  Dog.  And then the guy goes, what?  No, I'm just saying you look like a dog.  A dog.  You're dragging your ass on the carpet, dog.  Dog.  Dancing with Retards.  Hey, we might have to do that, too.  Yeah.  That was good.  All right.  Well, Twitchels, go relax if you can.  Go and sit down.  That's all it's.  True Boogie, you just hanging today?  All right.  You got any remixes in your blood?  You might have to do It's Raining Stuff, you know. 
[02:12:00]  Anthony was suggesting that yesterday.  Oh, my God.  If you could kind of mix to that.  I heard a little bit of it today.  Yeah.  I'll check it out and see what I can do.  Well, a Tourette's wrap.  Oh, that'd be funny.  Very good.  Yeah, that Tourette's wrap could be funny, too.  So, all right, anyway, we should take a break.  We got Gavin in the studio.  Do we have your buddy's audio?  We love playing it every time you're here.  You know what?  I think, yeah, Steve actually took a re-record of it, so I believe he does.  That is so goddamn funny.  It is funny.  You know what?  You should speak to the guy, because he's even funnier. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, he's a great guy.  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  He's funny as hell.  Great guy.  He's funny as hell.  He took a dildo off his ass.  A strap-on dildo up his ass.  Imagine stories.  I mean, the stories, these things he's done, are amazing.  And there ain't no mistake in it.  When you hear it, it's...  Oh, oof.  Gavin, you were in a hotel room with your buddy in this...  Was she a skank?  I mean, was she...  No, she was at the swingers party, and she was at the swingers party.  I mean, these swingers are...  I mean, a lot of fun.  There's no work, you know.  And what is your job at the swingers party? 
[02:13:00]  Just to sit there and laugh?  No, my job is to sit there and sit there.  She's got the greatest laugh.  Gavin has one of the best laughs to take video.  And your buddy's getting it up the poop chute by this chick in a strap-on, and all you have  is the camera phone and your laugh.  That's it, man.  That's it.  He's never...  And the guy's never done this before.  He has never done it before.  He just figured it was time to have a woman strap a dildo on and tag him in the ass with  it.  As I said before, it's a filthy weekend anyway.  So, I mean, I saw a lot of things that weekend that, you know, after a bit, you just stop 
[02:13:30]  being surprised.  Yeah.  I mean, 8 o'clock in the morning and your pal's getting fucked in the ass with a dildo.  Well, you know what?  Hey.  This audio.  You've got to enjoy it.  I'm a big fan of it.  This audio.  It's hard to hear it at first, but then it's very obvious.  Oh, it's so obvious when he gets it.  And when he gets it in the poop chute and the laughing that...  I could not hold myself to give it to him.  How could you not?  Dude, it was hilarious.  All right, let's take a listen to this.  This is Gavin's friend getting it up the ass by some chick with a strap-on. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, it's a sweet laugh, boy.  Oh, no, I'm not a chick.  Oh, my God.  Really?  No, we're doing it.  Let's do it a little bit, man.  That's it.  That's it.  There you go.  Well, it's like we're fucked a bit up.  In your wormhole?  In the camera.  Films, everything like that.  Thanks for having me.  All right, that's it, Dan.  Why don't you fuck?  No, wait, hang on.  Let's get it.  Fuck, man.  Okay, so we've got one of people in the job and Mrs. Guilford going well. 
[02:14:30]  And Lloyd, he's just going to get involved here.  Let me just get this one.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, wait, not me.  Oh.  Oh.  Where's that floor?  I don't know.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't know if I can with this shit.  Huh? 
[02:15:00]  Oh.  What's going on?  Oh.  What's being fucking pushed?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  What's going on in there?  Oh.  Fucking God.  Oh.  What if it dies?  Is it?  It's like my fucking eyes.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, fuck, fuck it up, fella.  What's going on? 
[02:15:30]  What the fuck's up?  Oh, look at what he can do.  Get me a towel, because if he's covered in shit, I don't want it all over me.  He won't tell me all over the towel.  Oh, no. I'm sure you've got to figure it out.  I'll see you there, then.  I'll see you there.  It's pretty good today.  Bam, bam.  He's dead, doesn't he? 
[02:16:00]  Um...  Fucking hell!  Ah, my God!  Get in there, fucking having me idea...  over more funds!  In there, give it a good ride, sir. 
[02:16:30]  There you go.  Get in there later.  Get in there later.  Good luck, good luck later.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  That is one of my favorite clips that we play from time to time. 
[02:17:00]  Fucking hell.  Patrice, we're going to do our own WebJunk20 show.  We're going to get our crazy clips and have people vote on those, too, soon.  It's funny, man.  Oh, man.  I love it, man.  It's funny.  I mean, it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life about a dad.  I don't doubt it.  That is really good. 
[02:17:30]  It's my buddy behind him that's behind her that makes it work.  You know, it's hilarious.  You don't even know.  It's like, you see the video?  It's like, this guy's getting fucking his ass by her, and there's a guy fucking her in the ass.  And the guy's fucking her.  Oh, my God.  This is why hers is...  His thrusts are blasting.  So that's why the guy's going, oh!  Because this guy, you know, is fucking her like an animal and pushing her into him.  He's pretty much fucking him.  Right.  By proxy. 
[02:18:00]  By proxy.  By proxy.  Wow.  We should get the video up on the website.  You want some downloads?  I can't do it, man.  I can't do it, man.  It's okay.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm sorry.  It's all good.  You've shared enough.  It's all right.  I made some good friends, man.  That's great.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll continue.  We've got Gavin in studio, who's just a friend.  I don't even know how to, like, introduce you.  That's nice.  You're a friend of mine, too.  I appreciate that.  And everybody else now.  Twitchels will be playing Operation in a little while.  Can't wait.  I can't wait for that. 
[02:18:30]  Can't wait for that one.  Bam!  I'll do stuff on the way.  Yeah, we'll play America.  You took my funny balls.  I'm going to kill the batteries in the game before the show ends.  You took my balls.  A little sing-along, because we were talking about Osama and American mess that's coming  up.  Osama, is he back out?  Is he bringing in more videos?  Yeah, a little audio tape, yes.  He's like puffed out, isn't he?  I mean, he's got them all, hasn't he?  Hey, I've got a new video today.  What's going on?  Fucking brilliant.  And look at the press he gets when he drops a new album.  That's amazing.  He's got more tapes than... 
[02:19:00]  Does he talk this time, or is he just rapping again?  He's got more tapes than Notorious B.I.G.  Yeah.  More remixes coming out.  You've got to love the guy.  Yeah, he's the best.  He's the best of Hottest Seeker I've ever known in the world.  He really is.  All right.  We're going to play America Fuck Yeah in honor of that and American mess.  All the details will be up on the website soon, but we're dead serious.  Once again, open call next Friday.  Oh, God.  You show up, and we're going to find out who is the American mess.  You're going to have some real people queuing outside there, too.  I'm hoping.  You're going to have the prejudges out there going, ah, you're not met. 
[02:19:30]  You're not enough of a mess.  You're not enough of a mess.  And then you've got to walk away all bummed out because you thought you were a mess.  You comfort those guys from the lower.  Only the biggest messes will be invited up to the studio, and then we'll go from there, okay?  Right.  American mess, coming to the Opie and Anthony program.  If you see me getting high, if you see me getting high, knock it down.  I'm not going to lie.  If you see me getting high, if you see me getting high, knock it down. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  The info for American mess is up on the website.  Open call for all freaks for next Friday.  And we've got to get Ben in here.  He's got a prize, a really good prize.  Ah, see, that's what gets the people out.  For the best two messes we look at next Friday.  I think we're going to have to do open call every Friday for a while because this is going to take time  because I think people will have to, you know, build up the courage to come down.  Yeah.  So I don't think this is going to be a one-time thing, but we'll start next Friday. 
[02:20:30]  We'll see what happens.  But for Friday, Ben, what do we got for the...  Lingerie ball, L.A.  Bowl, L.A.  Whoa.  Wait, but what about the women freaks?  Huh?  Yeah, well.  Well.  What about the girls freaks?  It's a trip to L.A.  It's a trip to L.A.  So don't go to lingerie ball.  It's a trip to L.A.  The heterosexual women freaks.  All right.  How many women do you think we're going to get down here?  Freak women.  You'd be surprised, man.  Obviously, there's a lot of freaks out here.  Look.  If we get a really freakish woman and she's great and she wins the damn thing, trust me, 
[02:21:00]  we'll figure out...  It's a trip to L.A.  And we'll figure out something nice for her if she's that bummed about the prize.  Don't worry about it.  They put you up somewhere?  Yeah.  Hotel.  Put you up.  Nice hotel.  You got, yeah, the airfare.  You're there in L.A.  You get to see the lingerie ball.  Two trips to the lingerie ball, courtesy of bowdog.net, right?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  And that's Super Bowl Sunday, halftime show.  You get to, you know, be in the audience to check out the lingerie ball.  Not being unappreciative.  Plus, you get the trip to L.A.  It's a great prize. 
[02:21:30]  Not to be unappreciative.  Yes.  But here's a question.  Oh, Jesus.  I just want to ask.  Oh.  Feel free.  All right.  Is it two trips for two?  Those trips are two trips, so it's four people can go all together, right?  Four.  You and a friend.  All right.  Two you and a friend trips.  I just wanted to say, is there a fucking horrible human being who's going by themselves to the lingerie?  Right.  All right.  Get that up on the website.  So there's the prize.  That's the real prize.  Two trips to L.A. to see the lingerie ball for the two biggest messes we see next Friday. 
[02:22:00]  Open call when we do American Mess.  Now, you know there's going to be a couple of American Messes that come in here, and we just go,  thank you, and they have to leave.  That's going to be the best part.  Because they're not going to be messing up.  Their whole lives, they've had this thing on them, and it doesn't impress us.  No.  It could be like an Aaron Neville mole or something.  And don't forget that none of the messes, like Twitchells, he doesn't know he's a mess. 
[02:22:30]  Big Kev goes, hey, come on, let me talk to you for a second.  I'm going to bring you on in.  Yeah.  He thought he was coming in and go, hey, I'm a comic.  So real messes, like you're going to get the guy in the blue bunny suit that came down.  Yeah, I remember that guy.  Thank you.  But then it's like you're going to get, like some messes are going to be coming with people who go, hey, let's come on down.  They're not even going to know they're on American Mess.  That's what it's going to take is people that listen, that know a mess.  Right.  And they're going to go, hey, why don't we come down? 
[02:23:00]  We'll check out this radio show Friday.  Yeah.  And they're going to bring the mess and bring them in.  By the way, I'm a little nervous because it's not one phone call from a mess.  Of course you wouldn't get one.  They're out there.  They're sitting there going, where are the big A's and the Twitchell's?  There's a guy there going, I can't wait.  I can't wait until next week to see who's the mess.  We're going to do it so fast.  No one wants to be the mess.  This is a great idea, but I don't know if it's going to work.  Some guys are like, that's going to be funny radio. 
[02:23:30]  That's going to be funny radio.  There's going to be people sitting there, I can do that.  I'm better than him.  I'm more of a mess than his.  Yeah, and they're going to get thrown right out.  Ah, wow.  What do we got?  Oh, oh, oh.  Ozone midget sighting of the day.  Second midget sighting in so many days.  Who saw this coming?  Let's say hi to Rick in Florida.  Rick?  Yeah.  What's up?  I was calling about the midget sighting. 
[02:24:00]  I saw one in Big Springs, Texas.  Isn't that weird, seeing a midget in Big Springs, Texas?  I thought so.  She was, why did she was tall?  Badass?  She's a little fat midget.  Oh, God.  Felt like kicking her right down the steps.  Well, what was she doing?  We'd love to find out what the midget was doing when you saw him.  She works, I guess she works cleaning showers out there at the truck stop.  Oh, good God, Mike.  She had a little tiny, a little tiny big. 
[02:24:30]  Wait a minute, did he say truck stop?  Yeah.  How did she clean trucks with a midget?  Oh, the pieces are falling out.  It was bad.  Oh, my goodness.  One fell in your lap.  Yeah.  You're breaking it, Drew Boogie.  Yeah.  We're going to play Operation a little while, Drew Boogie.  All right, Rick.  That's about all you got?  Yep, that's it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Let's say hi to Matt in New York.  Matt, what's up?  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing us on the phones today. 
[02:25:00]  Let's go.  Matt.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Quick question.  If I bring the mess to you guys, do I win or do they win?  Well, that's the deal you got to make with the mess.  The boss win.  Oh, fuck him.  He doesn't know the difference.  Yeah, like if you bring a mess, it's a trip for two.  There's two trips for two.  So if you bring a mess, yeah.  What if someone brings like a Terry Schiavo and they have no idea?  Oh, wow.  That's an instant winner right there.  All right, guys. 
[02:25:30]  Well, you have a friend that has something different or what?  He's missing a leg and missing an arm.  His whole right-hand side of his body is torn off.  It's pretty funny.  How'd that happen?  It's pretty funny.  How do you say that about your friend?  It was actually a motorcycle accident, but it's pretty fucking hysterical to see him try to get around.  Is he willing to come in?  I'll have to call him and find out.  All right.  Well, we'll see what shows up next Friday.  See you guys next week.  All right.  Thanks, man.  This is the only way that the mess is going to come in is that their friends...  Yeah.  ...help them out. 
[02:26:00]  They go, this is a mess, and they can't even tell him, hey, you want to go on American  Mess?  What?  What are you trying to say?  No, I'm just saying there's a show called American Mess, and I was just going to say you  want to go down there.  Why?  Why?  It's because, hey, no, I'm just saying.  It's a guy that used to call our show.  He got hit in the head by a boat.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  And he survived.  No, he was in another boat, and a boat ran into the boat he was in, and the hull hit him 
[02:26:30]  in the head.  He would be right up there as far as winning this contest.  And they fucked him up.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  If he's out there, maybe he could call the show today.  Is he still coherent?  I mean, can he still talk?  Yeah, he's pretty fucked up.  He's pretty fucked up, man.  He has a steel plate in his head.  And all he wants to do is get laid, because it happened when he was, like, 17.  What happened?  Oh, not for you.  That was for Gavin.  Why?  There's a whale in this dumb river in England.  Oh, this is England.  It is dumb river.  Beautiful country.  It's an actual sea. 
[02:27:00]  Sorry about that.  All right.  Not for you.  Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland.  No, it's not.  All right.  Let's go to Rich in Virginia.  Rich?  Yeah.  What's up, Rich?  Hey, I just want to know if you and Patrice were going to get to the top ten rap song  right down today.  Oh, you know what?  But Patrice is going to be in next week.  We'll do the top ten rap songs like we did the country songs.  We'll do that next week.  Try to figure out what they mean.  I like them.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do that next week, because we've got to play Operation with Twitchells for some  money.  And also, I want to take a peek at...  He's in Thames? 
[02:27:30]  Huh?  The two whales are in the London Thames.  Look at...  Let's see how you try to play.  I point.  I try to be quiet about it, right?  I point, and he's like...  Now it's the most important story to him.  Yeah.  It's a fucking...  Oh, yeah.  It's a whale in Thames.  And it's trying to get him out.  He's always trying to...  I go...  Everything in England, I point, and I just go, hey, God, there's something going on at  home, and he tries to go, oh, Mike, what do you fucking think I can't...  You think I can't about my homeland, Mike?  And then it's like, after them fucking...  After you make me look like an ass, he's just sitting there going, oh, oh, fucking pushing 
[02:28:00]  a whale.  Look at the tail.  Who is this ridiculous guy that's, like, splashing at the whale?  I don't know.  It's a green face.  Well, the whale isn't in a position to do anything there.  Real close with me.  Let's go to Bill in Vegas.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, I was just thinking a good tip for the messes that come in next week.  You know, be prepared to trump your mess.  You know, be able to take it one step further.  Like the guy who brought in the dead monkey.  You know, it wasn't enough that he brought in the dead monkey, so he stuck his dick in  the monkey's mouth. 
[02:28:30]  That's right.  Anything goes with this.  Wow.  I mean, and use your brain.  You know, I think people are thinking just one way, well, I've got to be missing a body  part or something.  Absolutely not.  You might have some crazy, weird talent.  Trump your mess.  Trump your mess.  I like it, Bill.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Before we play Operation, I want to take a peek at this new show.  I'm into big time.  Yeah.  Beauty and the Geek.  Anyone watching this?  Haven't seen it.  Holy crap.  You get these tens, these women, and you get these just uber geeks that have barely kissed 
[02:29:00]  women.  And one guy holds the record for, like, solving the Rubik's Cube the fastest.  Hey, well, there's a prize.  He does it in 12 seconds.  He can do it behind his back, blindfolded, all this crap.  And these guys are all, like, rocket scientists.  How does he do it blindfolded?  Well, there's a pattern to that.  Yeah, but how do you know when you're...  You just got to know when to stop.  Oh, Christ.  So he looks at it, and he knows how many times he has to do the pattern, and then that's  all it comes down to.  So it's studying the Rubik's Cube and knowing, all right, I can do the pattern for, you know, 
[02:29:30]  10 turns here, and it's going to work.  And then he does it behind his back.  How fast?  Pretty fast?  Well, the world record that he holds, it's like 12 seconds or something.  He solves the Rubik's Cube.  I was never able to solve one of those.  I can't do two sides.  I can't do two sides.  I can't do two sides.  Yeah, you get, like, all right, I got two sides.  Right.  Stupid thing.  That's amazing.  And then you got, like, a guy who's a Dungeon and Dragons guy.  He's a Dungeon Master, and another guy that's studying, like... 
[02:30:00]  Well, he's the Master?  Well...  He's a Dungeon Master.  And all these guys are from, like, MIT, and they're just ridiculously smart.  Yeah.  But their social skills stink, and that's why you got the hot women.  So they learn pop culture and how to dress and stuff from the women, and how to be  more of a man, and then these guys try to give these dumb bimbos some intelligence.  It's a great show.  They live in a mansion, and then they do these things.  Of course.  At the end of the show, they, you know, they couple up, first of all. 
[02:30:30]  I guess I should explain the concept a little better.  The geeks, one by one, go outside to the pool, and all these girls are just lounging around  in tiny, tiny little bathing suits, and the geeks have to introduce themselves, and then  the girls decide, after the geek leaves, who wants to be paired up with that geek.  And is there, like, the last person picked geek?  Well, they avoid that because it's one at a time, so you never...  You don't...  I guess technically you would know, but you don't get to see all of them at once. 
[02:31:00]  They should do that line of it.  Just really degrade them.  There's one guy, maybe we can get the clip, if Danny's listening, of this guy that looks  like Woody Allen, that has anxiety attacks when he sees women.  Absolutely loses his fucking mind, and goes outside, he sees these tans in bathing suits,  and he can't even talk.  Hot chicks in bathing suits.  Because he's just a geek.  That's all he knows in his life.  He doesn't get a chance to even socialize with a girl above a two.  Very nervous.  Yeah.  That's your boy.  Detractive girls.  That's the dude from Family Guy, right? 
[02:31:30]  Was that Family Guy?  Oh, he looks a lot like that.  He's on here now, yeah.  Yeah.  And then there was another guy that has kind of a Napoleon Dynamite feel to him.  So then the girls decide, well, I want that geek, I want that geek, and then they get  a room in this mansion.  What?  And now they get to live together in this room as they're doing these challenges and  tasks and stuff.  Wait, do they sleep in the same room?  They sleep in the same room.  Not the same bed.  Some have only one bed, but the girls are already skeeved out, so they're putting up partitions 
[02:32:00]  and stuff.  But the Woody Allen anxiety guy that actually takes medication because he freaks out when  he sees hot chicks, he was in a room with one of these girls.  He goes, I cannot sleep in the same room with someone as beautiful as this girl.  So he took his stuff and he slept in the closet.  That's probably a good place for him.  No, he's not gay at all.  Not gay.  The guy just cannot handle being in front of beautiful women.  He doesn't know how to act.  What did the girl do?  Was she laughing about it?  Was she cool about it?  Yeah, most of the women are cool, but you can tell they're like, oh, God, I've got to 
[02:32:30]  make believe I care about this geek for five or six weeks.  Well, why not just take the situation you're in and be weird rape guy?  Just like go from the geek, because you're weird anyway.  The girls are looking at you like you're fucking, you're weird.  Right.  Be weird rape guy, where now you're just grabbing women and shoving your dick in them.  There you go.  That's a whole new show there.  I showed you.  And then some of these geeks are delusional because they didn't, you know, the girls want 
[02:33:00]  to hang out at the hot tub with their tiny little bathing suits and stuff in between  challenges and tasks.  And this one guy did not want to hang out at the hot tub because he thinks he has a great  body because he works out.  And they show him like flexing in front of him.  Oh, no.  And he's far from having any type of body, but he's so delusional.  He's like, look, if I got, you know, if I took my shirt off from the girls, you know,  they're going to, the other guys are going to want me kicked out of the house because  I'm obviously better looking than the rest of them.  It's a great, it's a great show.  I'm enjoying this shit out. 
[02:33:30]  It's called Beauty and the Geeks on Thursday nights on the WB, I guess.  So we got some quick clips here just to go over of Beauty and the Geek.  All right.  The ladies get their tasks.  Listen to this.  Ladies, you, however, are going to make a speech.  You may be comfortable using your looks to win people over, but can you use your knowledge  of current issues like the environment and politics and the economy?  We're going to find out. 
[02:34:00]  I'm a senior in college right now and I'm in an international marketing class.  Marketing might have something to do with politics, maybe not, I don't know.  I don't really like politics.  I don't like knowing what people's views are because really, I don't really care.  Whatever works for me, I guess, is best.  And these girls are like, you know, models.  And one girl, all she is is a cocktail slash shot girl.  That's her profession.  Oh, shot girl.  Okay.  So they're just as dumb as dumb can be. 
[02:34:30]  So they have these tasks.  This one, obviously, is to show their intelligence, which they don't have.  And then they had the guys do like singing karaoke, something that they are just not comfortable  with.  Yeah, they're very introverted.  Because they just don't go out.  Yeah.  So the task here was to discuss these hot topics in front of an audience, too.  So now the next clip is one of the girls discussing the ozone layer.  That was her topic, discuss the ozone layer.  Oh, boy.  And then the audience decides which bimbo did the best job.  They win.  And then they don't get kicked out of the house. 
[02:35:00]  Her and her geek don't get kicked out of the house.  All right.  Here we go.  The ozone layer.  Yeah, so ozone layer is key because that's what keeps the sun rays out.  If the sun rays get in, they call it the greenhouse effect.  Have you heard that before?  It keeps the sun rays out, but if the sun still gets to us, but it keeps the harmful things out.  Yeah.  Then it's like a protective layer in the air.  Or else we'd melt.  See, here's RL melt.  We'd melt.  God bless you.  God bless you.  See, I forgot.  This is them practicing because obviously the geeks have all the knowledge. 
[02:35:30]  And they're like, yeah, they're practicing with their women.  And this is what you need to say.  You need to understand this is what the ozone layer is about.  But they can't grasp anything or you'll melt.  Here's one geek helping his beauty about Social Security because this might be one of the topics.  Okay, Social Security.  We just talked about this in class the other day.  Social Security, isn't that what you get when you're older?  For some reason, I don't know why, but they're afraid it's going to run out.  Like, because, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
[02:36:00]  I think my partner is probably not going to do very well with her speech.  No, I know something.  Normally, at first, I was like, what is that?  I thought maybe she had a few blonde moments, but apparently her life is just one long blonde moment.  And the geeks get so fucking frustrated because these girls are so stupid.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I know.  It's when you get old.  Right.  Yeah, great.  And the hot pieces of asses get frustrated because these guys are just messing.  Yeah.  But that's the hilarious thing, that their vaginas equal these motherfuckers' brains. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's equal power.  Right.  But it's like the same end of the magnet.  When you try to put them together, the North and the North, they just push apart of equal strength.  But there's no connection there.  Does pussy really Trump genius?  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'm sorry, mate.  Yeah.  I mean, they can be so thick sometimes, it's great.  A good piece of ass will get anything she wants. 
[02:37:00]  As good as.  Yeah.  And then a genius guy.  If you get a smart bit of ass, it's really nice.  What are you going to get?  What's the guy going to get, though, for being a genius?  So that was them practicing, and now it's time for the debate.  Now they've got to see which girl is the best at soaking in this knowledge and screwing it out to an audience.  So the first girl here is discussing taxes in front of a live audience.  We're the only country that didn't sign this thing called the Kyoto Protocol. 
[02:37:30]  Like the Kyoto Dragon.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my gosh.  She didn't say like the Kyoto Dragon.  Yeah, well, yeah, this is one more clip of them practicing.  I'm sorry.  Listen to this.  We're the only country that didn't sign this thing called the Kyoto Protocol.  Like the Kyoto Dragon.  Cheryl seems very stubborn to take my advice when it comes to studying.  I think I'm going to take a power nap.  You're going to take a power nap?  You're going to take a power nap?  Yeah, this reading is making me tired. 
[02:38:00]  But it's been like five minutes.  Five minutes.  That five minutes was more than she's ever had as far as her brain working.  She was not.  And she needed a nap.  That's what Bill Gates says.  Yeah.  I've got to take a power nap.  But he's inventing the world and shit.  Yeah.  I'll be right back.  The concept for the show is just brilliant.  The Kyoto Dragon.  Because these guys are taking it so seriously because, you know, their intelligence is on the line, you know?  Yeah.  What did I win?  I mean, what does a geek get there? 
[02:38:30]  $250,000, the last couple in the house.  Okay, gotcha.  So, finally, here's the girls debating after they had their geeks prep them.  The first girl discusses taxes.  Your question is, do you support lower or higher taxes, and why?  Actually, I believe, my view would be for the democratic view in this situation.  I feel that people who are more wealthier should definitely have higher taxes. 
[02:39:00]  Let me collect my thoughts and stuff.  A little change purse.  I know I'm trying to look smart right now in my suit, but it's kind of hard.  The whole problem with Danielle's speech thing was that we did a lot of practicing for the karaoke competition.  Maybe a little too much.  I felt really good about coming here in this, like, really cute outfit with my pink shoes and my pink pop,  but it's really not giving me much brain power.  I feel that, that my suit is cute and that I'm wearing hoops like J-Lo. 
[02:39:30]  She could not have taxes at all.  She had nothing.  She had no opinion on taxes.  About to decide grand on shoes and handbags.  Except what she heard.  Well, that's the best part.  Tax the rich.  That's the best part, too, because they dress him up to make him look more intelligent, too.  When all they want to do is wear the tiny...  Oh, what do they put him in those Hillary Clinton suits?  Pretty much, pretty much.  Now, do you think women, there's a woman out there, a beautiful woman, who gets anxiety attacks when she's around, like, smart people? 
[02:40:00]  There's geeks!  She sounded like she was getting one, but they have to be proven to be like that.  Like, you have to...  Like, there's never a point in time where, just in regular society, where you go, you know, you're beautiful, but you are a fucking idiot.  And she's just like, oh, my God.  It's just like, it takes this kind of thing, brother.  If she's at a cocktail party with intelligent people, not one of them is going to walk up to her and go, how do you feel about taxes?  That's why she's not getting an anxiety attack in front of, like, wealthy, educated people that are in a room, because they never would approach her with something like that. 
[02:40:30]  Right, right, right.  But they put her in the situation on the show, and she loses her mind.  Right.  All right.  And now...  Collect her thoughts in a thimble.  Now, here's the first girl that picked pollution as the topic.  You have to pick a number, and then the host tells you what you have to talk about.  Pollution, bud.  What are you going to say about it?  Dirt!  Well, they bring it to a whole new life.  Oh, listen to that.  What do you think about pollution?  Dirt!  Okay. 
[02:41:00]  Just keywords.  Like she's giving clues for the $25,000 pyramid.  Dirt, air, smokestacks, things that pollute.  Here we go.  Checkers.  Jennifer, what would you do to prevent pollution?  When I heard the question, I was like, ooh, this is great.  That was the one she took the most notes on.  That was the one she sort of, like, hammered in.  Well, let me start off by saying that there are three types of pollution.  There's air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. 
[02:41:30]  For the speech, I just knew that I wasn't going to remember all the information that I learned.  The way that I can prevent air pollution is maybe not eating a lot of gaseous foods.  We'll be farting a lot.  That's far more air pollution.  I just had to start picking up stuff in my head and just, I don't know, making up stuff.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what I was doing up there.  I was just talking.  Everybody, just do your part.  Reuse, reduce, recycle, whatever the slogan is or whatever. 
[02:42:00]  Use, reduce, recycle.  Is that an airhead niggly?  Yeah.  Sounded like that.  Is that an airhead black girl?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  See?  Wow.  Fuck.  This equal opportunity shit is supposed to be dumb blonde, not a dumb black girl.  So here we go.  Farting is really the problem we got with the air pollution.  Eating gaseous foods.  Then here's the second girl that came up and also picked pollution to talk about.  Oh, okay.  Tristan, your question is, what would you do to prevent pollution? 
[02:42:30]  Ah, crap.  I can't tell these exact numbers.  If we keep acting and doing things the way we're doing them, it's going to be bad.  Turn off your refrigerators tomorrow and let's revert back to the olden days.  Let us go out into the woods and start picking berries.  As soon as I knew I kind of had the audience with laughing, there was no turning back.  It's just like, all right, I'm going to go with this.  What a reason our ice caps are melting.  The audience seemed to love it.  The audience was laughing. 
[02:43:00]  I didn't know what they were judging on.  I had no idea.  Your stupidity.  Ice.  Your stupidity.  You're the reason ice is melting.  You know what?  The ice melting is always fucking up.  It's always been a pollutant.  Yeah.  Melting ice is always a pollutant.  They show the geeks in the audience and they're just dumbfounded.  They get so pissed off.  When you pee in the toilet, really think about it.  Where does it go?  It's water pollution in your toilet because it was clear water and then when I stand up, 
[02:43:30]  it's yellow and that's polluted.  When you take a shower.  Now, I took a shower yesterday.  How did I get dirt on me again?  See, that's pollution.  All right.  Next girl.  We're almost done here.  I had to talk about global warming.  Uh-oh.  What would you do to alleviate global warming?  Just because I have immunity doesn't mean that I'm safe.  I still need to put 101% out there.  Okay. 
[02:44:00]  Global warming.  Do you know what?  Our earth is a delicate earth.  I think everybody here is connected.  You know?  Everybody is related somehow.  So your children are my children.  I'm finished.  Holy shit.  I'm telling you, these birds are so stupid.  No, no.  That was by far the dumbest answer out of all of them so far.  Global warming.  We're all connected.  Your children are my children. 
[02:44:30]  That's what she said.  My children are warm.  Why?  And the beauty of this show, you know, these girls, you know, obviously it's not smart to  play dumb because they want to win the money in the end.  They already got on the show for being dumb, so now they're trying to show how smart they  actually are.  So they really wanted to sound smart.  Yeah, they really wanted to sound smart so they win this task or challenge so they don't  get kicked out of the house.  Because they want to win the money eventually.  She didn't even try. 
[02:45:00]  So who picks them off the show after that?  I mean, the audience, is it?  Or the...  Yeah, now the audience has to decide which girl did the best.  Finally, the last girl talked about pollution as well.  What would you do to prevent pollution?  Everything is recycled.  My shoes that I'm wearing right now are actually made out of recycled cow skin.  Sarah has a lot of strong points.  She's very good at being cute.  When you have kids, you're constantly changing diapers. 
[02:45:30]  Don't throw them in the backyard because that's land pollution.  You know, people aren't going to take her seriously because she is attractive, so I was a little  concerned.  If everyone could just take a small step into pollution, it would make our world a much better  world.  A small step into pollution.  Into pollution.  Let's step into some pollution here.  So that was the girl challenge.  Unbelievable.  Your womb is so polluted, you can't even have a little baby. 
[02:46:00]  So just how the show works, so then one girl won, so then her and her geek are safe, and  they get to pick a couple that is on the chopping block for the final challenge, okay?  And then there's a guy challenge, and the guy challenge was singing karaoke, you know,  a social type thing.  Yeah.  And then the guy that did the best karaoke, he was safe, and him and his beauty will not  get voted out of the house, but they get to pick another couple to go to the ultimate 
[02:46:30]  challenge again, which is like trivia, okay?  Uh-huh.  And last night's show, we're just focusing on the women because they were the dummies  this week, certainly.  The women had to talk about, had questions on politics, and the guys had questions about  popular music, okay?  Okay.  So we just got some highlights, all right?  And I'm watching this with Lindsay, and man, you know, she's one of these girls, love her,  but she asked me questions, there's no good answer.  There's no good answer, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this. 
[02:47:00]  We're watching, you know, the beauty and the geek at the end, the two couples going at  it, and it's the two beauties doing questions about politics, and she casually goes, so who  do you want to win?  You know, we invested an hour in this show, so I guess that would be a normal question,  right?  So she asked me, who do you want to win?  So I pick the one girl, she goes, why is that?  You can't win that woman.  And you can't win, right?  And if you don't answer, then the thing is, well, why won't you answer the question? 
[02:47:30]  And what do you like about her?  You don't like about me.  Right.  Where's that my girl from?  So I got killed last night, because I obviously picked the hottest girl, that's the only reason.  I don't know her from a hole in the wall, I'm just watching this dumb show, so if it comes  down to it, you're obviously going to pick the one that's hotter.  Of course you are.  Is my ass fat while we watch this show?  Yeah.  You don't fancy me, you like her, we're watching a show, we can never.  What?  Proving that my chick is very, very smart.  Let me ask you this, do the girls on the show? 
[02:48:00]  So I answer, and then I get killed, I'm like, daaaah.  No, I do.  Is she the hottest one as well?  No, the one that you picked.  She was one of the hotter ones.  Do the girls on the show, do they argue with each other as well?  Do they hate each other?  Do they slug each other off?  No, they're supportive of each other.  Oh, they're all gilded arms?  Yeah, but it's probably all bullshit.  It's even worse.  So I got myself into a position last night, because I answered one of those impossible  questions, there's no right answer.  You can only wish that she gets voted off the show, then you'd be safe.  There's no right answer.  We'll have to do a whole show on our women asking the questions that there's no answer 
[02:48:30]  to.  Yeah.  That's when you need the ejector seat on your couch.  You pull the handle between your legs, the segment of your roof comes off, and the chair  goes, pfft.  The parachute lands you safely miles from your home.  That's where I wish I could get explosive diarrhea on, where I could just call on explosive  diarrhea.  I'd love to answer that, but I'd have to hit the bathroom.  You wish you could unlock a big eye and just have someone to answer. 
[02:49:00]  And I wasn't even thinking.  I'm like, oh, that's a good question.  We've been watching the show for an hour, so I go her, Amanda, I think it was.  Why?  Ah, why?  Well, because I think she's smarter.  All right, anyway, so finally, it's the two women talking about politics.  We've got a couple highlights here.  Listen to these answers.  What is the address of the White House?  I just told Amanda this answer.  I just told Amanda this.  What?  I just told you. 
[02:49:30]  1,600 Pennsylvania?  1,600 Pennsylvania.  1, White House Road, Washington, D.C., United States of America.  That's a good choice.  I'm sorry, that is incorrect.  1, White House Road.  1, White House Road makes perfect sense.  Where's Osama Banalip?  Um, 36, blow your ass up Boulevard.  Next to the big man to the left on the summer?  Oh, my God.  And you hear the guys yelling, they're in a soundproof room, yelling the answers, you know. 
[02:50:00]  Really?  Hoping that the...  1, White House Road.  And remember, they want to be smart, because they want to stay in the house and win the money.  So this is them trying.  You know, it isn't...  Where's John White live?  Gun Street?  Huh?  What, bitch?  You know, it isn't 1, White House Road, but it should be.  It should be.  That's right.  Why isn't it?  Stuff that should be.  Why is it fucking 1,600 Pennsylvania Avenue?  Where are whales from?  Atlantor?  What? 
[02:50:30]  From whale land.  Whale.  Whales.  Whale.  From whales.  Whale, whales.  That's right.  Let's go to Chad in Buffalo.  Chad?  No, guys.  I was watching that show last night, too, and my girl asked the same question.  As soon as I said to go, I wanted to win, I was like, shit.  She sat up, gave me that look, and I'm like, yep.  And you wanted Amanda, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because it wasn't even close as far as the hotness factor.  Yeah, well, I didn't like the other guys, but, you know, that girl was hotter, so I was like, yeah, I'll go with Amanda. 
[02:51:00]  And she's just like, what?  And I was like, shit.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Yeah, sometimes you get blindsided.  You're not even thinking.  You're like, yeah, I'll answer this question.  It's no big deal.  It is a big deal.  Fuck.  The only thing you can do is pick the girl nearest to what your girl looks like, just to remotely get out of it.  You know, she's got blonde hair like you, baby.  Matt in Boston.  I can't believe you guys didn't figure this out.  The right answer is, honey, I don't care who wins.  I like watching these stupid cunts get eliminated. 
[02:51:30]  It doesn't matter to me.  I'm not rooting for anybody.  That's right.  I just think it's fun to see how stupid they are.  All right.  Here's the next question.  What American historical figure has his face on a $10 bill?  Thomas Jefferson.  Holy cow.  That is incorrect.  That's not the easiest question in the world, though.  That's not one of those.  Alexander Hamilton.  But that's one of those.  That's an obscure one.  It's not like Lincoln or Washington.  I think half of us would have got that wrong in this room. 
[02:52:00]  I should have stopped the tape.  I'm going to tell you something.  Well, you.  Come on.  Every bill's got that fucking queen on it.  That's what I'm saying.  It's easy to do, buddy.  Okay, who else is on the pound note?  The guy who invented the trolley?  This is why I hate these stupid countries.  We have a theme.  Dead president and the White House on the back.  Their theme is the queen and some obscure assholes. 
[02:52:30]  We've got the queen on the front and on the back is a lorry.  Dude, we have famous inventors and things like that.  Famous inventors.  The queen and Sir Jonathan Schooglmery who invented the tube.  He invented drinking back in 19th.  Winston Churchill.  He should be on there, actually.  He's not on there, I don't think.  He should be on there.  Yeah, let's go to Paul in New Jersey.  Paul. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, oh, but you're so pussywhip that you can't even tell your girl that you think the chick  on TV's hot?  Thank you, sir.  No, I'm not.  Thank you, sir.  Absolutely, I'm not going down that road.  It's just I like this guy, man.  Don't fuck that to the guy.  That's what I've been trying to say.  I'm not going down that fucking road.  I say off the air, on the air, stop this shit.  No, I can't.  Who would you vote for?  Well, I would vote for that girl.  Why?  Well, because I would love to fuck her.  Tracy's a swinger, it's okay.  You can do that.  I would love to fuck her.  Don't you want to fuck her too, sweetie?  That's why you get with a bisexual. 
[02:53:30]  Let's call her over right now.  That is a fantasy world that most guys don't get to live in.  Curious.  Know why, Paul?  Because I don't want to know who she thinks is hot.  See, that's our problem.  I don't want to fucking know.  Man, we got to get over our shit, Opie.  It doesn't matter who she can get him.  I don't want to know.  It's a mind thing.  Just say, hey, because I want to fuck her.  Well, what if I wanted to fuck the geek? 
[02:54:00]  Knock yourself out.  I hope he has a big dick.  I hope he fucks your bladder loose, baby.  Go get him, tiger.  Women don't, when we don't care, they don't function well.  Just don't care.  Let her fuck a geek.  Tell her I want to fuck this hot chick.  Well, I want to fuck the guy who plays Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo movies.  Well, well, well.  Make him wear this fucking Shaggy fucking wig and fuck the shit out of him, punk it.  Call me crazy for not wanting to play that game.  I just don't want to play that fucking game. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you, Paul.  Fuck that.  These fucking guys, man.  Fuck that.  All right, here we go.  Here's the last question from last night's Beauty and the Geek.  What is the capital of Iraq?  Not going to get that one.  Could you spell Iraq was?  What?  There you go.  Get it.  Take some time there.  I-R-A-Q.  You shouldn't say Iraq town.  You want to go with Afghanistan?  Oh, my God.  That is incorrect.  That. 
[02:55:00]  There should be a test.  There should be a test that allows you to be an American citizen.  And I don't mean the one they give you.  Who are we at war with?  Because it doesn't matter.  They study for that shit.  It's like, yeah.  Can you spell, can you say that in a sentence, please?  Yeah.  We're at war.  I-R-A-C-K-E with a hyphen over it.  What?  Well, guys are always looking at my rack. 
[02:55:30]  And that kind of rhymes with Iraq.  So I got to say nipple.  You stump grunt.  Spell black.  B-L-A-Q.  What?  Close enough, you piece of ass.  All right.  John in Michigan.  What's up, John?  Hey, my wife asked me, oh, fuck.  I suck.  Hi, Mom.  I'm punched out, too.  All right.  He punched out. 
[02:56:00]  His plane is in flames, but he is slowly coming down to earth.  He didn't crash.  His wife asked him the unanswerable question.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's the point I was bringing up.  No matter what relationship you're in, there's those questions they're asked.  There's no right answer.  That's all I'm saying.  The unanswerable question.  I fucking just...  Never mind.  Not for Patrice.  Never mind.  Patrice, let me tell you something.  People want to think that I'm fucking some bullshit, motherfucker.  No.  This is a credit to you, my friend.  You are a rare breed.  I've got to say. 
[02:56:30]  You are a rare breed of guy that is like the way you treat women, the fact that they don't  run for a court to get a restraining order or some shit, it astounds me that they don't  spend a day with you and just go, fall, fall, this shit.  Like they just stay.  So you've got some kind of magic and philosophy that works.  It works for you and the women you're with, and it's amazing to me. 
[02:57:00]  But Opie has to understand when they ask that question.  It's not just Opie.  You put Opie.  I'm just saying Opie just for purposes, but it's...  I'm not alone in this one.  I know that.  Okay.  The Opie's of the world.  I don't know.  But see, guys don't ask the unanswerable questions to their women.  They get...  Wait.  That's the point.  Wait, Opie.  That's the fucking point.  It's a female thing.  They ask us the unanswerable questions.  But they...  That's the thing.  We enable it because they ask and they know that they fucking do it.  Beatrice answers. 
[02:57:30]  That's what...  So if she goes, she's asked, she's asked, she...  Okay.  Always think, even no matter what tone she has, always put this tone in your head.  So, who would you vote for?  Even if she goes, so honey, booby scooby, honey squirts, who do you vote for?  Always in your head go, who, well, who the fuck you like?  Which bitch you want to fuck?  That one right there, hoe.  I like those fucking, I fucking shit out that girl right there. 
[02:58:00]  Any other questions?  Just ask.  All right.  Yeah, sit back and shut up.  Holy shit.  Opie, you understand?  That's the trick.  There's more Opie's than Opie's in this world.  There are more Opie's.  I like where I'm at right now.  Oliver in St. Louis.  Wow.  I'm fine with where I'm at.  Oliver.  Hey, man, don't you guys love Beauty and the Geek every day when you go home after work?  All right.  Oh, there's a piece of that.  All right, all right.  Why don't we take a break?  On the way, we got Ted.  Ted, uh...  Alexandro. 
[02:58:30]  That's right.  He's a very funny comedian.  He's going to come in and help us with Twitchell's playing Operation, I guess.  Yeah.  Twitchell's plays Operation next, and we're all going to bet.  And also, we got a food plug on the way, I guess.  Food plug?  Right?  Ooh.  Yeah, we got free food today.  All right.  We never stopped the radio show.  What's up?  We went to break, and Patrice just went off.  It just keeps going. 
[02:59:00]  Frustration, man.  Want to say hi to Ted Alexandro.  He's in studio as well today.  What's up, guys?  Sorry to make you wait, but we're in the middle of a huge fucking thing there.  Yeah, no, please.  Clusterfuck.  Now, what did I miss?  I left the studio, and I came back to a huge laugh.  The conversation was still going on about relationships, and I've been stunned by Patrice's relationship.  I talked to him about it, even at the Halloween party and stuff, and I don't understand it.  I don't get it.  I don't see how it works without it being this dominant motherfucker and this subservient, scared woman. 
[02:59:30]  No.  But he says, no, that isn't it.  But everything he says describes a dominant, subservient relationship.  And I'm not talking shit.  And Gavin sees it's like my girl is not, I'm not fucking some evil motherfucker.  I just, it's like my happiness is paramount.  When you see a happy woman, that means there's a miserable guy.  When you see a happy fucking guy, it's a happy woman, because we have to keep them happy. 
[03:00:00]  And I'm like, this is not my job to fucking keep you happy.  Oh, why don't you treat me like a queen?  Yeah, I will.  The king's bitch.  That's who the queen is.  That says it all.  Treat me like a queen.  Okay.  You're the king's bitch.  That's what a queen is, the king's bitch.  And she's not no scared.  It's just, she tests me and tests me.  And so who do you, ready? 
[03:00:30]  Sweetie pie, who do you want to win?  Always in my head.  Who, so what bitch you want to, here's how I reverse it.  Ready?  Who do you want to win?  Ready, sweetie?  Who do you think I want to win?  Ooh.  Then she points to the bitch that she knows I will fuck.  Now next time.  Yo, that's what a young woman.  She knows the women I like.  I like big fat bitches, right?  So, my girl doesn't get threatened by fucking other beautiful women like her.  She gets threatened by big, ugly, fat bitches. 
[03:01:00]  Wow.  He does as well.  He does.  He looks around the school.  And she'll point that who, the one with the soggy ass titties.  And you knew at home before you asked the question.  You are in bizarro world relationships.  You are in a bizarro world relationship.  Drew boogie knows, baby.  That's why I was in Jersey.  Yeah, Drew's talking all kinds of shit the same way Patrice is.  The whole commercial break.  In your relationship, is there any equal ground at all? 
[03:01:30]  Or do you have the upper hand in every single thing?  Not in, it seems like the only thing that she has over me.  There's no equality in your relationship.  She can leave and get any guy she wants to fuck her.  Yeah.  If she wants to, and that's the only thing I have to detach myself from.  We've seen her.  Now, if there's a problem, and she goes out that night with the determination that,  Fuck this guy, I'm going to go fucking, she will get fucked that night.  She is, she is.  It's not like some pig that's going to go out to a bar and five in the morning have to 
[03:02:00]  pack it up because she can't get fucked.  That's where she wins, but other than that, there is not a, and it's not because I'm trying  to, it's that I'm smarter than her, I'm quicker than her, it's just, it just is what  it is, dude, it is what it is, she was crying the other day because she felt inadequate,  but I'm like, don't cry, sweetie, it's not.  Why do you think she feels inadequate?  Look, first of all, she's not.  No, no, no, no, no, no, why do you think she feels inadequate?  Maybe because he goes on radio saying that he's smarter and quicker.  Right, because, perhaps because a man named Patrice O'Neal. 
[03:02:30]  My king, you bitch.  I'm the king, bitch.  You all fucking don't even know.  I don't.  The only one who understands that it's not evil is Drew.  You've got to stop, man.  He's a brother.  What a coincidence.  I think it's the mentality of a brother.  Fuck.  I think it's the mentality of a brother.  The American brother, it's different.  Yeah.  The English guys are completely different.  Because we want happiness.  I take care of this.  Look, man.  What you said earlier, during the break, he said, and in this sick way, it makes sense, 
[03:03:00]  but it's so twisted.  Absolutely.  He said that he, the good part of this whole thing is that he chooses to be with her.  He chooses to love her.  Yeah.  He's not obligated to it.  Yes.  And the second he starts taking shit from her, that means that he is obligated to love her  and be with her.  Yes.  That means he lost the power.  That means, I volunteer my love to my girl. 
[03:03:30]  And if she takes that shit for granted, then I take my free love away.  And I freely give her.  You are the black Dr. Phil.  Dude, man.  You really are, man.  There's nothing that says we owe a thing.  I don't owe her nothing.  Her job, because I keep her more happy than she keeps me.  All she has to do is fuck me and shut her face and stay pretty.  I don't need nothing else. 
[03:04:00]  I gotta be, I gotta guide the bitch.  I gotta give her money.  I gotta give her, I'm that dude for her.  I'm what she needs.  I'm what she wants.  You're gonna be back to the whores in Rio before you know it.  Why do you have to put the word voluntarily at the end of I love you?  You know, like, isn't that understood?  Like, I love you.  No, it's not understood, Ted.  Voluntarily, baby.  No, man.  No, because a lot of guys, they chase after the women, and they're, it's, oh, Jesus. 
[03:04:30]  It's slow.  I'm gonna get out of the words in a minute.  I know what you're saying.  See, now, Ted, I don't want, I'm, this is not personal business, but Ted has a lot of sisters.  And, like, five sisters or something like that?  No, I only have two.  But he has, she's grew up with sisters, and you love them?  Yeah, I love them.  Love them.  I have two sisters.  It's like, I don't have, I love them, I love them.  I love them, I love them.  Voluntarily, I love them.  I've got a lot of sisters, but it's like.  Am I there?  Yes.  That's what you gotta understand.  Love is not something that you're, that anyone's owed to, man. 
[03:05:00]  There's people out there that don't love their mama.  You are.  You're not supposed to be pressured to love anybody.  Yes.  Honey Glover color purple mother fucker.  No, man, no.  It's like, you should, your love is a free thing, man.  It's not a, it's not something that you, you're supposed to fucking do.  Yeah.  Someone earns your love, man.  I, if my mother loves me, I earn her love.  It's not, it's not an obligatory thing.  It's like, you go, damn, I want to love you.  I want to love my girl, but she got to keep me in that mode.  Do you know something, though, that there is a part of love, and some people see love 
[03:05:30]  as, you know, loving relationship as some, some form of sacrifices because you care so much  about somebody that you're willing to give up a convenience or an emotion or something  because it would make her feel happier, and you, your love is so much for that person.  Here's the point.  Okay.  Our, the way we treat our women, we have to constantly, because they are a different animal. 
[03:06:00]  Now, when I say, fuck me, be quiet, what I meant by that is, that's what, that's all  I fucking need.  Don't bug me when I don't want to be bugged.  You have a, your list, your list of things that you don't, that it's, it's fucking so  easy for your girl not to get on your nerves.  So easy.  And you might have four things where you go, if I had a chick like this, I'll be happy.  Women, not only do you have to make them happy and keep them happy, you have to be fucking 
[03:06:30]  creative.  You never had your girl go, well, let's do something tonight, let's go somewhere, we  never go nowhere.  Where do you want to go, sweetie?  I don't, I don't know.  It's up to you.  I just, I just, I don't know.  No, we have to, we have to be the ones that constantly help nurture them and love them  or, and, and, and keep them happy.  Sealy, Sealy, come here, Sealy.  You don't understand me.  And I'm not like that, dude.  I've never hit a woman in my fucking life.  I've never even. 
[03:07:00]  Not physically.  I'm not even, it sounds like there's a mental battering going on.  Well, sometimes, you know why?  It's the, okay, how men chase pussy, that's how women chase our manhood, relentlessly.  It's a, it's, it's not even a, a focus.  It's a nature.  They don't want a pussy ass man.  It's, it, it, it, it takes you down anytime you enable them when it's not natural.  Like that whole question, who would you fuck?  You, okay, I can go, for example, I'm going to bed one time, my ex-girl, this is my ex-girl, 
[03:07:30]  and she goes, what side of the bed do you want to lay on?  Okay, this is the shit that, here's where it ends for men.  When that, when we get, you ever get that gut feeling of this fucking bitch, but you don't  say nothing, okay?  Where it ends is where you don't say nothing.  So, she goes, what side of the bed do you want to lay on?  And I go, this side.  And then she goes, but then I won't be able to see the TV.  And so I go, well, bitch, why the fuck did you ask me where do you want to sleep anyway?  Now, I could have went, okay, I'll just sleep on the other side. 
[03:08:00]  But that was some enabling shit that she wanted, women are not humble enough to go, can you,  they want us to be chivalrous, but they want to force it to happen, but they don't want  to, like, humble.  So, instead of saying, I like this side of the bed, you know, even I like this side  of the bed, is that okay with you, or whatever, to be nice about it, it was, what side do  you want?  So, that way, when you say the side she wants, she could then turn it around. 
[03:08:30]  It's manipulation.  Do you ever get a full night's sleep, or do you guys just go back and forth talking  about who's going to get it to?  Because it ends like that.  I just see it as so strange.  And do you know where the happiness starts to happen?  Where?  Where?  The happiness starts to happen is when she starts to think, okay, is this righteous, what  I'm getting ready to do?  So, am I asking my man a righteous question when I ask him who will he vote for?  So, she says, hold up, all right, this is some bullshit-ass manipulating girl shit I'm 
[03:09:00]  about to ask.  You know what?  I'm not going to ask it, because this asshole is going to make me suffer for asking bullshit.  That's fear and walking on eggshells.  Good.  Fuck it.  If you want to call it that, I'm fine.  Good, bitch.  And you know what?  I bought you some soft boots so those eggshells don't fucking hurt so much.  Fuck you.  All right, listen.  You're going to be in next week.  We're going to have to talk about this more.  Wow.  Because you're going to hit on something.  The phones have exploded.  I love it.  Well, we have Twitchels outside the studio.  We've got to end with this game of operations. 
[03:09:30]  I am fascinated by your relationship.  And it isn't even something that I don't understand.  Like, I understand what you're saying.  I understand the words.  I understand everything.  I cannot see it working.  It's like some kind of a fucking Einstein theory that can't be proven in real life.  I don't...  And I don't just...  I don't victimize...  I'm not a predator when it comes to, oh, I'm going to find some weak woman.  My girl's not a weak girl.  I've been out with doctors, lawyers, fucking journalists or whatever the fuck. 
[03:10:00]  And they're all goofy.  They're geniuses.  But they're goofy because they're girls.  And there's certain things we do that this...  Because they're girls, they're going to do.  And there's certain things that we do because we're men.  It is what it is.  I'm telling you.  I love it.  We're running out of show here.  All right.  Got to say hi to Ted Alexandro.  What's up, guys?  You performing anywhere?  I'm sorry, Ted.  I know you're...  No, actually, Patrice hit on a lot of the things I was going to say.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Do you have a moment?  It's a crazy day to come in.  Are we promoting anything today?  Yeah, I'm at Gotham this weekend.  Yeah, the new location, 208, West 23rd, Friday and Saturday night.  Ted is a very funny guy.  I've seen him many times.  He'll make me laugh.  Thanks, Rob.  And also, Ted is the...  Should we say?  Yeah.  He's the co-leader of the Comedy Coalition in New York City.  Him and Russell Neve.  Yeah, they put it all in.  He did it twice.  He put it...  Actually, Ted is the fucking man because he put it together twice.  Once by himself.  And then he got smarter the next time and got some other people to go down with him just 
[03:11:00]  in case.  But he's like...  He pushed a lot of stuff.  We're getting more money and a lot of shit in New York.  Yeah, stiff arms, some of these club arms.  Yeah, because of Ted and Russell.  It's amazing how much these guys don't get paid when they're just in town, you know,  doing their thing.  Russ is funny, too, man.  Yeah, Russ is good.  What happened?  He's a good man.  And that's Twitchells.  He has Tourette's and he's...  I met him outside.  Yeah, we were talking outside.  You have a half-hour special coming up on Comedy Central.  Thank you, brother.  Yes, coming out March 10th.  That's awesome. 
[03:11:30]  That's a positive response, I guess?  That's what we all want to say.  That's Twitchell, right?  Translate.  Twitchells approved.  Cool, man.  Cool, cool.  Twitchells approved.  Well, every time he comes in here, we have him do stuff and we've got a game of operation  that's set up and ready to go.  We're going to bet, though.  Who wants in?  I'm in, man.  I'm in.  I'm the book.  I'll take it.  You want to do five or ten dollars a man?  Five.  You want to do a little quick five?  You can always, you know, go up to the next level. 
[03:12:00]  So how are you going to work this?  How many times do you do it?  Well, basically, we've got the operation in front of you.  And all the body parts are in there already?  Yes.  It's all set to go.  So we have to pick out the body part from a hat again.  So the nutty bone is on the thigh bone, is it?  Is that what it was?  Huh?  Oh, it is.  That was the thigh bone.  There you go, yeah.  The shin bone or the thigh bone or something.  Femure.  Don't go practicing.  Yeah, don't practice.  Put that goddamn thing down.  I know, believe it or not, of course I know the game. 
[03:12:30]  I've never played it before in my life.  No, never.  Me and Patrice are in there.  No surprise.  All right, I'm in.  So where's the...  Here we go.  Throw the fives in.  You want to throw me a five back?  I just got a thing.  There you go.  Throw that in there.  Thank you, sir.  All right, so basically, I guess Nathaniel should just hand out cards to everybody.  Okay.  Is this for the body parts?  It's $5 a man.  Yeah.  We're all going to get a body part that Nathaniel just randomly gives us.  Okay.  And then one by one, Twitchell will try to get that part out without making it buzz. 
[03:13:00]  Now, the only way to also make it fair is after we get our body part, we have to remember  it.  I can write it down.  We'll write it down.  Let's hold the card.  Let's have the cards back.  Shuffle them up and then have him choose cards.  Gotcha.  So there's no particular order.  Oh, that's a good idea.  What about if you have the same body parts?  What's that?  Split the parts?  I'm in.  I'm in.  Yeah, we'll split the parts.  Trace is in.  I'm in.  Yep, Trace is in.  Whoa. 
[03:13:30]  That's a threat.  13 parts?  How many people?  Seven.  Seven?  All right.  So we'll just deal with those seven?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, so Nathaniel is...  All right, who's in?  The guy in the corner is completely...  Pass him out.  Skits that.  What's happening?  Pen of diamonds.  Six of clubs, eights of spades.  Hold on.  Ted Yun?  I'm in.  All right, Patricia in.  What are we looking at, Ben?  Hold on.  Gavin's in. 
[03:14:00]  Who else?  I'm missing somebody.  I've got a weird card.  I think it should be secret, too.  This card's not even made.  You want to keep it secret?  So that way when he does it or doesn't do it...  Okay, good.  Okay.  So what are we betting?  We're betting...  In American dollars.  Who...  What part he's going to successfully remove...  And who it corresponds with.  Oh, fuck.  I got a good one.  I got a real good one.  I got a good one.  I might have a good one.  I might have a good one here, Brent.  You got my funny bones. 
[03:14:30]  So what do you guys want me to try to do?  The object is to not touch the sides, right?  That's the object of the game there, Twitchell.  The game is 50 fucking years old.  I've never played it.  The object is to take those tweezers, remove the part without touching the sides.  You also have never built a house of parts.  So you want me to get as many of them out without touching the sides as I can, right?  No, no.  We all have parts that are going to be ours.  So how do we determine which one I go for first? 
[03:15:00]  Anything you want.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Nathaniel, he gets some back now.  Yeah, we're going to hand the cards back.  And he picks one out while running it.  And then he's got...  Oh, okay.  So I'll randomly pick one out.  Randomly pay.  And that's the one I've got to go for.  No, wait.  Aren't there enough cards where there's double...  No, there's only 13 cards.  Yeah.  We'll just do seven.  It's all right.  Just do seven.  I'll just put the seven back in again.  All right.  Nathaniel's writing down on everyone's body part.  And if he successfully pulls that body part out, you're in the game. 
[03:15:30]  You're in the game.  If it's not successful, then you're out of the game.  And then after the round, we'll see who's left.  And they'll split the pot, I guess.  He's not going to get one, I don't think.  He's going to get mine.  I don't think he's going to get one.  I don't think he's going to get one.  So what's like the widest one here?  Is it like...  Which one is it?  I lost a bunch of...  It doesn't matter.  When you're shaking, everything becomes just a small little...  Thank you for reminding me.  I'm going to play an operation with an actual giant.  Life-sized. 
[03:16:00]  So walk inside of them and it'll still buzz.  You're trying to get those tweezers in the Grand Canyon.  You're not going to be successful.  Don't touch the signs in the Grand Canyon.  You're just going to bring back.  Fuck.  I can't believe it.  I never played this game before, but I think I can handle it.  I think I can handle it.  What did you do as a child?  How did you not play this game as a child?  Dr. Twitchell.  I've heard of it, of course.  I never played it.  Dr. Twitchell's into the operating room now.  No, no, no. 
[03:16:30]  Dr. Twitchell.  Dr. Twitchell.  Do I see you in the dark, cold blue?  That's actually really funny.  2020 did a special on a brain surgery when I asked Tourette.  Ah, we don't care.  Okay.  He's only trying to break into a heartwarming story about the ranch.  I'm not heartwarming.  It's a single patient, Terry Schiavo.  No, I just thought it was ironic.  All right.  No practicing.  No practicing.  All right.  All right.  And we've got to mic the board. 
[03:17:00]  Do we have another microphone?  We've got to mic that board.  Dr. Twitchell.  That's funny.  Dr. Twitchell.  That is funny, Mike.  All right.  Nathaniel, I guess you...  Dr. Twitchell, please report to the microsurgery ward.  Dr. Twitchell, if you have a LASIK eye surgery, it needs to be completed.  Dr. Twitchell.  Now, as a kid, I remember it was a little tricky.  You could just let the battery out so you could cheat. 
[03:17:30]  So let's make sure the battery's working.  You just touched the red bit there.  Let's hear it.  There you go.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  We ready to play?  I can handle this.  It seems to be used to say.  Well, you've got to take the mic from this smartphone.  No, we've got to mic him, too.  You've got to mic him.  Put some kind of mic.  You've got to mic the guy.  Oh, God.  We need somebody else.  E-Rock, we don't need you over here.  Mike Twitchells.  Is he going to pick a card, is he?  Yeah, he's going to pick one of the seven cards that... 
[03:18:00]  We should announce when he picks who he's playing with.  Because they've got to be able to play long at home.  All right.  Pick a card, Twitchells.  The office is ringing in this time.  All right.  What you got?  What's the part?  It says breadbasket 1,000.  That would be Danny.  You're playing for Danny right now.  Playing for Danny.  The breadbasket, which is the slang word for his stomach.  No chance in hell.  That is a tiny little...  Remember, the breadbasket was easy because it had the handle you could pin onto.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Here we go.  Pick up those tweezers. 
[03:18:30]  And even if he gets this one, he's got to run through all of them because if there's  a tie, if he's able to remove two...  But it's all the way towards the left.  Come on, center.  No, you got to use the tweezers to move it around.  Yeah, you can move around.  All right.  Here it goes.  This is very tedious. 
[03:19:00]  How the hell am I supposed to grip it?  Moving around a lot.  Get in there, son.  Holy Jesus.  It's amazing to watch.  Oh, no way.  I'm shaking like crazy.  Is that thing working?  What the hell? 
[03:19:30]  All right.  Here we go.  He's trying.  He can't get a grip on it.  He can't.  Oh, Jesus.  The whole board's moving.  He can't use his hand to rest on.  He's trying.  You got to see this video.  That's amazing.  Oh, wow.  He got it out.  He got out the bread basket.  He even turned it around a little bit. 
[03:20:00]  Wow.  Oh.  Danny.  I'm sure this game's working.  All right.  That's one.  Yeah.  Touch the side of the bread basket thing.  Oh, wow.  You really got to make contact on that thing, huh?  You really got to touch it, yeah.  Bastard game.  He just jerked the game out.  It fits the game.  All right.  Dip it in water.  What's the next part?  Here we go, Twichels.  All right.  So far, Danny's got the cash.  He just failed the perfect. 
[03:20:30]  Wrenched ankle.  No fucking way.  That's happening.  No way.  That's coming out of there, baby.  Which one's that one?  Is that the bottom?  That's the bottom of the desk.  Yeah, that looks like a wrench.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  It's a bottom left foot.  Let's go, Twichels.  He's playing operations.  Don't touch the board.  Oh, well, I'll touch this.  Yeah, you can't touch the board.  Oh, well, he was leaning on the whole board the whole time.  The whole board the whole time with the fucking bread basket.  I'm leaning on the countertop.  Now take that.  He told you.  He told you.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:21:00]  There we go.  It's on the market front, isn't it?  There we go.  But it's all the way, like, it's all the way.  Shut up and do it.  All right, just do it.  Enough.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Holy shit.  Fucking amazing.  Is his face?  The shake he just had.  He just shook.  You can't start jumping either.  All right, here we go.  He's going for Anthony's. 
[03:21:30]  I know it's not possible, but the little animated character on the board looks even more scared  than he did.  I don't know if I'm just imagining that.  Come on, Twitchels.  We want to finish this game before we get out of here for the weekend.  Here we go.  I think I got it.  Damn it.  I knew it.  You're fucking switching faster. 
[03:22:00]  Get that fucking bread basket.  That ankle is a bad motherfucker.  I knew when I saw a wrenched ankle I was screwed.  Anthony's out.  The next part.  Damn it.  Butterflies in stomach.  That's mine.  Butterflies.  That's a hard one.  It's a weird shape.  You know what I like is when he hit it, he looked like a doctor that just lost a patient.  He had that really control.  Now, no rest in your hand.  Yeah, you've got to come high.  I'm tired of that.  Kill.  All right.  Here we go.  Come on.  Come on, Twitchels. 
[03:22:30]  You can rest your elbow on the table.  You just can't rest your hand on the board.  All right.  And I think that's in the rules.  Right there, right?  You can do it.  Come on.  Come on.  You can do it.  Let's go.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's gone, man.  He's got nauseous.  He can't even get near the hole there.  He's twitching like a bastard.  His construction's gone completely.  Yeah.  The first one took it all out of him.  He did.  Come on.  Come on.  He's so out. 
[03:23:00]  Come on.  You know one of those doctor's like the sponges?  I can do this.  I can do it again.  All right.  Let's go, Twitchels.  See, you've got to get the bone to my head.  That's what the key is.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  He's gone?  Come on, Doc.  Doc, you can do it.  Come on, Doc.  There you go.  Holy shit.  You took my funny bone. 
[03:23:30]  Let's go.  The fucking morgue is filling up down in the basement of this hospital.  Water on the knee.  That's me.  Oh, water on the knee.  There you go, Twitch.  There you go, baby.  Isn't that the bucket?  I think it is.  Water on the knee is so good.  I think it's a bucket.  The big easy one.  That thing's all really shoved up halfway.  Whatever.  You've got to get in there and move it around.  Slide it to the middle and get it on out by the handle.  Patrice is finally being nice to me.  He was so happy, Patrice. 
[03:24:00]  He dropped it.  He dropped it.  He dropped it.  He dropped it.  The goddamn tweezers.  Oh, my God.  He was so nervous.  Patrice was nice to me.  He dropped the needles.  He was so fucking right, man.  There's no fucking way.  He picked the card.  He knew who it was.  From that time, from the time he picked the card that says what it is, that's game time.  Oh, yeah.  New rules.  That's the way it is. 
[03:24:30]  Do you think if the doctor drops a fucking scalpel into some guy's over the moon?  Listen, we only have three minutes left of the show.  It's game time for brain freeze.  Oh, it's moving, man.  All right.  Let's get it.  We guys, believe it or not, speed this along because we're running out of the sky.  Drizzles, don't drop this.  All right.  Come on.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  Oh!  You're a fucking wanker.  What a wanker.  Ankle bone.  Ankle bone connected.  Ankle bone.  Oh, that's Drew Bogie. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  So the key to this is let him be the first one.  It's a rubber band.  Ankle bone is the rubber band that is wrapped in there.  It's pretty tight.  It usually winds up pulling the tweezer.  After you get it off the peg, it pulls it into the edge.  This is the common tree.  This is the common tree.  Brilliant.  Here we go.  Hey, one hand.  Double-handed technique.  You can do whatever you want.  Yeah.  It's 300.  Can I use two or one?  One.  Anything in.  Just do it.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, he's going to do it.  He's got it.  Oh, shit.  He got it. 
[03:25:30]  Damn.  No, no.  He's still going to get the other bit off as well.  Yeah, but he's...  Don't look at me.  Just look at the ball.  He got it.  Oh, he got it.  Oh, he got it out.  He got it.  He got it.  He had the...  What?  You got the rubber band is out.  Drew Bogie is in.  Oh, you cocksuckers, man.  The Jolly horse.  You didn't give me that fucking...  He dropped that fucking...  Dude, he dropped it in, man.  He dropped it in there, man.  I got a show.  This is Ted Alexandro's piece.  Charlie horse.  Charlie horse.  Here we go.  Charlie horse.  All right.  Where is it at?  All right.  It's a tough one.  Well, we have three winners to split the pot, or will we have two? 
[03:26:00]  Here we go.  Twitchels.  I'm going to get that M piece.  Nah.  Nah.  It is not looking good.  There you go, Ted.  Let's share a camera.  Start up the pointer, sisters, so we can end this program.  All right.  So we got a winner.  We got Danny and Drew Boogie.  They'll split the pot to $35 or whatever it is.  Very good.  We're going to end the show with a little Pointer Sisters jump in honor of Twitchels joining the program.  Wow, Patrice, you got fucked. 
[03:26:30]  You got fucked on that one.  You know that was so fucking wrong.  He dropped it right into his knee.  That's so wrong.  Good rule, man.  Good rule.  He just dropped it.  But your point was well taken.  We've got to promote the food.  Where did the food come from?  Someone get a mic on him.  I want to thank this guy for bringing food.  Give the plug.  Woody McHale.  Thanks very much.  Where's Woody McHale's?  West 14th.  234 West 14th between 7th and 8th.  Yeah, the food was awesome.  Go to Woody McHale's if you're in that area.  It smelled nice.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Ted Alexandro, we'll have to have you back when we can really get into what you're all about. 
[03:27:00]  But he's a really funny comic.  Yeah, he tells the shit.  And he's playing Gotham's this weekend.  Yeah, Friday and Saturday night.  All right.  Yeah, hit that.  And Twizzles, thanks again for coming by.  Oh, what a great idea.  We found out that he has to jump if he hears the word jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  That's how we end the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:27:30]  We just ran out of show.  Patrice O'Neill, a great week of radio.  Thanks.  We'll see you next week.  See you Monday.  All right, man.
