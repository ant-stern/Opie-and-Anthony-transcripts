<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a chaotic segment featuring fart jokes and exaggerated reactions, immediately transitioning into the hosts' typical banter.  James Norton was present in the studio. A significant portion focused on the show's recent move to Chicago after nine months on the air, with numerous Chicago listeners calling in to express their enthusiasm (and some frustration regarding past scheduling inconsistencies).  Discussions included their upcoming "Traveling Virus" comedy tour and the possibility of a Chicago date.  The hosts recounted Fezzy's birthday party, detailing an incident involving E-Rock and a pocketful of Libido Max pills. Opie announced his participation in a nude photoshoot for his girlfriend's photography class, prompting humorous speculation.

Listener calls covered various topics, including opinions on the show itself, the British hostages in Iran (with commentary contrasting their view with Rosie O'Donnell's), the Boston murder rate, and WrestleMania. A heated, profanity-laced argument erupted with a caller accusing the hosts of being pro-George Bush.  Upcoming appearances by Black Sabbath (Heaven and Hell) and Robert Rodriguez were mentioned.  The segment concluded with speculation about "horny housewives" and a potential Geico caveman sitcom.  Throughout, the hosts frequently interjected with jokes, personal anecdotes, and off-topic tangents.

A subsequent 20-minute segment began with a discussion about shortening baseball games to improve TV ratings, quickly shifting to a scathing, highly offensive critique of Rosie O'Donnell's commentary on the Iranian hostage situation.  They played audio clips of O'Donnell's statements, interspersing them with vulgar and sarcastic commentary, attacking her 9/11 conspiracy theories and perceived anti-American bias.  A caller challenged their 9/11 conspiracy discussion, arguing against the theories. The hosts continued debating, escalating their offensive language.  The latter half featured an in-studio interview with Robert Rodriguez, covering his filmmaking process, *Grindhouse*, past experiences (like using a wheelchair as a camera dolly and participating in medical experiments), and various movies including *300*, *Blades of Glory*, *Stranger Than Fiction*, *The Assassination of Richard Nixon*, and *Children of Men*.  They also mentioned upcoming appearances by Bob Saget and Black Sabbath, expressing excitement for *Grindhouse* and summarizing its plot and reception.

The next segment started with a discussion of a chocolate statue of a nude Jesus ("Chocolate Jesus") meant for a Manhattan gallery,  speculating about public outrage and comparing it to the lack of outrage towards Easter bunnies.  The hotel's decision to pull the display and the artist's offers to display it elsewhere, including the Opie and Anthony studio, were discussed.  The "Chocolate Jesus" transport in a refrigerated truck was reported. The hosts debated public oversensitivity to nudity and the perceived power of those expressing outrage. The conversation then shifted to a Ringling Brothers clown's lost miniature bicycle, found by a homeless man, with cynical and offensive commentary on circuses, homeless people, and the relative value placed on the clown versus the homeless man.  Opie shared a childhood memory about a broken circus toy, interweaving commentary about his father's drinking.

The main event was an in-studio interview with Black Sabbath (Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, and Vinny Appice).  The conversation covered vocal technique, touring, their new album ("The Dio Years"), replacing Ozzy Osbourne, sound checks, personal lives (including suggestive comments about women), and their reaction to being on South Park.  Jimmy Norton's enthusiasm as a fan was highlighted.  Technical difficulties with studio microphones occurred. A phone call with the "Chocolate Jesus" artist and Bill Donohue of the Catholic League resulted in a heated debate about the statue's artistic merit, public display, and their respective viewpoints.  Strong opinions, accusations of dishonesty and bullying, and offensive language from all participants marked the conversation.

A subsequent segment featured a further discussion with Cosmo, the "Chocolate Jesus" artist, and Bill Donohue.  Donohue criticized the art, while Cosmo defended his artistic expression.  Accusations of bullying and intolerance were exchanged.  The hosts questioned both parties, exploring art, religion, and public reaction, touching upon depictions of religious figures across cultures and perceived double standards. The segment ended with a somewhat conciliatory tone, but the hosts later angrily addressed a listener message board misrepresenting a host's health, using vulgar language and threats of legal action. The final segment included casual banter and continued use of crude and offensive language.

The final excerpt began with a quick dismissal of a hormone patch for post-menopausal women.  The conversation then jumped to Opie's mysterious meetings with florists, laxative-laced donuts given to middle schoolers as an April Fool's Day prank, derogatory comments about Yankee fans ("fags"), Opie's loneliness, crude and sexually suggestive questioning of a studio audience couple, inappropriate jokes about potential sexual interactions with female interns (and fear of lawsuits), an interview and hiring of a young woman seeking an internship, a brief discussion of a previous awkward guest ("Steve the Whistler"), childhood pranks (often involving racist elements and blaming Black people), a caller's story about Viagra in a teacher's coffee, a happy birthday wish for Fezzy, a caller's confession to being a "take it too far" kid, jokes about Opie's nude photoshoot, and concluded with a crude "line of the day" joke.  Frequent interruptions, digressions, and vulgar language characterized this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Waylight breaks.  Creeping through the shadows.  An unstoppable force.  Lays in wait.  Ready to strike.  Oh my god!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I get scared.  I think I'm scared.  Oh god!  Holy mother of god.  Come on boys, please don't. 
[00:00:30]  Stop!  God damn it.  What the?  What?  Oh, it stinks so fast.  Oh my god.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  Uh oh.  Just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my god!  I'm telling you, Jonathan!  You're gonna stand here.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  Oh!  Shut up!  Oh!  Oh my god! 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I'm stung because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to keep this...  E-Rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  And good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Jimmy looks at me.  He goes, uh...  Do intros take a long time to do?  I'm like, no.  I don't think so.  We've been asking you for a new intro for weeks, Steve.  For weeks!  Stop being Pablo Picasso and get the damn thing done.  This is radio.  I think there should be, like, a template.  Why is it taking so long? 
[00:02:00]  We just pop in our names.  We're angry.  I hope you're angry.  No.  Because I don't want to have to redo it two weeks after I do the new one.  So I'm going to do it right.  How about a template, Michael?  No, it's not a template.  It's something you actually have to...  It's something you actually have to...  All right, how about this?  Just take it off the air and we'll play an old one.  Okay.  Please.  Done.  New intro tomorrow.  Like, a 10-year-old one.  Huh?  That'd be funny.  Are you offended?  No, but the insinuation that it takes 13 seconds to create an intro, why don't you have a listener do it? 
[00:02:30]  Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.  What?  Steve, what?  You're wrong this time.  No.  We've been waiting for weeks.  It's not that we've been waiting a week.  We just have other production that's got to get done for the week.  No, but when we ask for a new intro, we need a new intro.  All right.  Simple as that.  The other stuff has to wait, then.  All right.  The other stuff waits.  Oh.  Good Monday today.  Good morning to you on this fine Monday.  By the way, let me tell you something.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:03:00]  Sitting here.  That awful intro that we don't like is playing.  And phones just start ringing, ring, ring-a-ding-ding.  All Chicago calls.  Yeah.  Chicago is motivated for the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't see a call from New York right now.  I don't see a call from Philly.  I don't see a call from Boston.  I see Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago.  Good morning, Chicago.  Who we're speaking to right now. 
[00:03:30]  Live.  And some dummy from Maine.  Let's say hi to Michelle in Chicago.  What's up, Michelle?  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Hi.  Just wanted to say, finally, you guys are live in Chicago after nine months of being on the air.  I finally get to hear you.  It's great.  Which is, go ahead.  No, go ahead.  I just want to say it's a traveling virus tour that's going to come this way.  I'm hearing rumors we're not going to Chicago.  Oh, great.  Well, that's okay because I'm coming to Vegas anyway, so there you go.  Okay.  No, I'm hearing rumors that we're not going to Chicago. 
[00:04:00]  We've got to figure that out.  They're a little scared of Chicago.  I'm saying, I'm telling you, we could sell out something in Chicago.  Yeah.  Get us a 500-seat theater.  Get us the Zanies downtown.  It's 150 seats.  We'll have fun.  We'll pack it, I hope.  That's right.  We'll pack Zanies.  And this is how you know we're happy to be live in Chicago.  Is Oprah saying something you talked it over with?  No, you go ahead.  Yeah.  We weren't even yelling at you.  The first day of school, happiness, but tomorrow I'll be spitting on you.  It's kind of exciting.  I mean, we're live in Chicago now, but now we're on at like five in the morning to eight 
[00:04:30]  in the morning, which is always just, that's the deal we got in Dallas, and it's just  kind of weird.  It's kind of hard to get an audience going.  Well, the rest of the Chicago radio and talk show in the morning, as you know, besides  Eric and Kathy, there's even worse ones out there.  Eric and Kathy, not them again.  There's more shows out there than Eric and Kathy.  But it's very exciting for WCKG because Mr. Meyer starts today.  Okay.  And we're live.  You don't care about him? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know who that is, but okay.  Oh, he's only a legend in Chicago radio.  I have no idea what that is.  All right, Michelle.  Thanks for calling.  All right.  Bye, madam.  Let's go to Chester's Ashes in Chicago.  What's up, buddy?  Hello.  Hey.  Hello.  Bill in Chicago.  What's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  What's going on?  I'd like to hear you live in Chi-Town.  Yeah.  Why are you guys so excited that we're live?  I mean, the phones are going crazy. 
[00:05:30]  Well, I don't know if it's that we're excited that you're live or we're just excited,  period, to have some decent radio on the airwaves for a change.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Are you going to accept us eventually?  I've been listening to you guys since Jimmy used to throw out the It's Not Gay Unless You  Push Back reference.  Oh, my God, sir.  That's a 1975?  That's one of my favorite Jimmy lines.  That should be on a T-shirt.  That should be a motto.  I love you guys.  You guys are great in the morning.  Thank you, sir.  I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old, and I've always been scared of Chicago 
[00:06:00]  because you hear the stories.  They only like their own.  They don't like when shows come into their town, into their city.  They don't really accept outside shows for the most part.  I think what it is is there's a lot of people here that don't get your style of humor.  And to me, I enjoy it.  There's a bunch of guys that listen to you guys every morning that I talk to,  and you guys are fantastic.  So keep up the good work.  Oh, thank you, Bill.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, mister.  Take care.  All right. 
[00:06:30]  Let's go to Jerry in Chicago.  Jerry.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, man.  What's going on?  Hey, how come the traveling virus isn't coming?  I don't know what's going on with that.  I'm not happy with that.  I told Pete, look, if it means a smaller venue, so be it.  We've got to get to Chicago.  We've got to get this done.  Exactly.  I was thinking if someone were to get online and start a petition,  get a couple maybe thousand or so signatures, and you gave that to management,  you think that would help at all? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I think so.  It couldn't hurt, dude.  I think so.  They're not really sure of the interest in Chicago.  That's what I've been told.  The ratings are just starting to move upwards, finally.  Nothing to brag about, but we're getting little bump-ups,  and they're not sure if that's enough to get the tour to go to Chicago.  But I think we should go to Chicago no matter what.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Hopefully, now that you guys are live, the ratings will go up more.  Best show, best show I've ever heard.  You guys are great. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Jerry.  All right, thanks a lot.  All right.  So there you go.  Just want to acknowledge that we're live in Chicago.  I mean, they're ringing off the hook.  That's very, very cool because it's like 5.07 in the morning right now.  It's awful.  Just an awful time.  It is rough.  Cold city.  Yeah.  What's going on, Anthony?  Hello?  Yes.  I thought you went to a phone call.  No, I'm looking right at you.  I'm like, what's going on, Anthony?  Anthony from the studio.  You're on.  You know, you plunk down phones and yell out names.  And then I looked in horror and saw no Anthony on the phone thing. 
[00:08:00]  I'm like, oh, my God.  He's talking to me.  I know there's a naked girl and pal talk, but.  No, I don't even have any of the cameras up.  All right.  I'm just reading things that are going by.  That's all.  Oh, you're missing out.  I'm fine.  Thank you.  How was your weekend?  Good.  Went to the Fezzy's birthday party on Friday.  Hope he showed up there.  That was fun.  It was a good time.  Yeah.  We had a good time there as Iraq even showed up in his crazy Eddie suit. 
[00:08:30]  Iraq was dressed well.  He was dressed in like a T-shirt and a blazer.  And I swear it looked like crazy Eddie attire.  What year was that?  Like 19.  I'm trying to figure it out.  I think it was brought back for Miami Vice, but he didn't have like a colorful neon shirt.  I think a blazer with a T-shirt.  That's late 80s.  Were you on your way to do evening improv?  Mid 80s.  Evening of the improv.  Did he have wacky suspenders underneath?  Yeah, the thin piano tie.  And we were all looking at him like mocking him. 
[00:09:00]  And he just thinks that we purposely try to mock him every chance we get.  You just make it so easy, Iraq.  I mean, we're all looking at him like why the blazer and T-shirt?  And you're like, I'm sick of what?  Dressing like crap or something?  What did you say?  Yeah, I dress like crap every day.  So I figured...  Figured you'd dig into the closet and find something?  Yeah.  It's cool.  You should have like left a little bit of growth and gelled your hair back.  I just want to snap him.  Wear some just shoes with no laces, with no socks. 
[00:09:30]  Ew, no.  Things like that.  Dude, you looked ridiculous.  Oh, God.  You really did.  Wow.  Driving the point right home.  Dude, you looked ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Because you were trying way too hard.  Like, we're all just hanging and you're hanging out with a blazer on.  You look like someone's dad.  Like, you were there to pick up somebody and bring them home.  Is there any pictures of you, Iraq?  You got a picture of you and your blazer from...  Everyone's giving you a hard time.  ...Broadernite?  Oh, someone must have.  There were cameras snapping like crazy. 
[00:10:00]  Everyone's giving you a hard time.  I don't like it.  Yeah.  It was a really...  It was just like...  What color t-shirt were you wearing?  It was like beige.  It was like a beige t-shirt and the blazer over it.  And all I could think of was, he's insane!  It was definitely crazy, Eddie, like...  Yeah, we were all like, what is Iraq doing?  Yeah.  And then there was a little controversy.  Huh?  Then there was a little controversy about some item that fell out of Iraq's pocket. 
[00:10:30]  That somebody picked up and, of course, gave to everybody first.  And told where it came from.  And then discreetly gave it back to Iraq like she hadn't told everybody that it fell out of it.  Iraq's pocket.  Why is he looking at you like he has no idea what you're talking about?  Do you know what I'm talking about, Iraq?  No.  It was like a plastic thing and it had some pop-out things and a few were popped out.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sitting there with my girlfriend and this girl leans over. 
[00:11:00]  You know, like, nice cough drops?  It's that aluminum thing and there's these black pills.  She goes, these are yours?  No.  They're not...  They weren't mine.  Oh, the story changes.  Oh, boy.  Then why did you put them in your pocket?  The story changes.  They were some type of...  What were they called?  Libido Max.  No, that wasn't mine.  They were made for...  It's like a, you know, sex enhancement drug.  Boner pills.  Called Libido Max with a few already taken out and used. 
[00:11:30]  And I heard that the girl said when she gave them to you that you were just holding them for...  Who?  For Pitsy or someone?  No, that's not true.  Because I was sitting there with a couple people and my girlfriend was right next to me.  And we both looked down and were like, no, that's not mine.  She goes, okay, and took them back.  What did she expect you to say with your girlfriend there?  You can't hand somebody libido pills with the chick right there.  I heard she didn't take them back either.  You took them back and put them back in your pocket.  I never took them.  No.  Wow.  Controversy. 
[00:12:00]  Wish I would have been watching.  Happy typing girl was sitting right next to me too.  And she saw it.  She was happy and typing at the time.  How could she see?  You know what?  I think we need to talk to some of these people that were at the event.  Yeah.  See exactly what happened.  So you're claiming they're not yours?  If they were mine, I would say so.  Did you or did you not put them in your pocket?  No, did not put them in my pocket.  Where did they end up?  Where did they end up?  She still had them.  The girl had them.  I don't know because when she came back, she told me, she said, Eric said that they belong 
[00:12:30]  to someone else and that you were holding on to them for them.  Well, she's lying.  And that you took them and put them back in your blazer pocket or some pocket.  No.  Nope.  All right.  All right.  I have to believe E-Rock now.  I don't think it ends here.  Don't, you know.  Oh, believe me.  It won't end here.  I'm sure the pests right now are emailing and texting each other.  You got to call the show immediately.  Wait.  Now, were they not yours or do you think somebody put them in the glove compartment of your trans  M? 
[00:13:00]  How was WrestleMania?  It was great.  Oh.  What a big surprise.  Donald Trump didn't get his head shaved.  Didn't have to shave his head.  Vince McMahon.  I really thought it might be possible.  Stupid storylines.  Vince McMahon had to get his head shaved.  I heard it was a great WrestleMania, though.  It was very good.  Yeah, I heard it was really good.  The popularity of the WWE is way on the rise again.  Oh, I understand.  They sold out what?  81,100 something. 
[00:13:30]  81,000.  Was Dane there?  What happened?  Yeah, I know.  It sounds like traveling virus.  Can you imagine?  It's on pay-per-view, but they still sell it out.  81,000 nosebleed seats all the way to the top.  They do it.  They're alive.  We're in Detroit, right?  Detroit, yeah.  You went to Detroit?  No.  No, he just got the pay-per-view.  That's cool.  All right.  Let's say for that way.  And there's rumors that there's nude photos of me out there.  I happened to call Fezzy in the middle of a photo shoot on Friday.  Yes.  It was Fezzy's birthday from the Ron and Fez show on Friday. 
[00:14:00]  That's why we all went out on Friday night.  And in the middle of some kind of photo shoot that was...  Did you hear the phone call?  Yes, I heard the phone call.  It was very disturbing.  I almost had to shut it off.  I was in the middle of a photo shoot, and I was talking to Fezzy butt naked.  Yeah.  There may, there may not be nude photos out there.  People are trying to find them, though.  Well, they have to make it online, which I think won't take long if they get out. 
[00:14:30]  How are they going to make it online?  Well, I'll put it this way.  If it's a school project type thing, they have to be turned in.  Yeah.  Once they're handed in, it's over, Johnny.  Right.  They get scanned in, popped up online.  Well, my girl is taking a photography class, and I thought it was a great idea at the time.  But I've become the model for the subject.  For her photos.  And it started instant enough with just a face shot with me in a hooded sweatshirt. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Black and white artistic.  Black and white artistic.  And now we're going into areas that, quite frankly, I'm uncomfortable with.  A little concerned.  And then on Friday, in the middle of that, I remembered that I got to call Fezzy for his birthday.  God, I wish him a happy birthday.  I'm walking around completely new talking to Fezzy on Friday.  Just like he'd like it.  And then he kind of slipped at the end of the phone call. 
[00:15:30]  When I hung up, all I heard on the radio was, hot ass, Opie's naked.  Like, with excitement, I've never heard in another man before.  Hot ass, Opie's naked.  Yuck.  Wait a minute.  You're modeling naked?  That's really bothering me.  It really is.  You're on a bench with your, like, one leg propped up and just photographing?  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out, like, what the pose is. 
[00:16:00]  There might be some artistic shots out there.  Yuck.  Anyway.  What the pose is.  What are your poses, Opie?  Picture.  You're laying down on a couch.  Like, what's her name there in the Titanic?  I was just thinking, or Burt Reynolds.  Yeah, Burt Reynolds.  I was just about to say, I said, picture Burt Reynolds.  Circa 1975.  Where you put your arm and covered it with your forearm.  Huh?  Where you put your arm down there and covered up your goods. 
[00:16:30]  Yeek.  All right.  Uh, oh, well, now we got Dave in Pennsylvania.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, yeah.  Uh, Eastside Dave's been taking those libido, Max.  So he doesn't have any, uh, performance issues with Casey.  Right.  I'm just...  Has he been, uh, taking those?  Oh, no, he's just...  There's just, uh, that rumor started.  Uh, Rich in Boston, what's going on?  Oh, yeah, I was doing the thinker.  Thank you, Bill, from Waterford.  The thinker?  I was doing the thinker.  And, yes, I was doing some Zoolander poses.  I actually was, just as a goof. 
[00:17:00]  Because that's just a wonderful flick.  Ah, Rich in Boston, what's up?  Did you do Magnum?  Huh?  Did you do Magnum?  Yeah.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was a huge, uh...  Just, I don't understand the whole ratings thing.  You guys, uh...  Kick everywhere I go, the radio's on opening, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  I work construction sites.  All I hear is you guys.  Everybody's talking about you guys.  I was a huge die-hard, uh, die-hard, uh, Stern fan. 
[00:17:30]  And the show was just unbelievable.  Oh, thank you, sir.  No, we're doing, uh, we're doing fine in Boston.  Last month, the ratings were beyond weird.  It should be unbelievable, though.  I'm telling you, everywhere I go, you'll listen to me.  Anthony's made me almost piss my pants on the way into work.  Well, watch yourself.  Don't do that.  Yeah, don't do that.  You gotta get to work, and they'll make fun of you.  Well, I, uh...  I'm sorry, buddy.  When I was in Boston, the, uh, the response was really good.  And I know that that's not just from, uh, from XM.  It can't be the ratings.  It's like you can kind of tell when you go into a place where the XM markets are and where 
[00:18:00]  the terrestrial markets are, because the terrestrial markets, you just sell a lot more tickets.  Everyone's told us ratings are weird.  You can't just take a month by one month.  That's how it is.  They go up, they go down.  You gotta take an average.  So, whatever, whatever, whatever.  Yeah, we're, we're fine with what's going on in Boston, so it'll work out in the end.  I appreciate it.  It looks like the murder rate is way up in Boston, huh?  And Mayor Menino's trying to, like, uh...  Right.  Not my fault.  Trying to sweep that under the rug.  Supposedly the murder rate is up 60% year to year. 
[00:18:30]  60%?  Supposedly.  I was reading that in the Boston Herald this morning.  You know anything about that there, Rich?  A lot of gang violence up there these days.  No?  No, I don't, don't care.  I don't know.  But, uh, you guys, the show is unbelievable.  And, uh...  That's all he wants to talk about.  All right.  He's a politician.  He's a good boy.  I like him.  Thank you, sir.  You're a good boy.  Uh, let's say hi to Scott in Iowa.  Scott!  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Thank you, sir.  I had a guy say that to me in the street. 
[00:19:00]  I'm walking to the cellar on Friday or on Saturday, and this guy walks by and goes,  love you, love the show.  Like, uh, Jesus, they don't miss anything.  I got it at the Islanders game on Saturday night.  Love you.  Love the show.  Stupid Islanders!  Aw.  Anyway, I have an idea for a new bit.  Yes, go ahead.  Picture Opie naked.  Well, might not have to soon.  Absolutely.  We could just pop up a website.  New bit, old thought.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We got, uh, Black Sabbath.  I mean, we got this really long couch behind Jimmy and Anthony, so it looks like we got the 
[00:19:30]  whole band coming in.  Yeah.  That's gonna be cool.  Well, that's, uh, that's for Jimmy, to be quite honest with you.  Jimmy's gonna have a lot of fun with Black Sabbath.  I'm beyond happy.  Is, uh, RJD coming in also?  RJD?  Dio?  Yeah.  Yeah?  He even said to me before, Tony said, we'll see you Monday morning, and Ryan's like, I  know we're going to see you guys on Monday.  They're the nicest guys on Earth.  Yeah, they're very nice.  Ron and James Dio is, uh, singing for this version, Heaven and Hell.  Yeah.  You can just call him Black Sabbath.  That's who I'm gonna call him. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Right to their faces.  Why don't they...  Right to their faces.  They say former members, or they say current members, right, of Black Sabbath and...  The official name of the band is Heaven and Hell, right?  Heaven and Hell.  Educate me here.  Even though it's Black Sabbath without Ozzy, but they've also been Black Sabbath with  Ronnie James Dio, so what's the deal here?  I'm thinking since the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I think they just want to clarify.  I don't know.  I'll ask them, because Vinny is playing drums, but he was on three of the albums.  Vinny's not a brand new guy.  He was on Mob Rules, Heaven and Hell, and I think Dehumanizer, and he played on the Heaven  and Hell tour, and, you know...  Apparently, where are they playing? 
[00:20:30]  They played at Radio City?  Sold it out in 25 minutes.  And I had to drive through town Friday night to get to the Ron and Fez birthday party, and  I passed Radio City.  The crowd that was around out there was frightening.  I just got to say, frightening.  There's old guys with these concert shirts on, guys with the horseshoe bald head, but with  the long ponytail, and the concert t-shirts on, the jackets. 
[00:21:00]  I was driving through going, oh my god, this is like a time machine where everyone got  old.  They said that, and they said the tickets were so expensive.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was younger people in Canada, and they said, here, the tickets are like 75 or  100 bucks, and a lot of people in their 20s can't afford that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Oh god, high prices.  I went to see Bob Saget on Friday.  He taped his HBO special.  How'd that go good?  Oh man, he's got a good one in the can.  Good for Bobble.  He's got a good one in the can.  He's got a good one in the can, does he?  He might as well. 
[00:21:30]  The material he was doing.  Yeah.  It's not too far-fetched.  Holy crap.  People are digging it.  I was talking to the HBO people.  America's going to be really surprised, and they're trying to say, well, the dirty side  of Bob Saget's getting out there.  I'm like, not really.  I mean, he was in The Aristocrats, but how many people really saw that movie?  Most people, parents just plop their kids in front of that friggin' full house show.  Right.  They still watch it like crazy.  And America's Funniest Home Video is still in syndication and One vs. 100.  I mean, he did our comedy tour, so some of our fans have been exposed to the dirty Bob  Saget. 
[00:22:00]  He's done some dirty stuff on our show, so some fans.  But I'm telling you, this is going to be his coming out freaking HBO special where people  are like, this is Bob Saget?  Yeah.  They're going to be really surprised.  But he got, it was great.  He did really well on Friday.  And here's the difference between The Aristocrats.  Because everybody, with very few exceptions, was dirty in The Aristocrats.  So that was almost like, okay, he's just doing it like everybody else is doing it.  See a guy on his own, just doing his own material.  Right.  And I'm like, wow, this is him.  This is his act.  And this is really Bob Saget.  He's been fooling America for decades. 
[00:22:30]  But supposedly, the older guys say that he's always been one of the dirtiest comics in  the club.  And finally, with this HBO special he did, America's going to see that.  It's an hour of just filth.  Good for him.  And I think it's going to do very, very well.  All right.  Also, we got Robert Rodriguez from Grindhouse stopping in.  He's the director of the first film.  Grindhouse is a double feature.  I think people know that by now, right?  Double feature.  And he directs the first movie. 
[00:23:00]  Supposedly, we're seeing Grindhouse tonight?  Yes.  Supposedly, we're going to go see Grindhouse tonight.  I hope so.  All right.  We got lots to do.  We're just getting started.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:23:30]  I wanted to wake up the horny housewives this morning.  Horny housewives.  Are they the ones putting the uneven load in the washing machine so it vibrates a little more?  And then, well, you know.  That old gag.  Washing a bunch of sneakers.  Yeah, throw some sneakers in there, and then maybe you're a little too close to this machine.  That's how I wanted to start the show, but instead we just babbled about who knows. 
[00:24:00]  I don't even remember what we talked about in the first break.  We babbled.  Your body?  Nude?  Stupid Chicago.  Who cares?  Nude.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  Keep listening, please.  Oh, yeah.  And my nude photos.  You have nudity?  No, horny housewives.  I was just thinking there might be something there.  Yeah.  You got the desperate housewives, but we all know what that really means.  We're talking about horny housewives.  Yeah.  You know who you are.  Your marriage sucks, but you got a bunch of kids. 
[00:24:30]  Kids, a lot of responsibility.  And life is comfortable, so you figure, what the hell, I'll get my jollies in other ways.  Kids are off to school.  The husband is off to work.  And you're kind of walking around with slinky little outfits.  Slinky.  When the FedEx guy arrives, or the paperboy arrives, or the gardener.  Hey, fella.  You think there's some horny housewives out there waking up?  Of course there are.  Thinking about how she's going to, uh... 
[00:25:00]  I want to use the word, but I, you know...  Take care.  Take care of herself.  Not necessarily take care.  Oh, you mean, uh...  I'm not talking about the sluts.  I'm talking about just the horny housewives.  I don't think they're going, uh...  They're not taking it all the way.  They're just kind of, like, flirting.  They're kind of showing off what they got a little bit.  Are they teasing?  I thought they were using items around the house to, uh...  Oh, well, that...  Yeah, certainly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  But as far as, like, just an all-out cheating going on, no. 
[00:25:30]  It's more like just a little flirtation when the husband's gone and the kids are off to school.  A little whoopsie when the mailman comes.  Exactly.  Whoopsie.  She has her little lingerie still on, and she's trying to cover up.  Trying to cover, but then she's got to grab the package that the FedEx guy or the mailman or UPS guy is bringing.  So she fumbles with it, and her robe kind of opens up.  Whoopsie.  She may even be brave enough to just walk in, get the mail, and just some kind of lingerie. 
[00:26:00]  All the neighbors know about it and hate her.  Yeah.  Because she's keeping her body up to date.  She goes out, yeah, pick up the newspaper, take out the garbage, and her slinky little...  Boy, the phones are exploding with horny housewives.  It's amazing, like when we do a guy-related thing.  Just like it.  And maybe they'll call.  Maybe they're too scared.  Maybe they're sleepy from all their whoring yesterday. 
[00:26:30]  Well, if Chicago would stop calling, maybe we could get some horny housewives to call.  All right, we're live in Chicago.  We get it.  No, it's quite flattering that everyone's calling us this morning to welcome us to Chicago finally.  We've been there almost a year, but now that we're live, I guess it makes a huge difference.  All right, so we got the horny housewives.  We're waking up this morning.  Good luck to you.  And we got Rosie O'Donnell just babbling.  God, did I actually say a month ago that I kind of like her? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I guess I'm trying to fend myself, but I like Rosie O'Donnell because she's speaking her mind on TV.  You don't really get that in this day and age.  But now she's just babbling.  The woman has a screw loose.  She absolutely does.  She's talked about her mental problems, which is fine, you know.  She's on medication.  There was, I guess, what put her over the edge was Columbine.  She talked about that.  She said how when that happened, she just got this unsafe feeling, and she became depressed, and it took her a lot of years to get help. 
[00:27:30]  And she finally got the help she needs, and now she sounds crazier than ever.  Yeah.  Like, she sounded fine when she said she was crazy and wasn't getting help, but now she's getting help, and she sounds absolutely out of her mind.  And I was telling you in the office, she's looking more and more like Kathy Bates from Misery every day.  She's really, she's got the cuckoo eyes.  Mr. Man. 
[00:28:00]  Her eyes are slowly but surely changing.  Yeah, she's getting those crazy eyes.  And the crazy eyes, like, your eyeball flattens out.  Something happens with your eyes.  They, you know how everyone's got a nice curvature to the front of their eyeball?  Crazy people's eyes flatten in their head like frying pans.  It's just an illusion.  And, yeah.  Because I think the eyes, the eyes just start opening up more.  Yeah, they open wider, and they stare off into space.  Look, everyone could do crazy eyes.  Give me crazy eyes.  Just take both of your eyelids and just lift up a little.  There you go.  Open them up. 
[00:28:30]  Crazy eyes.  Now just kind of look.  Yeah, okay, you got crazy eyes right there.  Wow, that was scary.  See, you know what the thing is?  She got surprised by Columbine.  No one liked it, but it's like, because white people are getting shot.  It's like, they've been doing gangbanging shootings in L.A.  Why didn't that make you feel insane?  Yeah, why isn't she upset about people that just are getting shot on a daily basis?  But I like how she was just kind of, you know, speaking her mind.  But now she's just, she's insane.  Because now she's speaking her mind, and it's crap.  It's just, she opened her yap about the Britain hostage situation. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, no.  The Iranians said that 15 British sailors were in Iranian water.  Might have heard my phone call on the Man Cow Show on this issue.  This very subject.  On this very subject.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony from New York, you're on.  Hey, Tony from New York.  Boy, that Tony with a perfect phone call.  An ass I am.  Perfect opportunity.  That's right.  And I blew it.  I blew it.  Good call.  Yeah, it was a great call, though. 
[00:29:30]  See, again, topical, because it's in the news.  We'll get them eventually.  And you see the footage?  They all had to admit that they were in Iranian waters.  That they're wrong.  The woman, they got one woman also that was part of the patrol.  Yeah.  And they've been making her write notes to her family about how wrong she is and how Britain  has to pull out of Iraq.  And it's all the same propaganda that these extremists use when they get prisoners.  They don't interrogate them in private. 
[00:30:00]  Well, they probably do also.  But they get them.  They parade them in front of television to make them make these statements.  Why was the one British soldier they're showing on TV this morning kind of smiling like he's  a college professor?  I think they told him to smile.  He's got graphs and maps and he's pointing at things like, yeah, we were in these waters  a few times.  A lot of these guys are trained to do something out of the ordinary when they're doing these  to let everybody know, look, I'm not serious doing this.  So maybe him smiling.  Maybe he's a guy that never smiles like all around. 
[00:30:30]  They call him smiley as a joke, like they call fat guys tiny.  Yeah.  So when he's on there and he's smiling, they go, look, the guy's smiling.  It's a crock.  Right.  Either that or he's smiling because there's Arab writing in front of him and there's not  a guy behind him with a knife.  Yeah, ready to lop his head off.  Exactly.  He's smiling too.  My face was 20 years.  Every second you're alive.  Hey, hold that thought.  We might have a horny housewife waking up.  Jennifer in Jersey.  Jennifer, what's up?  Great name. 
[00:31:00]  Good morning.  Hey.  Evening.  How are you?  Good.  Hi.  I just wanted to say good morning to you guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Are you a horny housewife?  I'm a housewife, sort of.  I have a part-time job.  I'm mostly horny most of the time.  So does that count?  Well, so what we were talking about kind of hit close to home with you.  I'm sorry, what?  Do you do anything to take care of this?  You're home alone maybe?  Or do you wear a little lingerie or a little robe around the house when the mailman comes 
[00:31:30]  to the door?  Anything like that?  I listen to you and I masturbate.  Oh.  We'll accept that.  Before I get out of bed every morning.  So she didn't hear that.  She listens to us and she makes herself very happy.  Well, she takes care of business.  Yeah, before she starts her day.  What do you use?  Your hand?  Or do you use maybe a device?  Or do you use the washing machine?  No instruments. 
[00:32:00]  No instruments.  Just you.  So the alarm goes off.  You hear our voices.  And that makes you do what you do.  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  Are you doing any oopsies?  Are you trying to turn on the neighborhood boys?  What's going on?  Oh, my God, no.  See, we want the real horny housewives.  All right.  You're a beginner.  You're just starting your life of being a horny housewife.  Flirts.  Yeah, let's go to Rich in Syracuse.  Rich.  Hey, how you doing?  Do you a horny housewife?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm a horny housewife.  Yeah, I do oopsies all the time. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, let's see.  Out of the bottom of his shorts leg.  But you sound like a guy.  Oh, no, I have laryngitis.  What's up, Rich?  Hey, I'm a mailman in Syracuse.  I do a walking route.  And every time I drop off one of those Victoria's Secret catalogs to this one girl, she's always in a slinky lingerie piece.  Like, she knows when the catalog's coming.  And she comes to the door to sign for her package?  Well, whenever she has a package, definitely. 
[00:33:00]  And you know that she's doing this on purpose, right?  Of course.  See?  The girl comes in.  By the time I get there, it's like 1030 in the morning.  There's no way that you're up and that slinky that early.  Does she give you a smile?  Does she make believe she's not in lingerie?  What's the deal?  Oh, yeah.  She's trying to cover it up.  She's got one of those, like, every once in a while she has one of these, like, silk robes that she's trying to cover up.  And it conventionally just slips over every once in a while.  Just enough, right?  Just a little oopsie.  And then she's, like, trying to get herself together. 
[00:33:30]  She sets up, like, 2,000 watts of lighting behind her so her silhouette shows through.  Right.  Opens the door and all you see is her silhouette.  Nude.  Nude.  And she acts surprised that you happen to show up at her door at this particular moment.  Like, oh, well, I know this is not the proper clothing to have on, but I've got to get my package.  Oh, I wasn't expecting you so early.  Don't you usually come in an hour later? 
[00:34:00]  I was just getting in the shower.  And you've got to play the game.  Like, all right, look, we both know what's going on here, but I'll play my role.  Signed for this.  All right.  And don't make my pen smell like a trout again.  What, Rich?  I don't care if you're talented enough to pick up the package with both hands and still sign for it.  By the way, why...  By the way, why always trout?  I don't know.  It just seems to be a funny fish.  Why not salmon?  How about a fluke?  Why not tuna?  Trout smell.  How about catfish? 
[00:34:30]  It's always trout.  A catfish.  Catfish stink.  And they have whiskers, ironically enough.  Yeah, they do.  And they're bottom feeders.  Bottom feeder.  Catfish is disgusting.  Anything else, Rich?  It's like Jimmy, a bottom feeder.  Yeah.  Anything else, Rich?  No, that's it.  Thanks, John.  Punch out, guys.  All right.  You might have got our horny housewife thing moving along, hopefully.  Hope so.  If not, we're going to do this tomorrow.  So, ladies, prepare for horny housewife day.  Yeah.  All right.  In the meantime, Rosie. 
[00:35:00]  Rosie.  Sorry about that.  We're talking about Rosie.  Stupid Rosie.  So, she assumes now that the British, this is all done on purpose so we can get into some  kind of war with Iran now.  Yeah, because that's what we want right now.  That's what we want right now when our troops are spread as thin as they are.  And she says this was done on purpose on our part, that the Iranian people are nice people  and we are the villains of the world.  This is what Rosie's saying and that it was done on purpose. 
[00:35:30]  She goes, ladies and gentlemen, look up on a website.  Look up.  We've done this before for Vietnam to get into Vietnam.  She's talking about the Gulf of Tompkins event and, you know, whatever.  Whatever that, you know, you want to believe about that one.  Yeah.  What happened, didn't.  It says it did.  But I don't know.  I don't think the British are sending in 15 of their guys so we can get into war with Iran. 
[00:36:00]  No.  And why would Iran do it?  Do you know what I'm saying?  Like, Iran took them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So give them back.  Give them back.  Well, now they want all kinds of apologies.  The British are saying they never went into Iranian water.  They were in Iraqi water and then they got taken.  But now they keep asking for new things every time they say, okay, we'll let them go.  Well, now we want an apology from Britain that you were in our waters.  Well, we weren't in your waters.  Well, we want one. 
[00:36:30]  Now we're going to parade the hostages around and make them sign things.  And it's just a catastrophe.  I think they ought to just get in there.  A few jets, bomb a few things, pull out, and then ask again, can we have our guys back?  No, you can't do that.  They're religious nuts.  They're religious nuts.  Yeah, but they don't have anything.  I'm not talking about a protracted ground war like we're in with Iraq.  This is stuff that we've done in the past, that Israel's done in the past, England's done.  You fly in with some planes. 
[00:37:00]  You bomb some important things.  And then you fly back.  And then you go back to diplomacy.  And you say, now let the guys go.  And they're outraged that there's outrage.  All right.  I know you're outraged, but let our guys go or else, you know, we got to come back.  And then you do an air battle.  You bomb some stuff.  You come back.  You don't send troops in.  And then they let them go.  It's like Libya.  You bomb enough things.  You kill enough of their kids.  And they let things go.  It's war. 
[00:37:30]  Well, that's not going to happen, though.  It might.  It depends on how long they hold them.  They'll let them go, sir.  I think they'll let them go.  Why is he doing that?  What were they, 10 feet in the water?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Who's looking?  That's how I look at it, to be honest with you.  Because whenever it's like they went into Iranian waters or some other water, it's always like they just went in.  Just barely in.  And you know how much water there is?  They can go hundreds of miles in. 
[00:38:00]  And then I'd be impressed.  But it's usually they just put their little big toe in Iranian water.  They took a dip.  They took a dip.  That's what it was.  We were taking a dip.  It's probably some dumb dare, and now it's all this.  Yeah, I dare you to go like 10 more feet.  Come on.  I dare you.  Oh, like they're looking.  Bang, bang.  10 feet in.  All right, man.  Dude.  No, just to that, like, see that little marker right there?  Yeah.  Yeah, go past that.  And the Iranians want to charge them with spying.  Gee, how good of a spy can you be when you're in British uniforms and there's 15 of you in the water? 
[00:38:30]  What do you think?  They're infiltrating the aquatic life in Iran, you idiot?  Yes.  But Rosie is insane with that.  And then she's insane with the 9-11 stuff.  Hold on.  Dennis in New York.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, I'm tired of the pro-fucking George Bush crap you guys do every day.  First of all, stop.  Oh, no.  All right, hold on, Dennis.  What about the news?  Republican, you guys love George Bush.  Dennis, Dennis.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute, stupid.  You're cursing on the radio.  Dennis. 
[00:39:00]  I'm about Bush.  Did you hear...  Donald has a big, stupid head and she's ugly and fat.  Jesus, get off it.  Did you hear our show maybe last...  Right-wing...  Did you hear our show last week?  Stupid liberal.  Hey, hey, idiot.  Can we actually carry on a conversation?  As much as I do the Republicans.  Can we actually carry on a conversation for a minute?  I'm with this every day.  Hey, idiot.  You started by cursing, so no one even knows what your point was.  Can we actually...  That's how dumb you are.  My point was, you guys are right-wing wackos, man, and I get sick and tired of hearing 
[00:39:30]  this.  Then listen to something else.  You and your buddy, Sean Hannity, who's a homo.  Yeah, who defended the free speech of the show as opposed to the stupid bleeding hearts.  Not one liberal...  Oh, my God.  Weren't we called a liberal Bush...  We were called liberal Bush haters last week.  Dude, we were called liberal Bush haters last week because we were calling him an idiot  who doesn't know how to run a war.  You guys are right-wing wackos.  Oh, shut up.  We got our own minds jack off.  It's like, what, we can't have two opinions on something? 
[00:40:00]  We can't have two sides?  One may be liberal on some ideas, one conservative on other ideas?  You got to take the party line the whole way?  Man, you liberal jerk off.  Shut up.  Shut up.  F off and die, you jack off.  You know nothing, you liberal one-minded creep.  Just die.  Shut up.  Hug a tree.  Hug a tree and have sex with a hairy armpitted hippie broad.  You jerk off.  Can't stand yous. 
[00:40:30]  Who's this?  Now listen to yourself.  Listen to yourself.  Listen to yourself on the radio.  I want to listen.  Give us a frankus and shut up.  Dennis.  Who is this?  Are you done?  No, I'm not done.  You didn't even hear our take on...  You didn't even hear our take on the whole thing.  You guys like sucking them off every day.  You didn't even hear our take on the whole thing.  Did you hear the Rosie audio yet?  You didn't even listen.  Did you hear the Rosie audio yet?  You believe what Rosie is saying?  No, I don't believe what Rosie is saying.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Then what's the problem?  Then what's the problem?  You're going to agree with us today.  I'm saying that you guys are middle of the road.  I'm a registered independent.  No one cares what you are.  So what did we say that is so pro-Bush?  You guys are pro-Bush every day.  Every time somebody calls in.  Not every day.  Give an example.  Oh, wait a minute.  Give an example.  Give one example.  Two weeks ago, I remember somebody called in there, and I guess they made like a joke  about Bush, and all of a sudden Opie was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, so funny.  Maybe the joke sucked. 
[00:41:30]  Opie is the least Bush fan you will find.  He's the most moderate of all of us.  The guy can't stand Bush.  You guys never rag on Bush, then.  We rag on Bush all the time, you jerk-off.  God, are you stupid.  Don't listen half the time and make comments like you listen all the time.  We call the guy a moron every chance we get.  We played part of his speech just last week and goofed on the whole thing.  What are you, stupid?  I never liked Bush.  I've been screaming Obama for months.  God, are you an idiot? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I hate Obama, too.  Well, whatever, dude.  Who do you like that?  Who cares about what you like anyway?  Shut up.  Nobody does care.  No one.  No one cares.  Go whore your mom.  There you go.  Third grade humor.  Shave your head in a mohawk.  Third grade humor alert.  Don't try to be funny and poignant, sir.  You're neither.  What an idiot.  Oh, I can't stand the people that listen half the time.  Go ahead.  Listen half the time and hear only what you want to hear.  We bash Bush and people call us liberal assholes, and then we talk about Rosie O'Donnell being 
[00:42:30]  an idiot on what she's saying, and we're pro-Bush?  No, I'm anti-Rosie O'Donnell, you dumb ass.  It's not about Bush.  It's about Tony Blair anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Clayton in Vegas.  Clayton, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  What?  What's up?  What's happening?  Hey, Wee says hello.  I just got off the phone with him.  Wee's?  Why'd you call Wee's?  I call Wee's every once in a while. 
[00:43:00]  Just for, uh...  Very cool.  Hey, real fast.  Tony from Iowa, from the Instant Feedback.  This guy's an idiot.  Everyone knows that Opie is the bleeding heart, Anthony is the conservative, and Jimmy is  of questionable sexuality.  That's not true.  All right.  So, Clayton...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm a fascist.  That's not true at all.  Just stating the obvious.  Clayton in Vegas, what's...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  You're not a bleeding heart.  Opie?  I love you.  I love the show.  All right.  What do you got, Clayton?  Oh, thanks.  I love you.  I love the show.  Loves the show. 
[00:43:30]  When do you guys come out here?  We're less than two weeks away from the first O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show at the Hard  Rock Hotel and Casino at The Joint out of Vegas, April 14th.  I don't even know if tickets are available, but if they are, go to Ticketmaster.com and check  if they are.  It's going to be a big show.  I have a big surprise.  Ooh.  Do you?  No.  Of course not.  You just say that.  We got eight or nine comedians, all the infos up on OpieandAnthony.com, but tickets are  available through Ticketmaster.com, and the Vegas station has been really, really promoting  the hell out of the show, and we appreciate that. 
[00:44:00]  What else you got, Clayton?  Because we've got to move on to a break here.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you.  That's it?  I'm sure you gave wheeze more than that today.  I'm sorry.  He's got nothing.  All right.  You got nothing.  We'll continue.  We'll get into the rosy audio and some other things.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hit it.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks, Jim, for reminding me.  I do.  I didn't know.  Holy crap. 
[00:44:30]  He's asking me about my Islanders.  Choking when it matters most.  I think they've won three out of the last 13 games.  Out of the playoffs.  Wow.  Hard to do in hockey.  My ticket guy calls me.  So, are you going to get the playoff tickets this year?  I openly laughed at him and hung up.  We're like four points out of the last playoff spot.  Like three or four games left.  It's over, Johnny. 
[00:45:00]  They choked.  We lose our star goalie and the whole team just got depressed.  They got sad.  They were sad.  They all got sad because we lost Rick DiPietro and decided not to play anymore.  What a joke.  I know, the rest of America's laughing because, uh, whatever.  At least baseball started last night.  Yeah.  Mass win.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:45:30]  Uh, well, uh, the horny housewife thing.  I don't know.  Maybe they're a little, a little scared to call us.  A little shy.  But I think we could get some horny housewives to call us today.  Maybe they like to sleep in late because I just picture them with like a martini glass at the end of the night.  When the husband gets on, why don't you just go to bed?  You know, like Dean Warmer's wife.  Right.  They're out there.  They know they're out there.  Cut the crap and get me a drink.  I got the goddamn senior honors dinner tonight. 
[00:46:00]  I love that.  Dean Warmer's wife.  Uh.  She was a cougar.  We had one of those in our, in our face once, huh, Ant?  Oh, uh, oh yeah.  God.  Ah, we'll talk about that another day.  That's the beauty of this show.  One of those parties.  That's the beauty of this show, by the way.  We'll kind of tease something and eventually we'll get to it.  Ah, we'll get to it one of those days.  When it, when it makes sense.  But right now we should just let that sit there. 
[00:46:30]  Just let it sit there.  But if you're a horny housewife and you're waking up, we want to hear from you today.  Do you do little oopsies?  We're not talking about like banging all the kids in the neighborhood.  No.  We're just talking about that little flirtatious thing you do and maybe you, maybe, uh, there  was a guy and we didn't get to him because that stupid guy was yelling and screaming at  us.  A really good phone call.  He says that, uh, he watches this woman wash her like, uh, windows and tiny, tiny shorts  and she knows she's doing it.  Those are the stories we're looking for today.  You know, the women, uh, they just want to flirt a little bit. 
[00:47:00]  They're bored.  The kids are at school.  The, the, the husband who, who has no interest in her anymore is off to work.  And you know, you got the, the FedEx guy coming by the mailman, maybe a neighbor, maybe  the paper boy.  She's doing something like a gardening, just a little flirtatious, uh, behavior.  Washing the windows in her little boy shorts.  Yeah.  Well, we had one of those, but the guy had to yell that we're what pro Bush or something.  Yeah.  That we're right wing.  I'm just.  Uh oh, what happened? 
[00:47:30]  What happened?  Uh, this, I can't wait.  Oh, it's gotta be funny.  The caveman.  This is, uh, they're doing that sitcom on the, the Geico, uh, commercial caveman.  That is gonna be funny.  Oh, oh, why?  Yeah.  Why?  Because they're so popular.  People are just laughing and laughing. 
[00:48:00]  Did the, where's the beef lady get a goddamn, uh, sitcom?  Do you know?  The evil angel.  They made her do like tranny porn.  I mean, you know, at first the caveman thing was kind of different and I, I'm not gonna lie  to you.  I, I kind of found a little, uh, a little chuckle here.  It might be amusing, yeah.  The first one.  But to go from that to a sitcom, this is gonna be one of the biggest disasters in sitcom  history.  Mark my word.  A one joke sitcom.  Go Penguins!  Oh. 
[00:48:30]  Wow.  They're shooting the pilot now in LA.  Sorry.  It's alright.  We got three different conversations going on, but I just got excited for the Penguins.  Yes, I'm going for the Penguins this year to win it all.  F the Rangers.  F the Rangers!  Tom, you heard me!  Oh, guys, I don't like sports.  I just root for anyone to play healthy.  Huh?  You guys don't like hockey.  It's not getting hurt out there.  This means nothing to you guys.  Hockey is the sport to watch.  I used to like baseball.  I passed up opening day tickets today.  Baseball is boring. 
[00:49:00]  It started, I'm a Mets fan, uh, you guys are Yankee fans, but it's a boring sport.  No one ESPN should do.  They should do a 20-minute version of baseball games.  It would be the biggest hit on TV.  They could do it, yeah.  Like, where, you know, you just make sure you, you know, you have no media on, which  is almost impossible in the year 2007, I understand, but then just have, like, not a highlight  show, like a 20-minute version of the game.  The whole game, but just action.  In a 20-minute, not necessarily. 
[00:49:30]  Some of that other interesting stuff that happens, the pitching changes, and maybe a really  good at bat, you know, you figure out what are the, uh, a little more than the highlights,  and throw it into a 20-minute package.  I'm telling you, everyone would start watching baseball.  Everybody.  The ratings would go through the roof.  It's, who, I can't, I can't invest three hours in a baseball game on TV anymore.  Not in this day and age, where we all are like this.  You're lucky.  We're all like this, surfing, we're turning the channel, and you're going to sit through 
[00:50:00]  one of these baseball games?  I haven't watched a whole baseball game on TV in years.  Can't do it.  But you do, like, a 20-30-minute version, I'm telling you, it would be the hottest thing.  But that would be thinking out of the box, and I don't think, uh, you know, mainstream  media knows how to do that, unfortunately.  I think they should just cut everything out, except for the action.  Like, all the in-between, the pitching stuff, throw it out.  Right.  Pitch, pitch, pitch, hit, hit, pitch, hit, that's it. 
[00:50:30]  Well, that's more like, see, that's more like highlights.  But the entire game that way.  I'm talking, like, give it, like, 20 minutes, so you get a kind of a feel for what's going  on, you know?  Mm.  Half hour, an hour, even.  That would still mean, like, two less hours of viewing.  But no one would want to go to a game if it was an hour.  No, no, no, I'm just talking, like, you just, the game is played, ESPN takes it, and packages  it into, like, a half-hour, like, version of the game.  So you don't see it live? 
[00:51:00]  No, I mean, that's the only problem.  You got to, like, you know, make sure you don't, you know, get the results or whatever.  It's a dumb idea.  I get it.  Let's move on.  Someone agrees with Rosie about Iran.  So should we play the audio first, and then we'll get to this guy?  Yeah, yeah, let's hear what Rosie said.  All right, Kathy Bates from Misery was on The View last week and had some outrageous things  to say.  It's one of the top YouTube videos this week, or last week, or in the last few days, whatever.  About that, and she's picking up on 9-11 conspiracy crap. 
[00:51:30]  She's just a, that's just crap.  Wait till she gets to the 9-11 stuff.  Oh, boy.  All right, here we go.  Here's what happens.  These guys went here, okay?  Iran said, that's our water.  Get out of our water.  We're taking you back.  Britain says, they took our guys.  Iran goes, no, you were in our water.  Say you're in our water and we'll give you the line.  Where's the line?  What do you think of the cause behind that?  Well, there are many, many ways to think of it, but historically, have governments ever  faked incidents or incited incidents in order to get them into war? 
[00:52:00]  Do you think, do you think it has happened historically?  I'm sure it has.  Yeah, I don't think it's...  All right.  That's a fair question.  Look, that's a fair question, and is it beyond the realm?  No.  But again, this is not the U.S.  It's amazing how liberals want to blame Bush, who is an ass, but this is on Britain.  They want us to stay out of it.  Well, they see Britain as our puppet anyway.  I mean, sure, Britain's been a good ally, but this is on them. 
[00:52:30]  And if we really wanted to start a war with Iran right now, that might be one thing, but  there's no way we could just go in and start a war with Iran with all the crap that's going  on in Iraq.  I agree.  We don't have enough soldiers to do it in the first place.  There's no...  There was even...  There was a protocol involved in the Iraqi thing.  No matter how dumb and fake it was, and, oh, here's my pro-Bush speech, how phony the 
[00:53:00]  intelligence was as far as what got us into the war, how the story of why we were there  changed after they realized that there weren't the weapons they thought were there.  But before that, I mean, how long did we go with trying to get the UN and get France and  Germany on our side and everything and all that stuff that failed, she thinks this could  just, you know, 15 British soldiers getting taken by Iranians is going to get us in a 
[00:53:30]  war?  It didn't in 1979 when there was a war.  How many hostages did they take in 1979?  There was no war.  Yeah.  Carter, who I admired for, tried a helicopter rescue.  He lost eight soldiers.  There was no war started in 1979.  When Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran and chased him out.  And why can't this fat lump of crap realize, oh, not you, Jimmy, I'm sorry.  No, you've lost recently, Jimmy.  Why can't she realize that Iran is a fundamentalist bunch of monsters? 
[00:54:00]  They were protesting that they wanted the English hostages killed.  Of course they were.  They had signs, kill them.  For Allah.  Ah, they must die.  You know, they're a bunch of friggin' fanatics.  Well, Rosie continues with her theory.  Of course she does.  Here we go.  So what do you think is really happening with the shit that was in there?  You think that these British soldiers were used as pawns to try to ignite another war 
[00:54:30]  against Iran?  Well, I just think if Iran really did take them and they really wanted to hold them hostage,  they would have done what they did during the Jimmy Carter era.  Right?  I don't think that they really were taken.  What?  Well, of course they were taken.  But my point is that if they wanted to hold them, but this was a purposeful attack by the  Iranian government to provoke an international incident, why would they say, well, we'll let  them go and we're not going to harm them?  Well, they...  We'll let them go.  We're not going to harm them.  But you have to admit you came into our water.  And British, you know, well, we're not going to admit that.  Yeah, but we're not going to harm them.  We're going to let them go.  Dude, oh, what a moron this woman is. 
[00:55:00]  They say that all the time.  They kept promising they were going to let our hostages go back in 79 also.  They didn't.  They say they're going to do that.  That's one of their tactics.  And then they renege on the whole thing.  And then they parade them in front of the TV with video clips of them forced to sign things.  Well, that's the video we're watching this morning that they're admitting they were in  Iranian water.  So, all right, why aren't they let go yet?  Yeah, why didn't they let them go? 
[00:55:30]  They're still there.  Stop it, Rosie.  You're out of touch, fat dyke.  Then again, I mean, look, do I...  Am I 100% convinced they weren't in the waters?  No.  I don't know.  Who are we to know?  I don't know.  I'm not convinced either way.  But they're not going to kill the hostages.  I don't know why I talk so quietly like that would somehow make my point valid.  They're in a war in a nation that is right next to Iran.  Whether they went 10 feet into their waters or not, I don't know. 
[00:56:00]  I wasn't there.  Apparently, the British have GPS and ship records that show that they weren't in their waters.  But, of course, no one's going to believe that.  They could just conjure that up.  But I'm more willing to believe that they wouldn't send 15 guys in there in a little Zodiac boat to make an international incident.  And how far into the waters were they?  We're talking...  Yeah, it was really nothing.  It was really close, right?  It was less than, I think, a third of a mile. 
[00:56:30]  Are you kidding?  Yeah, like 0.3 of a mile into their waters is what they were saying.  It's something inconsequential.  And the protocol in this situation, it happens all the time, is to escort the ship out of their waters.  That's what happens.  You don't take them and hold them.  You warn them and say, you're in our waters, get out.  And they turn around and get out.  That's what you do.  Why can't...  This is what I love.  People like Rosie, it's never the fault of the Arab nation or the Middle Eastern nation. 
[00:57:00]  Why couldn't it be Iran trying to somehow get themselves mixed up in it?  Why couldn't it be Iran who feels they need some kind of justification to get militarily involved?  And they're using this as an excuse to throw themselves in the mix because they haven't been able to find a way in.  Right.  Why is that not a possibility?  Yeah, how about you speak up on that?  Maybe they want to throw themselves into this whole thing and make England look stupid. 
[00:57:30]  This is Rosie.  Tony Blair wants to get out of there.  His people are hating him in England.  He wants nothing to do with it.  Yeah, he's done.  He's out.  Yeah.  All right.  More from Kathy Bates.  I mean, Rosie O'Donnell.  I'm saying that in America, we are fed propaganda.  And if you want to know what's happening in the world, go outside of the U.S. media because it's owned by four corporations.  One of them is this one.  And you know what?  Go outside of the country to find out what's going on in our own country because it's frightening.  Al Jazeera? 
[00:58:00]  It's frightening.  And if you don't...  Do you think we're being brainwashed as a whole country?  I think not.  I think the democracy is threatened in a way it hasn't been in 200 years.  And if America doesn't stand up, we're in big trouble.  Oh, boy.  How about the Internet?  How about the Cuban Missile Crisis?  That wasn't threatening?  She says it's controlled by four companies.  But how about the Internet?  Yeah.  I think there's a lot more info that is available than it was 10 years ago.  And the stuff she's reading, she's reading one-sided stuff that's the polar opposite of what she's talking about. 
[00:58:30]  We're being brainwashed as a nation.  And then she reads the opposite of that, which is just as bad.  She listens to the BBC.  Yeah, the BBC.  The BBC.  She's listening to Al Jazeera, if you listen to her.  Jesus Christ.  And then Kathy Bates made this point about...  I mean, Rosie O'Donnell made this point about 9-11.  Look for yourself, looking like Kathy Bates every day.  More and more like her. 
[00:59:00]  Crazy eyes.  From misery.  Wow.  Let me ask you one more thing.  Do you think the government purposely misled the American people to believe that Iraq had something to do with 9-11?  No.  Yes, says the crowd.  I don't.  Do you believe that the government had anything to do with the attack of 9-11?  Do you believe in a conspiracy in terms of the attack of 9-11?  No, but I do believe that it is the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel.  I do believe that...  Shut up.  Oh, boy.  Just shut up.  Here we go again.  Watch something and educate yourself, you fat load. 
[00:59:30]  Here we go again.  Oh, the steel thing.  Here we go again.  First of all, when she's talking about the Iranian or Iraqi tie-in to 9-11, I'm with her on that one.  Yep.  I didn't see any evidence of Iraqi involvement in 9-11.  Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, that's fine.  Iraq was busy with Iraq.  Iraq was so self-centered with Saddam in there. 
[01:00:00]  That's all they needed.  Iraq was happy with Iraq.  As far as 9-11 goes, yeah, they tried to make a tie-in.  And we bought it at first with all these weapons of mass destruction and these pictures that they were showing us.  And that was the bill of goods we were sold to get us into the war.  And then when all that started leaking out that it was not true, then it was, we're here to give them democracy. 
[01:00:30]  So when the whole reason for the war changed, that's when everybody started going, uh-oh, what are you doing?  I got to agree with that caller that called about a half hour ago.  You're very pro-Bush.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying now.  It's very pro-Bush.  Sure.  You and Rosie both.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Well, do you hang out with Rosie?  Yeah.  Me and Rosie.  But then when she goes into this 9-11 crap about the first time fire melted steel, why won't people listen to the fact that iron beams do not have to melt to a liquid state before a building falls down, before a steel building falls, especially the way these were constructed? 
[01:01:00]  Why can't people understand that they just have to be weakened a little bit to get a little soft?  And then when those beams bend, the whole structural integrity is gone and the building falls down.  Why does it have to be dripping metal?  Here's the rest of her statement, and then we'll get into this a little bit.  More bull.  More garbage. 
[01:01:30]  It's time in history that fire has ever melted steel.  I do believe that it defies physics for the World Trade Center Tower 7, Building 7, which collapsed in on itself.  It is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved.  World Trade Center 7.  World Trade Center 1 and 2 got hit by planes.  7, miraculously, the first time in history, steel was melted by fire.  It is physically impossible.  And who do you think is responsible for that?  I have no idea.  But to say that we don't know that it imploded and it was an implosion and a demolition is beyond ignorant. 
[01:02:00]  Look at the film.  Ignorant.  Physics expert here from Yale, from Harvard.  Pick the school.  It defies reasoning.  Let's get one.  Let's get one.  You stupid, fat lesbian.  She is a moron.  Who is going to...  You know something?  Please, please, with an open mind, please listen.  If she watched anything on demolition of buildings, I love it.  I love watching these programs on what it takes to demolish a building.  I watch these guys.  They're family-owned businesses. 
[01:02:30]  Been in these businesses for years.  It's grandfathers working with their grandsons.  And what they do is they strip a building.  Then on the support structures inside, they drill a crap load of holes, which are then loaded with explosives.  And then these wires are all brought out the building.  Then they use these big steel tension cables connected crossways up the whole building so that when the beams explode, they're pulled in by these cables. 
[01:03:00]  So that makes the implosion and the whole building fall.  It just collapses without...  Do you know how long it takes to prepare a building for demolition?  Do you know the work involved and what access you need to parts of a building that these people are typing in their cubicles while mom-and-pop operations are bringing fuses in over their heads?  Could you hold this, please?  What is it?  C-4.  Or I'm going to be shoving it in the hole that I'm jackhammering over your head. 
[01:03:30]  Your cubicle just happens to be right next to where I need to be.  And no one has said a word about this.  Can you go take a cigarette break?  This idiot has no idea the engineering it takes to destroy a building and implode it.  And she thinks it just coincidentally they had it loaded up ready to go when two planes hit the tower.  Not one witness came forward to say, yeah, I saw suspicious activity.  I was working late one night and all of a sudden the building's filled with plumbers.  And I'm thinking, why are they here? 
[01:04:00]  Why are they here?  And how come they drilled 18,000 holes in our building?  I'm really serious.  And I don't know why there's 18,000 cables running out to a box a quarter mile away from the building.  Why is that?  No one noticed it.  You know what you guys are missing?  I do know.  I do actually an explanation.  Oh, yes, Jimmy.  There were people working who saw this and they said, what are you doing?  And the construction workers actually said to them, nothing, but just keep this under your hat.  Under your hat, they used. 
[01:04:30]  They said, keep it under your hat.  Mum's the word.  You idiot.  On the question day.  This is between you and I.  That headed moron actually thinks that was a controlled detonation like we've seen many times on TV when they show it.  But if you look a little deeper and know what it takes to demolish a building in that fashion, a controlled demolition of a building, you would understand how stupid that blubbering idiot sounds. 
[01:05:00]  Well, here we go.  Mike in Syracuse.  Mike.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Love your show.  Hey.  I got a couple of things here.  One, you know, it goes both ways because the building being collapsed from the engine fuel from the planes, it collapsed from the thousands and thousands and thousands of pieces of paper that, you know, were burning as well as the engine fuel and a multitude of other things. 
[01:05:30]  Well, everyone knows why the two towers collapsed.  They were hit by aircraft and the fireproofing came off the beams.  The beams then got soft.  And with all that weight above the beams, the buildings came down just like they were supposed to when that happened.  The other building she's talking about, Building 7, was hit with debris in such a way that it started it on fire.  And it structurally destroyed the front of the building when the towers came down. 
[01:06:00]  So it was leaning.  You could see pictures of it leaning over with the entire front of it, the bottom front taken out.  And it's on fire.  So that one, too, was meant to fall down.  The idea that it was a controlled demolition makes this fat dyke look like the moron she is.  And why would you, by the way, why would, once you have the towers down, if they're hit by planes, why do you take 7 down?  That's what we said in the office.  Why do you need to take buildings down?  No one's going to be angry until 7 falls. 
[01:06:30]  It's silly.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't think the towers were necessarily collapsed.  It's like Voss going up after Dane.  Yeah, but I'm definitely, I think that there's questionability at the...  Questionability is not a word, sir.  Yeah.  The Pentagon, I feel, could have been a little conspiracy.  There's no conspiracy.  Look at the information.  And not just the right-wing or left-wing information.  Look at the information that's out there. 
[01:07:00]  It's so obvious what happened.  The most...  God, why do I even bother?  There's...  You could see it.  You could see it was an aircraft.  Well, it's a cruise missile.  They shot it in to...  No, they didn't.  There were Muslim extremists.  They hijacked planes and killed people with them.  One for them.  Around the Pentagon, there's missile defense systems.  They actually are on 24-7.  Yeah, sure they are.  Sure they are. 
[01:07:30]  Where were they?  They're there.  No, they're not.  They're not.  We thought they were.  Everyone was under the assumption that the White House, the Capitol, and the Pentagon had these secret James Bond missiles that came out of the ground when there was a threat.  It doesn't happen that way.  Wait a minute.  I don't even know if he's wrong.  But, dude, why would...  You have to understand.  It was happening so fast.  And civilian aircraft is supposed to be in that area.  Yep.  If that was an attack by foreign planes, then maybe they do have those defense systems.  But maybe they're not, like, up and ready.  If a missile was shot over. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Civilian aircraft.  And by that time, planes were scrambled.  They weren't close enough.  There were things going on.  It's a cluster F that day.  It happened the way everything was supposed to happen.  Just like real humans.  It screwed up.  There wasn't this great plan in place that we wished our government had.  The government's just like every other job you go to.  Go there, you have this impression that it's going to be something, and then you get there and realize it's just a bunch of people doing a job. 
[01:08:30]  And there's mistakes that are made.  Yeah.  And that's what happened.  These missile defenses.  I'm sure there are guys that are ready to run up on the roof with a stinger missile or something on the Pentagon.  But there's no James Bond-looking missiles that pop out of the lawn.  Don't be silly.  A plane hit the Pentagon, just like it hit the trade centers and just like it hit the ground in Pennsylvania.  It just happened.  It was an awful thing.  Don't look for a conspiracy.  Don't look for Fat Rosie for her dopey information off of these stupid websites that are full of nothing but crap. 
[01:09:00]  I will say, though, I think that there's footage of the Pentagon being hit that they haven't released.  I don't believe there's only one camera aimed at that building.  There probably is.  And I'm sure it shows an airplane hitting the Pentagon.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  Punch it out.  Goodbye, Mike.  Syracuse coming on strong this morning, by the way.  A lot of calls from Chicago, Boston, and Syracuse so far.  Good.  Hey, we got Robert Rodriguez.  He's in the green room.  We're going to lighten up the mood a little bit on the O.P. and Anthony Show next. 
[01:09:30]  He is the director of the first movie of Grindhouse.  I oversimplify things.  That's because it's simple.  You're looking to work too hard at this.  Don't work so hard.  The simple answer is the answer.  Muslim extremists pulled one over on us.  They got us.  I know it's hard to believe, and it really is hard to take, because there's no one that  could be held accountable for it.  They got us.  What are you going to do? 
[01:10:00]  Can we get Kathy Bates on the show today?  I mean, Rosie O'Donnell?  Good luck.  She wants her own forum where she can mouth off without anybody getting in her face.  Yep, yep, yep.  She likes blindsiding people.  You know what we have today?  We have Robert Rodriguez coming up on the next break.  Good.  And then we have Black Sabbath.  Black Sabbath at 8.30, yes.  Robert Rodriguez, the director of the first movie of Grindhouse.  It's a double feature.  I don't know if people understand what Grindhouse is all about yet, although the articles are  everywhere now, so I hope they do.  You got two films, and Robert Rodriguez is the director of the first one, and I'm hearing 
[01:10:30]  his film is very, very good.  We'll get into that next.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Right on.  Let's get right into this.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  In studio.  Robert Rodriguez.  What are you doing?  Hello.  We're yapping.  We'll yap on the air, man. 
[01:11:00]  What were you guys talking about?  We're talking about the difference between watching a TV series on a box set, and then  you get in the hotel and you have to watch regular television.  How much it sucks when you're sitting there and you realize they rope you in because they  give you a bunch of movie at first, and you're like, oh, this is good.  Wow.  They haven't played a commercial in a long time.  And then toward the end, it's like five-second blips of the movie in between these huge stretches  of commercial.  You want to kill somebody.  I'm a fan of the marathon. 
[01:11:30]  Or getting the box set and just do it.  You were saying before the show, you did Lost all weekend, right?  Yeah.  You got to do that.  You just pop in disc after disc.  And it's like when I go to Atlantic City or Vegas and I'm playing poker, I'll just be  like, all right, one more hand, one more hand.  And you pop in one more disc, and it ends, and you're like, I'd really want to know what  happens after that.  All right, one more disc.  Just one more.  And before you know it, it's midnight and you got to get up at four.  You got no sleep.  Can I ask Robert a question, dude? 
[01:12:00]  If you did, I'm going to smash my fat face.  Did you direct Swimming with Sharks?  Swimming with Sharks is a friend of mine, George Wang, did that.  All right, you love that movie.  He's a good friend of mine.  It's a brilliant film.  Jimmy loves that movie.  He was an executive's assistant over at Columbia when I was there, and I kept telling him, man,  quit your job and go make a movie.  Look how easy it was for me.  I made all mariachi.  And then he quit his job, and it was a good job.  And I was like, oops.  I hope he makes a movie.  And he did, and he made that terrific film.  Well, you're here to talk about Grindhouse, and the buzz on the movie is unbelievable.  The articles are all over the place. 
[01:12:30]  We had Kurt Russell in on Friday.  He was great for us, man.  And you direct the first film.  A lot of people got to understand, it's a double feature.  Like, this is old school stuff.  It's really crazy.  Well, even in the old days, they wouldn't show two brand new movies together.  Right.  It would be one that had been around for a while, and then maybe a new movie put in together.  Right, right.  But this is just, no, I had an idea about three years ago to do a double feature,  because I'd done a 3D movie that did really well.  3D hadn't been around in a while.  And now it brought back 3D. 
[01:13:00]  There's a lot of 3D movies.  Sure.  I thought, what else was an old school, traditional way to show a movie that would rope in audiences  for today?  Because people have been talking about theatrical exhibition going down, people staying at home  more.  And so I thought a double feature would be really cool.  I took it to Quentin.  He loves double features.  I said, we've got to call it Grindhouse.  And so in like five minutes, we came up with this idea to make this really unique experience  where there'd be two features, two full features, each about 84, 85 minutes long.  Wow.  And then trailers, fake trailers in between for movies that don't exist. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I hear they're hysterical.  And I hear the trailers are just amazing for these movies that don't exist, almost to the  point where you might want to make one of these down the road.  We might have to make all of them.  Right.  It gets such a huge response.  I could sit and watch like old school trailers for hours, man.  You get on some websites and watch them because they were so, you know, action packed.  No, they totally oversell them.  Yeah.  The idea we had with Grindhouse was, you know, back in the day, they'd have these amazing 
[01:14:00]  posters and trailers.  Then you'd go see the movie.  And the movie sucked.  Nothing like that.  Yeah.  So we thought, well, we have the, you know, the means and the time to actually make these  movies better than the posters and better than the trailers.  And it's just wild to see it with an audience.  I mean, go with a group of friends and watch this movie because it's just, it's like a  rock concert.  People just go nuts because the movies are really short and it's just one hit after another  and people are just screaming.  Yeah.  That's what I hear, everybody.  I can't wait to see it, man.  Absolutely.  It's over three hours.  It's just over three hours.  Yeah.  With credits. 
[01:14:30]  And we all get, what's funny is it doesn't feel that way because both movies are short.  So you forget that you even saw the first movie.  And after the second one, people are, every time we had a premiere screening, they go, we wish  you had double screenings because we just want to go right back in and experience it  again.  See it again.  Yeah.  It's like that, the phenomenon of watching your discs.  Yeah.  You know, once you put them in and you start watching, you just want to keep going.  The guys behind the scenes here, they all went already to see Grindhouse and huge thumbs  up on the staff of the Opie and Anthony show.  So our audience is going to love, love it.  And you direct the first one, Planet Terror. 
[01:15:00]  Planet Terror.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is there any connection between the two at all?  Any bleed in at all between the first and second feature?  There's supposed to be two completely different movies, but we ended up in grand fashion of  some of these double features.  Like sometimes you'd go see a Pam Grier double feature and she'd be in both movies, like  The Warden in one.  Right.  If it's a women in prison movie, she'd be a prisoner in the next one, even though they're  completely different movies.  Rose McGowan's in both.  A few characters are in both movies.  We're obsessed with prison films.  Yeah.  They're hot.  Yeah.  Female prison films.  The old ones, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  The old school ones.  You're going to like this movie.  This is almost like a zombie movie, but then around midway through, it turns into a women  in cages movie for a bit.  Really?  Oh, about 20 minutes.  It goes into a different subgenre.  How great was it watching Linda Blair be held down?  What a naughty little convict she was.  Isn't that lovely?  That's right.  She was taught a lesson.  Oh, those were the best.  Laura Gemzer, who also played Black Emmanuel, used to do a couple of those two women prison films  and really got me through my 14 through 18 years Cinemax, three in the morning, bag-whacking. 
[01:16:00]  Lovely.  That's what's cool about those movies.  People think that they're just exploitative to women.  Actually, they're empowering pictures.  That's what we do in these, too.  I think women really love these movies because of the empowerment and the women really take  over the movie after a while.  I've got to talk to you a little bit about Dusk Till Dawn.  Oh, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Loved it.  I remember I went into a blockbuster.  It was when we were up in Boston, and I used to watch a lot of videos before we had  to be there.  We were doing afternoon drive.  It was the bomb.  You didn't have to wake up, stay up as late as you want, out all night. 
[01:16:30]  Who can't be to work by 3 p.m.?  Right.  It was one of those deals.  I watched videos beforehand, so I went there, and I picked that up.  It looked interesting.  I knew nothing about it.  The girl at the counter says, have you seen this?  She goes, did you look at the back of the box or anything?  I said, no.  She goes, good.  Just watch it.  Don't look at anything.  I'm like, okay.  What the hell were you guys thinking?  Did you think people are going to like this or that it's weird, that it goes from this  really cool ... That movie could have just been about these two criminals. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  And we used to say the best way ... We said, it's too bad that people are seeing it in theaters  right now, because the trailer gives away that it's vampires.  Yeah.  The best way to see this movie is later when someone's watching it on cable or on tape,  and they pop it in, and they know nothing about it.  That's how I saw it.  It was like, what the hell is going ... It's a vampire movie?  You're like, what am I drinking?  Yeah.  What happened?  It was a crime movie, and it turns into a vampire movie.  What's funny about that is the script was like that, until you'd be reading, and you'd 
[01:17:30]  turn the page and go, wait, what happened?  Did they mix up the scripts here?  That was his first script, and he couldn't get it made for years, because people would  say, this is all wrong.  It's a Desperate Hours type movie in the first half, and vampires ... It makes no sense.  Get out of here.  And then Pulp Fiction hit, and suddenly they were like, this is great.  It's like two movies in one.  Yeah.  And we were able to go make it off the success of Pulp Fiction.  Some tell me that that was the closest thing you're going to catch to Tarantino's personality,  too, was the way he was, and from dusk till dawn, just a psychopath.  That really, I think, grabbed him.  Where he's hearing the voices that aren't there in his head. 
[01:18:00]  He wasn't really acting, was he?  That's him.  He actually came in with that character.  Oh, he was acting, and he was terrific.  He was just really great to direct.  And you know, it was a big surprise to me.  I was a big Pee-wee Herman fan watching the old HBO special of his Pee-wee's Playhouse  type thing, where it was a little more risque than his television show.  And there was a character on there named Hammy, who used to put shoe mirrors on and look up  girls' skirts.  And it turned out to be the guy that was in the band at the Titi Twister. 
[01:18:30]  That was my friend Tito Lariva, yeah.  Yeah, who's really turned into a really good musician, I gather.  Oh, he's an amazing musician.  He was a musician first.  Because that song, I love listening to that song that's playing when, what's her name,  comes out and starts dancing on the table.  I do one of the fake trailers in Grindhouse, where Danny Trejo's the star.  Oh, yeah.  Machete.  And Cheech Marin's in it, and that guy Tito's in it. 
[01:19:00]  So you'll get a little throwback to the Dusk Till Dawn.  Yeah, Danny turns up in everything.  He does.  But it was great to hear people just go ape for him, being the star of his own fake  movie.  That's awesome.  He gets the women, and he kills the bad guy.  What do you think is the best directed film I've ever seen?  The best directed film?  Yeah.  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  Okay.  So you're like, oh, I love that movie.  That was the, and back at the time, it was just kind of ignored.  Stuff really holds up.  Yeah, it holds up.  You know, you watch that.  Some of the shooting scenes are fantastic. 
[01:19:30]  Like, people not just doing that, grab their heart and fall down or something like that.  It's the, you know, you feel the power of it.  The guy spins around and hits the ground, which I just thought was great on those old  movies.  I think he was the first guy to shoot, actually, like, in one frame, like, while both people  were on camera without cutting.  Like, I think he was the first guy to actually show us shooting while we were both in the  same frame.  Really?  And show you get shot.  Yeah.  I think he was the first guy to do that.  Boring fact.  Good. 
[01:20:00]  And, of course, one of these things, it's an urban legend about you.  I don't know if it's true or not, but the wheelchair dolly.  Oh, no, absolutely.  You used to use a wheelchair for a dolly.  You used to actually have a cameraman in a wheelchair.  I was the cameraman.  You were the cameraman, of course.  I had one of the other actors push me, and it was in Mexico when I shot El Mariachi.  There was a little hospital right there next to my friend's house, so we went and borrowed  their one wheelchair, and we'd go down, push down the street, and it would be cool because  I would be looking up at the actors because I was sitting, and it would give real heroic 
[01:20:30]  type shots.  And during one of those shots, the guy runs out from the hospital and said, oh, we have  a patient coming in.  We need the wheelchair back.  Take your dolly away.  One wheelchair to have.  Good place to get surgery.  All right.  One knife, guy spitting on it, putting it on his shoulder.  Hey, what's the deal with the medical experiments back in the day?  Well, that's how I funded my...  Yeah, I was reading up on you, and I guess he...  To raise money, you'd let them experiment with your body a little bit.  Experiment on me, yeah.  We've done shows on this, and they'll call like crazy, like, yeah, I tried this new drug 
[01:21:00]  for schizophrenia or whatever, but...  Well, every drug that comes out has to go through an extensive...  But some of these are really risky, because we read an article, and you can get a lot of  money, because some of them, you know, they need people, but it's more risky.  Yeah, the riskier, the more money you make.  So they get the drunk college kids and like...  Well, no, totally.  I mean, Austin, Texas is the biggest college town, so they have a big place there called  Pharmaco, or at least they used to when I was there.  And they would just draw people in by the, you know, by the thousands that needed money. 
[01:21:30]  And I know I had two jobs just for tuition in my apartment, so if I wanted to make a  movie, I had to go make a score like that, where I was stuck in there for a month and  make $3,000 or whatever.  The worst one was, I was really excited, because it was a seven-day study, and you got  $2,000.  I was like, wow, $2,000 for seven days?  Nice.  I wonder what they'd do to you.  I need it.  So you go in there, and you sign up, and then they tell you what it is, and they say, it's  a speed healer drug.  You know, how do you test it?  Oh, no.  They wound you.  And you're listening to this, that they're going to take two butt punch biopsies out of 
[01:22:00]  the back of your arm, you know, put speed healer on one, placebo on the other, then  cut away that section of the arm, sew you back up.  And you're like, uh, it doesn't sound very good, but mentally, we already spent that  money, and you're kind of like, oh, I hate, that sounds, well, I guess it's just a small  hole, but then you have two identical scars on the back of your arm, which looks really  stupid when you're on the beach.  Yeah, what the hell happened after that?  Every once in a while, I run into people in town in Austin that have the same scars, and  I was like, it's like the brotherhood. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, remember me?  Remember that time?  Damn, that's horrible.  It was, but then you took the money, and I bought like a video camera, went and shot movies,  and it worked out for you.  Yeah, it worked out good.  What did a mariachi cost you?  That was seven grand.  Seven grand.  People thought that was like so cheap, and I thought, man, you have seven grand, you can  lend me that's a lot of money.  You're in college, it's a lot of money.  Yeah.  Were you surprised, though, that that storyline was able to launch you into a feature film?  Well, yeah, the plan, I had a really good plan.  I thought, I'm going to go make three low-budget Mexican action movies in Spanish, and just put 
[01:23:00]  them in the Spanish section.  No one will even know it's me, and just sell them to a Spanish video, that's why it's in  Spanish, and get my practice that way.  I'll be the whole crew, I'll learn how to do photography, lighting, and I'll make like  three of them to really get better, and then I'll go with the money from that, make  my first American independent film.  But the first mariachi movie ended up being released by Columbia Pictures, and that was  my practice.  How did that happen?  That's awesome.  I sent it to an agent to see what he thought of me making three of those, and he said, 
[01:23:30]  well, this is great, let me send it as an example to the studios.  And then they bought it, and decided to remake it.  But then, when they looked at it closer, they said, well, let's send this to film festivals.  And it ended up winning Sundance, and winning festivals, and people really got inspired by  the fact that I made it so inexpensively.  And that's what started this whole revolution of independent filmmakers making really low-budget  movies themselves.  The film is called Grindhouse, and I love what they gave you guys on the cover of Entertainment  Weekly.  One double feature, two wild directors, three bloody hours. 
[01:24:00]  They just gave you guys a really nice...  Well, there hasn't been a film made like this.  Never, yeah.  I mean, I hope everyone understands it's going to be quite the experience in the theater.  What really is cool is that when you sit there, that's what you feel.  It's like, I've never seen anything.  It's like a cinema circus, because there's so much going on.  Different filmmakers contributing to the trailers.  You've got Rob Zombie.  Yeah, Rob Zombie.  He did one of the fake trailers.  Eli Roth.  Right?  Eli Roth score?  Yeah, myself.  I did one.  And I think people are just going to feel ripped off now when they go to a regular movie,  and they just see one picture with commercials in front of it. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  This is just so, so cool.  I got to tell you, everyone finds a reviewer they respect, and the guy I respect is Kevin  Smith.  He's on our show a lot.  His quote is simple.  Kevin Smith's thoughts on Grindhouse.  Effing loved it.  Effing fantastic.  So insanely good.  Three hours long, but he would have sat through it again.  And they offered to rerun it right away.  See it as soon as you can.  That's from Kevin Smith, and a guy we definitely, we talk movies with from time to time and respect. 
[01:25:00]  Is it out yet?  Friday.  Oh, it did come out Friday, or it is?  This coming Friday.  This coming Friday.  Okay, so it's coming out this Friday.  I imagine it's opening all over the country.  Yeah.  I'm going today.  I'm going to one of the...  The screen?  Yeah, I'm going today.  It'd be great.  It's 6 o'clock if you want to go, Jimmy.  Either that, or I've got plans to stalk Black Sabbath at XM.  So if I'm out there, somebody's thrown out by their people, I'll go see if...  If not, I'll wait until Friday.  Yeah, if you go Friday, it'll be the hardcore crowd always going on Friday.  That's going to be sick.  That's going to be unbelievable.  That's a movie to see in the theater with a lot of people. 
[01:25:30]  It is.  It just turns into a rock concert.  Yeah.  It really does.  A lot of experience, definitely.  Quentin would call me the next morning after each screening like that and go, did that  really happen?  He just kept thinking it didn't happen.  He didn't know how we're going to top this now.  We got him tomorrow.  Oh, he's going to tell you how exciting it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got any dirt on him?  Dirt on Quentin?  Yeah, give us a little something we can hit him with.  Nothing.  Nothing on Quentin.  I was reading up on him.  I've only known him 14 years.  Over the weekend.  And he was talking about his movie nights at his house.  That's got to be just one of the most amazing things to be part of. 
[01:26:00]  Well, that was why I sort of wanted to make this movie.  You go to his house and he shows a double feature and puts trailers in between and it's  so much fun.  You just go, man, this is so much better than a scene movie in a regular theater.  We got to recreate this experience for the people around the world.  And that's where it began.  And that's where it began, yeah.  And it's not the films like, you know, oh, let's see Caddyshack and Animal House.  It's like black exploitation films, prison flicks, kung fu, all that stuff. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  All the bad B movies.  Oh, the other thing about Grindhouse really fast.  The ratings board gave you a little problem.  No, they didn't.  But in the end, you guys walked out of that meeting kind of happy that they didn't cut  it too bad.  Yeah, no, it was a rumor that they hadn't even seen it yet.  And we actually were a little disappointed they didn't give us that much trouble.  Oh, really?  No, they totally got it.  The tone of the movie is one that's not, you know, people don't really know sometimes  what Grindhouse means.  They just think it's a house where people go in and get grinded up.  Right.  It's like, no, it's a reference to the old theaters.  But no, it wasn't bad at all. 
[01:27:00]  Okay.  It gave us no trouble.  I heard about a trampoline scene.  Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to see.  Oh, no, you see that?  Oh, no, it's there.  It's there, they just cut it a little bit?  All right, they just put some scratches.  It hadn't been aged yet, because the movie looks like it's been aged.  Yeah, that's what they did too.  They scratched up the film a little bit, make it feel like it was made a while ago.  And some scenes just end, and it says, scene missing or something like that?  Missing.  There's sometimes a whole section missing.  And when you come back, half the people are dead.  The person's left with that person.  It really plays with that whole life.  People just go crazy for that. 
[01:27:30]  They love it.  And you totally can pick up where it left.  And I have a feeling you guys have a hell of a DVD on your hands.  A hell of a DVD is coming.  I can only imagine, but the movie itself is going to be great.  The reviews so far are unbelievable.  Robert Rodriguez from Grindhouse.  Thank you very much, man.  Absolutely.  He directs the first film, Planet Terror, that you're going to see coming Friday.  And Friday, Tarantino directs the second one.  It stars Kurt Russell, Rose McGowan.  It's just an amazing film.  Everyone has raved about it, and it premieres this Friday all over the country.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  So go see it.  All right.  Psyched.  And we'll continue in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right on, right on, right on.  Robert Rodriguez.  Very cool guy, man.  He's a sweet man.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Make sure you check out Grindhouse this Friday. 
[01:28:30]  I'm going tonight.  I can't wait.  I haven't been excited about a movie in a long time.  Actually, I was talking to my mom, and we talk about movies.  Yeah.  She goes, and she always asks me, have you seen any good movies lately?  And I'm sitting there thinking.  I'm like, you know what?  No.  I can't remember the last good movie I went to.  I, uh.  In a theater.  I can't remember.  I just saw 300.  How was it?  I loved it.  I thought it was great. 
[01:29:00]  Just amazing battle scenes.  People are, eh, people get all picky.  Yeah, half the movie's in slow motion.  Good.  People were bitching about Gladiator.  When Gladiator came out, they were bitching like, ah, I didn't like the way Ridley Scott  did the fight scenes because they were too blurry and too, like, the shaky cam as they  were fighting and stuff like that.  Because they weren't used to filmmaking like that.  That's what made that so cool.  I don't think anyone did that before where it was all close-ups and it just made you  feel like it was a real fight. 
[01:29:30]  300 was so cool.  Like, they'd be in normal motion and then slow motion shot of someone just hacking someone's  leg off.  Yeah.  Blood squirting out in slow motion.  And really, uh, cool movie.  And just, you know, those epic battles and...  But in general, people are loving 300, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Because you said people were bitching.  Yeah, some people are just like, eh, meh, meh.  How about, uh, Blades of Glory?  It was great.  Uh, I've not seen that yet.  Ugh. 
[01:30:00]  I, uh...  Ugh.  Ugh.  I shan't be seeing that.  Oh, no.  What's that?  No good?  I don't know.  It doesn't look good.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I mean, that's not fair.  We hate when people do that to us, but it doesn't look good.  Yeah, I'm...  I guess I should see it and then make my opinion, but...  I'm kind of tired of that act.  They gotta start making comedies like they used to.  It's the same crap.  With balls, you mean?  Like some kind of ball?  With balls, right.  The PC police have ruined comedies, I believe, for the most part. 
[01:30:30]  I think it's almost time for Will Ferrell to start pulling that comedian goes a little  serious thing.  He tried that.  I think it's time.  Did he?  In what?  What was that movie, oh my god, we rented it, and an hour and 15 minutes in, I was watching  it with the Philly crew, and a room full of people, hour and a half in, hour and 15  minutes in, we finally were brave enough to all gonna...  Oh, thank you.  Stranger Than Fiction.  We're all brave enough to go, uh, does anyone else think this movie's going nowhere and sucks? 
[01:31:00]  You know how you're like...  We've all been there, you know?  You're sitting and you're watching this movie and you're committing to it, and it starts  off slow, but you're like, ah, maybe it's just kind of revving up, and it's gonna get  to a point eventually.  Hour and 15 minutes in, we finally realized, oh my god, this movie blows.  Really bad?  Yeah, but you kept hoping and hoping and hoping it was going somewhere, and it just never  went anywhere, and we gave up on it. 
[01:31:30]  Well, the comedy, the comedians, uh, comedy actors doing that, when they go serious, it  kind of takes them a couple of movies to get up to speed.  It was brutal, and then we finally said, screw this, and then we're like, what else did we  get from Blockbuster?  We got Murderball, which is an amazing documentary, if you haven't seen it yet, and we threw that  in.  What you're saying is, it was no Spanglish.  Yeah.  Spanglish.  Hey, look, Robin Williams was a Juilliard-trained actor.  He does great serious films.  Sometimes they're better than the comedy.  Yeah, yeah.  There we go.  Awakenings, and you know, Deadpool.  I like his serious movies way better than his comedies. 
[01:32:00]  I don't like his comedies.  I really don't.  Well, Garf was good.  I mean, he's got some funny ones.  Garf was amazing.  Yeah, Mrs. Doubtfire was funny, but he kind of, you know, put him in a woman's suit, whatever.  But I mean, his serious movies are great.  I saw a movie over the weekend also that I just popped it on because nothing else was on.  It was a really good movie.  The Assassination of Richard Nixon.  It's Sean Penn playing a guy that just loses his mind because his life sucks so bad. 
[01:32:30]  He plays such a great, pathetic loser who's just got a failed marriage, a horrid job with horrid bosses,  and he wants to make a mark on his life, you know, make a mark in society.  So out of this crazed, delusional mind, he decides he's going to try to assassinate Richard Nixon  because he's like this focal point of his frustration with life. 
[01:33:00]  And I've never seen Sean Penn do a better job at, or anybody do a better job at playing a pathetic, sad sack.  The guy was really good.  So if you get a chance to see it, I think it's on HBO this month.  When did it come out?  2005, maybe.  Okay.  Somewhere around there.  And I hate Sean Penn, but I think he's a really good actor.  We've got to be fair, Michael and Harrisburg, Blades of Glory, 69% good ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. 
[01:33:30]  I respect Rotten Tomatoes because they take all the main reviews from all the papers across America  and give you one review.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, the papers even in New York are schizo.  A movie will get one star, and the next paper will give it four.  So Rotten Tomatoes gives you a nice average score.  Kind of averages it out for you.  And 69% means it's a fresh tomato, which means most critics like the movie.  Over, I guess, 50, they give it a fresh rating.  A fresh tomato.  Let's say hi to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I saw 300 on Friday. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Really looking forward to it.  The cinematography was brilliant.  I mean, it couldn't look any better, but it was supposed to be based on a realistic battle,  and there's goblins and ogres in it.  It totally screwed it up for me.  Well, they kind of threw in.  They didn't throw in a lot of that stuff, and I think they didn't throw in goblins and ogres  more than, like, really physically deformed people.  Very exaggerated, but it wasn't like they were monsters.  Like, that stupid little hunchback thingy, that could have been some diseased guy from 
[01:34:30]  way back when.  You know, way over the top, but...  They were monsters, though, because there was, like, this Jabba the Hutt guy with these,  like, axe arms that, like, decapitated the generals.  Oh, yeah, yeah, that guy.  He was kind of cool executioner, big fat guy.  Hey, Cigars, where do you live again?  Middletown, New Jersey.  You want to take the trip out to Long Island to see Bob Saget?  What day?  It's going to be April 20th. 
[01:35:00]  It's a Friday.  Yeah, it sounds good.  I'm just offering you a pair of tickets.  It's the North Fork Theater in Westbury, Friday, April 20th, Bob Saget.  Yeah, that rocks.  I think a bunch of us are going, so why don't you hold on the line, we'll give you a pair  of tickets, all right?  Thank you, absolutely.  All right, cool.  Cigars and Scotch, he does a lot of great things.  He's throwing in a good phone call, he does great photoshops, he does good.  He does amazing stuff for the show, amazing stuff.  You know what I saw, I was watching TV and they were talking about, I forgot the name  of the movie, and Anne saw it too, Children. 
[01:35:30]  It's on DVD now.  Oh, right.  The Children of Men.  And they said, you know, every once in a while there's a movie that hits theaters and  no one gives a crap about for whatever reason, and then it hits DVD and people are like,  you've really got to freaking rent, Children of Men, they're saying.  That it should have gotten a lot more attention in the theaters than it did.  But you saw and you were like, you had mixed reviews, right?  When I saw the trailer, I was all psyched, I thought it looked like a great idea.  I love anything that's kind of post-apocalyptic, I kind of like that idea. 
[01:36:00]  It was mankind pretty much doomed because no one was having kids.  And then this African woman is pregnant, and they're taking her somewhere.  Explained to me where, I had no clue, there's a war going on, I have no clue.  At the end of the movie, I have no clue.  It got 91% reviews.  Well, that's fantastic.  On Rotten Tomatoes.  Thanks a lot.  Because those are critics.  I don't know what was going on in that movie. 
[01:36:30]  I don't know where anyone was going with this pregnant woman and the baby.  I have no idea.  That's where I was left.  The credits started rolling, and I was like, it's a blah, blah, blah.  Rewind.  What?  We missed a chapter.  This wasn't burnt properly.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the problem.  Oh.  Ixnay on the burnt properly.  I saw the queen.  How was the queen?  Very well acted.  Yeah, it was.  A little slow.  A little slow.  A little slow. 
[01:37:00]  I knew it was going to be slow.  But then again, I saw it on a plane, so.  It didn't matter.  How fast does it really have to go?  You weren't going anywhere.  Who cares?  There's a scene with her and Margaret Thatcher where they had, let's just say, something  with two ends that looked exactly the same, and, oh, the old butt cheeks were clapping  together.  I was laughing, high-fiving my girl.  She dozed off in my lap, which was really not what I wanted her to be doing there.  She just fell asleep.  That's slow, huh?  Oh, it was awful.  I was so irritated.  A little slow.  Good movie, though.  I mean, well acted, but, you know, all right, we get it. 
[01:37:30]  You're stoic.  You're stoic.  The queen is for queers.  Exactly.  I'm not watching that.  I have my limits.  Oh, by the way, people want me to give you a pair of tickets to see Bob Saget for your  terrific phone call with ManCal last week.  Oh, wow.  We forgot to give you the Bob Saget tickets for that fine phone call.  Thanks.  I don't think I'm going to be able to make it.  All right.  Well, anyway, we got Black Sabbath or Heaven and Hell.  Black Sabbath, you can call him.  That's what I call him.  Heaven and Hell.  Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy will make sense of the whole thing.  That's correct.  The ass kissing will commence in about 15 minutes.  I am going to be completely honest.  Oh, wow.  They were wonderful lives.  They were.  Dio didn't miss a note.  Oh, he's an amazing, amazing, vocalist, great voice.  I was clapping like a little girl.  Really?  He's clapping.  I look like a fat chick.  I'm just standing there clapping happily.  Disgusting my.  I'm sick.  Hey, we got an update on the Chocolate Jesus.  Remember, we were on to that story on, what, Friday? 
[01:38:30]  What's the deal?  There's a hotel here.  An artist decided to get some attention.  He made Chocolate Jesus.  Jesus made out of chocolate.  But the problem is he's nude.  He doesn't have a little chocolate loincloth on.  Oh, white chocolate.  That was the problem?  That was one of the biggest problems, is that he was nude.  I thought that he was made out of chocolate.  Made out of chocolate.  I don't think they really, I don't think the Catholics care what you make them out of,  as long as you're a show of respect.  When are the Catholics going to be outraged?  Unless you make them out of manure, then they don't like that either.  And I was brought up Catholic.  When are they going to be outraged that we kind of worship a bunny for Easter? 
[01:39:00]  They have no problem with that.  I think some hardcore people might have a problem with the bunny.  They don't really come out of the woodwork every year, though.  You know, you do the Chocolate Jesus.  There's an unbelievable outrage.  But, ah, let the kids worship a bunny every Easter.  Yeah, it's the...  I go on a, you know, an egg hunt.  An Easter egg hunt.  Are they going to do that in the White House?  I'm sure they will.  This year?  Mm-hmm.  Ah, by the way, six people dead over the weekend.  Ah, great. 
[01:39:30]  Have a little Easter egg hunt at the White House.  It's amazing how they're offended that you're showing a penis.  It's like, it's, it's not, it's not a sexual thing.  It's just a naked guy.  What's the problem?  People are so offended by the human body here in this country that it's, it's offensive how  offended people are.  Uh, they have, Jesus, he was supposed to be hanging up, uh, in a hotel lobby, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And the hotel finally caved in and said, no, we're getting bad press.  But then the artist said he's getting a lot of, um, a lot of, uh, offers to have it displayed  in other places. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know, gay bars, perhaps.  Let's display it here for a day.  Uh, I'd love to.  Get the artist on the phone.  I would love to.  I know what the problem is, by the way.  They said that the fact that it was made out of chocolate, and they saw the version of  white chocolate, and the penis was smaller.  It was smaller, yeah.  Can we, can we get it displayed here?  Or, or is the company going to freak out?  Uh, they would freak out.  I say, I say we have the, well, then we do it over at the other joint.  Sure.  We display it for a day, and then we'll let the listeners line up and check it out.  Get the artist on the phone, Steve. 
[01:40:30]  How we're going to keep Steve from eating the same part, uh, day after day.  The artist is going to have to come in with another tube of chocolate.  Slap it on.  You can try it any part.  Why that one?  It's so tasty.  It's not gay, because it's chocolate.  How many licks does it take to get to the center?  All right, hey, uh, so here's your update.  The controversial chocolate Jesus, now on the move since its bittersweet, 
[01:41:00]  removal from a Manhattan gallery.  The dark chocolate statue is now riding around in a refrigerated truck,  kept secret from the public.  The artist says offers to display,  My Sweet Lord, are coming in from around the world.  But he believes secrecy is essential to protect the statue from fanatics,  who, he says, are looking to destroy his art.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You can't destroy art.  Just make another one.  It's chocolate.  It's chocolate.  Lighten up.  It's like you're made out of gold flecks.  It's not hard to get more chocolate. 
[01:41:30]  Just make another one.  Have two.  Yeah.  We'll eat one.  Laugh.  Crack off an arm.  Yes.  Someday, someday we're just going to ignore these people,  the controversy, and just go forward and realize,  Oh, my God, they don't have any power.  Someday.  Oh, my God, they really can't do anything.  And then we'll have the freedom to do what we're free,  we're supposedly free to do in this country,  which is freedom of speech,  freedom to offend people. 
[01:42:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Apparently, these people,  for some reason, people think they have power.  Yeah.  When they open their yaps, they go,  Okay, we're sorry.  Oh, my God, don't do what you're going to do,  even though we don't know what it is.  We know you have a lot of power to do things,  evil things, horrible things.  Jimmy's been just writing, like, Black Sabbath questions all morning.  I have a couple.  I'm just nervous.  Oh, nice.  Are you all nervous?  Yeah, a little bit.  Very psyched.  You came in very happy today, Jimmy.  I was, I was.  I guess we need to have Black Sabbath in every day. 
[01:42:30]  He was like, tra-la-la-la-la-la-la.  He came in all happy and said hi to everybody,  and he was light on his feet.  I'm like, damn, you know what?  We've got to book Black Sabbath every day to get the happy Jimmy.  I traipsed in here.  I was just.  A little early, by the way.  I couldn't help it.  I was up at the.  What the hell?  Oh, was it like trying to sleep on Christmas?  Yeah, it was.  Christmas Eve.  I kept having nightmares that I was.  I had some really weird dream that I was being beaten up,  and then I overslept.  It was just awful.  Aw.  I overslept.  Did Black Sabbath cuddle you and make you feel better? 
[01:43:00]  No, it wasn't homoerotic.  Oh, okay.  Not this time, Eddie.  I'm sorry about that.  Do we care about Bellows' bike?  Stupid Bellows.  Do we care?  Oh, it's just idiot news today we're playing.  Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Barley Circus.  Ringling Brothers.  Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Barley.  Barnum and Barley.  Trying to say that fast.  Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Barley.  That dopey clown with the pin hair.  He's got like almost a mohawk, but I don't know what it is. 
[01:43:30]  Spiky hair.  He lost his itty-bitty bike.  Oh, baby.  The world's smallest bicycle, which he rides around on under the big top.  Does he?  God, do I hate circuses.  They're awful.  Ike, you couldn't drag me to this primitive form of entertainment.  Oog.  It should have all just disasters of nature, like real freaks, while people just laugh and  you get like things to throw at them, like rotten fruit.  Yeah, rotten cabbage.  You just haul it at somebody with three ears. 
[01:44:00]  Wouldn't that be great?  As he goes, no!  That's a circus.  But they changed it into watching some stupid clown ride his little bicycle that he put  in a suitcase, and apparently, I don't know how, but he lost it.  Yeah.  And we have a new hero.  Remember the subway Superman, the guy that jumped on top of another guy that was having  a seizure and saved him from the subway train?  Wow, we have a new guy.  A new guy.  He's a homeless guy.  Of course he is.  A homeless guy found the bike. 
[01:44:30]  The itty-bitty bike.  The little bike that he rides around on.  Do you know when I go to the circus and I see the elephants traipsing around, happy and  regal?  You know what I think?  I'm going to go home and play the piano.  Right.  If I tickle those ivories, I would love to see them just go berserk and run over the  first row of children.  Oh, would that be great?  Catastrophe at the circus today.  I hate the circus.  They stink.  I remember being at the circus when I was a kid. 
[01:45:00]  Little kid.  And you know how those places like Madison Square Garden and stuff just as a kid were giant?  Like, when you walked in, it was the biggest place you'd ever seen in your life.  And we had the crappiest seats.  My father got us crap seats.  Because he was too busy drinking.  Drinking.  He drank away your ticket money.  Come on, Dad.  One less bottle of Jack one row forward.  Maybe we can move up a few sections.  Move up a few seats.  If you didn't drink away all the money that you should have spent on our tickets. 
[01:45:30]  It's our childhood.  I was sitting up in the nosebleeds.  And we're watching the stupid circus.  And all I could see were the elephants.  You sat with the poor people.  Yeah.  Everything else was too small.  So I saw the elephants.  And I wanted this light that was on a chain.  And you spun it around.  And it made like a circle of light.  So I wanted that.  And of course, I'm like, yeah.  Because I was a big crybaby.  But I wanted it.  So he finally bought it for me.  And I'm spinning it around.  And after like three revolutions, it hit the metal rail in front of me. 
[01:46:00]  And shattered into 800 pieces.  And you cried.  The circus stinks.  Yeah.  And I started crying again.  I want another one.  No.  Oh, I want another one.  I got to go to the bathroom.  I got to go to the bathroom.  I got to go to the bathroom.  You wanted another one.  You couldn't have it.  But I'm sure your dad had another one.  Another beer.  Why not?  Another beer for pops.  You should have given me one.  I might have shut up.  Anyway, do we care about Bellows' bike then? 
[01:46:30]  I guess a homeless guy found it.  And they gave him a whole thousand dollars.  You gave him a thousand bucks to a homeless guy?  What's he going to do with that?  Yeah, but they got away easy because they knew he was homeless.  Let's be honest here.  They also gave him a mountain bike.  They gave a homeless guy a mountain bike.  A 10-speed mountain bike.  Just something to be beaten for.  Exactly.  In three weeks.  See, that's what people don't understand.  They make fun of us because we do the homeless shopping spree, but we have educated ourselves  by doing that year after year.  And you can't give the homeless people stuff they can't hide. 
[01:47:00]  No, they need stuff they can hide.  We learned that the hard way.  And stuff they can wear under layers of crappy clothes.  Right, right.  As soon as you give a guy a brand new mountain bike and he's living on the streets here in  New York, that mountain bike is gone by tomorrow.  Yep.  You buy them nice sweaters and stuff like that, you got to let them keep their crappy overcoat  to wear over those sweaters so they don't get rolled for their sweaters.  Right.  See, it's easy.  All right.  So we don't need to play the audio.  There's your update. 
[01:47:30]  I guess not.  Well, the homeless guy finding it, he's going, I saw it.  I didn't know what it was.  All right.  Now.  You might want to.  Yeah.  You might want to hear it.  See, now you brought it.  See what we just did.  Now people need to hear the audio.  I just want to hear the homeless guy.  A clown is smiling today thanks to a good Samaritan.  Bello Knock has his famous bike back.  The star of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus.  Thank God we made the clown happy again.  Screw the homeless guy.  Doesn't the clown just suck?  Look, I don't care about homeless people in general, but we do suck. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Thank God the clown is smiling again.  The clown is smiling.  First of all.  Thanks to this homeless guy that will be on the streets after this story is over.  Doesn't the clown just put smiley makeup on and he's smiling?  Right.  Does it matter really if he's smiling or not?  I say no.  Look how we just ignore the homeless guy.  Yeah.  It's just a dredge.  Thank God the clown is smiling again.  Barnum and Bailey Circus accidentally left his 12-inch bike outside Grand Central Terminal Friday. 
[01:48:30]  It's probably the thing that I'm most famous for because I have used it everywhere and anywhere I've gone.  Meanwhile, Ricky Robinson saw the bike lying on the street.  Whoa, what this?  A curious contraption.  I didn't know what it was.  Everything was working, but I didn't know how anybody ride it.  You know, that's not the question.  I guarantee they got some great quotes from this guy.  Oh, yeah.  We can't play it down in the news.  Like, I thought it was a cell phone.  I thought it was a crack pipe. 
[01:49:00]  I was sucking on a handlebar and trying to light the pedal.  Right.  You know that was, you know.  I didn't know what it was.  I thought if you poured water on it, it would turn into a big bike.  A big bike.  I didn't understand.  Right.  After seeing the story about Bellow's missing bike, Mr. Robinson brought it to the garden.  In return for his kindness, he gets a $1,000 reward, a new bicycle, and tickets to a Knicks game. 
[01:49:30]  But Bellow and Robinson agree the circus audience will also get a big reward.  You are going to help me make a lot of kids very, very happy.  That's good.  That's good.  Well, I like kids to be happy.  I like kids to be happy.  That's good, but why don't you make me happy?  Why can't I go to the circus?  Who are you?  Who are you?  And what is this thing?  This ain't no bicycle.  All right.  We're in a speed round because Jimmy's panicking. 
[01:50:00]  We got Black Sabbath here.  I just got to play this really fast thing.  Everyone's talking about it today.  The newscaster in Salt Lake City.  He gets caught sleeping during the weather forecast.  It's a quickie, and then we'll take a break, and we'll get Black Sabbath in here with Ronnie James Dio.  Yes.  But this happened in Salt Lake City.  Yeah.  But there's something out there.  Wait, I don't know what happened.  Let's try that again.  Doesn't look like much, but there's something out there.  Oh, hello, Mike. 
[01:50:30]  We got him sleeping.  You know what?  That was a great weather forecast, wasn't it?  John kind of has that effect.  That was really good.  I had that effect on him.  Who's directing?  Oh, Doc, you okay?  You okay?  You're supposed to tell us in our ears when it's time to wake up.  That was cute.  Usually I hear the five-day forecast, and then I snap out of it.  It's a seven-day.  But he was in deep rim during the seven-day forecast. 
[01:51:00]  That's a power nap.  I feel great now.  I know you do.  I feel awesome.  Mike's ready to tumble.  Let's do that.  You are not napping.  He was napping.  That is excellent.  You know why?  We all do it.  Yes, we do.  I know.  I listen intently to the news in my ear.  That is good stuff.  All right, obviously this makes for a much better video than an audio bit.  What's the deal?  The weather guy falling asleep.  Oh, yeah.  They cut away, and they were doing whatever topic they were on,  and then they come back to the news desk. 
[01:51:30]  It's like a wide shot, so you see all four of the guys.  And the guy on the end, he's just out kind of with his back into the chair,  and they kind of have to wake him up.  You hear him kind of go, huh, huh, huh.  Yeah, and he's trying to play it off like it's fun, and, oh, I was just goofing around.  But, I mean, he was just busted.  He was just busted.  It's on YouTube?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, it's everywhere.  All right, we got a break.  We got Black Sabbath coming in next.  Jimmy's going to interview his heroes.  He loves this.  I certainly do. 
[01:52:00]  He can't wait.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There are whispers between the screens  That this deed can be done  Even sinners must scream  And I can be the one  To make the devil cry  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:52:30]  That voice just gives me chills there, Ronnie.  Ronnie James Dio.  We got Black Sabbath, Heaven and Hell.  Black Sabbath slash Heaven and Hell in studio.  Ronnie, Vinny Apice, Tony Iommi.  He's a butler.  I could not be happier that you guys came in today.  I felt for sure he was going to say something else.  That song gives me something else.  Yeah, it does.  Believe me.  It won't be easy, but...  I'm glad you guys got up.  I mean, I know that you and Tony were like 
[01:53:00]  Getting up kind of sucks in the morning  And I'm glad you guys made it in.  Why should these guys have to get up early?  They've earned the right to wake up at 3 in the afternoon  If they want.  That's what we said.  Exactly.  See ya.  Walk around.  Did you go to bed last night?  Do ya?  How about turning that mic on?  There we go.  We don't have your mic on for some reason.  There it is.  Now it's on.  Is it on?  Yes, I think so.  It's on.  Yep.  All right.  All right, good.  Usually four mics, one gets screwed up.  I think you're okay.  Yeah, four is...  We can't even comprehend four mics. 
[01:53:30]  I went to the show on Friday night  And man, were you guys fantastic.  You, dude, you don't miss a note.  I got the chills when you were doing Heaven and Hell.  It was just amazing.  Thank you.  You didn't miss a note.  You were fantastic.  He said that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I heard a British voice.  I kind of knew to look in that direction.  I missed three notes.  Ah, you missed three, huh?  Ronnie, what do you do for your voice  That keeps it...  Because there are a lot of guys that, you know,  If you're talking through the 70s, the 80s, 90s, 
[01:54:00]  Guys that have just blown their voices out,  Especially that sing with the intensity you do.  What...  Is it luck?  Is it something you do?  I guess some of it's probably luck.  I would imagine most of it is technique.  If you know what you're doing, you know,  You can deal with it.  Because a lot of people wouldn't think of you  As somebody that actually thinks of technique with singing.  They're thinking you just balls out, you know,  Singing, and you are using the proper technique  So you can keep singing over the years.  Absolutely, you have to. 
[01:54:30]  I mean, you just blow yourself away  By just screaming and shouting from up here.  You know, see, everything comes from the diaphragm.  It's all technique.  There's nothing sadder than seeing a band  Whose singer is well past their prime  And hasn't taken care of their voice  And can hit those notes.  So it's so...  It's just so cool to...  Getting some chuckles.  Getting some chuckles from the band.  And not saying anything.  But there's a few chuckles.  Yeah, you can't see the band.  They just kind of, like, look at each other  And a little chuckle. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, a couple of chuckles.  No, Ronnie James, man.  You kick ass.  Absolutely.  The voice is right there.  It's amazing to listen to.  Thank you, Anse.  How is it being on stage without obviously?  Hey, Anse.  How is it being on stage without Ozzy?  I mean...  Oh, it's the sign for Ron, right?  And what, did they play Radio City?  Yeah, it was amazing.  And Eddie Trunk, I went to see him at Eddie Trunk's show.  And at the end of it, he thanked everybody for being in the studio.  And he goes, I want to thank Jim Norton for looking like a stalker. 
[01:55:30]  I just stood there.  I really am like Hinkley.  I just stand there and look at these poor guys.  They're trying to talk.  And I'm just creepy.  You are frightening.  You guys do understand he's your number one fan, right?  I mean, I'm not even kidding.  There's no one that is a bigger fan than Jim Norton as far as Black Sabbath goes.  And I wish you guys were coming every day because we get the happy Jimmy.  He's skipping around the joint.  He's got all sorts of memorabilia and bad pictures.  No, I know.  He's usually a miserable sot.  He usually sucks.  But today, he's all happy. 
[01:56:00]  He's saying good morning to everybody.  He was in the front at the Hall of Fame as well.  I don't know if that mic's on.  Is that mic on?  I don't know.  He's totally just sitting there.  I was in the front at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I got pictures.  I hijacked the press conference.  This stupid press is trying to ask, when's the next album coming out?  And I'm up in the front row.  And they're like, sir, could you sit down?  I'm like, just die already.  I must have asked 20 questions.  And it was fan questions.  I wanted to answer fan questions.  I didn't want the same corny questions because the press kind of douched him for all those  years.  So it was nice to be able to ask fan questions for, you know.  Jimmy felt like he was asking.  He wanted to outdo the press and everybody else with his Black Sabbath prowess, his knowledge 
[01:56:30]  of Black Sabbath.  And I think it made him come off like a complete stalker.  The first time I met Tony and Giza, they were doing a signing in Philadelphia.  And I got a little overanxious.  As soon as I got off the bus, I'm over there with a camera.  Oh, the worst thing you could do, unless you're a chick.  And I know exactly.  If I was a chick, it would have been like, come on.  Their manager's like, all right, just wait a minute.  And then I'm trying to talk to Tony.  She's walking by.  I'm like, yeah, but I'll be interviewing you next week.  Yeah, next time.  This is like a year ago.  And he goes, okay, great.  And then a minute later, I'm in front of him with a camera. 
[01:57:00]  And he goes, oh, you again.  I creeped him out the first time.  How are the fans taking you guys?  Are they really digging it?  Yeah.  Absolutely, yeah.  It's been really surprising to us, I think, you know, that there's been this much attention  given to us.  I mean, just the band.  You know, selling Radio City out so quickly was probably, you know, that was the forward to  all of this, really.  And everything else kind of followed through as well.  There aren't many bands that can go out with two completely different singers and still 
[01:57:30]  attract huge crowds.  It's their fault.  It's all you guys.  Yeah.  It's all your fault.  It's incredible how young the kids are as well that come to the show.  Yeah.  Well, they're also, it's weird because I was driving through town and I went right past  Radio City and you see kids and they're with their parents.  Yeah.  And the parents look like degenerates.  These guys are all like, they got like, they're completely bald.  They might have a little rat tail in the back. 
[01:58:00]  And then their kids are just kind of strutting around.  I thought I saw you crossing the street.  But then they got their kids with them, you know, and their kids are digging it.  Maybe we can do diapers on the next video.  Diapers.  Actually.  Is that my gun?  You know.  Actually, we have a, we have a merchandise thing that, you know, in the Dio band and they're  called Holy Diapers.  Holy Diapers.  Did he leak?  Probably.  And I was, I was amazed talking to these guys too, because you have the same problems 
[01:58:30]  that we do, like we do a traveling virus, we do a comedy tour, and you were saying that  you weren't happy, Tony, with the sound check, because you guys didn't get to really complete  the sound check.  What happened with that?  Like you go in there to play and.  Well, we were hanging around for ages and then eventually we were allowed to go on stage.  That mic's not on.  Oh, it's kind of on.  No, it's on.  It's just echoey.  No, it's, no.  Is this one on?  The other mic is picking him up.  Okay.  There we go.  Thanks.  We, uh, you see, that's not on either.  That's not on either. 
[01:59:00]  Keep screwing with him.  There you go.  I'll use this.  All right.  Um, and, uh.  What's off again?  We got on stage and it lasted a couple of minutes and then we had to stop.  So basically we didn't have a sound check and we had no money, proper money to check  or anything.  And because we were filming that, it was really important as well that we got a sound check.  But how the hell did you not get to do a sound check?  It's called unions.  Unions.  Unions.  That's what it's called.  We had this voice from the speaker, stop, stop, stop.  And that was it.  Everybody off the stage.  Everybody off the stage. 
[01:59:30]  Are you kidding me?  Black Sabbath wants to warm up and they're filming a DVD and this stupid union has to  jump in.  In the middle of the song, too.  In the middle of the song?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's like...  Well, Tony put a curse on them so that...  Ah, good.  That'll stop them.  I know about the evilness.  It's gotta work.  It does.  What time did you guys have to wake up this morning?  We just stayed up all night long.  Did you drink?  Do you drink?  Are you a drinker?  Uh-huh.  Ronnie?  Ronnie goes, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Got anything?  Yeah, right?  What do we got?  I would love to have you guys loaded in the morning. 
[02:00:00]  Believe me.  This hour.  I passed that stupid opening day.  I was a Yankee fan like Ronnie is.  And they had opening day tickets behind the dugout.  And I said, do I want to go do that?  Or do I want to go stare at four men at XM later on?  And I passed up those stupid baseball tickets so I can go and watch you guys talk to Eddie  later.  I just don't want you to think I'm dangerous.  I have no weapons.  I'm a nice seller.  I'm going to the stadium.  Hell, you could take my plate.  How great would that be?  I was going to bring you a Mariano Rivera signed baseball, but I figured that'd be too  groveling and needy.  It would be.  And he probably knows Mariano.  I'm glad I didn't do it.  But way to mention what I almost did, which would have been nice for the band. 
[02:00:30]  The CD is called Black Sabbath, The Deal Years.  It's a lot of stuff with Ronnie.  And it's also three new songs, which are phenomenal.  I heard them.  The Devil Cried.  And there's one with Shadow in the title, which I don't remember.  Shadow of the Wind.  Shadow of the Way.  The Air in the Wall.  And can you tell me about the CD?  I'm really psyched you guys finally putting something out with you on it again.  Well, all of this started because they asked us if we had anything new, or old, new, the  things that hadn't been heard before. 
[02:01:00]  And we didn't.  We don't.  We just kind of write for the project so we don't keep things on the side.  If it wasn't good enough to be on the album, then we don't deal with it.  So, they asked if we would make this a bit more of a special presentation for the people  who are going to pay the money for this.  And would we write two songs?  So, we talked about it.  We agreed to do that.  And that was really what kick-started this whole project.  And as you can see, we wrote three songs instead of two because it just went so well.  Yeah.  Good, man.  The thing I was thinking about this morning is, like, Ozzy, you know, is out of Sabbath 
[02:01:30]  in, like, what, 79 or early 80, and everybody succeeded.  Like, I mean, Ozzy did really well on his own, and then you come in, and I think what  you did was harder because you had to replace a guy who was very well-loved, and you put  out Mob Rules, Heaven and Hell, and then again, Live Evil.  And were you nervous coming into that situation and replacing a guy who was so associated with  the band as a front man?  I'm never nervous about anything.  No, you don't care?  No.  Why the hell should he be?  Well, you know, because I don't consider myself to be him. 
[02:02:00]  I consider myself to be me.  Right.  I only have me to present to all this.  So, you know, you shouldn't be nervous about, you know, what you think you can do properly.  So, it was not a problem for me at all.  I mean, the worst part for me, I think, was the first, probably the first month of the  tour that we did in America because I thought that, you know, that the sign that I should  be using was this one because that's all we saw.  The middle finger?  Were they really, they were jamming their finger up at you?  It wasn't very nice.  Oh, wow.  You know, because once again, you know, when you're put in a position of having to replace 
[02:02:30]  someone who they did care about so much, you know, a lot of the adamant fans, you know,  saluted me with the middle finger a lot.  So, I just added the other finger to it.  So, then I created my own little thing, you know.  That is your thing.  People on radio can't see it, but it's the pinky and the pointer finger up like the devil  horn.  Get that thumb down.  Get that thumb down.  Oh, did I put the thumb wrong?  I'm just a nervous Nelly.  You're in Hawaii.  Mahalo.  Yeah, little faggity girl hands I have waving around.  Trying to do the devil horns.  I'm getting picked up by other men outside.  I really make myself sick. 
[02:03:00]  So, you guys have like a whole American tour hooked up.  I'm really happy that you guys came in today.  I'm really, you don't know how pleased I am.  And I know that you were concerned that you weren't going to make it in, but I'm really,  and Giza, you look sick.  Are you all right?  Can I get you anything?  I was just nodding off, actually.  Nodding off, and Jimmy is fling.  I'm sure you have to get up at this time in the morning.  It's a pretty miracle.  Are you usually not up at all?  Like, you live the right time of life.  If I'm just about going to bed.  You stay up all night, normally drinking and causing a problem?  No, I don't drink.  I've never drunk in my life.  Really? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  They're all laughing.  It's funny.  I remember somebody the other night kind of screaming into a mic.  It must have been somebody else.  It wasn't.  Oh, that was me nephew.  I have a good photo to show you off air of us taking a picture together.  I've never been happier in my life about anything.  Did you guys, writing the new songs, any different technique than the old days,  or did you have to, was it harder for you guys to write something in, you know,  a new millennium than it was years ago, or did you just keep the same formula? 
[02:04:00]  I don't want to hog the mic.  You want to go for that one, Tom?  Oh, never mind.  I'll take that one.  Give me my mic that works.  Crank them up.  No, it was really easy.  Really simple.  How come that mic can't work?  Yeah, why?  God damn it.  That one doesn't work either.  No, it's...  What the fuck?  Come on.  We'll do this.  We can get four mics to work in here, can't we?  I'll give mine up.  If there were three fat chicks, then yeah, them.  Three fat chicks, every mic could be working.  There you go. 
[02:04:30]  No, it was really simple.  We just sat down and just like it was in the past, you know, just come up with stuff,  knowing the different things.  I mean, I'm just thinking like, obviously, I know as I get older, my comedy kind of changes,  my taste in things change.  Did that affect you guys as far as your writing went?  Are you able to write about the same stuff you did, you know, 20 years ago?  No, I don't think so.  I think this was, you know, definitely, from my perspective anyway, you know, as a lyric  writer, it was different. 
[02:05:00]  Because I think, there's an example of that really.  When we got back together the second, actually the first time we had another reunion, when  we did the album Dehumanizer, I think everyone expected the album that we were going to give  them to be Heaven and Hell Jr.  Because that's what people expected after, you know, 10 years of not being together.  Well, they're going to give us Heaven and Hell.  Well, we went completely the opposite way.  And I think that in this same way, we didn't want it to be Heaven and Hell. 
[02:05:30]  We didn't want it to be those.  But because we are what we are, we're creatures of the same writing habits, I think, they could  have easily populated any of those albums that I mentioned.  So it just was this unbelievable lack of gap for some reason.  This time, 14 years later, we wrote the same way, which is why it worked the first time.  So not a problem.  All right.  How surprised are you guys?  I mean, you start in what, 1969 or 68, you first get together.  And then here you are, you know, X amount of years later, selling out a 5,000 seat or 
[02:06:00]  6,000 seat venue in under a half hour.  I mean, I mean, that's pretty miraculous.  And you're doing it with not only a different singer, but a drummer that wasn't originally  with the band, a great drummer of Minneapolis, who you came in on the Heaven and Hell tour,  and then you did Mob Rules, you did Live Evil, you did Dehumanizer.  So he's a legitimate member of Black Sabbath, not just a billboard replacement.  I mean, you've been with Sabbath quite a while.  Yeah, I'm kind of in the extended family here.  Right.  Yeah.  So, actually, I've done three albums with Ronnie singing, and Bill did one. 
[02:06:30]  So I'm actually a couple up on Bill here, finally.  It's kind of cool.  It's like, it's really weird.  Like, it's kind of like a bunch of guys who are just banging the same chicks, like back  and forth.  Yeah.  Very incestuous.  Musical incest.  Yeah.  You guys ever swap girls, do you?  Do you ever swap chicks at this point, or are you just kind of like done with that part?  We can't tell.  We swap.  It's one of them now.  Well, it's your turn.  He's got what he had a couple of months ago. 
[02:07:00]  Well, did you, Ronnie, did you see the episode of South Park with your character in it?  What did you think of that?  Well, I was really worried about it, to tell you the truth, because when they first called  and said, we want to do a South Park about Ronnie, initially I said, absolutely not, because  I've seen what they've done to other people.  Oh, yeah, crucify him.  What they promised me, they said, look, we're really, really big fans, and we wouldn't do  anything to make him feel bad.  Yeah.  So I thought, you know, if you want to be an American icon, you've got to have that in  your resume. 
[02:07:30]  That's pretty much it, yeah.  So I said, okay, and they were really kind to me, but if you remember the episode, they  were not kind to the drummer.  No.  He eventually turned into a monkey who was having a wank.  Sorry, Gordon.  Was that you, Vinny?  Was that me?  Probably.  Oh, it was the drummer.  So it probably was.  They were turning into a wanking monkey.  Oh, really?  Uh-oh.  Well, that sussed you then, Vinny.  That's not bad.  I guess all those years you put in, and that's what the people remember you for, being a wanking 
[02:08:00]  monkey.  I guess I kind of, like, respect that in some odd way.  Like, you guys will never have that claim to fame to be a wanking monkey.  Yep.  All right, so the girls are not as prevalent as they used to be, or are you just guys kind  of done with that and over it?  Non-existent, and I meant not as prevalent.  That's like one of our road shows.  Jesus Christ.  Bunch of fat guys.  It is amazing how many guys, was there ever a guy in the band, did you guys ever, like,  wind up like, all right, well, I'm the one who usually gets stuck with the fatty?  Was there anybody who kind of got, like, that tag thrown on them?  No, I think we always look for the fat ones, because they're the 
[02:08:30]  easy ones.  Just thinking about crap services that I need to come up with stem on them, of course.  No, we don't even bother looking for them.  Oh, that's awful.  Just get off stage and go, ah, why bother?  Where's the bird?  There's times as a comic where I'm on stage, and I just know, like, I'm having a bad show.  Like, do you guys feel that ever, too?  Like, today, like, when you're on stage, you're just going, like, this is, like, ugh, this  is not what we want. 
[02:09:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think everybody must do that, you know.  What do you do?  I mean, you can't just, you can't pull it.  Carry on.  I guess that was a stupid question.  What do they think they did?  They cry and run off the stage.  They call their mommies.  The worst for us is you always want to do your best, and if something goes wrong on stage,  it's always upsetting, really, in one way or the other.  You know, if something blows up or, you know, you can't get the proper sound or whatever it  might be, you know, that's what affects us, really.  I know as a singer, because I used to sing in a few rock bands in my day, there were those 
[02:09:30]  days where right when you stepped out, you just knew, wow, I am on tonight.  Like, I could hit notes all night long, and then there were some of those nights where  you're like, oh, boy, this one's going to be a little bit of a chore.  You're building up the notes about a couple of seconds ahead of you, and you've got to  take that extra breath.  You ever have those nights where you're...  I've had those nights, but that's usually due to, as you'll remember, having a cold.  Yeah, yeah.  Cold to do it.  You don't have a cold. 
[02:10:00]  Everything's cool.  But, you know, singing is such a physical task that, you know, for me, it's worry more  than anything else.  Really?  If I think I'm going to have a problem the next day, I can't sleep at all.  I do nothing but worry.  I test my voice all the time, you know, all through the night, and hope it works.  You ever think you're going to be shot, and then you get out on stage and just sound amazing?  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that something?  Yeah.  I never understood that.  It's like, God damn, I can't...  After doing, like, maybe four days in a row, and you're like, oh, man, I'm getting a little  chewed up in the throat.  This is going to be a bad one tonight. 
[02:10:30]  I hope you rearrange the set list a little bit.  And then you get out there and you go, what the hell was I worried about?  You know?  No.  No?  Of course not.  You're amazing, you bastard.  The worst thing, the worst thing for a performer is when you have to take a dump the minute  you walk on stage.  There's nothing more horrifying than that heavy feeling in your stomach, and you're like,  I got another hour and ten to go.  This is not going to be easy.  Well, we wear a lot of rubber trousers.  You talk a lot about nerves before, but you guys, I mean, everyone you're walking out 
[02:11:00]  still get the butterflies, get the nerves.  I don't.  No.  I do.  With the first gig of this tour in Vancouver, I was literally cacking myself in the bar all  day long.  You were nervous.  I thought there was nothing else to come out, yeah.  I think I was still doing it when I was on stage.  Thank God for Depend.  And not only do you guys have a new album, you are doing an in-store, too, which I know 
[02:11:30]  is tomorrow, Tuesday afternoon at 6 p.m.  Where exactly is it?  Best Buy.  Best Buy.  Best Buy where?  Midtown Best Buy.  You guys are going to be signing Black Sabbath, the D.O. years.  Yep.  I will somehow manage to weasel myself over there as well.  Of course you will.  Why wouldn't you?  You want to go down and meet the guys.  I mean, you've all been really nice every time I've met you, so I love you guys.  I'm so happy that you're back out.  Thank you, Jim.  A lot of success, man.  A lot of success.  You guys are amazing.  Thank you.  Continued success.  Absolutely. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you.  Thanks, Opie.  And we apologize for the mics not all working.  I know that's kind of frustrating, so thank you guys for coming.  But if you knew this place, you'd go, no, it's figures.  Yeah.  The good part is that at least one of them worked.  That's excellent.  Yeah.  Well, very, very good.  Thank you, guys.  We greatly appreciate it.  We've got to move over to XM Satellite Radio.  If you're not joining us over there, have a great day.  Once again, Black Sabbath, heaven and hell.  The D.O. years is the...  Yes.  It comes out tomorrow.  Thanks, man. 
[02:12:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  With me, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It comes out tomorrow.  And with me.  It comes out tomorrow.  It comes out tomorrow. 
[02:13:00]  It comes out tomorrow.  Or he's the Opie and Anthony Show.  ¶¶

[02:17:00]  We continue on XM Satellite Radio, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hola.  Are we getting the other guy on?  You doing it right now?  Hey, Bill.  Yes?  Hold on a minute.  He doesn't know you're going to be jumping in on this interview, all right?  All right.  All right.  We're working together today.  How do you like that?  Isn't that great? 
[02:17:30]  Isn't that amazing how things work sometimes?  All right.  Hold on.  We're all going to hell together.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's go, Don.  You're from the Catholic League.  We're talking to the artist that came up with the chocolate Jesus.  The chocolate Jesus, the nude chocolate Jesus.  And Bill is not happy.  No, I saw him on TV.  Not happy.  And we've seen both sides, but we haven't seen anyone put the two together.  Yeah.  I want to see the two kind of...  So that's what we're attempting today.  Yeah.  ...kind of talk together.  All right.  What's... 
[02:18:00]  I guess it's line 11.  We have the artist.  Good.  Mr. Artist.  Hello.  Hey, buddy.  Cosimo.  Hey, Opie.  How are you?  All right.  It's Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  And little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Norton.  Jimmy, hi.  Hello, everyone.  The story's getting a lot of press lately.  Yes, it is.  See about your chocolate Jesus.  Uh-huh.  And am I right?  Because I've heard this on the news, but I want to make sure.  Is it nude?  Completely nude?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, I saw a picture.  With male genitalia.  Yes. 
[02:18:30]  And on the cross, made of chocolate.  No, it's not on the cross.  It's an ascending Jesus.  Oh, okay.  On the cross, I'm ascending, okay.  And is it life-size?  Yes, it is.  Okay.  And this was supposed to be displayed in a hotel, and the hotel backed out and said no.  No, it's not in a hotel.  It's in a gallery that happens to be at the corner of the hotel, and it has windows to the street.  And it was going to be exhibited in the window, like viewing, you know? 
[02:19:00]  Okay, so this would have been open to the public as they were just walking down the sidewalk?  Yes, between certain hours.  There was, like, from 6 to 7, there would be a viewing.  So the curtains would open up, and then there would be another viewing at 12 to 1 in the morning.  So there was a sign saying the times that there would be this viewing.  Okay.  And you didn't feel that this in any way would maybe be offensive?  You know, it would be not to the degree that the Catholic League turned it out to be, you know? 
[02:19:30]  No.  Can we ask you, what was your motive in doing it?  I mean, in all honesty, what was your motive in doing it the way you did it?  In all honesty, it was my excitement to make this body of Christ come to life, and using chocolate, using an edible material.  Would you have done that with Muhammad?  No, that's simply because I'm not Muslim.  And if I were Muslim, and I were living in that tradition and grew up with that religion, I may have done something with Muhammad, you know, celebrating the love I have for my God, my Lord. 
[02:20:00]  You do understand, though, you wouldn't have just gotten a little controversy and news with that.  You probably would have gotten killed for making an image of Muhammad.  But, you know, that's the difference.  You know, my religion teaches me tolerance.  And what I learned as a child was if you get slapped in the face, you turn the other cheek and offer it. 
[02:20:30]  So what I'm surprised here is that in America, the civil rights, the First Amendment, has been trashed and hijacked here.  And to the point where these people were terrorized to stop from expressing themselves in a gallery.  I mean, if you're not going to be able to do it in a gallery, express your views.  And, you know, in due respect, there is no negativity here.  But the more we analyze the subject, the more we're going to talk about it, you're going to realize I'm just simply celebrating and maybe making a comment on the commercialization of Jesus and chocolate. 
[02:21:00]  But the truth is, I wanted to put that taste in your mouth, that you can have the sweet taste as you see this ascending Jesus.  It's becoming holy in spirit.  Now, when I go to church and they give me a little wafer, I accept it as the body of Christ.  And the celebration of Christ is his body and spirit.  So I don't understand why they decided to inflame hatred.  Because the whole opinion is that if the Muslims, if somebody does something against Mohammed, the Muslim starts killing people. 
[02:21:30]  So therefore, we should do the same.  No, the opposite.  We should not.  That's not an example.  I think one of the biggest issues, though, is the nudity was not showing respect.  I think that was a problem.  But to get another view on this, let's talk to Bill, Bill Donahue, the Catholic League, around with Cosimo, the artist.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  Well, first of all, I'd have more respect for him if he was just honest.  But he's not a Catholic.  He hates the Catholic Church.  I've seen what he said about the Catholic Church.  And he referred to the little wafer here.  Well, he just referred to it as a donut the other day on a show with my director of communications, Kira.  So we know where he's coming from.  Look, he also lied about the fact the gallery.  The hotel owns the gallery, okay?  Let's get this thing straight, which is why this guy, Knowles, who I went after, who owns the Roger Smith Hotel, had to put out a statement. 
[02:22:30]  He never apologized for what happened.  He just simply had his own monetary interest involved because we scared the hell out of him on this thing.  It was on street level.  Any kid could go in off the street.  And with the genitalia exposed, they forgot to add one thing, fellas.  He forgot to say that he invited the public to come in and eat him.  So I guess what part of the body he would go for first, I'm not even going to comment on.  But, you know, quite frankly, I said to this guy the other night, I said, if I called this art, if this is art, then could it be art also? 
[02:23:00]  If we had a chocolate figure of his mother with genitalia exposed and we asked everybody to eat her on Mother's Day?  I asked him that on TV the other night.  He never answered me.  So I'm going to ask you again, pal.  What's your answer?  My answer is, Bill, if you would like to do it, do it.  Wow.  That's how much respect you have for your own mother?  Yeah, I know I have respect for my mother, but your expression of my mother, if you really mean that, do it.  What can I tell you?  That's your expression on my mother. 
[02:23:30]  Bill, do you?  Bill.  I can't judge what you're going to do.  Now, the other thing, Bill, I'd like to tell you is, with all due respect, you know, this is a gallery, and it was close to the public.  If you can only see it through the window, number one, number two, Jesus was publicly exposed, hung in the public, naked.  There's nothing wrong, and there's naked statues all over the Vatican, from Brunelleschi to Michelangelo.  So there is nothing wrong.  Now, the obsession, and I call it a donut because I'm referring to the shape, the roundness of it. 
[02:24:00]  I mean, you have a hard time.  First of all, you're not a critic of art, and you shouldn't be messing in it because you should.  And I'm not sure that you're a good representative of the Catholic religion.  To call me a liar, you know nothing of me.  And I'm not going to question your faith, either.  But you shouldn't question mine.  You don't know nothing of me.  And I think you stooped so low, that's all you do.  You have stooped so low, you've shamed a lot of people.  A lot of people.  I am very happy with the response that I've gotten from all these non-Catholics who are on my side in the media, who came in here one after another. 
[02:24:30]  They're on my side.  But, Phil, you know what's shameful?  Your words.  You told me to go put Christ in a garbage dump in Jersey.  That's correct.  Staten Island has a garbage dump also.  Yeah, but your root, this is the way you want to see Christ portrayed, in a garbage dump.  No, the way you have.  If you go into any garbage dump in Jersey, you see him.  I haven't, Phil.  You don't see his genitals exposed.  You have it as a loincloth.  You know that as well as I do.  No, no, no, no.  That was Sarah Vignola, who decided to burn statues and paintings of Christ. 
[02:25:00]  But Christ was always naked, and he's a man.  There's nothing shameful in that.  Maybe you're ashamed of what you're going to tell you.  We're going to have everybody eat him on Holy Week, right?  You're going to tell you.  And, you know, you're just ingenuous.  You expect that.  You're not fooling anybody.  Everybody who's contacted our office knows what you're trying to do.  Bill, I'm not trying to fool anybody.  I have the Lord on my side as well as you do.  I'm simply expressing myself and with integrity.  You could bully down their establishment because of their, you know, you went after them financially. 
[02:25:30]  But what do you want to do with me?  I mean, if you belong to the landfill in New Jersey or the landfill in Staten Island, you could have your choice.  That's where it belongs, in the garbage.  You, uh...  I don't mind your point of view, and that's fine.  I don't mind your point of view, Bill.  But why did you stop the exhibition?  You have the right to your point of view, Bill.  I don't mind that you want me to put it in a garbage dump.  Because it was offensive, and it was grotesque, and the public was on my side, and that's where they had to pull it out.  Bill, according to you, then, you're becoming the authority on what we should be allowed to expose. 
[02:26:00]  So you are now saying what would be offensive.  And this is where church and state, you've crossed the line, you see?  Bill...  You know what?  I'm not putting it in your church.  You don't have to accept it in your church.  But you know what?  Roll up the carpet on the sidewalk, because anything could be offensive to you.  Well, I told you, some dumb and sorrow will put it up.  Bill, that is the SS.  That's the Gestapo.  If that's the way you want to live...  That's the Gestapo.  So I can't even put out a news release.  I'm the Gestapo now? 
[02:26:30]  No, you're proposing.  That's what you're proposing.  You're proposing that...  I didn't know.  I said, get it out of Midtown Manhattan during Holy Week.  Your little exhibition, having people go in there and eat genes and genitalia.  Why should I do that?  I know what this is all about, and so do you.  All you have to do is be honest about it.  You see, the hatred that you have in you, Bill, is that you're upset that we're very...  I have the hatred?  You didn't...  I didn't start this.  You did.  No, no.  You started this, because you know what?  If you hadn't opened your mouth, people would go and see it, and there was nothing wrong.  But you started the hatred.  I stopped violence from taking place, because a lot of people would have been over there today. 
[02:27:00]  I think what you're saying is...  Some of them would have gotten out of hand.  No, listen, Bill.  What I'm saying is this.  We should be celebrating the fact that we're tolerant, our religion.  We have to be tolerant.  You have nothing but intolerance toward my religion, sir, which is precisely why you put up this little stunt.  I learned...  Bill, I've learned my lesson to...  Just be honest.  That's all.  What's that?  Just be honest.  Just say you hate the Catholic Church.  I am honest.  You're not accepting my honesty, Bill.  And this is the way you like to express yourself.  That's all.  Bill, you're not accepting my honesty.  Maybe you're doubting yours. 
[02:27:30]  I'm telling you mine.  I'm telling you, and I don't know any other way.  The fact that you don't accept my honesty is what's wrong here.  You're doubting my honesty.  How come the public is on my side and not on yours?  But you don't know that.  You don't know...  Yes, of course I know that.  What do you think they canceled the event?  What do you think they canceled the event for?  The event was canceled because you terrorized them.  The man is afraid.  And I'm going to tell you something.  There's a lot of other people that wouldn't have canceled the event.  But just because you were able to be one man doesn't mean that everybody's on your side, Bill. 
[02:28:00]  If they are, I'm going to tell you.  They were overrun with phone calls.  You read the press accounts.  Bill, listen.  The truth is, we'll find out.  You know what?  And you have cowards over there at the Roger Smith Hotel.  They should have stood by you then.  Well, you know, I'm not going to comment on whether they should have stood by me or not.  They did what they did.  They did what they did.  Yes.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to tell them what they should do, Bill.  This guy knows he was a coward.  He's the artist and resident, the president, the CEO, and he owns it. 
[02:28:30]  And he's a coward who's only afraid about the public came down his throat.  He's afraid of losing his almighty dollar, and that's what got him.  I love capitalism.  Listen, Bill, you're saying he's a coward because you bullied him?  Yeah, because he never apologized to us.  He never apologized to us.  He's basically on your side, but he's afraid of losing money.  But you agree then that you just said that the Catholic Church has the right to bully down people.  I'm not the Catholic Church.  In Congress.  Yes, you just said that.  You're happy that you bullied him. 
[02:29:00]  Yes, of course I'm happy.  That is wrong.  I'm very happy about it.  I'm going to go out and have a drink about it tonight.  In fact, I had a lot of drinks over the weekend celebrating about you.  Hey, Bill, can I ask you a question about this chocolate Jesus?  Are you most upset at the fact that it's nude, the fact that it's made of chocolate,  or the fact that it was being displayed where perhaps children could pass by and see it?  It's basically the Roger Smith Hotel, 47th and Lexington, right down the block from the Waldorf Astoria. 
[02:29:30]  It's obviously street level.  So, yeah, that's what, look, we have artists like this who do this kind of stuff all the time.  Now, if it was in a loincloth, would you be as upset?  I wouldn't have raised an objection at all unless they invited the public in to eat him.  If they just displayed a chocolate Jesus with a loincloth, I wouldn't have said anything.  So, Bill, was it the nudity, Bill, or was it more the glib attitude?  Like, if it was a nude, because he raised a good point about there being nude statues in the Vatican and blah, blah, blah. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Was it the nudity, or was it the fact that you thought that there was a wink and a little nudge there,  and you knew what it was?  Well, it was the fact that it was the nudity, that this is not the way we understand Christ when we go to church.  And the fact that they invited the public in to eat him, I mean, this is such an in-your-face,  taking the middle finger right at the Catholic community.  And they chose Holy Week.  You see, this is the other thing.  This isn't September.  They know exactly what they're doing.  And so, you know, this is a direct assault. 
[02:30:30]  They just wanted to tease us one more time, push the envelope, and, of course, they lost.  Cosmo, did you really say, come in and eat him?  And what's that?  No, I never did.  No, the exhibition was in a window.  You couldn't go into the gallery.  They were only viewed from the street.  So it never was intended to be eaten, number one.  Number two, what Bill was saying is, then, therefore, you know, I can show this,  and he will not harass the people at the hotel and the gallery.  If I show it any other day other than the Holy Holidays,  then he should then tell everybody that he excuses himself 
[02:31:00]  and allows all Christians to go view it as a peaceful act of art,  because I will exhibit it on the other days than the Holy Days of Easter.  I know a lot of artists do controversial pieces to get their name out there.  A lot of them have done that in the past,  and a lot have used the Catholic religion and icons from the Catholic religion  to make a name for themselves.  Are you saying you've done this in no way was this done to make controversy  to get your name into it using the Catholic religion, 
[02:31:30]  which, by the way, does seem to be a religion that people can kind of goof on  without the repercussions of a lot of other religions, Jewish or Muslim?  So, therefore, you've answered my question.  No, because I was doing the opposite, you see.  I've had a lot of publicity when I did cheese in a hotel room,  and I expressed my work with food.  What I was trying to do here was the opposite,  that I knew that we were tolerant.  And what I was trying to do is to say,  here I'm going to bring this statue as close as possible to life 
[02:32:00]  by putting it as an edible material that, as this Christ is ascending,  I'm left with the taste of a sweet Lord.  Even though he's been brutalized, humiliated,  he's still leaving me with a sweet taste.  That was my conversation.  I did this sculpture three years ago, and I went to see the church,  hoping, really naively, hoping that they would accept it in the church,  because that's where I believe we were, that this can be in the church.  It's a modern expression of our faith. 
[02:32:30]  That's of my faith.  I had no intention to, you know what,  if I wanted to humiliate this Lord, there was other materials to do it with.  Bill says that you're not a Catholic, or you're not,  I mean, would you want to say what faith, what denomination you are to clear that up?  Because I honestly don't know either.  I'm Catholic.  I'm a Catholic Christian.  Yeah, and I'm a Mormon.  I don't think Bill's buying the Catholic thing.  Well, you know what, you don't have to, but this is the issue. 
[02:33:00]  The fact that I have to make Bill, you know, believe in me, being Catholic, is absurd.  You know what I mean, what are you going to say?  Anybody who expresses themselves with Jesus is not a Catholic?  No, I read what you said about the Catholic Church.  You hate the Catholic Church.  Bill, what did I say about the Catholic Church?  Bill, what did I say about the Catholic Church, Bill?  You slandered a bunch of gangsters who run the church and everything else.  I saw your comment.  Bill, Bill, no.  You know what? 
[02:33:30]  You've been misquoted, huh?  Bill, what I'm saying is what you're saying.  You basically accepted that you bullied a private establishment  to refuse to exhibit their work of art.  That's right.  That is what you're saying, you're a bully.  And all I'm saying is you're right.  And let me just tell you something.  Have you done this to Moses?  Have you done this to Muhammad and everybody else?  You tell me that Jews and Muslims would just sit back and say,  Oh, we think this is pretty nice.  Bill, this is the bottom of it.  See, everybody that has this hatred keeps coming up. 
[02:34:00]  What if you did it to Muhammad?  What if I'm not Muslim?  And number one, number two...  Well, do it tomorrow.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  It's just because, Bill, just because we are tolerant as Catholics  doesn't mean that we're wrong.  You have a hell of a nerve saying you're tolerant.  You put out your intolerant, blasphemy, obscene statue of Jesus  asking people to eat it during Holy Week.  And don't say you didn't ask them to eat it because we have that transcript, too.  I did not ask anybody to eat it.  That was the whole setup.  That's exactly why people are angry. 
[02:34:30]  And there's a lot of people who are not Catholic who are angry at you.  Bill, you're ill-informed.  Oh, really?  I'll tell you, I did not...  All the media reports are wrong, too.  I did not ask them for you.  Listen, Bill, you're ill-informed.  There's 647 media reports on this, and they're all wrong, I guess, huh?  I guess you have a lot of phone calls to me today, Bob.  Bill, you could decipher the media from the truth.  Listen, whatever media is doing, I have no control over it.  But I can tell you one thing.  How can I invite the people to eat it if it's closed in an enclosed space that you can't get in?  You can only view it from the outside.  What, eat your way through the window? 
[02:35:00]  Well, I tell you, that's what your gallery guy said.  He quit.  Why did this guy quit, anyhow?  He didn't quit, Bill.  He had to say he quit.  He's the nephew of the owner of the hotel.  He had to quit because he's been harassed.  Oh, this is incestuous, man.  You know what you've ensued?  I don't like this.  Bill, you know what you've ensued?  I bet he was going to get the first bite, huh?  Bill, you've ensued death threats on people.  Would it be his toe?  Would he go for the toe?  Well, you know something?  I've got to agree with him on one thing, Bill.  You sure do now how to bully companies into getting people thrown out of places.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[02:35:30]  I'll give you that much.  Did I just say Jesus to Bill Donahue?  Am I insane?  Bill, it does seem like, though, whereas I understand not wanting some glib, snotty attitude about  Christ under the guise of being artistic, it does seem like the church or Catholics or whatever  you want to call it, have a very, a very, a bit of an ancient attitude when it comes to nudity.  And I'm not talking about pornography, and I'm not talking about things like Mapplethorpe.  I'm talking about just a genuinely nude figure where nothing sexual is happening. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, that's true.  And I think that I have no problem with that.  Context means everything.  But I don't think that we're going to, you know, this guy here is just trying to be  jazzy about what he's trying to do, choosing Holy Week in the Roger Smith Hotel, and the  public can come in and eat him.  I mean, the whole thing is not exactly Michelangelo.  Was he crucified nude, Bill?  Well, I don't know that.  But all I know is that in every church, they have a loincloth around him.  And that's the way we understand him. 
[02:36:30]  Well, Bill, in fairness, and again, I'm not one of these people that wants to, you know,  a history revisionist, but I mean, Christ has been, it seems like historically, according  to the way people look, I'm not saying Christ was black, but I do think that he's been portrayed  a little bit whiter with different hair, probably, in the church than you would say, than was  probably historically correct.  So, I mean, the church may not have gotten everything right, and you're well aware of  that.  That's true.  So, I mean, just because...  And I don't get offended by a black Jesus, either, by the way.  Okay.  So, I'm saying, if that's an accurate portrayal, and it's not being done to be disgusting, then why would 
[02:37:00]  the nudity bother you so much, if the artist is coming out and saying, no, it was not done  to be disgusting, if you're going to make an artistic statement, doesn't it seem like  you'd say, this is the statement I'm making, and here the artist is going, no, I never said  eat him, the media got it wrong.  Isn't there a part of you that goes, all right, well, maybe the media did get it wrong?  I think that if you really want to be tolerant toward someone's religion, you portray the  figure you're talking about the way that people understand him.  And as I said, when we see pictures of Christ crucified, we don't see him naked. 
[02:37:30]  We see him with the loincloth.  So, if you're going to be respectful, that's what you do.  If you want to be disrespectful, you show him the way, with the genitals exposed, and you  ask people to eat him.  But you just said...  I mean, that is very clear to me.  Forget the eat him thing, only because he's saying he didn't say it.  I mean, maybe he's lying, okay, whatever, but he is denying it as a person on the phone.  But you're saying that the black Jesus didn't offend you, and that's not the way it's  been portrayed in the church.  So, why would the nude...  In one breath, you're saying black Jesus doesn't offend you, and in the other breath, you're  saying, well, the nude does, because that's not the way we've seen him.  Well, because, I mean, the fact of the matter is that African Americans, many of them are 
[02:38:00]  Catholic, about 10% or so, and if that's their representation, I can understand it.  I would be upset would Christ be portrayed as a woman, because we know that Christ was  not a woman.  Just as blacks would be offended by Martin Luther King, all of a sudden becomes a female.  You have to be at least somewhat close.  And yes, the color of the skin is something that's open to debate.  So if you want to make him darker, that's okay.  But that's all within the parameters of acceptable artistic license, so to speak. 
[02:38:30]  This is not.  This is taking license in a grotesque way with my religion during Holy Week, trying to  be flashy about it.  And quite frankly, all these people who are not Catholic, and believe me, we've been  talking to a whole bunch of them, people who have no religion whatsoever, they know exactly  what this is all about, and that's why they were on our side.  Otherwise, we never could have convinced them.  I didn't even put the phone number or the email address or anything of that nature of  Roger Smith up on our website.  This is the public.  You know, I'm not going to agree with you on this one completely, Bill. 
[02:39:00]  There are some issues.  I think art stands on its own merit.  If people want to see something, then let them see it.  I think the artist has a right to make whatever art he wants.  But the thing that concerns me is there is a certain cowardice with these artists that  they do know that there will be huge consequences and repercussions if they use another religion  besides the Catholic religion, and that's where I think they wuss out, where they're 
[02:39:30]  free to say, hey, this is how I want to interpret Jesus.  This is how I want to interpret Mary, made out of like elephant dung.  I think we had that a while back.  But they will not touch Muhammad or Moses because they know that there will be more than just  them getting thrown out of an art exhibit.  I'll give you another example.  Harold Washington, the past mayor of Chicago, a black guy, they had pictures of him in 
[02:40:00]  a museum in Chicago here about maybe 15 years ago after he died, and they had pictures of  him wearing underwear.  You know what the city council did?  The city council ordered it out.  The police went into the museum and took it out, and there was no outcry.  Now, I'd never, I would rather put up with any indignity before it ever asked the police.  I would, I am opposed to any government action.  That's not the right remedy.  But he has a First Amendment right to put out his art.  I have a First Amendment right to object to it. 
[02:40:30]  And if the public is on my side and not on his side, that's what a free society is all  about.  He lost.  That's all I can say.  I have a duty to, you know, you have an NAACP for blacks, you have GLAAD for gays, you  have ADL for Jews.  All of these organizations respond the way I do when they find out there's some outrage.  The fact of the matter is, I have to respond more often, because it's more typically I'm  the one being, my religion is being attacked more.  Hey, the busier you are, the better. 
[02:41:00]  Then you won't keep an eye on us.  That's what I say, Bill.  And does the artist have any response to, because, I mean, do you have any response  to, I mean, we kind of keep it fair?  Yeah, kind of polish it up here.  No, I give the last word to Bill.  What kind of chocolate did you use, by the way?  Was it good chocolate?  Yes, 100% cocoa.  100% cocoa chocolate.  That is a good, that is a good chocolate, Bill.  Bill?  And Cosmo, any plans on displaying it elsewhere?  Not right now.  Not right now.  Okay.  You want to bring it by? 
[02:41:30]  But I will ask Bill if he would accept it in the church.  I'd be glad to put it in.  Well, you already know the answer.  Bill already said Staten Island or Jersey.  Absolutely.  I just go out of the landfill.  Bill, Bill, I would love to have a conversation with you anytime, and I would love to have  you accept the Christ in the church.  Maybe over two chocolate martinis.  The problem I...  The thing is, Bill, Bill, really, I think...  The problem I...  You know, it was a misunderstood situation, and I would love to have a conversation because 
[02:42:00]  ideally, this should belong in the church, in a glass, case, refrigerator.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Cosmo!  No, Bill, listen.  Cosmo!  Bill, you should be open to this.  Listen, there's a lot of people, like there's a lot of people that you're receiving the phone call saying it's disgusting.  There's a lot of people saying it's wonderful.  But remember, it took the Christian church a long time to accept Christ. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, Cosmo, can you...  I'm willing to wait for this exception.  Can you put hair on the thing? That's what really creeped me out.  It was kind of a bald Jesus.  We're used to Jesus with the long flowing locks.  Why is there no hair?  There's all kinds of interpretations, but this is mine.  Well, guys, why don't we just agree to disagree?  There you go, Opie. That's the answer. Agree to disagree.  We're going to agree to disagree on this one.  Any final thoughts from Bill Donahue or Cosmo, the artist there? 
[02:43:00]  I just wish him well. I don't go out and hate people.  I just think that it didn't belong there.  But now that it's over, I don't hold any grudges.  Maybe I will get loaded with him someday.  Bill actually doesn't hold grudges. I will say that for Bill.  And is it true, I mean, Bill, obviously we all know that Black Sabbath is doing a signing tomorrow  at the Best Buy at Midtown, and I wanted to know what your feelings on that  and the new album, Black Sabbath, the D.O. years, what were?  You're going to give me more work?  No, no, no. There's no controversy there. They're just a band. 
[02:43:30]  I think there were some Satan-worshipping rumors in their past.  Oh, no, no, no.  Hey, Cosmo, you're kind of lucky because you get to continue being an artist.  Bill Donahue, he was just a nudge when it came to what we were doing,  and we lost our careers for two years.  Yeah, at least you get to work.  Wouldn't that be funny if Bill walked around with a giant jar of peanut butter  and said, you got your Jesus in my peanut butter?  And then they make millions together making some kind of peanut butter chocolate.  Hey, Bill, I've got to ask you this.  What did you do before you were president of the Catholic League? 
[02:44:00]  Like, what was your job?  I was a professor of sociology and political science at a small college in Pittsburgh at La Roche,  and then I was at the Heritage Foundation,  and I started out teaching in Spanish Harlem with the little black and Puerto Rican kids  up on 104th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue.  Okay. I'll say one thing.  Bill's not a typical, quote-unquote, religious representative.  You know, he kind of sounds like a guy that you know.  Sounds like he loves his drink.  Yeah, I think Bill references alcohol a lot.  I like that.  That's true. I'll probably be arrested someday. 
[02:44:30]  Is that your favorite part, you know, when it comes to drinking the blood?  You're probably first in line to get that sip of wine.  It is true that I go to pubs and not museums.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, well.  Hey, guys, thank you so much.  And, Cosmo, you'll find out, even though Bill kind of screws you here and there,  he's a likable guy.  I don't know what it is about this guy, but he can screw you,  throw you out of your job for a while, but you like him.  I don't know what it is about you, Bill.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  It's some kind of divine thing.  I wish Bill would hire me. 
[02:45:00]  If I'm Bill, I'll hire you.  All right, you two.  They almost like each other at the end of this.  You two are great.  It's like WWF.  You ought to shave each other's heads or something.  You guys can bring us together.  Yeah, we try.  All right.  All right, guys.  I hope you work things out there, and good luck to both of you.  I want to say thank you to Bill, because, Bill, really,  you got me noticed all over the world.  That's true, Bill.  All right, guys.  What's your next project, Cosmo?  I've been trying to get a jelly-filled room, 
[02:45:30]  a gallery to be filled with jelly, strawberry jam.  Does anyone paint anymore?  Yeah, no kidding.  I love paintings.  I like the seamlessness.  Melting cheese.  I hear Mickey Mouse with a butt plug is next, taking on that Disney empire.  What I do, guys, is I try to make my work seamless,  and that it is part of our society.  It's not framed.  It's not standing on a pedestal.  You know what I like?  I like the dogs playing poker, Cosmo.  I got to tell you. 
[02:46:00]  I like the cats smoking cigars, too.  Cats and cigars.  Wait.  I got to follow this through, though.  I like Monica smoking the cigars.  See, there's no time to hear what.  I love Bill.  See, he's a dirty boy.  Let's be honest.  I like Bill.  Cosmo.  How do you not love Bill?  Wait.  I got to tell you something.  We're still sending smoke signals, so.  Yeah, Cosmo.  So, the room full of jelly, like, explain to me why that's art.  Because it feels great, you know, and it's an experience that you, it's your body.  It's not as a bat. 
[02:46:30]  You know, the idea is that you walk into it, and you have this body experience.  Yeah, I got to.  A visual experience.  I got to learn about art a little more.  Like, they had those gates in Central Park a few years back.  Yeah, the gates.  I was like, what a crock of shit this is.  I don't get it.  I walked around trying to experience something.  I don't know what I was supposed to experience.  Yeah, I got to get in on this.  I was going to make a few bucks off of this.  Yeah.  Sometimes, you get things a little later on, you know.  So, give it to me.  Bill, do you have a curse?  Yeah.  Bill, do you curse?  Do you have a curse?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  I'm Irish.  What do you think?  Give us one curse.  It's satellite radio.  We want the big one, too, by the way.  You could probably say, hey, Cosmo, I think your sculpture's a piece of shit.  Let's go, Bill.  Come on.  You owe us, Bill.  You owe us.  I got to beg off.  Yeah.  Listen, I think Bill likes it more than he's saying he likes it.  Of course.  But, honestly, I think we started this backwards.  Had we started this, this way, and ended up the other way.  It'll all work out in the end. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  It'll all go on with the church and the Catholic League, and your art will be displayed, and  Sabbath will still put on more albums.  What else is there?  If there's a God, there's an intervention, I know there is.  I believe, truly, it will end up in the church.  You know, and if John Paul was still alive, I'm sure it would be.  He was a bit of a conservative pope.  I'm not a popologist, but he was a bit conservative for popes.  I don't think so.  I don't think he'd be going for that one.  And, in fairness, look, I mean, the church is the church.  I don't see them putting up just, like, you know, audience submissions. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, they kind of, I guess, have a, I got to kind of side with the church on that.  You can't just throw a naked chocolate Christ in and expect the church to display it.  That's a little.  They seem to only use one mold.  Yeah.  Yeah, when it comes to their, yeah.  Well, you know, I have to stay on with you, but I do have this Latino radio show on the  same subject, and I promised this guy, Diego, that I'd have to go.  Otherwise, I'd stay on with you.  All right, Bill.  Thanks for at least talking for a while.  Thank you.  Very multicultural, Bill Duny.  Bye, guys.  Love it.  Take it easy, Bill.  Hey, Cosmo.  Hey, Cosmo, we'll say goodbye to you, too, all right? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, good luck, man.  Hey, by the way, now that that nuch is off the phone, you want to bring the chocolate Jesus  over here?  We'll have some fun.  Take a few bites, me and you.  I'm looking for, I'm really looking for a home for it, you know?  I really am, and that's it.  I mean.  I hear you.  All right.  Just put some hair on the damn thing.  Yeah.  So it doesn't look as creepy.  Put some.  Go to Carvel and get sprinkles.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Cosmo.  Take it easy, man.  Right on. 
[02:49:00]  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  There you go.  Look at us.  Look at us with the dialogue.  That is pretty cool, man.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone else got that.  That Bill Donahue, man, is he a character or what?  I want to hate him with all my soul.  Oh, my God.  When we were off, there was one man I hated more than any other, and it was Bill Donahue.  And then you realize, you know, I don't agree.  I absolutely don't agree with a lot of his positions on a lot of things.  Believe me.  But I don't know why.  God, the guy is so damn likable and funny. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  We're still talking about drinking, making jokes.  If we would have talked to Donahue about that church incident, he would have heard the  broadcast.  He probably still would have felt the same way because of his implication.  Right.  But I think if the company, Infinity at the time, would have arranged a meeting between  us and Bill and could have sat down and actually talked it out, I don't think we'd  have been off for two years.  The problem with Bill Donahue, he doesn't really do a lot of research.  No.  He has other people do it.  Other interns or something.  Remember Lucky Louie, all those bad quotes about Lucky Louie, and we get Louis C.K. 
[02:50:00]  on with Bill Donahue, and Bill's like, I don't remember saying any of these things.  I don't remember.  Well, people look up these things for me.  And Louis C.K. is like, this is your quote about the show.  Do you hear beer taps opening up and beer bottles opening in the background?  I don't know what that is.  Want me another one?  All right.  We're going to go to break with something we wanted to play a little earlier this morning.  Linkin Park has a new song out.  Today's the day.  Today's the day to hear What I've Done.  Is this an exclusive?  Well, it would have been if we got a little earlier, but, you know, a lot of people out 
[02:50:30]  there haven't heard it yet.  What I've Done.  It's Linkin Park as we go to break.  Check it out.  We'll see you next time,  We'll see you next time.  Bye.  A great time.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  In this farewell 
[02:51:00]  There's no blood  There's no alibi  Cause I've drawn regret  From the truth 
[02:51:30]  Of a thousand lies  So let mercy count  And wash away  What I've done  I'll face myself  To cross out what I've begun  You raise myself  And let go of what I've done 
[02:52:00]  But you've asked  What you thought of me  While I clean this slate  With the hands of uncertainty  So let mercy count  And wash away  What I've done  I'll face myself  To cross out what I've begun 
[02:52:30]  Go  Erase myself  And let go of what I've begun  Or what I've begun  I start again  Oh, well, I've been gone 
[02:53:00]  I start again  And whatever pain may come  Today this ends  I'm for giving word  Oh, well, I've been gone  I'll face myself  To cross out what I've become  Erase myself 
[02:53:30]  And let go of what I've done  What I've done  Forgiving what I've done  Hello Senors and Senoritas 
[02:54:00]  This is Jim Norton  And I'm coming to the Miami Improv  It's my first trip to Miami  April 567-305-441-8200  That's the Miami Improv in Florida  April 567-305-441-8200  Let's hope there's no storms  I'll see you next time  I'll see you next time  Easy as I want 
[02:54:30]  You'll get a hold on  You'll believe it  Like no other  Before you know it  You'll be on your knees  Head phải, red boots  And you gotta believe me  I saw her, I saw her with my own soul eyes  All right now!  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:55:00]  Right guitarist, right bassist.  Wrong vocalist, but still.  Fucking Sabbath, the D.O. years is on.  I'm going to keep plugging.  I'm really embarrassed about that stupid mic debacle.  The D.O. years is on sale tomorrow.  And the three new songs, I'm not just saying,  I'm a fan tune out here, they're fucking great tunes, man.  And they're doing an in-store.  I want to say, I'm not even going to mention the board,  but to the message board, I thought it would be a funny idea  to say that I have fucking health problems.  You know, this is why we don't fucking deal with fan boards anymore, 
[02:55:30]  because they're not fucking fan boards.  That thing, first of all, I hear Jimmy, like, goes to the site  and then thinks I got fucking medical problems.  I almost called Opie last night, 9 o'clock at night.  Yeah, and then other listeners were, and fucking,  and it was supposed to be an April Fool's joke, that's funny.  And don't try to bring the mayor thing into it,  because it was the Opie and Anthony comedy show  when we were doing that, and people knew it.  There was a goof, and then the way we presented it was a goof. 
[02:56:00]  This is presented as if I'm fucking laying in a hospital.  You know, you guys are a bunch of cunts, is what you are.  And, by the way, the board that it is, I will have your fucking name.  I'm working on it.  I got more fucking resources than you do.  That name's gonna be mine in no time.  And I'll fucking put it as a link to gay porno.  I don't care what the fuck I do with it.  You're not gonna own the fucking name, okay?  Dick bag.  So, print whatever you fucking want. 
[02:56:30]  I see right now, two people viewing.  Wow, running a blockbuster site over there, aren't ya?  But it's that kind of shit that gets sites delinked  and not fucking mentioned on this show.  That's it.  I go to other sites happily.  They know who they are.  I post on them, have fun on them.  But this fucking board could suck my fucking cock.  Done.  Done.  And I will own this fucking name. 
[02:57:00]  I'm working on it.  It's our name, asshole.  We will fucking own you.  We will fucking own you.  I got lawyers working on it right the fuck now.  And I don't care how much cash I gotta pour into it.  It's more than you.  As you scrape up money to make a bandwidth charge,  I'm fucking throwing money out the window to get this site away from you.  You cocksucker.  Die.  Fuck.  Die.  Thank you.  Now I'm happy.  I like it.  Hey, look. 
[02:57:30]  The people out there.  They know who they are.  That ain't no fucking fan site.  It ain't a fan site.  These guys, they think they're running fan sites.  You're not.  You're running a cunt site.  That's the problem I have.  And we're done with it.  That's the problem I have.  And you don't mention it?  And look at the post.  They're pathetic.  You got pathetic little posts  because no one goes to your fucking sites  unless we mention them on the show.  You think you're all fucking high and mighty?  We'll do what we want.  We'll do this.  I don't give a fuck.  Good.  Then we don't mention you. 
[02:58:00]  And the same five fucking people go to your site.  And that's what happens.  And I don't give a shit.  I will own your fucking site.  When a website has more negative comments than positive...  It's done.  I'm like, how could this possibly be a fan site for our show?  Yeah, so it gets de-linked  and five people end up going to it  and bitching each other about it.  What the fuck it did?  It's meant to be...  Freedom of speech.  It's freedom of speech.  You five people have a field day talking about it  because the site will not be fucking mentioned on this show. 
[02:58:30]  No, it's funny.  And they bring up freedom of speech  and they're like, you guys got freedom of speech?  I'm like, we do to a point.  To a point.  We edit ourselves every day.  We're like, ah, you know,  I'm not taking phone call three today.  I'm not going to read that guy's instant feedback today.  So we control our own destiny  as far as what kind of radio show we want to do.  And I've always said the same thing should happen with fan sites.  It's not complete freedom of speech.  And fan sites are fine.  People think we have a problem  if somebody has a bit they didn't find funny 
[02:59:00]  or something like that.  I applaud that.  That was a great statement.  Yeah, Opie made a...  Thank you.  The fucking boss made a point.  Thank you.  Jesus.  And it's fine if people want to say  that they didn't like a certain thing on the show  or anything  and it's written well and stuff like that  because everyone's not going to like everything.  That's fine.  I have no fucking problem with that.  Posts that go like,  everyone thinks the show sucks these days.  That's the kind of post that you want to reach in  and choke the idiot  because they're speaking for everyone 
[02:59:30]  and they're not giving any explanation.  Anything else is fine.  Like if they want to comment on certain things.  But something like that is like ridiculous.  Where people think I'm in the hospital.  That's a funny April Fool's gag  for a fan site to put up.  So my family and fucking Jimmy  and actual people that read the fucking thing  think that that might have happened.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm working on it.  I can fucking...  I can get that name in no time 
[03:00:00]  and I'm working on it.  And it's going to be a gay porno link site.  Why won't they just give you the name  if they're fans of the show?  That's what I don't get.  Because he's a little cunt  that thinks he's fucking got the world by the balls on this one.  You're going to fucking...  You're going down.  I'm taking your site away from you  because it involves my fucking name.  And it will be gay pornography.  You will see nothing.  When people go there  you will see nothing  but big men's dicks 
[03:00:30]  going up hairy assholes  spewing wads of jism  when you go to the site  that used to be your fan site.  That's what it's going to be.  And Danny will monitor it every hour.  Absolutely.  We're going to call it eatabullet.com.  Can you make sure there's a lot of ass cave pictures?  Fucking gaping asses will be  I enjoy a good ass cave picture  for the time to time.  That's what this great fucking fan site used to be.  You fucking cunt.  You're done. 
[03:01:00]  Fun site.  You douchebag.  Alright.  Hate these fucks.  Alright.  And now fighting back.  Not going to sit there and take the shit anymore.  Fucking fighting back.  Asshole.  You raised the point too.  It really is.  No one thinks that we're above criticism.  I mean look.  No one likes to be criticized.  It's human nature.  Yeah.  But I've actually read things  whether it's that board  or the other two.  I've read things about myself  that I didn't like  that actually rang true.  I'm not a blind idiot  when it comes to criticism. 
[03:01:30]  There are things I do on the show.  Too many age jokes.  Too many.  Believe me.  I know that there are things  that are weaknesses as a performer.  And sometimes sites point those out  by breaking your balls about them.  Yeah.  When you know it's coming from a shitty place  and obviously people just don't dig you.  Well then.  Alright.  Then why are you feeling the show?  That's what I don't get.  I mean.  It's very hard for anyone to not like me.  As for the third year in a row  I was voted sweetest boy in studio.  Oh.  By the way.  Someone from their cell phone  just writes Mayor Menino guys.  Oh.  Oh.  That's right. 
[03:02:00]  On a fucking station  where we were playing  rock music and goofing every day.  Dick jokes and rock and roll.  We said that the mayor was dead  in such a way  that it wasn't it.  Listen to the fucking recording of that  by the way.  Listen to that show.  Larry from Maryland.  It was funny when you did that  to Menino and his family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First of all  Menino's family wasn't  listening to our show.  It was a kids fucking rock show 
[03:02:30]  that we did in Boston.  Secondly.  Listen to the  Did you listen to the fucking mayor show?  That April Fool's thing?  It was so obviously  an April Fool's joke.  Plus the difference is  we weren't friends with Mayor Menino.  Yeah.  We weren't friends with Mayor Menino.  We weren't a fan show of Mayor Menino.  The point it's trying to make is like  And their family wasn't fucking listening.  And it wasn't  it was presented in a way  that it was a joke.  This was presented  as if I was in the fucking hospital.  And if you think  Carvin 
[03:03:00]  who's this member  that goofing on my girlfriend  calling her lobster girl  from fucking eight years ago  is going to make a difference  that is such old fucking news  that that doesn't bother me.  It bothered me for the first two years.  I'll be honest with you.  It bothered me.  We've been together  eight fucking years.  Do you think that bothers me?  Do you think I wanted a girlfriend  that cooks  and that's why we were together?  Jesus Christ.  Get a hint.  She's great in bed. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  What do you think?  Jesus Christ.  Ooh, I like it.  So they try  they're like trying  to fucking bother me.  It doesn't bother me.  What bothers me  is your arrogance.  That's what bothers me.  The content  say whatever  the fuck you want anymore.  I got no problem  with anything you print  because the site  is going to be mine.  I'm buying you.  I'm fucking  buying your site.  And there's nothing 
[03:04:00]  you can do about it  because it's my fucking name.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, motherfucker.  Have your fun.  Print whatever  the fuck you want  on there.  My site.  Gay porno.  Enjoy it.  Ass caves.  Ass caves  and fat black cock.  Nice.  That's what's going to be  on the fucking site.  And pictures of  diseased cocks.  Diseased cock.  Diseased cock.  But wait a minute.  Write it down.  Ass caves  and fat black cocks. 
[03:04:30]  That is a fucking name  of my new CD.  Oh, you fucking rip off.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Ba-da-da-dee-dee-dee-doo.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Ahem.  Call my agent.  Check on this.  He's not up.  Calling his cell phone.  He is.  He better fucking be up.  No, he's not because  there's daylight.  That fucking ghoul.  Yeah, that's true.  He's in a coffin  of his home country dirt.  His home country dirt.  All right, look.  The people outside  are a little sad.  Go ahead.  Feast your eyes on that,  you bunch of queers.  Show him your butt. 
[03:05:00]  Well, that would have been  nice if we had the reaction.  That's all right.  They didn't know.  I just improv that.  They're improv.  That is good.  Go ahead, you couple of hot chicks  and you bunch of queers.  Enjoy.  We have a big audience  in here.  Flea, you're fucking next.  I know.  No, Flea doesn't do anything.  No, Flea's a good boy.  No one likes Flea.  Voice message system.  Of course.  Bob Eatman is sleeping.  It's L.A., dude.  It's 7.09 o'clock.  Bob's a weenie.  Hold on.  Let me leave my message. 
[03:05:30]  Uh-huh.  Waiting for the beep.  Of course.  There's the beep.  Hi, Bob.  It's Anthony.  Remember the message board  that we were discussing  about getting?  We need that to go ahead.  A-S-A-P.  Money is no object.  That's what I say.  I need that sight immediately.  Hey, you cut me off, you bitch.  But I think after the money  is no object,  that Jewish gentleman  will do everything it takes. 
[03:06:00]  His phone actually jumped for joy.  By the way,  since we're all leaving messages  for people,  Yeah.  Someone's girlfriend  is about to get  her asshole chewed out.  Mine.  How'd your papers come back?  What?  How'd your papers come back?  Something scribbled out  with a negative written over it.  Oh, shit.  Hold on a second.  We're all getting  some fucking business  taken care of.  Business.  Somebody's girlfriend  is getting fucking chewed out  because you guys  fucking taking care 
[03:06:30]  of your business,  I'll take care of my business.  You call the agent,  I call the broad.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm just babbling  until her phone fucking picks up.  She's not going to pick up.  No, I know,  but the machine,  well, I'm holding my cock right now  into shave.  Yeah, okay, yeah.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Hi, this is your boyfriend.  You all bring up  the Mayor Menino thing.  Not even getting it.  I'm leaving a message  for my girl.  Oh, go ahead.  We're all taking care of business.  This is my,  this is your boyfriend.  Stop sleeping with Negroes!  Oh, wait, I'm sorry,  this is your son. 
[03:07:00]  You see the way  I took that bomb  when I turned it around?  You turned it around.  Not as bad as it could have been,  right, guys?  Right around.  Look at that,  they're clapping and laughing.  Go ahead, drink it in.  Drink in the ass.  All right.  Well, there's still nobody  out there with that mic.  Yeah, they reacted nicely.  How about we try it a third time  so we can get the reaction  on the air?  All right.  All right, let's do that.  How about anybody?  Is the mic done?  Is there anybody out there  with the mic?  No?  You don't have to do that.  I don't care that they're  printing Menino stuff. 
[03:07:30]  Most of them now  are printing,  hey, the Menino thing.  The Menino thing.  Doesn't matter.  Call me a fucking hypocrite.  Doesn't matter.  I've already explained  the point on the mayor thing.  The site will be mine.  That's all there is to it.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  Have a field day.  Have a fucking field day.  All right.  And I'm not even  showing my ass.  Jimmy's ass is nice.  Nah, they've been spoiled.  Would you like to see 
[03:08:00]  Jimmy's ass again?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  All right.  That's two guys.  That's not very enthusiastic.  Push it right up  against the glass for them.  Oh, wait a minute.  All right.  Oh, see?  The girl said come on.  Yeah.  I wish I could fucking  turtle a log out right now.  I would have done that for you.  I would have shit  against the window  and would have laughed.  My fucking XM  in my car expired.  I'd like to ask Mr. Wickland  to please turn that on again.  Thank you.  It did.  It's been a year.  I love it. 
[03:08:30]  People don't get  I'm just told  what am I saying?  People don't get  the Menino comparison.  No, not at all.  We weren't in  the good graces  of the mayor.  It's not like he was  supposedly a friend.  Or fan.  Or fan.  Or anything else.  All right.  Why is Poe babbling?  What could he possibly  be babbling about?  Yeah, where's Poe?  What are you babbling about?  Where is he?  He's on the phone?  Tell him to go somewhere else. 
[03:09:00]  We decided to mic  our studio audience today.  Yeah.  I didn't know she was five.  I was.  Good.  I'm a pedophile joke.  Shock.  I have a fastball.  It's all I throw.  How about a fucking knuckle  once in a while?  Or a curve?  Fastball down the middle.  Ah.  We can turn the mic off  outside.  Not that we don't  want to hear from you  but we'd like somebody  to be monitoring it  because...  Wait, you guys clap.  I've got to figure out  what mic to turn off.  All right, I got it.  Ah, that's the one. 
[03:09:30]  All right, I got it.  Hi, Poe.  Now, see, this is what we do  and then I turn it on  when I want it.  Pat from...  And then you're not to worry.  Pat from Munaki posting.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was looking for  Big Black Cox.  I'll come back later.  Big Black Cox.  Attaboy.  That's what's going to be there.  Stay tuned.  All right, can we get  some work done here today?  No, actually,  that was some fine work.  Oh, of course.  Needed to be said.  It needed to be said.  Enough. 
[03:10:00]  We didn't even attempt  a April Fool's joke.  We haven't attempted one  since the big day.  It hasn't been on the air.  They haven't allowed us  on the air since April Fool's.  Yeah, we were trying  to figure that out today.  I don't think we've done  an April Fool's Day show  since the mayor thing.  I don't think we have.  We might have once.  If we had it all,  I think we did once  and we just replayed  getting fired.  But went over the audio  and stuff  and all the news reports.  Yeah, that's right.  Other than that,  they've kept us off the air.  I got a good one  with my girlfriend yesterday.  I kept getting her  with April Fool's stuff.  What'd you do, Jim? 
[03:10:30]  I was like,  ah, man, the milk,  I left it out.  It's not good.  She's like, really?  I'm like, April Fool's.  We had a really fun day.  Oh, I bet she laughed.  Oh, she did.  She did.  I just stay out of that.  Oh, I got her so good,  by the way.  I got her so good.  Another one?  My girlfriend  was the cutest thing.  Her head was back  over the bed  and I was kind of  mouth-fucking her.  And I put my balls  in her face.  I said, I'm going to come  and she went, okay.  And I shit all over  her nose and eyes. 
[03:11:00]  April Fool's.  April Fool's.  Of course,  you got to yell,  April Fool's.  Well, then it's just  twisted, as long as  you say April Fool's.  That was funny.  Oh, I got her.  Did I tell you  how good I got her?  No, I'm not.  Oh, what'd you do?  I handed her flowers  and I said a little  something for you  and when she went,  thank you.  And before she got  thank you out,  I kicked her in a cunt.  Give her a good boot  right for the cunt.  Yeah, we laughed.  And it was okay  because you said,  April Fool's.  Yeah, it makes it  all good.  It was like,  April Fool's. 
[03:11:30]  That would be  the pulling out  of the said cunt.  Yes, yes, yes,  from the knee.  I didn't know  you could do sound effects.  What am I talking about?  It's the one you love, Jimmy.  I do.  I do love her, too.  Yeah.  And you know  what else I love,  by the way?  Happy Typing Girl.  Who doesn't?  Because she made that...  I have to think.  What happened?  I was in a panic  about my...  I got my picture  Friday night.  Geezer was so drunk  I had to hold him up.  Eddie Trunk passed him to me 
[03:12:00]  and said,  could you hold him?  How fucking thrilled  were you  to be holding up  a drunk geezer?  You don't understand.  It was for real  holding him up.  Yeah.  Like, if I would have  let him go,  he would have...  If someone could bring me  my envelopes,  I'll show you the picture.  He fucking...  Because he was yelling  on the air.  He was just fucking  singing on the air  and yelling,  the Rock and Roll Hall  of Fame sucks!  He was so loaded.  And so Eddie's like,  you gotta hold him.  So for the picture,  I'm like,  I gotta hold...  I'm holding Geezer Butler  and I'm like, 
[03:12:30]  it's okay, Geezer.  It's okay.  Just one more.  Just one more.  And you can see  his little hand.  He has the cutest  little hands.  They're like,  in like a little kid  that did something naughty.  He's holding his hand  clenched like a bad boy.  Or a drunk.  Or someone who's  liquored up.  So I got the photo taken  and I had to panic  to get it done.  So Debbie made it happen  at Dugall Photo  on 23rd Street.  So I have to thank  those guys.  A fucking beautiful thing  they did for me  and it is so appreciated.  They're the best place  in the city  for any type of photograph. 
[03:13:00]  They didn't ask me  to plug them.  You know what?  I don't like those guys.  Oh.  Opie, they're fantastic.  You know why  you don't like them?  Because they're too good.  I saw Happy Typing Girl  Friday at Fez's  birthday party  at Bar 9.  She was happy.  She was indeed a girl.  And she was typing.  And she was typing  on her phone.  Yeah.  She's constantly online.  Well, if your name's  Happy Typing Girl,  you better be typing  every time people see me.  And happy.  And you better be happy.  And, of course, a girl.  Oh, look at Vince  getting his head shaved. 
[03:13:30]  He's screaming.  They're not even  doing it nicely.  Boy, this time around  I thought there was  going to be a real surprise.  Oh my God.  It's Dr. Evil.  Oh, he looks...  Vince looks like Dr. Evil.  He looks awful  without hair.  Oh, Jesus.  Let me see.  Is that a cool shot?  Wow.  Let me see.  Oh, my...  Show over.  That's Eddie Chunk  fucking passing.  No.  Don't.  Oh, don't.  Oh, don't.  Do you have an extra one?  No, I don't.  Don't even crease it. 
[03:14:00]  You guys want to see  this out there?  No.  They're hanging you on.  Don't.  Don't go for pure pressure.  That's too predictable.  I'm trying to be  less predictable.  There you go.  There's your picture back.  It's a good one, though, right?  It's all right.  Come on.  It's all right.  Eddie's holding him up.  Look at Jimmy.  In your world,  it's everything.  In mine, it's like,  yeah, it's a cool picture,  I guess.  You know?  Where is, by the way...  What?  This fucking Dugald,  this could work.  Look at the difference  in the quality of these pictures.  Let me see.  This one's from another place.  That one's from Dugald.  Yeah, I don't feel those people. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, stop it.  They're lovely.  That's two different photographs.  I'm not feeling those people.  Look at the color in one  and the color in the other.  I'm going to take my wedding photos  somewhere else.  That's what?  Wedding photos?  Wedding photos?  What are you talking about?  Are you announcing something?  This is what a fucking...  This is what a self-centered ass  I am when I'm talking about.  I didn't even catch wedding.  I'm thinking,  why would you take them  anywhere else,  Dugald?  It's good.  I'll take my nude photos  somewhere else.  I want clarity. 
[03:15:00]  Nothing.  Jamie in Pennsylvania,  what's up?  I don't want to see  the Jersey guys wrong.  You guys suck.  Did he just say  the Jersey guys wrong?  Dude.  Wow.  Wow.  Let me say something right now.  If you want to talk  about the Jersey guys,  we'll let you go on  and on and on  and on and on  and on and on  about them.  They fucking blow.  That's why we don't  pay attention to them. 
[03:15:30]  The...  Let's go to Jeff  in Charlotte.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, OB.  Good morning,  Anthony.  Jimmy.  Good evening.  Hola.  How are you doing?  Hello, Frank.  What's up, Jeff?  The quality of the show,  you guys are white hot.  You've had guests  on Friday,  today.  Keep it up.  It's a great streak.  Was the Sabbath interview okay?  I felt bad  because the mics weren't working  and Oprah's angry.  Did it come off all right?  I mean, if not, 
[03:16:00]  our apologies.  No, you're my apologies.  You guys pulled it off.  I was just out of my mind  pissed that the mics  weren't working  so I couldn't think.  I wanted to do better  but Tony couldn't talk  because I was really embarrassed.  Jeff, thank you.  OB, you are my hero.  Really?  Yes.  My cell phone ringtone  is dedicated to you.  What?  Wait.  I'm on your ringtone?  Here you go.  Hold on.  All right, let's hear this.  Ha!  Fuck, he was too fast for me.  That's a good one, actually.  The fucking obnoxious guy laugh. 
[03:16:30]  That is one.  I would put it on my phone.  If you want to pay me,  you can have it.  Give me a dollar.  Can you put the obnoxious guy laugh  on there right now?  Give me a couple dollars.  I'll give it to you.  Oh, I don't know OPI.  Actually, your voice is on mine  so it's only fair.  You're fucking...  Dude, yeah, Danny,  get over here.  Take that fucking thing  off my phone.  I'm handing Travis  my cell phone  and he's going to give it to Danny  and they're going to put  ringtones on it.  I got kiddie porn  on my computer  is getting me in way  too much trouble.  I'm done with that. 
[03:17:00]  No, no, no.  I hope you got to keep that.  No, I'm done.  And by the way,  take that faggoty thing off  after a text message.  You go...  Sounds like a fucking...  I'm eating pussy underwater.  Take that off.  I don't want any noises.  I'm having these like really...  I'm having like these  important meetings  with florists  and photographers  and all of a sudden...  The kiddie porn  on my computer thing  starts screaming  at the people.  Why are you having  meetings with florists?  Or flowerists.  No, no, no.  You're right.  Florists is correct. 
[03:17:30]  I know I was right.  I was just fucking with you.  But why are you having  meetings with...  Yes, what are you doing?  Find out why  this is the most listened  to FM talk show  in the country.  That's what the Jersey  guy's website says.  The most listened to  FM talk show  in the country?  In the country?  Are you fucking kidding me?  I think that's  a bunch of bunk.  What?  All right.  Should we break  and regroup  and then continue?  You guys having  a good time out there?  That means we're 
[03:18:00]  doing something, I guess.  Bad smell, bad language  and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show  I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love  doing this radio show.  Right?  Okay, terrific.  Time to put your mouth  where our balls are.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Get her over the head  with a shovel.  If you did that,  I would make love  to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news  from O&A are the same people  who watched Sesame Street 
[03:18:30]  until they were 12.  Yes, precisely.  Guys talk about  nasty stuff like this  all the time.  Sit down and put on  your laughing hats  because here comes  a home run.  It's the Opie and Anthony  show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I was reading about  the latest Guns N' Roses CD  and it's been postponed again. 
[03:19:00]  It was supposed to be  out March 6th.  Oh, now they're saying  they're mixing it down  or something.  Blah, blah, blah.  They're so done.  I think it's Axl's  joke to the world.  I think he's going to  just never put this thing out  and that's what he's  going to be known for.  For the guy that never  put out the album  that he said he was  going to put out.  They're done.  No one's working.  No one's getting  rave reviews as the new  well, they're not  Stone Temple Pilots anymore.  What are they called there?  The band with Slash  and Scott Weiland 
[03:19:30]  and Velvet Revolver.  Velvet Revolver, yeah.  Yeah, there's a nice buzz  on their latest CD  that's coming out soon.  Another month, I believe.  I don't know why I'm  talking.  Who gives a shit?  All right, here we go.  Imagine a patch for women  meant to give a boost  of testosterone  and a lift to your sex life.  It's called Intrinza  and it's designed  for post-menopausal women  like Rosalind Washington.  She participated in a U.S. trial  on the Intrinza patch  and says it helped. 
[03:20:00]  There was a noticeable  increase in, you know,  my sexual desire.  Just physically and mentally,  I just felt great.  Yuck.  Yuck.  It's a patch for  post-menopausal women.  Ew.  And it works.  It boosts interest  in sex  for older women.  Do they really need it  or want it?  They don't want that.  This is a reason  God dries that area up.  Yep.  The only patch  should be one  that goes right over the hole. 
[03:20:30]  That's it.  Done.  I'm shutting it down.  Like a pirate.  Shut systems down.  After a certain age,  women should be forced  to just sit on the coffee table  and you throw loose change  and perhaps raise a desk  into their cunts.  It's a candy dish  you use it as.  Fucking throw paperclips in it.  Old powder smelling candy dish.  But the FDA  is not going to approve  this patch.  No?  Yeah, there's a problem.  The panel raised concerns  that giving post-menopausal women 
[03:21:00]  certain types of hormones,  including testosterone,  could lead to higher rates  of heart disease  and cancer.  And because Intrinza  is designed to help patients  with sexual problems,  the FDA was concerned  about other women  using it to enhance  their sex lives  when they may not  need the drug.  Mmm.  Mmm.  I don't know.  All right.  Mmm.  We don't need to do  20 minutes on that, do we?  I don't think so.  We don't need a minute on it.  I think we're learning  to cut certain things short. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, we're certainly trying.  All right.  Why meetings with florists?  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  You're having meetings  with florists.  I don't know why.  What happened?  Interesting.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  Meetings with florists.  Stop getting weird, man.  I just want to know  if something's going on.  I want to be on the inn.  I don't know.  April Fool's prank.  18 students fed  laxative in donuts.  These kids rock middle school  in Long Island, right?  You guys heard about this?  No. 
[03:22:00]  See, that's why we're here for you.  See, this is what we do.  We make your lives  more interesting.  Let's be honest.  Agree or disagree?  Agree.  Of course.  Some long...  What happened to the crowd,  by the way?  Now it sounds like  a really lame...  Yeah.  ...to the audience.  It's like the fucking  Joe Franklin show.  We don't...  We don't...  We don't rate.  I guess it was all  the Yankee fans  getting the early trains  uptown?  Yeah, they're fags.  They're fags?  Fucking A, they're fags.  We had a bunch of Yankee fans. 
[03:22:30]  That's why we had  such a huge crowd  for the walkover.  They're going to the game.  They decide to stop by  and now they've got to go drink  before the game.  It's 10.30.  The game is at 1 o'clock.  They've got to get  some drinking in.  You've got to get  some drinking in.  They'll be at 11.  They'll be there  two hours early.  It's the home opener.  The drinking is to  distract you from  the neighborhood  you're going to.  By the way,  I've got to start  being nicer to people  because I have tickets  behind home plate today  and I couldn't find  one person to go with me.  And I'm like,  wow, people just hate me.  I don't want to  fucking a little hand  right next to you  going up.  No, I was talking  about my family. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, okay.  They hate me.  I'm sure these  groveling asses  you can get to go anywhere.  One after another,  no, no, no, no, no.  So I went to bed  depressed last night.  Why?  That's the district  they don't want to go with you.  It's hard on a weekday.  No, they don't want to go.  No.  I also have season tickets  to the Islanders.  I can't get my family  to go ever.  Let me ask you though,  how?  I took Club Soda Kenny  and his son  this past Saturday.  That's nice.  It was very nice.  But I didn't buy  four tickets for him.  I was going to go  to the game today.  A little uncomfortable, right? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Sad.  You guys all couples out there?  We got couples?  What's going on?  Who fucks who?  You fuck all?  Oh, wow.  Oh, this girl.  Just like went around  the room pointing.  Who's your boyfriend?  That's my husband.  Husband?  Hold on.  Fan's not doing it, Mike.  But is anyone else  involved in you two?  Nah, just us.  Maybe not here.  Somewhere else, maybe?  Nah, not that I know of.  No.  What's the wildest thing  you guys have done? 
[03:24:00]  Oh, we are so boring.  Really?  Um, yeah.  I'm just fine.  Jeez.  I don't know.  We are dull and boring,  I guess.  We really are.  Did you ever put anything  in your hiney, sir?  Um, no.  I tried.  What did you try to put  in his hiney?  Just my finger.  You won't take a finger?  You won't take it.  Who'd you vote for?  Gorbachev?  He is Russian.  Russian?  Yeah.  Dude, you don't know  what you're missing.  A little finger 
[03:24:30]  goes a long way.  My father told me  that when I was a boy  and then showed me.  Well, other little things  don't go very...  Never mind.  How about the girl  over there?  I gotta talk to the girl  over there  because she's by herself.  She's in a business suit.  What did she have to say?  I'm here for an interview  for an internship.  With us?  Congratulations.  You're hired.  With us?  Wow.  Oh, boy.  No one has told her the rule.  Jimmy, why don't you  tell her the rule?  There's a rule we have  on the Opie and Anthony show.  You gotta wear jeans.  Yes, and you have to be  willing to do things 
[03:25:00]  you might not normally  be willing to do  with out-of-shape men  than you're not normally...  Not that rule.  No.  Look, she's dressed all smart  in business life.  No rule.  We typically only have  male interns.  We love women.  We love girls.  But we're afraid...  Not we.  Jimmy used to fuck  all female interns.  Yes.  Not in traditional  fucking, though.  Just a mind fuck. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, just a mind game, man.  No, we typically only  have males because  we're so afraid  with just the show content  and occasionally  naked girls or people  fucking that we're  gonna get sued  for some type of  harassment with  a human resources issue.  But you wouldn't  do that, right?  Maybe we can make  an exception.  What are you all about?  Eh, I'm okay.  You wouldn't have to  sleep with us.  We're kidding.  We don't do that.  I know.  Why should we hire you  as an intern  for the Opie and Anthony  program?  Wow, that's a really  good question.  I am fun, outgoing, 
[03:26:00]  and anything goes.  Oh.  That's lovely.  What's your name?  Renee.  How old are you?  23.  I thought I met you  10 years ago.  And you're in school  for communications?  I went to  Connecticut School  of Broadcasting.  Ah.  There you go.  CSB graduate, huh?  Yeah, all the way.  Yeah, you got a nice  voice, got a good  radio voice.  Thank you.  What's your goal?  Voiceovers.  Okay.  Well, I don't think  you'll do very well 
[03:26:30]  at all.  The way you have to  do it with voiceovers.  You have to talk  like this.  Yes.  Speak so well  that the speaking spell  is embarrassed  to talk around you.  So, but what,  what,  let me think,  what qualifies you  for like an internship  with the Opie  and Anthony show?  Oh, wow.  I love you guys.  I love the show.  Oh, God.  What?  Did you turn the mic off?  Yeah, of course I did.  Shut her off.  Well, I, I, 
[03:27:00]  I don't know.  Are we pretty airtight?  No, I don't want  that one either.  Get rid of that one.  Which one's that?  I don't want to say.  Oh, Opie.  Give me,  surprise me with  something nice  that I can play  when I'm writing  big checks  for people I don't know.  Thank you.  I want an obnoxious guy  laugh as my ringer.  I'd better be.  That's how I get tough.  Oh, I heard a best of  the other day.  It was from N.E.W.  And you doing the  to somebody  so many times 
[03:27:30]  and they didn't get it.  They thought you were  actually laughing.  Laughing, really?  Oh, it was so embarrassing.  Who was it, though?  Oh, I forgot.  Shit.  It was last week sometime.  It was some real bad guest  came in  trying to  shill something.  Yeah, I keep thinking  it's Steve the Whistler  but it wasn't him.  Steve the Whistler  is the greatest moment.  I thought he was funny.  In Opie and Anthony history,  it's right up there.  Oh, yeah.  How ridiculously uncomfortable  it was for everybody.  All right, 
[03:28:00]  what else do you want  to do today?  Starting his dopey song.  Over and over again?  Yeah.  God damn.  I have to say,  maybe it's time  that we had  a female intern.  You think we're ready for it?  Why not?  We don't do anything crazy.  I mean...  Ma'am, that means  you're not ugly.  But I mean, really,  I mean, she seems  like a go-getter.  She seems like  she has personality.  Works for Ron and Fez.  I mean, we're not...  We don't have people  fucking in the studio. 
[03:28:30]  We don't have anything  crazy going on  other than language content  and me occasionally  gassing and showing my ass.  I don't take my dick out  but I do show my honey  once in a while.  And if she can adapt  to farts,  fucking she can do anything.  You have to farts?  Oh, you can?  Yeah, because Jimmy's...  The interns aren't allowed  to get close enough  to smell your farts.  Isn't it amazing  we've talked to her  more than we have  to Jeremy  or the other interns?  Jeremy?  You even know his name?  Which one is that?  Yeah, well, Jeremy, I know.  I actually don't know that.  I have no idea.  From what?  Atlanta.  He's a nice guy  from the South.  He's a good boy.  All right. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, we'll decide on that.  These...  The laxatives  in the donuts,  have you heard this story?  Oh, yes.  This is great.  Some Long Island...  Oh, they're 8th graders.  I heard it was like  5th graders.  8th graders apparently  got an early start  on April Fool's Day  pranks on Friday  when they handed out  donuts laced with  laxatives to classmates,  school officials said.  We gotta do this  in one of our appearances.  This shit would always  happen in school.  Who the fuck would eat  something that kids  brought in  on April Fool's Day?  I don't know.  What the...  What are you, insane? 
[03:29:30]  There were no apparent  injuries.  Injuries?  How do you get injured?  You should have  cloppered your ass.  But do you actually  get injured?  Yes, because you're  running to the toilet,  you trip and crack  your skull on the porcelain.  Wow.  By the sixth ass wiping,  though.  Yeah, I don't like  this ass going to hurt.  I don't mind it.  I've just got nothing  but base hits.  It's my own fault.  I'm not feeling confident  in any of these duds.  You realize, like...  What?  I haven't felt confident  with any of these.  You know what I'm doing?  I'm firing little singles,  and the only reason  I'm getting them  is because the first base 
[03:30:00]  was not on a line.  If he was,  I would have been  fucking unceremoniously  tagged out on every one of them.  I'm sneaking them by  because Ann's distracted.  Ope's got a body  just built for photography.  Oh, my God.  That's a little uncomfortable.  So what?  You do?  Again, I'll put a big deal.  Let's get it out  in the open already.  You want to be photographed naked?  I'm all for it.  That's not even  to be a homosexual.  You fucking...  She should be taking  your picture naked.  You've worked for it.  They were artistic photos.  I know.  I'm sure they were.  For a photography class.  I bet your leg was up  on the bench on one 
[03:30:30]  and your bag was shown  on the bottom.  Very sexy.  It looked like  a flask of vodka.  A vodka.  All right.  What do we got here?  So no apparent injuries,  although ambulances  were dispatched  to the middle school  as a precaution.  Approximately 18 students  shit their brains out.  The story says?  Yeah, right there.  Oh, yeah.  Although the students  are feeling well,  the school is taking  precautionary measures  and police were investigating 
[03:31:00]  and parents were  were been formed.  What?  Is this a real story?  Police were investigating  and parents were been formed.  Informed about the situation.  Police were investigating  and parents were been informed.  Interesting.  Wouldn't it be  were being informed?  Yeah.  Parents had the option.  Classes proceeded as usual,  but parents were given  the option to pick up  their children.  The children of the district  said it would take  appropriate disciplinary actions. 
[03:31:30]  That would always happen  in school, though.  Somebody would...  I think everybody's got  a story about  somebody slipping something  into the shop teacher's coffee.  That's what happened  where we were.  Really?  Someone put mescaline  into the shop teacher,  Mr. Shanley.  Put it into his coffee.  Was he an old dude?  He wasn't a kid.  That's for sure.  And they took him out  in an ambulance.  Oh, wow.  Because he didn't know  what was going on.  He thought he was having  a stroke or something. 
[03:32:00]  Holy shit.  You know, the guy all of a sudden...  If you were just walking around  and you started feeling  the effects of mescaline,  you would think something  was fucked up with your brain,  that's for sure.  Blood clot or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Did David Cashwood do it?  Yeah.  How'd they catch him?  They always do.  Somebody rats.  There's always a rat in school.  What happened to him?  You can never do something...  I don't remember  what happened to him,  but he was one of those  troublemaker kids  that you could give an M82  and he would be the guy  that flushed it down the toilet.  Shit like that.  Like, you give him anything  and he'd go,  okay, I'll do it. 
[03:32:30]  Dude, take the sledgehammer  and just bang it  against this wall.  Okay.  I don't want to, you know,  blow up the guy's spot,  but actually I should give him  a plug if someone remembers.  I saw Bob Saget on Friday.  He was taping his HBO special  and he had an L.A. comic  and I usually...  L.A. comics.  But he had a bit about, like,  the kid that always took it  too far growing up.  They'd have no boundaries.  I thought it was brilliant  because, you know,  growing up as kids,  they all do crazy shit.  We used to throw rocks  at the neighbor. 
[03:33:00]  Craig Bench.  Craig Bench,  we used to throw rocks  at his neighbor,  but I would always just kind of...  Throw rocks at him?  It was a lady,  an old lady that would, like,  rake her leaves and stuff.  And he's like,  come on, let's go throw rocks  at the old lady.  I'm like, all right.  So I'm involved,  but I'm like...  But I'm not brave.  I was brought up right,  so I'm kind of, like,  lobbing them  and making sure they fall short.  And he's just trying to peg her.  I'm like...  Winging them.  And that's what I knew.  Line drives.  This kid could be a problem.  So when this guy did this bit  on Friday,  I'm like,  oh, is that the truth? 
[03:33:30]  There's always that one kid  we grew up with  that took every prank too far.  Nothing was better  than a good dirt bomb fight  with a neighbor, like,  behind you.  Right.  You had a fence.  Same thing.  And that was always cool.  But like you said,  you'd always get  go-too-far guy,  and he would have rocks.  He would go with rocks  because he can't find  any more dirt bombs.  Can't find any more dirt bombs.  Dirt bombs are great.  They'd be...  Or they'd blow up  and make smoke.  Or if you were the guy  throwing rocks,  once again,  you'd, like,  bounce them in front  or, you know,  throw them far over their head.  But sure, yeah,  there was always the guy  that said,  fuck that, man. 
[03:34:00]  We had a six-foot stockade fence  in Northport  many, many years ago.  And we had a good  dirt bomb fight  with the neighbor going on.  And you'd lob them  over the fence.  You couldn't see each other.  It was like, you know,  USA and Soviet Union  launching missiles.  Right, right.  Couldn't see each other.  But you'd just lob enough  and with enough of a spread  put on them.  And sometimes you'd hear,  like, hey, ow!  Or, you know,  oh, you got me.  And dirt bombs would come  over the other end.  And then one of my friends  just grabs a rock.  Right.  And he's hit over the fence. 
[03:34:30]  And he'd just be like,  wah!  And this blood-curdling scream.  And everyone runs inside.  When I was growing up,  they were, you know,  putting in all the developments  in Centerport.  And so it was fun as kids  to, like,  when they weren't there,  to run through the developments  and run through the houses  that are being built.  And for me,  that was risky enough.  Same thing,  another kid  that wasn't good enough  for him.  Take it too far, guy.  He's, like,  destroying the toilets  with his boot  and breaking windows. 
[03:35:00]  I'm like,  what are you doing, man?  What are you going to do this for?  Right.  It's scary enough  that we're, like,  trespassing  and just checking out the houses  as they're being built,  you know?  But it was always  take it too far, guy.  Fire guy.  It was like,  we'd have a nice little  campfire going in the woods  hanging out  and someone always had to,  like,  throw a can of spray paint  in there.  You'd have to spray paint  and the lighter  and make a little  flamethrower thing with it,  which is dangerous enough.  But then he'd have to  take the can  and throw it  into the fire. 
[03:35:30]  So now you're like,  run for your life.  This thing's going to go off  like a bomb,  shrapnel all over the place.  And he's laughing.  I hate to admit  I was that guy.  I took it too far  with the fires.  What?  Oh, yeah.  We would start little ones  and I was like,  let's see what happens  if you just, you know,  start that pile of leaves  on fire over there.  We talked about that before.  I tried stomping out a fire  and my brother held my foot  and it took over a whole hill.  Burnt the whole hill down.  That's when I blamed it  on the Negroes. 
[03:36:00]  It burnt down the whole hill,  Beauty's Hill,  and ran to the house  across the street  and asked them for a hose.  Yeah.  And they see this  blazing inferno outside  so the fire trucks show up  and I was a little kid.  I was in kindergarten  and a fireman picked me up  and he goes,  did you see who did this?  And I said,  it was two Negroes.  God, you learned well  from your parents.  I don't know why I said that.  I was in kindergarten.  How would I?  Anthony, do you know?  Honest to God,  I got an email  from a guy named Jerry  who I grew up with 
[03:36:30]  and I have no memory of this  and he said to me,  do you remember the time  we got in trouble  because we started that fire  and when we got in trouble  we blamed it on black kids?  What is that?  I have no idea.  I don't know what,  I'm really trying to get a grasp on,  was it my parents  or was it like  the little things I saw  on the news  because they were always  back then showing  like riots and stuff?  Nah, it was your parents.  Was it?  They couldn't get you  a good seat at the circus  but they taught you racism. 
[03:37:00]  They taught me racism?  By kindergarten though?  You got the front seat  in racism class.  Maybe you're in the back row  of the garden  for the circus but...  That's probably how  his father explained it to him.  Instead of saying  I'm drinking too much,  Anthony went,  how can we cancel our bride?  His father went,  niggers.  Just blamed it on.  I really don't,  how could you  by the age of,  what's kindergarten?  Six?  Fourteen in some neighborhoods.  Six years,  five?  That was funny.  That's racist.  It was funny. 
[03:37:30]  I got a little something for that.  I agree.  By, yeah,  like five years old,  how could you get a kid  to like put that together  that black people,  you can blame them  for crimes  and white people  will believe you?  That's too,  like abstract a thought  for a five-year-old  even if the parents  are pounding it  into your head.  I don't get it.  Where does it come from?  Maybe you want to,  maybe instinctively  when blaming someone  you pick someone  that couldn't possibly  be mistaken for you. 
[03:38:00]  Maybe that's the first instinct  and black people  just look so differently.  Maybe it's not a thing  about blacks.  Maybe it's honestly  who did it?  The black kid.  It's completely the opposite.  It exonerates you completely.  Maybe.  That's a good way  to get me out of a jam.  But I mean,  it's possible, right?  It sure sounds like  I was racist  from the time I was five.  Jeez, that's awful.  Where we grew up,  I didn't see a black person  until junior high  except for the one  we took in for a while  like a summer program.  You did?  Yeah, we were part 
[03:38:30]  of that fresh air fund  or whatever the hell is.  Oh, the fresh air fund?  Also, we were at  Robert Moses' beach  with some black thing.  A little black kid  was with you?  And I guess technically  she was my sister  for the summer.  It was very bizarre.  Get a little jungle fever?  Huh?  A little jungle fever for you?  But then to actually interact  on a regular basis,  that didn't happen  until junior high school  and all of a sudden  black people  were walking around my school  and it was like  seeing a panda bear.  I didn't really understand. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, you didn't understand it?  No, I didn't really  have a knowledge  of black people  whatsoever, I realized.  Well, do you ever think  I'm moving back  to Utopia, Long Island?  Utopia.  I'm just kidding,  black people.  I love you.  I really can't get  a grasp on it, though.  I'm really trying  to put myself  in that moment  and think why I said that  because it's weird.  It's a vivid memory for me.  Like, I remember  the fireman was holding me  and he put his hand  down my pants.  He was holding me,  put his little fire helmet 
[03:39:30]  on me,  then he took his hat off.  The fireman  let me kiss his helmet  when she picks me  on the title game.  The helmet.  But I'm trying  to remember  why I said that  and I think it was,  it's not as innocent  as you would put it.  There was something there  that made me say that  that made me think  they'll believe this  more if I say  it was somebody  who was black.  You overheard something.  That's all it is, dude.  You overheard something  from your family?  From my family?  Yeah, probably.  It wasn't the media. 
[03:40:00]  I didn't call them  Moulin Yams  like my family,  so what happened there?  How come I couldn't  say that at five?  It couldn't be the TV.  It couldn't be TV.  We only had three  or four channels  when we were growing up  and it was very,  it was much wider  than it is now.  I swear to you,  I think the news  had something to do with it  because I remember  watching like riots  and burning,  like black people  rioting, looting  and burning  on the news  and I think  that's why I said it.  But it's, 
[03:40:30]  I don't know why  I said it last week.  Last week?  How about this morning?  All right,  let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy, what's up?  Yeah, love you.  Love the show.  Thanks, man.  And I just wanted to,  y'all were talking  about practicing the jokes  because a couple years ago  when I was in high school  I'd heard a couple of kids  had poured a bunch of Viagra  into this English teacher's coffee  and had like an allergic reaction to it  and almost died,  so pretty much it. 
[03:41:00]  How did he almost die?  Pretty much it.  How much Viagra  did you give the guy?  I wasn't sure exactly  how much it was.  I think it was quite a bit,  but he just was allergic  to Viagra  or something in Viagra.  Enough to kill an elephant?  That's usually the,  you know,  how we measure that.  He's listening to himself.  Oh, forget it.  I know.  They love listening to themselves.  Especially on XM,  don't go and listen to yourself.  Finish the call.  Yeah.  We're on a little of a delay  so you can even hear  the end of your phone call. 
[03:41:30]  That's what I did  with the Fezzy phone call.  Oh, you listen on the phone  then you hang up,  you turn your radio on  and you get to listen  to yourself a little.  And then we got to replay  so then you could listen later  and go,  oh, I called in around this time.  I better re-listen.  Happy birthday, Fezzy,  by the way.  I didn't know.  It was Friday.  I didn't know.  I was watching Sabbath Friday  doing gigs Saturday  and just hugging, loving  and fucking on Sunday.  I didn't know.  So happy birthday, Fezzy.  What a great party  over there.  Happy birthday.  Bar 9 we had over there.  Yeah, a lot of fun. 
[03:42:00]  Take it too far guy  from Connecticut.  What's up?  What's up?  Love Jimmy.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Yeah, no problem.  I was the take it too far guy  when I was a kid, man.  I was just always pushing  the envelope for whatever reason.  I know this isn't going to work  for the rest of the country  but we used to stand over 287.  There was an overpass there.  That's where I used to live  and we used to throw rocks.  Yeah, they don't know overpasses  in the rest of the country  so you're correct  with that knowledge, sir.  They don't know where to do it. 
[03:42:30]  They appreciate the help there.  But we used to throw rocks  and watch them bounce off the cars  and of course I went  and picked up like the  double the softball size rock  and launched it  and made a huge mess  and cops started coming around  and we had to run home  and, you know,  I was his bad guy, man  and it just always  got me into fucking trouble.  Right.  And then what happened?  That was pretty much it.  This is my first car crash phone call.  It wasn't worthy of a car crash.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  No.  Thank you, Chris.  I won't even use the energy  to reach over  and point at a button.  That's right.  It was more like a fucking  Cleveland Indians pitcher  boating decapitation.  Just a silent  little dull thud  with a fucking floating hat.  As we limp toward  the finish line today.  Oh, we all limp.  Oh, no.  At 11 o'clock  we're going to do  the Jim Brewer  dirt bombs  and tree forts bit.  Oh.  Very, very good.  All right.  And Bill has the end  of the call to Fezzy  from Friday. 
[03:43:30]  You want to hear this?  Yes.  I miss Jim Brewer, by the way.  Oh, Danny has it?  Somebody has it?  Yeah, this way.  Danny.  All right, let's go.  I love you, Opie.  Thank you.  I love you.  I really, really love you.  He was drunk, too.  If they're calling me,  I've got to go back  down in the basement  for the photo shoot.  All right, off you go.  Take care, buddy.  All right, bye-bye.  Hot shit.  Opie is naked right now  somewhere in this city.  Isn't that just awful?  He meant it.  He did mean it  because he was drunk.  Hot shit.  Hot shit.  That's what we said  all weekend. 
[03:44:00]  Hot shit.  Hot shit.  Opie is naked.  Hot diggity dog.  Somewhere in New York City.  All right.  Line of the day?  No.  Yeah.  No.  No?  Why?  The voting process  is just wrapping up.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  Hope it was to Geezer.  Why would Geezer  get married today?  A couple of good ones.  Don't give it a good one.  A couple of zingers.  Tony might have  had anyone in  been able to hear him.  I'll tell you,  Ronnie's the new, um,  Ronnie's the new 
[03:44:30]  Sinatra, too.  What happened?  You see Ronnie  walk around in appearance  on a fez  at bar nine?  People just like,  he holds court.  He's got like a circle  of people around him  just looking,  glaring at him,  staring into his eyes,  guys, girls.  He's like Jesus.  He just sits there  and...  Jesus with a stogie.  Yeah.  Jesus with a cigar.  And a Coke history.  He's even growing  his hair long  and everything.  By the way, 
[03:45:00]  uh,  the laugh in the background  makes it sound like  an all-in-the-family set.  Opie and Anthony  was taped  before a live studio audience.  Um,  I kind of like  the live studio audience.  I love it.  We're gonna have to do this  for a time.  Unless we have  the dramatic ending,  like on Good Times  when James died,  and then it goes without  the thing,  you just see the credits.  And it used to make  our old TV hum,  so you'd see like  the credits come up.  Bomp.  Meep.  Beep.  Meep.  With no music. 
[03:45:30]  No happy music.  I saw the final episode  of, uh,  The Office,  the English version  over the weekend.  Great, right?  Oh my god,  was it good.  What do you mean  when they're,  when they're,  the last episode.  That was it.  That's how they ended it.  Where the fucking, uh,  when they turn the mic  off for a second.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that fucking great, man?  That was really,  really good.  I can't even watch  the, uh,  the regular Office anymore.  Ever since I've seen  the English version.  Do you, oh,  you see,  at first you said  that you kind of like  I know,  but now I so get  that the other one  did you see,  oh, did you see  the fucking, 
[03:46:00]  the motivational speech  he gave?  It's one of the funniest  things ever put on film.  One of the,  explain to Anthony.  Have you seen this?  Yeah, yeah.  The motivation,  the best part  is because he has  the t-shirt tucked in  and the hat backwards  and he's fucking  going to give a speech  and the pants are pulled up  just a little too high.  He was,  he was recruited  by this organization  to do, you know,  do a motivational speech  for another company  so they don't even know him.  Comes in with his hat  on backwards.  Well, he was getting  all motivated  in like the quote  dressing room.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  And then he plays 
[03:46:30]  dramatic music  when he's leaving  and just jogs  out of the room  and everyone's like  just dumbfounded.  Didn't you love  when he first walks up  and he goes,  get out,  get out,  and he points at the door  and you know  what he's going for  but you're like,  ah.  Explain it further.  You got to bring  everyone on board.  He's trying to motivate  people like in business.  There's a group  of business people  watching him  and he's trying  to have an impact  and all the other  motivational speakers  just gave real sound  business advice  in head-on suits  and stupid Ricky Gervais 
[03:47:00]  gets up there  with his fucking  tucked in t-shirt  and his hat backwards  and he's trying  to like start off  with a bang  so he's trying  to be like  the opposite  and mysterious  so he opens  the door real quick  and he points  and he goes,  get out  and he puts  his hands  on his hips  like they're all  going to be intrigued  but instead  they just look bored  like what is this idiot  doing  and a maid  tries to walk in  a fucking cleaning lady  tries to walk in  and he goes,  get out of here  what are you doing?  What was the point  he was trying to make  with the get out?  I forget now.  Like you're supposed  to go,  whoa,  why does he want us  to get out?  Because he was going,  if you don't have 
[03:47:30]  what it takes  or if you don't want  to just get out  but nobody looked  like they were intrigued  or interested  in his curveball.  He's such a buffoon.  He was a fucking fool  but I liked when he was  groveling about  the redundancy  please don't make  me redundant  that was fucking great  and he's wearing  the,  what was it?  The costume?  Oh,  he had the fucking  wacky emu costume  like he was riding  a big giant bird  like riding an ostrich  and he had a stick  that operated the head 
[03:48:00]  and that's how  he got fired basically.  You don't see that  because he's sitting  behind his deck  at the desk  and he gets up  awkward  he's already  in his costume  because he's supposed  to be sitting on it  so you don't see  the costume  until he stands up  and then he walks out  and he's like  I gotta go make people laugh.  He really thought  he was an entertainer  and the man was  a boob  and he's just  wasn't he fucking  just a great actor?  Oh yeah.  A little fucking  like you see  you think  the thing with the nose  the little things  that smirks 
[03:48:30]  with his  you know  if they want to say  look you've been  a great boss  I mean alright  but fine  but he was always  giving these little  commercials for himself  like well if they want  to stand the grace  that's fine  but it doesn't matter  to me  one of my favorite  characters in history  it was amazing  alright  why don't we get  the line of the day  out of the way  brought to you by  Bodogfight.com  tune in to ION TV  Tuesdays and Saturdays  for our episodes  of Bodog Fights  for all the mixed  martial arts action  you can want  check it out  it's Bodogfight.com  here's the runner up  line of the day  oh I got her  did I tell you
