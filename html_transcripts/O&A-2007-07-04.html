<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a running gag about Anthony's alleged secret love for No Doubt.  This involved a listener game guessing which concert tickets Anthony secretly coveted, interspersed with humorous denials and teasing about his musical tastes (including In Sync and Alanis Morissette).  Numerous listener calls fueled the ribbing, with Ben, their ticket broker, participating.

The show then welcomed Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara from *The Job*.  They discussed their show, including behind-the-scenes anecdotes like a massage scene gone awry.  Leary recounted an awkward encounter with Opie at a Comics Come Home event. The conversation meandered through Leary's hockey, upcoming actors' strikes, and various humorous and off-color stories, including one about a comedian and a sandwich at a charity event and another about a listener's profane sign ambush of a news reporter.  The hosts ended this segment discussing various videos, including one of an elderly woman engaging in sexual activity.

Next, the show focused on two main topics: a discussion about a friend's boat, the River Rose, and a series of bizarre phone calls with a listener named Lynn. The River Rose discussion detailed its themed cruises, particularly a Gay Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise, featuring Ron B. (as Tina Turner) and Miss Mess, with jokes about the boat owner's sexuality and mentions of the website www.divasgamesanddykes.com.

The conversation then shifted to Lynn from Massachusetts, who sent separate letters to Opie and Anthony, claiming to be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey, and addressing Opie as "Daddy."  The ensuing phone call was surreal, filled with incoherent statements, conflicting relationships, personal issues (financial problems, a dog named Rocky), and fabricated details.  A bizarre, argumentative exchange ensued, concluding with the hosts expressing disbelief and frustration.  The segment briefly mentioned Dr. Whitehead, a penis surgeon, being on hold.

A phone interview with Dr. Whitehead followed, detailing his penis enlargement technique using cadaver skin.  The hosts, along with guests Colin Quinn and Jim Norton, engaged in sexually explicit jokes and comments.  The conversation covered average penis size, surgical effects, and other related procedures.  This was interrupted by a heated argument between Anthony and a caller, possibly a limo service provider, about unpaid services and mistreatment, ending abruptly and unresolved.

A heated confrontation with "Limo Ant" followed, involving accusations of backstabbing and a dispute over promotional considerations, ending with Limo Ant's profane departure.  The hosts' disparaging remarks and a caller, Barry, further fueled the profanity-laden discussion. A comedic gambling bit followed.

A lengthy, profanity-laced argument with Irene ensued, concerning the show's politically incorrect humor, treatment of ethnic groups, and "soft porn."  The conversation became highly personal and offensive, focusing on Irene's account of her boyfriend's death in her bathroom.  The argument ended with Irene hanging up repeatedly and the hosts' continued comments.

Another lengthy, highly contentious phone call with Irene followed, filled with insults and sexually aggressive language from the hosts towards Irene.  The conversation revolved around Irene's boyfriend's death and attempts to obtain a party address. Andrew W.K. then appeared as a guest, discussing his feelings about being a recurring guest and his anxieties about the hosts' appreciation.

Barry Williams (Greg Brady) visited the studio. The conversation covered Williams' career, book, movie, and highly inappropriate sexually suggestive jokes about the *Brady Bunch* cast, focusing on Marcia Brady and Robert Reed.  Listener calls included highly vulgar and sexually explicit questions.

A segment focused on Ben Stein's criticism of the show, specifically regarding a perceived anti-Semitic remark ("chew down").  Stein's calls were interspersed with the hosts' responses and offensive ethnic and racial jokes, impersonations of Richard Nixon, and discussions of the "Wow" stunt. A Boston Globe article criticizing "Wow" and a news report of a woman flashing her breasts on the Today Show to promote it were discussed. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson from *Clerks* were briefly in studio.

The show concluded with a discussion of a woman exposing her breasts on a morning show, critiques of her breasts and the promotion, and a negative experience with news reporter Bill Rapley, involving unseen footage suggesting underage girls. A "Where in the World is Matt Lauer?" promotion was discussed. A recounting of a previous show segment featuring a large tumor led to a discussion of the fallout with management, specifically Ken Stevens. A song mocking breast exposure and a bit pretending to interview a rambling Ronald Reagan concluded the show, mentioning the show's website and replays.

We just asked to find people at Sony to help me out for a Christmas present.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the truth, man. 
[00:09:30]  Man, you're not off the hook either.  Going to see No Doubt.  You can wear some suspenders and checkered pants.  He's going to dye his hair.  He's going to put a little purple in it.  Oh, come on.  I'm just going.  Because Gavin might be there.  Come on, man.  All right, Rob.  You're disappointing me, guys.  Oh, come on.  Are you getting pounding on the instant feedback yet?  Rob from Long Island.  Hey, Ant, maybe Lilith Fair will hit town soon.  You better get your Backstreet Boy tickets before all your homo friends get them first. 
[00:10:00]  Anthony, are you looking forward to the Mike and the Mechanics reunion?  It just sucks when you say something.  I guess it's Ant's turn in the barrel today.  Yeah, yeah.  You couldn't take Ben to the side and say, hey, Ben, you know, don't tell anyone, but I really need, you know, No Doubt tickets.  Jerry, what's going on?  I hear Alba might be getting back together.  People are pounding me, you bastards. 
[00:10:30]  Getting severely pounded on this.  What else are they saying on the instant feedback?  Oh, God.  I'm with the fag police.  I want a warrant for Anthony's apartment to search for Liza Minnelli CDs.  I'm just glad it's not my turn today.  I don't think I can handle it today.  Hey, Ant, you going to the No Doubt show with Gay Marco?  No doubt, Anthony's a fag. 
[00:11:00]  You guys suck, man.  All right, you got a cue down, Mark?  Oh, you want a take?  No, I'm going to check it out.  I'm going to see it.  All right, yeah.  What is Nick Carter calling for?  No, it's, I don't think it's that Nick Carter.  I think it's a different Nick Carter.  Oh, I thought it was our buddy in Boston.  No, it's a...  Oh, all right.  Nick.  Hello.  Yeah.  I'd like to invite Anthony down to my special show.  I'm from the Backstreet Boys, and I'd like to show them what I've got playing in my pants.  Great. 
[00:11:30]  I want you sideways.  Okay, very, very funny.  Very good.  Just hysterical.  That was great.  All right, Ant, time's up.  Very good.  You handled yourself quite well there.  Thank you.  I made the mistake of actually trying to explain myself the first couple of minutes.  I realized I was completely insane.  You never explain anything on the show.  You just take it.  Yep.  Going to No Doubt.  All right.  Okay. 
[00:12:00]  That's it.  Okay, then.  Okay.  Okay, good.  Uh-huh.  Going to be looking forward to hearing this song.  Sure.  This thing's living up my eyes.  I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise.  Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?  This world is forcing me to hug your head.  Everybody.  I'm just a girl.  A little lovey.  We deliver keggers. 
[00:12:30]  We deliver keggers.  Vanessa, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Anthony, I like No Doubt, but, you know, I'll get you a George Foreman grill if you go  to see Barbra Streisand with my mom.  Barbra Streisand.  What do you think?  Get out of here.  What are you, insane?  Barbra Streisand.  All righty.  Bye.  All right, bye.  All right, Anthony, let's take a quick break, and we'll be back, okay?  Please.  All right.  Hey, this is Bonnie McFarlane.  And Ridge Voss. 
[00:13:00]  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, these stink.  You're just reading them.  Just read them.  Yeah, but they gotta be good.  Hey.  I was letting you take it from me.  Oh.  Hey.  This.  Oh, no.  Opie and Anthony.  This is very cool, Anthony.  Yeah, look at this.  Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar are in the studio.  Hi, guys.  Oh.  From The Job, which is on ABC, Wednesday nights at 9.30 after Drew Carey. 
[00:13:30]  We're big fans of the show.  We've been talking about it every week.  Yes.  It's only been on two weeks so far, but so far, so good.  Look who Adam brings over.  Look at this.  See?  And I was saying to you guys, and this is the truth, I hope you believe me, that the  funniest episodes are upcoming.  Yeah.  If you like the show, and you thought they were funny for the first two episodes, Adam  will back me up on this.  I think our next four are even funnier.  Mm-hmm.  We always felt that way.  Really?  Yeah, well, because in the pilot, you're working, you gotta get the characters explained and  all that stuff.  Right.  And then by the time, and Elizabeth was kind of a stunt casting thing. 
[00:14:00]  The Liz Hurley episode was hilarious.  It's based on a true story that happened to my character, Mike McNeil, the cop that my  character is based on.  But now, after that, we get into some really insane stuff.  Mm-hmm.  We got the bathroom episode this week.  Bathroom is tomorrow, which features heavily on Lenny Clark, the wonderful Lenny Clark.  And then the week after is Massage, which features Adam Ferrara very heavily.  A massage.  Yankee Cranky?  Yeah.  The Yankee Cranky massage?  Yeah.  Yep.  I got to pick my episode.  The full release massage, as we like to call it.  The full release massage.  Rub and tug. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  What a coincidence.  Is that a true story, too?  Based on your character, Adam, or based on Adam?  Look, I had to do some research.  Yeah.  I heard a research story a few years back.  I think you told it on our show.  I did.  Did I tell you?  You went to the Yankee Cranky shop, right?  The crematorium.  And what happened?  At the point we got where I showed my gratification for the ladies' efforts, she went, whee!  Did she really?  It was like a carnival ride.  It was weird.  That would put me off everything for about a month. 
[00:15:00]  I never went back.  How do you deal with that?  Forget about ever going to see roller coasters or any of that stuff.  No.  I never went back after that.  She went, whee.  Yeah.  She went, whee.  Cute.  And I had to throw the flag on what she was doing with her other finger.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Really?  Was she going there?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  How do they assume you want that?  Believe me, I didn't fill out any forms or anything.  There wasn't a warning shot.  There was nothing.  That's a pretty...  You just look like that kind of guy.  Yeah, really.  That's a tough thing to just think that you want. 
[00:15:30]  No.  I said, there's nothing there for you, dragon lady.  And she said, so sorry.  Turned over and whee.  Hey, we got to back up a little bit.  Lenny Clark.  Lenny Clark.  We were hoping he was going to come into the studio.  And Dennis said that.  No, Lenny is up in Martha's Vineyard recovering.  They zapped his heart.  If you're having a regular heartbeat now, they will actually zap your heart to get the rhythm back.  Jeez.  So Lenny's recovering.  He's fine, though.  The second time he's had it done.  So I go to Dennis.  Is this normal?  He goes, oh, yeah.  Every once in a while, I just got to...  Well, they do.  Lenny is one of those guys that, you know, he likes to say this. 
[00:16:00]  You know, some people have their drinks spread out over a whole lifetime.  Lenny got all his up front, okay?  And he's 47.  That's his birthday.  But in Coke years, he's about 78.  He quit everything about four years ago, and his body is still adjusting, let's say.  You know, the oil levels are being...  All the gauges are being checked.  You can't quit.  That happens all the time.  When you're doing it that long.  We were talking about that.  They're like, you know, Miles Davis, he quit everything, and bang, he was dead like six  months later.  Same thing, you know, Dexter Gordon, the great tenor sax player, and quit drugs and drinking, 
[00:16:30]  and bang, he was dead.  And that was it.  You can't stop once you...  Yeah, that's why Keith Richards knows that.  That's why he keeps going, man, because if he stopped everything tomorrow, it's just  his arms would fall off, and that'll be the end of the whole thing.  I've seen the writing on the wall.  Yeah.  God love him.  Keep going.  Keep Keith going.  That's our new foundation, by the way.  It's a charity.  Keep going.  Keep Keith going.  All right?  Please send your drugs here to the show.  We'll send them on to Keith at an undisclosed location.  Dennis, we've got to bring something up, because you hurt Anthony's feelings.  Yeah, we've got to take care of this now.  Dennis. 
[00:17:00]  I hurt Anthony's feelings.  One of the most embarrassing moments in my life, I believe.  See, we're big fans of yours.  Happened last year.  It wasn't even a year, was it?  It was at the last Comics Come Home.  Comics Come Home.  We have the roots in Boston like you do.  We did the radio show up there for three years.  Here's the story.  Yeah, go ahead.  Here's what happened.  We're in that bar area upstairs before we all go over.  Were you naked?  Not that time.  No.  Okay.  No.  We're in the bar area.  Adam's hanging out with me.  You guys are talking to a press about the TV show and whatnot. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  So, Adam's going to bring me over and introduce me to you.  And you're speaking to some guy from a newspaper or something.  Uh-huh.  So, Adam gets pulled away.  Right.  To talk to another newspaper.  Right.  In that time, you get freed up.  I say, who needs Adam?  I'll go over to Dennis.  I'll say, Dennis, Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm a good friend of Adam Ferraris.  Just, you know, maybe straight, just, hello, how you doing?  Blah, blah, blah.  What happened?  The, probably, and this was weird. 
[00:18:00]  Witnessed by a lot of people, which made it even worse.  We all had to turn around.  Probably the ultimate blow-off I've ever, not only gotten, but seen anyone get in my  life.  You did this.  You went like this.  Yeah, you did.  And you kind of, your hand kind of, I wasn't sure if it was a fake gesture or a shake a  hand or a, like, push me away kind of thing.  Like, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah.  I'd say it was probably a push me away kind of thing.  Was it a push me away kind of thing?  I don't remember, but I'm just assuming.  So, and then, and then I look around and everyone, like, looked at me real quick, but then turned 
[00:18:30]  away really fast, like, oh my God, oh my God, did he get blown off so severe.  And we just crouched way down.  You actually, you lost friends because of the episode.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, it was horrid.  Wow.  I didn't, I didn't just look.  People turned away, they shunned, they did not want to look at the embarrassment that  I had gotten.  I'm glad I could bring that much piece of joy into your life.  That one little brush with fame.  I'm glad that you have that story to tell.  You see, now I have that story.  You have that story to tell.  So when we heard you were coming in, everybody's like, Anthony, if you pussy out and don't tell 
[00:19:00]  him about what happened.  Yeah, because he told the story on the air and he felt kind of bummed.  I was like, oh my God, I got bummed.  And then, you know, I want to get on and trash the show and then my pal's on.  And then it turns out that it's good.  So I just, I was screwed through this whole thing, Dennis.  I got screwed.  You can't win.  He was just looking for an opening.  Hoping the show sucks because then we can, you know, trash it.  Well, you know how those things are.  There's so many, every time you turn around when you're at one of these press things,  especially for a charity, you know, there's some guy that wants to come up and say something. 
[00:19:30]  I was that guy.  Or have you a picture taken with his fat girl friend.  I should have waited for Adam.  You should have waited for Adam.  See?  You had your entree.  Right.  See, because then you're identifiable from across the room.  Hey, he's with a good guy.  Bring him over, you know.  But Dennis, here's the difference.  Anthony had really good pot.  Oh, yeah.  But I don't smoke weed.  Oh, all right.  Neither do I, Opie.  Thanks.  Well, next time.  Crack a beer with you.  Make sure you have Adam with you.  I have to have Adam with you.  Even next time.  Leave the pot home.  Bring me.  Here's the scene. 
[00:20:00]  I'll work it out in my head.  It's like, all right.  So now he's been on the show.  Now he knows me.  I don't need Adam.  Dennis, how you doing?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Son of a bitch.  We've seen that happen, too.  Do you interview me again?  We interview people and we're like, wow, we're pals now, man.  Gotta be.  We'll see him out.  Oh, yeah.  He had such a good time.  Right.  I'm on to the next radio station, kid.  Leave me alone.  Well, I'm sorry that that part of your life was such a crushing blow.  But next year, you'll come up and try again.  The show was good, though, wasn't it?  It was.  It was really good.  Yeah, it was a great show.  Adam was great on that show. 
[00:20:30]  The comics come home, rocked, and the job is really, really good.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to ask Dennis a question and Adam a question.  First of all, Dennis, do you sniff the chair every time Elizabeth Hurley gets up when she  does the show?  That's a really classy thing to ask.  Jesus Christ.  You notice I took the K out.  You put the K in between the A and the S, but I, no, I don't, quite frankly.  Oh, man, you're missing out.  Hey, Adam, which way?  Medium or well done?  Yeah, okay.  He's missing out because he's not sniffing seats.  Mike. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, Adam.  Yeah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Thanks, Mike.  He's doing dice pits now.  Mike's trying to be funny in front of Dennis Larry.  He's gone now.  Yeah.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, Dennis.  Yes.  I just want to say that that show is unbelievable.  Thank you.  And I also wanted to say that if anybody, everybody listening out there who doesn't have your two  CDs, you've got to go out and get them now.  Hey, this, I like this guy.  Unbelievable.  Oh, thank you, Mike.  And I just want to know if you were ever going to do that, you know, thinking about doing  stand-up again. 
[00:21:30]  Well, I'll tell you what, there might be a strike this summer.  The actors are going on strike, supposedly, I guess, in June.  Uh-oh.  And it looks like it's going to happen.  If that happens, I'm going to be off, so I might actually take the summer and go back  on tour.  Yeah, he does the comics come home every year in Boston.  Yeah, we do comics come home to benefit the Neely Foundation, which helps kids with cancer  every fall.  I believe this fall we will be back on Comedy Central, so.  Nice.  Oh, great.  But I might see you on tour this summer.  You never know.  Oh, great, great.  Thanks.  Take care, guys.  All right, man.  All right, man.  What kind of an effing curse is that?  The show just gets rolling and they're going to strike? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, please.  That's everybody, though.  It's the movies and everything, you know?  Scab.  Just scab it.  How long do you think the strike's going to be?  Cross the picket line.  I'll tell you who I blame.  Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks?  I don't know why.  I just do.  You've got to blame him.  I mean, I think he's a big shot.  He's got two Oscars.  He almost had a third one.  Why can't he go and fix it, you know?  Yeah.  What's the problem?  What are their problems now?  What's got to be addressed?  Well, I guess it's complicated.  It's the writers and the actors, but it comes down basically to the future.  It's like the baseball strike.  It's like the future in residuals and, you know, instead of free agency, it's dealing  with how much money you can chase. 
[00:22:30]  It doesn't have to do with you guys.  You don't know.  Hey, I want to keep working.  We worry about the show being a hit.  Right.  Please, I've been walking in a circle for a week, just pacing, smoking, cursing.  I don't know what the hell is that.  What's different than your normal life, really?  I blame A-Rod.  Adam before a gig.  Me too.  I blame A-Rod.  He started this whole thing.  Yeah, he did.  He did.  Now, last year at the Comics Come Home, that woman comic that came out with the goddamn  sandwich and wanted Cam to eat it, I'm sitting there horrified.  Cam did not want to do this.  No, I don't blame him. 
[00:23:00]  This big woman.  Big.  She said she would give like 20 bucks or 100 bucks to the charity.  Yeah.  It was a gag.  What she should have done is said, come on, Cam, eat the sandwich.  She got a big laugh when he first refused it.  And then, you know, if you're an experienced comic, you move on to your next bit.  You move on.  She kept pounding.  And finally, I had to come out and take a bite of my mouth.  Now, when you did that, I almost puked.  Yeah, but there was no way out.  She had that thing down her shirt.  I know.  There was no way out.  I had to do it.  And you know, that under boob area, there's no wash in that right there. 
[00:23:30]  I had to take one for the team.  You did.  I was standing backstage going, she's not going to stop.  I'm going to have to eat this goddamn sandwich.  My partner, Serpico, who produces the show, came up to me.  He goes, what are we going to do?  I said, I got to go out.  I got to eat the sandwich.  Eat the sandwich, right?  And he goes, yep.  I'll see you in about two minutes.  And I walked out and ate it.  Sometimes for comedy, it's like being at war.  It's like you got to dive on the ground.  Take one for the team, they call it.  Get in there, boss.  Nope.  No.  I ain't eating the musty bologna.  Yeah, everybody left the backstage area after about the first 30 seconds of her forcing  Cam to come down. 
[00:24:00]  Well, you put me up after, and I had to follow the sweaty sandwich bit.  Yeah, but you killed.  Yeah, but that's where you could kill.  Just the fact that you didn't weigh 4,000 pounds, maybe.  That was kind of nine more pleasant to the eye.  He can't hide food on that body.  Let's go.  Is he going to do a sandwich bit?  He's in the skinny prick up.  Yeah.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Listen, I caught Adam's show the other night at Rascals.  Yeah.  I wanted to ask him.  For a refund?  I'm sorry.  I got my phone beeping.  I want to ask him if he remembers the lady getting pissed off about him smoking. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Because my sister gave you the cigarette.  Oh, yeah.  And then that lady, did you see how pissed she was?  I know.  She wrote a note.  Oh, did she?  Yeah, she wrote a note to the back.  You know, you did a whole routine about quitting smoking.  Yeah.  Her face was so, like, she wanted to kill you, you know?  What is she doing in the club?  I know, really, right?  I don't know.  I was doing this thing on smoking, and I lit a cigarette, and, hey, hey, hey, and so I  put it out.  What?  From the back of the...  It was a non-smoking night.  What do you mean? 
[00:25:00]  It was a non-smoking night.  Yeah, non-smoking night?  Yeah, I didn't know that.  But you were doing a smoking...  Wait, wait, you were on stage smoking, and the lady got pissed?  I lit a cigarette on stage, and she got pissed.  You should have went into the urination pit.  Yeah.  Give it a golden shower.  Invite her to my next tour, by the way.  She's going to have a really good...  I like...  Because we all smoke on the set, and there was, like, a couple of prop ladies or something.  That's right, yeah.  And Dennis gave her a look that could, like, kill a plant.  No, but the best part was Lenny said to her, hey, sweetheart, you're out of a job if  you stop...  Don't stop complaining.  And she stopped complaining because she needed the job, but she would come in... 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, you got seven actors.  They all smoke.  Never mind the crew.  Well, we were smoking before you showed up.  We had scenes before you showed up, and she, like, coughed when I lit a cigarette, and  Lenny goes, all right, wait for Dennis to get here.  And then you showed up, and she...  I love this whole thing with people with the cab drivers and the people on planes and  everywhere.  I'm allergic to smoke.  Bullshit.  Okay?  I'm 44 years old, okay?  Nobody was allergic to smoking until about, what, eight years ago?  They started getting PC about it.  You can't be allergic to smoke. 
[00:26:00]  You can die from it, but you can't be allergic to it, okay?  It's two different things.  So just say that.  It's killing me.  Good.  It's killing me, too.  You know?  That's life.  Barbie.  Hey, Barbie.  Barbie.  Hey, Dennis.  Are you a dancer?  I'm a...  No.  You're really named Barbie?  Yes, I swear.  What's your full actual name?  Barbara.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay, Barbie.  But, Dennis, I'm a big fan of yours.  Two things.  I have every Christmas now tradition to watch The Rest, like 50 times.  Oh, good.  And I just wanted to ask you, is Hell Still Orange Plaid Bell-Bottoms and Shadow Dancing 
[00:26:30]  all day piped in?  Yeah, I'd say pretty much.  I think you could probably throw Ricky Martin into that mix.  And it's non-smoking.  Yeah, and it's probably non-smoking.  And it's non-smoking?  It's probably non-smoking.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  When are you going to do another HBO special?  I don't know.  I was just saying I might do it this summer.  If the actors are supposed to go on strike, I might go on tour if I have that down time.  Because I'm not considering that.  I'll go back to Denny's.  That is just your effing luck, Adam.  I know.  You realize him being on the show is why there's going to be a strike.  Thanks.  I don't understand it. 
[00:27:00]  No.  No.  It was going to happen anyways.  Like I said, Tom Hanks.  Wasn't a strike trying to happen with those lousy pilots you were making, Adam?  I think Tom Hanks wants a vacation.  That's what I think.  Oh, man.  Reggie.  Reggie, what's up?  Yeah.  Hi.  What's up, guys?  Hello, Dennis.  Yeah.  How are you, man?  I'm good, man.  I was able to catch your show last week for the first time with Elizabeth Hurley.  Yeah.  And I saw when your character went home, your wife was mad at you.  Yeah.  And then you went out and you went to a black chick's house. 
[00:27:30]  And was that your mistress?  That's my girlfriend.  Yeah.  Your girlfriend?  Yeah.  That's the girl from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  Karen Parsons.  Yeah.  She's hot, man.  She's a great actress.  Yeah.  That's what I want to ask.  You guys have a good day.  Okay.  All right.  That's all.  So, did you guys tell me we would clarify things on the show?  Yeah.  Clarification hotline.  Yeah.  I don't know what the hell that was.  Are you guys cops or something?  You guys are waving badges.  Are you cops?  You want to explain the job for the newbies?  I mean, it's a show I think you guys should check out, man. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, it's a sitcom only in the sense that it's 30 minutes long.  It's weird, though, because it has the feel like it should be an hour long.  Yeah, it does.  It has that feel.  Because it has that cop show feel to it.  Our goal is to make people laugh, and hopefully that's what they're doing every weekend, except  it's reality-based.  It's shot with one camera on location.  So, we've set out to make a show that would make us laugh that also didn't necessarily  look like something else on television.  I think we succeeded in that.  But I also think we lucked out.  I mean, the people in the cast, Adam, obviously, and Lenny, and Diane Farr, and John Ortiz, 
[00:28:30]  these guys are all hilarious.  And Keith David, you know, and one of the best writers in television, Peter Tolan, the guy  who did Larry Sanders.  So, look, I'm going to be honest with you, okay?  I can't swear, but I'm going to be honest with you.  I think it's the best show on television if you want to laugh.  You can say balls, right?  Oh, yeah.  You can laugh your balls off, okay?  And if you don't have balls, laugh your t***s off, okay?  Because that's what we set out to do every week.  And I don't know about you, but I used to sit at home and watch almost every other show  and go, this is not funny.  Even the shows I had friends on, I'm not laughing. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  So, I think...  I'm going out of my way to watch the show.  Yeah, hopefully you can sit and laugh.  You know, I can't do the sitcoms anymore.  I can't do the cop shows, but this show, I'm something about it.  Yeah, I mean, our goal is to make you laugh out loud.  And you're pushing the envelope, too.  I mean, everyone was talking about all the words you got on TV last week.  You got the T word for breasts on the air.  We can't say that on the radio anymore for some reason.  You can't say that?  We can say it on our show at 9.30.  Yeah, which is amazing.  And we say it a lot.  You got the T word on, you got balls.  Yeah, wait till you see what comes up in the next four weeks. 
[00:29:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Well, it's some stuff that...  Even I can't believe we get to do it, but...  The big C word.  The big C.  That's the goal.  Hey, weeps week.  Hey, we beat you to that.  Dennis, we beat you to that.  We got the C word on TV.  You got it in the newspaper, too.  Oh, yeah.  How'd you do that?  It became a huge story all over the country.  Some poor newswoman on Channel 4 was doing a live shot out in Times Square.  Oh, that's right.  I heard about this.  A listener.  We ambushed the reporters when they're on the street.  With a sign.  Dropped the A-bomb, held the sign, see you next Tuesday, right there. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  And she was just horrified.  And if that isn't bad enough, the next day it's in the newspaper, her picture.  Page three, post.  How'd they put it in the newspaper?  They took one letter out.  Yeah, they kind of pixelated it.  No, they had the C, and then everything else was, yeah, fuzzed out.  Yeah.  But you can figure it out.  Because that is the word, man.  And by the way, you know, I'm Irish.  Oh, really?  Yeah, my parents come from Ireland.  And that's, you know, over in Ireland and England, that word is used for everything.  In Australia.  An adverb.  It's a descriptive noun.  Yeah.  It's everything you could want it to be.  And everybody uses it. 
[00:30:30]  Mothers, fathers, kids, teachers.  Oh, here it's the showstopper in a fight.  Why is that?  It's the showstopper.  You know what, some little old Italian lady, I think, years ago, said, nobody's allowed  to say that word anymore.  And that was the beginning of the show.  And now we can't use it.  Because you're in an argument, no matter what level your argument's at, if you say, under  your breath, you F and C.  Right.  What?  But they can say anything to us.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing hurts us.  Them's the rules.  Yeah.  I want that word.  We've got to start a campaign.  That would bring it back.  Maybe we start another charitable foundation, okay? 
[00:31:00]  We start one, you know, for that word.  Save the sea.  Yeah, save the sea.  Save the sea.  Yeah.  I'm in.  Save the sea.  I think we can work with that.  Yeah.  One thing, because if you're losing the argument you're in.  Great t-shirts.  Great t-shirts.  You pull it out.  Right.  You're losing the argument you're in and you pull that out.  Right.  The argument you're in is forgotten about.  Oh, completely.  And it's replaced by this.  By that.  So sometimes it comes in.  How dare you use that word?  It comes in handy.  You have to get through the mushroom cloud and sift through the wreckage.  You know, after this show, I'm going to go get a save the sea shirt.  Yeah.  You have to now.  I remember being in Ireland one time with my cousin, Mahal, in a very crowded pub and 
[00:31:30]  there was an American girl in there.  Of course, everybody was saying that word in various, you know.  They just say it over there?  They just say it all the time.  But, you know, people describe my car, my, I can't say the word.  My blanket car broke down, you know.  So this American girl walks up and she goes, you know, excuse me, I'm here for three weeks  on vacation and I am really already tired of hearing that word.  And he said, too bad, you're going to be here for another three weeks.  Yeah.  And we're not putting the cigarettes out.  That's right.  In Ireland, everybody smokes.  Everyone wants to say hi to Dennis Leary. 
[00:32:00]  Stan, what's up?  Yeah, Dennis.  Stan.  Yeah.  Stan the man.  I read your article in GQ this month.  What?  I read your article in GQ this month.  Oh, yeah, the thing about the skating rink.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you get any of the top names like Mario Lemieux and them to come over and play with you?  Well, we were going to do that this year, but Mario went back to playing full time.  But I actually want to do a kind of a Field of Dreams thing with Gretzky and Bobby Orr  and hopefully Mario at some point coming out to my rink.  You got your own rink?  I have my own rink. 
[00:32:30]  It's not an indoor rink.  It's an outdoor rink I put up every winter.  Well, you could probably get the Islanders to show up at your house.  You get what, like Cam Neely and stuff?  Well, we played them.  We beat them.  Seven-nothing.  We only had four guys, too.  Don't mess with my Islanders, man.  It's been a tough few years.  And you know what?  The guy who can take the most blame is a former Bruin, Mike Mulberry.  Yes.  You know, it's just, they have done nothing for years.  They're trying.  And this is one of the top, at one time, top franchises in all the sports.  Right.  It's just...  You Ranger fans, shut up.  I'm Rangers.  Nothing's going on there either right now. 
[00:33:00]  Nothing's going on with the Bruins either.  There you have it.  Go P's!  Go P's, right.  And how's no my time?  Do we have you for a few more minutes?  What do you got to do?  Yeah, we got plenty of time.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let this show die then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  That's what I do now.  We're telling Dennis about... 
[00:33:30]  Medium well done.  About Dice.  Last time I saw Dice was in a studio parking lot.  I think it was at Warner Brothers.  And I was walking...  Were they throwing me out?  No, he was having a friendly meeting with Joel Silver who still likes Dice.  And Dice was walking out.  And he said...  I'll tell you this other story about Dice after that.  But he said...  I said, what are you doing?  What are you up to?  And he said, you know...  This is when he was going to do that sitcom.  Remember?  Which one?  The one where he changed his name?  Remember he changed his name? 
[00:34:00]  Was that it?  I'm Andrew Clay now.  No more Dice.  That's what he told me.  He goes, I'm changing my name.  I was like, to what?  And I thought he's met like something like a completely different name.  It was Andrew Clay.  And I was like, okay.  Good luck with that.  Run with it.  He said something to me one time when I first broke.  And I was going to my first photo shoot for No Cure for Cancer with the guys from the band and stuff.  But I had done a movie.  My first movie was in the can.  And I guess it had been in the press that I was signed up for another movie, which was The Ref. 
[00:34:30]  I'm walking in.  He's walking out.  And he goes, let me tell you something, kid.  That acting thing, it's a dead end.  And I was like, okay.  I'll talk to you later.  You know, now he's going to call.  Because he's got someone that listens to our show every day to make sure we talk nice.  Love so to Kenny.  Don't talk like that about the legend.  That'll happen.  What did him and Jay Moore get into a beef about?  Everything.  It makes no sense.  Like, Dice would call up and just say, Jay, what'd you say about me?  Right. 
[00:35:00]  And Jay's like, I didn't say anything.  Nah, nah, nah.  You said what to who about me?  And it goes like that.  Dice says he does the best for him.  We've gotten into arguments.  Dice versus Dice.  You sound more like Dice.  Who's the other guy that used to do Dice?  It was not very good.  Gilbert.  Gilbert.  Oh, Gilbert does Gilbert Dice Clay.  Yeah.  He does Gilbert Dice Clay, which is fine.  But you sound just like him.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'll throw you one.  Okay?  You should get you to be Dice Clay and get Jay to be Christopher Walken.  Chris Walken.  We've done that a little bit. 
[00:35:30]  It's a lot of fun.  Have you seen that Chris Walken video for Fat Boy Slim?  Yes, for Fat Boy Slim.  It rocks.  It's hilarious.  He dives over the balcony.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Not bad.  We're in the middle of commercials.  It doesn't matter.  But Woodbridge Power Sports.  It's funny.  Dennis, we turn off the mics.  Dennis goes, this is what you guys do.  Oh, my goodness.  This is it.  This is it.  It's no real form.  Hang out.  Hang out.  BS and read commercials.  Kind of the same thing you would do in a bar with your friends.  Yeah, for four hours a day.  That's right on the commercial.  The show started today because a girl in that window over there was taking a shower.  So for 20 minutes, our show was just us describing what she was doing. 
[00:36:00]  That's what we do.  Gawking.  We had to get a couple of mics hooked up.  We're hanging out the window.  How long have you guys been here?  Almost three years.  And is it the first time you've seen a girl taking a shower over there?  A couple of times.  The show's been too busy, so we can't really take a look.  Is she new?  We've never seen this girl.  Very attractive.  An eight or a nine.  No joking.  Really?  Solid.  All the way through.  Soaping up.  So we're just describing.  Now she's shaving this.  Now she's cleaning that.  It was hilarious.  For 20 minutes.  That's how the show starts at.  What time was that?  Right at three.  Yeah, three o'clock she's taking a shower.  So was she going to work or just getting up? 
[00:36:30]  I don't know.  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Her schedule.  We're thinking she was getting ready for happy hour.  You guys got to get one of those telescopes.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  With the camera, everything.  It's right there, though.  Yeah, I know.  It's 40, 50 feet.  I'd have binoculars.  I'd get the eye surgery.  You guys got to keep us up to date on this, whether or not it happens again and again.  Deal.  Oh, yeah.  You better come back.  I'd come back for that.  Most people say, yeah, we'll be back, and then they never show up again.  I used to live on the 28th or the 32nd floor of a high-rise over on the west side, and I  had a view of about six different buildings, and just my luck. 
[00:37:00]  And I'm telling you, when I say I put time in, almost every night I was home, I checked  out for a year.  Nothing ever happened except once a fat guy came home and started to and stopped and fell asleep.  Damn, I put my time in, at least finished the job.  They probably dumped out.  Fat guy, naked, pleasuring himself, didn't complete the job, and fell asleep.  Anthony, Woodbridge Power Sports.  I'm sure they're happy about following that little story.  They don't care.  That's why they advertise with us. 
[00:37:30]  Go to Woodbridge Power Sports and J.O. right in their showroom.  They won't care.  It's large enough.  Is J.O. the radio word for what I said?  You could say jacket.  Oh, jacket.  I don't know.  Something about the...  Even jack off.  Right.  Like the jerk word.  It makes no sense.  And all the rules go out the window.  Well, we just...  I had to dump out of it.  You should see when we drop the C word.  Yeah.  Oh, it stops people on the track. 
[00:38:00]  I usually do it when we have guests in here that have no clue how the delay works and we  can dump out of words when we say them.  And we're just sitting there and they go, ooh, can I say ass?  And they go, we don't give an F, you know, and say the word.  Yeah, go ahead, you see.  See, we're sitting...  They shock.  Their jaw hits the ground.  And we're sitting here thinking our radio show's pretty cool, but Dennis gets the T word  on TV.  I know.  And his balls is on TV now.  That's right.  I think TV's getting a lot more of the racy than radio.  We can't even say the J.O. word.  I know there's a lot of people out there watching TV and just thinking to themselves, I wish  somebody would say the word balls. 
[00:38:30]  Well, guess what?  Wednesdays at 9.30.  We got your balls.  We're your show.  The job.  Where do I go for balls?  I go for balls right here.  That's right.  Honey, I've had enough musical theater and enough great acting.  Where can I hear the word balls repeated endlessly?  What's the brother got to do get some balls up in this mug?  Hey, this is Adam Ferrari.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  It's absolutely awful.  Enjoy it. 
[00:39:00]  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  That's cool.  Dennis Leary in the studio with Adam Ferrari.  They're on that show, The Job, that we're really digging on ABC.  It's on Wednesday nights at 9.30 after Drew Carey.  Very, very funny show.  And someone just turned us on to the Randy Johnson video, taking out that bird.  Wow.  What website is that on?  ESPN.  ESPN.com?  Yeah.  I'll put it on.  It's on a loop, right?  It's looped, and this bird just explodes.  If you haven't heard the story, Randy Johnson pitching, minor league game,  and the bird was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
[00:39:30]  He flies down in front of the batter.  He gets hit by a Randy Johnson fastball.  What's that, a buck ten?  Easily.  Wow.  That's nasty.  They sent in a pinch bird to run through.  That bird ain't going anywhere.  He's an expert.  Yeah, it's guts and blood and feathers everywhere.  You can tell the internet's been around for a while when you look at anything else other  than porn.  Yeah.  It used to just be like 24 hours a day.  I remember when my brother first got hooked up.  He had this Mac. 
[00:40:00]  A real slow internet connection.  You'd wait for ten minutes for a picture to scroll and download.  And you would just sit there all night.  It's like, oh, it's six in the morning.  Jesus Christ, I've got to go to work.  One more picture.  One more.  It was a brand new medium, you know?  Yeah.  Anything you wanted was there.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Now it's age old.  Do you surf the net?  I don't, you know, I'm computer.  You don't look like a surfing guy.  I don't get out.  I use it as a glorified typewriter.  And if it's something like that, like a bird getting hit by Randy Johnson or, you know.  You'd want to check it out, right? 
[00:40:30]  Some naked famous chick.  I'll go check it out.  Yeah.  Even if they just pasted somebody's head onto a fake body.  Yeah.  I'm not immune to that.  You know what I mean?  They're getting good at that, though.  Yeah.  Let's get to the point where you can't really tell.  I mean, the Britney Spears one that's out there, her against the mirror?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's fake.  It's Photoshopped.  It's good enough for me.  Looks like her.  They did a good job.  I hope they have that in high schools now, Photoshop.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of Woodshop.  They just edit pictures.  Yeah.  They got it everywhere.  I got to get going soon, guys.  I just realized I'm hockey.  Now, you're playing hockey.  Yeah, I'm playing hockey in about 45 minutes. 
[00:41:00]  How often do you play?  I skate three or four times a week.  Really?  If I'm home in New York, if I'm in L.A.  Now, this is real hockey where people are hitting each other.  Yeah.  Good old-fashioned, old-school hockey.  What's the worst injury you've had from them?  Last year, I broke my shoulder right before I started a movie, which was bad.  Sorry.  Nice.  Yeah, I mean, it's just one of those things.  Who do you play with?  I play with various guys.  Tim Robbins plays.  He's good.  There's a lot of actors who play and a lot of ex-hockey players.  Cam Neely.  They treat you good, or is it like... 
[00:41:30]  Hey, I'm going to slam tennis into the wall.  You know how it is.  It's guys.  You start out like...  I have a rink at my house I put up every winter, an outdoor rink.  And you start out every morning the same way on Saturday morning.  You know, 12 guys show up and some kids.  And it starts out, okay, here's the rules and this friendly game.  And within an hour, people are breaking up fights and hitting each other with sticks.  Who's McSorley?  Get the bird!  Get the bird!  Yeah.  Hit the bird!  I might be McSorley.  You never know.  Yeah.  You never know.  He has his own Zamboni, Anthony.  Yeah, well...  I mean, I'll brag for you. 
[00:42:00]  Who has a Zamboni in their backyard?  Dennis Leary.  Look, hockey's about several things.  And two of those things are beer and Zambonis.  Okay?  So, that's the way it goes.  Drink them while you play?  Zamboni.  We don't drink well if that's not allowed.  No.  Because the guys I play with are just...  If they had booze in them, forget.  You can drink...  The rule is you can drink as soon as we're done playing.  But, you know, whenever there's a new guy, he always comes down with a cooler full of beer.  And we go, yeah, after the game.  Right.  Not now.  Right.  Because we don't wear helmets or anything, you know?  Yeah.  It's really old school.  I was going to say old school. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Nobody wears helmets.  Has Adam played on?  I ain't playing.  What are you crying?  I'll drive to Zamboni.  You see the way he walks?  You're going to make him skate?  You've got to be kidding me.  What's wrong with his walking, Anthony?  He's got that go funny walk from his growth plate.  You know, that's a result of a major injury he had when he was a kid.  His father had him with a sledgehammer.  Dented part of his brain.  And he had it coming.  And for that day, the garbage never was not taken out after that.  That's right.  It was a ball peen hammer, I think.  That's funny.  Poor guy. 
[00:43:00]  I think we have to get Dennis out of here.  Hey, so I want to say two things.  The job Wednesdays at 9.30.  You guys are already pushing that.  But there's a movie called Blow, which I produced, which stars Johnny Depp,  which is based on a true story about a friend of mine.  And it's directed by Ted Demme, another good friend of mine.  And I've got to tell you, I'm being honest here, because I don't usually brag about myself.  This movie is a great movie.  And somebody in your crew saw it, right?  You saw it.  Yeah, Big Kev saw it.  And you liked it, right?  Yeah, I thought it was fantastic.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  It's really the best thing Johnny Depp's done.  I've seen the trailers.  And when you watch the trailer, it's one of those movies that, when it gets done, 
[00:43:30]  you're just like, oh, goddamn, I've got to see that.  It looks great.  It looks slick.  Penelope Cruz is so hot in this movie.  I watched the previews.  I'm trying to pick out her flaw.  She doesn't have a flaw.  Wait till you see it.  She doesn't have one.  There's a couple scenes in this movie.  She can't hit a curveball.  There's the flaw.  I'll tell you what.  She can't hit a bird from 60 feet.  She walks funny.  She doesn't need to.  Well, yeah.  But, okay, cool.  Blow.  And you're not in it at all?  No, I just produced it.  Hey, man, this has been a treat, because we really are big fans of yours. 
[00:44:00]  Well, I'll come back.  Now, you guys are like four blocks from my office.  We want to be like in the job, even in a cell or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, right.  Like he hasn't heard that a thousand times.  I know.  But it's worth a shot.  I'll tell you what.  If you can get me back here.  You can run us over by a car or something.  When you get me back here when the girl's taking a shower.  Deal.  Then I'll get you on the show.  Deal.  All right?  That's the deal.  Is video good enough?  Video would be all right, but I'd like to witness it live.  All right.  And then take the video home.  Right on.  For further research.  His office is four blocks away.  If I just go there to say hi one day, I bet now I could just say hi. 
[00:44:30]  Dennis, is there some guy here from a radio show?  Okay, get him out.  I'll be the guy in the background at the police station.  I'm just not a typewriter.  I don't care.  Yeah, there you go.  Anything.  Oh, we got to get him out of here.  Yeah, I got to go.  We were going to tell you about a video we have that all our guests have to watch before  they leave called Century Sex.  Can I see it the next time I come?  Yeah, a hundred-year-old lady getting banged.  It's pretty funny.  It's so sexy.  It looks like E.T.  Look at the look.  Oh, my God.  Look at the look.  You scared me there for a second. 
[00:45:00]  If she stops having sex, she'll die.  Dennis, you'll know why we play that?  So the guests never forget us.  That's right.  Because how are you going to forget us after we show you something like that?  That's an image that's just stuck in your brain.  But all you see is someone getting, like, you know, railed, and then they slowly  pan up, and you see it's like a naked E.T.  If they didn't run out of tape, it would have been a snuff film.  It looks right at the money shot.  It just looks like she's going to die.  It's orrid.  Orrid.  Well, with that, we'll let Dennis Leary go.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, my favorite radio show on XM. 
[00:45:30]  Should we talk about the cruise now or what?  Oh, I can't wait.  Here we go.  That's what I need.  To take off the sting of my stunning defeat, I need to go for a ride on the River Rose.  The River Rose.  That's where you do some spinning, but it's with a mule between your ass cheeks.  What the hell is the River Rose?  I don't know.  This is one of our buddy's boats.  Now, I went out on this boat for 4th of July.  You've been on the River Rose?  You've been on the River Rose?  They have specialty cruises that I have no clue what they are, and he hadn't started doing 
[00:46:00]  this yet.  Did you go on the Periwinkle cruise?  No, I wasn't on the Periwinkle cruise.  I went on the 4th of July, about four years ago, I guess, and we went up the East River  right by the United Nations, right where the fireworks just set off, and it was really great.  Did some drinking on there, watching the fireworks.  It was a really good time.  We should get a booze cruise together for this show.  Yeah.  Thinking about the Bill O'Reilly disaster. 
[00:46:30]  How about the cruise right here?  The River Rose?  The one they're talking about.  They have to change it to the River Tulips on your organs.  Well, apparently, one 4th of July cruise a year isn't enough to keep the boat going,  so he has opened up the boat to various specialty cruises, and I guess one that he's advertising  is The River Rose is available for alternative lifestyle weddings, engagements, birthdays,  or any occasion.  Any occasion.  Basically, no matter where you stick your dick, you can do it on this boat. 
[00:47:00]  Midnight cruises, sunset cruises, Sunday tea dances.  Oh, Sunday tea dances.  No, no, and it's spelled T-E-A, but I think it's supposed to be just the letter T.  T.  Everybody does those dances.  He says, we're leaving quickly, leaving quickly.  Tea dances.  The Gay Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise.  Basically, you know, you can watch the sun go down, elbow to the ribs. 
[00:47:30]  Sunset.  Hey, set your sun on this car.  Well, that's right.  And then he can set his eyes on his friends' families who appear normal, while yours doesn't.  How come there's a mom and dad in that home, and I just have two fellas with bathrobes  who cough a lot?  He was so excited about his joke.  I know.  That's right.  It was a Japanese fact.  That was more just excitement coming out.  He knew he had a good one. 
[00:48:00]  Bathrobes.  Oh, my breathrobes.  Yeah, me cough.  Gay Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise, Friday, June 24th, boarding at 6.45 p.m., returns at  11 o'clock p.m.  And God knows what's going to happen during that cruise.  That's right.  It's going to be sassy.  Going to have to squeegee the deck off when he gets back.  Cruise the sky.  Oh, this is around here.  I thought this was in Florida.  Cruise the skyline of Manhattan's Statue of Liberty.  That's right.  Just see a...  Which is actually a tranny, the Statue of Liberty. 
[00:48:30]  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Big Dick Daddy.  Wave a big thing in the air aboard the River Rose, sailing from the World's Fair Marina  in Queens.  There's free parking there.  Our Sunset Cruise features guest DJs to the sounds of 70s, 80s, 90s disco classics.  Yeah.  House music, salsa merengue, cash bar with bar, specials, beer, wine, mixed drinks.  Ron B. as Tina Turner.  Oh, no.  That's right. 
[00:49:00]  What a shock.  Oh, brother.  The female impersonator will host a show featuring Miss Mess performing a salute to disco.  Be sure to get your tics early at the free exclamation point.  Of course.  Which means they're going fast.  $35.  Pics of an aerial disease in the Navy.  Drops down to your knees.  Yeah.  $35 in advance on our site. 
[00:49:30]  Put your dick in another man.  Stick it in his can.  In the Navy.  In the Navy.  In the Navy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a ball bag on ass seats.  And my ass, it's black and blue.  They want you.  I'll suck off a Puerto Rican or a Jew.  All right.  So, be sure to hop on the hip proof. 
[00:50:00]  $35 in advance or $40 at Dockside.  Oh.  Oh, Dockside.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I heard that wrong.  I love the website.  www.divasgamesanddykes.com  You know what you're getting when you go there.  Divasgamesanddykes.com  Yes.  Woo!  In the Navy.  Catch the HIV.  In the Navy.  So, he's doing gay cruises, obviously. 
[00:50:30]  Yes.  Our friend, who ironically has a gay porno mustache.  Yes, he does.  They're going to say, everyone that gets on the boat with Billy is going to say,  Did I see you in 1978 in a film?  Ah, no.  Somebody else.  I just can't picture him on this cruise.  I neither can.  Does he go, or does he just send the boat out by itself, leave it to his own devices? 
[00:51:00]  I bet he goes.  He probably ties his shirt and a little fucking bow in the front and wears Speedos and a pair  of sneakers with no socks.  Oh, he's a queen.  All right.  Divasdamesanddykes.com  Or you can email divasdamesdykes at AOL.com  And it's June 24th of Friday night, and it should be a nice cruise.  I've actually cruised around in the boats, not this particular one.  No?  But, yeah, it's actually cool.  You went on a gay cruise?  I certainly didn't. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, okay.  It was the comedy cellar cruise.  We should get a booze cruise together, though.  Squeegee the deck.  It looks like a bunch of white jellyfish behind the boat.  Jesus.  Just chasing it.  Hey, somebody spilled silicone implants all over the place.  No, no, no.  Hey, everyone wants to talk about gravity.  We're done with the gravity.  And, by the way, you don't have to squeegee the deck.  Just ask the guests to lick the floor before they go off the boat.  Hey, this is Paul Heyman, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:52:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  So, I got a letter from one of our listeners in the Massachusetts area, Anthony.  Yes.  And I felt pretty special because she's completely out of her effing mind.  Uh-huh.  But just when you were feeling special, I guess.  I know.  I was bragging about the letter, and I was showing you today, and you got one today from the same lady.  I certainly did.  She writes us separately. 
[00:52:30]  And I feel extra, extra special, Opie, because look what I got with mine.  You got a picture.  I got a photo.  This shit.  Tommy, you want to take a look?  Oh, wow.  Is that before or after she kidnapped James Collins?  Exactly.  That's what we were thinking.  She's a middle-aged woman that looks a lot like, what's her name there?  Just read the letter, Mr. Man.  There's a railroad tie and some sledgehammers in her future.  What date is your letter?  Mine is dated 5-6-0-2.  And you're just getting yours. 
[00:53:00]  Mine was 5-6-0-2 as well.  When did you get yours?  Last week.  Last week?  Well, that's the fine mail delivery system we have here.  Thank God the security's in place where they check all the letters that come in.  They rip them open, then they put a seal on it that says it's been checked.  It actually goes to a different location now.  Does it?  Our mail goes all over the place.  I'm getting stuff that was sent to me three and a half weeks ago now.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  All right.  Security.  For our safety, though.  To backtrack, Brian, I waited longer for O&A's next CD than I do... 
[00:53:30]  Wait, I'm waiting longer for O&A's next CD than I am for a new Voss joke.  Oh.  God.  Nice.  Which is true.  Okay, here it is.  I stink.  Here it is, Anthony.  Yes.  Dated 5-6-0-2.  From the lovely Lynn from Massachusetts, okay?  Lynn from Mass.  Well, the letter starts off, hi, Daddy.  Cool.  Now, that might, in some cases, be kind of cool.  If the girl is maybe a fan, maybe she's got a little something for you. 
[00:54:00]  She's going, oh, hi, Daddy.  You know.  Hi, Daddy.  A little sick, but could be taken in that context.  Forgive me, please, for not writing for many months.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  Not my son, Joey.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  I'm assuming, yes, it is your son, Joey.  Is that who she's talking about?  Yes.  I've never met my son, Joey. 
[00:54:30]  Dad, I love Anthony's son, Joey, so much.  Mom mailed me $178 for doing good work at her house.  Dad, I am having my dog, Rock, move in with me.  You have no say in it, Daddy.  Mom told me you wanted my phone number.  I don't know if I want you to have my phone number, period.  Daddy, I have something to say.  Here goes.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  What?  Let me read that again because that's exactly what she meant. 
[00:55:00]  Here goes.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Now, did my son, Joey, get her pregnant or is she pregnant holding my son, Joey?  The Joey that she talks about that's already living is the same Joey that she's saying she  might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Get it?  Has she been having sex with my son, Joey, or is she pregnant with my son, Joey?  Joey's alive already.  Okay.  But now she's talking like Joey's not alive yet. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Okay.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant.  Oh, maybe.  With Anthony's son, Joey.  And I don't think so.  But don't tell Grammy White, okay?  Daddy, tell Mom to get out of my apartment.  I'm not in bed with Anthony's son, Joey.  Oh, see?  Maybe she's having sex with Joey.  Ma is a liar.  I have to stop now.  Love, Lynn.  So I was bragging, like, look at what I got today.  And Anthony got a letter from the same lady today. 
[00:56:00]  Bad mail from some flounder.  Yeah, I got the same one.  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow  his top.  Now, I don't have any daughters.  Wait, wait.  If she's calling you daddy, apparently she believes she's your daughter and she's pregnant  with Joey.  So, wait, she's my daughter, so I'm daddy?  Yeah.  But then who are you? 
[00:56:30]  I'm.  Wait, does she start your letter off?  Hi, daddy.  You're my father-in-law.  How does your letter start?  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is your daughter.  If your daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  She's your daughter.  I'm daddy.  She's my daughter.  And you're dodging her.  Wait, all right.  So, wait.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me.  So, how are you related to this?  This is like a goddamn David Lynch movie. 
[00:57:00]  It makes no sense.  I think she's married to you, Anthony.  She's married to me?  She's married to you.  You had the son, Joey, that she wants to, I don't know.  Well, let me finish mine, and perhaps it'll open up a whole world of enlightenment.  Maybe the listeners can help us.  All right, start over.  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  I'm going for an upper GI Thursday.  Anthony, I love your son, Joey, so much. 
[00:57:30]  He is my angel.  Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey, the special love he wants.  Anthony, I might be having my Dalmatian Rocky move in with me.  Anthony, I am very lonesome with my dog.  I want to ask my daddy if he could lend me 15 bucks.  Is Opie your daddy?  Is that what she says?  She wants 15 bucks from you, Opie?  I used the $175 you gave me, Anthony. 
[00:58:00]  I'm afraid of my daddy.  Can you write to me?  I am very, very sorry for not writing to you and my daddy.  I feel bad.  I will write to you and dad often as possible.  Take care.  Love, Lynn.  And according to the photo, how old would you make her?  At least 50.  She looks like she's...  52.  Is that what you're guessing?  I'll go 52.  52.  I'm thinking because of her appearance, she might be younger than she looks, but it's no younger than very late 40s. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  But, okay, I'll go with the late 40s, early 50s.  She is overweight.  She is old and matronly looking.  And she's wearing a house dress standing in front of a wall.  Big ass house dresses.  And she does.  Looks like...  What's her face?  She's there from the Stephen King movie.  Wonderful.  She just looks... 
[00:59:00]  I hate crazy people.  And why are you working with us?  I love them, yeah, right?  You don't understand.  I have no tolerance for the mentally challenged.  I just...  They really annoy me.  Well, this woman is totally...  She's a nut.  ...out of her bird.  And lo and behold, we have her on the phone.  Yes, we do.  Maybe now, Opie, we can get an answer.  Who's daddy?  Where is my son, Joey?  And is he alive?  Is he pregnant?  Who's her father? 
[00:59:30]  Is it you?  Well, Jim has figured out the relationship.  Oh, thank God.  Jim.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Help us out here.  Opie, you're her daddy, right?  All right.  I think we got that.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is Joey's daddy, and she's banging him.  You're banging...  She's banging Joey?  She's banging your son, Joey.  Hmm.  I...  So, Mike is saying on line one, Ant is his own grandfather.  Well, I got...  I missed the middle of the reading from the delay, but I'm pretty sure that's what I got.  Okay. 
[01:00:00]  Anthony, I love your son, Joey, so much.  He is my angel.  It sounds more motherly than...  Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey, the special love he wants.  He is your son.  Oh, so she...  I think Lynn has been cheating on me with Anthony.  No, no, no.  I mean, you're our father.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, wait a minute.  So, my son, Joey...  Exactly.  Is like...  Is banging Lynn.  Opie's...  Could be Opie's son-in-law at some point, if they hook up.  There you go.  So, what does that make you two to each other? 
[01:00:30]  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Well...  I don't know.  Would you...  Well, you're both fathers, but you're...  All right.  Well, she's on the line.  Let's talk to her.  Oh, let's.  Thank you, Jim.  I can't wait.  Bye, guys.  All right.  So, here's Lynn.  If they...  Oh, my God.  It takes forever to put him on hold.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Here we go.  Hey, Lynn.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Great.  You know, we got your letters.  Mm-hmm.  And we've been reading them, Lynn.  Mm-hmm.  And they're good letters.  Very good letters.  Good, good, good letters. 
[01:01:00]  You did good writing them, Lynn.  Mm-hmm.  Good letter writing.  Good letter writing.  Now, we just want to know a couple of things, Lynn.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Who is your daddy?  Anthony.  But...  But...  See, Lynn...  Uh-huh.  Opie got the letter that said...  Uh-huh.  That was addressed to daddy.  Mm-hmm.  So, I thought...  I made a mistake.  I meant to put to Anthony, you know.  Okay.  So, I... 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, that was my mistake.  I had just woken up when I woke up there.  Oh, okay.  That's okay, Lynn.  Yeah.  Everything's good.  Mm-hmm.  Now, I'm your father?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  All right.  How old of a girl are you, Lynn?  How old are you, Lynn?  I'm 41.  You're 41?  Mm-hmm.  And that's your father?  That's good.  I'm her daddy.  You're 60?  I have no idea.  Now, Lynn, who is Opie to you?  He is my boyfriend's dad.  Your boyfriend's dad.  And your boyfriend is... 
[01:02:00]  His name is Joey.  His name is George Glass.  Wait.  His name is Joey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anthony is...  Yeah.  You're...  I'm Lynn's father, Opie.  Father.  So, you're 60.  I'm Joey's father?  Yes.  Which means you're going out with a kid that's got to be...  How old is...  I...  How old is...  Joey is 37.  Joey's 37.  Yeah.  Opie, you're about 57 years old.  I'm probably going to be 42 years old next month.  Oh, you are. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  So, I'm about 57 and it's about 60.  Uh-huh.  When did you sleep with a rhinoceros, Anthony?  You got it.  I don't remember that.  Now, Lynn...  Uh-huh?  If...  If I'm your father...  Uh-huh.  Who's your mommy?  My mother's first name is Nancy.  Nancy and I apparently had a relationship with Nancy.  Yes.  And we had sex.  I guess.  And you were born.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I don't know. 
[01:03:00]  I'm also hearing, Lynn, that you have a baby due in August?  Yes.  And Anthony is not too happy about it.  You know, and...  Why am I not happy?  I'm ecstatic, Lynn.  Dad, number one.  First of all, I love Joey like he was my own.  Dad.  And you know something?  That you're having Joey's baby is a very good thing.  Be quiet.  She wants to talk to her daddy.  Okay.  Talk to daddy, Lynn.  Okay, thanks.  Go ahead, Lynn. 
[01:03:30]  Hi, Dad.  Hi, Lynn.  How have you been?  I miss you.  I know.  I miss you too, Dad.  But, um...  You know what?  I'm going to leave your apartment.  I can't live here with you anymore.  I'm just going to take my dog and Joey.  I'm just going to leave.  No.  Oh, please don't go, Lynn.  I need you around.  Dad.  You're my daughter.  Dad.  Yes.  Number one.  Yes.  I'm 41 years old.  Okay?  Let me...  You're still my little girl, Lynn.  You're still my little girl. 
[01:04:00]  Dad.  I understand that.  You're daddy's little girl, Lynn.  Why do you upset me like this?  Why?  I'm sorry.  Why do you upset me?  Dad, number one.  Oh, my God.  You're my little girl.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I'm sorry.  Does the dog talk to you, Lynn?  No, Dad.  No.  Daddy wants to see you naked.  No, Dad.  I don't think so.  I don't think so, Dad. 
[01:04:30]  Daddy's home.  Daddy, please.  Your daddy's home.  Daddy.  Dad, listen to me, okay?  Okay, Lynn.  For an example, when we were at Aunt Mary's yesterday...  I remember.  Yes.  It was yesterday.  Oh, yesterday, yes.  I told Rick this.  Rick is bullshit.  He's really upset, okay?  Yes, what happened?  Number one, when I got into your car yesterday...  Yeah.  ...and I had my hair...  My hair is long and curly.  You know that.  It's so cute.  Listen, Daddy, okay?  Yes, okay, daughter.  Number one, Daddy, you turn around and you told me that I look like a witch because I had 
[01:05:00]  my hair long and I didn't put it up.  No, a good witch.  I meant...  Daddy?  Lynn, damn you.  I meant like Sabrina the teenage witch.  Daddy?  She's cute.  Daddy?  I'm sorry, Lynn.  I was drinking.  You embarrassed me yesterday, Daddy.  I was drinking, Lynn.  Like when I had sex with Nancy and had you.  Daddy, I...  Dad, I just can't live here with you anymore.  Please stay, Lynn.  Daddy never wanted you, Lynn.  Yeah.  You shut up.  I realize that. 
[01:05:30]  Your son Joey is corrupting Lynn.  I realize that.  Is Joey treating you nice, Lynn?  Yes, Daddy.  Number one, we had gone out Saturday.  He took me out to the outback and we had such a good time.  Hey, Lynn, but the baby you're carrying is not Joey's, is it?  Yes, it is, Dad.  No, this is your father.  Yeah, it was...  It is not...  It is not...  It is not...  It is not Joey's.  The baby you're carrying is Satan's. 
[01:06:00]  Daddy, no.  It's Satan's child.  It's the devil's child, Lynn.  Rick was right.  Rick was right, Daddy.  Rick was right.  What?  What did Rick say?  Rick had told me that, you know, that I could have the baby, you know.  Rick is wrong.  And now Rick must die.  I just shot Rick.  I just shot Rick.  Dad, Rick told me that since I'm 41 years old, I have my life.  I can do what I want, okay?  I'm not your little girl anymore, Daddy. 
[01:06:30]  I'm 41 years old.  I want you to have an abortion.  Okay?  I want you to have an abortion and get rid of Joe's baby.  No, Daddy.  I'm not giving up Opie's baby.  Suck it out with a Hoover vacuum if you have to.  Wait, hold on.  Opie's baby?  Is it Opie's baby?  It's Opie's son's baby.  Opie's son's baby.  Well, my son cannot...  Dad!  Number one.  My son cannot get out with you anymore.  What, Lynn?  There's no way in hell I'm giving this baby up.  Dad, you had no say in this matter, okay?  I'm going to call the government and they're going to take the baby away. 
[01:07:00]  Daddy, I can't.  The government is going to take it away unless you put tinfoil on your head and keep the  signals from reaching your brain, Lynn.  Put the tinfoil on your head, Lynn.  Quickly.  The government will find you.  Lynn, Lynn, quickly put tinfoil on your head.  Do you have tinfoil there?  No.  Yeah, it's covered.  Lynn, quickly get tinfoil, please.  Can you do this for me?  No.  Lynn, please, my little girl.  Get tinfoil and put it on your head.  What?  To keep the government's signals from reaching your brain.  Dad, come on.  Why?  Do I sound crazy?  Dad, you were drinking again, weren't you? 
[01:07:30]  Yes, I'm drinking.  That's right, Bill.  That's like I was when I touched you, Lynn, when you were child.  Do you remember when I touched you?  I'm so sorry.  Right, Dad.  Right.  Another thing, too, Dad.  Okay?  Oh, another thing, okay.  Yeah, listen to this, okay?  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm going to tell Oprah this, and I'm going to make sure he tells you.  All right.  Number one, Daddy, I had $175, okay, for my payroll check.  Hey, you turned around, and you took $60 off me.  I needed it.  Oh, my God, Daddy.  I needed it.  Oh, my Daddy.  I needed it for gas. 
[01:08:00]  Can you say three rights, make a left, by the way?  What?  Yeah, you got two jobs.  Yeah, you got two jobs.  Okay, number one.  Number two, you have two good paychecks, okay, and you took $60 out of my wallet that  day.  Dad, and that's all I had to listen to until this week, okay?  You know, Tuttle from New York checked in and said, Opie's son, Joey, his father makes  $130 million, and he only takes you to the Outback.  He is a cheap bastard.  Dad, we had such a good time, okay? 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  Didn't we have fun, my daughter?  Dad.  Yeah.  Daddy, please.  Okay, you don't understand what my point is.  What do you want from me?  What I want is I want you to write me a letter, okay, saying that I want you to write the  people downstairs in the office room upstairs from where you live, explaining to them that  I want my dog to move in with me and you.  I want a letter written.  No pets allowed.  Huh?  Dad.  The dog is evil.  Daddy, no, you don't understand, okay? 
[01:09:00]  The dog is evil.  Dad.  We are bringing the dog to the pound.  No.  The dog is going to the pound.  Dad, I want my dog to move in with us, okay?  The dog's going to the dog pound.  I'm coming and picking him up and taking him down to the dog pound where he'll be gassed.  Daddy.  Daddy, please.  I want...  Shut up and listen to your father.  Please, Daddy.  Can you walk in with us?  No.  No.  He can't.  No.  No.  Lynn, know why he can't?  Why?  The dog is dead.  Daddy.  You know, just because you're... 
[01:09:30]  Just because you have a hero question, but...  Listen to your father.  Don't blame it on me, okay?  Dad, please.  I want Rocky to move in with me, okay?  What?  You want to go to the moon?  What?  I said I want Rocky to move in here.  Hey, what kind of medication do you want?  I want to have my dog in your apartment.  Hey, Lynn.  What?  What kind of medication do you want?  I'm rolling your breath in for my asthma.  What?  I'm...  I have asthma, okay?  Yeah.  And I want breath in for my asthma.  Nothing for the wacky thoughts in your head? 
[01:10:00]  I don't have wacky thoughts.  Knock on wood.  Hey, Lynn.  We can go down to the free clinic and get one of those abortions.  Dad, please.  Okay, no.  And you're not giving me...  I'm not giving me...  I'm not giving me...  I'm not giving me...  I'm not giving me...  Joey's baby.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  Dad, I don't believe...  The power of Christ compels you.  Dad, I don't believe that.  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  Dad, I don't believe in that stuff.  You know, I really don't.  Hey.  Dad. 
[01:10:30]  What?  The only thing I'm asking you to do very nicely is...  No!  If you can write the Burlington Housing Authority a letter...  Nope.  ...thing that you have...  That you gave your daughter permission to have my daughter moving on me.  The dog is dead.  Dad.  No.  The dog is dead.  No.  Daddy, Grammy is a beautiful dog.  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  And I can't believe for that.  You'll get nothing like it.  You want me to smack you again?  No.  I'll smack you.  No.  Okay.  I'll smack that smile off your face.  That retarded grin. 
[01:11:00]  Fine, Dad.  I got your picture right here.  This is your brother, Jim.  This is your brother, Jim.  Would you please give the dog a Hummer and then put a pistol in your fat mouth?  Daddy, please.  Can we have Rocky moving in with us?  Did you kill two Colombians any time?  All right.  Just checking.  No.  We will let Rocky move in with you as long as you let Daddy come into your room again  tonight.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No way.  You look awful sexy in this dress. 
[01:11:30]  I'm looking at the picture.  I'll lift that up and put my head under there like a 17th century photographer.  Daddy, Daddy, I'm only asking this one favor.  No.  No, daughter.  And I'm going to keep asking you.  I want Rocky in here.  No.  Well, then can we get a small dog?  No.  We'll talk about it tonight when I slip into your bed.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  You'll feel my beard and my whiskey breath against the back of your tender neck.  Right, Dad.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  And one other thing, too.  I'm going to come by tomorrow and punch you in the stomach to get rid of that baby. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, one other thing, too.  Okay.  What?  Dad.  What?  One other thing, too.  What?  You gave me a list.  I thought she was going to click up and go, I got you.  Hang up on us.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You gave me $175.  You gave me $125.  Yes, I did.  Well, you made me a list of what to get you for your food.  I went out.  With my payroll check, I spent over $186 on you.  So?  Good.  Just because you wanted it, you know?  I'll wait for you.  You know what I need, Lynn?  Yeah.  Lynn, you know what I need? 
[01:12:30]  And I'll let you keep the dog if you do this.  I'll write the letter so you can keep the dog, Lynn.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Go to the supermarket.  Yeah.  All right?  How much money do you have on you right now?  $25.  $25.  I need $25 worth of gum out of the gumball machine.  For what reason?  I just need it.  Make sure you get nickels or whatever you need.  Oh, I will.  To do it.  $25 worth.  I'll let you out of the money.  Would that be okay to get it yourself?  No, you have to get it. 
[01:13:00]  And how am I going to give it to you?  How am I going to mail it or whatever?  I'm going to come there tonight.  And you better have the gumballs or I'll kill the dog.  Dad, you're not touching, Wachie.  Oh, dear.  You're not going there, Wachie.  No way.  I'll kill that dog.  Dad, you're not going there, Wachie.  Dad.  I'm alone.  Hey, Lynn.  No?  Lynn.  Lynn.  What?  You are a frigging lunatic.  You're insane.  Did you know that?  Oh, really?  You're crazy.  Yeah?  I'm not your father.  Opie isn't the father of your boyfriend. 
[01:13:30]  You're a kooky woman that needs medication.  Yeah, right.  Why don't you go to the hospital?  But I am your brother, and I do want you to drink from the dog's mule and then commit  suicide.  No way.  You're crazy.  You're a little wacky there, Lynn.  You're crazy.  What do you do for a living, Lynn?  I used to work for Papaginos.  Papaginos.  And that's what I was doing.  I left here all the time.  And then what?  And after that, I got pregnant, and here I am.  What?  What happened?  I left my job, got pregnant, and...  You got pregnant?  What did they do with the kid? 
[01:14:00]  I got it in my stomach.  What?  Never mind.  Where's your kid, Lynn?  Dead in her stomach?  Dad.  Dead?  No.  I said daddy.  No.  Daddy's home.  No.  Yeah, think about it.  Okay?  You know?  Lynn, where's your kid?  I'm due in August, daddy.  No, you're not.  I'm due in August.  You're not pregnant.  No one's banging you, Lynn.  No one's had sex with you, so how are you going to have a kid?  You don't think so, daddy?  How are you going to have a kid?  You don't think so, daddy? 
[01:14:30]  Not with my little girl.  Only I get to do that.  Daddy, don't even start, okay?  Yes.  I'll start again and again.  Yeah, don't start.  The baby's mine, Lynn.  The baby is mine.  Yeah.  It's your father's baby inside you.  No way.  Yes, it is.  I have no, dad.  I don't even want to, you know.  Didn't I tell you not to call daddy at work?  Yes, dad.  Didn't I tell you?  I know that.  I know that.  What's the punishment?  I know that.  What's the punishment for that, Lynn?  Dad, I know I don't want to call you when you're at the job. 
[01:15:00]  What's the punishment, baby?  What's the punishment, baby?  Dad, I know you don't want me calling you when you're at the job, okay?  I understand that.  Yes.  I haven't called you when you're at the job.  You have to suck daddy's mule.  I haven't called you when you're at the job.  Suck the mule, Lynn.  Get redemption and suck the mule.  Dad, I haven't called you at work.  It's almost two and a half weeks now, okay?  Don't call daddy at work or I have to come there and put my mule in your face.  Oh, I doubt it, dad.  I doubt it. 
[01:15:30]  Yes.  Yeah, the only thing I know is I want to get out of your apartment.  That's all I want to know.  So leave.  I don't want you there.  Thank you.  I don't want you there.  I have your permission to leave, right?  Get out.  I have your permission to leave, right?  Lynn, we've got to let you go.  Yeah.  Go get some medication.  Yep.  Okay.  Go to the hospital.  Mm-hmm.  Right now.  Yeah, right.  See how crazy you are?  Yeah, right.  Okay.  I'm coming home tonight.  I want you out of that place by the time I get home.  Dad, you won't come up here.  I guarantee it. 
[01:16:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Leave.  Okay, bye, dad.  Leave that house.  Yeah, you don't think you really think.  Leave.  Leave that house.  Pack up and leave right now because when I get home tonight, I don't want to see you there.  Okay.  Okay?  Yep.  Good.  Leave.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  It's called thinning the herd if she walks out in front of a bus or something.  Ugh.  I hate crazy people.  What a lunatic.  He's good.  First, her whole letter is backwards because then it turns out that I'm a daddy and Opie 
[01:16:30]  is the father of the kid that she's going out with.  Right.  And the kid is 37 years old.  Yeah.  You know what's annoying?  If she was hot, you know how easy she'd be to bang?  I know.  Why can't hot chicks be this crazy?  Why do crazy people have to love eating so much?  Because if she was hot, that call would have went completely different.  Yeah.  Why don't you take your panties off right now?  Get on a train.  Get off in Penn Station.  Get completely naked now.  Leave your house. 
[01:17:00]  Go ahead.  Just walk down the street.  We're always fat with a house dress and that thousand-yard marine stare.  That's so annoying.  Oh, God.  A thousand-yard.  Hi, Joker.  Just looking through walls with her x-ray vision.  Awful fat.  Wowie kazowie.  That was nuts.  She really is irritating.  She's got some problems.  A few issues.  I'm not your daddy.  Then a minute later, my daddy.  I like the dog to the house.  Daddy, no.  No, daddy.  I got no tolerance. 
[01:17:30]  I really, really.  I'm not talking about retarded people.  I'm talking about nuts.  Retarded people I empathize with, but nuts I just cannot stomach.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Right.  I don't know what we did right there, but that was a little bit of fun.  We did something.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst. 
[01:18:00]  Just screaming every racial epithet you can think of.  An abomination.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, but we've got to start the show how we started yesterday.  Lynn is calling back.  I see.  Lynn is calling back.  She sent us a letter.  She sent each of us a letter.  Letter each.  And explained how I'm her father.  We figured you're like 60 years old because she's 41 or 42.  And I'm her father.  And I'm her boyfriend's father. 
[01:18:30]  You're her boyfriend's father.  So we figured I'm about 57.  Yeah.  According to this girl, Lynn.  She's the real deal.  She's completely out of her mind.  Completely insane.  You've heard of these people.  They got delusions that they have relationships with people on the radio or on television or  whatnot.  And this woman, she's a woman.  She's not a girl.  She thinks that I'm her father.  And now we had a little problem yesterday.  She had called out or we called her.  She doesn't want to leave her apartment.  She wants to continue living there with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She lives way up in Massachusetts. 
[01:19:00]  But I live there with her.  And she wants her dog Rocky or Rock Dog or Rock T back or something.  And I yelled at her.  She's back with the figure $175.  Right.  $175.  She talks about this $175 over and over again.  So she's calling back because she thinks that she upset you yesterday, Anthony.  Right.  So why don't we plunk Lynn down here and talk to her again today and see what is going on  with Lynn.  And another thing, too, is I'm there.  Hey, Lynn.  Yeah?  Well, you're talking to Opie and Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  How are you?  Good.  How are you, Dad?  Oh, hi.  Hi, Lynn.  Hi, Dad.  It's Anthony.  I wanted to apologize for yesterday.  I'm very sorry.  What are you sorry about, Lynn?  We got into a big fight yesterday and I wanted to apologize.  And I decided I'm not going to leave.  You're not leaving?  No.  My little girl's going to be with me?  Exactly.  Oh, that's so good.  I'm so happy to hear that.  No, Dad, I owe you a big apology.  Yes, you do.  No, I'm very sorry.  Well, you better apologize.  Did you think about it all night long?  Yeah, I actually cried myself to sleep. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Wait, you cried yourself to sleep last night, Lynn?  Yeah, I slept on the sofa and I just cried myself to sleep.  So, Dad, you didn't get into last night, too late last night.  Yeah, I was very late last night.  Wow, she does know because I didn't even go home.  I went to bed, yeah.  Look at what I'm wearing.  I know.  Dad.  Yeah, Daddy.  It's the same stuff we were doing yesterday.  Lynn.  Dad.  What?  What did you buy me this morning?  Because Grammy's coming up at 3.30.  What did you buy me today?  Razor blades to slit your wrists with. 
[01:20:30]  What did I buy you?  Wait, wait, wait.  Lynn?  Yeah.  Lynn, this is Opie speaking.  I know.  Miss Dad.  You know, well, wait.  You know Joey's father?  Yes, Daddy.  No, Joey is my boyfriend, Daddy.  No, I know, but I'm Joey's father.  Yeah, but you're talking to Opie.  I know.  Put Dad on the phone.  I want to talk to my dad.  All right, but how late did Daddy come in?  I don't know.  I was starting to sleep when he came in.  I was just really tired, and I actually, I was so embarrassed.  I mean, I didn't mean to humiliate him or get him upset, but I feel really bad that, you know. 
[01:21:00]  Well, the problem is, Dad and I are always fighting and everything, but we make up and everything, so, you know.  Because I was going to ask Dad if he can mail me another $10 so I can go out.  You need $10?  I was going to see if Dad can mail me another $10.  The Dad mail made $10 last Friday, and I used it.  I wanted to see if Dad can lend me $10, and I'll be paying him back.  You know, you cost me a lot of money.  What was that, $350 for your teeth?  Dad, I know. 
[01:21:30]  And then there was $400 for your asthma stuff.  Dad, come on.  You're making me broke, damn it, Lynn.  Dad, I'm only asking for $10.  $10 here, and then it's $350 there, and then $175 there.  And before you know it, I'm broke.  I work for a living, Lynn, and you're sucking me dry.  Dad, I'm only going out with friends of mine.  What happened to the $350 I gave you?  I used it.  For what? 
[01:22:00]  I bought clothes.  I bought cosmetics.  What about the $400 I gave you?  That I used for my dog.  Well, you get no more money from me.  Dad, please.  I'm cutting you off.  Dad, I'm going out tonight.  Where are you going?  I'm going out with my girlfriend.  I'm going out for dinner tonight.  We're going to the, we're going to the, because of the, um, oh, I can't think of the name  of the restaurant.  You better think of it.  I know.  Well, if you don't want me to go out, I won't. 
[01:22:30]  You know, I'll sing it tonight, and I'll go out Wednesday, and I'll go out Thursday.  You left your asthma stuff in my room, and I almost broke it.  I know, Dad.  I know.  I promise.  That's exciting for me.  I guess you talked to her.  Dad, I promise you I will start using my nobilizer.  I promise.  Your what?  My nobilizer.  I promise I'll start using it.  Nobilizer.  Yeah.  That's her asthma stuff.  What?  The only thing is, okay, it causes side effects.  What's the side effects?  You know, when I'm on the nobilizer, it makes me really high and everything, and I wanted 
[01:23:00]  to see if people would call Dr. Patel to explain it to him, but I'm having a bad reaction from  it, and that's why I've been using it.  Yeah?  Aw.  What happens?  It makes you all funny?  Yeah, and I can handle it.  It hurts, Dad.  What hurts?  The nobilizer.  But what is it doing?  It makes you high like you're on drugs?  Yeah, exactly, and I don't like it, Dad.  What other kind of pills do you take?  I'm on breathine.  What is that? 
[01:23:30]  And what else are you taking, Lynn?  Just my inhalers, like I'm supposed to.  No, don't lie to your father.  Yeah, I swear.  You're lying to your father.  You're lying to your daddy.  Yeah, I have been using my inhalers.  You're doing drugs, Lynn.  What type of drugs do you take?  Dad, I'm on breathine.  I'm on my inhalers.  What other pills does the doctor give you?  You're a head doctor.  I don't have a head doctor.  You have a psychiatrist.  I used to a long time ago.  Yeah, then I dropped him.  You still do. 
[01:24:00]  No.  Lynn, did you ever see the David Lynch movie Mulholland Drive?  No.  Could you please explain it to me?  I'm going crazy for two days now.  I'm trying to figure out what it's about.  I went to all kinds of websites today and chat rooms, and I even went to message boards  about Mulholland Drive, because I have no idea what it's about, Lynn.  Yeah.  What is it about?  It's something like a girl goes to Hollywood, and she dies, but...  Dad, I want my license back.  Oh, is that what it's about?  Okay.  Yes.  All I want is my license back and my car.  Do you have your teeth in your mouth right now, Lynn? 
[01:24:30]  No.  Where are your teeth?  Where are your teeth?  They're right here.  Put your teeth in your mouth.  Dad, they are.  Put your teeth in.  Okay, they are.  When you talk to your father.  I have them in now.  Put them in.  I have them.  Shop them together so I can hear them go click, click, click.  Okay, Dad.  Okay.  Dad, I want to know...  Okay, Lynn.  Dad, Dad, what did you get me?  When you were not shopping for me, what did you get me?  Oh, what was that thing you wanted? 
[01:25:00]  I know.  I know.  What was that thing?  What's the thing you want the most, most, ever, ever, ever, Lynn?  What I really want, Dad, is my car back and my license back.  Your car and your license.  You know what Daddy did for you?  What?  Lynn?  What?  You know what Daddy did?  No, what?  Because he loves his little girl so much?  I understand that.  I got your car and your license back.  And can I have it mailed out to me?  I'm bringing them tonight.  It's hard to mail a car, Lynn.  When I come home, I'm driving up in your car.  And I'm giving you your license back. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, great.  Can we go over for dinner tonight?  You got it.  I want to go to Burger King.  You want to go to Burger King?  Yeah, I want to go to a fast place.  You want to go to Burger King?  Yes, I really want to.  I want to get a chocolate milkshake.  But your ass is so fat, Lynn.  Dad, I know.  The burgers go right to your...  We won't even discuss that.  They go to your big fat ass, Lynn.  Yeah, we won't even...  We won't get into that.  I have a picture of you right now.  I'm looking at your disgusting fat ass.  What's wrong with you?  Why don't you eat something light like a salad instead of the Burger King? 
[01:26:00]  I don't like salads.  You know, I had to get your car back and put new shocks in because your big fat ass wore  out the shock absorbers.  Dad, I understand that.  I promise.  Really.  I'm so ashamed of you as my daughter.  Dad.  I'm ashamed.  I'm ashamed to have you as a daughter.  I want to disown you.  Dad, please.  I'm giving you away.  I'm bringing you back to that place, Lynn.  I'm putting you back in the home.  No.  Dad, I want to stay here at your apartment. 
[01:26:30]  No.  That's all I want.  I'm going to hang up on you, Lynn, and never talk to you again.  Bye, Dad.  Never.  Have it your way.  I'm having it my way.  Great.  All right.  Okay.  Bye, Dad.  Love you.  Love you too, Dad.  Okay.  Thanks, Obie.  Yeah.  Love you, Dad.  Daddy.  Okay, I'll go out to dinner with you tonight.  We'll go to Burger King.  Daddy.  Can we?  Yeah.  Daddy loves you.  Dad.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Dad, Dad, Dad.  I'm a thing.  Oh, what, what, what?  What, daughter?  Dad, I've been, you know how I've been smoking since I was 14 years old.  Yes.  I want to go see a hypnotist. 
[01:27:00]  Pink tip white owl.  Yeah, my birthday is next month and I want to go see a hypnotist because I want to quit smoking cigarettes.  How about, um, how about Creskin?  No.  Oh, you want to see a hypnotist?  Yeah, because I can't use the patch or anything.  I don't want to go see a hypnotist.  Why can't you use the patch?  Because I can't handle it.  Because your other medicine that you're on, Lynn, that you're not telling Daddy about.  Dad, you want to see me?  If you come here tonight, you'll see it, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Really, Dad, the only thing I'm asking is for 10 bucks for tonight. 
[01:27:30]  No.  I mean, for tomorrow night.  I've given you enough money.  You're going to get enough money for a little cheeseburger.  Yeah.  And French fries and a small Coke at Burger King.  Yeah, please.  Because your ass is so fat that I'm embarrassed to have you as a fat-ass daughter.  Yeah, but we're only going out for dinner Thursday night.  Do you know what my co-workers say?  What?  They say, how can you even go out with your daughter, Lynn, because she's got such a big fat ass?  Everyone's telling me that, and I'm ashamed of you.  I'm embarrassed and ashamed of you. 
[01:28:00]  I'm sorry, Dad.  You can't be sorry enough.  I'll make it up, I promise.  You'll never be able to make it up.  But Daddy loves you.  I love you too, Dad.  I mean, he really loves you.  Will you say I'll talk to you tonight?  Oh, Daddy loves you.  Will you love me tonight, Dad?  Oh, Daddy loves you.  I love you too, Dad.  Just talk a little more.  Dad, I want to find out what you want.  I want you to tell me what you brought me.  Oh, keep talking, Lynn.  Daddy really loves you.  Dad, use your head.  Use your head.  Daddy really loves you. 
[01:28:30]  Take your teeth out.  Huh?  Take your teeth out right now.  Okay.  Okay.  Because that's how Daddy likes it.  Take them out.  Now, hit them against the telephone.  Huh?  Hit the teeth.  See them out, Dad.  Dad, I promise.  Why is I using my new blood?  Dad, I'll make a deal with you.  Could you bite the phone now without your teeth in it?  Let me hear that.  How can I bite the phone without my teeth?  Just bite it.  Gum it.  You know, I did it by the horse.  Dad, can I ask you a question? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, can I ask you a question?  Of course, daughter.  If I start using my nobilizer like I'm supposed to four times a day,  could I please send my license and my car back?  Your license and your car?  Yeah, if I start using my nobilizer.  All right.  Daddy loves you.  And I promise you, you'll be here tonight when you're going to kick him home.  Well, you said, but I'll take it out and I'll start using it if I get my license and my car back.  All right.  Daddy loves you and he's got to go.  Can you call me?  Dad, call me back tonight.  Dad?  Daddy loves you.  Daddy, call me back tonight.  Okay. 
[01:29:30]  Where's Rocky?  Rocky is with Grammy's house.  All right.  We got to go, Lynn.  Daddy loves you always.  You'll call me tonight, Dad?  Yes.  Put your goddamn teeth in.  Dad.  What did I tell you?  I know.  Put them in.  Yeah, they're in.  They hurt.  I don't care.  Keep them in.  If I come home and your teeth are out, I'm going to beat you.  Daddy, I promise.  Keep your teeth in.  I am, Daddy.  I don't care how much they hurt.  Daddy, I am.  They're in right now.  Put the teeth in the dirty spot.  She doesn't win. 
[01:30:00]  What did you just hit the phone on?  My teeth.  Hit him again.  You just did that.  Hit him harder.  I can't hear.  See, I just did.  Yeah, can I ask a question?  One more, and then I got to go.  Okay.  Were you telling me what you brought me?  That Grammy's coming up at 3.30.  Were you telling me what you brought me?  It's very special.  It'll be a surprise.  You call us after Grammy gives you your gift.  I really promise.  Okay.  I'll call you back, okay?  Daddy loves you.  I love you, Dad.  Hey, Mariah, did you get a new record deal? 
[01:30:30]  I love you, Daddy.  I told you don't call me at work.  I know.  All right, bye.  Bye, you man.  Are you going to call me or what?  Daddy loves his fat little girl.  I know.  I don't do, Daddy.  Daddy loves his slut girl.  So you'll call me later?  You're Daddy's slut girl.  Dad?  Yes?  You're Daddy's slut girl.  If you don't want me calling you, you'll call me, little one?  I'll call you tonight.  Okay, love you, Dad.  Keep your teeth in.  I will, Dad.  Stay by the phone.  I'm going to call you soon.  Okay.  I am going downstairs at 3.30 to see Grammy with my things that you brought me. 
[01:31:00]  Good, good, good.  Dad, I want to...  Knock your teeth again.  Yes, right here, Dad.  If you lose your teeth, I'm going to kill you.  Daddy, I promise I won't.  Don't lose your teeth.  Daddy, I won't.  I swear I won't.  I know.  Don't lose your teeth.  I understand that, Daddy.  Dad, can I talk to Opie for a minute?  Dad?  Yes.  Can I talk to Opie?  Yes, Lynn.  Opie, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Can you try to talk to my dad into giving me $10 for Thursday? 
[01:31:30]  All right, I'll try, Lynn.  Please.  I want to go all Thursday night with my girlfriends.  We got to go, Lynn.  Okay, tell Dad to call him, okay?  People are really hating us.  We got to go.  Okay, love you, Dad.  All right, we love you, too.  Okay, love you.  Both of us love you.  I know.  I know I love my boyfriend's dad, too.  You know, he's good.  All right.  So I'll talk to you tonight, Dad.  All right, yes.  And since you don't want me calling you anymore, right?  Stop talking so much.  I'm done.  I'm leaving.  You don't want me calling you anymore, Dad?  Hit your teeth again. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, you don't want me calling you anymore, so you'll call me, right?  I will call you tonight.  Okay, great.  Love you, Dad.  Lovely daughter.  Okay, love you, Dad.  Bye-bye.  Okay, bye, Dad.  Hit your teeth.  I know.  People hate that.  Oh, God damn.  That's fantastic.  That girl is cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Oh, my God.  That is fantastic.  Hey, it makes me laugh to talk to her.  It really is fun. 
[01:32:30]  It's just interactive cuck.  Hit your teeth.  Hit your teeth.  That's my whole gimmick with her.  I just want to do with the teeth.  Make them take her out.  Make her take the teeth out.  Put them in.  I want to make her get something out of the fridge that's really hard to eat.  Have faith in us.  We'll make something out of this.  We'll make something.  There's still a big lump of clay in front of us, but we're starting to mold something.  It's in the pupa phase.  It really is.  Don't worry.  It'll be a beautiful butterfly someday.  Other radio shows develop this stuff behind the scenes? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, no.  We give you the mess right on the air live.  See?  Now we're thinking teeth.  Now we're thinking smash your teeth over and over again.  It could be something fun.  Very funny that she bleeds from the mouth.  It hurts, Daddy.  It hurts.  Developing the bits right in front of you.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  That's how it works.  All right, Ant.  We'll take a break and we'll continue, all right?  Great.  This is the Iceman, Chuck Liddell, UFC light heavyweight champ.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Listener, I'll kick your ass.  Now we got a junk doctor on the line, too. 
[01:33:30]  Dr. Whitehead is his name, and he's a penis surgeon.  Dr. Whitehead.  Yeah, this is Dr. Whitehead.  Hi, Dr. Whitehead.  You are on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, boy.  This ain't going to be the first one.  I know that.  And we want to know a little bit about what you do, Dr. Whitehead.  Well, Dr. Whitehead is a urologist in New York City, and the organization is New York  Phalloplasty.  Uh-huh. 
[01:34:00]  And what we do is we make patients longer and wider.  Oh, you do, do you?  Really?  And that is done through, now, I've heard other methods that are used.  What is your method?  Well, there are different methods.  We're talking about surgery.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  The surgical techniques can either be a fat injection technique for widening or putting  in some of the patient's own skin for widening, or the technique that I prefer, which I consider  to be the state of the art, is donated skin from the cadaver. 
[01:34:30]  It's like a kidney transplant or a heart transplant.  All right.  Slow the F down.  Can I stop now?  Slow the F down.  Hold the phone now, Dr. Whitehead.  Dead guy skin on your junk to make it bigger.  We take skin from the cadaver, which is purified.  Purified cadaver skin.  How do you purify dead guy skin?  Well, it goes to a laboratory.  It's called the tissue laboratory.  A laboratory. 
[01:35:00]  And then?  And it makes it pure, so there's no transmission of any disease, and we put that into the patient's  penis to make it wider.  No, no, wait a minute.  You put it underneath the skin of your own member?  Well, not of my member, but of the patient's member.  And it's just, it's skin, but it doesn't really, you don't see it on the outside.  You don't see it on the outside.  It's the undersurface of the skin called the dermis.  So you're doubling up the skin.  That's right.  It's a dermal matrix graft. 
[01:35:30]  To get that Italian tuna can type of schlong, as opposed to the big, long, negro schlongs.  Yeah, what if the cadaver is Japanese, doctor?  Oh, yes.  What race is the best to use for the skin for the member widening?  Well, guess what?  God made the inside of the dermis exactly the same on all races.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  They're all pink on the inside.  I'll listen to Dr. Whitehead if that's your real name.  Sir, is there a scar on the mule from the surgery? 
[01:36:00]  Ooh.  There is no scar from the donation of the site because it's coming freely from somebody else that's deceased, which is really an advance.  But what about your own member?  Does that get scarred?  Yes, of course.  Whenever you do surgery, you have to make an incision.  Well, where do you make the incision?  Hold on.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  Where is it?  There's two incisions.  There's one in the pubic hair, so it's concealed.  Okay.  And there's one right behind the head of the penis in that little valley. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  And that's also actually concealed.  It is.  So it's almost not noticeable.  Whenever a surgeon does any surgery, there's always a scar, and we always have to see it's noticeable.  But with a very fine plastic surgical technique.  Colin is now looking for the valley right now.  He's searching down his path.  Look for the valley.  I need it on the valley. 
[01:37:00]  Now, is it on the top side of the unit or the bottom side that you're talking about?  Oh, it's on the bottom side.  You're absolutely right.  You were right the first time.  It's on the top side.  If you look at the penis head on, it's from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock.  So it's just the top half.  All right.  Where's the valley there?  There's no valley there.  Yes, it is.  He's talking about where the helmets stop.  Oh, okay.  Right there.  That's more of a...  I think that's more of a wall than a valley.  Yeah.  It's like a mesa. 
[01:37:30]  It's more of a mesa.  It's a nice area to run a tongue over.  It's a delta.  Is it a plateau?  Yeah.  Something like that.  It's the last part of the rock climb.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, valleys are very...  You always have that...  A valley, you have to dip down first and then come back up.  We're looking, if you go across the top of your junk, you're hitting the helmet.  It's like an overhang.  It's behind the overhang.  All right.  It's concealed right in the valley, which is really nice.  Why the shatter?  That's great. 
[01:38:00]  Stop saying valley.  Hey, Doc, do you get to last longer because you've got dead guy skin on your junk?  Oh, does it affect the sensation, Dr. Whitehead?  It's a good question.  It's actually two questions.  First of all, you don't get to last longer because it's got nothing to do with sexual  function.  Uh-huh.  And because it's dead guy skin, it means nothing.  It's put in there.  It's like the scaffolding on a building.  Only dead guy scaffold.  What happens is you're putting in the dead person, the cadaver's skin, which has been  purified, and your own skin goes in there to make it really your own. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  It becomes your own.  So you've got a double thickness.  Where do you take the skin from if it's your own?  You don't take it from yourself.  That's the beauty of it.  So there's no donor sites.  There's no intuition.  Where do you take it from on the cadaver, then?  It comes from the tissue bank.  I have no idea.  Man, that's God's little joke on everybody.  You're a straight guy.  You die.  And your skin is used.  Used in another man's junk.  And it might be a day guy.  And it could be that you are not putting the skin of a man ass around your junk. 
[01:39:00]  Listen, don't bury your organs.  God needs them here on earth.  I'll bury my organ whenever I want.  Dr. Whitehead.  Colin Quinn wants to speak.  I like burying my organ while I'm alive.  Dr. Whitehead.  Colin Quinn has a question.  Dr., do you think you'll ever have a client from either Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant, or Brownsville in your entire life?  Absolutely.  Come on now.  Let's don't be ridiculous.  I've had them.  Really?  I'm going to tell you something remarkable.  You want to listen carefully now? 
[01:39:30]  I'm listening so carefully.  Are you listening?  Yes.  Virtually all of the men that have this surgery are completely normal.  They just want to be larger.  Are you hung, Doc?  They just want to be larger.  Do you do it yourself, Doc?  I do the surgery myself.  Have you had it done on yourself?  No, sir.  No, you're fine with your manhood.  You got a large mule?  It's called perceived penile inadequacy.  The guys are normal.  They would just like to be larger, and we're able to do it.  What if your girlfriend has that? 
[01:40:00]  Are you happy with your size, Doc?  I'm very happy with mine.  Now, what is the guy like?  Well, you're saying that the guys that come to have this done are of normal, average size?  They're all normal.  Well, very, very few are very small, and just the same very, very few are, you know, right  on the top percentage.  But, Doc, I have a question.  What if you're doing the surgery, and you don't put the skin in properly, and then some  girl goes home with a mouthful of dead skin?  Oh, God. 
[01:40:30]  Norton, that could not possibly happen.  Norton, please.  We're talking with Dr. White.  Whoever asked that question doesn't understand what I said.  Absolutely.  That's Jim Norton, and he's an idiot, and he'll be appearing at Town Hall.  April 18th.  If you want to see more of his idiocy.  Doc.  Yep.  That's fantastic.  Now, let me ask you something.  What is average diameter or circumference, and what do you then boost it up to?  Okay.  The average length is about six inches or five and a half inches. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  Now, we're talking in the flaccid state.  Right.  And the width is about eight centimeters.  Centimeters?  What the hell's a centimeter?  What's a centimeter?  Divide an inch by 2.54.  Isn't that a centimeter?  That's a centimeter.  What are you saying centimeter for?  That's annoying me.  It's a centimeter.  C-E-N-T centimeter. 
[01:41:30]  It's not the Washington Monument.  It's cent.  What are you, McDonald?  About eight centimeters is about two and a half inches.  You're about two and a half inches in flaccid circumference.  By six?  Two and a half by six soft?  Who's got that?  That's a lot.  Six soft?  That's stretched out, right?  That's a big mouthful of mule.  No, we're talking the stretch.  Big, delicious mouthful of mule.  That's a big, delicious, lucky boy to get a hold of that mouthful.  Sometimes you're standing around, you're comparing with your friends, you're all laughing. 
[01:42:00]  Doc?  Yes, Doc?  I'm still here.  Is it okay to be a grower instead of a shower?  Let me get this right now.  The average stretch length is about six inches.  Right.  Five and a half to six.  Now, the flaccid length, the average, is about two and a half inches.  Okay.  Okay?  And what we're able to do, and I hope you guys are sitting down and you're serious, because  this is serious stuff, okay?  Absolutely.  Because these guys are normal, and they want to have elective surgery, because they want  to feel better about themselves. 
[01:42:30]  Right.  Okay?  We're able to give them approximately one inch added length, an approximately 30% increase  in circumference.  That's about a one-third.  Wow.  All right.  How do you make it longer?  What we do is we release the suspensory ligament.  Yeah.  Okay.  I've heard of this.  Let me explain and tell me if I'm right.  You kind of cut down near the, can we say the base?  It's the base, right? 
[01:43:00]  And then you pull like it's a cord from a vacuum cleaner.  The last part I don't get.  The first part you were right.  Well, you know those vacuum cleaners were-  The retractable cord?  Exactly.  You know where the cord is-  He's a cleaning lady.  He's a doctor.  Come on.  And you pull the vacuum cord out, let's say.  From the vacuum.  Let me put it in a way that you can understand, because you know what?  I hope you've got 100,000 viewers, but you're confusing them. 
[01:43:30]  Viewers are looking at their radio like-  Let me, radio, let them visualize this, okay?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  The penis, half of the penis is actually inside the body.  Not the tasty half.  The penis is-  No, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  Dr. Whitehead, what are they dumping out of?  Can I explain something to you real quickly first?  We have a problem on this station with the word penis.  If it's used in any other context, then probably just the way I said it. 
[01:44:00]  So what you have to do, if you could, for us, is say member.  Okay.  We'll talk about the member.  Yes, thank you.  Half of the member is inside the body, and the other half is on the outside, and it takes  a course.  It goes up towards the ceiling, and it attaches to the pubic bone.  The half that's in Jim is someone else's, by the way, which is strange.  What you see hanging on the outside is the outside, so there's actually a V, so what we  do is we release the top of that V, which is touched to the bone, pubic bone, and now 
[01:44:30]  the penis does not become any longer, or the member.  Oh, the member.  You said the yummy word again.  The member does not become any longer.  What happens is that a little bit of what is inside is now brought to the outside, and  it appears longer.  But isn't that also supposed to be there to hold things up to attention?  No.  Like a mast?  Won't it actually now not face north, but somewhere in the easterly direction? 
[01:45:00]  That's a wonderful question, because many people have asked that, and if the surgery  is done correctly, and the release is not too far back, there should be no instability.  The penis would still point up.  It's a very, very unusual surgery.  Oh, the member.  Yeah.  Oh, the member.  Yeah, we're getting things.  Jerry Falwell is cutting out of everything.  See, we have a dump guy, he's called, and he dumps out of our show with a digital delay, 
[01:45:30]  Dr. Whitehead, and he is cutting, much like you do that tasty ligament, he is cutting  out of our show.  Why does he cut out of the show when you can say this kind of stuff on Lovelines if it's  talked about medically?  Because that's after 10 o'clock.  It's called a safe harbor, Jim.  We're talking about the members.  But we are talking about this in a way that I do believe would be fine and dandy.  No one's goofing on it.  I know.  It's something this doctor does.  And let me tell you something. 
[01:46:00]  And if it would be advertised on this show, they'd be able to say it, right?  Yeah.  Right?  As long as the vultures could get their talons into some cash.  Now, doctor, let me ask you a hypothetical question.  What if you got a guy whose member already kind of leans a little too far to the left?  Hypothetically.  I'm not talking about anyone in particular.  Okay, most of the time...  This thing leans to the left.  Most of the time, when that happens, that's entirely normal.  Really?  If there is a problem with erections, sometimes the member will bend...  Wait, wait, you cannot say that because the dump guy is going to dump out of that. 
[01:46:30]  Can you believe what we have to deal with here?  Ridiculous.  Can you believe what we have to deal with?  We want to talk openly and honestly about what you do, Dr. Whitehead.  But we have a dump guy and someone censoring our program.  Although he may not be dumping out of this.  He may be whacking his bag listening.  Yeah, I think that's probably closer to what's going on.  Guys, that's not going to help you get what you want.  You know, everything's political.  All right, go ahead, Mr. Whitehead. 
[01:47:00]  Well, Dr. Whitehead, he's saying that it's normal.  It's normal if it hangs one way or the other.  All right.  And, Doctor, we're getting a lot of questions.  How much does each of these procedures run?  Well, we really haven't talked about the procedures.  We ought to be specific.  There's one procedure to make the member longer.  Yes.  There's another procedure to make it whiter.  Most of the guys wish to have the member made longer and whiter at the same time. 
[01:47:30]  Sir, I have a question for you.  Is there anything you could put on the end of it so that when a woman is, say, finished servicing, that she just dies?  Would you stop it, Norton?  Dr. Whitehead, I apologize for Jim Norton.  Dr. Whitehead, it's ridiculous.  If you want to see what he looks like so you can hate him more, just go to eatabullet.com.  He's already got me in Dutch with Barry Williamstock.  You know what?  If you guys are talking about the websites, tell your listeners to... 
[01:48:00]  Oh, oh.  Tell your listeners.  Now, hold on now.  Sit down and relax.  All right, I'm relaxed.  Tell your listeners to look at this website.  It's www.drwhitehead.com.  Oh.  You got pictures of the procedure?  Drwhitehead.com.  All right.  You've got pictures of before and afterwards.  You do.  And everybody will understand what we're able to do.  Drwhitehead.com. 
[01:48:30]  Ah!  Wow.  Wow.  Sir, there's a black one.  Did they paint the head red?  No, you can't.  Why?  You can see what happened.  What is this guy, Norton again?  We've got to get rid of him.  I know.  We're trying.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, but those are two different...  Look.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, that's a...  I think the second one is more delicious and appetizing.  Are you guys pulling up my website now?  Yeah, we're looking at it now.  Yes, we are looking at the before and after shots.  I want to see the widening pictures. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  That's what I want to see.  But it's going to be very hard to get to these pictures because people are not pounding the website.  But, Doc, you are going to get so many hits on your website.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we send out packages to everybody that contacts us.  Packages.  It's got a lot of information.  It's a big one.  Yeah.  I like a wide and long one.  Well, it's froze up now, see, and your website getting pounded.  Tom has a question.  Let's go to Tom. 
[01:49:30]  Tom, you got a question for the good doctor?  Tom?  Hello?  Oh, yeah.  Speak, you jackass.  Tom.  Tom.  Talk.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, yeah.  You sang hello like a moron.  What's your name?  Dr. Whitehead.  Hold on.  What's your name?  John.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Sorry, man.  Hey, Dr. Whitehead, if surrounding the mule with dead skin makes it larger, wouldn't  Jeffrey Dahmer have the largest slung in the world? 
[01:50:00]  No.  What type of mule?  Be serious.  Dr. Whitehead, I apologize.  We'll get rid of him, too.  Yes.  Goodbye, Tom, John, whatever your name is.  This is a serious conversation.  Yeah.  And we don't appreciate questions like that.  Well, let me go to Scott.  He has a question for the good doctor.  Scott?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, if you put all this skin around the shaft, want to make your head look real small?  Good question.  What's your name?  That is Scott.  Scott. 
[01:50:30]  This guy, Scott, deserves a medal.  Scott, listen to me carefully, all right?  You listening?  Yeah, I got you.  Remember what I told you?  There's a few different techniques of making the penis whiter.  Can't say that word because...  Oh, the member whiter.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yep, talking about the member.  Okay, there's a few different techniques.  Yep.  The one technique that does do that at times, at times, is the fat injection.  Oh.  Where fat is taken by needle and inject from the various parts of the body and injected  in the penis. 
[01:51:00]  Or member.  Well, with a member.  Sir?  And instead of doing that...  Do you have Alzheimer's?  Can I...  He's a doctor, though.  Can I ask you one more question?  No, I haven't answered this one.  No, he's not done yet.  Oh, okay, okay.  Forget it.  We got the member.  If you inject it with fat, sometimes too much fat can be put in.  That's not the technique that I consider the best.  Although a lot of people do it.  That's just the opposite of being drunk, where you get drunk and then inject it into fat.  The surgeon would inject it.  The surgeon would not be drunk.  Right.  With the graft technique, with the dermal matrix graft from the cadaver, which is the best, 
[01:51:30]  you will not have any disproportion.  That's what we call it.  There's no disproportion between the head and the member.  All right, listen, we got so many questions coming in, Doc.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, you got a serious question for Dr. Whitehead.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Doctor, I was wondering if you could do a procedure to make my gonads look like two 12-pound shot puts.  Do you do anything with the other part of the area, which we like to call, 
[01:52:00]  and we will continue calling, the yam bag?  Yeah, he wants his yam bag.  Okay, he wants to talk about the yam bag and the gonads.  Yes.  That's not something that I take care of.  Oh, no?  You might, if you look very difficult, I mean, you can look.  There is a surgeon in Florida that does put caps around the testicles to make the testicles appear wider.  He puts what around them?  They are caps. 
[01:52:30]  Like hats?  Well, okay, you can say like a cap around the testicle to make it wider and bigger.  A little baseball cap type thing?  That surgery does exist.  I do not do it.  Right.  That's interesting.  Ow, I am really getting a bad feeling.  And if somebody is interested in that, all they have to do is call me and I'll give you his phone number.  All right.  Sounds fun.  Joe has a serious question for you.  Joe, you have a question for Dr. Whitehead?  Yeah, I want to know if he taste tests every member he does. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Enough, Joe.  Joe.  Dr. Whitehead, we apologize.  Don't apologize.  We'll just get rid of him.  Some of our listeners.  Yeah, it looked like it was a legit question and he kind of tricked us there a little bit.  Smarten up, Joe.  That wasn't what he had written down as we screened the calls, Dr. Whitehead.  You understand how this goes with a radio live program like this.  We can't tell exactly what the people are going to ask when they call up.  So, indeed, we do apologize.  Yes.  You know what?  Steve looks like he has a serious question.  Steve, you have a question for Dr. Whitehead. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, Dr. Whitehead.  This procedure...  Wait a minute.  Dr. Whitehead, are you still there?  I'm here.  All right.  Steve, please.  A good question.  I'm very interested in this procedure.  I just have one question.  Yes.  After you're done donating the tissue from the cadaver, can I meet the cadaver to throw in a quick one to thank it?  Say it again.  I want to bang the cadaver.  Is my way of thanking it for donating the tissue to my schlong?  Oh, good question.  That's a great question.  I'm sorry.  I can't even come close to answering that.  Again?  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:00]  Why do we get these callers?  Well, I like to clarify it when he rephrased it.  Yes, he did.  I've been a liar.  Well, Jim looks like he's going to get us back on the right...  Finally, I can read what this man is going to ask, and that's a legitimate question.  Yes, Jim, a question for Dr. Whitehead.  Yeah, Dr. Whitehead.  I wanted to know if you could make my member into the shape of a triangle.  All right.  Kind of like just a triangle.  That isn't what you...  You were going to ask something else, and I am getting very upset now. 
[01:54:30]  You guys are embarrassing us.  It would be interesting for a circus sideshow.  Very, very funny, Jim.  Is there any type of shapes you could do with this procedure there, Dr. Whitehead?  We make it into it, believe it or not.  We try to reproduce the exact shape you have.  You want to make it bigger?  That's all.  We're not going to change the shape.  We're going to make it nice and cylindrical so it looks just larger.  Joe?  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  Not much.  Dr. Whitehead, I want to thank you. 
[01:55:00]  I have this procedure done.  Oh, yeah?  I have the skin of a cadaver made to have my member made wider.  Oh, nice.  Congrats.  I want to thank you for this.  How'd it work out for you?  And great.  If I could steal Norton's best line now, it's big and meaty and lovable like Mitch Green's  face.  And, doctor, let me ask you a question.  How many times have you seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  Would you say that again, please?  Why would you ask that, Joe? 
[01:55:30]  Well, let's find out.  Well, my girlfriend now calls my member Leather Junk.  Doc, nothing happens after time goes by that affects down there.  This is time-tested.  That skin won't dry up and look like beef jerky?  Okay.  That's a fair question.  Whoever asked it.  That's Anthony.  I'm the one who tries to keep this show on an even keel.  Anthony, you're the main man, okay?  Thank you, Dr. Whitehead.  I'm glad you asked a good question.  Hey, guys?  Yes, Joe?  One more quick one. 
[01:56:00]  I'm sorry.  No, Joe.  Let me get an answer to this one.  I know, Dr. Whitehead.  Anthony.  My friend wants to have the procedure done also.  All right.  Do you, Dr. Whitehead, do any preliminary oral examinations?  Anthony, I'm going to answer your question, okay?  Thank you, Dr. Whitehead.  Please hang up on that caller.  Take care, gentlemen.  That caller.  Thank you, Joe.  All right.  Yes, Dr. Whitehead.  The technique that I'm talking about, which I do exclusively and have been using it only for  the last four years, that's the only technique I use, and I've used other techniques 
[01:56:30]  in the past.  I'm talking about the allograft dermal matrix graft.  That's what I was talking about.  Yeah, we're talking about the same things, so we're on the same page.  That's been used now for four years for this application.  It seems that the graft dimensions do not change.  If it does change, and let's assume that the average person gets about 30%, so that's about  a one-inch increase in circumference.  Yeah.  Over a period of time, they might lose 10% or 20% of that one inch. 
[01:57:00]  Silent game.  So it seems to be very satisfactory.  It seems to be durable.  It seems to be permanent up to approximately four years.  So I'm very happy about it, and so are my guys.  Are you there, Anthony?  Hello?  He can't hear us, right?  No.  He can't hear us.  We'll get at least another hello, Adam. 
[01:57:30]  Another hello.  Come on, try.  He hasn't given the number out.  He's got to stay on the line.  Oh, he slammed that phone down.  Wow.  He's angry.  He actually was talking with his junk.  He has a prehensile junk, which you can buy from him also.  He puts a monkey tail in there, and you can swing from a tree.  We'll buy it.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, hi. 
[01:58:00]  I wanted to ask the doctor.  I told him that I was a patient of his last year, and I'm a black man.  And I went to a nude beach.  I was just wondering, how do I get, when I do the backstroke, how do I get people to  stop yelling shark?  That would have been a great question.  What do you say you get the good doctor back?  No, no, no, no.  No, I am not calling that man.  I think he'll call us back.  Go away.  Yeah, he'll call us back.  His technique of making it bigger is actually a lot better than mine.  And I would just cut fat off my meat, like when I was eating, and just tape it to my 
[01:58:30]  mule.  Just duct tape it.  Oh, God.  You know, he gives a website out that has more man junk on it than any gay porno site.  It should be yummy.  And Norton would know.  YummyMouthful.com.  Hey, this is Quentin Tarantino, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  It's a madhouse.  We've got to calm down, man.  I've got to tell you right now.  The worst.  I am the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Oi.  It's like a soap opera today.  It certainly is.  Now we've got to get Paranoid Anthony in here. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, it's time we realize it, that we start weeding out some of the old lunatics from this program.  And maybe make room for new people.  I don't know what's going to happen after this.  But the bottom line is, we've had some of these people around much too long.  And one last shot to make an impact.  Let the audience decide if they're contributing members to this program or just dead weight. 
[02:00:00]  I'm dead weight.  See, he had to say something.  So you could say, hey, you know, we've got to get rid of any guy that wants to take a big C in his A and suck on C.  I would do that.  Yes.  Yes.  You say anything just to be able to talk on the air.  Look at those big, dopey headphones they gave you.  It's not nice.  Why are you here?  I'm talking to Rossi.  Weren't you just on the phone?  Yes.  So why are you here?  Because I'm talking to Rossi.  Why? 
[02:00:30]  On the floor of the 68th Democratic National Convention.  You need the big antennas sticking out of your headphones.  That's funny, man.  I'm thinking it's Ron Kulvix.  Am I wrong?  No, it was Dan Rather.  It was Dan Rather.  Yeah.  And he got in a little tussle.  A little pushing match.  Look at you.  What are you looking at?  Things are hot, huh?  What?  Feeling the pressure right now?  No.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Everything good?  I'm in a barrel and I'm doing the best I can. 
[02:01:00]  You have nothing.  You have nothing, do you?  No, I came in the store.  Actually, I was seeing Rossi.  It was business.  Hey, this is what 22 Cities wants to hear.  It was business.  You're saying, oh, no, I just came to see Rossi.  What do you want?  Talk to me?  Thank you, Angel.  Please?  I have nothing.  Nothing.  You were on the phone with us a few minutes ago.  It didn't go well.  No, I was trying to defend him because I know she was...  No, no.  Forget about what you were trying to do.  But then now you're here for business.  What?  You were on the phone a few minutes ago.  Yes. 
[02:01:30]  Bitching and complaining.  And now you decided...  And you know what?  Now I'm intrigued.  I want to hear him try to defend me.  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  No, because I know what's been going on for the four years.  You, more so than anybody, I've been here more than anybody in the beginning.  Not in the last two years, in the beginning.  And I see how she would sit there...  Get out of my way.  How she would sit there and stare at you and everything else.  It was an obsession for her.  She did not belong underneath those steps, sitting there every night, sleeping. 
[02:02:00]  And that's the bottom line.  And Ann can laugh at me.  And Norton's just...  She didn't belong in this place.  She was stalking you.  And that's the bottom line.  That's a brilliant analysis.  No, am I wrong?  No.  The lady was here.  She would sit here.  She was partying.  Now you get the hell out of here!  All right.  Now you're talking about Patty and not yourself, right?  No.  Well, you...  You're a dick.  Mister, I gotta bring presents every time I come by.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  So I could feel loved when they go, oh, wow, Anthony, thank you.  You didn't bring anything today? 
[02:02:30]  You're so thoughtful.  I will go downstairs if you want, and we'll get it, and we'll hang.  No, I guarantee he bought something.  Now we said...  I don't want anything!  We weren't giving you anything.  What's talking about?  We're giving...  Oh, my God.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  This is what I was going to say, and I think Ant and I know you at this point.  You were on the phone.  You were coming to the radio station.  You definitely had a gift for Anthony and I.  We kind of made fun of that while we were talking to you on the phone.  You decided to leave that gift in your limo. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  No.  Ask Jamaican Mike to go in there right now.  There's nothing in there.  Absolutely not.  You just said I could go downstairs and get it.  I'll go down to the liquor store if we want Dom Perignon.  I'll go down to...  If you want to go across the street to the Hot Rock, we'll get wings.  Things that I've done before in the last two years.  Okay?  Mister, I am on the hot seat, so just...  I don't know what to do right now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  I know.  I don't know. 
[02:03:30]  Dude, the whole...  Wait.  I have been honest through this whole thing.  I know you have.  I know exactly what I...  Dude, he's implying that you're picking on him.  This is what he's implying, that you can't handle the heat, and you're picking on him.  That's what he's saying.  Well, he always picks it.  No, but you're saying...  What did you say?  We don't take limos.  Quote, unquote, yesterday.  Did you say that yesterday?  And you don't.  You don't.  We don't.  No.  I know that.  On a rare occasion, sure.  No, for family and friends and everything else.  All I was saying...  Hold on.  No.  Not even that.  You've given me town cars, which is nice. 
[02:04:00]  Technical staff.  Don't get technical right now.  I used a limo once.  I was 30 minutes late, and I was.  No, it was always cool after you do town hall to be standing out there at 3 in the morning  with your parents.  The car should be here soon, Mom.  Jim Norton...  That's a true story.  Jim gets a car from Limo Ant.  I want a limo by Paris.  I don't want to trash your business.  Hold on.  Will you shut up?  I don't want to trash your business because you've done right by all of us.  And maybe it was one of those things is what I was going to preface this by saying  so we don't completely destroy your business. 
[02:04:30]  Jim Norton plays town hall, and he's feeling all good about himself and says,  Hey, Mom.  Hey, Dad.  Hey, sis.  I'm going to get you a limo from Jersey to town hall, and I'm going to treat you like  superstars because it's a big night for me.  Yeah.  And the night ended with me and Jim Norton wondering where the F is the limo for close  to an hour.  My son's sleeping, and he's calling me.  He goes, My parents are sitting on the corner.  Dude, if you would have showed up, he would have killed you, by the way.  Dude, come on.  Wait a minute.  That's no.  Jim, you weren't.  No, I was happy.  You never went your parents home on time. 
[02:05:00]  Jim, come on.  It's better to have them standing in Manhattan at 2.30 in the morning.  Oh, you know what?  This is not a bit.  I know it's not a bit.  He was pissed.  Were you pissed?  You know what?  And I was trying to calm down.  I'm like, well, maybe it's on the next block.  They got the address wrong.  Maybe there's another town hall.  Maybe they thought it was Urintown, which happened to be playing a block down the road.  It's not even about trashing.  The company is fine because once the driver got here, it was me because most people will  call up and get it through proper channels.  I didn't go through proper channels. 
[02:05:30]  I had to go through a retired bull man.  No offense, but what could go wrong after the limo arrives?  You get in and they drive you.  Absolutely.  The key is getting there on time.  Yeah.  And I am there 99% of the time on time.  The only time was when Ant...  I see your lying scumbag.  Once with Ant, once with Nor...  Where's Pharrell?  Pharrell, please call in right now.  Oh my God, he name drops with everybody.  What happened with Ant?  Everybody.  I was late with Ant about...  Do you remember?  In the city, about 35 minutes.  This is about two and a half years ago. 
[02:06:00]  I think I don't remember that one.  Yeah.  I stood there for hours.  You never used me again.  For hours, I stood there.  No, it was 35 minutes.  And at least you can be subtle because we were talking and he was going to charge me  X amount, which was cool.  But I was telling the opener, he's like, what's he charging you for?  I'm like, no, that's cool.  Because he goes, look, I would give it to him for nothing, but you can't give me plugs  like they can.  Yes, you did say that.  Oh my God.  Jimmy, they don't give me...  You did say that.  Oh, you give me plugs?  Oh, don't worry.  After this segment, I'll let you give your phone number out.  No problem.  Thanks.  Hey, and as far as... 
[02:06:30]  I was pissed at that because I'm like, what the F?  Jim is a part of the show and you're making a pay to limo his parents to town hall to  see him on his break night.  Dude, the only I charged him was $50.  Hey, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ant, speaking of comp, last time I used a limo with you, it was a while ago.  Who paid?  It was your mother.  Into for that wedding.  Well, I gave her the money, but I didn't get a freebie from you.  Yeah, you did.  No, I didn't.  The last time I got a limo from you, I paid.  I got a bill and I paid. 
[02:07:00]  It was on my Amex.  Absolutely.  And then I leave your drive as a nice tip, too.  So it wasn't like...  I'm just saying.  I'm not complaining because I said I'll pay.  I don't care.  I just want to call.  You know what?  If that happened, I would refund you right now because anything that has to...  Wait.  His hands out.  Wait.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Wait a minute.  Anything that has to do with Ant...  And his hands out.  And you or Rick has always been from the start that I'll take care of it.  And if you guys are trash...  I have no problem paying.  You did?  Yeah.  I just want to make sure the car's there and everything's going to be fine. 
[02:07:30]  I don't want a freebie.  No, but wait a minute.  It has nothing to do with that.  You guys...  I started with you.  You're a liar.  You know something that you're not telling us, you slimy scumbag liar.  I'm off the show.  What?  Nothing.  He said I'm off the show.  Because that's not true.  I've never since day one him...  Confess!  Liar!  Confess!  And I only had my parents going from New York to Jersey.  Not both ways. 
[02:08:00]  They took the train in.  Oh, see?  There you go.  One way back.  Nothing.  Because they didn't want to be, you know, an inconvenience.  Because that's how Jimmy is.  Yeah.  And you took advantage of that and said, dude, give me a hundred.  I'll freaking drive your parents around.  I just didn't want mom and dad assaulted by coloreds.  What's wrong with you?  We all love the coloreds these days.  Of course.  It's the towel heads we hate.  Right.  With a passion.  That really did unite black people and white people. 
[02:08:30]  It sure has united all of us.  We're all together now.  I ride the subways now.  No problem.  What?  I've never seen so many people pro-Indian all of a sudden, too.  Support Indians.  It's great.  Anyway, are we done?  No, you know, because that's not true.  That's not true.  Since day one, I've been with you guys.  I would never charge him.  Liar!  Tell us what you know, you goddamn liar!  I would never charge you.  I would never charge Rick, because that's who I started with when I walked in here two years  ago.  No, no. 
[02:09:00]  You're telling me I charge you.  I didn't give you a slip.  That's not true.  You, him.  No.  Look.  You, I charge, because I really...  Jim, I didn't know you.  I was charged.  I didn't get charged.  You know what?  If you were, I want the receipt, because I will refund you.  Oh, boy.  That was two and a half years ago.  Who keep a deed?  No, no.  No, it was about, it was about probably a year ago.  Well, if you were, I apologize.  No, I didn't get charged.  We tipped the driver.  Yes, exactly.  I'm not complaining.  That's the deal.  I wouldn't have minded.  I'll tell you right now, that's how it always has been with you.  No.  No, I wouldn't have minded getting charged.  I leave the driver's great tips, but I got charged, too. 
[02:09:30]  I believe it might have been the limo with my family to go see Aerosmith out in Jones  Beach.  I believe I was, yes, I was charged for that one.  And being charged wouldn't have been a big deal.  You just sit there, and you don't even like sitting there and saying anything, because  I would never.  Because you're a dick.  Because you just sit there, and they'll say a goddamn f***ing word.  Uh-oh.  Okay?  Because the bottom line is, watch out with the language.  Watch out with the language.  What are you talking about?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  We're out of dump.  Don't curse anymore.  Relax. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  Since day one, since I started, I take care of him.  I take care of him.  And you.  That's been the rule.  That has never been the problem.  That has never been the problem.  So then, if you have had that, see, I don't care, I'm charged.  Goddamn annoying.  Don't get, don't get making a rage.  It's not a radio bit now.  It's not a radio bit.  No.  You're wrong.  You're annoying.  You know what?  And you're a dick.  Okay.  All right?  And you sabotaged me twice.  But that's what the whole thing is.  Wait.  How did he sabotage me?  He did not sabotage me with Frenchie.  Did he not sabotage me with Frenchie? 
[02:10:30]  Sabotage?  French words and everything.  Frenchie?  I did not.  Dude.  He sabotaged me.  No, I didn't.  Frenchie called in on his own.  Now, forget about Frenchie.  We called in.  Hold on.  What?  No.  No, no, no.  No, no.  When Frenchie was in studio.  I don't want to hear about that.  The whole, your whole audience hates me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I care about what I did.  I've never said that.  Whatever.  No, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'm going to stick with the facts here.  You did say something.  I've never been charged.  You're right.  You're 100% right. 
[02:11:00]  So relax on that.  And him.  I've been charged.  And you even told me that day.  I'll refund you right now.  You even told me that day, dude, I'm going to have to charge you.  Yeah.  And I was charged.  Which is fine, right?  Which is fine.  I don't care about the freebie.  I don't really know about that.  But don't make it sound like I'm always, you know, that we're always trying to get the freebie.  Dude, the audience, I don't care about you, goddamn audience.  It has nothing to do with that.  It has to do with your family.  I started with you guys.  Whatever you want.  Whatever you want.  Okay?  That's the bottom line.  I didn't know him.  I charged him just a tip.  You know me for two years, stupid. 
[02:11:30]  What are you talking about?  Dude, dude.  You didn't know him.  Hold on.  Now I've got to call you out.  You didn't know Jim Norwood was playing Town Hall?  No.  Jim, I've been...  He's been on the show for four years.  I didn't care about the charge.  It was quite a lot.  Like Memento.  He's got a tattoo stuff on him.  No, I wasn't complaining.  It was just the way he said it.  Hold on.  I would give it to them because they plug.  Don't be so obvious.  I know that.  This is too good for the radio.  You didn't know who he was?  No.  I met him through here.  I never knew who he was.  No.  I didn't know who he was before that.  Oh, my God.  So when he ordered a car, you kind of didn't know?  No.  He had been here a few times. 
[02:12:00]  I've met him a couple times.  A few times?  In April?  I've known you for almost two years.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Your head really is shaped like Peter Boyle's.  I wasn't in there that much.  I haven't been in there the last year and a half.  No, serious.  I haven't been in here the last year and a half for a lot of times.  Jim has been doing the show with us.  I know he has.  For about two years now.  But I wasn't here a lot of times.  I really wasn't.  So you're like, who's this Jim Norton and why does he need a limo to the town hall?  Yeah, exactly.  He goes, no, I know who he was, but Norton really...  Did I ask you for free?  I didn't ask for free.  No, Jim, you didn't.  Dude, you did not ask me for anything.  Hey, listen, listen. 
[02:12:30]  Even people that don't listen to this show, listen to other radio shows, knew that Jim Norton was  playing town hall April 18th.  I still have the date on my stupid head.  And you didn't really know who he was?  No, I knew who he was.  Stop it.  I really never met him.  I had never done business with him.  He caught me going to the phone.  He turned to me.  He said, Ant, I need a limo for my parents.  I said, Jim, I'll take care of you.  I'll do whatever I got to do.  Just tip the driver.  Right?  Of course.  Ant, if you've ever been charged, get the receipt.  I'll refund you.  I don't care. 
[02:13:00]  But the bottom line is, to get back to it, you sabotaged him.  I did not sabotage you.  I did not.  You did sabotage you.  You know what his problem is?  You know what his problem is?  Hold on.  Shut up a second.  I'm not shutting up.  Shut up a second.  How did he sabotage you?  It was the Frenchie incident.  When Frenchie was in here, and we had him out there so he could run in.  I think you did write that line for Frenchie, though.  What line?  About his kid.  No, I never said it.  No, because I was standing next to this idiot.  Get Frenchie on the phone.  I was standing next to this idiot the entire time to make sure he knew when to hang up  the phone.  Shut up. 
[02:13:30]  No, you shut up.  No, you shut up.  No, you shut up.  You f***ing sabotaged me.  I did not.  Watch the language.  Wow, we're running out of dumps.  I did not.  Sabotage me.  You sabotage me.  You are wrong.  You are lying.  You told me the bottom line is, you are lying.  Dude, you're lying.  Dude, you told me, do not.  Dude, you told me anything, I don't care, whatever, whatever said, do not hit him.  I said, whatever you do, don't punch him in the face.  Correct.  Fine.  That's all I said.  And then you called me a pussy because I didn't because he said something about my  son.  But, hold on.  That was the last thing he said about your son, which we never heard. 
[02:14:00]  Will you let me talk and I'll tell you the guy's honest truth.  Frenchie came in here and he did his thing on you and he abused your son.  You did not hit him.  And I called you a pussy.  But you know what?  Hell yeah.  I would have taken him out.  You know what?  You're right.  Because he told me not to.  So why do you want to get...  Hold on.  I got a big business, got a house, got a mortgage.  Hold on, hold on.  Slow down.  I remember Rick kind of told you not to hit him, okay?  Right.  And I was out there...  Hold on!  I'll get through this. 
[02:14:30]  Jesus.  So why are you listening to him?  Because you never talk to me and neither does he.  So if I got to listen to...  So I got to listen to him.  Oh my God.  Listen to this guy with the attention.  Dude, someone...  Come on, Anthony, stop.  No, no, no.  Oh my God.  Someone trashes your son.  You're right.  He said one cut.  Hold on.  Six feet from your face and you're not touching him?  I was ready to kill him.  At least bitch slapped him.  And you're blaming it on Ant and I because we don't talk to you?  No.  I just...  He told me...  You need this radio show that bad?  No, I don't need this radio show. 
[02:15:00]  I'm just saying that he...  That you wouldn't defend your son's honor?  Seriously.  Oh, he told me not to because...  Dude, I was standing next to you out there when he said the line about your son.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  I'm standing next to you at the phone.  To be honest with you, I was running...  I said just don't put the face.  Bottom line, screw the radio show.  The Frenchie, that wimp is six feet in front of you, says something about your son and you're  not hitting him?  Oh, I could have killed him.  That's your problem.  I'm 5'9", 225 pounds.  He's 5'8", 130 pounds.  But don't you understand that's your problem and no one else is in there? 
[02:15:30]  No, I know that.  But you decided for whatever reason that...  You made the comment in the studio.  He goes, you should have hit him.  I said he told me not to.  And I told you five times before I didn't hear the comment about your son.  And Hope, to be honest with you, I was running into the studio, so I heard...  You were a pussy that day.  Don't make me want to be that way.  Whatever.  All right, fine.  Dude, hold on.  You were.  You decided that it was probably going to affect your status on this radio show if you  hit Frenchie.  No, it had to do with actually my company and my life. 
[02:16:00]  You didn't even scare the guy.  You could have taken him down.  You're not going to get sued for taking the guy down and scaring the crap out of him.  I don't know.  If I push him off the chair and he hits his back and bangs his head against the wall or  whatever.  All right.  I ain't going to hit him, but I'll shake the crap out of it.  You should have shook him up.  Not in here.  Not in here.  I should have done it out there.  That's just my opinion.  You handle it your way, I guess.  That's all.  But this is your lifestyle.  This is where you make your living.  So, you know what I mean?  If I was to do it in here, you'd never know.  He'd have it on tape.  This is what might happen.  He beat up Frenchie in here. 
[02:16:30]  Bad, too.  Thank God.  I'm glad.  And you don't think I heard about it from the company and everything?  Yeah.  Here's what Frenchie said about you after you left.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Watt, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  Wow.  His accent wasn't a strong amount of clip.  Is it true that someone asked you for an autograph and you charged him?  We got Mike on the line.  I had to wait for a half hour.  Because he wanted to make sure that Anthony and Opie loved him. 
[02:17:00]  That's not very nice.  And he made a Russian guy sign his name.  Vladimir.  All right.  Go get your present for us so we can all be happy.  Yeah.  We need some happiness on the show.  What do you want?  What do you want?  No, seriously.  Will you, please?  Think it up.  Think of something yourself.  All right.  Fine.  Starbucks Ice Mountain.  But with you, if you have the receipt, give it to me.  I'll refund you.  It's not going to do that.  Give you a receipt.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know that's always been that way and that's always been the policy.  And that's it.  You don't use it that often.  Maybe once or twice a year, but that's how I do it. 
[02:17:30]  The policy, is that the same policy that you used to bad mouth my sister?  I made a mistake that day.  You know.  Come on, Ant.  That's a bad policy.  I apologize.  Get your sister on the phone and her husband.  I apologize numerous times.  Wait, what happened there?  There was a party going on.  Come on, don't even start.  Hold on.  There was a party going on.  Always goes back to that.  No, no.  My sister was there and so was Limo Anthony.  You know, I guess there was some.  We were at Hudson, whatever it is.  I don't know that.  I don't need to know where, the who's, the how's, or what's. 
[02:18:00]  I need to hear this now.  But yeah, so some of the people there knew that Dawn was my sister and knew that Anthony  was Limo Anthony and walked up to Dawn and said, hey, you know, that guy is Limo Anthony  from the Opie and Anthony show.  And Dawn goes, oh, I'll go over and say hi.  He walks up, she walks up to Anthony and goes, hi, I'm Anthony's sister, Dawn.  Let him tell you.  How are you?  And Anthony says, go F. 
[02:18:30]  He goes, yeah, those guys can go F themselves.  Big crap like I give an S.  Those mother Fers can go F themselves and walked away from my sister.  My sister's just standing there like, what a dick.  Wow.  And I was wrong.  Dude, come on.  My sister's just coming up to be nice.  She was right.  She was.  And she was being caught.  I was wrong.  You always have a problem with us because we don't show you enough attention.  I know.  I don't have time in my stupid life when you're so intentional.  That's not true.  And no matter what he says in here, when he's out in public, it's nothing, but we get stories 
[02:19:00]  back about how you bash us all the time.  Well, that's all we hear.  Man, those are big pants.  That's all we hear.  Cowbell Bill, you there?  Call him.  You know what I mean?  Another name.  No, just guys that are associated with your show.  So far, you're making Mike.  I've heard Cowbell Bill.  Because I see these guys.  I would never do that stuff.  Like everyone, he's got to drop all the names of the people on the show.  Hold on.  Someone wants to say hi to, uh.  All right.  Anthony.  French.  You need that God-effing show in your life every day. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, not even today.  Frenchy, not even today.  Why don't you have a God-effing life, man?  Where are you right now?  I know you live in Brooklyn, Frenchy.  I will smack the s*** out of you.  Hey, watch your language.  Frenchy, Frenchy, I will smack the crap out of you.  This is not a bit, dude.  This is not a bit, dude.  Frenchy, this is not a bit.  I will smack the crap out of you.  Jesus Christ, man.  I will take my son, me, and we will smack the crap out of you.  You need your attention, too, babe.  And I will grab your French Napoleon, and I will kill you.  You fight, you bastard.  Frenchy, it's not going to happen.  Yeah?  Why don't you take that bottle of champagne and stick it in your A, you f*** F. 
[02:20:00]  Let's go.  The whole, the whole.  It will taste a little bit better, you dumbass.  Let's do it, Frenchy.  Yeah?  Me and you.  You p***y face.  Let's go, p***y.  Let's go, p***y.  Uh-huh.  You should wear a toupee to look a little bit better, you stupid f***.  Frenchy, I'm not a, you know what I mean?  All you say is stupid.  You bald bastard.  You are the bald bastard.  I hate you.  You suck.  That's right.  You're a bald bastard.  I'm sure you have a carpet growing on your back.  Let's go, Frenchy.  Me and you.  Canole Italiano. 
[02:20:30]  Make another Napoleon, bro.  They study mink, yeah?  Here we go.  I'm sure I like that.  That was good.  You need the attention so bad, huh?  You laugh like a pussy.  Goodbye.  I'm done.  Yeah?  I'm done.  You fat bastard.  Canole face.  Yeah, that's what you are.  Meatball.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  I want to burn you out.  All right, bye.  No doubt about it, Frenchy stays for a while longer.  Yeah.  He's not even going to be on the list of people that might be on the list of people. 
[02:21:00]  He might be on the bubble.  Andrew.  Yeah, what up?  What's up, Andrew?  I got to say, I love it every time Limo Ant comes in.  It's great.  Oh, stop.  I love hearing him fight him backpedal.  I love the, just the total cringe radio.  I love it.  He's one of these guys that says stuff.  He says stuff.  He says stuff.  And he completely contradicts what he said minutes ago.  You are the worst liar, Anthony, because you cannot, you can't cover your tracks.  Dude, that's not true.  You lie on so many different levels and so many different loose ends left out that you 
[02:21:30]  can't tie them up.  Don't even go there.  That's not true.  Where?  Where?  Name one.  Name one.  That's what I like.  All right, I'm out.  It's everything.  Dude, I bad mouth to you?  Because I know when you're out and about, it's like, oh, F those guys.  And you know, you said it to my own sister.  You did say it to her.  Like, you're not going to say it to some guy on the street.  You said it to my own sister.  Listen, how stupid is that?  I said these guys don't want to be associated with me.  That's the deal.  And I wasn't, Rick called me in there. 
[02:22:00]  You said those guys can go up themselves and you used the word and everything, my young  sister in the car.  Dude, from the beginning, all you did was, if I wanted to come in and do what I had  to do was 1-800-UF-N-TOOL.  That was from the start.  You guys used to bust my balls.  I never got any f***ing promos.  Hey, hey.  Hey, what's with the dirty language?  Watch the language.  We're broadcast.  That's how you feel.  We've never met before, but there's still no reason to hurt.  You're out of your mind.  You got business because of us.  I'm Jim Norton.  Actually, no.  You're insane.  I got some. 
[02:22:30]  I got some.  You got business from us.  No, I did not.  No, not as much as you think.  Who cares?  It was all for free.  That is true.  I mean, Ope raises a good point.  I mean, I know we've never met before, but Ope does raise a good point.  We've never paid you just kisses the ass.  You've never paid for a commercial on our show?  Yes, I have.  On our show?  Not on your show, no.  Not on your show.  But that's how you feel, Ant.  Oh, you know what?  That's how you feel.  I don't badmouth you every time I'm out.  All I can base it on is what my sister calls me.  And you know what?  I apologize to your sister and her husband.  If you are badmouthing us to my own sister. 
[02:23:00]  I apologize to your sister and her husband.  We hear other things.  Dude, you know what?  Get your sister and her husband.  Get rock and roll.  Johnny Race now, another name that he has.  Well, come on.  Rock and roll, Johnny Race.  You know what?  F*** you.  Hey.  Oh, come on.  Hey.  That's all right.  Dude, you can't.  Oh, now he's leaving.  He's leaving.  There he goes.  Slamming the door, cursing on his way out.  Oh, my God.  I am so sick of these people that need our attention for whatever reason. 
[02:23:30]  Now, if we were to take a machete and lay it into the middle of his head, would people  call up and say, that was too harsh?  That was cruel?  See?  See what we're dealing with.  Too bad he wasn't wearing his toupee.  I would have ripped it right off his head.  Does he have a toupee?  No.  No.  He's one of those guys that looks good bald.  He doesn't.  I'll give him that.  Sure he does.  It's all right.  Barry, what's up?  Hey, LNA.  Hey, real fast.  What's happening, guys?  We got to break and do something here. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, I love the show.  You guys are the best.  Hey, man.  Opie, don't feel bad about Stalker Patty.  You did what you had to do.  You did the man.  You know?  You know what?  In fact, after you yanked the thing that wig off her head, you should have had her pushed  in the gutter and finished it.  I don't think I've ever said I felt bad about it.  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  All right.  Don't feel bad about it.  I know it went too far and it was awful.  No, you didn't.  You took it right where it needed to go.  And all of these people that are writing and calling and saying you're a bad guy, F them.  All right. 
[02:24:30]  As far as Limo Ant, why don't you rent one of his limos and then run his stupid sea-sucking  ass over with it?  You know something?  All right.  You guys got to stop with the language.  Yeah, we...  That wasn't a curse, though, can I say?  It wasn't?  It's a sea-sucking...  Oh, okay.  I thought he said the F word.  No.  I'm so used to hearing it from Limo Ant now.  Before the break, can we get him back in here and make sure he's okay?  He doesn't want to come back in.  He ran down the hall.  Just get back in here.  He's so sensitive.  We'll cuddle him a little bit.  He'll be okay.  We'll pat him on his bald head a little bit. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  And tell him everything's going to be okie-dokie.  He needs the attention.  It's ridiculous.  It's pathetic.  Let's make sure everything is hunky-dory.  Hunky-dory.  You got to make sure things are copacetic.  Right.  You know, keep it all in the straight and narrow.  Exactly.  Above board.  Where is he?  He's not coming in.  He is too much.  What's the hullabaloo?  There is a bit of a...  And Rick has his arm on his shoulder like it's going on out there.  It's okay.  It's the big to-do. 
[02:25:30]  Get it.  Come on.  No more malarkey.  Come on now.  All right.  We've had enough hatred on our show this week.  Come on with you.  Are you all right?  You know what?  I came in to defend...  Are you all right?  No.  I came in to defend you, and he ransacked me like he always does.  And the bottom line...  Yeah, because I like...  Because we all know Ant's the bad guy.  Ransacked you.  Ransacked.  Did he rape and pillage too?  What does that mean?  He ransacked you.  Well, Ant always does that, right?  What?  Ant does that, right?  Yeah.  It's either you or him.  Either way, with me.  Ransacked.  Ransacked. 
[02:26:00]  We just want to make sure you're okay.  Blindside.  How's that?  Blindside me.  Blitzkrieg.  Yeah, blind...  Blindside me.  Yeah, he's blindsiding you because all the stuff he just did is all just...  No, he's right about...  Dude, to call me a lie, I did once, and I was wrong, and I apologized to your family.  Why did you do the...  You know, Harvey makes a good point.  But I did apologize to you, too.  And I know we want to move on, but Harvey wants to make a good point for me.  All right.  Harvey?  Harvey?  Harvey.  Hey, why do you need a receipt to refund him, huh?  Come on now. 
[02:26:30]  Don't you own the company?  Yeah, but I don't know.  You own the company.  Why do you need a receipt?  Like, I'm going to try to screw you over for a couple of bills?  Never.  You're a millionaire.  Come on, man.  Hook him up.  Give him his money back.  You're right.  You say you never charge him.  Yeah, what do you need?  Come on, Harvey.  Come on, Harvey.  Throw the dice.  What?  What?  What is that from?  Oh, my God.  It's not from anything.  It's just throw the dice.  Front of the wine, the craps table.  Throw the dice.  I'm trying to do a little...  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  No.  Just sitting at the craps table. 
[02:27:00]  Look at how uncomfortable he is.  Yeah.  You guys are like douchebags.  We're not douchebags.  And we're doing a little Honeymooners thing.  Some brilliant Honeymooners stuff.  I don't jump in and then try to trumple him.  You just let him do his thing.  Sorry.  What does throw the dice mean?  Come on out of there, Hav.  Come on.  Give us another one.  One more.  Spin the roulette wheel.  Give us one more.  Come on, Hav.  Trade in your chips.  I don't know.  One more.  Mr. Faber-Shav.  I don't know.  What else? 
[02:27:30]  What else?  He said he gave me one more.  I don't know.  Come on, Harvey.  I'm at the back of our table.  Double down.  Because I've got gambling to fall back on, Hav.  I'm splitting the aces.  I'm splitting the aces, Naughton.  Come on.  Give us one more.  No.  No.  You are a metal case.  I am.  Gee, I never knew Davey Clark had doubled down.  Dude.  Is there a possibility to call into truce with you more so than anything else? 
[02:28:00]  What?  Call into truce with you.  What is truce?  Shut up.  He doesn't care.  None of us care.  All right.  Cool.  Truce.  Just be a dude, man.  You got it.  Just hang.  You got it.  Be a guy.  Fine.  Thank you.  My God.  Whew.  Jesus.  Jiminy Cricket.  He is so high maintenance.  Yeah.  You really are.  I know I am.  Okay.  I won't be.  Ben.  Whoa.  God damn Ben. 
[02:28:30]  Everybody get into the act.  Ben's cursing in the background.  What's wrong, Ben?  Ben.  Did I make them forget about Patty, right?  Ben, you said you're like a woman.  But you know what?  Dude, don't tell me.  Dude, you know what?  I came up to you and told you the whole incident, and I explained it to you about...  Never mind.  You know something.  What are you talking about?  I've never asked you for anything.  No.  You know something, Anthony?  I use a different company.  No.  You best think long and hard what you want to do in front of our audience to get the chance  to stay on this program, because it's going to be the audience's vote. 
[02:29:00]  I'm done.  Well, you know something?  I'm done.  Ladies, I'm done.  This is the first realistic, sensible thing I've heard come out of your mouth.  You're done.  I'm done.  Truce.  Truce.  Let's be friends.  Truce.  Did you eat those carrots?  Can you give us more of that voice you do?  No.  Roll the dice.  What the hell was that?  My friend, you know?  I'm surprised you didn't say his name.  Drop a few more.  He doesn't have any.  We blow it at the tangiers, Norton. 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  You got out of the hole.  You know what?  You've just, you're a dick.  You're just a dick.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  You're just, you know, because you don't know, you know I don't know the nuances of  what comes in.  Because you come in here and make yourself look like an ass?  No, you know what?  That had nothing to do with it.  You asked me to come up here.  Right.  Today, just now.  No, no, no.  I didn't ask you to come up here.  You called in, idiot.  He brainstormed you.  All of a sudden, I go down to the office and I see you standing near my desk, hanging out 
[02:30:00]  talking to Rossi.  And Rossi wasn't even talking to you because he had his back turned to you.  Ooh.  That's not true.  That is true.  That's not true.  Ooh.  It is true?  No, it's not true.  So why are you here?  How many more times back and forth?  No.  Why are you in the building?  I don't know.  Here's a good question.  Why are you in the building?  Because there's a problem with Rory during the Ron and Fez show and I'm trying to figure it  out.  Ah, Ron and Fez.  And another problem.  And another problem.  Why is there a problem there?  Yeah, what's the problem now?  What is the problem?  You are a high maintenance woman. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  You know something?  Boob Inspector, Mapleshade, New Jersey, says it all.  Limo Ant equals George Costanza.  Oh my God.  That hits it right.  If you've been having a little trouble feeling out what he's all about from this past conversation,  George Costanza.  You're just like him.  Okay.  No comment.  His nervous little titter. 
[02:31:00]  And obviously you don't have a girlfriend these days.  He's a turtle.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, this girlfriend will let you be on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Oh.  Roll the dice.  Touchdown.  Extra point.  Two point conversion.  Good job.  Thank you.  That was a good job.  What does he say?  I don't know what this stuff means.  What's with the football analogies?  Yeah.  We were doing the gambling analogies for a while.  Gonna blitz, Naughton. 
[02:31:30]  You are a safety.  Can you take the headphones off and walk out uncomfortably?  Sure.  I love that part of this.  Grandma's delicious mystery quarterback.  Wait.  Dude, dude, dude.  Got him.  He turns around.  He's shaking his head.  Where's he going?  He's walking down the hall and he's giving the finger.  There you go.  As he walks.  The backward finger.  God.  Damn.  Oh, it's so annoying.  I can't believe it.  He's yelling at Rick. 
[02:32:00]  He's blurting stuff out that we don't know what it means.  What did he say about the guy?  What did he say again?  Roll the dice.  Roll the dice.  Yeah.  Hey, Harvey.  Roll the dice.  What?  He's got to stick around, man.  I have to vote now.  That guy has to stick around.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you better be.  You're going to be.  He's got to stick around.  Wow. 
[02:32:30]  What do you want?  You're listening.  This is Opie and Anthony.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Or do you want your listening to?  This is Anthony.  Oh, this is.  I said my name.  I see.  Sorry.  Beg your pardon.  Hi.  Okay.  This is Brian Cox.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Irene. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me is that I want to know something.  Hi, Irene.  How come you're politically incorrect with some people, which is okay, but some other  people, you're scared and you step on people, you act like you're on eggshells.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Please explain.  Why is that?  Please explain.  Well, for instance, certain ethnic groups, you don't give a damn how you degrade them.  Be blunt.  Be blunt.  But the other ones.  And say what you mean.  What ethnic groups?  Okay. 
[02:33:30]  Be very plain and clear here.  The black people, you seem to get very frightened of offending them.  They kill people.  I'm not afraid of offending black people.  What are you talking about?  Yes, you are.  You're absolutely not.  No?  We aren't afraid of it.  Okay.  And why are you specializing in some soft porn crap?  I mean, what are you doing?  You're catering to the jerks of this country and that's how you make your salary?  What are you talking about?  What is wrong with you?  What are you talking about?  People don't act like you.  Go out on the street.  Why don't you get to the point of what you're saying? 
[02:34:00]  People sell drugs on the street.  I'm saying, how come you're specializing in this soft porn crap?  What soft porn?  How fat are you, Cher concert goer?  How fat are you?  Well, not fat I am.  That you don't like making women.  Yes.  A 125 pound.  Really?  Then you must have an ugly mug.  Long red hair.  Oh, good.  Irene.  It's not hot red either.  Beautiful, big, green eyes.  Irene.  If I ask this, who the hell cares?  Let me ask Irene.  What I'm saying is that you specialize in soft porn.  You specialize in the low elements of people.  Irene, can I ask you something?  And you love it.  Irene.  You're 35 to 40 years old.  God, I've got to ask Irene something, but you won't listen. 
[02:34:30]  Irene.  Irene, how did you get to know this show?  I listen to it sometimes.  Why?  Because sometimes.  Why?  You know why?  Why?  Sometimes you're funny.  All right.  Then you lose it.  You lose it.  You don't appreciate the girls that come in and what you call the soft porn.  Well, that's part of us and part of our show.  And there are two women who are mentally deranged, who obviously don't have any self-esteem.  Three now.  And you just degrade them to hell. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, we rip them apart.  What the hell is wrong with them?  You are a sad, sad woman.  We rip them apart.  You are the saddest woman.  I'm not a sad woman.  I'm a smart one.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  You're obsessed with this show, and it pisses you off, and you love being pissed, so you  keep coming back.  And I think that sometimes you're funny.  I love to laugh.  And I think that sometimes you're intelligent, but you really go out of your way to degrade  people.  Who's your thing?  And you don't.  All right.  You don't.  What nationality are you? 
[02:35:30]  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality am I?  I don't think it's important.  Why not?  You're talking about nationalities, you stupid, dishonest coward.  Speak the truth.  Call us the truth.  What nationality are you?  Shut your lying face, dummy.  What are you, a racist?  I'm very nervous that you don't offend certain groups.  You're absolutely wrong.  If you're going to be politically incorrect, be politically incorrect with everybody.  What?  Are you nuts?  You are an insane, you're a dishonest, you're probably a real racist, and we're joking.  What ethnic group are you a member of, stupid? 
[02:36:00]  F*** you, you stupid.  Oh, that's right, you white trash whore.  You want me to write?  That's right, whatever you are, use your dirty language, you filthy-mouthed, poorly-raised  hooker.  I used to work there.  Fifth Avenue sucking you-know-what for money.  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me anything.  I'm 50 years old.  Exactly, you aging meatbag with one breast.  You act like 12.  50 years old.  And I don't know, you know what?  We like acting 12.  And we like young women. 
[02:36:30]  Did she say she used to-  Young women with firm, firm breasts.  Did she say she used to work here?  Because the teenagers are a bunch of suck-ass jerks.  That's right.  And you know.  You filthy-mouthed senior citizen.  Thank him for that.  That's a nice language for a grandmother, you old bag of meat.  Nice language for an old lady.  Irene, you used to work here?  She hung up.  She hung up.  Typical of a hole like that.  Hang up.  I don't think she was white.  She didn't sound white.  Whatever she was, why don't you offend black people?  What are you talking- 
[02:37:00]  Shut up, stupid.  I hate old, deluded people.  You 50-year-old, one-breasted bag of meat.  Just hang it up and be grateful that some of your friends are still living.  If that exchange isn't worthy of a Jim Norton promo, I don't know what is.  I saw Steve going, yeah.  I hate people that don't tell the truth.  Be honest about where you're coming from.  I thought she was a deering.  Dude, she was an old pig.  I don't like Jim Norton.  I don't think he's funny.  I don't like Opie and Anthony.  She's like, all right, you accept that because it's an honest point of view.  But when you're coming from like this, I hate the fact that my youth is gone, and I listen 
[02:37:30]  sometimes, like Anthony pointed out, I like to be mad.  Just be honest that you like to be angry, so that's why you listen.  I hate liars.  She enjoys listening to get angry.  Dude, people don't think the show is funny.  I accept that.  That's a taste, judgment, call, fine.  But just stop being so-  And then she's like, are you effing?  Exactly.  Show your true colors.  You uneducated, ancient pig.  But guys-  You cryptic, filthy-mouthed old grandmother with no love left in your one-breasted life.  I'm 125 pounds. 
[02:38:00]  And she doesn't have hot red hair.  It's probably orange with green eyes.  Boy, that's really sexy.  You glow-in-the-dark bag of pig meat.  Bright green eyes and red hair.  Do you have any primary colors?  That bozo hair.  That bozo color.  Big red, awful orange hair.  That's really sexy.  I want to put my mule into a sun-kissed with two little emeralds staring out of it.  Big, beautiful green eyes.  Men never care about your eyes. 
[02:38:30]  We don't care, ladies.  We just don't care about your eyes.  I like them.  I love them.  I don't care about them.  See, because you don't look at the person as a human, man.  No, I like a human.  You look at them as an object.  I think, I swear to you, the eyes are the best feature on a woman.  No one likes eyes just sealing them shut with his seed.  Yeah, they're not the best thing on a woman.  You're sick if you don't look at eyes on a woman.  Dude, I look at them when I have to, when I'm apologizing the next morning, but I don't  like to stare at them.  Because usually they're crying.  Maybe that's it. 
[02:39:00]  Do you understand what I mean about that person?  Absolutely.  That makes me so angry.  So just be honest about why you don't like somebody.  Don't try to be clever and pseudo-manipulative.  Just tell the truth.  What you don't like, get to the point.  Okay.  We have a girl outside.  Oh, thank God.  And you're like soft core poor.  Believe me, if we can get away with hardcore, that's what we'd be doing.  I used to work on Fifth Avenue.  Here's your money, daddy.  That's what you did, you ancient pig.  Youth is gone.  Get used to it.  You dirtbag hypocrite. 
[02:39:30]  But we're all going to be old someday.  I'm not knocking that, dude.  I'm 33.  Do I resent people who are 18?  Most of them are dumb, but I mean, no, I don't resent them.  Good for them.  Where are the pictures?  Kids today.  They're not leaving her hand.  If they come in, she comes in.  Tell her to come in with them.  No, no.  We got to take a break.  Deals.  We got a break.  It's the worst.  Opian Anthony.  And we're back with the Opian Anthony show.  Irene's calling back.  Irene.  Yeah.  What's wrong now? 
[02:40:00]  Can't get enough.  No, I just want to tell you that I'm no old hag.  If you passed me on the street, you wouldn't recognize me.  I got a call.  Number one, tell that guy that I'm no old hag.  And what if I was?  So what?  Would that make me less of a person?  Yes.  No, it would not.  It would not.  You see, you're so mainstream.  You're trying to be so cool, but you're mainstream America.  Yeah.  So what the hell are you talking about?  You don't think there's any old, good-looking, sexy people?  You sound like the chick from Midnight Cowboy.  You were going to ask me for money? 
[02:40:30]  I'm so far away from that.  You'd have no idea.  I'm a sexy chick.  Can an old lady yell like this?  She wouldn't have the energy.  It's not the fact that you might be.  Yes, I used to work there.  It's not your age that I care about.  It's your thinking.  It's your mentality.  I don't care how old you are.  No, my mentality is good.  If you let me finish a sentence, you finish, you let me finish.  That was what bothered me.  It wasn't the fact that you might be 50.  I don't care.  I don't have sex with a 50-year-old woman like yourself.  I mean, I'd probably feed you maybe some, pull your diapers off and enjoy you.  I'm not saying that your age doesn't bother me.  All right.  No, I'll tell you what bothers me. 
[02:41:00]  You degrade people at this station.  I don't like the full porn.  You want us to degrade black people.  And I want to know what kind of teenager you have to cater to to get ratings.  Why can't you be intelligent?  Irene.  There's not funny people.  That's wrong.  You let it out.  What the crap?  You want us to degrade black people.  Those two ladies that keep coming to the show.  Irene.  Because they loved it.  That's right.  You're right.  If you want to bring up...  Why do they love it?  Why do you have to feed into it?  If you want to bring up ratings, we do very well in the ratings with people that are a 
[02:41:30]  lot older than their teens, Irene.  That's probably their parents.  Well, whatever.  The point is, is that why can't you be funny and intelligent without being disgusting and  degrading?  So you know what's funny and entertaining to everybody else.  People are stupid.  Young people are stupid.  See?  You arrogant old bitch.  You know what's deep inside.  She is so jealous of youth.  You're jealous.  She's jealous of youth.  Young people.  Young people.  You jealous old, angry elitist. 
[02:42:00]  I am not old.  I used to be a young person just 10 years ago.  When I was younger, I didn't do this.  You are an ass, Irene.  You are an ass.  My...  This comes out of my...  Hey, stop.  You're being disgusting now.  Stop trying to be clever.  What kind of dignified senior citizen are you?  I'm not a senior citizen, you stupid...  Oh, there she goes again.  See?  How easy you are.  With your dirty mouth.  Want me to come to 888 7th Avenue, my old digs?  I used to work there.  What did you do? 
[02:42:30]  You're so easy to make man.  What?  Did you work here at the station?  Doing what, you old bag?  You stupid jerky.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, potty mouth.  Wow, stop the cursing.  Irene, did you work at this station?  No.  I worked in the building.  Oh, what happened?  You got fired?  Mandatory retirement?  No, I quit.  I worked at a public relations firm.  Oh, Jesus.  You must have been great there.  Why'd you quit?  Too many young, happy people?  No, I mean...  This was 20 years ago before the computer came out. 
[02:43:00]  You're ancient.  Damn that computer, that new thing.  That infernal device.  You want to see how ancient I am?  If you saw me, you would have believed it.  Yeah, blame the computer.  Yeah, big deal.  I'd put it in a lot of people.  So what if I'm...  Everyone knows when a secretary hits 40, you've got to get rid of them.  Two, I've seen plenty of gorgeous 60-year-olds.  Look at Loretta Young before she died.  You were going to ask me for money?  Do you see Loretta Young?  Do you know that Ursula Andress is 65 years old?  Exactly, and she's hot.  Would you reject Ursula Andress?  No, I wouldn't.  You are bad.  But she's not an obnoxious, potty-mouthed, jealous old lady. 
[02:43:30]  You are.  I am not a jealous old lady.  You've never even seen me.  Irene, take your teeth out.  All right, Irene.  Gum me.  You don't know who I am.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  Irene.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Irene, Irene, we want you down here in the studio.  Why?  We want to take a look at you.  If I'm wrong, I will admit and apologize.  No, I don't think it would be mentally healthy for me.  Why?  Because I don't like the way you operate. 
[02:44:00]  I don't like the soft points.  Irene, what kind of medication are you on?  Be honest.  You're on antidepressants, right?  I should.  My boyfriend died on my bathroom floor two or three years ago.  You see what I mean?  Do you see what I mean?  It starts to watch it.  You see what I mean?  This is why I won't come down.  Oh, God.  Why are you laughing?  No, no, no, no, really.  Why are you laughing?  Irene, I agree.  Stop that anymore.  I want to know why you're laughing.  Irene, I agree.  Tell me why you're laughing.  Oh, no, no, no.  Tell me what happened. 
[02:44:30]  I'm sorry.  That ain't cool.  Irene, what happened?  I say you're sorry, and that's all you have to say.  I'm sorry.  I didn't do it.  What happened?  What happened?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  As long as you say you're sorry.  What happened?  Hold on, Irene.  Yes.  What happened?  I'm not feeling too good about myself, and I apologize.  Apology taken.  So what happened in the bathroom?  What happened, Irene, in the bathroom?  He died of heart failure.  What?  What are you doing?  He died of what?  Why is that laughter in the background?  He died of what?  No.  I wanted that laughter in the background stop. 
[02:45:00]  He was a great guy.  He was a wonderful liberal.  He was a wonderful, cool guy.  You would love him if you knew him.  Irene, what happened on that bathroom floor?  What did he die of?  Heart failure.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  See what I mean?  You see what I mean?  You see what I mean?  Apologize.  Apologize.  That's why I won't come down.  Apologize.  Irene, look.  Apologize.  Irene, listen.  This is Opie.  I apologize for Anthony. 
[02:45:30]  Anthony is a son of a bitch.  He's had a tough, tough year or two.  I don't care about me.  Apologize about my boyfriend making fun of the people who died.  That's all.  He's not going to hear the apology.  Yes, he is.  I believe in life after death.  Yeah, but he's taking a dirt nap.  Yeah, he's rotting somewhere.  Don't worry about it.  He's not rotting.  There is an afterlife.  He's fully alive and he's listening to you.  He's not.  He is.  Why do you have a vested interest in not believing in the afterlife?  When do you think his jaw dropped?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  He went bye-bye in the box. 
[02:46:00]  I could show you pictures of him that would put you to shame.  How big was he?  He's a gorgeous guy and he's still alive.  He's still alive.  He crossed over.  He's still alive.  Shots and he's still alive.  How long were you dating Virgil Salazzo?  30 years.  30 years.  30 years.  Why didn't he marry you?  Wait, I want to hear the story.  This is very serious, idiots.  Why are you doing this?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right, dude.  All right, all right.  30 years.  Hold on, Irene.  So what happened?  He went into the bathroom to take a, what, a bath? 
[02:46:30]  No, no.  I came home one day and he said, he was in bed and he said, I said, what's wrong?  And it was six o'clock.  He said, oh, I think I have the flu.  Oh.  I said, oh, you know, like I was like, you know, I said, okay.  So I just went about my business, which is, and then, uh.  Are you feeling guilty that you didn't bring him to, uh, the hospital at that point?  I mean, about that dying, I had nothing to do with it.  No, no, about not bringing him to the hospital.  Maybe you should have taken him to the hospital and he said he was sick.  Oh, yeah, there was talk of that and, uh, I thought it was the flu.  There was no clutching of the chest or a pain or anything. 
[02:47:00]  So we thought he had the flu.  So he was even, like, getting up and going to the refrigerator now and then.  Yeah.  He did keep going to the bathroom, so I figured, gee, he must have a virus.  Right.  Two o'clock in the morning, I'm woken up and my, his uncle was living with us.  You know, his uncle didn't, never married.  Right.  I said, what is that noise?  He's a gay guy.  And I said, what noise?  He said, I heard somebody, a commotion in the bathroom.  And then I heard some guy say, help me, help me.  Oh, no. 
[02:47:30]  And I said, well, I went in there and I still thought it was the flu.  And I go in there and I say, what's wrong?  Yeah.  And he says, uh, he couldn't answer me.  And so we moved him, but it was like moving dead meat.  Oh, boy.  And so I called the ambulance and I saw him sit up, look straight ahead of me as if he  was looking at something.  Yeah.  And there was no pain.  There was no screaming.  There was no yelling.  There was no clutching of the chest.  And he said, I'll be all right.  I'm going to be all right.  I said, oh, yeah.  Oh, that's great.  So I turned my back, called the ambulance. 
[02:48:00]  Ambulance came one, two, three.  Didn't let us see anything.  Put us in the police car to drive us to the hospital.  Yeah.  The police car wasn't moving.  And then they came back and said, that's it.  He's finished.  Can I have an apology?  Can I have an apology?  Even though I know it's your kid.  Oh, yeah.  Can I have an apology?  Yeah, we make it okay by just apologizing. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, Irene, I'm really sorry.  I am sorry.  Okay, okay.  But listen to this.  We're obviously going for a cheap laugh.  Yeah.  So, sorry.  Okay.  But the point is, is that I don't like your soft porn.  I don't know why you degrade certain people.  You know what?  You're actually right.  And you know what?  I don't like...  I think I know why you do it.  Irene, Irene, she...  Because nobody would be listening.  Irene, you're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You know what?  And I don't like annoying, lazy girlfriends who tell their boyfriends to go back to bed when they're  having heart pain.  They're not.  See, he wasn't having heart pain. 
[02:49:00]  My God.  See the signs next time.  What?  Yeah, maybe if you weren't thinking about your beauty, see if you were going to rush them  to the hospital.  A self-centered...  There was no heart pain.  There was no pain at all.  You're feeling guilt, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  Why don't you talk to John Edwards?  John Edwards?  I watched him.  He's wonderful.  Maybe he can put you in touch with your boyfriend.  No, no.  I'm not interested in that.  I like Gary Zukav.  So your boyfriend can yell at you for not taking him to the hospital.  Have you ever heard of Gary Zukav?  No.  No, why?  Did he also kill someone he loved by laziness? 
[02:49:30]  What?  Who is he?  Wasn't he the guy that hung around with John Travolta in Greece?  No, no, no.  That was Danny Zuko, right?  Find out who he is.  Oh, I forgot.  The point is...  Maybe your husband...  Maybe your husband faked his own death to get away from you.  Yes.  I wish.  I really wish.  Because that would be better than what's now.  You were going to ask me for money?  I'm a very sexy chick.  Oh, no, ma'am.  Here's $20 for a cab.  What?  I know Sylvia Miles. 
[02:50:00]  You didn't get it.  No, I didn't get it.  Was it your boyfriend or your husband?  Well, it was like a common law.  All right, 30 years and you never put a ring on your finger.  Doesn't that tell you how aggravating you can be?  I told you she was black.  We had a bond where that...  Irene, I know this is going to be a little uncomfortable for you, but what were his last  words to you?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  So you're a Kenny Loggins fan?  What? 
[02:50:30]  What?  I don't understand what you're saying.  He seemed to be looking past me as if he was seeing something.  Probably some softcore porn.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, right.  Probably a hot young chick walking past the ambulance.  No, no, no.  Yeah, right.  That's funny.  He just said, I'm okay.  Yeah.  I feel fine.  I said, oh, that's good.  And I turned around and I'm not psychic at all.  I don't have any premonitions of anything. 
[02:51:00]  You sure don't.  I even heard the low-flying plane at the World Trade Center.  It was right there.  And I thought it was just a low-flying plane.  I wanted to see it.  It was, you idiot.  I thought I'm fascinated with low-flying planes.  We all are.  Fascinated by low-flying planes.  I think we all are, yeah.  You try to catch them with a butterfly net, you horses.  I had no premonitions and no psychic ability at all.  Irene, I have a tape of your boyfriend's last words, actually.  No, no, no.  Could you shut up?  Could you shut up?  No, what was his final words again? 
[02:51:30]  I'm okay.  I'm fine.  I thought it was, I'm all right.  You just messed up my bitch.  What's the difference?  What is the difference?  You should remember the last words.  What was it?  It was, I'm all right, you said.  I just told you.  I'm all right.  Nobody's heard about me.  Why you got to give me a bite?  Look, um...  It's a day.  I'm out already, okay?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  I don't know about a bird like you.  You got to give me a bite. 
[02:52:00]  Why don't you just let me be?  Do what you like.  Yeah, do what you like.  Go back to bed while I'm having a heart attack.  Listen, listen, morons.  Listen, uh, ratings grabber.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, how it's done?  Shut up.  Hey, how it's done?  Uh, uh...  Can't stay. 
[02:52:30]  I'm consterating.  Uh, you're also popping out of a medical alert button, you selfish bag.  I'm falling and I can't get up.  I don't feel.  I'm all right.  Hey, long eyes.  Hey, long eyes.  Just let it be  I'm alright  Don't know about it  But about me  No life  Better than no life  I want to know something 
[02:53:00]  Who are you trying to please?  The teenagers?  You want to make it entertaining?  Everybody with a live spouse  I know  You know what?  You're boring  You are such boys  You just want to be like  You're funny  You think you're so different  Because you're so mainstream  It's not funny  This has been done before  Don't you understand?  We're cakes for nothing  That was the last word  We're cakes for nothing  It sure beats falling on the bathroom floor

Hey everyone  We're all gonna get laid  Old school  Hey, wait a minute  Oh  You want me there?  You want me there?  I'd love to have him  What?

Good, let her hang up  I wanted to know what her skills were  I'm just putting her on hold  So we get more delay  I'll tell you one thing  Her skills are not  She's not good at spotting heart attacks  That's not a skill  I'm an old bag of meat  Who with a potty mouth  Why can't I get hired?

[03:03:00]  She can call back  She's obsessed with the show  She can't stop listening  Yes, she is  She has a bunch of pornographers  With money pouring out of their brains  Out of their ears  You got money pouring out of your ears  You know what  This lady  She likes the show a lot  She does  She's a fan  And you know what  She's just frustrated  When we go down the sex route  Because she needs to get effed  Believe me  If I had her here  I would take her  Into where Stinky hangs out  Club Stinky  If I took my mule out  Pow  She'd be right on it  You think?  Guaranteed  She'd pop her teeth out 
[03:03:30]  You pornographers  You're  I'd hold  I'd put her teeth on a desk  And then chatter  Like those little goof teeth  You buy  Like those gag gift teeth  Get to servicing  Chop chop  Methuselah  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Let's go to Irene  Is this the Irene?  No  Irene  Yeah  What's up?  I want to go to the party  Because I think I'd be 
[03:04:00]  A lot of fun  I'm like about 18  And what's more  I have a crush on your  Little producer  Jim Norton  You know when that girl  Irene called  About a month ago  And he said one  To her  Oh I got so  Ma'am  I was laughing  Because she's going in  For a biopsy  And if I find out  That I have cancer  Which I don't mind  Because I don't want to live  Then I'm going to send  A disease breast  To his  To your cafeteria  And he's going to eat it  No I won't  I'll whack my bag onto it 
[03:04:30]  You dope  And I'm not the producer  I'm the almost fired  Hack comic  They have in studio  Get your information straight  Cancer lady  Oh boy  This is going to be  A weird day  It's only going to get  Stranger  Yeah  She cursed a lot  So I don't know  What made the air  But basically  The last time  Irene called  You want to explain  Irene  Irene's the lady  How do you explain her  She's insane  Picture a sea  With feet  Irene was the  The lady  That was too busy  Sleeping to notice 
[03:05:00]  That her  Her loved one  Her husband  Was dying in the bathroom  Yeah yeah  It was like 2 in the morning  I think she  She laid the whole scene out  And the husband complained  That you know  He wasn't feeling too well  Or anything  And instead of maybe  Irene staying up all night  Making sure her husband's okay  Or whatever  She went to bed  She went to bed  And got a good night's sleep  While her husband  Died in the bathroom  Can you fix my heart  I don't feel good  But I think 
[03:05:30]  That one of those calls  Jimmy did make reference  To the fact that  She might have one boob  Yeah  Oh well  And so she said  She said that  But she used the T word  For boob  And I guess  You hit home  Because she does have two  But she's going in  For a biopsy  There may be a problem  With one of her boobs  And now she's really pissed off  That you said that  A couple weeks ago  Too bad  Be a nicer person  It's not my fault  I don't know you  I don't care about you  I don't care if you have a lump 
[03:06:00]  And she also said  If one is  Well your brain's out  That's what I would do  She also said  If one's cancerous  I'm sorry we have to repeat all this  Because I don't know  What the curse is  Cut out here  That she will be mailing  Or sending  The cancerous boob  To you  Jim Norton  Dude  And she said  I should eat it  Yeah  And I replied to her  That I would whack my bag on it  How great would that be  And then just yell at it  And fall asleep  And have a heart attack  While it sits there  And does nothing  It would be  Do you realize  That if you sent  Your severed breast  It would be just as effective  In helping a loved one 
[03:06:30]  As the rest of you is  Oh man  Sit there callously  I love the fact  I love the fact  How she called up  All nice  And I'm Irene  And then by the end  She was out of her effing mind  Like we weren't supposed  To know it was her  She's a crud  And she does bad impressions  Of an 18 year old  I want to talk to your producer  Jim Norton  No we all knew  It was Irene  So I'm just hoping  Irene calls back  You only gave us  A little bit today  With her lump  We love when  Irene calls this show  She is a lump  I like that  Oh your friend's calling back  Your friend's calling back

Yeah  Like after a while  When that all wears off  When she finally goes  Okay Jared  Just pound it  I'd bring her into the bathroom  And make her lay in the same position he was laying in  And then I'd make her feel really nice  Lay on your side with your head under the toilet  There you go  There you go  I would reenact it 
[03:16:30]  Like the artist did in the Manson house  Our friend from DC  That lunatic  Who I love  Reenact the boyfriend death scene  Yeah that's what I would do  I know what Irene wants  Go back to my website  Take a look  See if you can see the bulge in the front of the jeans  I know what you want Irene  It's alright  Alright  No need to be ashamed  I love that lady  She's great man  I think she  Give me the address for this effing party  This party  She wants to go so bad  She wants to have something to do  You pull those diapers off  It smells like baby powder and little accidents

[03:18:00]  And you'll blow us off  Oh come on  Now see  That's that advanced  That advanced thought  We used to have this relationship  With like the Goo Goo Dolls  And we had it with Rob Zombie  For a while  Yeah for 10 minutes  Stop  If you don't leave me  I won't leave you  That's how it works  It's fair  It's a two way thing  Irene wants to talk  To Jimmy Norton  One more time  The crazy lady  She can't get enough of me  Because Jim said  As Irene was hanging up  That you will have sex  With Irene right  Oh yeah  I know  She wants  Get ready on the dump button  Alright  Irene 
[03:18:30]  She'll curse too  Because she has no control  I just wanted to say  Do not curse  Do not curse  Let's see if you can do this  Like a decent person  Without cursing  Don't sprout obscenities  About me  Or else  The only thing  That will go into your mouth  Is my fist  Okay  Good night  Some people are into that  That's what she called  She's hanging up  She was real smooth there  Oh I wish you would have cursed  Before she hung up  God almighty  Just one  It was almost too clean  Yeah  You do what you do  You put nitroglycerin  On your helmet  And she'll pop it  Right in her mouth  If her heart starts to flutter 
[03:19:00]  You rotten old bag of meat  You got to explain that  Nothing  You got to explain that  You got to explain that  Picture the cryptkeeper  In a diaper with one breast  And a dead spouse  Under a septic tank  And you have the lady  That just called us  You got to explain  She's one of the best stories  That we've ever heard  On the show  This old broad is completely insane  She called us up a while back  And said that her boyfriend  Had died  It wasn't even a husband  It was Irene  Yeah  Her boyfriend died  He was feeling ill  Like he thought he had the flu  He was up all night  Like ill  As she was sleeping 
[03:19:30]  And he decided  He goes  Oh I'm not feeling  Well and goes into the bathroom  And she continued to sleep  And she just keeps sleeping  She didn't think it was a big deal  So she hears like  Oh help me  And finally she goes into the bathroom  After a while  She rolls over a couple times  Tries to go back to sleep  Yeah like  Oh would you shut up  With that  Stop it with the help me  She goes into the bathroom  Finally  There's her boyfriend  He had a heart attack  On the floor  Of the bathroom  So I guess she was able enough 
[03:20:00]  To get the sleepy seeds  Out of her eyes  Enough to call the ambulance  And they put him in the ambulance  And he died in the ambulance  And she pretty much admitted  That she should have woke up  Maybe she should have  Like  She called and told you this  Yeah  Wow  And now she calls  And she curses  She hates our show  But she listens every day  No she hates that  We're sexist  She says  She loves Jimmy Norton  She wants  Yeah cause she's  I wear a Spiderman shirt  And it just does something to her  And she wants to take the helmet  And just  Blah blah blah  But she's embarrassed about that 
[03:20:30]  Because she's probably 75  Alright  And she shouldn't be having those feelings  Yeah she's some older woman  So there you go  Now you're kind of caught up  She's out  On her  She's clearly hours of details  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Hey this is Jon Bon Jovi  And you're listening to me  And Opie and Anthony  Right here  On the worst of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  And now  The worst  Just pathetic  Of Opie and Anthony  They call it toilet humor

[03:26:00]  You know  With a little bit of that helplessness  And looking up into the sky  Pondering the question  For all of America with the flag  And have Cody and Cassidy singing backup  Yes  Because that was always a good thing  With choreography  Which is  I mean, it's a little weird, you know  And Frank in the background  Having anal sex with a hooker  Whoa  Oh, that's right  He did try for that, didn't he?  Didn't he?  It's been so long  Well, guess what?  You know the funniest part about that, too  Is like  If you ever get turned down  Trying to have anal sex  Oh, you look bad  It's really bad 
[03:26:30]  But it's just between you  And whoever it was  This was out  In the public eye  I mean, everyone knew  He was trying to get the anal  And got turned down  Well, you know what Frank doesn't know?  You're not supposed to go for the anal  On the first  On the first sleepover  You know  How long  Before you went  You're supposed to introduce  You've got to work up to that  Slowly, right?  How long before anal with Marcia?  How long?  Come on  Well, now  Do digits count?  Or just  Actually, she was 
[03:27:00]  Poor Maureen  She was an easy sell  You know, like about  Two pitchers of margaritas  And you are mine  There's been so much  Said about that  She is the only girl  I ever let  Call me Greg during sex  And  Oh, really?  That is sick  That was just a little  You know  We were pretty bored as kids  Quick before mom and dad  Come upstairs  Yeah, who gives a better hum  Are mom or Marcia?  That's a good question  You know what?  You know what used to be really cool  Is watching the show 
[03:27:30]  While you're making out  With your sister  Oh, man!  I know, it's a little incestuous  That is really bad  But something really hot about that  When you're a teen star  Like you've kind of done it all  And been there and back  You need things to heighten the emotion  And heighten the effects  So I used to just create that old theme song up  And go  Here's the story  Of a lovely lady  And bringing up  Three lovely girls  Or just the music  Like when the kids  Are walking down  And says  Oh, we got to 
[03:28:00]  Ugh!  Wait, we got to play  The Brady Bunch bits  For  Oh, we had a lot of fun  I can hardly wait  At everyone's expense  Well, we got some  Really sick ones  Wait, let me guess  You do a little goofing  On the show  A little spoofing  A little sarcastic  You're missing some  Of the wholesome qualities  No, it's not  We just figured  Because  It's not like zoo radio  Around here, Barry  Okay, good  No, our bits are  A little more intelligent  Than that  No bells, whistles  They came up  With a great concept  Well, we figured  Because Robert Reed  Who was your pop, right? 
[03:28:30]  Yes, that would be right  Yes, I knew that  But go ahead  Yes, I was just quizzing you  Designed the house  He was an architect  Yes, I just figured this out  By the way  Because I've only been  Listening to you guys  And the whole time  I've been in here  I'm going  Okay, now which is Opie?  Which is Andy?  And I'm listening  Andy  We always get that  Who looks like an Anthony  And who looks like an Opie?  Yeah, you're right  But I've been listening  I finally figured it out  Yeah  Anthony  Right  Very good  Anthony, I got that right  Let the stenographer record 
[03:29:00]  I am pointing at the right person  The Italian  Sounds like you've been  In some litigation yourself  Hey, don't talk jail to me  I didn't do it  I didn't do it  I wasn't even there  And it's not my car  Really?  I want to know the story  About that one  Okay, so we were talking  I think we were going down  Robert Reed  Played your pop, of course  And designed the house  And he designed that stairs  The stairs  Yes  From the bedrooms  Yes  With no backs on them  Yes  And then the underneath part  Was enough room  For someone to stand  Small child  And look up under the stairs 
[03:29:30]  At the girls' dresses  As they came down  Only Anthony  Was nice  You know  He's got freeze frame  On the television  And he has placed  Transported himself  Underneath the staircase  From day one  What I want to know  What I want to know  Is who is walking up the stairs  When you, Anthony  Are underneath  Looking up  Oh, Marcia  Yeah  Alright, well I can give you  A play-by-play description  And that was always a big  You saw her develop  And everything, didn't you?  I did, I did  And in one night  Yeah, it seemed to happen 
[03:30:00]  Overnight  The whole flowering process  All of a sudden  She went from  The kid with the  Like, wacky crying  I hate you  I hate you  To the hot girl  That the quarterbacks  Of the rival high schools  Wanted to date  In one hiatus  Yeah  It all happened  She went from  Young girl to  Sweet young thing  Yes  And what happened  You came back to film  And you were like  Yeah, Johnny's back  And he's ready to run  Johnny needs some of that  Yeah  There's a lot said about that  You know, I wrote  The book Growing Up Brady 
[03:30:30]  I was a teenage Greg  But one of the working titles  I had was  Growing Up Brady  Inside Marcia's Marsh  And I  Oh  Oh  But we felt it was  A little too edgy  I think she had a  For the newsstand  It wasn't the first time  She got hit in the face  And said, oh my nose  Something else  Happened in there  We have to take a quick break  What's  That damn football spit at me  Oh my god  Hello  I like you, man

[03:34:30]  You could call him Johnny Bravo  Yeah  You could call me Hey You  Or Hey You  One friggin' episode of being Johnny Bravo  And, and years later it still sticks  Well, the suit still fits  Johnny Bravo  Oh, does it?  Of course I had to have it made for me  But that ensured a good snug fit  Who forget, who could forget  Adios, Johnny Bravo  Not me  When you finally got your balls  Say buenos dias, Johnny Bravo  Yeah, what happened there?  You were all dead set against it  Adios, Johnny Bravo 
[03:35:00]  Johnny Bravo returneth  You sold out  Sold out the siblings  You're going solo  Hey  Blowing off college  I had the right idea  I had the right idea  And then, and then  In a twist of just horrible fate  Greg gets the idea that changing his sound is not a good idea  Yeah  Yeah  Who's to say?  I mean, what is the sound?  Say my sound  Doesn't even sound like me  Good thing  It's not about me, man  That one guy  Hey, it's not about me, man  I'm telling you 
[03:35:30]  There could be a lot worse things than fitting the suit  A lot worse things  Which is why I have set out to right that wrong  Yes  A little later  Bringing it back  Bringing it all back  Johnny Bravo  Here we are  You're doing a book signing, Barry, huh?  I don't know  I just point and shoot  Yes  You are, though  And people should show up  And give you love  I would like that  It's going to be at the NBC Experience  At Rockefeller Plaza  Yes  Have you seen this place?  No  It's incredible  I was up there actually today  It's two floors 
[03:36:00]  It's interactive  They've got video things  You can sit down with Jay Leno  You know, they do a little thing  And he's there  And, you know, he kind of pops the questions  And they have an audience that laughs  Like the king of comedy  Exactly  Ma!  Ma!  It's a little scary  I mean, I did it twice  Because I can't get on a show  And so  I wanted to get the full experience  And it was a little creepy  Why the hell wouldn't Jay have you on?  I don't know  Jesus  I don't even know if it gets to Jay  We had to talk to the people  You know, he's about 
[03:36:30]  Well, it's Barry Williams  Jay Leno, John  He's about four layers deep in people, right?  And then you get on the show  Barry, you know, it's great, man  Here you are  We had to blow off Britney Spears  To get a  I did Rosie O'Donnell's show  About a week and a half ago  And I love the Rose  I just  I love the Rose  Well, I'm sure she's very big on the old show  But she says to me  The first thing she says to me  I can't believe  That you  Haven't been on my show before  I've been calling her 
[03:37:00]  Every month  For a year  Saying, Rosie, think it's time  The CD just broke  Just released the book  The movie's coming out, Rose  Love to come on the show  And if she can't believe it  I want to know  Hold my calls  I'm eating a Twinkie  Stop  I'll be right back  Oh, look, see  Oh, we found his soft spot  We found Barry's edge  See, he's friends with her  Because he can't bang her  That's what it is  Don't think she's interested  Don't think she's interested  I've got to spell it out here 
[03:37:30]  I completely understand  So, did you happen to catch  On Fox last night  They did a little  Brady Bunch movie  Oh, Fox did a little  Brady Bunching  Yeah, yeah  A little skimming  Oh, you weren't  You weren't a part of that one, Barry?  I think they called it  The Unauthorized  The Brady Bunch  Do you know why  They called it Unauthorized?  Why?  Because it was  No one had any say  On that one, huh?  No, this is something  That they extract  From what we call  In the business  Public domain  Which means they go 
[03:38:00]  Through a bunch of  Clips from  Entertainment Tonight  And Access Hollywood  And Star Magazines  And base the movie  On that  And base the movie  On that  Oh, by the way  Did I mention  They borrowed  Liberally from my book?  Oh, really?  Oh, sure  Oh, sure  But just enough  To keep the facts straight  Then they delivered it  In a completely botched up way  Well, you know  It really would have sucked  If they didn't get  Such fine actors  To portray them  And look alike  It was fascinating  I mean, I swear to God  I turned it on  And I said  I am seeing myself  It's like a mirror  Here I am  In all my glory 
[03:38:30]  A little fatter  A little taller  About ten years older  And smoking the wrong cigarettes  But there I am  Being very cool  Stuck up  And conceit  Well, they got that right  But the rest of the people  Well, everyone knows  You smoked a valiant cigarette  I believe it was  No, no, man  That was a big V  I'm talking on the show  When Greg got caught smoking  The big V  I can't stand it  Valiant cigarettes  But it wasn't your jacket  It wasn't your jacket  It was your pal  That you were in the band with  And can you believe  My mom believed that 
[03:39:00]  What a line of crap  And that stuff shirt  Mother of your friends  That came over the house  Like, we're doing a meeting  About smoking in our high school  The PTA lady  Mrs. Brady  The PTA lady, right?  What a stuff shirt  And then your pal sells you out  I know  Hey, dude, you left these cigarettes  It's not my jacket  It's your jacket  Oh, Greg, thanks  And then you ratted him out, though  Of course I didn't  You noticed he wasn't on  Our next episode  He wasn't  That's the good thing  About having your own series  Yeah, yeah  It wasn't real  Stop it 
[03:39:30]  You just stop  I watched it  Like 80 times  I know it happened  It wasn't real, Anthony  It's a TV show  And they found out  Because he had ripped it  And Alice sewed up the jacket  So that's how he knew  All right  Speaking of Alice  Here's the litmus test  Yeah  Speaking of Alice  Now we know she made  You know, the meatloaf  And the hot Christmas turkey dinners  Yes  And we know that she actually  And I know this was a trick  Of double photography  But she was actually  Sergeant Emma  And Alice  Same person  Yeah  Okay, we knew 
[03:40:00]  Yeah  But she also  Our beloved housekeeper  Had a last name  Yeah  And I'm just searching for that  Hold it  Searching for that last name  Oh  God damn it  I can help  It's the short term memory  Think Ozzy  And I don't mean  Osborn  No  Not Osborn  Ozzy  No  No  Harriet  Harriet  Yeah, Nelson  It was  There it was  Yeah  Okay  There'll be more  Yeah  Okay  I'm only giving you 
[03:40:30]  Half a point  Because I could see  That it was  I'm trying to think  Of where that  Where that name came out  In one of the episodes  But I can't remember  All right  My short term memory  Is shot  Well now that you have  The next two nights  Of reading worked out  For you  Yes  Yes  You'll be able  To get that fact  And many more  Growing up reading  I was a teenage Greg  Yes  And we thumbed through it  I actually read  One of the books  Was that your book  Talking about how  How Robert Reed was upset  With a lot of the episodes  And storylines  Yes  Yeah  In fact 
[03:41:00]  I had  I interviewed him  Over several days  And he supplied  The actual memos  He said  The memos are great  I think I've got this up  In the attic  And in fact  He was dying at the time  I didn't know it  At that time  But he went up  And he got these memos  And maybe that was part of it  He wanted to  You know  To share  Yeah  Who he was  And what he was about  With this show  Because I think he actually  Improved the show  But these  Some of these  Some of these memos  Were scathing  Unbelievable  Right  Like they would  Write these episodes  And Robert Reed  I think he wanted  To be accepted  As an actor 
[03:41:30]  As a thespian  Well not  Thespian  Lesbian  I won't even get into that  But he wanted to be accepted  As like an actor  And they would come up  With these ludicrous episodes  Sometimes  And he would be upset  With the storyline  Like no  My character  Wouldn't react that way  And write these memos  To the producers  It's like  It's the Brady Bunch  It's like  Fluff fun  Kind of show  Sure  Doesn't have to be serious  He was coming  From a completely  Different place  He studied at the  Royal Academy  Of Dramatic Arts  He was classically 
[03:42:00]  Training  He was accepted  As a thespian  Thespian  And did a lot  Of Shakespearean plays  Or the tights  You know  The whole thing  And  Defenders  You know  Where he was nominated  For Emmy Awards  With E.G. Marshall  So he did have  That whole thing  Going on  And of course  The other thing  He had going on  Now did you know  That he was a gay man  After our second date  Really  Yeah  How many times  Does he say that  I make light  Good kisser  By the way 
[03:42:30]  Greg  Greg  Just not  Not after 5 o'clock  Without a second shave  No  I mean  At some point  You do  I mean  You know  Kind of what's going on  With your co-stars  Right  I mean  You know  Which  Let's say  Which time of the month  To stay away from  Marcia for instance  Really  And you know  What's going on  With Robert Reed  Because you're close  You know when to make  The move  On Florence Henderson  Because she's vulnerable  And feeling lonely  Now as per the  Fox little TV movie  You got  Turned down 
[03:43:00]  By Mrs. Brady  Yeah I mean  That's accurate  I mean  That's accurate  You went out  You went out  On a date  We did  On this one date  Right  You know  And I was throwing  All my best Greg Brady  Moves on her  And I had my imagination  Go on  Electric bottle  Weston oil  In the backseat  In case  With protection  And  By the way  If you ever use  Weston oil  Never heat it  Beyond 82 and one half degrees  You'd get burned  The heck out of your back  And so I was doing all  I had all my  Little childhood fantasies  My teenage hormones  Were raging  And what have you  You must have gotten  So much young 
[03:43:30]  Tail  That you finally decided  You wanted some  Older tail  I needed experience  I needed experience  I was tired of training  All these  You know  These wannabe  You know  Groupies  And I  You know  I just felt  That I was missing something  Now there's  There's Florence  You know  Hair  You were missing hair  And then  You're right  And  I brought  The Weston oil  But not the razor blade  And so  I was 
[03:44:00]  You know  I was hoping  I'd get a little  You know  A little  A little instruction  But you know  She was not  She was not  In that  In that  In that vein  And she was not  Going for that  She let me kiss her  She let me give her  She did  She let me kiss her  Like a passionate kiss  A little pack  Or something  No  I didn't get past her tonsils  Or anything  But I mean  You know  A little like  Wet lips  Oh god  That must have just looked  Oh it was good  It was good  Oh no  But it was great  Fantastic  It must have looked  In my movie  It looks fantastic  It looks great  When is your movie 
[03:44:30]  Is that the one Sunday  Sunday night  On NBC  Nine o'clock  Can you believe  I squeezed a movie  Out of this deal  Wow  Talk about the milk wagon  Now this of course  I have to see  What can we expect  In the movie  Well listen  All the dark  Dirty secrets  I made this movie  For you  Did you  Good  I made this movie  For you  Just for me  Because  Because  I mean  Particularly  If you've like  Heard some of the rumors  Maybe even read the book  That kind of thing  The movie won't disappoint  But instead of just describing  Like little romps  In the swimming pool  Or in the bedroom 
[03:45:00]  I mean you actually see  Like tops coming off  And intertwined  And the towels  And the music going on  And tongue going on  Good passion  Did it  Did it  Did it  Did it  Yeah  You're some of the  Brady bunch  The porno version  Of the theme song  We have cool tunes  Going on in the background  You know like  Crystal blue persuasion  And that kind of stuff  Right the groovy tunes  Of the time  Of the time right  That's something  You kind of forget  Oh yeah  Yeah Marcia  Come here  Yeah  I think I'm having  I think I'm having  An acid flashback  Hang on guys

[03:46:00]  Like she's changed her hair  Yeah  Who could forget  Dawn portrait of a  Teenage runaway  Yes Jan Brady  Running away  Yes  All of a sudden  She's like this runaway  This was shortly  After the show went off  And she's a  Teenage prostitute  Getting banged  I was like  Where do I go  To get a piece of that  For a buck  It's Jan Brady  For God's sake  Hey she wasn't  Charging enough  You know 50 bucks  Really  Come on  It's Jan Brady  For God's sake  Let's go  Let's go  50 bucks an hour  Anyway  And a brilliant stroke 
[03:46:30]  Of concept  Programming  But actually  She's quite good  Anyway  She's over the Brady thing  And we're friends  I mean we still talk  And all that stuff  Yeah  But she doesn't  Like she wouldn't  Come to the premiere  Or anything like that  No  No  Everybody else show up  Well Chris Knight came  And Michael Lookingland came  And Susan Olsen came  And I think  Old Flo Flo  Did Mike drive  Or take a cab  Or something  Not a very good  Race car driver  Man those reunion shows  Were tragic  Not only that  But I mean  There was the mug shot  Who wants to see  Bobby in a mug shot 
[03:47:00]  You know what  You know what  The concept behind that was  They figured  We did like  This boffo rating thing  With a very Brady Christmas  So the network  Like in a typical gesture  Of overkill  Decides  Okay  Let's see  Let's bring the Bradys back  But as a special  No  Why  Well we've been successful  That way  As a half an hour  Like the original show  No  Not enough Brady time  Let's just stretch  This puppy out  Give him a full hour  Every week  And let's see  It's the 90s  We can't just  Travel back  Let's give the Bradys  Problems

[03:53:30]  Opie and Anthony  And now  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  This show sucks  It's awful  Okay  Well  What a crazy crazy show  This has become  Once again today Anthony  Yeah I know  Like today would be different  I don't know what it is  There's this aura  That this show has now  That is just bringing out  The friggin' lunatics  Well you know a lot of people  Want us to start interviewing 
[03:54:00]  You know more celebrities  And stuff  And on a daily basis  You should see the people  We turn down  Because we know  They just don't know  How to play the Opie and Anthony game  They blow  They blow  They have an agenda  They don't want to have fun  They think it's going to suck  So they don't try  There are certain people  That can walk through that door  Sit down  And become part of this show  So we go through a list of people  That call this show  And want to get on  To plug their stuff  Or whatever it is  And we go 
[03:54:30]  No  No  No  No  No  We know this one  Isn't going to be good  Because you can tell  Now Ben Stein  We figure  What the hell  Comedy Central  We have a good relationship  With them  They give us some  Fun guests  That we've had on this program  So we'll throw them a bomb  He gets on  And right after  We were doing a commercial  Where I guess I said  People will be on the phone  When you're trying to sell your car  And try to chew down the price  Chew down the price  That's what I said  It's the car cash commercial 
[03:55:00]  Try to chew down the price  That's exactly what you said  We got the tape  We have a ton of our listeners  As witnesses  We get  Ben Stein is on hold at this point  Hey we're guilty  For saying some really stupid stuff  On this show  But god damn  Call us for that  I'm not going to sit here  And act like I'm a choir boy  Or anything  We are definitely guilty  For saying some stuff  And we don't care about  That stuff either  But we don't like being accused  Of something that we didn't do  Because he was convinced  You said chew down  Especially during the commercial  And then when you explain yourself  Then he was trying to 
[03:55:30]  Like cover his ass  And say well  It just sounded too close  It sounds like it  And if it sounds like it  People are going to think  It is it  I'm a douche bag  Oh  So uh  He's on hold  During the commercial  I say chew down the price  He starts up  The first thing out of his mouth  Is he's got this attitude  That how could uh  You know  Did I just hear someone say  Chew down the price  And I said no not a bit  I said chew  Chew  And then you explained yourself  And then he just rambles 
[03:56:00]  Making no sense  We got the tape  I started laughing  Because I thought he was making  You know a joke  That I thought  It was so insane  It had to be a joke  No one could possibly be this serious  About something  Sounding like something  Alright so uh  Real fast  Let's play uh  Like only 15 seconds  Of the commercial  Yep  Uh where Anthony  Was explaining  You know what  Car Cash does  And used the term  Chew  C-H-E-W  Down  Chew down  Right  Here it is  Three in the morning  You're getting calls  From people  God forbid 
[03:56:30]  There's a misprint  In the paper  All of a sudden  Your uh  Your Corvette  Is being sold  For 20 bucks  And you're getting calls  At all hours  From people  It's a big pain  In the ass  And then the person  That comes over the house  And tries to chew down  The value of your car  And he's looking underneath  Saying well  It seems to be something  With the Ida  Bama muffler bearing  There it is  Try to chew down  The price of your car  As in nibbling  Away at the price  So right after the commercial  We get back into the show  And Ben Stein  Is on our hotline 
[03:57:00]  He was on hold  So he heard the commercial  Right  On his phone  But right now  We gotta say hi  To Ben Stein  Anthony  Ben Stein  Hey Ben  Hi how are you  Did I just hear you  Do an ad  Where you said  Somebody was gonna  Chew down  The price of a car  No he said  Chew down  You just said  Chew down  Oh that's a lot  Different  We wouldn't say  Chew down  On a commercial  We would say it  During the show  But not during  A paid advertisement  Ben  Okay  You being of  Jewish background

[04:07:00]  But  There's  An  Article  In  USA  Today  Written  By  Your  Pal  Ben  Stein  Pal  In  It  He  Talks  About  Well  That's  Sarcastic  Obviously  In it  He  Talks  About  How  America  Is  Becoming  More  And  More  Anti  Semitic  And  He  Mentions  Two  Radio  Personalities  From  New  York  He  Talks  About  The  Chew  Or  As  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He

[04:08:30]  On 
[04:09:00]  Him  And  Like  You  Said  Earlier  He  Sees  Everything  As  An  Anti  Semitic  Attack 
[04:09:30]  Lately  And  Then  This  Is  The  Section  Where  It  Talks  About  Us  I  Was  Being  Interviewed  By  Two  Radio  Personalities  On  A  Big  New  York  City  Station  Before  I  Came  On  The  Air  They  Did  A  Used  Car  Ad  It  Said  Listeners  Should  Sell  Their  Cars  Through  Our  Advertiser  Rather  Than  Something  Similar  Now 
[04:10:00]  He's  Totally  Lying  Yeah  Cause  We  Are  We  Played  The  Tape  It's  Obvious  That  Anthony  Said  Chew  Down  And  In  Quotations  He  Has  Jew  Down  The  Price  And  Then  He  Writes  To  Try  To  Save  His  Ass  Or  Something  Similar  No  It  Wasn't  Jew  Down  The  Price  It  Was  Chew  Down  We  We've  Gone  Over  That  So  Many  Damn  But  He's  Writing  It  As  The  Hosts  Claimed  That  They  Said  Chew 
[04:10:30]  Down  Maybe  So  I  Replied  But  The  Reference  To  The  Ugly  Phrase  Jew  Down  Was  Clear  Clear  Eyes  In  Reply  The  Radio  Guys  Castigated  Me  As  Crazy  For  Caring  You  Are  Crazy  But  Not  For  Caring  I  Think  If  You're  Jewish  And  You  Care  About  Anti  Semitism  That's  Not  Crazy  I  Think  You  That  Sees  Anti  Semitism  At  Every  Corner  Is  Crazy 
[04:11:00]  Maybe  If  You  Didn't  Work  For  The  Biggest  Anti  Semite  In  The  World  Dick  Nixon  Back  In  The  70s  He  Was  A  Speech  Writer  For  him  You  Know  That  Yes  I  Do  Anthony  And  He  Had to  Take  That  I  Guess  Ben  Ben  Where's  My  Favorite  Hebe  Hebe  Speech  Writer  Ben  Stein  Bring  In  My  Jew  Boy  I  Need  A  Speech  About  Those  Little  Nips  In  Vietnam  I  Gotta  Make  Myself  Sound  Good  To  The  Public  How  Could  I

[04:12:30]  Is  That  He  Considers  Anti  Semitism  And  I  Don't  See  It  I  Appreciate  The  Fact  That  He  Would  Be  Upset  By  Anti  Semitism  And  Want  To  Do  Something  About  It  But  I'm  Sure  Ben  There  Are  Plenty  Of  Cases  Out  There  That  You  Could  Jump  On  That  Are  Legit  The  Ones  He's  Listed  Here  In  The  Paper  Are  Ridiculous  You're  Reaching  If  You  See  A  Flight  Attendant  Offering  You  A  Kosher  Meal  Instead  Of  Dry  Fish

I love you, too.  Where in the world is  Matt Lauer? 
[04:53:00]  Sorry.  There you go.  Just bringing up something that I think's stupid.  Where  in the world is Matt  who cares?  Alright.  Those were the days.  Dude, start watching TV  so you can help us out with this radio show.  I don't know what that is. You've never heard of the  where in the world is  Matt. No. When's it on?  What time, first of all?  It's the Today Show. 
[04:53:30]  What time does it start?  It's probably one of their biggest  promotions they have done in the last five years.  I'm glad I don't know it. I'm a 33-year-old guy  and I like getting oral treats. I shouldn't know that.  I love the fact that we do  a radio show with a caveman.  A guy that has no clue  about topical stuff.  I realize I'm an opinionated ass.  I'll explain really fast.  They do this promotion with Matt  where every morning  you've got to tune in to try to figure out where Matt is today. 
[04:54:00]  And he'll be somewhere in the world.  There you go.  Really?  He could be in front of the Great Wall of China one day  and then next to the pyramids.  What time does the Today Show start?  I don't know.  How would I know that?  My TV should be coming hopefully tomorrow.  Why would I know that  even if I had my TV?  What is this magic box  with visions of another world in it?  Ugh.  What is this magic box and how old is she?  Me don't know how to work them. 
[04:54:30]  You're like primitive man.  I'm Tim Technology.  I just don't have a TV.  You are not Tim Technology.  I got to get a TV.  I don't have one yet.  You're polypathetic.  Yeah, but so what?  Chip Chinlis.  All right, we have to take a break here.  Yeah.  So, yeah, WOW is here.  That's why we're spending a lot of time on it today.  The season has begun  and it's just going to grow like you cannot believe.  Uh-huh.  Just wait and see.  Is it going to grow like that big tumor 
[04:55:00]  we saw at the end of yesterday's show?  That rocked.  Someone, I guess, got really pissed off  about that segment and called Ken.  Stop it.  Super General Manager Ken Stevens.  How did Ken Stevens feel that call?  With another PSA?  He goes, yeah, and they try to spin it  and make believe, you know,  they care about women  and that women should get mammograms.  Oh, we were trying to spin it that way.  Yeah, it was.  If you were listening to yesterday's show  and you're a lady  and, you know, you're not getting a mammogram 
[04:55:30]  after that segment, you know, come on.  We also had a cancerous esophagus.  I guarantee because of that show  a bunch of women are making appointments now.  And who cares what your motives were?  Are you stupid thinking for other people whore?  I don't care what their motives were  when they brought those guys in  and what the hell was that,  but I still quit smoking,  so shut your stupid mouth.  There you go.  Oh, your motives are unimportant.  It's what other people do with it  when they hear it.  How's Ken Fielding that call, Opie?  Did he say he's going to react?  I believe he...  New jerk.  I believe he...  No, man, we worked for...  You know what?  I got to say it. 
[04:56:00]  Yeah.  It is...  If you're a radio guy,  it's cool to, like,  hate your bosses and stuff.  Uh-huh.  And, you know,  Ken is easy.  He's a little fruity and stuff,  and he's a little...  He is?  He's a little, like,  you feel like you're working  with your father type thing.  But the guy goes to bat for us.  Well, I'm just commenting  on that PSA that the Seeks  had put on our program  and kind of got through Ken.  Yeah, he had a moment of weakness.  That's what I meant.  He's not perfect.  Yeah.  But, God damn it,  he supports what we do  and he goes to bat for us, 
[04:56:30]  unlike someone that still works  at AF, you dick.  No, I will not rest, Dave,  until you're fired.  That will be someday.  I've been waiting four years  and I'll wait another six.  I don't care.  That will be someday  when he finally gets his ass  thrown out of there  with his 70s gay porno mustache.  Okay, I'm going to go into gay porno.  So, hell.
