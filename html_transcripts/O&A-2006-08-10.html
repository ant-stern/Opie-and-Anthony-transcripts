<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton discussing a recent terrorist threat, juxtaposing it with the trivial stories dominating local news, such as a cream puff eating contest and a woman baking cookies in her car.  They satirized the perceived absurdity of this contrast and the overblown reactions to the terrorism threat, touching on airport security, racial profiling, and the frustrations of air travel.  The hosts also addressed a listener's failed online petition to get them removed from a Buffalo radio station, highlighting the backlash from their "pests" who retaliated by revealing the petitioner's personal information.  This was followed by a humorous exchange about Chicago Bulls jerseys they received, referencing the station's call letters. The segment included listener calls, a discussion of Robin Williams' alcoholism relapse, a fan playing piano, a clip of a drunken Britney Spears, and a mention of a man pointing a gun at the camera during a previous PalTalk broadcast.  The entire segment was punctuated by frequent use of crude and offensive language.

Comedian Bob Kelly then joined the show, discussing his successful comedy tour, including a meeting with Deep Purple's Ian Gillan, and the pressures of newfound fame.  He recounted a humorous, unsuccessful audition for an Owen Wilson movie.  A significant portion focused on his experience filming the final episode of their HBO show, *Torgasm*, which involved flying fighter jets and resulted in him vomiting repeatedly due to G-forces.  This was discussed in graphic and vulgar detail, including descriptions of puke bags and his ginger snap consumption. They also joked about the editing choices regarding Kelly and Dane Cook's vomit. The hosts critiqued Kelly's comedy club biography, pointing out inaccuracies and humorous phrasing, leading to a discussion of his career and independent film roles.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a Chicago Sun-Times photo depicting a protest following a police shooting of a 14-year-old who pointed a BB gun at an officer, using offensive language and stereotypes.  The segment also included listener calls, a discussion of a 1949 dating advice segment featuring a crudely described fictional character named Woody, a brief segment on a home video of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline, and promotion for their upcoming tour and HBO's *Lucky Louie*.  Offensive language and sexually explicit jokes were prevalent throughout.

The show continued with a segment heavily mocking Britney Spears and Kevin Federline, playing audio clips of Spears and indulging in crude humor and speculation about her parenting and appearance.  This was followed by a "walkover" to XM Satellite Radio, where the hosts interacted with several street people, resulting in further crude and offensive jokes.  The Orange County Choppers crew then joined the show, discussing their show's success, motorcycle building process, the challenges of fame, the authenticity of their reality TV show, and interpersonal dynamics within their family business.  The hosts made several jokes about the guests and their work.

A phone call with the Orange County Choppers followed, including humorous speculation about motorcycle vibrations and the types of bikes they might build. This transitioned into an interview with Flavor Flav, who discussed his VH1 show, *Flavor of Love*, including graphic details about a contestant defecating on the floor. He discussed his past, the show's success, and his relationships with the contestants.  This was followed by an interview with Steve Carr, lead singer of Foundry, whose music was played and heavily ridiculed.  The segment focused on Carr's past musical endeavors, his band's single "Pendulum," and his stage attire, with hosts and callers heavily criticizing his music and persona.  Several of Foundry's songs were played, met with overwhelmingly negative reactions.

The final segment centered around Foundry's music, with hosts and callers expressing disgust, amusement, and comparisons to other artists.  Significant crude and offensive language was used throughout. Callers shared anecdotes and opinions, with one suggesting it was "great blowjob music."  The discussion included references to *Flavor of Love*, Stevie (likely a celebrity), and Beavis and Butthead.  A significant portion focused on band member Steve Carr, with contrasting opinions expressed about his talent and personality. The segment ended with more offensive language and promotional material for the show and its website, including references to a "virus" and "napalm."  The overall tone remained chaotic and irreverent, with frequent interruptions and vulgar jokes.

[00:01:30]  opian anthony show the ona virus spreading across america good morning good morning good  morning more terrorist crap swung if you're flying today uh be prepared to fly naked i think i think 
[00:02:00]  you're allowed to fly today if you're naked uh yeah i think that's the uh very next step we got  to acknowledge all the people that are on their way to an airport anthony every morning people  listen to us on their way to a plane leave your luggage at home uh no luggage no clothing 
[00:02:30]  nothing not even the clothes on your back  fox news alert um you must fly nude is what we're getting here at our fox uh information center  let's go to the terror desk where they're saying that everyone must now fly completely nude and your  head will be shaved you'll be shaved of all bodily hair yeah before you go on because you might be 
[00:03:00]  able to hide something in a tuft this is your job today you got to spread this rumor you have to fly  nude today nude they're allowing you to get to your destination as long as you're willing to fly nude yes  you will be allowed to carry one pair of tidy whities in a clear plastic ziploc bag onto the plane  but that is it and that's just so when you get to your destination you don't look silly walking out  of the terminal but yes you must fly nude completely naked i would like to know more about this uh 
[00:03:30]  terrorist plot but the local news uh here in new york they're doing cute little human interest story  so they're doing a story about how sharks might help uh uh predict hurricanes yeah thank you that's it  thank you that's uh that's great i appreciate it you know what i like about hurricanes um you could  see them coming for days how about we get a little more info on this terrorist thing because you can't  see that coming you don't see it coming they made some arrests in england apparently um seems uh out of 
[00:04:00]  heathrow they've pretty much shut down heathrow to any european air traffic uh but there was supposedly  this plot by terrorists to blow up uh upwards of nine planes at the same time in the air with  explosives carried on in their carry-on luggage i thought we were checking carry-on luggage anytime  i go through and i know england's security is pretty similar to ours if not tougher because it's uh  you know right next to filthy europe uh so no more carry-on all they're allowing is a plastic see-through 
[00:04:30]  plastic bag there you go you got your passport uh small purse or wallet uh medication that you're on  and if you have a child with you you could have some type of baby formula that will be scrutinized  i guess yeah no fatty they're taking swigs off your baby's bottle that's always fun at the airport  seeing the could you drink that it's breast milk right and then they get insulted and then they call 
[00:05:00]  the press and they make a big it's really bad story out of it because they have to sit there and uh  chug baby formula in front of some security guard and then uh as far as the u.s goes now they in in  uh england they've raised the um airport alert which is different than a terror alert i guess  to red and then they have to tell you which is the highest level because you'd sit there and think red  i think puce could be higher could be higher some kind of lavender thing but uh it's red there and 
[00:05:30]  they've upped it to orange here which is right below red i don't know what it was at was it at yellow  here shouldn't it just be red all the time as long as we allow these savages uh in this country  why would you ever lower the terror alert it's always should always be red and i believe red is  as we said totally nude air travel that's what you got today that's it we don't know who the people 
[00:06:00]  are that are doing this though i mean you can't look out there in an airport recognize them well  jimmy that's just it you just never know it could be a regular middle-aged american uh white woman  pushing a baby carriage sure with a couple of kids it could be uh i don't know an asian family  walking onto the plane could be um 70 year old black gentleman 70 year old black guy uh deciding 
[00:06:30]  to see some family but isn't it too obvious to to look for just the middle easterners at this point  people will point out believe me they will check dude let me tell you i'll tell you when i'm flying  as soon as you see one even if they're with a family and a million kids you're still like  that guy right it's it's obvious to everyone so i'm you know you got to think they're trying to  figure out something else whether it's whether it's trying to recruit you know somebody that  could like sneak through the cracks or just a completely different way ain't gonna recruit a 
[00:07:00]  grandma ain't gonna recruit uh maybe she doesn't know that you're running the mill family what they  do tuck something it depends yeah maybe she i thought they were just helping her out  exploding velcro right people thought that though again you're not too sure who to look for and the  911 you look at the pictures that's exactly who we should those are the guys oh everyone i understand  that but now it's five years later and it's obvious to everyone when you go to an airport i get nervous  that when you're on a plane and you see a middle eastern person you're like oh my god because it's 
[00:07:30]  still you know 99 of the time it's al-mahid rashad you know but do you think they're that dumb where  they think they could carry off this uh carry these things uh through has nothing to do with  how smart or dumb they are it's their resources they they have trouble recruiting from their own  kind you know what i mean like it's very involved the steps that they take and people still catch on  and they're arrested by the police if they start approaching people that we wouldn't suspect 
[00:08:00]  the jig would be up in a second right not and that isn't a racial comment about him being high up in  an airplane i'm talking about the arabs people from arab countries that's who is doing this the  majority of the time i know there are some homegrown terrorists you know they want to their mommy and  daddy maybe gave them a little too much money when they were kids and they hate the country and decide  that they're going to do something that isn't really the majority of the problem here so you're still  looking for middle-aged to young middle eastern men who are doing this so at the airport if we check 
[00:08:30]  all of them do you feel like we're completely safe then i think if all all the resources go toward that  or most of the resources go toward checking those feel real safe to fly all over the world it's called  racial profiling yes and and it would be safer our resources would be put where they're supposed to be  instead of this political correctness which is putting everyone in danger and having us now fly 
[00:09:00]  completely naked with a plastic bag of our little friggin passport no ipod no nothing you're not  allowed your laptop is now in your checked baggage no beverage no beverage you can't walk in now with  a you just bought a bottle of water maybe a little parched you know uh you cannot get that you now have to  get on your plane and wait until uh the plane takes off uh and the service card comes through  if there's a delay one of those long delays you know you're now sitting there for hours uh waiting 
[00:09:30]  to get a drink just so you don't offend somebody who's a problem to the bottom line yeah we are  they're not dumb we're dumb and they know we're dummies they know we're too stupid and too afraid to  actually just profile the way we're supposed to they didn't blow anything up but they've just made it  completely inconvenient more more inconvenient to go about our daily lives here in uh this country  accomplish their mission right and that's one of their missions is to disrupt our lifestyle in this  country and now they've done it again more security uh you can't bring beverages on and uh it's going to 
[00:10:00]  be really embarrassing when you're naked all right let's go to don the trucker don what's up  what's up what's up hey man hey i was listening to fox uh opie and uh they said they got three more  so that brings up a total of 24 right now that has to be fox news and not local fox news because local  fox news has a cute little story how you could get a cell phone for your dog yeah well we were talking  earlier about how the local news affiliates gave up like uh your local fox affiliate not the fox news 
[00:10:30]  channel gave up because they know when a big story hits you're not going there you're going to cnn or  you're going to fox news where depending on your political affiliation uh that's what you're doing  they're british they're calling british muslims and now they're they said they're still looking  about 30 more of them over there all right thank you don yeah we know they're muslims it's funny  all right that's the first time i've heard the word muslims i know it hasn't said so on the news or 
[00:11:00]  anything but you know of course they're muslims stop it and england has a huge problem over there  with uh muslims they they you think we're politically correct over here with them they're  just they treat them with kid gloves over there hey uh really fast you thought i was kidding  so fox news channel all over this story right yeah here's what fox news locally in new york is doing  all right so when you guys go on a picnic is that you or your husband hauls around the big cooler  i always wanted to go to picnic and i've never been able to oh do i want to use the c word 
[00:11:30]  oh god following around the cooler take a look at this new contraption it's called the prison cooler  i love it it's a motorized scooter big enough to haul a case of beer eight pounds of ice and a beer  bellied biker it's uh made its debut at the annual biker rally in sturgis falls south dakota we all know  about that thing it sells for between 350 and 500 bucks and i think it's cool  this is i gotta fly with my junk out she should be doing the news on her knees like with a mic like 
[00:12:00]  headset on while she's scrubbing a toilet please this is i we do not we're not making this up this  is what they're doing it's a huge story as far as terrorism goes and and affects all of us right  and they're talking about a cooler there are people that are probably getting dressed getting their bags  uh by the front door maybe turning on the news want to hear about this how it's going to affect  them at the airport figure you turn on your news and what do you get here's a cooler with wheels on 
[00:12:30]  it and in all fairness that's like a human interest story we know that of course but when there's a  big news story they usually drop out to human interest stories that's the point i'm making here  you know and then uh that was like a minute and a half piece they could have done another minute and  half on the the terrorist plot terrorist plot world war three uh the beginning of world war three and  oh yeah there's world war three happening and there's all kinds of stuff and what or give us an update on  uh stephen hawkins and how he said uh earth is doomed earth is doomed earth is doomed where was the update on 
[00:13:00]  that no i want to know more about uh earth is doomed i don't want it to be just a headline one day and  it goes away like like a britney spears headline we get the stupid uh weather man who can't improv  oh he had a good one this morning oh they were talking about the uh hurricane mike warwick yeah  and how the sharks could uh predict uh hurricanes and help us predict the weather and uh the woman  reporter brought it up and he was like well you know i don't have um i haven't heard about that one 
[00:13:30]  yet and just completely lost track of what he's got oh he had nothing he had nothing he's on the  news and he talks like a witness who was just caught lying right yeah he stammers like a guy who has just  been called out you know what's sad zero improv skills before our dumb radio show he was uh no one  was noticing no how awful he is at improv and we had to point it out to everybody oh he is the worst  they're going to get in the back room so we'll get that on the radio adam and yonkers what's up 
[00:14:00]  hey good morning boys good morning how you doing um i was remembering uh listening to uh one of jim  norton's jokes a few years ago he basically said anyone with more than one hyphen in their last name  shouldn't be allowed to fly that was after it's funny it was after and i and i wrote that dumb joke  after richard reed who had no hyphen in his name was arrested for attempting to attack an american  airlines flight but it was just you could look at the guy and know he's a problem but you know of  course and even if you bought the ticket and kit we're just dummies and they know we're dumb we're 
[00:14:30]  too frightened to be honest about it like look yeah sorry guys but are we more afraid of offending  a group of people uh or plummeting from 35 000 feet to your death uh what what are you more afraid of  excuse me i think that's easy if you're looking like say you get a plot that decrypts in the  bloods are going to cause a problem somewhere uh-huh are you arresting asian guys or white guys 
[00:15:00]  or 50 year old no yes you would be in this country because we don't want to offend nation and and and  they'd get through to do whatever they want because we'd be looking in the wrong places because we're  not looking where we're supposed to be looking young to middle-aged arab muslim men uh with that  let's go to ryan in new house yes ryan hey good morning good morning hey uh i was on a flight  coming back from dallas uh i think it was about december of 01 and uh standing in line at the gate

[00:16:00]  watched the whole time and another guy sat in the front the other two guys that were doing all the  yelling they didn't even let him on you know they and they could have been just guys that were  late for the plane probably were guys but you know something they're going to be looked at like  that because that that's who fits the bill sorry sorry that's how it goes you have to be pissed off  at the people doing it if if there was constant terrorism being committed by white pale men with  crew cuts and tiny genitals i wouldn't be angry if i got talked to every time i was at the airport

[00:19:30]  terrorist it's all about the terrorist today terror alert where it's red  we're taking it very seriously and we're a comedy show i got another example if you're just waking up  uh they were trying to blow up some planes in midair between london and and uh the united states there  was a plot a plot they're not telling us how far along they were with this plot but they arrested 
[00:20:00]  a bunch of people over there uh uh the plot had serious al-qaeda connections terrorists planned  simultaneous attacks on the planes up to nine planes at the same time uh being blown up with bombs carried  on on their in their carry-on luggage can i ask why the terrorists and why they go to nine planes if  you're gonna do it just why not just go with ten why would you do a nice even number yeah i figured 
[00:20:30]  it would confuse everybody and then have the tenth guy nine i didn't see that coming i would have  thought ten nine yeah that's just everything you're doing in ten it's very metric they don't want to  be metric they want to trick us because they are metric over there yeah so they want to think  eight point seven planes so uh the point we're making though uh we're taking it seriously cnn is  taking it seriously fox news channel taking it very seriously local news in new york and i'm sure this is  happening in your city as well uh business as usual business as usual you were talking about  the shark hurricane thing yes this is exactly what anthony was talking about a few minutes ago 
[00:21:00]  still ahead on good day wake up a cigarette smuggling ring busted where the rest of the money  went and why cops say there could be a terror connection so john has nothing on these underwater  meteorologists how these sharks could keep you from you know stay from a hurricane i didn't know that  they could get their meteorological degree sharks i didn't either but i guess we're about to find  out interesting stuff he's i didn't know either i did and that's why are you talking to me his name's mike 
[00:21:30]  wood i think and he oh thanks at improv they take him by surprise i i almost think it's a plot  time i think it's a plot by the rest of the news i thought you were gonna ask me about uh this other  thing you know i have this queued up why are you asking me about the shark thing every time he talks  he looks like he's talking to a husband who has just walked in and found him banging the guy's wife  i wasn't we're friends at work we met at work i dropped my contacts i guess i i 
[00:22:00]  this dope has one job tell us how warm it's gonna be and if we need an umbrella and he also knows the  story leading into what he's gonna do so he has a good 20 minutes to figure out one lousy line he could  that's it spew on tv he knows how to pop the graphic up and then read like that it's going to be  80 degrees and partly sunny today and uh here's the shark story god because this is much more  important than terrorists blowing up planes today of course it is 
[00:22:30]  so mikey you gotta listen to this one okay because your job to be affected here oh yes scientists have  found a new way to tell if a big storm is ruined you just send out the sharks who need meteorologists  researchers in florida noticed that when storms blow in the sharks so they head out to sea they  say the sharks notice that change in barometric pressure okay scientists are attaching transgenders  to the backs of the baby blacktip sharks and when the sharks swim out of the bay they say it sets  off a signal which means a hurricane could be on the way okay well man excuse me i'm taking the day off 
[00:23:00]  exactly we'll just get a tank in here and have a shark swim around and tell us what the weather's  going to be when they freak out it's time to go exactly right yeah all right so since we don't  have a shark you're still got a job um he i'm revoking his blackness well that was revoked yes  i'm making a move he's not he has to paint himself white when he goes to work oh my oh oh okay oh well 
[00:23:30]  thank goodness how can't you there's too many things wrong with that story by the way there's just too  many things wrong with that whole clip him with the complete lack of ability to improv and talk  like a human being can riff off a story like that no no the other thing and why isn't he saying this  is completely ridiculous is the story itself right it's completely ridiculous sharks might be able to  tell that a hurricane's coming how about the billions of dollars worth of satellites that take  pictures of hurricanes uh days right weeks before they end up anywhere or when she said uh you know 
[00:24:00]  sharks can help with the weather he should have said shut up bitch no they can't hurricanes just  show how stupid we are as human beings yeah you know it's coming for two weeks and you still don't  get out of the way two weeks and believe me it's not a tornado it comes down surprise the hell out of  you and your family yeah those things just pop out of the air a hurricane is coming at you for two  straight weeks now i understand for the a lot of the two weeks it's kind of whipping around you're not 
[00:24:30]  quite sure where it's going oh yeah no you know within a hundred miles you have a pretty good idea  within a hundred miles each way where it's gonna hit and these idiots are surprised well i just didn't  see it coming you didn't do you own a tv did you see that big white thing coming your way i have a hard  time feeling sorry for the people that decide to stay stay behind i know stop some people a very very 
[00:25:00]  very small percentage of people have no choice very small percentage who the rest could get out  i don't think anyone has the is in the position where they don't have a choice just get out just  get out all right elderly we got lots to do let's move on for now we got uh fix the edge dot com the  pass the on a pass and for the new listeners you'll learn about the pass uh in time but um it came to  our attention that some ass in buffalo good morning buffalo by the way morning buffalo see this is how  our show works we're now paying a lot of attention to buffalo we were paying a lot of attention to

[00:27:30]  uh dregs of society are the pests of this program i was howling reading those posts yesterday and the  names some of the funniest stuff comes out of those idiots brains the guy probably clicked on  it went 600 hits wow it's really picking up steam this is working making some headway it it started  out he had like um just about he just broke the 100 uh postmark on uh his petition he's gonna get 
[00:28:00]  this petition signed and send it off to citadel broadcasting and really make a statement  well most of them were pests already uh but then when we announced it it went to thousands of posts  and it was all pests and really really funny stuff using obscure lines from the show using names that we  used years ago in some bit pat barringer says pat barringer turned up from the mondo uh topless tape 
[00:28:30]  old gravy leg had to chime in the art of the past yeah and just it is an art form to be a  pest the art of the past ridiculous comments that are all inside jokes lines from movies yeah lines  from full metal jacket and the shining doing mornings no their health doesn't allow it doesn't allow it  by the way just to go off on a quick tangent we almost blew up our careers yesterday we had a guy  um shoot a gun live on our show on pal talk after we left you uh yesterday yeah when we continued on xm 
[00:29:00]  it got a little ugly yeah he was pointing guns at the camera that we were looking watching him on  pal talk camera he was pointing his 45 at it it got a little nerve-wracking yesterday on the second  half of the show but fun anyway fix the edge dot com is no more yeah well he seemed to have changed his  tune after the pests got his name the name uh his name address phone number the name address and phone  number of the person and company that runs the actual site that he was just kind of borrowing 
[00:29:30]  a little piece of uh like a friend that said okay you could use a piece of my site and this guy had  some kind of business on it kind of pop-up banner business and um the pest put a stop to it so quickly  by getting all this information and using it like they do in a pest-like fashion uh this local guy named  don no it isn't me who's a big fan of shred and reagan who was publicly asking management of the edge to  put shred and reagan back on in the morning by using an online petition has taken down the petition 
[00:30:00]  followed following requests by management of the edge citadel and which is the edges parent company  basically the edge didn't like the fact that there was tension being caused between the fans  of their am drive and pm drive shows opie and anthony fans are loving every minute of this shred and  reagan probably got their asses chewed out for not even doing anything gotta love corporate radio  obsessed fans and the internet all three make our world a very interesting and entertaining place  to live and then there's an update uh shred and reagan addressed the issue of the fix the edge 
[00:30:30]  dot com issue tom reagan said and i quote there's no war between us and ona shred and reagan thought  the petition was funny they love the listener support but don't want to battle between the  fans of shred and reagan and opie and anthony shred and reagan also talked about how ona discussed  the online petition during their show this morning evil jim shred and reagan producer said there's  nothing bad going on between the two shows reagan summarized it as a misunderstanding and shred  said he wants to talk to opie since the two of them used to work together on the fox uh back in 
[00:31:00]  the day uh he also said opie changed his phone number and shred doesn't have the new number  uh shred you know that's not true my cell phone is the same buddy i don't know still uh i don't know  uh still uh what does it say here all right i don't know silly radio stunt to get people to  listen to both shows or is it just passionate fans who have taken things to another level and then  there's the statement by uh dan now this was what he had changed his original website oh i i got this 
[00:31:30]  one that's actually on the website now is that the one i just read god he keeps updating how does your  start that uh 103.3 the edge and foopons foopons.com okay go ahead yeah i think that's the one yeah this guy  dan uh had posted uh this website and bashed us and said that we shouldn't be on the air and asked  for our removal and everything well the pest got to him and now this is in place of that last statement  that bashed us uh buffalo area listeners 103.3 the edge and foopons.com have requested the removal 
[00:32:00]  of this petition yeah how about the pests i would like to thank those who showed their great western  new york spirit and signing the petition dude you had about 50 people that signed that  but there was 181 when it was brought to our attention but anthony's anthony's still right  because yeah a lot of them were our fans and then all the rest of them all the rest of them  after that point were pests were our uh guys however it was never my intention to cause such 
[00:32:30]  a division between the edge listeners you didn't foopons.com the host of this page spoke with  the edge and came to the conclusion that my page was doing more harm than good to the team at the  edge shred and reagan and opian anthony are friends outside the radio waves and do not desire to have  their listeners against each other my simple wish was to get the buffalo community to rally together  to support a local radio team that has been with us for over a decade so support them so you do now 
[00:33:00]  support them support them they got some great opportunities ahead of them right this is a good  move for them too you just don't know that yet i would like to formally apologize to shred and  reagan the edge and ona and foopons.com for any problems this petition has caused best of luck to  shred and reagan thank you dan and i say thank you to the ona pest of course no listeners like them  they're the luca brazzi of radio oh aren't they yeah just carry out orders don't care what the 
[00:33:30]  consequences are they have no consequences you know most most listeners under certain situations  of normal radio shows would cower when the pests step it up another notch when when they call  radio shows and the radio show goes we have caller id here here's your number and they recite the the  the pest's number the pests give them something back like okay good call me tonight when i'm effing your  mother like they just they don't care that they have your phone number the address pictures of them they 
[00:34:00]  don't care they'll send them pictures naked fully you know ready to rock they they're awful with no  conscience the conscience they're like the terminator you can't reason with them but and there's other  fans that like don't like the pest but it's like when you read these posts how can you not laugh reading  this yeah it's funny man it's really funny yeah you gotta get involved go to opian anthony.com and uh

[00:35:30]  we all have numbers yes and i thought they were just numbers but anthony figured out the puzzle no i  didn't i gotta give the credit to um oh fan or uh one of our guys behind the scenes for reading the  note that was in with the shirt that said that they did it like this well my number's 10 and anthony's  is five and jimmy's is nine right number nine doesn't mean anything right no just a number till 
[00:36:00]  you put them together one oh ckg's trying to get wacky five nine we might have to slap him around a  little bit and they requested that we put these on and stand and take a picture and stand with them  on in line what they are going to get is nine thousand one hundred and five because okay i will  not stand in the wackiness they want us to be in line so it matches the call the number of the station 
[00:36:30]  i figured out how we're going to do this all right maybe we don't take the pictures maybe we hang on  three different urinals we hang these up and you take the photos in the proper order we're not doing  that what are we going to do 105 uh there's supposed to be a period uh between the five and the nine so  quick search the building for the for the right gal get little molly wait do we have three urinals  yeah yeah in the uh in the big room is there three or there's only two there we'll do this at xm  because there's three urinals over there they get a picture of us taking waiting taking leaks and

[00:54:30]  oh jeez you are a big guy man you have a job if you lost weight going on too man it's zz fat  comments are coming in with a different meaning yeah he's zz bottom i was really hoping not to relive  this part of my life and i have to be careful what i say to jimmy when we're on the on the road trips  because i would do this was a conversation we had when we were out buying shoes in boston see  i just came up and i i i actually asked someone for paper to write it down yeah so when two men 
[00:55:00]  are shoe shopping yeah oh perish the thought something comes out like this told them about  the outfits i used to wear on stage too and some of the that that stuff is some of the greatest  moments on the opian anthony show when you're just walking around with a show member and they feel  like they're just sharing and all of a sudden the the person that is listening goes get me a pen  immediately give me a knife and a pen the knife goes in your back it happened and the pen writes  down what you just said it happened to me when i was watching jimmy at the montreal comedy festival  yeah and they had this weird show where you had to tell stories and make them funny like they have 
[00:55:30]  all these crazy themes when you go up there it's not just straight forward comedy you know they do  special shows and there's jimmy uh comedian after comedian just telling horrific stories  stories uh that chick who was really funny talking about uh uh giving oral to like a really old man  because he because he was desperate she's really funny we should have black hair she's quirky she's  kind of um kind of fat uh big boned really edgy she didn't make last comic standing which i was 
[00:56:00]  amazed by because he's really really funny and she knows how to tell the story i forgot her name  would love to give her a plug and then jimmy goes up there and casually does his monster range story  and i went to the waitress can i borrow your pen please yeah i need a pen and i didn't even write  that one on a napkin it was right on my palm and i was like making sure it was dark and it wasn't  going anywhere anytime soon and then got back to my hotel room and wrote the whole thing out and i  said to myself someday we'll be back on the radio someday wasn't that like july of 03 or so i was a 
[00:56:30]  weird like i i was like i hope for guests like anyone remember that yeah now there's shirts and  every day one day one first break on the air pack oh yeah jimmy tell uh the monster range story  i i i i i i i i'd rather not anyway we can play the britney spears uh audio a little later in the  show we should take a break all righty we really should i was i was saying we were i was on youtube.com  last night the opian anthony representation on there stinks does it there's a guy out there he's adding 
[00:57:00]  videos weekly and i appreciate that it's some weekly w-e-a-k uh well yeah i mean some of the  videos are definitely worth watching but uh we have some legendary stuff that has to get up on youtube  because youtube is all the rage blind boxing should be up there our rape videos up there and it's getting  hit like crazy and it's also on opian anthony.com because i guess if you go to youtube you got to  register just to watch the rape video because it's a little it's a little it's a little crazy they have 
[00:57:30]  dirty stuff up a little too edgy i don't think they have dirty stuff but when stuff starts leaning  toward dirty you got to sign up for youtube.com to check it out i don't think they're doing the  actual porn stuff i'm not sure to be honest with you but the rape videos up on opianthony.com the one  we did from from the one traveling virus thing but uh we got to get better representation on youtube.com  yeah get some of the old tapes up there we're getting there i guess before we take a break we  could do a quick uh robin williams update i'm sure you've heard by now but just in case here's the story 
[00:58:00]  actor robin williams is seeking treatment for alcoholism the 55 year old comedian had been  sober for 20 years but and unfunny he found himself drinking again and wanted to deal with it  williams stars in man of the year movie comes out in october also his new film the night listener  is now in theaters you know who i thought of when i um heard this story in the gym yesterday  old jimmy norton why no because i was thinking like jimmy's been sober since uh 17 right 
[00:58:30]  no 18 18 february of so about 17 18 years or what have you give or take okay robin williams  clean for 20 years you think he's got it beat well i think that would be 20 years for me i mean oh 20  i think i'm 19 now 87 to uh 06 yeah so if it could happen to him you're thinking that i was thinking  we got to ask jimmy about this because i'm thinking you make it 20 years stupid me i'm thinking you got it  you got it kicked yeah you got it kicked i'm thinking after a few years you got it kicked 
[00:59:00]  all it takes but that's that's where i'm just dumb yeah no it's you mean it's like uh i feel bad for  him man it's just like i i mean i've only met him a couple times but he's always been really nice so  it's like you hate to see a guy like that you know put his face in the bowl well he was a legendary  partier back in the day yeah you know he was there when belushi did his thing right yeah yeah i think  he was probably the last person to see him alive or something like that one of the  he's been sober for 20 years and he starts drinking again yeah how does that start you  think just a little wine at a wedding or something i mean how does it you stop doing what it was that 
[00:59:30]  got you to be sober for 20 years what maybe you go to certain meetings maybe you belong to a 12-step  group and when you stop being active there uh they what they say who forgets to remember do them to  repeat well that's what it is forget where you came from when you see people drinking do you want to  drink no normally remind me of why i don't oh i watch these people start off like having fun at  eight o'clock hey hey oh gossip you know and then four hours later they're throwing up i never like  blacks so it always reminds me of why i am not doing that anymore i watch great careers by the way thank 
[01:00:00]  you for holding my head that night that's all right what was in my lap i fell off the older i get it's  it's so much easier not to drink because of exactly what jimmy just said you see how silly  it is around you yeah but it's hard not to not drink and be around that like if you go to a party or  you're at a bar or an event or something and a lot of people are drinking and you're not that's rough 
[01:00:30]  because then you just look and and within within a half an hour to an hour everyone in the room is  annoying to you because they're all buzzing or some of them are already hammered so you're just  like get me out of here i'm around so many people that don't drink some just because they don't drink  some who are really just sober almost everybody i know i mean you know voss and some other people who  you know what i a lot of people i know are kind of yeah so yeah most people i know are not problem  drinkers so it's a little bit easier because of that so there you go there's uh robin williams in

[01:03:00]  of alcohol from all times louis louis like wow so you really go out of your way this is madonna  this is an interesting inside stuff i don't want to smell it um i don't want to smell it i don't  want to you know have a bottle they'll a lot of times put it into a glass now for me because he  doesn't care louis like yeah whatever man don't worry it's no big deal like it doesn't hurt this  i'm gonna look for that now yeah wait a minute that's a root beer bottle yeah i don't see i'm afraid  i'll smell it in the bottle because you know your your your senses are still pretty acute  right yes smell all right adorable your senses not just a cute oh guys let's say hi to bob

[01:04:30]  on on mcdougall street screaming into your cell phone yeah well you know i can't i'm cracking under  the pressure you think yeah well yeah i'm cracking under the you know i i remember last year it's like  uh i had a gig here and there and it was fun and i prayed to be able to work every weekend and make  some money and now that i'm actually working every weekend i just i just long for those days that i  sit in my underwear and with an xbox remote in my hand oh my god you're all days you just nailed it 
[01:05:00]  with everything that's going on with us with this show just exploding in front of our eyes  yeah there's a little uh anxiety and and and panic us you know moving in yeah it's like we long for  the days too where we could just do our stupid show and go home but every day it's something we  have to deal i want i want the um the all the success i want all the new stations i want all the  press i want everything that comes with it i just don't want to work yeah any harder than i did years  ago i just want to know that i could get it like the auditions tell me you got the role robert hey 
[01:05:30]  thank you and give it to somebody else i'm going home dude you want to tell about how much i suck  i auditioned for an owen wilson movie where i had like three or four lines in it i'm on a show  and i didn't get the part that's how awful i am like they couldn't even find a little part for me  in there the casting director that loves me because i stink what'd you do with your hands i don't know  i should have picked i should have put one on the back of my head and the other on a pistol  and had the two meats hey bob i saw the uh the last episode of tourgasm yeah you got you want some 
[01:06:00]  lip chap you want some lip chap opie well what happened was i guess you guys a year later did one  last episode right yeah we did uh hbo needed a little more from you guys huh yeah we did they had  a film uh like i think it was a month and a half ago two months ago to film one last episode  of california i can't even imagine doing what uh what you guys uh did they they went up in the  plains i was mad man because i you know i broke my knee my tooth man my hamstring dude and uh 
[01:06:30]  and uh i was i told him i go dude make sure it's nothing dangerous and dane actually was pissed too  he was like make sure whatever it is because he didn't want to know what it was right uh so  don't make it so nobody gets hurt and we pull up it's like dude fighter jets  it's not even like hurt we could die you moron yeah so they go up in these fighter jets and they're  having uh dog fights dog fights yeah dog fights at six thousand feet and you guys control the planes 
[01:07:00]  i didn't really get that you're you're you guys were actually controlling the planes they got pilots  let's not get carried away this i talked i actually met one of the pilots at the palms casino like uh  last month right i was talking to him you do fly you do they do let go of the stick at six thousand  feet right and you he just goes go left so you just crank the stick left like a video game yeah  you get in trouble these guys can recover in like a second yeah they they kind of like you're you're 
[01:07:30]  pulling four g's so you're trying just going trying to keep the blood in your head  it's my favorite sound ever i know the best part is they're talking to these guys before they go up in  the air and also bob kelly looks at the camera goes that's it now i'm flying what they ran through a  few things for an hour and said okay you guys are ready to fly these things yeah these guys are i mean  these guys are really in any they reference top gun and they're really just hard-ons and they really 
[01:08:00]  love what they do and they love me the guy told me to eat this is this this lunatic told me ginger  snaps why because i guess it helps you not puke the ginger oh yeah i love ginger snaps did you eat  it of course he did he's bob kelly of ginger snaps i'll i i there's a reason i asked that i'm getting  at something he ate the ginger snaps because they said that would prevent him from puking yeah when he  landed one of the funniest things i've seen in a while on tv he gets out of his jet with two puke 
[01:08:30]  bags completely full to the top completely tippy top really you were yakking in there wow was he  yakking the guy the guy told me he didn't know i had a food addiction so i ate every ginger snap in  the place uh and then i was up at uh as soon as we did the first turn the guy was i was like i'm  gonna puke and there's these little bags and i just puked all over it and it's so funny too dane  puke but apparently the uh video didn't make it uh uh-huh why why wouldn't look cool and it has fans 
[01:09:00]  i'm fat and bald wouldn't look cool yeah it's okay to show up wait man you're filming a reality  did you puke he's gonna be on our show soon we're gonna have to ask him about that yeah definitely  did you puke from nerves or from like motion sickness or from the g's what was it  it's no i was literally upside down at six thousand feet and then you you pull the stick  back again and you're going straight up to the moon pulling like four or five g's and i my stuff i just 
[01:09:30]  couldn't handle it i couldn't you were weightless it was when you came back down these lunatics are  going down left up hold on and you're just doing it because you're a freaking you know you're a cow  you're a cow you're just a retard going okay and you still want to look like an ass on film  and uh as soon as you level out you don't you're not sick while you're doing it as soon as you level  out and you see the horizon yeah every your whole head is it's just on the ground everything's on the 
[01:10:00]  floor all right  bob kelly is goose  silly yeah did you did you have a scene in the locker room where you were in your towel  clenching your teeth at maverick  hold on we're making fun of you here 
[01:10:30]  uh what bob what we didn't hear you what are you trying to say i said uh the regular pilot  you're saying bob sorry the top uh gun music's a little too loud let me let me uh pot this down 
[01:11:00]  a little bit i said that the uh  the uh the uh the uh yeah whatever dude  the uh the worst and best sound effects ever 
[01:11:30]  the art of the puker  it was the it was the weightlessness that got your uh stomach and the disorientation with the horizon  oh yeah it's really beautiful until you had 6,000 feet in one of those little planes uh until you uh  and literally i just i just cranked the stick to the left  propeller or jet  propeller  oh  those little fast ones look like bees  wait so you were uh you were weightless  yeah i yeah well this is the this is the thing is that when you're pulling g's if you pull four g's 
[01:12:00]  if you're 240 times that by four  wow  and when you reach like the peak they do what did they did he do an emelman or something where he kicks  the rudder over when you you're like you go straight up and then and then you stop you're  pretty much stopping me there oh reverse yo-yo yeah  and you're weightless at that point  uh excuse me for us dummies what's a reverse yo-yo  it's a maneuver to get um behind somebody you use a climb and then uh uh roll and the fact that you 
[01:12:30]  know that twist over the fact that you know that you have a flight simulator i've played a lot of video  games that's pretty much it it's the only reason so you're weightless  you can't get out of your house to take gloom no my house never leaves the ground bob  i don't vomit i'm eating and playing  so the thing that upset your stomach actually made your feet thank god  that was a good one jimbo  it certainly was jimmy  well touche 
[01:13:00]  um and i got a major problem here because i got your thing you're at the stress factory tonight through sunday right  yes uh stress factory jersey okay um it's uh seven three two five four five haha is the phone number  halting uh great club awful number yeah the bio bob um who wrote this uh the bio for the club  uh no this is boston native robert kelly  uh oh uh that would be uh matt frost all right is this on the stress factory website or 
[01:13:30]  is that where it is okay so go there and look at his picture  you it looks like a john leguizamo death mask  yes wow it really does your eyes are shut you're looking up  bob looks dreamy  dreamy it's like you're contemplating something like should i model or should i  hold on people are calling us out on some crap here uh bob said they did not show dane cook puking  right  they did not show dane cook puking but yes they did show dane with a puke bag that has something in it 
[01:14:00]  well this is the problem  because some ass is like call me out i thought you watched the show hope i did  he left his plane with a little bag of puke saying yeah i had a problem up there too  but they were showing bob kelly puking his butt off  yeah dane's bag actually had a hole in it which was pretty funny  so when he grabbed his bag there was no bottom so he just puked all over his little tight jumpsuit  i hate people that call us out on stuff and they're not paying attention 
[01:14:30]  did you get any kills there bob  uh i got you know what it's all this is what i found out that part of it  because you're really just going up and down and upside down  they're kind of controlling the speed they they kind of let each other you know win  so they let dane win they pick who's going to win  oh really it's like professional wrestling in the sky  that photo on the site actually that's the site uh that's the photo that uh when i got molested in the closet 
[01:15:00]  that's the exact that's the guy took that snapshot just before he did  it certainly looks like it  all right so what's wrong with the bio there jimmy  well like comedy bios are always atrocious and it starts off okay  um boston native robert kelly is a constant and popular presence in comedy clubs across the country  now i know bob i'd kind of like to slap his face for that but for a bio it's acceptable  fresh from performing and taping tourgasm of dane cook  robert is back in the clubs and colleges doing what he does best 
[01:15:30]  and then there's a dash making you laugh  ah like the dramatic pause it's almost like the double take  robert is where's bob he's doing what he does best  well what's that  making you laugh  oh  yeah  robert kelly  were there any other choice  that and that and uh  vomiting  vomiting and eating food  robert kelly is one of today's hottest young rising stars in the stand-up comedy scene  apparently in parentheses they forgot to put hottest young rising stars who's 35 
[01:16:00]  oh jeez  do you want me to replace that with fattest jimmy  would that mean  no no no no i mean hot doesn't mean your appearance it's just that you're on fire you are doing well  you're an overnight sensation  yeah  yes  bob bob  ignore the 20 years that it took to get to where you're at today  is it true bob that they tell your audience to eat ginger snaps before they see you  wait now  i love the callback  that was a callback  this native from boston started his career in a sketch comedy group 
[01:16:30]  then decided to go solo four years ago  quickly becoming a demand in clubs and colleges across the country  first of all you've been solo for a lot longer than four years  and i don't like the fact that they're saying you're where's robert kelly  we can't get him  i demand you get him  we've been trying for years it's impossible  he's book solid  you want to go to a comedy show  not unless robert kelly is there well we can forget it because he won't be 
[01:17:00]  oh and i love this because here comes an exclamation point  oh boy we know only jimmy can read exclamation points when he takes the stage he gives off a non-stop energy that grabs the audience's full attention and never lets go  he never lets go he never lets go without attention  he never lets go oh sometimes he wants to  or he'll tease  oh boy i tell ya  but when they're all facing you and you have a microphone it's amazing that you keep their attention 
[01:17:30]  always keeping his act fresh and new  kelly's cutting edge humor and strong dynamic presence keeps you laughing into the next joke  oh  does it  what are you supposed to do  normally most of us stop  we do a sonnet and then we get into the next joke  you don't want to get him laughing into the next joke  absolutely not normally it's joke  obituary 
[01:18:00]  joke  joke  eulogy joke  but not bob  no siree  bob's dynamic presence keeps you laughing into the next joke  my god almighty  45 minutes of this  i can't take it  no wonder you're in demand  his routines  oh boy  oh boy  his routine  uh  consists of  mischievous  oh 
[01:18:30]  and playful situations  they're just mischievous  they're playful  they're not like you know  crazy and mean  yeah they're  mischievous  mischievous and playful situations  marshmallows  what do you do  go out to the parking lot  and put potatoes in people's tailpipes  while they're watching your show  no he wouldn't he'd eat them before the gag was over  well wait  mischievous and playful situations  that we can all relate to  in our years of growing up  college  and relationships  that's what bob is  you're just full of mirth  and mystery  mischievous little thing 
[01:19:00]  nothing harmful here folks  just good natured fun  bring the kids  that's why he's in demand  no wonder you're in demand  fun for all  thank you  here we go  uh  more exclamation point  robert is an expert  in making you laugh  at all the strange  things we do  i'd like an example  of what you're an expert in  making people laugh  and that's strange  i'd like  an example  well uh 
[01:19:30]  jim have you ever talked  baby talk  i haven't  yes you have  alright you got me  we all have  you're in bed late at night  and the girl  she walks in  do you want me to poo  on your chest  yeah  poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo  none of that went through  poo poo poo poo wee wee  keep it up  stop stop stop  keep it up  and we'll be on a van halen song  yes  apparently  they're dumping out  bob is also an expert  at saying things  that you can't say  on the radio  right  that's right  but uh  way to sell your comedy show  you know what i want to know  pick the dirtiest thing 
[01:20:00]  that we can't play  you know what i want to know  about bob  what  is comedy his only forte  i don't know  let me take a look here  and see  i'm gonna say  it's funny  you should ask that answer  oh  comedy isn't his only forte  what else can he do  this guy can act too  there's an exclamation point  this guy can act too  which at the stress factory  this weekend  lucky you  he'll be doing a scene 
[01:20:30]  he's doing a scene  from probably apocalypse now  i can't wait to see it  um  he and jimmy are gonna do it  except there's gonna be  uh his words are gonna be  typed under his head  what  wait no i didn't get it  uh  found the film actor  and i thought  oh that's pretty funny  my eyes always bug out  and i stink  and he's not really far off  you put a smiley face  or a frown next to your text  on your script  that's funny 
[01:21:00]  um  uh way to go bob  just start hurting the people  around you  all right  in the last couple of years  robert has filmed  three independent movies  last night at eddie's  yeah  i starred in that  yeah  yeah  last night at eddie's  i'll check you a romantic lead  hold on  all right  in the last couple of years  robert has filmed  three independent movies  last night at eddie's  the koala bear kid

[01:24:30]  i just saw that actually  very interesting between uh  during our breaks  what goes on on pal talk  very nice  want to explain to the new listeners  we got cameras in studio  pal talk cameras  and people check us out  uh  as we do our radio show  yeah we got cameras  but then they also have cameras  at their houses  while they listen to the show  and watch what we're doing here  during the show  and during commercial breaks  they can listen in  on the behind the scenes stuff  and uh  look in on what we're doing  and um  every so often  a girl likes to just flash the uh 
[01:25:00]  flash us  and everybody else in the room  very nice  i want to acknowledge uh  chicago once again today  you guys see the front page  of the chicago times  sun times  it's right in front of you there  yeah  it's a big story in chicago  cops question laws on fake guns  another shooting right  there was a 14 year old kid  he's got this gun  it's a bb gun i think  but it looks uh 
[01:25:30]  like a like a real gun  and then there's a shooting  that takes uh place  and uh  and all hell is breaking loose now  in that area of chicago  of course it is  this week's police shooting  a 14 year old ellis woodland  who police say pointed a bb gun  at officers  illustrated once again  that there's no way to tell  between some of the fake guns  out there and the real ones  some officers say the guns  have always been this real looking  others say they have evolved  from smaller more obvious fakes  to the slick imitations  such as the 9mm smith and wesson  look alike  that ellis an 8th grader 
[01:26:00]  allegedly was pointing at police  when he was shot monday evening  at division and uh  and uh  well  clibborn i guess  clibborn  clibborn  clibborn  clibborn  in response to the shooting  chicago police officials  have started talking about  whether laws and penalties  regarding bb guns  are strong enough  to protect both police  and the public  from the danger  they pose  department spokeswoman  monique bond  said blah blah blah  and it goes on and on  but the front page 
[01:26:30]  of the chicago sun times  i guess there's a big protest  and a rally going on  of course there is  and uh  the cops smiling  as  as the black dude  that has a finger  pointing at the  at the cop  is  is just a great  great front page today  yeah  you know the guy  is accusing him  of being a racist cop  and the cop is probably  restraining  from knocking this guy's  teeth out  uh because there's people  around  it's a guy in like uh  what do they call it  is that a daishiki  or it's like uh  no no no  not that head thing 
[01:27:00]  the the uh  yeah he's wearing  some kind of um  it's like a bed sheet  he's wearing  a bed sheet  well white is in  very very oversized  white t-shirts  are in  in the beauty  you know what  that's what my  no that's just an  oversized white t-shirt  that's the look  that's in now  that is big time in  along with a pointy  white hat  and a hood  that's the weirdest thing  the black guys  are wearing  starting to dress  like the clan  are wearing these  oversized black t-shirt  uh white t-shirts  they're really really in  and then he's got  something on his hair  cause you know  you gotta protect 
[01:27:30]  your hair  I don't know  this kid  look  when I was in  8th grade  I knew not to  point a gun at cops  oh yeah  what do you expect  him to do  you didn't do it  when the black  community protests  I mean we know  you like to protest  but why in a case  like this  where the kid  unless this is not  what happened  but if this is what  happened  and if he was really  pointing a fake gun  that looks like a real  gun at a cop  what do you expect  the guy to do  what do you expect  he wants to go home  to his family  he's not gonna  take any chances  nah but I guess  since there's no  shootings in certain 
[01:28:00]  areas of Chicago  he should just  kinda go  ah maybe that's a kid  with a fake gun  he should risk the fact  that he might get shot  and it looks too much  like a real gun  what are you supposed  to do  so the front page  we check out the  front pages of all  the newspapers  especially in the  cities that we're  broadcasting to  and this one  takes the cake  today  this is the best  one we've seen  the cop is just  smiling at this guy  as this black guy  is just giving him  the business  pointing at the cop  and he's kinda  being held back  by one of his homies  and the smirk  on the cop's face  is priceless 
[01:28:30]  and you know  that's just really  pissing off the black  guy even more  you see some of  this other story  an amazing shot  what  the other story  that isn't highlighted  because I guess  this happens  you know  a few times  cop standing  standing behind a tree  about 10 feet  from a teen  with a gun pointer  and the officer  had just seconds  to decide what to do  he was yelling  drop the gun  I'm an officer  but the teen refused  and instead kept  the gun trained  on him  in the middle of  Southside Street  as neighborhoods  looked on  the officer waited  a second more 
[01:29:00]  but not because  he had doubts  that the weapon  was real or not  two years earlier  he'd shot a 12 year old  after the youth  pulled a real gun  on him  and he didn't want  to have to go  through that pain again  finally the teen  dropped the weapon  the gun turned out  it was a cigarette lighter  and the cop said  I never knew  until he dropped it  and picked it up  that it wasn't real  so  who's  who the hell  is stupid enough  to point  at anything  that looks like  a gun at a cop  look  I gotta say  it's always the fault  of the racist 
[01:29:30]  white police officers  never the fault  of the black community  I think that should  be the motto  of this show  why can't this  kid just be stupid  sorry  he was stupid  look you don't want  to see a 14 year old  take a bullet  but if you're that  dumb in 8th grade  you're not going  to invent anything  we're not missing much  if you're that stupid  that you think  if you're 5  that's one thing  if you're 14  and you point  a fake gun  at a cop  you're a dummy  what are they  protesting 
[01:30:00]  what are they  looking to get  just another excuse  for the bad behavior  of one person  we get it  it's always the white cops  it is a BB gun  yes  it wasn't just  a toy gun  could have put  an eye out  that's right  I'm a dude  Diallo is different  he had a wallet  he had nothing  that resembled a gun  I understand people  being angry about that  there were a few  panicky Pete's  got a few cops  all firing  at the same time 
[01:30:30]  a few more bullets  will fly out  than they should  and we're just  making a joke  because we don't  really need to  discuss that again  that was a crazy  scene here in New York  a few years back  but I don't understand  what the protest  is about  fake gun  real anger  like how could  they possibly  be angry  at the police  for this one  the cop  had a gun  pointed at him  and he did  what cops do  when they have  guns pointed at him  shoot the guy  for the same reason  they cry racism  when you're busting  certain drug dealers  and then complain  when cops don't do  enough to get drug dealers  they're not in the 
[01:31:00]  neighborhood  you know  they don't come  into the neighborhood  and take care  of these things  and then there's  a shooting  a cop shoots a guy  the family friends  come running out  they gotta call  back up  they're shooting  at ambulances  it doesn't make  any sense  at all  what are they protesting  oh the whole thing  is just silly  if you ask me  very very  very good front page  yeah it's a great  Chicago Sun-Times  cop's face  is just like  hey how you doing  maybe I'll see you  on the street  yeah  I'll pull you over 
[01:31:30]  guy pie pointing  you know  you shot a young brother  yeah that's what he did  yeah  alright  Kristen in Grand Rapids  what's up  hey I just want to say  I'm so glad you're here  I work for Continental Airlines  in Newark  and I listen to you  when I'm there  but I don't get to  listen to you here  so I'm glad you're here  Jimmy loves your airline  thank you  it's the only airline  I'll fly  Jimmy we look for you  all the time  to see if you're  on our flight  you go to Grand Rapids  a lot  I've never been  no  well actually  we look for you  through Continental 
[01:32:00]  to see if the flight  I'm working  I have two flights booked  I have Houston  and Dallas booked  Houston  Houston  hey does  when you fly  from Newark  to Grand Rapids  is that like  an Embraer  that you fly  yes it is  okay  they're safe planes  but they don't have  like the amenities  of big jets  we have the  cuter flight attendants  okay then email me  godspeed  eatabullet.com  Jim Norn's website  I love you  why do I have to be  your pimp  you're his biggest fan 
[01:32:30]  thank you miss  alright let's go to  Gooch in Cleveland  Gooch  what's up fellas  hey  hey Jimmy  is it okay  if the cops  shoot a kid  a drunk Irishman  for walking down  the street  with a butcher knife  not only is it okay  but they should  shoot him in hindsight  they should have  actually got me  three days later  and shot me  just for being  such an ass  yeah you were  a silly goose  back then  dope  he did his thing  if I had a fake gun  I probably would have  done the same thing  in some depressed bid  but you know  everyone's saying  this gun looks real 
[01:33:00]  yeah  really real  what are the cops  supposed to do  they should start  manufacturing them  I'm sorry  I know  Ted Nugent  just sit back  get on  Uncle Ted  will straighten you  right now  I'm sure  Ted Nugent  would disagree  you know  cause you know  I just like to  shoot an elk  do ya  Ted  do ya really  and the little  cancer boy  he just wanted  to shoot a bear  so did ya  he had to murder  that beautiful animal  wanted something  dying before he  had to go  yeah  well the toy guns  they have  they have laws 
[01:33:30]  where they have to  have this red  front on them  and have to be  colored orange  cause I remember  as a kid  we used to  you know  play army  and you'd buy  guns that looked  like real guns  that was what you did  but they didn't  really look like  real guns  back in the day  I kind of did  I had an M16  that look  it was a little  smaller  you can tell  it was plastic  though  they put out  some pretty good  metal ones too  and then I had  a BB gun  that looked like  a 45  my parents  were cheap  maybe they were  my guns didn't  look real  you got like  second rate guns  if we were lucky 
[01:34:00]  to have guns  usually we had  to find sticks  that kind of  look like a rifle  oh that is sad  I remember the kid  on the street  we all had guns  and there was this  other kid that lived  next door to us  and he actually  had like a mounted  .50 cal  and everybody  really liked that one  but we had our guns  and there was a kid  that was too poor  he used to go around  with like the sneakers  that were ripped up  the front  so when he'd run  down the street  he'd hear like  whoopsh  whoopsh  whoopsh  because his sole  of his shoe  would slap  on the pavement  and then he'd duct tape it  and he was the kid  with the stick 
[01:34:30]  and he would find  a stick  that kind of  looked like a gun  and he was all  proud of his stick  oh is that you  I would carve it  a little bit  oh that'd make it  look a little more real  can they stop  making fake guns  I'm gonna say  that enough already  stop  why  um it's just  fake guns that look  like real guns  I think  yeah our culture  has just changed  too much  the bottom line  is where it's  a violent  violent  there's no  redeeming value  for them at all  why should kids  that want to just  play bang bang  shoot them up  cowboys and indians 
[01:35:00]  play army  that's what we did  as kids  why should that  be ruined  because a certain  segment of society  wants to point  these at cops  and make them  look like real guns  I understand that  argument because I  think it's gotten  to a point where  like the problem  outweighs the benefit  of a bunch of  dumb kids running  around going  gotcha partner  play something else  go online you  little computer  faggots  enough already  well there's just  some lovely youth  are there  let them play  pick up sticks 
[01:35:30]  pick up sticks  I played pick up  sticks as a boy  hey can we  change gears  because people  are going to  get mad at us  we never get  to the stuff  we're supposed  to get to  yeah downshift  for us there  there we go  yesterday we did  what Molly grows  up  yes  Molly grows up  about Molly  getting her period  yes she did  for the first time  and mother telling  her what to do  well today 
[01:36:00]  it's dating  do's and don'ts  dating do's and don'ts  from what  1949  this ought to be  relevant  they all sound  like they belong  in leave it to  beaver  yeah  it's that same  delivery but  they're talking  about weird crap  yeah  so dating do's  and don'ts  from 1949  we start with  this clip  how do you  choose a date  whose company  would you enjoy  by color  well one thing  you can consider  is looks  Woody thought of  Janice and how 
[01:36:30]  good looking she  was  he'd really  have to rate  to date  somebody like  her  yes he'd  enjoy that  except  she's a  communist  what is he  trying to say  that this  girl's out  of his league  I think  he was getting  at maybe  looks aren't  as important  even in the  40s  I wonder  if he met  Janice  and she  turned out  to be  a giant  sea face  looks like  Janice 
[01:37:00]  looks like  this guy's  gonna have  to pick  the fatty  that's  pretty obvious  what's going  on here  Woody used  his BB gun  to point  it at Janice  and force  her into  his basement  gotta love  Woody  yes he'd  enjoy that  except  well it's  too bad  Janice always  acts so  superior and  bored  there's another  word for that  yeah  there's another  word for that  that's what  they call him  or Woody's  a two and a  half  he asked her  are you about  a size 14  and could you  help me put  this chair  in this van 
[01:37:30]  she's a  senator's  daughter  in a  well  in his  basement  she'd  make a  fellow  feel  awkward  and  inferior  well perhaps  someone who  doesn't feel  superior  there's Betty  and yet  I think  what Woody  needs to do  is grab her  by the hair  and give her  throat  a good  lesson  see the  superior  acting ones  you gotta  spank them  right  beat them  down a little  bit  take them  down a peg  or two  let's see  what the  next girl's  about  well it's  Betty  right 
[01:38:00]  Betty  there's Betty  and yet  it just  doesn't seem  as if she'd  be much  fun  what about  Anne  she knows  how to  have a good  time  and how to  make the  fellow with  her relax  have fun  too  GFE  Anne carries  a rubber  glove in case  you want the  extra special  part of the  massage  she knows  how to  put a  happy ending  on your  date  Janice and  Betty are  busts but 
[01:38:30]  Anne is a  goer  Anne's a  good egg  I love  these names  she's a  goer but  doesn't look  too good  she's got a  problem  she's got a lot  of facial hair  or something  wrong with her  and that's why  she's a  good egg  she's a  goer  Anne is  fat  how to  make the  fellow with  her relax  have fun  too  yes  that's what  a boy  likes  he wants  to know  he's  appreciated  Anne would  be fun  on a date  so Woody  decided he'd  ask Anne  for this  first date  but just  how should 
[01:39:00]  he ask  her  and what  if she  refused  no it  won't be  easy  asking for  that first  date  never is  never is  is it  so Woody  put succinyl  choline  into a rag  and date  raped her  with her  eyes  we're gonna  learn how  to ask  for a  date  great  there's  three  different  scenarios  here  how do  you ask  for a  date  what  about  this  what  uh  Anne  well  how about  a date  well 
[01:39:30]  I  well  really  no thanks  Woody  oh  Woody  flames  that was  terrible  in flames  to hear  Sam  asking  for a  date  that's  terrible  I'm  sorry  yeah  god damn  rich  boss  wow  Woody's  a zero 
[01:40:00]  hey  you wanna  oh golly  gee  you wanna  help me  clean the  human hair  out of my  axe blade  in my garage  yeah  no thanks  Woody  well suppose  he did it  this way  hi Anne  what's he doing  Saturday night  well I  I guess I'm  busy  oh yeah  threaten her puppy  any chance of giving him  the brush off for me  full of all the nerves 
[01:40:30]  what did he say  hey what did he say  I messed that up  go back a little bit  go back a little bit here  what the hell did he say  any chance of giving him the brush off for me  full of all  wait what is he saying  she has another engagement  yeah and he goes  any chance of giving him the brush off  for me  the brush off  oh oh oh  pretty nice  well I  I guess I'm busy  oh yeah  any chance of giving him the brush off for me  full of all the nerve 
[01:41:00]  oh well  of all the nerve  she didn't even say she had a date with a guy  he's just assuming she's a slut  I love it  hey you whore  yeah  what are you  who are you going out with  get a look at this  you a size queen are you  skinny Woody  has a big surprise  well is there another way  Anne  this is Woody  well I have a ticket 
[01:41:30]  for the high team carnival Saturday  and  well would you like to go  why yes Woody  I'll have to talk to my folks about it  but I think I can go  that would be fun  yeah  well shall I  pick you up about  eight o'clock  that's fine Woody  eight o'clock Saturday  I think it'll be alright  but I'll let you know for sure  bye  Canada Chris  back it up a little bit  from Canada of course  looks like Woody's 
[01:42:00]  going to end up  in the meatpacking district  cruising around  in a 1992 Saturday  so they're going to go to the carnival  and at the end of the night  they're going to park  the Studebagger  and Woody's going to wind up  with Clown Mouth  oh Woody  I should have warned you  the carnival  what an awful date  the carnival  let's go to the freak show  have some cotton candy 
[01:42:30]  so you get a sugar rush  and babble even more  you whore  you know it's just a freak show  with like people with  down syndrome in it  something you couldn't  get away with now  but would really be entertaining  moving on here  they have now done their date  oh they did  and Anne's little sister  asks about her big date  ah  please tell me  she has to pick Woody  out of a lineup  he stopped  and picked up  four of his 
[01:43:00]  negro friends  on the way  to the carnival  what happened  in the back  of that Studebagger  what are you doing  why aren't you  being crazy  little sister  I'm getting ready  for my date tonight  with Woody  oh he's nice  a date huh  what'll you do  go to some fancy  place for dinner  no silly  we're going to  the hygiene carnival  and then you'll  bring me home  oh that doesn't  sound like much  we'd have fun 
[01:43:30]  at the carnival  you and I  wouldn't we  oh yeah  well Woody  and I  are going to  have fun  just that way  I think the  important thing  about a date  is to have  a good time  you don't need  to spend a lot  of money  to do that  you just enjoy  whatever you're doing  true  whether it's  smoothies  or parties  or anything  and you leave  your boyfriend  enough money  so he'll ask  you again  my  you'll be out  late  why not  particularly late  mom and dad  and I 
[01:44:00]  have an agreement  about what  time to come  in  look  leave me  ahead and get  my stockings  from the bathroom  sure  you don't need  money to have  a good time  all you need  is a front seat  and a knife  I like the way  they thought  before the date  obviously  she's like  hey  leave them  enough money  so I'll take  you out again  she's no gold  digger  get my stockings  which ones  the ones with  the holes  cut out of the  crotch  I'm gonna  I'm gonna play  hide the ping pong  balls  let's go to 
[01:44:30]  Brandon in  Oklahoma  little call back  here  yes Brandon  I want to hear  the one  if you could  forward it to  where Woody  asked Ann  to go to  the comedy  club  she said  yes  and then  rolls him  oh  well  if we only  knew who  you were  competing  with  it was  it kind  of got it  wrong there  Max in  Dallas  what's up  hey boys  what's up  hey Jimmy  is a  Studebaker  like a  homeless  Chevy  Studebaker  oh did I  say  Studebaker  did you 
[01:45:00]  say  beggar  I don't  remember  probably  I said  it too  then  I was  wondering  why  I didn't  get a laugh  you said  it already  I thought  you were  just  calling back  my  Studebaker  no  I was  just  picking  an old  car  because I  didn't  hear your  joke  what  non-listing  bouncing  people  when are you  going to  play the  audio  of the  40s  Moby  actually  Moby  what's  up  what he  sounds like  ONA  interviewing  a hop  chick  yeah  he's all  nervous  you know  what to  do 
[01:45:30]  you bet  you're  bippy  later  Dave  in  Pennsylvania  Dave  ONA  this stuff  is hilarious  guys  and it  occurs to  me that  Woody  sounds  disturbingly  like a  young  Jimmy  Norton  no he  sounds  like Sam  he doesn't  really sound  like me  a lot  it's  smoother  than I  was  a lot  of  instant  feedback  coming in  the two  sisters  talking  about  the  date  and  did  you  give  up  the  brown  eye  why  no  not  on  the  first  date  and 
[01:46:00]  why  are  you  walking  like  you  were  riding  a  mechanical  bull  funny  you  should  ask  sis  when  I  go  out  on  a  date  and  do  the  topless  the  art  of  the  topless  ample  Anne  going  out  on  a  date  all  right  Woody  asked  his  parents  if they  were  excited  about  their  first  dates  so now  he gets  advice  from mom  and dad  here's  Woody  talking  to his  parents  were you  excited  the night  of your  first date  I sure  was 
[01:46:30]  so was  I  I took  my date  seriously  a date  was a  major  event  why the  night  of my  first  date  my date  had a  flat tire  and he  was an  hour late  and he  didn't even  bother to  call me  well when  he finally  came I  had to run  upstairs and  do my  face and  my hair  all over  again  and then  we parked  the car  and he  messed my  face up  who would  have thought  that stuff  stains a  black shirt  oh my god  an hour later  her face was 
[01:47:00]  already a  disaster  yeah what  hell is this  woman doing  stupid pressed up  against the glass  and how was he  gonna call you  cell phones  hadn't been  invented yet  so I guess  instead of  changing the  tire he  should have  walked four  miles to the  gas station  and told this  no putting out  pig that he  was going to be  an hour late  instead of just  fixing it and  getting there  yeah what the  hell is he  supposed to do  god damn  Jimmy you make  some good  points  sure  the cell phone  mom's a  slut  Chester's  liver  Woody I  can't I  can't this

[01:49:00]  father  you really  said that  and he meant  it  that's great  like you lean  in and go  can I smell  your breath  yeah and then  when she  went to  breathe in  my face  I lean  in and kiss  her  any chloroform  yeah do I  push her  into the  shallow grave  before or  after I do  that  thanks that  advice  that's like  stealing  that's like  rape almost  it's a kiss  oh he's a  sweet boy  who check  your cervix  for any  problems

[01:56:00]  nothing but  CNN and Fox  News  Fox News channel  nothing but  MSNBC  nothing but  local news  fluff pieces  all day long  for you  a lot more  to deal with  on local news  more important  issues  while the big  boys do the  heavy lifting  you got the  little girls  in news  that's an insult  to women  by the way  I'm sorry  but I mean  the local news  they're just  the worst  they're just  the worst  instead of  talking about  what's going  on over there  in London 
[01:56:30]  and the terror  plot  they're doing  stories like  this today  alright  Lindsay Lohan's  wild ways are  affecting more  than just her  career  insiders say  neighbors want  her out of  the posh LA  base  the Chateau  Marmont  a source says  her late nights  and friends  constantly come in  and come in  and out  and are very  disruptive to the  rest of the  clientele  meanwhile a fellow  cast member  from Herbie  Fully Loaded  has anonymously  posted a letter  supporting a  producer's recent  lament about her  bad work ethic  and coming up  later this hour  Nicole Kidman  is also being  wooed but  you'll never  guess by whom 
[01:57:00]  we'll let you  Al Qaeda  thank you so much  what annoys me  is why that  actor posted  whoever it was  posted anonymously  why  another coward  I don't want to  do my job  then keep your  mouth shut  and clam up  another one from  the WB  here in New York  City  when I say CSI  what comes to  your mind  the TV show  no CSI  as in crime scene  insects  before the human  forensic scientists  come in  some of Earth's  creepiest crawlers 
[01:57:30]  such as a  cockroach  a beetle  and most commonly  a fly  help uncover  the mystery  the life cycle  of a fly  is the egg  the larva  the pupa  and then the  adult fly  the adult flies  will lay their  eggs into  the openings  of our body  and eventually  become a fly  so if adult flies  are found near the  body  then scientists  know that the  body has been  there for at  least the fly  life cycle  or three weeks  bugs  help people  actually solve 
[01:58:00]  crimes  so while bugs  aren't armed  with the most  high tech  forensic equipment  don't underestimate  the insects  in sight  there you go  that's what you  get today  instead of  news on the  terror plot  21 arrested  no longer able  to bring liquids  on your plane  you gotta fly  naked today  let's not  fly naked  they're gonna  take your clothes  to the airport  I know a lot  of people are  on their way  to the airport  we're warning  you ahead of time  you know what  they're gonna do  you know when  you have to  bring your luggage  over to that  area where you  give it to the  guy and I guess  they x-ray it  and then put it  on the plane  there's just 
[01:58:30]  gonna be a big  dumpster  and they're  gonna throw  your luggage  away  no carry-on  and they're  gonna ask you  to disrobe  and you must  board the plane  completely nude  and if you don't  they think you're  a terrorist  and you're gonna  be in deep  trouble  full body cavity  search  and she said  what does CSI  stand for  I can't quite  figure  I can't get  the first part  but I have  some  sucking idiot  I just don't  know where to  start  hmm  well think about  that  they're just  a bunch  of dopes  there's no 
[01:59:00]  local news  anymore  no  you gotta go  to the big  boys  alright  a little  taste here  of Brittany  and Kevin  sounding very  high  in a home  movie  K-Fed  K-Fed  perhaps they  were intoxicated  well  is that what  they're saying  about this  tape  or they're  just as  dumb as  they look  well that's  okay  K-Fed  rules  let's play a  clip and we'll  decide  are they  high or  are they  just stupid  that's the

[02:01:00]  going on  and on  and on  that's  terrible  I'm sorry  it's gonna  turn out  to be  the biggest  disaster  in  entertainment  history  how great  is that  every picture  they have  they show  her with  those  really  fattening  Starbucks  drinks  she can't  stop herself  good  she is gonna  be a fat  mess  after a couple  of kids  you know  you gotta  kind of  watch what you  eat  so you can  snap back  not her  cause she thinks  she's Britney  Spears  she does  oh she's Britney  Spears  but she thinks  that's what's  gonna get her  by in life  yeah  yeah right  she read her

I was listening to a Mondo Topless bit on Tuesday, and right when I heard that narrator 
[02:26:00]  say, Norwegian nymph, I lost my mind and I dropped the freaking weight on my damn foot.  It's all bruised.  Yeah, we're going to get more of that audio in maybe another week.  Are you guys doing more of the, you guys are doing more volumes?  No.  Yeah, maybe one, maybe two more.  Maybe.  All right.  It's running out of steam, but we'll see what else we got for that.  Thanks, Jeff.  All right.  We got the Orange County Chopper dudes here. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, boy.  How great is it to have all guests and they show up on time, ready to go?  It's a little weird, right?  I know.  No use to it.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  I see the dump sheet.  What happened?  There was a couple of things that maybe were taken out of context.  Oh, boy.  That could have been left in.  I think there was one mistake.  Bob Kelly wouldn't shut up with his poop, poop, poop, poop.  How long of a dump was that?  It's actually the most clever bit he has in his act.  I spit my almonds in his dumb face. 
[02:27:00]  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  Well, can we have the little thing?  Nick, live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  It's just our own blithering idiot, Steve.  It's 7.15.  Giving oral to a really old man.  Saying oral is okay, but giving or receiving is not.  So you could just go, oral.  Oral.  Oral.  Polo.  You just have to talk.  You just have to say, remember that picture, Mr. Hershiser? 
[02:27:30]  That's right.  You can't use it in any context.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Try to pull out an old 20-year-old Dodger player joke.  That's true.  7.48 a.m.  Have a girl poo on his chest.  Poo, poo, poo, poo, poopy.  Bob Kelly on the phone.  And 11.29 a.m.  Well, what controversy.  When he finally came, he made her face all messy. 
[02:28:00]  And a reference to her face looking like it was covered in mayonnaise and in her hair.  Opie reading in instant feedback during a segment on dating.  In this context, came is clearly a reference to ejaculation and not a reference to finally showing up for the date.  But I do believe it was when he finally came, he made her face all messy.  He was talking about how late he was.  And then when he finally came, got to the house.  Yeah.  I thought I was going to get dumped out on the fist line.  Because I said, you know, going to give her the fist. 
[02:28:30]  Punching Girls is okay.  But I didn't clarify.  Punching Girls is all.  We could talk all day about slamming a girl in the face with your fist.  Right.  But you can't talk about using your fist to pleasure anybody.  Very nice.  And that was dumped out of.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Texas.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Oh, we've been that twice in the last week you've been raped now?  Yeah, pretty much. 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  You are some victim.  I think you're asking for it now.  They're a whore.  It's how I'm dressing.  I'll admit it.  All right.  I'm out.  The rape video is up on opianathlete.com.  When Opie does the tapas, the Mexicans just can't stay away.  That guy had me laughing hard.  We'll take a quick break and get the guys in because they got here early.  Yeah, we'll do that.  They shouldn't sit around.  And it's the Orange County Choppers.  The guys are here.  And we'll talk to them in just a few minutes on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:29:30]  What the hell is going on?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Who know they know?  You're crying, sir.  Who know they know?  Who know they know?  Who know they know?  Check this out.  The crux of bacon.  This is strong.  The crux of bacon.  Tag in, dumbass.  The crux of bacon.  Who's hot?  I'm a huge fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  Yeah, yeah, big fan.  No one cares. 
[02:30:00]  Go.  Ask yourself.  Okay, Johnny.  Go.  Oh, man, this is so intense.  You suck.  Thank you very much.  Sucker.  Hey, shut up.  You're going to read it.  Here you go.  I'm going to read it.  That's a winner.  Check, please.  This bit's gone. 
[02:30:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Very busy day today.  Is it?  It is.  We got the gang from Orange County Choppers in studio.  Club Soda Kenny, one of our guys, a huge fan of the show, by the way, so he wanted to 
[02:31:00]  say hi to you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  I watch one of my boys all the time.  We don't miss an episode.  The way you work those tools is terrific.  Those tools.  Those tools.  You're talking about the employees?  No, I'm not talking about his sons.  I'm talking about the wrenches and stuff.  Right.  The wrenches.  What do you like about the show, Kenny?  Yeah.  No, they're for real.  The old man's always yelling at everybody.  Like you?  Yeah.  There's the Fredo brother of the family.  Fredo.  Why is he the Fredo brother? 
[02:31:30]  Fredo.  You're talking about Mikey, right?  Yeah.  Mikey's Fredo.  He's a cool guy, but there's always the black sheep of the family.  You know?  And I think he's the first to admit it.  Mikey?  I'm a black sheep.  Why would that mic work?  I think I'm more of a Tom Higgins.  Why would the mic work?  No, of course not.  Sorry, Tom, you're out.  Hold on.  We have to turn mics on.  You know?  And then the other brother's like the brains of the family.  He gets like all the work done.  Because the old man, like he should take it easy now. 
[02:32:00]  You know, he goes, he lifts weights.  You know?  And then he just like looks around.  Is my shop clean?  You better clean the shop up.  That's a great...  You know?  Chrome this.  Do that.  Do that.  He just yells at him.  He's barking out orders all the time.  You've got to simplify the show.  Yeah.  I break it down to street level.  Yeah, I see that.  I've never seen you gushing before.  This is as exciting as he's ever been about a guest.  No, these are cool dudes.  Let me...  Are you a one percenter? 
[02:32:30]  What's a one percenter?  You're not, though.  No, you're not.  All right.  No, because, you know, you've got tats and everything.  You're a one percenter.  An idiot.  Yeah, exactly.  One percent of the population is as stupid as you are.  One percent of brain capacity.  These guys have no idea.  We've never seen Kenny excited before.  Ever.  Is that right?  Never.  Yeah.  He's like our bodyguards.  Security guys.  Dumb as dirt, but he could kill somebody in a second.  We've had Ozzy in here.  A lot of major people, and he's never done anything but professional, and he's gushing. 
[02:33:00]  These guys ride motorcycles for Pete's sakes.  I've watched him in the episode right now.  They do a lot of good things.  They built like a 9-11 bike.  They built one for the Yankees.  They go down to Bike Week.  Yeah.  These are like macho men.  Yeah.  They're building one for Caddyshack.  The Caddyshack bike.  Well, what about the O&A bike?  What are you guys, chopped liver?  Maybe someday.  Yeah, well, when you compare it to 9-11 and Caddyshack, yeah, it would kind of fall short.  They were probably thinking about it, and now they've met us, and they're like, oh, we're 
[02:33:30]  not going to build a bike for these.  No, they realize you have the number one national radio talk show.  That's why they're on your show.  Wow, look how excited he is.  My son just gets all.  Yeah.  These guys, though.  They got a big...  I'm talking.  Whoa.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Come here, Spider.  You got balls, Spider.  Come here.  No, they got a big TV show for years now.  How many seasons?  We're going on our fourth season.  God bless you. 
[02:34:00]  Are all the mics working now?  I don't think this mic is on.  Oh, gosh.  I don't think any of these mics are on.  Is my mic on?  Hold on.  I vaguely hear that one.  Why would they work?  Why would they?  Yeah, we'll just yell.  We're getting the fuck out of here.  Can we move that?  Yeah, right?  Can't have fucking mics that work for us.  Do you have a question for these guys before we...  No.  No.  Listen.  I overstepped my bounds.  I'll turn it back over to the real celebrities.  And I'll go fetch your stuff and do my menial tasks. 
[02:34:30]  I just wanted to say hello.  It's a pleasure to meet you guys.  Continued success.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  You're a fan, dude.  Yeah, ask me a question.  Who's got the biggest hog?  Jesus.  Jesus.  All right.  No, what you call hogs motorcycles, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What you think I was thinking?  On drugs.  That was clever.  All right, Ken.  Get him the fuck out of here.  Give me that because I'm going to use this and we're going to share it with you.  I got my mic's working.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  Okay, good, good.  You're okay? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, mine's working, too.  I don't think...  Is this one working?  I can hear you.  Yeah, you're on thumbs up for everybody now.  Perfect.  My problem when I watch the show is it's like it's everything I'm not.  Like I'm watching men do like real man things with motorcycles and I'm the fucking most incompetent,  non-coordinated...  You have to have somebody fill up your washer fluid in your car, right?  Dude, I'm just...  You can't even like lift the hood.  I can't comprehend the light.  Have you ever lifted the hood of your own car?  No, I don't lift the hood unless there's a clit under it.  I have no desire. 
[02:35:30]  No, I have not.  I don't think any of us work on our own cars.  I used to.  Yeah, right.  Back when I made a Baja bug out of a Volkswagen many years ago.  Got the saws all out, cut it up, put the fiberglass on there, the nice KC highlighters.  I used to get the J.C. Whitney catalog all the time.  And I used to do man stuff before I turned fag doing this goddamn radio show.  Your hands are soft.  Yeah, from counting money.  From counting money all your life, Mr. Hooper.  So you guys have a show. 
[02:36:00]  It's just basically about what you do in life anyway.  Like this is what you'd be doing even if you didn't have the show.  Yeah, on a wall camera.  Same.  Yeah, now how did they pick up on this?  Because obviously you guys have been doing this.  Someone just doesn't knock on your door and go, hey, you want to do this on TV?  No, basically...  Basically they did.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah, that's kind of how it happened.  I mean, they called us up.  I guess they had Jesse James on the West Coast and he had a Motorcycle Mania.  And it did really well.  So they were looking for an East Coast builder.  And there was a producer that worked with Discovery. 
[02:36:30]  He looked online, found us, and gave a call, said, do you want to do a show?  We said, sure.  And three days later they were filming at the shop.  That's lucky for them because, you know, to get guys with personalities is pretty rough.  You think you could find guys that work on bikes that are just dull, you know?  You guys kind of keep it exciting and stuff.  I mean, when you unload on the boys, I have to turn away.  It brings up just bad memories. 
[02:37:00]  It's just like my dad's yelling at me.  No, that's why I watch.  I watch.  You like the yelling?  Just like I watch NASCAR, I'm convinced that it's going to happen.  Have you guys ever fought?  Physically?  Yeah.  No.  Never?  No, man, no.  Not as far as you know.  Yeah, not as far as you know.  You can't go there.  Although, you know, a lot of guys reach an age where they realize that they could kick their  dad's ass, but you don't do it.  They haven't reached that age.  I don't think so, no.  You might have a little trouble there.  I think that's a problem. 
[02:37:30]  That's a real problem.  There's usually somebody to cut it off, you know?  Yeah.  There's people around where when it gets too crazy, it gets cut off.  That amazes me that you guys haven't, like, you know, had an altercation.  You know what?  This has been going on since, you know, I had the steel business before this.  These guys were working for me when they were 12 years old, you know?  Yeah.  So, it's been going on for, it wasn't any different there neither, you know?  It's the norm.  It wasn't just bikes.  You were doing, like, what, commercial work?  No, I used to do steel fabrication, you know, buildings, putting up Home Depots and anything 
[02:38:00]  to do with structural steel, and my son Dan runs that company today.  Oh, so you still have that?  Yeah, I still have it, yeah.  And then, how'd you get into the bikes?  You know, I got into the bikes in the early 70s with my first partner.  He was a real bike guy from the city, you know?  And we started out in business together, and he, like, built a bike, you know, the frame,  and the whole, you know, he really did the whole deal, you know what I mean?  So, I was kind of with him when he was doing all that stuff, so that's what really got 
[02:38:30]  my interest, and then, in 1974, I bought my first Harley, and I still have it.  You've got to be surprised by how, like, massive the shop, I mean, these guys are, like, really  famous dudes, like, this is nowhere in the country we can go.  Oh, yeah, you guys get recognized everywhere, right?  Yeah, no, we're actually in 160 countries.  What?  Yeah, 160 countries, yeah, and it's popular in every country.  Unfortunately, most of our fans are male.  Wow, we have that same problem.  Yeah, we definitely relate to the sausage fest.  Right.  Isn't it something, you go to a signing or something, and it's like, wow, a girl, holy 
[02:39:00]  shit, spend some time with us, please?  Even though you're 400 pounds, we'll at least talk to you.  We're not gay when we do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the same problem we have.  It's never, like, hot chicks that love us, watching Dane cook.  So, before the show, did you make things as extravagant as you do now, or, you know, TV's  really kicked it up?  Actually, he did.  He, when we first started the business, and it was down, we just opened up a little building  downstairs from my steel shop, and we were going to just do it on a small level, and 
[02:39:30]  he came, he used to run the railing shop, and then when he came aboard with me to do some  of the fabrication, he kind of decided to do a Spider-Man bike, and that was the first  theme bike that was ever done, and that was, like, even before TV, that was, like, the  hugest thing out, you know?  That was, like, a year and a half before the show.  Got a lot of attention.  Yeah, it kind of helped spark that whole thing, and then the theme thing just stuck, and with  the show, it works out perfect, you know? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, because you could always come up with some other thing.  Yeah, because you're always, you know, it's always, you're always doing something different,  you know?  People identify with stuff like that, you know?  Yeah.  You make so many bikes, where do they go?  Like, what do you do?  We probably have 90% of them.  Yeah.  The big corporations keep theirs, they'll auction them off for their charity or whatever,  and then, you know, a lot of the bikes we do for, like, the 911 bike, the firing bike,  we keep that.  Right.  P.O.W. bike, all those bikes we keep.  Yeah, people come to the shop.  We got bus tours that come to our store. 
[02:40:30]  Let's have a huge showroom, like a museum.  Right now, we're in the process of building a 100,000-square-foot building, right by the New  York State Thruway, and then we'll have, you know, now we have a store, and then we have  the shops separately, so we're going to, everything will be under one roof, and, you know, basically  people, we have people there by the 100, it's all, a lot, you know what I mean?  They wait outside all day, and they'll be able to come inside now, and we'll have, like,  a one-way glass where they could actually look in and watch us filming, you know? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  There's a lot of families, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a big family thing, you know?  Yeah, it's definitely a family thing.  Yeah.  How much do the bikes go for?  Start at $40,000.  Yeah, start at $40,000.  Wow.  What's the most expensive bike you guys sold?  Uh, real expensive.  Yeah.  You're the IRS.  $41,000.  $41,000.  I guess you don't want to admit to that, but that's an interesting question, though.  Well, you know, it depends, because we do bikes for corporations, you know, so there's 
[02:41:30]  a whole package with it, you know?  We do a lot of corporate bikes, on and off air, and it works out good.  Like Lincoln, stuff like that, you know?  Yeah, because they get what they're looking for, and, you know, we get paid.  And they take them out on their promotional tours, and they're like that.  Yeah, yeah.  And we do appearances, you know, and stuff like that.  You know how it is.  It's not only just a bike, but, you know, sometimes in the deal, they get limited use  of our, you know, logo, name and likeness, you know, things like that.  It's like a cross-promotional or endorsement type thing.  We just came out with a, and it'll be, the Caddyshack show is next. 
[02:42:00]  They did the first one.  It was on Monday.  It was awesome.  It was on Monday.  With Bill Murray.  We had Bill Murray.  He's just incredibly cool.  And then we have, what else is, what's the next one after that?  Lugs.  Lugs.  You know, the boot company?  Yeah, boot company.  What makes it a Caddyshack bike without giving away the episode or whatever?  Well, we didn't really.  Because a lot of people haven't seen it yet.  You know, we started out like golf course, and it was like cheesy, because like golf course,  you know, you put flags on it, whatever.  And then we decided to do a Carl Spackler bike. 
[02:42:30]  Way better, you know?  Kind of just a torn up, tarnished, you know, kind of around the course type bike.  Something you might take around to go, you know.  Go for hunting.  Go for his thing.  But like the last show of the third season, we built a, you know, we always did like one-off  bikes, and we just did a bike that he designed, and it'll be, you'll see the whole process  of it, because we do everything in-house now.  We build the frames in-house.  We really have real high technology now and the machinery to do it. 
[02:43:00]  So we built a bike that will, it'll be distributed to a dealer network, which is something that  we've never done before.  And they're going to be available, you know, anywhere, you know, and, you know, certain  dealers will be able to carry the bike.  They're going to reproduce it, and we are.  Yeah, we're going to, I want to say mass, but we're looking at, I think, starting by doing  a hundred, which is a lot for us.  We do about 125 bikes a year.  So we're just about double our productivity, you know? 
[02:43:30]  Ah, the phone's just lit.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Titles, love the show, man.  Can't wait for the next season coming up.  I've got a question for you, though.  Are any of the guys in the shop fans of ONA?  Because I could swear in the old shop I saw a wow sticker up on the wall somewhere.  Yes, as a matter of fact, our computer nerds, Eric and Storm, are here.  Of course it would be the nerds.  Of course it would be the nerds.  What is his, Emperor Storm, a.k.a. Mr. Roboto. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  And Eric the Buttnut.  There you go.  Let's go to him.  So if you guys could, say hello to them.  Hello, boys.  Hey, guys.  How it is to be sitting here with your dad, like, you're talking about, like, seasons and  all this stuff.  Like, you had no show business aspirations, right?  No.  You guys were just, like, hanging out and just, you know, working with your father.  Mikey used to do, film himself when he was younger.  He would do, like, cooking skits.  Like, what the hell was that?  Yeah, he did this little skits and stuff.  Who was that?  Cooking stuff?  Yeah, who was that?  Childs, something child. 
[02:44:30]  What was the skater one we did, like?  We did an Antti Kerrigan thing.  Yeah, where he fell down the stairs.  Paul, you hit him and he went down the stairs and was holding his knee on skates.  It was lots of fun.  Yeah, if you're, you know, a couple of clowns with a camcorder, you're always going to just  goof around with it.  Yeah, exactly.  I used to do the same thing, yeah.  Yeah, and then, but, you know, to be approached and do real television, that must have been  a little odd from just coming from construction and then motorcycles.  It was shocking, you know?  Yeah, it was.  It was, like, shocking, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  166 countries.  Yeah.  You want to know the funniest thing?  We had a conversation when Jesse James came out with his show.  It was probably a year before we got our show.  And we actually had a conversation about how no one would ever want to watch us doing what  we do.  Like, how flat.  You know what I mean?  Like, we had nothing exciting, because he was all, like, you know, tough and flashy.  Yeah, he had, like, tattoos, and he, like, had pit bulls and shark tanks.  We were like, man, nobody's going to want to watch us.  He got a welder.  Even if it ever did happen, it wouldn't be any good.  Father and son, how boring. 
[02:45:30]  And then, yeah, see where it gets you.  What's the hardest part of, is it the design, the actual construction?  Have you ever gotten halfway through a project and you go, oh, boy, this stinks?  The hardest part for me is getting up in the morning.  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  What time?  Jeez.  If I want to get in on time, I've got to get up at six.  This is how dumb I am.  I actually am thinking, and they all, like, live together and just wake up and they're  there.  I'm at 30 years old.  But I honestly got what you think, get in there. 
[02:46:00]  There would be real fist fights then.  I don't know why would I think that.  What an ass.  You are an idiot.  Hey, let's go back to the phones here.  DJ in Atlanta.  DJ.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, man, thanks.  Hey, I got a question for OCC boys.  I got a buddy that met Junior once at one of the bikes stops.  And he'd asked if y'all really fought like that in real life.  And the answer was no, that y'all just basically do it for the TV.  I just kind of wanted verification on that. 
[02:46:30]  No, that's absolutely great.  I mean, I think anybody.  You would be a great actor then.  Anybody could figure it out.  You know what I mean?  We must be really good actors.  Yeah.  The original.  There's no script to our show.  Yeah, you could tell the authentic anger.  Yeah, no script.  That was the original appeal of the show because nobody knew who these guys were.  You remember the big white mustache, the tattoos, and him screaming at somebody.  And you're like, how do you not watch this?  You know, I honestly believe today that we're still the only real reality show on TV.  I don't think that most of those shows have a little bit of script to them. 
[02:47:00]  We have none.  You know what, too?  I mean, we even got great guys.  I mean, you'd think we hired Vinny just to be a character on the show, the way the show plays.  I mean, great, you know, Jason Poole.  We got all these great guys.  I mean, they just came along due to necessity of growth in the company.  And, you know, if you work out on TV, it's great.  If they don't, well, then they're, you know, serving a purpose for the company.  But we just get this mix.  I mean, you've got these quiet guys and funny guys.  I mean, you've just got such a mix of personalities. 
[02:47:30]  It just works, you know.  Let's go to Bill in Minnesota.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  Huge, huge fans.  I was just thinking while I was on hold, you guys could make an XM bike, but then it would be the first bike that never worked.  Way to hurt a nice feeling, sir.  Way to.  Yeah.  See, like I said, I'm a huge fan, and I finally reached a point in my life I could afford one of these things.  I'm dead serious here.  I'd like to have one made.  How do I go about it?  I mean, do you guys do anything with the general public?  I'm custom-making stuff. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, no doubt.  Just send us a check, a million-dollar check, paid out to cash, and we'll get to it.  No, actually, when you call the shop, we have a guy named Mike Burkhouse and Tommy Joyce.  They handle all that.  And we do a lot of – people think that we're unreachable, you know what I mean?  But that's not – it's really not the case.  We do tons of bikes for people, you know, regular guys off the street, blue-collar guys, you know what I mean?  We do a lot of bikes just for the average people, you know what I mean?  Yeah, I mean, you can get a bike from us just like any of the other builders, and really, we're priced lower than a lot of them. 
[02:48:30]  So we're not unobtainable as far as bikes go, you know?  Well, I'll definitely, definitely call.  And I did have a chance to shake Paul Sr.'s hand about a year ago, and you guys have not had a chance to.  This guy's got some b-hooks on him.  Yeah.  Look, I can't stop.  He has a dog tattooed its actual size.  He's a big dog, though.  When is the last time where it hasn't been that – when you really belted somebody?  No, geez. 
[02:49:00]  Long time.  Long time, yeah.  Those arms are really – I would just – I wouldn't want to be slapped.  You wouldn't even have to hit people.  You should just slap people.  That's what I would do.  I slap Mikey every once in a while, right?  I get slapped.  You get slapped around a little bit?  I deserve it.  I'm pleasant.  Let's go to –  I was passed over.  I'm smart.  Let's go to Tony.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, I was wondering, why aren't you guys out in Sturgis right now?  You know what?  Because we're filming, and the filming takes up a lot of our time, and, you know, we're on a schedule, 
[02:49:30]  so it gets harder and harder to make it to these events, you know?  And, honestly, we kind of miss doing that, you know, but it's too demanding, you know?  Yeah, but plus we're doing the OCC in America tour.  We kind of got these different locations.  The first one we did in Tempe.  Just recently we did Spokane, Washington.  The next one is –  What is it?  Nashville, Tennessee.  Nashville, Tennessee.  And then we're doing – 
[02:50:00]  Austin, Texas.  Austin, Texas.  Do you kind of miss the fact that you used to be able to go to these events and just be kind of the guys that are hanging out?  Yeah.  And look at the bikes and walk around.  Yeah, we don't get to do that.  That's the little bit of what happened.  Now, you guys, just insanity.  Especially at something like that where everybody knows exactly who you are, wants to meet you, wants an autograph.  They must love you.  Yeah, it's exciting.  I mean, these people are – you know, all these people who come to these events and come see us, that's why –  I mean, we wouldn't have a show if they weren't watching.  So, I mean, it's really due to them, but at the same time – 
[02:50:30]  They do miss anonymity.  Yeah, you miss – the only thing, the big thing that you lose is, you know, you don't have no privacy.  So it's part of the deal, you know?  The nice thing about the tour, like we do a tour, OCC in America tour, is that we do a live stage, a live show on stage,  and we actually build a bike on stage, and somebody wins it.  Yeah.  But the best part about that, there's – the audience feels like they're part of what you're doing.  Yeah.  When you sign autographs all day, sometimes we – you know, people wait in line six hours, you know, 
[02:51:00]  and to look at the top of your head.  So they don't really – you know, people get mad because they never get the opportunity to, you know, reach you.  So with the show, everybody's, like, feels like they're part of the show, and they are because we get them involved, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, we've had events where we draw 50,000, 60,000 people to an event, and there's no way you could –  they're all there to see you, and you can't see them.  So this way, we get up on stage, we do our thing, and, you know, I come out – 
[02:51:30]  the initiation is I come out with Jason, and we design a bike with the entire audience.  We've got this whole process, a big 25-foot screen, and we do the whole process like we do in the beginning of the show,  design the bike, and then we build it for them.  It's great.  I had no idea that was going on.  That's pretty cool.  Can we piggyback your success?  I want to find a way to latch on to their success with our dirty little claws.  Anthony, you're just the man to do it, Jim.  And your sister's on the line.  What does Dawny want? 
[02:52:00]  This is Aunt's sister, Dawn, yes.  Dawn.  Hey.  Hey.  I absolutely love these guys, so it's not just a guy thing.  Good, good.  Well, that's encouraging.  I think you love them for another reason, huh?  No, no, the show is awesome.  You like those big muscles.  Big biceps.  Biceps.  Well, that too, that too.  But I love watching, you know, another dysfunctional family.  It's great.  Yeah, yeah.  It makes everyone feel normal.  Yeah.  But I also wanted to know, what do you think about, like, you know, American Hot Rod came out after you guys, 
[02:52:30]  and I feel like there's a lot of these reality shows that are just trying to be scripted as dysfunctional.  You know, what do you think about that?  I think everybody and their brother has tried to copy us right out of the gate.  As soon as our success was there, boom, they came out with Southern Steel, I think, and they try to do it identical.  You know what I mean?  That's what TV does.  And, you know, the thing of it is that everybody failed.  Yeah.  You know what happened?  Everybody failed.  You know how it worked basically was our own Discovery Channel was basically doing that, 
[02:53:00]  and we were like, well, why are you going to do another American Hot Rod or, you know, something kicked off of our show?  But if they don't do it, someone, another channel's going to do it.  He's going to do it.  So they figure.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah, but they all go by the wayside because, you know, it's not authentic.  Listen, you can't recreate what we have.  It's just you could hire actors and everything, but it's just a natural.  And everybody's aware of that.  We're in talks to do a minibike show that's going to compete against you guys, so there you go.  I stopped on motorcycles when I was 15.  I was riding a moped, and, like, a queer, the mirror caught a parked car, and I fell and skinned my dummies. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, you guys are talking to the wrong guys because that happened to Jimmy.  I was on a minibike when I was 12 or 13.  I panicked.  I didn't know how to stop the thing.  Ended up in sticker bushes.  It's a legendary story.  My family had somewhere between 25 and 30 stitches all over my face and my head.  Never got on two wheels again.  I have a great minibike story, too.  I was riding around in Southern California on my minibike, and my pull starter snapped. 
[02:54:00]  So I took the cover off, and you know how you got the flywheel with the fan on it?  It's like the sharp fan.  I figured if I turned the bike around, now I'm facing front, and used my foot and just spun the wheel with my foot, it would kick over.  And it did.  But now the throttle's reversed.  So I think it's down because I'm facing the front of the bike, but it's gunned.  The thing spun around, and that sharp flywheel, now exposed, hit my shin, and just like, wham, I felt like I was shot in the leg. 
[02:54:30]  Dropped the bike, hobbled to the hospital where they stitched it up, came back, and it was gone.  And that was this.  The minibike was gone.  That was horrible.  Anthony, I remember that.  Listen, I got to go to work, but this was more exciting than talking to Ace Young from American Idol for me.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you.  That's saying something.  Bye, Dawn.  All right.  Bye, Dawn.  Bye.  Thanks.  Bye.  A little sister. 
[02:55:00]  Let's say hi to Anthony in New York.  Anthony.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up, guys?  I want to hear you guys rock.  I actually work for Paul Senor, feeding his horses, taking care of his horses.  You do?  You sound good and drunk.  Yeah.  I'm not doing it.  That works.  No, I just want to say Paul Senor's a nice guy.  Thank you.  I'm going to kiss his ass right now.  You're looking for a raise, are you?  He really scares me, so that's the only one.  I got nothing.  Wait, wait, wait.  Dude, what do you do with the horses? 
[02:55:30]  Like, when he puts them out to stud, are you the one that goes back with the bucket and gets  what they...  That's what it takes.  That's what I do.  So, whatever I got to do, that's what I do.  So, I get a little pleasure out of it.  The horse gets pleasure out of it.  You know, what the hell.  All right, buddy.  Hey, what was the worst idea you guys had for a bike and realized, oh, we can't do this.  This is stupid.  Gosh, we've had to do some that we didn't really want.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Can you name any of those?  No.  How about one...  Hey, we're excited to do this one.  How about one that you did, not that you didn't want to do, but that you probably wouldn't 
[02:56:00]  have thought to do yourself unless it was brought to you?  Yeah.  That's quite a few, bro.  I mean, you know, a lot of the corporate stuff, some of my favorite...  The My Little Pony bike?  Yeah.  You know, you get...  Yeah, it's tough.  I mean, people...  You know what we find a lot?  There's so many worthy causes out there.  Everybody, you know...  People get behind causes for one reason or another.  It affects their lives or whatever.  And, man, we just get a million requests for every kind of, you know, every kind of disease  and... 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Oh, the cancer.  I mean, just over and over and over.  You probably want to do that, but you goddamn...  You got to have an uplifting, fun show.  You can't just have disease bikes.  Yeah.  Not only...  All the time, you know?  Well, not only that.  I mean, you got to kind of pick some charities and stick with them and just kind of go that  direction.  You know, we do a lot with Make-A-Wish Foundation.  And that's awesome.  In the military, we do a lot.  Kids come down to the show.  Right.  Very cool.  Yeah, just, you know...  Would you guys build a lesbian bike?  I would.  Why not?  Yeah, why not, right? 
[02:57:00]  Hey, you...  The...  Just something over the top where everyone looking at home goes...  Wait a minute.  They're losing their mind.  What happened to these guys?  We'll wait until the ratings slip.  Yeah, right.  Right.  Sensational shows.  Yeah, right.  And we'll just dump it.  You leave the headlights the way they are and then you put a mullet on it.  You guys...  Who does the painting for you guys?  Nubbs.  Nubbs.  Man, is your artwork good on this one.  Nubbs are amazing.  So good.  He's Walden.  Yeah, he is good, man.  Nubbs is great.  How many of you are married?  I don't know.  I'm not that familiar. 
[02:57:30]  The one that's married is not here.  Dan.  Oh, you guys are all...  Okay.  Yeah.  So there's got to be some kind of like a chick input.  I mean, like there's got to be some kind of like getting laid jump up factor, especially  for you two.  Are you talking about groupies?  Yeah, man.  I mean, just from being that famous, because I'm thinking like even if a girl isn't a fan  of the show, she's walked in when her brother, her boyfriend was watching.  She knows who you are.  So that's got to be like fantastic.  You ever been up to like Unadilla?  Let me tell you.  You go wailing.  One in a million. 
[02:58:00]  You'll see a good one, but a bike gathering up there.  Man, a lot of flapjacks that you don't want to see going around.  All right, hold on.  This could be...  Something about the rumble of the bike effect on girls' breasts that just...  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  Flattens them out.  See, the fad are doing crank for three days in a row and they just fucking fall asleep.  Pass out on the floor.  This could get interesting.  We got a big fan of these guys on the line.  Okay.  Flavor Flav.  Oh, he's...  Flav.  Flavor Flav.  Yo, what's poppin'? 
[02:58:30]  What's poppin'?  Good morning.  Good morning, Flav.  Hey, Flav.  Good morning, guys.  How y'all doing?  O.P. Anthony.  What's poppin'?  What's up?  We're talking to the Orange County Chopper guys.  The Orange...  Yo, those are my boys.  What's up?  Orange County Chopper guys.  Yeah.  Flav say they still flies.  That's right.  Those are my boys, man.  You know, Flav, you should have them make a skank hoe bike for you.  One that drives logs out of his exhaust pipe. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, yo, listen.  If they were to ever make me a bike like that, I would ride it through the state of California  gracefully.  They got to make a ghetto bike.  Big clock on the front.  Right.  Hey, yo, how you guys doing?  All right.  How about yourself, Flav?  Doing all right?  Yeah, man.  Your man is doing more than better right now, man.  I mean, hey, man, we're the highest rated show on VH1.  I know.  Hey, we know all about it.  We were just talking about that. 
[02:59:30]  We were just talking about it on the way here.  On the way down.  Yeah.  All right, then we're all in on this one, man.  Yeah, we're on the way down here.  Our managers...  No, who brought it up?  Yeah, our manager did.  Yeah, our manager did.  What was it, like nine or something like that?  Yeah, you guys had some crazy rage.  Ridiculous.  It was the highest ever, right?  Yeah.  Ever.  On V...  What was it?  VH1?  VH1, Flavor of Love, Season 2.  You're the man.  Flav.  Yes, sir.  What a start to the second season.  We played all the audio yesterday and goofed on it.  We had a lot of fun.  Hey, man, I just want to thank all y'all, first of all, for watching me. 
[03:00:00]  I want to thank everybody that watched me, man, because if it wasn't for y'all, I wouldn't  be in this position.  Second of all, this is when I moved out to California for, to do TV and movies.  But accidentally, I didn't mean to become number one like this, but I wanted to be a number  one person all the time, you know?  Well, you did a great job, because when you start out a show with a woman shitting on  the floor, where are you going to go from there?  Honestly, you're going to go away from the house. 
[03:00:30]  That was hilarious.  Everyone started smelling something, and she crapped on the floor, picked it up, and ran  away before she could get caught, but the cameras caught her.  I'm going to tell you the truth.  I'm going to tell you all the truth, too, guys.  Yes, they did have to water it down for television, but you've got to see the unedited version.  It shows the doodle on the stairs and everything.  Is that like in the extras of the DVD, you can actually see the shit on the rug? 
[03:01:00]  No, not only that.  You can actually see six extra cameras catching her ass, picking that shit up off the floor.  You've got to send that to us.  Oh, my God, is that rank.  Did she, how come, like, she dropped the log on the, and picked it up and scooted away?  Did she drop it on the steps, too?  Yeah, that, yeah, the running steps was extra.  That was something that the dog couldn't hold.  Oh, it fell out.  She wasn't done yet.  So she, her hand, she was running up the stairs, and one more milk dud fell out.  Up the stairs, it was bloop, bloop, bloop. 
[03:01:30]  That's right, one milk dud fell out on the stairs while the other one was melting in her hands.  God, is that disgusting.  Hey, great start to the second season.  I'm really bummed that you kicked out the ghetto chick that beat up the white girl.  Hey, man, well, see, you know, I just had to, you know, let everybody know.  You know, I keep it real, you know.  You come in my crib, and you start in a fight or whatever, man.  If you throw the first punch, you've got to go.  She's a live wire, though, man.  She would have gave you some good TV. 
[03:02:00]  Hey, yo, she did give me good TV.  Did you see the prayer that she was doing?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Praying to God.  How are you going to pray to God and be cursing at the same time?  She's praying to God to give her the strength not to kick this girl's ass.  Wait, if you've got, like, 30 seconds, I can play that clip really fast.  I've got it right in front of me.  You've got to hear that.  Listen to this again from Flavor Love, episode one, season two.  After the big fight, the black girl is praying to God before she talks to Flav.  Please forgive me for any sins in which I committed, those I know and those I don't know, Lord. 
[03:02:30]  Lord, please forgive me for beating this bitch ass today, Lord.  Lord, please forgive me for thinking about beating her ass again, Lord.  Please rebuke all these demons that's in this house, Lord.  I pray unto you, Lord.  Is that really necessary?  Lord, you better quit interrupting my prayers before God direct me to whoop your ass.  God direct me.  Before God direct me to kick your ass.  Amen.  Flavor Flav.  Yeah, you're on to something, bro. 
[03:03:00]  I was just reading an article about you yesterday, and, man, you've had a hell of three or four years.  You were living with your mom on Long Island before all this hit?  Yeah, man.  You know, I went through a little something, man, back up in New York before I moved out to L.A.  Yeah, we read about it.  Well, he was living up in the Bronx with one of his chicks in a really small place and going nowhere fast,  and then you moved back home with your mom on Long Island, and then Hollywood came a-calling.  Yeah, man. 
[03:03:30]  Honestly, Hollywood came a-calling, and I came calling Hollywood.  Any wants and warrants, or can you visit New York again?  Huh?  Any wants and warrants, or are you allowed to visit New York again?  Oh, nah, man.  I always go back home, man.  Yeah, you cleared all that up?  Yeah, he was in the studio, so.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened to all the public enemy money?  You guys were tremendously successful.  I mean, there's still a little bit trickling around, but, hey, you know how that goes. 
[03:04:00]  He got into some hardcore stuff.  Oh, God.  You do realize also how people can kind of get their claws into things when you're new.  You guys get a good deal right from the start,  or did you have to get a little bit of power, and then kind of...  Oh, we got, you know, we got a really good deal.  We're probably going to be?  I know.  But he was just asking a question to the chopper guys there for you.  Yeah, because a lot of guys get screwed, and it sounds like a good idea at the time.  We were the example for everybody else what not to do.  Really? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  I mean, as far as licensing and all that stuff, you know, our licensing, we have 70 licensees,  and everything you see with Orange County Chopper's on it is ours.  Oh, that's great.  Good.  You didn't get into that.  From day one, we keep 100% of what's ours, and that turned out to be the brand.  So we've done well with them.  Because I'm sure they came across to you saying, hey, if you...  They wanted everything.  We told them we wouldn't do it.  Good.  So they gave us everything we wanted.  Hey, Flavor.  Smart.  Hey, yo, man.  You're talking to my L.A. chopper boys?  Yeah, we're talking to those guys, too. 
[03:05:00]  We're talking to you.  We're trying to make all this work.  Yo, could you tell my boys, though, Flavor sends a big up to them, man?  Those are my boys.  I love them, man.  They're hearing you.  They're hearing you.  Hey, Flavor.  Thanks, sir.  So another comment about the show, the white girl that is trying to act over-the-top ghetto.  How do you feel about that?  Honestly, to tell you the truth, the only thing I can say is, hey, if you don't be yourself,  then you get caught out there, and then you'll end up being yourself.  Trust me.  Y'all got to watch the show.  You know what I'm saying?  I ain't going to lie, but it kind of flipped me out a little bit, man, when I heard the 
[03:05:30]  girl's accent leak.  Oh, no, I can't say too much.  Yeah, you can, man.  Well, anyway, one day her accent left me.  I never took gymnastics, but I started flipping, and I'm like, oh, so you really ain't country  at all.  He's got a way of words.  And how's the bowling game?  Something happened on TV, and that girl started talking straighter than the arrow, and I'm  like, hey, what happened to the country accent? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  I got you.  Oh, good.  Very good.  Well, anyway, but bowling, yeah, that's going to be bowling like 210, you know what I'm  saying, 185, 210, and stuff.  Why?  Who want to come on a bowling alley with me?  Well, I was reading this article on you yesterday.  It's just a coincidence.  I was going through some magazines, and you were bragging about your bowling skills, and  the interviewer went to a lane with you, and the first ball was a gutter ball.  The second ball, you hit one pin.  And I'm like, this is right after he's bragging about his skills. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, yo, let me tell you all the truth, man.  Honestly, you know, I was kind of celebrating that.  A little twisted.  A little bit of Hennessy and Coca-Cola, man, so you know you're going to throw a couple  of gunner balls, but I came back around and kicked everybody's butt anyway.  Yeah, they discussed it on the article about how you're off all the hard stuff, but you  have, you know, no problem doing the Hennessy and a blunt every once in a while, and you  can keep yourself under control.  You've picked your own lifestyle there.  Oh, man, let me tell you something, man.  Nobody's life is squeaky clean, but I'm just going to do what works for Flavor Flays, 
[03:07:00]  man.  There you go.  Well, you're an honest and open guy there.  And you're doing well.  When can we catch the show?  When is that on?  Jesus, every hour on VH1.  Every hour.  Every hour.  Yo, I'm going to tell you, man, right now, man, yeah, I'm clicking butt on TV, and if  it wasn't for y'all watching me, I would not be in this position, man.  I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart, for real.  I got to ask really fast, so they do all the clips on what we can look forward to in this  season, and I heard what sounded like New York's voice. 
[03:07:30]  Please tell me she comes back a little bit here.  Honestly, can I tell you all the truth?  I do have a very, very special guest that comes back to my show.  Yeah.  Like you did on my first show.  Yeah.  I just can't reveal who your special, special guest is right now.  Yeah, I understand.  I was just trying to trick you.  I get it.  Hey, before we let you go, the question everyone's asking on the instant feedback and the phones  and stuff, what happened with Hoops? 
[03:08:00]  Hoops was the girl, obviously, he picked from the first season.  What happened with her?  Honestly, I like Hoops.  She's a real good girl and everything.  Lesbian.  What?  The chemistry wasn't for me.  Lesbian.  You know what I'm saying?  So what I did, I took the H off her name, and that's what I called the situation.  Oops.  All right.  We got you.  I think you saw a second season and said, I got to get rid of this bitch.  Your flavor, flavor, flavor is not dumb. 
[03:08:30]  Y'all too much, man.  I love you guys, man, because y'all keep it 100.  When you're in New York, you got to visit us, all right?  I promise you I will, man.  You guys, take care.  Have a good remainder of the day.  Thank y'all for watching me on the show.  And yo, L.A.  Choppers.  I love y'all, man.  I'll be down.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  Thanks, Dave.  Thanks, Dave.  He's gone.  All right.  He's probably tipping the Heinegan's a little bit.  Yeah, maybe he's walking too.  He's only on like 3,000 miles. 
[03:09:00]  We did a few VH1 things, and he was there.  When they had that reality show.  Big in 04 and the Big in 05 awards.  Oh, he's out there, man.  Yeah, out there, yeah.  Do you think it's because he thinks Orange County, and he's thinking like California?  He's probably thinking like, yeah.  He may, but he's a big fan, and he's like, when he sees me, he really lights up.  Yeah.  Right on.  He's a cool guy.  All right.  We have to take a break, so we should get the big plug-in for you guys as well. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  So we got the Caddyshack episode didn't air yet, right?  No, it did.  Oh, it didn't.  Part two.  Other than part two, that's where I got confused.  That's going to be the finish of the bike, and us golfing.  You get to see him hacking up a course with Bill Murray.  It's going to be good.  That must have been fun.  You got to golf with Bill Murray?  Yeah.  I would love it.  And his brothers, actually, Brian Doyle.  They're pretty good, right?  Yeah, no, good.  Good.  Real good.  Real good, huh?  Yeah.  It was fun.  Them guys are good, man.  Yeah.  I mean, they're just like, you know, regular brothers that, you know, drink and punch each 
[03:10:00]  other in your face.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  What, they rag you pretty bad?  No, it was good, man.  No, no.  Good to hang out with, man.  Yeah, real nice.  Bill Murray is so funny, naturally funny, not over the top, just very funny all the time.  All right.  That's something.  I'm going to have tucked in your memory.  No kidding.  All right.  It's Orange County Choppers, Mondays at 10 p.m. on the Discovery Channel.  Season four, right?  Still a couple more for season three, and then in January we start. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, January?  Okay.  January we'll start season four.  This was a pleasure, guys.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks for having us.  Thanks for having us.  Mikey.  Cool meeting you guys.  All right.  Good luck with the show, man.  Thanks.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  It's great.  I like to have those guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's really nice.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night.

When's very, very soon?  Wow.  Very soon would be, like, further away than very, very soon.  Very, very soon is sooner than very soon.  But there's one frame of it on opianathony.com. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, Jesus.  You are making people angry with your eating like that.  I'm hungry.  I'm hungry.  I'm hungry.  I'm hungry.  All right.  We're trying to find this thing they did in the post today.  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire everywhere.  Stars are blind and deaf.  Paris Hilton, whose day job mostly comprises penniless flashing of paparazzi, already makes 
[03:12:30]  our eyes bleed several nights a week via The Simple Life.  Now she's, after our ears, flooding radio station airwaves with her baby talk singer-sync song  reggae-like songs like Stars Are Blind.  Yeah, they can make anyone into a singing star.  A pop star.  A pop star.  I'm Paris Hilton, so you've got some kind of stupid built-in audience.  I don't know why.  Well, you've got the right people around you. 
[03:13:00]  You can make anyone sound good in the studio, and you can throw it on the radio, and you  can get away with it.  For a song or two, anyway.  Paris Hilton.  She's good.  It's off the album Paris.  Genre?  Homemade porn soundtrack.  Mm-hmm.  How they did it?  I always wanted to record an album, but I was just too scared.  Oh, why they did it?  Oh.  Who knows?  Hard to sing with a cock in your mouth?  Highlight.  Her boob falling out while filming the video for Stars Are Blind. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  So you catch a little side of her boob instead of just watching the video while she's sucking  cock and getting fucked doggy style?  Video's great.  Sounds like heavily layered tinny pop vocals.  I disagree.  Fire, fire, fire.  Sorry.  I heard it, and I thought she was wonderful.  Did you?  You liked it?  Wonderful.  I laughed.  I cried.  She's good. 
[03:14:00]  The kid's good.  Well, you want to hear a little taste of that?  Sure.  I want to hear all of it.  Hear a taste of that.  Interesting.  Paris Hilton.  Stars Are Blind.  You want to touch a side of that?  Another sense joke.  It is a little ragah.  Yeah.  It's got a little ragah to it.  How do you not dance?  Sign it.  I don't mind spending some time just hanging here with you, cause I don't find too many guys 
[03:14:30]  that treat me like you do.  Those are the guys that want to take me for a ride.  It's on key.  I'll give her that.  That's refreshing.  It's not all.  It's probably been so touched up in there.  Yeah.  It's not awful.  It's just, it's a harmless, irrelevant piece of nonsense.  But it's not her talent.  No.  It's a producer in a studio making her sound good. 
[03:15:00]  If she's even singing.  Yeah, I know.  That's true.  Don't forget Milli Vanilli.  Can we?  I had until you brought their name up, dammit.  Hey, I want to do a song.  Can we modulate my voice?  Is there a way to make someone's voice sound good?  Yeah.  I'm going to work on a tone.  I'm going to show you that can be done.  You know something?  A lot of things they could do to music these days and vocals and everything, but it is 
[03:15:30]  still very hard to make someone that sings off key sound on key.  I know they got pitch transposers and correction and stuff, but it's very hard to get somebody  that sings badly off key to sound on key.  Well, I'm good.  Rich is stating the obvious here.  Rich.  Morning, buh, buh, buh, buh, boys.  Hey, Rich.  Rich.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Guys, somebody needs to call Gwen Stefani and let them, or call the police and let them  know that she done stole her voice.  That's totally sounding like Gwen Stefani to me.  That's something like Gwen with emphysema, maybe. 
[03:16:00]  At least Gwen Stefani's got like a little power to her voice.  Hey, with some nasal problems.  That was awful.  She's got some allergies.  Punching out, boys.  Take it easy.  She's sticking up for Gwen.  I noticed that.  Look at me.  She's seen her in concert eight times.  Yeah, probably eight times.  You think the chopper guys noticed that we were a bunch of wimps?  Yeah.  As soon as they heard what the show they were doing.  God.  We stink.  When they all had sex with Jimmy as we watched. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I yelled help and you went, we are.  We're helping ourselves to some lubricant.  I think they might have thought wimp.  Speaking of help, help yourself to a balloon, Don.  Joey.  Yeah.  Turn your radio down.  Stop listening.  Shit.  Turn it down.  It's down.  It's down.  All right.  I would have hung up on you, but I need you for a segue.  Let's go.  Holy shit.  Turned his phone down.  Holy shit. 
[03:17:00]  Dude, talk now.  We didn't say turn your brain power down.  Oh, he bailed out.  Good, stupid.  He didn't bail out.  He hit the ground.  He said that was the worst song ever.  Oh, thank God.  And the post has a whole article on stars singing really bad songs.  Yep.  And there's a couple more examples here.  We want to just play to that.  My favorite is the next one.  I don't know why they don't like this one.  Oh, this one's good.  Did you like it when it came out?  Who didn't?  Who didn't?  It was a party anthem.  This was ridiculous when it came out.  We talked about all our girls.  We all understood.  Why don't we play it? 
[03:17:30]  See, already.  I'm feeling good already.  I challenge your thoughts.  I like that.  Tap.  And in the video, in the studio, and you saw him clap.  Yeah, would he?  Yeah.  He was so serious doing this.  Well, he had Rick James behind him for this song.  Yep.  He did three albums?  Eddie Murphy?  He wanted to be Michael Jackson, like, really bad.  Michael Jackson was really, like, cool shit back then.  Yeah.  How could it be? 
[03:18:00]  From Danny.  This is great.  Yeah, it's jazzy.  See the high hair?  Yeah.  Shoulder pads on the girls?  Yeah.  This is wonderful.  Free hands.  What they thought the future would look like.  With their stupid clothes.  Why you gonna hurt me?  Hurt me.  After all of the things I've done for you.  Ooh, good point, Ed. 
[03:18:30]  Good, Eddie.  I'll buy you separate trousers.  Put down and throw your finger.  All right, that's a take, Davey.  I don't like to want to party all the time to do.  My girl wants to party all the time.  Does she?  Does she?  All the time.  My girl wants to party all the time.  All the time.  And I related to that because I once dated a girl that would always party all the time. 
[03:19:00]  Give her a number to every boy she saw.  Or just some of the time.  I wrote a song about her.  It was called Cunt.  Speaking of music, we got Coke Logic on the phone.  Coke Logic.  Hey, what's up, boys?  I want to hear some real music.  I want to hear Foundry.  Oh, yeah.  Where is that fucking...  You know, this is good because Steve C., a celebrity in his own right. 
[03:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  And...  As we get Steve C. in studio with his music.  He's got his music.  Androgynous zilch in here.  You know, we don't have...  God, we don't have one of our favorites that they talked about in the New York Post today.  Joe Pesci doing Wise Guy.  The Wise Guy rap.  Oh, or the Bitches That'll Gitches.  Oh, that's just...  It's the Bitches That'll Gitches.  How about Rodney, huh?  You got the Joe Pesci?  Hey, huh.  N-Rock singing?  Shake it a baby!  Rapping Rodney?  Whoa. 
[03:20:00]  Dropped something.  What fell there?  That could have really hurt somebody.  Could have hurt your foot with a foot.  Foot thing.  Foot thing on your foot.  Ah, Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Oh, this was a little bit of it.  Hold on.  Joey, Joe Pesci.  It's a Bitches That'll Gitches.  Is it, Joe?  Oh.  It's a Bitches That'll Gitches.  Just looped?  Bitches That'll Gitches.  It's a Bitches That'll Gitches.  He did a whole rap, like, in between.  This was, like, the hook.  It's a Bitches That'll Gitches. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  The Bitches That'll Gitches.  Thanks.  Bitches.  Gitches.  Love it.  It was, like, get all of you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Bitches That'll Gitches.  The Bitches That'll Gitches.  Yeah, he's right.  Bitches.  Is he right?  Steve, where's your music?  Yeah.  Here it comes.  He goes right here.  Oh, he looks so sad and rejected.  Oh, come on.  Foundry.  No energy.  He's like, oh, it's right here.  Where is it?  Give me that CD.  Yeah.  Before he thinks about taking it back. 
[03:21:00]  No, I can't take it back.  I want to enjoy the whole CD.  Give it to me.  Ugh.  The cover art.  All right.  The cover art.  The name of the CD you guys put out was What Kills Me?  That's right.  Our own Steve.  Very aggressive.  And you were the singer?  Uh-huh.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  I'm never talking to you again, Jimmy.  Did you?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Did you hand this CD to Ant and I when we were working at AAF?  I might have.  I think I, uh... 
[03:21:30]  There's a problem.  I'm calling a group called Foundry.  It was very hard to find and navigate.  Come here.  Oh, oh, oh.  I probably did because I used to work those beach parties that you guys did at, uh, what  was that, Fitchburg Center?  Fitchburg.  Whatever that stupid indoor hockey arena was where you guys...  Oh, the indoor beach party in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.  Because I would work security at those things.  Where's all the other guys with Mullis?  Could you just give this a listen?  I guarantee you, Steve right now is secretly hoping that there's a big talent scout listening.  No, I'm not. 
[03:22:00]  Who will recognize that Foundry was a band that was overlooked.  Trust me.  I've heard enough, I've heard enough, uh, demo CDs and befriended enough of the guys  that I grew up listening to to know that this is not going to be.  Isn't it exciting, though, when you finally get the package in your hand and you're a band  and you're like, here it is, man.  Oh.  It's going to make it, man.  You guys all listen and tap your toes.  At the time, ten years ago, yeah, you're ecstatic.  You're like, wow.  Guys.  No.  You guys weren't looking at this closely.  Oh, no.  What?  I'm bummed that you guys don't have thank yous. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, those are always fun.  I thought we did.  But, Steve, would you like to let everyone know what your rock name was?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Stephen Carr.  That's right.  Ooh.  Let me clarify one thing.  Oh, boy.  I forgot about that.  If I find out, if you spelled it C-A-R-R, I'm going to smash omnis into your face.  Yes, I did.  Fucking cocks.  Grr.  Grr. 
[03:23:00]  Steve hybrid it is now.  Steve Carr.  Let me try to start myself.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm out of gas.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is Steve Carr on vocals.  I forgot about that.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Was Steve Douche taken?  Everybody in the band had, like, a very antiseptic, cool-ass name, and I was the one guinea in the group.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  I had to fit in. 
[03:23:30]  Carr, yeah.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Fucking horrendous.  Better than Steve Lisey.  Exactly.  Steve Lisey or Steve Carr.  Good name, you're, it's, oh, good name, you're, I lisey my, hold on, I gotta tell myself, it was a good one, too, you bastard.  Steve Carr.  I wish I would have seen that, I didn't get it.  Well, there it is, right there.  C-A-R-R.  R-R.  Boundary is Steve and Carr, lead vocals and guitar. 
[03:24:00]  Steve and Carr.  I bet you're a dummy.  Steve and Carr.  I got this his autograph, Steve.  Yeah.  Oh, I did.  I used to.  And the last two R's trailed off.  Ah.  No, the T used to intersect every other letter, I think.  Yeah, it was awful.  Steve Carr.  Carr.  That was close.  Steve Carr.  Grr.  Steve Carr.  Carr.  Thank you, sweetie.  Oh.  No, I don't want to write in that.  Oh, let's see your autograph.  Come on, Steve Carr.  Oh, back there?  We should do old-time concert commercials for Foundry. 
[03:24:30]  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Featuring Steve Carr.  Carr.  Carr.  Carr.  How many times did you rehearse the speech at the Grammys?  They normally don't recognize this kind of music.  You know, dribble.  I'm sure I had those conversations with myself, like, you know, in the shower or at night.  How would I win that Grammy?  Large boy.  Yeah, all 400 pounds of me.  All right, Steve.  Imagining, like, Jeopardy, having a question, like, this lead singer of a popular band is 
[03:25:00]  actually named Steve Carr-Lisi.  And everyone knows it.  Who is Steve Carr?  Steve Carr is correct.  That's right.  Yes, Steve Carr.  This band actually put out one CD, and it sucks a bag of ass.  Whose bag of ass?  Wow.  This was everything to this guy back in 97.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what song should we play?  Steve Carr should have gone to the junkyard to be crushed. 
[03:25:30]  Steve Carr should have carried Harry Chapman on his back.  Steve Carr should have baby seats in the back backing into a lake.  Steve Carr should have a hose taped to the side of his face.  Oh, it's really awful.  Steven Carr.  Steve Carr.  I used to wear these awful get-ups with, uh, I had, since I was so big, I couldn't buy  stage clothes in normal, I couldn't buy off the rack, so I was going to Lane Bryant, 
[03:26:00]  the fat woman shop.  Oh, my God.  The fat woman shop.  Steve Carr gets his clothes from me, Lane Bryant.  And we'll tell you more in this issue of Tiger Beat.  And I had this, uh, yes, indeed.  Oh, God damn.  How did this go so long?  How long have we known Steve?  I have kept this intentionally.  Eight years?  Very, yeah.  Eight years I've kept this muffled.  Oh, my God.  So you would go to Lane Bryant, and what would you buy for your crazy stage outfit?  A 3X leopard skin blouse. 
[03:26:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  I had that.  I had, uh, I had gold sequined Doc Martens.  I had, uh.  You're divine.  Yeah.  You are divine.  Yeah.  I think, I think I had, uh.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's more than terrible.  My girl wants to borrow my shirt all the time.  Steve Carr. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, you stink.  It was awful.  I had, I wore black eyeliner when I was, uh.  We got to blow up the lyrics, because they're really ridiculously tiny.  Oh, are there lyrics?  Why didn't I look at that?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're too, you're just not observant, Jimmy.  What kills me.  Wow.  Music by Stephen Carr.  Lyrics by Stephen Carr.  Ew, you were Stephen Carr?  Stephen Carr.  Like Stephen Tyler. 
[03:27:30]  Right.  It's hard to read.  It can't be Steve Carr.  Stephen Hawking Stephen King.  Did you think about it?  Should it be Steve Carr or Stephen Carr?  What was the big?  I probably did.  What was the big hit?  What kills me?  Uh, I'm trying to think.  Yeah, that was one.  The hit.  That was the hit.  I want to live.  I want to dream.  I want to fly.  I want to die.  I think there was one.  I think the one that was called Tell Your Story was the one that.  And by hit, we are just leaving the S off the front.  Yeah, exactly.  They're all crap.  Please love the lyrics so we can hear it. 
[03:28:00]  We can sing along.  And the course of my existence isn't yours to compromise.  I was written by.  I want to love.  I want to hate.  I want to punch a girl in her vagina.  I want to do promos that nobody gets.  I want to turn and deviate.  Play the hit Ramone.  Bring me a cloth.  A little taste.  What song do you want us to play?  You can play the first one.  That's fine.  Pendulum?  Yeah.  Pendulum.  They all have lost. 
[03:28:30]  As performed by Stephen Carr in the band Foundry.  Swings back and forth like a pair of balls when you're wearing a Lane Bryant dress.  It was a blouse, Jimmy.  A blouse.  A pencil.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Wow.  We're waiting for the lyrics to be blown up.  Okay.  We want to sing along.  Oh, people are just suggesting photoshops now that are just ridiculous. 
[03:29:00]  I kept this so under wraps for so long.  Ted Kennedy should drive you into Chappaquiddick.  Steve Carr crash.  Oh, man.  Strap in.  Yeah, just strap in.  I remember when I told Jimmy about this, he looked at me and he just was laughing.  I said, what are you laughing about?  He said, I'm just trying to decide if we're going to get one or three hours out of this. 
[03:29:30]  You knew it had to be.  You're getting thrown under the car.  What are the rest of the boys doing in the band?  I think one of them is still playing in bands in Boston.  The other guys all had day jobs, and that's what kept everybody in Boston.  I was just like, I don't want to do this anymore.  And I moved back to Jersey.  The scene in Boston was Godsmack and everybody else at that point.  I think Stained was just starting up at that point, too.  Godsmack and Foundry would be a good double bill. 
[03:30:00]  Sully and Stephen Carr posing for a magazine.  Stephen Carr.  If only.  That's what he wanted.  Yeah, that's what you want.  That's what you wanted, right?  At 22, that's what I wanted.  I thought I wanted to be a rock star, and then I came to the realization that everybody  You get copies for everybody?  Godsmack and Goddreck.  Here, Jimmy.  God, even blown up, the lyrics are beyond tiny.  Had to fit all of my creativity in a very small space.  Oh, we were broke.  We recorded this in two days in a, I think it was in Austin or something like that, some studio. 
[03:30:30]  Wow, here's a number that went undialed for bookings call.  What will that number get you now?  I have no idea.  It's probably residential.  We should call it and say, can we book a Foundry?  Is Stephen Carr there?  You know what?  You should send this down to Washington and get this on the Unsigned channel.  Oh, my God.  Stephen Carr.  You guys have the fucking worst names.  Stephen Carr, and then there's Alan Stratton.  Write that number down.  See if anyone answers, and if they want to, like, come on the radio. 
[03:31:00]  I guarantee what you're going to hear is it's going to be a voicemail.  Hi, this is Steve.  I can't come to the phone right now.  It's just his cell phone.  It's going to ring in his pocket.  It's going to ring on my hip.  Right.  All right, here's going to come to the lyrics.  So we're going to play Pendulum by Foundry?  That's right.  Oh, my God.  With Stephen Carr on his guitar.  Did somebody else there?  You guys ever play a show?  Yeah, a bunch.  Did you?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  I don't even get the first line.  What's the first line? 
[03:31:30]  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day.  Another condescension.  Oh, just another.  It says day.  Mock you, shock you.  Going to lock you down.  All right, wait a minute.  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  How does a pendulum swing?  Everyone's looking at it swing?  I guess, yeah.  All right.  Did you just look for things that rhymed?  No, I did have a rhyming dictionary. 
[03:32:00]  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow, and the pendulum will get you.  It's the pendulum that will get you.  Show you, mow you.  Going to throw you around.  Ew.  Show you, mow you.  Mow you.  How appropriate.  Maybe we shouldn't pay this place.  You didn't.  God, I can't take this picture of you, though.  It should have been Stephen as big as a.  Wait till you see line three.  This is where the writing gets good, Stephen.  Oh, okay.  Hindenburg. 
[03:32:30]  You did the crime, but not the time.  You went there, didn't you?  You did the crime.  Don't do the crime if you can do the time.  What was the crime you committed?  Impersonating a retarded person writing lyrics?  Now you've got to pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  My back is going to break if you push me in the rear.  Push it in my rear. 
[03:33:00]  If you push me one more time.  It doesn't even rhyme.  It does.  If you hear the rhyme scheme at all.  My back is going to break.  Exactly.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  I was 22.  It's like one of Jimmy's poems.  It really is.  You make me look like fucking mammoth.  No, I don't.  I wasn't a poet, but you get it.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  Got no choice in the matter. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Shaped like a bulldozer.  If you see me coming, put on certain glasses and you'll see me pass in front of the sun.  Holy shit.  Because the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Pendulum can take only so much yelling, but he'll do next.  What he'll do next?  What he'll do next?  There's no telling.  Like dog shit, this song is smelling.  Bump you, chump you, gonna dump you out. 
[03:34:00]  Pendulum will break under too much tension.  Breaking down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking ballin', kingdom falling down.  And that is all the words to Pendulum.  So now you can follow along at home with the actual music from the band Foundry, ladies and gentlemen.  Listen to the words.  Is there a little intro music?  Yeah, all of our songs had very long intros.  Very long intros.  Electric drum triggers. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, great.  What instrument did you play, Sweetie Pie?  Guitar.  Eric.  Oh, the man.  As that tiny little thing in front of me would indicate.  Oh, I see.  Blown up bigger, and so is Steve in this picture.  Wow, you are just a shell of your former self.  I am so proud to look at you now.  Thank you, Anthony.  When you were giant.  How much did you weigh back then?  16, 15.  Pushing 400.  I mean, at that point, who's counting?  I really was huge.  I'm like a 50-inch waist, I think.  All right.  Wow.  Pendulum.  Okay, good. 
[03:35:00]  All right, here we go.  Get ready to rock.  Cut off the top of Pendulum.  Here it is, people.  Foundry.  On the only station that really rocks.  This is Foundry.  Pendulum.  Featuring Stephen Carr on lead vocals and guitar.  Stephen Carr going to be joining us in studio later on.  All right, get on.  Talk about his new album.  This is Pendulum on the only station that really rocks. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is so good.  I repressed this.  Pendulum will cymbal in a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow and the Pendulum will get ya.  Showing you and lower you is gonna throw you around. 
[03:36:00]  Here it comes.  Which is a grindin' hot to time.  Now you gotta pay for what you've done, you better run.  That all I can take is while you're screaming in my ear.  Back is gonna break it.  Can't push me one more time.  Aye, aye, aye, aye.  My heart can't stand there.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I'm just getting cold.  Waitin' your secret's on and let's get out of my way. 
[03:36:30]  Can't.  The band's a lover's bringing back the other way.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Get the fuck out now.  Why not?  What are you doing in my house?  Get the fuck out.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  What are you doing in my house?  What are you doing in my house?  What are you doing in my house?  Let's go down.  Let a bump you and jump.  You're gonna jump you around. 
[03:37:00]  There's a little break.  I'm in too much tension.  I'm still squirking down the walls.  I'm watching tension.  When I get a ball and get a ball and down.  Steve can't take it man, he's tapping out 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, obligatory guitar, I forgot about that, yeah  Buried in reverb  Wild stallions 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, bring it down, every bad boy has a soft side  I just can't control, you see me coming, let's get out of my way  The pendulum is swinging back the other way  That's terrible, I'm sorry  No, no, no, no, no, no  You see me coming, let's get out of my way 
[03:38:30]  The pendulum is swinging back the other way  No, no, no, no, no, no  Take me into something, man, I'm just in control  Why not?  You see me coming, let's get out of my way  The pendulum is swinging back the other way  Durr, durr  Durr, durr  Durr, durr 
[03:39:00]  Durr, durr  Durr, durr, durr  There you go, foundry  Pendulum, I'm the only station that really rocks  You know what, it's not that bad  You gotta be honest with the guy, it's not that bad  It's not  No, it's not that good either  No, it's not that bad  We were hoping it was a lot worse, trust me  Let's see, well, the instant feedback doesn't think so  Yeah, I'm sure they don't  I'm sure they're full with 
[03:39:30]  He's a savage animal  Oh, yeah  He sings monotone too  I want to hear you sing something  Like what?  I sing jingles all the time, you've heard me sing this one  Steve from Philly  Is the singer a great big fat person?  No  He sounds like the announcers, the news announcer from South Park  Okay  Sing a little something I can tell, I know you can  Like what?  Who's fronting the band?  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il from Team America 
[03:40:00]  A lot of people have thrown in the South Park reference  Steve once bit the head off an ostrich on stage, is that true?  I got a question, I'm hungry enough  Do you got a slow one?  Yeah, but  Power Ballad?  No, no Power Ballad  No  But you slowed it down?  I slowed it down, I slowed it down on one track that I wrote for my sister  But I don't want to play that one  You can't play that one  Oh, alright  The honeypot is swinging back the other way  What other one do you want to play there, Steve? 
[03:40:30]  Let me see  Let me see the thing  I'm telling you, I haven't heard this in years  Quite intentionally  He makes them play at parties  My mother plays this at her house  And she's like, because she's so proud  She's like, my son did this  And I'm like, ma, turn it off  She couldn't be proud  She probably does that when people are going to eat and they shouldn't eat  She puts it on and it just wrecks their appetite  Oh, let's see  When you're all blocked up and you can't shit  They have this in the bathroom  She plays it when she wants to empty the house  Yeah, when she wants the company to leave  Yeah, the company needs to go home 
[03:41:00]  Mrs. T  Crank up some foundry  This is my son  Haven't heard anything like that since the song from Boogie Nights  In the studio  Hello  We look like assholes, man  I'm Stephen Carr  I'm trying to think which one has the more cliche lyrics  You can try five or seven  Let me see  Which one  Tell me the names of them  Yeah, because that might just be  He might be a one-hit wonder  Yeah  With Pendulum  Something tells me that  I'm spewing cliches left and right 
[03:41:30]  He was very  He was very confident with Pendulum  Yeah, he was  Play Pendulum  Tell Your Story or Burned  Those are  Burned  Let's look at the lyrics  What's it about  What should happen to these CDs?  Nothing  Who are you to force my hand?  I can barely understand  This battle that I'm going through  Is raging between me and you  I've got a feeling  That you keep me kneeling  When you see me coming  Don't run  This war has only begun  And you can tell your story to the man in the moon 
[03:42:00]  He's the only one listening to you  And you can plead your insanity until you turn blue  But he's the only one listening to you  The man in the moon  Funny how you speak your mind to the scum of humankind  The little bit I try to do is all I need to bury you  Ominous  Alright, someone read Burned  Where is it?  I'm afraid I can't get through  That was scary  Wasn't it?  Where's Burned?  I see it  There it is, sweetie  So take another piece of me 
[03:42:30]  If it takes you where you want to be  It seems you'll win at any cost  Because there's another friend you lost  Challenging observation, Stephen  You are  Stephen  Mondo talentless  I challenge you to not throw up  While these songs are playing  Sexy Stephen Carr  In his leopard print blouse  Raising the temperatures 
[03:43:00]  You were taking it all  But you still wanted more  And you never knew what hit you  Till they found you on the floor  Oh  When the hammer came down  You had your back turned  They should have told you  When you started the fire  You were gonna get burned  Wow, that stuck  And whoever got hit by that hammer  Can consider themselves lucky 
[03:43:30]  That their listening experience was over  And M. Boogie from upstate New York said  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking blouse  So do we try Burned?  Hold on, there's only a little bit more now  Alright, go ahead  Somewhere your life got left behind  Your avarice was on your mind  You say that money's all you need  Well, that's not wisdom 
[03:44:00]  That's just greed  Of course it is  You  If you wanna know if the rest of your band was  Brock Landers and Chess Rockwell  And if you cover the song  I'm a winner  So you take a  So take another look at you  You did just what I said you'd do  I guess you wanted any cost  Cause that's your only life you lost 
[03:44:30]  Wow, Steve, man  You know something?  I gotta give you credit  Cause this is really hard  This is not easy  Why?  I think Steve is secretly proud of this  Are you?  No, Camper  No  He's secretly a foundry  Ten years ago I was quite proud of this  But now in retrospect  There's a guy in the line  That actually liked the song we played  Cool  But first, Mike in New Orleans  Mike?  Well, I was wondering  I got two questions for Steve  One, I wanted to know  When he went to Lane Bryant  Did he get the brassieres to snap in the front  Or in the back?  And then my  One other question was 
[03:45:00]  Did he ever  When he was leaving the gig  Get approached by a guy  With a bad hand  Trying to help him get a chance  You're about to sign 300  Let's get a help over there  Someone who actually likes his  Yeah, let's go to Billy Smithtown  Then we'll get to that guy  Billy?  Yo  What's up, Billy?  What's going on, guys?  I wanted to know if I'm Steve's a writer  He requested a live barrel of salmon every night  A live what?  Barrel of salmon  Mondo stomachless  He has to have 
[03:45:30]  He has to have honey and salmon  And he won't do any gigs  Between October and May  Scott, you like the song, huh?  Yeah, it's not that bad  It'll be long, though  I think it was called  The Paisal on Fitzgerald  I put on a dress  Fellas, I'm too fat to feed you  Let's go to Tony in California  Tony  Hey, I was just wondering if anybody made the connection that not only was he dressed like a fat bitch, but he was singing about mood swings 
[03:46:00]  Yeah  Like a pendulum swings every month  I find myself spotting in my underpants  Tony in Texas, Tony  What's up?  Hey, man  I just wanted to tell Steven that music sounds pretty good  I want to know where I can get some more of it  Oh, well, is there any way this is available? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, the copy Ope has in his hand  That's it, huh?  Can you imagine that?  That's all, huh?  Can you imagine this all turns out to be a good thing for Steve?  Yeah  We're goofing and next thing you know, the band is back together  The great should be  North America  This one song became a hit and then Steve just died  Holy shit  Davey in New York City  Steve Carr Sick  Oh, the listeners are coming through 
[03:47:00]  Oh, Steve in the car  Oh  If you let Kiss into the Hall of Fame, you gotta have the Archies and Foundry, Fezzy  From Vanilla Thunder in Philly  Very good  Mondo Chartless  Mondo what?  Chartless  Chartless  Did Steve bite the heads off live halibut? 
[03:47:30]  During his sets  Pete from Connecticut  Where is Than the Piano Man?  That's tomorrow  Yeah  Yeah, Than would jam with him  That'd be a great little jam  Oh, man  You know this is leading towards the BAB tapes  You know that, right?  Mm-hmm  Yeah  Yeah  I heard, by the way, I was sent  The entire first show  Oh, you heard it?  Yeah  I used to have it here, but I think  Isn't it just awful? 
[03:48:00]  I used to have it here, but I think Anthony came here in the middle of the night  And took it  Well, now I have it  Because I don't have it anymore  And I don't have a sound clip thing, but I will put it on a recorder  And occasionally play it into my mic  Oh, boy  I just wanted to do a George Burns impression  What's all we playing?  You want to do Burn, Jimmy?  You want to hear that one?  I don't know  Fuck you, Jim Norton  Because I said something about this  And I just wanted to do  What was George Burns saying this?  Oh, George Burns singing  I was just doing my George Burns impression  I was cute  I know you were 
[03:48:30]  Shut up  This isn't about me  I know  I'm just saying that  This is about Steve  Please  Hey, everyone  Nothing to see here  Look over there in that direction  I know some George Burns singing  I wonder what it would sound like  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  What are you doing in my house?  What's my problem?  No  Can George Burns sing a pendulum?  Nothing's wrong  Get the fuck out  Now  That's terrible  I'm sorry  I can't hear you  What?  Grr  Grr  Grr  All right, now 
[03:49:00]  We have, uh, Burns  Mm-hmm  And, uh  And, uh  Putrid farts I have  My stomach is just rebelling  Oh, please don't  What do we got?  I said we gotta go with Burns  That's some tough talk  It really is  Here's Foundry from the city  Ah, ah, ah, mine  We're kills, man  Oh, my God  What?  Jim from Jersey  Worst Lebanese bombing in months  Oh, wow  Ties it all together, doesn't he?  Oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh 
[03:49:30]  Holy shit  I got scared  The lyrics were bad  The lyrics intimidated me  Did the song actually  Wopped over this way?  That's what happens  Whenever he opens his CD case  Just diarrhea  What is that?  Someone left a Foundry CD in here  Find it  Holy shit  Toons has a question  Toons  Toons  I'm here, hold on  What's up, man?  Hey, uh  Is this how Stevie, uh  Lost all his weight?  Did he just listen to the CD 
[03:50:00]  And throw up all the time?  I want to know  If Steve was happy  On Flavor of Love  When they gave his CD  A plug  With that girl  Left on the steps  Tony in Seattle  God, the whole country  Is chiming in today  All I'm picturing is  Steve alone  In a room with a mirror  In his leopard skin dress  Going  I am a star  I am a star  Do you try practicing  How to sing  And what faces to make  For certain parts  Of the pendulum  Is it?  Rob  Mayo Pack 
[03:50:30]  What's up?  Hey, this sounds like  Great blowjob music  Kind of like a  Dreamweaver  Dreamweaver, right?  All right, shut up  You tripped on it  Stupid  Dreamweaver  Quiet  You're not going to  Kill my good time  Here listening to  Burned  Burned  From Foundry  From What Kills Me  CD available  Good drums  Nowhere  Nowhere  Yes  Oh  It's not even  Dangerous 
[03:51:00]  Get the fuck out  Now  Yeah  Sounds like  Ronnie James Theo  Is stepping up to a mic  Doesn't it?  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Va  Van Hallen  Drumming  Yep  Ooh, whoa. 
[03:51:30]  Changed directions there.  A little personal fate, Metallica.  A little Metallica, old school.  Were you in the other room singing?  Just buried in reverb.  Yeah, buried in reverb.  Never a good sign, you know.  Ooh.  There it is. 
[03:52:00]  Nice.  Ow!  Is that the top of your range?  Oh, yes.  You got a deep voice, I mean.  I was doing a lot of vocal, a lot of opera scale. 
[03:52:30]  Like, trying to get an opera scale.  Oh, yes.  Because, yeah, that was...  Do you feel like an opera singer?  Pavarotti.  Yeah, that was dangerously close to you, as far as high as I could go.  Pavarotti!  It asks me to do a certain event, though.  What about me? 
[03:53:00]  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  There you go, a little tape of stuff burned. 
[03:53:30]  And then Sniper from Wack Man goes, taking it all, huh, Steve?  Let's go to Cliff in Florida.  Cliff.  What's up?  This new album released worldwide, Hibernation.  Someone wants the band to reunite and play at one of the virus shows. 
[03:54:00]  Wow.  That would be cool.  That would be a good one.  I could probably put a couple of the guys together.  What's the other one doing?  He moved.  He moved.  That's like half the band.  That was put together, and I replaced half the guys a year after that.  You stayed together after this?  Yeah.  Remarkably.  Remarkably.  This was the last thing you did before you'd never smoke again.  Did you hear Pendulum?  Hello? 
[03:54:30]  Steven Carr.  Oh, Steven Carr rules.  I love Steven Carr.  I hate Steve C.  Steve C.  Steve C. is of no value.  Steven Carr from our friend.  Steven Carr rules.  I think they should play at a virus show.  We're just touching the surface here.  You should throw one of these songs up on the website.  I'll do the whole thing.  I'll put the whole thing up there.  Of course you will.  Of course you will.  I'll put the whole thing up there.  At this point, it's cathartic.  Just take it.  Do what you will. 
[03:55:00]  We should get it unsigned on XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That should get in a heavy rotation there.  Let's go to Robin in Delaware.  Robin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're on the air.  Hey, how are you guys?  Hello.  Continue.  Make a point.  Hey, I was just wondering if Steve sits around and watches old reruns of Beavis and Butthead  and thinks about the good old days.  It's not going to die.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:55:30]  You know, I knew your call was going to stink, but I didn't understand how badly it was going  to stink.  I'm going to rot me.  Let's go to Roger.  Can we have a buttery beat, please?  Buttery beat.  You need a buttery beat?  Clean the palate.  I want to clean my oral palate.  All right.  Here's a buttery beat.  Here's a little musical sorbet.  Hey.  Tasty.  Can you let me swing it? 
[03:56:00]  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  How'd your parents die?  Can't wait tomorrow.  Can we hear what you told me?  Yeah, yeah, tomorrow.  Okay.  You'll hear more from Foundry.  Oh, this is in the open?  Petri, Stephen Carr. 
[03:56:30]  I bet you tomorrow we should play something on a little CBS, give them the entire time.  All right, we're out of here.  Steve's willing to put the whole thing up on Foundry because he knows no one will find it.  Ow.  That was the advantage.  Take the wig from FBA.com.  Very funny.  All right, we'll leave you guys with a buttery beat today.  Have a great day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you, Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr is a douche. 
[03:57:00]  We'll see you tomorrow.  Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it.  Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it.  The virus is ready. 
[03:57:30]  The virus isn't saddish.  The virus isn't saddish.  O-A-Virus.com.  Assault the media.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from words you dump on Norton's belly, the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.
