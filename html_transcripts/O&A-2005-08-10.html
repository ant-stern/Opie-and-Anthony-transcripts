<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion of their "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" campaign, promoting their "WOW" stickers and a hotline for reporting sightings of women exposing themselves to drivers displaying the stickers.  They provided their address for sticker requests and mentioned the website RapeMyWow.com, which featured submitted topless photos.  This segued into a discussion of a photo of Anthony's headphones, an "Afro show" with Ron and Fez, and the replacement of their former co-host Dice with Bob Saget (humorously suggested).  They also referenced anti-gay PSAs from the 1940s.

The hosts then detailed the "Assault on the Media" contest, highlighting a particularly memorable entry featuring a man in a lion costume.  Prizes included a MyFi, a day in the studio, and a Joey's Restaurant gift certificate.  Opie recounted a neck injury sustained while reaching for a toothbrush, blaming dehydration from the X Games and a bad LA hotel.  His anger boiled over regarding his exclusion from an XM Radio event's "secret room" by Stephanie and Ann Taylor, sparking a lengthy rant about their perceived mistreatment by XM management.  They also vented frustration at negative comments on the WackBag and other message boards, insulting the posters with homophobic and derogatory slurs.

Next, the show moved to a critique of Russ Martin's radio show, contrasting his claimed large audience with their own subscriber count.  A listener provided additional commentary.  "Operation Mayhem," a listener-based project, and the "golden ticket" initiative for satellite radio transition were also discussed, along with reviews of several listener submissions for the golden ticket initiative, including bizarre and offensive content from Marco and Aaron (including "Bathroom Slaves"), and equally "bad" submissions from Nick and George.  A caller commented on the pumpkin theft story from Nick and George’s audition.  The hosts further reviewed contest entries from the "Assault on the Media," including a man dressed as Cape Guy and one featuring a Howard Stern mask.  They also analyzed a publicity photo of Opie, focusing on his crotch.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to Jimmy Norton’s anxiety over a delayed couch delivery, punctuated by expletives and humorous frustration.  "The Gooch," a caller who owned a delivery company, shared similar experiences.  Norton's exclusion from the XM Radio event was again discussed, and fueled further angry calls and emails.  The hosts covered a news story about invasive snakehead fish ("Frankenfish"), contrasting its sensationalism with the reality.  A news story about a priest involved in a scandalous affair was also covered with crude, sexually suggestive commentary.  In-studio guest Jim Gaffigan was present, with scheduled appearances by Dick Cavett and Andy Dick ultimately cancelled.  Wheelchair Fred called in, referencing a Penthouse interview featuring him and the hosts, and soliciting money from listeners.  Several audio clips from other radio shows were played.

A lengthy segment focused on Wheelchair Fred's demands for payment, leading to humorous exchanges about his finances and past, including a motorcycle accident.  Dane Cook called in to promote his CD *Retaliation* and briefly discussed *Torgasm*, also making vulgar comments about Patrice O'Neal.  The show heavily mocked the Maury Povich Show, specifically focusing on guests with physical deformities and disabilities, using offensive language and playing audio clips.  Bob the Trucker called in to criticize this segment.  Clips from Marco and Aaron's show were played, mocking their content.  More Maury Povich Show mockery and a Gamefly commercial concluded this segment.

The show opened a new segment discussing Deepak Shahagardar's prison sentence for sexually assaulting a sleeping woman on a Delta flight.  The hosts graphically detailed the assault and speculated on the flight attendants’ inaction.  A caller, John, commented on the Maury Povich Show's tendency to interview mothers of children with deformities, leading to more clips featuring children with various medical conditions, with Serena, one of the twins, present in the studio.  The hosts made insensitive jokes about their appearances, and plugged BigFunToys.com.  The show continued with more jokes about children with deformities, including one with cherubism.  Finally, callers shared what they "learned" from the show, before a final plug for Jim Gaffigan’s upcoming show.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zeltzer.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:04:30]  Mom!  I love the Lord!  I have to do this now!  It's impossible!  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You have the tears to come out of my eyes?  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!  That's funny.  I'm funny. 
[00:05:00]  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Oh, good Lord.  You're just a tool.  You're just a tool.  You're just a tool.  You're just a fucking tool.  Hi.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Oh, it is Wednesday.  Do we have the WOW signing hotline yet? 
[00:05:30]  Of course we don't.  What happened?  What happened?  We asked for that about a week ago.  We want to make it very easy for the people out there that are getting flashed for having a WOW sticker on their car.  Yes.  Or a WOW sign on their truck or vehicle.  Indeed.  And we want this hotline.  A WOW sighting hotline.  And people can call up with their interesting WOW sightings without babbling on and on when we take a live call.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  That way we can sift through them and get the good one.  Dude, I'm on I-75 and I just saw fun bags.  There you go.  Yeah.  And we would play them and everyone would laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh.  Party har-har.  And then we could like, you know, do the radio show without taking too much time.  Going to the hundreds of phone calls every week from people that are seeing boobs all over the highways.  There you go.  If you need a WOW sticker, it's very simple.  Send in a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City and we'll send out the WOW stickers immediately. 
[00:06:30]  The address if you've got a pen and pencil.  Pen and pencil.  Pen and pencil doesn't work.  Pen and paper does work.  Or pencil and paper.  That would be 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  And that address is up on opianthony.com.  But simple as this, you throw a WOW in your car, there are girls out there that will flash you when they see that.  Okay.  I just had to check my own headphones.  I'm looking at the instant feedback. 
[00:07:00]  It says, I was looking at the studio pics Steve put up on Foundry yesterday.  And I have a few questions.  Did Ant write his name with silver marker on his headphones?  Yeah, he thinks I'm crazy because he thinks I wrote Anthony on my headphones so no one else could use him because I'm a germaphobe or something.  But I had to look and see.  And I have my headphones off and look.  And yes, it is written on there, but I didn't write it.  No, you're not that freaky. 
[00:07:30]  See, whoever gave us the new headphones because we were bitching about our headphones a while back wrote it because they're petrified of us is what it is.  And they wanted everybody to have their own headphones.  That's why, sir, that was Connor from Wackbag.  There are pictures and videos of the Afro show that we did yesterday.  Yeah.  An Afro show is basically when Anthony and I get together with Ron and Fez.  Yes, it's Anthony, Fez, Ron, Opie.  There you go.  It was an Afro show, people have been saying, or Afron. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because now there's an N involved.  That's right.  You fucked up the whole concept.  Afro is fun.  Afro works.  The N can be how your hair looks.  You look like a bunch of N's.  That's true.  That's right.  You messed up our whole thing.  What is it called when you do that thing?  That thing?  Where it's Afro.  It's a thing.  There's a name for that where you take the first letter of names and then make it a thing.  Oh, right.  One of those. 
[00:08:30]  Come on.  Stop.  I just got a mental block.  It's not an acronym?  Yeah.  It's not.  No, acronym.  No, and I...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And it's an acronym.  Okay, anagrams are when you have one word.  It's the acronym.  Acronym.  It is an acronym.  Acronym.  All right.  So we got pictures and video of the Afro show and Bob Saget, who was dirty as hell yesterday.  Yes.  The filthy, potty-mouthed Bob Saget.  You know what?  I want to make Bob Saget kind of a regular on this program.  Yeah.  I got so excited listening to the replay yesterday.  I'm like, this guy could do radio.  He's dirty.  He just gets it. 
[00:09:00]  He's quick.  Yep.  You know, and everyone knows we're pretty much done with Dice.  So let's replace him with Bob Saget.  Why not?  Dice was so 80s, and we stretched it out into the mid to late 90s.  Dice has got to get over himself, is what he has to do.  He thinks we need him.  We don't need you, Dice.  Trust me on that.  Which way?  So we'll get Bob Saget involved with the radio program.  Yeah.  Also, the Drew Boogie Afro remix is now online. 
[00:09:30]  The little ditty we played to begin the Afro show yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And this is, I'm reading an email from Steve.  That's what I'm doing on my BlackBerry.  He also says that more girls sending in topless shots with their faces in the pictures.  That's key.  It really is.  It's so much sexier to have the girls with their faces in the picture.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  I don't like that decapitated look.  Well, Steve is all after you.  Fuck them.  Steve is running another website called the RapeMyWow.com, and girls are sending in topless pictures like crazy. 
[00:10:00]  And also, Steve writes, because I guess he's not coming in today.  He's got some personal stuff to take care of.  Nothing too exciting.  But he wrote, I sent Danny to 1940s.  The pilot light went out on his clothing.  Sent Danny to 1940s anti-gay PSAs.  Ooh.  Danny, do we have those yet?  Those are fun.  We'll have fun with that today as well.  We love looking back into the 40s.  Also, the Assault on the Media winner for the month of July is here to get his prizes. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, how's that going, the Assault on the Media?  It's going pretty well.  Yeah.  People assaulting.  I've seen a couple of video clips.  Pretty funny.  Well, people are trying almost every day.  The problem is, Lion guy from Alabama.  Yeah.  Was it Alabama?  Alabama, man.  He's just kicking ass.  Yeah.  He was the first entry pretty much for the contest in August, and no one's coming close yet. 
[00:11:00]  No one.  How do you beat a guy in a lion suit?  Right.  Yelling Opie and Anthony.  Right.  With a sign.  It was great.  And, you know, the winner of the contest for the month of August will win a MyFi courtesy  of MyRadioStore.com, a day in the studio with us, and other prizes to be named, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  We are throwing in a gift certificate to go hang out at Joey's Restaurant in Little Italy.  Oh.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yeah.  Nice.  Hang out outside. 
[00:11:30]  Watch some of the action.  I'm miserable.  I pulled out my neck lifting yesterday.  Lifting what?  Weights.  It doesn't have to be up there.  Lifting weights, and now you pull your neck out.  I'm very irritable.  Yeah.  I pulled it out really fucking hard.  Did you wrench it?  Oh, yeah.  I wrenched it.  I'm, like, eating Aleves like they're Tic Tacs.  Ooh.  The Aleves help.  You need Vicodin, my friend.  Yeah, I know.  That's the good stuff. 
[00:12:00]  I know.  I walk in, and, Jesus, there's a bunch of pill poppers at work here.  Tic Tac, what do you need?  First thing I said was, you know, I fucked up my neck, and everyone's like, hey, Vicodin?  What do you need?  Do you want this, this?  No, I'm all right.  I'll just do the Aleve.  Thank you very much.  Is it that you can't turn your neck thing?  Well, you've got to look to your side, and you've got to turn your shoulders and everything?  Oh, it's just below my left shoulder and where the, you know, the spine is, sort of.  Yeah.  On the left side of the spine.  I usually do that, like, looking at the computer monitor. 
[00:12:30]  Something really strenuous, like moving the mouse or right-clicking.  Well, what happened was, when we moved our hotel to a nice hotel when we were out in  L.A.  Oh, from the shithole we were originally in?  Instead of the dump that we were staying in?  By the refinery?  You know, the suite we were supposed to have?  Yeah.  Not that we're complaining, because how many people can relate to our stupid complaining?  Oh, we're just bitch divas, aren't we?  I think you're right.  But when someone tells you you're going to have a suite, I assume we're going to have 
[00:13:00]  a suite.  Suite.  You know?  Yeah.  Did you have a bottle of water in your suite?  I didn't.  I had a bottle of water and some candy bars.  Ooh.  And instead of a suite, I had a balcony that they freshly painted, so I couldn't use that.  And the whole idea of this place was that it overlooked the ocean.  Right.  I had a phone that didn't work, and I had a shower where the water wouldn't drain, so  as I'm taking a shower, you had to hurry up, because for some reason the water was flowing 
[00:13:30]  out of the shower head and the faucet at the same time.  Just leaking.  Oh, so you were on a time limit, man, because the tub was filling up really fast.  I've never seen so much water coming from one tub in my life.  Just flying out of everything.  Oh, yes, and it's not draining, so you're kind of knee-deep in your own scum trying to  shower up.  Yeah, that's great.  You've got, like, scum ring around your ankles. 
[00:14:00]  So, yeah, it was a shitty hotel.  Yeah.  Because someone's wondering about that.  And so we moved to a nice hotel on Sunset out there in L.A., and I guess it was Saturday  morning, I went to the bathroom.  I think we were dehydrated from doing the X Games.  That's how you pull a lot of your muscles, you know.  Oh, yeah, they're not lubed up.  There's not enough water in your muscles.  So, I think being in the hot sun and not drinking much water and stuff, we all were a little  dehydrated. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  So, Saturday morning, all it took was reaching for a toothbrush.  That's how you wrenched your neck?  Yeah.  I didn't even, like, jump out of bed weird or anything.  I was just reaching for a toothbrush.  That's awful.  And I pulled it slightly.  And then yesterday, it went all the way.  Eric's never had that problem.  Hmm?  Nothing.  Oh.  What was the problem?  Oh.  It's actually really good.  You'll have to listen to the replay.  No, I might be busy.  Pulled it.  Opie pulled his neck. 
[00:15:00]  Reaching for a toothbrush.  I didn't want to have to repeat it, but I hate when Jimmy thinks I bombed.  No, I knew you didn't, because I knew I saw the look on your face.  It was like, laugh should be a coming.  And I knew I was reading.  Laugh should be a coming.  Round the bend.  That was a good one.  This just in from Ben Sparks.  The wow line has been ordered.  So, we'll have that up and running, hopefully, in the very near future.  If Ben says it, it's got to be true.  Where if you get wowed on the highway, you can call up the wow hotline, the wow sighting 
[00:15:30]  line, whatever we call it, and announce that you just saw fun bags.  Yes, according to Jim Norton, you guys are fancy people.  We certainly are.  So, I'm a bit irritable because of the neck thing, and then because of something that  happened yesterday that, quite frankly, I don't understand on any level.  And I will personally be getting to the bottom of it with Mr. Eric Logan.  Uh-oh. 
[00:16:00]  Who is flying, I believe, to Toronto today.  What's going on in Toronto?  Is this the big XM Canada meeting or something?  I don't know what he's doing in Toronto, but he was giving me location checks at 5.20 in  the morning.  Was he?  He's text messaging me as I'm having my morning coffee.  Did you...  He was ranting and raving on how great the show was yesterday.  It really was a good show.  I listened to the replay.  It was very good.  He wants to know if we're still on for tomorrow.  I forgot to tell you, Anthony, I think he wants to do lunch or dinner tomorrow. 
[00:16:30]  You guys have a great time.  I will be home by noon.  Oh, spoke to Elo.  He is...  This is a note from Ben Sparks.  Spoke to Elo.  He is upset about what happened and we'll get to bottom of it.  I adore Elo.  We love Elo.  Who doesn't?  And I can't wait for him to start firing the dead weight at XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, my goodness.  And there's a lot of dead weight.  Get out his axe. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, I just...  I had a bad show yesterday.  I was tired.  You are first on the list, little Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  I'm Mr. Marshall.  That's right.  All right, who is this fucking Jothan, Jothan, Jothan asshole?  Jesus, who?  I don't know.  I'm going after everybody today.  Who is that?  I wish I could give you an answer, but I don't even know what you just said.  No, it's not Jonathan.  It's Jothan.  This fucking guy...  Should we attack this guy?  Who is he? 
[00:17:30]  I just got a BlackBerry, right?  Computer.  Who is this?  What happened, Eric?  Because that's what's been happening with me.  We can't get into Foundry or anything here.  It's not willing to do anything.  This motherfucker...  Did he hack something?  I don't know if he's hacking, but maybe we can get to the bottom of this.  You've got to give him something.  That's pretty cool.  No.  Don't you wish you could do shit like that?  I don't even know what his website is.  But basically, I got a BlackBerry, right?  So I can check out some of the websites.  Yeah.  You know, the scumbags at WackBag, and our website, opianathlete.com, and foundyourmusic.com. 
[00:18:00]  I just, I fucking hate the message boards.  They're a bunch of assholes.  Yes, they are.  They're not getting any of my support.  They do tend to have some real morons aboard.  To the douchebags on WackBag, use your fucking brains.  Obviously, she was in the middle of talking and cursing out a photographer and didn't want  her picture taken.  That's all it is, you fucking assholes. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And we just...  We got some support on there.  A couple of people chimed in and said what the deal was.  I don't care, but use your fucking brain and stop trying to make more of something than  it is.  A bunch of guys in WackBag trying to claim that Lindsay's not hot.  It's like, are you fucking insane?  Obviously, they are flaming homosexuals.  That shouldn't even make you mad, though.  It's like such a...  It's like, yeah, and I heard they said Earl isn't black. 
[00:19:00]  And I'm not just saying that because she's your girl.  They have no fucking idea.  They have no fucking idea.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  And to all these guys that are, you know, trying to make more out of it than there is,  keep living in Two Town, because that's where you reside.  Two Town.  Ooh.  You have no fucking idea.  It's ridiculous.  You'll... 
[00:19:30]  After a while.  Always get assholes.  Yeah.  Just doesn't fucking matter what...  What goes on, there's always going to be assholes.  When someone is giving a look at a reporter and in the middle of pretty much saying,  go fuck yourself, there's no good picture going to be taken.  Of course not.  Stop it.  Moron.  You guys have no fucking idea.  Continue living in Two Town and hope for my support.  Two Town.  Two Town stinks, believe me.  I reside in Fivesville. 
[00:20:00]  Occasionally, I'll make an excursion into...  Anyway, so, uh...  The cab doesn't even go to Fivesville from Two Town.  No.  He's got to stay there.  Wait for a livery driver.  Or is it livery?  Livery?  Well, that's the problem with the message boards, you know.  People that just don't use their brains and they're just picking and trying to find something  that's not there.  It's like, you bunch of assholes.  Go to another thread.  There's nothing there.  It's obvious what that picture is all about.  So, anyway, and so I got the BlackBerry and I want to, you know, check out opianthony.com 
[00:20:30]  and I go to this douchebag's website and I can't get around it.  I don't know.  I have no idea, but now it's happening on the computers in the studio.  No way.  Yeah, because Eric was trying to get on Foundry.  Some guy, Jothan...  What is this?  Like, if you pop in foundrymusic.com on this computer in the studio,  you go to this Jothan, Jothan, Jothan website. 
[00:21:00]  I don't even know what the website is.  Well, Ant got there on his computer, so...  Yeah.  Obviously, he didn't mess with Foundry.  I just got there.  See?  Foundrymusic.com, my friend.  Did you try to go through...  It's on the corporate system, not on the independent systems.  Yeah, it's on the corporate systems, right?  So, I don't know what that's about.  Someone's got to, like, look into it.  I'm independent.  Because I want to fucking strangle this fucking guy.  And your BlackBerry's a corporate system?  I guess.  So, I can't get on OpenAnthony.com, because it goes... 
[00:21:30]  That URL goes right to this...  And what's his site about?  I don't know.  Is it in English?  No one can figure it out.  Just a douche.  So, anyway.  Anyway, alright.  So, spoke to Elo.  He is upset about what happened, and we'll get to bottom of it.  This is what happened yesterday.  It just amazes me.  And there's a bunch of people at XM that are sick of us bitching, but, you know, when it's justified, sorry.  It has to be spoken about. 
[00:22:00]  So, I'm at lunch yesterday with my lovely girlfriend that some people think is not lovely.  Fucking ass wipes.  And I get a call from Don Wicklund, right?  Who runs 202.  Wiki!  And he goes, dude, I was just at the Christmas in August thing that XM is throwing, and you've got to see all the new, you know, hardware that's coming out in the fall and in time for Christmas. 
[00:22:30]  We went last year.  Yeah, we went last year.  So, you get to see all the cool shit that's coming out.  And I've got to be honest, this stuff is amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  I have no problem with that.  You know, it's obvious that we're way ahead of Sirius.  Way ahead.  Okay?  So, I go, Don, really?  Where is that happening?  He goes, at our new Lincoln Center facility.  We are three blocks from our new Lincoln Center facility.  Yes, we are.  See, XM has two different studios in New York.  We have our own here on 57th Street. 
[00:23:00]  What's this?  This is just in from Ben.  Another urgent communique.  Sorry.  I just found out about yesterday in the event.  This is totally unacceptable how Opie was treated.  Inacceptable?  And that's not me reading it wrong.  I want to know who and what was said.  I will be there tonight and we'll discuss.  I will have conversations while I'm in Toronto.  That's why I love Eric Logan.  He is the go-to guy.  I'll tell you right now, if Eric Logan wasn't hired, you know, we would be so fucked. 
[00:23:30]  We would be so fucked.  Yeah.  Anyway, so, I go, really?  You know, Christmas in August?  Three blocks away from where we broadcast.  We broadcast at 57th Street between 6th and 7th.  And they're like literally a couple blocks over.  Not even, right?  Yes.  I go, well, why weren't we invited?  Or why didn't anyone tell us about this?  Turns out half of Washington was up yesterday and we didn't know about it. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  We're supposedly one of the big things happening on XM right now.  And no one even tells us this is going on.  You know, I have no problem.  Anthony likes to go home right away.  But maybe even Anthony would have wanted to check out the technology.  You're into the technology stuff.  Certainly.  And, you know, maybe we could help.  Shake some hands.  Say hi.  Check out the new equipment so we can come on the air today and talk about it.  You and I walk by Lincoln Center on the way home.  Yeah, I know.  Every day.  So I go walking over there and a lot of people are really surprised to see me there for some reason. 
[00:24:30]  Like, oh, almost like, what are you doing here?  And I want to say I work for the fucking company, assholes.  So I get my press credentials and I check out all the fine equipment, which is absolutely amazing.  You're going to love the stuff that is coming out.  And most of the people that work in Washington on a full-time basis could care less that I'm there. 
[00:25:00]  Barely acknowledging me.  I mean barely.  Barely, barely, barely.  Absolutely no representation whatsoever that we even work for the company in this big room.  None.  You know how they had the huge, like, cutouts last year of our faces?  Oh, boy.  Yes, I do remember that.  Well, they had, like, one for Ars Confidential and I think one for Al Franken and one for this person in Major League Baseball.  Not even a clue that we work for the company.  Not even represented in this room.  Well, you're not even on the front page of the website, I don't think, anymore.  Someone emailed me.  Huh? 
[00:25:30]  Not even on the XM radio, XM.com.  Not even a clue.  And it's like, I see what they're doing.  It's like a highbrow event and they don't want our names associated with us.  They're selectively marketing things from the platform.  Which just shows that you don't really know how to market, in my opinion.  Yeah.  If you were really good at marketing, you would be able to, you know, make it all make sense.  Ars Confidential, Major League Baseball, Air America, Opie and Anthony, Bob Edwards.  You'd be able to somehow market it in such a way where it makes sense for everyone and makes your company look very respectable. 
[00:26:00]  Is it true that the marketing guy just looked at you from across the room, waved, and went, good luck, bro?  I think I got a hey from him.  A hey?  I got a hey.  And no joke, a hey.  That was it.  Hey.  Granted, very busy guy because, you know, he was running the show.  But that's all I got was a hey.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, that whole thing was, he was running that whole thing?  Cool.  He's good at what he does. 
[00:26:30]  So then.  Oh.  Oh.  I love right guard sports.  Me too.  So then I hear that there's a, this is where I'm just amazed.  And Eric Logan will get to the bottom of this.  Yes, he will.  There was a top secret room.  A top secret room, people.  It was Christmas in August, thrown by XM.  We weren't invited.  That's pretty wacky. 
[00:27:00]  That was very obvious.  We weren't invited.  No one asked us to go, even though they were all up from Washington.  And then they have this top secret room with a few gadgets.  Gadgets?  Like the new, new technology that's not even out yet.  Right.  Exactly.  Secret.  Prototypes, what have you.  I don't know.  That are going to be pretty, pretty impressive, I guess, when they hit the market.  A mini sub and a flying car.  So it was off to this one area.  Yeah.  Like if you thought what you saw in the big room was cool. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Oh, come over here.  We got some other things to show you guys.  Blow jobs.  No?  In the back room.  So, stupid me being, you know, I've been told by Eric Logan that we're one of the big  things happening at XM.  Stupid me, I walk up to the room like, I'm ready to see the secret gadgets.  Yeah.  I am ready.  I'm, uh, I'm walking in the room.  I want to see the gadgets.  Oh, you can't see the secret gadgets. 
[00:28:00]  That's what happened.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Oh, and I looked ridiculous.  Right.  I looked ridiculous. 
[00:28:30]  Because there was a bunch of people that were getting ready to go into the secret room.  I guess they needed the people that were going into the secret room to sign some paperwork.  Which is fine.  To basically say that you won't talk about it for your publication.  Because I think the press was invited there.  So, you know, you can't talk about it until a certain date or all hell will break.  So the blabbermouth press is allowed to go into the secret room.  So Stephanie, who works in marketing.  Do I know her?  Because I back it up with names, people.  I don't know her.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  And Ann, what's her name?  Ann Taylor.  Ann Taylor and Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Who thinks she has all this power at XM.  You're a dead weight.  You stink and you know it.  Stephanie tells me I can't go into the secret room to see the secret gadgets.  And what did you say?  And then I'm like, Stephanie, you're a nobody in my life, so I will go to Ann Taylor.  And I go, Ann, I want to go see the secret gadgets.  You're not allowed to see the secret gadgets. 
[00:29:30]  Well, who told you I'm not allowed to see the secret gadgets?  Who said?  I didn't get a name.  Why didn't you get a name?  Because corporate America is filled with cowards and people can't just be honest and say this is who said it and this is why.  Yeah.  It's all corporations.  I was stupefied.  Now, we weren't even invited.  We weren't even invited.  So there probably wasn't a directive that Opie or Anthony or both aren't allowed in the back room.  Because we weren't even invited.  They didn't even expect any of us to show up. 
[00:30:00]  When you show up and want to get into the secret room, there hasn't been this directive given to these people that you're not supposed to be there.  They made it off the cuff.  They fired that from the hip and said, yeah, you know something?  No, you can't go.  It was just her.  That's what I'm saying.  Stephanie said I couldn't see the secret gadgets in the secret room and also Ann Taylor.  Those are the two I talked to.  And they had no reason why I couldn't see the secret gadgets.  They just knew I couldn't see the secret gadgets. 
[00:30:30]  I can't believe you didn't press her more.  Yeah.  And go, excuse me.  Why?  Who?  Secret gadget.  Dude, most people were looking at me like, why are you even here?  I'm like, are you kidding me?  Jesus.  And then I had to walk away.  I was, no joke, I was embarrassed.  I was embarrassed.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I wasn't sad.  I was embarrassed.  I was mortified.  How would you like to mow my lawn? 
[00:31:00]  Huh?  I was stupefied.  We're tanks for nothing.  Yeah.  Kevo from Philly is saying, let's face it, XM is Bushwood and you guys are Al Cervic.  I swear to God, I've been in radio, I don't know, when did I start?  When I was 14, so over 20 years now.  Yeah, with my math. 
[00:31:30]  Seven years.  Yeah, I love Anthony's math.  What percentage of your time in radio has been spent?  According to Anthony's math, I'm still in my 20s.  I love it.  Right.  It seems that you guys are the retarded child that no one wants in the family photos.  Yes.  So.  Yes, indeed.  So, I just couldn't believe it.  Yeah.  I had to walk away like, you're kidding, right?  You have to be kidding me.  So, I had to walk away.  You had to now turn away from the secret room and leave. 
[00:32:00]  Disgraced.  And then I just hit the elevator and left and I was just fuming like, we are working for  this company, right?  Don't laugh at me.  All I'm asking for in my stupid career before I retire, sooner than later, by the way, because  I've had it.  And trust me, I know you don't really care.  I'm just saying it.  It's just a little respect, Anthony. 
[00:32:30]  Just a little respect.  A little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.  Just a little bit.  Like, they're letting people into the secret room that don't even work for the company.  Secret room.  I work for the fucking company.  Secret room.  And they wanted people to sign stuff.  I would have been insulted if they made me sign something, but I would have at least signed  something just so I could see the secret stuff.  Like, alright, I get it.  Alright.  You know, I understand. 
[00:33:00]  You know, we're blabbermouths.  Okay, fine.  I'll sign something.  I understand the signing.  Yeah.  Is there any other show on the platform that talks as much about the new technology once  it's out than this show?  No.  Anybody else that talks as highly about the new technology?  Or smashes that dumb company across the street more than this show does?  No.  Fucking dumb bitch.  No.  Oh, God.  I swear to God, I'm so pissed off today.  What do you expect, dude?  You do your job.  Other people don't do their jobs. 
[00:33:30]  There's nothing more sickening than incompetence.  Secret room.  So now I'll read the note from Elo once again, because I don't want you guys thinking that  Elo doesn't get it.  This is from Ben.  Spoke to Elo.  He is upset about what happened, and we'll get to the bottom of it.  We would be so fucked if he wasn't in this company.  Mr. You, sir, I'm checking the list, sir.  No, your name is not on the list, sir.  I will check the list again, sir.  There is no Greg Hughes on the list, sir.  Let's go to Sherman in Atlanta. 
[00:34:00]  Sherman!  Yeah, I think you're on the fuckhole list.  You think?  They had the golden ticket list to get into the secret room, and their own fuckhole list.  Yeah, I think the regular guys must have called up there and said, we don't want OPMR shuttle there.  Yeah, this company, it's just exploding.  Absolutely exploding.  I understand that.  Satellite radio exploding.  The gadgets are amazing that are coming out.  But, man, I can't wait for some heads to roll. 
[00:34:30]  I can't wait for XM to get some real people in there.  I can't wait.  Cannot wait.  Elo, we're counting on you, sir.  Elo, we are counting on you.  Do what's right.  Pat, what's up?  Elo will slice like a fucking hammer.  The boys get gadgets.  The boys get gadgets.  Gadgets.  Punch it out.  The secret gadget room.  I can't believe you didn't get into the secret gadget room. 
[00:35:00]  Bobby Bigrigger, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, could it be that you didn't bring your golden ticket?  Is that why they didn't let you in?  Yeah.  You know, anyone without a golden ticket wasn't allowed to go into Willy Wonka's factory.  It was just amazing that they, I swear to you, and I'm not making this up,  people were looking at me like, you weren't invited.  How did you?  You crashed their little party.  We made sure that you guys weren't invited.  A little upper crusty party.  Did Don Wickie get into the secret room? 
[00:35:30]  Well, he was there prior.  That's why he called me to say, you have to go over there, because the gadgets are amazing.  Oh, so he did get into the secret room.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know if he got into the actual secret room.  I'm sure he did.  He said the gadgets are amazing.  Well, in the big room.  They had the gadgets that are pretty much going to be out on the market,  or are on the market right now.  You know, the Tau and the Panasonic handheld.  Yeah.  And they got this thing for the MiFi, where you dock it and it has its speakers right there,  kind of like what the iPod was doing.  Uh-huh.  Where you pop your iPod in and it has, you know, speakers. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  So you don't have to plug it into a stereo when you're at home.  That's handy.  Definitely.  But it just amazes me that we were not invited.  It's not amazing.  We were not invited.  It's typical, and people don't like when they're called out when they don't do their jobs.  And that's anywhere.  Nobody likes being called out when they're not doing their jobs.  You know what happens?  If we come on the air and don't do our jobs, we get fired.  Sometimes even when we do do them.  Yes.  The show is canned.  Do them well.  But if you're not doing your job, you're going to be called out. 
[00:36:30]  Why is it a problem for people?  I want to know why we weren't invited.  I need an answer.  I need an answer.  When Stephanie prevented me from going into this secret room, she had to be corrected.  Bob in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Bob.  Hey, boys.  Hi.  I was wondering if you heard the Incredible Hulk walking away music.  Oh.  Were they playing that for you?  Dude, we've all been in that situation. 
[00:37:00]  I didn't know what to say at that point.  And they kind of started looking down.  And now I had to, like, I had to turn and walk away all awkwardly and make believe it was cool.  Like, oh, I'll, uh, well, uh, I guess I'll go get a shrimp.  Because they had food there.  Oh, I'm hungry anyway.  I'll go.  I'll, uh, oh, that's all right.  I didn't want to be in the secret room.  Nah, it's, uh, I, uh, whoa, hey, uh, look at the time.  I got to go to the gym and pull out my neck. 
[00:37:30]  Uh, nah, that's cool.  Well, you were alone, right?  Nah, I was with Lindsay.  Oh, no, in front of your chick.  You get scorned.  Oh.  I'll, uh, oh, that's okay.  I, uh, nah, I don't feel like I just started radio again.  Nah, I don't feel like I'm doing overnights in god-awful Buffalo for $12,000 a year.  Don't, don't worry about it.  I guess I'll, uh, I guess I'll see the secret gadgets when they hit the market in a year. 
[00:38:00]  When they're not secret anymore.  When they're just gadgets.  Don't worry.  I'll, uh, I'll see them at Best Buy in three or four months.  Jesus.  I think they typed a directive.  Opie can't go into the room.  Uh, Mike Hunt is saying, uh, that they were afraid Opie would smash all the new gadgets.  Just picking them up and throwing them on the floor.  Thank you, Mike Hunt.  Always funny.  Every, I actually laughed when you said Mike Hunt said it. 
[00:38:30]  37, I still chuckle at that dumb name.  Well, I demand now.  I demand a private showing of what was in the secret room.  I want Elo to guide us through our own little secret room.  Wearing something comfortable.  Yes.  Something he wears at home.  Maybe sweatpants.  Sweatpants.  Some kind of an awful shirt with a college on it that he never attended. 
[00:39:00]  I am going to be watching very closely how certain people are doing their jobs in Washington.  Uh-oh.  And I will call you out every fucking time.  You know how we complained about the equipment at one point?  Things weren't working.  And then they fixed it.  Everything is good now.  I saw Tony.  I said, Tony, the studio you built for us with the help of the boys, Ed Schwartz and everybody,  and Don Wicklund helped out, you know, getting the bugs out. 
[00:39:30]  I said, it's amazing.  We're so happy.  Thank you.  He was one of the guys that actually talked to me.  He's like, thanks.  We're really, really happy at the facility you guys, you know, built for us.  So.  I don't know why they resent you at Lincoln Center.  If it wasn't for the belly aching of this show, that Lincoln Center thing probably wouldn't have been opened.  Yeah.  True.  There was a bunch of kvetching.  A bunch of complaining on our part.  And now they have a nice new center.  You're welcome. 
[00:40:00]  Don't you go into that secret room, Opie.  You stay out of that room.  You like gadgets, Doc?  Why can't I go in?  Stephanie says I'm not a sposter.  Hopped on his big wheel and pedaled away.  Why is she telling me that I can't be in a secret room?  I don't even know who she is.  Her whole job is to hang fucking XM satellite radio banners. 
[00:40:30]  That's your job.  Hang the banners and shut up.  And she was telling you you couldn't go into the secret room.  Right.  I don't know her.  Were there any...  With no explanation.  No go talk to Chance or somebody and see what we can work out.  Nothing.  Not because you're on air.  I was standing there like, what?  And I had to walk away all embarrassed.  Oh, boy.  That's...  That is embarrassing.  And you know what's awful?  Like, when something like this happens, if you want...  Like, this is why I love Richard Huff.  He came on the phone. 
[00:41:00]  Everything was worked out.  People will never just address it honestly.  They wouldn't come on.  And no one's going to scream at you on the show.  Nobody would ever go on the phone and go, look, this is what happened.  This is why that happened.  Yeah.  Never.  All right.  Well, someone's wondering, were there any other personalities there?  I saw Lou Brutus.  Secret room?  No.  I don't know who was in the secret room. 
[00:41:30]  Because you weren't in.  How do you know who's in the secret room if you're not in the secret room?  They had guards there.  There was black curtains.  All sorts of stuff.  Well, you couldn't even peek in the secret room to maybe get a glimpse.  You should have run in.  Because they had a fake black wall right at the door.  So you had to go in and go through kind of a maze to get to the gadget.  How funny would that have been?  Or be arrested for running into the secret room to look at the gadget.  If you just bolted in, just run, full bore.  And then you have to hear from people in Washington. 
[00:42:00]  People in Washington are starting to get really sick of you guys trashing the company.  We don't trash the company.  No.  I had four or five people come by my desk today and said that you guys were awfully negative today on this show.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That is a perfect example why.  Exactly.  I'd like to know who talks like that at XM.  My impressions are not accurate.  It wasn't bad.  I just didn't realize that Peter Lorre was an employee. 
[00:42:30]  I just changed the voice so it sounds like someone else is talking.  That's how I do it.  Someone said you're negative.  Negative.  See, I changed...  I was sitting at my desk.  See, I changed the voice so people don't think it's Opie talking.  It's an actual person that's not associated with Opie talking.  Why do I sound like Ren?  I didn't...  Shut up, Billy West.  I didn't talk like that.  Okay, Cap'n.  No one in this company smashes the company across the street faster than this show. 
[00:43:00]  Nobody.  With more effectiveness.  Other than your technology department, which has done a nice job of that.  But no one vocally smashes them as fast as we do.  Or no one talks about the new stuff when it's out as much as we do.  It's really irritating.  Yeah, well...  Stand out the company.  We hate the other company.  We like being here.  Well, instead of, you know, spending 20 minutes talking about how great the stuff was I saw  yesterday, I had to talk about the secret room.  See?  See what happens?  I got all distracted.  Did you attempt a call to Elo immediately? 
[00:43:30]  I would have looked her right in the face, pulled out my cell phone, call up Elo, and right  there, right there, go, would you like to speak to Eric Logan about this?  You know where it came from, Oak.  You know where it came from.  Who?  Please.  Who's the boss?  Who's Stephanie's boss?  Is Ann Taylor?  I really don't know who...  I never heard of Ann Taylor either.  I don't know this Ann Taylor. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know what she does.  She's been very helpful.  You know, I really haven't had a problem with Ann Taylor, to be honest with you.  You know, I'm just naming names because that's how it went down.  Was there a directive, no on-air personalities from the company in the room?  But they didn't even explain to me.  Even that's unacceptable.  You're allowing members of the press in?  I was like, I thought they were kidding.  I'm like, oh, that's funny.  No, seriously, you can't come in.  Why?  You just can't.  Why?  You just can't. 
[00:44:30]  No reason why.  No reason whatsoever.  All right.  Doug out.  Yes, sir.  Can you wait through the break?  I'm sorry.  I had you on speakerphone.  I have to get dressed in the morning sometimes.  Can you wait through the break?  I can wait through the break.  All right, Doug out, Doug, one of the generals of the O&A Army, reporting in.  We'll talk to him next, okay?  Yes, sir.  All right, thank you, Doug out, Doug.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony program.  Like sentence through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[00:45:00]  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know...  How do my listeners tie a bandana around their car? 
[00:45:30]  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right, okay, whatever.  I got to go.  Please, I don't really want to get into discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars, jumping, grabbing. 
[00:46:00]  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Honk, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  My bandana.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I've done it all.  I did it already. 
[00:46:30]  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  I've done it all.  I've done it all.  I was the first one to do anything.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow. 
[00:47:00]  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented a traffic accident. 
[00:47:30]  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  It was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  That was me.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Give it to me.  We are all on drugs, yeah.  Never get it enough. 
[00:48:00]  We are all on drugs, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff.  Ah, Weezer, we are all on drugs.  Weezer.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  Stug out Doug has been waiting through the break.  What a gang.  A member of whackbag.com.  What's up, Doug?  What's going on, guys?  I wanted to just give a quick breakdown of what happened with Russ Martin yesterday. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah, Russ Martin.  One market sensation from Dallas, Texas.  Wow.  Another ass on the fucko list.  Another ass who is not honest, who lies through his teeth.  Russ Martin basically said that we have 8,000 to 9,000 subscribers.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And that he has, and he bragged that he has 500,000 listeners.  Ooh.  I don't know how else to put this.  I listened for a good hour yesterday, and... 
[00:49:00]  By the way, when Howard talks about clones and stuff, Russ Martin is a perfect example.  Yeah.  They imitate, you know, Howard's voice to a T.  Go ahead, Doug.  You were supposed to comment there, but go ahead.  A good hour I listened.  No, I'm just...  This guy, oh my God.  I listened for an hour and had no idea what he was talking about.  Awful.  No fucking clue what he was talking about.  He was talking about popping pills. 
[00:49:30]  He was doing this clever little thing where he was turning the mic off, and then they would  turn it back on, and they were laughing, because he's, you know, so extreme for FM radio, he's  got to mute himself, and him and his crew of, I think he had 35 people in there, it was  just so bad.  He didn't take many calls.  I got a call from Boston Strangler while I was on the way home from work yesterday.  He was talking.  He actually was screening his own calls.  He knew we were coming. 
[00:50:00]  He asked if he would take on the pests.  He said they wouldn't give us any free advertisements.  So, they didn't take many calls yesterday.  I know a couple of us did get through, but you know how excited we get for this.  I fell asleep an hour and 20 minutes into that show.  I was on my couch listening to it.  It was that fucking horrible.  You know you guys were a huge success, right?  You shut down the show yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  We definitely took over the phone lines again and crashed the message board before your 
[00:50:30]  show was over yesterday.  But, oh my God, this guy was fucking horrible.  This was God's honest truth.  I wanted to hear Moira pop in and start giving comments.  She would have been interesting.  He's another guy that wants to be on satellite radio, but he just doesn't have the talent  to make it to satellite radio.  He's a one-market sensation, and he'll continue doing well in Dallas.  Congratulations.  Ralph Martin?  Yeah.  I was making Pop-Tarts while I was listening yesterday, and I found myself more interested 
[00:51:00]  in the microwave humming.  The reality is, you know, because we do try to be as honest as possible on this show,  the guy does very well in Dallas.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe that he stinks in Dallas.  For some reason, they're eating up his show in Dallas, but that's it.  He's a one-market sensation.  I can't see it for the life of me.  It was just, the show started with all inside talk.  He didn't even start off a show.  He started talking inside talk about popping pills illegally, went into the news, and then 
[00:51:30]  talked for 45 minutes about I have no idea what.  I heard he wasn't even there yesterday.  He was actually in the secret room looking at the gadgets.  Well, you guys had a great show yesterday, man.  I know you guys didn't have a lot of time yesterday with Bob Saget coming in.  stuff, but the Afro show was just absolutely incredible, and Drew Boogie with that remix  and the theme, I mean, just goosebumps listening to that.  That was absolutely incredible. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, that was very cool.  Are you guys attacking Russ Martin again today?  Yeah, we're going to try.  All right.  Yeah, he was so brave talking about satellite radio and how we had only 8,000 to 9,000 subscribers  or listeners, and he was bragging about his 500,000.  You know, if he's a true good radio host, couldn't he just go with the whole thing?  No, he wouldn't.  And make something out of it?  Of course not.  He wouldn't even take it.  He had absolutely no interest in taking it because a couple of us like to try to sneak  around.  I know a few of us got through, but a couple of us like to drive head on and just say 
[00:52:30]  who we are and what we want to do, and he had no interest in doing it.  He did that old gag where he was at a break, and he was pretending to take calls because  he knew we were coming so he could, you know, tell us, ha-ha, you weren't even on the air  and hang up on us, and ugh.  Yeah.  Nah, he's...  He's just a fucking pussy, and just no talent, and just...  You guys definitely got under his skin.  Ugh.  I'm thinking if he doesn't acknowledge the pest today, that we just take over the entire  radio station.  We start calling all the sales lines and the secretaries, the business lines. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Why not?  Other shows.  Just not Pugs and Kelly.  Don't hassle them.  They're great, man.  Pugs and Kelly are friends.  Oh, the whole...  Yeah.  Take on all of XM because of what happened yesterday?  No, take on...  Oh, yeah.  No kidding.  We have our own problems.  I know that.  All right, Doug.  Guys, take it easy.  How's the top secret mission going?  The top secret mission, as a matter of fact, the two top secret missions, one of them 
[00:53:30]  is still under wraps.  Ooh, okay.  The first one was just released this week.  Okay.  And we're drumming up people, and we're determining a location for that one.  Okay, very good.  So we're moving, and we're actually looking more towards possibly doing it during a holiday  parade for maximum exposure.  Operation Mayhem?  Operation Mayhem.  Doug out, Doug, with a top secret mission.  All right, Doug.  Those of you that are in the know, go to the top secret website. 
[00:54:00]  If not, we will be filtering hints through the message boards.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  All right, guys.  I love the...  Bye, Doug.  We don't even know the URLs for the top secret message board.  Coming to the war room.  Where is it?  Yeah, there's secret rooms that we're not allowed in.  Yeah, we're not even allowed in our own secret rooms.  It knows.  It's blatant abuse of power is what this is.  Yeah.  Because now there's not just, like, missions going on.  There are now covert missions.  There's secret things going on that other people don't know about.  It's just horrible.  I know what the secret mission is. 
[00:54:30]  You don't have to fight it anymore.  Oh, you don't?  I already found out.  You know?  Yeah.  They're planning a big...  I don't care.  They're planning a surprise party for me.  They're not planning a surprise party for me.  Oh, my God.  It's...  What is it?  The 10th of August?  Jimmy.  It's not your birthday.  You know what you're doing.  Doug's probably in charge of getting the cake, and he's got the other guys getting the candles,  and maybe the pony, and the little...  Whoa!  What a surprise!  Guys!  Boy, are you going to be disappointed.  Why?  I want my birthday party. 
[00:55:00]  It's just about...  What is it?  A month now since your birthday?  You're going to run through a room, and there's just going to be this.  You're going to be...  Well, guys, I got a package today for my birthday.  My friend Dr. Steve sent me a nice birthday package.  It's not your birthday.  It certainly is.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Eric.  Hawk supportive.  Rest of your birthday, blockers.  All right, Anthony.  Golden ticket hopefuls.  Yeah.  It has begun.  Yes.  People very excited about the golden tickets. 
[00:55:30]  We gave out our first golden ticket to our pals Ron and Fez.  We have probably four more.  They're starting next month?  Yeah, September 12th.  They debut on 202, and we want to save maybe four more shows from commercial radio, and  then the rest of them will just rot.  On the fuck-o list.  On the fuck-o list.  So, people are sending in their shows like crazy.  Ah, very good.  Trying to get our attention.  Golden ticket hopefuls. 
[00:56:00]  We need another category, by the way.  Yeah?  We need, like, potential, the fuck-o's, and then in the middle, people.  So, we have, like, golden ticket, like, potentials, the ones that are pretty good.  Right.  Well, we have a short list, by the way.  Absolute fuck-o's.  We have a short list.  I like BJ Shea in Seattle.  I like Scott Farrell.  Mm-hmm.  We like Brother Wee's, and there's a couple other ones on the list, but we don't know if  they could get out of their contracts and stuff. 
[00:56:30]  So, it's still wide open.  And then you got the whole fuck-o list.  Oh, yeah.  And then you got people that are kind of in the middle of where we don't really hate them,  but they don't have enough talent to bring them to satellite radio.  Or we might not know them well enough.  You know?  Got to listen to them a little bit.  Right.  So, people are sending in their shows.  Travis is taking on this project.  Uh-oh.  Come on in here, Travis.  Take no chances, Travis.  Well, I'm getting, uh...  Every time now, boy, he just dubbed you with that, and now it's all I think about.  That's right. 
[00:57:00]  Is that your take no chances, Travis?  Hey, Travis, you want to run out and do it?  No, I'd rather not.  I'd rather somebody else go.  I'll just sit here where it's safe.  I don't have an umbrella.  It may rain.  Who knows?  The listeners are sending me potential shows and going, go check out their show, or here's  their website.  We don't have time to do that.  You got to send, you know, quick sample audio.  Exactly.  And Travis is finally going through all of it.  Right, Travis?  Yeah.  How can he do that while he's watching TV?  I do this at home. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, homework.  Mm-hmm.  Ooh.  And, uh, by the way, if you're sending audio into the show, it's very easy.  Send it to Steve.  Steve at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And Jothan will get it.  Huh?  And Jothan will get it.  All right.  So, Travis, you getting a lot of audio?  Uh, those were the first two.  Well, I have three shows, but one of the CDs wasn't formatted correctly.  So, those are the only two shows we have so far, I believe.  All right. 
[00:58:00]  Golden Ticket Hopefuls.  The Marco and Aaron show?  Yeah.  Uh, Jesus.  Marco and Aaron?  It's not good.  Who's Marco and Aaron?  I think they're on, uh, cable.  So, if you have Cox or Comcast cable, I think you can hear them.  It's a cable radio show?  Wait, how does that work?  I don't know.  And how do you listen to that show if you're in a car?  Very long cable?  There's a pool on your trunk.  Mobile home.  Yeah.  Mobile home.  That old gag.  All right.  So, they do a cable radio internet show? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  How would you, uh, categorize the program?  Bad.  Bad?  Yeah.  Talk?  Music?  Yeah.  No, it's talk.  Um, all the shows so far have been talk.  Ah, very good.  Uh, but it's not good.  All right.  Yeah, we got a couple, uh, examples of the Marco and Aaron show.  And Aaron.  Here's their first bit called Bathroom Slaves.  What's this about?  Uh, they're talking about the people that stand in the bathroom and, you know, give you wipes  and...  Oh, the bathroom attendants.  The washroom attendants. 
[00:59:00]  Ex-mayors of New York.  All right.  Don't you notice that in every club, every bar, there's a bathroom slave?  Yeah, no.  I don't understand that.  It's always a black dude.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How can you just sit there and smell people's stink?  The bathroom slave.  I get annoyed at the bathroom slave.  I don't tip them.  I tip them.  Yeah, I just get annoyed that when, you know, you're coming by and you get to the sink to  wash your hands, they look at you like...  Dude, I'm in here smelling crap all day.  Look, I'm going to show you chiclets. 
[00:59:30]  No, but see, no, the bathroom slave really gets...  It's disturbing that you're taking a piss and somebody's just waiting for you to clean  your hands.  That's great.  After you take a piss.  Wow.  What is wrong with that guy?  Wowie Kazowie.  He sounds like Voss singing opera.  Bathroom slave.  What is wrong with his voice?  I don't know, but that was probably the most fun listening I had, just trying to decipher  what he was.  Bathroom slave.  I can't tell people to be bathroom slave.  I'm bathroom slave.  It smells stink.  It smells stink. 
[01:00:00]  It's a bathroom slave.  What the hell was that?  Please tell me he's retarded and the whole thing is ironic and they're just making fun of  him.  By the way, golden ticket to them.  Absolutely.  I could listen to that all day.  That guy's terrific.  The bathroom slave.  Wow.  All right.  We have more of them?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Here's 40 seconds.  Gay locker room.  Part one.  Okay.  Well, just imagine this, okay? 
[01:00:30]  Just imagine this, okay?  You're a bathroom slave.  You're in the locker room.  I can take out the garbage.  Garbage?  That is what he sounds like.  Stupid Eddie.  Garbage?  Holy crap.  All right.  I'm a bathroom slave.  It's the Marco and Aaron show.  Can't get enough of these guys.  Certainly is.  Okay.  Well, just imagine this, okay?  I go inside the locker room.  This is so good.  No, I know.  Exactly.  That's why I put it on.  No, I know, I know, I know.  You're going to see old wrinkled balls trying to help you out.  The thing is, I go inside the freaking locker room and you see nothing but mad junk in 
[01:01:00]  there.  Speak up.  And they're playing, they're playing Boy George.  They're playing music like this in a locker room.  Man, locker room.  Oh, there you live.  One locker room you're going to.  Yeah, it's a crowded house first of all.  And what locker room are you going into where they're playing game music?  I'd love to know.  You would, Jimmy.  Just cheer me up.  And when did Jar Jar Binks get a radio show?  Mesa don't like the locker room.  Mesa hate Boy George. 
[01:01:30]  George, they're playing music like this in a locker room.  Man's locker room.  He ain't lying.  I swear to God.  He ain't lying.  I swear to effing God.  Preach on, brother.  I swear to effing God, they were playing Boy George in the locker room.  And a bunch of men said, hey, how was the football game?  And then their dogs are all just out.  They're naked.  I never understood that.  Their what is out?  Their dogs?  Dongs.  Dongs.  Their dogs?  Dong?  Yeah.  The donger.  The dog.  The donger. 
[01:02:00]  The what?  Their dogs?  Yeah.  Dongs.  That's how he said it, though.  Dongs.  Long duck dong.  All right.  Well, here's Gay Locker Room Part 2.  The Marco and Aaron Show.  Dude, I walk into the locker room and I swear to God.  There literally are guys butt naked holding up.  It looked like they were going to party, dude.  I swear to God.  It was like, you can see the old man is moving around.  The six flags old man naked. 
[01:02:30]  They're slapping each other with the towels, having fun.  It was yay.  It was so bad.  Whoa, wow.  That is awesome.  And the music doesn't even fit.  That's my new favorite radio show.  It really is.  That's all I want to hear from now on.  The Marco and Aaron Show.  Marco and Aaron.  The locker room.  It's MNAShow.com.  MNAShow.com.  And they have plenty of other bits online that I can go through a few. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  We need more.  And now a daily feature.  We need more.  Hey, can we get pictures of those guys up?  They have more stuff we could listen to today?  Yeah, I can go through it today.  Yeah, give me more Marco and Aaron.  A golden ticket hopeful.  That's their selection.  That's their selection of clips.  Jacking off to the Special Olympics.  Crimes that races do.  Damn honkies. 
[01:03:30]  Vietnamese man calls.  Yeah, get us more of the Marco and Aaron Show.  Who's the one with the wacky voice?  Marco or Aaron?  I don't know.  I'm going to assume it's Marco.  Polo.  It just sounds like a Marco.  Marco polio.  Polio.  Oh, that was the gag.  Oh, that's classic.  Let's go to Ron in Jersey.  Ron, go ahead.  Hey, I'm wondering what bit they're going to do next.  Are they going to do knock-knock jokes?  Knock-knock.  Who's there? 
[01:04:00]  Olive.  Olive.  Oh, it's Jar Jar Binks doing radio.  John in Rockland.  What's up?  John.  Hey.  Oh, Sean.  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, sorry, Sean.  You've got to compare that audio to the Terrence and Phillip audio from South Park.  Sounds identical.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  It does sound very similar.  So that's Marco and Aaron, a golden ticket hopeful.  And now we're going to listen to the Nick and George show. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I have no idea where these guys are from.  Nick and George.  It sounds like it's either a podcast or just internet.  Yeah.  Because there's nothing online that I could find, and they didn't send any information.  No websites.  You Googled them and found nothing.  That's great.  That's where you want to be.  I give these guys a lot of credit.  Under the radar.  I give these guys a lot of credit.  They're sending their stuff in, though.  Yeah.  You never know, right?  You never know.  Maybe we do a goof hour and give all these guys, you know, air time. 
[01:05:00]  Here's some audio from the Nick and George show talking about a hairy ass.  Well, everyone complained because apparently everyone thinks I have a hairy ass now, which I do.  It don't make you a bad person.  It doesn't make me a bad person.  You have a hairy ass.  He has a hairy leather cheerio.  You better believe it.  His balloon knot is...  It's like a jungle out there.  Welcome to the jungle!  Oh, okay.  I was trying to have a laugh. 
[01:05:30]  Hold on.  I've been hanging out with Anthony for, I think we're up to ten years.  Yeah.  Jimmy, at least three or four now.  We haven't seen each other's hairy asses, I feel.  It's time.  Answers, Harrier.  Yours has more of a wispy tinge.  Little blondish red hairs tickling the bag.  Oh, stop!  Makes for a medley of sweat and laughs.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Oh. 
[01:06:00]  What?  Oh, God.  Can you rewind, like, five seconds where he sings Welcome to the Jungle?  That's like an improv that I kind of liked.  Yeah, that was really good.  All right.  That is cringeworthy.  What's good with an improv is if somebody mentions something and you sing a song that has that  word in it.  Right.  It's like a jungle out there.  Welcome to the jungle!  But, uh, no, because I had that during the show, my shirt was off and I had the hair  on the base of my spine. 
[01:06:30]  So people came up to me after the show and just went, wow, you must have a tremendously  hairy ass.  I was like, wow, thank you.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  It was just your mom that said that, though.  And.  Yeah.  Georgie.  Yes, not to you, Harry.  Georgie, let me shave that, Georgie.  Oh, God.  Georgie, come over here.  Georgie.  Get over here.  Let me shave your ass.  You can embarrass yourself. 
[01:07:00]  I like that Welcome to the Jungle.  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  Another clip from the Nick and George show.  Brave enough to send in their stuff.  Hoping for a golden ticket.  They're, uh, talking about Halloween here.  I didn't do a lot, like, I didn't go around and, like, egg people's house and stuff.  Maybe, like, one year I threw some toilet paper around.  I know.  I was a bad boy.  Maybe that was my freshman year.  But, like, as soon as I could drive, me and two of my other friends, we went out.  Oh, God. 
[01:07:30]  We each had cars.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  So, we went around and we grabbed pumpkins from people's.  Nah.  We, well, we kind of stole, but not really.  Okay.  So, we grabbed, we, and then we'd meet back at one spot.  You hear, like, I go, Nick.  We'd drop off these pumpkins.  Yeah.  And then we'd come back and go around again.  It was, like, in front of us.  How many pumpkins did you pile up?  We wound up getting 50 pumpkins, about 50 pumpkins.  Wow.  In one spot.  And then we, we took them all, and then we just went to some random person's house and 
[01:08:00]  just put them, we didn't smash them.  We just littered them all over his drive, this guy's driveway, his, his door pad.  Imagine opening your door and just saying,  Oh, my God.  Sweetheart, did you get the mail?  I'll get it.  Is it pumpkins?  That's the same reaction you have when your child comes out with downs. 
[01:08:30]  Let's say hi to Steve in New York.  Go ahead, Steve.  I just want to say that that's gay, not funny.  This isn't gay, not funny voting.  I'm saying gay or not.  Although he's right.  Yeah.  That was really gay.  I don't know.  That guy's crazy, though, man.  Like, a bunch of pumpkins in the driveway.  If I came, I'd probably go, what's going on?  Yeah.  All right.  We have one more clip from the Nick and George show, talking about puberty here.  Ah. 
[01:09:00]  There's a time and a place for these things.  Puberty almost caught up with me yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A guy with a shirt that said puberty started chasing me down the street.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, he came out of nowhere.  That bastard.  You know how horrible that would have been?  I already went through it three times.  I know.  I hate the puberty guy.  Yeah.  He just starts running at you, and then you don't know what to do.  I got upset.  He tackles you.  Yeah.  He brought me to the ground.  How many times do you want me to go through this? 
[01:09:30]  Three times, apparently.  I think they keep forgetting my face.  Yeah.  So they keep putting me down on the list to get tackled.  Yeah.  And it's just, it's not fun.  I have one of those faces that's easy to forget.  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Good thing he eluded the man in the puberty shirt because the man in the dullard shirt tackled  him. 
[01:10:00]  Wow.  Well, that is so bad.  Yeah.  That is such bad radio.  Did you hear the one guy scold the other guy?  Nick.  Oh, boy.  You minister of morons.  I'm feeling pretty good about myself today.  Here's another clip.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  All right.  Well.  Oh, Nick.  Well.  Well, there's two things going on here. 
[01:10:30]  The Marco and Aaron show is so bad we want to hear more.  Right.  That's obvious, right?  How could both shows be really bad but one you want to hear more of and the other you  just want to perish in a fire at the studio?  One has an impediment.  And the Nick and George show just needs to go away.  Yeah.  It's the Nick and George show.  The Nick and George show.  So, Travis, thank you.  Pumpkins and puberty shirts.  Yes. 
[01:11:00]  Could you get us more of the Marco and Aaron show before we end the show today?  Absolutely.  Marco and Aaron show.  Fucking deaf idiot trying to do radio.  My co-host was killed today crossing the street.  Fuck you and your speech impediment.  Mush mouth.  I don't think we'll be handing out any golden tickets today.  No, it's looking a little...  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  Any day we can just hand out another golden ticket.  You know that.  Any day.  Any day.  Oh, look at that. 
[01:11:30]  Look at that.  A winner.  Look at that.  I want to hear the Marco and Steve C show.  Do you think that in February?  I don't really know.  What are you even saying?  How frustrated Steve would get?  Don't even...  I can't even do Steve.  Sure you can.  We can all do Steve.  Everyone does.  Just sound like a pompous ass.  Enunciate everything.  Enunciate every single syllable.  Make everything sound important.  Yes.  All right.  Before we go to break, we should say hi to Tim from Springfield.  Tim, come on in here, man.  He's a lanky boy.  Tim from Springfield.  Let me explain, Tim. 
[01:12:00]  Is it Springfield to the new listeners?  We're doing this contest called the Assault on the Media.  We love the Assault on the Media contest.  Yes.  Every month we have fine prizes up for grabs.  Basically, we're looking for our pests to get out there and get in front of live shots.  Get behind live shots, get in front of live shots, wear costumes, use air horns.  We don't care.  Just get our attention and get our names out there.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  And the best one of the month wins fine prizes.  Tim was the best one for the month of July. 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  And he won a MiFi courtesy of MyRadioStore.com.  Was he Cape Guy?  Yes, from Springfield.  Yes, of course.  I mean, you're a star now, man.  I'm looking at you like you're a celebrity because I've seen the video online a million times.  I've seen this guy.  Thank you, boys.  And, yeah, he did a great one.  He ran behind a reporter in Springfield with a cape and had perfect, perfect, perfect delivery.  And he said it right.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  The winning video is up on.  Paper off.  Very nice. 
[01:13:00]  OpieandAnthony.com and FoundryMusic.com.  Here's the audio really fast.  Yeah, let's hear them.  Well, the chief has a hurdle to overcome.  Today, she went before the city's retirement board.  What she wants the board to do is to increase her compensation annually,  the retirement compensation from $109,000 a year to nearly $150,000.  Well, the chief was successful in one suspect today.  I love this video because the reporter, an older guy, didn't know what to do. 
[01:13:30]  He just turns around, and now the mic is right in Tim's face for him to say it again.  Yeah.  He sounded like Wall of Voodoo.  Opie and Anthony on XM Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  They're on XM Radio.  Even got an Opie and Anthony are back.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  I had a strategy to it, which was risky.  It was to go at the end of the month rather than the beginning of the month,  which you could miss a shot.  And I have an idea for next month. 
[01:14:00]  It's all ready to go.  I don't want to give it away over the air.  No, don't.  This is the costume I'm going for.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  Very nice.  That'll work.  Very good.  Oh, Jesus.  Very good.  Yeah.  I like that.  I mean, anyone out there that wants to do this, you have a day off.  You take dedication to it, and it's a winner.  It is so much fun to watch the videos online.  And the prizes are going to get better as we go along here.  Because, I mean, how many MIFIs can you win there, Tim, you know?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, how about one of those little cushions for your seat?  Ooh.  I think that we have to have a rule. 
[01:14:30]  If somebody is lucky enough to win it twice,  there might have to be some kind of prize amendment, no?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Yes.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Ooh.  Thank you, Eric.  Oh, Eric just handed him a seat cushion.  You want two or three more?  You can put them in your wallet.  That is a seat cushion, my friend.  A marketing masterpiece.  You put these on the seat, and then your asshole sees the XM.  Perfect.  They should take everybody that thought that up, put them in a closed room with a bunch  of those, and light them on fire, because I'm sure the toxic fumes would kill you in a second. 
[01:15:00]  Well, the key to product placement when you're marketing something is to make sure you put  it where absolutely no one will see it.  I understand there's the new marketing idea for XM insignia on pacemakers.  That's a brilliant one.  This way, anyone that happens to open your chest just thinks of satellite radio.  And goes, hmm, I could use that.  I like the XM tampons that are coming out soon.  Yeah.  I brought gifts, Opie, in October when I heard that you guys are back on the air.  Yeah.  Actually, the reason I heard you was Jimmy Norton here, which I haven't heard of because 
[01:15:30]  I was an AF listener.  I really didn't get the NAW signal.  So, he was on Last Comic Standing.  He was wearing the T-shirt.  Next day, I ran out and bought XM.  Nice.  I went out to a T-shirt place, and I made these.  Ooh.  I have one for all of you.  Oh, wow.  I like that a lot, actually.  I give these away to anyone that I wear the shirt around Springfield.  Anyone comes up to me and goes, I give them one.  It's absolutely free.  Anyone that wants one.  Remember Springfield.  Large trophy.  I love you.  I got an XL for Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  Oh.  It's a great T-shirt.  It's a great T-shirt with our Opie and Anthony XM satellite radio logo. 
[01:16:00]  Right on the front.  Oh, yes.  It's your birthday, Jimmy.  My birthday gift.  I like that a lot, actually.  And you're handing them out all over Springfield.  At Springfield?  Absolutely.  Easy, Marco.  It's contagious.  Springfield.  The point where I'm.  All the Aleve.  Are kicking in for the sore neck.  But, yeah, Tim, you're the winner.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  You're going to be hanging out all day and checking out the show and all that, right?  And we have an early leader for the month of August. 
[01:16:30]  It's the guy with the lion costume from Alabama.  I don't think anyone's going to beat him.  That's a good one.  It's kind of a drag as far as a contest goes.  Because the first day of the month, this guy just hits hard and good.  Real good.  Is he yelling in this clip?  Eric?  Yeah, you hear him a little bit.  Steven, the lion man versus NBC 12 in Auburn, Alabama.  This is the movie scene, right?  Yeah, this is the leader for the month of August.  Assault in the media contest.  All the rules are up on openingathlete.com. 
[01:17:00]  You can do pretty much anything.  Just don't touch the reporter is what we're asking.  Here's Dolores Keith.  Dolores?  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Of course, there are a lot of great reasons why people love Auburn.  Now, most parents with school-age children love it because of its great public school system.  Obviously, the video much better because the guy's in a lion costume.  And I think he's ripping off tips.  He's ripping off your delivery.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Radio.  Radio. 
[01:17:30]  Your voice is crackling a little there, too.  Oh, P and Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, there was about a 40-yard dash to the camera without him seeing me.  So, I was almost out of breath by the time I got there.  He's trying to be discreet with a cape.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had my coat on.  And at the last minute, you just rip the coat off.  My wife's on the phone.  You tell her you're going.  Yeah.  That's it.  I love hearing the behind-the-scenes stuff.  Yeah.  Because you've got to set it up with somebody else at home because they've got to let you  know when to go.  Oh, yeah.  Very hard to do by yourself because you don't know when they're going live. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  You see it on your TV at home.  They call you.  Right.  You're in.  Very good.  Good job.  Also, in the month of August, we had the guy in St. Louis with the Howard Stern mask.  Yeah, that was good.  It was two guys, wasn't it?  Yeah, but they weren't on camera long enough to...  The cameraman was on to him and went real tight on the reporter.  And then when he went wide, they jumped into the picture, but they went to the tape right  away.  It was kind of a clusterfuck, but you could see him in a still picture.  They could have taken down Lion Man, but they just didn't get the job done, unfortunately.  That's how it works. 
[01:18:30]  It was a good one, though.  It had a lot of potential.  There is some luck involved.  And then we had a guy with an air horn, but the air horn was on for like a half a second.  He almost blew Lion Man away as well.  So we'll see what happens.  It's the Assault on the Media contest happening every month.  And the month of August, we have another MyFi to give away, courtesy of MyRadioStore.com  and some other fine prizes, including dinner at Paisano's on Mulberry Street in the heart  of Little Italy.  You come in and see the show, maybe some comedy at the Comedy Cellar, and you get the seat 
[01:19:00]  cushion.  Yeah.  All right.  And a cup of coffee.  I'm buying some coffee for our friend...  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Look at that.  I'd like a medium iced latte with skim milk or whatever this young buck is having.  Can I get a tall...  Not you.  You're the strapping buck.  He's the young buck.  What would you like?  I don't know.  What are you getting, Jim?  Medium iced latte with skim milk.  That sounds good.  All right.  Make it two in whatever the boss is having.  Sweetie?  Can I get a tall ice with milk? 
[01:19:30]  Tall ice.  I'd put the W slash.  Holy...  Hook?  I'm good.  Thank you.  All right.  Jim is buying for everyone.  Oh, cut it out.  Muffin and something?  I want a low-fat apple thing.  I love those.  They're so tasty, and they make the whole studio smell nice, don't they?  Like apples.  It is.  I hate your apple cake.  I'd like a piece...  It's wonderful. 
[01:20:00]  I hate it.  I'd like a piece of low-fat apple cake, too.  Oh, Jimmy, join me.  Won't you?  Two men having some apple cake.  How about you, strapping tall fella?  Would you like some apple cake?  I'll try one.  Three pieces of low-fat.  Not that you need to worry, Tim.  No, I know.  There you are.  Hold on.  If that's not enough, just chip in, and I'll give it to you as soon as you get back.  You want me to use my Starbucks card?  No.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, you got them really bad.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  That's just awful.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Tim, hang out, have fun, all right? 
[01:20:30]  Awesome.  Tim from Springfield joining us today, and what's this?  Yeah, we'll play that going into break.  When we get back, we've got to talk about the priest.  We've got to get into some real radio.  Yes, we do.  Beauty and the priest.  This story in New York is just massive.  Massive.  And there's one more media race incident I'd like to discuss.  Of course, the reporting.  Yes.  All right, we'll do that.  And also, the jerk-off at the baseball game.  Absolutely hilarious story.  And he's the star of the day. 
[01:21:00]  And the Hubble photograph of your cock in this photo, which, good job, Danny, looking right at the crotch.  Yeah, Danny, he noticed it.  Didn't you notice Opie's crotch in the publicity shot?  Yeah.  He's smiling.  Opie, you got bad luck on publicity photos.  Yours flies down on Demented World.  I know.  Did you fly down?  Yeah.  Did you mean to do that on Demented World?  Yeah, I was doing some subliminal thing.  Ah.  This year, fly, is not down.  However, nothing can keep the public from seeing that large gift. 
[01:21:30]  Jesus.  I wonder if Ben's been hiding in the office.  That's all he had going for him on this show, is that big cock.  I don't know what the hell's going on in this publicity photo.  It's absolutely...  Absolutely.  Because it looks...  Actually, it looks like a miniature dick.  That's hard.  Your zipper is down.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, it does.  It looks like one that's soft and just can't be contained by Speedos.  Not to get too graphic with this.  No, I don't know about...  I don't know what the hell's going on there. 
[01:22:00]  What do you think, Dan?  I don't even know what the hell's going on there.  You're the one that found it.  You discovered it.  I noticed it because it looked like he just had his hand in his pocket.  I thought he was doing it on purpose.  That's not why you noticed it.  You noticed it because you were looking where my head was at the level,  and you were thinking, lucky Jim.  You're right.  I was just trying to cover it up.  Do you guys think that's really my ball bag?  It's like a doggy bone in your pants.  Is that my ball bag, you think?  I don't know.  I've never seen your bag.  It's hanging quite far to one side, though.  I know.  Something doesn't make sense in this photo.  Was it stuck to your leg? 
[01:22:30]  Maybe.  Some fruit roll-up sack?  That's the worst.  You've got to peel it off.  Yeah.  Smells like armpit.  You ever rub your finger between your bag and your leg,  and it smells like a pit?  Oh!  That's sour.  You've got to touch your tongue like a battery.  Oh, God.  You don't do that.  Of course you do.  It's your own.  No.  Was that the same photographer that took that original picture that photoshopped your neck?  No.  No.  No, that guy doesn't take photos.  Maybe that was a little retribution.  If you get a little itch right there where your sack just about meets your body, 
[01:23:00]  and you pinch the itch right between your thumb and forefinger and kind of roll a little bit,  you can understand why a dog makes that face and tries to scratch himself with pleasure.  Doesn't that feel good?  It feels great.  It feels wonderful.  Can we throw this publicity photo up online and have the listeners comment about it?  Sure.  I'm sure they'll have some real nice things to say, but I'll throw myself under the bus today.  Oh, but did you have these braids?  Did you have these for real, or is this a goof for the cover?  That's a goof.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  Are you insane? 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  You guys had a lot of hair.  You guys were weird back then.  We were very weird.  I just had a lot of rubber bands in my hair for the cover of Demented World.  They wanted us to look Demented, Jim.  See?  It's Demented World, so we had to look crazy.  Insane.  So we all looked crazy.  It's no yellow discipline or trinkets made from gorilla hands.  Trinkets I own.  I own.  Trinkets I own.  Yeah, why didn't you fucking put out an album that you can't even remember?  I know, I know.  Why did you pick a name that I can't even remember? 
[01:24:00]  Because.  I'm a huge Jimmy Norton fan.  I don't even know what it's called.  Because it was, the idea for that came from a piece of artwork that somebody sent me unsolicited,  and that gave me the idea just to do a fan work.  But why?  Just call it pedophile.  Something easy to remember.  Call it physical graffiti.  Close to your heart.  Physical graffiti.  Hey, so, yeah, here's the deal.  Let's set the stage here.  Tim from Springfield, the winner of the Salt on the Media contest.  He's hanging out for the rest of the morning.  He won for the month of July. 
[01:24:30]  Every month we do that contest.  My cock will be up on the websites for you guys to check out.  The brand new publicity photo that was taken.  There's something going on there.  We don't know what.  And Jimmy has two comedy CDs that are available on eatabullet.com.  Oh, you got a picture with Kenison, dude?  I'm jealous.  Oh, yeah, I got one.  Shit.  That's a biggie.  That's a biggie, right?  How young were you?  Strapping little fella.  I was working with Brother Weez.  I was just like an intern, just getting Weez.  Oh, he did Weez's show. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  He used to do Weez's show all the time.  And then here's a great photo of Anthony.  Oh, that's Maureen McCormick.  That's Marsha Brady.  Marsha Brady.  And Rocky Dennis.  You look like Rocky Dennis in that photo.  What?  That's not a flattering picture of you at all.  Why?  Let me see.  Take a look at you and Maureen McCormick.  And hey, you should be pulling pins out of the map.  Wow.  I got a big head.  It's the way the hair is parted around the side.  I got a big jawline.  And then we have a picture of Anthony and I with Rodney Dangerfield.  The looks on our faces are priceless because we're convinced the guy's going to die any 
[01:25:30]  day.  And that was held on there for quite a while.  We held on for another almost 10 years.  Cool Kinnison picture.  I love the Kinnison picture.  I was just a young go-getter for Brother Weez and had the opportunity to meet Sam Kinnison.  I met him once.  I got him to sign a napkin.  I'm glad I did that.  But I should have done it.  I didn't do pictures back then.  Still have it?  Yes.  And I'll never forget that day.  Kinnison was awesome.  He was nice, right?  He was amazing.  Did I ever tell you about my Groucho autograph? 
[01:26:00]  Of course I did.  Of course.  You got that on the set of Day at the Races?  I don't even have it.  All right.  So when we get back, we're going to talk about the priest.  We're going to talk about the guy that did something pretty wacky at...  Was it a Yankee game?  Yeah, it was a Yankee game.  And also the killer snakehead fish all on the way.  Oh, over here, yeah.  Oh, over here, yeah.  Oh!  Oh, great.  I'm Tony Schoenker.  I'm Tony Schoenker.  I'm Tony Scott.  Dr. Gordon with 60 guys.  We're going back.  Spare the 50. 
[01:26:30]  Some exit.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  How about that woman that said the shirt off?  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Show us your funding.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, this is fantastic.  This sounds beautiful.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Cancel your appointment.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday.  Stay out the bushes.  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday.  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday.  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday. 
[01:27:30]  It's Wimper Mal Wednesday.  And Anthony here.  XM-202.  I realize your mind.  I realize your mind.  Oh, Jimmy missed his favorite song. 
[01:28:00]  Jimmy, I like how Jimmy's like three years behind the curve on new music.  He's like, what is this song? I really like it.  It's a three-year-old song, stupid.  Queens of the Stone Age, you ass.  That's a good one.  I heard, what was that, New Disturbed we added into the little rotation there?  You like it?  Yeah, nothing beats that first one, though.  I'm loving Ethel lately.  First Disturbed album was great.  They got that Ethel all figured out. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, it's my favorite station on XM.  Ethel.  I love the Dandy Warhols.  The Dandy Warhols?  They have a song called Smoke It. I can't get enough of it.  I go between Ethel and Top Tracks.  Top Tracks, sure.  Or your, you know, your classics.  And then the Ethel.  Where is little Jimmy Norton?  Probably kneeling in front of a perfectly round hole in the side of one of the bathroom stalls.  I was just handed a CD. 
[01:29:00]  Call center phone sex guy hitting on girls and having them masturbate and stuff.  What?  We're going to have to go to the bottom of this.  This was something that Steve emailed me overnight and said it's pretty good audio.  It's pretty good audio.  So we'll check that out.  We should get into some kind of news.  Some kind of current events.  We try to do current events on this program.  A guy jumps into Yankee Stadium.  Foul pole net.  This is on the front page of two out of the three papers here in New York City.  Foul pole net? 
[01:29:30]  Isn't it the back?  Wasn't it behind the home plate?  Behind home plate.  Huh?  It was the netting behind home plate.  Yeah.  All right.  It's different than a foul pole net, isn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, what's that, Nathaniel?  No.  What?  I don't know.  He was giving me hand signals.  I think he was doing the universal sign of I love you.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's the problem, Jimmy?  No, no.  You're not allowed to ever leave this studio.  No, no, no.  It's just amazing how fast the brakes are. 
[01:30:00]  I literally just walked in, took a leak, and it was back on the air.  Where'd you leak?  The old studio?  No, I pee quite a long time.  I'd stand there with my prostate.  With somebody else next to you with a luscious cock that you just had a look at?  How do you pee with a rod?  No, but I pee, and then little drops just come out.  Really?  Well, yeah, when I'm done peeing, I have to feel like I have to pee.  Oh, it's got to be totally done, or else you get the yellow stain.  You've got to do the vicious shake.  No, you can't do the yank or the vicious shake.  The vicious shake.  Smacking it on the side of the urinal. 
[01:30:30]  No, you've got to be patient with your penis.  Let it just drip.  All right, Fall Guy, front page of the New York Post and New York Newsday.  Daredevil tumbles into Stadium Net.  I'm sure they're showing the video all over the country today.  Yeah, they don't have him falling.  They just have it afterwards.  Oh, really?  Right after he landed in the net, it's him with his head in his hands, kind of shaking it off.  Apparently, he was way up there, upper deck, about 50 feet above this netting. 
[01:31:00]  And he was with a bunch of his friends from high school.  They're starting to think they were drinking.  And he's known for doing crazy stuff.  So he's talking to his friends, going, you think I could make that?  You think I'd be okay?  You think it'll hold me?  And his friends are like, I don't know, dude.  You know, it goes back and forth.  He's standing there, and he was starting to annoy the people behind him,  because they were missing the game because this guy's standing in front of them, in front of everybody.  And they were getting pissed and started saying, look, either sit down or jump. 
[01:31:30]  New York, of course.  Of course.  And then they said he just flung himself over the edge.  And they were like, wow, holy shit, he jumped.  And he landed in the netting.  Now, this netting isn't, it's not a trapeze netting or something.  It does look like it could be one of those circuit nets.  What?  Or trapeze.  Circuit net?  Circus?  Did I say circus?  Circuit net.  Yeah.  Circuit net.  Circus net or trapeze net.  The light went out.  Check the circus breakers. 
[01:32:00]  No, it's made out of, like, cable.  It's pretty hardcore stuff.  Not soft.  And he landed in it and apparently injured himself enough to be taken to the hospital.  But he did it because he didn't fall.  He actually jumped because he wanted to make the ESPN highlight reel.  That's what he said.  And they don't even have video of it?  They don't have video of it.  Oh, my God.  You do something like that and all they have is him sitting in the net with a hole in the net where I guess his ass hit.  He is very lucky he didn't go right through the goddamn thing and land on somebody underneath him. 
[01:32:30]  And they kind of put out a little pole for him.  And he grabbed onto that and they pulled him in and it looked like they were just ready to tune him up.  And ready to just beat the crap out of him.  Took him to the hospital.  And then he was hauled away by police this morning.  Apparently it worked.  Everyone's hearing his name this morning.  His pictures are on the cover of all the newspapers.  So he's gotten his little fame for the moment. 
[01:33:00]  His little 15 minutes of fame, man?  That's how much they give you.  And, you know, who knows?  You think you might end up on a couple of talk shows and probably do some radio.  He'll be all over the place.  Maybe Conan.  What were you thinking when you did that?  That's exactly what I was going to say.  I've got to ask you, what was going through your head?  He'll be on Letterman.  Why were you doing this?  Scott Harper, 18, took his pals there and dived from the upper deck of Yankee Stadium into the netting behind home plate last night, stopping the game for four minutes.  That's classic. 
[01:33:30]  Steinbrenner's pissed.  He was saying it was the most exciting thing that happened at the stadium last night because he's all pissed at the Yankees for losing last night.  He'll be on Letterman or something.  Yeah.  Although I doubt he'll be made to go on a Friday like comedians are.  I'm sure he'll get a Monday slot.  Ah, and won't be bumped.  No, yeah, I doubt he'll be bumped.  He'll probably be first leading guest.  Better.  No, no, why would it be?  I mean, a guy jumps on the net.  Yeah.  He should be first guest.  I hear, actually, he was in the secret room yesterday looking at gadgets that XM was putting. 
[01:34:00]  Now, here's the question I have, Anthony.  Yes?  If he had an Opie and Anthony sign, that would have won the Assault on the Media contest.  Are you kidding me?  For the year.  For the month of August.  It would have been a year.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You'd have gotten 12 prizes.  12 prizes, yeah.  Absolutely.  Front page like that with a huge Opie and Anthony sign.  Oh.  As the guy in the net.  Hey, I do believe you would have won the contest.  How great would that be?  For a radio show stunt promotion.  They wouldn't say our name. 
[01:34:30]  Who cares?  Yeah.  We would know, and we would laugh hard.  All right.  Did you ever have audio the announcements or anything?  Was there any announcers?  Yeah, they just kind of were like, whoa, hey, what's that?  There's a happy young fan.  It's high.  Let us fly.  They try to ignore those things so it doesn't happen in the future.  Yeah.  Like streakers or somebody running out on the field or falling.  You can tell when the camera gets pushed way over to one side and doesn't make any sense  and the announcers are silent.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  Well, they didn't ignore this guy, though.  No.  They put a camera right on him.  It's like, uh-oh, how are they going to get him down?  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  You're going to see some copycat events now.  Copycats.  Why is Jim just allowed to walk out and take phone calls?  Because he's fancy and special.  He can leave the show whenever he darn well pleases.  Hey, look at that.  It's gaffing him.  He just abandons his post like a coward.  It amazes me that the radio show is truly secondary to Jim Norton's life. 
[01:35:30]  He doesn't really care.  Get up right now and just make a phone call.  Just leave.  Just leave.  He didn't even say anything.  No.  Like he was going.  He just gets up and leaves.  Sometimes he just leaves to check email.  Where did he go?  You can't just leave your post.  He'd be great in the Army, wouldn't he?  Who's holding off the front?  Ah, Jimmy Norton.  Where did he go?  Ah, he had to take a leak or something. 
[01:36:00]  What?  It's about his couch that he's getting delivered.  And he wanted, we were going to send one of the interns to his house today to wait  because he was only going to get delivered during the show.  Yeah.  So we were going to have one of the interns go over because he wants it in a certain spot  and everything.  But that fell through.  So now he's out there.  He's like, I confirm this.  And he's going, actually, it would be funny if he was in here doing it on there.  Please don't tell me that he's going to leave today's program so he could get a couch  for his couch.  When it's delivered, you move it.  If it's not exactly where you're going to go.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Uh-oh. 
[01:36:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  It's fucking never easy, man.  It's never easy in life.  What happened?  My sofa's being delivered today.  Two months ago, I ordered it.  Ben is so happy right now.  But it's amazing how nothing gets done.  Nothing.  Fucking life.  Nothing gets done correctly.  What was supposed to happen?  Originally, they called me for a scheduled delivery.  I say, look, I'm on the air until 11 a.m.  I have an acting class tonight at 6. 
[01:37:00]  So, yeah, you know, you might as well start a month before you go to L.A.  So, can you come after 11, between 11 and 6?  We can't guarantee that, but we'll try.  I get a call.  You're scheduled between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.  That's not within the parameters.  Can't do it.  And that's why we were going to have Clayton or one of these guys wait at my apartment for  the delivery people if I couldn't reschedule.  So, I call them back.  The lady was very nice, Maria, for room and board, place in Soho that my gay friend took  me to, and I know, I know, very good, and, uh, oh, no, what happened now? 
[01:37:30]  He's trying to tell a story.  Go ahead, Jim.  And I'm so bored with the story in general, I picked up my blackjack and I'm starting to  read the email.  I'm enjoying Jimmy's story because it just shows that there's garbage working out there.  Now, what, what was the problem now?  Um, well, I, I, I was, I just, you know. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, this cake is delicious, Jimmy.  Is it?  Have a piece.  Here we go.  Here's the cake.  It's a fork full of smile.  Fucking mind-boggling.  Mind-boggling.  Are there savages involved?  What happened, Jimmy? 
[01:38:30]  I want to know what happened, though.  All right, the intern's supposed to be over to accept delivery.  Where's this problem now?  Uh, with the, it was with the, uh...  He is so fucking distracted.  He is ready to either kill himself or kill somebody else.  Fuck shit out.  You're just not hungry anymore?  I'm just annoyed.  Not that you put something down, that happens, but, you know...  So now why can't the intern be there and the couch gets over? 
[01:39:00]  Oh, because I called back and, uh, rescheduled it for noon to three.  The lady was very nice.  And she's like, yeah, yeah, that's what I understand.  We'll make it, like, one of the later stops.  Mm-hmm.  So I just get a call from security in my building.  Oh, no.  Uh, do you have a furniture delivery?  And it's just like they're there.  At a quarter to, uh, nine?  Yeah.  So I call the guy.  I say, can you put the guy on the phone, please?  And I tell him, look, you're not supposed to be here until after I spoke to Maria. 
[01:39:30]  And you're not supposed to be there.  It's supposed to be noon to three.  He goes, oh, we had you first.  And I know it's probably going to get fixed, but it's just aggravating.  You can never in life just make a phone call and have things taken care of.  Does anybody, just, does anything ever work smoothly?  No.  You know what happens when I'm scheduled to go on at 9.40 at the cellar?  I fucking get there and I go on at 9.40.  Give the people what they want.  Yes.  A fucking self-indulgent 20-minute horse shit set. 
[01:40:00]  Oh.  As tired as I am, I know I walk in at 5 to 7.  We got to be on the air from 7 to 11.  I don't walk in at 8.30.  I don't get here at 5 in the morning.  For some reason, people can't get shit right these days.  There is nothing that, when you order something or you need something done, you just expect  it to go awry.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Oh, it's just irritating.  Because I didn't want to stay home and miss the show today. 
[01:40:30]  Obviously, I can't.  And I would have had the intern stay there and make sure the floors are okay.  You don't just have them come up and...  And now I'm thinking I should have just let them go up and put it there because now they're  not going to come back.  Big scratches on your nice wood floor.  Yeah, I got to wait until they come back.  Well, we have to reschedule it.  Do you really?  For when?  God, I hate dealing with...  I fucking hate dealing with people.  Is it a fancy couch?  It sure is.  Big and cushy for a boy to enjoy TV on.  Nice.  Will it sponge off easy?  No, I didn't even get the extra... 
[01:41:00]  They were going to put some...  Scotchgard?  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  What about the jism?  Please, who cares?  I'll just have it cleaned off.  I'll have somebody with a hyphen in their last name just come and clean it.  Come on, lady.  Exactly.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul, go ahead.  Jimmy gets his couch on time.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  There you go.  Jimmy gets his couch on time.  But everybody has to deal with this crap when you got to go...  You got to go to...  You know, you have to stay home from work and do something. 
[01:41:30]  There's times where you can't, so you go through the trouble of rescheduling and they  confirm it.  And it's just...  Is there any reason shit has to be scheduled in an 8- to 10-hour window for a fucking couch?  No.  For a couch?  As soon as we go on break, I'm going to call the lady and just make sure all is well.  You mean to tell me they can't look at what they got to put on a truck, look at a map,  and see about how long something...  Narrow it down to even two hours. 
[01:42:00]  Two fucking hours.  Ten hours.  They want you to wait.  Unbelievable.  Well, this is between 8 and 11 a.m.  That was the window.  They actually gave a three-hour window.  They did?  And then the later window was between noon and three.  Yeah, call up like cable or something like that.  So just be there between this week and next month.  Yeah, exactly.  August 2008.  Let's go to Ken in Jersey.  Ken, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, was that a Yankee game once?  Yeah.  And this guy, he went on that net and just kind of watched two innings of baseball. 
[01:42:30]  They wouldn't come out and get him.  You know, they wanted him to get off, but he's like, no, I'm not going.  Yeah, he didn't jump though.  He came off and they pummeled him.  He stepped onto the net.  The best way to do that is just to shoot him out of it.  Oh, that'd be great.  They stopped the game for like five minutes, and then they said, screw it, we're going  to keep playing.  They kept playing.  The interest got lost in the guy.  He came off, and then they beat the crap out of him.  Just hope a foul ball clocks him right on the head.  Yeah, yeah.  All right. 
[01:43:00]  Thank you, sir.  Someone has a good point for you here, Jimmy.  Tommy in Brooklyn.  Tommy?  Yeah.  What's up?  How are you guys?  Listen, Jimmy, do you understand that every time they make a delivery, they're going  to have to take your couch out, put it on the street, pull out their delivery,  then throw your couch back in.  Dude, I...  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Dude, shut up.  You have a little experience in this, right, Tommy?  You better tell Jimmy what's going to happen to his couch, his really nice, cushy couch.  It's time to order.  I got to call the show. 
[01:43:30]  It's over.  I'm out.  Just a couple of goddamn apes throwing your couch off the back of the truck.  I fucking hate everybody.  I hate dealing with people.  Of course.  Fucking phone's busy.  You're right.  It's a good point, though.  Oh, my God.  But what am I supposed to do?  Can you have them...  You can't just tell them to go up there and leave it, because if they have to move something,  if there's something in the way, they're just going to scrape it across the floor.  Well, you know what? 
[01:44:00]  Of course they will.  Ah.  Of course they will.  They'll scrape your floor up.  That has to be carried the entire way and placed down lightly, perhaps on little plastic  caster things.  I know that guy makes a great point.  I know that's what's going to happen.  It's going to get all chipped up and fucked up.  You know, yeah, your legs are going to be all wobbly now.  The legs on the couch.  Because you know they're going to kind of toss it sort of to the side.  Dude, just not a big toss, but just enough, like a half a foot. 
[01:44:30]  But what will happen is you're going to get little street pebbles in the bottom of the  feet, and then when you put it down on your wood floor, it's going to make, like, just  these scratches all over the floor.  Yeah, that could be a real problem.  I'm thinking ants.  Baboons just throwing cushions around, hitting each other with the cushions.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  The sidewalks where they're going to place the couch.  Aw, this couch looks comfortable. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, I might just have to take a nap while you make that delivery.  Aw.  Huh.  Big urine stain on the middle cushion.  Well, if they don't put it there, someone will.  Ha!  Ha!  Uh, well, let's go to Steve in Massachusetts.  Steve?  Fucking phone's busy.  Hey, Steve.  I'm going to the phones to try to help you out, Jimmy.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve!  Massachusetts got fucked by a person delivery you go what's your name oh you 
[01:45:30]  asshole Jimmy take the call on the air hold on hold on we gotta listen to this  no I can't leave her a message oh he is he is so angry he is so pissed let's go to uh John on Long  Island John hey how you doing guys all right I got I got fucking locked up because of a furniture

[01:46:30]  take it home myself have my son help me the guy gets shitty behind the counter with me I drag him  over the counter and beat the snot out of him yeah I think that's what uh Jimmy is ready to do yeah  he's pacing outside the studio now now we can't even do a show until we uh get to the bottom of  his uh I can really hear you guys bill from Waterford is saying uh I hope the couch company  has karma chameleon on their hold line and Devin reminds me of the Brian Regan bit about uh the 
[01:47:00]  phone company can't you just flip a switch yeah we're gonna flip that switch next Tuesday  when you want your phone turned on yeah you want to turn it on it's just like flipping a switch he  nailed that too it's like well we could turn your phone on next week but but isn't it just flipping  a switch yeah we're gonna flip that switch next Tuesday that is really good flip it now wow Eric is  putting his life in danger oh he totally is he's got a wireless mic right now he's completely insane 
[01:47:30]  by the way the wireless mic I don't hear it at all Jimmy's gonna kill him is it on I hear it I hear  it yeah it's on he's waiting but Jimmy's on hold my poor guy there's no uh reason no reason  he should be uh in a tizzy he rescheduled afternoon why every I know it's gonna happen  they're gonna take you that guy was uh-oh yes all right here we go Jimmy's outside the studio 
[01:48:00]  we have a mic sort of yes  but I know I know but the problem is this this is my concern um every single stop they  make that couch is gonna have to come off and then go back on that call it got rattled the way  that they know they're gonna have to deliver it so now I know that something's gonna happen to it  it's gonna be  and wait another you know six years I've been waiting for this for two months I'm going to Los Angeles 
[01:48:30]  and this is gonna be a big problem they they loaded it wrong it's not I know what's gonna happen  I love that the caller got to him that that one caller really did I saw his eyes picturing the couch  going on and off the big monkeys just heaving it because it's not their couch no I mean we've all  helped our friends move oh awful shit you always lean the couch up on those two little legs 
[01:49:00]  much more weight than it's supposed to have when you're moving your own stuff you're very careful  even if you're moving your best friend's stuff yeah you're knocking it to walls tip it up sideways tip  it up right oh I think it could fit this way hundreds of pounds with the wrong leverage on the  feet step over it you gotta do you gotta do that like fancy couch math to to get through is it gonna  fit all right tip it up and then turn it sideways right oh it's just banging the wall if we flip it 
[01:49:30]  as we turn it on a 45 degree angle I think we can flip it over the stairs it's not gonna fit get  the hammer I gotta take the hinges off the door he really this kind of stuff kills him I know and  and you know you can't blame him it drives me nuts too you just expect something when you call  somewhere to get something done you just expect to have it done well I've told the story on the air 
[01:50:00]  I got a uh a sony like uh I don't know like a 50 inch picture tube the biggest they were making  at the time and it figures the next year the flat screens are all the rage and the price finally  drops always the way but I have a tv that has to weigh 500 pounds in my living room okay and it got  delivered Anthony yeah and uh it was delivered by a bunch of guys that look like they just got out of  prison yes and they oh my god the couch is going to be spread all right I'm just worried I've been 
[01:50:30]  waiting for a long time for this thing and I but if if if there's something wrong I know that that's  just a chance you take when you order something but it's gonna be a month's very nice no I oh that's  sounded like a threat oh absolutely maybe I just won't bring it okay yeah that's fine I'll because 
[01:51:00]  I can't be there after a five okay and they said they won't be taking it in and out okay thank you  they're gonna fuck this couch up now on purpose they're gonna spit on it because they're now pissed  oh Jimmy oh Jimmy she's nice I mean the woman is nice yeah she did what she was supposed to do they  fucked up and she said that they they she called them and told them uh-huh of the concern at least she did do  that and she said they said they'll leave it it's gonna be on the side of the truck I'm sure guys that are unloading 
[01:51:30]  furniture all day are gonna be very sympathetic now to the couch that's in the way to the three phone calls that  they've gotten don't let anything happen to this couch and it's not like they're looking at that couch realizing if they were able to  deliver it it wouldn't be in the way for all I know for all the other don't like their couch at home doesn't have a duct tape on  the armrest right as they're moving someone else's TV off the back of the truck they're not they're not just taking a quick kick to the couch that is in their way and where would you rather take a break sitting on the tail end of the truck while you eat your lunch or sitting on a nice couch they can sit on the couch 
[01:52:00]  I'm sure it's wrapped with your cranky ass nice comfy couch after you're moving furniture with that ass all day just lathering up you know what though this is one thing I'll tell you that the legs are are covered with with the cardboard or something  you think they got the cardboard and the tape around them I'm sure they do yeah I'm sure they don't just load it  I don't know why I'm thinking that they're just gonna load this thing with nothing on it other than you know like they're just gonna scrape it up and bang I have this vision that they're just gonna like put it on its side on the street 
[01:52:30]  of course there's nice plastic over it let's go to the gooch in Cleveland the gooch what's up fellas what's up I own a delivery company okay and every you get there in the morning you try to schedule deliveries everybody has some type of little fancy thing that they want done everybody's fancy like Jimmy Norton and everything gets fucked up I know what the time thing you're talking about yeah exactly no drop the fucking thing off and leave and stay on schedule you can't do that yes you can you get to the little Jewish lady I want this upstairs 
[01:53:00]  and he says you're supposed to take the old one you get all kinds of shit from people you're right dude you're right people are scumbags exactly I did this correctly I actually called them yesterday and had they not been able to reschedule if they said we can't because it's impossible we had one of the interns that was going to help me out and wait there and just make sure that they put it where I wanted to scrape the floor so I was ready to do that and then she's like no no no we fixed it and then they screwed up on the this happened with a time warning cable recently it's like you talk to somebody it doesn't get fixed fast enough cable companies are different I'm just saying you get it 
[01:53:30]  get there and there's always some kind of fucking problem well they wouldn't have been with me I would have been standing there with bells on hello gentlemen I would have given them a little tip so if you scrape the floor I'll cry please don't and they wouldn't have all right well good luck thanks there goes the gooch in Cleveland John in Jersey go ahead John yeah Jimmy can't you just call them back and tell them I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio she knows I'm on the radio I love that from the intro of the show she does know I'm on the radio I'm Jim Norton on the radio all right we got to move on thank you 
[01:54:00]  well we'll see what happens with your couch okay Jimmy yes it's just you know how it is in life you deal with stuff you just want stuff done the way you want it done I got a little update on my problem today if you don't know what's going on you better listen to the replay I wasn't invited into the secret room they're doing this thing called Christmas in August debuting all the new XM gadgets that will be available in the fall and in time for Christmas and they have all these gadgets in the big room and they're all impressive 
[01:54:30]  it's not secret at this moment and I was not allowed to go in there even though I'm an XM employee and I ranted and raved for a while you can hear it in the replay well I got an email from Mr. Wickland Don who runs 202 Ope spoke with Elo a few times this morning we are both rather upset yes with the situation and are finding out what happened and why you were denied access to the secret room that all capitals was the reason I wanted you to go to the 
[01:55:00]  event in the first place oh wonderful to see the incredible gadgets for Christmas I even called the marketing people why would they get back to you and told them to expect you at the event are you kidding me so Don called the people from marketing and said that I was on my way to the event and I think one of them probably goes no he's not getting in no reason why marketing should have not let you seen everything there no reason at all I have a meeting up in New York tomorrow and we can talk about it 
[01:55:30]  with Elo and come up with the marketing plan and schedules for the next six months as well you know let me tell you something this is personal this is nothing to do with business this wasn't them saying well you know certain people are allowed in and it's the fact that they don't like this show on a personal level and kept you from going into the secret room because they don't like you personally 
[01:56:00]  because if Don had called in advance and said look Opie's coming here's here's the deal then there isn't a problem there it isn't even that someone like they said told them that you weren't allowed in someone told them you were allowed in and they still didn't let you in  well Stephanie told me I wasn't allowed in nobody marketing I want to see a rolling head nobody likes to be called out on the radio nobody likes it yep because people aren't honest man people want to just you know languish in anonymity and not do what they're supposed to do and collect a check and not be spoken about I'm sorry right 
[01:56:30]  and also Ann Taylor who I've never really had a problem with by the way she's always been pretty cool to us she also said I wasn't allowed in  maybe it came from over her so we all know who it came from no one wants to say it we all know where it came from all right well we'll get to the bottom of that I'll talk to Elo after the show my couch here we go Anthony one of the big stories of the day should we do it after the break I gotta take a leak me too Opie you gotta all leak yeah we'll talk about the you threw away your apple cake I was so scrumptious I can't tell you to walk into a studio that unaware 
[01:57:00]  like yeah you gotta put something down quiet but to just come in crumpling hey who's coffee  that was really holy shit like what the fuck are you thinking like I Tim is sitting here he did it to his 
[01:57:30]  cake then he does it to my cake it's like oblivious he really did come in here just a crinkling buffoon I'm not spouting  Shakespeare but it's like there are people listening to this this is not a fucking hobby  you're telling a story but we're so good at what we do people just assume that we're just hanging out  talking yeah see that we have that type of environment that uh people feel like they could  just walk in and give us our stuff he really did mess that up it was oblivious yeah most unprofessional 
[01:58:00]  professional radio show in the business but it should be known to the staff around us that you don't just  come in while someone's talking on the air regardless of what they're talking about whether you're doing a  serious news story or goof and just crinkle paper bags into the microphone it's the fucking guy in  the back of the comedy club talking that's what it is then you look over and you realize it's a  member of the the one of the waitresses you're like you fucking work here what are you doing  unbelievable you expect that certain times in life you know when the when the audience members 
[01:58:30]  talking that's what it is but it's one of the waitresses you're like oh Jesus yeah all right we're  gonna go to break with this when we get back we're gonna talk about the snakehead fish that's terrorizing  uh i guess everybody according to the news i don't know i got in trouble at um what comedy club was  it the one you're doing comedy time yeah the seller but it wasn't even me i'm hanging out at uh my  girlfriend with me and then other people were at the same table and they're yapping like crazy and i  think who was it david tell was on stage i think it was and he just starts like

[01:59:30]  like he might have looked over one time and seeing you say one thing like not you i just went okay  and that's that's what you see and that's how you react i'm not saying that happens sometimes on  stage you don't realize who it is i never talk during the comics i am mr quiet kick-a-lock  that's why you attack the table in general because you're not sure who it is but he was just  attacking me i wasn't yeah he was you know making me the guy the asshole so people can chuckle at  the asshole at the table fuck a stick a story about the snake had fish on the way i don't want

[02:03:30]  Opie and Anthony, XM202. 
[02:04:00]  Here it is, Anthony, my favorite song on Ethel.  Yeah.  Danny Warhol's Smoke It.  You like this one?  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  This just in, breaking news.  Dick Cavett will not be appearing on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Yeah.  Ben comes in.  Dick Cavett's got to reschedule.  And I said, Dick Cavett is absolutely never appearing on this program.  Did Andy Dick reschedule?  Didn't he have to reschedule? 
[02:04:30]  Didn't he have to reschedule?  And then I said, Ben goes, no, no, he's going to be here.  I go, Ben, I will bet you right now $100.  And I pulled it out, put it on the console and said, match it right now.  That's how confident I am that we will never, ever be speaking with the likes of Dick Cavett.  Do you think the listeners are starting to get it?  That we get absolutely no respect whatsoever in this business?  We don't get, instead of getting Dick Cavett, we have, now, I don't want Jim Gaffigan to be here. 
[02:05:00]  I'm going to take that as a compliment.  Jim Gaffigan is a fantastic guest on this program.  You guys act so upset about Dick Cavett not doing the show.  It's like, see how we don't get, what is he, like 84?  It's like, what's, well, man, he talked to John Lennon, though.  And interviewed many people.  Remember the Richard Nixon interviews?  Have you talked to John Lennon?  Not lately.  Joko, George Harrison?  No.  Who else did Dick Cavett interview?  Let me, uh, Dick Cavett's got this DVD out.  Here are some of the people that Dick Cavett has talked to over the years. 
[02:05:30]  David Bowie, David Crosby, George Harrison, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, Ravi Shanker.  Do we have anything from the last 20 years?  Who's his booker?  These guys are legends, though, man.  It would be great to get a story about Paul Simon, or Sly and the Family Stone, or Stephen  Still, Stevie Wonder, Gary Wright.  The list goes on and on.  Oh, this just coming in, Dick Cavett had to cancel because he's waiting for his couch at  his apartment.  Very upset.  We just stink. 
[02:06:00]  We suck ass.  Instead, we get, uh...  Don't say it like that.  Jesus Christ.  Jim Gaffigan is a fine guest on this program.  He is very good, very funny, very loyal to the show, and when he says he's going to show  up by gum, he's here.  That's right.  Not like Dick Cavett or Andy.  I never thought I'd be compared to Dick Cavett.  I think it's Dick, something like Dick.  They don't appear on this show.  You're compared to Dick Cavett?  No, well, you know, he was saying that I'm hurt.  No, we like you. 
[02:06:30]  It's just, we were hoping for Dick Cavett today.  I'm no Dick Cavett.  Do you see Dick Cavett in Sierra Mist commercials?  No, you don't.  Oh, oh, oh.  No, he probably wouldn't do him.  The greatest soft drink on the planet.  It is the best.  It's a great soda.  It's great.  Was Dick Cavett in the meow segment of Super Troopers?  No, he wasn't.  That's right.  Absolutely not.  Legendary funny cult film.  Did Dick Cavett narrate Sidesplitters?  I feel not.  No, he did not.  I absolutely didn't know that. 
[02:07:00]  You didn't know that?  I was the pale white guy that was doing it.  He was great.  Yeah, that's great.  See, Dick Cavett wasn't there doing that.  He certainly wasn't.  And he auditioned for it.  Jim Gavigan in studio.  Yes.  I'd rather hang out with Jim Gavigan.  Of course.  Anyway, instead of Dick Cavett.  I wouldn't, and I like Gavigan a lot.  But I want a picture with Dick Cavett.  You want a picture with Dick Cavett.  I have a photo with Jim.  I know Jim for ten years. 
[02:07:30]  They're both blonde.  We're both getting couches.  Right.  Hey, did we get any more audio from that radio show yet?  Which one?  Is Travis working on it?  He's doing that in the TV, yeah.  It's kind of hard to get his cord out there to the middle of the road.  What?  I was just commenting on what Fan had called him.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Can we play the audio of the snakehead fish?  Yeah, I want to hear what this is about.  Jim, if you would bear with us. 
[02:08:00]  This is a news story.  We like doing news teasers usually.  Yeah.  You're familiar with those.  You sit at home and get petrified by the news.  Yeah.  We play those a lot, but we missed the teaser on this one apparently, but the story is just  as good.  There are snakeheaded fish.  Very dangerous.  Get in!  They're in our area.  How will this affect you?  Tune in.  We'll tell you later in the broadcast.  They made it sound like we all should be scared of the snakehead fish. 
[02:08:30]  Snakeheaded fish.  I love it.  And then you wait an hour.  And you hear a story of that.  And then they say two lines about it.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Here's a fish head that looks like a snake.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute, Chris.  Sports.  Oh, he lost him.  Someone's saying that Dick Cavett is on Imus right now.  Put on...  No, he's off TV.  Oh, he's off the TV right now?  He's off TV.  Put the radio on in the office.  Oh.  Is Dick Cavett on Imus instead of our show?  Oh, he blows up for Imus. 
[02:09:00]  Well, for his audience.  I mean, but why couldn't they just schedule both?  Yeah, of course.  Imus's audience, but maybe he still would have had...  What time was he supposed to be here?  9.30.  9.30?  If he's on Imus right now, that'd be a little rough.  Imus is in Jersey, right?  Yeah.  I thought they were in Jersey?  Or is he in Queens now?  Queens.  Oh, no, Queens.  Okay, he used to be in New Mexico.  Isn't he?  Yeah.  Is he at the ranch in New Mexico?  Whenever I watch him.  New Mexico.  I'm up at like 5 in the morning.  He'll be via satellite on a ranch.  Dressed like a cowboy with my hat and brother's salsa. 
[02:09:30]  Opie's brother's pitching his t-shirts.  Imus's brother's got the salsa.  The Imus salsa.  Your brother's got some things going on, too.  Of course he does.  They're all leeches and saps.  The whole slew of them.  Get off my back.  You are lucky, my friend.  Let me tell you.  Maybe we should tell Jim Gaffigan that this show is pretty much falling apart in front of your eyes today. 
[02:10:00]  Why do you say you seem a little cranky?  What's...  You need a hot fella.  His neck hurts.  I need a little hot fella.  He wasn't invited to the secret room and his neck hurts.  That's right.  Maybe he's got the couch problem.  He's got the couch problem.  And Anthony, nothing ever bothers him.  I'm just a psychopath.  You've got to see a chiropractor.  I said I was sorry about the head thing.  Jesus Christ.  Sometimes I get a little overzealous.  You know, you grab both ears.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Here's the story on the snake head fish.  I've got to hear this. 
[02:10:30]  It's a frankenfish straight out of a horror movie.  Frankenfish.  It's a frankenfish.  Frankenfish.  The comedy writers over there at Fox News.  Here, I'll write the copy on this story.  Uh, frankenfish.  Dracula trout.  No, that doesn't work.  Fish with Down syndrome.  No, we can't say that.  Wolf bass.  No.  Frankenfish.  That'll get the listeners.  Yeah.  This'll get everybody's attention.  They think a fish with bolts out of its neck are just swimming around our area. 
[02:11:00]  Do fish have necks?  Um, let me think.  It's head body.  What's...  They don't have necks.  Head body.  That's why when they look left, their ribs turn.  We don't want to sensationalize this, so we'll just call it frankenfish.  Wait, what's the area between the back of his eyes and the gills?  His tail.  I would call that a neck.  He's got...  It's just...  It's fucking head, torso, tail.  There's no neck.  Frankenfish.  It's one long glop of shit with eyes.  Ew.  I'd call that a conglomerated... 
[02:11:30]  Malata.  Munger.  Class of swimming creature.  Bring it.  Here we go.  Frankenfish.  It's a frankenfish straight out of a horror movie.  It can breathe air, walk on land, and devour anything in its path.  The snakehead fish is an Asian invader that can eat up all the other fish in the lake.  The primitive fish hasn't been seen in this country since they invaded a pond in Maryland three years ago.  Well, now the ugly creatures with sharp teeth have been discovered in a lake in Flushing Meadows in Queens. 
[02:12:00]  They actually, you know, don't attack humans, so that's not a concern anyone should have.  And quite frankly, it's one of the reasons we're having a very tough time catching them,  is they seem to be afraid of humans.  State conservationists may add salt to the water to kill off the snakeheads.  If that doesn't work, then they'll have to poison the lake.  Ha, ha, ha.  We had to destroy the village in order to save it.  Why would you want to kill them?  We care about the environment.  Yeah.  We might have to poison the fish.  That's my favorite part of the story, yeah, because we'll do that to the environment, no problem. 
[02:12:30]  But there's neighborhoods that need to be poisoned.  Well, we don't go poisoning the entire neighborhood.  It's a dangerous neighborhood.  There's some bad elements in there that are harming the other people.  Right.  Poison the neighborhood.  Well, we have no problem taking out entire lakes because of a stupid snakehead fish.  But that story leaves so many loose ends.  I don't even know where to start.  First of all, how did the walking fish get into a lake?  I can understand it getting into Maryland somehow.  If they swam from Asia, they walked into the lake. 
[02:13:00]  How did they get into a lake?  In Flushing.  A prankster.  You think a prankster?  No, no, no.  I remember one time.  This isn't true.  I'm on the road.  I saw a weird sign.  I was like, what does that mean?  Lake or bust?  Even though it kind of landed, I should still get a car crash in that.  How would he hitch with a fin?  He's just nodding his head stuck.  I think I remember that story from a couple years ago.  There was some guy that brought that fish head or snake head over from China. 
[02:13:30]  Just to dump it in a lake and flush it.  And he put it in a lake.  That is a hardy fish.  Wouldn't you need two of them?  A male and a female?  Or perhaps just a pregnant female, I guess.  If it's a frankenfish, who knows?  Who knows what it's screwing over there.  It'll eat anything in its way.  By the way, it doesn't eat humans.  And it's afraid of people.  And there's nothing to worry about it.  And it's a vegetarian.  Frankenfish is a faggot.  They talk about frankenfish walking on land, sharp teeth, eats anything in its sight. 
[02:14:00]  But it's completely harmless.  And we might have to poison it.  It sucks the cocks of other male fish and eats berries alone.  And thank you for enjoying this filler program.  Really.  Now, yeah.  And now back to headliners and legends.  It gets there.  Thank you, Jim.  You've told us how it got into the lake.  Yes.  But now, why would they then poison the lake if this fish is screwing around and killing the other fish?  Then let it. 
[02:14:30]  Because it'll just take over the entire lake.  Didn't you see the movie Independence Day?  They have to attack.  I don't know.  You've got to kill them.  Oh, perhaps they'll get up, walk out of that lake, hit another lake.  We'll lose one city, but we'll save the world.  Right.  Okay.  So they have to nuke that lake.  And eventually we'll have lakes just filled with snakehead fishes and nothing else to look at.  I gotcha.  I just wish we could do this in neighborhoods.  We have to trick this frankenfish. 
[02:15:00]  We'll give him a cold.  That's what we'll do.  We'll give the frankenfish a cold.  It'll know when it comes in for a prescription.  Oh, hey, frankenfish.  How are you?  Welcome.  Here's some cyanide.  That helps get rid of the sniffles.  This frankenfish is trying to present it as something dangerous to people.  Obviously it's not.  Sure.  Thank you for getting to the bottom of the frankenfish.  That'll come back in three months.  You know, we should play this with Jim Gaffigan because he's here. 
[02:15:30]  What's that?  We talk about news teasers all the time and how they scare the shit out of you, right?  Just to make you watch the news.  Yeah.  And here's our favorite one so far.  Listen to this real fast.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  What?  Come on.  Just three blocks of pedophiles just walking around with keys to your house. 
[02:16:00]  What?  Big pockets stuffed with candy, just carrying little cute puppies with them.  What?  I love it.  Three-block area.  You don't have to watch the news if you don't care about your kids.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Little patent leather shoes and a shrub with burgundy stains on it.  White ruffled socks.  Holy crap.  How good is that?  That's just amazing. 
[02:16:30]  Is that priceless?  It's like, even the teasers, it's like, then when you finally watch it, it's like 10 seconds.  They're like, oh, by the way, got you, asshole.  Right.  And that story is perfect because it sounds very dangerous, but there is no way.  What politician is going into a town and going, we want sex offenders right here in a three-block area.  It'll be a tourist attraction.  Every one of them we want put right here.  It's not going to happen.  And the story winds up being that this town, which is a certain square footage, a certain area of the whole town, they would be distributed around. 
[02:17:00]  But if you put it all together, it would equal a three-block area.  Right.  Not one three-block area.  Again, we don't want to sensationalize this.  Yeah.  We want to be objective.  We just want to put the news out there and have people decide.  That's why I'm a caster.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house. 
[02:17:30]  Right next to my house.  I love the typing in the background.  This is just a newsflash.  It's real.  Real news.  They broke that story.  Not even in your neighborhood.  Right next to your house.  The guy's there with his cock through a knothole in your fence.  Just trying to water your lawn.  There he is, right next to your house.  He's got a smiley face painted on the helmet, and the kid is kissing it.  Hi, mister!  Let's back up a little bit. 
[02:18:00]  Joe in Orlando, go ahead.  Hey, yeah, the snakehead fish, you can actually buy them live in Asian supermarkets, and they're a delicacy.  And what people do is they bring them home, they try to raise them, they realize what a hassle they are.  So instead of killing them, they throw them in like a local pond.  What a hassle.  What, do they take the car without asking?  They poop all over the house.  Yeah, it's a fish.  And the other thing, Norton, you realize that when you call that sofa place, you told the people that are pissed off at the sofa place that you're going to be leaving to go to L.A. for a while?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  I'm not going to be at my apartment.  No, no, no, in case they want to reschedule or something.  Oh, they can't get into this.  Oh, they're going to, hey, trust me, they're going to reschedule and go back to your apartment when you're not there.  Yeah, no, sorry, I have security there, actually, besides the door there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'm very safe.  And we really should get to the top story of the day.  This priest.  Ow.  Oh, the guy that, uh, a couple hours in the hotel?  Isn't this great?  Yeah.  Anthony, what do you know about this?  You were reading up on this one. 
[02:19:00]  Absolutely nothing.  Nothing?  No.  The guy's like 78.  Yeah, he's this old priest.  He's one of the head muckety-mucks down there at the old stomping ground up St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Yeah, we had a little problem with St. Patrick's Cathedral back in the day.  Yeah.  And it turns out the top St. Pat's aide at center of ugly divorce fight as husband says clerk had affair with wife.  Yeah, this woman.  Beauty and the priest.  Beauty and the priest.  That's cute.  Another headline that you read and just think, responsible journalism. 
[02:19:30]  That's what you're getting.  Again, we don't want to sensationalize.  No.  We just want to deliver.  Giving you the facts.  She is quite beautiful and he is a priest.  So let's put beauty in the priest.  Stop it.  And then you find out later on they were just like, you know, in a hotel room, kind of like planning a party.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, but you know something?  I was reading their excuse.  Really?  Well, what happens is this old priest, and he's got his aide, this woman, very attractive woman that works with him. 
[02:20:00]  They went out to the Hamptons, I guess, to do a little work.  I guess that's what the priests do, go out to the Hamptons.  Sure.  And they were driving back from the Hamptons.  Very long drive.  He's an old guy.  Right.  He was getting a little tired.  So they decided to stop off at a hotel that charges an hourly rate.  Why not?  But how far was this hotel from where they were at originally?  Not very far.  It's out on Long Island.  Not that far.  So they check into this hotel, and he says that she slept while he did some paperwork for two hours or so. 
[02:20:30]  That's it.  After two hours, they got back in the car and continued their drive.  And how did the cameras follow him?  I didn't read the article.  Because the husband, this woman's husband, hired a private investigator.  Excellent.  Yeah, and got pictures of them leaving this hotel and other things.  And there's a 14-year-old daughter, or a son of this woman, testify that he had walked in on her and the priest. 
[02:21:00]  She was sitting on the priest's lap in a teddy, and they were kissing.  And what they're saying is that the child had been coerced by the father.  What I don't understand is, like, why wouldn't they, you know, like, if they were out in the Hamptons, why would they have to stop at a hotel? 
[02:21:30]  Like, you know, I just think that, like, if they're going to do the nasty, they're going to do it in...  Out in the Hamptons.  Yeah.  Hasn't this guy ever heard of getting blown in the car?  Why do you have to pull over?  Little road head with your collar on.  How awful a husband are you when your wife decides to fuck a 78-year-old priest?  How awful are you in the sack?  You wouldn't want those pictures in the post.  What's worse, that or your wife is a teacher fucking the 12-year-old boy student? 
[02:22:00]  The 12-year-old boy student, because at least the priest can be some sort of a challenge.  Maybe he's paying her.  The boy student is just, that young cock just got her.  She's risking her personal liberty to get that young cock.  Exactly.  She'll go to jail.  She'll lose it all.  Right.  This is just awful.  She's kind of sexy.  Yeah, she's an attractive woman.  She's definitely a looker.  And the husband, yeah, they're in some divorce, so he's trying to come up with something, I guess.  That priest looks pretty old. 
[02:22:30]  He's 33 years older than the child.  But I'll tell you what could have happened.  You're saying, why would they not just do it in the Hamptons and drive it back?  Why do they stop?  You're in an affair like this.  You get yapping on the highway.  You start talking.  Maybe a little dirty talk's going back and forth.  You had a little sex the night before.  You're starting to talk about it.  And then it's like, you gotta fuck.  It doesn't matter where you are.  Yeah, but why would they go to an hourly hotel?  Where else are they gonna go?  They're in the car.  They don't need to cuddle after they're done.  They just go to the hourly. 
[02:23:00]  Because they probably didn't want to get a hotel for the whole night, because they're not staying the whole night.  They gotta be back.  Yeah, they want to just get the dirty deed out of the way and get back to the city.  And this guy has said some stuff in the past where he has condemned the United States of America,  saying it's probably one of the most immoral countries on the face of the earth.  And his whole thing has been about chastity, pushing chastity to kids and everything.  I got a quote from him.  A whole generation of Americans has been solicited by American popular culture, which is Hollywood and the media. 
[02:23:30]  Hollywood taking the most advanced step in this.  Yeah, he's blaming Hollywood and the media for corruption.  Hollywood is not a Christian place at all.  At all!  At all!  That's how it's written.  Most of the writers, the creative people, are homosexually inclined or homosexually recruited.  Well, now he makes a point.  It's the goddamn faggot, is what it is.  We lost most of the faggots. 
[02:24:00]  That's why entertainment stinks these days.  This guy...  Anyone?  With me on that point?  Thank you.  This guy is one of these hypocrites.  I'll make a blanket statement here.  Any of these people, whether they're the Holy Rollers or people that belong to certain organizations or stuff,  when you really push an issue, like this guy is pushing how immoral this country is  and how Hollywood is responsible for sex and stuff,  it is because you have such a problem with it...  Bill O'Reilly!  ...that you can't... 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, people like Bill O'Reilly, the same thing.  You have such a problem containing yourself that you have to just blurt this shit out to try to convince yourself.  It's people that are...  You know, you get the Boy Scout leaders that are...  They're the ones touching the kids.  The priests that are pushing that.  They're with little boys.  Sure.  People that say there's too much sex in the media.  They're the ones fucking swinging and banging 20 people a night.  Yeah, that's what it is.  These people are hypocrites.  They shouldn't be listening to them. 
[02:25:00]  At least this one's allegedly banging a female.  Right, right, right, as opposed to a kid.  Let us do what we want to do.  Let us do our own fucking thing and leave us alone.  Let us play our violent video games.  Let us talk about sex.  Let us have fun.  Just because you can't handle it.  And this priest, obviously, you know, he's there preaching, but he's getting laid on the side.  He's 78.  I mean, maybe I don't know old people.  It's 78?  It's like, I'm 30 and 39.  I'm exhausted.  Slowing down. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, this guy's 78 years old, and he's banging it out with no-tell motel on the LIE.  Maybe when he was 70, he got his first piece of ass.  He's just discovering it.  It took so long.  Yeah.  Wow.  Imagine that.  I've got to make up for some lost time.  I've missed this.  Let's see.  Let's go to Connor in Rockland.  Connor?  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I just want to say it's the worst excuse ever because they said the priest was tired, so he stopped over, but he ended up doing paperwork anyway.  Yeah, they were both really tired. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that's true.  You'd think the priest would have been napping if he was 70.  Yeah, a load of crap.  Yeah, I think she was driving, so she got tired, and he didn't want to drive.  She was worn out from the night before.  They suggested they go to the motel.  Is this hotel or motel known as a sleazy place, Anthony?  I'm not sure.  I've never been there.  Hourly rate kind of is a little bit.  Yeah, that's a little much.  Hourly rate.  I just want to sleep for a couple hours.  Let's pull over.  Hey, let's pull over.  Why not? 
[02:26:30]  Could I get the jungle room, please?  I'll have the condom dispenser in the room as a red flag, too.  Yeah.  With the jizz koozie.  Yeah.  Oh, who would use one of those?  I have.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Have you ever used one of them and get a mouthful of jizz koozie water?  Yeah.  Jizz koozie.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Did you really use one?  Yeah, I'm just joking.  Oh.  I don't do motels.  I do car and out.  Yeah, that's true.  It's a new place called the Saturn Inn. 
[02:27:00]  20-minute rate.  Suck it and beat it.  That's our motto.  Unlock the door.  Checkout time.  That's right.  Don't forget to get your miles.  And I'm cleaning a load off myself.  Housekeeping.  That's sad.  Yeah.  Well, we'll see what happens with the priest and the beauty.  Yeah, you know this story's got legs, right?  A little bit.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Connecticut.  Ryan? 
[02:27:30]  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Just wanted to say I caught a gasp in his waistband on Friday night.  Pretty much kicked ass.  Oh, thanks.  Didn't realize anybody could do about an hour on food.  Yeah.  Which was on the hot pockets alone.  Yeah.  But we'll enjoy the show.  Have a great time.  Thanks a lot, man.  That's about it.  Punch it out.  Love you, Jimmy.  Love you, Ant.  Thanks, man.  This guy remembers one of my quotes of old.  One of my little words of wisdom.  Yeah.  I always said if you're absolutely positive that your significant other is not cheating 
[02:28:00]  on you, they might be.  If you think even the slightest bit that they might be cheating, they absolutely are.  And that's the way it is.  And that's living your life without fear.  That's right.  If by cheating...  You're getting cheated.  If there's an inkling, if you wake up tired, you're getting cheated on. 
[02:28:30]  That's sad.  Yeah.  That's weird.  A priest living out in the Hamptons.  I didn't know they made that kind of money.  No, I don't think it was living...  I don't know what they were doing.  I'm going to have to look over that story and see what the hell a priest and his little  hot secretary were doing out in the Hamptons.  What the hell is that?  It's not a place for priests.  Who-hoo robbing in general, right?  Absolutely not.  All right.  We got Jim Gaffigan in studio.  We'll take a break.  Are you promoting anything, Jim?  I am doing an hour special on October 8th in Chicago at the Vic Theater. 
[02:29:00]  Tickets are on sale now.  I hope you all come.  Do you have a number, sweetie?  I don't have a number.  Ticketmaster.com, sweetie.  Well, that's a good website.  There you go.  What's it for?  It's for Comedy Central.  And it's...  Oh.  What's his name?  October 8th.  October 8th.  Very good.  More with Jim Gaffigan.  Hey, we got more audio from the Marco and Aaron show.  Thank God.  We'll explain this to Jim Gaffigan next.  Boobs always bring this show to a halt.

It's Whip-em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Whip-em-Out Wednesday.  Huh?  Show us your findings.  Oh, wow.  And we're back with the O.B.  And we're back with the O.B.  And we're back with the O.B.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program in studio, Jim Gaffigan, a very funny man. 
[02:31:00]  We love when he comes in and hangs with us.  Thank you.  Cute story, isn't it, Jim?  It is.  What's a cute story?  What did I miss?  Uh, I miss something good?  This should be a bumper sticker.  Daily News.  It's in the Body and Soul section.  Yeah.  Body and Soul. 
[02:31:30]  I guess this is the, um...  Want me to play...  Forget it.  Do you have any of the lifetime music?  I was going to say, you want me to play some Kitaro?  Yeah, man.  This is the, um...  You know, they got the Ask the Doctor section.  Sanjay Gupta.  Yeah, Sanjay Gupta.  He's taking over CNN, isn't he?  He was huge during the, uh...  When he was embedded with the troops and actually had to do brain surgery on a young Iraqi child.  I became part of the story.  Shut up. 
[02:32:00]  Shut up.  Sanjay Gupta.  There's actually on this page, three...  A couple of different women.  Three different, like, little headings of stories about their...  Uh, what is it?  Abusive relationships.  Yeah.  Darker side of dating.  The dark side of dating.  And, uh...  Yeah, one caught my eye.  I was thumbing through the newspaper and it just caught my eye.  Well, the first one was, uh...  I felt I would hurt him if I told anyone.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  And the other one was, uh...  He became controlling and would say cruel things.  Oh, that's sad. 
[02:32:30]  And that must be the one that caught your eye.  Uh, no.  No.  There's a couple more.  Which one?  Um...  Well, it wasn't even...  He made it clear I'd be dead if I left him.  Wasn't even that one.  The one that really caught my eye?  Oh, is it, uh...  Is that...  I'm trying to find it on the, uh...  Yeah.  The, um...  Hold on.  No, I'm just trying to find it because I...  I'm sorry, man.  I'm in the...  I don't have the, uh...  Yeah, where is it?  No, it's not that one. 
[02:33:00]  There you go.  Ah, here it is, right.  I miscarried when he kicked my stomach.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh.  Carolyn, or is it Caroline?  Chico.  17 years old.  17.  I was 13.  He was 24.  He worked at a pet store nearby cleaning the cages. 
[02:33:30]  What a catch.  Oh, this guy's a classic.  He was pet...  Cleaning the cages in a pet store.  Cleaning bird shit all day.  Ooh, a 13-year-old.  He's 24.  She's 13.  Oh, my God.  The first time we went out, you could say he seduced me.  I went a lot further than we'd planned.  Oh.  That's great.  A week later...  She's 13.  A week later, he gave me a pager to keep track of me.  He got really jealous when a friend called and pulled me off the couch and threw me on the floor. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Nice.  He apologized afterwards, saying he was only angry because he loved me so much.  That's a great relationship.  Three months later, he choked me.  This time for about five minutes.  Jesus.  But each time it was for longer and longer.  I became pregnant three times by him.  Oh.  The first time I miscarried when he kicked my stomach.  Eric, there you go. 
[02:34:30]  Paging Dr. Martin.  Dr. Martin.  Paging Dr. Martin.  You have an abortion to perform.  Dr. Martin.  Oh.  That's great.  She terminated the second pregnancy, but the third time was a charm.  She gave birth to a daughter, who is now a year old. 
[02:35:00]  And has an unexplained loafer print in her face.  Jesus.  Old steel tip head.  I was 13.  Did I ever tell you my method if a gal gets pregnant?  Yeah, Jim.  Did I ever tell you my method where you put your foot out in front of the steps, and you  call it the old whoopsie daisy? 
[02:35:30]  No wonder nobody wants to do this program.  I know.  Could you see Dick Cavett chuckling at this stuff?  Yeah.  Wonder if it would have been a boy or a girl.  Good point, Dick.  How about the ribs, Dick?  That reminds me of my interview.  When I was interviewing Richard Milhouse Nixon, do you know he once kicked his wife in the  stomach?  Of course he should have canceled.  Who are we kidding?  She finally decided to leave because she was worried about her daughter. 
[02:36:00]  I told a teacher, but she referred me to the guidance counselor.  She's still in school, you know.  She's 17 years old.  And she had to go to the guidance counselor.  Later, I found Break the Cycle, and they helped me get an order of protection.  There's an organization called Break the Cycle out there.  Guys have one, too.  It's when they pick up motorcycles and throw it over their wife's head.  No, nothing.  Break the Cycle over her head.  Oh, dear Lord.  I'm going to college next year and feel like I'm ready to take care of my future. 
[02:36:30]  Well, she moved on.  That's nice.  Wow.  On the phone, Wheelchair Fred.  Hey, fellas, it's been a long time.  What's up?  What's up, Wheelchair Fred?  How are you today?  I'm pretty good.  Yeah?  Did you hear it's my anniversary next week?  What?  What?  It's my anniversary next week.  It's your anniversary next week?  What is it?  Your anniversary of what?  Twenty-one years in the wheelchair. 
[02:37:00]  How many years?  Twenty-one.  Oh, we missed your 20th anniversary?  Yeah, you blood.  That sucks.  Do you think I'm going to start with longer and longer?  Do you actually think I'm going to start that wet chicken at Wackbag?  What?  Longer and longer.  Like finger and finger.  I'm saying longer the way I've said it my whole life. 
[02:37:30]  Longer.  You can go fuck yourself.  Yeah, you don't say longer.  You don't say longer.  Unless you're an older Jewish man.  If you're saying longer, wet chicken at Wackbag.  I'm banning him.  No, don't ban him.  I'm banning wet chicken.  No, you can't ban him.  All right.  Jesus.  That's a comment, Anthony.  I'm going back to saying but, by the way.  Are you?  You should.  I'm starting to say it.  You're saying but?  No, only crazy people.  You'll be but in your place.  Jim Gaffigan, on the phone is wheelchair Fred.  Do you know who wheelchair Fred is?  I do not know. 
[02:38:00]  Oh.  He goes way back with us.  He was in a horrific motorcycle accident.  We're finding out 21 years ago.  Can I bring the brick, the cycle joke back?  No?  Wheelchair Fred?  No.  Yeah, August 17th, 1984.  August 17th, 1984.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the day, huh?  That's when he lost the use of his legs.  That was the day wheelchair Fred.  You became wheelchair Fred, yeah.  And that happened.  He also collapsed his windpipe.  Oh.  And that screwed up his voice. 
[02:38:30]  He's completely there.  His mind is fine.  Even though he sounds like a...  Usually he's okay.  Mongoloid.  But he's, if I may use the proper terminology, a mongoloid retard.  All right, listen.  So here's the deal.  Wheelchair Fred is prominently displayed in our Penthouse interview, Mr. Gaffigan.  That is on newsstands now.  We're in the latest issue of Penthouse Magazine.  I want to read the first two paragraphs to Jim Gaffigan, Anthony. 
[02:39:00]  All right?  Yes.  It's near the end of a typical Thursday show for Opie, real name Greg Hughes.  Oh, they got something on me.  Oh, they got that.  Oh, they figured out my real name.  And Anthony, last name Kumia, at their new XM Studios located near Central Park in New York City.  The guys and their sidekick Jim Norton are on the air, listening to call-in guest wheelchair Fred, who is now on the phone,  report the day's news from his bathtub as he inserts a dildo into his ass.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the FCC can do nothing but sit back and listen with them.  Yeah, yeah.  Sitting around a large circular table, microphones pointed at their mouths.  Pointed at our mouths.  Jesus.  The guys encouraged Fred to keep using the dildo.  Opie, the taller blonde one, laughed so hard his face has turned red.  While Anthony, the shorter dark-haired one.  Shorter dark-haired one.  The swarly Italian.  What is that shorter, dark-haired one? 
[02:40:00]  The adjectives are amazing.  Yeah.  You're shorter and you have dark hair.  Tall, blonde.  I'm not much shorter.  According to the first picture in the penthouse interview, you look like a midget next to me.  Yeah, I know.  They took it on the stairs.  They took it on the stairs.  I'm standing on the lower step.  Opie's standing on the one above it.  So I look like I am the shorter, dark-haired one.  There's no stairs in sight.  That's what makes this great picture.  Well, we have a great time here on the radio.  I love being the shorter, dark-haired one. 
[02:40:30]  Where is the picture?  Because Tim's got to see it.  I'm at least a head.  I'm at least like 18 inches tall, though.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  If you could see like a banister, it would all make sense.  But it just looks like you're just a really short guy.  Mm-hmm.  Sitting around.  Okay, we did that part.  I laughed so hard, my face turned red, while Anthony, the shorter, darker-haired one,  is enthusiastically recommending Strawberry KY Jelly.  Enthusiastically recommending?  Yeah.  Then for about a minute, Opie and Anthony fall silent and let Fred take over the show. 
[02:41:00]  Meanwhile, producers are running back and forth into the studio, reminding the guys that  they have Scream 2 star Jerry O'Connell on the phone waiting to get on the air.  Never did get to him, did we?  But the dildo bit runs too long, and poor O'Connell is bumped from the show.  It would have been a tough act to follow anyway.  That's how the interview starts in the latest issue of Penthouse Magazine.  Wonderful.  And we got Fred on the phone.  And he's looking for $600. 
[02:41:30]  What?  What for?  Fred, what do you need $600 for?  Just expensive.  I need money.  Just for everything.  Anything and everything.  Expensive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll help you out, Fred.  What are you, manics?  Oh, sure.  And I told him about it, I was thinking, maybe we get the fans to help to give a dollar  each to keep me up. 
[02:42:00]  Give a dollar each?  You want to pass a fucking hat?  Where?  You want the fans to just start sending you their hard-earned money.  Yeah, what the heck?  Because you're too lazy to work.  Oh, Jesus.  Exactly.  Lazy.  And shiftless.  There's plenty of jobs you could do.  The world needs hat models.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  And God, the miles.  Just because it takes you a little longer to get out of bed, you want people to send you 
[02:42:30]  money.  Absolutely.  Why don't you take those pristine sneakers and get a job?  Those scufflish shoes.  God, give me thanks to this guy.  You got lucky lately, Fred?  Any chicks or any guys?  Oh, nothing.  No, you're just jacking it, huh?  I'm so dry.  He came up with one of the greatest quotes of all time on this show, Mr. Gaffigan. 
[02:43:00]  He had a guy bang him in the ass.  Right, right.  Not because he's gay, but because he was desperate.  He was desperate.  Well, you know, the guy hasn't had companionship in many, many years.  I don't do it anymore.  So his quote was, I'm not gay, I'm just desperate.  So he went to the local corner convenience store and found some young guy and somehow  convinced him to come over to his apartment where he then, the guy picked him up out of  the wheelchair, threw him on the bed, pulled his pants down, and had anal sex with him. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  Maybe that's what he needs the $600 for.  Yeah?  To get, what, a higher caliber of guy?  How awful is that when you're going to get laid and you open, and you know, like the  convenience store, bell clinkle, like the clink-a-link, and you look in, and there's  a guy in a chair, and you're like, all right, I'll fuck him.  And then you come back out, the clink-a-link-a-link.  You've got to wheel him.  You've got to wheel him home.  Up the gravel driveway.  He's got a cranky ass.  Oh, pull the pants down over those old turnip legs. 
[02:44:00]  I'll get the door.  Hasn't wiped his ass since 1984.  He just undo the belt, and the pants just fall to the shoes immediately?  There's none of that pesky calf muscle to stop him?  Oh, he's tried to wipe his ass since 1984.  Oh, P.  What?  What happened?  That's what I must say.  I'm very clean.  Oh, you're very clean.  He's very clean.  He wipes his ass.  He has to just lift his cheek a little bit, and he probably wipes from the back forward.  Ah, it gets all over his nutsack.  Under his bag, yeah.  No, I don't.  This bag looks like a skunk's back, like a photo negative of a skunk back. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, can I give thanks to this guy here?  What?  I want to give thanks to this person.  He inspired me to come back.  He wants to give you, so you went back to the store.  This guy inspired me to come back on the air.  This guy inspired you to come back on the air?  Yeah, Mark McCullin. 
[02:45:00]  Why did Mark get you to come back on the air?  He just called me and do it.  He just said, what if I was?  According to Kevin, if we all send a dollar, he'll have $8,000 to $9,000.  Yeah.  If we do the Russ Martin math.  Hey, Fred, don't you get disability?  Yeah, but that's not enough.  Not enough?  What do you need? 
[02:45:30]  I'm making $800 a month.  We couldn't pay.  $800.  I thought it was $600.  Yeah, I thought it was $600.  It was a few years ago.  Oh, it went up.  Inflation.  I got you.  Yeah.  Why don't you join, like, the Murderball League or something?  Do something.  We should get Ben in here, because Wheelchair Fred emails everyone basically saying he's  not going to do the show anymore unless he gets paid, and he just keeps writing emails 
[02:46:00]  saying that.  Yeah.  And then eventually he just calls the show because he realizes we don't care.  We're not going to give him money.  Right.  Fred, you would just spend the money, and then you would need more money.  Of course.  No, you're not.  Give a man a fish.  You should pimp out that.  That's right.  You should pimp out that ass of yours.  He'll shove it up his ass.  Well, I don't want to do this for nothing or do for something.  You would.  What?  I didn't catch that one.  You would. 
[02:46:30]  I don't want to do this for nothing.  Oh, you don't want to do this for nothing.  You don't want to do what for nothing?  Don't be witty.  What?  Be witty.  Be witty and be on the radio.  So you don't want to do the radio for free?  Yeah.  All right.  Jim Gaffigan in studio.  I mean, not that Fred's not a valued asset.  Yeah.  He has legs like wasp antennas. 
[02:47:00]  I guess that's the end of Wheelchair Fred.  That's it.  He told us.  It's like my brain hurts.  I'm trying to understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to learn how to speak, Fred.  You kind of do get used to it after a while, and you can pick out words and stuff.  But he wants money.  He wants money for his contributions.  Amazing.  $600.  What kind of...  Imagine sending in a requisition for $600 to XM for Fred. 
[02:47:30]  One dildo up ass.  600 clams.  Yeah, I would love to send in that expense report.  $19 for parts and $581 for labor.  Right.  Fred's in the union.  Yeah.  Priceless.  He has told some of the greatest stories on this show, though.  Describing how he brought this guy home and how this guy banged him up.  How do you just swap a cripple?  So he paid the guy, right?  I don't think so.  I think the guy just wanted to get laid.  Right.  And Fred was there. 
[02:48:00]  I don't know.  How did they strike up a conversation?  How do you go from getting a slurpee to getting a dick in your ass?  He can go to a store.  He's got a very strong upper body.  He's not actually paralyzed.  His legs got so mangled in the accident, and he had no...  It's kind of a sad story.  He had no health insurance.  He never got them fixed.  Yeah, so it's not his spine.  And now his legs are all passed up.  He's not a complete paraplegic.  No.  He's not paralyzed at all.  It's just his legs are so mangled.  And his voice box has been messed up. 
[02:48:30]  Got crushed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, all right.  He's completely there.  I thought he was in one of those beds.  See?  That'd be perfect.  No, he's in a wheelchair, so he just wheels around.  He goes to the store.  I feel if we pay Wheelchair Fred, we would be enabling him.  Yeah, we don't want to be enablers.  Yeah.  No.  Absolutely not.  Can't somebody fix his legs already?  You would think.  Just re-break them.  Just do something.  Just do something together the right way.  Something.  Put some pins in there.  That always works, right?  What was the accident?  A motorcycle accident?  Yeah.  Motorcycles.  Some woman turned right in front of his bike. 
[02:49:00]  He used to be like Tough Guy Biker.  We learned something.  We were at the X Games broadcasting live, talking to all these hardcore motocross guys  that have lost their spleens and kidneys racing, and none of these guys will ride bikes  on the highway.  No, they say that's crazy.  They said that's for crazy people.  That's like Murderball, a bunch of those guys.  Yeah.  Motorcycle accidents.  Yeah.  You've got to be a nut to ride a bike on the street.  These guys are doing some crazy stuff at the X Games, but when it comes to just driving  their motorcycle on the highway, they will not do it.  That's funny. 
[02:49:30]  I think we only got one guy.  We talked to a lot of guys all afternoon.  I think only one guy actually rides a motorcycle on the highway.  And they're launching themselves off of ramps, going 50 feet in the air, leaving the motorcycle,  getting back on it, and hitting the dirt.  I think it's interesting how motorcycles are like, the people that ride motorcycles are  bikers, but people that ride bikes are cyclists.  And how they both ride bikes, but they're completely different.  How they ride bikes are called faggots.  They're like, Big Gus, would you like to go for a 75-mile bike ride with us? 
[02:50:00]  If I can add a motor to my bike, and maybe wear a Nazi helmet, and bring my pregnant girlfriend.  You want to see a funny sight, go to Central Park around 6 in the morning and see all the  Lance Armstrong wannabes.  They're all dressed in their yellow.  They're all dressed in their biking outfits, and they race each other at 6 a.m. before  work.  What did I say wrong?  No, I'm saying if you want to see a funny sight, I'm saying if you want to see a funnier  sight, go at 3 a.m. and watch a white girl jog around 110th Street. 
[02:50:30]  The laughs will ensue.  But these guys all get together in the morning before work to race around Central Park in their  biking outfits.  And they're state-of-the-art bikes.  And they get mad if you're in their way.  Everyone's wishing wheelchair Fred good luck, bro.  Hello?  Yeah.  Who's this?  Dane Cook.  Hey, Dane.  Hey, were you calling the show tonight?  Good morning.  That's what I've been, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  We were supposed to have Dick Cavett on, and it's Dane Cook.  D.C.  Right?  Maybe we just had the spelling wrong.  No, I'm not on the show.  I'm just checking in.  Dane, you're going to come in and hang with us soon, right?  Yeah.  I'm coming in there for some gigs in September, so hopefully I'll come through and sit with  you boys.  Another armored car scheduled to pull up to your house and dump off another load of cash  with your CD selling like crazy?  What is it, 85,000 copies already?  Yeah, the first week. 
[02:51:30]  That was bananas.  You know, all the comics, we're all happy for you.  It's like, Dane, Dane is bigger than Jesus.  Yes.  Dane is so gigantic.  But he's pretty funny.  Dane is blowing up.  Yeah.  The name of the CD, Dane.  Retaliation.  Yes.  And this is what I'm going to tell you.  I got a copy just before we went to L.A., and I watched the DVD on the plane.  I loved it.  Oh, thanks, bro.  Thanks, bud.  Absolutely loved it.  I got a little confused, because there was a promo for Torgasm. 
[02:52:00]  Is that going to be a whole different project?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Torgasm is going to, Torgasm is something.  It's in the works right now.  We're throwing all the footage together.  Plenty of stuff of Robert Kelly.  Yeah, because he threw a five-minute montage of stuff from Torgasm.  Yeah.  And I'm like, well, I thought he was going to have this on the DVD.  I got a little confused, that's all, because that looks like it's going to be an amazing  project, too.  Yeah, yeah, Torgasm is, there was just so much stuff that, obviously, we knew we'd never  get it done for that release, so we're trying to hack it all together now. 
[02:52:30]  Cool.  Yeah, you got the Bob Kelly breaking his leg footage in that one.  I heard all the videos and all the things that the people did with the sound effects.  Oh, yeah, they made songs about it.  You should throw some of those remixes on a CD.  That would be really funny.  I get Bob, and then I get, you know, now I've got new answer machine messages of Bobby  being like, dude, they ruined me, dude. 
[02:53:00]  Kid, kid, they ruined me, dude.  Hey, Dan, is he out there right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just saw Bobby last night.  Okay, is he out there for a while?  I think he's out here for like 10 days.  I know, because I know he went out to L.A.  That's how unimportant Bob is to me.  I didn't know he was gone until he IM'd me and said, I'm in L.A.  I'm like, all right, well, that's fine.  The first thing he said to me, he goes, you know, dude, I miss Norton.  He really does.  Bob's a lonely idiot.  He has very few friends.  He has you and a few other guys from Boston, Patrice and guys that know him, and maybe me, 
[02:53:30]  because I used to live in his building.  It was just like a location thing.  No one likes Bob.  Does Patrice still do comedy, or is he on a two-year Brazil hiatus?  He really is.  Patrice is just an aloof asshole.  He wants to come into the cellar anymore.  He just kind of sits in Jersey on his fuck toy.  Yeah, he's just a sexual addict.  On his fuck toy.  What's his fuck toy?  That swing?  He's just polishing his glass dildo.  Yeah, he's just a sexual psychopath and a lonely man.  He has a whole briefcase of glass dildos.  Yeah, that he brings in and talks about each one and how he uses it on these Brazilian women. 
[02:54:00]  How one of them was a little upset with this whole situation of him and the dildo,  and he had to pat her stomach and say, come on, come on.  Because that's what they say in Portuguese.  It was so frightening.  Just this big, fat Patrice just saying, come on.  Come on, come on.  And he did get her off.  I've got to say, he was a master at work.  Did he?  He does it well, but just it was so awful.  Him kneeling in his big, awful sweatpants,  just lacking any human connection with this fucking person laying with her legs open. 
[02:54:30]  Like a sexual witch doctor.  Look, I'll make you feel good.  I just think that the visual of Patrice traveling around like he was a salesman in the 1800s  with his elixirs and schematics.  Elixir.  This is guaranteed to grow hair.  And remove all self-esteem.  We haven't had him in a while.  He's got to get in here.  By the way, a lot of people don't know, but Dane Cook's CD, I'm going to give it a plug.  It's being sold now at eatabullet.com.  You can purchase it there. 
[02:55:00]  Danecook.com is your site?  Yeah, right.  Selling out arenas.  Fucking.  Yeah, what are you doing in the city, man?  You're doing a big gig in the city.  Yeah, we're doing two shows over at the theater at Madison Square Garden.  Jesus.  Are you running for president, Dane?  You should run.  Yeah, dude.  This is, I mean, definitely the last couple of,  I kind of saw the Forest of the Trees went after Harmful came out,  because I dropped that, and it was like, you know, okay, this is cool. 
[02:55:30]  I'm getting like a, you know, I thought I'd just sell it independently.  You know, through the website, and you know, what will be, will be.  And then when Comedy Central Records kind of came to fruition,  and we're like, yeah, we're going to start putting out comedy records again.  And the first thing they said is they're like, yeah, the comedy record is dead,  but we're just, you know, we're just doing it as, you know, kind of promotional tools.  And, you know, you just didn't see it coming.  But the thing that really happened, especially with Retaliation the last week,  is just, you know, all these fucking comedy fans, man, 
[02:56:00]  just people who are just real diehard fans of just stand-up,  just stand-up comedy connoisseurs, and people writing me like,  oh, God, you know, so glad this fucking came out.  And it's just, you know, honestly, the last week has been,  it's like, I feel like I've been accepting an award.  It's like, hey, thank you.  I just want to thank the fans.  It's just really cool, man.  So I look forward to coming back there and doing that theater show.  Is the first one sold out? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Congratulations.  I think five of them are sold out, aren't they?  That's like 5,000 seats, man.  That's a lot of fucking people.  I think two of them sold out before advertising even started, right, Dan?  That's a lot of people, man.  It must be nice to play a place that doesn't have ha-ha in the phone number.  I know.  Every fucking dump I work, the owner actually answers the phone  and takes your name down with a pen.  Hey, dude, did you, I mean, if you're doing, I mean, you're doing two shows.  I mean, that's roughly 10,000 people you're going to have. 
[02:57:00]  Did you debate actually just doing the garden itself?  Like, I mean, it's not crazy that you could do that.  Yeah, I mean, we're definitely, you know, we're going to add a third one,  and it's just, you know, we did actually look into can we move it next door  because when we did the, again, the tourgasm thing,  we did a couple of stadium situations that were, you know, 10,000 plus.  So, you know, if it's possible, then, you know, we'd move it over.  But I think I'm just going to add this third show, and then we'll see what happens. 
[02:57:30]  When is the exact date?  Those are 15th and 16th of SEPT.  Okay.  So you're going to come in and hang with us, right, Dane?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I definitely, I'd love to be in there.  Well, we should play a track off your CD.  What do you suggest?  Play the Super Bleeder.  Super Bleeder.  It's a quick track.  Track three.  All right, cool.  We'll do that.  All right. 
[02:58:00]  We've got Jim Gaffigan in the studio, so we're going to let you go.  We're going to have you in the studio soon, though, right?  Fellas, I would love to swing by there and hang with the boys when I come through town.  Awesome.  It's Dane Cook.  The CD is retaliation selling like hotcakes.  Like hotcakes, Opie?  And it actually comes with a bonus hotcake.  Yeah, that would be funny.  Pour some syrup on it.  All right, Dane, we're going to go to break with this track, and we'll see you soon, all  right?  You got it, guys.  Same in.  Dane Cook, everyone. 
[02:58:30]  We laugh, but we love violence in this country.  We like violence.  We have those little violent tendencies.  I'm not the only person.  I know you're like me.  When you see somebody walking down the street wearing a Superman T-shirt, you just want to  shoot them in the chest.  When they start to bleed, you go, I guess not.  Don't wear the shirt.  Wear a shirt that says, I bleed if you shoot me in the chest plate, and I will not shoot  you in the chest plate.  Super bleeder.  I called him super bleeder. 
[02:59:00]  Ben's hog is just big enough for my baby.  Well, I do have big tips, goddammit.  God damn it, what nice tips.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Is that true? 
[02:59:30]  Dane, the first to break the top five on the Billboard 200 with a comedy album since Steve Martin  with a wild and crazy guy.  Yeah.  How about that?  Hi, we're back.  Yeah.  Got Jim Gaffigan in studio. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Little Jimmy Norton.  And Opie.  There he is.  I'm barely here today.  What's the problem?  Your neck, right?  Oh, my God.  My neck.  Oh, my God.  I was injured exercising, waiting for Charlie in the shuttle.  She's had some other line today.  Like, oh, I'm so happy he's back, and never again.  I'm not going through this anymore.  Her son's an astronaut, the guy up on the shuttle, and she's the mother from Queens, and she is now 
[03:00:30]  saying, no, you are not allowed to do any more astronauting.  I worry too much.  The news had her on every day just talking about, I'm very worried, and she talked like  that guy from the Jerky Boys.  Very worried indeed.  I just want him back here on Earth, not up in that flying tin can space shuttle.  Some infernal machine.  He could get injured. 
[03:01:00]  Here's actual audio of her.  He's very, very sure that everything is fine.  He's very happy, and he said everything is great.  We expect him back next Monday.  We expect him back.  Like, she's got to fill the world in on when the shuttle's supposed to come back.  We expect him back Monday.  I have spaghetti and meatballs for him when he gets home, and he's got to help his father  with the lawn.  She sounds like Susie Essman, a character of hers. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, she was the news's darling.  They loved her.  All right, Anthony, we got more audio from the Marco and Aaron show.  Everyone's looking for the golden ticket.  That's right.  We have golden tickets to give away, Jim.  Yeah.  We're going to, like, save a bunch of shows from commercial radio.  Yeah.  And we're going to bring them to satellite radio.  We gave out the first golden ticket to our pals Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  And they debut September 12th on 202. 
[03:02:00]  And other people starting to catch on, and they're sending in their shows for us to listen.  To listen to and see if they are worthy of a golden ticket.  Of a golden ticket.  Or the fuck-o list.  Yeah, we have a fuck-o list, too.  What happens to the fuck-o list?  They're just on it, never to be given a golden ticket and the opportunity to be on satellite radio.  It's like, here's your list, fuck-o.  That's right.  Those people.  Real harsh words here.  Those people have to just rot.  Yep.  On commercial radio. 
[03:02:30]  So, we listened to the Marco and Aaron show earlier.  They're so bad, we needed more audio of these guys.  What city are they out of?  They do some kind of cable internet radio show.  Cable?  How do you get cable radio?  First of all, you need Comcast cable, and then they have some kind of internet section that does radio shows.  If you're there, and you have the opportunity to see the radio with pictures, which is television, why are you then using it? 
[03:03:00]  I just don't get it.  Oh, my God.  Whoa!  Oh, my God.  Our children look different.  Please don't stare.  I really feel about it.  And your family loves you for you.  Son, Mari.  High school was rough for you?  No.  Up until, like, the middle of my senior year, it was hard.  Once I became a cheerleader, I was...  Stop it!  A cheerleader!  Stop it!  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Applaud.  Give me an A!  Give me an A!  Give me an S!  Give me a K! 
[03:03:30]  Did I spell math wrong?  We said A!  I said A twice!  Started with A!  Give me an S!  All right, why am I a comedian?  Those classrooms, until she became a cheerleader, were filled with pain.  And this is the way it went.  Here we go.  Yeah.  I haven't set Clinton's high school.  Since my senior year.  That's a nice body.  And the last time I knew was when I graduated, six years ago.  That's the locker I was pushed into when I was in high school.  What's wrong with her face? 
[03:04:00]  Everything.  This looks a locker that my head picked.  A thousand and one times since being in my senior year.  Why would they...  It's hard to be back here.  Just look...  Sitting the locker.  It's hard.  I remember walking through the hall.  Ugh.  What are they blurring out?  Her nipple.  Is there nipple popping out?  It's not Halloween for me.  Oh my God.  The one redeeming part of her, they block it.  That would kill me.  This room brings back so many memories.  That's the bathroom.  Wow.  Yeah, her nipples totally popping through that shirt. 
[03:04:30]  This is where I hid.  Is that from an accident?  I hid.  She looks like scarred or something.  She's a big fibroma.  What?  I'm in the basement.  It's just all of us.  I don't know.  Her jaw is huge.  It's a great body, though, man.  There's a lot of bad things that are happening.  Huge jaw and a big tongue, it looks like, right?  Gum teeth all up in the air.  The pain.  But look, she's got like a scar on her neck.  I don't want to go through the heart.  I don't want to go through the heart.  I wish I had the opportunity to fill this auditorium with everyone that made fun of me. 
[03:05:00]  This sounds like Marco.  I would tell each and every one of them that I did not deserve to be made fun of pushing  the lockers and teams because I am.  Yeah.  Oh, you go, girl.  Don't you think you deserve it?  Go, girl.  Wow.  I brought to the surface.  Very painful memories.  Looks like she's swallowed an M-80 hors d'oeuvre.  No.  What is the point of this show?  Maury Povich, by the way.  Except for Maury just capitalizing off.  That's what it is. 
[03:05:30]  Maury is Barnum and Bailey of the new century.  He brings people on.  It's a freak show every day.  And it's under the guise that he's helping them.  I am a journalist and science major.  I love politics.  I love journalism.  I would love to be an intern in TV and production.  Really?  Oh.  In production?  I'd love to be an intern.  Get my coffee.  We have a surprise.  Old steam shovel jaw.  A surprise.  Here comes a surprise.  Hi, Christy.  We're the Maury Show interns. 
[03:06:00]  And we want to show you just how much fun we have.  We love to read mail from our Maury viewers.  Things like smiling and chewing gum.  Where's my bagel?  And club soda.  Maury Show.  Maury Show.  Maury Show.  Maury Show.  They're going to give her an internship with the Maury Show?  Show's producers.  Okay, hi, hi, hi.  Listen, we're about to start the drag queen show.  I need a wig, a size 20, pink thong, and duct tape.  Is that what we asked of our interns?  That wasn't staged. 
[03:06:30]  No.  No.  In fact, we're looking for one more person to help us out.  And if you want the job...  I didn't know if Harry was also interning over at Maury.  Preferably one who...  Oh, she's crying.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  She looks even prettier when she cries.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, blow me down.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm an intern.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  They should have got her an intern in the Klan. 
[03:07:00]  Before I know, let's see a dumb face.  Oh, shit.  I'm a lot.  You've got to be kidding.  She said, she goes, I want to be a journalist.  Oh, my God.  She got no arms.  This is the next one.  It's the Maury Freak Show.  You don't have any arms.  I'm still the diamond.  And that there's nothing under the sun she can't do.  There's a lot of things she can't do.  It is so disfigured that she never leaves her house. 
[03:07:30]  You know, I've been in the mirror sometimes.  I see myself as a monster.  Yeah, well, I want more.  They, it's, look.  If you took these same people and put them under a tent and charged people to come in,  it would be a freak show.  Right.  It's the same thing.  He's just parading these freaks around on his stage.  The island of Dr. Maury.  I love how on Oprah, Oprah gives these real gifts, and then Maury just hires them with  free jobs.  Now you can work for me for free. 
[03:08:00]  For nothing, sweetheart.  Get me my coffee.  I'd like to be a journalist.  You can work for me.  Getting my coffee.  How about a dribble cup?  One cup of coffee.  Coming up.  The big jaw and one eye is shut.  Give me some spinach.  Horrid.  Horrid.  Who she looks like.  That old no arms is coming on next. 
[03:08:30]  That's great.  We're supposed to sit here and not laugh?  I know.  Well, no arms.  What's your story?  Well, I've been raped 445 times.  Maury's been doing this act, and it's been working for him.  We had him on our show once and asked him, I was like, Maury, what are you doing?  You just, you parade around freaks on your show. 
[03:09:00]  It's a freak show.  He admitted it.  Under the guise, and he's like, hey.  He said something like, hey, I've got to make a living.  He knows what he's doing.  He doesn't have.  You think he cares about this woman?  You think he hangs out with the Pejoria kids after the taping?  Yeah.  That's it.  Maury, you said you were going to set up a whole softball team for us kids with Pejoria.  Get away from me, you little fucker.  You give me the creeps.  We're done with you.  He hid them in his office once.  He had these little Pejoria kids, and they were real little.  And as a gag, he had one in his trash can. 
[03:09:30]  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  One in his drawer.  And he's like, where's Mindy?  Where's Mindy?  And he'd go, is she in here?  To show how little they are.  And he'd open up his drawer.  That's the right.  Hi, Maury.  And this alien, this thing that was dropped off from a fucking spaceship, is in his drawer.  And then he's like, where's Billy?  Billy, I hear you.  I don't see you.  I'm in the trash can, Maury.  He's in the fucking garbage can.  In the garbage can. 
[03:10:00]  How funny it would be if one of the workers just dumped it out in the big bin and rolled  him into the dumpster, compacted him with the rest of the trash.  What about the one on the shelf?  Yeah, and one was sitting on the shelf like a bookend.  Like a bookend.  Where's little Shelly?  Here I am, Maury.  That's right.  Right behind the Da Vinci code.  You're not doing that to help people.  It's a freak show.  Look how tiny this is.  Look how tiny this little person is.  And he acts like he cares, but then the show's over, and I think he's kicking him to the curb. 
[03:10:30]  I'm out of here.  How perfect that garbage can was.  Get all five of them in there.  Oh, my God.  That's the biggest laugh I've had in a long time.  Leave it for the foreigner to take out.  Tie up the bag.  Hey, wait.  We're in here.  The Baduria kids are classic, though.  They want to just be like regular kids.  Now, you're eight years old, aren't you?  You're just like any other eight-year-old boy, but you're in the body of a 68-year-old man.  That's right, Murray. 
[03:11:00]  I like playing ball.  You know, go out there, swing the bat a little bit.  Anything that a normal kid does.  A normal kid that looks like he was born in Chernobyl and grew up on Three Mile Island and now live in Love Canal.  70s reference.  I like that.  Oh, please.  Look at what it is.  Our children look different.  Please don't stare.  Yeah, because if you stare, it's one person looking at you as opposed to a few million on television.  Because she contacted us about somebody very special in her life. 
[03:11:30]  And this person is her 14-year-old sister Diamond.  She had a contact.  This one can't pick up the phone.  Because Diamond was born with no arms.  But it doesn't stop this young teen from living a normal life like other girls her age.  Unless normal is doing cartwheels.  Now, let me tell you, it was no coincidence that Diamond was named after a precious stone.  She was?  When I first laid eyes on my daughter Diamond, she was the most beautiful baby you would ever want to see.  The name Diamond fit her perfectly. 
[03:12:00]  She named her Broken Watch because she has dogs.  And my parents treated me the same as any other child would ever be treated.  When I was little, my parents did everything for me.  I remember them throwing the best birthday parties and taking me to see Santa on Christmas.  I was Santa.  What do you want?  What do you think, Fatso?  What do you want besides not nitten?  When my sister Deja was born, I was so happy because I had someone to play with.  My big sister is special because she helps me do a lot of things and she's my role model. 
[03:12:30]  She's nice.  She makes me laugh.  And even though she doesn't have arms, she doesn't let it get her down.  Sometimes I'm sad because she doesn't have arms and she can't do things that I can do.  But I'm happy because that's my best friend and I don't know what I'm doing.  But shoot, she's naked.  She doesn't have arms, I still love her and I'll do that for my sister to give her.  That was true.  That was true.  Are those tears of joy, happiness? 
[03:13:00]  Yes, Maureen.  Because?  It just touches my heart to hear how my younger daughter speaks so highly of her older sister.  She's nice.  And how much of a great she is to her.  Not only her, but myself.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, that's right.  Let's parade her out here.  Let's get that human-shaped lounge out here.  Oh, shit.  When they make fun of her, I think it's bad because she's like...  Bring on the walking surfboard. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  Yes, she is.  Yes, she is.  Let's bring her out.  How does she wipe her crack?  Really?  With her feet?  A bidet, maybe?  Do you scoot on the rug?  Scoot on.  Oh, she's sweeping.  They've shown her sweeping with her feet and ironing.  All of them can do that.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jim's so unimpressed.  All of them can do that.  Why don't you stand up here and be the big television host and introduce the world to 
[03:14:00]  your big sister, Doug?  She's eating with her feet.  Maury Povich has to be part Satan.  He absolutely is the worst man ever.  Here she comes, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  She looks like she's cold all the time.  It does.  She does absolutely look blue screened.  You're right.  You want to hug your little sister?  Hug your little sister.  You want to hug your sister?  Exactly.  Just put your face awkwardly in a hurry. 
[03:14:30]  She said you want to hug your little sister.  She's got no fucking arms, Maury.  What do you think of that?  What do you think of your little sister?  I think that she's just wonderful.  Your sister talks about she doesn't want anybody treating you any different than anybody else.  Do you ever get sad?  Jesus, I'm a rapper.  If you don't want me to touch your tits, slap my hand away.  Exactly.  Does it bother you that when you lift your head, candy falls out of your neck?  When you are reading it for the first time, and see the way you are, we're saying ourselves 
[03:15:00]  to remember what a day is like in the life of Diamond.  So we went to her home.  Of course you did.  And we watched Diamond go through the day.  Because part of a freak show is watching the freaks do an act.  With no arms, she begins her day just like everyone else.  No.  I don't shut off my alarm clock with my foot.  I come to the bathroom and brush my teeth.  It may not be with my real hands.  Brushing her teeth with her feet.  And it all gets done the same way.  Great.  Like many teen girls her age, Diamond likes to look her best. 
[03:15:30]  And that means doing all she can to look good.  She's putting an earring with her foot.  Diamond needs help from her sister to complete her overall look.  I like helping my sister get ready to go to school in the morning.  And I love her and I'll do anything for her.  What is she doing?  She's taking a dump at school.  Yeah.  Determined to live a normal lifetime.  Oh my gosh.  She's up on the counter making peanut butter and jelly with her feet.  With her feet.  She makes herself at home in the kitchen and fixes lunch. 
[03:16:00]  But don't underestimate this amazing chef.  She's cooking with pots and pans on the stove with her feet.  She's making mush and cuticles.  Anybody want some?  They know that I can do almost everything that they do.  So to them there's no difference.  I'll have some of the athletes corn.  Waiter, there's a sock in my suit.  Oh, is that horrid? 
[03:16:30]  I feel like I'm going to take a shower.  Isn't that horrible?  Wow.  You know, we make no solutions as to what we're here for and where we're headed.  We're trash.  Maury is more despicable than...  It's like t-ball for you guys.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Tee it up.  Maury is actually under the guise of helping these people.  Let's show her doing things.  Show her brushing her teeth with her feet.  You want some more of this?  Yeah.  How much footage you got?  Hug your sister.  Take more.  Make her do things with her feet. 
[03:17:00]  Make her eat with her feet.  I don't care if she doesn't really do it.  We can do the peanut butter sandwich.  How about something hot?  Cook something in the pot.  Stir around some mush.  Grab a meatball, you little jig.  This isn't good for the ratings.  All right.  Back to our show, the Marco and Aaron show.  Golden tickets we were talking about, right?  Yes, we were.  And Marco and Aaron were brave enough to send in some samples, examples, whatever, of their 
[03:17:30]  radio show that they do on cable television.  It's like some kind of cable radio show.  And it's so bad that we needed to hear more.  Uh-huh.  So here, without further ado, is Marco and Aaron talking about crime scene sex.  But you were hopeful you were going to get something.  I'm not going to.  Dude, she was on the rack, man.  There's other things you can do when they're on the rack.  Exactly.  You can put your finger in a butthole.  Hey, you can get a Hummer.  That's true.  You can get a Hummer.  Get your little knob sucked. 
[03:18:00]  What's wrong with that?  Some people like it messy, though.  Exactly.  The crime scene sex.  Sorry, man.  Not me.  Who doesn't like crime scene?  Everyone likes a little crime scene sex.  I mean, look.  I know it's bad and it smells raw.  I don't like chunks on my jokes.  You guys had crime scene sex before, right?  Actually, I passed.  You passed.  I sure have picked up on the language.  You never had crime scene sex?  You're effing lying.  Hold on.  In the heat of passion, yeah, yeah.  You have crime scene sex.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You know.  It's not good.  Dude, I don't know.  Wow, that is exceptionally bad. 
[03:18:30]  Wow.  That poor girl.  I can't stop thinking about her.  I know.  People keep throwing dishes on her because they think she's an armless war.  Oh, she wanted to joust, but she didn't have a suit of armorless.  We got a problem, kids. 
[03:19:00]  Who's this?  Who's this?  Yeah, Opie, Nancy, and Jimmy.  Yeah, who's this?  This is Bob, the trucker.  Hi, Bob.  Hi, Bob.  I list you.  I'm a new subscriber to XM.  I list you guys every day.  Welcome.  Man, it's really sick what you guys are doing.  Oh.  Why is that?  Do you guys have any kids?  Let me ask you a question before you go on.  I do have a kid.  Let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you a question.  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  Go ahead.  Maury Povich is exploiting these kids for ratings and parading them on television. 
[03:19:30]  What we're doing is just making fun of it, but we're not the ones putting them on television  or exploiting them.  So the real sick thing is Maury doing what he does.  The parents are just trying to get some kind of closure.  It's not what we're doing.  You're right.  He's sick, too.  I don't even watch Maury.  But, man.  You're missing some good TV today.  If I had two...  I've got two kids, and if either one of them was born like that, it would just be a crying  thing.  I do not.  Please.  I absolutely know.  I mean, what do you think pillows were made for? 
[03:20:00]  It's just...  You guys can find something else to make fun of.  I mean, that's real bad.  So we're...  You're not making fun of old golf tee.  Did you like any of them?  Look, I didn't mean to make fun of the human toilet snake.  I mean, that was inappropriate.  All right.  What goes around comes around, guys.  No, it doesn't.  Really?  What did Dana Reeves do besides care for her husband and then get fucking lung cancer?  Yeah.  What goes around comes around.  Does it really?  So where's her act of kindness from somebody?  Where? 
[03:20:30]  She's not dead yet.  Don't bury her yet.  Well, what has her kid Will done?  His father, he couldn't hug him for 10 years, and his mother now has lung cancer.  What goes around comes around.  Does it really?  Yes, it does.  So explain that to me.  Give her a chance.  Explain that to me.  Why they should have to deal with this.  It's idiotic what you're saying, dude.  There's no such thing as karma or any of that shit when you're joking about stuff.  Karma chameleon.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that cheers everybody up.  And we've made a lot of people's lives a lot happier.  So where's that karma?  That's right. 
[03:21:00]  Where's that karma?  Where is it?  That's right.  Where in the hell is it?  And I lied.  I don't have any kids.  I just wanted you to shut up for a second.  I hate kids.  Well, I hope that you do have kids.  It's just a little bit of armless humor.  Wait, the other one's up there.  I didn't want to go to this again, but since he called, I think we're obligated.  What is this one?  Her condition is so disfigured.  What goes around comes around.  Unless it's a boomerang, then you can't catch it.  Without covering her entire body.  She actually feels that she is too ugly to leave her home. 
[03:21:30]  Now she's backstage.  Races the point.  Wow.  And in just a few minutes, we're going to ask her to come out here.  I think in this case, she's pretty accurate.  So she can be in front of a public audience.  My gosh.  We're talking to her mother, Janice.  How long has it been since she's been out in public without covering herself up?  Well, it's been many years.  Long time now.  She's got quite a skin condition there.  She was 12, and now she's 22.  It looks like she should be in a Tim Burton film.  For at least 10 years. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  She comes.  It's a new thing called yucca derma.  But she covers herself up.  Yeah, in the summertime.  I told her not to swim in the Exxon station.  You're not embarrassed, are you?  About it.  No, I'm not embarrassed about her.  I just feel so sad and so sorry.  Really?  You're not?  Your fucking womb did that, stupid.  You should be embarrassed.  Close it.  I want to tell you.  I want to go back here.  Shut it.  I'm going to bring her out here.  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, Mario's going to go back and make it okay. 
[03:22:30]  Look at the line of shit he's going to give her.  Would it be funny when the next time he was with her he had gloves on?  How are you?  Good to see you.  Hi.  Give me a hug.  Yuck.  He touches the nurse.  Look at him touching her.  And he's got to do it very, like, he's touching.  He's rubbing her shoulder.  Some of my family hasn't seen me this way.  And a lot of my friends haven't seen me this way.  She's a burn victim.  Yeah.  That's all big, peeling, white spots all over.  In the audience.  It looks like she's got the vitiligo.  Last night, we asked Laura in a very private moment what it was like to be 22 years old and look so different than anybody else. 
[03:23:00]  Different.  Watch.  What is the music?  When I was 11 years old, it just came out of the blue.  Out of the blue.  All of a sudden, like a wildfire spread.  Ugh.  What does it cause for me?  I don't know.  My hands start to clutter.  I don't know.  Then my arms.  Then my legs start to get worse.  It's hard for me to walk some days.  Jesus.  When I look in the mirror sometimes, I see myself as a monster. 
[03:23:30]  Sometimes I worry that no one will be able to accept who I am and love me.  That's sad.  Who I am.  That's right.  Inside.  Some days I feel alone.  The hardest part for me is...  I had to finally stop sleeping in the crock pot.  See, my mom hurts because there's nothing that she can do to help me.  I mean, if I had a cold, she can give a cough medicine.  She couldn't baste you.  She...  Oh, barbecued chicken skin. 
[03:24:00]  She feels hopeless, and I do too sometimes.  That's the one thing that I want people to know about me is that I'm a good person.  Inside.  That's not what they did with me outside.  Ah!  Her face is unaffected, but man, it's creeping up quick.  Yeah.  It's creeping up.  I just see the pitch meeting where, like, Maury's like, all right, what do we got?  We got a woman with no arms.  We got a woman.  He goes, eh, she's not messed up enough. 
[03:24:30]  Not good enough.  Not the clincher.  Yeah, definitely.  They have meetings.  What do we got?  What do we got?  Maury kind of has some kind of strange smirk on his face, like, oh, this makes me look good.  Yeah.  Look at him touching her.  Look how good I am.  Yeah, look at me touching her.  Why is she just, her legs are so skinny, too.  Now, Janice, you don't know this, but your daughter has a special message for you.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to another video.  And she made it backstage.  Very important to make sure people cry. 
[03:25:00]  Dear Mommy, no words could ever express how thankful I am to have such a loving and giving mother.  We've cried so much throughout these trying years, but no matter how bad my days get, you're always right beside me to help me through.  But I couldn't get the right job to burn in for you.  You tell me that I'm beautiful, and you inspire me when I'm about to give up.  I love you so much, and I thank God every day, that of all the moms in the world, I got you.  Love, Lord.  Yeah, great.  That's lovely.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[03:25:30]  God loves you, baby.  Anything you want to tell your daughter?  I sometimes look at this, and I wonder if these kids even want to be on this show.  I know.  We're going to New York.  Yeah, we're going on Maury.  I don't want to do that.  Let's talk about your future, dude.  Because in between, during commercials, they put up the sign that says,  if your child has a debilitating disease or something that we can laugh at, call Maury.  And everybody's going to say, but if you'd like to draw, how do you do it?  Oh, stop.  That was awful. 
[03:26:00]  What, that awful dumb angel she did?  No problem?  No problem painting?  No problem.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  All the paintings have really nice hot chicks in them.  Who's that last one of?  All right.  That's sad.  She's the queen of long shirts and slacks.  Oh, my God.  And we got in the car and Alex cried.  What happened?  And I cried too.  And even though she looks different, she is great. 
[03:26:30]  She's just beautiful.  What the hell was that?  Oh, my God.  But she's not as beautiful.  I don't know what's happening.  God definitely has a sense of humor.  Sometimes.  She has twins.  One is perfectly normal and the other one.  The other one's E.  I can't watch this.  Look like a Jeep.  Look like a Jeep.  Look like the magical Jeep.  Come here, Jeeps.  All right.  Back to the Marco and Aaron show. 
[03:27:00]  Ah, right.  Crime Scene Sex Part 2.  These guys trying to get a golden ticket.  Now, what do they mean by crime scene?  Yeah, you have sex with the girl when she's on her period there, Jim.  Crime scene.  You know, the bed looks like perhaps it should have police around it and the yellow tape.  Smells like copper.  Somebody spilled Cherry Jubilee in my bed.  So, you never had the clown face?  Oh, you're well done.  The clown face?  That's some mess. 
[03:27:30]  Dude, you're going off the rock.  Well, for those who don't know what the clown face is, it's when you eat a girl out when  she's on the rag.  What, are we vampires here?  I know, dude.  I've never done it.  I just heard expressions of the clown face.  Yeah.  You guys never had sex.  Who is he kidding?  And to all our guests today, good luck, bro.  All right.  Jim Gaffigan doesn't know that story.  Oh, Opie, one of the last people to see Peter Jennings alive. 
[03:28:00]  I was just lucky enough to see Peter Jennings walking through the park one day with his daughter  and son right after he announced that he had the lung cancer and it was obvious that he  was going into hiding.  It was really bad.  Yeah.  And I never thought of that.  Words of wisdom.  I probably was one of the last people to see him.  And I saw him coming and I knew I had to say something and I had a lot of time to think.  I saw him slowly walking toward me and the best I could come up with was good luck, bro. 
[03:28:30]  Good luck, bro.  Something you'd tell your buddy the comic before he goes out on stage or something.  Good luck, bro.  That's amazing.  That's an exact quote.  Good luck, bro.  And the sad part is it wasn't like he just popped out of nowhere and, you know, you knew  you had to say, I had time to figure something out.  Let me think what he would want to hear.  He would probably want to be referred to as bro.  Bro.  Luck.  You could use some luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Keep it real.  Keep it real, bro.  Back to the Marco and Aaron show, Crime Scene Sex Part 3. 
[03:29:00]  It's bad enough that you can't have sex for three days.  No, you can, though.  See, that's the thing.  You've got to have equal opportunity, man.  No, that's the best time you can have sex with a girl because she's on the rag.  You can spew all over it because it's going to flow down.  No, no, that's not true.  Yes, it is.  It's like mixing colors.  You know, like yellow and green makes what?  Orange.  What does that make?  Orange.  Exactly.  Strawberry shortcake?  Your junk looks like a Cheeto after you come inside or something?  No, it just looks, look.  Because you've got the white and the red and it mixes around.  It's like an orange. 
[03:29:30]  Let me talk to a man that's had Crime Scene Sex.  Lou, Lou.  All right, hold on, hold on.  No, no, no.  Wow.  I don't even know what they're talking about.  I can't even take it.  With his speech impediment, Rob from Chicago, Bob from Chicago says,  Hey, leave old peel and eat alone.  You are a horrible man.  Let's say hi to Darren. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, wait, more.  Oh, no, no.  Hey, Darren.  Oof.  Hey, there.  Jesus.  What's up, Darren?  Yes.  What's up?  Am I on the air?  Yes, you're on the radio.  I'm sorry.  I had a quick question about the armless girl.  Do you think she feels that everyone on the roller coaster is taunting her when it's heading downhill?  Now, what is this girl about?  She's got a big cheek.  Is that what that is?  She's got tumors on the left side of her face. 
[03:30:30]  No, not this one.  What is it?  I got to know what she's got.  I didn't realize there was anything wrong until the baby was in my arms.  I can't watch this.  Are you having a baby?  We had no idea what extent of her problems were.  Yeah, that's pretty awful.  I was very scared.  Jesus, fix that.  There was much more involved than what we had thought originally.  She is the most beautiful little girl.  Ah, to you.  No, she's not.  And we have never grasped what the public has seen when they look at our little girl. 
[03:31:00]  We went to the store and the cashier told Alex she could take off her Halloween mask.  That cashier was Jimmy Norton.  She truly knew at that time that the public does see her as something different.  You could take off your Halloween mask.  She doesn't look like that.  I'm going to put some makeup on.  She does.  She looks...  And I cried too.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm blind.  I don't see it really.  I don't see it that bad.  She makes me feel happy. 
[03:31:30]  If I'm having a bad day, she just puts a smile on my face.  I love her to be moving back.  It's like seeing a kid.  It's like she didn't listen.  Why did she just go and dine a sleigh or something?  We didn't know that it was a health issue or a medical issue.  She was a large baby, so we assumed it was from going through the birth canal.  So I just assumed she was severely bruised.  Jesus.  What, he got a mine shaft in there with wooden beams?  And she broke her nose and you're cunt, did she?  Like, we didn't know, but later, I think most parents feel guilty. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Jim Gaffigan is horrified at this display.  Horrified.  She's a terrific girl.  She is.  Terrific girl.  You probably have a lot of pride in her.  Yes.  She's probably shown a lot of courage.  She is, and I think she's amazing if we didn't have to deal with the rest of the world.  Yeah.  We should all be as proud of her as you are, so let's meet her.  Here she is, your loving 13-year-old Alexander. 
[03:32:30]  Aw, poor little kid.  That's horrible.  It's not that bad.  No, it's not.  Boring.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  Well, that's what it's all about.  She's not that bad, so we don't give her the attention that she rightfully deserves.  Oh, yeah.  She's kind of messed up.  Back to the Marco and Aaron show.  Now they get to talk about jerking off at work.  Have you guys ever done the job whack?  You had the job, you just got to the bathroom.  I will make no comments on that. 
[03:33:00]  I need to wake up.  Exactly.  I'm falling asleep at my computer.  I'll be right back.  I've done the job whack.  That's when you know it's bad.  When you do the job whack.  Mine has always been, gosh, that customer was hot.  Jesus.  No, see, mine was for no reason.  I was just bored.  It was like a lunch break.  All right, enough of the Marco and Aaron show.  So they're going to get the golden ticket now.  She was crying, and he's wiping her tears off with a paint roller. 
[03:33:30]  Big face.  Terrible.  Oh, my God.  We've got some surprises.  Awesome surprises.  The people at Target are giving you a big back-to-school gift certificate.  You go to Target.  Great, that's what similar to the formula means.  Target.  We'll be right back.  Put it on your back.  So the children will know who to throw eggs at.  She looks different.  She is.  Wow. 
[03:34:00]  She's just beautiful.  That has to have a tail.  I would bet $100 that it has a tail.  Wow, that is something.  Jim Gaffigan has left the building, ladies and gentlemen.  I need some Wellbutrin.  Yeah.  Well, Jim's a parent.  I mean, it's different when you're a parent.  That is true.  None of us are parents.  Right.  We don't have children, and we will never have children.  We're souls.  If we had children, it would be an awful thing, because, you know, the Lord would be hovering 
[03:34:30]  there right at the delivery and just fuck it up.  You'd just zap a few of those crumbs.  Oh, awful.  You think it's funny?  Say hello to your armless, fucked-up face.  Burnt kid.

Did you guys see the story about the man jailed for molesting a sleeping woman on plane?  Jesus.  That's a bold move, man.  That is a ballsy-ass move.  There's no running from the scene if she's on to you.  Well, it goes back to that thing we started a while ago, the perv switch.  Yeah.  It happens in the dentist's chair, and some of these dentists all of a sudden just lose it, 
[03:36:30]  and that perv switch gets switched on.  You can't possibly think of the consequences.  You can't think, I'm going to throw away all the years of schooling that it took me to become a dentist in this minute.  You don't think of that.  It's just this primal, got to touch the tits!  Like, it just hits you where you don't think about anything else.  You just got to touch tits or diddle or something because she's so hot next to you.  And that's what you got to do.  And I guess that happened on the plane?  Yeah.  A business executive was sentenced on Thursday to seven years in prison for sexually assaulting. 
[03:37:00]  Seven years?  Wow.  Let me get these reports out.  I need the boss.  That's why I'm working on this flight.  Tits!  Got to touch them!  What did the guy do?  Was he in, like, business class or something?  It looks like he was in business class, Mr. Gaffigan, yes.  Seven years in prison for sexually assaulting a sleeping woman seated next to him on a Delta Airlines flight from Dallas to Boston.  A statement from the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts said that on April 5th, Deepak Shahagardar, 55, laid a blanket over the 22-year-old woman who was returning from a vacation. 
[03:37:30]  So he puts the blanket over, then he unfastens her seatbelt, unbuttoned her pants, and assaulted her by touching her genitalia.  Hell yeah.  Genitals.  He touched her genitals.  Wow.  That takes some guts.  That is a ballsy move.  That's insane.  On a plane.  But there was Secret Service agents on the plane. 
[03:38:00]  What?  And they said skin cells taken from Jahagardar.  Jahagardar.  An Arizona man whom authorities said did not know the woman showed a significant quantity of the victim's DNA was present on his hands.  Wow.  He was really just digging in with both hands?  He got knuckled deep.  How out was that lady?  Really?  Holy my God.  Unbuckled her belt, undid her slacks.  He just pulled her pantyhose down, drove a few fingers in.  What were the flight attendants doing?  Yeah.  Can I get you some coffee or a condom or some rubber gloves? 
[03:38:30]  That's something.  Wow.  What excuse do you have?  Just lost his mind.  I dropped my fork and I thought it fell on her pussy.  I roughly reached, because he must just reach his hand in there and I went, eh, eh, eh.  She went, eh, stop.  Big mitts.  Both of them.  The woman immediately pulled Jahagardar's hand from her pants and fled to the rear of the aircraft where she reported the assault to the flight crew. 
[03:39:00]  So, let's say hi to John.  What's up, John?  Hi, John.  Hey, not the heart, but when Maury has these deformed kids, they always interview the moms, never the dads.  Because you know the dads will be like, yo, Maury, this sucks.  There's no God.  My kid's not beautiful.  I love them, but this sucks, Maury.  It was her womb.  Yeah, exactly.  They never do it when you're the father.  Nah, the fathers don't want to go on these shows.  They probably ran off.  What's wrong with this kid?  She's pint-sized, but she's 30.  She's 30. 
[03:39:30]  How are you?  How are you?  Are you okay?  Here he goes.  Huh?  What are your favorite things to do?  I like to paint.  You like to paint?  Yeah.  Great.  Now, how about...  She has Turner Syndrome.  Ike beat her over the head a few times too many.  Serena.  Here's Serena, everybody.  Come on out, Serena.  Ah, the normal one.  Here, now we get the comparison.  That's a fun one.  It'll dance.  It'll look pretty.  Hi, Serena.  I'm sure she doesn't hate her sister every single day. 
[03:40:00]  That's called your twin was teething on your umbilical cord.  Come on over here and sit next to your sister.  They dress them in the same outfits.  Jesus.  What do you think of your sister?  She's a freak.  I mean, I love her.  Size zero and a size four in the same outfit.  I bet, Ariana, you love Serena more than anything else on earth, don't you?  No.  She isn't that bad.  You love dolls, don't you?  And, Ariana, what did you love to do more than anything?  You like to paint, don't you?  So, I have a few treats for you from BigFunToys.com. 
[03:40:30]  All right?  Here it is.  Let's bring it out.  Look at all that.  How about getting her some surgery, dickhead?  Look at all that stuff.  Yeah.  Poise.  Great.  Here's some color forms.  Kelly and Allie suffer from a condition called cherubism.  I don't think I'm pretty.  Cherubism.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Mari was telling her she's pretty, and she goes, I don't think I'm pretty.  Cherubism.  Oh, wow.  Her head is shaped like a pear.  Oh, I thought that's when you were born like Ben Sparks.  What does that say to a family member?  Looked like you should be running around with a fucking arrow, shooting people and make them 
[03:41:00]  fall in love.  Did a family member abuse you physically or sexually?  If so, call Mari.  That's what it is.  Unbelievable.  All right.  I don't know if we got anything accomplished today.  Oh, sure we did.  But we certainly had a good time.  We had a lot of laughs today.  We had a lot of laughs, Mr. Gaffigan.  That was funny.  Sorry I had to see that.  Let's go to Lips of Cum from Wackbag.  They all have nicknames.  What's his name?  Lips of Cum.  Lips of Cum.  Subtle.  Is that appetizing or what? 
[03:41:30]  Great.  I learned that a fish consists of head towards a tail.  Oh, that's right, Sidney.  Yes, no necks on fish.  Today we laughed at miscarriages and deformed children.  We are just shit.  Another night of no sleep for me.  Another wide-eyed, staring at the ceiling.  Is this really what you got in this business?  Pondering life.  Can you picture Richard Pryor doing this?  Laughing at deformed children?  No.  Do you guys realize we just did a radio show where we just... 
[03:42:00]  watch TV?  Well, for a little bit.  Look, this is a hang, man.  That's what people do.  We don't have structure.  That's right.  And then the music kicks in.  You want news?  Read the fucking paper.  It's going to go home.  What a drudge.  Why don't we play...  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Prozac from Wackbag.  What's up, Prozac?  Hello, men.  I learned Jimmy fucks at the Saturn Inn.  Yes.  And that Dr. Martin is available for abortion.  Hey, Opie, I hope your neck starts feeling better, my friend. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Thank you, sir.  Jim Gaffigan, you learned anything today?  I learned that watching Maury can really just make me feel like killing myself.  Yeah.  Maury is despicable.  I know we are, but he is just an awful human.  We're not carting him out and kissing him.  Yeah.  Or touching him, God forbid.  Yeah, there's something wrong with Maury.  Yeah.  Let's thank Tim from Springfield for stopping by.  Tim, great job.  He's the winner of the Assault in the Media contest for July, and he got to hang out all 
[03:43:00]  day.  Did you have fun, Tim?  Absolutely.  Waited 10 years for this.  This is the best.  You waited 10 years?  Dude, he was 14 when he started listening to us.  Wow.  In Massachusetts.  See, our listeners grow up normal.  Did Opie touch you?  Let's go to Dan in Ohio.  Dan?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I learned on the MMA show today, the yellow and green make orange.  That's right.  Paul in Jersey.  Paul, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that if you wash your hands after you piss, you get free chiclets. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to George.  George, what did you learn on the show?  It's terrible when the media exploits bad people.  More will to your friend.  All right.  Ben's raw ass.  Hey, guys.  I learned that Jim's couch is going to be delivered dented this afternoon.  I think so, too.  Punch that.  All right.  I want to thank Jim Gaffigan for being brave enough to stop by today.  Our friend.  And you've got 10 seconds.  You're going to be in Chicago?  Chicago, October 8th at the Vic Theater for a Comedy Central special. 
[03:44:00]  Ticketmaster.  Get tickets.  That's great, man.  No.  You'll be in the Anthony show. </pre>
