<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's Friday broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony discussing their upcoming Halloween party, transitioning into a meandering conversation about their complicated personal relationships and past romantic misadventures.  They recounted various Valentine's Days spent drinking instead of celebrating with partners, shared stories of disastrous gift-giving that resulted in fights, and detailed their own obliviousness to their exes' emotional needs, citing examples like botched attempts at romantic gestures (including a Greece trip).  A caller, Robin, expressed incredulity at their tolerance of their exes' past behavior.

The conversation then pivoted to a news story about divorce lawyer Dominic Barbara whose wife allegedly threw spaghetti at him, resulting in a police report and her arrest. This led to Opie and Anthony discussing their own experiences with divorce, focusing on the emotional stress and legal intricacies involved.

Studio guest Louis C.K. joined the show, and the conversation shifted to his comedy, including his approach to controversial material and audience reactions. They also discussed the business side of stand-up comedy, touching on the roles of agents and managers.

The broadcast concluded with the somber announcement that a significant staff member, Roland, was leaving the show due to a merger. Opie and Anthony expressed their sadness, shared anecdotes about Roland's contributions, and played a recording of Roland singing Ave Maria.

[00:10:00]  own homemade sauce or something for it and this is uh you know a lot of work went into it whatever  so we sit down and it the spaghetti didn't look right no uh it looked like it could have been maybe  a little wheat pasta yeah yeah color was a little off and i take one mouthful of this garbage  and uh just make a face like ugh ugh and uh with the both of them with this disappointed look on  their face go what i go what is this and she goes it's it's spaghetti squash yeah they made they made

[00:11:00]  horrid it was the worst meal i've ever had yeah and i was poor for many many years and i ate some  crap just to try to get some nutrition in me prison food it was horrendous and in between trying to  make believe we enjoyed it because they they put so much time and effort into it yeah and we're working  we're being shock jocks and we need like a nice nice big warm meal and we're just like just suffering 
[00:11:30]  through this meal because we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings because that's where aunt and i  are very similar and but we let the dog have it under the table we took out our frustration on the  yip-yap dog just just a horrid horrid dinner nothing nothing worked right we should have just known  right i was so like just really into the job and everything so it didn't like my whole life other  than doing the radio show yeah it didn't even matter yeah like i was all right i could deal with 
[00:12:00]  this because i know uh tomorrow i'll back on the air having fun doing bits i've been asked um a lot  not recently but a lot why did you why did you stay in that relationship so long know what my answer is  every time i don't know i i don't know and it would be so it would have been so much easier to come up  with a good reason yeah and my honest answer has always been i don't know yeah it's the same thing 
[00:12:30]  i swear i i would it would be so easy to go well this blah blah i i that was my answer which didn't  help early on in my you know this relationship i'm like i don't know i don't know why i think because  you and i were like you know rocking the the radio show and like we were just so involved with the  excitement of of building up this thing that is now the opian anthony show that all that crap just  didn't matter that was a big part of it there was another thing with me was uh you know my parents 
[00:13:00]  had gotten uh divorced and and at that point uh the three of us me you know my brother joe and and dawn  were all married at that point so i didn't want to be the old icebreaker and like have all my whole  family just looking going oh okay here it is following in the footsteps of his dad and everything  else can't can't stick it out can't make a marriage work so that kept me in it for a while too because i 
[00:13:30]  didn't want to you know get get the divorce and have that stigma on me from my family so i stuck it  out for a longer than i would have right yeah did i tell you i i have a story i've never told  tree house uh what was there a tree house  um young boy you you remember i went to greece right yes and i was like uh that that was the uh  that was pretty much the end of the relationship and uh we went on this amazing like greek uh journey 
[00:14:00]  to the islands and istanbul and i saw the acropped turkey oh yeah the acropolis i told them  parthenon no i told the muhammad story the other day where i saw a piece of muhammad's beard  yeah that trip but we ended up at the acropolis probably one of the most beautiful places on  earth the ruins at the top of the hill or whatever right yeah and we spent the afternoon there and  stuff this is how clueless i was and uh we're walking away and she's crying and i'm looking around 
[00:14:30]  like yeah it does bring tears to your eyes this is just an amazing sight isn't it one of like the  seven wonders of the world or if it's not it should be right up there but yeah this is just  amazing and it almost brought tears to my eyes too and i kind of realized as we were walking back to  the hotel that she probably told everybody back home that this was it oh oh no and it wasn't  here it comes there's the big ring the ring and i guess in her mind she was thinking the acropolis 
[00:15:00]  would be perfect of course it would on this amazing you know because before that i just took  you know vacations like any other any other dude it was disney and if you could like scrap off  enough money you go to the caribbean you go to the caribbean go to nassau but this was a biggie this  was like out of the norm so in her mind she probably was telling all her friends and family  i really did why would he take me to the acropolis it's stupid me we're walking away and it's in the 
[00:15:30]  distance and the tears are getting as we it was weird because as we got more distance between the  you know us and the acropolis the tears were really long and she's mumbling you son of a bitch under  our breath and i was like oh what god were we just in awful times oh what are you gonna do i was  never gonna like you know it was i was never gonna times it was the worst of times i was never  gonna pop the question because i just knew that something wasn't right but it's stupid me i stayed 
[00:16:00]  in there way too long pop the question you mind if another girl jumps in on this yeah that was  popping the question that could be a good topic for another day because we got a really busy show but  i bet you there's a lot of guys out there same thing like completely clueless that they were  they were supposed to i guess pop the question in this amazing romantic like to me it was just like  we were on a a field trip like wow look at this look at that i wasn't feeling like this romance thing 
[00:16:30]  but stupid me we're in a very romantic uh vacation yeah you know because of the you know the scenery  the setting is perfect perfect and i told you about the uh and and i think oh that was the last hope  she had because earlier on in that trip i told you i haven't said this in a while we went to  santorini which i i said the other day is the most beautiful place on earth and if you really do love  somebody wow take them there yeah take them there uh and we're uh at the you know the top in the town 
[00:17:00]  which overlooks the you know the water and stuff you gotta you know google image it to see how beautiful  it is i told you that explosive you know what when she thought i was gonna ask her there too  yeah it's like opie had this look on his face of love no no i was just ready to dump oh man did i  i destroyed uh not one but two bathrooms in santorini on the way back down to the ship  how romantic oh we were on two different paths man i was just enjoying uh you know the surroundings and 
[00:17:30]  she really thought that that was gonna be uh that was gonna be the you know the place robin in  detroit robin hi guys hi well first of all i have to sympathize with you because women are really just  not worth it but it amazes me that you guys put up with all this crap from women i don't understand  what they could be worth to put up with all this crap i think we were so involved with the radio show 
[00:18:00]  and i think it made the radio show you know much better because we were completely focused we didn't  have a distraction at home no no there was uh like the i can't tell you a one really romantic  moment i had in my entire uh marriage i i can't really conjure up a romantic moment it was it was  just a catastrophe there was nothing going on that was like wow i really want to do this or yeah you 
[00:18:30]  know it was just these these maybe moments of non-hostility and then moments of hostility  yeah and they were all you know i i definitely could have been like one of those battered husbands  just oh god but it was mostly just verbal kind of just flack that i got i told you the stories of how  we would go out and um you know we'd both tie one on get a few drinks in so we could tolerate each 
[00:19:00]  other's company and um i would have to say look uh i know we're going to be drinking tonight this was  the pre the pre going out speech the old pep talk i know we're going to be going out tonight we're  going to be doing some drinking but could you please remember this right now just remember right now  there's no problems going on so there's really nothing to argue about this was my speech there  there's no problems so when we're out having fun there won't be a problem right so no matter what 
[00:19:30]  you're thinking at any time realize that it's probably what we're drinking and and you know keep  that in mind just in the back of your mind no matter what happens we're fine right now right yeah  no no we're fine there's no problem okay fast forward uh a few drinks in well you son of a bitch 
[00:20:00]  wait oh but why what why remember earlier when i said there was no problem no problem and i can't  i wish i could come up with a reason why this confrontation happened but uh it happened i had no  idea why and it would always end like that and then in the morning everything's hunky dory like oh  hey how you doing oh good remember when i was a son of a bitch um remember that i just wow and i just 
[00:20:30]  stuck it out we talked about this too remember uh like all of a sudden you'd just be living your life  and all of a sudden it would just be in just just another day really yeah but your your chick would  start crying and you're like what the f is wrong today and then you realize it's some kind of  daddy's it's daddy's birthday or oh or something and you're like oh that's right i have to deal with 
[00:21:00]  this crap too at least yours is on a regular day what do you mean well my my happy day for her was on  christmas day every christmas for nine years you can't be happy like christmas dude i i was alone  for a bunch of christmases when i was doing radio and all these hell holes yeah and i was still happy  because it's christmas christmas day was the day uh baggage just came flying out at me uh apparently

[00:32:30]  yeah wouldn't you be bringing a lot of baggage to the the remarriage certainly would like you're  gonna just every reason you got divorced you're gonna forget all that stuff that you went through  no mark maron was saying when he was in here that he's talking to his ex and he's like eh  you kind of miss him after a while you know he was like i still have feelings you'd get nostalgic  is what it is it's nothing but nostalgia and you you think about all the good things you know when  we were at disney world at epcot and the fireworks were going off we were both looking up at him 
[00:33:00]  smiling and then you but and then you blamed me for forgetting where the car is  all right and uh that all forgets yeah you forget all that stuff you forget all that we fought in  traffic on the way home get the sweet could you yeah yeah the fireworks no it's like nostalgia for the  50s oh great there was segregation yeah yeah no sex guards being brought in because somebody wants to go  to school yeah there's a good old swing in time yeah it's a time of innocence the happy days 
[00:33:30]  dominic 63 would not comment on whether they are planning divorce again really uh leslie barbara  yes does she look familiar anthony she's 44 years old certainly does why anything you can say believe  she kind of looks exactly like the woman that uh was in the court a lot of times um when dominic  wasn't in there doing you know the representing i believe she was a co-worker uh yeah i think so 
[00:34:00]  yeah yeah yeah yeah i do remember yeah yeah yeah yeah not uh you know not no one associated with  dominic is really one of my favorite people any of my favorite people because um uh they put me  through um one of the worst times in my life one of the other one ultimate worst it has to be the  worst there probably isn't even a close second yeah all right if there's a worse time it's been  blocked out by childhood memory of course yeah we can't call richard to make sure this was the worst 
[00:34:30]  time of your life times uh leslie barbara 44 also a divorce lawyer okay he was arrested and charged  with second degree menacing after the incident monday that sounds like dominic had to call the cops to  help him out yeah oh it sounds like it he's a lawyer i wasn't there he knows the deal you're a  lawyer something happens you call the cops cops right away and get it she gets arrested it's on  record it helps out in the case or something oh great two divorce lawyers but the police involved in 
[00:35:00]  their marriage could anything be better you gotta love it she spent the night in jail oh what a shame  i could only hope oh could i only hope it was like the scene with linda blair in caged heat  put her in the laundry room some matronly woman with a broom handle oh it's good to know this guy's in  hell oh yeah i knew it that phony smiling face everywhere he goes has to be hiding misery misery 
[00:35:30]  uh-huh i was in uh atlantic city i'm at the borgata i'm trying to wolf down something to eat  before i hit the tables and his uh his gut comes into my peripheral vision and he's just i turn my  head and he goes hey how are you how you doing oh my god like big smile this is the guy that i  who sued you with your ex-wife i had to cut a check for and he thinks you're gonna go oh you know what 
[00:36:00]  so nice to see you and i was like and i'm just like you know i'm eating i'm eating hey how are  things going good ew yeah yeah just turning the screws on me oh and i'm like just just i don't  want to talk to you i don't want to see you my favorite part of that story though is wolfing  down food before just being angry that your bodily needs are in the way of your gambling  just get oh let me tell you protein in me so i can gamble please that's how it is and then 
[00:36:30]  that's like at eight o'clock maybe eight o'clock at night yeah and i'll be at the tables until  eight in the morning right where i'm cursing my bladder for not being bigger like i gotta go to  the bathroom i gotta i'll all right i'm gonna wait for my turn here you'll hold it that long  actually when you're gambling you won't pee no there has to be dudes who have catheters and coke  bottles in their boot i hate like when the when the when the button passes me yeah then then i'm 
[00:37:00]  like you know i'll go but if the button's like good it's taking a while to get around i'll sit  there and wait sure yeah i'll wait well she spent uh the night in jail uh dominic himself bailed her  out oh there you go holy crap this gets better and better you know we didn't want to read this  ahead of time we wanted to enjoy every line as as we read it for the first time for everybody today  dope so she hits him on the head with a plate there's a gash there's police she goes to jail  and then this dummy goes and bails her out he got stitches i don't know if he got stitches oh you 
[00:37:30]  know i i'm sure he's the type of guy that would listen very closely to us oh i'm sure fatso  and you are still fat even though when you you allegedly got your stomach stapled  you'll always be a fatso uh she spent the night in jail dominic himself bailed her out tuesday  morning uh but she was promptly arrested when wait but she was promptly re-arrested okay wow this  gets good but she was promptly uh re-arrested when police said she violated a restraining order by 
[00:38:00]  going back to the couple's glenn cove home you know what's hysterical he probably bailed her out  knowing that he had the restraining order yeah took her home didn't tell her here you go honey  all right go inside 9-1-1 she's back she's back that's probably exactly what happened oh yeah you  know it's brilliant if that is the case sure you might have to give him uh that one uh the usually 
[00:38:30]  flamboyant barbara said only i hope she gets the help she needs oh boy what he's kind of making  these suggestions that perhaps she needs help yeah and uh you know clearing him to look like the guy  that was hey yeah i'm a normal great guy and this woman perhaps needs some help and doesn't he need  help if he's held her out doesn't he need help if he was married five times to and and married twice to 
[00:39:00]  the same woman yeah that sounds like a guy that might need a little help whenever you suggest  someone needs whenever someone needs help it's never good it means that there's something they're  doing that's horrible all i recall is is her wheeling in that giant hand truck of files dude a hand truck  of files about my effing case jesus which by the way and i've said it on the air before  no kids we were married for you know just short of nine years i guess no kids didn't own a house 
[00:39:30]  we were renting um leased cars did it's just not not the proverbial pot to whiz in or the window to  throw it out of nothing and uh there was files like this was you know a hollywood uh uh divorce case  like the star report and i i went on the cheap and i had a lawyer who was just like he had one folder  he was like me in school you got a pencil and a piece of paper like that was my lawyer and i got 
[00:40:00]  ski rude wow and i i to this day i'm like i should have just gotten ralph felder and and just gone all  out did you pay for her lawyer too absolutely so she can pick any lawyer she wants and that seems to  be what women can do in in divorce cases they can get whatever high profile lawyer they want because  you'll be paying for it yeah you're paying the guy and then you gotta save money you over you gotta  save money by getting a bad one for yourself one on the cheap it just let me pay for a good lawyer 
[00:40:30]  for her and then i'll get the crappy one and this is how this is how the laws are uh are written in  this in this country well it's it's bizarre but it is good to see when uh something um some karma  comes back i guess i'll bet you half those files were empty i'll bet that's an intimidation thing  they do like there's probably enough about the case but there's probably half of them are probably  just paper yeah man you didn't filing things so it looks like oh my god they're gonna litigate 
[00:41:00]  forever i can't fight this you know something that's very good he makes a really good point because  who would be able to read all that stuff that is if you think about you didn't go through that box  no so that's a really effective that would be good because who would go through it and if it's old  legal documents no it's the same thing as kenneth star dropping uh dropping the papers for right  report on the steps of the house which nobody uses that entrance for anything yeah and with a 
[00:41:30]  whole van full of papers he just did it to be flamboyant sensationalism yeah by finishing up  i've never even thought of that so she's got a lawyer and the lawyer's saying that there was a  misunderstanding because uh uh she thought she had permission to have her car picked up from the  couple's home uh-huh so her car was back at dominic's uh and her i thought you said that you wanted the  spaghetti careened off your skull i'm sorry i misunderstood you said pastor shasta  the lawyer said that in his client's exhaustion after a night in jail yeah she misunderstood the 
[00:42:00]  court order and went to get the car herself police arrested her there wow would they put her out in  the friggin field like gans what kind of what kind of exhaustion do you get sitting in county  or whatever it is she was in just some lockup well ah we wish him nothing but the best right  oh please nothing but the nothing but continued success uh with uh your marriages marriages nothing 
[00:42:30]  but more miserable marriages for your future that's it i'm done with that marriage thing you're not  gonna get me again uh-uh-uh-uh all right we gotta take a break uh ruth's uh chris steakhouse you're  enjoying the omelet there lo i i'm enjoying i haven't been able to stop eating even during this break  it's part of my dna already the food's ridiculous we hawk in new jersey the roots uh uh chris uh  steakhouse i had some uh some extra steak on the side it was uh did you good right it was really i i 
[00:43:00]  would i would say it was delish it was very good hey uh we gotta take a break but uh chris is hard  to say let's go to ruth's chris it's an apostrophe a bunch of s's a foot sound how do you know how about  ruth chris's yeah where are you going i'm going to ruth's chris there's chris but this is ruth's  chris chris gotta sneak that out that's him ted's going to dinner yes yeah where are you going i'm  going to ruth's chris steakhouse i got a i got a text from steve this morning saying we're getting 
[00:43:30]  food from ruth's chris and i thought at five this morning i was like what a mess yeah oh they think  we're talking about we're not talking about it bad about your food it's just hard to say the name  we don't know how to say it yeah is there an apostrophe there or is it plural is it possessive  or plural for christ's sake where am i eating you're eating a ruth's chris for christ's sake  i can't say it i struggle and i get a little bit of drool on the right side i look like i'm 
[00:44:00]  antidepressant antidepressants  so they're cooking omelets up uh for everybody because it's roland's last day what what if there  was a spirit at that restaurant what would it be called oh you know something spooky  ruth's chris house  ghost you gotta listen for that that last ass there lo that's the bit ghost ghost 
[00:44:30]  ted is an ass why ted's just trying to say things right he was beaten as a child because  he said things wrong so he's trying to show off his smarts he should have been beaten  or ted i snuck it in there while we were in the middle of the bit but roland's leaving the show  oh that's it and we're not really happy about it it's roland we're in the middle of uh not in  the middle anymore but a huge merger has taken roland out of the equation merge and uh we fought  to keep him we did everything we could behind the scenes and to be quite honest with you no one 
[00:45:00]  listened to us was that there's nothing we could do they know better for our show i guess because  no one listened to us whatsoever he's gone many emails many phone calls many face-to-face meetings  and they just nodded a lot because that's what corporate douches he's gone opie and that's that  yes couldn't be helped couldn't be helped we love roland there's uh he's gone he's gone he's gone  we never what do you mean he's gone what do you mean he's you know there was nothing we could do  nothing anyone could do about it and uh he's gone he's gone and that's it what a great way to explain 
[00:45:30]  i've just shot your lifelong friend yeah in the back of the head in a room with chairs stacked  there was nothing anyone could do and he's gone he'll be helped he's gone he's gone he's gone  he's gone oh that oh you saw me oh you're dying it's like oh oh you got me on this one we thought  it was a big day but you murdered him oh the worst surprise party ever oh god oh no so and there's 
[00:46:00]  nothing anyone could do about it it's a very tough explanation to argue with but what he's gone  what do you mean he's in the bathroom of you yeah what do you mean you know you know he's gone you  know we're murderers this is what we do yes you know that thing that happens a lot because we're  criminals it just happened again this is just the shorthand of murderers hey you know he's gone  oh right now i get the premise of our lives that we kill each other you hold on weird little 
[00:46:30]  disagreements well i just beat up this phone with the uh receiver i love pesci's realization when he  walks in and just sees that oh no he can't even get no out what am i a yutz how did i fall for this  oh no oh no so we say goodbye to roland today it's a different movie yeah so that was the whole  crux that's what was going on in washington with the fcc was getting get rid of roland was the 
[00:47:00]  piece it was the big ra ra ra washington yeah washington mccain and we're gonna go to  washington bring a joe the plumber to washington washington enough with him oh god i don't like  or dislike him i just wish he was dead it's nothing and he's gone he means nothing oh god  his tan mock turtle that he wears all right we can talk about joe the plumber after the break  uh but roland's leaving that's why the food yeah we're disappointed we did everything we could for 
[00:47:30]  you roland we really did you know he brought guests to the show we never had that i didn't do  when we were doing the new thing we we got uh just amazing guests and it was all because of him he  understood the show and really worked it for us yeah so we go to break with uh something roland did  for us uh a while back him singing pavarati roland everyone right yes this is a big one yeah this is a  big one for roland he really knows this stuff roland you got to do pavarati proud today okay  i will all right here we go roland doing pavarati a little musical
