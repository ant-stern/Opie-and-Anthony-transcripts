<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about their controversial past as "shock jocks," revisiting infamous stunts like "Homeless Charlie," "Sex for Sam," the wiffle bat incident, "wee for a wee," and the "Boyer bus" prank.  They debated the definition of "shock jockery" and its perceived decline, criticizing the media's outdated understanding of the genre.  This segued into a mocking commentary on poorly executed April Fool's Day pranks by local news stations, highlighted by examples like false weather reports and fabricated retirement announcements.  Listener calls detailing their own April Fool's pranks were interspersed with the hosts' frustrated reactions to the board operator's repeated failure to play the "Friday, Friday" sound cue.  The missing Bronx Zoo cobra's social media presence and a viral video of a crying child upset about not becoming governor were briefly mentioned, along with a video of babies seemingly conversing.  Past guest Tracy Morganâ€™s appearance during the bee-in-a-jar stunt was also recalled.

The show then shifted to the high cost of living in New York City, contrasted with cheaper living elsewhere. This transitioned into a discussion about athletes' poor acting performances, using Don Drysdale as an example. A lottery story about a co-worker missing a $319 million jackpot by two dollars was recounted, with the non-participating co-workers dubbing themselves "The Five Survivors."  The conversation then focused on Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod), including rumors of his girlfriend pushing him into acting, allegations of him being a slumlord, and whether Yankee fans disliked him.  The pressures of immense wealth and maintaining a successful business were also discussed.  A significant portion focused on mocking John Sterling's Yankee home run calls, fueled by listener calls and tweets. This led to a discussion about the resurgence of unusual mustaches and a caller's mention of "Mustache March," a cancer awareness campaign.  Studio guest Jay Moore participated throughout this segment, engaging in banter with the hosts about his upcoming stand-up shows (Foxwoods and Borgata), an audition, a photo with Brock Lesnar, and a stiff neck.  His physical comedy and off-the-cuff remarks were prominent. Clips of sportscasters, including Earl Weaver, were played.

The next segment heavily featured Jay Moore discussing his Twitter experience, describing abusive comments and eventually quitting, giving his password to a friend. The conversation then moved to *Dancing with the Stars* guests Chris Jericho and Cheryl Burke, who shared anecdotes about the show's intense schedule and the personalities of various partners.  Burke mentioned some actors struggling with the training. Jericho provided humorous anecdotes about the show and wrestling, including a Lars Ulrich impression.  Negative comments about Wendy Williams's appearance were also mentioned.  Eddie Trunk then joined the conversation, sharing memories of wilder moments from his time with the hosts.

The following segment focused on Eddie Trunk's book, "Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal," particularly his song selections.  Discussions about "essential" versus popular tracks, notably for Van Halen ("Unchained," "Hot for Teacher"), and disagreements about various artists' inclusion (Guns N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Kiss, ACDC, Thin Lizzy, Rush) ensued.  Anecdotes from their time at a previous radio station, including a "Stalker Patty," chaotic management ("the lunatics were running the asylum"), a New Year's Eve broadcast from the roof, smoking weed in the stairwell, and accidentally viewing people showering, were shared.  Trunk plugged his upcoming book signings, and several songs were played.

The final segment continued the discussion of Eddie Trunk's playlist choices, punctuated by profane language and exaggerated reactions.  Jay Moore's severe neck pain led to a bathroom break, followed by a discussion of his health issues, including anxiety, panic attacks, unusual sperm issues, and an upcoming medical procedure. Opie's workout music preferences (Smashing Pumpkins and Jane's Addiction), the perceived gayness of dolphins, and the hosts' negative personalities were also discussed.  An earlier interview with Anthony and Jay Moore was mentioned but not aired.  The segment concluded with continued debate over Eddie Trunk's playlist choices.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few minutes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  7 a.m.  Waking up in the morning.  Oh, yeah?  Gotta be fresh. 
[00:01:30]  Gotta go downstairs.  Gotta have my bowl.  Gotta have cereal.  Seeing everything.  This is terrible.  Going kicking on and on.  Everybody's rushing.  Gotta get down to the bus stop.  Gotta catch my bus.  I see my friends.  My friends.  This is going great.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Gotta make my mind up.  Kicking in the front of the backseat.  I have no idea.  Hit it!  It's Friday, Friday, Friday.  Get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Friday, Friday.  Getting down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  For me, I enjoy Jesse Slaughter better.  Jesse Slaughter.  Who's Jesse Slaughter?  That's that crying.  Oh, yeah.  The crying girl.  The crying girl from yesterday.  That's right.  A lot more interesting to watch.  With the father.  As her father punches her in the face.  Holla!  It's April Fool's, huh?  Holla!  Yeah.  How many of these have we done?  Not many.  In our entire career? 
[00:02:30]  Not many.  Now they don't care, so they let us work on April Fool's.  Yeah.  I mean, whether it falls on a weekend or something else, or they don't let us work.  That was a phase for a time.  We haven't done many in the years that we've been doing the show.  Not many.  The champ.  Now, there was a time we got a free day off on April Fool's.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  Yeah, they were like, hey, just take the day off.  Just take the day.  All right.  It doesn't count as sick days or vacation days.  Just take the day.  I hear ya.  We don't want to deal with that crap.  No problem. 
[00:03:00]  But see, what they don't understand is we knew we were never going to be able to top ourselves.  Yeah.  We weren't going to bother again.  No.  And that's true.  It's like, what are we going to do?  Another dumb fucking radio April Fool gag?  Are we making the articles today?  I don't know.  Have you checked?  Have you checked our news thing?  Well, I know yesterday we made another shock jock column.  Did we make a shock jock column? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I forgot what it was called.  A shock jock.  We're shock jocks of all time or something.  Oh, God.  Boston.com had it.  How passe is shock jock?  And even Boston doesn't really talk about the April Fool's prank anymore because we did the church thing.  Yeah.  So when they talk about shock jocks, they can only give you one shocking thing each shock jock did.  One shocking jocking thing?  Yeah.  So they have to blow off the April Fool's Day prank where we said the mayor of Boston died and they just go with the church thing.  Yeah.  Whatever.  But we made the list yesterday. 
[00:04:00]  That's nice to know.  Thank you.  We made the list.  We're shock jocks.  We're officially in the shock jock hall of fame.  I don't think there's been anything shocking on radio.  Let me think.  When?  Even when we did the Homeless Charlie thing, that wasn't supposed to be shocking.  How shocking was that?  I don't think that was shocking.  I don't think it was either.  Howard hasn't done anything shocking in many years.  No shock jockery going on.  Imus.  What was the last shock jockery?  Was that shock jockery?  I don't think Imus was shock jockery. 
[00:04:30]  Seriously, when was the last shock jock thing?  I don't know.  I think it was.  You have to go with a mayor's prank like we did, the church stunt like we did.  Mancow had a few shock jock things, even though I hate that douche.  But he did when he stopped traffic on a bridge and stuff.  That's the type of thing we're talking about.  Ah.  That over-the-top stunt that was shocking.  Very good, Danny.  Wee for a wee?  Wee for a wee.  Remember?  They had the chick holding her piss until she died. 
[00:05:00]  I only say that because it was only up until that point where no one was really afraid  to do crazy things.  But now I think there's more fear involved at the upper levels that don't allow the shows  to do these things.  Well, the wee for a wee really shut down a lot of radio bits.  That shut down like everything.  I say that wasn't...  That was more misfortune.  Misfortune.  They didn't go into it with shock jockery in mind.  They went into it like this is a silly morning zoo type thing we're going to do.  Accidental shock jockery.  Yeah.  I'm talking about where, you know... 
[00:05:30]  Like manslaughter.  Where the radio...  That is like manslaughter of shock jockery.  I understand how it turned out.  You want premeditated shock jockery.  Yes.  Yeah, because sometimes things do happen.  Shock jockery in the first degree.  You could do that bit another hundred times, no one's going to die.  You know, it was unfortunate circumstances for that woman and everybody involved and it  sucks and it was a horrible thing.  But I'm talking about, you got to think old school Howard Stern, old school us.  Yeah.  You know, unfortunately, yeah, you got to put... 
[00:06:00]  Shocking.  You got to put man cow in that category.  So what was the last shocking thing we did?  I think Bubba had some shocking stuff in his career.  Yeah, he was doing shit.  The only reason I bring this up is because that stupid shock jock list.  It's on boston.com.  It bothered me because they're just so out of touch.  They don't understand that radio has moved way past this.  And guys like you and I and the rest of them, we're not shock jocks anymore.  Doing that anymore.  Yeah.  Did we come into work and try to figure out shocking things that got everyone talking?  Absolutely. 
[00:06:30]  It's like calling somebody that's doing a stage show a vaudevillian.  Right.  You know, it's done.  The last shocking thing I said, for us it was Homeless Charlie, but that wasn't supposed  to be shocking either.  That was, again, an accidental shock jockery.  What do you think?  Was it like the wiffle ball bat challenge?  No.  But that was shock jockery.  Nah.  Come on.  Taking a wiffle ball bat and up a girl's pussy?  Nah.  That's trying to be shocking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  What else would you say if that ain't it?  What else? 
[00:07:00]  That's a Tuesday.  Well, I know.  That was a Tuesday for us.  It was shock jockery.  We're getting, let me see, Slave Girl.  Remember Slave Girl?  But Patrice was in here.  Yes.  And we should be able to replay that.  Nigga versus Nazi.  When we try to see who could hail a cab first.  Patrice O'Neill or me dressed in Nazi regalia.  So we were just going for shocking?  Well, it doesn't mean, if your intent, your intent doesn't necessarily have to be like,  hey, let's do something shocking.  But your whole thing that you do on the show contains shock jockery. 
[00:07:30]  But the cab stunt was just funny and proven a point.  Yeah, but everything, I don't think we ever went into something going, let's do something shocking.  Like, it just turned out that way because that was the show we did.  See, Sex for Sam was shocking.  Even if it didn't end up in a church, that was, like, shocking.  Right.  And we knew it was shocking and we knew it would cause talk and we knew it could possibly  be picked up by the media.  Shooting a bottle rocket out of a woman's vagina?  That was just a fun day. 
[00:08:00]  That was just fun?  That was just fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  Why would it be ready?  What about the cell phone up the vagina?  Fun.  What about throwing eggs from a vagina into a blind man holding an Easter basket?  That was just amazing.  That anyone could do that.  That was just amazing.  Are those all shock jock stuff?  I think that's all shock jockery.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  I classify that as the shock jockery. 
[00:08:30]  What about the guys putting their dicks in jars and getting stung by bees?  Shock jockery.  Okay.  And that's more recent than the other stuff.  You think this place would allow us to release bees in the studio?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're going to be...  Hi, guys.  Yeah, we're dressing in bee suits so guys could stick their bare dick and balls into jars  with hornets in them.  And they don't...  Yeah?  Okay.  And this is the only thing I'll say today, I promise.  And that's why...  They just don't understand.  That's why we yell and scream because we know what we've done.  We did it. 
[00:09:00]  We know what we can still do and get away with it.  It was great.  That's why we'll never get along with the guys down the hall.  It was great.  They don't understand.  They don't get it.  They don't understand how great it is to get a bunch of bee suits for you guys.  I want Sons bee suits.  Sons.  What is it called?  Bee...  Bee...  Bee keepers.  Bee keepers outfits?  Yeah.  Outfit.  Bee keepers suit.  That was the last time we had Tracy Morgan on the show.  Tracy.  I didn't know he was scared of bees.  Tracy Morgan.  Boyer bused out.  See, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Boyer bus.  We went into the boyer bus thing knowing it was going to be shocking, knowing that the  press would probably pick it up, not knowing that people would get fired, to be honest  with you.  No, no.  I mean, not fired.  Arrested, which did happen on that.  No, I'm just trying...  When I was reading that yesterday, I was just trying to think.  And a lot of the examples they gave...  If you can go to BostonGuy.com, Danny, if you don't mind, most of the examples they give  for the radio guys doing shocking things, or...  It's not shocking? 
[00:10:00]  Well, they have Imus up there.  That was not supposed to be shocking.  What, the nappy...  Yeah.  That was a throwaway line that was supposed to get a couple laughs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That wasn't shock jockery.  They can't even get it right.  They got Laura Schlushinger as the number one shock jock, I guess.  Oh, when she was dropping in balls.  Yeah, yeah.  Number one?  Yeah, but she was just speaking her mind.  You know, I think...  They don't even get it right.  I think it was lame in general, but...  They don't even get it right.  It's just...  I'm begging the media to stop at the shock jock thing. 
[00:10:30]  I guess that's what I'm getting at today.  Over.  If you look at the internet, how shocking can we possibly be in an audio-based medium?  I don't think that's...  Yeah, but they're way behind.  The media will always be way behind.  They've always been way behind.  Especially local shit.  Local media, especially local media websites, way behind.  Way behind.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I really didn't...  I can't think of the last shocking thing we actually did.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  Baby diaper mustache? 
[00:11:00]  Nah, that was a goof.  That was just silly.  Yeah.  So, your criteria for shock jockery means we have to premeditate and think that it's going  to get pressed.  That's part of it?  Well, that's what shock jocks did, right?  To be shocking to get press.  But what if it's shocking, but something happens and the press thing falls through the cracks?  That's still shock jockery, even though no one picked up on it.  Yeah, I guess.  I guess you're right.  Like, I would even take into consideration you smashing the guy's cake. 
[00:11:30]  That was shocking?  As shock jockery.  I think it's not shocking.  That was just to make you guys laugh.  But it's considered shock jockery.  That was just to make you guys laugh.  Because you wouldn't have done it if we were just walking down the street and not on the  radio.  Let me think about that.  I know.  It kind of amazed me when I said it.  No, you know what?  That could be one of the criteria.  No, Ian knows me.  I certainly wouldn't do that unless there was some kind of attention with a microphone or 
[00:12:00]  a camera.  You're right.  Yeah.  I don't know the answer to that question.  I just know that the shock jock thing is long over.  It's over, Johnny.  I feel like the things we do, we're just trying to get a laugh and entertain the people.  Yeah.  That's always been it, too.  I don't come in here anymore and think that we're shocking anyone.  I don't think we ever really went into it going, let's shock people.  I don't think that was the first priority.  I think it was, let's have fun and make people enjoy the show and stuff. 
[00:12:30]  And that kind of stuff is what people enjoyed.  Who's the slow poke on the phones today?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What?  When's Troy going to wake up?  Troy Kwan?  I just need to know when Troy will be awake.  Troy Kwan Doe?  In here, all the lines are written out in full.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Then I, you know what?  Then I apologize to Troy Kwan.  Then we got a problem on our end.  Computer malfunction.  Yeah, nothing is written out over here.  So I don't know what.  Yeah, his whole screen is full.  I tried calling Mars.  I don't know where Mars is. 
[00:13:00]  Troy, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It looked like from my angle that none of the phones were answered yet.  Well, he should have fixed it back there.  Right.  Whatever.  People saying the baby bird.  Baby bird was shocking, but it was visual.  Like, I think the video.  Oh, the audio was great.  Yeah, but I think people could fill in the blanks and go, holy crap, this is horrific.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Eh.  Wow.  This is just in? 
[00:13:30]  What?  What happened?  Well, it seems Mayor Menino.  I'm kidding.  Jackals.  Ah, Jesus.  People are coming up with their own, ah, whatever.  Yeah.  Is anyone doing April Fool's things today, or is that a big thing?  Are other shows doing it?  I kind of want to know if people are still doing this.  I want to know what Nick Cannon's doing today for April Fool's.  Nick Cannon's got to be doing it April Fool's.  Because this guy is a terrific radio host. 
[00:14:00]  He's just amazing, setting the radio world on fire.  Is he going to put on an entertaining show, and then at the end go, April Fool's.  April Fool's.  I don't do this type of radio usually.  Back to the same dirt Monday.  I can tell you this much, the news is having fun with it, Ant.  Oh, boy.  The news is having fun with it.  Well, Obie, they know how to have fun.  They sure do.  You can't spell fun without news.  Did you say fun, fun, fun?  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  0 for 2.  Kicking in the front seat. 
[00:14:30]  0 for 2.  It doesn't matter now.  You missed a...  Erick goes, sorry, we're working on the phone.  Turn off the fucking music.  That's not your problem.  You've got to run the board and let other people work the phones.  Thank you.  It's fucking Friday.  Oh, is that it?  0 for 2.  0 for 2, motherfucker.  You would think after Friday's disaster, you would be ready to go.  Ready to go with the Friday thing.  What happened?  Here's the local news, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Well, I've got to tell you, they're all doing the same thing.  It's a news montage.  Oh, this is great.  The weather is no.  Anyone?  Anyone?  The weather is no.  Anyone?  Joke?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  April Fool's joke?  Ah!  Plus, it's April Fool's Day.  The weather is no joke.  And it's no April Fool's joke.  This morning, states to our east are dealing with up to a foot of snow.  People in the northeast today are getting more snow. 
[00:15:30]  It is not an April Fool's joke.  So, the first day of April, a little bit of April Fool's up there in the northeast, Veronica.  Oh, God.  Why?  Wow.  That is really fucking...  Aren't they terrific?  They're just terrific.  They know how to bring the funny.  They sure know how to tie everything together.  Oh, yeah.  Got a special day like April Fool's.  There's no April Fool's joke here. 
[00:16:00]  Good for them.  They're having some fun with it.  They're having fun.  Fun, fun, fun.  Seriously, you rock.  That's 0 for 3.  Swing in a miss.  You're kidding, right?  Can I go to the left-hander today?  Who could run the board today?  Oh, boy.  You know who's got nothing to do today?  Who would probably love to run that goddamn board?  Derek.  Derek.  Derek's got nothing to do.  His computer's fucked up.  He can't do some problems.  He could be behind the board today?  He could be part of the show?  You rock.  What was that excuse there? 
[00:16:30]  Because now you're 0 for 3.  That was no excuse.  That was me just looking for something else.  I wasn't paying attention.  I have to stress how easy that job is.  I would kill for that job.  I would do another...  If I had that job, I would do another 20 years of radio.  No problem.  I would just sit there like a zombie.  You listen to the show.  All you have to do is listen for the cues.  You hear what they're talking about,  and then you press a little button.  We all know we're doing the Friday thing again today  because it worked kind of good last week.  So you have it readily available.  We want to squeeze another Friday thing out.  He's 0 for 3. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Damn.  We're going to bring in the left-hander.  Yeah.  Useless.  Let's go.  And then he gets mad at me and everybody else.  You do it to yourself, E-Rock.  Oh, look.  The fucking golf cart's coming out with the big hat on it.  Oh, wait.  Let's get Enter Sandman to come in.  Yeah.  Let's get the big closer.  Ah, the big closer.  We're bringing in the closer after the fucking 15 minutes into the first inning.  Well, you see that.  I mean, baseball season's here.  Every once in a while, you get that shell shocking in the first inning. 
[00:17:30]  You get the guy that just gave up too many runs.  It's like, fuck, he gave up eight runs.  I know.  We got to get him out of there.  You got to pull him out.  He's going to get mad in the dugout,  but the other guy's got to pat him on the back and just, you know.  See, that's why I can't be the manager.  I would keep the guy in because I think the fans would enjoy it.  Just watching him self-destruct completely?  Yes.  So why are you keeping E-Rock in?  No, let's keep him in.  The easiest cue in radio.  When we say fun, you hit the fucking thing,  and then we do a little something.  0 for 4, by the way.  That would have been very... 
[00:18:00]  See, that would have been funny if, as you're explaining it,  you said the word and he popped it on as a goof.  It would have been very...  But that takes thinking.  God.  Yeah.  He's so flustered right now as to what to do.  It doesn't matter anymore.  You ruined the bit.  You just ruined it.  The bit's ruined.  You ruined it.  Anthony, news is really having a lot of fun with this April Fool's thing.  No way.  Oh, yeah, man.  We go around the country today.  Around the country? 
[00:18:30]  Not just in our area?  Hey, we did the montage locally.  Of course we did.  They're all doing an April Fool's weather thing.  Yeah.  Even though the snow, they got the Huddy guy up north,  and he's trying to make something out of the snow that they're getting up north.  It's flurries behind him, and it's not a flake has hit the ground and stayed there.  No.  And he's still reporting from there.  Wouldn't you as the news director go,  Hey, Huddy, come back to the studio.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Come back.  Go to the Bronx Zoo and see if you can do one last story on the missing cobra, 
[00:19:00]  even though they found it.  When the reporter gets out of range of the signal so people can even watch the channel,  it's time to turn around.  It certainly is.  They're watching news from Buffalo.  It certainly is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fox 95 in Indianapolis reads a hilarious story from a viewer.  Hilarious.  So now that means...  They're all doing April Fool's.  Very funny.  It is Friday.  Very good to see you.  This morning we're at...  Wait, they could do Friday, but we can't do Friday? 
[00:19:30]  I thought that was E-Rock finally.  That was me.  Oh, shit.  I thought they were playing it and talking over it.  He said it, so I hit it, and then you hit it at the same time.  So, 0 for 5.  This is such a clusterfuck.  It's the easiest bit, though.  Were you ready for the Friday thing today?  Or you forgot?  No, I had it here in the car.  You forgot, though, right?  Yeah.  It is Friday. 
[00:20:00]  Very good to see you.  This morning we're asking some of the best pranks you've ever pulled or been a victim of.  I think we've all got some stories to tell.  We got this one from Lindsay last night who says,  I just woke up my son and told him he was late for school.  Ever been in that situation before?  He rushed around his room and got ready.  Then when he came down to the living room for breakfast, we yelled, April Fool's.  She said she loved it.  That's a riot.  That's a riot, wow. 
[00:20:30]  Really?  Why is that a riot?  It's a riot because it was an April Fool's joke.  It completely lacked riot-ness.  That was lack of rioting.  They've got to keep it safe, though, you know?  These April Fool's jokes have got to be safe.  Keep it safe.  NBC plays a great trick on the audience.  You ready for this one?  Please.  While New York's missing cobra has been found, its digital identity is still a mystery. 
[00:21:00]  As the city searched for the missing reptile and nearly 200,000 Twitter users were captivated  by a tweeting Egyptian cobra out on the town.  But now that thousands on Facebook are clamoring for the cobra to host Saturday Night Live,  we have to reveal that the snake's true alter ego actually is our very own Bill Cairns.  And I'm upset with you, Bill, because you've never told me that you were on Twitter.  Yeah, see, that would be assuming that, A, I could Twitter, B, do Facebook, 
[00:21:30]  and C, know what a snake would do in about a week off.  April Fool's.  Thanks, Bill.  Oh, my God.  Did that just happen?  It's so uncomfortable.  Is...  I think when you do an April Fool's prank,  you can't say April Fool's right after you set up the prank.  No, it's got to be like...  You've got to give it some time to sink in. 
[00:22:00]  Even though that one wasn't believable on any level.  No, no, that just stunk.  All right, well, then you go, we go to CBS 9.  CBS!  In Washington, D.C.  Uh-huh.  These guys really, they pulled a wall right over your eyes, Anthony.  Oh, they're great.  This is terrific.  News winners of that 319 Mega Millions jackpot, they've gone public.  And find out how much they will walk away with after Uncle Sam gets his cut.  And before we take a break, I'd like to announce that Mike and I, 
[00:22:30]  this is our last morning newscast, because we're part of the group that won the Mega Millions.  April Fool's.  Yeah.  Sorry.  No.  Absolutely forget.  This is the one day you can pull a prank on a co-worker.  You don't have to worry about them waiting for you in the parking lot.  No.  You know what?  I think we've got to come out of retirement, I'm starting to think.  These people don't know how to do it.  No.  They said, this is our last day.  April Fool's.  April Fool's.  This is our last April Fool's.  April Fool's.  They don't know how to do it. 
[00:23:00]  First of all, when you do an April Fool's prank like that, people would have to give a fuck.  I bet you people are just watching TV like, whatever, how's my traffic today?  I don't give a fuck if this is your last day.  I never cared about you two stupid people that were put together just for the local news.  I don't care that there's an Asian and a black and a white person doing my news.  Do you think anybody went for a split second?  Oh, no.  I would bet.  I wake up with these people.  I would bet not a one.  Not a one.  Not a one. 
[00:23:30]  And then they were scared that maybe somebody in management was going to say, thank God.  Now we don't have to fire them.  Yeah, the paperwork's already been in place.  Before they could get it, they're just being handed pink slips.  But they don't even have a pause in there before they announce April Fool's.  That's stunk.  Just going around the country.  And I hope we have more of these as the morning goes on.  Yeah.  CBS 9 in Baltimore, which I guess is different than CBS 9 in Washington, says their weatherman is, okay, this one has potential. 
[00:24:00]  Is gay?  This one has potential.  So I don't want to give it away.  This one has potential.  Okay.  I have not heard this.  All right.  Let's give it a listen.  So if it turns out to be horrifically douchey, I apologize.  But it has potential.  I'll give them that much.  All right.  Welcome back to 9 News Now.  I'm Andrea Rohn.  Hey, I'm Mike Heineck.  Thank you for joining us.  Happy Friday.  Good morning, Angie Goff.  I'm so sad.  You're sad.  That Howard Bernstein's not with us anymore. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  April Fool's.  Holy shit.  They can't spit it out.  It's sad.  That April Fool's.  That's not how you do it.  No.  If they did it any other way, they would offend people.  Right.  Then don't do it.  And you can't do that.  That is absolutely why they have to do it.  My point is, then don't fucking do it.  Then just don't do it.  Because if you say he's no longer with us, which, by the way, they were suggesting that 
[00:25:00]  he's dead.  Yeah, that's what it sounded like.  They were suggesting.  No longer with us.  He was dead.  You let that sit there for a segment.  No.  There wasn't even a second that went by between announcing that he's no longer with us.  No longer with us.  April Fool's.  No longer April Fool's.  Let's go back.  But then I think there's a little more after that.  You're sad.  That Howard Bernstein's not with us anymore.  Oh.  April Fool's. 
[00:25:30]  He's freaking out right now.  I know.  He's going to be calling me right now.  I know.  He's already called Annie early this morning to talk about what he saw outside his window.  Yeah.  He saw the rain turning to some light snow this morning.  Wow.  Wow.  I try to put myself in this group of people when I hear this type of thing.  Yeah.  I go, I would never hang out with these people.  What dullards?  Listen to them.  Because this is what they find funny.  Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend. 
[00:26:00]  That was funny.  You take that one, Ant.  See, that was funny.  Funny's different than fun, you idiot.  It's like, because that was funny.  Not like, that sounded like they're having fun.  So any word that starts with F-U-N, you're going to hit that.  Can I defend Eric real quick?  How can you defend him?  Funny and fun are different things.  What if he was just so super cat-like with his reflexes, he heard, oh.  And he was on it.  He was fucking on it. 
[00:26:30]  I don't think so.  Let's try this.  Fun do.  See, it doesn't work.  How about, hey, fungus?  But being really quick like that on the board, I mean, that's one of the fundamentals of radio.  Oh, just kidding.  It's April Fool's.  April Fool's, April Fool's, everybody.  April Fool's.  I'm the funniest person in the newsroom.  He's just shell-shocked now. 
[00:27:00]  He really is.  He's rattling off shots at anything that moves.  But just the laughs.  Like, oh, we're just kidding.  Isn't this fun?  We're funny people.  I've got to be honest with you.  I've been in the news person circle, Opie.  As you know, I was in a romantic liaison with a news person.  And I have gone out with these people to various bars and parties and things like that.  And they do, as they say, let their hair down when they're out and about. 
[00:27:30]  There is a different, it is not the, oh, gosh, golly, let's not offend.  They are some of the most rank, politically incorrect drunkards I have ever hung out with.  And they know how to have some fun.  Yes.  Ah.  All right, so you're giving us some fine insight.  Yeah, a little bit.  So then you're saying the personality that they portray on local TV is so different. 
[00:28:00]  It's a complete act.  Like, when you hear me and Ant, I'm sure this is a hyper version of our personalities.  Yeah.  You know, how could it not be?  But in general, we're these people.  This is us.  Okay?  They are so far from what they really are.  Yeah.  That confuses me.  Why wouldn't they take some of that, some of what you see in a bar, let's say, and bring it to the TV?  Just a little.  I understand it's a little different.  Yeah, they know they can't because that's not what the bosses want.  It's a very strict regimen when they're in that studio doing the news. 
[00:28:30]  They can't be doing racist jokes and all that, but something a little different than what we just heard with the, ah, just kidding.  April Fulham, because you know they're like, ugh.  I've seen them actually literally go like, ugh.  After they've done something?  Yeah.  They go to commercial break and they've done something.  It's like just, ugh, God, I wish I could say something else or something.  I just think there's a market for someone being a little more real on local news.  Yeah.  Hell yeah, I'd love to see it.  You can't just put us on local news and say, all right, do your thing, but still. 
[00:29:00]  Still, but these guys, it's...  Although it would be good.  I watch, uh, you ever see the Onion News Network?  Yeah, of course.  That's fucking funny.  Hilarious.  And they are doing like that kind of thing, where it looks like the news, I mean, they  got that hot chick that looks like, it looks like a CNN type of thing, and they're just  dropping the F-bomb and fucking having fun.  You think there's a market to have that on every day?  Uh, yeah.  You do, right?  The Daily Show kind of does it, you know?  True.  They do it.  I think they used to be a lot more news spoof oriented than they are now. 
[00:29:30]  It's more now like...  They're starting to be doing a talk show with the news involved.  Yeah.  With just jokes.  Yeah, yeah.  With some jokes in the news.  He's not much different than anyone you see on...  Well, obviously he leans differently than Fox, but he's no...  He's not much different than those guys on MSNBC and CNN and Fox.  He's just the other end of a Glenn Beck or something.  He just makes it funnier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To his, you know, people, people that like his angle on it, because there are a bunch 
[00:30:00]  of people, you mention Glenn Beck and say he's nuts or anything like that, and they  jump on you like it's crazy.  They find him very entertaining.  They love his chalkboards and things like that.  And then people like Jon Stewart because of his politics and what he's got to say.  Then he's got guests on, big guests, you know?  Right, right.  Shit like that.  But that started out as being kind of a goof news show, and then the Colbert Report is  kind of a goof on those Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity type shows.  Yeah, so there's definitely a market for that.  I think, though, like a pure news show where you do take the actual stories, not like the 
[00:30:30]  Onion where they make up the stories.  Right, right.  You take the actual news stories and talk about them in a way that, like, real people  just bullshit about things would be great.  I think there's a market for it, certainly.  I think so, too.  I think they did a poll and said a lot of, especially, a lot of younger, a lot of younger  demos actually do get their news from Jon Stewart.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hell yeah.  That's kind of crazy.  If you think about it.  Just because of how it started, like you just explained.  And you know what the deal is?  It's easier to break down that way. 
[00:31:00]  Like, it's just easier.  It's more entertaining, so you kind of absorb it more.  And it's just, they're not spending the entire day trying to come up with new angles on it  and shit.  Like, you watch CNN or Fox News all day when a big story's breaking, and your fucking head  is spinning after the first 15 minutes.  It's just like, what is that?  I've listened to 20 pundits that I don't even know what the fuck they're talking about.  It's 99% speculation and opinion.  And then you can't get the real news.  They're coming in saying, well, this hasn't been confirmed yet. 
[00:31:30]  So you're like, well, I don't even know what's happening.  More importantly, where's Anderson Cooper?  Is he back home?  Is he okay?  Is Anderson okay?  Have we seen him?  Where is he?  What country is he in?  Is he back in the good old U.S. of A.?  I hope so, because that radiation's running amok over there at those nuclear reactors.  That's taken care of.  I watch the news.  I haven't seen a story in many days.  You haven't seen a story?  Is it over?  It's done?  It's over, yeah.  They're back to normal.  That's fine.  All those people have homes.  Oh, God bless them.  And they have certainly moved on.  You know, you're right. 
[00:32:00]  I haven't seen many pictures or video or anything like that from Japan, so I guess everything's  fine.  Oh, good.  They got rid of that problem.  Yeah, certainly.  They've moved on to other things.  Move on.  DJ on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, guys.  97.5 W.A.L.K. here on Long Island.  Yeah.  Take a call on, everybody.  Oh, don't forget.  We have a big announcement in the morning.  All they're playing is Christmas music.  We've changed our format.  365 days, 24 hours a day.  Christmas music.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, but you're the one listening to 97.5 W.A.L.K.  Okay.  Yeah, did they get you?  Did they get you, dude?  Keep laughing, stupid.  I like this guy.  That's funny.  I like the guy.  That's fucking funny because why would they be playing Christmas music all year long?  It's a great gag, I would say.  I've been in those meetings many times over the years.  They go into a conference room and go, one guy stands up all proud, like, this is what 
[00:33:00]  we're going to do.  Here's what we're doing this year, guys.  This is what, wait till you hear this.  And then everyone in the room, because they're too scared that they might get fired, they all  have to fake go, oh, that's awesome.  They have to smile.  And then when he says everything, you go, oh, that's great.  And then there's applause.  It's like, okay, we're going to start with a douchebag and shithead in the morning show.  So they're going to go on and make the announcement.  Let's get Johnny to do some production.  Yeah, yeah.  Could you do some production, Johnny? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, I think I could do something.  Production guy.  Then some douche in a tie.  Can we sell it?  Maybe we could sell it.  Can we sell this?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Everything has to be sold now in radio.  Yes, sell it.  Let's see.  Oh, God, do I hate radio.  Oh, it's stupid.  Oh, Obama's going to be impeached today?  That sucks.  Ah, who announced that?  I don't know.  Damn. 
[00:34:00]  It's, oh, this is crazy.  This guy's on it.  Hey, Craig.  Aaron in Kansas.  Go ahead, sir.  Aaron.  Hey, guys, what's up?  You will not believe what kind of April Fool's joke I just did.  What'd you do?  I just told the McDonald's drive-thru, hold on, that their light bulb was burned out in  the menu board.  Oh, God.  Did they send someone out?  Oh, my God, did they?  They're crazily going nuts.  Oh, my God, did they?  A big event. 
[00:34:30]  Rob Moon!  We're hiring Down Syndrome people at Walmart.  All right.  Jesus, Aaron.  Oh, fuck, man.  That's a good gag, by the way.  But you know what?  You've got to say, I think he did it wrong.  He went too far, and he was hurtful.  He probably should have said, you know, like,  Hey, I'm at your drive-thru, and I noticed I might help you out here.  The light bulb for your menu board's burnt out.  Hey, Brussels!  Hey, Brussels!  Don't send anyone out! 
[00:35:00]  Don't call the cops.  I'm just trying to have fun.  Oh, God, I hate this industry.  April Fool's.  How'd this dumb day get started, anyway?  It really is stupid.  Changing topics.  I want to know why Howard Stern's working today.  Yeah, April Fool's!  Oh, my God, I don't want to be fired for talking about him.  Oh, fuck, meeting.  Now there's a meeting.  Thanks.  Could I need a nap, anyway? 
[00:35:30]  All right, where are we going?  Wow.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I guess they found the snake.  The stupid snake would never really...  April Fool?  No.  Are you just letting this one linger?  Although Andy Levy...  Nah, nah.  Andy Levy, brilliant once again on Twitter.  He's already very suspicious, saying the fucking Bronx Zoo decided to bring in another Cobra  just to calm everyone the fuck down.  Oh, man.  Knowing that they're never going to find the actual Cobra, but the news isn't on this one. 
[00:36:00]  They could do that.  And I kind of like this theory.  I don't think Andy was...  I think Andy was being part funny, but part serious.  Like, why wouldn't they just, like, bring in another Cobra and say, no, we found it?  We found it.  Well, I listened to the news story, and something that struck me, they said they're going to  make sure the snake is okay, and then put him back in the enclosure.  And now, think of the publicity.  Of course.  People are going to want to see this snake. 
[00:36:30]  Now, even if it's not the same fucking snake, if they found that snake dead, they would have  to go like, dude, let's just get another snake, because this is a goldmine for us.  Yeah, of course.  So they said they found it curled up in a dark corner of a non-public area.  Yeah, they found it in a perfect...  Which is very convenient.  Yeah, they found it in a perfect place where it had no chance of hurting anybody.  Right.  No chance of hurting anybody.  I think Andy Levy might be on to something.  Yep, yep.  But no one's talking about that.  The dope!  Ha ha ha!  Oh, April Fool's. 
[00:37:00]  They're just going with it, like, oh, they found the snake.  You know, of course, the Cobra, that's not even that impressive.  They made it look way more impressive on TV.  It's measured in inches, it's not even like...  20 inches, I think you said?  Yeah, it's not a big thing.  It is venomous.  It is venomous.  Sure.  Watch out.  Sure.  But that was a big story this week, the fucking missing Cobra from the Bronx.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have a missing Cobra.  Ha ha ha!  My car!  See, get it?  Oh, yeah.  I thought there was an April Fool's in there somewhere.  I have a super snake. 
[00:37:30]  I'm getting it back soon.  April Fool's?  No, April Fool's is really getting it back soon.  Unless the garage is like, April Fool's!  Ha ha!  We told you that two weeks ago.  Is that part April Fool's?  Uh, no, this is, uh, fucking April truth.  This is April unfortunateness.  Ha ha ha!  Well, Jim Cossack, I think I'm starting to like this guy.  He's the weather guy that just gets wacky and starts yelling and screaming.  Crazy weather guy.  We played his audio a few times on the show.  He's lovable.  This fucking thing is, um, definitely going a bit viral. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  He, uh, I don't know.  We could just play it.  Snakey, snakey.  Snakey, snakey.  Snakey.  I got something for you!  I got to pound you with two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen as we stroll on in through  the nighttime hours.  And then I got to drop the snow hammer upon you, upon that scaly little tailpipe of yours. 
[00:38:30]  So then what are you going to do?  Well, let me tell you what you're going to do.  You're going to find the ground-up pig schnauts, horses' tails, at Yankee Stadium tomorrow at  1.05 for first pitch with the Tigers.  They're called stadium dogs, and oh, they're oh so delicioso.  Get the ketchup, rellis, and mustard while you're at it, too. 
[00:39:00]  Then I will pound you again!  With more of the snowfall.  And if, if, for some reason, they haven't caught your scaly tail yet, I'm going to get  you soaking wet again earlier next week.  So what do you say to that?  Snakey, snakey.  Oh, God.  Snakey, snakey.  I hate this guy.  He's a cobra? 
[00:39:30]  Eh.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  That is, that is so infuriating to listen to.  That's why I like it.  What an asshole.  What was, uh, I was looking up on TV, it said, I just want to be governor, and then it had  a kid crying.  Oh, yeah, that's going everywhere.  Is that a sensation now?  Oh, yeah.  I just saw that on, uh.  I didn't see the video, but I know the story.  Some little kid is really bummed he can't be governor.  Why?  I'm losing his mind. 
[00:40:00]  He's crying like crazy.  I gotta see this.  Yeah, can we get the audio?  I love crying children.  Yeah, it's everywhere today.  I don't know how good the audio is.  I did hear the story, though.  There, there, there is, uh, this picture.  YouTube.  It's on the YouTube, as they say.  The YouTube.  Do we got to do a little, uh, ah, yeah, YouTube is crazy today.  They went back 100 years.  Oh, they did?  For April Fool's.  Well, it's nutty.  Uh, Jesse wants to be the governor of New Jersey.  Doesn't understand why he can't be, and he loses his shit.  Why are you crying? 
[00:40:30]  Because I want to be the governor, and I care.  Why can't you be the governor?  Because you're the governor.  Who's the governor of California?  Who?  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Who?  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Who?  What's his name?  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  How does he talk, Brandon? 
[00:41:00]  Where's your daddy and what does he do?  Where's your daddy and what does he do?  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  And how about you, Jesse?  You still sad?  Yeah.  What's making you so sad?  Because everyone tells me that I'm too small to be the governor of New Jersey.  You don't have to be so sad.  Maybe when you get bigger and older.  But then what about when you go to college? 
[00:41:30]  No!  I'm already in college!  What college?  I'm already in college!  You already have the education to be the governor?  Yes!  Would you raise property taxes?  Probably not wrong.  But then people wouldn't be happy.  You have to say, I'm going to lower them.  That's it?  And then you end your video?  And then you just stop it there?  The kid's crying.  It's great.  I want to be governor of New Jersey!  Why was the other kid wearing a fucking hockey helmet? 
[00:42:00]  I don't know what's going on there.  No, it's probably the overprotection of kids.  A little safety thing going on there?  Yeah, more safety.  How bad do you want this kid to be governor?  Why wouldn't you just throw him in there?  Why not?  Well, you know he's going to end up on the talk show circuit.  But why not?  Just give him the job.  Give him the job.  See if he can do a good job.  Can he do any worse?  I am going to waste taxes!  I mean, lower them! 
[00:42:30]  That's pretty good.  That's adorable.  You know, next to kittens on the internet, Crying Children has to be my favorite.  Kittens are terrific.  You saw the video, it was viral yesterday, the two babies having a conversation?  No.  You haven't seen that video yet?  No!  Have you seen it, Danny?  Danny's seen everything in the world.  Well, I saw everybody talking about it.  Yeah.  Usually once it hits the news, it's over.  I saw it on TV and I was like, eh, fuck it.  And they're just talking like in baby talk. 
[00:43:00]  They're having a conversation.  Yeah.  But you can tell they're really having some kind of alien language conversation.  Wow, now it's on over there.  That video, forget it.  That's going to be everywhere.  The little governor.  Jesse wants to be in New Jersey.  Yeah.  Guaranteed he meets Chris Christie.  Oh yeah, of course.  And Chris Christie will make him like sit at the governor's desk.  This might be an Obama thing.  Why?  He might go all the way to the White House with this.  All the way.  He's got as much experience.  He might.  There you go.  I said something nice for that.  This is a Letterman kid.  He'll be on Letterman. 
[00:43:30]  Oh yeah.  And then you move him up to the, yeah, he'll definitely meet Christie.  Yeah, he'll meet Christie.  He'll get to sit at the governor's desk.  And maybe even they'll let him like, like do something like with a piece of paper.  Like he'll sign his name all dumb kid like.  If they do that, I'm going to pee.  He'll sign a bill for something.  I'm not, this is just weird.  Is it?  You got two kids that look about a little over a year each.  Yeah.  Maybe.  And it's just weird.  They're in their minds.  They're having a conversation.  They're talking.  Yeah.  Hit that. 
[00:44:00]  Oh my God.  This, by the way, is the cure for all diseases, he's saying.  But we just can't translate it.  But they're too young.  Yeah.  And then once they get older, they lose that part of the brain that contained all this information. 
[00:44:30]  Right there was interstellar travel.  I kind of like your angle on this.  Why are we just watching the view clips?  Exactly.  They are saying shit to each other.  Like he goes up at the end.  Like he's asking him.  And then the kid goes, no, no.  He's waving his hand like, no.  No, that isn't how we should use ion propulsion.  You're crazy, kid. 
[00:45:00]  I'm glad you have an angle on this.  I got it down.  Oh, it's fucking brilliant language.  They're amazing.  God damn.  Just cracking each other up.  It goes on and on.  I like how the kid, like he blows off the other kid.  He's just like, no.  No.  I'm not agreeing with your point on this.  And it has a half million views already.  Just like that.  Jesus Christ.  The universe is like the river of piss going down my leg right now. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, you little fuckers.  That's adorable.  There you go.  Our Friday has begun, Anthony.  Yes, it has.  Oh.  Oh.  We'll go to break with this.  Yeah.  Stay tuned to the Opie and Anthony show.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  All good.  Nice.  David Lee Roth left Van Halen 26 years ago today.  Really?  Then he came back.  Better than ever.  Did you watch your Yankees yesterday?  Yeah.  I wasn't able to catch the whole game. 
[00:46:30]  I was very busy.  I'm busy with my packing and whatnot.  So I wasn't able to catch the whole thing.  But caught some of the good parts.  Some of the home runs.  Yeah.  Oh, we'll have those calls in seven minutes.  So you're going to commit to 162 games?  It is a tough journey.  It's a long fucking journey, right?  It's like a job.  It is like a job.  The only sport that's not a journey is that football. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Get 16 games.  Man, it's quick.  It's tough.  Once a week.  Even hockey, which I love.  I mean, my team's been out of it.  Even though we kicked the shit out of the Rangers last night and beat the shit out of Avery.  It was a fine win for the Islanders, but it doesn't mean anything.  A fine win.  It just made it harder for the Rangers to make the playoffs, which I guess we could take a little solace in that.  I don't know.  Some solace.  But even that, I was just talking to an Uber Islander fan that works around here.  And every time he sees me, because I like the Islanders, we have to talk about the Islanders. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, how about those Islanders?  Oh, really?  That's exactly.  It's exactly.  You know the guy, too.  And he's a nice guy.  He's probably listening to this, and I apologize.  That's uncomfortable.  Maybe it's time to stop talking about the Islanders for a little while, please.  Oh, that's a little uncomfortable.  I got a son.  Let's talk about that or whatever.  It's snowing out.  We can talk about the snow a little bit.  The weather.  How about April Fool?  But he's one of those guys, every time he sees me, we have to talk Islanders, and he was  all excited.  Like, yeah, big weather.  I'm like, our team's been out of it for weeks.  We don't even have a shot at the playoffs.  It doesn't matter at that point. 
[00:48:00]  And then it's like, yeah, but we got a good young team.  I'm like, yeah, but now we have to start all over.  Got to wait.  We have to wait to even start over.  Yep.  And then what?  Hockey starts up in October, and then it's 82 games from there.  Yeah.  And then as I'm walking back, I'm thinking, I got to ask Ann about baseball.  Are you ready to commit to 162 games now?  It is rough in the beginning to really just start, like, paying attention to every single  game.  It's exciting for the first week, because I guess it's back, but then what happens? 
[00:48:30]  Then you just fall into this malaise.  Is it?  No, you just kind of, yeah.  You miss a few games, but you know the results.  Like, even if I miss a game, I know what happened within minutes of the game ending.  I can't wait to hear.  This series in particular is very important.  Very important.  They'll say that about 20 games in.  This is a very important series.  And you say, no, it's not.  They still got 140 games to go.  Yeah, like 20 games in, you're thinking.  But they try to make it more than what it is.  And people try to talk about the team like, I don't know, it ain't looking good. 
[00:49:00]  It's like, come on.  Come on.  You've seen teams that have been shit the first half of the season go on to just kill  everybody and vice-y-versy.  I was listening to Mike.  Yeah, Mike on the treadmill the other day or the elliptical, whatever the fuck I use.  And he's like, you know, the Mets, because I'm sort of a Mets fan.  Not really.  Less and less as the years go by.  You should have bought in to the team.  Yeah.  Should have given them 200 million.  And he's like, look, man, the first 50 games. 
[00:49:30]  He's like, the first 50 games.  Yeah.  There's going to be hope for that organization.  So they've got to hope that they do pretty well with the first 50 games.  So there's going to be no one at that ballpark.  I'm just thinking it's nonsense.  Yeah, that's rough.  I guess if you're in that profession, you do sports talk, you've got to figure some shit out.  You've got to get an angle.  You've got to get an angle right out of the box, right?  I've got a slight angle.  I saw this in the paper when we were getting ready today.  A-Rod.  A-Rod. 
[00:50:00]  A-Rod is the highest paid player in the league.  We know that.  For the 11th year in a row, by the way.  I did not know that.  Holy mackerel.  I didn't know he's been the highest paid player for 11 straight years.  How does he pull that off and not perform in the clutch?  In the playoffs, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  But do you know the Royals are barely making more than Alex Rodriguez this year?  The entire team.  Yes.  That's the problem.  That's the problem with baseball.  The Yankees are a bought team. 
[00:50:30]  They buy the...  All right.  I saw this today.  The salaries for Kansas City's 27 players on its opening day roster and disabled lists  totaled $36.1 million, according to an analyst.  A-Rod alone will make $32 million.  Yeah.  Isn't that unbelievable?  You know what, though?  I love when people bitch about that.  I'm not even bitching.  I just think it's an amazing fact.  That's all.  I love when people bitch about that because here's another side of that.  When I go to Kansas City, I'm not paying $500 for a hotel room, okay? 
[00:51:00]  So it all equals out, doesn't it?  It all comes out in the worst.  In the worst.  I go to a restaurant in Kansas City.  That bill is not going to be the same bill I'm getting when I dine in New York City.  So it's all relative.  Sorry.  Yeah.  A regular restaurant in New York City, I mean, four people.  I don't really drink as much as you, but it's probably close to $200 a person at this  point, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's insanity.  I'm not talking like a five-star over-the-top restaurant either. 
[00:51:30]  A middle-of-the-road restaurant will cost you about 200 bills per person now.  You know what the best part of being from New York and around New York and visiting or  living in New York is no matter where you go, you're shocked by the prices.  You just go like, wow, that's cheap.  You do that, too?  Yeah, yeah.  You go to a hotel and you're like, I was expecting like $400.  This is what, $150?  And you throw money around and people think you're a high roller.  And I'm like, no, man.  And it's like a discount.  This is still a discount. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Of course I got you, you, and you.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  You're so right.  I do that all the time.  And then the bill for hotels and stuff, you almost want to go, is this a mistake?  Did you fucking...  Because I don't want you to get in trouble.  Did you go for this?  Yeah, I was expecting for it.  You're so right.  You're so right.  That's like the one upside of paying through the nose.  It feels real good when you get out of this place.  Yeah.  So I thought that was quite a fact.  Wow, that's something.  Probably making just as much as, just about as much as the whole Kansas City roster.  Is A-Rod's chick trying to get him into acting or some shit? 
[00:52:30]  I was reading something about that the other day.  Cameron?  Is he still a Cameron?  Yeah, Cameron Diaz.  I read something about her trying to get him into acting.  He would be a stiff, wouldn't he?  He looks like a stiff.  He looks like he would be as stiff as far as acting goes.  And we've talked about it in the past, but remember the old sitcoms and shows of the  days of yore?  Oh, when the athletes came on?  And they'd come on and they'd be the stiffest things.  Well, why don't we go out back and throw the ball around? 
[00:53:00]  It's so bad.  They all sounded like Rock Quarry.  The better you were at your sport, the worse you were as an actor.  The worse you are.  Right?  Wow, it's Don Drysdale.  Oh my God.  How are you doing, Greg?  It's the worst.  He walked into the classroom?  Yeah, I think it was Don Drysdale.  Because he was going out with a teacher, wasn't he?  Wasn't it?  Yeah, I think something like that.  I think so.  They're horrible.  You're right.  But I am Rock Quarry.  Then you've got the athletes that are kind of okay, a little above average, and then 
[00:53:30]  their acting's a little better.  And the acting's better.  That's how it works.  I miss my fans.  The adulation.  I'll go out.  I'll call myself Gus Schultz.  One of my favorite Flintstone episodes ever.  Flintstones in general.  It's just a great show still.  So we're learning more about the lottery loser?  Yeah, the loser.  The one that didn't chip in with all the co-workers and win that giant mayor.  319 million mega millions jackpot. 
[00:54:00]  He's out because we're learning today, I didn't have two singles.  Now that's all he has.  Oh, the irony.  The irony.  I thought he made a conscious decision like, ah, I'm not playing this one.  Yeah, I don't feel like it.  But he actually didn't have two singles.  So set out, you know what?  No one had change?  They are.  All right, let me read this.  All right.  Because, and then, and listen.  Sounds like they didn't want this guy in.  Listen for, no, listen for the spin, too. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, okay.  If he had a couple of dollars, he'd be living the dream.  He would have been one of the winners.  Okay.  I didn't have two singles is his excuse.  Two dollars.  Said Michael Cosco, who looks like he could possibly be a listener of this radio show, by the way.  Oh, really?  Was he fat?  Yeah.  A six-year employee of the Homes and Community Renewal Agency in Albany.  Homes?  We had played over the past few months.  We never hit anything.  And I just decided that on that particular day, I wasn't going to play. 
[00:55:00]  Cosco said a co-worker even offered to spot him the two bucks, but he declined.  Good choice.  It wasn't my day, he said in the understatement of the millennium.  And he realizes he has no one to blame but himself.  Wah, wah, wah.  Take care of that with a fucking 45.  Yeah.  There's no doubt about it.  They went up and down and asked everyone to get in, and a few of us said no.  There were a few people that said no.  Ah.  Cosco said he and four of his co-workers, who normally bet, so there was more than one. 
[00:55:30]  Four.  But bailed last week, had no regrets, and now call themselves the Five Survivors.  Yeah, it's cute.  I hope that makes you feel better.  You got a cute little name.  Maybe the multi-millionaires could get a nice little t-shirt made for you.  Yeah.  That says the Five Survivors.  That shouldn't take care of everything.  That'll make you feel better.  Yeah.  When you're getting up and going with that god-awful job.  When they bring in pastries for everybody on a Friday just to kind of celebrate the fact  that they're all multi-millionaires and quitting really soon, because the job sounds like shit.  Oh, when you're at a how-is-this-good-for-the-company meeting. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  So there are the Five Survivors, Anthony, and then this guy goes, everything happens for a reason.  The winners deserve it.  They are the hardest-working people I've ever met.  So he's trying to spin it.  And I could have let you borrow the $2 if you really needed it, one of them told me.  Oh, God.  But he and the unfortunate others are taking the high road.  They proudly vowed not to destroy a photocopy of the winning ticket hanging on the office  bulletin board.  We left it there as a souvenir, he said. 
[00:56:30]  A constant reminder of your failure?  Right.  So he's keeping his chin up, which we like around here.  Keep your chin up.  I have a job at the state doing work I love.  No, you're not.  You're working for the state?  You're not doing a job you love.  Just stop.  Besides, he said, after growing up poor in Albany, he feels like he's already won the lottery.  Ah, shut up!  This is such a...  What else is the guy supposed to do?  I know.  It cry?  I would be crying guy in the news.  Fuck it. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not going to sit around and ask myself that question for the next 20 years.  Oh, yeah, you will.  Yeah.  I'm moving on.  It's all good.  It's not all good.  Every day.  And there's hope.  The five survivors might not be shut out entirely after all.  Really?  Are they going to play next week?  While there are no promises, the winners dubbed by lottery officials as the Albany 7 haven't  ruled out sharing.  I told you this.  Yeah.  Sharing some of their newfound cash with their hapless co-workers.  We really haven't had a chance to think about them, winner Kirsten Baldwin said. 
[00:57:30]  Here's a 20.  Keep it.  But winner Leon Peck did not dismiss the idea.  That will be an individual decision, he said.  Yeah.  Meaning I ain't fucking doing it.  Which I should be part of.  That means I ain't fucking doing it, but someone else wants to do that.  It's fate.  Huh?  It's fate.  You can't fucking fly in the face of fate.  If I may use more F words.  I'm telling you, I think the people that play the lottery, I never was a major lottery  guy, but when you...  Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.  I just had a tickle rolling.  I saw that.  It was behind me. 
[00:58:00]  I think when you get stuck playing the lottery, you got to be...  You got to keep doing it.  You got to be.  Yeah.  Because your brain is wired for that shit.  You got to do it because you're just going to feel like shite when you, if you miss out  like these people did.  Oh dude, you did mess it up.  What did I do?  I think this guy's right.  Not that it matters, but Ken in Jersey.  Better Ken.  Hey guys.  Hey guys.  What's up?  Yeah.  Anthony, Wes Parker was the one who was...  Right.  I always do this too.  I think you always do.  No, I always do this.  It's a total mental block that I have for that. 
[00:58:30]  You're right.  You are right, sir.  And Don Drysdale was the one who was trying to tell Greg out of being the million dollar  baby pitcher or whatever.  Right, right, right.  He was trying to talk him out of it by telling him what a drag it is to be in the minors and  take the bus and do all that because Greg thought he was just going to go right to the major  leagues and he wanted to blow off school and shit.  So they got Don Drysdale there to feed him a line of bullshit. 
[00:59:00]  Greg had a lot of dreams.  Greg had a lot of dreams.  A lot of dreams.  The Johnny Bravo thing worked out for a while.  He always wanted to be something that he wasn't.  He was just a dumb suburban kid with a gay father and a mother he would later try to  fuck on a date.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Tampa.  Steve.  Hey there, Steve.  Yes.  I'm in Tampa.  Not only is A-Rod the highest player in baseball, but he's also apparently a slumlord in Tampa. 
[00:59:30]  The news was reporting a couple days ago that he apparently has a couple dilapidated apartment  buildings.  Yeah, I read about this too.  Really?  Yeah.  He's like apparently a slumlord or something or an absentee landlord.  He owns some buildings.  And I guess this happens.  You own some buildings.  You put people in charge.  The thing is, to his defense, which I don't think he needs any, but to his defense, A-Rod's  not the guy that's taking the phone calls from the tenants.  He's not there putting his Yankee cap on backwards so he can fix some plumbing in the basement. 
[01:00:00]  That's what I told my wife.  That's what I told my wife.  She's like, he's a scumbag.  I said, yeah, I know he's a scumbag.  He's a human being.  But as a businessman, I mean, who knows what the fuck?  Do Yankee fans think he's a scumbag?  Uh, he's probably the least liked Yankee, uh, for Yankee fans.  It's easy for me because I'm not a Yankees fan to, what?  What's, what's, what's, what's, something's wrong with your mic, I guess.  So when you talk, this guy seems to still be talking.  Steve, what happened?  What do you got?  Oh, sorry.  No, that's all right. 
[01:00:30]  What, what, what was it?  No, I was just saying that when I was eight years old, I've been a Yankee fan and he's a  douchebag.  He just did.  Yeah, people don't like him.  All right, so you were answering my question.  Thank you.  Yeah, because I, I wonder, because I'm not a Yankees fan, I, so it's easy to hate him,  but I just wonder if the fans.  He is very hateable.  As, as a, as a fan of the team.  Yeah, as a fan, he's not the most liked Yankee, that's for sure.  And secondly, if you're making that much money, why are you making investments and stuff that  could come back to haunt you?  I guess you always think you better, you better pad things and, and, and when you think it's 
[01:01:00]  going to come back to haunt you, it's, it's, it's not A-Rod.  It's A-Rod's company, right?  Right.  And then it invests and buys these buildings.  It hires superintendents and shit like that.  And I'm sure A-Rod doesn't sign off on anything, but it's the, it's the company, the superintendent.  And, uh, you know, I would assume even him, if he hears about it, would be like, Hey man,  I'm, I'm looking like a dickhead here.  Fix this fucking problem.  Yeah, I guess.  I think so.  When you have so much money that you'll never spend your lifetime, I don't know why you 
[01:01:30]  would want those hassles.  You keep wanting them until you have it.  But, but, but think about this.  People look at you like that.  Absolutely do.  Yeah.  But they look at you thinking like, why would he do anything with it?  Why would he still work?  Why do you still come into work?  Why do you do that?  Well, that's going to take care of itself.  People do.  But I also know that I could be making a lot more money.  I just don't bother on dumb stuff.  But I, I think no matter how much money you have or are making, you're still going to want  more to the, uh, because your lifestyle, I mean, I feel like the, I feel like I want 
[01:02:00]  more, but I don't like, I don't like, I don't chase it.  Think if you had a fucking, uh, a private jet, a Gulf stream, a fucking yacht, like a ship,  like, like Arab rich, they still want more because their lifestyle is so huge.  All right.  We're going to go on thin ice right now.  Yeah.  You make a Howard's money.  Yeah.  Why the anger?  Hmm.  Explain that one to me.  Anybody that makes that much money and is angry. 
[01:02:30]  Um, there's always, that's some kind of personal deal.  There's always anger there.  That has nothing to do with the money or lack of, or the, how you're spending your money  or how you're trying to save it.  That's just an internal thing in your head.  And when I was reading that A-Rod thing, you know, where he makes, uh, as much  money as the entire Kansas city team, uh, team, I was thinking, I was thinking Howard  makes as much money as the rest of us schmucks.  We're the Kansas city Royals.  Me and you are members of the Kansas city Royals. 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  And he's A-Rod.  You think it adds up to everyone else that works in this building?  I would say pretty fucking close.  Except for the upper management that just make a shitload of money for doing whatever  they do.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  Because they got stocks and all that crap that we've never been previous.  Why don't we just go down the hall and ask them?  I said, Oh, that's right.  Friday off.  That would be nice.  That's gotta happen.  Things will be changing. 
[01:03:30]  Uh, where were we yet?  Uh, I know, I know.  Uh, there was a couple of calls, but fuck them.  Uh, because it started all over again.  We, we're going to play the home run calls from last night.  Oh, right.  And here's something else I don't understand.  I'm starting to think more people enjoy the home run calls than don't.  I don't like in a way that they goof on them or they actually like them.  No, they enjoy them.  I lose my faith in mankind.  When I hear statements like that, Opie, I lose my faith.  When I look at the local news and some of the stuff they were doing, like the, my faith 
[01:04:00]  when I come in here, yeah, yeah, well, yeah, it's just hard to find the fun.  I'm starting to think I'm having fun still.  I don't want people to think, yeah, I'm having a good time.  I am.  I am too.  See, I was just testing somebody and they failed miserably.  Who?  Iraq.  Oh my God.  He's old.  See, you said it twice.  I said it.  He just didn't even fucking acknowledge.  Iraq just sucks. 
[01:04:30]  I was pulling up old John Sterling calls cause I thought it's where you were going.  You can't multitask.  It's the easiest.  You have the easiest job.  A hero in one hand, a slice of pizza in the other.  Multitasking.  You have an easy job.  Oh, oh, Iraq.  It's easier than a drive-thru window.  I'm telling you.  That is the easiest job right there.  Whatever.  Yankees opening day.  So you got, what's his name there?  The John Sterling.  John Sterling.  We're playing these today because it was opening day.  Don't worry.  We're not going to do this every fucking game because John Sterling, but I was following 
[01:05:00]  Twitter yesterday and every time a Yankee hit a home run, that became a trend on Twitter  for the, for the country, by the way, not locally in New York.  And the, uh, the, the, the phrase was actually the home run call.  So then I'm sitting, so I'm sitting there thinking, uh, holy shit, people actually enjoy  these home run calls.  What do we know?  We're just stupid.  Yeah.  Why do people enjoy these home run calls?  Uh, they're so different and so clever. 
[01:05:30]  No, I mean, seriously though, uh, I, I, I like to give people more credit.  I do too.  I typed in John Sterling into Twitter.  Yeah.  And so I, I, I think, uh, the majority of people might actually be agreeing with us.  Oh, I hope so.  Is it just like, shut up?  You suck.  Read some of these.  Uh, congrats on that opening day win.  According to John Sterling, you guys might never lose again.  You think John Sterling truly feels like he's part of the team? 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Like he's so important.  He's as important as, uh, Dirk.  John Sterling.  Does he get a ring?  Is he one of those people that don't do anything on the field, but they get a ring?  Like don't the grounds people get rings?  Yeah, I think he might.  I think at this point everyone gets a ring.  I think there used to be like only certain people, but now the organization's like.  It should still be a different ring.  Well, it is.  They got some, uh.  Is it?  No diamonds or something.  They got fake diamonds.  Is it really?  They got fake diamonds.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The team gets like rings.  The real shit.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:06:30]  I think.  I was going to say, like that would suck.  Yeah.  What else?  Baseball season's only one day old and I already wish someone would rip John Sterling's vocal  chords out.  All right.  Hashtag it's not about you.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Maybe I misread this yesterday.  Good.  Thank God.  Opening day just ended and I've already heard enough of John Sterling for 2011.  They don't like him very much.  Because it's one of those organizations.  Then you got a goofball doing goofy home run calls.  It doesn't match up.  It's so bittersweet when I'm listening to the radio and listening to the game when I'm not 
[01:07:00]  quite home or something and I'm listening on the radio to know that there's a home run.  And you're like, yes.  But then no, you're going to have to hear some douche chili fucking home run call.  And I'll stop it here again because this goes back to last year. 
[01:07:30]  That, I don't mind.  Even, you know, exaggerating some of the words.  I don't mind that.  It's this what I mind.  Oh, Mark Teixeira.  Good old Tex sends a text message into the right field seats.  You're on the mark, Teixeira.  A three-run blast.  And the Yankees take a 3-1 lead.  He did three of them there.  Is he auditioning for cartoons with the...  Nya-uh.  Nya-uh.  Nya-uh. 
[01:08:00]  I'll get you.  This is Snidely Whiplash with the call.  Nya-uh-uh.  He's got a handlebar mustache.  He's twirling in his fingers.  Nya-uh-uh.  Nya-uh, Mark.  Texted one into the Teixeira.  What?  He's Teixeira-ing that ball with the crowd.  It stinks.  It's funny you bring up the mustache thing.  Yeah.  Observation?  Because I walk around a lot, actually.  Certainly.  Here in this grand city.  Weird mustaches are starting to appear more than usual. 
[01:08:30]  I'm making a lead on that.  I'm leading that trend.  Yours isn't that bad.  Well, I've cut mine down to the...  Well, not now.  I've got to shave.  And I think I'm shaving it completely off for vacation.  Yeah.  Like, right when I get home, I'll videotape it.  It'll be amazing, because I've got to do the Hitler one first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone that shapes does that.  Yeah.  But I've been, like, cutting it down like Clark Gable.  Yeah.  I like doing a Clark Gable one.  It's a little thicker than you've had it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:09:00]  But I...  Or, you know, I like that swashbuckler look.  Well, I saw...  He was a younger guy.  He couldn't have been in...  He probably was in his 20s, and he had a mustache, and then he had the tips waxed.  Oh, really?  But he wasn't going with the Raleigh fingers.  Oh, not the curly Q, but just the tips waxed.  Ah, and here and there, I'm starting to see some weird mustaches out there.  Was he selling elixirs out of a wagon?  He's walking down the sidewalk.  I'm like, well, what are you doing?  I wanted to actually tap him on his shoulder and go, what are you doing?  People are odd.  What are you going for? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Is it a hipster thing we don't know about?  Maybe it is.  Because mustaches are kind of making a comeback in general, but now they're starting to get  a little strange.  Take notice.  I'm going to look around.  I haven't really noticed, but I will look around.  And it's not the older guys, you know.  There's a young mustache thing that is just starting to pop up a little bit.  Hipster thing, I bet.  I bet it is a hipster thing.  I don't know.  Wow, I got to shave then.  A-Rod.  Oh, this is...  Yeah, okay.  This is plays.  The 3-1.  Swung on and hit in the air to deep right center field. 
[01:10:00]  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is off.  The right center field roll.  A-Rod goes to second.  Round second and holds on.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  You fucked up.  Ah.  Ah.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  Ah.  You fucked up chant.  He wanted the A-Rod homer there.  He wanted it.  He said, it is high.  It is far.  And then it was off the wall.  And you thought I was fucking nuts.  Well, look at this.  Dave's got an answer.  David Columbus.  One phone call is going to change my opinion. 
[01:10:30]  Dave, go ahead.  Ah.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Um.  Real quickly, it's Mustache March.  That's why you got so many mustaches around.  Um.  It's the first day of April.  So today I'm going to a mustache bash.  And I'm shaving them off.  It was Mustache March?  Is that why I started seeing them pop up?  How did we miss Mustache March?  I told you I saw them pop it up.  Yes.  So I guess this guy wanted to be the head of the mustache fucking gay party. 
[01:11:00]  Put a little jizz on the corners.  Whatever holds it.  Is it really a Mustache March?  Absolutely.  It's a nationwide thing.  To be honest with you, it's erase cancer awareness.  But, uh.  With a mustache?  How about you just write a check?  Yeah.  How about that?  You're right.  How about you just write the check?  Yeah, we're not all big shots.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, that's true.  But do you actually write a check at the end of Mustache March?  You can actually, you can pick up donations, to be honest with you.  But like I said, we just do it to be kind of goofy.  Well, you are pulling that off, my friend. 
[01:11:30]  Because that is goofy, growing a mustache.  All right, now we're going to get info on Mustache March, even though it's now April Fool's Day.  Yeah.  Very confused.  Too many holidays going on.  It's actually Ass Hair April.  Ass Hair April.  Yeah, you're, people want you to grow all your ass hair out.  As long as you can.  Yeah.  How come ass hair does stop, though?  It knows where to stop.  You don't have to go and get an ass hair haircut.  People do get it waxed like that, bitches and shit.  But it knows to just grow to a certain length and then stop. 
[01:12:00]  I like your hair on your head.  What are you doing?  Cary Grant's here.  It's fucking Cary Grant.  What is he doing?  Cary Grant.  What are you doing?  Hi, boy.  It's Cary Grant.  You're looking...  I just had my hair put on.  You're looking dapper.  You're looking...  What are you doing, Jay Morris?  Feeling dapper, Jethro.  You're looking Hollywood there.  You did look very Hollywood, walking down the hallway with your sunglasses.  It looks like your scarf looks like an ascot. 
[01:12:30]  And you've got a nice jacket on.  You look like...  Well, it's wintertime.  And I'm wearing a Kentucky Fried Chicken t-shirt.  Oh, okay.  Well, I don't know how Hollywood it looks.  That kind of screwed it up.  It's the shades.  It's the shades indoors and using my visitor's pass as a little handkerchief.  And the scarf helps, too.  You've got a scarf.  You never know when the media will be around, Anthony.  Especially when you're a big shot on Broadway.  I was listening to the Jay Moore doing Colin Quinn in Reservoir Dogs bit from years ago.  We played it yesterday. 
[01:13:00]  I know.  I heard that.  That's when I heard it.  I was listening to the guy.  I heard the goddamn words, stupid.  It was so fucking funny, man.  Doesn't Moe Mark Addafi look just like Jeffrey Ross?  Yes.  That's been brought up a few times.  It happened.  You guys have bandied that around.  A little bit.  Yeah, a few people have noticed.  You look like you have a neck twist.  I have a stiff neck.  And it's...  What happened?  I don't know.  I slept funny.  You slept funny.  Ha, ha, ha.  How else could Jay Moore sleep but funny?  I just woke up and I couldn't move my head at all.  Really?  Yesterday.  And then I got a massage. 
[01:13:30]  Acupuncture.  Well, I didn't do the acupuncture yet.  I'm going to go today.  Big audition today.  Really?  You're already in the middle of something.  Oh, I know.  But I got to squeeze it all in, Hope.  I used to have so much heat.  Heat.  You're playing Charlie Sheen.  You know how Dice wears blacks that don't match?  I figured today I would wear whites that don't match.  I figured I'd be the bright white knight.  Yeah, there is.  Good and tender.  The Kentucky Fried shirt.  The beige jacket thing.  It's looking good.  I didn't know what he was doing when he was...  I'm still Sandinista, by the way. 
[01:14:00]  I saw the photo of you and Brock Lesnar, by the way.  Holy fuck.  You look like a Make-A-Wish kid and you want him to sign your mitt.  Believe me.  He fucking...  He squeezed down on my neck for a second and my eyes just bulged down.  At least Anthony was brave enough to tweet the picture.  I didn't even tweet mine.  I'm like, I'm not doing it to myself.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I was just like...  The second he did that, I went, ah!  Like, ah, what are you doing?  You look like you have Pajaria.  After that, I could have.  That's a real-life monster, though.  Brain damage.  He is. 
[01:14:30]  He's an action hero.  Extremely cool guy.  Really cool guy.  He's got a sense of humor.  Likes to laugh.  Those guys, right?  Yeah.  I didn't realize he was cool.  I didn't realize at all.  How was that?  Norm?  It was a short show with Norm.  I don't know, you know.  For some reason, in all the still photos, my head is larger than everyone's, though.  Look how large my head is compared to Anthony's area.  I come from a long line of death. 
[01:15:00]  My father died.  My grandfather died.  And I'm pretty sure his father died.  I haven't met him or anything, you know.  He fought a brave, brave battle with bowel cancer.  It's not really that brave, or battle, for that matter, when you visit the person and  they're laying in a bed with needles and tubes watching Matlock.  It's not really a battle.  No, they're not going, ah, ah, like punching their own body. 
[01:15:30]  And then they say, he lost his brave battle, his brave, brave battle with cancer.  Well, if you die, the cancer dies.  So that's sort of a draw.  He didn't really lose.  He didn't really lose, so why pile on the guy?  He's dead already, you know?  Yeah, he's already gone.  At least give him the draw.  Holy fuck.  Holy shit, is that perfect?  That is right on the fucking money. 
[01:16:00]  God damn, Jay.  Thank you.  That's not my...  Oh, Jay Moore.  You know what?  I apologize for hitting your belt.  No, that's okay.  But he can't move his neck.  Oh, that's unbelievable.  He walked down the hall.  I'm like, I think he's going to play a character today.  I thought you were going to play a character.  I thought you were a sad character.  No, I can't move my head.  I know.  Maybe Cheryl Burke.  How are you going to do an audition?  I can walk on my neck.  With their little, you know, fat potato feet.  Colin, don't say that.  She's coming in.  What the hell do I care?  With a giant labia flopping around the dance floor. 
[01:16:30]  I have a gig tonight in Long Island City, Queens.  I booked it before I got all this heat.  We got Cheryl Burke coming in and Chris Jericho.  Cool.  Chris Jericho, another man.  What's the audition for?  Because you're doing the Charlie Sheen thing.  That's got some heat.  21 Jump Street.  21 Jump Street.  To be the really lazy gym teacher.  Whoa, whoa.  You guys got passes for running around the hallways like idiots?  I think I'm going to do my asses like Ronnie B.  Yes.  That's all I got.  I'm going to go to the Nike store and get like dolphin shorts. 
[01:17:00]  You guys got passes for running around the hallways like idiots?  It's a cross between Ronnie B and Johnny Depp in Platoon.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  This is important.  Maps.  Yeah.  Maps.  It's important.  The tea kettle's still boiling, man.  This is cook stuff.  Let's get out of here.  No, Sal.  This is important.  Maps.  Do it for Manny.  Sal.  So what did I interrupt before everybody starts complaining that I come in and interrupt?  Fucking babble.  We were just babbling. 
[01:17:30]  You actually were way better than what we were in the middle of.  We're doing John Sterling's home run calls.  Oh.  Do you like that?  No, he's a fool.  It is far.  It is gone.  A text message from Teixeira.  Why don't they realize it's an embarrassment to the organization?  It's a late night.  Sorry, I can't even talk.  It's a late night milky delivery.  Oh, yeah.  Milky Cabrera is like, the milkman delivers.  Oh, really? 
[01:18:00]  Vegetable van Gleeson?  Yeah.  No.  The milkman delivers.  Mr. Faber-Sham, the milkman delivers.  The milkman delivers.  If you think that's not a home run, it is out of the question.  Out of the question.  My friend used to work over there.  The guy I knew that I don't talk to anymore, but in showbiz, it's like a big friend.  And he said John Sterling was like, oddly and uncomfortably sexually ambiguous.  Really?  So, I understand you're coming down to spring training with us. 
[01:18:30]  I'll be at the pool in my Speedo.  Nothing better than the video of him having that grand mal seizure with a shake.  Grand mal seizure with his weird fist.  And he goes fist?  He looks like a chimp when he does that.  I don't think the rest of the world or country realizes how absurd.  People here don't realize Ben Scully.  Yeah.  How great he was.  And is.  He's still doing it.  Seven out of the nine Astros starters. 
[01:19:00]  Last name begin with the letter B.  And we've got quite a hive here today with Bagwell, Biggio, Bogar, Baker, and the...  Quite a hive.  He's amazing.  Chad Billingsley threw 18 pitches in the first inning, and he's up to his elbows and alligators  here in the second.  Well, friends.  He's just the best.  He's effortless, though.  He's not forcing it.  No.  And the Yankees, the biggest franchise in the history of franchise history, history.  The redundancy department of redundancy. 
[01:19:30]  How's this?  It'll be a 2-0 to Curtis.  Swung and there goes a deep right.  That ball is high.  And it is far.  And he's gone.  And the second day.  Oh, Curtis.  You're something sort of grandish.  The grandy man can.  No, the grandy man can.  He hovers in the second decade right.  Oh, my goodness, John.  And the Yankees take a 4-3 lead.  Do you have Susan Waldman? 
[01:20:00]  Susan Waldman.  Goodness gracious.  Roger Clemens just said he was coming in George's box.  He's in George's box.  In all my years.  And the smile on Jorge Bessada.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious, you should see what's going  on in the Yankee dugout.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, you should see what's going on, goodness gracious.  Nothing was going on.  The first billion-dollar franchise has those two nitty boots. 
[01:20:30]  The Dodgers got Vince Scully.  The Cardinals had Jack Buck.  Now they have Joe Buck.  Joe Buck.  Everything I say is exactly the same from start to finish.  We hope to have kickoff.  And shortly under an hour, there's a fan on the field lighting himself on fire.  The Giants have scored 17 consecutive touchdowns, setting a record in the NFL.  Well, holy shit, you're right.  That's Mark DeSheris' fifth home run of the game.  Two grand slams, 14 RBIs on the day.  A man has just parachuted onto the pitcher's mound, killing CeCe Sabathia. 
[01:21:00]  Nothing says loving like something from the oven.  That's why this game is brought to you by Enderman's Cookies.  Manning, still on his feet, throws, caught, Tyree, the greatest catch in the history of Super Bowls.  Manning, still on his feet, scrabbles, throws, Tyree, caught.  Now I've got to hear the call.  Oh, shit.  But the greatest catch ever.  And he didn't pump it up at all?  He doesn't have...  Goddamn, Jake.  I'm Gregory Peck.  I'm not breathing here. 
[01:21:30]  You know we interviewed the guy, Tyree?  Oh, shit.  Tyree?  Did you hear what we did?  No.  Because he did a whole book on the catch, and me and Ed said, we don't want to talk to this idiot.  So we gave...  Who was it?  E-Rock and Sam?  E-Rock and Sam played us.  How long ago was this?  Yeah, yeah.  We did a franchise show.  He's out of the business now.  Right after, when he had all the heat, we didn't take it seriously.  We're like, ah, fuck this.  Oh, here it is.  Levels.  Levels.  To your right.  To my right. 
[01:22:00]  Chouts, help him out.  Third down and five.  Pressure from Thomas off the edge.  Eli Manning stays on his feet.  Airs it out down the field.  It is caught by Tyree.  No, Jay's 100% right.  The only thing...  You get a little confused because he's got to, like, talk louder because of the crowd. 
[01:22:30]  But if you take that...  But if you take that...  Cod, Cod!  Oh, no!  Yeah, fuck you.  He did against his helmet, Cod!  Oh, my God!  The Cod is gracious!  That's her problem.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  John, I've never seen David Tyree pin a ball...  Like, Bobby Kelly to his helmet.  Helmet.  You gotta be dialing.  Oh, God, that's great.  And she has the horrible Boston accent.  So how do you have a horrible Boston accent calling Yankee games?  That's sacrilege, too.  I don't get it. 
[01:23:00]  We have a Susan Waldman clip from yesterday.  She gives some bold predictions for the 2011 season.  Bold predictions.  Bold predictions.  May I guess?  May I guess?  How unbold they are?  May I guess?  CeCe Sabathia, Cy Young.  Teixeira, MVP.  A-Rod's gonna have a monster season.  Albert Pujols, MVP.  And look out for Clayton Kershaw, John.  John.  John, yeah.  And a John Steinbrenner zombie invasion.  He does say...  And Ryan Braun, MVP.  That's what's your name. 
[01:23:30]  John.  Actually, the clip, Jay, you're way off.  It's just two minutes of her babbling in the pregame.  Was that it?  Just babbling.  Well, the Yankees are now taking the field for the first time in 2011.  And it's always a wonderful day here.  People are excited.  I'm excited.  I've been up since 5 o'clock in the morning.  I've been waiting for this to happen.  A bunch of morons sitting in the rain in the fucking mall at the Toriyaki Stadium.  Nick was talking about this on the dinner last night we were all at.  He couldn't wait to run out to right field for the first time to greet his bleacher creatures. 
[01:24:00]  And they were waiting for him.  I think John would agree with me.  There is a really good feeling around here.  No, sir.  No, no.  There's not a good feeling.  No, sir.  There's never a good feeling on opening day.  There's a wicked good feeling around here.  No, sir.  I just saw Joe Rogan at the Paki store.  No, sir.  No, sir.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Fucking Paul O'Neill used to rub his fucking cock on the fucking page line. 
[01:24:30]  Who gave a fuck?  Louis got that great.  I don't know.  He probably doesn't do it anymore because he evolves like every year.  He's got a whole nother hour.  He's defying Darwin comedically.  But people from Boston, when they hear good news, they act like so pain like, ah, good  for you, Anthony.  Ah, great.  Oh, there we go.  Tim McCarver right there on L5.  He can't say Williams.  Tim McCarver says Bernie Williams the better.  Williams.  Bernie Williams.  You know, that reminds me.  Ted Williams was the guy. 
[01:25:00]  Williams.  How the fuck do you pick up on that shit?  Holy shit.  He's really good.  Look at the guy on the right.  He's a minor bird, man.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  I know everyone's talking about all kinds of problems that the Yankees are going to have.  There is a very good feeling in this clubhouse.  They had a very good spring, despite everything that is supposedly wrong.  As Joe Girardi said to me the other day, tell me what we can do.  Don't tell me what we cannot do.  I know what we can't do. 
[01:25:30]  I expect, and I think John does, too, I expect a mammoth year from Alex Rodriguez.  I told him a little while ago.  I said, you know, I'm picking you for the MVP of the league.  Don't disappoint me.  I think they are, too.  Huh?  I'm pretty sure they are, too.  Yeah, of course.  If you're going to pay the guy $32 million a year.  $32 million.  $32 million.  What are the problems that everyone's talking about the Yankees having?  You know, Anthony, I've noticed the Yankees.  Not very good drivers.  Big problems.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome from the management people in... 
[01:26:00]  Don't disappoint me.  He started laughing.  Jeter, do not be surprised if Derek Jeter returns to what Derek Jeter has been his entire career.  I always think that batting average is the least important stat that's ever been invented.  Just show me how many...  Wait, wait.  What?  How often you hit the ball is the least important stat for a hitter, you fucking dumb twat?  Yeah, for a hitter.  Tell that to Dave Kingman. 
[01:26:30]  I've always thought...  Horrible stats.  Oh, Dave fucking Kingman.  Exactly.  I'm going way back.  Tommy Lasorda, Dave Kingman.  Dave Kingman.  Does a Tommy Lasorda, Dave Kingman clip?  Somebody goes, how do you feel about Dave Kingman's performance?  And he goes, Dave fucking Kingman.  We might have played that one.  Do we have it?  I got to hear it now.  That is a good one.  Our favorite of all time is Daryl Weaver.  No, nothing's better than...  No, that's not your favorite.  Listen to me.  No.  No.  No, Ope.  Which one is your favorite?  Lee Ilya.  Those are the real Chicago Cub fans. 
[01:27:00]  Kiss my fucking ass.  That's a good one.  85% of the fucking world's working.  The rest of them are here.  It's a fucking playground for the cocksuckers.  Those hillbilly motherfuckers ripped those country cocksuckers.  Oh, shit.  I got fucking Garvey and Say, guys that are busting their fucking ass.  And those cocksuckers, boo, my fucking ass.  We have played this one.  I'm going to challenge you, though, because I think Daryl Weaver is right up there.  Team speed, for fuck's sake.  You know.  Oh, he's great.  Nothing's better than Terry Crowley is lucky he's in fucking baseball. 
[01:27:30]  Terry Crowley.  Here we go.  I'll tell you one fucking thing.  I hope we get fucking hotter than shit just to stuff it up them 3,000 fucking people that  show up every fucking day.  Because if they're the real Chicago fucking fans, they can kiss my fucking ass.  Right downtown and print it.  They're really, really behind you around here. 
[01:28:00]  My fucking ass.  What the fuck am I supposed to do?  Go out there and let my fucking players get destroyed every day and be quiet about it?  For the fucking nickel-dined people to show up?  The motherfuckers don't even work.  That's why they're out at the fucking game.  They only go out and get a fucking job and find out what it's like to go out there on a fucking living.  85% of the fucking world's working.  The other 15 come out here.  A fucking playground for the cocksuckers. 
[01:28:30]  Rip them motherfuckers.  Rip them cocksuckers like the fucking players.  Got guys bustin' their fucking ass and those fucking people boo.  And that's the Cubs?  My fucking ass.  My fucking ass.  They talk about the great fucking support that the players get around here.  I haven't seen it this fucking year.  The name of the game is hit the ball, catch the ball, and get the fucking job done.  Right now, we have more losses than we have wins. 
[01:29:00]  The fucking changes that have happened in the Cubs organization are multifold.  All right, they don't show because we're 5-14.  And unfortunately, that's the criteria of them dumb 15 motherfucking percent that come out to date baseball.  The other 85% are earning a living.  It's coming up.  It'll take more than a 5-13 or 5-14 to destroy the makeup of this club. 
[01:29:30]  I guarantee you that.  There's some fucking pros out there that want to fucking play this game.  Fuck yes.  But you're stuck in a fucking stigma of the fucking Dodgers and the Phillies and the Cardinals and all that sheep shit.  All these motherfucking editorials about say and fucking the Phillies.  Listen to all that shit that's just sickening.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  It's a disheartening fucking situation we're in right now.  5-14 doesn't negate all that work. 
[01:30:00]  You've got 143 fucking games left.  That.  What I'm trying to say is don't rip them fucking guys out there.  Rip me.  If you want to rip somebody, rip my fucking ass.  Lee, you're fired.  Don't rip them fucking guys because they're giving everything they can give.  But once we hit that fucking groove, it'll flow.  And it will flow.  The talent's there.  I don't know how to make it any clearer to you. 
[01:30:30]  I'm frustrated.  I'll guarantee I'm frustrated.  Really?  It'd be different if I walked in this room every day at 8.30 and saw a bunch of guys  who didn't give a shit.  They give a shit.  And it's a tough National League East.  Tough National League East.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That is classically hysterical.  We played that before.  I never heard a guy say, there's 148 fucking games left.  Yeah.  That's what we say.  We go, wow.  Whatever happened to that guy?  You know the history of that?  Fire the next day.  No.  Yes, sir.  Fired the next day.  After only 20 games into the season. 
[01:31:00]  Well, when you tell the fans to kiss your ass downtown, it's a friend.  But he's only telling the fuckers that don't work.  Right.  The ones that show up.  That show up.  Back to Susan Waltman.  Just show me how many runs you score.  How many runs you create for the person in back of you.  And I'll show you a winner every time.  Robbie Cano, the sky is the limit, obviously, for him.  And Mark Teixeira had a terrific spring.  We'll see how that translates.  And we are ready to go.  And here we go. 
[01:31:30]  And as the first batter, Austin Jackson steps up to the plate.  Oh, God.  I hate, this is why I hate the Yankees.  It's like, she's talking about a fucking, somebody's fantasy baseball team that they draft.  Like, you know, CeCe Sabathia, sky's the limit for Robinson Cano, obviously, picked him up in the third round of my draft.  You know, Jeter, don't be surprised if Jeter returns to, like, who the fuck is sitting in their fucking Kew Gardens apartment going like, Jeter hit .310?  What the fuck? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, Jeter, what the fuck?  Somebody's been at the fountain of youth.  Fucking, he had one year, he had 260 out of all of them.  Holy shit.  Don't be surprised if fucking Alex Rodriguez has a monster season.  Don't let that shock you.  What?  How the fuck did she get the shock?  Do you know how many people, present company, all of us?  Oh, that's great.  The guy's in his room.  Oh, that's funny.  Would you love a job like that? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, except for the travel part kind of sucks.  Like, wait, I got to travel with the team?  Can't I just simulcast this shit from my house?  Live from the compound, swing and a mess.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm not going to Kansas City.  No.  See that fucking double A squad?  That used to be the fucking pride and joy.  Remember when we were growing up?  Willie Wilson and...  I don't even remember.  George Brett.  UL Washington had the toothpick in his mouth.  They all had apros and gold chains.  It was like the ABA of baseball.  Holy shit. 
[01:33:00]  Orlando Woolridge was fucking playing.  Oh, shit.  Can we do the Earl Weaver?  Yeah, it's your show.  It's opening day.  It's your show.  Fuck it.  It's opening day.  Let's do the Earl Weaver, too, because it's a challenge.  I think this might be better than the one we just heard.  Now, the manager's corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles' Earl  Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best.  Your area old reveal dealer.  How many of those businesses are no longer a business? 
[01:33:30]  None.  All of them?  Everyone who's a guy.  In Baltimore?  In Baltimore?  Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merrill, wants to know  why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to steal,  getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball at the ballpark and you can't 
[01:34:00]  make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C.  D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated player all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break 
[01:34:30]  one open in a fucking night.  So if this cocksucker had to mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team,  we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lane's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn  street, she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while. 
[01:35:00]  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  fucking Network.  Well, done to the outro music then.  Where's the outro music?  Fucking Earl Weaver was a classic.  Don't be surprised if Alex Rodriguez has a monster year.  A monster year.  Don't be shocked if Derek Jeter returns to farm. 
[01:35:30]  And sky's the limit for Robbie.  That's how you know she's a Yankee broadcaster.  She calls him Robbie instead of Robinson.  Robbie.  Robbie.  She knows him.  I fucking hate the Yankees.  She knows him.  I fucking hate him.  Matt Frost, my stand-up agent, goes, you want to come to the stadium?  I said, they tore Yankee Stadium down.  What are you talking about?  There's no Yankee Stadium.  And he goes, no, I'm being serious.  I go, I'm being serious too.  I would love to go if it was still standing.  You fucking dope.  Going to a mall with a logo on it.  Fucking tear down Yankee Stadium. 
[01:36:00]  You've got to see the new place just once, though.  Why?  Holy shit.  It's just ridiculously awesome.  I'll go to Dodger Stadium.  It's been there since fucking 1812.  Andrew Jackson chased the Indians out of Florida and put them in Dodger Stadium.  That's how long it's been there.  It goes for Anthony.  It's history, yes.  A little history.  We should take a break.  You're not promoting anything.  You're in town doing some shit.  I'm at Foxwoods on the 8th.  You are?  Oh, fuck.  That's next week.  Borgata at the 6th.  Yeah, let's just do Foxwoods.  Foxwoods next Friday night? 
[01:36:30]  The 8th?  Foxwoods.  Fox.  In all my years.  And let me tell you something.  Don't be shocked if Jay Moore's is 40 that night at Foxwoods on the 8th.  He returns to farm.  Fucking dolt.  Jay Moore just killed for an hour and he'll continue with us.  I think we've got Chris Jericho and Cheryl Burke next as well.  Fight!  Fight!  Wait.  Stay there.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Orgy Anthony.  Jay Moore's fucking freestyling. 
[01:37:00]  Jay Moore killed it for us.  Freestyling and shits.  Playing Foxwoods next Friday night.  Playing out.  How do they get the tickets?  Foxwoods.com.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Foxwoods.  They'll figure it out and they should go see Jay Moore.  You should come see me because it holds 2,000 and there's 600 tickets sold.  Wow.  So let's pick it up.  Yes.  Let's sell some more tickets.  But we ain't seeing Jay Moore for fuck's sake.  It's Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Are they legally changing my name to Jay Moore's?  Jay Moore's.  So that the blacks feel more comfortable.  I like to say Jay Moore's.  Anytime I reference you, I say Jay Moore's. 
[01:37:30]  You should.  I love that Jay Moore's.  You know you're my Uncle Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I ain't think you're going to get everybody pregnant.  Can I say something about Jay Moore?  I shot a couple of videos recently.  In the one video, Jay's in makeup, you fucking idiots.  He's playing a Charlie Sheen character on Law & Order.  A junkie.  A half Danish Jew junkie.  I was going through the comments and everyone can't wait to hate.  They just can't wait to do it. 
[01:38:00]  New single, can't wait to hate.  Can't wait to hate.  Can't wait to hate.  And in this case, Jay's made up to look like a cokehead, you dopes.  Yeah.  Jay Moore ain't looking too good.  Is that?  Yeah.  And hair plugs is the other one, too.  What?  Do you have hair plugs?  Yeah.  Can't you see them?  Like, yeah.  My hair plugs, wouldn't I do a better fucking job?  Fucking idiots.  Wouldn't you just make it really full?  Wouldn't I wear a hat for two years like David Spade?  And then come out the other end looking like Ellen? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, it's the same hairdo.  Yeah, it's the same hairdo.  I'm figuring if I can go bald.  I'm 40 now, and it's definitely thinner.  And I don't care about the yarmulke in the back.  I don't give a shit about that.  Because you're tall enough.  If you're tall enough, it doesn't matter.  I never thought about that.  That's exactly what it's all about.  If you're tall, it's a part of the matter.  If you're like 5'8", it's like, oh boy.  Fuck, you worry.  But if you're like...  Hmm.  They're looking down at my bones, buddy.  The Grandy Man can. 
[01:39:00]  The Grandy Man.  What a fucking...  Let's not get...  Let's never...  Let's make a promise with each other.  Blood Brothers, like Springsteen, fucking The River style, right here.  Yeah.  Let's never...  Let's stay tethered to John Sterling as far out as we go.  Yes.  Let's stay tethered to the Candy Man can.  The Yankees win.  It's something sort of grandious.  What?  A late night milky delivery.  Ew.  Ew. 
[01:39:30]  Those eggs smell like Jimmy's here farting.  Ah.  I know.  Eggs are the worst.  It's just eggs and cheddar.  Are you a fucking wise guy?  Are you fucking wise?  I guess so.  Eggs are really bad.  Like, I don't know.  They just make that smell.  What's a tattoo, sweetie?  That's something that you won't know.  It's just old and it's just, you know.  I'll show you something you don't know.  It's hard to explain.  It's not like, oh, it's, you know, some logo.  What's that say?  I can't see from here.  Yeah, so you don't know either.  So fucking, what's up? 
[01:40:00]  I don't know.  God damn.  Just eating breakfast.  Eat your halibut, mind your business.  Flamingo kid.  Eat your halibut, mind your business.  Remember the very end of Flamingo Kid?  There they go with the movie references again.  You guys got to follow me.  Just quit Twitter and just fucking get off social media entirely.  I mean, Anthony can't because that's how he meets every fucking...  Well, you know.  Are you back on Twitter?  I'm on Twitter.  I quit Twitter.  But people don't believe you're going to quit.  Did you quit?  Yeah, you quit.  Why would anyone be on Twitter? 
[01:40:30]  I know.  To fucking sell tickets?  It's just to show off, like, look how funny I was today with my little quip.  It is...  Mine are just full of arguments.  All I do is argue with people and then realize, what am I doing?  Why would I do this?  I liked your photos at the Polo Lounge.  Oh, yeah.  You know, those are cool.  Yeah, no, that was.  Oh, I was just saying.  But don't tell Lenore.  Out of the Beverly...  But don't tell Lenore because I'm not taking her.  Do whatever you got to do.  Oh, I will.  No. 
[01:41:00]  Jake, would you stop?  You know, take the girls out one last time.  Did Melissa do a scene with you or something?  But don't tell Melissa because I ain't taking her.  Don't tell Melissa.  All right, do what you got to do.  Oh, I will.  She said you were very funny.  She was very nice.  Yeah, she did.  She had a tough gig.  You know, you just get made up for like three hours because they got to make their hair like four feet tall.  They got a bride of Frankenstein hairdo.  And then you just stand there in a photo shoot and they're like, no, go sit over there with the fucking...  With James Moore's.  No, the Bizarre Extra table.  No, of course the Bizarre Extra. 
[01:41:30]  She got home that day.  I was like, she rode on the fucking subway like that and on the Long Island Railroad with her hair like that.  Like, what the fuck?  Don't she got a brush?  There's some freaks on the train now.  Yeah, that's true.  I was laying in bed and I had a dream that I died and God was going over my life.  This is after I quit Twitter.  This is profound.  And I realized, first of all, the last tweet I had was, just found out we're doing Suicide Kings 2 in June. 
[01:42:00]  All capitals.  Yeah.  The next 40 responses were, I mean, some of them were funny, like, Mannequin 2 thinks this is a terrible idea.  Oh, come on.  Like, that's great.  When will you be opening for Paula Poundstone at a steakhouse?  Like, who cares?  Wow.  Will you ruin that one also?  You suck.  You're a fucking piece of shit.  So I just retweeted all, like, 20 negative things.  And I wrote, this is a fucking crazy place.  This is stupid.  Yeah, why?  I don't want you to have a direct line to me.  Yeah.  The only line I want you to have to me is the box office line when you buy a, and I love you. 
[01:42:30]  You come see me perform.  You're going to, I'm going to give you every fucking thing I got.  Yeah.  All of it.  And then we'll meet and greet afterwards, and it's a whole thing.  But no one, my wife had a good point.  She said, Twitter should be for people only with SAG cards.  And you all start at the same time.  Monday at 2.15 in the afternoon Eastern time, go.  Not fuck, you know, you suck. 
[01:43:00]  And you're like, what the fuck did I do to you?  And then the guy goes, you just fucking suck.  Saw you in hereafter.  Nice fucking hair.  You're obviously going bald, and you have no talent.  You're like, no, they made my hair that way to make my character pathetic.  And then you go, why am I arguing with vet guy 420?  When he knows I am Jay Moore, who lives in Santa Monica, California, and my child's name,  and my wife's name, and my entire IMDB page, and you have a picture of fucking Jesse Ventura  from Predator as your picture.  Like, why am I arguing with you? 
[01:43:30]  This is fucking perfectly what that is.  Perfect description.  My wife said, the internet is the world's largest bathroom stall.  Instead of Twitter, get everyone a fucking Sharpie and a rent-a-car.  And you drive up the fucking turnpike, pull over at the Dolly Maddison rest stop, and  write, you have no hair, you suck, and your wife is a fucking piece of garbage, and then  leave, and then another guy comes in to take a shit and goes, fuck you!  You fucking suck!  And just have, it'll just take a lot longer.  That's exactly what it is. 
[01:44:00]  I was saying once that Twitter is like when you used to write shit on your desk in school  to the guy like, hey, the guy that sits here in third period, you're a faggot.  Van Halen rocks.  No, they don't.  No, they don't, well, fuck you, you motherfucker, and that's exactly what this is.  Van Halen's for pussies.  Exactly what this is.  Hey, what you just said, this is like an AA meeting.  My last tweet was...  Hi, I'm Jay Moore, and my last tweet was...  I was on JetsInsider.com arguing with this guy, Megalomaniac was his handle. 
[01:44:30]  Okay, great.  That's a good handle.  He had a picture of Jimmy Page and his, what is it called, avatar?  Yeah, whatever.  Sigpick and an avatar are different.  Yeah, they're about the same pick.  Avatar is the one next to your name.  And Twitter, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a picture of Jimmy Page, and I'm like, we're going back and forth about the Jets,  and then I'm like, you don't know what you're talking about?  He goes, well, what the fuck do you know?  When are you going to make Pauly again?  And by the way, for the record, everybody, Pauly's a good movie.  Like, I stand by Pauly. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  If you have a niece or a...  Like, it's not for fucking you idiot 40-year-old Long Island patch hog asshole smoking grass in your mom's bed.  Nothing, ma.  And then going out to see Pauly.  It wasn't for you.  Ma!  Oh, I've got to smoke this now!  I'm going to see Pauly with all my friends.  Both of them.  And then, yeah, so I was arguing with this guy on Jets Insider.  I mean, this shit went on for a year.  Oh, my God.  Like, my post count went up just to tell this guy he was an idiot.  Then he changed his avatar photo, and it went from Jimmy Page to a picture of him at his prom. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, shit.  His fucking prom!  Prom.  I was arguing with a fucking 16-year-old.  A fucking child is telling me Curtis Martin is a first ballot all the time.  And I'm like going, yeah, maybe not.  You know, he's kind of a compiler as a Jets fan.  You never once left a Jets game going, fucking Curtis Martin.  Can you believe that shit?  But you always go, you read in the paper, you go, 120 yards. 
[01:46:00]  Like, I didn't even notice.  And you're saying this to a fucking 16-year-old.  But you don't know, I think it's like this cool Jimmy Page guy.  Yeah, Jimmy Page.  Why would he?  Fucking daltz.  And now what's great is Twitter, I changed my password and gave it to Frosty, and so I  can't even get on if I want to.  Right.  And then when I see, you have like 14 new, it's still, if I took out my phone and showed  you the mentions, like, people are still going like, you didn't really quit, did you?  Like, hey, I just saw Hereafter.  Did somebody dip you in acid? 
[01:46:30]  Like, I'm done.  I'm out of the fucking game.  And it just still continues.  Yeah.  People are scumbags.  But when you say, I just saw you in Hereafter, you're saying, I just saw you in a Clint Eastwood  movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You suck.  Yeah.  You can't mesh those two together.  I mean, you could if I really sucked in the movie, but I didn't.  I thought I was very good.  And one review said underplaying for once, and I agree.  Oh, really?  I'm learning how to go under the radar a little bit. 
[01:47:00]  You don't have to fucking show.  You were in a movie with Clint Eastwood.  How does anyone spin that?  I can't express to you how little this fucking movie is about you.  That Clint Eastwood story you told?  I love that.  That's one of the best ones.  My problem was never drugs or alcohol.  My problem was always P-U-S-S-Y.  And then you become so enamored with the guy that you find that he's doing like J. Edgar  Hoover with Leo DiCaprio, and you're like, I could have played somebody. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  I would have laid on my back with my legs in the air for J. Edgar Hoover.  Whatever you need.  So yeah, Twitter is just, I don't need a social network where people that I don't know can  directly tell me I suck.  And then conversely, I can't have it be a thing where the only reason I'm on it is so  people can directly tell me I'm great.  That's disgusting to me also.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to, you don't just want to ass kissers.  But the hate, the hate that people can conjure up, and just the shit. 
[01:48:00]  And the fact is, if you're doing something amazing, that's one thing.  If you're showing your picture up there, and here's what I do, here's my body of work,  and you sit there and just go, wow, that guy's fucking talented, I did something, and I guess  I am a piece of shit.  But like you said, he's fucking, you know, never, they never show their face, it's always  some fucking cool picture they got from Google Images.  It's a picture of the ultimate warrior.  Yeah.  And they're doing nothing.  They have two fucking followers, and I'm going to give them the time of day, and then let 
[01:48:30]  all of my followers see this guy's comment.  No, I send them a private message usually, and go, hey, asshole, no one's ever going  to see what you wrote.  Blocked.  And then just block them.  And they're gone, they never get the satisfaction of getting their shit out there to everybody  that follows me, and I never have to read them again.  So fuck them.  It's great.  Patrice said that it's like giving your cell phone number out to people so they could  beat you up.  So they're not there if they're calling you, but it's a text. 
[01:49:00]  It's on your phone.  It's a fucking text.  People are texting you.  He goes, here's my cell phone.  Here's my number.  Text me.  Here you go.  Every asshole in the world.  Why would you do that?  Go ahead.  Text me.  Why would you do that?  Why do you do it?  I don't know.  Why do you do it, Oak?  I'll answer for you.  Yeah.  Because you thought going in, we're going to get the fan base going grassroots.  This will help the show.  Absolutely.  A show will help.  And you realize with any show, radio or television, any fan site or message board about that show  are a bunch of people fucking bitching about their favorite show. 
[01:49:30]  That's it.  Like, holy shit, I fucking love Glee.  Hey, let me go on the Glee message board.  That show sucked.  You're a bunch of faggots.  Fucking Glee.  Why don't they let Kurt sing more?  Oh, man.  I know everyone on Glee.  I'm a Gleek.  Are you a Gleek?  Love Glee.  This just turned into an intervention.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Now I'm feeling like I should quit.  Did I just have my last tweet?  I feel like I should quit.  God, I hope it wasn't a fucking sunrise.  What was your last tweet?  And I did your mom's box on my last tweet.  You did it?  Yeah.  Hey, you did it right.  It's nice to know you're following.  Anyway.  I'm going to see what my last tweet was. 
[01:50:00]  Hold on.  We got 14 mentions now.  I'm not on Twitter, you fucking apes.  Okay.  We got to get the guys in.  We got Chris Jericho and Cheryl Burke down the hall.  So get them in here immediately.  They only got like 20 minutes.  For a man that looks like he was a chromosome wiggle away from being a family bird and Jay  Moore is brilliant.  Even the compliments are mean.  The compliments suck.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I don't know what that's about.  Because they claim to be fans of the show and it doesn't seem that way. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, what are they doing?  Dancing with the Stars, right?  Chris Jericho.  Chris Jericho is coming in.  He's doing that Dancing with the Stars.  That's a strange show, you know.  You dance to Foxtrot.  I can't tell if he's behind me or not.  So I can turn my head like this.  Chris Jericho is a badass.  Chris Jericho is a badass.  We'll see.  He's the best fucking norm, man.  Jay Moore, calves of an angel.  Ah, see?  That's from Opie's thing. 
[01:51:00]  There you go.  Opie filming my underwear.  Ah, there he is.  Look at how fucking dapper you're looking, man.  God damn you.  You're looking more and more Hollywood, bro.  You look Hollywood.  I got damn sweats on today.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Look at you, man.  We've known both of you guys for a very long time.  Cheryl Burke.  I don't know why we're not giving the attention to the beautiful girl.  Hi, Cheryl.  Beautiful girl.  We are.  Chris Jericho.  Where were we last night, Cheryl?  Kit Kit Club?  Did you guys go out last night?  No, man.  Why not?  You got to just keep dancing. 
[01:51:30]  Kit Kit Club?  We rehearsed until like midnight, and then we came over here, so I have to be responsible  now during the course of this show.  This is like a lot of work, real work, right?  It's a lot of work, more than you ever expect when you first sign up for it.  I mean, it literally is like six or seven hours a day, every day, and you need that time  to be somewhat decent, if you're going to be somewhat decent.  What dance are you guys working on?  This week we're doing the rumba.  The rumba.  The rumba.  The forbidden dance.  Last week we did the quick step, and the week before that we did the cha-cha. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Would you ever have thought that Jericho would be doing the cha-cha?  I did.  You did?  You've thought about it for years, right?  Yeah, when I see you, you've got the moves of an angel, man.  You're very dexterous and, you know...  Ambidextrous.  I can move both ways.  I can move both ways.  I said fucked up and went, oops.  Yeah.  Now that's serious.  Did the wrestling career help you with this?  Yeah.  You know, choreographing moves and remembering what you're supposed to do.  Well, I haven't wrestled to high school, Anthony, but...  Well, no, Jim Moore.  I was talking to Chris.  Oh, Chris.  You're talking to me.  I thought, okay, because the comedy helped me. 
[01:52:30]  It's interesting because there's a lot of stuff that you do in wrestling that you can  actually transpose into dancing.  Balance.  When you suplex your partner.  Weight distribution.  Greatest thing.  She's actually a firecracker.  Yeah.  She's a taskmaster.  So, aren't you, Cheryl?  Yeah, I'm just moody.  Are you really?  Do you tell them what the hell are you doing?  Come on, knock it off.  Yeah.  Why are you moody?  Very good.  She has a reputation of being, like, the master, the taskmaster of the show because she's very 
[01:53:00]  blunt.  And, you know, in Hollywood, as you know, Jay, everyone tells you what you want to hear.  They're always kind of stroking.  That's Twitter.  That's why I come in here.  Tell me I'm an idiot.  This is Kyle Bad.  This cuts you right back down to size coming on this show.  But Cheryl's not like that.  She tells you what you need to hear to get better because you don't have a lot of time  to do the different routines and stuff like that.  So, balance, weight distribution, choreography, live performance, all that stuff is kind of  wearing spandex and rhinestones.  I mean, hey, that's exactly what I've been doing for 20 years. 
[01:53:30]  Who's gotten kicked off?  Because I don't really...  I watch a little bit.  Mike.  From Kevin and Bean.  We were just talking about it.  And from Loveline.  Yeah, he's one of Drew...  He was their Jimmy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he made it to Dance with the Stars.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was actually a really funny guy.  He's a great kid, man.  Yeah, he actually hosted Regis, too.  He might be the new Regis.  Does Wendy Williams look like a monster in person?  She's a big lady.  Holy shit.  It's like being in the Post with Kurt Thomas.  She's a fucking power forward if I've ever seen one. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, she is a big lady.  She just has to be...  If you shrink her down, then I think she might be hot.  But she's way too fucking large.  She's purple.  She's big.  Yeah, she's big.  She's an odd shade.  I mean that as pragmatically as possible.  Of course.  You're being polite.  Like when Al Roker lost all the weight, he turned gray.  Yeah, yeah.  She's that weird...  She's got a strange hue to her.  She does have a strange...  Maybe hue is the better word.  The hue.  In these politically correct times.  Yes, exactly.  My fucking show's canceled.  What do I care?  She's a fucking strange-looking black lady. 
[01:54:30]  Okay.  Man.  Black man.  Which one is she?  Cheryl wants out already.  Wendy Williams is such a strange-looking black person.  Kim Kardashian just fucked her.  Oh, shit.  No?  I don't even know if that makes sense.  Well, because, you know...  It kind of does.  She's got a manly...  Chris Humphreys from the Nats.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I know you get it, but I got to...  She has a type.  You got to explain for the listeners sometimes.  She has a type.  Yeah.  Cheryl, I apologize for my potty mouth.  It's all right.  How many seasons have you done this?  Dance with the Stars.  That's my 11th season.  11?  Girl, you paid. 
[01:55:00]  Who did you have in the past?  Drew Lachey, my first season.  Emmett Smith.  He won, didn't he?  Yeah.  She's won twice.  She's a two-time champion.  Oh, boy.  Not a three-time, though.  You won with Emmett?  Thanks for the thumbs up on that.  I'm not a three-time.  No, man.  Emmett Smith.  Geez.  All 11 of my votes are going to Jericho.  Ocho Cinco.  Yes.  You had Ocho.  Rick Fox.  She gets all the athletes.  Wait, wasn't there a rumor of you and Ocho?  No.  Not at all.  It was out there, though.  That was quick.  No, it wasn't.  She tried.  She wants out of that.  She wants out of that rumor.  Now doth protest too much. 
[01:55:30]  That rumor should not happen.  He was playing it.  See, I know a little bit about the show.  He was working a little bit.  Shale gets the athletes all the time.  Were you ever romantically linked to any of your dancers?  Be honest.  No one listens to the show.  Wayne Newton and I, you know.  Tony Shaw.  Tom DeLay has a horse cock.  Apparently.  It's funny because it's true.  That's the Jericho we remember.  I never went anywhere.  Just because I'm a dancer now doesn't mean that I don't.  You're not even a dancer yet. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, shit.  See, there you go.  Now you're sort of there.  No, she didn't.  No, you're Jordan's all fucked up.  Now you're bringing up.  Jay Morris.  You my uncle.  I'm going to get Chris Jericho pregnant.  Tracy Morgan on dating.  I hope so.  That's why they called it an impression, Chris Jericho.  It took me a couple minutes to get hip to that one.  I'm going to get Tom Bergeron pregnant.  Make Bergeron babies.  Yeah.  Babies.  Holy shit.  So who do you think on the show this season has a chance that you're looking at going, 
[01:56:30]  uh-oh.  Other seasons have had ringers in the past.  Like one of the Pussycat Dolls did it.  And an Osmond did it.  Those damn Osmonds.  Yeah.  They're dancing since they were embryos.  Always freaking dancing.  Last year was the chick from Dirty Dancing.  But this year we don't have anybody.  And her new face.  She doesn't even look like her anymore.  Everything was dancing but her face.  It was frozen in the position for her. 
[01:57:00]  You know what I say?  God bless.  Yes.  Go for it.  Right?  Yeah.  You're talking about working it.  I think she's like 60 or something.  So she looks great.  But for this season, there's really like a, it's kind of a wide playing field.  Yeah.  Because there's a lot of people that are doing good, but no one's really had any previous  dance experience.  What about Ralph Macchio?  Ralph is actually pretty good.  Is he good?  He keeps working this gimmick where he's like, oh, I'm so old and I'm hurt and my body hurts.  And he gets out in the dance floor and just fucking kills it.  So I think he's working a little bit of a wrestling gimmick where he's trying to shark 
[01:57:30]  you.  Like a pool shark.  I don't know how to play pool.  And then he gets all the...  He looks like a dancer.  He's got Pajaria.  He's got a...  70 years old, Norm Macdonald, on Dancing with the Stars, Ralph Macchio, has Pajaria.  He was in that karate kid, you know?  In 1941, they showed it to the troops.  Now I... 
[01:58:00]  Are we talking about the Rifleman?  Chuck Connors.  God damn it.  You've got the Norm Macdonald smile.  He smiles as he goes.  Like an idiot staring at the sun, yeah?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Chris Jericho has a successful career as a WWE superstar.  And now he's dancing.  But at least you've got the beautiful Cheryl Burke there, yeah?  She's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful gal. 
[01:58:30]  But I wouldn't mind dancing with at all.  That's great.  That's the most we've heard of Norm Macdonald in years.  Boy-oh!  He was on two days ago.  Oh, there you go.  I didn't listen two days ago.  Cheryl, what partner have you had...  Dancing...  Excuse me.  Let me make that more specific.  What dancing partner have you had, and maybe you have a confidentiality agreement and you  can't see, can't say, was pretty difficult personally.  Like, what's wrong with this person?  Why can't they just do what I say and we could win if this person would just... 
[01:59:00]  Chris!  No!  You two!  He keeps trying to watch us.  You two!  These two!  So, you know, I think the actors that I've been with, I think because of their insecurities...  Names, please.  I can't.  Show me.  I can't name specific names.  Kick-Kick.  Show me.  But you can go through the list.  If Sam Googles who our partner's on...  Yeah, that's true.  Instead of standing there with a stupid smile on his face...  Instead of holding that camera with that fucking bunch of asparagus for hair.  Yeah, exactly.  Because Kramer's just getting out of control now. 
[01:59:30]  His whole food...  I like how he wears it back with, like, a barrette.  Yeah, what the fuck?  When have we seen a barrette since 1965?  You look like you're in the produce section of fucking Whole Foods, you idiot.  Put the fucking camera down and look it up, stupid!  See, the thing is, a lot of people...  Ramen noodles.  I know that, dude.  A lot of people think when you do this show that you're instantly going to be a ballroom dancer.  And it takes 20 years to be like if I said, okay, you're going to learn how to wrestle  openly in two weeks.  Oh, fucking no.  You know, it takes years and years and years and years, you know, stand-up comedy, anything. 
[02:00:00]  10,000 hours.  Well, more.  Maybe 12,000 hours.  12,075 hours of learning you need.  So you can't just waltz in, no pun intended, and become a ballroom dancer.  Some people think they can do that.  It's impossible.  You have to realize that this show is not built on the dancing, per se.  It's built on the show business aspect, the personality, the character, the charisma,  all that sort of stuff.  It gives you more exposure.  Let me tell you something.  It does.  But you do learn quickly.  You do learn quickly.  You don't care if you learn how to dance.  Let's be honest. 
[02:00:30]  Well, you have to do the best you can.  Not for the celebrities.  It's great exposure for Christian.  They have a reason why they do the show.  Are you guys middle of the pack?  No, we tied for first last week, so that's not middle of the pack.  What actor?  I still want to know what actor.  Well, E-Rock's got the list.  E-Rock's on it?  Yeah.  Her first partner, Drew Lachey.  Lachey.  Oh, Lachey.  Drew Lachey's on there.  He was a good one.  Look at the game tape.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, E-Rock.  He did not just do that.  It'll get better as it goes on. 
[02:01:00]  How could you get Lachey from Nick Lachey?  It's an easy transition.  Damn it.  Then you have Emmett Smith.  Emmett Smith.  Tell me who you are.  Just spin the wheel.  Ian Ziering?  Uh-oh.  It's actually Ian Ziering.  And he thinks he's hot shit because he married like a penthouse from the 80s?  Like, wow, here's my fucking prime pussy.  I'm ready to fucking treat everyone like an asshole because look what I got at home.  Hey, Ian, look what I got at home.  Suck my balls.  Have you ever met anyone with the name A-I-N? 
[02:01:30]  That's Ian.  Ian, okay.  Ian.  Not Ian, Ian.  Was Ian a pain in the ass?  Uh, no.  I'm going to wear you down.  You can't do that.  Jay will wear you down.  I'm not talking about words.  I can't get fired from my show.  You can't get fired from saying who was a jerk?  Really?  No, I just said who was a little, uh, very difficult to work with.  I said mainly all the actors I've been with.  So Ian Ziering was difficult to work with.  For the reason that they think they can be ballroom dancers easily, right? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, I'm your ballroom dancer.  Dancer for me.  That one was okay.  I like the other one.  What was the other one before that?  Michael Madsen?  No, that was a good one, Chris.  Oh, shit.  No, it's got to tell.  He's got a lot of good ones.  He's got a lot of good ones.  No one does Tina Turner.  Jericho turned it into a goddamn shooting gallery.  Harvey Keitel?  Bam!  Keitel.  Bam!  If we could just get Cheryl Burke to tell us what we need to know, who was difficult  to work with, then we will know. 
[02:02:30]  Ian Ziering?  Bam!  Turned it into a goddamn shooting gallery.  What the fuck was Joe thinking to hire an animal like that?  Can you do Opie or Anthony?  Holy shit.  All right.  All right.  We want to get something out of this interview.  Ian Ziering, we don't want to talk about the Foxtrot.  We don't want to talk about the Foxtrot.  By the way, a completely misnamed dance. 
[02:03:00]  You think it's going to be hot and jumping around.  The Foxtrot's super slow and deliberate and plodding almost, right?  Yeah.  Dance talk.  Well, whoever knows any of these dances, you show up there and it's like, this week you're  going to be doing the rumba.  It's like, what the fuck one is that?  We don't know.  I've never heard of any of these things before.  Why are you cursing me?  I'm trying to keep up with you.  Do it on your friends.  I do one imitation.  Do it on your friends.  I do one imitation.  Yeah.  I'll do my Lars Ulrich imitation.  So I fucking went on to the Sirius radio with Opie and fucking Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  I was sitting right next to Jay Moore.  He was so fucking crazy.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  That's my one imitation.  He was in Get Into the Greek, wasn't he?  He was.  Lars.  Who's on the phone, babe?  Who's on the phone, babe?  Get Russell Brand out of here.  He's got a big fucking cock.  Who else?  I love that impression.  That's all I can do.  That's all you need is one good one.  You get one.  That's it.  I got my one.  Then you have Wayne Newton.  Wayne Newton is the nicest guy in the world.  My wife said Wayne Newton, not only the nicest guy in the world, the greatest smelling man 
[02:04:00]  in the world.  He smells pretty good.  He smelled like heaven and the inside of a Porsche.  He does.  He smells good.  He was a guest star in Las Vegas.  Why does he smell good?  He's fucking Wayne Newton.  Just good cologne?  Who the fuck are you?  He showers every day.  The best cologne.  To ask that.  In Vegas.  Well, I mean, is it in us?  He has spent his entire career rolling around with other men.  I think it's the kind of rubbed off of him.  Watch it.  Watch it.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  I can't turn my head.  Jay was a wrestler back in the day.  Watch it.  Jay's got a fucked up neck there. 
[02:04:30]  Did anyone ever pull that finger move on you where they jam their finger in the guy's  asshole?  I heard about that wrestling move.  Only until it came.  That's good.  You get a front headlock on a kid.  You roll them.  And your coach is like, legs, legs.  Is he like, not yet?  What was the bit that you did where you were banging a chick and you pulled out and left  the state of Hawaii?  Mapa Hawaii.  Mapa Hawaii.  That's like your famous, that's your rock and roll all night.  That's a classic.  He does a show.  That's his walk this way of comedy.  That made it on a t-shirt. 
[02:05:00]  Mapa Hawaii.  I made it on a t-shirt.  That's his walk this way.  That's his biggest hit.  You know, I go, I'll do shows and people go, do walking.  I'm like, have you ever seen the fucking Eagles in concert?  Do you sit there and yell Hotel California the second you hit your chair, idiot?  It comes at the end.  Don't worry about it.  So people do yell for it.  Wow.  But now they yell for Tracy too.  Yeah.  And then they're going to start yelling for Cheryl.  Cheryl and I are going to actually, we should announce it.  We're touring together.  Yes.  My torpedo of truth.  Charlie Sheen. 
[02:05:30]  Winning.  We're talking about an Oscar.  Man, I won one when I was 20.  I wasn't even warm.  Where does Charlie Sheen keep his imaginary Oscar?  In his unicorn's ass?  Fuck, he didn't win an Oscar.  That fucking asshole.  Is he coming to town?  He's a man.  Yeah, Radio City twice.  Are you guys going?  You have to.  We might, just to check it out.  I'm going.  What's he going to do?  What's he going to do?  3,000 seats not sold.  He said he's going to riff.  Really?  They sold out.  I thought he sold out.  They sold out, but it was all ticket brokers.  Ticket brokers are saying they had a big ticket.  They're going broke.  They can't get rid of these things. 
[02:06:00]  He's going to riff.  What's he going to riff on?  I was just going to do sayings.  Bill Maher had on.  He's going to riff.  Belzer.  And they were talking about.  And the guests were like, I think it'll be great.  And they go, yeah, for about nine minutes.  And then Belzer goes, then it's going to be a slow, anxious crawl to 930.  Fuck it.  He's going to be like, who wants to see Brie Olsen's tits again?  When I was a kid, goddesses were way hotter in my mind.  I don't think you pulled a couple sixes out of the San Fernando Valley, Bob's Classy Lady. 
[02:06:30]  And a goddess to me, like Cheryl, she's a beautiful.  Bob's Classy Lady.  It is.  Like Cheryl's seriously like a gorgeous girl.  She's in phenomenal shape.  You see her in the news.  They always get pictures of you like, you've got to stay out of Maui.  That's where the paparazzi is.  Unless you go because you want your picture taken.  No, not at all.  Because you've got that hot rockin' bod in the bikini in Maui.  Happily married, babe.  Don't read into it, babe.  Let's throw a little babe in there.  B-Rock, who else?  Then you have Christian De La Fuente. 
[02:07:00]  I don't know who the fuck that is.  Who is that?  Is he the guy that showed his cock in Sex and the City?  No.  I can't believe he was available.  No clue.  No.  He's some Latin sub-star.  Oh, he's a Latin sub-star?  Fucking J, man.  Okay.  Who else?  Maurice Green.  Athlete.  He's the runner.  He's the runner.  Oh, yeah.  The athletes.  That shows for the athletes.  Giles Marini.  Gilles Marini.  Gilles Marini.  Oh, my God.  You are butchering all that.  It's fantastic.  We don't know that guy either. 
[02:07:30]  Who is Gilles?  But I'm not reading it.  He's the guy that showed his cock in Sex and the City.  Oh.  That's what he's known for.  They actually hired his cock.  Cock trivia with Chris Jericho.  Hired his cock to dance.  Gilles Marini's cock was actually the one that was listed to dance.  Now, Cheryl, when you date outside of the show, obviously, because...  She's suffering.  Look at her.  I don't want to make you uncomfortable.  You're so not.  Go ahead.  You're suffering.  Believe me.  You have a bit of jungle fever, correct?  No.  Don't lie.  Oh, damn.  Sometimes.  Sometimes is all the time if you're a white person. 
[02:08:00]  That's true.  We look at that as all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  What is this?  1987?  To Anthony?  Jungle fever?  I'm just speaking for Anthony.  Yes.  People are like...  Jungle fever?  We like the moral school sometimes.  That really is better.  Aren't you glad I never slept with a black guy?  I got to realize this all has traction and fucking six years from now, I'll be applying  for a Tyler Perry movie, and they'll pull this fucking quote up and go.  I knew you said this one.  Nope.  Tyler Perry.  I like this Jay Moore kid. 
[02:08:30]  Has he ever said anything?  So Ian Zaring was a pain in the neck.  You can nod or shake your head, and I will not out what you're...  Well, who knows?  Who knows?  Who knows?  Okay.  Who knows?  She doesn't want to get in trouble.  The show is called Dancing with the Stars, I understand.  When do you guys dance next?  Monday.  Every Monday.  So what?  All weekend?  So that's the thing.  No, you're not going to practice all weekend, all right?  Every day, man.  You got five days.  Because he's a fucking man.  You got five days to do this. 
[02:09:00]  To figure it all out.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, you're already in the studio doing  rehearsals and stuff, so this schedule's nuts, man, because this training is some of the  hardest training that I've ever done, and you guys know all the stuff that I've done  over the years, but this is fucking crazy because it's like aerobics and yoga combined.  There's so much stuff you don't even realize when you're learning to do this when you watch  it on TV because they make it look so easy as far as positioning and frame and toes down,  heels up, shoulders down, elbows up, chin up, and it's all like, ah, it's too much to 
[02:09:30]  remember.  So you really have to spend seven, eight hours a day to do this.  That's, you never expect that.  What's great have you lost so far?  Probably about 10 pounds or so.  Now, is being gay, has that helped you learn?  Yeah, I mean, of course.  You get in touch with your feminine side, and you can work with that.  You know, you get a little more flair, a little bit more pomp and circumstance.  I'm a real bitch in the morning, though.  Yeah.  So that doesn't help much.  I do miss that little fountain on top of your head.  You like that one, huh?  What did we used to call it when Chris...  I'm not saying it.  When Chris...  I'm not saying it. 
[02:10:00]  You know what we used to say.  Chris has to wear that ponytail right on top of his head.  Say it, come on.  And we would call it the jizz fountain.  I like how so many Opie had some morals and some remorse.  I'm not saying that.  I'm done with that.  It was funny.  It was 10 years ago.  It was funny.  Yeah, it was funny, man.  By the way, Sam, we called it pebbles and stuff.  Yeah, pebbles and stuff.  And hey, hello, that's why I had it.  So that people like you would insult me for it, you idiots.  He was a heel.  By the way, Sam, having the camera...  Just on a close-up of Cheryl's face, not making her uncomfortable at all. 
[02:10:30]  Fucking stalking lunatic.  Oh, believe me.  No, we know...  Sell to TMZ, Jack.  It's always on me.  Believe me.  Believe me, we know Sam.  It's always on the fucking wrestling.  He's a stalker for the WWE guys.  He's crazy.  Even though Chris isn't wrestling right now.  No.  No WrestleMania for you this year.  No, not this year.  Triple H was fucking creeped out by him just, what, yesterday?  The day before?  Two days ago.  It's his eyebrows.  Look at those things.  He's just like, you're everywhere.  He goes, I see you everywhere.  And when a wrestler notices some guy has been everywhere, that's fucking scary. 
[02:11:00]  He's got a couple of Hitler mustaches above his eyes.  It's freaking me out.  Look at those things.  Speewee would be freaked out.  That is fucked up.  Cheryl, as a star of Dancing with the Stars, where did you grow up?  I grew up in San Francisco.  Born and bred?  Yes.  And that's where you began, you obviously began dancing at what, five, six?  Four.  Four years old?  Four years old?  Oh, what a cutie pie.  I miss my daughter.  I would love to have a daughter and take her to little dance classes.  What's cuter than that?  Instead, you got a boy, you take him to the beach, he gets dog shit on him somehow. 
[02:11:30]  Like, how the fuck do you leave this fucking Pacific Ocean with dog shit on you?  Just lucky, I guess.  Just lucky, I guess.  Fuck, they're so stupid.  Boys are dumb.  She had a big-time story.  I don't know what she was.  Do you talk about that shit anymore?  It was in your book.  What story?  The mailman.  What?  Yes.  No, of course I talk about it because it's in my book.  Was he black?  Absolutely.  No.  She was six.  She was six and there was a retired mailman that might have done a thing or two. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  But she's not a victim, which I respect.  Guys are disgusting.  I'm not trying to.  She talks about it, man.  I do talk about it.  Well, the only reason I bring it up is because it was in your book.  Yes.  The mailman delivers.  The thing I wanted to bring up was that the guy got released recently, right?  Yeah, he is released.  He did 20 years.  20 years.  And now he's out.  He's out.  Wow.  Who's looking for him?  You want Billy Hayes to go talk to him?  Billy Hayes will talk to him.  Goddamn.  Where is he?  He's actually stationed, I think, close to where I was.  Stationed?  What do you mean stationed?  Like he's been taken care of because he's about to die. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, so like he's in an old folks home or something?  He's in an old folks home, yeah.  Oh, so they have him in an old folks home.  You should get out of town.  Did he hear it from what happened with you only or it was a cumulative?  Yeah.  You should whisper some shit in his ear that makes him die like fucking some gladiator shit.  Like what?  Like a spell?  At the baby inside of me.  It's not of yours.  Yeah.  The king's fucking just dying there.  You should do that.  Oh my God.  You should do that.  What are you talking about? 
[02:13:00]  It's gladiator.  It's gladiator.  Come on, Chris.  Jay's just like, don't ask him.  He'll just keep going.  Yeah.  He'll just go with it over and over again.  What I like about Cheryl, though, is people in this country, I don't know about the rest  of the world, you have to learn how to turn the fucking page and not be defined by shit  that happened to you.  We all got fucking, had an uncle or a cousin or older kids in the woods and then you did  it to the kids younger than you.  Not me.  You passed it on.  Not me, but other kids like me in New Jersey.  Yeah, you've overcome.  But turn the fucking page.  Don't let it define you. 
[02:13:30]  And on here you have the, you are the biggest star dancer on the show, except for that one  that looks like Mickey Rooney, that fucking blonde guy.  Derek.  Holy shit.  Mickey Rooney.  When is he making his next movie with Judy Garland?  Say, gang, why don't we all get together and do a nice dance?  What about our show?  See?  That'd be a good idea.  And didn't he hook up with, but you are the biggest star on that show.  She is.  Combined, she is.  Distant second is that little, uh, chimpish girl. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, the chimpish girl.  The Mario Lopez girl.  Chimpish girl.  Karina.  Karina, Kara's, yeah, she's like half gibbon.  Oh my God.  Half gibbon.  Cheryl's the real star of the show.  You know why?  Because she rocks the bangs.  It's hard to dance with bangs.  She pulls it off every week.  That's pretty cool.  Is the Russian girl still dancing?  Jeffrey Ross's old partner.  I forgot her name.  No, she's Polish.  She's not dancing anymore.  Why?  What happened?  Pulled a hammy?  Jeffrey Ross.  I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  Jeffrey Ross ruined her?  Yeah, probably.  Jeffrey roasted her.  She used to be a guy to look at.  Let me ask you guys a quick question.  As comedy geniuses.  Ah, yes.  All three of you is.  Of course.  What was the, why would they even ask Situation to do the Trump roast?  Oh, the roast.  Why would they even ask him?  Because it's a big name now and it's popular culture and who cares if he's funny or not.  Just throw him on and let him tank.  But is he in any relation to Trump at all?  No.  No.  Okay, because that was one of the most painful things I've ever seen.  But most of those people don't have a relationship with him.  Oh, all right, all right.  Come on.  Come on now. 
[02:15:00]  I like that was going to fucking work when his jokes didn't go over.  You know, it was kind of a seat.  It's funny you bring that up.  It's kind of a seat.  I've been thinking about this.  It was a bit of a seat change for American audiences.  They weren't saying, we don't think what you're saying is not funny.  Right.  But through his unfunniness, they began to heckle because they realized, what the fuck  are you doing here?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Who is this guy?  That's where the heckles came from.  Exactly.  Because his jokes, like if I said them or you said them, they would have worked.  They wouldn't have been bad.  They would have worked. 
[02:15:30]  You're right.  But then when he hit your last neck or whatever that guy is, you could tell that's the one  he wrote.  He goes, yeah, that's nice.  But I was at my house fucking a model on a bag of money.  In my mansion.  In my mansion.  Really?  Obviously, that's the one you wrote.  And she was laughing.  Yeah.  And it was the fifth one this week.  Oh.  Yeah, it was that uncomfortable silence where people were saying, what the fuck is this  guy even doing up here?  It's a tough hustle, I got booed off stage at the Drew Carey Rose.  Did you? 
[02:16:00]  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I had to go.  I said, Mayor Dinkins and Mayor Abe Beam are here.  They're going to go out back after the show and have a bad mayor off.  And I got booed.  Come on, that's funny.  And Freddie Roman goes, wait, wait, you're out of line.  I go, really?  Out of roast?  You're out of line?  I go, there's a dead hasid in Crown Heights that agrees with me.  Because all the Jews and blacks were fighting.  How is that out of line?  Because they're on their own fryers and Freddie Roman had a couple pops.  And I go, are you talking to me or that fucking rabbit on your head? 
[02:16:30]  And the crowd was like, yo, whoa now.  You can't do that to Freddie.  It's funny, but it's over the line funny maybe.  But, you know, the situation was way past that.  I'm not a big fan of roasts.  Because no one's roast.  They don't roast the ones they love.  They roast the ones that are fucking low enough on the totem pole that they'll agree to be on a roast.  Right.  You never see fucking John Cryer sitting there.  You know why?  Because he's making 1.5 an episode.  Why would he do that, right?  Yeah.  We've got to get these guys out.  They've got to go to Fox.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to waltz. 
[02:17:00]  They're going to waltz on out of here.  Rubber conversation.  Oh, that's a good one.  Cheryl, you have a favorite season.  Obviously, the seasons you win are probably the ones that stand out.  But they may not necessarily be your favorite seasons, correct?  Are there seasons that you didn't win that was just so much damn fun?  I had fun with Jill Marini, the guy that showed us.  The cock.  The cock guy.  Guile Mary.  I'm trying to put this on track for a little adult.  Did he let you see it?  No.  He showed it once.  Why not? 
[02:17:30]  He showed it once.  Show it to the world.  You pick up a bonus when you win?  You pick up a bonus?  We just continue to get paid throughout the whole season.  The more episodes they last, the more money they make.  Oh, I got you.  There's got to be a little cheddar at the end.  If you win.  Nothing.  Endorsements.  Endorsements.  Great.  Yeah, endorsements.  Endorsements.  She's got a lot of endorsements.  What do you do for shampoo and stuff?  Jazzercise is one of them.  Jazzercise.  Full Fast is a diet spray.  Love Full Fast.  I did the whitening strips before.  What's for the hair?  Crest.  Crest is good?  Crest is a big one.  I did Big Sexy Hair. 
[02:18:00]  She's got a lot of them.  She's got dance studios.  She's got dance studios.  See, she's smart.  She's branding herself.  Yeah.  She's going out there in the world and making her fame and fortune.  She's not a Mickey Rooney impersonator like the other one.  Mickey Rooney.  Is there a dancer?  Oh, come on, fucking Roland.  We get it.  They've got to go.  Come on, we understand.  Fuck off.  Jeez.  Where do you guys have to go next?  Fox.  We are for Fox TV.  We're coming back here.  We're everywhere.  I hear you.  You've got to pull them out of your own.  All right.  Get them the hell out of here, then, Roland. 
[02:18:30]  You get the hell out of here.  Now you get the hell out of here.  You're fired here.  Chris Jericho, get your ass out of here.  I don't want to see you again, twinkle toes.  Now get out.  I'll call you later.  See, I set you up there.  I love that.  I fed that to you.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it going on here.  Continued success.  Thank you, guys.  He doesn't miss Vince right now, I bet.  Are you guys going to vote for me on Monday? 
[02:19:00]  Of course.  Yes.  Oh, it's all about everybody.  See, even though you can vote 11 times.  Take it easy.  Nice to meet you.  Let me get a little up there.  All right, Chris.  We'll all vote for you.  Let's get the audience to vote for Chris Jericho.  Are you guys going to do that when I leave, too?  She's a firecracker.  Yeah, we'll check out your ass, Chris.  She's got legs like Earl Campbell.  Jesus.  I turned around and I went, that's not what I was expecting at all.  I'm going to use my Lars Ulrich.  You feel free to use it.  All right.  I'm going to call you.  It's yours.  Chris, thank you.  Yo, Horace Grant, call me.  Thanks, Chris. 
[02:19:30]  Chris Jericho.  Later, man.  Is that Joe Morris from the Giants?  What the fuck happened?  Tiny little Joe Morris from the belly button up.  You go, that's a cute kid.  She's tiny.  And then when she leaves, you go, whoa, some squat thrust.  She probably supplements with the heels.  She wears those heels.  Can I acknowledge that that was the best Lars I've ever heard in my life?  That was Lars Jericho.  I heard he's already getting divorced from his girlfriend, Kelsey Grammer. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, really?  From his girlfriend?  No.  That other one?  That's what I'm just telling you what I heard.  Wow.  I'm only joking.  Oh, April Fool's.  Braveheart, Ant.  Braveheart.  Braveheart.  They can't go on with their lives.  You said Gladiator.  Oh, it was Braveheart.  Braveheart.  All right.  Go fuck your mother.  Why don't we take a break?  More with Jay Moore.  Jay Moore, Foxwoods, week from today.  4-8.  Wait, no.  What's April?  4?  Can I go?  Yeah.  No.  I can't go.  Only if you bring my main man. 
[02:20:30]  Who that?  He likes my son.  That's my homie right there.  We don't talk about my son.  Who that?  Because Ant doesn't like kids.  Well, no, I like kids.  They're funny.  I like that crying kid that wants to be the fucking governor of Jersey.  Your girlfriend told me you don't want kids to get germs on your couch.  No, I hate that.  Boogers.  Specifically.  Booger couch.  Booger couch.  She goes, fucking germs on the couch.  I'm like, all right, we just met.  I go, how are you?  She goes, good.  I go, yeah.  So you're, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She goes, yeah, fucking germs on the couch. 
[02:21:00]  Apropos of nothing.  She just fucking launched into it.  I just launched into the tirade of fucking germs on the couch.  I fucking got off track because I wanted to have some, I just wanted her to stay in  her chair because I tried to make it look like an interview, but I wanted to really  get into fucking Kytel and Burke.  Oh, yeah.  Smoking grass.  Beautiful Girls.  I said Kit Kat.  Kit Kat Club.  I love that.  I watch that movie now and I can't, it's Jay Moore doing that fucking.  It's an incredible movie.  But it's Jay Moore doing the part now.  I can't watch that.  I can't watch Kytel anymore doing anything.  Thank you, Jay.  What kind of businessman are you?  You can't back your own product. 
[02:21:30]  More with Jay Moore.  Foxwoods next Friday.  Yes.  Figure out how to get your own tickets because Jay Moore's not on Twitter to tell you.  Or you should have.  Go to fucking Foxwoods and buy tickets.  Yeah, it's easy.  Let's do that.  Is that your...  Yeah, that's her.  She's laying down there watching you the whole time.  We'll be back, huh?  We'll do it.  Yeah.  The virus.  Virus.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com. 
[02:22:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got an old friend outside the studio, Eddie, uh, Eddie Trunk. 
[02:22:30]  Hey, Eddie, uh, hey, what's that?  I don't do it well, but...  Scott Muni.  Oh, yeah.  Scott says corpse is being wheeled in.  No, it's Eddie Trunk.  What's up, Eddie?  Eddie, how you doing, man?  Are you coming on our show as, like, a legit guest?  It's like a legit guest.  This is weird.  Why are you...  Legitimate guest.  You're a legitimate guest now?  I love the po-gram.  I never considered myself legitimate in any way, but I'm happy to be here.  It's been a long time since I've seen you guys.  I saw Ant on the street.  Last time I saw you on the street, of course, we were right there at the crossroads of the world. 
[02:23:00]  Yes, exactly.  Saying hello.  I saw you at a movie theater.  That was the Batman movie.  I wouldn't know.  You talked to the whole thing.  Oh, shit.  No, I didn't say a word.  All I remember about that is Opie trying to bum money off of me to buy popcorn because he had no cash.  Oh, shit, no.  Did I really?  Yeah, God's honest truth.  You were there.  That's not going to help my image, man.  I thought I was past that.  He was in line with his now wife and going to see Batman, and I'm standing behind him.  He turned around and goes, hey, bro. 
[02:23:30]  He goes, I actually have no cash.  Oh, my God.  This isn't going to help.  What a true friend.  Well, hey, you just said I talked to the movie.  Exactly.  I haven't seen the spin on the show in ages.  I sit down, and the first thing he does is take a shot and talk to a movie.  You know what?  You got me back good.  That one did nail you, I think.  You know, the Jay Moores.  Yeah.  You know, the Jay Moores.  We met very briefly on the NEW days.  I remember when you saw these come in all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Jay came in.  When the girls were getting pierced.  Well, no.  It was crazy.  Jay was going to do one.  Whipple ball bats up their assholes. 
[02:24:00]  Let me tell the audience, because it's been a while.  Jay was going to do one fucking show with us, and then we turned you on to what the possibilities  were all about.  I didn't plan on doing one show.  They just said, here's a new afternoon, new all-time show.  It was just part of your schedule that day.  Yeah.  Little did you know we'd become friends after that one afternoon.  I didn't realize it.  It was awesome, man.  I knew I wanted to.  I think I came back the next day.  Yeah.  You did.  Years.  My first time ever, there was a girl right here in front of me, and she had her labia 
[02:24:30]  pierced.  Pierced.  Great.  And I was like, aren't I in your way?  And he was like, no, you're good.  It's fine.  You're good.  Like the guy did it from an angle.  Because we needed your microphone.  You got fucking ball parked it.  Because just to not interrupt.  I'm like, isn't it measure once, cut?  Isn't it measure twice, cut once?  Fuck, guys.  That's all right.  I was on with Ron and Fez yesterday, and we were talking about the old days.  I said, maybe the days when they would come in annihilated out of their mind when I was  doing my metal show overnight, and Ronnie couldn't even navigate the hallway, and then 
[02:25:00]  there would be a chick.  They'd lay out on the console in the middle of me doing my show on the other side of the  console.  Just lay out a chick, and she'd start taking clothes off, and I'm like, well, here's some  more ACDC, and it's just going on right in front of me.  There were those Fridays where we would do the afternoon.  Yeah.  We'd just be drinking the whole show.  From three to seven.  And then seven o'clock, I'd be like, well, why the fuck would I want to go home?  You know?  So I'd hang out and do Ron and Fez, do their show.  Oh, you were there a lot. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  And still drinking.  And then Eddie'd come in, and it's like, nah, I'll hang around for Eddie Trunk's show.  I'd hang around for three fucking shows back then.  The best part, your girl at the time taking the knife to the console saying, uh, uh,  Carvin and I love Anthony.  Oh, who was that?  The fucking, uh...  I'm just saying the girl.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was she in?  The T-Birds?  But she had a knife, and she just fucking carved it into the console.  AnyW was so fucking livid over the way.  My favorite quick...  That thing is still there, I'm sure.  My favorite quick AnyW story about my show is that when all you guys would hang out and 
[02:26:00]  everything, there would be like, you know, reminances of whatever show.  Yeah, yeah.  There would be carryovers.  Yeah, it would be like 12, 12.30, I'd be on the air, and I'll never forget, I had a  bunch of guests, I forget who in the studio, I'm playing the music really loud during the  music, and all of a sudden the door creaks open, and it was Stalker Patty, and she pops  her head into the studio, and she goes, can you keep it down?  I'm trying to sleep out here.  And she was sleeping under the stairs.  And she was mad that my show was too loud.  You were doing a show? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, she was sleeping under the stairs.  She lived there for probably a month before they decided, all right, you can't have a  fucking Stalker living under the stairs.  I always liked Stalker Patty, and I always, because I had a peripheral relationship with  her, she didn't actually stalk me, but she always just seemed like a nice lady that was  down on her luck that was, you know...  She was a stalker.  Can you spare a dime for a fellow American who's down on his luck?  Talk very slowly.  She would meet me on the subway platform because she was going the same...  Yeah, I went to this. 
[02:27:00]  It would be.  I liked her more than fucking Princess Doc, the retarded living under Shirley.  I love those, too.  They stunk.  I love those, too.  There was a period where that station had zero management, and remember that?  There was like, for like three, four months, and the lunatics were literally running the  asylum.  It was great.  There was never greater radio in my life.  We fucking...  We went on that once.  Ron and Fez were on vacation, and they were playing a bit, and you know how even when the  show's on vacation, people will call in thinking somebody is there a lot?  So we would sit there, and out...  The screener used to be out in the, like, green room lobby area where the foosball table 
[02:27:30]  was and everything.  So we'd take the calls and go, all right, what do you got for Ron and Fez?  Hold on.  And we'd each take line one, line two, line three, and we'd bet a hundred bucks, and  we'd sit there and see who hung up last out of the people that were on the phone.  And, dude, it went for hours.  It was fun.  Drinking, playing foosball.  It's like, oh, fucking line two just hung up.  Shit!  Motherfucker!  Another one just came to me with you.  Exactly.  This is hysterical.  I was on the air New Year's Eve, all right? 
[02:28:00]  And you came in with a bunch of people because I was on sweeping past midnight.  So you came in, and you were just hanging out.  You wanted to go up to the top to see the ball drop.  So Anthony says to me, he goes, I'm going to bring my cell phone, he goes, and we'll  do a countdown thing, report from the roof.  And I'm like, all right, so Ann's up there on the thing, and he goes, I got him live on  the air, and he's like doing the thing.  He goes, all right, Eddie, here we go.  It's three, two, all right, Happy New Year.  We have this big thing on the air, and then the lines just go crazy.  I'm like, what the fuck just happened?  We realized we're on like a 36-second delay. 
[02:28:30]  That's when we did our countdown into nothing.  It was, everybody's already Happy New Year-ing.  And I'm like, 15, 14, and Ann comes down the elevator, and he walks in.  How was it?  I go, well, it was about 40 seconds late.  Remember, you could get to the roof, though?  Yeah.  And just hang out?  Yeah.  We used to go up to that roof on, yeah, we used to go up there on New Year's Eve.  Fuck yeah, the view from up there was ridiculous.  I never went up.  Looked right down into Times Square. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, man, it was cool.  It was too scary in a city now.  So the snipers would fucking zero in on you after 9-11.  And what about the stairwell with the pot happening?  Oh, yeah?  Oh, Stinky's Club Stinky.  Leave me out of this.  Club Stinky, where we used to go in the stairwell and smoke the weed.  People used to come in, guess, smoke the weed.  Rodney Dangerfield.  The best was Rodney.  Rodney went into the stairwell.  Rodney went into the stairwell.  A joint down there.  Wait, how about the windows when you could see the people showering?  Oh, yeah.  That was every afternoon.  Scotso almost jumped out of his...  I ran Scotso's board one day. 
[02:29:30]  His head almost exploded.  Well, we turned everyone on to that.  We finally did.  Those dummies wouldn't look out the stupid window.  I'm like, if you look out, you might see some girls showering.  And then the people that did our show started signing the stairwell.  Yeah, we had a big autograph.  Oh, yeah.  The walls.  They stole that here, by the way.  They do it now here.  They sign the walls.  Yeah.  So, Eddie, we should get a couple plugs out for the book, because we got this book about...  This book's awesome.  I know.  It's great, man.  We got the book a month ago.  Eddie Trunk in studio.  And you took it very seriously.  I mean, this thing is put together real well. 
[02:30:00]  Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, forwarded by Rob Halford.  Yeah.  May I ask a question before we get into that?  How, to me, this seems like a logistical nightmare as far as clearing all these photos and  these people.  Oh, there's a story behind that, because you're right.  It is.  Is the story in the book?  No, I'll tell you what happened with the photos.  It is a nightmare to clear photos, and those photos are incredible.  And they were all taken...  99% of the shots in the book were taken by the same guy, a guy by the name of Ron Akiyama.  He's a friend of mine.  He's been following me around and following these bands around for almost 35 years. 
[02:30:30]  And he took all these shots.  So, one guy did it.  And the cool thing about it is, because since he's a friend of mine, the stories that I'm  talking about in the book, a lot of the shots are exactly from that show, because  he was with me at the show.  And how he got that access, because he was not a legit photographer, how he got the access  was that he worked in a record store that had a Ticketron, or Ticketmaster, and 9 o'clock  in the morning, tickets would go on sale for Van Halen, and he would open the door at 9.01 
[02:31:00]  to the people in line, and in that 60 seconds, punch out the front row.  And then he'd sneak his camera in, and then go take those shots.  So, a lot of the shots of the bands of the 70s were taken without any photo credential  at all.  So, he took this picture of Ozzy from the Black Sabbath days, the early days?  I think you missed a really good forward.  These are amazing.  This would have been a great forward to the book.  Is it in the book?  Yeah, we talk about it.  Yeah, I think we talk about all that stuff in the book.  You think?  It's your book. 
[02:31:30]  I wrote it two years ago.  You fucking stutter and prick you?  Sharon gave approval for the...  No.  Okay.  Sharon hates me, but that's another story.  I don't know.  I mean, because...  I don't know.  I wish I knew.  You really think she hates you?  Yeah, well, she won't let Ozzy do our TV show.  Wait a minute.  We've asked every season.  Eddie Trump's essential hard rock and heavy metal, but yet Sammy Hagar is in it.  Mm-hmm.  You don't see a dichotomy there?  No.  You think Sammy Hagar is essential to rock and roll?  Did you ever hear Montrose? 
[02:32:00]  Or one through three lockbox?  Did you ever hear Montrose?  No, I don't know.  Montrose first two albums are one of the two of the most...  First album with the most influential records in hard rock.  Come on.  Shaped Van Halen, Shaped Iron Maiden, everything.  Hey, whoa, watch the Maiden now.  Watch the Maiden.  Maiden covered two Montrose songs.  What's the big Montrose song?  Rock Candy, Rock the Nation, Bad Motor Scooter.  They never had a hit, but those were...  It's an enormously influential record.  Oh, he just told you, Jay Morris.  No, that's what I love.  And he was a singer in Van Halen. 
[02:32:30]  He said he's putting everyone down.  He's got the comebacks.  No, I like it.  He's calling me cheap and then telling you you don't have Sammy Hagar knowledge.  No, I like that.  I'm setting him up to...  You don't know the Red Rockers.  I'm setting him up to defend his wares.  Well, listen, if you don't...  What do you think of Sammy Hagar and the Alien thing that came out recently?  It doesn't bother me.  The guy was probably stoned and whatever.  Exactly.  He smokes pot and drinks tequila.  What do you think he's going to say?  I mean, that didn't even faze me.  I thought it was more interesting about all the Van Halen stuff and how whacked out and out of their minds Eddie and Alex were. 
[02:33:00]  I love when he calls Eddie, whenever he put Eddie's hair up in the thing, the samurai hair on the reunion tour that he was out of his mind.  And I went to those shows and it's true.  I didn't...  You couldn't tell what Eddie Van Halen was playing.  He was playing a different song than the rest of the band.  Really?  It was god awful.  Yeah.  Unbelievably bad.  Is he still drinking a lot?  No, this was the reunion with Hagar, which was what?  90...  Whatever it was.  I don't know how he is now.  I don't know.  So why the fuck was he so off?  Oh, then he was whacked out of his head. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know how.  Did they do a tour with David Lee also?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Because I've always been saying, like, they're the band that left the most money on the table.  A couple years ago, they did.  At the time, yeah.  But David Lee, like, his bus always breaks down just outside of town.  Like, he's like, oh, Dave can't make it.  The humidifier's busted.  Like, literally, like, the most petty...  Go find Gary Cerrone!  The most petty shittin' that you heard all this, right?  Yeah, well, after reading Sammy's book, I said to Gary, I said, you have a better chance  of getting a reunion with Van Halen than he does right now. 
[02:34:00]  Oof.  You know?  That goes down as a weird part in the Van Halen history.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, not quite a high point.  No.  What I like about the book, you do Eddie's playlist and one of my band, Zeppelin.  You basically do your favorite Zeppelin songs.  Is this how this works, right?  Well, yeah.  I mean, it got edited down a lot.  What page are you on?  What I think are my favorite songs, yeah.  I'm trying to think what should be on this list.  Oh, tons.  But I had to cut everything.  I had to cut...  That's...  I didn't realize that process in books, is that the editing thing, it's like, well, you 
[02:34:30]  can only pick so many songs that fit in that little circle that that spot is.  So I had double the amount of songs that had to be trimmed up.  And you had to cut all the Willie Dixon songs.  Yeah, exactly.  See, I know what's up.  Yeah, you do.  But to Jay's point about the different sorts of bands in there, anybody that's followed  me in whatever I've done in almost 30 years in radio and TV knows that I've always separated  hard rock and heavy metal.  I think they're two different genres.  And if you look in my book, you're going to see Slayer and Megadeth and Metallica.  You're also going to see Bon Jovi, Poison, and Billy Squire. 
[02:35:00]  I think that there are importances to both of those genres of music.  The book just looks good.  Eddie nailed his playlist, by the way.  The Zeppelin playlist, yeah, he nailed it.  What's in there?  I don't even remember what I put.  The only one I would have, I would have taken out, um, hot dog.  Yeah.  I didn't put hot dog in there, O.  I know I didn't put hot dog.  I was going to go, yeah, you might want to lose that.  And O.P.  I bailed on it.  I didn't bail on it. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, maybe he wasn't saying that.  Maybe he just needed to lend him some money so he could buy one.  I don't know what I take.  Bring it up again.  Yeah, I have to.  What's the hit from Into the Outdoor?  Fuck it.  Let all the love that I've found.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Fool in the Rain.  Fool in the Rain.  Fool in the Rain.  But I like In the Evening better from that album.  In the Evening's a great song.  A great guitar solo.  Fool in the Rain's got, it's like four different songs.  It's very Lennon McCartney-esque.  It's three different songs, right?  Yeah.  It has a whistle.  Eddie, what's the, uh, what's your second most, like, passion in life? 
[02:36:00]  Obviously, heavy metal and hard rock music is number one.  That's like you, when you, when you bump into Eddie, you talk fucking music and shit.  What's your second favorite thing?  Probably football and the Giants.  Yeah.  Probably NFL.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Fucking Giants.  Fucking Giants.  What a zilch.  Jesus.  Sorry I asked.  Boring fucking team.  Is Jane's Addiction in here?  Why not Jane's Addiction in here?  We're bad friends.  That's Jane's Addiction.  Jay's band is, uh.  No, we don't go into the 90s or even, yeah, it's, it's, it's, look, it's, it's, it's 
[02:36:30]  a niche, if you will.  It's, it's my world of what's important to me as a kid growing up.  Are you selling a lot of these?  You, you know what, man?  You have to be.  I gotta tell you, um, the official release date is today, but it's actually been out for  about a week in most places, and, uh, it's kind of taken everyone by surprise because  it's doing a hell of a lot better than, let me, let me tell you something.  There's so many fans of this.  Let me help you sell this fucking thing.  Bon Jovi has more fucking good songs.  There's an average of, there's an average of, there's an average of two pictures per page in this  fucking book.  That's, that's definitely your audience, but it's not a picture book either.  That's your audience, so, lots of pictures, Long Island. 
[02:37:00]  Who the fuck wants to read a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures in it, Jay Morris?  I don't know, mine's stupid.  Oh.  I like your book.  It's a great book.  Yeah, why didn't you have pictures in your book, Jay?  Uh, cause I don't want to have pictures of my kid on, you know, to.  Yeah, but what about you as a kid?  Aw.  There was very little of me in it.  You know I liked your book.  I wrote, I know, I don't give a shit.  I kept, I kept texting you as I'm reading the fucking thing.  I don't give a shit.  Fuck do I care?  Where's the Van Halen page?  Just go, go to the back and talk about it.  Oh, I know, it's about it, about it.  Sorry, Eddie Trunk.  I didn't realize that.  Nice.  There you go. 
[02:37:30]  I want to see the Van Halen.  Look at Diamond.  Dave, you fucking, get your shit together, Dave.  How about this shot with Eddie with the bra on the mic stand, man?  Look at this shot, Jay.  That's a great shot.  Look at that.  That's, he got some pussy.  What's that set?  You know he's playing, I guarantee he's playing Panama right there.  How do you know?  That's his face.  No, that's pre-1984, though.  Just agree with me, dummy.  It can't, it can't be.  Look at the caption, what year is it from?  All right.  Wow.  Eddie, your Van Halen playlist, very obscure, I noticed.  Yeah, I'm not.  Very obscure.  I'm not down with the hits.  Holy shit.  Where the fuck is Unchained? 
[02:38:00]  I've been on radio 30 years, I've never played a hit.  How about Unchained is right.  Unchained?  Why not?  Well, you're out of your fucking mind.  Listen, when you get to Van Halen, what, you really should.  You put Pound Cake in there.  Pound Cake.  That's what I love, Pound Cake.  But you know what?  When you get to Van Halen, it really should be about what songs you leave off, because there's  so many great ones.  How do you do that?  Well, how about you put one of the great ones on?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, shit.  Atomic Punk.  I swear to God, I kind of know music.  I don't know half these Van Halen songs.  I know.  Come on.  Unchained. 
[02:38:30]  If you're a hard rock fan, there's no way you don't love anything from Van Halen.  Somebody give me a doctor or like.  Like.  Like.  Everybody wants some.  I like you, Donnie.  Like.  Everybody wants some.  Where's Everybody Wants Some?  It's not on the list, Jay.  That's a good song.  It's a good song.  It's a great song.  Where's A talking about love?  It's a great song.  It's like you're being interrogated.  What are you fucking deeper tracks?  Yeah.  What me and Jay Moores are getting at is he's trying to be too cool for the room in his Van  Halen playlist.  No, it's not.  Too cool for the room.  I like the other stuff, man. 
[02:39:00]  Is Romeo Delight on there?  That's a great song.  I don't know that song.  They used to open with that song.  Never heard of it.  Never heard of it, sir.  Never heard of it.  Pass.  It's on Women and Children.  They used to open with it.  Pass.  I never heard of it.  Pass.  Punch it up.  Let me hear that.  Romeo Delight.  First, let's do Unchained, and then we'll play everything else.  Yeah, let's get the fucking...  You really fucking out-cooled your...  What are you, a Weezer?  They're not in the book, Jay.  I know.  Out-cooled yourself.  Jesus Christ.  Eddie, just jokes.  You're going to sell a shitload of copies.  What I love about...  It's all good.  Here's the thing about Iron Maiden, too. 
[02:39:30]  My favorite band in the whole book, probably...  Iron Maiden.  Yeah, definitely.  But it's the only band where the bassist writes music and lyrics, Steve Harris.  Yeah, he wrote...  Super strange dynamic.  Yeah, and actually, Maiden is playing...  Can I just hit some signings real quick?  Yes!  Because I'm doing a book signing right before...  No, I'm doing a...  April 8th, right?  Right before...  Play along, stupid.  I'm doing a book signing right before an Iron Maiden concert.  They're only doing two shows in America, and one is on the 16th of April in Fort Lauderdale.  And at the arena, right next door, there's a mall, Sawgrass Mills Mall. 
[02:40:00]  There's a bookstore in there, Books A Million.  So I'll be signing in there, like, a few hours before Maiden plays across the street.  Cool.  And then tonight is the first signing in the launch party at the Hard Rock.  It's open, everyone, starting at 7.  Tuesday, Mendham Books.  Mendham, New Jersey, at 4.  Wednesday, what is this?  Bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey, Wednesday, at 7.  And then Thursday at the Book Review in Huntington, all at 7 o'clock.  Ooh, Huntington, Book Review.  That's right down the street from FH Reilly's. 
[02:40:30]  FH Reilly's.  You want a free meal?  Yeah, sure.  I'm not even kidding.  I'll never turn that down.  When is it?  Book Review is Thursday.  Next Thursday.  You're a fucking tool.  Hope he's a fucking tool.  Hope he says, I'm not even kidding.  Like, you offered him a fucking moon.  You offered him a fucking skirt steak and a beer.  You want a free meal?  Sure.  No, hey, I'm not even kidding.  You want some mac and cheese?  This is your fucking shot, Eddie Trump.  Look at me.  I've never been wanting to turn down a free meal.  You want some mac and cheese?  I hope he's not kidding about it.  I'm not kidding about it. 
[02:41:00]  He really will.  Fuck you, Jay Morris.  I'll hit you.  I'll hit you up, both.  And the last one Saturday, a week from tomorrow, the 9th at Vintage Final.  I'll watch him have to pay me in.  Ford's New Jersey, 4 p.m.  Please, Brad, if you're listening.  Hard rock tonight.  Hold on.  If Eddie Trump comes by FH next Thursday, please do the right thing.  Thanks, sir.  You're a Guns N' Roses guy, Jay Morris.  Is this the 80s?  Do the right thing?  Do the right thing?  Why not Mr. Brownstone on your Guns N' Roses playlist?  Played out.  Tired of it.  Fuck, man.  I hate, listen, I'll admit this. 
[02:41:30]  I hate the songs that you hear all the time.  I know.  I've done the music thing on the radio way too long, too.  Eddie toiled over these lists.  Toiled.  It doesn't look like it.  I can't stand here in...  That's why I don't go see the Stones anymore.  I do not want to pay money to see you do fucking Brown Sugar or Honky Tonk Woman.  I saw the Stones at the Hollywood Bowl, which I think seats like 8,000 people, and you go,  this is a very bizarre...  This was two years ago.  This was a super bizarre show, like the Stones at the Hollywood Bowl.  They haven't played here since... 
[02:42:00]  Got live if you want it, right?  That's not where it's recording, the time I'm saying.  And I go, oh my God, this could be one of those shows where they just go up and do  Exile on Main Street, start to finish.  No, just fucking...  All the hits.  Start me off, Honky Tonk Woman, miss you.  Then they threw in all down the line, but I was like, you guys fucking suck.  You didn't want to see that?  If I could turn on my fucking radio and hear that shit.  But see, you lose...  What about Moonlight Mile?  Because you know you lose so much audience.  90% of people want to hear that. 
[02:42:30]  It's the Hollywood Bowl.  Everyone there is there because they're very fancy people.  Anthony, you're hipsters.  I want to hear Moonlight Mile and Sway.  Did you like the Scorsese movie?  No, it was horrible.  Okay.  Did you?  I didn't see it.  I thought it was well done.  I mean, I liked what I saw.  Of course, it's well done.  And the set list is pretty diverse in that, I thought.  The other Stones movie was amazing.  Selling a heavy metal book.  We're talking about the Stones.  Yes, I know.  Don't worry.  Fuck.  We sold your copies.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal.  Forward by Rob Halford. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Ha ha ha.  A band's starting to play complete albums now.  We've got to hear these songs, though.  That's kind of a cool thing.  What do you want?  I want to hear Unchained and then Romeo's Delight.  Yeah, and show how fucking ridiculous your choice was.  All right.  Put it on.  There's, look.  Eddie Van Halen's on your phone right now.  It's actually Jericho.  It's Jericho?  Yeah.  Here, answer it.  It's he already.  Oh, it's a text.  I just left and something.  How long will you be at Sirius? 
[02:43:30]  I'll be back there at 1030.  What's going on with you guys?  Oh, what's up?  I don't know.  Jericho has a blurb on the back of my book.  A couple of beautiful girls.  Yeah, Chris is into it, obviously.  Chris is, oh, me and Chris are, yeah, we're like psychotic with this stuff.  Cheryl Burke on your way out?  What's that?  Sorry, I'm mouthful of food.  Did you see Cheryl Burke on the way out?  No.  Oh, she's a dancer.  I know.  Can we do Romeo's Delight?  You want an appetizer or the entree?  Yeah, let's do Romeo's Delight.  Appetizer.  This is on Eddie Trunk's all-time Van Halen playlist.  Go ahead.  I have no problem with this. 
[02:44:00]  We're calling this the appetizer.  Go ahead.  Not all at once.  I don't have an over here.  I got unchained if you want to do that first.  Oh, you don't have Romeo's Delight?  No.  Oh, E-Rock.  What else do you have from his list?  No, no, no.  Danny's got it.  Here we go.  Romeo's Delight.  No, he's right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I didn't realize it was this.  Yeah.  Listen to that.  Ah, that's right.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Listen to the beat switch.  Remember, remember. 
[02:44:30]  One, two, three.  I love how the band has to slow down for David Lee Roth's vocals every time.  What the fuck is that about?  He'll talk his way through a song.  He just slows everything down.  Look.  Look.  You're done, Dave.  You're going to rock again?  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  High five, Daddy Trunk.  You know what?  I got it.  I don't know that song.  Quick story about that song. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  Van Halen opened with that song at the Us Festival.  It's legendary.  If you've ever seen the bootlegs of the video.  Legendary.  They open with that song, and the song starts where the vocal comes in, and Roth just opens  his mouth, and nothing comes out.  And he starts going, literally, in front of 100,000 people.  And they get to the chorus, and he just yells to the crowd, I forgot the fucking words, man!  And that's all he says.  Exactly.  And the crowd's just like, wah! 
[02:45:30]  It doesn't matter.  He never sings the lyrics.  Play Little Dreamer.  That's a great song.  That does not belong here.  That's a great song, man.  Look, I'm not going to get on you about fucking Poundcake.  That's a good one.  You're getting off easy.  Fucking Poundcake.  Wasn't that written by Firehouse?  No.  Firehouse!  Is this on my list, Jay?  No.  Little Dreamer is.  It is.  It was on it?  That's all right, though.  Yeah, but this isn't the all right list. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, this is like the motherfucker list.  This is too, this is very too self-conscious.  This is Dave, man, Dave.  I used to fucking love this song.  Yeah.  This is the more laid-back groove.  This was the more laid-back groove, you know?  Yeah.  That's all you need to know.  Anthony driving around Long Island in his fucking Guinea Camaro.  No, this was horrible.  I love how Anthony showed respect to Eddie Trunk by putting his coat on and he's got 
[02:46:30]  his backpack on his shoulder.  I am fucking out of here, motherfucker.  I'm playing Anthony out.  Now, this is what should have been on your list.  This is on my list, you said.  No, Unchained.  Yeah, you should have had Unchained.  What the fuck do you leave out Unchained?  I don't dislike any of it.  It's just what you gotta do.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop the music.  Stop the music.  There's really no reason to play this song, ladies and gentlemen.  Radio, radio.  No.  Just fucking show that fucking shit to respect, because we were all talking over it. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, this is a good one.  That's all right.  Boo!  Oh, shit.  Listen to that fucking buzz song.  Hey, Eddie Trunk, good luck with the book.  I leave you in the capable hands of a great LPUs.  See you in another ten years, Ant.  Yeah, all right.  Maybe I'm the same book.  Do you leave this on your pound cake?  It's on vacation, everybody.  It's a great song, man.  Have a good time.  You're calling from the satellite phone?  I'm going to call from the sat phone, from the deck of the wonderful epic, and I'm going 
[02:47:30]  to be videotaping stuff, uploading.  It's going to be like a vacation memory.  Leave, Anthony.  It's going to be great.  Are you going to do it live from the compound from the water?  Yes, it's going to be live from the fucking compound from the water.  You should do that.  I will.  All right, we'll see you soon.  We'll be holding down the fort next week.  A bridge before the bridge.  Attempting, anyway.  All right.  Pay this out.  Eddie, one more thing.  Rush.  Say this, Danny. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Why aren't they in the fucking rock and roll?  Oh, God.  Don't even start.  You've got to go.  No, I'll be right back.  Opie's like, you're leaving me here with him?  No, I don't care.  I like you, Eddie.  You know that.  I know, I know.  I'm busting balls.  I know.  Eddie's got to go?  You're a big star.  You've got to go?  There's another show here that I know they want me to go on, but I was told you have  to end at 930 today.  No, we had to leave it, but we didn't have to.  I would love to stay.  Can we still stay?  I want to at least ask you about Rush.  Why aren't they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in your humble opinion?  What show does he have to do? 
[02:48:30]  Are we fucking someone up?  Yeah, because someone else has a live show that they have to do as well.  Who?  Broad something?  Broad-minded.  Broad.  Don't worry about that.  So, Rush.  Danny, you gave me the message.  That's fine.  Danny's not in trouble.  Say again?  Rush.  Rush, why are they not in the Hall of Fame?  Because it's an ill...  Oh, Rush is just one of how many bands...  Can you imagine how many bands are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that should?  People don't even realize it.  Yeah, but when people talk about bands that should be in the Hall of Fame, at the top of  that list...  Rush and Kiss.  ...in a lot of cases are Rush and Kiss. 
[02:49:00]  You're right.  And the other thing that's insane is that Alice Cooper, who just went in, waited 15 years.  They ignored him for 15 years.  Whether you like his music or not, he invented a genre.  They snubbed...  Van Halen, who we just played, they waited six, seven years.  How do they not go in the first time eligible?  Of course.  It's a joke.  I've railed about it on TV and radio for years.  I'll continue to do it.  And I don't do it for shock factor or anything.  I do it because most people don't know these people aren't in. 
[02:49:30]  That's what Alice said in all the press he did for the Hall just now.  They all said...  Alice did all this press.  He goes, what's amazing is everyone's saying, we thought you were in already.  Nobody knows.  Nobody follows that shit that closely.  What about Sabbath?  Sabbath.  Sabbath.  No, we're doing Rush.  You a Rush fan?  No, I was just imitating Jimmy.  Oh.  Yeah, it's always about Sabbath.  Where are you with Rush?  I love Rush.  Yeah, why aren't they in the right Hall of Fame?  Please.  Do they care that they're not in it?  Why isn't Kiss and the Hall of Fame?  I think that all these guys say that they roll it off their back, but as soon as they get 
[02:50:00]  the green light, they go running and they go right into it.  They love it.  I mean, you know, they want to be in it, of course, but you can't, when you're being  snubbed, you can't be like, I really want to be in it.  But how do you deny songs like YYZ, 2112?  It's a joke.  And of course, I know me and you played the song probably a thousand times each on our  shows.  Tom Sawyer, Live Live.  Spirit of Radio.  Spirit of Radio.  Come on.  That shit still is great when you hear it.  Come on.  I'm not sick of those three songs.  Thin Lizzy might be the most underrated person in this book.  Thin Lizzy? 
[02:50:30]  Person?  Well, you know, Pink Floyd might be the best guy.  The best guy ever.  By the way, which one is Pink?  I would say Sid.  They are so fucking...  I don't know.  Does Pink Floyd make your book?  Did Phil and I just fucking vanish?  No, because they're not really...  They're not a hard rock level man.  Phil died almost 20 years ago.  I don't know anything about that.  O.D.?  Yeah, he had a lot of heroin.  He had a lot of problems.  But you know what?  There's a new lineup of Thin Lizzy, and obviously it'll never be Thin Lizzy without Phil, but  Vivian Campbell's in it, and it's really good. 
[02:51:00]  I just saw them a couple weeks...  Last week, they were amazing.  Songs are amazing.  They stand the test of time.  They're amazing.  Unfortunately, in the case of Thin Lizzy, they're one of those bands that are known in America  for one song, Boys Are Back in Town.  But in Europe, they've got like 20 hits.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit jailbreak, yeah.  But not to the degree of Boys Are Back in Town.  But Bon Scott, like, talk about doing a cover and taking it to the next level.  Thunder!  Yeah!  You mean Brian Johnson?  Wasn't that Bon Scott, jailbreak?  Oh, I thought...  Never mind.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:51:30]  We're talking about two or three things.  Yeah, no.  He made it out!  Yeah.  Great stuff.  You got ACDC in here?  Of course.  Let's look at his playlist.  If you don't have Thunderstruck on this list, then I probably don't.  Thunderstruck is terrible.  Thunderstruck's played out.  You don't like Thunderstruck?  No, it's cheesy.  Yeah, it's great when I'm at a fucking Islanders game.  It's not great when I'm listening to an album.  You know, how many songs have been ruined by sports stadiums now, playing the same...  I can never hear Crazy Train as long as I live.  Every sports stadium...  No Thunderstruck figures.  Why does every sports stadium have to play Crazy Train and Welcome to the Jungle? 
[02:52:00]  Why?  Because it's fun.  That was my first ever show in my life right there, Jay.  Kiss at the Garden.  First album I ever bought, Kiss Love Gun.  Kiss at the Garden.  Look at that.  PLJ Presents.  That was the day.  77.  What page?  What page, Jay?  107.  107.  I gotta tell you, your Kiss playlist is really...  Lame?  Well, I don't know enough of these songs.  Opie with the glass half full mentality.  I love that.  You know my mentality is at a truck?  You got too much glass.  In all fairness, I grew up liking Kiss. 
[02:52:30]  I haven't liked them in a few decades.  Oh, I can't look at Kiss now.  Gene Simmons makes me laugh.  Sorry for the half glass on that one, but that was justified.  No, you're right.  I'm not a big Kiss fan.  The last few years of Kiss have just been not good.  No, why?  Because he's just a dick.  But not only that...  Gene Simmons is just a dick.  Not only that, it's just...  You've got a band that they've got two guys being impersonating the other guys.  And that, to me, is the line that as big of a fan as I was was crossed.  I found the biggest problem in the book, and it's Iron Maiden. 
[02:53:00]  You don't have Number the Beast or Run to the Hills.  Run to the Hills, come on.  Yeah, but they're just...  You're thinking...  What do you mean...  It's just...  Come on.  What page is that?  It's played out.  You're trying to turn people on to songs that should be bigger.  But it's not...  Those aren't my favorite songs.  They're not...  It's just...  Run to...  Run to...  Run for the Hills?  No, it's not.  There's so much better stuff on Number the Beast.  Let him who hath understanding.  We got Club Soda Kenny checking in.  Hey, guys. 
[02:53:30]  Kenny.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I'm sorry to interrupt Eddie Trunk.  Then why'd you do it?  I wish you all the best.  That means there's no sorry there.  Sorry.  Yeah, the book's doing well.  But I just...  Could you guys just please remind all your listeners that the Antisocial Network on sale is at 10 o'clock for DC, Ticketmaster.com. 
[02:54:00]  And the pre-sales for Chicago, too, starts today.  Why don't we get Jimmy for this?  Why do we get the club?  Where's Jimmy?  You know how he is.  Yeah.  But I just...  You know, I missed you guys anyway.  What is that show, the Antisocial show?  That was David Tell, Bill Burge, and Brewer, and Lil' Jimmy.  That's a crazy-ass lineup.  How do they split the fucking dough on that?  I don't know.  How do they, Kenny?  They arm wrestle. 
[02:54:30]  No, is it favorite?  Obviously, it's favorite nations, but you can only make so much if it's like...  How much are tickets for that?  Oh, they're very reasonable.  Oh, my God.  You talk like Stalker Patty.  Well, I don't know.  She might be smarter than me.  How much are tickets for that?  I don't know how much the tickets are.  I don't have to buy them.  But I could go on Ticketmaster.com.  I'm sure they're very reasonable.  All right.  Tickets go on sale at 10. 
[02:55:00]  10 o'clock.  Thank you for allowing me to plug that.  Where's Jimmy?  And have a nice weekend.  And Anthony, have a nice weekend.  He's gone.  Thank you, sir.  It was 10 minutes ago.  Where's Jimmy?  All right.  Jimmy, you know...  Just say he's sleeping.  Just say it.  Right.  He's...  We have separate rooms.  I don't know where he's going.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  And he leaves you in the middle of tomorrow, wake up and do this for me?  What?  Wait, what?  Did Jimmy say, wake up and do this for me? 
[02:55:30]  That's what Jay said, I think.  Jay left.  Jay's gone.  No, I just, you know, I'm conscientious.  So I...  You know, because it's three hours earlier here, so...  All right.  Eddie Trunk's book is the essential hard rock and heavy metal.  Tickets go set on sale at 10.  Thank you.  I'll tell you one thing.  It's a book that certainly stirs up...  I mean, we're...  Discussion.  We could sit here for two hours.  Can we go Def Leppard for a sec?  I'm still not off Unchained.  How the fuck did you... 
[02:56:00]  I mean, play it again.  It's not only just about the songs I picked, though.  I know, but that sounds on all the songs on this record.  I'm in the wrestling room at Verona High School fucking people up right here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Splits.  All right.  Could you add a chapter to the book for Jay Moore?  And by the way, I'm going to add an amendment for Jay Moore.  Keep it.  Alex Van Halen.  Charlie Watts tight right here.  Super tight.  He's a great drummer.  So underrated.  But in this song, he crushes it. 
[02:56:30]  Are you having...  It's a great song.  But my point is that...  Pound Cake's a great song.  All right, go Pound Cake now.  All right, Pound Cake.  We don't have it.  Eddie, you might have to admit you messed up on this one.  Leave this, leave this.  Go to the chorus.  Oh, my God.  This makes me so happy.  Stop, rocker.  Go to dinner.  Down, down.  I'm going to go fucking hit somebody in the throat. 
[02:57:00]  All right, let's go Pound Cake now.  Pound Cake.  Because this is what Eddie decided and said unchanged.  And that's also slow and deliberate what you and Anthony were talking about.  It's the same type of groove.  Two, one, two.  Who's got it?  Here's Pound Cake, Jay.  Eddie's going to admit he's wrong by the end of this interview.  This is Pound Cake.  That's the fucking gayest shit I've ever heard of.  Yes. 
[02:57:30]  All right, I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.  You got me wrong.  Who's my cherry pie?  I'm wrong.  Let this play.  Guilty as charged, Jay Moore.  Guilty as charged.  And this was a radio hit, Eddie.  It's a great song.  I don't like radio hits.  That's why I left off Number of the Beast.  They play it constantly.  No, it's not only, that's not the only criteria for me.  You have an Iron Maiden playlist without Number of the Beast or Run to the Hills.  Number of the Beast isn't on there?  No.  I guess I don't know.  I'm doing it two years ago, Jay. 
[02:58:00]  It takes a long time to get this thing out.  This is garbage.  Garbage.  There's pedals for his voice.  Hope's not feeling either.  I'm not feeling this one.  Unchained now.  I'll be honest with you.  I played it a million times on the radio.  Back to Unchained.  Go Unchained.  Listen to that.  And right before the chorus when it goes down, down, down, down.  Hold on one second.  I've got to see.  I'll be right back.  They're pissed at you.  It was my fault, Eddie Trunks. 
[02:58:30]  What happened?  I told him not to go to his next interview.  Can you turn this up in my head?  Oh, I got my head.  I hope you're still on when I come back from this.  But if you're not, thank you.  Were you going to the shade?  I don't know.  No, Eddie, we're not going to be.  So what's the big plug?  Get the book signings out of the way.  All right, so Eddie Trunks, Essential, Hard Rock, and Heavy Metal.  No, no, no.  Don't rush it.  Oh, turn your headphones way up right here.  How fucking...  All right, let me have the plug, and then you can play it.  Thank you.  Book is out now. 
[02:59:00]  Not now.  This is the best part, Eddie.  Yeah, shut up, Eddie.  Turn it up.  Hard Rock Cafe.  Hard Rock Cafe tonight at 7.  Mendham Books Tuesday at 7.  Book ends, Ridgewood on Wednesday at 7. 
[02:59:30]  book reviewer. I'll get a free meal  from Opie on Thursday in Huntington  at 7. Vintage Vinyl  Fords, New Jersey next Saturday the  9th at 4 p.m. and  Books A Million Sawgrass Mills Mall  at 3 p.m. before  the Maiden Show on the 16th.  And I will also be in L.A. at the  Big Four signing books at the site  of Coachella in Indio, California.  Eddie Tronk, always a pleasure, sir.  It's been too long. Thank you, guys.  Come to the Hard Rock.  You guys coming?  No, I'll be there. 
[03:00:00]  The pre-parties need to be there for free.  Eddie, you're going to be confused  when you leave this studio. Know this.  You're a friend. Thank you, O.  And I like your book. I appreciate it. I just broke character for a second.  Honestly, I appreciate it. Get the hell out of here.  Thank you, guys. Thank you.  How the fuck?  How is Hot for Teacher not on here?  Yeah, what about Hot for Teacher?  You fucking dolt. How did you miss Hot for Teacher?  Run.  Now Hot for Teacher.  God damn, listen to that. 
[03:00:30]  Let's just look at fucking curls right now.  Yes.  No, no, no.  Fucking make that vein pop out.  Incline bench.  That hurts.  We're too old for that shit.  Not me, man.  You look at me.  I'm all inclined press.  You can still do the incline.  That's why I got this gun.  Hold on.  Let it play now.  I could have done without that.  One week.  Coming up.  Now you got to turn it off.  Change.  In nothing space is safe.  Oh. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, you're in the ground running change.  Nice.  In nothing space is safe.  Run change.  Let's go.  Yeah, you're in the ground running change.  In nothing space is safe.  Run change.  Yeah, you're in the ground.  Oh, Eddie Overdubbed.  In nothing space is safe.  The song shut up Jay Moore, so it's got to be good. 
[03:01:30]  Let it play.  Let it play.  Let it play.  Now, how the fuck did he leave that up the list?  He has Pound Cake.  And Hot for Teacher.  No, he goes Pound Cake.  That's rough.  Hot for Teacher.  I would argue for Hot for Teacher.  Hot for Teacher?  Would you argue for any Sammy Hagar, Van Halen songs?  None.  That's not Van Halen to me.  Not a one, right?  I don't give a fuck how many they sold.  Van Halen is fucking Van Halen. 
[03:02:00]  I think they sold more.  I know we have this argument all the time.  No, they did sold 50 times more.  I think we were wrong every time we say that.  No.  They sold 50,000 times more than Diamond Dave.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you ate one too, and 5150, and all that stupid shit.  I think we lose this argument every time we bring it up.  Somebody comes out with the numbers.  You've got to have Ain't Talking About Love.  Absolutely.  And you've got to have Hot for Teacher and Unchained.  What about Little Jamie's Crying, or is that too?  I don't like it.  What about Little Guitars?  Little Guitars is sweet.  What song, or in what order, Hot for Teacher, Unchained, I guess Unchained is one. 
[03:02:30]  No, Unchained, you nailed it.  When you go to the mothership, to that big electron in the sky, as George Carlin says,  when we show them the scented toilet paper, the shoes that light up, and the fake vomit,  and all the cool stuff we've done down here.  That's pretty good.  You've got to play them Unchained on the mothership and go,  this is some fucking shit we worked on when we were down here.  And then you fucking do curls on the mothership. 
[03:03:00]  That song's crazy.  Oh, man.  That's pothead shit.  You ever smoke grass and just do curls, low weight, and just fucking vibe out on your bicep muscle?  I'm thinking of doing some pot again.  I'm thinking about it.  But you can't go Unchained.  What do you start with?  You've got to fucking do the build.  No.  Then I go with Hot for Teacher.  Then start with Ain't Talking About Love.  It's the first track on the first album.  Right.  I mean, they were almost called Black Widow or something, right?  I forget. 
[03:03:30]  Play Ain't Talking About Love, because that's...  How do you leave it?  Fuzzy guitar.  Yeah, how do you leave it off?  There was like one pedal invented then.  I told my wife, if we ever do karaoke, I'm going to get super fucking stoned,  and I'm hitting this out of the fucking park.  I'm doing it.  I'm going to fully do it.  Does she just roll her eyes?  Does she humor you, or does she roll her eyes?  No, she'll tell me if I'm a fucking douche and an idiot.  But most times, she doesn't. 
[03:04:00]  Baby!  Oh.  Not on Eddie Trunk's essential Van Halen playlist.  This didn't make it either?  I got something you need.  Oh, yeah!  Ain't Talking About Love!  How happy would you be, Ope?  Me and you, a couple buds.  We smoke a little bud.  We're at some fucking bizarre karaoke night, and I go,  You got Ain't Talking About...  And I fucking do this.  There you go?  But no irony.  I'll go.  Look in.  I'll go to film it. 
[03:04:30]  Out on the streets again.  Oh, yeah!  I'll bring fucking machetes on stage.  He blew it with the Van Halen playlist.  Bad.  Worse than any other band, right?  Yes.  All right, and Hot Free Teacher?  I like Hot Free Teacher.  Incredible.  I think that might be one.  Hey, we have them on our show.  Little Girl from Cherry Lawn.  How could you be...  Cherry Lawn, New Jersey?  Fucking nice Jersey reference.  I don't know it.  That's where she's from.  That's where the substance is from. 
[03:05:00]  I don't know that.  Little Girl from Cherry Lawn.  How could you be so bold?  I did not know that gold I knew.  This is when they had those drums where they weren't drums.  Like, you'd see them at weddings.  It'd just be a guy with, like, a little cardboard square.  No.  Yeah, you do.  I'm out.  I'm out.  The non-drum drums.  Like, the electric drums.  The guy would just hit, like, a fucking...  All the tiny little fuckers?  Yeah.  Yeah, I gotcha.  Tom-toms.  Thank you.  Kind of Tom-tommy?  No. 
[03:05:30]  They look like this.  Brown napkin.  You know?  Danny, you know.  I think maybe you're talking about drum triggers?  Drum what?  Triggers?  Instead of setting up a drum kit, a guy would set up, like, a drum with, like, little targets.  I don't want to try a kit.  Like, uh...  How is this off the list?  New words.  How's this off?  Danny Trunks list.  Why don't we do this?  Get the plugs in.  Something like that?  We're out of here, Jay.  Time to start the weekend.  Jay Moores is going to be at Foxwoods a week from tonight. 
[03:06:00]  Really?  But, you'll be in next week, right?  Yeah, I'm coming in.  I've got to do a corporate gig.  Hold on a second.  What do you think the teachers are going to look like this, yeah?  I don't feel tardy.  There's no words.  Was this the last great Van Halen song?  Yes.  What came out after this?  It's all, um...  We'll stick with the David Lee Roth years.  Yeah, it's all...  Oh, a little bit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:06:30]  You can see me at this school.  And Eddie's never been better.  Listen to what he dubs on top.  Ding, ding, ding.  Hold on.  I don't know what was never quite like this.  Down, down, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I've got it paid, got it paid, got it paid.  Not on the list.  I'm a carol leaper.  I forgot the, I brought my pencil.  This is the fucking coolest. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, man.  There it is.  This one gets good in the bikini in the video.  Oh, hold on.  We're almost done. 
[03:07:30]  Here you go.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Now we're just playing songs.  Why not?  It's Mystery Science Theater 2000 with music.  Oh, yes, I'm hot!  All right, so I put Unchained first. 
[03:08:00]  Of course.  On the list.  Like, if I put it first out of, like, all the songs ever.  Nah.  Really?  Am I essential, Van Halen?  It's just something about that opening.  Fucking makes you want to kill somebody.  We should write our book.  And knock his book out.  Fuck, yeah.  Let's do that.  Quickly.  Really quickly.  We'll bring it to the hard rock tonight.  We'll go digital.  Digital download.  Tonight.  Digital download tonight.  Tonight!  Your girl and my girl tonight! 
[03:08:30]  What's the number one Van Halen song, then?  Oh, man.  Oh, you nailed it.  Unchained.  Yeah, it has to be.  Isn't it funny when you're at the gym listening to your iPod, the guys around you have no  idea how close they are to being punched in the face?  Because you're just feeling it.  And you fucking rack up, like, you know, like, whatever you're benching, like, incline, you 
[03:09:00]  just fucking rack that shit, and go, like, mind if I work in?  You're like, no, go ahead, you motherfucker under your breath.  Like, I'll fucking get it.  How many more sets you got?  Just two more.  Yeah, you're good.  You're good, you fucking faggot motherfucker.  I'll fucking kill you.  Listen to fucking Jane's Addiction.  Ocean size.  And you got to talk to me now?  Oh, my God.  OMG.  Oh, my God.  Unchained. 
[03:09:30]  Unchained.  Ain't talking about love.  Hot for teacher has to be on that list.  Can we throw Mean Streets in there or no?  I think it's on.  I think Mean Streets is on there.  Oh, we're doing our list outside his list?  No, I'm just saying what he missed.  I go, where's your...  Meanwhile, Rush has 24 fucking songs.  Well, yeah.  And Van Halen has 15.  Mean Streets is not on his list.  I guess for the people out there, Eddie's playlist for Van Halen really quick. 
[03:10:00]  Hear about it later.  Judgment Day.  Good Enough.  Somebody Give Me a Doctor.  Love Walks In.  Atomic Punk.  On Fire.  In a Simple Rhyme.  Romeo Delight.  Light Up the Sky.  Little Dreamer.  Girl Gone Bad.  Pound Cake Fools.  DOA.  I don't know most of those songs by name.  I don't either.  And then when they played Romeo's Delight, I went, oh yeah, no, this can stay on.  So a few of those, I would go, oh yeah, that song.  But how do you keep Number of the Beast off of Van Halen?  I mean, for...  No, how about Run?  You gotta have Run.  Give us Run.  The white man came. 
[03:10:30]  Give us Run.  You wanna end with Run?  Listen to this.  That's great for the fucking gym.  I don't give a fuck.  It's been on the radio a million times.  When you're done with your workout today, gentlemen, hit the treadmill, put it on seven miles an  hour, and just run the length of the song.  Like a man.  And you could do that with this song.  Totally.  Wait, wait.  He's got fucking aces high and two minutes to midnight on his list.  What a dope.  Eddie, you stink.  He killed our cream.  Fuck yeah. 
[03:11:00]  He took our game for his own need.  We brought him home.  Fuck yeah.  It's about fucking trench warfare.  Fuck yeah.  Look at this.  Damn hell.  Atta boy, old.  Tempo change.  Hi-hat.  I think he went for I Gotta Be a Little Too Cool.  I gotta tell.  I gotta tell like it is.  The only good engine is dead. 
[03:11:30]  Here you go.  Can't hit this note anymore.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Run for your lives.  Foxwoods, April 8th. 
[03:12:00]  Foxwoods, April 8th.  I'm gone.  All right, here you go.  Here you go.  Doesn't it seem like...  I love it.  ...you got in the book if you took a picture with Eddie?  Like there's weird, like UFOs in here and stupid things.  But then there's a picture of Eddie with like the leading of UFO.  Like, well, yeah.  As long as a picture with Eddie, you make the book?  That's pretty funny.  And David Lee Roth made it.  He's going to be confused.  We love you, Eddie.  Everyone knows.  We love Eddie Roth.  Yeah, I didn't even know that was up for debate.  That's why I'm sitting on it so hard.  You should know that much before.  Brian May?  Underrated.  I like the Brian May. 
[03:12:30]  He's all right.  Underrated.  He's all right.  He's all right.  Rainbow is in here.  Fucking Rainbow?  What's wrong with Rainbow?  I don't know.  It's fucking...  They're named Rainbow.  What's wrong with Rainbow?  The name is Rainbow.  But they had the Rainbow before the other Rainbow.  What's the best band name?  I like Soundgarden for a band name.  Soundgarden's a great name for a band.  It's a pretty good one.  And a great fucking band.  I like Smashing Pumpkins better than Soundgarden, I realize, listening to my iPod, going through  my gym workout with my priest father, Tim. 
[03:13:00]  What's a song you like by Smashing Pumpkins?  Siamese Dream, to me, is a perfect album.  It's like grunge, but it's more accessible, and the lyrics are much more poetic than the  other guys were doing.  What was the hit song on there?  Cherub Rock.  Cherub Rock's cool.  Fucking...  The one I hated was...  Today is the dream.  You don't like that?  It just...  On that album...  There's some progressive fucking chord changes on that album.  I might have to go through that again. 
[03:13:30]  It's been a while.  If you play Silverfuck, you got that?  From Smashing...  Smashing Pumpkins, Silver...  Is it Silverfuck?  Or Mayonnaise, Silverfuck?  There's some crazy metal songs on there.  And you work out to that?  Yeah, I mostly work out to Jane's Addiction live bootlegs.  Yeah, why do you like Jane's Addiction so much?  When you used to be on Twitter, you tweeted a lot about the Janes.  And Rufus Wainwright to balance it out.  Why do you like Jane's Addiction so much?  I like Mountain...  We argue this point.  I love Mountain songs.  I'm Ocean, you're Mountain. 
[03:14:00]  I love Mountain songs.  I love Mountain songs too, but Ocean Size to me...  I wish I was Ocean Size.  No one moves you, no one tries.  We're all over the place.  You want Silverfuck or you want to go Jane's Addiction now?  We've done this Jane's Addiction.  Let's hear Silverfuck real quick off Siamese Dream.  That's fucking good stuff.  It's very long though, so you can't...  Yeah, I love that sound.  Yeah.  I fucking love that sound.  Let's do a beach run, Oak.  Man on the Silver Mountain, Rainbow. 
[03:14:30]  That's why it's in the book.  That's why it's in the book.  That made it gayer.  Man on the Silver Mountain?  When they're doing that on...  All right.  What are we doing?  Running the beach?  Yeah, this is good for a beach run.  You see where I live, the dolphins.  And what is a dolphin if not a gay shark?  He stole that from Glee!  No, actually they stole it from whoever was saying it.  They actually took that line from someone.  Hey, Sam, what are we doing at 10 o'clock hour? 
[03:15:00]  Well, we have an exclusive interview with Anthony and Jay Moore that was just conducted in the hallway that's riveting.  It was terrific?  Yeah.  I mean, it was amazing stuff.  I'm going home to listen to Siamese Dream.  Oh, but it's perfect.  And it was...  I don't really know the album, Jay.  It's the soundtrack.  When I was on Saturday Night Live, having crazy fucking panic attack, this was the soundtrack.  This is what came out.  They came on to promote this.  Right.  And Cherub Rock is freak out, give in, doesn't matter what you believe in, stay cool, be somebody's fool this year. 
[03:15:30]  Who wants money?  Who wants money?  Like, it was my fucking...  I couldn't believe these bands were...  Talking to you.  Yeah, I was like a fucking crazy, crazy, psychotic, crazy person.  So why would you listen to this if it caused panic attacks?  Because they were...  Oh.  That hits you.  God, that hits you.  I feel no pain.  Where are you at with the panic attacks? 
[03:16:00]  None.  How do you cure yourself?  I take Klonopin daily.  A little bit?  One in the morning, one at night.  What are those?  Half milligram in the morning, half milligram at night.  And when I fly, I'll take like a Xanax.  And just...  Plus, I was very unhappy.  And you know me now.  You know me more than the other guys.  I'm just like a super happy...  Nothing fucking bothers me.  Fuck do I care.  It's the key to life.  Just get some stupid happiness.  Every time I see Gaddafi, he looks like fucking Jeff Ross. 
[03:16:30]  Jeffrey Ross.  Yeah.  Let's go eat.  Jay will be back next week.  We'll talk more about his panic attacks.  We'll tease that.  Hold on.  There's some serious fucking work going on in here.  He's a genius.  Yeah.  I think Billy Corgan's a genius.  Ant doesn't...  I don't think Ant likes Sebastian Puckett.  I'm not sure.  Ant still...  He's fucking...  Right now he's listening to Steve Miller in his limo.  Doot, doot, doot, doot.  It just goes and goes and goes. 
[03:17:00]  How long is this song?  I don't know.  Long?  Like eight minutes.  Long.  All right.  I'll listen to the rest on the way home.  Sam, you ready for this?  Yeah, I was born ready.  All right.  Were you?  I was.  You couldn't fucking feed yourself.  How were you born ready?  I was ready for this.  Rolling?  It's an expression, Sam.  How was the show today, Rolling?  Because officially we're done, so this is like we don't have to try now.  But I was supposed to ask him how was the show.  That's an after show.  This is nice in the background.  Yeah, we could keep this on.  That's what I love about you guys. 
[03:17:30]  When you interview people, you don't have to play fucking, I get knocked down.  And then I get it out the whole time.  Like fucking, why am I listening to this on the fucking Q Morning Zoo in St. Paul?  We try to do it differently.  How did it go today, Roland?  Who did we piss off today?  Are we clean?  Seriously?  Seriously?  Yeah.  Who?  Um, the show.  We'll talk after.  Oh, now.  I can.  I'm rolling.  You fell for his bit.  You made Jay Moore turn a little red, though.  What happened there? 
[03:18:00]  You're a fucking broken neck.  What the fuck do I care about on your show?  Your show.  There's not even a letter J in the font.  Did we do the neck thing justice on the show?  Jay is so fucking crooked.  And he comes in crooked and he's still killed for two and a half hours.  Like, your neck should be way the fuck over here.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Like this?  No.  Like, the bottom is way over here.  Like, it's leaning.  My neck's over here now.  Like, can I push your neck in place?  She wasn't upset.  No, no.  She said, oh, Disney. 
[03:18:30]  She was trying to, uh.  She walked out and said, oh, Disney.  What the fuck are you talking about?  She got diddled when she was six.  What's she talking about?  She works for Disney.  She said, I hope everything went okay.  And, uh.  Yeah, she was cool.  She said, don't worry about it.  Little gentle guitar over the madness, Hope.  You know what?  I think you just turned me on to a song.  It's almost Grateful Dead-esque.  Yeah, I know.  That's why.  This portion.  I kind of liked some of that weird shit.  And he.  He smoked a little grass.  Fucking hang out.  You ever think about why he decided this needed to be in the song? 
[03:19:00]  If you want to go deep.  Constantly.  That's all I think about.  If you want to go deep.  Like, why did he need that little part in the song right there?  She was my lover.  I think about that every time I listen to music.  Like, weird shit in music?  Not hits, obviously.  The weird trippy stuff.  No, constantly.  And, like, when you listen to the Stones, like Monkey Man, like.  You got to be a real rock star to go.  And not be worried that the other people are going to go.  You sound like an idiot.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  I'm a monkey.  Right.  Baby.  But he fucking pulls that off.  Like, why is that in the song?  And was he under the influence?  And if he was under the influence.  I guess vodka, Vicodin, and pot.  That was my question.  This is great NyQuil.  This is like when I was fucking whacked on NyQuil.  This was.  You over that?  No.  I'm a walking fuck.  Yes, of course I'm over it.  How many years?  Have I not done NyQuil?  Those years were wild. 
[03:20:00]  Probably ten.  Wow.  Eight.  I remember.  Sobriety is a lot easier if you put your years in a row.  Way easier if you just fucking line them all up one after the other.  When you take breaks, it's really hard.  I did a few runs with you to the store in between Caroline's shows.  The good old days.  The NyQuil.  And they go, we got the pills.  And I'm like, fuck pills.  The NyQuil pills.  The NyQuaps. 
[03:20:30]  You need the liquid.  Yeah.  Any fucking, anybody can take the.  I never understood that.  I'll be honest.  All right.  What's that?  Why that?  Why is that there?  Here we come.  We're coming back now.  Hold on.  It's coming back.  What a bald genius. 
[03:21:00]  Not unlike Roland.  Back to you, Roland.  All right, Roley.  What's up?  Let's fade this out.  Or just keep it low.  Why in the NyQuil, Jay?  Because I wasn't drinking.  It's a weird buzz, though, isn't it?  It's a great one.  It's like snorting heroin.  It's great when you just.  It's fucking amazing.  But you did it.  I think you, well.  Two bottles a day for every day for two years. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, I know.  In between shows, though.  That's what I noticed.  My dick looked like a button, and I peed green out of my butt.  I was just a polluted, walking polluted.  But you were able to do shows, and great shows.  I was able to do them drunk.  Yeah, but that shit makes you wait fucking sleepy.  After a while, you weren't sleeping anymore?  No, it's not about.  You got to push through the part where you get sleepy.  It's like a heroin addict that doesn't nod off.  I would never be able to do that.  Yeah, I think that's how you're supposed to do Xanax as well. 
[03:22:00]  You're supposed to plow through it.  Yeah, I got no plow.  I got no plow left in me.  No.  Can I ask?  Is this the part?  What?  Roland, what's going?  I don't understand.  What's happening right now with Roland?  Why'd you bring him in and ask him what happened?  Oh, my fucking neck.  All right.  You got to go to a chiropractor.  Let's have Kenny call back and promote something.  Yeah.  No, this part.  I heard it at a show.  Oh, no.  Me?  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  Hold on.  The music will carry us.  Oh, yeah.  I have...  Are you still talking about that?  I talk openly about having really bad sperm.  I didn't want to put you in a bad spot.  So we're trying to make babies.  But you made that really funny when I saw you at Gotham.  So I'm going to get a ball operation to take my sperm out of my ball bag because my sperm 
[03:23:00]  doesn't come out of my urethra.  It just fucking hangs out.  It's like migrant workers.  They don't feel like going anywhere.  But you got the sperm.  I got them very little, very few, but they don't leave.  But they work.  So when I ejaculate...  They stay behind.  There's nothing in it.  So when I get a sperm test, it says azoospermic.  Oh, my neck.  I don't know what... 
[03:23:30]  I'll be honest with you.  I don't know what this sounds like.  And in a way...  It hurts so bad.  I have to shit.  What happened?  I'm in so much pain.  I have to vomit.  Wait, you can't...  So is that the tease for next week with the ball operation?  Next week, I'm in a ball operation.  Oh, my God.  I have to go to the bathroom.  What is happening is right.  I read your lips, Danny.  I'm not getting...  Shut up, bro.  What are you doing?  Are you going to shit your pants?  Yeah, I don't know.  We're going to do a job. 
[03:24:00]  Where is it?  It's all the way.  It's to the right.  And it's to the right.  Yeah.  Look, I don't need your tweets.  I don't need your tweets.  I really don't know what this sounds like.  But I do know I'm enjoying the hell out of myself right now.  I don't...  I don't even care if you're enjoying this.  This is so fucking weird.  Jay had to go to the bathroom.  What happened?  He had to go poo-poo.  Because his neck hurt so bad he had to shit. 
[03:24:30]  People have to understand that his whole head and neck are way over to the left side of his body.  Like, way the fuck over.  Or, like, he's got a real situation that he has to take care of.  Like, he looks like the alien from Men in Black when it took over the farmer.  Right, exactly.  Exactly.  He ran all the way down the hallway.  He was going to shit himself.  He must be in a situation because he's in such pain I don't even think he can walk and he just ran.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To get the shit he's out.  And his legs are all stiff-legged.  What are we doing, Sam? 
[03:25:00]  Well, I mean, we didn't get a chance to air The Rock walking out of the show yesterday.  So we're going to air it today.  Okay.  Um, we also got...  Did you guys get, uh, anyone, um, email that other audio of him?  No, we don't have it yet.  Not yet.  I hope someone mails that in.  I know someone out there has it.  We're also, I believe we are going to play, uh, the David Tyree interview that we discussed.  Okay.  On my giant tickets for life?  Yes.  The franchise owner.  And we'll talk to Roland about losing his Giants tickets.  Okay.  Uh, and we're going to see how UROC feels after, uh, getting shit on for about two hours this morning. 
[03:25:30]  I, I, uh, I feel like we have to wait now for Jay to come back.  Yeah?  Whoever doesn't want to continue is fine.  I don't care.  I just, I, I, he, he ran down the hall to shit because he has a bad neck.  I, I need to know what the fuck's going on.  Yeah.  I mean, he's definitely shitting right now.  Although it must be hard for him to sit on a toilet with the neck and back stiff like that.  I hope the, uh, Smashing Pumpkins didn't bring on another panic attack or something. 
[03:26:00]  He was getting a little.  He didn't seem like he was having a panic attack.  Something was going on in his eyes.  It was bringing him back to a place, I think.  I think because he thought he was going to shit himself.  So he was just holding it in and then he couldn't handle it anymore?  Yeah.  And then the pain came in.  I was willing to end the show 20 minutes ago.  He was the one that wanted to continue with the Van Halen, even though he had a shit.  Because he ate an egg and cheese sandwich.  Oh, yeah.  And so, yeah.  They made it extra greasy, too.  It's extra greasy, so that's probably slipping through.  Are the broad-minded girls mad at us because we kept Eddie? 
[03:26:30]  I don't think so.  And is Eddie all right with how we handled them?  Eddie's fine, yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  I think he's never been able to figure us out.  I thought broad-minded is pretty good.  Well, you guys, you guys are hard to figure out because you never know.  Like, you say, okay, you're a good guy, but then you spend much more time insulting people  than saying the good things.  And so they're like, what the fuck?  Yeah, but when the mics are off, I look them right in the eyes and I just say, hey, man,  great to see you.  Yeah, but then you spent 20 minutes.  So they're assuming that where most DJs are phony when the mics are on, that you guys are 
[03:27:00]  phony when the mics are off and really hate them the way you say it on the air.  Because you come across as being very...  We come across a little too negative?  Well, you're very negative people.  Huh.  A little bit, Roland?  I mean, the show is a cesspool for negativity.  Liam's not happy that you're calling him back in, by the way.  Why?  You have somewhere else to go?  Jay Moore left because he has a...  No, no, I don't have anywhere else to go.  I'm done now.  Jay Moore left because his neck hurt so bad he had to go shit. 
[03:27:30]  I thought it was because Unchained wasn't in the book.  Yeah, we came up with a few more problems.  Oh, Jesus.  What were the other songs we decided?  Hot for Teacher.  We played the whole thing and now we're starting to think that should have made the book.  Really?  Yeah.  I always thought that song was kind of goofy.  What was the greatest...  I asked Jay, what was the last good Van Halen song with David Lee Roth?  Jay basically said Hot for Teacher.  In your opinion, if you could think that way. 
[03:28:00]  Well, again, people are going to go crazy about this.  I was never a big Panama fan.  Obviously, we're talking about 1984 because that was the last real record, okay?  So Hot for Teacher, Panama, never a big fan.  Jump, forget about it.  When I first heard Jump and I heard that keyboard thing, it was like I almost hurled.  I was like, this can't be Van Halen.  Maybe something on that album.  Panama.  Panama over Hot for Teacher. 
[03:28:30]  I'm going to have to bring that up.  What about Drop Dead Legs, man?  That's a great song on 1984.  Yeah, that's a pretty good song.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  I just...  For me, Open, you know this because you did music radio forever.  You know this.  I mean, the songs that always came up on your playlist are the ones you kind of like bristled  at.  It's like...  Except for Run for the Hills.  Or to the Hills.  Run to the...  But that barely...  That didn't get played that much.  That wasn't like a hit hit.  You're right.  You know, but...  And for me, that song, Everywhere I Go and whenever I go to Iron Maiden... 
[03:29:00]  You know, Maiden doesn't play that song live.  They haven't played it the last couple of years because they're burnt out on it.  Get the...  Swear to God.  You should have seen the crowd went almost nuts because the house lights go on and  Don't Run to the Hills.  Get the fuck out.  Swear to God.  The last few tours.  Why would you do that?  Because don't you think more people are in the audience that want to hear that song  than don't?  And that's always the point.  And I think that song probably bought a few really nice cars and really nice castle somewhere.  But see, Iron Maiden have an interesting situation with America because I've always 
[03:29:30]  said I think it's a little bit of a love-hate thing.  They don't...  They really, really don't like the fact that their new music isn't played and supported  in America.  Outside of...  They're a global band.  I mean, there's Stadium Act around the world.  And their new music, their records chart and they get a lot of success.  But here, you know, everyone wants to talk about Run to the Hills and Number of the Beast  and they just can't take it anymore.  And they just...  They played one tour where they played nothing but music from the last 10 years and nothing  else.  I don't mind that if the band tells you ahead of time. 
[03:30:00]  Exactly.  They're sick of hearing it, but my Neil Young story where I didn't know that he decided  he wasn't going to play really anything familiar as far as, you know, the hits that we all  know.  I didn't know ahead of time.  If you tell me ahead of time, then let me...  Then I'll decide.  Petty did that too.  Really?  Yeah, Petty did a bunch of stuff from his new album, but that's it.  And I tell fans all the time that bitch about it.  It's like, it's real easy.  One click on the internet and you can find out after one show anywhere in the world what  the playlist is going to be.  But this Neil Young story goes before the internet was what it is today. 
[03:30:30]  Why are you running in here?  Jay's wiping.  He's coming back now, Mars?  Well, he's wiping.  It's going to be a long week with Jay Moore, let's be honest with each other.  He's a great talent.  Jay's here all next week with you?  Oh my God.  With no Anthony.  God help me.  Hey Jay, how'd it go?  That was close.  Hope was just talking about how much he's looking forward to having you here all next  week.  Oh yeah, he's going to save the show.  I almost shit my pants. 
[03:31:00]  But why did...  I don't know why.  You were the one that wanted to continue.  I was ready to end 20 minutes ago if you had a log poking out.  I didn't.  I just looked at you and suddenly there was a flash panic.  You were prairie dogging?  No, it was going to be, you know, like throwing mud off a roof.  It was messy?  It was horrible.  I had to wipe my legs.  What's going on with you?  I think my neck is fucking up the rest of my body.  Really?  It's...  I just told...  It's from sleeping. 
[03:31:30]  I just told everyone, no, you got to push the whole fucking thing back in the middle.  It's...  But chiropractor scares me.  I don't want some fat guy sitting on my fucking neck.  Like, how's that going to fix it?  Well, I hate when they twist it really quick.  Isn't that for your bones more than your muscles?  I need massage...  Acupuncture is what I need.  You need...  Some massage places, you know, know how to...  There's one at my hotel.  Work it out a little bit.  Oh, then there you go.  They shove it in.  I wrote that.  He's coming in next week.  Good.  I'll be here when he's here.  Otto and George and Jamie Moore.  I love Otto and George.  If you only knew how much I actually... 
[03:32:00]  Like...  Can we finish the ball story and then we can all go home?  Yeah.  So, you have sperm.  Not a lot, but they will make a baby.  So, now...  But you have to get them.  And I never...  Usually they have to retrieve an egg.  Yeah.  My wife's got big, giant, fluffy, incroyable eggs.  They're ready.  And the only reason I bring this up...  My sperm are fucking bouncing into each other on the way there.  I heard you talk about this at Gotham.  So, you're going to have your ball bag split and then going...  I thought you were going to have this already.  We tried...  I went to acupuncture to get my sperm count up and it worked. 
[03:32:30]  So, then we tried IUI insemination three times that way.  But even when you fucking drop them off at the door, they just turn around and go...  What?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  I had to tell you, I'm a little envious hearing about this sort of stuff because I have two  kids and both times, both kids, one shot done.  I didn't even have any fun trying to make kids.  It was like one shot done both times.  Way to rub it in.  You're envious of me not being able to...  No.  I'm envious that... 
[03:33:00]  I don't mean that...  Way to rub it in.  No, I don't mean that.  Holy shit.  I don't mean it like that.  I mean it envious that...  You know, fuck you.  For people that...  And fuck your butt.  No, no, no.  I didn't mean it like that, Jay.  I don't know what your situation is.  I'm not upset.  I'm curious.  I'm envious.  No, you're in shock.  I'm envious that people that have...  You get to work at it for a little bit because I didn't even have that fun.  Why don't you just work at it without having a kid?  Of course I know, but you know what I'm saying.  I only make love to reproduce.  Well, because you know what happens when a kid comes.  It's like, forget about it.  I got two kids running crazy.  How old are your kids now?  I want a madhouse.  Three and seven.  Oh, it's a madhouse, man.  If I get like twin girls, just be out of the... 
[03:33:30]  Because I got my eight-year-old son.  I'm like, how can I be azospermatic if I have a fucking kid already?  Like, if I'm a pod?  How do they explain that?  He was a test tube baby.  They took my sperm.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I had more...  I used to have more sperm.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  But the six that I have, they're all like luggage handlers at JFK.  So we're trying to go private school sperm here.  Oh, he's got the fucking...  He's bullseye right there.  Huh?  His son's fucking...  Well, beautiful.  How old's your kid now, Oh? 
[03:34:00]  Ten and a half.  Pushing 11, actually.  What am I saying?  Wow.  11 months next week.  Beautiful, man.  Mobile?  Is he real mobile?  Yeah, Jay saw him.  He was the hit of the Law and Order set.  He's intense, man.  He stares, stares, and then he gives you like a...  I'm just fucking with you.  Like, he mad dogs you for like two hours, and then right when you're like...  All right, I'm bothering this kid.  He goes, nah, for real.  Hang out.  You're the fucking man.  He's pretty chill.  I'm lucky.  He's not like me.  Put it this way.  My kid's three, and he almost weighs what I weigh already. 
[03:34:30]  My kid's enormous.  He's going to be a big chooch like me.  It's insane.  Put it this way.  Opie's son is so well-behaved, he's a baby, and you could have him on a live set, and  they never go, cut.  Whose baby was that?  There was a couple times it got close.  I know.  That was him or Billy Hayes.  Billy Hayes was laughing his ass off, because all of a sudden he's got a mic stand in his  hand, and he's going to drop it at any second.  I like when the lady bent over to get shoes off the ground.  There was a wardrobe lady.  This is a true story about Jay's about to say. 
[03:35:00]  The son leaned over and just started rubbing her head.  And I'll let Opie elaborate.  And then he might have...  She wasn't a Caucasian woman, so to watch someone rubbing the head of...  And he might have used his bicep a little bit.  He was rubbing it like...  Yeah, I know.  Like it was the little rascals.  Yeah.  She had a tiny head.  Did we talk about that in your trailer?  Her head's really small. 
[03:35:30]  She was cool, though.  And you're dead.  We just listen to Smashing Pumpkins when you're out.  You're not a Smashing Pumpkin.  They're not in the book.  When did you stop liking music?  By the way, I just...  No, what year?  What year?  What year?  I just checked my Twitter feed.  I have like 140 mentions from fucking pests.  I'm like, no, you don't understand.  And all of them are saying how horribly you fucked up Van Halen.  Why?  How the fuck do you not have...  Buy the book and tell me it's fucked up.  Why?  Just because of one song on a playlist?  Hot for Teacher?  Eddie, I got to... 
[03:36:00]  Hot for Teacher's kind of goofy.  I got a business idea for you.  As opposed to fucking Pound Cake?  Yeah, I love Pound Cake.  Do you get a website?  Do I?  Pound Cake was at EddieHank.com, yeah.  So why don't you have people discuss songs that should be in your book?  Because that would cause traffic and interest, Opie.  He's not interested in that.  What are you saying again?  What do you mean?  You didn't fucking...  It just came out today.  You didn't fucking put Unchained on.  That's the one we will not let you go on.  All right, but...  Hold on one sec.  Oh, and somebody wrote, if you want to see how messed up Smashing Pumpkins were during 
[03:36:30]  Siamese Dream, check out Viewphoria, the movie they made for it, which I didn't even know  was out, so they must have been really fucked up.  So that's good.  I swear to you, if we get to a second printing, and maybe thanks to your plugs we will, I will  have them clear space and add Unchained with a little asterisk.  And I will put for Opie and Jay Moore in the thing.  No, you don't do four.  You give us a page.  A what?  I want a page in your next book.  You're going to pick songs?  What about Die With Your Boots On, Fire Maiden?  Great song.  But why is it on the fucking...  I can't.  Two minutes to midnight?  Let me tell you something. 
[03:37:00]  What are you in your fucking garage?  Wait a minute.  Two minutes to midnight is bad?  It's not as good as...  Run to the...  Run to the Hills.  The fact that...  I feel like Colin talking to Bobby.  The fact that you left off Run to the Hills.  Shut your face.  Jay, I did the playlist like two years ago.  Listen to me.  It doesn't matter.  The song was written in the 80s.  I'm going to explain something to you.  I wrote these things and I put all these songs in there.  And then the editor says, you've got to cut back 15 songs. 
[03:37:30]  Not on Rush.  They have 24 songs.  It depends upon...  They have short titles.  But...  YYZ.  Hold on.  LimeLight.  Hold on.  But...  Unchained.  Yeah.  Back...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ape.  Back to Jay's point.  You had to cut 15 songs.  That means fucking 15...  You still have 15 songs in there that you think is better than Jay's song.  Unchained.  Yeah.  I'm sorry that Unchained has never been one of my favorite songs.  I know Jay has flashbacks to his football years in Verona or whatever. 
[03:38:00]  But for me, it was not one of my favorite songs.  Was it like a fucking Guido that I'd be running around playing football?  What did you say you played?  I wrestled.  I wrestled.  I'm sorry.  You know what you do in football practice?  You play football.  Danny...  I grew up in Madison, so my football...  Hold on.  Neil O'Donnell.  Eddie, I got to...  Yeah, I went to high school with Neil.  Eddie, I got a challenge for you.  Danny's a Metallica fan.  Right?  Yeah.  Let's look at the list.  Ride the Lightning's not on there.  I'm fucking going home.  Yeah, let's look at the list.  Is Ride the Lightning on the list?  Whoa.  This is...  I don't know.  I don't remember. 
[03:38:30]  Of course Ride the Lightning wrote.  What the fuck?  It's...  The playlist...  What kind of fucking publisher...  Wait.  The playlist in the book is like 2% of the book.  You can tell he used to have it in his own show.  Your dwelling on the playlist is 2% of the book.  It's not...  If it's too...  Obviously, it's the most intriguing part of the book.  No, it's not.  You didn't read it.  Everyone in the room is obsessing over the playlists.  What book?  Because people could argue your playlist.  I like that.  That's the most impressive...  I like that.  That's what's happening right now.  But I like that idea.  What kind of...  It's a water cooler conversation.  It's a driveway moment, Eddie. 
[03:39:00]  You pulled me back into the studio for a second time.  Eddie, what kind of publisher do you have...  Hold on.  What kind of publisher do you have that you write a book and they hold it for two years?  Well, it's from the time I wrote that.  But yeah, it took six months of printing alone before they put it out.  I'm glad you didn't take the book seriously.  What?  That you don't know what's...  All right, where's Metallica?  I don't really know every song I put.  I love all these songs.  Let me just make a statement.  Page 130 right now.  Right now, 130.  If Ride the Lightning isn't there, there's no reason for you to be here. 
[03:39:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Wow.  Is it in there?  Yeah, but it's 10.  I don't even know.  I'm looking at Jay.  Jay exhaled like he just...  I was like, wow, I'm going to have to leave.  Let's go to Danny, who knows Metallica.  Danny?  So, all right.  What's the stipulations here?  I just got to rattle off tunes that are on the list.  What song by Metallica?  No, no, no, no.  Not necessarily.  You like Metallica, so do you agree or disagree with Eddie Trunk's list?  Now, I'll give Eddie this much.  He does want to go with the songs that you've heard a million fucking times.  You can't put Enter Sandman on there?  But that was just quite curious for 666, Number to Beast. 
[03:40:00]  What about Wherever I May Roam, though?  By Neil Young?  Long May You Roam.  You stuff I like better on the Black Album than that, man.  I love Wherever I May Roam.  Why's it got to be Black?  I love that fucking song.  You like that song, Danny, or not so much?  Wherever I May Roam.  Of Wolf and Man's a great song on that album.  That's definitely a great tune.  I agree.  I agree.  My Friend of Misery.  There's a lot of good stuff.  That's not the norm.  Come on.  I'm about to shit my...  And the newest Metallica album, to me, is their best album since Master Puppets.  That's what I hear from a lot of people.  I like St. Anger.  I'm the only person that likes St. Anger. 
[03:40:30]  Except for it sounds like shit.  The new Metallica album's totally distorted and over-modulated, but the songs themselves  are great.  Danny, I'm going to give you the Metallica list, because you have Don't Tread on Me on  there.  You're all right with that?  Yes, I am.  Good.  Look, I'm blessed.  All right, let's go.  I'll sacrifice my Wherever I May Roam for the Don't Tread on Me.  The Unforgiven.  Yes?  Danny?  Yeah, you've got to have that on there.  The original Unforgiven.  They've done five songs.  Absolutely.  I agree with that.  The Four Horsemen.  Yeah.  Yeah, although...  There's no...  Yeah.  There's no...  No, I'll tell you why.  That strip... 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  That strips that...  Right.  There's no doubt.  Sound.  There's no doubt.  No.  Like, if I said to you Van Halen Unchained, you'd go, fuck yeah.  You don't think about it.  And if I go Little Romeo, you'd go, ah, yeah, I get...  You know.  Yeah, he wants to drive around Rome and a fucking Camaro.  I think Danny's...  Yeah.  No, my yes is for different reasons than probably...  Why don't you open to the page and follow along and be a part of the group?  130.  Yeah, we're in class again.  Sniff the pages like a ditto.  Here we go.  The Four Horsemen? 
[03:41:30]  Four Horsemen, I think it's a great song, but I think that people credit...  I give a little too much credit to Metallica for it, considering Mustaine wrote most of  it.  Yeah, it was a song called Mechanics, right?  I don't need to know how you perform the fucking trick.  Do you like the trick?  Four Horsemen, yes or no?  Four Horsemen, is he?  It has to be on the playlist.  Yeah.  It's an easy...  Okay.  Is it?  Eddie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're...  I swear to God, Eddie.  What?  Is it?  I'm asking.  I don't remember.  It's what I put in there.  Don't tread on me.  If we talked about the stories in the book, I could give you a million years.  You're focused on one part of the own book. 
[03:42:00]  I like the one.  Danny, you like the one?  Danny, you're the one.  I like the one.  I'm starting to see some issues with the list.  Okay.  Here we go.  So one, yes.  Battery?  I love Battery.  Gotta love Battery, man.  I mean, come on.  Do you think that should not be?  It's a great song.  Absolutely.  So sludgy and heavy.  Disposable Heroes.  That's the first problem.  I have a problem with that.  I have a problem with that.  I have a problem with that.  You don't like disposable heroes?  Yeah.  But if we're talking about a 15-song playlist of Metallica, I don't think that...  Fight fire with fire.  Yeah.  We all shall die. 
[03:42:30]  Ride the Lightning should be the first one.  I know they're in no order, but for me...  Number one, Ride the Lightning?  I once said to a kid...  I didn't know Metallica until like 10 years ago, and my friend's daughter's boyfriend  was at the house.  It was like 16-year-old kids, and I go...  His kid's name was Amir.  I go, Amir, let me ask you a question.  He goes, what?  I go, let's say, hypothetically, I was going to smoke a ton of grass and listen to Metallica.  He goes, Ride the Lightning.  Before I finish, he goes, Ride the Lightning.  I go, with big headphones...  He goes, Ride the Lightning.  I go, no, I mean, I'm really going to fight...  He goes, Ride the Lightning. 
[03:43:00]  He wouldn't let me finish.  And then you tell me what you think of it.  Because if I was going to go home and just rip all day and listen to Metallica, I think  first on my list is probably Orion.  And I think I'll set Orion up for every fifth song.  I don't know the song.  It's an instrumental.  It is an instrumental, but I think it's so...  There's nothing wrong with an instrumental.  No.  It's incredible.  It's an incredible song.  Ope was talking about Rush before.  Livia Strangiano is one of the great ones.  Not on the list, Van Halen.  You really fucked up Van Halen.  You really fucked up Van Halen.  You really fucked up Van Halen.  Eruption's a mini guitar thing.  I'm surprised you'd put Summer Nights in my radio and your fucking gay Van Halen list. 
[03:43:30]  Did you read Sammy Hagar's book?  No, I was washing my hair.  We didn't even want him on.  Oh, he talks about what went on during Eruption guitar solos under the stage, but...  Creeping Death?  These are all great songs.  Yes or no?  Yes.  It doesn't make the ultimate playlist.  For Whom the Bell Toll...  Yes.  Now, here's the rest of my problems.  It's all next.  Two by four, Broken...  Yeah.  What?  Broken Beat and the Scarlet.  I'm trying to pull some stuff, a little something from the catalog of...  It's an ultimate playlist.  I know, but I'm not going to...  Can you be? 
[03:44:00]  It's not a hit.  I'm trying to be cool.  It's not trying to be cool.  Eddie Weezer, just grab the fucking songs out of the air that you want.  Let's go back to Van Halen.  Yeah.  But we didn't even get around to Damage Incorporated.  How about Aerosmith?  Nobody wants a...  Oh, you know, Andy Richter told me once...  Motorbreath.  Motorbreath?  Motorbreath?  Sure, I can fucking speak.  Do it, man.  Seek and Destroy.  Seek and Destroy.  Oh!  Seek and Destroy.  Do you think Seek and Destroy?  I gotta rip...  Stupid, Eddie.  I gotta rip this page out of the book.  When you're dealing with bands like Van Halen and Metallica, who 95% of their shit is great, 
[03:44:30]  it's kind of hard to make everybody happy.  You don't have to make everybody happy, just us.  I love Two by...  I think Two by Four is a great song.  I don't think it's part of that.  It's also a nice cut of wood.  From that period, I tried to get a little something from the entire history of the band, too.  You know, I wanted to show different eras, as well.  You have been all over the ice discussing what your criteria was for the Ultimate Playlist.  The Ultimate Playlist should be the fucking Ultimate Playlist night.  Hey, you know what?  I don't have anything off the fucking Diver Down. 
[03:45:00]  I better go in there.  You shouldn't ever have to think about it too long.  This shit is done for one reason.  Watch your mind, Chris.  For exactly the reason why we're doing right now, to inspire debate.  On my TV show...  No, we just said it was 2% of the book!  Right, we told you the debate game.  I know that, but listen, on the TV show that I do, we have a thing called the TMS Top 5.  And when we start that thing, it's our five favorite bass players.  Do you know that mail we get emails, you left out this guy!  Well, of course, you know, what are you going to do?  You've got to pick five guys!  That's why you put it in the book when we had to explain to you what's the best part of the book. 
[03:45:30]  The playlist?  Yes.  Really?  Absolutely.  That was, to me, that was like the least thing.  In all fairness, I haven't read the stories yet, but this catches your eye.  No, I'll read the stories.  Everybody I've talked to, it's all about these stories.  They want the stories.  I mean, every single band in that book, there's a story.  We haven't mentioned one story yet.  I know, because you didn't read it.  Because we can't take our eyes off the fucking playlist!  Every time!  I'm looking at a fucking anthrax!  I don't even like anthrax!  I'm looking at the fucking playlist!  How about you tell the story? 
[03:46:00]  I don't want to read it.  No, I want to go back to Van Halen.  Just give me a band, and I'll give you the story.  I don't know.  Why is Bon Jovi under heavy metal?  Read the first paragraph, and I'll tell you.  Well, were you going to tell me?  Well, no, I'm telling you.  Would it be redundant if you told me after I read it?  Because to me, Bon Jovi, people forget.  Bon Jovi's the only...  Jon Bon Jovi became the face of the heavy metal scene, and was so influential that even record  labels paid attention to the other bands he liked.  He kept the scene alive.  You're not reading the beginning, Jay.  You said read the first paragraph! 
[03:46:30]  Is that the first page?  You don't know!  Go back!  Oh, sorry.  See?  Thank you.  I do know.  Oh, you did know on that one.  I was on Rainbow.  In the 1980s, there was no bigger band in the world of arena rock than Bon Jovi.  It's easy to forget where they came from, because over the years, they've completely reinvented  and distanced themselves from the scene they gave.  Little Runaway wasn't a metal song.  Jay, the book is hard rock and heavy metal.  Bon Jovi's definitely hard rock in that period of time.  Continue. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, shit.  That's what we want to hear, Eddie.  About time you got your fucking balls.  I got balls.  Van Halen, are you going to admit that you fucked up the Van Halen playlist?  No!  We gotta go home, Eddie.  How could you not?  Because, Jay.  A pound cake.  As I said when you first started with this.  You have poison in here.  When you first started with this, as I said, Van Halen's one of those bands, it's more  about...  Let's turn this around, if you will.  What Van Halen songs are awful?  Can we come up with that list? 
[03:47:30]  OBJ, anybody?  Yeah.  What Van...  If you're doing...  If you're doing the 15...  Higher and higher, Stuart, right up we collide.  Taking out Van...  It's a fucking Celine Dion song.  Taking...  Okay.  From the Roth era, what Van Halen songs are awful?  Me, Wise, Magic, awful.  What else?  More importantly, we did not get Eddie until about 947.  Remind me not to switch with O&A ever again.  Who said that?  What's that? 
[03:48:00]  One of the broads from BroadMinded.  The BroadMinded Producer?  What does that mean?  Eddie, you got a much bigger audience here.  You should never even went there.  I didn't book any of this.  You should have just stayed.  I'm back.  And now they're mad at us.  Who?  I'm sorry.  You told...  What guest do we get that they get besides Eddie Trunk?  That's it.  All right.  Tell them to go screw.  Oh, sorry.  I dropped my black beard.  Oh, my God.  All right.  You want to go with Def Leppard?  No, let's...  The best part about this book is the essential playlist. 
[03:48:30]  No, it's not.  It's the least thing.  How could you disagree with my opinion?  The photos.  No one's ever seen those photos.  The stories.  The best part about photos.  Every...  Jay.  You're my fucking grandma.  Come on in.  You want to see it when he was nine?  Jay.  This is Richie Blackmore when he was at the...  Jay.  You didn't read the book.  It's like picking up a magazine and just looking at the pull-out thing, you know?  How is Jay going at it?  Holy shit.  Now it's bullshit.  Now I text the guy all day long.  He won't text me back.  He's a big author now.  I'm in here over here. 
[03:49:00]  Are you a Van Halen fan?  Of course I'm a Van Halen fan.  All right.  Turn to page one.  How could you not be?  Here we go.  No, don't say a word, Eddie.  Eddie, I just want you to see this list cold and tell us what you think.  Did you get the book yet, Chris?  No, I haven't.  Shut up, Eddie.  Eddie?  Eddie?  I've never met this man before.  Look on with a friend.  Go to page...  What page am I looking at?  That coffee smells good.  It's too bad I've had 47.  Oh, wait a minute.  Shut up.  Go ahead, Jericho.  Get into this because...  Why are you screaming, everybody?  Something just hit me about Jericho and this is going to be great.  So go ahead, Chris.  I'm going to kick back and watch... 
[03:49:30]  Page 230.  Page 230.  230.  This is Eddie's ultimate Van Halen essential playlist.  Okay, here we go.  You tell us what's missing.  What's missing?  Typical pretentious Eddie Trunk.  Hear about it later, number one.  Judgment Day.  He's getting fucking heated up.  Look at him.  Atomic Pomp out of work in his simple rhyme.  Romeo Delight, Light Up the Sky, Little Dreamer.  We're about to get in trouble again.  Hot for Teacher, the best Van Halen song not on there.  Jericho's supposed to go live in one minute on another channel. 
[03:50:00]  Hot for Teacher is missing, which is the best Van Halen song.  That was the best Van Halen group ever.  Come on.  Dude, the one song we're all...  Panama is not on here?  No.  I sort of...  You're not going to get this from him, Ope.  You're not going to get this from him.  Because tell him, Chris, who's your favorite singer in Van Halen?  Play it.  Roth.  I thought you were Hagar.  No.  I'm the Roth guy.  You're stupid.  I'm the Roth guy.  Come on, man.  You love the Hagar stuff.  Yeah, but Roth is my hero.  He loves the Hagar stuff.  I wanted to be the David of the Roth of wrestling. 
[03:50:30]  What?  We're going to get in.  I want to talk about music on the one day.  Just fucking play the songs.  Jericho's supposed to be on OutQ right now.  Wait, play one second.  OutQ right now is great.  Chris, do you like the song Pound Cake?  Yes.  Thank you.  I do.  And good enough also.  Should it be here instead of Unchained?  All right, we're getting in trouble.  Where's it got to go?  It's a great tune.  It's got a great solo to it.  Thank you.  It's probably the best Van Halen song.  I got to go.  I want to stay here.  We got another problem on our hands.  OutQ's mad at us?  Oh, dancing.  No, he's just their schedule.  Dancing.  What show are they doing now? 
[03:51:00]  We're the only show here.  What's OutQ?  We're the only show here.  Who's on OutQ?  OutQ's the gay channel.  I know, but who's watching it?  Jericho?  I like the gays.  Yeah, Jericho was supposed to be on it a couple minutes ago.  What?  Are they mad, man?  They're cool?  No, no, they're fine.  Is it our pals or is it another show now?  What?  Is it the morning guys still?  It's still the morning guys.  They're all right.  We were talking about weight loss.  They just gave them a live intro and they just sat there with the door open.  I'm waiting.  I'm probably down to 200 right now.  Jesus.  All right, let's go home.  Eddie, your book is going to sell a lot. 
[03:51:30]  It's exceptional.  It's going to...  But I think you super...  Your publisher, which is Abrams Image, they really...  They tied one of your hands behind your back, Eddie.  No, with what?  Cutting the playlist?  Yeah.  They should have let you have the playlist.  But I don't believe, Eddie, on the cutting the playlist.  They did, Jay.  I'm going to...  Give me your email.  I'll send you my real playlist that I made.  No, Jay's on to something because it...  How do you not have two...  Oh, you do have two...  You want to make it look like a greatest hits album, so he wanted it this way.  Molly Crew is pretty good. 
[03:52:00]  Too Fast for Love.  Yeah, you want to...  Molly Crew, you take the entire first album and just smack it on the playlist.  Best album.  The first album.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too Fast for Love.  Super high, boys.  The best album.  You know, Jay, just to talk about the editing, in the back of that book, the last two pages,  it's more essentials, and there's like three paragraphs of books that are just bands with  one chapter, and you know what?  Those bands were all full chapters.  I had to cut all those back to one paragraph.  I have the opposite problem.  I hand in my book, and they go, that's 60 pages, dummy. 
[03:52:30]  And I'm like, I've been writing for four months.  And they go, no, it's got to be at least 200.  I'm like, all right.  Eddie, looking like an author in the back.  That's from the set of the TV show.  You see that, Jay?  His author picture is better than your author picture.  It sure is.  I look like a special boy.  All right, we're going to go home finally, because...  All right, I'll see you guys next week, Monday, Tuesday.  But read the stories, really.  Come back to me when you read the stories.  You will.  That's the best part of the book.  Oh, wow.  These are the bands you didn't include.  They got cut.  Yeah, but you...  Who got cut?  Hold on a minute. 
[03:53:00]  Queensryche...  Triumph.  Cinderella had no business being on here, so that's good.  You don't like Cinderella?  No.  Very underrated band.  I think so.  Very underrated band.  True.  Grunge knocked them out when they were about to hit.  And they also, because they were so glammed up on their first album, they actually are  a bluesy rock band.  You know who knocked Poison and Cinderella out with one shot?  Nirvana.  Jane's Addiction.  Nirvana.  Before Nirvana.  Jane's Addiction.  Jane's was around before Nirvana.  Jane's Addiction came out, and we went...  Soundgarden was around before Jane's, weren't they?  Jane's Addiction. 
[03:53:30]  Jane's...  Jane's Addiction changed what we were listening to.  It's such an important band.  Nothing Shocking was 88, and their live album was 86.  All of a sudden, you got Mountain Song and Ocean Size instead of, ooh, diddy, bop, bop.  And we went, what the fuck are we doing?  This is some real shit.  I'm going to leave it out on that note.  Peace.  All right, listen.  Jay will be back next week.  We've got to wrap up.  Fox Woods.  Fox Woods a week from today.  I'm going, Jay, because next week is a screw-off week. 
[03:54:00]  Screw-off week.  I think we'll even take Friday off so we can make the trip.  If you want me for second chair.  I mean, I've been third chair, but second chair.  Second, third, first, whatever fucking chair.  Since I've been in New York, I've been on YouTube listening to you guys smash each other.  It's so much fun.  Colin and Jimmy getting in a fight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Fights about grace.  I'm walking out with you.  What are you doing?  I've got to go.  I've got to get that audition.  You've got the crooked neck.  Eddie, thank you.  You know this is going to do great for you.  Thanks, though.  Seriously, I appreciate it.  Thank you, Jay.  It really is.  Thanks.  I don't know where you buy it because they're closing all the bookstores, but. 
[03:54:30]  You get Amazon and any bookstores that are left.  You know what?  And this is, you don't have a digital copy of this, right?  Because that would be dumb.  Well, you know what?  They actually talked about.  Well, that's it.  Pictures and shit.  Right, exactly.  I mean, people asked about an audio book, digital this.  You have to have this as a book book.  But it is going to come out electronically down the line.  Eddie, this is my free copy right here?  Yeah, take whatever you want.  That was for Unchained, right, Jay?  That's for Unchained.  If Unchained was in it, it would be no problem.  How about that animal Jericho comes?  Now he's going to Jilly Radio right now. 
[03:55:00]  You're going to be all over him.  And for all the Sam Roberts fans, sorry.  Oh, no, we're still doing a show.  No, you're not.  Yeah, we've got four breaks.  We've still got time.  All right, guys, have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday with some kind of show.  I don't know who's going to be here.  And that's the end of my show.  And maybe Eddie comes back to argue with Van Halen some more.  All right, man.  Thanks, man.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
