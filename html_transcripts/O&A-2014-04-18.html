<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, recapping their 20th-anniversary "Unmasked" live event.  The pre-show extensively covered Scott Shannon's radio persona evolution, playing clips of Opie and Anthony's commentary on his improved demeanor.  Guests at "Unmasked" were discussed, including John Gray (who spoke about a Vegas Ferris wheel) and Valerie Harper (whom Jim Norton relentlessly pursued for a photo).  A significant portion focused on listener calls and anecdotes about Bobo, a caller known for his eccentricities, his attempts to attend "Unmasked" (which he ultimately did, falling asleep during the event), and his mother's involvement.  The pre-show concluded with Sam recounting a staff dinner following "Unmasked" and mentioning upcoming show segments.

The main show opened with Opie and Anthony discussing the success of "Unmasked," its unexpected length, and the positive audience response despite a rushed meet-and-greet. They praised Ronnie Bennington's interviewing and recounted humorous incidents like Mike Tyson's unusual baseball throw.  Tim Sabian's disruptive behavior at the post-show dinner, involving cheesecake-throwing and offensive language, was detailed.  Further discussion included repeated cheesecake smearing on a window by someone named Roland, ribald jokes about Sal's mother's presence at the event and her perceived attractiveness to the show's staff, Iraq's quiet demeanor, Don Wicklin's repeated shouting of "Slobo," and Iraq's blue cheese incident. Jim Norton called in, sharing anecdotes about working with Kiss and taking celebrity photos.  Mars, a staff member, joined, graphically describing a cold sore.  The segment concluded with a debate about Dennis Falcone's dissatisfaction with Sam Roberts' "Unmasked" opening, highlighting contrasting opinions on its effectiveness and Falcone's potential involvement. The conversation was frequently punctuated by crude humor and sexually explicit remarks.


A subsequent segment revisited the "Unmasked" post-mortem, focusing on critiques of Sam Roberts' introduction by Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Dennis Falcone offered a contrasting perspective, advocating for a more energetic opening with music, crowd interaction, and a dramatic host entrance.  He used expletives throughout.  Roberts defended his approach, emphasizing structure and avoiding distractions.  The discussion included playing audio clips of Roberts' intro, debating song choices (like "Start Me Up"), and exploring behind-the-scenes details like poster distribution and the roles of Don Whitman and other staff.  The disagreement between Falcone and Roberts regarding audience engagement remained central, becoming heated and argumentative.


The show included numerous commercial breaks for GoToMeeting, Adam & Eve, New Relic, Power Swabs, TrueCar, Sherry's Berries, BG Products, Famous Smoke, Boyd Brothers, and Steven Singer Jewelers (the latter featuring a sexually suggestive ad with repeated use of "fuck your mom").  A call from Bill Burr followed, discussing his jet-lagged state after a trip to France, including visits to Omaha Beach (detailing the historical significance and German fortifications), Paris, and Saint-Tropez (commenting on wealth and yacht maintenance).  He discussed World War II history, French culture, his upcoming stand-up special, and Patrice O'Neal's death.  His hilariously awkward Sherry's Berries ad read was replayed. Jimmy's lateness and coffee spills were also noted.


A further segment featured a call from Donald Rumsfeld, who jokingly deflected questions about being a lizard person.  Don Wicklin called in to discuss "Unmasked," mentioning cheesecake-throwing. A caller recounted an avalanche experience.  A heated exchange with regular callers Lady Di and Marianne ensued, filled with insults, accusations (lying, drinking, wig-wearing), and threats of violence.  The discussion touched upon "Unmasked" attendees and events. The segment ended abruptly amidst the argument.


Another excerpt involved a highly vulgar and insulting phone call with Lady Di, focusing on a missed event due to a miscommunication with Marion.  The conversation involved profanity, sexually explicit comments, name-calling, and attacks on Lady Di's appearance and habits.  Insults were directed at Bill, including accusations of sexual inadequacy and homosexuality. Bill was put on the phone and participated in the insults. A later caller verbally abused Lady Di.  The hosts made numerous crude jokes throughout.  After the call, the show discussed their Twitter, a Chip Chipperson video, and upcoming "Unmasked" replays. The closing involved banter, ads, an announcement of a tribute show for Otto Peterson (who recently passed), and post-show vulgar discussions with DJ Who Kid and Sam Roberts, including a listener criticizing Sam's recent event performance.  The show ended with more crude jokes and concluding remarks.

[00:03:00]  is like oh great went until 10 15 you get to go home and just have a normal night's sleep no not  us here at the opie and anthony show we got to be up very early to make sure that we're on top of it  to entertain you uh so if you want to be a part of this thing call up now uh we'll talk about what led  up to the unmasked in a moment uh but first scott shannon this whole thing and we tweeted about it  at ona show that we're going to talk about this this morning um the whole one of the great things 
[00:03:30]  and and leading up to the unmasked i think a lot of us were reflecting on some of the stuff that's  happened with opie and anthony and over the last five or six years anyway not the whole 20 but  definitely over the last five or six years jocktober has been a big part of the history of opie and  anthony and a big part of jocktober has always been scott and todd i mean the shots that opie and  anthony took at scott and todd uh are legendary no radio show has gotten hit the way scott and todd have 
[00:04:00]  however the best thing that ever happened to scott shannon from that show was todd wanted to go and  do his own thing so what ends up happening is opie and anthony destroyed todd's show and they they sign  up they're on team scott they're on the bandwagon and scott shannon couldn't be happier um he brought  the show up the other day on his radio show um and also the interesting part in this clip was opie 
[00:04:30]  anthony's reaction to how scott shannon sounded on his new show let's play that from yesterday  that's one of the reasons i came to this radio station i wanted to be at a number one radio station  god that's how it sounds to be reinvented i can't wait it's gonna be great  doesn't he sound he sounds like like a totally different person he sounds like a different guy  like he's happy doesn't he's talking uncomfortably and not he knows he's not trying to shoehorn in 
[00:05:00]  before fucking that fake voice young right machiavellian sneak lying in wait gets him  he doesn't sound like a rock head right at all he was mumbling with todd yeah yeah he's probably  gritting his teeth looking at todd's dumb face ready to go into character bang yeah go ahead  finish up because i gotta talk like that uh sounds very lucid yeah yeah and clear there's something 
[00:05:30]  about that situation that bugs people i think like you when when one guy is like doing that type of  shit like it's not like both of them together i think people just kind of sense that like yeah yeah  let's be fair though we took some brutal shots i mean absolutely i can't sit here and act like a  choir boy yeah but he turned me he completely turned me totally yeah we were on his side before that  before that though because if you had a pick between the two yeah todd that annoyed me much more than  right yeah yeah but man we took some shots and then he comes on our show and he was hilarious 
[00:06:00]  i'm like oh that's why this guy's a legend i get it now that was the first glimpse we got of of the happy  scott the one that like was that we just heard because we for years we were hearing during jocktober  you know  and then he'd just be cut off or you know dummy would start  voice now uh he's amazing and and it is amazing that he sounds like that uh he actually sounds 
[00:06:30]  like he's enjoying his job again and you have to wonder i mean you heard in that clip  obi saying i can't wait when he pointed out that's what it sounds like to be reinvented  you have to wonder if that motivated opi and anthony in their thought process on what the next step  because i mean not only in that clip but the whole idea of doing it on mass the whole idea of  celebrating their 20th anniversary of doing radio together 20 years and they're showing no signs of 
[00:07:00]  slowing down so you wonder if they're figuring out what's next because when you reflect on something  like 20 years in the business doing radio together when you're open anthony and you're not you know  you're not old guys like you're you're ready to keep going they're going to move forward  you know what i mean like and so you and so you wonder what that next step is i see you all on hold 
[00:07:30]  wanting to talk about the unmasked we'll get to you in a moment so please stay on hold if you're on  hold 866-WOW-1-WOW 866-969-1969 i want to uh real quick talk about the guests we had in studio  yesterday john gray stopped by uh john gray he's from vegas and he's the guy who's behind the massive  as opi and anthony called it ferris wheel that we've talked about on the air a couple times and  it really does look amazing uh so he stopped by to kind of talk about the whole deal behind that 
[00:08:00]  let's go to track 11 that's what's smart about is because like if the economy sucks people can't just  go and gamble like my family somewhere so then he can bring him there and just do stuff yeah the  worst is probably just keeping your family in the hotel room yeah right while you go down to the  casino that's not fun for your family and fucking fun for the guy gambling absolutely  i'm going to get college funds got your yap i'm leaving but i would actually go on that and i despise 
[00:08:30]  things like that but it looked like so inviting you know i'd probably be panicked i'm really a buzz  kill on things like that high up but i have to do it you can bring a drink on board i don't drink  oh all right well you know i don't drink you wouldn't want me drunk up there anyway start crying  do they have a contingency plan if somebody maybe drinks a little too much and gets uh sick and you  gotta spray it out oh yeah we got we've lots of you gotta yeah we got more than more than you know  the guy with the squeegee and the hose get in there clean it out i'm assuming there's no rugs right 
[00:09:00]  no yeah they were gonna giant shag rug right now oh god no idea the debauchery that goes on in those  things but i would love in my head i would love to ride the giant vegas ferris wheel but i know  every time i go on those things i realize i'm afraid of heights once i'm on them and i panic and i think  the ride he said lasts a half hour so it may not be the right move for me the other guest that was a  part of the op and anthony show yesterday and this is uh sometimes we have guests on the show that are 
[00:09:30]  not necessarily voluntary i'll say uh because they're standing in the hall and being shouted  at jim at towards the end of yesterday's show saw valerie harper standing in the hallway and  decided show or no show he needs to get a photo and it's funny too because ant talked about this at  the unmasked yesterday that he's never seen anybody so dedicated to a radio show as jim norton and that's  true the fact that he'll go and he'll he'll do a show in los angeles he'll take a red eye and he'll 
[00:10:00]  come back and do the radio show that day like there's very few things that he'll miss a radio show  for but he will leave in the middle of a show to get a celebrity photo that's one thing that jim is  willing to do he did that yesterday um and opie and anthony did everything in their power to stop  the photo from happening as the studio door was wide open and valerie harper was in the hallway 
[00:10:30]  with jim just waiting for his spot i just want to see jimmy try to get this picture he's he's he's  standing there kenny is kenny has the camera by the way he rocks out there with his camera too for  some oh god and now why is what's the matter he's talking to roland jimmy's talking to roland like  like there's a problem or something 
[00:11:00]  here he goes what happened what's the matter jimmy what's going on i'm just waiting for somebody  i don't want to interrupt her she's talking oh you want to help she's gonna be talking until  they walk right into shade or something i'll just take the picture  i love getting them all flustered like he's gonna miss it  kenny you got the camera what are you doing what's going on let's the door closed 
[00:11:30]  why  what are you waiting for just take the picture already  his door's open he's so embarrassed  what's he checking his phone what he's not checking his phone for anything  hey big shot take the picture already  door's open he's so embarrassed 
[00:12:00]  he's he's trying to make it look like he's coolly calmly checking his phone and talking with dom wickland  but oh oh oh it's i think i see some hugs and some uh  wow we're young come on  jimmy's saying no jimmy's basically giving us these these facial expressions like please don't do this  snap it  oh my god 
[00:12:30]  we don't have all day  oh obviously here he goes look look here he goes  he's taking a picture now  and if i could paint the visual  for what's going on the door to the studio is wide open  and valerie harper and jim are  i don't know two yards away from the door itself there's no way  valerie did not hear opie and anthony screaming  uh the other thing that's not on that clip is eric came in after that and jim was pissed 
[00:13:00]  because eric was out there i guess to take jim's photo with the big camera  something happened with the camera  and the picture didn't take and i it's such a stressful situation when you're jim's photographer  i can't i wish that we had video  of eric sitting there hitting the button on the camera and nothing happening  i mean jim must have been livid he stayed by the way  he stayed later after the show after the post show everyone was gone 
[00:13:30]  and waited until valerie harper was done with other stuff  so he could find her and make another attempt he got the photo  i do believe he got the photo all right  let's move into unmasked that went down yesterday everybody's talking about it  it was a it was one of the best live events we've ever done  it was really it was amazing  to see opie and anthony up there  and the way ron interviewed them  it just got their whole story out  i've never i'd i've never known opie and anthony  to do an interview like that together 
[00:14:00]  but i think we were all pleasantly surprised  and i don't even want to say surprised because what do you expect  but it was just pleasant how honest they both were  it really felt like they were being real  and you were being told the real story  unmasked usually goes for 55 minutes or so  this thing went for a little over an hour and a half  and everybody walking out of carolines was saying that  they could have easily sat for four hours  and watch that thing uh let's start going to some calls 
[00:14:30]  um we'll go to mark in jersey what's up mark  how you doing sammy good morning  uh that on that was absolutely incredible by ronnie  uh i must say and it was also fun uh  well actually not so much fun  following the saga of if bobo will go to the event  and unfortunately it just seems like it never ends  because uh there are reports that he actually fell asleep during the event  well that's right there are reports of that  i didn't actually see it happening but  i have seen uh photo evidence 
[00:15:00]  let's go to bart in pennsylvania what's up bart  morning professional broadcaster sam roberts  i'm glad that's transferred over here good morning  hey uh why don't we pull back the curtain a little bit  bobo had a ticket the entire time right or he was  oh no  given a ticket the entire time  i mean look we knew the bobo would show up  and we're not going to look at bobo in the face and tell him he's not  allowed in the building  but he absolutely came to the venue 
[00:15:30]  last night without a ticket  we did not give him a ticket in advance  he did not have a ticket  first of all bobo is not going to pull anything off  so bobo  did not like he wasn't aware that he was getting in  because he can't he can't  perform  do you know what i mean  like if if bobo knew that he had a ticket  you would know  that bobo had a ticket  but no  we had nothing for him  luckily  he showed up  and we could find a seat inside for him 
[00:16:00]  as he was outside  but that's that's  that's how he got in  i'm gonna have to take your word for it sam  of course i don't lie dude  i don't lie to you  i value you bart  i value you too much  and i value our relationship  but boy did bobo try  yesterday on this show  he was calling in  trying to make sure  that he was a part of unmasked  because i mean we heard  we heard marion called the pre-show yesterday  uh to tell opie and anthony  that they were a bunch of fucking assholes  because they wouldn't let her and lady die in 
[00:16:30]  maybe if she and lady die had some persistence  they could have gotten in the way bobo got in  but bobo had persistence  he was calling the show yesterday  he showed up at the venue  uh let's hear bobo's first call into the show  and i say first  because there was more than one  bobo's first call into the show yesterday  i wish you guys happy 20 years  of giving us all great radio  and making us laugh  i've never seen him laugh by the way  no you've never laughed once in our presence 
[00:17:00]  you know that  you look like the manchurian candidate  when you're in here  yeah  then  and i would also like to say that  i'm calling in  based on the suggestion that ronnie b gave me  when i called in in response to what i was tweeting  and they were trying to  they were trying to get people  pair up people that didn't have  a plus one  that sounds complicated  what are you doing 
[00:17:30]  no that time i was trying to  i was trying to tweet that time  i don't know  i don't  i don't really know what you tweet  you start over from the beginning  and by that i mean when the  when the umbilical cord was wrapped  obviously very tightly  by your throat  bobo i love you  but i i i blocked you a long time ago  i had to  yeah  i had to  so i don't even know what you've been tweeting  yeah i haven't even looked at twitter  i don't love you when i block you  well anyway  here's what happened 
[00:18:00]  oh  the twitter account  for the  for the unmasked show  they have a twitter account  and they were trying to ask people to tweet  if they want to be paired up with someone  to fill the extra spots  in case anyone  didn't take anyone  they're plus one  right  i don't think there's going to be any extra spots  plus  i would assume there's going to be a little wine outside carolines  just in case  that shit usually happens  so  why do i  why do i have the feeling he's going to be there anyway  oh he will  of course yes  he's going to just figure this out 
[00:18:30]  he'll figure out how to get in  he won't be there because of me  he's very creative  that's nostradamus shit right there  opie and anthony calling it  that's exactly  what happened  he just showed up at the venue  and weaseled his way in  the way bobo does  uh  but he wasn't giving up  yesterday on the morning show  he wanted approval  from opie and anthony badly  a couple hours later  or probably about one hour later  he called into the show  again  to argue his case  let's go to track 8 
[00:19:00]  this is uh  bobo  bobo i had a ticket for you  i had to give it to the other guy  what happened  right well  well i was just out walking the dog  walking the dog  what dog were you walking  were you doing the yo-yo trick  no  i was walking the dog  i was moving the mr motley again  i see  oh both rosie and mr  well it turned out i had an extra ticket  i gave you  you know  plenty of time to call in and get it  but then this guy  who's from calgary  i said  if bobo doesn't call  i'll give it to you 
[00:19:30]  oh  well thanks  well thanks  well thanks  well thanks  and also  i have to say  i do have to walk my dog  i don't always take the phone  when i walk  oh my god  well obviously this isn't important to you  so  i'll let you go  um  good luck to you  it isn't important  thanks  thanks you guys  i'll see you guys  no  no i don't have the ticket anymore  i gave it to the other guy  i'll see  you guys  i'll see you guys  and uh 
[00:20:00]  he doesn't even acknowledge it  it's like when george costanza quit  right  and then  he just showed up  for his job  great  all right bobo  we gotta let you go  okay  bobs  okay  sorry i did give you a pretty fair shot at it though  yeah  you had a good chance  you just don't really uh  you didn't call up uh  quickly enough  yeah you're just not really showing the passion i guess for this  he uh  he hung up  poor guy 
[00:20:30]  i i honestly um  i don't you know care either way  obviously  but um  he would be  a thousand times better than  than lady die  would be  there  but he's a babbling idiot also  oh god  don't say he's not passionate  do not say bobo's not passionate  because he had another trick up his sleeve  and this was before unmasked  and this was before he showed up outside of carolines 
[00:21:00]  okay  bobo did hang up  but he had a plan  i'll go to your calls about unmasked in just a second  866-WOW-1-WOW  if you want to join in  but before i do  the reason bobo hung up  was because  he had to give the phone to somebody else  he had to give the phone to an advocate  for bobo  someone to uh  fight the good fight  and explain to opie and anthony  why he should be there  or at least butter them up enough 
[00:21:30]  to put him in their good graces  uh  bobo had his mother  his mother  call into the  radio show  yesterday  i'm not  i'm not lying  by the way  if there's any confusion  as to which uh  dog bobo was walking  mr maloonigans  he's a schnoodle  uh let's go to bobo's mom  from yesterday's show  yes  this isn't bobo's day  i know  i'm going to congratulate you guys  on your 20th anniversary  oh  thank you  thank you

[00:24:00]  well bobbo did  and that's  the  the other mystery of bobbo  that we've always wondered is  what is it about the show that he enjoys  we've never seen him laugh  uh  he's got no discernible personality  except he likes to walk his schnoodle  uh  and yesterday  he gets into unmasked  and he falls asleep  which by the  i don't think anybody minded that he fell asleep  because it meant he kept his mouth shut  but  nobody fell asleep at that thing  there was not one moment of boredom  throughout the 90 minute interview  it was  i mean everybody was 
[00:24:30]  captivated  bobbo has to be the one guy  what do you enjoy about the show dude  it's crazy  all right  let's go to some of these calls  uh  fontaine  in virginia  welcome to the pre-show  hey sam what's up buddy  how you doing  talking obi's a puppet master behind that  bobbo shit too  hey sam  you've been around a really long time  and um  a lot of us have watched you mature as a broadcaster  you're a married guy now  yeah  you're the executive producer of a radio show  heard all over the world 
[00:25:00]  that's right  and i know  this is kind of super fan  inside shit  but what the fuck did you eat last night  i love that  i love that fontaine  that means you've been around for a while  and i respect the people that have been around since day one  um  i didn't order off the kids menu  and i thought that that was a big deal  but we did go to a steakhouse  and i did order the chicken  but that's my preference  i don't see why it's such a big deal  it was pointed out  at the dinner table  uh  um  much to my dismay  it wasn't  the choice wasn't complimented 
[00:25:30]  uh  ron bennington had some comments to make about it  anthony cumia  greg olby hughes  all had little comments to make about it  but  i  the chicken is on the menu  okay  if it was an inappropriate thing to order  they wouldn't have it on the menu  right  i did ask them to  give me some french fries instead of rice  because who wants rice  but that's  that's neither here nor there  we're not here to talk about what everybody's meal was  we're here to talk about how great unmasked was  let's go to andrew in jersey  what's up buddy  i just want to say  i didn't fall asleep 
[00:26:00]  during the unmasked  i was meditating  all right  and the unmasked was  was tremendous  it could have been  six to eight hours  i mean  basically  you just scratched the surface  it went by way too fast  and and they did  i mean i was talking to opie a little bit about it  uh  after  the thing went off  and i was talking to a bunch of the fans  all the fans wanted it to go longer  and opie  said the same thing as you  that they barely scratched the surface  they could easily do another  i would say  seven unmasked  unmasked  like a week special 
[00:26:30]  like maybe when they go on vacation  i know it's a lot of work  but  that would be tremendous  like a week special  the history of ona  yeah i get iraq on it  no problem  i have enough to do  i get iraq on it  yeah exactly  he's bored back there  we gotta give him a little more work  thank you andrew  uh  lou in jersey  what's up buddy  ben hey what's going on  how you doing  i met lou i think last night  yes you did  what an event it was  it was unreal  um  i cannot believe that bobo fell asleep  after all that he went through

[00:35:30]  This is the Opie Anthony Show.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Hey.  Welcome.  Yeah, we are.  We're going to have the deep voice today.  We're going to have the deep voice today, that's for sure. 
[00:36:00]  That's the up late.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, up late.  10.30.  That is kind of late for me.  And a couple of drinks.  And a couple of drinks, which is rare for me these days.  A couple of beverages.  A couple of martinis, actually.  I was drinking that nice Chianti.  Yeah.  That was good stuff.  Pretty good stuff.  Oh, I think I'm under the weather.  I think I'm under the weather.  I think I'm under the weather.  Really?  A little bit, yeah.  You've been under the weather all week.  Yeah, a little bit. 
[00:36:30]  Ah, water.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, man, was that fun yesterday.  What a great time.  Really went very well.  A little unmasked.  Out there, live with the hands.  Well, it's obvious.  It's obvious we've got to do another one.  Halfway through it, I stopped panicking.  I'm like, oh, okay.  I know what's going to happen now.  This is going to be broad strokes of the career.  Uh-huh.  And then we've got to do another one, maybe in a few months.  Yeah.  And really just get into, you know, stories. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, details.  Exactly.  We didn't talk about, ah, whatever.  So many things.  So many things.  So many things.  Because I'm, like, called on the pre-show.  What'd they say?  It's like, dude, that could have been six, eight hours.  Six, eight hours.  Imagine sitting for eight hours.  I started laughing when I heard that.  I'm like, what?  We could still be there.  Yeah.  And then.  And then there was 2001.  Right.  Back in 2008. 
[00:37:30]  Nah, we'll do it again, though.  And we'll just do, like, stories.  Sweet.  Because now people know the basic career path.  Yeah.  Man, that was awesome.  It was great, though.  It went off, as they say, without a hitch.  Right.  Ronnie B, just a pisser to be on stage with.  Yeah, he was great.  Yapping with.  Yeah.  Fun.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't even know where to begin.  The fans were amazing.  I know.  They were literally amazing.  I thought our fans were assholes. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  It was kind of nice to see that they were really just amazing.  I think when we control them that much, we, you know, they came in.  They really couldn't do anything too asshole-ish.  No.  Especially during the meet and greet.  Oh, God.  That was my favorite.  See, do we start bitching now?  No, no, no, no, no bitching.  Or do we praise everybody first?  I got to say, you know.  Well, it's just not the way we do things. 
[00:38:30]  No.  We're used to, when we do a live event, we're used to settling in.  Right.  And taking our time.  Yeah, you know it's going to be a while.  Those virus shows, we would have two to three hour signings after the show.  Yep.  One by one.  Talking to everybody.  What's your name?  They come up.  Nice to meet you.  They all get an individual picture.  Pictures.  They, the fans, they had to take group pictures. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I think people took pictures with people they didn't even know.  And they were just being herded, herded, is herded a word?  I don't even know.  Yeah, sure.  Today it is.  And they were just getting pushed through very quickly.  Very fast.  To the point we just started laughing.  We were embarrassed.  Because the line just kept moving.  It didn't stop.  Right.  And they were like, how are you doing?  It was literally a quick handshake.  Right.  They turned around.  We smiled.  The flash went off of the camera.  And off they went. 
[00:39:30]  Or they were chased away by Kenny.  Well, they had, no, not even Kenny.  It was, yeah, the photographer guy.  The SiriusXM people have done a lot of those.  They're very organized.  And they were like, all right, thank you.  Next.  Look at the camera.  Look at the camera.  Okay, good.  Move on.  Next.  And we're just going, what?  And people were like, but, but, but.  Yeah.  All confused.  They had three seconds.  Yeah.  I was telling people, I hope you enjoyed your three seconds.  Your three seconds with us.  It was literally three seconds.  Yeah.  I was kind of embarrassed. 
[00:40:00]  It was.  By that part.  It was so ridiculous.  Leave your luggage here.  It will be brought to you at the family camp.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Wow.  Jimmy kept going, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  They rushed them through.  We had nothing to do with that.  The funniest.  I know we pre-signed the posters, but I thought, I thought everyone would at least get an individual  shot.  For a picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no.  But no.  Yeah.  It was great.  Jimmy was making fun of the whole thing.  It's like, what was it?  Somebody walks up, dude, you got me through when I, I had cancer and I, all right, yeah, 
[00:40:30]  goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Dude, my father died and you know, you were there for, all right, all right, move on,  move on.  Yeah.  My kids really said, sorry to hear, God bless.  Oh, shit.  But they were under a little time constraint.  But it went, the crowd was, everything was well done, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really, really well done.  It really was a great event.  Sirius XM put on a great event.  Don Wicklund did a great job organizing.  Don Wicklund.  Comes out the hero, I think.  When all's said and done. 
[00:41:00]  Tim Sabian, whatever he does.  Holy shit.  He's a fucking lunatic.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  Out of control.  Oh, my God.  He's really, he's the one that's now in control of this channel?  He had to be watched.  Seriously?  He had to be watched.  And we didn't watch him too good.  I had to plop down right next to him at dinner.  Right next to him.  I think you wanted to do that.  No, I really didn't.  But I think you could smell your fellow alcoholics.  You sniffed out a fellow drunk.  Because, boy, is he a problem. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Find the guy worse than you and sit next to him.  Boy, is he a problem.  Yeah.  Wow.  He might want to get some things under control.  Shh.  Did you give away all the punchlines during the pre-show, Sam?  Oh.  Did you leave anything for us?  Yeah.  I left a lot for you.  Not really.  You talked about Bobo sleeping.  That was a big, you know, that's a big headline.  Everybody was talking about that.  I didn't talk about anything that the fans didn't already know.  Did you talk about the...  No, I didn't talk about anything.  I mentioned we went to a dinner. 
[00:42:00]  Okay, okay.  Went to dinner and you had chicken.  Why did I mention I had chicken?  At the steak place, yeah.  You got to see Tyson throwing a baseball.  Yeah.  It just happened on TV.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know what the hell that was.  Really?  We're going to see Tyson tomorrow.  We got invited to a really cool event.  Yeah.  He can't throw a baseball.  I don't know what that was.  It looked like a knuckleball.  Yeah.  You got to see this.  Is it online?  I mean, was it bad?  It looked bad?  I don't know.  I don't know if it was bad. 
[00:42:30]  You sure he threw it?  He probably just punched it.  Was he thrown out the first pitch somewhere?  Yeah, for the Pirates.  And he made it all the way to home plate, and it looked like he pretty much threw a strike,  but his form was really weird.  And then it floated like a knuckleball or something.  You got to show these guys this freaking throw.  Oh, here it is.  Is this going to be it?  Tony Sanchez is telling the story about...  I don't need the long-form video.  Pirates.  Is anyone a Pirates fan? 
[00:43:00]  There he goes.  All right, watch this.  Oh, here we go.  Tony Sanchez here, and of course, Tyson has done that.  I don't know that Evander Holyfield thought it was so funny.  Wow.  What was that?  That was an arcing fucking knuckleball, yeah.  Here, and of course, Tyson has done that.  That was...  Is that the weirdest throw you've ever seen?  He really snapped his arm.  Yeah.  I don't know what the hell that was, but he got it done.  He threw almost a perfect strike.  Right.  Wow.  That really arced.  But it was like a cartoon pitch or something.  You see the power in his arm, though? 
[00:43:30]  He did that like, wah!  Oh, yeah.  Like a punch, yeah.  Yeah, it was all...  It was like all forearm to get it there.  He's a big guy.  Yeah.  He's ridiculous.  He's so cool, too.  Yeah.  He personally invited us to this thing tomorrow.  I'm flattered.  Personally.  He kind of likes us.  Yeah.  Anyway.  I'm going to shove him in.  Are you?  Yeah.  You're going to punch him?  Yeah.  What?  Hit him?  Smack him.  Bitch smack him in the face.  No, just poke him.  Just poke him.  Hey.  Hey, you.  If our seats aren't satisfactory.  Right.  Oh, God. 
[00:44:00]  So, how long was the Unmasked?  An hour and 40 minutes?  Just about, yeah.  Almost.  Yeah, it was supposed to be just an hour.  They told us last minute when you could go longer, so we're like, okay.  Yeah.  Because I was watching the clock with Ronnie.  I kept leaning over.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Yeah, when we really started getting into it, I'm thinking, oh, fuck, man.  Are we done in like five minutes?  Right.  Yeah.  So, I want to thank everyone for coming out and enjoying themselves.  It was really nice.  Yeah, everybody seemed to have.  Have a good time?  Despite the disastrous opening. 
[00:44:30]  Like, before Ronnie and you guys came out, I didn't know what happened.  There was something happening.  It was terrible.  The person on stage?  Oh, oh.  Do we have that clip?  Oh, we do?  Were you telling people not to take pictures?  Yes.  Why?  Did they tell you that?  Because we don't want to.  We don't want distractions.  We're doing that now.  More exclusive stuff?  What is it, the King Kong display?  No pictures now.  You'll startle the ape.  They're not going to listen to you.  They did. 
[00:45:00]  Nobody took photos.  I've seen photos all over the place.  Well, nobody.  When you were up on stage, though, did you see a bunch of phones pointed at you?  I saw a lot of sneaky sneaks.  Maybe some sneaky sneaks.  Did someone tell you that?  Sneaky sneaks.  Or did you just decide to tell people not to take pictures?  You heard that?  It wasn't my decision.  Oh.  Who told you?  Tim Sabian?  Those that organized the event.  Don Wicklund?  He was in support of my statements.  I think Sam just said it, and then they said, yeah, good job.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Make up the rules.  I think you did.  We don't like...  We need some rules.  I need to get up there.  We don't like polished events.  No, I don't.  We don't like limited edition posters.  We don't like telling the audience they can't take pictures.  We don't like them being shuffled out after 2.4 seconds.  God.  We don't like that they had to take their picture with strangers just to make the line go faster.  That should have been an individual picture for every single person.  It would have been a drag, but...  Is that what happened? 
[00:46:00]  That's why there was groups.  Yeah, sometimes there was two people up there that didn't even know each other.  I didn't know that.  I didn't either.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were kind of just grouping them as they went.  It's like you, you, and you.  Go.  Okay, done.  Bye.  You, and you, and let's take you over there.  So did somebody get a photo with you guys and Bobo?  He was alone.  Bobo was alone.  Oh, he got the individual shot.  He got the VIP tree.  Oh, good for him, then.  I didn't know he fell asleep.  Yes.  How great is that?  How long did he sleep?  That I don't know. 
[00:46:30]  But I do know that he was...  Yeah, what?  Big A took a picture of him.  Really?  Sleeping.  Of course, Big A had his spy phone out.  Of course.  Yeah.  I'm speaking up.  After all that, he's sleeping?  He's sleeping.  Look at him.  Look at him asleep.  Oh, my God.  As everyone else is laughing around him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Great shot.  People laughing.  So it's no indication that we're boring the audience.  Because, look, you can see people laughing.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  And all around him.  And Bobo is snoozing right there.  I want to go on record and say Bobo got his ticket, but we had nothing to do with this.  I don't know how he got in.  Does anyone know how he figured it out finally?  Well, he showed up like you predicted he would.  Uh-huh.  And he was lingering outside Caroline's.  And then I think he just ran into, it wasn't me, I don't know exactly who it was, but it  was somebody who works for one of the shows that I guess felt bad for him, like we thought,  and let him in. 
[00:47:30]  But he was, yeah, there was people that had the plus one.  Yes.  That just came by themselves and gave other people their plus one.  So I guess that's how he got in.  Right.  He was spoken to, by the way.  Everybody, once people realized he was there, no less than five people who were working at  the event went up and spoke to him to ensure that he would not open that mouth of his.  He probably, out of self-preservation, fell asleep. 
[00:48:00]  Like, I know I can't not talk, so I'll fall asleep.  He was fine.  He was well.  Yeah, he was fine.  He was very nice.  Let's go to Chris in Connecticut.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  Last night, it was a really good listening experience, I'll have to say, first off.  And I'm not trying to start anything, I just want to clear something up.  Last night, you guys, in the past, you said you were off for two years because of something  in your contract about the Howard clause or whatever. 
[00:48:30]  And last night, you had said that you were off for two years because they didn't stop paying  you.  It's the same thing.  First of all, what's the Howard clause?  I mean, the event went by so fast that it was hard to really dig in and give details  on stories.  They technically fired us, but they paid us because they didn't want us going anywhere 
[00:49:00]  else because they knew we were going to compete against Howard.  And like Ant said, would we have beaten Howard back then?  Probably not.  But we would have taken a nice chunk out of his audience because we were on top of our  game.  Right.  But then that offer quickly went away the longer we sat.  Yep.  And then Clear Channel had to move on and do something else.  It's called pay or play, sir.  Right.  Where the show is canceled and the clause in the contract is we can put you on the air 
[00:49:30]  or we can sit you as long as we're paying you.  So technically we were fired, but they still controlled us.  Yep.  Right.  I understand that.  I just thought maybe I misunderstood then because I thought I heard in the past that  there was something specifically in your contract that said you couldn't go on another radio  station and mention Howard and that's why you didn't.  Oh, no.  You're mixing up a whole bunch of things.  Oh, and I don't think.  No. 
[00:50:00]  When we were, before we got fired, we were working for the same company as Howard Stern  and the company insisted that we don't mention his name.  It was never even in a contract or anything like that.  They sat us down with memos and lawyers and all sorts of shit and demanded that we stop  talking about Howard Stern.  And they would just dump out of it down the hall.  Yeah, exactly.  And then we, of course, we refused and we continued to do it.  And then we came up with radio edits so we could still talk about it.  All right.  And then we couldn't say radio edit.  And then they said you can't say radio edit anymore. 
[00:50:30]  And then they finally just started dumping out of every mention.  Do you remember?  That is the truth.  Do you remember the lawyer?  That came directly from Howard Stern, by the way.  The lawyer was Howard K. Stern on the, what was her name, Ann Nicole Smith?  Right.  Show.  And that was a problem because you were talking about the show legitimately, but you couldn't  say the name.  It was something.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  Well, then I'm an asshole and it's completely my bad.  No, I think that's, I think that's why we got to do another on mass.  You know, there's, there's a nice broad stroke story told last night and now we can dig into  some, you know, specifics, specific, uh, stories. 
[00:51:00]  So it was really good.  And I think it was better that it was in a smaller venue like that, uh, because it seemed  a lot more intimate.  It worked out perfectly.  Yeah.  I mean, as much as we bitch, it's boring to show this side.  But I'll say it, it worked out perfectly.  Yeah.  It's much more fun to beat up Don Wicklin and Tim Sabian and the company.  But the fact is, it was a great event and it was well organized and they really know 
[00:51:30]  how to throw an event, uh, Sirius XM.  Yeah.  And our people around us know how to organize it in, in, in a way that makes it, uh, you  know, fun for everyone.  Can I say one more thing before I hang out?  Um, Tim, uh, ask Tim Sabian about taking the shit all over the walls at Howard 100.  Yeah.  I've only heard like bits and pieces of that.  I'm going to go.  Somebody was kind of giving me a little more details on that.  Yeah.  About what?  Tim Sabian shitting all over the walls. 
[00:52:00]  Like literally?  I don't know how you do that.  Like, I wouldn't doubt it after hanging out with Tim a few times.  Uh, he's out of control.  He said he was, he said he was sick and he ran in there real fast and couldn't get his  pants off fast enough and basically pulled his pants down and just sprayed shit freckles  all over the place.  Every once in a while we come in here and, and the public bathroom, there's, that is  all over the, right?  Yeah.  I've taken pictures over the, over the years.  I don't understand how you could have explosive diarrhea to the point where you're hitting 
[00:52:30]  walls and stuff.  Can't get those pants down quick enough.  That doesn't make sense to me.  Do you think he has, um, weak sphincter muscles?  Yeah.  Yeah.  From overuse.  No, there's something called, uh, not colitis, but there's something a friend of mine has.  Oh.  Carital bowel syndrome?  Yeah, maybe like one of those where you like, where he had like this guy, Dennis, I know  when he has to shit, he has to shit and he'll pull over and just shit on the side of the  road if he has shit.  So you're bending down as you're getting your pants.  Right.  And getting ready to sit back. 
[00:53:00]  It rockets out.  And then it rockets out and hits the back wall and the sides and stuff.  I don't, I don't understand.  I have good duty control.  Maybe some people don't.  We did have a guy in our fraternity that, uh, would, would, would spray.  Really?  A sprayer?  He, he was a sprayer.  Like a skunk.  He ruined one of our couches.  Oh God, a couch?  Yeah.  That's not even close to the bathroom.  That's wrong.  Thank you.  But he ruined one of our couches.  I will not name him here because he might be a, he might be a fine citizen now, Jerry. 
[00:53:30]  Anyway, uh, Chris, thank you.  I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope that cleared it up.  But, uh, you know, this is a, a great, uh, example of, you know, we probably need to do  another one and dig into some stories a little deeper.  Yeah.  I also think Caralives is great because it's a great live venue because they're used to  doing audio stuff there.  Yes.  And the sound there is perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was really good.  Well, thanks for being a call, guys.  I'm going to go back to work.  All right, Chris, thanks.  Yeah, you do that.  That was, that was really great, man.  Really fucking great. 
[00:54:00]  God damn, that, that Tim is just.  Is he a wild man?  Out of control.  Well, well, at dinner, um, I had a plop down next to him, you know, and, uh, you guys were  having a good old time.  What a great time, huh?  He was.  Oh, thank you.  First, like he starts kissing people.  He's just kissing everybody.  He's one of those guys.  He was, he was excited.  He was very excited.  Right.  Hope he's just blatantly saying fuck you to him. 
[00:54:30]  Oh my God.  Yeah.  That was fucking.  Yeah.  Like he was getting up to, you know,  use the bathroom or talk to somebody else or something.  And Tim be like, Hey, I'll be, blah, blah, blah.  You say something.  I'll be just turned around and goes, Hey, fuck you.  He knows I love him.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  We go way back.  We've had our ups and downs.  And then at the end of the night, I had a couple of me too, which is rare.  At the end of the night.  I had a couple of faggy, uh, martini.  Martini.  Tim decided it was a good idea.  We were in a private room, a huge table in the middle. 
[00:55:00]  Del Frisco.  A great restaurant.  They should get a plug today.  They're an amazing restaurant.  They have amazing food down there.  And, uh, we were in a room.  It was beautiful.  Nice big table, uh, in a private room.  And the, the, the walls of the room were actually glass.  Right.  That showed part of the wine cellar.  Right.  That was behind the glass.  Right.  It was really nice.  Uh, Tim decided at the end of the night, he was going to take a handful of his cheesecake  that was in front of him. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  And wail it against the window.  This was his out.  This was his, well, this was a great night.  And then whammo.  And then leaves.  Thank you.  Is there pictures of this?  Were you guys still here after he did that?  I saw it.  I was there.  Yeah.  I saw it.  I was there.  Oh, my God.  Is there pictures?  He, I, did he rock post the pictures?  I don't know if he posted it.  I didn't want to post the pictures.  It happened.  I missed that.  And, uh, he wailed it off.  Oh, sorry.  I just want to say, go to O and A show on Twitter. 
[00:56:00]  There's a ton of pictures from unmasked.  And hopefully Eric will add the, uh, the cheesecake picture.  I was just cracking the fuck up.  It was so goddamn funny.  It was hilarious.  But we were trying to have a gentleman's dinner.  A real, this was a nice place.  This wasn't fucking 3 a.m. at Taco Bell or, uh, you know, Jack in the Box after a night  of drinking.  No.  It's a nice restaurant.  It's a hard one to get into last minute, too.  Right?  It's not easy to get into.  Especially that private room.  It was beautiful.  Uh, he should have yelled, World Star Hip Hop!  Yeah, World Star! 
[00:56:30]  And then, of course, after he does it, the children.  You ever do something as an adult, uh, that, that, that, that the children see and take  it as an example and do the same thing?  Yes, I have!  Oh, no, Uncle Paul.  Well, the children decided, and by that I mean Roland, that if Tim Sabian did it, he  could do it and threw, threw some of his cake against the wall.  Now we gotta apologize to Del Frisco. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know why he did this.  In the end, it was the Opie and Anthony crew.  Yeah.  So they're talking about us today, like these animals were, were throwing cheesecake, uh,  against a glass wall.  A piece of cheesecake hit one of the nice paintings that were on the wall.  There's a painting down there?  Yeah, there, yeah.  And they're blaming Opie and Anthony.  Of course!  They don't realize it's the boss and the booker.  Of course!  Right, right, right.  It was, uh...  I gotta see the picture.  It was quite a scene.  It was pretty funny.  It was hilarious.  It's a good out.  Thank you, good night. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  Great night, see you guys tomorrow.  Whop!  Whop!  Right.  Can you imagine if that window would have broke?  Oh!  It would have been great.  Oh, man.  It whizzed right by Troy's head.  Yes.  Like, it almost messed up his bouffant.  Almost hit Troy's wonderful head of hair.  Yeah.  He's gonna be back on this show sooner than later.  Hmm.  We almost got that figured out.  Ah, oh.  Yes.  So...  That was, uh, that was good.  And then, um, I guess Tim also... 
[00:58:00]  Oh, he read the, uh, Scott Greenstein email congratulating, uh, everybody for a job well  done.  Well...  That was nice.  That was good.  Great job.  Thanks.  That was it.  The end.  And Greenstein wonders why we make fun of him.  And you wonder why we make fun of you, and you get mad at us.  It's a nice rant.  It could have used a little more.  I think we created a nice little buzz for the company in the last few days.  The Unmask was perfect.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  Great event.  And Tim actually reached out to Scott Greenstein with actual audio from the event going, wow,  this is, uh, going great.  Just want to, you know, let you in on this and let you know about it.  Here's a little clip.  And what he gets back from Scott Greenstein is, great, thanks.  Thanks.  You'll never be able to trace an email from Scott and get information out of it.  He's...  No.  That's the lawyer in him.  Yes.  Because I've gotten emails from him.  I've written them, like, look, I got a blah, blah, blah, blah.  And he goes, okay, get on it.  That's it? 
[00:59:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Two letters.  Oh, boy, does he not give it up in the email?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's all we got from him this week.  That's it.  There you go.  The main guy.  The main programming guy here.  That's a compliment.  That's all we got.  No picture of the cheesecake incident?  I don't know why it's not...  Was he rock afraid, maybe, to put it up?  He definitely didn't put it up yet.  He didn't want to rat him out?  The bosses have said to put it up.  Wait, I thought there were a lot of pictures from Unmasked.  They're posting them now, as we go, because there was no service in the venue. 
[00:59:30]  So we couldn't post as we went last night.  Oh.  Oh.  Sal's in the office, posting a whole bunch of pictures.  Sal's mom.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Sal's mom.  How lovely.  Who might be younger than most of the...  I don't know what was her.  She's two years older than me, dude.  Two years older than me.  I mean, she's four years older than me.  She was quite a...  Do you got the cheesecake pictures?  Look at him. 
[01:00:00]  What is...  Is it four pictures?  I don't understand.  No, it's two.  So there's the first one.  That's cheesecake on the window.  And then he was smearing it on the window, trying to, like, act like he was cleaning it off.  But then it was, like, all smeared up.  And he was like, fuck it.  Yeah, fuck it.  And he left.  Did people come in and go, why is there cake on the window?  I don't know.  Is it an adult restaurant?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, they were looking for a high chair.  There has to be a child here.  What happened?  And that was, like, the one, like, oh, that was crazy.  And then you're right. 
[01:00:30]  Roland took his time to, like, do it, like, six more times after that.  I know, because Roland...  Look at that!  He saw it.  He saw it and had to throw it himself.  Right.  Fucking children.  All right.  Great time, though.  Yeah, but Sal's mom, you were saying.  She's quite the looker.  I get vibes from her.  Yeah, we all were getting vibes from her.  Oh, man, right?  Any pictures?  I got some vibes. 
[01:01:00]  Sal is hating this right now.  He knows.  There is Sal.  We want to talk about how hot his mom is.  We've brought it up to him many times.  Oh, you've seen it before?  Yeah, we met her at the Patrice Benefit.  And that's when, I think that's when Troy and myself started arguing over who gets first  dibs.  First dibs?  Yeah.  I said Troy would have that easily.  Oh, yeah.  And then everybody kind of got involved in the first dibs argument after last night.  That's kind of flattering, though.  I think so. 
[01:01:30]  It's compliments.  She would pick Troy.  Oh, here he is.  I'd be okay with that.  Oh, Sal.  Your mom's hot.  Sal's mom.  Wow.  Did she have a good time?  She loved it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She loves you guys.  I bet she did.  Whoa.  Who would she have sex with here?  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know.  How about, I mean, how about you just guess?  Just don't say sway.  Who would she have sex with?  I don't know.  It's a situation with Troy Kwan, obviously.  No.  I don't think that's her type. 
[01:02:00]  Who's her type, you think?  Yeah, why would she like him shape and good-looking Troy Kwan?  I really don't know.  Jim thinks she might have been given to him vibes.  I got vibes.  You got vibes from my mom.  Yeah.  We took the picture.  She just sneaked right in there.  She gave me a little hip-hop.  Oh, I just thought you'd pick up vibes pretty well.  Give me some vibes.  Nice.  She was giving me the, if he wasn't here.  She came over, I absolutely thought, sister, something like that, or cousin, relative.  And then it's like, oh, it's my mom. 
[01:02:30]  It's like, oh, man.  How did that happen?  Oh, my God.  Who was she with?  That's my uncle.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He's the fishing guy.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, we're going to go fishing.  Yeah.  I'm going to go fishing with Sal's uncle.  My uncle's the best.  Did he touch you?  No.  No.  All right.  And he's...  Your mom's not the best?  Your uncle's the best?  Well, I mean, like, my...  My mom's the best.  You said your uncle's the best.  Yeah, he is.  I would have probably said my mom's the best.  My mom is the best.  In that situation.  But, yeah, like, when my parents...  Do you hate how hot she is?  I didn't even...  There's something that never even crossed my mind. 
[01:03:00]  You guys are making me so fucking flustered.  You saw her, you know.  All right.  I don't want...  She's a nice rump.  You're talking about that ass?  Really nice rump.  It's nice.  Oh, God.  You guys...  As Otto would have said, she had a nice turd cutter.  Oh.  Got a nice smile.  Oh.  Those eyes.  Yup.  Yup.  She's down.  You could tell.  You think she's down?  Yeah.  First date in the car.  I know what he's talking about, right?  Yeah, I got it.  Oh, fucking Sal.  What's your thoughts on last night, Sal? 
[01:03:30]  It was great.  It was...  Ronnie B did a fantastic job, and I do wish it was longer.  I know everyone's saying that, but...  Yeah.  I wish your mom wasn't there distracting the staff from the show.  Oh.  You want to call her?  You want to see who she would?  Yeah, we'll call her in a little bit.  All right.  Yeah.  We can do that.  We got to fill up time today.  Let her speak for herself.  Get them digits.  That's right.  But she turned me on to you guys way back in the day.  She did.  Oh, she's the fan.  Yes.  Wow.  Yes.  No kidding.  I used to listen to you guys on NEW with her. 
[01:04:00]  How old were you?  I was really on listening to the crazy shit you guys used to do.  How old?  I don't know.  Fucking 10, maybe.  Oh, my God.  Did you have a beard then, too?  Yeah.  That's so weird that she turned you on to them, and now they're going to turn her on.  Oh, see?  See what he did there?  Plant words.  Oh, yes.  Do we have any clips from last night?  Yeah, we should.  All right.  So dinner was fun, right?  Oh, dinner was fantastic. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  You saw Tim Sabian throw the cheesecake?  That was fucking hysterical.  Throwing of the cheesecake.  I got to take a shit.  And then he fucking throws it.  Yeah.  It's hysterical if you're not Opie Anthony or Jim Norton.  Right.  Because our names are...  No one will link Jim Norton to that one.  Our names are attached to that fucking cake.  Absolutely.  And then the party next door, they were singing Happy Birthday, and then everyone just got  even louder in our room.  Yeah, yeah.  Tim is just out of fucking control.  And Don was having fun, too. 
[01:05:00]  Donnie was having fun.  Don was dropping beverages.  A few Slabos here and there.  Slabos.  Oh, was he really?  Oh, yeah.  Poor Iraq was like...  He was at the other end of the table from the cool kids at the table, and the cool kids  were all just making fun of him and flipping him the bird.  And everybody was watching what he was ordering.  What he was eating.  This is going to suck.  Remember you ordered the Slumfest?  Huh?  He had the chocolate milk.  Like, oh, Jesus.  Did he have chocolate milk?  Backstage in the green room at Caroline's, a bunch of food gets delivered back there. 
[01:05:30]  Pizza and fucking some hot wings and french fries, all kinds of stuff.  And then, you know, in with the buffalo wings, you get like the carrots and celery and  stuff.  Iraq comes back.  He looks and goes, oh, let me just take a carrot.  I was like, Iraq, don't.  Just stop.  Why would you?  You're not fooling anyone.  What?  I like...  Did you see this?  What?  What is that?  This?  You didn't see what this is?  What?  The blue cheese on the rug of the green room.  When we saw Iraq come in and take one carrot and scoop it in blue cheese, and he splattered 
[01:06:00]  it all over the rug.  And you took a pink splatter.  Of course I did.  This is a big, a pink splatter.  You're not eating healthy if you dip your vegetables into blue cheese.  What?  Kenny's got something?  Kenny was...  Kenny had some opinions on Sal's mom.  Oh.  No, I just think Sal's mom is good to go. 
[01:06:30]  You think she's good to go?  Yeah.  Is she a single mom?  No.  Raising a hipster?  No.  She's a single mom raising a hipster.  Would you be embarrassed if she hooked up with Kenny in the bathroom?  Oh, God.  Believe me, she was wet last night.  Jesus.  Kenny?  Did you see what she was wearing?  But the kid might be connected.  You've got to be careful.  Geez, I don't even know about the dad portion of this.  All right.  Was he there?  That's the funniest part.  She's happily married still.  She went out alone, though.  She shops at Victoria's Secrets, you could tell. 
[01:07:00]  Oh.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Victoria's Secrets?  You could tell, Sal.  Wow, really?  Oh, yeah.  Nice lacy lingerie.  She shops at Frederick's of Hollywood.  Closed for fucking years.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Did you see Tim Sabian throw the cheesecake?  Yes, I did.  Did you think that was professional?  Who am I to say?  It just was so wrong.  It was a fun night.  And we're saying that. 
[01:07:30]  It was just wrong.  Yeah.  Tim does like having a good time, though.  Boy, does he.  Yeah.  Kissing everybody.  When he got up and started kissing everybody.  It was nice.  Wow.  Was it nice?  I wish our old management would have kissed us more.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you think Steve Blatter would have kissed everybody?  It's a team building exercise.  Kiss everybody.  Steve would have done it, but he would have gently cupped your chin and eye contact with  you first.  With some tongue.  Oh, yeah.  Mouth to mouth.  He would have Frenched everybody.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Frencher.  Sal's mom is good eats.  What?  Good eats.  He's right there.  He's right here.  Oh, that's complimentary.  That's a compliment.  Yeah.  No one's saying how hot my mom is.  Who would you least like to have your mom sleep with on this task?  Oh, that's a good question.  Probably Kenny.  Wow.  Why Kenny?  Why?  Because Kenny's big.  He's probably got like a ridiculous piece in it.  No.  It's obvious he doesn't.  I would give it to a real good.  Oh, my God. 
[01:08:30]  Real good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would put effort into it.  Holy shit.  Did you hear him sound?  Yeah, I heard him, Sam.  I definitely heard him.  I don't know.  I don't know why would it be Kenny, because I don't think you're going to, she's going  to get a lot of like, like new, fun, active shit from Kenny.  I think it's going to be a straight, straight ahead fucking.  Pump and Dump. 
[01:09:00]  Sal.  Sal, you know what MILF stands for?  Oh.  Mom, I'd like to fuck.  All right.  It's Kenny.  Of course he knew that.  Everyone knows that.  He says it like it's new.  Two inches from his face, though.  You know what LOL means?  All right.  So you'd rather have Troy be your mom than Kenny?  Yeah.  Because that would be like an adventurous fucking.  Yeah, I mean, Troy would bend her up every which way.  Make her do things she doesn't really want to do.  She's into positions. 
[01:09:30]  She is?  Oh, yeah.  I don't fucking think about this stuff at all.  Why would you?  You better start thinking about it.  I know.  It seems like I have to now.  What if Iraq vengaged?  No, that would never happen.  What?  What do you mean by what if?  Like, how would you feel?  I don't know.  I'd have him taken care of.  You know what I mean?  You'd have Iraq killed.  Take care of.  That means you'd just have someone build a big flight of steps in front of Iraq's house.  He'd never get home.  For Iraq, he was just sitting at that table getting abused. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, unshaven.  He's very quiet.  He was.  He doesn't socialize well.  Yeah, and one thing he didn't enjoy, though, was the fact that Don Wicklin, every 25 minutes or so, felt the need to randomly shout,  Slobo.  Slobo.  He doesn't like that.  No, no, he doesn't.  Anything he said was fodder for today.  Iraq knows anything he says. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, he chose every word very carefully to try to protect himself from today's show.  Because he knew.  Here comes Iraq now.  Oh, here he is.  Eric didn't eat any desserts.  He's not a big dessert guy.  He doesn't like sweets.  We know Iraq's not a big dessert guy.  He's not a dessert guy.  He likes it.  He liked his chunk of meat.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone's steak was great, and, of course, the child's chicken was very nice.  It was on the menu.  Yeah, it was on the menu.  Who gets chicken at an amazing steakhouse like that? 
[01:11:00]  The selection of different types of steaks.  They were done perfectly.  I'd like to ask for it.  I went to Smith & Walensky earlier this week and got the chicken.  Sal, your mom likes meat, right?  What kind of steak does she like, Kenny?  The tube steak, right?  I'll say.  Oh, jeez.  How come your mom didn't come to the dinner?  That would have been fun.  Yeah.  Because I anticipated this was going on during the show.  So I was like, all right, I'll see you guys later.  Go ahead.  Go home.  You pushed him out.  That's not nice. 
[01:11:30]  I mean, she's been a fan forever.  She could have ate with us.  Frank and Queens.  Frank and Queens.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's going on?  Any hot dogs with a chicken?  Dude, what are you waiting for?  Wow.  Why?  Sal?  Because it's just, it's fucking funny at the end of the day.  Like, it doesn't matter.  At the end of the day?  It's the beginning of the day.  Yes.  Or early.  Yeah, we're not fans of the end of the day.  I like this guy Italian, Sham.  Yeah.  And Sham, by the way, the past few days, you've been nothing but a twat with the posters and 
[01:12:00]  everything else.  Wow.  Thank you, Frank.  Wow.  Thank you.  What?  Sorry.  Sorry to disappoint you, Frank.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Frank.  Go have a calzone now.  It's racist, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  We're going to take a break.  Just getting started.  We've got a few clips.  A few moments from the Unmasked.  And building as we go.  It was very fun.  Huh?  We're building clips as we go.  We should start with the thrill that was the opener. 
[01:12:30]  We should probably start with a clip from the...  I mean, it wasn't aired.  There's no reason to...  What?  We got it, though.  It wasn't aired.  You mean everyone missed out on that?  It was referenced all night long, so we've got to play it for everybody.  Got them crazy.  Just something for the live audience.  Live.  Well, we're going to play that.  We'll play a few clips.  And we're going to eat now.  All right.  All right.  Opie and Anthony will be right back.  Stay tuned so they don't make fun of your mother.

Okay, Lyle, you're requesting placement in witness protection. 
[01:21:00]  What kind of information do you have for us?  Yo, I'm in the mafia. Don't even fuck around with me.  Don't get defensive. Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was Lil' Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle, you have no record.  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts.  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with? 
[01:21:30]  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  Yeah, good luck killing me. I carry like fucking bazookas.  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that.  If you're just here to waste my time, I suggest you leave.  Fuck you, cocksucker. I'd shoot and kill everybody.  Bury in a hole or something, then we'll see.  Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?  Fucking stupid cocksucker.  Start listening, you fucking piece of shit.  Nate, I can't believe you wasted our fucking time with this bullshit. 
[01:22:00]  Do you know this is a crime?  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, Lyle?  Walk out the door now.  Fuck you.  You're a funny guy.  Laugh at this.  You like that?  How does this feel?  Fuck this.  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and Antity Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, we're back.  Sort of.  Ant's in the bathroom.  Jimmy's down the hall.  He's going to be on Scott Shannon, right?  Here in New York City?  Yes.  Can I pop the feed up?  Yeah, he's just playing music right now.  Ah, yeah.  Nice.  Scott Shannon in the morning.  CBS, ha ha! 
[01:23:00]  That's pretty cool that Jimmy's going to be on with him.  It's very strange based on where we've come from with Scott Shannon.  I heard you talking about that on the pre-show.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing, Lyle?  Yeah.  We beat the crap out of him for years.  But I love it because the fact that we're now friends with Scott is even a bigger shit  on Todd than ever before.  Me and him are going to dinner soon.  You and Scott Shannon?  Yep. 
[01:23:30]  And I'm going to do a little time on this show soon, too.  Wow.  I don't know how that worked out.  We're talking about Scott Shannon and how we completely flipped that thing.  Are you going to do the tree on the house thing when you're on this show?  Oh, hell yeah.  Right to his face.  Good for you.  You should order, like, broccoli when you're out and just make it like, hey, I got a tree  on my house.  And be like, oh, I get it.  I get it.  Oh, he's cool with it.  I get it.  What are you going to do, man?  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to be on Scott Shannon's show. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  And this is what they're playing right now.  Look how nice this is.  Woo.  It's all up.  Music.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  You go for years, like, doing music radio, trying to break through, stretching your talk  breaks.  You're like, we don't play this music.  Da, da, da.  What?  And then once you actually start talking and get into it for a few years, all you want  to do is start playing music again.  That's a cold ending right there. 
[01:24:30]  Do you know this one?  Yeah.  Who is this again?  CBS FM.  Oh.  Oh.  Might actually be the best day of my life.  What's the chances of that happening on Good Friday?  Oh, that's wonderful.  Oh.  7.22, ladies and gentlemen, on the big show.  Checking in this morning, one of my favorite people in the whole wide world.  One of the funniest guys on the planet.  New York Times best-selling author.  Works on the O&A show. 
[01:25:00]  Opie and Anthony on Sirius XM.  Mr. Jim Norton on the broadcast.  How are you?  Hey, man.  Jimmy.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  We're right here.  I actually thought you were going to go to Brewer.  I was starting to panic.  You know what?  That was an...  I said yesterday, I said, make sure, E-Rock, that they get along.  I never know with comedians.  And it was just an accident that it fell down that way.  And I said, you know what?  If that happens, bump Brewer.  I loved you.  Comedians always get along because we want to bump into each other in the club. 
[01:25:30]  So, no, Brewer's the last guy I want to follow on the radio.  He's fantastic.  Have you called in yet?  No.  No.  No.  We put you first.  We've got to get you in here first.  Yeah, just get this one over with you.  Because Brewer's really good.  Get you on and get you off, right?  Yeah.  Hey, I know you always ask, whenever you're around celebrities, you've got to have your  picture taken with them.  Yes.  Isn't that...  Does that make you feel dippy?  You know, it's kind of something a tool does and a novice, and I've been doing it for 
[01:26:00]  my entire profession.  Daryl Hammond one time said to me, I was taking a picture with somebody, and then he walked  over and he goes, aren't you in show business?  I guess not, Daryl, but he really changed me.  That's a great way to put it, though.  I don't know why I do it.  I feel like I don't belong with them.  I never feel comfortable around famous people, even if they like me.  I knock myself down in their eyes by getting a photo.  It's really embarrassing.  Yeah, but you've turned it into a thing.  It's almost like a thing with you. 
[01:26:30]  It's your bit.  Well, I've learned that no matter what happens, you can turn it into something.  So if I get a good picture, I get a good picture, and if they say no or they're jerks about it,  I can mock it and make fun of it or make fun of myself.  So I've found a way to take a humiliating habit and make it seem like I'm doing it because  it's good comedy fodder.  I got you.  Have you ever had a really weird, other than Daryl Hammond, a weird response?  Diana Ross said no to me on a plane. 
[01:27:00]  It was so creepy.  Like, I followed her off the plane.  Actually, she was two seasons early, and I jumped in front of somebody who was talking  to her to ask her, and I'm like, can I have a picture, Ms. Ross?  And she put her hands up like I was about to strike her, and she went, oh, no, no, no,  no, no, please, no.  I'm like, I've heard that from women a lot, so I kind of...  You've made a retreat.  I'm not trying to have sex with you.  I just want a picture, right?  By the way, like I was about to strike, and I was like, oh, because my parents met at one  of your shows.  I said that to her, and it's a lie.  I actually lied, hoping that she would take a photo with me, and her person stepped in 
[01:27:30]  front of her, and they just kind of took her off.  That was the worst I've ever done.  She did her stop in the name of Love Hand?  Yeah, she gave me the hand, and I lied to her, and I was really embarrassed that I had  lied.  I don't know why I told that lie.  I know you're a big Kiss fan.  Yes.  And were you a kid when you first got into Kiss?  Yeah, it's weird.  I used to fantasize about them, and it was very weird.  I was like seven years old, and I would fantasize that Kiss would, this is the truth, it would 
[01:28:00]  beat me and hurt me and throw me down the steps, and then hug me and love me and make me feel  better when it was over.  There's a lot of psychology in that one.  I love that story.  Considering what I pay for sexually now.  Right.  I guess it definitely started at a young age.  I don't know what that meant, if it was anything weird, but that was a really weird connection  I had to love and unpleasantness.  It's funny because I worked with that group for a couple of years, and all my friends are, 
[01:28:30]  you've got to write a book, you've got to write a book, you've got to write...  Some of the stuff is actually unbelievable.  What did you do with them?  I was like a publicity manager.  I was hired by Casablanca to take them on the road and introduce them to radio stations  because I was already in radio, and I got fired from a job again.  And so this guy hired me to say, hey, I want you to take Kiss around the top 40 radio stations  and introduce them.  And they used to have to get in their makeup like twice a day. 
[01:29:00]  And I'd take them to the station in D.C. and we'd do a promotion and all that kind of thing.  Basically, I babysitted Ace.  Oh, he was kind of the one, even back then, that was kind of more likely to do something  and vomit during an interview or do something.  That's him.  Nice fella, but blue nun wine 24-7.  Were you surprised that Gene and Paul kind of had nothing to do with them?  I mean, I was like, come on, why don't they at least be friendly for the hall?  But it seems like Paul is the one really pushing this.  He really seems to hate those guys. 
[01:29:30]  Well, they let him down frequently, let's put it that way.  Did you read Peter's book where he said at one point, let's just say a girl was doing something,  and then Ace crawled under the covers with her, and it's the two of them under the covers with Peter.  Did you read that?  Yeah, I read that.  I was there, my friend.  Not there that particular night.  Jim, I wasn't there that night.  I was about to love you forever if you got under the covers.  That would have made me so happy.  I didn't do that.  It was, the problem was keeping track of Ace whenever we went somewhere. 
[01:30:00]  Was he worse than Peter?  It was a different, it was a different situation.  There was one time we were at a record store in Atlanta, Georgia.  True story.  And I had, we were doing, we were doing autographs.  As a matter of fact, the president of our company, Dan Mason, was there.  He ran a radio station in Atlanta then.  And I had to go back in the back room and get Ace, the limos were getting ready to leave.  We were done. 
[01:30:30]  And he was in the back room cuddling with a bottle of Blue Nun.  And I dragged him out front, and Gene was so upset, they left, they left, Jim.  They just took off.  And I started walking to the hotel with Ace in full regalia.  And these two guys picked us up in a little Ford, I think it was a Ford Falcon or something.  But I climbed in the back seat, and they said, this is great, a guy dressed up like Ace Fraley in our car.  Then you could see that they were, like, Gene was kind of the businessman, and they kind of wanted nothing to do with the rock. 
[01:31:00]  I think the Tom Snyder interview was the first, like, insight people had to how, like, the structural fractures in the band  was when Ace was just laughing and cackling, and Gene and Paul were just disgusted with him.  You made me laugh when you do that cackling.  And that's what he did, too.  Everything was funny.  He was the king of cheesy jokes.  Yeah, and he still liked to do something we did.  I was at the Hard Rock for Eddie Trunk, and Ace was there, and he was asking Jim Florentine and Don Jameson for jokes. 
[01:31:30]  And we all gave Ace jokes, and mine was the only one he didn't use, and I wanted to blow my brains out.  That was about three years ago.  I've been doing comedy since 1990, and I couldn't give a joke to Ace Frehley.  That was the most humiliating answer.  If you're into reading books, get the Ace Frehley book written by a friend, quote, unquote.  That's right.  Ex-friend.  And it's pretty revealing. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, this is not the biography he put out a couple years ago.  No, no.  There's a friend of his that ran around, and he ran around with all these tools.  I mean, losers.  You've got to get non-disclosures from all your people.  If the guy I'm on the road with, like Kenny, my road manager, if he ever decides to write a book, I mean, not that he's going to tell them anything I haven't, but they're going to know specific times, specific places that I had, you know, six-foot-four women with Adam's apples coming and going.  You've got to get people to sign non-disclosure agreements.  It's crazy.  Good idea. 
[01:32:30]  You're doing Caroline's on Broadway next week.  That's going to be a huge deal, isn't it?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Yeah, we were there last night, the Opie and Anthony show's 20th anniversary, unmasked interview with Ron Bennington.  So we spent some time there last night, and it was mobbed, and I'm hoping it looks good next weekend, too.  It's going to be fantastic.  I mean, God forbid that the radio show, we could have just done it on the same night that I had Caroline's.  This way it would have looked like I drew all those people.  Now it's going to look worse, and there's 40 people there for me next week.  Is ONA here?  No?  All right.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:33:00]  I was going to expect another unmasked thing if he's just me telling my stupid massage stories, and they're going to be like, we know where every joke is going.  And nobody laughing.  I think it'll be fine.  Tickets.  I appreciate it.  It was nice of you to plug me, and please come.  Tickets, carolines.com, New York's premier stand-up comedy nightclub.  Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Thanks, Jimmy, for checking in.  Without a doubt, I'm coming.  I mean, he'll be there.  All right.  Thank you very much.  I'm not going to plan on seeing you, but I appreciate it.  It's a possibility.  Let's put it that way.  That's a no in the radio world. 
[01:33:30]  See you, Jim.  All right, buddy.  Take care.  All right, it's good.  How about that?  I wish they could have done it last night.  They thought all those people were there for me.  Right.  Funny man.  Really nice guy, too.  Jim Norton, Opie and Anthony show.  Another funny guy coming up.  Jim Brewer right after the blast-off this morning.  Yeah, we got the Easter weekend blast-off coming up right after.  Jeez.  Jimmy's back in studio there.  Can you believe, Scott?  I had no idea.  No.  All I was going to do was ask him kiss questions. 
[01:34:00]  Right?  Fuck, man.  He was with them in the Casablanca's 73, 74.  Amazing, right?  How long did he work for them?  Wow.  He's got the picture I want.  There's the picture right there.  Oh, man.  On Scott Shannon's Twitter, which is Scott Shannon CBS.  We're looking at an old kiss photo where Scott Shannon's a young guy.  Dude, that's the Destroyer tour.  That's 76.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  He's held by the outfits.  That's awesome.  He was right there with them.  In the beginning.  I had no idea.  Him and Ace Freely fucking walking home. 
[01:34:30]  Good job on there, Jimmy.  That was funny, man.  Yeah.  And we got to just sit back and listen for 10 minutes.  Right?  Nice.  He was really nice.  Especially today.  But that was interesting.  I really had no idea he was involved with Kiss.  No.  The guy's been all over fucking the business.  But that's what you want is somebody that's just going to chat with you.  Right.  I didn't know if he was asking me the Kiss question to get to that bit, but it was a true story.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he did great.  And he sounds great.  Doesn't he sound fantastic?  He sounds completely different. 
[01:35:00]  Just re-energized, man.  So weird.  It's great.  That was funny, man.  I thought that was fucking six foot two.  Four.  Yeah, six foot four.  Woman with an ass.  Jesus.  Well, I didn't, you know, it makes you think, though, like there's these people who know.  I mean, there's nothing the people are going to find out about me that no one knows, really.  But, like, God, these guys in this world, like, man, I wonder what Travolta's guys have to sign, if anything.  Oh, man.  Or, you know, the agents and the people, the personal assistants. 
[01:35:30]  Jeez.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, boy, if I wrote a book about him making out with men on the stairs to the plane.  What could they get you?  Is that your water?  Yeah.  There's waters all over the place.  No, this one's fine.  I don't know what that is.  I'm slamming water today.  Yeah, man.  Can you hear them a little sick?  A little?  Yeah.  Is Travis sick, too?  You know, if you'll.  Travis is finally back.  Travis, you missed a great event, Travis.  I know.  You know what I got?  No, I stayed home purposely because I didn't want to see you.  Oh.  I like saying it was mean.  Oh, Travis.  That's mean. 
[01:36:00]  I tried to come in yesterday, but I almost passed out on the bus, so I went back.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  They were just too busy drugging.  You have the flu bug?  I think so, yeah.  I'm better today, though.  Fuck.  That's good.  I'm so jealous of that Scott Shannon picture.  Is Mars here?  I forgot to thank him at the Unmasked.  Is he bummed?  I haven't seen him.  But wasn't he?  Why didn't he go last night?  He doesn't care about the show.  Yeah, it's a problem with his level of commitment.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I was trying to name the whole staff, and I even said, did I miss anyone? 
[01:36:30]  And no one yells out Mars.  Oh, boy.  He's not.  I need a little help with that last night.  He's not a hangout staff guy.  But I didn't mean to not say his name, so thank you to Mars, too.  Do we have your intro?  I'm sure we do.  So, oh, here's Mars.  Limping down the hall.  Yeah, he's getting along.  You're getting along a little better there without the cane and everything?  Why weren't you there last night?  And I apologize. 
[01:37:00]  I didn't mention you when I did the whole staff thing.  Thank you very much.  But I was trying to remember on the spot, and I even said, did I miss anyone?  So I'm sorry if you heard that.  No, no.  Thank you for thinking of me.  I appreciate it.  I'm sorry.  Why weren't you there?  It's just a little weird sometimes with the timing, and I live in Jersey.  Oh, Jersey's far.  Just that whole thing.  No, you guys were done at 10-12, and me coming back at that time.  Yeah.  It's a little difficult.  But I wish I was there.  Plus the staff doesn't like. 
[01:37:30]  We're all hurting today because it was a long night.  We got it, though.  You need an abuse.  It's a family.  You know.  What happened?  A little sparring injury?  No, man.  I've been hiding now.  I got a little herpes on the fucking lip there.  You got a little swamp?  Embarrassing.  Fucking embarrassing.  Why?  Yes, I love my herpes.  I got a little herpes.  You got a little swamp?  How long you had that?  Swamp what?  Two days.  No, I mean in your life.  Years ago, I had it about five years ago, I believe.  That comes on.  You just got it?  Five years ago? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, the first time that this broke out was five years ago.  Was it from sucking dick?  I don't know.  I don't think so because I actually don't know.  I don't think so is his answer.  You wolf.  But I apologize for that.  Those come out because of stress.  I don't get them as much.  Thank God.  No, you used to get them all the time.  All the fucking time.  But one would clear up and then the next one would pop.  Always before an appearance.  Always.  There's a million pictures of me out there with swamp light. 
[01:38:30]  Really?  No.  But I don't really get them as much these days.  Less stress, I guess.  I don't know.  Try them.  But that virus is in you constantly and then it's the stress that makes it pop out.  Yeah.  What do you do for it?  Well, there was this cream that you get.  Creams don't work.  Prescribed?  Yeah, prescription.  Okay.  What's the cream?  Well, you got that one.  A little Valtrex cream? 
[01:39:00]  Valtrex is you take in pills for them, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one.  And then they got the other one that's over the counter.  It's 20 bucks.  As soon as you feel it, you have to...  I think the whole world's on Valtrex at this point.  What, does it just get all tingly or something?  Yeah, you feel it, man.  When it comes on, it's a bummer because it starts with a little tingle, a little itching,  and then it just starts growing from that point on.  Yeah.  No.  And then the damn thing pops and it's just all raw nerves. 
[01:39:30]  And then you know you're stuck with it for a good week or so.  So I was hiding.  I've been hiding because of that.  I didn't want you guys to fuck with me.  It's really noticeable.  I know.  I hate it.  Why?  Because I don't know.  There are fucking drones that could get a photo of that.  That's really obvious.  When you get that tingle, you've got to get the Valtrex in you immediately,  and it knocks it completely down to almost nothing.  Which is lie.  So you banged your lip on something.  Yeah, that's true.  It doesn't look like that at all.  Yeah, no one believes that ever.  It looks like a damn. 
[01:40:00]  I used to do all that shit, and no one believes you.  The only thing is I can't eat pussy right now.  Oh, man.  Why can't you?  Because it isn't that good for my wife.  You probably gave it to her.  Oh, shit.  Good job, Mars.  Yeah.  Damn.  Way to go, buddy.  I really believe the whole world's on Valtrex.  Yep, probably.  Yep.  Wow.  They said the percentage of people that actually have a little...  It's in the herpes family, but it's not the big one.  The herpes family.  What's the big one? 
[01:40:30]  I guess the big herpes that you get...  There's the big one.  Genital herpes.  You get on your genitals.  Genitals?  And there's the other one on the mouth, which is much more common.  Genitals?  You need to point to your genitals.  I know where they are.  He pointed at his genitals.  It's the genitals.  I just wanted you to look, Jim.  I did.  I would look anyway.  The lip one is very common.  Yeah.  And it is in that family, but it's not the big one.  Genitals.  It's a funny word.  It's terrible.  It's horrible.  You don't have genital herpes, do you?  No.  Try to blow yourself.  That'd be kind of fun to go full circle. 
[01:41:00]  Can you give it to yourself like that?  I do.  Have you ever blown yourself?  No, sir.  I can't reach it.  Did you try?  No.  He said he can't reach it.  Mars is about a five and three quarters, I'd say.  No, actually, I think I'm pretty healthy.  There you go.  Thick.  Thick and nice size.  Yeah, he probably has a thick plug dick.  No, it's a nice size.  Well, draw it.  Draw it?  Yeah.  Draw what it looks like.  What it looks like.  Or at least like the girth and the length. 
[01:41:30]  Artist rendering.  Here's Mars.  Mars is going to draw his own penis.  Draw his own penis.  Draw his own penis.  Okay.  He's touching it.  You don't have to like put the hair and all that on there.  It's just a general.  No way.  Yeah, I think it's a.  Look how fat he made it.  Get the fuck out of here.  Look how fat he made it.  That's good.  Get that on Twitter.  There's no way.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's not your dick. 
[01:42:00]  It's as big as a water bottle.  He's drawing it very fat.  Is it really that fat?  And I have a fat head.  Big fat mushroom head.  That's not as big as your horse.  He just drew a horse cock.  Because I have a fat head.  That might not be too size, but.  No, it's not too size.  This right here.  Yeah.  He drew a horse cock, dude.  You're the worst.  That looks like a black guy giving the fucking black power sign. 
[01:42:30]  He should be holding it up at the Olympics.  Yeah.  So you're saying the head isn't that big, but the rest of it, the shaft is that thick.  The head is big.  No, I'm saying the head is big.  And the shaft is pretty thick.  Yeah.  Like that?  Yeah.  He's exaggerating a bit.  Wow.  Is it, Jimmy?  He's a destroyer.  Yeah.  That's how many inches across there?  Fifteen.  Yeah.  Okay, maybe.  I don't know.  Diameter.  Two inches?  Sam, go get Mars hard and tell us what it is.  Okay.  Go fluff him.  Show us with your mouth. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Travis knows.  Why does Travis know?  What?  Travis knows.  Travis knows.  Comment.  Why are you just throwing him under the bus like that?  Yeah.  He knows what we got.  It's weird.  I don't know.  Have you ever stroked Mars' shaft?  I mean once, but that was eight years ago.  And it's probably hairy pubes.  Hairy pubes?  What other kinds are there?  I'm very sick.  I meant to say pubes or hair and I threw them together because I'm not feeling well.  Hairy pubes.  All right.  Well, what, Sam?  Just show Mars. 
[01:43:30]  There's a photo on O&A Show on Twitter of Mars proudly showing the drawing of his penis.  Oh, nice.  Can you tell size in the photo?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me show it to you.  All right.  Yeah, you can go to O&A Show on Twitter.  You be the judge.  Mars' ridiculous drawing.  Wait, it looks a lot bigger on the picture, though.  No.  That's what you drew.  You drew that.  Yeah, you swear it's that big.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  It's a nice size.  It looks like you traced the microphone. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, Mars.  He literally drew...  Is your head that crooked?  It looks like there's all sorts of problems with the...  And it's the size of your fist?  Yeah, that's like...  Yeah, that's the size of your head.  Crazy.  All right.  And Mars talking himself up.  That's nice.  Good for Mars.  Yeah.  Indeed he do.  See you guys.  All right.  Take it easy, Mars.  Did you run into any fans after our dinner, or...?  Not really, no.  No?  No.  Not really.  I kind of wanted to, like, go do something with them, but... 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, I went out to a bar.  Had a few beers with my brother and stuff.  Yeah, it was fun.  What happened to, um, Dennis Falcone?  He was there.  He was?  Okay.  I didn't see him.  Well, Dennis Falcone was not happy with, uh, Sam's intro.  Uh-oh.  Should we get...  Should we play your intro and then have Dennis, uh, critique it, or...?  Well, I mean, maybe Dennis should be in here while you play it?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Dennis!  You did...  You did realize you were being broadcasted, right? 
[01:45:00]  You were.  I never...  I wasn't on the radio.  You're gonna be.  Well, of course I never...  And you should have known that.  Well...  In hindsight, you should have known that.  Hindsight is...  We would have got the audio.  Pick up Dennis Falcone.  Who was wearing...  What was he wearing yesterday?  He was wearing a hip-hop hat.  I wish it was a toe tag.  What hip-hop hat were you wearing yesterday?  Oh, that stunk.  That shade hat he had on.  Oh, shade 45.  Flat 50.  That's terrible.  Straight brim.  Oh, you don't pull that off.  You look like a sick kid in the hospital. 
[01:45:30]  It was too big for you?  It was terrible.  Like a giant progeria kid.  I gave it to my son.  All right.  Well, that's fine.  Little son.  Why'd you have to wear it first?  Because it was fun.  Oh.  What'd you think of Unmasked?  It was great.  Nice event.  It was a great event.  Sure it was.  Opening was a little weak.  You had a problem with Sam's opening?  Yeah.  It was like, after we close the coffin, then we'll take the procession to the...  Come on.  It's a party.  You should have been out there.  It wasn't a party.  It was a live broadcast.  It was a fun event. 
[01:46:00]  You should have gone out there.  Everybody had to behave themselves for it.  You didn't pump up the audience.  No, you didn't pump up the crowd.  Yeah, we didn't.  And that's what Dennis is saying.  Right.  Because he knows how to get a party started.  Sure, he leaves.  You went out there and there's a big guy, Kenny.  He'll throw you out if you...  You know, it's like, come on.  Why don't we listen to him?  And Dennis, you control this.  So when you want to stop the tape to make your comments, we'll do that, okay?  Where did he get this kind of power from?  This is Sam Roberts, knowing that he was going to be on the radio.  No, no, no.  This is what he gave to people.  No. 
[01:46:30]  What?  I went up...  Are you on the radio with this?  ...for five minutes off the air for the live crowd to make sure that they behaved.  But as soon as we push this button, you're now on the air with your intro.  Understood.  And you should have known that.  You should have known the tricks of the trade.  Was your mommy proud?  As a matter of fact, my mom said I did a very good job.  Of course she did.  What is she supposed to say?  Yeah, we saw the Roberts family last night.  Your dad had extra wax in his mustache because it was a big event.  It was going out.  And Dennis... 
[01:47:00]  I can't do this.  I love his parents.  I have to say it.  They're the best people.  They're really nice.  They're really nice.  He wasn't a warner-y because he wanted to do the intro and get the kibosh.  They didn't want him.  No, no, no, no.  Because they know his shtick.  No, I wasn't angry.  No, we wanted glow-in-the-dark hula hoops.  Sorry.  I wasn't angry.  We wanted to have a serious interview with Opie and Anthony.  No room for glow sticks.  Who said no to the Dennis Falcone intro?  It was like everybody who was associated with the program.  Don asked me to do it.  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Whitman came to me personally.  Everybody told you not to.  No, he wanted it.  Everybody except Don because when we had the discussion, it was like, oh, yeah, we'll put 
[01:47:30]  Dennis on as a goof and watch him flounder.  And then we were like, wait, I think he'd have pulled it off.  He knows how to get the crowd going.  That's his job.  I would have walked out of the grave.  I would have had the music playing.  I would have had Happy Playing.  Oh, good.  Just start that song playing.  Let the song establish.  Perfect.  Let the song establish.  Then I would go out with a wireless mic in the back of the room.  Start in the back of the room.  People are like, hey, where is he?  You guys happy?  You guys happy?  Just start.  Yeah, let me hear him.  Come on.  Come on. 
[01:48:00]  Come on.  Because Dennis doesn't understand not making the show about himself.  Was it about myself?  Was it about myself?  You wanted to play music and start a party for yourself.  Then I would have gone into Get Your Hands Up in the Air by Danzel.  Get your hands up in the air.  Let's go.  Let me hear those hands.  Get those hands together.  Come on.  Club it out.  Club it out.  Let's go.  See?  You guys want to have a good time?  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you guys want to have a good time.  I'm feeling this.  I am feeling this.  Everybody say, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Say, Anthony, Anthony.  Get the crowd pump up.  Oh, man.  He goes, O-A, O-N-A.  Oh, man.  I like it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm liking this.  You guys ready for a good time?  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I'm feeling it.  Exactly.  I'm feeling it.  Come on.  Let's make some more noise.  Instead of, no photography will be permitted in the building.  Ladies and gentlemen, please refrain from smiling.  Oh, God, Sam.  Sam did turn into a funeral dirge.  It sucked.  If Dennis had his way, we would have handed out noisemakers before the show.  All right.  That would have been all right.  Is that a problem?  Yes.  Would have came out with the wireless mic.  Just running around the crowd.  Nice.  Nice.  Just getting those hands clapped.  Nice.  I would have everybody stand up when they want to. 
[01:49:00]  Yes.  This is what we wanted.  It is.  Yes.  Get up on your feet.  Get up on your feet.  Let's hear it now.  Yes.  A little dance party before we come out.  So, that's it.  Nobody told me that that's what you guys were looking for.  And then how would you finally introduce...  Ladies and gentlemen.  ...Ronnie and then us.  Please put your hands together for two men who have just changed the broadcast industry.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Would you have a song under you?  Yeah.  I'd still be playing that beat to...  So, some kind of big...  Oh, yeah.  Just keep it going.  Yeah, yeah.  Just even get down tonight or something. 
[01:49:30]  Just getting the crowd up there.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  We came here for one reason.  That's to have a great time and to celebrate.  Yes.  Yes.  The Unmashed with Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Ron Bennington.  And here's Ronny.  And you guys would have came out from the back, right?  Oh, fuck yeah.  High-fiving people.  High-fiving everybody.  Thank you.  Yes.  Everything is a cheap wedding reception with this guy.  Yeah.  It would have came out.  It would have been great. 
[01:50:00]  Anthony would have been shaking the beer, shooting it up in the air like a baseball.  He's making some good points.  I haven't heard one.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so sorry we're all gathered here this evening for this occasion.  The hearses will follow everyone to the cemetery.  Come on.  He's right.  He's right, Sam.  He's not right.  He's very right.  He's right.  I haven't heard what it sounded like.  That could have been an up.  Well, why don't we hear how you did it?  See if any of the things Dennis is talking about here...  And Dennis just threw that together, like, spur of the moment, right here as we're talking. 
[01:50:30]  Because it's the same bullshit he's done at every Sweet Sixteen, every wedding, every bat mitzvah, every...  It works, baby.  It's the same old song.  It works, baby.  Don't call me baby.  It works.  You're just jealous.  Of what?  You don't have his chops.  You're right.  Can we hear it?  All right.  This is Sam.  Yes, Sam.  Getting everyone pumped for the unmasked.  I wasn't getting everybody pumped.  Yes, you were.  That was your job.  That was your spot.  We all know it now.  Oh, Caroline. 
[01:51:00]  They want it.  They want it.  I'm Nick.  The Opie and Anthony.  So far, so good.  Thank you.  I wish everybody was just nice.  Oh, there it goes.  No, no, no.  We're here for one reason, and that's to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the greatest show  in the history of the medium, the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  So far, so good.  It almost sounded like you were going to mention another radio show.  Right.  If you get three posters, there will be three posters. 
[01:51:30]  Ah, you're just astounding.  They're all signs.  Stop.  Yes.  I would not have mentioned the posters because they were a negative.  What are you talking about?  They're getting a free poster.  They're all getting one.  Yeah.  At the end of the night, they're going to get them anyway.  How is that a negative?  We're giving out goodie bags.  It doesn't matter.  At the end of the night, just because you took a lot of flack on the air about the posters.  We've been talking.  You took a lot of flack on the air.  You're still taking flack.  We've been talking about it on the air for two days, right? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Do you think the entire audience is aware of that?  Has anybody agreed with you when they called up?  You're right, Sam.  Only make 2,000 posters.  2,000?  Whatever they made.  That would be nice.  I think there was, what, 120 or something?  That was a negative, so you shouldn't have even mentioned the poster.  You've got to avoid negatives, right, Dennis?  In that situation, everybody could laugh.  Yeah.  The poster wasn't the two stars of the evening, right there.  Ah, there you go.  And then, of course, Jimmy came out.  There's three stars.  Four, actually, with Rob Bennington, too.  Four stars.  Four stars.  But it was the unmasked for them.  Yes. 
[01:52:30]  Four stars.  Go ahead.  Let's hear the rest of Tam's soliloquy here.  Tam's?  Sam's soliloquy.  Tam's soliloquy.  But in addition, so you're all very, very lucky.  There's a lot of special people here tonight.  Don Whitman is in the back.  Stop.  Figure out a way to get Donald Trump to bring up a cake.  Stop.  People don't care about the behind-the-scenes people of Don Whitman.  I know they mention them on the air.  Again, you're pulling it away from Opie and Anthony.  Take it down from here.  No, I'm not.  Because I was just about to talk about the cupcakes. 
[01:53:00]  We should have played Elton John funeral for a friend under you.  It was like a dirge, you know?  Well, if we listen to this, as compared to the image, the image that was painted just  moments ago, it's a failure.  You interrupted when I was mentioning Don so I could bring up the cupcakes and everybody  have a nice laugh.  All right.  Well, let's get back to the tape and see if we bring it around.  Go ahead.  Play through.  Take out.  We're just kidding.  We're not having any celebrities out here because tonight is all about the people that 
[01:53:30]  are going to be on this stage.  It's about Opie, Anthony, and little Jimmy Norton.  With that said, let's all remember that, of course, cheer, laugh when appropriate.  Hold on, he wants to stop.  No, let him go.  Oh, okay. 
[01:54:00]  Sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Don't need to die who makes it about you.  And remember, there's a reason that Lady Di was banned.  That's not the company that I think you want to be in.  And if that is the company that you want to be in, if you insist on talking, you'll get  to meet some other celebrities from the radio show.  Keep the cop in Club Stoney Penny.  Hey, stop it right there.  You threaten people if Luca Brasi is going to throw them out if there's a problem, right?  Again, even when I work communion parties and I give out blow-up guitars, I go, hey,  we're going to give out some blow-up guitars. 
[01:54:30]  Remember, these are not weapons, so we don't want to see anybody hitting each other.  So that's basically what you did.  You laid the ground rules out.  But you could have done it in a fun way.  Hey, by the way, guys, I know you guys know all the behind-the-scenes reference of the  show.  You don't have to yell out anything like, Slabo!  You don't have to yell that out, right?  No, no, no, no.  That's where you could have pushed that in.  And bringing up Slabo and stuff, that encourages people to say Slabo.  These people were afraid to move.  There was two guys in the men's room at the end of the night saying, I really have to go  take a leak.  I didn't want to move.  I thought Stan was going to throw me out.  It was a live broadcast.  We don't want people moving around and talking. 
[01:55:00]  It's not a party.  You just said it was a party, and it's not.  We said the time frame was a little short.  It was a party.  Yeah, it is a party.  It was a celebration.  It's not a party.  It's an interview.  Life is a party, my friend.  Life is a party.  Don't invite me.  It was Thursday night.  That's beautiful.  It was Thursday night.  That was nice.  Thank you, Dennis.  It was 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Thursday, the unofficial kickoff to the weekend.  It was 4 p.m.  Yeah.  Again, playing on a negative.  We didn't have a lot of time, so take the 5-minute rap that you were going to do, knock it down  in 2 minutes, and bring the guys out that much quicker. 
[01:55:30]  Keep that music pumping as they go through the crowd.  High-fiving.  High-fiving.  First of all, they don't want to do that.  Opie from one side.  Ronnie coming out of the middle.  That's pretty good.  Watch the spotlights.  That would be all neat at the stage.  That would have been cool.  Spotlights would have been nice.  5 seconds from Times Square.  Racing around the room.  All those lights and everything.  Smoke machine just pumping.  What do you think about maybe the room goes dark and there's just spotlights on us coming  from the crowd?  I like it, right?  Just a sparkle.  Colors and everything. 
[01:56:00]  No, we got, ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together.  Give a warm welcome.  The guitar riff started me up.  People were laughing.  They liked the Lady Di thing.  And nobody did any stupid show references, did they?  They wouldn't have done them.  They were petrified.  What do you mean they wouldn't have done them?  Have you ever been to an Opie and Anthony live event?  Yes, yes.  They wouldn't have done them.  I would have liked to come out to start me up by the songs.  That would have been kind of cool.  We made you an intro.  What intro?  We played an intro at the beginning of the show that hyped you up. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  But what song was that?  That wasn't on my hard drive of hits.  What was that song?  It was a, we produced an intro that they walked out to.  No, no.  There was a song afterwards.  Nine Inch Nails?  It was something that symbolizes what the show was.  It should have been a Mass Appeal song.  It should have been something big.  It should have been a song that everybody knows.  The show is not a Mass Appeal show.  It's a mean show.  No, it's not.  That's like making 12 cronuts, right?  We don't want these things to be a Mass Appeal.  No, we want to do a show for our audience.  You're with me with the posters.  Everyone should get a poster. 
[01:57:00]  Without a doubt.  And I did also mention, I mentioned to him, maybe we should have a series of collector  posters.  You know, like, throughout the season, a little ball game.  The first one is maybe a Derek Jeter one from his rookie year.  The second one is, so it builds.  Says the guy who collects bumper stickers from the 70s.  Yeah, our audience is, a lot of them are married.  They can't hang up 10 different posters.  Ah, true.  I would have said four.  They can't hang up four.  What wife is going to tolerate four cartoony radio show posters?  In the man cave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, can we hear the rest of the intro? 
[01:57:30]  Oh.  Please.  Make sure that your unmasked experience comes to a quick and severe end.  It's a historic night.  I'm happy to be here.  I'm sure you're happy to be here.  Very limited tickets, which is why I want everybody to experience the moment.  And if you can experience life with us for a change.  Posters!  Put all your cell phones away.  That was me.  No photos.  That was hoping.  That was hoping.  I mean, you can do it right now, but once the show starts. 
[01:58:00]  No photos and videos because, I mean, we have an HD camera group here.  It's going to look better.  Can I ask you to pause?  Stop that.  Sam sounds like a woman giving a speech at a Kiwanis club.  Oh, God.  Yes.  And the 50-50 raffle.  Yes.  And we're so happy doing one inside joke.  And Bill knows what I mean.  Right.  Why couldn't they take a cell phone shot if they wanted to?  Because it was asked that they didn't because it would have been a distraction.  Dennis, was he a little wordy there?  Yeah.  Also, you said limited edition. 
[01:58:30]  That's in the past.  Right.  That's like when you come out of a song, you're coming out of a list of the music, Doobie  Brothers, over.  Forward motion.  Move to the next time.  Forward motion.  Forward motion.  You liked forward motion.  We know there's limited edition.  You really did.  They're already there.  They can't do anything about it.  It's in the past.  I didn't like it.  Why would they want to do anything about it?  Limited edition is not a bad thing.  They get it.  You're here.  Hey, you're an exclusive club.  We're glad you guys are here tonight.  That's the point of bringing up limited edition.  Okay, but it's an exclusive club.  We're here to have a great time.  A Thursday night party.  It's not the night time.  It's four. 
[01:59:00]  You've got to make believe it's night time.  Night time.  Because there were no windows in there.  Yeah.  When I left, I was like, holy shit, it's still light out.  Yeah, I thought it was night time.  Crazy.  Did you do a mic check beforehand?  Could I use a little reverb on that mic?  Reverb.  Reverb.  A little bass, maybe.  Yeah, a little bass.  Pump it up and down.  You should have turned it up.  Because if you did a mic check beforehand when the room was empty, it would have sounded different,  though, because the room was empty.  But we're not going to do a mic check for something that's not on the air.  It's on the air now.  It's not the mic check.  It's on the air now.  Yeah.  But that's your choice. 
[01:59:30]  That's your prerogative.  It's going to be on the air.  My prerogative.  Not your prerogative.  Opie's prerogative.  Good song.  Yeah, that could have been cool to come out to.  You were good with the song you came out to.  Yeah.  Not really.  Start Me Up would have been better.  Start Me Up would have been good.  All right, let's go to the end of Sam's dirge.  Dirge.  I mean, we have an HD camera through here.  It's going to look better than anything you get.  And there's a professional photographer.  That was me.  I was shushing you.  I heard you.  I was from the stage.  Oh, you did?  God damn it is what I said to myself. 
[02:00:00]  It's going to be better than anything you get.  Make fun of the people's cameras.  Oh, I'm Reese Clankin.  On the Opie and Anthony Show Facebook page.  So it's all very, very exciting.  I can't think of anybody better than Ron Bennington to be the guy.  Stop.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a guy who's going to just rock this night with Opie and Anthony.  So please, put your hands together.  This is when you bring it all together, Sam. 
[02:00:30]  Right, Dennis.  Remain standing.  Raise your glasses.  Let's hear it for Ron Bennington.  I'm not introducing him.  Who are you introducing?  I'm just mentioning his name because he's going to be out there.  Cut to it.  Short attention span.  I wasn't there to introduce people.  People have a short attention span.  Dennis, we had an introduction.  We had a piece.  I'm not introducing them to the stage.  And then when Jimmy came out, a little maybe strutter, a little kiss music for him.  Yeah.  Detroit Rock City.  Yes.  Oh, so just stop the broadcast cold.  Well, not really.  When they introduced him, we would have choreographed this, you know. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  Opie would have had a certain cue.  He should have got a much bigger intro.  Yeah.  He should have came out of the back.  I think he should have came from the rafters.  Jimmy should have came down from the rafters.  Jim, are you upset with your introduction to Unmask?  I should have been floated down.  Yes.  It would have been nice if Jimmy was floated down.  Yes.  In a seat.  Right.  The crown.  No, that's not the vibe of Unmask.  The tech crew could unclip him quickly so he could sit down next to us.  What's not the vibe of Unmask?  After he floated down.  I actually should have come up through a hole in the stage. 
[02:01:30]  Da-da!  And then the smoke.  Yes.  And then you just appear there.  Then I just sit there quietly, happy to be here.  We should have walked out with a girl on each arm.  Yes.  Two beautiful young ladies.  Did we have girls in the budget?  I mean, I don't know if it was a budgetary issue, but it wasn't about girls.  It was about an adult.  Why didn't Jimmy get the big intro?  Sit down, in-depth conversation with Opie, Anthony, and Jim about their careers, which  has never been done before.  Jimmy should have been carried in.  Could have just put a little Hollywood in it, babe.  That's all.  A little Hollywood, babe.  A little Hollywood, babe. 
[02:02:00]  Would you like to have been carried in, Jimmy?  I would have.  Oh, like, yes.  Like ancient Egypt.  Nobody told me that.  Like Cleopatra.  Yes.  And I would have felt somebody's hand in my finger in my hiney and I would have pretended  not to notice.  Jesus.  You would have let them leave it up there?  I sure would have.  Just saying, that's the way I would have done it.  Yeah, it would have been a shit show.  No, no, no, no.  Is that it?  It sounds up and fun, man.  I don't know.  You would have enjoyed it, Ant?  Yes.  Sounds very fun.  That's all.  Let's hear it. 
[02:02:30]  The rest of it.  Was that it?  No, there's two minutes.  What?  Two more minutes?  Jesus.  Did this go on and on?  All right.  Keep going.  I can't think of anybody better than Ron Dennington to be the guy.  Go for cheap applause.  Tell him, Dennis.  Bring him out.  Get right to it.  I'm not there to bring him out.  Opie and Anthony have never, to my knowledge, sat down and been a part of an in-depth interview.  I mean...  Stop.  Who cares?  Who cares if they've never been a part? 
[02:03:00]  Who cares?  That doesn't matter.  Everybody, you're there to witness something that's never been done before.  So just say for the first time, ladies and gentlemen, this is in a historic moment.  This has never happened before.  I just did.  You don't say to my knowledge.  You're the authority.  You're the authority.  To my knowledge is now your problem.  That's a good point.  Just cut it down.  Right.  That's a good point.  Do you know?  If you have an 18-second intro, you can't be talking for 36 seconds.  I don't have an 18-second intro.  We're not talking up songs.  Again, if you had the music under you, you would have been pumped.  When you don't have music under you, you can do this and go there. 
[02:03:30]  I'm trying to fill.  The Rock Never Stops?  There you go.  I like that.  Only twice an hour.  That's right.  For commercials.  When the music stops, that's news.  Time for Action Central News.  You're a piece of garbage.  No, I'm not.  You've got it all down, man.  I'm just having a little Friday fun.  It's not fun.  A little Friday fun.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Can we get to the end of this thing?  Go ahead.  There's so many stories, so much life that's been lived by this show.  Remember, it's going to be a live broadcast, which means after I'm done up here, there'll 
[02:04:00]  be an intro play.  You'll all get to hear the intro, which is a special treat for everyone.  Listen to the non-reaction.  And once that ends, once the intro ends, that's the one part where you are always going to  be a part of the show.  Because everybody's going to clap.  I will say this.  It's almost like check all pizzazz at the door.  If you would have done the Denny Falcone, done it the Denny Falcone way, you wouldn't 
[02:04:30]  have had to tell the people to bring it up and practice their applause because they just  naturally would have done it because they were having a good time.  You don't need to practice applause.  But I'm not a big phony who locks away my misery and pretends nothing's wrong.  Wow.  So it wouldn't have worked for me.  I don't know where to get that from.  I wasn't there.  You're a big phony for other reasons. 
[02:05:00]  We were there for fun.  It was a good time event.  Did you have a good time?  Well, yeah.  Once the show started, yeah.  Oh, that means he wasn't having fun.  Well, you would have had a worse time if everybody was sitting there tooting their kazoos that  you would have had.  I wasn't going to give out kazoos.  I would have had the interns maybe give out some tropical necklaces.  Yes.  Oh, man.  That's perfect.  You want to hear tropical necklaces, crinkle, crinkle, black and yellow, O&A colors.  The whole crowd is wearing.  That would have been nice.  Yeah, that would have been good.  Yeah, that would have been good. 
[02:05:30]  And then they carry Jim out.  I'm feeling it.  Eventually, halfway through the Unmasked.  Five different songs during the intro.  To really get that energy going again.  Yeah.  Just in case there was starting to get a lull, then you had the big Jim Norton intro.  Yeah.  I think Floated would have been better than Jim Norton.  That would have been really nice.  Floated.  Like Peter Pan.  Right.  Peter Pansley.  Peter Puffer.  You were conducting it.  Oh, two Peter references. 
[02:06:00]  I was defenseless.  You were conducting it like it was traffic court.  That's Dennis' line.  Don't mention the posters that everybody wants that you're going to get.  Going to get them out at the end of the day.  But spend some time to hand out Hawaiian necklaces.  Because it's fun.  What do you have against that?  And what are you going to do?  Are you going to do a little joke about getting laid?  Hey.  No.  That's clever.  Thank you, Jim.  Chip liked it.  I just said we could have gone over this.  I could have coached you through it.  I'm glad I didn't say one word to you about it.  You don't respect a professional like Denny Falcone, who's been in this business for a long time. 
[02:06:30]  He just knows what the people want and need at a live appearance.  He hasn't been in the business that we were in last night.  He's been in a whole different business that I want to know part of.  There's a room full of people that want to have fun, if you ask me.  They just can't have a good time.  I think Denny knows how to handle a room full of people that want to have fun.  Denny's been at this a long time, almost making it.  You've got to respect that.  You're right.  I've only been almost making it.  He's been on the cusp for 20, 25 years.  That's true.  I can't do what they do, so I do what I do. 
[02:07:00]  Unfortunately, I don't get paid as much as they do doing what I do.  People don't want to hear it, so that's what happens.  You've passed out maybe just a couple blow-up guitars, though.  Just a few.  Sprinkle the room with it a bit.  I would have them on the table.  Maybe for the big Jim Norton intro.  Yeah, definitely.  When Jimmy comes out, I would have been playing that rock and roll all night.  Get up and play those air guitars.  Some people would have been air guitar and in the crowd.  I see the vision.  He's got a vision, yes.  He set the tables up a little differently on the dance floor.  So when Jimmy came out, I could have had a couple of girls dancing with him. 
[02:07:30]  People came out, rock and roll all night, getting those hands clapping.  Yes.  Jimmy could have been, you know, boogieing.  That would have been good, Sam.  We needed to sex it up a little bit, right?  Yeah.  Just a little glitz.  A little glitz.  In a classy way, though.  The event he's describing isn't an unmasked or an O&A live event.  It's some fucking stupid...  Oh, so we had to do it the same way all the time, because that's exactly what Opie and  Anthony have built their career on, doing it the same all the time.  Unmasked face.  Unmasked is branded.  People expect a certain thing out of the brand. 
[02:08:00]  You don't ruin the brand.  Not when we're coming to town.  Is that right?  We do it a little different.  We shake it up.  We shake it up.  When you come to town, you get a $15 an hour wedding DJ to spice it up.  Yes.  Sam, this is business, and you're taking it very personal.  All right?  Very personal.  Just business.  We could have sat down.  I'm not taking anything personally.  I could have helped you.  You don't have that effect on me.  You don't have the ability.  I could have helped you.  All right.  Can we get to the end of this, please?  Oh, my God.  This was supposed to be a five-minute break.  Let's practice. 
[02:08:30]  Let's practice?  They're cheering.  They've never cheered before?  They're cheering.  All you've got to do is you don't say, let's practice.  You don't need to say, let's practice, because all the people that went out of their way  to try to get a ticket for this thing, you've got to assume, are very hardcore as far as  being fans of the show.  Right.  So you know the energy is just going to be there when it's time.  But you want to make sure it's there.  These people were more pumped up than you.  That's the point.  Someone's saying it sounded like a shitty best man speech. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, God.  It did.  Yes.  Yeah, they should be more pumped up than me, dude.  But you didn't have to just say, let's make some noise.  Now, let's practice.  You're commenting on my verbiage?  Let's make some noise for the boys.  You should have wondered.  Oh, that's a good noise for the boys.  I like it.  That's terrible.  I got a Sam supporter, just to be fair.  Oh, thank God.  Pat and Buffalo.  Mrs. Roberts.  Oh, Pat.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing this morning?  All right.  I think you guys are missing the point of this. 
[02:09:30]  I think Denny is used to working with adults at weddings, whereas Sam is dealing with  tests.  So, as a father myself, he's coming at them.  Like, I would lecture my children before we go to dinner at Thanksgiving at my sister's  house, so they're not giving people the finger and throwing rolls across the table and telling  people to fuck off.  You've got to really set the table for children to make sure that they behave themselves.  And I think that's what Sam was doing.  He's not wrong.  Denny's trying to get people up and doing a conga line before the whole goddamn thing.  Denny, do you understand that we had to cancel our comedy tour because our fans were booing 
[02:10:00]  our comedians?  Well, that's not really true.  Maybe they weren't good comedians.  Maybe they weren't on the level of Jim Norton.  Right.  Bill Burr.  Yeah.  Bill Burr has a lot of trouble getting over.  Yeah.  Well, it was the early days, though.  It was.  And Bill Burr flipped that shit.  They didn't know Bill on the terrestrial side yet.  Nope.  The XM people loved him.  Yeah.  He hadn't been on enough within the terrestrial day.  And that was a lot of terrestrial people.  And then he turned it anyway.  Yeah.  I mean, that's. 
[02:10:30]  You don't think our fans were a problem at those shows?  Because I will find clips of you guys coming on the air.  Nope.  The day after Traveling Virus.  Nope.  And say we're not doing comedy shows anymore because our fans are animals.  Nope.  We never said that.  Pull the tape.  I was no-nated shit on YouTube all the time.  All right.  Play it right now.  I defy you to find it.  Can I have ten minutes?  Nope.  What, are you going to do another intro speech?  You shouldn't talk down to the audience either.  You know, we don't want you to do this.  Don't do that.  I know.  They are adults.  They are adults.  I'm not going to talk to them like they're buffoons who want Hawaiian necklaces either. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, let's make some noise for the boys.  Just having some fun.  But that's what they expect from Denny.  That's what they expect from me.  They expect the cheese.  They expect the hokiness.  Let's do the same thing every time then, Denny.  That's what we do.  We get to the end of this thing.  Please wrap this up.  I feel like I'm reliving this in real time.  Right?  You're the one who brought this dickhead in here.  Wow.  Talk about Mars like that.  More practice. 
[02:11:30]  Everybody's going to have a break.  Everybody's going to have a break.  The show is going to be replayed, of course, on the Opie and Anthony channel and on Raw Dog.  It will be up on SiriusXM.com on demand very quickly.  So, ladies and gentlemen, and I say ladies to represent the four of you that are here.  Good joke.  It's funny.  That's right.  Good joke.  Nice job.  Thanks, Denny.  They were chomping at the pit for a laugh.  I'm in the same boat.  I get it.  Sit back. 
[02:12:00]  Relax.  Act like adults.  And enjoy.  Again talking down.  Oh, stop.  What?  We almost there.  We're almost there.  Sit back.  Get on your feet.  Right.  No, because we don't want that.  Clap your hands to the beat now.  Come on.  Let's hit no beat.  We wouldn't have had the beat going.  We wouldn't have had the beat going.  Stop clapping.  Like a Baptist service.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  And then you said, Opie comes out of one chord.  Nice.  Yes.  Yes.  On to the middle.  Sit back.  They're right to the middle, high-fiving each other. 
[02:12:30]  They meet in the middle.  They meet in the middle.  They meet in the middle.  Jim can't even fake it anymore.  Sit back and relax.  Look at disgust.  That's what that expression is.  He's not feeling too well.  He's thinking about his intro, where he floats in later.  Yes, and I'm also pretending I don't notice that Danny has clear nail polish on those tiny nails.  Oh, why do you have nail polish on?  Huh?  My cuticles.  Just trying to regrow them.  Nail polish doesn't regrow them.  No, you probably bite him, so he's trying to turn himself on.  Oh, I see. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  I just want to have the party party.  He's got faded lipstick on his lips.  He's got a mani-pedi.  He's free time.  It's none of our business.  What do you think the vibe of a Baptist service?  Baptist service?  Yeah.  Why?  What do you mean a Baptist service?  Oh, you mean like a little gospel music and stuff like that?  Yeah, some gospel and stuff.  That might have worked.  No, because it wouldn't have worked, because we don't want people shouting out in the middle  of the Unmanned.  For the Whoopi Goldberg movie?  Sister Act?  Oh, God.  What was that big song?  Are you ready?  What was it again?  Help me out.  The house next door to me. 
[02:13:30]  Help me out.  What was the Queen Latifah one from last year with Dolly Parton?  No, that was good.  Joyful noise was good.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  I got it.  Okay.  Travis got it.  What do you think if we came out to this?  Oh, yeah.  Talk us up a little bit.  Yeah, give us the intro.  She's already singing.  It's okay.  You can talk over it.  You can talk over it.  We understand you're going to break a rule, but we're saying it's okay.  Go.  Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready?  I said, are you ready?  Get on your feet.  Clap your hands to the beat now. 
[02:14:00]  Get it going, get it going.  Let's go, let's go.  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together and welcome the men of the hour.  Let's hear it for Opie.  Are you ready?  Say yeah.  Say yeah.  Opie would have come running out.  Let me hear it by Anthony.  Are you ready?  Say yeah.  Anthony would have come out, high-fiving the crowd.  I mean, the place would have been just a sweat frenzy.  We don't want a sweat frenzy.  Yes, we do. 
[02:14:30]  We're going to sit and watch the interview running through the crowd.  It's a mellow event.  God, I wish this would have happened.  We want a sweat frenzy.  He's right about that.  It's terrible.  No, it's not supposed to be like this.  I think this is cool.  The vibe is cool.  This isn't cool.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the man is going to put it all together tonight.  Run!  Stretch out the run.  See what I'm doing there?  Yeah.  That's perfect.  What a perfect intro.  Then Ronnie would have came out, you know?  He would have came out, like, down the middle, you know, like a coach in a football game. 
[02:15:00]  Sam, you're out.  Denny does all our shows from now on.  That's it.  When we do the 40th anniversary retrospective of these guys.  Well, you'll be dead when that happens.  No, no.  But I'll be a disc jockey in rock and roll heaven.  All right, let's get to the end of the tape.  Denny, please.  Act like adults.  And enjoy.  Yeah, this is a little different than what Denny just did.  The 20th anniversary as they are unmasked by the great Rob Bennington. 
[02:15:30]  Listen to the contrast.  The fun Denny intro that we just went through.  And then.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's horrible.  Now what's happening?  And then music plays.  And then the intro plays.  Jimmy.  God damn it.  Well, Jimmy was thinking about his intro.  I was.  I was getting very excited.  We were actually smelling Sam's intro.  Sometimes the applause startles me.  Wow, it certainly did. 
[02:16:00]  It could have came out on one of those magic carpets.  Like harem girls.  Jimmy got something that was so nice.  That cake you had last night turned into that.  Jimmy got very nervous outside the green room in the hallway right before he went on.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  Did I?  Yeah, you got a mean guest right before you went out there.  Yes, I did.  Thank you.  What about one more thing and then we can move on.  Dan of the Unmasked.  They should have rolled out a big cake, right?  That would have been nice.  Yeah.  Let's get a big cake.  Everybody come up.  A big cake with a 20 on it or something.  Blow out the candles.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  That would have been nice.  It was a cool show.  It was mellow.  It was low-key.  It was not mellow.  What are you talking about?  It wasn't mellow.  You were mellow.  You were mellow.  This is not light rock night.  Why are you making it sound like we...  It's so bad, right?  Why are you making it sound like we wanted it to be mellow?  Holy shit.  We wanted a party like Dennis Falcone could have given us.  How could you put off an in-depth interview with a party going on?  Well, the intro was a party.  And then it just stops?  No, we continue it.  The energy in the room. 
[02:17:00]  That's the lemon cake that we didn't talk about yet.  That was so fucking bad, this one.  It was a cake.  They weren't talking about the cake.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Could have also used the line, we might not be here for a long time, but we sure are going  to have a good time.  Yes.  That's a negative.  That always works.  That's a negative.  Okay.  They said on the air that they weren't going to be there for a long time.  That's a negative, Dennis.  How would you have wrapped up the whole thing?  With a big cake, you think?  I think a big cake would get everybody up on the floor and in a big circle, singing New  York, New York. 
[02:17:30]  Yes!  Yes!  What the fuck?  The classic.  You're useless.  It's been done a thousand times.  But we're in New York.  Yeah.  We're in the heart of Times Square.  Right there.  Crossroads of the world, my friend.  Definitely.  And have the three guys in the middle of the floor, I'll be Anthony and Jimmy, right  there in the middle of the floor.  Yeah.  Right there, right before the song ends.  Usually, I count it down like 15 seconds to go.  Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands up in the air, side to side, and bum rush right  to the middle.  Group hug.  Everybody just goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We would love to group hug. 
[02:18:00]  You want a group hug from the band?  When you get those wedding videos back, it looks awesome.  Wow.  Let me tell you.  This thing would work.  That would have been nice.  A group hug at the end.  Yeah.  Yes.  From all the kind people that tweet you.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you had a great time today.  It brings everyone together.  The haters, the likers, they all come together.  They all come together.  After a win.  One more time.  What do you think of that?  Do they use it for the Yankees?  Jim Norton.  Let's bring it out.  And they're in New York, too.  You stomped over his intro that he did perfectly. 
[02:18:30]  I did.  He did perfectly.  Good.  I'm glad I did that.  Everybody swaying side to side.  Taking their pictures.  The guy's right out there on the center of the dance floor.  I'm picturing it.  Birthday cake comes out now.  Not a birthday cake, but you know what I mean.  A big anniversary type cake.  Can you imagine that?  The lights focus on a big cart with the cake on it rolling out.  Everybody goes crazy.  Everybody arm in arms.  Swing back to side.  Would you have released confetti at this point from the ceiling?  Oh, the confetti guns.  Those are nice.  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, you know what's even better?  Was it in the budget, Sam?  Was it even a thought?  We didn't have time for it.  Confetti guns.  We had to get out of there.  Come on.  Confetti guns.  Plus the crew you have to hire to clean up after that.  We don't have the money for that.  Release balloons from the ceiling.  Balloons would have been nice.  We should have released balloons from the ceiling.  Imagine that.  You know, the seven and a half foot ceilings.  A little production meeting.  That's all.  Just some elements.  We had a production meeting.  And you weren't invited.  Why weren't there balloons involved?  Well, we know to have Denny at the production meetings next time.  He's not welcome.  You see what this means? 
[02:19:30]  He's not welcome.  The song's playing.  People are kind of dancing, clapping.  But now we release the balloons and everyone kind of, like, knocks them around a little bit.  They're batting them around.  Some beach balls.  Yeah, because if we know the ONA fans, it would just be a nice piece.  But it wouldn't be everybody first batting around balloons and then batting around Bobo's face.  And then...  Or, right after...  And to get everybody out to the lobby?  Yeah.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim, the front.  And we play the Venga Boys.  We like to party.  Yes!  The Six Flags.  Yes!  Everybody on the line. 
[02:20:00]  To show that we have a goofy side.  Exactly.  Yes.  And we get everybody on the party line.  I like that.  Out to the lobby.  I like that.  If the Six Flags guy grew hair, it would be Dennis Falcone.  That's what he looks like.  The Six Flags guy who kidnaps kids in his van or whatever.  Right, right.  With hair.  Well, you know he knows how to party.  Just throwing up some shots.  No, I'm throwing up.  Listen, anyone saying Denny Falcone does not a party is an asshole.  Right, because it's every party you've ever been to.  Oh, it's fantastic.  You enjoy them.  It works.  It works.  Ladies and gentlemen.  A number one. 
[02:20:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it one more time.  I'll be having me, Jim Norton.  Of course.  Put your hands up in the air.  Side to side.  Way from side to side.  We're doing it side to side now.  And then Jimmy should have had an exit where he floats back up into the rafter.  Jimmy should only have the floating entrance if he landed like Owen Hart.  That would be an appropriate answer.  Oh, wow.  What's that about, Sam?  That would have sprung the best.  Sour grapes.  A little bitter, are you?  Yes, yes, I already mentioned.  Are you showing up by Denny Falcone?  Yes, I am.  He would have had a bruised knee.  The ceiling, like I said earlier, was seven and a half feet. 
[02:21:00]  Now let's bring it in, everybody.  All right.  This is the group hug.  Yes.  Everybody together.  Bye.  I'm going to hear you singing nice and loud.  People like to sing.  You pretend to put up with him.  No, I like it today.  This is great.  Yeah, he makes some very valid points.  Well, Bill M says, and he's kind of, I thought Sam did the intro, but you had Stephen Wright  do it instead.  Oh, no.  What a price kill.  All right.  Stephen Wright's been very successful on that stage, by the way.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:21:30]  You mean legendary entertainer, Stephen Wright?  Thanks.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I would have cleared away those tables as lickety-split and just get the beats pumping,  get everybody on the dance floor having a good time.  We're not going to have to party, too, right?  What the fuck are you talking about?  If 7-Eleven is open 24 hours, why do they have locks on the doors?  I'm bump all night to get lucky.  I would have just banged that right in there.  Yeah, Macklemore, you know.  Hands up.  There you go.  There's some hands-up songs.  Yeah, we just had a great time. 
[02:22:00]  Did you enjoy the inner circle after party?  What's that?  When you gave out the little cupcakes and stuff?  That was nice.  No, no, no, no, no.  The one that the people in the inner circle went to.  No.  Oh, shit.  I kept coming out and doing some work.  You weren't invited?  No, I wasn't invited.  No, he wasn't.  You weren't invited to dinner?  Because he would have brought his corny-ass shit.  That's not cool, though.  And we wouldn't have had fun.  Dennis, you should have been there.  Not a problem.  I would have sat right next to you.  Thank you very much.  You would have.  Yes.  Would have been a short dinner.  Dennis Falcone wouldn't have thrown cheesecake against a glass wall. 
[02:22:30]  Nobody else would have.  Except Tim Saviour.  It's a hell of an out, though.  Give a warm welcome, but try not to burn anyone.  Everything is workable.  I'm not working on anything with you.  Sit back, relax, and try not to have a good time.  We just would have been going until midnight.  We didn't have the venue until midnight.  We're going to tear the roof off the sucker.  Tear the roof off the sucker.  Pump it up, pump it up, let's go.  It's doing a bit.  This fucking radio failure. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even hear you talking.  He knows how to get the party started.  But it's doing a bit.  No, you know what?  You like Danny's stuff better.  Dennis Falcone knows how to bring the fun.  That's right.  We had the venue until 7.  He brings fun.  When is he DJing again for us?  Soon.  Are we doing another super show?  Yeah, we're going to do it.  I mean, our next super show is scheduled until next month.  Really?  Maybe we could find a...  Maybe we should have had a DJ on Good Friday.  I need you to clear a date in July for my sister's big birthday party at my house. 
[02:23:30]  She asked specifically for Dennis Falcone to DJ her party at my house.  Not Sam Roberts.  Nope.  I'm not a DJ.  No.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's Dawn.  That's got to hurt.  Here's Dawn.  Let's wish her a happy birthday.  Right.  It's nice of Dennis to let you get through at that time.  Look at your birthday.  Doing a party.  Oh, yeah.  Little Fitty Sand.  Look, he's very excited. 
[02:24:00]  I love it.  He's putting the birthday songs together already.  He's already putting it together in his head.  He just has that one-track spectrum attention span.  Oh.  All right, Dennis.  Thank you.  Why don't you drive on a parkway and park in a driveway?  Anyway, sit back and relax.  All right, Sam, you keep working at it, man.  I see good things in your future.  Yeah.  Thanks for the support, Dennis.  I see your future has passed already.  Oh.  That was real.  How did that feel?  That hurts.  I laugh it off, Sam. 
[02:24:30]  Good for you.  This is a long time.  Hey, Dennis.  Take that dirt off your shoulder, right?  It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to carpet it.  Take care, guys.  Give me a feel better.  All right.  Thanks, Dennis.  Dennis Falcone, ladies and gentlemen.  Wow.  He brings the party.  He really does.  He really understands this shit.  He doesn't get it.  When is Unmask going to be rerun?  4 p.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow.  Where?  Here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Eastern.  No more Raw Dog? 
[02:25:00]  That was just a...  That's probably going to be one of them one-and-dones.  Why?  I'm sure Raw Dog will air it somewhere, but I don't have the times.  I wonder if the Raw Dog people liked it.  They better have.  Because we're not on that platform.  No.  No, but...  We were opened up to the entire platform yesterday.  Yes.  It felt nice.  We might actually get some listeners from that.  Hopefully we get some new stuff.  It'd be nice if we come out of the platform once again.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, they should rerun it on Raw Dog.  Why not?  It's not on the platform.  I'll make sure that they do.  Rerun it.  I'll make sure they do. 
[02:25:30]  Yes, they do.  Are we ever going to put it on the podcast?  We'll put it on the podcast.  Oh, yeah.  We'll find a spot during the week, next week to air it.  Without your part, right?  That wasn't part of the show.  Exactly.  It was just a thing.  It wasn't.  It was a doldrums.  Wow.  Let the crowd know a show is about to start.  Let them know what the rules are.  Rules.  Schmools.  No one wants to hear rules, man.  Of course.  I was there to help you.  Ugh.  All right, listen.  I did it for you, okay?  Speaking of podcasts, don't forget the latest one is Remembering Otto from Otto and George. 
[02:26:00]  Otto Peterson.  So make sure you get our latest podcast, please.  It's great.  Could you imagine if Denny would have done all that stuff?  Oh.  How terrible it would have been.  Can I tell you something?  Hey, man.  Come on.  Do you know how quickly Ron Bennington is like, there's no fucking way to do a shtick before  Ronnie doesn't want his branded product.  Well, he's right. 
[02:26:30]  He stepped in?  Yeah, he's like, we're not doing shtick before.  That's too bad.  I'm not mad.  You don't think Ronnie would have liked the fucking tropical necklaces, as he called them,  instead of valets?  No.  And a big cake.  And quite honestly, neither would you.  You felt respected last night, and you can admit that.  You felt like, oh, this is a big moment for us.  We feel respected.  And there's no fucking way if we had done shtick the whole time.  Ronnie wouldn't like these little child moves.  No?  No.  I quite frankly, I don't think any of you three would have either. 
[02:27:00]  I hope he might have, because it would have annoyed people.  And he'd be getting off on that.  Shut up, you ass.  Don't give my tricks away.  I couldn't even clap during this segment.  No, you didn't even want to.  It was making me so revolted.  Yeah.  No, that's the last thing you want to do.  Because it is an interview.  The last thing you want to do is get them crazy.  It's not a party.  It's a sit-down interview in front of an audience.  But I wanted to see you get floated in.  That part I agree.  Floated in would have been good. 
[02:27:30]  Floated.  Yeah, good floating idea.  Oh, man.  Good floating.  I broke wind.  People?  Wind?  No.  Just now.  Oh.  And this morning?  That's that lemon cake.  Man, fucking.  Ugh.  Rotten lemons?  What'd they use?  It was terrible.  This lemon cake.  Jimmy, I was doing good.  I ate very well.  Lemon.  So I'm really all in about getting this shit pile back together.  And then this stupid dessert comes out.  And I saw what they ordered for the table.  And I saw, you know, I'm like, no, no, no. 
[02:28:00]  All right, I'm good.  I'm not going to do dessert.  Nice.  And I'm sitting next to Jimmy.  And Jimmy goes, you've got to try the lemon cake.  I'm like, fuck.  And I had one fork.  And then sliver after sliver after sliver.  I couldn't stop.  You couldn't stop.  I had a little bit of lemon cake.  And I had some, one little bite of the banana thing.  I didn't have that much, though.  No, you were good.  You call it a banana thing?  I wouldn't have said bite.  It was great, man.  Yeah.  What a great dinner.  Why don't we break? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Sure.  And we'll continue to limp along.  Yeah, exactly.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  I dare you to change the channel.  Please don't.

And a good friend.  Bill Burr, everyone.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, what's going on?  Thank you for the big star.  I'll take that.  Hi, Bill.  Oh, you're absolutely a big star.  We remember you when.  I'm like, ah, shit.  We're a little tired today.  We did an unmasked with Ron Bennington last night.  And it went really well, but we were out very late. 
[02:40:30]  We're dragging ass a little bit today.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, nice.  Well, I'm calling you because I'm dragging ass.  I'm fucking jet lagged.  So I'm up.  I'm out here in L.A., but it's like I'm wide awake.  So I figured I haven't been sitting in a while.  Oh, nice.  That's true.  I like this.  Where were you coming from?  I actually took a vacation for like the first time in, I don't know, about nine years.  What'd you do?  I went to France.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You liked it?  To Paris. 
[02:41:00]  I went to Omaha Beach.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, you got to go, man.  No shit.  World War II buffs that you are, man.  Like, you can't fucking believe it.  Like, you go there and they still have all those pillboxes and stuff.  Wow.  Ammunition.  Like, the guy I took the tour with was like, for like over 30 years has been obsessed with  World War II.  So he had all these photos that he had blown up that proved all, like a lot of the shit  that a lot of the tour guides say is like being false. 
[02:41:30]  And he knew all the names of the guys.  And you'd go into like a bunker and you'd be like, Sergeant so-and-so threw a grenade  right in here.  And you'd walk in and there was this shrapnel on the wall.  Wow.  Like the pit, yeah, the divots from it.  And there was like, it was like the little details.  Like in one of those, I was joking about this on my podcast.  And one of the bunkers we walked into, right as you walked into, right in the entrance,  immediately to the right, was this little carved out like, maybe like an inch or two below the 
[02:42:00]  floor, like area to stand.  And it was a shower.  And I guess Hitler, I didn't know, he had gotten gassed in World War I.  So he made sure all of those little pillbox things or whatever the hell you call them had  little showers in them.  Oh, so if they throw gas in there, you could fucking like rinse off?  Well, if you got gassed off, you could get gassed wherever, out in the field or something,  you could run in or wherever the hell it happened.  Oh, and on my podcast, that was like the first, like the softer side of Hitler. 
[02:42:30]  Like I said, it was a lot of literate thing that actually made him somewhat human.  I remember when I got gassed, I had nowhere to shower.  He understands people's struggle.  That's funny.  Wow, that sounds intense.  Blue-eyed troops to get gassed.  Yeah, they need to be able to wash off.  They have a lot of that stuff just laying around still?  Well, I mean, it's not like laying around. 
[02:43:00]  It's like built in.  I mean, it's like the way the Germans built their shit.  Yeah.  This is the funny thing about the Tour.  After hearing about their technology, I think the next car I'm going to buy is going to be German engineers.  Yeah, no shit, right?  How'd they lose that war?  From what I gathered on the Tour, the reason why we beat them, we didn't really outsmart them.  We just kind of out-manufactured them.  We just kept fighting them until they ran out of shit.  Oh, my God.  Dude, their machine guns, this guy was saying, were better, so much superior to ours that when we would kill one, we'd drop our gun and pick up theirs. 
[02:43:30]  The tanks were better, and then like these, you know, the bunkers that they made, we even shot like bazookas and shit at them.  I mean, they just sort of, I mean, they did some damage, but people inside of them were all right.  So, yeah, they definitely...  Just the fact that they're still there is amazing, yeah.  From the makers of Mercedes-Benz comes a pillbox. 
[02:44:00]  And how annoying, why wouldn't the French take that out?  Why would they leave the evidence of the German invasion there?  Yeah, that's an interesting question.  I never thought about it, but...  I think the truth of the matter is that everything was so fucked up after the war, ripping down bunkers was not top on their list.  Rebuilding their fucking country was, and then by the time they finished that, no one really gave a shit anymore to... 
[02:44:30]  And then they realized, wow, people would like to check this out.  Make museums and such.  Tours.  Little details that you'd love.  Like, at one point we were standing, and I thought it was like three, it looked like white rocks, and it was actually cement bags that, like, some German soldiers had dropped, like, 70 years ago.  They got rained on, and then they were hard, and over 70 years, they looked like, like, the bag part, it looks like part of the rock now.  It was...  Holy shit.  You're looking at it going, like, some soldier, German soldier, put those here in, like, you know, whatever, 1945. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Whatever.  It was really...  It really brings home that it really happened, you know?  There's only so much you can get from watching shows.  It's like, that's a thing that, like, yeah, a real guy put these down here, and they're still there.  That's fucked up, man, those little details.  Yeah, and when you actually...  That was, like, a different part of the tour than we went.  We actually come down to Omaha Beach. 
[02:45:30]  It's like...  I don't know.  It's, like, famous.  You look at it, and you, like, recognize it.  Wow.  It's crazy, and you're standing on it.  You don't even feel worthy to be there.  Were people just sunbathing on that beach, or do they, like, try to keep the people away in that regard?  No, they do.  They do during the summer, and the guy who gave the tour says that's the only thing that really makes, like, those veterans of it smile,  is that they see a kid playing on the beach, because that's kind of what they did it for.  Okay.  They don't want everybody sitting there being all, you know, sad and stuff. 
[02:46:00]  I mean, they want you to remember, but, like, dude, I got to tell you, up on the Bluffs is where they have, like, the iconic cemetery there, and it's unreal.  They got that up there, they got, they have the one for all the British soldiers that died.  It's really, uh, that was amazing, because it was, like, all the little, like, details that this guy gave on the tour were just, like, uh, it really was priceless, man.  It was amazing.  Did you, uh, when you were standing on the beach, did you look up at the beach and, and, and see how daunting the job must have been for those guys? 
[02:46:30]  Well, the guy who gave us the tour basically said that they, the, the, the pilots, uh, you know, they were supposed to drop some bombs,  and they didn't hit where they were supposed to hit.  And with, they were, you know, I always thought that there was just, like, thousands of Germans up there on that bluff.  It wasn't, it was just, they were just in these strategic areas with this technology now where you could just mow down. 
[02:47:00]  I mean, those kids came in, and, like, there was, there was nowhere to hide.  Right.  What ended up happening, I guess, in the end, and I know there's going to be a lot of World War II buffs calling and going,  I got this wrong, got that wrong, look, I took one fucking tour, so relax.  There's Bill.  There's the Bill we love.  In the end, like, when we found out, like, what the fuck was happening, they just, they brought in the destroyer stuff, like, 
[02:47:30]  almost beached them, and just turned them sideways and started blasting into the bluffs.  Jesus Christ.  I finally got those guys, dude, it was like, yeah, I mean, it was like...  Fucking battleship guns at the beach.  Oh, yeah.  I'm reading this book on Iwo Jima.  That's another one that was even worse than that, where it was like, this unreal quote where the guy goes,  it wasn't like they were on the island, they were in it.  They were in it, yeah, all the tunnel systems.  Yeah, so we bombed the shit out of it, and it didn't do anything, and then these fucking kids, 19, 20 years old, 
[02:48:00]  I mean, you just sit there, like, like, the only cover was basically after a bomb blew up that didn't kill you,  you dove into that crater, like, like...  It's just insane.  How many dead at that, how many dead there?  Another one, like, somebody's waiting to call up and say I'm a fucking moron,  but it was, for just Americans, I think it was a little over 3,000.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Here's another one, too.  Everybody, you know, always making fun of the French and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like they just surrendered. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  They had 90,000.  It took the Germans six weeks to run them over, and they lost 90,000.  90,000 killed.  That's not just injured.  Jesus Christ.  That's unbelievable.  They put up a hell of a fight, but...  You couldn't fight against what the Nazis had at that point.  And they were right next to them.  They were in a phone booth.  We need to keep it at arm's length, throwing a jab across the Atlantic. 
[02:49:00]  I'm throwing a jab.  Hang on for a few rounds while we built some more shit back in the country.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, they just had to step over an imaginary line that was on a map.  You ever watch those early Tyson videos?  Yeah.  He comes in and he's still wearing the white shorts.  That's what they ran into.  God damn.  History class with Bill.  I like it.  That would be great.  What about, so you, and then you go to Paris. 
[02:49:30]  How are the people, for real?  Dude, they were fucking great, man.  They were, huh?  And we were, me and my wife were over there.  We were speaking French, and they were helping us out.  And they were really, dude, basically, if you're a moron, you get treated like one.  But I will say this, English guy did tell me that they did have to have a national, like, be nice to tourist day over there.  Because one of the number one ways that they make money in France is tourism.  It's the number one, I guess, visited country on the planet.  Wow. 
[02:50:00]  And they did have a bad reputation.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  They had a more than one.  But, dude, I've got to tell you, though, like, you know, it's, it's, it's, I don't even know that it's 50-50.  Because the one thing I have noticed since traveling is coming back is, you know, we're fucking loud.  I can't tell you, dude.  And I hate admitting that.  Because I was always, I always hated people going over to Europe.  And I'm not kissing their ass. 
[02:50:30]  Like, like, one of my favorite things to do when I go over there and do stand-up is start to lead them on like I'm going to trash America.  And then I start bringing up all the fucking horrible shit that they did.  But, dude, we're just, we're just loud, dude.  We're, we're, we're cowboys.  Loud Americans.  Right, right.  Cowboys.  Definitely.  And I sit there and I laugh.  Me and Neil laugh when we're over there.  Because you can, you can spot us a mile away.  I'm not saying we're, we're dumber than they are.  We're just loud. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, yeah.  God, and it's, we make our presence known.  Yeah.  You're a couple of Americans.  But, I mean, it kind of is also what I, what I do love about this country.  But, like, it was funny when we were flying out to France.  There was a lot of French people on it.  And it was just, immediately you felt, you felt like, oh, wow, I need to be a little more polite.  And coming back to the States, it was just, it was like three guys, like, yelling over three rows.  Dude, you getting a beer? 
[02:51:30]  That's it.  Fucking Americans, right?  Right.  Yeah.  How's that Eiffel Tower, Bill?  What's that?  How's the Eiffel Tower?  Oh, man, I, I gotta tell you, uh, that was the best tourist attraction I've ever been to.  Wow.  And I hate tourist attractions.  Really?  Going to them and that type of thing.  But that thing is, that thing is fucking iconic, man.  It was, you just see, you can't believe it.  It basically, you can't believe that you're, uh, you're there.  And I would say Paris is probably the best, uh, looking city. 
[02:52:00]  And that's an understatement.  Just, they, they really understand, uh, like, all their parks, like, you walk into them,  there's all this tree cover.  Uh-huh.  And you just see these beautiful benches and stuff.  Very much like Central Park.  And then almost like with Central Park, when you go with it, the Great Lawn area, how it  opens up and you can see all of, like, uh, Fifth Avenue and, uh, um, whatever the other  one is there on the other side of the park, they have that in, like, every park, except  you're looking at, like, uh, you know, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, 
[02:52:30]  or, uh, the, uh, the Notre Dame, this fucking church.  And then on top of that, they got all these other old buildings and stuff, because, um,  it's weird.  I guess Hitler wanted to destroy Paris, but when he saw it, he couldn't do it.  Ah, another, another softer side of Hitler.  The softer side of Hitler.  That's two for Hitler.  Aw.  Did he really not destroy Paris?  Did he really like it?  Sure, and, uh, you know, he wanted his guys to be able to take, uh, a nice shower.  Yes.  Is that really true?  Do you know that for sure? 
[02:53:00]  That Hitler didn't want to destroy Paris because it was so beautiful?  Yeah, I think he...  Dude, I don't know if any of this is true.  I think as far as, uh, Paris went, yeah, a lot of the architecture he liked.  He told, uh, Albert Speer, uh, that that's kind of what, what he was going for as far as  making his, uh, little kingdom there in, uh, in Germany.  Right.  Um, well, you know, I, I, I remember hearing another fucking thing I overheard in a bar.  I love it.  One of the things, like, in World War I, um, one of the things that kind of led to it was 
[02:53:30]  that Germany felt like they weren't getting any respect and they were also surrounded  on both sides.  There was some sort of treaty, like, England was down with, with Russia, so they felt  surrounded.  They always felt like they were going to be fighting on two fronts.  And then on, like, this cunty feeling snub kind of thing, whenever some prime minister  or a big fucking hoot would go to visit other countries, they would always go to Paris or 
[02:54:00]  vice versa.  People would go to London, but everybody wanted to go to Paris and nobody ever went to Berlin  or Munich.  Uh-huh.  They felt, they felt snubbed.  Oh, shit.  And also, you know, it's not like England and France were fucking nice guys throughout history.  They were always doing land grabs, so maybe it was, uh, some decent paranoia.  I have no fun.  I don't know.  I'm, I'm with you.  Sounds good.  Sounds about right.  Jet lag talking shit. 
[02:54:30]  It sounds about right.  Your minds have to be lit up at this point.  I like it.  No, people are liking the call.  How long did you go for?  I was over there for a couple of weeks.  Wow.  I started in Paris and, um, dude, I'm telling you guys, you've got to fucking go.  It was the greatest.  I went over to that Duolingo.com and I learned how to order beers.  And you learn basically a cab, cab driving and, and, and menu was like the first thing.  Yeah.  And just trying to read it, trying to figure out what the fuck am I, like legumes for some 
[02:55:00]  reason, whatever the fuck.  I thought it was beans.  I was like, what the fuck would I want beans?  I figured out what the fuck would I want.  Legume.  Legume.  What, uh, how many people, uh, speak English over there?  Large percentage?  Pretty much, yeah.  I mean, if you're in Paris, you, you, Paris, you, you, you got a good, uh, you, you're fine.  Yeah.  I mean, Paris is just like, I mean, I mean, that's, it's like what Disney World is trying  to be, basically.  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, I mean, my amount of tourists that are there. 
[02:55:30]  And then, but once we were out in Bayou, uh, was where we stayed to go out to the beaches  of Normandy and everything, that became more of a crapshoot.  And then it was fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then it was kind of like, fuck, how do I communicate?  You know, it was hilarious because I learned enough words and I was in enough situations  I had been in before that I kind of knew what the next question was.  Like renting a car, you know, or it is, Hey, how are you?  Yeah.  You say, hello, do you have a reservation? 
[02:56:00]  And they're saying in a mild minute, you're just like, we.  What you learn to do is to not panic.  You just sit in the pocket and you just let them run their yap and you wait for a word  you recognize or for them to point at something and you start to figure it out.  And it's actually fun.  Holy shit.  You're hilarious.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because immediately you just panic.  Wait, I don't know what the story is saying.  Right, right, right.  By the time they're done, you're like, all right, lash your knees, you start going back 
[02:56:30]  to French class, but you don't, you're just listening and you learn how to say, I'm sorry,  okay, where is, you know, whatever the fuck you want.  And they basically get what you're saying, but then we ended up going down to Saint-Tropez  for the last few days.  And that was fucking, that was fucking hilarious.  The level of wealth.  Oh, really?  Oh, dude.  It was, I was sitting there looking at like, uh, like, you know, it's how dumb I am. 
[02:57:00]  Saint-Tropez, I thought that was in the Caribbean.  Like, I had no idea what the fuck it was.  I wouldn't know where it was on a map.  Yeah, I always, yeah, I always.  No idea.  Oh, we went to Saint-Tropez and blah, blah, blah.  I always thought it was like in the Bahamas or something.  Right, right.  So we go to the, we go down there and it's just like, just this sick level of wealth.  And I'm looking, and my dumb ass, I'm sitting there looking at all the, um, I'm looking  at all like the Ferraris that are going by. 
[02:57:30]  Or people have like Morgans, you know, as handmade fucking cars that make like fucking  30 a year or something.  Yeah.  Those things are driving by.  And I'm, I'm looking at the cars.  And it wasn't until we took, we went on this ferry ride, like 45 minutes, they took you  out of the bay out from the Metatrain, see you back.  And, uh, the guy on the boat was talking about the yachts.  Oh.  I thought the yacht, I thought they were like five, six million bucks.  I knew they were expensive.  And he basically said a yacht, listen to this shit, a yacht is a million dollars a meter. 
[02:58:00]  Okay.  Dude, I'm telling you, there was like 30, 40, 50 foot fucking, I don't know how many meters  that is, but we're looking at like basically a $45 million boat.  So he said it costs 10% of the cost of the boat each year just to keep the thing going.  Wow, man.  He's talking, that's like another, you know, four, five million euros, whatever the fuck  they're spending over there.  Then you got to, to dock the thing was like three grand a day. 
[02:58:30]  Wow.  And you haven't even paid for your crew.  Wow.  Yeah.  Dude, you should have seen me think, we were sitting in a cafe, right?  Right on the water.  And I'm literally looking into a back of this guy's boat, watching his TV.  You know, this is the funniest thing I made, I told this on my podcast.  I thought he was watching a karate movie.  It turned out it was actually Dancing with the Stars.  So it was, I think, is a really an indictment on the direction karate movies have gone in. 
[02:59:00]  There's too much of that flying around and not enough beating the shit out of somebody.  And there were just a ton of those yachts, right?  Just all over the place.  Well, this time we were here, it actually, I guess we missed the, I mean, it gets insane.  Like, it basically starts today.  April 18th is when it starts.  Like, they had like this calendar that you could buy over there, and it had all the months.  And each month, like in January, it was just like a picture of like the sea, and there 
[02:59:30]  was one sailboat.  In February, there was two.  Oh, okay.  Kind of lets you know.  And they were just basically killing that.  But it was definitely one of those places where it was like one road in and one road out.  And yeah, it's just, it's funny watching how super rich people display their wealth too.  I kept thinking of that 50 Cent song, you know, was it I Teach You How to Stunt?  Where like people like, when they first get money, people who never had money when they 
[03:00:00]  get money, you know, just the dumb shit that they do, you know, splashing their money,  big watches.  Half the comics I know, we're morons.  We get a deal, we go out by a big stupid fucking watch.  Just say the name, Patrice.  It's the name we're all thinking of.  He had some impressive watches.  Remember what his face went out and bought that, that he bought a waist-length mink. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, God.  With a hoodie on it and that giant Jesus piece.  Who's that?  We're all idiots.  So, but these guys, what they do is it's a real subtle, like you look at them and they're  more dressed like a douche and then all of a sudden something that they have will just  be, it'll be really classy and just top of the top of the top of the line kind of thing  like it, like a watch or their car or their fucking yacht.  I mean, it was, I can't explain it, but I was sitting there.  I actually learned about money over there because I was saying to me, I go, yeah, you know 
[03:01:00]  what, we're over here blowing money to actually own a yacht, like there's no point in, during  your day, do you not have money coming in?  These guys are making money.  Yeah, right.  They're just sitting here, like they, I don't know what they do.  I don't know who they're oppressing or what's going on, but you got to have that making  money while you're sleeping.  Right, right.  Yeah, they're not, they're not balancing their checkbooks.  If you own a yacht. 
[03:01:30]  Wondering where that yacht payment is coming from.  Trying to figure out if you can dig up enough, you know, dollars for, for the fuel.  Yeah, that you just know you have enough money.  It's just coming in from all directions.  I forgot about that.  But yeah, if you have a fucking yacht, you just, that's hemorrhaging money.  Yes.  Unless, unless you have like, I mean, I don't know how much you'd have to have, but like,  you got to be like, that's like you own a, well, what the fuck am I talking about?  We took the tour on the boat ride and the guy's pointing out houses. 
[03:02:00]  And there was like, somebody there was like from the Middle East, the big oil guy.  There was somebody else that was part of this conglomerate that owns like Louis Vuitton.  All that top end, next top model, like five of the top lines of that high end shit, I guess, is all owned by the same person.  So this person had the house there.  Dude, it was hilarious, man.  And so I took a picture, they had a citadel, they had like this, this port, you know, back in the day, which is hilarious, you know, just looking out to sea, waiting to see where the next conquerors were going to be coming into your fucking bay, right? 
[03:02:30]  Right.  And I looked over and there was all these zillion dollar houses in the middle of one of them.  Actually took a picture, it was this giant house and there was this flagpole and on top of it was like a German, was a German flag.  So I was trying to think, I was like, maybe that's the McLaren guy or something.  Like, it was like that level.  They were like, they were like celebrity, like, but like businessmen. 
[03:03:00]  Right, right.  They're, they're, they're so rich that they enter that celebrity status.  Yeah.  Like if you owned the gap, you'd be a bum over there.  Like if you own Target, like you're fucking, you're considered bridge and tunnel.  It was really, um, it was insane and I blew a ton of cash and I got to fucking go on the road now.  Holy shit, man.  I got to tell you, if you guys ever get a chance, like if you ever go out there, man, like it's the funniest thing. 
[03:03:30]  All of their cafes, all the chairs are just pointed out at the street because you just want to watch everybody going by.  Like I said, most beautiful women I've ever seen in my fucking life.  Wow, really?  No, they were fucking ridiculous.  No, they were fucking ridiculous.  That's great.  That's fucking cool.  I want to go.  Yeah.  I want to go badly.  I've never been over there.  Like, you know, I've been, I've been all over the United States and then, you know, stupid Canada and stupid Mexico and Bahamas.  Let's read into Anthony's all over the United States. 
[03:04:00]  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City.  Exactly.  Foxwoods.  Foxwoods.  Right.  Vegas.  The seven summits of the casino world.  But, yeah, overseas like that.  It's just all, also, there's so much history and it's so old.  Like, you're looking at buildings that were there before the United States was even fucking  a thought.  You can't even comprehend it.  I went to Athens and they just build the new stuff over the old stuff and they incorporate 
[03:04:30]  it in their designs.  You're in a brand new hotel and they have glass walls that show you just ruins that they  didn't want to, you know, take away.  And you're like, how old is that?  And you can't even wrap your head around it because nothing in America is that old, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every once in a while, what, you get a building or something that's five, six hundred years  old.  It's usually the 1800s or 1700s.  But most of it is 1700s tops.  We barely dip into the 1600s as far as buildings go in the States. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  And they're talking like, oh, this was built in the 11, the 11 hundreds once or whatever,  you know?  If you look out here in Los Angeles, they don't give a shit about anything.  They don't save anything.  They pave over everything.  Yeah.  Right.  If you ask at a hotel, you would think, where Bobby Kennedy...  Yes.  Yeah.  They got rid of that, right?  They fucking knocked it down.  They put up like, I think they actually put up like a school or something.  There's a plaque somewhere.  Like, there's like the monkey bars or something like that.  That's so wrong. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  But there's something else funny over there that I wanted to go see, which was, I just  sort of discovered it when I was over there.  I'm like, next time, if I ever get a chance to go again, God willing, I'm going to check  it out.  Those, those chateaus, chateaus that they have out there, which were basically owned by like  the landowners during like the feudal system and just the amount of fucking money these guys  had.  This is one.  I think it's the best looking one.  I don't know the name of it.  And even if I did, I wouldn't butcher your ears with my attempt to pronounce it. 
[03:06:00]  This fucking guy, he built this house.  It's like over a river.  If you look it up, if you look up Spanish, French, that's so, if you have family, just  bring it up.  Like you'll, you'll, you can find it.  And this guy, he built this in one of the sickest houses I've ever seen in my life.  Fucking castle.  And he built it.  It was just for his mistress.  That's how much money this guy had.  Yeah.  Amazing.  That sounds fucking great, man.  I'd really like to check that out.  Yeah.  I've been wanting to travel. 
[03:06:30]  I haven't traveled for just like Bill said for years for vacation.  And I've kind of been really craving that just to go and do nothing and see a place and  not have a gig.  Or even throw maybe just a little gigs in there.  Just easy.  You know what I mean?  A couple of gigs and then stay a few extra days and just check it out.  I just never do it.  I just shut off my cell phone.  I had it off for fucking 17 days.  Wow.  And when I came back, I was sitting there, I said to me, I go, let's see over-under on  how many texts I have when I come back.  She goes, like, 17.  I go, what do you think I get fucking one a day? 
[03:07:00]  She goes, well, you told everybody you're going to be over here.  I go, yeah, but there's always that random, hey, I'm in town, blah, blah, blah.  I turned it on after 17 days.  I had five text messages.  Wow.  I was crushed.  I was crushed.  Bill, you rule.  I was like, there's got to be something wrong with my phone.  I know I'm more popular.  Right, of course.  More than that.  I think I'm a nice guy.  They forgot about me that easily?  What the fuck?  How was your flight over there?  What airline? 
[03:07:30]  I went Air France.  I don't fuck around.  When I'm going to go that long, I use miles.  I fucking fell my soul.  I do whatever I got to do.  Did you have, like, a bed?  To get up to the front.  Yeah, yeah, you're totally reclining.  That's great.  Oh, did you fly first?  What did I fly?  I think I'll just, even if you just fly, like, business class out there on an international flight, it's going to be great.  Yeah, business is amazing.  This one, I might have flown first because it was a vacation and I was bringing my wife.  You know, I'll fly like an animal. 
[03:08:00]  I don't give a shit, but I don't need to listen to, you know, I don't want to fucking listen to much of people chewing food in my fucking ear.  I love it.  I don't want to chew in food in my ear.  I would say the best one I ever flew on was the Air New Zealand.  Really?  Just for the simple fact that we could have flown around the world four times and there's no way I could have even put a dent in the amount of shit that they had for me to watch on the video screen.  It was insane. 
[03:08:30]  Really?  Wow.  They had, like, the entire series of, what's that motorcycle show, Sons of Anarchy?  Yeah, yeah.  I watched, like, eight episodes.  Wow.  A couple of episodes.  Jesus.  That's amazing.  Yeah, you watch, basically, you watch two movies.  Yeah.  You eat a meal and then you fall asleep.  We leave at four in the afternoon.  This is how it works on the West Coast.  So I leave at four in the afternoon.  So I'll watch a couple movies and have a dinner and then I fall asleep and I wake up eight hours later and I'm on final approach to where the fuck I'm at. 
[03:09:00]  Coming back can suck unless you're acclimated to the time over.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Once again, I try to fly at four o'clock and I watch a couple movies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then I pass out.  Like, I stayed awake until Greenland, which is a terrifying place to look down at.  You just think, if we crash land, how quickly, if I survived before a polar bear, that I had absolutely no fear of man, just came walking up. 
[03:09:30]  And I felt that breath on my neck right before I died.  Oh, God.  So I passed out right over Greenland and then came to, like, over Arizona.  Wow.  Wow.  And of course, I'm up at fucking four or five o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  But you could sleep for eight hours on a plane.  That amazes me.  Six hours.  Six hours.  No problem.  Well, no, if you're laying down.  Yeah, that's true.  No, I know, but I'm a fucking...  I'm wide awake.  Yeah, I'm a horrible sleeper.  I don't care how good the bed is. 
[03:10:00]  I cannot do it.  Oh, can I fucking sleep on a plane, man?  Oh, I love it.  I've tried to sleep all the way to L.A. in one of those...  I'm not going to lie to you.  There you go.  Okay, a little nightcap.  I feel a little turbulence and I jump right up like a little pussy boy.  Turbulence helps me sleep.  It, like, rocks me.  It rocks you to sleep.  It does, honestly, yeah.  I suck at sleeping, especially on planes.  Hey, Bill, I got to say, we played it recently.  We might even play it again today.  That Sherry's Berries read of yours.  Holy fuck.  It's becoming legendary from your podcast. 
[03:10:30]  I saw a couple tweets when I was in France.  I was laughing.  I was so glad I didn't get to hear you guys laughing.  That's so fucking hilarious.  My favorite part is right when you lose it.  Right.  Right when it starts, because you can hear it the whole time.  But then it's like, what the fuck is...  Right.  The honesty is great.  It's cracking up.  Oh, shit.  It reminded me of that SNL skit that Alec Baldwin's in, that sweaty balls.  Yeah, sweaty balls.  Sweaty balls.  Right.  My sweaty balls. 
[03:11:00]  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I love it.  People are saying you have another classic read.  We've got to listen to that one.  I forgot what it was for.  You were going through...  Oh, Nature's Box.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nature's Box.  Initially, they didn't like it, and then they started selling berries, and then, of course,  then they were the cool company.  Right.  But Nature's Box, they just were straight up angry.  Oh, right.  Oh, it's Nature's Box, not Nature's Box.  Nature's Box.  All right, we'll have to find that online.  Yeah.  But...  Oh, that's great.  Hey, when are you going to be in New York, Bill? 
[03:11:30]  Any time soon, or...?  I'm doing some gigs in New England and up in Albany, and I don't think I'm going to be  in New York any time in the near future.  I'm getting ready to do another special here in a couple of months, so I'm going to go  hit the road and do that crap.  So I just wanted to rest up before I did it, because, you know...  Where are you shooting?  I think I'm going to do it in San Francisco again.  Oh, nice, nice.  It's just a neat flight for me, the crowds. 
[03:12:00]  It's a great mix of people.  You've got the blue-collar people from Oakland, you've got some liberals, and you've got some  maniacs.  It's perfect.  Yeah, it's a nice mix.  It's a great city.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, all right.  This is Peter and out, guys.  No, no, no, Bill.  Stop.  You were great.  You know, something else.  Bad news.  I did want to say it.  I was devastated, obviously, when I heard...  Oh, yeah.  ...the blue-collar people from Oakland, Bumble, didn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah, that came out of nowhere.  Jesus Christ.  And I wasn't aware that he was sick last year, so that made me feel twice as bad, because 
[03:12:30]  I felt like I didn't do anything for him.  You know, so I wanted to thank you guys for the legendary tours, because I actually got to work with him,  and I went to his Twitter page, and he had a classic one from the infamous Philly run.  Yes.  I think this was the good night, though, because I was smiling at the end of the show.  Yeah.  But it was, like, me, Tracy Morgan, him...  Bob Saget, I think.  I want to say...  I think Jimmy...  I wasn't... 
[03:13:00]  I was not in that shot.  I love that shot.  I wish I was in that.  It's you on the end, and Otto, and Saget, and Tracy, and Bobby, I think.  Yes, I believe that's the picture.  Well, if you didn't tell your listeners, too, man, like, I actually watched Otto...  I watched his Letterman set when he was on Ventriloquist Week, and he just goes...  It's just the balls that that guy has.  Yeah, right.  You know, in the middle of his set, he goes...  He said...  He has...  George is saying to him, and he goes, hey, you know, it's Ventriloquist Week.  He goes, you realize they're making fun of our profession, right? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, right.  Like, it's dressed...  It's just...  It's just what...  It's just why he was one of the great men.  Yeah.  That was obviously, man.  Devastating to hear that.  So, that's what I do.  I keep the gloom right at the front of me.  Thanks, Bill.  Throw that right in your lap.  There you go, guys.  Have a good weekend.  Yeah, thanks.  All right.  All right, Deb, Bill.  I don't know what to tell you.  I'm going to end on that.  Yeah.  Thanks.  See you soon, man.  We'll take it from here.  Thanks, Bill. 
[03:14:00]  Always a pleasure.  Be good, buddy.  Bill Burr, man.  That's great.  Yeah.  Fucking great with Bill.  Holy shit.  He makes you want to travel, though.  Makes you want to go.  He's...  It's only...  He talks about shit only like Bill can fucking talk about.  His perspective is very unique.  God damn, man.  But right on.  Yeah.  If that makes sense.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Let's play the Sherry's Burries thing again.  What the hell?  Yeah, that was fucking great.  And Sherry's Burries is a sponsor of our show.  Yeah.  And I...  Honestly, I do love their product.  Of course.  I took them home. 
[03:14:30]  I eat them.  It's a very easy one to give to people.  You know, chocolate covered strawberries.  Yes.  Strawberries, but for some reason, Bill didn't really understand the concept.  Bill couldn't grasp it.  Yeah.  And it's great.  And the update is, I guess, Sherry's Burries now loves the live read.  They love it.  Let's listen to this again as we go to break.

Kicking it down.  We holding it down for the West Coast.  Yo, I'm just telling y'all, the encore of the Opie and Anthony show is going to start at 11 a.m. on the east  and 8 a.m. for my homies on the west.  Booyah!  So if you miss any of this shit and you want to hear it all again, tune in and check it out. 
[03:28:00]  Tune in and check it out.  Weh, sigh, yee!  Throw them dubs up.  Opie and Anthony have been creating Radio Gold for 20 years.  Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history, here's our 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony Radio Gem.  And welcome, Donald Rumsfeld, to the Opie and Anthony show.  Sir?  Yes, indeed.  How are you?  Very good. 
[03:28:30]  Very good.  What a pleasure to talk to you.  Boy, you have been a part of history in this country for many years, known many presidents.  Welcome to the show, Mr. Rumsfeld.  Well, thank you.  It's a little embarrassing to discover that I've lived one-third of the history of our country.  One-third of the history.  And been involved in a lot of things that have gone on through history.  Here's a guy who, you know, met Eisenhower as a congressman, right?  I was running for Congress, exactly. 
[03:29:00]  And, you know, worked for Ford and Nixon and Reagan and both Bushes.  And there's still those people out there that think, you know, Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are actually lizards.  I mean, literally, there's people that think they're lizards from outer space.  Yeah, that's true.  Who eat human flesh.  I don't know if anybody's ever asked you directly, sir, but are you a lizard?  I don't think he's a lizard.  Actually, can you just please give that a straight answer? 
[03:29:30]  Are you a lizard person?  Louie's a little left-leaning, sir.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Let him answer, are you a lizard?  Here's the short answer.  I'm in New York City.  I walk down the street.  People walk up, shake hands, stop me.  They want an autograph.  He's a lizard.  They want to get a photograph with me.  Go to eat last night at dinner, and Joyce and I were sitting there in the little Italian restaurant.  And a man came up.  He might be a lizard.  He'd like to buy my dinner.  And it turns out I paid for my dinner. 
[03:30:00]  The next thing I know, the waiter comes back and said, the man insisted to pay for your dinner,  and here's your canceled receipt for me.  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  See, there's plenty of people that he's not going to dignify an answer to, are you a lizard, Louie?  Why not?  Because he's not a lizard.  What is the story about getting somebody paid for your dinner?  I would pay for a lizard's dinner.  I think I understood the fact that there are people out there that appreciate what he's done as a leader.  There is plenty of evidence that this guy is a well-decorated and appreciated American. 
[03:30:30]  And he has more credibility than almost anybody.  Exactly.  But I just want to know if he's a lizard.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it.  Mr. Rumsfeld, I want to ask you a little bit about the situation that's going on now in the Middle East.  You are an envoy to the Middle East.  What do you see happening there?  What's your take on the whole situation?  And these are great questions, Anthony, and they're questions that Mr. Rumsfeld is going to answer better than almost anybody in the world.  Yeah.  But I still want to know if he's a lizard.  And if he is...  Stop it. 
[03:31:00]  If he's tasted human flesh.  No, stop.  I just want to know.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, I want to apologize for Louis C.K.  He's an extended comedian.  Look, if he's a lizard who has eaten people...  Don't encourage him.  It'll just make him worse.  See, and I will stop, Mr. Rumsfeld.  The second I get a denial, I'll stop asking.  Tell Louis that my grandchildren are listening.  See?  Well, listen, they have a right to know, too.  No, he's not a lizard, and he's not tasting human flesh. 
[03:31:30]  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  Let me go to Jason in California.  Jason, what's up, buddy?  Seems like you have a problem today.  What's going on out there in California?  What's up, Jason?  Hey, what's up?  That Steven Singer commercial.  You really said orchid and not orchid.  Like the flower, it's a fucking orchid. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that happens sometimes.  Goddamn orchid.  Damn it.  Yep.  I know.  It's okay.  I'm sorry.  Maybe it was an orchard.  He's right.  I'm sorry.  Spend the weekend thinking about that.  You called all the way from California for that, though?  Isn't it like...  I had to.  Do you live by an apple orchard?  You've got a goddamn orchid out here.  You're a whiny chunt.  Yeah, why don't you make better choices?  Oh, there's Don Wicklin.  Danny Don Wicklin.  Danny Don.  Where's his mafia shirt that he had on last night? 
[03:32:30]  He was bright-eyed.  He had a bushy tail.  Did he see his open mafia shirt last night with his fucking hairy Italian chest?  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry, Jason.  Sorry to upset you.  I'll do better next time.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  Should we get Don Wicklin in here?  Sure.  Yeah, definitely.  Let's get him in here.  Get his thoughts on the unmasked.  I think he sent an email out.  Should I read it to everybody?  Guys, I wanted to take this...  I'm going to read this cold, if you guys don't mind. 
[03:33:00]  Go ahead.  Guys, I wanted to take this moment to say congratulations in a different font, by the way.  What?  That's kind of nice when people do that.  It makes sense.  On Opie and Anthony unmasked last night at Caroline's.  Looking back on 20 years of history with Opie and Ant brought back so many memories,  and Ron Bennington, as always, showed his amazing skills as host of the events.  Flawless from beginning to end.  Well.  And showed how many departments involved with this came together and made this a huge success. 
[03:33:30]  Except for the post-it department.  And Sam's opening.  Right.  And a few other things.  I'm reading your email.  Thank you to each one of you for your hard work and coordination over the past weeks.  And help writing another chapter in O&A history.  Don.  There he is.  Don Wicklum.  Slow clap.  Slow clap.  Slow clap.  Slow clap.  After all is said and done. 
[03:34:00]  Went off without a hitch.  It was fucking awesome.  It was fun.  We all had a great, fun time.  So all that bitching and complaining.  See?  And pitching a fit.  Pitching a fit.  You could throw it right back in our face.  Because we were wrong, Rupert.  And you, you were right.  But you're not a good leader.  Mine?  You should have been here early.  Oh, shit.  You should have been suffering alongside us today.  Bastards, really.  We're dragging ass.  I could have used a little extra sack time, as they call it. 
[03:34:30]  You slept in, sir.  No, no.  I was up for the same show.  I listened.  What?  I do.  Oh, but you were home.  And your head was on a pillow.  That's a little different.  You should have been here, sir.  Taking peckers.  That's such a great gag.  Did you see Tim Sabian throw the cheesecake on the glass wall?  Out of control.  Out of control.  He's in charge, right?  He's supposed to be the boss. 
[03:35:00]  God.  It's a hell of an exit, though, he had.  That is a good...  Jimmy's exit was okay.  He did a chip on his way out.  Yeah.  And Tim Sabian threw cheesecake up against the glass wall.  Right at the fucking wall.  And it just stuck.  Did it ever.  Yeah.  And then Roland decided he could do it now.  Yeah.  He's like, if the boss could do it, I could do it.  Well, you're all fine.  Could you call them and apologize?  Because our name's on that shit.  And the painting?  What happened to the painting?  I don't know. 
[03:35:30]  It got cheesecake on it.  Roland.  What's that one, Roland?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Roland.  Roland definitely threw out a couple.  Maybe we should call him and say that Opie and Anthony had nothing to do with the cheesecake on the glass wall.  Yeah.  Tell him it was our boss.  One of the executive vice presidents of the company.  Yes.  Please throw him under the bus.  Had nothing to do with us.  Fucking cheesecake.  And tell him they're lucky that he didn't spray mud all over the place.  Yeah.  He's been known to do that.  In that regard.  What? 
[03:36:00]  We're not allowed to talk about him spraying mud all over the place?  What?  Don?  Don's thumbs up.  I know nothing about it.  I was reading something.  He sprayed mud.  But also that at...  Not at the restaurant last night.  In Howard's bathroom, I guess.  At Scores.  Back in the day.  He apparently picked up a fire extinguisher at Scores and just unloaded it in the...  Is that true?  It's with him.  Why?  He's a madman.  He's fun to party with, though.  He's a fucking nut.  He's a hoot. 
[03:36:30]  He is a hoot.  Yeah.  But after two glasses of wine, he's done for the night and he's got to pack it in.  I'm surprised he's stay out.  He usually goes to bed at 8 o'clock.  Right.  Every night.  Does he really?  Yeah.  What an old lady.  Early bedtime.  Yeah.  When he stays up late and drinks, he throws fucking shit at the wall.  He looks like a monkey.  Well, yeah.  He really is fucking feast or famine.  He's either tucked in with a stocking cap at 8 p.m.  Where he's fucking Mickey Rourke and Barfly.  Drink for my friends!  4 a.m.  A bit of a contrast there. 
[03:37:00]  He did say we were going to be reaching for the brass ring, though.  I like that.  Nice.  True.  That's nice.  I'm at a Goldschlager bottle.  Right.  Right.  Any other thoughts from last night?  It was great.  You know, congrats.  It was really cool.  We forgot to thank Mars.  He was part of the staff.  He was there.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't care if to be there.  He didn't come.  And he drew a picture of his dick today.  Do you want to take a look at it?  Do you want to see?  Yeah.  Call us if this is accurate.  Mars swears this is a pretty good presentation of his dick. 
[03:37:30]  Come on.  That's the head and that's the shadow.  He said that's life-size.  He says that's life-size.  It looks like the Howard logo.  Mars, but you don't...  I'm staring at the front of your pants.  Oh, you're a grower?  Oh, it grows into that monster.  Oh.  Yeah.  It grows to the size of your arm.  Right.  Yeah.  Not even a baby arm.  Your actual arm.  No, it's just an adult arm.  Yeah.  It's no way.  Holding a cantaloupe. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  It looks like a fucking...  Like a fire plug that a steamroller ran over.  Yeah.  That's not what your cock looks like.  Big, bulbous, dumb head.  Kareem palming a basketball.  Can we get it bigger?  Yes.  Exactly.  It's like the earth with the Milky Way on it.  And we get it.  And Mars said he didn't want to go because, you know, he had to get all the way back to  Jersey last night.  Yeah.  He didn't care about the show.  He's trying to get paid, Don.  Doesn't everybody live in Jersey?  No.  Well, that's why I brought it up.  Not you.  Not you.  Not you. 
[03:38:30]  Honestly, I was embarrassed at this shit.  Oh, it's swamp blood.  Yeah.  He's got herpes.  Again?  You could have said, you could have honestly said that you were, like, sparring and somebody  tagged you in the lip.  It doesn't look like that.  It could have.  It was tagging the dick cock.  It could have pinched between your tooth and a fist.  I'm with Mars.  Yeah?  I've had many of those over the years.  You could have lied.  Why don't you punch yourself in the mouth?  You walk around knowing everyone just knows. 
[03:39:00]  And they're not going to buy your day.  It's hard to even notice it unless somebody looks at you.  They're like, hey, herpes guy.  The first thing you do when you look at it, don't you, like, cringe for a second?  Ugh, what's that?  More than a second.  No.  I really don't care.  Back up a little.  Exactly.  I thought it was a problem.  I thought it was just an injury.  Yeah.  I might not have known either, honestly.  That could have just been a little pop from a knuckle or something.  I would have believed it.  Yeah.  Because you spar.  And there's no difference between, I mean, obviously, we know there's a difference because 
[03:39:30]  you told us.  It doesn't look wet enough.  It looks like it's dried up.  It's crusted.  Yeah.  It's in the dried up stage.  So it could have been a punch or something.  And then it bleeds on your pillow every night.  You get those near the end of it.  Oh, really?  From his ass.  More humor.  More ass-fucking jokes.  More ass-fucking bad humor.  Oh, yeah.  Then it goes through the bleeding stage.  Yeah.  Oh, Mars.  What's the whispering all about?  Tell him if the picture's accurate.  I didn't include him on the email.  Oh, shit. 
[03:40:00]  He wasn't there.  Oh, this, uh, yeah.  You weren't there for the big celebration.  So why should you be on the...  Ooh.  Why should you be on the thank you email, basically?  I didn't get it either.  You know my email.  You know, if you're not going to show up.  I was there.  Let's take a look.  See?  Hold on.  Don't give out my email.  I've got to set another one.  I didn't make the email.  What happened?  Oh, did it?  Okay.  It did.  All right, cool.  But Mars not.  Of course not.  Not more.  Well, you weren't there.  What do you mean, of course not?  Yeah. 
[03:40:30]  You were worried about getting back to Jersey by 6.30.  I do.  At night.  Don.  Which one?  Mars doesn't go...  It's like a late event.  Mars doesn't go anywhere unless he's getting a check.  Oh, shit.  Right?  That's absolutely not true.  Wow.  It was the swamp lip testifying.  Oh, yes.  You're trying that Abriva stuff?  I hear that doesn't work.  You've got to do it right in the beginning.  No, right in the beginning.  As soon as you feel the tickle.  Abriva.  Abriva.  Wait, what's it called?  A different mic.  Abriva.  Get away from me. 
[03:41:00]  See how I scare people?  Look, that's going away.  Hey, Abriva.  What's the matter, Chip?  No, I thought I had something.  Did you have something?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's probably going to be funny.  It had to do with Abriva?  Fuck, yeah.  Wait, what happened?  You lost it?  Forgot it.  Oh, man.  You didn't have anything.  It would have been good.  We could use the humor.  Yeah, sometimes a little humor lightens everything.  Yuma.  It's like the place in Arizona.  Yuma.  When's the unmask going to rerun? 
[03:41:30]  I heard you gave out the wrong times earlier.  As a matter of fact, I did.  It's going to be Saturday, 3 p.m. Eastern, Sunday, 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern on this channel.  And then over on the Raw Dog side, tomorrow at 8 p.m. Eastern, and Sunday at 3 p.m. Eastern.  Hope everybody had their pens and papers out to write all that down.  Right?  I wonder if our Everest guy is okay. 
[03:42:00]  The guy that's going to jump from the top.  Look at that shit.  12 killed, 3 missing in Avalanche on Mount Everest.  And he was starting his climb.  That's probably 15 people dead.  Which takes, what, at least a few weeks, if not longer, to get to the top.  So he was absolutely on the mountain.  Yeah, how high up were they?  But a lot of people are on the mountain this time of year, so I don't know.  There's no word yet, so I assume he's all right.  They might not know yet.  Really?  I mean, who knows?  They may not even have any names or anything.  Avalanchey. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, yeah, if they know 12 are dead.  That's crazy.  Imagine dealing with an avalanche on Mount Everest.  A bunch of snow.  Do you die instantly from an avalanche, or do you fucking...  Well, it depends on what it does to you.  You suffocate.  You do?  Yeah, it's the fucking weight of the snow.  Crushes you.  You can't breathe.  But do you think you ever just...  Don't you just start digging yourself out?  Some people do.  It depends on how much snow is on you.  Right.  You know?  There's some kind of protocol you're supposed to...  What?  ...adhere to when you get fucking rolled over if you're still alive.  I think you're supposed to try to clear your arms as best you can and start digging. 
[03:43:00]  Right.  Dig a little space.  Get the weight off your chest, but I don't know.  How do you know if you're digging up or down, too?  How much air do you got?  Does any of that oxygen get through that snow?  A little bit, maybe?  I don't think so.  You might have brought some in with you?  No.  I don't think it's that you run out of space for air.  I think it's the crushing.  You can't breathe.  You physically have too much weight on you.  Oh.  And it packs in like fucking cement.  People have said they've been caught in avalanches, and it's like trying to move cement. 
[03:43:30]  Right.  It's just so packed on top.  How about the guys that brush it off?  It's snow.  Yeah, just brush it away like tantrum.  But they dig you out sometimes.  Sometimes they do.  Your friends come skiing down.  Somehow I don't think on Everest there's, you know, the old fucking St. Bernard with the  brandy around his neck to help you out.  Because they may have been climbing, and it may have actually knocked them off a leg.  They may have fallen a thousand feet and died for impact.  Right.  That's crazy shit, man.  Yeah.  Fuck that snow. 
[03:44:00]  Enough.  I couldn't even handle this winter here.  What?  You didn't need snow.  Would you climb Everest?  That much snow?  No.  Hell no.  I wouldn't even if it was easy.  If it was easy to do, I wouldn't want to just be that cold.  It is easy.  Do you ever go skiing?  I've been skiing with you.  All right.  Remember you woke me up?  Oh, one time.  In the room.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  To find out if I was gay.  I know out of nowhere.  What's the fuck?  Oh, is that what he was doing, the old ski pole thing?  Remember the empties, man?  Check out the empties, man.  You did ski that day. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  I remember you and Jay, of course you skied, but that was probably the only time you ever  skied, right?  I remember you and Jay went up the mountain.  Yep.  And they had one of these, you know, one of those green trails, but it starts from the  top of the mountain.  Yeah.  And we were all at the bottom, like, starting to get really worried because they closed  down everything.  And we were still working our way down.  All the ski lifts and everything.  It was closed for a solid 20, 30 minutes.  We were looking in the bar.  Jay was my drinking buddy, so me and him were hammering skiing down this fucking mountain. 
[03:45:00]  And it took us forever because we kept falling.  And then we...  And we were the emergency crews who were, like, sent up or something.  Well, we saw, yeah, they sent some emergency people up.  I don't know.  And we're like, oh, fuck, is that for them?  And then there were ski patrols.  Yeah, the ski patrol.  And then we looked into, like, the emergency area down below to see if you guys were in  there, the bar, the fires.  We couldn't find you.  And then finally, like, you idiots are giggling like schoolgirls falling every, like, 10 fucking 
[03:45:30]  feet.  Yeah.  We could finally see you guys.  By the way, I love skiing.  I just haven't done it in a couple of years.  Great bit of information on Twitter.  This makes sense.  Yeah.  You drool and dig the opposite way because it goes because of gravity.  So if you're laying there and you drool and it goes over your cheek...  That's a great idea.  You know that you're face down.  Or wait, or face...  Right, face up.  Wait, let's try it.  So if...  But if you're laying face down and you drool...  That's brilliant. 
[03:46:00]  Brilliant fucking method.  That sounds like it shouldn't be brilliant, but it's brilliant.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Who would think that?  It's so simple.  Yeah.  That is fucking brilliant.  Yeah, you drool because if it falls out of your mouth, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dave in Philly.  Dave.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hey, what's going on?  Hold on, Dave.  All right.  What if you're on the side of a mountain, right?  Right.  And it fucking...  You get caught in an avalanche.  Right.  It's very steep.  Right.  Gravity is going to drip your drool down, and it's going to be further to dig out straight 
[03:46:30]  up with gravity because you're on a hill.  Right.  It's cantered.  Right.  Instead of digging out, which would be like almost a 45-degree angle.  And a quicker dig.  Yes.  Maybe, yeah, but it beats digging down into the dirt.  Well, that's true.  Imagine digging for 20 minutes, and you hit rock and dirt, and you're like, oh, sugar.  Sugar, I've got to go the other way.  I'm just living there, having friends come see you.  This guy's going to talk about avalanches in a second. 
[03:47:00]  Cody, stay on the line, but I've got Dave first.  Dave, what's up?  Davey.  What's going on, guys?  Hi.  Didn't you just interview a dude that was probably on the mountain right now?  Yeah, we said that.  Yeah.  That's why...  Okay.  That's how this...  What the hell did the screener put me on for?  I don't know.  No, the whole conversation started.  There was an avalanche on Mount Everest, and we just talked to the guy who's going to...  He's going to jump in one of those...  What the hells?  Wingsuits or whatever, right?  Yeah, you probably just started talking about it as I called it. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, so we're wondering...  We're just wondering if he's okay, but we haven't heard anything, so we're assuming he's fine,  that he's not one of the 12 people dead from the avalanche.  All right.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Dave.  Let me go to this guy.  He knows a little bit about avalanches and suffocating.  It's Cody in Pennsylvania.  Good morning, guys.  How are you doing?  Hello.  Good.  First time, Jimmy is right.  If you do drool, that will give you the orientation of your body.  I got that off of Twitter.  Okay.  Whatever.  But the chances of you digging out are very slim, because it does pack in like concrete. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  Anthony is correct on the crushing weight of the snow, depending on burial depth.  Right.  But most avalanche deaths are from re-breathing your own air.  Really?  That's the CO2 poisoning.  And is it a painful death, or do you just get loopy?  I wouldn't know, because I'm still here talking to you, but I have been in an avalanche, and  if your guys are close, they'll get you out.  If you have avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes, you'll be okay.  If you don't have equipment and nothing's poking through the snow, it's virtually impossible 
[03:48:30]  to find you.  How deep are you?  I know that's a crazy question, but how deep is the average avalanche, put you 10 feet  under snow?  It could be anywhere from a surface burial, which is like, you know, you could be partially  buried and sticking out, or you could be 10, 20 feet, depending on how big the avalanche  is.  Imagine if you were headfirst down, and you feel your tootsies outside, and you got to  shimmy back up.  Shimmy your tootsies?  I'm a notoriously good shimmier.  Unfortunately, you really can't shimmy through metric tons of snow that's frozen. 
[03:49:00]  But there's skiers out in Utah that have had to be dug out in the spring fall, because  they're just too deep, and they can't get them.  So they've been, like, 20 feet down.  What did they say when they got out?  Yeah, exactly.  How did they pass the time?  They just kind of hang out.  And you're one of those guys, you take the helicopters and ski and all that?  I did, yes, sir.  I did a couple years of guiding down in New Zealand.  Wow, that's crazy, man.  How many avalanches have you seen?  Set off, triggered, once or twice a day, we'll set them off by man. 
[03:49:30]  Using explosives or controlled demolition to trigger them.  But man-made avalanche...  Like they did in the World Trade Center.  Yeah, just even say, seriously, you're a fucking pussy.  Either way.  Yeah, man-made, once or twice a day.  Man-triggered, like a guy triggers avalanche.  I've been in one and seen three or four.  But you were actually in an avalanche?  Yeah, I actually got hit from the back.  There's only a partial burial, but yes, I worked hit by an avalanche. 
[03:50:00]  Damn.  Did you see it coming?  No, not at all.  I know, because it hit you in the back.  Did you hear it?  Yeah, what does it sound like?  A train?  Yeah, everything sounds like a train.  Everything that's going to hurt you badly sounds like a train.  Everything sounds like a train.  It sounded like a train coming.  All of a sudden, and not just a train, a freight train.  A freight train.  The tornado, it sounded like a freight train.  The only time you say freight train.  Yeah, I feel a bad ship to it coming, but.  Wait, so you guys, you carry all sorts of equipment just in case you're in an avalanche 
[03:50:30]  so people could find you?  Yeah, it's like a beacon.  It's called an avalanche beacon.  And then you can, it always emits a signal, like a radio signal.  And then other people have a beacon, you can put the search.  And then it's almost like trying to track them via that.  But it's not like GPS.  Yes, it's a pretty complex search pattern to be used.  And then you've got to use a probe, which is basically a long hole.  Yeah, that you're going to hit the guy in the head with.  That's going to suck, right?  Yeah, that's going to suck.  But when you're buried and re-breathing, you're going to die in about 90 minutes. 
[03:51:00]  Getting poked in the head, not exactly a bad sign.  Wait, you could survive 90 minutes?  The maximum avalanche in complete burial is around 90 minutes.  It's about the survival rate.  And then after that, it goes 15% decrease in life for about every 10 minutes.  After about 30 minutes.  Wow, you really know this shit.  Yeah, look at this guy.  After 30 minutes, you're pretty much, the chances of living decreases greatly by the minute. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  Okay.  Crazy.  All right.  Thanks, Cody.  Little avalanche.  There's a thing called an avalung, which is basically a re-breathing system.  It actually pulls oxygen from behind you and then pushes the carbon monoxide out.  What if you're fart?  You're fucked.  Wait, what is it called?  An avalung?  Avalung.  A-V-A-L-U-N-G.  Avalung.  It actually helps to prolong the burial.  Avalung, mate!  Avalung.  Avalung!  Great Jethro Tull song.  Laying under snow. 
[03:52:00]  Oh, Avalung!  So, is it a thing you buy and bring with you?  I'm sorry?  It's a thing you bring with you?  Yes, you actually ski with it on you.  And basically, it'll draw oxygen from in front of your body.  Oh, I don't look like a fairy, Mary.  Yeah, I don't need all that equipment if I'm skiing.  Yeah, may I have fun?  Stupid diving your fairy?  I'm a big fan of, what are the chances?  What are the chances?  What are the chances?  Come on.  You'll be fine.  It's more for backcountry skiers.  Sure, no, I know. 
[03:52:30]  I know.  I know, I'm just making a dumb joke.  Somebody on Twitter by the way.  If you go to Hunter Mountain, I don't think you have to really worry about this stuff.  Somebody said, I told Jimmy how great he was, and he pushed me out of the photo area.  Sir, I don't think I pushed you.  If I did, I was just kidding, because they were rushing over.  We were laughing.  We were embarrassed that they were pushing people through during the photos.  Yeah, but that might have been.  After the unmasked.  Keith called a couple people back, and then he goes, no, no, and shoved them out.  We were just joking.  Oh, God, we were totally joking.  We were completely mortified that they were doing that to everybody.  We just started laughing at each other. 
[03:53:00]  Like, what are they doing?  But then it was kind of nice that it was quick, I guess.  All right, Cody.  Have a good day, boys.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Very good.  Let's see.  Hi, who's this?  It's me.  It's Lady Di.  Hi, Lady Di.  That's exactly what our tired asses need.  How was it still last night?  Great.  It was amazing.  What an amazing event.  You were missed. 
[03:53:30]  I can't believe you didn't show up.  What do you mean I was missed?  I couldn't go to the show.  No, Sam told Marion that we were joking if you wanted to come, just to tell you to come.  Yeah, there were extra seats on the side.  You'll see it in the pictures.  There were these, like, three or four tables, and we're like, well, where the hell is she?  One of these tables is for her.  No, no, no.  Anyway, I couldn't afford to go anyhow.  Why couldn't you afford to go?  I mean, you know, the drinks over there are expensive, and the dinner...  How about you don't drink for a day?  Fucking hell.  I can't stop.  Well, no.  I mean, I could have had water if I wanted to go, actually. 
[03:54:00]  How many beers have you had today?  Right now, this is my third one.  Oh, all right.  Slow day.  Slow start.  Don't say anything.  Don't over here say something to me.  What did he say?  Yeah, what did he say?  It sounded like mill yourself.  Like, I had more than just three.  That's what he's trying to say.  I'm sure you have.  Stop it.  Hey, Jimmy, I heard you this morning. 
[03:54:30]  On 101.  No, really, I did.  I heard him on the Scott Shannon show.  Oh, good.  Oh, good that you listened to this.  Why were you listening to that?  Well, because that's a free radio right there.  You know, 101.1.  And I knew about it yesterday.  Fascinating.  What else?  I know I knew about it yesterday because when I got into my truck to go out and do a little bit of shopping.  More useless information.  Fascinating.  You know how you know she's lying about having only three beers? 
[03:55:00]  Because her name is Lady Di, and we know she lies about everything.  Every time she calls, we say how many of you had, and she says three.  Every time.  Oh, really?  That's her go-to number?  Yeah.  Di, can I say something to you?  And I mean this.  Yes.  You're a drunken slob.  A sock.  You need to stop.  Yes.  What's it going to take?  I figured you'd say that.  I mean that in love.  Stop it, Lady.  Yes.  With love.  Okay.  All right.  I understand that. 
[03:55:30]  Well, you know, it's very hard.  Let me tell you something right now.  Yeah.  You know, for somebody that's been drinking for so many years, okay, it's very hard to  just stop cold turkey.  Well, then don't eat cold turkey.  Talk about your alcoholism.  Cold hippo.  No, no.  Anyway.  No, no.  I'm not.  It's all right.  There's places you can go to accomplish that.  That's right.  How was the show last night?  You already asked that. 
[03:56:00]  I heard a couple of nice things, and you know, of course, you're going to get some  people that are going to Facebook me and everything like that and say a few bad things about me.  Oh, no.  Why?  No one would say that.  What would they say about you?  No.  You know what?  You know what?  A lot of bad things.  You know.  You know what masked had nothing to do with you, right?  The what?  I know that.  I understand that.  All right.  Now, one more thing.  Bobo actually was there, and he showed up.  He was a welcome guest.  More amazing.  Amazing, useless information. 
[03:56:30]  Well, very.  No, no.  That's good.  I'm very happy for him.  But the whole thing is, even if I could show up, I could not afford it.  Well, Marianne was told that you could go, and she was supposed to tell you.  So why were you guys such pains in the asses about it if you knew you weren't going to go anyway?  Well, no.  Bill was going to give me money to go.  Okay.  Was he?  But then Bill decided, I'm not going to give you money to go.  Good for Bill.  Right. 
[03:57:00]  Moment of clarity.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck.  No, no, no.  But anyway, how was the anniversary anyhow?  It's not our anniversary.  Wasn't it your 20th anniversary?  In the summer.  We're doing things all year.  I hope people know that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because if that's what it, you know, we want more than that.  I think they're planning other things throughout the spring and summer.  Marianne and I?  No.  Why not?  Holy fuck, this woman. 
[03:57:30]  Why not?  Why can't we so present to that?  It's a chore just talking.  Right.  You're a huge distraction and a nuisance.  Right.  No, we are not.  Yes, you are.  We would not do that.  Yes, you are.  We would not do that to them.  You know what's interesting?  One of the employees, some of the SiriusXM employees came to the Unmasked, and one of  them was the woman who had the unfortunate duty of cleaning the bathroom four times last time 
[03:58:00]  when you were up here.  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  Just one second.  All right.  I had a bad virus that week.  Okay?  And it was a bad virus.  All right?  I mean, it was like one of those 24-hour things that you have going on.  Hold on.  Hangover.  Shut up.  Yeah.  We're not buying that.  Those are withdrawals.  Yeah, we're not buying that.  Drolls, a hangover, whatever.  Bill got it, too.  Bill just said it.  You're a virus.  Bill is also a drunkard.  Stop at the excuses, please.  Hey, there's a rumor going around that the chicken place where you were mugged at closed 
[03:58:30]  down years ago.  Oh, no.  No, it didn't.  It's still open.  That's why this is a rumor at this point.  But supposedly someone checked it out on Google Map or something, and it was closed down.  No.  No, it's still there.  But, you know, I'm avoiding that place right now.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  I went to the hospital.  I went to the hospital. 
[03:59:00]  Who cares?  Yeah.  Well, Bill had to go to the hospital.  That's how bad he went.  What a terrible existence that is going on in this hovel.  Oh, I thought you meant on this radio show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why do we care that Bill went to the hospital?  The bed bugs, the virus, the fucking drunks, the fucking lying, the muggings, the no job,  the fucking, it's just getting naked in front of ugly Betty, puking in the sink. 
[03:59:30]  The vomiting, the shitting, the fucking squirting, the bleeding, the fucking, you're just a  god fucking disaster.  One more question.  Was that the actual ugly Betty that was on the show?  Yes, the one you showed your genitals to?  Yes.  Yes.  The one you were vomiting in front of.  Guys, I gotta say.  Yeah.  I apologize ahead of time.  Hi, who says?  No.  Oh, no.  Hello?  Oh, hi, Marianne. 
[04:00:00]  How you doing?  Hi, Diane.  Hi, all of you.  Hey, Anthony, hey, Sam never told me that me and Diane was going to go.  Yes, he did.  I heard the tape.  Yes, he did.  He did.  I called the show yesterday and said you were not an asshole.  I told you.  They're this stupid, right?  They have no idea.  And said that because me and Diane couldn't go.  I couldn't go.  You never told me.  Why didn't you tell Di?  Yes, he did.  Not only did we tell you, we had a table reserved for you with your names on it on the side  of the stage.  You had a table reserved for me.  So now I'm embarrassed because there was an empty table. 
[04:00:30]  That's the last time I step up and try to take care of you two.  I mean, you never told me we could go.  Well, you hung up on me after you called Opie and Anthony fucking assholes.  Let me tell you something.  I left it alone.  Let me tell you something.  And I had something to do yesterday.  I had an appointment.  The thing is, you guys are idiots.  Opie Anthony, let me tell you something.  Yeah, I had an appointment to you and I'm glad your show was good.  But you know something? 
[04:01:00]  I hope there were people there last night asking about me and Diane.  Not a one.  Make it a bow for her.  Not a one.  Not a one.  Not a one.  Zero.  They were asking about you.  Don't call me zero because I know there's got to be one or two.  There were.  There were.  There's a bunch of people asking about you.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  I love you.  I love you.  There was a lot of people asking for you last night.  Why didn't you come?  Yeah, we had a table for you.  Oh, my God.  You had a table for us.  Yeah, you tell us the day after you had a table for us.  Well, what are you going to do? 
[04:01:30]  Better late than never, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Better late than never.  Well, next time you guys do something.  Go ahead, Di.  Well, next time when you do something.  I had to remove my headphones halfway.  I know.  I know.  Guys.  Because that fucking shrill voice is like a pterodactyl.  Would you eat your ass?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I'll give you a shrill voice.  I'll put my foot up your ass.  And you know what?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Your tough guy routine ain't going to work with me.  I punch you in the cunt. 
[04:02:00]  How about that?  Exactly.  Fucking to Sam.  Your tough guy routine is getting old.  Yeah.  Why don't you come down here and do just that?  You know where we are.  Listen to this.  You know what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  With a hangover, this is not fun.  What are you going to do, Marion?  What are you going to do?  This tough guy actor is wearing thin with us.  He's wearing thin.  What are you going to do?  You guys are junk for not letting me and Diane go up. 
[04:02:30]  Fucking sock it in a pile of pants.  Pugues on your head.  I'd give you a titty twister.  You told me you didn't want to go.  I'd wrap my whole arm around your fucking long, sagging tits.  Really?  I'll squeeze your kneecaps and give you a purple nurple.  Right.  Saggy, titted old bitch.  Shut up.  Hey, Alfie.  Ah, what tough guy.  Did you guys, hey, did Heidi show up?  She was there.  What do you all behave?  A whole itinerary of who was there? 
[04:03:00]  Everyone was, you were welcome and you didn't want to come.  Everyone that had been involved in the show was there.  Patty was treated like royalty.  Big A was there.  Big A, Paffer Minaki.  Yep.  Black Earl.  Right.  I never hear them anymore.  How dare you not show up?  How dare you?  We're going to fight it.  And, you know, I hope we can...  Then why were the rest of the guys there from the past?  They all came.  All of them.  You're a bag of shite.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  They had a group photo.  Lady Di.  Hey, Lady Di and Marion. 
[04:03:30]  If you could...  Watch out for the tough guy, guys.  Why didn't both of you show up?  You had a ticket for Bobo, but you didn't have a ticket for Diane.  Di, why didn't you show up?  There were two tickets for you and Di.  No, there was not.  Marion.  Go ahead, Di.  You never told me that you had a ticket for us.  Lady Di, I'm sorry that Marion didn't tell you about the tickets we had for you.  And the table.  I'm used to it.  The VIP treatment.  We were going to give you free booze and food. 
[04:04:00]  We had the whole thing set up for you, too.  Go ahead, Marion.  You know what?  You know what?  Why?  Marion, did you get the message about going?  Hey, Di?  Yes.  We did have a...  We told Marion that you guys could go.  You did not, Sam.  Sweet day.  Hold on.  Let's hear from Di.  Di, would you have eaten the free food?  Well, the limo was an afterthought.  We were thinking about it.  The limo, my app.  But we did have the table, the VIP, the bucket of champagne, the wings, and a free tab on 
[04:04:30]  the O&A show.  Yeah, it was all free.  I didn't know you were not going to do that.  Yes, they were.  You never called...  That's why I called you and hung up on you.  What are you saying, tough guy?  Look out.  It's Marion.  Ooh.  Yeah, you big bruiser.  I'm scared of her.  You big bruiser.  Look out.  You know where we are.  Come down here right now.  We're going to scrap.  She could handle herself.  Don't worry about me.  Oh, right.  That fucking tough guy act. 
[04:05:00]  Let me...  Let me...  Shut it.  Let me...  Shut it.  Let me...  Let me...  Shut it.  Shut up.  Okay?  I want to win.  Well, the invite was there.  The invite was there.  That fat ass in your mom jeans.  Shut it.  Not my mom jeans.  You're maybe your mom jeans.  Oh.  Watch out for the tough guy.  You're not a tough guy.  With her fucking minor bird comebacks.  That's great.  You're parrot comebacks.  Mark, maybe you're a mom jeans.  Mark, maybe you're a hair. 
[04:05:30]  Mark, maybe you're a pants.  Shut up.  Get out, man.  Go pound, fuck up your ass.  Goodbye.  Die.  Oh, wow.  There goes tough guy.  What happened?  Tough guy.  There goes tough guy.  You fucking mutant.  You cartoon character.  It's me on the phone again.  Shut up.  We don't...  You too.  What?  Was Bob Levy there?  Yes, everyone was there.  Everybody.  Just keep saying names.  Just keep naming everyone from the show.  Was Dillinger there?  Right.  Was Malcolm X there? 
[04:06:00]  You were the only one...  Was Pete Holmes there?  We had a table.  We had a table set aside for you.  So I don't know why you didn't show up.  Diane...  Marion should have gave you the message.  She was told.  Maybe that's the problem.  Marion absolutely knew there was a table for you with VIP treatment.  She fucked up.  But she was too busy being a tough guy.  Yeah.  She had a bar brawl to settle.  Yeah.  Right.  She didn't tell you because she couldn't get to her phone because her dukes were up.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[04:06:30]  She was knocking somebody's...  She's putting a battery on her shoulder and daring someone to knock it off.  Right.  It was a car battery, that fat pig.  Will you stop babbling over our bitch?  God, you really are a yammering silly goose.  God, and you wonder why you weren't there.  Go ahead, Di.  What are you saying?  Yeah.  What do you even know about this show?  You're yappy.  I know it's your 20th anniversary.  You're yappy.  Name five things we've done on this radio show, please. 
[04:07:00]  Right now.  Go.  Five things?  Yeah.  You want me to name five things?  Oh, God.  No.  No.  No, I don't, actually.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  You're right.  I don't.  Let's see.  Okay.  Are you there?  Yes.  Holy mother of fuck.  Stop stalling, you oinker.  Well, you used to do the silent game for one.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Good.  Road trips for two.  I remember the road trips you said.  I'm not taking a road trip.  Okay.  The virus tour. 
[04:07:30]  That's.  Right.  Okay.  Two.  And, you know, I know you played many a joke on me.  That doesn't count.  No.  Holy shit.  Why are these people fans?  What do they hear?  What are they enjoying?  Come on, you blithering moose.  Three more.  You like that one?  You had the 50-gallon drum challenge, right?  You had an insult.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Now I'm going back.  We used you as the drum. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  And now the new 50-gallon drum challenge is, can you drink less than that in an afternoon?  Whatever it was.  20.  What was that?  Wasn't it the 50-gallon drum challenge?  You said that twice.  It's the one-gallon challenge.  We use a fetus.  Right.  You fucking monster.  Let's see.  What else?  What else?  The silent game I mentioned.  That's ready.  Two more.  Quickly.  It's not going da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Can we get the tough guy back on the line?  Yeah.  Please?  Um, Marion? 
[04:08:30]  You, you.  She's like one of those fucking fighting, drunken Irish gypsies.  Yeah, yeah.  Two more, die.  Come on.  She's not afraid to take anyone on.  Hold on.  Hold on a second, Jimmy.  I'm thinking.  God.  I'm thinking right now.  The only time she's ever lost was to the scale.  She's barely a woman, right?  So you could punch her in the face and get away with it?  Absolutely.  Without people thinking you're punching a girl?  Yes.  Because she does have that tough guy attitude?  Absolutely.  Okay, good.  What?  You went contests a couple of times. 
[04:09:00]  I remember that.  You have no idea what this show is about or what we've done.  What contests?  You don't, you can't even name the benchmark bits we've done over the years.  Well, I really don't want to, I don't want to say anything about the sex for Sam thing  because.  Okay, that's four.  You name that's one.  That's still a bit, you alky.  All right, okay.  And that, you don't have to be a fan to know about that.  Exactly.  Guys, do you have your kid gloves?  You might want to put them on because we've got to be careful because tough guy's calling  back.  All right.  What do you got, tough guy?  Yeah.  What do you got, Jake? 
[04:09:30]  I'm on a...  Hey, Anthony, Anthony.  I'm driving down a parkway.  You know, I wasn't going to see you guys on the radio.  Please, God, let's hear screeching tires.  I'm driving.  My husband's driving.  You shouldn't be calling and texting and driving.  Yeah.  Oh, thank God.  I'm driving.  My husband is...  Listen to that.  I have somewhere to go.  Who's driving the car?  What?  What?  My husband's driving my car.  Oh, yeah.  Who's driving, though?  My husband's driving my car down the park.  What?  Don't drive and text.  Yeah, why are you texting?  Oh.  No, no, no. 
[04:10:00]  Stop texting.  Why are you driving your husband's car?  Of course, Lady Di.  No, no, no.  She's not texting.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is unlistenable.  There I go.  I know.  Look out.  Hi.  Where are you driving to go beat someone up?  Exactly.  What are you going to settle in the parking lot at 11?  Right.  Where are you going to rumble?  There's a score that needs to be settled right.  That's right.  Take that Coppola movie, Rumble Whale.  You never really called us and told us we'll come. 
[04:10:30]  Hopefully she's on our way here.  Uh-oh.  We're going to kick our asses away.  Business.  Let's get out of Dodge while the getting's good.  I'm going to be showing Anthony up for not letting us go.  Oh.  What'd she say?  She's going to beat you, Anthony.  Yeah.  What are you going to do, tough guy?  Look out.  I'm going to beat you.  She's a tough broad.  Right.  I'll knee you right in the stomach.  Oh.  The tits are in the way.  I'm going to smack you in the head.  Oh, watch out for a tough guy. 
[04:11:00]  Why didn't you tell Diana?  Seriously.  No, you didn't tell me.  Yes, we did, Diana.  In the end.  Yes.  We're lying.  We're not lying.  In the end, we felt bad and we opened the doors to everybody that helped us out over  the years and everybody was there except you two.  Yes.  Why didn't you call her yesterday and tell her you had to tell her?  We have a tape of you being told and you don't want to tell her.  Yep.  You know what?  You didn't tell me anything.  I called up Sam yesterday morning and I yelled at him.  Yeah.  And I'm awaiting my apology.  One morning.  Marion, when will you be apologizing? 
[04:11:30]  Do you like her hairdo?  Oh, God.  Look at her dancing.  It's fucked.  That hairdo.  It's despicable.  When does it next get together?  Please apologize.  Yeah, you need to apologize first of all.  That fucking Miss Crabtree hairdo you have.  Holy fuck.  It looks like a Simpsons wig.  I don't got a Crabtree hairdo.  You do.  Oh!  She's right.  Wow.  That was a fucking right hook right there.  She's fucking lightning fast. 
[04:12:00]  Damn it.  I have to go.  Wow.  Let me tell you something.  Next time you guys have a get together, whether we're invited or not, I'm showing up.  Well, that's what a tough guy would do now, right?  Yeah.  Party crasher.  Right.  Wow.  Are you going to bring your crew?  Yeah.  Look out.  Look out.  I need to bring a crew.  I can bring myself.  You have a body like Dolph's Sweet.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many...  How big are your hemorrhoids?  I need to know.  We're looking at your ass right now in this video.  The world wants to know.  Marion, how long have you had that wig?  Yeah, but he wasn't allowed.  But he was there.  What does Bill want?  Yeah.  That fucking hair.  A lot of people might have been there.  Marion, would you have worn a different wig than usual?  Yeah.  Excuse me?  Do you... 
[04:13:00]  Would you have worn, like, a fancy wig to the event?  Or your normal one.  Or your normal one.  Your normal.  Yeah, they did.  No, Lady Di told us, finally, that you have a wig.  What?  That's not your real hair.  Marion, where's your wig?  That you wear a wig, Marion.  I don't wear a wig.  That is my real hair.  I don't wear a wig.  Then you better take it up with Lady Di, because she told us.  Who wears a wig?  Yeah, who wears a wig?  You.  My hair's not falling out.  I don't wear no wig.  Well, Lady Di told us that you wear a wig. 
[04:13:30]  That's all I'm saying.  I don't wear a wig.  Oh, no, no, no.  She said you're a pig.  Oh, that's different.  I don't wear a wig.  I wear a gray wig.  Oh, God.  Good one.  No, I don't wear no wig.  Marion, I never told them that you wear a wig.  Is that your natural?  Is that your natural hair color?  Hey, Marion, is that your natural hair color, Marion?  Yes, it is.  Really?  Is that your natural hair color?  We didn't ask you.  You don't dye your hair?  I'm asking you what's your natural hair. 
[04:14:00]  Whoa, somebody's getting tough with the boys.  You don't dye your hair at all or bleach it?  Hey, Bill, I dye it a little bit in the summer.  You dye it a lot, you gray old lady.  No, no, I ain't old.  I'm a lot younger than you, Bill.  I'm a lot younger than you, Bill.  You're not younger than I ever told that.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  You're like Paul Giamatti.  Hey, I'm a little fishy on it.  Tired of your fucking shitty wig? 
[04:14:30]  How old are you?  None of your business.  Oh, wow.  Look at all.  None of my beeswax.  You have to be at least 62.  That was my number, for real.  Is that right?  62.  I've been on seven cruises in the last three years.  Why, you're 62 years old?  I wish you were at one in North Korea or South Korea.  A nice ferry trip.  A nice ferry trip in South Korea.  Yeah, for my birthday in February.  Yeah.  More useless information from whogivesashit.com.  She was on that ferry.  She walked to one side. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah, I was on the ferry, all right, yeah.  Yeah, you made a capsize.  Yeah, you take a lot of cruises, do you?  Oh, good one.  Your relatives, your relatives won that ferry, that thing.  Bye.  She's talking to Sam.  She was on the side.  Oh, shit.  She got us.  She knew she'd get us and then just punch right out.  Not only does she have a good punch, man, she's good with her words.  She knows how to fucking leave, too.  She's like, yeah, take that with you.  Goodbye.  And it's too bad Lady Di's not on the phone anymore, either.  I know.  Yeah, well, we were done with her anyway.  So, fuck that bitch. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, I mean, I wanted Di to come last night, and then she just hangs up on us, but Marianne just  wouldn't tell her.  Right.  She was looking sexy last time she was up here.  Yeah, it's weird.  Anthony was talking about it after the show.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, what was she?  I don't know why she hung up on us, but Anthony was like talking about...  You talking about Lady Di?  Yeah.  Lady Di's not on the phone anymore?  Yeah, Anthony said she actually looked good, but don't tell her that, because Anthony was  embarrassed.  Well, you know what Anthony said?  You were gone.  What?  Well, he said he absolutely would fuck Lady Di.  Yeah, but he's afraid she would tell everyone.  Yeah.  He doesn't want it to be a public Twitter thing, because Lady Di's so big on Twitter. 
[04:16:00]  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  How big am I on Twitter right now?  You're the biggest thing on Twitter.  I have two Twitter accounts right now.  Oh, wow.  And you must be a big, real celebrity.  Stop it already.  Oh, no.  Tell him to shut up.  Exactly.  Shrunk his back.  Yeah, what is fucking barfly saying?  Right.  Hey, Di, tell Bill he's a piece of shit.  Will you please?  I'm not going to tell him now.  Tell him.  Let him know.  Let him know. 
[04:16:30]  Let him know.  Yes.  They said you're a piece of shit.  Oh, I forgot.  We're dealing with another tough guy.  He's a tough guy.  He sure is.  Him and Marion are in the same room.  Watch out.  Must be crazy.  Who do you fight first?  Hey, Di.  Di.  Let Bill know we all think he's a fruitcake.  Yeah.  What?  Let Bill know we all think he's a fruitcake.  Because he couldn't get up when he was having sex with you.  Yeah, he's a fruitcake.  Tell him right now. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah, he's a fucking puffer.  Fruitcake because you won't have sex with me.  You're fucking ugly.  Oh, man.  You're too fucking ugly.  Holy shit.  That's beautiful.  Oh, my dear Lord.  That's not true.  I ain't mad at my dick.  He's not mad at his dick.  If he's mad at his dick, he would stick it in you.  But he's not mad at his dick.  Well, yeah. 
[04:17:30]  All right, Lady Di, can we go?  Yeah, Lady Di, I've so had it with you.  You should have been there.  I don't know what the fuck happened.  Marion didn't tell you that.  I would absolutely have a conversation with Marion.  Fully comp.  She fucked you over because she was pissed at us.  She was jealous and she couldn't go.  Nobody fucked me over.  Marion kind of fucked you over because in the end, she was mad at us, so she didn't give  you the info.  I don't know what to tell you.  She was jealous.  You would have been treated really well there and gotten free stuff.  Right.  And she couldn't go, so she didn't want you to have it.  And we got some of your fans calling in. 
[04:18:00]  Let's go to Rich in Louisiana.  Rich, you're on with Lady Di.  I know you're a big fan.  Go ahead.  Lady Di.  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  Why don't you shut the fuck up and listen to what these guys are telling you for once  you get drunk, miserable life.  Uh, okay.  Uh, hold on a second.  Who's a drunk?  I guess, I guess I'm considered a drunk.  Considered.  That's right.  Yeah, considered.  Yeah. 
[04:18:30]  And?  In some circles.  Yeah.  Sorry, that went for all kinds and purposes.  You just babble and babble and babble.  Well, Marion does when she's not being a tough guy.  Look out.  Watch out.  When Marion's not talking with her fists.  Right.  Marion has moxie.  Yes.  She'll give you the business.  She has moxie.  Oh my goodness.  I apologize.  That wasn't a fan.  I fucked up.  It's actually Josh in Iowa loves you.  It doesn't matter.  Josh, I know you're a super fan of Lady Di.  Go ahead.  Hello. 
[04:19:00]  Hey.  Hi.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Lady Di.  Somebody needs to come and fucking speedbag you right in the old moose knuckle.  You need to fucking live.  Somebody needs to do it.  He wants to punch you in the cunt a lot.  Plain English.  Speedbag that fucking moose knuckle.  I drive for a living.  If there was a cliff in Iowa, I'd fucking find it in a heartbeat.  Yep.  That's what you do to people, Lady Di.  Yes.  You're a national treasure.  Yes. 
[04:19:30]  Thank you.  Can we go now?  Did you get enough exposure for your ego after missing out on last night?  I was just calling to asking you how was the show.  It was good.  It really was good.  Thanks.  That's good.  I'm very happy.  And we hope we can be at your next event.  Okay?  No.  No.  Why not?  Because Marion blew it.  Marion didn't want you going and getting your cup.  Marion did not blow anything. 
[04:20:00]  Hey, we're telling you something.  We were going to comp you.  We were going to have a car pick you up.  And you were going to get everything.  They comped everybody.  It was free stuff.  You would have got free booze.  They were not going to do that.  I'm telling you something.  They were going to give you free food and a few beverages.  Not 20, but a few.  Guys, there was a car service outside your house.  What do you think?  I'm going to go to New York and drink more than two beverages?  I just...  Hey, listen.  Misses the point every time.  Right.  I just said you would have gotten free beverages and some food. 
[04:20:30]  Oh, my God.  And Marion didn't tell you because deep down she was jealous because she couldn't go.  I don't know if I believe that or not.  I don't care what you believe.  It doesn't matter what you believe.  I'm just telling you.  Yeah.  I hope that you guys had a good time, okay?  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Well, I hope you had fun at home when you could have been with us.  Good for you.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  No matter what.  I was a little mad, but, you know...  Well, be mad at Marion because she's the one who fucked you over. 
[04:21:00]  I would get a phone call into her immediately.  Yeah.  Call her up and go, hey, you fun-blocking pig.  Right.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  We will talk to each other.  All right.  Good.  Talk over each other.  Exactly.  Make sure you straighten her out.  Tackling mess.  Exactly.  Punch the back of her blabar arms.  I love you guys.  That's right.  But call a fucking babar and tell her what you think.  Jesus Christ.  One more thing.  What?  There's never one more thing with you.  One more thing. 
[04:21:30]  I would gladly do the internship again.  Of course you would.  You mean the moment you show your pussy and vomit in the sink?  Hold on.  But not getting paid for it.  What?  That was a radio bit.  I know it was a radio bit.  So we're done with it.  Exactly.  Where have you been?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, lab mouth.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Where have you been to look for a job lately?  I went back over to Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, yeah? 
[04:22:00]  All right?  What did you tell them?  I'm available to shit my pants and vomit in your sink from 10 to 6 every day?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It had nothing to do with that.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, good.  She just clarified.  I thought it might have.  Right.  She didn't tell them that.  You told them you'll definitely not get naked in front of everybody?  Right.  How's it serving the donuts?  How's the application at the dollar store going?  Fucking pig.  Ugly Betty and ugly monster in the same fucking bathroom.  How's the dollar store application going?  Have you checked?  Yeah. 
[04:22:30]  Every time I go there, whenever I buy something, I usually see what's going on and everything.  Like that.  What'd they say?  You know, and, and, and, no, no.  What they say is it's still in the computer and everything like that.  If we need anybody, we're going to give you a call.  Did you read that they've closed down 350 stores nationwide and, uh, they fired a shitload  of people and they had to lower their prices?  Did they?  Family dollar?  No.  Yes.  Yes.  Why?  No, they didn't.  They're going broke.  Yeah. 
[04:23:00]  They changed the name to Family Buck 50.  Get it?  I get it.  Yes.  Put Family Dollar in the fucking, uh, in Google and hit news.  Yeah.  Vagina smells.  Watch what happens.  Oh, God.  There's shit in it.  Okay.  And hit news.  No, I didn't hear anything about that.  That is true.  Her vagina is like a fucking Purdue bag with shit and urine in it that you shake up?  Hmm.  No.  Right.  What does it say?  You don't do stuff like that, Jimmy.  Family Dollar closing down.  Three hundred and seventy stores.  Seventy stores.  Lowering prices to boost sales. 
[04:23:30]  Is Family Dollar on the wrong path?  Family Dollar to cut jobs prices and close three hundred and seventy stores.  Woman who wears diaper and has shit in her vagina applies to Family Dollar.  You don't think they're going to think, oh, boy, this is the woman that will get us all out of this jam?  No.  So Dunkin' Donuts and Family Dollar and Family Dollar's out.  Yep.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, I guess I got to move on then.  When's the last time you vomited in Bill's sink and don't lie? 
[04:24:00]  Tell the truth, Lady Di.  We're your friends.  I don't vomit around here.  When's the last time you vomited in Bill's sink?  Right.  No.  I never did that.  Di, stop lying to us.  Come on.  You puke all the time.  Oh, plus she probably has the beer she needs.  Oh, that's true.  True.  If she feels a little queasy, she probably grabs another Natty.  Want to know something?  What?  Yes.  You want to know something?  What?  All right.  When I feel a little bit of vomit coming up, all right, and Bill can vouch for this because 
[04:24:30]  he already knows, I swallow.  Oh, my God.  You eat your vomit?  So you swallow your vomit?  You're like a dog.  She is.  If I need to puke, I go out and eat some grass.  She eats her own vomit.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  She throws up in her mouth and then she eats it.  Oh, my God.  What breath you must have.  Oh, my God.  And then the ciggies.  Do you smoke ciggies?  I bet you couldn't tell what end you're smelling with her.  No, not at all.  She's just like coughing up in the middle of the living room. 
[04:25:00]  She won't go to the bathroom because she knows that if she vomits, she'll just eat it.  Oh, my God.  How much would you hate, how much would you hate to share Bill's cock with her and kiss  her over it?  Oh.  No, I don't know.  She swallowed the wrong thing.  She swallowed the wrong thing.  That's a cock.  That's what he just said.  That's a cock and cum joke.  Tell Bill to shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Do it.  They said shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  We think Bill's gay because he won't have sex with you. 
[04:25:30]  Tell him that.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  You want to talk to him?  No, no, no.  Just tell him what Jimmy said.  We think he's gay.  We think he's gay because he won't have sex with you.  Oh, they think you're gay because you don't want to have sex with me.  No fucking way, I'm gay.  What'd he say?  No fucking way, I'm gay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, we don't want to talk to him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go.  No.  We do gotta go.  We gotta start our weekends.  Put Bill on the phone.  No, no, no, no, no, no, Jimmy. 
[04:26:00]  Who put Bill on the phone?  No.  Yeah, where's Bill?  Yeah, put Bill on.  No.  All right, hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jimmy.  Hold on, hold on.  No, no, don't put him on.  Don't put him on.  Hold on.  Oh, it's too late.  Oh, God damn.  Just hang up.  What?  Hold on a second.  No.  No.  No.  Don't put him on.  Hold on.  Stay safe.  Where's Bill?  Don't put him on.  Who's this?  Oh, fuck.  Who the fuck do you think it is?  Yeah.  Tough guy.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hi, Bill. 
[04:26:30]  Hey, Bill.  What's up?  How are you guys doing?  Bill, Bill, do us a favor.  Do us a favor for the radio.  Hey, Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Do us a favor for the radio, okay?  Go ahead, Bill.  Lean over and punch her in the face as hard as you can.  No, no.  Hit ladies.  You know, make believe it's equally.  What did he say?  He doesn't hit ladies.  So wait.  When's the last time she puked in your sink, Bill?  Yeah.  I think she swallows.  Have you ever seen puke in your sink?  No, not really.  Oh, no.  How's her breath on a day-to-day basis? 
[04:27:00]  Excuse me, guys.  What?  How's her breath?  Little chunks of hay and feed.  She's some fucking cow.  What?  Her breath.  How's her breath?  Yeah.  Forget it.  All right.  Now they're laying on her belly.  No, not her breath.  What is her breath?  Her breath.  It's funny, man.  No, no, no, no.  She's got a natural shell.  No, what does her breath smell like?  Her mouth.  Her breath. 
[04:27:30]  Her breath.  Oh, she only brushes her teeth.  Yeah, it's good.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Fair enough.  She eats her vomit.  She eats her own vomit.  She smokes cigarettes and eats her own puke, Bill.  She said you'll vouch for the fact that she swallows her vomit.  Right.  I don't get that close.  All right.  You fucked her once, though.  Yeah, you did.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did, Bill.  She fucking fessed up to it and said when you guys first hooked up, you used to fuck.  She said you deep-dicked her.  Right.  Right in her shit-maker. 
[04:28:00]  She said you were a terrible lay.  Yep.  Say what?  She said you got a small dick and you were a terrible fuck, she said.  Oh.  Hey, I'll tell you what.  You guys are a bunch of assholes, but I think you guys are a bunch of assholes.  You guys are pretty good.  You're a real good fuck.  I think we kind of, I think we think the same, uh, as far as you go, bro.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You guys are a real trip. 
[04:28:30]  All right, Bill.  Have a good weekend.  All right, Bill.  Have fun, huh?  Guess what?  I'm going to go fuck the bunny rabbit.  Easter, right?  Yeah, why not?  That's vulgar.  It is.  Yeah.  I know.  All right, we got to go, Bill.  I know.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's great.  All right, see you later, Bill.  Thanks, Bill.  Yeah, you guys, yeah.  He's got the...  Wait, Bill?  Huh?  He's got the Easter rhinoceros over at his house.  You know, you guys are a bunch of jerks, but I think you're still good guys. 
[04:29:00]  Thank you, Bill.  Thank you, Bill.  You're okay yourself.  Exactly.  We do the same thing with the good guys part.  Yeah.  You've got to do your job and you're making money doing it.  Yeah, that's what that's right.  Sam's suede shoes are enraging.  I have suede shoes on, Sam.  Oh, those shoes fucking, your hush puppies really bug me.  Yeah, if it's called B-L-E-W.  We're in suede shoes.  Bill called you gay.  Picks right up on it.  I wear a cowboy boot.  Ah-ha, Sam, you're gay. 
[04:29:30]  Bill can't keep an erection.  Oh, shit.  Comment, Mr. Softy.  You know that's true.  You and your soft dick.  It's documented.  Yeah.  Oh, it is really documented?  That's right.  Whiskey dick.  Lady Di said.  Old linguine dick.  Yeah, exactly.  You're wet noodle.  Old slug pecker.  Yeah.  What's that called?  Al dente?  No, not even al dente.  That means it's a little action.  Yours is overcooked. 
[04:30:00]  Yeah.  It's all mushad.  Well, I got a 29-year-old girlfriend with a three-year-old kid, and she don't think so.  Who, the three-year-old?  You got a boyfriend.  You sick fuck.  He's laughing.  You can't get this guy.  It's the best.  All right, Bill, we really got to go.  Yeah, we got to get out of here, Bill.  We'll talk to you soon.  Have a good weekend.  All right? 
[04:30:30]  You too, guys.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right, sir.  There you go.  A bunch of jerks.  Hello.  No, we're done with you.  We got to go.  We were ending with limp dick.  Put Bill back on.  Yeah, with limp dick.  No!  All right.  Put Bill on.  Yes.  No.  She's out.  She's out.  Oh, shit, Jimmy.  I just love him.  Bill annoying.  Bill sounds, and there's maybe 10 people that are going to get this reference, but Mickey  Jay from the BAB guys.  Yeah, Mickey Jay.  I remember that guy.  He also sounds like fucking the wheelchair friend. 
[04:31:00]  Do you get the go-man-go he did?  I think we have that in our system, Mickey Jay.  It was from our first show ever, me and Ant.  There was a guy.  They called him the mayor of Montauk.  Unfortunately, he was a drunk, and they ended up finding him dead on the beach or something.  He either drowned or just died on the beach near the shoreline.  He used to call the BAB show all the fucking time.  And Bill sounds exactly like him.  It creeps me out every time.  That was 20 years ago.

You would have gave her $1,000 to kiss her.  Yes.  That's what he said.  Tell Bill he's not going to kiss anybody because he's got a limp dick.  Yeah. 
[04:35:30]  No.  Tell him.  This goes on Friday morning in this house.  It's two people drinking and just having inane conversations with each other.  Calling radio shows, talking to fucking.

You know, this person over here tells me, my roommate over here tells me, that he would  give Sandy Cain $1,000 for a kiss.  It's five minutes after when I should have been gone already.  Bill's got a limp dick and he doesn't have $1,000.  He's not doing that.  Wait, wait.  Sam, he does not have a limp dick.  Believe me.  I can't.  I got to go home.  Oh, shit.  This is sexy now.  Bye, lady die.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.

I was, it was only supposed to get to the point where the audience was annoyed.  Right.  Not us.  How did that happen?  We went too long.  How did we end the show on a negative note?  Oh.  I do want to say.  We need Denny to bring it back up.  I do want to say, um, finally getting back on Twitter and, uh, you know, it's going to  sound stupid, but whatever.

DJ Who Kid.  What up, son?  What's up, man?  The brown cheesecake is in the house.  That's right.  Who Kid walked in.  Tim came in.  Our boss, Tim.  Came into the studio at the end of the show.  And Who Kid said,  What up, y'all?  Heard there was a cheesecake fight.  You guys are extremely white, man. 
[04:47:00]  Why is that?  Because all the white people do that.  I throw cheesecake in expensive paintings and expensive restaurants.  Oh, I got you.  Black people would be like,  You know how much that cheesecake costs?  We're going to eat every bite of that.  Wrap that up.  Do not throw it.  Do not crush it.  Anything we don't eat, we will wrap up.  And you will be eating cheesecake for dinner for the next three weeks if possible.  The fact that you guys were fucked up at 10.30 makes it extremely white, too.  10.30?  Well, that's us, too.  Like, I was saying that during the pre-show this morning.  Which, by the way, Who Kid? 
[04:47:30]  I'm here on the air at 6 a.m., okay?  I'm in early call time.  You know when my alarm goes off in the morning?  Like 5?  3.55.  Damn.  3.  You don't have time to fuck or nothing.  55.  I don't have time to fuck or nothing.  It was months ago.  Damn.  Anything for O&A, huh?  Anything for O&A.  And that's what it was.  Months ago, I fucked either.  O or A.  I won't tell you who it was, but I will say anything for O&A.  Big ass nuts.  That's right.  That's what it's all about. 
[04:48:00]  Full of cum.  Giant testicles.  But I don't know if they actually get bigger.  But, I mean, yeah, having a dinner that goes until like 10.30, it's late for us.  Yeah, you're crazy.  Let me go to Will in Colorado.  First caller on today's post show.  What's up, Will?  Hey, Sam.  I think the boys were a little rough on you with your unmasked intro.  So, why didn't you just man up and point out at least you fucking showed up sober? 
[04:48:30]  Well, I mean, honestly, Ant maybe had a couple beers in him, but I think that helped.  I think that helped the unmask.  No.  No, it didn't.  I introed the unmasked a little bit, but it was, you know, the unmasked was yesterday.  It was the big interview that Ron Battington did with Opie and Anthony.  It went on, you did it today, this morning?  Well, we were, yeah, because, look, they asked me to warm up the crowd a little bit and let  them know what kind of was going on. 
[04:49:00]  And so, it was off the air.  It was just for the live audience.  And I went up and whatever, made a couple show jokes and said, put your phones away,  don't use them, and don't yell out shit while the interview is going on, because that's  not the vibe of it.  Oh, I got slaughtered today.  Well, it was crickets?  Well, on stupid Dennis Falcone.  You know Denny, don't you, who kid?  The cancer patient?  Yeah, the cancer patient.  He came in here wanting to know why I hadn't given out Hawaiian necklaces and why there wasn't 
[04:49:30]  any light shows.  He said he would have started in the back.  He would have been playing music.  I was like, this isn't a $15 an hour wedding.  It's a broadcast, for God's sake.  It's a while, but everybody just like, were numb, or they were quiet, or did they cheer?  I got them to cheer, I got them to laugh, but apparently, I sounded like I was at a funeral  dirge.  That's what it sounded like to some of the people in this room today.  Why they always hating on you?  It's just something I got to improve on, I guess. 
[04:50:00]  Come on, man.  I don't know.  You got to stop that hate.  It's a tougher, I always tell them, I preach them to stop hate.  Was it a good Friday for you today, or was it a bad Friday?  It's been a good Friday.  You know why?  Hanging out with you, my buddies, Opie and Anthony and Jim.  So you're good.  Talked to Lady Di on the phone today.  I got to call her roommate a limp dick.  You know, so far, so good.  But I'm a positive person.  That's me.  That's me.  You know, the nigga Jesus died for us today, too.  The what? 
[04:50:30]  You know, Jesus was a black guy.  Well, I don't know if that's confirmed, even if it is.  I pour a little coffee off of my nigga.  I don't think you call him N-word.  That's my nigga.  I think either way, you just call him Jesus.  Well, what do you think black people say when they go to church?  What up, nigga?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I'll take your word for it, but I'm not getting behind that statement.  But I'll take your word for it.  He came out of the cave today.  He came out of the cave, right?  To my knowledge.  To the best of my knowledge.  But I'm not an authority figure on the teachings of the church.  Do you go to church? 
[04:51:00]  Hell no.  I mean, you cheat on your wife on a regular basis.  Oh, yeah.  It says not to commit infidelity in the Bible.  But if I stop, then that word won't be in the Bible no more.  The word sin.  I have to make the word continuously come up.  You know what I'm saying?  Keep it alive.  So you're sinning.  There's no reason to have a Bible if you ain't fucking.  Okay.  That's a good philosophy.  Sal, did you hear that?  I'm going to isolate that.  I want you to write that down.  Obi's got his t-shirts.  I'm going to put out my own t-shirts.  There's no reason to have the Bible if you ain't fucking. 
[04:51:30]  No, my balls are small.  I'm fucking.  You got the big, hairy, whatever, full of cum.  My shit is empty.  Empty.  Empty it out all the time.  I'm about to get a tattoo of sin on my dick.  Yeah, well, that's what it's used for, isn't it?  Should I write sin on my dick?  Sinning.  No, sin on my dick.  Well, I don't know if you can fit the whole word.  Yes, I can.  See that joke?  Why shit ain't that small?  Sin is a very small word, isn't it?  Only three letters.  I'll just put it on one nut.  Steve in Michigan.  How you doing this morning, boys? 
[04:52:00]  How you doing?  What up?  Not too bad.  Hey, Sam, listen, I was listening to the beatdown you got this morning, and I got to  admit, you know, you came off sounding a little pissy.  I mean, it's tough calling.  That's the way he's going to go.  He's going to sit there, and he's going to try to get under your skin, and you kind of  responded like a little girl, and, you know, take your lumps like a man and call it what  it is.  You know, you get your best, but you can't let Denny get under your skin like that, because  then you end up looking like a chump.  I do tend to get a little defensive at times, but I wasn't going to sit there and, like, 
[04:52:30]  say that, yeah, you're right, Denny.  I should have fucking given out hula hoops.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, nobody's saying that, but when you're calling him names, and, I mean, you know, O&A  are clearly goading him to get under your skin, because you respond in kind.  I mean, when you're calling him names, it just makes you look silly, because Denny's  silly.  I mean, come on.  You know that.  Let's be honest.  I'm on a different level than Denny, aren't I?  You're right.  That's a professional.  Thank you. 
[04:53:00]  Thank you, Hoogit.  I should.  I should put myself a little more on a pedestal.  You're right, Steve.  I handled it incorrectly.  What names did you call them?  I call him an idiot.  I call him a dickhead.  You like that one, Adrian?  That was a good one?  Okay.  Yeah.  I said, I believe the phrase was, I think you invited this dickhead in here.  Well, that's what he is.  Denny is a dickhead.  But he's a nice guy.  Yeah, he's a sweet dick.  Is that a higher form of dissing a white person?  Like, you call him a dickhead?  I'm learning it.  No, I feel like dickhead is like one of those things, it was popular years ago, and it's 
[04:53:30]  not used like it used to be.  Oh, yeah.  So, like, when you can really take it out and emphasize the words, just be like dickhead.  People go like, oh, shit!  You know what I mean?  I mean, I haven't heard that, as you would say, in a minute.  So, while Opie was instigating, they were, like, trying to get Denny to go under your  ass.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony were both taking Denny's side.  Jim was listening to Denny and was so furious with the whole thing that he couldn't even 
[04:54:00]  pretend to support Denny.  But, yeah.  Opie and Anthony were, uh...  Your ass got tickled.  My ass did not get tickled.  That means that they annoy you.  Oh.  Oh, is that a slang thing?  Then, yes, my ass got tickled.  Yeah.  I was a very ticklish ass this morning.  Listen, that's all the time we have.  Unmasked will be replayed here on the Opie and Anthony channel and on Raw Dog this weekend.  If you go to twitter.com slash ONA show, you can get all the times and everything there. 
[04:54:30]  Also, Sunday at 3 p.m. Eastern, the Sam Roberts show is on.  This week, I'm airing, you know, we lost Otto Peterson.  Otto Peterson.  Everybody doesn't like the way I say his name.  Uh, Otto Peterson, comedian, uh, from Otto and George, unexpectedly passed away on Sunday.  Wow.  So, uh, a couple years ago, he randomly showed up to my show that was live on a Sunday, and I felt gave it some credibility, you know, because, you know, he's Otto. 
[04:55:00]  Yeah.  Like, oh, shit, Otto's on Sam's show?  Let me listen to this.  And it was a very big deal to me, and I always, uh, felt appreciative over it.  So, this Sunday, I'm going to re-air that appearance from a few years ago on my show.  As well, I'm going to talk to Steve Sharippa from The Sopranos, of course, who knew Otto.  Wow.  Which I had no idea of, but he knew Otto.  Small world.  We'll talk about all that.  Uh, that's all going on this weekend here on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[04:55:30]  So, you're not coming tomorrow, huh?  Coming where?  To Denver, Colorado with me.  No, I'm not going to Denver.  420.  No.  I'm DJing out there with bitches.
