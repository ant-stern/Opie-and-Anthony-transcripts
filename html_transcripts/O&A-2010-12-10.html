<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of the day's broadcast plan, orchestrated by producer E-Rock (filling in for Travis).  E-Rock's "one sheet" included news items like the Democrats' response to Obama, the Surgeon General's smoking warning, a Wikileaks-related arrest, and student protests in England.  The hosts criticized E-Rock's preparation, finding many items outdated or already covered. They also confirmed upcoming guests: Big A (for news), Carrie Fisher, and Dana White (phone interview).  The hosts digressed into discussions about Johnny Carson, a caller's report on a Philadelphia serial killer, Jen Sturger's coverage of the Brett Favre sexting scandal, and E-Rock's sleep apnea. The segment was filled with crude jokes and sexually explicit comments.

The show then moved to a discussion of Opie and Anthony's personal struggles with food and alcohol addiction. Opie detailed his junk food cravings, contrasting them with his girlfriend's seemingly effortless weight maintenance.  They discussed their hangovers and self-loathing related to their weight, using explicit language. This transitioned into outrage over a news story about a Tennessee family whose house burned down due to an unpaid $75 fire service fee. They criticized the firefighters' inaction and the perceived callousness of some conservatives, expanding the discussion to other excessive fees and surcharges, including speeding tickets, tolls, and TV shopping scams. A caller claiming to work for OTB provided humorous, dubious claims.  The hosts critiqued the media's coverage of the house fire, focusing on its visual aspects.  They used explicit language and criticized the government and media.  Carrie Fisher was again mentioned as an upcoming guest.

The discussion of the house fire continued, with Opie and Anthony expressing anger and using highly offensive language towards conservatives and figures like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity. They debated the ethics and logic of the pre-payment system. A caller, identifying as a fire marshal with 21 years of experience, explained the system's rationale, citing "no man's land" areas lacking automatic fire protection.  A heated exchange followed, with Opie and Anthony questioning the morality of watching a house burn, while the fire marshal emphasized legal and logistical aspects.  They also speculated about the homeowner's mental state and made morbid comments about anti-gay activists.

The show then featured Big A, who revealed recent health concerns and weight issues (around 413 pounds) following a recent fall.  Technical difficulties hampered a planned news segment with Big A and Roland.  Carrie Fisher then unexpectedly appeared in the studio. The hosts apologized for the delay.  The interview covered her HBO special, "Wishful Drinking," her Star Wars experiences (including anecdotes about drug use on set and George Lucas), and her thoughts on the Holiday Special.  She discussed her personal life, including finding a deceased person in her bed.  The interview was described as open and honest.

The final segment continued with Carrie Fisher, focusing on her upbringing, relationship with Elizabeth Taylor, substance abuse, career, and personal struggles.  Topics included John Belushi's drug use and death, resentment, and her mental health. A phone call with UFC President Dana White promoted an upcoming event in Montreal and discussed fighters and events. The hosts also discussed their upcoming stand-up shows and promoted the Panasonic Multiflex Shaver.  The conversation included crude humor, profanity, and discussions of drug use.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  It's a fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  It's an controversial team  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, alright  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Can you take the last straw for the watching radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Ah, Friday, yeah  Ah, yeah, I like saying  T-G-I-F 
[00:01:00]  T-G-I-F  Do ya  Do ya really?  Do ya  Do ya  Do the bit  Do the bit  Do the bit  Well, very good news, ladies and gentlemen  We got an action-packed show for you today  Oh my god  Travis is taking the day off today  So in his place  Moving up the chain is E-Rock  The chain of command  Is E-Rock  And he just handed in 
[00:01:30]  Thank God  The one sheet  For the listeners out there  The one sheet is everything to us  Well, we're not  Well, we decide to not just babble back and forth  And just give you a fucking radio magic  Because we're that damn good  We have to rely on this one sheet, right?  Yeah  It's one sheet  It's one sheet  It's basically  Hence the one sheet  All the stuff  That we could go to today  Yeah, people think everything we do is off the cuff  And it is 
[00:02:00]  But the subject matter  We like having a few things to go to  Some thought starters  Some thought starters  Right  It lists the audio clips that we might have  Some stories  Stories  And just the basic news of the day thing  Yeah  Keep your listeners informed  Hey, you're waking up  Having your morning cup of joe  This Friday morning  Well, the stories that we should be talking about today  According to E-Rock  According to E-Rock  There's only four things that happened overnight 
[00:02:30]  That's it  Four lousy things that happened overnight  And these are the four things, according to E-Rock  That we could possibly talk about today  Dems fight back against Obama  Mad Dems  Dems  That's number one  Okay  Surgeon General says  One puff can trigger a heart attack  Ooh  Number two  Number three  16-year-old arrested in pro-Wikileaks cyber attack  Ah  And number four  You got a bunch of students protesting over there in England  And they threw some shit at Prince Charles' car 
[00:03:00]  Ah, what else?  That is it  Ah  Unless  That's everything that's been going on  In a 24-hour period  Or 20-hour period  Unless you want to go with the audio  That he says that we could still go to  All right  We need some audio  One of the clips is Britney Spears' boyfriend maybe beat her  That story is about a week, week and a half old  And I think it was determined that it's not even Britney Spears  Let me just cross that off  But that's still on our sheet like it happened yesterday  I'm just going to cross that off my list with the Sharpie  White guy robs bank in black disguise 
[00:03:30]  But this one down is good  Well, no, no, no  He wrote that twice just to fill up the space  To make it look like there's more stuff in that area  So let me cross one of those out  Man kills father with crossbow  Crap  And Justin Bieber's anti-bullying PSA  Now, didn't we play that like two weeks ago?  It was teased two weeks ago  It was teased two weeks ago  Oh, well  Then we got an actor that gave out his address on Jimmy Kimmel  A TSA spoof  Interview with creepy hand model 
[00:04:00]  Here's one that, wow, I'm so glad we got this  Oprah and Barbara Walters  Oh, well, let me cross that out  Why?  Because I think we heard that yesterday  Oh, oh  We did  I do remember hearing a crying Oprah  Talking about lesbianism  And Barbara Walters, ten fascinating people  And then there's a whole section called stories from yesterday  Oh  Mayor Bloomberg, possibly presidential campaign 
[00:04:30]  We talked about that yesterday  Now, wait, this is interesting  Yeah, go ahead  It says stories from yesterday  And right after the audio it says, you know, Oprah on Barbara Walters  It says, Oprah says she's not gay in stories from yesterday  Right  But it's in the audio, even though we talked about it yesterday  Right, so you crossed that out  I crossed that out  We did that already  We did that  We did the mayor who's going to be possibly a presidential candidate  Yeah, yeah, we talked about that and then went into what a scumbag he is  We did the WikiLeaks cyber war, hackers bring down Swedish government website 
[00:05:00]  We actually did that one two days ago when Mike Baker was in  So that one's two days old  Yes, yesterday, yesterday  And the Chinese meet Kim Jong the second there  I'm going to circle that because it's the only one left  Yeah, I don't think we did that  So possibly we could talk about  Only one left  So I think we could talk about that today  And the Dems fight back against Obama  Did you mean it when you said Kim Jong the second?  Yeah  I want to hug you  Oh, heel  Isn't the sun taking over, though?  That's funny 
[00:05:30]  I think so, yeah  So wouldn't that be Kim Jong the second?  Kim Jong the second?  Let the record show that it looks like the second how it's written here  I'll take my beating  So Chinese meet Kim Jong, heel  And the Dems fight back against Obama  And maybe we could sneak in  Surgeon General says one puff can trigger a heart attack  So we better get going because we got a lot to do today  Yeah, it's a busy little show there  Uh-oh  Wow  That's some  And I'm sure none of the babysitters are here to make sure everything is running smoothly, right? 
[00:06:00]  With everything that's going on lately  The dejected look on Erock's face right now is palpable  His work's being criticized  What's that?  You're trying  No, I know  Well, you were here earlier today  Something to  Well, no  The first part of trying is to get here a little earlier, by the way  Now, what time does Travis come in when he comes in?  He's here before five  Travis and I get in around the same time, which would be between  First of all, okay, look  Don't piggyback yourself on how nice and early Travis gets in and does his job 
[00:06:30]  What do you mean?  We're not  You try to slide that in  I don't understand  Like linking yourself because we're praising that Travis gets in early  Well, I just wanted to let you know that's how I know  No, oh  Because otherwise I would  That's how you should have said it  Yeah  That's a slimy, sneaky way to  That's just how I know  Because otherwise I wouldn't know for sure, but I know for sure  I just want you to know I picked up on that  Don't worry  Don't worry, Sam  We all know you're great  We're not talking about it  Exactly  So what time does Travis get here? 
[00:07:00]  Yes  He gets in between 4.45 and 5, but always before 5, so call it quarter to 5  All right, and with Travis out today, what time did E-Rock come in to kind of do some of his duties?  To pick up the slack  About 5.27  And that's why  That's 45 minutes less time to  The reason we brought that up is because I heard in the background, I'm trying  The first part of  You are trying  The first part of I'm trying is to get here 
[00:07:30]  At a reasonable hour, a reasonable time  They're not going to be happy when they see those aren't highlighted  This is shit  What's not highlighted?  What?  The stories have to be  Any of the stories  No  You highlight the stories so we don't have to read all the nonsense  Are they highlighted?  The interesting parts?  I forgot  Did you hear how under his breath that was?  That was this  No  No  This show  People with podcasts  That broadcast to 100 people are more prepared than this 
[00:08:00]  We're supposed to be a big radio show  No  We'll never be a big radio show  I'll finally admit it  No  Oh, we rock  I'll finally admit it  Try to get Stump Brain back  Hey  Right?  He was good  Stunty  What part of this is trying, E-Rock?  Seriously  The whole thing is very trying  What part of this is trying?  I really need to know  We have four things to talk about, maybe  That's a fair question  Is that your wedding band? 
[00:08:30]  Is that black?  What is it called?  Metal  Titanium Ceramic  He's half asleep still  And that was from the great Stephen Singer?  Yes  Of course it was  I was wondering what that  Did you get to bed late?  It happened  No  You didn't?  No  Is that gel there or are you just sweating right now?  That's gel  Okay 
[00:09:00]  Just making sure you're okay  And the babysitters did their weekly get up early yesterday, I guess  So we won't see them for another week  Well, one of my bosses was here early, yes  I mean yesterday, not today  So we won't see them for another week or two  Until after the show  That's smart  They'll be here soon  Anyway, A-Rock, what's up?  Hey, who's at my house?  What's going on?  Well, I tried  I'm not used to doing this  Because this usually wasn't for my  Just for the listeners  By this he means work  I knew that was coming out of someone 
[00:09:30]  I'm close to help  I know  But since the last time we broadcasted  There's only four real important stories today  Is that possible?  Well, no, there's some other stories  But those I thought were the bigger headlines  So I put them on this sheet  Ooh  Yeah  Prince Charles' car getting egged  Is a huge fucking story  That's very big  It's across the pond  Yeah  It's topical  With the wedding coming up for the little princes 
[00:10:00]  Plus on top of it, Danny's out today too  Which didn't influence you  Setting your alarm clock a little earlier, huh?  But Kenny just noticed  That you can tell he's hard at work  Because he's got a pen behind his ear  Knowing that we would be down two guys  Not even a thought in your head  To maybe move that alarm clock  And get up slightly earlier, huh?  He got here earlier than usual  Oh, when is he usually in here? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, he's not usually here at 527  When is he usually here?  Five  Fifty or so  Five forty-five  So you feel like you're doing the show a favor  By getting here at 527  Whatever  Like I said, I know it will never be a big show  We'll just fucking plow through this shit  One more day  I like a languishing in mediocrity  Yeah, it's wonderful  It's fun  I think we could do it 
[00:11:00]  And then the guys, they get mad  Because we beat them up  They're not even aware of what's going on  That's wonderful  You know why?  Because you could always look better  Yeah  When you're mediocre  Is that it?  You just gotta do one little thing  One time a week  And you look like, wow  That's a hero  Aim low and you'll always succeed  I like that  What are we doing on the show today?  You have Big A coming in  Ooh  He's gonna read the news  Good  There's only four stories  I got that 
[00:11:30]  We'll zip right through these  Carrie Fisher's coming in at 9  Dana White's gonna do a phoner at 945  And  I can read all that  Like, what are we doing today?  What else?  Let's see, what else?  We do have, like, four hours to fill  Well, you could talk about  Kids going on expensive buying sprees  On their iPhones  Using their parents' accounts  Ah  Alright  How about the other three hours? 
[00:12:00]  We have a kayaker  Who's presumed dead  After being attacked by a crocodile  Oh  Got a lot of live reads  That'll take some time  I love those  They got, like, 11 of those  Those are great  You can compare me to  This, uh, fat lady here  Alright  There's a giant fat lady in the news  Ah, you're right  I love it 
[00:12:30]  I would not do that  He bit the cyanide capsule  Before he was shot  That's great  I know  Oh, fantastic  There's no reason to do that  Yeah  Man  Um  Surgeon General  Again, cigarettes are bad for you  And, uh  I haven't heard that  I'm sure Ant has a lot  To rant about the Obama  Uh, cutting the, uh  The, uh  Tax credits for, uh  For the rich  Well, he's  He's not 
[00:13:00]  He's not  And that's  We kind of did that whole bit  They kind of caucused  And was rah-rah-ing that  And then  And then  It's still gonna  Yeah  Go through  I mean  Wait, what's still gonna go through?  The, uh, tax  The, the Bush-era tax cuts  Are staying  Yeah, yeah  There's still  The Democrats are very angry about it  Why?  And they  They talked amongst themselves  And they want another  Uh, shot at things  And they're mad at Obama  About it  But, um  Obama's fucked  How out of touch are they  To want those taxes  To come back? 
[00:13:30]  Uh, well, they  They're kind of in a  Hard position  Because you got like  Either everyone's getting  Their taxes raised  At the first of the year  Or  They have to figure it out  So only the rich  Will be taxed  But with the Republicans  They're not gonna go along with that  And a few Democrats aren't either  So  Obama's in a position  To either  Give everyone  The extension on the tax break  Or no one  Or no one  Good  And if he gives no one  It looks like he's the  Raised tax on the lower 
[00:14:00]  And middle class guy  Um  Yeah  Great  He painted himself  Into that little corner  So  Yeah, so that's  That's that break  Alright  It really is  That break  Cozy minute  So  Maybe the listeners  Could produce the show today  Troy's complaining  Can I read this?  Oh, sure  Troy's complaining  That Eric should be doing his job  Running the board right now  Oh, man  Jeez  From every angle  Mm-hmm  What's happening?  You sleepy?  This is anemic 
[00:14:30]  Though  It's not even  Close to good  That was funny  Because you said that to him  When he walked in  And he goes  You mean  Thin?  This is really bad  For a show of our caliber  Yeah, whatever  It'll be over soon  Yeah  Soon enough  Alrighty, thanks  Only place to go from here  Is up, though  Yeah  That's true  Yeah 
[00:15:00]  See, whatever  This is supposed to be all highlighted  Just read the whole article  See, because  You got time  We got four hours  Yeah  Every article has a lot of shit in it  That, you know  You don't need to read  To get to the meat of an article  So we usually highlight everything  That's what makes us different  From a newspaper  So I guess I'll just guess  Which paragraphs to read  Just read the good ones 
[00:15:30]  Alright  How's everybody today?  Which on New York Post?  By the way  By the way  That's the newspaper  Yeah  With the tax deal  Because what Iraq  Kind of thought  The Democrats are very angry  They're livid with the tax package  But the White House  Is pretty much blown off  The Democrats  That's why they're mad  And meeting with Senate Republicans  To work the deal out  And even the  Gibbs said 
[00:16:00]  This will pass  So  They're going to try to alter it  In some way, shape, or form  But I think it's going to be  About a two-year extension  On the Bush tax cuts  For everybody  Right  And there  Alright  You're filled in  On your tax cut  Information  All your tax  We're your tax cut station  Tax cunts  Tax cunts  I could just say that  And I've watched these before  But last night 
[00:16:30]  I was watching  The Johnny Carson  Classic highlights  From the 60s  70s  80s  Early 90s  Just fucking  Unbelievably funny  Some of the shit  Is like dated  And you're just kind of like  Or douchey  Or whatever  But I mean  The majority of that shit  When you watch him  With those  Dumb fucking animals  He was a  Oot  And everybody has been  Copying him since  Trying to  I don't think anyone  Did the animal thing 
[00:17:00]  Before Johnny Carson  Right?  No  When they brought  When they would bring  Those fucking animals  And they  And Johnny would handle them  And they're just like  He's laughing his ass off  They're trying to bite him  He had a bat  A fucking bat  In front of him  And it just lunged  At his face  And the faces  He could make  And just look into  The camera like that  Freaking brilliant  And then with guests  Like  You know  He'd have  Little kids  Uncle Paul  On the chair  And just be able  To do an interview  Like that  He could do an interview 
[00:17:30]  With the  A-list  Fucking celebrities  You know  You'd have  Fucking Sinatra  Out there  And Dino  And the whole  Rat Pack  And those things  And then just  Some woman  That had potato chips  In various shapes  Which was hysterical  Because he's looking  At those  And she turned  For a second  And he had a bowl  Of chips behind him  And he grabbed one  And crunches it  And she turned around  And almost had a  Fucking heart attack  She thought he ate  One of her chips  And he's like  No no look  And he's holding  The bowl up  And it was all genuine 
[00:18:00]  And one of the funniest  Things was  Ed McMahon  Started talking about  Some bit  They were doing  And Johnny's  Looking at Ed  And it's obvious  Ed is drunk  Off his ass  And Johnny's like  It's okay  You can calm down  And then he finally  Like Ed is just  Babbling  And he finally  Johnny just turns  To him and goes  You think you're  Fooling anyone?  Fucking great  And then a goat  Or some shit  Started drinking  Ed's drink  And all they were doing 
[00:18:30]  Is making how  Drunk goat jokes  It's fucking  Hysterically funny  That was  There's nothing  Funnier than  The Carson  Tonight Show  He's just the  Funniest guy  You watch that  And you just look  At other talk shows  And just go  You know  Some are good  Some aren't  But none  Even come close  To what that  Fucking guy did  For all those years  On television  Just an amazing job  When he's getting  That massage  Foot massage  This woman's walking 
[00:19:00]  On his back  And they had like  They had a hot tub  Segment  And a woman's  Walking on his back  And he's just  In his underwear  And Rickles comes out  And grabs him  And starts kissing him  And Johnny's getting  Like get away from me  He picks Don Rickles up  In a suit  And just throws him  In the hot tub  And you know  That wasn't a  Planned bit thing  Just from the reaction  It was  Very fucking funny  When he stands up  And he spits out the water  Yeah he just spits  The water out at him  And then they start  Taking buckets  Of water  And throwing it 
[00:19:30]  At each other  It was great  Spontaneous stuff  Just stuff that was  You know I remember  Growing up as a  Wee little lad  Watching it  When I could stay up late  And now when you  Watch those clips  It's just  I was literally  LOLing  At a lot of that shit  Is it a box set  Or  Yeah  There's a few of them  Out there  And people were asking  Which one it was  Yes I am  I'm talking about  Carson Daly  Not Johnny Carson  What an ass  That's really funny  By the way  You don't have to sit  Through full episodes 
[00:20:00]  Right  Because a lot of that  Stuff would be nonsense  They're highlights  They're  Oh see that's beautiful  All the highlights  There's funny fucking shit  That's beautiful  When that  Ed Ames was it  When he throws the hatchet  It's a classic clip  He's Tonto  Yeah Tonto  And he throws the fucking  Tomahawk at the target  And it hits it  Right in the cock  And the handle  Of the tomahawk  Is sticking up like a rod  And the thing is in there  And the laugh goes on  For a good  Almost a minute  And there's a moment  Where Ed Ames  Is about to walk over  And grab it 
[00:20:30]  And take it out  And Johnny stops him  Johnny stops him  Because he knows  What's fucking funny  This is  This is comedy  And then  And then Johnny  Just blurts out  He goes  I didn't even know  You were Jewish  It's fucking classic  I didn't even know  You were Jewish  Another minute long  Laugh and applause break  Funny shit  Hysterical  I love the old car  You know a lot of his stuff  Was taped over too  NBC to save money  Started taping over  Old shows  Oh brilliant  There are episodes  Of the Tonight Show  Which are

[00:26:00]  Beautiful  Mount Harry Lodge  Where love lives  My friend  You ever go there  No  Never  You live near it  No I only  I only work  In the Poconos  I live like  80 miles away  Oh what do you  Clean the fucking  Skimmers on the  Cum pools  At the Mount  Harry Lodge  Or whatever  It isn't even there  Anywhere is it  The Mount  Harry Lodge  I think it's  Caesars  Is the only one  Left  Caesars  What do you got  For the show  Anyways yeah  The first ten minutes  Of like six to ten 
[00:26:30]  When you guys  Aren't on yet  I'm listening to  Fox News  And they covered  All four of those  Stories  Within ten minutes  Oh no  Then we're in deep  Trouble  Yes but they don't  Give you the comedy  And insight  That the Opie and  Anthony program do  Could if we  Right  Alright  Alright I'm out  Yes you are  We're not itch  Out of anything  Good to say  We're not itchy bonning  That's Ronnie's bit  But if you got  Something that  I don't even know  What that means  If you got something  That E-Rock didn't cover  On his amazing  One sheet  We'd really like  To hear from you today  I guess he didn't 
[00:27:00]  Think the Jen Sturger  Story was important  Nah that's not  Really good  No huh  Oh yeah I would  Think that was important  Jen Sturger obviously  Is the girl that got  The cock photos  From Brett Favre  Lucky  You say the lucky girl  And she has nothing  On Brett Favre  But she's trying to  Keep her stupid face  In the press  She wasn't affected  You really don't like her  She wasn't affected  No I didn't like her  When she was in here  You didn't  No I did not  I was working  So I didn't know  I know you were working  I didn't know  Like I didn't really  Get a good  Background on her  Or anything  I was just  I had primary focus  So I didn't see her 
[00:27:30]  As everyone else saw her  I saw her as  Primary target  Attention load  Well she sees  She sees herself  Very differently too  Yeah  And she's trying  To keep her face  In the press  She wasn't affected  By Brett Favre's  Cock pictures  My humble opinion  Okay  But to get a story  Out  Weekly  The latest on her  Is if  If  The NFL  Does something  About Brett Favre  And fine him  Or suspend him  Or do some  Kind of  Disciplinary actions 
[00:28:00]  Then she will not  Sue  Brett Favre  That's what she's  Saying today  What is she gonna  Sue him  She wasn't affected  By this  You wonder why  We don't want  Women around  In these environments  It's like  Just fucking  Stay home  And she's asking  For an NFL  Anti-harassment  Program  Ugh  No  She doesn't  Believe in anything  She's saying  She's just trying  To keep her  Her face in the news  That's what  That's what  These low level  Celebrities do  Yeah she knows  It's over 
[00:28:30]  Extreme low level  Celebrity  By the way  That's why  Companies panic  It's fucking  Broads like that  Yeah  That's why  Companies panic  About any wink  In the hallway  Any smile  It's chicks  Like I know  Cock photos are different  But still  I understand  You shouldn't be  Sending your cock  Photos to  You know  Fellow employees  But I really  Would love to know  I would really  Love to know  The whole story  Here that  We're never  Going to hear  By the way  Because Brett  Favre's not  Going to talk  But can you  Imagine an NFL 
[00:29:00]  Anti-harassment  Program  What these guys  Do on the field  Every Sunday  Yeah  And they gotta  Understand what  Harassment is  What harassment's  All about  These fucking  Teams hire  Animals  I know  They hire them  To be animals  There's a certain  Mindset it takes  To get out there  And beat the shit  Out of each other  Like that  Certain mindset  To take your body  Run full speed  Into another body  That's running full speed  Right at you  Yeah  And then you want  To sit them down  In front of a  Human resources person  And explain to them 
[00:29:30]  What harassment is  That doesn't work  It's different  People are different  In that way  And they fall  Into groups  And football players  And there are  Some exceptions  But football players  Primarily fall into  A group that  You really  They wouldn't  Take seriously  An anti-harassment  Seminar  Right  They wouldn't  Yeah  Brett Favre's  Alleged sexting  Target  With a short  Little helmet  Isn't that ironic  A football player  Has a little helmet  Old school  I hated his helmet 
[00:30:00]  It's terrible  His cock  Is a player  From like 1916  Oh god  Some Vietnamese chick  Should put a grenade  In it  And throw it in  A helicopter  I would imagine  That Brett Favre  Thought it was  Safe enough  To send the  Pictures to her  Of course  If that's what  He did  And he wasn't  Dialing randomly  Apparently he had  Her number  Right  So how'd that happen  He wasn't just  Willy nilly  Fucking saying  I think she would  Like my cock photo  Something else is  Going on here  That we don't know about 
[00:30:30]  And do you think  It was her  Saying you know  Hey Brett  I'd like to set up  An interview with you  Or some type of thing  Business wise  Thank you  Please get back to me  And he just hits  Respond with a cockpit  Or do you think  Maybe there was  Some chit chat  A little  You know  A little back and forth  Flirtatious action  I think someone like her  Uses her sexuality  To kind of  Move her career along  Of course  And I'm trying to be  Very like  It's nice to know  She looked at me  And said he can do  Nothing for me  The same thing I say 
[00:31:00]  Nothing  She wants  She wants guys  To think she's  Extremely hot  Of course she does  She wants that badly  So she uses that sexuality  To push her career along  And then Brett Favre  Feels that vibe  And is thinking  Oh fuck man  And whatever else  They were talking about  And said you know what  I'm sending her a cockpit  I'm going to photoshop  The tip of my dick off  And send it to her  I'm so annoyed  With his penis  I am too  It looks like an  Our gang baseball hat  Fucking stinks 
[00:31:30]  His dick  It should have a propeller  On top of it  His stupid beanie cock  He has a retard  Hat cock  I would imagine  This is my guess  That I wrote it down  Oh you think so  I'm guessing  That she's kind of  A cock tease  You think  I don't know for sure  But it's just my  My gut feeling  On this one  My gut feeling  I don't like Brett Favre  I've never liked him  But you gotta stick up  For the guy  In this situation  He really  It's too early  To get shit pictures  Who's sending 
[00:32:00]  His shit pictures  That fucking asshole  It's never too early  For log photos  It's because  He stopped by my house  Like very early  He's probably on his way  Either home or to work  You know  He works those odd hours  And he  I guess  Took a dump  At my house  And has to show me  The fucking  Load of dinting  More beef stew  He left in my  Fucking toilet  Nothing worse  Than a cop shit  It's just  It's got like  A lot of bad coffee  In it  A lot of stress 
[00:32:30]  A lot of nervous energy  Little clipped logs  Ah shit  God damn  Fucking bastard  That's funny  So she's now saying  If the NFL does something  Then she's not suing  But I  I don't think  She has a fucking case  But she wants to try  To keep the story  Moving along  She probably wants money  I would guess  She wants money  And maybe a little money  I think she lost  I think she lost  Her gig  That she was promoting  On our show  She looks like a comedian  I know  Named Eddie Ift 
[00:33:00]  If it's Eddie  Anyone knows  Eddie Ift  Out there  She looks like  Eddie Ift  Really  In the face  Look these broads  They want respect  In  These broads  Want respect  In sports  Yeah  In broadcasting  Right  And then you google  Her name  And what do you see  We're looking at  Broad pics  We're looking at  Some amazing pictures  Of this broad  One being where  She's holding up  A piece of clothing  Up to her boobs  Trying to keep them  From not being exposed 
[00:33:30]  She's going  Teehee  They're piling out  Ooh  Half the breast meat  Is spilling out  Breast meat  But then she wants  Respect in the business  You don't have  Google Marv Albert  I want to see all the  Fucking sexy shots  Of Marv Albert  Bad example  Len Berman  Len Berman  Maybe not picture  Well yeah  How about this picture  Of Marv  With his fucking  Arlington County  Police plaque  In front of him  Good point  I thought enough years  Went by  That we could go back  To Marv Albert  97  I was mistaken  But just imagine 
[00:34:00]  All the big  Broadcasters  They don't have  Sexy photos of  Themselves all over  The internet  You can't have it  Both ways  You can't be  Showing your  Tits and your ass  And then  Hope that you  Get respect  And then  Be puzzled  When someone  Sends you a  Cock picture  I want respect  Enough of this broad  It's exactly  What it is  Who's talking about  This broad  They want their  Sexuality to help  Them  They want their  Sexuality to be  So that way  You want them 
[00:34:30]  Around and hire  Them  You want to  Look at them  But when you  Fucking hit on  Them they  Fucking cry  Yeah  Yeah  Do you think  Viewers look at  Anybody on the  Field that's a  Guy and have to  Worry about what  He looks like  Or it's like  You know that  Man isn't  Attractive enough  To tell me about  Football  But every girl  On the sideline  You look at  Like oh  Well let me  Take a look at  That's horrible  Pam Oliver  Yeah  You know now  I gotta read the  So former Jet  Game Day  Hostess Jen  Sturger wants 
[00:35:00]  League boss  Roger Goodell  To do the  Right thing  And suspend  Favre  Said her  Manager  If the  Commissioner  Suspends  Favre  And puts a  League wide  Program in  Place to keep  This from  Happening again  Jen will not  Pursue litigation  Against the  NFL  She's not  Going to  Pursue litigation  Against the  NFL  Because she  Probably knows  She doesn't  Have a good  Case  Simple as  That  She would  Sue the  NFL  That's what  They would  Do  Favre  Or the  Jets  She won't  Sue the  NFL  Favre  Or the  Jets  I didn't  Read the  Whole  Well she's  Obviously so  Hurt by 
[00:35:30]  Those cock  Pictures  That she  Needs  Money  I would  Say that's  A fair  Thing  She should  Sue  Yeah  Because that  Somehow  Entitles her  To money  Money  Takes care  Of that  Yeah  It washes  That shit  Right out  Of your  Brain  Yeah  You don't  See it  Anymore  That  Cock  Pick  And her  Representative  There spoke  Amid growing  Speculation  That NFL  Brass may  Try to run  Out the  Clock  Declined  And take  Any action  On the  Matter  Before the  Season  Ends  And with  It  Favre's  Career  Because this  Is it  For Favre  He just  Wants to  Get to  The end  If I  Was  Favre  I'd  Sue  Her  Because I  Sent her 
[00:36:00]  The  Cock  Pick  And then  She  Seems  To have  Given it  To somebody  Else  Yeah  Wait a minute  That was  Just you  That was  Just meant  For you  What are  You doing  I gave it  To everybody  Else  And now  My cuck's  Out there  Yeah  It's kind  Of a hard  Sell  Yeah I  Know  I would  Try to  Counter sue  Yeah  On the  People's  Court  Doug  Llewellyn  Might agree  With you  Doug Llewellyn  And once  Again  Favre  He hasn't  Been there  For years  I think  No  Favre sent  Photos  Of his  Penis  And texted  Sturger  In a  Failed  Bid  To woo  Her  He was  Trying to 
[00:36:30]  Woo  Which is  Very different  Than harassing  A woman  Isn't it  It's a  Hard way  To woo  Yeah  Yeah but  That's how  Some people  Woo  Is that  A wooing  Because you  Feel like  Okay I'm  Wooing  And I  Think I  Could woo  With my  Cockpit  It depends  On how far  Into the  Woo you  Are  Of course  To send  A penis  Pick  If it's  The first  Day of  Wooing  No  If you've  Wooed  For a while  These high  School kids  Are sending  Fucking  Cockpicks  Left and  Right  Right  And the  Chicks  Are just  I follow 
[00:37:00]  Somebody on  Twitter  That just  Puts chicks  In front of  Their fucking  Mirrors  Or laying  On beds  Taking nude  Pictures of  Themselves  And obviously  It went to  Their boyfriend  The boyfriend  Put it out  On the net  Or something  It's an  Unlimited  Supply  And it's  Fantastic  Our Jen  Sturger  Interview  We have that  So we  Should replay  That  Because  Didn't she  Indicate  There's telltale  Signs  Well didn't  She indicate  That there  Was something  That was  Well that  Would mean  Someone  Would have  Went over  The interview  By now  I mean 
[00:37:30]  This story  Has only been  In the paper  Four months  Oh shit  Easily right  Three months  Oh boy  Iraq looks like  He's gonna cry  So I won't even  Fucking go there  I like how you  Can watch  Iraq TV  Over there  Yeah I love  Iraq TV  I want to see  Iraq TV  I never get to see it  He's got this  Serious look now  Like oh boy  I better look  Serious for the  Rest of the morning  How about you  Get in here early  Are you alright today  Are you sad  You look sad  No I'm not sad  Oh  Are you angry  That didn't sound  No I'm not angry 
[00:38:00]  What's your emotion  Right now  What's the top emotion  You're feeling right now  Second to top  Under hunger  Sorry I'm just kidding  I had to  What is it  What is it  Uh  I don't know  A feeling of letting people down  Yeah  Disgust  With yourself  What's up with the dry mouth  No time for a drink  When you're running around  Working  Did you oversleep today  I get up late  Are you disappointed  In yourself  Do you feel 
[00:38:30]  You could have done better  And since  You don't feel  You lived up to your potential  That you're feeling badly  About yourself  Of course  Oh  No that was not  A stop  I don't think that's  I don't think that's true  I don't either  Are you lying  Iraq  They don't believe you  I'm not lying  I think he's bummed  That he had to get here early  I go early in quotes  So you think all this  Emotion is because  He's upset that he had to be here  At 527  527 for a 6 o'clock start  What is the Iraq  Like  When work is all done 
[00:39:00]  Like what does an Iraq do  Are you asking me  Are you like a partier  Do you  Do you go out  Do you  Do you stay up late  Do you just watch TV  Do you drink out  Do you drink at home  Do you  What do you do  No I don't party  I don't drink  He stays up very late  But he plays video games  Is that what it is  No I don't do that either  You do  Don't drink  Don't smoke  Alright don't talk about  Then don't talk about  What you don't do  What do you do  What's an average  You're done with work  What's your evenings like  Um 
[00:39:30]  Usually it's sleeping  But uh  Iraq  Iraq  We are broadcasting  So can you make believe  You're peppy  I'm actually  I'm actually really tired today  But the first thing  You learn broadcasting  You gotta  I'm exhausted  You gotta pump it up  A little bit  So how about some energy  I slept three and a half hours  Yesterday  Oh really  Oh yeah  Really on Ron and Fez  So the monotone delivery  Is not doing anyone any good  Pump it up a little bit  And answer Anthony's question 
[00:40:00]  Alright  So you just sleep  Uh  Well  I get home  Um  I clean up around the apartment  I'll take a nap  Uh  Depending when I wake up  Uh  I watch  Um  The  I watch TV  Uh  This is action packed  Cook dinner  Oh okay  Well that's probably where  The majority of the time is spent  Yeah  Kidding  Eating little ingredients  As it goes  And there's nothing left  What happened  I gotta start again 
[00:40:30]  Oh that's just mean  Just a theory  Uh  Alright so it's not like  A big party night  Going on  No I don't usually go out  And what time do you usually  Cash in your chips  At the end of the night  Um  Hit the hay as they say  Depending uh  When I woke up  From my nap or whatever  Usually either between  Nine and eleven  Really  Yeah  And do you have trouble  Getting up  Uh  Sometimes  Could be apnea  Could be apnea 
[00:41:00]  Well I  I do have that  Do you  Yeah  I have meds for that  I just want to  Talk to Dr. Steve  I want to go for  I was looking at apnea masks  I want to go for um  That we  To get  To get one of those  To sleep with  The CPAP things  Yeah  Do you  I don't qualify for that though  Why  Because apparently  I'm just under the level  Of where you qualify  For that  You should have faked it  Hold your breath  During the test  Or something  Wait your apnea  Is just not bad enough  To need a mask  He gives me a real answer  It's just something  It's mind boggling  I love it 
[00:41:30]  I don't believe in the sleep mask  Oh it's supposed to help  I know guys that use it  I'd rather die in my sleep  How could you  It's what Reggie White said  Whatever  How could you sleep next to  Your chick  With a fucking  Darth Vader mask on  How could you not  I would love to do that  To my chick  She would destroy you  Who cares  As long as she takes  The load in her face  Nighty night  Load taker  With a nice oxygenated load  I wish my girlfriend  Would complain  I'll wear a tampon  On my face to bed  You like flying first class  Shut up 
[00:42:00]  It's just supposed  To change your life  My buddy Leo  Leo  Takes it  And he's a fucking  He's like a man's man  A man's  Man's guide  To a man being a man  One of those guys  And he said  It's changed his life  Everyone I know  Who's done stuff like that  Like the sinus surgery  Yeah but I want to know  About the sex life  Does the sex go up or down  When you  When you  When you strap on  The mask to go to bed  I bet it doesn't affect it  Because you probably  I always fuck before 
[00:42:30]  Like I'm never  Like laying in bed  Almost asleep  And I go let's fuck  It's always taking  You'd always put that on  Before you actually  I'd say let's sleep  Yeah  Like I used to wear  Breathe Right strips all the time  I wouldn't fuck with them on  I remember that  I tried those  Those don't help  I think he wears the mask  To sleep too  Yeah he should  The ugly mask  He wears it all the time  He wears it awake too  So why don't you  Just pay for it  Because you take  The sleep study  And they monitor you  Right  For a night while you sleep  I'm not at that level  Where I qualify  So if I went to get it  On my own 
[00:43:00]  Because the doctor  Won't  Insurance won't  Offer to me  Insurance won't cover it  And it's a few thousand dollars  Insurance is  I would go for another opinion  Because insurance companies  Oh you went twice  I went for two different studies  Because I want to go  And try one  Do they give you anything  Here's the thing  When you go for a sleep test  I know that they hook you up to wires  And I piss so much at night  What do you do to piss  Like  You have to ring this little  Buzzer thing  That's on the nightstand there  And they come in  They unhook you 
[00:43:30]  But you're still strapped  Into all this wire  There's like putty stuff  That's kind of glued to your skin  To hold everything in there  Putty  And this little machine  You got to carry with you  Into the bathroom  Oh so they don't have to  Unhook 50 things  No but they got to unhook  Not everything off of you  But they got to unhook  One main cable off the bed  How do you sleep  With all that stuff like  I would never be able  To fall asleep  Like a matrix  You know when you  You're at the dentist  And they put the lead vest  On you for the x-ray  And it feels kind of heavy  This is like 50 times that  You're kind of just 
[00:44:00]  Weighed down on your back  So you're really not  Going to roll over at all  Wow  I would never sleep like that  How do you sleep like that  It's scary  You just  You kind of  Like you have your head arched  And you're laying there  With all this equipment on you  And the wiring and everything  And then you just kind of  Have to turn your head  Either to the left  Or to the right  Is the mattress comfy  You can't sleep  On your back dude  No you have to sleep  On your back  I can't  I have to sleep on my side  Nope  Then what does that do  That doesn't help  How's that going to help me  I can lay like a corpse  For four hours 
[00:44:30]  And not breathe  They monitor you  Good for them  I can't sleep like that  Hi you're monitoring me  I'm still awake  I don't have acne  In my awakeness  You either choke  And you wake up  Or if you're really  Having problems  They come in  And they shake you  And kind of turn you  To your side  I would never sleep  Wow  That does sound like  A little  That sucks  Do they give you  A pill to knock you out  No  No why would they  You're not supposed to  Eat or drink  Before the survey  They don't give you 
[00:45:00]  Any medication  Oh actually  Unless there's  A specific medication  That you have to have  You know  Yeah because they don't  Want you taking  A sleeping pill  Because that  Is not how you sleep  Every day  No cold medicine  Aspirin  Any of that stuff  I'll just buy  The fucking machine  Yeah buy the fucking machine  Just buy the machine  Why not  I think it would be  Kind of cool  To just sleep  Huffing oxygen  Or something all night  That would rock  That would rock  I guess you're right  Probably feel kind of  Kind of good  Who am I to say  My father sleeps  I guess you're right  And my mom said  That they fuck all the time 
[00:45:30]  Really  She told me that  Nice  She's with the mask on  Because she pretends  These other people  Nice  She pretends  She's sleeping with a guy  In World War II  Who's flying a fucking plane  My dad was old school  I guess if he was alive today  He would be diagnosed  With extreme sleep apnea  Really  Oh yeah  We would listen in our rooms  The snoring was  I don't think anyone  Snored loud  I just don't  Yeah  The famous  The walls  You felt like they were  Yeah  Shaking  And in the middle of the night  You would hear him  Stop breathing  For 20-30 seconds 
[00:46:00]  Was it that like  Oh yeah  Yeah  That whole thing  Like the beginning of the snore  And then you're waiting  For the wave to come back  You know what I mean  And it would take  30 seconds sometimes  And then finally  Damn  And I'm sure  That was sleep apnea  But I don't think  They had sleep apnea  When we were growing up  I think that's one of the newer things  They called it snoring  They just called it heavy snoring  Right  Yes Mr. Rock  Well I have the snoring  With the choking at times too  But there's times 
[00:46:30]  If you're laying on your stomach  E-Rock  How about you do something  For the show for once  And tape yourself  Snoring like a loaded tent  That would be good  Well okay  There's other times too  Where I'm laying on my stomach  Keep talking about what you want  This relates to it  I said I'll tape it  Angela will lean over  And punch me  Because I'll just stop breathing  That's what she tells you  The reason is  You can feel the rhythm  Of your breathing on the bed  And it just stops  No noise or anything  And she's got to kind of  She doesn't have her fingers crossed  Going come on  She actually punches you  And goes stop breathing  She punches you 
[00:47:00]  Because you stopped breathing  Yeah it doesn't happen  That often  And you haven't seen a doctor  About this  I have  And there's nothing  They can do  Other than the pills  That they give me  What do they give you  I think it's called  It's a generic  It's a  I think it's called  Miroplex or something  The problem I'm having  Is I'm not getting past  There's three stages of sleep  And I'm not getting past  Stage two  So it's like technically  I'm still awake  While I sleep  You know dude  That's probably exactly  What's going on 
[00:47:30]  And my body  I wish that stage four  Dead  Great  Oh god  No that's  How would that be stage four  People come back  From stage four  Do you know  The  Probably not  No  Is that the bad one  I would think  Should have won stage three  Stage three  Yeah probably  The pills  Supposed to cut off  The signal from  And you can go with this  From your brain  To the rest of your body  He knows  Because your body  Doesn't stop  When you try to go to sleep  Wait what are they called 
[00:48:00]  I think  I think my generics  Are called Miroplex  I'll double check  The name on it  They cut off the signal  From your brain  To your body  Your brain doesn't  If you don't hit stage three  Your brain still thinks  You're awake  So your body  Still tries to function  There's times  Where I'll wake up  In the middle of the night  And I feel like I'm on fire  Because I wasn't really  Fully breathing  And like your whole body  You're just so full of energy  And you're shaking  You can't calm down  And it takes like 20 minutes  Before it all goes away  Are you having panic attacks  In your sleep  You're probably just remembering  Some molestation  When you were a young E-Rock  And some radio guy somewhere 
[00:48:30]  When you went in  He wanted to show you  The control board  And he sat you on his lap  And raped you  You're probably reliving  Some molestation  Can I ask what Troy's problem is  Because he obviously  He doesn't like E-Rock  He writes  Imagine how tired he'd be  If he actually worked out  That's true  Oh god  Poor E-Rock  Your boy is beating  The shit out of you  Right behind you  He's opening up today  But if there were  A little more exercise  A little less TV watching  Maybe you'd be tired  That might be true  When I'm working out  And I've been very lax lately  But when I'm working out  In the day 
[00:49:00]  It does help me get tired  At night  Oh hell yeah  It really does  It changes you  But don't do it  Right before you go to bed  Because it'll give you energy  So wait  Mirror Plex  What the fuck  Does Mirror Plex do  Because I wonder  If I should take it  They put out  They produce like  Pulp Fiction  And Reservoir  What?  Yeah  It's like a plex  Of mirrors or something  Like a centiplex  Or something  Yeah exactly  I just have a hard time  Thinking that people  Are  Have these problems sleeping  Because you wake up  You go to your job  You try to eat healthy 
[00:49:30]  And you exercise  And you just fall asleep  You're just exhausted  From the day  Yeah but you're like  In shape guy  Yeah but you can  Anybody can be that guy  No I'm serious  Like what happens  Because Dr. Steve  Has been explaining it  Like you get  You get so heavy  That you're actually  Collapsing your airways  So you start out  A little  A little at a time  You see  E-Roc's like  Pelican fucking  Oh yeah  That's what does it  Because that weight  Just goes down  That weight goes down  On your  On your  On your epiglottis  Yeah  But you can get rid of that  So now you're not  Getting enough oxygen  Yeah  So now 
[00:50:00]  Now you're not  Sleeping properly  Which gives you  This lump of shit  That we're looking at  Oh my god  That's harsh  You can be very skinny  And still have apnea though  It's  No but in most cases  I mean they say  If you lose the weight  You're absolutely right  You can cure yourself  But you either  Head down the path  Where you just keep  Getting heavier  And more out of shape  Or you bounce back  So to speak  What did you say  About E-Roc at his wedding  Well I mean  You know  Like I said  And look  I love Eric  But you know  You're getting married dude  Like get on a fucking treadmill 
[00:50:30]  You know  Go take a couple laps  Around the block  Isn't that cool  Yeah married  Like after you're married  Yeah then you go to shit  It's going to shit  Yeah  So the best you'll ever look  Should be right before  You get married  And don't you want to have  Your kids look at the photos  And be like  Oh look how good looking  My parents were  Oh look at that  Yeah  You know  Have her family be like  Wow what a handsome man  And handsome guy  Way to bring this up  After the fact  Knowing he can't do anything about it  Yeah but I've been talking about this  And those photos are frozen in time already 
[00:51:00]  Oh forever  Right  Maybe you can photoshop your wedding  Yeah  I don't know  I just  You know it's just like  Come on man  Make a little effort  That's all  So you're disappointed in your pal E-Roc  I just wish  Because you guys are pretty close  Take a little better care of himself  You know what I mean  Because it's one of those things  Where he's at that age  Where he's either going to go downhill  Or he's going to have to develop  Some healthy habits  That'll help him for the rest of his life  This is the third time  He's yelled at E-Roc this week  Really?  What was the other time?  He got into a big thing with E-Roc on Monday 
[00:51:30]  And then yesterday  They got into a little thing  Because he brought  He accused E-Roc of being lazy  What was the big thing  This is tough love  What was the big thing on Monday?  Well  Which one was Monday?  Monday was when you really started going off on him  And E-Roc said  Well I'm never going to give you anything again  And you said good  Don't ever give me anything  Well because  Fridays are just brutal for me  I'm here until  Five, six o'clock at night  And  You know  The work just piles up  And Eric will set everything on my desk  When I'm not there  And then he'll walk out 
[00:52:00]  So I'm the one that has to do it  Because if he finds me there  Then I'll say to him  Dude can't you help me out  With loading the shit?  You know  And then he'll feel guilty  And then have to do it  Or he'll buy me lunch earlier  If that's kind of the padding  To help me  You know  Yeah  Yeah E-Roc buys a lot of lunches  I know that  Well  Does he get them from other people?  Whoppers are two for four dollars  Are you eating Whoppers?  No  I would love to have a Whopper  I would fucking love  I would eat a Whopper right now  Let me tell you what I would love to have  A fucking Whopper 
[00:52:30]  And those goddamn wonderful fries  And an apple pie  And just fucking sit there  Eating that shit  Would that be great?  Absolutely  Yeah  God  That  My fucking  My business manager  Uh  Business  Sent me yesterday  I got a tin  Of chocolates  Like little hersch  Like little pieces  Like a  Little teeny crackles  Nice  Little bite sized crackles  And um  I ate a few of them  And I made my girlfriend 
[00:53:00]  Take them home  I'm like leave them in your fridge  Cause I can't  I'll eat them all  Like you have to sometimes know  I'm weak  I'm a fucking weak  So I know  We're all weak  That I can't  No not necessarily  Oh fuck yeah man  Some guys  Florentine's a guy  I can't control that shit either  Florentine can have two of something  And stop  He's amazing  If you go to my house  There's no junk food  Because I know I can't control myself  So we buy it very sparingly  Yeah  I got it there  And then as soon as it's in the house  I'll eat the whole fucking thing  I know  Same way  I can't  I can't  I can't not eat it 
[00:53:30]  See you try to get low fat  Like fat free  So I try to just completely  Keep it out of my house  It's hard  I got that shit all over my house  I got crap food  All over my house  Because  And you could  And the kids and stuff  And you could control yourself  I do not look at  I fucking  Open up the cabinet  And I'm like  There's no way I'm eating that  No fucking way  How do you say that?  I envy that  I don't fucking eat it  I just don't  I'll take a fucking  An oven stuffer roaster  And wait two hours for it to cook  And eat that  Just  So I don't have to eat 
[00:54:00]  Canned  Fucking salt  And fat  Why can't you do that with booze?  That's what I can't do  It is amazing  We all have our vices  But when I see that beer tap  I'm running for it  We all have our cost to carry  I vault for that beer tap  If your beer tap was a chocolate tap  I'm in trouble  Yeah  Fudge comes out of it  It's like  Oh yeah  This is wonderful  I'm a dark chocolate asshole  I hate dark chocolate  I love dark chocolate  I had a bite yesterday  I'm like  This is garbage  And I spit it at her 
[00:54:30]  But the percentage  The percentage can't be too high though  Oh where it's bitter chocolate  Like cooking chocolate  I forgot what the percentage has to be  I do like a good fucking  Like a Hershey bar  60's about right  60, 70 is good  Anything above that  It starts tasting way too fucking bitter  That's what I'll usually  Like that's the one vice I'll do also  Every so often  I'll just grab a Hershey bar  And just fucking  Oh my god  And eat what I like the fuck now  They're just unbelievable  We're all weak  I think the point is  To not have that stuff around  I'm weak  I'm weak 
[00:55:00]  But I know  I can't have that shit  I tell my girlfriend  Stop bringing that fucking shit  I'm like  Just eat it when you're not with me  You're young  I can't do it  I'm fucking  I'm weak  And she's just  Eating and remaining rail thin  She doesn't give a fuck  She doesn't care  She eats cake on the toilet  She doesn't give a shit  Me  I literally  I eat something  And then I come in here the next day  And I feel it  I am in such a fucking  Self-loathing  With my body  Fucking mode right now 
[00:55:30]  Like I go through these  Yeah  On a lazy weekend  Fuck me  If we order pizza or something  And I'll have like  One or two slices of pizza  I'm just freaking out  Like what the fuck  Why did you do that  Who can eat  Only two slices of pizza  That's my other thing  I force myself  And then if I drink too much wine  And throw up  I feel good  Like I'm like  Yeah I puked up the fucking wine  And the pizza  You puke a lot  Do you understand  How many problems you have  You're a fucking bulimic  Do you puke once a month 
[00:56:00]  Let me think  Honestly  Let me think  No it's not once a month  It might be two times in a month  And then I might go six months  Without woofing  Wine is the enemy  Wine  To  Like a wine buzz  A wine drunk  Will fuck me up to no end  Wine hangovers are the worst  The hangovers are bad  They last 24 hours for me  I will  I could throw up  20 hours after a wine hangover  I could be like  I could be like  Oh fuck  I still don't feel good  Oh fuck 
[00:56:30]  Beer  I'm impervious to a beer hangover  Captain and Coke  A little sweet  I'm good if I have a few  If it's an all nighter  Or during the summer  You start like in the afternoon  By the pool  And it lasts all night  Then you feel like dog shit  The next day  You know it's hard  When you go out to dinner  And then like  She'll want a dessert  I feel like  My weakness  Shouldn't affect her  Enjoying her meal either  Like it's like  I can't be that fucking selfish  Yeah stop eating that  In front of me  Yeah I mean  It's like I gotta be a man  And fucking just take responsibility 
[00:57:00]  And not have any  But especially if you're at Morton's  And there's big desserts  Oh  Oh they wheel those things  The fucking Morton's  Has a carrot cake  I literally would just  Not eat for three days  So I could have the carrot cake  It's fucking  Amazingly delicious  And girls with desserts  They'll order the  The chocolate lava cake  Whatever  Let's just go with that one right  Yeah that's good shit  And then I get mad  Like why'd you order that  She goes whoa  I'm like  I can't control myself  And then she'll have one bite  Cause she can control herself  Yes  And then who's eating  The whole fucking thing  Exactly  And I wasn't gonna order it 
[00:57:30]  Yeah  I was gonna say no to dessert  When we go around the table  When we go out to eat  With a bunch of people  I pray  It starts at 12 o'clock  It goes around the table  It's like no dessert for me  No dessert for me  I'm like no dessert for me  Yeah you can opt out  I never order dessert  No one gets it  And then there's always  One fucking person  That orders the dessert  And has one or two bites  And then I'm looking  At this fucking thing  I'm like well someone's  Gotta eat it  And I'm the guy  Always  And then fucking  Like a fatso  And this is a little  Fucking trick I use  Where sometimes I'll go  Like I know I wanted dessert 
[00:58:00]  But I'm just lying to myself  And I'll go  With the way we done  I'm like  So do you want dessert  And she'll be like  I don't know  And she's like do you  I'll be like well no  But if you want some  I'll have a bite  What I'm saying is  Please order dessert  Fat tits need dessert  I'm begging her  To give me an excuse  To eat dessert  And then the girls  Can just nibble a little bit  A little taste  That's all they need  She does that  Where she'll  She'll fucking finish it  And there's one bite  She'll eat it out of one bite  And go alright I'm done  And I'm like stop acting 
[00:58:30]  Like you have willpower  There's fucking one bite left  You just want to say  That you didn't finish your dessert  Yes  Don't bring me in on your lie  Cause I'll finish it  And then you'll finish it  Oh fucking  Too good  I'm the worst  I like a little espresso  With some sambuca  After the meal  That's nice  Oh that's nice  Marron  Anyway my mother used to do  She'd make the sausage  And the sambuca  First you start with  A little underbust  And then you got  Your rigatoni  Shut up

[00:59:30]  Yeah that's  I want to ask her about the Pez dispenser  I want to ask her about  Well that's a prior princess Leia Pez dispenser  Yeah  I want to ask her about George Lucas  There's no love lost there  You can tell yeah  Seems like she's not a big fan of the George Lucas  Even though George Lucas made her a big star  But she comes from the type of family  That doesn't matter as much  As it does for other people  Sure  Right  Because her parents  Yeah  What else do you want to ask her about  I wrote all sorts of shit  Yeah I should have wrote some stuff down  Because I really  Oh I know what I want to say to her 
[01:00:00]  Is there going to be a reunion movie with you  And Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford  As the characters in Star Wars  Are you going to do that?  Are you going to do that?

[01:00:30]  That George Lucas  Basically fucked her  Because she has a wide face  To begin with  And then they gave her  That dumb hairdo  For Star Wars  The dumb hairdo  That made her face look even wider  I mean she's really open  I don't know if that  I'll be honest  I don't know if it's for everybody  But it's going to be on HBO this weekend  It was a one person show  It's a one person show  That HBO filmed  And filled in with some clips  Of her mom or dad  Herself  Some Star Wars stuff  She hung out with a fast crowd  Well we all liked it  I mean  I liked it  I thought it was really interesting  I would have never watched it  If it wasn't for the show  But now I'm glad I did  Me too

[01:03:30]  That is a good one  One second  He's  He's not  Oh you got it  And now  This  Is the Opie and  Anthony show  On the virus  Sirius XM  I want to acknowledge 
[01:04:00]  That my old  Hockey team  Officially I'm not a fan  Lost their  18th out of  19  19 games  Congrats  The New York  Islanders have  Lost 18 out of  19 games now  Bruins beat them  Last night  Bruins got a  Pretty good team  They even rested  Their all-star  Goalie  They just rested  And they're like  Didn't need them  And then I hear 
[01:04:30]  Like the Islanders  Are so bad that  They couldn't even  Sell seats in  Boston because  They were coming  To town  That's how bad  They're getting  Yeah  Yeah but they  Rested the star  Goalie like  Take the night  Off we got  This one easy  Don't worry about it  Just open  Just open net  Yeah  Put another man  On the ice  It's ridiculous  So it's just a  Disaster of epic  Proportions  And I made a  Couple videos of  Throwing my tickets  Away and people  Are like oh fake  So fake  Whatever  But now  News 12 on  Long Island 
[01:05:00]  Did a little piece  On that  Damn it  See now I have  Fios and I can't  Get News 12  And I knew this  Would happen  Finally  Something that  I want to see  And I couldn't  Get it because  I don't have  News 12  They were right  I should have  Stuck with cable  Vision  Shit out of luck  My friend  The funny thing  Is  The thousand other  Features I get  With Fios  I would throw  Them all away  For News 12  I got a little  Excited  I'm like wow  A little exposure  For my video  Right  You would think  I would get 
[01:05:30]  Just a shitload  Of feedback  I think two  People saw it  No one watches  News 12 on Long  Island I'm assuming  And finally  The Islanders  Are not the hottest  Team in town  And neither  Are their tickets  So this man  Figured if he  Can't give them  Away  Throw them away  This is  Centerport native  And shock jock  Opie  Of the Opie  And Anthony  Radio show  Throwing away  $600 worth  Of tickets  On the LIE  And then he  Took four tickets  To this Saturday's  Game  To the Hudson River  A lot of people 
[01:06:00]  Think these tickets  Are fake  As you can see  They're not fake  These are my tickets  And I'd rather  Do this  Than go to another  Game at the  Nassau Coliseum  And see this  So tickets are  Available for this  Saturday's game  Just bring a bathing  Suit  And I'm sure  Somewhere along the  LIE  There might be  People out there  Right now  Looking at  Flashlights  And I will say  This  You can throw them  Away but  People might want  To go  There certainly 
[01:06:30]  Might be people  Who want to go  Just give them  Away  But hey  Listen  Make a statement  You got a little  Reprimand there  Give away  I sure did  Bring a bathing  Suit  And the whole  Went like  Oh give him a  Chance  I sure did  Yeah a lot of  People really  Upset that I'm  Not just giving  Them to like  A kid or  Something  Fuck  I wouldn't do  That to a  Kid  I wouldn't  Send them to  A shitty  Fucking arena  To see a  Shitty team  How is that  Helping out a  Kid  Poor little  Bastard sitting  There crying  Because his 
[01:07:00]  Team's losing  Fuck that  And then they  Showed the video  On versus  Last night  So it's  Getting a little  Exposure  Oh they did  Yeah  Versus  Versus is like  The hockey channel  They show a lot  Of the hockey games  People know  They stink  Yeah  18 out of 19  Games they have  Lost  That is just  Unbelievable  I think they only  Have five wins  For the entire  Year  Isn't that hard  To do  Harder to do  Than win  I think that's  Almost impossible  To do  Yeah  It's like when  You get the  Keno numbers  That you're playing 
[01:07:30]  And it works out  Where you play  So many numbers  That if you get  No numbers  You win money  Oh really  Yeah yeah  It gets to the  Point where  You pick so many  Numbers  That the odds  Are you're gonna  Hit at least  A few of them  So if you hit  None  You win money  Oh I didn't  Know that  Yeah  Is that a good  Payoff  I have no idea  I haven't played  That game in a  Long time  Keno used to be  The bar game  Right  What was the one  In Boston we used  To play  They had a version  Of that  Yeah that was  They give it  All kinds of  Different names  Yeah that was  A great way to  Just kill a few  Hours  Have a few beers  And just  Oh yeah 
[01:08:00]  Play that  How is that legal  I know  You're just  Betting on numbers  Come on  Or you're just  Sitting in a bar  I was reading  More on the  OTB thing  Yeah  I hope we didn't  Downplay that yesterday  The OTB  Off track betting  For the New York  Area is closing  Because they didn't  Make a profit  Yeah  And I don't know  Why this isn't  On the news  Every single day  Because it says  A lot about  What is going on  There with  Yep  With the  Politicians  And with the  Corruption  And with the 
[01:08:30]  Red tape  And with the  Whatever  Yeah this is  Something you can  Actually look at  And identify with  No bullshit  Politician can come out  And explain  What's happening  Like the NTA  And other  Political things  They always  Smooth it over  This is a  Pretty much  A legal bookie  That will take  Your bet  For horse racing  At multiple tracks  All over the country  And  You win  They pay you off 
[01:09:00]  You lose  You lose  And they keep  Your money  And they were  Supposed to be  A big money maker  For the state  Right  Yeah  And they couldn't  Even do that  Without losing money  How does a bookie  Not turn a profit  When it's the only  Legal way  To bet on horse racing  What do you think  Was the problem  Too many levels  Of management  Too many levels  Of management  Just more waste  The OTB offices  Themselves are a bunch  Of shitholes  So they're not  Spending a lot  Of money on that  It's like basically  The bare minimum 
[01:09:30]  Right  The only bookie  The operation  That went broke  That is unbelievable  And no one's  Talking about this  Yeah  But it's a prime  Example of  How the state  Just cannot make  Anything work  Financially  They suck at it  MTA has the same  Problem  They can't figure out  How to keep that  Running and making  Some kind of profit  Yep  They can't figure it out  Why can't you  Figure that out  It's the easiest  Job ever  You're just collecting  Money all day  They're not improving 
[01:10:00]  Service or the  Trains and buses  That much  Yeah service is  Going down the shitter  It's even worse  Than it was before  They raised the rates  So it's just  We need to really  Revent  And this is just  On a local level  New York state  But the federal level  Is the same thing  And people say  Well where are we  Going to get the money  If we don't do this  That that  Where are we  Getting the money  Cut back on this  The bullshit  We talked about  Where we could find  I think it was  27 million dollars  Yesterday  That's what it's  Going to cost  To change the signs 
[01:10:30]  From uppercase  To lowercase  To a different font  Yes  Lowercase  They want lowercase  Street signs here  In New York  Even though  And they want to  Change 250,000  Signs  And I know we did  This break yesterday  But it's so worth  Repeating  The waste that goes on  No one has ever  Complained in my  Entire life  That they can't  Read street signs  I missed that term  Because it was  Uppercase  They did a study  I don't even know  What they did  And I'm sure  The study cost a lot  And they decided  That the signs 
[01:11:00]  Need to be in  Lowercase  And no one is  Outraged and  Yelling and screaming  About this  First letter capitalized  And then the rest  Of it lowercase  They're closing firehouses  Yeah  Yeah maybe  But they're saving  Some of the money  So they can change  The signs from  Uppercase to lowercase  It's lunacy  It doesn't make any sense  And I don't know  Who presents these things  And that's one example  By the way  Without getting thrown  Out of office  Well two examples today  Because I mean  We paid for the OTB mess  Obviously  Our tax dollars  Are paid for that  And our tax dollars 
[01:11:30]  Are paying for the  Lowercase crap  Yeah  That's only two examples  I'm sure there's  A million other ones  And then they're  Taking police officers  Off the street  They're closing firehouses  Our schools are shitty  That's how they cut back  Instead of maybe  You know  Cutting back on their own pay  Or just making  Government smaller  We don't need  As many government officials  We really don't  No I don't  There's way too many  That are justifying  Their jobs  And it's just a mess  I agree  Let me say hi to Alan 
[01:12:00]  In North Carolina  Hello  Hi boys  Hey man  How you calling  Y'all shock jocks  Oh it's awful  It's so uncomfortable  When we hear that  There's nothing  You guys ain't  Done nothing shocking  In years  No  Oh well thanks  No you're right though  You're honestly right  The term means nothing now  Because you can't really  Shock people anymore  Two clicks on the internet  I'll show you shocking shit  Believe me  So I don't think  Theater of the mind 
[01:12:30]  With someone sitting there  In their car  Imagining the shocking stuff  We're talking about  Right  Is really  Overshadowing  Some of the shit  I've seen on the internet  We  Yeah  The media just has to  Label everything  Yep  They have to put a label  On everything  How about radio hosts  Get with the times  Shock jocks  We talk about a lot of  You know  Heavy shit on this show  And of course  Then we talk about shit  You did this right  Right  I mean Jimmy  Bunked heads on that  No he didn't  You were doing a joke  And I was like  Forgive me 
[01:13:00]  I was setting up  For a fucking  Butt speech  But the show  Is way more  Than just  Shock jock shit  Yeah  It's been way more  Ever since we started  We haven't been  Shock jocks  Since we pretty much  Got thrown off the air  For being shock jocks  Yeah but even then  We were doing  Some heavy duty stuff  In between that stuff  But the thing is  Like we  I would absolutely  Have no problem  With them  Saying shock jock  Opie and Anthony  Back then  Right  Because you know

[01:16:30]  State  Politicians  These fucking idiots  They can't run a bookie joint  How the fuck are they going to run anything else  If you can't make money on a bookie joint  How the fuck do you run a railroad  And a city  When you can't run a bookie joint  Yeah  Let's go to Paul in New York  Paul  Hey there Paul  What do you say Mike  Hey Paul  We paint each other up  Hey I actually  I do work for OTB as well  No you don't dude  Of course  What would you do that 
[01:17:00]  No the fire department  I saw it on the news this morning  New York fire department  They started to charge  Attacks  It's going to be  In fact maybe in July  If it passes some shit  If you get in an accident  And they have to respond  Oh right  And it's going to be tiered  Based on type of accident  Injury  Non-injury  That kind of thing  Damage  Fire  Non-fire  Wait  Yeah I heard about this  You're going to have to pay some money  If you have an accident  And the fire department  And police  And just a public service  Just in New York  Show up  Yeah in New York 
[01:17:30]  How desperate is this fucking state  In this city  It's going to cost you  They're just trying to find money  Wherever they can now  What are your taxes for  Yeah exactly  What are your taxes for  Why am I paying taxes  That's just it  That's what people are saying  Not only taxes  God forbid you get in a horrible accident  Now you've got to pay for it  On top of the horror  That it is to begin with  What about insurance  They said it was like  Six hundred and three hundred  Who the fuck agreed to this  Did we agree to this  The public  We had to have  The people represent our wishes  They work for us  So them representing us 
[01:18:00]  We must have said  Could you please make us have to pay  When we have an accident please  Where's that story  Can you do that  Why would we say that  That's a new one  I heard it on the news this morning  But yeah it's a tiered thing  Like if you have an accident  With no injuries  Then it costs a certain amount  If you have an accident with injuries  It's another amount  If you have an accident with fire  And no injuries  Fire  End injuries  Fatalities  And it's all based on  What asshole came up with this  I don't know  But they're trying to get it passed  They said what will happen is 
[01:18:30]  These costs  Are going to be absorbed  Into your insurance policies  Of course  So now you're going to buy your insurance  And there's going to be  Another little thing on there  That says  You know  The insurance company is going to pay  If you get into  Such and such an accident  So  They're not going to do that for free  So your premiums go up  Jesus  So what's going to happen is  You're going to pay higher premiums  And they're going to pay off  The public officials  That you pay anyway  Through your taxes  I need to find a mountain  Really 
[01:19:00]  I know  I'm going to find  What is coming in  I'm out  I need a mountain  Unibomber's cabin is up for sale  I need a mountain  And an ATV  That's all I need  Do you want to write a manifesto  That's all I need  Because you've got the cell phone now  Right  I'll get some kind of cell service  You just get a fucking sat phone  A little sat phone  A satellite phone  You don't even need a signal  It's great  Alright boys  You guys have a good day  That is unbelievable  It's unbelievable too man  Yeah  I didn't know that was going on  Yeah that's something new  They're trying to come up with  That's a desperation right there  Instead of looking at what's going on right now  And finding the money in other ways 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  For example  OTB being fucking run shitty  Yeah  And the street sign thing  Which I know is a Fed thing  That's a federal thing  Again the federal government stepped in  And said that  They have to replace all the signs  With this lower case signs  But it's going to wind up  Costing taxpayers money  Well this guy  Jim in Chicago  Is this already happening in Chicago  Jim  Shit like this  Good morning boys  Shit like this  I got pulled over  In this little shit  I hit town of Warsaw  In the end 
[01:20:00]  I got a speeding ticket  So I finally just said fuck  And I went in to go pay it  And I asked for a receipt  When I looked at the receipt  There were four separate court costs  I got charged a DNA processing fee  And I didn't come on anything  There was a DNA  What's a DNA processing fee  It was $2  I said what the fuck is this  He said sorry sir  It's included in the ticket  The actual speeding ticket was $49  When it was all said and done 
[01:20:30]  It was $189  Holy shit  It's amazing  You get surcharges  Out the asshole  A DNA processing fee  I'm a speeding ticket  But who agreed to this  We did  But how do we agree to this  Oh but you were sleeping  Something happened  You must have blurted it out  To your public official  Because  And your representatives  Because they represent you  Nothing drives me more nuts  Than the surcharge  It is everywhere now man  Yes sir 
[01:21:00]  Let's remind the cabbies  And the cab companies  That they added a  What was it  A gas surcharge  A gas surcharge  Where the price of gas  Was really really high  Completely out of control  Guess what  The gas prices  Have come down to earth  And the surcharge  Is still right there  When you're in the cabs  Because as soon as they  Add one of these surcharges  Ann taught me this years ago  They don't take it back  They don't  Why would they take it back  It never goes away  Why would they do that  It just doesn't go away  So my message to everybody  Is  Syntax and surcharge 
[01:21:30]  Yep  Yeah watch out  Yeah if you get pulled over  For speeding  Just whip it out  And ask them to DNA test you  Yeah you might as well  Come on something  If you're going to pay for it  Come in the cop's hand  He puts his hand out  Like he's feeding a horse  And you're just  Coming to it  They're paying for it  You come on it  My favorite one is  When you miss a toll  It's happened to me  A few times  Not so much  With the easy pass  You miss a toll  For whatever reason  And it was 75 cents  Yeah 
[01:22:00]  Get a bill in the mail  You missed this toll  For 75 cents  Like you were trying  To get away with something  Right  You were trying to get away  With not paying 75 cents  Knowing what they could do to you  Yeah  And then the surcharge  Is like a $50 surcharge  To process  The fact that  Processing  That you missed the fucking toll  So now  Your stupid 75 cents  That you missed  Throwing in the basket  Now is costing you  Over 50 bucks  And where is that money going really  And who approved that  Where they could just charge  A processing fee  That's whatever  Yeah  Whatever it would be  I think it's like $50  You think it really costs them 
[01:22:30]  That much money  For some douche  To just key in the fucking  Shit in their computer  Right  Some fucking  It's low level  Piece of dirt  They call it  An administration fee  Yeah  Yeah  That's like the shipping  And just pay separate  Shipping and processing  When they have the  Because that's the new thing  On these commercials  For merchandise  On TV  Yeah people know  The scam by now  I hope they do  Because I saw the latest one  Is the worst one ever  For separate shipping  And processing  For the people  Shopping at home 
[01:23:00]  Online I should say  Listen to what Ant's about  To say closely  If you don't know  What's going on  This is unbelievable  It's amazing  They're pretty much  Giving away the merchandise  Because it costs nothing  To make and produce  This crap that they're selling  I just saw one  For these $2 bills  They're special  American National Parks  $2 bills  It's a $2 bill  And it says  Independently  They put this artwork on it  Through another company 
[01:23:30]  So you get a $2 bill  And some printing press  They run it through  Puts a little thing  Of Yellowstone National Park  Or the Grand Canyon on it  Sure  And you get this  Yellowstone National Park thing  For $10  For a $2 bill  You're paying $10 for it  And then they say  And if you act now  You'll get the Grand Canyon  $2 bill  For free  Just pay separate  Shipping and handling  For a $2 bill  How much shipping  And handling difference  Is there 
[01:24:00]  To ship one $2 bill  As opposed to two $2 bills  It's not like you're  Shipping two washing machines  What is the shipping charge?  The shipping is usually  Anywhere between $7.99  And $15.99  Or $14.99  Fucking  For shit that like  If  I looked at a few things  And said  Okay  They're presenting this  As if you're paying  Let's say $7.99  $8 to buy something  Right  When all's said and done  And you get the free one  You're paying over $30  Jesus Christ 
[01:24:30]  When they finally ship  These fucking things  Pieces of shit to you  And the shipping fee  It's not a shipping fee  And handling  And then it says on the bottom  Shipping may take  Four to six weeks  It's like  Well if you're paying  That much for shipping  That fucking guy  Better be at your door  Tomorrow  Dropping off your crap  Don't they call it  Something else now  Shipping and  Processing and handling  It's not even shipping  It's processing  So it's something  That's going on  At the factory  That you know nothing about  It's unbelievable  Mr. Rock  They still run the commercial 
[01:25:00]  Where that old guy  Says I'll give you my disc  For free to show you  How to use your computer  Yeah  Or Word or Excel  All these other programs  At the beginning  It makes you think  That you're getting  All of these  But at the end  You have to specify  Which ones that you want  And they charge you  Per disc  That's one of the  That's one of the  Biggest scams ever  Because that one  Has been on  The Better Business Bureau  Websites  Message boards  Sure  That guy that goes  So buy my product  And he gives you the disc  You know how to learn  Fucking Photoshop  How to learn Windows  How to learn 
[01:25:30]  Fucking  Website building  And it's like  You have free disc  No obligation  And they send you  This one disc  And a lot of times  You need two discs  To do the whole thing  So you can't even  Use the one disc  And then they keep  Sending you discs  Every month  Like Columbia House  Yeah  Yeah  And in order to  Cancel it  It's nearly impossible  They phrase it  In the commercial  Just pay a small  Processing fee  Yeah  Small processing fee  Really for discs  How much is it  It's a scam 
[01:26:00]  I don't know  I don't know what it is either  But I've read more  Bad shit about that  Than anything else  I usually do  Because I got a computer  In front of me constantly  So if I see something  On television  That I think it's like  Wow that really looks shady  I pop it in  To search engine  And check it out  And you just read people  Bitching and complaining  About how awful it was  To try to get them  To stop sending them shit  How they never got  Their money back  If you order stuff off TV  You're crazy  Crazy  Crazy  I guess they get a lot of  Saps doing that  During Christmas time  People that don't go out at all 
[01:26:30]  They see something real quick  Yep  I'm ready to order  A CPAP machine  Get a CPAP machine  Fucking expensive  Cockstuckers  I want a CPAP smear machine  Let me go  See it would be fun  Let me go  Vaginas  Let me go to Jay  Jay's got a story  About a fire  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey what's up guys  Dude  They  Fucking  Just outside of like  Pennsylvania  Some a couple weeks ago  There was this story  And  Dude  They have to pay  For the fire department  It's like an extra  100 bucks a year  Or something  You gotta pay  And all these people 
[01:27:00]  Are like  Fuck that  I'm not paying it  So  The fire department  Comes out  They didn't pay  They just let the house  Burn down  It was on the news  And everything  They let it burn down  Can we find  If that was on the news  And everything  That they actually  Let a house burn down  Because they didn't  Pay their fee  Absolutely dude  It was like  Two or three weeks ago  Man  The fire trucks  Were parked in front  Of the house  They were on the scene  What town are we looking at  Oh dude  I can't remember man  It was on all the news  What's your news though  We're around  Where are you  It was on Fox News 
[01:27:30]  It was on  There's Fox News  In every town  Where do you live  Where do you live  Where  I live in New York  Orange County  It wasn't right by me  It was on the news  But it was just outside  Basically a city  Who are your anchors  Because I'm telling you  There's a Fox News  In every city  Help us out  They do a good job  Making believe  They're the only Fox  But there's one  Everywhere  Well I listened to  The one on XM  The Fox on XM  Whatever the hell that is  It's nationwide  Isn't it  Yeah that's the Fox  Wait so it was on 
[01:28:00]  Fox News channel  That's Sonny Fox  Or was it Sonny Fox  Yeah it was actually  A Bill Hicks record  No no  Fox News  Like the regular  Regular Fox News  Cable  No pay no spray  Firefighters let home burn  Thank you  We got it  Wow  Alright what's the story  Do we got the actual  News clip  Wasn't there a hooker  With that motto  No pay no spray  I would love to see  This on the news  But  Is there a video 
[01:28:30]  I don't think there is  I don't know  What did you say  People just wouldn't pay  In the fire department  They were just putting  The fires out  Are your counters  Bounty clean  I don't know  If my counters  Bounty clean  Could you just  Play the clip  Commercial before  Every clip now  It's just a nightmare  It really is  But that's  You know  The price we pay  For free videos  Free videos  Yeah  Otherwise they yank them  Yeah  Let's see  Now you can put it on  I can deal with this douche bag 
[01:29:00]  Countdown with Keith  Old Paul  Running  From New York  In both the small  And big picture  It represents the breakdown  Of government  A knowing hands off  Recklessly minimalist  Approach  An a la carte system  That openly invites  Specific destruction  In the short term  And the deconstruction  Of basic governmental services  In the long term  In our fifth story  The home that was allowed  To burn to the ground  Over a $75 fee  Not paid  Now drawing the cheers  Of some conservatives  Eager to defend the policy  And blame the victims 
[01:29:30]  With local county authorities  Evidently unmoved by this  The home of Gene and Paulette  Kranick burning  As firefighters watched  Because the Kranicks  Had failed to pay  Their $75 subscription fee  But last night  The Obeon County Budget Committee  Of Tennessee  Chosed to expand  The subscription only  Fire service  Pay to spray  The decision was  Two years in the making  And will not go into effect  Immediately  But also not changed  By recent events  Meantime  The prints of  Too bad for you  As well as other conservatives  Happily defending the system  And explaining how that system 
[01:30:00]  Worked exactly as intended  If you don't  Pay your $75  Then that hurts  The fire department  They can't use  Those resources  Yeah but  And you would be  Sponging off of  Your neighbor's  $75  If they put out  Your neighbor's house  And you didn't  Pay for it  I mean  If your neighbor  Didn't pay for it  Yeah we get that part of it  But this should have  Never been set up  In the first place  Yeah  Why don't we talk about  How this shouldn't 
[01:30:30]  Be set up in the first place  Well how about this  If they put it out  What the fuck  They just bill you  Yeah yeah  Put it out  And bill me  If those firemen  Sat there and watched  That house burn  They're fucking  Right  Scumbags  Trust me  They'll find the  $75 for you  Saving their house  They're scumbags  I don't care how you  Spin it  It's easy for Glenn Beck  To say you know  If you don't pay  This is what should happen  But the system  Shouldn't be set up  In that way  To begin with  You should be fighting  For the people  Exactly  For the people  Do you agree  Yeah  For my peoples  Actually 
[01:31:00]  Why is it  I was Glenn Beck  So I have to agree  But why does it  Come down to where  Now they gotta  Get money out of our pocket  To have  Basic services  Exactly  Why do we pay taxes  Exactly  The system itself  Should not be set up  That's what they should be  Yelling and screaming about  Wow it was a good call man  You're right  Yeah I don't  Thank you Jake  I don't agree with that at all  For 75 dollars  The whole world is going  A la carte by the way  It's everywhere  Obviously with the airlines  And now I didn't know  With the fire thing 
[01:31:30]  But again  For them to allow  Your life to burn like that  Even if you're being  A stubborn asshole  You can't evict  A shitty tenant  Yeah  Like  There's courts  There's a whole bunch  What if you had paid it  And the paperwork  Had gotten mixed up  Yeah  This is why these firemen  Are scumbags  If they watch that house burn  What if you had paid it  And there was a computer glitch  Yeah  That caused  And they actually did pay  Yeah  Then what  Are they responsible  For your whole fucking life  I say yes  That's really really terrible 
[01:32:00]  You know what  Here's the other thing  Maybe that family  Can't afford the fucking 75 dollars  Believe it or not  And had to cut some costs somewhere  And said well we'll take a chance  And hope our fucking house  Never burns down  Well that's a little rough  That's where the conservatives  Really are being twats  He says conservatives  Because he's Keith Olbermann  Yeah  But it was Glenn Beck  That was spelling it out  So he just  He just took the Glenn Beck  Paintbrush over everybody  Yeah yeah yeah  Because Olbermann's an asshole  Just as much as Beck is  Yeah I agree  But that is more 
[01:32:30]  I absolutely agree  That's more of a conservative ideology  Yeah  As far as you didn't pay  You don't get it  And I understand that  In a lot of cases  But when somebody's house  Is burning to the ground  It's a little bit different  Yeah  Because again  They don't hold the same philosophy  When it comes to obscenity  Like Stalliano was in here  Yeah  It's funny how they don't hold  That fucking philosophy  Of individuality  When it comes to  What you want to watch  In your home  With two guys  That want to fuck each other  In the ass  And want to get married  They don't hold that philosophy  No  So fuck them too  Maybe it was a hoarder 
[01:33:00]  I could only hope  It was a hoarder  And they said  Fuck her  And let it burn  I mean  If they got great video  Of the couple running in and out  Of the burning house  Begging and pleading  And bringing their shit out  Or trying to get the paperwork  Done real quick  When they're making calls  Then I understand  How about you  What would happen  If they would have just  Handed over $75  Here you go  Probably has to go  Through the proper channels  Of course  Or else it looks like a bribe  You want to  We'll head for a break  What scumbags 
[01:33:30]  Those firemen were  Right here in Brainerd  Take care of the fire  I know it's hard to believe  That people could be that cold  But they are  How do you respond  To those people  Who are saying today  That you got what you deserve  So now  Hold on  Can you pause this  Well  Oh Jesus  You got to point out  How sick the media is  Okay  Gene Kranick  Is an old hick  He's a boo  He's an old guy  And they set him up  For the big interview  In front of his burning house  It's his house  It's all burnt down  They gave him a stool  To sit on  In front of his burnt down house 
[01:34:00]  Look  This is what the media does  These cunts  Okay  They don't give a shit  About this guy  In his house  They want to make him  Make him look good on TV  So they set him up  In front of his burning house  It's perfect  How about you set him  How about you  Interview him in a hotel  Or a restaurant  Or something  Make him feel a little good  And they got lights  They got floodlights  On the remains of the house  Because it's dark  Yeah yeah  They backlit it  Just to make it hurt  It's great  But now what you're about to hear  Is Keith Overman  Feeling for the guy 
[01:34:30]  And all that horse shit  Now what you'll hear  Is Keith Overman  Completely  Trying to pin this  On every  Single Republican  And conservative  Go ahead  Spine to those people  Like this  Like the shoes  On the other foot  On their foot  See what happens  It happens  You're not wearing shoes  You hillbilly  I don't care  You forget things  And I did  Oh  I suffer  Consequences for it  So  I'm not a freeloader 
[01:35:00]  I've worked all my life  For everything I've got  And  And just in case  The  The shot isn't good enough  Now they got a montage  On the left side of the screen  Of his burned remains  They weighed him up here  At my son's house  And  Three years ago  In December  December  They weighed him at  Over on  Another road  Over here  In  Out of town  And saved  The guy's house  I guess it was a trailer 
[01:35:30]  Huh  But I know  They've weighed him before  So  Therefore  They could have  Waved mine  And I would have  Paid him  They did wave it  Goodbye  I don't know  If it was  Five hundred  Or five thousand  I'm surprised  MSNBC  Didn't put a little  Soot makeup  On the guy  Yeah  They should have  Sooted up his face  A little bit  A little blackface for him  Dude I understand  You gotta  You can't just keep  Sponging off the system  Like I get that philosophy  But when it comes to something  Like the fucking fire department  Or the police department 
[01:36:00]  Which are supposed to be covered  By the fucking  Fuck a la carte  When it comes to  Basic services  Which they're taxing you for  That's what your taxes  Are fucking for  I wonder if they have  A tax based  Fire department here  Yeah I wonder  Maybe not  Maybe not  Like Long Island  Is all volunteer fire departments  Right  They don't volunteer  They don't pay those guys  Which is crazy  Those are ballsy guys man  Isn't that ridiculous  They love  Occasionally because  Of volunteer firemen 
[01:36:30]  You gotta deal with  The old crazy  Pyro firemen  That gets in  And lights all the fires  So they can go  Oh yeah  Long Island's notorious  We've had a few  For those volunteer firemen  That just love fires  They like a good fire  I don't understand  I don't understand  As a fireman  Where you're taught to  You know  Save lives  And save property  That you just sit there  And watch this happen  It's like a doctor  That can  As a human being  I don't get it  It's a doctor  That doesn't let you  To the hospital  Or whatever  When you have  Like a real injury  Because of insurance  It's like  Some critical injuries 
[01:37:00]  They have to operate on  And secondly  I didn't know  The Jimmy Dean  Sausage guy's house  Burned out  So I burnt up  Palmer sausage  Sausage  Sausage  At least I had  Some delicious sausage  Sausage seat  While my house  Burned out  Continue there  Goers  Goers  Libertarian fire department  Spray the house down  Put it out  Oh okay  No  They sprayed the fence  My understanding  Is that you've heard  About some of the coverage  On some of the other  Cable networks today  About this 
[01:37:30]  People who said  That it doesn't matter  That rule has to be enforced  What do you think  About that point of view  The coverage on Fox News  For instance  What do you  Can you pause that  Yeah  How does  Fuck it  This is where  Oberman is just  A small twat  How do you tie this  Into  Why are you watching  Fox News  Asshole  Did he have to go  Fox News  For instance  Like let me pull one  Out of my ass  Fox News  Like will you stop  I love  I love how TV 
[01:38:00]  Obsessing  There's a story  By the way  What  Charging for crashes  Oh can we get that audio  So we can get the tier  The actual  Payment plan  Is anybody working  For the show today  Did Iraq even know  This story was happening  Today  He put his prep sheet  To go  Hmm  What were we going to say  Oh  The TV news  Business  Yeah  Is going in the way  Of radio wars  Yeah it really is  They got TV wars  Going on  TV wars  Jimmy makes a good point  Why don't you just do  Your shit  Keith 
[01:38:30]  And not worry about  The Fox thing so much  Yep  I know that's coming  From us  And we've had our  Battles  I understand that  But we're just  Doping radio guys  Not the  Fucking news  Obsessing about  How Fox  Covered this story  That is sickening man  That really makes me sick  I'll say to this  The else  To those people  That  They don't know  The whole story  About everything  And they shouldn't  Be judging people  When they don't 
[01:39:00]  Know what they're  Talking about  The idea  That  That this  Has to  If they had  Somehow  Gone in  And put out  The fire  Without you  Having paid  That that would  Hurt the system  That that would  Punish all the  People that did  Pay  Does that make  Any sense  To you  No it don't  Because I would  Have paid  I offered to pay  I told them  I'd pay  Whatever it took  And they didn't do it  From what we're  Gathering  From looking into  This today  It looks like 
[01:39:30]  The firefighters  Do not like  This system  The politicians  Apparently like  This system  How do you  Respond to  That  Disagreement  Between those  Two parties  Well  I don't know  But  I did  Understand  That  The man  Was calling  The shots  On this fire  And told them  Not to put  No water on it  Yeah  Was there  Within a half  A mile  Of playing golf  He was playing  Golf right down  Here on the  Golf course  Within a half 
[01:40:00]  A mile  That really  Tells you  That they  Really care  No wonder  We can't get  Any industry  And anything  In this little  Town around  So why  Should I  Want to put up  A business  Or build  A new home  Around  When  When  They're not  Going to do  They're not  Going to do  You  Treat you  Right  And another  Thing is  I don't know  Whether I'm  Right or  Whether I'm  Wrong  I hadn't  Researched it  Yet  But part of  My tax dollars  Comes back 
[01:40:30]  To this town  I think  Oh my god  It's more  Of the story  Pause that  For far  Jokes  Doesn't shut  Up  Right  We get it  Get house  Burnt down  Shut up  Georgia  What do you  Got  Yeah  The rest  Of the story  Obviously he said  He tried to pay  For the house  To be put out  But the next day  He got arrested  For assault  Because he went  Downtown and  Punched the fire  Chief in the face  Good  I love it  Good  I love it  Punching out  Very good  Very good brother  Is that true  Punched him in the face  Alright back to the story  Thing is the one that goes 
[01:41:00]  In their general fund  They don't just use it  For fire trucks  Or the police department  Or whatever  Far  And I know for a fact  That they take their prisoners  When they take the prisoners  They built this new thing up here  About three and a half million dollars  And I understood  They're supposed to have a jail in it  But they don't  They take all their prisoners over to  The county  Over at Union City  To the county  So what do they even need  All that up there for  They're not going to use it 
[01:41:30]  That they could afford  But your 75 dollars  They could not afford  Let me ask you this  Let me get  To see what  If there's something  A little nicer to this story  Than we've told everybody about  And I know you're living in it  And none of it's nice for you  But what's the reaction  Of your neighbors  To this  I mean you mentioned  Your neighbor was willing  To pay on the spot  As you were  As this fire was going on  Has it generally been  Compassionate  And neighborly  Most everybody  Has been compassionate 
[01:42:00]  And neighborly  That means there's one asshole  Most everybody  What about that asshole  I paid my money  Fuck him  Fuck him  Fuck him  Fuck him  What do they say right there  A guy from the city what  From the big city  Most everybody  Has been compassionate  And neighborly  And I talked to a guy  From the city today  He lives up in the city  And he said he hated it  But that was their rule up there  But he hated it 
[01:42:30]  That it happened  And  This guy sounds stupid though  He hated it  He sounds stupid  I understood some of the firefighters  Went home and was sick  Yep  Some of them even cried over it  They should have just  Fucking put the fire out  You know what  They're ballsy guys  Then it would have been their job  Yeah maybe so  They probably got fired  Yeah  Unfortunately  They were in a tough spot too  I'm sure  They're not  When you see a fucking guy's house burning  Plug the fucking hose in  And fucking put the water on it  You would have been a hero 
[01:43:00]  You would have been everywhere  As the guy said  Fuck the system  I gotta do the right thing  As a human being  And put this guy's fire out  What a lousy  Is that a libertarian ideology  Because libertarians  Are always crawling  How great their system is  Might be  But if they're that  Completely detached  From human suffering  Then they're shit  Yeah  It's a sick story  It's sickening dude  It's sick where this  Whole country's going  With this  What a bunch of  Fuck  What a bunch of  Fucking twats  Just watching the  End of the Roman Empire 
[01:43:30]  Right here  Laugh along  Have fun people  You're watching the  Tail end of the  New Roman Empire  Great country  United States of America  I'm obsessed with  How the compassionate  Interview is set up  Keith like  Alright we gotta  Talk to you  How can I bash Fox News  That's top priority  And then let's make sure  We have the guy  In front of his  Burnt house  And then on the  Left side of the screen  Let's please do a  Montage of everything  He owns and loves  Burning  Yeah just  In flames  But I'm gonna be  Compassionate through  The whole thing 
[01:44:00]  Don't you worry  And do we have  The flood lights set up  On the remains of the house  Because it's dark  I really want people  To understand that  This guy sitting in front  Of his burnt house  Get that burning  I think it's that  Talking flapping fish  Plaque thing  That he probably had  On his wall  Right  Could you get that  Still smoldering  Hopefully  Yes  Lay that by his side  As I do my  Compassionate interview  With this guy  And they all  The tough talk  Conservatives  Ah you know  He didn't pay up  That's what he gets  Really  Did they all click  Like that  Oh yeah  Really  So why don't you 
[01:44:30]  Suck a dick  In a fucking  Bathroom stall  Fuck it  I can't  Really the conservatives  Are really beginning  To annoy me  With this shit  This holier than thou  Shit  Speaking of conservatives  I don't really  Acknowledge or respect  Glenn Beck  But what is  What is our boy  Hannity doing  I don't agree with him  But I respect the guy  What was his take on this  I don't think his take  I don't think he would  Agree with this  Knowing him  I could be wrong  But I don't think he would  He's not as crazy  As fucking Glenn Beck is  Yeah  Glenn Beck is like a lunatic  I've watched his show  A few times  And I'm just like  This guy just doesn't 
[01:45:00]  Seem right  The one  Seems kind of  I thought you would  Agree with him  Really fucked up  In the head  Why does Glenn Beck  Even believe in insurance  You think he's paying  For cash  He's just cash  Out of his pocket  For his fucking  For his diet  His aspartame issues  Yeah  You think he's just  Paying all that  Cash  Or is he going  Through insurance  I know he pays  Into his insurance  But it's like  Why even have  That kind of system  Why not just pay cash  Pay as you go  Why not  Yeah  It would  It would be the way  To do it  God they really  Start with annoy me  With that shit  You want to play 
[01:45:30]  The rest of the interview  It's just a little  More to go  There's a great  Special on HBO  By the way  Most of them  Are conservatives  About all these  Anti-gay activists  And anti-gay politicians  That are gay  That are fucking  Cocksuckers  And I love the fact  That they're fucking  Because they're not  People who are like  Celebrities  Or people just  You know whatever  Those are people  Actively lobbying  In that  Against  Actively lobbying  Against  Against their own  Fucking people  That lifestyle  Right  As they're 
[01:46:00]  Sucking the gay  Oh I love the fact  Who's the one  That was humiliated  Larry something  That bigger  Big or anti-gay  You know one of those guys  One of those staunch guys  And he was  Oh he loved  Cocks  He loved it  Loved it  Larry Craig  Oh I love when  These guys are fucking  I just wish most of them  Once their lives  Are uprooted like that  Would just blow  Their brains out  Oh  Let's finish the interview  Dick  The compassion interview  By Keith Oberman  Let me ask you one more  And then we'll let you go 
[01:46:30]  Again with our thanks  What's next for you  And the family  So you can sweep up  Right now  I don't know  We haven't talked  We've got to wait  Till our insurance company  Insurance  Comes around  And says it's alright  To clean up  And everything  And then we'll clean up  And we'll go from there  Will we bill back now  Or later  We'll be  We'll just have to  Make a decision later  On this  Alright  So we may not  Build back  And then again  We may bill 
[01:47:00]  Something  I don't have any idea  Couldn't build on the spot  You couldn't just pay it  On the spot  We'll be in touch  With you  If we  No you won't  You'll move on  To the next story  That's what you  Assholes do  Shut the fuck up  Why did it have to be  Paid in advance  Literally if he was  Going to pay the 75  Why  Unless it's just  A way to fuck people  Couldn't they have  Paid it right there  Yeah  Well no  It would affect the system  But why  Because then everyone else  Would think  They could just pay  On the spot  That's why  I'm more obsessed  With why is this  System in place 
[01:47:30]  Then how about  They just be honest  About what it is  This is where  Beck should be honest  It's vindictive  And it's  Fuck you  We told you so  But don't act like  It's hurting the system  Because if somebody  Could just hand you  The 75 dollars  Yeah  And then you could  Put it in  What's the difference  Financially  That's probably not  No but the problem is  They're not collecting  All that money  Because it's like  An insurance thing  Technically  Let's say you have  A thousand houses  In this area  I don't know  They're all paying  Their 75 dollars  That's a lot of money  For the town  Or the fire department  Whoever gets it  Yeah 
[01:48:00]  So then if you  Allow this guy  To just pay on the spot  Then everyone else is like  Why the fuck am I  Paying the 75 bucks  I can pay on the spot  If my house is burning down  So I see that part of it  Now they're not getting  That money coming in  But once again  I question  Why is that system  In place  To begin with  They should have  Let this guy  Pay his 75 fucking dollars  And then realized  The system is flawed  And they gotta figure  Something else out  But is that a libertarian ideology  I need a TV show  Holy shit  I don't know  There it is right there  I don't know  There it is  I don't know  I don't know where  This comes from  It's disgusting 
[01:48:30]  I've never heard of this  As a matter of fact  Yeah but this is on top  Of the fact that  Now you're paying  If you get in an accident  That we learned today  The fact that they would not  Take his money on the spot  When he offered it  Like I don't care  If he was late  Why  Like if they had said  Look pay up  And he goes  No I'm not paying  While it burned  That's different  Because it probably  Would have cost the firefighters  Their jobs  I'm not  I'm not willing  I'm not willing  Right now  To totally  I would agree  With Anthony  I'm not bashing them  I'm bashing that system  And if they  Don't like the system 
[01:49:00]  And it's the politics  Behind it  They're probably  Following the letter  Of the law  To get it changed  FDNY wants to charge a fee  To respond to an accident scene  Yeah so  We gotta get that audio  Because this is the same  Type of thing  This a la carte shit  And I agree with Anne  I agree  I believe that some of these  Fire guys went home  And cried and puked  They couldn't believe  They had to do  What they had to do  That day  But you know  People are scared  Of losing their jobs too  Yeah you don't want  To lose your livelihood  Because you did  The right thing  It's you know 
[01:49:30]  Fuck that  I would have had to  Put the fire on  I'll do the wrong thing  I would have had to  And I'm not just saying  That to be a brave guy  I don't know how  You just sit there  Knowing you have a hose  That you can just  You know  Turn on  And go to town  Wow  Unbelievable story  That's fucked up  Also I'm getting more info  And I believe  I can believe  This guy on Twitter  He says the guy's  Dogs burned to death also  He didn't talk about that  Really  Lost my dogs  Guy on Twitter  Usually has good info  They might have been  Burned to death before though 
[01:50:00]  Who knows  If they were on fire  At the moment  They probably started  The fire  Dumb dogs  With their stupid tails  Knocking over a candle  Exactly  Trying to get to  The peanut butter  They thought it was  Peanut butter time  Peanut butter time  Can we go to break  With sausage guy  Sausage  Because that guy  Sounded like sausage guy  So here's sausage guy  The news with Big A  And rolling next  And now  This is the Opie and Anthony  Show  On the virus  Sirius XM

[01:51:30]  Everybody has off  Monday  It's a great weekend  Love all you guys  That are performing  I love the Borgata  Yeah  And uh  Yeah  It should be a good time  Uh  You want to take a phone call  From someone that says  Love you Jim  But  Okay yeah of course  I'm a big fan of the  I love you but  Phone calls  Well you might just  Disagree with my take  On something  That's fine  Mark in South Carolina  Hi Mark  Hey Jimmy  I love you  But you are  Completely wrong  About the whole  Fire department thing  Okay  Alright I am a 
[01:52:00]  Fire marshal  21 years in South Carolina  When I first started  In the fire service  We had what  This gentleman  Is living in  It's called  No man's land  In other words  He doesn't pay taxes  For fire protection  Or public safety  Or anything  He lives in the country  And what has happened  There is a few people  Around where he lives  That says  Hey  We would like to get  Some fire protection  But we can't afford it  So the only thing  They can do is  Look  If we pay  Like an insurance policy  Now what the guy  Is basically saying 
[01:52:30]  Is that  Oh I had a car wreck  So I need to call  State Farm  And pay my policy  So they'll pay  This insurance  Can I jump in real quick  I understand  What you're saying there  But there is a difference  Between trying to  Retroactively get insurance  And a bunch of  People watching  Your house  Burn to the ground  To me that's the equivalent  Of an ambulance  Showing up  As you're laying  In the accident wreck  And going  Well you didn't pay  So we're not going  To take you to the hospital 
[01:53:00]  But what it does  When the gentleman  Doesn't pay  That means  Well his neighbor  Says well he paid  When it's on fire  Why should I pay  Because see  The problem is that  The people that are  Actually paying the taxes  For this fire department  They expect them to be  In their fire district  To protect their houses  Not some yeehaw  That decides  Oh I'll pay  Whenever I need it  It's not a pay as you go  Because if they don't pay  Then there's no fuel  There's no training  There's no equipment  I do  Look I understand 
[01:53:30]  And I should know  More than anything  Because my parents' house  Was in no man's land  When I was five years old  And they watched it burn down  Which then in turn  Turned me into a fireman  Can I ask you something  As a fire marshal though  How do you stand  In front of a burning house  And not put the fire out  As a human being  I understand the system  You explained it perfectly  But as a human being  How do you  How can you let that happen  Well actually  In South Carolina  And basically  Most incorporated areas  There's no such thing 
[01:54:00]  As no man's land anymore  Because the fire protection  Has spread out  This basically  Has ended  Back in the  Mid 80s to 90s  Now there are some  Little small rural  I'm not slamming  That particular town  Or anything  But there are still  Instances there  And the main reason  That they're there  Is because you have  People like this gentleman  That by God  I pay enough taxes  I ain't paying for that shit  Well that's the problem  You didn't answer my question  How do you do that  How is a human being  And someone that 
[01:54:30]  Dedicated themselves  To putting out fires  And saving property  And saving lives  Do you stand on a curb  And watch someone's  House burn down  I get  I get the system  That is set up  And why it's set up  But I want to know  What goes through  Your soul  Basically  Okay basically  You're there  Because if there was  A life involved  They would have responded  They would have done  Whatever they had to do  To save that life  But this is property  Alright  Property can be replaced  You know what  Do I need to put 
[01:55:00]  My wife on the line  For property  I don't know  Ask those nine firemen  In Charleston  South Carolina  That died  In property  Say we've got to  Justify  Is it worth the risk  Why wouldn't  Let me ask you  Why wouldn't they  Take the $75  On the  Here's what this was  It was punishment  Why  And my thing is  This culture  That we are in  This society  It's so inconsistent  Because this  Hey  You didn't pay  You don't get it  What about the neighbor  None of us 
[01:55:30]  Hold ourselves  To that horse shit standard  Like  As a man  Let's say you  I'm sure you have kids  Right  Yeah  Oh yeah  I got five kids  And let's say  You were going to the hospital  And one of your kids  Was injured  Broken arm  Or maybe something  A little more serious  And there was a glitch  In your insurance paper  And the hospital  Wouldn't admit your kid  You wouldn't go  Well that is the system  Technically  You want to wring  That motherfucker's neck  Well actually  That's completely different  Because they're obligated 
[01:56:00]  If there is life involved  They have a duty to act  And that's what the actual law  Is called  A duty to act  No no but  Mark I'm not saying that  I'm saying the point is  You wouldn't hold yourself  To that same  Harsh standard  None of us would  Sure  Oh actually  And that's what I'm saying  I grew up watching my house  Burn down  Because it was  In no man's land  And that made you  Become a fire guy  Fire marshal  I'm sorry  But the thing is  Jimmy  It boils down to  Alright  If they don't pay 
[01:56:30]  Then why should  You know  If they put the fire out  Why should I even do that  Why should I pay  Because I can pay  Whenever I need it  I got that  If that happens  And you can say  Well he's losing his property  He's losing this  Well A  That's what he has insurance for  And B  That's what  He needed to pay  Whatever fees  For their no man's land  Because you know what  That fire department  Wasn't even his fire department  I understand  That's why I'm saying  My house is burning  Why is it New York City  I understand  I understand  Over and over again 
[01:57:00]  We understand the system  I mean the other part of the story  Is maybe the guy just didn't know  He didn't sound like  He was a bright guy  No he didn't  And that mentality  And Opie's right  But that mentality  Is disgusting to me  Because let's just say  Those firemen sitting there  Had such faith in the system  That they knew 100%  That he hadn't paid  And there hadn't been a glitch  Haven't you ever had payments  Or problems  With a computer  Or something that doesn't get filed  What if that guy had paid 
[01:57:30]  And there had been a problem  And a problem processing his payment  A clerical error  That mentality would cause them  To sit there  And watch his property burn  Over a $75 fee  That he actually had  Do you understand  What shit that mentality is  Well absolutely  Absolutely  And the thing is  Guess what  It's either the $75  Or you don't have a chance at all  And that's what it boils down to  Right okay  Because that's not their fire district  They have no business  All right  You explained it perfectly 
[01:58:00]  It's funny  It's funny on 9-11  And again of course  There were heroes to drive in  But there are times  When you don't think of stuff like that  Right  You just react  Right  You know what I mean  Firefighters  There were lives involved  There were lives involved  Not a shit  No no I do  I'm not  Again you keep repeating that  And I understand it  I am not knocking firemen  For driving in on 9-11  I'm praising them  But I'm saying  When something is happening  When a guy's house  Is burning to the ground  You fucking put the fire out  All right  The thing is also  They don't tell you  That when they arrived on the scene  The house was already  To the ground almost 
[01:58:30]  Yeah I figure  He was probably already  In bad shape  All right  Mark thanks for  Giving us a little insight  Yes sir  Jimmy  I know we disagree  But you know what  I love you  And every night  Before I go to bed  I look at my wife  And say  Thank you very much  You can love me  And disagree  That's part of  Being a couple  Thanks man  I want to move on  To the news  Of Big A and Roland  A bunch of firefighters  Just acknowledged  And said they would  Absolutely have to  Put the fire out  Of course yeah  And there's other guys  Saying that  If they did put out 
[01:59:00]  The fire  When they were told  Not to  And god forbid  Something happens to them  Then their families  Wouldn't get benefits  There's all sorts of  Fucking shit  Going on with this story  Obviously  The whole system  Just stinks  Yeah yeah yeah  It's a disgusting system  Yeah the idea  Is flawed I think  That we as a country  As individuals  We expect compassion  And we show very little  But yet we  We would demand compassion  That we wouldn't show  And that's what  Bob  That's what I was saying  About  Of course I know  There's a difference  In property and life  And the point is 
[01:59:30]  That none of us  Would hold ourselves  To that standard  Of course  Where's Big A  Where's Roland  Oh  Uh oh  There's a well  Roland's downstairs  Taking care of our guest  She came early  Her publicist did  Oh great  So we can't  We love publicists  But we could just  Skip Roland's parts  And just do a quick news  With Big A  I mean  It works way better  With fucking Roland  I like Roland  Big A  Kenny could do the news  Kenny  Kenny can't do anything  No offense  I mean can he  Kenny  Kenny's not worth anything 
[02:00:00]  Excuse me  I mean  If we need something  We want Roland  We could have  Big A doing the news  And then like  The virus comes in  And tries to think  Of a punchline  Based on each news story  That would just  Embarrass Eric  If he's not having  A great day  Hold on  Excuse me  Give me that  Which one did you get  What is it  Uh oh  The Star Wars trilogy  Let me say  Got the wrong one  Let me say  Yeah  That's the wrong one  That's great  She doesn't sign that  Oh no  She's not even in these  Nope  These are the ones  They made after 
[02:00:30]  Uh  You had me  Until you made this face  I made the  Yeah  Thank you Kenny  As soon as she  When she comes in  I'm going to leave it  Right there  So um  I'm just saying this story  With the pen attached to it  Yeah  Sharpie  Please sign  Well  That sucks  We were supposed to do  The news with  Roland and Big A  I know  We're prepared for  Big A though  Are we  The Big A  Why don't we get  That lummux in here  And at least talk to him 
[02:01:00]  I see Roland down the hallway  Roland Roland  Can he come back down  Now that the publicist  Is hanging out  There's the Big A  See if Roland can do this  What's up Big A  How are you man  How are you guys  Oh just Marvy Parvy  That's terrific  Have you lost a few pounds  Uh definitely  I don't know how many  But um definitely  Have you lost weight  Yeah you look like  A little bit thinner  Yeah I have  It's like saying the ocean  Looks a little drier  But I mean  Yeah you're losing weight

[02:03:00]  Get that weight off yeah  Yeah get your weight off  Oh yeah  Then you can get in the weight back  Cause that's what everyone does  But at least  At least lose it all  Whatever for a little while people will be like wow that was great  Yeah  Feel good about yourself  Sure  So you're exercising and trying to eat better  Oh yeah yeah  Alright we worry about you big A  Totally  I'm breaking character here  We worry about you  You do a little treadmill or something like that  Get a little exercise to get the heart going slow  Yeah sure  Alright you do look like you lost some weight though  I was teasing you but I was like  Yeah he does look like you lost  Does he?  Yeah yeah  Absolutely  How much have you lost? 
[02:03:30]  I don't know  Cause most scales don't go up to a certain  How much do you weigh?  Well I was in the hospital  It was about 413  413?  413 pounds  That's the last time  And  Oh it has to be less than that  But I don't know exactly  Cause most scales don't go up to like  About 350  What does his scale go up to? 
[02:04:00]  Can we check?  Even though he's got clothes on  Yeah  I don't know what our scale goes up to  I don't think our scale goes up to 400 pounds  Well I'm happy to hear you're worried that you weren't  Cause you want to stay alive right?  Oh yes  Absolutely  No he was thinking that death would be good  Oh my wick up call  But you have one alright  Yeah  Alright  Because the  Like one of the doctors who did  You know check my arteries  Told me if I continue eating  I'm eating  In six months  You know  Yeah you gotta stop  I know the fattening food is tasty 
[02:04:30]  But it's not worth it  No no I'm eating  Eight whites  Back back onto the scales  And showing he doesn't give a shit  Just waiting for the next joke  It's terrible  It's the worst  God came out one at a time  That's a great Rodney joke man  What's it say?  It's hovering right around 399 
[02:05:00]  Is that what it goes to 400 or no?  I'm not sure  It keeps going  It's going between 398 and 400  It works like the fucking  The computer in War Games  When he got on it went  Hello Eric  So he might have lost 10-13 pounds  Somewhere around there maybe  No  Unless the scale's fucked up  That's a good start Big A  Keep it up alright  It'd be funny if he got anoractic  And was like 110  Yeah that'll happen

Drill Sergeant's a great game.  Oh, we played this once.  I love this one.  I want to see, what the thing is this.  Toe to toe.  Yeah, you're at E-Rock, you're the fucking, you are the, uh, you are the, you ever see 
[02:15:30]  Full Metal Jacket, Big A?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Um, E-Rock, you, because I want to see, when you stand there, E-Rock, you get right in  his face and you got to say, when I say jump, you say how high, but you have to yell it at  E-Rock like you're a drill sergeant.  Right in his face.  Toe to toe.  Right in his face to face.  Toe to toe.  When I, but you got to say the line right.  When I say, when I say jump, you say how high.  Like that.  Toe to toe.  No, wait, no, hold on.  Yeah, toe to toe.  You have to say to him, stand still, when I say jump, you say how high. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Stand still, when I say jump, you say how high.  And yell it.  You're angry at him.  Yeah.  He was just making fun of you.  Look him in the eye.  Come on, toe to toe.  Yeah, look him in the eye like a drill sergeant.  Um, um, stand still.  When I say jump.  You say how high.  Right.  When I say jump, you say how high.  Andrew, you didn't mean it. 
[02:16:30]  He's making noises.  You got to say it with authority, you know.  Be intimidating.  Yeah, like Kenny.  Just think of Kenny trying to be nice.  Yeah, toe to toe.  Honestly, when you see this in movies, you actually see the spit flying into the other  guy's face.  Oh, yeah, that's crazy.  You guys got to be almost nose to nose.  Yeah, I've seen that before.  Yeah, don't be scary, Andrew.  It's a movie.  You got to get right in his face.  Exactly.  As close as humanly possible without kissing him.  He's the incompetent longhead who showed up late today.  Let's go. 
[02:17:00]  Move in, Andrew.  Come on.  Fuck, I'll be scared.  Give it to him.  When I say jump, you say how high.  But he forgot to stand still.  Yeah, start over.  Come on, B.A.  Fuck him.  Don't let that punk hit you, eh?  All right, here we go.  He just threw up on B.A.'s shirt. 
[02:17:30]  He just threw up.  Face it.  B.A.  You threw up on B.A.  Oh, no.  B.A., you're throwing up.  B.A.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong with B.A.?  You all right?  He got grossed out because...  I think B.A.'s going to throw up.  E-Rock spit up on him.  All right, sure.  You good?  I'm good.  Is it all?  Let me get away with that.  Yeah, go give him the business.  You all right, B.A.?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look at stupid Roland outside the window, touching his wrist like a time. 
[02:18:00]  I hope you show him this when he's going to cut.  What's going on?  Carrie Fisher time?  Yeah, we need her on in five minutes.  Where is she?  She's right.  She's just got here.  All right.  She's here?  Yeah, she's been here for 20 minutes.  And he's picking out.  What?  Carrie Fisher has been where?  In the office.  Oh, my God.  She's here?  What the fuck?  What is she doing waiting?  I've been emailing and texting, but nobody paid attention.  Dude, we didn't bring her right in.  We're doing a radio bit.  All right.  You should have brought her down. 
[02:18:30]  We had no idea.  All right, you two.  We'll apologize.  We'll smooth things over.  She was scheduled for nine, though.  She came in early.  All right.  All right.  Bring her right in.  Yeah, let's bring her in.  Get her right in.  Leave the door open for a minute.  She's a big star.  Air this place out.  She's going to think we all stink.  Dude, that is so fucking funny, man.  That is so fucking funny.  Drill Sergeant has potential.  We just got working on it a little bit.  I'm going to ask her.  That has potential.  First question I'm going to ask her is, what smelled worse, the trash compactor in Star Wars or this studio  right now? 
[02:19:00]  That's embarrassing.  I did not know she was here.  What happened?  No.  That's fine.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's going to think the guy in the hallway is in a Jabba the Hutt costume.  I was thinking of that, too.  God damn it.  I feel bad she was waiting.  Where is she?  Well, now we're waiting.  Yeah.  Now we have to wait.  Now we have to wait.  Because they said the publicist was here.  They didn't tell us she was here.  That's all right.  No, I don't like to make it.  You know, she's fucking...  Hold on, I'm just going to walk her down.  I mean, how are we supposed to know? 
[02:19:30]  I'm not a mind fucking reader.  You are.  You always know when I feel sexy.  That's true.  Good point.  I have to pee, too.  God damn me.  My notes.  Oh, the sex doll.  Oh, yeah.  Electric shock therapy.  What?  Yeah.  What is that?  She got a little electric shock.  Oh, right, right, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  That's what they were going to give O.J.  Oh, yes, of course.  Electric shock O.J.  One of my fucking giant songs.  The classics.  One of my giant got-me-into-radio songs.  For the people at home, this would have been where we would have played a break.  Right, we would have just gone to break.  Oh, yeah.  To keep the show sounding kind of smooth.  I thought she was down in the office right here.  I think that's where she was, right?  Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  And there's Carrie Fisher.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:20:30]  Rolling, rolling, rolling.  Yeah, da-dee-dee-dee-do-dee-da.  La-da-dee-dee-dee-doo.  Rolling, rolling, rolling.  As we wait for Carrie Fisher.  That piss so badly, too.  We wait for Carrie Fisher.  Carrie Fisher is coming down the hall.  She's coming into the studio.  She's going to sit down.  We'll talk to us all.  Uh-oh.  Turn that rhyme.  Turn this music off.  I think we're going to be the other version of her today.  Good. 
[02:21:00]  It's embarrassing.  It's good rhyming.  I know.  Really good.  I don't want to do that.  Hi.  Hi, Carrie.  Hi.  Hi, Carrie Fisher.  Carrie Fisher, everyone.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're good.  Thank you.  It's very early in the morning.  We didn't know.  We knew that your publicist had arrived.  We didn't know you were here.  Yeah, we apologize.  We didn't want to have you waiting.  It's all right.  I was reading this shit.  Oh, the post.  Yeah, the post is a big pile of shit.  It is true.  Well, we all saw Wishful Drinking.  That's going to be on HBO Sunday night at 9 o'clock. 
[02:21:30]  And we all loved it.  Look at that.  We all saw it where?  We have copies.  We're a big show.  We get copies ahead of time.  Yeah, we're good like that.  And then they explode after we take them out so we can't upload them or anything.  That's good, because I wouldn't want anyone else to see it.  No, no.  I didn't even invite anybody over to watch it with me.  I didn't want them to know.  It's a huge secret.  That's it.  I know.  And, you know, that bootlegging thing.  You don't want to do that.  No, no.  Well, I want to, but I don't want other people to.  I sold my copy to the Asians down in Chinatown, so I'm good.  Oh, you know what's going to happen there?  I got a nice payday, so. 
[02:22:00]  I'm sure you did.  They're making copies as we speak.  Because of all the nude scenes in it.  What was the, this one was amazing to me, because it was almost, it was like, it's a one-person  show, and it was kind of like almost stand-up, because it was audience interaction.  But I love the fact that you had your shoes off.  There was something so comfortable looking.  Well, the rugs look comfortable.  But it really looked like, everyone tries to capture this vibe when they do a one-person  show, where they want you to feel like you're in their living room, and it really did feel  that way.  I actually wanted to serve, you know, like Doritos and dip and stuff like that, but they 
[02:22:30]  wouldn't let me.  Why?  Because they said that someone would be able to, you know, claim that they were poisoned.  Sue you.  Oh, God.  Oh, it's getting ridiculous.  Things are only fun when lawyers get involved, by the way.  Yeah, we love the lawyers.  They know fun, and funny, and creative.  They actually invented it.  Yeah, you always have to go filter everything through them first, to really wring out anything  spontaneous and fun. 
[02:23:00]  Well, I wasn't allowed to do that.  I used to think about, I used to think about, what if it was packaged food?  Yeah.  What about kosher?  Someone chokes, and you're done.  So stupid.  You're just done.  You see Carrie just run out into the crowd, give them a Heimlich maneuver.  It's like, she's a hero, now I'm going to sue her.  Now, Jimmy said how it looks very comfortable.  Like, you know, we were watching you in your living room.  The other thing I loved about it was your honesty.  No one is honest like that.  They aren't?  Not on your level, Carrie Fisher.  Not on your level.  A lot of people kind of want to protect their image and this and that. 
[02:23:30]  Well, my image was shot anyway.  That's true.  It isn't like I'm telling people things that, oh, no one knew that before.  But you give insight.  Like, it starts, I don't want to give everything away, but it starts where you tell the audience  that you found a guy dead in your bed.  Yep.  Who admits that?  Well, it was in the paper, though.  Yeah, but not everyone reads the paper.  More people now know that there was a dead guy in Carrie Fisher's bed.  I didn't know until I watched this thing that's going to be on HBO Sunday at 9 o'clock. 
[02:24:00]  That's what happens when you get in bed with me.  No, he, uh, at this point.  Uh, no, uh, it was in the paper and it, it was inaccurately report.  I was, but I couldn't talk about that for years.  I guess.  And there's, there is a part of me that goes, you want to hear something really awful?  You know, uh, but I, I, I tell people they can ask me questions about it and they don't  think I'm serious. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  How's it like to find someone dead in your bed?  They're fabulous.  It's fantastic.  Just as you would assume, it is just, you know, what you're thinking at the time is  how great that he felt relaxed enough that he could die in bed.  Cause you're not really says something about my hospitality.  I've slept with enough women who I thought were.  Was he, uh, and they probably went, you were.  Yeah.  Was he a, was he a boyfriend of. 
[02:25:00]  He was gay.  So yes, he was a boyfriend.  Uh, he was a gay Republican and I believe being a Republican has something to do with  his death.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's a lot of stress for a gay guy to be a Republican.  A lot of them.  I don't know.  He didn't seem to bother him.  I have no, any, you know, also probably because he did a lot of drugs.  That could be it.  Was it a drug thing or was he?  That could help him reconcile.  Or was he sick?  No.  Well, you know, he was, he was someone who abused, how do you not abuse drugs though? 
[02:25:30]  But anyway, I'll think about them that later.  Abuse, the word use is an abuse.  So yeah.  Anything there?  If you're using it, aren't you abusing it?  No, I am.  But I don't know about other people.  I mean, if you're just using them.  He died of sleep apnea.  Oh.  Get big A back in here.  Coupled with OxyContin use.  Oh.  Okay.  All right?  Definitely a big addition.  Chuck, listen, though.  You think that's a bad combo, Jimmy? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  OxyContin is not a great combo.  Did you ever do it?  I never did.  Oh, God, yeah.  I quit getting high years ago before OxyContin.  I missed out on that.  You missed some great drugs.  I really did.  I got out when I got back in just to try the OxyContin.  Chuck's for that.  I heard so many good things about it.  Great stuff.  Delve right back in.  Most of the people that are raving are dead.  But still.  Yeah, true.  No, but he only took three.  It wasn't like he could have overdosed.  If you did separate the, you know, I found him, as it were. 
[02:26:30]  I'm right next to him.  Wow.  It's not like I come across him.  I found him laying on his back.  He'd drown.  What do they call that?  Aspirated.  Wow.  Blah, blah.  But he'd only taken, he had not taken enough of that drug.  Right.  To kill someone.  He'd taken three.  Now, when I was taking them, come on, that was like for starters.  Three.  Yeah.  Were you really doing coke, too, when you were, there's a, oh, she was doing coke when she  was doing Star Wars.  Were you getting high back then, or was it, did your thing really kick in later? 
[02:27:00]  But, like, no, it kicked in, I mean, I was in my 20s then.  When are they going to kick in now?  I'd go to my AARP meetings, you know, bloated for bear.  But, yeah, no, I had a friend of mine that was working on the, we did snort coke a little  bit on the ice planet Hoth. 
[02:27:30]  You really couldn't see it much better.  We snorted the set.  You could hide it, yes, you could hide it much better.  No, but, I mean, you really, it wasn't like we were stumbling around, you know, our outer  space step, uh, set spaced out, but, uh, you know, there were a couple of days, I was  22.  Yeah.  Yeah, and, and it was the, you know, 70s.  And there's a lot of sound time and, yeah.  It's the 70s, everyone's, you know, and, and I was an idiot.  I mean, there's like a great combination.  Well, that, that leads me to the next, uh, uh, thing. 
[02:28:00]  This show, I'm telling you, uh, huge thumbs up.  Sunday, 9 p.m. on HBO.  It's called, uh, Wishful Drinking with Carrie Fisher.  She's hilarious and very open.  Uh, you talk about your Star Wars, uh, experience, and I, I get the feeling you're not a big fan  of, uh, Mr. Lucas.  I'm a huge fan of his.  They have to, no.  Like he owns your, uh.  He does own my likeness, and I don't like that.  You don't like that part of it.  That's why I wanted to ask you about it.  Don't like that, no.  I got the feeling that it might have, uh, gone deeper than that, but you're saying  no. 
[02:28:30]  No, I mean, he, and by the way, I think he sold the brand now to someone else, because  when we had to call and say, will you give us permission to do the jump to hyperspace  or whatever the hell we had to ask him, um, he said, oh, you'll have to ask Jim Hagedor.  Oh, somebody else owns that now?  Yeah, so he doesn't have to deal with me anymore.  Oh, great.  Were you calling him a lot?  Yeah, plaguing him with, pelting him with calls.  No, not at all.  I saw with the trailer thing that, uh, Sam was just showing, there's the Star Wars lettering 
[02:29:00]  and, you know, special presentation.  Well, yeah, so they got that from him.  So did you have to, uh, ask, yeah.  I had to, yeah, sleep with him in order to get to know him.  But I just mean literally sleep.  Yes, yeah.  Because at my age, you're tired.  Well, sleep me.  Speaking of the likeness, everything came out with your likeness, and you came out.  And that's annoying.  Yeah.  I mean, in a good way.  I like having the stuff around.  The shampoo bottle twist off my head.  That is a little odd.  And pour liquid out of my neck. 
[02:29:30]  They, and George actually gave me, there was this, another one that came out, this, this one  that's seated.  You see it in the show.  And I was at one of those comic book conventions because I'd been lonely and, you know, I wanted  to hang out.  Meet some cool guys.  Exactly.  Cool guys.  They really appreciate me for what I am.  What, or who.  And I, there was this thing on a turnstile, and it turned around, and you could really see 
[02:30:00]  directly up the dress of the doll to the lagoon of mystery.  Yeah.  Really?  And it had a, and I, I went, I went, well, I mean, it's not like with a V account and  everything, but, you know, it was too close for comfort.  Yeah.  And I, so I went and got my daughter, because, you know, you want to make her proud.  And I was like, come here, you have to see this.  By that time, they'd stop the turnstile.  So I did call George then and say, you know, owning my likeness doesn't include, but so he 
[02:30:30]  sent me one of those dolls where you could take the top off.  So I have my own Princess Leia doll with oreolas, everything.  Amazing.  That was one of my favorite parts of the show is when you go, thank God there's not a fuck  doll.  And the doll starts to, that was hilarious.  Yeah, really.  That there was a sex doll with a fuck doll.  Literally, and it's an $800 doll that is cement. 
[02:31:00]  That's erotic, isn't it?  Very erotic, yes.  I could just hump its leg or something.  One other thing, I love that you don't take yourself seriously in the Star Wars movies we  all love, obviously, and your friends beat you up because of the accent.  You went in and out of the English accent, which I never even noticed until you pointed  that out.  That was just like the start, though, right?  Well, but you guys, you know, this would be, if you were, my favorite.  But our friends would be like, holy shit, you're in Star Wars, but you have friends  that have to beat you up about it. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  That's the difference, I'm thinking.  Your friends would beat you up about this.  Yeah, probably.  They would.  You're probably right.  You're probably right.  No, but it was also.  I smelled your foul stench when you came, when I came aboard.  I thought I recognized your foul stench.  And, but you know what?  The first film, the first thing I shot was the scene with Peter Cushing, right?  It was Governor Talkin'.  It was that first scene.  So I, I started to do it.  I came in and went, you know, it's literally, I wanted to do it like, hey, Governor Tarkin.  I got on board this ship and I thought, what the hell is that smell? 
[02:32:00]  It's gotta be Governor Tarkin.  So George takes me aside and says, this is really, really serious shit.  You're very serious.  You're very upset.  They're going to blow up your planet.  This is, I mean, really, like, so I had to do it straight.  So you say that line, Governor Tarkin.  I thought, I thought, I thought I recognized your foul stench when I arrived.  Governor Tarkin, I thought I recognized your foul stench when I came aboard. 
[02:32:30]  Okay, now say it without it.  Hey, Governor Tarkin, I thought I recognized your foul stench when I came aboard.  I probably, I couldn't.  See, I'm an actor, they're not actors.  Okay.  Jimmy, do it.  Governor Tarkin, I thought I recognized your foul stench when he came on board.  Yeah, exactly.  It makes you want to fuck with the dialogue.  Yeah, a little bit.  It really does.  A little bit.  Was there a, um, I've seen the movie a couple of times.  I'm a little familiar with it.  When you're in the cell and that door opens, and of course Luke is there in his little stormtrooper suit. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Is that what you're wearing, a little see-through?  Do we actually see a little...  Well, I don't wear anything underneath.  And she explains that, too.  At one point, the light hits it.  Yeah, I do talk about their...  I think we see a little nip through the top.  No, here's where to look for no bra.  Right at the end.  Here's where to look.  Just going to help out every nerd.  Every nerd.  This will make all the sights.  But at the end of the, when Luke comes back and R2's all blown up and he's been in his big fight, 
[02:33:30]  and I come underneath the thing, and I say, and I say it really badly, and it's horrible acting, and I hated saying this line at the time.  I knew you weren't in it for the money.  Okay, whatever leads up to that is bouncing, bouncing breasts.  And it looks really stupid.  It sounds stupid, but there you go.  That's the nerd shot right there.  If you want to look for bouncing Leia breasts. 
[02:34:00]  Can you tell the audience what Lucas said to you about...  There's no underwear in space.  But then, by the way, I used to have it if he explained it.  He said, when you go into space, you become weightless, right?  Okay, fine.  So far, so good.  But then your body expands, but your bra doesn't.  So, you get strangled by your bra.  Did he use this as a kid in school?  This was the logic.  George Lucas was a dirty boy. 
[02:34:30]  When I went back to him and said, you did say that to me.  Because they could build a Death Star, but they can't build a bra that stretches with your tits in space.  I always have been saying they should have had a Princess Leia planet.  You know, like, one of the planets, we could go get our hair done.  Right.  I mean, fuck, I can't put, you know, that hairstyle every morning.  Come on.  Very funny when you put that on, by the way, during the show.  You put on the hair wig and just kind of...  It's flattering, isn't it?  Yes, but you have a great sense of humor about it.  Like, a lot of people take their roles too seriously. 
[02:35:00]  And you're like, eh, you fuck with it and have fun with it.  But how could you take Princess Leia thing?  I know the Danish as they call them.  It was fun to do, and we had a really good time doing the movie.  And it was, I was a girl in an all-male fantasy.  I mean, and I was a kid.  What's the question you get the most, as far as Star Wars goes?  Did you know it was going to be that big of a hit?  Yeah, thank God.  Yeah, I did.  I had a crystal ball, and I used to sit around.  You knew sequels were coming.  You knew years later there'd be prequels, everything.  I knew that I could see the merchandising. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I'm psychic.  How, what's the worst?  Because I know fans probably ask you, you're one of those iconic figures.  Sign, sign.  What's the most annoying place someone has fucking stuck something on your face?  Well, people have asked me to sign their flesh so they can have it tattooed.  Wow.  That's hardcore.  So that's happened a lot.  That just happened in Australia again.  Did you do it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm so dumb, but I mean, it's like, my thing is like, what?  You should write it really big. 
[02:36:00]  Carrie, feelings on the Star Wars Christmas special?  It's the worst thing ever made.  Is it not the worst thing ever made?  But wait, it's so bad, it's not even good.  No, no.  Listen, I actually did a favor for George, because I couldn't get it.  Yeah.  I said, I will do the voiceover on this, you know, thing, on some Star Wars thing, if  you get me the Christmas special, because I think he like took them off the market.  Oh, he pretty much like went out single-handedly, punched people in the face and took it back. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, come on.  Art Carney in the Death Star?  Are you kidding?  It was great.  Come on.  Hey, how about the author as the bartender?  Wait, come on.  Wookiee Life Day, okay?  Where they just spoke Wookiee for the first ten minutes of this thing.  You couldn't understand a word.  There wasn't subtitles.  I got it, though.  He gave it to me.  I gave a party so that we could watch it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's the best.  And it's not funny.  No, there's not.  I mean, it's so bad.  Okay, it's funny for a second.  Although Jefferson Starship singing in the little thing was fantastic. 
[02:37:00]  Awful.  Well, it's just, it's so bad.  I got it at one of those Comic-Con things.  Well, that shows you he did not know it was going to be a hit.  Yes.  No one in their right mind would have tainted the movie itself with that jerk.  That's right.  That's all garbage.  I thought Han Solo was good, though, when he goes, I mean, Harrison said, like, yeah,  he saved my skin more than a few times.  I thought there was some good, powerful lines in there.  And we'll keep it in the, whatchamacallit?  Yes, it's very funny.  Well, and I sang that song.  Yes, you did.  Now, there was a rumor you would have had maybe imbibed a little alcohol beforehand or maybe 
[02:37:30]  some drugs before that.  There's always going to be those rumors, though, that I just was constantly staggering around.  Mostly, I left my drug use for the weekend and after the shoot.  Because the dialogue, you can't say sober.  So, I'm going to, what, get loaded, you know, freeze up my mouth.  How's the party in these days?  It's, I've used my coupon.  We're out.  I'm, you know.  You're done. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I mean, as far as I can tell.  Do you miss it?  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Absolutely.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  You said it's a bit fun.  Oh, it is.  Sometimes, but then it kind of starts being fun.  Yeah, no, you start getting too many of those things where you think, I'm going to die.  If I, if you let me live through this, I won't do it anymore.  That was cocaine, by the way.  You think Carrie Fisher thinks that?  I did that about eight, nine times before it really went okay.  Yeah, back in the 80s with cocaine was that. 
[02:38:30]  You don't want to.  It was like, I don't want to get.  I think I'm going to die.  I think I'm really going to die here.  Right, my heartbeat is.  Yeah, yeah, it's going to pop out of my chest.  Please let me live.  If you let me, I promise to.  Yeah, I, if you let me live to just do some more coke, I swear.  No, and I did not, that's not a drug I really liked, so.  No?  You liked a little more of the mellow stuff?  No, but the thing was, I liked painkillers.  Painkillers?  Wow.  But the, and hallucinogens.  Oh, really?  Hallucinogens?  Mind expanders and painkillers. 
[02:39:00]  A little mescaline?  Worked the other way.  LSD.  Yeah, so you went right for the LSD.  Wow.  Yeah.  How did you, like, what age were you when you first started?  LSD?  I was in my 20s.  20s?  Yeah.  What about, like, the simplest thing, like a first drink or first joint or something like  that?  How old were you?  First joint, all of that was about 13 years old.  About 13?  Yeah.  And what, did you have the kind of lifestyle where you weren't really being supervised?  Was that kind of a thing?  Yeah.  Look who her parents were.  Oh, no, I know.  My father shot speed for 13 years, and he wasn't anywhere near, he wasn't around at all. 
[02:39:30]  And, you know, my mom worked all the time, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, and we should get into that.  Eddie Fisher is your father.  Was.  Was.  Excuse me.  Sorry for your loss, by the way.  I am, too.  And Debbie Reynolds.  And Debbie Reynolds.  And Eddie Fisher leaves Debbie Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor.  And that lasted a couple weeks, right?  He pays for it for the rest of his life.  Oh, wow.  How long were they together?  Not long at all?  No, no.  Well, it was the same amount of time as my mother and him.  Four years.  Four years. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  I didn't even think it was that long.  She converted for him, for my dad.  That lives.  She went Jew.  Elizabeth Taylor went Jew, yes.  Wow.  Isn't that awesome?  It's awesome.  But the show is so much more than just, there's like a little piece on Star Wars in it, but  it was so much more interesting.  That's why I'm getting into.  The family stuff.  It was really fucking amazing.  That's why I get into this family thing.  Yeah, would you punch Elizabeth Taylor in the face if you could?  No.  If you saw her walking down the hall right now?  I let her push me in the pool.  Did you?  Mm-hmm.  Basically, to show her, you can't hurt me now. 
[02:40:30]  No, but I, she did.  Liz Taylor, I thought I smelt your foul stench.  Yeah.  No, she pushed me in the pool, and it was, my, then my daughter thought she could do it  all the time.  She broke up the family, though.  I once gave her an award and thanked her for getting Eddie Fisher out of our house.  But, you know, I mean.  That's why you gotta watch this show on Sunday, I'm telling you.  It wasn't gonna, I don't think the marriage would have lasted anyway, and if it wasn't Elizabeth 
[02:41:00]  Taylor, it would have been somebody else, my parents were not a good match, but, you  know, they made him into a villain, and, you know, he contributed, he just kept doing  shit like that, so, you know.  Yeah, and he loved the Asians.  Well, he, yeah.  He loved the Asian women.  Yeah, by the, by the end there, that, that became his, um.  Just showing you, I watched this thing.  I didn't, I didn't want to lie to you.  Did, uh, did your parents, I know your, your dad passed away, like, three months after  this was shot.  Did you, did your parents both saw it, and did they like it? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, they were in it.  They, if they came to the show, they'd get on stage, they'd sing, they'd do.  Yeah, because how long did you do it on the, on the stage before they, HBO came to you?  Years.  It was years.  Yeah, I did it in L.A., and then I did it around, I did it up in San Francisco, where  my father lived, and, uh, so I was there for months, and then just in a lot of cities  in, in America.  I loved how you ended the thing, and I, I won't give that away. 
[02:42:00]  Your out was, it was very funny, yeah, it was very funny.  The way, the way you left, it was, I don't even want to give that away.  It was just very good.  So I don't want to give too much of this away.  Now, did you, uh, growing up in a show business family, uh, did you want to get into  it?  Did you have a need?  So, now you didn't want to, and how did you end up getting?  Because the bigger trick would have been, you know, I didn't go into it, I just kind  of stupidly stayed.  There's something very passive about, you know.  You didn't want to be a little song and dance girl or anything like that?  No, I watched, first, it was what my parents did. 
[02:42:30]  Also, it was kind of uncool?  It was definitely uncool, yes.  Vegas, for a teenager, and Reno.  Especially then, was like, just...  No, and, and that was actually, in my family, that's really, was the rebellion, not the  drugs, not doing my own nightclub act.  Now, you don't mean the rebellion, you know.  The Star Wars Rebellion?  Okay, I get confused when you talk sometimes like that.  No, who doesn't?  No, but I didn't go, I watched my parents' careers just, you know, kind of fade, and I 
[02:43:00]  watched how painful that was for them, and they scrambled to try to get back, because  there is no point in, in a career in show business where you just go, well, here I am  at this point, now I'm just going to kick back and relax.  You've got to scramble to get there, and then once you're there, you have to scramble to  stay, and there's no way to stay forever, you have to, what?  And then, so we watch the pictures as people then become my age, and you get older and fatter 
[02:43:30]  and whatever it is, and it's a humiliating...  Isn't it almost a better to have loved and lost thing, though?  So it's like, well, you were there.  Oh, I'm not suggesting, yeah.  You were there.  But I'm just saying, it's so not simple.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, I would rather have been in show, I would rather have done the writing, and yes,  I like show business, like writing films, or...  A little more behind the scenes, a little more your own artistic...  Yeah, because I just did the thing in front, and it just gets... 
[02:44:00]  But then how did you get Princess Leia?  Yeah.  With that type of love.  I was brought...  With that lousy attitude.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's sort of what I was getting at.  Well, no, I...  Like, really didn't want to go into that business.  That screwed me, too.  Because that screwed you for the rest of your life, if that's how you really think.  No, it was the second film I did.  The first film I did, I went with a friend of mine, George Firth.  He brought me on the set of Shampoo.  I met Warren Beatty.  He said, okay...  I want to have sex with you.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, here's the part.  I shot one day, I was a virgin, and Warren told everyone in the crew, so if you watch 
[02:44:30]  that movie, I say, want to fuck in it.  They cut away from me so fast, because the entire crew laughed at me.  Anyway, so the next thing that happened was, they started, I don't even know, like six months  later, my mother's agent said, oh, they're doing, you know, readings for Carrie, the horror  film, and for this other film, this kind of science fiction thing, and no one gave a shit 
[02:45:00]  about that kind of stuff.  No.  And I went in, and I read for it, and I got it.  Jeez.  Oh, shit.  And then I was in.  But I read that script, and I would have done that script, anybody would have.  I mean, it was, I read it out loud with a friend of mine, Miguel Ferrer.  I wanted to, Han Solo was the part to play.  I love Miguel Ferrer, he's great.  Yeah, he was a friend of mine from, and so we read it out loud, and it was just like, 
[02:45:30]  and I do remember when I got the part, I was really excited.  Not because it was a good part, not, but because I couldn't figure out how the hell they were  going to make that thing happen.  Make it actually work.  Yeah, because there wasn't any real precedent before that.  No precedent.  No special effects, really.  But they had this stuff, it was written on the page.  I mean, there's a new show out about, that ILM and all those guys talk about when they  read it for the first time, and how many shots.  Shit, we're going to have to do this? 
[02:46:00]  Right.  And it hadn't been done.  And there was a thing, in the script, the original script, they found me, not in the,  you know, when they, aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?  I was unconscious in the, sort of, underneath the Death Star, wherever the fuck, hanging  upside down, unconscious, with yellow eyes.  Holy shit.  Well, I thought, well, I want in on that, you know?  Fucking 19 years old. 
[02:46:30]  And the Wookiee was then supposed to take me and carry me under the, underwater.  We were having, now, the guy that played the Wookiee, Peter Mayhew, had giant-itis.  He had no strength at all.  You know, and if he stood up really fast, he would, you know.  We met him.  Yeah.  We feel like we're growing as a radio show, because we only got the guys that were in  the costumes of Star Wars until today.  Oh, well.  The whole crew came in.  We had the short guy, the tall guy. 
[02:47:00]  When?  The guy in between.  Oh, years ago, yeah.  This was one of the anniversaries.  Yeah, they were promoting something.  They came out as a group.  Like, how about Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill and the rest of them?  Well, there you go.  It shouldn't be that hard to get any of us by this point.  Were you surprised seeing the movie after reading the script and then probably doing  a lot of stuff in front of blue screens at the time?  Yeah, so I was as surprised, you know.  So you're like, wow.  Were you thinking, like.  It was better than I thought it would be. 
[02:47:30]  I'm in front of a blue screen.  What the fuck is that?  Was that a new technology?  Well, blue screen was really boring.  Yeah, I would guess.  I would just sit there.  They actually, they did a funny thing, and I think it was in the last one.  I was reading, you know, while they lit on the speeders, you know, when we're going  through the forest.  Oh, shit.  So they had actually, you know, outtakes of me reading Colette as the speeder.  Racing through the woods. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  That was really good.  When they had a goodie reel.  Yeah.  Of the Star Wars.  I wonder if that exists anywhere.  People would love to see that.  Oh, man.  That was awesome.  They should put that out.  You know, outtakes.  Yeah, yeah.  That would do great.  Yeah.  No, there was some.  That would be great.  That's one thing I wish they did have.  What was the first.  Because you had this image of being this.  You know, you were Princess Leia.  And what was the first public indication that like, oh, things are there's there's something  not like what was your first public embarrassment or or however you want to say it or or fuck 
[02:48:30]  up or.  You mean.  That kind of got you in the tabloids.  And yeah, yeah, yeah.  But we're not a positive way.  People not fitting the mold of Princess Leia where everybody people are looking going,  wow, she's unraveling.  Like when Charlie Sheen first got busted with a hooker.  We're like, wow.  I wasn't ever busted.  I I wasn't really a spectacle till in my 20s.  They didn't find you naked in a bush somewhere. 
[02:49:00]  Not that I know.  I think you pretty much outed yourself as somebody that was kind of.  Well, I went into rehab at 28.  28.  OK.  So and really, I didn't really abuse everything until.  So it was like between 22 and 28 was when I.  Yeah.  You were hanging out with a pretty fast crowd there, weren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fast and dead.  John Belushi.  Yeah.  Dan Aykroyd.  Obviously.  Dead.  Well, that whole SNL. 
[02:49:30]  That scared the shit out of everybody.  We all were waiting to see what John died of, hoping it wasn't the drug we were on.  Oh, really?  Did you guys know that he was going to go too far?  Of course we knew you would.  You know, yes.  I mean, it was legendary even at the time when all that was going down.  Everyone was very concerned.  John, Danny used to call him the black hole in space, because if you put anything near  him, food, drugs, whatever.  Just suck it on.  Bye, gone. 
[02:50:00]  Holy jeez.  So, that was actually when we first, I first did LSD, was on the Blues Brothers set.  Wow, really?  And there were all these policemen around, and we thought they were extras.  They were the police.  And you're all fucked up.  Yes.  Very.  Oh, my God.  But John.  LSD on the set.  Wow.  And John just, he also, Danny called him America's guest, because he could just go up  to anyone's house and go, listen, can I use your TV? 
[02:50:30]  Because something's on, you know, he just.  Yeah, everybody's that guy.  Everybody.  One time he wanted to go with me to Disneyland.  I said, there is no fucking way that would be fun.  Because you are the Matterhorn.  But he actually, he was one of the first people I knew to have those, you know, drug guards,  sober coaches.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Wow.  And so, one time he had his sober coach.  I always thought the guy's name was Peaches.  And he comes over to see me.  I'm getting my hair dyed for some movie or permed or whatever. 
[02:51:00]  And he says to this sober coach, okay, you go now.  I'm with Fisher.  And I was terrified.  I said, please don't go.  Don't put this on me.  Right.  Because, of course, it did not end well.  I mean, I couldn't.  I was put in the position of being like, John, should you be drinking sake?  You know, it's just tea.  That's okay.  I mean, I knew enough.  I was about 23.  I knew enough at that point that that's not okay. 
[02:51:30]  You said the best thing about resentment, too.  You said it's you drink the poison.  It's when I drink the poison and hope the other person dies.  How did you put it?  Drink the poison and wait for the other person to die.  What a great statement about it.  Because, you know, I seethe with resentment.  And it was just such a great way to put what a shitty state of mind that is.  It really is bad.  I actually said to my mom recently, isn't self-pity awful?  She said, actually, I like it.  You know, you complain. 
[02:52:00]  It gives you something to do.  I think a lot of people like self-pity.  I know.  Wouldn't it be great if it was aerobic?  Right.  But, no.  So you were diagnosed with bipolar?  I was.  I was pretty early on.  At 24.  And the only reason I think it didn't happen before that was I didn't go to a psychiatrist.  But I had asked to go into therapy at 15.  Wow.  And no one in my family was in therapy. 
[02:52:30]  It was just the weirdest thing in the world to do.  So.  Why were you asking?  What felt?  Something just didn't feel right?  No.  No?  She goes, no.  No, it didn't feel so.  I felt like I was trying too hard.  You know, I wanted, you know, out of control, people pleasing.  You know, you want everyone to like you.  And if they don't, you're devastated.  That's not really an odd thing.  It was the intensity.  Oh, okay.  And also, I was getting crushes on gay men even then. 
[02:53:00]  Really?  They were the only people that were around that were male.  I was a chorus girl on Broadway in my mom's show.  Not many gay guys on Broadway, though.  Where'd you find them?  I managed.  She figured it out.  I figured it out.  And so then the doctors, the shrink said to me that I wanted to be a superwoman to.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  We're getting the signal we got around.  Yeah, you have other press.  We don't want to.  We wish we could talk to you for two hours.  You're great. 
[02:53:30]  We all love this thing.  It's going to be on HBO Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO, Wishful Drinking.  Wishful Drinking.  It was funny, man.  Hilarious.  She's obviously very, very funny and very, very honest with her life.  Well, thank you guys for having me on.  Not just the Star Wars thing.  I mean, it's her whole life.  I thought the family stuff was fascinating.  The whole thing, there was so many interesting parts, and the way you kind of goofed on Star  Wars and your part, and you had fun with it.  I loved it.  And it was, I'm telling you, that barefoot thing, I had never seen a performer do that  on a stage.  I got you.  It made a fetish.  We get it. 
[02:54:00]  I don't even like feet.  I typically boo feet.  I don't like them.  I have really nice feet, though.  I noticed that a lot.  I have awesome feet.  A lot.  Yeah, I freeze-framed out.  You know, whatever.  It was just my thing.  But I thought you were terrific, and I recommend it.  I'm good at playing me.  Yeah.  It's a stretch.  And it wasn't melodramatic.  There were poignant moments of it that felt very genuine.  But not like maudlin or anything.  It was not maudlin.  It wasn't like, insert, teardrop.  It was just very, very genuine.  Yeah, no.  I wouldn't have liked that. 
[02:54:30]  Pity me.  They showed it in L.A., and I was sort of there somewhere around.  I felt like I died.  You know what I mean?  Like it was a documentary.  I just watched one on HBO about Sergio DeMellon, you know, the guy that worked at the U.N.  that was killed.  So, you know, there are these other documentaries.  From dead people.  Yeah.  And we all actually just quietly just said nothing.  We're all dumb fuckers.  We did not know who that was.  The other guy.  Right, no.  But go and see who that is. 
[02:55:00]  He's like a perfect human.  And that's actually a really good documentary, too.  I watch a lot of those documentaries on HBO.  I like them, too.  Yeah.  Well, Carrie Fisher, phenomenal.  We love you.  Thank you guys for having me.  Sunday at 9 o'clock, I want to take a picture with Carrie Fisher.  Yay.  With your earphones on.  No, I'll take these off.  All right, we'll be back.  Take a break.  Opie, Anthony, I've been listening to you since day one.  I thought you were the greatest.  You find this funny?  You know, you're really rude.  And it's just that, folks, you know, like, I was offended. 
[02:55:30]  I was offended.  You find this funny?  Who touched you?  Get in touch with the Opie Anthony Show.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your questions or comments to feedback at OpieAndAnthony.com.  Just when you thought the show couldn't get any better,  we're waiting for a phone call from our friend Dana White.  Really?  Yeah, what do we got going on with UFC?  What is he promoting? 
[02:56:00]  I know what he's promoting, but for the audience, just in case, they don't know.  He's promoting that in 14 minutes...  That's right.  ...tickets for the January 15th Late Show,  the Anti-Social Network, go on sale.  Myself, Jim Brewer, David Tell, Bill Barr.  They go on sale for the Late Show Saturday.  And TheBorgata.com, it will probably sell out.  Yes, it will.  And that will be the last one.  It's going to be a great weekend.  So get your tickets at, what is it, in a few minutes? 
[02:56:30]  TheBorgata.com.  Yeah, actually, you can get your tickets at Opie Radio on Twitter.  No!  Yes, Opie will be buying tickets and handing them out.  I think that's fair.  I think that's fair.  I'll buy a few for some people and hand them out.  What the hell?  I can do that.  A couple things really fast.  Carrie Fisher was an amazing guest.  She was great.  I hope she comes back.  Wow.  And people are going, were you guys lying about the HBO thing?  No, I really enjoyed it.  You very enjoyed it.  I don't know if I would have searched it out on my own, to be completely honest with you.  Because I'm not a huge Star Wars guy. 
[02:57:00]  I love the movies.  I love the movies, but I think I've only seen them a couple times each.  That's about it.  What else?  Don't you like apple pie and children and puppies?  But I watched it because we were going to interview Carrie Fisher, and I really liked it.  I really enjoyed it.  Yeah.  So that's as honest as I could be with that.  Yeah.  Because sometimes we do have to lie.  We're stupid for letting you in on all the secrets, but someone on Twitter goes, do you  really like it, or were you just saying that because she was in the studio?  No, we really enjoyed it.  And the second thing, the Big A, E-Rock thing, I got to just say, wait till you see the video. 
[02:57:30]  Holy shit.  I was cracking up.  Jesus.  E-Rock's faces that he was making when he was dry heaving, trying to keep it together  as Big A was reading the news was just amazing.  Apparently, yeah, there was a little problem there with something as far as a fragrance  went.  Yeah.  And E-Rock couldn't take it, and he was, what do you mean?  Can we talk to Dana White, please?  Well, he was a little too close to the mic, and I think there was some residual stuff on 
[02:58:00]  the microphone.  Dana White.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, Dana.  First of all, I read your tweet yesterday, and I want to thank you personally, my friend,  basically calling us the best show on radio, and the only show you really enjoy doing,  or something like that.  I forgot the exact tweet, but it was very, very flattering.  I'm being honest.  Thank you.  And are you a Star Wars fan?  Because we just had Carrie Fisher in here.  Oh, that's pretty cool, yeah.  I wouldn't say that I'm some crazy fan or anything, but yeah, I grew up watching it.  We were discussing. 
[02:58:30]  She just left, and me and Jimmy are convinced that we could have sex with Carrie Fisher.  Yeah.  And we're thinking, would you?  Because, I mean, she's not the young Princess Leia anymore, but it's Carrie Fisher.  Yeah.  She would talk.  Mark Hamill jerked me off on the set of Corvette Summer, so I think I could have a shot with  her.  Would you have to do it just for the history kind of a thing?  Yeah, you know.  I would do it for the hotness.  What?  Really?  Yeah, it's my fetish.  Old, out of shape, brother.  Holy shit.  She would appreciate that. 
[02:59:00]  She would.  Yeah, every chick likes to be called old and fat.  Yeah, out of shape, he said.  Not fat.  Jesus, Jimmy.  You just really tagged that one nicely.  Yeah, he did tag it nice to make it even worse.  Hey, Dan, are you in New York?  No, he's in Montreal.  I read that, and then somebody said he was in New York.  Oh, are you in New York?  No, I'm in Montreal.  Okay.  Way to humiliate me.  Montreal.  I have this argument with people all the time.  Unfortunately, I haven't been to Vancouver, but my favorite Canadian city is Montreal,  because I haven't been to Vancouver yet.  I like Montreal over Toronto. 
[02:59:30]  Halifax is quaint.  Halifax?  Yes.  That Montreal is, I love it, though.  Do you find, I was there for the festival this year, and we were downtown, and there's  a kind of a creepy vibe in certain Montreal areas at night.  When you're there, you're creeping everyone out.  Why don't you stay in the hotel room, so we can all relax.  I don't know.  You guys have never been to Vancouver.  Vancouver is awesome.  I know.  I love Montreal, and I'm a big Toronto fan, too.  I actually was in Toronto all week.  Stayed there two days longer than I was supposed to. 
[03:00:00]  Well, the problem with Toronto, they dress like it's 1962.  I can't get over that.  You couldn't tell right now.  It was so cold when I was there.  Well, yeah, but they have a whole underground city in Toronto, which I think is pretty amazing.  You can live your whole life underground and have everything you could ever, ever need.  Except the sun.  Yeah, I know, but they figured it out.  It's a big one.  But they figured out how to live in a horrible, you know, climate that is Toronto.  Who are you?  St. Pierre Kosciak.  This is the rematch? 
[03:00:30]  Yes.  And this is, when is this airing?  Saturday.  Saturday night at 11 o'clock.  I can't see the monitor from there.  11 o'clock?  Oh, December 11th.  Okay.  And what time is it?  10 p.m.  10 p.m.  Jesus, is that small?  Either that or I'm fucking older than I have been.  Yeah, no, we, yeah, UFC 124, man.  St. Pierre is fighting again.  What is, did Kosciak's weight?  I mean, he had to come down and wait for this, didn't he?  No, no, no.  Kosciak's 170.  These guys, these guys fought back in 2007 and going into that fight, Kosciak was saying 
[03:01:00]  stuff, I forgot more about wrestling than this guy will ever know, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, he pretty much got out-wrestled by George St. Pierre.  This fight is coming off, these guys were both the coaches of season 12 of the Ultimate  Fighter, where, you know, Kosciak has tormented and busted his balls the entire season.  And I'll tell you what, man, it's the first time I've ever really seen George St. Pierre 
[03:01:30]  this pissed.  You know, he's a real nice guy and very easygoing.  We did the press conference up here yesterday.  Let me tell you what, man, these guys are ready to fight.  This is going to be a fun one.  Do you think that a lot of that was, like, because Ali would always say that whenever  he would kind of shit talk or do all that stuff, part of it was building the fight.  And a part of it was, you know, and Frazier's like, no, that went beyond building the fight.  What do you think of this?  Was this just promotion or was there more to it?  No, it's the same thing.  Listen, the thing is about Josh Kosciak, you know, every time this guy fights, he gets 
[03:02:00]  booed.  People don't like him, you know, and everybody talks about him, you know, being the bad guy  and playing the bad guy.  Josh Kosciak's a dick.  This guy's just one of those guys that, you know, is a dick that just, you know, when you're  around him, you're just like, oh, my God, this guy.  Well, you know, he's in the fight business and he's been doing that.  He's been doing some pretty shitty stuff to George St. Pierre for 13 weeks on TV.  Disrespecting him.  And, you know, you got this guy disrespecting you on TV and you kick this guy's ass once 
[03:02:30]  already.  St. Pierre's fired up, man.  I'm telling you.  I've never seen him like this.  So you want St. Pierre to win?  I guess it's not.  I guess you don't want to go on record, but it's obvious.  Whoever wins, wins.  Here's the thing with Kosciak, and people have asked me this.  You know, going into the season, and me and Kosciak, we, you know, we weren't getting  along at all, but I actually, Kosciak and I have become closer since the show. 
[03:03:00]  So it's just that he is who he is.  And like I said, he's not a bad guy.  Just one of those guys.  Dude, don't tell me you guys have never hung around with some guy who was just a dick.  We work with them.  All right.  I'm working on it.  Jesus, give me some credit.  Holy shit.  All right.  I'm in the room.  But yeah, you're right.  There are guys that like that.  You just accept that about them.  It's all right.  Well, that's who the guy.  In this game, too, where they're all kind of alpha males, the odds of it happening among  athletes on this level are probably a little bit higher anyway. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I got it.  You're probably sick of talking about it, but I got it.  Because I don't think we asked you personally.  Brock Lesnar, what was that with The Undertaker?  What was that all about?  Yeah.  Actually, I haven't had an answer to this question for a long time, but now I do.  Oh, you do?  I talked to The Undertaker the other day.  And his thing was, apparently, him and Brock have some type of beef, and it just so happened  Brock walked by him.  And Brock's wife was sitting over on that side of the octagon, and he was walking over to 
[03:04:00]  get his wife, but she had already been taken backstage.  And, you know, that's how it all went down.  Do you know what the beef was, though?  I don't.  You do, but you don't want to say it.  That's fine.  He's a good guy.  The Undertaker comes to a lot of different events that we've had, and he's a real good  guy.  He called me the other day, and Vince is a good guy, too.  Vince has always been stand-up with me. 
[03:04:30]  And, you know.  Wow, because we were trying to figure it out, so it was a real beef.  We weren't sure if they were setting up something for maybe a wrestling thing, but then we're  like, Dana's not going to allow that.  Yeah, and Brock wouldn't do that.  And why would Brock go backwards at this point?  Yeah.  Right.  That seems kind of shit.  You know what?  That really annoys me, though, because Brock just lost a heavyweight championship, and  for a guy to say anything to him, it just doesn't make any sense to me, how you fucking 
[03:05:00]  say something shitty to a guy who just lost a championship fight.  He got caught up in a moment.  Because he doesn't like him.  You know what I mean?  When you don't like somebody, what better time to say it to him right after he loses.  Yeah, that's a very good point.  And we had Cain Velasquez in the studio after he won, and what a great guy.  What a nice guy.  He really is a good guy.  He really, really is.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he and I had a little beef, but we worked it out with him.  I don't know if you're...  Fucking bitch choking me.  I don't know if the videos make it to you, Dana, but every time one of your guys comes  in here, Jimmy allows him to put him in some kind of death hole. 
[03:05:30]  I don't know what's wrong with Jim Norton, but Velasquez, what did he do to you?  I forgot.  I think it was the guillotine.  Yeah, the guillotine.  Jimmy took a guillotine on our show and tapped out within an eighth of a second.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  Guillotine's hurt.  I always find that these guys...  And it's not a masculine challenge at all.  It literally is just to experience what it is these guys experience in the ring on a millionth  of a level.  That's bullshit, though.  You would never know.  Yeah, Jimmy fucks with every big guy that comes in there, man. 
[03:06:00]  You know what I mean?  Jesse Ventura, all the UFC fighters.  With Jesse, it was a real aggression.  We didn't like each other.  I love these guys, and I set it up very nicely.  So I'm like, look, I'm just curious.  Show me gently.  By curious.  Not by curious.  When are you going to take a punch?  Never.  You ever see that video, Dana, of Chuck punching the guy in the arm?  Yeah.  He hits Ellis in the arm, yeah.  Like, that's challenging. 
[03:06:30]  And he had Fedor kick him in the leg, Jason Ellis.  It was like, that's the type of shit I wouldn't do.  Jason Ellis is the real deal, to take a kick from Fedor.  Oh, no doubt, man.  And I didn't know he took a punch from Liddell, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if it was Jason Ellis, but somebody took a punch from Liddell.  I have to say Jason Ellis.  And that was like they were doing some live event somewhere, right?  Yeah, it was on his radio show.  Unbelievable.  Hey, who else is on this card?  I always say his name wrong.  Alvitz?  Yeah.  And how is he?  Because he had to drop out of a fight.  He's good.  Tiago Alvitz is good. 
[03:07:00]  He's in great shape here, and his weight is right on.  He'll weigh 170 pounds, and he's fighting John Howard.  I'm predicting.  Usually, normally, when people ask me what the fight of the night is,  I usually have a pick, and it's not the main event.  And I actually think the main event might be the fight of the night for this one,  but Tiago Alvitz Howard is the fight that many people are predicting will be fight of the night.  Yeah, that's awesome, man.  Yeah.  How well received is this up in Montreal?  It's unbelievable, right?  Oh, yeah.  First of all, this weekend's fight, we broke the North American attendance record. 
[03:07:30]  Over 23,000 people will be there in the building.  Wow.  That's the biggest attended fight in North America,  and it broke the worldwide gate for mixed martial arts at, like, 5.5 million.  I'm so happy it's not in New York, because that money,  I mean, thank God that we don't have that kind of revenue coming in here in New York City,  because that would just, why would you need that?  I mean, I'd rather pay through my taxes.  Dana's working on that, and whatever.  You know what else?  Every hotel up here is sold out.  All the restaurants are packed, the malls. 
[03:08:00]  I mean, it's just, you're 100% right.  I like, you like to brag, don't you, Dana?  I'm just saying, Jim.  I'm just fucking with you.  Why not have all these people down in New York City right now spend money?  Dude, I'm just fucking with you, Dana.  Guess what?  The economy doesn't suck up here in Canada.  We're very happy for you.  I'm just breaking your ball.  Has it gotten any better, though, in New York?  Has it any closer?  We're getting there.  I mean, you know, I'll tell you what.  I honestly thought we were going to get New York done before Toronto, 
[03:08:30]  and we got Toronto done, so we'll get New York done, too.  Good.  But it is moving, at least, in the right direction.  I hope so.  It's embarrassing for, like, as a New Yorker, it's embarrassing.  Is Boston done?  I forgot.  Oh, yeah.  They did Boston.  They did Boston.  Oh, wow.  Man, you guys, every one of you guys got fucking amnesia today, man.  We're just idiots.  Know why, Dana?  It's time to come on at one in the morning.  I know.  Well, I'm an older gentleman now.  It's Friday, and we just did drugs with Carrie Fisher, so we're a little... 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  You're always organized and everything.  You run a big business.  We're just idiots on the radio.  I'm struggling with sleep apnea.  I don't think well in the morning.  I'm fucking...  I'm trying to look at the thing, and Sam's popping up on the screen, and I can't read it.  Dude, I didn't even know that Ultimate Fighter 12 season was on until it was, like, halfway over.  I had no idea it was even on.  I just fucking...  Nobody tells me anything.  Jimmy needs people to tell him stuff. 
[03:09:30]  I really do.  And, oh, hold on.  Now!  Get tickets now!  Oh, there you go.  It's about...  Call Jim Norton making it about himself.  Get tickets now for the Borgata!  Sorry.  I'm whoring tickets that are on sale.  Jimmy's got two sold-out shows added a third.  That's pretty amazing.  That's with other guys, though.  It's not just me.  I have to be very honest.  You're the headliner.  Well, no, I'm not.  He's like you, too.  What's that?  He said you're like you, too.  Exactly.  Except for all the talent and fan base.  Exactly.  I'm like Bono, where I annoy people with my opinions.  That's about as far as I go. 
[03:10:00]  I still don't know what the fucking Joshua Tree is.  We get it.  It's nice.  Now, UFC 124, we know.  Saturday night, 10 o'clock.  Dana calls in because he likes us.  You don't need us to promote this.  It's sold out.  It's obviously going to be a huge...  By the way, did I tell you?  I watched one of the events on my fucking computer,  and it's great the way you guys have the streaming.  It's really amazing in casinos where they don't show the fights.  Yeah, thanks.  No, it's one of the things that's been fantastic for us.  Obviously, as technology continues to grow,  we just have so much more distribution, 
[03:10:30]  and we can get it to so many more people that couldn't...  Not everybody has cable.  Not everybody can afford pay-per-view.  There's so many different people.  You can watch it in movie theaters now.  There's so many different ways to watch it.  You're obviously happy with where the UFC is right now,  but what's the next step?  What do you guys want to do now?  Are there more countries you want to get into besides New York?  What else do you want to do with the company?  You know we've been going global  and going to all these different countries,  and we just opened an office now in China.  Jesus. 
[03:11:00]  Within the next couple of months,  we'll be in over a billion homes worldwide.  Right now, we're in half a billion homes.  We're opening up to India and China right now,  and we'll be in over a billion homes.  Do you make money off that, Dana?  A billion homes?  A couple of dollars?  Do you make a few bucks off that?  Have you ever been to China?  To be honest with you,  a couple of these markets that we go internationally,  we actually lose money,  but we're looking at it.  When we bought this company,  our goal was to build a sport, 
[03:11:30]  and to build a sport means everybody all over the world  is playing by the same rules.  So sometimes you've got to spend some money  to go into these markets,  but that's what we do.  Have you been to China?  No, my partner Lorenzo was in China.  What does he say about it?  He said it was awesome.  He said it's incredible.  You know, this last year,  I spoke at Bill Gates' house.  He has that CEO summit every year.  Wow.  And he calls in,  you know,  brings in 250 of the world's top CEOs. 
[03:12:00]  And the theme for this thing was,  America is yesterday,  China is now.  It's crazy over there.  Crazy.  The amount of money  and what's happening over in China  is actually pretty scary.  Chinese are coming.  How could we capitalize on that?  Dana, I've got to ask you  about Bill Gates' house.  Yeah, it was awesome.  I read an article  about all the crazy stuff  that's in that house  where you can control  your own climate  and your area and stuff.  Did you see any of that stuff? 
[03:12:30]  Air conditioning.  No, no,  but this is like you get a...  I don't know how...  It's an Afghan.  This magical portable blanket  you can place over yourself.  I don't know how it works now.  You give Snuggies to everybody.  But supposedly you get  some kind of like app type of thing  and then everything adjusts.  Everything adjusts  to your personal thing.  Your personal taste.  A little thing on you.  What was the craziest thing  you saw in his house  as far as technology  or whatever goes?  It was huge.  It's really, you know,  you have to take a boat over there. 
[03:13:00]  It's on an island.  You take the boat over there  and yeah,  it's a beautiful house.  When we got there,  everybody was pretty much in wonder.  It's not like we're all  wandering around the house.  Just walking around  stealing stuff.  Stealing stuff.  Very cool.  Yeah, just taking things  like Rupert Pupkin  over Jerry's house.  Is he a,  this is why you're successful  and I'm not.  I would have dropped  a deuce in the bowl  and left it.  An upper decker.  Yeah, I would have dropped  a fucking upper decker  at Bill Gates' house  and then Twittered it.  That's why we're not doing it. 
[03:13:30]  And you'd never get back there.  You'll never go.  Is he a UFC fan?  You know,  I don't know if  he's a UFC fan,  but when I spoke  at the summit,  but I think I introduced  a lot of those guys  to what the UFC is  and what our plans are  over the next 10 years.  Do you know nobody,  it's funny,  I talk about my friend,  he's my age,  he's got like a son  who's 17,  and I'm like,  he's like all he wants to do,  because my friend  doesn't watch UFC,  but he's like all this kid  wants to do is go to a UFC fight.  Like nobody  under fucking 20 or 15 
[03:14:00]  is really watching  much boxing  or anything anymore.  It's like UFC is the one  that everybody's watching.  Grab that whole audience,  Dana,  grab that entire audience.  Yeah,  I think what's happening too  is think about  when we were growing up,  guys.  When we were growing up,  your parents would put you  in either karate  or taekwondo  or something.  Mixed martial arts  is the new martial art,  and a lot of these kids  these days are growing up  training in it,  and this is fortunately  the sport that all  these younger guys like.  And you were smart too  because you hooked up  with the military,  and that is certainly 
[03:14:30]  your core audience,  and I know you did it  for patriotic reasons as well,  but it's still a great place  to be showcasing your product  with the military.  Because those are the guys  that are going to watch it.  Well,  one of the things  that's happened is  we translate very well  with the military,  police officers,  firefighters.  I mean,  everywhere we go,  no matter what city  we're in,  the police,  I mean,  when you fly in here,  the border patrol guys here,  I mean,  everybody is,  those are the type of guys  that really flock  to the UFC.  Now,  in the Middle East  and Mexico,  I mean, 
[03:15:00]  you kind of broke  through there.  Is it popular now  in the Middle East?  You guys went over there,  you did do a fight.  Is there something  you're going to go back  and do?  Is it grabbed,  I guess?  I don't know what the terminology is,  but you know what I mean.  Yeah,  no,  yeah,  definitely.  The crazy thing  about Abu Dhabi is,  you know,  the guys that run that country  are very young guys,  very hip,  and let me tell you what,  if you go to school  in Abu Dhabi,  you have to take jiu-jitsu.  Jiu-jitsu is like  a math or science.  You have to take it. 
[03:15:30]  So they do that  with the kids  from the time  they're in kindergarten.  So,  yeah,  it's big in the Middle East,  though.  What are we doing  in this country?  What are we doing?  How about,  Kane,  are you going to have him  defend in Mexico?  No,  I don't think he'll defend  in Mexico,  but,  you know,  Mexico's a very important market.  Just think about this.  We bought this thing.  For me,  the three no-brainers  were Mexico,  the United States,  and the UK,  traditionally very big  boxing countries.  So,  those, 
[03:16:00]  I never saw Canada come.  I didn't think Canada  was going to be,  you know,  as big as it is.  Is that the biggest surprise  you think,  the fact that Canada is,  because baseball,  they just out and out  really rejected.  So,  would you say that this is,  was that the biggest  surprise for you?  Absolutely.  No doubt about it.  And to be as big  as it is here.  That's awesome.  I mean,  last night,  we were out last night,  you know,  they have a casino up here.  So,  we were up at this casino  last night,  and they got TVs  everywhere in there.  And it's all that was playing 
[03:16:30]  on television last night  was just,  it was crazy.  They love it up here.  Casino in Canada?  It's literally like,  that's amazing.  Casino-like.  It's probably the same  as a casino here.  You walk in,  you get your ass fucked,  and you go home.  Sound it?  Same as,  same as every casino  in the States.  They bleed you.  Actually,  normally when you go  to the different casinos,  that are not what you expect  when you come from Vegas,  I was actually surprised  at how Vegas-like  this casino is.  Yeah,  they do a good job.  I'd be throwing toonies  at the dealer's head.  Just fucking throwing  toonies at them  with their dumb money. 
[03:17:00]  There's hockey players  on their money.  How smart could they be?  Why are you insulting Canada?  Dana's on the phone.  He's in Montreal.  He's on the phone.  He's in Canada,  but he's not a Canadian.  Are you Canadian?  No.  Jesus Christ,  good.  It's from Boston.  It's all about America,  my friend.  He's a hardcore Boston guy.  It's all about America.  Hey,  good,  I'm glad they like the sport,  but for the love of God,  let's,  you know,  get the hockey players  off your money.  Huge audience in Canada  ourselves.  They love us in Canada.  What kind of money is that?  We don't have a huge audience  in Canada.  I can't get a gig up there.  It's fucking humiliating.  Oh yeah,  good point.  I'm like the comedy cuckold.  I have to watch my friends  go out and do great gigs 
[03:17:30]  in Canada.  Have you decided  who Kane's going to fight?  Velasquez?  Yeah,  he's fighting Dos Santos.  Did we know that?  Yeah.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  Okay,  what UFC event  is that going to be?  We don't know yet.  We're not sure.  A little further down the road.  But that's a great fight.  Yes.  Were you honestly,  I mean,  you're pretty honest about  were you surprised  that that fight  ended in the first round?  No,  I wasn't surprised  that it ended  but I was surprised  at how fast  and how,  yeah,  I knew somebody  was getting knocked out 
[03:18:00]  in that fight.  There's no way  that fight  was going to go five rounds  with those two seats.  I could not believe  how fucking  he pushed Lesnar off him.  I could not believe  how strong  Velasquez was.  I mean,  I had a feeling  he was going to lose  and I thought  he was going to lose badly.  But everybody,  I picked,  by the way,  I'm wrong.  I'm a hundred percent wrong.  Yeah,  you really are horrible  at picking.  Nobody,  I really,  I'm the fucking,  I'm the ace  but the wrong way.  Who was it?  Who was it?  The fucking De Niro  playing casino?  Yeah,  ace. 
[03:18:30]  What was ace?  I couldn't remember  his last name.  Ace,  whatever his fucking name is.  Well,  all right,  well,  the UFC,  it is a...  Rothstein.  Yes,  this,  I hate the fact  that Sam got a man  reference before I did.  I know.  This,  the fight is this Saturday,  eight o'clock.  It's UFC 124.  And I can't believe  I got that wrong.  Koshtek and fucking  St. Pierre is the main event.  We'll be more prepared  next time,  Dana.  10 o'clock on pay-per-view  on the East Coast.  At 10 o'clock,  was I off by two hours?  You were.  I really am a fucking 
[03:19:00]  bag of jizz.  A bag of jizz.  It is Friday,  though.  He'll give us some slack.  Doesn't matter what day it is.  I got it.  I was off by two hours.  But before,  I was off by fucking  three hours.  Is it one in the morning?  Is that when you're  doing your event?  I really am stupid.  All right,  so who's fighting?  You have Ali Frazier.  Ken Norton is fighting.  I really should be fucking  mouthfucked with a stick.  I'm sorry.  I'm just so excited  that I'm whoring  my own tickets.  All right,  I guess,  are we,  is the show over?  We're finished.  Yeah, 
[03:19:30]  we are.  We fucking stumble  to the finish line  like the lady  in the wheelchair  that runs the marathon  every year  and clogs up traffic.  Dana,  fuck it.  Next time,  note to self,  call us at 730.  Yeah,  a little earlier.  We're a little fresher  at 730.  Yeah,  this time on a Friday,  very difficult  to hold our attention.  I think it was entertaining  and we did get some plugs out,  but it was kind of,  it was a sloppy one  this time around.  This Saturday night,  our apologies  for being so unprepared.  Don't forget,  Jimmy Norton  at the Borgata.  There you go. 
[03:20:00]  Damn.  Thank you very much.  Third and final show.  Hopefully sold out already  at 10 minutes in.  You know how I do.  Yeah,  I'm sure they're available.  All right,  when are you going to be back  in New York?  We'd like to,  I would like to see you again.  I'm not sure.  My travel schedule  has been so crazy,  but I should be back there  again in January.  So I'll hit you  and we'll hook up.  What do you eat  in Pinkberry?  I told you,  I Twittered that I thought  of you when I was  at Pinkberry.  I really did.  I told my girlfriend.  We already know.  Fruity Pebbles.  I don't remember.  See,  at least I remember  that much about them. 
[03:20:30]  Strawberries too.  The original  with the strawberries.  Gotta go original  no matter what.  Just stick with the original.  I go with the fruit,  the fresh fruit.  That little chocolate thing.  Sprinkle on top.  I said to my girlfriend  while we were eating  Pinkberry,  I'm like,  fucking Dana White  eats Pinkberry  all the time.  I could not have  gotten a bigger  who gives a shit stare  out of a chick.  We were trying  to make it more manly.  That's what you do.  Dana White can pull it off.  I don't think me  and Jimmy can.  Dude, 
[03:21:00]  there's no way  to make a chick interested  in that your fucking  friend eats  fucking the same  cold snack  you're having.  I literally  should have said,  you know,  I ate this once  and then fuck  my ex-girlfriend.  All right.  Dana,  you're great,  man,  and I'm happy  for obviously  how well things  are going for you.  All right,  he's just laughing  at us now.  All right,  good luck this weekend  and we'll see you soon,  buddy.  Take it easy, Dana.  All right.  Take care, man.  You know what?  Oh, God.  That was a disaster.  No, it was funny.  It was funny, though.  I was fucking hysterical.  This Saturday night, 
[03:21:30]  I just wasn't,  I didn't realize  he was calling it today.  The bigger who gives a shit.  It was very funny.  I really don't know  the card this time around.  I just don't.  I know Kostchek's APA  will be a great fight  and I have heard  those guys hate each other  and I've heard  that Kostchek's a dick.  I just didn't watch UFC  The Ultimate Fighter this year,  which was odd this season.  I normally would watch it.  You love that show.  Yeah, it's great  and I just fucking didn't know  it was on until it was halfway over.  I've got to go all in  with that show.  I look at it here and there  but I've got to go all in  and watch it from beginning to end.  I don't claim to be a UFC expert. 
[03:22:00]  I just love the sport.  Yeah.  I love it.  I love when you,  you know.  You just totally ran out of steam  on that thought.  I love how the,  that was my new bit.  When you were waiting,  weren't you?  Yes.  I tried out my new bit.  It works.  I want to know how to.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Ticket sales are going on.  All right,  Jimmy,  you're going to do very well.  Oh, absolutely.  Third show for Jimmy's Borgata show  with Jim Brewer,  David Tell,  and Bill Burr  went on sale  about 13 minutes ago.  Yeah,  it's 11 o'clock, 
[03:22:30]  January 15th,  the late show.  It's going to be a fucking,  I can guarantee  it's going to be a great show.  I very rarely will say that  but this is going to be  an amazing show  and sorry,  we just babbled.  Anthony,  what do you got over there?  I see you got something cool.  Well,  Opie,  you know something?  Shaving every day.  Oh my God.  Isn't it a drag?  It's a nightmare.  Like literally,  a drag  but it makes other things  in life possible  all like a job.  How about a significant other?  Things like that.  Good thing there's  the new fully loaded  Panasonic Multiflex Shaver. 
[03:23:00]  Yes,  it's the only four blade electric  with ultra sharp  nanotech blades.  I can attest to this people.  I can.  I use,  look at me right now.  I'm all grubby,  right?  Because I didn't use it.  I didn't use it  like yesterday.  So I'm grubby.  I'm not going to have  to pre-trim  and then use  an electric razor  to get it close.  I just take  my wonderful  Panasonic Multiflex Shaver  fully loaded  and run it over  my whiskers  and they're gone.  It even amazed me. 
[03:23:30]  What?  Yes.  You don't have to like  pre-shave.  You know what I did?  Because I was  electric.  I was bored.  Yeah.  I shaved my beard.  I used the word  shave in quotes  because I used  a tweezer  and pulled them out  individually  all weekend long.  Okay,  see,  that's something  you probably  don't want to do.  It's not comfortable.  I'll give you  it's probably close.  It was real close.  It's not comfortable.  But it took forever.  And you could probably  use it in the shower.  By the time I was done,  I had to start  all over again.  Yeah,  I wouldn't doubt it.  It sounds terrible. 
[03:24:00]  It sounds very painful.  I love  the new  fully loaded  Panasonic Multiflex Shaver.  We're remarkable  closeness.  And like I said,  you use it in the shower,  wet or dry,  with shaving cream,  without.  It was awarded,  the Panasonic Multiflex  awarded the  Best in Show  Grooming Award  from Men's Health Magazine.  See for yourself  how ultra sharp  blades in the fastest  motor means  such a better shave.  It's great.  Why don't you go  to this website  right now,  FullyLoadedShaver.com.  Come on.
