<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, focusing on Jerry Sandusky and Joe Paterno, utilizing highly offensive language.  Jimmy Norton, present in the studio, recounted a trip to Los Angeles, including seeing Jay Leno and Joan Rivers.  The conversation detoured into various tangents, including a bizarre story about botched silicone injections, Nicki Minaj's appearance, parenting styles and intimacy with children, and a caller, Mike, pointing out the disparity in bail amounts between a DUI/child endangerment bus driver and Sandusky.  Bobo, a regular caller, offered an inappropriate segment suggestion.  Eric Bogle's "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda" played during a musical interlude.  The hosts further discussed the scandal's fallout and student reactions.

The show continued with more offensive commentary on the Penn State scandal and a graphic hypothetical scenario about workplace sexual assault.  This transitioned into a nonsensical bit about phone types, followed by a segment mocking Canadian author Ian Halperin’s inability to name Canada’s capital.  A trailer for the fictional show "Butt Trek" played, filled with explicit humor.  The hosts then criticized Madonna’s leaked song and the Real Housewives franchise, using vulgar and misogynistic language to describe their appearances and speculate about their sexual lives.  They criticized Ashton Kutcher's Twitter handling of the Penn State scandal, Billy Crystal hosting the Oscars, Brett Ratner's dismissal, and Adam Sandler's "Jack and Jill," showing a juxtaposition of the trailer with a George C. Scott reaction clip.  The segment ended with further commentary on Nick Cannon and a promotion for Jim Norton's show.

The next segment focused on Artie Lange’s career and the discovery of Jesse Morris, a Johnny Cash sound-alike street musician in a San Francisco BART station.  Several clips of Morris's performance were played, followed by the revelation of his recent death at age 27 and the availability of his music online to benefit his memorial.  A caller imitating Mike Francesa made racially offensive remarks.  The hosts discussed a Nick Cannon radio show segment where he allegedly launched his co-host's dog (later revealed as a hoax) into the air with balloons, playing audio clips and discussing the controversy and Cannon’s apology.  A discussion of the Opie and Anthony stunt "bra-bombing" followed, along with continued discussion of the Nick Cannon incident, the Anti-Social Comedy Tour, and the Wounded Warrior Project.


A subsequent segment centered on the fallout from the Nick Cannon dog stunt, expressing anger towards their former boss, Don Belucas, for their past firing.  Profane insults were directed at various individuals.  The hosts discussed the public reaction, Sam's defense of the bit, an upcoming show, Anthony's new Xbox (leading to a discussion about an intern's efficiency and generous tip), the Occupy movement and a related death, the Johnny Cash sound-alike, and a running gag about a host’s dry mouth and teeth.  Extended comedic tangents involving bowel movements and farts, primarily featuring Jim Norton and studio staff, were present, concluding with the playing of a song by the recently deceased musician.


The final segment began with a discussion about bowel movements, sparked by someone laughing at their own feces.  The hosts and Eric Nagel, in the studio, discussed their pride in their bowel movements; Nagel denied taking photos.  The conversation shifted to Troy's sleep-deprived call screening experiences, followed by detailed discussions about the hosts' and guests' experiences with rub and tugs.  Eric Nagel, Roland, and Mars shared anecdotes, with descriptions of establishments, pricing, services, and tipping.  A caller discussed tipping etiquette in such establishments.  The segment ended with further discussion of rub and tugs, a brief mention of a previous guest's reaction to a previous discussion of transgender people, and a Trojan condom commercial.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony channel. 
[00:03:30]  XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the O.P.  It's the O.P.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show with O.P.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  I don't even like an R opening.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  He did a day open in.  It only said a day open in.  Stop it.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm with him with Shatner, god damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Hi there.  Morning.  Fucking Jimmy's back, Ronnie. 
[00:04:30]  I got here earlier from Los Angeles than I do when I wake up in New York.  I know.  It was a little weird.  Did you sleep on the plane?  No.  No.  Why would I?  Jimmy never sleeps on the plane.  Laid there.  Yeah.  Awake, listening.  I tried to sleep and then I couldn't, so I downloaded a bunch of Eric Boulder music.  I was loving that.  Eric Boulder?  Yeah.  He's an Irish folk singer.  I was listening to...  How did you discover him?  I was...  The Pogues...  I was flipping around the Pogues and I found this guy who sings a song called... 
[00:05:00]  And the band played...  And the band played Marching Matilda, I think it is.  Or Walting Matilda.  Okay.  And the band played Walting Matilda.  A song about an Australian war in 1915 and how people love fucking soldiers when they  come back fucked up, they don't love them.  It's basically the person's song.  Happy Veterans Day, by the way.  Is today Veterans Day?  Yes, it is.  Oh, fuck, man.  It's 11-11.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Nobody cares about fucking October 10th of last year.  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, that's right.  We had a 10-10-10.  And now we have an 11-11-11.  Next year, December 12th. 
[00:05:30]  And then we got a 12-12-12 next year.  Somebody tweeted something brilliant, though.  It's like...  Thank you.  Yeah, 11-11.  11-11-11.  It's like...  It's actually 11-11-2011.  Yes.  But don't let that 20 ruin your fun.  Yeah.  That's right.  Because technically, if it was the year 11-11, then it's 11s across the board.  And that happened once.  But they like conveniently...  Yeah, that happened in, you know, the year 11-11.  There's no record of it, but it did happen.  Yeah, I'm sure there was horrible stuff going on. 
[00:06:00]  Some fucking...  Someone was on the rack being stretched.  Someone reached the old age of 17.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone had their fucking...  Had leeches put on them.  Right.  But they had a blast with this 11-11-11.  Yeah.  Because that was real.  Jimmy's tormented today.  You're tormented.  No.  The Black Sabbath thing is tormented.  Oh, Sabbath...  Yeah, they're doing...  Let's get it out of the way so we can do a radio show.  In L.A.  You were just in L.A.  But I was literally...  I know where the Whiskey A Go-Go is.  I was right on the street from it. 
[00:06:30]  I drove by it yesterday, going to Leno.  As they were setting it up for today?  No, no, no.  They'll just walk in.  But Henry Rollins is hosting it.  They're doing a press conference to announce, I believe, a tour.  The original Sabbath lineup will be there.  And, of course, I know I could have gotten into it.  Yeah.  But I had to fly home...  To be here.  To work at the brokerage.  Yes.  I had to do it, though.  I couldn't not do my shows.  It's too unprofessional to cancel fucking two shows.  There are so many people on Long Island that want to go.  I've had some inquiries from a lot of people that are going. 
[00:07:00]  And I, myself, am going to tomorrow night.  But those people could have went to the AC shows.  You could have canceled the brokerage.  That's a long island.  You don't want to drive all the way out there.  That's okay.  To see Jimmy Norton, that's a short ride.  I didn't feel right canceling last minute.  I felt it was too self-satisfying.  And it's like, to do what?  I've already met them.  I've talked to all of them.  I'm going to just stand there and go, hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey, it's me again.  Hey, son.  You know.  You're playing. 
[00:07:30]  It's all I would have been able to.  If they said you can interview them, I would have canceled.  You think it'll ever get to a point where they start looking at you as a stalker?  No, because that guy again, man.  And they start scratching their head.  I know he's a comic.  And he's pretty famous in his own right.  And he's interviewed us.  But he shows up an awful lot.  Yeah.  That's why I was okay not going.  Okay.  A couple of them would recognize me.  That was the Leno thing.  I DVR'd.  It was good.  I just can't stay up late enough to see little Jimmy.  They were not a great comedy crowd.  Because they were all there for the band Il Devo. 
[00:08:00]  No idea.  I didn't either.  But they're fucking massive.  They've shown 25 million records.  Wow.  They're massive.  What genre are they in?  I don't know.  They're Italian.  They're like four young tenors.  Hey, yeah.  But they're like fucking.  And I can't believe young chicks like these guys.  But so the audience was really weird.  And I could see it during Jay's monologue.  I felt it when I walked out.  There was a polite applause.  But it wasn't like when you normally walk out.  And Whitney Cummings was after me.  She was the first guest. 
[00:08:30]  And when she walked out, I could see her go like, come on.  But like she felt it.  So it wasn't just me.  It was just a weird comedy crowd.  But that I got in a veiled dog fucking joke.  And it was good.  I was very happy.  Veiled dog fucking joke.  Yeah.  It's always nice when you get those in.  That's always considered a win.  Yeah.  My column.  And Jay gets a little excited because I think Jay's a little twisted.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he enjoys when Jimmy gets one in under the censors.  He never minds.  And then you're on the play with Joan Rivers on the way in? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I saw her when I got on.  She was sitting.  I was sitting on one side.  She was on the other.  And she literally fell asleep.  I was like, I would love to be her.  Because she was sitting there reading something.  And then she just nodded out.  And she slept the entire flight.  Just didn't move.  Or she didn't turn the light off.  It's the best.  I envy that so much.  Plans are like ambient to me.  I just can't.  I can't stay awake anymore.  That's amazing.  At any point, did you feel like she might be dead?  No.  Because, you know.  Just how.  Two fingers on her neck. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Just how she fell asleep with the lights still on.  Yeah.  She fucking.  That's why she's still going.  Because she gets proper sleep.  That's why.  I'll be dead before I'm 60.  Because I fucking don't.  Or I'll have dementia.  Because I don't sleep.  You don't sleep at all.  I don't sleep now.  I try.  I laid there.  My whole body's like.  Itch.  Itch.  Itch.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  It's what I feel.  That's the noise my body makes.  And then it itches?  Yeah.  A little itch.  Itch.  Itch.  Where are the itches?  Everywhere.  I get one under my nose.  Or in the bottom.  No.  In the fucking palm of my foot. 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  Where I have to fucking stomp like a fucking.  Like a donkey on the floor.  Itch it.  You ever stomp your foot to itch it?  Anything better than itching athlete's foot?  It really is good.  Oh.  It feels so good.  You guys don't know what you're missing.  Yeah.  Unfortunately I'll just itch to the point where I'll take a couple layers of skin off.  Oh.  God damn.  But you keep your socks on and you got that athlete's foot itch.  Oh my God.  To dig in and get at it.  I'm not even joking man.  It's a great feeling.  I like a little tough actin tenactin. 
[00:10:30]  Then I'll spray it down and get rid of the crap.  That helps.  Yeah.  A little tough actin tenactin.  But Joan Rivers took off.  You didn't even see her after the plane landed.  No.  Afterwards she was the first one to get off.  She has it down.  I think she was alone actually.  I thought she was within a system.  I think she was by herself.  And man she gets off and I saw her walk off.  I was walking up the jetway behind her.  And she's fucking got a brisk little walk.  And there was a woman from the airport who agreed her who met her.  And I think she gets right on her.  The one time I did actually meet her and get a picture.  She gave me a ride on her little cart. 
[00:11:00]  But I think that she had to walk in JFK because you've got to go down an escalator.  Walk up an escalator.  So she didn't get her cart right away.  She fucking.  I went to piss and I came out and she was probably 500 yards.  She was.  Jesus Christ.  She's in her 80s right?  You were telling me.  70s or 80s.  Yeah.  She's old.  I mean I might be mid 70s.  I shouldn't say she's in her 80s.  She's still doing it.  I do like that documentary.  It was great.  Yeah.  She's a fucking animal man.  I highly recommend you watch that if you're into comedy.  And she 78 and she looked good man. 
[00:11:30]  I know she's had a million different procedures done but she looked really good.  Now you gotta slow down.  Come on.  I saw her and she looked.  That plastic surgery looks good up close?  I.  She looked great.  I was surprised how good she looked.  Yeah.  I mean everybody knows.  She talks about it so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was surprised how you know from a few feet away I was like fuck man.  She has the good plastic surgery.  I was telling Anthony.  There's a story in the paper today about a lady that died because she was getting some kind  of injections into her thighs and ass.  Oh my god.  Yeah.  And the lady fucked up and then tried to what? 
[00:12:00]  She was sealing up the open wounds.  Sealing up the wounds.  Right.  With bounty paper towels and crazy glue.  And crazy glue.  Like she was trying to inject it in her ass.  Just raw silicone.  Probably construction grade.  Yeah.  Because they've been doing that.  Like they go to Home Depot and get like caulking and silicone caulking and then just fucking  put it in their ass.  And then these gaping wounds opened up and she put bounty paper towel in there with crazy  glue.  To try to seal it.  And then of course the woman dropped it. 
[00:12:30]  She couldn't stitch it?  She's not a doctor.  Yeah.  They open up these clinics.  Because she panicked.  She panicked obviously.  She didn't know what the fuck to do if something went wrong.  Oh you just put some paper towels and crazy glue in there.  Are people really getting that done at?  Yeah.  They have these silicone parties and they inject each other with fucking silicone.  Is that safe?  No.  It's not safe.  You can't just put silicone in your body without it being in some type of container.  But where's the logic where someone speaks up and goes, look, we shouldn't be doing this. 
[00:13:00]  Because they're idiots first of all.  They're uneducated.  And I will put a face and a race to this.  Because it's mostly Hispanic people.  Hispanic women and gay Hispanic men go for the booty shots.  What?  They want fucking giant booties.  Is that true, Mars?  Yes.  Yeah.  You know that too?  Yes.  The hoochie mamas, don't they have an ass already?  Yeah, but they want more ass.  And the gay men.  Why do you want such a big ass?  And the gay men. 
[00:13:30]  He just said, point it to Mars.  You know about the gay men?  And gay men, gay Hispanic guys want the big ass too.  Why?  And they put it all over too.  They put it like in pecs and in calves and lips.  They try to like, it's really sick.  So what happens to you?  Your body rejects it.  And you wind up getting huge infections.  And they're not smart enough to understand this?  No.  They think, oh, it's silicone.  That's good, right?  That's good.  I like the silicone.  It makes my ass look big. 
[00:14:00]  It's nice, right?  And then all of a sudden, you know, your ass fell off.  Are they trying to get a black woman's ass?  I think they're trying for a, what?  Holy fuck.  Oh, sorry.  Like a Nicki Minaj or something?  Oh, really?  Trying for one of those?  Ooh, did I hear a horror story about her from a driver once?  Oh, yeah?  He said she was the worst person he ever drove, and he almost put her out of his vehicle.  Wow.  Because she was such a fucking twat.  I'm screaming at him the whole ride.  I'm not a fan of the almost stories.  Well, no, he spoke to her, and he said, if you curse at me again, I'm putting you out of the car. 
[00:14:30]  And then she stopped.  Oh, good for him.  Okay, that's fair enough.  Her ass is too big, though.  It's awful.  She's a good rapper, though, right?  Yeah.  It's just, that's, that's, it's just not in my DNA.  Why is that attractive, Mars?  It's too big.  That's too big.  That's too big.  What do you mean?  I've seen some of the big asses you and Danny have looked at in the past, when you guys used  to be friends.  You guys used to bond over the booties.  I remember.  Maybe that'll get you, maybe that's what will get you and Danny back together, looking at booties 
[00:15:00]  again.  Damn, that's a nice ass.  Damn, that's a nice ass.  Yeah.  Dude, you've shown us bigger asses.  No.  I'm telling you.  Down the hall.  What's her big song?  I don't know.  She's not really known for anything.  She is.  Is she?  Yeah, she is.  She just has a name, but I don't know what she's really known for.  Super Bass is big on the radio right now. 
[00:15:30]  Is it?  Is it?  Is it good?  I mean, it's a little top 40-ish.  She used to be a very sort of dirty rapper.  What's a dirty rapper?  Yeah, like Lil' Kim, very sexual, a lot of bad words.  But then she put out her album, and it's a lot more top 40 friendly, which was smart  because she's got a lot more kids.  Is she good, Sam?  Yeah.  You be the judge.  I think we have some Nicki Minaj right here.  What I've heard of her, she was good. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, yeah.  I would never be able to bring her to a family function.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  No.  She shows up with all that shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  I would have been laughed out of my family.  Drummed out of the regimen.  She has an interesting voice, though. 
[00:16:30]  She's got a fat pussy.  Look.  Jimmy, look.  That's not her.  That's her.  That's a lot.  What do you think?  There's a lot going on down there, Jimmy.  Looks like a ball bag.  I would lick it.  I would lick it.  That's kind of a painting.  I want to see a real picture.  Looks like a catcher's mitt.  Yeah, that's the look they're going for, though, with this silicone injection.  She sounds like she could have been in the movie Rio.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A movie I've seen probably a hundred times.  She has a weird voice, but I kind of like it. 
[00:17:00]  It's interesting.  Yeah, it's cool.  Her cadence is interesting.  It's a cool sound.  I just don't know much about her.  Mm-hmm.  She's got that whiny sound.  I want to hear the song about the Australian War from 1915.  No, it's from the 71.  He wrote it.  There's a live version of it.  His name is Eric Boulder.  No, but he's referencing the War of 1915.  Oh, Bogle.  I'm sorry.  B-O-G-L-E.  What does this sound like?  I'm curious now.  I don't have a lot.  I like when Jimmy picks music.  I don't have a live version. 
[00:17:30]  No, go to the live version.  Let's go.  I'm the only dummy picking music.  Ant doesn't pick music.  Go, Eric Bogle.  Unfortunately.  No.  I'd like to know what you're listening to.  Yeah, that's it.  He talked for a couple seconds first.  He could zip through his fucking babble.  Was this guy ever known in the States?  I don't know.  You never heard this?  I like this type of shit.  I like being in an Irish pub and drinking Guinness and hearing this. 
[00:18:00]  That's the only time.  It's got to be in context.  I couldn't listen to this driving.  Yeah, but although I would probably be drunk then, too.  Of course you would be.  No difference.  But the pub smells better than you.  After you farted at me, you fuck.  In that situation, though, you know everything's right with the world.  You know what I mean?  You're in that bar and you hear this coming from the stage.  You don't have a worry in the world at that moment.  Ah, the Pete.  Ah, the Pete.  And they gave me a gun. 
[00:18:30]  And they marched me away to the wall.  Oh, boy.  It doesn't end well.  This ain't going to be good.  Sure doesn't come back to a loving family and settle down, open a business.  No?  No.  No.  Oh, the beginning.  It's all nice. 
[00:19:00]  Gallipoli.  Jesus.  Gallipoli.  It's a long song.  Oh, of course it is.  That's all we do.  It's in real time.  It's in real time, the war.  We're not a music show.  That's all we do.  He has another song that's really good, too.  This is how I found him.  It was his other song.  It was called And Now I'm Easy.  He's good, man.  Is he like Sunday morning?  No.  I think it almost means like now everything's okay because he knows he's going to die soon.  Jeez. 
[00:19:30]  These guys are morbid.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  His wife dies in this song.  Fucking giving birth.  This guy rules.  Wow.  It's depressing.  Yeah.  He's miserable.  Death, destruction, and drinking.  But I never...  Well, the war.  They go to the war.  Yeah.  What happens?  Well, it's the fight in the Turks.  It's not good, Ant.  Yeah.  It ain't good.  It ain't good, right?  And, uh, you know, he's fucking...  The band plays Waltzing Matilda.  Right.  But then he fucking goes to the war and gets his legs blown off. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, no.  And there'll be no more waltzing for him.  Oh, shit.  He can't waltz anymore.  He comes back and there's...  That's a shame.  No, uh, you know, the people can't, like, eye contact with them when they're coming off  the ship.  It's very good.  Oh.  He was never known...  Rolling Matilda.  Okay.  He was never, uh, known in Australia.  Australia either.  Oh, no.  I don't know where he's from.  Was he from England?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I thought he was Irish.  I'm going to check him out online, though.  I thought he was Irish.  Maybe he is Irish.  Maybe he's Australian. 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  Where is he from?  Somebody knows.  Eric Bogle.  I really dig him.  That's the beauty of this fucking show.  Where is he from?  Help us out.  But I checked out a few of those fucking Irish guys.  Can't you just do it on this?  What?  Can't you just hit this and go, like...  What's his name?  Eric Nagel.  Oh, just do Eric Nagel just to see what they say.  Where is Eric Nagel from?  Ding.  Florida.  I didn't find any places matching Eric Nagel.  Nagel.  Just say who is. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, no.  They'll just send you to a website, right?  At that point.  Where is the...  With a...  Oh, my God.  I can just tell you.  Where is Eric Bogle...  What's his name?  Bogle.  What?  I can just tell you.  I have...  Where is Eric Bogle from?  Yeah.  I know where you are.  You might have cunt.  I couldn't find any places matching Eric Bogle.  What good are you, you swat? 
[00:21:30]  Who sings waltzing Matilda?  Bitch.  All right.  Where is he from?  He's from Scotland.  He currently resides in Adelaide, Australia.  Scotland.  Why did he go to Australia?  Australia is nice.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Is he hiding from something?  Scottish people.  Yeah.  All right.  He really is a lovely man.  I am.  Got a wonderful story here. 
[00:22:00]  We all got our, like, group of people.  I guess I'm big with the moms these days.  You're big with the...  Not all the moms.  The teens.  Jimmy, who are you, Bebber?  I'm big with people that eat fucking Reese's Pieces after the Tonight Show and don't work out.  Oh, no.  Were you treating yourself?  Yeah.  I had a Kit Kat and Reese's Pieces.  Yeah, to treat yourself.  Oh, Jimmy.  And the night before, I treated myself.  And I treated myself here with lime treats.  Fat pig, selfish fool I am. 
[00:22:30]  Treated yourself.  Yeah, but you had a good appearance, so you had to treat yourself.  Yeah, it was decent, but I was still annoyed.  Fat pig.  I hate my body.  Anyway, her Twitter account is MomsForOpie.  Oh, boy.  This story is unbelievable.  You got a bus driver in Philly.  New Jersey school bus driver accused of DUI and child endangerment.  A New Jersey bus driver has been charged with drunken driving after a middle school student 
[00:23:00]  texted home with, Mommy, I think our bus driver is drunk.  She's not driving right.  Ah, shit.  Turns out the kid was right.  This bus driver, .25.  Wow, that's up there.  I think that's what, five times?  That's a good one.  Is that close to five times in?  .25?  Yeah, close.  Right?  Yeah.  Some of the 25 students on the bus called and texted their parents Tuesday.  One texted, I don't want to die today. 
[00:23:30]  That's something that's great for kids to have to go through.  But then the parents called the police.  They found the bus.  They pulled them over.  Or this person over.  I'm not sure if it's a...  He or she.  He or she.  Is it?  She.  Carol should be either.  Carol O'Connor?  Yes.  I got a picture.  She was released on $85,000 bail.  Now, Carol, that's not a name I've heard on a man before, but it's all right.  Boy, that's not good. 
[00:24:00]  You should just stop the bus and get off once you know the jig's up.  It's good that...  And then run away until you get fucking sober.  It's good that the kids have the phones.  Right.  Yeah.  Little tattletales.  Rats, you just want to have a few cocktails before you've got to drive these noisy little  fucks around.  Who cares?  Were you suspicious of your bus driver growing up?  Many times.  I always was.  You know, Eddie Spaghetti with the meatball eyes.  Right.  Used to come pick me up.  And Eddie Spaghetti with the meatball eyes would...  Right when you walked up the stairs, you'd look up at the bus driver, and Eddie Spaghetti 
[00:24:30]  flipped his upper eyelids up and made like that reddish, nasty stuff, and we called him  Eddie Spaghetti with the meatball eyes.  And he was weird.  Did he ever get thrown against your wall?  One time...  No.  One time, Eddie Spaghetti took a corner really tight by a telephone pole, and you know those  foot pegs that the telephone repairman climb on?  On the telephone?  It went right through one of the windows and ripped out like three of the windows.  As he made the turn, and the bus kind of went...  It got like spun on a pivot. 
[00:25:00]  While you guys were on it?  Yeah, we were on it.  We all went like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And then we were like, Eddie Spaghetti, you hit the pole, you hit the pole.  And all he would do is look up in that dumb mirror and look at us and go, no, I didn't.  I did not.  You can see the damage.  I know.  But he was adamant that he did not.  I love it.  Eddie Spaghetti, Eddie Spaghetti, you hit the pole.  Who would go into that line of work?  I'm suspicious of all bus drivers.  I'm sorry.  Yes, yes.  But I'm thinking the average bus driver isn't going to bed early and getting a good night's  sleep for his gig.  I know.  I never liked that whole Illuminati thing they do also when they pass each other, bus 
[00:25:30]  drivers.  They'd give that little wave like, I'm a bus driver too.  We all know what we're doing.  Right.  I'm on crystal meth and so are you.  Yeah.  I just hit a pole.  Right.  What if you hit today?  They give that wave when they pass each other.  Yeah.  Man, we all know what we're doing.  What are you, touching the kids?  Yeah.  Touching the kids.  Ah, this is the shit I hate about being a father.  Because there's no way my kid's going to be on a school bus.  Get the fuck out of here.  What are you going to do?  Private car service? 
[00:26:00]  I guess I'll...  So he gets made fun of?  I'll be retired by then.  I'll just drive him to school, fuck it.  Really?  Before I play golf or something.  It's pretty inconvenient.  I know.  What are you going to do, though?  I don't know.  You throw him on a bus like we were.  I guarantee you.  You throw him into society and hope for the best, Opie.  That's what you're going to have to do.  Launch him into the fucking muck that is society and hope he comes out okay.  You know what, Ant?  I think you're absolutely right.  Yeah.  In the end, I think you're absolutely right.  I got all these worries, but in the end, you got to just fucking push him from the nest.  You just got to push him forward.  You can't make him soft. 
[00:26:30]  Because that's why these fucking teenagers don't know how to handle failure or bad grades.  Because they don't have any fucking negativity or very little.  Right.  A certain amount of it is okay.  A certain amount of it is okay.  He's going to get punched at some point.  He's going to break his arm at some point.  He's going to fucking be insulted.  He's going to be wronged.  It's all that shit.  But you're there after it happens to give him that little talk of why this happens and stuff.  Oh, I thought you meant to punch the kid in the face that broke his arm.  No, no, no. 
[00:27:00]  He's got to do it himself.  I can't do that?  Yeah, like my dad told me.  I was getting my ass kicked there in Central Islip.  Yeah.  And my pop told me, he goes, look, here's what you do.  He goes, there's no fucking, you don't have to feel bad about picking up a big fucking stick  and just wailing somebody with the big fucking stick if you don't feel you can fight this person one-on-one.  And I was like, all right.  So I had an altercation.  I picked up a big stick and fucking right across the back.  Really?  Wham! 
[00:27:30]  Did the stick break in half?  Yeah, it did.  As a matter of fact, it was kind of this loose, wet fucking moldy stick, but it broke.  And I threw it down, and then I was walking away all proud, going like this.  And my father's on the patio.  He's like, what the fuck did you do?  I was like, I did what you told me to.  He goes, you don't hit a girl!  Yeah, she was bigger than me, and she was giving me shit, and I didn't want to fight 
[00:28:00]  her, so I just picked up the stick like pops told me and fucking wailed her across the  back with it as she was walking away.  Oh, isn't that great?  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, so Dad yelled at me again.  Yeah, and I just started crying.  What I need to know is, can my kid take one suspension?  Suspension.  Yeah.  All right, good.  Why not?  Because that's what's going to happen.  Anyone fucks with him, I'm going to tell him to hit the kid as hard as he can.  Take the one suspension, but I think at that point, then the word's out.  Prison rules.  You get that prison rep. 
[00:28:30]  Is that possible, you think?  In school, the prison rep?  Yeah, you get that.  But then people will gun for you.  But is a big punch to the face grounds to kick him out of school?  These days, might be.  That's what I have to do.  Might have to go to counseling and everything.  Yeah, you know what?  In the old days, you could just punch somebody and you'd get detention.  I'll tell him to fake it, as far as the counseling goes.  Make believe you're concerned and understanding and stuff.  I don't know.  He's got to build up what they call a sense of humor.  Because that gets you out of a lot of shit in school. 
[00:29:00]  I only got into a, I mean, maybe two fights my entire school career.  Because I was just, you know, I was the funny guy.  You've got to be funny guy.  And then you don't get into shit.  It's nerdy, dickhead, douchebag guy that gets punched all the time.  And it's jock, fucking troublemaker, bully guy that does the punching.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You've got to fit in somewhere nice with both of them.  You're absolutely right, Ant.  Mike in Jersey with a really good observation. 
[00:29:30]  Go ahead, Mikey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I think you guys are missing the whole point here on that story.  She was released on an $85,000 bail, yet Sandusky, who was raping kids, was released on a $100,000 bail.  What's up with that?  $15,000 for a, it's only $15,000 difference for driving a kid around while you're drunk.  Right.  Or fucking him in the ass.  In the shower.  Wow.  Well, at least Sandusky was only fucking one at a time.  That's true.  He didn't have 30 of them.  A busload.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Hit him out, apparently, now.  You know what?  I, and probably, I think Dan listens to the same news.  He's on the way in.  Yeah, on the way in, yeah.  Did you fucking hear the lawyer talking this morning?  No.  Which one?  It makes you want to just fucking punch the first person you see.  Saying that he was showering with the boy, but there was no sex going on?  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard that.  I fuck, it makes you hate fucking lawyers.  Now, how many of us have showered with 10-year-olds?  I do understand it does happen.  But, I guess that's supposed to make most of us go, oh, oh, okay. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  I understand now.  It's the same thing as when Michael Jackson said he wasn't having sex with the children,  but he would sleep with them.  Right.  In the same bed.  Right.  And we were supposed to go, oh, that makes total sense.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, oh, that's better.  Everyone seems to have forgotten about the fact that he completely, he didn't fess up to  having sex with kids, but he completely fessed up to sleeping in the same bed and holding  children as they slept.  Right.  Which, to me, is fucking creepy, and it's a lie, if you ask me, because I think, you 
[00:31:00]  know, he's not going to be able to hold himself back.  And can I tell you something?  Once again, a lot of father shit today.  Sorry, but.  Father.  My son still sleeps with us, but we're trying to, you know, move him.  Toss him into the fucking room.  We're trying to move him into his own place now.  Does he have a bed?  Yeah, he's got a lot.  In his own place, like an apartment?  Yeah, you know.  I think it's time.  Yeah, it's time he moves out.  Start making a living for yourself.  Right, it's time.  But, I mean, he's my son.  He's 18 months old, and I'm already, like, feeling like this is not right. 
[00:31:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I get you all to be in the room, right?  It's right up there.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  To be honest with you.  Yeah, you got to give him a little bed.  But I'm just saying, like, now, okay, I, now I'm having strange boys in my bed.  Oh, dear.  And how old are they?  Yes.  Woo!  They're 10 years old!  How old were the Michael Jackson kids?  They were, like, about the same age, 12.  That is...  Around there.  And how do people go, oh, okay. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, that's okay.  He was just sleeping with them.  Woo!  I'm always starting to feel weird with my own kid at 18 months old.  Yeah.  Does he stay in your bed, or is he in a crib in the room?  No, in our bed.  We got a huge, massive...  What do you do when you want relations?  We figure it out.  Yeah?  How?  Where do you put them?  We throw them on the floor.  Duct tape them in a closet.  We tell them to go do the dishes.  Well, seriously, how do you do that?  You find ways.  What?  With the baby there and no one babysits?  Well, that is rough.  How do you do that?  No, there's ways. 
[00:32:30]  Do you put them in another room?  Yes!  What do you think?  I don't know.  I don't have no kids.  Yeah.  You put them in the crib?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He's got a crib.  A little Benadryl?  A little Benadryl.  A little whiskey, you know.  Casey Anthony, fucking Zanny the Nanny.  A little Zanny the Nanny.  It's your job as parents to figure it out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's not as easy because, you know, he's in our bed, but... 
[00:33:00]  You can't do that just spontaneous reach over?  Right now, not so much.  Yeah, that's rough, huh?  Not so much.  I would think.  But do you have to say, like, all right, go put them in the other room and you both know  what that means?  Or do you say, like...  Just wait.  Yeah, I feel like putting a baby in the other room, if you know what I mean, sweetie.  The job's getting done.  But Sandusky with this 10-year-old and now the lawyer saying, oh, he was just showering  with the boy.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  That's it.  Why doesn't he explain how that's acceptable?  Oh, yeah.  How does that fucking go down?  How do you break the ice there?  Hey, kid.  Want to shower?  Right.  Just get naked.  Yeah, I don't know.  Now they're looking into the...  Is it Dusky or Dunsky?  Dusky.  Dusky?  Dusky.  It's like Ohio.  Now supposedly he might have brought a kid to the Alamo Bowl.  Oh, boy.  I mean, and we're talking before the show, it's like, how do you get that fucking done?  Without everyone, like, going, what the fuck is he up to? 
[00:34:00]  I'm willing to bet that everyone knew or at least had an inkling of what was going on.  A lot of suspicions, right?  You can't have somebody that's been doing this for as long as he's been doing it, with  as many children as he's done this with, and not at least make jokes about it.  Like, remember the parento jokes that would go around even before he went to jail?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, that's kind of the situation.  It's like, oh, we all know what he's up to.  You don't have, like, the physical evidence, but there's been enough rumor and innuendo  around where you know what's going on. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  That's the situation that went on here.  I think for anyone to then see him taking a child out of state on some event and not  say something is fucking, like, ludicrous.  It's amazing to me.  I wouldn't say it's criminal, but it's morally an outrage.  Well, I like to always bring shit into our world, okay?  So Jimmy's going to be at the Borgata soon.  Yes.  He's bringing a young boy.  He is.  Well, I'm just saying, let's say me or you, we go down there, and all of a sudden, in 
[00:35:00]  front of, like, all the people associated with Jim Norton's show, so you've got the other  comics, people that are putting on the show behind the scenes, then you've got the inner  core of fans and all the, just people, you know, the circle of people.  Right.  And all of a sudden, me or you show up with a little 11-year-old kid.  How are people not, like, raising their eyebrows going, what the fuck is Oprah doing?  Or what the fuck is Ann up doing?  Hold on.  I've got to make a phone call.  I've got to cancel something. 
[00:35:30]  What is the difference, though?  Really?  The difference is people knew he was involved in a project that helped those kids.  So if one of you guys was involved in a Big Brother type of thing, we were like,  you know what, man?  So that kind of...  We're, like, doing this, and you were doing it for a while, and it was always in the university.  Like, I'm taking a kid to a game.  It probably seemed very acceptable.  That's why fucking creepy pedophiles put themselves where kids are going to be, because then they  have acceptable access to them.  Because some adults have to have access to kids.  But I can't imagine that people weren't looking going, hmm, you hear the stories that are  coming out of the woodwork.  Maybe, but he says he's like a man's man. 
[00:36:00]  A coach?  Right.  A coach who's used to being around young men.  He's been coaching young men.  He's been showered.  He's shower with William.  Woo!  Major West!  I'm going to go on...  You're a cock blocker, Major West!  I'm going to go on record and say that a lot of people fucking knew, but didn't want  their positions blown up.  Simple as that, because it was such a huge, major fucking football program.  You know?  They were seeing their own careers going bye-bye if they spoke up too much.  Yeah, I think people knew. 
[00:36:30]  And I really think this is, we're, as they say, scratching the surface of this.  I think this goes a lot deeper.  I think at some point, you're going to see a wholesale wipeout of everybody that had anything  to do with this.  It's just the beginning.  And the school is going to face all kinds of charges and civil penalties and lawsuits.  This is going to go deeper.  And fuck those students, by the way.  Oh, that's what they were doing.  Fuck you guys and your loyalty.  I get it.  You're like Paterno.  If this was a consensual adult, if he got caught fucking an 18-year-old student, I would be 
[00:37:00]  with you.  Like, you know what, man?  Hey, at that age.  But you fucking assholes rioting babies.  Just prove him.  Fuck him finishing on the field.  Right.  He didn't go to the police when he heard that a kid was being fucked in the ass in the gym.  A 10-year-old.  A 10-year-old in the shower.  So should he get carried out on the shoulders one more time?  Bleeding boy, asshole.  Good job, coach. 
[00:37:30]  Whistle.  Whistle.  Team animal.  We are Penn State.  No, you got a fucking bug.  Oh, they fucking bug me.  Because again, he knew and he didn't go.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  Yeah.  You know what?  Yeah.  It's not good, man.  He's not a dumb guy.  These students are showing they're not learning shit in college.  They're just fucking idiots.  Because they don't get it.  Is it a drag?  Abso-fucking-lutely. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Because everything you thought you knew is wrong.  Sorry, but it's wrong.  There was some crazy shit going on at that college for a really, really long time.  And the problem is...  Oh, hell yeah.  I don't care about his legacy because to me, that's the problem.  They're all worried about the university and the legacy and the money that comes in.  Yep.  And Paterno would have survived and been fine if he had done the right thing and fucking  gone to the cops.  You don't go to the president.  He should have been in cuffs like that fucking day.  Or at least he could have been on record going to the police. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  If he heard it was one of his grandkids being fucked in the ass, would he have just quietly  went to the fucking president?  Oh, fucking no, man.  And talked to Curly about it?  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Nah, nah, nah.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Oh.  Ah, certainly.  Talk to me.  Hey, I'll fix everything.  Hey, he hit him in the head with a pipe.  Doesn't work without the music, I guess.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, well.  Sorry.  Oh, it's Travis back there. 
[00:39:00]  Eric had to make an emergency duty.  Oh, Nagel and his shits.  That's reversible.  Right.  His shit schedule sucks.  It really does.  He shits during the fucking first break of the show.  I know, that's our job.  I pump out two good sessions before that fucking ecstasy of gold hits, man.  Oh, I can't.  I'm right.  Ecstasy of brown and then ecstasy of gold.  I'm ready.  I'm cleared out.  What the fuck does he, Rocky?  He has to take a shit.  What does he?  He's shitting tinfoil right now.  He's shitting license plates from fucking Kansas. 
[00:39:30]  Or you know he's trying to force a sneaker pass.  So you don't think there should be a big over-the-top pep rally for Joe Pah?  Coasted it again.  Rally, rally, rally.  Us, us, us.  Rally, rally, rally.  Tough shit.  Kid got fucked in the dumper.  Party over.  That negates everything.  Yes. 
[00:40:00]  And now they're talking that maybe this guy was pimping.  That's the story.  The latest rumor.  I guess it's a DJ in Pennsylvania broke this story, right?  Yeah.  He wrote a whole article like six months ago.  Yeah.  He broke the story, and it was based originally on rumor.  And it turned out to be true.  And his story, like Travis said, I thought it was, whatever, six or seven months ago.  This was out there.  Good thing the university still gave the guy access.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  There was a massive cover-up going on. 
[00:40:30]  There's no other way to look at this.  But now there's also rumor, and this same DJ came out and said, look, there's also rumor,  and I don't like putting rumor out there, but this is how this started, that he was actually  pimping, Jerry Sandusky was pimping out young boys to some wealthy gentlemen that wanted  young boys.  Fucking gosh.  If there's any credence to that whatsoever, this school is fucking just going to be blown 
[00:41:00]  out.  Everyone gone.  The reputation of this school is fucked.  It's already tarnished.  It's fucked.  Because they're just starting to dig in, man.  Yeah.  This is going to get way uglier.  And that pedophile, if he had just, let's just say he had done it.  I don't know if he did it, but say he did do it, and they went after him publicly and  got rid of him immediately, the school would have been fine because these fucking people  show up everywhere.  They show up in schools.  They show up in fucking, you know, in religion.  They show up everywhere.  So I don't think people would have penalized the school.  No.  But everybody's worried about their legacy. 
[00:41:30]  And the university and the alma, what do they call the fucking assholes that won't let  their fucking youth go?  Alma mater.  Let it go.  I went to school there in 1957.  Well, you're not there now.  Fucking move on.  The alumni.  Whatever they are.  The alumni.  What do I call them?  I kind of like alma mater.  Alma mater.  Fuck them.  But that's because I said it.  I kind of like going back to my old college.  Ah, it's valueless.  Stay away.  For what?  I kind of like it.  I don't go back to the chicks I fucked when I was, I used to fuck you when I was 19. 
[00:42:00]  Here's some money.  By the way, Paterno hired a criminal lawyer, too.  Oh, I know.  I'm telling you, man.  Hired a criminal lawyer.  This is just getting started.  Yeah.  He's in trouble.  This is going to end with some, it's going to get ugly.  He's 85, at least.  Sandusky is what, in his 60s?  Oh, yeah.  He's got a long way to go.  Oh, boy.  He should do the proper thing and fucking hang himself.  It wouldn't surprise me if he commits suicide.  He is on Suicide Watch.  Is he?  That's what they said.  Why is he out?  Oh, why is he out?  That's right. 
[00:42:30]  Why is he out?  Why is he out on bail?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Someone said he was spotted in a local gym in, what was the other fucking place I read?  Chuck E. Cheese?  Chuck E. Cheese, I believe.  In the ball pit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was in a local gym.  The balls in his mouth.  And then a local mic.  And a local peach.  Always funny.  Goddamn.  Are you going to be watching the big game tomorrow?  Ah, the big game.  The big game.  I bet this game gets a lot of people watching.  Fuck, I'm watching. 
[00:43:00]  Just to see.  What time's the game on tomorrow?  What goes on?  I'm watching.  Fuck yeah.  Is ESPN covering it?  Hmm.  Probably.  It's the last home game?  Yeah.  Home out game?  What?  The students are going to embarrass the fucking university.  They're going to hold up signs.  They're going to embarrass themselves.  Joe Pa.  We miss you.  Joe Pa.  Joe Pa.  Enabling douchebags.  Exactly.  Get over it.  He's 85 with a giant honker.  And you didn't do enough where the boy's shitter was being violated. 
[00:43:30]  Tough titties.  Who cares if you can't carry him off?  I like the way he tried to set the ground rules to, I'm retiring at the end and I won't  hear any no's.  Yeah.  They're like, no you're not.  Beat it now.  Scram.  Get out.  I wonder if...  Joe Pa!  I wonder if any of these football players will make a stand.  No.  They won't, right?  They'll take the ball and run with it.  Really?  They're going to have a big meeting with all of them to just shut their fucking mouths.  Don't talk to the press.  Don't say a word or you're fucking gone.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  This is your future, guys.  Yeah.  You want to fuck up your careers?  You get out there and talk.  Go ahead.  Do it.  Yeah.  They're all going to run through the giant Nittany line.  Look, it's a line.  It's knitting me a sweater.  I banned so many people yesterday for sending me that.  I'm banning Nittany Lion fucking tweets.  It's a funny Nittany Lion fucking tweets.  Yeah.  The first time I heard it.  Because you've got to think, two weeks into the scandal, we all have heard the fucking  joke.  Please stop.  Yeah.  Just please, I beg you.  Just stop. 
[00:44:30]  I am...  You're embarrassing yourself.  It's not even bothering me.  You're just embarrassing yourself.  I did that.  And if you're listening and you realize that you've been banned by me, also, you were sending  me Bobo tweets.  You were retweeting Bobo tweets with my name attached to it.  And I won't have it.  So if you're questioning why you're banned from seeing my wonderful tweets, you're gone.  Bobo.  Yeah.  I'm here.  What the fuck do you want?  Now, I haven't spoken to you guys in a while. 
[00:45:00]  Well, that's true.  Okay.  You're on the air.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  What do you got, Bobo?  Make a Friday show better.  Go ahead.  Go.  What do you got?  Great.  I mean, it's been so long.  Yeah, but now you're on.  You're on.  So you're on.  What do you got?  What did you call for?  Go.  What do you got?  Go.  You're telling the whole world that you were on hold all day yesterday, which was true,  by the way.  And that you were calling again today.  So now you're on.  So go ahead.  Entertain everybody.  Go.  Go.  Go.  One thing.  Go.  One thing.  There was a good idea.  This on Thursday's show, on the 17th, that what happened was I was thinking, 
[00:45:30]  it'd be great.  I need to have a chick with a baby that has enormous boobs to see if I can see if they  can catch the football in their boobs.  It's not a great good idea, but he did present one.  He's saying he's better than 90% of the people around here.  Yes.  Bobo, we know better than you.  You just chill the fuck out, sit out for a while, and eventually we'll figure out something 
[00:46:00]  for you.  All right, I'll see you guys at 17th.  Why is he banned from the show, though?  He's not banned from the show, but he's extremely needy.  Bobo, did your mommy take away your XM because you tweeted pictures of your cock?  No.  He tweeted pictures of his cock.  People were saying that.  No, really?  Yeah, he tweeted pictures of his dick.  Bobo, you're ruining your legacy.  Just sit out, relax, know in the end we do like you, and we'll figure something out 
[00:46:30]  eventually.  You're a real pile of Sandusky.  All right, I'll see you guys.  Why would he get that?  I'll see you guys.  We've got an intern Matt, so we don't need Bobo.  Where's Bobo?  He's around.  Is he around today?  Intern Matt?  Yeah.  Oh, is he not here?  By the way, the students are encouraging everyone to wear white tomorrow for Joe Pa.  Oh, that's good.  The purity of a boy that was fucking taken away, that white can represent that. 
[00:47:00]  You dummies.  I got the initial loyalty, and this is not a media lynching.  I don't think he went to the cops.  And if he didn't go to the cops...  No, he didn't go to the cops.  I read the entire indictment, which is rough, by the way.  Then he didn't go...  Then fuck him.  23 fucking pages.  I haven't read 23 pages straight in a long time.  I just don't understand how they can defend him other than the fact that they like him  and they don't want to see him get in trouble.  Yeah.  I just...  I don't know what's being reported accurately.  Is there more students pissed off or supporting? 
[00:47:30]  There's enough pissed off, I'm sure.  I heard the screaming...  What do you think the numbers are?  The school has 40,000 students.  Wow.  What do you think the percentage is, really?  Because, you know, we all know the media goes for the one angle, and it makes it look like  that's what everyone's thinking.  About half and half.  You think about half and half?  60-40 in favor of firing him, yeah.  Because I think that most people can see, especially as time has gone on now, and you realize,  oh, it's not just the lynching.  He actually did not go to the police.  He deserves to be fired. 
[00:48:00]  He doesn't...  Tough shit he can't walk off with his fucking...  It's a dumb...  I like football, but it's a dumb sport.  You've thrown a ball.  He did nothing.  If one of his fucking team...  If something bad was happening to a member of his team, he would have taken a lot more  decisive action.  Mm-hmm.  Even if it didn't involve the police.  And he said he wishes he had done more.  And when he came out, that self-serving horse shit, I just love you, kids.  I love you, boys and girls.  Shut up. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You should have fucking proven you loved them by fucking going to the cops and not thinking  of your dumb defensive coordinator, whatever the fuck Sandusky was.  At the time, right?  Yeah.  Fuck him, man.  It's terrible.  It's an amazing story.  It's only going to get worse.  I love it.  I love watching the whole thing fucking fall apart.  Yeah.  Not against Penn State.  I've never worked there.  I don't dislike them, but it's just fun to watch fucking shit blow up.  Let's be honest.  And what is it?  Mike McQuarrie, right?  McQuarrie, yeah.  McQuarrie.  Is that the weirdest name?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  He's the guy that witnessed Sandusky with the 10-year-old in the shower.  That's what he says, yes.  And he ran scared and called his father, and then he told Joe Paterno, right?  And then Joe just told for Curly.  Hey, Curly, why don't you go to the police or something?  Ah, I should go to the police department.  Hey, Moe.  Oh, boy, we're all going to rape children. 
[00:49:30]  No, no.  Hey, get away from that boy.  Larry, what are you doing?  I'm going to stick my penis in here.  It feels good.  They should throw balloons at the Stooges' toe.  Ah, they should, Chip.  So here's the question.  McQuarrie, he's not coaching tomorrow.  We all pretty much knew that, right?  Yeah.  Who is Gary Glitter?  The stupid university is claiming because of death threats. 
[00:50:00]  Death threats to him, yeah.  And then the media reports it like that without anyone editorializing and saying, no, man, read between the fucking lines.  Yeah.  They don't know what the fuck to do with this guy yet.  Why hasn't he been fired?  That's the question a lot of people are asking.  Well...  Here's a guy that actually saw it going down and did not call the police.  So why is he not fired?  Maybe because he talked to Paterno, who is...  I'm guessing.  Maybe Paterno assured him.  No, no.  We got it. 
[00:50:30]  We're taking care of it.  We're going right out...  Maybe he was told some bullshit.  If they fired him right off the bat and then in an investigation found out, yeah, that he went to Paterno, Paterno told him, all right, I'll handle this.  You did your job.  Good.  Thank you.  Then he could probably sue.  Yeah, but they're not holding him, keeping him away from coaching because of death threats.  It's bullshit.  They just don't know what to do with this guy.  He's keeping a distraction on the field.  Exactly.  It would be a giant distraction.  Yeah.  Hey, you know...  Hey, it's... 
[00:51:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  Here's the guy.  There's the guy who's on the ass fucking...  And it's second and ten, and he takes the ball, and he runs.  He's got three yards.  And it's the man who's on the ass fucking.  That's the time the camera goes by him.  It's the man.  You know, he could go.  Oh, the ass fucking guy, ass fucking guy.  What did you see?  Ass fucking...  Oh, the...  How long am I going to do it?  A lot of people on Twitter have been saying state whistleblower laws or whatever.  What does that mean?  What?  If you're the guy that blows the whistle on a scandal, you're safe from shit. 
[00:51:30]  That's crazy.  Is there an actual law?  People have said state whistleblower laws.  Is that an actual thing?  Well, I think it's something about giving the referees oral sex.  Because you're going to be a whistleblower.  If you're the whistleblower in something like this, you're safe from prosecution or safe from what?  It's the whistleblower law firm.  Let's say.  Probably from...  I mean, you can't be terminated probably for blowing the whistle.  Oh, but he didn't call... 
[00:52:00]  Oh, they vary greatly throughout the United States.  Understand your state's whistleblowers contacting an attorney.  Oh, I have no idea what it is.  Whistle.  Whistleblower.  Whistle?  Whistle.  It's not whistle?  I say whistle.  Whistle.  Whistle.  What's that T doing in there?  Stop it.  I don't know.  Stupid English.  It fucks up the word sometimes.  I mean, imagine the horror of an intern walking in and seeing one of our staff members raping a boy. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  What would they do?  I'd say one of the interns came in after hours and say, E-Rock.  Let's say it's you.  No, I would never rape a boy.  Let's say E-Rock, yeah.  But E-Rock has a pot.  Let's say E-Rock.  Has it in him?  Yeah, let's say E-Rock is inserting a mayonnaise-coated finger to the boy's rectum to warm him up a little. 
[00:53:00]  And the guy hears something in the office.  Because the office door is closed.  And he just hears, shh, this makes it easier.  Right, right, right.  And then he walks in and Eric has his penis between two hoagie buns.  Oh, boy.  And he's trying to teach the lad to gum the hoagie.  They're playing a game called Gum the Hoagie.  Gum the Hoagie.  Shit.  Well, someone better say something. 
[00:53:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  Pretty cool, huh?  You don't want to blow up your internship, right?  That's how they did it when I was growing up in Florida.  Yeah.  That's what he'd say.  We'd gum each other's hoagies and laugh about it.  Gum the Hoagie.  Well, we'll all watch the big game.  Yeah.  We'll watch it, see what happens.  They're going to have a lot of that band music, Jimmy.  I hope it doesn't drive you nuts.  Yeah.  Love that.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  Get it.  And here comes Joe Pa out on the field.  Joe Pa, beloved coach.  Yay.  The man that didn't say anything when he knew boys were being raped.  Let's give him a big hand.  Everyone's going to wear white.  They should have little red circles  where the heinies are.  Little Japanese flag pants.  These fucking misguided dopes. 
[00:54:30]  Fucking idiots.  Defending a guy who fucking...  He did what he had to do, probably so he couldn't get fired  in a moment. Like, I'm sure he went to his boss.  But what do you say? Gee, there's allegations  he's being fucked in the ass. You gotta bring the state cops in.  No shit. Yeah, it's gotta be  investigation.  We're just getting started with that.  I guarantee it. You think there's more to be told?  Oh my god, so much more.  Starting to say the victim's number is going up  quickly.  It's like now twice the number. 
[00:55:00]  That was originally reported, so what?  Talking close to 20 now.  Some source is saying.  It's time to eat. Yeah, let's eat.  I'm starving.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  What's that?

[00:57:30]  What's the capital of Canada?  Oh no, Saskatchewan  Seriously, anyone here know the capital of Canada?  I honestly do not know  Come on  I would guess  I rest my case  I rest my case  I think it doesn't matter  Of course it matters  Everyone  Who gives a shit  Every Canadian  I don't know the matter  Every Canadian  When you ask them  What's the capital here?  Because the U.S.  They will respond  Because the U.S.  Is popularly more interesting  Because Canadians want to be Americans  We don't give a shit about Canada  Illiteracy  Yes, it is a problem in the U.S.  When we were creating a light bulb to read by 
[00:58:00]  And that's  Ian  Ian  That's my point  You have a Canadian resemblance  New York is not the entire world  Step out  See the world  Get educated  I fly everywhere  You cannot even name the capital of Canada  I don't care about that  I don't give a shit about that  Because we are in business together  What was the original name of Black Sabbath?  What was the original name of Black Sabbath?  I don't care about the Black Sabbath  That's how I feel about Canada's capital  Who gives a shit to them?  It was us  I'll tell you  What's our real name?  Exactly  But any Canadian will name the capital  Because the U.S.

[01:01:00]  You could just tie it into the news story  One news story  What are we looking at, man?  Madonna and Entertainment  Madonna's very upset that her  First news song in three years  Is leaked online  How is it?  Gives a shit  I haven't heard it yet  We're all supposed to make believe that  They're not in on that shit  Can we hear it?  So sick of the same shit  If it's leaked online  We have to have it  What do you mean it was leaked online?  By her  Of course  I really hate celebrities  And I wish I didn't need pictures with them as much 
[01:01:30]  Because I would be such a better person  Yeah  You know what the leaking online thing?  It's simple  Going back a bunch of years with radio, right?  Mm-hmm  You're an artist  You got an album coming out  Here's the first song, everybody  Play it  Right  But it's the same thing  But now you leak it online  It's got to be leaked  So then that's the story  It's leaked  It wasn't supposed to be out  Bullshit  Yeah  Shut the fuck up  And you look like a fucking Muppet  Hurt plastic surgery

I haven't seen her  Her face is completely different now  Yeah, it's not the Madonna  She has these big, huge, over-the-top, puffy cheeks now  Oh, I didn't even look at her  I guess that's what?  You put a lot of shit in there  And it pushes all the wrinkles out?  Is that what that's about?  I guess so  They figure if you inflate a woman's face enough  That the wrinkles go away  But then they end up with a big, fat, inflated face  That's what's going on  They're inflating the face  I hate dumb Botox faces 
[01:02:30]  Those dumb lips  Those weird fucking duck lips that they get  They're good dick-sucking lips, though  Oh, those are horrid  The old broads from all those fucking Housewife shows  Hot, right?

Yeah he has to bond with you on some level  He doesn't watch the show  So he just keeps mentioning that he sees Olivia  From Jerseylicious  In Hoboken  Oh one of your local diners?  We said it was just local  I didn't know if he meant Hoboken or Florida  Oh right right  I mean I'm assuming Hoboken  But it could have been 
[01:08:00]  E-Rock pointed out his favorite diner to me  And then said that Olivia goes there  Right?  That's fair righty?  How could you see anyone behind the piles of food?  He goes  No!  He has a periscope  He just lifts it up  Above his food  This three foot tall sandwich  He has the door open  He's got to look  See who it is  Off the periscope

No  No you gotta go waffles  Waffles  I gotta admit  I like waffles  I haven't had waffles in a while  Because the only way I really really enjoy them  It's so bad  It's the doused with butter  Yeah  And then syrup on it  And then the whipped cream  Why does that make it taste so much better  With a shitload of butter on it? 
[01:09:30]  Because otherwise it's just a hunk of fucking bread  That's solid  Yeah with butter  No no the syrup you put on it  That's fine  But it's nothing compared to butter and syrup  Because butter and syrup tastes good on anything  Why is that?  It's so good  It's so bad for you  You can eat a fucking  A fucking  A rotted pancreas  It would taste good  They sell it with the butter in the syrup already  What?  Oh really?

Yeah  Farting no  But shitting is constant  You don't fart?  It's  I'm not that bad  It's just it's constantly  How do you know you're not doing it when you're sleeping?  I farted in Ann's truck  The other day  Oh wow  It was 
[01:12:30]  Fucking horrendous  And that wasn't even the best  Like I cut a gas  Outside the truck  And I'm like  What am I doing?  And I sat in Ann's fucking driver's seat  And I dragged in the fucking first part of the fart  And the second part I dropped  In the fucking truck  And I got to close the door  Just as you were walking out  It was horrible  Kenny brings my truck in  And parks it in front of the building  And I walk out  And I see Jimmy's in my truck  And the windows are all rolled up  And he's laughing  As he's getting out  And shutting the door  He's cracking up  I went  You fucking farted in my truck  He goes  And then of course he goes

[01:13:30]  What the fuck that was?  It oozed out of the truck  It might have been because  You were on the sidewalk  So maybe your jeans stunk  You saw that  It was so bad  Wow  E-Rod's getting beat up  Thank you  They're wafer fries  Not waffle fries  Not wafer fries  I've heard waffle fries  That's like in church  They're wafer fries  They're waffle fries  Waffle thin  Wafer fries  Waffle  Jim does that too  He'll come in here  During the breaks  Looking for Troy  And then he walks out  And then within 30 seconds  You can't be in this room anymore  It's a gas chamber  And he's just laughing  As he's walking down the hallway 
[01:14:00]  Why wouldn't he be?  Of course  It's always funny  It's hilarious  So what happened with Olivia  From Jerseylicious?  I just used to see her a lot  That's all  And she wears horrible outfits  Oh wow  You don't like the way  A girl dresses like that?  Well she's supposed to  Is she dressed in  Did she dress trashy?  What constitutes a horrible outfit?  Black stockings  Are they exercise clothes?  Black stockings  Leopard skin skirt  And like a lime green tank top  With hoop earrings  That's her  She's trying to present an image 
[01:14:30]  I think  She's doing her Snooki  She's doing a Jersey  Whore  Don't hate  Image  Yeah  We're Team Olivia  Don't do that to us  Don't hate  Lose some weight  That's a tall order  Oh  Oh  Sam  And a wide one  Well good news  Anthony does watch  The Housewives  Well I've seen them  Seen a few  Yeah I've seen a few  You should check out Atlanta  They're all sassy  Black women  I will not get into that  Atlanta's bad  I just go to  A certain website  To get my fill of that 
[01:15:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  Ross Kandusky is destroyed  By what happened to Paterno  His lawyer saying  Oh  How about we don't get  Statements from that  Asshole right now  Yeah  I'm sure he feels guilty  About sinking Paterno  But I wonder how he feels  About the other stuff  Paterno sunk himself  Yeah  Sorry  But he did  Hey  What about  Ashton Kutcher?  He's an idiot  He can't handle his Twitter  What a courageous guy he is 
[01:15:30]  Twitter's very difficult  To handle  Twitter's stupid  Twitter's just stupid  You get a thought  You throw it out there  Hopefully someone digs it  That's it  That's Twitter  So what's the problem  He's saying it got too big  Where he can't handle it anymore  That doesn't make sense  He's got a responsibility  To his 8 million followers  And he can't  He can't be held responsible  For his tweets  He can't  He can't tweet  Without supervision  Opie  That's pretty much  What he's saying  Well he's an out of touch 
[01:16:00]  Hollywood guy  I believe him by the way  He walks by the TV  He sees that Paterno  Was fired  And he couldn't believe  That they would fire Paterno  Yeah  Over the  I don't even think  He knew about the sex scandal  At that point  He didn't  He didn't know about anything  So he tweets like  What the fuck  I can't believe  They fired this guy  Oops  You know  He learns more  And realizes  Oh fuck  I just stuck  You know  Stepped into  Some shit  So he then tweeted  Another tweet  Explained what happened  And that should have been 
[01:16:30]  The end of it  Should have  But now he's a  Panicky Pete  Because he can't handle  The negative  What a fucking  Typical Hollywood  Pussy boy  Like  You tweeted something  Alright you shouldn't  Maybe you  Change your opinion  Whatever it was  And then you  You put your  Instead of just  How about you tell  A few people  To go fuck themselves  You're such a  Not a bad boy  What a fucking  Goody two shoes  The guy from Punk  And that 70s show  Now this is the fucking 
[01:17:00]  Pussy filling  Charlie Sheen's role  Look out  He's a rebel  What a pussy man  It's bothersome  That he's so out of touch  And not aware  Of what's going on  In the world  Well even if he didn't  Know it  And that's fine  And then he changed  But to be so  To be such a coward  That you can't  Handle people  Not liking your opinion  And then you change it  And go oh I didn't  Know it  I realized I shouldn't  Have said that  And that's the end of it  Right  Just say go fuck yourselves  I made a mistake  Oh is that true  Come on  What  Well someone's  Someone here is saying  That Ashton Kutcher 
[01:17:30]  Is  He just tweeted  That he's psyched  To come to New York  To have dinner  At Windows on the World  That's  At the top of the  World Trade Center  Somebody's gotta  That's  Somebody's really  Gotta supervise  Ashton's tweets  That's terrible  Well this statement  Is embarrassing for him  Kutcher pulls back  On Twitter  After Paterno  Tweet  Ashton Kutcher  Is handing over  His Twitter account  To his personal  Management  After he tweeted  Several uninformed  Messages about  Joe Paterno's  Exit from Penn State  Asshole 
[01:18:00]  And you know  What that'll be like  That'll be like  When they have to  Run things past legal  Like he'll tweet  Something  He'll be like  He'll be like  I want to tweet this  Can you go over  With a fine tooth comb  And a fucking  Magnifying glass  And make sure  Nothing bad's in here  But that's why  These celebrities  Fucking stink  Paris Hilton  Was like that  Dummy kept looking  At her publicist  This dumb motherfucker  How about you act  Like a fucking man  And an entertainer  And if you make  A mistake  I'm not saying  He had to stick  With his original tweet  So you took it back  Fucking pussy 
[01:18:30]  He panicked  He deleted tweets  Then he wrote  A little blog entry  About the whole thing  And that should have  Been enough  That's enough  And then he should  Go back to tweeting  Yeah  What a baby  On Wednesday night  Kutcher defended  The football coach  On Twitter  Before learning the details  Of the alleged  Sex abuse scandal  Swirling around  Former assistant  Blah blah blah  Kutcher then recanted  And apologized  On Twitter  He followed with  A blog post Thursday  Saying he would have  His management  Do his feed for him 
[01:19:00]  What a fucking  Cowardly celebrity  As a secondary  Editorial measure  To ensure the quality  Of its content  It's tweet dummy  This is embarrassing  He doesn't trust  His own thoughts  You vapid fucking retard  That's what he's saying  You're not  You're gonna run  Your fucking thoughts  By your fucking managers  What an idiot  Holy shit  Do these guys  Make me sick  They don't even know  Who they are anymore  Yeah  No  What a bunch  Of fucking cowards  The whole spirit  Of Twitter  Is that it's you  Just kind of 
[01:19:30]  Blurting out  140 characters  Of your own  Fucking thoughts  And bullshit  Like to have someone  Go through it  Yeah  And actually  Handing it over  To someone else  Now it's not  His Twitter  Right  It becomes  The Twitter  Of that person  But he can't  Trust himself  So scared  Of controversy  Right  Especially a little bit  They get a bunch  Of negative stuff  How about you  Tell people to go  Fuck themselves  Yeah  What a coward  Kutcher who has  8.2 million followers  Said Twitter had grown  Beyond more than 
[01:20:00]  A fun tool  No it didn't  Stupid  Just have some faith  In yourself  And keep Twittering  It's your thoughts  Whoever doesn't  Want to follow you  Will unfollow you  Dummy  And then he goes  The platform  And this is really  Embarrassing  Has become too big  For him to manage  Alone  Too big  It doesn't matter  What it is  You just  It's just 140 characters  Doesn't matter how many  Fucking subscribers  You have  He's afraid  He's saying it  To 8 million people  Oh no  It's also what a moron 
[01:20:30]  He is though  That instead of  The problem was  That he was misinformed  So instead of just saying  I'm going to start  Reading the newspaper  Yeah yeah  He doesn't draw that  Conclusion  He instead said  I'm going to let  The smart people  I better not talk  Right  Instead of reading  Yeah and being up to date  On current events  I better just not talk  But this is that mentality  And he claims he's  A college football fan  So how did he not  Know all this was going on  I believe him  But he  What?  He knew what was going on  But I bet he didn't know  That  I think what he didn't know  He was probably under the impression 
[01:21:00]  That Paterno had done  All he was supposed to do  Right  I think he probably  Just didn't know the final  He didn't have enough knowledge  I'm guessing yeah  Fuck that's stupid  What a gutless  Fucking dude  It's not like he did  A fucking horrible rape joke  He stated an opinion  Learned more facts  Rethought his opinion  And said that  Right  And this fucking girl  This fucking girl  Can't handle people  Being mad at him  Yeah  What are you afraid of  Look at the guy 
[01:21:30]  You're replacing  You pussy  Look what he just did  Right  You fucking sissy  Yeah  That guy went  All out  And I think this is the type  Of thing you gotta do  To really make it  In this business  Unfortunately  Fuck that  God have a fucking set  Of balls  Just go with it  And hope for the best  Oh I fucking  It really follows you  Huh  Because as a performer  And I know  It's different  To act and do stand up  But as  As an adult male  It makes me so  Fuck  It makes me sick 
[01:22:00]  To my stomach  In a visceral way  Like  It's not that I object  To anything he said  I hate  His fucking  Typical  Cowardice  It's the same  Cowardice  That caused the  Fucking despicable  Oscars  To drop  Brett Ratner  When everybody knows  He said fags  In a juvenile  Schoolyard way  And it was stupid  Yeah  Or was it a poor  Choice of words  Considering who he is  And where he was  Yes  That's all it was  That's all  One of those things  Where you go back  And go  Yeah probably shouldn't 
[01:22:30]  Have said that  And that's all  It should be  You know because of that  We gotta deal with  Welcome to the Oscars  Can you dig it  I knew that you could  You know  Back during Katrina  I lost my horn  That horn meant the world to me  I would play it  Shut up  You're doing it  God  I hope he does it 
[01:23:00]  I hope he does it  On the Oscars  Billy Crystal  Who's been  Now appointed  Host of the Oscars  I hope he does it  Because for a month  I won't stop  For a month  You think it's a good  Safe choice  Stop it  Jimmy's out of this one  It's fine  I will say  You think it's a good  Safe choice  Of course it is  I know  Oh my god  Middle America loves it  It's like  Oh look who's back  Remember when he did  The Silence of the Lambs  I can't wait for the montage  Remember the Silence of the Lambs thing  He came out with the 
[01:23:30]  Fucking mask on  And on the hand truck  Think of how long ago  Silence of the Lambs came out  That's right  Fuck  That's not the same guy anymore  You know when Katrina hit  My home of New Orleans  Shut up  I hate when he does  The black guy  Face  I like face  Face  Do you like it Jimmy  Yeah  Face  They call me face 
[01:24:00]  Cause I make the face  It's an impression  It's an impression  Of a guy he knew  Like a certain  You know  Of course  Of course Jimmy  That's great  That's great  You love it huh  Jimmy loves it  I mean it's fine  It's like  The guy's a good mimic  He's fucking done  Been doing  He's an amazing outlet  He's been doing impressions  For years  See I don't know  If you're one of those  Hollywood types  You gotta overlook 
[01:24:30]  The Brett Ratner thing  Knowing you're gonna have  Fucking Eddie Murphy  Hosting your Oscars  Yeah  Kind of want that right  I would have liked  To have seen that  You put Eddie Murphy  In a position where  Of course he was gonna  Step down right  Oh my god  Who's the fifth band  You stupid shits  At MSNBC  What happened  They listed top five  Metal bands  They listed four  Look how young  Everyone was  This is Billy Crystal  When he hosted  The 64th annual  Yeah  See and he comes out  What do you mean 64th  They're up to 84 now  Yeah  This is 92  This is 92  When he did this

[01:26:00]  Oh  She's joking  Sorry  I don't get it  Remember me  I think they should have  They should have cut that line  It was too long  They should have cut the bit  Coming out  I look like the goalie  From the SAG hockey team  I don't  Well we can  Think that's funny  We can expect  More of that  Only with  It's too bad  90% less energy 
[01:26:30]  It's too bad  But I'll say this  Yeah  At least he's not a  Fucking  Worm  Weasley  Fucking  Fradycat  Like Ashton Kutcher  I never had a big opinion  On Ashton Kutcher  Like I think he's probably  He's a good actor  I don't think he's  Talentless at all  I think he's good  At what he does  But I never realized  What a fucking  What a  Mama's boy  Yeah  Gumdrops to the 
[01:27:00]  That's what  You know what it is  You know how all these  Fucking teenagers  Can't handle when things  Get bad  Because they hear no  Negativity  Now everyone gets  A trophy  These fucking  Creeps  That's why  He can't handle it  Because he's so  Spoken to  Politely  There's no people  Around him  That go  Shut up  That's ridiculous  Quiet  So when he hits  A little controversy  He doesn't know  How to handle it  He doesn't like  Not being liked  Charlie Sheen  Say what you want  About Charlie Sheen  What a fucking  But look what he just did

It's true  It's true  What's Adam's obsession  With being a multi-millionaire  In every movie he does too  By the way  Yeah  Dude  I think  He's on a  He's on a roll  Where every movie  He's the over the top  Rich fucking guy  Really?

Yeah I wouldn't mind kissing her polka dots  Oh Jimmy  Bad sexual innuendo  If there's anything worse than bad 
[01:32:30]  I wouldn't mind drinking out of her coffee cup  What does that mean?  A pussy and a drink out of it?  It's her asshole  And she's got the shits  The squirts  You gotta put your fingers in  And pick it up like a cup  Someone on the line says  Sandler knows his career  Is going in the toilet  That's not true  That's not true  It's not true at all  162 million his last movie made  Yeah he's making tons of money  I mean Zohan did good money  Everything he does  Makes 100 million dollars  Amazing  He's a 20 million dollar  A movie guy  I've liked a few of his movies 
[01:33:00]  Solid  But most of his movies  I don't like  And this one will do  Over 100 million in the end  That's right  The first day  Easily  Easily  Easily  And he produces a lot of them  They're all through his  His company  Yeah yeah  Oh he puts the money up  Although the problem is  That the movies that he produces  That he's not in  Don't make any money  Like the Nick Swartzen movie  That he was in here to promote  May have been the least  Probably is going to end up  Being the least grossing movie  Of the year  So you're saying  He's the draw  He's the box office draw  He's the guy  Did it do poorly  How much 
[01:33:30]  I'd like to look it up  I want to do a movie  Bucky Larson  Bucky Larson  Dead  Horrible  That looked  That looked  So fucking bad  That looked terrific  Oh did that look bad  What did Bucky Larson make  Not good  Not good  What do you mean  Not good  Let's say  It looked hilarious  Sam will pull it up for you  It's lifetime gross  Wait what was your  40 million  Your guess was 40 million  For the whole  For everything though  Yeah  Because it's a low  Okay  Opie stop cheating  You cheated last time  I'm not going to ask you

[01:34:30]  Doing this  Oh  That's the failure part  Oh I see  You understand  Adam Sandler  Was in on the writing  On that one  Is that Nick on the cover  That's him  Let me see  Nick's a funny dude  He is funny  But he plays a character  In this  That just is  It didn't work  Sometimes the movies  Don't  The titles  Don't tell you  Like there's sometimes  A title like  Bucky Larson  You don't know what it is  Sometimes the titles  Have to help a little bit more  Wow  It was  In release  Meaning how long 
[01:35:00]  It was in theaters for  For 14 days  Hours  14 days  Is it a long time or no?  No it's a very short amount of time  Two weeks  Two weeks is a very  Because most theaters  Are obligated to show  A film for three weeks  I think Avatar  Was in the theaters  For three weeks  So  No  Right  It was actually way more  Than three weeks  Oh it was?  I mean it was literally months  Sam if we're going to watch  The trailer  For Jack and Jill  I did see this  And I want to thank  Clue Glooman 
[01:35:30]  From North Carolina  You gotta see the  George C. Scott  Watching the Jack and Jill trailer  Did you see this yet?  Oh I can only imagine  They've been using  The George C. Scott clip  From Hardcore  Yeah  To watch a lot of trailers  Lately  Yeah yeah  That's one of those  Phenomenons on the internet  Turn it off  But the Jack and Jill one's  Okay man  Yeah  So  Also Avatar  34 weeks  Oh  As opposed to two  Two weeks  I don't believe that  Alright well  I mean I guess  Two weeks  I'm working on a song  It's called  Sam Wouldn't Lie  Liar

No  We're going to play  Johnny Cash guy too  For Jimmy  I was thinking about you yesterday  Some fat guy did a cover  That I really like  And I can't remember the song  For Pete's sakes  Oh  Why did you think he rock?  I don't know  Can we see the Jack and Jill trailer  With George C. Scott?  Yeah  Please  Oh  George C. Scott  I'm going to call it a near miss  By the way  Really?  We all love George C.

[01:37:00]  And they're showing the clip  And they cut between him  And the movie theater seat  Which  By the way  He's actually  In the movie  Hardcore  He's watching  His daughter  In a porno movie  The detective that he hired  Found the movie  Right  Got a movie theater  Where just he was sitting  Couldn't he just tell him  That  I found this movie  I'm sure he wanted to see it  Wow  Yeah that's a lot of money  To rent the theater  For one guy  Yeah  So he could see his daughter  I think a guy did him a favor  Or something  Oh okay  And so that's  That's the context  Of George C. Scott  But when you play 
[01:37:30]  A movie trailer like this  And cut out all the  The sex movie parts  It looks like  George C. Scott  Really does not enjoy  Watching this movie  The best part so far  Is when he looked behind him  Like  Is anyone else  In here looking at this shit  Are you kidding me  It's on our Facebook page  Iroch  What's our Facebook page  Opie and Anthony  On Facebook  Alright  We're all over the place  Okay  Back to this  No fighting this year  There's no escaping it  When it's your sister  How we doing  Your twin sister  Are you going bald  Huh  How's wrong

[01:45:00]  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion.  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  It's not a sport. It's not a sport. Go in the water with your fists and punch the fish.  That's a sport. You're standing in a fucking boat. It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger. 
[01:45:30]  This collection is presented on nine full-length, high-fidelity audio cassettes  and will thoroughly convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders and a big gut standing there in 10-degree water  drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon trying to hook some asshole fish.  You're not a sportsman. You're not out there sporting.  Despite what you may think, fishing is not a battle of wits.  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish who has been doing the same thing since dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan. 
[01:46:00]  Do you understand? That fish was no smarter when a Tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street and Broadway.  Put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of Fishing is Not a Sport, you douche.  Narrated by James Norton.  I'm just letting you know, you're not a sportsman.  Hey now, this is D.L. Hughley.  Hey, this is Brewery.  Hey everybody, it's Joel McHale.  Hey, this is Jim Jeffries.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon. You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon. You're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[01:46:30]  Do you like it?  Wow.  Breaking news, Jim Norton's tickets are going on sale, I think, in 48 minutes from right now.  For the 15th.  The 14th is sold out in Atlantic City.  With David Tell.  Artie Lang and Stan Hope and me.  Are we going to get the guys in or what?  I don't know if Artie's allowed to. I don't know what his contract is.  He's doing, I think, Fox Sport.  But we know we can do Dave. He's on the West Coast right now. 
[01:47:00]  We can definitely do him and Stan Hope.  And we would certainly welcome Artie with open arms here.  Yeah, I just don't know if he's allowed to advance.  He goes, I don't know if I can.  I get it.  Tell me, Sid Hayek.  Definitely.  How's he doing? He's doing all right?  Every time I've talked to him, I've talked to him actually a lot. He's been great.  Good. Good for him.  I mean, he's ready to fucking work, man.  He's ready to rock.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, this went around Twitter yesterday.  There's some kid. He looks like a kid, right?  What is that tattoo?  Mid-20s, maybe?  He's a guy.  He's a guy.  His name's Jesse Morris, Sunday morning coming down. 
[01:47:30]  He does a perfect Johnny Cash.  He sounds just like Johnny Cash in an airport. Is that where he is?  I don't know.  That looks like some kind of airport bus stop station in...  That doesn't look like New York.  No, it doesn't look like New York.  San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Oh, BART.  BART system.  Listen to this. It sounds like Johnny Cash.  Telling Johnny Cash.  I woke up Sunday morning with no way to hold my hand.  He looks like him in the face and eyes, too. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, he does.  He's got kind of a look.  And he's doing that with his mouth. He's getting like a snarl.  Well, I washed my face and combed my hair.  Dumbled down the steps to lead the day. 
[01:48:30]  I'd smoke my brain the night before.  We'd pause this.  Cigarettes and some.  How do you not notice this is happening in front of you?  You see all these fucking assholes just...  They've got places to go.  Going through the turnstiles.  They don't even notice that this guy is sounding exactly like Johnny Cash a mere two feet from him.  I mean...  They're busy.  Imagine...  This is why Richard River Phoenix annoyed me.  This guy is capturing his face.  He doesn't look like him.  He's got like blondish, weird, curly hair, tattoos. 
[01:49:00]  He's got some dye on his hair.  It's almost like a red or a pink.  Bizarre looking.  Ooh, papadarza!  Yes.  Luxury item.  Yeah.  Everyone's the same.  They're on a cookie cutter.  Oh!  Say more.  Sam, I'll break your fingers.  It just drives me nuts that these people don't even notice anything around them.  They just barrel through.  Look around.  They should see every day.  Hit it.  I've been picking.  And I lit my purse and watched a young kid cussing. 
[01:49:30]  Out of camp, he was kicking.  As I crossed the empty street, I caught a Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken.  Wait, is there something on his neck?  Is he really saying?  I think...  I think there's a mic.  Oh, okay.  I've been a nervous.  Yeah, he is.  Yeah, he's singing into a mic.  He sounds so much like him. 
[01:50:00]  On a Sunday morning, Sam, why?  Wow.  I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.  Anybody got a joint?  Is there something on a Sunday?  Is he making money?  I would just stand there and miss my train.  There's nothing short of dying. 
[01:50:30]  Wow.  Much life is lonely as the sound.  Of a sleeping city sidewalk.  I would hang out with this guy and just pay him to sing cash while I walk around.  If I pass Sunday morning, I'm coming down.  I got to audition.  Let's walk.  In the park, I saw a batty.  Wasn't laughing.  But I drove.  The train's coming through. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eyes across that empty street once more.  Off somewhere alone, the bell was ringing.  Yeah.  If he got his hair black, he could do like a tribute band or something.  By the way, this is the rest of his life.  Yeah.  This is what he'll be doing. 
[01:51:30]  He'll be doing Johnny Cash Tributes for people who already see him.  I don't see this guy.  Oh, Sunday morning, slide one.  Unless he just did this song.  I wish I'd love it, but I'm a stone.  Is there something in Sunday?  Look at Queen of the Subway is in San Francisco.  Yeah.  Crazy.  That makes the body feel alone.  Thank you.  First person to give him one.  Find there's nothing short of dying. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fox have his lonesome like the sound.  Of a sleepin' city sidewalk.  What a great voice.  On the sound of Sunday mornin' comin' down.  Yeah, he's got that deep resonance.  No, he's great.  He's like, I've had it.  Hi, Mom. 
[01:52:30]  No one gave a shit.  To nothing.  That's great.  No one gave a shit, though.  Does he have other stuff up?  Carolina man goes, not to sound gay, but I have goosebumps.  That sounds just like fucking stuff.  Breaking the law?  What's his name online?  We're going to put it on our Facebook?  He's teasing sick fucking puppies.  No, he's not.  With Jesse Morris?  Do we have a...  Jesse Morris.  E-Rock, we got that on the Facebook yet?  Putting it up.  All right, we'll put it up on our Facebook page.  Wait, can we hear a little Breaking the Law?  I want to hear Johnny Cash sings Breaking the Law, or does he sound like Halford? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, no.  Is that him?  Is this a Johnny Cash song, Breaking the Law?  Or is it Judas Priest?  Yeah, it's Priest.  It is Priest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Breaking the law.  No, I know Judas Priest did Breaking the Law.  I'm out doing things.  Breaking the law.  Stealing from gumball machines and breaking the law.  I'm driving fast.  I'm breaking the law.  I'm talking loud.  I'm breaking the law.  I'm not acknowledging ordinances.  I'm breaking the law.  Sorry. 
[01:53:30]  Go ahead.  Oh, it's another Johnny Cash.  He's the best.  He'd fuck you in the ass. 
[01:54:00]  Why'd that stop?  Fix it.  It was probably just a request someone had.  Sam, fix that.  What else does he have online?  Ruby Tuesday.  Oh, really?  All right.  Buy requests only.  Anybody got any requests? 
[01:54:30]  You're just smoking, hanging out in the fucking subway, panhandling.  You taking requests?  I'm like, yeah.  He's like, could you play far, far away from here?  Ah, that old gag.  Huh?  I had a burger there one time.  Give me food poisoning.  Ruby Tuesday.  What's with this guy? 
[01:55:00]  He looks fatter in this than he did before.  Before they really got found good drugs.  I like this guy.  I think he's really fucked up.  He's great, though.  Yeah, that Johnny Cash.  That Johnny Cash.  That Johnny Cash.  All I want to hear him do is sing Breaking the Law as Johnny Cash.  That's it.  You're going to have to find the full version.  Put it on your phone.  We find him on Twitter?  I don't know. 
[01:55:30]  Let's say hi to Kevin.  Kevin, do you know about this guy?  You know, I just looked him up when we were playing this because I'm psyched he's dead.  What?  He's dead.  There's a posting online.  I looked it up on my phone.  I'm on my phone, I guess.  There's a post on November 8th, someone mourning Funk Rock Johnny Cash.  Ah, fuck.  Are you serious?  My luck.  A little late.  No, we're looking at it now.  The guy we just played, obviously, that Johnny Cash sounded like.  Jesse Morris. 
[01:56:00]  Are you fucking...  What does it say, Jimmy?  As some of you already know, noted San Franciscan street musician Jesse Morris, billed the punk  rock Johnny Cash by some, died this week.  He was 27.  Back in 08, however, Morris began recording a country-tinged album at different Fur Studios.  Sadly, he wasn't able to finish the album.  These songs are results of those sessions, and all proceeds from the sale of this album will  be donated directly to pay for his memorial. 
[01:56:30]  He was a staple at the bar stations, noteworthy for his ink body, style, and stellar voice.  Now it's weird.  Now it feels like I know someone that just died.  I know.  We were getting to know him there.  Listen to the samples.  Go back.  I was getting excited.  I was fast-forwarding my head.  Let's get him to New York.  I hope he's a joke and he's not really dead.  No, it sounds like he's dead.  God damn it, man.  Because he suffered from depression.  He tried to hang himself in September.  Really?  When did he die?  And what did he die of?  How did it happen?  Yeah, they say it's inconclusive right now. 
[01:57:00]  Wait, when did he die?  Sunday.  What?  Sunday.  This week?  Yes.  We found him a week late?  Not even a week.  A couple days late.  A couple of days late.  Come on.  Fuck me.  Anyway.  Yeah.  What?  Let's hear what it was.  This article was published yesterday.  Wow.  Jesus.  God damn it.  Well, maybe that's why I was going around Twitter yesterday, I guess.  All right.  We could have helped this guy, man.  Fuck yeah.  What are some of these original songs or no? 
[01:57:30]  I don't know.  What are the titles?  Maybe we know them.  That makes me sad.  I'm doing time.  Go shove it.  You're gone.  I want to take it all back.  I don't know any of these songs.  Fuck them.  Way to pass the time.  God don't waste my soul.  Bucky's right.  Wow.  Play one.  Yeah, what's this drug related?  Or suicide.  That's pretty funny that you were saying this is the rest of his life.  You were right. 
[01:58:00]  Like a summer wind rolling down loadsome dusty highway.  I keep searching for a freedom I can't find.  Steel bars must reach the ocean.  Steel bars must reach the sky.  Seems like everywhere I go, I'm doing time.  God damn it.  I'm in the set.  Look out.  He's the new Johnny Cash.  What?  He's the new Johnny Cash, but he's dead.  Someone download this for me for free.  Yeah, it's like an album.  Damn, fuck it.  You know, for $5, you could download the whole album. 
[01:58:30]  $5.  That really bums me out.  That's a cool sound, isn't it, Jimmy?  Son of a bitch.  Look how that happened.  Check out You're Gone.  Let me hear You're Gone.  All right.  Yeah, it's fine.  I want to hear that sound.  That's pretty fucking good.  No, let's go through the album a little bit.  It's fine.  I think this is the only sample.  Let's track through it.  This is a Johnny Cash beat.  I woke up, I knew that she'd walked out.  Another man, without a doubt. 
[01:59:00]  And it's my fault, but I'll come gunning just the same.  Pause that real quick.  You know it?  Oh, of course.  I did a...  Fuck.  Give me a minute.  I'll have to fight it.  Is it Johnny Cash?  But wait.  Yeah, that beat.  That fucking...  That guitar.  That sounds really familiar.  Go ahead.  Play it.  It's like fucking puppies.  Powder expels the lead.  I'll put just one in both their heads.  It's not his fault, but I'll gun you both down. 
[01:59:30]  Just the same.  Just the same.  I may not have been good to you.  Stayed gone both day and night.  May have come home drunk and wanting to make love.  But leaving just ain't right.  One, two, three.  You're gone and I don't mind.  You're gone and I don't mind.  No remorse. 
[02:00:00]  No shivers down my spine.  I'm going to listen on my iPad.  I go to Tennessee Flat Top Box.  You're gone and I don't care.  You're gone and I don't care.  It's over, Johnny.  It tickles when they switch on the electric chair.  What a fucking bummer.  The guy's talented, man.  Well, he was.  Man, you know this shit way more than I do.  That's some real talent right there, huh?  Yeah.  Play Tennessee Flat Top Box because you'll hear when it kicks in, the guitar sounds a little  but like we just heard. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Not this, but when it kicks in, the guitar.  Why was he in the subways?  It seems like he could have had a career out there.  Oh, yeah.  That's that beat.  In a little cabaret.  In a South Texas border gown.  Set a boy and his guitar.  Yeah, yeah.  And the people came from all around.  And all the girls.  Fucking Johnny Cash.  From there to Austin.  At least he had fucking 50 years.  We're slipping away from home and put in jewelry and talk to take the trips. 
[02:01:00]  To go and listen.  Wow, that's fucked up.  To the little dark-haired boy.  Let's hear more from this guy, Jesse Morris.  No info, huh?  On how he dropped dead.  Now I need to know about this guy.  I bet it was drugs or depression or something like that.  I'm so bummed.  All I'm thinking of is how great he'd be on the show.  We should get him to play.  I was completely thinking the same thing.  He's in a subway and no one gave a shit.  And he had all that talent. 
[02:01:30]  Might be why.  Yeah, but where were the people that could have helped him out?  I don't know.  God damn it.  Well, he ended up panhandling in a subway.  I guess he didn't have many people.  I wish that was just an internet prank and he's really alive.  Oh, Jimmy.  You think like such a child sometimes.  But the only reason we know about this guy is because he died, I'm starting to think.  Fair point.  I want to take it all back.  Let's hear a little bit of that.  I think I know how this one goes, too. 
[02:02:00]  I want to take it all back.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Indian given.  Boom, boom, boom.  That's how I was singing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Go ahead.  What happened?  Jimmy, you want your copy?  Inner little cab.  I'm going to pay for it.  Fuck him.  Boom, boom, boom.  No, I'm kidding.  Here we go.  I want to take it all back.  Jesse Morris.  I look around and see the records of my past. 
[02:02:30]  It's bad enough.  Sometimes I want to douse myself and gaslight the fire.  I ain't got the spark.  But me and my youth are now sitting there in the dark.  The time I wasted and the money I spent.  Intoxicated now.  Can't make the rent again.  I lied to you and once again I lost the trust.  Breaking your heart with all my drugs, news and love. 
[02:03:00]  I want to take it back.  But I keep breaking down.  I love you so much, baby.  Put myself out in the ground.  For you, I'll lay my bottle down.  I'll lay this burden down.  I'll quit my running around.  I want to take it all back.  I want to take it all back.  Fuck.  I don't know shit, but that's talent right there.  I'm enjoying this guy.  I'm kidding.  The producer got a hold of this guy?  What the fuck?  Instead of the Grim Reaper.  I'll produce your record and he'll follow me. 
[02:03:30]  And he didn't notice the guy was wearing a giant cape.  And a hood and a sickle.  We're all depressed.  We've got to go home early.  Find another one.  We're really depressed.  I mean, I don't know if you can go home.  He would want you to stay.  You think?  Well, at least for 31 more minutes he would.  That's when the tickets go out.  Of course.  What else you got?  God don't want my soul.  Let's hope that's not true.  I hope that's not true. 
[02:04:00]  Big cash imports.  Yeah, yeah.  You think?  Sure.  I actually answered you.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  No, God don't want my soul.  He said it's too damn tattered.  It's jaded and old.  And he threw me out into the freezing cold.  No, God don't want my soul.  No, God don't want my soul.  This is raw, but I really like it.  The devil didn't want to buy my soul. 
[02:04:30]  We talked briefly on the telephone.  He said, hell is full.  Your spirit I can't own.  No, the devil didn't want my soul.  No, the devil don't want my soul.  I'm doomed to walk the earth alone forever now.  People are depressed on this.  I know.  It stinks.  It's because we just met the guy.  We met the guy an hour ago.  We just met the guy, and it's like, oh, shit.  Right.  Wow, this guy's great.  Oh, he died eight minutes ago. 
[02:05:00]  We stink.  I can't pick a winner.  I don't feel this much emotion for my own mom.  I'm just so pumped out.  I didn't care when Johnny Cash himself died.  This fucking parrot kicks over, and I'm miserable.  Oh, Kevin, you're still on the line.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, well, thanks for the info.  Fuck, you just ruined all our days.  He gives you something to think about, like, okay, terrific.  Yeah, man.  There's some raw talent there, heavily influenced by Johnny Cash, but you can also tell he's  doing his own thing. 
[02:05:30]  Fuck.  He had, like, a big career and then a tribute within, like, 20 minutes.  I wanted to hear the fucking...  I know.  The guy's...  He's right.  Our show gave him this big career and then a tribute.  That's the beauty of us.  Thanks, Tonya.  I really want to fucking hear him doing that whole break in the law.  That's the tragedy.  We could break your life down to 20 minutes on this show.  Yeah.  That's what just happened.  Fuck.  Like, hey, this guy's great.  Let's, you know...  This guy, Jason, because we're turning everyone on to this new guy and we're getting excited. 
[02:06:00]  Jason just writes, thanks for nothing, assholes.  Just depressed everybody.  All right.  Maybe we'll play another one into break or something in a little while.  He's dead.  Take it off, guys.  Thanks so much for everything.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  Fucking bad news guy.  You know what?  Why don't we move on to Mike Francesa?  What?  Who has decided he needs to call our show every day now.  And we don't mind, to be honest with you, because we don't know that much about sports.  So to have a sports guy calling in would be great, right? 
[02:06:30]  That is good, yeah.  Mike Gay!  Opie, it's your name is Mr. Norton.  Good morning.  How are you?  Hi, Mike.  Good morning.  How are you?  I wish I was calling on happier terms, but let me just take a second if I can here to  clear the air.  I woke up this morning and my email, or whatever the kids are using nowadays, has blown up.  Apparently, I've used some terms on your show yesterday.  And let me just say, I enjoy doing the morning show, okay?  I used to do the morning show many years ago with the Arnold Dog, okay?  I was doing the morning show when Anthony was knocking it in and I hope he was sleeping on billboards. 
[02:07:00]  Okay?  So I enjoy doing the morning show, okay?  And so apparently, my suggestion to fix the NBA with the firing the nigger comment didn't  go over.  That's true.  It probably didn't go over well.  Right.  Jimmy missed that yesterday.  He wasn't here.  What happened?  Well, Mike Francesa, or this guy that sounds a lot like Mike Francesa, what'd you say?  I said, by the way, very funny, I want to listen to that, okay? 
[02:07:30]  I was up late in the life.  Thank you.  Very funny.  My suggestion to fix the NBA was fire the niggas, hire Mexicans, and you'll see the  losing team to alligators, okay?  Right.  That was your suggestion.  I thought we were in America, you know?  But if I thought you had more than five listeners, I wouldn't have called in with it, okay?  But I would have been a satellite right now.  Racist Francesa.  Racist Francesa.  It's great.  I'm not going to hold you.  I'm not going to hold you forever here.  I'm just going to quickly say I would never offend any different culture, creed, or anything. 
[02:08:00]  I got plenty of niggas, big Jews, to listen to my show, okay?  I wouldn't have been listening to them all.  Oh, Mr. Francesa, you're incorrigible.  Okay.  And the only time I would say niggas was in my living room when the Jets don't cover, okay?  At least he's keeping it sports-related now.  Yeah, Mikey doesn't like the Jets whatsoever.  No, the Jets have been not nice to me, but it's funny.  I didn't even call my show.  I don't need them.  I've been doing it for 25 years, but doing it for none, I was bigger than the Jets for many years, okay? 
[02:08:30]  What do you think about the game this weekend?  Jets-Pats.  Well, I would have to try.  You can't go against Tom Brady.  He's the best quarterback in the world, okay?  He's the best quarterback in the world, okay?  He's the best quarterback in the world, okay?  Tom Brady's the best quarterback in the world, okay?  You know, Belichick and I, you know, we don't really get along that well, but you can't take away from what he's a coach, and Rex is a big mouth, okay?  And if I wasn't so fat, I'd call him fat for myself, but... 
[02:09:00]  All right, once again, a quick quote here, okay?  You want to go out and see Jim Millenari, Lang, and tell all these guys at the Borgato, okay?  I've got you a cup of tea, like I said yesterday, but it's not my kind of humor, but I'm going to plug it because I have a cup of tea, okay?  I don't think it's funny, but, you know, I've had a file joke, so if I've got you a cup of tea, go buy tickets, okay?  Thank you, Mikey.  Thanks, Mikey.  I had three days in a row, I don't want to burn myself out.  Yeah, I wouldn't. 
[02:09:30]  I'm a one-trick pony.  Leave on that high note.  That's a good trick, though.  No, no, I say keep calling.  Oh, no, I don't mean not calling, you know, today.  Yeah, fuck, that's amazing.  All right, so next time you, if you want to put me on one of the kids, do you want to take my phone number, or Anthony, invite me to one of your swank parties out there?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  All right, have a good weekend, boys.  All right, there he goes.  The fake Mike Francesa.  That guy rolls.  I like how he's racist.  That's great. 
[02:10:00]  That's very funny.  Fuck.  That's good.  A lot of impressions today.  Johnny Cash and Mike Francesa.  I know, I want those songs.  All on the same break, okay?  Okay.  We got another one we could play, maybe to break?  I'd do a better Francesa than him.  What was the first one?  Because I was really digging that.  We could play the rest of that to break.  That was called Don't Gerrymander Here.  And who do I give my five bucks to?  I want the whole album.  You can, if you look it up on sfist.com. 
[02:10:30]  Shitfist?  That's what the, S-F-ist, I guess is what it's supposed to be, but sfist.com has the article  on Jesse Morris.  And how to get his music that they're working on?  And it has the link to different fur studios, but I don't know.  It's okay.  It's a little tough, but yeah, you want to go to break with Due in Time?  Was that the one we did?  Yeah, first one.  That was the first one.  Yeah, let's do that.  And then when we get back, Nick Cannon.  Listen, Jesus.  These guys are saying, trust me, we got to play this audio. 
[02:11:00]  Travis is saying, you're saying it, right?  Even the description of what happened, how can it possibly go wrong?  All right, fine.  Nick Cannon launches his co-host dog into the sky.  Listen, how does that...  Jesus.  Do you think it's going to disappoint?  Not this bit.  It's the bit where you do it with the cat, but he went dog.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I guess he was trying to be different by going dog instead of cat.  Has it been done before?  Yes, it was featured on Jocktober, even.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  He has that guy down, man. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Here's the now dead Jesse Morris.  That's not a good way to introduce him.  Well, whatever.  What is this called?  Due in Time.  Due in Time.  One, two, three, four.  Like a summer wind rolling down a lonesome dusty highway, I keep searching for a freedom  I can't find.  Steel bars must reach the ocean, steel bars must reach the sky, seems like everywhere I go

Yes  Well, he told us  What a potty mouth  It's amazing  How anyone can think  That Leno is soft  Like the shit  That he lets me get away with  The fucking  I did a joke 
[02:20:30]  About a dog paw print  On a girl's hips  Implying that she gets  Fucked her dog  That's great  That's awesome  But it's like  It's amazing  That people have  This weird impression  Of the Tonight Show  Yeah  It's like  If you don't like him  That's fine  You don't think he's funny  Alright, that's fair  You got your opinion  On the guy's comedy  Or my comedy  Okay  But to make the judgment  Like, oh, dude  It's all family jokes  Like, oh, you  Dummy  Dummy  John Humphrey in Albany  This is what I was  Getting at  OMG

[02:22:30]  That tells me  You know  Oh, you have to do this  Or have to give to this cause  Like  I'll pick my own  Fucko  I was asking the guy  That was a taxis  Exactly  Exactly  It's another little  Turn  Turn to  I knew what you were doing  Well, listen  I was talking to the guy  And I was like  What was happening  When you went to war  And he said  And the band  Had played  Waltzing  Matilda  Oh, no  And by the way  To the guy that  Twittered me  And said that  Waltzing Matilda  Is about a guy  Running from the cops  It probably is

Yeah, yeah  It was fucking deep, man  Yeah, it was fucked up  Good fucking show  And I'm thinking of that  Because my friend  Jerry Yanez 
[02:24:00]  He's a fucking creep  But he's a cool dude  He's from L.A.  He's the guy  Who has all the pictures  And stuff  Right  He's going to  Harry Morgan's house  What?

Mildred  Mildred  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:26:30]  Mildred  Remember the episode  Where he had the old liquor bottle  And he opened it  With Hawkeye  Oh, yeah, yeah  He's the last of his friends die  Those were some good mash episodes  Yeah  I don't think the humor held up  But I think those moments  The stories held up  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, the humor is just kind of  All right  It's a groucho-ish  Slapstick  Yes, very Marx Brothers  Yeah  And, you know, Hawkeye was supposed to be  A groucho guy  But the acting was so fucking great, man  That's a great show  Yeah  I haven't seen it in a while  No, it's also a great show  What?  This?  Nick Cannon's radio show 
[02:27:00]  Oh, what a segue  Horse hockey  How do we do this one, Sam?  Nick Cannon got in trouble yesterday, huh?  No  He didn't get in any trouble yesterday  He didn't get in a lot of trouble?  Is he getting fired?  No, he's not getting fired  Why are you protecting Nick Cannon?  I'm not protecting him  I'm exposing him, if nothing else  Oh!  Ooh  That's right  It's an expose  That's right  Ooh  Nick Cannon decided to do another hacky bit  Well  Granted, we've done our hacky bits  Well  But that's the point  Over the years  You're not doing 
[02:27:30]  You did  You've moved on from that  Yeah  2011 is not the time to be doing stuff like this anymore  Uh, Nick Cannon  Oh my god, sorry  Claims  Sandusky raped boy at Alamo Bowl  Oh  Now San Antonio's looking into it  Did he rape a kid at the game?  Jesus  He loves little boys  Jesus  Is there any event that he didn't stick his dick in a small asshole at?  Raped at the fucking  At the Vatican  At the changing of the popes  What an ass fucker this guy is  That school's in trouble 
[02:28:00]  Boy, are they  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oof  Three days  Oh wow  Oh my god  So Nick Cannon  What?  Is a dog named Katie Perry?  No  Uh  It was  I don't know where that even came from  I see Nick Cannon hid Katie Perry  Ticks inside  Oh, ticks  Um  He was  Him and his co-host  Sarah Lee  Had a  Pumpkin carving contest  What were you gonna say? 
[02:28:30]  Nothing  Had a pumpkin carving contest on Halloween  That's cute  And uh  If Nick Cannon won  He got to hold on to her dog  And if she won  She gets to watch his  Twins  His kids  Uh huh  Yay  Yeah  As it turned out  It would have been a great contest if we had it with fucking Joe Sandusky  Or whatever Jerry Sandusky  Jerry Sandusky  That's a hell of a bet  At least something's being put at risk  Yeah  You hold the twins 
[02:29:00]  You shish kebab them  And then what happens?  Well as it turned out  Nick Cannon won  Oh  Yeah  He won the contest  That's pretty exciting  So he gets to watch the dog  You understand?  Then what happened?  Right  So then  He had the dog yesterday  Then what happened?  Does this really need this much backstory?  Then what happened?  And he tied balloons to it  Then what happened?  Then the dog floated away  But why would he tie balloons to it?  Alright  Cause he's crazy  Let me  Let me  No one would believe that he's crazy 
[02:29:30]  And his fans do  And no one would believe he's crazy enough to do something like that  This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard  You know we realized  How many balloons it took to lift us up  When we did our bra bombing  That it's impossible  We didn't use fucking helium balloons  We had a dirigible  That's right  Yeah but it was full of helium  That's right  Like how many cubic feet of helium we needed to lift ourselves up  Right  Now I don't think what he was using would be enough  I thought you guys were yelling down at them though  Yeah yeah  And we were you know  We were bra bombing 
[02:30:00]  I don't know what you're talking about Jimmy  People  I don't know what you're talking about  You were yelling at them right  We fucking nailed so many motherhuckers  That we were over that day  Throwing bras filled with water  I would be like  Brother man brother man  Get me another bra  But you would make him steer the dirigible a certain way  Holy shit  Why is this about us now?  How did this turn around so quickly?  The dirigible wasn't going the right way  We took our beating  Turn around this  No no come around again  Oh god  What were we pirate ships?  We were a pirate ship 
[02:30:30]  What's that?  We deserve to be  We deserve to be in miserable relationships  Yeah  We deserved it  Yeah  Now that I think about it  We've been going down that road a little bit lately  We deserved it  That's true  Honestly though  Was there  I don't remember the bit  Was there fucking water in the balloon  In the tits  What was the bra bombing for?  I think we took water balloons  Right  And we put them in the cups of the bra  And then threw the bras out  On top of the people we were flying over  In our dirigible  But were you just bombing the roof of a fucking TV station? 
[02:31:00]  Well  Who was that?  Well  They were looking  We were looking  Satellite dish  We did get that  And they were looking up at us  Yeah  They were outside looking up at us  Well because they took away our TV show  Well why wouldn't you?  And then we had to be on the Spanish speaking channel  Wouldn't you come out of a building  If a dirigible was flying over it  In secured fucking airspace  Around Logan airport?  Wouldn't you want to see what happened?  What a bunch of fucking idiots  Jimmy please let it go  I'm so uncomfortable 
[02:31:30]  He doesn't have any audio  I've seen a lot of people running around  So  I just think  Trying to find it  I just think  What?  I thought he was going to get the audio  What's he doing?  I don't know  I hope not  Where is he?  Why don't we just go to the Nick Cannon stuff  I know  Where is he?  What's he doing?  He might be looking for it  Oh boy  He's yelling now  He's bent over  We're yelling into my headphones  Instead of on the air again  So Sam  Where are we?  So Nick Cannon decided to get crazy  And the dog went airborne  With helium balloons 
[02:32:00]  Yeah  And then they wanted people to let them know  If they see the dog floating by  And somebody  I'm sure not associated with the station  Posted a video  Because they saw the dog  If you want to watch this video  Oh there's a dog floating video?  I mean it was  One of the guys just came in with a fucking  That's Sal  You just met him  Oh Sal  What?  Is that Sal?  Yes  I have no idea who that is  Actually I looked at him the other day  When I was walking in  And I went  Sal?  He goes yeah  A young John Cusack 
[02:32:30]  Yes  He came in and handed Ovi the disc  Which I assume would be the bra bonding  And Ovi didn't even look him in the eye  Or look at the disc  He grabbed it and threw it over his shoulder  I was only curious as to what  Like if there were people outside  Jimmy we did this  I love that Jimmy  Like I was only curious  There's a legitimate reason I want to hear this  Aside from just mocking you  I think we're in agreement with the listeners  They don't like when we pound things into the ground  Oh wow  I agree  They really don't  No I agree  They really don't  Fair enough 
[02:33:00]  I gotta know something  About this Nick Hanna thing  Did they use some type of computer wizardry  To show a dog floating?  No  What did they do?  Use a stuffed dog?  Oh boy  Are you kidding?  And there's video of it?  And people bought into this?  Yeah they really did  No they didn't  Absolutely did  I mean  People bought into this  People are dumb  That's why you're not part of the 1%  150% I'm sure  You're too stupid to be part of the 1%  No  Because I was getting it on my Twitter last night 
[02:33:30]  From his fans  Who all bought into it  I wouldn't think that anybody would have bought this  Yes  They were playing along too right?  Nobody was playing along  People aren't that stupid  Yes they are  I don't want to think that people are that stupid  Well they are  What are you doing Jimmy?  Pulling a nose hair  It hurts  It does  Sometimes a curly nose hair gets in there  And goes  On the inside of your nose  And you grab it  And just yank it out  You gotta stop breathing for a second  No  You just get a giant teardrop  Coming out of one eye  And you gotta sneeze  It's like giving Sandusky 
[02:34:00]  Yeah  Sometimes that shit gets infected though  Sandusky  Oh really?  Oh yeah  Well you gotta have a good immune system  Sometimes  Let me see what happens  I wanna see the dog  I wanna see the video  Come on  Do they show it?  The video is from way below  And then there's some pictures of them launching the dog  Oh okay  Alright let's see  So here's the video  And you can hear the genuine voice behind it  Oh I bet  Alright the camera's up in the air  Oh my god 
[02:34:30]  I see some balloons  There's a dog up there  What?  That's how they know  Great acting  Yeah how do you know?  It's like  The dot in the sky  Where's the dog?  Can't see  Anything  Why don't they zoom in?  Oh because we'll see  It's a stuffed animal  Exactly  And you know what kind of balloon you would need  To lift a dog  That's a dog on the balloons up there  On the balloons?  Asshole  What's going on?  Do you guys know what's going on?  Oh boy 
[02:35:00]  A dog on the balloons  Dog on the balloons  Somebody's had a dog to the balloons  How come the parking guys couldn't see that it was a dog  But the guy taking this video  Yeah yeah  He's trying to sell them  It's going up up up  Now the guy has no improv skills  Poor dog  So he's just sitting there with a stupid camera  And a dot in the sky  With a dot in the sky  Hey  You see the dog?  He was hoping everyone else would do the work around him  On the balloons  No one gives a shit 
[02:35:30]  No  This is the most uneventful video I've ever seen  It's horrible  It's accelerating at a ridiculous rate  I'm watching clouds  A dog would not fucking go that high up with so small of balloons  It's going to strap to Spudnik  Is that it?  Yeah  That's it  And now some still pictures I guess  See the concept isn't bad  If you get a guy that can fucking pull off the acting  And then here's the problem  Then they're not brave enough to follow the bit through right?  They all got scared?  They got very scared  Fucking idiots  Because first they tried to make it seem like they were getting in trouble 
[02:36:00]  And then the listeners  Much like the Aston Kutcher thing  The listeners started actually getting upset  They didn't want to hear it  They don't like things like that  Oh that's when you keep the bit going for a while  Oh god what an idiot  Yeah we know just how long to keep a bit going  Right until they throw your ass out the door  You're not going to get fired for something like this are you?  No  No way  How could you?  So what those are the  That's what?  That's a dog  Attached to the balloons  Where? 
[02:36:30]  I don't see no fucking dog  That's the dog  A bunch of balloons  Where's the dog Jimmy?  Where's the dog?  It's under the balloons floating  I don't believe it  He's in the dog house now right?  And then they went so far as to  Know what I've been thinking about lately?  The prank calls that used to come in at AF  Oh yeah  The mix station  Mix 98.5  Remember the one with the turkey?  Because Thanksgiving is right around the corner  I'm going to get a turkey  I'm going to stuff it  And I'm going to cook it 
[02:37:00]  That's a crazy old broad  Calling our stupid show to win a free turkey  A bunny ball  So what's going on?  Since they were in such trouble  They decided to post posters around the city  Announcing they had lost a puppy  Nick Cannon lost a puppy  Put the station logo on the flyer  And of course the phone number goes to  That's the number that Nick announced as his actual  Cell phone  Right  Home phone number  But the phone was just given to him by the company 
[02:37:30]  Well it's not a phone  It's an electronic voice answering system  Oh it's not even  No it's not a phone  An actual phone doesn't even ring  No it doesn't  You know the idea itself isn't bad  And as long as you're brave enough to pull it off  You got to follow through  You got to get the video camera guy  It has to be someone that's very believable  And they should have went to a place  That had a lot more fucking people to work off  Exactly  Where were they?  I don't know  You had two fucking guys  Two fucking guys  Hoping that they were going to  You know  He only had one shot at it too  Because there's the balloon in the fucking sky  Whatever  Hey look at that balloon  Hey we didn't know 
[02:38:00]  Oh thanks  And why is the video  The dog on that balloon  Ha ha ha  The video is of one balloon  And then the still pictures are of a lot of them  Well maybe the perspective from so far below  That's true  He was way above  He was going through the earth's atmosphere  Yeah  And then Sam got involved with this whole dumb thing  Nick and I were tweeting back  Now you're pals or something  Don't be pals with that guy  He's a hack  I interviewed him  He was not a bad guy to talk to him  He's a good TV  I'll be honest  America's got talent  I like watching him on that  But this radio thing is not going to pan out for him 
[02:38:30]  I mean  When we talked to him  He's horrible  On the after show  He answered every question legitimately  I know he did  You know  He answered respectably  Fair enough  Fair enough  What did he say?  Yes I am a hack  Fair enough  Fair enough  He admitted that some of the bits were not great  And to having the talent coach  But I mean you know  He fessed up to it  But then that's why I tweeted him  Because we talked about this  I didn't think he was going to be doing bits like this anymore  But before that 
[02:39:00]  Because he started tweeting  Uh oh  I think I'm getting fired  Which immediately I knew was a falsity  It was not true  So I ran  And I ran tape  On the end of his show yesterday  So we could hear the emotion in his voice  As he got scared  That uh oh  The bosses were very upset  Because PETA was calling  You understand  Nick apologized at the end of his show  For a prank on that  Good thing  How long did the prank last? 
[02:39:30]  He called in to the afternoon show yesterday  After he had launched the dog  Quote on quote in the morning  He called in to the afternoon show  They didn't even last a day  Before they got scared?  What faggot lawyers  Yes  What pussy lawyers  It's the same lawyers  I know what it is  I know the names  They never got rid of the lawyers  As the whole radio fucking business is destroyed  They continue to keep the guys  That kind of  These fucking pussies  Kind of fucked it all up  Hey say you're sorry  Why?  Why can't you wait till the next morning? 
[02:40:00]  Say you're sorry right now  This is bits out of control  Say you're sorry  We don't need any legalese  Say you're sorry  Could we have Bobo do this for real  With his dumb dog  Mr. Maloonigans  Mr. Maloonigans  Would he be willing to do that?  To get back on the show?  Yeah I would think so  For the show  For the show?  I would hope so  It's not that big of a sacrifice  It's Mr. Maloonigans  For god's sake  For the show 
[02:40:30]  Here's Nick Cannon  Being a scaredy cat  Can't go with the bit  No no no  This is going  This is fake apology  Going with the bit  Saying uh oh  We really launched the dog  Oh he's still going with the bit  Yes  He stopped going with the bit  Yesterday afternoon  This was yesterday morning  Still trying to convince people  That he was in trouble  Okay here we go  New York's new 92.3 now  No  Let's play our fucking bra bombing  Alright you can't do it 
[02:41:00]  With the fake  That's right  He's acting  I just have to let everyone know  That I am a dog lover  A lot of time  On the show  I try to pretend like  I don't like dogs  I have seven dogs  So all these text messages  And people calling  Saying I'm being cruel to animals  I apologize  It was just  It was  A radio bit  That went a little too far  Sarah Lee  Ran out of here 
[02:41:30]  Hysterically  Because  She saw her  Dog floating  By balloons  We have eyes on the dog  So it's  I believe it's  It's going to  Go  Alright  We're going to  See what's happening  But I do have to  Apologize to my co-host  And hopefully  She's alright  And we're going to  We're going to get the dog down  This could possibly be  The last  Time I'm on the radio  Because I can  Already seeing all these 
[02:42:00]  Emails and stuff  Coming through  So  I  Apologize  I wasn't trying to be mean  I wasn't trying to upset anybody  I know people are in their cars  Crying  And hysterics  And everything  But  See I like Nick Cannon there  Because he's fucking  Making it seem like  There's more to it  At least he's fucking  Pushing it a little bit  And these  Fucking  Glasses  Wearing  Jizz  Buckets  These fucking  No talents  Jizz buckets  Fucking no 
[02:42:30]  You better tone the bit back  The bits  Get too far  You better tone the bit back  What do you think  What do you think  Dan  I don't want to  To tone the bit back  I don't want to do the advertisers  We don't want the  1-800 cars for kids  People getting upset  Tone the bit back  I think it was  877  Whatever the fuck it is  He's still fucking  Assholes  I'm an attorney  I say  The legalese  To tone the bit back  I don't want to  Go Buster Brown  I've been destroying 
[02:43:00]  Radio shows  Long before you  Were on them  Fucking  Cocksucker  I had to clunk  The fucking heads together  The spy  Clunk  I really do  I hate the  Fucking guts  Of those attorneys  What a weak  Station manager  Who's that  What fucking  Simp  Is running  That fucking  Station  I don't know  We're out of time  At this point  I have no idea  What fucking  Marshmallow spine  Simp  Is running  That fucking  Shithouse  Our worst 
[02:43:30]  Call  Shut us down  See so the original  Thing was to try  To convince people  That he was  Gonna get fired  Cause he was  In real trouble  For this  Right  And then the station  Must have felt like  They didn't want  Their listeners  To get that upset  Right  Come on  Why do that  Our whole job  Is to fuck  With the listeners  Yeah  Yeah  It's been our lives  For way too many years now  Well that station  Doesn't want to do that  Sorry  Sorry to the people  They're not 
[02:44:00]  They don't like that  Then don't do  This type of radio  You can't go half in  Not even half in  The bit didn't even  Make it a day  So what's the next track  We got Nick  And his producer  Agree they can handle  It off the air  Yeah cause they gotta  Talk to the bosses  Now  Ah boy  There's a joke  That's going bad  Actually  I have my producer  With me right here  Ryan  Who's  Honestly man  I'm  I'm not trying to  Place blame or anything 
[02:44:30]  But  I thought it was  A good idea  When we were  Joking about  Sarah Lee's dog  Like maybe to give it  A haircut  Or  You know  Even to dye it  Or whatever  Like how they dye  Some of the dogs pink  But  You  You  Wanted to do  This balloon thing  We all did  We all thought  It was  You know  It was playful  And fun  And it's just  It's something  That we got  Carried away with  I mean  I got too much  We meant to do this  Indoors  It was your idea  To do this  And like  Just trying to be  Funny in the morning  And I got it  Anyways  Listen  Our boss

[02:50:30]  I need  Q-tips  And Vaseline  Can I tell you guys something?  Sure  I admitted the other day  You know  I got PS3  And the only game I played  Is Tiger Woods  Yeah  I don't know why I do this to myself  It doesn't  It doesn't help my image  What happened?  I only have one controller  And it's on purpose  Because I don't want to play with anyone  You want to see it all loose?  Or you want to  No because I'm really into Tiger Woods  Like ridiculously good at it  Yeah  I know that's a little bragging there 
[02:51:00]  And I apologize  But then people come into your life  Like oh Tiger Woods  It seems fun  I want to play  And I don't want to sit through their nonsense  Of getting 12s on holes and stuff  Has anyone ever come in and said  Oh you want to play?  Yeah I swear to god  And you're like oh I only have one controller  And I say I only have one controller  And that's it  Yeah  I don't have to play with the  I have two controllers  And I've never used the second one  Yeah I know  Do you hide it?  I really don't need a second controller  No because I always have one charging  And one ready to go  My second controller is just a battery one 
[02:51:30]  Yeah  Have Sal pick Opie up another controller  Sal!  No  No no no no  And people get mad at my family  And I'm like it's not fun for me  I don't want to play with anyone  I never do play with anyone  I don't need a second controller  I hate playing video games with other people  Unless they're really good too  At that particular game  I play Tiger Woods with other people  Do you?  Do you win or lose?  It's split 50-50  Ah you lose sometimes  The wife's good  Yeah she's good  Yeah  Nice  You get beat by a girl sometimes?  Well I mean if you want to look at it that way  Ouch  Sam Vibe Girl 
[02:52:00]  What's Vibe Girl all about?  Vibe Girl is the show that comes on after Nick Cannon  Thank God  And so since this was such a big station controversy  Because there was a real dog in the sky  Vibe Girl had to keep the thing going  And once again people believe there was a real dog in the sky  Because of Nick Cannon huh?  A hundred I swear yes  Yes I can confirm this  That's fucked up  I cannot believe Nick Cannon  I just found out what happened to Mark Charlie Rue  What?  Anything happens to that dog  What?  He better watch out for me 
[02:52:30]  Do not mess with an angry pregnant woman  I will get him  Vibe Girl it's 92-3 now  Let's go  You know how easy you can fight a pregnant woman?  What is she talking about?  One kick in the gut and it's over  Yeah that's all you gotta do  You plant your foot there  Like if you come up real hard  A lot of times it kills them too  See  Chip you didn't have to get so fucking graphic  No but a lot of guys kick straight into the belly  You gotta come up kick  Like you're kicking a kickball or something  Or a football  Holy shit  That pushes the blood up into the heart 
[02:53:00]  You gotta up kick  Because that not only kills the fetus  The mother will die too  What the fuck  And she'll fall down the steps  Chip man that's fucking ruthless  I'm just telling you  Because a lot of guys will just do a side karate kick  Or something  But that allows the mother to walk away  And you don't want that?  I'm just telling you how to do it  I didn't say you should do it  Alright okay  But you should always kick up  In a swooping manner 
[02:53:30]  Okay  I hear you  Make a big kicking noise  That's the noise I make  When I kick up in a swooping manner  Sambo  So where are we at now  With this Nick Cannon  Launching the dog in the sky  Bit that they weren't brave enough  To actually do  After they  Pre-planned the whole fucking thing  It's just such a horrible  They had posters made  Yeah  They decided okay  We're gonna have a guy with a video camera  That obviously knows how to act  On the street 
[02:54:00]  He's gonna get one of those videos  That video's gonna go viral  The media's gonna pick up on that  And then  It was all a bust  Because the lawyers said  Oh fuck no man  It's a horrible bit  Too much attention is being paid  To this radio station right now  We can't do this anymore  It was a horribly fake bit  To begin with  And then they couldn't even  Stick with it in the end  You don't want Peter to get involved  That's all we need to do  Is all of a sudden  As attorneys  To have to fail the phone  To do our jobs  We don't need any of that  We're attorneys  Well at this point 
[02:54:30]  Nick Cannon  I started  Because Nick Cannon  Was tweeting  Peter is getting upset  I think I'm gonna lose  My radio job  He was faking  He was lying the whole time  Of course  And so that's when  I started tweeting him  Nick  We talked about this  When you were on the show  I thought you weren't gonna do  Any fake bits  And bad radio anymore  And then I tweeted him  A couple other things  Like somebody said  Why is Nick Cannon  Getting fired  And I tweeted back  For doing his show  I just took a couple shots 
[02:55:00]  Yeah  And then all of a sudden  Next time I looked at my Twitter  Nick Cannon had tweeted  If anybody has any problems  With the bit I did  With the dog today  Contact my producer  Not Sam  It was all his idea  And then he said  Some talent coach  You are not Sam  Hashtag Radio Genius  My ass  And so he threw him  Back in my court  Which I actually thought  Was very funny  And did you get any replies  I got a ton all day  People in Nick Cannon's camp  And then 
[02:55:30]  You know  Were they fake tweets though  Just going along with it  No they weren't fake tweets  They were his listeners  I looked at their profiles  They really thought  How many  They really thought  That this bit was going on  And it was your fault  Because you were the producer  Yeah  I got dozens of tweets  All day long  How many followers  Does he have  He has almost 3 million  He has 2.9 million followers  Yeah he's got a lot of followers  He's a TV guy though  America's Got Talent  That is a big fucking show  Almost 3 million  And so is it Howard's  Going to join that show  That's the rumor  I believe that's just  His PR machine  Of course  Rumored to be hosting 
[02:56:00]  American Idol too  What's PR  I don't know PR  I don't get PR  That's dumb  Who needs PR right  PH is the best  Paul Hoggess  Oh  Sorry I'm doing  Carriages too much  I'm just really sleepy  But you did treat yourself  After the Leto appears  Oh I fucking sure did  I'm a little concerned  By the pre  Cum  Yeah  Well you like treating yourself  But now you're pre  Treating yourself  Before you even  Even do the  Task at hand 
[02:56:30]  Right  That allows you  To treat yourself  I want to try a sound here  Yeah  Bear with me  Jimmy  Jimmy just put a newspaper  Down by his pants  And one sheet of newspaper  And farted into it  Hoping it was like  Like a paper and a comb  Yeah  Hoping something would happen  But it really wasn't  A great experiment  It was a dud  Oh god  It doesn't stink though  No I bet it will  I can't  I can't  By the way  A lot of people  Referencing the time  That good old 
[02:57:00]  Dale Schaefer  Was Ramoned by Jimmy  For doing the  Kitten in the Basket  Oh god  Radio bit  Right  I just want to acknowledge  The people that remember that  Yes  Good old Dale Schaefer  Remember Dale  Dale Schaefer  That's uh  Wow that was  Five  Six years ago  Jesus  Time flies here  That was six years ago  Dale Schaefer  We were not kind to  No  Whatever happened to  Good old Dale Schaefer  Dale Schaefer  I don't know  I don't care  I don't either  He's hanging out with  Pete Schlitz  Oh boy 
[02:57:30]  Oh boy  He's barely holding on  I love this  I know he's by his  Fingernails  I love this version of Jimmy  This entire man  He's standing up  Because he knows  He's going to fall asleep  If he sits anymore  I know I got to finish  Packing and go to Long Island  Nick Cannon launches  This is his co-host  Dog into the sky  So finally the last clip  Sam  Thank god  So you got involved  His listeners were tweeting you  His listeners were all tweeting me  And it was also  Real shit  Because they were really pissed off  Did you have any of those tweets?  Yeah I got a ton of them  And they were saying things like  First they were tweeting Nick saying 
[02:58:00]  Did they just leave the show?  He had to pee  He's got to make wee-wees  Oh okay  You know that bladder of his  Hey if not Sam told you to jump off a bridge  Would you do it?  And then like all this insane stuff  But they were saying that both Nick and I  Should be ashamed of ourselves  Oh  And they meant it  Yeah  I'm going to keep saying that  Because I'm amazed that people are that dumb  This is where the revelation came in  That people will go  It's those people that are going to go see Jack and Jill this weekend  I know  You know  We're in a dumb world  They're not smart individuals 
[02:58:30]  And then like a couple people were arguing about whether or not it was a joke  I mean it was just  Just that that would be an argument  It's so stupid  Alright well we can play the last clip  Sure  Nick releases a video later in the day admitting it was a hoax  So they don't even last a day with this answer  No no  And this video was obviously filmed  Right after it happened  And it was the sort of trapped like escape route  Like okay if this gets too carried away  We got to have this video on standby 
[02:59:00]  Oh they had it ready  Ready to push  And so he called into the afternoon show  I read about it  I don't have the audio  But he called into the afternoon show  To admit that he still had the dog  And then he put this video out on the website  Alright so  I want to bet with Sarah Lee  And I'm about to play the meanest joke on her ever  The whole time I've been acting like I don't like dogs  When I really love dogs  A dog person  People already know that  But  Pretending like I don't like this one  And that I want to float Charlie Rue  The cutest dog ever 
[02:59:30]  With balloons  I'm not really going to float a dog  That would be horrible and mean  I'm going to float a stuffed animal  That looks just like Charlie Rue  And if you happen to find  The fake stuff Charlie Rue  Attached to it  Be some Katy Perry tickets  Courtesy of New York's new 92.3 net  This is going to be fun  Right Charlie?  We're going to put you in a nice  Safe place  Not you  We're putting you in the sky baby 
[03:00:00]  So what?  The fake dog?  Like a stuffed animal?  It's a stuffed animal  And there's tickets you can win  It's just so stupid  It's a ticket promotion  But I mean  He's a likable guy  I do enjoy him  I'll say it on America's Got Talent  But this radio thing  Jesus  And every interaction I've had with him  Has been awesome  Because he actually acknowledges  On some level  Like he knows  He knows  The fact that he was tweeting me  Back when he was tweeting me  He knows how dumb his listeners are  Oh okay  On some level he's aware  That's kind of good  How stupid these people are  But he's just 
[03:00:30]  He's roping him along  As long as he's aware  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  You missed the conclusion of the  Oh man  Look at the end of murder-suicide  That was terrific  Look at all these  And they're all girls  That's how I know  They're not Opie and Anthony fans  They're all tweeting me  We're getting some girls  There's a few  We got a few  Find that dog  Exclamation, exclamation  And never own a pet  You have serious issues  This is absolutely not funny  You better find that dog  How dare you  Somebody  The dog would be dead  Somebody said it was a joke  To which another guy replied 
[03:01:00]  You're stupid  It really flew away  Not funny of a joke at all  Had many people scared  And sick to their stomachs  Over this  Not right  So the bit's perfect  Keep it going  Nah you want to cut it off  It's  You know  It's a little few  Too many tweets there  Getting a little negative  You're the one  Who sent the dog up  Nick Cannon  Not Not Sam  Take some responsibility  Pound you disgust me  You know what  You got your little bump now 
[03:01:30]  It's time to cut it back  You know  You don't need the advertisers  Pull back  You read this  Leave him  Leave him something else  Leave him like  Leave him wanting more  Jimmy took it from fun to real  That's what they do though  We've heard all this stuff  Oh yeah  For bottom  Wonderful  Um  Nick Cannon  If Not Sam instructed you  To jump off a bridge  Would you do it?  It's your fault  You can't blame someone else  For what you did  Exactly  Somebody with passion  They all think there's a dog  Flying in the sky  Yeah  On balloon  Brilliant  My reply to Nick Cannon 
[03:02:00]  Was that I had advised Nick  To stop tweeting  And that if you would excuse me  I have a flying dog to find  Yeah  Well you should have said  Something about  I would have tied in Sandusky  With the whole thing  And saying like  You know  You made it funny  Nick just  He was too busy  He's actually donating money  To Jerry Sandusky  Because he feels that  This whole thing  Has got to stop  This persecution  This man  That everyone should be allowed  To make love to who they want to  You'd have gotten a direct message 
[03:02:30]  So quick  Knock it off man  Knock it off man  Come on  We at 93  93 now  93 now  Want to help  Jerry Sandusky  In these false charges  I'm glad of all these false charges  He almost tried a bit  Let's see how they  Hog it in Queens  Hey Opie  I haven't played  Tiger Woods in a while  But isn't that one of those games  Where you can play

[03:03:30]  This has nothing to do with  The First Amendment  Or your protests  Blah blah blah blah  Yeah someone shot in the  Oakland Occupy area  Because some people are saying  That the person that died  Wasn't actually part of the movement  But he was close to where  They were hanging out  Yeah  So  But that's  That's enough for the mayor  The mayor's like  We have to shut this down  Yeah  So they're trying to figure it out  And we said  This is what it would take  To shut it down  Well they're pretty rambunctious  Over there  They're the ones that  Light shit on fire  Yeah  They gotta be  Gassed  They get the tear gas out

[03:07:00]  I want to be here  How many times  I'm going to say that  He heard you  That boring I am  I bet there's great folks  Eatin' from a fancy  Died of cars  The wrong  Rating of coffee  And smoking big cigars  Well I know I had it done  I know I made me free  By the way  I love the fact  That's Johnny Cash

[03:12:00]  I love fucking desserts  I vicariously eat dessert  Through Jimmy  You have an amazing spoonful  I've always noticed that  About you  Yeah  I know I have a spoonful  Because I think  He tells himself  I only want one spoonful  So he makes it count  You make it count Jimmy  Yeah I do  Oh wow  That was fast  The Xbox is back  Would you have one  In the fucking back?

How much pressure's on  Actually it's the change  Whoa  It's like 65 bucks  Or something  Yeah  That's a good tip  Thank you sir  That's a great tip  You know why?  Because I sent him out  For something  Yeah  Came back promptly  With the correct  Fucking merchandise  Do you ask for anything  More than that?  That's you  Putting people to work  You're right  Exactly  You provide income 
[03:13:00]  To people  That's what I do  See?  I agree with you now  See?  Now I could play  Fucking Call of Duty  At Compound East  West  Very good  And Central  Is it going to rain later?  What's the matter?  I like to look up  At the rain  Edgar  Sometimes I stand  At the water fountain  Just let it  Cascade over my  That sounds very dry 
[03:13:30]  Edgar  Very dry  They used to hold me down  And call me  Balloon T  Who would do that?  Older boys  Jimmy would you have  Jesse Morris play for you  If you had the opportunity?  I wanted to say it again  I would just ask him  It makes you feel good  So just say it again  I would ask him  To play The Wall  A lot  And 
[03:14:00]  Fuck all these songs  Man  Tennessee Flattop Box  I'd have him learn  All the hard shit  Like Life Goes On  That's an old one  That's really old  Where he said something  About being gay  Like being happy  Life Goes On  Him and his girl  Break up  Him and his gal  Life Goes On  I don't remember how it goes  Life Goes On  Fuck  I forgot  I love that  Johnny Cash day today  Come on  Is there anything better  Than Johnny Cash?  Yeah  Fucking  No 
[03:14:30]  My baby left me  Just the other day  Fuck I got dumped  Yeah  I guess the things  Will never be the same  I keep my eyes wide  Open all the time  Because you're mine  I walk the line  Make it glance  Train a-coming  It's rolling around the pen  Right at the moon  Right we get it  That I'm a man  It's hard to do 
[03:15:00]  But I must try  Cause life goes on  And so will I  There's a  There's a reason for these songs  It's like if you're  You're a story guy  You like the story behind the song  I love stories  I like the sound of songs  I could give a shit  What they're saying  And I like the sound too  Yeah  I hope Chris could be trusted  Uh oh  Quote from PETA's statement  About the Nick Cannon thing  He got involved  Even though there was  Nothing to get involved with  Had it been true 
[03:15:30]  Nick would have had PETA  To worry about  And that's far worse  Than going to Rikers Island  How about it wasn't true  So who cares  Yeah so why don't you  Just relax  Who gives a turkey  Shut it  Stop trying to act  Like you have big forces  Bunch of fucking dummies  Forced to be reckoned with  Either I like PETA  I shouldn't shit on them  I like them  No  I do  They're stupid  They're too radical  But I like the way  They stick it to those  Rich motherfuckers  With their fur coats  Who wears fur anymore 
[03:16:00]  Exactly  No one because of them  The housewives  They like their furs  They throw green paint on you  Have some green paint you  I've always wanted  To throw paint on a fur  I've wanted to throw paint  On anything  I want to throw paint  On a fucking  On a nun  On a person  Feeding the homeless  I want to throw paint  On myself  On a chick with a big clit  You name a person  Or a thing  I want to throw paint on it  How much trouble  Would you get  If you threw paint  On a fire  Thank you  I don't know  It's probably considered  Some type of battery  Really  And then 
[03:16:30]  No you couldn't use that  To charge anything  Just more CDs  It's a harassment  Yeah  And then you'd get  Some kind of civil penalty  To replace it  That's easy shit  You want to hear a statement  Yeah  If bad taste were a crime  We'd be going to jail  With Nick  But joking about  Killing a dog  A kid  An old person  Anyone  Isn't cool  When there's always  The danger that  Some numbskull  Will do it for real  Shut up  You fucking  Bunch of douchebags  By then it means you  So you can't joke  About anything  Because some idiot  Might actually do something 
[03:17:00]  Right  That's our society now  Don't do anything  Don't talk about it  Don't joke about it  Because someone out there  Might do it  Well the truth of the matter  Is people will do it anyway  Because they're fucking lunatics  And by the way  Can we joke about things  Peter covers themselves  In blood  So I guess what they're saying  Is they shouldn't do that  Because some lunatic  Yeah  Anyone who mimics a joke  And does it  Has misinterpreted the joke  So some lunatic  May misinterpret  What they're doing  And cut themselves  And stand in the store window  Right  So I guess you should  Stop those tactics  Peter  Somebody may take 
[03:17:30]  You throwing paint  On somebody seriously  And throw it  In somebody's face  See what I mean  See how easy it is  To get caught up  In that nonsensical thinking  Shut up  God  That totally reminds me of  Steven Singer  Yeah  What  Steven Singer  That reminds me of  Steven Singer  In Argentium  People whose face  We want to throw paint in  Argentium  I would throw paint in his face  No  Steven Singer's got a  Super Silver collection  I'll take the soup  Steven Singer's brand new

[03:25:00]  For Anthony  And you got back here in time  So congratulations  Thank you very much  My first day of interning  For the Opie and Anthony show  And I'll tell you this  The After Show is brought to you  By Trojan Bearskin Condoms  Trojan  America's  Number one  Most trusted condom brand  But my first day  As an intern  For the Opie and Anthony show  I  Sam Roberts  Was sent  To get Anthony a video game  So I know  I know what you went through  It was before Best Buy was here 
[03:25:30]  So it wasn't  I had to go to a couple places  I ended up in a circuit city  I ended up here  Circuit city  I know  To young guys like you Sal  You go  What's a circuit city?  FYE  Well what are you talking about?  A circuit city was an electronic store  That went out of business a few years ago  But I was  You remember FYE right there by this?  Yes I remember FYE  But I was all over the place  Trying to find this PC game  And I finally found it  But  I got back at like 10.02  They were off the air by the time I got back 
[03:26:00]  Anthony was still generous  I'll never forget  But that's why I was  I was trying to find out how much he tipped you  Because I remember when I went  To get the game  I guess it just happened to be the change  But he gave me I think  Either 15 or 20 dollars  That's pretty good  You walked out of here with 65  No 64, 51  Oh you got the receipts  64  Nice  I need  20 of that  You need 20 of that?  Yeah  I'm going to have to ask you for 20 of it 
[03:26:30]  You know I was actually warned  By Travis  Uh huh  That I don't need to buy you lunch today  You need to buy  That's a great idea  I'm glad Travis brought that up  Eric what are you doing for lunch?  Uh nothing  What Troy?  What about Sal?  I mean what about Matt?  Come in  Come in Troy  I mean I have no problem with  I've got great news  Sal just made the announcement  I don't know if you were listening today  You should have been  Because you work here  God damn it  But I don't know if you were listening today  Sal  Received a very generous tip from Anthony 
[03:27:00]  I did know  Yeah  Uh after he got the Xbox thing  Anthony gave him 64 dollars  And 51 cents  And 51 cents  Yeah  Lunch for everyone is on Sal  Winnie's day  Whoever wants it  Sal's going to pick it up  Oh dude thanks man  That's really cool  Yeah I appreciate that  And so that's nice  Paul  I meant the people who are here five days a week  So for now you won't be  You're going to dig in the ass  You won't be getting the lunch  That's a shame  I mean that's what you meant Sal  Right  The fivers  The five day a week  The lifers  I was the one who told Sal  In the first place  To not buy you anything  How about anybody who wants it 
[03:27:30]  Who didn't sleep in the office last night  Whatever  I'm dedicated to my job  Three days a week  You're dedicated to your job  Yeah  So wake up early in your house  And drive to it  I wouldn't have made it here on time  But then you're not terribly dedicated to your job  Are you  I slept here  I caught you in a little hole there  No I slept here  If you're dedicated to your job  Then you would be able to sleep at home  And then wake up  And then come to work  Never would have made it here on time  We got to work this morning  And Paul was sleeping in Eric's office 
[03:28:00]  In the Nagel chair  Right  In the nap chair  He was asleep this morning  And he was so passed out  That Travis was like  Kind of stroking him  And giving him a nice like  Good morning sweetie pie  And there was nothing  No response  He was out huh  Yeah for a second  We thought we were going to have to call medical  Because obviously  He had some kind of alcohol poisoning  But he did eventually come to  Were you drinking last night?  What did Mars say to him?  Oh and Mars tried to draw a penis on his face  But that's when he started to stir  So he woke up with like the beginnings 
[03:28:30]  Of a Spanish penis drawn  I'm sorry  A Hispanic penis drawn on his face  Went at a crazy night last night?  No not too  Too nuts  Well I mean it was nuts enough  That he came in here in the middle of the night  And then fell asleep  No I just knew if I went home  I would have slept until 6, 7 o'clock  And been late  So I just decided to drive here and sleep instead  Sleep here instead  I also got work done last night  You did?  Yeah I was doing work  I was here working when I passed out  What time did you get here?  I think about 3.15, 3.30  I think you're far too at home here 
[03:29:00]  Not at all  You don't think so?  No  I think you're far too comfortable here  Justin in Long Island  Hey what's going on?  What's up?  You're on After Open Anthony Live  Listen do you guys have any tickets left to Jimmy's show this weekend?

[03:29:30]  For anti-social comedy went on sale today  And that's in Atlantic City  That's Martin Luther King weekend  So go to thebrokerage.com  While you can still  Because the first show sold out quickly  So I would go to thebrokerage.com  Get tickets  For the second show  For anti-social comedy  In Atlantic City  And do  Not the brokerage  The Borgata  Theborgata.com  And that's where  That's where I would see Jim Norton  If I were you  Alright good luck  Alright cool man thanks 
[03:30:00]  Again that's theborgata.com  For anti-social comedy tickets  That went on sale today  They probably won't last the day  So go on now  And if you're listening to the replay  You really should listen to the show live  Because they're probably already sold out  If you had listened live and done it  Yeah you would have had them  You might be fucked  You might be fucked  You might be fucked now  I don't  I'm not counting the tickets  But  If you're listening to the replay  Especially the second replay  I would say you're probably fucked  Yeah  Probably got the old  Rolling dick in the ass  So uh  How are you feeling 
[03:30:30]  Paul?  I feel fantastic  Do you?  Or do you  I mean feel like you  Spent two hours  Sleeping in a chair  Sleeping in a chair  In the office  Whatever  At least he was here  Yeah  Yeah  That was my point  I'd rather be here  I mean I  I'm functional today  It's not like I'm out  Fucking everything up  I just  You know  Had a little bit of a rough night  That's all  Did you uh  Were you phone screening today?  Uh for a bit  And then I was cutting some audio  Because I was gonna say  A cranky phone screener  With this show  Is not  Not a good thing  That short fuse 
[03:31:00]  From not sleeping  Troy you've been there  Because you DJ  Yeah  And uh  You come in here  Without sleeping  I literally just stay up  And come in  And then  And you've had a phone screen  Yeah  Like Paul you were there  For a short time today?  Uh yeah  Only like an hour or two  I traded Sal  And I had stuff to do  In the back  But I've always liked it  Better when I was angry  Paul  Do you see him slip that in  As if to say  Look I have a lot of stuff  Going on  I'm very important  Yeah  Here on the show  I had to do some stuff  In the back  Stuff that you know  The audience doesn't know  But a lot of stuff  Goes on back there 
[03:31:30]  And I'm responsible  Today's show  Couldn't have happened  If it weren't for me  Yeah  Because of the stuff  That went on  Behind the scenes  There's nothing going on  Behind the scenes  Ladies and gentlemen  There is no work  Being done here  Off the air  So don't let Paul  Trick you into thinking  That he is a vital  Part of the show  Um  And that's no offense Paul  No  None to  Okay good  I really sense  A lot of animosity  And anger  Towards Paul  I mean is it  From who?  From you  Well if he's gonna try  To bring in  Baked goods  And like 
[03:32:00]  He's trying to  Butter everybody up  Right  Butter everybody up  He works three days a week  All the mashups  Said it was awesome  Well the mashups  Say anything is awesome  That's their job  Hey it's an awesome day  It's the mashup  They have never  Said anything bad  About anything  No  I mean Nicole  Came in here  And said she got  Jizz in her eye  The other day  And it was awesome  So she  She never  Says a bad word  About anything  But  I mean if you're  Gonna come in here  With baked goods  And try to impress  The host  And say hey  I'm Paul  The new guy in town  I'm the greatest  Da da da  And you can't even 
[03:32:30]  Say you know what  I'm not gonna go out  Tonight cause I've  Worked tomorrow  I'm gonna be responsible  And I'm not gonna look  Like a schlub  When one of the interns  Walks in and says  Hey you guys know  Paul is sleeping  In the office next door  You see  Well I mean  At least he was here  Like I said  I guess so  But that's like  You know  He didn't  He didn't not do his job  But I feel like  He did the bare minimum  Fuck Roland is farting bad  Roland am I gonna have  To ask you to leave  You'll fuck yourself  Between him and Jim 
[03:33:00]  Jim just farts  Yeah  Farts  And today was a tired  Day for Jim  So it was just  It was just  Leaking out of his ass  Eric you got out lucky  Cause obviously Jim  Wasn't thinking about  Everything that was going on  Because he farted  On a newspaper page today  For no reason  It went nowhere  It provided nothing  But he decided to do it  He put the newspaper  On his ass cheeks  And farted directly  On to it  If he had gotten  Maybe a couple hours  Of sleep  And had his mind  Together  He would have  Obviously asked you 
[03:33:30]  To smell it  You know that  Well like I said  Earlier  He likes to come in here  During the break  And look for Troy  But he'll walk  Fully into the room  Have you seen Troy  No I haven't  Okay and then he leaves  And within a couple  Of seconds  You can't stand in here  Anymore  It's so bad  And by the way  He wasn't looking  For Troy at all  He just needed  A reason to come in  And goes to the bathroom  Is that him or Roland  He'll come in the back studio  And he'll just sit there  And just keep farting  And then he'll start  Wafting it over towards me  He does that to me too  When we're sitting  And if you yell at him  He goes  What are you doing  Enjoy it 
[03:34:00]  When we're sitting  In this studio  Since my position  Is next to him  If nobody's noticed  That he's farted  Which you know  Happens all the time  Because he farts  The whole show  Norton does  The whole time  He's just passing gas  He just starts  He just moves his hands  Or a newspaper  Or whatever  And just moves the air  Over to the computer chair  Right over in Sam's direction  Did you smell this one?  Enjoy it  And I've never enjoyed it  I don't think  That's what you do  In the office  I want people to enjoy my farts too  Yeah but nobody enjoys  Other people's farts  You enjoy your own farts 
[03:34:30]  I don't even enjoy  I don't  I like my own farts  Roland you enjoy your own farts  No not really  Like I'll Dutch oven myself  They're awful  Why?  Just to smell my own farts  The Dutch oven is when you  Fart under the blanket  And then pull it over your head  Yeah  And you do that to yourself  Sure I like my own farts  I can't disagree with them  You do that to yourself  I've absolutely done that to myself  Paul let me ask you this question  When you were sleeping here last night  Did you Dutch oven yourself  In the office?  No I didn't have a blanket  Thank god  I think it's weird that people don't  Paul you Dutch oven yourself? 
[03:35:00]  Even if there's no one in bed with you  Yeah it's not like  You're Dutch ovening yourself  It's  Yes it is  It's just like that  It's more like a curiosity thing  You're not holding yourself in  Like you would a Dutch oven  You're just kind of  Wafting it up to yourself  Just you know  You gotta check your own  I'm always fascinated  Of what comes out of my body  Yeah  It's kind of  Like you don't examine  Your own shit after you shit?  No I flush the  I wipe and flush  No people examine their own shit  You never peeked  Yeah I've just been like  Right you do too  You do right now  Well I mean it's death  Yeah  I'll take a look  To make sure I'm healthy  And there's times 
[03:35:30]  That you're like  Oh I'm proud of that  No I've never been proud  Of my bowel movement  You've been proud right?  Many times  Yeah like when it sticks out  Of the water  You're like fuck yeah  I want to show somebody  Or the three flusher  Yeah  But I'm also not  Like I like  I like the idea of having  Regular bowel movements  Yeah  You know what I mean?  Something solid  Something that  You feel like  Okay I had that  Out of my system  But beyond that  I don't take pride  Or take pictures  I'm not that  That's not me  You're clean 
[03:36:00]  Yeah one could say that  There's a lot of like  Normalcy to you  That I don't really  You don't like that  No it's not that I don't like it  It's just different  It's just not what I'm used to  Exactly  And being here  Normalcy  Like I know  I know I have to  Maintain this idea  Because I know in my head  That if I step away  From this O&A world  And talk to  What I like to call  People  Yeah  Human beings  They'll be like no  Why would anybody  Take pictures of their shit  That's disgusting  Yeah  But here in this room  With these people  I'm the outcast 
[03:36:30]  You're a weirdo  I'm the one that's like  What are you talking about Sam?  We all take pictures  Of our shit and admire  I don't admire  Anyone's bowel movements  And that includes my own  Hmm  That's a shame  You think I'm missing out  On something  Yeah  Like not being able  To appreciate  A fine work of art  Yeah  Well you've heard my bowel  I've recorded my bowel movements  I know  And I don't like to hear it  You don't like hearing yours  Or you don't like hearing mine  Both are factual  You laughed when I played you mine  In context  Right  But you also 
[03:37:00]  I laughed the first time  You insisted on playing  And playing  And playing  And I said okay  I understand what the bowel movements are  Well I'm really proud of that one actually  I figured that  I was able to take that away  From our conversation  Well because  You could actually hear  The velocity  And you can hear  The reverb  Inside the bowl  I mean I really captured  A magical moment  What is  From here  And Paul  And Paul  I shut down the bathroom  Yeah I mean  Roland has no bowel movements  To be proud of  He just leaves messes  Because he's got such  An unhealthy lifestyle 
[03:37:30]  But Paul  I don't know your lifestyle  How is  Do you usually have  A more healthy bowel movement  Paul he's on Joe Paterno  He's hitting on Joe Paterno  He's hitting on Joe Paterno  That's what it looks like  Why  Joe Paterno coaches football  Are you saying I'm a kid toucher  I'm not really  And Joe Paterno wasn't a kid toucher  Oh  You got the story completely wrong  Shit in my face  Well now that we talk about that  Paul  Bowel movements  Are yours more healthy  Are they more  You know  In the role 
[03:38:00]  No  Oh no no  It's not a war zone down there  It's more  And what is  Something Troy  That will leave you  Proud  Leave you sort of happy  With what you've left  In the bowl  I would say  Volume  Of the movement  That's what it is  Volume  Well  You want to fill the bowl up  Right  If you look at it  You're like  I can't believe  All of that  Just came out of me  Like you know  Where was that  Right  You know  Are you  Are you the same way  No  Bowel movement fascination 
[03:38:30]  That you have  No it's not really a fascination  It's just kind of something  You look at  And giggle for me  What do you giggle at  Like what's to you  Like funny bowel movement  Or just the fact  That there's caca  In your butt  That's the funny part  I made doo doo  That's funny  No I was just  I was just kind of chuckling  Because Troy's an audio guy  When he said volume  Volume I was thinking of  You know  Like the sound  Oh the loudness  Yeah that's what I thought  You know  The sound  Yeah of course  I mean  Of course  You know  If you're there  That goes without saying  Yeah 
[03:39:00]  If you're in a big bathroom  And you can get some nice reverb  Going on in the bathroom  Eric Nagel  Yes  You're a man who shits quite a bit  Do you take pride in your bowel movements  I don't take photos  And do what all the rest of you guys do  I look at it  But I don't  What does that say you guys  Are you not listening  No  You're in the Sam Roberts boat  Yeah I'm in the Sam Roberts boat  Right right  I understand  I believe you  When you say it Sam  I tend not to believe it  You don't believe it  Ask anybody on the staff  I've never shown them  Or texted them  Any kind of shit photo 
[03:39:30]  Ever  It's just that you make so much  You know what I mean  It's just that's why  It's hard to believe  No  Do you feel like  Troy when you're looking down  It's like one of your kids  Like I produce that  I name them  Yeah  You name your movements  I tell you  There's a say  I get proud  Well  It's disgusting  I want you to know that  Well  That's fine  But  You're not going to stop  No  Why would you  It's yours  It's not yours  Own it  You're giving it back to nature  Yeah  I was talking 
[03:40:00]  Before we were talking about  Paul being sleep  You know  Being cranky  You have come in here  Answered the phones  When you were screening calls  Without  Sleeping  Yeah  Is a cranky  Troy screening calls  A dangerous thing  Because to me  I've seen every phone  Screening we've ever had  Get very irritated  At the callers  And I can only imagine  That when you have  That sort of  I don't want anyone  To talk to me  Like  When you  When you don't sleep  You create this 
[03:40:30]  Tunnel vision  Of how the day  Has to go  What I need to accomplish  And anytime anyone  Interrupts it  Even to say  Good morning  Or hey  What's up man  This wasn't part  Of the tunnel vision  Now I'm starting  To get irritated  Yeah  The callers  How do you react  To them  It's rough  It is rough  Because you know  They all think  That they're comedians  Are they  No  No  No  But they think  They're funny  And you know  It's just  I don't know  You get to  You get to the point  Where you just 
[03:41:00]  You just want to get through it  And you're just like  I don't feel like  Even arguing  That's how tired you get  But then sometimes  You're like  You know what  Fuck it  I'm gonna  I'm gonna rip this guy  In your ass  I'm gonna go for it  I've got to release this  There's plenty of times  When Troy used to be in here  Where this call  Would still be going on  And he's debating  Some drunk truck driver  And I go  Troy why don't you  Just hang out  He goes  No this guy needs to learn  Why he's wrong  You always have to teach  Someone something Troy  Well and then people  Call you up and be like  Fuck you  I'm gonna come down  There and kick your ass  I'm like  Do it  I'm like dude  You're in fucking  Omaha  You know what I mean 
[03:41:30]  Like you're not coming  To New York City  To kick my ass  Why would you say that  I don't even understand  Why have the conversation  Just go okay  And then hang up  Next call  You have the power  Of the button  All you have to do  Is hang up on people  Why have the conversation  That's not as satisfying  No because I want to  I want to hear  What they have to say  When I say  You're in Omaha  You are not going to do that  And then hear what they say  Because sometimes  It does get monotonous  It gets really boring  Answering calls  So you have to  Sort of entertain yourself  And you have a little conversation  Do the Troy show  For a little bit  For a little bit  Why not  If the phones aren't ringing off 
[03:42:00]  The hook right now  Let's do a little  Troy Kwan show  Let's have fun  With what's his name  From Oregon  Who's not going to  Beat anybody up  Exactly  I understand  I get it Troy  Some of the callers  Though are excellent  Like the new  Mike Francesa we have  Yeah  Are you screening  Mike Francesa  Yeah I know  I don't know  Yeah I know  I know him  Yeah I know  Because  I'll tell you this  He's called in  Three days in a row  And every day  We have this  Mike Francesa guy  Who's been incredible  Awesome  But 
[03:42:30]  He's running a risk  Three days in a row  The burnout factor  Is getting very high  Do you think  And that's  It's a difficult part  Because for a listener  For anybody really  It's like  You hit on something  That people like  And  Roland  He's dozing  I worry about you so much  Amen  You're falling asleep  Yes  What are you doing in here  I don't know 
[03:43:00]  I'm tired  I know you are Roland  But didn't you go to sleep  Eric what time did Roland say  He fell asleep today  Or last night  Yeah he was supposed to go  To an event  And he skipped out  And he went home pretty early  Yeah  What time did you go to sleep  Last night  Probably  Like nine  You went to sleep at 9pm  What time did you wake up  Oh midnight  I had to take a massive dump  You woke up at midnight  To take a  How come we can't  Get past the dumps here  And then we're back to bed  So why are you so tired 
[03:43:30]  I don't know  You're falling asleep  Roland was literally  As I was having the conversation  Falling asleep  In front of everyone  Mars  Yes  He's falling asleep again  He's Mexican  Is that  Is it a Mexican thing  It's a Mexican thing  Are Spanish women  We talked to Mars earlier  Very at the top of the show  Are they really getting  Butt implants  You mean Hispanic women  I'm glad you correct me on that  Because I prefer to say  Hispanic women  Because  Let me tell you something  People don't realize this  Spanish  Means from Spain  Absolutely 
[03:44:00]  Hispanic refers to  The larger  Demographic  Ah  Roland farted  Roland  What are you doing in here  You're just farting and sleeping  You say that to a mic at least  You're driving me insane  What  You're  You're  You're  Two steps away  Troy just had to bring the mic  Down to your face  Roland is  Is a functioning human being  But he is three steps away  From  Having  Just needing  Hospital care  Like he just needs 
[03:44:30]  Things done for him  Like  If he get  One more step in this direction  Maybe I need a rub and tug  And some  Do you think you need a rub and tug  How often do you get rub and tugs  I  I don't know  Well you brought it up  You said maybe I need a rub and tug  Well maybe for energy  I don't know  Do rub and tugs give energy  Troy you've had rub and tugs  In the past  Do they give energy  Nah they want to put you to sleep  Roland did you get a rub and tug  Before you came in here  I wish  When was the last time  Roland you got a rub and tug 
[03:45:00]  I didn't discuss that  Well you brought it up  What do you mean you don't  Mars  Mars  You were in here  Yes I was in here  I heard it  Okay who brought up  Rub and tugs  Out of nowhere  Out of the blue  Roland  It's a private life sir  You mind your own fucking business  I'm minding my own business  I will fuck you up  Fuck your mom's bakery up  It was two weeks ago  For the record  My mother doesn't have a bakery  Two weeks ago  Yes sir  You got a rub and tug  Yeah  How was it

[03:46:00]  Which was a rub and tug  Paul you remember that  Yeah  You were a huge  Intern David fan  How often do you  Do rub and tugs  Not that often  No  No  But you went two weeks ago  Yeah  Cheaper than some  Bitches complain  You're like  You know what  I don't need to hear this  Was there any  Was there any reason  Specifically  That that day was the day  A lot of stressors at work  For the vets  For the vets overseas  But you went two weeks ago  Oh because you're thinking  About going again today  No not today no 
[03:46:30]  I have too much stuff to do  What do you have to do  Thanks  More important than a rub and tug  Yeah  What type of  Are we talking an Asian rub and tug  Last one  Somebody suggested this place  So I said sure  What place  Asian  Yeah  But you usually don't do Asian then  No Russians  You prefer a Russian rub and tug  Duh  Okay  So  How many times  More or less  Have you done  Have you been to a rub and tug

[03:56:30]  Sort of  Chimes  And nature sounds  And then  And then she used  The oils too  Well  And I know Eric  As far as hand jobs go  You're a sucker  For those oils  Yeah  So  Alright  So  You know  You're getting  Massage stuff  And then  When it gets to that point  All of a sudden  The lights go even lower  And they lock the door  Okay so  So  Okay  So she puts the music on  And you're laying there  And you're like  Oh this is great  And all of a sudden 
[03:57:00]  She puts the lights down low  No no that comes later  Locks the door  Little  Did we ever get some  Saxophone music  Or any kind of  Barry Manilow  No it was just like  It was like wind  Do do do do  Wind in  Oh Mr. Nagle  It's like that  Pure Moods music  You're so tense  Why don't we relax you  Alright  Okay I mean  I'm kind of uncomfortable  Don't worry Mr. Nagle  Don't worry about that thing  I see why they call you 
[03:57:30]  The sex man  Oh yeah  You are little sex man  Oh sexy man  Sexy man  Oh you  You're a  Much slimmer  Than you will be  So Aaron  Tell me about this  You weren't attracted to her  No  But she ended up  You did roll over  Onto your back  And she was  Admiring  You can figure out the rest  I think I've given you  It is a stranger  It's nice when it's a stranger  She was admiring 
[03:58:00]  Your torso  The physique  Oh  Chess and torso  What do we have  Down here  And meanwhile  There's  Ding ding  Ding ding  All the chimes  Are going  Was there any  Was there any  What are those  Sticks  Incense  Was she burning any incense  No no there wasn't any of that  Any scent  Oh I bake cookies  Cause men love  Smell fresh baking  Oh you're  No you're laying on  Like a really faded  Blue Winnie the Pooh  Blanket 
[03:58:30]  Or whatever it is  That they drink  What  Where did you go  Sandusky there before you  There was some weird  Chinese place  You got that right Paul  Yeah of course  So this is the question  Though  You say  You say  You say  You say  Don't worry about  The hairspray  Um  You  You said  You're very uncomfortable  With this woman  But  After all the oil  And the sexy talk  And the music  And the dimming  Of the lights 
[03:59:00]  You were still able  To get that  Nagel seed out there  Spraying across the room  If it had been a man  By that logic  No  Wouldn't you have  Also been able to get off  He's at DeRosa  No but I mean  It's a man's hand  But say like a feminine man  Like so  It's like a feminine man's hand  No  But they're using oil  No  And they have the music  And they have a soft Asian accent  Did you have your eyes closed  When she was  Mother  Jerking you off  Just think of me  As your Asian mother 
[03:59:30]  Uh yeah  I think I did  Okay so you're  He didn't  Yeah yeah  He was picturing something  Sexy  Something you were into  So by that logic  If a man was jerking him off  And he had his eyes closed  He would absolutely  It would be the same thing  It would be the same exact  Just another person  That he's not physically attracted to  Am I right Eric?  No  Why not?  What's the difference?  I would never allow a guy  No but you would know as a guy  Because your eyes were shut  No I knew  You would know as a guy  Because you didn't know  You could say no  If a guy touched you  You would know  But if a guy 
[04:00:00]  No because if a guy  Walked in  If a guy walked in  And you'd be like  Oh shit  There's a dude in here  But I can't say no  Because you didn't know the rules  So  That's a good point  Actually I didn't even think of that  If you let  If you let him start massaging you  And then he started to jack you off  By your logic  No  It would seem  No you're just throwing  That you'd be able to  The scenario in there  And I'm saying no  But why?  Because I knew ahead of time  Who was in there  I know but you said  You didn't like her  You said you were uncomfortable 
[04:00:30]  But you were still able  To make jism  You see?  Now you're starting to  No I'm not starting to question  You know what that  Pregnant pause was?  That was the pause  Of a man  Who's already in his 30s  Coming to terms  With his own sexuality  Just real  His whole world  Is falling apart  You may have to  Call your wife  And tell her something Eric  Because  If you were able  To achieve  This  Through a woman  You weren't attracted to  I don't see why  A man would be any different 
[04:01:00]  A feminine man  A man would never be  In this scenario  Why?  Men jerk each other off  All the time  Nope  Not happening  You may even  Men jerk each other  DeRosa was in here  The other day  Yesterday  Talking about getting  Jerked off by a guy  And jerking off a guy  Well he's just disturbing  He was  That was a weird thing  But Mars  Yes sir  You see my train of logic here  Don't you  Yes  Don't you think  That if  It had been a man  What if it was a transvestite  Eric  No  What if you didn't 
[04:01:30]  But you didn't know  And then all of a sudden  They were using the oils  On you  And then  No  And then  They were using the oils  And the music was playing  Can you see him  And the wind was blowing  He's getting very uncomfortable  Well because he knows  What's going on  So the music's playing  The wind is blowing  The incense is burning  No  The lights are down  The door is locked  And this woman's been  Talking to you the whole time  And she's been rubbing  Your shoulders  And she rubbed up  Right into your ass cheeks 
[04:02:00]  And kind of played  With the hole a little bit  Not  Didn't actually go in  But played with it  And I know you like that Troy  And the whole time  She's going  Oh yes  Oh you sexy nagle  Oh sexy nagle  And all of a sudden  She's got  She starts  She whips out the oil  And she goes  Oh you like oil  Yes I see  You like oil  And she starts  Right  And she starts the process  And she's using the oils  And then all of a sudden  She leans in  Right before you come  And says  Your cock is so hard right now 
[04:02:30]  You wouldn't come anyway  Nope you got me  You would too Eric  You would  You would  Paul  I would  You would right  Absolutely  I wouldn't scream  You're in too deep  No  Yeah  No return  Fuck it  I gotta get my nut off  Like it is what it is  Troy  You've had a lot of experiences  In your life  If  You were right there  And the oils  And the Asian woman  And the music  You're at liftoff  But then all of a sudden  Somebody whispers in your ear 
[04:03:00]  Oh your cock is so hard right now  Yeah dude  I don't think I could do it  I bet you would  I honestly like  Honestly  I'm not kidding when I tell you this  I think I would  I would turn into a limp noodle  And I think  Actually  Not only do I think you would  I think you might  If that was  The masseuse's opening line  That's how she started  And then started  Now dude  I like feminine man  Like if there's anything  Wait wait wait  Isolate it Eric  Isolate it  You said that you like feminine  If someone's jerking you off  You said you like  I like feminine  No you said you like feminine men  You absolutely do 
[04:03:30]  Eric  Can you get  Play that back for me  Play that back for me  Eric  You got to  Listen  While Eric's looking for that  Troy  While you're looking  I don't think I've recorded  I'm not kidding  No no no  Sit in here  And listen to it back  Because before Eric plays it  I just want you to know  If you're looking to please that guy  Get him some Argentium  Some nice  It's the king of all silvers  Steven Singer's got it going on right now  His website's  IHateStevenSinger.com  You can call him up  At 1-888  IHateStevenSinger  It's the king of silver medals  It starts at 149 bucks

He's on the other corner  Of Ethan Walnut  But they just  No no no  No no no  There's the corner  And then there's the other corner  You'll see it  It's a diamond shaped logo  It says Steven Singer  No but if I'm already  On the corner  Go to the other corner  But then I'm not  No no no  He's on the other corner  Got it  He's on the other corner  Don't go anywhere  I'm serious  I have to record  Well listen to this clip 
[04:05:00]  First  Let's listen to it  And go to  IHateStevenSinger.com  For all your Argentium needs  And other jewelry  Eric play back  For Troy the confession  He just made  That's how she started  And then started  Now dude  I like feminine man  Like if there's  You heard that  There was a  There was a comma  After feminine  No that didn't sound  Like any comma  Because a comma  Is usually in the English language  Why would I say feminine man?  Because you like a feminine man  I don't know what you like  I don't know what you're into  I like feminine man  There's a comma  You got that one too  Right Eric?  Because a comma  When speaking 
[04:05:30]  Is represented with a pause  And there was  No  Mars  It was a slight pause  There was  Only a pause  As there is between any words  Any word  Exactly  Not a comma  Fair enough  But just to set the record straight  I do not like feminine men  I like feminine women  And if somebody  Is jerking me off  And I'm paying for it  They're going to be  A feminine woman  Woman  Or  No  No or  No or  No or  Feminine woman  Or a  Feminine woman  Or any guy  A feminine girl 
[04:06:00]  Oh wait  The question was  If you didn't know  It was for the show  For the show  Dude I would not  Be into that  I'd be like  Stop  No  You freak out  You just shoot alone  I don't like the idea  Of a dude  Jerking me off  I don't like the idea  Of that  You didn't know  If they're whispering  With a low voice in my ear  I'm going to know  They're a dude  I'm going to be like  You know what  Take my cock  Out of your hand  I'm going to put on my shit  I don't care  And the music  Eric's music is playing  I'm putting on my trousers  And I'm getting the fuck out of there  Troy's scolding her like a dog  You take my cock  Out of your hand 
[04:06:30]  Drop it  Drop it  Drop it  Heel  Do I have to get the newspaper  Seriously  Heel  I thought I'd be pissed  That they tricked me  Yeah  Well that goes without saying  Now you're just getting  Into a hate crime  Yeah  Why don't you go record  Whatever you got to record  You're made up bullshit  You don't have anything to do  Right now  You don't have anything to do  Want to make a bet?  No I don't want to make a bet with you  I know where that  If I lose that bet  The money will just end up  In some guy-on-guy  Yankee-cranky  That Troy goes to  I know what Troy does  In his spare time  It's really not cool  Sam  I would like to know 
[04:07:00]  What Iraq did with this  His seed  This is a good question  Because we all know  From previous experience  On After Opie and Anthony Live  That Eric  Values his seed  Quite a bit  He believes  That the seed  Of Nagel  The Prince Nagel  Golden seed  Is  Such a commodity  That the other women  That he's been with  He needs to ejaculate  Into condoms  Then take off the condom  Tie it in a knot  And stick it 
[04:07:30]  In the small pocket  Not the big pocket  Of the jeans  Yes  This is what he does  He takes it out  Of the garbage can  And puts it  Into the little  Change pocket  The golden seed  Of Nagel  Wrapped up  In it's  In it's rubber casing  Now  Eric  Yes  What did you do  With the seed  That was left  With your 50 year old  Asian masseuse  I didn't  Do anything  With it  How long  Did you worry  Because this 
[04:08:00]  Eric  Is a risk  Can you imagine  Some woman  Who's you know  Which is working  In a massage parlor  Obviously  You know  She's fallen on  Some hard times  Because she's  Jacking guys off  For a living  And now  She's in possession  Of the golden  Nagel seed  Is this not something  That concerned you  No  Not at that point  No  That's bullshit  Eric  That's not bullshit  Because 2000  Was this before  Or after you won  The lottery  Oh this is before  Okay so maybe  Was it the lotto money  That changed your perception  On how valuable 
[04:08:30]  That nagel seed is  When the women  Started coming around  Trying to get  Some of that cash  Trying to get  Some of that paper  No I think it's  Once I had  Steady girlfriends  Then  That went away  Yeah but you didn't  Have a steady girlfriend  When you went to  Massage parlor  Not at that point  No  That's why I'm saying  I think  That there was  There was a little  More to it  Than just you saying  Oh it goes  Where it goes  I have a feeling  That whenever  And by the way  Yes  Rooster in Arizona  Nagel argentium seed  Is what it is  That's how precious 
[04:09:00]  It's the finest  Of all seeds  It's shinier  Than anyone else's  I think you know  Exactly where that seed went  You kept track of it  Because the load  Shoots out of Eric  And he watches it  Go up into the sky  And he keeps an eye  Exactly on where it lands  So that way  Once the room is clear  He can recover that seed  Put it into one of his containers  And add it  To the nagel tree  Where he's trying to grow  Small nagels  I don't know  If any of it is true  But I think it is 
[04:09:30]  Monica  You remember Monica  The girl who was  Here  At this point  A couple months ago  She was going to  Date DeRosa  She's listening  So she said  She heard us  Bringing up the tranny thing  And she's no longer  Interested in dating  Joe DeRosa  This After Open Anthony Live  Has been brought to you  By Trojan Bearskin Condoms  Trojan  America's number one  Most trusted condom brand  Sex man  You can trust Trojan  And if you trust Trojan  Anyone can
