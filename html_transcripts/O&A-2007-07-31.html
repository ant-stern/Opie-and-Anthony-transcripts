<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts defiantly embracing their "bad boy" image, rejecting calls for more palatable radio content.  The show kicked off with "Rock Scream Tuesday," featuring numerous callers, including a highly intoxicated Beth who engaged in sexually suggestive conversations with the hosts and another caller, Justin.  One caller, Dan, delivered a particularly well-received rock scream.  The conversation then shifted to the Daily News' interview with the "shoe bomber," Richard Reid, eliciting outrage from the hosts over perceived media hypocrisy.  They also humorously dissected CNN sports anchor Larry Smith's clumsy attempt to downplay a statement equating harming dogs to raping a woman.  A discussion followed comparing public reactions to the Michael Vick dog fighting case and the Kobe Bryant rape accusation, with the hosts speculating on the disparity. This segment ended with jokes about Hollywood's use of dream sequences to avoid controversial topics and a panning of the movie *Who's Your Caddy*.  The hosts then covered the alleged robbery and stripping of Prince Von Anhalt, Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband, by three women, followed by another rock scream and a news story about a Mets fan killing his mother with a barbell after a game loss. The show promoted a *Superbad* screening and concluded with a comedic audio clip of a helicopter crash with added pornographic sound effects.

The next segment started with a discussion of MSNBC's graphic depiction of a murder victim contrasted with NYC's censorship of buttocks on a billboard.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion on the psychological effects of violent crime shows, veering into a discussion of a rape case involving identical twins, solved by a tattoo discrepancy.  This was followed by jokes about Sam's childlike eating habits and a brief mention of the Chris Benoit story. The show promoted their Detroit appearances, including a book signing with Jimmy, a local television appearance, and Jim Norton's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel. A chaotic interview with Marge from the Little Shelter animal rescue dominated this segment. Marge initially compared the Michael Vick case to the Holocaust (a statement she later retracted), and the conversation devolved into discussions about a dog named Ingrid who received Viagra, Marge's personal life, and the shelter's pet cemetery. The hosts aggressively teased Marge throughout.  This segment also included discussion of a rapper dropped by McDonald's, the Don Imus controversy fallout, a hoax phone call from Bulgaria, and a segment featuring actual suicide notes. The segment ended with a listener story about waking his wife with a "Jimmy noise," leading to a domestic dispute.


The following segment began with a rundown of the day's recurring segments: Rock Scream Tuesday, Diabolical Laugh Tuesday, Hummer Tuesday, Far Away Phone Call Tuesday, and Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday. The hosts then read aloud several actual suicide notes, followed by a humorous suicide note generated online for E-Rock, referencing his perceived penis size. The show then transitioned to the promotion of a "Hottest Rod Contest" sponsored by the movie *Hot Rod*, which involved applying Icy Hot to one's genitals.  The hosts discussed the contest's absurdity and homoerotic implications, playing and critiquing a promotional announcement. Listener calls commented on the contest and the show's perceived double standards regarding gender.  Andy Samberg's upcoming appearance was mentioned. The contest then proceeded in studio with three contestants,  guided by the hosts and a studio guest, Kenny, through exercises to intensify the Icy Hot's burning sensation.  One contestant, Rob, showed a strong reaction. Studio guest Jared was tasked with blowing on the contestants' genitals. A listener called in to describe a planned dynamite explosion at a construction site to be livestreamed on Paltalk.

A subsequent segment focused on the *Hot Rod* "Hottest Rod Contest," featuring three contestants and intern Jared.  Jared, wearing "hot rod underpants," endured increasingly bizarre challenges, including leg-bicycle exercises, repeated Icy Hot applications, and a "freestyle" round.  A listener threatened to blow up the studio, a remote dynamite explosion was orchestrated via PalTalk, and Bengay patches were applied.  The contest culminated in mousetraps being snapped onto the contestants' scrotums.  Andy Samberg appeared as a guest during the later stages.  The increasingly absurd challenges resulted in Jared sporting a pube beard.

The final segment featured Andy Samberg, promoting *Hot Rod*.  He compared his *SNL* experiences to Jim Breuer's, referencing the show's brutality.  The interview focused on Samberg's viral videos, "Dick in a Box" and the Vista disc shredding video, including discussion of online criticism and the Emmy nomination for "Dick in a Box." The conversation then took an absurd turn with mousetraps, Icy Hot, and the application of these items near or on the guests' genitals.  Samberg discussed his kissing scene with Scarlett Johansson.  A contest was held to see who could get a mousetrap closest to Jared's nose without touching it while simultaneously teabagging the mousetrap.  Rob won. The segment concluded with further promotion of *Hot Rod* and the playing of the unedited version of "Dick in a Box".

God  Who could put up  She would have to be  The babe of babes  To put up with that drunken babble  And her drunk puke breath  Well, only half the audience heard this  Because we had to dump out  But the guy in the background is like  Hey, tell him you got nice  Blanks  Yeah  And it sounded like there were a few more people over there 
[00:14:00]  So expect a gangbang  Yeah  Yeah, something  Something's going on  Let's say hi to O-Town Joe  What's up, O-Town?  What's up, guys?  How are you, man?

Like his heart rate went through the roof for over an hour  And he was rushed to a hospital before a gig  That's all I know  Is he was supposed to do a show 
[00:16:00]  And there was someone with his heart rate  And they just  Gene  Tommy  Who plays in Ace's Makeup  And I think Peter  Just did the show  Were the three of them  Oh, really?  Yeah  Well, why  Why miss out on all that cash?  Jeez  Gene Simmons  Instead of being hospital side with his buddy  Are you kidding me?  Ah, you know  We could still do this show  And get a couple of bucks  Yeah  How I read it  There was a bit of a panic  Yeah  Among the kiss camp  Because his heart rate went way up  And they actually went and did the show anyway 
[00:16:30]  I think they did  While he's getting checked out in the hospital  Unless they read it wrong  Oh my god  I hope you read that wrong  No, they did the show  Oh, they did the show  They did the show  They did the show without him  Gene probably just sang his songs  Yeah  As Paul Stanley is hooked up to all sorts of equipment  Wondering if he's going to live or die  Yeah  Big boots hanging off the end  Right  Big, huge boots  Where's some kiss?  Yeah, let's hear some kiss  That's terrible, man 
[00:17:00]  But he went to the hospital  I guess he had a tachycardia  What's that?  It's when your heart starts beating really quick  Okay  It like, you know  Doubles, sometimes triple the rate  And you gotta get it slowed down  Or else, you know  Burns out on you  Do you think it would be a drag  To drop dead of a heart attack  With your kiss makeup on?  Yes  Or would that be really cool?  No  Not cool  Not cool?  Not cool  Trying to put the toe tag  On the wacky shoe  That he's wearing  And then the mortician  Has to kind of like  Just wipe off your makeup 
[00:17:30]  Sam  All right, here we go  So what do we got here?  Paul Stanley  Doing fine today  How's everybody doing?  Oh no  What should we do?  All right, let him keep playing  Just get Paul to the hospital  Why can't we hear you? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, wow  There he goes  And there's Gene  Don't mind the sirens, people  Ignore that  He's okay  He's okay  He's okay  Everything's gonna be okay  Don't worry  Don't worry  Don't worry  I can sing Paul's part 
[00:18:30]  The show must go  Paul would want it this way  Paul definitely would want it this way  Pay no attention to them  Pumping his chest  It's just part of the show  Yeah, don't worry  The rest of the group  Played as a trio 
[00:19:00]  In Stanley's absence  That's nuts  Oh, it's Eric Singer  And he sang some of  Eric Singer?  All right, well  We're glad Paul Stanley's doing well  He's a great guy  He's been on our show  Many, many times  I'd like to hear the argument  Between Paul and Gene  About how Paul isn't getting paid  For that gig  You weren't there  You weren't there  Fair is fair  It's the first time  In their 30-something year history  That they did a gig  I thought they had done that before  But apparently  That's just when one of them  Blows out their voice 
[00:19:30]  Yeah  The other one will pick up  The singing duty  But the guy will stay on stage  Right?  Do you believe  You should get paid  If you weren't at the gig?  But I was in the hospital  I'm, you know  I was almost  You weren't at the gig  You believe money should come out of  The food should come out of  My children's mouths  No, but Gene  I really need a  Gene, give me a break  Will ya?  Please?  No, you weren't there  You're not getting paid 
[00:20:00]  But  But I have  Oh, get him out of my room  Get him out of my room  He'd be on the table dead  And Sam wouldn't understand  He'd think it was a girl  It's not a girl  It's a boy in makeup, Sam  Quincy  Of course it's Quincy  Of course it's Quincy  I don't even have to  He wouldn't understand  I don't even have to  Close my eyes anymore  It's obvious  Sam wouldn't get it  Quince would have to explain  Yeah  And Quincy, I think  Wouldn't even understand  The makeup, though  He'd probably wipe his finger 
[00:20:30]  Along the guy's cheek  And go  This is makeup  Like he wouldn't understand  The concept of makeup like that  It was a porno accident, Sam  A porno  It was funny yesterday  When Otto pointed out  That Quincy had  Fleshy hands  Fleshy  And his fleshy hands  His fleshy hands  Would open when he talked  Murder  Murder  F and Steven asked  From Bayshore, man  Here's the line  Hey, Ope  I guess we can look forward to  We can look forward to 
[00:21:00]  Being able to buy  A Kiss pacemaker soon  Ah  The Kiss pacemaker  Sold exclusively by Gene, of course  Yeah, well  Alright, we're just getting started  Thanks to Beth and Rochester  For a fine, fine opening  To the Ope and Anthony show  I would have hated to have  Been in that emergency room  Imagine what it smelt like  After they zapped him  With all that chest hair  Just burning hair everywhere  Just burning chest hair  Come on, people  Well, they had to stop his heart 
[00:21:30]  And then restart  I know  That's a really weird  It was like 100 and something beats  Let me see  They gave you  140  What was it?  Give him a little defib  190 plus beats  190  Oh, that's cranking  That's bad, right?  I don't know how many beats  Your heart goes  That's cranking  Average, if you're kind of resting  It should be around 70  Yeah, and then  Around there  If you're rocking like that  You'd probably crank it up  To about 130  140 maybe  140 possibly, sure 
[00:22:00]  If you're really rocking  At his age  But 190  Just hanging out backstage  Or something  Can you imagine that  Then also be like  Look, we just gotta stop this hard  To get it back to normal  Yeah  Bamp  Give him the  Bamp  But I'd rather you didn't  Could you do it  Could you just slow it down  Yeah  And that would be that  Do we have to stop it  Isn't there a better way  To do that  It doesn't know  Alright, we're going to break  With little Jimmy Norton  Doing his version of Beth  On the piano  This is Jimmy playing piano  This is Jimmy singing Beth

[00:28:30]  Weekly world news  That people buy  Thinking it's real  Where's bat boy  There you go  That is what it's like  The weekly world news  Yeah  Cave boy says  Yes  I'll escape  They used to have  The greatest headlines  In the weekly world news  The JFK spotted alive  And then they take  A picture of JFK  And age it real poorly  Give him gray sideburn  And show him like  Walking out of a  Baskin Robbins  Right  Because that's where  He would go  Yeah  Or then show him  Yawning  But it's really just him  With his head back  In the limo  Yeah  Speaking of 
[00:29:00]  We're mentioned in an article  You were saying how  When we mess up  Well it's being referenced  In this little piece  CNN anchor suggests  Killing dogs  Everyone's talking about  The Michael Vick thing  Right  Yeah  This guy suggested  One of the anchors on CNN  Suggests killing dogs  Worse than rape  I think he was a sports guy  Yeah  Well they're calling him  A CNN anchor  But you're right  He is a sports guy  CNN anchor suggests  Killing dogs worse than rape  Where's the outrage  Is the headline  In the wake of the Don Imus 
[00:29:30]  Opie and Anthony scandals  One would think a press figure  Suggesting that killing a dog  Was worse than raping a woman  Would draw a lot of media attention  However a CNN sports anchor  Named Larry Smith  Made such a comment on Thursday  And I would venture to guess  That few readers had even heard about it  Now the way they put it  In the headline  Is not really the way it went down  Right  It sounds like he went  Oh come on  Killing a dog is much worse than rape  He didn't literally say that  He kind of alluded to something 
[00:30:00]  Like that but  And then Nancy Grace  It was on her show  She blew it out of proportion  Yeah  Listen to the clip  Yeah we got the clip  Think  And then it ends with  Think there'd be such media silence  If a well-known conservative  Made such a remark  It's gotta be liberal conservative  Make it that  Oh man  Yeah so here's  This is Larry Smith  Listen  The best part of this clip  Is Nancy Grace  Kind of calls him out  On what he said  And he just  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  Well  What I meant 
[00:30:30]  I  Seems to me  Seems to me like a producer  Fed her that too  Like it passed her by  And then a producer  Was like  Yeah  In her ear  And then she realized  Oh yes yes  Let me bring that up  Yeah  And then Larry's like  Oh wow  Which way did he go  It's like did I  Was she accusing me of saying that  Wait did I say that  All intelligence  Just leaves his brain  Yeah  Never heard a man  Not improv  Right  As well as this guy  Didn't improv  This could be the worst improv ever  I have to Larry Smith 
[00:31:00]  CNN sports correspondent  And CNN anchor  What's Nick afraid of  Come on  He's been in front of the camera  A million times  What's so hard about  Declaring your innocence  Yeah well  That's  He's been in a lot of trouble lately  When you think about  All the other incidents  And this is  Just the worst one  Of all  And keep in mind too  That while  Comey Bryan is a situation  We can  Sort of compare this to  This really  Is much worse  Not only  Can you argue  That the crimes are much worse  In terms of  You know  Killing dogs  And that kind of thing  But as an NFL starting  See that's where 
[00:31:30]  He kind of got into  A little jam up  He's stating that  The crimes are worse  Now the crimes  One was  Alleged rape  Right  And this one is  Alleged  Killing of dogs  And holding dog fights  Right  Now  Is this guy actually  Was he implying  That the crimes are worse  I don't know  In this case  Because Jimmy brought up  A valid point  Well the  Killing of the dogs  Was horrific  But the outrage  The drowning of the pit bulls  And the hanging pit bulls  The outrage of the people 
[00:32:00]  Given each news story  Is worse with the dogs  Yeah  Now that's just the way it is  People weren't as outraged  At the Kobe story  As they are at the dog story  Everyone's talking about  Oh my god  Did you hear what they did  To the dogs  Did you hear what they did  They hung them  They drowned  People have been  Nothing but talking about that  The atrocities against these dogs  When they talk about the story  But with the Kobe story  It was pretty much  Well she did go up  To the room 
[00:32:30]  Yeah yeah  She seemed like  She wanted it  Well she was asking for it  Yeah  It seems like  You know  There's a lot of things  She was kind of into it  And then maybe  During the act  When things got  You know  Turned around a bit  If you want to say  That  She got a little upset  So like  They applied a lot of things  People are more outraged  At the dogs being killed  And fighting  Than they are with the Kobe rape 
[00:33:00]  You see all the animal lovers  Outside the court  Yeah  You don't get that  Many people showing up  For a murder case  Or a rape case ever  It's  Dude living in Manhattan  I'm convinced that people  Care about animals  Way more than they care about  Their fellow  Their fellow human beings  Hell yes  They care way more  About their pets  He should have just  Stuck to his guns  And went yes  I am implying that  That women can be irritating  While dogs are fun to pet  Dogs are always  Man's best friend  Yeah  And sometimes 
[00:33:30]  A woman can be a C  Yeah  He should have said  Drop the C bomb  Yeah  Well I backed it up  So listen  Oh god  He would have been crucified  You might as well  Go out with a flare  Yeah  Oof  Listen to Larry Smith  He just  He loses it  Bye  Bye  AI star  Keep in mind too  That while Comey Bryan  Is a situation  We can sort of compare this to  This really is much worse  Not only can you argue  That the crimes are much worse  In terms of  You know  Killing dogs  And that kind of thing  But as an NFL starting quarterback 
[00:34:00]  You are the most visible face  In that city  I mean I've said it all along  Is that you know  If you try to go through  And you know  Very quickly name  Ten mayors  Of major cities  In the country  Larry Smith  Did I just hear you say  You could have a harder time  Doing that  Than naming ten NFL starting quarterbacks  Did I just hear Larry Smith  CNN sports correspondent  And anchor  State that  Crimes on a dog  Are much worse  Than crimes on a woman  Did I  Did I hear that  I'm sorry  You  I'm saying  They could be  I'm sorry 
[00:34:30]  You  I'm saying  I'm sorry  You  I'm sorry  You  I'm sorry  You  I'm sorry  You  What  Did I say  What  I'm not here  I'm not here  I left  Like what could he do  He wanted to leave  That situation  Larry actually wanted to say  That woman  I don't know  Did he say that  And find a Larry  Where's Larry  Please  I'll argue that point with you  Please God  Let me not be Larry  I'm not Larry 
[00:35:00]  I'm not Larry  Check my license  Oh damn it  I'm Larry  I'm gonna go old school  You mean  Me  You mean me  His first sentence  After that long pause  Made no sense  Just listen to him  Try to gather his thought  I backed it up  I just hear Larry Smith  CNN sports correspondent  And anchor  State that  Crimes on a dog  Are much worse  Than crimes on a woman  Did I  Did I hear that  I'm sorry  You  I'm saying  They could be  I'm not arguing 
[00:35:30]  Which is worse  Which one is worse  I'm just saying  That in terms of  His visibility  Is much worse  Oh my  His visibility  Is much worse  And then he just  Changes to something  Like who's more famous  Right  He went to  Who's more famous  Meanwhile Kobe  Is Kobe  Kobe  Kobe's  So god damn famous  He's a superstar  Michael Vick  Is a very famous guy  Yeah  Kobe  Is a superstar  And he's trying to say  That Kobe  Because he's in LA  Isn't as famous 
[00:36:00]  Because there's so many  Famous people around  So he just kind of  Falls through the cracks  Of famous people  But then being in Atlanta  Right  Michael Vick  Is like  So famous  He's a god in Atlanta  Because  It's not like LA  Right  Excuse me  I asked you  What is worse  Being raped  Or a dog being killed  Larry  Larry  Larry  Larry  Give us the answer  Larry  Oh what a tool 
[00:36:30]  Now we gotta try something  Here  Hold on  No but you could say  That it's what  No but you  No  No  I'm sorry  But you then  Did the thing  With the other  One  I'm on TV  What  What happened  Where's the door  Where's the door  I'm gonna run  He was wishing  For a trapped door  At that point  Oh please  Please  Make a special  News alert  That cuts into this  I don't know  What to say 
[00:37:00]  Oh no  I'm in a situation  Oh I screwed up  I'm gonna be  In the situation room  Oh is this  Gonna make them  I could be fired  People get fired  For this  They fired  I'm his  For something like this  I just said  Dogs being hurt  Is worse than rape  And they  They went after  Opie and Anthony  Oh I'm screwed  Oh god  I have a mortgage  Oh god  I have a mortgage  Okay I gotta answer  I gotta answer her  Wait wait  I'm sorry 
[00:37:30]  You said the thing  What  He's giving  A census report  Let me check the drudge report  The drudge report  Am I on there yet  Okay nothing on here yet  It's been eight seconds  And I'm in the clear  Alright let me check it  Okay still nothing there  Okay let me google  My name  Oh no  It's google news  Oh no  Oh it's there  Oh it's there  Oh god  Okay but it's only one  Wait a minute  What's the second story 
[00:38:00]  Larry google's name  To see if  But they are quick  They are quick  Alright I gotta hear this again  Here it is  Starting quarterbacks  Did I just hear  Larry Smith  CNN sports correspondent  And anchor  State that  Crimes on a dog  Are much worse  Than crimes on a woman  Did I hear that  I'm sorry  I'm saying  It could be  Which is worse  Which one is worse  I'm just saying that  In terms of  His visibility  Is much worse  His visibility  Is much worse 
[00:38:30]  Than what  Colby Bryant said  Colby Bryant  Is a superstar  In the NBA  But at the same time  He plays in Los Angeles  With the city full of stars  Michael Vick  Is the most  The most visible person  In the city of Atlanta  Maybe ever  In the history  Of Atlanta sports  He didn't even address  That's what she said  He's smart  He was like  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I gotta get out of this  That was the worst  Backpedal  Well he would kill the dogs  At 11 o'clock  That's only 8 a.m.  In Los Angeles  Right  See it's different  If you think about it 
[00:39:00]  Really it's really different  Wow  That's brilliant  Isn't that great  He used the Chewbacca defense  Right  All right  Well he might have  Squeaked out of that one  Well you know what  Like I said  I mean  People care more about pets  Than their felonies  People do  That's the route  He should have taken  Was that  You know  It's like when  John Lennon said  The Beatles  Are bigger than Jesus  Right  And there was a bunch 
[00:39:30]  Of outrage  And he said  He said  I wasn't saying  That we're bigger  Than Jesus  Like that  So I'm just saying  That at this point  In time  We're more popular  More people know  About us  More people are  Fanatical  About the Beatles  Than they were  About Jesus  He kind of blew that one  Yeah  To think that more people  Knew about the Beatles  Than  Oh yeah  I'm not saying it's right  I'm just saying  He handled it  Better than this guy did  But that's what a rock star  Is supposed to say 
[00:40:00]  Yeah  So screw you all  You want your rock stars  To say stupid things  But this guy  Outrageous things  This guy should have said  What I mean is  There seems to be  More outrage  From the public  For these animals  Being killed  Than there was  For the woman  Being sexually assaulted  Well Nancy Grace  In the Kobe case  But Nancy Grace  Is just a troublemaker  In general  If you're watching the show  She's always trying  To get that  That headline  I mean  Just the coverage  I've seen so far  With all the people 
[00:40:30]  Outside the courthouse  There is much more  Of an outrage  In this case  Than there was  With the Kobe Bryant case  People don't like  When a little puppy  You know that doesn't  Even test well  In films  People can be killed  Left and right  But when a little pet  Or an animal  Gets killed in a movie  It doesn't test well  And they usually  Bring them back  War of the Roses  Old Yeller  Well Old Yeller  Was supposed to  End like that  I'm talking incidental  And it was sad  And it was very sad  But there's 
[00:41:00]  A War of the Roses  Where Michael Douglas'  Dog is supposed  To have been killed  By his wife  They were going  Through the divorce  And cooked into a  Patay  And a patay  And served to him  Which is a great thing  For a woman  That hates a man  To do to him  After he accidentally  Like killed the cat  Or something  Backed over the cat  And then it didn't test well  It like  People went nuts  About that  And they had to then  After he ate it 
[00:41:30]  And thought he was  Eating his dog  Show the dog  In the bushes outside  Right  A quick cut  To the dog  To show the dog  Because people  Can watch in the movies  Other people being killed  And ravaged  And raped  But if you show  A cute little doggy  Getting killed  You're going to upset people  You know what I hate  About Hollywood  They'll do that  Exact scenario  Like you said  But then they make it  That it was just a dream  That's how they get out of crap  Yeah  I hate when they do that  In movies  And TV shows  Because you see something  Really outrageous  And different 
[00:42:00]  You're like  Oh I can't believe  They went there  And then  Oh what  What happened  It's like  Ah you cop out  Oh by the way  Fatal attraction  Yeah  The little bunny rabbit  That was sad  Yeah but no one cared  About the bunny rabbit  They cared  No one cared  Bunny rabbits  Are pets too  When it's a pet  That somebody has  A relationship with  There's a problem  Yeah  Rabbits are queer  No one likes a rabbit  Timid retards  I get it  You're twitchy  You had me laughing  Because you had commented  On rabbits the other day  And I was sitting out 
[00:42:30]  In my yard yesterday  Last night  And there was a bunny rabbit  In my backyard  And all he was doing  Is sitting there  And twitching his nose  And I was just thinking  How stupid and silly  He looked  Because of what you said  You know what I like to do  I like to hang out  In gardens  In a rabbit suit  And I put carrots by me  And I put signs  That say carrot stew  And when they come over  I right hook  Their stupid rabbit faces  Stop twitching  Yeah  All they do is twitch  That nose  And nose is constantly twitching  And they're eating my grass 
[00:43:00]  People don't like  When animals kill  They're going to hate  Underdog  You know Underdog  Actually ends in 37 minutes  He's putting his cape on  And a drunk driver  Just backs over him  It's a very very  Unconventional end  To a kids movie  And then the whole  Stunned audience  Just has to get up  And leave  And leave  The low muttering rumble  Of how awful  The movie was  What was that  Happened  Underdog's dead  What was that  What the hell  I'd like my money back 
[00:43:30]  Hold that thought  We've got to take a break  Really quickly  We've got really  Really  Really  Really good ratings  Here in New York City  And we want to  Kind of celebrate  With our listeners  Tomorrow  At 5pm  We're doing a special  Screening  Of Superbad  They set up  A screening for us  Yes  To see Superbad  And then we decided  Why not do it  With the listeners  Because they were  Going to just throw us

Right  And speaking of movies  I can't get enough of this  Who's your caddy?  Can't get enough of meeting  You loved it 
[00:48:00]  You know what?  I've got to start seeing some of these movies  Like, to me, I'm like  There's no effing way I would ever go see this movie  I know  But I've got to think of the radio show a little more  I've got to go see this just for the radio show  You know how your blonde hair would stand out in that theater?  Oh my goodness  But they try to sneak this one past us  Like, it came out of nowhere  The commercials all of a sudden popped on  Like, three days before the movie hit the theaters  And I'm sitting there like  Wait a minute  This is a black version of Caddyshack  Caddyshack, yeah  Totally  And it kind of was under the radar 
[00:48:30]  And then it blasted on our TVs  The commercials  And now it's in theaters  Doing awful, awful business  And I went to  We stole their music  And now they're stealing our movies  Well, I went to  RottenTomatoes.com  The best place to go for movie reviews  Because they take all the reviews from all over the country  From all the big newspapers  And then they give you one general review  Yep  Here are some of the reviews for Who's Your Caddy  I don't know how screenwriters could turn out this rip-off of Caddyshack 
[00:49:00]  And not get sued  Wake me up when urban films stop using  Get Back at Whitey as a comedic device  How about black films and not urban films?  Urban  The latest entry in the story  White people are like this  Black people are like that  Comedy sub-genre  Hysterical always  The most degrading minstrel coon show since Soul Plane  That's an actual review  Wow  And finally 
[00:49:30]  If this demeaning movie had been made by mainstream Hollywood  It would be courting charges of racism  It's funny they called it a minstrel show like Soul Plane  Two of my friends were in Soul Plane  Kevin Hart is a good friend of mine  And Godfrey  Kevin Hart starred in it  I'm so happy they called it  We teased him  A minstrel show  Horribly about that film  I'm so happy  That was awful  I saw that on cable  Yeah  Oh just awful  So there you go 
[00:50:00]  Soul Plane  Some of the fine reviews coming in for Who's Your Caddy  Just getting awful reviews on RottenTomatoes.com  Really quickly  Prince Von A-Hole  Naked in his roles  You might be asking yourself  Who is Prince Von A-Hole?  Do you remember the Anna Nicole Smith situation?  Sure  Where they were gone  She's dead  They did their own movie  Who's Your Daddy?  They were trying to find out  Who fathered her kid 
[00:50:30]  The mystery father  And you had Howard K. Stern  You had that other dude  The guy that turned out to be the father  The blonde guy  What's his name?  Greg Opie Hughes  Larry Burkhead  He looked more like Jay Moore  Who's that awful name  Danny Lynn  Danny Lynn  And then Zsa Zsa Gabor is what?  Tenth husband?  Ninth husband?  Something like that?  This cadaver  Peter O'Toole and Caligula  Is her ninth husband  Ninth husband  Yes  Which is creepy 
[00:51:00]  Because she's 90  He's 64  He's 64  They've been married a while  Like 10 years or whatever  So if she was 80  Something like that  He was 54 at the time  I think he was going for  A few shekels  Her cash?  I don't know  Dude he's 64  And she was  When she was 30  Right  He was 6  I don't think they were seeing each other then  Yeah that would be  I could be mistaken  Yeah  Perhaps younger than that Jim  So remember  Remember he did his press conference 
[00:51:30]  And he was pretty much  Hinting to the world  That he might be the father  Because he had like a 10 year  Fling with Anna Nicole Smith  Yeah  Off and on for 10 years  And then you got the famous clip  Sometimes I'm a bad boy  Yeah  Yeah  Sometimes I'm a bad boy  Yeah  That's chicken  Good  Yeah  Well here's the latest on  Prince Von A-Hole  Naked in his roles  Yes  Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband  The wacky Freddy Von  Honhalt  64  Was photographed after 
[00:52:00]  A trio of women  Robbers  Pulled up next to him  Asked for a photo  So it's these three women  They just pull up  And go  Hey I recognize you  From the end of  Nicole Smith  The dumb prince  We want a picture  But instead of getting a picture  They robbed him at gunpoint  Took all his clothes off  Left him naked  And cuffed him to his Rolls Royce  Sure they did  That's what he's claiming  This guy is nuts  And we're looking at a picture  Of him completely naked  In his Rolls Royce  Kind of hunched over 
[00:52:30]  Because he doesn't want anyone  To see his junk  And they didn't take his hat  They didn't take his hat  And they didn't cuff him  It's like he's loosely tied  To his steering wheel  With something  With some kind of strap  With something you can do  By yourself  Yeah  Because it's kind of hard  To make it look like  People tied you  To the steering wheel  When you have to tie yourself  You can't like get your hands  Wrapped around the right way  But how would you tie yourself  To the steering wheel  I'm convinced he did  That's just it  You can't really tie yourself 
[00:53:00]  He did it poorly  And maybe he  If anyone asked any questions  He's like look  I was almost able  To get myself out of this  Yeah  Yeah  There were no witnesses  To the robbery  The wackadoodle prince  Has been involved  In a feud  With Gabor's  Wackadoodle  Daughter  Francesca Hilton  A Santa Monica judge  Fined  Jaja  $3,800  For not showing up in court  Blah blah blah blah  So that's the latest on him  He was found naked  In his Rolls Royce  I like how they 
[00:53:30]  Three women robbed him  Call him the imbeciling  Ninth husband  Yeah  Imbecile  Oh Jaja  Just  She was Miss Hungry  In 1936  36  Do you realize  If she walked by Hitler  He would have whistled  That's how old she is  1936  Miss Hungry  Oh  Look at that  And they got him  Sitting on that  Probably very hot  Black seat 
[00:54:00]  Yeah  Must have been like  Melting Turkish taffy  Running down that seat  They had to  Kind of like  He's nude  They had to pull his sack off  Oh  Sounded like a fruit roll up  Yikes  Alright  Let's not forget everybody  It's a very big day  On the Opie and Anthony show  Is it?  Oh  Oh  guitar solo 
[00:54:30]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock Scream, bop, bop.  Hey, Mike. What's going on? 
[00:55:00]  Mike in Boston, everybody.  Big setup for Mike's phone call.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I saw you guys last week at Mansfield.  It was awesome.  Yeah, we had a great time.  Detroit's this weekend.  We can't wait to get up to Detroit and do it all over again.  Tickets still available, by the way.  All right, Mike, what's up?  I just want to get my Rock Scream.  All right, let's hear it.  It's a little rough in the falsetto transition, but I like it. 
[00:55:30]  We did get a perfect one earlier this morning, which means we probably don't need any more Rock Scream.  Oh, no.  I don't think anyone's going to beat that one.  But we will allow you to wake up your roommate and hopefully get shot for doing it.  That wasn't bad, Mike.  Not bad.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Good seeing you last, what, two weeks ago at this point.  Mike!  All right.  Hey, what happened with the Met fan?  Well, this guy's a good fan.  I got to say that.  He really is. 
[00:56:00]  Some people call themselves fan.  Why?  You wear the hat, the shirt.  You walk around saying, my team's the best team.  But this guy showed he's a fan of the Metropolitans.  He's dedicated.  Went one step beyond holding up the foam hand with the finger.  Hey, can I make an observation?  Just yesterday, Anthony, you were saying that we're not savages in this country because the  Iraqi soccer team, you know, they won and they were shooting their guns in the air and they 
[00:56:30]  killed four people as the Bulls came back down to earth.  Yeah, I didn't say we weren't savages, but I said they're more savage over there.  And as far as their soccer games go and their gunfire, total savages.  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of weird that you said that yesterday and then this story pops today,  though.  This guy is not...  Well, it's not like the Mets win and 50 people go out throwing weights up in the air hoping  they come down on someone's head.  Yeah, but this wasn't even a...  Sorry.  The Mets were losing.  Yeah, but this...  Yeah, see?  But this wasn't even a World Series.  They were losing.  This wasn't the NL playoffs. 
[00:57:00]  They're the Mets.  This is a mid-season slump caused this, which Jimmy's about to say.  See what big a fan he is?  How big of a fan?  Well, the New York man has been charged with beating his mother to death with a barbell  after losing his temper while watching his baseball team lose on television.  See?  Get a reason.  Michael Anthony, who I thought was a fantastic bassist, was watching the New York Mets lose 
[00:57:30]  a game on Saturday from his home in Queens when he began furiously banging on the walls.  His father, Fred Fishman, shouted at him to stop, but Anthony punched him in the face  and threw him to the ground.  Yes.  When Anthony's mother, Maria Fishman, tried to intervene, prosecutors said he stabbed  her once in the head with a knife before chasing her into the bedroom.  This is my favorite part.  Before chasing her into the bedroom where he struck her several times with a 20-pound barbell. 
[00:58:00]  Well, here's the awfulness.  He stabs her in the head and then doesn't realize, oh my God, I just stabbed my mother.  She runs away with a knife in her head and he chases her with a 20-pound barbell to strike  her again.  To whack her over the head.  That's dedication, man.  You know what it is?  He's such a fan.  He wanted to have her head swell up and paint some stitching in it to make her look like the  mascot, Mr. Met. 
[00:58:30]  Punched his father to the ground and stabbed his mother.  In the head.  And beat her with a barbell.  And then beat her with a barbell because the Mets lost or they were losing.  Did they pull it out?  Did they win that game?  Did they start winning again?  Come on, how did you not put the final score of the game?  It's what the whole story hinges on.  It would be ironic, you see.  It would be bitter irony if he killed his mom and the Mets came back and won.  It's just like putting the rally cap on.  Right.  It's a rally cap.  Because all of a sudden people are superstitious and won't have to kill a parent whenever they're 
[00:59:00]  losing an eighth.  Of course.  You'd think the guy, I don't know, might have some issues.  He's probably been drinking.  A little drinking going on?  He's just a big fan.  How old is he?  25.  25.  You ever get really mad?  You ever get really mad because your team is losing?  You just want to hit mom over the head with a barbell?  No?  Do you realize if he lives to be 61, that's like 36 years in jail over a Mets loss. 
[00:59:30]  And you've got to just be sitting there like, maybe I went a little too far.  Yeah.  Maybe.  She just left the knife in her head and pointed and laughed at her.  Run around the house with a knife sticking out of her head.  What a jerk this guy is.  Well, that's an awful little crime.  Where was that?  In Queens.  Queens.  Well, of course, right in the shadow of Shea Stadium.  Of course.  I don't know if there was any pent-up aggression.  You'd hope so.  You'd hope that wasn't just like they had a great relationship until this. 
[01:00:00]  Just loving mother and son relationship.  Maybe they went to the movies every so often.  It was over on every holiday.  And I just kind of, you know, snapped.  Strike three cold.  Give me the barbell.  Come here.  You're going down, bitch.  That's an awful little story.  Absolutely.  You guys are just a horse's ass.  Can you imagine ever hurting your mommy?  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  Come on.  Of course not.  Jimmy, your mother's so sweet. 
[01:00:30]  I like my mom.  Hello, Jimmy.  Now, I know you are.  I love that phone call.  I can't picture hurting my parents.  I love them.  And also, they don't have enough money to justify it.  They don't like the Menendez's, where you're like, well, I think I'll grab a Porsche.  Cave their head in.  Oh, my God.  This MSNBC.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be, I guess, a news channel.  They talk about the news every so often.  And sometimes they even promo it.  They say, top of the hour, here are the stories we're working on, and we'll tell you about it when the news comes on later. 
[01:01:00]  But the news never comes on.  And it has turned into a channel I cannot tune away from.  It is the Murder Channel.  Oh, that's on the weekends.  Murder.  That's on the weekends.  They take a break from the news.  Dude, it is, I can't, I don't know if it's affecting me.  They do prison bitches, too, you know.  They do that at night.  They do prison bitches at night, and they do murder stories during the day?  But they do, like, also prison, like, guy prisons. 
[01:01:30]  They just highlight, like, a prison.  Like, hey, here's a prison in Arizona.  And then they show, like, what goes on in that prison.  But there are shows that they have where they show a murder, and then how they, like, track the people down and all that.  And it's not recreations.  They're showing dead people laying there, and not even blurred out at all.  They showed a guy in the, what's her name, Smart, the one that Pamela Smart had the kid kill her husband. 
[01:02:00]  And they showed the husband laying on the floor with his head blown off.  And, again, those feet don't know what to do when you get shot.  They just get silly.  Let's go this way.  They get silly.  All I can do is look at his shoes, and one foot was sticking out like Charlie Chaplin used to walk.  And the other one was in and twisted back.  Like, you just fall, and your feet go, bah, my brains are gone.  I don't know what to do.  Yeah, you think the muscles just go, ah, time to sleep.  Time to make funny feet.  Yeah, all right. 
[01:02:30]  I'm just going to sleep now.  I would just shot in the head.  Funny feet.  Funny feet.  One foot looks at the other and says, let's make like a banana and split.  Yeah, they just get all funny.  So Dead Body's on MSNBC, but thank God we covered up the heinies here in New York.  Cover up those heinies.  Oh, my God.  Cover up the heinies.  This is affecting the children.  The children might see heinies.  Just a little aside, and then we'll get back on your highway there.  Time Square butts out a bare-butts billboard for a toilet seat company. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Had its assets covered.  Assets.  I get it.  In Times Square, when the firm and a local church announced a court settlement yesterday  to conceal the naughty bits of the racy ad.  Basically, it was just a bunch of very nice-looking butts.  It was asses.  Yeah, it was naked people.  From, like, the shoulders to just above the knee.  Yeah, and it was advertising a toilet seat, I guess?  Yeah.  And it was a lot of outrage here in New York City, and they finally decided to cover up 
[01:03:30]  the heinies.  But Dead Bodies on MSNBC is okay.  Dead Bodies.  How about just walking around New York City?  You won't see a billboard with heinies.  You'll see a nasty homeless one leaning against the wall as he relieves himself.  If you're lucky, it's against the wall somewhere.  Sometimes it's right at the intersection.  Right next to the old garbage pad.  Well, they need something to lean their back against like they're sitting.  So it's a mailbox, a garbage bin, or a fire hydrant brick walls. 
[01:04:00]  I told you about that one by the parking garage that I just watched decompose for a year.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  It was like a science experiment.  Should have taken a picture every day.  Homeless guy drops a deuce.  Time-lapse.  You should have taken a picture.  Yeah, time-lapse.  It would have been great.  And everyone refused to clean it up, so it sat there for a year.  It just sat there for a year, a year, until it was nothing left but like this, like it  looked like cigar paper, like what you roll a cigar in.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  There was nothing left to this thing.  And then it blew away in the wind.  Just dust in the wind.  Did you have anything else on MSNBC?  I'm watching these shows, and I don't know if, because I'll watch them for hours on end,  one after another.  And I don't know, does that affect you in any way?  Can watching these brutal murders and the detailed descriptions of them affect you?  Depends on how.  I mean, if all of a sudden you stand up and there's a tent in your sweats, I'd say you should  stop watching them for a while. 
[01:05:00]  No, because I'm like, I don't know why I love watching these shows.  They're kind of cool, like to watch and know exactly, like all the details.  You want to know all the details of these heinous murders.  Like I want to know, I just don't want to know.  And the person was stabbed or shot.  I want to know where, how many times, where they were left.  Show me the picture a little bit.  What was the motive?  Yeah, and then the motive, and then you find out who did it, and you're like, oh, I bet  it was that husband guy, or the boyfriend, or like the rapist. 
[01:05:30]  There was this rapist, and he was raping these women, and they got DNA on him.  And they're like, oh, the DNA is a slam dunk.  We got this guy.  They arrest him, because he's outside a woman's window, and the woman chases him away.  And she's in the neighborhood.  This is another thing.  You'll find stupid people on these shows.  The woman chases him away, and doesn't call the cops, knowing that there's a rapist in  the area.  As long as it was away from her window, let someone else get raped, I guess was her logic. 
[01:06:00]  So then the guy comes back, and starts peering in her window again, so then she decides to  call the cops.  They arrest him, and through DNA, they find out he was the rapist.  So they go, we got him.  Turns out, here comes the guy's identical twin brother.  They have the exact same DNA.  Is that possible?  Yeah, twin brothers will have the same DNA.  So now they're trying to pin it on the brother, and the brother's saying it's not him, it's  the other brother.  So now you've got to prove to a jury that it's one and not the other. 
[01:06:30]  How did they prove it?  They did through a tattoo.  One guy had a tattoo, and the other guy had some sort of almost like a Mike Tyson lift  that the women that were raped never mentioned.  So it was close.  It could have gone either way.  Did they mention the fact that it might be the guy who was peering in the window at four  in the morning?  Exactly, that's what I was saying.  It's like, why was that?  But they said, they said just because he was doing that doesn't mean he raped these other  women.  It's like, well, yes it does. 
[01:07:00]  Lock them both up.  Exactly.  That's it.  Guilty.  Wow.  But those shows, I'm just thinking, can they affect you?  You watch so much of that, and it's so violent, and I don't know why I like them so much.  I don't know.  I guess they can.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're sort of desensitized.  Because after, I watched like eight hours of them one day, and my girlfriend's just like,  are you still watching these?  You know?  Well, how about this?  And she'll watch them and go, you know, I had to turn it off. 
[01:07:30]  It got to the point where I had to turn it off.  How about this?  Are you addicted to milk?  No, I hate milk.  It's disgusting.  Then it can't affect you.  No?  Nah.  Why?  Got milk.  What about it?  That campaigns everywhere.  Yeah?  Are you drinking more milk?  No, I hate it.  All right, there you go.  So it doesn't affect you.  But I like murder.  Maybe.  It could be.  I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  If we were easily influenced, we'd all be drinking just a ridiculous amount of milk at  this point.  That's true.  With those dumb got milk ads.  Yeah.  If just being bludgeoned by advertising worked on everybody, yeah, that would have done something.  Everybody would have been drinking milk.  But it's being pointed out to me, Sam is addicted to milk.  Well.  But that Sam hasn't grown past the age of eight for some reason.  He eats like a little eight-year-old with his fish sticks, his chicken tenders, and his 
[01:08:30]  hot wings.  Yeah.  And then his dessert.  What did he do when he was out in San Diego?  I don't know.  Holy jeez.  What did he do to eat?  That could be our big radio tease after the break.  Wow.  What did Sam eat in San Diego?  I want to know what he did because he didn't have his normal supply of chicken tenders.  He was out there for Comic-Con.  He might have had to eat real adult food.  Yeah, blech.  Where do you find your eight-year-old food when you're on the road? 
[01:09:00]  Alone.  All alone.  So many questions.  Did you have a stick with a bandana tied on it with all your food in it?  Like you were running away?  Like Spanky?  You child.  By the way, I didn't want to interrupt you.  I'm trying to interrupt you last night, but Ralph did have a good line from Belleville,  New Jersey.  Chris Benoit must have been a Tampa Bay Devil's Ray fan.  Oh, well.  Or Tampa Bay Devil Rays fan. 
[01:09:30]  That story didn't have legs, that Benoit thing.  No one really seemed to care.  A lot of people cared.  They care about the dogs more.  A lot of people cared.  A lot of people cared.  Well, they don't see it.  It's not like in the news.  Well, because they hosed it down and moved on to the next story.  That's what we do.  Steroids.  Steroid rage.  Well, they're investigating wrestling again as far as all that goes.  Whatever.  Why don't we take a break?  Move on to some other things.  Don't forget.  My God. 
[01:10:00]  It's far away phone call Tuesday.  I don't really see.  South Dakota's pretty far.  Not if you live in South Dakota.  It's also Hummer Tuesday.  It's also Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  We haven't had any diabolical laughs.  Now, we'll check some of these off after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning. 
[01:10:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Detroit?  We're coming your way this Saturday.  We certainly are.  O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show hits Detroit this Saturday.  Virus Tour.  One word on MySpace.  Eight or nine comedians you know from the show.  The O&A Village.  The tailgating.  The debauchery.  What are we on?  Three different flights?  Are we really?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I think we are coming back.  This travel thing is getting old.  I'm doing a signing Friday night if I could core myself. 
[01:11:00]  What, Jimmy?  It's breaking news, ladies and gents.  Oh, my God.  I heard this will leave us with no downtime between the airport and the hotel.  What?  Jimmy's signing.  If we join you at the signing.  Oh, if you can.  It's all if you can.  I never want to mention.  If?  We'll be there, Jimmy.  Oh, 730 on Friday.  Borders 34300 Woodward in Birmingham, Michigan.  I'll be signing happy endings.  If you want a signature with my signature also, be there between 730 and 740 because I am leaving. 
[01:11:30]  Open and you don't understand.  They never sign together.  So if you want to open, it's 740 to 750.  We barely acknowledge that the other one exists at this point.  You're lucky that we're in the same room.  I'm flying in.  Can I get back to my Led Zeppelin riff?  Okay.  Now that you got.  All right.  That's where we were. 
[01:12:00]  Also, we're doing local TV in Detroit.  Saturday morning.  Yeah.  What's this show like?  I don't know.  It's a Fox thing, so it's got to be wacky.  It's going to be silly.  It's got to be a wacky morning TV thing.  Yeah.  Where they joke around.  It's not all serious news.  So they're going to have us on?  And the guy that's doing it is a jock?  Yeah.  It'll be fine.  It's like taking over the news show or some weird thing they're doing.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:12:30]  That's cool.  Station hooked enough.  It's kind of exciting.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  Not as exciting as being on Jimmy Kimmel like Jim Norton will be this coming Wednesday.  I wish I was doing it tonight.  Sharon Osbourne's on tonight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I fly.  I'm doing it with Mark Anthony and somebody else.  I was wondering, why no Jay Leno for your book, Happy Endings?  Because, honestly...  I actually was dreaming this last night out of nowhere.  Were you?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Like, we were doing our radio show, and you were leaving to do Jay Leno to discuss your Happy Endings book.  Did you wake up and have to change the sheets? 
[01:13:00]  Did a counselor come in and say, it's normal?  I thought it was downright creepy.  I'm like, why am I dreaming of Jim Norton tonight?  Well, it's...  No, no.  Leno is because they didn't know if they could get me in October, and HBO premieres October  13th, and we kind of...  I would rather do Leno for that.  Oh, look.  He's got choices.  Hey.  Stupid me.  Well, Leno's the biggest show going.  I mean...  It's awesome, Jimmy.  And Jimmy Kimmel I've never done, and I wanted to do Jimmy Kimmel, and they've actually requested  that I do it.  And, of course, I want to do it.  We had a great relationship with Jimmy Kimmel. 
[01:13:30]  It went horribly wrong because of our stupid program director that was completely useless  back in the day.  It was him, yeah.  And Jimmy is holding us sort of responsible, which is a shame.  I like Jimmy Kimmel.  I hope we can work it out someday, but, I mean, you know, Jimmy's going to be on Jimmy  Kimmel tomorrow night.  It was Gary, the PD.  Jimmy Kimmel can go screw.  No.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  That's all right.  Jimmy's panicking over there.  He's like, you can say all this tomorrow or Thursday.  Shut up.  I say absolutely that, no, I couldn't agree more. 
[01:14:00]  Lex and Terry.  I want to thank you guys.  Come on.  It was the Ice Cream PD, though.  Yeah.  And they finally, like, fired him, and then Jimmy Kimmel actually, I respect him because  he called our show to tell us that he's never doing our show again.  Because he was friends with the Ice Cream PD.  Really good friends with the Ice Cream PD.  It's like, well, we didn't get him fired.  Ice Cream PD kind of discovered Jimmy Kimmel back in the day when Jimmy was doing radio stuff. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  So they had, like, a relationship there.  And since he wasn't working at our station and our station, as he sees it screwed him  over, then he wasn't going to do anything on our station.  It was a shame because we did some really good radio with Jimmy back in the day.  Yeah.  We did a lot of football stuff and other things.  The only thing good that came out of stupid Ice Cream PD was probably that one money shot  that made that daughter of his.  Jesus H. Christ.  Remember he used to bring her in every so often? 
[01:15:00]  He would bring in his daughter and go, hey, you know, could you just keep an eye on her  or something?  And then he'd go out and interview more female producers.  With big bosoms.  Yeah.  With big bosoms.  And he'd leave the daughter there.  And this girl couldn't have been more than 14.  15.  She was already, like, 5'11".  And she'd model material.  And she was stunning.  She'd come in and just, like, you know, suck on lollipops and tell us that she's going  to the Britney Spears concert. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  And that she wants to go to the modeling school.  Yeah.  And then our Ice Cream PD would make us babysit her while we're trying to do a radio show  for adults.  Hope everybody was good.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, we were cursing in front of your little girl, saying awful things.  Not when we were on the air.  Off the air.  In the green room.  You know, I had to do my act on the phone last night.  For who?  Producer.  You have to.  It's for ABC's Practicing Standards.  Holy jeez.  I could have emailed it.  That's impossible. 
[01:16:00]  No, but I didn't mind.  I actually.  Impossible.  Did you actually do it as you would do it?  No.  That would be hilarious if you're just in your apartment.  I took the pauses.  Ba-da.  Yeah.  In your apartment with your cell phone.  No, you have.  They want every word.  I wasn't going to write.  I told my manager.  I'm not writing every word out.  It's just time-consuming and stupid.  So do you say it just monotone and kind of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's funny.  I got a text from my girlfriend and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Some things don't translate without being performed.  Yeah.  Like this one line I say, it's like, you know, if you're arguing and nobody talks louder  than this, like that's the way I'm saying, but it doesn't look good in written form and 
[01:16:30]  nobody talks louder than this.  Right.  What is this?  It's written.  It's not even great spoken.  Right.  It's mediocre spoken.  It's awful written and maybe a two on the laugh scale spoken.  Well, Jimmy's going to be on Jimmy Kimmel tomorrow night.  We're all excited for that.  Make sure you check that out.  Okay.  You were dreaming about that.  Yeah.  It was creepy.  You know.  I wouldn't even.  Throw me under the bus.  I don't care.  I'm telling you, it was creepy and I acknowledge it.  It's not creepy dreaming about your friends.  Dreaming about your friends in a sexual way, but dreaming about your buddy going out to 
[01:17:00]  do television and Hollywood is nice.  I wouldn't acknowledge dreaming about any of you guys.  Why?  Whether I did or not.  I dreamt about you.  So what?  Have you?  Yes.  Was it sexy?  You had a dress on.  See, that's the worst thing.  Like when I dream that I'm in my underwear or you're outside just naked for some reason.  Yeah.  And of course, everyone can translate that dream.  You know what that means.  You're kind of, you know, insecure.  You have some insecurities about something. 
[01:17:30]  So I'm outside naked and people I know are around.  And it's just embarrassing when you wake up, even when you're awake.  How could you still be embarrassed when you wake up from a dream?  But I am.  It's like, oh, I was just naked.  Because you're like, oh, no, they found out that I'm queer.  They saw me naked.  Oh, thank God.  It's a dream.  My secret is still mine.  Oh, hey, we got an expert on the phone as far as the Michael Vick thing goes. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, a true.  Expert.  We've been waiting for this phone call all morning long.  It's Marge from the Little Shelter out there on Long Island.  Oh, Marge.  What's up, Marge?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Marge.  Marge.  How are you?  Very good.  Before you get started, Marge, Marge, before you get started, I have a question to ask you.  Yes?  Now, I saw a story on the Little Shelter on the news the other day. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  And they went through about four people that worked at the Little Shelter and were showing  the cattery and everything else.  And we were waiting for Marge to show her face on the news.  Is this part of the snip and tuck program that they were talking about?  You were nowhere to be found.  I actually was there that day, but they wanted to speak to the vet and they wanted to speak  to other people that were more familiar with the program.  No, I'm thinking you don't even work at Little Shelter and that you weren't there that day 
[01:19:00]  and that you're like a Little Shelter stalker.  You're just a cat kook.  Gentlemen.  Yes.  Yes.  To show you that I work at Little Shelter, I am going to be there on Saturday.  Oh, boy.  August 19th.  She's getting good with the plugs.  For our big Adopt-a-thon.  Check that thing.  Adopt-a-thon?  What's a thon?  Hey, can I run the Michael Vick Challenge?  Now, wait a minute. 
[01:19:30]  Just hold on.  The reason I called today is really...  Hey, Marge, I want to run the Michael Vick Challenge.  You know that Michael Vick story?  Yes, of course.  How funny is that one?  Oh, is that one a scream?  I beg of you, let me just answer.  Okay, go ahead.  How funny is the Michael Vick situation?  Drowning the pit bulls.  My God.  Go ahead, Marge.  What I suggest you do, rather than take up your precious time on the air, why don't  you all go on www.littleshelter.com and see what our official answer, official reason 
[01:20:00]  for saying that this is the worst story we ever heard.  Oh, let's go there.  Ever.  Ever.  What about 9-11?  All right.  Now, wait a minute.  What about 9-11?  And Steven S. from Bayshore, he writes, hey, Ope, is it really true that Marge is changing  the name to the Little Slaughterhouse?  What about the Holocaust?  God damn.  That's worse than the Holocaust?  Did she just say, God damn?  She's getting frisky.  We are not comparing.  We have to compare apples and apples. 
[01:20:30]  Did I just hear Marge, a worker at the little shelter, say that the Michael Vick story is  worse than the Holocaust?  Do you know how many Jews this is going to upset?  Yeah, Marge, what's wrong with you?  Marge, 6 million Jews and a few pit bulls?  And how many Iranians are going to be upset because they never think the Holocaust happened?  Right.  There's no comparison here.  No comparison?  Now she's saying there's not even a comparison here, that the dogs are much worse.  Let us stick to the issue.  The issue being... 
[01:21:00]  Hey, let's go to your website.  Thank you.  Go to the website.  Ingrid, the Viagra dog, looking for that special someone.  Okay, no.  A storybook ending.  The letter from the president.  Can't adopt, become a sponsor.  Hey, wouldn't Ingrid make a good fighter?  Would Ingrid make a good fighting dog?  Ingrid is not feeling well right now.  We're all very distressed.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with Ingrid, the Viagra dog?  How much time?  Let us not make fun of Ingrid.  Do you have a cat that can sense death?  Is it curling up near Ingrid, like that one at the nursing home? 
[01:21:30]  Have you found, have you found...  You didn't do your research before you allowed a guy named Michael to adopt this dog in Georgia?  Gentlemen, can I please tell you why I'm calling, for God's sake?  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Okay, Marge, talk.  All right.  On Saturday, August 18th, this is why I called.  I didn't even want to get on the air.  Well, too bad.  What I said was, can you guys send me an Opie and Anthony t-shirt?  Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Can we?  Would we? 
[01:22:00]  And I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because there are so many people that are emailing us at Little Shelter and snail mailing us about wanting to meet Marge.  You're a celebrity.  You're a celebrity, Marge.  I am a celebrity, thanks to the two of you, and I thank you very much.  All right, listen.  Little Shelter condemns dog fighting and animal abuse.  There it is.  A letter from our president.  There you go.  Yeah.  So what's wrong with Ingrid, the Viagra dog?  We're hoping that it's just a little virus, but her heart, I don't know. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, boy.  We're worried about her.  Nothing works here.  And I want everybody to stop making fun of her and say a prayer for her.  Marge, can I ask you a question?  Now, this is very serious.  Yeah.  You collected hundreds, if not thousands, of Viagra tablets for this dog.  What happens if, God forbid, the dog passes away?  Let's not even say it.  I'm not even going to say it.  Okay.  Don't think about it.  What will you do with all the Viagra?  We'll wait and see if we ever get another dog that needs the same.  Uh-huh. 
[01:23:00]  You're all going to have boners walking around Little Shelter.  Marge, why aren't you taking our advice?  You could be selling those pills out of the back door of the Little Shelter.  You could make a fine profit on the Viagra pills.  New roof for the cattery?  Yeah.  Come on, honey.  Opie, listen to me.  What happened, darling?  I beg of you.  Get it, darling?  Oh, she's begging.  She's over 60.  Takes you back to yesterday.  She's begging.  I understand.  Uh, yes.  What?  Yes.  All right.  Okay.  So, I will be at Little Shelter on Saturday, August 18th, hopefully wearing your t-shirt, 
[01:23:30]  hopefully talking to everybody.  I have never, you may think.  My brother's going to make you a special t-shirt, Marge.  You have no idea, gentlemen.  He's going to say pet killer on the back.  How many people in your listening audience love animals and that come to my defense.  All right.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  It's incredible.  So, when is Ingrid going to die from this heart failure thing?  Ingrid is not going to die.  We just have to see exactly what's wrong and pull it through as we've done before.  Marge, I have a question. 
[01:24:00]  I'm an animal lover.  Now, like, what-  Who am I speaking to?  This is Jim.  I just come in once in a while.  Okay.  Hi, Jim.  Good evening.  You actually sound normal.  Yeah.  My question is this, though, as an animal lover.  You should be on the ball, Marge.  Well, you have Ingrid, right?  Who's a dog who's got-  What will you do with the pills?  Like, if Ingrid, let's just say, dies, as you're shoveling that little grave in the  back, you know, what will you do with the pills?  We will keep the pills. 
[01:24:30]  Let me ask you, Marge, honestly, would you bury Ingrid, or are you probably just going  to put her through the incinerator?  No, we're going to bury her.  We have a cemetery that's adjacent to the little shelter.  It's a beautiful, beautiful place.  Yeah, but you're running out of plots, aren't you, Marge?  You're psycho.  First of all, guys, you can see the creeps.  It's a mass grave over there.  Hey, get a backhoe.  What the hell's going on there?  She marched.  I got a line.  I'll be the first grave I dug.  If she does pass, she will have a very, very special place in the cemetery. 
[01:25:00]  A headstone?  You people are horrible.  A headstone for a dog?  Yes.  You know, you guys hand me a leg.  Why don't you ever come over there and see for yourself what we do?  I've been to the little shelter.  As well, did you see the cemetery?  I couldn't fit through the door. 
[01:25:30]  It's literally little.  Did you see the cemetery where Foxy is buried?  Yes.  What does it say on Foxy's grave?  I just saw the place.  No, no, no.  I want to hear.  What is it?  Where I buried little Cage, and then he came out and stabbed me in the ankle with scissors.  And I know the cemetery you guys have, it's a big green dumpster.  And what you do is, you take the little dog and kitten bodies, and you pile him up in  the dumpster, and then the truck comes and takes him away. 
[01:26:00]  And it smells bad, and no one in the neighborhood likes you, because you're criminals.  And benches, and people come there, and they...  And they reflect.  And they find...  You're not big on the whole give and take thing on the phone, are you, Marge?  They find solace?  Solace.  They find solace in...  Do they?  ...the silence and the peace of the cemetery.  It's creepy.  Oh, I thought she said they find solids, something they don't in her diapers.  Gentlemen.  Yes.  Are you going to send me a t-shirt or not? 
[01:26:30]  Marge, I will never be at the little shelter, because I'm allergic to pets and old broads.  Well, you don't have to go into the shelter.  You can stand out...  I'm very, very allergic, but...  You can stand in the cemetery.  If you want to make some kind of Viagra deal, I might be able to show up.  Well, why don't you come over, and we'll talk about it.  No.  Well, she drives a hard bargain.  I know, right?  You know, you guys are all talk, all talk and no action.  Here I am, giving you the opportunity.  We're going to send you a t-shirt.  All right. 
[01:27:00]  I'll bet you right now she's naked on a rotary phone.  Oh, would that be great?  How sexy.  It's a pair of Nike sneakers, no clothing.  Hey, uh...  Why don't you have...  Oh, wait, kitty cam on CW11.  Hold on, Marge.  Oh, they're showing little cats on CW11.  Are those some of your victims?  Maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe we did send somebody in.  Oh, are they adorable?  Yeah.  Listen, uh...  Kitty cat.  Ah, what's that?  It's a cat happy birthday.  Oh, that's Linda Church.  What size...  What size are you sending me? 
[01:27:30]  Uh, extra, extra large?  No.  For Marge?  No.  Large, Marge.  You got a big rack on you, though.  I saw your, uh, picture.  What do I look...  You got, like, those torpedo ones from the 50s.  What do you look like?  You, um...  You were showing your legs.  Your legs were crossed in the picture,  and you were showing some legs.  You were wearing a skirt.  No, I know why they're crossed.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Because I...  A lot of people like you guys.  Ah, because there's a lot of people like us.  Why?  All right, now...  Marge, something tells me with your...  I didn't see that hair, 
[01:28:00]  because your legs were crossed.  So, Marge, we're going to give you a plug.  You're saying that he...  Our legs are crossed.  The North Shore Animal League  is what we should be concentrating on.  The North Shore Animal League  we should be helping, correct?  What?  The North Shore Animal League...  What?  Are you out of your mind?  ...is right now on CW11,  and Marge is the supporter,  and I say that, like,  if you want to help Ingrid,  it's the North Shore Animal League.  Oh, you are so miserable.  What's wrong with the North Shore Animal League? 
[01:28:30]  They're good.  That's what...  They're good people, Marge.  They're helping Ingrid.  They're helping, uh...  They have a kitty...  Hey, they have a kitty cam.  I don't see your kitty cam.  We are on Channel 11  once every six weeks.  Johnny the Cat?  Don't say that.  They're doing an adopt-a-thon  over at North Shore.  North Shore Animal League.  North Shore Animal League.  He's doing an adopt-a-thon.  At least they're not pumping their dogs  and cats with Viagra,  you sick F, Marge.  You're a sick F.  It's, I don't know,  go to North Shore Animal League 
[01:29:00]  and find out when their adopt-a-thon is.  Huh?  You know what?  You guys,  you have to be ashamed of yourselves.  You know that you love Little Shelter.  You know you love the animals,  and you know...  Oh, my God,  what's that smell?  But you are deliberately...  Ingrid.  Marge, close your legs.  I can't take it.  Oh, Marge.  You know I'm going to have to get back  on that oxygen again.  Marge.  Marge, listen to me.  Why?  What's your take on the Michael Vick thing?  Why don't we get something done  with your phone call for once?  I think it's just disgusting  that people are so low-life 
[01:29:30]  that they want to do something horrible  to animals and provoke them into fighting.  Yeah.  You know,  when kids are displaying  this kind of terrible behavior,  it's always an indication.  Why don't I say...  Michael Vick is a kid?  No, I'm talking about children.  When they display...  Children fighting.  That sounds fun.  Ooh, children fighting.  This shows what's going on in their mind  and what might happen to them 
[01:30:00]  as they get older.  All right, Marge,  very important question.  Is this worse than rape?  Why do you always pin me to the wall?  All right.  Speaking of rape.  That sounds nice.  I mean,  Marge doesn't like a big dog  unless it has oven mitts on.  Each thing is a German shepherd  with oven mitts.  And she's a happy old lady  with a David Carradine body.  Duct taped to their little front paws.  You know she's awful.  She's hair like one of the Doobie Brothers.  You know,  I would like to sit down with you guys 
[01:30:30]  and once let you listen to me  for one minute.  Oh, we've been listening to you.  We listen.  You preach about your cats and your dogs.  You do a wonderful service.  Yes, Marge,  we're going to give you the big plug.  North Shore Animal League,  25 Davis Avenue in Port Washington.  516-883-7575.  Jim.  Help Ingrid the dog.  Call of the North Shore Animal League.  They're not cruel to their animals  like some other places are.  Are you allowing him to do that?  He certainly is. 
[01:31:00]  We need to break.  North Shore Animal League,  25 Davis Avenue.  Do you guys have like softball games?  Like the North Shore Animal League  against the little shelter murderers.  And you use like animal carcasses  as the bases.  You slide it in the second.  Your cleats dig into a cat's face.  We can't control them, Marge.  Little kitten baseballs.  We can't control them.  I'm sorry.  They spray paint kitten heads as balls.  And you have to make a possum bitch.  Marge.  Marge.  I got a question for you, Marge. 
[01:31:30]  A possum bitch.  How many pets does Marge have?  Personally.  Oh.  Good question.  Why do I have to answer that question?  Well, it's, it's, it's, I want to know.  You got a couple dogs, a couple cats.  What do you got, Marge?  Nine dogs.  Nine dogs.  Wow.  They have to take turns with Marge in rotation.  Not on sleeping duty tonight, pal.  Not me.  Now, there's no, there's no secret that.  Not a jar of peanut butter in the house left.  Stop it.  There's no secret, Marge,  that you're getting up there in years, right? 
[01:32:00]  I don't, what do you mean no secret?  I'm still living.  There's no secret.  Do you actually look around when you're by yourself with your dogs  and wonder which dog is going to end up eating you when you,  when you die?  Nibbling on your face.  Nibbling on your face.  You know, during the time you died and someone discovers that,  which could be up to two to three weeks.  You understand that, right?  Something tells me not many people calling you are banging on your door.  I give up.  Except for the big softball game,  the North Shore Animal League against the Little Shelter Slaughterers. 
[01:32:30]  I give up.  The North Shore Animal League helpers against the Little Shelter Slaughterers.  Is that your listeners, your listeners are nicer than you.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  Why don't you go to an Opie and Anthony event?  Yeah.  Why don't we bring you up on stage at the PNC show or something?  Yeah.  If you want to...  Hey, can we get a cat to sacrifice at the PNC comedy show we're doing August 25th?  Can I come to the show?  Yeah.  And what? 
[01:33:00]  We want to take a cat and throw him into the audience.  No, no, no.  And have him bounce him around like a beach ball.  And we won't start the show until the carcass comes back on the stage.  You know, wait a minute.  How about if we need animals to be on the show with...  What?  Oh, forget it.  What?  All I want to know is, number one, would you send me a size medium in a T-shirt?  Hmm.  Oh, my God. 
[01:33:30]  That cat.  Look.  There we go.  Sorry, Marge.  You were saying...  Sorry, Marge.  I had to whack a cat over the head with a shovel.  Sorry.  What were you saying, Marge?  This question is to any normal person on your show.  Yeah.  Of which there are a few, but far between.  Yes.  But anyway, please send a medium-sized T-shirt to Little Shelter at 33...  I think it sounds angry.  Whoa, what the heck is going on?  Here's the solution.  Here's what I want to send to Little Shelter. 
[01:34:00]  There it goes.  All right.  You were saying, Marge.  Here's what I'm going to do.  Yeah.  If people would like to have their picture taken with me that day...  Yeah.  You posing in front of the hearse?  All right.  Oh.  Aw.  We can have...  Aw.  Two, three, four...  Big litter.  Five, six...  Oh, this one's getting away.  Seven, eight... 
[01:34:30]  Don't go anywhere.  Nine, ten little kittens.  Aw, look at them.  Anthony.  Yes?  They looked so frightened.  How about stopping by on Saturday?  All right.  So long, Marge.  So long.  So long.  Huh?  Hello?  Shut...  Oh, look.  I found another one. 
[01:35:00]  Aw, look at it.  They can't swim.  Look at those big kitten farheads sink.  Okay.  Okay.  Three, four...  I'm just going to hit the burlap sack full for a while.  And then just toss the whole thing in.  There they go.  I have a deal for you.  Couple for good measure.  Just in case any are moving.  Why don't... 
[01:35:30]  And look at some of the kitties and the puppies.  All right, Marge.  And if you don't find...  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Oh, I had to take these out a little further.  There we go.  Let's get out of here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're here with everyone else. 
[01:36:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  I got to explain radio to somebody.  What?  Someone on their cell phone.  Why are you guys...  I hate to tear down a wall.  It kind of sucks.  But you know what?  It's worth it sometimes.  We're going to tear down a wall today.  The fifth wall.  Let's tear down the fifth wall of radio today.  Oh, that sleep's four.  I can't see.  I hope it's not the floor.  We'll fall straight into the basement. 
[01:36:30]  Got to explain radio to this guy or girl from their cell phone.  They write,  Why are you guys always such a-holes to Marge?  She is doing good things and you are just so effing crude.  Yes.  Marge and the shelter don't deserve that, even in jest.  Right.  That's from the cell phone of Marge.  Marge.  Yeah, probably, right?  This is how it...  And I explain it this way.  You got to explain radio sometimes.  We would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever take a phone call from Marge from the little 
[01:37:00]  shelter and have just a normal conversation with her.  Ew.  Why?  Boring!  Why bother?  And I hate to tear down the wall, but we beat the crap out of her, you know, and just get  completely insane with her, and guess what?  In the end, everyone knows Marge from the little shelter out there on Long Island, and  guess what?  We've heard donations are up because of Marge's appearances on our show.  Of course.  She's a star now.  We know her as Marge, but the little animals there know her as the boot. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  They call her Marge Mangala.  We get some sick, funny radio, and she gets some publicity for her little, you know, joint.  She's made little cat skin lampshades are all over her house.  Full kitty holocaust.  She probably wears, like, little cat trinkets, like, uh, she wears a hat made of cat skin.  Little cat tooth earrings. 
[01:38:00]  This shouldn't please me, but it does.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  There's a McDonald's drops rapper from tour, uh, rapper Twista, who was tap, uh, not Twista.  Yes.  Is that like Twister, but only with an uh at the end?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That's how you know it's black, is if the ER comes off and it becomes a.  Yes.  That's people's way of saying this is black.  Yeah.  Um, when, when, uh, someone gets shot, do they go, ah, we got to take him to the, uh.  Oh, please. 
[01:38:30]  I don't get it.  Please hold on.  Oh, the ER.  Ah, there you go.  Oh, all right.  Good crash.  That stunk.  Um, yeah, I guess his lyrics were a little objectionable, but they're like a, although we  expect, uh, McDonald's, although we respect free speech and expression.  We do not condone or perpetuate derogatory language.  And, uh, this, this rapper, uh, blamed the criticism, uh, on hip hop in the wake of the  racial flap over Don Imus's, uh, you know, we all know what he did. 
[01:39:00]  And, uh, he's saying, I've been rapping the same way for 15 years.  It only became a problem when Don Imus said something negative about black women and they  needed a scapegoat.  Oh.  So, uh, I think it's great.  It's like hip hop, you know, and Patrice called it.  Uh, he was the first one that made it.  He said, hip hop, you're next.  He was saying, no, you dumb MFs.  Look at what you're doing.  Yeah.  You, you, you, you, these rappers and, and other people in the black community that are  calling for Imus to be fired or that were, uh, Patrice said it. 
[01:39:30]  He goes, what are you stupid?  He goes, they're coming for you next.  They're coming for you next.  Dummies, shut up.  And they got, it was, it was all about like a lot of times black people don't want to  speak against the party line.  Yeah.  Like you don't want to be seen signing with a white guy publicly over the black people.  You just.  Exactly.  It's a no, no.  So instead of coming out for free speech, like comedians did, like DL.  Yeah.  Um, no, he should be fired.  That's what Steve said.  Should be fired.  Oh yeah.  I'd fire that guy. 
[01:40:00]  And now, uh, they come after them and look, you lost a gig.  Lost a big gig.  Good.  That's a huge gig.  Dummies.  All right.  Why don't we, uh, why don't we take our far away phone call?  It is far away.  Oh, Tuesday.  All right.  Uh, last time we, uh, took a far away phone call.  We, um, we, uh, were lied to by the caller and we exposed him.  Right.  We exposed him.  Hold on a minute.  We got to make this official.  Hold, hold, hold, hold the phone there.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  It's far away phone call Tuesday.  Yay!  Today's far away phone call comes from Bulgaria.  Hmm.  Charlie.  Sure.  What the hell is that?  Yes, that's me.  Yeah.  What?  Can you, can you, can you guys hear me?  Barely.  Yeah.  What's up, Charlie?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, just, uh, just calling in.  Uh, I'm calling from Bulgaria. 
[01:41:00]  I, uh, been listening to you guys ever since, uh, Jimmy's Columbine ran a few years ago.  Um, um, I'm a, uh, so you know, I'm a Peace Corps volunteer over here.  A Peace Corps volunteer.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Uh, what time is it over there?  It is, uh, 3.22, about, well, I've got to check.  Yeah, 3.22 in the afternoon.  In the afternoon?  3.22 p.m.  Well, 3.20, you know, in the afternoon. 
[01:41:30]  All right, so I'm looking.  You think I'm joking.  It's about 2.20 in Berlin.  He's right.  You'd be there.  Okay, I'll give you the, uh, benefit of the doubt.  So far, so good.  Yeah, that does look good.  Where are you right now?  Uh, I'm in, uh, this town called Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria.  No, I wouldn't know where that is.  I'm calling on a...  Well, exactly.  They went, why are you at?  Now, how did you...  No, I mean, where are you?  Are you in your, like, apartment? 
[01:42:00]  No, I'm calling from a, uh, one of these, uh, phone cab...  Uh, these little phone booths, yeah.  Oh, a phone booth.  All right.  They still got phone booths there.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, they got phone booths.  How do you listen to the...  How do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show in Bulgaria?  Through the, uh, K-Rock website, streaming, uh, the streaming audio.  Oh, how about that?  92.3 K-Rock.com.  Look at that.  And you listen to the show, and you're the faraway phone caller.  Wait, you know something? 
[01:42:30]  I'm, uh, I'm believing him.  No, I want to talk to some Bulgarian.  Is there a Bulgarian on the street?  Yeah, well, I mean, there's a, there's a girl that's outside right here, but...  Yeah, why don't you, all right, give it, give us, give us the girl.  Okay.  Okay, just, just one second, then.  All right.  All right.  Let's do that old guy.  Okay.  Jimmy, you got it?  Yeah.  I don't understand. 
[01:43:00]  Allo?  Allo?  Allo?  She doesn't want to, unfortunately.  She's a real hot chick, but I, there's one girl who's working here, and unfortunately,  she doesn't want to talk.  Oh.  Sorry.  I mean, I could, it's, it's just that we, you guys wouldn't know what they were saying.  What are you doing?  Well, that's the beauty of this.  I would just say, allo.  Yeah, if she starts talking in that weird language, we're like, okay, I think this guy's 
[01:43:30]  telling the truth.  What do they speak in Bulgaria?  Well, I mean, you know, it's a, what, pardon?  What language?  Bulgarianese.  They speak Bulgarianese.  Yeah, Bulgarianese.  Yeah, it's like, it's a Slavic language.  It's a Slavic.  Right.  All right, is there anyone else around?  There's a, there's one, there's another guy in here, he looks like he's shopping for  something.  All right, let's see if we can talk to him.  Let's see either.  Let's see if we can talk to him.  Well, actually, this girl's free, if you want to, if you want to talk to her. 
[01:44:00]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Tell her she won a, she doesn't want it.  Just tell her she won a prize or something.  Just tell her she won a prize.  Yeah, whatever they like over there, a bag of apples.  It's probably a month's pay.  Patch is always good.  Just get her on the phone, Charlie, please.  Okay, just, just a sec.  There's something close to Bulgarian?  Hmm?  No, it's, it's in the Portuguese.  It's an island.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  Bulgaria's an island, south of Hawaii. 
[01:44:30]  Maybe I'll just speak something through her.  Janiska, Janiska, she doesn't want to.  She's, she's, she's here.  Do you want to hear her say something?  Yeah, yeah, just, just, just, just scream out.  Yeah, just have her yell something.  Okay.  Second.  Yellow.  You can hear it.  No, more.  Can I hear her?  Did you hear any of that?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Sounded like babble to us.  Yeah.  Where are you from in the States? 
[01:45:00]  Sunny Rochester, New York.  Oh, look at that.  The home of Brother Weiss.  And you're there doing what?  Peace Corps?  It's a community, it's, well, Community and Organizational Development is the official title.  Got us a crusader.  You know, I'm here to, what's that?  Is it a nudist colony?  Nudist colony?  The beaches are nude.  Oh.  How, how far from the United States are you?  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, geez, I've had.  Five grand?  Maybe 15,000 miles?  I have no idea.  15,000 miles?  I'm not that far.  It's fast to go in the other way.  Really?  Which 15,000, you can't be 15,000 miles away from someone on the earth.  You might want to turn right.  You're 10,000 miles away.  You might want to turn right if you think it's 15,000.  15,000 miles away, you're 10,000 miles away.  That means you're really five miles away, you just went the wrong direction.  There's a guy in Jersey, he's 24,999 miles away.  What an idiot. 
[01:46:00]  You're an idiot, Charlie.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm sorry.  Like I say, I don't, I don't know, maybe it's kilometers, 15,000 kilometers.  They're calling you Charlie the Showstopper from Bulgaria.  Will you do something, Charlie?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you mean?  Like, what else?  What do you want me to say?  You got, they got hot, this is probably the, Bulgaria's probably the best kept secret as  far as hot chicks are concerned.  Well, that's wonderful, but we haven't talked to a hot chick yet, now have we, Charlie?  Oh, yeah.  It's a shame, too, because she's pretty cute. 
[01:46:30]  Well, is there any other people around?  I tell you, there's no, I'm in this room and there's no, I wish, you know, like I say,  I wish I could.  Just strike her with the phone.  There's nobody here.  Yeah.  When was the last time you had sex, Charlie?  I'd say about two weeks ago.  Why two weeks?  Why two weeks?  Because I was in, back in the States.  What was his name? 
[01:47:00]  See, what?  Oh, come on, hey, come on, come on.  No, no, no.  All right, Charlie, we gotta let you go.  We're trying hard here, man.  We're breaking out all the tricks and nothing's working with you.  Yeah.  Absolutely nothing.  You're all the way in Bulgaria.  We were even gonna do an old gag.  We can't speak to Bulgarians.  Yeah, we can't do our old gag.  We can't do anything with you.  You're in Bulgaria.  You're outside.  There's people there.  And we can't speak to Bulgarians.  Yeah, well, like I said, it's just a phone booth that's in a...  Yeah, we get the phone booth concept. 
[01:47:30]  Everybody's at work.  Pull out your junk for that lady waiting for the phone.  Is that illegal?  Oh, God.  Probably not.  In Bulgaria, they probably, if you do that, you have to pay the family with a yak.  Some barbaric custom.  No, we don't really know much about Bulgaria.  No.  You show your genitals to a stranger, that's the equivalent of four raspberries.  What?  Well, you know, Bulgaria is pretty much, I guess you can imagine, communist Russia along Miami 
[01:48:00]  Beach.  That's it.  Well, just like Miami Beach, but it's communist, huh?  I know Hitler kind of liked it for a little while.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  All right.  Charlie.  So, anyway, well, I just wanted to check in with you guys.  I know you were hurting for faraway phone calls, and I just want to say I've been a  big fan, still am a fan.  So you felt like we were hurting for a faraway phone call, and you decided that your phone  call was just going to be the catch-me-out today. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, boy.  Everyone's going to be talking about Charlie from Bulgaria today, after we're off the air.  They're calling you Charlie is a Bulgarian douche.  Oh, jeez.  Well, I want to thank you, by the way.  I want to thank you for paying your taxes, by the way.  You're helping me have a...  Oh, good God.  There he goes.  Thank God.  All right.  Now, you know, it forced us to go to the Poconos.  I'm sorry, but we have to.  It's in the rules.  Keith, what's up? 
[01:49:00]  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Hey, help us out.  Charlie killed us right there.  All right.  I just called.  I wanted to give you a diabolical laugh.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  I just hope that all the killing I've been watching on TV isn't affecting me.  Okay.  Okay.  That's it.  I'm not very diabolical.  I detest diabolical laugh Tuesday. 
[01:49:30]  Do you?  It bothers me on a level I can't verbalize.  We might do wake up your roommate Tuesday.  I like that.  Start a fire in the place.  We're thinking about it.  So how about this?  Start a fire to get your roommate out of bed Tuesday.  All right.  That would be great.  But if you're going to wake up your roommate on a Tuesday, it's got to be with like, you  know, a fire extinguisher or something loud.  How about just screaming?  Yeah.  Like a marching band.  Something.  Something dumb.  Wake your roommate up with scalding water Tuesday. 
[01:50:00]  Can we do that?  We'll see what happens next Tuesday.  Suicide notes.  Where did we get these suicide notes from?  The staff?  Where are they?  Well, we got some suicide notes.  They were gathered at the coroner's offices by a suicidologist, psychiatrist.  Suicidologist.  Who asked to be anonymous.  He edited identifying details out of the compiled manuscript.  And we changed the names. 
[01:50:30]  But the text of each letter plus the age and sex given are real.  All these people did kill themselves.  We know this is real?  Yeah.  This was taken from a coroner.  Oh, my God.  Sam.  Oh, my God.  What is going on today?  We said all that already.  But how do we know this is real?  How do we know this is real, though?  Anyone can say that.  It was...  I had found it...  Man, where did I find it?  I can't remember where I found it.  It was a while ago.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:00]  Charlie.  There's so much that happens.  Charlie put everyone to sleep.  All right.  Why don't we...  All right.  Dan's saying take a break.  But we got actual suicide notes.  They're really creepy.  These are depressing.  Yeah, they're really bad.  Yeah, we're going to end the show in, I don't know, in a different way today.  We're going to read these suicide notes next.  Oh, no.  We're going to have laughs.  You think?  I know.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning. 
[01:51:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  On the instant feedback, we got David from Florida.  He writes, how about making it Wake Your Housemates Tuesday?  This way it'll include wives, husbands, kids, etc.  Bonus laughs for an inventive way to wake up everyone in the house at once.  With that, we got John in West Virginia.  We might be on to something.  This could either fail miserably or this could be good.  We'll have to take that chance.  John, what's going on, man?  Not much. 
[01:52:00]  What are you guys up to?  We took your phone call because it says you want to wake up your wife.  Yes, I'm sneaking in there now.  All right.  How are you going to wake her up?  I'm going to give her a little Jimmy noise.  Oh, okay.  Jimmy noise is going to wake up his wife.  Let's hear this.  Let's hear this.  Ow.  Would you do that to me and scare me? 
[01:52:30]  I'm sorry.  Wait, what'd you say?  Yeah.  He had the cutest little voice.  He says, what'd you do that to me for?  You scare me.  Oh, underdog.  I love that movie.  Did I get enough?  It was really funny.  Yeah.  She sounded like kind of mad but sweet. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Did she hit you with something?  She clawed me.  She what?  She clawed me with her nails.  Oh, she clawed you?  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  You're an ass.  All right.  Where's Travis?  Pick up your scorecards, everybody.  God, I can't believe we got added to the Tuesday.  Yes.  All right.  Tuesday is Rock Screen Tuesday, Diabolical Laugh Tuesday, which might be fading out soon.  We'll give it one more week.  Hummer Tuesday, Far Away Phone Call Tuesday, and Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday. 
[01:53:30]  That could include just roommates, spouses, kids, wives, daughters.  Whoever's in the house asleep.  There you go.  Yeah.  Right on.  Okay.  We got suicide notes here.  This is kind of creepy.  We were all reading these during the break, and I don't know.  This is creepy.  Yeah.  So some coroner gave these notes to some suicidologist slash psychiatrist, and now we get to all read 
[01:54:00]  them on the internet.  Yeah.  Kind of gives you a little insight.  Kind of gives you a little insight to some of these people's problems.  Wow.  The worst one is the last one.  The last one?  Yeah.  Married guy.  Married guy.  Well, why don't we start with single female, age 21, the first one.  This is an actual suicide note.  Dearest Andrew, it seems as if I've been spending all my life apologizing to you for things that 
[01:54:30]  happened, whether they were my fault or not.  I am enclosing your pin because I want you to think of what you took from me every time you see it.  I don't want you to think I would kill myself over you because you're not worth any emotion  at all.  It is what you cost me that hurts, and nothing can replace it. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  All right.  Now that's okay.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, sure.  I'd like to know how these people kill themselves after leaving these notes, by the way, but  I guess they don't give you that information.  How about the next one?  Divorced female, age 37. 
[01:55:30]  You did a good girl's voice.  Why don't you continue?  My boss, Kenneth J., seduced me and made me pregnant.  To no one and everyone.  Divorced female, age 37?  Or is that one not worth reading?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  You got to finish the Kenneth J. one.  You can go back to that.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  So, well, I just want to set up.  This is a single female, age 31.  31.  And E-Rock is supplying the suicide music, you crazy.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's actually in his iPod. 
[01:56:00]  My boss, Kenneth J., my boss, Kenneth J., seduced me and made me pregnant.  He refuses to help me.  I had not, I had not, I had not had intercourse in two years.  He says that I will have to suffer through it by myself.  Several people know about this.  My doctor, uh, uh, and Pete M., who works at, uh, Williams.  Pete and I never had a love affair, although Kenneth would like to drag Pete into it.  Also, Dr. Arnold W. knows about it. 
[01:56:30]  I've always been such a good girl.  Daddy dear.  As much as it hurts me, I cannot make it this Friday.  I may be in very serious trouble.  I have always been a very good person, but it looks like I really got in a mess, though  no real fault of my own.  I must have been born to suffer.  Love, Elizabeth. 
[01:57:00]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  All right.  These are actual suits.  Yes.  Awful.  Female, age 37.  Okay.  To no one and everyone.  Because of a growing conviction.  By the way, excuse me.  How funny would it be if it was my boss, Tom C.  Tom C. 
[01:57:30]  I can't take Greg Opie H.  Hope you don't mind.  I used one of your ties.  They have made fun of my fat breasts and my breath and my hair.  I did the best I could.  I'm going to be a Hulkamaniac in the sky now.  I should have been dead now, but the rope broke.  I went to eat a bullet. 
[01:58:00]  I went to eat a bullet.  I didn't shoot it.  I just put mayo on it and ate it.  I'm going to now attempt to starve myself to death.  This could take a while.  This could take decades.  But my intentions are pure.  All right, let's go.  To no one and everyone.  Because of a growing conviction that a hereditary insanity is manifesting itself beyond my control,  I am taking this way out. 
[01:58:30]  Before mere nuisance attacks and rages against others assume a more dangerous form.  Because I am agnostic and believe funeral fanfare to be nonsense,  I ask that it be forgotten.  Instead, knowing there to be a marked shortage of cadavers for the medical profession,  for which I have endless respect,  I hereby bequeath my body to be medics to medics for dissection.  Anita R. 
[01:59:00]  To my father, Vincent M., the sum of one dollar.  She gave him a dollar?  Oh, no!  She left one dollar.  You get one dollar.  One dollar.  Wow.  That's an insult.  That is.  Well, you never know.  It could be something personal.  She could have repaid him. 
[01:59:30]  It could have been some innocent bet they made years ago that she was paying up.  Yeah, just paying up a buck.  Said, all right, here's your dollar.  Well, maybe he just really never borrowed money.  Or she didn't borrow money and she did once.  Yeah, and it was a buck.  Yeah.  It was cheap.  Late.  Boy, these, uh, this guy here, married male, age 45.  Yeah.  Can we go with some new suicide music?  Yes.  What do you got?  Let's hear it.  Mm.  Why is this suicide music? 
[02:00:00]  Listen to it.  It's just awful.  Dear Claudia, you win.  I can take it no longer.  I know you have been waiting for this to happen.  I hope it makes you very happy.  See, this is not an easy thing to do, but I've got to the point where there's nothing to live for.  A little bit of kindness from you would have made everything so different, but all that ever interested you was the dollar. 
[02:00:30]  It's pretty hard for me to do anything when you are so greedy.  Even with the house, you couldn't even be fair with that.  Well, it's all yours now, and you won't have to see the lawyer anymore.  I wish you would give my personal things to Danny.  Especially my liquor.  He's such a drunk.  Right on the same page.  You couldn't get much from selling them anyway. 
[02:01:00]  You still have my insurance.  It isn't much, but it's enough to take care of my debts and still have a few bucks left.  You always told me that I was the one that made Sharon take her life.  In fact, you said I killed her.  But you know deep down in your heart, it was you that made her do what she did.  And now, you have two deaths to your credit.  It should make you very proud.  Goodbye, kid.  P.S. Disregard all the mean things I said in this letter. 
[02:01:30]  I said a lot of things to you I didn't really mean.  I hope you get well and wish all the best and everything.  Kathy, don't come in.  Call your mother, she'll know what to do.  Love, Daddy.  Kathy, don't go in the bedroom. 
[02:02:00]  I've been in Europe for a while.  How did he drown himself in the bedroom?  Well, he crashed through the window and ended up in a lake.  Ah, it was one front property, of course.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Makes sense in the end.  And a dolphin ate him.  Wow.  Yeah, those are kind of creepy, huh?  Those are suicide notes.  The creepiest thing is Kathy don't come in the bedroom. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  How could Kathy not take a peek?  Ah, you gotta take a peek at that point.  She just sees two, like, dark blue socks, one with a slipper on, and one with a slipper  off to the left.  Just slid off, feet going all wacky.  The muscles once again.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  Hey, we got a suicide note generator.  The internet is just filled with fun things to do.  You can just do that?  All right, it says, put your name in.  E-Rock.  All right, E-Rock.  E-Rock, suicide reason, inferiority, destiny, accident, religion, happy, unhappy, McDonald's, 
[02:03:00]  pat.  Inferiority.  How about D, all of the above?  Inferiority.  P.S. message, legacy, family, remains, afterlife, favor.  Favor.  Favor, you greedy.  All right, and here we go.  We write E-Rock suicide note.  All right.  That's it?  There it is.  All right.  Dear world, I wish everyone could know the pain I live with every day of my miserable  life.  Alas, no. 
[02:03:30]  Statistics tells me that only one in every 30,000 adult males has a penis less than four  inches long and two inches around.  What?  I don't know.  Only they, my we, we need brethren, can even begin to understand the hurt I feel when I  step up to a urinal and the scream of, uh, is only slightly smaller than the, uh.  I don't think that's serious.  I have tried.  Music.  I have tried pumps, creams, exercises, pulling, and God forbid, even praying. 
[02:04:00]  Nothing works.  Not even marginally on my minuscule member.  So every day I try to lie to the world about possessing a petite, uh, you know what?  By peeling out in my Corvette, strutting around in expensive suits, talking about my mansion,  dating strippers to show the world my virility, and constantly crowing about my colossal crotch.  But my Armani suits are just expensive costumes to hide my teeny tiny tallywhacker.  My gigantic house is where I sit alone with my dwarf Johnson. 
[02:04:30]  And the truth is, the only thing I can stretch when it comes to my freakishly feeble Frankfurter.  Day in and day out, I used to ask myself, E-Rock, what would Jesus do with a small, uh, after hours of reading the Bible, searching my soul, and peering at the puny, uh, I know now that there's no savior, at least not for my snack-sized sex stub.  Signed, E-Rock.  Please, uh, mail my cable bill.  It's on the credenza. 
[02:05:00]  That sucked.  That was awful.  I got, we all got real excited.  We wished, uh, it was a serious one.  It should have been a favor that E-Rock would really ask.  Like, please take my hair and donate it to a cancer patient who doesn't mind being humiliated.  Yeah, there, Jimmy saved us a little bit.  That stunk.  Horrid.  All right.  Well, I think it's a good place to leave the show, huh?  Yeah, I'm leaving shortly, so let me bid goodbye to the listeners.  Jimmy will be on Jimmy Kimmel tomorrow night. 
[02:05:30]  I'm writing a note.  Oh, no.  I'll do it on the air.  It's easier.  No.  Eh.  What would it say?  Eh.  Eh.  I probably would just go, look, I hate to do this, but the reason is, and then just let it trail off the page.  Oh, leave a little mystery.  No, I would just blame somebody who had nothing to do with it.  I'd make them feel all bad.  Thanks for nothing, Than.  Than was finally the straw that broke the camel's back.  Let this sit with you. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Jimmy, Jimmy Kimmel, what can I say?  Tomorrow night.  That's awesome.  Yes.  Are we going to see you before we all go to Detroit?  Are you coming back?  I might.  I might have a film audition.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I'm going to learn a casino business.  I realized I was thinking of two references at once, neither of which were funny.  Way to swing and miss.  So I think the next time we see Jimmy is going to be in Detroit for the ONA Traveling Virus  Comedy Show.  Tickets still available. 
[02:06:30]  Possibly.  Military ID gets you in free.  Yes.  All the info is up on VirusTour, one word on MySpace.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  All right, Jimmy.  Have fun in L.A.  Thank you, sweetie.  Um.  Um.  Wang.  Wang.  Wang.  Um.  Um.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:07:00]  Chalk Chalks Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And the show continues.  Hi.  Leslie in South Carolina.  We piss her off every day now.  Really?  I actually like reading her instant feedback.  She writes, uh, where the fuck is the XM show?  You guys better not play that long ecstasy of gold intro after all this time.  Go screw.  That's right.  It's no effing way.  If this long, long break is due to you guys doing promos for FM yet again, stop it. 
[02:07:30]  XM time.  9 to 11 a.m.  FM.  FM only gets you till 9.  Deal with it.  XM's in turmoil with this merger thing.  So, you know, we're not stupid.  We're taking advantage of the fact that, uh, no real work is being done right now at XM.  Exactly.  By the way, uh, are we on the XM website?  Where? 
[02:08:00]  How far buried are we these days?  It takes like four pages.  Four pages?  It takes four pages to get to us?  Is Reverend Al, uh, on the front page?  There he is, Reverend Al.  There he is.  Wow, times have a change.  Reverend Al is on the front page.  You can go to XMRadio.com and there he is, Reverend Al, coming to the power.  The latest.  XM 169.  The latest addition to the, uh, XM, uh, family.  Reverend Al.  Oh, B.  Great.  The times, they are a-changing. 
[02:08:30]  Uh, God.  All right, well, let's see.  Get some of that propaganda.  You got the, uh, you got the ACC stuff, right?  Or, uh, well, you got the, all right, they, they promote college sports in general.  What else are they promoting on the front page?  All right, you got a little jazz with, uh, Wynton Marsalis.  Marsalis.  You got, uh, some of that.  I love his, uh, chicken.  You got that Indy.  Oh, that's Marsala.  You got that IndyCar stuff.  What else?  Uh, live, uh. 
[02:09:00]  At the Knitting Factory.  Mm-hmm.  What else?  Oprah, of course.  The Big Get.  Uh, Oprah.  The Big Get, if you have XM.  Bob Dylan.  His radio show is excellent.  Bob Dylan.  Oh, there we are.  There we are.  Hello.  And there we go.  No, we're on the front page, sort of.  Yeah, there we go.  Goodbye.  Is that kind of, uh.  Yeah, but look.  Cycling through?  Reverend Al don't blink out, does he?  No, of course not.  He's there the whole time.  In his suit and tie. 
[02:09:30]  Why don't they put him in his sweatsuit?  I would have gotten one of the old pictures from the 80s with his big-ass Volkswagen hubcap medallion and his sweatsuit, his jogging suit and his greased back Don King hair and put that on the front page.  And you go, here's who's on XM now.  On the power!  Ah, man.  The power!  You know, a lot of people ask for our opinion on the whole Reverend Al coming to XM thing.  Yeah.  I was thinking the obvious.  Maybe, you know, with him being on satellite radio, he'll understand what satellite radio is all about. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And then he won't be so outraged about people just trying to do a dumb radio show that's supposed to be uncensored and is something you have to pay for.  Aren't they just simulcasting his radio show?  There's his old picture.  Jesus Christ.  He has a little Patrice O'Neill in him, doesn't he?  A little bit.  A little bit of Patrice.  Patrice grew out his hair?  Someone do that a little separate at birth. 
[02:10:30]  Old Reverend Al picture with Patrice O'Neill.  But Patrice is going to have to, like, grow out his hair.  Yeah.  All right.  So is it his regular radio show simulcast onto XM?  Or is it an exclusive, like, XM show?  I guess.  Because if he could curse, you know.  Oh, man.  And they get away with murder on that channel.  Oh, my God.  There's no problem because, you know.  I know.  They're yelling and screaming about Whitey.  No one's really paying attention.  The famous double standard that Patrice brought to everyone's attention.  Something tells me the power ain't really getting a lot of listeners. 
[02:11:00]  I'll tell you the truth.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't think the power is really getting a lot of people on board.  Angry white people.  Listen.  Right.  I think.  Because that's how it used to be with WLIB here in New York.  They were the same type of station.  It's a bunch of black people.  They get on the air.  They have interviews with other people, black militants, whatever.  And they just bad mouth the power that the powers that be, you know, the man, Whitey. 
[02:11:30]  And Whitey doesn't fight back.  Whitey just listens and gets angry.  I used to kick a radio off the roof every six months or so.  I'd be working on a rooftop unit or something.  And here's something that was being said on WLIB.  And just boot the radio right off the roof.  It was so angering.  It wasn't fun to listen to, though.  It was fun.  But sometimes in a strange way, no, one guy got on there and was talking about how the  melanin level in the skin isn't just in the skin. 
[02:12:00]  It's in all of the people's organs and that the melanin in the brain, there is a correlation  to that and intelligence.  OK, so the more melanin you have in your brain, the more intelligent you are, which he was  saying black people, more intelligent than white people, because they have melanin in  the brain.  So like Mickey, Mickey Rivers would be a genius.  Exactly.  It would have to be.  But that's what they were preaching on this station. 
[02:12:30]  I'm looking at the radio.  I go, what?  What the fuck are you saying?  Halle Berry, not so smart, but smart.  Yeah.  Smart, but not as smart as Mickey Rivers.  Right.  Mickey Rivers, you know, is like Einstein.  Michael Jordan.  Michael Jordan.  Pretty smart.  Kind of smart, right?  Pretty smart.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Our own Sam.  Barely smart.  Black Earl, a genius.  Black Earl, a genius.  Yeah.  Sure.  Manute Bull.  Oh, wow.  Rocket scientist.  Yeah, please.  Rocket scientist.  Get him to NASA. 
[02:13:00]  He's needed immediately.  But that was the kind of stuff.  And that's a single example of a thousand things that were said that used to just flame my ass  when I would listen to it.  Yeah.  But, you know, being a white guy, you really don't do anything.  You just kind of get mad.  But if a white show says something, then you're in big trouble.  Yeah.  Well, it's the whole double standard.  Yeah.  We know it's in place.  There's nothing that can be done about it. 
[02:13:30]  So we deal with it.  All right.  Like E-Rock.  He does no melanin.  So his brain really stinks.  He can't ever tell that his picture is so pixelated on Pal Talk that it's barely viewable.  Every day.  But what's...  His mind is crystal clear.  But does that matter?  Yeah, because then people that are watching see it and they see people like Lego people.  It's like, why is Opie and Anthony doing a show with Lego people? 
[02:14:00]  They don't have any smooth edges.  They're all jaggedy.  But that could be fun, doing a show with Lego people.  If they were real Lego people, these are people that are being made Lego by E-Rock's poor camera skills.  All right.  He opens his eyes real wide.  Watch what I do.  I don't know what we got ourselves into, but we're doing the hottest rod contest today.  Why isn't Jimmy here for this?  Was Anthony and I asleep during this meeting?  Asleep at the switch.  Why the fuck would we do a hottest rod contest? 
[02:14:30]  What was this suggested?  Was it Steve C's idea?  This is great.  It's the hottest rod contest.  We're doing a hottest rod contest.  Well, now don't get confused.  We won't be judging the most attractive of cock.  I know a lot of people out there are going, ooh, the hottest rod.  That must be, they pull out rods and judge them on shape, texture, and taste. 
[02:15:00]  But no.  I was going to go with taste, though.  But no.  Come on.  Well, it's...  We're really doing the hottest rod contest?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  People saying, sorry, still gay.  It's extremely gay.  I thought funny.  Sponsored by Paramount Pictures' new movie, Hot Rod.  Oh!  Starring Andy Samberg, who's coming in studio.  All right.  If there's a film tie-in...  Steve, I couldn't miss this. 
[02:15:30]  I wouldn't miss it for the world.  What is it?  The hot cock content?  No, Rod.  It's a movie.  And it stars Andy Samberg and Isla Fisher, Steve.  Isla Fisher.  I heard the promo a million times.  And Isla Fisher.  Oof.  That's just silent in her name.  She's married to that Borat guy.  Oh, yeah?  Isla Fisher.  Open nationwide Friday, August 3rd.  Right.  We got three contestants. 
[02:16:00]  We got $500 cash for the hottest rod.  Ooh, tell me more, Steve.  Wow.  Tell me more.  So we're giving away cash for boners?  Nice.  Can't we just change the contest?  Like, the first guy that gets wood just fucking takes the $500 and goes home?  Ew.  Wouldn't that make it more gay?  Even more gay.  Yeah, that's more gay.  Well, if you're going to be gay, it doesn't matter.  Kind of.  Think about it.  Yeah, how did this come about, Steve?  It was suggested by the wonderful people at XM, the sales department at XM. 
[02:16:30]  They had the hot rod people wanted to get involved.  Who's the fag working among us that suggested this?  Oh, you see him every Thursday.  Are you saying Will's a fag?  I didn't say Will's a fag.  You just said it.  Wow.  I said you see him every Thursday.  You just said that Will is a fag.  What?  He's a family man.  He's a family man.  Beard.  What he likes to do in his spare time is totally his choice.  All right, Steve.  Why don't you tell everyone what the contest is all about? 
[02:17:00]  A bunch of guys are going to grease up their cocks with Icy Hot.  He makes it sound sexy.  Yeah, doesn't he?  What?  Are you kidding?  What part?  What do you mean what part?  What part of the everything?  Just the whole junk.  Everything.  The most sensitive part, I would assume.  The, uh...  Your carriage.  The ball bag.  Okay, so balls.  I don't think balls are the most sensitive area. 
[02:17:30]  Isn't that what we did with these guys and those PSPs that one time?  If you really won a contest.  Oh, Christ.  Put it right on the knob.  So some goes in the hole.  You let someone...  Oh, shit.  You let someone stroke their knob with that fucking Icy Hot.  What the fuck is wrong with us?  Eesh.  What?  All right, then what happens?  It says, play the promo, it's totally gay, Steve C.  All right, let's hear the promo for the Hot Rod Contest.  Is this the promo where it says Isla Fisher?  Yeah, it is.  And there were three other people in the room with me when I cut that, and nobody corrected 
[02:18:00]  me.  Oh.  They were too busy sucking each other's cocks.  Well, so what?  You know what?  Shut up.  Let me finish this.  I'll join in.  You know, words hurt.  We got redneck from Atlanta.  Fez is straight compared to you fags.  Yeah.  Yep.  We can't even argue that point.  Is this it right here?  I believe it is.  Yeah.  All right.  We got the Hot Rod Contest promo from Steve.  All righty.  Let's wait to hear it.  I should listen to this channel when we're off the air, huh? 
[02:18:30]  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, it's the Hottest Rod Contest.  Brought to you by the movie Hot Rod, starring Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live and Isla  Fisher from Wedding Crouchers.  Isla.  Isla.  Isla.  Isla.  Oops.  I laugh hard because I know you take that stuff seriously.  I do.  See, I don't.  I mispronounce all the time.  But to you, it's a very serious thing when you mispronounce.  It is.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, it's the Hottest Rod Contest.  Brought to you by the movie Hot Rod, starring Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live and Isla 
[02:19:00]  Fisher from Wedding Crouchers in theaters August 3rd.  What is the hottest rod contest?  That's obvious.  Wait, I'm in the promo?  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Had to sex it up a little bit with two men.  To make sexy.  Theaters August 3rd.  What is the hottest rod contest?  That's obvious.  Let the conversation begin.  Wow.  That's a big dick.  Oh, my God.  I didn't hear this.  All right.  Who the fuck? 
[02:19:30]  Come on, guys.  What the fuck?  I didn't know I was the star of this fucking thing.  Good boy, Derek.  What happened?  Did you change the promo?  Wait.  No, that was...  You changed the promo because I heard a very boring...  Isn't that me talking about the cock?  Yes.  Yeah.  But I'm showing the cock.  That's bad, too.  This is the one that Derek initially made and sales went, no, it's too long. 
[02:20:00]  It's got to be 30 seconds.  So we cut out all the gay.  And this is the one that...  Oh, cut out all the gay.  So this really hasn't aired on the channel.  Well, it is now.  I knew I didn't hear this.  I knew I didn't hear this.  Oh, wait.  I got to get the part where I fucking present my cock, Anthony.  This is just wonderful.  Present.  Let me present.  Just present.  Hot Rod, starring Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live and Isla Fisher from Wedding Crashers  in theaters August 3rd.  What is the hottest Rod contest? 
[02:20:30]  That's obvious.  Let the conversation begin.  Wow.  That's a big dick.  Well...  What the fuck?  You guys suck.  That is a bad one.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Terry in San Antonio.  A fine observation coming in from San Antonio.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, no much to Santa Traffic. 
[02:21:00]  I had a little observation.  You got a hot fucking foreign chick in there with these great tits that nobody can look at,  but yet we can look at cocks doing whatever the hell you're going to do.  How gay is that?  This is so gay.  We talk about double standards on our show all the time, and it's not just a black-white  double standard thing.  It's also a chick-guy double standard thing.  Yeah, what the fuck?  They will let us do the gayest shit, and no one will even raise an eyebrow down the hall 
[02:21:30]  or down in Washington.  But as soon as you suggest that a girl comes in and maybe flashes us, all hell breaks loose.  Oh, we can't do that.  You're right, Terry.  Another double standard.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kerry in Vegas.  Kerry, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Is it me or when Steve was describing where they're going to put the icy hat, he was giggling  like a schoolgirl?  Was he?  Ball bag. 
[02:22:00]  I did not.  Yeah, frunk is all right.  Well, let me present my cock again.  The Hot Rod, starring Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live and Isla Fisher from Wedding Crashers  in theaters August 3rd.  What is the hottest rod contest?  That's obvious.  Let the conversation begin.  Wow.  That's a big dick.  Well, you come into the studio, paint up your cock with Icy Hot, and the last person  standing after a hefty amount of phallic physicality wins $500. 
[02:22:30]  Losers go home with a burning dick and some shit we had lying around the office.  Want to compete?  Email travis at foundrymusic.com.  That's travis at foundrymusic.com.  It's the hottest rod contest, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Brought to you by the movie Hot Rod in theaters August 3rd.  Wasn't there a different way we could have tied in the movie Hot Rod?  Yes.  Than for Rod to be the cock?  Yes.  Because Hot Rod is...  We're talking about... 
[02:23:00]  Well, we could have just got a bunch of rods.  Guys named Rod.  Rod.  That's your name, Rod.  That's what's gay.  All right, let's try to figure out which rod is the hottest.  Hot Rod.  Yeah, this is...  We'll have a swimsuit competition.  Guys are going to be, like, stroking their dicks?  What the fuck?  Look, man, you were there.  Nah, I don't remember this.  You were there.  Wasn't I?  You had this meeting, yes.  Really? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, man.  All right, Steve.  So, they come in.  They show their goodness.  Then what?  Show their deliciousness.  And we have tubes of brand new Icy Hot for them to apply liberally to their nether region  and however they see fit.  Just balls or we go in shaft?  Start with balls.  Start with balls, go shaft.  We kind of did this contest already.  Shut up.  And it took forever.  Well, we have a couple showstoppers. 
[02:24:00]  I don't really want to do, you know...  Let me see the showstopper.  Anal beads.  That's right.  And this is apparently nasty.  So...  Gold bond...  Why is that one nasty?  The blue is supposed to be nasty.  I never seen green.  I thought this was the blue.  No, blue comes in a blue fucking thing.  This is a green thing.  I guess I wasn't supposed to say it.  Triple action.  Oh, I know.  Pulled it out of the bag.  I saw it.  Silly me. 
[02:24:30]  How do you open this fucking thing?  Uh-oh.  Don't.  Here he goes.  What are you doing?  Are you...  Oh, my God.  All right.  Ope just...  I'll let you...  Ope's trying to be the hot rod.  He just put a little gold bond down his pants.  Anything?  Nothing.  Is it tingly...  Is that menthol or something?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Because it's green?  Nothing.  Extra strength.  Medicated?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Ope.  Did it hit something or...  Nothing.  Uh-huh. 
[02:25:00]  A little...  A little...  A tingle.  Okay.  How's it doing?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Turn on the air conditioning.  If I start sweating, this could be really bad.  Is it...  Oh, boy.  A little tingle.  Tingle.  What did you get it on?  Everything.  Everything?  Yeah.  That could be a problem.  Try some.  No.  Give it to him.  No.  No.  I got things to do.  Try some.  Try some. 
[02:25:30]  I can't do that.  Try some.  No, it's...  I think the key is not to rub it in.  It's cooling.  So far, so good.  So...  Oh, boy.  No, see, it doesn't sound good what you're doing.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  No.  I'll put some on my wrist.  On your wrist.  That's not that sensitive.  All right.  Put it on your wrist.  No.  No.  Just a little.  Put a little on my wrist. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, boy.  And I'll rub it in.  Okay.  Uh...  Very tender area.  Uh-oh.  Da-da.  Da-dee.  Uh...  Um...  Yeah.  It's...  It's, uh...  It's getting hot here.  It's getting a little hot.  Are you getting a little warm?  Just a little bit.  That's nice.  Um...  Okay.  All right.  How do we get this off?  Uh...  Cold water.  Oh, boy.  Is it cold water? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Use cold water and, uh, rinse it off.  Oh, fuck.  Oh.  It got under your bag?  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll be where it is.  It'll be where it is.  Yeah.  Oh, it tingles a little bit.  Yeah, it's...  Oh, okay.  Don't sit down.  Oh.  Get Steve to blow on it.  No, that'll do.  Oh, man.  Oh, oh.  That would be gay.  Yeah, this is, uh...  Pretty tingly.  Pretty... 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  Woo!  You gotta rinse it.  What's it doing?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  What's it doing?  It's just...  It's...  It's getting hotter.  Hotter?  And hotter.  Underneath your, uh, ball bag?  Look, he's walking like, uh, John Wayne.  He's all bow-legged.  Oh.  All right.  Rinse it off.  No, I'm not rinsing it off.  Why?  I'm not stupid.  Shit.  That's fucking funny. 
[02:27:30]  Put cold water on that.  Oh, my God!  Might as well be acid.  What?  Was it making you piss?  Dude, I...  Or did your ball spring a leak?  I swear to God, just to be funny, I wish I could show you this, but then, you know, that  would be gay.  But it's hilarious.  It's completely, like, uh, white.  Well, it's powder, so...  No, I know.  Does it look like your cock was snorting coke?  Oh, fuck.  Fuck. 
[02:28:00]  What the hell was that?  I had to drop the thing.  Oh.  I thought it was his rod.  Banging it against the sink.  I gotta attempt to brush it off carefully.  That...  That won't work.  You know what?  Hold it under the faucet with real cold water.  Ow!  All right.  What is that stuff made for?  If it hurts wherever you put it.  Apparently not washing your dick off in the sink.  Put it on your... 
[02:28:30]  It's not for hemorrhoids, either.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Don't fucking try to rub it off!  His balls hurt.  Use is temporarily relieves the pain and itch associated with minor cuts,  sunburn, insect bites, scrapes, prickly heat.  Prickly heat.  Fucking 1800s thing is that.  Ah!  It's in my...  It's in your what?  Pee hole.  Oh, you got it in your piss hole?  Has to be the most sensitive area on a guy's body is the piss hole. 
[02:29:00]  Problem?  Ah.  It's making me want to urinate.  Hmm.  Jeez.  His dick has the prickly heat. 
[02:29:30]  It does say for external use only.  Yeah.  And to avoid contact with eyes.  Well, thank God he didn't throw it in his eyes.  Well, that would be nice.  Jesus, are you okay?  What the hell are you doing in there?  It just makes me want to urinate over and over again.  Are you pissing it out of your hole?  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! 
[02:30:00]  All right.  That's not...  You know what?  It's not going to be the showstopper, but it's not fun.  Well, the other stuff will do a lot of damage.  All right.  Bring in the guys.  Oh, great.  That's another great sound clip.  All right.  Bring in the guys.  Well, here we go.  Can't you just say contestants?  We got Will on the line, the sales guy that came up with this.  Will!  Yes, sir.  How's it going?  Hey, faggot.  So far, this bit's a home run.  Home run. 
[02:30:30]  Exactly.  Ope, how's the people?  It stinks.  Does that get 500 bucks?  So you are very excited that we did this contest, huh?  I'm chubbing, Ope.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right.  We got our guys in the studio here.  Thank goodness.  Anything else, Will?  Not too much.  You know, I think these ideas for contests are brilliant.  What's wrong with this?  Ten quality minutes and you're in pain.  Holy shit.  How the fuck do you get this shit off? 
[02:31:00]  You are really fucked.  He keeps shaking his pants like it's going to shake it off of your ball sack.  Now you're sitting down and it hurts more.  It feels icy and hot at the same time, even though it's not icy hot.  All right, Will.  We got to get your gay contest out of the way.  So balls of fury, the ping pong movie coming up in two months.  We'll talk then.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, sure.  No more gay bets.  Who do we got in studio here?  I know that dude. 
[02:31:30]  That's Matt.  What's going on?  He won Super Bowl.  Don't mind me.  Why are you yawning?  I don't know.  I was reading their name tags.  Matt, Dan, and Rob.  Hi.  Those are our three contestants.  Our three rods.  Oh, God.  We got...  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened to this show?  All right, Steve.  Why don't you apply the icy hot?  Oh, yeah.  It's not part of the contest.  Steve, put it on your tongue and start applying. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, blah, blah, blah.  I can certainly distribute.  So how's this going to work, Steve?  You got to make sure they're putting shit on their hot rods.  Why do I have to be the one?  Because you're the one that did the fucking promo.  He thought it was hilarious.  Remember?  I laughed a little bit.  Yeah, sure.  We're going to give each guy his own little personal container so they don't have to spread germs.  Get the AIDS.  Exactly.  There you go.  And they're going to... 
[02:32:30]  How did you guys do it when you did your contestant, Dan, your contestant for the PSP?  Did you apply a huge pile at first?  Yes, it was a big handful.  You got to squirt it in your hand.  And then you got to take it and pull the front of your pants out and then grab your sack with the hand with all the shit in it and then just maul it around.  Just goof it around.  It's all over your ball bag.  It's in the rules.  Someone has to make sure they're doing this.  Yes, somebody has to look and make sure they're getting the area because all they could do is put their hand and turn it and get it on the pants and they don't have anything. 
[02:33:00]  So, Steve, you have to look.  And make sure, because it's a hot rod, they got to at least get a little on the rod.  All right, Steve.  Make sure they do it.  Yeah.  Okay, fine.  Oh, their pants are down.  Jesus, what the fuck has happened?  Hey, wait.  What has happened?  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Mark in upstate New York.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[02:33:30]  You're the dynamite guy?  I was...  What?  What's this?  You're the dynamite guy?  Correct.  Well, I own a job site, a construction site.  Right now, I have a dynamite guy loading about 1,500 pounds of sticks in the ground that at 10.15 we're going to blow off.  And at the moment, we are live on Paltalk on the wood floor camera.  And at 10.15, we're going to set off 1,500 pounds of dynamite for anyone who might want to look and listen. 
[02:34:00]  All right, now your shot is...  Okay, what am I looking at here?  Looks like a tank.  Right now, you probably see an Arctic truck, an articulating truck full of trees just going up the road.  All right, and what are you blowing up today?  Just the ground for what reason?  Correct.  We're installing water mains, and we have a lot of shell that we have to get through.  So, he's drilled probably 12-foot holes, you know, 12-foot down, and we have no real overburden over it. 
[02:34:30]  So, it's all rock right up to the top of the ground.  So, we should see a lot of stones flying.  It's not going to be a real pretty one.  A lot of stuff's going to go in the air.  All right, very cool.  So, in about what, a half hour?  Correct.  We've got to set for about 10.15.  All right, 10.15, call us back, all right?  Yeah, give us a call there when...  I will do that.  Get the word out to all our PalTalk friends. 
[02:35:00]  Dynamite exploding on PalTalk today in a half hour from right now.  That'd be cool.  All right, so we've got Matt, we've got Dan, and what's your name, bro?  Rob.  And Rob.  Okay, Steve's over there.  Now, these guys are going to apply Icy Hot, and then what happens, Steve?  And then, well, that's just the first round.  They actually have to get the Icy Hot to the area, and then we have a barrage of tests we can put them through.  So, yes, they will have to do some type of exercises and movements that will only irritate.  And they can tap out whenever they want. 
[02:35:30]  Last Man Standing gets $500, and Hot Rod gets a great promotion for their movie.  And we wind up looking gay.  Yeah, and we've got Andy Samberg coming in to talk about the movie.  That would have been fine enough.  That would have got the word out.  Yeah, of course.  The word out, but we had to do this.  All right, Steve, go ahead.  Why don't you guys apply?  Kenny, you're going to be a witness, too?  Oh, God.  He just drops them out of the bottom of his underwear.  I was checking to make sure they have an equal amount of Icy Hot they're applying to the area.  All right, they do seem to really be digging in. 
[02:36:00]  What's wrong, Steve?  Well, Matt's good.  I didn't really expect to get the shot.  The visual I got.  I'm here to win.  He's really lathering.  Jesus.  I'm here to win.  Yeah, Matt's not a shy guy.  Icing two plums.  Matt won the Super Bowl competition.  Yes, he did.  The famous Super Bowl competition with the yellow jackets and the wasps and all that.  How's that guy, Kenny?  That were stinging his ball bag.  Oh, this doesn't take long, huh?  Wow.  Oh, you're feeling it already?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Wait, who's feeling it?  Dan?  Yeah.  All right, a little more.  All right, Kenny is applying more because he's a sick F.  Kenny's just dumping it right down the front of their pants.  Oh, my God.  Hey, by the way, it's hot rod, so you should get the rod hot.  That's what Kenny just did.  This isn't hot balls.  This is hot rod.  Does it matter?  I don't know.  I'm just hoping that this ends really quickly.  Yeah, it burns.  All right, it burns?  Yeah, yeah, it burns.  It stings. 
[02:37:00]  All right, anyone having a problem yet?  It's hot.  You gotta pee a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, is that what it makes you do?  But you're hanging in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  How about some squats?  I think they should put some on their anus for good measure.  Jesus, Kenny.  Kenny.  You know, if you ask me.  Just a little, you know. 
[02:37:30]  Dabble-dewey on the anus.  Did they get it on their rods, Kenny?  Everyone has it on their anus?  Huh?  I personally saw that.  They're okay.  No drying off.  I'm not drying off.  I'm looking to make sure.  Oh, you tell them, Steve.  Steve's used to saying that.  No drying off.  Keep it nice and wet.  How would he dry it off?  What?  It immediately feels like a bad idea.  Are you going to last?  Oh, he just shook his head.  No way.  They need a few squats. 
[02:38:00]  Something to get the, get it really working.  Because the more they stand still, the more they can kind of get used to it.  How do you want me to squat?  How about they run in place?  Yeah, like that.  Like that.  Just squat up, down, up, down.  There you go.  Down, up.  Do that like ten times.  Dude, they got to run in place because then the bag starts rubbing against everything.  Yeah.  Five.  Wow.  Six.  See, now the bag is rubbing against their thighs.  That's got to hurt.  Yeah.  Eight.  Two more.  Mm-hmm.  Ten.  And ten. 
[02:38:30]  There you go.  Yeah.  How's that?  Kenny, do you want them running in place, Kenny?  Nobody liked the anus idea?  Slow down.  We're trying to make believe you never said that.  How's that feeling?  It's warm.  Yeah, it's still very, very hot.  Yeah.  Very hot.  Wow.  All right, how about you run in place?  Unfortunately, I think they need to lose their shoes and pants.  You're going to have to lose their shoes and shoes.  Yeah.  Why do they have to lose their pants?  Well, because they're...  What the fuck's wrong with your guys?  They can't really exercise well with pants around their ankles.  Oh, that's all right. 
[02:39:00]  They keep their underpants on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny, what do you want them to do?  Run in place?  We're losing Rob any second.  Nobody commented what nice briefs they're wearing.  Because we're not gay.  Why don't you describe it for the audience there, Kenny?  Why don't you go right down the line?  All three of them got a nice shade of blue on.  Rob's got, like, the boxer briefs.  Dan.  Rob's got big thighs.  What's up, Rob?  You're an athlete?  What do you do?  Wrestle?  Wrestle and rugby also. 
[02:39:30]  And rugby, yeah.  I bet this kid's got a nice anus.  Let me see your anus.  Thanks, Hope.  I see the, you know...  Complimenting a man's legs.  I see the thighs.  I can tell that he does a lot of running or something, or I was going to guess biking  or soccer, but he said rugby.  You're just telling the guy he's got nice legs.  I didn't say nice legs.  I said they were built up or whatever.  He's pretty.  It's okay.  All right.  What about Dan?  Does he have nice legs, Ant?  I don't know.  I can't look at another man and say whether something's nice. 
[02:40:00]  Come on, Anthony.  What a guy would like or anything.  Come on.  Just give the guy a compliment.  Give him a compliment.  No.  No.  Not your type.  Unless there's a vagina at the top of them.  All right.  You want them running in place there, Kenny?  Yeah.  And just to guess, I would say Matt's got the biggest hog.  You guys want to have a big...  Thank you, Kenny.  Just to guess.  You guys want to have a biggest hog contest?  That's all right.  That's gay.  That's gay.  All right.  How about...  Someone's suggesting that somebody blow on the Icy Hot. 
[02:40:30]  Kenny?  Would you do the honor?  Oh, God.  You could close your eyes.  How about we get Kenny a blindfold?  Because, you know, we know if you blow on the Icy Hot...  I've got a plane to catch.  Goodbye.  It actually makes it burn more.  Come on.  Who's going to do that?  Steve, I guess?  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Kenny, you'll do it, right?  No.  Kenny.  Hey.  Come on.  It's for the show.  I know.  All right.  Get Steve.  Steve has to do it, then.  Steve.  Or E-Rock. 
[02:41:00]  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  We got an idea.  Will you help us out?  E-Rock, we need your help to make this work better.  Yeah.  Come over here.  We need your help.  E-Rock, you're up for almost anything, right?  Put the blindfold on, and we want you to blow on their cocks to get the eye.  It's got to get, because the air, because the air, the moving air makes it sting more.  Do you have any money from your winnings?  Ah, yeah.  Of course not.  How about Steve?  Someone's got to, come on, Kenny.  How about, we start? 
[02:41:30]  Someone blow the three guys.  Here comes the hero.  All right.  Jared.  Jared.  Jared will do everything.  Jared.  All right, Jared.  Flex the penises.  All right, we don't need a blindfold.  You just close your eyes.  Kenny, you open up their eyes.  Look up at them.  Kenny, you.  Look up.  Give them the fish eyes when you do it.  Let's get a mic on, Jared.  Jared.  Kenny, you'll open up their drawers, and then Jared blows, and you make sure he does it right. 
[02:42:00]  All right, get over there, Jared.  Get a full lungful.  A full.  Get lungfuls, and just go.  Nice, big.  Down their pants.  No contact.  No, you don't got to touch their dicks, you nuts.  No contact.  Let's go.  Why can't they put it on themselves?  It's on.  No, it's on.  All you have to do is blow on it.  Look, look.  Here's the deal.  Jesus Christ.  The shit is on their dick already.  We just want to, like, keep it up on it.  You just got to blow on it, because.  That activates it more.  That's right.  All right, let's get Jared up to our first guy, Rob, with the nice legs. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  Hold on.  Hold on, Jared.  Problem.  Jared.  Jared.  Jared.  Jared.  By the way, one other thing.  We need you to wear the Hot Rod Smack Destiny in the face.  Yes.  Underpants.  That's, uh, it's a must.  Because you're part of Team Rod.  All right, put these on.  Team Rod.  You're part of Team Rod.  Let's go.  Hurry up.  All right, hurry up.  Get those on. 
[02:43:00]  Hurry up.  Come on, time's a-wasting.  Time's a-wasting.  That's right.  We got dynamite that's going to explode in about 20 minutes.  You're not supposed to think when we ask you something.  Just jump.  I mean, you know, a lot of people are pointing out the obvious.  Bill from Waterford.  Eastside Dave would blow them.  Oh, hell yeah.  Don't let Eastside Dave win the radio wars.  Literally.  Literally.  He was saying he'd eat and jizz him.  What?  What's going on?  What's him doing on a round?  Oh.  Yeah, another round.  Get a little more in there.  You guys are getting a little too young.  All right.  Kenny is, uh...  Kenny, load up their hands. 
[02:43:30]  Kenny's giving them each a dollop.  A dollop of icy hot.  Oh, God.  Jared is putting on the, uh...  The hot rod underpants.  This is just disgusting.  What happened?  All right.  Hey, ask, uh...  Ask Jared what's taking him so long with his underpants.  He's trying to fit that fucking potato body into it.  Here comes Jared.  Rob's doubled over.  I know.  Rob, hang in there.  I'm good.  All right.  All right.  Here comes Jared. 
[02:44:00]  In the hot rod.  All right.  This is the gayest shit ever.  Holy fuck.  Get him on PalTalk.  They'll appreciate this.  Get in front of the, uh...  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  It's not the first time you guys have seen me naked.  No, but it's the hot rod underpants.  You're like...  Look at that shot.  Oh, God.  He is shaped like a bowl of mashed potatoes.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hey, someone's in the way.  You know, they're trying to look at this on PalTalk. 
[02:44:30]  You got the big hot rod logo on the back of the underpants.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Uh...  All right.  Uh, Kenny.  Jared, all you have to do is get a nice big breath of hot air and blow them.  Yeah, just...  Just blow on them.  Just blow down...  Just blow down a birthday cake.  Blow down the top of their pants.  That's right.  They're going to pull it out.  Let's go.  Pull the top of their pants out.  Come on.  Let's go.  And you just go...  Come on, Jared.  Just blow down on...  Get on your knees.  Oh, God.  What happened?  This is disgusting. 
[02:45:00]  You're not going to do anything, right?  No.  No.  Don't do anything.  Don't do anything.  No.  No one be a jokester.  This isn't gay enough.  Just let him do that.  I know.  All right.  Let's go.  This guy is completely out of hand gay.  No.  Don't even fucking touch my hand.  I'll break it.  He's going to break it.  Just blow on his cock.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  All right, Rob.  Pull the underpants out a little bit.  This is so bad. 
[02:45:30]  Remember, this is for $500.  Now blow down the top of his pants.  Come on.  Let's go, Jared.  Oh, you didn't even...  All right, listen.  Get a mic on, Jared, first of all.  And you didn't pull out the top of your elastic far enough.  Yeah, pull it out far enough.  And Jared, you got to go down.  You're not blowing...  You got to blow down the top of his pants.  And the contestants are worried.  We're not going to get your cock on film.  No one wants to see your cock.  Don't fucking worry about it.  This is disgusting. 
[02:46:00]  All right, let's go.  All right, Jared is in front of Rob.  But you got to get up there.  Get up there.  You can bend down if you...  It's got to be a long...  I'm not the best in shape.  It's got to heat up.  How funny would it be if he passed out as he's wearing the hot rod underpants?  Falls into his cock.  All right, let's go.  Come on, Jared.  What are you waiting for?  Come on.  Here you go.  Now pull out.  Oh, God.  You spit all over.  Do it with love. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, what's wrong with you, Jared?  I don't want to do this.  It's a slow blow.  Slow blow.  A slow blow.  You're starting to make me think that you're gay.  What's the matter with you?  What is this?  Oh, wow.  Look, here's the $500.  Wow.  All right.  From American Express, do we have to plug them, too?  All right.  Why not?  All right, come on.  Let's go, Jared.  Come on.  Slow blow down the top.  Make sure you hit... 
[02:47:00]  Demonstrate the blow into the microphone.  That's all.  Yeah.  There you go.  That should heat up the board.  Let's do that.  Let's go.  Rob's first.  Come on, Jared.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  Fucking fag.  All right.  Move on.  Move on to Dan.  All right.  A lot of people are suggesting that you're a cock tease, Jared. 
[02:47:30]  I've been told that before.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Big, long, deep breath right down the top.  And no spittle.  Not straight.  You're straight on.  You got to go down the top.  Yeah.  Get closer.  There it is.  All right.  Let's go.  Anything, Dan?  No.  No.  This guy's nothing.  See?  This guy's nothing.  See?  Good.  All right.  Now we got Matt.  It's hot enough.  Ew.  Here goes, Jared.  One last time.  Oh, my God.  A little spit, Dan. 
[02:48:00]  Ah, he spit on him.  That was some spittle.  A little slobber.  All right.  Wow, that's.  Look at him running back to the bathroom.  Hey, where are you going?  Where are you going?  You got to cheer him on.  Yeah, get out of here.  You're the hot rod cheerleader.  Yeah, you stay there.  Hey, you stay there.  Someone's saying, what, this looks gay.  And someone goes, looks gay.  It is gay.  What's wrong, Jared? 
[02:48:30]  Nothing.  Why are you slouched over?  Be proud.  You're wearing the hot rod underpants.  Yep.  Wear it with pride.  Yeah.  That's the hot rod uniform.  Right.  You got the hot rod uniform on.  Have some pride.  Okay.  All right.  Now what, Kenny?  Kenny's over there with the contestants.  Well, we'll let him run in place, but I really, I hate to be a party pooper, but I got a plane  to catch him.  Oh, you are pooping the party.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I know. 
[02:49:00]  I like to stay for the big payoff, but I got to go.  The money shot?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  I remember an exercise that hurt a great deal last time.  Yeah, Dan did this with E-Rock, and who else did this?  Oh, right.  Danny.  Danny?  And Travis for at least 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Is get on your back and bicycle your legs like you're pedaling a bicycle.  Oh, remember that?  You want Jared to demonstrate?  Yes, please, Jared.  All right, Jared, demonstrate the exercise that the contestants have. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, Jared, get down on the floor there.  All right, here's Jared.  And demonstrate the exercise.  All right, go ahead, Jared.  You don't have to work the abs, but that's fine, too, if you want to throw that in.  Yeah, he's working the abs.  He's kind of going, oh, God.  He looks like a big abandoned baby.  Oh, shit.  This is just not right at all. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, very good.  Aren't you going to do it all day?  All day long.  Apparently, he will.  Yeah, he will.  All right, guys.  There you go.  Jared, get back on the couch.  Maybe should we do a quick fresh reapplication?  Sure.  Just to make sure it's...  What type of suicide note do you think Jared's going to leave?  Yeah, no problem.  You running out?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  You're running out of ice.  Running out?  They have a whole tube of ice on him?  I think Kenny used the same tube to reapply to all three guys, so we've got to crack on another one. 
[02:50:30]  All right, here we go.  They're applying more.  Icy hot.  God damn, this is just the worst freak.  Look at what Maury's got on.  Hot teens.  Help my 15-year-old prostitute.  Her sex-addicted 15-year-old already miscarried one baby, and she wants to have another baby.  That's what Maury has.  Look, we've got 15-year-old whores on our show.  Let me listen to O&A. 
[02:51:00]  What are they doing?  Oh, three guys rubbing their ball sacks, and a chubby guy in underoos blowing them.  Should we take a break before the dynamite explosion on Pal Talk?  Oh, right.  This is the show to listen to this week, I'll tell you.  God fucking...  Guys with the icy hot on their nutsack, and then men blowing stuff up.  Let's go to Josh in Jersey. 
[02:51:30]  Josh.  Hey, guys.  O.P. Anthony, get out of the studio.  I'm sending a guy with a dynamite gun to blow up the studio for your crack-gay staff.  Yeah, what the fuck, man?  Look, man, I don't know what happened.  Like, we suggest a stripper bid, and they say, no, they freak out.  But, you know, guys rubbing shit on their balls, no problem.  Yeah, it's no problem.  Everyone's happy.  They're all kind of dancing.  Are they?  Yeah, they're doing like...  Anyone tapping out?  Is it burning?  No?  No?  All right.  Why don't we...  Why don't you guys do some of those bicycles as we go to break? 
[02:52:00]  When we get back, we'll get the winner of this contest.  We'll get Andy Samberg in here from Hot Rod, and we'll do some demolition on Pal Talk.  Get the word out on Pal Talk.  Some dude's going to blow up a lot of dynamite.  They're doing the bicycle.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it really is.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, God.  And you can only hope that some sweat is building up, and it's now dripping down into their assholes.  Matt, you're flailing around. 
[02:52:30]  You're not really got you.  Oh, oh.  How's that, Dan?  How's my form?  What was that?  He said, how's my form?  Your form's pretty good, yeah.  Oh.  Jared, you can learn a thing or two from this, you know?  Yeah, it's called exercise.  Jared looks like a rape victim.  Yeah, he really does.  Why are you...  You okay there, Jared?  I'm fine.  I'm just a little traumatized.  Yeah, you really are.  Why are you traumatized?  Dramatized.  Traumatized.  You all right?  Traumatized.  What's the matter?  I'm fine.  You look really fucked up. 
[02:53:00]  Wait, what happened?  What's wrong?  This is not how I envisioned today.  No?  I usually like to be prepped into, like, you know, knowing what I'm doing.  Yeah, that's kind of the surprise thing goes right in.  We love the surprise thing with this show, you know.  You know what might make you feel better?  Could you grab his duty hat and put his duty hat on?  Yeah, it always makes him happy.  There.  It's just been hanging on the wall.  Yeah, he needs his duty hat.  For a moment like this.  There you go.  Jared, there's your duty hat.  Yeah.  Jared, that's a little familiarity for you. 
[02:53:30]  You all right there?  You got a lot of shame in your face.  You seem like you're really in, like, there you go.  That's better.  There you are.  Now he's got it.  He's got his duty hat.  I'm feeling a lot better now, actually.  He's going to kill himself, and we're all going to have to think it's us.  He's all slouched over, and there's a lot of shame going on.  What happened?  Yeah, you okay?  Did this bring back some weird memory or something?  Yeah, my interview.  Cool.  With Steve.  The interview where they said you would learn something about radio?  No, the interview where you guys made me take off my clothes, and then Bob Kelly shaved 
[02:54:00]  me.  All right.  Drew all over me.  Yeah, we drew all over your body.  Felt like a sorority girl.  Well, just pointing out things that might be wrong with your body, you know.  Everything?  Nah.  You got nice kneecaps.  Yeah.  Something.  All right, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, Dynamite Explosion on Top Talk, and hopefully the conclusion of our 
[02:54:30]  Hot Rod competition.  You guys got any other ideas for these guys?  We have a whole list of calisthenics they could go through.  All right.  And can we play that weird promo one more time?  The Hot Rod Contest promo.  I got to hear this.  Again.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue in a minute or two.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, it's the Hottest Rod Contest.  Brought to you by the movie Hot Rod.

[02:55:00]  August 3rd.  What is the Hottest Rod Contest?  That's obvious.  Let the conversation begin.  Wow.  That's a big day.  Well, you'd come into the studio, paint up your cock with Icy Hot, and the last  person standing after a hefty amount of phallic physicality wins $500.  Losers go home with a burning dick and some Shikliad lying around the office.  Want to compete?  Email travis at foundrymusic.com.  That's travis at foundrymusic.com.  It's the Hottest Rod Contest, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:55:30]  Brought to you by the movie Hot Rod in theaters August 3rd.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony show scream along.  Shut up, shut up.  Okay, terrific.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:56:00]  All right, we're back.  Jared, you all right over there?  He looks really, really sad.  Just sitting there in his Hot Rod underpants and his duty hat on.  Slouched over.  A lot of shame on his face.  We've put him through some stuff in the past, but I've never seen such shame. 
[02:56:30]  What's going on, Jared?  What's wrong?  I'm just afraid.  Why are you afraid?  Why can't I hear him?  I really don't want to do any real...  All right, never mind.  Could you turn the...  I was going to say...  Turn that around.  Say what you want to say.  I was going to say I really don't want to do any gay shit, but...  Any more gay shit, rather.  Thank you, Sam.  Well, Sam's been coaching him over there.  What did you say, Sam?  This is the difference between being an intern and what?  No, I said we all had to do it when we were interns. 
[02:57:00]  Sometimes...  Oh, yeah.  I told him it was the difference between just being an intern and being immortal.  Sometimes you just got to take one for the team.  Immortal.  All right.  We got Jared Cam now.  You can see him in his duty hat.  He's got his duty hat.  As he's wearing his Hot Rod underpants.  All right.  Mark from PalTalks ready to blow up some dynamite.  Hopefully, this will be...  I don't know.  We've never seen it before.  Something for the PalTalk people.  All right.  Mark, what do you got? 
[02:57:30]  See what the hell happens.  We're here with Spunky Construction.  We have about 137 holes filled with 1,500 pounds of dynamite.  Okay.  All right.  We're throwing up the ground for a water line, and we're ready to go.  All right.  What do you do?  A countdown?  Yeah, we can do a countdown.  We'll blow a horn a few times to let people in the area know we're doing it,  and then we just push a button and let it go.  All right.  We're going to hear it over that phone?  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to put the phone up in the air, and I hope...  Yeah, hopefully, you will.  We'll, you know, see. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  You let me know, and I'll put the phone in the air, and there we go.  Let's give it a whirl.  Yeah, let's roll.  All right.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  I can turn that off and go for it.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Fire in the hole. 
[02:58:30]  Delay.  Well, I heard something on the phone, and then the camera, like...  But I see nothing on...  Oh, there, on E-Roc's camera, I saw something.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  Did some damage.  It was a little delayed.  It was very delayed, and then you just saw, like, stuff frozen in midair.  The camera kind of couldn't keep up.  Wow, Mark.  Unbelievable.  I appreciate it.  Something different. 
[02:59:00]  I appreciate it.  Wow, a huge pile of dirt that made, huh?  Back to, um...  All right, Mark, thank you.  Back to blowing guys that have been gay, uh, dicks.  Speaking of blowing things up, we, uh, yeah, we'll be blowing on guys some more here.  Five, four, three, two, one, suck.  That's Jason from Rye.  Absolutely right, Jason.  Yeah.  All right, uh, Jared, you willing to help us out with the contest, or what?  Depends.  No payoff Tuesday.  They're calling it no payoff Tuesday. 
[02:59:30]  Cigars and scotch.  Very funny.  They want to know if Jared's crying, because he kind of looks like he's crying.  Jared, what...  This tapped into something.  What's up?  You were forced to do gay things when you were young?  No, it taps back right into the interview.  What happened at the interview?  You guys don't, you guys don't remember.  I, uh...  I'm not really...  Oh, well, we humiliated you.  Yeah.  What did we do?  You guys brought me on, and, uh...  You said already.  I had to sit, like, in the studio.  Naked.  Naked.  And then Bob Kelly drew all over me, and...  Why is... 
[03:00:00]  Why is...  Why is...  Why do we want to take his clothes off?  Well, Bob, uh...  It's really a good question, man.  I don't know.  Bob then highlighted his problem areas with a Sharpie.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that really bothered you, obviously.  That sort of, uh...  Yeah.  A lot of people heard that, and, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, well, you know.  Whatever.  You're not going to go on a shooting spree or anything, are you?  No.  Yeah, okay.  Don't worry, you're safe.  All right.  Why don't we... 
[03:00:30]  Why don't we, uh...  Get to the next stage of the hot rod contest.  What is it, uh, Than?  Well, there's two places they could use these.  I like...  Well, the one I thought of, you could call it a pig in a blanket.  Mm-hmm.  Because these are, uh, Bengay pain-relieving patches.  Ah, Bengay pain-relieving patches.  So, what you're saying is to take it and then put their junk in it like a hot dog in a roll.  Yeah, like those delicious hors d'oeuvres. 
[03:01:00]  By the way, uh, Thay, when did you realize that this, uh, bit was very disappointed?  Pointing.  I think we're just getting some steam going now, Ope.  All right.  I'm looking at the pictures of Jared with Bob Kelly, like, circling all the things wrong with his body.  It was Bob Kelly that did it to you.  Bob Kelly's bigger than you are, Jared.  And way more out of shape than you are, Jared.  Can you not open it? 
[03:01:30]  All right, what are we doing?  I just wanted to wipe my hand.  I gotta go to work.  Wait, what?  What?  Trouble opening there.  You still have to go to work where?  At the word.  I don't want to say the company name.  Oh, wow.  I'm actually going to eat at, uh, FH Riley's 400.  New York Avenue, in the heart of Huntington.  Oh.  Thank you, Matt.  My brother's joint.  Best plug.  All right, uh, why don't we, uh, wrap him up like a, like a, a hot dog, Frank?  Now, what are we wrapping up exactly?  Which area?  What are you wrapping?  Which area?  You gotta take that and, uh, put your dick in it. 
[03:02:00]  And, and, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Like, wrap it around your dick.  All right, where's Steve?  That guy's got a bigger one?  What?  That's good.  Where's Steve?  He's gotta make sure this.  He's not really staying.  Huh?  I'm right.  Steve, make sure.  It's not staying?  Make sure they're making, um, one of you, Bengay wieners.  It's close up right now.  What?  Did you take off the thing like, uh, Rob's doing there?  It's got, it's got a backing on it.  That would help.  Ah, no.  All right.  Make sure he gets it on there. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  You make sure, Steve.  I'm doing it.  I'm, look at the Jared cam.  I've never seen a worse profile in my life.  He is really, uh.  Show the, not happy.  Well, where is it?  Maybe it lost.  It lost it.  There it goes.  See it?  I'm putting scotch tape on you.  All right.  Are they wrapping their wieners up?  Yeah, they are.  They are.  It's just.  It's a Bengay wiener.  Yeah, he's wrapped up.  Rob's all wrapped up.  I'm wrapped.  All right.  It's a Bengay, uh, wiener. 
[03:03:00]  This should, uh.  You, uh, wrapped?  This should kill two minutes.  What?  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  What's it doing?  What's up, Rob?  It comes in a real strong wave.  Yeah.  It doesn't waste any time.  It hits you.  Yeah.  Anybody else feeling anything?  Yeah.  Teet it up a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  Mine's burnt.  Really burning?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what those fucking things do.  Wow.  Holy shit. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, pretty bad, huh?  Mm-hmm.  But.  You're supposed to, like, slap those on if, I guess, you pull a muscle.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm a trooper.  All right.  Whoa.  Oh, what's the matter?  Whoa.  Yeah, it's real hot now.  Oh.  You can tap out any time.  No.  No tap.  No tap?  No tap.  No tap.  Rob?  No way.  It's hot, Rob, isn't it?  A little hot?  It is.  Wow.  Maybe.  What about cleansing the palate? 
[03:04:00]  Taking some bottles of water?  Bottles of water or paper towels with water on them.  They have to wipe it all off with wet paper towel.  How about they just pour some water down there?  If that hurts, I think.  Yeah.  I've never done this before.  Well, that'll heat it up a little bit, right?  How's Jared doing?  Wow.  Who's suggesting each takes a turn on the stripper pole?  Oh, stop.  E-Rock?  Jared, do you have any ideas for this contest?  I think there should be a running in place. 
[03:04:30]  Well, they, uh...  Yeah.  Before running in place.  The water's being applied.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Do you have scoliosis?  That's what I'm saying.  I just have bad posture.  No?  Is it just...  Okay, I'm just asking.  Nope.  No drinking.  I have never seen a head sit on top of a body like that before.  Like your back.  You got, like, um...  It's really strange.  Sit straight up.  Sit straight.  Hey, why can't you just do that?  It's not comfortable.  Yeah?  Well, it's more comfortable... 
[03:05:00]  For us.  It's much more...  Jesus.  Alright, now what are they doing?  Well, Matt is looking to up the ante a little.  And do what?  What do you want to do?  I'm going to shave.  What?  Alright.  Can I tap out?  The hosts are leaving the radio show.  Can we tap out?  Why do you want to shave?  Listen, I got to bring something to the table.  I'm used to being Radio Gold, being the Super Bowl champ. 
[03:05:30]  And I'm upping the ante right here.  To end it.  So what do you do?  You just shave your...  I'm going to use the Icy Hot as my shaving cream.  That's got to hurt.  Alright, that could hurt.  Alright, Steve.  Make sure you change.  This is the freestyle portion of the competition.  The freestyle portion, sure.  If any of you guys want to freestyle, come up with your own suggestions on what you could  do that might sound painful, feel free.  His idea of shaving with the Icy Hot. 
[03:06:00]  And by the way, you could use Jared any way you want.  Yeah, yeah.  In a freestyle competition.  I would say if you only use Icy Hot as a lubricant while fucking Jared in the ass, that  would probably win.  I don't see anyone beating that.  No.  Sports fans.  Poor Jared.  Alright, what do you got?  Uh, wow, people are saying Radio Gold, Radio Gold, but they're calling Jared Radio Clay. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, Jared.  Poor Jared.  Poor Jared.  Radio Bush.  Do you go to the gym?  Work out.  You work out by yourself?  You're not doing it right.  Jared, what is wrong, man?  I'm fine.  You're a big downer.  Wow.  I'm fine.  He's got like his hands in his mouth and he's talking with his hands in his mouth.  I work out all along.  I work.  You do?  You work out all along?  Yeah.  I only have a treadmill and a step machine at home.  The treadmill at home.  Maybe you should take the coats off it.  That's all.  Oh, boy. 
[03:07:00]  Alright.  Alright, let's go, Matt.  You decided to start the freestyle round.  He's going to shave.  Steve, where's Steve?  He's got one of those Bic razors.  Steve, you've got to make...  Where's Jocko?  What?  He's going to rub the Icy Hot on as shaving cream.  I'll put it in your pocket.  And he's going to shave his package.  There he goes.  He's smearing the Icy Hot on the razor blade. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  On the, uh...  Alright.  Jesus.  Now, uh...  Did you bring three razors?  Oh!  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  We can drum some up.  You offering?  Yeah, go ahead.  You offering?  Let's do it.  Here he goes.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy shit.  This might tap him out.  That hurt.  How's it feel?  Yeah, he's shaving.  There's pubes coming off in that.  Oh. 
[03:08:00]  Well, Jared, someone's going to have to clean up those pubes.  And I think the guy with the doody hat.  Why does it say sad sack now on this?  Alright, Jared.  Jared's, uh...  Jared's in his hot rod underpants.  Hot rod on these.  What the fuck?  I need to clean.  This is the worst bit ever.  Alright, what's going on?  Absolutely worst bit we've ever done.  Matt, what do you got going on? 
[03:08:30]  You shaved?  I'll clean it off my razor for me.  Who's cleaning off your razor for you?  Jared.  Alright, Jared.  Oh.  Jared.  What do you guys think of Jared's doody hat?  It's cute.  It's precious.  It's doody.  I think you gotta go underneath with the razor.  Or else it doesn't work right.  What?  What, the balls?  You gotta go for gold.  Are you saying you want them to shave their balls?  Yes.  I think that's...  Alright.  That's what you want.  I'm pretty clean up top.  Alright, they're using Bengay. 
[03:09:00]  As shaving cream.  Oh, God.  You wanted it.  I didn't want shit.  You asked for it.  You got it.  Oh, my God.  Woo.  Woo.  Ha.  Oh, that's not right.  Jared.  Jared, I need another cleaning.  Alright, Jared.  Walking over in his hot rod underpants.  I need a little wipe here.  Hey, Jared.  They're casting Tommy Boy 2.  It's not that bad.  I don't know what they're complaining about. 
[03:09:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Smack talk.  Alright.  There's Jared on pound talk.  His hot rod pants.  Panties.  They're like guy panties, I think.  Where you going?  Hot rod.  Alright.  Right here.  Next to Anthony.  Oh, shit.  Alright, what's going on?  Now they're shaving.  Oh, that hurt?  Cool.  Are you nicking yourself a little?  They're jumping up and down a little bit.  Oh, that really fucking burns.  Yeah, this should knock somebody out of the competition.  I'm thinking.  You want a bag? 
[03:10:00]  These guys are dedicated.  What are you saying?  My bag's already shaved, bro.  Oh, God.  This is the worst.  There's so many women here.  Teddy.  Why don't we listen to Teddy from Pittsburgh's suggestion?  Teddy.  Yes.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to suggest a pube beard.  They all have to wear their own pubes as a beard.  Well, no.  You said Jared should wear a pube beard.  Jared.  Should we take off a collection to see if Jared would wear a pube beard? 
[03:10:30]  Jared.  Oh, my God, Andy's reaching into his pocket.  Jared.  Jared.  Would you wear a pube beard for a few bucks?  How much is a few bucks?  Oh, fuck.  Let me see what I got here.  I'm going to open the vault and get my wallet.  All right.  Here is $100.  Wow, $100. 
[03:11:00]  I'm sitting in my head for $400.  Now you're asking me to put a...  Yeah, but this isn't as gross, dude.  This is just silly.  Another guy...  Silly is worth less money.  I don't know where these guys have been.  Silly?  It's just on your chin.  Look at those pubes.  It's just on your chin.  Wait, wait, get some glue.  Don't use the Bengay.  Not glue.  Something that will make it sticky. 
[03:11:30]  What?  How do we make a pube beard?  Don't use the Bengay.  Questions that should never be asked.  I'll tell you what.  Here's all I can spare today, because I didn't think we were going into any competition.  I think it's $670.  I have $170.  All right, here.  $170 right there for the wearing of the pube beard.  Here, here.  I'll make it...  I'm light today.  Here. 
[03:12:00]  Making it even too.  Okay.  It's an additional $30, which makes it $200.50.  All right.  Now, do we have glue or something?  I don't want them to use the Bengay, but we've got to make sure...  Why not?  You want the...  Yeah?  The Bengay should stick.  It'll stick, though.  Huh?  All right.  How many pubes have we collected from the boys?  I can give you more now.  All right.  Matt, why don't you get some...  I could give you more.  Give me a paper towel.  I could scrounge up a few.  All right.  They're scrounging up the pubes for the pube beard. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  Someone collect it on a...  Don't let Jared collect it.  Well, he's doing so good.  I don't have much.  I don't think I want to do this one.  What?  What?  You don't want to do this one?  What's wrong?  I think I'm about to send this one out, actually.  Yeah?  Oh, no, no.  You can't.  Jared, but...  Jared, we're in the middle of a radio war.  It's $200.  Talk to your guy, Sam. 
[03:13:00]  It's $200, and you just wear it as a little goatee.  $200.  This one's not a big deal compared to the other ones.  Yeah.  If you send this one out, then they're not going to call on you anymore.  They're going to start calling on Pat Duffy.  Oh, wow.  They switched me out for Pat Duffy.  Oh, they didn't switch me out.  No, no.  This could bring you right back in.  Jared, this is how it works.  Pube beard, pube beard, pube beard, pube beard, pube beard.  No, that's too thick.  No?  I think I have a week and a half left.  Huh?  It's got tape. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  You know what?  I'll tell you this much.  No, tape ain't good either.  We're going to stick to his skin.  Maybe we could extend your internship if you do pube beard.  Ah.  Can't guarantee it.  We've got to go through the proper authorities, but...  For how long?  A day or two.  Okay, here's what he's got to do.  Take a thin layer, a thin layer of Icy Hot and put it down here on your chin.  Right.  Then take the pubes and smash the paper towel against there and dab it and get a little 
[03:14:00]  of the pubes over your chin.  All right?  Yeah, don't put it there.  Don't ever put it there.  Steve, have we collected enough pubes for the pube beard?  Is that the final amount of pubes?  I thought there was more.  No, I'm worried.  Oh, wait.  There's more over here.  Oh, he's got more pubes over there.  Okay, there you go.  He's counting his money.  Jared, could you...  You got city hands, Mr. Hooper?  I got crazy glue.  No.  There it is.  Chopstick.  There you go.  That's like fucking 200 bucks for nothing. 
[03:14:30]  What?  How much is it?  $200 and...  And 50 cents, my friend.  I got a tip.  All right, is there enough pubes, though?  You got a tip, all right.  This is some hard-earned money here.  Matt, I think Matt can step up in the pube department.  I don't really give a shit anymore.  Yeah, he's going to just...  All right, Matt is just going to town to get enough pubes for the pube beard.  This is degenerated.  Jared, who's wearing his hot rod underpants.  How did it go from a contest between three guys to just this Jared thing again? 
[03:15:00]  What kind of beard are we going to make?  I think...  Sam's got a suggestion.  I want a Fu Manchu.  I want like a Thingo T.  Jared wants to up the ante just a little.  He wants to know if Andy Samberg can sign his hot rod underpants when he comes in.  Well, you'll have to ask Andy, but I'm sure he would.  I'm surprised Anthony didn't recommend the Hitler. 
[03:15:30]  Well, someone is suggesting...  Someone on Pal Talk went by way too fast, but what a great line.  They're suggesting the ZZ Top beer.  I don't think we have enough.  The Fu Manchu.  All right, Steve, let me see the pubes that have been collected.  Do we got a nice supply?  Got a scissor?  I'll do some more damage with a scissor.  All right, get a scissor for Matt.  I don't care how we...  Get a scissor.  I don't care how we harvest the pubes. 
[03:16:00]  Yes, harvest up the pubes.  Oh, my God.  All right, who's going to be the...  Don't let him fall.  All right, who's going to be the makeup artist?  Someone have rubber gloves?  Yeah, get some rubber gloves.  I thought I could do it.  Oh, really?  Can you make a good beard, you think?  I'll try.  All right, what we want is your standard go-to.  Okay, you got to have a little over the lip and then underneath.  All right, the scissors have been handed to Matt to harvest more pubes.  You're going to use Icy Hot? 
[03:16:30]  No, why am I using Icy Hot?  Why?  Because it'll act like an adhesive.  So you smear it in a thin...  It'll burn a little bit.  It'll burn a little bit, but not much.  Well, the pube beard itself is the big get,  so maybe we can use something else to apply the pube beard so he gets it done.  What else we got?  But that's what we have.  You got Vaseline or something?  All right, we're going to put lipstick on you, too, Jared.  Vaseline might work.  Why?  Vaseline would work, no? 
[03:17:00]  A light coating?  Yeah, do we have Vaseline?  Do we have Vaseline?  A scrotum with Icy Hot on it.  That's why I'm saying the Icy Hot, I think, will work good.  Go look in Steve's book bag.  Go get some Vaseline.  Vaseline.  Lipstick?  Lipstick.  This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  The rest makes perfect sense.  You know you're right.  You know you're right.  Get rid of the lipstick.  You're right.  See?  We'll back you up.  You don't need the lipstick.  All right, Matt is presenting.  Ah, see?  Now he got a lot more. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, a pube mustache.  Wow, that's enough for an entire pube mustache.  That is like, you can look like McCloud with that mustache.  That's a lot of mustache.  Where's that came from, buddy?  I hope it's something I can add to the show that maybe will help these contestants.  Okay.  They each take a shot, me kicking them in the nuts.  So the pube beard, how are we going to get this on?  We got the Vaseline, what do we got?  I think we're going to have to use the Icy Hunt. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  I think that's all we got.  All right.  So a thin layer.  What?  Well, how am I supposed to take it off if water only makes it work?  No, just take a thin layer.  You just wipe it off with a paper towel at first, and then it'll get okay.  Take a thin, put some on your fingertip, and take a thin layer, and just put it over  your lip, and then on your chin.  Eric from Jersey.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, how about the Hulk Hogan mustache so Ira can relate to him?  Ooh, should we go with the Hulk Hogan mustache for E-Rock? 
[03:18:30]  Oh, Hulk Hogan.  Oh, he's all silhouetted by the shade.  By the way, why don't you go into the bathroom and apply the Icy Hunt?  Not the pube beard.  All right, there goes Jared in his underpants.  Wow.  From his hot rod underpants.  And can he apply the pubes somewhere where we can see it on Palto?  Look, his back is to the window, and it's glaring horribly.  Do we have a mirror? 
[03:19:00]  It should be a...  All right, how about we just bring the pews into the bathroom?  And a microphone?  All right.  All right, they're going into the bathroom now with the camera there.  Why is the camera sideways?  Camera sideways.  What the hell is going on?  Going in with the camera, for Christ's sake.  Yeah, we've got to steady the camera.  They're terrible with the camera in the bathroom.  Should we just do it out here? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Do it where Jimmy sits.  All right.  Do we have a mirror?  Uh, no, no.  Yeah, do it where Jimmy sits.  Good idea.  Oh, look at his face.  All right, he's...  All right, someone's going to have to help him.  E-Rock, put some gloves on.  Come over here.  Go get your pubes.  Sorry.  Yeah, go get your pubes.  This is the pube beard.  Part of the hot rod contest.  Nice, wide, wide berth behind me.  Wide berth.  Walk slow so they don't flutter out anywhere.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Here's a pedestal.  And...  Here's your pube pedestal.  All right, here, you can put the pubes on the...  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of fucking pubes, bro.  All right, he's got his pube pedestal.  What the hell is that about?  Okay, um...  Trying to get him in frame here.  There we go.  Down a little.  It's kind of burning now.  There's a little bit.  Wait, that's all you're going to...  You can only put it down there?  Oh.  Well, you got to smear it around a little bit. 
[03:20:30]  Goatee.  No, no, it's a goatee, not a Van Dyke or something.  So smear it around a little bit.  A little bit.  There you go.  You got to round your upper lip, too?  Yeah.  Okay, let's go.  Do you think it'll stick?  All right, pube beard.  Give me a little more.  I think it's fine.  Yeah, it'll be all right.  Yeah?  All right, now over the lip with the big mustache.  Go with the big puby mustache.  Do we have a mirror for this?  If it takes him a couple tries.  Just figure it out.  Make sure you do it over the pedestal.  The puby pedestal.  All right, we'll tell you when...  Are you sure, Anthony, you don't want me to do the Hitler? 
[03:21:00]  No.  No, that's okay.  I wouldn't want to see two people degraded.  I hope none of you guys have crabs.  No one's got crabs.  No one has crabs.  Let's jump.  What's that?  I don't know.  Look.  Rob.  Quick, before you're...  Come on.  He's just fucking with you.  Let's get the...  Okay, now press hard because it's going to mold a good mustache out of it. 
[03:21:30]  Now press hard.  Nothing a little penicillin can't take care of.  Press.  All right, let's see.  Is it sticking?  All right, it's sticking a little bit.  All right.  That kind of is a Hitler.  Oh, it fell off.  Oh, see, it fell off.  Shit.  See, it fell off.  I think you need more Icy Hot.  We need something that makes this stick.  Come on, we need something sticky.  Well, you dropped the pubs on the floor.  What do you got?  You dropped your pube mustache.  Tony's in here.  What do you got, Tony?  Mayo? 
[03:22:00]  A thing of mayo.  Reminiscent of the cream pie.  I put some mayo on there.  And where did the big thing of pubes go?  Did you drop it on the floor?  On my face.  No, it's not.  Jared, there's something on the floor.  It fell on the floor.  What is that?  Need more?  Well, we need the pubes.  Just smear the mayo all over your face.  Smear the mayo.  There you go.  It's fantastic.  More.  Get a lot on it.  Now, yeah, get it.  Get it pretty thick.  There.  Because it's got to all stick in there.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  There you go.  There you go.  Now on the beard portion.  All right, very good.  A little more.  A little more.  I'm just not happy.  I don't think you're happy.  Get a big glob.  All right.  All right.  Let's see if this works.  Okay.  Now get the one that you dropped.  Where did that go?  There's big.  There it is.  Now, now press that on as a mustache.  Oh, that's sticking much better now.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  Much better.  Clean off your mayonnaise hands.  Much better. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now we're talking pubie mustache.  All right.  Pubie mustache into a pubie-like goatee.  All right.  The pubes are bloodshed.  Okay.  A little more.  Yeah.  Almost.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little more under the nostril.  You almost got it.  And.  Yeah.  He's doing with a Hitler.  Pretty good Hitler. 
[03:23:30]  How about a little on the beard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just kind of put the whole paper towel against your face.  That one.  That'll stick.  You guys got any more?  Of course.  Yeah.  What does this go?  Electric razor?  What do you got?  Just kind of push that against your chin.  Let me see how that looks.  It's on one side.  It's all on one side.  Yeah.  Very sloppy beard so far.  Oh, Jesus.  Get a good one. 
[03:24:00]  Get a good one.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  He's putting it right in the middle there.  Oh, that's good.  Wow.  That's kind of like Hollywood makeup.  That's a pretty good beard right there.  Wait.  Matt was offering up more pubes.  Why did you wave them off?  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  There you go.  Might as well.  What side does he need it on, Sam?  Right here.  Yeah.  That side.  No, we're fine.  There you go.  All right.  Jared has kind of has a pube goatee. 
[03:24:30]  It's like puby mange.  Oh, Jared.  Oh, Jared.  All right.  Let me see.  Bye.  You guys know I wouldn't.  There's nothing I wouldn't do for the show.  See?  This shows it right here.  Very good.  That is something.  There you go.  All right.  There's your pube.  Pubey beard and mustache.  Can I take it off now? 
[03:25:00]  We got it on the video, right?  Here.  Peek right into the pal talk camera and hold still.  So everyone could see.  Go closer.  No, get close.  Get like real, real close.  Closer.  Wear me proud, Jared.  And hold it.  Hold it.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Right there.  So people can get a good look.  Turn your head a little so they see that other side.  There it is.  Now hold still.  Oh, that's nice.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Wow.  This is exciting.  All right.  You can take that off.  All right. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, ew.  He's just wiping pubes off his face.  All right.  Now what do we got, guys?  It's the hot rod contest.  Is it?  Yeah.  Sure is.  We've got mousetraps.  Mousetraps.  We're going to up the ante and have them take their icy hot mousetraps.  I don't feel like finishing this sentence.  Scrotum and putting a mousetrap in it.  All right.  All right, guys.  Ready?  We need a reapplication.  I need some more icy hot. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  Hey, is Andy Sandberg here?  Not quite yet.  Where is he?  Did he decide to blow this show off?  Perhaps he has an XM unit in his car.  Yeah.  All right.  Now what?  What?  One minute for what?  One minute?  Is he coming upstairs?  He's here right now.  Where is he?  He's coming up.  All right.  Bring him right in.  Oh, of course.  We want him to wait now. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  Andy Sandberg, everybody.  Hey, where are you going, Jared?  Jared.  Jared.  Here, you can sit.  Just sit down.  Put your duty hat on.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  This has gotten so bad.  Andy, we're all big fans, and we're very excited about Hot Rod.  Oh, thank you.  I don't want you to get the wrong first impression either of this show.  It's really gone bad.  It's taken a bad time.  This is happening in here.  Somebody suggested.  This is a really bad show. 
[03:27:00]  You know how salespeople are?  They're like really, they're weaselly and stupid, and they really don't have much creative  talent.  Sure.  They came up with an idea for Hot Rod to promote the movie.  You're getting a lot of promotion today.  I love it.  That these guys should take Icy Hot and rub it on their rods to get a hot rod.  And it's just turning into this big homoerotic mess. 
[03:27:30]  I know.  I feel like I walked into an episode of Rome.  Yeah, it really is like Rome.  Yeah.  It's gone real bad because we were hoping like, you know, we have three contestants.  We're thinking they're going to tap out.  But they never tapped out.  So then we had to get weirder.  So we got Jared to put on your hot rod underpants.  Why don't you stand up and show Andy Thamberg the official hot rod.  Why don't you spin around?  That's not the worst I had to do.  There you go.  Hot rod underpants.  Yeah, yeah.  Those look really sharp. 
[03:28:00]  So then we had Jared blow on the hot rods to heat up their hot rods more.  Because they need air flowing over them.  So he blew on them, which was really bad.  And then I don't know how it got to this point.  Oh, one of the guys decided he was going to pull away from the crowd by going freestyle  and shaving with the Icy Hot.  That's got to hurt.  So then with the pubes that were left, Jared decided he was going to make a puby mustache 
[03:28:30]  and beard, which, my God, you've just missed.  You've just missed that.  Yeah, you've just missed that bit of fun.  Sorry about that.  We should have waited.  For some reason, I don't think this explanation is helping the first impression.  I think this is making it worse.  I don't know.  I mean, this has far exceeded my expectations coming in.  This is way better than anything I could have possibly imagined.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  I wasn't sure.  So wait, all of you guys have Icy Hot all over your boners?  Oh, yeah.  So it's burning right now. 
[03:29:00]  Yes, it is.  A lot.  Yeah.  I think it's wearing off on Rob a little bit.  I just re-applicated.  Oh, you did.  So now, Andy.  Jesus Christ.  You walked in when they were about to start applying the mousetraps.  Yeah, now mousetraps.  All for the movie Hot Rod.  But this has nothing to do with the movie Hot Rod.  I like to think it has everything to do with the movie Hot Rod.  I mean, are we really doing mousetraps?  I would love to see that.  Yeah, yeah.  The mousetraps now are out.  They're loaded up. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, that's got to hurt.  That's going to hurt.  What are you going to do with the mousetrap?  I think we've got to wait until you put it on, and you've got to wait a minute or two for  it to peak, and you've got to go.  You've got to go.  Now, what's getting snapped in it?  The dick or the nuts?  I was going to go with the scrotum.  That's cool.  You're going to go with the scrotum.  Matt just saw his end.  Oh, what's the matter?  No, Matt just realized how he's going to win the contest.  And he's not going to give up on it.  His idea is not going to give it out. 
[03:30:00]  As soon as he said, I'm going bag, Matt was like, pfft.  He found a way around the defense.  He's going right toward the hoop now.  You're talking about butthole, right?  I don't know.  It could be.  He's got a couple tricks up his sleeve.  Taint.  He's going to try to lock his taint in a rat trap.  Matt is very famous for the radio show because he allowed wasps and yellow jackets to sting  his ball back.  Wow.  The last time.  Three nuts for about a week.  The last time we decided to do something.  Why don't we get girls in this studio? 
[03:30:30]  I don't know.  This is ridiculous.  Overrated.  Is it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't do any of this stuff.  It's all about ball bags.  It's terrible.  All right, so are we doing the mousetraps now?  All right.  We'll talk about Hot Rod with Amy Sam Burr while you guys do the mousetrap.  Yeah, get everything ready and we'll talk about it.  What's the movie about, sir?  It's about these dudes that snap their balls in mousetraps.  Oh, so it is.  I thought we were going way off piece here.  We couldn't be more on topic.  Yeah, Paramount is thrilled about it. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Hey, would you rather have like a boring regular interview or would you rather step into something  like this?  No, sir.  Let's be honest.  Would Matt Damon come in here and do this kind of thing?  Certainly not.  Never.  No.  Never.  And you'll never be back if Hot Rod does well at the box office.  Let's be honest.  You wish.  You wish.  You guys are too close to me for me to not come back.  Oh, they're putting him on a little stool there.  All right.  So what's going to happen?  I guess they're going to... 
[03:31:30]  God damn.  All right.  We got Rob.  He's placing his mousetraps on a stool.  Yeah, he's very meticulous.  Looks like he has an idea.  This is really going down.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  He's rubbing more.  Icy hot.  Oh, I thought it was fluffing.  Hey, it looked like it, didn't it?  By the way, that's not a diaper hanging out of his pants.  That was a Bengay strip.  Oh, my God.  Because we made human like hot dogs.  We're really trying to heat these things up to make hot rods.  But...  It smells so disgusting here. 
[03:32:00]  Doesn't it?  It's just really bad.  All right.  He's picking out a mousetrap.  All right.  Is he going for...  I don't know.  He's...  All right.  Let's get a mic on him.  He's got a lot of scrot out there.  It looks like he's got a handful of hubba-bubba.  And now he's...  All right.  Hold on.  Let's get a mic on this.  He's going to lay down his scrotum right into the trigger of the mousetrap.  Now, make sure your finger doesn't get caught in there.  That might hurt.  All right.  Here we go.  This never disappoints, this sound you're about to hear, Andy.  Hit a corner. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Watch this.  Here we go.  Watch this.  This is all for you, Andy.  Hot rod in theaters.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Motherfucker!  Oh, that's got to hurt a bit.  Oh, my God.  Hot rod.  Oh, yes.  You're not going to forget us anytime soon, Andy.  You know what I mean?  This is what the movie's all about.  I feel like I've been waiting my whole life for this.  Are you kidding? 
[03:33:00]  All right, Rob, what happened there?  Well, it stung a lot, and I'm going to do another one.  All right.  Wow.  You're going to do the other side.  The guy just shakes it off.  He knows how to walk it off.  All right.  Hot rod.  Here he goes.  The next one.  The theater's Friday.  Yeah.  Please keep saying that.  Here he goes.  All right.  Oh!  It's on!  And it's on!  Now it's stuck on his back.  It's on!  Ah!  And it's off.  Well, it's greasy, so it just falls off.  Smart.  Smart thinking. 
[03:33:30]  Nothing better than a greasy sack.  All right.  Should we move on to the next guy?  Rob impressed, Andy.  It's horrible.  All right.  Horribly entertaining.  What happened?  All right, Dan?  What do you got?  Dan, what do you think?  You going to up it up, or just do the same thing?  Well, you can do the same thing, but, ah.  Whatever.  I'm not looking.  You know?  Yeah, the same.  Okay.  Dan seems a little relaxed.  You can do whatever you want.  We're going penis.  Holy shit.  I can't.  All right.  Yeah, pull that.  You got to work it up a little bit. 
[03:34:00]  You got to work it up.  Who are you trying to impress?  That was probably the most casual I've ever heard someone say.  Yeah.  We're going penis.  We're going penis.  All right.  All right.  Great news, everybody.  All right.  Here he goes.  Oh, well, it's kind of in the pants, but that's fine.  I have no problem with that.  Yeah, I think everyone can agree that's for the best.  Yeah.  All for the best.  And what's the mess, Steve?  You got a problem?  What?  You want it in your mouth first?  What the fuck are you doing?  Yes, please.  This was, that was, guys, do what you want, but that was the one thing that we were told 
[03:34:30]  not to, the one organ that we were told not to put in a mouse.  Bag no donk?  Dumped out of that explanation.  All right.  Go ahead.  That's that, man.  Nah, fuck it.  I'll do big.  Fuck it.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Hot Rod in theaters Friday.  Friday.  Yes.  It's a classy film.  Fun for the whole family.  Yes.  Right?  Absolutely. 
[03:35:00]  Just like this.  Oh, dude.  Oh, no.  That's his actual ball.  Are you crazy?  Wait, wait.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  I can't take this.  Did he just.  What the fuck?  Why are we doing this?  You know, I had these dreams and images of radio. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  That I would get an Edward R. Murrow award for something.  Dude, did he do his fucking actual ball?  Yeah, and it kind of slipped down onto his sack.  He did a last minute substitution.  What's he doing?  Oh, my God.  He's going for two on there?  Here.  Do you want me to help you, sir, a little bit?  Like a puzzle.  Really?  Really thin.  I just mean positioning him out.  I mean, it should be noted that the trap is still on there right now.  Yeah, yeah.  He's going to try to get two on.  That's quite the trick.  Without triggering the.  Oh, boy. 
[03:36:00]  No.  Oh, a misfire.  A misfire.  All right.  Oh, that'll cost him some valuable points.  Russian judge doesn't like that.  Hot Rod.  What?  Friday.  Friday.  This Friday.  This Friday.  What's it about, Andy?  Yeah.  It's about a stuntman who's terrible at stunts.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So it's kind of like a stunt thing going on.  It's like, okay, so imagine if you were, like, say, snapping your balls in a mousetrap.  Sure.  But then imagine a big ramp and crashing instead.  Right.  On a bike. 
[03:36:30]  So it's similar, only completely different.  Yeah, this is like a microcosmic version of the movie.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I saw the trailer.  Oh, nice.  It's very funny.  Thank you.  I like that kind of, you know, look, it looks like someone's really going to be injured.  Oh, yeah.  That has always killed me.  There were some pretty brutal stunts done, actually, in the movie.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, like, not by me, necessarily.  I was going to ask.  What was the craziest stunt?  A lot of actors like saying, I did my own stunts.  Yeah, but hold on.  What was the craziest stunt you did for the movie?  I got smacked in the face a bunch with a stick by Ian McShane. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  I took some spills down the hill.  Ball bag in a mousetrap?  I did nothing compared to what these dudes are doing.  I'm not going to even pretend.  I wouldn't even try.  But, you know, I'm the star of a movie.  I'm not crazy.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You're looking at the favorite here.  This is Matt.  Matt is stepping up to the mousetrap.  He's got something planned.  I don't know what it is.  He's lining three up.  All right.  Great.  That's the least amount I'm going to be putting on there. 
[03:37:30]  All right.  Well, he's got a lot of elasticity.  This might help him.  That's one.  He's going for the other side, folks.  Wow.  Keep them fucking coming.  Keep them coming.  Where do you guys get these fabulous boxes?  Hot Rod in theaters this Friday.  Thanks, Matt.  Oh, look at that.  There goes number two.  All right, Matt.  And two.  He's got one on each side of his scrotum. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Okay.  We're definitely going to pull a quote for this.  Let's go for the middle.  For the Hot Rod newspaper ads.  All right.  He's going to go for...  He's trying to find more scrotum.  He's getting a little more real estate.  He's got two hanging off right now.  He's going for a third.  Oh, my God.  This is going to be...  It is Friday.  Oh, man.  He has three mousetraps hanging.  That's got to be victory. 
[03:38:30]  Unbelievable.  What a day for a scrotum mousetrap sport.  Lost one.  Yeah.  A testicle?  Yes.  Or a mousetrap?  Then he's going for another.  Yeah.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Oh, now they're just falling off.  It's a catastrophe.  It's a catastrophe.  Even the mousetraps went out of this thing.  You really seem to have a leapfrogged in front of some of your cast members on SNL.  Oh, good.  Like, as far as popularity and movie. 
[03:39:00]  Like, all of a sudden...  You're welcome.  How long ago were you one of those?  And, you know, the extra guys.  First season, I was that.  And then...  Back in 70...  76, I believe it was.  75.  First season.  Pre-show.  It was pretty good.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  So, how many years ago were you like the extra guy?  Two.  I've done two seasons.  They moved all the feature players up last year.  Me, Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, and Kristen Wiig.  Right.  And you kind of like now... 
[03:39:30]  You stand out.  You make a movie.  Any jealousy in the hallways?  No, sir.  No?  All one big happy family?  The good news about it is everyone at the show is working outside of the show, so everyone  kind of is kicking ass.  That's kind of true.  It is.  All right.  It makes it a lot easier for me to answer that question.  All I could think of is Jim Brewer's horror stories from SNL whenever I talk to a current  cast member and go, oh my God, he's got to be lying.  He's got to be horrible.  I will say, a lot of people tell us about, like, you know, there were times when it was 
[03:40:00]  brutal and da-da-da, but right now it's just great.  It's good.  And so, I mean, we've only been there two years, so all we can do is be like, cool.  You look forward to the brutal times.  Yeah, exactly.  It's something like that.  I think he's exed.  And then he's an internet sensation, too.  I mean, he's got a lot of popularity with all those videos.  Well, his videos and films are great, yeah.  The YouTube is very funny.  Dick in a box, let's not forget.  Let us not.  Dick in a box.  And you performed that in front of 18,000 people, right?  At Madison Square.  Wow.  With Justin Timberlake.  Mm-hmm.  Jay Tizzle.  Took it to the streets. 
[03:40:30]  Jay Tizzle.  Took it to the streets, y'all.  What did that feel like?  Like a million doll hairs.  What we did is we took the product and we took it straight to the people.  You know what I mean?  Which is, that's what JT's all about.  That video's been viewed millions of times, though, man.  That's awesome.  Thanks, dude.  Because everybody listening, we all want that one video that goes.  Anthony got a video that went.  I had a pretty big one.  It got, you know, nothing, please.  I'm not even trying to compare.  But it's well over a million views on pretty much every single. 
[03:41:00]  A few mil.  A few mil now.  One version's well over a mil, and then you got some other versions.  And I took advantage of the whole hatred of Windows and Mac people.  Oh, nice.  By taking, because I wanted to upgrade to Vista.  Uh-huh.  I had a computer that was Vista-ready.  I had bought it like months before, and they go, Vista's not out yet, but this is so Vista-ready.  When Vista comes out, you just got to pop the disc in, and Vista's going to be on it.  Uh-huh.  And I'm pretty computer savvy.  So I get Vista, I go home, I pop it in, I'm getting the blue screen of death like eight 
[03:41:30]  times, nothing's working.  I had to recover everything, and it took me eight hours to get my computer right back  where I started before I tried to install Vista.  So I took the Vista disc, set up a video camera, and installed it on my shredder.  And it was amazing how easily it installed on the shredder.  Oh, it went right in there.  And it just took off.  People loved it.  And I got hate mail from people that, you know, said I'm an Apple fanboy, and then people 
[03:42:00]  with Windows calling me retarded, that I didn't know how to install it.  It installed fun on my machine, asshole.  You must be running a 486.  You fuck it.  So, you know, you got to take the good criticism with the bad with these films.  I'm sure you know the same thing.  The facts of life.  People like your stuff.  Some people don't.  Some really don't.  This was nominated for an Emmy, though.  Yeah.  Really.  Dick in a Box was nominated for an Emmy.  How the fuck did that happen?  I know.  Do you see the golden glow coming off me? 
[03:42:30]  Yes.  Norminated.  Wow.  You know, you got to be happy just to be nominated.  Absolutely.  Because if you fucking win, there's got to be a problem somewhere in this system.  But Hot Rod, I mean, let's not forget it.  It was Friday.  Rob was raising his hand like he has some kind of trick up his sleeve.  I think I'm going to try to do a mousetrap teabag.  I'm going to try to drop the whole thing inside into the mousetraps.  Wow.  Like two at once.  Yes.  These guys still have mousetraps hanging off their sack. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no, like, okay, the bit's over.  It's like, Matt's got two hanging out of his pants.  He's got a little.  Yeah, you got a little too much hanging out there.  Jesus.  That is just not right.  All right.  All right.  Here he goes.  He's setting up the mousetraps.  He's going to teabag it.  He's going to teabag the mousetraps.  This is, uh.  He's going to teabag it.  I like that we have double legs.  This works.  All right.  All right.  And.  No, don't do this.  Don't do this.  Here you go.  Oh, my God. 
[03:43:30]  Wow.  Oh, any teabag.  We are back on track.  That was impressive, Rob.  Wow.  And it's still on there.  Yeah, it is.  It hit ball.  Yeah.  That thing is on part of the ball.  All right.  Matt, you got some competition today, bro.  Had to be painful.  Yeah.  And that still hurts.  And I think I found a fresh patch of Icy Hot when I did that, too.  What other interviews have you done, Andy?  All the big ones, I'm sure.  Yeah, some very good ones. 
[03:44:00]  I'm doing Regis this week.  Yeah, you know.  Regis.  I'm sure Regis will have a bit like this for you.  I bet there will be way less balls.  I'm predicting less balls.  Well, I'm sorry.  We have ball bags today.  People lowering their testicles into balls.  They're balls.  So, Andy.  Right in the mousetrap.  Tell us about your movie.  Yeah, this is a lot more sack than I was anticipating when I woke up this morning.  But you know what?  Welcome.  Welcome to it.  Yeah.  We need to get a winner here.  What are we going to do there?  Yeah, what the hell are we going to do?  Any other ideas, Matt? 
[03:44:30]  We can glob the rest of the Icy Hot on the trap and dump everything right down to it.  Rob's like saying, so what?  Yeah.  He said, who gives a shit?  How about some hot rod trivia?  It has nothing to do with putting your scrotum in anything.  Just pick a number between 1 and 10.  Yeah.  The floor looks like when you ever visit like an accident or crime scene the next day  and all the AMT people's garbage is all over the place.  That's what it looks like. 
[03:45:00]  You think this is going to work or?  Oh.  Ah, the Icy Hot set off the mousetrap.  See.  You can reset it.  How about you rub Icy Hot in your eyeballs?  Yeah, why don't we just, could you stab yourself in the chest and put Icy Hot in the hole?  Can we just admit this isn't working and somehow pick a...  Oh, that's a lot of Icy Hot on one's own balls.  All right, this is a problem. 
[03:45:30]  It looks like a dollop of cream fresh.  Yes, it does.  Yes.  All right, well...  Mmm, delicious.  I think you have enough icing on that ball bag there.  Ah, Hot Rod.  Come on, Friday.  It's getting close to barf time.  Oh, you lost your dollop.  First major motion picture.  Oh, my God.  First major motion picture.  Yes.  Right?  First major motion picture.  Are you nervous?  A little nervous?  Um, not so much, to be honest.  Did you see it already? 
[03:46:00]  A lot of people, sometimes they don't see it until it actually is out.  No, I've seen it a lot, a lot, a lot.  Yeah.  Me and my two buddies, Akiva and Yorma, we sort of did it together and we oversaw the editing.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Because Akiva directed it.  Does that suck, though?  Because, like, something that's really...  I know, because editing stuff, sometimes you run through it and you go, was that ever funny?  Oh, yeah.  Like, you start second guessing.  Yeah.  It's hysterical at first and it winds up being hysterical in the movie or whatever you're  putting together.  But if you're editing it, it's like...  No, you go... 
[03:46:30]  Ten times.  Absolutely nuts.  But we, you know, you go doing test screenings and stuff so you actually see the audience  react.  Makes you feel better.  And you're like, oh, right, it was funny.  Yeah, that didn't suck.  Ah, back to...  All right.  Ball back.  I'm just trying to conduct a little interview in between snapping balls in Mousetrap.  And I don't want to impose myself on something.  Oh.  Feel free.  Clearly the movie is promoting itself here.  Yes.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That hurt a little bit, right? 
[03:47:00]  Huh?  Yeah, he got some of the...  The ball.  Yeah.  Don't you understand?  That was so genuine.  Yeah.  The ball.  The ball.  The ball.  He's ready to go down.  Oh, God.  So what got you interested in making films?  Making these short films.  Oh, you know, ever since I was a kid, I was into comedy.  And, you know, the opportunity arose.  And I said, strike while the iron's hot. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you always run around on a camcorder trying to come up with ideas?  Yeah, I did.  Getting your friends together and making dopey videos and stuff?  Absolutely, yeah.  We all did.  That's fun.  It's like you have a bunch of funny, cool friends.  What's your favorite comedy of all time?  God, I don't know if I have just one.  I love The Jerk.  Yeah.  I'm a huge Billy Madison fan.  Mm-hmm.  Tommy Boy.  Caddyshack is huge for me.  Anything by Mel Brooks, to be honest. 
[03:48:00]  I love.  I was into Monty Python.  I was that kid.  Yeah.  It was good because he occasionally saw it like tit.  It's Channel 13, like public television.  You're like, oh, tit.  Dude, British boobie.  British boobies.  Don't they have a problem with that?  Apparently not.  Nothing quite like it.  All right, back to these guys.  Yes, yes, back to the running out of ideas.  I don't know how well it's going to work.  I was going to try to do the taint area and try to squeeze something under there. 
[03:48:30]  I don't know what I'll get out of it, though.  It's not a very skin-heavy idea.  It's kind of thick skin in there, isn't it?  You're going to have to really pull that down.  Jared, do you want to help him?  Someone is suggesting the first ever flaming mousetrap.  I don't think so.  I think being fired, smoke detectors might go off.  We can't have people cooking flaming mousetrap.  We can't have an open flame for cooking, never mind snapping balls in a... 
[03:49:00]  Flaming mousetrap.  This whole segment is about as flaming as we can get, to tell you the truth.  There's nothing to grab.  Sorry, he can't put his taint in there.  His taint's too taut.  Yes, everyone's taint is pretty taut.  Getting a lot of questions for Andy.  How was it like making out with Borat's chick?  How was it like?  Yeah.  How was it like?  Like a dream.  That's what he's supposed to say.  It's great, man.  It sucked shit, Ben Pratt.  It was the worst. 
[03:49:30]  You know, to be honest, it was my first movie kissing, and I was a little nervous about it,  and then you realize it's like...  Did you slip tongue in and make...  There was nothing.  Very technical.  Did you slip tongue in and have the director go, hey, what's up, dude?  And you're like, I'm a newbie.  I didn't know.  I know, but I'm not big on tongue.  No?  No.  No.  No.  Just...  Not at first.  You like doing the fifth or sixth grade boy-girl kiss.  Yeah, I'm into that.  You just put your lips together and move your head back and forth.  Exactly, but then straight into butt sex.  Okay.  You're just like skipping over everything. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Your foreplay...  It's like every Skinamax movie.  It starts off with a little making out.  Then the girl goes down, and it's always straight into dog's neck.  You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, they missed a few steps there.  What happened?  What did I miss?  I'm really slow at sex.  It's honestly like movies made for 13-year-old boys.  You know what I'd love to see.  Right.  To the point.  One film I saw, I'm sure it was one of yours. 
[03:50:30]  Was it yours?  The Sam Peckinpah-ish, where everyone walks in and gets shot.  Oh, yeah.  The shooter.  That was very well done and very funny.  Thank you very much, sir.  I think that's one of my favorite ones you've done as of yet.  Everyone that walks in the door is shot by the previous person that got shot.  We did that one with Shia.  Yeah.  I don't know if you guys are familiar with the little ditty name, Transformers.  Yeah.  Blockbuster, excuse me.  Half so smurfly.  Short thing. 
[03:51:00]  All right.  Someone's suggesting a staple or a thumbtack in the mousetrap.  Can we suggest a time card in the mousetrap or something?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  This isn't working.  Obviously, it's not working.  How about we tase the balls?  Tase?  Do you guys have a taser?  I wish we did.  What do you got, Sam?  What does Sam have a taser?  Eric's over there holding a baseball bat.  Oh, a baseball bat to the ball.  What the fuck?  Are you going to Al Capone the guy in the nuts?  Come on. 
[03:51:30]  Imagine Andy finally has to tap out.  Whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  I got to leave.  What the fuck?  My publicist is calling.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know there was going to be a bloodshed.  Destroying my budding career.  He's going to start a war.  Yeah.  Cross the bridge.  Wait, you.  Someone is reminding us that you made out with Scarlett Johansson on SNL.  I wouldn't call it Make It Out.  No?  We were dressed up like gross Total Recall Quatto aliens in someone's stomach, and we like  sort of licked each other's tongues.  It was pretty much the worst circumstance to make out with Scarlett, I'd say. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  But pretty cool.  I don't see if there is a worse circumstance.  You know, it's that old pizza joke.  Did I mention that everyone in the scene then starts violently vomiting everywhere?  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  So I guess the auntie just got upped.  Hot Rod.  Hot Rod, our third.  That's this Friday.  Yes.  This Friday.  Andy Sandler.  Hot Rod.  Stunt man that does bad stunts.  It's a real movie in the theaters.  Is there going to be a serious message by the end of it?  Absolutely.  Do people call you Adam Sandler?  People call me Adam Sandberg all the time. 
[03:52:30]  Do they?  If you Google Adam Sandberg, I think there's half as many things as my actual name.  Oh, how annoying.  It happened to be before SNL, though.  I used to do a bunch of stand-up, and I would always get introduced that way.  Oh.  Adam Sandberg.  And I'd be like, no.  It's Andy.  Oh my God, it's Andy.  Yep.  Andy, you douche.  It's not that bad, though, because Sandler's kind of my hero.  Is he?  You meet him?  You know him?  Yeah, we've met.  He's a fucking super nice guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did he show you the ropes, kind of like, hey, kid, let me tell you what it's like?  A little bit.  Yeah.  He was just more just like, congrats, and have fun with it, kind of. 
[03:53:00]  Does his new movie poster just annoy you, though?  I kind of like it.  I'm not talking about the movie.  I'm not talking about Adam.  I'm not talking about Kevin.  We know you're not going to trash him.  We're just talking about the poster.  It's Kevin James holding Adam Sandler, and Kevin's wearing a tuxedo, because they're  getting married, but they're straight, and he's yelling, and he's got the fire helmet  on, and Adam Sandler's got a, oh, I'm going through this phase, and every time I go through 
[03:53:30]  the tunnel here in New York, I look at it, and I stop, and I step on the brake, and I  turn my head, and I go, I fucking hate that poster, but I can't look away.  And I brought up a circumstance where you go into a video store, and you just look at  video covers, and I can't stop looking, but I hate the cover.  Like, what was the one I was thinking of with, um...  What?  Yeah.  What is it?  I Love Trouble.  I Love Trouble.  What's that movie?  It's just an awful cover.  I don't even know who's in it anymore. 
[03:54:00]  It's horrible.  Huh?  Who's in it, Jared?  Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte?  Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts, and they're both looking kind of like...  And you can tell it's kind of picture-painted.  Right.  And they're both looking like, hey, hey, I Love Trouble.  And I hate it.  I hate the covers.  All right, back to the balls.  All right.  Just, I don't know why I feel compelled to tell you these things.  I'm totally comfortable hearing about it.  But it was the Adam Sandler thing that I was getting into, and it's nothing to get  back at Adam, but I don't like that poster. 
[03:54:30]  Rob's trying to...  I don't...  Honestly, I don't...  Not many movie posters are kind of cool to look at.  Movies can be good, but the posters kind of...  Have you seen the High Road one?  What do you think?  I think it's great.  It's kind of kick-ass.  See, that one is good.  It's like a lunchbox.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you guys saw the Underoos, the t-shirt with that thing on it.  Yeah.  Well, we saw...  Yeah, Jared is modeling them.  Jared, get back up.  Jared, if you get up...  There it is.  There you go.  Look at that.  Did you ever think you'd see your movie on a guy's ass that is shaped like a bowl of  mashed potatoes?  I'd always hoped. 
[03:55:00]  He's not old enough to have a body like that.  It takes years to cultivate.  I like to think they're not just mashed potatoes, though.  I mean, those are like wasabi mash or like garlic mash.  Not garlic mash.  Yeah, something classy.  I love garlic mash.  Rob's got something.  Rob?  Oh, Rob?  Speaking of Jared, I thought that we could turn this into a talent contest.  I could do an upside down pole slide.  And as a solace for blowing on my cock, he could hit me with the mousetrap on the way 
[03:55:30]  once I've gotten down as I'm holding on to the pole.  So you go on the pole inverted.  Inverted.  As you slide down, legs akimbo, sack exposed.  He snaps the trap on your bag.  Indeed.  No.  Well, if...  That's going to end with a broken neck.  Or you could just do it right side up and just have the trap waiting at the bottom.  I don't...  Might be...  One in a million shots.  One in a million shots.  See, Matt's already telling everyone your idea sucks there.  Yeah.  We need something to end this. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  Please.  I like a one in a million shots.  It's like the plot of Armageddon.  It's just crazy enough to work.  Right.  People still saw Armageddon.  It's just not going to work.  We need to get some oil drillers in here to properly damage his sack.  Yeah.  It's a one in a million shot.  All right.  We got to wrap this exciting contest up.  All for Andy.  Yeah.  By the way, I really appreciate it.  This was all for you, Andy.  Thank you very much, guys. 
[03:56:30]  He wants it to end so badly just so we can leave.  That is far from the case.  Oh, okay.  I want to leave it because I'm gagging on the icy hot smell.  It is really.  But you know something?  You are going to be limber tomorrow.  Not one must.  You're going to be, wow, you know, my shoulder hurt yesterday, but today, fine.  Anything, any ideas to just give the frigging prize away?  I love the flaming mousetrap idea.  We can't set fires in the studio.  Why?  We will be fired.  I like that idea. 
[03:57:00]  Again.  Yeah, I know.  He keeps thinking of it.  Flaming mousetrap.  We can't do the flaming mousetrap.  No?  Dopey and Opie and Dopey fired again.  I can't take the headlines.  We could put broken glass in the mousetrap.  Oh, I like it.  Broken glass could be good.  Sorry.  I looked at me like, what?  I got a fucking suggestion.  Jesus Christ.  They're way past the pain, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  The problem is-  It's not hurting anymore.  Well, no, also, they will one-up each other.  Yeah, they have no problem doing the same thing that the guy just did before.  They're going to succeed at whatever they do. 
[03:57:30]  So, why don't we have a contest that has something to do with Jared?  Okay.  Something to do with, uh, Jared, can we-  It's going to be some sort of time thing.  That way, there are going to be no ties.  There we go.  Oh, wait.  Jack has got an idea.  Jack.  Jack.  Help us end this.  The mousetrap on Jared's head, and then they teabag the mousetrap while he's squatting down  the position.  I love that.  But they'll all do it.  They can position the mousetraps on various parts of his body, and then teabag. 
[03:58:00]  This is just, like, guy shit.  Like, you sat around in two long smoking pot, and then you just come up with these dumb things.  Dude.  I think-  I see what we do.  Uh, no.  Someone is just suggesting we split the 500.  That's boring.  What do you got, Rob?  I'll come up with three 500s, and we'll call it.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  500.  How about-  Well, we got two right here we can give you.  There you go.  That's Jared's.  Yeah.  He got it for making pubic hair, beard, mustache before. 
[03:58:30]  Congratulations.  I can't believe we have to explain this to a big movie star.  Hot Rod.  Oh, you're far overshooting my status.  I-  How about the first person who can put three on and have them stay on?  Just in order-  I have three on right now.  What?  Yeah.  Matt's had three on for, like, an hour.  Whoever can do it the quickest.  The quickest.  The quickest.  Very good.  All right.  I was thinking closest to Jared contest thing.  What?  To which part of it?  It's got to be timed.  I don't know.  I'm keeping it very general right now. 
[03:59:00]  I think this has to be timed.  How about some, like, agility competition?  Agility.  See, Rob's saying yeah.  Oh, I don't think so.  So, we do, like, a three-way 69 with these three guys, right?  All righty.  And whoever can hold off the longest.  By the way, it's called a daisy chain.  Oh, sorry.  I'm not up to date.  But I'm saying, like, everyone's really worked up, so somebody's going to-  Yeah, someone's got to shoot fast. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  It's palpable in here.  Yes.  We're all going to make page six.  Why don't we, uh-  Hmm.  How about we have him drink water for a wee?  Most I could-  No?  I was hoping one of them would die.  Just please.  Can we get done with this?  My God.  Do we have a meeting today?  Yeah, I guess.  Fuck!  No!  We're in a quandary here.  Jared, can we do some kind of teabagging contest with you? 
[04:00:00]  What is-  But they'll all do it.  Yeah, but the closest without touching them wins or something.  You touch, you lose.  They'll all touch them.  They'll all touch me, and it'll be gross.  No, but if they touch, they're out.  Oh, okay.  So the last guy's got the advantage.  Right.  All right, what are they whispering?  You've got to flip a coin.  We split it.  We all have to go shopping right now because it's on a gift card together.  Ew.  Do you think we care what you're doing?  All right.  Closest one to his nose without touching wins. 
[04:00:30]  What?  What?  You're doing teabag.  Closest to his nose without touching wins.  You have to squat down.  You have to squat down.  The second you touch his nose, you are out.  All right, who's going to be the official measurer?  Measurer.  Come on, Jared.  You need a spark plug gapping tool for this one.  We've got a big movie star.  Oh, by the way, Andy.  Yeah.  He wants you to autograph his underpants.  No problem.  Wilders.  Dang, that's huge, right?  See?  Come on.  Jared's a huge fan. 
[04:01:00]  Wild, the dudes are putting their balls on your face?  There's a moment to remember.  Yeah, right.  All right, here comes Jared.  Let's not forget Hot Rod in movies this Friday.  Movie theaters this Friday.  Movie cineplexes.  Country-wide.  All right, Jared, lay on your back.  The movie house.  Yeah.  The movie house cineplex.  So this is happening.  They are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is not going to be good.  What?  Why do you have such a dark patch of skin here? 
[04:01:30]  It's this t-shirt tan.  It's never seen the sun.  Ringworm.  I've seen it quite like that.  But it's a nice case.  I mean, it's like really nicely developed.  All right, Jared, get on your back.  All right.  Now the pal talkers can't see.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  What's going to happen here?  Pal talk people.  You got to like kind of straddle his face area.  And if you touch me, I'm hitting you.  And no, no.  Then tie up his hands. 
[04:02:00]  That'll show him.  But let's tie up his hands if he's going to hit.  None of these guys want to hit your face.  They want the $500.  Now, this might be a little late in the game to clarify this, but this is not Jared from  Subway, right?  No.  Oh, no.  It's not.  Okay.  Oh, I never thought a lot of people might confuse that.  All right, and move the camera to the left.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a director, too.  I direct pal talk.  Oh, fantastic.  Yeah.  Cameraman, everything.  All right.  That's beautiful.  Go up in the air a little bit.  There we go. 
[04:02:30]  The one spot in the whole studio.  There you go.  And it's right at Andy's feet.  Lucky.  I know.  I want to apologize.  You know, if that chair has wheels on it, feel free to just scoot as far away from any  photographs or anything you want.  I apologize.  I thought we were, you know, helping him out here.  What?  He doesn't want to be.  Oh.  All right.  Who's first?  I don't want to be here, and it's our stupid show.  Iraq, why are you yawning?  You're bored, too?  He wants to be.  All right.  In on it.  All right.  All right.  Who's going to be the official judge to see how close they get to his nose without touching 
[04:03:00]  it?  Sam.  Since the last person has the advantage, how are we going to tell who goes first?  Rush Jaws.  I think my reputation supersedes.  What?  Your reputation doesn't do shit.  What's a reputation?  It supersedes itself.  It supersedes itself.  That's great.  I don't know what you mean.  Old Menino mouth.  All right.  Do a eeny, meeny, miny, fucking pick something. 
[04:03:30]  Do a rock, paper, scissors.  Well, that doesn't work with three.  Well, yeah.  You're around.  Yeah.  There you go.  Jared, you got to sit on your hands.  All right.  Dan goes first.  No, no.  He'll be the last guy.  Oh, Dan's last?  Last guy's the advantage.  That way, we don't have to do it twice.  Okay.  You guys fight it out amongst yourselves.  And then you guys do shoot it out real quick.  Let's not say shoot it out.  One, two, three.  Wait, one, two, three, shoot?  Yeah, one, two, three, shoot.  Let's draw this out, please.  One, two, three, shoot.  Fuck.  All right.  So, goes Matt, Rob, Dan. 
[04:04:00]  Yay.  Jared, close your eyes.  You're not going to want to see this.  All right.  So, why?  It's the ball bag closer to the nose without hitting it.  You know, if you guys just would have said you were burning from the icy hot hours ago,  this would be over.  No touch.  Wait, where's my ball bag?  See.  Where's my hair?  I hope we don't have a photo finish here.  Oh, my God.  This is so fucking good.  What?  I mean, there's already...  Do hairs count?  Wait, Jared, why are you moving? 
[04:04:30]  Because his hair has hit me, so it counts.  That doesn't count.  Yeah, it does.  No, we've got to clarify this.  The rules were not very well established.  They really weren't.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the ruling on hair?  Matt has, like, seven-inch ball hairs, too, so he's not going to be able to get very close.  What?  Hair can't count.  Hair can't count.  Hair doesn't count.  Hair doesn't count.  So, Jared's just going to get ball hair all over his nose.  You've got to get ball hair on your nose.  You've got to...  Again. 
[04:05:00]  All right, here we go.  He's squatting down closest without...  I apologize, Andy.  This is...  That's okay.  I want to take this opportunity to say hi to my mom.  Yeah.  I've had many proud moments like that with this program.  All the Samberg family out there listening.  Yeah.  As I'm watching a dude get his ball sack dangerously close to another man's face.  Sam, how close?  Extremely close.  Extremely close.  I'm extreme.  Okay.  This Friday.  All right.  Absolutely.  Thank you again.  So, going first might be an advantage, because now he's going to have to get closer, and  he might touch ball bag.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go, Rob. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, Sam.  You'll have to let him know if he's close enough.  That was fucking shit.  Oh, gosh.  This is the worst.  It's the best.  The Paltok people are, um, hot rod Friday.  That's fucking gross.  Nothing, right?  No move.  No, not close.  Thank you.  I can't believe that didn't touch.  Rob, you're not close enough.  You're getting a little closer.  He's got to get close enough.  Oh, what is it?  You can't coach him.  You got it.  You got it.  Wow.  Wow.  All right. 
[04:06:00]  He's in.  Wait, Rob's got, all right.  Rob's got closest.  Rob's tautness once again came in handy.  Yeah.  Does Matt get a chance to beat that?  That's cool.  No.  Everything about Rob is very tight.  All judges.  His skin is tightly wound.  That helped out.  All judges' decisions are final.  He actually got the nose within, like, a ball sack ridge.  Wow.  Right in there.  So it was almost like surface tension of ball.  It was like the ball dropped into that alleyway to blow up the Death Star.  Right.  Yes.  All right.  Here we go. 
[04:06:30]  All right.  Yeah.  This is gay.  Oh.  Wow.  You're dropping out.  Oh, my God.  This is gay.  This is gay?  All right.  Let Matt at least try to.  What?  Wait.  Where have you been for the past two hours?  Here we go.  Sit down.  All right.  Matt's going to attempt to beat Rob.  Is that?  I applaud Dan today, by the way.  Only took an hour and a half for someone to realize this is really gay.  It's not the gayness.  It's pretty disgusting.  All right.  Here he goes.  I like to think it's a combination of both. 
[04:07:00]  I think it's a touch there.  Look at that.  Oh, I think he touched.  No.  I think he touched.  Oh, he does not have to touch.  Jared's like, that was a touch.  Jared.  Jared.  Jared's a touch.  All right.  That was a touch.  Wow.  All right.  It's like a disgusting version of Operation.  Take out wrenched ankle.  All right.  Touch bag on nose.  All right.  Go take off your hot rod underpants there, Jared.  All right.  Rob's our big winner.  Rob's the big winner for the $500. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  But is anyone really a winner here?  Well, no.  I like to think we're all losers.  Yeah.  I think we've all lost something of ourselves.  All right.  So hot rod is in movie theaters on Friday.  Anything else you want to say about the movie there?  Andy?  It's kick ass.  I actually stand by it.  I think it's super funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to go check it out.  We're all going to check it out.  Yep.  Absolutely.  I just want to apologize for having to come in here under these circumstances and plug your  movie like this.  I don't think there's any apologies in order here.  I think this was a delightful time had by all. 
[04:08:00]  I think at some point you'll probably just be walking down the street and go, what the  fuck was that?  In the twilight of my years.  Yeah.  You'd just be like, what the?  Maybe that day when those dudes were throwing their sacks around in the master house.  What the fuck is that all about?  The radio is stupid.  We try to make a really good first impression so you don't forget about it.  And this ball sack thing is like the head and shoulders of radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right. 
[04:08:30]  We actually do really good radio.  Yeah.  And you've been doing it all day.  Thank you.  Well, some might think.  Thank you.  And I'm not one of those people that think.  You're welcome back any time.  I would love to.  This doesn't go on every day.  Well, I got to warn you that.  Yeah.  I mean, the bar has been set now.  Yeah.  If I come back, I better walk in and see dudes just butt fucked.  Oh, shit.  Andy's coming back.  Layed out on the couch.  He's got to beat his last appearance. 
[04:09:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, sorry.  That's happening.  There it is.  Don't mind, though.  Anyways.  The movie is Hot Rod on DVD.  Yep.  Everyone go see Hot Rod.  This Friday.  Woo!  And our new friend, Andy Sandberg.  I hope you come back, Andy.  Thanks, guys.  I will.  We really are huge fans of what you're doing.  Thank you, Supermucho.  Huge, huge.  Could we get out of here?  All right.  We're going to play the Emmy-nominated Dick in a Box and end the show.  Yes.  Let it rain.  The unedited version, by the way.  Nice. 
[04:09:30]  Satellite radio.  We'll do whatever we want.  Obviously.  Oh, did we tell you this is FM?  All right, Andy.  It's a pleasure.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Check this out.  Oh, well, that...  Hey, girl.  I got something real important to give you.  So just sit down and listen.  Girl, you know we've been together such a long, long time.  Such a long time.  And now I'm ready to lay it on the line. 
[04:10:00]  Well, you know it's Christmas and my heart is open.  Why?  I'm going to give you something so you know what's on my mind.  A gift for your special city of the town.  Take a look inside.  It's my dick in a box.  It's a box.  I'm not going to get you a diamond ring. 
[04:10:30]  That sort of gift don't mean anything.  I'm not going to get you a fancy car.  Girl, you got to know you're my shining star.  I'm not going to get you a house in the hills.  A girl like you needs something real.  I'm going to get you something from the heart.  Something special, girl.  It's my dick in a box.  My dick in a box, girl.  It's my dick in a box. 
[04:11:00]  My dick in a box, girl.  See, I'm wise enough to know when a gift me's given.  And I got just the one.  Something to show you that you are second enough.  To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress.  It's easy to do.  Just follow these steps.  One.  Cut a hole in a box.  Put your junk in that box.  Make a open the box. 
[04:11:30]  And that's the way you do it.  It's my dick in a box.  My dick in a box, girl.  It's my dick in a box.  My dick in a box, girl.  Christmas.  Dick in a box.  Dick in a box.  Yes.  A dick in a box.  Every single holiday, a dick in a box.  Over at your parents' house, a dick in a box. 
[04:12:00]  Me and Dad at the grocery store, a dick in a box.  Backstage at the CMA's, a dick in a box.  Yeah, well, well, well, well.  A dick in a box.  A dick in a box.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. </pre>
