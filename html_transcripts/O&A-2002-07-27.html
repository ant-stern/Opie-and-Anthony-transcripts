<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a dramatic recounting of a feud between Opie and Al Dukes, a producer from the competing Ron and Fez show.  Dukes, seemingly infatuated with Opie, gifted him an unwanted $3,000 pinball machine, further escalating the tension after damaging Opie's foosball table.  Dukes’ emotional response to Opie's rejection, including a self-composed parody song, was discussed at length, with Ron and Fez (who were guests in the studio later in the show) also expressing embarrassment over Dukes' behavior.  The segment culminated in Opie, with the consent of Fez and Ron, destroying the pinball machine with a sledgehammer in front of Dukes.  Following this, a comedic bit mocking a letter from a cancer patient to Celine Dion (as seen on Oprah) ensued, with Anthony’s extensive Celine Dion impersonation and crude jokes about the *Titanic* and his own anatomy.

Next, comedian Rich Voss joined the show as a guest.  The conversation quickly turned vulgar, focusing on Voss’s career, his self-described womanizing, and graphic sexual anecdotes, many fabricated for comedic effect.  The hosts criticized Voss’s stand-up abilities and engaged in increasingly offensive and sexually suggestive banter. A listener contest about how Voss “made history” was revealed to be about his financing of an old Mercedes-Benz purchase.  Voss’s appearance on *Def Comedy Jam* as the first white comedian was discussed with sexually charged comments and accompanying clips.

A significant portion of the show then focused on Psycho Mark's gay roommate, with the hosts sharing exaggerated and offensive descriptions of his lifestyle and behaviors, eliciting further offensive jokes from both the hosts and callers.  The hosts also discussed a *New York Magazine* article about the show,  using the article's mentions of a stripper and an amputee woman appearing in the studio as further fodder for crude jokes and commentary.  The segment concluded with more offensive jokes and interactions with callers.

A caller named Sandy described her boyfriend's habit of masturbating while she slept, using a pillow as a screen.  This, along with the in-studio presence of Adam Ferrara, prompted further humorous exaggeration and ribbing from the hosts and guest.  Another caller, Rick, detailed his past relationship with a woman whose fetish for watching him overeat led to him gaining over 800 pounds. He discussed the abusive aspects of the relationship, including physical aggression when he didn't eat enough, and provided his website address for listeners to see pictures.  The segment also included interactions with other callers and studio guests Jim Brewer and his mother, whose in-studio appearance included anecdotes about their own past drunken escapades and family life. Adam Ferrara's upcoming stand-up shows were also promoted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and strange.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny. 
[00:00:30]  Dan, what's up?  Good afternoon, Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Hello.  Opie, how are you doing this afternoon?  I'm doing good.  You know, after last night's complete mental breakdown that you had on the phone,  where I thought you were going to just completely lose it and drive into an emboldened.  Well, I'm being stalked by a...  by a fag, basically. 
[00:01:00]  And I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Al Dukes, it seems, has something for Opie, and I don't know what it is.  I'm a kook magnet, I swear to God.  I have more kooks that follow me around than I care to think about.  And one of them works for Ron and Fez, the show that's on after us here in New York.  He's their producer.  Well, that's what they call him.  I don't know what he produces.  It's a cute little title.  So, it's a known fact for everyone in the New York area that I just despise this guy. 
[00:01:30]  I don't like him.  It's no radio bit.  Anthony will vouch for me.  I haven't said hi to him in...  I don't think I've ever said hi to him officially.  No, I don't think so.  He's very upset about this.  He's trying to win your love and buy your love now with things like $3,000 pinball machines.  And what put it over the edge was when Ron and Fez had him kiss a guy, and then he made believe it wasn't a guy, I guess, or something.  He got all drunk, and somehow he ended up kissing a man on Ron and Fez's show. 
[00:02:00]  He got so upset about this that he went outside and tipped over my foosball table I brought in and broke it.  He was acting like an 11-year-old girl.  And that put it over the top for me.  I'm like, you know, I don't have time for anyone like that.  You know what he was?  He was acting...  Destroyed, you know, personal property of yours.  Yeah.  He was acting like a straight guy that can't accept the fact that he's gay and, like, has his gay experience and freaks out. 
[00:02:30]  He kissed that guy and lost his mind.  He started flipping over my foosball table, broke it.  So I was like, you're going to replace that goddamn thing.  That's one of the many soap operas that is the Opie and Anthony show.  So he finally replaced it after I had to threaten giving out his phone number on the air.  That's pretty much what it was.  You'd have been able to call Al Dukes at his home at 2, 3, 4 in the morning.  Right.  Whatever time you're damn well pleased. 
[00:03:00]  You know that phone would have rang 24 hours a day.  And he finally came to and got the foosball table.  Well, he got the wrong one at first, then he got the right one.  Yeah, then he got the right one.  So then everything went back to normal and Ant decided he would at least acknowledge him.  And that's fine.  If he walks by in the hall, I go, how you doing?  Yeah.  That's about all you...  How you doing?  You'll give him, right?  Yeah.  I just don't want to talk to the guy.  Not going to be taking warm showers together.  And I know I look like a complete A because I've read the email today.  I know.  But I don't like the guy.  Right.  You come across people in your life that you just don't like. 
[00:03:30]  And I said it on the air with Ron and Fez last night.  I honestly couldn't tell you why I don't like him.  I just know I don't.  Right.  And I have no time for him and I don't want to be bothered by him.  Okay?  And I also told him that I wouldn't punch him in the face and, you know, just leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.  He doesn't like the fact that, you know, we'll be walking down the hall and it'll be just me and him, you know, walking toward each other.  Ah, I heard this.  And then it's very uncomfortable.  Not for me.  I love that.  Yeah.  But I guess it's really uncomfortable for him because he knows I'm not even going to make eye contact. 
[00:04:00]  You're the only people in the hall.  Nothing.  I do make eye contact out of the side of my eye, though, and I see him awkwardly trying to nod and stuff.  And then the look on his face when he realizes that I haven't even acknowledged him.  Oh, I know.  He hates that.  And I know I'm an a-hole for doing this stuff and you can write as much as you want, but I just love stuff like this.  But I said, look, you know, it's a little uncomfortable, but just stay out of my way.  That's it. 
[00:04:30]  I'm not going to even cause a scene in the halls or anything.  Just leave me alone.  So I guess everything kind of went back to normal.  Uh-huh.  And we get back from Christmas break, and yesterday, Ben's telling me that he bought me a present.  A present.  Anthony, how long have you and I known each other?  Oh, my God.  About eight years now, I believe.  Eight years.  Eight years, yeah.  I think one Christmas.  I've got to remember.  The first one, I think.  One Christmas, I think we bought each other something.  And it was something stupid like a computer game you wanted. 
[00:05:00]  And I think you bought me like a Nirvana CD or something.  Yeah, it was ridiculous, some kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right?  Is that about it?  That's pretty much it.  And with all the success we've had in recent years, you would think maybe...  We've cut each other off.  Yeah, you'd think maybe we would have done something for each other.  But no, we're just pals and friends.  But we don't need to buy each other things, right?  I know if you want something, you'll buy it.  If I want something, I buy it for myself.  What the hell am I going to get you?  So I go to Ben yesterday.  So what the hell did this idiot buy me?  He goes, a $3,000 pinball machine? 
[00:05:30]  Now you're thinking he wants to make the piece or something.  He's going to buy you maybe a bottle of wine.  If he hears the show, he knows he likes the wine a little bit.  Maybe a bottle of wine or something.  Maybe, yeah, a video game or something.  I don't do well when people buy me presents.  I think you know that by now if you've been listening to this show.  But I mean, that would even be well over, above and beyond the situation at hand.  Right.  A $3,000 classic Rolling Stones pinball machine. 
[00:06:00]  Which, by the way, is already broken.  Of which they only made how many?  A thousand, I think.  A thousand, yeah.  Well, the thing's already broken according to Ben.  So I said I wasn't going to...  What?  What?  Rick just said a $3,000 pinball machine is a gay engagement ring.  That's the equivalent of a gay engagement ring.  You didn't accept it, dude.  Oh, yes.  Al Dukes.  Am I married now?  Jesus Christ.  In some countries.  No, it's good you didn't accept it, dude.  Oh, all right. 
[00:06:30]  So I said I'm not playing the thing.  And then I guess Ron and Fez started...  Can we get Ron or Fez on the phone?  Maybe.  If they're around.  They listen to the show.  They'll call in.  So I told...  You know, they went on their show to talk about the whole thing.  Yeah.  And what Al was thinking.  Because now Ron and Fez are embarrassed.  Because, you know, we really get along with Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  But there's this thing between us.  His name is Al Dukes.  Al Dukes.  All I heard was Ronnie last night going,  Ah, this is embarrassing, Fez. 
[00:07:00]  Ah, this is so embarrassing.  I hope he's on the phone again.  Ah, this is embarrassing.  This is what I did.  So we got off the air yesterday.  And I'm driving to the Coliseum for the Islanders game last night.  And I hear Ron and Fez talking to Al about it.  And he's crying like a little girl because I haven't accepted his gift.  Yeah, you didn't go up.  I guess he probably had it all planned out in his head.  He's going to present this $3,000 pinball machine.  You're going to go, Ah, Al, you know, put your hand out.  Nice, firm handshake. 
[00:07:30]  Al, thanks, man.  Hey, anything that happened in the past, you know, I really appreciate this pinball machine.  And thank you so much.  And, you know, I just want to be able to call you a friend now.  Probably what he played out in his head.  But now it's even more embarrassing.  It's even more uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, why does this guy care this much about, you know, me?  Mm-hmm.  You know?  He could have a career without me.  He could work here without me.  No, he needs your acceptance, your approval, and, dare I say, your love. 
[00:08:00]  So I was on the air on the way to the game with Ron and Fez the whole ride to the Coliseum.  Yeah.  And Al's trying to talk to me, and I'm like, no.  You can talk to Ron, and Ron will tell me what you're saying.  Ron's the go-between.  I was acting like I was in third grade.  The listener hated that man the email.  What a toolhole if you heard ask.  Don't talk to me.  And so then I have to turn off the show because I'm going into the game. 
[00:08:30]  And game's over.  Islanders win.  I come out to my car.  I listen to Ron and Fez when I'm, you know, tooling around town.  Mm-hmm.  And all of a sudden, I swear, as I turn on the radio, I hear Al Duke singing a song to me.  Wait, stop it.  Do we have a copy of the...  Stop it.  Do we have a copy of the Painted Black song he was singing last night?  No.  Dude, stop it.  Where is that?  I swear to you, I have not heard this.  You didn't hear it?  I got to hear it, though, now. 
[00:09:00]  So now he's singing, like, a stupid parody song about the whole incident, right?  So then Sandy, my girlfriend, calls in.  Like, look, man, he's got enough stalkers in his life.  I have to deal with Stalker Patty, which is the guy's eyes, dude.  I got to deal with some wacko from Chicago that decides to call us in the middle of the night.  Enough.  Enough.  I don't need another Stalker around, right?  So then he goes, and this is what really freaked me out.  He goes, so what is Opie like off the air?  Ooh. 
[00:09:30]  Wants to get to know you a little more.  And I'm listening to this while I'm driving.  So he's asking Sandy what I'm like off the air.  He needs to know more personal information.  He wants to know.  That really...  No joke, dude.  That really freaked me out.  And now I will have nothing to do with him.  And he's got to leave me alone.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have Steve from FoundryMusic.com walk me up and down the hall now.  Oh, is that it?  That's how bad it's gotten.  So I completely lost it, started screaming. 
[00:10:00]  I told him, leave me the F alone.  Right.  Know what I'm thinking, Ant?  What?  Mail room.  No, the old Carol Miller setup.  Mail room.  Mail room.  Well, every night when we get off the air here, right outside the door is Al Dukes and the  rest of Ron and Fez people coming in to set up for their show.  So you want Al Dukes to sit in the mail room. 
[00:10:30]  I want to go back to the mail room.  Until you pass by the mail room on your way to our office.  How well did that work last time we had a problem?  We never had to see or speak to Carol Miller.  That's true.  It did work well.  Well, if he thinks in some way, shape, or form it makes you happy, I'm sure he'd do it.  Well, that's why I want to get Ron and Fez on the line, because I don't want to make them  more uncomfortable than they already are. 
[00:11:00]  But I want to set up the mail room thing, without a doubt.  Everyone knows when we walk back down to our office, and he can just wait.  Wait in the mail room.  Or wait in Ron and Fez's office.  As soon as he sees us pass by, then he can come out.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, Opie, you've got to do me a favor.  You've got to take the wiffle ball bat challenge bat and smash the crap out of the pinball machine.  You know what?  I think I might take the Jeremy puzzle.  How about the dildo?  What the hell's the name of the guy that was fixed?  Get rid of two things at once.  Look at Ben's freaking out. 
[00:11:30]  Ben really likes that pinball game.  It's broken already, you said.  What's wrong with it?  You've got to smash it to pieces.  Wait, wait, what happened?  Hold on, Anthony.  It's not like completely screwed, but if the ball goes on like the left side of the two  bumpers, it will go into the hole.  But if you play on the right side, you understand what I'm saying?  What do you mean it'll go into the hole?  There's like one thing bent somehow.  I don't know.  I guess it happened last night.  Everyone's blaming Earl for it.  Fez is on the line here, I believe.  Fezzy!  Fezzy!  I am so embarrassed.  I'm just humiliated.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  That was quite the conversation.  But, you know, if you keep talking about the pinball machine and things being bent and  going into the hole, you're just going to turn him on more.  Yeah, I don't get what's going on with him.  I was listening last night.  I could barely listen.  It was very embarrassing.  I could barely listen and I was on the show.  Why does he care so much about my stupid life?  He's obsessed.  Why?  What have I done? 
[00:12:30]  Is it a thing maybe where it's one of those guys where everyone has to like him?  It's either that or it doesn't matter that everyone else either likes or tolerates him.  It's the one that he can't get.  Right.  That's the one you want always.  That's most important to him.  See, everyone else doesn't care about him.  Just kind of, you know, like I even go.  He said last night, I even, if I see him in the hall, I now go, hey, what's up?  And I walk by.  So that's fine.  But the one person here that does not acknowledge him is the one he needs approval from the most. 
[00:13:00]  Opie has become the great white whale to him.  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  He wants the Moby Dick.  Moby Dick.  That was, that got so weird at the end of the show yesterday, Fezzy.  It was just bizarre.  And I thought, you know, it's another Stalker Patty situation.  Opie's going to lose his voice.  It's going to be our fault because he's just screaming, stop it at Al.  I was screaming, stop it.  My cell phone was crapping out.  I was getting so pissed off last night.  Hey, Fez, would this be acceptable now, Opie's idea of leaving Al Dukes maybe in your office 
[00:13:30]  until we pass by?  I say mail room him.  Mail room him now.  All right.  You know what?  He'll actually be thrilled because he's going to think it's mail, M-A-L-E.  Oh, well, that's true.  You know, because now, you know, he's going to probably show up in the next hour or two.  So now I'm going to be uncomfortable.  I'm surprised you didn't come to work today to an office full of flowers.  Because now I'm going to think the guy's in love with me. 
[00:14:00]  Think?  The guy, you know, and don't get mad or anything because this is no reflection on you or your  sexuality or anything.  We all know you've had a girlfriend for many years.  Everything's fine.  So believe me, it's no reflection on you.  I have a fiance and agri-faults.  Oh, of course you do, Fezzy, yes.  And I tear it up, man.  Yeah, yeah.  We have hot sex.  Yeah, sure you do.  Yeah, yeah.  But Al Dukes is in love with you. 
[00:14:30]  He is in love with you.  In some way, shape, or form.  I don't know if that's fantasies of some kind of sex or if it's just like a cuddling, nuzzling  thing.  There is a love that this man has for you.  It's a mail crush, Ope.  Oh.  You know, that means only one thing.  Get the sledgehammer.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Do you really think that, Ant?  If you think that...  Dude, I seriously think that. 
[00:15:00]  And I'm not even kidding.  Get me the sledgehammer.  I'm not even kidding.  Ope, seriously, if we analyze it, look at the gift he gave you.  Yep.  A Rolling Stones pinball machine.  You have to play the thing.  You have to stare at Mick Jagger's junk to play it.  Yeah.  And they made it extra large on this machine for whatever reason.  It's just...  It's the...  And don't...  You know, you just look up and there it is.  You don't have to search it out.  Trust me.  I thought it was the third flipper.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, where's that Rolling Stones song he sang? 
[00:15:30]  I got it.  You know what?  If...  Oh, you got it.  I know you don't want to talk to Al Dukes to get it.  I got it.  Oh, Rick has it.  Rory Hamptons would have it.  I think Rick's got it.  Hold on.  Rick's got it.  Great.  Great.  If A works today, then we got it, because it's not B.  Definitely it.  This is it?  Is it ready to play, or you got to kind of...  Ready to play?  All right, hold on, Fezzy.  I can't wait.  I got to make sure you get to hear this, too.  So this is...  I get out of the Islander game.  Fezzy, I swear to God, I was convinced you guys talked about this for four straight hours  last night.  I swear to you, we didn't. 
[00:16:00]  I turned off the show, and you guys are still talking.  The Islanders win, then I get back in my car, and now I have him singing to me while  I'm trying to get home.  Here it is.  Oh, my God.  Ope hates the new machine, I have to take it back.  Oh, my God.  Called me a closet bag, I have to take it back.  I screwed with the biggest show, it's called Career Suicide. 
[00:16:30]  Oh.  Ope doesn't want a thing from me, he wants a piece of my hide.  What?  No, I don't.  Ope still won't say hello, I have to take it back.  Ope just wants me to go and take the machine back.  I tried to buy new friends, I tried to show some class.  I further burned the bridge, I'm such a stupid ass. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  I look inside my...  And that's it.  Oh, my God.  And that's it.  You want a piece of his hide.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah.  I'm so embarrassed, I'm listening under a blanket.  Yeah.  Isn't that awful?  With his pants on.  Yeesh.  We definitely have a problem around here.  Yeah.  Just when the station started to feel cool, we have a problem.  Yep.  Let's try the mailroom solution first. 
[00:17:30]  I...  Then the sledgehammer.  No, I need sledgehammer today.  Oh.  No, no.  I need sledgehammer today, and I need the Ron approval, and I need the Fez approval.  Do I have at least the Fez approval, and then I'll wait for the Ron approval?  You know what?  After what you went through last night, I'll sign anything you want.  Oh.  Fez approval.  Just waiting for Ron to give his approval.  Oh, no.  Get the sledgehammer.  Oh, no.  No, no.  If Ann thinks he is in love with me, this will solve it. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Just waiting for Ronnie.  And then just leave the pieces on Al's desk.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  No, look.  How much did he spend on this?  $3,000, he claims.  I cannot be part of this.  I have never gotten a gift over $200 in my life.  That's what I was wondering.  If today you got there and there was a mink or something.  Hold on.  That's like a...  That's a present that...  Ann, talk to Fez for a sec.  I got it.  I just want to size up.  If the sledgehammer will be better...  Or the baseball bat.  Yeah, I just got to say, a $3,000 gift is something that if you are in a great relationship 
[00:18:30]  with somebody, you would get them that if you're doing very well.  I mean, the Kennedys don't exchange gifts like that.  What is he doing?  He's sizing up.  Oh, my God.  He's sizing up.  Hold on.  I got to get on another mic.  Just two seconds.  Let me get over here.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Let me get on this mic over here.  Is this one on?  I'm sizing it up.  Oh, you're sizing up.  Damn, you scared the crap out of me. 
[00:19:00]  You scared the crap out of me.  Dude, I've been in this business a long time.  If I'm smashing this, it's going to be after commercials.  Hey, all right.  So, I got your approval.  If Ron gives the approval, it's done.  Done deal.  All right.  You're halfway there.  Look at Opie going to the people.  It's like a hit has to go down.  You got to go through the proper channels or else you'll get whacked yourself.  I'm showing respect to the Ron and Fez family.  That is.  Showing a little respect.  Appreciate it.  Where the hell is Ronnie today? 
[00:19:30]  I have no idea where Ron is.  Contrary to popular belief, we do not share an apartment.  Well, could you try to get him on the line?  I will look for Ronnie.  This needs to be done today.  Thank you, Fez.  All right, bro.  All right.  There he goes, Fezzy.  We got to take a break.  Do we have those science goggles still?  I'm freaking out.  Okay, good.  Because I know, you know something?  I know you too well.  You better set up the mice because as soon as the call comes in from Ron, it's not even,  it's not even a question. 
[00:20:00]  It is just out there.  Get rid of it.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking through all types of...  You know Ronnie is fighting his conscience right now.  He's just like...  He's the guy with his finger on the button right now.  He's the godfather now.  I'm waiting for his approval.  I'm looking at pinball websites because I want confirmation on the price and on the...  And just ask our listeners.  Someone will come up with the price in a second. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, but I can't trust them.  I've got to see it myself.  I don't know.  We'll get one of the collectors on the line.  We'll get the company that he got it from.  Oh, I know it's a collector's item.  Believe me.  I'm just saying, I don't know how, I don't know how much, how many they made, what the  price is.  He says three grand and they made a thousand of them.  Right now on eBay, we have $585.  For the same one?  For the same exact one. 
[00:21:00]  And judging by this picture, it is in better condition than the one we have.  1980 Bally's Rolling Stone pinball game, outstanding, clean, original condition.  Ready to plug and play without any necessary repair jobs.  Cabinet very clean.  Shows some wear around flipper buttons.  Colors are bright and not faded out.  You know, dude, it's $585.  That's it?  Yeah.  Matt Devote says he knows the price.  Oh, Matt hung up.  Let me go to Kevin.  Kevin, where do you work? 
[00:21:30]  Classic pinball.  I own it.  You own this pinball?  Yes.  Is this Hope?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  How you doing, man?  All right.  Smashing it's a bad idea.  You better get all your plugs in so you're not pissed at me.  I'm not pissed at you.  Classicpinball.com?  That's me.  And where are you located in Clipson, New Jersey?  We're on Valley Road.  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  I was just there yesterday setting it up.  Why is it a bad idea to smash it?  Because it's a nice game.  There's not that many left floating around, although they didn't make only a thousand of them. 
[00:22:00]  They didn't only make a thousand.  No, they made about 5,700 of them.  Ah, I see Al Dukes is also a liar.  He lies, he exaggerates, he's a liar.  And just so you guys know, I'd have brought you a Pac-Man if that's what they told me to bring.  Well, the guy doesn't even know me.  For a stalker, he doesn't do a good job.  And he didn't tell me any of the story either.  There was a friend of mine, Donnie, told me the story when we got in the van to leave there.  He told me the whole thing about what happened with the foosball table.  Yeah.  Now, how much does this thing go for? 
[00:22:30]  Now, the $3,000 number, it's a high number, but they do command that through certain dealers.  They change hands among collectors for $8,000 to $1,500 needing work.  Well, I just saw a mint one for $585.  Well, that's the first bid, don't they?  Yeah, that's probably the first bid on eBay, but that'll go much higher.  The first bid was like $400.  Oh, okay.  He was looking for $5.  Can I let you in on some other little dirt that's going to make you hate Al even more?  Yeah.  All right.  He didn't buy that from me.  He didn't buy it from you. 
[00:23:00]  He didn't buy that from me.  That's on loan.  I can take that out and bring you anything you want.  All right.  He didn't tell me any of the scoop.  He just said, you know, we just want to put a game in here, you know, and we'll plug you on the air.  Oh, is that it?  He traded?  Borrowing the game for plugs?  Yeah.  I was just getting ready to head out to go look at some stuff at a guy's house, and we heard you talking about it, so I said, uh-oh, they're going to be calling.  So it's ClassicPinball.com.  Right.  All right.  We mentioned you twice times $2,000. 
[00:23:30]  That's $4,000 worth of advertising right there.  Okay.  Well, go smash it then.  Well, you know what you should do?  Instead of smashing it, you know, think up a good way to give it away or something.  That's hokey radio.  I've got to break this kid's heart.  How about if I bring you something else to smash?  No, you're going to bring us something else nice.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Tell me what you want, and we'll get it.  All right.  Hold on the line and talk to Rick, okay?  Okay.  I want to play a little, uh, before you smash it. 
[00:24:00]  Well, we'll take a break.  All right.  I'll play a little.  Someone's got to find Ron.  I can't do this without Ron's blessing.  I got Fezzy's blessing.  I am certain Ron will call in before we leave.  Yeah, but that's like a goofy radio tease.  No, no.  I don't want to tease like that either.  I want it to be a medium.  I want it to happen, like, after break.  I want it to happen soon.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Ann.  So that's where we stand.  Mm-hmm.  Ronnie calls.  Rolling Stone.  Pinball machine is history.  Ronnie, if you're out there, please give us a call. 
[00:24:30]  If anyone knows where Ronnie is, he's got to call the Opie and Anthony show today.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Just waiting for Ron's blessing, Anthony.  1027.  The Opie and Anthony show.  W and E W.  Let's Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  W and E W.  W.  Hey, look who I'm looking here who just walked into the studio. 
[00:25:00]  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  We would have been here earlier since Foundry Music Steve stopped us down the hall.  Pablo gets to walk right in.  We get stopped.  Oh, look at the callback.  I love it.  Well, he's had a security there, Fezzy.  Ron, what were you doing all day that no one could contact you?  We're taking care of stuff, buddy.  Oh.  We're taking care of stuff.  Big news.  Big news is coming up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Big news.  Yeah.  Are you going to become a sports guy? 
[00:25:30]  Is that the news?  That's like hearing you just got cancer.  That's going to be a new promo, I hear.  That's like saying, is it malignant?  That's what they say.  Malignant.  Well, it is the same as saying you've got three months.  Right.  It's the same thing.  Put your affairs in order.  Morning.  You're a sports guy.  Sports guy.  Although, Fez is now Pharrell Fez, whatever the hell that means.  Is that it?  I don't know why.  Yeah.  We like Scott Pharrell.  We love it.  Whatever works for you. 
[00:26:00]  I haven't met him yet.  We like this sports guy combo.  There's a combo now?  Yeah.  There's always a combo.  There's always a combo.  You're always just changing the numbers a little bit.  I like the Scotty Pharrell in the same way I like to watch a small child play with a loaded gun.  Because, you know, someday he's just going to kill himself with it.  The best advice.  Yeah, right.  And you enjoy that.  Right.  It's fun to watch.  If you like him, the best advice is never take a vacation, Scott.  Yeah.  You know, Blaine's going, you know, I don't really need any time off.  I'm fine. 
[00:26:30]  How surprised was Blaine?  He took two weeks off for Christmas and had a job when he came back.  Right.  Blaine was in here Christmas morning looking around.  Everything okay?  Is it cool?  So, Ron?  All right.  Let me get this straight.  You get a beautiful collector's item from Al Dukes.  Oh, he collects stuff like this.  Oh, yeah.  I got a Robotron.  That thing is, but my Robotron's worth $2,000.  I love Robotron.  Now, this, when I walked in there, it's like Captain Fantastic at Elton John's.  Right.  Only $1,000 made.  Well, we're here in $5,700. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, is that right?  But who's counting?  And I just saw on eBay there's one of those available in better condition for that $570.  Oh, I heard $3,000.  Yeah, well.  What happened to the $3,000?  I ain't talking it up.  It's like the engagement ring all of a sudden turns out to be a cubic zirconium.  That's right.  And a certificate proving that it's fake.  Well, no matter what we do, I say we sell it if you don't like it.  We were offered $1,200.  Ain't about the money.  $1,200?  It's not about the money.  Why don't we do this?  And then all the proceeds go to a half ounce of Coke that we can relax with. 
[00:27:30]  It's going to be okay, okay?  Let me tell you something.  It's going to be great, okay?  That's Pablo Escobar.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Pablo Escobar.  That's when radio was great, when you could just sell one of those guitars off the air.  That's some Coke.  Listen, I'm serious.  Just take it, and then I'll get back to you with the rest of the money.  That's Clapton's guitar!  That's Clapton's!  Clapton's!  You've got to write a book, too.  Yeah, right.  Well, no, it's not about the money.  It's about breaking his heart.  See, this is the thing.  This is what it's all about. 
[00:28:00]  Al Dukes is, I've said this, in love with Opie.  Let's not candy coat this.  He's in love with the man.  Right.  And it's a little disturbing.  No, it's true, though.  It is!  He pictures Opie up on top of that pinball machine like it was Jodie Foster.  Jodie Foster in The Accused.  Oh, awful.  What?  There we are.  Now we sit and...  Well, it's yours to do whatever you want with. 
[00:28:30]  That's the way I see it.  Well, I'm sure he'll replace it with something much more lavish if you destroy this one.  Ron Corleone, I'm asking you...  If you're going to do this thing...  No one came to me.  There was a kid who brought in a pinball machine.  When it was smashed, I didn't go looking.  I didn't ask any questions.  Because this is the business we've chose.  No, you've got to do what you've got to do, Opie.  I'm just showing respect to your family.  That is respect.  That's total respect. 
[00:29:00]  I don't want to smash the machine.  You're going to keep bringing me back in.  Ron Corleone.  It's up to you.  I mean, do you think you'll feel better smashing a collectible pinball machine?  He always feels better when he smashes people's gifts.  I'm just afraid we're not going to get anything ever again.  Because every time...  All right, hold on.  Remember Anthony Limo guy brought in the Jets gumball machine?  Right.  Nice.  Smash.  It was a stupid bobbly head.  Stalker Patty, everything she brings in.  Smash.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Remember when Rascals gave us the Louis XIII scotch? 
[00:29:30]  The cognac.  Cognac, whatever?  Yeah.  Nice.  Didn't smash that.  No, it's...  I love when, like, Caroline's and people bring the really expensive champagne by.  Nice.  It's got to be expensive.  Yeah, right.  Well, the cheap stuff.  Come on.  We all know.  And then we get some bottles of wine from time to time.  You know what I got today that I'm fully enjoying and will not smash?  A Kurt Cobain poster from the fine folks down there in Philly at WYSP.  The Kurt and Courtney movie poster. 
[00:30:00]  Nice.  So I don't break everything.  Isn't it an after poster?  Was he laying there on the ground?  Fit just the feet.  You know it, feet, showin'.  You know you're going to get the calls now.  Dude, shut up.  You know, he was a genius, man, Dick.  I just don't like...  You wish you had the talent he had in his...  I just don't like kiss asses.  He's a kissin' ass.  He's just ridiculous.  I know in his heart he thought that you were just going to say, okay, Al.  Right.  This was unbelievable.  This is what I said. 
[00:30:30]  Man, you should hang.  Right.  He thought this was going to turn into, Al, man, you know, we had our thing.  Or maybe even that Opie would go, ah, it's been a bit, you know, I just wanted to go.  But I really want you to know I appreciate the pinball machine.  Everything's great.  Now open mouth kiss me.  Oh, we're...  You know?  Oh.  That's how he feels.  I can tell.  The guy is attracted to you.  Right.  The guy talks in terms of relationships.  He used that word.  The relationship with Opie.  I know.  He wants to hang out.  They'll laugh about this over beers when they're hanging. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, what...  He asked your girlfriend about you, like, what kind of things you like to do.  What he's like off the air.  Yeah.  That really put it over the top when he's asking my girlfriend, well, how is he like off  the air?  Yeah.  See, I think the strategy is...  How do you have a effing business?  He buys you a big enough gift that he has to help you move it home.  Oh, is that it?  That he gets to see your house.  I think late at night, he's looking out his window like Fievel, just wondering what  the hell you're up to.  He's glancing.  I'm well out there. 
[00:31:30]  He's just gazing towards Long Island.  What's your high score?  I know he's doing something.  That's how he feels about you, though.  Is he all uncomfortable in the back office?  Yeah.  Oh, we're reenacting the mailroom thing.  Have to.  Yeah.  The Caramel or Mailroom.  Keep him in the mailroom until Opie passes by him.  That really happened.  For about six months around here.  I had no problem with that.  It was the only way to separate certain radio hosts from each other.  What are we doing?  Make him say goodbye to his machine. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, God.  Make him say goodbye to it.  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye.  Make him say goodbye, dude.  On the unit.  Make him say I'm going to miss you to Mick Jagger.  Rick, you got a mic?  Go outside the studio.  He's not coming in the studio.  Grab him and make him come down.  Where did he get the pinball from?  Because I don't want that guy to suffer.  Classic Pinball Corporation.  Oh, they're great, by the way.  Yeah.  Classic Pinball.  Classic Pinball.  Corporation.  They're incorporated now, you know.  ClassicPinball.com.  You've got to check this stuff out. 
[00:32:30]  ClassicPinball.com.  I think they were going to give us the Space Invaders, but I don't see that happening.  Oh, see, now you've got my soft spot.  They're going great.  We'll bring it down.  What time's Opie going to take a dump on it?  Thank you very much.  ClassicPinball.com.  9-7-3-3-4-5-3-9-4-4.  That's worth at least $1,000 on our show.  So they can't be picked up.  Go get Al.  No, don't bring him in here.  Not in here.  Let him stand outside.  It's really uncomfortable.  It's embarrassing. 
[00:33:00]  Dude, just make him stand in the corner over there, like in the Blair Witch Project.  He has to stand in the corner as Opie kills the machine.  With his back to the pinball machine.  With his back to the machine.  So he just hears the horrible sounds of it.  All right, have him lay down, and he doesn't know whether the pinball machine is going to  get hit or him.  Don't give Opie that choice.  We'll be playing pinball after it's all done.  And you'll finally get your new producer.  If you can kneecap him, then don't break the machine.  Oh, a little hobbling. 
[00:33:30]  So what are we doing?  Oh, is this Al Dukes?  Yes, it is.  Where are you?  I'm in one of the production rooms.  Oh.  Why don't you...  Are you staring at us right now?  Are you watching Opie?  No, I'm in a closed office.  I'm watching you through the glass, Opie.  I'm in the way you are.  Game.  Yeah.  You're holding the phone with one hand, and what are you doing with the other as you gaze  at the man you love?  No, I'm not attracted to Opie.  Oh, really?  No.  You sure know how to show it.  It was just, I brought a nice gesture. 
[00:34:00]  Do you understand that's a nice gesture reserved for couples, maybe, that have been in love?  Maybe a guy is a collector of these things, and his wife scrapes up money for years to  afford something like this, and you just get it for Opie for what?  For what?  For as a gesture to say, hey...  A gesture gift is a bottle.  A bottle of maybe Captain Morgan rum.  Here's a good gesture.  It's like, here, it mixes well with Coke.  Here you go.  Both kinds. 
[00:34:30]  Guys don't buy other guys' stuff.  Especially stuff like that.  Did this fantasy of yours end with Opie taking a baseball bat to the present?  Did this come into your equation anywhere?  No, I don't have any fantasies about Opie.  I was just making a nice gesture, just, hey, whatever...  To make your relationship better?  To make your relationship with him better?  A work relationship.  I'll say this, but first he asked me if Opie skied.  He wanted to get him skis.  Now, that's strange. 
[00:35:00]  Were you talking about skis?  No, he goes, does he Opie ski?  I go, I don't know.  You know how personal...  Because I like to get him skis.  He wanted to get you any sort of athletic wear.  Yeah, some kind of vest he wanted to get you off of.  Skis are such a personal item.  Really is.  Go to Aspen and have a little romantic ski party.  Yeah, you want to go to Aspen with him?  Little ski party.  Aspen.  Aspen, yeah.  Aspen, yeah.  Kevin.  Yeah, I'm here.  From ClassicPinball.com.  That's me.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi.  Hey, Al, look who's on the phone. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, Al, how you doing?  It's your dealer.  What are they going to do?  Well, it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, looking grim.  Looking grim, huh?  Do you have repairs over there?  Why don't you make it out?  We do extensive repairs.  Yeah, you might have to.  Extensive.  I think we should just save the pieces, maybe, and sell them off, you know, one piece of glass  at a time.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's getting up.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, he's getting up.  Oh, he's getting up. 
[00:36:00]  He's slow.  Oh, no.  He's getting up.  He's getting up.  Now, that thing's worth a lot of money, right?  It is.  Oh, Pete.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Tell the answer to run.  Everyone's kind of running away from the area.  What a difference a day makes.  Okay, now, oh, my Kim.  Oh, my God.  Everybody was happy yesterday.  Now.  Oh, God.  All right, hold on here.  Did you guys restore that, uh, that pinball machine?  Was it wrecked when you were?  Oh, boy.  It was, it was pretty trash.  Nothing worked. 
[00:36:30]  Dirty.  He used to do rails off the top of it.  Are the decals the same as the originals?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right.  He's got the sledgehammer.  Oh, my God.  Hey, all I got to tell you.  Who's going to mic this?  Maybe someone should shield their frigging eyes.  I predict Opie cutting his wrist.  I don't think he's going to do it.  I don't think he's going to do it.  Jesus Christ.  Look, look, man.  It is.  Dude, it's a classic.  Don't.  Oh, he's almost fell off the chair. 
[00:37:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's like a movie from Christie.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, he's got it.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  It took like a year to find that thing.  Watch this.  Where's Al?  Make Al watch.  Wait a minute.  They're pulling him out.  Jesus Christ.  They're pulling him out, Opie.  Have you ever seen Rambo First Blood 2?  He got you this thing out of the goodness of his heart.  This is just going to be like that scene in Rocky 3 where Pauly throws the bottle right  through the pinball machine.  Oh, look at his face. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, no.  I mean, this is what you want to do.  There's Al.  Hey, Al.  Hey, Opie, I dare you to smash it.  It's so sad.  There's your voice.  It's so sad.  With the mallet.  I dare you.  This is so cool.  I mean, I just got it as a gesture.  Hey, Al, will you accept Visa, MasterCard?  Business relationship thing.  Oh, boy.  I can't stop it.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  It's gone. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, no, no.  The football table.  Look out.  Did you hear that?  There's pinball collectors throwing themselves out windows.  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  Yeah, that's copyrighted material.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  Dude, he completely didn't think you were going to do that.  He totally did not believe you were really going to do that. 
[00:38:30]  That's what I think of your gift.  I can't believe it.  And that's what I think of you.  Oh, God.  There is a mess out there.  Make him clean it up.  It looks like a car wreck.  Make him clean it up.  You can't even tell what it was.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  It looks like James Dean's car.  Save the pieces.  He said save the pieces.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There are no pieces left.  There hit the flippers and hit Mick Jagger right in the groin and he disappears. 
[00:39:00]  Now, do you have a kiss machine?  Maybe you'd like kiss.  Oh, God.  No kiss.  No kiss.  You want a kiss machine?  No.  No.  Don't send anything.  Why don't you just hit it with a hammer over there?  Probably a better idea.  Yeah.  Just break it there.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this.  I'm going to look at it.  That's what I think.  All right.  Well, um.  The warranty just expired.  I can't believe you guys did that.  I might be right.  It was fun.  I want to get a girl and flash that. 
[00:39:30]  Uh-oh.  What's happening now?  Classicpinball.com.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  We'll be back in just a bit.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  We were talking about this yesterday.  Celine Dion, she's retiring. 
[00:40:00]  Stop.  Don't even talk about it.  I get all two and come.  Yeah, Celine.  Which is a complete joke.  She's going to go away for two years.  And then she's going to come back.  She's going to be bigger and better than ever for all those fat housewives.  Her big comeback.  She'll have her big comeback.  She's not retiring forever.  She's too young.  There's nothing else she's going to do.  No.  She's going to try to start a family.  Yeah.  She'll be back.  So, Oprah Winfrey made a huge deal about this.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:40:30]  Stop.  Was it yesterday?  On yesterday's show, they had Celine Dion.  Oh.  I hate this song, man.  This is dedicated to the people of the Titanic.  All of those who perished.  Beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic, I send this song out to all the people and to  the survivors, those who were able to live on with their lives after the great ship went 
[00:41:00]  down.  You stole another bit from me, you bastard.  Yeah, that's obvious, man.  I used to do that one, man.  I don't do many.  Come on.  The brave people who could survive the icy waters of the North Atlantic in their boats  watching the mighty Titanic slowly slip beneath the surface of the water.  This song goes out to them.  The survivors. 
[00:41:30]  Anyway.  But she sings perfectly.  What a tool.  Her voice is all effed up, but she sings perfectly.  Yeah.  Perfect English.  Listen to her.  Anyway, do we have the letter from the Oprah Winfrey show?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, where is it?  Please.  So, here it is.  It was a tear fest on Oprah yesterday.  And they read this letter from this guy.  Well, we're going to mock this guy.  So, I want to say in advance that he's okay now. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, he's okay.  It's just, I mean, I don't care what you got.  I'm sorry about that.  But you sound like the biggest pussy in the world.  This guy does sound like the biggest pussy in the world.  And during the cry fest, they had this guy read his letter that he sent to Celine.  We've received a lot of mail from viewers who've been moved by Celine's music.  Brian Kloos was watching our show the last time Celine was here and wrote us this letter.  Take a look.  Dear Oprah, I'm sitting in my hospital room going through a bone marrow transplant for lymphoma. 
[00:42:30]  I'm a grown man crying after watching Celine Dion sing the theme to Titanic on your show.  I found out about Celine in one of your previous shows and fell in love with her music, voice,  and great attitude for life and family.  And camel toe.  At that time, I was just diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
[00:43:00]  Ow.  Hearing Celine sing some of her songs had me bawling.  Her song, Because You Loved Me, couldn't have hit home more perfectly about the way I feel about my wife, Kathy.  Listening to the song, wasn't sure where my future was going, how I was going to survive the cancer and fight it and things like that.  It just really hit home.  After the show, I went right out and bought the CD and gave it to my wife.  To this day, Kathy and I can't listen to the song, Because You Loved Me, without crying. 
[00:43:30]  Kathy was a strong, loving woman, a special, special lady.  And my eyes clapped, and so I couldn't imagine a day without her.  She's everything to me.  Brian and Kathy, we thought your letter was sweet.  We wanted to do something special for you.  So, you're going to her final performance. 
[00:44:00]  Listen to Oprah.  I am so happy for you guys.  Thank you.  Oh, great.  You're going to be there for the final performance.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  You know, I got to jump in here.  God forbid I was, you know, at a cancer scare, Anthony.  God forbid, really.  And, you know, like this guy, he decided he needs to go see Celine Dion.  Yeah.  Know what would be better than that?  Being able to watch Oprah at Sunday brunch.  Yeah, that's what you want to see. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, if I had my choice.  If I had my choice, Anthony.  Went through all the chemo, you know.  My hair's in patches all over my head.  Oh.  Am I going to see Celine Dion sing the Titanic song?  No.  I want to see Oprah Winfrey at Sunday brunch.  That's when I know Oprah cares. 
[00:45:30]  I want to see Celine.  Jesus.  Oh, more Celine.  I don't want...  Be sensitive.  I want to be home and do some cooking and stay home and have no schedule and no pressure  and say, let's go for a picnic and drive my own car and pick my own tomatoes.  Pick my own tomatoes and give myself a frontal wedgie every day.  Looks like I have ass in the front.  Buy some new yo-yos for the front of my pants.  My pants sink deeper than the Titanic in the front. 
[00:46:00]  A crevice in the front when I wear my jump pants that is deeper than the crevice made  by the iceberg in the mighty bow of the Titanic.  It actually looks like I was straddling the iceberg and the bow of the Titanic struck me  right in my camel toe.  That's what made this big gully when I wear my tight jumpsuit.  You see my tight jumpsuit and my pelvis bones that jet out? 
[00:46:30]  I am the iceberg.  The Titanic slammed into my crotch at approximately 12 knots.  The man in the crow's nest yelled,  Hamilton, dead ahead!  But the mighty Titanic could not stop.  It hit my groin at 12 knots,  ripping open many watertight compartments  and leaving me with a hatchet wound unlike no other.  This goes out to the survivors 
[00:47:00]  who before they sank,  before they got into their lifeboats,  were able to take one last look  in the lights of the distress flares  and see my camel toe.  The camel toe that brought down the mighty Titanic  on her maiden voyage.  Can you believe it?  Who thought a gas could bring down a mighty ocean liner 
[00:47:30]  like the Titanic?  They called it unsinkable.  Now, Celine, how many people lost their lives in your crotch?  I believe it was 750 people died  because of my camel toe. 
[00:48:00]  If you look,  some nights when I am in concert with my tight jumpsuit,  you can see on each thigh,  HMS Titanic  and anchor wounds.  Now I know why Leonardo DiCaprio's face was blue.  It was from the smell.  Hold on, Jack!  The ship thought unsinkable and iceberg proof 
[00:48:30]  proved not to be camel toe proof.  The yo-yo I smuggled could take down the Queen Mary.  But that goes out to the survivors.  Those who were able to live on  and make their dreams come true  and get the nightmarish image of my groin  out of their head forever.  I'm quitting show business.  Uh, Fred!  Anthony has a serious future 
[00:49:00]  as a Celine Dion impersonator.  When you say the words,  survivor.  This song is dedicated to  the Titanic  and its fearless crew  and passengers.  Not just those that perished  in the icy waters of the North Atlantic,  but also  to the survivors.  Excellent!  Alright, Fred.

[01:04:30]  running yeah yeah what year is that huh what year is it it has the emblem that's all that matters  but what year is that thing like uh uh 92 it's not it's a 92 it's a 92 and i'm a good driver it's a  92 that was the one year they brought back the crank start joe yeah you have a guess we're trying 
[01:05:00]  to figure out how rich voss made history yeah one of the uh only comedians to go 20 consecutive  shows without a laugh oh stop it it was like 22 the guy is very funny he really is funny this is a  character character uh let's go to mike mike you have an answer for us i think he had the longest  career as a dryer door salesman the longest career as a dryer door salesman  tony what's going on yeah i just wanted to say something to voss yeah what's that it's kind of 
[01:05:30]  interesting to me that your sex life and your comedy actor are very much in the same being that  you're the only one who enjoys them oh oh you rule man  i like that one that was a good one i can't wait to use it hey norton  these goddamn callers really make me laugh that was a good one all right dwayne what's up  hey what's up guys hey i figured it out i know exactly what voss did yeah he was the first person 
[01:06:00]  ever eat an apple through a picket fence oh god what's that what's that mean eat an apple through  a picket fence look at the teeth on him oh oh boy teeth jokes now i'm sorry man dan from dan  from hoboken wants to know if it's true that voss is driving around in hitler's mercedes benz  was it actually owned and driven by adolf hitler himself how is that self for any self-respecting  jew no you're wrong because first of all i would never buy a new one and send money back to the 
[01:06:30]  german economy this was used so the money didn't go back there okay i have morals justify i have  morals all right uh larry off your feedback from jersey voss would make history if he paid his bill  at the paint store oh hey what's that all about what's that about bro there's some guy from the  paint store that you owe money to that you're dodging when i had my paint business oh yeah i owed a lot of  well i i would back then is when i was getting you know partying getting high and stuff and you know  i used to get a lot of i had a lot of credit i had a big paint business like during the winter i 
[01:07:00]  would get everybody's money as a deposit you know right summer you know to do their houses and i'd  spend it all you know and i told them i was going to use benjamin moore but i had those cans  and i'd put like woolworth paint in it and stuff because i spent the money on blow  oh god we are we are oh my god that's great and all of a sudden the paint store wants their money  they all want yeah they all want their money hey you know what i took care of that when i did  bankruptcy now leave me alone you're not getting your money all right i hope your house is peeling 
[01:07:30]  all right i'll get listen i can get into it i'll send i'll send you a cd now leave me alone  you're not getting your money this is a fine satin coat of benjamin moore paint i had the cans though  all right you should listen to benjamin moore cans but i poured woolworth paint and you poured the  cheap paint in there and let's go over the house okay you should have listened to your friends who got  aluminum siding all right stupid i would go to work i had my own business and i would go to work  i would sit up to guys and then i would like because i was all whacked off and then i'd go to the 
[01:08:00]  park and lay in the sun and i'd come back lunchtime see how things were going the business failed  i own paint stores i own lumber yards all right that's why it's a 92 mercedes not a 99  uh doug what's going on oh doug yeah hey uh i heard boss's uh cd finally won aluminum foil is that  true did it go aluminum how many copies do you have to sell for it to go aluminum foil five i think  it i think it's like three three and it goes aluminum foil cd's great and uh i think he bought

[01:42:30]  half hour  left on  today's  show  they've  already  played  bingo  with  collars  bra  sizes  and one  of the  contestants  for the  planned  blind  boxing  bout  has  cancelled  damn  it  facing  the  threat  of  some  outrage  free  airtime  kumia  and  hughes  grudgingly  allow a  time-ravaged  stripper  named  sandy  kane  into the  studio  time-ravaged  that felt like  something from  a science fiction  this crap  is funny  man  time-ravaged  stripper  named  sandy  kane  into their  studio  to perform  a raunchy  ballad  they've  what the 
[01:43:00]  heck is  that  i was  looking for  this  they're  forced to  bleep out  several  forbidden  phrases  and hughes  warns  we're gonna  let you  try it  one more  time  but if  we have  to dump  out again  we're all  gonna throw  stuff at  you  they replayed  this segment  yesterday  when we  were taking  the day  off  when she  makes it  through the  number  a twisted  love song  for jerry  seinfeld  hughes  shrugs  let's  throw  stuff at  her  anyway  we're  just  idiots  all the  time  kane 
[01:43:30]  freezes  before the  mics  as all  five  guys  in the  studio  begin  hurling  audio  cassettes  half-filled  bottles of  water  and my  favorite  and copies  of black  tail  magazine  at the  wall  just  past  her  head  sparks  is  frantically  picking up  after his  bosses  as an  overstimulated  hughes  lifts his  office chair  over his  head  and smashes  it to the  floor  we're a  bunch of  monkeys in  here  that's funny  they nailed  ben though  because ben 
[01:44:00]  always is  like oh  my god  oh my god  and pointing  up after  us  red face  and sweaty  with ten  minutes to  go  we're all  we're just  a mess  hughes  and kumia  are about  to resort  to the  day's  second  game  of broad  bingo  when in  walks  emma  a lift  20 year  old  in a t-shirt  cargo  pants  and adidas  shell  toes  hey emma  you're  hot  emma snaps  off her  leg below  the knee  removes the  sneaker and  sock and  places it on  the console  hey it's like  a real leg  says kumia  only it's  not 
[01:44:30]  what bit of  genius is  that  only it's  not  it's like  a real leg  only not  only not  that's what  i'm trying  to say  really  the guys  gaze at  the limb  with childlike  awe  you said  there  were  fake  toes  and  stuff  kumia  explains  complains  complains  yeah i was  complaining  complaining because  it didn't have  the fake toes  she said it was  like a real  foot  that's my  spare emma  says the foot  flew off the  other one  it was pretty  funny until i  realized i  couldn't walk  then she  tells him that  the car accident  that cost her  the lower  part of a leg 
[01:45:00]  also left her  clinically dead  for several  minutes  was there a  tunnel and  light and all  that  kumia  asks  if there  was i  don't remember  because they  gave me so  much morphine  what kind of  death is that  kumia says  laughing you  got gypped  well if you're  gonna die for a  few minutes you  might as well get  the whole treatment  i think we're  doing a show for  third graders  just the words  you're using  gypped and  toes and  stuff  you know  something  when we're  doing it here  it's one thing  and then you 
[01:45:30]  read it as it  happens i'm  laughing like i  never did this  right like it's  just something i'm  reading giggling  emma tells them  she wanted to  come in and  show them that  she's very  all right with  it i think it's  hilarious hughes  and kumia couldn't  agree more invite  her to come back  on the show  another day when  there's more time  i just love you  guys she coos  some people will  say it's terrible  but you know  what hughes says  earnestly  earnestly did you  say this earnestly  turn page  earnestly off the  air one-legged  people have a sense  of humor blind  people want to  have fun we're  just trying to  have fun and 
[01:46:00]  include everyone  they want to be  involved says  kumia another  brilliant quote by  myself they want to  be involved  just tell the  truth it's  really exploit them  if you think about  it if you think  about it really  uh those getting  involved include  busty cat fighters  a ventriloquist  whose dummy can't  stop shrieking  burn your meat  curtains with a  crack pipe  burn your meat  curtains with a  crack pipe you  whore get in a  coffin die  and actor jay moore  who offers uh  ribald uh  impressions and a 
[01:46:30]  target for jokes  about his career  woes popular  running gags  include whip them  out wednesday  when opie and  anthony encouraged  female fans to  expose their  breasted cars with  wow bumper stickers  f you friday when  callers ran about  everything from  traffic to cheating  wives and cripple  bouts a series of  fights between  physically challenged  listeners held right  inside the studio  the name of the  latter was changed  from battle crypts  after the show  received calls from  people claiming to  be upset gang  members  that is true  we did check it out  on that one 
[01:47:00]  in between stunts  they ponder possible  double entendres and  judas priest lyrics  now that former  frontman rob halford  has come out as gay  and howl at a  recording of chris  burke the actor with  down syndrome who  played corky and life  goes on singing a  beatle song if it  makes people uneasy to  hear someone with  down syndrome sing it  makes them laugh when  others are willing to  join in hughes and  kumia call it cringe  radio there you go  cringe radio  what's this cringe  radio yeah bill o'reilly  bill o'reilly cringe  radio if you were a  better person you  wouldn't laugh but 
[01:47:30]  you're not and  anyway where's the  beer another quote from  us anthony he doesn't  explain this next little  thing he goes if there's  an adult if there's an  adult on the show it's  hughes at 36 the  younger the two but  doesn't explain why he  says that kumia 38  dominates blocks of the  program with manic  celebrity impressions  mike tyson regis captain  quinn from jaws as  hughes works the control  panels and feeds him  ideas in performance  mode this is funny  kumia constantly flicks  his head around like  he's searching for some 
[01:48:00]  invisible object his  wiry body even seems to  vibrate when he's not  doing anything at all  when he's not cackling  hughes who still  resembles the ron  howard character from  whom he got his  nickname has two  expressions thoughtful and  weary thoughtful and  weary what the f two  expressions thoughtful and  weary both have serious  girlfriends hughes for eight  years kumia for two neither  of whom works uh we have a 
[01:48:30]  very normal relationship  says hughes she spends my  money she has a great life  works out makes me dinner  that's my girlfriend's life  jesus christ  that's awful  kitchen in the bedroom florida  don't say it james  james  co-hosting a daily frat party  ken hughes admits create the  occasional rift in a  relationship  she gets bothered sometimes  when the chicks are in the  studio but that's an important

[02:25:30]  and it's Adam  for our sitting in  on the program  today  sure  howdy  Anthony on the line  we got this Rick guy  with the strange  and wild story  alright  yeah let's hear this  hey Rick  yep  it's Opie and Anthony  and Adam Farrar  how are you today  how you guys doing  hey what's up man  hey Rick  we obviously got you  live on the radio  here in New York  City  yes I am  and I hear you got  a very unusual story  to tell  yeah it's a little  different  alright  definitely a little  different 
[02:26:00]  well I guess  it goes back to  1979  you met this girl  right  yeah I met this girl  actually she met me  she had seen me  you know around town  and liked me  because I was a  large guy anyway  I was 6'4", 240  6'4", 240 back in  1979  big guy  just out of high school  four years of football  all that good stuff  alright and 20 years  later  how much do you weigh  right now  I'm 5'37  I topped out in 1989  at about 850 
[02:26:30]  sell  sell  sell  yeah get rid of it all  and obviously  this girl had something  to do with your  drastic weight gain  yeah she did  very much so  she had a fetish  of what I'm finding  out seems to be  what is called  these feeder people  or whatever  and she sexually  got stimulated  whenever she would  watch me eat food  wow  yeah it was  to the point of where  I could sit down 
[02:27:00]  eat a piece of cake  after dinner  or something like that  and she would just  be all excited  and I would just  have to finish the job  was she a big girl  she was a whopping  98 pounds  oh wow  so she's a rail  soaking wet  wow  you guys made  you guys made  the number 10  when you stood  next to each other  just about  well yeah  later on  alright so  did you know  she had this fetish  when you met her  no I had no idea  no clue  so what was  your first clue  yeah how long  did it take  right  well my first clue 
[02:27:30]  of it really getting  to the point of  oh my god  what the hell  am I going to do  with this  was I had gotten  in a little trouble  with some marijuana  before I had met her  sure  weed  that's how it starts  that's what makes you hungry  grass  weed  that was part of it  but hey  it was California  in the 70s  Mary Jane  before you know  what you're doing  Benny's  Dexys  I bet you think  you're pretty cool  and far out  don't you  the next step  is Entenmann's cake  then you're moving  the bed into the kitchen  and then we just 
[02:28:00]  started sleeping  in a grocery store  alright so  tell us the first clue  go ahead  you got in trouble  for drugs right  I got sentenced  to a couple of months  in jail  LA County Jail  and I found out  that she had gone  to the judge  I believe  the one that  sentenced me  and told him  that her mental  state  welfare  and all that  good stuff  was dependent  upon the fact  that I stayed  large  I was up to  about  350 maybe  400 at this time  and she was afraid  of going in there 
[02:28:30]  eating that sort of food  I was going to lose  a lot of weight  this judge gave  a court order  to her  that ordered me  to receive  double portions  of food  inside the jail  come on  that's the Oprah bill  I swear  it's documented  court documents  to prove it all  wow  oh yeah  so you're in jail  for a while  yes  and you're still  packing on pounds  no because I just  refused to do it  I'm not stupid  it's uh  you know the food  was crap  so you're not  going to eat  double portions  of crap  so now how was she 
[02:29:00]  were there any other  inmates that like  to watch you eat  Bubba  uh yeah his name  was no  so how'd she  get turned on  if you're in jail  oh she didn't  actually there was  a couple of  incidences where  um um  she would come  to the uh  visiting room  yeah  she had arranged  for a private  visit which was  still through  the glass  right  and I would  sit there  and I had eaten  uh I had saved  a couple candy  bars that I  had bought  at the store 
[02:29:30]  I sat there  and ate them  on one side  of the glass  and she was  in a  overcoat  uh  doing her thing  god  let me ask you  were the guards  like that scene  in Goodfellas  come right this  way  come right in  don't wait  sign right in  here  come this way  Mrs. Hill  it's the girl  with the coat  come on  come this way  wow  you must have  been the king  after that  oh  that only happened  once in jail  yeah that did  only happen once  alright so after  you got out of  jail uh  what happened  when you guys  were living  together and stuff  well you know  it seemed like  she got more 
[02:30:00]  of a fever pitch  for this whole  thing  it was like  she doubled  her efforts  to make me  large  and I was  caught in the  trap of where  I was doing  what I wanted  eating good food  and having  great sex  well how  turned on  would she  get as  she watched  you eat  all I could  tell you is  you just had  to watch it  I mean  you just had  to see it  it was to  wear moisture  you know  I mean  I don't know  what other way  to put it  so she was like  yeah really  turned on  oh yes  and what was she  like a dynamo  like really  yeah she was 
[02:30:30]  a little 98  pound person  you spin her  like a helicopter  you know  spin her  like a top  which never  got to the  nine and a  half weeks  kind of thing  right  I kind of  wish it did  once in a while  but no  it did never  go that way  it was never  that kind  of food thing  did you play  like airplanes  coming in  for a landing  did you do  like stuff  like that  no because  I would have  been the  spruce goose  and I would  have probably  crashed  a Howard Hughes  reference  wow  how good are  you  take a couple 
[02:31:00]  of donuts  out of petty  cash  so when  did you decide  that you  had enough  well it was  1989  I had maxed  out at about  850  sex had stopped  about 300 pounds  ago  oh really  she just  gave up on you  well no  it just goes  away  you're not able  to  well yeah  she couldn't  find it  yeah it doesn't  function anymore  really  it functions  in one capacity  and that's  to urinate  that's it  oh you  couldn't 
[02:31:30]  sport  no chubs  well you  can but  not to  where it  was any  use  you know  it was  just  it was  too well  covered  up  undead  sexy  did you  lay there  look at  my sexy  body  no you  wouldn't  be saying  that  looking  in my  mirror  no  so the  sex  ended  and you  decided  to get  rid of  this  one  huh  well she  was  cheating  on me  with a  neighbor  upstairs  a normal  sized  guy  so at  that point  well that's  how we  started out  yeah  that was 
[02:32:00]  it  goodbye  yeah well  that's how  it starts  like a  stephen king  character or  something  it just goes  around  yeah  making guys  big fat  pigs  and then  ditching them  wow  you know what  dudes  I'll tell you  something  she did  this to a  guy  after me  there was  another guy  I ran  across her  like three  four years  later  I had  gotten down  to oh  about  600 pounds  I was getting  around  and I  came across  her again  and there  she was  she had  met a  guy  he was  about 200  when he 
[02:32:30]  met her  at that  time  and he  was probably  at about  six  oh man  is that  something  this chick  had a fetish  and she  didn't mind  going for  what she  wanted  is it also  true that  she got  abusive  when you  decided  you didn't  want to  eat as  much  oh yeah  you know  if there  was any  time that  I didn't  completely  finish  the  you know  half a  pack of  hot dogs  that she  would make  with buns  and you  know a  big bag  of Lay's  chips  and a  half a  gallon  ice cream  one time  in particular  I left 
[02:33:00]  two  hot dog  buns  at the  very  ends  okay  sitting  on the  plate  she came  home  from whatever  she was  out doing  probably  shopping  for more  and  she saw  these two  hot dog  buns  on the  end  of the  plate  she goes  what's  that  and I  go  well I  was done  you know  I had  you know  three pounds  of other  food  I don't  need  those  and  she just  walked past  me  behind me  a little  bit  grabbed this  cane  out of the  closet  or whatever  and next  thing I knew  I was getting 
[02:33:30]  whacked over  the back  of the head  with it  wow  what a  cook  at that  point  I was  about  800 pounds  and for  people  listening  you don't  you know  I mean  sure I  could have  grabbed her  broke her  like a  twig  then I'm  in prison  for life  what could  does that  do me  okay  at 850  you don't  just get out  and hail  a taxi  right  wow  that's what  I was  this is a  Stephen King  novel  eat it  eat it  look at that  if you have  his number  have him  get a hold  of me  yeah  wow 
[02:34:00]  yeah  I've never  heard of that  before  that's something  where is she  now  she lives  in California  out here  somewhere  I have no  idea  she's out there  with a short  skirt and a  butt cake  yeah  how did this  end up  ending  well  my story  hasn't ended  yet  we just  split up  it was to  the point  where  hey look  we're just  done  she was  in agreement  and we  just split  up  I got  on my  own  I started  eating 
[02:34:30]  naturally  I wasn't  naturally  a 12 hot  dog for  lunch guy  okay  I just  started eating  normally  you know  and I  dropped  down to  what I  am now  I've  actually been  lower  less than  what I  am now  but I'm  not because  of the  yo-yo  diet  thing  I'm at  a point  did people  you knew  just say  hey dude  what's  happening  to you  you're blown  up  oh my god  I had  friends  my parents  my mother  but the  whole thing  was so  controlled  by her  that understand 
[02:35:00]  this  anytime she  left the  house  all the  phones  were gone  I had  no way  of communicating  oh my god  wow  oh yeah  it's the  flip side  of abuse  you know  instead of  the man  abusing  the woman  it was  the woman  abusing  a man  in a  very  bizarre  way  I  understand  there's a couple  notes that  our producer  wrote down  there's a car  story  a car  story  air  conditioning  went nuts  oh yeah
