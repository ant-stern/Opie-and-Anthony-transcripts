<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic scene description: simultaneous Def Leppard and Justin Bieber concerts near their studio.  One host recounted a disappointing Def Leppard soundcheck featuring an unrecognizable new song, while another described Justin Bieber's secret visit to their building the night before.  The hosts then launched into a furious rant about Mark Wahlberg's exclusive promotion of *Ted* on Howard Stern's show, believing they were being snubbed after previously supporting Wahlberg on smaller projects. This fueled a broader discussion about their strained relationships with certain celebrities and publicists, expressing anger towards those they felt were ungrateful for past favors.  Roland, a staff member, shared their disappointment about both the Def Leppard and Mark Wahlberg situations.  They briefly, and vaguely, discussed the new season of *Louie*, avoiding spoilers.  The segment concluded with complaints about NYC-related annoyances: confusing parking signs, inefficient Midtown Tunnel tolls, and a new mayoral ordinance targeting cab drivers transporting prostitutes, sparking humorous debate on its interpretation. One host also alluded to a personal anecdote they chose not to share.

The next segment heavily criticized the *Rock of Ages* movie, focusing on disparaging remarks about the actors (Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis) and the film's overall quality.  They also expressed frustration over a perceived slight regarding a musical guest appearance, criticizing the unreliability of musicians. This transitioned into a scathing critique of Nick Walenda's Niagara Falls tightrope walk, mocking the mandated safety tether and contrasting it with genuine daredevil stunts (shown via clips) from figures like Evel Knievel.  A brief interview clip featured Nick Walenda expressing his displeasure with the tether.  Numerous anecdotes, some humorous, some tragic, about people falling over Niagara Falls were shared.  This segment was punctuated by a long, graphic, sexually suggestive, and offensive recurring bit involving "Uncle Paul," along with tangents about Jerry Sandusky, Justin Bieber, and Dan Quayle.  A caller, Todd, contributed anecdotes about Niagara Falls stunts.

The third segment juxtaposed a live broadcast of musical acts with the Jerry Sandusky trial.  The hosts criticized Def Leppard's brief, commercial-interrupted Fox News performance and contrasted it with Justin Bieber's popular show.  The Beach Boys' appearance was also mentioned. The Sandusky trial discussion dominated, featuring graphic and offensive descriptions of victim testimonies, particularly "victim number nine’s" account of forcible rape.  They discussed Sandusky's wife, Dottie's, alleged inaction and read and commented upon a portion of Sandusky's own writing describing his relationship with a boy, using similarly offensive language.  A caller's story about a 911 call over a sandwich was also discussed.  The segment included a brief interview with members of the Beach Boys.

The final segment started with a news story about Rother McLennan's 911 call about a bad sandwich. This led to a discussion about Bobo, a frequent caller blocked by several hosts on social media. Bobo called in with a joke about his girlfriend’s Cubs-win-dependent sex agreement and a story about his Russian neighbors.  A Brian Wilson interview clip played, followed by an extended discussion about E-Rock's bowel issues, especially a wedding incident involving soiled towels.  A sound clip of a profanity-laden L.A. Kings post-game interview led to a discussion about profanity in war, illustrated with helmet cam footage from Afghanistan.  A former Marine, Joe, called in to share his experiences. The segment concluded with discussions about Bobo's nakedness at Opie's house, Opie's Father's Day plans, wrestling, scheduling, and the show’s ending.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  How's everyone?  Well, it's a war zone outside. My God.  Good morning.  Between Def Leppard and Justin Bieber, you can't get around Midtown.  He runs the gamut of age, doesn't he?  Oh, boy. Def Leppard? 
[00:00:30]  Excuse me.  There's kids, mothers and daughters in fucking spandex leather and leopard skin.  There's a lot of people out there for them?  Well, let me tell you the difference because I kind of looked at the situation.  Justin Bieber, you can maybe get within a quarter mile of him right now.  No joke.  Yeah.  There are kids still showing up that won't even come close to even seeing the block he's on.  They're going to be all crying.  I almost mowed down like fucking ten of them on the way in today.  Anyway, so we got that going on, which is maybe, what, two blocks away? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Two long blocks, two city blocks away.  So it's a zoo out there.  And then competing with that is Def Leppard going to be on Fox.  And I walked right up to the stage to check out the sound check.  Yeah.  Literally walked up to the stage.  I said, you know what?  I'm going to check this out.  And they were playing some song that sounded very Def Leppard-y.  But I didn't recognize it. 
[00:01:30]  So I'm going to myself, oh, boy.  They're going to try out a new song, are they now?  This is one of our new songs.  How about you just play Pour Some Sugar On Me and call it a fucking morning?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  So that's what's going on outside.  Is it a we're back and better than ever type song?  You know what?  It kind of sounded like that.  Oh, God.  It was definitely the Def Leppard sound.  Was it chanting?  We're better ever.  It was just there. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  The whole time I'm waiting for the hook, like maybe they're reworking a rocket or a photograph.  Yes, one of their biggies.  And, man, it never got to anything I recognize.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So Def Leppard right outside our building and Justin Bieber two blocks away.  And Justin Bieber was in this facility last night.  Oh, was he?  What was he, sneaking around?  What the fuck was he doing in last night?  What time?  Oh, no one knew about it because it was a top secret mission, I'm finding out. 
[00:02:30]  I don't know.  He was in about 4 o'clock, and yeah, it was very...  Wait, were you here?  No.  I knew it was happening, though.  When did you know?  I found out around 1.30.  So why wouldn't you stick around to see the Biebs?  What the fuck do I care about the Biebs?  I thought it'd sign your arm and you'd tat it up.  That would be a great one.  I don't give a fuck about the Biebs musically,  but he's pretty much the biggest person in the world right now. 
[00:03:00]  I guess so.  So if he's at the place you work at, I would hang around just to see the nonsense.  I'd rather get home.  Really?  Yeah, I don't care about seeing it.  But no one knew about this till the last minute for whatever reason.  No, it was very, very hush-hush.  Very top secret.  They probably just did.  They probably, every time he comes, people probably bring their kids in,  and they probably wanted to get him in and out without having to do that.  Without dealing with that?  Yeah, I mean, if he's in a rush, honestly,  because it's probably hard for him to walk away from an 8-year-old who's crying. 
[00:03:30]  But you gotta...  Like Sandusky.  You mean the Tickle Monster?  Just call me the Tickle Monster.  I mean, it's not like we had Justin Bieber and I had a good time with him,  and he said he'd come back, but then decided to not come back and see us.  Ah, you're bothered by that one, too?  Be on.  I'm exhausted.  I can't fight the good fight anymore, people.  So, you know, applaud.  You won't hear me bitch anymore, because I'm done.  I'm so done.  So applaud, beep your horns, whatever you need to do, 
[00:04:00]  because the yopster is done bitching.  He's at it.  Is that it?  Oh, God.  I was thinking about it.  I was like, I've been at this since I was 18 years old.  I'm done.  I'm done with the bitching.  It doesn't get you anywhere anymore.  It used to get us places.  It did.  That's why I did it for so many years,  because I knew damn well it got us places.  Man, I might as well bitch to this fucking wall behind me. 
[00:04:30]  I was just telling the boys that I got some intel yesterday.  This isn't a bitch.  This is just info, I promise you.  I promise.  That Mark Wahlberg will not be doing our show.  Well, we did have a really awful time with him.  Last time he was in, it was, oh, that's right.  It went really well.  Well, to give you some back story, we're told by people in general that are in the know, 
[00:05:00]  that we're developing relationships.  We're developing friendships.  You bring these people in.  It's like, hey, man, if you take a phone from this guy, when he comes back, he'll come by and come in the studio.  Or if you take this who gives a fuck actress, then it'll lead to this guy.  You're just building friendships and relationships for the radio show.  Well, we did just that with Mark Wahlberg.  It started with phone calls, if you remember.  Right.  And the phone calls were great.  He had a good time.  He was laughing.  And then he came in here, and man, we hit it out of the park, I do believe. 
[00:05:30]  We had a lot of fun.  We had a real good interview with him.  Yeah.  Took a little boogie nights.  Found out yesterday that he's going to be promoting this movie, Ted, that I went to see last night, but it was at the wrong theater.  Oh, boy.  Roland had his info wrong.  Oh, Roland.  He was running like a lunatic, sweating, to get to the subway so he could go to another theater to go see Ted.  And he goes, you want to go?  I'm like, no, because my pet peeve is I can't go into a movie theater if the movie already started. 
[00:06:00]  I don't even give a fuck if it's two minutes.  There's something about it.  I don't like that either, yeah.  So I said, no, I'll go next week because I guess there's going to be another screening.  Long story short, I was seeing Ted because I assumed Mark Wahlberg was coming in.  Plus, it looks like a movie we all want to see, right?  Mm-hmm.  Roland goes, bad news.  Mark Wahlberg's not doing the show.  He's only doing Howard Stern exclusively. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, well.  And he said that he was told that Howard was a little pissed off that Mark only did our show last time.  So this is like a make good.  A make good.  Because if you remember, Mark Wahlberg pretty much only did our show.  Right.  For whatever reason.  Because he was probably off.  And all hell broke loose behind the scenes.  No, this is what I was told.  All hell broke loose behind the scenes.  So now Mark is now going to just do Howard.  And not us.  We just never did.  And not us.  Which is the stupidest thing in the world for Mark Wahlberg and his people. 
[00:07:00]  Not that I need to tell Mark Wahlberg what to do because he doesn't need to make another dollar in his life.  But if you are trying to promote a movie like Ted, this is the place.  No, but we get him for the charity.  This is the place.  He was promoting a charity when he came in.  Is that what?  That was when he came in.  He was promoting a charity, I believe.  Yes.  But when it comes to the big movie, we don't get him.  The same thing.  Happens with all of them.  As what's his name?  The guy who I liked would never ever vote to have yes again on the show.  The guy, Jonah Hill. 
[00:07:30]  Same thing.  We get him for this.  We don't get him for Moneyball.  These guys, these actors and they're publicists.  Right.  Maybe it's the publicists before the actors are just cowards and they're all terrified that they're going to be cast out.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm just telling you what I heard.  I know it's not him.  It's obviously that.  No, I don't think it's him.  Maybe it's not him.  Maybe it's the publicists.  Maybe it's Howard's people.  I don't know.  I'm just telling you what I was told last night as Roland was running away to try to catch the movie in Times Square.  And the company won't help us out by striking back at that publicist. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, obviously, why would they?  Because he is doing something on the platform.  This is great.  Jimmy has made me hate publicists.  I've never met one in my life, but I hate them.  Oh, they're glad.  I'm glad I've turned people on them.  They're the worst.  Oh, they're the worst.  They're the fucking worst.  Roland said we should absolutely complain about this one to whoever.  I don't know.  So, whatever.  But that's the info I got.  It's ridiculous.  You're right.  Jonah Hill, he came in here for what?  Who gives a fuck movie?  And then it was Moneyball Time, which he was up for an Oscar, I think. 
[00:08:30]  Wasn't he up for an Oscar himself?  Yeah.  He did.  I ended up getting that.  And then he wants to come by for the other bomb that he did.  Goodbye.  It's like, movie no one gives a fuck about, I'll see Opie and Anthony.  Movie that's doing real well, Oscar worthy, as they say.  Yeah.  Not doing Opie and Anthony.  Oh, back to doing another shitty movie.  I will go and see Opie and Anthony.  We're the whore.  You only come around when, you know.  So, Mark Wahlberg came in here to promote a charity. 
[00:09:00]  We did it.  We did it.  We did right by him.  Sure.  We turned a lot of people on to, you know, his good work.  And now this movie that's getting a lot of buzz, he's not doing the show.  It's just, it's exhausting.  You get sick of it after a while.  And I know people hate to complain, but it's like, God, it's frustrating.  It is, right?  It's like, it's almost like we don't blow up celebrity interviews or act like assholes.  And it's like, for what?  Why not?  Why not just be dicks to all of them?  They're not going to come back.  Right.  Fucking Russell Brand.  Oh, fuck Russell Brand.  It's like, we treated you nicely, you fucking twat. 
[00:09:30]  I hate that he's on that FX lineup because I fucking hate that guy.  But that lineup.  I don't worry about that too long.  But that lineup, you know, you got the Charlie Sheen, you got Russell Brand, you got Louis C.K.  They're building a little something something over there.  Yeah.  I saw the first two episodes of Louis' new show, by the way.  I know.  Did you see it?  I have the DVD.  I didn't pop it in yet.  I got the first five.  The first two were good.  You got the first five?  Huh?  What season?  This year.  Oh, no.  Three, okay.  Yeah, season three.  Cool.  We got an advanced copy that my doorman now has, and he will be distributing. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Louis is going to kill you.  I wish I could talk about the show, but I got to talk to Louis.  I don't know what he wants us to say.  Like, we get the show in advance, but now what do we do with it?  We just enjoy it.  I don't know if he wants us talking about it.  You just say, like, it's good.  It's edgy.  I like the first two episodes.  I just know Roland promised me, I believe, the first four episodes of Breaking Bad next week. 
[00:10:30]  Nice.  I am so goddamn psyched about that.  Movie theater.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  So what do I say about Louis?  The show looks good.  Yeah, you go, it looks good.  Uh, uh, I don't know.  Uh, yeah, I, I can't, there's some, I can't say nothing, I guess.  Damn it.  Well, you could say.  What could I say?  Was it, um. 
[00:11:00]  Ask me a couple questions.  Is it like the other seasons?  Yeah.  It could be vague.  Yes.  Just kind of throw a big blanket over the whole thing.  Uh, like the last, um, uh, is Louis kind of aloof?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little aloof.  All right.  I like aloof.  Aloof.  Going through, uh, life.  Trying to finish it out.  Right, right, right.  Does Louis date?  Uh, oh, yeah.  All right, Louis dates.  Oh, yeah.  That's all we need to know, really?  There's a great scene with, uh, a girl he was set up with.  By Alan. 
[00:11:30]  What's his name?  Alan Havy?  Yeah.  Alan Havy's in, uh, episode two.  He's a good actor, Alan.  He was in, um, what, some, uh, Tom Hanks movie, I think, with Tom Papa was in it, where  they played, uh, oh, what was the business, the George Clooney movie, I think, up and away.  I want to say Havy was in that as an FBI agent.  Or something.  I don't know.  Oh, oh, oh.  No, it wasn't.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no.  It was The Informant?  Yes.  Yes.  The Informant.  Yes. 
[00:12:00]  Was that a good movie?  Yeah, Alan's been a stand-up for a long time.  He's a veteran, and, uh, he's, he can be really cranky, like, like, which is funny.  I did Montreal with him years ago, and he was just fucking bitching at everybody, but  he was, it was very amusing, and, uh, he's a really good actor.  I was, I watched The Informant, um, and, and I was surprised to see Tom Papa in that.  I'm like, oh.  Yeah.  It's Tom Papa.  There's Tommy.  Yeah.  Uh, ask me more questions.  Uh, was, um, uh, did he, did he, uh, interact with his children?  Oh, yes.  He does.  All right. 
[00:12:30]  That's fantastic.  There's a Sandusky moment, which is really, uh, I like that.  Nothing on the Sandusky.  I don't know if you ever written on the truth or not.  Yeah.  He has soap battles with his kids in the shower.  It was innocent.  It was nice.  Uh, oh, that's good.  Questions now coming in from PalTalk.  Is he still bald?  Yes.  All righty.  Well, that's a good one.  We were trying to figure out.  He looks a little different. 
[00:13:00]  Uh-oh.  A little different.  Is he having work done, Mr. Hollywood, now?  I don't work.  I don't know.  We were looking and going, he looks a little different.  He did have work done.  He had freckles added.  Yes.  Not in a bad way.  Not in a good way.  Just looks different.  Just slightly different.  Yeah.  I would love to ask him about that.  He looks just a little different.  Yeah.  Maybe he cut his hair too short or something.  I don't know.  What else?  Um, let's see. 
[00:13:30]  Uh, did he lose weight?  Is that it?  Is that why he looks different?  He looks the same.  Yeah, he looks the same like that.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Does Louie have sex?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  See?  Louie having sex.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, he does.  Hmm.  And I think...  Maybe I wasn't paying attention.  I want to write this plot down that people will, you know, see for themselves very soon.  His ex-wife. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  His ex-wife.  What?  Exactly.  In the show?  Yeah.  That's odd.  Wow.  But...  People hate when we do this, but...  But...  Who plays him?  Yeah, yeah, that doesn't make any sense.  I got confused, so I think maybe I wasn't paying attention for two seconds.  That's fucking hilarious.  He might not have been paying attention.  But I think he might have done...  You know how he does shit?  Yeah, he's fucking insane. 
[00:14:30]  Like, he had a brother, Bob Kelly, and now no brother.  You know, he just likes to fuck around with shit.  He does.  He said he likes to, like, change things up like that.  But I think, if I saw it correctly, that...  Man, maybe...  And I would love to ask him about that.  Well, you know what?  See, that's why he can't give us episodes ahead of time.  He won't do our show.  Because it's too vague now.  He won't do our show.  No, he wants to be exclusive.  I don't blame him.  Down the hall.  Why would you do this shitty show?  This shitty...  No one likes this show.  I think because of our casual, relaxed vibe, people don't realize that we are actually 
[00:15:00]  talking to a lot of fucking people.  I know.  Because of the way we are in here, it's just kind of a hang when you walk in.  Right.  I think we don't...  They don't understand that we really do have a large audience.  Yeah, we're not just, like, fucking off just for the hell of it.  Yeah, I don't know.  The Mark Wahlberg thing is, like...  That's going to annoy me.  I'm in such a horrible mood right now, I can't tell you.  I was debating telling you.  Wait until after the show.  I was thinking, maybe I should tell Jimmy at 10.  Give him the weekend to mull it over.  I like Mark, too, man.  I liked him. 
[00:15:30]  We all have our things.  In one of my favorite movies, Boogie Nights.  Here it comes rolling down the hall.  Great.  He looks beaten already.  He looks...  Look at his head down.  His head's down and turns sideways.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  His head's totally down, turned sideways, and he's, like, shuffling down the hall, tapping  on the wall.  He ain't mad, is he?  I'm just...  Oh, man.  I'm just relaying what he told me.  He's not mad, no.  Here comes Roland.  Roland, you're not mad at me, are you?  Okay, good.  How was the movie?  It was fucking hilarious.  Ted was hilarious? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, Mark was amazing.  Joe McKellar was hilarious.  Yeah, I told the boys what you told me, so why don't you tell them, so there's no, like,  you know, telephone thing happening here to hear from you.  I know, just, Mark's coming to Sirius, to Howard and Rideau.  When's he coming?  Probably, I think, in two weeks or something.  Who said it?  Is that his publicist decision?  That's his deal.  I emailed his manager, and they said Mark makes his...  It was a decision made by his people, so...  How do you, like...  How do you know that that's exactly what went on? 
[00:16:30]  Wait, it was by his people and not his publicist?  Well, he doesn't have a publicist.  He has, like, managers and agents, no publicist.  So he's aware.  Might be, or just...  He's so aware.  Yeah, maybe.  He's become aware.  That's just...  Why...  How do you know that this is really the real deal?  Who told you that, yes, down the hall, they want him exclusively?  That I don't know, but you could...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Someone told you.  Well, you just...  Did you say Mark is coming in?  Did you Howard?  Right now. 
[00:17:00]  This is very vague.  Yeah, they.  Was it somebody here or somebody there?  Yeah, who told you?  His camp goes...  He's coming in.  He's coming right out.  Oh, it's his people.  You got it in an email?  No.  You did tell me we should bitch about this one.  Yeah, I mean...  Not bitch, but complain to the people behind the scenes.  Yeah, well, I mean, he complained down the hall when he...  Mark didn't come in for, I think, one of his movies, and then Mark came in studio,  the next film.  Right.  So, yeah.  It's just like sometimes...  Why are you taking it personally, Roland? 
[00:17:30]  I can see it on your face.  Wow, does he ever...  This has nothing to do with you.  I know, but then it always ends up, though, down the hall, like, why couldn't you get him?  What's going on?  Well, how about down the hall helps us?  How about...  This is the thing.  Down the hall doesn't punish publishers.  Who's down the hall?  I need people.  But sometimes, though, it's like actors, sometimes I'll pick Lenovo Letterman or...  That's true.  It's just like you can't...  Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't.  It just sucks.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  You make that up?  No.  It's a good one.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That's what we get. 
[00:18:00]  How do we write that?  Yeah, I know that one.  TM.  Oh.  TM.  Yeah.  Like, Joel wasn't going to come up, but he's on vacation that week.  He's not coming to New York.  Who?  Joel McHale.  That's fine.  Joel's been great.  We've had Joel a million times.  He's been great.  I love Joel.  Yeah, but Jesus.  Enough of Joel McHale at this point.  Mark Wahlberg.  That's a joke, by the way.  No, I'm kidding.  That was a joke.  We like Joel.  Yeah, he's really good in the movie, but...  But if you do, at least he comes in.  I didn't even know Joel was in Ted.  Yeah.  That's great for him.  He's a slimy boss.  No, my point is, Joel, I know where we stand with Joel. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  He will come in every single time to see us, when he can.  But the Mark Wahlberg, didn't he have a good time on the show?  Yeah.  It just...  Ah, fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck his...  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck them all.  Yeah.  See, I'm not bitching.  Fuck all y'all.  I was great.  I just say fuck to a charity.  That's where I was going with that, and realized, all right, calm down.  I reached out, saying, I go, can you at least ask him one more time before he comes in?  Nah, we don't need a bag.  We don't need any of these fucking guys to do a really good radio show. 
[00:19:00]  It's just the point of the whole thing.  You asked, you did your job, but they...  You know, you can't make the guy do it.  It comes from you.  And I don't want to.  I don't like...  It's like Russell Brandt, another one.  You know, I'm protective of comics for some reason, instinctively.  Yeah, whatever.  You just get that way.  But what a douchebag.  It's like, we treated that guy really well.  When he was coming up.  It was his first radio show, it was you guys.  And then he fucking won't come back?  Like, what the...  Man, what?  Yeah, what?  I would never do that to shows.  At least...  There's one show I couldn't do when I was in fucking D.C.  I forget why I couldn't do it, but they've been good to me. 
[00:19:30]  The Junkies.  There was something happening where I couldn't do it.  And I called their producer and said, tell those guys why.  I'm a person.  It's like, I apologize.  Right.  Like, I really like those guys.  Those guys treat me really well.  It's like...  People forget, Russell Brandt is huge now.  He was coming up.  He was...  You know, people didn't really know who he was.  And we had a great time with the guy.  And I even joked that we'll never see him again.  And he actually admitted.  He goes, yeah, you're probably right.  Probably won't.  And I thought at the time it was a joke, but... 
[00:20:00]  He was in twice.  Yeah.  He was in twice.  Okay.  The first time he came in with Jason Segel because he's new.  Right.  K-Rock, yeah.  He was completely new.  Yeah.  And he kind of pushed Jason Segel aside.  Jason didn't mind.  And he shined that day, I remember.  Yeah.  And then we had him on again.  And then that was it.  Yeah.  We never saw him again.  Yeah.  We had a nice talk.  Yeah.  But it's like they used this show as like a stepping stone into it.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah, but...  The bear doesn't get old, though.  Huh?  The bear doesn't get old in the movie. 
[00:20:30]  The teddy bear doesn't get old.  It's funny.  Did you just give away the whole fucking movie?  No.  How does that...  No, he means the humor of the bear doesn't get old.  Oh.  Yeah, he's a bear.  People are going to see the movie anyway.  It's like...  Wild would promote it.  You need an interpreter with Roland.  That would be a huge plot line that the bear never grows up.  Right.  Meaning the character, the bear.  You mean the bear humor that we were scared about.  Right.  You were thinking it was going to get old because it's kind of a one joke thing. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  You know, he's crazy.  You know what?  I'll go see the movie.  I'm not going to talk about it in the air, though.  Fuck that.  I won't even see it.  I don't care.  If that helps get just a few people, a few less people to the fucking theater, then I'll...  Then so be it.  Then so be it.  Obviously, the movie's going to do really well, but if I can knock that number down by 20 people...  Yeah.  I'll sleep well at night.  Fuck everyone.  That is just a dick move, man.  You've got to take note who these people are, so if they have somebody else, we'll start 
[00:21:30]  playing our games now.  When some who gives a fuck actress is coming through and, oh, just happens to be associated  with Mark Wahlberg's people, well, guess what?  That's how we'll do our payback.  All they have is, like, entourage people.  That's his company.  Well, no entourage people for us, ever.  Ever.  And some of those guys are going to have movies that they're going to need help with.  Fuck them.  Goddamn.  It's not your fault, though, Roland.  I know.  He takes his work very personally. 
[00:22:00]  You want a bacon sundae?  No.  Pizza?  What do you need?  No.  I'm good.  All right.  Now you're just bumming us out.  Could you get out of here?  Yeah.  You forgot to ask me if Louis wears black shirts, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Louis does like to wear the black shirt, doesn't he?  That would have been a good question.  He does like to wear that black shirt.  There is one scene where he's trying to figure out if he could park in a spot in New York 
[00:22:30]  City, and it has all the parking signs.  Something all us New Yorkers deal with.  Right.  Trying to fucking figure it out.  I could say that one, because it doesn't fuck up the plot.  And he's just trying to figure out if he could actually park his fucking car there.  It was brilliant, because we all go through that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a puzzle, because it's never just one sign.  You can't park, I don't know, Monday and Wednesday between 9 and 10 a.m. 
[00:23:00]  That would be easy to figure out.  Yeah.  The one sign in the show, it said you could park there after midnight.  Wrap your head around that.  You could park there after midnight.  What does that mean?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  After midnight.  Because isn't it like 2 in the afternoon after midnight, technically?  When does it not become after midnight anymore?  And it's an actual sign I have seen in New York, so he didn't make it up for his show.  That's hilarious. 
[00:23:30]  It says you can park here after midnight.  But it also says no...  Here's a typical one.  Can you make that bigger?  Please.  Please.  Here we go.  So when's after midnight?  So it starts...  This isn't the one from the show.  This is a different one, but, you know...  All right.  So it starts with no standing, 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. except Sunday.  Yeah.  Then the next one, no standing except trucks loading and unloading, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. except Sunday. 
[00:24:00]  So now you've got to put those two together.  What does that mean so far?  7 a.m. to 7 p.m.  You cannot stand.  So why wouldn't they make that in one sign?  Because they're scumbags.  Because they want to fuck you over and give you a ticket.  And they also sometimes change things, and instead of fixing the sign, they just throw another one on top to cover the extra three hours.  You could take that top sign off.  It's right there.  All right.  But when you see them all together, you get confused.  You're like, wait, no standing 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.  And say you're there at 10.30. 
[00:24:30]  You're like, all right, I'm good.  But then the next sign says no standing except trucks loading and unloading, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. except Sunday.  So now you're like, wait, now I can't park here from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  This is what you have to do.  Yeah.  And you'll figure it out eventually.  Then the next sign says hour parking 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday.  But it says you can't park there Sunday, the sign above it.  No, it says except Sunday.  No, not the white one.  Oh.  It says hour parking 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday. 
[00:25:00]  So you can park there for an hour at a time.  But the first two signs says you can't park there Sunday.  No, it's except Sunday.  You can park Sunday.  You can park Sunday.  Oh, okay.  So now we're down to you could park there.  This is what you have to do.  Yeah.  So now you could park there on Sunday for one hour at a time?  The meter's an hour, yeah.  Then there's night regulation, 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., including Sunday.  I don't even know what that means.  That's one of the signs.  Night regulation, 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., including Sunday. 
[00:25:30]  That's just one sign that we popped up.  7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday.  You can't park there.  You cannot stay there.  You can park there on Sunday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., but you can only park for an hour  at a time because that's how long the meter is.  Gotcha.  You cannot park there any night, including Sunday, from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.  So now you could park there from 1 a.m.  So on Sundays you could –  Which, by the way – 
[00:26:00]  Hold on.  So then you finally do the math problem.  So Sundays you could park there for an hour between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m., I believe.  So why don't they just say that?  Because isn't it saying also –  There's three signs basically saying that you cannot park there from 7 a.m.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wow.  Your brain blows up trying to figure this shit out.  And I was so happy Louis brought it to his TV show.  You know what that might mean?  Night regulation? 
[00:26:30]  You might be able to park, but it's an hour at a time.  I don't know what the fuck that means.  That's very confusing.  And this is just one example.  There's a million of them.  And it's a different combination on every street corner.  So when you have this combination figured out, you've got a new one you've got to figure out.  That's infuriating.  And the city does this because they just want to get you for illegally parking.  They're fucking you.  In the end, that's all they want.  They don't want to make it easy for you because that means less tickets. 
[00:27:00]  Is something going on with the tunnel people?  Are they trying to contract negotiations or something?  Are they trying to fuck everybody?  I came into the Midtown Tunnel up to the Toll Plaza.  There's a huge line of fucking cars everywhere.  They have one fucking E-ZPass lane open and a cash lane open and everything else, Red X, is closed.  It's early in the morning.  And we're in a giant traffic jam because they only open one fucking thing. 
[00:27:30]  And it's every morning, by the way.  One E-ZPass thing.  Why?  They could just turn the switch on and open the fucking thing.  Because they're trying to save money.  But the fact is...  How does that save money?  It doesn't save money.  Oh, one E-ZPass open.  Oh, I see.  Just open the...  I wonder if you need an extra person per each...  Per E-ZPass lane.  I bet their contract for their fuck union says that even though it's E-ZPass, you need a person for every E-ZPass lane that's open.  That's what I'm saying.  There has to be a person.  One of our guys in there. 
[00:28:00]  A monitoring it or whatever.  Oh, I bet.  You're probably right.  The amount of money that we spend commuting, every fucking lane should be open all the time.  Period.  It's just...  Yeah, just open all of them up and fucking let us drive through the goddamn thing.  I was so pissed this morning.  I was looking for someone to yell at.  Like, I had the window down and everything.  I was going to go, yeah, well, how about you open up a couple of fucking lanes?  But then I just decided to fly through.  Also, the people that stop for the gate to go down and then back up again, and then they stop for the gate to go down. 
[00:28:30]  Could you just stay on the guy's bumper in front of you and the fucking gate stays up?  Don't worry about it.  And if it comes down, it's not concrete.  It's a fucking cushy gate.  It doesn't fuck your car up or anything.  Well, why do they need gates still?  I don't know.  Jersey doesn't have gates.  Everywhere else, you don't need a gate.  In case you want to kill Sonny Corleone.  Yeah, exactly.  Finally, you see the tall guy just duck down.  That and nothing more infuriating than being in the left lane, looking five car lengths ahead of you, 
[00:29:00]  and seeing a guy with a shitload of road in front of him.  Right.  That happened so much this morning.  And then I go to pass him, and I look over, and it's just a dumb face.  It's someone's dumb face.  And they don't even look at you because they don't even know they're fucked up.  They just sit there, clinching the wheel with their dumb face.  Oh, it's that infuriating.  That was my drive this morning.  Very good.  Guy has a solution for the signs.  We don't need to go to him because there is no solution.  They want you to get all confused. 
[00:29:30]  They want you to.  Do you have one more example, and then we can move on?  What about that one all the way to the right?  Yeah, that one.  Is that a good one?  All right, let's try this one.  It doesn't look like you are.  This one has four signs.  The first one, tow-away.  No standing or parking, 7 a.m. to 9.30 a.m., 4 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  Monday through Friday.  I'm going to guess that's by a tunnel or a bridge.  Okay.  Because they do that to open the lanes around the tunnel or bridges.  They give you an extra lane where people park.  Yeah, just so you can't clog up the whole thing. 
[00:30:00]  So you got that one.  So you're like, all right, no tow-away between those hours.  And then the next one, two-hour parking limit in Zone 1, 9.30 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Monday through Friday.  Zone 1 permit holders accepted.  Huh?  I don't know what that means, but that doesn't affect our parking.  That one's pretty simple.  So far?  So far?  Yeah, the hours you can park there, it's a two-hour limit.  But then there's a third.  Why do they need four signs?  Third sign, no parking 12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. Thursday, tow-away zone, 
[00:30:30]  accept Monday's street cleaning, right?  Yeah.  Holidays.  Holidays?  Holiday.  I have no idea.  And then you don't even know which day is a holiday because there's a million different holidays now.  Right, right, right.  And then the final sign, accept 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. Friday.  That's all it says.  Accept 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. Friday is an individual sign.  I do.  I accept it.  I agree. 
[00:31:00]  It exists.  That's why I just hate the politicians in New York City.  They do this shit because they just want to fuck you over.  They want to give tickets.  It's a revenue stream.  I know I say that a lot, but it is.  It's a revenue stream.  Yeah.  They get people parking in that area all the time because they thought they could park there legally,  and they just nail you with tickets.  It has just become a revenue stream.  It's not even about clearing the roads or making traffic move better or anything like that. 
[00:31:30]  It's all like, it's just they figure it in now.  They figure it into their budget.  Alternate side of the street parking, they say it's because they need to clean the streets.  They need to clean the streets two, three times a week.  Stop.  They need everyone to move their cars from one side to the other side, and they know that people will just not move their car.  Not do it, so they'll make some money.  And they make money every fucking day with that shit.  You need to maybe clean the streets once a month.  No.  Right?  Yeah.  What could possibly go wrong with a street? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, fuck them.  A local street.  A little side street.  It's all bullshit, man.  It's bullshit.  You hear what the mayor's doing with the hookers and the cabs?  Hookers and cabs?  A lot of outrage.  What's going on now?  If you pick up a hooker and transport her to another part of the city, I guess this is something that cabbies have been doing.  I didn't even know.  I guess it's a real problem.  Wait, wait.  Do they knowingly do it, or is it like if a hooker is like, hey, I've got to get over here, and the cabbie doesn't even know?  I think it's a little side business some of these guys have. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, really?  They're knowingly doing it.  It doesn't affect me.  I don't give a fuck.  Okay, so a hooker will call a cab and say, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I'll call a cab driver and be like, man, I'm going to be here.  You know what?  Now you're asking questions I don't have an answer to.  Oh.  Oh.  You know the rule in this show.  I don't know.  Just enough info to make ourselves look intelligent.  So the mayor is trying to pass a new ordinance that if you're caught with a hooker in your cab transporting her, it's not good. 
[00:33:00]  $10,000 fine.  How the fuck do you know what she's doing?  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's what I was getting at.  And that's what they did at City Hall.  They had all these hot broads down there, basically saying to the mayor, but, you know, he probably didn't even notice they were hot.  Oh, God.  He certainly wasn't even looking at them.  Like, how do you even know who the hookers are?  Because a lot of women dress sexy to go out to the clubs or dress sexy for their other jobs, bartending and what's not. 
[00:33:30]  How's an ordinary slut going to get a cab?  So that's what the women are concerned with.  Now they're leaving these clubs or they're leaving their jobs late at night and none of these cabs will pick them up because they're scared of this new ordinance.  But it's a hooker.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there's going to be rapes galore.  The mayor is a dummy.  Just a douche.  The mayor's an idiot.  Right.  So I guess hooker cab problem.  So now women that are dressing sexy are not going to get picked up.  Yeah.  By a lot of these guys. 
[00:34:00]  I'll take care of them.  There you go.  Jimmy will take them.  Hop in, ladies.  Where are you going?  What if the cab driver picks up a girl, right, and she grabs his hand and puts it on her pussy and he gets to finger her?  Will he take her home now thinking that she's a hooker or just dump her there?  That is a damn good question.  Interesting.  They're not hookers.  They just look as they could be, the story goes.  Right.  A dozen scantily clad women rallied outside City Hall yesterday decrying, decreeing. 
[00:34:30]  Look at that big-titted monster.  A bill, they say, this font is way too small, Sambo, presents beauties wearing skimpy clothes from getting a fair shot at hailing a yellow cab.  The proposal, which will soon get Mayor Bloomberg's signature, slaps stiff penalties, get it, on cabbies who ferry prostitutes and get a cut of the cash.  So it is something that the cabbies.  Oh, right, okay.  So they're getting a... 
[00:35:00]  Get my hooker over here.  I'll give you a little taste.  Getting a little cut.  Get my hooker over here.  What do you mean?  Like, they're working as drivers for these?  Right.  Some of them are.  And I guess it's got to the point, maybe the word got out, hey, man, you could make a few extra bucks.  But wait, ferrying them from where to where?  From, like, escorts or street hookers?  It says the proposal, which will soon get Mayor Bloomberg's signature, slaps stiff penalties on cabbies who ferry prostitutes and get a cut of the cash.  And get a cut of the cash.  So there's something going on.  If you're getting a cut of the cash, you're not just dropping them off, obviously. 
[00:35:30]  Do they have drivers, a lot of these girls, that work security?  But maybe the prostitutes, again, with the cabbies, like, hey, man, can you pick me up in an hour?  Here's a little extra for you if you're around for me.  But, yeah, but you know what?  It may be, but in Manhattan, I can't see a hooker doing that.  It seems to be a problem that I didn't even know about because they're actually trying to pass a law.  They have to address the problem and who knew it was even there.  But you could never prove that.  Like, there's got to be another step that we're missing where something like they're letting them get blown in the back of the car. 
[00:36:00]  Or maybe the cabbies are letting stuff happen in the back of the car.  Yeah, because for a while, they had limos, right?  Just driving around with girls in them.  Oh, did they?  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  When I first moved to New York, and they would put the business cards on all the windshields down the side streets.  It was vague, but you knew what the fuck was going on.  It was a limo.  You call up and get a girl.  Limo pulls up, girls in the back.  Couple beautiful girls.  Keeping it all safe for everybody. 
[00:36:30]  No, I did not partake.  Like, fuck you.  I just heard a voice out there.  What else does it say, Sam, that we're missing?  Because I can't lean over and try to read that shit.  Yesterday's collection of bartenders and shock girls said the hacks will now be scared to pick up any women wearing a short skirt or spiked heels.  And noted that sometimes even legitimately employed women have to flaunt it to make a living.  Some of the bartenders show a little more cleavage.  Yeah.  Helps the tips. 
[00:37:00]  Hospice workers?  It's just...  It's just, you know, we go around this road a lot.  Our mayor's out of touch with real shit.  Yeah, he really is.  He really is totally out of fucking touch.  You drive around the city real late at night, you got women drunk on every corner with short skirts.  Why would they dress like that?  Who enjoys that?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't understand the attraction to that.  Anything else in there?  The fine is what, like $10,000 and you lose your license or something? 
[00:37:30]  The TLC would be forced to both strip a driver's license and slap them with a $10,000 penalty if he's been previously convicted of sex trafficking.  On first offense, a driver goes to a city hearing where his license could be revoked.  There's a step we're not aware of.  I don't know what it is.  Digging into the money issue.  Yeah.  And I guess the TLC is already aware of this problem and they take care of their own, but that wasn't good enough for the city.  I don't know what this one's about. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Every day with this mayor.  Yeah, yeah, that's weird.  Every day with this mayor.  Every goddamn day, right?  It's something weird.  What else is happening?  Like, if cabbies are just driving hookers around, why do you give a fuck?  But we're in trouble.  Why are we wasting any time on this?  Unless they can get fucking fines out of it.  I'm up to 10 years living here in New York City full time.  I never knew this was a problem.  Right.  Did you?  No.  And I love hookers.  And he loves hookers. 
[00:38:30]  Never heard of it.  If anyone should have known, believe me, I'm in the know.  So, like you said, what are we missing?  Because it's not like it's an epidemic out there.  I never noticed this shit was going on at all.  Mayor, obviously, they should have had a scantily clad young men, maybe, who get more attention.  Should look like the I'm still standing video.  That stupid video yesterday.  You know what?  That was great.  It's kind of brilliant on some of the listeners' parts. 
[00:39:00]  They actually synced up the videos yesterday.  Oh.  For the replay.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  So they wrote down what videos we were checking out, knowing during the replay they had them all ready to go.  Oh.  And they actually played along at home.  They said it was the greatest thing ever.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Well, then you get to see it and hear Ozzy yapping about it.  They said it made it so much better.  That was pretty smart on your part.  Adding a visual element?  Yeah.  They did it themselves.  Yeah.  They synced it up and then they could play along at home. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Does anyone know what's going on with this hooker thing?  I wish I knew, dude.  I'm driving me crazy.  What is the step?  Because you can't prove it.  If it can't be, it's just picking somebody up.  How can you prove anything?  You can't.  Yeah.  Very difficult to prove it.  All right.  This guy's going to try to explain.  Oh, boy.  I love when the listeners try to explain.  This will be good.  Let me make a prediction.  Okay.  This guy will give us what happens, right? 
[00:40:00]  Can I?  All right.  Because I want to add to it.  It'll sound logical.  It might sound logical.  Then a couple of minutes later, we'll get another call.  That'll be, this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  Dude's an idiot.  Bullshit.  That last guy said, it's nothing like that.  He's an idiot.  Here's what happens.  Then another guy will go, that's right.  I'd rather talk about Mark Wahlberg than Def Leppard.  Let's hear it.  Yeah.  Why don't we have Def Leppard?  Didn't we say yes to Def Leppard?  I know I did.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  We did.  Definitely.  Roland, come on back in here.  Tell us what's going on with Def Leppard.  They're outside.  We could see him from our window.  How come they can't hear?  Oh.  Here comes Roland.  Double sugar poise.  Here comes Roland again.  Chris, before Roland gets in studio, what's up?  I was going to say, it seems pretty basic to me.  Cabby picks the girl up, doesn't turn the mirror on.  He says, God, whatever it's going to be.  It's $25, $30.  The city's not getting the tax revenue off the cab fare. 
[00:41:00]  So it's about getting more money, right?  So it's just more money.  So now they're going to fuck up all these young ladies that are going to need cabs in the middle of the night when it gets dangerous out there.  That sounds logical.  That's smart.  That's smart.  Can't wait for the first one to get raped and then someone asked the mayor, well, see what happened?  I can't wait either because I'll be a part of it.  Now they'll take that clip and fuck me.  So trust me.  Listen closely.  Because now there will be problems.  Some poor lady that's trying to get a cab in a weird area is not going to get one because the cabbie's paranoid and then some animal's going to come upon the scene and maybe do some harm. 
[00:41:30]  I hope that doesn't happen.  Trust me.  But then I would love to ask the mayor.  See?  You dope.  You're out of touch.  Then again, if it's not about the meter's not being turned on, if you're just picking up a regular girl, you're going to turn the meter on.  So maybe it's not an issue.  Maybe that's an issue that the hookers are stirring up going, look, all these girls are going to get raped, when the reality is they're not going to because the meters, I don't know, if this guy's right.  Yeah, but I think if you're a cabbie, you know, this is hanging over your head, you're going to be like, fuck that. 
[00:42:00]  I'll just try to find somebody else to pick up.  Well, that's it.  Is it worth pulling over to pick some hot chick up if you've got a cop right behind you who's going to try to, you know.  Do you really think that's going to happen?  A cop is going to pull someone over for picking up a hot girl, sir?  I don't think so.  Hey, you, with the girl in the short skirt that you picked up, pull over.  I don't see that happening.  Boy, a hot black chick doesn't have a shot.  Now she's walking home.  I would assume the NYPD doesn't want to deal with this nonsense, but there will be some cabbies that are a little scared. 
[00:42:30]  Thank you, Chris.  Hey, have a good day, boys.  We need a task force.  I used to drive a cab from Philly and hookers would tip real well if they had a good night.  And if they didn't, then they would offer services to get home.  How about that?  That's a nice perk.  Roland, what's going on with Def Leppard? 
[00:43:00]  That's what you want, too, is end of the night hooker.  Jesus, what a disaster that's got to be.  Big open mouth kisses, please.  Cuckled cab.  That's why Ben Bailey left, because they wanted to change the cash cap.  He's like, I'm not doing that.  Wait, he left that show?  Yeah, I think he got tired of it.  I don't know.  I actually don't know the details, but he was very good at it.  Yeah, yeah.  He was really good at that.  Fucking won Emmys, dude.  Fucking Ben Bailey won Emmys.  Out of nowhere.  That's cool. 
[00:43:30]  Good for him.  So I'm sure he'll get another gig.  What's going on with Def Leppard?  If this was easy, you said no.  We said no.  We said yes.  You said no.  He said yes.  You're like, yeah, I don't know.  Maybe.  I said yes.  I said I wanted them to play.  They weren't going to play.  I said they were only going to come in and talk.  He went, eh, eh.  Yeah, we definitely wanted them to play.  Yeah, and I said they're only going to be here to talk.  He went, eh, forget it.  Yeah, I still stand by that.  Yeah, I would talk to them.  Why couldn't they have an acoustic guitar in here and play a couple things?  They are playing next door.  They're playing for next door.  Yeah, they're playing Fox.  I didn't say no, no. 
[00:44:00]  That would have been good.  We wanted them to play.  I would have liked them to play.  Yeah.  They were going to play in the morning.  Yeah, they are playing with Fox.  Why won't they come out and do one song here?  One acoustic guitar.  You pick it up, you play a goddamn song.  And you did say that to me.  You said they don't play in the morning.  But they are playing outside.  They probably get a deal there.  So I don't know.  You know what we could do?  When they play, we'll just pot up the fucking TV.  It's like, hey, we got Def Leppard here in studio.  Perfect.  That's what we're doing.  We'll just fucking steal their show.  I didn't say no, no, Rowan.  Was it a no, no? 
[00:44:30]  Or was it a no?  Or was it a no, no, no?  It was a let's try to get them to play.  They've played a million radio shows.  Exactly.  And they're playing outside.  What's the big deal?  I go definitely.  So I can decode your definition code.  Say yes or no.  They'll get them.  Oh, look.  He's up in arms today.  Then I go, all right.  Hey, if you're in a bad mood, that's one thing.  Don't fuck with me.  Oh, shit. 
[00:45:00]  I told you what I said.  So don't twist my words.  I said I would love to have Def Leppard in if they would play.  That's not a no.  That's a real thing.  Oh, shit.  And if they chose not to play, that's their business.  But that's exactly what I told you.  Don't go.  I would never go against you.  I said, you know, if they want to come in just to talk, I don't know if I want that.  I said I would like them to play.  That's exactly what I told you.  And that's how they just wanted to come in and talk.  And they are playing across the street.  So it's not that far-fetched.  At Faux News. 
[00:45:30]  At what?  They call it Faux News.  F-A-U-X News.  Man.  We get it.  Because even Lee's got pitched the same thing to come around and just talk only.  There's three of them, right?  Yeah.  What about Bieber?  Is he coming in?  We've done the talking with those guys.  You know, what would it be?  Joe is a funny guy.  I like Joe.  Yeah, that's why I said, you know.  I know they came in twice and they only did talk.  And I think it would be cool if they did a little acoustic.  Even if they did what Tommy Shaw did.  Tommy Shaw had played like 30 seconds of shit just to fool around a little bit. 
[00:46:00]  That's what I said, Roland.  Yeah, that is true.  I remember that.  That was good.  I apologize.  Tommy Shaw was good.  Are you?  You were very good.  Yeah, I was fucking great.  Because of the Mark Wahlberg thing?  Yeah.  This is a wonderful day.  What is it?  What's wrong with this?  What's wrong with this?  What's wrong with today?  Nothing.  It's fantastic.  You do an amazing job for us.  That's right.  It's good.  Why do you take it so personally?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  Uh-oh.  I'm good.  What's going on?  I don't know.  Nothing. 
[00:46:30]  He's in a tizzy today.  We've had nothing but great guests.  Everyone's talking about the great guests we've had on the show.  I'm good.  Tizzy.  I'm fine.  Sammy's not fine.  He's definitely not fine, though.  I'm fine.  No.  I saw you walking down the hall.  Your head's down.  It's tilted to the side.  You actually fell into the wall.  You're shuffling.  Exhaustion.  You're shuffling.  From what you're dealing with.  What are you dealing with?  You're worried that you're not booking enough guests?  We have a lot of guests on the show. 
[00:47:00]  They're terrific.  And then there's other stuff that goes on after the show.  And you're just like, sweet Jesus.  What happened?  What happened after the show?  That I can tell you on the air.  Oh.  Ass rape.  See, I knew there was something else going on here.  This one, I really can't do it on the air.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Can you write it down?  Yeah.  Write it down.  Oh, you won't even do that.  No.  Write it down.  Well, let's go to break.  Oh, boy.  Look at you. 
[00:47:30]  My eggs are here.  I have a fucking raging heart on.  Oh, no, look.  Don't ask me why.  I like eggs.  Where's Josh when you need him?  That's when you need to bring out Josh.  Sometimes a man's body turns against him.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  When you get a heart on, you're going to turn it to Josh.  Josh likes to get close to people.  Yeah, that makes it really go away, though.  Roman, I love you.  You know that.  We're pals, but don't say that shit.  I told you exactly what it was.  Oh, boy. 
[00:48:00]  I did tell you exactly what it was.  I thought it would just be cool to have him play.  That's all.  That's all.  And I'm only one guy.  If these guys still wanted him to just talk, then we could have worked that out.  I think I recall I wanted him to play, too.  That would have been nice.  I did want an acoustic guitar or something like that just come in.  Because it's so easy for them, you know?  It's not a difficult thing.  It's so silly if you're trying to promote something to not just, you know, kick it up there for the guys that you're hanging with.  Unless, and this is something, unless they don't feel like they sound good acoustically. 
[00:48:30]  But some guys...  I think they do, though.  I know they do.  Maybe, but you never know.  The singers are fucking flakes.  And sometimes, I'm, again, totally playing devilish, but he may think, eh.  And he's playing, like, live right now across the street.  But they're plugged in.  Some guys are afraid to play acoustic guitar.  Honestly, even though I didn't recognize the song, I hope they don't go down that road.  Just play your hits for Fox.  What are you doing?  They sounded good.  That's very big because of, I guess, Rock of Ages. 
[00:49:00]  Is that what they're, because they're very, you know, that was a song, for the fuck's sake.  That looks fucking great, by the way.  Rock of Ages.  You see the trailer for it?  Yeah.  God, it fucking looks...  Oh, my Jesus Christ.  What a bunch of shite.  Yeah.  Yes!  Yeah.  Is Jack Black in that?  That guy cracks me up.  Is he in it?  I don't know, but he cracks me up.  I don't know if Jack Black is in it.  Russell Brand is.  Of course.  Fuck him.  And Tom Cruise is in that?  Oh, yeah, he is.  He's the star. 
[00:49:30]  He's the star.  How do they cast Tom Cruise as, like, the rock singer guy?  Because he's a fucking rock star.  He's Tom Cruise.  How does Tom Cruise...  Look, he's all ripped and everything.  He's Tom Cruise.  How does that happen?  And the fucking chick from goddamn Top Gun looks like an old grandma.  I don't know.  Oh, my gosh.  She was...  You know, I watched that again recently.  She wasn't that hot then.  She wasn't.  But back then, we thought she was.  No, they just dollied her up for that movie.  She never looked like that in real life, I bet you.  No, they gussied her up.  She's like, makeup.  She's married to a woman. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  She's gay.  Yeah, she just got married.  Mary J. Blige.  No, no, she didn't...  No, it wasn't J. Blige.  She married someone else.  Oh, you could call me Ray J. Blige.  Married?  Married J. Blige.  She's married.  Damn it.  I did one play.  When you see Chris's girlfriend as a other co-star.  What?  When you see Chris?  Is this going to be a big movie, Roland?  Probably for New York and L.A.  Yeah?  That's where they're all...  You don't think the Midwest is going to be,  I'm going to watch me some queers singing on the stage.  That's probably no.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Is this like a Glee thing?  No, it's a musical.  Yeah.  So it's Glee.  So it's Glee.  He goes, is this like a Glee thing?  And he goes, no, it's a musical.  Well, Glee is not the first musical.  Well.  No, but it's Glee.  It's an actual musical.  It's Glee with rock and roll, I think.  I couldn't imagine going to a movie that's a musical like that.  I know.  The other big movie this weekend is That's My Boy,  so maybe big for rock and roll.  That's My Boy got a shitty review in one New York paper  and an okay review in the other.  Two and a half stars and one star.  On our papers. 
[00:51:00]  But Colin Quinn said he liked it.  Colin actually, yeah, he said it to me just at the cellar.  And Andy Samberg was great, though.  So, yeah, he was fun, man.  I didn't see the movie.  I had no idea.  We didn't get to see that one ahead of time.  Roland, I'm going to hug you, you know.  Yeah, Roland needs a hug.  It really does.  No, I'm going to hug you.  Something else is bothering him.  I'm going to hug you, but I'm going to keep it personal  between me and you.  I'm not going to do it on air.  But we're hugging.  I'll do it on air.  We'll just find out who is responsible for Roland being this upset.  Can you take a hug from Jim Norton first?  Sure.  All right, but it's got to be a side hug. 
[00:51:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, yeah, because he's got a boner.  Oh, do you feel it?  Did you feel it?  No, I know.  Jimmy's not.  No, I would never rub my rod on another guy.  Unless they had a dress on and I was paying him.  All right, Roland.  I don't know who else wants a hug.  I don't know who else wants a hug.  Roland.  You really don't like Josh?  No, I hate him.  I know it's a terrible character and the listeners don't like him. 
[00:52:00]  It's horrid.  It really makes me happy.  I hate him.  Oh, thanks.  You just want six more months of Josh.  Rocky Bages, you're going to go see this, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  It just looks so good.  I love a good musical movie.  Really?  Is Scarlett Johansson in that?  No.  No.  That's Julian Hough.  Wow, why don't you look kind of not there?  The one scene.  Ah, whatever.  I'm too shabby.  I'm an idiot.  I'm too shabby.  All right, Roland.  Sorry for the outburst.  It's just a little intense in here today.  I guess we're all pissed about the Mark Wahlberg thing. 
[00:52:30]  I don't blame you.  You don't blame us, right?  No.  Yeah.  Bullshit, but.  It's got to be exhausting.  You work hard behind the scenes to develop this shit and then they just like throw you  to the side.  Yeah.  Like it's nothing.  It's unbelievable.  Boy.  And then the book is up saying, yeah, no problem.  Next time.  Next time.  Next time.  We just got to say no.  That ain't happening next time.  I know.  We just got to say no.  We don't need Mark Wahlberg that bad to play that game.  I got my boogie night signed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There will not be a next time for something that no one cares about. 
[00:53:00]  Nope.  That ain't happening.  All right.  We got Jerry Sandusky shit after the break.  Yep.  I want to talk about the tight rope walker.  Oh, that awful thing.  Oh.  Um, it's ridiculous and we'll explain next day there.  The opening of the show. 
[00:53:30]  Good morning, sexy.  Oh.  Good morning.  Oh.  Did we want some vocals?  I never know if we're going to get vocals.  Sometimes it just loops.  I'll shut up now.  I think you hurt the show.  I do what you have up to.  I'm taking advantage while you hang me out to try.  But I can't see you every night. 
[00:54:00]  I like this.  Fuck yeah.  God damn.  Damn.  Damn.  I'm standing on your line.  I do.  I like that one. 
[00:54:30]  What's on your mind today, E-Rock?  Are you pissed off at the Mark Wahlberg situation?  That's, you know, it just sucks.  We're not going to get him.  We're not going to get Seth McFarlane.  We're not going to get anybody.  Why are we going to get Seth?  We've had Seth on a bunch of times, too.  Yeah, but it's always been on the phone.  He never comes in studio.  And when he's in New York, we never get offered him. 
[00:55:00]  So, how's this time going to be any different?  True.  What else is going on?  I heard something in your voice.  What else is bothering you?  No, nothing really.  What else is bothering you?  I know what's going on.  What's going on with you, E?  I wanted to meet Seth McFarlane.  When's he going to be in?  I'm a big fan.  Aw.  Aw.  Oh, sure.  You must have eight things for him to sign.  I think what he's saying is, he might be saying that Jimmy gets a few things signed. 
[00:55:30]  He's right.  So, what?  Bleach, Nirvana, how many years ago?  Well, for you children of the 80s, 23 years ago.  Jesus.  Are you serious?  Wow.  That's a while ago, huh?  I'm doing the math now.  89?  That's crazy.  89?  That should be crazy.  I was in Buffalo.  Damn. 
[00:56:00]  No, I was packing my car to go to Buffalo, I think.  Yeah, whatever.  89.  I would have went with Dan Quayle myself.  Today was the big potato day.  Was today potato day?  Wow.  Okay.  And the reason why I would have went with it is because it's 20 years.  It's one of those, you know.  It's a benchmark.  It's a benchmark.  It's rounded off.  That was 20 years ago when he fucking did the potato and 20 years ago.  He walked up to the chalkboard to correct the young child. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, my God, you idiot.  Makes the kid have an E to potato.  Well, there's one little thing I forgot at the end.  Did anybody tell them in that moment?  I don't think they did in that moment.  Wow.  What an embarrassment that was.  They killed him for that for a long time. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, they killed him with everything.  Dan Quayle was a douche.  Wasn't the brightest.  No, he was constantly fucking up.  God, that was 20 fucking years ago.  20 years ago.  One of the top awkward political gaffes of all time.  Gaffes.  What was number one?  I see 10 most.  10 most.  10 most.  10 most.  10 most.  Oh, the guy sounds like a guitar.  Oh, Clinton completely out cold. 
[00:57:30]  Bush vomiting, I think, would be the biggest on the Japanese premiere.  Clinton's trying to keep his chin up.  And then he starts nodding his head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you got Bush.  I speak to the nation.  Whatever you want to call it.  I love that guy.  Chuck Graham, state senator, is here.  Chuck, stand up.  Chuck, let him see you.  Oh, God love you.  What am I talking about?  I tell you what.  You're making everybody else stand up, old pal.  He's in a wheelchair. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, he's in a wheelchair.  I tell you what.  Stand up for Chuck.  Recently, I received a letter from Masayasu Okimura.  Oh, damn it.  Too many good docs are getting out of business.  Too many OBGYNs aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country.  We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.  And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the White House.  How did that work out for you? 
[00:58:30]  It is just wonderful to be back in Oregon.  And over the last 15 months, we've traveled to every corner of the United States.  I've now been in 57 states.  I think one left to go.  In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian Americans moving from India. 
[00:59:00]  You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.  I'm not joking.  Ah, good for you.  They fucked up.  They missed the Bush vomiting one.  Yeah, Bush vomiting.  Well, that video just sucks because the guy felt like he had to put Green Day over the whole thing.  And Kennedy, what he did in Dallas, his show-off move.  Yep.  Yep.  Where he went to brush back his hair and he...  Spilling his brains all over the trunk. 
[00:59:30]  Political gaffe.  Yes.  Political gaffe.  Whoopsie.  Those are more whoopsies.  So we got a guy who's going to tight, tightrope walk across the NFL.  Yeah.  It's just awful.  But a few people pointing out on Twitter what a joke this is because this is something ABC's doing.  Can we put ABC on, by the way, so we can check this out?  Are they doing it today, yeah?  Yeah, today.  I think they're starting some kind of summer series. 
[01:00:00]  Put it on, like, up there, too.  Like, the top stupid MSNBC channel.  Yeah, put it both places, the boss says.  Don't look at those fucking...  Stop lollygagging.  Make Mars to it.  Guys that look like girls and girls that look like guys on MSNBC.  Anyway, they're starting some kind of summer series called Stunt Summer.  I forgot the name, whatever.  And I think they're going to do a few of these stunts throughout the summer.  Oh, really?  And this guy, he's part of the famous tightrope walking family.  The... 
[01:00:30]  The Wellendas.  The Wellendas.  The Great Wellenda.  So, he agrees to do this walk for ABC.  And then ABC got involved and said, well, we want you to do this, but we want you to be tethered.  And the guy basically has said, I think we have the clip here, he's never tethered a walk in his life.  No.  Why would...  And my point is, it's not a stunt if the guy's tethered.  That means any one of us could go up on that rope.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Travis...  Any one of us.  That's not a stunt because it's a Six Flags ride.  Yeah.  It's like just a Six Flags ride.  So, what's the big deal?  Yeah.  Then don't do the stunt thing if you don't allow these guys to do it properly.  Right.  And then you brought up a great point before the show.  Of course I did.  What?  Wide World of Sports.  Oh, when we used to watch Wide World of Sports.  Evil Knievel and all this shit.  Yeah, when they would do stunts, it was like, you know, the Joey Chitwood stunt team is going  to take a car and try to jump it over buses and fucking crash.  Right.  And then, yeah, Evil Knievel, they would show him. 
[01:01:30]  But they took their precautions for the time, but there was still a chance that the person  could fuck up and die.  And that's why you watch this stuff.  Yeah.  So, why would you watch this dumb thing if the guy's tethered?  And the guy's pissed.  He's like, I don't want to be tethered.  He broke every bone in his body, Evil Knievel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For our enjoyment.  Yeah.  The one where he goes over the front of the handlebars to this day, and then the bike  is just following him and just crushing him.  The fountains at Caesars.  Amazing. 
[01:02:00]  Have you seen this, Sam?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, this is the one where...  Carl.  Well, Carl takes a fucking...  Does the old dipsy doodle header.  Carl should have fucking retired, huh?  Oh, oh, Carl.  Grab, grab, Carl.  Grab, Carl.  Oh, he never quite makes it.  Oh, boy.  Where was that, by the way?  In Mexico, I think.  Mexico?  I think.  Ay, caramba.  Is that him walking away from it?  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody runs up and just goes like, oh.  Too late to run.  Too late.  Maybe he should have started running as he's wobbling and try to catch him.  Well, the thing was, didn't he try to hold the stick or something? 
[01:02:30]  Like, he should have dropped...  Yeah, yeah, he should have just dropped the stick and bumped for the...  I think he didn't know what to do with the stick, because it's so big and long,  and you've got to dump it one way.  He just panicked.  He was 73, and it was in San Juan.  Was that his last, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  He retired after that.  He retired, okay.  He retired.  San Juan is where?  Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico.  San Juan.  All right, well, here's the guy himself talking about this...  Ted Walenda.  ...this fake stunt. 
[01:03:00]  Clapping crowds cheered for Daredevil Nick Walenda, who, for six days, has practiced walking 1,200 feet without a safety net, without a safety harness.  My dream is to walk without any tether whatsoever.  Again, I think it's more about family history, and I've never in my entire career worn a safety line.  Now, there's a growing controversy over that exact feat.  Walenda being tethered to the 1,800-foot cable over Niagara Falls has become a major sticking point for his sponsors. 
[01:03:30]  He won't say who they are, but, Walenda says, it's also become a major sticking point for the network that he signed with to broadcast this walk live.  Walenda says contracts were signed between he and his sponsors.  Now, he says, some are suddenly coming back to the table for liability reasons.  Oh, again, the fucking lawyers.  This totally makes sense.  Of course.  Lawyers have fucked up entertainment.  Of course.  You know what they've done to us at this point.  Of course, that's what it is. 
[01:04:00]  We grew up in an age where this shit was on TV, and the person could die.  Right.  It's gotta be tethered.  Then don't do your stupid stunt, fake stunt week.  Or sign away and promise not to sue.  Yeah.  Dumb lawyers again.  Here's what it is, too.  It's probably not even him and the station.  It's the station's lawyers, believe me.  But it's probably the lawyers came back and said, well, you know what?  If anything happens, we'll probably be sued for broadcasting something that fucked somebody up, that affected them. 
[01:04:30]  Like, imagine how many lawsuits would come in.  I was watching, and when he fell, it affected me, and I can't sleep now, and I'm suing ABC.  See, it's more of that overthinking shit.  Litigious.  Overthinking stuff that might happen.  That's what shut us down from anything.  The possibility that something might happen.  I refuse to use a net, Gregory.  Ted.  I refuse to.  I'm Ted Wallenda, and I'm the greatest tightrope walker in this part of town, at least. 
[01:05:00]  Are you going across Niagara Falls?  I most certainly will not do that.  I get very frightened when I see lots of water.  But I like to keep, I go a couple of feet above the ground, 30 feet in length, and I'll go right across.  Once in a while, I'll take the old Dipsy Doodle fall.  Dipsy Doodle.  What's your greatest walk?  My greatest walk is when I go to the side, or sometimes I'll just kind of put my crotch on the rope and guide myself very quickly across the rope.  What do you walk across? 
[01:05:30]  What's that?  What do you walk across?  A cement barrier.  A cement barrier.  It's only two feet wide, and I have it built, and I walk across it with my arms flailing wildly.  It doesn't really sound that dangerous.  It's very dangerous.  If there's not a lot of wind, my friend walks next to me with a fan and blows it on me.  It keeps me cool.  So you don't believe in being tethered.  And I would never tether myself, except unless I was very high, then I probably would. 
[01:06:00]  I don't want to fall and hurt myself, Gregory.  I don't know why they put it between buildings.  That's very high, you're going to hurt yourself.  Well, that's the whole thrill of it.  That's not the thrill of it.  I like to know that I'm going to be fine.  I'm going to do a walk.  I'll talk to you in about two minutes.  Bye-bye.  I've fallen 71 times.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Yes, I even spilled my coffee once.  You required your coffee?  I scalded myself, I certainly do. 
[01:06:30]  I get thirsty up there.  Up there?  How high up are you?  Sometimes between 35 and 45 inches.  Wow.  But it requires great balance with the fan blowing in my face.  Right.  And a cup of coffee in one hand.  And a cruller in the other.  How wide's the rope?  I have a two-foot cement thing built.  Thing.  Two feet.  It's two feet wide, but God knows what could happen.  Yeah.  I don't think he's doing the walk until 8 o'clock tonight. 
[01:07:00]  Oh!  Josh and Sam will continue to bring us.  Josh and Sam!  All the excitement.  And also this morning, a reality check on the popular reality show.  Wait, did he start?  No, it keeps doing it.  Then what was that?  I think he was practicing.  I don't think they're doing the walk until 8 o'clock tonight.  What a bust, man.  ABC looks stupid.  You got a guy that, you know, this is what he does for a living, and he doesn't want to  be tethered, and you're forcing him to be tethered.  Then he should not do it.  To keep it safe.  Yeah, I would have said, fuck you.  And then do your own walk somewhere else.  Let's say he does fall off the wire, and the line is there, and he's being held up by 
[01:07:30]  the wire.  What are they going to say?  Like, oh, wow, boy, if he didn't have that.  Right.  Then we'd have something.  That would have been, wow.  That would have went viral.  Now it's just, it is.  And then when these guys fall, they kind of, for the most part, know how to, you know,  grab onto the wire, right?  Oh my God.  I don't know.  That would be creepy, though.  Is it ABC, or are the sponsors making him do it?  I heard, this clip's a little older, but it has everything we need. 
[01:08:00]  The, what I heard this morning, the sponsors are ABC.  They're sponsoring the walk.  Oh, so it's ABC is their lawyers.  It's absolutely their lawyers, yeah.  Let me play the rest of this.  He doesn't need to be tethered to the cable.  It inhibits me in some ways to be able to have that freedom up there.  And I'm not used to wearing one.  So it's something else that I've got to get accustomed to as well in order to, uh, to  make this walk. 
[01:08:30]  For now, we'll end it.  We'll continue to walk the wire without a harness.  I didn't change two laws in two countries over a hundred years old to not fulfill my dream.  That's too bad.  And the funny thing is he'll probably fall because he's tethered because he's not used  to that extra whatever would be to him.  It would be great if he, the second he steps on the wire, just unclips the tether and just  goes.  How great would that be?  That would be pretty fucking cool.  That would be, that's what a rock star would do.  Yeah, but they'll have it in the contract.  You don't get paid if you do that.  Or when he does it to punish him, they'll shake the wire. 
[01:09:00]  Hey you, get off of that.  Yeah.  It's kind of embarrassing for ABC, I think.  I really do.  It really is.  Because there's no, there's no risk.  None.  Oh wow.  This is the boy's.  What?  It's the boy who was set on fire.  Oh, maybe that's different.  Okay, forget it.  I was watching a Niagara Falls special last evening, and it was people that have gone  over the falls either intentionally or accidentally, and wow, really fucked up. 
[01:09:30]  People are stupid.  What was the last one?  Only a couple years ago, right?  Yeah.  I asked it before the show, but I'll make believe.  Oh yeah.  Did you see Jet Ski Guy?  Yeah, the Jet Ski Guy from, was that 95, somewhere around there?  I felt like I was, I felt like I was in Buffalo doing radio when that happened.  I thought I was, but maybe not.  I think it was like 95.  I was out of Buffalo by 95, but a guy decided to take a jet ski over the, and I don't think 
[01:10:00]  he was trying to kill himself.  No, he had this rocket propelled parachute rig, right?  And he's on the jet ski, and he was going to ride the jet ski right off the edge of the  falls, and then hit this rocket pack thing that was supposed to propel him away from  the falls, and all those sharp, jaggedy rocks below, and then the chute would come out,  and he'd parachute gently down.  What a great stunt.  A great stunt, if anything worked.  The jet thing didn't work, his parachute didn't work, and...  And he did a dipsy doodle.  He did a dipsy doodle. 
[01:10:30]  It can only be described as a dipsy doodle.  Oh yeah, did he fucking die?  He did a header into the rocks, I believe.  Oh, did he fucking die?  Anyway, and then there was a family that is responsible for a lot of the rescues around  that area, the Niagara Falls area, and two of the sons of the father that did a lot of  the rescues decided to go over the falls.  What?  Yeah, one in a...  He took a bunch of tires, inner tubes and shit, and blew them up, and then covered them 
[01:11:00]  in some mesh netting, and went right in the middle of the tires, and went over the falls.  That's smart.  How did that work out?  Oh, well, he was catapulted out like toothpaste when it hit the rocks at the bottom, and  immediately killed.  Another dumb motherfucker decided to go over in a kayak.  Kayak guy.  Maybe kayak guy was when I was up there.  He took a kayak...  What year was that?  ...right over, and they never recovered him, but they recovered the kayak, which looked like  a pretzel, when he was done.  They never recovered him.  No. 
[01:11:30]  Aren't there only a couple people that have done it successfully?  Like in barrels or whatever?  I think 15 people have gone over, and...  That is?  Yeah, and I think 10 have survived.  Oh, I thought...  The first one was some old bag.  Yeah, back in 1901.  Some old lady in a regular fucking, like, whiskey barrel.  And she lived.  Unbelievable.  Really fucked up.  The rocks are what gets you, right?  Oh, man.  How far the fall is that?  And the water, because the water keeps pummeling you, and you drown.  Another guy died... 
[01:12:00]  You can't fight the water.  Another guy died.  He got into a barrel, big metal barrel, with a bunch of bolts on top, and they bolted  the hatch and stuff like that, and then he went over the falls and got stuck in one  of those currents from the falls where it's just spun, and stayed behind the waterfall,  spinning the barrel, and he suffocated after four hours of spinning in the barrel under  the falls.  Why couldn't anyone get him out?  He was underneath Niagara Falls, and it was, like, a while a long time ago. 
[01:12:30]  What a way to go.  You're car sick, basically, for four hours, and then die.  Oh, he's woozy.  And he took his turtle with him, and the turtle lived.  He opened it up, and his turtle was fine.  His turtle just kept walking into things for the rest of his life?  Just a very dizzy turtle.  It spun for four hours?  He probably knocked out before then, yeah.  Probably, and he just suffocated in there.  What a terrible death.  Another, there was two kids, a teenage daughter and a fucking son that was, like, maybe eight  or nine years old, whatever it was, and they were on a boat with some other guy, and the 
[01:13:00]  engine died on the boat, and they were on the river, and then the whole boat starts going  toward Niagara Falls, and they capsized, they grabbed onto some rocks, and the girl got  out.  Somebody reached over and grabbed her out, and then the boy actually, wearing nothing  but a life jacket, right over the falls, he pops out underneath, at the bottom, and  they pull him out, and he's fine.  Wow.  What a story.  Right over the fucking falls, wearing nothing. 
[01:13:30]  He said he remembers it, and said there was no sensation of falling whatsoever.  You're just in, he said like, he felt like you were in a cloud, just kind of there, and  then he was in the water.  Because you're probably, you're in the middle of such a rush of water.  Yeah, and it's all relative, you know, the water's falling at the same, um, the same speed  as you, so you're not feeling that wind resistance that you would feel if you were skydiving or  something like that.  You're falling at the same rate as the water, so relative to the water, you're really not  Right.  Gotcha.  Falling. 
[01:14:00]  It's kind of a weird thing.  What is that picture right there?  That's the guy on the jet ski that died.  It's been this morning.  Why did he do that?  95.  What year was that?  Yeah, I think that's about right.  How did he die?  Like, did he give a, he had a parachute?  He had a parachute.  Some people said the parachute deployed, but wasn't connected to his backpack.  Oh, God.  And he smashed onto the rock floor.  Look at the confidence in that shot.  He's like, okay.  Oh, he threw his arms out like, what?  Threw his arms out, and now all I have to do is hit this button, and I'm golden.  And it was supposed to propel him forward.  Right.  With a little rocket pack, so he wasn't in the falls, and he was away from the rocks. 
[01:14:30]  And then none of that happened.  He just plummeted to his death on the rocks below.  On a jet ski.  Yeah.  And then, oh, this was that brother and sister, where the brother went over and the sister  was rescued.  The sister was rescued by a black gentleman that he was over the rail, got his legs on  the rail, and grabbed her in.  And he went to visit her at the hospital, and they wouldn't let him in because he was black. 
[01:15:00]  What was this?  He saved her life.  Last week.  Oh.  No, no.  It was way back in the 50s, I believe.  Or maybe 60.  Terrible.  Early 60s.  Yeah, and they wouldn't let him in to visit the girl because he was black, but he saved  her life.  No, you're right, but there's no reason for resentment.  It doesn't happen now.  Behave.  I posted a couple of videos yesterday of shenanigans and hijinks.  Please.  Sarah from Buffalo.  Thank you, Sarah. 
[01:15:30]  ABC is airing it, but the ABC lawyers are the ones asking for the harness.  They said no harness, no broadcast.  Rolls right off the tongue.  You know what, though?  Yeah.  Fuck the money.  If I was that guy, I would untether and do it.  Everyone's there with video cameras.  Yeah.  It would be a massive video.  Yeah.  They would nice fuck you to everybody.  They'd cut away instantly.  Who cares, though?  He's taking the harness.  All right, we're going to go to a break right now.  You know what?  We'll be right back.  Then ABC is stupid because then that clip will be played on every news channel. 
[01:16:00]  Everywhere.  Every news channel will play it because he did do just that.  Okay, well, maybe here's the thing, then.  Maybe he's listening to us.  Maybe he's a fan.  Maybe he will do that.  Untether.  Maybe ABC is covering their bases, and he'll just unsnap it while he's walking.  That's up to him.  But we have a tether for you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We are covered.  Because these guys...  Now you do what you want.  These guys, in the end, unless you're the old guy that fell, they could do this in their sleep.  They're trained for this. 
[01:16:30]  And if they fall, look, it's terrible.  That's the thrill of watching it.  Right.  There's no thrill.  No one wants to see a guy with a tether on a tightrope because if you fall, there's no penalty.  There's nothing to that.  Nothing.  We all watched Evil...  I go back to Evil Knievel.  Sure.  Broke every bone, dude.  Every jump, we're convinced we're seeing his death.  We were seeing his death.  That's why we watched.  Go up to the top of the ramp, look around, roll back.  Oh, my God.  Do that pass like 20 fucking times.  I remember as a little kid, the anxiety. 
[01:17:00]  I'm just a little kid with anxiety because of Evil Knievel.  Oh, I know.  Remember when they would go, I think this is it.  And then...  All right.  He's coming up.  No, he's back up the top of the ramp.  There he is.  Look at this.  But remember, they would go, I think this is it right here.  And then, nope, he stopped at the top again.  Oh, this is the Caesars jump.  Yeah.  God, I wish there was a better video of this.  This fucking great.  I know some guys that have done some amazing things since, but Evil Knievel will always be  the best.  Look at the slow motion.  Whoa.  And then he just ragdolls. 
[01:17:30]  You know what he was thinking right there?  Wow, this is bad.  How bad did he get hurt there?  Oh, his back broke right there.  You see how close he was to paralyzing himself?  His arms, legs, yeah.  He flipped just enough where he didn't snap his neck.  Yep.  Wow.  And then he's just following the bike.  Look how many times he rolls.  Oh, man.  He should have broke his neck there on that roll.  This is amazing.  He just fucked that one up.  And that was on live TV, wasn't it?  That's the way it was back then.  We all handled it.  Yeah.  Everyone's like, holy shit, that was fucked up. 
[01:18:00]  Everyone's screaming.  They're like, what the fuck?  That's why you watch this stuff, though.  Yep.  The best.  Mm-hmm.  The best.  What was the one where he dramatically retired?  Like, I'll never do this again.  Was that the Snake River Canyon?  I don't know.  Maybe you can find it.  He was all banged up.  But they got a quick little interview.  They got him up and he's like, I'm done.  I'm done with this shit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was the man.  Oh, he was. 
[01:18:30]  Look at his rocket ship.  The Snake River.  Is that?  She comes out right away.  This was a dud.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it was.  You're relieved prematurely.  He started to roll.  I think he chickened out.  You think?  I think evil finally chickened out and pulled the chute.  The heights got out of the gate?  Yeah.  I think he realized, holy shit, I think I'm going into outer space.  Do you think he panicked with the rocket propulsion? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  It's like, holy shit.  Because you've got to think.  Can you rewind that again and go right to the launch?  And watch.  This thing's going straight up in the air.  It's supposed to go across a canyon.  It's going into outer space if he doesn't stop the fucking thing.  So you think maybe in his mind he said, all right, I've got to push this within a second.  Oh, hold on.  The wire thing.  Oh, here we go.  I keep.  It came down to these final moments of rehearsal.  The last chance to practice walking that narrow, steel wire. 
[01:19:30]  In fewer than 13 hours, the ground won't leave.  All right.  They're being overdramatic.  Oh, yeah.  This is their overdramatic.  He will walk tethered.  Right.  Facing no danger.  Just like you and I do.  It's the same as walking down the sidewalk.  He's in a generation.  I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's like, what the fuck?  I don't think that's Christmas morning.  Dude, on tether.  It'll be the biggest video ever.  1,500 feet across with a tether and underneath the falls that pose no danger to him. 
[01:20:00]  And you know the lawyer's like, no, it'll still be good, you know?  It'll still be good.  Defies gravity?  Yeah, with a line.  Right.  He's not defying anything.  And good for him for speaking out, going, look, they're forcing me to do this.  Yeah.  I always wondered how they get the cable across.  Look, they use a helicopter.  Yeah, but I never do that.  Is that how they do it?  How'd they do it in the old days, before helicopters?  Dude, Philippe Petit, when he...  That documentary is so amazing, because he explains how he got the rope across the towers. 
[01:20:30]  It started with an arrow.  Oh, right.  Like a piece of fucking string?  Right.  He went with a little string with an arrow, whatever, and then they went bigger and bigger.  And then pulled it across.  And then pulled it across.  And had to make sure it was all tight.  How do you figure that out?  I know.  Oh, nice.  What are we missing here?  Footsteps, creating waves that will then move back and forth along the wire.  And when those waves collide, a surprise bump in the road could spell doom for the daredevil. 
[01:21:00]  There's no doom!  It's all just an act of physical dexterity.  Oh, my God.  It's all just fucking nothingness now.  Linda, who's preparing for tonight.  This is like doing the whole shopping spree at a Costco.  Yes!  After hours.  Right.  The largest media spectacle.  The lights of which the world's never seen.  Oh, shut up!  This is a all-hands-on-deck production.  We pulled out all the stops to make sure that viewers...  No, you didn't pull out all the stops.  Yeah, like the fun stop you pulled out and ruined it.  Right.  That's not all stops, sir. 
[01:21:30]  Every moment and angle.  And 325,000 watts of lighting to illuminate the falls and the rope.  You're going to see the falls from beneath, from above, from the side.  Thousands will make the trip to the falls.  Wow, to watch a man tethered on a rope to boost tourism numbers...  ABC should be embarrassed.  ...visited by millions of Americans each year.  And for those tens of thousands here tonight, and the millions more...  Oh, it's that night?  Yeah.  It's not even happening today?  No.  I just said it's in... 
[01:22:00]  I've been saying it's in 12 hours.  12 hours tonight.  I don't listen to you, Sam.  You should.  I thought it was 8 o'clock this morning.  It's 8 o'clock tonight?  Yeah, that's what I kept saying.  So what are we doing?  You should listen to me.  We're wasting time.  Because you don't listen.  Well, I saw the countdown.  That looked like 12 minutes for...  No, it's three things.  Sam was talking like people listened to him.  Yeah, really.  Could have saved you some time.  The whole time Sam's trying to tell us it's 8 o'clock tonight.  Yeah, I don't know why you're previewing this.  It's not...  Why wouldn't they do it in the morning when everyone's up?  Everybody's going to be up.  It's 8 o'clock at night.  They've got to do it at night so you don't see the water.  No, they're going to be out, though, is what I mean. 
[01:22:30]  What?  They've got to do it at night so you don't see the safety line.  Oh.  It'll probably be a black safety line, like all...  Fucking...  It'll be behind his leg or something.  Or under his pants.  It'll go down and you don't know what it'll do?  It'll fucking come right out behind his ankle and it'll be like a circle that follows him,  like a thing, like a cock ring almost.  Yeah.  And it'll probably go around his waist under his pants.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it's going to be.  You won't see it.  A cock ring.  People are pointing out that this guy goes watching the Evil Knievel video jumping over  the canyon. 
[01:23:00]  Is it me or does it look like he was meant to shoot straight up?  Yeah.  Can we see that again?  Yeah.  The angle's fucked up.  Let's look at it again.  The angle is so fucked up.  Yeah, that's why.  He's going straight up in the air.  So he had no intention.  Maybe he said to himself, this will be cool either way.  Yeah.  Go back, Samuel.  He's about to launch.  Oh, he is?  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're...  Yeah, look at the angle.  That's like...  Wow.  It's not...  Yeah, get out of here. 
[01:23:30]  There's no way that would make it all the way to the other side.  Wow.  Oh, you know what?  It got squirrely on him.  It got a little squirrely.  You're really prematurely.  He went like...  He just cut the engine and pulled the fucking chute.  You know, why hasn't anyone done that?  It seems like something they can figure out, especially now.  I bet they could, but it's like, why?  This was a different time.  I don't know.  Make it like, look, I want to do this for evil or whatever.  People loved this shit back then. 
[01:24:00]  Now it's just like, eh.  You don't think it would be that big of a deal?  No.  To watch, I mean?  No, not anymore.  When I could turn on a fucking helmet cam video of an actual battle in Afghanistan.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Which was amazingly great.  Boy, I got to tell you, those fucking...  I was watching some of those last night, the helmet cams from Afghanistan.  Those people that made the Call of Duty games, boy, did they nail it.  It looks like fucking Call of Duty.  It just got bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, shooting their guns.  And you're watching going, wow, this looks cool. 
[01:24:30]  Not realizing, hey, that's a real guy.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  That's awesome.  And then, of course, in the comments, like, everybody knows so much better than the soldiers in the video.  That guy's just fucking throwing lead.  He's not even aiming.  Oh, really?  You know, why is the guy holding the rifle over his head and shooting over the rim of the fucking, uh, the little ravine?  Oh, maybe because he doesn't want to get his head blown off, Mr. Brave, when you're fucking, uh, playing Call of Duty?  Yeah, look at this shit. 
[01:25:00]  Doesn't it look like Call of Duty?  That's real.  That's launching grenades.  You got assholes disliking these videos?  Dude, it's amazing.  All the people that know everything.  See, that's why it's probably all from the Middle East.  Yeah, yeah, well, I hated this one.  That's why it's a joke, man.  Boo.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  It's just a, what an idiot.  Who would dislike this or comment on it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we know.  Well, of course, we know.  People are just idiots.  Well, this guy's launching some fucking grenades. 
[01:25:30]  God, that's great.  Could we break?  Break.  Break.  Bad break.  So, uh, when we get back, they're going to be doing the tightrope thing, Sam.  8 o'clock, right?  What?  8 p.m.?  8 p.m.  12 hours.  Damn it.  Bieber's on the Today Show, though.  Oh.  Oh.  Singing, uh, oh, look, he's helping a sick kid or something.  Good.  Now, Avalana has a nickname.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  She is Mrs. Bieber.  Oh.  She's at his lap.  She's at her own little wedding at the hospital. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And, um, we, um.  Speak up.  Yes.  We had the red top, but it wasn't really the red top.  No, it wasn't really the red top.  It was like E-Rock on his lap.  Oh.  A little bit.  They were, um, they were, like, they were.  What is that kid saying?  It's like a Roland.  What she's trying to say is there was a paper cutout of me. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, fuck.  Bieber heard you.  And she did the whole wedding with the paper cutout.  It was a paper.  Oh.  It was a paper.  She wanted to consummate this message.  Paper Bieber.  And you guys have stayed in touch.  Yes.  Yes.  Basically, we talk on iChat all the time.  Nice.  FaceTime, right?  Didn't we FaceTime?  Um, yeah.  We FaceTime it.  Would it be funny if you were like, he took his wee-wee out.  I didn't think I had it, but then I found it, and then I figured it out, and then we FaceTimed.  Remember, what did you say to me about my mom? 
[01:27:00]  Your mom is going to be your mother-in-law.  Your mother-in-law.  She's a tall tale.  It was nice, Adelana, to have you here in New York for this concert because I know you are a huge fan.  And, you know, he's going to go outside in just a couple of minutes with all the other fans.  Are you ready for that?  Yeah, I'm excited.  I'm excited to see all these other fans and be back in New York, and it's going to be really special.  And we should just mention to people, and we'll talk more about this.  You're in the midst of an international tour, so you're a busy young man these days.  Do you even know where you are?  Sometimes I don't.  I mean, sometimes I wait. 
[01:27:30]  I want to watch him sing.  I'll hold the baby.  You'll go out and sing, JB.  I'll hold you, friend.  I don't think I would be.  I'll watch her.  With your Uncle Paul.  Why?  She's going to sit right there on your lap and act good.  She already knows to hold it and talk into it.  The place is packed.  Of course it is.  How's Def Leppard doing?  He's a sensation.  Sensation?  He's a sensation.  Oh, God.  He's a marvelous performer. 
[01:28:00]  Bounce the kid in your lap.  Yay.  Your pal, Jerry Sandusky, is in trouble, Uncle Paul.  It's not fair just trying to teach people how to tackle.  You wanted to go to the game, didn't you?  What do you think?  Tickets are free?  Hey, get over here and drink Uncle Paul's Snake Earl.  You want to go see the game, do you?  Get your underpants off. 
[01:28:30]  Put you on a 50-yard line.  Oh, that's pretty good seats.  Way up, though.  Oh.  Technically, you're on a 50-yard line.  That's bullshit.  Before the game.  We can walk over and stand on it.  While he's doing the voice and everything, he's touching himself.  Yeah.  Oh, God, he is.  He's squeezing it.  Well, he's got to get into character.  Mind your business.  I'll take you up to the game while Dottie makes stew upstairs.  Fucking Dottie should be on trial.  I had the basement soundproof so no one could hear. 
[01:29:00]  Come on over.  I'll tuck you in, kiss you on the forehead.  Getting so big so fast.  Yeah, you look so cute in your jersey.  I like when the plastic from the letters rubs on your nipples and they get hard when you put the new jersey on.  Let Uncle Paul give him a little kiss to make them all better.  You like your little boy titty sucked?  Okay.  Oh, man.  I think I just hit the wall. 
[01:29:30]  I think that might have been too much violent.  I like my titties sucked.  Oh, my God.  You like your titties sucked?  Jesus.  Give me a number four.  Let me suck your titties.  Number four?  Did he call them victim number four and victim number nine?  Come on.  I'm going to do a raspberry on your stomach.  I'm going to breathe.  Yay.  When I do the raspberry on your stomach, I can smell your excitement.  Oh, my God.  Your nervous, boyish excitement. 
[01:30:00]  Your turn.  Terrible.  Your turn.  Let me guide you.  No, no.  Let me show you where to go.  No.  You want to talk about Niagara Falls a little more?  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Niagara Falls.  Yay.  You're going to rub your belly.  Let me say hi to Todd.  Todd, that's a cute name.  Hey, Todd.  Hey, how's it going?  Good, man.  Hi, Todd.  We're trying to get out of the Uncle Paul thing. 
[01:30:30]  It ain't going to work.  It's getting a little too creepy today.  Yeah, Todd.  What are you calling for, Todd?  You got some tips for me?  Put the Nittany Lions hat on them, and then you stick it in while they're enjoying themselves.  Oh.  You put them on that belly, and you stick it in from the back.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Subtle at all.  Yeah, you put the Nittany Lion hat on.  What happened to being subtle?  I am being subtle.  Yeah.  I'm trying not to say fuck his hiney. 
[01:31:00]  Jesus.  I say stick it in, because they can't prove that in court.  Oh, my God.  Todd, what do you got on Niagara Falls before we go to break?  I was just going to say, you're making this big deal about tether or no tether.  Fuck, the original guy that did it took a fucking table and chairs out to the middle  and had lunch.  Are you making that up?  No.  Look it up.  I actually think he's telling the truth.  Look it up.  There are a couple of wacky things that happened, because a couple of people went over on tightrope, 
[01:31:30]  and they tried to outdo each other.  So one guy actually, for some reason, put an oldie washing machine on his back and did it.  Another guy did it with his manager on his shoulders.  What the fuck?  That was the same guy with the table.  Same guy with the table?  Can you imagine having to be the guy on the shoulders?  Fuck that.  Yeah.  I don't care how good you are.  You would shit your pants.  Hard way to make a living.  Yeah, but imagine fucking forgetting.  I would hate to have Jonathan on my back with his giant bulge on the back of my neck.  It'd be hanging over my shoulder like a stall. 
[01:32:00]  It'd be a nice counterweight.  That'd keep you nice and balanced, as long as you have one ball bag on each side.  There's a giant tether.  No.  Yeah, so it just shows you how ridiculous Lawyers and ABC is.  I mean, if you live in that world, you know how easy this really is, especially when you're in your prime.  I gather.  If you could put an old washing machine on your back.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right, we'll do some Sandusky stuff next. 
[01:32:30]  I'll talk about Sandusky.  J.S.  He didn't do nothing.  Okay, Uncle Paul.  I can understand if he didn't get the tickets, you get angry.  He always provided the entertainment.  Oh, so you're saying as long as he gave the kids the tickets, you know, quid pro quo, as they say.  Sure, I don't know.  I don't work at pro quo.  Uncle Paul's an idiot. 
[01:33:00]  I ain't quitting nothing.  Mind your business.  I told him, come on, we'll go to the game.  And then when they come over, you just put it on a TV and you give them raspberries.  A lot of kids were uncomfortable with your emotional attachment.  It wasn't even so much, well, it was the sexual thing, but you were very emotional rubbing the legs and sending love letters.  Sure, like we was on a date. 
[01:33:30]  I'd rub his little leg by his shorts.  I'd go, look at your little umbros.  Let me hike up your umbro shorts.  Your umbro shorts?  Write him a letter, roses are red, violets are blue.  Let me put that in my mouth, you.  You're like my sunshine.  You're like, you're like a can of warm sardine oil pouring down my throat.  You're like salve that I rub on my privates when they're all chafed from running around. 
[01:34:00]  I want to be your preparation H, always getting in there and making you feel better.  Right.  Holy shit.  My tongue is your toilet paper.  I love you.  I need a best friend.  Somebody to run down to the store and get me ciggies. 
[01:34:30]  Ciggies, huh?  Come back and sit on my lap.  Little Nittany Lions jersey.  Yay.  Yay.  Jesus.  All right, everyone.  Yeah, we'll, uh...  Play soap battle.  Oh, yes, of course.  Soap battle?  You got some in your pee hole.  I'll get it.  That used to sting.  Sure it did.  Until you get a nice tongue-down ass slathering it off.  Yeah, I don't suggest jacking it with Irish Spring. 
[01:35:00]  Back in the old days before, you know, when you just had to make do with what Mom bought  with the old, uh, the old house.  The shampoo will also burn your pee hole.  Shampoo is very bad, yeah.  That'll burn your pee hole, man.  Burns their backsides, too.  Ow!  I think his biggest crime was that he added love to the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  That love shit.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  He was, uh...  He was really into them. 
[01:35:30]  Wow.  They don't like when you're too lovey-dovey, especially when they're discovering girls.  Yeah.  Oh, when they're really young, you know, when someone's six, they appreciate good love.  But as they get older, they don't like it.  Quit kissing me!  Chew a piece of gum, Mr. Hargis!  You smell like sardines and ciggies!  But again, like with the sardine, uh, some of the, like, pieces of sardine get stuck under  your bridge work? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, my God!  Yeah!  One time, one time I sneezed, and I got a piece of sardine skin in his pubis.  Yay, Jerry!  Terrible.  Hope he gets acquitted.  Oh, or acquitted.  Oh, they're still teasing the Bieber thing.  Of course.  I think, I think GMA might have the Beach Boys today.  Oh, really?  Does Trey want to talk about Brian Wilson some more today? 
[01:36:30]  What does PalTalk think?  I like the Brian Wilson discussion myself.  Do you like his new hairdo, by the way?  Bieber's got the older guy haircut.  Yeah, now he's, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, he's got the Kwan.  You know, uh, the, uh, did you see those pictures of Justin Bieber, um, at the basketball  game?  With, uh, his chick there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Selena.  Yeah, Selena Gomez is like, she's like, oh, man, and her hand's like, something's happening.  She's really into the game.  She's into the game. 
[01:37:00]  And Justin's just kind of kicking back, texting.  Like, not into the game.  Yeah.  Checking his Twitter, probably.  They're implying that he's the woman in the relationship.  Like everybody else.  Yeah.  No, that's not it.  No, that's not it.  Wow, he looks really different with his hair like that.  That's why they, that's why they, whoever's in charge of him is pretty fucking smart.  Like, they're, uh, trying to, yeah, get him out of that whole thing.  And, uh, uh, unfortunately for him, uh, he's wearing a hair piece already.  That's terrible.  That's too bad.  Didn't he do something on that?  Lost all his hair already? 
[01:37:30]  Fuck.  There it is.  No, no, that's not the one.  Didn't he do something on fucking, uh, yes, he did.  On SNL with, uh.  Yes, he did.  What?  What?  It was a thing he did.  A thing?  Yeah, but it was good.  Oh, and then there's Def Leppard and, oh boy.  Are they playing?  Yeah.  If you're alone tonight.  All right, let's hear it.  All right, he's doing Hysteria.  Let's hear it.  Well, they don't sing in the morning.  Here we go. 
[01:38:00]  Look, there's no one there.  That is Joe Elliott, the original lead singer for Def Leppard.  That's all they're giving him?  That's all they're giving him?  That's all they're giving him?  It's on Hysteria.  Why?  By the way, he says that, uh.  Why are you talking over it?  Even though he lives in Ireland, he wakes up with Fox and Friends.  Oh, that's fantastic.  And also, he's fantastic to see it.  Not anymore, as you talk over his song.  I've never seen it before.  His song.  He's got one arm, and he's still drumming.  What?  And it's amazing.  When did that happen? 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  Holy shit.  He's drumming longer with one arm.  They figured it out, and then he is with two.  What?  Wow.  He should only get paid half price or something.  So you'll see it, hopefully short.  Single gun.  I'm just psyched because it's a rock and roll band, and it brings me back to the 80s, and  that's my generation.  I'm just psyched to get out there.  Holy shit, a fellow child of the 80s right there in front of us, Sam.  I just think it's insulting that they talk over their song and then announce that it brings  them back to the 80s.  Right.  They're the most irrelevant band.  Right, right.  And what he just said was just babble, and you could have had another 30, 40 seconds 
[01:39:00]  of Def Leppard.  He announced that the drummer had one arm.  I knew that the drummer had one arm.  They just set up a huge stage for these guys, and then they don't even fucking really play.  And there's nobody down there, so they're counting on the television audience.  Right.  Is there a lot of people there?  No.  No.  Can we look down and see them, or no?  Yeah, from our office you can, I think.  I'm going to go look.  I'll tell you.  All right.  Take a look, Jimmy.  Well, why would anybody...  Like, Justin Bieber is playing a block away.  Yeah.  That's where everybody is.  Exactly.  Def Leppard is not winning this one today, huh? 
[01:39:30]  At least the Beach Boys are all the way in Central Park.  What's that chick with a fucking Chris Brown's fucking punching bag?  Rihanna?  Yeah, Rihanna.  She's got a fucking forehead, like one of those beluga whales.  It's like she keeps sonar equipment in there.  She's so hot.  That's what they call a five-head.  She's got that...  Like, it protrudes, like crazy.  Are you sure?  Yeah, they just showed a massive forehead.  Wow.  It is.  She's like one of those hiney-headed aliens from fucking Star Trek.  When she did...  She's got that silky pussy, because they're fighting over it now. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah!  Holy shit.  Chris Brown couldn't handle what Drake did.  Yeah.  I know this one.  Drake?  Chris Brown sends over a bottle, like a $2,000 bottle to Drake.  Drake's like, fuck that.  Give the bottle back to Chris Brown.  And basically he said, I'm still fucking Rihanna.  Oh, man.  Or something like that.  And then glasses started flying.  Oh, yeah.  And then everyone...  I'm very surprised.  No gunfire.  No gunfire.  No gunfire.  But a lot of glass.  What's that happen?  It's like R&B, though.  It's not like rap.  Yeah.  What's this...  Isn't that the Chocolate Rain guy? 
[01:40:30]  Chocolate Rain guy.  Call Me Maybe.  Oh, he's doing Call Me Maybe.  What's Call Me Maybe?  Boy, he's trying for a follow-up hit.  It's the number one song in America.  Oh, we know.  Thanks to...  Who broke it.  Who broke it, Anthony?  Tell the people who broke it.  You and Troy Kwan.  After opening Anthony Live, broke it.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  Did you not hear me?  Iraq didn't think it was important to play today.  You want me to grab it?  We didn't play it yesterday, but...  I'll grab it.  Maybe we'll play it later.  I don't know.  I want to take a break.  Chocolate Rain. 
[01:41:00]  Let's break, please.  All right.  What'd you see, Jimmy?  Uh-oh.  Jimmy just looked out the window at the Def Leppard show going on for Fox News.  How'd it look?  Sparse.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I'll say...  You could walk up to the stage and see Def Leppard right now.  But they only play...  And Bieber, it's literally from one block to the other.  An entire city block.  Oh, no.  It's way more than that.  I mean, like, in that place where the stage is for the Today Show, it goes from one block 
[01:41:30]  right across the plaza, across by 30 Rock, where the Christmas tree usually is, to the  other block.  Well, Bieber's so hot that people are standing where there's a building in their way and  they don't care.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The, um...  I had Danny snap...  Because I'm such an asshole, I didn't bring my cat my phone.  Oh, silly goose.  Danny's going to snap a picture and text it to me, and I will Twitter it.  Oh, good.  You could be your own judge.  An aerial view.  Judge for yourself, as they say. 
[01:42:00]  I want to go aerial view.  Let's go take our picks.  All right, we'll break Sandusky and, uh...  We'll Sandusky.  Some other shit, I guess.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah.  Maybe this will play.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Ovi and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  All right, we're back.  Def Leppard is performing again.  What song is this? 
[01:42:30]  I think it was the one I heard this morning.  It sounds like Def Leppard, but I don't...  It never got to a hook that I know.  Oh, boy.  You're my destination?  Like...  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Ugh.  Hokey.  Noah.  No one's rocking to it.  No one is. 
[01:43:00]  Standing there.  We all took pictures from above.  You know what she sees in your future?  What happened there?  Did they just go to commercial?  They just come to commercial.  They are fucking these guys so terribly.  We would have taken care of them.  Oh, God.  That's great.  And I know we have an audience that definitely at least competes with Fox and Friends.  Oh, did they just get...  We would have taken care of Def Leppard.  We would have had them play a couple songs.  One we know.  One we don't know.  They cut them right off, like in mid-fucking stream for a KFC commercial. 
[01:43:30]  That was great.  Tummies.  Kind of makes me happy.  I guess you guys know what you're doing, huh?  Yeah.  You'll deal with their bullshit over there.  Oh, my God.  So, Sandusky, huh?  Oh, you want to do Sandusky?  Yeah, we ought to talk a little Sandusky.  I guess victim number nine.  This is the last victim, too.  That's coming forward.  I think it was the eighth.  Number nine was yesterday. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, but I think they said...  Collect them all.  Hey, I'll trade you a number two for a six.  Number seven's hard to get.  He's a crier.  I know he's victim number nine, but I thought I read that only eight hit the stand.  So, is there another guy that maybe they didn't...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I guess it's not that important.  Well, they called him victim number nine in the courtroom.  And this one really coming up with some scathing accusations.  Well, you got to close strong. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  They open big.  They open big with the shower guy.  You open with what?  With one of the shower kids.  What band do you like?  I was going to go Zeppelin.  I know you don't like Zeppelin that much.  Well, you got to open big.  So, what's your band?  Blue Oyster Cult.  Well, no.  No?  Not really.  Open with Burning For You and then Don't Fear The Reaper?  Does that work for you?  I don't like Reaper.  You don't like Reaper?  Too commercial, man.  Godzilla?  Oh, Adam Sandler's on NBC. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, there you go.  Jesus Christ.  I couldn't come over here, I guess.  Oh, my God.  This might be prerecorded.  What?  Oh, wait.  No, I'm looking out the window.  You're not related?  We have the same close names, same initials.  I got a movie out.  I want to do some crazy stuff in the movie.  Wait, is it prerecorded or no?  I don't know.  It doesn't look like it.  There's a fuckload of people out there for Bieber.  I let Andy go back to the show.  He was walking through the Bieber crowd signing things, according to E-Roc.  Oh. 
[01:45:30]  So, yeah.  Fuck it, Sandler.  Wake the fuck up.  We all know the same people.  You need help with the fucking movie.  Enough already with this shit.  I like to do this shit.  Well, I was looking at Justin Bieber outside.  I got a lot of people out there.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  He quotes lines to me.  I tell you.  There's a lot of people out there.  You're getting 13% positive reviews.  You should go on every fucking show possible.  Amazing.  And we would treat him nice because we haven't seen the movie.  That's true.  That's true.  It's a funny party. 
[01:46:00]  You'll have a good time if you see it.  You should not bring your little kids.  No doubt about that.  It's rated R for crude sexual content throughout nudity, pervasive language.  You think he's still uncomfortable or he just plays that?  No, he's uncomfortable.  You think he's just uncomfortable to be in public like this?  Straight filth and enjoyed embracing the dirtiness.  You play a kid named Donnie Berger, a grown-up kid, who had a relationship.  I had a relationship with my teacher. 
[01:46:30]  It was really inappropriate.  She went to jail.  It was inappropriate.  You know, he was in school and the teacher, the teacher, come on to me and I have a baby.  And he basically is so traumatized and you show up as his father only when you need money.  Well, maybe I wanted to see my boy get married, too.  He turned his back on me.  Remember that.  That's right.  And there, and that's where the movie really gets really good.  And at the end, we both learn a little lesson about life and how we both need each other. 
[01:47:00]  I just don't get it anymore.  I don't either.  The guy needs help with a movie.  Sorry, I don't get it.  Fuck, I don't get it.  Enough of these people.  What do you got there, Travis?  I was going to say, going back to Sandusky, there was two victims testified yesterday.  Oh, a double shot.  There was the one, there was the big closer.  Yeah.  And then earlier, it was Tickle Monster. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, Tickle Monster.  Oh, Tickle Monster.  So we had Tickle Monster and Forcible Rape yesterday.  Forcible Rape.  Sometimes you got to switch gears.  I mix it up a little bit.  If the Tickle Monster ain't getting you where you got to be, you got to pull out all stops.  Blackjack to the back of the head.  Oh, shit.  Get your face in that pillow.  God damn it, I can't give those tickets away twice.  Oh, yeah.  All of a sudden, now your hiney hurts. 
[01:48:00]  Didn't hurt when you was eating popcorn watching the game, did it?  Holy shit.  Oh, now all of a sudden, you're crying.  You're dabbing your backside with little wet naps.  You weren't doing that when I was getting your pretzel.  Oh, we're getting a very aggressive Uncle Paul this morning.  Oh, yeah.  Uncle Paul doesn't even care anymore.  All right.  Well, Adam Saylor's...  I just want to make sure people come out and see the movie because it's really good.  And it's about me.  And I'm a crazy guy in the movie.  A crazy guy. 
[01:48:30]  We get it.  We were supposed to get him, weren't we?  Yeah, of course.  Well, not for this movie, but if we took some other people, we would get him.  But then he did his serious thing, so he didn't want to do this show or whatever.  And that's not a slam on Roland, because now Roland's going to be...  This one's like, it's like, happy Gilmore meets Spanglish.  Right?  Enough of him.  Enough of him.  He's so fucking rich. 
[01:49:00]  Adam Saylor's rich.  How did you do that?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Jimmy just leaned over.  Sam takes his little notes and writes down stuff on his little pad over there.  And Jimmy just leans over and scribbles all over what he's been writing.  I love when he leaves in the room I'll draw cock and balls on him.  All right, you want to go through this with the big thumb?  Yeah, yeah.  I want to go slowly through this.  Final prosecution witness testifies. 
[01:49:30]  So you've got two articles there.  Apparently he wasn't just into...  You have two articles.  One is forcible rape.  Oh, boy.  The second one is tickle monster.  Well, I mean, there's a lot of details.  Which do you want to start with?  The hot one or the funny one?  Who's the closer?  The one that says that...  Forcible rape is the closer.  Forcible rape.  That's the closer.  You always close with forcible rape.  Tickle monster is always a cute story up front.  Yeah, and then the forcible rape is your close sexy.  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you, that's how you close a rom-com with a forcible rape. 
[01:50:00]  You open it with tickle monster.  Yeah, you open up all fun and it's all fun and games.  And then you've got to get serious to end the rom-com.  Yeah.  I don't feel like reading this.  You want me to?  If you don't mind.  I'll be happy to.  I'm actually shaking.  I've got to eat.  More accusers detail Sandusky's alleged abuse.  Oh, no.  He's going to re-elect it.  Two more accusers. 
[01:50:30]  I can't hear it.  It's too good for any character.  Two more accusers took the stand at Jerry Sandusky's sex abuse trial Thursday.  One of whom said the former Penn State assistant football coach called himself the tickle monster.  Look out.  Before embracing him in the shower.  And another who said he was distraught that the two lost touch.  Like, so he goes, I'm the tickle monster. 
[01:51:00]  He basically pulled a Josh Goodnationly in the shower.  Look at that tickle monster coming through.  The second snitch, now 25, said he loved Sandusky and that he viewed him as a father figure,  but that he became angry with Sandusky because he never reached out to him after the witness was sent out of the area to live in a group home.  So, basically, it was a fuck him and forget him relationship.  He just forgot about me like I was nothing, said the man in court documents as victim number three. 
[01:51:30]  I would pray he would call me and maybe find a way to get me out there, but it never happened.  So, that was a twisted way he knew love was from this old guy.  From Sandusky.  Yes, Sandusky.  The two alleged victims who testified Thursday brought to seven the number of accusers to take the stand over the trial's first four days.  Jurors also heard about two other alleged victims who have not been located by investigators. 
[01:52:00]  Hopefully, they don't have their head buried in the sand because, well, that's the perfect position.  Get it?  Because he's a rapist.  One of the men, now a member of the Army National Guard, describes frequent sleepovers at Sandusky's home in 1998 and 1999 that included the ex-coach rubbing his body, touching his penis.  He said Sandusky also gave him a bear hug in the shower.  Fucking yuck!  Ah, big naked bear hug. 
[01:52:30]  Come here, he's all wet.  Ah!  Harry.  What's the worst part of that?  The big, he's calling himself the tickle monster.  Yeah.  Yay, and then hugging you.  Between rubbing his body and touching his penis and the bear hug, which one is the worst?  Rubbing the body is bad because it's too intimate.  I mean, a lot of people would think touching the penis, but I think when it starts getting...  The bear hug, I think, is the worst.  That intimate shit.  Because you do...  A dick grab is just a dick grab that's awful.  A hug is something you do to your father or your friends. 
[01:53:00]  Like, there's other associations with hugs that are not sexual.  There's no other association with your cock.  I would go bear hug is the worst.  A naked bear hug is worse, believe it or not, than him touching your penis.  The man said he looked at his mother at the time.  No, I agree with you.  You know?  Yeah, absolutely.  The dick part, at least you get to come, you get to tell him, go slow, go slow.  The guy did not get along with his mother, of course, so this predator picked up on that.  He didn't know where his father was.  He testified that he felt uncomfortable when Sandusky touched his genitals in bed, 
[01:53:30]  and that he would roll over to prevent anything else from happening.  Oh, Jesus.  Roll over.  But that didn't...  Well, that backfired.  It sure does.  Literally.  Because then you wind up rolling back over and let Richard suck.  Suck it.  But that he didn't tell Sandusky not to get into bed with him.  So he rolled over to make pretend.  But then again, Sandusky might have misinterpreted that as offering up his ass cheeks. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, he probably did, yeah.  He might have picked up more trouble than he bargained for.  I don't have to flip him over myself.  He made me feel like I was a part of something, like a family.  The man said, you are a little, a human Lego set.  He gave me things that I hadn't had before.  Oh, chlamydia.  Bleeding ass.  Horrible memories.  Fucking, you know, stomach sleep for two weeks.  He said that he loved Sandusky.  Wow, that's the same guy?  And that Sandusky treated him like he was part of an extended family who was unconditionally loved. 
[01:54:30]  That's just depressing.  Earlier Thursday, the other accuser testified that Sandusky called himself the tickle monster  and embraced the then 11-year-old boy in a Penn State shower in 98.  The encounter prompted an investigation, but ultimately ended without any charges being filed.  Earlier Thursday, the man, another accuser, testified that Sandusky called himself,  oh, I just read that, I'm sorry.  Yeah, the 25-year-old victim, known in courts as Victim 6, told jurors Sandusky embraced him in the locker room shower, 
[01:55:00]  lathering up his back and shoulders, then lifting him chest to chest in the shower to rinse out his hair.  Wait, he lifted him up?  Like, I'll rinse your hair.  I do that with my two-year-old.  Oh.  Well, you've got to lift him up toward the shower head.  Yeah, that's chest to chest, though.  Oh, Bieber's on.  Oh, here's his voice.  Let's hear a little Bieber first.  That's fucking creepy.  I'd love to.  That is creepy.  Here's the Biebs. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  Let's see if he sounds better this time.  He looks good.  I can take a kiss, you ain't never been before.  Baby, take a chance, so you'll never, ever know.  What's this sounding black thing?  Stop it.  Sweat, sweat on you.  Chilling by the fire while we eating fondue.  I don't know about you, but I don't know about you.  So it's a helix of falsetto in three, two, sweat.  I'd like to be everything you want.  Hey, girl.  Eating fun, dude. 
[01:56:00]  If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go.  I'd keep you on my own, girl.  You'd never be alone.  And I could be a gentleman, anything you want.  If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Oh, no, I'm the fault.  They were just showing the audience.  And that's Good Morning America.  That's the Beach Boys. 
[01:56:30]  And then Fox News has the fucking Jeff Whopper.  Take your dance to a spin and a twirling.  Who is going crazy?  I'll listen up like a whirlwind.  This is just the Beach Boys.  It could all be California girls.  Absolutely amazing.  The Beach Boys.  Shut up.  How awful is that?  Fucking horrible.  Sam Champion.  Is that Sam Champion?  And trust me, he probably wants to be there at California. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, Opie, we're missing this song.  Opie.  Opie.  If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go.  Look at the dances behind him.  Yeah, he's got a pretty big crowd there, huh?  Oh, look, he's walking in.  The girls are freaking out.  But where's the talent?  It's so overproduced.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  He's kind of like everything.  Do you like his outfit?  The fingerless gloves? 
[01:57:30]  Oh, now he's doing a little dance number.  He's terrible.  This is great.  This is so douchey.  This is not a good dance number.  No, it's so douchey.  He should fire his dance coordinator.  Oh, what's he doing?  They're dancing like Raj from What's Happening.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  He's trying to grab his ass.  What's going on?  Oh, who are these people?  He's got a lot of dancers out there with him.  He could just pick anybody out of that crowd and just fucking suck my dick.  Of course, there'd be a crime. 
[01:58:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Yay!  Yay!  Justin Bieber, thank you very much.  We're back with much more.  Yay!  He's actually good at, like...  He was marvelous.  He's drumming.  Like, he's actually an okay musician.  Yeah.  But none of that's on display there.  He's not a good singer.  He's not a good dancer at all.  That's so overproduced.  Well, he's not...  He's supposed to be, like, talented, man.  Too much singer...  Too much over...  Yeah, he's not a strong singer.  Like, wasn't Leif Garrett... 
[01:59:00]  Oh, fucking no.  Go over the last X amount of years, sex symbols, like teen idols.  I understand you sacrifice something when it's a teen idol.  They don't care as much about the singing.  No.  Justin Timberlake could actually sing.  He was great, man.  And so it's fucking...  Wasn't, like, Leif Garrett a good singer back in the day?  Or was he not good?  I don't think so.  I think he wasn't good either.  Oh, was he not good?  Okay.  Yeah, I don't think he was good either.  He just fit the suit.  Fit that suit.  That's why that Brady Bunch episode was brilliant.  Because that's what they do.  Yeah, yeah.  They pick a guy that's kind of talented, and then they fucking make him the thing.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Make him the next big thing.  Yeah.  The man said...  Oh, yeah.  Let's go.  Back to Sandusky.  Yeah, the shared shower happened after a brief workout at the campus gym, even though he  hadn't broken a sweat.  Oh, boy.  Do you need a shower?  No, I'm right.  No, you need one.  Trust me.  His mother went to authorities when she saw her son come home with wet hair.  Ah!  Dead giveaway right there.  Although the inquiries spawned by the report didn't lead to any charges.  That whole fucking culture out there. 
[02:00:00]  It's amazing.  The witness, who described himself as a big football fan, testified that Sandusky had  given him a tour of the Penn State football locker room and training facilities and had  him try on some equipment of players.  Oh, God.  Including star running back Curtis Ennis.  With jock straps.  Across examination, the man testified that in recent years, he and Sandusky exchanged text  messages, sent notes for holidays and special occasions, and last summer met for lunch.  He also told the court that Sandusky and his wife, Doody, had supported a mission trip 
[02:00:30]  he took to Mexico.  Doody.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  He is despicable.  Wow.  I just wish they would take more people down in this whole case.  Like Dottie.  Yeah, Dottie is just a fucking...  Dottie, what the fuck?  Turn your head, old turn your head, Dottie.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Put on the old blinders there.  She comes up in these transcripts a lot. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  There was one in a hotel room where, what, she was in the other room, but adjoining rooms,  basically.  Yeah, yeah.  And she just ignored.  She was constantly, like, walking in when he was with boys and...  What a horrible fucking person.  Oh, yeah.  Just...  Call Believe coming out next week.  Justin, you know, when you look at all of these people, when you hear more than 8,000  people, we think one of the biggest concerts ever for us.  What do you want to say to all of these people who've camped out and love you so much this 
[02:01:30]  morning?  I mean, all I can really say is that, you know, it's just amazing for me to be able  to see all you beautiful faces as it is for you to see me.  Why is he talking like a black person?  Stop that!  It's cold, and I always appreciate everything I do for me.  I really love you, Justin.  All we've brought, Justin, we've been telling people that you should be creating these great  signs to bring with them for the concert today.  And you can kind of look out and see that a lot of people really took us seriously.  There's some great ones. 
[02:02:00]  I know that you and Scooter and some other people...  You know what the signs do?  Blocks your fucking view.  People get pissed.  Right.  You want more of this or no?  Yes.  There's one right here.  It's like, it's got like Buzz Lightyear and me, and it's like rotating.  Maybe that one right there.  Oh, I see it right in the middle.  It's rotating.  That one's pretty cool.  Is that the one you want to choose?  Because the winner of the sign contest is going to get what?  Two free tickets to my concert.  That sign sucks.  Yay!  So is that the official announcement?  That's the official announcement. 
[02:02:30]  We got the winner.  It's over here with the globe.  All right, we're going to get that person signed and get that person.  We'll meet them in just a couple of minutes.  How did they pull this off with a contest, but we can't do it without all contesting rules  and show up?  You've got to have an email.  You've got to have an email.  It's a confirmation.  Oh, you're right.  Because we're aging shitheads.  Are you kidding me?  It's NBC again.  They just do it right, man. 
[02:03:00]  That's right.  They do.  They're a good company.  He's premiering his new album.  He has another new album.  Is he really?  Yeah.  When?  This weekend.  What's the new album?  Is that where the boyfriend song is on?  Yeah.  I hope so.  And they're playing all the tracks.  So he wants a boyfriend?  No.  Doesn't he want a boyfriend and no one's talking about that?  That's what the song is, right?  I think he's describing what it would be like if he was someone's boyfriend.  What?  He wants a boyfriend.  I don't think so.  That's what I think.  Yeah, that's what I think, too.  He wants a boyfriend.  Okay.  Well, that's not what the lyrics say.  We live in a different world, so it's okay. 
[02:03:30]  So he wants a boyfriend and that's cool?  Not according to the lyrics, no.  Their title song in just a moment.  But first, let's give a proper welcome.  A proper welcome to Mike.  Come on.  Mike Wells.  Brian Wilson.  Yeah.  Brian Wilson.  He's not standing by now.  And he wasn't on stage with them.  He wasn't on stage?  I didn't see him, no.  You all have been so good to us, Brian.  It is wonderful to see you back. 
[02:04:00]  So what is it like for all of you to be touring again for the first time together?  Oh, Mike, it's been 20 years.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  It's fantastic, actually.  It couldn't be better.  The audiences are loving it.  And I think it reinforces that concept.  Yes, he does.  He's not.  And they're holding it.  That's well put.  That's well put.  He's got his hand on his shoulder.  Brian, I just love looking into those beautiful eyes of yours.  And we have, you are loved and beloved.  You have a question. 
[02:04:30]  It is the Pepsi fan favorite question.  We asked our audience what's the number one question they want.  And this is it.  How is touring different 50 years later?  Well, you've got a lot of practice.  It's getting better each year.  What is that guy in the back just laughing?  I don't know.  Much too.  We graduated from the station wagon and the U-Haul trailer.  I'll tell you that.  He's laughing loudly and saying, pay no attention to Brian.  To have you all back. 
[02:05:00]  And this new music.  I mean, how did this one come about?  This is a creation from our resident genius here, Brian Wilson.  Oh, my God.  He turned it off.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  It's like quartz.  It looks like they put old man makeup on him.  Okay, guys, we believe in you again.  It's the guy that lost his hair years ago but doesn't want to admit it.  We've never stopped believing in you guys.  Oh, wow.  Never.  Never.  Do you want to hear new music from the Beach Boys? 
[02:05:30]  Why wouldn't you?  That's why God made the radio here again.  The Beach Boys.  Thank you, gentlemen.  We're back and better than ever.  We're back.  What song?  It's a new song.  But Brian Wilson isn't playing with that.  Yes, he is.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, he's not playing.  Where is he?  He's still at the keyboard.  Off to the side somewhere. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, there he is.  He is playing.  Where is he?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, this is terrible.  Uh-oh.  There's my God. 
[02:06:30]  What's Bieber singing now?  Baby, baby, baby.  Yay!  There's my God.  There's my God.  Everybody jump, ready?  Baby, jump, baby.  Jump, jump, jump.  Oh, stop with the jumping.  He used to do this song before puberty when he could still sing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The baby, baby was a lot higher. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, these people.  Oh, yuck.  A lot of good singing on TV this morning.  Yeah.  Oh, the big finale. 
[02:07:30]  Jesus Christ.  And we have yet more music from Justin Bieber in just a moment.  But first, this is today on NBC.  You know who's getting forgotten today?  Def Leppard.  They haven't gone back to that since they cut him off in mid-  For a chicken commercial.  For a chicken commercial.  Oh, man.  Poor Def Leppard.  That's a rough business.  Yeah.  Well, fuck them.  We would have treated them right.  Yes, we would have. 
[02:08:00]  They show Bieber in his entirety.  He had fucking a half hour of interview beforehand.  Right.  And Def Leppard does one verse.  The guy steps all over their song with talking.  And then they cut to a chicken commercial with no fanfare.  They're using them as bumper music for their broadcast.  Yes.  Fuck you guys.  That's the thing on the live bumper music.  You know what?  Fuck you guys.  You stupid idiots.  Man.  Fucking wake up.  We would have treated you nice.  New song.  Old song.  Interview.  You would have done an hour with us. 
[02:08:30]  They haven't gone back to that.  We treat Drew Boogie better than they're treating Gas Leppard.  Right.  Look at the old bags at the fucking Beach Boys concert.  Oh, no.  Ew.  What was that?  I don't know.  Horrible fat.  I was the beach ball.  Yeah.  Tranny got to meet Brian Wilson when he was up here, when Ron interviewed him.  When did he interview him?  What?  Ron interviewed Brian Wilson?  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it was, uh...  You gotta tell me about some of this stuff. 
[02:09:00]  It was probably two years ago at this point.  Oh, my God.  I would have loved to met Brian Wilson.  Did we try to get him or not?  Did we try to get him or not?  Brian Wilson.  He wouldn't.  He was doing that and that was it.  I mean, he came in in the afternoon.  Oh.  He was not doing it.  How was he on the interview?  Good.  Off and on.  What's his problem?  Does anyone know?  He fried his brain.  Yeah, he's a mental patient.  I mean, he did a lot of acid.  Like, a lot.  Oh, is that what he did?  Acid?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, here we go.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You see that video? 
[02:09:30]  Oh, the guy doing acid?  Oh, no.  Oh, it's great.  He just sits there and says exactly for fucking 15 minutes.  We're gonna have to get that on there.  Troy Kwan.  He's a paranoid schizophrenic.  Nice.  So he's on a lot of medication.  Is he really?  Yeah.  He hears voices in his head.  You know what I don't hear in my head?  Your walk-in music.  That's good timing.  He always has it ready for the after show.  Why was that not?  What are you doing, Iroh?  Iroh had one job today.  I haven't done it in a while.  To cue Troy's music.  That's it.  Iroh decided.  That's all we needed from you today, sir. 
[02:10:00]  What's he in there doing?  Well, I mean, I did see him earlier writing a fantasy card for SummerSlam.  Nice.  He just makes up like fantasy.  Fan fiction.  Yeah, he makes it.  Fan fiction.  Exactly.  He writes WWE fan fictions while the show's on.  Who got to meet the Biebs around here yesterday?  No.  Who was part of the top secret mission?  Just the talent department.  But who?  Hits won.  Who won Hits won?  Well, I guess Kid Kelly and Mikey Piff.  They got to hang with the Biebs last night?  They got to see him.  They got to probably record with him.  They keep it so quiet. 
[02:10:30]  He sneaks up in the other elevator.  The Sternivator?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Sternivator.  The Sternivator.  Not the Innovator.  To the Sternivator, Robin.  Woo-hoo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Troy, so that's it on Brian Wilson?  How was the interview with Ronnie B?  He's out of his mind.  Ronnie?  Yeah.  I'd love to talk to Brian Wilson.  Yeah, he's really out of it.  And the funny thing was because I was sitting there watching the whole thing, and as soon  as the interview was done, he was like, okay, you know, hey, Brian, thanks for coming 
[02:11:00]  by.  And Brian's like, no problem.  Just puts down his headphones and just walks out.  And they went to a commercial break, and he didn't even say goodbye.  No goodbye, no pictures, none of that.  And he just walked out.  Did you take a picture with him or no?  We did outside there, yeah.  What do you know about the 50-year anniversary tour thing they're doing?  It seems like that Brian Wilson has nothing to do with the new music.  Seems like that someone else sang the Brian Wilson part, and it seems like they just put  him in front of a mic that's not on.  That's what I just looked at on TV. 
[02:11:30]  I heard a clunker note that seemed like it was coming out of him, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So maybe he's just singing along with another voice?  Yeah.  He was not singing the lead on that.  There's no fucking way.  What do you know?  I'm pretty sure that's his band.  He put that band together to do Pet Sounds, because he did Pet Sounds live, start to finish.  No, those are the guys.  We recognize them from all the years.  Those were the bitch boys.  But they also threw-  No, the main guys, but the backing band are-  Yeah, they threw a couple other guys in there that really know what they're doing.  That's obvious, too.  The last time I saw Brian Wilson live, he just basically just sat there in front of his keyboard, 
[02:12:00]  not even playing it, just his hands like this.  Yeah, that's what he was doing.  His hands were just laying on the keyboard just now.  Oh, he's fucking gone.  And he's just kind of babbling.  The shot they're showing, you don't even know where he is on the stage.  What song are they doing now?  There's 10 people.  Oh, I'm sure they're going to go for a hit.  Hey, I'm going to stir him to playing drums for them.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ah, playing drums, bro.  All right.  All right, where's Brian Wilson?  Yeah, he's not doing a dead, dead.  Where is he?  He's to the left.  Oh, you see him?  He's behind the pillar.  He's just kind of sitting there. 
[02:12:30]  Landon's showing beach balls.  It's Joe Rogan.  Where's Brian Wilson?  He's way to the left.  He's behind that pillar, for real.  He's behind the glass.  They're burying him.  He's so crazy.  Yeah.  Ah, they just had fun, huh?  Oh, wait.  He's singing.  He's not playing. 
[02:13:00]  That's him.  That was him.  All the other guys got that note.  He doesn't have that note.  No, no.  He doesn't have that one.  What makes that sound?  Oh, that fucking synthesizer sound.  It's a filament.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That shit sounds pretty good. 
[02:13:30]  It does sound pretty goddamn good.  Well, you know they're adding a lot of shit, right?  Troy?  You know they're shit.  Yeah, I mean, I've seen them.  What's that?  What are you picking up on?  I mean, that's Brian Wilson's band.  I've seen them do that live.  They did Smile Start to Finish.  And they're really good.  They're incredible.  Hey, you know what else, though?  They got other guys playing various keyboard things and guitar players and stuff, and they're  all mic'd, so those harmonies, they could sound full because it's not just the Beach Boy  guys.  Right.  It's everybody in there throwing in nice full harmonies. 
[02:14:00]  And I'm sure everything's auto-corrected.  I mean, they have the processing and everything that they use nowadays.  Sounds pretty goddamn good.  That's the way I do it, man.  I sing live right on the sing.  That's it.  Ronnie said when Brian Wilson was in here, while the interview was happening, there'd be  these moments where he'd have eye contact, and they were right there together, and he  was having a conversation, and then randomly, he would just ask a follow-up question, and  Brian would go, no.  Wow, that's so much fun.  And so he'd just have to restart again. 
[02:14:30]  I'd love to hear this.  Just off and on and off and on.  Can you find us an example of this?  Yeah, maybe you can find a...  I just want to hear maybe a minute of Ron interviewing Brian Wilson now.  Oh, Def Leppard's on!  Def Leppard!  Oh, shit.  Let's go to Def Leppard.  It's Music Friday.  All right, what are they singing?  Oh, move the mic.  I can't see.  Back to Def Leppard.  Oh, thank you.  Here we go.  Let's see how quickly they cut away from him.  Obama, what? 
[02:15:00]  This is a big hit right here.  No one's even moving.  Big hit.  When this kicks in, everyone's just going to go crazy.  Come on.  Come on.  Listen to the crowd.  Yeah!  Come on now.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh, boy.  He's trying to get him going.  Oh, boy.  Yeah!  One guy who's actually a fan.  Motherfucker!  Oh, he's trying to put a show on for 20 people. 
[02:15:30]  He's got a crank in here, too.  You see the sidewalk next to him where people are actually able to comfortably walk to work?  Yeah, just walk by.  They're like, yeah, I've got to get to work.  Oh, look, Def Leppard.  They just keep walking by.  But you know what?  He's just singing and they're playing.  Yeah, yeah.  Real rock stars.  Yeah.  True.  I want to hear if they let him even get up to the fucking chorus or cut him off for a fucking J.G. Wentworth commercial.  I think they're trying to wait to the hook. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Who's he asking to sing along?  Wow, I wouldn't have done that.  There's only 100 people playing.  I know.  Probably should have taken that vocal there.  Look at the Fox people.  Ah, look at the Fox people.  He's rocking to it. 
[02:16:30]  We've got to fill up this crowd.  Get in there.  I'm the host.  Get in there.  O'Reilly's in there.  Got to fill up those dead spots.  Hannity's in there.  Hannity, get in there.  Combs.  You stay in the back.  Combs.  We've got half of Greta's face in there.  The drummer only had one arm.  Oh, man.  I didn't know that.  No idea.  How about you just make special shirts?  Stop tucking in your sleeves.  It's crazy.  Def Leppard people are fucking sexually abusing Bieber people on 6th Avenue. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Hey, how come the Leppard can't hear?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  There's the one-armed drummer guy.  There's a lot of space between those people.  How about you shoot him from the other angle?  Yeah, I know, right?  He got busted for beating his wife.  That's the best part about that.  One hand.  Wow.  How bad of a fighter is she?  Amazing.  Who's he married to?  Hillary Swank?  In the movie?  Just keep getting on his left side.  Foxy?  Just go to his left side.  Yes.  I like that, but they stuck with their drummer, though. 
[02:17:30]  And, you know.  Pour some sugar on me.  And Fox let him play, so that's good.  Yeah.  In the end.  The girl's on the phone holding up her phone.  She's like, listen.  Here they are.  I don't know if some band is out.  I don't know who they are.  I don't know if it's going to work.  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  At least you know if you're in the audience for this, you'll definitely be on TV.  There's Neil Cavuto rocking.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  There's Shepard Smith.  Rob Bartlett is dressed up as Hulk Hogan rocking out on the ground.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  Chris Everett looks pretty good up top there, huh?  The tennis great.  Oh, that's Chris Everett.  Chris Everett.  She was hot back in the day, but she held up pretty good.  Here we go.  This is the big part here.  Hey, man.  Hey, man. 
[02:18:30]  That's the show on the Fox the morning, guys.  Like, he's just, his head's going up and down in his beige suit.  Very awkwardly.  Sarah?  What are they doing?  They just cut him off again.  Sarah?  That's the same channel.  Why can't they figure out how to finish this song? 
[02:19:00]  You know what?  Also, the end of the song is when the people would be like, yeah, and make it seem exciting.  What a terrible fucking job of not even fading out.  There wasn't even a graphic that says more to come.  That's terrible.  No bumpers.  There wasn't even a bump.  There's a cricket loans commercial.  Wow.  That's great.  Brutal.  They're terrible.  Sarah?  Right?  Sarah?  I hope Def Leppard is taping this so they can watch the broadcast.  Jesus.  Oh, they're going to be, they're not going to be happy.  No.  You know how mad I'd be if that was Sabbath?  Do you know how out of my mind I'd be? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, I would love to hear that.  That's great.  What are they doing?  He'd be so mad.  Why would he be down there?  Yeah.  Wouldn't be fucking here.  No.  That's true.  We'll break.  We're going to get to the final testimony from the Jerry Sandusky truck.  Y'all, there's some more.  The rape one.  The headliner.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  We're going to get to the final one.  I think it's the final one as far as these guys testify.  As tattletales go.  Hey.  Yep. 
[02:20:00]  I like to sing, man.  I'll sing a little bit.  Everyone's watching.  To see what he will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh, everyone's wondering.  Will you come out tonight?  Everyone's trying to get it right. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, everyone's working for the weekend.  Everyone's working on the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  You want a piece of my heart? 
[02:21:00]  That's my favorite part.  Heading toward the weekend.  The big boy car.  That's right.  There was something we wanted to say before.  What the fuck were we talking about?  I don't know.  We just talked about some fun stuff.  Some fun stuff.  Brian Wilson.  Everyone's sending me links to the Ronnie B.  Brian Wilson interview.  We just want a quick highlight.  Yeah.  A highlight, if you will.  I think New York's working on that, so we'll have that in a minute.  But we got the final accuser in the Jerry Sandusky trial. 
[02:21:30]  Basically saying Jerry there forcibly raped him.  Yeah.  This one's a little more brutal than the rest.  He was trying to woo the rest of them with his gifts and his love.  But this one, he just took forcibly.  I like thinking about weird shit.  This is their closer, obviously.  So they had to line up all the victims and go,  Ah, you're like mid-show.  Yeah.  When people go for their pee breaks. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no.  You're the closer.  You're our stairway to heaven.  Yeah.  Ah, we'll open with you.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they actually had to do that and decide what spot for all these guys.  Basically saying, yeah, you were fucking molested, but not as bad as this one.  And this is the closer.  This is the one that had the bloody asshole, right?  Final prosecution witness in the child sexual abuse trial of former Penn State University assistant Jerry Sandusky  testified Thursday that Sandusky forcibly raped him on several occasions.  Wow. 
[02:22:30]  We got to remind people, by the way, that obviously we think all this is despicable.  People get confused because we make a few jokes and there's characters and all this shit involved.  This guy is a complete piece of shit.  Set up your nice there.  The 18-year-old man identified in the indictment as victim number nine, number nine, number nine,  testified that he cried out for help as Sandusky raped him in the basement of the Sandusky home.  That's right.  He's saying he raped him, but no one came to his assistance. 
[02:23:00]  Holy fuck.  He said he believed that the basement was soundproofed and that Sandusky's wife, Dottie, couldn't hear his pleas.  You're saying his name, Rob.  How did you say Sandusky?  Sandusky and Doody.  Sandusky and Doody?  Sandusky.  I'm a shitty reader to begin with and now I got to do this?  Fuck.  Afterward, Judge John Cleland announced that the prosecution had concluded its case and 
[02:23:30]  that the defense would begin Monday after a three-day break.  The man said he stayed overnight at Sandusky's house.  This is the shit I don't understand.  Right.  Stayed at his house between 50 and 100 times.  He said Sandusky began forcibly raping him beginning when he was maybe 13.  And I'm sure people will call up and explain why someone would stay in that environment 50 to 100 times.  I just don't know that world.  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  I would figure out a way to get the fuck out of that situation, no?  Tickets.  Free tickets. 
[02:24:00]  On some occasions, he said the assaults were so forceful that he would bleed from his anus.  Oh, yeah.  Winner.  He said he didn't seek medical attention.  Instead, I just dealt with it.  What was I going to do?  I mean, he was a big guy, the man said.  He was bigger than me at the time.  Way bigger than me.  Uh-oh.  No shit.  With the bloody asshole, we know.  Big man.  Big man.  See?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I didn't get it.  Want to explain further? 
[02:24:30]  The man said he told no one about the abuse, even police, when they began investigating,  because he thought no one would believe him.  He's an important guy.  He's a football coach, he said.  Who would believe kids?  God.  On cross-examination, the man acknowledged that despite the horrible things Sandusky did  to him, he continued to accept tickets to Penn State football games.  That's what they're asking these kids?  Well, they're trying to say that they're lying, because why would you accept tickets if this  happened?  Well, I guess they've got to try something, right? 
[02:25:00]  Well, you have to.  I mean...  Uh, from the defendant, as recently as last November, he said he did so because I had  a friend with me who had my back at the time.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  His name was Jerry Sandusky.  That was his other friend, Terry Mann Husky.  Get it?  Yeah.  I'm going to go get it.  Get it?  Yeah.  Some of the most bizarre evidence of the entire trial also emerged Thursday, including a short 
[02:25:30]  story Sandusky wrote that described his relationship with a boy who apparently attended his camps,  which was found in one of the boxes at Penn State.  In the story, which was read aloud in court, Sandusky refers to himself in the third person  as Jer.  Jer.  Yeah.  And to the boy by his first name.  Although Sandusky's alleged victims are being identified by name in court, NBC News and MSNBC.com  do not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults and have replaced a young man's name with 
[02:26:00]  X.  I like that he calls himself Jer, though.  I know.  He's in his own.  Putter Jer?  Need your driver, Jer?  Jer?  That's King Cody.  So we've got to make up a name here.  King comedy.  Come on.  I'm Jerry.  Jim Norton is a young man.  No, how about Chip?  What?  You want to go with Chip?  No.  Fuck.  All right, fine.  It's Friday.  I'm Jerry.  Chip is a young man.  Okay, man.  That's in Jer's life. 
[02:26:30]  Fucking hate you.  I got to start over now.  I got to start over now.  I'm Jerry.  Chip is a young man who came into Jer's life.  The story reads.  Later telling how Jer was distressed that the boy had broken off the relationship.  The story continues.  Tell me another story.  Jer has been replaced with I don't care. 
[02:27:00]  What?  I don't understand this, Ant.  It's Jerry talking about himself.  Like, tell me another story, Jer.  You don't care.  Tell him.  No, no, no.  It's like a little pop.  No, no, no.  Here's what happened.  Jerry is complaining that the kid...  Jerry's mad the kid's not keeping in touch with him.  Yep.  I'm Jerry.  Chip is a young man who came into Jerry's life.  He's talking about himself and their friendship.  Yeah.  The story reads.  Later, it's saying that he's distressed that the boy broke off this relationship.  Okay.  And this is Jerry writing. 
[02:27:30]  Tell me another story, Jer, has been replaced with I don't care.  This cloud has destroyed soccer.  This cloud has destroyed soccer, hockey, choked smiles and laughter.  There's fear that has reached his insides and is killing his feelings.  Meaning he's...  The kid who used to say, tell me a story, Jer, is now saying I don't care.  Oh, okay.  And the cloud.  And he's growing hair.  His hiney used to be bear.  But I'd be happy to pay for some nair if he'd let me put my hands in his underwear and 
[02:28:00]  cum in his asshole.  Sure.  He needs some stitches there.  Oh, I know.  Life ain't fair.  You're a boy and I'm a bear.  Just use some shout in that underwear.  Your anal lining has a tear.  Don't tell Colin he doesn't give a care.  Oh, don't tell your father.  He'll surely glare. 
[02:28:30]  Now let me patch that derriere.  Don't lick just one ball.  I've got a pear.  It's filled with cream like an egg, Claire.  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  Fucking Sandusky and his dumb palms.  Come on.  This would have been better.  This guy's a class act.  Oh, put on the cartoons.  I'll have sex with you during savoir-faire.  It's everywhere.  Jesus.  Oh.  Oh.  You'll look.  Oh.  I'll make you walk like her.  No.  God.  I'll have you walking like the cousin.  You can't get it.  I'll fuck you so hard.  I'll have you walking like the cousin of Blair.  Oh, wow. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, that was.  That's great.  God damn it.  A. Claire was the best.  There was another one, too.  Another.  Oh, derriere.  Yeah, we did an area.  You'll weep every time you look at a chair.  Yes, this butt plug's shaped like a pear. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Well, then it just ends.  Germ might not be worthy.  Yuck, yuck.  Pussy hair.  There's the smell of copper in the air.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  There's come for all.  Wanna share?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'll fuck you from Timbuktu to Zaire. 
[02:30:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  That's starting to sound like Dr. Seuss.  Your ass looks like chopped meat, very rare.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, it's kind of a Dr. Seuss thing, isn't it?  Joe might not be worthy, but he needs a best friend.  and that's how it ends.  Jer.  Stupid Jer.  He needs a best friend.  What a fucking creep.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:31:00]  Let's get Dottie involved in this case, though.  Yeah, Dottie definitely needs to...  Derriere.  Dottie really needs to fucking go down on this one.  Derriere.  Derriere.  Derriere.  He loves boy ass.  Oh, he loves boy ass.  Loves it.  Oh, cock.  He loves to cock the fucking legs.  Yeah.  Legs.  Oh, he's a dirty fellow.  Yeah.  Dottie, dottie.  Yeah.  Filthy man.  Oh, my goodness.  I guess the case is going to get boring next week. 
[02:31:30]  I guess it's more of the technical stuff and who saw what, who knew what.  Is Sandusky taking the stand?  I doubt it.  What the hell could he say?  He probably wants to.  That interview he did, he's not very good.  No kidding.  Kicking on his feet like that.  No kidding.  Young boys were out.  We got a man who called 911 there over a sandwich.  A sandwich.  We get these every once in a while.  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches. 
[02:32:00]  Sandwich.  Yeah, they got something wrong so they feel like they got to call 911 to take care of the problem.  Isn't this shit that everyone knows?  Like, you don't call 911?  You would think.  You would think.  They just keep doing it.  Does the guy sound drunk or anything?  Was he wasted?  I haven't heard this one yet, Adam.  Does he sound like he could be a smart man?  You might not have heard me.  I haven't heard this one.  How long is he talking about?  This is rhetorical questions.  I know.  Let's find out together.  Yes!  911 over a sandwich. 
[02:32:30]  Sandwiches are pretty simple, right?  Not that controversial.  Cheese, meat, bread.  They got to do this.  Do they have to?  Do they just be a real dude on the TV?  Sandwiches!  Is it right?  Meat, bread, sometimes some mustard.  Maybe some mayo.  I like a good pumpernickel.  Why wouldn't you just start with,  holy shit, this asshole called 911 because the sandwich was wrong.  I watch that show every fucking night.  Yeah, you don't have to establish what a sandwich is.  Sandwiches are pretty simple, right?  Not that controversial. 
[02:33:00]  Cheese, meat, bread.  We get it.  But one man got so fired up about his sandwich not being to his specifications  that he called 911 on the deli here that made it.  He ordered in the phone 14 sandwiches, but he said to put a little bit less meat, but  extra, extra cheese.  What I did, and then he didn't want to pay for it.  East Hartford grateful deli owner Tila Ozenhera told customer Rother McLennan that she couldn't  take back the sandwiches because he special ordered them.  And that didn't sit well in Rother's stomach, so he asked Tila for her phone and called 911. 
[02:33:30]  I specifically asked for...  It sounded like it.  Here's a dumb 911 call.  Specifically asked for, um, little, um, turkey and little, um, um, ham and, um, a lot of  cheese and a lot of mayonnaise, and they gave me a hard time with one and he stopped by.  The East Hartford dispatcher used to getting calls about fires and fallen trees, now getting 
[02:34:00]  a call about too much meat, not enough cheese.  You're calling 911 because you don't like the way that they're making your sandwich?  Exactly.  Tylon Culver is...  He says this isn't the first time Rother has called the cops to report something not  to his liking.  He called the police on me, too.  He said I tried to, uh, our building is brick.  He said I tried to, uh, burn the building down, you know, with a drill.  Turns out our complaining cheese connoisseur has a soft, doughy side. 
[02:34:30]  I think the customer realized how wrong he was, so this morning he called in to apologize,  and he said, uh, he, he gonna come back, but not anytime soon.  America's doomed.  But Tuftila has a warning for future problematic patrons.  If you call Grateful Daily, put a water in, you better come and pick it up and pay for  it.  Yeah, damn you.  Not call 911.  Right, and not call 911.  Obviously, this story elicits a chuckle or two, but seriously, cops remind everyone not 
[02:35:00]  to use 911 unless it is a true emergency.  Yeah, you needed to be reminded of that?  Yeah, no kidding.  What an idiot.  What an idiot.  Oh, gosh.  Do we have that sound clip?  What sound clip?  Are you talking about this?  That was it?  That's Bugs Bunny rolling the dice.  Yep.  But Jimmy used to imitate that.  But I was a kid.  I didn't remember it.  You couldn't watch it on video back then.  But how do you do it? 
[02:35:30]  Ching-chung.  I was right.  I only had the eating meanie part right.  Yeah.  What the hell does that even mean, Bugs?  What's he doing?  Why is Boba on the line?  Oh, well, apparently he said he was going to call today.  He was on the line all day yesterday and no one picked up.  You hear what he's doing for the 4th of July?  No. 
[02:36:00]  He's having a bobo queue.  Nice.  I don't know.  He's having a bobo queue, a party at his house.  But apparently his yard can fit like eight people,  but there's a giant above-the-ground inflatable pool in the yard,  so there's room for nobody.  Nobody.  Are people really going?  I don't know.  I know he has issues.  Let's be honest with each other.  Really?  I finally had to block him, officially.  I blocked him, too.  I had to.  I'm hanging in, but I will at some point. 
[02:36:30]  I officially blocked him two years ago.  I was like, I just couldn't do it anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  My entire timeline.  They just babble.  And I finally had to block him.  I felt sad about it because I know there's something going on.  Well, he called with a story.  He's not just calling now.  He's got a topic.  It's a story about a neighbor driving his mother nuts.  Bobo, I blocked you, officially.  Oh, great.  Now I can't read your tweet.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. 
[02:37:00]  He feels bad about it.  I begged you.  I begged you over and over again.  I'm like, please, stop.  You just wouldn't stop.  I won't, all right?  I had a separate timeline thing to read all the tweets from the show.  Well, I don't know what to tell you.  My tweets aren't that great anyway, so you're not missing anything.  I blocked you, too, Bobo.  Yeah, there's a lot of blocking going on because of you, Bobo.  I'm ready, too.  And I'm actually blocking people that are adding you to ad mentions, too.  I have to. 
[02:37:30]  What do you got today, Bobo?  All right, well...  Can you do your Chicago Bob, first of all?  I heard you do a Chicago Bob.  Or Bobo, or whatever the fuck.  Yes, this is Chicago Bobo.  I don't know.  I'm not lying.  Yeah, I got a girlfriend that'll take my virginity, but there's only one problem.  He said she would only take it when the Cubs win the World Series.  Ah, that's pretty good.  Right?  He's like a stand-up. 
[02:38:00]  Where's the accent, though?  Well, it's Chicago Bobo.  It's not fair.  How come he steals every one of my bits?  He looks up to you.  He steals every one of my bits.  You need to bring him back to the compound.  No, he was there once.  He shan't return.  You don't want him back?  No.  He was in good behavior, right?  Oh, God.  He at least kept his clothes on, didn't he?  No.  Oh.  He was thrown in the pool naked, I believe.  Actually, he was in the pool in his tighty-whities. 
[02:38:30]  His tighty-whities were cut off with the parasitics.  Right, that was it.  Did you drain the pool?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's been drained.  Oh, okay.  That was a couple of seasons ago.  You got rid of a couch because of one booger.  I would assume you have to drain the pool.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If Bobo was in it naked.  Drain the pool.  Got a fucking muriatic acid scrub.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  That was great.  Thanks.  Bobo.  Oh, no.  That was great.  Thanks.  I wanted to hear the story about his neighbor.  Yeah, he didn't get into it at all.  And his mom.  All right, call back at 10. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, but that's not parsing Sam.  He'll accept that call.  You guys will be good.  I don't want to do this shit, Joe.  Yeah, he doesn't.  He thinks he's above doing the after show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, after show.  That's right.  Hey, apparently Loverboy is not above it, but Bobo is.  I love when Loverboy's on.  I like calling in for those shows.  Maybe you can get Def Leppard.  Yeah, you might be able to, right?  Maybe you can fix the hearing or something.  Oh, good one.  Stop making those jokes.  That's a good one, Joe.  How come the panther can't hear too good, Dita? 
[02:39:30]  Well, I got to say something about Sam Roberts and the new young Roberts family.  Uh, I got a thank you card already.  Crazy.  So who the fuck is that about?  That's crazy.  And it was postmarked from Connecticut.  Now, what were these things made and mailed out the night of the wedding?  Yep.  Was it postmarked from Connecticut?  It certainly was.  I wouldn't know.  Oh, you know why?  Because that's where Jess's work is.  So she would have sent them from work.  Oh, okay.  But wow, that's quick. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  That was pretty fast.  You guys just decided to get this done.  Not you guys.  It's all her, right?  Whose handwriting did it look like?  Oh, it did not look like yours.  Yeah, that was the plane rides to and from Bermuda.  She is on the spot.  She likes to get her tasks done quickly.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Very good.  Amazing.  Ronnie B., Brian Wilson, you get it, E-Rock?  Yeah, we have a clip.  It's about 33 seconds.  That's it?  Well, the interview was like 47 minutes, so.  That's it? 
[02:40:30]  Why don't we play 31 minutes of the interview?  All right, because that would put you exactly, well, I'd put you at 9.59.  Perfect.  Yeah.  We'll just do the 33 seconds.  It's topical.  Is it?  It's topical, though.  Brian Wilson on the TV.  We play Ronnie B.'s interview.  Perfect.  Not perfect.  And we start our weekends.  I agree.  Oh, yeah.  All right, what do you got there, E-Rock?  He's talking to you.  Sore feet?  I mean, my Rolodex in my head was spinning for a fat joke. 
[02:41:00]  But you're like, which one haven't I used?  I'm like, ah.  Fogged arteries?  Fuck, no.  I used that one.  Yeah, I used that one.  Worn out teeth?  Fuck, no.  Believe me.  Because I didn't say it, it's not for a lack of trying.  What do you think of?  I don't know.  I was like, what do you got, E-Rock?  And it's like, ah.  Numb toes?  Yeah, something.  I couldn't put one together.  I was trying to think of some kind of food joke.  But something in his mouth.  Exactly.  Fucking tuna fish in his pocket. 
[02:41:30]  Mayonnaise leaking from his asshole.  Olean burps.  E-Rock, you enjoy those jokes.  A house full of broken scales.  A game hen caught between his teeth.  Sorry, E-Rock.  You know, E-Rock can't handle glutens.  I heard that yesterday.  You don't know that.  He, for some reason now, he's a gluten intolerant.  That's a very hip thing to be now. 
[02:42:00]  That's what Eric is.  It's just a, you need some gluten.  I don't think I am.  Gluten free.  No, no, no.  Someone told him he was a glutton.  And he misunderstood.  He gets Tony upset three to four times a week.  And his wife is tired of him shitting and having horrible shits.  So she's been talking to him about it.  Oh, no.  Do you have horrible shits, E-Rock?  Yeah.  They're not good.  What's wrong with them?  No, it's just...  You know, his wife couldn't take a shower the morning after the wedding because the shower 
[02:42:30]  was full of towels that were stained with E-Rock's shit.  Oh, God.  What?  Is this true?  It's terrible.  We talked about this.  I don't remember.  The Monday after his wedding.  E-Rock is also sit-up intolerant.  Cigars and scotch.  Very funny.  They asked what kind of adhesive holds up E-Rock.  Gluten.  Gluten.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[02:43:00]  Lovely.  Lovely.  So what's the Brian Wilson clip?  It's always bad.  Oh, the clip.  Right.  He's talking about songwriting.  Now, for you yourself being a songwriter.  Yes.  Do you think when you're going through some of these songs, like when you hear these songs,  do you think about the songwriter, you being a songwriter yourself?  Not really.  No.  No.  You just take it as face value of the song. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  One of the things that I thought that you did really interesting here was I Loves You,  Porgy, where you sang from that point of view of the one.  I loves you, Porgy, don't let him take me.  I think it's a beautiful tune.  Okay.  So.  It's not bad.  I mean, it's just.  Yeah, that was kind of, I guess.  What a terrible example.  What an example of an awkward moment.  That wasn't awkward.  It wasn't terribly awkward. 
[02:44:00]  No, it wasn't that awkward.  Ron was asking him questions like that didn't require big answers.  It wasn't like he asked him to expand on something.  He was kind of like, oh, so you think this?  No, no, no.  No, no.  I didn't feel that that was awkward.  And then he started singing.  All right.  Oh, here they come.  Nice work, E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Unless there had been some kind of context where it was like we start with a longer answer  and then all of a sudden he's doing short.  Of course, but he's never been a good example provider.  Oh, I'm going to say that.  It's E-Rock's love song, I love you, Porky. 
[02:44:30]  No, it was Forgy.  Forgy.  He's clip intolerant.  You're getting hammered over here.  Bobo, what's the problem, Bobo?  Bobo.  What's the problem?  Bobo.  Yeah?  What's the problem?  I hear you're mad now or something.  Problem?  Oh, no, I was upset right, Anthony.  First of all, I promised that I'd hate myself if you invite me to your house.  You always get naked. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, but I'm not.  You've gotten naked every time you've been at my house.  I'm not going to do that.  That was only once I did that.  I'll never do that again.  I promise.  You do it every time.  Every time.  Yeah, but I'm not going to.  I promise.  I promise.  Oh, God.  We're stressing out the ronk.  I'm the grave of my father.  I don't know, Bobo.  You did get naked last time.  Yeah, but I do.  I swear on the life of my mother.  Well, he's gotten naked 100% of the time he's been there.  He's swearing on the life of his mother.  Well, you know, Bobo, getting naked's a bad thing, 
[02:45:30]  and you just seem to like to do it,  so I would have to vote no.  Bobo, it's 100% of the times you've been at my house,  you've gotten naked.  You can't put up with that.  Oh, but I'm not going to do that.  I promise.  I swear.  Well, you promised, but you did it every other time.  I did.  I really do promise.  I swear in the life of my mother and my favorite uncle,  my Uncle Louie.  I swear on his wife.  Uncle Louie.  I swear on Mr. Maloonigan's.  Oh, boy.  And I swear on Mr. Maloonigan and Rosie.  What kind of dog is Mr. Maloonigan? 
[02:46:00]  What is he?  I've got two dogs.  You people forget I've got two dogs.  Well, what kind of dog is Mr. Maloonigan?  You already know Mr. Maloonigan's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  A beagle and a schnoodle.  What's this?  You have a beagle and what's the other dog?  A schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  Hey, what's going on with the neighbor and your mom?  Go ahead.  Go.  Funny, humorous anecdote. 
[02:46:30]  Go.  Well, I can tell you, neighbors,  these Russian neighbors are driving my mother nuts.  Russian.  Why are they in such a hurry, bulbs?  Them and their magnetic trays and real linen napkins.  They make sexy for the monies.  Can't do it.  Of course.  Just keep going.  They never listen to my mother, 
[02:47:00]  which he says not to constantly use the washer and dryer.  He should be at worststoriesever.com with this one.  Really?  He's terrible.  Put him on book radio.  Tell him a cold book radio.  What if I had a good punchline?  Which would be a gunshot.  Hey, remember the Stanley Cup thing?  The Kings won the thing.  You sure?  I'm sure. 
[02:47:30]  One of the L.A. Kings didn't give a fuck it was being broadcasted and needed to curse.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, it's great.  Yeah, they're potty mouths.  Those are L.A. Kings.  Well, as we've been showing you, the L.A. Kings are being crowned today.  The celebration going on right now inside Staples Center.  Jonathan Quick, goaltender and MVP.  Interesting to see him out there in his shorts this afternoon.  Instead of in his normal uniform, he does have his jersey on.  Let's go ahead and listen in.  Thank you so much. 
[02:48:00]  How about this fucking team right here?  Oh, boy.  How about this fucking team right now?  That's great.  After the great TV setup.  How about this fucking team right here?  Oh, they're all panicky, I bet, in the studio.  I'll tell you, four years ago, we were getting beat by Detroit, Eason 2, and the support we had back then. 
[02:48:30]  And now, we're beating Detroit, and we're beating New Jersey.  And to see this, 18,000 here, you guys, you guys have been unbelievable. 
[02:49:00]  I can't thank you enough.  The team can't thank you enough.  Jonathan Quick, the goaltender and the winner of the Khan Smythe Trophy, the playoff MVP, speaking this afternoon.  Of course, he did use a four-letter word there, and if you heard it, we apologize.  We did try to get in.  We just weren't quick enough on the button this afternoon, so we apologize if we offended anyone out there.  It wasn't that you weren't quick enough on the button.  You didn't try.  Stop fucking lying.  You would have heard it if you would have tried.  We can handle fuck by now.  Don't worry. 
[02:49:30]  A four-letter word.  How old are you?  Right.  A four-letter word.  Oops.  Say a curse.  A cuss.  However you want to say it.  Inappropriate language, something.  Whatever you want to fucking say.  Or don't acknowledge it at all.  Love is a four-letter word.  I wouldn't acknowledge it.  I would just let it go, right?  It's a hippie gym.  Oh.  You don't even have to acknowledge it.  It's what it is.  I was saying earlier, I was watching those goddamn helmet cam videos from Afghanistan, where the  guys are just, they're in firefights. 
[02:50:00]  It's amazing.  And, uh, but one thing war movies don't portray accurately in the movies is the constant use  of fuck and shit.  The amount of curses.  In battle.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It's all they're saying the whole fucking time that they're shooting is, oh, fuck.  Fuck.  Get on the fucking side.  Shit.  Where's that fucking coming from?  Fuck.  Constantly cursing.  Do you got a good one that we can play real fast?  I think, um, probably Afghanistan, uh, firefight, uh, helmet cam, part one. 
[02:50:30]  That was a good one.  And boy, they look just like Hall of Duty.  It's amazing.  The part one part and everything?  Part one.  You really remember this?  Part one.  Okay.  Uh, is...  Firefight.  Is that it?  Part one.  Yeah.  On helmet cam.  Yeah.  In Afghanistan.  Part one.  Holy shit.  That's it.  All right.  Guy's got the saw out.  He's fucking laying down some fucking suppressing fire.  Rat, tat, tat.  Ratty, tatty, tat, tat.  It's crazy. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, boy.  Viewer discretion is advised.  Yeah.  Yeah, this one, uh...  There it is.  Look at this shit.  Look at this guy fires these rounds.  It's just like Call of Duty.  It's fucked up.  It's just laying shit into the tree line.  And the comments are great because they're just people that think they know everything.  And he's got to reload.  I am reloading!  Imagine being in this situation. 
[02:51:30]  No way.  The anticipation of getting shot would be fucking...  Like, how do you function in that?  Just being like, ah, bullet's gonna hit me!  Ah, bullet's gonna hit me!  That would be the one thing I'd be constantly thinking.  What are they going with?  The GoPro?  It looks like GoPro, doesn't it?  They got some GoPros.  GoPro cams.  Imagine if you had that kind of technology for D-Day.  Imagine watching this shit.  Like, during... 
[02:52:00]  Yeah!  What's it at?  They don't know where they are.  They have a couple of these nice, lightweight machine guns.  And they just rake the friggin' tree line with it.  Give the other guys enough time to poke their head up and try to aim and shoot accurately.  These guys just sweep with the machine guns.  But how can they see?  There's nothing to see.  That's just it.  You gotta sweep with the machine gun and try to keep the enemy's head down.  And then the other guys with the scopes on their rifles, 
[02:52:30]  they look to the tree line to try to find the actual targets.  That guy's just firing like a madman.  How much does each bullet cost?  Oh, man.  Wow.  You know what's gonna suck about being in that situation?  You don't even know in the end if you hit anyone.  Yeah, yeah.  In some of these situations, you have no idea.  Unless you recon.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then you gotta be brave enough to do that.  It's insanity.  God bless these guys, man.  Unbelievable. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  They just don't know.  Which one?  The way you were shooting up, bitch.  All right.  Where's it at?  And they start shooting back at him.  He's like, fuck.  Yeah.  There you go.  There?  Yeah.  I guess they're launching some grenades over to see where.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  He's like, what the fuck?  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:53:30]  Look at all the fucking rounds he's throwing out.  It's just amazing.  And what's this for?  Like, what?  It's like, ah, ha, we trying to take something here?  What's up?  What's up?  What the fuck?  He says that every time they shoot back at him.  What are they supposed to do?  Are you loading?  They all have helmet cams at?  I don't know if they all do.  That's a good quality cameraman.  Yeah, they've gotten to the point where they can get a nice, lightweight, good quality camera 
[02:54:00]  that isn't obtrusive on the soldiers.  So you're seeing a lot of this shit that's going on now in real war.  That's an amazing, amazing fucking show.  It's crazy.  Quality.  It goes loading up.  It's a fucking pain in the ass loading those swords.  Then they start running out of ammo.  Really?  Yeah.  It's fucking nuts.  That is great quality, though.  And it does, it's amazing how much it looks like a video game.  But man, that anticipation, though, that, that, you ever get your back turned around 
[02:54:30]  and dodgeball, and you're like scared to turn around because you know you'd just get hit  in the face the second you look again?  That would be that feeling all the time.  Just waiting for a bullet to fucking catch you in the face.  Does he have fuck on his knuckle?  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, he's got fuck spelt on his knuckles.  It's, it's a language that real people use in real situations.  Well, go full screen.  What's wrong with you?  They're fucking shooting.  Of course, it's war. 
[02:55:00]  I'm going to check these out over here.  Yeah, there's a lot of them, and they're really fucking.  I'm down to let my last 400.  Click here to watch part two.  What happens in part two?  Last 400 rounds.  What's that?  What happens in part two?  They realize.  I haven't seen part two yet.  What happens, Jim?  They realize that they learn a little something from each other, and they do a cop buddy thing.  Oh, no.  We were shooting at each other.  Then we realized that we're really buddies together. 
[02:55:30]  Fucking Sandler.  Jesus.  Just come in here.  The guy to this machine gunner's left, he just holds the gun over his head and shoots over the wall.  He's the smart guy.  He's like, fuck that.  I am not poking my head up.  This guy's ballsy, man.  He pokes his head right above the wall.  Well, that's just his helmet.  And starts shooting.  When he starts shooting, though, he fucking puts his head right above the wall.  Look at this.  He's up above the wall right there.  He's looking.  That guy, too. 
[02:56:00]  All right, watch out.  I'm fired.  Craziness.  They're shooting up that hill.  That'd be scary.  And you hear and see if a couple of rounds hit behind him on the wall.  They are definitely being shot at.  That's a lot of ammunition. 
[02:56:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, see that guy?  He's like, fuck that.  I'll hold it over my head.  That's a firefighter, right?  Yeah.  This is just the real fucking deal right there.  Do they got to do paperwork for every bullet?  Imagine that.  I fired my 856th bullet at a gentleman that was behind a tree. 
[02:57:00]  By the way, Jimmy's got to help me out with this.  Last night, yesterday on the way home, Kenny.  Kenny has a new trick he does.  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  You know.  You know.  Like, the back of your hand, I like to be in uncomfortable situations.  Kenny's new thing when he drops me off.  Like, yesterday, I decided to go to the gym after work.  So he's dropping me off.  He stops in the crosswalk.  Well, it's walk.  Oh, no.  Now, right in front of my face is a woman. 
[02:57:30]  Like, what the fuck?  Like, he won't pull through.  Right, right.  And there's plenty of room, by the way.  It's not even a situation whatsoever.  And what did he say to her yesterday?  He's got to get out, miss.  He's handicapped.  Jesus, looking at me.  What an asshole.  It's so uncomfortable.  That's great.  And her face is pretty much pressed up against the window where I'm sitting.  It's just awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. 
[02:58:00]  And then yesterday, he just pulls up your truck and stops in the middle of traffic.  Oh, I saw that yesterday.  I heard Jimmy go, why didn't you pull in?  Right.  There was plenty of room to pull out.  Yeah, there's plenty of room to the left.  To go around.  People are beeping.  Oh, and then he beeped the horn once.  And Jimmy had me howling going through the scenario that he has to now go home and account for the beep.  Yes.  With paperwork and why he did it.  Beep number 734 occurred. 
[02:58:30]  I like to count beeps because the warranty guarantees $50,000.  He rarely.  Do I see a smile on his face?  No, not at all.  He's probably trying to frown, but his face made a mistake.  You know, mark the date.  It was June 14th.  Who's mark the date?  Coming in later.  June 14th was the first time he used his horn this year.  It was.  Wow.  Yes, and we've been in some situations where we yell at him.  He doesn't like using that horn.  We yell at him.  No.  We're like, fucking beep.  I don't want to wear it out. 
[02:59:00]  I know.  I can't wait until his car gets hit or sideswiped because he refuses to use a horn.  He didn't beep the horn.  He has to fucking repaint it.  Oh, and then I hope if it does happen, something fucks up and the horn sticks during the accident.  He's just sitting there.  This guy has been in a firefight.  Oh.  You know, Joe, God bless you.  No joke.  I don't even know how you do this shit.  That's craziness.  What do you got there, buddy?  The throwing frag's out now. 
[02:59:30]  Guy's got to fuck it.  Look at it.  It's helmet cam.  That's not nice, Anthony.  He's throwing.  Not fat.  Sort of frag.  Yeah, they're throwing grenades over the wall.  Wow.  The guy's like, fuck this, and just goes, give me one of those.  Why over the wall?  Where are they going?  Across into the wood line.  They're trying to get it into the bushes and trees.  They can't throw that far, can they?  Probably not.  How close are they?  They're fun to throw, I would gather.  Yeah, you've got to throw a few of those.  Yeah, you've got to shake these people up a little bit.  Joe, could you add to our conversation?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  What's up? 
[03:00:00]  Hey, yeah, I did Iraq four times.  I went to Afghanistan once in Helmand province with 2nd Battalion National Marines.  And throwing frags is fucking cool as shit.  Like, when you're getting shot at and stuff like that, it's not really scary.  It's a rush.  And it's just fucking awesome.  Those stupid fucking talips, they start lighting you up from like 300 meters out, and you're just going up to the 240.  But the best is when you get really close and you take that, like, 66-millimeter lop and just launch a fucking rocket out of them and they just lose their minds. 
[03:00:30]  Really?  That sounds fucking crazy.  But you're not thinking about a bullet fucking smashing into your face?  No, it's not like you're really nervous about it.  You're worried about your boys.  And so, like, I'm a sergeant, so when I go out, I go out with, like, 12 guys.  And you're worried about them because they're, like, hanging their heads around the wall and doing stupid shit.  You're like, get your fucking head down, retard.  Oh, that's not politically correct.  Oh, wow, you should be looking out for that.  But it's awesome.  It's so much fun.  I'm getting out of the Marine Corps in three months, and it's going to suck.  But, I mean, it's a lot of fun. 
[03:01:00]  But afterwards, you have a cigarette, and you're like, holy shit.  But then you've got to do all the goddamn paperwork afterwards, too, like you guys are talking about.  There is paperwork, yeah.  That's fucking weird.  I don't know how you go back to regular society after being in, like, a firefight like we're watching right now.  You have six society.  Next thing you know, you've got to deal with, like, the crap we deal with.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it's...  You should have a car to get you out of most situations, I'm thinking.  You should never have to deal with a speeding ticket, at the very least. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, I mean, it is what it is.  Like, we've got to play by the rules, stuff like that.  But, like, my mom will call me.  She'll be, like, bitching about, like, she's like, oh, my phone doesn't stop ringing at work.  I'm like, I just got shot at four times a day, and you fucking care about your phone ringing too much?  Yeah, right.  Wow.  Watching these videos, though, it really does give you some perspective.  That's some crazy shit.  If you want to see, there's another one that's called Turf Wars.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, and that's when we were down in Marja. 
[03:02:00]  And it's 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, Echo Company, and it's one of the other squad leaders that I was down there with.  And it's just funny shit, because, like, the guys are, like, running...  You'll see the Afghans, and they're not the best shots, to say the least.  Like, they're shooting, like, you know, over the top, stuff like that.  And the Marines are, like, you know, engaged in proper shooting positions and landing fire and maneuvering.  Yeah, they really don't...  For the most part, I guess the opposition doesn't really have that good a training.  So, you know, you guys probably got the jump on them, I would think. 
[03:02:30]  Well, the Pakistani guys and, like, the Hakawi Network guys and shit like that...  Hakawis? Those are from F Troop.  Were they really?  Yeah, the Hakawi Indians, because they were lost, and they said, where the Hakawi?  Oh, my God, you got to go?  Yes.  Oh, I got to go.  Oh, Jimmy, okay.  No, no, no, I very rarely have to...  Yeah, but I got to go.  Go ahead.  No, I just realized I got to go.  You don't have to go.  I don't mean to end the show, I just have to...  Oh, geez, Louise.  You don't have to end the show.  I'm worried about traffic.  I'm pressed.  Hey, Joe, why didn't these guys...  I was watching this video, right? 
[03:03:00]  And they go on for a little while there, and they're shooting into the tree line.  Bye, Jimmy.  Have a good weekend, man.  All right, I'll talk to you.  Yeah.  Give me a text.  Why wouldn't they...  I mean, there are resources there.  Why not just call in a fucking gunship or something to wipe out that tree line?  Well, getting called for fires is really hard, because after we've bombed, we've hit, like,  innocents and stuff like that, you have to get permissions for that.  Oh.  I hate rules.  Yeah, so, like, where we were in Marjo, we had air support, like, all the time, but 
[03:03:30]  you can't get a fire support mission, usually, unless you have, like, your troops in contact,  meaning that you cannot maneuver.  Like, you're completely suppressed.  Oh, so you're totally fucked, and then...  Oh, okay, so they want you to get the job done yourself.  Yeah, basically, unless you go out with females, and then they bring God and everybody along  to make sure that they're protected.  Are you shitting me?  Hey, if some chicks are with you, they'll give you more resources?  Oh, my God, you've got air, you've got drones watching you. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, shit.  Wow.  They'll be all around.  Boy, they love the vagina, because they got the heat-seeking moisture missile.  Get it?  The heat-seeking moisture missile.  I used to say that.  Who didn't?  Okay, good.  Remember that one?  Oh, good, because I...  I think you're making fun of everyone that used to say that, and I certainly was one of  those douches.  I'm an idiot.  Oh, boy.  You know, they don't want the girls getting hit with that.  That's for sure.  Wow, I never knew that.  That's some insight right there.  I like this Joe guy.  Yeah, Joe's a good egg. 
[03:04:30]  All right, man.  Well, hoorah.  Have a good weekend.  Hey, I appreciate it, boys.  Thanks for the call, man.  Take care.  Fucking best radio show ever.  We'll see you guys later.  Of course it is.  Thank you, sir.  All right, thanks.  There he goes.  Yeah, I finally like a caller.  Very funny, motherfuckers.  Happy Father's Day to everybody.  Oh, Opie.  Happy Father's Day.  Look at that.  Thank you.  It's Father's Day.  That's from Creepshow, I think.  Oh.  Bedelia, where's my cake, you bitch? 
[03:05:00]  It's like an extra holiday.  Love that one.  Father's Day is kind of like in between Christmas and your birthday.  Yeah.  It's kind of neat.  It's like a little holiday.  Yeah, you know what?  It means nothing to me.  I know.  That's so weird.  And then you guys, they're like Travis here and stuff, and you.  Actually, it's like a birthday light.  Oh, a birthday light.  Yeah.  Because it's shared with a lot of other guys out there.  But it has that same feeling.  You get a couple little things.  It's Father's Day. 
[03:05:30]  Even though I said I didn't want anything this Father's Day.  Yeah?  Why?  Did you?  Are you that guy?  I don't want anything.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not being that.  But do you get something that way?  I'm not being that character right now.  No, we're going to go to one of those all-you-can-eat meat places.  Oh, like they carve the meat off there?  I think we're going Brazilian.  Brazilian, yeah.  I think there's different types now, though, right?  Is there?  We're dizzy.  What?  No, I'm going to the Philly area.  Oops.  Oh. 
[03:06:00]  Philly area.  Oh, boy.  Now there's going to be a whole situation outside the restaurant.  Oh, yeah.  Fight off people going in and out.  Paparazzi.  Paparazzi, all that shit.  Yeah, because people care about us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As we sit here in our little studio, not allowed to go out or do anything.  I had to tell my dad he was not going to have a visit for me for Father's Day.  Why?  Why is that?  There's a wrestling pay-per-view in Jersey.  Oh.  WWE's in town.  No way out, baby.  He's not going to be around forever.  That's crazy.  You know how I would love to see my father this fucking Father's Day? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, but at the same time.  And I'm not going to...  Take him for granted.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Sam.  I did the grave site for one Father's Day.  Never again.  Why would you do that?  With the...  I mean, the crowds.  Oh, and they're all depressed.  And the rubbernecking and the...  It takes forever just to get into the cemetery.  Fuck that.  People are just dying to get into the cemetery.  Oh, man.  Right.  You're about to play in the crash at the cemetery.  Yeah.  I'll make it easy for everybody.  You think they had to pull the body out?  Why wouldn't you just leave the body there? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Take a hole, throw it in.  Right.  So that's the end game anyway.  Don't worry about it.  No, there's always a traffic jam around the cemeteries for Father's Day and Mother's  Day.  Yeah.  There are people going.  I don't know why.  That whole thing.  I learned from my dad.  He doesn't...  He's ghoulish.  He didn't do that shit.  No, it's...  They plant them and then you fucking, you know...  You know where they are.  They're not leaving.  Where's your dad?  Not like he could talk.  In California somewhere.  But in a thing?  Yeah, he's in a thing. 
[03:07:30]  In a cemetery thing?  I guess so.  I've never been there.  I don't know.  Did he get a good thing?  Like a bench or something?  A bench?  Yeah, some of the people get benches so he could sit down at least.  Probably not.  I wouldn't imagine there's a bench.  He didn't get the bench overlooking a nice valley or something?  No.  He didn't get that?  I think there's a funnel there.  We could just turn over a bottle.  Beer bottle.  Did he get the low ground?  Did he get the low ground?  Yeah.  Meaning, you know, there's a possibility he might float away someday.  Yeah, maybe. 
[03:08:00]  Some flooded areas.  Yes.  Calverton.  This guy's asking, that place is always packed on holidays.  Every cemetery is packed on holidays.  Yeah.  Every single one.  That's what they do.  And then they jack up their flowers nearby, all that shit.  Yeah.  People making fucking money off our dead relatives.  Yeah.  The thing is, though, you don't see a John Cena Big Show Steel Cage match every day either.  Is that how you presented it to your father?  You just kind of measure, weigh your options, and figure out, you know. 
[03:08:30]  He was there for you for your wedding a mere couple weeks ago, and now Father's Day, you're  blowing him off for a pay-per-view.  Exactly.  I mean, we literally just saw each other a couple weeks ago for the wedding.  Why don't you just watch it with him?  A nice Father's Day moment.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  You don't want to go to that.  Why?  He doesn't share your enthusiasm of wrestling?  He took me to enough shows when I was a kid.  He doesn't want to keep going to these shows.  Maybe he wants to rekindle that bond that you guys had as a kid.  I don't think he does.  You never know.  What is it?  No Way Out?  That's right. 
[03:09:00]  That's right.  I guess we'll talk about that on the 10 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  We'll listen.  Dolph Ziggler versus Sheamus?  Come on.  Sheamus.  Nice.  What?  I have no idea.  Sounds great.  I know.  World title.  Well, I'd love to hang out and talk about all this.  Oh, cool.  Thanks.  We got a weekend to start.  Oh, right.  I'm unplugging.  All right, everyone.  But the trick is.  What are you doing?  That.  Look, look.  I know what his bid is, and I'm going to explain to you idiots.  Oh, I know. 
[03:09:30]  The show officially ends at 9.52 to get everything in before 10 o'clock.  That's how it always works.  That's terrestrial rules.  No, no.  We play by satellite rules.  No, we don't.  Which, there are no rules.  Exactly.  There are no rules.  Except all the ones that.  That was the selling point when we came here.  Three to seven.  No rules, except these.  Read them.  Except all these rules.  Adhere to them or be fired.  We are well known for doing a three to seven afternoon drive show.  Yeah.  That was the peak of this program that we've been trying to get to ever since, and it's  just not happening. 
[03:10:00]  You're almost there.  But three o'clock.  We didn't talk till 3.20 was our first break.  And then we left at 6.52.  Do you want to see me count to 100?  See you at Monday.  I don't think you can do it.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  I don't think you can do it. 
[03:10:30]  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it.  I don't think you can do it. </pre>
