<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between current events, personal anecdotes, and listener calls.  It began with the hosts discussing the end of winter, daylight savings time, and Neil deGrasse Tyson's dramatic exits in a Cosmos episode.  Anthony recounted a disappointing Huntington town parade experience and problems with his brother's restaurant parking.  They then discussed Jim Brewer's stand-up career and its surprising lack of Hollywood success.  Guest Jimmy Newton shared a story about awkward radio appearances in California during Spring Training, prompting a discussion about the evolution of their own comedic style and their experiences with other comedians.

The conversation abruptly shifted to the missing Malaysian Airlines plane, sparking speculation about possible causes, including mechanical failure and terrorism.  This segued into a discussion of Mayor de Blasio, his feuds with Liam Neeson and Al Roker, and Anthony's past Twitter conflict with Al Roker, including a recollection of a past phone call with Roker on the Ron and Fez show.  The hosts also touched upon the Imus firing and the controversy surrounding his use of the phrase "nappy-headed hoe."  The show then veered into a discussion of Central Park horse-drawn carriages, before Anthony shared an embarrassing story about a limo ride to see "Cats," which triggered reminiscences about other limo experiences, including one involving a business associate with questionable accounting practices. The segment concluded with a brief mention of a future guest and comments on U2 and Louis C.K.

The next segment opened with a discussion of a rejection letter sent to U2 (then known as Paul Hewson) by RSO Records, highlighting the irony of their later successes compared to their initial dismissal. The hosts discussed RSO's roster, including the Bee Gees and Eric Clapton, and their involvement in films like *Saturday Night Fever*, before focusing on the disastrous *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* movie.  This transitioned into a discussion of a police interrogation video of Pete Townshend of The Who, regarding child pornography allegations.  Townshend's explanation—that his actions were for research purposes related to his autobiography and addressing his childhood sexual abuse—was played and dissected, with the hosts expressing skepticism.

Listener calls followed, covering childhood sexual abuse and its effects on sexuality, a caller claiming to have seen Princess Diana crying in a car, and a discussion of Justin Bieber's uncooperative deposition. One caller attempted (unsuccessfully) to create a comedic persona based on disliking Joe Rogan.  The hosts then awaited the promised Princess Diana video from an earlier caller.

Another segment returned to the missing Malaysian Airlines plane, with continued speculation about the cause, including mechanical issues, terrorism, and even alien abduction.  A caller shared a humorous story about a disastrous limo ride to Medieval Times, and a lengthy segment featured "Lady Di," a frequent caller known for erratic behavior, discussing her purported video crying in front of a Target.  This led to a humorous exchange where they attempted to get her to list things that made her cry, along with discussions of her alcohol consumption, job search, and hygiene.  The conversation returned to the plane's disappearance, with a caller noting the lack of radio calls from the pilots and a discussion of an *Air Disasters* segment about a plane losing a cargo door.  The hosts also briefly commented on Sarah Palin's CPAC appearance and a call with Steve from Brooklyn led to a discussion of Sarah Palin versus Joe Biden and the state of American politics, ending with further speculation about the missing plane.

The final segment focused on a highly exaggerated and vulgar political attack ad for Paul R. Nelson, contrasting him with his opponent, Ron Kind, featuring claims about Ron Kind’s alleged support for gay marriage, misuse of taxpayer funds on sexually explicit research, and other outlandish accusations. The hosts played a remixed version of the campaign jingle repeatedly. They also noted Ron Kind's surprising victory despite the accusations. The segment concluded with listener calls about a middle school teacher's accidental showing of a sex tape to her class, listeners' childhood experiences with discovering their parents' sexual items, the ease of accessing pornography for today's youth, discussions about the attractiveness of various women, and crude descriptions of sexual acts, ending with the hosts repeatedly saying "I have a bad case of diarrhea."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Hey, good morning everyone!  Hi!  It's radio time!  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  You have a good weekend.  Oh yeah.  My, the weekend's always kind of good because  you can sleep late.  Well, the weather changed, so  people are out and about.  I'm going to burn my winter coat,  my winter hat, my Long Johns, 
[00:00:30]  my, uh, my Merrells.  Yeah.  In one big pile.  Yeah.  Even though I could get another season  out of all this stuff,  I never want to wear...  I don't want to wear this coat ever again.  Yeah.  It's been the longest fucking winter.  It really has, and I guess Thursday  we're going to get fucked again with some, uh,  cold, late-minute cold temperatures.  Late-minute crap, though.  We'll be alright.  We're on the way out, finally.  I've had it.  Did, uh, did everyone spring ahead? 
[00:01:00]  Did you spring ahead?  I was, uh, noticing, I never,  I don't have to touch anything anymore.  You don't have to set your clocks ahead anymore.  I don't know why they tell people that.  My stove's a little old,  but now that matches up.  Is that it?  Yeah, because I never changed it the other time.  Oh, you didn't change it last time.  So now it finally matches up.  So you have six good months a year  and six bad months a year with your stove clock.  Right.  I just, I just,  now it all matches up, but you're right.  But everything just changes itself.  I woke up yesterday morning looking at my stuff going,  wait a minute. 
[00:01:30]  Wait, do I have to,  do I have to change this or did it change on its own?  I was trying to figure it out.  Because years ago,  you just had to change everything.  The clock,  you take it off the wall in your kitchen.  Right.  Your kitchen clock and turn the dial.  This is the way it should be.  Right.  So stop with the fallback crap.  Yeah.  We're not farmers anymore.  Even farmers aren't farmers anymore.  No.  Leave it like this.  They got sod on their farms.  That's not farming.  Leave it like this.  I'm talking about the Long Island farmers.  I don't know about the rest of the farmers out there, 
[00:02:00]  but that was the initial reason for doing this.  So you could get up early.  Yeah.  Something about that.  I don't even know what it is.  Yeah.  It's dumb.  It's dumb to just knock everyone into darkness in the fall like that.  Especially when you're just hanging on for that last bit of light.  It's already taking care of it on its own by getting shorter and shorter days.  And then we decide as humans,  no,  we've got to make it even worse.  Yeah.  It's the dumbest thing.  Thanks.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  I was kind of getting used to driving in. 
[00:02:30]  I started noticing.  Just a peak.  It's getting a little light.  This is a little taste.  Now it's just dark again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Love you.  Love you.  Miss you,  son.  Come back and see you soon.  I do like the later,  uh,  lighter,  later though.  Yeah.  Of course.  Who doesn't?  That's a fun thing.  So why would we just,  you know,  throw that away?  Just leave it alone.  It's darker longer now,  right?  In the morning.  Yeah.  That's what I prefer.  I like it like that.  I like coming in in pitch black.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I like it later,  like, 
[00:03:00]  you know,  seven,  eight o'clock.  Well,  now it's about what?  Seven o'clock.  Yeah.  We're pushing seven o'clock before,  uh,  the sun goes down,  I guess.  Something like that.  I don't know.  You do get a little extra after the sun goes down anyway.  Yeah.  What's that about?  Oh.  The sun's down.  Shouldn't we just go into darkness right away?  I know there's a real answer and I kind of know the answer.  So don't call.  So don't call.  It's kind of a joke.  What is the answer?  Cosmos.  Huh?  What is the answer?  I don't know.  It's not really down yet.  It's just our perspective.  Right? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's,  you know,  if you look at,  I go to you,  right?  If you go a little higher,  help me before I sound stupid.  Yeah.  Horizons.  Did you watch Cosmos last night?  Uh,  you know,  it's a premiere,  right?  Did you watch?  No,  I didn't.  Oh,  it's getting rave reviews,  man.  People really dig it.  I saw it.  It was great.  And they are noticing the dramatic walk out of frame.  Oh,  really?  They noticed that one?  Neil Tyson does.  Yeah.  I almost tweeted a picture that I watched the disc on the road and I almost  tweeted a picture.  There's one where he's behind a wall in like Italy or something. 
[00:04:00]  And then he walks off dramatically.  Dramatically.  I might have to do a montage of the walk-offs.  Very dramatically.  Yeah.  He's good with the dramatic walk-off.  He is.  I,  uh,  I saw a parade yesterday.  Oh,  you did?  Even though I was bitching about it.  You went to a Huntington,  I assume,  and,  uh,  watched.  Then I'm standing there going,  why am I doing this?  I don't like this.  Terrible.  And even my son,  who's only,  he's not even four,  looks at me,  he goes,  I'm bored. 
[00:04:30]  Of course.  I'm like,  all right,  let's go get ice cream,  even though it's 40 degrees.  It's the shittiest fucking parade.  It broke down to the whole town was marching.  Yeah,  yeah.  So then,  you know,  I,  I needed to get across the street.  Yeah,  there,  I took a picture of him.  There it is.  Well,  that was just a cheap,  uh,  way to get a plug for FH Riley,  to be honest with you.  Yeah,  there's a picture on my Instagram,  Mopey Radio,  of FH Riley's,  with a whole bunch of people in front,  waiting for the parade to start.  Yeah.  So,  a little festive.  How long did he take before he got bored?  Mm,  20 minutes tops.  He heard a few sirens.  That was cool. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  He,  no offense to the bagpipers,  but he thought you guys were ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.  The bagpipes.  Oh,  no.  And then I,  I got him into the bit.  We just started going,  why are these cars in the parade?  And then he kept turning to me and repeating,  like,  what,  another car?  Why is it in the parade?  Another car with people waving?  Just car dealerships,  nobodies.  That's a bad parade.  Like,  I don't know,  women that, 
[00:05:30]  a little chubby to be there.  Kind of,  yeah,  yeah.  Whatever they are for the parade,  I don't know.  What is this?  Grand Marshal,  or the,  I don't know.  Or the ones that just pop up on the back of the convertibles.  Yeah,  all that crap.  So they can wave.  Yeah.  Then there's a party DJ on the back of a flatbed,  just cranking tunes.  Hard driver hits?  Yeah,  with a hard,  actually,  yeah.  It could have been Dennis.  Denny.  But Denny is lazy.  He doesn't go for the big gigs.  And then a whole bunch of people just dancing. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like,  who are those people?  Why are they in the parade?  Yeah.  So then he got bored,  and I wanted to get across the street back to the F.H. Riley side,  but you can't just do that.  So I just,  I just hopped the barrier with my son,  and I just walked the parade for a while.  Oh,  shit.  Until I saw the ice cream place,  and I cut over to the right,  and no one knew the difference.  You were in the parade.  I just blended in.  Was he excited to be in the parade?  No,  he didn't give a crap.  He just wanted ice cream.  But you can't walk the sidewalk,  so I'm like,  hey,  maybe that's what everyone else is doing. 
[00:06:30]  That's probably what it is.  They're just trying to get somewhere else,  not in the parade.  And then it turns out,  I was like,  oh,  why are these nobodies in the parade?  It was good to be in Huntington,  though.  I miss Huntington.  You can't get around during that parade.  No.  It's really hard to get around.  Yeah.  No parking anywhere.  You've got to park 18,000 miles away.  Well,  we want to get that second floor going,  but the town's being a real pain in the ass  because there's no parking left in Huntington,  so they're really not allowing expansions. 
[00:07:00]  So my brother's kind of giving up on expanding upwards,  unfortunately.  That sounds great.  Nice progress.  But when you want to do that,  yeah.  Especially because my brother's been there  eight,  nine years now.  He's a solid business owner,  so when you want to make the business owners  that are really doing very well,  you want to help them out?  You think?  Because there's restaurants closing down  every other day in Huntington.  Yeah.  He's been able to survive,  thanks to this show,  to be honest with you,  at first,  thanks to this show.  Those lean years when he was still  working on his reputation, 
[00:07:30]  we were able to help the numbers,  but now he doesn't need us at all.  Jesus,  that place is just kicking.  But they don't have parking.  Yeah,  parking in there is horrendous.  So why don't they just figure out  parking?  Because the town is thriving.  But the town is thriving.  That's a good problem  if people can't find parking.  Yeah.  I went and saw Jim Brewer  the night before at Huntington as well.  Brewer.  I was going back and forth  from the city.  Yeah.  Oh,  you did that drive  a couple of times?  Twice.  Went out to see Brewer  Saturday night 
[00:08:00]  at the Paramount.  Those people  are doing a great job  with that theater.  I just told Jimmy,  he's got to play this place.  It's amazing.  Yeah,  it's gorgeous.  They put a lot of money  in refurbishing this thing.  It's really,  really nice inside.  Really nice.  And they're doing  like 170 shows a year,  Jim was telling me.  One of the guys  that owns it.  Yeah.  And Brewer was there  and he's just,  he's just,  Brewer.  He's ridiculous  how good he is.  Yeah.  He's awesome.  He did six bits  in an hour and 15 minutes. 
[00:08:30]  He's a storyteller.  Yeah.  But they're just amazing.  Yeah.  We're all talking around me.  I was with a whole bunch of people  and I don't understand  why someone like Jim Brewer  is not doing a million movies  in Hollywood.  Yeah.  Because he's so animated  and can do characters.  I don't get it.  I guess.  Because you know  all the people  that get those breaks  and then Brewer  is way funnier.  I don't know why either  because he can act.  I mean,  you know,  again,  he did really,  he was funny on SNL.  He's like,  prove it he can hold  that type of a gig. 
[00:09:00]  I don't understand it  at this point.  He does so many  different characters.  I mean,  it's so animated.  He could tell a good story  as characters  that he has.  Characters.  Voice over,  he'd be great for.  He could do voice over stuff.  Animations,  whatever.  He gets a little bit  here and there  but I don't get that one.  I don't understand.  Hollywood just sucks.  Yeah.  They are just fucking,  they're just picking  the wrong people  in the end,  I think.  Is he pursuing that?  I really believe that.  He might even be pursuing that.  Oh, sure,  yes,  for years.  Sure. 
[00:09:30]  But he was great.  He was great.  How was California,  Jimmy?  Really good,  man.  I was worried about  ticket sales going out there  and it picked up a lot.  I had one regular radio show  out there  because the other one,  they had to cancel  because they had spring training stuff.  You had to go to spring training.  Oh my gosh.  Who would do that?  But it was,  it was just awful.  I mean,  baseball is exciting  around what,  August?  Yeah,  exactly.  Not March.  There's no need  for spring training.  No one cares  about spring training. 
[00:10:00]  Well,  the players,  it's good for them  but not for everybody else.  No one cares.  What are you talking about?  They haven't even played  one game out of 162 yet.  Those baseball geeks  that bring the fucking  stat sheets  to the fucking game,  those are the people.  Pitchers and catchers.  Oh,  shut up.  I got a  Moe and queebs.  You know what?  I got a brother-in-law.  Yeah,  he's a dweeb.  Really?  One of those?  He lives in Florida  and can't get enough  of spring training.  Ugh.  Why?  I don't know. 
[00:10:30]  It's the worst.  The Grapefruit League.  My older sister's husband  is all in with this.  Yuck.  Wow,  that's terrible.  I think it is.  Holy shit.  I think it is.  Really?  Although you get to see  your team in an intimate  setting, I guess.  Yeah.  Because they play  in those stadiums  that don't hold  a lot of people down there.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like going  to a regular baseball game.  Why would I go  to a spring training game?  Spring training.  So they were at 
[00:11:00]  spring training  so they had to cancel  your interview?  Yeah,  I did do one  regular radio show  and I forget the guy's name.  He was a nice guy.  It was like an alt rock station.  He was good.  Yeah.  But I get in there  and this is like  what regular radio is.  Like you get in there  and I'm...  Oh,  I don't remember.  I'm used to channels  at this point.  What station?  I honestly don't know.  You don't know  what station you walked  into a mere couple days ago?  No idea.  Holy crap.  I do so many  that when you're on the road  you...  I'll remember the guy.  Think about it.  But a lot of times  they just introduce you  and you walk right in.  Oh,  that's gotta be  insulting to that station. 
[00:11:30]  But nah,  they don't...  They didn't know me either.  Like I walk in there,  right,  and I walk in there  and there's two sales...  They didn't know you.  No idea.  Two sales guys  are standing there  and they say to the club guy  they go,  Oh yeah,  he looks familiar to me.  They're like,  we...  I didn't recognize you  from your bio  but now I see  I recognize you.  And then the woman  who was working there,  I guess she was  at the head of sales,  goes,  Oh yeah,  and she goes,  this is Jim Newton.  Oh no.  Jim Newton.  So they walk me back in.  A little reality check, huh?  Oh, absolutely, dude. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  And they walk me  into the station  and before I go on air,  we're talking  and the DJ's a good dude.  He's playing music  and trying to make a living  and they're like,  he's like,  do you want me  to lead you anywhere?  And the woman  in the head of sales  is going,  he's like,  what bits do you want to do?  I'm like,  well,  I'm not going to really  do any bits.  Right.  And she's like,  well,  you have to do some bits.  The woman jumps in  and she goes,  you have to do some bits.  And I'm like,  well,  I don't do that on the air.  I mean,  conversationally,  we can talk.  Wait,  who was this woman?  She was the head of sales,  I think.  Oh,  what?  Why are you seeing there? 
[00:12:30]  Well,  she was telling more him.  Oh,  that's funny.  You've got to do bits.  It was almost like  watching parents  scold their son  in front of you  and then he has to go,  well,  yeah,  like the last couple,  like then he has to explain  why the last couple  of comics that were in  didn't do many bits.  They just talked a little bit  but not,  they weren't great performances.  So,  we actually had a really good time  because I just spoke  but I mean,  we just talked about whatever.  You didn't do bits?  It drove,  but I'm like,  I'm thinking to myself,  this is why radio  falls into the toilet  because,  people behind the scenes 
[00:13:00]  are telling the on-air guys,  this is how you'll be funny  and this guy is just  trying to do an entertaining show.  That's why we blew off comics  for so many years  because they would come in,  our Boston years mostly  and they would do bits  and I'm like,  oh,  if you're a comedian,  I would assume you  have a funny bone,  can't you just hang  and maybe get a few funny lines in?  That's all we're looking for.  Just talk.  Right.  Just hang out  and then when we came to New York,  you know,  that changed,  especially with Jimmy  coming on our show.  Jimmy Newton?  Jimmy Newton.  Yeah,  Jimmy Newton brought the comics 
[00:13:30]  that could just be funny.  How many of those  are going to show up  on Twitter?  Oh,  I hope a lot of them.  A bunch of Jimmy Newtons.  I'm related to fig and juice.  Juice.  Oh,  that's got to be weird though.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Especially if they don't  really know you  and just walk in.  I never know if they do or not.  I heard the guys  that wanted to have me on  were actually really good.  They do like a half hour  to Classic Rock Station  and that would have been  more of a people  that liked me. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  But it was just one of those  timing things.  I didn't care.  I enjoyed him more  than I thought I would.  And the fans came out?  Yeah,  they were really good.  Nice.  Thursday was about half  and then Friday and Saturday  were mobbed.  I was very shocked.  Very cool.  Yeah.  It was a bigger club  than I thought too.  Better numbers  than the last time  you were at that place?  It's been seven years  so I don't remember.  Oh,  Jesus,  really?  Seven years.  Wow.  I know that I was  really surprised  how full it was.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  So it was nice.  Ooh.  And you didn't do anything?  Just chilled out?  I didn't do anything.  I chilled out, 
[00:14:30]  watched some TV.  That's about it.  I sat in front of the TV.  Played a little Xbox.  Yeah.  Other than that though,  man,  nothing.  Just a wasted weekend.  I love those though.  Man,  it's nothing better  than just kicking back  on the couch.  No.  No?  No.  Oh,  well,  you got a couple of  little tater tots  running around.  I cannot be in my apartment  anymore.  No?  I have a nice apartment,  yeah,  but who cares?  I want to be outside. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah?  Enough already.  Oh,  no.  Enough already.  In L.A.,  just driving around,  opening the,  I'm like,  just turn the air,  I just want the windows off.  Yeah.  Having the windows,  open and fresh air on you  is really delightful.  Yeah.  We missed that.  Forgot how nice air is.  Yeah.  Oh,  no.  Yeah,  it was kind of nice  opening the doors  and windows and stuff  the other day.  Nice and warm.  Mm.  Yeah.  That plane crash,  that doesn't look good,  huh?  Oh, 
[00:15:30]  no.  I think it looks like a little  shenanigans going on there.  Hijinks and shenanigans  going on.  A little terrorism,  perhaps?  Terrorism.  It just seems like they  kind of dropped the ball  on that one.  They have a couple of  passengers with stolen  passports.  Yeah.  And then the plane  just kind of disappears.  Right.  There was a move  to turn back  or something,  right?  Yeah,  they're still looking  into all that shit.  I don't know,  maybe a bomb.  Well,  yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe they blowed it up.  I think a bomb went off. 
[00:16:00]  I think something went off  and they lost cabin pressure  and they tried to turn  and then maybe either  broke apart.  The whole thing came apart,  yeah.  They said you only have  a few seconds,  if you lose cabin pressure  at like 35,000,  40,000 feet,  you have,  what do they call it?  Useful consciousness  or something  where you have a few seconds  to actually do something  with the aircraft.  Otherwise,  you just,  like paying stewards  plane when they all  just kind of blacked out.  Like,  that's maybe what happens  at that height.  Yeah,  yeah.  the pilots usually,  yeah,  they train for that shit.  They put on their own  oxygen masks  and hopefully fly the plane.  But if it comes apart, 
[00:16:30]  there's nothing  you can really do about that.  Yeah.  And they said  they just disappeared  from the radar.  So that pretty much  says catastrophic  structural failure.  Yeah.  I don't even think  they've found any debris  or anything.  What,  a little oil slick  or whatever they're saying?  And they think a door.  They think they saw  something that looked  like a fuselage door,  they said.  A fuselage door.  I think they were saying  that part of the ocean  is not that deep  so they could,  really,  they feel like  eventually they'll be able  to find some shit. 
[00:17:00]  You gotta find where  it went first.  That's what I heard,  I don't know.  But that just seems  repeating stuff I heard.  What am I doing?  That's what we do.  Maybe I should have  researched it myself.  Like you watch the news.  I heard that somewhere  and just decided,  oh,  now I'm an expert.  I'll reiterate.  Right.  Yeah.  I know it's a 770  and I know those are very,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  7,  and those are  pretty safe aircraft.  I know that.  Yeah,  I've always known them.  I've always known them.  They're pretty nice. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Yeah.  They're big.  Nice big twin.  They always scare me though  because there's only two engines.  Usually you have a third engine.  These are twin engine planes  and 767s are the same thing  but just a little smaller.  A lot of them are  two engines these days.  The Airbuses?  Yeah,  Airbuses,  you'll get four.  Nice.  Yeah,  but for the most part  the Boeings,  we're all like  two engines now.  De Blasio's going to be  on MSNBC.  Can we roll tape on that?  What is he talking about?  The horse-drawn carriages? 
[00:18:00]  Well,  him and Liam Neeson  are going at it.  Oh,  look out.  Liam Neeson.  Well,  look out.  We'll get you.  I don't like this guy  but if you're the mayor,  ignore what Liam Neeson  has to say.  How about that?  Or ignore what  Al Roker has to say.  Yeah.  What's wrong with this guy?  Well,  you're the mayor.  You don't have to listen  to what Al Roker has to say.  Liam Neeson.  What was the Al Roker thing?  Al Roker couldn't believe  that he didn't close  the schools or something?  Yeah.  During one of the snowstorms?  Yeah.  So he has a beef 
[00:18:30]  with Al Roker.  Al Roker!  Imagine you're the mayor  and you've got to entertain  some bullshit  with Al Roker.  Holy Jesus.  Then he went on  the Today Show  to make sure it was all good.  Yeah.  He went to Al Roker's house.  Right.  To be like,  we're cool, right Al?  Yeah.  You had Al on,  didn't you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Was he good?  He was all right.  He was good.  Where's he at with us?  No.  I had a Twitter beef  with him a few years back  because I was so pissed off  that his fear-mongering  kicked everyone out  of the Outer Banks  while I was down there.  And it turned out  that that year 
[00:19:00]  there was a bust  and we all could have stayed.  But Al Roker was on that beach  making sure everyone left  because it was good for ratings.  So we went back and forth  for a little bit there.  I was pissed.  And Jim's had a history  with him as well.  Yeah, I don't think  he cares for me too much.  I bashed him in my book.  All right.  And then on the Ron and Fez show  that one day,  that was a weird thing though.  What do you mean  on the Ron and Fez show one day?  It was a couple years ago.  I mean, five years ago now.  When we first started working here.  We came to Sirius.  Right.  I think it was four years 
[00:19:30]  right around now.  Yeah, it was around there.  And they had Al in studio.  And I think one of them  called me or something  where they had mentioned  yeah, we're going to have  Al Roker in  if you want to call in.  So I'm like, okay.  And then I got a call  and I want to say  it was Pepper Hicks  on the phone.  And he goes,  all right, we got Al Roker in now.  And I'm like, okay.  So they put me through.  So I'm thinking  that they had been  discussing something.  Ah, okay.  So they go, okay, Jim,  we got Al.  So they're like, all right.  It was almost like  I just called in randomly, 
[00:20:00]  which I didn't.  And I didn't yell  and scream at him.  I just asked him about the,  I guess I'm blocking  that I was getting fired.  He's like, I had nothing to,  I forget what he said.  Cop out.  Yeah, he didn't want to,  he didn't really want to.  He had nothing to do with what?  But he felt like  he was sabotaged  and that annoyed me  because I didn't sabotage the guy.  I didn't know what it was.  I didn't call him  to sabotage his appearance  and call me.  Right.  But yeah, I don't think  he cares for me at all.  I mean, yeah,  he's definitely aware  of you guys,  but he's of the opinion  that everybody's entitled  to have their own opinion.  There you go.  Did you ask him about us? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, well, I did  last time I talked to him.  What did he say that time?  Multiple interviews  with the rich and famous.  My pal Al.  Yeah, Al Roker  should be one time  and done.  Exactly.  What is he going to give you  the second time around?  The second time.  You should only grill that guy.  He's a cancer for our business.  He's not good.  No.  No.  The second time was when,  you know,  he came back  and all his news stories  about him sharting  in the White House  and sleeping in.  Did you have tea  with the guy?  No, I just talked to him.  Yeah.  What did you do? 
[00:21:00]  Tell me you agreed  with the Imus firing  and you guys bonded?  Traitor?  Traitor.  Being a nappy-headed boy yourself.  Yes.  That's right.  Yes, that's offensive to you.  You should be very offended.  By Mr. Imus?  Yes.  Mr. Imus.  You're a bit nappy.  You nappy-headed hoe.  That's what got him...  Jesus.  Can you believe it?  This world's stupid.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Outrage over nappy-headed hoe.  It was ridiculous then.  It's still ridiculous.  And now it just seems  even more ridiculous. 
[00:21:30]  Especially because  it's still even more  the more...  Now listening back to it,  it really was  just a silly old man.  Just a silly old man  with a throwaway line.  I don't know.  It was funny.  Well, I agree with the firing.  It was just being funny that day.  Good for you, Jim.  I didn't care for that  and I think that this type of language  has to be done responsibly  and I'm glad we're banning  e-cigarettes too.  That's important.  He was a giant.  Huh?  He was a giant man.  De Blasio.  Yeah, he's going to  go down as one of our worst mayors.  Yeah.  He, uh... 
[00:22:00]  There's something  not right about him.  I'm telling you.  You want the horse-drawn carriages?  It's going to take a little while  but there's something  not right about this guy.  Why doesn't he come down  to the stable?  The carriages have been taken.  Soy sauce.  That's all I think of  when I see him now  is his soy sauce.  He just wants him  to come down to the stables  and check it out.  Come down to the stables.  I guess the horses  are well taken care of  but it doesn't help 
[00:22:30]  when they just, you know,  line up on Central Park West  waiting for that next ride  and the cabs and everyone beeping  and flying by them.  That's got to be hell on your nerves.  Standing in the heat.  On your little horse nerves.  Do that little thing where they pick up their foot  and they're like, slam it down.  They're impatient.  They probably just want to fucking gallop somewhere.  Give me some running room, motherfucker.  That's right.  I bet they don't get many chances to run.  None.  Horses got to run. 
[00:23:00]  Run!  Poor things.  Yeah, I hate those things.  I can't wait until they just fucking fuck him in his dump.  I have a lot of friends who do that.  Do you?  Get them acting jobs then, hot shit.  I should put them in the movies.  Or at least suggest that the horses stay in Central Park.  In the park.  They won't get as many, you know, tourists.  Tourists want everything nice and easy for them right there.  They want to be like a movie where they leave the plaza  and they hop down the horse and buggy. 
[00:23:30]  I've never done the horse and buggy.  I'm trying to think if I ever did that.  I don't think I have either.  I've lived in New York, what, about 11 years now?  Something like that.  12 now, maybe?  Jesus.  I don't know.  Yeah, it costs a fortune, and I think by the time I was able to afford it,  it just seemed so stupid to do.  Right.  Like, that is some hacky shit I would have done, like, years ago  and thought it was the greatest.  Really?  Yeah, like when me and the dumb wife went to fucking go see Cats on Broadway, 
[00:24:00]  and I got a limo and went to the Russian tea room because I thought it was like a city,  a night out in the big city like I'm a mover, shaker, and a player.  Oh, God.  Wearing my fucking suit that I bought at Sid's Pants at the mall.  Oh, that white trash piece of Long Island shit.  And that's now.  Yes.  And you're better than you used to be.  You just described thousands of people's weekends. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, of course.  It's terrible.  You know how many people do exactly that every weekend?  Oh, God.  Isn't this great?  Look, we're out in the big city with a limousine.  Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee.  Do people understand that limos have become hack?  It's so bad.  Just get an SUV and fucking do it that way.  The stretch limo with the moonroof and shit is so hacky.  We've been in a bunch of those over the years.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  I don't mind taking one to the Borgata because then I could sleep.  I could stretch out.  But to go to an event and pull up in a limo is...  Ronnie's last is ass.  I was like, they got us the prom limo.  Right.  As a nobody, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you pop up, pop out.  Who's that?  And you pop out of a limo and you see the disappointment on everyone's faces.  Everyone's face.  Because they thought they were going to see Brad Pitt or something coming out of a limo.  I remember getting out of the limo when we went to go see, you know, cats. 
[00:25:30]  Me and the wife.  And I remember standing by the door of the limo with it open a little longer than I should  so people could see.  Right.  Ew.  Like, look, look.  Look what I got.  I was hoping people would look and be like, ooh, who's that?  Come on.  Who's that?  It's Anthony Cumia from Apollo Air Conditioning.  Who's that big shot?  He is.  I'm a big shot.  How much did the limo cost you?  Oh, who the hell knows?  You don't remember?  It was probably, you know, a couple of hundy. 
[00:26:00]  A couple of hundy and that.  And I probably fucking jacked the guy on the tip.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do is write.  I remember.  Hold on.  Oh, there you go.  That's right.  So you were born here, but your family moved up.  Move up there when I was just five years old.  Yeah.  As I said, 1967, impossible dream.  So you're there?  1975, Carlton Fisk.  I lived through all that.  Killing me.  My lord.  Sorry, Willie.  Yankee fan.  You know I'm the only Yankee fan at this table in New York City.  Always.  As the middle of New York City.  Oh, boy. 
[00:26:30]  Listen, I'm just rambling.  So we've got a lot to talk about.  How are your kids doing?  They are wonderful.  Good.  How's the job?  It's kind of boring, isn't it?  Yeah, it's pretty boring.  Nothing going on.  I was expecting a little more excitement.  And by the way, what's with the snowstorm?  Every other.  Hey, one snowstorm after another after another after another.  You're doing a crappy job on that front.  I want it warm.  Okay?  It's coming up.  What the hell are they talking about?  There's a snowstorm for seven weeks.  See, I told people if they elected you, this city was going to hell.  And look what you're doing.  See what happened.  Bolar vortex.  See what happened.  And where's your global warming? 
[00:27:00]  I'm all in support of that.  I'm expecting that global warming damage.  Jeff, what happened?  This is so bad.  Dr. Stocks, it's a little more in the middle of the house.  Let's not get into your problems, Nick.  This would be a new area of research.  Okay.  All right.  So, Mr. Mayor, we've got a lot to cover.  Let's start first, though.  Yeah.  I'd like to cover it.  Because, you know, I'm a uniter, not a divider.  That's right.  Let's start by something that unites, I think, most people around this table in New York.  And that is pre-K.  Yeah.  Who would be against that?  Mika is very excited to participate with you guys and the boards that we came from. 
[00:27:30]  Just see what these idiots talk about.  Oh, it's just awful.  Bring us a clip if it's good.  Yeah.  Missing Plane Mystery.  Yeah.  May have disintegrated in there.  Jeez.  Another American may have been on board.  I tweet about it over the weekend.  We all understand the tragedy of this Malaysian airplane. 
[00:28:00]  Uh-huh.  But they have to do, and there were two infants on board.  Yeah.  And they have to say, like, oh, there were Americans, too, so you could care a little  more about them than these other foreign people.  Yeah.  They follow a pattern.  Plane crash, bad.  Americans on board, even worse.  And now we're hearing a victim could be from our area.  Right.  What?  Even worse.  And then they nail you with the, and there were two infants on board.  Oh.  To me, those are the least tragic, because the infants had no idea what's happening. 
[00:28:30]  They don't know.  They don't understand anything, so they hear a big boom.  They don't understand where the plane's going.  Yeah.  Wah.  Big boom.  Daddy drunk again.  They don't know.  But why do they have to do that?  Why do they have to add that there are infants involved in a tragedy?  All the news loves it.  It's already a tragedy.  We get it.  And in your own mind, you could assume there's going to be all walks of life on that plane.  Yeah.  Guess what?  There were probably a few scumbags that died as well.  Especially if there were terrorists on board. 
[00:29:00]  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  How awful is it?  They just keep showing the grieving families in the air.  Oh, no.  That's not news.  No.  If they were line dancing and having fun waiting, that's newsworthy.  That's something I'd like to see, because that's shocking.  Yeah.  Them crying in the airport is disgusting.  It's terrible.  Yeah, why would they show that?  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Watching someone's grief like that.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why?  They love it.  And they shoved the cameras right in their faces.  So what are you thinking now? 
[00:29:30]  What do you think they're thinking?  That they're dead and I'm sad.  Right.  Back to you.  Oh, man.  That is terrible.  Yeah.  Godspeed.  Where are you?  Where'd you go?  Gwad?  Yeah, they went up to Gwad.  That's it.  Gwad will take care of them now.  Oh, by the way, my stupid ex-wife also had bought...  Sorry, I interrupted you there, but I wasn't sure if that mayor was going to say anything.  It went live, so I apologize. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  She also had borrowed a big fur coat for the occasion.  Ew.  Who's that?  Joe Namath?  Yeah, like we were hot shots.  Where was it?  It's so bad.  Whose fur coat?  I don't even remember.  It might have been a relative, like an aunt or something.  Did the fur coat get returned in one piece?  I think it did.  Okay.  Probably had a fucking Jack Daniels spilt on it.  Poor fucking dead animal.  Yeah, in hindsight, I wish somebody would have thrown paint on her. 
[00:30:30]  You were big shots, night in a town.  Oh, night in a town.  Big limousine.  Went to the Russian tea room.  Russian tea room for one of the included dinners with the show deals.  It wasn't even like, oh, you know, let's go here and do something.  Well, who was in the Russian tea room?  What do you mean?  It was the place to go, but it was the place to go for all us loser Long Island people.  Exactly.  It was like...  So the whole place was filled with loser Long Island people. 
[00:31:00]  Like ourselves.  Yes.  It was definitely...  Because when you bought the tickets to the show, you also had the option of buying a dinner  at the Russian tea room.  So you would get it as part of the deal.  Right.  And like you said, yeah, the whole place is just full of people that also opted for  the deal.  But they talked about the Russian tea room as being this special place.  Yeah.  But I guess it's not a special place anymore.  Maybe back in the day it was.  Maybe.  But now they decide this is a way we could keep it going.  Yeah.  The legendary Russian tea room. 
[00:31:30]  So fucking embarrassing.  And you walk in and you're like, what, dad?  That's my plumber over there.  So embarrassing.  Right.  And then I remember going to a fucking family event or something after that and sitting  and talking to the family.  Oh, Katz was great.  It was fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  No, we took a limo in.  We took a limo in.  Can you imagine being in there?  It's a big night out.  And you think you're hot shit waiting for celebrities.  And you look over and you're like, wait, that's the guy that put my air conditioning in. 
[00:32:00]  What the fuck is he doing?  What is he doing here?  Who's that?  He's picking up off the floor.  Exactly.  Just, oh, what a fucking asshole.  Let me say hi to Don in Pennsylvania.  Don.  Is Don on the phone?  Hey, man.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Nope.  I think those limos are so hacky prom shit.  But I got to tell you, I love to get the Hummer limo and take my kids from Little League  at the end of the year to get ice cream. 
[00:32:30]  That's about all they're good for.  Yeah, I mean, it works for that age, of course.  Hummer limo.  You said those things in the wrong order, sir.  Love you, Jimmy.  Of course it works for kids that age.  We're talking about we're grown people and we think we're cool and we go in a limo.  Limo.  Yeah, that's crap.  All right, Rob.  I just can never get the image of the movie Big out of my head when I'm in a limo.  It's like he would find this entertaining with the door locks.  It was fucking great. 
[00:33:00]  We were in a limo.  We were in a few limos in Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember the dick that goes, I don't like limos.  Yeah.  We're guilty of this.  Yeah.  Yes.  When we put out the minute world with that shyster.  That's right.  With that shyster.  Shyster.  We were celebrating that the CD was doing really well.  It was charting nationally and stuff.  So we get the bright idea.  We get a limo and go to Little Italy. 
[00:33:30]  Not Little Italy.  The North End.  Yeah.  For some Italian food.  At the restaurant where the guy would hit on my girlfriend at the time every single time we went.  Well, she let it be known that she didn't want any part of it.  Oh, yeah.  Of course she did.  Did she?  No.  No, she didn't.  She loved the attention.  Yeah.  And so we pick up the guy in the limo.  And me and Ann are like, isn't this great?  You know, the CD's doing well.  We'll have a nice dinner in North End. 
[00:34:00]  And got a limo.  This fucking shyster had to actually say, actually, I don't like limos.  I don't like limos.  Really?  What a dick.  Rain on our parade.  As he's counting the fucking cash on the side.  Counting the poster money.  Did you guys do really well on that CD financially?  Oh, Jesus, dude.  Oh, boy.  God, it sold so well.  And we might have made, maybe we made $10,000 each.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe. 
[00:34:30]  Whoops.  Maybe.  Yeah.  I think we were splitting a quarter per unit or something.  Shakers and deal makers.  That's what we were.  Wasn't that what we were, wasn't it like a quarter or was it 75 cents?  I'm trying to remember.  I don't even remember anymore.  It's been so many years now.  Oh, you mean 25 cents?  You don't mean a quarter as in percentage?  No.  Oh, no.  I mean a literal quarter.  I think it might have been 75 cents.  I think.  Yeah, maybe.  75 cents per CD we made that we had a split.  How did Bob let that happen?  37.  It was before Bob.  This was pre-Bob.  Oh, okay.  37 and a half cents each per unit sold. 
[00:35:00]  And we didn't, but his accounting was horrible.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So in the end, I don't think it even came out to 37 and a half cents each per unit.  Yeah.  And then we sold a shitload of T-shirts with the Demento World logo on it and posters.  We never made a CD again because we had such a horrible experience.  We're like, who would do this?  And the guy would have just a stack of cash. 
[00:35:30]  All our fans were buying the posters at the time and the T-shirts.  And there he is.  We've told the story a million times, but I love telling these stories all over and over again.  In the corner, just counting out the money as we're just signing for eight straight hours.  With his back toward us, like trying to hide it.  Right.  What a prick.  I think I nudged Dan, like, look at that point.  There he is.  Just counting.  And then the shyster wasn't even smart enough to, like, print more copies when we moved to New York. 
[00:36:00]  He would have made a killing, especially back then.  You know.  Yeah.  I think his accounting was shoddy.  Oh, boy, was it.  A little shoddy accounting, yes.  Oh, boy, was it.  And then he wanted to represent us and be our agents.  Oh, my God.  Brought us to a food court at a mall somewhere in Boston with, like, this big black guy who was cool.  He came around.  Yeah, he was a good guy.  He wasn't a bad guy.  But he was supposed to be, like, the intimidation.  Yeah, he was supposed to be his muscle or something.  His muscle.  And they had contracts they wanted us to sign in a food court at a mall. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Thank God we were smart enough to say, get the fuck out of here.  Take a hike.  Right.  Who knows what that contract said.  We'd probably be still indebted to him.  Oh, probably.  Yeah.  You'd have to get out of it.  You'd have to have Luca Brasi put a gun to his head.  I don't even know what happened to that guy.  Yeah.  He finally went away.  Thank God.  He was such full of shit.  He was the Bozo guy, right? 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  The new Bozo.  He represented the new Bozo.  And he thought we would.  And that was his big pitch to us.  Like, hey, look at my stable of clients.  Right.  Bozo.  And we're like, Bozo?  Bozo the Clown.  The new Bozo.  My eyebrows went up a little bit.  I'm like, oh, wow, Bozo the Clown.  That's not too bad.  And then it turns out it's the new Bozo.  It's not even the original Bozo.  Bozo.  That's hilarious.  And then the most embarrassing story ever.  You know, the song, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, goodbye. 
[00:37:30]  It's a little band called Steam.  Was that it?  Na-na-na-na.  Yeah.  And he said he named the band because he was in the studio at the time when they were recording that song.  And they needed a name for the band.  And all of a sudden he looked at a radiator or a radiator.  And the steam started coming out of it.  And he said, how about Steam, guys?  How about Steam?  And they went, oh, wow, that's a great idea.  He was telling us this story.  You believe him?  No.  Went on and on.  The story went on and on forever.  And we were just sitting there like, right? 
[00:38:00]  No.  I didn't believe him.  And he probably didn't even say that.  He probably goes, hey, how about we call the band?  That's hot.  Don't touch it.  No, that's no good.  Could you look up the band Steam, their Wikipedia?  I want to see if they have a story on how they were named.  Try to find the part where they came up with the name Steam.  Band History.  Did it have something to do with a radiator?  I mean, it's in there. 
[00:38:30]  Or a radiator.  I guess it depends where you are in the country.  I say radiator because it radiates.  It radiates.  I say radiator because it's rad.  Radiator.  It's rad.  There's no story about their name, huh?  Oh, my God.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I think he was fibbing.  Oh.  What?  Hurry up.  Oh.  Oh.  What do you got there, Sam?  Look up.  And it was a one-hit wonder band, obviously.  They didn't do anything else, I don't think. 
[00:39:00]  No.  Nothing?  Nothing on that?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, no, but it says that, no, it says that the guys who made the song created the band  and they named it Steam.  Oh.  Because it was somebody else's song and they just fucked with it.  Really?  Yeah.  What's that got to do with Steam?  Yeah.  But it had nothing to do with a radiator or anybody else in the studio.  That's what you say.  Yeah.  Exactly, Sam.  Where's the libel of the guy?  It says you. 
[00:39:30]  We heard it from the horse's ass.  Right?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Yeah.  But he had to make sure we knew that he didn't like limos.  Yeah.  When we weren't making a lot of money, we kind of put out a few bucks for that because  we were having a special night to celebrate the success of our CD.  Very special.  We weren't going to make a dime off, basically.  Very special night.  I took a limo with you.  Do you remember we took a limo together early on when I first started going into NEW? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And it was to a penthouse event.  I think Anthony had met us.  You might have even been in the car.  I don't remember.  Oh.  But I remember Opie saying to me, like, we're going to get you some money.  You keep coming in.  We're going to get you some money.  I remember that was where you told me you were going to get me some money.  And soon that's going to happen, Jimmy.  Yeah, and maybe someday.  He told me that recently.  Wow, I remember this.  Yes, we were on our way to a penthouse event.  I don't remember what the event was.  To look at some tits.  Yes, we were there to look at some tits.  And, yeah, for some reason that stuck out. 
[00:40:30]  Like, we're going to get you some money.  I used to go to a lot of strip clubs.  I don't remember this penthouse event.  I don't either.  I just remember because it was one of my first, like, oh, my God, there's going to be some chicks here.  Like, you know.  And we weren't a burden when we showed up.  Like, they were happy to see you.  I was like, oh, my God, the show came.  Wow.  I don't remember what it was.  All right.  We're going to take a break, even though it's halfway through.  Oh, you ate too already.  Yeah, I just could eat my oatmeal.  Oatmeal.  We'll break and get into some other things here. 
[00:41:00]  Indeed.  Oh, we played.  Is she coming in, the Duke porn star?  She will be.  I mean, not today, but, yeah.  Soon, right?  Yeah.  Nice.  We didn't talk to her.  We played some of the clubs from Piers Morgan.  I watched a few of her porns over the weekend.  Someone was saying.  Someone was tweeting me overnight saying that her calves are fucked up or something.  Oh, she's a cutter.  She is a cutter.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I heard that.  You can see some scarring on her legs and stuff.  Right up my alley.  Perfect.  Perfect. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  Please.  Would you bang her?  Oh, fuck yes.  A second.  That cutting thing's rough.  Who invented that shit?  I don't know.  That helps Jim Norton, though.  The more they cut, the more likely I am to have some quality they enjoy.  That's what I guess.  Oh, it's terrible.  If a girl is drinking heavy and you see those cut marks, they'll turn you off.  I'm in.  Yeah.  I'm in.  Yeah.  You smell that shit out.  I can smell them the way Hannibal Lecter could smell Laird Dutton. 
[00:42:00]  That's fucking great.  Opie and Anthony.  Elliot Spitzer apologized for his hooker scandal six years ago.  That's not six years ago, is it really?  Come on.  Got the U2 on the radio.  Nice.  There will be no new U2 album or tour until 2015. 
[00:42:30]  Did they put out an album, though?  Yeah, right.  Didn't they?  Wasn't that an album?  I don't know what that was.  That was just a single.  No.  What about that other song, though?  The cover.  Well.  That was the other side of the single.  They had one song that was on that Mandela soundtrack.  Right.  And then they had just another song.  Why does anyone care?  Like, why is that something to announce?  You're not going to put out an album.  Because everybody assumed that it would be out this year. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's postponing the album.  So, assuming they came out with that song to promote an album that they thought would  be out soon.  Uh-huh.  That means they're not happy with what they got.  That's all that's about.  Thought it was shite.  Said, oh, boy.  This is shite.  This is shite.  Did everyone say it?  What the fudge?  Yes, that, too.  What the fudge?  When's St. Paddy's Day?  Next Monday?  I thought it was today.  Did you?  Yeah, it's next Monday.  Oh, okay.  Why did Huntington have it so early? 
[00:43:30]  They didn't want to compete with the New York one?  Probably.  Did they do the parade right?  Yeah.  Although that parade is crap, too.  They're all parades.  They suck.  Just ancient forms of fucking entertainment for people.  I love a good parade.  I hate a parade.  I hate a parade.  All those school bands, they would have nothing to do if we didn't have parades.  Parades.  That's what it's for.  Yeah, the school band.  Yeah, I'm not a parade, a parade guy. 
[00:44:00]  Louis C.K. is going to be on SNL.  Again?  That's awesome.  Oh, yeah.  What, like two weeks?  Two weeks from this coming Saturday, so two and a half weeks, whatever.  He must be promoting, I'm guessing, the new season of Louis.  That's awesome.  Good for Louis, man.  Oh, right.  You taped something, right?  Of course.  Did you?  Of course. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Was it fun?  Yeah, I ran right through the scene.  That was all I did, was I ran through the scene with my arms over my head going,  Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis.  But they're going to use it.  I wasn't booked.  I just did it.  U2's waiting to complete the record until they can book recording sessions with their producers,  Ryan Tedder and Paul Epworth.  How busy are these guys?  Well, if you're Ryan Tedder and Paul Epworth, wouldn't you drop everything because U2 is  waiting for you? 
[00:45:00]  You would think.  Like, what are they working on instead?  I feel like U2 doesn't, they don't have to wait for anybody.  Yeah.  They're U2.  Don't they just call up and say, hey, idiots, we want to record today?  Yeah.  Oh, look at his dumb hipster hat.  Maybe that's the excuse, though.  Yeah.  Maybe that's what they're just saying.  Yeah.  I bet you they're not happy with how it's sounding or something.  The Edge, U2's guitarist, said that the group has 30 songs we're really excited about in  various states of being finished.  In an interview with Rolling Stone last year. 
[00:45:30]  Was he wearing his hat?  Was he wearing his wool cap when he gave that interview?  He sure was.  Oh, Edge.  He sure was.  Ryan Tedder.  Yeah.  It's a big deal.  Yeah, but U2's a big deal.  Did you see the U2 rejection letter that went viral over the weekend?  What is that about?  And I love the people that go, well, obviously the guy was right.  What?  I'm like, look, idiot, if I was going to respond to these people, which I don't anymore, because 
[00:46:00]  you just realize there are a lot of shitty people out there, and there's a lot of people  that have hate in their hearts.  Yes, we're three of them.  So it's not worth even arguing with them, because they don't want to hear any truth bombs.  Right.  They'll always just spin it to prove that they have hate in their hearts.  But people are like, you know, obviously this guy was right, and I want to write these  people back and go, no, he wasn't right.  This band has made billions of dollars for people.  What's the letter?  I didn't see it. 
[00:46:30]  It's from RCO Records.  Was it a guy being sarcastic?  Oh, RSO.  RSO Records, excuse me.  RSO Records.  Yeah, the Bee Gees and shit back then.  Yeah, they were a big record label for a while.  And this was from May 10th, 1979.  And it's Bono's home address at the time, 10 Cobblewood Road, Dublin.  And then it just has an 11?  Is that just an 11?  I think that's...  What is that?  IL for Ireland.  Oh, okay.  I can't see that from here. 
[00:47:00]  I'm sorry.  Ireland, hiya.  Can you read it?  Because it's hard to see from where I'm at.  10th May, 1979.  Dear Mr. Hewson.  Bono's last name, of course.  Thank you for submitting your tape of, quote, U2 to RSO.  You see that?  Of your tape of, quote, U2.  U2.  They don't even know what U2 is yet.  We've listened with careful consideration, but feel it is not suitable for us at present. 
[00:47:30]  We wish you luck with your future career.  Yours sincerely.  Say the guy's name!  What are you, crazy?  Alexander Sinclair.  How'd it work out for them?  Their future endeavors and whatnot.  They made a lot of money, man.  Yeah?  Billions!  So that's why you can't say, well, obviously the guy was right.  No.  Maybe it's not your taste, and that's fine if you're not into U2, but you can't argue the  fact that they're still an extremely successful band making a lot of money for people.  Are you sure the guy's not kidding when he said, obviously, that they were right?  No, you can tell the difference. 
[00:48:00]  No, you can tell the difference.  Huh.  That's, uh...  Yeah, RSO had, like, the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, I think.  Nice.  How do you know that?  I remember seeing the logo on the album spinning round and round in my fucking house all the  time, because my mom had to play it constantly.  Look up RSO.  I want to see who they liked instead of U2.  In 1979, that was when U2 was hitting.  That was around Boy, I do believe, was 79, right? 
[00:48:30]  Just a couple of years later, you got MTV breaking in there everywhere.  Everything.  Everything.  Tink-a-tink-a-tink-a-tink-a.  They were, uh, I guess a management label and then released soundtracks.  Oh, okay.  So they managed the careers of the Bee Gees, Yvonne Elliman.  Yvonne Elliman.  Eric Clapton.  Yeah.  And Andy Gibb.  Okay.  That's a lot of money right there, though.  Yeah.  Those fucking Gibb brothers, holy shit.  They did all right.  As a record label, released the soundtracks to Fame, Sparkle, Empire Strikes Back, Return 
[00:49:00]  of the Jedi, Times Square, Grease, and Saturday Night Fever.  Okay.  That's their hits, though.  Major successes.  Those are big fucking hits.  They couldn't squeeze U2 in there?  Yeah.  Between those soundtracks.  Disastrous commercial and critical failure of RSO's movie version of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely  Hearts Club.  Yikes. 
[00:49:30]  And crippled the company.  Wow.  Crippled.  How much did they put into this one shit movie?  How does that cripple the company when they have all those other success stories?  And then in 1980, the label's most famous act, the Bee Gees, filed a $200 million lawsuit  against them.  Maybe that's how it happened.  Flaiming mismanagement.  So U2 is mismanagement.  Obviously.  Yeah.  Bum-a-roo.  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  Mismanagement.  Yes.  I didn't hear it.  Did you say that as a person? 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  Oh, you should be killed.  That is terrible.  That'll do it.  Getting sued by the Bee Gees.  Yep.  And that terrible fucking...  That's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie.  I don't even remember it anymore.  It had like...  Who was the cast?  Because they all sang...  Give us the trailer.  It's so bad.  It was the Bee Gees.  It was the Bee Gees, but they were...  And Peter Frampton.  Yes, but there were a lot of guest stars in there that sang Beatles songs horribly. 
[00:50:30]  How could that be a bad movie?  Oh, wow.  Is this the trailer?  Oh, but hold onto your hats.  Hot Air Balloon?  Oh.  Oh, it looks bad.  It looks bad.  Barry Gibb?  Or is that Andy Gibb?  Nah, I don't know. 
[00:51:00]  It is.  They're just singing in front of a bunch of cheering fans in like a gazebo.  Oh, George Burns.  George Burns.  These instruments have the power to make dreams come true.  And as long as they remained in the Heartland's care, humanity would live happily forever after.  Steal the instruments.  Oh, boy.  Does this look bad?  Oh, and these guys are stealing the instruments and they tie George Burns up.  Fast motion. 
[00:51:30]  They're trying to make it like a Beatles-y movie.  Oh, my.  This is like Kiss Beats the Phantom.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Kim Cattrall?  We love Mike.  What?  I don't know.  What's going on here?  Oh, Steve Martin.  Steve Martin.  Oof.  Oh, imagine rehearsing this.  Oh, he hit his knee with the thing.  Get it. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Steven Tyler.  Wow.  Much younger Steven Tyler.  Peter Frampton with some hair.  This is horrible.  They're struggling for the might stand.  Earth, Wind, and Fire.  And Little Brother.  This looks atrocious.  It's really bad.  I'm so embarrassed.  Peter Frampton.  Peter Frampton's hair is falling out as they're filming.  They're just gluing it back in place. 
[00:52:30]  I love the zaps that just put all of a sudden the Sgt. Pepper's outfits on.  It's so bad.  Oh, the little fake boxing glove coming out.  Goofy.  Who would enjoy this?  Uh, who was that?  Oh, my God.  Does this look bad?  I know we're just watching TV on the radio.  I can't.  I don't know what to say about it. 
[00:53:00]  It's so incredibly bad, but you can't really.  They're just showing you the end, basically, George.  The big party at the end is right.  Yeah, yeah, I guarantee that's the big party at the end.  Oh, my God.  Look at those special effects are great.  Isn't this great?  So, I guess that, um, crippled, that crippled RSO.  Wow.  How much did they lose on that, I wonder?  Probably a lot.  Peter Frampton.  Brampton.  The BJs.  The BJs.  Yes. 
[00:53:30]  Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club.  That was Key Barton.  Paul Nicholas.  What?  What?  Aerosmith.  Wow.  Alice Cooper.  Cooper.  Oh, boy.  Earth, wind, and fire.  Donald Pleasance.  Billy Preston.  Look at this all-star character.  George Burns.  As Mr. Kite.  Mr. Kite.  Oh, come on.  Donald Pleasance.  You are Sergeant Pepper.  You're the Duke of New York. 
[00:54:00]  Why did this cripple RSO, though?  They sort of had a bad movie, whatever.  Because they probably paid a lot of money.  To get all those people?  Yeah, and no one gave a flying fuck about it.  Wouldn't you know if, for whatever reason, you don't have the Beatles in this movie, it's  not worth doing?  Right.  There's no way.  Why couldn't the Beatles be in the movie?  Why would they?  They were probably like, that piece of shit.  What was Ringo doing?  Ah, Ringo.  At least get Ringo.  They could at least get Ringo, and then if you get Ringo, maybe you get George. 
[00:54:30]  You'd have to pay for the music rights, too, and that's probably what cost them a lot  of money.  Yeah, that's probably what cost them a lot.  You're right.  And the special effects.  You saw the lightning ball on first.  Did you see the, speaking of music, the Pete Townsend?  What now?  Oh, boy.  More research?  Uh, a video of them questioning Pete Townsend.  Oh, about his, uh...  Yeah, from 2000, uh, whatever the hell, about 2005 or something like that?  About his, um... 
[00:55:00]  Oh, I had it on my Twitter, if you want to go there, Sam Roberts.  Oh, I was doing some research.  It's really sad.  That was all.  That was all.  Impressing.  But they're so polite and nice to Mr. Townsend.  Yeah?  As they question him.  Mr. Townsend.  Um, keep going down, or go to YouTube.  Oh, no.  Or somewhere around there.  Oh, no.  Or accidentally downloaded some pictures.  Yeah.  Aye?  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:55:30]  No?  I thought they was eating lollipops.  Looked like lollipops with big fleshy things on them.  Oh, I was doing a little research, eh?  We'll go to YouTube and put Pete Townsend in there.  And, uh, it might pop up that way.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Make sure you spell it right.  That's hard and perfect.  Oh, so bad.  It's terrible.  Townsend.  I would watch that to get annoyed.  There it is.  You know, like George Burns' part?  Ugh.  Here we go.  Walking Pete in. 
[00:56:00]  Of possession of child pornography.  Oh, boy.  Uh, and also inciting another to distribute child pornography.  Oh, boy.  Hey, do you understand what we've been brought here?  All right?  Yeah, we heard Tommy.  That's me.  I wrote it.  Let me go.  Trading it down at the station, though.  Look at that.  Yeah, he doesn't look none too happy about this.  Okay. 
[00:56:30]  So, possession, um, inciting others to do so.  It's not, it's likely another to, another to distribute child pornography.  Oh.  That's my child.  I'd like to let you all know I wrote Quadrophenia.  It's fucking brilliant.  Let me go.  It's a home address.  I don't know why they didn't edit this, but.  Yeah.  Boy, is it Peter?  I need four legs, please.  Peter.  Dennis.  Land. 
[00:57:00]  Susan.  Oh, boy.  Poor guy.  Looks like he's been up all night.  Oh, yeah.  Looking at pictures.  Oh.  Yeah, researching.  Research.  Research, yes.  Did he have no images on his computer, though?  It was just that he was proving you could use a credit card to buy the porn?  Yeah, something like that.  19th of May, 1945.  1945.  45. 
[00:57:30]  So, what is he?  He's like 69 now.  69.  Just, just under 65.  You ever see Woodstock, the movie?  Um, I was, I was there.  Take a place of birth, please.  It's on stage.  My band.  My mates.  Can I go now?  Please.  Cole, C-O-L-E-S.  C-O-L-E-S, yes.  It's Brian.  D-R-I-A-N.  Cole.  D-S.  D-S.  And, uh, M-I-T West. 
[00:58:00]  M-I-T West is the local station.  Oh, boy.  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  The thing is panicking around right now.  Oh, is he a panicky Peter?  Is he just getting the basic info?  Yes.  From him?  Here, Mr. Townsley, whilst you're at the police station, you have certain rights.  The first of those is to speak to an independent solicitor.  To clear charge, you have one present, okay?  The second is to have someone told you you've been arrested.  You can also consult with Code of Practice, which is a book of ours that covers out powers  and procedures, okay? 
[00:58:30]  Do you want anyone informed that you've been arrested?  Yes.  You do.  If you want to be informed.  Do you want to consult with Code of Practice now, as it covers out powers and procedures?  Okay.  Have I informed you that I wrote my generation?  Oh, he's putting his old mirror glasses on.  His spectacles. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Reviewing.  It's just up here.  Yes.  What?  What?  What's that?  Oh, the next line there, to say, you want to speak to Smith as you have one present.  They aren't polite, aren't they?  Yes.  Maybe you've heard bin ball wizard.  Me.  Again, me.  You can't arrest a genius.  Oh, man. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, he's panicking.  He just looks like some old dude.  Can you pause this real quick?  He's sitting there going, I wonder what they got.  Oh, God.  If you're doing research, why are you so nervous?  If you're doing that research and you almost expect to get caught, why are you that nervous?  It's my opinion that he is one of the luckiest men alive.  I agree.  Okay.  That's my opinion.  Is it your opinion he dodged a bullet?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  A little hairless bullet. 
[01:00:00]  You've got to say it's your opinion.  Trust me.  Yeah.  You know.  He could have been Gary Glitter.  But I don't know.  It's way too fishy.  Yeah.  He got very lucky, I do believe.  They couldn't nail him on it officially.  No.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Keep going.  The video's been mundane.  It's fascinating.  Everybody that comes in the PlayStation, they might sound personal, the questions, but it's  to try and help people out, those people that need help or are at risk, okay? 
[01:00:30]  Are you suffering from the illness injury or medical or mental health condition?  Well, a little deafness from, you know, playing in front of festival crowds.  My arm hurts from doing that windmill thing that everyone has seen because I'm famous...  It's a bit dodgy.  He says it's hearing.  Yeah, it's hearing.  There's help to get to people with learning difficulties who went to a special school who  suffered from mental health problems.  Can you do that help at all?  I'm sure you can send it.  Do you help for any other reason? 
[01:01:00]  Not that I can think of.  Obviously, if you can think of anything that comes to life, so let me know again.  There's also a drug referral scheme operates at this police station.  If you're interested, I can arrange for you to be seen by an independent drugs worker in  due course.  Are you interested in that at all?  Thank you.  Sweet believer.  Two more signatures, please.  Thank you.  They're very cordial.  Oh, really nice.  They're arresting you for possible child pornography.  Right.  Two more signatures, yeah.  Yeah.  And one's for me, son. 
[01:01:30]  Big fan.  Deciding who's next.  That guy could put anything in front of him and tell him a sign.  Right.  You think that guy's freaking out like, holy fuck, this is Pete Townsend from the fat sergeant  or whatever?  He's looking at him.  His mouthpiece.  He's got the evidence back. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  We've got to take things from you that might harm yourself or any of us, okay?  Or might aid your escape.  You understand that?  Yes, dude.  I can't see if we've got to come in.  Hurry up, chief.  We've got that Eric Clapton arson case we're working on.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  He's just emptying his pockets now.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  God knows I'm going to fall out of that coat.  Some underoos.  Yes.  One, one, one, one imitation, red leather. 
[01:02:30]  Showing some fans outside the police station.  Oh, yeah.  The last thing you want to see in a police station is your computer in a baggie.  Isn't that the truth?  Oh, Pete.  Contained in a file.  Hmm. 
[01:03:00]  Marked Internet child abuse.  Oh.  File.  Internet child abuse.  Oh, boy.  That one from Big Nose.  Yeah.  And there's suddenly being Keith Moon about now, isn't it?  It's a viable option.  Oh, Jesus.  That guy's a rock star.  Boy, you don't want to be this guy. 
[01:03:30]  No.  Barclay card statement.  August 2002.  Right.  Looks like older footage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From that address.  Right.  Anything else we've got to come in as well?  Yeah, there's a lot of other stuff on route.  Okay.  How serious are the charges he could face?  Potentially very serious.  Just a confession of indecent images of children could give him five years in jail. 
[01:04:00]  It all depends on the number of offenses and the scope of those offenses.  Now, Pete Townsend himself, of course, has said that he only went into one internet site  once, and that was only for research purposes.  But there have been all manner of groups, including children's charities, lining up today to say  that there's simply no defense for this, and that just looking is illegal.  Okay.  Okay.  You'll come to me.  Where's the book, by the way, that he was working on?  Yeah, yeah.  Where is that?  I guess he gave up. 
[01:04:30]  What's going on there?  He's leaving with his lawyers.  Apparently here.  Two cops are talking.  Yeah.  Legalese. 
[01:05:00]  We can pick it up from there as a support for him.  There's obviously issues there, but I'm with you on his group.  Because the office has been made, so they're quite aware of it.  And we'll make it again before he goes.  By the way, this cop is in that age group.  That's probably one of his fucking heroes.  I just think of the same thing.  Yeah, he's right in that demo.  Right.  They all grew up listening to The Who.  Yeah.  Is that his computer they're carrying in?  Oh, God.  It looks like a computer in a baggie. 
[01:05:30]  You never want to see that.  Computer in a baggie.  Oh, boy.  Because you know what you've done on it.  Oh, naughty, naughty boy.  Naughty, naughty.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I don't know the whole story there.  I don't know how, like, what it actually was that he got off.  Like, I don't know what the, uh, what it was.  Did it, was it dismissed?  Did he get acquitted?  Did he have no images and he'd only gone one time?  Yeah.  I don't think you should go to jail for that if it's legitimately a researcher.  Well, thank you, Jim. 
[01:06:00]  How do you research it?  By looking at the pictures.  You know what the pictures are.  No, no, no.  But they, can you join the site without, I don't know what he was doing.  I'm just.  All right.  Yeah, I don't remember, like, what he was doing.  Right.  He had pictures.  Well.  Oh, no.  Pause.  There's a lot.  Oh, there's a lot of computers.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  The Apple hard drive.  There's a lot of computer equipment.  And there's some in the back.  You see there, too?  Oh, man.  How many computers did this motherfucker have? 
[01:06:30]  When you're in the Who, you have a lot of good computers.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, Pete.  Look at all the tools.  Twelve computers.  Twelve.  Various diaries and notes.  And a copy of the statement he made to the press when the story broke.  And not a telephone.  Not until his computers have been examined that the police will know if there is any further evidence against him.  Further.  But he has publicly admitted that he paid to view the landslide website, which in itself is a crime of incitement. 
[01:07:00]  The police are now ready to formally interview him.  Uh-huh.  Pause.  Now, if you're going to do this for research and you're going to go to one of these websites and you're going to pay to get in there to show that you could do that.  Uh-huh.  Wouldn't you alert everybody that you're going to do that?  You'd think you would talk to a lawyer.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And say, look, I'm going to show you how easy this is to do.  And the lawyer would be like, what, you're fucking crazy?  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Pay a fan to do it.  Yeah.  Right.  There you go.  Your housekeeper or somebody.  But why would you do that on your own like that?  That's fishy.  Hmm.  Luckiest guy in the world.  Well, you're a big name.  So if you think there's an issue here, then you could show the world.  You would certainly alert the media before you actually do it, I think.  Yeah.  Anyway.  I picture a scene like that in front of fucking Denny's house with his hard drive and kids.  I mean, I can. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Keep going.  Oh, there might be one or two images.  I did subscribe to that website on that day.  I felt that I, using my real name, that I would be able to enter and research and see 
[01:08:30]  what was going on on the website.  That's what happened.  And I greatly regret inciting others to do so.  I was planning to campaign.  I was in the middle of a campaign to try to shut down the user groups.  Or to start a lot of your voice to shut down the user groups.  And I wanted to know.  Rough boys under the sheets.  I want to buy it and kiss you.  Really?  This is not really going on. 
[01:09:00]  What's really going on is just money changing hands.  And I wanted to see the reality of it.  Because what was being supplied free on advertising banners was so horrific.  Alberto, did it contain child pornography?  I can't remember.  I just remember being, it may have had images on it of children.  They may have been in a state of undress.  I can't really recall.  I certainly. 
[01:09:30]  Could you pause for one second?  I can't really recall.  How do you not remember if you saw nude children fucking?  And that's like what you're researching.  And I love the who, man.  I mean, that behind blue eyes spoke to me.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He probably thought it was about you.  Of course I did for a moment or two.  But this is way too fishy.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I personally don't believe him.  That's my opinion on him.  I don't.  I'm listening to him talk.  And I just don't buy it.  No, he might be truthful. 
[01:10:00]  Sure.  I just don't believe him.  You have too much to lose as a huge celebrity like that, so you would make sure everything  is set up nicely before you did that, so you wouldn't be in this position, right?  What is that other site?  Is that another site that he had looked at?  I'm not following.  They said that.  Oh, why do you want to know, Jimmy?  Well, just so I know.  I can try to go join it real quick.  But no, I'm wondering if that's another site.  And then maybe he was on another site and looked at stuff and didn't report.  I don't know.  I don't know if that's why they're asking him.  Yeah, Sam, go back slightly.  I don't know. 
[01:10:30]  It begins with an A.  Yeah, like Alberto or whatever it was called.  Yeah, we'll go back slightly and see what, I don't know.  Because what was being supplied free on advertising banners was so horrific.  Alberto, did it contain child pornography?  I can't remember.  I just remember being, it may have had images on it of children.  They may have been in a state of unrest.  I can't really recall.  I certainly don't remember. 
[01:11:00]  I don't, they had not been burned into my subconscious and my memory on the way that the first images that I stumbled upon.  Pause, they're not arresting you because it might be burned into your subconscious.  Yeah, yeah.  They're arresting you because it might have been burned onto a disc.  Right.  That's the problem.  Did it contain, I don't know.  I was trying to have a wank.  Yeah.  Just a quick wank.  I think he's a lucky man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a rough one, man.  Mm-hmm.  If anyone knows how this played out, please give us a call. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, because Pete Townsend, if I could have fun of him, they got mad about that.  Yeah, this is about eight years old now, nine years old, so obviously he's safe.  So what was the thing that got him off the hook?  Yeah.  And what did he actually have on his computer compared to what people might think he had on his computer?  Yeah.  Yeah, who knows this shit?  Give us a call.  Some of the fans are like, dude, you don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, because I've mocked him or said I thought he was guilty.  And they're like, no, he wasn't guilty.  Yeah, but he paid to go on one of these sites.  That seems pretty crazy to me for research. 
[01:12:00]  Better ways to do research.  Yeah.  You're Pete Townsend.  Yeah.  Pete.  He probably assumed he...  I don't know.  I'm not going to...  I'm going to keep going there, Sam.  Which were free.  Those I remember very well.  And those were the ones which really burned me up because it was maybe less than seven keystrokes in Google  that got me to that place.  How many dickstrokes?  And I thought my son, who's a young boy, could so easily stumble upon this. 
[01:12:30]  I wanted to see what was going on in the real world.  And I understand that it was stupid.  Terrific images.  It was the trailer for Sgt. Pepper's Lentine Arts Club Band.  Sam, go back again.  It was horrible.  Fucking Pete. 
[01:13:00]  A lot of people say Pete Townsend was sexually abused as a child.  I've heard that.  Yes, I've heard that too.  So that might have let...  I don't know.  It said that in the statement that the little text they showed...  Yeah, his grandma or some shit.  Yeah, he was researching his autobiography.  And it had something to do with that.  Between five and six, I saw that too.  And that said something about Tommy under it.  It really did.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you're...  Just because you were sexually abused, maybe that's true.  But that doesn't make it, like, legal.  Right.  Like, you know... 
[01:13:30]  You don't get a free pass like the N-word.  No.  Yeah, or if you were abused as a kid, a lot of, you know...  If you were abused as a child, then that might turn a switch on in your head to...  Yeah.  How many molesters were molested?  Probably a lot of them I would get.  Right.  Yeah.  That got me to that place where there was a list in front of me.  And I thought my son, who's a young boy, could so easily stumble upon this.  And I wanted to see what was going on in the real world. 
[01:14:00]  And I understand that it was stupid.  Can you recall those images now that you say they've burnt you up?  I remember the one image in particular, which was of a young baby boy...  Um, being sexually, um, um, sublimized by an adult, a boy.  And...  And I think that's about the worst thing that I've seen. 
[01:14:30]  And I was very disturbed by it and very angered by it.  Do you appreciate that the actions that you did entering that site and viewing the material was wrong?  Absolutely.  Okay.  And that by subscribing to Landslide, that $5, you called them to distribute the images on that site?  I have to say, you know, I do accept that I apologize for what the trouble... 
[01:15:00]  Was that wrong?  ...everybody in this investigation, and it's complicated, and I feel terrible about it.  I was trying to do something useful, and I was foolish and stupid and ignorant.  What a horrible superhero he is.  Fucking trying to do shit.  Child porn man.  Yeah.  Punching it on.  Able to bust a website with ten easy loads.  He's trying...  He's using his own credit card. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  He's now giving money to this organization that is this website that he's so disgusted by.  Right.  Regardless if you're doing research or anything, you're still giving money to them to continue their abuse.  Five bucks?  What are you going to learn by doing research?  I've never been to any of those sites, but I could pretty much tell you what I would see if I went there.  I guess he wants to know how easy it is.  Easy to join.  To join.  If my son stumbled upon it, you know, after grabbing me credit card. 
[01:16:00]  Nice.  And entering it in.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like, it sounds a little harder than just a few keystrokes.  Seven keystrokes.  Yeah.  He's probably bummed it was seven instead of three.  Yeah.  I'm having trouble with this one.  Yeah.  It's all mine.  I love the Who.  I'm not buying it, Pete.  It's a bit suspicious.  Me and my friend from the Lost Prophets, Ian Watkins, were talking.  Yes.  We was talking with Gary Glitter. 
[01:16:30]  We're almost done with this.  I do accept that I apologize for the trouble that I've caught everybody in this investigation.  I know it's complicated and I feel terrible about it.  There you go.  I was trying to do something useful and I was foolish and stupid and ignorant.  Stupid.  And I, I, arrogant perhaps is the right. 
[01:17:00]  I shouldn't have done it.  I shouldn't have done it alone anyway.  Give me a, give me a call.  We need a while then.  We need a while.  Ready?  I know you deceive me.  Now here's a surprise.  Bow, wah, wah, wah.  Paul is, is having a driver come here in about 10 minutes time.  We, we'd like him to come into the back yard if possible.  Uh-oh.  So that people would be whizzed away.  Uh, I wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to get out of the back or something.  Sean's double. 
[01:17:30]  Ah, the press is on to you.  Yeah.  Well, I've got a funny thing that we're going to get a bit of a stump in here.  We're going to get a little bit of a stump in here.  Yeah.  He just looks like some old dude. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  I've been working with this.  Now he's just kind of standing there waiting to leave.  Awkwardly.  Right.  Videoing him.  Get me out of here.  There he goes.  It's leaving.  Press out there.  No? 
[01:18:30]  I could have been in.  That's the cameraman.  Yeah.  That's about it, I think.  Yeah.  Wow.  He did say in there at the end, I shouldn't have done it alone.  Something we were saying here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Doing research.  You've got to alert everybody.  Yeah.  I'm about to hit this keystroke.  Yeah.  But I want to explain why I'm about to hit this keystroke.  Yeah, I'm putting my credit card into an illegal website. 
[01:19:00]  Right, because all hell's going to break loose when I hit this keystroke.  Yeah.  Unless you're doing it and you're so lathered up, and you're like, well, they would probably  think, why would he do this?  Yes, it's too obvious.  It's too obvious.  Pete Townsend wouldn't use his own fucking credit card.  Just put it in.  Have a wank.  A wank.  Oh, boy.  I don't know, man.  Unless his real name is on his credit card and not Pete Townsend, whatever his birth 
[01:19:30]  name is.  Right.  There's an H in that name, by the way.  Yeah.  I've made that mistake.  Townsend.  Townsend?  Oh.  Town- S-H-E-N-D.  Oh, Townsend.  Yeah.  Townsend.  So how did it work out in the end?  Did we go to the Wikipedia?  What did they decide?  I guess they decided they didn't have enough.  What?  I don't know.  No, he accepted a, uh, what is it called over there?  A police, uh, caution.  Police caution. 
[01:20:00]  Who wouldn't accept that?  Exactly.  Do you have to go to jail for child porn?  All right.  I'll take a good cautioning.  I'll take a police caution.  He was placed on the sex offenders register for five years.  So he's off that.  He's not going to court.  Does he not like to talk about this in interviews?  Oh, my God.  There's an interview from 2012 where he finally talked about it.  I don't think he talked about it in his book or anything.  See, the problem with that is, that's why I don't buy it.  Hey, motherfucker.  You're one of the most famous guitarists on earth, and you're arrested for looking at 
[01:20:30]  child porn.  All you should be doing is talking about this in interviews.  Over and over again.  If it's legit, all you should be doing is explaining yourself.  Right.  And this is the problem, and this is what...  And he didn't talk about it in his book?  No.  He said he chose not to go to court because he was exhausted at the time.  Oh, my God.  What?  Too tired?  Very sleepy.  Yeah.  They were surprised by the police's decision because they all believed that he would be  let off.  But he added that he thought prosecution lawyers would fucking rip me apart if you went to 
[01:21:00]  court.  Right.  But why did he put it in his book?  That was it?  He said...  I'm sorry.  I'm reading well.  He had a nine-year silence on that.  Fuck him.  Fuck Pete Townsend.  Wow.  He struggled to express himself in the book because his actions seemed insane, even to him.  Right.  I didn't know what I was doing.  Get the fuck out of here.  And then you don't talk about it in your book, and then you're not doing interviews  about it?  He probably wrote it down for the book, read it, and went, well, this seems like a lot 
[01:21:30]  of bullshit.  He addressed it a little bit in his book, saying, he described the media storm about  how the scandal began, saying, if I had a gun, I would have shot myself just to escape  the lynching.  But then, to me, where's the lynching when you're not talking about it in interviews?  Right.  You should always explain yourself in interviews.  If you're telling the truth, why wouldn't you just explain yourself?  He's a lucky man.  I bet lawyers told him to shut up.  He was tired.  Yeah, no.  I bet his lawyers told him, don't mention it.  But what is there to shut up about? 
[01:22:00]  The court of public opinion who buys your records, a lot of people think you were downloading  child porn.  You can't use the excuse that you're tired.  Yes.  Considering what they got you on, or what they think they got you on.  Let me say hi to Justin in Ohio.  Justin.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Touching on the subject of getting abused as a child, I'm actually a recovery sex and  relationship addict, Jimmy.  Okay, cool, man.  Guy in my group, he was about five when his adopted brother moved in and started abusing 
[01:22:30]  him, and it kind of just escalated from there, and as he grew older, he would touch other  boys.  And I really think that being abused by a man as a boy makes you gay, although he doesn't  feel that way.  Makes you gay.  I honestly don't know.  Maybe it has an effect on your sexuality, but I have no idea if that's... 
[01:23:00]  Because what if it was a straight guy that abused a girl?  What does that make?  I mean, she just stays straight?  I mean, that doesn't make sense, dude.  Hello?  I think he left.  Well, well, you know, he's still there.  Well, Jimmy's saying that he doesn't think you're...  Yeah, I don't know if that's right.  Well, I mean, how do you...  You don't have enough life experience to figure out if you are gay or not.  And if all you've known is this abuse, and you start doing it to other children, then 
[01:23:30]  yeah, I think you grow up to be gay.  I think an abuse makes you an abuser, but how many kids are gay that weren't abused?  I'm guessing most gay people weren't sexually abused.  That's right.  But back to you, Justin.  I'm not saying that it's automatic.  Where is he?  In Kiev?  Yeah.  I can't hear you guys.  Yeah, I don't know, Justin.  How do you have a business? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I don't know if he's right.  I'm rambling.  Well, I just disagree with your...  I don't know what that goes into making...  I just don't know.  But I don't think that makes you gay.  I mean, maybe it would make you...  Because I'm sure plenty of straight men were abused by men that grow up with fucking rage  towards that or towards...  Gay people, right?  Yeah.  All right, well...  There's the Pete Townsend video.  I'm sure we'll put it up on our Facebook and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Enjoy. 
[01:24:30]  That just surfaced very recently.  I personally...  He's been holding that tape for a long time.  Or he loves that.  I don't buy it.  I personally don't buy it.  Just because he had a nine-year silence...  How the fuck do you have a nine-year silence with what are some of the worst charges you  can possibly get?  Or at least arrested for the worst that you can get?  Right.  How are you silent about that?  I don't know.  Every interview...  So you're on tour.  Yes, but first, let me clear up this whole molesting thing.  For the 10,000th time.  That's all I would talk...  I love interviews when they ask questions about... 
[01:25:00]  Because you get a chance to explain yourself.  Right.  In your own words.  I can't say I was just tired.  Because I didn't want to deal with some shit.  He's sleepy.  You know.  Hey, we've all been tired.  Come on, right?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure he was...  I'm sure he was...  I'm sure he was sleepy when he wrote My Generation.  But he still wrote My Generation.  Right?  Right?  Why are you on a TMZ thing with Arrogant Bieber?  Did you see the Justin Bieber deposition? 
[01:25:30]  No.  What did he do?  This is a pretty good video, actually.  We could do it after the break.  For sure.  And there's a guy, Joey, in New York, wants to talk about the LSD and the meat in Tampa.  Hold through the break.  We'll get to you, Joey.  The late John Embersome.  Look at those bass runs.  What happened with him, right?  A little Coke.  A little Coke.  A little Coke.  Coke.  Got to leave the Coke for the young.  Oh, yeah.  What was that? 
[01:26:00]  What?  What was that?  What?  What was that?  What?  We showed my computer.  Oh.  What were we listening to?  Well, I sometimes will preview and prep stuff over here just in case you want to go to it.  We can be prepared.  So what was that, Claire?  That was Nicole on Friday's post show.  No, we're not doing it.  No.  Yeah, but if things slow down and you go, oh, okay. 
[01:26:30]  No, no, no.  So you don't even want me to preview it over here.  No.  No.  You're just trying to get us to talk about you.  It's very obvious.  Oh, you talk about me every day.  I know.  Trust me.  I know.  Oh, man.  All right.  Let's go to Joey.  Joey's in New York.  He wants to talk about meat and LSD.  What's up, Joey?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hello, Joseph.  Oi.  How are you guys doing today?  All right.  Let's go, Joey.  Yes, you know, I'm just smoking some kush, you know.  Always my morning ritual, just, you know, like the J. 
[01:27:00]  But, yeah, I think it's just funny because back in high school, me and my friends used  to do a lot of acid, and we were one of the cool kids.  We used to, like, drink a lot of beer and have barbecues and stuff like that.  But I was wondering, did you guys even, like, drink in high school?  Because, like, I've been listening to you guys for only, like, a week now, and, like,  you guys definitely sound like you didn't even, like, drink beer in high school.  Like, you guys, like, did you even smoke weed in, like, high school or college, bro? 
[01:27:30]  What does this have to do with LSD and the meat in Tampa?  Well, I mean, I'm just, well, I mean, well, that's a separate issue.  So if we didn't drink beers in high school, we're not cool enough for you?  Well, I'm just wondering.  I mean, because you have to be, like, I mean, you weren't, if you weren't drinking beer in  high school, you weren't cool.  Just saying.  He is right.  I used to hang out with my friends with some road sodas, man.  Oh, man.  Me and my friends would get some road sodas. 
[01:28:00]  We'd drive around.  Did you have a hot girl?  A Spanish girl, though?  Some weed.  What?  You guys, you know, you weren't even, you guys weren't cool in high school.  What?  I don't even understand what this is.  Yeah, I, dude, I took bong rips before class, bro.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Are you doing a character?  Of course he is.  You can talk in the first second he talked.  I'm trying to figure, just say what you want to say.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what it is.  Dancing around.  You're not a good enough actor.  Just do it.  Say it.  Trying to figure out what his gimmick.  All right, well, let me get to the, dog. 
[01:28:30]  Let me get to the, uh.  What's your gimmick?  You know, are you going for a little character thing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, listen, you guys, listen, you guys don't even smoke.  A recurring character?  You guys don't smoke.  The you don't smoke or drink beer guy?  Is that who you want to be?  Listen, buddy, I smoke a lot, dude.  I smoke five beers a day.  All right, good for you.  I guess that makes you cool.  Congratulations.  I'm one of the cool kids in my high school.  I was popular, bro.  So what are you doing now?  How old are you?  Popular in high school, guy?  I'm 24, bro.  I'm a trucker, dude. 
[01:29:00]  Is he trying to be?  What are you doing?  I don't know what the character is.  What are you doing?  The character's too vague still.  It's not congealed yet.  Decide what you want to be when you grow up.  And then call back in that character.  Or get to the slam, whatever this is going to be.  Hurry up.  Just do it.  We're bored.  Yeah.  Wait, what are you talking about?  All right, let me get to the LSD.  So what do you guys think about that?  Come on.  We're eating the meat.  You're terrible.  You're one of the worst fucking...  Look at me.  I'm Joe Rogan. 
[01:29:30]  I'm Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan podcast.  Look at me.  He's the I don't like Joe Rogan guy now.  I don't know who he is.  Yeah, that'll get you far.  Not liking Joe Rogan.  No, I am Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan is a rock star.  Who cares if you don't like Joe Rogan?  Yeah, have fun being the guy that doesn't like Joe Rogan.  Who cares?  He doesn't even know you're alive.  He doesn't give a fuck.  What other character are you going to slip into now?  Yeah, who else are you?  Hopefully it's our Bud Dwyer look-alike contest winner. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, so you don't like Joe Rogan.  You actually called just because you don't like it.  Who cares?  I know he's gone.  Of course he is.  Like, I don't care if you like Joe.  I'm sure Joe doesn't care.  Who gives a shit?  He probably likes Joe, though.  He wanted to do a character.  I don't know what he was going for.  He was going for something that failed miserably.  A character.  Mr. Amos.  Let me say hi to Jason in California.  Jason.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Jason.  Who do you hate? 
[01:30:30]  Bruce Buffer?  You guys really didn't drink beer in high school?  Come on, man.  What the hell is this?  I'm a truck driver now.  You guys are famous radio stars.  I'm a truck driver.  I did bong rips.  You know.  I'm an idiot, dude.  It's ridiculous.  What the fuck is going on today?  If that guy was real, he's probably the saddest he would be out there.  Yeah.  He was going to cack it.  Give the fuck what I did in high school.  I did what everyone else was doing.  I'd sneak some beers in. 
[01:31:00]  Trying desperately to fucking fit.  Right.  Now look at him.  He's a winner.  Yeah.  I wouldn't put myself in the cool category in high school.  That's for sure.  So, whatever.  I was pretty neutral.  Yeah.  I mean, I want to be in the cool group, but...  Well, who didn't?  Let him drive his truck.  Let him drive.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  I had to resort to the army jacket in the back hall crowd.  Yeah.  You know, not really the bad, tough guys, but trying to dress the part, you know. 
[01:31:30]  How far up, uptown, would you put yourself in high school?  What do you mean?  Like, uh...  You know, the higher you go.  I mean, that's some danger.  And those are the real cool kids.  Mm-hmm.  What were you, like, uh...  I wasn't really...  Central Park, the northern section of Central Park.  Yeah, I wasn't really that...  You didn't go too far into the...  Into cool.  Into cool.  People knew me.  You know, I was always, uh...  Joking around and shit like that.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:32:00]  But, uh, as far as being cool, no.  No.  No.  And everybody that was cool and kind of, you know, football team or cheerleader stereotype  thing, uh, turned out to be disasters.  Just fucking disasters.  I see some of them on Facebook sometimes.  They friend me.  Oh, really?  They friend me.  And then I go to their page and I check shit out and I'm like, oh, wow.  I think the cool kids end up... 
[01:32:30]  The cool kids in high school, they end up, like, pooping out.  Yeah, you think it's...  They don't keep that cool momentum going...  Hard to keep it going.  ...in high school.  Yeah.  That's right.  No, they burn out.  Everything they're going to be is in high school.  Yeah.  You don't hear about many cool kids having an amazing, like, career or life after high  school.  Right?  Yeah, it's like...  It's always the underdogs that come up.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, uh...  The nerds, obviously.  Napoleon Dynamite.  Yeah.  Where he wanted the fucking, uh... 
[01:33:00]  He wanted the time machine so he could go back in time and be cool again.  Uncle Rico?  Uncle Rico.  Let me say hi to Tommy in Wisconsin.  Tommy!  Hey!  What are you guys doing?  Like, in high school, I used to, like, drink beers and, like, stuff.  Fucking awesome, bro.  That stuff is great.  That's good. 
[01:33:30]  No bros here, sir.  No bros here.  Dude, dude, I know.  I know you were like child to the age.  Ripping bong hits?  Yeah, man.  We're not cool because we weren't ripping bong hits before school.  A little wake and bake?  What?  I always liked a little wake and bake.  What'd he say?  I used to go to the woods.  It's the beers.  The beers.  Thanks, guys.  You were fucking great. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Let's go to Anthony in Tom's River.  Uh, Anthony.  Hello?  Yo.  Oh, he's, uh...  We're going to have to give up on the phones today.  Yeah.  I want to rip them out of the wall and just burn them.  Yes.  I love phone calls.  They're the worst.  Once in a while, a good one will come in and have some information, but usually they're  just like, nah, that thing you guys said was good.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  What do you got on the Justin Bieber there, Sam Roberts? 
[01:34:30]  Uh, his deposition came out.  Yeah.  And this is for, what, the egg incident?  Yeah.  No, this is, uh, this is, uh...  For speeding, right?  For his people beating up a paparazzi.  Oh.  Yeah, for his bodyguards and stuff.  And, uh, the video's labeled Arrogant Bieber.  Well, there's a couple different montages that have been put together.  Right.  Of him just being a dick?  Yeah, this is the best one.  Just him being a dickhead.  Okay.  I'm on his side so far, though, if they beat up a paparazzi.  It's hard to be against him for this one. 
[01:35:00]  Remember earlier today when I asked you?  No.  Why don't you listen to what I have to say first?  And then maybe you'll tell me this.  I don't have to listen to anything you have to say.  Here's my question.  If you have a question about my question, you have the right to be clear for you to be able  to be clear.  Mr. DeCobbe.  Remember being in Australia ever?  I don't know if I've been to Australia.  Have you been to Australia?  Are you aware that Scooter Braun knows that your bodyguards have attacked photographers? 
[01:35:30]  What kind of question is that?  That didn't make sense.  That's correct, brother.  That doesn't make sense.  That's a weird question.  That doesn't make sense.  He's trying so hard.  I didn't hear your response.  Again, sir, I'm...  You know I didn't finish my...  I didn't finish.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't want to interrupt you.  Really?  You didn't want to interrupt?  Is it true that you know that your security guards won't punch, grab, and push PAPS if they 
[01:36:00]  need to?  I object.  Would you please look at the film that's up there?  What?  Go ahead, sir.  This is a film?  Please, sir.  This is a film?  Pause it.  Would you please watch the television?  You said it's a film.  You said watch the film.  Is this a film?  Is this a...  Is there a difference?  Is this between a film and something else?  Yes.  So yes or no answer required, right? 
[01:36:30]  I think my lawyer's asking you a question.  Please, sir.  I think my lawyer's asking you a question.  I'm not here to answer his questions.  You're here to answer mine.  Have you ever disciplined Mr. Hesney?  Disciplined?  What kind of question is that?  Is he my son?  Guess what?  Guess what?  I don't recall.  Holy shit.  He winks at the camera. 
[01:37:00]  What a dick.  Yeah, but you know what?  He's talking to a...  I think that guy's a lesson.  A cop is talking to him.  No, no.  It's a lawyer.  It's a lawyer.  So I can understand not wanting to cooperate with some scumbag fuck dick lawyer.  He's probably suing him.  Right.  So, but he just comes across looking like an asshole.  Because he's trying too hard.  He's trying too hard.  But yeah, that's probably just some scumbag lawyer he's talking to.  There's another way to do that where you don't come across looking like a fucking dick bag during a deposition.  You just, you know, I don't recall. 
[01:37:30]  I don't recall.  I don't recall.  That's it.  Not like, hmm, what?  Is that a film?  Is that a film?  Oh, he's hateable.  Really is.  He is hateable.  But you are right.  It's a guy that's trying to nail you for something.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess you would be a dick.  He's nice to be nice to him.  He's suing you.  There is a hatred that goes on when you look at a lawyer that's trying to fuck you over.  It is a deep hate that you wish awful things upon them. 
[01:38:00]  Have you felt that before?  Oh, my God, have I ever.  I wished the lawyer that was against me.  I wished that he, his marriage would fall apart.  He would lose his fucking lawyer's ability to practice law.  I wished he would be arrested.  Right.  I wished he was homeless.  Right.  I wished all those things.  Did it happen?  Every single one of them. 
[01:38:30]  Let's say hi to Tim in Jersey City.  Tim.  Oh, hey, guys.  So, I had called you probably a month ago telling you a Lady Di story.  Do you recall about her throwing up at the Burger King?  Yes.  And it turned out it was legit because Lady Di.  What?  Legit.  Oh.  Yes.  You saw Lady Di throwing up outside of Burger King, I think.  Yeah.  Love it.  Correct, yes.  So, the reason I drive, I do deliveries around New York, New Jersey, stuff like that. 
[01:39:00]  Congrats.  So, I'm on the road a lot.  I have video of her.  Watch out.  This car.  Exactly.  Why don't you...  In her car at a Target in Jersey City, she's just sobbing at the steering wheel.  And you got video of this?  What are you doing, you creep?  I want to send this to you guys.  I want to send this to you guys.  Do it immediately.  You want to see it?  I want to send it to you.  How long is the video?  It's like 30, 40 seconds.  Come on.  It was really...  All right.  I'm not lying.  She's a monster.  I have video of it. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Look, look.  We're going to put you on hold.  Right.  Somebody give him an email address.  Can you send this immediately?  I'm in my car right now.  I'd have to stop.  It's on my phone, though.  Let's stop.  Let's drive.  Do like 90 and text.  It's fun.  You wanted to call the show, so why wouldn't you stop now and send the video?  Come on.  I'm like, all right, you guys are difficult, but I'll make it worse.  How difficult.  We need it.  We didn't even know about this until you decided to bring it to our attention.  All right.  Well, all right.  Well, I'll give you guys the goods.  All right.  Hold on a lot. 
[01:40:00]  Can't give us a good tidbit like that and then make us wait.  And we've got to get Lady Di on the phone.  We've got to match the stories.  Make sure this is true.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That didn't happen.  He saw me crying.  Oh, no.  He said he saw me crying.  She may be difficult to get on the phone now that she's famous.  She's got 115,000 followers?  Come on.  Another one like Bobo with these fake followers?  Someone buying them for them?  Yeah.  Lady Di has 115,000 Twitter followers.  How does that even work?  Certain radio show hosts, I think, might do that, too. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  They go up like a whole big bunch.  Oh, yeah.  Todd absolutely bought followers.  You think so?  Yeah.  It's been proven, actually.  How do they prove that?  I don't know the sites where they can show you how many of your followers are fake.  Every one of my followers are actual, 100% authentic pieces of shit.  Yeah, Bobo's up to 223,000 followers.  And Lady Di's at 115,000.  So Lady Di's really believing it.  Yes, she is.  Because she's asking how many followers we have. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  How many followers we have.  He's famous.  Compared to her.  And it should be pointed out, we forgot, and we did say it off mic, that Justin Bieber's  copied Lil Wayne.  That's what I was thinking, too.  Yeah, Lil Wayne did that shit.  We played it on the show.  Which was hilarious.  Lil Wayne knew how to do it properly, where it was really funny.  Plus, he's being genuine.  I think that's who Lil Wayne is.  Right.  Bieber was going for something, knowing that eventually we got out, like, the Lil Wayne  thing got out, and he didn't pull it off as well.  So.  Not at all.  No, I don't think so.  Hang on, we're just working on, uh, getting somebody on the phone. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, good.  Ah.  To the bottom of some things.  Let us know when that video is in.  Well, apparently the asshole hung up.  What?  What a dick.  What?  So we're waiting for him to call back.  What a dick.  The people are stupid.  Where's lying?  A click may be, but he did have the throwing up.  The last time, yeah, the last time he saw him.  That was true. 
[01:42:00]  That is true.  That was true.  It was proven.  I believe him.  By the way, we were talking about the, uh, the airplane crash.  EA.  The Malaysian airplane crash.  Yep.  And, um, Matthew Bishop, who's a good one on the Twitter.  He wrote, Pentagon says none of the, uh, their satellites picked up any explosions.  You know, it's funny, you would think that they, a satellite would pick something up,  but that doesn't, maybe they just weren't looking in that area at the time.  That's true.  It's not an area.  They're pretty confident, actually.  A few people have said that this is exactly what went down. 
[01:42:30]  They're pretty confident they would have seen something.  Oh, wow.  And, um, and then he, he continues writing or, or, uh, tweeting, amazing the U.S.  can pick up explosions worldwide, but they can't.  So maybe it was a mechanical failure that was a catastrophic, like, maybe the plane door  ripped off.  Like, what would that do if, uh, the doors over the wings ripped, maybe the plane door ripped  off.  But then you got the two guys with the fake passports.  That's true.  So what the hell is that about?  But maybe, if it's, if it's not an explosion, maybe the plane door ripped off and hit, uh, 
[01:43:00]  an engine or something, or, or something ripped off and hit the tail, or maybe the explosion  wasn't big enough to be picked up on, like, maybe, like, say you do a shoe bomb and you  walk into the bathroom behind the cockpit, which is in the first class lounge, and however  those things work, you put it up against the wall right there.  Let's say you blow a, a, a hole through the fuselage, which doesn't register as a giant  explosion where a satellite would pick it up, but the, a piece just gets ripped off, or  it blows into the cockpit, and the piece gets ripped off. 
[01:43:30]  It might not be big enough to be picked up by a satellite.  I'm talking very quickly.  No.  I'm sorry.  I don't know, though.  I'm rambling.  You're trying to figure it out like everyone else, though.  But it could, yeah.  I don't know.  I think, I think they'd nosedive it right into the ocean.  How would they get in the cockpit?  Yeah, that's, that's.  These days, you can't just walk into a fucking cockpit.  You trick them.  You're not a distress call.  You trick them?  Yeah, you knock on the door and say something.  I gotta talk to you.  Oh.  Food delivery.  I'd go with food delivery.  Food delivery.  Pizzas here? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  It'll work.  Land shark.  Land shark, the old jag.  Land shark works.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Checking in.  John.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  I'm sorry.  I would have called in earlier, but I wasn't able to.  And I have a worse white trash limo story than yours, I believe.  No way.  Yes, sir.  My ex-wife and I were dating.  Nice.  We get the group of 12 people in this huge stretch limo.  Nice.  For the most uncomfortable trip, half an hour to medieval times. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, no.  You took a limo to medieval times?  Absolute.  To have some turkey legs and drog?  Yes.  It was fucking horrible.  Yeah.  And, of course, we ended up in divorce, sir.  It was fantastic.  As well you should have.  That's why I write every month.  That's why Ann's story earlier was great, because we all can relate to it.  Oh, God.  Thinking at the time that you're a big shot.  Fuck.  That's terrible. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  More importantly, on line eight, it's Lady Di.  Hi.  How you doing today?  Uh-oh.  By the way, Josh in Boston, I don't have time for you, but he says, I hope you brought  up the stolen passports.  It's a very common thing.  I think that's going to come out eventually.  That is a common thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They needed to go somewhere else.  They needed to go somewhere else.  Wanted to go somewhere else.  Yeah.  Lady Di, were you just crying in front of a Target?  No. 
[01:45:30]  Why the laugh?  No.  Crying in front of a Target.  Were you at any time parked in your car in front of a Target store?  Well, not recently.  No.  When?  A long time ago.  Well, how long?  Like a week or a month or 10 years?  About 10 years ago. 
[01:46:00]  That's it.  To live by a Target.  You talking about the store?  What are you talking about?  You are one for elephant hunters.  Oh, my God.  Are you a Target for elephant hunters?  Yeah.  Yes.  We're talking about the store.  Target.  Yeah.  All right.  You're talking about the store.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I would say when I was living in Westfield, yeah, I used to go to Target.  Yeah, right.  And you sat, you were, uh, you were a late driver.  Maybe you were someone else.  Were you crying recently in your car? 
[01:46:30]  No.  Then that guy might be full of shit.  Maybe he's full of shit.  Or Lady Di is lying.  Or Lady Di.  I don't know if I had a video.  She does have a history of, uh, bullshit.  He's a liar.  Yeah.  Of bullshitting.  Yeah.  Lady Di.  I don't cry in my car.  Why would I cry in the car for?  Where do you cry usually?  Where do I cry usually?  Why do you have to repeat every question?  I always cry.  Why don't you just answer the question?  All right. 
[01:47:00]  Um, sad movies.  Why do I repeat the question?  Sad movies?  What?  Like home movies?  Give us, give us the top five things you cry at.  Um, uh, usually a very good movie.  Okay.  Movies.  Mm-hmm.  What else?  That's one.  Huh?  If I put on a movie, if I put on a movie that I like, I'll, you know, I'll, I'll cry during  the movie or cry at the movie.  We don't need an explanation.  Yeah.  We don't need an explanation.  I want four other things you cry at.  Holy shit. 
[01:47:30]  I'm doing this on purpose.  Four other things I cry.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  This is the repeating of the question again, by the way.  There's something sad.  I usually cry.  Oh, really?  I don't cry.  This is correct.  Are you making this list, Sam?  Yes.  What?  We were looking for the top five things you cry at.  So far, we got movies.  And something sad.  And something sad.  So we need three more.  Three more.  All right.  Um, do I go answering the question?  Ask it a question with a question. 
[01:48:00]  Three more things?  I don't know.  What else?  Uh, I guess I cry at a funeral.  Yeah.  Oh, a funeral.  Funeral.  Okay.  Good.  That's good.  What else?  That doesn't fit into the sad thing.  Kind of playing family feud right now.  Isn't this fun?  Yeah.  Two more.  Two more things.  Yes.  Ah.  Three more.  Oh, boy.  Not finding a job.  I cry about that.  Oh, oh.  Unemployment.  Yeah.  I got one more thing, right?  I got one more thing. 
[01:48:30]  What about an empty case of natty ice?  Oh, yeah.  I definitely cry about that.  Yes.  Yeah.  No, but you can't use that one because Ann came up with that.  One more.  I open the refrigerator and there's no natty ice in there.  I cry about that.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  No.  Yeah.  I go out and get more.  That's all I do.  All right.  One more thing you cry at.  That's the one more thing.  Doesn't count.  No, Ann came up with that.  Don't cry at that.  That was a joke, which is pretty clever, but it's not real.  But what else would I cry at? 
[01:49:00]  Let me see.  What else would you usually...  If you chop an onion, don't you usually cry?  Okay.  That's good.  Say onions.  There you go.  So what's the top five things that Lady Di cries at?  Lady Di cries at a good movie.  A good movie.  Yeah.  Something sad.  Right.  Yeah.  A funeral, not finding a job, and chopping onions.  Okay.  What about the Natty Ice thing?  You forgot about that. 
[01:49:30]  No, we didn't.  Oh, God.  Ann gave you that one.  What about when you have a discharge in your panties?  That makes us cry.  Yeah.  How about you name five good movies?  Oh, five good movies?  That's easy.  All right.  That was easy.  I could just look at the movies that I have, the CDs that I have up there.  Well, La Bamba is a good movie.  La Bamba.  That's a good point.  Coming from the big bopper.  Lady Di. 
[01:50:00]  Lady Di.  Hello, baby.  Lady Di, were you on that plane that just crashed?  No.  Wait, how do you know it crashed?  Oh.  The Malaysian plane.  Someone told me that you were on that plane.  Were you?  No.  I don't fly on airplanes.  What?  Why don't they pick her up?  There's some kind of an operation they do.  Something die dropped. 
[01:50:30]  You've never flown on an airplane, Lady Di?  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.  A long time ago.  Oh, but what?  But I haven't been on an airplane in a long time, so.  Why?  Because if you're flying?  Yeah, you could say that.  Yeah.  But you're not scared of what the alcohol is doing to you every single day.  Right, right.  That's fine.  Which is way worse for you than flying.  That's fine.  You know what?  Let me tell you something right now.  I know I drink, and I do, you know, I drink. 
[01:51:00]  I know that.  But I also eat, you know.  Obviously.  It's called grazing when you do it.  Wait, listen to the logic, though.  So you eat.  So what does that mean?  Yeah.  Well, that absorbs the alcohol.  Oh, you're one of those.  Absorbs the alcohol.  What are you talking about?  Where do you think it goes, then?  Your body has to process the alcohol no matter what.  It doesn't matter what it's in.  Dr. Opie and Anthony, listen to me.  Okay.  Look, you piece of shit.  I don't give a fuck if you drop dead tomorrow. 
[01:51:30]  But facts are facts.  Oh, come on.  Stop justifying that food soaks up your alcoholism.  Soaks it up.  You pig.  No.  Take that advice from Dr. Opie.  Go fuck yourself.  Jesus Christ.  Enough of these pieces of shit.  Do you think if you have, like, bread and the alcohol is absorbed in it, where do you think it then goes?  It's still being digested. 
[01:52:00]  Be careful.  She's going to call you Dr. Anthony for throwing logic at the situation.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  Okay.  I, you know, I didn't mean...  Yes, you are.  Well, why don't you explain yourself?  You're saying the food absorbs your alcohol.  Yeah.  The food absorbs the alcohol.  Yes, it does.  And so that means it's not, you know, wrecking your body?  Yeah.  I never said that.  I never said that.  Oh.  No, really.  I never said that.  And why didn't you say railroad crossings?  Huh? 
[01:52:30]  For the other thing.  Oh, oh.  Why didn't you say trains or railroad crossings?  No.  What about that?  No.  For things that make you cry, I would assume trains and railroad crossings would be on the list.  No.  Why would that make you...  Well, because what happened...  Abandoned children?  No.  Oh.  No.  No.  All right.  We're, we're...  I love everybody.  Trust me.  You're a dud today.  We need four more movies.  Yeah, let's do the movies before we move on. 
[01:53:00]  Good movies.  So far, we got La Bamba.  The Rose?  Remember that one?  The Rose.  Is the Rose again?  Bette Midler.  Sort of a Janis Joplin-y type of a character.  That's a cult movie.  Yes, it is.  All right.  Selena?  See, I'm going down the list.  Selena.  What do you mean, Selena?  Oh, the movie Selena.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Jennifer Lopez.  Oh, my God.  You are...  These are the worst movies I've ever heard. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you like a movie about dead Latin singers?  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah, La Bamba and Selena.  Two more.  Two more.  Rocky II and Rocky V.  What?  Rocky II.  Not even the original.  Rocky II, which is his rematch with Apollo Creed.  Which was a good movie.  It was good, but I mean...  Who was in Rocky V?  I don't know my Rocky numbers.  That was the last one with the guy that died of AIDS. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, with Tommy Morrison?  Yeah.  That was with Tommy Morrison, yeah.  Before he had...  That's one of your top movies?  You didn't like the Clever Lang one?  Rocky III?  What about Rocky?  What about the original Rocky?  Right.  Wouldn't you start with just saying Rocky?  Rocky's on Broadway now.  I'm going to take a limo in, go to the Russian tea room.  The original Rocky was good, okay?  But I'm just saying my favorite ones were Rocky II and Rocky V.  Oh, Rocky V. 
[01:54:30]  Of course they were.  Who says Rocky V?  No one says Rocky V ever.  I love that one.  All right.  Lady Di, have you been offered any casting in any movies recently because of your newfound fame?  No, Sam.  Yeah, congratulations.  It's on the Twitter followers.  Yeah, well, you know, I found out about that yesterday.  What do you mean?  I found...  Somebody congratulated me.  I have over 100,000 people following me. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Followers, whatever you want to call it.  Right.  But I didn't even know that until I found out.  Yeah.  I didn't know that until I found out.  Let's just let that soak in like alcohol into food for a little while.  Now, I didn't know that until I found out.  Well, let's put it on the chalkboard for everyone to see.  Giving you full credit.  Right, please. 
[01:55:30]  Put it on the chalkboard.  Oh, you're a piece of work.  Oh, boy.  But congratulations.  You're hot.  You're hot right now.  How'd you get so many followers?  You're hot.  Oh, I have no idea.  Well, they say you get a lot of followers by tweeting good stuff.  Right.  So you must be tweeting some good stuff right now.  Tweeting what?  You're like, wow.  It's a chore.  It's a chore.  I see why she has so many followers.  Yeah.  It's literally a Twitter feed of all replies. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  Yes, she does that.  Maybe that's the way to get followers these days.  I think so.  Yeah.  I really don't know how I've got so many.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we called you because some guy said they had 30 seconds of video of you crying in a car.  In front of a Target.  I'm starting to think that guy's full of shit.  Well, I don't know.  He must have the wrong person.  Oh.  Because it sure wasn't.  It was not me.  Oh.  Okay.  How's Bill?  I haven't even been by a Target in a long time. 
[01:56:30]  Mm-hmm.  How's Bill?  He's fine.  Okay.  All right, Lady Di.  All right.  We'll let you go.  Get back to Twitter.  How's the job hunt going?  It's okay.  I'm going to go today.  I'm going to go back and do the computer thing with the job.  Where?  Where?  Where are you going today?  I'm going back to Family Dollar.  Stop going to Family Dollar.  They don't want you. 
[01:57:00]  It's the same fucking place.  It's the same answers to the same questions that we've been asking for.  It's got to be close to 10 years now.  Jesus.  No, actually, we have audio from N.E.W., right?  Family Dollar.  All right.  So you're going to go to Family Dollar again today?  Yeah.  And if I can, I'm going to go back to Burger King again.  Why don't you just see if you can get a dollar from every one of your Twitter followers?  Ah, that would be nice.  They need to be rich.  Yeah.  Then you wouldn't need a job.  That's smart.  I'm not going to do that. 
[01:57:30]  I can't do much about your fans.  Let's start a dollar for Lady Dike campaign for the Natty Ices.  How many Natty Ices have you had?  It's nine in the morning.  This is my second one.  Holy fuck, man.  Got to loosen up before the old job month begins.  Go to Family Dollar with fucking beer breath.  She's on two Natty Ices, but just now she goes, I'm going to go to Family Dollar, and then 
[01:58:00]  I'll go to Burger King if I can.  Yeah.  So she can get down two beers, but doesn't know if she can get to two job establishments.  No.  What time did you pass out last night?  I didn't pass out.  I don't pass out.  No?  I don't pass out.  I go to sleep.  Well, we call it passing out.  How many Natty Ices did you have yesterday on a Sunday?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't count.  Wow, yeah.  It was Sunday.  Was it more than 10? 
[01:58:30]  Yes.  Was it more than 20?  No, but maybe 11.  11 Natty Ices.  As she's sitting around.  That sounds rocking.  And what kind of food did you eat to absorb 11 Natty Ices yesterday?  I had my usual.  Like, I like to have eggs and potatoes and stuff like that.  Oh, God.  Her shit.  The worst dumps.  Oh, her dumps must just be viscous.  Natty Ices, eggs, and potatoes. 
[01:59:00]  Ugh.  Imagine what those farts smell like.  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  Bed bugs are just leaving the couch.  Right.  She's just farting into the cushion.  One fart, and you...  Yeah.  They're fucking...  And they're gone.  Yeah.  They're fleeing.  What are your bowel movements like, Lady Di?  Lady Di, do you have nice, firm stools?  Oh, sweet.  No, they look like stew got thrown into a fan.  Oh, my God.  That's what the back of her toilet looks like.  Like, she probably...  Like, if you lift up the seat... 
[01:59:30]  Oh, God.  It looks like a fucking...  It looks like a bottom of her toilet has the measles.  Don't talk like that.  What?  Just give me the studio today.  I'm right here, yes.  Who do you think that was?  No, no, no.  I was just wondering about that, because, you know...  I'm here.  I really didn't hear him talking until now, so...  Yes, I'm here.  Right.  Let's see.  Actually, people are making their own list of what Lady Di cries at.  Oh.  Wreck-Star 19...  Wreck-Star, I don't know, 1936, or T, whatever. 
[02:00:00]  Mirrors.  Oh, mirrors.  Railroad crossings.  Right.  Empty beer bottles.  Mm-hmm.  And the empty feeling in her soul.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Oh, boy.  Hold on, hold on.  You mean empty beer cans.  Right.  You're not...  That's right.  Holy shit.  Sorry that the guy said empty beer bottles when it's cans.  You said the empty feeling in your soul.  Right.  I have to correct you?  No, the beer bottles.  I drink out of cans.  Right, right.  I drink cans. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  That's what she had to correct in that list.  Okay.  Oh, lady, die.  You're a disaster.  You're a disaster.  Would you mind taking a dump on the air for us?  Yes, I would.  No, I wouldn't.  Come on, I wouldn't do that.  Oh.  Please?  No.  I bet they're a mess.  Yeah.  I'll pay for your next six-pack of Natty Ice.  Whoa!  Rock.  Please?  That'll last the whole morning.  It's a bargain.  What? 
[02:01:00]  I said, you're a big spender.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Why?  Oh, come on.  For the show.  For the show.  No, I'm not going to do that for the show.  Oh, show.  Show.  Oh, show.  All right.  Well, good luck with the job search.  Good luck with the Natty Ices today.  Dollar store.  The Twitter fame.  The Twitter fame.  Congratulations on that.  What?  I'm going to go to other stores, too.  You know, I'm not just going to go to one place.  I'm going to go.  Oh, that would be silly. 
[02:01:30]  Whatever.  You know, like, for instance, I still got an application at grocery stores.  Okay?  And I go back there and say, well, are you hiring?  You know, whatever.  And, you know, they usually just say, no, we're fully staffed and stuff like that.  Tell them you'll bag groceries.  How hard is it to get that job?  Well, if it's available, they'll give it to me.  All right.  This is the same conversation we have every time.  Every time.  So we've got to move on, Lady Di.  You're never going to get a job. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, I am.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, okay.  I'm not worried.  I'm not worried.  It keeps me up at night.  Yeah, it makes for good radio when we hear the exact same fucking answers.  All right.  Sometime this week.  Okay?  The week is early yet.  It's Monday.  Sometime this week, I'm going to go to Jersey Gardens Mall and apply over there, too.  How about instead of sometime this week, how about today?  What's wrong with today?  It's 9 o'clock.  You should have been out of the house by now. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, it is 9 o'clock.  Pounding the pavement.  Right.  Into dust.  What happens?  Okay?  What?  We'll see what happens?  That is, it's up to you.  You can't just sit there and say, we'll see what happens.  Well, nothing happens.  What do you mean, you'll see what happens?  It's up to you.  How about you do it today?  Hey, she's treating going for a job the way we treat possible rain.  It could happen, but we'll see.  We'll see. 
[02:03:00]  Okay, guys.  Oh.  Talk to you later, okay?  All right.  We'll talk to you later.  All right.  Nice talking to you.  Thank you for encouragement.  We'll see you in April.  All right?  All right.  Bye-bye.  Okay, bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  What a mess.  Last time she was in here, that schnozzola is just looking like W.C. Fields.  It is really bad.  It's that big fucking, what do they call that?  That booze nose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alcoholism.  Yeah, it's called alcoholism. 
[02:03:30]  No, there's some, a word for it.  What is it called?  They, um.  She put makeup on before she took her.  Gin blossoms.  That's it.  Gin blossoms, you're right.  Is that what that is?  Gin blossoms?  Yeah.  Before she took her blurry Twitter photo, you can see that she put a whole bunch of  makeup on.  Right.  She did slap some makeup on that fucking pinhead.  And then said this picture's good enough.  Yeah.  When you redo the picture, at least.  On her bed bug sofa.  Yeah, there's a shit.  She looks like Jerry Lewis after the fucking steroid shot.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  With the fat head.  Fat head.  She is a lunk head.  She should have a clock in her stomach in that picture.  Big giant Buddhist skull.  Fucking retarded person hairdo.  There's no body to her hair at all.  No.  It's just that greasy, stringy, yuck.  Lifeless hair.  Like a doll's hair.  Black hair.  Let's drink to your lack of bounce.  Let's drink to my lack of bounce.  I'll never use Breck again. 
[02:04:30]  Amazing.  All right.  Well, there's your Lady Di update.  Start with that guy calling up, which I guess he's full of shit, right?  Yeah, he's probably full of shit then.  But why would...  The old old lady Di could be a line sack.  But why would he be full of shit if the last time he saw her was true?  I don't know.  Maybe he wants to keep that whole thing going for his fame?  He might have thought it was her.  I don't fucking know.  I would have liked to have seen it.  I don't tell you that much.  Absolutely. 
[02:05:00]  Man, they are trying to figure out this plane thing.  Search intense.  Every channel has something on it.  Perplexed.  Chasing all angles and missing plain mystery.  That ocean's a big fucking place.  I got a tweet from somebody who said a lot of the Dreamliners, the new 787s, which are  Boeing, have found hairline cracks.  Wind cracks.  Yeah.  Before they're even released.  So maybe it was...  Imagine if a piece of the wing or something just...  Even though it never happened.  It never happens until it does.  And maybe one faulty part...  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  Gets ripped off and that's why they try to turn around and they go right down without  an explosion.  I don't know.  A little piece of that wing comes off.  You're dead.  Could speculate, speculate.  But they haven't found anything.  The ocean's huge, though.  The whole fucking ocean is goddamn huge.  There is...  Somebody tweeted something.  He said, check out Air Disaster's episode Behind Closed Doors.  I saw that one.  Okay, what happens when a plane explosively decompresses.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  It's not good. 
[02:06:00]  That means it decompresses very quickly.  Like from air getting sucked out?  Yeah.  It'll suck everything out.  It sucked out like the cargo...  The cargo door blew off is what happened in that case.  It was a faulty fucking latch on it that actually showed that it was latched when it really wasn't  fully latched.  And some of the seats came out.  Wow.  Like it blew out and fucking sucked some of the people in seats right out of the hole  in the bottom.  And then it was one of those planes with the engine in the back. 
[02:06:30]  Was it a DC-10?  The 1A engine.  Yeah, something like that.  An L-1011 or something.  It just fucking broke all the hydraulic lines.  And they had a hard time trying to fly the plane.  Breaking news.  Oil slicks found or not connected to plane, they're now saying.  Wow.  Okay.  So they don't know where the fuck this thing was.  I just had two giant oil slicks.  Yeah.  In the middle of the ocean for something.  Yeah.  Maybe it landed somewhere and they just had a...  The lady die was swimming.  Maybe it landed somewhere and they're all just enjoying a nice day. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Having lunch.  Oh, that was the crash too.  The one that they're showing on Air Disasters.  The guy was talking about.  A fucking...  There was a coffin with a body in it that they were transporting that just fell into somebody's  yard.  Oh, really?  So you come out and you look in your backyard and there's just a coffin with a body in it.  How weird is that?  What happened?  A piece of it got sucked out or something on this one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The cargo door.  And then they fucking...  Like a few years later, the same thing happened again because they didn't do anything about 
[02:07:30]  the door.  It was really some negligence.  Did the plane crash or did they land?  In one case, they landed.  In another, they crashed.  I would hate to get sucked out of a plane.  You'd still be alive.  But you never know.  You might bang your head.  Who the fuck...  A violent yanking like that.  And who knows if you go out and you're smashing your head on something.  Yeah.  This guy's going to explain everything.  His name is Matt in Arizona.  Hey, Sully, you're on the...  You should be on the news, Matt.  Hello, Matt.  I just wanted to know why you guys aren't talking about the fact that there weren't any radio 
[02:08:00]  calls from the pilots.  It's just power.  We did mention that.  Yeah.  That's kind of...  We said there was nothing.  That's strange, too.  Yeah, it was very, very sudden.  Matt has to be very quick, then.  Maybe the pilot just had it with his life.  If the co-pilot probably had something...  It's fine with the co-pilot.  You've got to say.  You know, you'd think that if they...  If it was a catastrophic, you know, mechanical failure or something like that, they've still  got time to drop from 36,000 feet to call the tower and say we're going down to get 
[02:08:30]  some type of location on them, not just pop off the radar and just disappear.  You know, I've got to ask Neil deGrasse Tyson about that.  Maybe it was Gremlins, Doc.  Imagine if they're showing now or watching as we talk to you, Sully.  I don't need to watch this shit.  A plane going down.  And it's actually pretty well shot.  Like, the plane is nosediving and they're showing a hole in the back.  Yeah.  And you can see the people hanging on to their seats, like, looking back at the hole.  These poor bastards are trying to, like... 
[02:09:00]  Trying to lift that fucking...  Fly their plane.  Trying to lift it up and ride it.  You think that raises your heart rate a bit?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  The graphics are very good on this show.  This is really good.  They do really good computer animations.  And now they're showing the plane right into...  It's diving into the trees or whatever and they're trying to pull it up.  I don't think they're pulling it up in time.  No, it doesn't look good.  Unless they can fucking flatten it out and land something.  Nya, nya, nya, nya.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Not good. 
[02:09:30]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, boy.  So, it is strange in this day and age that it's still a mystery.  Yeah.  Three days later, it's still a mystery.  They just can't figure this one out.  How can they not have the black box automatically go somewhere?  That's what they were talking about all weekend.  Automatically go somewhere.  No, no, no.  They actually said that.  Now, why do you have to find the black box in this day and age when that shit should  just be...  On a cloud.  ...at a central station or whatever?  Yeah, and then, you know, you store it or whatever, and then after a certain amount, 
[02:10:00]  after a year, you get rid of it.  If there's no problems...  That's amazing.  ...that would indicate that...  They said that's just antiquated, you know, technology.  It's kind of stupid they still have it that way.  It should be, like, yeah, captured by some kind of a cloud device.  I bet Alex Jones knows what happened.  Well, it's obviously...  A false flag.  ...the government was involved.  A false flag operation.  A false flag operation.  A false flag.  It's like the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  Planes don't just disappear. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, planes don't just disappear.  Obviously, this is like 9-11 when the plane went to Cleveland, and they offloaded all the  passengers who now still are, like, just missing.  You should ask Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Could be Bigfoot or Aliens.  That, too.  Voss is all about, you know, mysteries and disappearing planes and trains.  Loch Ness Monster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, this is... 
[02:11:00]  Hey, this is...  This is Planey McDisappear.  I'm trying to get a flight on Malaysian Air.  Can I get that?  Oh, Todd, this is no time to make jokes about that.  No, I'm just doing a phone scam.  Oh, you got him.  Gotcha.  All right.  I was wondering.  Good choice, Travis. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, it is.  A good movie.  According to Lady Di.  Yeah.  It's Shaney with a Band-Aid on his head.  Wow.  When old people have to wear Band-Aids on their bald heads.  God, is that just fucking...  It's over, Johnny.  It's just sad, right?  It's just over.  Very shortly, once you got the Band-Aid on your bald head for something. 
[02:12:00]  I fell down.  Yeah.  I hit my head this morning.  But I'm okay.  I'm fine.  I hit my life call alert.  That's not for me.  That's for some old person.  Really?  The old lady.  Shut up.  Sarah Palin's killing it at CPAC, I hear.  Is she?  Yeah, it's a big headline.  Yeah?  She reads Dr. Seuss.  Green eggs and ham, is it?  Something tells me this is going to be real embarrassing.  And what?  She's making it her own? 
[02:12:30]  Real embarrassing.  Yeah.  And people are saying she's killing it?  I bet she bashes the Democrats.  I bet she does.  I bet she takes a little shot at Obama.  And jabs.  Oh, yeah.  Where are the jabs?  Jabs!  Let's listen a little to this.  It's 80 minutes long.  Perfect.  Ted Cruz.  He's got a clever way of doing it, too.  Ugh, I hate her.  Dr. Seuss.  Who'd have thunk? 
[02:13:00]  Who'd have thunk?  Would you fuck her?  Yeah.  That goofy hair.  Maybe I'll just ad-lib something.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Okay.  But there he was, reading it on the floor of the Senate,  and through airwaves, he was telling his kids,  I'm thinking of you.  Oh, God.  I can't stand that voice.  And I have five kids.  I have five kids.  So reading it, I'm over all those kids. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.  Totally have a memory by the time,  especially by the time Trig was born.  So I had to spice it up a bit.  And little Trig, fluffy little fella,  his bedtime story,  now it goes something like that.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  What a setup.  I do not like this, Uncle Sam.  I do not like his health care scam.  Oh.  I do not like... 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I am douching out here.  What?  Fuck yeah.  This is your girl.  This is hot.  This is my girl.  This is your girl.  Everyone knows.  My girl.  She's beautiful.  She's taking shots at Obama.  You should love this.  Oh, just you wait.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I do not like these dirty crooks  or how they lie and cook the books. 
[02:14:30]  I do not like when Congress steals.  I do not like their crony dills.  Dills?  I do not like this spying, man.  I do not like...  Oh, yes, we can.  What is she doing?  She was almost vice president of the United States.  Shit.  Fucking dunce.  I do not like this spending spree.  We're smart.  We know there's nothing free. 
[02:15:00]  I do not like reporter smug replies  when I complain about their lies.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I do not like this kind of hope.  And we won't take it.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Boo!  Be more funny. 
[02:15:30]  This is going great.  Boo!  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  So, is it this right?  Fuck, is that douchey?  I hate her hair?  I hate her hair.  Oh.  Oh.  And she's such an amazing, she's a really good speaker, and she's got a tremendous poise  on camera when she's like, but too bad that she's just such an asshole.  I do not like this.  I do not like this.  I do not like this, Dill.  I do not like this, Dill. 
[02:16:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Isn't this great?  I'm so happy that caught on.  Isn't this great?  I love that guy.  Oh.  Uh, well, people saying she killed it, so there you go.  Yeah, huh?  Well, you're, uh, you're channeled there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They said she killed it.  Yeah, that she nailed it?  Yeah, she nailed it.  Is that what they're saying?  They're saying it.  MSNBC is saying she had a terrible time.  Of course.  Yeah, they're laughing at her, not with her. 
[02:16:30]  I gotta, I think it's, I think it's aliens with this plane thing.  Oh, you think, what, you think aliens took it?  That'll change the whole game.  Don't you think that would change the whole game on Earth?  I don't think a lot of people would go flying anymore.  They could just be grabbed out of the air by a UFO.  You would never see your Nana again.  Oh, fuck that, man.  Yeah, you think the aliens, uh.  Would that be a game changer, you think?  Oh. 
[02:17:00]  We would probably start getting along better with each other.  Everyone just, like if you're flying, everyone's just looking out the windows.  Looking up like what?  Just waiting for a predator to come down and get you.  Imagine.  Oh, man.  Right now, they're just somewhere in a big, huge spaceship.  Spaceship.  The plane's just sitting in a hangar on a giant spaceship.  People like, ooh, we don't know what to do.  Life as we know it would certainly change.  Yeah.  Yeah, we could prove that it was aliens that took this plane. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Would you ever sleep again?  Oh, that would be rough.  Oh, man.  I'd be thinking about that all the time.  And it's so strange that this thing is just gone, and they just can't figure it out.  That ocean's crazy, though.  You can't.  Once something fucking falls in the water like that, it takes a long time to find something.  Yeah.  And I think it was only over water for a very short period of time, so the whole flight.  But that also leads you to believe it was terrorism, because they love doing shit like that, like blowing it up over water. 
[02:18:00]  Yep.  But why isn't anyone coming forward?  Why do it if you don't come forward?  I don't know.  I think it was a dry run.  Maybe they have issues with them, but I really think it was to test something.  Scary shit right there, yo.  Who knows?  The person on the plane may not have even been the one who did, you know, who knows?  It could have been baggage handlers or anybody who has access to the plane. 
[02:18:30]  Yep.  Let's say hi to Steve in Brooklyn.  Yes.  Steve.  Boo.  Steve.  Hey.  Hey, yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Long time listener.  Best time caller.  I just wanted to give Jimmy shit about, he said she was almost vice president.  I mean, I don't really agree with her, but have you looked at our vice president?  I like Biden.  I have a lot.  Even though he says some dumb stuff or he kind of flies off the cuff when he talks, I have 
[02:19:00]  much more faith in his ability than I do in hers.  And he's a seasoned politician.  He's been around forever.  Yeah, but that's the whole point, though.  He's been around forever, and he talks out of his ass like 90% of the time.  Don't they all, though, Steve?  Yeah, he does say some dumb shit.  Don't they all?  He is an asshole.  No, yeah, they all do.  But, I mean, when you see...  I think Sarah Palin is way worse than Biden, period.  But Sarah Palin, you can at least give, like, credit in the fact that she's only been for, 
[02:19:30]  like, a certain amount of time in politics, and she wasn't, like, on a national stage.  Well, you're right, but she was governor of Alaska for a while.  It's one of the worst...  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  So I say it's one of the worst blunders ever by a political party.  She was terrible.  Yeah.  She just fell apart with basic questions.  They just needed two tits and a pussy on the ticket.  That's it.  McCain sucked.  Like, McCain was horrible.  And if you look at the...  They showed, I think it was the second game change book, or... 
[02:20:00]  I forget what the name of it.  The HBO show?  The movie?  No, no, no, no.  It was the second book that was off the up.  It was a sequel to the first book.  Oh, my God.  But they pretty much pointed out how polling showed that his numbers increased because of her.  Because his big thing was conservatives didn't like them.  I understand that.  People didn't like...  That was where that fucking nonsense poll came from.  She's helping his numbers because he's a moderate, and the arch-religious conservatives don't like them. 
[02:20:30]  So, fuck them.  They would have voted for John McCain over Barack Obama, no matter who his vice president was.  So the stupid Republicans allowing this arch-absolute conservative to be involved in the ticket like that.  When people were so tired of George Bush, they were dumb, and they miscalculated.  McCain was the only guy with a shot in the Republican Party to get elected because he was seen as a moderate guy and his war record. 
[02:21:00]  And there was something about him.  Like, you know, he kind of agreed with liberals on torture and a lot of things.  He was the only one with a fucking shot, and they blew it by putting that asshole in.  But to be honest, if he would have been elected anyway, it would have been the same thing, except, like, Republicans would have turned against Obama instead.  They wouldn't have even turned against McCain.  Well, maybe, but...  Maybe.  I don't know, buddy.  But I think there was a better choice for vice president.  You know, I just don't think she was the right choice.  I think she came apart.  Like, in the Katie Couric interview, the more I learned about that, like, Katie Couric, it wasn't this brutal interview. 
[02:21:30]  And the fact that Sarah Palin couldn't come up with periodicals she read, I know that that's just a momentary flub.  But that's a politician trying to think on their feet.  Or she had to read off the palm of her hand that time in that interview.  It's like, if that's the way you think on your feet, how can you handle any crisis if you have that inability to handle the pressure of an interview?  That's true, also.  I mean, but, like, if you had, like, Gates' book where he mentioned how Biden was wrong on every single issue he ever had in front of him. 
[02:22:00]  Granted, he didn't have nice things to say about Palin, either.  Right.  But, you know.  I'm not saying Biden's the greatest, but...  The comment itself was funny to me, just because, like, every time I see the vice president, it's just...  I don't think Sarah Palin would have been better, that's for sure.  Biden's a dope, and he's a career politician.  She would have been hotter.  Well, she would have been more fun, I guess, but...  Yeah.  When is the vice president got in respect, though?  Like, remember, like, when George Bush Sr. was Reagan's VP, he was known as a coward.  Yeah.  People said he had no backbone, he was not a man, he was a coward. 
[02:22:30]  Dan Quayle, blithering idiot.  Oh, yeah.  Al Gore, I mean, he didn't have his bad reputation, but he was a bore.  Yeah.  That was the worst kid, they called him a bore.  Probably fucking LBJ.  Dick Cheney was evil and terrible.  But, like, the vice president, I think a lot of times, he just takes a lot of...  He's a real barrier for the president sometimes.  And now Biden's an idiot.  Like, there's always some shit the vice president takes.  Frank Underwood.  House of Cards. 
[02:23:00]  I don't watch House of Cards.  It's great.  I hear it's great.  It's fucking crazy.  I was too detective.  I didn't see it last night.  I'm one episode behind.  I heard it crashed HBO Go.  Mm-hmm.  Damn.  That's a lot of people trying to watch that shit.  So, you're so pissed.  Damn, what?  People are so pissed, there's a finale.  Yeah, we're a little pissed.  Oh, is that the finale?  Yeah, and they couldn't load the episode.  Oh, man.  Well, I could tell him what happened.  Should we just tell him what happened, then?  Oh, boy.  No.  What?  They wouldn't do that.  They wouldn't do that. 
[02:23:30]  Jimmy, you have your head stuck up your ass.  Well, let's say why.  Oh, shit.  True.  Jimmy.  No, literally.  Why are they defending Sarah Palin, of all people?  Oh, boy.  Because I'll tell you what.  Because she's hot?  No, because people...  Because you have some fucking obsession with fucking your teacher?  No, it's a...  It's about political ideology.  No, I understand.  People defend their ideology no matter what the person is.  Blindly, that's one of the problems in this country.  Go ahead, Ron.  Yeah, well, the whole thing here, and I'm not a big Sarah Palin fan, but you're talking 
[02:24:00]  about Sarah Palin not acting and coming back quickly in interviews.  You've got Obama who doesn't say anything without a teleprompter.  I thought you see some inconsistency there with your comments.  Hold on, hold on.  I'll go.  I'll go.  I'll talk to you.  I think that they all use teleprompters.  I never faulted a politician.  First of all, dude, you know this as well as I do.  They don't even write their own speeches.  And I mean, this is none of them.  Obama, Bush.  They all have speech writers, and they all use teleprompters. 
[02:24:30]  I'm not faulting someone for using a teleprompter.  You're not faulting someone for using a teleprompter, but she didn't use a teleprompter, and she  got slammed.  Because, I mean, it's okay if Obama has the questions beforehand, but when she gets a  question that she doesn't know, which is on some ridiculous subject that nobody gives  the fuck about, but do you see how...  Meanwhile, you got Biden.  Biden's a friggin' idiot.  You see how you automatically...  Like, I'm talking about...  What do you want this guy to figure on the button of a nuclear weapon? 
[02:25:00]  Ugh, dude.  It's a clown.  Dude, the bottom line is this.  I'm not a Republican.  How many times...  You can't talk to people.  This is why we don't like taking calls like this.  Because, like, you say something, and I'm going to say something, and you're just blathering  on.  Go, go, go.  That's what I was trying to do, and then you kept talking.  The teleprompter thing...  What's that, sir?  Here's why that means something.  Because in a debate, they don't have teleprompters.  When they're all standing up there, they may have talking points, but when you're doing 
[02:25:30]  a live debate, they don't all have teleprompters there.  So there are times where they have to kind of come off the cuff.  You're making it a political thing.  I'm saying, I don't like her.  So what does Obama have to do with her?  They're different people.  I'm not talking about ideologically, I hate her.  No, by saying you don't like her, you obviously love Obama.  Yeah, that's why...  That's exactly...  That's how most of this country thinks.  Yeah.  She stinks.  Why can't you just say you don't like Sarah Palin without it meaning there's something  deeper there? 
[02:26:00]  I'm not a fan of Sarah Palin, but I don't like Obama.  I don't like Obama, and I don't like Sarah Palin.  Period.  I don't like you, I don't like Ron Paul.  Sarah Palin comes across like a dumb broad.  Yeah.  Yeah, both of them are pretty bad.  She blew it.  That's the fast state of politics that we have in this country where we have...  But why is Jimmy's head stuck up his ass?  I don't think he's saying anything crazy here.  Yeah, what am I saying that's so crazy?  His head is stuck up his ass because he's saying he loves Biden.  Biden is better than...  I don't think Jimmy said he loved Biden.  You're either mishearing it or you're lying. 
[02:26:30]  You're either mishearing it or you're lying.  This is why, by the way, the fact that you just babble over everybody is why you probably  didn't hear it.  I never said I loved Biden.  One morning, you talk and make your statements.  I'm trying to make a statement in 30 seconds.  Yeah, but you're not going to do it because we're just going to cut you off.  You just keep babbling.  I disagree with you.  I bet this guy didn't even drink beer in high school.  Oh my God, what a dope.  Yeah, he didn't do this.  I bet he didn't rip fucking bong heads or nothing cool.  He didn't rip bong heads before class.  Nothing cool.  No way.  You're saying I said something I didn't say.  So either you're lying or you're just a dumb motherfucker. 
[02:27:00]  Jimmy, you're making misstatements of truth here.  Basically, what...  Did I say I love Biden?  Hold on, hold on.  One thing at a time.  Did I say I love Biden?  You just said I love Biden.  You just said I said I love Biden.  You're lying.  You're lying.  You said I loved Biden.  Did I say I love Biden?  We're splitting hairs here.  No, we're not.  No, we're not.  You're misquoting me.  Not at all.  This is a broad stroke.  You're misquoting me.  You're basically lying and putting words in Jimmy's mouth. 
[02:27:30]  He absolutely did not say that he loves Biden.  Somebody else raised Biden.  I didn't even raise Biden.  Somebody called and mentioned Biden because I had mentioned Sarah Palin, so they're doing  the same thing you do.  And then you said you loved Biden, Jimmy.  Oh, that's right.  I did say that.  You're right.  Go ahead.  Continue rambling, sir.  Thank you, Anthony, for pointing that out.  Basically, what you're saying is, again, Sarah Palin loves Biden better.  See how annoying that is?  Oh, shit. 
[02:28:00]  That's great.  That's right.  It's not worth my time to argue politics with anyone.  No one listens.  They're just waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk.  No one listens.  No one learns anything from either side.  No.  That guy's still probably talking.  He doesn't even know he's been hung up on.  He's still talking.  No, he's still babbling.  Into his cell phone.  Rambling on.  He thinks he's a real head of steam.  So what do you think?  You're just going to talk, Sarah?  We're just going to shut up and listen to you for 20 minutes?  But I think if you listen to this show enough, we've taken shots at all the big players in politics. 
[02:28:30]  So if we take a shot at Sarah Palin today, it doesn't mean we're Obama lovers.  Yeah.  Like, I don't understand that.  We're Obama lover.  Why you can't take shots at your own party, even.  Yeah.  No, you're not allowed to.  It's amazing.  It's so weird to me.  Yeah, because there are plenty of Republicans.  I just, I bet I can't stand them.  And then it's like, oh, what are you, a liberal?  No.  Right.  You're allowed to not like people in your own political affiliation. 
[02:29:00]  People are so stupid.  They're dummies.  Somebody tweeted that Ron Paul supporters are irritating assholes.  Some of them are.  But I like Ron Paul a lot more than I like any of them.  Did you say Ron or Ron?  Rand annoys me.  I mean Rand.  Even though he's probably very similar to us, there's something about Rand that strikes me as headline-grabbing and phony.  Even though I know people go, no, he's a good friend.  Fine.  But I'm just telling you my opinion of him.  I like Ron Paul a lot, though. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  Why don't you vote for him, then?  Yeah, because I don't.  Well, then you don't have a right to say anything.  Yes, yes, I do.  No, you don't.  You're making your statement.  No, you don't.  But, yeah, that's stupid, too, because aren't you making your statement by not voting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doesn't that kind of show you're unhappy with the system in place?  Then write in something.  Who?  I don't know.  It's useless.  It's all useless.  I don't know why I vote in New York.  For the president, anyway. 
[02:30:00]  I don't know why I even bother.  It's not going to do anything.  Democrats are always going to own New York.  Oh, God, yeah.  There's a couple of fucking states.  There's a couple of districts in a couple of states that decide who the fucking president is.  Isn't that amazing?  And that's ridiculous.  That seems a little strange, too.  It's fucking ridiculous.  They've got to control it a little bit.  Yeah.  They don't want the people to have too much power, even though it's the power of the people.  I do like the idea.  I forgot how they figured it out, but to use both the popular vote and the electoral college 
[02:30:30]  as a way to pick the president.  Whatever.  Because it's just fucked.  Yeah.  Investigators perplexed, chasing all angles and missing plain mystery.  Yeah, this one's a weird one.  They're not being casual about it because they're over the oceans.  Yeah.  They're like, what the fuck?  We should have known something here.  If you look down there, that's the New York World's Fair. 
[02:31:00]  Remember that Twilight Zone?  Yeah.  And then they saw dinosaurs?  Yeah.  Little claymation dinosaurs.  I want to ask Jim why he supports Ron Paul.  Okay.  That's Mike in Buffalo.  Hi, Mike.  Hold on a minute.  Let's go, Mikey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Why do you support Ron Paul, buddy?  I will say I support him in comparison with the other two parties.  One reason is I think that I like the fact that he feels different.  Like, he feels like an ideological mix, which, because you have really, like, he's a religious 
[02:31:30]  conservative as far as gays are concerned and abortion, and I totally disagree with him.  Yeah.  But I like the fact that he has all these really weird, this weird variety of support, and I  just feel like in a debate he will talk about anything and he will address anything, and I  think he understands the finances of the country pretty well.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  One more thing.  I love the way he looks at the rest of the world, and we should stop it and mind our own  fucking business.  That's the big reason I like him. 
[02:32:00]  He wants us to mind our business.  I completely agree with you, but that's exactly why he will never get elected.  I realize he just retired, but because he's so based on the Constitution, which I completely  agree with, he, people think he's crazy because of how much he goes based by the Constitution.  You know who I like?  The wrong kind.  Ron kind.  What happened to Ron?  Remember Ron kind?  Ron kind rule.  He's the wrong kind. 
[02:32:30]  Who is the guy?  Who is the candidate?  Oh, that was against him?  Do we have those?  Ron kind?  We haven't played those in a while.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Remember Paul R. Nelson?  Can we get those?  We haven't played those in a while.  He ruled.  Didn't we get them on our show?  Yes, we did.  Paul R. Nelson.  We officially backed him.  Yes, we did.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  The funniest thing about you guys with Paul R. Nelson was you guys goofed on him.  Yep. 
[02:33:00]  And Uncle Paul called him and said he'd be cracking up.  Oh, wow.  Really?  That's not nice.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember that.  Ah, whatever.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Is that the one, Sam?  They tried to make him evil.  We got one?  Yeah, Ron kind.  Yeah, the wrong kind.  10 years ago, liberal lawyer Ron kind was elected to Congress, and he's done almost nothing  in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing, because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. 
[02:33:30]  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public building.  Good.  Ron kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage, and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual  leaders, he even voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag.  He voted for that.  For Congress, Ron kind is the wrong guy.  That music's killer.  The right kind of congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, nice.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports Wisconsin values. 
[02:34:00]  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration, to end our dependence on foreign  oil, to win the war on terror, and to defend traditional marriage.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I approve of this.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  But that's not the one with the electrodes on the penises or something.  No, that was a good one.  Where's that one?  I like the music with the wrong kind.  And then it's like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, nice.  Flowery sunshine music.  Yes. 
[02:34:30]  He didn't want the gays to get married?  No.  Paul R. Nelson, he doesn't like those kind of people.  That's wrong kind.  Ron kind's cup of tea.  Oh, this is the Megabix.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now. 
[02:35:00]  Right about now.  Right about now.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Thank God almighty.  Paul R. Nelson.  That was a great song.  Yeah.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  It fits so perfectly  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Paul R. Nelson  That is a fucking great remix, man 
[02:35:30]  I want the commercial, though, with the electrodes  Yes, electrodes  I have the audio  Wasn't it the Aleuskin or the Aleuskin  Lesbians or mating habits  Or some weird shit  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I got ruled  Yeah, Sam can't find the video  I've got the audio  Oh yeah, we don't need the video  Travis got it, here  With our servicemen and women 
[02:36:00]  Facing death every day  What kind of congressman would try to gut military spending?  The wrong kind  That's right, congressman Ron Kind  Is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops  Of the funding they need to fight for us  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money  He would just rather spend it on sex  That's right  Instead of spending money on cancer research  Ron Kind voted to spend your money  To study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes  Instead of spending money to study heart disease  Ron Kind spent your money 
[02:36:30]  To study the masturbation habits of old men  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars  To study something called  The bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos  Whoever they are  Ron Kind used to pay teenage girls  To watch pornographic movies  With probes connected to their genitalia  Ron Kind pays for sex  But not for soldiers  If Ron Kind had better priorities  You wouldn't be having to hear this  Ron Kind is out of touch  And soon he'll be out of congress  I'm Paul R. Nelson  And I approve of this message 
[02:37:00]  And I approve of this message  By the way, Ron Kind won by a landslide  Yes, he did  With his genital electrodes  I think it was the teenage girls  Teenage girls  But this is why they're all scumbags  I know  Somewhere in a bill  There was some weird research thing  Right, right  And they make it sound like  Oh, you know  He was campaigning for this  I'm sure it was  There was money  Studying the masturbation habits of old men  Yeah  Like that was an actual bill  Or was that  I'm sure it was something  That was in a bill 
[02:37:30]  That said like  This amount of money  Will be allocated for studies  And grants  Let's say  Right  And then  Oh, not  Right  Just overall  Oh, wow  And then it got distributed  Right  To certain organizations  That did those studies  Right  But wrong kind  Ron Kind didn't  He didn't say like  Ah, give money to the sex  Teenage girl genital electrode  Fuck the soldier  Put a battery on her clip  Yeah  There's a bill about  Vietnamese prostitutes  Really?  Wrong kind 
[02:38:00]  And there's the wrong kind  Standing up going  God damn  We gotta pass this  Come on  Clip it on  On her nipples  Oh, they're sneaky fuckers  They are sneaky  And then that one  He voted for a bill  To allow illegal aliens  To burn an American flag  Right  It was probably a bill  You know  A freedom of speech bill  Sure  First amendment  Sure  Right  Right  To burn the flag  Right  And then you throw in  Well  Then they have the right  To burn it too  Right  They just make it sound  A lot worse than it is  And enough people  Buy into it though 
[02:38:30]  Yes they do  Although not in this election  Like we said  He won by a landslide  Over our pal  65% of the vote  65% of the vote  From our pal  Paul R. Nelson  Right about now  Still in office  What?  Wrong kind?  Wrong kind?  Mm-hmm  Holy shit  Yeah, he won again in 2008  People are stupid  2010 and 2012  2012?  There was another election?  How did we miss that one?  I don't know  We should have been right on top of that  That would have been fun  And I can't find anything  I want Paul R. Nelson  What's Paul R. Nelson doing?  Just a family man 
[02:39:00]  What is he doing man?  No idea  I can't find anything  What?  You type in Paul R. Nelson  Into Google  It's all Opie and Anthony  That's terrible  Imagine being a politician  And that's what comes up  When you're Googled  That's the worst thing ever  That's great  Love it  One for the knuckleheads  Yes  Let me say hi to Sean in Brooklyn  Uh, Seany  What's up?  Hey  You guys are killing me  That line when  The general commercial  Whatever the fuck it was  I spit my coffee all over my leg 
[02:39:30]  I love Paul R. Nelson  Yeah  Was it the electrodes  To the teenage girls?  Yeah  I'm fucking sitting there  Listening to it  Right next to some  Dummy on Flappish Avenue  I spit my coffee all over  Right on, bro  You guys are the best  Have a great night  Thank you, Sean  Good night  What the hell  What time is it?  Did we miss out on something?  Daylight savings  Did the aliens get us too?  Spring ahead 12 hours?  Yeah, what eds?  What the fuck?  I am Paul R. Nelson  Um, we'll do the water essay 
[02:40:00]  After the break  We're gonna end with the water essay  Oh, right  School teacher shows  Sex tape of herself  To middle school class  By mistake  Whoopsie  Had that happen  Fired so fired though, right?  Oh, God  Gotta be fired  You gotta be fired  In Arkansas  Middle school teacher  Has apologized  After accidentally  Showing her pupils  A homemade sex tape  What happened?  The explicit video  Showed the female teacher  Performing sex acts  In quotations  Oh, such  What do you think that?  A little hobbin?  Sucking dick  A little hobbin, you think? 
[02:40:30]  Fuck, is that awesome  Sex acts  She looked any good?  That's why she should get fired  Because if  If they were able to see  Sex acts  Yeah  Wouldn't you be turning  That off immediately?  Oh, yeah  She said the steamy video  Had got mixed up  With her lesson notes  How did that happen?  The school has launched  An investigation  Oh, yeah  That's just to see  If anyone else was involved  That old gag  Yeah  My son  Says she was performing 
[02:41:00]  Sex acts  So they talked to a father  The father goes  My son says  She was performing  Sex acts  My heart goes out  Not only to my son  But other kids  In the classroom  Like, the fuck  How old are they?  Middle school is like  Yeah, you're fine  By that age  Stop  My heart goes out  You could look at  Middle school is what?  Imagine seeing one of your teachers  Fucking giving head  Like that  It would be hilarious  I wouldn't love that  Although  The father wants an apology 
[02:41:30]  And for something to be done  Shut up  Is this the news report?  Sam?  What a pussy that father is  Let's handle how  Let's see how they do the news report  That audio  There's a problem  Can we boost the audio  On that damn computer  Somehow  Yeah, let's do that  We've had a bad day  With low audio today  There's nothing we can do  On the computer itself  Or something  I can't crank this shit 
[02:42:00]  More over here  Right about now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  That's how I felt  During the Pete Townshend story  Oh, did you crank it up a little?  Oh, gotcha  Jesus  Did you crank?  Let's see  You cranked  Let's see  It's better  Well, Bob  School leaders say  They are investigating what happened  They are not telling us  Exactly what actions were on the video  But they do tell us  The teacher admitted to playing  Inappropriate material  By mistake in class  That has one parent  Of a 7th grader upset 
[02:42:30]  7th grade is 13, right?  Of herself were incorporated  With classwork  Nicholas Tarlison says Wednesday  His son came home  From Forest Heights Middle School  Saying he saw  A 7th grade in class  My concern is with  Him being in that environment  And the video shows  His son's teacher  She was performing  6 acts  Little Rock school leaders  Say the teacher 
[02:43:00]  At Nick  She showed an inappropriate video  In class  Because it got mixed up  In her lesson plans  But they strongly tell us  It was a mistake  And certainly not planned  This guy's terrible  Tallerson says  The teacher actually called him  After school  To tell him what happened  She sounded apologetic  When she called  She did  She did  Which she should have  The father says  He has sympathy for the teacher  Because she admitted  It was a mistake  This is a boring story  But he also wants accountability  My heart goes out to 
[02:43:30]  Not only my son  He's going to be alright  He's going to be alright  13  Jesus relax  My dick  Tallerson says he had concerns  The district is sweeping  This issue away  And I took that issue to leaders  This guy can't speak  They are taking the proper  Disciplinary steps  To make sure  The teacher is held accountable  And to prevent this from happening  He's trying so hard  Not to have a dialect  He is tripping over his own tongue  Is that like the guy  That swallowed the bug? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, yeah  Exactly  He went all ghetto?  Wow, was he trying hard  Well, more power to you  You couldn't keep that in anymore?  No  What a boring story, man  That sucked  I mean, the 13-year-old boy  Is going to be just fine  He's probably laughing his ass off  With his friends  Talking with his little buddies  About it  Going, holy man  Did you see that?  Right?  Yeah  I don't think you're horrified  By any of that stuff  At that age especially  At that age  That's all you're thinking about  I'm trying to think what age  Anything over like 11  I would say  When you don't understand it 
[02:44:30]  Then it would be a little scary  But not  If you don't know what's going on  But  7th grade is like 12, 13, right?  You know what's going on  Well  You know what time it is  15 or 16  Doesn't that tell you too  If you're going to make a sex tape  Do something before the sex  Lead up to it  So if you ever put it on accidentally  Oh, right  You know that like  You and your husband  Should be playing Pictionary  And you know right after  Right  If you're shit in his mouth  Yes  Make sure you  Show something first  Get it off if you see Pictionary  Yes  This is a very good question  Coming in from North Carolina 
[02:45:00]  Chris, go ahead  Chris, go  Yeah, Opie  You reckon when that boy  Was talking to his dad  About seeing the woman  Performing a sex act  You reckon he just went  And tried to climb a tree  After his dad  Tried to talk to him about it  All right  All right  You did  I wasn't watching sex  Yeah  You know  It was the famous film  In grammar school  I was in 6th grade  So I'm kind of with Ant's  Point  When you don't understand it yet  It's a little weird  And strange to you  But  13  Not putting up 
[02:45:30]  Their numbers there  But I ran up into  The apple tree  Because I didn't want to  Sit there and have my dad  Explain sex to me  Dude  That would have been  The most horrific thing  The thought of my mother  Or father  Telling me anything  About sex  Is just  It would be insane  And we got bamboozled  That day  We went to school  Like it was  Any other day  But you know  The teachers and the parents  Were in on it  Where they called  All the parents  Said all right  Today we're showing the film  Oh boy  And then we're going to  Tell the kids  If they have any questions  To go home  And ask their questions 
[02:46:00]  Talk about this  With your parents  So then my dad goes  So how was school  And you know  And said something about  You know  I heard you saw the film today  You want to discuss it  And that's when I ran outside  And ran up into the tree  And then he had to  Like kind of  Talk me out of the  The male produces sperm  I vaguely remember  We were sitting on the couch  And it was all of a sudden  Talking about my mom's boobs  Or something  And how that comes into play  And I'm like  I don't need to hear this from you  The penis becomes a wreck 
[02:46:30]  We didn't get any of that  It is  Oh the projector's all fucked up  What happened  Where's the A.V. kid  That knows where to stick  The pencil to fix it  And your mom's vagina  My mom's vagina  Oh I don't want to know  About that  That's between you and her dad  Your father put his erect penis  In your mother's vagina  Right  He pulled out  And came on her face  The first few times  Just gets real graphic 
[02:47:00]  And uncomfortable  When your mom's on her  Period  Daddy  Puts it where the poo comes out  He might jam it in her shitter  Right  But this will not make a baby  No  That's the educational part  Oh it won't  Or he treats her mouth  Like a vagina  And humps furiously  While she struggles for air  Daddy has needs  That mommy provides  Sometimes he'll give her  A chili dog 
[02:47:30]  Daddy will duty on mommy's chest  And then put his erect penis  Between her breasts  Your dad likes it  When she reaches down  And squeezes his balls  Right  Wait a minute  Once again this will not  Produce a kid  Of course I ran into  An apple tree  Yeah that shit's  I don't need my dad  Talking to me about that shit  Yeah you don't want to  Hear that from them  I don't want to know  Anything about that  I remember fucking  Like I was trying  To find something

[02:54:00]  Are happening at that age  It didn't matter  What they looked like  Tits look like maracas  But when they're seen over  And their tits  Touch your shoulder  To help you  Oh all that stuff  You want them  All that stuff is ridiculous  Yes Tom  Hey I just got to work now  But I got to say  One more thing  Which one of you guys  Likes Asia  Anthony right  Yep Anthony loves Asia  Why  First super group  Asia  I pretty much  Have had enough  With Anthony  Talking about Asia  It was a fun little bit  For I don't know  Like a week or two  But the only guy 
[02:54:30]  Just keeps going  With the damn thing  First super group  When did they come out  I don't know  This is your thing  Oh I would think  81  82  Okay  Okay then  I think they'd be  The second super group  Because  Bad company  Is a super group  And they're like  Bad company  Well that's why  Ant's Asia bit  Is brilliant  Oh  Let me tell you  Why your Asia  Asia bit  Is brilliant  Please do  I'd like to hear  Because everyone knows  There were super groups  Before Asia  So for you to say 
[02:55:00]  It's the first super group  Asia  That's the brilliance  Of the bit  Yeah it is  And it frustrates  People out there  Because they all know  There are other super groups  That came before  Did Anthony know that  When he said it  Or did he say it  At first  Not knowing  Because he's a bit  Of an idiot  No no no  We all know  Anthony's highly  Intelligent  With his concepts  For the radio show  What I love about Anthony  And like the Asia bit  For instance  Sure sure  He makes people think 
[02:55:30]  It's not right  On the surface  They go home  With that shit  And go  God was that brilliant  Exactly  Might not get the laughs  Right away  But it gets you  Thinking after the fact  Alright  Okay  Can I answer your question  Jimmy  Okay  Now  Now I get it  Alright Tommy  I feel like you've just been  Leading me in circles  About this Asia shit  Maybe  No  Alright  Thank you sir 
[02:56:00]  Alright let's say hi  To Jake in Seattle  I gotta admit  The phones were sucking today  But I think we're  Back on track  Yeah maybe  Let's go Jake  Can I wake my kids  Jake  Jake  Hey how's it going  Right about now  I'm Paul R. Nelson  So uh  Yep  In high school  I was partying  At my buddy's house  And he got all fucked up  So I went snooping  In his bathroom  Found a dildo  And started 
[02:56:30]  Fucking in the mouth  With it  Wait that's a little  Different than what  It says you want  To talk about  Which is fine  It said I made  My buddy suck  His mom's dildo  Oh he woke up  And I kept  Making him do it  Yeah you made him  You shoved  What you were  Fucking your friend  With his mom's dildo  Yeah I grabbed  A dildo  Mouthfucking him  And I was  Shoving it in his mouth  Making shoot short  What I guess  Uh  This is the idea  That he would do that  To a sleeping friend  Friend's sleeping 
[02:57:00]  He puts his  I was just thinking  I would just pretend  To be asleep  His own mom's dildo  Oh wow  That's sick  That's such a  Teenage guy thing  To do  Oh yeah  Your friend dozes off  And you find  His mother's dildo  And you put it  In his mouth  Shoving his mouth  What is that  Hey what is that  It's your mother's dildo  Fucking mom's dildo  If you fucking  Dude when you wake up  With something in your mouth  And say what is that  There's no answer worse  Than your mother's dildo  Your father's dildo  Is the only answer  That's worse 
[02:57:30]  All right listen  The phones are lit  With the most ridiculous  Fucking things  I've ever seen  I love it  I gotta move on  Quickly  Cause I don't wanna  Lose any of these guys  Bobby in Kentucky  Go ahead  Hey what's up  My goal here  Is to get  Jim a little harder  I think that's good  But when I was 15  My uncle and his aunt  Used to live with  Grandparents  In the basement 
[02:58:00]  Downstairs  So I discovered  Trying to retrieve a shirt  Out of their room  That she would sleep  With her shirt off  No bra or nothing  And you know  During the summer days  Sometimes that  Blanket would come off  A little  And I would sneak in  And I always told myself  I was like  One day  I'm gonna work myself  Up to touching it  Oh  Wait  Your own aunt's boobs  By marriage  That's fine  Oh by marriage  Okay  I'm sorry  By marriage 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  We're good  And  Yeah we're good  We're good  Okay we're good  I never could  Get the ball  To actually touch it  But man  Those suppled  Seeds  Are just  It burns  Into my memory  So you would sneak in  And just watch her sleep  Because her boobs  Were exposed  Her tits were out  Absolutely  I think I probably  Would have done that too  How old were you though  30?  32?  Oh okay  Gotta catch the peak  Right  I love picking down  A girl's shirt  And seeing a nipple man  It never gets old  Never 
[02:59:00]  Oh that's great  I remember the first time  I did that  I was really young  And my parents went  To a vacuum cleaner store  And the girl who was like  Showing them the vacuum cleaner  Was like kneeling  I was just standing  Staring right down her shirt  At her tits  It's called an abortion clank  By the way  That's true  And they were saying  They were saying something  About retroactive  And they were putting me out  I'm like  What are they doing  Why are they honoring me  I was at the playground  This weekend  This reminded me of something 
[02:59:30]  I totally forgot about  Until this second  A woman was breastfeeding  In the open  Off to the side  Oh  But she was far enough away  That you know  She was doing her own thing  And I'm walking with my son  And I went  Oh my god  Is that a  Like Jimmy just said  A boob  I'm like oh my god  That's amazing  I want to see it  And at that moment  I kind of took the stick  My son was playing with  And I kind of  Like put it down  And just  I didn't want him  Having this dumb stick anymore  And then  As I walked by the lady  I'm now with my son again 
[03:00:00]  And I'm like  Man I want another  I want another look  Another peek  And at that moment  Like God intervened  Because my son goes  Daddy where's my stick  And I went  Oh let me go get that for you  Oh I got it  And he said it loud enough  Where I know she heard  So now I had the excuse  To double back  Without looking like a creep  So I got my second peek  Did she see you  Did she catch you peeking  Uh no I don't think so  No we're pretty good at that right  You did that home  Or she probably knew  That I was like  You know  The side of your eye  Where you fucking  You wind up 
[03:00:30]  Two seconds of looking  And you had a headache  For ten hours  Because you've overextended  Your eye muscles  To look to the side  No  No  Let me see  Oh yeah okay  This is one of the other ones  We wanted  George in East Brunswick  George  Yeah I was  Remember I was in sixth grade  And I had this really hot  Looking teacher  And she had  Now this was the 70's  She had hair down to her ass  Long straight hair  She was so sexy  But she had the nerdy 
[03:01:00]  Librarian glasses  And she was reading  A story to the class  And I remember  I was just staring  At her tits  The whole time  I didn't hear a word  She was saying  But the whole time  I was just  Absolutely fixated  On her tits  And it got so bad  So obvious  She had to get up  In the middle of  Telling the story  And put a sweater on  Because I couldn't  Take my eyes off her  This is bringing back  Memories of being  A teenage boy  Man  It was out of control  Yeah  You were just  On automatic  You didn't even realize  What you were doing 
[03:01:30]  You did it  Yeah  We still look  But do you remember  Like everything was  A turn on back then  Everything  And the work you'd go through  To try to catch a sneak peek  Right  Kids these days  Like just walking around  With a phone  You have the most  Giant collection  Of hardcore pornography  At your fingertips  Every kid has that  You don't understand  What it was like  To have to search  That shit out  We would  You would go through  Magazines  Yeah  If you were lucky enough 
[03:02:00]  To get dirty magazines  That was like  That was great  But you would go  Through regular magazines  Just trying to find  Something that might be  A bit of a turn on  Or whatever  Panty ads  Or fucking bikinis  It's a joke  That's been done  A million times  Where like the  African tribe pictures  Even were just amazing  Amazing turn ons  Tahiti girls  Tahiti  Like Tahiti  They had weird boobs  Man  Nah they were better  Than the African ones  That's for sure  Tahiti boobs  Please  African boobs  It's like  Oh look at this girl  She's 13  She's stepping on her nipples
