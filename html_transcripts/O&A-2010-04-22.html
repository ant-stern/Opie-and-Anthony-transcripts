<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion about the lengths of various sports seasons and the perceived effort of athletes, peppered with profanity and sexually suggestive comments.  Key moments included a debate about a baseball player's home-plate jump, a caller's recounting of a 28-inning baseball game, and a discussion of a lawsuit against a gay softball league.  Larry King's marital troubles, specifically his wife's alleged affair with her son's baseball coach, were also a significant topic. The South Park Muhammad controversy was briefly mentioned, and the hosts teased an upcoming segment about a recent gun purchase.

The show then featured Betalica, a live in-studio band, whose performance, the hosts admitted, was poorly chosen and drew listener criticism. This led to a "douche list" discussion targeting various musicians like Sting, Neil Young, Tommy Lee, Gene Simmons, Ted Nugent, and Scott Weiland, with anecdotes about Weiland's past difficult behavior on the show.  The declining ratings of *Lost* were also briefly mentioned. Opie then shared a long, rambling story about his difficult family relationships, including his grandmother's death and other strained familial connections.  This segued into a discussion about animal behavior, focusing on the perceived nervousness of certain animals, differences in predator and prey eye placement, and a listener-submitted video of a deer tangled in a bird feeder. The conversation drifted to a *Life* documentary about primates, hot springs, and a related personal anecdote involving the hosts and their irritated girlfriends.  The segment concluded with negative reviews of the Green Day and *Addams Family* Broadway musicals, a commercial for the *Enron* musical, a mention of Al Pacino's portrayal of Kevorkian, and a failed attempt to get listeners to explain Pink Floyd's *The Wall*.

A subsequent, highly vulgar segment featured discussions about Pink Floyd's *The Wall* (with various interpretations, including crude ones, from the hosts and a caller named Fuzzy), technical difficulties, and an upcoming "Cherry Darts" contest with a sexually suggestive premise and a diamond-encrusted iPad prize.  Danny, a staff member, provided contact information for the event.  D-Boy, a possible studio guest, detailed a graphic account of his food poisoning.  A clip of Rahm Emanuel was played and mocked, and the hosts sarcastically discussed Earth Day, pivoting to crude jokes about volcanoes, specifically Icelandic ones, including a discussion of the Surtsey island formation.  This segued back to Larry King’s marital problems, with extensive discussion and clips of Hector Panante’s *Entertainment Tonight* interview, accompanied by graphic descriptions and sexually explicit language.

A later segment started with sexually suggestive banter involving an elderly man’s wife and lawn care, followed by a vulgar phone call with a caller named Larry, and Snoop Dogg's supposed avoidance of Larry.  This transitioned into a humorous, nonsensical troubleshooting session with a caller having Wi-Fi issues, featuring a Radio Shack impersonation.  Andrew Dice Clay then offered his uniquely offensive and misogynistic parenting advice. Vitalica, the Metallica/Beatles parody band, joined the show, discussing their origins, legal challenges, and performing songs like "I Want to Choke Your Brain" and "Hero of the Day Tripper." The segment also included interruptions from children outside the studio, discussions of Vitalica's website, a Lane Bryant advertisement, and the purchase of a rifle by a staff member.  A sexually explicit conversation with a female caller, Brandy, culminated in her broadcasting herself masturbating.  The segment concluded with escalating arguments between Opie and a listener, Chris, further sexually explicit comments, discussions of guns and violence, and a final exchange with Vitalica.

The show's final segment featured the abrupt end of a call with Brandy, criticism of an emailer named Danny for overly polished writing, and vulgar mockery of Danny's imagined relationship conflicts.  The hosts discussed their plans to go shooting, detailing their firearm purchases.  Further discussions included the perceived slowness of co-host Chris and a vulgar back-and-forth with someone called "Chip," speculating on Jerry Seinfeld's potential reaction to Chip. The segment ended with a tease of a future "precious talk" segment, hinting at more uncomfortable family anecdotes, all while employing consistently offensive and misogynistic language.

[00:00:00]  Motherfucker, un-ass me.  That's how you do it.  Damn.  Holy shit.  That's how you do it.  That's it.  Hey, all right.  Un-ass me.  That's how you do it.  Let's go.  Let's go.

No, you don't shit on me.  Oh, my God.  David, David.  David, David, David.  Hey, David, David.  I'm going to hire a bodyguard for you. 
[00:00:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  I just, I watch the comedians who drink and make asses out of themselves.  And I'm like, first of all, it would be worse.  Yeah.  I know that I would kind of like half wake up.  I'd be on the floor.  I'd be crying.  And everybody would be just kind of looking at me.  Wow.  And I'd have to be let out.  That bad it would be.  I was a crier.  I was a caller.  I was a cutter.  Anything with a C, I did. 
[00:01:00]  That was bad.  Aw.  Cry and call and cuttin' all my.  Cuck holding.  Cuck holding.  Aw.  Someone has a problem with the Bluetooth's in the theater?  Oh, God.  Fuck that.  Lieutenant O'Hora with the fucking thing in your ear.  Is that it?  Fuck that.  Everyone's fucking smartphones.  I call them smartphones because people, you know.  You know what, though?  Not everyone has the iPhone.  Beats the fuck out of ringing cell phones that you used to get.  People are texting now, so you will see a seat light up here and there.  You know, it's like, fuck, dunk, dunk, dunk. 
[00:01:30]  But that, dude, I will take that any day over.  Back in the old days?  Holy shit.  Turn it.  I need you, people.  Turn it off.  Hurry up.  You're dropping brains.  Don't drop the brains.  Eat the brains.  Have some brains.  E-Roc's got more brains on his little finger.  Come on.  Here he goes.  Piece of membrane.  There he goes.  Right in there. 
[00:02:00]  Now, chew, chew.  It's probably good, right?  Oh!  Oh, chew it, chew it, chew it.  Those little piggy thoughts.  Piggy thoughts.  Piggy thoughts.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  All right, we're going to learn what this accent thing is all about right here.  Doctors diagnosed it as FAS, and the F does not.  I know what that is.  Uh-oh, what is it?  Fucking asshole syndrome.  You're fucking British, you're talking about a Chinese accent, you're a fucking asshole. 
[00:02:30]  Fucking asshole.  Fucking stop doing that syndrome.  Fucking asshole syndrome.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See, kids, smoke your pot, play your video games, and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:07:00]  Ah, greetings, salutations.  What is a salutation?  It's like a hi.  It's a salute, a salutation, a how do you do?  How do you do?  I feel bad for Travis and his habitants. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, what's happened to the Habs?  It's because you call them that, you know, by the way, instead of the Canadians.  Oh, I'm pretty sure that's not why they're losing.  No, that's it.  You're jinxing them by calling them the Habs.  They have more Stanley Cubs than anyone.  You're trying to be cool.  Well, apparently they better kick it into gear.  They ain't going to have another one this year.  But they've also been part of the league since the, oh boy, wow, did I mess that one up.  Okay, I'm going to fucking stop right there.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow, okay.  Since they were the Habitants. 
[00:08:00]  The Habitants lost 6-3 last night, you were telling me, Travis.  Yeah, sure did.  Ovechkin had what, two?  Yeah.  Good old Ovechkin.  What happened?  It was a good two periods, and then they decided they didn't need to show up for the third.  Oh, yeah, they thought like, fuck it, we won.  They said, we'll just go to overtime, but they didn't get there.  And then, oh, that's, aw.  Sorry to hear that.  No, you're not.  Why?  It's not going well.  My Yankees had a great night, sorry.  Yeah, I'm sad. 
[00:08:30]  But no one cares, man.  You better care.  It's fucking your cousin.  Well, my cousin had a really good outing, but that's what I'm trying to tell you.  I don't even follow my cousin until, I don't know, another few months.  You'd think you'd be more of a Yankee fan, too.  And get me some tickets.  I could get you tickets at any time.  I can call him, call up that cousin, and get us some good fucking dugout tickets.  Phil Hughes, he rocks, but, you know.  Chicked ass.  But, I mean, I'm still not a Yankee fan, even though I'm related to Phil Hughes. 
[00:09:00]  When did the Yankees have their during the season crash?  Like, baseball is not quite like football, where, you know, football, you have only so  many games, so your team's good, and then if it starts getting bad, you're fucking done.  And then you could start out good, and you can end up sucky.  Right.  Or you could start out a little sucky and end up really good.  But it's got to be within a really short period of time with football. 
[00:09:30]  You can't sustain 162 games?  This is insanity, the Yankees, right now.  You know, what are they, fucking 11-3?  Are they really?  Yeah, it's like a six-game winning streak.  They're doing great.  Rivera's four saves, right?  Seven saves, I'm sorry.  Seven fucking saves?  And A-Rod is starting to hit home runs for you.  Yeah.  So, he had one, not last night, the night before, right?  Yep.  Ah, whatever, it's baseball.  I know, people say, ah, well, it's baseball, it's early in the season. 
[00:10:00]  I understand that, but it's just nice to see.  We're heading into spring, and they'll be playing baseball until middle of fall.  I know.  All right?  Yes.  So, we have to get through spring, summer, and part of fall, and baseball will still be happening.  You know what, though?  It really is just nice to see a team, because they look very good.  They just look very good.  It doesn't matter.  You're playing well.  You're playing the World Series, and seven lousy games.  All of a sudden, you have a cold streak, and even though you had a great season, you lose 
[00:10:30]  the World Series.  I know.  It happens all the time to teams.  It's just nonsense.  It really is just nonsense.  The beginning of the season doesn't matter, and then when your team is doing very well  at the beginning of the season, then you've got to worry that maybe they can't sustain it.  Well, how do you keep your excitement up?  With games like last night, it was good.  You know, you've got a no-hitter into the eighth.  That's kind of exciting.  And then the guy's got to blow it. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, but you still have 148 games to go.  So, 148 goodness games.  How many football seasons is 148 games?  Let me try this.  Oh, my God.  Do a little math.  That would be...  Do a little math.  What?  Nine?  I would say about nine seasons.  Yeah.  90, 54, that would be about 144.  144. 
[00:11:30]  So, that's nine seasons of football you've got left.  Nine seasons.  Are you kidding me?  Is it nine seasons of football?  Well, that's based on a 16-game season.  Yeah, sure.  Damn.  Nine seasons left of football.  That is something.  That would take you to the year 2019, Anthony, proving how ridiculous baseball is with this  162-game season.  Come on.  And we just suck as humans.  We can't adapt fast enough.  We really adapt very, very slowly. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Because 162 games, we've done this break, I know, made sense when there wasn't a lot  of entertainment.  There was nothing else to do.  We didn't have our phones.  We didn't have the internet.  We barely had TV.  We did have radio.  You had to wait for, like, shows to come into your town.  You didn't really have movies when baseball started.  Yeah.  You didn't really communicate with other people that much, to tell you the truth.  Right.  So it was a whole social thing.  Go to the ballpark.  You know, get some air.  Freaking talk to some people.  Get your entertainment. 
[00:12:30]  And then go back to the fucking fields and grow something.  I don't know.  Why can't we adapt and realize that's crazy now?  And you cut the baseball season in half.  And now every game is pretty exciting.  Yeah.  Very exciting.  Absolutely.  But your team had a great outing, but they still have 148 games to go.  It's tradition.  It's tradition.  We don't like giving up on tradition in America, right?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We love our tradition.  And Kyle's saying the games in April matter just as much.  Not really.  Maybe for one or two teams in the end. 
[00:13:00]  You know, that one team that missed out, missed the playoffs by, you know, a game or two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kyle, go ahead.  What do you got on that?  Yeah, but that's the thing, Todd.  How many times do we sit there and even though they now have the wild card teams that get in,  it's so exciting in the last week of the season because, you know, they're one or two games apart.  But it's those two or three games in April and May that we're not really watching that really mattered the most  because then it wouldn't be mattering at the end of the season.  You know what I'm saying?  I know it's 162 games and you're kind of like, oh, damn, 162. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  You know, they play like each game matters.  You know, it could make it just as exciting.  You know, in the last few years I realized that I'm just not a baseball fan.  Is that what it is?  A lot of years on this show I've been rah-rah, Mets, Mets.  But that was based on growing up as a kid and watching the Mets and really being into baseball.  I realize I'm just not into baseball.  Well, you know what it is, too.  It's like the hockey season.  You have the second season.  Everybody gets ramped up for the playoffs.  Right.  With basketball, you have 88 games. 
[00:14:00]  And who wants to sit there and watch 88 games?  You know, even though they're all important, now there's a playoff.  Now people get excited.  I think like a 50-game season would be amazing for baseball.  A 50-game season.  It would be amazing for basketball, hockey.  If you cut hockey down to like 40 games, that would be amazing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You said you're a big hockey fan, right?  Huge.  Well, not huge, but pretty big, yeah.  So how do you feel about the regular season? 
[00:14:30]  It gets a little, you know, monotonous.  It really does.  Although my team, it wasn't monotonous because, you know, we were fighting to try to make the playoffs the entire year.  Falling short, obviously.  But if you have a really good team, it's monotonous after a while.  Yeah.  Like, you know your guys are going to be in the playoffs already, Ed.  Well, you never know.  They're 11-3.  What do you mean?  That's what the great thing about baseball is, Opie. 
[00:15:00]  You just never know.  All right.  They're probably going to be in the end.  Play this tape back.  It's a guarantee.  That's why they...  That's why it's a bore for those guys.  They already know they're going to make the playoffs.  So now they've just got to wait, what, eight months to see if they can win another World Series?  I'm sure they enjoy making a lot of money for just, you know, being there.  Right.  All right, Kyle.  That was a great way to say that.  You know, that...  What?  As far as, you know, they already know they're going to make the playoffs. 
[00:15:30]  Now they've got to wait eight months or seven months to get into it.  You know, I really thought about it that way.  It's true, though.  I mean, they're not going to lay down or anything.  They're going to continue playing, but it's already in their heads that they're a playoff  team, and the odds are extremely good that they're going to be in the playoffs.  So now they've got to wait until October to see how good this team really is.  Well, you know what?  Here in the first inning last night with the Yankee game against the A's, Derek Cheater  tries to steal second base two times, right? 
[00:16:00]  In the first inning, no outs, right?  So the sheriff strikes out.  Cheater's trying to steal third, and the first inning was no outs.  I mean, so there's a guy that plays 100% all the time.  That's right.  He's a hustler.  He can hustle that guy.  Fantastic.  I don't think, you know what?  I don't think athletes, this is going to be controversial, but I don't think athletes  play 100% all the time.  I don't think they come close to playing 100% all the time.  And what made me realize that was watching Olympic hockey.  You go, wow, this is what these guys could do if they go all out every game. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because both sides are like, you know what?  This is just a regular season game, so our side's playing at 90%, and their side's playing  about 90%.  Did you see that Olympic hockey, how different that was?  Because every fucking...  Every little fucking pass made a difference.  Every time someone had the puck, it mattered.  Yeah.  I really don't believe professional athletes play at 100% day in and day out.  No way. 
[00:17:00]  They hit 100% from time to time.  Yeah.  Right.  But it's an unspoken thing, I believe, with both teams that are like, you know what?  Yeah, all right, you're going to play at 85% today?  All right, we'll play at 85% too.  Yeah.  Because, you know, we're a little tired from the West Coast swing, so we're going to tone  it down a little bit.  You know what I'm thinking, players or a team as a whole are not playing 100%, not especially,  but in baseball?  The second game of the doubleheader. 
[00:17:30]  That has to be, like, you've finished the game, you've played your, hopefully, only nine  innings in the first game, and you're done.  And then it's like, all right, do it again.  Start over.  You're at inning one and go.  Right.  You cannot possibly be as into it as you are in first inning of game one.  Right.  It's just amazing.  Especially when they still do the doubleheader, by the way.  Especially with 148 games to go.  Yes. 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  Yes.  Really?  Does that second game in the doubleheader really get you pumped up?  Aren't you just standing there going, ah, fine.  And why don't they take a three or four hour break and have some dinner, clear out the stadium,  bring in a whole nother crew?  They have actually taken longer breaks recently than they used to.  Right.  They used to go, boom, right back into the fucking game.  That was it.  Right.  Now they have taken some.  But I think that's more for television.  Why don't they do that to make money?  Yeah, to make money.  Because they do turn over. 
[00:18:30]  They turn over the crowd.  Yeah, you're not allowed to sit in the same game anymore.  Yeah, that's it.  You used to sit there to go to a doubleheader, and you'd watch both games.  Right.  Now they clear everyone, get the fuck out, let's get some new fucking suckers in here.  Because they want, like, a fresh crowd.  Yeah.  Because the players are tired.  But as a kid, when your friend or somebody said, hey, man, I got tickets for a doubleheader.  Fuck, two games?  I got two games.  Two games better than one game.  They should play one 18-inning game for two wins. 
[00:19:00]  And then it would be very important, right?  You don't want to lose two fucking games.  You know what?  If you're, like, leading by one run at the end of nine, you're not going to relax going into ten.  Nope.  Now, meanwhile, you might relax a little going into the second game and the first inning.  Makes for an exciting 18-inning game.  18 innings.  Let's just change the rules a little bit.  Yeah.  Shuffle them around a little bit.  Shuffle them around.  Kyle, I interrupted you. 
[00:19:30]  What were you saying there?  Are you good?  Eh.  Last week, someone, one team played 20 innings.  Was that another Mets game?  A what?  Oh, yeah.  The Mets got into a ridiculous inning game.  Oh, yeah.  We talked about that.  That was last, what, Saturday or something?  Yeah.  Right now, the guy that was catching for the other team went 20 innings, right?  And then had to come back and play a day game the next day.  Right.  And he caught the whole game.  So, it was, like, the first time since 1970-something that somebody went 20 innings behind the plate.  And then came back the next day to a live. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  That's crazy.  I would love to just tap him in his knees.  See how his knees are feeling.  All right, Kyle.  Thank you.  We've got to give him a...  Thank you, guys.  Watch it out.  Yeah, right on.  Let's say hi to Mike on Long Island.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, yo.  Opie.  Yeah.  You know better than anybody.  Islanders Rangers.  Islanders play their fucking asses off against the Rangers.  They play like their playoff team.  And then what happens when they play the Colorado Avalanche next night?  Nothing.  They suck balls.  See, I'm telling you, I'm onto... 
[00:20:30]  I think I'm onto something a little bit here because he's right.  I mean, in this neck of the woods, a Ranger-Islander game is just amazing.  It's huge.  And wherever you live in the country, you've got your own rivalries.  And you know your team steps up for these big rivalry games.  And you're seeing these guys going 100%, 110%, whatever.  And then, sure, the next day they play a who-gives-a-shit team.  And it's a completely different team on the ice.  Proving that...  Proving they don't go 100% every game of the year.  No way.  How would they? 
[00:21:00]  Yes, Mike.  One more thing.  Yeah.  How about when at the end of the hockey games, when you call the goalie for the last minute 30?  Do you ever see more intense hockey in your life?  It's unbelievable.  I could switch turns on.  I love it.  I love when they go four-on-four.  I love it.  I think that you need to make a little more room on the ice.  Yeah, well, that didn't work out so well in the Olympics for us this year.  Well, but that Olympic hockey was just fucking amazing.  All right, buddy, punch it out.  And I think it really does prove that these guys, they don't go 100%.  They just don't.  They can't. 
[00:21:30]  You can't go 100% for 162 games.  You just can't.  No.  Let's say hi to Tom in D.C.  Tom.  Hey, there, Tom.  Hey, man.  Went to a game.  My dad has to be a saint for this one.  1968.  I'm a bit of an older gentleman.  The old stadium.  20-night doubleheader.  First game ended normally nine innings.  Second game went 19 innings.  They called it at 1 a.m. because it was curfew.  Too late.  So that's 28 innings of baseball. 
[00:22:00]  We had a...  My cousin and I had a ball.  My dad was just like, oh, my God, get me out of here.  Yeah, of course.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Very good.  All right, man.  Can you imagine that in?  No.  Doubleheader, nine innings and then 19 innings?  No.  No.  Whatever.  Oh, what was that guy jumping over the catcher?  Was that a college game?  Yeah, a college game.  Was it Iona?  I'm sure most people have seen the video by now.  If you haven't, search it out today.  Guys running for home.  Catchers right in the way. 
[00:22:30]  Right in the way.  It's one of those classic, you know, the guy's going to plow into the catcher.  If the catcher can hold onto the ball and tag him, the guy's out.  Yeah.  If the catcher drops the ball, he's safe.  But the catcher had a good squat stance.  The ball was right there, tight in his glove.  It looked like the guy was going to be out.  Well, he's dead in the water, as they like to say.  Dead in the water.  And the guy just...  How do you explain this?  I mean, he jumps right over the catcher, but it's like a...  Yeah, he does a flip in midair. 
[00:23:00]  He jumps over the catcher, comes down on his hands, right on home plate.  And the up's there going safe.  And the catcher's like, what the fuck happened?  The catcher goes, what the fuck?  The catcher never touched him.  He's looking to hit him forward.  The guy flies like a bird over his fucking head.  And is able to control his momentum so he can hit the plate.  Because when he jumped, it looked like there's no way he's going to be able to...  He's going to go flying by the plate, but he doesn't.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  Danny, send me that link. 
[00:23:30]  I'll fucking tweet that so people can check it out.  But I'm sure most people have seen it by now.  Yeah.  And it was a college baseball game.  Was it Seton Hall?  Was it local?  I don't think so.  Who was it?  Iona and Fordham.  Oh, Fordham.  Okay.  Fordham.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Chicago.  Eddie.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  Eddie.  Hey.  I just wanted to say, if you watch LeBron James play nowadays, he fucking dogs it.  The whole first half of the game.  Until he has to turn it on in the second half. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  You know, he kicks ass in the second half of the game, scoring his ass off.  And the first half of the game, he just fucking walks around.  You see it all the time, because these guys have got to pace themselves for a very long  season.  And that's why I think if you cut these games down, you're going to see these guys, you're  going to see what they could really do day in and day out.  It's like a chess match with these guys.  Like LeBron James, let's say.  Okay.  LeBron's like, you know what?  I'm going 80 right now.  I'm 80%. 
[00:24:30]  Then the other team's like going 90, 95.  And LeBron goes, oh, really?  All right.  Well, I'm pumping it up to 95.  Turbo.  I didn't know we were going 95 today.  I got to hit the nitrous.  Right.  And then they back off a little bit.  It's just a little give and take with the teams.  Being from Chicago, I'm from a city with Jordan Pippen.  Sure.  Those guys went all fucking game.  That's why they were so great.  They won six championships almost in a row.  You know what?  That kind of blows my theory out of the water, because I kind of agree with you. 
[00:25:00]  That Bulls team, they seemed like they were just pushing the entire season.  You hold on to that, Cut.  It was a different time back then.  You mean how?  Right.  Hold on to your basketball legacy.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you, brother.  Bye.  Jamie in Pittsburgh.  Jamie.  Hey, guys.  Are you crying?  I got a story about the doubleheader.  You didn't even acknowledge my horrid Van Halen reference.  And he's still talking. 
[00:25:30]  I was a kid.  He went to a doubleheader.  Does this happen in real life when people just keep talking?  I've been in certain bars.  And they just continue like this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  And they don't even know that we're not any manager or listening to them?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to.  What is this about?  All of a sudden.  This would never happen in real life.  I was straight ahead.  In real life.  Even an inkling that something is going on.  In real life, someone would stop talking and go, oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're not listening to me.  Yeah, exactly.  Let me start over.  Exactly. 
[00:26:00]  Jamie.  Hello?  How are you doing?  I'm getting an echo.  Sorry.  I got an echo in your brain.  What were you saying, Jamie?  I got an echo.  Jamie, what were you saying?  I wanted to give you a little story about an 18-inning game I won, too, that was part  of a doubleheader when I was a kid, when the Pirates were worth watching.  And, yeah, it was long even as a kid.  And also, I wanted to tell you about that on-and-off switch for hockey players. 
[00:26:30]  I'm a big Penguin fan.  And you could tell during the season that they play with their competition.  You know what I mean?  So, yeah, you're right about the games as being too long.  And this isn't a good year to judge the hockey because it's the Olympics.  You know, but during a season where there's no Olympic break, it's still, I think it's  worth playing, you know, 60 games to pull.  Look, you know what?  My Islanders are obviously playing golf, but, I mean, playoff hockey, you see what these  guys could do.  They pump it way up. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, obviously.  They pump it way up.  Proving my point, they don't do that during the regular season.  No.  They play hard enough to, you know, to hopefully get a win for the team.  Yeah, you know what?  I think Sidney Crosby pretty much goes 100%.  You could tell he does.  I don't acknowledge that, sir.  His name is Cindy Crosby.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, the old coach here called him.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, it's a vein.  So, yeah, but, no, I mean, okay, I know if you're not from Pittsburgh, you hate Sidney Crosby.  It's, you know, you've got to love him. 
[00:27:30]  You know what?  If he was an Islander, I would love him, though.  That's just how it works.  I'm sorry.  If he was an Islander, I hate him as much as I hate Ovechkin, you know.  There you go.  That's how it works.  All right, Jamie.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that.  Back in the day, a little while ago, the Penguins, in the early 90s, they didn't shut it off.  All right.  With one of you guys, but, yeah, that's all I wanted.  I wanted to, you know.  It's all?  That was a lot.  All right, Jamie.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Let me say hi to Kenny in Jersey. 
[00:28:00]  Kenny.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  What's up, Kenny?  None of the time.  I just said that college play was pretty wild, but I don't know if you guys had to see that  moving major league.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the same thing.  Wesley Snipes or one of them, it was either one or two, whoever played the black man,  the second one, coming home, catches low, right over him.  Same technique, you know, same play.  Willie Mays Hayes.  Willie Mays Hayes.  Yeah, Willie Mays Hayes.  Very good, Danny. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, you know what?  That was a movie, though.  This was real life, and it counted, and it was, I think it's more amazing.  No, no, I was just saying, it was the exact same thing.  It was cool.  All right.  Right on, brother.  No problem, man.  Thank you.  All right, we'll try to move on.  I didn't even realize we were going down that road to start the show there.  But congratulations to your Yankees at 11 and 3.  Yeah, that's a good start.  Good start.  And a big win for my cousin, Phil Hughes.  Yes.  Anthony, speaking of baseball, we move into the softball world.  Did you hear about this story?  A softball story? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, wait.  I might have.  Go ahead.  The bisexual men who are suing a gay group?  Yes.  There's a gay softball world series?  Of course there is.  So there's a gay softball league, and there's a big lawsuit because, um, is it a team or  a few players are claiming that some of the players on a certain team weren't gay enough?  Not gay enough.  For the gay softball league.  How is that decided?  That you're not gay enough? 
[00:29:30]  Three bisexual men are suing a national gay athletic organization saying they were discriminated  against during the gay softball world series held in the Seattle area two years ago.  Gay softball league.  The three Bay Area men say the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Alliance.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's pretty gay.  In essence, deem them not gay enough to participate in the series.  And not gay enough.  Wow.  I guess they were able to throw the ball. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Just that little girly throw.  You don't have the girly throw?  Like, how do they decide that they're not gay enough?  The girly throw.  The lawsuit.  Like, you want to be in the gay softball league that bad that you're going to fake your gayness?  Yeah.  If you sign up, shouldn't that be good enough?  As a ringer?  Who would put themselves through that?  I know.  I need to be in the gay softball league.  The lawsuit filed Tuesday, blah, blah, blah.  Okay. 
[00:30:30]  Beth.  We're not.  Okay.  The three plaintiffs, Stephen, Leron, and John, played on a team called D2 that qualified for the 2008 Gay Softball World Series, which is organized by the Alliance.  The Alliance's rules say that each World Series team can have no more than two heterosexual players.  No more than two guys that like the pussy.  Right.  And I guess they had... 
[00:31:00]  Those would be the home run hitters.  They had more.  Yeah, yeah.  You got those.  They better be good fucking players.  They better be like Mark McGuire.  If they don't suck the cock, you've got to fucking be good.  Imagine your two heterosexual players are just bunters.  I'm like, oh, come on, man.  You're wasting your fucking...  You're wasting your heteros.  You're wasting your heteros.  You're wasting your clit lickers.  Each of the three plaintiffs were called into a conference room in front of more than 25 people, and they were asked personal and intrusive questions about his sexual attractions and desires purportedly to determine if the player was heterosexual or gay. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  The alliance has no category or definition for bisexual or transgender people in its rules.  At one point during the proceedings, the lawsuit alleges one of the plaintiffs was told, this is the gay world series, not the bisexual world series.  So they don't even like...  First of all, gay people...  Hello, gay people? 
[00:32:00]  If you're a man and you're bisexual...  If you're a woman, it's fine.  You know, they could carry on and, you know, whatever.  If you're a man and you're bisexual, you're gay.  You're gay!  It doesn't matter.  Suck one cock, suck a hundred.  That's my fucking theory.  Let's put that on a t-shirt.  That's my credo.  Let's walk around with that t-shirt.  The alliance ruled the three men were non-gay, stripped D2 of its second place finish, and 
[00:32:30]  recommend that the three players be suspended from participating in the World Series for  a year, according to the suit.  The men are asking for $75,000 each for emotional distress, blah, blah, blah.  Emotional distress?  Proving they're gay.  They're all emotionally distressed all the time.  If they're suing for that, then they have to be gay.  Emotional distress.  As a man, I don't know what emotional distress is.  Do you?  Emotional distress.  Do you know what that is?  Uh, no. 
[00:33:00]  No, I'm sorry.  I don't.  So, there you go.  A nice little story about a league.  Wow.  Claiming that they weren't gay enough to be in the league.  Not gay enough.  Why don't they just fucking, you know, fucking go with the fucking test?  Board members just drop fucking their pants.  Drop their pants and see who starts sucking.  Let's see how gay you really are.  Start sucking.  And, uh, like I said, though, if you're bi, you're fucking gay.  It's not, those guys, I don't care how fucking Mark McGuire arms they got on them. 
[00:33:30]  They're gay.  Gay.  Let's say hi to Matt in West Virginia.  Matt?  Yeah, there was another part of the article that I guess you didn't read.  Um, it says that the reason that the other teams were so upset is because they were so  good at coming from behind.  Ha ha.  Ha.  Boo.  Coming from behind.  See, that's a gay joke.  Yeah.  If you did it like Pat from Monocchio, I think we would have, uh, accepted that one, sir. 
[00:34:00]  Very, very nice.  Let's go to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  JJ.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to see if any of you caught the South Park, the finale of the Muhammad episode  last night.  Well.  It was pretty fantastic.  They actually, the first half, they edited out the image of Muhammad.  Somebody was talking about it yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, for the finish of it, they actually edited out the word Muhammad as well.  And so by the end of the episode where they start to learn their lesson like they do in 
[00:34:30]  every episode.  Of course.  They edited out the entire thing.  It got to the point where it was like, and I, boop.  They got, like, the last five minutes, there was four words unedited.  Now, is that on purpose?  Were they fucking around?  They were just, yeah, they were making fun of the fact that everything gets edited.  Oh, okay.  Okay, see, now we had this whole thing going on here this morning that it was a network  thing and it was real and shit like that.  I mean, the ending, I think that was, you know, drama.  Exactly.  I think the Muhammad thing was probably the network saying, well, let's just cover our 
[00:35:00]  ass.  And I think Matt and Trey just went, okay, let's cover our ass and literally edit out  the last five minutes of the show.  Yeah, just show how ridiculous it is.  I'll never understand that, that you got a controversial episode or a controversial  radio bit we've been down that road, and the thing has already aired.  It's out there.  It's, yeah.  And in this world, people are recording all the time. 
[00:35:30]  And then there's a replay or a repeat, and now they decide they got to edit the whole  thing or just not play it again.  It's too late at that point, isn't it?  It's too late.  Well, you might have emotions, and we got to protect you from those.  Right.  Of course.  Please.  And Matt and Trey put out a statement basically saying, suck my dick.  They said that yesterday, right?  No, I think that was just the Tyler Durden guy.  Oh, he was saying that they said that?  Here, I'll pull it up.  All right.  Wow, I read it wrong, then. 
[00:36:00]  No.  I hope he doesn't read wrong.  Thanks.  Which place, Matt, was it on?  Thanks for pointing that out.  I really appreciate it.  Fuck.  All right, boys.  I thought it was...  It's definitely worth catching the last...  I mean, I was enraged when they started editing Muhammad at the beginning of the episode.  Right.  I was like, holy shit, I can't believe they're doing this.  But by the end, I was laughing hysterically.  That last...  The last bit where all you get is four, like, conjunction words randomly placed in the middle  of five minutes of beeping. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I was sitting in my room by myself, just chuckling like a girl.  Right on.  All right, JJ.  All right, boys.  Take it easy.  Thank you, sir.  What does that statement say there, Anthony?  Yeah.  Or Danny?  Yeah, because I can't read it from here.  It's hard with the white frickin' font.  White over...  White font sucks.  Look, everyone.  It's Muhammad.  The silly bear is the prophet Muhammad, and his image is being depicted on this...  And this is why, you know, it's the Tyler Durden guy on this website.  And everyone can see it.  He's the one on the right, the cartoon bear.  That one is Muhammad.  It's just a silly joke, but there he is. 
[00:37:00]  And if any of you pussy Islamic savages don't like it, you can suck my dick.  So I think that's the Tyler Durden guy expressing his view on the subject.  Makes it sound like it might have been Matt and Trey saying, you could suck my dick a little  bit, though, right?  Because, I mean, Tyler Durden, dude, didn't have anything to do with the episode.  Yeah, true.  Well, I think if Matt and Trey told Islam to suck their dicks...  No kidding.  It would be in a few more places, but what would Tyler Durden do?  Yeah, that's a good point, too.  What a great statement, though.  That would have been by Matt and Trey. 
[00:37:30]  They've completely lost their minds.  All right.  Goddamn.  For them.  Let me say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Larry?  Gentlemen.  Jesus, what's up?  Larry King here.  How important are the balls?  For the gay softball league, sir?  How important are the balls?  Fucking Larry.  We got a great Larry King thing after the break, by the way. 
[00:38:00]  Larry.  Oh, yeah.  Larry's back in the news.  Well...  This whole scandal with the divorce between him and his wife.  There's allegations that Larry was fucking the wife's sister.  And then there's other allegations that the wife was fucking the karate instructor or something.  The kid's baseball coach.  Oh, the kid's baseball coach.  I was thinking Elvis.  But Larry is...  Larry's back with his wife.  Yeah.  And they're going to try to work out their...  What the hell's going on there? 
[00:38:30]  Try to work out their problems.  There's more pop-up every day.  How are they working this shit out?  This guy, he went on Entertainment Tonight.  I don't know his name.  We'll find out, I guess.  He was the baseball coach for Larry King's kids.  Yeah.  And basically, he's saying that, yeah, he was fucking Larry's wife.  Fucking Larry's wife.  In Larry's house.  In Larry's bed.  Oh!  While Larry was on the TV.  Oh, my God.  How embarrassing for Larry.  And we got the audio.  The guy did an exclusive for Entertainment Tonight.  So, we're going to play that in a little bit here. 
[00:39:00]  What a fucking...  What a prick watching him on TV.  Is he...  Yeah, his show is live, right?  I think so.  Yeah, because he takes calls like that.  He had Tom Sizemore on yesterday.  At least you know he's not going to come in.  Right.  That's what I always, like, not feared, but I always thought, like, boy, your girlfriend  could really...  It's easy for them to cheat on you because they could just turn the radio on and they  know exactly where you are.  It's guaranteed you're not walking through the fucking door and catching anybody in shenanigans 
[00:39:30]  because you're talking.  Right.  They know you're...  Yeah, it's...  Yeah.  Yeah, like if somebody's at work...  Yeah, if you have a regular job, all of a sudden you blow off half a day and go home  and she goes, what are you doing home so early?  Well, she wanted it, sir.  And then there's all kinds of horse shit going on.  And then, you know, and then let's say the wife calls the husband at work because she  wants to know he's at work.  Right.  It's still... 
[00:40:00]  All right, either she's calling the cell phone, where he could be anywhere, or it's  suspicious that she's calling.  Of course.  So the husband's like a little eh.  But radio, live TV, they can just peek in and go, all right, he's there.  Pull out your cock.  Well, that's what seemed to have happened with the Larry King thing.  Oh.  Larry's on the TV.  Poor Larry.  Stupid yoga on the TV.  Oh, God.  Obsessed with the dumb yoga on the TV.  Yeah.  Why would you suggest that for a sleep problem? 
[00:40:30]  Slept last night, though.  Yeah.  Got a little sleep in.  Actually heard the alarm clock for the first time in about a month.  Ooh.  You did.  And then lost my wallet, but found it.  I thought I left my wallet and started.  Yeah, that was a harrowing couple of minutes.  Opie thought he lost his wallet, and we all assumed Mars took it.  Well, he's the Puerto Rican.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to blame the Puerto Rican first. 
[00:41:00]  Well, yeah.  When you go into a panic, you look around and go, all right, it's the Puerto Rican.  Well, not first.  It all depends on who's in the room.  So he automatically went into the, it could have been Mars.  Right.  Um, but let's say other people were in the room of other backgrounds.  You'd probably assume it was them first.  You're beating around the bush.  What?  You would blame the black guy before the Puerto Rican guy?  I never said that.  I said people of other ethnic backgrounds.  It could have been anything.  Would you blame an Asian guy? 
[00:41:30]  Hmm.  Are they part of the triads?  Hate those triads.  Drive those chucks around and shoot you in Grand Theft Auto.  Pretty difficult.  My wallet's gone.  Nothing worse than losing your wallet.  This actually happened to us in Philly.  Having lunch with the in-laws.  My girl's bag is on the floor.  Yeah.  And it's a nice place.  Sure.  It's around Rittenhouse Square and all that, right?  We're eating.  And all of a sudden, she was paying for whatever reason, or she had to get her wallet for something. 
[00:42:00]  I forgot.  And she goes, oh my God, my wallet's gone.  I'm like, shut up.  Your wallet's not gone.  We were sitting right here.  How could it be gone?  And like I said, it's a pretty decent lunch place.  And I go, it's got to be in the car.  So we go back to the parking garage, and we go through the car, and that's when we realized, holy shit.  Someone went into your bag and took your fucking wallet without us knowing.  Sneaky ass move.  And there's nothing worse than calling the credit card company to cancel your cards immediately.  Yeah.  And they're just watching purchases fly by the screen. 
[00:42:30]  They work fast, those credit card things.  And they have to tell you, oh, I forgot now.  But all right, they charged $7 in Dunkin' Donuts.  They charged $20 a year.  And they're reading off all the charges that happened in the last 15 minutes.  And it's all within the area that we're still in.  And they're like, oh, there goes another one.  They just bought sneakers at this joint.  I can't stand that shit because it just seems like there should be something better in place to protect you and your credit cards. 
[00:43:00]  Like so some guy can't just get it.  And they never check the signature on the back or anything.  I was in a Best Buy over the weekend.  And just because I know they never check signatures, I just drew a cock like where you're supposed to sign.  Did you really?  And I took my new Bluetooth keyboard and walked out.  Shit.  That's great.  They don't even fucking take two seconds. 
[00:43:30]  That's great.  Oh, that's funny.  God damn.  You know, you got to get to the credit card company before the thieves start charging.  So it's a race against time.  And in this case, I believe it was like 10 or 12 places they were able to nail before we realized.  I mean, they worked quick.  But another thing is going on where I yell and scream at the credit card companies because obviously I'm having a baby, right?  I'm coming home from Jersey really late one night.  And we go into, was it a Target?  I think it was a Target, right? 
[00:44:00]  I think it was Target.  I never shop at Target.  But we stopped there for, I forgot what, for what reason.  And we'd charge about a couple hundred dollars.  And I pull out my credit card.  Oh, your card's being denied.  And the reason it was denied, because I had to get on the phone with a dummy.  They're like, yeah, we study your history.  And you've never shopped at a Kmart before.  And it's in Jersey.  And it's late at night.  So we decided this can't possibly be you.  And we stopped the charges.  Now, that's them doing the right thing for you, right? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  But I was so fucking pissed.  I'm yelling and screaming, what do you mean you don't think I would shop at Target?  I'm having an argument with them, even though they're doing right by me.  Because now I had to get back online after they go, okay, now you can charge your stuff.  How about I don't charge 80 things in like 10 minutes?  Right.  That would be.  How about that one?  Right.  I've never done that.  So maybe you ought to check that out instead of me maybe deciding I'm driving by a Target and need something.  And it happened recently, too, because I had to buy a whole bunch of baby stuff at one of these baby joints. 
[00:45:00]  Same thing.  They wouldn't let me use my credit card.  I got them on the phone.  I'm like, yeah, you've never bought baby stuff before.  I'm like, well, guess what?  I'm having a fucking baby.  Figure it out.  Dude, they know everything about you.  Big brother, man.  But my point is I should be nice to them because they are looking out for me and my credit cards.  They're looking out for themselves.  But now I'm annoyed because, you know, it inconvenienced me because I was ready to get out of the store.  And now I have to deal with phone calls and being put on hold. 
[00:45:30]  And this call is going to be recorded and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And it also made you look like, you know, it's embarrassing.  It's like, all right, man, don't tell anyone I'm at Kmart.  Come on.  Come on.  A good night or whatever the credit cards turned down.  What am I here?  Right.  Come on.  Let me say hi to David in Texas.  David.  Hey there, Dave.  Yes, sir.  Good morning, David.  Good morning, gentlemen. 
[00:46:00]  Went to the gym.  The lock was jimmied on my rocker.  They got my billfold.  I found it within about two hours, less than an hour.  I called.  They had laid about $2,000 on three or four cards at various stores.  And they were saying they didn't take all my cards, but they took some.  I guess they thought that I maybe wouldn't miss them at all.  Right.  But they buy gift certificates. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, man.  It's one thing they do for cash.  Sure.  They lost their talk.  So, you know, you can kind of figure it out.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the gym is the worst place.  Thieves are working gyms like crazy.  They love their gyms, man.  Because a lot of us just assume, ah, throw our jeans in the fucking locker.  Everyone's trustworthy, right?  You know, wrong.  Right.  You don't have an actual lock.  You're just using an empty locker real quick.  Right.  So you're going to work out in. 
[00:47:00]  Thank you, David.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See, Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How's it going?  Pretty good, buddy.  So, yeah, I was driving from New Jersey to Arizona going out to college my freshman year.  And using my one credit card to fill up at every station throughout the way.  It's in the middle of Texas and practically nowhere.  And my card wouldn't work.  And, of course, middle of Texas, there's no cell phone reception. 
[00:47:30]  So I had to call my credit card company on a pay phone because they thought it was stolen.  To get it reactivated so I could pay for my gas.  Yeah.  See, because they study your patterns.  I mean, I guess we should be happy about this.  But in the end, you're inconvenienced.  Because now you're like, I've got to find a fucking pay phone in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I was glad they did it.  Because they made absolute sense as to why they would.  And I guess they said next time, if you ever do that, you ever travel, just call them.  Let them know where you're going to be. 
[00:48:00]  Let them know.  Time period.  Right.  Fuck you.  I mean, I work for a bank, too.  And, like, if people go overseas or on vacation and they don't notify our ATM department and they use their Visa check cards,  so a red flag will come up and we'll block it just because there's so much international transactions going on and stuff.  Yeah.  I guess we should be thankful, but I don't know.  Thank you, sir.  It should put the burden on things.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, brother.  Let's go to Steve, the trucker.  Steve.  What's up, boys? 
[00:48:30]  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver, and it's a pain in the ass because I get my car shut off anywhere from three to five times a week  because I live in Indiana, and if they see me using my car in Kentucky because I'm on the road, shut it off.  If I'm in Florida, they shut it off because I live in Indiana.  But shouldn't that be your pattern, and they should understand?  They should have a program where, like, all right, this is this guy's pattern.  He's obviously traveling around.  It's one of the customer service things. 
[00:49:00]  I always tell them, look, I'm a truck driver, but you talk to a different person every time.  All right, boys.  Later.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jack in Cleveland.  Let's not forget, Robert Kelly is going to be at the Improv all weekend starting tonight up there in Cleveland.  Yes, very funny man.  Help out our pal.  Jack, what do you got?  Yeah, I don't think you have to feel sorry for them at all.  They're only covering their ass.  They're only liable for the first 50 bucks.  After that, they're liable.  So that's why they're stopping your transaction so that you don't overspend over the 50. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, so they're not really taking care of you.  They're covering their own asses by doing this.  They're covering their own ass.  The same thing happened when gas was high and people started using their Visa cards at the pump and it was over $50.  Suddenly, they started making you put in your zip code.  That's to protect you.  Bullshit.  You know, when they started that zip code thing, I didn't know my zip code and it was the biggest fucking problem ever.  You didn't know your zip code?  I had no idea. 
[00:50:00]  You should draw it right inside your coat so you remember.  Put it in your shoe.  I have to look it up every time.  Yeah.  Well, because my bills go somewhere else.  Let's just put it that way.  So I was punching in the zip code of where I live and they kept denying the car.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And then realized it had to be the billing address for the credit card.  Yeah.  And then they're suspicious because it's an LA fucking zip code and you're in fucking Long Island.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Buying gas and leave me alone.  Just leave me the fuck alone. 
[00:50:30]  I'm trying to spend money without pulling out cash.  That's what I do.  That zip code tripped me up though, man.  The first few times I'm like, fuck, what's my...  Because I didn't understand it was the billing address.  So I kept punching it in and then I'm punching in old zip codes from when I lived in Huntington.  And all right, maybe the Boston zip code will work.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  Finally figured it out.  But the first few times it was not good.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dave in New Orleans, right, Dave?  You're right.  What do you got, buddy? 
[00:51:00]  Hey, guys.  I have my wallet stolen when I was in the gym one time.  And just like y'all were saying, I called the credit card company as soon as I realized it.  Actually, American Express hooked me up because the lady told me where they were making the charges.  Hopped in the truck, called the cops, found these guys, and wound up getting them arrested that night  and getting most of my stuff back, including the cell phone and other stuff they took.  Wow, solid.  That's rare that that happens, that you actually catch the guy, man.  Yeah.  Very good. 
[00:51:30]  Made me a big fan of American Express, I'll tell you that.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, of course.  I think American Express does a pretty damn good job with their theft department.  Absolutely.  Yeah, they really don't take many chances.  No.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Gift cards.  Yeah.  We're learning that.  Credit card thieves are infamous for buying gift cards and shit.  Yeah.  What happened?  I don't know.  Apparently, I got no sound here, but I'll screw them.  Happens.  All right.  I mean, we don't have to continue with this. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  A lot of people have stories on this one, though.  Yeah.  I got blacklisted by my credit card company for traveling.  For what?  You want any more of these calls, or did we do it, Ant?  Yeah, I think we covered the credit card shenanigans.  Another thing I didn't realize we were going to do today.  We just make this shit up as we go.  Ah, you go along and stuff.  I guess after the break, we can talk about new purchase.  You got a new purchase?  Yeah.  Gee, I wonder what it was. 
[00:52:30]  I was going to say, what gun did you get?  It has to be a gun.  Do you buy anything else besides guns?  Cars.  You bought a car?  No, no, no.  I do that.  You haven't bought a car in a while, right?  No, it's just because of Garage Space, believe me.  I would be one of the worst motherfuckers.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I would love to get a DeLorean.  That would just be fun to drive around.  No, I made a purchase, but I wasn't the only one that made a purchase. 
[00:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's go to break with that tease.  Another purchase was made.  Yes, indeed.  Matching guns again.  All right, all right.  We'll find out after the break.  And also, Larry King, this guy is talking about how he was fucking Larry King's wife in Larry's house.  Let's go to Omaha, Nebraska for our call.  Are you fucking my wife?  He just looks into the camera and yells every so often to make sure. 
[00:53:30]  And lose your heart on.  You know that baseball play we talked about?  I've seen it 20 times since we mentioned it on our TVs here in studio.  Also, we got Metallica.  How do you say this, Danny?  Metallica.  Metallica.  That's right.  Metallica's coming in today.  They play the Beatles and Metallica at the same time.  Yeah.  I've heard their stuff before.  It's pretty fun.  Which one can we play?  I want a little taste here. 
[00:54:00]  Taste.  We could play The Battery of James and Yoko.  Masterful Mystery Tour.  Fuel on the Hill.  Danny's the big Metallica fan.  Yeah.  But pick one where a large audience might enjoy it.  Yeah, I mean, I haven't heard these particular tracks in a while.  All right.  And I'm Evil.  Everybody's got a ticket to ride except for me and my lightning.  That could be good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Running for Your Life.  The Thing That Should Not Let It Be.  Hero of the Day Tripper. 
[00:54:30]  Got to get you trapped under ice.  I'll just bleed your face.  I want to choke your band.  Tomorrow never comes.  How about we do Everybody's Got a Ticket to Ride except for me and my lightning?  Go for it.  Do that one.  I don't know.  Let's give it a try.  Just try this out.  They're going to be playing their stuff live in studio today.  So maybe we should have listened to their CD before we booked them.  That's cool.  Let's do it. 
[00:55:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  All right.  You ready?  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on, it's such a joy  Come on, you metal boy  Come on, let's make it easy  Come on, let's make it sleazy  Make it easy 
[00:55:30]  Make it sleazy  Everybody's got a ticket to us  Except for me and my lightning  Your inside is out  Your electrodes are red  Elect electrodes are red  Someone's controlling me  Can't be happening to me  Come on, let's make it easy  Come on, let's make it sleazy  Take it easy  Make it fucking sleazy 
[00:56:00]  Everybody's got a ticket to us  Except for me and my lightning  Well, a lot of people are saying  we picked the wrong track  For Pete, uh...  Oh, yeah?  How do you even say it?  Betalica?  Yeah  We got Betalica coming in today  And there's some Betalica fans out there  And they're really excited  And they're like, ah, man 
[00:56:30]  You blew it  You played the wrong fucking song  Yeah?  Grizz Few writes  Yeah, Betalica talk  Please play  Hey, dude  That's their bread and butter, son  Sorry, I'm just draining some water  Out of my eyes  Drain the vein  Ha, ha, ha  That's what you say  When you're taking a piss  Wow, there's a lot of fucking water in there  That's all right  That'll do it  Ah, wonderful  Um, so they're coming in 
[00:57:00]  And we'll, uh...  I'm sure they're better than the track  That I fucking picked  Out of the blue  And what's the gimmick here?  What's the gimmick?  The gimmick is, uh...  I don't know  You're mashing two fucking bands together, I guess  Is that pretty much it?  The guy sounds like Hetfield  I'll tell you that much  That's pretty cool  Very cool  Man, damn  Speaking of music  Our favorite douche is, uh...  Oh, God  Sting  I was gonna say  That could be so many people 
[00:57:30]  In the music world?  Not really  Who's on our douche list?  Musical douches?  Sting  And I was a big police fan growing up  Yeah  But he just continues to disappoint with his nonsense  Ah  Remember his lute years?  Him and his stupid lute  Who else is on the douche list?  You know what?  I love him but Neil Young  Neil Young was a douche?  The time I saw Neil Young and he decided not to really play any hits  Tommy Lee  Tommy Lee is on the douche list 
[00:58:00]  Gene Simmons  Gene Simmons is on the douche list  Ted Nugent  Uncle Ted?  Well, he's a douche  I'm just reading off of the list here  You're gonna put him on the douche list though?  People are pulling up  And I know we're pissing off a lot of people  But all these people we're mentioning  We like their music  I like  But they did something to us in the past  That put him on the douche list  Ted is in a different douche category  Ted isn't in the he did something that makes us hate him category  He's just a douche  Yeah, he was born in douche  He's douche  He's douche 
[00:58:30]  And I agree with a lot of his, you know, policies and everything like that  But the way he presents him is just douchey  Who else is on the list?  They're saying John Mayer  Nah  He's not douchey to our show  Even though he hasn't come on since he got all, you know, Hollywood  Yeah, nah, he's alright  He was alright by us  Scott Weiland  I'm a huge STP fan  But he's on the douche list  He's a douche  Jimmy?  Steve Carlesi  Steve Carlesi, yes  Stephen Carr  Stephen Carr, yeah 
[00:59:00]  You don't like Scott Weiland anymore?  He's the biggest douche of them all  Wow  No, to me he's a typical coddled rock star  Like, you know, he thinks he's this, like, this bundle of talent whose horseshit should be tolerant  He should have just been fired years ago  Axl Rose  Yes, exactly  I don't want to promote  We never talked to Axl Rose  I know  He's just a douche  These are people that were just douchey to us personally  Yeah, yeah  Scott Weiland, when they made us clear the stage  Uh-huh  So he could walk on stage 
[00:59:30]  Yeah  Guys, you gotta back up  We're not talking the part of the stage where the audience sees  You know, when you host some of these bands  Which we were doing  We were hosting STP  Uh, up there in Boston  So you get a little side stage action  Where you get a nice little seat  You get to check some shit out  But you're completely out of the way of everybody  Yeah  To begin with  And, uh, all of a sudden they're like  No, man, Scott Weiland wants the stage completely clear  Before he, before he goes on stage  So Jimmy and I were out of our fucking minds 
[01:00:00]  We're like, we can't even stand behind this little thing  To watch him walk on stage  Are you kidding?  Stop it  Remember Jimmy?  That was after he blew the show off for an interview  Because he was late  Remember, he was supposed to be interviewed that day  And he didn't come  And that also came after the  After the, uh, I forgot how long it was  At the PNC  When, you know, in between bands  It was an hour to an hour and a half  Because he wasn't ready to go on stage yet  But I think Axl's a big prick, too  Um, just because of the way he treats you  Makes fans way  He doesn't give a fuck about anybody but himself 
[01:00:30]  Fuck him  People are saying, um, Charlie from Drive Shaft  Is, uh, is a douche  Charlie from Drive Shaft  I have no idea  It's Lost  Oh, see?  It's Lost  By the way, Lost had  You won't, everybody  Oh, shut up with your stupid song  Lost had horrible ratings this past Tuesday  Good  Did it?  Lowest ratings ever for the show  I didn't watch it  I watched it on DVR  Now, how do they figure that shit out? 
[01:01:00]  Like, who's DVRing it  And then watching it the next day  Does that show up in the Nielsen's?  How, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  I don't know  That's a very good question  I don't know  Maybe the Nielsen's are set up in such a way  If your household was picked for the Nielsen's  They know if you're DVRing  And they take that into account  I don't know  I watched it  There were some entertaining moments  I thought  You know, two  But, uh, yeah  It's Lost  What are you gonna do?  I'm just waiting for it  I'm just waiting for it to end now  Now you're just waiting  How many left?  It's like when  It's like when Grandpa  It's like when Grandpa's in the hospital 
[01:01:30]  And it's terminal  You just wait for it to end  Now you're just waiting for it to end  I never knew my Grandpa's  You Grampies  Never knew my Grandpa's  I knew one for a little while  One, uh  I had one Grandma  And another lady that was in that  I don't know  I guess she was supposed to be one  But  Precious  Never knew her either  You were the original Precious  You should have been the guy in the movie  No shit  Imagine  Greg  No shit  Greg Opie uses story  Precious 
[01:02:00]  I don't know why we didn't do anything with that audio  Precious  When Precious was a hot movie  We should have went back and  And, uh, pulled some of the Precious on it  And redone Precious  Because I was  Precious  This lady  My mom's mom  This lady  This lady  I guess when I was born  Called me Precious  Yes  And then fast forward  Twenty some odd years  That's the  You know, the next time I saw her  So I guess I wasn't that Precious in her eyes  Were you close to her?  Was I close to her?  Hell fucking no  The best part of the whole Precious thing is that she's dying in a hospital 
[01:02:30]  And the family comes to see her like on her deathbed  No, no  My mom went  Yeah  Even though she didn't have a relationship with her for many years  I don't know how many  Probably  A solid 15 years she didn't have a relationship with her own mother  Yeah  Boy  And my mom decided  Well, she's dying  I should go see her  And she asked the entire family  You gotta remember  I'm one of seven kids  Yes, of course  I was the only one that stepped up  And I don't blame my brothers and sisters for not stepping up 
[01:03:00]  I'm not  It's not one of those things  I just figured  I might as well go with my mom  Give her a little support  No one else wanted to  And I don't blame them  They all hate her?  Yes  This lady was nothing to us  Nothing  Go ahead, sorry  So it was just me and my mom  It just helps the story  Because it wasn't like we all rushed to the hospital room  Realizing, oh boy  We all should do the right thing  Even in death  We didn't give a shit about her  My favorite part, though  Is that as she's dying  Opie was just like  I'm gonna wait in the car  Waited in the car 
[01:03:30]  That was the last word she heard from me  I'll be in the car  Well, because she looked at me at the doorway  Drop dead  She looked at me in the doorway  And now I'm pushing  You know, I know we joke around with ages and stuff here  But I was 25, 26  Yeah  And I'm in the doorway  And she's crippled in her bed  She can't move anymore  Precious  And she gives me this precious  Because she sees me at the doorway  I'm like, ugh, mom, I'll be in the car  Oh, she's calling out for her precious  Do what you gotta do 
[01:04:00]  And then my mom's sister was like  Peeking around a corner down the hall  What a weird fucking family that side is  That is a little odd  Because now she's paranoid that her sister  Who she hasn't seen in  My mom and her sister haven't talked in  How old am I now?  About 30 years  I've never understood that, by the way  Imagine not talking to your brother Joe for 30 years  No  Right, exactly  Crazy  So they haven't seen each other at this point  For, I don't know  Fuck  I don't know  10, 12 years  Something like that 
[01:04:30]  Wow  So my mom is coming to  Say goodbye to her own mother  And now the sister  Who doesn't talk to my mom  Is peaking  Because she was there the whole time  And she got out of the room  And she realized my mom was there  She's peaking?  She was peaking from around a corner  Down the hallway  And now she's all paranoid  That my mom's there  To hopefully inherit money or something  It's like  What?  Just fucking psychotic shit  What the?  What?  Yeah, I got an aunt somewhere in Queens  She was in  She was a cop  She was a NYPD cop 
[01:05:00]  Oh, okay  I don't know  To be honest with you, I don't know  Female cop  Female cop  We're talking in what?  The 60s?  I'm feeling you  60s and the 70s  I'm feeling you  And she's still alive somewhere in Queens  I haven't seen this lady since I was  Fuck, I don't know  14 years old, maybe  And what's the problem with her?  Like that you wouldn't  Or she wouldn't reach out  That's just an odd thing  The family that just doesn't want to know each other 
[01:05:30]  It's kind of weird  I don't know  It goes back to, you know, the Jimmy stuff  It's always some nonsense thing that starts it  And then 30 years later  You're still not talking and stuff  Wow  It's ridiculous  It's ridiculous  It really is  It's exhausting  It's  Like I have no reason to look up this aunt  I don't know her  Yeah  And we're  Well, that's one thing  If you don't know the person  Like why the fuck are you going to jump in  Unless you, you know, find religion or something  And the lady  I don't even call her my grandma on that side  Why would I care? 
[01:06:00]  I mean, she was a douche  She was horrendous  A douche  She was horrible  She was a horrible woman  Grandma's a douche  That's pretty bad  I remember we would  If we told these stories  I should shut up  But I remember going to visit her  With my mom  You know, when we were  Sort of getting along  And I was a tiny little kid  And I swear  We'd go in the backyard  And it was in Queens  So the houses are all close together  Yeah  Her backyard was like a volcano hit it  And everyone else had nice green and plants and colorful shit going on  Oh, she was that one 
[01:06:30]  And hers looked like it was one just solid, horrible, morbid color of death  You think she was a hoarder?  No, she went the other way, I think  Really?  I was, I'm too young  I think she was  Meticulous  Yeah, I think she had extreme OCD  So the house was like perfect  Yeah  And it smelled like mothballs  I remember that  And there's a lot of just old lady shit  Even though she wasn't even old at this point  Mothballs  Doilies and all that crap  And hummels  Old lady house  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Just like antique-y things all around  And just, just, just a smell of depression 
[01:07:00]  Depression and impending death  Death and paneling  Right  And to this day, I hate brick houses because of that  Oh, she's a brick  Really?  Yeah, because she had a brick house  And I, and I remember just like, you know, just knowing that  It was never a good time when I was in that brick house or in the backyard  So to this day, when I see brick houses  It's kind of like vacuum cleaner  Reminds you of  I don't like brick houses, man  And, and even the modern brick they make kind of nice  Yeah, nah 
[01:07:30]  Brings me back to the old school brick  And, and just how horrible that fucking house was  Wow  And how horrible that lady was  Nothing worse than going into old people's houses like that  Because they are all depressing  Why fucking, you know, they just, there's nothing modern or new or, or alive in, in, like, grandma's house  I don't know  It's just a fucking depressing old yuck  It's just healthier for me to, like, ignore that side of my existence and that side of the family 
[01:08:00]  Oh, yeah, I don't know anything about them  Cut your losses and continue with the future family  Yeah, there's not many, there's just not many on that side of the family to begin with  And I don't really want to know any of them  I don't, you know, I don't care  Yeah  And then my dad's, dad's side was just the complete opposite  Amazing, an amazing family  Just amazing  I mean, they had their problems and issues like any family  But in general, very healthy and very loving  And so it's weird  It's a weird combination to have in your, in your body  I'm closer to my mom's side of the family than I am to the people from my dad's side of the family 
[01:08:30]  But it has nothing to do with, I think it just had to do with distance  Like when we moved out to Long Island as little children  Right  My mom's family lived out here on the island  And my father's family all lived in the city  Like Queens or shit like that  Which was, you know, considered the city  Sure  And it was just easier to go over there  And hang out with them growing up than it was to go into Queens  So we see them around Christmas time and everything  Right  So I definitely have a closer relationship with my mom's side of the family than my father's 
[01:09:00]  Right  But I still see them occasionally  You know, we'll all get together at a bar event or something like that  And all the cousins will get on Facebook and stuff  And go, hey, we're getting together in here  And we'll have a fucking great time  Yeah, there's no issues  No, no  It was just more of a distance thing  Right  By the way, thank you, Jordan  He writes, that's weird that her OCD didn't extend to keeping her garden nice  I don't, it was just a, I don't know what it was  It was just like, it was just horrible  Minefield  Just a lot of dirt  Maybe she had a minefield for you  I remember a lot of dirt and paths and like, uh 
[01:09:30]  Remember like, was it the Addams family that had that weird backyard  That it was all like the rough looking, uh, trees and the rough looking  Thistle-y looking things  Yeah, exactly  Hard-packed dirt  That's what I remember the backyard looking like  And it's something else I don't like to this day  Bird baths  No, you don't like the bird bath?  Ew  What's wrong with the bird bath, Opie?  Ew  What's your problem with the bird bath?  Because there was just one lousy bird bath  Why don't you lay down over there and tell us about the bird bath?  Trust me, I got my session in about seven hours from right now 
[01:10:00]  So maybe I'll discuss the bird bath today  Who touched you in the bird bath?  Yeah  Did it turn into a Greggie bath?  No, I don't like bird baths  No?  She had one big, like, fucking, like, cement bird bath  It was just an ugly bird bath in the backyard  Isn't it adorable watching birds, though, take little baths in the water?  They just go  And water goes all over the place  And they shake their head  They could dry themselves 
[01:10:30]  And they pluck at their feathers  And then they fly away  They could dry themselves within half a second  And just  And they give each other  They give themselves sand baths  Yeah  You ever see when they just go in the dirt and the dust and go  And then they take off  It's adorable  Why do they do that in the dirt?  I don't know  It has something to do with their feathers, though  Like, they need that  I think they're trying to rub  Or something  I think they're trying to rub their little  They're trying to rub their  They're trying to rub their little bird penises  Do it  On the dirt 
[01:11:00]  Look at them drinking  See, that's an art  Their heads go down so quickly  Oh, they're so fast  They're panicked about people hurting them  Look at that stupid bird  They're panicking that someone's gonna chop their head off while they're under the water  How about you relax and take a nice drink of water, you fucking bird  He can't  Look at this  He's prey  Look at this thing  He's fucking prey  He can't  It must suck being prey  He's trying to drink it  He's thinking  Don't kill me  Don't kill me  Don't kill me, drink  Don't kill me 
[01:11:30]  Ah, don't kill me  Take your time, you fucking bird asshole  Shit, is that funny, man  Look at this  He can't  He's gotta look  He's constantly looking  Take a bad look  Yeah  What a nervous Nelly that bird is  Oh, can we talk about schizoanimals  Let's make a short list of schizoanimals  I can't fucking relax  Chihuahuas  Chihuahuas are fucking insane little dogs  They can't relax  They're shaking all the time  Yeah  And they look at you with the big eyes like  And they're just horrified 
[01:12:00]  Fucking  Fucking chihuahuas  Fucking squirrels can't relax  Squirrels are twitchy, insane  Birds can't fucking relax  Squirrels' tails  Always twitching  They are little twitchy animals  Schizo motherfuckers  Relax for a second  Enjoy your fucking existence  Rabbits aren't like that, are they?  Rabbits, oh yeah  Rabbits are pretty  Rabbits look like they want to just hang out  Until you get too close to them  Like they're just sitting there  Doing that chew thing 
[01:12:30]  They're always chewing something  Like Steve  That's not  And then they just dart off  That's not chewing  They're just mouthing  When should I run?  When should I run?  I should run now  When should I run?  When should I run?  Should I run now?  Should I run now?  Chihuahuas, you're right  Jimmy describes  Point blank there is saying  Jimmy describes bunnies perfectly  They have an autistic look  Did you ever say that?  Maybe I did  I don't remember  They just sit there  Kind of staring  Chewing  I despise bunnies 
[01:13:00]  You don't like little bunnies?  No, because their hearts are very weak  You're like, hey rabbit  Huh?  Dead  Keels over  So annoying  Trying to get to know a rabbit  You know what the best thing to do is?  It's like, you fucking relax  Let me pet you  You fucking freak  And there really is  That's true  There's so much space  Between their little peepers  Their eyes could not be further apart  That's a great place for a bullet  That's to be able to look  To make sure no one's coming from any direction  Relax a little bit  Don't care this shit about you that much 
[01:13:30]  Predators eyes look forward  And prey look sideways  For the most part  And that's why they are such prey  They are such fucking prey  And it is for that reason  So they can kind of look around a lot  And predators are fixated  Like an eagle  Is like fucking  They're just fixated on  On what they're going for  A willful boy's got one  Deer  Oh my god  And then he writes  Everything sounds like a gun cocking  To a deer  That's true  Yeah, you just take a step  And they just freak out 
[01:14:00]  Whatever they're doing  They will look up  And look right at  Whatever the sound is  And run away  And the sound is not  It could be just you chewing gum  Anything  Yes  Anything  Yes  Deer  You know what really  You know what scares a rabbit a lot  When they're in their little metal cage  On a table  If you take the legs of the table  Out with a bowling ball  The thud  And the collapse of the cage  You've never seen a scared rabbit  He'd be so frightened  All the way down  Fucking panicked  And if you could hop 
[01:14:30]  And run that fast  Why would you panic as much  As they do  Get away from anything  That is a frightened little animal  Deers are very frightened  Very scared  Very scared  The deer  Out on Long Island  There's a big deer problem  They'd go into people's backyards  And just start eating shit  And then  Danny just pulled up a video  Of a deer eating out of a bird feeder  And then he got scared  And his antlers tangled in the bird feeder  And he ran off with the bird feeder  Tangled in his antlers  Jesus 
[01:15:00]  And you know  He doesn't have a thumb  He can't get that shit off  No, he's fucked  Every so often  You hear about the deer  With the arrow in its head  Because it goes right through the bone  And the antler  At the base of the antlers  And then he's just got to walk around  Like fucking Steve Martin  Back in the 70s  He's got to walk around  Like an asshole  For most of his life  Oh, all the other deer  Are laughing at him  Of course they are  He's doing the king tut  Yeah  Hey, here comes jerk off  Fucking deer  He's got a bleeding arrow  In his head  Jerk off 
[01:15:30]  Oh, the fainting goats  Oh, they're scared  If we're going to talk about  Scared animals  The stupid fainting goats  Like Black Earl  That's got to be a nightmare  To fucking live your life  Like, I'm scared  I'll just roll over on my back  That's great survival instinct  Isn't it?  Right  Where you just roll over  On your back  Put your legs straight up  And hope for the best  And have your belly exposed  Yeah  You know, that's the first  Fucking place  They're going to start chewing  The most vulnerable part of you  Is exposed  So anything could just  Rip out your fucking guts 
[01:16:00]  Yeah  Disembowel you  Let's say I do  All right  Chris in the Poconos  How's Chris?  Yeah, rabbits are the worst  There's a scene in life  Where this rabbit's being chased  By this little weasel thing  And they're running past  Other rabbits  That aren't doing shit  They're just standing there  Watching their friend  About to get eaten  And they just stand there  I gotta watch that life  Everyone's talking about that life  And they had the  What, the final episode  A day or two ago, right?  Yeah  What, would they have primates? 
[01:16:30]  They sure did  That was  The primates was the last episode  On life  There's, uh  Just  It was one of them  Striking similarities  To humans, right?  I'd say so  Yeah  It is amazing  Just to watch  Primates and humans?  Oh my god  Just the class systems  That they form  And how they behave  And treat each other  Yeah  And treat their, uh  Their women  Like they really  The head muckety-muck  Primate  Will, um  Gather up his  His women  His bitches 
[01:17:00]  And, uh  Apparently  When bitches get out of line  Yeah, when they get out of line  Someone, you know  The head pimp  Needs to lay the smack down  And he lays the fucking smack down  By biting him in the neck  Yep  And, uh  And they fucking know  Female, uh  Is screaming in pain  And the lead male  Will not let up  Until she's learned her lesson  She's gotta learn  The silverback, right?  No, I forget what  I forget what kind of monkeys  These were  They weren't gorillas  They weren't gorillas  That's amazing 
[01:17:30]  What a bell can do  Well, it's just  It's true  I mean  Yes, it is  Gorillas are one kind  Yeah  They're very, very dangerous  And to be avoided  Very  Mm-hmm  But, uh  I didn't realize  That those  That those monkeys  Treated their  Females improperly  Oh, it's terrible  They did  Yeah  Well, it's not so much improperly  They just need to be put in line  They put them in line  Yeah  And then, uh  What was that other one 
[01:18:00]  Where there was like a bouncer?  Yeah  There's a certain type of monkey  They live in the cold  And when they  When they find like a hot spring  They go and they go, you know  And relax into this hot spring  But it goes by a class system  So if  If you're part of the lower class  Of this family of monkeys  Then you don't get to go in  So it's only the upper crust  Gets to go into this hot spring  And they actually had  A male guarding it  Like a bouncer  And if you  If a monkey from a lower class  Tried to get into this hot spring  He would chase them away 
[01:18:30]  What  What's a class?  Is it based on  Family?  Uh  Yeah, I think  Yeah, it's based on family  And uh  Just relationship with the lead male  Wow  Fucked up  Hot spring must be nice  Oh, look at how  Look at how relaxed  These stupid red-faced monkeys are  They're  They're in the hot spring  Just kinda  He looks like he's been  In the hot spring too long  With the red face  Yeah, he looks cooked  But their little whiskers  Are frozen, right?  Yeah  That's some cold shit  But the hot spring 
[01:19:00]  Must be so nice  Look how cute  Have you ever been in a hot spring?  Yeah  You're cute  You have?  Yeah  Out in California  It's pretty cool  But the only problem is though  When you get out  Your fur's all fucking frozen  Yeah  They don't seem to  Wow, look at this  The hot  I went to uh  I went to some hot springs  Outside Seattle  Yeah  When I was visiting  John O'Brien  Many years ago  Cold there sometimes  So uh  Oh fuck yeah  It was cold when he got out  But you know  Or uh  Whatever  I know what you're gonna say 
[01:19:30]  Ugh  Ugh  What, memories?  Yeah  Memories of people gone by?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Our girls at the time  Were really annoyed  That we wanted to go  In the hot springs  Oh relax  Why?  Well, because there might have been  A few naked girls  In the hot springs  Oh, perish the thought  Your dick slips in one  Ooh  But you know what  Oh, look how cute  Isn't he cute?  That was a bonus  That there were girls  In the hot springs  Obviously  But also it's like  It's fucking hot springs  And I've never done this before 
[01:20:00]  You wanna try new things, right?  Yeah  And they're all annoyed  As we're fucking stripped down  To go in the hot springs  Oh Christ  And they're sitting on a fucking log  With their arms crossed  All pissed  As we're in the hot springs  Like, what are you fucking  Then go find a fucking  Gap and go shop or something  Gap by the hot springs  Even though we're in a rainforest  Yeah, you're in a rainforest  Go fucking take a walk  There probably is one, though  Is that one of the bouncers?  Huh?  No, no  This is the lower class monkeys  Oh, they can't get in  That aren't allowed  Aw  This 
[01:20:30]  Before  When we were watching the video here  One of them got chased out  By the bouncer monkey  And then it cuts to  Just the herb scrub monkeys  The section 8 monkeys  That can't go in the hot springs  I can't go in  That sucks  To try to get some hot water  I know  It really is amazing to watch, though  The  That they have a society  And culture  And everything like that  Scrub monkeys  Oh, poor scrub monkeys  Look at them  They can't go in the hot springs 
[01:21:00]  They're all cold and shit  Oh, that sucks  The little ones are all sad  Come on, let them in  How miserable  There's a velvet rope there  Look at the privileged monkey  Fucking  Yeah  Just enjoying some hot water  In the narration  They say that  That child monkey  Will never know  How good they have it  Wow  Because  Spoiled little brat monkey  Gets born into the class  Just like everybody else does  That's amazing  We're really not making statements  About monkeys  We're making statements  About people  And how we're not much different 
[01:21:30]  Exactly  We think like  Wow, monkeys are dicks  But it's like  Wow, we really are  Fucking primitive  We do the same shit  We're primitive  We do the same shit  As nature does, man  It's like  Yeah, we like to look and go  Oh my god  They're so human-like  It's like  No, we're pretty monkey-like  Yeah, that's what I mean  You know  We're pretty fucking terrible  I know  We should just throw shit  At each other  We do, don't we?  A bunch of hard-ons  We kind of do  Jimmy, have you ever been  In a hot spring?  I would love to  If it wasn't for my  Fat stomach and tits  It don't matter  You just go in the hot springs  And enjoy 
[01:22:00]  I'd like to, yeah  Pretty amazing shit  You went into the pool  In L.A.  Remember that time?  That's true  And you were trying to  Pick up the girl  That was good  And you were interrogating her  That was one of the best  I actually got to sit  And watch Jimmy's game  It's not good, is it?  It was so funny  It's a funny game  Dude, it was  It was an interrogation  It was like  There was so many questions  Being asked of this girl  I didn't know what else to do  I know  I wouldn't have either  To tell you the truth 
[01:22:30]  That was  She was on  Tough Nut to Crack  Yeah  So where are you from?  What do you do?  Do you like it?  Yeah  How much time?  And she really wasn't  Giving you much  You could work with  I had respect for you  That night  But I was just going  Oh no  Oh this is not  Going to go well  For Jimmy  I said  Why are you in L.A.?  She said  I'm here to go  To a rape crisis center  There's nowhere to go  With that  Fighting baboons  That's a baboon  That had to get his bitch in line  Oh shit  She stepped out of line 
[01:23:00]  She stepped out of line  He had to correct her  They look like they were  In big fur coats  The males  With their hineys showing  Wow man  Cut out  Yeah the males got like  Massive fucking  Upper bodies  Would you want to deal  With a baboon?  No  Fuck no  Those things are  Fucking ruthless  They're very nasty  Look at those things  That looks like something  From fucking caveman times  It's amazing  There's a whole fucking  Pack of them  Just walking around  How big are they?  Would you try to ride  A baboon?  No 
[01:23:30]  You know how unhappy  They'd be  Oh he would not be  You think that would be  A problem  But I mean  Their fangs are retarded  But their fur is  Is in such a way  That it looks like  It's a perfect place  To sit for a ride  You think?  Yeah  Look how mean it looks  And they got giant fangs  When you ever see  One of those things yawn  Yeah  Holy shit  Must be when the  The rich Voss baboon  Is talking  And they all have  Horrible male pattern  Baldness  On their assholes  On their assholes 
[01:24:00]  Yeah what is with  The bare fucking  Red mandrel ass  It's pressure to get  Logs caught in the things  They're trying to be cute  In the hot springs  They got fucking  Little shit balls floating  Washing their ass  Maybe that's why  It's not so hairy  So the fucking shit  Just falls  And doesn't get all  Matted in their assholes  Yeah  It's probably  Alright  We didn't even explain  Why Sting is a douche  This time around  That's how we started  Is it new doucheyness  From Sting  Or is it old doucheyness  Well  Sting after many many years  Finally said 
[01:24:30]  Okay what the hell  I'll do a police reunion  Remember  He didn't want to do that  For many many years  No  And they do it  And it was  Massively successful  It was one of the biggest tours  A couple years ago  I guess at this point  So you would think  Okay why don't you do that again  That would be nice  A lot of people probably  Still haven't seen  The police back together  And they  I went  And they sounded great  Right  Yeah  No Sting has decided  Fuck all that  I'm done with that already  And he's doing a symphony tour  Ah  Where he's going to play  Police and solo songs 
[01:25:00]  Reworked by an orchestra  This time  Oh  And what does he do  Is he going to sing  With the orchestra  Or is he going to conduct  Of course he'll sing  Do we have any  Any Sting doing the lute  The police song lute though  Is this the  Lute  Oh this one  This stinks 
[01:25:30]  You know how embarrassing  This is  Being a police fan  To talk  With me again  I just hated the story  Around every song  Didn't you go with me  I did  If I had an ounce  Of moral courage  I would have made a noise  Ah  You know  Remember Lee Abrams  And Eric Logan  Were looking at you and I  Going please don't do  What you're thinking  Yes  Because me and Jimmy 
[01:26:00]  You were invited to  But Ant's not a  Sting or police fan  We were invited to  Like a  What  Like a  It was a performance  At Lincoln Center  But it was  It was one of those  Talk things too  They  What  Yeah  Artist Confidential  Right  Alright  Artist Confidential  And it's Sting  With his lute player  And they talked for like  For fucking ever  And then they finally  Start playing songs  And there's only about  50 of us in this  Performance area  Yeah  With Sting  You're like  Fuck this is cool 
[01:26:30]  And then we had to  Listen to this horse shit  We got to meet him beforehand  Like that's when  The company took care of us  Like they liked us  Elo took it  You know  Introduced us  Yeah but I had  I had a problem  Because god forbid  I asked for  Another picture  With Sting  Because the flash  Didn't go off  He got so fucking pissed  Yeah  And all he had to do  Is to  A douche  All he had to do  Is take maybe  Maybe  20 pictures  He  He's  A douche  I  I have to agree  With you  But now he's  You don't like this song 
[01:27:00]  Oh  It's  Ponderous  Do you think it's nice  It's like tranquilizers  It's horrid  All the night  All the night  My sleeps  Are full  Of dreams  This is the same guy  That did Spirits  In the Material World  And  I'm actually kind of  Liking this  Shut up  No no  This is the only song  Of the Lute stuff  That I liked  No this is the one  We make fun of  The most though  Well it was 
[01:27:30]  Crack that Lute  Over his head  Like El Cabong  Mike Blackwell  From Houston  I gave my love  A cherry  That had no store  I get  Well could you play  The interpretation  Of the police song  He did with the Lute  Do you have that  In the system Travis  Because that's what  Really annoyed us  Yeah the other one  I have is  Message in a bottle  Yeah listen to this  Listen to this  With the Lute  Thank you 
[01:28:00]  You like the sand  No  The Lute  There's a reason  Only four people  In the world  Play it  Gerard Depardieu  Was his  Lutist  Lohutist  He looked like him  Remember  Yeah  There's a reason  Why this instrument  Is pretty much  Extinct at this point  Right 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  There is a reason  People came up  With something called  The guitar  The guitar  The guitar  Yes  And they figured out  How to properly  This was the bone  He threw the audience  Yeah  Like alright  I'll give you one  Here you go fuckers  I think he gave us this one  And maybe one other  Here you go  So disappointed  In the sting  So he's doing an orchestra thing  In the same vein of the music  And how people are douchey 
[01:29:00]  And how fucking up shit  Green Day's musical  Apparently  Whoa  Not getting good reviews  Horrible reviews  Not getting good reviews  Yeah  It's a punk musical  On Broadway  No better way  To really cement  Your  Your  Your image  In punkdom  Than  Putting it on Broadway  I  I think it was lazy  On Green Day's part  They should have  Fucking put their  Put themselves 
[01:29:30]  In the show  But that would have just been  Green Day  In concert  Live  In concert on Broadway  So what's the difference  Between Green Day  In concert  This is a story  Man  What's this  It's the story  It's the story  Of punk  And how people felt  And man  You're the oppressed  By the man  Man  It's a bunch  Of horse shit  What's the story  Does anyone know  Uh no  What is the story  Do we have a synopsis  Do we have a review  That we can look at  American Idiot  Oh thank you  Trap Dog  This is Trap Dog 
[01:30:00]  Everybody  American Idiot  Was a concept album  So like  Was it  Yeah it told a story  Is there anything  Hold on hold on  Is there anything worse  Than the concept  Album  Jimmy  Loves the concept album  You're a big fan  Of the concept album  He loves things  Like Tommy  Uh when the  Who did Tommy  And things like that  No I don't  Wait was American Idiot  About Americans  Being idiots  Or what was it about  No it was about  Yes  Alright  You would think that  But no  What was it about 
[01:30:30]  Travis  It was  Well the album's  Protagonist  The Jesus of  Suburbia  It's his story  Alright  Look  What  Enough  Just enough  Do you want the  Synopsis here  Of what  Yeah give  Of the Broadway show  Yeah it says  For Johnny  The quote  Jesus of suburbia  Oh I'm sorry  I have to go  Somewhere else with this  Hang on hang on  Yeah  To hell  What  He's the everyman  Yeah he's  Oh he's the everyman  Who's the everyman 
[01:31:00]  Alright  Who  I can't believe  I just lost myself  Jesus of suburbia  Is the everyman  He's the everyman  And he's probably  The guy that comes out  On stage  And  Yeah the storyline  Involves  Flips his arms around  Real gaily  And has the microphone  In front of his mouth  And sings Broadway-ish  There's three main characters  All of them  Disaffected suburban youth  As they search for meaning  In their lives  For Johnny  The Jesus of suburbia  The solution is to head  To the big city  Where he finds a girlfriend 
[01:31:30]  But also falls prey  To drug addiction  At the hands of a dealer  I'm going to the city  I'm going to the city  I found a girl  We're going to the city  Oh shut up  Yeah but you gotta sing it  Like Billy Joe  Oh god  I hate Broadway  It sucks  Stop with your sing talking  It's terrible  It's horrible  It's never sad news  No  We're getting beat up  Because of the concept  Album thing  Because obviously 
[01:32:00]  People are bringing up  Pink Floyd's The Wall  Alright  I like the songs  On the wall  I didn't realize  It was some kind of concept  Who cares about the story  Exactly  What the fuck is the concept  Of that  Exactly  And how many people  Cared about the actual concept  They cared that  There was some good songs  On there  You could like songs  Off a concept album  Without digging  The concept man  I never understood  The concept  I like  The Who's Tommy  But I didn't like it  As a concept  I just like some of the songs  On the double desk  Good  That's it  Right  Exactly  Speaking of Broadway too  Is there anything worse than 
[01:32:30]  I got a good example  But when you go to Broadway  And there's  You know Broadway's got the  A lot of  A lot of  Gies  And they try to man it up  Because the role calls for  Like a manly man  Someone that would like vagina  Now  Our friend Rob Bartlett  Was in The Odd Couple  Yeah  And he was  He really was amazing  I'm not just saying that  Because he's a friend of ours  And he invited us  To see The Odd Couple  Nathan Lane 
[01:33:00]  Was Oscar Madison  Which is ridiculous  And Oscar Madison  We all know  Is like a guy's guy  Oh man  Smoking cigars  Drinking beers  Betting  And fucking  Sports  Nathan Lane  Was so not believable  As Oscar Madison  Fruit in the roll up  It took  It took me right out  Of the fucking play  Yes  And he tried to man it up  He can't man it up  But it's not in his nature  To man it up like that  Of course it's not  Like in Oscar Madison  Of course  Oh god 
[01:33:30]  Broadway  And now  Oh yeah  They've run out of ideas  Because  Oh let's hear the rest of the  Is that the whole synopsis  So he goes to this big city  Tries to make it  Well there's three  On his own  There's three characters  That's one of them  Yeah  Then there's another character  Tunny  Who goes the patriotic route  Enlisting in the army  And he's sent off to Iraq  Only to wind up  With one of his legs blown off  Oh no  That's good  That's what we want to see  I've lost my leg  I've lost my leg 
[01:34:00]  I've lost my leg  I hate when other people sing it  But what will he do with his extra shoe  Musicals fucking blow  The lights will dim  In the hospital room  Set will come spinning out  And he'll be there  I did it  For my  Country 
[01:34:30]  Just in the audience  Fucking snoring  As they look all pensive  Overly dramatic  Stop it  Five little piggies  Broadway sucks at dick  It's terrible  God damn it  That dramatic lighting  All drama  Let's back  Let's back like this scene 
[01:35:00]  For effect  This'll look great  And then  Now there's a  What about the third character  Dan  Well  Will  Will  He stays behind  Quickly finding himself  Struggling to support  A wife and baby  Oh  So I guess it's all  Three of their stories  Kind of  I'm assuming it's like  Intertwined  And then  And then like  And then what  What about the music  Where does the music  Come in man  I'd like to know that  And  Guess we'll just have to see it 
[01:35:30]  Do they fag up  The Green Day songs  Or are they playing them  Like they're supposed to be heard  Are they Broadway-ish  Yeah  Or are they rocking  One of us is gonna have to go  I didn't go see it  Someone's gotta take  A friend of mine  Is a big  Big fan of Green Day  Especially the album  And you know  I said I don't know man  I saw the commercials  It doesn't look like  All that much  And then she was like  Oh you'll see  It'll be good  And then she went to see it  And then got back to me  And she was like  Yeah it was awful  She didn't like it  No  Rick the truck  I don't have time  To take his call  He says  Do you think Green Day  Is a legitimate punk band 
[01:36:00]  That's a very good question  I think they  I think they were popular  Right out of the box  Which kind of goes against  The whole punk concept  Doesn't it  Yeah  No they didn't get popular  Until their third album  So what are you saying  That's the first two albums  They were  Excuse me  Eric Nagel  Is going to see this  Alright good  Are we gonna get  An E-Rock review  On this  When is that happening  Soon I hope  Yeah all I know  Is that he's going to see it  And he's got his  Green Day shirt on today  So maybe he's going today  Yeah  Eric does like to wear shirts 
[01:36:30]  Of what's happening that day  Of course he does  Maybe it is today  Can't wait until he wears  A shirt that says  Suicide  I'm sorry  Let's say hi to  Mike in Hoboken  Mike  Good morning gentlemen  Good morning  My wife wanted to go see  The Addams Family musical  And I noticed that  Nathan Lane  Is supposed to be  Gomez Adams  Yeah 
[01:37:00]  And we all watched  The Addams Family  Gomez always wanted  To fuck his wife  Yeah he was always  Getting turned on  When she spoke French  And he was like  Oh Tish French  And he'd grab her arm  And kiss up  He was like a  He was like a  Like a Latin lover  Like a  You know what I mean  This one's different  He lets Thing give him  Handjobs  As he's blowing  Fucking Uncle Fester  Yeah there's a  Clip of them  On Letterman  And it's just  He doesn't pass it at all  He's more about  Getting having

[01:38:00]  Like things  Not history  Because you know  Even Les Mis  Was a historic thing  That was very successful  On Broadway  But like they'll take  Movies  Make them into  Broadway shows  And this latest one  Is the dumbest thing  I've ever heard of  Oh  It's  Oh here's the  Adam's family  Okay start over  I'll tell you about it  This is Nathan Lane  On Letterman  Yeah  It's the whole cast  Ah the intoxicating spell

[01:41:00]  And a couple concerts  They've put on such a great  Energetic show  I was hoping to see that  On stage  But  It was more like  Watching a high school musical  Than it was  Seeing a good Broadway play  With Green Day's energy  Coming out of it  The cast did a great job  Pretty cool set  And they got the music range right  But then they used  All the same  Kind of hokey  Dushy  Broadway  Trip  Cucksucker  People flying through the air  Ass fucker  It just didn't carry through  I had hope for it  But I don't think it's going to last  No I don't think it's going to last  Turd burglar 
[01:41:30]  Oh is this the  What is this  Dan  What do we got  This is the spot that's running  I don't know  I mean  I doubt it's national  So this is the one that I see  And every time it comes on  I have to either turn away  Or change the channel  Oh it's that douchey  I'm just like  This is for  The Green Day  Yeah American Idiot  Thank you Tom  Alright let's hear this  Yeah man  This spring  Broadway's ready to rock  Don't wanna be an American idiot  That's why I tap out  The Green Day's  American Idiot  Don't want a nation under the new media

[01:46:00]  Give yourself some more dope  Yeah  Ah shit man  Yeah it actually  It looks like he's doing a good job  From what I've seen  In the trailers  Or whatever they are  People are now pissed  Because they have  Green Day tickets  For the Broadway thing  Hey enjoy yourself  Have a fucking pisser  Reach over and hand crank  The guy next to you  Have a blast on Broadway  I've had it with Broadway  It's usually some broad 
[01:46:30]  That drags me there  I think that's why  It's called Broadway  Holy shit  I've always been dragged  To a show  By some broad  We gotta go back to the wall  Because I'm getting  My ass kicked  Yeah  Because I didn't understand  The concept of the wall  Now  What was the concept  Of the wall  By Pink Floyd  Dude if I gotta explain it  To you man  It's way over your head  You have no idea  I have not a clue  And how many times  Have you heard  The songs from the wall  A thousand million  Yeah I don't know  What the concept was  Yeah I don't know 
[01:47:00]  Yeah  But there were some cool  Fucking Pink Floyd songs  On that  Jimmy do you know  The concept of the wall  Yes  Does anyone  A show  No  And if they do  Come on down here  And tell us  There was a problem  Between two neighbors  Where the one neighbor's  Dog kept running  And diuretically shitting  On the patio  Of the other neighbor  Diuretically  So he built a big wall  And so he's going  Oh all in all  There's just some more  Shit on my wall  They changed the  You know what  To make it more radio friendly  You know what  I'm taking on  These fucking asshole  Listeners today 
[01:47:30]  One fucking phone call  Explain to me  The concept of the wall  And if you saw  The wall live  Do you remember it  They were building  A wall the entire show  Man  And by the last song  The wall was complete  Man  But then a giant plane  Came from the back  Of the stadium  And knocked down  The wall  And crashed into  The wall man  And then there was  A flying pig  And the walking hammers  Man of oppression  I don't know 
[01:48:00]  One person associated  With this show  Could you please tell me  The concept of the wall  Let's see  Are you getting  Any answers over there  Of course I am  It's a story of  A tortured rock star  With lots of anxiety  And loss  In his life  And how he can't cope  So he builds a wall  To keep himself safe  From being hurt  And how he uses heroin  To self-medicate  Very good  Thank you  Kurt Love 
[01:48:30]  It is brilliant  That fucking  The songs on that album  Are fucking pretty  Like comfortably numb  Amazing  What a fucking  Brilliant tune  Amazing  But what's with the  Walking hammers  I think this is about drugs  Oh you think  Could be  Yeah  I think it was the  It was the prom song  For the end of the  Comfortably Dumb  Jesus  Alright  What a callback  Comfortably numbskull 
[01:49:00]  Jesus  We got Cassius in Brooklyn  Cassius  Hello boys  Hey  Do you know the concept  Of the wall  I always thought  It was just kind of  Just the old  Saw  Of you know  The individual  Versus  State 
[01:49:30]  State conformity  And uniformity  And the loss  Of you know  Fighting against the loss  Of individualism  I'm sorry  But this proves my point  Concept albums suck  They stink  If there's good songs  On there  They're fine  But yes  Jimmy go ahead  We can't get  No education  How can you have  Any pudding  If you don't  Eat your pennies  Holy shit 
[01:50:00]  That would be great  Holy shit  Let's say hi  To Keith  In Delaware  Keith  Keith  Yo  Hey guys  I think the whole  Concept of the wall  Album starts  With a crazy mom  Taking her young 
[01:50:30]  Boy to the wall  In downtown  London  And show him  The plaque  That his father  Earned for getting  Killed in World War II  And how it fucked up  His life  And how he thought  That was his dad  And that kind of shit  Turned a drug  And all that kind of shit  You got all that  Listening to that out  It's layers  It's layers of stories man  He writes about his father  Too I think  And when the tigers  Broke free  That too  And I like  His father was killed  Some shitty battle  For a bridge  Yeah  Exactly  Steve C  Is going to  Explain the concept 
[01:51:00]  Of the wall  Steve C  Yes  The wall  You build the wall  You put a hole in it  You stick it  And you suck it  Very good  Best explanation  I've ever heard  Wow  Is he fast  With that too  The penis  Crashes through the wall  Yes  And he sucks  All right  Here  All in all  It's just another  Cock through the wall  Yes  Let's say  Hi to Fuzzy  In Connecticut  Fuzzy 
[01:51:30]  What's up  Hey  It's a pretty simple concept  Really  It's just a dude  Growing up in England  During the period of the war  Lost his father  You know  And then just trying to deal  With stardom  An awful wife  And it's not that  Difficult to understand  It's just a story  Yeah  Just like anything else  Stories  Stories  I write stories  Stories  All right  Well  I'm out  Punch it out  Thanks  Kind of makes sense  I just  Can't bash the people  But you know 
[01:52:00]  We're too shallow  Opie  To understand  Such deep thinking  As a concept album  It's bad to admit  That I don't understand  A concept album  I usually don't  I never really cared  Things start getting  A little too deep  In movies and stuff  I start going  Uh oh  A little bell goes off  I go uh oh  I might be confused  I better wrap this up  At the end  Do we have  Metal by Pink Floyd  In the system  Metal  You know the song  Metal  Metal  Metal  No  M-E-D-D-L-E  I think is how  They spell it  You got that Travis  Oh  Travis is looking

[01:53:00]  Like well we can't  Play everything  Cause that's crazy  Even though it's called  Deep Tracks  What the fuck  Maybe it's called  Something else  I think it's called  Metal  It's a great riff  Great fucking Floyd song  The Wall is just about  A Nazi  Is about Nazi Germany  Anthony  Metal is their  Fifth album  It's all about  Interpersonal relationships  Oh yeah  It's all about  Anthony's life  Oh  Well  You do put  Walls up around you  Sounds good  Yes I do

[01:59:00]  Thank you. 
[01:59:30]  Thank you. 
[02:00:00]  Thank you. 
[02:00:30]  Anthony.  Yes.  And I do believe we still need contestants, right? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  What the fuck's going on with this?  We've done cherry darts in the past.  It's a nice party for everybody.  Yeah, we haven't talked about it enough, I think.  But it really is a great time.  Some girls come in, I guess they wear thong, I guess they wear thong, I guess they wear thong, I guess they wear thongs and their boyfriends or whoever they choose tries to throw a cherry at their anus.  Yes, that's the bullseye.  Yes, that's the bullseye.  Which is the bullseye.  And the prize is Stephen Singer has very generously given us a diamond encrusted iPad.  It's got a wow logo on it, diamond encrusted. 
[02:01:30]  And that's the prize if you win.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  It's a great gift.  And we have other prizes and stuff, right?  Yeah, I'm sure we do.  And we're going to have alcohol and drugs, you know, like we usually do.  Of course.  Yeah, there's plenty of ads.  Yes.  And we haven't announced this yet, but the winner gets to take my penis head and nuzzle it against their cheek like a small furry animal.  Ooh.  As one would a ferret.  We need couples, I guess.  Yes, we do.  Danny, are we using you? 
[02:02:00]  Using your email address?  Yeah, if anybody's interested, they can contact me directly at danny at opieandanthony.com, and I will respond to your inquiries.  Okay.  Your query.  Because Iraq was going to pull clips.  We could play some clips for everybody.  Yeah, just to kind of get people pumped up.  So hopefully he could give me a few cherry dart clips.  But Iraq was very negligent in his duty.  He was too busy fucking trying to stretch his Green Day shirt so that it was the neck of a human and the fucking bottom part.  He dresses like the Fat Man and the Elephant Man. 
[02:02:30]  You remember when he took a shower in the rain?  That's the type of shirt.  What type of shirt?  All right, that's the way.  Iraq.  His shirt's a bit small for his body.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  Oh.  I got something for everybody.  I don't even know what this is.  It's never good when they don't label.  God damn it, did I fuck up again?  What happened?  I meant to say shitbag and it's fucking autocorrected.  My Twitter said shotbag.  I hate when that happens.  I'm not a shotbag. 
[02:03:00]  Dude, I fucking hate when that happens.  But it did it once and I fixed it.  Oh, I hate that.  Oh, no, I did it.  I'm sorry.  No, I apologize to me.  It was the other guy's Twitter.  I said I'm a bag of shit with teeth.  But the other guy fucking said you're not a shotbag.  All right, so fuck him.  I apologize.  I turned that shit off.  I don't need them guessing what word I'm typing.  Fuck that.  It helps sometimes, though.  Ah, fuck that.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I'm showing people a picture.  Your big delicious cock.  They needed a picture of somebody that used to come on the site. 
[02:03:30]  That's all.  Oh, all right.  Big delicious cock here.  What the hell's going on then?  Big fat cock.  It's all right.  Don't you hate when people put adjectives before your cock?  Yeah.  I hate that.  Doctors never do that.  Do you mind if I grab a hold of that delicious firm cock?  Juicy.  How come doctors never call your cock plump?  You know, excuse me.  You don't mind.  I'm going to have to check you for a hernia, so I'm going to lift your suckable cock.  You think they would be fired for that? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, boy, would they?  Yeah.  Delicious.  Could you please pull out your delicious suckable plump cock?  Imagine if you pull your dick at me and go, wow, your wife is lucky.  All right, let me tell you for her.  So, Cherry Darts, we need couples.  Yes, we do.  And the prize is a good one.  So, we've got other stuff going on.  So, just fucking sign up and help us out with a fine broadcast that's going down Tuesday.  That would be like the first sexy thing we've done in this fucking studio with listeners.  Yeah.  This studio has been very difficult to get sexy stuff done in. 
[02:04:30]  Well, make this sexy.  It didn't help that they threw us in a box to begin with.  Absolutely, dude.  And said, it's temporary.  We just want to get you over here in our building.  So, you know, just deal with the studio we're giving you.  I'm like, we don't want this studio.  We were forced to take this studio.  Yeah, it would have been nice to have a big studio.  We can't do shit in here.  Well, you wait until this contract is up and the new one comes.  The new studio, I guarantee you, is going to be very, very big. 
[02:05:00]  Because they knew better than what we wanted.  And they had another idea of what we wanted, I guess.  Exactly.  Making the best of it, certainly.  But Jesus Christ.  We have made the best of it.  After all these years in radio, we go back to a tiny studio.  Our studios were getting bigger and bigger year after year.  Now we go back to a tiny fucking place.  That makes sense.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Keep up the good job. 
[02:05:30]  Keep doing what you do down the hall, because I don't know what it is.  Anthony, I got this to play, and it's not labeled.  Which isn't a good...  Oh, shit.  It's not a good sign.  Are you just throwing something cold?  As they say, cold?  I trust the guys.  All right.  And it's not labeled.  Which means this is a doozy.  Oh, boy.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  How old are we? 
[02:06:30]  How old are we?  Never two.  That was one of our guys?  No, that was actually Steve speaking at the staff meeting.  Wow.  That's funny.  Which guy? 
[02:07:00]  If you guys had to guess, who would you think it was?  I would go with you.  I would go with D-Boy.  Why would you go D-Boy?  I would go Danny.  I know the secrets of D-Boy.  And that is one of his deep dark secrets.  That's a fucking, that's a black label alcohol shit.  It's fantastic.  That's the type of shit you take while you're holding a bucket in your lap just in case.  You know that kind of shit where you fucking, you're like, and you piss straight out because  your body arches, that was a fucking horrible shit. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, wow.  That's impressive.  Wow.  His chick must never eat his ass.  That's a, here he is.  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  Wait, what, um, what was, uh, happening there?  Food poisoning, I think.  Wow.  Food poisoning.  What was the food, you think?  Jesus.  I think I made, like, steak, like, the night before.  Yeah.  And I think it was, like, a day old or something, and just fucking.  Just had a little cell of bacteria.  What, did you not cook it?  No, I cooked it all the way through.  I just, just the, you know, I guess. 
[02:08:00]  Did you puke?  No, I just had awful stomach pains for, like, the last two days.  And shit a lot?  Yeah.  There was a lot of, um, uh, buildup there.  A lot of, like, air.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Helping, helping things along.  Yes, yes.  Uh, Bob in California.  Oh, my God.  I was listening to that in my Bluetooth headset while my boss was talking to me about a project  I'm working on.  That's, that's what's great about these apps.  Oh, I know, yeah.  You got the Bluetooth in your ear, like, oh, I'm just waiting for an important call, and you  can listen to the show.  Listen to the show.  What the fuck are you doing?  Looking right at the boss. 
[02:08:30]  Looking at the boss, like, there's nothing, I'm not listening to nothing.  I didn't know that.  I'm just ready for phone calls, boss.  Right, ready for work.  A lot of people are doing that.  They're Bluetooth-ing the motherfucker out of this show.  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah.  Wow.  So a little food poisoning by D-Boy.  Fucking A.  Thought I'd just share that with you guys.  That was D-Boy's opinion of Lionsgate movies, by the way.  Yes.  Absolutely.  He hates them.  That was his impression of them.  Yes, his impression of every Lionsgate movie.  That was really good.  That was a terrible fucking gurgling shit.  I missed a lot, too. 
[02:09:00]  Was there any burning?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, the burn is bad.  See, Derek doesn't really play off his excitement that he shows us to you guys, because when  he recorded that, it was like the first thing.  He's like, you know, he comes running in all excited from the bathroom.  He's like, Derek, Derek, you gotta listen to this.  You gotta listen to this.  Like, it's Christmas.  You hold a phone by your fucking bag?  Yeah, yeah.  The Apple phone is great for, you know, picking shit up.  Oh, right.  Because the mic's right down there.  It just works perfectly. 
[02:09:30]  You gotta watch out.  You drop that in there.  That thing is not coming out.  It's not covered by AppleCare.  Yeah.  Do you want to tell the story about how you pissed on your Xbox headset?  I don't even remember how that happened.  Derek likes bringing his Xbox headset and controller into the bathroom with him.  Right, right.  I've been privy to that one.  Yeah.  And what?  It fell in?  Yeah, like I was taking a leak and I was talking to him and it just fell off and it just went  blank.  Like, you couldn't hear me for the next hour. 
[02:10:00]  Had to dry out.  Right on.  God damn it.  Sticking with the same subject, Rahm Emanuel.  Is that how you say his name?  Yes.  Yeah.  He did this on TV very recently.  Charlie Rose, I believe.  And we don't have an energy policy that keeps our dependence on the Mideast.  And we don't create a new industry here of green technology and green jobs.  Those are the challenges that he's met head on.  And I believe when this year is up, you'll see he's made progress on all four of them. 
[02:10:30]  Democratic Party in trouble in the election coming up.  Yeah, it's got challenges.  They don't even acknowledge it.  They don't even acknowledge it.  How would fucking Charlie Rose not acknowledge that?  Yeah, but that's a good one.  But it threw Charlie Rose off, you hear it?  Yeah, yeah.  They all fell apart.  They both kind of like are a little flustered for a second.  We'll see the end.  We'll see he's made progress on all four of them.  All four of them.  Democratic Party in trouble in the election coming up.  It's got challenges. 
[02:11:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, he got thrown for a loop there.  How would he not address that?  That's so funny.  I don't know.  Wow.  Oh, back to D-Boy's shit before you leave, D-Boy.  A little observation from Dan in Jersey.  Dan, go ahead.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, I heard that shit.  I thought I was listening to Rush, and it was like a Neil Peart drum solo.  It did sound like a drum solo.  There were a bunch of different parts to it and everything.  It's fucking YYZ. 
[02:11:30]  A little build-up and crescendo.  Yeah.  Hey, we've got to get into this Larry King thing.  So we got the Cherry Darts info out.  You gave out the email, right, Danny?  Yeah, let's give it out again.  If you guys are interested out there for playing Cherry Darts, give me a buzz at Danny at Opie  and Anthony dot com.  You know, it's a very festive atmosphere.  It's a lot of fun.  You get a good prize, and it's just fun to be part of the program and hang out.  Yeah, you have to have your calls in by today. 
[02:12:00]  I think it'll be emails by today or tomorrow, preferably.  Yeah, and don't forget, you know, you're going to win one of these modern marvels of technology.  Yes.  An Apple iPad.  An iPad.  Customized with diamonds from Steven Singer.  And bejeweled.  It's bejeweled.  All right.  You know, we're all talk.  It's Earth Day today.  Yeah, I heard that on the way in.  When were we supposed to fuck the Earth today?  When were we supposed to, like, dig holes and just have sex with the Earth?  Oh, we were going to fuck the Earth, right.  Remember?  Remember that bit we were going to start? 
[02:12:30]  Last year, we said that because we missed Earth Day, and then we said, well, we could  do it when we get home and make videos.  You want to make videos?  And put them up on YouTube.  Is it supposed to be rainy?  Because I want a little muddy.  I want to get it in my mind in a nice big mud hole.  Well, if you're going to fuck the Earth, you want it moist.  Yeah, you need it a little muddy.  Yeah, muddy.  Yeah, right in that mud hole.  Well, with all the earthquakes and volcanoes, we ought to just drill a hole and drop a couple  lexaprolin.  The Earth's really freaking out.  Is this hippie Jimmy? 
[02:13:00]  It's just me.  Druggy Jimmy?  Tired Jimmy.  Tired Jimmy?  Yeah, I thought so.  Bombing Jimmy.  Bombing.  Swinging and missing Jimmy.  Poof.  I thought, or they said Earth Day was when it was made.  40 years ago?  Yeah.  40th anniversary today?  Is that true?  People spelt doom and gloom for the Earth well before 2010.  So apparently those dumb hippies were wrong.  Oh, no. 
[02:13:30]  Because everything seems to be pretty hunky-dory.  Yeah, but they brought attention to what we were doing to the Earth.  I don't think they did.  Because of that, the Earth is better.  I think it's just technology got a little better and cleaner and more efficient.  The Earth is more gooder.  More efficient, more gooder than stuff.  That's what I think.  I don't think hippies did anything.  Speaking of Earth.  Stink.  Somebody suggested yesterday on the History Channel, which is the Hitler Channel, but  I actually watched the History Channel yesterday. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, it's the Hitler Channel.  And it had no Hitler stuff.  It had the volcanoes of Iceland.  And one of our fine listeners said, you've got to check that out.  And I did.  And I want to thank that person, wherever you are, for turning me on to that fine show.  You should check it out for yourself.  Too long to get into now, but wow, Iceland is a fucking whacked out place with the volcanoes.  Amazing.  Volcanoes and ice.  Huh?  Volcanoes and ice.  Just...  Yeah.  Well, they explain how...  Wow, man.  ...with the glaciers melting.  Eh. 
[02:14:30]  Eh.  Because the ice is kind of holding back some eruptions, kind of.  A little weight of the ice is keeping everything packed down there.  Kind of keeping everything packed down.  And as the ice continues to melt, they're expecting, I don't know when, I don't know  if it's in our lifetime or not, but just massive eruptions because the ice is not going  to be able to hold it back anymore.  Yeah.  That was one of the things you learned.  I don't think in a thousand years we could pump out as much exhaust as came out of those  fucking volcanoes.  So I don't want to hear it.  Oh, about it?  The Earth pollutes its own fucking atmosphere.  Well, there was an eruption back in 1783 that they basically said caused millions of 
[02:15:00]  deaths around the world.  Yeah.  And caused the French Revolution because now everyone's like, you know, their way of life  is all fucked up.  So basically they're saying it was one of the causes for the war.  Really?  And we had horrible winters three years in a row because of all the sulfuric acid that  was released from this eruption.  See?  And it was like, it was like a red glow.  Wow.  And it was like preventing the sun from warming the Earth to where it wanted to warm the Earth 
[02:15:30]  to, making it very, very, very cold around the world, which caused all sorts of fucking  problems.  Yeah.  And they say that will definitely happen again.  But do you notice Al Gore is not answering any questions about this fucking mess with global  warming?  I know.  This fucking pussy, this pussy is avoiding every reporter that sticks a mic in his fucking  fat face.  Oh, when everybody was buying his shit, he was out there every day.  Wow.  And now that there's been some papers that have come out that scientists were keeping 
[02:16:00]  little secrets that it might not be as bad as they've been saying, Al Gore doesn't want  to fucking talk now.  Yeah.  Why aren't they killing him in the media, man?  Like, he really should be forced to...  Again, whether he's right or wrong, why isn't he at least defending himself?  I mean, like Rahm Emanuel said.  Let me go to Justin in Tampa.  Yeah, it's a very good question, but it's good business for Al Gore.  Al Gore made a lot of money off that crap.  Yes, Justin.  Hey, there was a part of that episode yesterday. 
[02:16:30]  Apparently, there's an island like 20 miles off of Iceland that's less than 40 or 50 years  old.  Yeah, I was telling Anthony about...  I think I got video footage of it actually forming.  Yeah, I was...  So it was pretty cool.  Yeah, I was telling Anthony about that this morning.  So, yeah, the volcanoes of Iceland.  It's really worth watching on the History Channel.  Basically, I think it was 1963.  There was an eruption 20 miles off the coast.  Yeah.  And they watched an island form in front of their eyes.  And I think, obviously, they had to wait a few months.  So it was early 64 at this point. 
[02:17:00]  They actually took boats out there to check out the shit that was coming out of this where  it formed an island.  How big was the island?  Like, big enough to hang out on?  Oh, yeah.  Three feet by two feet.  It's very small.  That's a good island if you want to build a kiosk.  Is that footage online on YouTube?  Sorry, what?  It's the eruption of 1963 in Iceland, I believe.  Yeah, it built an island.  And it's made an actual island 20 miles off the coast.  And they got there and there was already a little man selling trinkets. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  Happy Earth Day.  His name was Ben.  He steered the island around.  Drove it around.  Yeah, it's the lost island.  Ben driving the island around could be the funniest thing you've ever done with a lost, Jimmy.  Oh, he's beeping the horn.  Me, me, me.  He's in traffic.  Hey, are you caught up?  Yeah, I watched, I DVR'd it, so I watched it last night.  That Zoe's lips are fucking terrible.  She stinks.  I can't stand it.  You know what she reminds me of? 
[02:18:00]  Whenever the Sopranos were on and they went to a Melfi scene.  Yes.  A Dr. Melfi scene.  Whenever she pops on the screen, I just go, oh, get off.  You're not interesting.  You're not good to look at.  I hate her voice.  She's terrible.  And she's nothing to this story.  She's nothing.  They could eliminate her immediately and you would not know the difference.  And her acting stinks.  It stinks.  Terrible.  Wow.  That was very primeval.  So a little piece of the eruption, you know, pops above the surface of the... 
[02:18:30]  And made that?  And made that.  Yes.  You could go on YouTube.  Volcanic activity.  The formation of Surtsey, I believe is how you say it.  S-U-R-T-E-Y.  Oh, that's the island right there?  That's the fucking island, 20 miles off the coast of Iceland that they watched form in  1963.  How come they don't show up popping up from the ocean?  They did.  You guys were talking about it.  How come it looks like it's got...  Let me see the beginning of the clip, young Dan.  A lot of erosion on it.  You wouldn't think you'd see that.  The beginning of the clip, a little piece pops up and then the lava just starts fucking  pouring out of this thing and it formed the island. 
[02:19:00]  A little nugget.  And I don't know how big the island is, but it's pretty fucking big, man.  It looks pretty big.  Like, you know, not huge, but...  Oh yeah, that's nothing right there.  You would take a nice bike ride around it.  Not that you would.  It's all lava.  Oh, well, no.  Tires would burn off.  Oh, absolutely.  Very hot.  You stop taking a piss, your feet would be gone.  You need a lot of water.  Oh, wow.  They formed that.  What the fuck?  That nature is fucked up.  Now people go on it or is it still hot?  Oh, no.  They could go on it.  It's still hot.  I don't know.  20 years for a lava.  I know, exactly.  40 years ago. 
[02:19:30]  I'm just laughing because it sounds funny.  40, 46, 7, something like that.  Well, what do they do on the island now?  I don't know.  Probably nothing.  Wow.  Yeah.  It looks like the moon.  Good program to check out, though.  It's on the History Channel.  Yeah.  There's a lot more to it, but.  I have a volcano in my apartment.  Do you?  It's in my closet.  Really?  Yeah.  How do you keep your clothes?  It's got lava on them.  Do you have lava?  Lava stains?  I wonder how close lava gets to you before you have to back up.  I would think it could be pretty far away and you'd be pretty warm. 
[02:20:00]  If you get within 10 feet of lava, you have to back the fuck up.  I would think 10 feet is pretty goddamn close to lava.  That's cool.  Wow.  Look at that.  How fucked up is that?  It's like here.  It's New Island.  Here you go.  Just popping up.  Here you go, peeps.  Fuck.  Nature's going to get us in the end, huh, Ant?  Oh, always.  Always wins.  Nature always wins.  Yeah.  There's a smoking bunch of fucking matter in the water and we're going to wind up living  on it.  That's pretty fucked up. 
[02:20:30]  You know why we don't have ancient civilizations in the United States area or whatever?  Why?  Because that fucking thing in Yellowstone Park was blowing everything up.  That thing blew everybody up?  And then we have to start over?  Yeah.  I think so.  I think it was the big giant meteor that hit off the Yucatan Peninsula.  Why is it that the rest of the world have ancient civilizations that go way the fuck  back and where we live in the United States, we can't go back that far.  Why?  Because they say where life started and then you have where... 
[02:21:00]  But how do we know that?  How do we know that for sure?  Why wouldn't there be life on the entire Earth and then something catastrophic had to happen?  It should be popping up everywhere.  Well, no, because you have the ideal situation and circumstance in one place and that's what  happened.  You think that's what it is?  And apparently it was in Africa.  And then you had the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia.  And then things kind of spread out from there. 
[02:21:30]  You think it's as simple as that?  Yeah, I kind of do.  And then I think that's, you know, that's why we don't really have a...  Why do we only go back to engines?  And they obviously were really stupid.  Yeah.  Because they gave away everything.  So they weren't that smart.  Here's Manhattan for a fucking shiny thing.  Oh, I know.  Smart business.  See that thing you're dragging behind your horse?  How about you put two wheels on it?  Make it a little easier for your horse.  Ted the Indian just gave up Manhattan.  What are you going to give me for this hunk of land? 
[02:22:00]  Do you have a trinket, please?  Something shiny.  Ted the Indian, look, I'm throwing garbage at your feet.  Oh, God.  I'm going to laugh.  Why?  Why are you stopping the commercial shoot?  Oh, wrong emotion.  I'm sorry.  I litter a lot.  They threw me out of the trinket.  I was Ted the Litterer.  A little litter bug. 
[02:22:30]  I was a litter bug.  I love littering.  What do you think of Thanksgiving, Ted the Indian?  I don't like turkeys, Greg.  They make too much noise.  They frighten me.  When I was a baby, they would peck my genitals in the crib.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Uncle Paul would hold the turkey over my genitals.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Let's say hi to Nick in Virginia, Nick.  Nick.  How are you doing, guys, today?  All right, man.  Hi.  Opie, I got an answer for your question. 
[02:23:00]  They would have found fossilized remains of humans, especially after something as catastrophic  as the caldera volcano, because all the ash would have buried the remains.  So there really were no humans in the United States area.  Well, what confuses me is if it's such an ideal place, the United States, right?  It is, right?  It's a wonderful place.  Wonderful climate, wonderful fucking beaches.  Oh, we can grow all kinds of food here. 
[02:23:30]  You got the nice Four Seasons, which a lot of people enjoy, depending on what part of  the fucking country you live in.  We're the chosen people to live here, by the way.  So why didn't anyone else figure it out before we did?  The Indians did.  Yeah, but they were stupid.  We already went over that.  Well, they sent...  Europeans couldn't get here.  There was a lot of water in the way until they had, like, formidable ships.  Humans were able to get to other places.  Yeah, but over land.  All right, maybe there was a little...  And then a few of the...  I believe some of the Indians are the ones that came from Russia very early on, something 
[02:24:00]  like cavemen thing, when it was frozen over Alaska and then into Canada and into the United  States, and then they became the American Indian.  But, you know, how many people...  You're not getting, like, shiploads of people.  You're getting nomadic people.  Nomadic.  That needed to travel for food and to get out of the chilly weather.  Yeah, see, all the continents were connected.  Yeah, we know that.  As one, and they drifted apart.  Yeah, but that was well before fucking... 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, and, well, this guy's saying when they were all connected, our part, it wasn't populated.  Why not?  No, there weren't people on the fucking planet when the continents were together.  I know, but whatever it was that became people, why weren't those things in this area?  It wasn't conducive to everything.  Probably the climate, life...  How was the United States...  How was art part of that fucking...  No one really knows how life just sprouted. 
[02:25:00]  Like, there's evolution and all that, but, you know, this thing grew legs and came out of the water  and fucking turned into a monkey, and then the monkey turns into people and shit like that.  But no one really knows how the fuck that happened.  Thank you.  No one knows, like, exactly how that took place and why the chemistry and the climate and everything  kind of swirled together and made it work.  You're not suspicious, though.  You think the United States was a fucking, you know, come on. 
[02:25:30]  It's a beautiful fucking place.  Wonderland.  Compared to the rest of the world.  It's a wonderland.  And what about the fucking ocean fossil shit that they find in, where is it, Montana?  There's no ocean there.  That's pretty fucked up, too.  Oh, well, there used to be, like, water and stuff all around there.  A lot of things change over time, you know?  But, yeah, I think it's just that's where life formed and then spread out over the globe. 
[02:26:00]  Slowly.  Yeah.  That's why you have things like, you know, ancient civilizations over there in Europe and the Middle East.  And then over here, you just got, like you said, a few engines.  A few engines that gave up everything.  Jesus.  You're not getting, like, the Lucy skeleton in Cleveland.  No.  Well, why not?  You know?  I saw that skeleton.  Did you?  I wanted to kick it over.  Why?  She went, ooh, Ricky.  Yes.  And she held the football and I went to kick it and fell.  Hey, Rick, your wife's a skeleton. 
[02:26:30]  Heart attack while walking in the fucking...  Oh, God.  Where was he?  In Beverly Hills?  I think it was at Hollywood and Vine, wasn't he?  His face first in the sewer.  All right.  This guy's going to explain everything.  Hollywood and clogged vein.  It's a reach.  Jamie in New Mexico.  Jamie.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  Blackwater Draw Site in New Mexico is the first civilization of people in North America. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  And what kind of...  Yes, Jimmy.  That was Anthony.  What kind of people were they?  I have no idea.  I just...  I'm at the Air Force Base out here by it and they always talk about that.  They're claiming...  Air Force Base?  Yeah.  I thought we were playing...  Love you guys.  All right.  Thanks.  Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.  Hate to be a doubting Thomas.  That's doubting Thomas.  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  Do I hate the doubting Thomas?  No.  Oh, I'm kind of a doubting Thomas.  You have to convince me.  Shut up, Thomas.  Exactly.  Oh.  Fucking...  Thomas had great English muffins, but he didn't believe a word anybody said.  Thomas is a cunt.  He doubts everything.  He sure does.  Oh, fuck.  I said, but I could cum all over your muffin and get it in every nook and cranny.  I doubt it.  And then I showed him.  You showed him.  And he ate it.  Did he enjoy it?  Yes.  He became Thomas the Moe. 
[02:28:00]  We can clear the lines.  We don't have to figure out why.  Clear the field.  We don't need to figure out why's today.  No.  We got enough education right there, I think.  Why don't we...  Yeah, because we got Anthony.  He explains it all.  Why don't we...  Of course.  Make love.  Why don't we do the Larry King thing?  Before we get the Beta Talica.  Are they here?  Beta Talica.  Beta Talica's here.  So we got to do our Larry King before we get Beta Talica in.  We have to.  So they're going to have to wait a little bit.  Little Larry.  Huh?  Little Larry. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, so Larry...  Where are we at with this Larry thing, Ant?  Oh my God.  The divorce proceedings between him and his seventh or eighth wife.  Who the fuck knows?  And there's allegations of adultery in the relationship on both parties' parts.  Correct.  Apparently Larry King had something going with his wife's younger sister.  And the wife had something going with the child's baseball coach. 
[02:29:00]  And that guy, who's a very young guy, he's...  I think he's...  I don't know.  I would guess early 30s, something like that.  Oh my God.  And compared to Larry, he was probably really fucking slamming her.  Oh, he was probably smashing her pussy into the bottom of the mattress.  Jeez.  Jimmy, could you compare the two cocks?  Larry King's cock compared to this young...  Wow.  He looks like kind of a Latin guy.  Latin lover.  Uh-oh.  One probably smelled fairly salty due to athletics.  And due to athleticism and exercise.  And how was the other... 
[02:29:30]  Very, very turgid and firm.  I bet you like she would probably just look at this fucking unclipped dick and just like  push it down and watch it snap up and hit his fucking firm belly.  Whereas Larry's, she would tug on it.  And when she tugged it hard enough, his ears would bend.  There was a difference in the boners?  Oh my God.  I doubt.  His flew back like a trebuchet when she flipped it down.  And Larry's just kind of fucking laid there. 
[02:30:00]  She could fucking...  Larry's like a slinky.  She'd just wrap it in her fingers like brass knuckles.  Fuck it.  His awful cock.  She would put a splint on it just to...  Yeah.  Just to have sex.  His cock smells like just old man crotch, like tinkle.  Oh.  So this guy was on Entertainment Tonight.  He has no problem with it.  He's basically saying, look, man, I fucked Larry's wife.  And, you know...  Wow.  And I need to tell the world.  Now, here's a situation where it's the other way around than we've been used to lately with Tiger Woods and Jesse James and Sandra Bullock, that situation. 
[02:30:30]  Here's a guy now that is fucking a celebrity's wife.  And he's the one coming out and ratting and saying, yeah, I did this and giving the gory details and shit like that.  So, you know, we were blaming these dumb, loudmouth bitches for not keeping their mouths shut.  And here you go.  Here's a guy.  So one for the ladies there.  One for the ladies.  Well, the coach...  The summertime sit bag needs something to keep you cool.  I'm just doing one for the ladies. 
[02:31:00]  Like David Lee Roth does.  That was David Lee Roth.  He did one for the ladies.  Ice cream, man.  One for the ladies.  He said one for the ladies.  Ice cream, man.  I'm your ice cream, man.  Stop it when I'm passing by.  Oh, my, my.  Whoa.  Shut up.  Yuck.  Talk your way through another tune.  Oh, wait.  Ice cream.  We get it.  Whoa.  Yeah, I get it.  Ice cream, man.  What is he really talking about?  He's got push-ups, too.  I thought he was talking about just ice cream.  He's your ice cream, man.  What does that mean?  He probably was for a bunch of lactose intolerant women.  That's exactly what she said. 
[02:31:30]  That's funny.  What?  Oh, ice cream, man.  And it starts sounding like fucking D-Boys shits.  They're all shitting into their pantyhose in the back of their tennis shorts while the  fucking balding ice cream man zips around ruining terrestrial radio.  Fucking pompous idiot.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck you.  Oh, you know what it means.  Ice cream, right?  Calm.  We get it.  Oh, Larry King.  So, the kid's baseball coach talks about the affair on Entertainment Tonight. 
[02:32:00]  Here we go.  The coach.  Right now, the interview everyone is talking about.  Oh, we've got to listen to the fucking production value of Entertainment Tonight.  Right now, everybody is like, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung, chung.  God, all right.  We're watching.  Right now, the interview everyone is talking about.  Hector Panante, the former baseball coach for Larry King's two children, on the record  about what he calls a sexual affair with Sean King.  Tonight, he tells our Samantha Harris the details he has never disclosed before. 
[02:32:30]  Did you have an affair with Larry King's wife?  Yes, I did.  Hector Panante.  Dude, this music is fucking infuriating.  Oh, it's needed, and it helps the piece.  It's just nonstop.  We want to grab your attention.  We want you to emote through music, not just through our fucking horrid interviewing techniques  and shit like that.  Let's not forget, also, they say, everyone's talking about it.  No one's talking about it yet, because this was the exclusive.  The guy hasn't talked yet. 
[02:33:00]  The statements everyone's talking about.  Everyone's talking about.  No, you're playing this for the first time.  Remember, you have an exclusive.  The interview everybody in the office has been talking about.  Fucking assholes.  Hector Panante says he first met Larry and Sean King when he works at a baseball birthday  party for their son, Cannon, at Dodger Stadium.  And I went to Larry and said, Larry, these kids are real good.  I know baseball.  I've played them my whole life.  Let me work with them.  Larry hired Hector, an aspiring actor who once hoped to join the major leagues to train 
[02:33:30]  both his young sons.  In this E.T. InTouch exclusive, Hector claims Sean began flirting less than two weeks after  he was hired.  Flirting.  Well, he's really helping his acting career.  He fucking failed at acting and professional baseball.  He wound up stealing the chick from a 76-year-old.  What a bag of shit this Hector is.  Helping it's fucking prostate cancer.  Hector.  What a fucking vulture.  He stole the girl. 
[02:34:00]  He stole the 50-year-old broad from a 76-year-old guy.  Yeah.  What a fucking flop this guy is.  It's like fucking shooting fucking fish in a barrel.  It really is.  With a bigger cock.  Did he have a girl?  I'm sure he has many.  Like he goes home and she wants to sniff his dick.  It smells like garlic.  He's got Welch's grape juice stains on his balls.  Bet you Larry had a lot of Welch's stains in the back of his undershorts.  Can we see what this fucking vulture looks like? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  I hate this guy.  Yes.  I am the Latin lover.  And I said, Larry, let me teach your kids.  Yes.  What a fucking...  Very good, yeah.  Why isn't an explorer doing that?  Why would it do that, Danny?  And it closed the browser down.  You're not browsing anymore.  That's okay.  I'm just browsing.  A browser.  Yeah, Danny, let's get back to browsing.  What happened?  All right, he'll get back to the browsing.  But Danny, stop browsing.  I hate this fucking...  I want it to be a professional baseball player.  He couldn't.  Yeah.  I want it to act. 
[02:35:00]  You know how bad his acting must be?  Wow, if you hate glowy beans, I'm fucking Larry King's wife.  If you hate him after the first track, you're really going to hate him.  I just hate him because he's a fucking...  He's one of these L.A. douchebags who fucking failed at everything.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking hate those people, man.  They fail at everything.  And they have to find something they're good at.  Apparently fucking.  Fucking.  Well, he can do it.  Old men's wives.  Larry was out of town.  And I show up at the kids' game.  And I kind of felt like I saw her reaction. 
[02:35:30]  And then she got a little flirtatious with me, like I could feel her coming on to me.  I'll never forget.  She gave me three hints that she was ready to go.  Number one was, oh, when I stayed at Hawaii, there was this beautiful, sweet, you know, beachfront  that if me and you would have been there, oh, it would have been great.  Second one was, there was like, on our way to the store, we passed by Beverly Hills.  And I guess it was a premiere.  And she's like, oh, we're going to look so good on the red carpet, walking together. 
[02:36:00]  The third one was, we passed Mr. Chow's.  And the paparazzis were there.  And she's like, oh, paparazzi, we look so good.  And we get all this attention.  And were bells just going, ding, ding, ding, this girl wants me?  All three at the same time, but I let them all pass.  And the fourth one, I'm a man.  And I felt that she had to do something.  Got her back in the car.  And we kind of locked eyes.  And then from there, let's just start kissing.  He's a handsome guy.  Deport him. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, he looks like fucking, he looks like the guy that, he looks like Paco Moreno.  Isai Morales?  Yes, Isai.  Hopefully he'll have the same fucking legal troubles.  Isai Morales.  You know the problems he has.  It's embarrassing.  Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside writes, for a woman, that's like getting banged by A-Rod instead  of Don Zimmer.  That's pretty good, man.  Yeah, this guy is much more handsome.  Yes.  But I fucking hate him.  Well, listen to this clip.  I hate his flirting.  And the fifth time, her mouth was on my penis. 
[02:37:00]  And I said, I think she likes me.  But there were the worst hints the first time we went to In-N-Out Burger.  And when I came out, she said, you have toilet paper on your shoe.  And I knew she wanted to clean my ass with her husband's tie.  Fuck this guy.  Fuck this creep.  He sucks.  Did you have sex in Larry King's house?  Yes, I did.  Did you have sex in Larry King's bed?  Yes, I did.  Did that kind of creep you out at all? 
[02:37:30]  I didn't even think about that, to be honest with you.  I never thought that that would be his bed.  I never found that awkward because I felt like that was my house.  In some weird way, I was there so much.  Jesus.  What a dick.  When you're fucking spitting gray pubes out, didn't you realize you were in his bed?  Exactly.  She's fucking, you're banging some 50-year-old lady.  Yeah.  Creepy Little League coach.  You didn't smell old man breath on the pillow.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking Larry's drool. 
[02:38:00]  You stare over, you got a big rod, and you look over and lose it because there's dentures  and fucking a glass on the side of the table.  He's asking if that's cum stains, and she's like, no, it's just Larry's drool.  Oh, it drools a lot.  Larry has eye pus come out when he sleeps.  That's right.  Eye pus in preparation age.  Everything's just leaking out of Larry's body.  She's blowing the guy, and she's fucking his ass with an Emmy.  Because her fucking old fingers are too frail to reach his fucking, his young fucking Latin  prostate.  She has to shove an Emmy into his rear. 
[02:38:30]  Straps on a dildo with Larry's suspenders.  He just does him in the ass.  I did not even know.  I hate everyone in this story.  Yes.  Yes.  Everyone deserves what they get.  It never crossed your mind that this was a bed that he was going to be sleeping in maybe  that same night?  No.  It never crossed my mind.  Sometimes, to be honest, he was on TV.  His show was on while this was happening, and I never crossed my mind.  Wait.  Wait.  Larry King's show was on the TV screen while you were in bed with his wife? 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  In his bed?  Yes.  That's just weird.  He makes her watch the show, so that way he can review.  Like, he can check up on her, make sure she saw the show, and say, hey, how did I do?  According to Hector, there were some close calls while he was in Larry's bed.  Sometimes, because the boys would sleepwalk, they'd come in the room.  While you were in bed with her?  Well, I was in bed, so I would kind of dive off, and not let them see me or anything like 
[02:39:30]  those poor kids, and then she'd come, walk them back to bed, and then they'd come back  in bed.  Do you think that the kids knew about your relationship with their mother?  Unfortunately, they did.  She let them know.  What the fuck is going on?  That is just a twisted situation.  That's true.  Oh, Larry is just emasculated.  Not that he was so masculine.  She's sexy, man.  Holy shit, I'd fuck her.  She wants a fucking Hispanic dick in her.  Then again, if Larry was fucking her sister, that's also embarrassing. 
[02:40:00]  Who knows if that's true?  I don't know.  I hope so.  I have those allegations until somebody comes out, and look at him.  He's pointing to her like, look at what I get to fuck.  Look at what the Little League coach is fucking.  Yeah.  Those giant teeth of hers.  What big chopper she has.  Goddamn.  He slid into that bed on his cum stains.  On the fucking Little League coach's cum stains.  Larry gets into bed.  Well, good night, honey.  What the hell is this?  She'd have the fucking Michelle Pfeiffer and Scarface eye things on, all well fucked. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, her pussy was fucked.  Her pussy had a fucking police tape across it.  What were you eating in here?  I feel crumbs in the bed.  Oh, jeez.  Potato flakes.  Perfect, perfect.  Why is there tortilla chips on the nightstand?  And a fucking Enrique Inglés' CD.  Let's say hi to Larry King and find out.  Larry!  Larry's on the phone.  Good morning, boy. 
[02:41:00]  Good morning, Larry.  Question.  Yes?  Didn't you notice the dentures on side of the bed?  You know, it's very rare the first call is that horrible.  Yeah.  One more clip.  By the way, she should be watching his show.  It's like, you got $144 million.  Just watch the old bag for an hour.  Watch the poor old sot look like a douche.  Yeah, exactly.  Watch him ask the wrong questions to the wrong people.  Dummy.  No wonder.  He was probably so distracted.  So distracted. 
[02:41:30]  He was probably so fucking distracted doing those interviews.  What am I talking about?  I have no clue.  My wife's fucking the Little League coach.  And I have a date with her sister.  How important is the parachute?  It's not, Larry.  I'm a fireman.  Oh.  Stop fucking!  Just right into the camera.  I love the image of Larry just staring at the camera.  Stop fucking my wife!  Just checking.  Continue.  How great is that?  Oh, this is good.  A young Ricardo Montalblan has really given his wife a fucking... 
[02:42:00]  Montalblan again!  Really given his fucking wife's pussy a savage beating.  Oh, just pounding it.  Uh, Jimmy, this one's for you.  Eric in Jersey, because you know a little bit about cuckolding.  Eric, go ahead.  Good morning, John.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm wondering if the young Latin gentleman was the bull and Larry was the cuckold who had  to prepare him.  No, I bet you that Larry would fucking clean her pussy when he came home.  He'd probably use his mouth to...  Oh, God.  He'd probably clean the crime scene with his mouth. 
[02:42:30]  Larry was a virtual cuckold, though, if he was on the TV as they're fucking.  He didn't even know, but he's, like, just sitting there virtually watching them fuck  and being the cuckold.  This guy's a fucking fucking asshole.  One more clip from this.  Yeah.  Hector says he not only fell in love with Sean, he wanted to marry her.  Did Sean ever talk to you about divorcing Larry?  All the time.  She'd tell me, Hector, don't worry, he's gonna die soon.  So, just stick around, things like that, which, to me, nobody wants to hear that. 
[02:43:00]  The affair came to an end, he says, after he told Sean's mother about it.  He claims Sean has not spoken to him since then.  You know, I never asked for any of this to happen.  You understand?  And I wish none of this, I wish we'd be talking about something different.  You know, but now that this came out, I have to say my side of the story, because if  not, if I don't speak for myself, who is?  Would you take a lie detector test to prove that you had an affair?  Oh, 100%.  I'll tell you who won't be speaking for you, your fucking acting agent, or a Major League 
[02:43:30]  Baseball coach.  Fucking shithead.  Loser.  Why would he tell her mother?  I know.  Brag to your friends.  He's probably trying to fuck her, too.  Exactly.  She's fucking younger than Larry.  I'm fucking your daughter, why don't you fuck me, too?  What?  You're angry?  Larry.  Poor fucking guy.  He's just too old to put up with this shit.  He really is.  You reach a point where at Larry King's age, you're just, eh, come on.  He must be a shit heap, though.  If he's went through, like, eight wives already, he's gotta be an awful husband. 
[02:44:00]  You know he is.  Eight wives?  Can't all be their fault.  Exactly.  Just all singing his dumb songs around the house.  Well, let's ask Larry some questions.  Larry King, everyone.  Spreading the news.  The softball coach is beating my wife's pussy with his big cock.  This is the fuck I'm saying.  Larry.  I'm singing Larry songs.  I know.  Larry King.  Go ahead. 
[02:44:30]  Question.  When you're done fucking my wife, what did you do with the groceries?  The grocery.  Let's go to Larry King on line five.  Larry.  How important is the grand slam?  I want to hear more of that song.  I suck.  Start spreading the news.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  What was that from?  Oh, that was Larry trying to get fucking Snoop Dogg to sing with him. 
[02:45:00]  Remember that?  Okay.  I forget.  Start spreading the news.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm leaving today.  Come on.  Come on, idiot.  Snoop wasn't going to be involved.  Fuck my wife.  I want to be a...  Come on.  Start spreading her legs.  Can we get that?  We got to play that now.  Yeah, we played it recently.  Maybe you wanted to hear that.  Fuck her with a little league back.  Hector.  Fucking Hector. 
[02:45:30]  How awful is that?  Oh, poor Larry.  Larry was wondering what happened to her vagina.  Why it used to feel kind of snug.  And now it's just...  He was losing fucking jewelry and fucking...  As he pushes that marshmallow accordion in there.  Trying to fucking...  Trying to get it in.  Yeah.  He just opened it and just drop it in.  We got it?  All right.  Play it, Butcher.  Let's do it.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  All right.  Now, that's not rap.  But you can make it. 
[02:46:00]  Neither is this.  Start spreading the news.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  I'm leaving today.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  New York.  New York.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on.  I'm waiting on you.  I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  It's the Larry Green show.  You're hanging me out the drive.  Give it to the Jew every time. 
[02:46:30]  How humiliating.  Wow.  Is that bad?  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  To him, that was rapping.  Believe me.  He wanted to say, sing, you black bastard.  I want to.  Come on, boy.  I want to be a part of it, boy.  You know he's just...  Come on, boy.  Come on.  I thought you shines always sang.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  I know your feet are tapping in those pimp boots.  I want to be a part of it.  Fucking A. 
[02:47:00]  What an idiot.  And thank God Snoop didn't fucking buy into that shit.  Snoop, there's no way he was...  You have to love him for just sitting there looking at this asshole.  Good for Snoop.  Let's say hi to Larry King on Line 6.  Larry.  God damn.  And is it Larry King?  Yeah.  Is it more important to fuck an old man's wife or cut the grass?  Abu.  See, when you're fucking an old man's wife, do you cut the grass before or after? 
[02:47:30]  That's how that goes.  And that's how you had it.  And then you change it when you're on the air.  Let's try one more Larry King, Anthony.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  Question.  Yes.  Should a pussy taste like pine tar?  Go.  Pine tar.  Let's say hi to Larry on Line 7 here.  Larry.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hey, Larry.  How important is the backdoor slider?  Backdoor slider. 
[02:48:00]  A little pitching reference.  The backdoor slider.  We got it.  Got it.  I'm leaving today.  Come on.  Come on.  That's humiliating.  For everyone.  That was humiliating.  You think that helps Snoop's street cred?  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, yeah.  He almost had to shoot Larry.  Yeah.  He should have busted a cap in the yo.  Snoop was just, he didn't know what to do. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on and what, Larry?  He wasn't going to rap with Larry.  I wasn't going to jump into that mess.  I'm leaving today.  Oh, that was so terrible.  His wife's hope he's leaving today.  She could fuck the fucking Little League coach.  I'm leaving today.  What time, Larry?  Exactly.  You need a ride to the airport?  Fucking Hector will drive you in his fucking, his Corolla with fucking, with gold rims in  his name written on the back. 
[02:49:00]  Fucking three foot spoiler on the trunk lid.  Exactly.  Jesus Christ stencils on his headlights.  Exactly.  Religious statues all over the place.  And a giant uncut cock in his lap.  Yeah.  And two big fuzzy dice, which could be balls.  Nobody knows.  His fucking fur dashboard.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got to beat Talek.  Yes.  Play some shit for us.  Nice.  Studio set up.  It's very crowded in here. 
[02:49:30]  You bring one.  Start spreading the news.  Come on.  To the beat Talek and stuff.  Yes.  They put one soundboard in here and then we're fucking crowded.  Jesus.  I know.  Thanks for the space, Sirius XM.  We really appreciate it.  Like the old base.  We'll get him in here now.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like through,  you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi.  Whatever.  Here's the thing. 
[02:50:00]  But I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need like an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right there.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into? 
[02:50:30]  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet kit?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Firewire?  Firewire.  Dude, do you need like a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just, let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless. 
[02:51:00]  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that it?  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no! 
[02:51:30]  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine!  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000.  I'm not helping you with this.  I think somebody sent us a fan page.  I'm hanging out!  How do I get people to go there instead of sending me friend requests?  So, you're starting a family, and you've got a million questions.  As any new parent would.  Thanks to the Nicey Nice Network, you'll get the answers you need.  All right, let's not play the modern-day father, okay?  Andrew Dice Clay will set you straight on how to allocate all of those pesky parenting responsibilities. 
[02:52:00]  You stay right there.  When the kid is born, let her do, meaning your wife, what she's supposed to do.  You know what I mean?  You can stand there and watch and applaud and go, you're doing a very good job.  They do the diapering.  They're, like, numb to that shit.  Occasionally, there will be those pesky late-night inconveniences.  A mother knows how to shut them up.  A father does not.  But that's not your problem.  When the baby cries in the middle of the night, I make it simple.  You turn on the side, two feet against her. 
[02:52:30]  You start edging her towards the bed.  She'll know it's not the edge anymore when she goes over.  And she gets up, and she'll go, what the fuck?  And you say one word.  Don't make it a conversation.  Diaper.  And that's it.  Eventually, your partner will need a break.  But be sure to keep her on a short leash.  Babies could sense when the father is watching them.  Because if you don't, well, just listen to Dice.  Because when she goes, I just want to go to the gym and work out.  And then you'll get the call.  You know what?  I ran into Sarah.  She wants to get a little lunch. 
[02:53:00]  Is that a...  And what are you going to do?  You go, all right, honey.  Go ahead.  Next thing you know, Sarah wants to have dinner with her.  We're having a glass of wine at some fucking shit bar.  Next thing you know, it's one in the morning.  You're ripping the hair out of your fucking head.  Here comes this fucking sloppy, drunk fucking animal.  And she's going, what's the matter?  I take care of the baby every day.  You can't watch the baby for a few hours.  And you said, you said you're going to the fucking gym.  That's what you fucking told me.  You understand that?  And you leave me here. 
[02:53:30]  You know I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Baby's crying since you walked out of the fucking door.  Next thing you know, you're paying a half for what you got.  If prenup or not, they get fucking paid the minute babies start flying out of there.  Parenting tips with Andrew Dice Clay.  I know what I'm good at.  I know what I'm not good at.  Now available from the Nicey Nice Network.  Your job is to go, and you leave.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show on the Virus Sirius XM. 
[02:54:00]  Hey, we got Vitalika in the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  What's up, guys?  How you doing, man?  How's it?  How you doing?  How's it going?  Good morning.  It seems to work.  Damn.  I'm amazed things work.  So fun.  I love it when a plan comes together.  Nah, yeah, right?  It's rare.  Sound guy going crazy over there.  So where the hell are you guys from?  Unfortunately, Milwaukee. 
[02:54:30]  Milwaukee.  Yeah, we apologize for that.  That's all right.  Someone's got to be from there, I guess.  Who came up with the idea?  Happy Accident.  Happy Accident.  Everything is good with a Happy Accident, you know?  It was an April Fool's sort of spoof hoax type of thing we did at a party.  Handed out some MP3s, got onto the internet, and the rest is history, you know?  Damn.  Just from fucking around a little bit.  Basically.  Yeah.  Drinking some beers.  Yeah.  Nah, that ain't bad. 
[02:55:00]  That's a weed idea, not a beer idea.  So it was kind of like almost a parody you were doing, and...  Well, it is a beer idea, because we're Sergeant Hetfield's Motor Breath Pub Band.  So of course it's a beer idea.  We're from Milwaukee, man.  It's got to be a beer idea, you know?  Of course it is.  I mean, as far as...  There's a little bit of weed involved.  Yeah, as far as, like, parody or satire or whatever, that's a whole hairy legal issue  I can't even get into in, like, three minutes, man.  I bet.  I bet. 
[02:55:30]  Jesus.  That's good.  It's nice to see, like, guys making music and getting careers out of it.  Do you guys actually...  That's what I did.  Yeah, you actually have...  You draw an audience when you do gigs.  Like, people know who you are?  Like, you actually have a fan base?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, we've...  This is the second full-length...  Masterful Mystery Tour is the second full-length.  We've done, like, 10-Euro tours.  Wow.  You know, a bunch of times on US and everything like that, so I'm sure.  What's it, like, a hybrid of Metallica and the Beatles?  I mean, obviously, but are you actually being true to either one of them or both of them  or just kind of mixing it in your own, like, making up lyrics or how are you working on it? 
[02:56:00]  All of that.  Okay.  All of that.  I mean, we add our own stuff.  You know, we mess with it, bastardize it as much as we can, you know, but there's always  going to be that influence, man, because, you know, you want to appeal to that audience,  that listener and everything.  I got to say, you sound just like Hetfield, too, man.  Do I talk like Hetfield, like my voice?  No.  Well, we played some of your stuff during the breaks and stuff, you know, just to familiarize  ourselves.  And your fucking vocal, you sound just like James Hetfield.  Every now and then, I can just kind of change it up and just talk like Laws whenever I want 
[02:56:30]  to.  It just kind of depends what project we're doing.  Not so much.  That was...  What the hell was that?  Well, you want them to play or what?  Of course.  That's what they're here for, yeah.  What do you got for us?  All right, Cliff, introduce this one.  I'll count it off.  This one's known as the Masterful Mystery Tour.  One, two, three, four.  We'll be right back. 
[02:57:00]  Read all your best construction.  The master for mystery tour blinds you and you can't see a thing. 
[02:57:30]  Call my name and I hear you scream.  Master.  Master.  You know I.  You know I'm for mystery tour.  You know I.  You know I'm for mystery tour.  You know I need.  You know I'm for mystery tour.  Just a taste of me and you will say. 
[02:58:00]  You know I'm for mystery tour.  The master for mystery tour blinds you and you can't see a thing.  Call my name and I hear you scream.  Master.  Master.  Master.  Master.  Master.  Master.  Master. 
[02:58:30]  Master.  We'll be right back. 
[02:59:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:59:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:00:00]  We're ready to transform the songs.  It's pretty easy.  It depends on how much we've had to drink.  Yeah.  I can pass things by a lot better if I crack open some beers for these guys and say, yeah,  taste this. 
[03:00:30]  Flip actually is an excellent home brewer.  He really, really is.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You make your own beer?  Yeah, Utility Sync IPA.  IPA.  It's available in stores.  Yeah.  It's a lot cheaper in your basement, man.  Save some money.  Like a dollar a pint.  Oh, by the way, I got to say that.  Keith, need a new Bud Light keg stat.  There.  We ran out last night.  Yes.  We're celebrating our new purchases.  That's good.  I thought that's where to celebrate a new gun purchase.  Run out of alcohol.  I thought the drinking during the week was weighed out. 
[03:01:00]  Three glasses of beer.  That's it?  That was it?  Yes.  In one night?  That was good.  Yes.  It's one of those glasses that's fucking in the Pocono Hotels that he uses as a tub.  He's an alcoholic.  I like how you have to say that.  What would you guys say is the biggest song you have or the biggest, the most popular one?  Actually, the next one that we could do is one of the old MP3s that we had, and it's 
[03:01:30]  on this masterful Mystery Tour CD that we have out, a tune called I Want to Choke Your  Band.  Oh, okay.  I see where you're going with this.  I see where this one came from.  I can figure it out.  You do sound like Hetfield, too, very much.  Right on.  That's the idea.  It better to sound like Hetfield than to sound like, you know, if I was trying to set up  for the show.  You know, it'd be the Beatles.  Have you gotten any feedback from either representatives?  I mean, obviously not the Beatles, but have you gotten any from either of the bands? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Metallica's 100% behind us.  Oh, they like it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we hung out with those guys.  It was great.  Oh, that's cool.  That's pretty cool.  How about...  Do you have to pay him?  No.  Not at all.  Whatever we want to use from then.  Lars likes his cut, you know.  Lars enjoys his cut.  But Lars doesn't know.  They kind of kept him out of the loop.  And nothing from the Beatles' side?  No.  Not personally.  Okay.  Too many lines.  Just some suits.  Yeah.  A couple of C&Ds.  And knock it off.  We have our people talk to their people who talk to their people. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Like you said earlier, the rules of parody can keep lawyers chatting for a while.  I'm just a guitar player and a singer in a band, dude.  That's it.  That's my job.  Leave the legality.  The people with absolutely no talent whatsoever.  That's what I say.  Well, why don't we play another one then here?  All right.  So, uh, choke.  All right.  Okay.  One, two, three. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah, I tell you something I think you'll understand  When I say that something I want to choke your brain  I want to choke your brain I want to choke your brain  You'll say, please, don't tread on me  No, well, I'm a pissed off man  But see, see, don't I say  Cause he's in a hairband 
[03:03:30]  Oh, let me choke your brain  I want to choke your brain  When I punch you, I feel happy  Inside, you know  It's just a feeling that the light  Turn it right  Turn it right  Turn it right  Turn it right  Yeah, you  Here's your brain  I'm gonna take your brain  Now I'm warranted  Take my morning  I want to choke that brain

That would suck if they really came down on you guys.  We actually keep in touch with them on a regular basis.  Maybe they're waiting for you to make some cash so they can take it away.  We're waiting for them to make some cash so they can invite us on tour.  I don't think they have anything to worry about. 
[03:12:00]  That's our goal.  I don't have anything to worry about.  That would be a kind of cool opening band to have, right?  Metallica.  Yeah, they would be great if they opened up for us, man.  It'd be awesome.  Oh, damn.  Now you're reaching a little.  You guys do anything with I Am The Walrus?  You haven't been able to figure that one out yet?  Well, the thing is, we always have a list of tunes that we're going to be working on.  Yeah.  And they have to get submitted for clearance.  And we just submitted a whole other big list.  Who has to clear them?  Licensors of Beatles catalog.  Oh, my gosh.  The Metallica side is cool. 
[03:12:30]  We can choose whatever we want.  But there's so many hands in the pie when it comes to the Beatles.  It's like we submit titles.  We give them semi-works in progress.  And then they get decided upon.  We have tunes that we actually finished for the Masterfold Mystery Tour CD.  Like four of them.  They weren't allowed on the CD.  They said no.  Oh, really?  But some they're saying yes to.  Yes.  That doesn't make sense.  Different licensors.  Yeah, it's different people.  It all depends on who owns what's in the world.  Oh, my God.  That sounds exhausting.  What a morass.  A quagmire. 
[03:13:00]  That's why we don't deal with it, man.  We have other people.  He's trying to play some fun music and everything.  What a surprise.  Lawyers get involved again.  Of course.  Do I have to get involved with everything?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, another little kid outside the studio, Uncle Paul.  Oh, hi.  Uncle Paul, you know who that is?  Hello.  Who is that, Uncle Paul?  That's Barry.  You like Barry?  I do.  Uncle Paul does this on the street all the time.  He's a fast runner.  When we're walking to the parking garage, Uncle Paul will just be like, hi, Tiffany. 
[03:13:30]  Hello, TJ.  Just any little kid that passes by, hi, Daphne.  Well, Vitalica, you can see him.  Tonight you guys are playing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, tonight, Vibe Lounge, Long Island, Rockville Center.  Yeah.  Saturday, the Delancey.  That's Saturday, the 24th of the Delancey.  Hey, man, we're on in Philly, too.  I see a Philly thing.  Yeah, we're doing North Star.  That's right.  North Star in Philly on Friday.  Tomorrow night.  That's tomorrow.  Okay.  So then Saturday, the Delancey. 
[03:14:00]  Sunday, we're getting back out to Harrisburg.  And then Monday, we come back to Long Island for the Looney Tunes in-store.  It's like a special in-store appearance, Q&A, meet and greet.  We've been to Looney Tunes before the fire, and now we're going back.  So that'll be pretty cool.  There was a fire?  What happened?  It burned out.  It burned out.  It burned out of all the way.  It burned out.  Oh, wow.  Of course.  Good question, Jim.  It's usually what happens when there's a fire.  Well, I think we should wrap this up with Anto and his Hetfield.  You do a good Hetfield. 
[03:14:30]  I don't know why you're not doing it tonight.  Don't try to fucking make me look silly because I don't do one.  I'll do Lars.  You do James.  Why don't you do one?  I'll do one after you.  No, you do one first.  But it's got to be real.  All right.  You got to get up there and fucking sing it.  I can't get up there.  Yeah.  There we go.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hey.  Awesome.  Come on.  That was good.  You can do better than that, man.  Come on.  I can't. 
[03:15:00]  I got a bad throat.  Oh, my God.  That was like the most pathetic James impersonation I've ever heard in my entire life, man.  I think you need to kind of step it up a few games.  That's fucking good.  It sounds just like Kirk.  Sounds just like Kirk Hammond, right?  All right.  Well, tonight.  Oh, yeah.  They got their...  Metallica.  Metallica.org.  Metallica.org, right.  Yeah.  And get onto Facebook.  Become a fan.  Sure.  We'll tweet you. 
[03:15:30]  You guys still live?  You still live in fucking...  Milwaukee?  Milwaukee.  Or you relocate?  Yeah.  Still home base.  Still home base.  Still home base, huh?  You know Miller Beer?  I'm six blocks from it.  Oh, man.  That's a...  Well, I'm a bud guy, but, you know, that's good.  Oh, really?  You've had it with Miller Beer, right?  Yeah.  Miller Coors.  They're a conglomeration now.  Where do you get your hops?  Where do you get your hops?  I grow them, as a matter of fact.  No, you don't grow hops.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right?  Sure.  They grow up a pole, like, you know, 15 feet in the air.  They look kind of like buds, right? 
[03:16:00]  A little bit, yeah.  Like weed, a little bit.  A little bit.  You grow your own hops.  Sure.  Wow, this guy is really a beer maker.  What's the name of your beer?  Mick Bertney's Brew.  Why the name?  I mean, there's different brands.  Why the...  There's the Utility Sink IPA, the Grandpa Lenfield Irish Stout.  You know, and many more.  Where'd you come up with the name?  Clock?  What's that?  Mick Bertney's Brew?  That's my name.  Oh, it is?  Oh, you're Irish?  Cliff McBertney.  Actually, I hail from Orkney.  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  Hi.  I know.  Wow.  Land of 100,000 welcomes is what I hear Ireland is.  You ever been back there?  No, Orkney's in Scotland, as a matter of fact.  Oh, well, fuck me running.  No idea.  I try to get to Isla in Scotland all the time.  That's where all the good scotch comes from.  Boy, you like your drinking.  Yeah, well, you know.  I like this guy.  I hear you do, too.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I do tip a few.  Right on.  Cheers.  Hey, doesn't Iraq do a great James Hetfield?  He does, but he won't do it.  Can we get Iraq to do his Hetfield for the guys? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, Iraq really does a good one.  I've heard him.  Huge fucking Metallica fan.  Probably the biggest Metallica fan.  Is he wearing a Metallica shirt today, too?  I decided on Green Day, which is weird.  What the hell is that?  That's not.  Look at him attempting to run.  Oh, my God.  You see?  Seismographs are going crazy all over the globe.  Right.  Iraq, I was just bragging to these guys how great your James Hetfield is.  Come on, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Bust it out, dude.  Yeah, bust it out for the boys, all right?  Yeah.  Can you play a little something in the background just to get him in the mood? 
[03:17:30]  Okay.  Here's Iraq and his James Hetfield.  Here we go.  All right.  Yeah!  What are you, fucking wrestling?  It's all the same.  Oh, yeah.  What were you doing?  Snap into a Slim Jim.  Hulk field.  Yeah, what he's doing?  That stunk.  Yeah, try the James Hetfield.  There was too much Hulk Hogan in there. 
[03:18:00]  That sounded more like Hetfield.  Wait, you do one, and then he does one.  You know what I mean?  I hurt my throat.  I blew my throat out.  Good.  Do like the beginning of Ender Sandman, because he knows that one.  Come on.  Go ahead.  Now come right into it.  Don't have to wait for the intro as long.  Come on.  Right.  Ready.  Ready.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Right.  All right.  Come on.  Go!  Say the plan! 
[03:18:30]  Don't forget my son to include everyone.  Yeah.  I don't remember the rest.  Come on.  I can't see you people.  Come on.  See you.  Till the sandman becomes.  Come on.  Sleep with one eye open.  Reaping your pillow tight.  Come on.  Come on.  Enter night.  Exit light.  Or the other way around.  All right.  All right. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's off to never, never land.  Yeah.  All he's doing is tank canker us singing Metallica.  Wow.  You like that?  He's good, right?  People are saying this is unforgivinable.  Wow.  Said, but boo.  Zero of the day.  It's off to garlic, garlic butter land.  Wow.  Shit breath. 
[03:19:30]  Master of nothing.  People are asking if that's off the Blech album.  Garlic breath.  Go back and eat my hero of the day.  Holy shit.  The virus finally had a joke.  There we go.  There we go.  And he's out.  He's pulling a Costanza.  The four horses' asses.  Oh, shit.  Could you guys play just a solid Metallica song as we go to break? 
[03:20:00]  Because that kind of sounded cool, too.  Or you don't do that.  That's like.  We don't know any full Metallica songs.  Actually.  Give me a little something as we go to break.  Metallica, everyone.  It's all happened. 
[03:20:30]  We are lashing out action.  Returning to reaction in France.  Get back on post of a day.  Battery here to stay.  We're raising hell and not that a man's war.  You know it ain't easy.  Never any part to say.  The way shit is going.  Can't kill the battery. 
[03:21:00]  Battery.  Back to rain.  Back to rain.  In Paris we took over the hilltop.  Ripped and tore away at the weak.  The newspaper said.  The blood's running red.  We're only trying to get us a piece.  Oh, you know it ain't easy.  Never any part to say.  The way shit is going.  Can't kill the battery.  Oh, that's hooray.  Oh, that's hooray. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Damn.  Right on.  Right on.  By the way, they're still making E-rock jokes.  One.  Dot, dot, dot.  Piece of crap.  I have a whole list I came up with during that song.  Oh, okay.  Eat and destroy.  Eat and destroy.  Ride the frosting.  I got fattery and mustard for all, bread and butter fan, creeping breath, and enter bland  man.  Enter bland man. 
[03:22:00]  Tank Rizzo, for whom the fat rolls.  Nothing else matters but the buffet.  Nick and Virginia.  Poor bastard.  James Cloverfield.  Did we do Master of Muffin?  Master of Muffin, Brian and Quincy.  Oh, right on.  Guys, this was a lot of fun.  Cool.  Thanks for having me.  Thank you, man.  Absolutely.  It's Vitalica.org.  Vitalica.org.  All right.  That's where you'll get all the dates and everything else that has to do with the band. 
[03:22:30]  Right on.  We're going to take it.  Hey, this is Victoria Gotti.  Hey, this is Don Cade.  Because I talk to guys that found the black boxes, and yet our government says they weren't  discovered.  Why?  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku, and you're listening to Oppie and Anthony.  Oppie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to Oppie and Anthony. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah!  Mike Smith in Putnam.  Yeah!  For whom the Taco Bell tolls.  Yeah, for whom the Taco Bell tolls was great, and Enter Sandwich.  Enter Sandwich came out during the break.  Fucking hysterical.  Enter Sandwich.  Goddamn.  James Cloverfield was pretty fucking solid, too.  Poor Iraq caught a little bit of a beating.  A little bit of a beating.  Yikes. 
[03:23:30]  Wow.  Master of Crumpets.  Does that work?  Well, a crumpet.  Sean from Brooklyn.  Master of Crumpets.  It's funny, crumpet is a funny word  Welcome home with cafeteria in parentheses  That's pretty good if you know what's happening  That's pretty good, man  Who is that?  Jeff B. Austin, Texas  Give yourself a fucking smiley face today, motherfucker 
[03:24:00]  Good one, very fucking good one  Seek a dessert, that kind of works  Chester's liver  Seek a dessert  Hi, Jimmy  Hi, Jimmy had a wee-wee  Yes, I did  Hi, who's this?  Oh, it's a purchase, I didn't forget  Oh, yesterday, what a day we had  We teased that about two hours ago  Yeah, at the beginning  We were busy, we had a lot to talk about  As you know, Danny, our own Danny Ross 
[03:24:30]  Is now a resident  Of Nassau County  He's no longer city folk  He lives out in the country  Take that, Queens, New York  Exactly  You just cut down your taxes, right?  I don't know yet  Yes, you did  Next year  You did  City taxes  Absolutely  You don't do city taxes anymore  Oh, yeah, I guess so  You don't do city taxes  You don't own a house  You just gave yourself a raise  No more city tax  Yep  No more city tax  Wait, no, but his  You get city tax for just working in the city, right?  Nope  You gotta reside  I don't pay city tax 
[03:25:00]  So if you rent in the city, you don't get city taxes?  No, no, if you live there, you do  So live, you don't have to own for the city to take a little piece, right?  Yes, yes  As long as your address is in the city  So Danny, you just gave yourself a raise  Yeah  Cool, man  First more in a while  Isn't that good?  No shit  Yeah, right?  No shit  No shit  Fucking stingy bastards  So, you know, the priorities have to be straight  Because in any of the five boroughs of New York City  You are not allowed to buy a gun  Unless you have some type of license, permit, paper, even a rifle 
[03:25:30]  You can't just go into a gun store and buy a rifle  You need to tell the city that you want to purchase a rifle  And all that happy horse shit  And get a permit for said rifle  Pistol's another story  It takes a long time, permit and everything  But we were just talking about rifle  So he's in Nassau County  And how long have you been in Nassau County, Danny?  Just about three weeks  And it was time to get Danny a rifle  Oh my god, is that easy? 
[03:26:00]  I need a shooting buddy  Besides Keith  Keith's hours are kind of weird sometimes  But isn't he allowed to shoot anyway?  Who?  Wasn't he allowed to go down the range and  Yeah, but you have to have your own gun, dude  It's like fucking, you know  Holy mother of god  Look at this busty fucking woman  By the way  Look at the tits on her  Yeah, this is  Talk about guns  This is a huge story today  There's a Lane Bryant ad  And this woman has like solid  Yes  Solid D's  There's a slight chunk to her 
[03:26:30]  But in a sexy way, right?  Not in a Kirstie Alley way  Right  And who chose not to show that?  I think ABC or something said  She's too busty to have on TV in a bra  But it's okay if a girl is flat chested  And doesn't have as much cleavage  You could show that  Yeah  I think that's the story  We'll get back to your gun  Oh yeah, yeah  You know what the fucked up thing about that is?  Let me add something about that  The Lane Bryant and all that fucking fat bitch stores  They hate the regular 
[03:27:00]  And the girls that shop there, by the way  At Lane Bryant  They hate the regular stores and regular models  Because they're glamorous  And they offer up this image that isn't a real woman  You know how they're always bitching about that?  Skinny waif models that are walking around  Now, they've gotten to the point where they're showing fucking like  Slightly fat chicks that are hot as fuck  And you would nail  Oh yeah  On their commercials  Oh yeah  Which is not an accurate representation of their clientele  Of who shops at Lane Bryant  They're fat slobs  Not this big-titted monster 
[03:27:30]  Look  She's a tit monster  She's fucking  You just want to put your wee-wee there  It says  Narrow-minded ABC nixes book some babe undie label  This full-figure beauty appearing in a Lane Bryant lingerie ad  Caused fits for ABC  Which reportedly wouldn't run the spot because of too much cleavage  That is a lot of fucking cleavage there  And while Fox runs ads featuring stick-thin Victoria's Secret models like Miranda Kerr  They balked before agreeing to run the commercial 
[03:28:00]  So she had too much tit meat  Scrump-diddly-icious  Too delicious for TV  But she's hot  Yeah, she really is hot  She's not like a Lane Bryant  Put it this way  Steve Carr shopped at Lane Bryant for Pendulum  Remember?  No, I don't  Yes, apparently  A while ago  Yeah, it was a long time ago  But that's the caliber of woman  That's Sean's Lane Bryant 
[03:28:30]  Right, exactly  Steven Carr  So they're just showing like  Hot, curvy women  And not the messes that shop there  Which defeats the whole purpose of them and their ads  Guys, the paper's being funny  You ready for this?  Oh, come on  Jimmy, you ready for this funny?  Bring it  ABC is issuing a fatwa  Oh, a fatwa  A fatwa  Instead of fatwa  They're gonna cut her tits  Against full-figured models  Plus-size label 
[03:29:00]  Lane Bryant says  Oh, Lane Bryant's getting a lot of fucking promotion out of this  Would you blast that?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  There's no doubt  That model that they nixed  They have a picture of her laying down on a fucking couch  That's the same one  That's the same one as this  While I was fucking her  I'd say  Yeah, that looks like her  Time to make cum, piggy  Time to make cum, piggy  You think she'd get off?  You said that?  No, she'd probably push me  She'd push me up 
[03:29:30]  Like to make me stop  Right, right  But I would just go  Time to make cum, piggy  They were supposed to run the ad during Dancing with the Stars  But it was too much cleavage  And, of course, Lane Bryant is calling the executives  A bunch of prejudiced boobs  Oh, now there's  Ah, boobs  I get it  Right  Yep  I get it  Boob  Meaning stupid or tits  Yeah, that's great  That is a nice set, though 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that curvaceous fatty  All right, Anne  So back to the gun thing  Sorry  So after three weeks being able to get one  We finally decided it was time  To go down to our pals there at Coliseum Gun Traders  In Uniondale  And pick up a firearm for Danny  Pick up a firearm  It was about time  It was about time  Because, you know, I don't even have my bedroom set put together  Jesus  And I have cardboard boxes all over my place  But you know what? 
[03:30:30]  We have to go to the range  I don't even have drawers in my  In my  In my  I don't even know what you call that  In my dressers  Or a bureau  No, they're just on the floor  Yeah  Just all strewn about  But now you could fucking look at your cool gun  But now I'll blast the shit out of somebody  Right  Just try coming in  Don't come in  Don't try to come in and take my drawers  Because now I'll shoot you  Don't tread on me  That's right  And, you know, when you go to the range  Yeah, you could borrow other people's rifles and shit 
[03:31:00]  But when it's your own  You're setting it up  You set up the sights the way you like them and everything  And it's just so much better that way  So we went down there  And talk about the kid in the candy store  Oh my god  Looking at different types of weaponry  And rifles  And Danny trying to decide which one to get  You know, it is pretty difficult  Trying to pick out your very first firearm  Your very first rifle  It's a big step  What to do  What to do  Yeah, he went with a Rock River Arms  Yeah, like your basic AR style 
[03:31:30]  Is that a good choice for a first gun?  Yes, Rock River Arms  They run you a little more than like a Bushmaster would  But they're built like brick shithouses  If you shake the thing around  You won't hear one little rattle  They're very solid  When they fire  They got some weight to them  So when you fire it  It doesn't have as much recoil  It's more accurate  Because of the weight  It's a great rifle  It's wonderful  And Danny picked up that 
[03:32:00]  And then I, of course, cannot walk in the store  Without adding another to my collection  So I had to pick up another pistol  What'd you get?  I got a Wilson Combat  Sentinel  .45 caliber  Pistol  It is  The shit  That's it right there  Pop that fucking picture up  Are you running out of room?  That's the one I just bought  Are you running out of room in your gun closet? 
[03:32:30]  That is  No  I have so much room  In my gun closet  So much  I got it for a little  I can think of 30 people  I would like to put that  Whose temple I would like to put that against  I really can  Alright  Including this room  How many less would that make?  Let's see  One, two, three, four  Holy shit  Uh, yeah  I can't call the show  I can't call the show  Because Jim's debating style yells  So I'll write it  Fuck you  You fucking 
[03:33:00]  You fucking  Basement pussy message board faggot  Fuck you  I'm confused  Call the  One guy  Call the show  Cunt  What happened?  Just one  I just  There's  Fucking  Babies  I listen to every  Fucking dissent  I'm sorry man  I listen to every  Dissenting opinion  To tell me that I don't let  Callers  Fuck you  You fucking 
[03:33:30]  Coward  You wanted to sit home and write  In your fucking basement  You didn't want to call the show  You're free to call the show  And defend your point  Fuck you  Your guy did  What you accused Jay of doing  And you don't like it  So fuck you  Jimmy  Fuck you Chris  He can't call  Because you're debating style  You just yell  That's what  Yeah I've listened to  Every fucking point  Someone has made  I've listened to  No you don't  What's this about Jimmy?  I'm not going to mention where  It doesn't matter  The guy knows who he is  You're a fucking twat  Call the show 
[03:34:00]  Twat  Call the show  You want to make a point  Don't sit home and try to  Spell check  Call up  Spell check  Fucking faggot  Call up  We got open lines right now  So call  Thank you  I feel much better  We got open lines  Call right now  Wow  I fucking  And I'm completely off the subject  Again  The mentally ill  I've been ranting about them  Should just be put down  They don't fucking stop  Is this the same thing?  Same fucking thing  No I mean the same thing  As the Chris thing  Or is this  Totally different  No no totally different 
[03:34:30]  People are going to go  Alright so you're ranting  About two different things  At the same time  That has nothing to do with Chris  Is there a me me me thing happening?  Yeah of course  Chris has nothing to do with that  I'm just  I'm mildly irritated with Chris  Something else actually  Spawned that  The fuck  People  What are we waiting for Kenny?  Let's move on this  God  Oh wow  Fucking shit  What's going on?  There's all kinds of shenanigans  Going on here  Still there's a me me thing happening? 
[03:35:00]  Yes  Fucking non-stop  I don't give a fuck  About your problems  I don't fucking care  Nobody does  I gotta agree with you  Holy shit  Wow  Somebody's just me meing  Dead the fucking worst  Yeah  And you even try to talk to him about it  And if you can't get through that thick skull  By the way this has nothing to do with 
[03:35:30]  The other thing  No with Chris  No  That was just an irritated moment  Yes of course  This is completely separate  Let me make sure that that's  So it's like I'm snapping on some fucking fan  Who disagreed with me  So  Sorry about that  I apologize  I sit on it sometimes  And there's other times  Where I just want to go  I don't even want to be specific  It's like  What are we not fucking moving on this for?  I 
[03:36:00]  I love Jimmy's responsibility  Because this discussion  Or little you know  Outburst I guess  That Jimmy just had  Was based on a picture of a gun  On a screen  And him going  I would love to have that  And put it to some people's temples  There's a reason I don't own it  That's why I'm saying  I know why you are not a gun owner  And I mean that  Never allow me to have one  And I'm saying this publicly  Never allow me to have one  You will use it 
[03:36:30]  Dude  I'll spend the rest of my life  In prison  For one moment  I'm not responsible enough  I'm with Jimmy  But it would  Oh my god  I'm with Jimmy  I can't have a gun either  Because I'm clumsy  I would  It would just  Oh you would just drop it  Or like lose it  Where did I leave my gun?  It's funny you should say that  Because today alone  I left my house keys at home  And my wallet in Kenny's car  I mean  Yeah  You can't just leave your gun  And go like 
[03:37:00]  I think I left it in the bathroom  And I thought I left my wallet at Starbucks  So do you really think I would be a responsible gun owner too?  Yeah that might be a little bit of a problem  For different reasons obviously  Jimmy would absolutely use it  And mine would just go off and fucking hit a mate or something  It is a great responsibility to have  Yes it is  I guess you have to be the  You know  Certain tempered guy  Or you know  Whatever  There's going to be something going on  I would have it in my waistband  I really would  You'd be one of the guys that just stick it in your waistband  I'm plexigal bearish in a second  I'm sticking your waistband  Jimmy I got some advice for you 
[03:37:30]  Oh my god  Just tell this person to stop  It could just be a bunch of people  Oh my god  They don't listen  Just tell them to stop  It works  Any people who could just be so self-centered  They don't listen  Because they're so wrapped up in their own fucking dog shit life  Yeah  Nothing they say resonates with me  Nothing  It doesn't register  It doesn't  You're not going to say the magic thing  That's going to make me focus on you 
[03:38:00]  I don't give a fuck  The magic thing  You're not going to have  Believe me  You're never going to find the words  Oh my god  That move me  No  Never  You want this person to keep trying though?  Whoever these people are can keep trying  Yeah  Yeah  I'm not saying who they are  Of course  Alright we're just trying to get more info  Yeah  A few people  Yeah  Wow  And again totally disconnect  Well I'll tell you one thing  Listen to this  Brandy in Augusta, Georgia  Brandy  Yes 
[03:38:30]  Turn down your radio  You're on the air with us  Oh hello  Hello  Hi  Talk to Jimmy  And tell him what you  Jimmy  What's going on  Yes Brandy  I don't know what's going on  But I love it  Just keep doing it  Thank you  Well why don't you  Tell him  The first  Screaming  Yeah tell him about your sloppy pussy  It's wet  Dripping  I like to hear that  She's got a sloppy pussy  Because you're yelling and screaming  She doesn't even know what you're screaming about  But it just made her sloppy
