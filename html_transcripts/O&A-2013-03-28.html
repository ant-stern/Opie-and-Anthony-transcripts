<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter, quickly transitioning to Opie's impending trip to Boston for Jim Norton's comedy special.  They discuss their contrasting packing styles, Opie's last-minute panic versus others' preparedness. The conversation then pivots to a school district banning dodgeball, sparking a debate on perceived oversensitivity and the proliferation of "bullying" claims.  The hosts share crude anecdotes about their childhood games, including those with now-offensive names.  This segues into a discussion of the Miami Dolphins logo change, speculated to be due to political correctness concerns, leading to a lengthy, often offensive, debate on Native American imagery in sports, referencing the Washington Redskins and a caller's story about his hometown team's former name, "Pekin Chinks."  The segment ends with continued discussion of these topics.

The show then features Eddie Trunk (previously a guest) as a point of reference in a discussion of Iron Maiden's "Run to the Hills,"  the song subsequently being played, its lyrics about Native American conquest highlighting the earlier discussion. This is followed by explicit advertisements: a Jim Norton phone sex hotline and a preview for "Unmatchables," a dating show starring Jim Jefferies and Justine Jolie, both filled with sexually explicit jokes.  Lady Gaga's birthday is briefly mentioned, transitioning into a debate about the Defense of Marriage Act and the Supreme Court's decision on gay marriage, including commentary on justices and perceived hypocrisy. This leads to a discussion about changing school mascots, specifically the renaming of "Orientals" and "pipe cleaners" (changed to "Kamele" sticks).  A detailed and graphic discussion of a pornographic video featuring Bianca Stone follows, focusing on pubic hair and aesthetic preferences.  This transitions into anecdotes about the hosts' personal experiences with women and body hair. The segment continues with a discussion of a quadriplegic man stranded on Disneyland's "It's a Small World" ride and the ensuing lawsuit.  Finally, an interview with Dave Marciano from "Wicked Tuna" occurs, prompted by a listener's fishing trip request complicated by a boat sinking.  They discuss tuna fishing, the industry's realities, and the difficulties of the business, ending with a discussion of the poorly-received TV show, "Joe Forrester," interspersed with various advertisements.

The next segment begins by criticizing a black NAACP leader for perceived victim-blaming comments, transitioning to a discussion on the intersection of gay rights and civil rights, contrasting the perspectives of black leaders opposing same-sex marriage with the hosts' views.  The nature versus nurture debate regarding sexual orientation is explored, drawing comparisons to racial identity emulation.  Kevin Pollack calls in, singing a repetitive song ("Tequila and Donut") and discussing his role in *Casino*.  The broadcast then announces Boston Mayor Menino's retirement, featuring a comedic audio montage of his speeches, followed by discussion of former Governor McGreevey's coming-out and current life.  Speculation on the possibility of a gay president ensues, revisiting James Buchanan and including listener calls and discussion of Lincoln's sexuality, fueled by a listener's claim of History Channel programming supporting this theory, leading to a tangent about the History Channel's programming. This moves to jokes about sharing beds with friends, fueled by anecdotes from Jim Jefferies' experiences, which further transitions to candlepin bowling and a discussion of Jefferies' show *Legit*, ending with listener calls and Jefferies promoting his show;  throughout, offensive language and sexually explicit humor are prevalent.

The final segment features a guest appearance by Jim Jefferies, with a discussion heavily focused on sex, strippers, and differing perspectives on acceptable sexual behavior. Jefferies recounts a story about visiting a Playboy Playmate's house and encountering her roommates, leading to a humorous misunderstanding about an "eight ball" (a pinball term). The conversation moves to a comparison of men's and women's reactions to sexual acts and lap dances, including descriptions of explicit acts performed by strippers and the story of a comedian's glasses being used as a sex toy.  The discussion expands to bachelor/bachelorette parties, fisting, and varied reactions to it.  The topic shifts to cars, specifically key fobs and push-button ignition systems, with Jefferies sharing anecdotes about his past job selling car stereos and mobile phones, including comical mishaps involving a van and an airbag.  This leads to a discussion about the evolution of mobile phones and a story about a failed flirtation attempt.  The segment concludes with plugs for Jefferies' upcoming shows and a second season of *Legit*, a discussion of his past employment, and descriptions of his poor work ethic before becoming a comedian, including sleeping and farting at work, ending with a commercial for Judd Apatow's "This is 40."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m. and this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to talk.  Like rotten egg from sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day, every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking circus?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Piety, people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gone, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yep.  Oh, there it is.  Good morning.  Oh, hi, everyone.  Hi.  Oh.  Don't you panic you're gonna forget something?  What happened?  You don't pack early. 
[00:02:00]  I would panic if I was gonna forget something.  I was telling Anthony, it drives everyone around me nuts.  I'm going to Boston because I'm supporting Jim Norton and his special that he's taping  up there.  I'm going on my own dime just like I told everybody I would.  Yes.  I don't need to wait around for these people.  Oh, please.  We kind of wanted to bring the show up to Boston.  We thought it was a no-brainer, but they said, well, if we're doing the bus trip, you know,  we can't do both, really.  So let's put all our efforts toward the bus trip.  And then the bus trip was canceled or postponed.  They're saying a postponement until late September or something. 
[00:02:30]  But at this point, we don't believe it whatsoever.  So don't get excited about that.  No.  But I can't pack the night before, ever, ever, ever, ever.  No?  So I think the train leaves an hour after the show is over.  I will leave.  Yeah.  Not early.  I will run home.  I will run around my apartment like a complete lunatic.  I will pack.  And I will step on that train right around what time is it, like 12 or something. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And I will be there.  Doesn't that make you crazy?  It would make me crazy.  I can't do it the other way.  I can't do it.  I panic.  I have to be packed the night before, have all my computers in my bag laid out.  Oh, wow.  I got to make sure and then have 95% of it done because I always forget something.  See, I'm a mixture between you two.  See, I kind of pack some stuff and then the last minute I'll throw in toiletries.  As long as I got my phone, my charger, and maybe, I don't even go with a laptop a lot of times. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, okay.  I've got a couple videos I want to edit on the train, so I might bring the laptop.  Not that anyone cares.  Uh, no, I'll run around like a lunatic.  Wow.  I can't do that, man.  I just, I can't sleep knowing, like, I like to have everything folded and ready to go.  And it's not like an OCD thing.  Like, I just want to make sure I'm prepared to leave with a fucking plane or whatever.  Nothing wrong with that, Jim.  Nothing wrong with that.  And I can't just pick a few pieces of clothing.  What happens?  Do you think, like, I don't need everything?  I have to, I look at every shirt, I pile them up on the bed, and then the OCD takes over, 
[00:04:00]  because now I'm like, I like these seven shirts, but you're only going for a day today.  Wow.  So then I have to narrow it down.  And then your shoes.  Do you just look at all your shoes and go, which one should I take?  My shoes, I got a pair of sneakers and a pair of fucking, it's winter, boots type shit.  Yeah.  Did you ever say to yourself, I'm going to put three shirts?  Because three shirts is fine.  You don't know.  Yeah, but then I see that fourth shirt.  I'm like, man, but I like that fourth shirt, too.  But then you got to say, fuck it.  No, I know.  In the end, I do. 
[00:04:30]  It's all about socks and underwear.  Yeah, but I think if I go, if I do it last minute, then a lot of that shit, I don't have  time to fucking let seep into my brain, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, it drives everyone nuts.  And now that I've got a family, you know, you can't do it that way.  No, no.  You got to go.  Kenny has pulled up.  Like, Kenny has dropped me off at the airport a lot of times for vacations.  And he'll call and go, I'm downstairs.  Excuse me.  I go, well, I've just started packing.  He goes, we're leaving in 10 minutes.  And it's a trip for a week.  Oh, man. 
[00:05:00]  And I'm like, I'll be there.  Yeah, yeah.  And I've never not been there.  But I run around like a fucking lunatic.  Are you packed, GH?  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Oh, it's such stress, dude.  I can't do that.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just doesn't work the other way for me.  I don't know.  I can't lay my shit out the night before.  I lay a couple things.  It would be nice to be here with a bag packed for Boston.  It would be great.  I pack a little earlier if I'm going on a plane for some reason.  Yeah.  If it's a car trip or something, then you're just like, man. 
[00:05:30]  Well, a car trip's great because then, you know, last minute I just start throwing stuff  in the back.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  You just, as you're walking out the door, you're like, oh, that.  It's not going to hurt to throw a couple more shirts in the back.  You and those shirts.  Whatever.  I know.  I have a few with me, though.  Dude, not just to wear for this show, but I mean, it's like regular shirts.  I'm wearing this.  I probably have three other ones.  I like that Andrew Dice Clay shirt.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Yeah, I love this Dice shirt.  That is sweet.  But I always bring a couple extra ones.  I overpack a little bit.  Do you understand, like, the train is, what, 10, 12 blocks from here, and I have to go 
[00:06:00]  home to get back to this point?  Yeah, yeah.  All within maybe a little over an hour?  Oh, man.  But I'm completely fine with that.  Completely.  Yeah.  The Acela?  Are you taking the Acela?  Yeah, we're doing the choo-choo this time around.  Did you do first class?  Fuck yeah.  I love how first class on the Acela is like any other seat, except they give you, like,  some fucking shitty thing to eat.  Yeah, and a tray, and would you like some rotted shrimp? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, sure.  It's delicious.  The Acela shrimp is like the bottom of the shrimp totem pole.  It's terrible.  Shrimps with cancer.  I like the quiet car.  Do you like the quiet car?  Yeah, because you know you're going to get a few Z's in.  But the problem with the quiet car, they still have the announcements every fucking stop.  It should be like this, hi, everyone.  We'll be stopping in.  You can't have a quiet car if every five minutes, next stop, Trenton, Trenton, next stop, Trenton, 
[00:07:00]  blah, blah, blah.  There's got to be a better way to do that.  Because you're the problem in the quiet car.  You know, when someone looks at you and goes, shh.  Yeah.  That's not as bad as the announcement that happens every stop and wakes you up anyway.  How about an app where it just comes up on your phone and goes like, bing.  How about someone that just whispers?  Yeah.  You want them to come by, excuse me, not even a, just Trenton.  Willoughby.  This stops Willoughby.  Willoughby. 
[00:07:30]  Willoughby.  I think I'll get off.  So, I'm excited.  I haven't been to Boston in a while.  It'll be good to see Jim Norton.  And big news in Boston.  Mayor Menino's stepping down.  Oh, I am.  It's a massive rumor that is completely out of control, so it's got to be true now.  Well, in a few days, I'm sure he'll, I think he talks today.  He might have perished in a car accident in a few days.  Oops.  Oh.  Oh, no, he didn't.  You know, we started doing radio together in 94. 
[00:08:00]  He started as the mayor of Boston in 93.  93.  He did 20 years up there.  He was brandy new mayor when we got up there, huh?  Yes.  Wow.  20 fucking years.  Holy shit.  That is unbelievable.  I think that's, what, five terms?  Yeah.  So, he's going to announce, I think, today that he will not seek a sixth term.  I will not seek, nor will I accept your nomination for mayor of a sixth term. 
[00:08:30]  Next, Jim.  Jim of Bofferson.  Of Bofferson, mayor.  Oh.  I'm going to have some chowder now.  Whoa.  Well, there goes that bit.  God.  There goes that bit.  Oh.  It's just horrible.  Obviously, I'm already on a train.  Oh, Jim.  That train derailed. 
[00:09:00]  It really did.  Let me go find my luggage.  Yes.  Find a bus.  Yikes.  Why are you stepping down?  You think it's health?  I bet.  Oh, they're saying, like, ongoing health issues, I guess.  It's just time.  I mean, he's an old guy at this point.  No one really.  How old is he?  70.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  I thought he was older than that.  He's only 70.  That's pretty young these days.  Is he a good mayor, though?  They love him up there.  Like, as much as he's annoying to listen to?  I have no idea.  I mean, we can't get past the speech thing.  I have no idea if he's a good mayor. 
[00:09:30]  I guess people would say he is.  Can't get past the fucking him throwing us out of fucking Boston.  He's loved by the people around him.  Beloved.  The beloved mayor.  Beloved, right.  I'm sure they'll do all kinds of fucking stories about his tenure.  Yeah, when he was in the hospital recently, like, that just kind of went away.  No one really said what it was or anything.  I bet it's some kind of health issues.  A little of everything, probably.  I'm looking to live out the rest of my life out of the public sector. 
[00:10:00]  Sector.  Mayor mommy and all.  We could stay in New England, because there's a school in New Hampshire.  We love looking at these schools.  New hamster.  Got another school banning another thing that we all grew up with.  Oh.  Every single one of us grew up with this.  Oof.  Anal warts.  Anal warts.  Oh, no.  What?  And you got a school district banning this activity. 
[00:10:30]  Who wants to guess?  If you know.  Q-tickling.  Every single one of us played this.  Yeah, yeah.  And I would guarantee that overwhelmingly, most people loved doing this activity.  Can I yes?  And now it's being banned.  Yes.  Hot foot the retarded boy.  Giving him a hot foot to the retarded boy.  Did anyone ever really give someone a hot foot?  Certainly did to the retarded boy.  Yes, the retarded boy.  We told him we were sending him to the moon.  He'd be clapping. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know how I feel about any of this stuff.  I think this is ridiculous.  It's one of those things in school.  It was very exciting when you found out you were playing this in gym class.  It's a gym activity.  A gym activity?  You mean J-I-M?  Wait.  Gym activity.  I think I know.  They're banning it.  Yeah, yeah.  What is it?  Fucking when you come in with trench coats and fake guns and go, ya-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.  Holy shit.  Rat-tat-tat-tat. 
[00:11:30]  Rat-tat-tat-tat.  But then it was fake.  Of course.  No, that's not banned.  You could still do that.  Um, well, we could just play the story.  Yeah, let's hear it.  It's been a rite of passage for students for years.  Playing dodgeball.  The classic at gym class.  There's the answer.  Dodgeball.  There's the answer.  Very thrilling.  Very exciting.  They are.  Dangerous.  The element of danger.  Danger.  Oh, it was scary.  The ball would just bounce off your stupid noggin.  Yeah.  You used to make that sound effect. 
[00:12:00]  Bing.  Yeah, it's hard to do on these processed mics.  It had that ringing sound.  Can't do it anymore.  It didn't really cause any injuries.  When you got hit in the side of the face, though, it would leave that big red fucking welt.  You know a little sting here and there?  They don't even use those balls anymore.  Those big red ones?  No.  They use, like, small nerf balls.  Ah, fuck it.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  What are we doing?  Soft balls.  Those red ones.  Soft balls.  Fucking baseball.  Marbles.  Baseball.  Hard marbles as opposed to soft ones. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know when it started because they were still using the red balls, like, 15 years ago.  What was wrong?  So they banned the red balls how many years ago?  What?  Last 10 years, I guess?  Yeah, wow.  What is wrong with us?  You know what's exciting was?  Those red balls don't start, Jimmy.  No, I'm only saying.  Those red balls were never a problem, right?  I loved dodgeballs, but it really is, like, it's great if you're a jock, but if you're  a dork or a fat kid or, like, the fucking, the mispian, you're fucking, your head.  You needed a target.  Your head was basically, your head was a deer. 
[00:13:00]  That deer with his head exploding.  You were trying to knock people's glasses off.  Yeah, he's a dummy with glasses.  I was little for my age, most of my schooling, and, you know, I didn't give a fuck.  I got my ass handed to me in dodgeball.  It was fun, though.  You get those fucking guys that were able to palm the ball and do that fucking highlight  throw.  Like, their arm was a highlight fucking, and, like, wham, fucking wail at you. 
[00:13:30]  I fucking love dodgeball.  It was fun, yeah.  Believe me, I got nailed plenty of times playing dodgeball.  When you knew you were playing dodgeball in the gym, that was a good fucking hour.  It's like, oh, well.  That was a good day, actually.  We were going to go outside and do a little track and field, but, of course, the weather  is not conducive to us going outside.  Toes on the line.  We're going to be playing dodgeball today.  I love dodgeball and floor hockey. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, that was fun.  My school was big.  Washington Drive School was really into floor hockey.  How much fun was it checking someone into that big accordion wall?  Oh, I got you.  Oh, yeah.  And it just fucking oscillates back and forth like a wave.  Wow.  It wasn't cool for my brother, Brett, the owner of F.H.  Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village.  He snapped his fucking arm.  Did he?  On one of those accordion doors. 
[00:14:30]  It might have been floor hockey, too.  I got to ask him.  Oh, he got a good snap.  They also banned the variation of dodgeball called Prison Ball.  What's Prison Ball?  Prison Ball, well, the way that we play.  The loser gets fucked in the ass.  It's also called Booyah.  So you stand there with your asshole open and try to throw a dodgeball into it and catch  it like the reverse of a waffle.  Picture an ice cream falling out of a waffle cone if you reverse the camera angle and it  went back onto it. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Prison Ball.  Prison Ball.  The way we played was just like dodgeball.  But we also had basketballs.  And anyone that would get eliminated would go into prison.  And you could shoot into the hoop.  And if you got the ball in, all of your people got out of prison.  Oh.  You know what?  And would your mommy come back?  No, she wouldn't.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, no.  Just thinking it might have been.  You know what?  I can shoot as many baskets as I want.  She's never coming back.  It's not going to happen.  We had a variation of that.  I don't remember how you got the guys out of prison, though. 
[00:15:30]  I don't remember shooting a hoop or something.  That's what we did.  I forgot what it was, though.  Damn.  Did you kick anyone in the balls?  No, I would just throw the balls at them.  Oh, oh, oh.  This is before I learned I could just do that.  Oh, see, I thought.  Let's get the dodgeball story out of the way.  This is another ridiculous thing schools are doing.  It's bullying, I think.  Is that what they're going to say?  Probably.  It's been a rite of pep, but we're from the future.  Wow.  I love knowing we're from the future. 
[00:16:00]  Well, future boy.  But they think it's bullying and this and that.  I'm here in the future saying that I also played dodgeball.  I was a little fucker through school, so I wasn't the best at dodgeball.  I got my ass handed to me, and people around me got their ass handed to me.  I've talked to all my fellow students from back then, because they're also in the future.  No one was affected by this.  No one was bothered by this.  You know what?  It's not bullying.  No one's scarred by this.  Not by dodgeball.  No way.  Because when you played dodgeball, you wanted to get the most athletic and big kid out first, 
[00:16:30]  because then the team would be weaker.  You would team up on the biggest kid.  You're not trying to get the little scrawny kid out that can't throw the ball.  No.  You kick his ass later.  I think I was one of the last guys remaining all the time, because I wasn't a threat at  first when the game started.  No worse than that big jock, though, when you fucking wail the ball at him as hard as you  can, and he just goes, thunk, and catches it.  Right.  You're out, fucker.  And then he just wails one of your friend's heads right off with a fucking ball.  You just...  But by point, were you scarred for life from that? 
[00:17:00]  No.  Did you have any injuries that were long-lasting?  Not a tad.  Maybe there's a spin in this story.  Maybe there's a reason why they're fucking banning this.  No, no spin.  Jesus.  God, we're raising a whole generation of wimps.  Pussies.  It's been a rite of passage for students for years, playing dodgeball, the classic gym class  game even popularized in its own movie.  But dodgeball may have met its match in the form of the Wyndham School Board, which at this 
[00:17:30]  recent meeting voted 4-1 to end dodgeball and other so-called human target activities.  Games with names like bombardment and slaughter.  It's almost turning it into a nanny state.  The one board member who voted against banning the games says the move is way over the top.  What happens when they replace that game with something different that another group doesn't  want to play?  Do we eliminate that group of games?  The school district says a handful of parents had complained about bullying. 
[00:18:00]  A handful.  That their kids were targeted during dodgeball.  Oh, God.  Oh, come on.  My son has been targeted.  Oh, God.  Why did we invent that word bullying?  Bully.  We absolutely did not have that word in school.  You know what?  We did have the word, but it was like...  Do you remember?  It was like fucking...  What's his name from the Little Rascals?  Butch.  Right.  Butch from the Little Rascals was a bully.  He'd go around and punch people and threaten people. 
[00:18:30]  That's a bully.  Fucking playing dodgeball or telling a joke in school.  That's not bullying.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Oh, Christ.  So a couple parents.  Once again, the minority gets something done.  Yeah.  Why is it always the minority?  Why can't the rest of the parents go, well, tough shit.  We don't see anything wrong with dodgeball.  Yeah.  Why is it the minority that gets the big voice?  It's apathy.  People never...  Right.  People never say what they like. 
[00:19:00]  They only say what they're more vulnerable than what they don't like.  Yeah.  So it's like with this EMT guy, Timothy Doulas.  Yeah.  If everyone who didn't want him fired and said, look, this guy kind of saves lives, he just  wanted to tell some dirty jokes, called up, outraged that they might fire this guy.  Phones would never stop.  They wouldn't fire him.  Yeah.  People who say you care about this guy, call up and defend him.  But they're not going to do that because people are busy working and, you know, dealing  with their wives and their kids.  I'm very busy today. 
[00:19:30]  But only people who are angry are driven to act.  It just seems very logical to ignore the minority in these situations.  Like, you know, we got in the most trouble in radio because of the minority.  Yeah.  Those special interest groups.  Believe me.  I don't like the minority.  And most of the special interest groups don't even listen to the show to begin with.  Yeah.  So you're not even hearing the voice of the people that actually listen to the show.  Yeah.  That's fucking ridiculous.  A committee. 
[00:20:00]  I think they're really fun because, like, they're just soft balls.  Yeah.  Soft balls across your nose.  The new policy goes into effect immediately, and the school district is still researching  alternative activities that still use the same sort of physical exercise.  Ah, come on.  God, yuck.  Yuck.  What kind of competitive game?  Anything that's competitive can be called bullying by these people. 
[00:20:30]  Any competitive activity is bullying because there's going to be people that are better  than other people at it.  Right.  So the people that aren't as good are going to say, like, oh, fuck, I suck at this.  They cry to their parents, and then the parents say, bitch, that it's bullying.  My son was it too many times in 10.  Yes.  He doesn't like being it.  Well, I mean, you know, Ann makes a good point.  There always has been bullying, but we didn't throw that word around like they do now in  schools, and now the definition of the word bully and bullying has expanded to a point 
[00:21:00]  that it's ridiculous.  There are people that just try to think up what is bullying.  Well, dodgeball officially is bullying in that school district.  But then you've got to wonder, like, how much this is the kid or the parent, because  I can just see, you know, a kid saying, oh, yeah, I got knocked out a couple times in  dodgeball, and then the parent's saying, oh, you got eliminated more than once?  Oh, that's bullying.  You were bullied.  So wouldn't, well, they don't think logically in schools these days, but wouldn't you go 
[00:21:30]  to these parents and go, well, if you don't want your kid participating in dodgeball,  that's totally fine with you guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Exactly.  And you'd have a couple kids, those weird kids, that had to walk out of the room during  the Pledge of Allegiance.  Those weirdos.  My parents don't agree with this.  So, yeah.  You just set up your kid for a lot of abuse when that kid had to raise his hand.  Oh, that's right.  Okay, well, you can remove yourself. 
[00:22:00]  I'm a Jehovah's Witness.  We don't believe in that.  My parents are Jehovah's Witnesses, which pretty much makes me a Jehovah's Witness.  I don't know.  I have a dodgeball story where it made me a better man.  You want to go there?  A better man.  Well, you know what it was?  I know the story.  He knocked the kid out of a wheelchair, and he felt confident to do anything at that  point.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Tennessee.  Andrew.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Andrew?  Uh, before, uh, ah, never mind. 
[00:22:30]  Uh, I used to be probably about 50 pounds back in elementary school.  I used to get picked on a lot.  I used to get targeted all the time or bullied.  Uh, I ended up, started lifting weights and, uh, started picking on those kids that picked  on me whenever I got big.  That's good.  You fucking get bigger, and then you, uh, bully, uh, the, uh, smaller kids.  You know, shit rolls downhill.  You gotta fuck with them back, right?  Well, that's right.  What?  It's terrible. 
[00:23:00]  All right, that's an amazing story.  Thanks.  It's just a whirlwind story of tragedy to triumph.  And triumph, yes.  That's amazing.  Right there.  We just heard it firsthand.  First time.  I'm gonna remember where I was when...  Right.  First time I've heard that.  Yeah.  So when I got bullied, then, you know, gets big.  All of a sudden, he read the ad in the back of the fucking comic book.  Yeah.  He was Mac.  He wanted to...  He was being bullied on the beach.  Was it Mac?  Mac was the guy who kicked sand in his face.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In front of his chick.  Yeah, he's laying there with his girl. 
[00:23:30]  Mac comes over and just kicks sand in his face and gets it all over his pineapple.  Now it is.  You don't hit the gym.  You pull out your fucking gun.  You shoot him in the head.  Glock, glock, bitch.  Right.  You can't exclude someone or else that's bullying.  So remember when I said if you don't want your kid doing the dodgeball?  Oh, exclusion.  So now that's a form of bullying as well, I guess.  Right.  What a nightmare.  What a nightmare.  Because I know there's teachers out there we hear from all the time.  They don't want to deal with this crap.  No.  They know it's nonsense and bullshit. 
[00:24:00]  But the other parents have to get involved.  Yeah.  Parents in that district should say, all right, what the fuck are we doing?  Really?  We're banning dodgeball now?  And what do they replace it with?  And Travis said the balls, they already, you know, went, you know, they don't use the big red balls anymore.  No, no.  Little soft nerfs.  That's fucked.  So stupid.  I used to.  I have fond memories of the old dodgeball.  You know what?  I have memories, too, because this guy's saying they used to play bombardment with basketballs. 
[00:24:30]  We used to play with any fucking ball we could find.  Oh, shit.  Especially when the gym teacher didn't give a fuck.  Fucking.  Because he's a failed athlete.  He would go into his office in the middle of a dodgeball game and we would pick up whatever the fuck we could find.  A fucking globe from fucking history class.  Right.  I love a globe at someone's head.  He would peek out every once in a while with his coffee.  Yeah, make sure.  And you know there was something in that coffee because he was miserable.  There was a, I guess a.  A dodgeball? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, man.  That's nothing.  What is this from?  It's from the news story.  That's not a dodgeball.  Oh, my God.  It's like a big orange.  Yeah, my kid plays with that.  That's how safe it is.  He's not even three.  There was a game called Animal Ball.  It's like a large orange.  We played Animal Ball and it was dodgeball, but it was in the, it was like everyone went down into the basement where the steam pipes were for the school and shit.  And it was this room that I guess it was used for wrestling and there was mats on the floor and the walls.  So it was like this weird version of dodgeball where, I don't know, you had like a corner. 
[00:25:30]  It was like catty corner fucking.  So someone could be next to you and hit you in the side of the head.  Sounds like a teacher was covering up with something.  Yeah, something.  That room used to be used for something else.  Yeah.  Someone found out and he goes, no, no, actually we come down here and play dodgeball.  When you had a run, like they put the dodgeball in the middle and blow the whistle and you'd have to run to get it.  Right.  And if you were the guy that got close but didn't get the ball, you got fucked. 
[00:26:00]  Because that means you're right there for the guy that got the ball to just fucking nail you at point blank.  Yeah.  Dodgeball was fun.  Come on.  Fucking pussies.  Yeah, but the kids that might not be good at dodgeball, maybe they're the, you know, the math kids.  Maybe you could be a mathlete.  But then is that bad?  A mathlete.  But if you're a mathlete.  Yeah.  But that means other kids aren't good at math.  Is that going to be a problem next?  I'm at the science club.  Is that bullying because you're better at math than someone else? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  You might say that's outrageous, is it?  My son is horrible at the long division.  So we don't want long division.  No more of the long division.  Long division.  That's all nonsense.  That is all nonsense.  Had it with school.  I'm not going back.  And the phones were lit, but whatever.  It's the same story.  Anybody agree with the band on the phones?  No. 
[00:27:00]  No.  That's the problem.  No.  So the teachers, the parents have to get together and go, look, what the fuck are you doing?  This is stupid.  Why do they always have Jay Moore on Imus?  They always have this clip of Jay on Imus.  He's always on Imus.  He's always on Imus.  He's either always on or they always replay him.  Because it looks the same.  He's got that beard down.  I think that's all.  He must have had an amazing appearance.  They play it all the time.  Play that Jay Moore again.  I like him.  I mean, we used to play a game called Smear the Queer. 
[00:27:30]  Well, yeah.  Smear the Queer, right?  Kill the guy with the ball?  Yeah, but that game wasn't sanctioned by the school.  No.  That was as you were waiting for the buses.  Yeah.  See, in the old days, when you were waiting for the buses, you could run willy-nilly wherever  the fuck you wanted.  Yeah.  And we would get a quick game of Smear the Queer-ins.  And we called it Smear the Queer at Washington Drive School.  Yeah.  Remember that game?  Kiss where the pee comes out.  I don't remember that one. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, you jump up and down, yell, yay!  And you kiss where the pee comes out.  The boys and girls, it's in the same area.  What do we do, Uncle Paul?  We have time, it's rainy.  Jump up and down, I'll show you, yay!  Oh, fuck.  That's where the pee comes out.  And you sing, that's where the pee comes out.  Jimmy has different memories than us.  It's very strange. 
[00:28:30]  You're a creep.  It's such a creepy thing.  We're looking back fondly, and he's got very different memories of growing up to us.  I don't like dodgeball.  No?  No, everybody throws it at you.  When you're walking home, orange crush cans.  Hey, molester.  Molester.  Hey, pitiful.  Bullying.  Yeah.  I was bullying.  That is bullying.  They should leave you alone.  The smear of the queer was great, because it was, what, a football? 
[00:29:00]  Whoever had the football, you had a fucking tackle?  Yeah.  You either were really brave and took your beating, or if you were me, when you got too close,  you fucking panicked and threw the ball in the air.  How was that?  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, that was fun.  Kill the guy with the ball was just pretty much, yeah, same thing.  It's football with the football and the tackling and stuff, but there's no rhyme or reason or score to it.  No.  You just, whoever had the ball, you would kill the guy with the ball. 
[00:29:30]  And that guy would run his ass off.  Yeah.  But you would get him eventually.  What's the, what's like the motivation to hold on to the ball at that point?  Like, there's no scoring.  Well.  It's stupid.  Chris Gates, one of the guys I grew up with, he was an animal at that.  Yeah.  Oh, he loved having the ball.  He actually walked on to the Jets and almost made the team.  Really?  Yeah.  A walk-on.  But he threw the ball at somebody's helmet and they're like, that's wrong.  Yeah, you don't do that.  He threw it at the center.  Hit him in the back.  You're out.  Chris Gates was one of our, he was like probably right up there as far as athletes go. 
[00:30:00]  And he loved having the ball.  He was your version of Boomer.  Yeah.  He didn't give a fuck that.  He got his ass handed to him in the end.  But he would throw stiff arms and everything.  Oh, really?  Oh, trying to get him down was a nightmare.  Doing that Heisman Trophy stance?  Oh, fuck yeah.  He would take guys out with him.  He didn't give a fuck.  Yeah.  He'd throw elbows, whatever it took.  Fun to watch.  I don't know why I remember that, but I certainly didn't. 
[00:30:30]  And then I remember he had a fist fight with a girl once, too.  I wonder if he remembers that in the schoolyard.  Of a fist fight with a girl.  First time I ever saw a guy duke it out with a girl.  Did he clock her in the fucking face or something?  Yeah.  Wow.  Maybe he doesn't want me singing this one.  Really?  This goes back a few years.  Yeah.  You know, we're talking Washington Drive School.  You know, you're what, 12 when you get out of there.  Yeah.  But he fucking duked it out.  I remember this bro, it was pretty big, too.  And I do remember the time.  I remember it was so wrong to see. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  But I also remember thinking, yeah, she kind of deserves it.  She deserved that shit.  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  I absolutely.  Okay.  Because it's so wrong to hit a woman.  Yeah.  Well, I did once, so I fucking clocked it with that fucking branch.  I fucking picked up a...  How old were you?  Oh, God.  36.  I think I was seven.  And this girl's name...  Seven.  Seven, you're kind of the same sex still. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  But she was older.  All right.  She had, like, tits on her.  Oh, okay.  I can't remember.  I think her name was Rosalie.  Rosalie?  Yeah.  Rosalie.  How old are you then?  You went through a time where people were called Rosalie.  Her name was Mildred.  Yeah, Rosalie.  Rosalie.  In Central Islet.  And this was, of course, some more of fine guidance from my dad.  He told me one day that if anybody fucks with you, and they're bigger than you, you'd pick 
[00:32:00]  up the biggest stick you could find and just bash them with it.  I'm like, all right, Dad, that sounds good.  And, of course, no more than 20 minutes later, I had the opportunity.  Wow.  Yeah.  Go figure.  What are the odds?  Well, Rosalie...  Rosalie?  Rosalie was the fucking apartment complex's bully.  She really was.  She would just go around and fucking push kids down and shit like that.  How old was she?  She was probably 12. 
[00:32:30]  And you were seven.  And I was seven.  Yeah.  And...  That's intimidating, though.  And she was...  Yeah.  She started having, like, tits.  It was like, uh-oh.  Well, she's a woman.  Yeah.  So, um...  She was giving me some shit.  I don't even...  She...  I don't even think she...  She touched me.  Right.  I think she just said something.  You know, hey, come here, you fucking...  So I was like, oh, so I picked up a big stick, and she had her back turned.  I hit her in the back, right between the shoulder blades, with a big stick. 
[00:33:00]  Did she leave you alone after that?  No, she's...  I remember her falling on the ground and crying.  She started crying, and I felt bad.  And then my dad smacked me for hitting a girl.  I said, but you said, you don't hit a girl!  And he did the same thing.  Yeah, and I was crying, of course.  He yelled, don't hit a girl.  Don't hit a girl!  I didn't meet a girl!  He was, like, pissed that...  Your dad confused the hell out of you.  It's like, how about some stipulations, you motherfucker?  Sure.  You can't just tell me to hit somebody with a stick, and don't put fucking... 
[00:33:30]  That's funny.  You know, it's like the monkey paw fucking wish thing.  You gotta be specific.  It's like making a deal with the devil.  That's funny.  My dad wasn't very good with the specifics.  Sure.  You know, so, um...  Yeah, he hit Rosalie in the back.  Fucking bitch.  That's really funny.  Get that Rosalie.  Well...  So, they're banning Dodgeball in New Hampshire, and it leads to our next story, which is similar.  They changed the Miami Dolphins logo.  You see that thing? 
[00:34:00]  Why do they do that?  Well, you know what?  I think you could figure...  You haven't read the story yet?  No.  Okay.  I've seen the new logo.  And you could figure it out.  I only learned about this when, you know, I walked in here and the TVs were on, and we  figured it out immediately, me and Ann.  Let me look at it.  Immediately.  Travis is over there having a good time looking at football stuff.  I know, right?  Trav?  What are you doing there?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  By the way, the Miami Heat lost, so their streak is over. 
[00:34:30]  That's it, huh?  Everybody started talking about it, and they fucking jinxed them.  As Travis finds the logo.  But, yeah, the Heat are done as far as their streak.  That's...  Whoa.  What the hell's going on there?  So...  Why are they zooming in on the old one?  It's just a gif.  Don't...  Oh, man.  Oh, I like a good gif.  I like the one that's like that, that just keeps coming at you.  Well, let me see.  Is there one of the old ones I can see?  David Hasselhoff.  Okay, yeah.  There you go.  There it is.  Figure it out, Jimmy.  Look at that. 
[00:35:00]  Well, the football helmet on the old one, they removed.  It just looks silly, by the way.  The football...  A dolphin wearing a football helmet looks silly.  It's dumb.  It doesn't have anything to do with...  Yeah, but I mean, it looks...  The dolphin looking...  But everyone in Miami, they're used to this logo.  And if you're going to change the logo, then why wouldn't you go for something drastically different?  That's why it's so easy to figure this out, because it's a very similar logo.  They made some subtle changes.  Is it because people complained about the football helmet on the dolphin? 
[00:35:30]  Like, dolphin exploitation?  I mean, I can't imagine why they would do that.  I think, yeah, you're sort of onto it.  What?  You're sort of onto it, because the old logo...  He looks mean.  You got the football helmet on the dolphin, which is basically, you know, dance for me, motherfucker.  And it looks like he's jumping through a hoop.  Yeah?  And the new logo makes the dolphin look like, hey, man, I'm just fucking in the ocean, you know?  He's launching himself.  Yeah, chilling out, jumping some waves.  And now, the thing that used to look like a hoop now is the sun. 
[00:36:00]  Or are they just saying...  Now, what...  I don't remember hearing any complaints or pressure on the dolphins.  There's never complaints.  That's the problem.  Somebody overthinking it.  Maybe they just thought they needed a new look or something.  A change.  Or maybe they thought this is awful and childish, and they want to get new marketing.  Bill Burr was great.  He said it looks like some fucking corporate logo for a corporation that wants to look like  they're environmentally friendly.  There you go.  It does.  It's like...  That's exactly what you're talking about. 
[00:36:30]  It's a little generic.  It's fucking...  It's to make more money, because now people will buy all these new logos.  Very good.  They'll make money.  You should have a new logo for every day, so people have to buy it.  Well, that's why baseball teams will wear the throwback uniforms.  It's so you buy them.  It's a marketing thing.  It just makes the money for the team.  I love that the Redskins are hanging in there.  There was a story last week.  Again, they're pressuring the hell out of them to change that logo.  And they're like, no, man, this is based on our history.  I can understand a new team or some expansion team not going with some offensive name. 
[00:37:00]  But to change names that are already out there and have been out there for years and  years, it's just silly.  It's the one politically correct thing I actually agree with.  Really?  Really?  The Indians explained themselves, and they were right.  Wow.  Redskins was a pile of dead Indian body.  Like, you can't do Chinese accents on the radio.  Imagine if you had a slaughtered Chinese or whatever.  Say they were called chinks.  Imagine calling a team the chinks.  That literally is the equivalent of that.  Redskins were fucking bodies. 
[00:37:30]  Jersey.  I want a chinks jersey.  Even though I agree with, like, hey, look, the name has been there for a long time.  But then the other answer is sometimes...  But this political correctness is getting so out of control that I think you've got to  fight at every turn because they're just continuing to push forward.  Yeah.  But that's the problem with all the bullshit victories.  Like, that's actually something that's...  When I heard them explain themselves, I told you one time it changed the way I felt about  it forever.  They weren't maniacs about it.  And they were like, how would anybody feel?  I think it's ridiculous because I honestly think it shows Indians as being in a powerful 
[00:38:00]  light.  It shows them as being very strong and conquering.  Even though, you know, they got their asses handed to them.  But it's...  You want your team to be something strong.  Call it the Bucks.  Call it the Bucks and have a black slave there who's strong.  There you go.  But they...  You know what I mean?  They wouldn't dare.  Let the Redskins do something else politically incorrect with a group that doesn't have the  lobby power the American Indians do.  Well, I mean, they all went for kind of warrior type names. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah, right.  Warriors.  See?  Yeah, Braves.  Do you feel...  Yeah, I was going to ask.  Do you feel that way about the Braves and the Indians as well?  And like Chief Nakahoma?  That's the only group that's getting cartooned.  Like that...  It's the fucking...  Right, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, I don't like it.  But what's so bad about that?  Because it's obvious nobody...  What is so bad about it?  If it wasn't, every team would be doing it if it wasn't bad.  Like, they know they cannot fuck with Jews.  They know they cannot fuck with blacks.  They know they cannot fuck with gays. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, you know, the fucking...  And show like a macho man, like the fucking stereotypical gay...  They wouldn't fucking dare.  They wouldn't fucking dare show a shirt like that.  So they're not just being brave.  The fucking Detroit sissies.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  When they were coming up with all these teams, they didn't look at gays as being strong whatsoever.  So they would have never named their team that way.  Yeah, but you know what I'm saying.  They were looking for strong names for the time.  Right.  You know, our thinking has obviously changed over the years. 
[00:39:30]  But that's why they didn't go there.  Yeah, yeah.  Fighting Irish is different.  The Irish haven't complained.  It doesn't...  Yeah, the little fucking...  The little fucking leprechaun putting his fists up.  I agree, but...  Yeah, but I think the Irish at this point are sick of everyone thinking all they do is drink and fight, though.  Maybe.  They do.  Maybe.  But that's what they do.  They haven't gotten trampled here, either.  This is the one issue I agree with.  The Irish definitely got shit on.  I mean, not the American.  The Irish had some tough times, man.  The Irish had some real hard times.  Yeah, they were treated like fucking pieces of shit when they got here. 
[00:40:00]  The Braves still do that.  I know they do.  But, yeah, so you are right in that, like, you know, we don't really seem to care what  they think.  We don't give a fuck.  We wouldn't do it to any...  If we were doing it to every group and going, you know what?  We're having a good time.  Fuck it.  The blacks get offended.  We'll deal with it.  Dahl.  These cocksucker teams do nothing but buckle to pressure and try to behave politely and  not get anybody in trouble.  But, man, this issue, this one issue, because the American Indians don't have the fucking  voice that, like, black groups do or fucking all these other groups do. 
[00:40:30]  They don't have the voice.  Look at their fucking casinos, man.  That's true.  They're making a nice living.  No, but they don't have the fucking...  They obviously don't have the voice to get this changed.  They've got their own fucking laws.  No one gives a fuck about them.  Honestly, I still think, even though it's cartoonish and everything like that, I still  think it's complimentary that sports teams would use Indians as logos and shit like that.  I really think it is.  It says we don't take you as fucking seriously.  And, again, I'm not being PC.  I don't think it says that at all.  But they feel it does. 
[00:41:00]  They think, like, picture your religion.  Like, the Braves and all that shit.  That's our religion.  Like, try that with another religion.  Do that with Muslims or fucking Catholics or fucking anybody.  They're acknowledging Wiccans now in colleges.  Like, it's the only group that gets shit on like that.  I don't know.  It just drives me crazy because people, you know, if we had balls as a country and did  it to everyone and said, yeah, we do the Jews, we do the blacks, we do everyone, I would  agree with you guys 100%.  We're just heading toward an extremely bland society. 
[00:41:30]  We're just going to have to agree that the Indians can go fuck themselves.  I don't agree.  I just feel bad for them, you know.  I really do.  Do you?  Yeah, because they were part of, like...  They should have just been smarter back then.  Yeah, really.  They kind of...  What the hell are you doing?  Yeah.  Jesus.  They believed.  They didn't make good decisions.  They really bought it hook, line, and sinker.  They really bought in.  Jeez.  Let's move a little further west.  We're coming in.  Hey.  We'll leave you alone.  Hey, I think this is a good thing for us.  Yeah, yeah.  No, we'll leave some buffalo for you.  Don't worry. 
[00:42:00]  No, that train coming through ain't going to affect your lifestyle whatsoever.  Don't worry about it.  They were too trusting.  They really were.  That's what I've learned.  Can't be that trusting.  They were very warlike with each other, too.  Yeah, of course.  Everyone thinks that the white man came in and really wiped out this peaceful...  Wiped out this peaceful India that...  Those tribes were killing the fuck out of each other.  I'm not just doing that.  That was fantastic.  Yeah.  But, you know, I just... 
[00:42:30]  Something about it bugs me because it's the only group.  Yeah.  If we want to be a ballsy country, you want to be ballsy, then do it to every group.  I just like when we push back as far as special interest groups go.  Yeah.  I love it.  Did you like F Troop?  Because it's extremely rare that someone actually stands their ground.  The Hukawi Indians?  Their history is the Redskins.  I mean, they didn't name their team after, you know, blacks or a religious group or something  like that.  The story you're talking about from last week, there's a bill in the house that would ban... 
[00:43:00]  Hello, Bill!  It would ban trademarking the term Redskins.  Yeah.  So the Redskins could still use that name, but they wouldn't have, like, the market...  So anyone could start making Redskins?  Anyone can start making Redskins.  Nah, that's bullshit.  See, that I don't agree with.  You can't bully that...  Like, you can't make them change.  But, like, they changed the name Washington Bullets because so many fucking people are  getting shot in D.C.  Right.  Right.  They shouldn't have.  But, I mean, that's...  They shouldn't have changed that either.  Where's all this bravery from other teams?  Where's all the fucking bravery?  They shouldn't have changed that either.  They were the Baltimore Bullets way back in the day, right? 
[00:43:30]  Then the Washington Bullets.  What are they now?  I forget.  Washington Wizards?  Wizards.  Because then they turn around and come up with a dumb name.  That's a grand name.  Oh, it's horrible.  And then they turn around and they make a fortune off of, you know, retro and vintage Washington  Bullets shirts.  Ah, yeah.  By the way, I've said it a few times over the last few years, my father-in-law is a huge  Dolphins fan.  He hates the new logo.  So, he's like, what the fuck?  Why would you change it after 45 years? 
[00:44:00]  Did they say why they did it?  What was their reason that the team gave?  It looks like, you know...  Probably just update.  They're making the Dolphin look cooler.  I bet it's just an update.  And that the Dolphin's not there for our amusement.  You don't put a fucking little helmet on a Dolphin and make him jump through a hoop like  you see at SeaWorld.  It's adorable.  That's kind of like a SeaWorld thing on the right.  Now it's like, look how cool the Dolphin is.  They're rebranding the team.  He's empowered.  Yeah, you empowered the Dolphin.  The Dolphin's empowered.  The old logo has been around since 95.  That's some PC shit.  No one's going to admit it, but that's some PC shit going down right there. 
[00:44:30]  I think it's dangerous, too, because he has no face guard on that helmet.  It's going to happen.  95?  You can't with that stupid bottle nose.  This logo that they changed it from has been around since 95.  Wait, what was the one before that?  That was the old one.  Go back, Travis.  Let's see what it was before that.  Apparently, the new logo uses the true aqua and orange that were part of the first 29 years.  Okay.  Wait, what was the first logo?  Let's find that first logo.  Why don't they stop changing the fucking logo?  It's just stupid. 
[00:45:00]  Damn.  Oh, that looks like a fucking...  They just made the Dolphin look...  It's like horrible clip art.  Yeah, they just had a horrible artist back then.  That's terrible.  Okay, it's pretty much the same logo.  They just made it stand out better.  That's why I never noticed the change.  Yeah, no, that's pretty much the same logo.  What's on the side of the helmet?  That?  Was that on the side of the helmet?  What's on the side of the helmet for Dolphin?  Damn.  Well, they couldn't even make that.  No, I don't mean in the logo.  I mean on the actual players.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:45:30]  It is that logo.  Yeah, it is.  So they're going to put the new logo on the side of the helmets.  Yeah.  It's making money.  How about that?  I think it's a little more than that.  They know that, you know, you change the logo, you certainly make a shitload of money,  but somebody's overthinking it in the front office.  Ow.  Somebody was bothered by the fact that, you know, dolphins are being mistreated.  They're stupid bottlenose.  And then you got a logo that kind of shows that they're being mistreated.  Grab that thing.  Ooh, Dan Marino weighs in on new logo.  Oh, does he like it? 
[00:46:00]  It would be funny if he unleashed a tirade.  You know what?  This is a cunt logo.  What did Marino say?  I don't know.  Every time I click on it, it doesn't open.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Here we go.  All right.  You got a quick quote from Marino?  What did you say, Dan?  Saw the new Dolphins logo, followed the development stage, and now it's great to see the finished product.  Oh, he's probably a company man.  Let's ask Dan what he thinks.  Hashtag 13 approved.  What?  That's his number.  Oh, okay. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, God.  He's a company man.  He is.  Of course he is.  Dan, what do you think of the new logo?  I think it's fantastic.  Hey, we got to look up the Pete.  Wait, this guy's got something.  Hold on a minute.  Matt in Illinois.  Matt.  Yeah, I'm from a city called Pekin, Illinois, and we were called the Pekin.  Yeah, what are you looking out the door?  Sorry.  Looking out the door.  Don't worry.  You missed the...  And what was the punchline there, Matt?  We were called the Pekin Chinks until the mid or late 70s, and they changed to the Dragon. 
[00:47:00]  Come on, really?  Yeah.  So, Jimmy, there were teams named after some other shit.  Yeah, then they changed.  Wait, is this true?  Yes, it is.  I believe Matt, but I just want to back it up here.  I want to see the actual logo.  Back that shit up.  That's a liar.  Fighting...  Wait.  Fighting Whites.  Boost the Chinks.  Wow, that's fucked up.  What sport was this in?  What sport?  What sport did the Chinks play?  It was just the high school team.  So everyone...  High school team were named the Chinks? 
[00:47:30]  Holy fuck.  There you go, Jimmy.  Yeah, but they changed it.  That's great to know.  But then it's the Dragons.  But we look at Chinks, right?  We hear that.  We go, how the fuck?  Listen to the disbelief on everybody.  What?  The Chinks?  Like, people can't believe they would have called a team that.  Yeah.  And the fact that the Asians get that respect...  I guess we're just used to the Indian names.  Do you know what their roller skating arena was called?  What?  No.  The Chink Rink.  The Chink Rink?  Yep.  What?  What the fuck?  Was that from Chinese people, or was that based on something else? 
[00:48:00]  Like a nickname for something else.  Was it a...  Did you have Asians in your school there, Matt?  No.  It's a pretty white town.  Yeah.  It's changed over the years.  But back then, I think there was kind of a...  People didn't want to change the name when they were trying to change it, but they eventually  did.  Yeah, because it's, you know, tradition and stuff.  My grandfather used to call Chinese food Chinks all the time.  And it wasn't being ironic or funny or anything.  It was like, yeah, let's get us some Chinks tonight.  Fran, Francis, get us some Chinks. 
[00:48:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And then we'd eat Chinks.  And as a kid, I remember saying that, too.  Like, oh, cool, we're getting Chinks.  And, you know, you get your chicken chow mein and stuff.  Grandpa, you still love saying that Chinks.  Wow.  You say a lot of other things, too.  Let me tell you.  When we went to the track, oh, boy, did he not like some of them Jockeys.  Yeah, I mean...  He called them Little Monkey all the time.  Really?  Yeah, the Jockeys.  It's like, that little fucking monkey.  Wow. 
[00:49:00]  I go, oh, man, Grandpa.  And then he'd yell at me for putting my feet up on the seat.  He would yell at you, too?  I was constantly being yelled at as a child.  Holy shit.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  White man.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Can we play it in to break?  You're right.  Run to the hill.  I don't know that song.  What?  You don't know Run to the Hills?  Oh, my God.  Beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep.  Beep, beep. 
[00:49:30]  But...  You know what?  You're in good company, because Eddie Trunk didn't like that song, either.  I didn't put it on his fucking list.  I don't think he put it on his top five.  Ha, ha, ha.  I loved that day with Jay Moore.  Oh, man.  Oh, and Eddie Trunk was here.  Oh, and Eddie Trunk was here.  He was trying to defend himself.  I was like, look, if you do the top five Iron Maiden songs, you just have to put Run to the Hills on there.  You got it.  I'm sorry.  You just have to.  You have to.  Wah, wah, wah.  You got it now?  All right.  We're going to break with this.  Oh, yeah.  And we're playing this out today. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Have fun.  Who's got the ramp for this?  You got it, Ed?  You got it?  Try it.  Try it.  No, Jimmy, you got it?  I do.  You know, this was a great song.  Why is he fading it down?  What are you doing?  God.  Oh, my God.  So we could hear you.  We heard him fine.  So we could hear him.  Is that what they do when they fucking talk up a song he rock?  You've been on radio forever.  Yeah, they have compression that drops the song.  Whoa.  You're going to lose this one.  It was so low. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Do it again.  Put it louder.  Yeah, perfect.  All right.  Here comes the song.  You know, this was written by Bruce Dickinson.  Oh.  This was after Paul Diano left.  He went to do something else.  If you remember, Murder from the Room Ward was his.  This is one about the American Indians that they sing.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  And he's very angry.  He killed our tribes. 
[00:51:00]  He took our game for his own need.  We fought him hard.  We fought him well out on the plains.  We gave him hell.  But when it came, so much for free.  Oh, will we ever be supreme?  Riding through dust clouds and violent wastes. 
[00:51:30]  Galloping hard on the plains.  Chasing the redskins back to their holes.  Fighting them at their own game.  Murder for freedom to stab in the back.  Women and children are cowards that take.  Run to the hills.  Run for your lives.  Run to the hills. 
[00:52:00]  Run for your lives.  Soldier blue in the barren wastes.  Hunting and killings again.  Raping the women and wasting a man.  The only good engines attain.  Selling the whiskey and taking their gold.  Enslaving the young and destroying the old.  Run to the hills.

I do not  I was up there for three years  I don't remember  East High School in Rochester  They were called the Orientals  The Orientals  Can you look that up?  East High School in Rochester  They used to be called the Orientals  And they changed their name  A while ago  Because, Jimmy, you were saying  You know  Why haven't they named  You know 
[01:00:00]  I'm not surprised about that  But I'm saying  Why aren't they now?  I'm kind of surprised  I'm kind of surprised  That they ever went there  I didn't know it  But it's not surprising  But they were called the Orientals  And then he writes  My kids can no longer refer  To those fuzz-covered wires  In school as pipe cleaners  We all remember those  As pipe cleaners, right?

[01:01:00]  I guess because  I never thought about it deeply  Is that what it is?  Yeah  Oh, I thought it was pipe cleaning  Like cleaning someone's pipes  And you fuck them  Maybe because it has a sexual connotation  A pipe cleaner  Yeah  They're just overthinking it  It's a smoking thing  Definitely  They don't want any reference  To any smoking devices  Oh, but no  But no one ever really thought of it like that  You just know  No  I think  I always thought of pipes  In the drain  Oh, no  I never thought of smoking pipes  No, it was for a pipe  You would fucking clean out  All this shit in there 
[01:01:30]  Yeah  The pipe really  Kind of lost its popularity  Over the years  Hasn't it?  Yeah, a little bit  Like I do remember  Go Grandpa  And shit like that  Smoking a pipe around the house  Oh, go down to Brooklyn, man  Yeah, they're still smoking a pipe  Yeah, the hipsters  They're all about the pipes  I was just going to say  Okay, hipsters  But they're not smoking it  For any other reason  But to do that whole ironic thing  Aren't they?  They don't mind smoking  I don't have a pipe  Yeah  Yeah  A gentleman's smoke  The hipsters put on  Flesh pipe  The hipsters put on

Hell no  Sambo was a very popular name  With products back in the day  When no one gave a flying fuck  Yeah  Yeah  Well  Jimmy was trying to turn us on  To a hairy pussy  During the break  He certainly was  Thanks to your fucking talking about it  Yesterday or two days ago  Yeah  I started just looking around  Like, I'm not into that at all  No  And I found a girl 
[01:03:30]  Who has a very large vagina  And it's fucking  Ah  I like that  Dude, I fucking cranked to it yesterday  Wow  I  I  I  I fucking shot a load  Not that anybody wants to know  But if you knew how hard it is  For me to just get up  Watching a girl finger herself  Because that's too tame  Yeah  But I could just hear like  It was so wet  Jesus  But it's really, really hairy  And she has hairy armpits  Which doesn't bother me as much  Hairy legs, though, for me  I can't do  Like, that just feels a little masculine 
[01:04:00]  Something oddly  I can't do hairy legs  No  But the hairy fucking pussy  Is like, oh, her pussy's so big  But you showed us  And it was kind of  It's a big pussy, right?  Fuck  It's a little rough, man  It's not going to be for everybody  I acknowledge that  Okay, good  It's a little  I think it's a little niche  But god damn  I fucking  Ooh, she's sexy  Wow  Porn star  Yeah?  Yeah, they do that  Alt porn and shit  I don't know where they  Fucking shoot it in LA, I guess  Did you join a hair site  Or something  You were telling me?  Yes, I did  I joined a  I couldn't find a lot of video on her 
[01:04:30]  Right  So there was this hairy website  Like where her pictures were  And I just joined it  To look at her  I don't care about the other girls  Right  But she was fingering herself  In one of the videos  I was out of my fucking mind  Just her  Well, everybody wants to know her name  So  Bianca Stone  That's rough, bro  It's a little rough  Yeah, it's not for everybody  Could you zoom in on that whole thing?  It's a very  That's a lot of  That's a hair right there  That's very intimidating  Let's see  Her pussy's so big  I'm out of my mind for it  It's very meaty  Oh, I know  I'm out of my mind for it

Yeah  Wow  There's like the big thatch patch  And then there's the outskirts  The hair around the cesspool  The suburbs of hair  Around the thigh area  And then you lose a little over there  On the crease of the leg  Yes  But then it starts up again  Yeah  That's the crease  Down the thigh 
[01:05:30]  But just something about her  And again, I wish  If she was my wife  I'd probably say  Could you shave the legs, please?  It just feels weird in bed  Yeah  I don't know  All that hair  Holds that musky smell  Exactly  You know, I'm surprised  And I'm not going to get a hair fetish now  You should like that, right?  Just because of the hair  Like a big pussy  Drives me berserk  I was bonkers looking at her yesterday  Yeah  Out of my fucking mind  That  Bonkers over that  Yeah  Well, do you picture her  On her fucking hands and knees?  Because the hair in the asshole 
[01:06:00]  Is like a little weird  But just the fact that  The pussy is so big  Really  There's not much  That doesn't make up for  Is there any other pictures of her?  Oh, yeah, I guess so  But you have to put like  There's a poet named  Bianca Stone  Who I'm not looking at  Yeah, sure  Is that her too?  Yeah  Hairy arms  Yeah  Fuck  Yeah  You know, the hairy armpits  Do nothing for me  Yeah, it's not  It's not that I can take or leave  Like if  Like I wouldn't want her to use deodorant  I wouldn't mind it stinking a little  While we have sex  She makes me feel very earthy

[01:07:00]  I'm not mocking it  I'm just saying  It's a little rough  I mean, I don't quite understand it either  To be honest  The hair fetish  On her, it's like  I think it's sexy  Just because her pussy is so great  Alright  You wouldn't let her  Fucking sit on your face  After the gym  No  Oh my god  No  Spit on the elliptical  I would fucking treat it  Like a diving bell  I would just breathe  Yeah  Nice  Big pussy, man  Fuck  We went through that shit  Growing up  That was all we had  That's all we had

[01:11:00]  As dozens of other  Guests were evacuated  Off the ride  Everybody was able  To evacuate  In the front  And the back  But we got stuck  And we were left there  While I was going  Through a traumatic  Experience  Oh  Disney employees  Helped him onto the ride  But Martinez says  He was told  They couldn't help him  Where they stopped  No one came to us  Which I felt  Was another  You know  Potential deadly  Situation  Deadly  This guy's a drama queen  This guy's a drama queen 
[01:11:30]  Nice legs  What was deadly about it  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  Annoying  Yes  Annoying  It's an inconvenience  But where's the deadly part  Setting up for Lussert  Yes  Of course  Because the water  I remember  You could see the bottom  It was maybe six inches  He's in a boat  You're in a dumb little boat  And those little  Fucking things  Are all over  Singing the songs  Right  They all look the same  Except they're dressed  One's in a lederhosen  One's in a fucking kimono  And the other one's  In a cowboy hat  Right  Depending on which curve  You go around  Right 
[01:12:00]  But  Deadly  How is it  It's annoying  Not deadly  Why if I said  They want us to roll  To the first aid  I don't think I'm going to make it  Roll them  Well they were going to get to them  Eventually  They had a situation on their hands  They didn't know how to get them  Off the boat  Oh  Because where those things stopped  Yeah  Oh  Martinez said for 40 minutes  He suffered from dysreflexia  What  A condition experienced by those  With spinal cord injuries  Caused by stress  And overstimulation 
[01:12:30]  It can lead to a stroke  Or death  There are procedures in place  For evacuating people  There are not procedures in place  For evacuating people  Come this way  Turn up legs  That's  Wait what  Yeah  Goofy and Mickey  Each grab one  Fucking  One of those weird decorations  Below his knees  Pick up those useless things  And let's get a move on  Wow  No one's beating that today 
[01:13:00]  Bravo  Roll them  You think Goofy would help them?  Goofy would not even help them in the least  Fuck them  Leave them there  There are not procedures in place  For evacuating people with disabilities  That's the quintessential  Different treatment  It's discrimination  In its parents' form  Oh boy  It is purest  The Disability Rights Legal Center in Los Angeles  Has taken Martinez's case  Claiming Disneyland is in violation of federal and state laws 
[01:13:30]  And is not prepared to evacuate disabled guests  In the event of an emergency  It's about having  You know  Theme parks that are accessible  And this is Disneyland for crying out loud  Exactly  Oh my god  What are you going to do?  Don't fuck with the mouse  This is our house, bitch  What are you going to do?  What an asshole  You think Goofy would insult his legs?  Of course  Hey, look at me run 
[01:14:00]  If you're a quadriplegic  Wouldn't you kind of ask some questions  And look at the ride and go  Man, if this thing  There's no way out of here  If this thing gets stuck  I don't know if I'm going to get out of here right away  Yeah  No?  Yeah  I don't know  What are you going to do?  He's got pretzel legs  Leave him alone  Did he say?  How much did he get?  I think he got 8,000  8 G's?  8 large?  I think it was an easy quick one for Disney  Yeah  Didn't I read that somewhere? 
[01:14:30]  I heard it was 8,000, right?  Yeah, a lot of people are confirming that now  They are?  Getting confirmation  You're sure?  8,000  Yeah  Yes  Why only 8,000?  No, it's 2,000 per useless limb  Jesus  Wow  They judge what you might have earned  For the rest of your life  And they're like  Well, how much do we pay paperweight?  Oh, shit  And then times it by 2  Wait 
[01:15:00]  Oh  It was like  What are your legs?  Like small world legs or something?  Hey  We have to go to the hotline  Oh, right  Something popped up late last night  Oh, did you jack it?  I jacked it  Wicked Tuna  Oh, right  Yeah, yeah  I'm a big fan of the Wicked Tuna  And it's on Nat Geo  It's on Sundays at 9  Yeah  And we started talking about Wicked Tuna a little bit  A couple weeks ago  And then one of the guys that is  I don't know  Has a connection to one of the Wicked Tuna boats 
[01:15:30]  Uh-huh  That is featured on the show  Offered me a  Ride out on the boat?  Ride out on the boat  And maybe try to catch some tuna  Or at least check it out as they catch the tuna  And I said, hell yeah  But then it turned out this guy's boat sank or something  And he was waiting  He was waiting to get the boat back, you know, up and running  Uh-huh  Now there's another Wicked Tuna guy that's on the line right now  And he's really pissed off about the whole thing  I think  Or he wants to clear up some things 
[01:16:00]  I'm kind of confused myself  Let him clear up some things  Well, we certainly said that we would, you know, take his phone call today  So it's Dave  Dave Marciano  Dave, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show  Hey guys, what's going on, man?  How are you?  Oh, we're doing well, man  How are you?  Good, good, good  Living the dream  Living the dream  Well, that's good  Now, I'm kind of confused here  What happened?  Well, I mean, regardless of what, you know, things are said and what happened 
[01:16:30]  You know, you guys have seen it enough that  You know, over the years with an older boat like mine  You know, mine's, you know, an oldest boat  The show  It was built in 1984  So every now and then we seem to have some technical difficulties  But regardless of what happens  You know, I've become an expert over the years  At putting Humpty Dumpty back together again  And getting back in the game  And that's what's important  Right?  So, so is, is the boat, is the boat okay? 
[01:17:00]  So the guy that, uh, hold on, hold on, maybe I can help out here  Oh, yeah  Dave is the real deal, by the way  Oh, yeah  Now, Dave, the guy that contacted me on Twitter, does he work for you?  Uh, I don't know  I don't know who it was  So I have no idea who it was  I didn't hear the show  It was just some of my fans contacted me  So it just got a little weird  I was like, oh, all right  Well, I'll see what's up, you know  Oh, so is your, so it's not your boat that's out of commission right now? 
[01:17:30]  Well, the boat is hauled out  And we're, you know, we're making some modifications to her  But, you know, look it, I support my family through fishing  So, you know, any time, yeah, I have problems with the boats over the years  We straighten them out, we can pack in the game  Uh-huh  Yeah, I don't know what the problem is, though  If this guy was just telling me that he would, you know, take me for a ride, man  But you're not sure if it's the guy connected to you  Yeah, no, I know it's not my crew  Jay's a great guy 
[01:18:00]  You see, my crew, the only guys that work for me is Jay  And, uh, um, my, my, my son, right?  Now, it wouldn't surprise me if one of the other skippers from the show contacted you  To throw me under the bus  You know, that kind of happens all the time  Hmm, I don't know what's going on  Uh, one of the boats, one of the boats was, um  Down, but it's, it's not out  It's not down and out  He's saying that he thinks that some, one of the other shippers  What's that?  I know  Shippers said that his boat was sunk 
[01:18:30]  You know, to make him look bad  Oh, did they say that, Dave?  You know, one of the other schoolgirls got their panties all up in a bunch  Oh  Now he's throwing some, uh, throwing some chum  I like it  Dave, uh  You know, the office still stands  If you guys want to get out here and go fishing this summer  You know, uh, I'll definitely take you out  And I'll show you  I'll show you that I have merchandise  You know, it's a real boat  And it's always in the game  And, you know, if you've seen it before 
[01:19:00]  I might get knocked down  You know, if you watched the last episode  I get knocked down  But I always get back up  You sure do  I'm trying to  Unfortunately, I can't find the tweet  So I can, like, figure out what the hell's going on  So you're saying one of the other boat guys is kind of, uh, taking shots at you  Possibly  I don't know  I don't know who the tweet was  I didn't see it myself and everything  Somebody help me out on Twitter right now  Just send me the guy's tweet or the guy's Twitter account  So I could, uh, figure this out with Dave 
[01:19:30]  Dave, when, uh, when does tuna season start?  Um, for us, generally around June 1st is when it opens by law  Um, and there, you know, we're allowed to begin harvesting  Now, uh, that being said  You know, we're dealing with fish  And the fish deal with conditions  You know, water temperature  Amounts of bait  But, uh, so they show up when the conditions are right for them  But it opens by law June 1st  And usually, sometimes it's right on June 1st  They're out there waiting for us 
[01:20:00]  Uh, but I suspect this year  You know, we're going to have to wait for that water temperature  To heat up a little bit  Before they get here and, you know, get thick enough to target  Right, now, what's the biggest tuna you've caught?  1,200 pounds is my personal best  E-Rock  1,200 pounds?  Wait, what's the biggest on Wicked Tuna so far?  Um, I think, uh, one of the other boats, Kevin, in season one on the Christina  He had one that was like 1,100 and something 
[01:20:30]  So he, that was a really sweet fish  Now that I'm a fan of Wicked Tuna  You guys fish for other stuff as well, right?  Compliments  Yeah, generally, like I fish year-round  Or at least I used to  Now, the ground fish industry in New England  Has gone through some major changes  In the past, um, you know, 10 years or so  Uh, as we try to rebuild other stocks of fish  Like cod, haddock, and pollock  Fists that everybody likes to eat  Right, um, Kevin Pollock  So, you know, you know, we've had some difficulty 
[01:21:00]  In trying to stay employed, uh, year-round  You know, in the past, say, 10 years ago  I used to make a paycheck  Just running my boat, uh, alone, right?  But nowadays, um, because of the regulations  And the cutbacks  In order to, uh, rebuild some of the other stocks of fish  You know, I, I run my boat  I'll go a skipper on another boat  I run a boat out of the bed seat  And target monkfish for a few months  Like a mercenary  Look at you  Yeah, basically a mercenary 
[01:21:30]  I guess that's the way you could say it  But, you know, for me, the bottom line is  That's my job is fishing  So, you know, I'm not too proud  If I get to go on deck for a trip  And be a mate for a trip  I can do that, too  You know, whatever it takes  And how long?  Because, you know, it's a half-hour TV show  Or an hour, I forget, hour, whatever  Hour TV show  Yeah, it's not an hour show  I guess it's 42 minutes  After they add in the commercials  Yeah, but how many hours are you out there  Before you get something?  Oh, well, yeah, I mean  And that's definitely the part 
[01:22:00]  That, you know, you guys don't see  Probably, if you saw it too efficient  How it really was  It would be about as exciting  As watching grass grow  Really?  We invested  I love that show  A lot of time  And waiting  Because that's  You know, what you guys see  Is just the highlights  Of course, right?  Because it's TV  And you pretty much  You pretty much only catch one a day  If you're lucky, right?  Because then you've got to get it back in quickly  Yeah, you know, we're allowed  Up to three a day by law  Of the Giants  You know, what they do 
[01:22:30]  Is they change that number  Like if we're catching the quota  Early in the season  If we're catching the quota fast  They'll drop it to two fish a day  Or even one fish a day  But the point is that  You know, you're lucky to get one a day  Yeah, oh yeah  I know  If we get a fish  If we get one fish  We can make a paycheck out of that  And then it's bonus time  You go back out there  Hoping you can get one more  But the odds are  I guess you're getting two in a day, right?  Sure  You know, we have times 
[01:23:00]  When the fishing's good  You know, where we might  You know, get two  Or even three a day  But that's certainly not the norm  Without a doubt  I just don't understand  Because these guys are  Going for tuna  And they gotta just figure it out  And they have to fucking  Have a tuna come around  And fucking  Take a bite off their shit  Bite that hook  Unbelievable  Crazy  Right  You know, and a lot of it again  Like we spend  We might fish  You know, for four days  To get that one fish for the week 
[01:23:30]  Yeah  That's when we get paid  For the four days  We were out there waiting  You know, with our putt in our head  Right, yeah  In the end  There's not a lot of money  To go around  If you're waiting four days  You got a crew  You got maintenance on your boat  And your hood  And your shit  Yeah  No, no, look  You know, that's the story  Of commercial fishing  In New England  You know  That's a funny word  There's a lot of good guys  That go fishing in New England  For a living, you know  And it's a great industry  To be a part of  Right 
[01:24:00]  But one thing  It's always been  Is it's never been stable  You know, we're not like you guys  We don't get a check  Every week  No matter what  You know, there's weeks  Where I don't put your fish  I don't get a paycheck  I've worked all week  All I can do is  You know, we have to look at it  At the end of a season  Yeah, we even  At the end of the season  At the end of the season  You know, did I make a check?  Did Jay make a check?  Did the fuel bill get paid?  Did the mortgage get paid?  Did the insurance get paid?  And it's, you know  A lot of times for us  It seems like it's a rarity  When at the end of a season 
[01:24:30]  Gotcha  You know, after you're out  And fixing your boat  Everything  Yeah, we  We even get paid  When we're not here  Oh, it's amazing  Wow, I want a job like that  All right, Dave  You're my favorite on the show now  Because you called us  Of course  Dave Marciano  From Wicked Tuna  I really do like the show  When's the next season  Start up again?  I mean, for TV  For TV  Oh, I don't know  I mean, it's in season 2 now  If you guys have been watching 
[01:25:00]  Sunday night  At 9 o'clock  Was episode 9  Yep  There's going to be  15 episodes this season  Yep  And though there's been  Some big changes  You know, if you've been  Keeping up with the show  You know, Paul got fired  Off the Tuna.com again  Yep  You know, there was another  Chick fight over there  Yeah  So, you know  Now Paul's going to wind up  On another boat  It looks like  Right  All right, Dave  It really is a good show  I really enjoy it  And I don't know  Where the confusion was  I still don't know  What the hell happened  But I'd love to go 
[01:25:30]  On your boat  Maybe this summer  Oh, yeah  Yeah, well, that's it  You know, you guys  Have my contact data  You know, through  The people who contacted you  At any time  And I'm always watching  On Twitter, too  I'm following you guys  On Twitter  I'll keep an eye on things  You know  Right on  Just give me a shout out  And we'll get you  On the boat  You'll see for yourself  What a great rig show  I would love to check it out  So it's capped  Capped  C-A-P-T  Marciano  On Twitter  Thanks, Dave  All right 
[01:26:00]  Thank you guys  Thank you very much  For a chance to  Clear the air  Certainly  All right, brother  Later  Bye-bye  Obviously, he has pride  In what he does  But I don't know  I don't know what's going on  I didn't understand  Sounds like a big fish story  To me  Ah, good one  Very good one  I think another  I think another guy  From another boat  Offered me  You know  The experience of tuna fishing  But then had to admit  That his boat's  Not happening right now  Right  And then somehow  That pissed off Dave  Because then I think  It made the industry 
[01:26:30]  Itself look bad  Maybe  I don't know  I have no idea  I don't know  But he really wanted  To talk to us today  I just know that the fishermen  Seem to be just like  The truckers  That's very lonely  Out there on the water  I think  And they like to talk  They can be out there  Easily 12, 16 hours  Without catching anything  Yeah  For a couple days  And they finally get  The big tuna  Yes  They pull their puds  Sam's saying  They pull their puds  Well, that's what he said  I learned that  From the interview  He just said  We're out there 
[01:27:00]  Pulling our puds  Pulling our puds  Pud  It's a hilarious word  For a cock  I love using that word  Pud  Mmm  Ah boy  Fishing  I ain't going  You wouldn't go fishing  Fuck no  To check out tuna fishing  I would get so sick  You would get sick  I can't  Yeah, I get seasick  On those fishing boats  I go on a cruise boat  We're going on a cruise  But I can't  Ah, I love fishing  I can't go on a fishing boat 
[01:27:30]  I used to do it a lot  Growing up  Not so much these days  I would love to check that out  Never really went deep  Deep sea fishing  Deep sea fishing  We went for the blues  And the stripers  Yeah  And the flounder  Most of the time  You got those ugly sea bass  It's stinky  What, fish?  Fishing is a smelly business  Yeah  It smells like fish  Yeah  And it's very sloppy  You get like fish guts  And scales on you  Are we talking about  Jim's favorite woman again? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, the hairy woman  I love her  She's so sexy, dude  Very similar to fishing  Yeah  Bianca's a very good girl  She smells like the bilge  Of fucking  She's got a little bait  Down there  Captain Marciano's boat  You don't like a pussy like that, too?  Like a big fucking meaty pussy?  Oh, makes me crazy  I like them, uh  Standard  I like the standard issue  The sloppier the better for Jimmy  I don't need no extra parts  But I didn't say sloppy  I don't mean  That's good when it comes to sandwiches  I don't mean it like a fucked pussy  I don't like a neat sandwich  You want to get a sandwich 
[01:28:30]  With a lot of meat  Hanging out of the side of the roll  There you go, right  A lot of different juices  And spreads and stuff  Right, right, right  Not a vagina  Not a vagina, not so much  I'm just the opposite  Not so much  I like a nice, neat, liverwurst sandwich  With the lettuce not even sticking out  Yeah  Yeah, gentleman sandwich  Some olive loaf  No, I don't like olive  Olive loaf  Iraq loves the olive  Iraq loves it  I don't know why  Because he looks like one  Oh  He's a human olive loaf  That was his nickname in high school  Olive loaf boy  Olive loaf  Hey look, here comes olive loaf 
[01:29:00]  He'd walk in with pimento on his cheek  Yeah  Other olive loaf thing in his hair  You know, speaking of fish  I saw Life of Pi last night  I decided I was going to watch it  Now, before you  I want to jump in  For one second  Jump right in  A lot of people  Either love the movie  Or fucking hate it  There's no in between here  Yeah  They think it's a really  An amazing movie  Inspiring  And a good story 
[01:29:30]  And other people are like  This is a bunch of bullshit  I'm kind of  The first in between then  Because  Really?  It was alright  It was good  But I'm not like  Oh my god  It was amazing  Yeah  They kind of throw you  For a loop at the end  Don't tell me  I didn't see it  What happens  Don't tell me  Oh no  And the  Boy, that CGI tiger  Is pretty fucking impressive  I must say  Is it?  Yeah  They put him in  With a couple of shots  Of a real tiger  And stuff  But it looks  Pretty fucking  You never

[01:30:30]  Some, uh  Some guy  Telling a fucking story  About him being shipwrecked  Right  And, um  You're not quite sure  If the story's true or not  Holy fuck  That looks fake  That looks fake  What the fuck  No, it's pretty goddamn good  I'll tell you one thing though  Watch it  It's very, um  The scenes on the ocean  Right  Uh  Really give you the illusion  That he's in the middle  Of fucking nowhere  Right  But watching it on the 90 inch  Yeah 
[01:31:00]  I was literally getting queasy  Like there were some parts  Where they're just showing  The boat rolling  And pitching  And stuff like that  And I'm like  Holy shit  I started getting like  A motion thing  3D?  Going  No, it wasn't 3D  It was just regular  Like watching it on TV  It was fucked up  And then it rains  I gotta look away  Then it rains fish or something  Or a whale jumps over the boat  A whale jumps over  And, you know  There's that phosphorus stuff  In the water  So it's glowing  Right  And everything like that  But, uh  You know  It looks good  That Ang Lee  Uh  He can direct a movie 
[01:31:30]  Yeah  Uh  It looks very, you know  Very nice  Very grand  Very epic  But, um  The story is  You know  It's a cool little story  Uh  Something you don't know  By the end  If you don't know  If, you know  He made it up  Right  I'll see it and tell you  How I fucking feel about it  Oh  You do that, Jimmy  Ah, life of pie  What the hell do I know?  You bake it  You eat it  That's the life of a pie  Have a container of coffee  Nice slice of pumpkin pie  Pumpkin pie, yuck  Stupid fucking  Pumpkin pie, not bad  Regular joke 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, you give me  A piece of apple pie  Maybe a piece of cobbler  Yeah  Yeah, a little dessert  In my lunch pail  We never got to  Uh, the  Uh, was it Joe Forrester  Uh, show  That I saw the  Oh, right  Promo for  It's so bad  Why didn't we get to that  It's regular joke  I guess we got interrupted  By something  We're very busy  We always get interrupted  By something  Very bussy yesterday  Um, Joe Forrester  You got a, uh  Video clip of it  Perhaps  Go to videos  And see if there's 
[01:32:30]  Like the  Is that the, um  Yeah, this might be it  Alright, crank  Crank the volume up  Listen to this  It's so 70s  Oh, sorry  Lloyd Bridges  The introduction  Of a new  Realistic law enforcement  Series  Joe Forrester  Realistic  Look how he takes  This guy down  Last year  An episode  Of Police Story  Joe is a dedicated  Conscious  Oh  He throws a night stick  At his legs  And trips him  Fighting crime 
[01:33:00]  Fighting crime  How long did you get  Off that bus  About two hours ago  Where from  Bakersfield  And you met Plums  At the bus terminal  Right  Yeah, he's been so nice  I bet  What an actress  Just do as I did  Now shut up  Put your hands back there  There are times  When Joe's not thinking  About crime  We've got a beautiful  Thing going here  But there's nothing  Beautiful about the  Prospect of being  Gunned down by a hood  By a hood  He's shooting at Joe  Jumps over the car  As opposed to ducking 
[01:33:30]  Around it  Yeah  John  We don't think  It was a random  Sniping  What are you getting at?  We want to take you  Off the beat  No, damn it, no  Because it wins your life  The average arm robber  Goes a mile out of his way  To a boy, a cop  Let alone kill one  That's a theory  I'm not quite sure  It's true anymore  How can I ever face  The people on my feet  If I run away  Really because some  Punk  With a rifle  Takes a couple of shots  At a blue uniform  And a black and white  Pause  Pause for some  You sure this isn't  Tongue in cheek 
[01:34:00]  A little bit  Dude, right  It's so bad  His acting's horrendous  Lloyd Bridges  Was a horrible actor  It's one hell of a program  You like it, Joe?  It was a terrific program  It was all the guys  Up there doing his job  And all of a sudden  They're taking pot shots  Just like me on the job site  Ah, see?  I don't cut corners  This guy's good  It ran from 75 to 76  Yeah  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah  Joe Forrester  Keep going  Shots at a blue uniform  And a black and white 
[01:34:30]  You want a beat, Joe?  Yeah, that neighborhood  Has gone downhill enough  You gotta give me half a chance  To build it up again  You're a beat, huh?  Tell me  What would the department do  If it found out  This guy you busted  Bought you a new shirt?  Oh, listen  If a beat cop's gonna worry  About what the department thinks  You'll never get any work done  The city's not gonna buy me  A new shirt  He erected a knee  Yeah, how are you?  Well, then he's gonna have to  Come up with a 26-40  And that doesn't mean  That I won't bust him again  If I have to  All right 
[01:35:00]  And he pays up another shirt  And he pays for another shirt  That's the beat  That's the beat  Oh, he's playing golf  No, this is some guy  Golfing into traffic  Hey, what?  Are you nuts?  How you doing there, old buddy?  You should have seen  The one I did over at the Chevy  Oh, oh, oh  Joe Forrest  Is trying to get the golf club  From him  Mind if I give it a try?  Oh, it looks a little violent  But Joe knows how to handle him  Yeah  Now he's giving Joe the golf club 
[01:35:30]  Instead of beating him  Over the head with it  And Joe's gonna play a little golf  Into traffic  Why would he do this?  He's shooting  He's hitting a golf ball  Into traffic  He wouldn't  A car?  Oh, Ron  You don't mean you're here  To say hello  What the fuck's wrong?  Isn't the acting  And dialogue  I don't get what happens  It's so bad  Joe's calming a maniac  And playing golf with him  But he just  Hit a golf ball in the traffic  And the guy goes  A cop?  Like, who wrote this shit?  Wow  It's so bad 
[01:36:00]  Joe Forrest is fucking great  Joe Forrest  He's not just on the beat  Play the black woman now  Now they have the black woman  And him talking  Oh, Ron  You don't mean you're here  To say hello and goodbye  All at the same time  Maybe not  Maybe I'll be back  A lot of people around here  Seem to think that I'm needed  Kind of like the idea  Of having an officer  On the beat  Gives them a feeling  Of security  They say  Hey, you know what?  You  You promise

The hottest vacation spot  Is practically in your own backyard  Visit Devil's Creek  In the heart of downtown Edison, New Jersey  Here's the founder of the Devil's Creek Tourism Board  James Norton 
[01:40:00]  Who's going to share with you  Some of his fond memories  Of this beautiful vacation destination  I have a really weird  Vague memory  Of my pants around my ankles  On the steps in this apartment building  When there was an older boy  Um  An older boy  Who used to make me suck his penis  He's got to be older  I think he tried to fuck me in the butt once  But it didn't work  First you'll fly into picturesque Newark, New Jersey  Then you'll whisk away southbound  On the scenic New Jersey turnpike  To beautiful Edison Township  Where you'll be a hop, skip  And a jump away from Devil's Creek  Where your fantasies 
[01:40:30]  Become a reality  It was these twins  I would get both of them  At different times  To sit on my face  Because they used to pee their pants  So I liked that smell  Yeah  And that would make them sit on my face  Behind the bushes  So I could smell  I remember my one friend  I was sucking his penis  And we got caught by another friend  He's the same one  That fucking crazy  He's the same one  That urinated in my mouth  For memories that'll last a lifetime  Even the suppressed ones  Come visit us at Devil's Creek  I don't think I got erection to that age  I can remember my friend's penis getting erect  And me wondering  Why'd that happen with his penis  Like I didn't know what that was 
[01:41:00]  It was in your mouth  Jesus Christ  The hoover kid  Devil's Creek  If you don't leave crying  We're not trying hard enough  Serious XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  E-Rock has decided not to listen to us today  Apparently not  He's turning this into Lady Gaga day  Good guy  I don't know  Remember that fucking Andy Rooney bit 
[01:41:30]  When he was saying  I don't know much about Lady Gaga  Gaga  He called her Lady Gaga  I don't know much about Lady Gaga  Oh brother  I just want to say  The NAACP  I guess there's a local chapter  In  Where the hell is it  Steubensville  That rape case  Right  Yeah  He's saying  That she was a  Drunk willing participant  The head of the NAACP there 
[01:42:00]  That's good  Saying you know  And calling her the alleged victim  Wow  Yeah yeah  Let's see if the women's groups attack him  And not a fucking peep  Yeah you know  When did he say this?  I'm trying to find a god damn story  Oh here it is  NAACP president  In shocking comments  The Steubenville chapter  President of the Steubenville chapter  In the NAACP  Places blame for the rape case  That has shocked the nation 
[01:42:30]  On the 16 year old victim  Royal Mayo  His name is Royal Mayo  Damn  Jesus  How jealous of you Iraq  Oh right  That is a name right there  It's a great name right  A lifelong resident of the Ohio City  That gained notoriety  I guess he said this yesterday  Calls the woman  The alleged victim  Saying she was drunk  And wanted to go out  With one of the football players  Of course he's bringing up 
[01:43:00]  Some racial dynamic  Of the community  Oh yeah of course  What a fucking  And will anyone  Call him out on this  Because I'll tell you  If it was just some  Average white guy  Of course  They would fucking crucify him  He wouldn't have a job  He would  But this guy  Royal Mayo  Oh my god  Unbelievable  But because he's the  President to some  Local shit chapter  Of the NAACP 
[01:43:30]  They won't say anything  About him  I guess they'll just  Let him say those  Horrid comments  Blaming the victim  It really amazes me  Sometimes  With this whole  Marriage thing  Marriage equality  Homosexual thing  And you get these  Black pastors  And leaders  Saying that  Gays shouldn't be  Able to get married  You turn around  And oppress people  It's astounding  Black people hate  When gay rights 
[01:44:00]  Are equated  With civil rights  Because their argument  Is well  We don't have a choice  Being black  You have a choice  Being gay  But they hate  When those two things  Are tied together  That is kind of  An up in the air thing  About having a choice  Of course  I think it's both  As a matter of fact  I think people are born  Absolutely born gay  And yeah  You can just tell  But then there are  Other people  That you know  Like white  People that want  To be black  Like the wiggers  That choose to  Put on that persona 
[01:44:30]  And live that lifestyle  I think there are  Gay people  That aren't born gay  But then they kind of  Like that lifestyle  And want to  You know  Get in there  Get some of that ass  Right?

[01:50:30]  Like I sign here  Like he doesn't quite know  What he's signing  And he's looking  It's so subtle  And just so fucking well done  That's easy  You like this  You like this  Alright let me see Jimmy  Go ahead  Here  Perfect  Kevin Pollack's back on the line  You nailed it  Kevin  Yeah no  I blame Steve Jobs  That fuck  For making the iPhone  So my ear can hang up on me  That's what it was  Yep  That's exactly what happened  Kevin  Yeah 
[01:51:00]  God  And was telling that  I'd like to call back  To make sure you guys understood  Yes  I said and turned into  Some freak  Alright  And I was talking about  Your acting skills  Yeah  I love that subtle  Little look  You give when you're  Signing the documents  And you look up  Like I sign here  Kind of a  A weird little  Like facial thing  But that was very good  You were very fucking good  In that  In Casino  I must say  Thank you  I appreciate that very much  It's probably because 
[01:51:30]  I was scared shitless  Being in over my head  Did you think you were  In over your head  Yeah  Oh fuck  That's one of those jobs  That every  The first week at least  Every day you wait  For someone to knock  On the treadmill  And say  Yeah  We've made a horrible error  Oh fuck  We thought  It was Kevin Spacey  Could you come with that  Oh fuck  Yeah  Someone else we were  Looking for  Oh yeah  But no the best part  Was Rickles  Watching Rickles  Go after De Niro  That really was  The thrill  As amazing as it was 
[01:52:00]  To act in the movie  And work with Scorsese  And De Niro  And all the big shots  Watching Rickles  Go after De Niro  Was by far the best  And De Niro enjoyed it  Right  He loved the shit out of it  Oh my god  Because it turns out  Rickles knew that  De Niro had worshipped him  Since he was a kid  That in part  News got to  Rickles  And Rickles basically  Knew he owned De Niro  Yeah  Where everyone else  You know  They treat him  With such reverence  On the set  It's absurd  And Rickles is just  Shitting all over him  That's great 
[01:52:30]  In the middle of a take  Is that the way  You're going to do it  Like that  I'm sure you know  What you're doing  Go ahead  With De Niro laugh  Oh I  Shoot that huge  De Niro mugging laugh  Oh shit  Yeah  That's great man  That's how you're going to do it  I guess you know  Alright  I guess you know  Yeah  And Pesci got mad at him  You said right  Oh Pesci was pissed  Yeah  Wow  Because Rickles said  He was so short  He was going to ride him  On the set  Like a Shetland phone  Holy fuck  In front of 200 people  At the wedding scene 
[01:53:00]  Extras you know  And then Pesci just didn't  Yeah you're a fucking riot  Rickles  Now I get it  I get it  I'm a midget  And you're a genius  Go fuck  Was it awkward  Was it awkward after that  What's that  Was it awkward  Was it awkward  Or  Oh yeah  No it was extremely awkward  Because Rickles wouldn't stop  So that made it more awkward  And they wanted to try to kiss him  You know  Come here Joe  Come here  Come here Joe  You know  It was just  And then you can just see  That Pesci really truly did  Want to rip off his head 
[01:53:30]  And shit down  Was that  Were people laughing  Everyone was laughing  Except for Joe  Oof  Wow  I guess Rickles  That was awkward as fuck  Did Rickles seem nervous  Did Rickles seem nervous  Around De Niro  No  No  It was the weirdest thing  In the world  Everyone else  You could hear  The sphincter titan  When he walked by  But Rickles  For some reason  He just knew  I own this kid  And he was fucking fearless  Wow  Plus I guess  After Sinatra  And being who you are  For that  He was so famous  Before De Niro ever was 
[01:54:00]  It's just different  Oh god yes  Yeah  I think that's in a nutshell  For sure  Nothing frightens him  At this point  No no  He told fucking Sinatra  To fuck off  I mean  Yeah  Wow  That's old school  Yeah  Yeah exactly  Nice  Yeah  Alright Mr. Pollock  Alright thanks guys  I literally really did  Just need to get that out  Man I'm sorry  No worries  DC Improv  For Kevin Pollock  This weekend  Great club  Alright miss you guys  Thanks man  Thank you  Come back and see us  Kevin Pollock everyone  Yeah  You gotta love Rickles  For that  Just a comic

[01:55:30]  To our aggressive  Educational  Reform efforts  I'm so tired  I can't sleep  So that here  In this theater  Standing on the edge  They're talking  About our commitment  To the spirit  Of Boston  It's just  Live  Learn  Prepare  2013  We'll also make 
[01:56:00]  Boston the premier  City  Of working women  I said that  Our waterfront  Should not turn  Into anywhere  USA  Instead  Through creative  We're giving some  Insistence  Assistance  It's becoming a model  For the country  For how to rebuild 
[01:56:30]  The economy  Around new  And growing  Industries  Weep  Weep  Not  For  The men  Bofferson  Is a perfect  Fit  For the world  Classic  Wow  Tearing up over here  Very good  Yes  Very emotional  My god  Fucking haunting  You will be missed  Bofferson  Bofferson  All the features  In there  I was starting to  Think after a while  That we kind of 
[01:57:00]  Exaggerated  The way he said  Bofferson  Or made it up  Right  You know  He said  Fucking Bofferson  Yes he did  The city  He's been mayor  Of forever  More than once  Too  And he can't  Pronounce the name  Of it  That's astounding  Well we're looking  At former governor  McGreevy  On morning  Joe  He's going to be  In the building  Today  Is he really  Yeah I want to  Go over and say  Jim  Oh  He pretty much  Gave up on  Trying to look  Heterosexual 
[01:57:30]  Huh  Where is he  He's  That's him  It's a woman  On screen  Of course  There he is  He's got the  Little radio wizard  Glasses on  Yes  And lifestyle  What is he  A priest now  Or something  He's a gay  American  Well we know that  Fall to grace  Not fall from grace  Fall to grace  Yeah what's his  What's his fucking  Deal now  I don't know  I don't know  I think he's  Like a priest  No way  I think so  Why would you 
[01:58:00]  Go gay  Tell everyone  You're gay  And then give up  What you want to do  For being gay  Why make the  Announcement right  McGreevy calls  The different sense  Of understanding  Of where gay rights  Are in this country  And so  My dream  Is that at some point  In terms of young  Women and men  Growing up  That they will have  A very different sense  Of self narrative  Of themselves  And of this nation  In terms of gay rights  So to paraphrase  Martin King badly 
[01:58:30]  That the arc of liberty  The arc of freedom  In this country  Does move in the right direction  And I ultimately believe  That Americans will embrace that  So that people do it  Young people do it  In a far more healthy  And appropriate way  Than I did  Do you think  Do you think  If you were in  If August 12, 2004  Were  Well  That's 2004  2004 that was  Huh  He's a priest  When he stumbled out  Of the closet  He's a priest right  He's a priest  And he's got a documentary  Coming out  Wait  He's pushing  He's a celibate priest 
[01:59:00]  He's an Episcopal priest  What is that  I think Episcopal  What do you  I think Episcopal  You could do 10 years  I think  I think maybe just the ass  Chip  I don't know  Chip  Why were you laughing  At Episcopal  Episcopal  He's roaring over here  Ah  Chipper  You sure  Being shit  Must be a pisser  Just laugh at everything 
[01:59:30]  Great  No I don't  Oh  I have a good sense of humor  Yeah do you  I enjoyed that  You  The first sentence you said  Was  He's given up  On looking heterosexual  Yeah  And then the second sentence  You said was  He's got his radio wizard glasses  Yeah  Yeah I am kind of  Where's that guy  Alluding to the fact  That those glasses  Are a little  Quee  Quay  A little queebish  Where's he  He's here today I believe 
[02:00:00]  He was in D.C. yesterday  Making sure everything  Was okay there  What  He was in D.C. yesterday  Why would he have to go to D.C.  What's there for him to do there  I don't know  He's probably got music stuff  Doing over there  He can't do that over the computer  Or phone  Right  Skype  Skype that shit  There's no reason to go  Anywhere  Anymore  Especially when you have  A nonsense job  To begin with  Oh god  You know he's not there  Literally turning a wrench  On a piece of equipment  So everything can be done  From a fucking email account 
[02:00:30]  Weird  It's weird that we didn't even know  He was gone yesterday  Jesus  I think this gay marriage thing  I think this country needs  A few more years  Is what it comes down to  Yeah  A few more years  I think we'll ever have  A gay president  Supposedly we already had one  I don't know  That one guy  The one guy  We've talked about him  Yeah  Yeah  All the features  All the features were there  Yeah  Help me out  Yeah  I'm trying to think 
[02:01:00]  We did this break already  The country is never ready  For the real change though  Lincoln  Jesus  E-Rock  They just put a movie  Out about him  And not  A fucking  Not a hint  What the fuck  Of his sexuality  Lincoln  E-Rock  Please comment E-Rock  People still think he's gay  What  What  Was it the hat  Made it look like a penis helmet  Was it the shot to the head  Right  It's not the first time  He had a shot to his head 
[02:01:30]  E-Rock  All right  Here's the answer  It's James Buchanan  Who lived with  William Rufus King  Yes  Remember we did this bit  Read this thing  All right  For many years in D.C.  Prior to the presidency  James Buchanan  Lived with  William Rufus King  Who was earlier  Vice President  Under  Franklin Pierce  Under  So he lived with  A past vice president  Just imagine  This is  Even worse  King was referred to 
[02:02:00]  By Andrew Jackson  As Miss Nancy  That was like  A big fuck  That's like saying  Faggot  That's big  Back then  Aaron Brown  Called him  Buchanan's  Better half  Yes  Wow  It wasn't Lincoln  It wasn't Lincoln  It wasn't Lincoln  Iraq  Buchanan  Do we have a picture  Of Buchanan  Or a painting  Something  Yeah  Let's see what he looks like  Is he handsome  We did this bit  I think he was wearing  The cape still 
[02:02:30]  Way past  The point of  Presidents  Wearing the cape  He started the whole  Wig thing  They were just embarrassed  The president  With such a  Frutal  Jim Jeffries  Take a seat  We're talking about  Our president  Buchanan  Who apparently  Might have been gay  Yes  I don't know  How we got on this  Oh  Will we ever have  A gay president  I said  There's rumors  That we already had one  And his name is  James Buchanan  Of course  You'll have a gay one  Eventually  Eventually  I'm saying  You might have  Yeah 
[02:03:00]  Yeah  Well  I think  A lot  Yeah  You know what  It's funny  But I think  We'd have a lesbian  President  Before we have  A gay man president  An openly gay  Yeah  Yeah  Flamboyant  Well  Buchanan lived with  An ex-vice president  And who was called  Nancy  The vice president  That he lived with  The former vice president  That he lived with  Yeah  The guy he lived with  As he was president  Was he living with this guy  Before he was president  William Rufus King  Yeah  Toss him to the curb  Before he went to  Fucking 1600  Yeah 
[02:03:30]  He's gay  He's gay  And they called him Nancy  Miss Nancy  Miss Nancy  Oh you mean Miss Nancy  Over there  Right  And weren't there letters  That popped up or something  Achiever letters  There was a song  Found him in the burnt out cabin  Two C's  With a fucking O and a K  And now people  Trying to back up B-Rock  There are rumors  That Lincoln was gay  And then this guy writes  Pull up Pierce  He looked gay  He's got the gay look  The gay face  The gay face  This is the thing with Lincoln 
[02:04:00]  Is that they have like  We all just fucking wank over  Daniel Day Lewis  Yeah  Right  Like he can't do anything wrong  But  They go  That's the best depiction  Of Lincoln  Ever  Fucking  Who knows that  Yeah  No one knows  Right  Sure  He's doing the depiction  Of the guy  At the fucking  Gettysburg museum  Who does the  Or the animatronic  Right  Right  In the hall of presidents  Four and seven years ago 
[02:04:30]  A machine did it  At Disney  Years before  Daniel Day  Lewis  He's doing that cunt  Right  But we don't know  In the same way  We don't know what dinosaurs sound like  Yeah  Right  We just assume  Because they're big fucking lizards  Right  They go  But we don't know  They probably didn't even make a sound  They might sound like sheep  Oh yeah  Or cats  Or  Yeah  Exactly  That might have been  Their fucking sound  That would look silly  And for all intents and purposes  Lincoln we just think  Sounds like  Because he was old looking  With a shitty beard  Yeah yeah 
[02:05:00]  And he might have sounded like  Annie Dick  Or anything  Well he had a high voice  Sound like a poof-to  Yeah  They finally figured out  His voice was a little higher  Than we thought  So  Yeah yeah  A lot of people pissed off  At E-Rock  We gotta go to Bonnie in D.C.  Really fast  Bonnie go ahead  Hey I just want E-Rock  To defend himself  Because everybody knows  Lincoln was gay  I just watched  A history channel program  Reading letters  That he wrote  About how he'd always  Loved this other dude  Well they spoke differently  In their letters back then 
[02:05:30]  Yeah  Ah  My dearest Bartholomew  Your ass cheeks  Are lovely  This time of year  I miss the smell  Of your taint  I'm gonna interpret that  We're balls  On a warm summer day  Anyone who can fuck  Sally Field  For that long  Where are these letters  Bonnie  Where are these letters  What letters  I'm telling you  I watched a history channel program  It wasn't even  Two weeks ago  And they were reading  The letters out loud  And they said  Alright let's find the letters 
[02:06:00]  I fear my orgasms  Have left me a cripple  The history channel  Has the bible now  Is history  Yeah  They're letting anything  Through the history channel  They're fucking  Like porn dealers  And storage wars  The history channels  Really dropped the ball  I know right  They used to all be Hitler  Just Hitler  They ran out of Hitler stuff  The Hitler channel  And then they just went  Ah fuck Hitler  Yeah  Let's go for warehouses  With stuff  And a guy bidding on us  I like the old days  Hitler and his Nazi menace  Sweeping across Europe 
[02:06:30]  They show him like  Tussling the hair  Of a young German boy  Yes  Now it's fucking  You know  How much can we rip you off  For a fucking baseball card  That's worth $20,000  Yes  Iraq  Are you gonna defend yourself  Or what  Baseball cards are old  So that's why it's history  Right  But the bible thing  Is I started watching the bible  On the plane coming over here  Yeah  Because I thought comedy purposes  Sure  I want the bible to start  With like just black  And then like  Oh you want the whole fucking 
[02:07:00]  I want a finger  It fucking leaps forward  To Noah's Ark  What?  In the first episode  It did huh?  And Noah just telling his family  About the beginning  Oh really?  It's like Noah's sitting on the boat  Going  And then he made the animals  And then he made some light  And here we are  So there's a lot of hearsay  Yeah  By this Noah guy  Second, third party  Fucking testimony  And it gets onto the history channel  And this one begat that one  And that one begat that one 
[02:07:30]  And begat, begat, begat  They always leave out those movies  Because I grew up watching  Cecil B. DeMille movies  Oh yeah  Ethics  But they always leave out the  It's like Abraham  The guy who went to the top of the mountain  And God said  You've got to kill your son  And then God was like  Kidding  You know that one?  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, but because you're going to kill your son  You're all right by me  And he's like  Oh God, cut it out  You're killing me  Why would you do that?  I was about to kill him  You fucking crazy bastard 
[02:08:00]  But he's like  You were going to do it  Weren't you?  Yeah, because I really love you  I really, really love you  I was going to kill my son  With no fucking issue  Yeah  And then the next bit of the Bible is  And then Abraham went home  And fucked his sister  And that bit's just never depicted in the movies  Where he had a celebratory fuck of his sister  Wow  Where he went  Oh, fuck my sister  It's like  I don't have to kill my kid  I'm going to fuck my sister  It's a natural respill  Right  It's  Yeah  Anybody would do that 
[02:08:30]  Wow, I never realized that  Well, we got two things  I might have made that up  Well, we got  We got two things  We got two things going on  Everyone wants to talk about Lincoln  They said he shared a bed with a young boy soldier for years  Boy toy  Do you have any info yet, Sam?  Yeah  Because E-Rock's not defending himself  In 19th century America  People need to understand  That men commonly bunked with other men  In the same bed?  Well, for example  When lawyers and judges traveled the circuit with Lincoln 
[02:09:00]  Uh-huh  The lawyers often slept two in a bed and eight in a room  Right  Don't judge  No, don't judge  William H. Herndon recalled  Why?  Why wouldn't you just take the floor at that point?  Was it that cold back then?  Oh, please  It's freezing cold  And then the rats on the floor  You gotta sleep with another man  You gotta put your dick in his ass, too  Keep it warm  Just to fucking forget the fact you're being eaten by bed bugs  Exactly  You're getting your ass fucked  You're going, ow, ow  And you forget that you're being chewed alive  They just freed the slaves for the extra space  Yeah 
[02:09:30]  There wasn't anything  They didn't like black people  It was just that they were taken up to a space in the bed  But who was the first guy that went, alright, this is fucked up  I'm not seeing you want to do it anymore  His name would have been Gary  Yeah  I don't know why  What else, Sam?  Well, a tabulation of historical sources shows  Historical horses  Lincoln slept in the same bed as at least 11 boys and men during his youth and adulthood  There are no known instances in which Lincoln tried to suppress knowledge or discussion of such arrangements 
[02:10:00]  And we vilify Michael Jackson  Uh-huh  He didn't do nothing  He was just Lincoln-esque  Oh, Lincoln fucking  Jesus Christ  Like, uh, Lincoln meant Joshua Fry's speed  I don't know if you guys know that  Yes  In 1837  They lived together for four years  Roomies  During which time they occupied the same bed during the night  They were the Bert and Ernie of the Civil War  Yes  I think it's just, um  Four years of sharing a bed with another dude 
[02:10:30]  They're roommates  Yeah, sure  In the same bed, no  Lincoln's big feet  Yeah  Just fucking getting all tangled with the other guys  He wore a size 17 shoe  The other guy would worship his feet  Oh, God  Because Lincoln had a  Lincoln had to sleep sideways  Because he was so fucking tall  So that doesn't give him a lot of room for the other dude  Well  That doesn't seem convenient at all  You know what you do with your girl  You kind of play footsie under the covers with her  And, you know  You play footsies with Lincoln's big hairy foot  Yeah  You know he had a big hairy foot 
[02:11:00]  Thinking playing what's under the stovepipe hat on his lap  Is it hard?  Is it soft?  What is it?  He would cut the top out of it like you do with a chick with a popcorn bucket  In the movies  And his roommate would reach in and just tug his cock  Has anyone officially  Can I enter your log cabin?  Yeah  Give him a fucking extra log  Do you think anyone has done the popcorn trick for real?  Yes  What's the popcorn trick?  I've fallen for it  It's where you cut the hole in the bottom of the popcorn  So when it girl reaches in, she grabs your cock  Oh, yes  Put your dick through it 
[02:11:30]  Do you think people actually did that?  Yeah  Someone had to  I think someone's done it  But it's the difficulty of keeping the erection  Right  Because me with a flaccid cock  I wouldn't even penetrate the fucking popcorn box  I think you'd have to pull your balls and dick through it  Yeah  Like really get it in there  Like the presentation  It's the going in, sitting down, getting yourself worked up  So you've got a stiffy  Yeah  Right  And then like she mightn't get to the end of the popcorn for a few minutes  And if you're watching a sci-fi movie  Very difficult to keep the erection that long 
[02:12:00]  That's what's so impressive about that trick  That is pretty  You know, you bring up a good point  But you've got to think  All that fucking greasy butter  That could feel pretty good  I don't know if butter and salt  Oh, the salt might sting  Yeah  And the kernels  The little pieces of kernels  Imagine one of those in your cock hole  Yeah  It would be fucking very unpleasant  It really doesn't sound like it works very well  No  No  Lincoln  I'd rather just reach over and grab her tit  Yeah, give her some juju beads  What's spelled the right way? 
[02:12:30]  What's wrong with old school rape?  Why do you have to dress it up?  You don't have to make it a trick  Yeah, that's silly  Sam Moore?  Yeah, Lincoln's bodyguard and companion  Captain David Derrickson  Between September 1862  Played by Sally Field in the movie  And April 1863  Yeah  The two of them would share a bed  When Lincoln's wife was gone  Sharing too many beds  You know, it's a warmth issue  It's very cold  Yeah 
[02:13:00]  Yeah  I'll tell you what though  I took a friend of mine on the road with me  For the last few gigs I did  And we shared a hotel room  If you haven't done it in a while  Like with the two beds  Uh-huh  Delightful  Really?  It's  You wake up  You know how you wake up next to a woman  And it's that  How's the day going?  Am I in trouble?  The first thing you ask a woman is  How are you?  Is everything okay?  Are we going to have a good time today? 
[02:13:30]  Is today a good day?  Or is today shit?  Am I in trouble today?  Have I slept weird?  Have you had a nightmare of me cheating on you?  Because if you've had a nightmare of me cheating on you  Then we're having a shitty fucking day  She's going to treat you like you did cheat on her  Yeah  Where you wake up next to a friend  It's like  We got fucked up last night  Now it's  You get more stories  And you have little stories  And then you go back to sleep  And then you fart  And you giggle at each other  It's fucking delightful  When you get up next to a friend  Delightful 
[02:14:00]  Wow  So you put your opener in the bed  I mean the same room  Oh I'd never do that  I  Me with my very best friend  Was coming out to stay  And we shared a room for like five nights  And ordinarily I'd never done it  And now I'm thinking of doing it with everyone  Right  Because I had such a good time  Sharing the toilet though  But he's getting you to smell his dump when you walk in  Oh it would drive me fucking nuts  Well that shit would drive you nuts Jimmy  I would literally  Even if it was my best friend  And the only option was share a room  Or sleep on the roof in the cold  That was the thing  With baseball players 
[02:14:30]  Or any sporting players  Up until about ten years ago  They always shared  Yeah  It was always  You always saw  Oh and he shares a room  They always talk about their roommate  Yeah  And now they don't do it  But it used to be with all sports  About ten years ago  They all shared a room  That's weird huh  I was watching that Ken Burns  Baseball documentary  Yawn  It's  But I'll tell you what  You fucking know everything  At the end of the thing  Yeah  It's 14 hours of  No why  Because you're panicking 
[02:15:00]  Thinking you're going to be quizzed on it  He can't fucking put together a documentary  Can't he  The bit that they play it like emotional  They play take me out to the ball game  Really slowly on the piano  And if it wasn't for the colour of his skin  He would have been the greatest player  That ever lived  Yes  Oh shit  And Ty Cobb had a drinking problem  And used to say the N word a lot  God damn 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  Ken Burns is good with putting that fucking music in  Because the Civil War documentary  He did that  Where it was like a lone fiddle playing  Right  You know  And it was the most American lives  That were ever lost in a battle  It's all sad  And it's a slow zoom out  Oh yeah  It shows one soldier  But by the end of it  And my god  A field of dead soldiers  It'll play America the Beautiful 
[02:16:00]  Very  Yeah  We lost more people in that war  Than we lost in any other war  Here's what you hear  And 18,000 people were killed  I thought he only did 
[02:16:30]  I thought he only did baseball documentaries  No that fucking Civil War one  Oh no he's all over the place now  And that one was done in real time  It's fucking  Wow was it  I'm saying it was long  It was great though  And to be able to put together a documentary  Where you don't have  Any fucking film  Yeah  Or video  This was all  Still pictures  And like paintings 
[02:17:00]  But he did that thing  That later would be called  The Ken Burns effect  Where he'd  He'd use a photograph  But be able to move it  In a certain way  With the camera  That it looked like action  You know it's like  Ah  There's the fort  And then they pan over  To the other side of the picture  Ah there's the boat  It's like oh I see  He made it like a 3D thing  Almost  Yeah then they would  They would like  Rotoscope out  A character  And then in  The post  They'd pull that  Forward from the background 
[02:17:30]  Blur the background  To give it like a depth of field  Yeah  And it looks  It really looks amazing  I like how  He just adds  To his documentaries  As he gets older  Like baseball  You can tell  Was all wrapped up  You think  Like he ended it with  And steroids  Right  Like he was all done  Yeah yeah  And then he came back  Well it doesn't seem to be  We haven't done this documentary  For six years  Steroids have gone away  The Boston Red Sox 
[02:18:00]  Dead win  Yeah he's got an update  He just adds on to it  Before he dies  Yeah he's  He's fucking  He's pretty good though  If you want to watch  A god damn long  Documentary on anything  You'll find yourself  Watching the whole damn thing  Yeah  Jeffries why are you in town brother  I'm doing the up fronts  For  Oh that's right  FX  We're doing  Is this the bowling  We're bowling  I remember you telling us  About bowling a couple weeks ago  Yeah we're coming out  I've never flown so far 
[02:18:30]  To fucking bowl in my life  And if anyone from FX  Is listening  Couldn't be happier about it  Can you bowl  Really  No I can't  I'm not  I'm not a great bowler  I  If I play a game  I'll get like two strikes  You know  I'm not embarrassingly bad  But  I  I use an ultra light ball  And  And sort of  Have a weird  Fred Flintstone  And walk up to the line  You know  Yeah  The tiptoe  It's not like  I'm thinking right now 
[02:19:00]  When I get there  I'm gonna bowl the shit  Out of this place  Everyone's gonna  Fucking know my name  I  I  I got off at the airport  Because there's all  The people  I imagine  Louis will be there  Is  Is  One of the other people  I'll know  Will he be bringing  His Peabody  I  He just  He just won a Peabody  Oh I thought  That was the guy  He slept with  In his log pocket  Oh right  We just wanna make sure  We you know  Congratulate Louis C.K.  On his Peabody  I have missed you 
[02:19:30]  Peabody  Yeah  It was Colonel Peabody  Which one is the Peabody  What award is that  It's a journalist award  It's a pretty prestigious award  Yeah of course  Of course  It probably means more  Than an Emmy or an Oscar  Yeah  We don't  We don't  Yeah  It's prestigious  Simon  Yeah  And Peabody  I think it's for  Time traveler  And I  I think Russell  Russell Brand will be there  I know Russell  But apart from that  I was on the fucking plane  With the  Charlie  Charlie from Sons of Anarchy  That's who I was sitting next to 
[02:20:00]  Oh cool  And I got off the plane  And you've never  Been less of a celebrity  When all the  Autograph hunters  Just fucking  Zoned in on him  And I just  Walked straight through  Oh man  And the thing was  I normally  I wouldn't  I don't want that attention  Or anything  But the executives  From FX  Were walking through  The airport with us  Oh no  You want them to see you  You can actually see  The pay difference  Between the two of us  Like where their money  Was going  Yeah  Like oh  The guy from  Sons of Anarchy  Yeah  He gets to go through  He's very British  That guy  Yeah 
[02:20:30]  Yeah  Very British  Well the thing is  You think  Because he's meant  To be a tough guy  Biker  But yeah  I always watch that show  Like  Are you tough  Are you  You know what I mean  Like it always seems  Like actors  Because all actors  Are fags  Right  It just seems like  Actors going  Don't fuck with me  And you know  They're all like  Fucking snapping  Their fingers  For a fucking latte  As soon as  The cut  You're tough 
[02:21:00]  Are you  Are you  Have you got  A painted on tattoo  You're a big boy  Now  That's a very good question  So the bowling  Goes down today  The bowling  Goes down today  And it's  We're meant to  We're meant to bowl  Against  The advertising people  Oh boy  Yawn  It must be a big day  For them though  They're like  Well  They're way more  Excited  Than you guys are  Yeah but imagine  The cunt  That has to bowl  Against my team 
[02:21:30]  Of DJ Qualls  And Dan Bacchardale  Like the ugliest people  On television  My show  Is the ugliest people  Ever to be  Fucking put on a screen  If  My  My TV show  Will never have a calendar  Right  They're never gonna be like  No  In February  We got a picture of Rodney  In his underwear  Just literally  Walking the beach  Nice  So they gotta bowl  Against us  And you know  The disappointment  If we get some  Like mid  40 year old women  Who are executives  Who wanna bowl 
[02:22:00]  With say  The guys from  The Americans  Or the fucking  Charlie from  Sons of Anarchy  And they get me  And DJ Qualls  Who looks like  An AIDS victim  Right  And Dan Bacchardale  Yeah  We're gonna have  The depressed group  That's a cool shot  Of course we're talking  About legit on FX  Yes  With our friend  Jim Jeffries  Wow  Yeah  The bowling thing  Australia  You didn't have  American bowling  Right  You had that  No that's the one thing  That the whole world agrees on  No  New England  They'd go with those 
[02:22:30]  Tiny little  Fucking softballs  Candle pin bowling  I thought the whole world  Nah  Except for New England  We all like  Can't pin bowling  Even like  There's people in  Burkis  Just fucking  Throwing a ball  Bowling  Yeah  Going  Ah it's good  Have you seen  Candlestick bowling  No  But we have  It's a nightmare  We have  My father  We tried it once  Up there in Boston  It's not fun at all  My father  Lawn bowls  Every day  Lawn bowling  What's lawn bowling  Lawn bowling is  Bachi ball  No no  It's a different thing  It's similar  But it involves  The ball curves 
[02:23:00]  It's on a flat bit of grass  Yeah  And you roll it  And the ball curves  And there's a jack  And then you gotta get the ball  It's the same as  Bachi is in the rules  As in you have to get it closer  But you do it from about  I don't know  50-60 metres away  And old people just  It's something you just  Start doing when you're old  You're like  Alright I'm lawn bowling now  Yeah  You know  And my dad just does it  Just so he doesn't have to  See my mum  You know what sucked  About candle pin bowling  I hate it  Like you take the ball 
[02:23:30]  And it's got no holes  In the ball  You just palm it  Get a video for Jim Jeffries  You palm it  And no matter how hard  You threw it  It would hit the pins  And go like  Cling cing cing  It would kind of bounce off  Like there's nothing better  Than when you throw  A fucking bowling ball  And you get a good fucking  And it curves  And hooks right in the pocket  And just  And it makes a great sound  Everything goes  The candle pin is just  Cling cing  Cling city cing  I tell you what  That bumper bowling though  Is making kids into tards  Oh yeah  You need gutters  Come on  Alright cause my  My fucking 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  My nephew's like  What is he  He's like  He's like 14  Yeah  I took him bowling  And him and his friends  And never been fucking  Without the bumpers up  You don't know what  A gutter ball is  And I said  You gotta put it down man  You look ridiculous  It's stupid  And then  And then the little fucker  His sister beat him  Cause she had the bumpers up  Cause she's an 11 year old girl  Like who gives a fuck  Let her have the bumpers up  Yeah  She beat him  Because you know  She's playing a sport  That doesn't matter  Right 
[02:24:30]  Yeah  And then he had a fucking cry  Oh shit  I've never been more disappointed  Cause his sister beat him  And I was like  Oh man  Look at this shit  Oh yeah  Look  See their little  Little candle  You must have seen those before  No I never seen  Listen to the sound  It looks like tablets  Yeah  Listen to the sound  Yeah  They look like old Tylenols  I don't know what the strategy is  Look at the tiny ball  He looks like Dennis Franz  Yeah  He does kind of look like  Look at that  That's the ball  He's one of those guys  That when you meet him  And someone goes  You know he's 30  He's from that generation 
[02:25:00]  Where everyone looked old  Yeah  Isn't it almost impossible  To get a strike  In candlestick bowling  I would  With that fucking little ball  Look at that thing  Do they do it in the US  Here we go  Yeah  New England  Oh New England  New England  Yeah  There's a strike right there  But man  That has  Is there places  So stupid  Or are people just doing it at home  New England is all about it  New England  Yeah  So you go to like  Actually like 
[02:25:30]  There'll be a bowling alley  With candle pin bowling  In it  Lucky strike  Candle pin bowling  Lucky strike  They have the regular bowling up there as well  But they certainly have  Held on to the candlestick too  Boy if you're not a pro bowler  Or you don't bowl very often  It's really a hit or miss kind of game  Isn't it  Like you could be like  Hey I bowled 210 that fucking round  And then you bow 80  And then the next round  It's like five gutter balls in a row  And you'll convince yourself  Like I think I got this now  Cause I don't guarantee  Your alley's gonna be perfectly fucking level 
[02:26:00]  That's true  That'll fuck up these guys  I don't think it's that  I just  I just try to bowl it  Straight and down the middle  There's no curve  No curving  No fucking  And you just  I can sort of see one  And then sometimes there's one  That one's too straight  Yeah yeah  Yeah that one's gonna leave  It's gonna leave a split  Yeah that one's too straight  Yeah  You want it just slightly off  Right  And then if I leave one  Slightly off  If I leave one ball  If I leave one pin in the corner  Oh that's a nightmare  For me that's  I could fucking miss it by miles 
[02:26:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  That's luck of the draw  That  All I've got is straight down the middle  Is my whole tactic  So if you  If you have one in the corner  If you have a 7 or a 10 pin still standing  Yeah  You have to bowl straight  Right next to the gutter  Exactly  And it has to go the whole way  Without going into the gutter  No you move all the way to the right  And do the angle thing  No but he  He just needs to go straight  It's not even the walk  It's not even the ball  I've got to stand in the other person's alley  That's what I'm saying  Yeah  Oh right right  And then bowling down  I can't  I can't like do that  No angles 
[02:27:00]  I can't visualize that  If I do it that way  Right  It'll go  No fucking chance  Have you ever been  Have you ever been like  Bowling with a girl  And she beats you  It's  It's demoralizing  Like I don't need  I don't need to beat women in sport  To feel good about myself  Right  But I do  Right  Yeah  And you bowl with a girl  And it's like  All right  There you go  I had this one chick from Kansas  Who bowled like a 200  And it just was the biggest turn off  I'd ever seen  You were done  I want a girl that just fucking  Just gutter balls it  And just goes 
[02:27:30]  Oh well  Whatever  I don't want her bowling strikes  I like a girl like you  You're right  One where the ball is heading  Toward the gutter  She's already turned around  And has her drink back in her hand  From the fucking table  She doesn't give a fuck  She's some dummy with long nails  Exactly  Some dummy  All right  Listen  We've got to take a break  Jim Jeffries is here  He's bowling  Anything else you want to promote?

[02:53:30]  What was it called?  Oh I don't know  By a very literal name  The Finding Device  It was  I was working for a company  Called Stratfield Car Radios  In Australia  And  And our slogan was  Drive in  And jive away  Right  Wow that's bad  That's fucking terrible  That is really fucking bad  They've gone  They've gone bust  Drive in  And it was like  Drive in  And jive away  A Stratfield Car  Radios to date  Drive in  And jive away 
[02:54:00]  That was the big fucking thing  Oh the big jingle  And it was me working with like  Italian and Greek guys  Who really gave a shit  About these fucking things  And I had like  A comedy career  That I wanted to  Get into  And it was just  The  I was just drunk  The whole time  You know like  That age  I was like 23  And just getting  Leathered  And waking up  And  Leathered  And just  I  I remember once  Selling a car stereo  To a bloke  Where it was like  I'd be 
[02:54:30]  I'd walk into people's cars  This guy had a white van  And I'd be like this  You can get some 6x9s there  You can put a subwoofer there  I didn't know what the fuck  I was talking about  Just babbling shit  Babbling shit  And we'll run the wires here  And I didn't know  What the fuck I was talking about  And so then  I pushed the job through  And I went to the guys  Who installed  And I got the apprentice guy  Who'd be there for like 2 weeks  Right  Oh man  And I said  Just put the fucking speakers there  Put them there  Run the wires here  Fucking Bob's your uncle  This will be fine  Right  So this young lad  Just fucking starts  Cutting into the vehicle  Oh shit 
[02:55:00]  And he puts  I told him  I told him  When he put the speakers  He gets the saw out  And goes  The fucking support beam  On this truck  No  He cuts through it  And the roof  The roof just starts caving in  No  So with one foul cut  We've totaled this gun's vehicle  Yes  Like totaled it  Right  Like totaled it  And the guy comes back  And this is my opening sentence  I go  Good news  Stereo sounds great 
[02:55:30]  Oh no  Bad news  You're going to have to  You're going to have to see your car  It was fucking  The roof was caved in  Fuck  Jesus  You just have to apologise  What a dummy  Did they just replace this truck  I think we had insurance  The company had insurance  For things such  We had another one  Where there was new BMWs  And you test all the wires  And no one had this  There was a  If you tapped one wire  The airbag went out  Oh shit  And no one knew this  About the new BMWs  Right  So this guy's gone 
[02:56:00]  And he's sitting in the fucking  The driver's seat  And he's pulled the stereo out  To put a new stereo in  And he's tapping all the wires  And then poof  Right  Knocked out cold  The fucker  Because he's on that angle  Where his head's down  And his thing  And so we just see  This cunt passed out  That white powder everywhere  Yeah  From the fucking airbag  The car was about  Five hours old  The guy bought it  And took it to get a new stereo  Oh man  And they're expensive to replace  No shit  Oh man 
[02:56:30]  But I was also working  In the days of fucking  Where we were talking about phones  Like this has a nine hour battery  So you only have to buy  Like four batteries  And  The good old days  And where you started  To tell people the weight  This is how much  This phone weighs  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Like because people  Were actually going  That is  And we went all the way  Down to little tiny phones  And now we're going  Fucking  Now we're going  The other way  The other way  Yeah  We can't figure it out  People want big fucking screens  Yeah  It was weird  At first 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  You would get a phone  And you were just amazed  That you had a phone  You could take with you  So it didn't matter  How much it weighed  The features that were on it  As long as you can make  A phone call  Yeah  Make a phone call  Sony had one that didn't have a screen  Yeah  I don't know how the fuck that worked  Like you just had to memorize numbers  And boop boop boop  Yeah yeah yeah  It was like a regular phone  I don't remember that one  But it had a remote control  Whoa  And like what fucking retard  Is  How's that  Why would you need a remote control  Or a phone
