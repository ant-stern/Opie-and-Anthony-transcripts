<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the MTV Movie Awards, which the hosts (Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Martini Steve) criticized as overproduced and lacking spontaneity. They commented on various aspects of the show, including Jimmy Fallon's hosting, Eminem's segment with Triumph the Insult Dog and Lindsay Lohan, and the Breakfast Club reunion.

A significant portion of the show focused on the hosts' "Assault on the Media" campaign and the resulting media backlash, particularly a Richard Huff column in the New York Daily News calling them "jerks."  Opie and Anthony detailed their strategy of disrupting live news broadcasts with strategically placed signs and other methods, gleefully recounting successful instances and emphasizing their goal of provoking a reaction and generating publicity.  They discussed listener responses and employed their usual offensive language throughout.  Tangential conversations included discussions of Mike Tyson, a planned execution in Oklahoma City, and listener calls offering further anecdotes.

The discussion of the Huff column continued, with the hosts defending their actions as a publicity stunt necessary to revive their careers after their firing from WNEW for the St. Patrick's Cathedral sex stunt.  They compared their actions to those of Howard Stern's fans, highlighting perceived media hypocrisy. The segment included numerous listener calls, with one caller, "Dragon Wagon," condemning the show as "disgusting" and "immoral," leading to a heated exchange.  The show also included a lengthy and graphic discussion of bowel movements, and the playing and discussion of listener-submitted jingles.  A significant portion was dedicated to negative reviews of the "Honeymooners" remake, contrasting them with Roger Ebert's positive review.

The show then shifted to a humorous anecdote about a "meat fist" delivered for a bad answer, followed by discussions of reckless NYC cab drivers and a caller's near-miss experience.  A review of Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedian" followed, focusing on Seinfeld's insecurities and the performance of Orny, described as "obnoxious" and "hateable." The hosts compared different comedic styles on late-night talk shows (Letterman, Leno, Conan).  A substantial portion dealt with MTV's "Hit Me Baby One More Time," with audio clips comparing original and live performances of songs by several aging bands. A caller challenged the hosts' comedic approach, specifically their jokes about dead children and HIV, prompting a heated exchange and a defense of their style as confronting taboo subjects.  The segment concluded with more "Hit Me Baby One More Time" audio clips, discussion of its success despite being a "train wreck," and listener-submitted remixes.  A brief, albeit apparently tense, interview with Richard Huff was also included.


The show further addressed the media criticism of their pranks, arguing that the media's outrage was hypocritical given journalism's own intrusive nature and entertainment-driven focus.  The discussion touched upon fact-checking and plagiarism, and again compared their actions to those of Howard Stern fans.  This segment included a phone call and in-studio appearance from Richard Huff, who defended some journalistic practices while acknowledging others were problematic. The conversation then veered to the NBC "Hit Me Baby One More Time" dance show and a lengthy, explicit discussion about Patty, a 50-year-old virgin fan's night out, including a male strip club.  The discussion also briefly touched on the disappearance of a woman in Aruba and other islands capitalizing on the negative publicity. A listener call and an in-studio appearance by Corrosion of Conformity (COC) concluded this section, including a mysterious, partially obscured celebrity phone call.


Finally, the show began with a discussion of an unflattering photograph, transitioning to a Vanilla Ice performance where he seemingly ad-libbed a lyric about the deceased Dimebag Darrell (audio played for verification).  The hosts shared anecdotes about their experiences in the music industry, including encounters with Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy Kilmister, and Ronnie James Dio. A humorous story about a bandmate stealing equipment after a Motorhead show was shared. The conversation became sexually explicit with a discussion of "pulling a train,"  followed by an update from guest Pepper about his yacht delivery job, which led to further sexually suggestive comments. The show concluded with promotion of their upcoming tour dates.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want the facts.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday. 
[00:04:30]  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  The slave drivers say no just for the hell to say a no.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  It feels so good to loosen up.  We're on it.  Get up, you daddy man show. 
[00:05:00]  Get up, you daddy man show.  Get up, you daddy man show.  Don't love me on me.  P.S. I am gay.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Hello, exactly.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Beyond AM, beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Don't fall for that old guy.  I am scared of you, sir, and I am protecting myself.  I don't want to ever see you again.  ONA party rock.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the news? 
[00:06:00]  Uh, no.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the news?  Wow, we got lots to do today, ladies and gentlemen.  Hi.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Jim Norton.  Hi, O.  Good morning, Martini Steve.  Good morning.  It's Martini Steve.  What a pleasure to have Martini Steve in studio, right off the bat.  Sitting down and everything.  What's he doing here?  Highlighting.  He's working his ass off.  Yes.  I am fucking tired. 
[00:06:30]  Are you sleepy?  What happened?  What happened?  I decided to watch the MTV Movie Awards so I could be up on pop culture.  I did the same thing.  It didn't end until 11.  So I could discuss it.  What time was it?  10?  Well, 10.30, then the after show, and then you finally crash, and by the time you fall asleep,  it's like 11.30-ish, I guess.  Yeah.  Then you get up at 5 in the morning, you know, it's not that bad, but it threw me off my routine, 
[00:07:00]  and I thought it would be worth it.  I thought we could come in here and discuss MTV and movies and the movie awards and all  the spectacular things that happened.  What a bore fest.  Really nothing.  It's the safest show you'll ever see now because it's recorded.  It's recorded in advance.  When did they tape that?  Well, that's a problem.  Well, they taped it over a week ago, maybe two weeks ago, and all the stuff was already  in the paper, so there were no surprises.  No surprises. 
[00:07:30]  They edit out anything that anyone would do that might be offensive, so there's no spontaneity  there.  Then, you know what I noticed they also do?  They're over-producing these things where they're using visual effects now.  You know, it takes the whole live, like even if they're not live, at least fake it, where  I'm thinking I might get a surprise.  But if you have a Mariah Carey segment that's done with, you know, an artsy black and white  with her coming out and she's the only one in color. 
[00:08:00]  You know some idiot in post is sitting there for, you know, a week just tooling that.  You know that there's going to be no surprises.  It just stunk and it was boring.  It was really boring.  You know, you just watch it now for maybe a glance at some hot chicks or something like  that.  And now they'll run it about a hundred times.  Yeah.  Over the weekend.  I don't know.  Did you see, what's her name?  She's so fucking hot.  There were a lot of hot.  That was hot.  What's her name?  Young actresses.  God.  Oh, Dakota Fanning. 
[00:08:30]  I had to say that.  Sick.  That kid creeps me out.  Yeah.  She talks.  She talks like she's 25 years old.  Like an adult.  And it's frightening.  It really is frightening.  Tom Cruise carrying her around on stage.  That was a little creepy.  Of course, the joke.  She's going to be dating her next week.  Yeah, sure he is.  Sure he is.  But, you know, I don't even know if there's anything worth talking about as far as the 
[00:09:00]  MTV Movie Awards go.  I guess we could talk about the reunion of the Breakfast Club gang.  Oh, with the teacher coming out and not knowing where he was.  Hey, oh, hi, Molly.  You hear that?  Hi, Molly.  Gives her a hug.  Hi, Allie.  He was the tough guy.  You know?  You kids.  Yeah.  Time just stinks.  What did he say?  You mess with the bull, you get the horns? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he's like, Hi, Molly.  Comes out with a big popcorn statue.  He can barely hold it.  What happened to that guy?  He was the tough guy.  I'm going to cross the street now.  I got the award for you guys.  Hey, for the movie we did 20 years ago.  Oh.  I'm going to get on stage now.  Oh, good God.  And what were they trying to prove?  I don't know. 
[00:10:00]  I didn't get it.  There was a good movie that was out 20 years ago.  What's the big deal?  Well, kids could still relate because there was a geek.  Like, a little rich spoiled girl.  It was a good movie to sit and watch.  But as far as doing some 20-year little tribute to it, I don't know.  And Emilio Estevez and that other guy, Judd, or whatever.  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson.  They decide not to be any part of that. 
[00:10:30]  Shut up.  Ali Sheedy is completely insane.  She has been for years.  You read little stories about her, drug problems, and just being generally crazy.  And she proved that again.  She's one of those that, like, I don't know.  She was getting a little too chummy with her ex-castmates who, you know,  haven't spoken to each other since the movie was made.  She's just kind of kooky.  It was just a train wreck of a show.  Yeah.  Nothing really happened, though. 
[00:11:00]  Nothing exciting.  Jimmy Fallon was the host.  He was shaken during the whole thing, which was a little weird.  And then he did a little skit with Sandra Bullock that was, like, mildly entertaining.  That was pretty good.  Grabbed her tits.  Well, the beginning, it had potential because the beginning was funny with the whole Batman thing.  Yeah.  Where Jimmy Fallon's in the Bat-car with Batman.  He did that with a bunch of the movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Star Wars.  Trying to get to the MTV Movie Awards and all that.  And then Batman pulls off his mask and it's Napoleon Dynamite. 
[00:11:30]  That was pretty funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Gosh.  He's a weird dude, man.  He's...  I can't picture him as anyone but Napoleon Dynamite.  So when he comes out and talks normal...  He was just a college kid and his friend was making the movie, I guess, right?  And said, hey, I got a part for my little college film I'm doing or something like that.  And now he's married and stuff?  That's what I want to bring up.  All of a sudden, he won an award and he gets up there and thanks his wife. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Marriage ain't gonna last.  No, he's like...  What is he?  Is he Mormon or something?  Oh, he's one of those guys?  He's something that, like, you know, they don't drink or smoke and, you know, don't get divorced.  Things like that.  When he thanked his wife, though.  Oof.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Because he can't be more than, what, 22, 23?  Sure.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I guess there's nothing really there.  No.  Tracks one through five, Jimmy Fallon's monologue. 
[00:12:30]  Track six, Eminem doing Triumph.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was Eminem doing Triumph?  Yeah, because they were playing off the fact that Triumph, the insult dog, really pissed off  Eminem at one of those other award shows.  So now Eminem was doing it to Lindsay Lohan and then threw the puppet down on the ground  when he was done.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  I didn't get it.  Here's Jimmy Fallon from last night.  Welcome to the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.  Wow! 
[00:13:00]  Great to be here in L.A. hosting the Movie Awards.  Though I'm not pleased with my accommodations, MTV put me up at the Hotel Rwanda.  Not fun.  Not fun.  I don't get it.  Why would he be at the Hotel Rwanda?  Huh?  Why would he be at the Hotel Rwanda?  Maybe it was the Source Awards.  Well, he's got to tie in all the movies, you know. 
[00:13:30]  Don't do that.  Jimmy goes to give me the paper towels and puts it by his zippers like I have to grab  his big fat paper towel like cock.  What is it going to take to get the food here early?  I know.  We talked about this like a week, week and a half ago.  And now we're eating again.  It's really distracting when you're trying to do a radio show.  It really is.  As everyone digs into their goodness in front of them.  And you can't wait because there's no real waiting.  What, am I going to wait an hour until we take a break?  Well, you can't, yeah, you can't, because then we only break for two minutes or whatever.  So we have to eat.  Let's say hi to Nick in D.C. 
[00:14:00]  Nick, what's up?  Hey, good morning, Ope.  Good morning, Ann.  Good morning.  Hello, Nick.  Hi.  Opie, I just wanted to let you know, man, it's not even worth watching anything on MTV  anymore.  Not even the award shows.  I gave up on that shit a long time ago just because of the fake stuff like that.  You know what I mean, man?  It's not about you, man.  It's about the kids, man.  You just outgrew MTV.  Nah, it's not even about that anymore.  MTV used to be a lot of fun.  These award shows used to goof on all the other award shows.  They were live. 
[00:14:30]  You didn't know what was going to happen.  Yeah.  And now it's become everything they pretty much hated in the beginning.  No surprises whatsoever.  No surprises whatsoever.  Obviously, you can't offend anyone, even on MTV.  No, play it safe.  Which is a shame.  You would think at least MTV would hold out and still be politically incorrect and really  have some fun.  But no, God forbid.  God forbid we make fun of anyone out there.  Shake things up a little bit.  I'm punching out, guys.  All right.  I'm sure the show will get huge ratings because, you know, there's a bunch of just robots that 
[00:15:00]  will tune it in no matter what.  But they're not satisfied by the entertainment.  We did.  Yeah, well, we did because we do a radio show and we're thinking, well, we should talk about  this.  Yeah.  It's big as far as pop culture goes.  Here's more Jimmy Fallon.  Big summer movies are out.  Star Wars Episode 3.  On the first midnight show and they made $16.5 million. 
[00:15:30]  That night, so many nerds left the house that the Internet stopped.  Another big hit, the Pacifier made $110 million.  Why, by the way?  $110 million.  That means 10 million people said, hmm, Vin Diesel and a duck?  Yes, please.  Here's my $10.  Maybe he should have put a duck in taxi.  I don't know.  Anyone else notice the Mitch Hedberg delivery there, by the way? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's ripping them off.  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them, Fred.  Anytime I see anything close to a rip-off or someone copying something, whether I'm on  the show or not, I'll be home and see something.  I saw something last night.  Yeah.  I was like, wow, that sure is familiar.  Yeah.  I've seen that before.  Tell them, Fred.  I just can't stop doing it.  The best part of that clip is Fred doesn't say anything back.  Fred doesn't say anything because he's just sitting there like, shut up. 
[00:16:30]  Put up with your shit for 20 years.  Because I've had it.  I'm not telling anybody anything anymore.  Right.  Tell them, Fred.  No.  Tell them, Fred.  I won't tell them.  I won't tell them, Howard.  Oh, classic.  All right.  More Fallon.  Christian Slater was arrested for grabbing a woman's ass on the New York Street.  I guess his old pickup line doesn't work like it used to.  Greetings and salutations.  How'd you like to get your ass pinched by the guy from Young Guns 2? 
[00:17:00]  That's brutal.  What do you think so far?  It's a monologue, all right.  Did you trash the Honeymooners at all?  Of course not.  No.  Papers are killing the Honeymooners today, and I couldn't be happier.  I've been obsessed with this movie ever since I heard they were doing it.  Yep.  And now we're getting just horrendous reviews coming in.  Napoleon Dynamite Kid is 27 years old.  Oh, wow.  He's 27. 
[00:17:30]  But I thought it was a college film.  Well, I guess his friend was in college or something?  Yeah, probably.  Oh, okay.  He looks a lot younger than 27.  Sorry about that.  Any mentions of how all these black actors are just redoing white roles?  Not that that's bad, but just that there's something funny there.  I wonder if there's any mentions of that on MTV.  No.  There are a lot of movies coming out that are inspired by old TV shows.  Oh, okay.  The Wish, the Honeymooners.  And next year, Paris Hilton will star in Leave it to Beaver.  It should be really good. 
[00:18:00]  That's a plushy joke.  Fantastic film.  It's going to be a good year for Paris.  She got engaged to a guy named Paris Latsis.  The two are very sold the movie rights to this story.  It's called Herpes Fully Loaded.  Good name, good title.  All right, that's a little funny.  A little brutal.  I might say that Paris loves herself, but she's marrying a flat-chested, bleached blonde rich  kid named Paris.  That would be like if I married a tall, skinny, goofy girl with bushy eyebrows named Jimma. 
[00:18:30]  You mean my girlfriend Jimma?  That guy had nothing, by the way.  You could tell he was so uncomfortable by the end of that joke.  Is that when he started shaking through the whole broadcast?  I think Pringles was just a laid-back company.  Yeah.  That really is a headberg.  You hear the headberg in his delivery, right?  I don't know.  They had Chris Rock and Adam Sandler get up there and just read off a telepropt. 
[00:19:00]  Telepropt?  Propter?  Teleprops are always a...  Teleproptor?  Hey, can somebody find out where my yogurt is?  There's a man looking for some yogurt.  I don't understand...  It's a telepropeller.  I don't understand, though, you know, you get these funny guys, just have them go up  there and just riff.  Dude, that would be spontaneous.  They might say something that might offend somebody.  It's all got to be run through a screener and people that have no sense of humor whatsoever  to make sure it's not offensive. 
[00:19:30]  That's it.  You can't have Chris Rock out on a stage riffing.  You're insane.  We'll be fined.  Advertisers will pull out.  What of the children?  It's just a mess.  Television.  MTV.  They were supposed to be the Rebels years ago.  What happened?  Chris Rock, he had two huge movies out right now.  Chris Rock has two huge movies out right now.  He was an inmate in the Longest Yard and the voice of a zebra in Madagascar. 
[00:20:00]  Rock said, America likes to see a black man in two ways.  In jail or in a zoo?  As long as he's behind bars.  That's kind of funny.  Yep.  He had to do it in the Chris Rock voice, though.  You've got to do it in character.  Yeah.  Character.  That was a little taste of Jimmy Fallon last night.  Mmm.  And then, uh...  Tastes like French toast.  Huh?  How's the French toast?  Very good.  Hurry up and eat, because I've got an egg sandwich waiting and ready to go over here. 
[00:20:30]  This banana is really good.  You guys are killing me.  I know.  It's awful.  Yeah, we can't all three eat at once.  No.  Not all three of them.  All right.  Uh...  Here's Eminem doing Triumph the Insult Dog.  Right?  Lindsay Lohan.  How beautiful.  I've seen all of your movies, you know.  I love them so much, I'm going to see them again.  Only this time, I won't fall asleep during them. 
[00:21:00]  No, I joke, I joke.  Seriously, though.  You like remaking movies.  First, Freaky Friday.  Then, Herbie Love Bug.  What are you going to remake next?  Glitter?  I kid, I kid.  Really, really.  When are we going to make a movie together?  No.  I'll set up the tripod and make sure the night vision is on. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, baby, yes.  Oh, baby.  Why is he doing the Cookie Monster?  I don't know.  And then they show it's Eminem doing it.  Right.  The place went nuts.  Woo!  And then he went and did his latest song for everybody.  Ooh.  So, great.  Ooh.  Oh.  I don't know, that's about all we have on the MTV Movie Awards.  That was worth staying up late.  That sounds like fun.  Maybe something else.  That was worth getting no sleep over and coming in here exhausted for, right? 
[00:22:00]  Really pissed me off.  Yeah, that was the worst one yet.  As far as the MTV, any of their award shows go.  At least with any of the other ones, there's been one little thing you could take away from it and go,  Hey, did you see last night when whoever did whatever?  It was just nothing.  Devoid of entertainment.  Yeah, even the, I don't know, the bands and the performances.  The performances, I guess.  Dare I say lackluster.  Oh, my God, they were. 
[00:22:30]  Although the only really kind of cool thing was the Breakfast Club tribute thing they did.  Who was the band that did the song?  Yellow Car.  Yellow Car?  Yeah, Yellow Car did.  They did a pretty good version of that.  Simple Minds, don't you forget about me.  Wasn't bad.  Not bad at all.  All right.  Well, if you have anything else on the MTV Movie Awards that we're forgetting, definitely give the show a call today.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's great.  It just got passed out something, I guess, that it's Walmart.com. 
[00:23:00]  This is off of Walmart.com where you can buy XM satellite radio.  Okay.  And they tell you a little bit about XM.  Right.  Learn more.  Learn more.  On the Walmart.com website.  So you can be well informed before you decide.  Right, make a decision.  Which satellite service you're going to get.  XM Learn More subscription, $12.95 per month.

[00:23:30]  Official satellite radio partner of Major League Baseball.  Special interest programming featuring personalities like, and here we go, Bob Edwards, Snoop Dogg, and Opie and Andy.  Oh, these fucking assholes.  How great would it be if, like, 300,000 Walmart rubes bought us.  Oh, that's true.  Well.  Old-time entertainment.  I'm going to want to hear that.  That sounds like some family entertainment. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Have Barney Fife come on.  Opie and Andy.  Opie and Andy.  You know, when we first hooked up to do radio, I thought Anthony was a little too close to Andy, and people would mistake it.  And they have over the years.  And Walmart.com is the latest person, uh, person, latest, uh, entity to make that mistake.  My favorite, uh, mispronunciation of, uh, the show name is Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Opie and Anthony.  I was listening to Opie and Anthony.  By the way, it's Yellow Card.  I'm sorry.  Not Yellow Car.  Card?  Yeah.  Yellow Card.  Okay.  I misspoke.  Well.  Uh, really fast.  Here's Family Guy making fun of, uh, Jimmy Fallon.  Hey!  Hey, everybody.  It's, uh, great to be back.  So, we got a great show tonight, and, uh...  Hey, Fallon!  Say goodnight, ya bum!  And this is for laughing and looking at the camera during every sketch you've ever been in. 
[00:25:00]  What do you think you're, uh, Carol Burnett?  You think because she did it, it's okay for you?  You haven't earned what she's earned, buddy.  All right, now, where's the guy who slept with my daughter?  Here we go.  A little shot at Jimmy Fallon.  Done on Family Guy.  Very good.  Are you liking them yet, or no?  The newer version?  I gave up on Family Guy already.  Whoa!  I just completely gave up on it.  Wow.  And a lot of people have emailed me and said, uh, I was sort of right that, uh, the quality  has gone down since the first episode.  Gave up on it? 
[00:25:30]  How many episodes did you give them?  I, uh, watched the first...  One.  No, I watched the first three.  Yeah.  Never got better?  I don't think so.  I think they're, you know, it's all about American Dad.  I think they want that show to really succeed now.  Wow.  I really do.  And they're using the, uh, Successive Family Guy to propel American Dad.  That's a shame.  You don't hear a real buzz on the new Family Guy, uh...  No.  Not like when it was on, uh, first time around. 
[00:26:00]  That's for sure.  All right, we gotta get into some other things here.  Are you done eating for now, Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, for now.  I'm done.  Because then...  You can continue.  That was pretty much filler.  We gotta get to the real story.  Someone is in a huff today.  Ooh.  Somebody is in a huff.  A huff.  And what's his name?  Richard Huff.  Richard Huff is in a huff.  Richard Huff.  Wait a minute.  That's wacky.  Gotta start by saying another guy playing right into our hands.  We probably shouldn't tell people this, but... 
[00:26:30]  Mwahaha.  These people play into our hands perfectly.  This is exactly what we're looking for.  We're not afraid to say.  We're attention whores.  We understand what it's going to take to make this show successful.  And, uh, it's attention.  And this is getting attention.  It's working.  This is how it started.  This is how it started, by the way.  Uh, we got to XM.  We had a lot of confidence in the marketing department.  We figured, okay, these guys are going to market the shit out of the Opie and Anthony  show. 
[00:27:00]  They did a, uh, lackluster job at best.  That's what we thought.  Sure.  So we decided, alright, well, we're not going to sit around and wait for them to get our  names out there.  We'll have to do it ourselves once again.  Right.  Just like we did in the old days at, uh, WNAW.  So we started this assault on the media, Anthony.  And, uh, today, Richard Huff played right into our...  Well, I just want to make sure, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  Perfect.  Thank you. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you.  It's all you need.  You can call us jerks.  You can call us whatever you want.  As long as I see Opie and Anthony at XM Satellite Radio, I'm happy.  And you know something?  When you see Opie and Anthony in a news story, you know the headline is going to contain,  uh, a word or two that we're familiar with from other stories.  What is the word in this headline?  Jerks.  Jerks.  Very good.  It's never...  It's never something good.  It's always jerks, idiots, buffoons. 
[00:28:00]  We've seen it all.  Toxic twins.  Toxic twins.  Opie and dopey.  Opie and dopey.  A good one.  Morons is always a good one.  Morons.  This one, jerks.  Guy playing right into our hands.  I gotta tell you guys, the exposure is unbelievable.  It's a full page article on our Assault on the Media in a section of the paper that pretty  much everyone goes to.  You know, you get your newspaper, you're not going to make it all the way to the business  section for the most part.  You're not going to make it to the comics.  You're going to fly through the headlines first, then you go to the back. 
[00:28:30]  Go to the back, check out sports, check out TV talk, what have you.  The gossip.  The gossip page is always good.  I would have to say this is probably one of the most read pages in the paper every day.  Mm-hmm.  Tube talk, it's called, Anthony.  It's black and white and red all over, Opie.  Ha ha.  Richard.  It's a newspaper.  Richard Huff.  Jimmy.  Of course, he had to do a whole article on our Assault on the Media, Anthony.  Assault on the Media.  It's working.  Which is only going to make the pests work harder. 
[00:29:00]  Look, pests, you've made the news.  Very good.  Pests.  Yeah, because now the pests see this and go, oh my God, look.  Look at the attention these people got.  I'm going to do it more.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Pests.  Trying to get them to get away from your head.  They're flying your ear at night.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  Bzz.  This is only going to make it go to the next level. 
[00:29:30]  Love it.  And Richard Hubbs understands that.  He mentions that in this article.  He can't help himself.  He knows this is only going to make it worse.  Of course.  But he is so enraged, Anthony.  He has to write about it.  Him and his fellow journalists, all of his colleagues, are very upset by this assault on the media.  Yeah, we gave him something to write about.  I'm sure it was a slow week, and he's like,  I'm getting a paycheck, I've got to write about something.  I guess I'll have to write about those dopes, Opie and Anthony, and their assault on the media. 
[00:30:00]  Well, you know something?  Also, this is going on, a lot of talk about this is going on behind the scenes at the news organizations.  Yeah.  They're having meetings about this.  They're having meetings on how to combat it and what to do if it happens to you.  We hear from these people that work there.  This is a big thing now, and they're getting petrified.  And we'll just keep it going.  There's nothing really they can do about it.  If they're going to put a reporter out on the street somewhere and roll a camera in front of them and go live, 
[00:30:30]  that whole background, unless they're going to start doing tight close-ups on their face,  just their face, nothing else, which they're not going to do, we're going to keep doing it.  Well, that's where we start putting the signs in front of their faces.  That's our goal, to get them to just do a close-up on their lips.  Hello, the story today, here from the subway station.  This is our campaign of fear, you douchebags.  That's right. 
[00:31:00]  Our campaign of fear.  We're a little, you know, we're a little annoyed at the press.  Who isn't?  They just scare the shit out of you every night.  They scare you.  What's in your swimming pool that could kill you at 11?  What?  At 11?  My kids are in the pool right now, you fuck.  I'm going to take a dip.  Right.  What am I dipping in?  Why do I have to wait for 11 o'clock so you can make some money?  We'll tell you which car is being recalled for faulty brakes.  That could kill you.  Is it your car? 
[00:31:30]  Find out at 11.  But I'm driving.  I've got to go pick up the kids right now.  The kids are, they're at practice and they're at the soccer field.  My brakes are, I can't just leave them there.  Spin the wheel of death.  Take that drive before 11.  What?  That's their campaign of fear.  Here's our campaign of fear right back at you.  Will we turn up behind you?  Will you be able to keep your composure?  Or will you say fuck and lose your job?  That's the game we play now. 
[00:32:00]  That's what we play.  That's our campaign of fear.  You know what's interesting too?  You guys are jerks and there's an article on this.  Jerks, it says it right there.  The scumbag, Jason Blair.  Disgraced former New York Times reporter Jason Blair.  The guy that made up stuff, right?  That's how he is addressed and you guys are jerks.  And this scumbag was lying and he was never talked about like this jerk or this scumbag or this liar.  Why was he never addressed in the press?  You incestuous pigs.  Because they all do that. 
[00:32:30]  And God help the reporter that actually jumped on him and ripped him apart because, you know, glass houses.  And they reported on him.  I mean, they didn't hide it.  They did report it.  But why didn't they attack it the same way they attacked that?  You know what I mean?  He's not a jerk.  Mr. Bin Laden, Mr. Zarqawi, you know, Mr. Blair.  Jerks.  Opie and Dopey.  Jerks.  These cowards.  It's amazing where they won't take shots.  Right.  Well, let me describe this.  So it's the New York Daily News.  It's tube talk. 
[00:33:00]  It's a huge page in the paper like we said.  Is it really any bigger than any of the other pages in the paper, Opie?  Oh, you mean figuratively.  I thought you meant it was a huge page.  I'm looking for this big newspaper page.  Well, I guess to explain further, it pretty much takes up the entire page.  Right.  A lot of times you have a page in the paper, but you're just part of the page.  This is pretty much the whole page.  Nice.  And there's a couple pictures.  There's Pat Battle reporting about the shark attack. 
[00:33:30]  Pat Battleaxe.  With one of our pests.  She should have been reporting how her hair looks like Christian Slater while he was arrested.  55-year-old black woman, would you fix that?  It's awful.  There she is at the beach in her reporting suit trying to do a serious report on a shark attack.  And there's one of our pests in the background smiling with no shirt on with an Opie Anthony XM sign.  And he made the paper now.  Yeah, it's right there.  Immortalized in the daily news. 
[00:34:00]  It's right there, man.  Make sure you get it up on the website for this fine fan.  And then above that is the one that was done, what, earlier this week?  Yes.  And with the huge Opie and Anthony cartoon sign that you've seen a bunch of times.  With, what's her name again?  I forgot her name.  Oh.  Ziggy's friend there, who works with Ziggy.  Rosalyn, that's right.  Rosalyn, you can see her nose and her ears above the sign.  Top of her face peeking over.  Top of her face peeking over as this reporter is trying to do a serious report on rape.  On a rape. 
[00:34:30]  And somebody was very upset that we would actually use a story about rape.  Tough shit.  To publicize our show.  Like we pick and choose what stories.  Absolutely.  And someone actually said, it was a crime scene.  It says it in that article.  I'm sure you'll read it.  Yeah.  But it says it in there.  It was a crime scene.  And they put, no it wasn't.  It's the top of the stairs to a subway, which downstairs in some dark friggin' doorway was  the crime scene.  Stop it.  And if it is a crime scene, why are you trampling it all over with your reporter feet? 
[00:35:00]  Your stupid reporter feet.  Right.  Stay out of the crime scene, stupid.  Yeah, because you're more important.  Camera guy is dragging his dirty work boots.  Yeah.  All over DNA evidence.  I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure the cops want you in a crime scene.  Yeah.  You idiots.  It's amazing.  They don't really consider the consequences when they're reporting on a Koran being ripped  up.  No one gives a shit about the consequences of that.  Right.  But God forbid, you know, you should think of the consequences when you're holding up  a sign behind some self-important asshole.  You know what really upsets them? 
[00:35:30]  Really upsets them?  Unlike the St. Pat's thing, that they could all jump on board and get us fired about.  There's really nothing they can do about this except be really pissed off because there's  nothing wrong going on here.  There's nothing they can do.  We finally, I think we've gotten smarter as broadcasters.  We finally figured out a way to be just extreme pests, get our names out there, and there's  nothing, like you said, they can do about it.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  This isn't illegal. 
[00:36:00]  There's nothing that can stop them.  It's all fair, fair territory behind those reporters.  Hell, man.  All these people, I'm sure even Richard Huff wrote about us when we got fired, they all  had their fun.  They all had their fun with the whole St. Pat's sex in a church thing.  They didn't care if they got their facts right.  They just needed to jump on the story and attack.  Make the story better by punching it up a little bit.  Well, now this is how we have fun.  It's how we have a little fun with you back.  Just have a little fun.  Right back at you.  Just have a little fun. 
[00:36:30]  You guys had fun with us.  We're having fun back.  Having fun.  That's all.  Do your live shots.  Guys, there's an army of dopes out there.  Moronic pests that will turn up in your camera shot.  Just like the Iraqi army, they don't even have uniforms.  No.  Some of them are clothed in Opie and Anthony wear.  Some of them are almost naked.  Right.  Like that little fella down there.  They're wearing a mask holding Arthur Sheehan's head.  Holy crap. 
[00:37:00]  Saying some kind of awful babble.  Of course.  Oh, and a party rock.  Party rock.  You don't think about consequences when you report on anything.  You never think about consequences.  But when it affects you or one of your own, all of a sudden, how do you not think of the consequences?  Oh, this is horrible.  You shitheads.  Why don't we get Richard Huff on the phone today?  He wouldn't get on the phone.  Where's Richard Huff?  They'll never get on the phone.  Why don't we get good old Richard Huff?  We'll give him a statement. 
[00:37:30]  Dick, if I will.  Why didn't old Dick Huff, Dick Huff, Dick Breath, actually, because a Huff is a deep breath.  A Huff.  Why didn't old Dick Breath give us a call and get our whole take on the whole thing?  Why not?  Because that would be real honest in journalism.  Why would you?  Why would you?  Just do what Jason Blair did.  Just steal some shit with AP at the end of it and write your name.  Well, guys, this is definitely worth reading, so let me begin this, okay?  The headline, of course, jerks playing interference on live shots. 
[00:38:00]  There's a saying in TV circles that the camera is a $50,000 idiot magnet.  I've never heard that in my life.  Yeah, that must be something the cameramen say.  The type of circle he stands in has a cracker in the middle of it.  What kind of boring part is he going to?  That's what they talk about.  Not, look at her tits.  You know that camera?  A $50,000 idiot magnet.  Idiot magnet right there.  Good point, Richard.  Good point.  Viewers got to see just what an idiot draw a TV camera is a couple of times this week when, 
[00:38:30]  oh boy, uh, uh, psychophants?  Yeah.  Psychophant.  That's right.  Huh?  Psychophant.  I know.  Psychophants of Radio Jock's Opie and Anthony turned up in the background of live news shots,  Anthony.  The incident's part of a dis...  Uh, of a dis...  Oh my God, I can't talk because I haven't eaten yet.  I'm shaking.  All right, the incident's part of a disruption campaign launched by the XM radio host has 
[00:39:00]  forced local news producers to end live shots early and take other precautions to keep the  knuckleheads off the air.  Which they have.  For example, Tuesday at noon, WABC Channel 7's Marcus Solis was ambushed while reporting  on the rape of a woman in Hunters Point, Queens.  My God.  Oh.  He was ambushed.  He certainly was.  Not.  Uh, as Solis delivered his live introduction, a man and woman ran behind him carrying an O&A 
[00:39:30]  sign while shouting their names.  But rather than deal with the jerks, Channel 7 never went back to Solis after his report.  Uh, yeah, it is kind of odd.  They go to these reporters now, um, the reporter does his little thing, they go to the tape  segment, and then it always ends with them going back to the reporter who gives his little  take on the segment, and then says, back to you in the studio.  And then they go, thank you, and continue the news.  Uh, whenever there's an assault, they cut it off very quickly now, after the Arthur Chien 
[00:40:00]  thing.  They cut it off, like, right after he's done with his last word, they go right to tape,  and never go back to the reporter again.  And I love it.  It screws up their newscast, probably screws up their rhythm.  Uh, the anchors now have to handle, uh, tying the story up.  It's wonderful.  Every time they're doing a live shot, they have to be worried that some mokes with a  cartoon sign is going to run behind it and spoil the whole thing.  Asinine cartoon.  You know what's funny about that? 
[00:40:30]  We were watching all the news channels this morning, because, you know, that's what we  do in the office, to try to get prepared for this radio program.  And every time they went live, I was getting a weird feeling, like, oh, God, is it going  to, are they striking behind this particular reporter, right?  All right, so, uh, they never went back to Solace after his report.  When will this distraction campaign stop, asked the reader Charles James.  A rape scene, an active crime scene, Solace was doing his best to inform viewers of the 
[00:41:00]  heinous crime that took place.  How insensitive and inconsiderate of the Opie and Anthony camp.  Ooh.  By the way, we don't care if he leaves the XM sticker on her mouth.  We could care less what the crime scene is, stupid.  We're here to get attention.  And by the way, I love the way he quotes a reader.  Yeah.  Quoting reader Charles, that's news, you asshole, you balding asshole.  You quote reader Charles James.  What reader?  Exactly.  A reader of what?  Of what? 
[00:41:30]  What was he reading?  He could have been rifling through the newest kiddie porn magazine.  And I'd certainly respect that.  That's who you quote.  I bet you he found one lousy email in his inbox about this.  And this is what the news does.  Now they blow it out of proportion.  Like, because this guy was offended, everyone else must have been.  Right.  He didn't get much email on this, I guarantee it.  Oh, no one cares.  Charles James is a douche.  And WNBC Channel 4's Pat Battle also had an ONA disciple dissent on her live report on a... 
[00:42:00]  Is she awful?  She is horrible.  That awful pantsuit battle.  She's been around forever.  Forever.  Well, by the way, these videos are up on opanthony.com, because now these videos are very famous.  They made the newspaper.  And WNBC's Channel 4's Pat Battle also had an ONA disciple dissent on her live report on a shark attack from the Jersey Shore, Anthony.  We prepare our staffers, our journalists, to handle these types of situations professionally, said a Channel 4 spokeswoman. 
[00:42:30]  Not like Channel 2.  We have procedures in place to protect the integrity of our broadcasts, a Channel 2 spokeswoman said.  Our news department is comprised of veteran reporters who should know how to handle these situations.  He only goes to them.  You're right.  No calls to you guys.  What is it you're trying to accomplish?  Why don't you stop doing it?  Not one call to you guys, only to the...  The one-sided story.  Of course it is. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  They tried to talk to Wayne Williams when he was accused of murdering children in Atlanta.  They camped outside to get his opinion.  To get his opinion, because maybe a couple of people might read and go,  All right, I see his point.  But I understand this man.  They were alleging that he was sexually abusing and murdering black children in Atlanta,  and they wanted to hear what he had to say.  And then two shock jerks.  Shock jerks.  They decide not to call and just do the story without you.  The media is just repugnant.  We're available.  Where was he?  Where was the phone call?  How did I just compare you to Wayne Williams? 
[00:43:30]  I know.  That wasn't exactly the intention.  Yeah, I didn't really like that.  But I didn't mean it.  I didn't mind it.  He got a lot more done, by the way.  Jesus.  Let's go to Daryl in Michigan.  Daryl.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good.  Great show.  Thanks.  Thank you, sir.  I just wanted to remind you real quick.  You forgot to mention rocket scientists.  Oh, we weren't called rocket scientists or genius in this article?  Yeah, that's your other popular, you get morons and jerks, but rocket scientists.  I tend to think, and I don't like this, but I tend to think, I think they might be being 
[00:44:00]  sarcastic when they say rocket scientist or genius in some of the articles.  I don't know.  I consider myself well-educated, but I don't think I'm a genius.  It might be sarcastic.  I attempted to be a rocket scientist, actually.  Yeah.  But I couldn't get past physics 101 and said, ah, I guess it's not for me.  Is that it?  Screw the rocket science.  Right.  Leave it to someone else.  I'll go into broadcasting.  I used to launch the Estes model rockets.  Didn't make me a scientist.  I think I was more of an enthusiast. 
[00:44:30]  Hey, you guys got time for a couple of our comments about the show?  Uh, well, if it's going to throw us off track, can you just call back?  No, it's just about the, you know, I've been listening for about four weeks, and I'm  so I'm new to the show.  That'll be a month.  Yeah, right.  And I noticed you never say the phone number for people to call in.  It should be right on your display.  We figured it's nice and easy.  We get enough calls.  Oh, I got an older XM unit. 
[00:45:00]  It doesn't show up.  Oh, my God, on most of the new stuff, it's right there, which makes it so easy for us.  I don't even know what the number is.  I couldn't even tell you what it is.  Hawk, get the number.  I think there's a wow in it.  Yeah, it's like wow one wow or something, isn't it?  Hold on a minute.  How did you know the number?  Well, I went out to the web.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Because I had to see the Arthur G.N. video after that, but up until then, I had no idea  how to get a hold of it.  Oh, all right.  Well, maybe people can go to our website and the number's there.  I really don't know the number, because it's on all the displays. 
[00:45:30]  Nice.  Yeah, I've got to get a new unit.  All right.  Thanks, Daryl.  Thanks a lot.  Cool.  I'm glad you're enjoying the show.  I just want to add, look at that.  Four weeks the guy's been listening, or as Jimmy says, a month, been listening.  And it's a month if it was February.  Think how much material he missed.  Think of everything that we've done since we've been on the air that he just has no clue about.  You know?  Isn't that a shame?  Well, that's why we, you know, we say the same stuff over and over again, and some of 
[00:46:00]  the faithful listeners get frustrated, because there's a bunch of new people almost weekly.  Every day.  We've got to kind of clue them into a few things.  It's the kind of show, and I know it annoys the hardcore listeners sometimes, but it is  the kind of show where we have to kind of catch people up sometimes.  It's an ongoing soap opera, so you want to bring everyone up to speed, you know?  Yeah.  You want people to understand that you guys quote the goddamn Shining every fucking day.  I mean, oh, sorry. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  You like different movie quotes, Doc?  Wow.  See what happens when the blood sugar level drops?  I mean, I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry, guys.  He's got barrettes blurting stuff out.  I was thinking about that in the shower today.  I was thinking a great project for Danny and Nathaniel would be to get all the times  you guys have caught in the Shining.  Oh, yeah.  Just string that together for four hours.  It would be like watching Rain Man or something.  But a better one would be to get it together all the times we're going to.  Yep. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, Tyson's on Fox News.  Okay, anyway, let's get back to what we're doing here.  Let's say hi to...  What?  What?  Let's go to Mark in Oklahoma City.  Mark?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I think they're supposed to have a...  Why is Tyson in his underwear?  He was the way in.  Holy shit.  Did you see that huge armadillo shoved down the front of his underwear?  Did you see his...  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:47:30]  It looked like Saddam in the newspaper picture.  Did you see his rape stick?  What the fuck, man?  He does that to intimidate, because the guy he's fighting, the Irish guy, he was wearing  like sweatpants at the weigh-in.  Yeah.  And they stand looking at each other, and that's like the photo op.  Tyson is wearing tighty-whities and nothing else.  He's just wearing tighty-whities.  He's just a monster in his pants.  He's got a monster in his pants.  He's built like a fire plug. 
[00:48:00]  Fights tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to get it on pay-per-view.  It's going to be sad.  All right.  You are going to get it?  Yeah.  I got the last one.  It was entertaining.  All right.  Some of the preliminary bouts are pretty good, too.  Let's go to Mark in Oklahoma City.  Mark?  Hey.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  We're supposed to have a state execution next week, and they always have a lot of people  out there protesting, anti-death protesters or whatever, and me and a couple of buddies  are going to go down there with a sign for you guys. 
[00:48:30]  We're trying to think of something to put on it besides XM Satellite, like O&A says throw  the switch or something.  There you go.  That's nice.  Make sure you say O.P. and Anthony, because we've still got to get the name of the show  out there.  Right.  Eventually, when all these people become faithful listeners, then they'll understand that it's  just O&A.  Well, every once in a while, they get the nationwide Fox instead of the local Fox people out there.  Well, guys, I've got to tell you, man, New York is pretty much on to our assault on the 
[00:49:00]  media.  It's going to get a lot tougher around here.  Watch it out, boys.  So you guys in other cities are going to have to take this ball and run with it.  Yeah.  Because this is what happened when we did this at WNEW.  Eventually, the reporters will start doing their live reports from the top of the news  van.  Yeah, they get up on the news van.  They bring the camera up there.  They put the reporter up there and do the shot from the top of the van.  Yeah, because that's how they defend against this.  Eventually, that's what they will do.  And I think they're getting close to doing that. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  A couple more and it's over, Jim.  In New York, they're really going to have a hard time.  Because we've gotten full exposure now in New York City with this assault on the media.  So the other cities are going to have to come to the plate for us.  Yeah.  Because they're still unexpecting in those other towns.  That's right.  And look for things that are going on in your town, like big stories.  If there's a story, I don't know, at a water treatment plant, you know that they're going  to send a news crew down there.  A nice day, a hot record heat or something like that. 
[00:50:00]  Go to your city's parks, like Central Park.  I'm sure today there's going to be news crews out there.  Anthony, it's even easier than that because these news people are very lazy.  Okay?  You watch the news in the morning.  You see what the hot stories are.  They will do live shots all day long from that location.  From the location.  They're pretty much telling you where they're going to be later on in the day.  Absolutely.  It's not like they do one story from a subway rape scene and then move on to something else.  You are absolutely right.  They just go there all day long.  They're going to do it in midday news and they're going to do it in the afternoon. 
[00:50:30]  So you take a peek at the morning news and go, oh, wow, wait, that's close to me.  And you're guaranteed that they're going to do the noon news there, the 4 o'clock news,  the 5 o'clock, the 6 o'clock.  Very good.  Great pointer.  It's as easy as that.  It really is.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  You know what I can't stand getting, um, when you're talking about these teasers?  Like, for example, if you're watching Fear Factor at 8.30, during the commercials, they'll  say, they'll break in, they'll say something about terrorism related somewhere in New York 
[00:51:00]  City, 2 and 1 at 11.  I want to know what the fuck terrorism related is going on right now.  They make you wait three hours.  That's their teas.  That's their teas.  They've got to make their money.  They've got to, you know, they've got to get their ratings up.  They've got to get you watching longer.  And that's what they do.  So they know we're all, you know, have a little fear in us as far as the terrorism goes.  So that's how they hook you in.  That's how they do it.  Those idiots at Channel 4 always do it.  All right.  But we're the bad guys, sure. 
[00:51:30]  Look what we do.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  We're just having a little fun with their stupid, you know, newscasts.  Let's see.  That's a couple more here, and then we'll go back to the article.  Andrew in Indiana, what's up?  Ah, not much.  Just, uh, I'm actually on my way to work right now, and, uh, you guys were interested in trying  to find out if somebody else had ever been fired from the news for a live air blooper.  Right.  Well, if you go to ebombsworld.com and go into their funny video section, there is one guy 
[00:52:00]  in there that got fired for saying the wrong name for the television show and then cussing  on the air.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, there have been people thrown off.  There was that weatherman that got thrown off.  Yeah, he was a weatherman.  Martin Luther King Day.  Martin Luther Coon Day, yeah.  Yeah, he tripped over his words there and said Martin Luther Coon, but he didn't even say  that.  He said, like, Coon, and then stopped himself, and they threw his ass off.  That's right out of there.  All right, let's go to Fernando.  Fernando. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  Make it fast, because we've got to get back to this article.  No problem, man.  This guy is saying how inconsiderate.  How about these news reporters that, let's say there was a murder, and they got, like,  the wife or the child, and they got the mic in front of their faces.  How do you feel about what just happened?  Absolutely.  Yep, that's a little more intrusive than a sign behind the reporter.  Yeah.  They're self-important, and it's just great to see people realizing what self-important  asses they really are and attacking them.  Good. 
[00:53:00]  And, Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just want to let you know the technique over here at Kia.com.  Your technique for marketing was guerrilla marketing.  Of course.  Right.  You guys heard of that before, and second of all, you're right about those news people.  They're fucking lazy as hell.  They, I was out, but, uh, boardwalked there.  All right, thank you.  Let's get back to Richard Huff's column.  I really don't know.  He just wanted a call. 
[00:53:30]  He just gave us the information we had.  He just wanted to make a phone call.  He just needed to talk to somebody.  That was it.  He dialed the phone.  We were there.  Don't tell us what we already know.  Your pals, O.P. and Anthony, will take your phone call.  He had nothing.  You know, you guys, you're talking to those microphones.  It helps get that sound out into these radios.  All right.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  So, basically, where were we?  Okay, basically, they prepare their reporters to deal with this type of thing when they're  out there live, Anthony.  Moving on with the article from Richard Huff, who, once again, got to say, played right 
[00:54:00]  into our hands perfectly.  And he's attacking the fans.  He's not even attacking you guys.  He's attacking the fans.  Yeah, you never want to attack the fans.  We don't even attack them.  So, no, we don't even attack them anymore.  Keep them happy.  Keep them on your side.  They will eat us eventually, and it'll become their show.  You need them.  And we need to keep them well-fed with victims also.  Feed them with victims.  We keep coming up with other things.  Because the second they are victimless, we will become the victims. 
[00:54:30]  Eventually.  They will turn on us.  We'll all just be the mouthpieces of the fans.  We won't have our own original thoughts and ideas anymore.  This show will be run by them eventually.  We're the guy that owns that pit bull that turns around and rips the owner's throat out  after years of loving and petting and being with the kids in the house and everything.  Playing a fine pet, for some reason, it just spins around and rips your throat out.  You know how scared I actually get when I have to attack the message boards and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  You have to do it very carefully. 
[00:55:00]  No, I see it like a junkyard dog.  I see it like a junkyard dog.  We can walk up and kick them.  We can kick them.  That's fine.  But you better have that big piece of meat to throw down in front of them.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  I acknowledge them always as being pests and nuisance and idiots.  But we keep them well-fed with victims.  I make sure that big, thick chain is still on their neck.  Yeah.  So I'll go, oh, we can get to this point. 
[00:55:30]  All right, well, I'm going to move in a little bit.  Kick!  And move back.  Kick them.  But occasionally, they get a little pat on the head, too.  All right.  Yeah, you don't want to mess...  Good boy!  Good boy!  You don't want to mess with our pests.  No.  They are like Barlow, who's the vampire in Salem's Lot, where there's one part where he  actually has to murder and eat his own helper because the victim got away.  And he feels bad about it.  Yeah.  He's angry that he had to kill such a loyal servant.  Yeah.  That's how they will feel when they eventually wreck us. 
[00:56:00]  That's why keep them supplied with food.  The food is attacks on the media, other radio programs to call up, things like that.  We've got to keep it well stocked.  All right.  Pest.  Moving on with Richard Huff's column today in the Daily News.  It's a long article.  We're almost done, though.  Considering the website activity and planning of such stunts, there are online instructions  on how to pull off the prank.  We're far from the end. 
[00:56:30]  Ooh.  See?  He's right.  We're far from the end.  This will continue.  Yes, it will.  Well, after this article, I have no doubt that they're going to become more frequent now.  This is what we've been waiting for.  Yeah.  No recognition.  Major exposure.  No wonder they're hard to stop, especially on a public street.  And a similar stunt, of course, got reporter Arthur Cheyenne so fired up, he dropped an  F-bomb on air and was immediately canned by WCBS Channel 2. 
[00:57:00]  What the fuck's your problem, man?  Mad.  That was his problem in the end.  Sorry.  It just was.  Happened after that a couple of times, and the reporters kept their cool.  You didn't see old Battle blurting out the F-word.  That's right.  And she wanted to.  Of course she did.  She just spun in a circle and kicked up dirt behind her and chased some other cartoon character.  Jesus.  What?  She's got a Tasmanian devil body.  It's annoying.  It certainly does.  She's a boxy ass.  Battle.  Old Battleaxe.  What an awful, hard name. 
[00:57:30]  It is.  Battle.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  I think I'm going to go and fuck Pat Battle.  I know.  Pat Battle.  Pat Battle.  Pat Battle.  That is a hard-ass name.  And here we go.  Richard Huff showing his intelligence, but he can't help himself.  He cannot help himself.  And yes, I realize just writing about them will empower more of the weasels to hit the street.  He's calling you guys weasels. 
[00:58:00]  Weasels?  He can't do that.  Only we can do that.  This guy knew that if he wrote about it, it would make it worse, but he couldn't help himself.  He knew he had to say something.  He had to.  I'm so pissed off about this.  Dude, it's like reader Charles James says.  Yeah.  That's what you quote in your news story, you jackass?  Reader.  Got us a reader.  All right.  Trouble is, it's a campaign with no other purpose than to boost the visibility of Opie  and Anthony, who were fired by WNEW after encouraging a couple to have sex in St. Pat's Cathedral. 
[00:58:30]  That's right.  He hit it right on the head there.  That is the sole purpose.  Were we saying anything different for him to say in the paper like, well, the sole purpose  of this?  Yeah, contrary to what they're saying it's about.  No, we agree.  It's for attention.  It's to get our name out there.  And one of the great little side things about it is it's really screwing with the news, and 
[00:59:00]  we love that, too.  Yeah, we know we're underdogs.  We know we have to rebuild our careers, and this is what we do.  This is what we do now.  To get our exposure up and to get the name out for the show, and then eventually more  and more of these people will start listening to the program because they see Opie and Anthony  XM Satellite Radio.  There's a bunch of our old listeners that still don't know we're back.  Right.  And this is what helps that.  All right, so we were fired, blah, blah, blah.  It's not a creative prank.  It's annoying.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Hence the term pests.  And you know something?  Just because it's simple doesn't mean it's not creative.  It's creative, I would say.  It's a great idea to get press for your radio show.  It's free press on network television.  How is that not creative?  Absolutely.  Figure out a way for no money to get your name on TV consistently. 
[01:00:00]  How is that not creative?  It's not creative when a guy in a gorilla suit does it.  That is damn creative.  A guy in a Gumby suit?  Funny as hell.  Very creative.  Are you trying to tell our listeners to be more creative with this?  All right.  Take that angle.  All right, Richard.  Dick breath, if I will.  Guys, I don't think Dick Huff finds you creative enough.  I think you're going to have to step up, people.  All right.  I didn't know it was about creativity, Anthony.  Yep. 
[01:00:30]  And this next paragraph, I think it enraged Jimmy a little bit when we were reading it before the show.  At least when Howard Stern's fans called TV shows during breaking news,  they're supposedly proving that some of the media don't check references before putting sources on the air.  Oh, an A fan stunt isn't that smart.  Oh, an A's fan stunt isn't that smart.  No.  We're not trying to be smart.  No.  But do you see what he just did?  And this is why I hate him so much.  Because what he knows that he has to make, the Howard's fans have done stuff like that. 
[01:01:00]  And he knows he can't write this article and then not say anything about that because it's like,  well, where were you all these years that was happening?  So he has to make an angle on why that was okay and this isn't.  Because when they called during the 93 Trade Center terrorist bombing,  they called in the news or the Colin Ferguson massacre on the Little Island Railroad.  That was fine?  Or the Oklahoma terrorist attack.  Oh, Dick Huff had no problem with that?  Yeah.  I mean, I guess that was creative.  Which, by the way, those things were hilarious.  I'm not knocking Stern's fans for that. 
[01:01:30]  To me, those are the funniest things.  Oh, when you're sitting watching the news and the report is all serious and they're talking to who they think is like that chief of police in some town  and then they hit him with the Howard Stern reference or something, it's hysterical.  Well, how about the other one, the shooting in Los Angeles, LAX?  Yeah.  Artie took my job, the guy who called up as Jackie saying that he was the one who took the shooting.  He did the shooting because Artie took his job.  Yeah, so it's not the, those are hilarious things.  Right.  But don't self-righteously make this comparison like this is worse when those were actually guys who, 
[01:02:00]  they were truly interfering with the reporting of the news and as they should have been.  Right, right.  I love it.  Just what a scumbag this Richard Huff is.  I love when the news gets screwed with.  It is really fun to watch because they're so self-important.  They're so serious and they just are a bunch of bullshit artists.  And by the way, supposedly proving that some of the media don't check their references before, why?  Why don't you just say what it is? 
[01:02:30]  They're doing it to be funny, to get on Howard, which is why they should be doing it to be funny.  The fact that the media doesn't check their sources is how they get on, but they're not doing that to prove that.  Yeah, what is this, an experiment?  Yeah, there's no higher reason for it.  It's just funny shit and you guys are so greedy and so desperate to be the first ones instead of reporting accurately that you get caught out there sometimes.  Yep.  That's what it is.  There's no higher ethics for it or deeper motive.  It's funny.  T-Bones in Boston says, 
[01:03:00]  It's going to be creative when I bury the wow axe in a reporter's chest.  Our shining reference.  Ain't anybody at home?  Ain't anybody at home?  Well, I want to play something for Richard Huff today.  Here's a story about a rape.  Reporting here from the tub of the Overlook Hotel.  There, I told you guys.  There you go, new listeners.  I want to play this for Richard Huff today.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you. 
[01:03:30]  Shame on you, Richard Huff.  Shame on you.  Shame.  Shame.  You dope.  Played right into our hands.  And we're very happy about that today.  So, well, actually, thank you, too.  So, let's say hi to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say, I think it's fucking bullshit.  I think sensationalist journalists like to say that the alleged perpetrator of the bank robbery  allegedly went into the bank and allegedly shot the teller.  But every time the police have to put their hands in somebody,  you know, or force at the decision of having to kill someone, 
[01:04:00]  it's the police killed somebody.  You know, down here in New Orleans, they had to shoot a car close to 100 times just to get it to stop.  And they made it out like the police were just playing fucking cowboys and Indians trying to kill these guys.  But really, they were just trying to go home at the end of the night.  All right, Brian.  A little editorial.  Thank you.  Editorial?  Yeah, sure.  Well, the fact is, the media will say whatever they want as long as they put a ledge in front of it.  That's their little legal loophole.  That's their wink at the camera.  Yeah.  Allegedly.  Let's go to Mike. 
[01:04:30]  Mike, what's up?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey.  Two things.  First, up in Philly, 10 o'clock every morning, they do a TV show sort of like the Today Show in New York.  And they do it from the Lowe's Hotel in Center City on Market Street.  And they've got this big glass wall behind them, basically.  So, you know, you see people walking through the streets of Philadelphia.  That's a good opportunity for people up in Philly, New Jersey, Delaware.  You know, go down there.  See what's happening?  See what's happening, Anthony?  Because this is huge news today in New York, it's just making people call up with other opportunities for other pests. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  It's just trickling down the East Coast.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  The other thing is I think the media is pissed because, you know, you're not able to go off the TV and promote yourself, but they can't.  All right.  Thank you.  Sure.  These calls are almost making it, some of them.  They're almost relevant, almost contributing something. 
[01:05:30]  Eric in Colorado, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, my next-door neighbor is an assistant reporter or, like, an assistant camera person for the local CBS affiliate.  Yeah.  And right after this bit with Arthur Chan, they had a meeting with the camera people, showed them this video, and warned them of these kind of potential assaults.  I asked him, I said, what would happen?  I said, if I knew you guys were doing a live remote, and I came up with a sign, and he says, it's going to depend on who's working the camera. 
[01:06:00]  Well, the funny thing is they warned everyone here in New York after Arthur Chan, and we already hit him twice since then.  Yep.  Twice in New York already.  Well, and that's what I mean.  I've got a sign that I've made up, and I carry one in each of my cars and in the semi, just in hopes of getting one.  In fact, I had an assault.  I almost did about four months ago, but I would have gotten arrested if I would have done it.  Well, we don't want you guys getting arrested.  Well, yeah, because this was a huge structure fire at a facility. 
[01:06:30]  And as I went to go up to the reporter with the sign, this cop told me, if you do it, I'm going to nail your ass to the wall.  Yeah, but he can arrest you for what?  I would have had to cross the police line to get to him.  Oh, well, then he could have.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, so it wasn't worth it.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right, bye.  Bye.  That's what makes this fun is when you're not, you know, touching the reporters.  No, you just get up there and hold that sign.  You keep it legal, and you get a little creative with this, and it's just driving them nuts. 
[01:07:00]  Driving them nuts.  Roger Ebert gave the Honeymooners three stars.  He's giving everything good reviews.  Three stars.  He's giving everything good reviews.  Roger Ebert.  The Honeymooners is a surprise and a delight.  He really, he can't knock black people.  No.  We understand, we understand you have to make eye contact when you go home, but can you  for once knock a black film?  That is true.  He's married to a black woman, and it seems to have influenced his reviews on black films. 
[01:07:30]  Gee, Morgan Freeman's the best actor in the country?  I wanted to spit in his bad hairdo when I heard that.  He's not.  He's good in a grandfatherly way.  When he gave four thumbs up to Soul Plane, I knew there was a problem.  It was a delight.  A surprise and a delight.  It was a plane full of soul.  What else was a surprise and a delight when you found out you were going to have your own show?  No doubt.  The old tapioca skull was checking out. 
[01:08:00]  It's only one thumb matters now.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  It's the Oatmeal Brains and Ebert show.  Anthony, here's the deal.  The best website to go to for movie reviews is RottenTomatoes.com.  Right.  Because a lot of these critics have agendas like...  Ulterior motives.  Ulterior motives and agendas in general. 
[01:08:30]  RottenTomatoes.com.  They take all the reviews from all over the country, from all the major newspapers, and  then they throw a percentage of good reviews versus bad reviews together, basically.  And a fresh tomato, meaning the movie's going to be a success, is when 60% of the reviews  are good.  I don't know why I find that so funny.  Yeah, so you're getting it from people that have seen the movie, and it's now a realistic 
[01:09:00]  assessment of the movie.  Well, it's all the reviewers.  All the reviewers put together?  Yeah.  Can people that just watch the movie that aren't reviewers?  Yeah, I think they have message boards for that as well.  But basically, they take all the reviews of the Honeymooners from all the major papers  from all over the country.  And some of the movie review websites, things like that.  And what are the Honeymooners?  Honeymooners, 60% or greater means it's a good movie, according to RottenTomatoes.com.  In general, Honeymooners is getting a 20% rating. 
[01:09:30]  Ooh!  20% rating.  Ouch!  Scott Brown, Entertainment Weekly.  He just writes, so why remake this again?  USA Today.  These are all the bad reviews.  Cedric and Epps have none of the team chemistry Gleason shared with Art Carney, and Epps' Norton  displays none of Carney's...  Uh-oh.  Uh...  Uh, uh...  What's it start with?  E-centricities. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Phew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  Pshew.  hot. The Arizona  Republic. This laughless  attempt to modernize the Cramdons and Nortons  is somewhat  sacrilege,  as it waters down the characters and strips them  of their unforgettable quirks and ticks.  Not only an insult  to the original, it should be shown at  film schools as proof of how  pointless a movie can be. 
[01:10:30]  A lackluster  affair, devoid of laughs,  and just about anything else one might  construe as entertainment, Anthony.  Sounds like a surprise and a delight to me.  Well, the New York Times gave it a good  review. Surprise and a delight.  Did they really? Yep.  Actually, the good review  is The Honeymooners is not  so bad. That's what you want  in your review. It just  goes on and on, obviously.  The movie's story  actually does work as a story  and not simply as a 
[01:11:00]  wheezy Hollywood formula. Sometimes  you walk into a movie with  quiet dread and walk out  with quiet delight.  Delight.  Delight. He's  delighted.  Wow, this is weird.  Minneapolis Star Tribune.  What The Honeymooners does well,  it does very well.  The trouble is  it doesn't do enough of what it does well.  Ooh.  Okay.  Maybe this would have been a really  good movie, but people just kind of 
[01:11:30]  resent the fact that it has The  Honeymooners tag on it. Why not  just make it, we've said that  before, but just make it a movie.  Make it another movie.  Right.  Those guys are both famous enough to  pull it off and to bring people in.  Because now you, watching it,  you're just going to think of  The Honeymooners.  Right.  And compare it to it and  it's not going to work.  Just make it a movie.  Alright, so that's getting  horrendous reviews today.  Except for Ebert.  Yeah.  I like a movie that's a delight.  Hmm.  It's a bomb.  It'll make huge money, though.  You watch. 
[01:12:00]  Monday, you watch.  It'll make just ridiculous money.  The fact that they went to see  Monster-in-Law,  it's just mind-boggling to me.  Yeah.  She sat on enemy tanks  and smiled  while POWs were being tortured  and you fucking dummies  run out there and see her movies.  You make me sick.  He says,  This story isn't soft and mushy  like my ex-partner's  medulla oblongata.  Jesus. 
[01:12:30]  This movie isn't all stem,  no substance.  When you sneeze,  this movie doesn't rattle around  like Jell-O.  Oh, that poor bastard.  Oof.  Roger Ebert.  All alone.  I've begun eating finally, so.  Ah, the Opie eating portion  of the show has started.  Oh, my God.  I'm shaking really bad. 
[01:13:00]  I'll tell you one thing.  Hasn't the French toast  made this place smell wonderful?  All cinnamon and nice.  I haven't smelled it,  to be honest with you.  But if you like,  I can throw something else  into that mix.  Wave it around a little bit.  There you go.  No, throw something in the mix.  No thanks.  That happens later.  How was your smoothie yesterday?  Did it have any ill effects?  Well, yeah,  besides the dump I took  while we were on the phone,  I ran home,  and a couple hours later,  just another obnoxious,  miscolored dump.  Yeah.  Awful.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  The one I had was called  Dreams or something.  It turned into a nightmare.  I got home,  and wow,  beeline right for the bathroom.  My dump was a surprising delight.  Was it?  Yeah.  The consistency of Siskel's  brain matter.  It was really just,  oh, you know,  when you,  I don't want to get into details,  but you get done, 
[01:14:00]  and you turn around and look.  Sure.  You take a look,  and I just,  like out loud,  why,  why if I'm the only one  in the bathroom  seeing this,  do I actually have to go out loud?  Oh, God.  I turned around and looked,  and went,  oh.  And then you flush,  and it kind of holds up  for a second  and busts apart  like the Edmund Fitzgerald.  A trail of coal  all around.  I want to know  why do you wait  until the end  instead of just  opening your legs 
[01:14:30]  and you lift your bag  and peek down  while you're doing this?  I'm not going to peek  as it's working its way out.  Yeah,  why not just lift your bag  and take a peek  while the whole thing  is happening?  I want to make sure  everything is going smoothly.  Well, it is.  I don't disrupt your works.  It comes out,  and sometimes if you look,  it might change your mindset.  Nah.  I can't see back  to my bung,  but I can just see  that once it's in the bowl,  I can just look and smile.  That's horrible, man.  No way.  Oh, yeah, all the time.  I don't want to see it.  I love to see it.  I want it covered up  with paper,  and I turn around 
[01:15:00]  and look,  and good.  I say I don't see anything good.  I've actually smelled  the paper before,  I swear to God.  Oh, my God.  No, it's an animal thing.  That isn't even human.  It's how you know  you're sick.  That's awful.  You shouldn't do that, Jimmy.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  No more.  Bill needs coffee.  Huh?  Bill needs coffee.  You need some coffee?  Yeah.  All right.  Can we take a break 
[01:15:30]  so I can finish this?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, thanks, Travis.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  Greg from Florida  is on the phone.  I had that stuck  in my head, too,  all night.  I was singing this  like all night long.  Greg.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  New guy, new XM guy.  Man, that Greg  and Tony show, Greg.  Yes.  I was singing it  all night long.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  I feel like I got  an antenna stuck in my head. 
[01:16:00]  Is this what it's come to?  Yeah.  Well, that's a jingle.  See, this guy,  it might not sound  like a traditional jingle,  but it's done the job.  It's stuck in your head.  And even though  it's not Ophie and Anthony,  it's, you know,  the Greg and Tony show.  Greg and Tony show.  Let's do something.  What's up, Greg?  Tony show, Greg.  Tony show, Chris.  Tony show, Bob.  Did all of you  sex advice.  We know back.  Spread the hip.  It's not sick.  50 times in my head.  I love it.  It's like a dagger 
[01:16:30]  in the forehead.  You've got to love  something like that.  Yeah.  Well, we've got new ones today  and none of these  are going to get  stuck in your head.  I'm stuck in my  other part either.  Okay, hey,  love you all.  Have a good day.  Bye, mister.  Thank you, sir.  Later.  He's a new listener, Ophie.  Let's talk a new guy.  Let's go to...  Greg.  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Let's...  Game in Jersey.  What's up?  With a softball on it.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, talk base. 
[01:17:00]  Siskel.  Ebercho.  Siskel.  Ebercho.  Going to soon just be  Ebercho  because Siskel now  has to wear two baseball hats.  Siskel's got  mud in his head.  Rinse out his nose.  Go ahead, Gabe.  Sorry.  Got to reconfigure  those little chairs  at the dinner table.  Yeah, how many, uh,  honeymooners  does it take  the tar driveway?  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  I know.  Mm-hmm.  How many?  Two if you slice them 
[01:17:30]  thin enough.  What's wrong with you?  It's the old joke.  I was gonna get out of here  for a little while.  All right.  Eat.  Eat.  Like sand  through the hourglass.  So is the  O&A virus.  Let's say hi to  Dragon Wagon.  Get up, guys.  You  totally.  What?  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me  today.  You totally  You're talking  I was an over-the-road  truck driver  and just doing  these things 
[01:18:00]  that you're all  talking about  is ridiculous.  What are you  talking about?  The what thing, sir?  Did you take in  any histamine  before you call  next time?  A clog-nosed idiot.  It, it, it, it  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know,  I turned it on.  I'm calling XM  and complaining  about this channel.  Oh.  That's all of this  to it.  Really?  Yeah.  What, what don't  you like about  the channel?  Well, you guys  are, are hacks.  You wouldn't be  Howard Stern.  I mean, you know,  it, it, it, it 
[01:18:30]  beats it.  It's immoral  what you're talking  about.  You know what  you should do, sir?  Before you, right  after you call XM  you should drink a  fifth of Old Grandad  and then drunk drive  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about  you or if you're  offended.  Block the channel,  stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM  has that.  You need to F you.  That's what you  need to do.  Okay?  I'm hanging up.  Good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM  and drop dead.  Let's not go that  far.  All right.  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to  XM Kids or something. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, go, yeah,  exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong  thing to say in front  of Eric Logan.  And this guy,  now he's listening  to himself.  He'll be listening.  Listen, I'll go  into Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking  dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have  to drive a truck  to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back  of the truck,  you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of it.  I'll run you over.  Why don't you fucking  blow your nose  before you call  a national radio show,  you crank-doing  jerk-off? 
[01:19:30]  Now he's listening to  himself.  Of course he is.  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even  have the balls to say  fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You could say  fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar  and you're a failure.  Yeah, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road  truck driver.  Why don't you have  your fucking  sinuses fixed?  Yeah, all truck drivers 
[01:20:00]  are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through  lawns and pools.  You redundant shithead.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs  and surviving  an incest experience.  Break-up, break-up  for the dragon.  Is that his name?  Dragon Wagon?  Dragon Wagon.  You got your ears on. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You sounded like  you had more brains  on the radio.  Hold on, sir.  Wait, sir.  Is your name really...  Dude, is your name  really Dragon Wagon?  You're a grown man  with a name that rhymes?  Hey, slow down  with the weird  grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a childhood name. 
[01:21:00]  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie.  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck  rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything.  Shmanthony.  Well, if you don't understand,  I'm out of here  busting my ass  for you people  to be doing  your dumb radio show.  What are you...  How are you busting your ass  for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass  to put food  on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  No.  You're the type  that voted for George Bush,  aren't you?  You're the type...  No, sir. 
[01:21:30]  I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit  and then I sit home  on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason  the fuel prices are so hot  in this country driving...  I'm the reason  you motherfucker  you drive a truck!  I have a shatter  and I cruise prostitutes  in Manhattan.  Your food hurts to get there.  You have fucking  80 gallons of fuel  in your vehicle.  I go a month  on a gallon of gas.  43rd Street  to 15th Street  circled for four hours  back home.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:22:00]  Ah, feeling much better, Anthony. 
[01:22:30]  Ah, you at...  That's eaten.  Got some food in me.  Yeah, I'm the worst  if I don't eat.  Awful.  God, I feel like  I got needles in my nose.  Took the walk over  and there must be a...  a high pollen count  out there today.  Damn.  I have to go in  and shove some water  up my nose  and blow my nose.  Well, the rain is  knocking it all down.  Yeah, now it's raining.  All right.  We have so much 
[01:23:00]  to do today.  I don't...  I don't know.  We got some clips  from Sexy Estate.  Because we want to  maybe bring that back  for a little while.  Sexy.  We also have  Jingles  and also the show  I should have been watching  from the beginning  last night  instead of that  stupid MTV Movie Award show.  Hit Me Baby  one more time.  Oh, right.  Actually,  Elo called me  pretty drunk.  Jeez.  I think he was bummed  that XM lost out  on the Cousin Brucie. 
[01:23:30]  On Cousin Brucie?  Hey, like we said  in the 60s,  hey.  Nah, Elo's pretty smart.  He's actually  a very smart guy.  He understands  that it's not worth  signing Cousin Brucie  to a contract.  Yeah.  He's the oldies guy  that got fired  recently here in New York.  He's a legend.  He's been around forever.  But in the end,  how many people  really care?  Yeah, it's pretty much  a local, you know,  New York thing.  And it's pretty small  as far as how many fans 
[01:24:00]  there were in New York.  So, you know,  you're taking  a national platform  spending a lot of money  for some guy  who's, you know,  pretty local.  It's not that we're bitter.  There was a price  that XM was willing  to pay.  And, you know,  Sirius went and gave  him a lot more money,  which is just...  Sirius will just  hemorrhage cash  to get people,  quite frankly,  to get.  And what it is,  it's to get  a little bump  in the press. 
[01:24:30]  Because Cousin Brucie  gets hired  and then they  put a little story  in the paper somewhere  and that's all you get  for your $200,000  or whatever it was.  That's what you get.  We don't pay any money  and we get a whole page.  Yeah, we definitely  trumped...  What do we do?  We trumped a little  doggy company today  because this is  a whole New York thing.  Yeah.  You know,  so they wanted  to make a big splash  in the papers today  with the signing  of Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  And the reality is  their little article 
[01:25:00]  about hiring  Cousin Brucie  was buried  in the business section.  I mean,  buried deep.  And your pals  Opie and Anthony  and little Jimmy Norton  got to help  with their tests.  Huge exposure  with this assault  on the media thing.  So there you have it.  That's what we do now.  You guys want  to hear some jingles?  We got more jingles, huh?  Let's get these  out of the way for today.  Do you have the  Greg and Tony show?  Well,  I was going to start  by playing a few  of the ones we like  so far.  I still like the  first one that came in.  I do.  I like that one.  That's my second favorite. 
[01:25:30]  I like that a lot.  The creepy one.  Oh.  Well,  we'll go with this one first  and then we'll get  the new ones on.  There you have it.  That was Pappy.  This is my favorite  actually by Tall Man.  That is the best jingle 
[01:26:00]  we've got.  I love that one.  That's a pure jingle.  It just makes you laugh  every time you hear it.  Did you guys like  any of the ones  that came in yesterday?  Are they worth replaying?  Did I hear any of the ones  from yesterday?  Well,  like Norton and Friends.  Yeah,  we played some yesterday.  No real memorable ones  from yesterday.  Well,  this was one of the better ones. 
[01:26:30]  A couple of good ones.  From Shannon  from Toronto.  It's time for  Norton and Friends  in the morning  Norton and Friends  in the morning  Let's play  and the night  and the night  and the night  and the night  and the night  and the night  Yeah, that was good.  Oh, P is a shit day  Got some fans 
[01:27:00]  in Toronto, Anthony.  Jesus.  Doing it to an old  Billy Joel song.  Isn't that an old  Billy Joel tune?  Longest time.  Yeah.  And I circled this one,  I'm not even sure why,  by Johnny Griswold.  From New York City  to San Diego  it's the Spuds Buckley  and Burt Convy Hair Show  only on XM Channel 202  featuring  Media Tips on Sports  and the Bill Dead Lady  with the Weather.  I'm not kidding you, bitch.  Produced by Ben Tom. 
[01:27:30]  And if you keep adding  on,  I'm on Wackbag.com  lets you have  Rich Vosfinger  to tune your XM radio  to Channel 202.  Burt Convy Hair  and the Spuds Buckley.  I like that one.  I do too.  Yeah, that one's funny.  That one's really  starting to grow on me.  Burt Convy Hair.  Burt Convy Hair.  That one's starting  to grow on me.  That's great.  Let's see.  And then this one  from Ray from Deer Park.  This is the one  that started it all  and I still like it.  There's something about this.  What is it going? 
[01:28:00]  Oh.  I hate this one.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  Homophobic.  D-O-B-N.  Anthony Shaw.  There's one  that came in overnight  that's maybe even creepier  than that one.  Apparently the jingles  are blasting  and us and the mic  are hard to hear.  Oh, really?  I've heard on the replay  at home  there are so many things  that pop on  and we get blasted out 
[01:28:30]  and then we come on  and talk  and we're low again.  So there's still  that problem  that they've never really  fixed as far as  the levels go.  All right.  And the commercials  and stuff  come on really loud.  They come blasting on.  The channel in general  is just so much lower  than the other channels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean you're listening  to High Voltage  and then you're like  I want to go to Ethel  for a song  or I want to mellow out  with some fine tuning  or I want to see  what Hank's Place  is all about  and you go to the  whatever  you go to one  of these other channels  and your eardrums 
[01:29:00]  just get tortured.  Yep.  It just blasts you  out of the car.  They can't quite  figure it out.  It's really weird.  All right.  Let's see.  Here's the new ones  that came in overnight.  Crossed out most of them  but we still have a few  to play here today.  This is from Mike D.  Pew pew pew pew  O.B. and Anthony  O.B. and Anthony  Jim Norton and friends 
[01:29:30]  It's O.B. and Anthony  XM202  Yeah.  Wow.  I kind of liked the  pew pew pew  at the beginning.  It had potential, right?  He had no sound effects  at all.  Dennis from Delaware  came up with this one.  You are listening  to America's  favorite degenerates  O.B. 
[01:30:00]  Anthony  and little  Jimmy Norton  on XM  Saturday Radio  Channel 202  High Voltage  Oh, wow.  That was just  straight ahead.  Yeah.  That was straight up.  Very informative.  Straight up, yo.  Very informative.  Here's Jeff  from Long Beach.  All right.  All right.  That is the  creepiest thing 
[01:30:30]  I've ever heard.  That could be more  creepy than  Holy Jesus.  Let me hear that again  because that is like  the ring creepy.  No?  Yeah, it has that  feel about it.  It's creepy  like a horror movie.  I think he's trying  to say O and A  Party Rock  and then he says  Jim Norton  and then I think  he has a Ben  Fatcock joke  or something.  Really?  Because I can't  understand what  he's saying.  It sounds all  backwards and weird.  That's kind of the  fun of playing  some of these.  You've got to figure  out what the hell  they were trying  to say.  I don't like that 
[01:31:00]  at all.  Ben's Big Cock.  That's going to  scare me at night.  I heard Ben's Big Cock  O and A Party Rock  but there was  something else in the  beginning I think.  Ben's Big Cock.  I like it.  I do too.  Creepy.  I have a party rock  and get Will Boyd  and Ben's Big Cock. 
[01:31:30]  No, that's too scary,  man.  I don't like that  at all.  I like it.  Yeah.  Jeff from Long Beach.  All right.  This is Fat Monkey.  His attempt at an  One Jingle or Promo  or Sweeper.  I don't know what  the hell's going on  anymore with these  things.  Oh, yeah.  Mmm.  Oh, yeah.  Fee.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Norton.  XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:32:00]  Take XM Satellite Radio  along for the ride.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's not a jingle.  No.  That's a conglomerate.  These were the better  ones that came in  overnight, by the way.  You guys got your work  cut out for you over the  weekend to keep this bit  alive for us.  I'll say.  Here's one from Firebuck. 
[01:32:30]  Slack my British ditties  and call me a whore.  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony on  XM Radio.  Rock out with your  cock out.  Who's that sexy voice?  Rock out with your  cock out.  Who is she?  Who is that?  I don't know.  Is that from 9911?  I don't know.  Oh, I like that.  You know what's funny?  T-Bones in Boston.  Was it computer voice?  Oh.  Really?  Speaking of which,  how are you doing,  Steve?  I actually have the  lyrics from that one 
[01:33:00]  that you couldn't  understand.  The creepy one?  The creepy one?  Yeah.  It says,  O&A party rock and  Jim will point at  Ben's big cock.  O&A party rock and  Jim will point at  Ben's big cock.  O&A party rock and  Jim will point at  Ben's big cock.  O&A party rock and  Jim will point at  Ben's big cock. 
[01:33:30]  That's really creepy.  Sounds like it's  saying,  Kim will point.  Really?  I'm not.  You're not.  I'm Jim.  And it should say,  and Jim will take  pictures of Ben's  big cock.  Oh, Ben,  the flash came me  away.  That was so  goddamn funny yesterday.  We were in the  office after the show.  We had a little  phoner meeting with  Washington real quick.  And Ben's in there,  you know,  doing what he does,  getting the phone all  set and getting the  meeting all set.  And we're talking with  Washington.  And Jimmy pulls out 
[01:34:00]  his little camera and  just starts snapping  pictures of Ben's  cock.  like, he was zooming  right up on it and  taking a picture.  And then he was  getting up, moving  closer to Ben, and  without Ben really  noticing, because he's  doing other things, he's  herking and jerking, just  snapping pictures.  And then he's like,  oh, look, look, and  show me the picture of  Ben's cock.  And then, yeah, you  turn the flash on and  that ended the bit.  And Ben was like,  get out of here!  Covers it up, stood  behind a chair.  He was standing  behind the chair so 
[01:34:30]  Jimmy couldn't take  any more pictures of  his crotch.  It was a UFO, an  unbelievably fat object.  Our goal is to get a  whole montage of Ben's  crotch and throw it on  the website.  And all different  types of pants.  How self-conscious he  got when he realized  what was going on.  I would have stood  there and just pulled  my jeans tighter so  it was more properly  outlined.  But Shy Ben, like a  man with a true giant  hog, hid in an  embarrassed way.  So embarrassed.  This is really  interesting. 
[01:35:00]  T-Bones on  Instant Feedback.  He's begging us.  He's like, please do  not replay mine from  yesterday.  Who?  This guy T-Bones.  Was it bad?  Well, you know, a lot  of these people are  learning what happens  when you try to become  creative.  You don't want to hear  the feedback.  No.  And we killed T-Bone  yesterday and it  hurts so much he  doesn't want to hear  it again.  Well, let's hear it.  And boom goes the 
[01:35:30]  dynamite.  And boom goes the  dynamite.  All right, it's the  only virus spreading  across America.  Thanks, XM,  satellite radio.  Oh, yeah.  That one.  What was that?  An abortion.  And boom goes the  dynamite.  God, that stunk  again.  You rot.  There you go, T-Bone.  T-Bone?  Okay.  What were you  thinking?  We've got a couple  more to play and then  we'll move on to  something else. 
[01:36:00]  Was half the file  lost when you  emailed it?  Nice abrupt ending.  This is Drew from  Virginia.  His attempt at an  O&A jingle.  The most variety of  porn and smart  and trannies.  The O.P.  and Anthony  Show.  And Jim.  All right.  Almost.  Almost there.  I like the  and Jim tag.  So far, I only 
[01:36:30]  highlighted one.  Yeah.  From today's batch,  the creepy one.  This is T-Flame.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony  Show on XM202.  We've got Will  Chimney Norton,  your expert on  H.I.B.  And here comes  Professor Anthony,  the resident  note of everything  useless.  And O.P.,  the biggest asshole  in the Tri-Sale area.  Put on your laughing  hat and stab that  hooker. 
[01:37:00]  It's O.N.A.  Party Rod.  That's kind of funny.  What's the problem, man?  Wow.  That's kind of funny.  His recording  stinks.  Silly badly, but  stinks.  Professor Anthony.  It says,  it's the O.P. and  Anthony Show on  XM202.  We've got  little Jimmy Norton,  your expert on  HIV and transvestite  prostitutes.  Transsexual, not  transvestite, for  Pete's sake.  And here comes  Professor Anthony,  our resident  know-it-all on  everything useless.  And O.P., the  biggest asshole  in the Tri-State  area.  So put on your  laughing hats and 
[01:37:30]  stab that hooker.  It's O.N.A.  Party Rock.  Then he ends with,  what the fuck is  your problem, man?  Finally, the last  one to come in,  Anthony.  This was from  Lean Cuisine.  I want their  satellites shot  down.  So they can't  talk about me.  The virus is  spreading.  Hey, I kind of 
[01:38:00]  like it.  Not bad.  It's not quite a  jingle.  I wouldn't mind  hearing more of  those.  All right, I'll  circle that one  as well.  Not quite a  jingle.  More of a promo.  We got two today  that were okay.  Yeah.  Out of about  20.  Yep.  Those are the  ones that were  worth playing,  believe it or  not, for one  reason or another.  The rest of  them were really,  really, really bad.  Yeah.  Not even bad like  funny.  Just bad.  Okay. 
[01:38:30]  All right, we're  going to take  another break.  All righty.  Catch up a little  bit.  When we get back,  you want to check  out, hit me baby  one more time  from last night?  Yeah, we could  do that.  You had the  Knack singing a  Jet song, Anthony,  Tommy Two-Tone.  Tommy Two-Tone?  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Jenny Jenny?  He did Blink-182.  They sing their  hits though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Did he sing  Jenny Jenny?  Oh, yeah, we'll do  all that.  We'll do it like  we did last week.  Yeah, we play the  original the way you  remember it and then 
[01:39:00]  listen to him perform  it now.  Well, this is the  portion of the show  where we show you  guys that time  just stinks.  Time stinks.  Saw it last night  on the MTV Movie  Awards with the  Breakfast Club  Reunion and now  we'll show you  what it's like in  the music world.  And we'll do  that next.

[01:41:30]  All right, we're back. 
[01:42:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Keep the cop in studio today, hanging with us.  Good morning.  You ready to get your tickets for the cruise, really?  Billy Mac's boat?  Billy Mac's boat.  I think I'm going out on Billy Mac's boat for the 4th of July.  I think I am, yeah.  It's a nice little cruise up the East River.  The River Rose, is it called?  The River Rose.  How about the week is 4th of July?  Up the East River.  4th of July is on a Tuesday. 
[01:42:30]  It happens to be my birthday.  Happy birthday!  You're a Yankee doodle boy.  The 4th of July is on a Tuesday this year?  I believe so.  You were born on July 4th?  Yes, I was.  Who are you, Ron Kovick's?  And I'm from Massapequa.  It's Monday.  Oh, look at that.  Coincidental.  Coincidence?  It is Monday.  Isn't it Monday?  It's Monday.  I suck.  Do you know when your birthday is?  Oh, come on.  Everyone looks ahead on the calendar and goes, oh, this year it's on a Saturday.  Cool.  Yeah.  I get to party a little bit.  I can be alone on a weekend. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Monday.  Where are we going now, guys?  We've got so much here.  You want to do the Hit Me Baby one more time?  You want to do the Subway story?  Yeah.  We do have Keith in house today.  Yeah.  The Subway story is, let me take a look at that little piece of paper here.  There's a pervert rapist in the city, walking around the city.  I'm sure there are quite a few, but this is just one they're pointing out.  This guy, he raped a woman in one of the subway stations. 
[01:43:30]  And as a matter of fact, one of our assaults on the media is, the guy was doing the story  on this rapist.  Okay.  He apparently has a foot fetish.  What he did was, he's down in the subway.  It's the wee little hours of the morning in New York.  He goes down in the subway, finds an unsuspecting woman, and he started touching her feet.  And then he threw himself onto the floor, started licking her feet. 
[01:44:00]  So she runs to get away.  He grabs her by the hair, drags her into a doorway, and starts raping her.  So she screams.  Jesus.  Sex on the train.  Good find, Derek.  She screams, a train is coming by.  One of the trains, one of the subway trains coming by.  The guy driving the train there sees this going on, but he can't do anything.  He's not, you know, he can't stop the train, so he just radios ahead that there's a problem. 
[01:44:30]  There's also someone in one of the booths.  He hears a scuffle, what's going on.  He's told, it's policy, not to leave the booth, no matter what, because it could be some  kind of diversion to get him out of the booth to rob the booth.  So he's got a panic button in there.  He hits it.  By the time the cops arrive, she's already been raped.  The guy's gone.  There you go.  So apparently they got a description of him, and he turned up again, tried to rape another 
[01:45:00]  woman, and she was saved by a good Samaritan.  Some woman heard her screaming, came running up, said, hey, what are you doing?  The guy got up and ran away.  But here's how it went down, and, you know, you never want to blame the women, and I'm  not blaming her for anything she's, you know, not like presenting herself in any way that  would get some guy to rape her.  But what the fuck are these young women, early 20s, doing on the subway at 3.30 in the morning? 
[01:45:30]  You can't do it.  They're going home from the bars.  Take a fucking cab.  You can't afford it?  Have one less drink.  Whatever.  Take a cab.  Don't take the subway.  It's 3.30 in the morning.  Here's how this goes down.  The victim's nightmare began when she went to the station on her way home to the lower  east side after visiting a friend in Fort Greene.  She sat down, and a young man in his 20s who, quote, seemed normal, unquote, asked to borrow 
[01:46:00]  a pen, then handed it back to her and left.  Here's the thing we always talk about.  If it's 3.30 in the morning in New York, there is no conversation that should be going  on at all.  If someone asks you a question about anything, which way is north, to borrow a pen, what time  is it, excuse me, could you help me with this, and it's 3.30 in the morning, that person 
[01:46:30]  is looking to rob, rape, or kill you.  There is nothing else.  They don't want a pen.  They don't want to know what time it is.  They don't want to know which direction north is.  They are there to do you bodily harm, to rob you, to rape you, to kill you.  And that's what happens in the city to a girl, 21-year-old, 3.30 in the morning.  So what is going through her head that she's in the subway where it's secluded and alone 
[01:47:00]  enough where this guy can walk up to her?  Did you read the name?  Oh, yes.  The story continues.  Jesus, Jimmy.  After we borrowed the pen.  Yeah, asked to borrow a pen, then handed it back to her, and left.  I guess she figured she was off the hook, but as we know, and as I just said, there are  no conversations that go on at 3.30 in the morning.  He's looking to hurt you.  A minute or two later, he came back, and he was masturbating.  There's the old pen guy.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  He had to jot down, in two minutes, start masturbating in front of her. 
[01:47:30]  I don't want to forget, lady.  Thank you.  He had to sign something, and her pen ran out of ink.  At that point, she stood, looked at him, and said, fuck off.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program, your official fuck off t-shirt.  Fuck off.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  That would have been the perfect time to say that.  She tried to walk toward the station booth, but he blocked her.  Then he put the box cutter to my throat. 
[01:48:00]  He grabbed me by the throat, she said.  She was at his mercy, unable to talk.  I was pulling at his arms with both my hands, and that's when he got just loose enough so  I could breathe and scream.  And then he squeezed harder.  That's when I blacked out.  The woman came to and realized my pants were undone, unbuttoned, and unzipped.  Oh, boy.  And the woman that saved her, she, let's see. 
[01:48:30]  The sicko tried to choke her, tossed her onto the tracks.  He had me on my stomach, and he was pushing my head toward the third rail.  Had her on the stomach, you know, what kind of sex he wants, right?  But the woman had managed to scream help.  That alerted this other woman.  She was returning from a meal break.  She ran to the tracks and saw the man assaulting the woman.  I saw hands flailing back and forth.  I knew she was in trouble. 
[01:49:00]  The plucky trees, her name was, yelled, what the hell are you doing?  Startled, the attacker fled after grabbing his victim's backpack and running across the tracks.  He helped the woman, she helped the woman up off the platform and called the police.  But, did you see the picture of her, too?  They show her from the back.  They don't show her face.  She's a skinny, little white broad, down in the subway, thinking everything's fine and dandy at 3.30 in the morning. 
[01:49:30]  You're looking for trouble.  And if someone asks you something, run away.  Don't worry about looking like you're insensitive.  Don't worry about looking like you're racist.  Don't worry about it.  You could worry about that when you get home and lock your door.  It's like that Patrice bit.  You know, Patrice does a great bit about that whole thing.  He goes, don't worry about looking like a racist. 
[01:50:00]  He goes, if I'm in, you know, some southern city or town,  and he sees skinheads on the road ahead of him,  he's not going to walk toward them wondering if they're cancer patients.  He's going to run.  He said he didn't care if they're coughing.  Yeah, if they're coughing, I don't care.  Run!  Run!  Just run.  And that's what you've got to do.  At that hour of the morning, you have to constantly be aware of what's going on around you. 
[01:50:30]  Never even get in a situation where if one of these guys goes to ask you something,  that you're going to be alone.  Don't put yourself in that situation.  You walk into a subway car and there's just one guy on there,  and you're a woman, don't go in the car.  You're looking for trouble.  And when they start asking questions, run your ass off.  Run away.  Run, Forrest, run!  They don't need a pen.  They don't need the time.  They don't need to know which way is north. 
[01:51:00]  Because when you hear which way is north and you start describing it,  we talked about it.  Oh, I think, and what you do is you always turn,  and now you've got maybe the side of your face to the guy,  and you go, I think, and you point.  It's up that way, and the big meat fist comes at light speed  and smashes you in the side of the face.  Wham!  Bam!  And from which way is north, the next thing,  as your eyes flutter open in the hospital,  and you see Christmas decorations, 
[01:51:30]  and Christmas music is playing,  and there's cards from loved ones,  and there's plenty of them,  because they've been sending them for every holiday  and every birthday that's passed.  And you see people, and they look a little different.  Maybe your pals, who you just saw,  maybe his hair's different.  And you're wondering, why is his hairstyle different?  Why does Petey have a beard?  What is going on?  Why is Christmas music playing?  I was in the subway, and it was hot July. 
[01:52:00]  Why does my wife look pregnant?  What's going on?  Because she gave up on you.  Who is that young man?  And where's my young eight-year-old son?  She moved on with her life, started banging the neighbor,  and all of a sudden you wake up,  and she went, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Uh, well, I'd better go to the hospital and say hi to him, at least.  Bam!  Meat fist to the face.  That's what they do.  They don't need a weapon.  They ask you a question,  and so you don't want to look insensitive 
[01:52:30]  or look like you're prejudiced.  You sit there and try to answer it,  because you think that,  oh, I'm not going to look like the bad guy,  and meat fist.  Bam!  See, your answer is too simple to the problem, though,  by saying that, uh, just take a cab.  You see the accident that happened overnight?  You know something, though?  That happens all the time.  That's going to happen.  There's a picture, uh, I guess it's in the Post,  one of these papers,  where, um, a cab rear-ended another cab  and went under the cab in front of it.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  To the point where his whole hood was scrunched way...  Back to the windshield.  All the way back to the windshield.  And the other car was up on top of the hood.  Yeah.  It went right under it like a...  How did that happen?  ...like a doorstop.  How does that happen?  Uh, I would think, uh, he's going way too fast,  like the cabs do.  The other cab probably dead stop.  At the last minute,  the, uh, cab that's, uh, coming up on him  jams on the brakes.  Now the front of the car dips down real low  because he's jamming on the brakes.  Gets under the bumper. 
[01:53:30]  Boom!  Right up into the windshield.  And he pops him right up onto the windshield.  Yep.  It's an amazing picture.  But that's going to happen.  These cab drivers are insane.  They drive like mad people.  And Seinfeld had that old bit  that said for some reason  when you're in the back of a cab  you don't care how they're driving.  It's not...  It doesn't scare you.  It's like you're watching a movie  out the windshield.  He could be up on the sidewalk  and you go,  yeah, that's a good move.  I'd have done that.  That's good.  You don't feel like you're in danger  in the cab for some reason.  He's weaving in and out of traffic  where if it was one of your friends 
[01:54:00]  you'd be cursing at him.  Hey, slow down, asshole.  You're going to get us killed.  But in a cab?  Eh, it's fine.  Guy's hired by the city.  He's got to know what he's doing.  Let's go to Bobby in Lodi.  Bobby?  Bobby here.  One night,  me and my wife  went to the comedy cellar actually  and we had a good time  but we closed a really late show  so when we came out  we were walking out  down McDougal  and on the side of the street  right by the park  a couple of guys  in a car were hanging out  and one of them  was hanging out the window  and going,  excuse me, dog. 
[01:54:30]  Can I ask you for directions?  Dude, me and the wife  totally ran.  Out of there.  Done.  Just run away.  Dude, we knew what was coming  if we were like,  yeah, where do you guys need to go?  Dude, out of there.  Give me fist.  Watch out.  All right.  Bam!  Ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Sometimes I think they want to see  if you're tourists too.  Sometimes in New York  because I've given directions.  Yeah, four blocks that way.  I think they want to know  if you know what you're talking about.  Like if they think you're a tourist  that you might have a better shot  of getting smashed. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, true.  If you look confused.  Hey, which way is out  Washington Square Park?  Two blocks that way.  They at least know  that you're not a tourist.  I just, right when they start going,  excuse, like,  they don't get a word  out of their mouth.  I throw my arms up in the air  and go,  ah!  That's what I do.  And I walk away.  I go, ah!  Like I'm a crazy person.  I love that.  Just, ah!  Just that, yeah,  act crazy.  Act like a lunatic.  They'll leave you alone.  Anthony,  here's the Jerry Seinfeld  cab driver bit.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's quick.  So what's with the cab drivers 
[01:55:30]  in the B.O.?  How long are these shifts?  Do they ever stop  or do they just get in the cab  and just drive  till they're dead?  That's what it's starting  to smell like  in some of these cars.  You're in the back there  and you're going,  oh, man.  And then they give you that,  they have that cherry stuff,  the cherry poppet  on the dash.  You know,  so you get the cherry B.O.,  which is supposed to be 
[01:56:00]  some sort of improvement,  I guess.  I don't know.  I can't imagine even  fruit going that long  without showering.  And the way they drive  is someone saying,  you can see they're upset.  I don't know what it's like  to drive a cab.  It must be very difficult  because they're very upset,  these people.  And sometimes you just want  to lean over that seat  and go,  what is happening in your life  and your mind  that is making you drive like this?  Take it easy.  To me,  the really funny thing  about New York cab  is you never really get that scared  when you're in the cab.  I don't know why.  Something about being in Manhattan, 
[01:56:30]  no matter how dangerous it seems,  it's all quite amusing  in the back of that cab,  isn't it?  He's flying around the road,  he's doing 90 up a one-way  and you're going,  I've never tried that in my car.  It's all a huge joke.  It's your life.  And somehow it's all  happening on TV there.  It's all not quite real.  The dumbest thing you can think  in the back of a taxi cab is,  well, I'm sure the man  knows what he's doing. 
[01:57:00]  Have you ever thought that?  He is driving fast  and quite recklessly  on ball timers.  But after all,  he's a professional.  I guess he does this all the time.  He's got a license.  I can see it right there.  I don't even know  what it takes to get  a cab driver's license.  I think all you need  is a face.  This seems to be  their big qualification.  That's the law now.  No blank heads  are allowed to drive cabs. 
[01:57:30]  It also helps to have a name  with like eight consonants  in a row.  Well, what is that O  with the line through it?  What letter is that?  I don't remember  that letter in school.  You need a chart  of the elements  if you want to report  the guy.  Yes, officer.  His name was Amal  and then the symbol  for boron.  I believe.  I had the periodic chart 
[01:58:00]  with me at the time.  I'm quite certain  it was not manganese.  Ah, there you have it.  Not bad.  Jerry Seinfeld.  One of his classics.  How's Jerry doing  these days?  See him around the club,  Jimmy?  I haven't seen him  in a while.  Yeah?  Comes on the comedy  show once in a while.  Yeah?  Works out.  Oh, we're staying up in New York  but I have not seen him  in a little while.  That film he put out.  Comedian?  Yeah, Comedian.  I liked it.  It was really good.  I liked it a lot.  Because you see,  obviously you see 
[01:58:30]  the early Jerry Seinfeld  things.  They pop up on HBO  every so often.  And then he just had  the hugest hit ever,  ever with Seinfeld.  And then when you're  done with that,  you figure,  what do you do?  And this guy just  went back to the clubs.  Went back to doing  comedy clubs  and corporate events  and things like that.  And they kind of  documented in this film.  And it's weird  because you see him  on Seinfeld,  just a huge star,  multi-millionaire  from the show.  And there he is  all insecure 
[01:59:00]  about his material  and wondering  if the corporate gig  went well  and asking people  backstage and stuff.  Really gave you  a new insight  on Seinfeld.  I watched him  shoot that whole thing  at the Comedy Cellar.  That was shot  at a table at the Cellar.  Also at Stanton,  New York,  in the awful  Gotham Comedy Club.  Solid fucking box,  that is.  Can't put you on.  We got bringer shows.  Bringers, Jimmy.  Yeah, no,  it's more important.  Thanks for tonight's show.  I appreciate that.  Who'd you bring, Jimmy? 
[01:59:30]  Exactly.  No one.  I should have brought  Arthur Ashe and Tommy Morrison  and had them bleed on the owner.  But yeah,  a comedian,  to me,  I would rather have seen  what it is that makes you  want to do that  to begin with.  I would like to know more  because Seinfeld  is such a clean-cut guy  and his material  is very funny  and he's clean-cut.  I would like to have  gotten a little deeper  into what causes him  to have to be funny.  There's that personality  defect in there somewhere  which I would like  to have gotten to kind of know.  Like what's his?  I'm sure he has it.  Maybe it's OCD. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know what it is.  I kind of found  the opening up  to the whole insecurity thing  pretty cool.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  For a comic to watch that,  you probably look  a little deeper into it  than I did.  Yeah.  I went to,  I guess the part  that we all laughed at  because you know  how it is when you go  to a premiere.  You know.  What a dick.  No, no, no.  Just, you know.  Yeah.  We know, of course.  And Orny is actually  a buddy of mine.  The obnoxious comedian  that Jerry was working with  is actually a guy  I like a lot.  And he's just,  no one liked him in that. 
[02:00:30]  And that was the part  that all the comedians  were laughing at  was every time  Orny would say something  which is just like,  you fucking idiot.  What are you talking about?  All the comics would laugh.  I'm giving George Shapiro  a gift.  What?  What are you talking about?  You fucking kook.  But Orny is actually honest  because he said one time  he went to see Comedian  in the theater  and he's sitting behind  these three girls  and it's towards the end  of the movie  and he was going to meet them  after because look at me  I was just on the screen.  Yeah.  And in the movie  he goes to say something  and one of the girls 
[02:01:00]  in front of him  just goes,  oh, shut up already.  She didn't know  he was behind her.  Oh, that's funny.  And I saw Orny  at the premiere  and he's like,  don't hate me  like when you see this.  He just knows  he's hateable.  It was just the way  it was edited  and stuff like that  which was actually  pretty funny.  Yeah.  He's a guy that you  like you watch that  and you're like  there's no way  I can like this guy  but he's actually  a good dude.  He's just a fucking maniac.  All right.  So that was my favorite  part of it  was kind of watching Orny  be a lunatic.  And then Letterman  wouldn't let him say lupus.  That enraged me. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, that's weird.  They got some kind of  weird rules over there  where diseases are off limits.  Anything, anything.  Here's your testicles  leave them at the door  now go be funny in a suit.  Meanwhile Leno's doing  a pedophile joke.  That's why I love them.  I swear to God  even if I wasn't  who cares if I'm on the show  Monday.  Boo hoo for promos.  Right.  I'm starting to see it  your way by the way.  Dude, I used to be  a huge fan of Letterman  but I'm starting to see it  your way.  That guy just  is a comedian  you watch the content  of what they  I'm not saying Letterman's  not funny or Letterman  just hasn't done 
[02:02:00]  a tremendous amount of  but the idea of Letterman  being the hip New York show  I think maybe when  Johnny was at the end  and Johnny was the  more traditional guy.  Right.  He was the  hip young guy.  He's the younger hip guy  who comes along.  That's done now.  Even though I still  preferred Carson  but I mean Letterman  I could see being the  hippie would have  Ozzy Osbourne  and all these like  weird things he would  do that no one was  doing but as time  has gone on man  it's like the big  New York hip guy  I'm sorry but you  can get away with more  and I'm telling you  as a comic  the Tonight Show  you can do a lot  more content.  I changed my whole 
[02:02:30]  set for this  and I sent it out  and I'm like yeah  we got a couple of  notes that's it.  No fucking let me  go see every set  you're doing  and chop your nuts  off and obsess over  it.  None of that stuff.  None of that stuff.  Monday.  Yeah.  Hopefully it'll go well.  Nice.  I hope it doesn't suck.  That's really exciting.  Well you know what I'm saying  it's just that they don't  chop your balls off.  The hip guy now is  Conan.  Conan's hysterical man.  He's amazing.  It is so god damn funny.  I hope they don't cut his  balls off when they  move him up.  Well he'll go to the  LA.  Eventually.  No I mean you know  I mean he's getting 
[02:03:00]  away with a lot  technically because  it's later at night  too.  I'm wondering what's  going to be you know  what they're going to  make him soften up a  little bit when he  goes to 11.30.  Or try to get more  mass appeal so they'll  take some of those  quirky things he does  out of there.  Some reason I don't  his head writer actually  is a comedian named  Mike Sweeney who was  actually at the cell  last night.  First time I've seen  him in years.  Yeah.  Really funny bastard  man.  Really funny dude.  And I've never been a  Conan fan.  I think I don't like the  guy that books the show.  Really?  Yeah.  I think that's probably  why.  The show is hysterical. 
[02:03:30]  You see the little  Jay Leno character  comes driving out.  It's the midget that  they dress up and he  looks like Jay Leno  and he doesn't say a  word.  He just drives in a  little car and makes  Jay faces and drives  across the stage.  That's pretty funny.  It's really funny.  Alright.  Why don't we get into  Hit Me Baby one more  time.  Alrighty.  This is the show to  watch I'm telling you.  It's getting huge ratings  and I think most people  are watching going oh my  God what a disaster.  What a beloved  nostalgia.  What a train wreck.  Well that's why you  watch to begin with but  then you realize this 
[02:04:00]  is just funny.  Just funny.  So basically the  concept of the show  they get some bands we  grew up with I guess.  Last night it was The  Knack, Tommy Two  Tone, The Motels and  Vanilla Ice.  Oof.  So it's these bands  you're wondering whatever  happened to them you  know.  Yeah.  So they come out and  they do their big big  hit for everybody live  and then they come back  later in the show and  they do a brand new  song from an artist  that's hot today.  Very good.  It's a very good  concept.  I like it a lot. 
[02:04:30]  A little weird.  So basically like The  Knack they did My  Sharona and then they  did Are You Gonna Be My  Girl by Jet.  Are You Gonna Be My  Girl by Jet.  All right.  And then Tommy Two  Tone did you know  Jenny Jenny.  Of course.  And then did All  Small Things by Blink-182.  It was horrific.  Really?  How awful it was.  And then the Motels  did Only the Lonely  and they did a Nora Jones  song.  And then Vanilla Ice  did Ice Ice Baby.  I heard he nailed it. 
[02:05:00]  I haven't.  Really?  Yeah I didn't see that  part because I was too  busy watching the stupid  MTV Movie Awards.  And then came back and  did Survivor from  Destiny's Child.  Oh.  He's rapping though so  that's a little easier to  keep your voice.  That's true.  If that's what you want  to call it.  But that's like talking.  He's a little bit easier  to do than sing.  He finally gave up by  the way because he  didn't want to acknowledge  Ice Ice Baby anymore  and he wanted to be  the new Vanilla Ice  and he was trying  to listen to my new  music and wouldn't  even really discuss  the old days.  Now there he is.  But on that surreal  life when they were  doing the karaoke in 
[02:05:30]  front of him they were  doing Ice Ice Baby  and then they handed  him the mic and he  was at the table and  he finally went with  it and said alright.  Yeah.  And now he's going  with it a little bit.  He's embracing it.  How about changing  your name?  His past.  From Vanilla Ice.  Maybe that's the  problem.  It's hard to get  street credibility when  your name is Vanilla Ice.  You're a little fruity  thing sold by Italian  men in Central Park.  Yo motherfucker  Cocoa Puffs here.  No one wants to hear  that shit.  It's corny and it's  awful.  Alright so why don't 
[02:06:00]  we do what we did  last week Anthony.  Yep.  Basically the knack  My Sharona.  Why don't we play  the studio version  of My Sharona  a little piece  and then we'll play  the version they did  last night to pretty  much show you that  time is not kind.  Time blows.  Oh my little pretty one 
[02:06:30]  My pretty one  When you're gonna give me  some time  Sharona  Oh you make my motor up  My motor up  Got it coming off  of the light  Sharona  I'll have some  Give it up  Such a dirty mind  I would get it up  For the gosh  Of the younger kind  My, my, my, my  Yeah  Woo!  My, my, my  Sharona  Everyone remembers that. 
[02:07:00]  What year was that?  You got the idea.  I think that was like  early 80s, late 70s.  I'm gonna go with  1979 Anthony.  1979.  78.  CBF  Uh, 19  Where are we?  1971.  Stop.  71.  Jesus.  What are you doing, Eric?  Eric.  You don't get to the  right year soon  There's gonna be a problem.  It's like that on the  computer.  Eric, what are you doing?  Hawk.  He's panicking.  Oh, he's going to  the internet?  Little child's hat 
[02:07:30]  Could you please  find this properly  and wear your hat  like a fucking  someone over the age  of six in 1940?  Little child's hat  Your hat did shrink  I think.  That hat stinks.  Oh my god,  what happened to it?  I don't like that hat.  Oh, it's a little  Mets hat.  He's wearing like  the little fat  baseball gloves  that they wore  in the 30s.  He's trying to  pull it down  There's no way  to pull it down.  The hat should have  little Adam Walsh's  head in it.  Jesus.  He's a firetruck  though.  Give me that  Oh, God. 
[02:08:00]  1979, right there,  no?  Is it?  I want to call it  1979.  1979.  Maybe.  I don't know.  That was so uncalled.  Isn't that just awful?  Oh, my God.  All right, here we go.  Same song done last night  on the hit program  for NBC.  Hit me, baby.  One more time.  Oh, my little 
[02:08:30]  pretty one  My pretty one  When you're gonna  give me some time  Oh, you make my  motor up  My motor up  You got me  coming off  of my life  Oh, you're never  gonna stop  Give it up  Such a dirty  But I always  give it up  For the touch  of the other kind  Bye, bye,  Bye, yeah, yeah  That ain't bad.  Not bad, right?  You know, live like that? 
[02:09:00]  That's really not that bad.  Trouble with the harmony.  Shaky.  It's really not that bad, right?  It's not that bad at all.  Yeah, yeah.  That was pretty good.  I gotta agree with you on that.  And that's like one of the bands  that you're going back  farther than any  of the other bands.  A lot of the other bands  are 80s bands.  Right.  They were, you know,  late 70s with that song. 
[02:09:30]  And then they came out  later on and did  Are You Gonna Be My Girl  from Jet.  All right.  Not a bad choice,  by the way.  Kind of fits their style.  Ten, one, two, three,  Take my hand and look at me  Cause you look so fine  That I really wanna make you mine  She look so fine  That I really wanna make you mine  Four, five, six,  Come on and get your kicks 
[02:10:00]  That you don't need money  When you look like that  Long black boobs  Long brown hair  Look so cute  When you give back stuff  I can see  You're holding me  That you were with another man  And no, we ain't got  Much to say, but  Before I let you get away 
[02:10:30]  I say  Are you gonna be my girl  Not bad.  No, it's fine.  Yeah.  Gotta give him that.  I gotta go to the phones  and say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt?  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm a fan of you guys.  I've been listening to you guys  for a while.  You guys continually describe  dead children and HIV infection.  Are you guys concerned 
[02:11:00]  with karma  that some of this stuff  might come back  and haunt you guys?  Yeah, guys.  No, because I constantly  describe blowjobs  if karma had the...  The other thing with you,  Norton, is you come on the air  and claim like you can't  get a chick.  I mean, don't you think  these chicks are a little bit  concerned that you  banging whores every other day?  Why would they wanna be with you?  I don't care.  Let them not wanna be with me.  And by the way,  should Al Pacino be concerned  with karma  when he plays a Cuban drug dealer?  Or should De Niro  be concerned with karma  when he plays a guy  who beats up his wife?  That's a movie. 
[02:11:30]  You guys are on the air.  When you talk about...  Dude, hold on.  Dude, dude.  Bro, it's not...  Why is it different?  Why...  This is what I'm talking about.  This double standard  people have for humor.  Why is it different?  Dude, listen.  What's funny about a dead kid  floating in the water  with his dead mother?  Nothing.  That's why...  That's why...  I'm answering your...  Stupid.  I'm answering your question.  Nothing is funny about it.  That's the challenge  and the humor.  You wanna hear fart jokes  all day?  To me,  the challenge and humor  is to laugh 
[02:12:00]  at what you shouldn't laugh at.  That's why I...  It just seems  that all the jokes  you make about HIV,  one of these days,  you're gonna get it.  Really?  Is that why I get it?  Because I made jokes?  Or maybe because I have  unprotected sex, stupid?  Gonna?  How about Ryan White?  Did he make jokes  about HIV  before he caught it  when he was a kid?  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Do you wanna talk  about karma?  What caused him?  If karma means anything,  why did he get AIDS?  Huh?  What did that little kid...  And how come Nazis  lived to...  There are quite a few Nazis  that lived to a ripe old age  and died peacefully  in Brazil somewhere.  But how does that explain 
[02:12:30]  you make jokes  about a dead kid  floating with his mother?  I'm talking about  your dumb karma argument  because behavior  is what would cause karma,  not stupid things  said in humor.  It's something to think about.  No, it's not.  It's dumb.  Your argument is dumb.  You're like a fat  fucking car-playing  wash woman.  It's not something  to think about.  You're calling me fat  and look at your  fucking body,  you pale scallop.  Now he's got a point.  Yeah, I know that.  I talk about myself.  Karma.  I trash myself constantly.  And then you come on the air  and say you're confused  why you can't get a girlfriend.  I'm not confused, stupid. 
[02:13:00]  I'm not confused.  You're talking to the whole country  about how you bang skanky hookers.  Yeah, sorry, I'm honest.  I don't hide behind  what you hide behind,  which is your fucking anonymity  and your little secrets  that you have online.  I'm a pig  and I'm open about it.  Too bad if you don't like it.  Adam Walsh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  LOL.  And these chicks  are going to want to be with you.  Ah, too bad if they're not.  I'll give them money.  Or guys like you  will fuck your girlfriends  when I'm on the road.  That's what I do.  Yeah, I know.  My girlfriend would be wanting  to have sex  with a fucking ugly little alien  with a guy like yourself.  Maybe she wouldn't.  Maybe she's just happy  to fuck you  for the rest of her life  in your awful 9 to 5 job.  Good for her  and good for you. 
[02:13:30]  Keep paying for sex.  I will.  That's the beauty of me.  Why do you drive a car?  Why do you have  any type of success  in your life  to get pussy?  I'm just honest.  I cut out the middle man.  I have fat tits  in an appendix scar.  Here's a couple of hundred.  Give me what I need.  Oh, it's a great way.  And the chicks,  I'm sure they're lining up.  Dude, you're repeating  what I talk about.  You're not hurting  my feelings, you idiot.  Oh, you know what, though?  He's got a good point.  This guy probably  works hard for a living.  Wants to go home  and see his girl.  This is the only  kind of karma we need.  Yeah, but you're 
[02:14:00]  talking about karma.  What point are you making, stupid?  Karma chameleon.  I know.  Where is he?  Matt?  Hello?  Nah, I lowered him  in the mix  so he might have thought  we were done with him.  Just so he could  play your calming music  to calm you down  a little bit, Jimmy.  I don't care if somebody  likes that type of humor,  but when it comes  to this dog shit  karma argument,  shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  I wonder why  we chuckle hysterically  sometimes.  Because it's awful.  It's the most awful thing.  And it's because 
[02:14:30]  it's so bad  and there is no way  you should find  any humor in it  and put in a certain  dark context,  you find it funny.  Why should there be  any limits on what  you make fun of?  Why should there be?  Other art forms  don't have any limits  on what they can address.  Why should humor?  Behaviors are what counts.  Not the way you fucking  deal with those awful things.  That's what humor is.  It's to face those  awful things  and find a way  to deal with them  and to me,  that's what humor  has always been.  Very few good looking  happy people are funny,  you stupid ass. 
[02:15:00]  Humor and misery  do go hand in hand  and it's not a conscious  pseudo archy  I wear black  conscious decision.  It just is what it is.  So tough shit  if you don't like it.  Listen to a happier show.  Listen to Cousin Brucie.  That's what we say  in the 60s.  Listen to that shit.  Watch Joey on NBC.  That karma thing  is really weird too  because I'm convinced  that in general  we make so many  more people happy  and we make them laugh  than are pissed off at us.  So where's the karma?  Yeah, if you've been  listening for a while,  dude, if you don't like 
[02:15:30]  that type of humor,  we still do it.  Why are you still listening?  Turn the radio off.  Shouldn't we get  some really good karma  coming back our way  because we're making  people happy  on a daily basis?  The whole argument  is dog shit.  What did the Yates husband do  to deserve having  his five children murdered?  What kind of karma  was that?  Married a kook.  Exactly.  Maybe she had a good clip.  Well, it was something  he did in his past life.  Yeah.  He had to come back  and suffer.  Karma.  Ugh, you fucking flake.  Shut up.  Alright, let's go on here,  Anthony.  Tommy Two-Tone. 
[02:16:00]  Hit me, baby,  one more time.  867-5309.  Everyone remembers this.  Why don't we call that number  and see who's...  Hey, let's call it!  I remember Bob Buckman  used to do that at BAB  when that song was huge.  He would play the song  and in the background  you'd hear it and he'd go,  we're going to try  this phone number now,  867,  and try to find Jenny.  And people would answer  the phone and he'd be like,  hey, it's Bob Buckman.  Hey, is Jenny there?  Is Jenny there?  No.  Alright, well,  we're going to try again later.  She was, by the way,  a real lighting girl. 
[02:16:30]  Her real name was Jenny  and that was her real number.  Oh.  Very nice.  That was her number.  Well, here's a piece  of the original.  With the long intro,  of course.  Of course.  Jenna, Jenna, Jenna.  Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,  who can I?  Tarno.  You give me something  I can hold on to. 
[02:17:00]  I know you think  I'm like the other people.  Of course.  We saw you  name the number  on the wall.  Oh.  Danny, I got  your number.  I need to make  you mine.  Danny, don't change  your number.  Everybody!  All right, we all remember, of course. 
[02:17:30]  Well, let's see if...  Boy, did that self-righteous motherfucker really annoy me.  And then he starts stealing my lines to use on me.  You look like a scallop.  Do I really?  I already said that?  What's funny about a mother and a kid laying there?  Fuck you.  Have that conversation with your idiot union friends.  You hear the thing they said?  I couldn't believe it either.  Fuck you.  Jerk off. 
[02:18:00]  What's funny about it?  Everything.  God damn it, this is a good song.  Camo.  Camo.  Camo.  Wow.  Don't ruin the karma chameleon bit, by the way.  Oh, no, I wouldn't.  It's a happy song.  Try to use your powers against you.  Really, really.  Why don't you just call Patrice fat, stupid?  I know I'm a mush.  Ugh.  All right.  Let's see if time matters. 
[02:18:30]  I've been listening for a while.  Then stop listening.  How about them apples?  Quit listening.  Take your guilty pleasure and fucking give up on it and go with something else.  Right.  How about that?  That would be karma.  Yeah.  What kind of karma do you have that you know a program makes fun of dead children and you  keep tuning it in for the occasional chuckle?  That's true.  You fucking soulless shithead.  Put on Laugh USA or a Bill Cosby CD and listen to that and drunk drive into a wall.  Oh, sorry.  What's funny about drunk driving?  Nothing.  Didn't mean to make fun of that.  Sorry about that.  Creep. 
[02:19:00]  It's a mess.  Enough people go away from this program.  Guess what?  We go away.  There you go.  And that'll be our karma.  Right.  So exercise your power as a consumer.  But until that point, I think we know and do a good job making people laugh.  Good point, Ope.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's see if time was kind to Tommy Two-Tone, Anthony.  Right.  Same song played last night.  Hey! 
[02:19:30]  So far, so good.  All right.  Sounds like the song.  Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to?  Give me something I can lose.  No.  Tough part.  I know you're the same time like the other people.  We'll start your name and number on the road. 
[02:20:00]  Hey!  Tell me I've got your number.  I need to play to my end.  Tell me I'll take your number.  Eight, six, seven, five, four, nine.  Nine, nine.  Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine, nine.  Ah!  Boy, he's gotten a lot more affected.  Yeah, who is he? 
[02:20:30]  Tom Likas?  Aye, aye, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.  Did he ever have another hit?  I don't think so.  He has to go through life as the Jenny guy, right?  He's the Jenny, Jenny guy.  Oh, man.  I think he's saying a cool song about information, but it didn't go as well because he would just  go, four, one, one.  But then a lot of people call information when they're having medical problems.  I shouldn't make fun of that.  You know, you're right, Matt Powell.  That's bad karma to make fun of information because everybody needs information.  You need information. 
[02:21:00]  That's right.  You might now call information and they're not going to answer.  They'll say no.  Thank you.  And that would be karma.  That's right.  All right.  Well, Tommy Two-Tone came back in the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  And he decided to try to sing a Blink-182 song.  All right.  I'm sure this is good.  Judging by that intro, it's got to be terrific.  Yeah.  This is brutal. 
[02:21:30]  All the small things, true care, true brains.  I take one lift, your ride, your best trip.  Always, I know, you'll be in my show.  That whole Tommy Two-Tone sound doesn't quite... 
[02:22:00]  It's like watching bad karaoke with really famous people from the old days.  The show's great.  Yeah.  It wasn't very good.  All right.  Let's move through this.  Do you remember the motels, Anthony?  Ah, yes, yes.  Only the Lonely?  Only the Lonely.  Good song. 
[02:22:30]  That's when I used to switch MTV off and change the channel and the motels come on.  We walked the loneliest mile.  We smiled without any style.  We kissed altogether wrong.  No intention.  We lied about each other's dreams.  What other song made that?  We live with our people. 
[02:23:00]  No, they had another hit.  Oh, I can't remember offhand, but the race is on.  Derek's in there punching away.  I got it.  Suddenly Last Summer.  Oh, right.  Oh, I know that one.  I know that one.  All right, so that's the motels.  You don't remember that one?  No.  Suddenly Last Summer.  It was very similar to Only the Lonely.  Yeah.  Here, give a picture of that.  Oh, suddenly.  Same song.  It's a little song by the motels. 
[02:23:30]  It's kind of like the first hit, but not exactly.  Here it is.  It's happened one time.  It's happened forever.  Stop whining.  For a short time.  All right, whatever.  That's the exact same song.  Yeah, it is.  Well, that's what happened.  We discussed this last week with these new wave bands.  They had that one big hit, and then they had a follow-up that sounded a lot like the big hit,  but had different lyrics and just slightly different.  Sounded like it laid on its side.  Yeah, exactly.  You hear Ozzy's new song. 
[02:24:00]  It's called Nutty Boat.  Ann in West Virginia.  Hello.  What's up, Ann?  Oh, they're going to run.  Hey.  Hi, Jimmy.  Huh?  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Doing pretty good.  I just called to defend you.  I'm a boatist, and I've been listening to you guys since October.  I think you guys are great.  It has nothing to do with your karma.  Thanks, Ann.  Thank you.  Thanks very much.  I'll tell you, Ann.  All right.  Well, we appreciate it.  Good ass kissing everyone.  So, that's Virginia. 
[02:24:30]  We don't even need to play the motels doing Nora Jones.  Let's try to get past this bit.  Where's Eric?  I need vanilla ice now.  Can't we hear the motels doing Nora Jones?  No, doing their...  We didn't hear them doing their hit now.  Oh, you're right.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's the whole bit.  I'm sorry, Ann.  You're right.  What are you doing?  Here's the motels doing only The Lonely last night.  I've done this a million times over the years. 
[02:25:00]  Well, we kissed all together wrong.  No intention.  She's still got it.  Yeah.  She's doing, like, plays and stuff and musicals.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's still got it. 
[02:25:30]  Not a bad version right now.  What'd she look like?  Oof.  That's a different story.  I really...  Oh, yeah.  Time's a bitch.  Oof.  Can I ask...  Who's dressing Katie Couric?  Fucking Shakespeare?  She has got the worst clothing I've ever seen.  They're just in a big panic over there at the Today Show.  Oh, she's awful. 
[02:26:00]  Because Good Morning America is nipping.  They're nipping at their heels.  She's atrocious.  All right, let's go to Ice Ice Baby.  Ooh.  Everyone remembers this fine hit from...  Who's that young go-getter?  That's Eric.  No.  On TV.  She's been doing the news for a while.  She has been?  Yeah.  All right, hit that.  Hmm? 
[02:26:30]  I don't remember it starting that way, but...  There you go.  Yo, VIP.  Oh, yeah.  Let's kick it.  Which way's north?  Yo, VIP.  Ice Ice Baby.  All right, stop.  Collaborate and listen.  Ice is back with my brand new invention.  Something grabs a hold of me tightly.  Wow.  Like a hawk from daily and nightly.  Will it ever stop?  Yo, I don't know.  Turn off the lights and I'll glow. 
[02:27:00]  Through the extreme, I rock a mic like a Vanduul.  Light up a stage and watch a chump like a candle.  Dance.  You just don't like this, Jimmy, because it reminds you of you when you were a kid.  You used to dress like freaking Vanilla Ice.  It certainly does.  It certainly does.  I was Vanilla Mush.  Hey, leave him alone.  Why don't you call up and tell me, hey, she wouldn't fuck you.  You're mushy and vanilla-ish.  You joke beef listener.  Yeah.  Who's not checking out this song when you hear it on the radio, though? 
[02:27:30]  It's one of those, I hate to use the term.  No, I would be so off of it.  It's called a guilty pleasure, Anthony.  Is this ever hip?  Bacon and bacon's a great rhyme.  Yeah.  Well, here's Vanilla Ice, last night, doing the same song.  It's hard to do rap live and make it sound like the record. 
[02:28:00]  Do you hear what he's doing?  He's so trying to have some gangster attitude.  Yeah.  It's not as clean as it was.  Right.  Like he's adding a little anger. 
[02:28:30]  More anger.  Right.  A little bit louder.  A little bit louder.  You know what time it is.  All right.  Did Should Knight come out and hang him out a hotel window?  That would have been...  To answer your question, yes, I do know what time it is.  Time to get consistent with your race again, you fucking suburban sellout.  We do have a hardcore version of Ice Ice Baby that he did a few years back. 
[02:29:00]  He was trying everything to get past this song.  He even came out with a hardcore version.  Listen to this.  We'll be right back. 
[02:29:30]  I don't mind this version.  I like it.  The words really flow.  Exactly.  Wax a chump.  Kind of get a little nine-inch-nale sound in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, because the music's all cool and it's got attitude, but the lyrics suck. 
[02:30:00]  It's very, you know, it's still the same sucky...  Ice, ice, baby!  Ice, ice, baby!  Atrocious. 
[02:30:30]  You don't like it?  That's awful.  I think it's pretty cool.  I thought that was pretty cool.  I could go with that music, but it's like there's so many...  Listen to Zombie.  Rob Zombie does stuff like that that's real, it's heavy.  Why would you listen to that when you could just listen to Rob Zombie?  Disturbed.  Exactly.  For a Disturbed album.  I'm just going with the...  Trump Like Bacon.  What?  What's going on there?  Derek has put up the gay sign.  He's dubbed it gay from the other room.  He's got like a little board.  I hate Derek's new board system.  I know.  There's a board system over there and a kid's going to look over and just read Derek's thoughts 
[02:31:00]  on things.  And he cleverly got red so you can't miss it.  Right.  That's his new bit.  Yeah.  I know it is.  He knows he doesn't like to talk on mic much, but he knows he can speak with his music selection  during our bits.  So now his opinion is gay.  And he holds up signs, so...  All right.  Well, Ice, Ice, baby.  Well, Vanilla Ice came back later on in the program and attempted Survivor from Destiny's  Child.  Why pick this song if you want to change your image?  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Just send me two, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  This stinks. 
[02:32:00]  Awful.  This is really bad.  All right.  How do you...  I understand Snoop is trying to recapture some street cred, so he's going to be on next  week singing like a virgin.  Could you have picked a faggier song, you idiots?  How about like a good Eminem song?  If you want to do something that's hard, you probably couldn't do the lyrics right.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he do that?  Destiny's Child.  Do they tell him to do these songs or something? 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  That would have been the way to go.  I would have loved to have seen Vanilla Ice try to do some Eminem.  Eminem or a 50 Cent song to In the Club.  Yeah.  I would have loved to have seen that.  You're right.  I say In the Club, not In the Club like Fitty would have said it when we were sitting together  in the plane.  This show is just...  I don't know.  There's something about it, though.  It's addicting.  It's getting huge ratings.  It's a car wreck.  It is a car wreck.  Okay.  Before we go to break, Anthony, we're getting a lot of requests for the Henry Hill, Bob Kelly  remix.  Oh, wait.  On Instant Feedback, having some kind of consistency with your race, said the man with the pink 
[02:33:00]  Kango hat.  Oh, dude.  Please.  I completely...  Of course I know that.  I...  This is what people got to understand.  We were talking about this on the way out.  As far as throwing people under the bus, no one is faster to swan dive under a bus than  I am.  I fucking live under one.  Yeah.  I have tire tracks all over my fat tits and appendix scar.  I understand that I shit on myself as well as other people.  I understand I wore a pink Kango and it was red.  The pink would have been faggy and kind of sellout-ish.  Yeah.  Red just kind of said I was down, y'all. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  You were ghetto.  Ugh.  And embarrassing nothing.  And you let people...  Fat laces.  You let people shit on you as well, so...  Who doesn't?  Yeah.  What am I going to do?  Be rude?  So we get a lot of requests as we go to break the Henry Hill, Bob Kelly remix.  This bit is just about at the end of its shelf life, I believe.  End of its life.  Also, though, I want to play the Star Trek one really fast.  Oh, yeah.  We only played this once and I think, first of all, we don't know who did it.  I don't have the credit for this one, but I thought it was a really good job.  No?  I thought it was fun, especially if you're a Star Trek fan. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, that was Pete.  Shut up.  No idea.  Bob Kelly's coming in next week, by the way, while you're in L.A. doing Jay Leno.  Oh, cool.  I think Kelly's coming in Monday.  Oh, good.  And he'll sit in that very seat.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand, man.  Make sure Bob doesn't do this.  This is what this asshole does.  Bob is such a fucking dumbbell.  He'll rehearse things.  And then you go to his apartment and sit down.  And he'll be like, you know, dude.  And he kind of looks off in his face and he'll talk about something.  And I caught him one time.  I'm like, you fucking rehearse this shit. 
[02:34:30]  Thought it out.  And wait until you have an audience, you bore.  So you think he's putting some things together and rehearsing them and then he'll come on  the show?  He will because he wants to sound smart.  And no matter what it is, dude, you know, the money situation in this country.  And it's like, if you do anything to throw him off, like if you go, he's just got to  start over.  Get him off script.  We'll do that one day.  Like the telemarketer.  Oh, you'll notice that idiot.  He'll just kind of, wherever he looks over your head when he's talking, he's just remembering  how he said it when he was alone talking to the dogs.  That's funny.  Oh, Bob is an ass. 
[02:35:00]  All right, so here's the Bob Kelly Star Trek remix first.  From the maker of the Robert Kelly Homer Simpson remix, the mix that Steve sees it was fucking  terrible, but everybody else loved, comes into a mix with high hopes of wounding Steve's  approval and perhaps a four star rating.  Todd from Framingham Studios presents the Robert Kelly Star Trek remix.  Captain's log, stardate 4523.3. 
[02:35:30]  Deep Space Station K7 has issued a Priority One call.  We're going in armed for battle.  It is not life as we know or understand it.  Hold my hand, man.  Don't be afraid.  Use my hand.  There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. 
[02:36:00]  I'm sorry, Mr. Spock.  But I'm afraid the creature must die.  I see no alternative myself, Captain.  It very seems a pity.  Set your faces on Force 3 to kill.  What the fuck?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Not bad, right?  I find it kind of funny.  This next one blows it away, though.  Yeah, well, you always play the one that's not as good first.  You're right.  Here's, uh, I think this one, uh, was the best one that came in, Ant? 
[02:36:30]  What'd you say?  From Harry T?  Which one is that, though?  I have no, I don't remember.  Henry Hill?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I think this one blew all the other ones away.  Yeah, I like it.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car. 
[02:37:00]  What do you want, fucko?  You want something, huh?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.  Oh, my hand, man.  I've got to squeeze something.  Ah, fuck.  Down.  Way down. 
[02:37:30]  Keep going.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I got to squeeze something. 
[02:38:00]  On the side.  I broke my knee, man.  Shit.  It bent back.  Did it hyperextend?  Oh, my God.  It bent back.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:38:30]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Water.  You want some water?  Ow.  I got to squeeze something.  Ah.  Anybody have something like Advil?  Ah, motherfucker.  Whoa.  Advil.  Ah.  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Ah, you motherfucker.  Ah.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Ah.  Ah, it's fucked up.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  You mother.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah, what the fuck?  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  I got to squeeze something.  Dude, I got more.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  I got to squeeze something.  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it. 
[02:39:30]  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man.  Ah.  Ah.  I broke my leg.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  I broke my leg, man. 
[02:40:00]  I got so much pain, dude.  I got so much pain.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  What if he is in two different people?  How the hell is he Wolverine and that fag on Broadway? 
[02:40:30]  He shaves off the beard, he takes the blades out of his knuckles,  and he tucks down that ear hair thing he does,  and all of a sudden he's a song and dance man.  What do you know?  Have you seen clips of him?  Who is he?  Peter Allen.  That's who he's playing?  The gay guy Peter Allen.  It's his life story on Broadway, and Hugh Jackman is playing him a year ago.  And he does,  Win my baby, win my baby.  Rio, Rio, De Janeiro.  No?  Nothing?  He's the last man on broadcast there. 
[02:41:00]  Did he?  Sure he did.  Look, I just know because it's Hugh Jackman,  and I'm a big X-Men fan,  and, you know, he's Wolverine.  Is that how you know?  And that's how I know.  Where?  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.  That big gloved hand is pointing at you so it doesn't get your blood on it. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  Better keep Anthony happy today.  Oh.  This could be the gayest song ever.  Really long intro.  Is it?  How do you know?  Bagot.  I saw the show.  Oh, you did?  Did you really?  I did.  How was it?  It was good.  Do you have to bring a dildo to put on the seat,  or do they leave one there in the theater for you?  Awful.  This is when the whole chorus line shuffles out,  and there are tattered robes and slippers. 
[02:42:00]  A little dog yelping behind them.  Does the dog smell that something is wrong,  because they're not being fed as often?  I'd love to feed you,  but I'm just too tired to get out of bed.  And then there's a whole other group of people.  They come out on stage dressed as big T's,  and then they slowly leave the stage,  so there's only one left.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Whoopi and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.

[02:43:00]  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know you need you on this side.  I know you know you don't know.  Ah, this could be interesting.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  You're just tuning into the program.  The Daily News did a huge, huge article on our assault on the media thing, Anthony.  You can read it for yourself. 
[02:43:30]  We linked the article on opianthony.com.  But just getting major, major exposure in the Daily News today.  A column written by Richard Huff.  You might want to listen to the replay if you're just tuning in to hear the article and our comments about it.  It sounded like Richard wasn't a big fan of what we were doing to get the exposure out there for the Opie and Anthony Show.  Not at all, but he's brave enough to come on the air with us.  That's good.  What happened?  It's on Foundry.  Oh, it's on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com, the article. 
[02:44:00]  So let's say hi to Richard Huff from the Daily News.  Mr. Huff?  Yeah.  How are you, buddy?  Good, thanks.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Jim Norton.  Hey, guys.  First of all, I want to thank you for the major exposure today.  Even though you didn't want to do it, we read the article and I see there's one part where you say, you know,  I know what this is going to do and it's doing exactly what they want, giving them exposure.  That is indeed what we're doing this for, is to get exposure for the show, get the name out there.  And it does seem to be working. 
[02:44:30]  You've got to agree with that.  Hey, I'm here for you.  I've got to ask you a question.  It just seems that the media, the way that you guys have covered this one, it seems like  there's a real personal anger over the fact that Arthur Cheyenne, who obviously is a media  person, was victimized or it seems like we get a lot from the media, you guys caused him  to be fired.  It seems like that's the general consensus from the media.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't say that, at least from my aspect here.  Look, he did something he shouldn't have done on the air.  There's no doubt about that.  I think what you're seeing from some extent, and I can see it from some of the letters 
[02:45:00]  I've gotten since he got canned, is that people think maybe the penalty on CBS's part  might have been a little too bad.  Yeah, we even agree with that.  That's ridiculous.  You know, the guy lost it, but to be fired now because of this zero tolerance policy that's  out there is ridiculous.  Well, and so I think that's where some of the anger is.  Look, I'm not sitting here to defend him dropping the F-bomb like that.  I mean, that was just wrong, and he didn't deal with it appropriately. 
[02:45:30]  So, no, I'm not angry about that.  Now, let's dispose of the love fest here.  Obviously, you have a problem with what we're doing.  Well, you know what it is?  It's like, imagine you're sitting at your desk, and somebody walks up behind you and  starts making faces or doing something, and you can't do anything about it.  I don't agree with that, though.  We've heard that example being used before.  And if you put your desk out on the street and decided to now work out in the public and 
[02:46:00]  somebody did that, you would have to expect it and deal with it professionally.  That's what these reporters are doing.  They're taking their job out on the public streets where behind them is fair game, and  it has been for years.  People have just randomly dropped by, made faces, shout-outs.  I've seen gang signs thrown up when they do stories from Compton and whatnot.  And this, we figured, is a great area for an Opie and Anthony billboard, if you will,  a sign to pop up behind us. 
[02:46:30]  We've asked people not to interfere with the reporter or touch the reporter in any way.  But to have that opening there in public territory, I see no problem with it.  And I can't see how people get upset with it when, you know, they're opening that up to us.  Well, I mean, you do have a point there.  There's no doubt about it.  Now, in many of these cases, though, they do go out of their way to make sure there's not something behind them.  I mean, Pat Battle was standing on a beach with nothing behind her on an empty beach,  and your guy comes running up. 
[02:47:00]  You know what, Richard?  You've got to admit, did you see the video?  I did.  You've got to admit, it's kind of funny when you see the guy starting to run from behind her,  way in the distance and getting closer and closer.  Or look at the one with Marcus Solis.  You had these two folks come up out of the subway.  Yeah, they're coming out like troll people out of the ground.  And you were right in the fact that, I mean, how many times have you watched a newscast  and there's some goofball in the back on a cell phone waving,  trying to, you know, get his girlfriend on the line before the... 
[02:47:30]  We've just taken that to the next level, that's all.  But, Richard, the question I have, like, this is one of the problems I have.  Not that you guys shouldn't cover it or talk about it or even editorial on it.  Oh, my God, cover it all you want.  Absolutely.  You got exactly what you wanted.  But the attitude coming from the media about it is a bit self-righteous.  When you look at it, you say, like, how would you feel if you were doing your job  and were interfered with it?  Well, how many people are doing their jobs and are interfered with by the press  trying to grab a story?  And I'm not talking about legitimate interference.  How many times have there been crime victims  where reporters are sticking their microphone in the face just to get the scoop? 
[02:48:00]  It's like reporters can be pretty...  Intrusive.  Yeah.  And pretty vulture-ish when it comes to getting stories.  And yet here we are doing our jobs trying to get press and doing this.  And we're being vilified in a weird way, like being called jerks, which is fine.  I mean, you know, we are jerks.  I didn't call you jerks.  I called the people who are doing it jerks.  But I'm going to say, even the New York Times said...  There are jerks, Richard.  We are, too.  But it's like, even the New York Times said opie and dopey.  And yet when they talk about Al Zarqawi or Bin Laden, it's Mr. Bin Laden or Mr. 
[02:48:30]  Why is this...  Why is it that people feel free to editorialize here and not on real things?  Like on Jason Blair, were people calling him liar or scumbag when they were writing about him?  Or were they just calling him disgraced reporter?  Well, I think it depends on the publication you're working with, too.  I mean, you know, look, the Times is not going to take that kind of attitude with anything they write.  They did.  No, what I'm saying is, you know, generally speaking, I write a column.  I mean, you're reading a column that's opinion.  Right.  You know, in the same section, we have regular, straight, hopefully, objective stories. 
[02:49:00]  You know, I'm not sure about the story that you're talking about, the one in the Times.  I didn't see that one.  I know there was a column or something that they wrote.  I'm not going to defend them.  You know, you're right.  There are some aspects of the media where it is intrusive and it does become a problem.  Yeah, I don't have much respect for what these guys do, to be honest with you.  What guys?  The reporters, you know, the fear-mongering they love to do.  I don't have much respect for their jobs. 
[02:49:30]  Well, you know what?  I mean, it's not all that.  It's become a lot more entertainment-based than it has actually giving you the proper and accurate information.  When I watch the news, what I see is an entertainment show.  I see them battling each other for viewers and using, you know, clever graphics, teasers, even live locations.  They promote where they're going to be, bands that they're getting on these morning shows. 
[02:50:00]  It's all entertainment-based now, and to have this attitude where we can do this, but the second we're interfered with,  now you're interfering with our journalism, you know, and our credibility as journalists.  I don't buy it.  Well, you guys are old enough to remember the times where we were all sitting around saying,  oh, this is the MTV-ization of the media.  I mean, you've seen that go even further now with everything else out there.  I mean, look, lots of folks tuned to Entertainment Tonight for their news.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  And that's what a lot of people are competing with.  Look at what's going on with the CBS Evening News.  They've talked about multiple anchors and different approaches.  Do you think people would watch a news program like it was when it was a desk, a guy, and a clock, and a microphone, you know?  Like in the older days where you knew you were pretty much getting accurate information.  It wasn't about flash and teases and entertainment.  It was just about news.  Do you think people would watch that?  You know, that's a good question.  Again, it becomes an age issue here because there's a sense that the younger folks aren't watching it that way. 
[02:51:00]  They're getting their news on the Internet.  They're scanning the headlines.  I mean, it's hard these days not to get your news in some fashion.  You know, you turn your computer on.  Your home page already tells you who won the game, even if you didn't know.  Right.  So that's what these folks are facing.  A straight-ahead newscast like we used to have, low graphics, just a guy sitting in a suit?  Probably not.  Probably not.  It's like you watch Network with Peter Finch. 
[02:51:30]  It was almost prophetic at the way things are being done now to get viewers.  It's going farther and farther.  And, again, we understand that, but it's like the media does at times take a holier-than-thou attitude when it is about getting viewers.  It is about competing with the other networks, just like any other entertainment venue.  But that doesn't diminish what you hope is the quality of the journalism.  The things they do to get you to the show may be a little different these days.  And, you know, you mentioned the concerts. 
[02:52:00]  Obviously, over a two-hour or three-hour morning breakfast show, you can have those sorts of elements.  You have a half-hour evening newscast.  You're not going to have a concert.  Well, Richard, are you sure that it doesn't compromise the integrity, though?  When you're rushing to get the story first, maybe you don't fact-check as much.  Maybe you're not as concerned with getting it right as opposed to getting it first.  I think that does kind of interfere with, like, what's being reported accurately.  Well, you know, that's an issue.  There's no doubt about it.  You know, and you're seeing more situations now where folks are taking the easy way out and just copying somebody else's column, which is amazing in this electronic era. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, turn on the computer any day, and you'll see another story of a journalist in Podunk who, you know, copied something from somebody else.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  But I think, you know, a majority of the journalists hopefully get the story correct.  You're going to make mistakes.  There are days where, you know, you don't make the extra call, or you do and you get the wrong information. 
[02:53:00]  Well, obviously, we're doing this, this assault on the media, to get attention, to get the name out there.  But the little side thing that I think we're enjoying also is giving it back to the media a little bit and, you know, saying, hey, you guys are taking yourself pretty seriously, and we think that's a little hypocritical.  And, yeah, here we are, right behind you.  In your column, you mentioned Stern fans calling shows. 
[02:53:30]  And, again, my comments on that, I actually thought those calls were really funny, so I'm not judging those calls because they made me laugh.  But you make it look like those were kind of smarter things to do.  And I point out the 93 Trade Center bombing, the Colin Ferguson massacre, Oklahoma City bombing.  These are all shows that they called on.  I think it was the LL or whatever it was, whatever the air shooting was in L.A.  Right.  I mean, you name it.  Now, to that point, and obviously that was just one paragraph in this whole thing, is that, you know, in that sense, the idea there was coming to what you said a minute ago about not checking something. 
[02:54:00]  I mean, that shows how easy it is for folks to just get on.  The difference here is you're disrupting somebody doing what they're doing.  And that is, too.  Yeah, that's what Howard Stern fans have been doing as well.  You know, they're not trying to make a point whatsoever.  I don't think their motivation is really to expose the news for, you know.  And I think you know, I think you know that.  They're not trying to expose the news.  They are allowed on, and by proxy of being allowed on, they are exposing the news just by the fact that they got through. 
[02:54:30]  But their goal is to get a laugh and to get Howard's name out there.  And I don't mind you mentioning that because I thought those calls were funny.  But to use it kind of and say, well, these guys are right, and this is Opie and Anthony, the fans are naughty, is kind of like, I don't know, I just felt it was a bit disingenuous.  Naughty.  Watch the language.  I know, I didn't mean to get too slow.  We can swear here, can't we?  You know what I'm saying, though.  I felt it was a bad comparison to make to say that these were right.  I don't feel it's accurate.  I mean, how can you say that that's accurate when those examples are raised?  Nope.  But we disagree.  And who is Charles James? 
[02:55:00]  Right.  Reader Charles James.  Reader Charles James.  Where did you get that quote from, Richard?  Come on, who is he?  We make that up.  We've got a whole style here.  Do you really think Howard's fans were doing that just to make a mockery of the media?  Do you really think they were doing that to make a social point or to get laughs?  I think that is, in fact, the point.  Clearly now there are people who just want to be like him, who do it just to do it.  But I believe that they initially started that way. 
[02:55:30]  So why would they yell his name instead of doing something else that was socially relevant  if it wasn't to get his name out there?  Well, because then it doesn't get mentioned.  I want to be liked by Howard, so I'm going to mention his name, just like your folks mention your names.  Right.  So why are you painting it in a different light like it was done to expose the media and make a social point?  It's almost like you're giving it a certain legitimacy.  Credibility, right.  A credibility that you won't give this.  And again, I think those calls are very funny, so I'm not judging them on a certain level.  I think it's an equal basis.  I think we're doing exactly the same thing. 
[02:56:00]  It's trying to get the name out there.  Of course.  And using the media to do it.  And I don't see any difference between them.  And what's more interfering with a job, actually interrupting a newscast under a false pretense  and getting airtime or just holding up a dumb sign?  I mean, what is really costing more airtime?  Well, I mean, you're doing the same, aren't you?  I mean, when folks can't come back to a live shot because your people are standing behind them.  That's funny.  Hey, you know something?  They could come back.  Sure they can.  That sign will be back there, but the report is not going to be interfered with. 
[02:56:30]  If they're a professional, they can plow through it and finish their story.  Absolutely.  But if you have a phony fire chief telling Howard Stern, you can't get the real Howard  chief on there.  Phony fire chief.  Or the real fire chief.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, no, that's true.  Now, what happened to your guy at the beach?  He wasn't there when she came back.  He wasn't our guy.  He was just some, yeah, listen.  And by the way, Richard, our fans are pests and we don't like them either.  And we think they're jerks.  They're very, very bad people.  But they're very loyal and they'll do anything for us. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, you just made this situation a lot worse.  Yeah.  A lot worse.  You called them weasels in your article.  They're pests.  Weasels.  Hey, Richard, why didn't you call us?  We would have gave you a few quotes.  I didn't know where to get you.  Oh, really?  Come on.  We're well hidden.  But you understand what I'm saying?  It's like whenever, I raised this example this morning when Wayne Williams was being accused  of murdering children.  They couldn't wait to hear what he said.  And yet, in this case, nobody wants to call and find out what our side of the story is  or what the show's side of the story is.  And I just can't quite get that.  That's usually the way, whenever a story wraps itself around this program, we rarely get 
[02:57:30]  calls to get our side of it.  It's usually a lot easier to just throw the story together with speculation and punch the  story up a little bit.  Well, look, I think, and you guys have dealt with David Hinckley, our radio reporter, before.  We do reach out in those situations.  I mean, this is a column talking about what people are seeing on TV, you know, in my opinion.  So I don't, you know, I don't, what would you have added to it?  Which, you know, I don't, I guess I'll do it. 
[02:58:00]  I like Tube Talk, by the way.  I think you do a good job with it.  I really do.  Richard Huff.  And by the way, I'm getting a lot of letters from folks who agree with you.  Uh-oh.  Yes, they're out there.  Oh, yeah.  Once again, the pests.  Were they calling you Dick Huff?  That hasn't happened yet, but I'm sure now that you're mentioning it.  Well, we called him Dick Breath.  Yeah, we kind of, we were a little angry this morning.  We were cranky this morning.  We might have called you Dick Huff and Dick Breath or something equally as offensive. 
[02:58:30]  You know, you seem like a pretty cool guy, and it's nice to have a guy that actually does,  you know, come on the air with us.  At least you came on the air.  Yeah, most people just run away and hide behind their article.  There was a huge AP story about us that, oh, about the Arthur Chien, and the AP writer  said that we were celebrating the fact that he got fired.  Yeah, it said right now Opie and Anthony are celebrating his firing, and I was in Colorado  at the time, and I was playing golf.  And I was in Florida at a graduation.  I'm like, I'm celebrating this guy's firing? 
[02:59:00]  Where did this guy get this information?  How does he print this when I didn't even speak to this guy?  Right.  Unbelievable.  If you want to talk, you should go over some articles.  Read that Times article and watch how incestuous a lot of the reporting is, and it's very subtle,  but people in the media are very angry that one of their own got caught out there, and  you don't see this kind of defensive reporting or these type of defensive phrasing using  in a lot of cases, but they're really getting very defensive and upset because one of their  own was fired.  Yeah, again, as we started here, I mean, I think that he just messed up there. 
[02:59:30]  That was, you know, not handling the situation, and it's interesting if you look at the comment  from Channel 2 in that piece I wrote today, that, you know, our reporters are professionally  trained in this sort of stuff, except the one we got rid of.  Except the one we fired.  But it is interesting the response that has come back just on Arthur's, you know, firing  from folks throughout the city concerned about that.  Well, we agree that he shouldn't have been fired.  We thought what he did was, you know, a little dumb and he should have thought more, but they  never should have fired him for it.  But just the way they were, like the Times said, Arthur Cheyenne acted human, and they're 
[03:00:00]  all saying he was so provoked, which is true, but you don't see them ever reporting other  things that way.  Why is the tone so defensive?  Because it's one of their own.  Yeah.  Good question.  I wish I had an answer for you.  All right, Richard, before we let you go, the one TV show we all should be watching.  Oh, good question.  We like that Hit Me Baby One More Time show that's on Thursday nights on NBC.  Lots of talk about that one.  It's amazing how well the dancing show is doing. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah, that goddamn dancing show.  It's like, is it just, is it ballroom or all kinds of dancing?  Ballroom.  It's ballroom dancing with celebrities doing it.  What?  They got like the guy that played Peterman from Seinfeld.  Yeah, he's in it.  Evander Holyfield.  Evander Holyfield.  Joey McIntyre.  Heather Mills.  No.  Hey, Richard Laft, though.  Oh, damn, Jimmy.  Richard Laft.  Watch Rescue Me when that comes back.  Yeah, well, that had a great first season. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, with Dennis Leary.  Yeah, a couple weeks.  Wait, what's this dancing show, though?  So then what happens?  They dance.  It's almost like an American Idol of dancing with celebrities.  Exactly.  They got the three, you know, American Idol wannabe judges with all the stereotypical  characters we have now for judges, and they dance, and then, you know, the judges vote  and the viewers vote, which is pretty amazing, because in the first episode, Kelly Monaco,  who's on one of the soaps, was terrible.  I mean, terrible.  Yeah.  Like me, ballroom dancing.  And they got the lowest marks, and then they voted Trista Rain off, or Trista Sutter now, 
[03:01:30]  you know, who's on The Bachelorette.  But, so that's kind of a fun show for goofy reasons.  Hit me, baby, one more time.  Lots of folks are talking about it.  Yeah, nostalgia is so in, you know.  It's like anything 80s is really huge.  Yeah, but I don't think it's nostalgia in the sense of appreciating this.  I think it's a lot.  No, it's making fun of it.  You know, a lot of those shows, like We Love the 80s and things like that, it's about making 
[03:02:00]  fun of it and going, ew.  You know, I kind of remember that, and it was awful then.  Yeah, exactly.  Why do people like looking back at things that were awful?  Well, you know, it's looking back and saying, wow, look at how fat that guy got.  You know, I mean, that's what half of the audience...  That's what we've been doing.  Making yourself feel better.  Just knocking other people down.  Yeah, perfect.  We like to call it time is a bitch, Richard.  Yeah.  We play the original version of the song, and then how they, you know, sang it last night,  and it's very interesting, the contrast.  Yeah, oh, no doubt about it. 
[03:02:30]  No doubt about it.  But that's doing pretty well.  Richard, I've got to thank you for coming on the show.  That's pretty cool.  Anytime.  And thank you for exposing this to a lot more people for us.  You see, you didn't even have to buy an ad.  Yeah, you could do a follow-up and say you spoke to us, and we said this will continue.  Thanks very much.  All right, Richard.  Take care, guys.  See you.  Bye.  Richard Huff from the Daily News.  Look at that.  At least he came on the air, man.  Most of these reporters never would, but he was fine with it.  It's amazing how people go from hated douchebag in the morning, and then a couple hours later, 
[03:03:00]  he's a cool guy.  I never really hated him.  He played right into our hands, and I was happy about that.  Yeah, but I'll bet he's going, all right, I thought those guys were going to be complete  scumbags.  He's like, whew.  How hard it is not to be a scumbag, just so they can't say that we would be complete  scumbags, and they expected that?  We love throwing people off.  I know.  But he was honest.  I mean, he didn't.  He bullshitted.  I just, you know, I don't feel bad about what I said this morning.  I was very upset.  Mm-hmm.  A little not happy.  Didn't have your coffee yet.  Good point, Ant.  A little cranky. 
[03:03:30]  You'll love Paisano.  Paisano's.  It's Paisano's Restaurant.  I was going to go to Paisano last night.  I was in the mood for some Italian food, and when I want my Italian food, I go down to  Joey's Place on Mulberry Street, Paisano, Anthony.  But I got to tell you, it was like 98 degrees.  I wasn't going into the subway or taking a cab yesterday.  No, huh?  And I was kind of bummed, because then I went to a little local joint, and...  Not good, right?  No.  Kind of bummed that I didn't make the trek down to Mulberry Street to Paisano. 
[03:04:00]  You know what the great thing about Paisano of Mulberry Street is?  When the weather gets nice like this.  Outdoor dining.  I love outdoor dining.  The table outside.  It's nice.  You know, you try it early in the season, and the wind is blowing.  It's a little cold.  You're out there.  Hey, we're outside.  You got nice days, though?  Dude, I figured it out.  You know, I mean, we get off the air at 11.  It's been 90 all week.  I'm thinking, eh, time to do a little girl watching, you know?  So I go to Central Park, right? 
[03:04:30]  Hang out with a book.  My MiFi.  I'm all set.  Yeah.  Sit and check out the girls as they're doing their tanning thing.  Eh, eh.  What?  Because they wear the bathing suits and everything's covered nice.  You get a freaking table on a sidewalk.  Yeah.  Women are not wearing bras anymore.  No.  And the material's much lighter, and you can see through.  And occasionally you get the buttons opened up a little on the top.  It's so much better than going to the beach or a park.  I'm telling you.  Anyway, what that has to do with Paisano, I don't know. 
[03:05:00]  Well, they got, you know, you got the tables outside.  So you could grab a table outside and enjoy the...  Oh, yeah.  And then see the girls without the bras.  Dine al fresco.  Yeah.  Huge portions of Paisano.  Classic handle at restaurant.  Perfect for the late night date.  Romantic meal.  Every single pasta on the menu.  Now under $10.  And if Paisano mentioned O&A or XM Radio, you get that glass of wine on the house.  Or Ben's Big Hog.  Ben's Big Hog is the code word.  Go down to Paisano and say, psst, Ben's Big Hog, and you'll get a glass of wine. 
[03:05:30]  A big sausage sticking out of it.  Authentic Italian cuisine.  It's made from the original Old World Italian recipes.  Great place.  We love it.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Hold on, Anthony.  Yes.  Eric's parents are in town from Florida, and he went to Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Ah!  They loved it.  Did they?  Yes.  Fried ravioli.  Gotta love the fried ravioli appetizer.  And then you get that stuffed chop.  That stuffed veal chop.  It's huge.  You're gonna love it.  Are your parents gonna stop in today, or are they back in the hotel room sick and not 
[03:06:00]  able to get up?  Or be off of the apartment?  Jesus.  Are you crazy?  Are you nuts?  Just kidding.  We're talking about Joey?  Yeah.  Joey.  They're probably just sick with despair because they couldn't have more.  There you go.  Very nice.  Open weekends till 2.  Paisano of Mulberry Street, right in the heart of Little Italy.  Call them.  212-965-1188.  965-1188.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Very nice.  We can continue with the program. 
[03:06:30]  I gotta tinkle.  You do have to tinkle?  I can go while you guys continue.  I'll be back in a minute.  I see Pepper from COC, so maybe we should just regroup and have him come in.  He was fun on the phone.  He's in town.  I don't know what COC's doing.  I'm sure they have a show somewhere.  We'll find out about it.  Corrosion of Conformity, obviously.  Yeah.  All right.  When we get back, we got Katie Holmes on Letterman.  That whole saga continues.  Then we got the top dads of all time.  Top TV dads.  We got some sexy estate clips, Anthony.  Oh.  Yuck.  And there was something else. 
[03:07:00]  Yuck.  There was something else.  Oh, looking at the list.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was like...  Oh!  We gotta talk about Aruba.  The missing chick?  Well, no.  The fact that all the other islands are starting to advertise very heavily on local TV.  Yeah.  Taking advantage of Aruba's misstep there.  Kicking the little island while it's down.  We mentioned this, I guess, last week.  We're like, you watch.  All the other islands are gonna come to the table, advertise like crazy. 
[03:07:30]  They pretty much want to say, come to our island, we won't kill you.  You won't get killed here, man.  Right.  Come to Karachi.  Even though these other islands are a hell of a lot worse than Aruba.  They've always said Aruba's one of the safest places to go.  But these other islands jumping right aboard.  You watch.  Watch on your local TV.  They're all advertising now.  But they say she had met this guy like two days ago.  She was a slut.  Oh, no, Ant.  Come on.  What kind of karma is that?  I mean, I understand it's awful.  No one deserves to be murdered, which obviously she was. 
[03:08:00]  Please, they're gonna find her.  Yeah, sure.  Obviously, no one deserves to be murdered.  But, Jesus Christ, you gotta look out.  Again, with my paranoia.  I know people are like, it's paranoid Anthony.  What is she, insane?  Running off at some local yokel from Aruba?  Aruba, I understand that they met in a bar a couple days ago.  So, she might have kind of known him.  They were signing a little bit, talking.  And that very well may have been.  I think that she might have felt like. 
[03:08:30]  What?  They were talking.  She might have felt like she knew him a little bit.  And that she could trust him.  Jesus.  And he wouldn't throw her down like luggage and jump on him.  All right.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What?  Oh, the Aruba story.  Well, Aruba's number one priority is figuring this out.  They're arresting people like crazy.  Of course.  And Aruba's laws, a little different than we got here.  You know, the criminals here really should just shut up and stop their whining. 
[03:09:00]  Because what goes on in these other little countries like that, they're under some kind  of Dutch law, I believe.  And they could arrest somebody and hold them for four months with absolutely no charges.  With no charges filed against them at all.  Four months while we figure it out.  They could just lock people up and leave them in there.  And they want to get this fixed up because I guess they're losing probably a lot of money  in tourism.  Well, that's why all the other islands coming aboard and advertising.  Yep.  They see dollars out there that they could get. 
[03:09:30]  Although Aruba right now is probably the safest place to go.  Yeah.  Cops all over there.  You have a blonde head of hair where they probably guard you carefully.  Yeah, they probably do.  Don't want another one.  Don't want another one dropping off.  No matter who you are, dye that hair blonde.  It's so true.  It's like the tsunami thing, man.  They hose down those beaches so fast they got tourism back.  You know what they got to do?  They got to build a big fence.  Like a big wall with a big giant gate like in King Kong. 
[03:10:00]  And that way the tourists can be away from the, you know, what was in the movie?  The savages that were in the movie.  You know?  Sometimes they could come beating at the door or, you know, Kong will come over and bang  on the door.  But you don't let them in.  That way you can bathe.  Yeah, turn off the lights when you're done.  In the water.  Well, I'm curious as to how they get that stupid wall built with Kong running around there.  What, was he on vacation?  Yeah, I know, right?  Kong back in two weeks. 
[03:10:30]  They must have given him quite a few sacrifices, sacrificial women, to occupy his time while they  build that wall.  Why didn't dumb Kong just kick it over before it was finished?  He waits until they're all done and it's cemented.  Then he knocks.  Cemented.  Kong is an ass.  I don't think they're out there with trowels and bricks.  Ding dong.  Hello.  Ringing the bell.  It's made out of wood.  Oh.  Yeah.  No cement.  We're savages.  We're going to get Pepper Keenan in here next.  All righty.  Ben's giving the break sign.  Good job getting that Richard Huff, Ben. 
[03:11:00]  Excellent.  He's all right.  It was a good interview, right?  It certainly was.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony Laboratory.  Mmm.  Ah.  Mmm.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, baby.  Hey, guys.  Anyone want a bagel?  No!  No!  Stop ruining the show, Eric.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Feel the love.  Yeah, right on, man. 
[03:11:30]  Let's get the guys in here. 
[03:12:00]  That's Corrosion of Conformity, Anthony, the single stonebreaker from their new CD, In  the Arms of God.  We got Pepper and Woody.  Oh, man.  You guys are eating chocolate strawberries.  What up, man?  I remember you, too, man.  We go way back with these guys.  Right.  Familiar faces.  I remember you, dude.  We used to work at a radio station called WAAF.  Yeah.  The only station that really rocks.  That's right.  We were rocking.  We were rocking, and COC used to do some shows for us.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  We're talking like 10 years ago. 
[03:12:30]  We're still doing shows.  Yeah.  You're still kicking ass.  You're playing Irving Plaza tonight, I think, here in New York City?  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  And then Philly tomorrow at the, what?  Trocadero.  Trocadero.  Very good.  Whose chocolate-covered strawberry is this?  It's yours if you want it.  I'm going to tell.  I'm not going to tell anybody I saw y'all eating these things.  It's Godiva.  It's good.  Godiva chocolate.  It's from the 50-year-old virgin outside.  We should bring her in.  50-year-old virgin?  Yeah.  Patty.  I swear to God, man.  Do something about that.  We've been trying. 
[03:13:00]  We've been trying for like eight years now.  What, did she come all the time and see you?  Yeah.  She's like, she started, we call her Stalker Patty.  No, she was a real stalker.  Stalker.  And we figured, eh.  Is that her?  Yeah.  I swear to God, she used to stalk us and finally, like, most people would call the police and  get detectives involved.  We're like, ah.  Invite her in.  You guys invited her in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She used to sleep under the stairs at our old joint.  I'm sorry, I'm going to have to kill you.  She was homeless, too.  Look at those William Frawley pants.  She's in here.  Patty, your shorts are pulled up so high, you look like William Frawley. 
[03:13:30]  Is that a bathing suit you got underneath it, too?  She might be going swimming, man.  It's not, it's a shirt.  It's a shirt?  Yeah, I bought it this week.  Pepper, this is the real deal.  Patty, do you know anything about corrosion of conformity?  No, but she was asking a lot of questions and she was making me nervous outside.  Yeah, she does that.  What was she saying?  All I said was, hi, I'm Patty.  What do you do?  Yeah, that's all it takes to creep people out, Patty.  Yeah, I've heard that before.  That's all it takes to creep people out.  Yeah, I thought it would be a little deeper questions than that, Pepper. 
[03:14:00]  Jesus.  Well, Patty is 50 years old.  She just turned 50, what, a couple of days ago?  Happy birthday.  Yeah, happy birthday, Patty.  And she is indeed a virgin.  She grew up in some strict Catholic background and it fucked her up.  She's a family.  Yeah, she was abandoned as an infant in a diner because her mother couldn't take care of her,  because her stockbroker father had sex with what we believe was a prostitute, which was her mother, 
[03:14:30]  and got pregnant and she dropped the baby off at a diner and then took her to this foundling center.  What is a foundling center?  Sounds like, I don't know, I thought, you know, it sounds like something from the 1800s, the foundling center.  Is it in Manhattan?  Like an orphanage, right?  A foundling.  It's the New York foundling hospital.  They have a special unit for kids that are, you know, adopted or foster kids.  Right.  And you were just kind of abandoned, so they put you there for a while until they found a foster family for you. 
[03:15:00]  I was raised by wolves.  Yeah.  You would have been better off.  At least you wouldn't be afraid of sex, as bad as this woman is.  I hope you guys aren't disappointed that we're not going to do the regular freaking interview here.  Right.  We're talking about some fondling center.  You know something?  That's probably what it turns out to be.  That's right.  That's probably the joke running around the place.  I was raised in a fondling center.  Fondling center.  There's a step body, just walk through and look for the biggest tits.  All right, I'll take her.  You know, we've been talking about the foundling society for years, and we never went down that road. 
[03:15:30]  It's the fondling center.  That's the obvious joke.  So she was adopted by an older couple.  Way older.  Or not adopted.  You were the foster.  They were in their 60s.  They were in their 60s and had to raise a little girl.  So now she's a little kid.  They're growing up, going to high school, trying to date, and they're these religious fanatic old people that are raising her.  So they completely turned her off to sex.  And she hasn't had sex.  She's a 50-year-old virgin. 
[03:16:00]  Woody, do something about that.  We tried.  Yeah, Woody.  No.  No.  Look at the guys.  No.  And these guys have done some things.  Come on.  The groupies they've had.  Forget about it.  8 to 80, blind, crippled, and crazy.  You didn't ask where they took me for my birthday.  Well, we were going to get into that, Patty.  Where did you go?  I went to my first male strip club.  Nice.  The first male strip club ever.  And they paid for a massage.  You went and got a massage? 
[03:16:30]  A massage.  I think it was like a back rub or something.  Whole body release.  A little more than a back rub.  But you saw in photos of that.  Did they touch your private parts?  Did they touch your twat?  No, but they kind of touched my boobies.  So, Patty, were you naked?  No.  What were you wearing?  Y'all leave this woman alone.  I was wearing a very short peach skirt with a floral type of a top of some kind. 
[03:17:00]  Periwinkle?  No.  Yeah, I think of a little shell on a sand when I think of Periwinkle, by the way.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, sure.  I have no idea what she's talking about.  So, Patty, you lay down on the table, and what was it?  A big masculine man came over?  No, I was sitting in the chair, and he kind of did a lap dance.  He did a lap dance.  Was he schlong hanging out?  Well.  Did he get to touch his hog?  Yeah.  Well, it kind of touched me. 
[03:17:30]  It did.  What did it do?  Oh, he was just shaking and moving along and, like, dancing and everything and all.  Was he naked?  Half naked.  What do you mean, half naked?  Well, he just about had his tighty-whities on.  That was about it.  So, when he rubbed his schlong against you, was it in the panties, or did he pull it out?  No, I think I know what TFing is now.  What?  And I wasn't, I was, like, a little more stunned than anything, so I was like, uh, okay. 
[03:18:00]  You got TF?  You got TF?  You know you have to have boobs to get TF, though.  Yeah.  I do have.  Well, I'm small.  What can I tell you?  I'm small, but he was rubbing it between them?  I'm small, and I'm proud of it.  Oh, very good.  He was rubbing it between your, uh...  I guess that's what you would call it, yeah.  Down south, we call it twigs and berries.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I got some twigs and berries.  He was hung like an acorn.  He didn't want any part of you. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, what is that about when they walk in and go, all right, I got a massage over here  in this room, let me walk in, and oh, God.  Think phone bill, car payments, whatever you're going to use the money for.  Yeah.  It was kind of fun.  I enjoyed that club.  You did?  Then we went to the Copacabana, I'm walking to the dark.  Where did you grow up?  Listen to the way she talks.  Wait, what?  And then we went...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  That's a dying breed right there.  Yeah, it certainly is.  You ain't going to see that.  You'll be sad when she's gone 50 years. 
[03:19:00]  Where did you go?  What was the name of the first club you went to, the strip club?  I don't remember.  You don't?  No, I don't remember the name of it.  I didn't really notice it.  Then what was the second place you went to?  The Copacabana.  The Copacabana.  What is that?  I was, like, dancing with the other girls, and all of a sudden some guy came along in,  you know, showed me how to do a little bit of the merengue or something, showed me some  steps, I guess, and then he just went to it. 
[03:19:30]  Copacabana.  So that was kind of nice.  I got to dance with a cute guy.  You want to go on the road with COC?  Come on.  What would I do?  It's made with Riko.  You're going to get me in trouble, man.  Her name was Lola.  She had tits like a cancer patient.  Oh, God damn.  And then the third place we went to was Red Rocks, I think it's called.  Jeez, these are like hip clubs. 
[03:20:00]  Wow, you're out and about.  I saw it dancing on the counter at, like, the cowboy dance they do, and they were breathing  fire with the alcohol and everything, and then they set the whole thing on fire, the  whole counter, so I'm, like, backed away because I was a little scared of that part.  Yeah, that's a little scary.  How old are the waiters to celebrate your 50th, huh?  Yeah, I went to three places I would never have gone into on my own.  Oh, Patty, she got a titfuck at the cup of kebunia. 
[03:20:30]  That's cool, Patty.  Sounds like I had a great night out.  Yeah, I got home 4.30 in the morning.  Whoa.  I was up for work at 9.30.  Wow.  Should have taken the day off.  Well, no, I had to close, so I have to be there because I have to do the registration.  So you're still a virgin, huh?  You didn't get laid.  It might still technically be a virgin, but I got my first exposure to, you know, in  the first class.  You want to show these guys your hot body? 
[03:21:00]  No.  It's too early, man.  Shit.  No.  Fucking, what a touring rock star says, no.  There's a problem.  You don't really, come on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.  You don't need to see the video when that happens.  Patty, I see a picture of you.  You also got a little makeover, I guess?  Sort of, yeah.  Wow.  A fright over.  Well, that'll work.  A fright over.  Well, that's just the close-up.  That's not a good photo of my son.  No, that is, wow. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  You look like a progeria kid ready to go on Maury.  Go to the other photos, really.  Yeah.  Go to the other photos.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Go to the other photos.  Set too far on the neck.  Yeah, like you're sticking your head out on your neck.  It's like they photoshopped you onto yourself.  You kind of look like a younger Ruth Buzzy in that shot.  Oh, I do.  Is that a compliment?  Yeah.  Well, uh.  That's one thing I love about being my age.  Is?  I still have to show my ID. 
[03:22:00]  What?  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Oh, yeah.  I think she does.  Wow.  All right.  That is something.  Do you have a question for Corrosion of Conformity?  What?  You ever hear their music?  I've never heard it.  I'm sorry.  That's good.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, really.  I mean, that is a good thing.  Pepper's like, pfft.  The demo.  Yeah, I guess it would be a good thing.  It's not the demo.  If she named the ten of your songs.  The dude doesn't fucking run like that.  I'm in trouble.  I'm a big fan.  No, she's a very nice lady. 
[03:22:30]  We were talking out in the lobby.  Well, to answer your question, she brought the chocolate-covered strawberries.  Oh.  Yeah, I work for Godiva, so.  Oh, do you really?  Godiva.  I'm going to see you at a big plaza.  Oh, there's the guy I was with.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wow.  So the guy, your arms are wrapped around this guy's ass.  You're sitting in a chair.  He put my hand there.  He's standing in front of you.  He took my hand and he put it there.  Yeah, right. 
[03:23:00]  And his large ebony arms are wrapped around your head.  And your head is like in his chest.  Looks like Patty had her own chocolate-covered strawberries.  And someday when they asked this guy, why did you quit stripping, he's going to rip this picture out.  Wow.  Something tells me the last time he was in that pose, he got a face full of mace.  Because that is not the kind of girl he's used to dancing for. 
[03:23:30]  Wow, Patty.  You were into him, though, a little bit?  It was kind of cute.  You're a virgin.  You've got to slow down.  Start off a little slower than that.  Start Asian.  Work your way up.  Yeah, start Asian.  Picture it like trying to park a combine in a one-car garage.  You want to start off with a Volkswagen, maybe.  We'll see how that works.  Where are you from?  Philippines.  Here's my number.  Yeah, you want it quick and painless the first time. 
[03:24:00]  You take on Mandingo over here, you're going to be in trouble.  Well, it just happened.  He suddenly just came right on over and did his thing.  That'll happen in trains, in platforms, back rooms.  Tried to lick my toes and push me out of the third rail.  Pushed me out of the tracks.  New Orleans is going to get hit by a freaking hurricane.  You see that?  Is that what happened?  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, yeah.  That's the first one of the season.  Fantastic.  They always talk about New Orleans when a hurricane's coming because you guys are under sea level over there.  You don't even know.  If the place floods out, if somebody cries, it's ridiculously low. 
[03:24:30]  And then if a hurricane hits...  It's like a birdbath.  It's literally like a roundabout levee.  If one of those suckers goes, it's over.  It's over.  Hopefully it happens during Mardi Gras.  They say you need to be at least 18 feet high to survive a hurricane in New Orleans.  You like the Mardi Gras down there?  Yeah.  You do?  We went down there.  Yeah, it's because you haven't been there with me.  Really?  Well, that's true.  We haven't.  Next time O.P. and Anthony go down there, you call Peppy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Where do you guys hang out down there when you're at Mardi Gras? 
[03:25:00]  Everywhere?  Go to all the clubs?  No.  No?  Just on the street?  No.  He knows the real places to hang out.  The back streets.  The back streets.  See, that's where I think the fun is.  Stay away from Bourbon Street.  I think the real fun is off Bourbon Street.  Oh, yeah.  Literally stinks.  Grossly.  And then we watched some assaults going on later in the evening before the cops closed it down.  There were some people walking down the sidewalk just being punched.  Just sucker punched.  Boof!  Oh, take that with you.  Yeah, they pretty much shut it down at midnight, man. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't mess around.  Let's go to Scott in Tennessee real fast.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if you guys are giving away any free trips to Aruba.  Maybe you can come back to you.  Oh, are you suggesting we send Patty to Aruba?  Hello?  It's working out well.  She'll come back fine.  I'm on live on the radio right now.  Hey, who's on the phone?  Who's Pepper talking to?  He's on the phone.  All right.  That girl back there?  Anything important?  I wouldn't believe who that was. 
[03:26:00]  Who was?  Anyone phone?  No.  Uh-oh.  Can't say?  Where's the picture of her?  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Let's see.  One of those.  Oh, hello.  No way.  Are you lying?  Wait, let me see that again.  Come on.  No way, Jose.  Turn the mics off for a second.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I got to hear who it was.  How do you know her?  I know all of these ladies.  We'll get back to that.  Oh, boy.  But I thought she's engaged.  I just met her at a book signing or something.  Is that who that was? 
[03:26:30]  Because I saw the picture from a distance, and I thought that's who it was.  Was that who I saw?  Yeah.  Because you flashed it fast.  I know.  Let's get her on the air.  Call her up.  Call her up.  I want to talk to her.  Call her back.  Stoller 69-er.  Call her back.  Yeah, call her back.  Get her on.  I want to get what she wants.  Hold on.  I'm going to put her.  I'm going to put her.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Hell, no.  You don't want to wreck that one.  I don't want to wreck that one.  But look, Patty's here for you.  That's a substitute.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:00]  Come on.  We've got to go down this road a little bit.  That's way too cool.  I'll come back next time.  Where'd you meet her?  See if we get further along the road here.  Meet her at the club?  You think there might be some something going on?  Some magic.  Some magic?  Possibly.  God damn.  You know what?  I'm just going to bow to him right now.  Yeah.  Thank you.  God damn.  I loved her video.  Fucking rock stars, man.  Wait, book signing?  I loved her video.  It was right after the book signing.  Or right after the video.  Really?  He's going to run into it.  Jane Fonda?  Excuse me.  Jane Fonda?  Jane Fonda? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Hanoi, Jane.  Wow.  Dude, you don't know how cool that just was.  That's what we've got to talk about.  I don't want to wreck it for the guy, though.  Yeah, right.  We'll talk about it on Monday when you're not here.  Call me back in a week.  Give me a week.  Give me a week.  And the fact that he blew her off for the show.  That's very impressive.  A week.  I thought I'd be calling you back.  Be running out that door right now.  I would have walked out on this show in a second.  Can someone at least call her to see if she would come on the air, or would that wreck  everything?  And then we'll move on.  Because Pepper's cool.  I mean, when he was passed down in that hotel, he came back on and talked to us about it. 
[03:28:00]  So, if he says give him a week, I say we give him a week to see if he can close the deal.  Close the deal.  I'm going to close the deal.  Try to close the deal, man.  You really think you could close the deal?  Close the deal.  Dude, we're hanging out with him.  Don't say close the deal.  That might not close the deal.  We're hanging out with Pepper and Mardi Gras.  Go on.  I told you.  You saw the picture, right?  Yeah.  And I'm pretty sure I know who it was.  Right?  Yeah, write it down on that piece of paper.  No.  Get my ass busted.  Let me just say it.  I won't say anything. 
[03:28:30]  I won't say it.  It doesn't matter.  You're just like, Gus.  You had a brag.  You showed him the goddamn picture.  You barely know it.  Just write it down.  But you're like, hey, man, I got a brag on this one.  You can write down the first letter.  Yeah, that's all I needed.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's who it was?  Okay.  Wait, I got to ask him.  Let me write here.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course it was.  We.  We.  That's pretty good.  Wow, that's pretty good company. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  Very nice.  I run with a good crowd.  And you, apparently, you met her and gave her your phone number.  She gave me hers, actually.  Yeah.  You gave.  Wow.  All right.  I just want to know.  Tell her like it is, dude.  I'm trying to get a little more info.  This is the news.  This is what I want to hear.  Yes, sir.  Are you going to at least work it?  Can we go back to talking about.  No, not at all.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Was that call a, I'll call you back? 
[03:29:30]  You heard me on the damn phone just now, didn't you?  I know, but I didn't know who it was then, so I wasn't really paying attention.  I'd have hung on every word if I knew.  Was that an I'll call you back?  Yes, it was.  He said, I'm live on the radio show.  I'll call you back.  I'll call you back.  Yeah.  Call you right back.  You could tell everyone.  Let's get this thing going.  Time's ticking away right now.  Jesus Christ.  You could tell everyone tonight at Irving Plaza in between songs who called you on the show today.  I don't have to do that.  She might be there.  Oh, boy. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, boy.  No, she's not anywhere right now.  Yeah.  Wow, dude.  That'd be huge news.  Call her back.  No, I'm not calling her back.  You don't have to put her on the air.  Just call her on, and we'll hear your side of the conversation.  Yeah, just call her back right now.  On a satellite radio show.  No, no, just call her back on your cell phone.  I know you guys better than you think I do.  Just call her on the cell phone, that's all.  We'll just listen to your side of the conversation.  Yeah, I want to hear how you work it.  No.  Yeah, how Peppa works is women here.  God damn.  That's some high maintenance right there. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, we'll see.  We'll see.  So you can't, like, wave that in front of us.  I know.  We're like children.  It's candy, and all of a sudden you took it, and we're going to sit here and cry.  This is genius.  This is probably one of my most genius things.  Oh, this might have been a marketing ploy.  Oh, no.  All right, Mike, what's up?  Yo, hello?  Hey.  Hello.  Yeah, you've got to give us a fucking way.  She's in a video, she did a book signing, and she's engaged.  I'm trying to put the fucking pieces together.  Well, I don't know if it was...  Was it her book signing? 
[03:31:00]  Say that again?  No, I'm asking Peppa a question.  No.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I don't think she has a book out right now.  Stankfish from Whackbag?  Correct.  Wow, that's something.  Yeah, everybody on Whackbag is saying that.  They got it.  Whackbag.  Whackbag.  Whackbag.com is our website of pests and annoying bastards that are also fans of our show. 
[03:31:30]  When we were driving over here, I saw this giant inflatable rat on the back of a truck.  Oh, yeah, the protest rat.  That's the protest rat.  It's a scab rat or something.  It's a scab rat, yeah.  So if they're scab workers...  I like that.  That's a union thing, man.  You don't mess with the big rat.  They'll send...  Yeah, if you get scab non-union employees working at your place, the union guys come up with  a huge blow-up rat in front of your building.  New York.  Nice.  I love it.  Let's go to Tom in North Carolina.  Tom?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[03:32:00]  Hey.  Hey, I was just going to call and bust in you guys yesterday when you were talking about Tom  Cruise on Oprah's show, how the ladies were hanging on every word he said.  Right, yeah.  It sounded just like that with you guys hanging on every word of Pepper's story.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Doesn't seem weird that Tom Cruise keeps doing all that kind of stuff whenever he's got a  movie coming out or something.  That's what we were saying, yeah.  It's very coincidental that it's just when he has movies coming out that he's falling  in love with these women.  Bouncing on the couch.  You just never hear...  Yeah.  Like an idiot.  You think it's a real relationship? 
[03:32:30]  You talking to me?  Yeah.  You talking to me?  I don't know.  I don't give a shit.  It seems a little fishy, though.  Pepper don't care.  He's got his own shit working out.  Yeah, no doubt, man.  He's working it.  You staying in town?  Yeah, we're in Manhattan tonight.  What hotel are you staying in?  Yeah, I think we can make about $100,000 on a little photo, man.  Minimum of $100,000.  Are you kidding me?  That was too funny.  I'm following you. 
[03:33:00]  It was like $8,000 this weekend.  I'd be more photographers at the show than fucking people seeing it.  Is it the W?  The Sheridan?  Which one could it be?  Is it the same hotel you passed out at?  The park?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  It's a wonderful hotel.  Just look out the window here and...  I'm trying to rattle off hotel names in my head.  I can't seem to think of them all.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, think of it.  All right.  Great.  All right.  Tonight, Irving Plaza.  Get over there.  Get the fuck over there.  You guys are going to be in Philly, the Norvith Theater in Norfolk, Virginia, the 12th. 
[03:33:30]  You know what they say about the girls in Norfolk, don't you?  What?  Don't drink, don't smoke, nor fuck.  Oh, really?  That bad?  That's pretty bad.  Norfolk.  I'm going to be at the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia, the 25th.  It's kind of funny.  We're going to miss each other by three weeks in the whole city.  Falls Church is a nice place.  Yeah.  And I'm sure you get phone calls just like Pepper got.  Yeah.  Kind of, yeah.  Happens all the time.  The look on Jimmy's face. 
[03:34:00]  That lying, blinking look.  Was that picture taken recently?  Like, what, last night?  The night before?  Three nights.  Three nights ago, that picture was taken?  Yeah.  Is it clothed or naked?  It's clothed, right?  It's clothed.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was expecting him to show me like a groupie with a really hot body naked, but then  when he showed me that picture, I went, what?  Are you kidding?  Jesus.  All right, why don't we take a quick break?  I'm just like, phew.  What? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, he's saying something in the control room.  Oh, there's no more?  No breaks.  No breaks.  No breaks.  We're just right off to the end of the show.  Okay, there's no more breaks.  Mm-hmm.  I was going to...  So, yeah, tell everybody to come out to the damn show.  They will.  Everything Plaza tonight here in New York.  All those old punks working in Manhattan right now listening to you guys.  And you got a website for all the other tour dates because there's a million of them here  and it's a national show, so...  Yeah, we're going all the way to the 28th or something of July.  CoC.com.  You were talking about Dimebag before the break, too. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, y'all were playing...  I don't even...  I was just crawling out of my hole when I heard the Vanilla Ice.  Wait, you got XM?  No, I just literally stepped up the bus and the guy who drove us here had it.  Oh, okay.  And they were...  Vanilla Ice played a song or some shit like that.  Ice Ice Baby?  Was that who that was?  What?  Was that Vanilla Ice?  Yeah, Vanilla Ice doing Destiny's Child.  Doing Survivor.  But he had changed some words around.  I caught it.  He mentioned Daryl, Dimebag. 
[03:35:30]  I thought I heard that.  Yeah.  Really?  I thought I heard Dimebag.  Strumming or something?  What did he say, Ross?  That was the way to go.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that.  Yeah, I thought that was pretty...  I couldn't get past the awfulness of the song he chose to sing.  Well, did he change that or was that like one of their lyrics?  No, he threw it.  Yeah, he threw it.  Destiny's Child singing about Dimebag.  Yeah, probably not.  Probably not.  Well, let's take a listen.  Let's take a listen.  Safe to assume.  It was that little blurb y'all played.  Right here. 
[03:36:00]  It's somewhere in this mess.  That's terrible.  It's not about the industry.  And it's not about the things that I've been through.  Like Northern JV.  See, I've seen a lot of things on the road to construction.  Addiction to this rap game.  Sand is up and buttin'.  This ain't a comeback.  This ain't a second coming.  We took a real loss when Dimebag stopped strumming. 
[03:36:30]  American style strumming.  You heard it?  We took a real loss when Dimebag stopped strumming.  American style strumming.  Yeah, I don't think that's in the original song.  He's comparing himself to Dimebag?  No, he's just talking about the industry.  I don't think he should.  Right.  I don't think he is.  That was very interesting.  I caught that.  Huh.  I thought I heard Dimebag, and I'm like, no, I just figured I'd be wrong.  What kind of relationship did Vanilla Ice have with Dimebag?  Probably none.  None?  None whatsoever?  Well, you guys were friends with Dimebag, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, man.  I can't picture anyone wanting to associate with Vanilla Ice.  I can't picture anyone wanting to associate with Vanilla Ice. 
[03:37:00]  I'm sure hanging him outside a hotel demanding a signature.  Love Shug Night.  Sign this, Cracker.  Okay, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Right away, sir.  That's a little weird.  Odd.  Hey, are you guys on Oz Festival this year?  Nope.  Trying to find someone to introduce me to Sabbath.  Have you met Sabbath?  Yep.  Fuck.  Not all at one time, but individually.  I owe me Ward.  Ozzy I've met a couple of times, but I've never met the other three.  Yeah, we had Ozzy in studios.  It was a great day for all of us.  Nice.  Way to get to. 
[03:37:30]  Look up, Jimmy, in this room right here.  Yeah, right here.  I miss you guys.  I was at that 30th anniversary Motorhead's gig in L.A., but I came late, I think, towards  when Jericho was on.  Did you see how many guests that Motorhead had at that show?  Yeah.  It was like a who's who of heavy metal.  I met Ronnie James Dio.  I got a shot with Dio that night, too.  Rick Flair.  Rick Flair, I got to.  I enjoyed him.  Rick Flair.  Woo!  Woo!  I didn't know half of the guys were, though.  I knew some of them were, like, old 80s guys, but I couldn't recognize a lot of them.  Yeah, I didn't recognize a bunch of them, either.  How great was Dio, though? 
[03:38:00]  He's like 4'10".  He's cool as shit, too.  He's great.  He's got a little tiny voice.  Oh, he's a little fellow, yeah.  And Lemmy is just the shit, man.  The animal.  Right.  Gotta love Lemmy.  We sat down with him.  I got to play a song with him on the last night of the tour.  Did Overkill.  I told Lemmy I felt like the little ball-headed kid with cancer in the Make-A-Wish.  He's right.  Man, I've told this story a thousand times, but my band, before I got into radio, my band  got to open up for Motorhead here in New York City once, and it was one of the best  moments just to, you know, you've got a hero, Lemmy, Motorhead. 
[03:38:30]  And my guitar player got so drunk drinking with Lemmy backstage, he was still like going  shot for shot, drinking Maker's Mark with him, that he fucked the whole gig up.  He was so drunk, he couldn't play.  And I was just so psyched that we were opening for Lemmy, and the guitarist was so smashed,  he couldn't even stand up.  He was all fucked up.  I love it when that happens.  Isn't that great?  That's rock and roll, man.  Happens every once in a while.  Vomit on yourself while you're playing. 
[03:39:00]  Puke on yourself.  And then while we were leaving, something happened.  He was so fucking drunk, he wound up stealing someone's equipment.  And like, then we got back and just kicked his ass about it.  We're like, dude, you're a fucking asshole.  You're drunk, stealing other people's shit.  We had to bring it back.  Oh, man.  Yeah, returning this shit.  And this asshole.  Bands, they stink, don't they?  Being in them.  You've got to deal with your asshole bandmates sometimes.  A little whack here and there. 
[03:39:30]  You guys fight at all or get along pretty well?  We get along pretty well.  Yeah.  A lot of...  Yeah.  Over the hump, as it were.  Because I know...  We learned how to do it a long time.  Yeah.  Early on, you got the new relationship with the band, and then you fall into that, I hate  this son of a bitch, but, you know...  We've been through that.  We've gotten rid of all the son of a bitches.  Yeah.  We weeded them out.  You weeded them out.  And then it's smooth sailing once you get past the hump.  Me and Woody just make sure anybody in the band listens to us. 
[03:40:00]  That's what you got to do.  You need the two guys that really, you know, hold the shit together.  And then if the other guys don't want to deal with it, you're fucking out.  Gene and Paul.  Surround yourself by Yes Men and you'll be fine.  We'll get somebody else.  They can play the shit.  He's like, nah, man, I got new guys that I like.  Come on.  If you could pull a train with one rock star, who would it be?  Pull a train?  Yeah.  Yeah, judge in front of the picture on his phone. 
[03:40:30]  He's got a sexual term or something.  Like, if you could get blown, like, while another guy...  Like, you ever pull a train with your friends?  Like, one's getting blown, one's anger.  See, we...  Man, what kind of show is this?  What's going on here?  Pepper.  I could pull a train.  Hold on, Pepper.  No, no.  I'm with you.  He's saying, Anthony and I are with you, by the way.  Yeah, like, who would be your ideal?  You think I fucking haven't pulled a fucking train with?  No, I'm sure you pulled many trains, sir.  What I'm saying is...  Sorry.  If you had to choose someone to pull a train with, who would it be?  Like, who would be your ideal train mate you could high-five while some chick is vomiting  on your dick while he bangs her?  Like, Jimmy and Ron Jeremy. 
[03:41:00]  Meatloaf.  Jimmy and Ron Jeremy.  Oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy and Ron Jeremy.  Me and Meatloaf pulling a train.  Did a little something with a girl.  Who did?  Me and Ron Jeremy.  I pulled a train with Ron Jeremy, but it wasn't a real train.  He was fucking her, and I just got blown into my dick, lost its...  You know.  Looking at Ron Jeremy.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm like, God, that lucky girl.  You guys put her on the rotisserie, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got photos.  This guy, Dennis owns the bunny ranch, took pictures of her blowing me and fucking Ron  banging it.  It was really hot.  Fantastic. 
[03:41:30]  It goes in the family album you keep on the coffee table.  My mom commented, your cock looks thick.  I'm like, oh, cut it out, you.  Stop being so silly.  You are just too inappropriate, Jimmy, when we have guests here in the studio.  These guys are rock stars.  I don't care.  Pulling a train.  They are rock stars, man.  The fucking lives these guys live in.  Yeah, this is nothing.  Everything a comedian wants to be.  This is nothing to these guys.  You want to do anything else?  Because a lot of times rock stars, like guys, anybody who has any other job wants to  be a rock star, and then you find out rock stars want to do something else.  That's right.  Anything you guys aspire to do, besides from a... 
[03:42:00]  I deliver yachts from the Caribbean back to the United States a lot, in between records  and shit.  Oh.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Like crewing and stuff.  Have you really done that?  All the time.  Really?  I just got a call from a guy in Norfolk.  He's a sailor?  You're a sailor?  I wouldn't say sailor.  You're a motor.  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought, a lot of times people that do that are like sailors, but you're...  I'm not a sailor.  You're a motor.  Hey, I certainly didn't put that list in there.  I would never even apply that with that picture on your phone, my friend. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, motorboats, then.  Motor yachts.  A lot of those rich guys want their boats delivered back from, like, St. John, back to  Fort Lauderdale, but they don't want to take a two-week trip.  With holes full of cocaine.  So you and the crew are on this guy's mega yacht, and he's the owner's not on it, and  you've got two weeks to get it back.  Do you call your friends and say, hey, man, join me?  I know who I'd call.  Of course you do.  Call that girl.  See what I'm talking about.  Exactly.  Yeah, you want to go on a little cruise?  That's what I'm working there, homie. 
[03:43:00]  That's the work, and he's going to be delivering a yacht.  Aw, come on.  Pepper's got it all for you.  He's a rock star, delivering the yacht.  Call up the chicks.  Pepper, you're going to give us an update on this, right?  Yes, I'll call you from the satellite phone.  You're becoming part of this radio show with your crazy story.  When I'm in Anagua, off the coast of the Bahamas, I'll give you a call.  We're going to give you a week to close the deal, and then you've got to call us and let us know how it was.  Hey, the girl isn't important.  Tonight, you have one night in New York, which is Irving Plaza tonight. 
[03:43:30]  Right.  We're playing with a band called Crowbar, who is Kirk, a good friend of ours.  He's killer.  And a band called Alabama Thunder Pussy.  Oh, yeah, I've heard of them.  Yeah, they're good.  And then Philly tomorrow night at the Trocadero, the Norva Theater in Norfolk, Virginia, on the 12th.  And then it just goes on and on and on.  Yeah, yeah, on and on and on.  CoC.com.  CoC.com?  Yeah, for tour dates.  All right, we've got to get out of here, unfortunately.  Yep. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, we're done.  Thank you very much for joining us today.  Don't let your meatloaf.  Don't let your meatloaf.  And we want to thank Mr. Huff, Richard Huff, for exposing us to more people today as far  as the assault on the media goes.  Check out the Daily News if you haven't read it yet.  And don't forget to watch Monday.  See you.  Bye.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  This is the Big Comedy Show. </pre>
