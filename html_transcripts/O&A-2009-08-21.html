<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Worst Of" compilation hosted by Club Soda Kenny, filling in for the deceased Louis C.K.  This segment featured a Dump Report detailing offensive statements from previous shows, focusing on profanity and sexually explicit content.  Discussions centered on the unpleasant realities of parenthood, including graphic descriptions of children's bodily functions, and the deterioration of Louis C.K.'s marriage, touching upon their sex life and therapy sessions.  Rich Voss was a guest in the studio during this segment.  The segment also included discussions of sexually transmitted infections, specifically crabs and syphilis.

The show continued with callers sharing their marital struggles, often using highly offensive and misogynistic language to describe their spouses.  Opie, Anthony, and guest Jim Norton joined in the conversation, discussing the challenges of maintaining relationships, particularly with children.

A later segment featured Club Soda Kenny's eclectic musical tastes, ranging from Elvis Costello to Snoop Dogg, providing comedic fodder due to his lack of musical knowledge.  Louis C.K. then joined the studio, contributing to the marriage discussions and sharing a humorous anecdote about forgetting his daughter's backpack, leading to a funny phone call with his wife.  The conversation then branched out to credit card theft and online scams. The ongoing joke about Pat Duffy's mission to deliver the backpack continued throughout the show.

The next segment started with callers describing fraudulent credit card charges from pornography websites and FreeCreditReport.com.  This transitioned into a discussion about paranoia, fueled by Patrice's comments on navigation systems and E-ZPass, which devolved into a racially charged exchange between Patrice and Opie concerning racial advantages and disadvantages. Patrice revealed his mixed Mexican and Jewish heritage, leading to a further discussion on racial identity.  Louis C.K. again joined the show, discussing the recent death of his dog, sharing emotional details about its passing and cremation.  This sparked conversations about grief, death, handling deceased pets, roadside memorials, and Louis C.K.'s anecdote about unknowingly leaving a convenience store without paying for water, attributing it to "white privilege." A caller then shared the unusual request of a colleague to have their skull displayed after death.

The show moved on to a discussion about what to do with a deceased grandfather's skull, suggesting uses ranging from Halloween decorations to a bong.  This led to a graphic recounting of a terrifyingly bumpy, low-fuel flight landing at LaGuardia, with vivid descriptions of passenger fear and speculation about the pilot's competence.  A caller, a former jet mechanic, refuted the pilot's claim of visually checking the fuel level. The discussion then shifted to a harrowing boating trip down the Hudson River on a dilapidated boat, detailing near-disastrous encounters with ferries and currents.  A significant portion of this segment involved a discussion of Louis C.K.'s alleged theft of a comedic bit from Dennis Leary, who joined the show in-studio to dispute C.K.'s account and offer his own perspective, including a claim that the bit was originally written by a third party.  Leary also addressed C.K.'s comment about the money received as "guilt money," and sang a line from the song in question.

The final segment began with a crude recounting of Nantucket's history and the relocation of whalers to Hudson, New York.  A caller, Steve from Pennsylvania, shared his harrowing boat launch experience.  The conversation then returned to Louis C.K.'s parenting frustrations, focusing on unpleasant smells, parental exhaustion, and the surprising appeal of his dark humor to soccer moms.  Rich Voss, present in the studio, shared his own parenting experiences, including falling asleep at a Louis C.K. show.  The segment concluded with further discussions of boating mishaps, interspersed with off-color jokes and banter, including a running gag about Kenny's dinosaur-like resemblance.  Rich Voss contributed with a meandering, nonsensical story, eventually apologizing to Louis C.K.  The hosts frequently interrupted each other in a series of increasingly absurd side conversations.  Both Rich Voss and Louis C.K. were guests in the studio during this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Worst of Opie and Anthony, brought to you by Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Bastards, starring Brad Pitt.  In theaters today.  This great station supplier is new.  Sirius 197 XM 202. 
[00:00:30]  All right, here we go.  Presenting a special edition of The Worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by some of your favorite comedians from The Opie and Anthony Show, including Bill Burr.  Hey.  Bob Kelly.  Fucking I suck.  Patrice O'Neill.  Ready, nigga?  Rich Voss.  I've done Kimmel.  And Louis C.K.  Tune in every day this week as a different comedian from The Opie and Anthony Show hosts The Worst of The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, it's Jim Norton.  It's Comic Week on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Louis C.K. was supposed to be hosting today's show, but unfortunately he died of AIDS.  But before he died, he was pretty busy with being nominated for an Emmy for his HBO special Chewed Up, which was brilliant.  He had joined the cast of NBC's Parks and Recreation, was supposed to be appearing in the new Ricky Gervais project, The Invention of Lying,  and was supposed to shoot a pilot for a new FX Network show.  But since Lou decided to just not take care of himself and drop dead, Club Soda Kenny will sit in his place. 
[00:01:30]  Rest in peace, Lou.  Thanks, James.  No, there's no compromise.  Is this thing on?  There's an argument over the screen thing, because somebody doesn't like me popping my peas.  But they have to realize that is my trademark.  I love to pop my peas and take a pea.  So I will not be using a windscreen. 
[00:02:00]  Hi, it's me.  Filling in for the great Louis C.K.  I will be hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony for the next five hours.  Tick-tock.  Time keeps slipping into the future.  What time is it now?  Half past the cow's ass according to his balls.  Some people say a quarter to his balls, but I don't buy it. 
[00:02:30]  Listen to this now.  Title, Louis C.K. Having Kids.  Rich Voss in studio.  They rip on Rich Voss' hands.  Louis talks about his daughter's shit story.  Anthony talks about why kids aren't allowed in his house.  Louis and Jim talk about stories from Lucky Louie.  They talk about gross sex stories.  Kenny finishes his dump report.  And in case you don't know, a dump report is not about bowel movements. 
[00:03:00]  It's like when they used to be on terrestrial radio and somebody cursed and they had to beep it out.  It was called being dumped out on.  And then I used to report about that.  So now you know.  Broadcasting the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Hosted by Club Soda Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Time for the dump report.  Live from the O.B. and Anthony show studios.  The Daily Dump Report.  Wait.  Look at Kenny's glasses.  And I don't know.  You want me to try to do it without it?  I feel like Walter Cronkite when Kennedy died. 
[00:03:30]  It was 3.15 this afternoon.  New Norton said cunt.  The nation mourns.  Dab your eye.  Take your glasses off.  The glasses aren't even that bad.  It's the fact that you don't have them all the way up when you read.  Are they bifocals?  Does Club Soda Kenny have bifocals?  No, no.  I just need them for reading.  Ew.  Why don't you take them off and try it?  I want to see how you do without them.  This one's for long distance.  And then when I look up, I could beat a perp's skull in.  Well, it's like we were talking today.  It was somebody who did something he didn't like. 
[00:04:00]  And he goes, I told that guy, like, look, I took the heat.  I didn't tattletale on you.  Tattletale.  He says tattletale.  All right, Serpico.  It's very demeaning.  All right, go ahead.  Tattletale.  6.42 a.m., that Canadian guy.  Yeah.  Fucking right on fuck and another fucker, too.  Wow, really?  It's gray area.  I didn't realize that.  He's an unrefined fellow.  I didn't know that Canuck who had such a potty mouth. 
[00:04:30]  7.48 a.m., is she having an orgasm or decomposing?  Orgasm.  Really?  Why can't you say, is she having an orgasm?  Because women shouldn't come.  They're dirty.  Yeah.  That's why.  All right.  Now I...  Call off their clitorises and let them do their jobs under our bodies.  You're not trying to do womb with teeth.  You're not doing the job here.  First of all, you missed 7.44.  All right, I'll have my glasses on. 
[00:05:00]  All right, get your glasses on.  Blind ass.  All right, get your glasses on.  Because this is very entertaining for the folks.  Because when he describes how the curse was used is the funniest part of this, though.  All right, I'll...  Go to 7.44.  I'm sorry, I missed 7.44.  If the light hits his glasses and his hair, it bursts into flames.  I'm sorry, you can't use him out in the sun.  You can only read with moonlight.  7.44, Mr. Louis C.K.  Somebody did me in the mouth during discussion of doctor who sexually assaulted or raped patients 
[00:05:30]  after they were knocked out.  Someone fucked my throat is what I meant to say.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought I cleaned it enough.  You might as well have just said that.  Can I say someone treated my mouth like a cunt?  You know what?  You might as well just let it fly, Louis.  Yeah.  So the ex-ambers could enjoy it.  I guess so.  And then 7.48, Rich Voss, is she having an orgasm or decomposing during a discussion of  a story where somebody dug up a body and had sex with it? 
[00:06:00]  That's a bad dump.  That should not have been dumped.  It's a bad joke.  No, it isn't.  But it's...  I'm teasing, of course, Mr. Voss.  That should not have been dumped.  No.  It shouldn't have been dumped.  It should have been dumped.  America needed to hear that on election morning.  Right.  The next day.  This is a new era.  Exactly.  The Democrats have taken over.  Was she coming or...  No more fear.  Yeah.  No more fear.  Maybe that'll be better for us, the Democrats take over.  No, it won't.  All right.  No, it won't.  It's not good.  Hey, Al Gore's cunty wife is the one who started all that labor. 
[00:06:30]  That's right.  That's right.  PMRC, man.  Remember, that's a big battle.  She is cunty.  She is cunty.  Want to put labels on her albums, man.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Shut up.  What was she for the Ladybug song?  I know.  I know.  Oh, hey, Rich.  Oh, boy.  Very good.  Uncle Rich's tickles.  Let's fall back.  Let's sleep in her fucking husband's withered switch.  I'm going to call Tucker Carlson, man.  You're right there, man.  That's true.  Got to get you a spot on MSNBC.  Political humor.  Here's how you know a voice is about to say something dumb.  Because his hands are stiff and he starts to use his hands. 
[00:07:00]  He says, Rich, you use your hands when you get nervous.  Oh, my God.  And his hands go out and his eyes open wide and you just know he's searching.  And all he's saying is, please, God, let this come out right.  I know what I mean.  Please, God, let it come out right.  His hands get stiff and he just shakes them.  You can't tell if he's making a fist ever either.  No.  You just don't know.  Bendless fingers.  It's just the same.  Like John McCain's arms.  Something happened.  Tiny.  Did you lose your hands in Vietnam?  What's going on there? 
[00:07:30]  They replaced them with turtle feet.  Right.  Something's going on there.  They are weird.  They're awful.  I never noticed that.  They're gargoyle hands.  The first night we were eating dinner and then you looked at my hands and you just stopped  and go, look at your hand.  They're like not evolved.  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's one knuckle.  He's one knuckle short of a human hand on each finger.  But they're all the same size.  His thumbs and his fucking middle fingers are the same.  Yeah, they're all the same size. 
[00:08:00]  Like everyone else, the middle one's a little longer and then...  If my kid drew his hands that way, I would fucking punch her.  Learn how to draw, you stupid little cunts.  What's wrong with you?  It's not how you draw a human hand.  What the fuck are you doing?  I've got web...  Web hands that aren't connected.  That's what it looks like.  And he's a great golfer.  I don't get it.  I've been trying to stupid little cunts. 
[00:08:30]  Fucking beat her for that.  All right, Kenny, continue.  Oh, that's fucking funny, man.  7.49 a.m., Louis C.K. again.  Drink this homeless guy's urine.  Oh, come on.  What's wrong with that?  They didn't say piss?  No.  No.  I used a clinical term.  Yeah.  Right.  A minute later, 7.50, Louis C.K.  Jesus, sorry.  Touch their bodies with your penis.  All right.  Well, we knew where that one was going.  See, I knew it was coming out.  We sacrificed that. 
[00:09:00]  7.54, Dane Cook chimes in, we should all be molested by third and fourth graders.  That's not what it says there, Kenny.  No, by third or fourth, right?  Imagine being molested by a third or fourth.  You made it funnier, but the line was, we should all be molested by the third or fourth grade.  Oh, yeah, that's different.  I thought it was a typo.  That's a CBS thing.  Yeah, they have a problem with...  Any hot stuff. 
[00:09:30]  Youngster stuff.  Yeah, kid stuff.  They're like, no way.  All right.  7.54 a.m., Rich Voss has a small penis.  I didn't say that.  Why can't you say that?  Because facts are not allowed on the radio.  8 o'clock, Louis C.K.  After Voss said 12 inches, you mean his penis?  Oh, my God.  What baby's out?  What are you doing?  Is that an FCC thing?  Yeah, the FCC has tightened up, unfortunately. 
[00:10:00]  8.20, I like this one from Louis C.K.  Little girl vagina smell.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you were describing that as a father, describing a stinky daughter.  Smelly vagina of my daughter.  I desperately wanted to ask a lot of questions about that, because I've never heard that from  a parent before, that you could smell.  No parent would say it.  They're fucking liars.  They're just liars.  You can tell the difference between the ass smell and that smell at that age. 
[00:10:30]  If any person, fucking vaginas have a distinctive odor.  If it's her ass, she's going to die soon.  If her fucking ass smells like fucking rotted clams, I was really wrong.  Did you have a clue?  God damn.  I had no clue.  No, not having any children or knowing any people with girls that I would be around while  they're dirty.  No.  I figured it smelled like powder and shit.  I didn't know what kids smell.  I figured every kid smells good. 
[00:11:00]  When you have kids, as a guy, your relationship to the vagina, it just changes completely.  Really?  Because there's always this mysterious, beautiful little pouty thing that I'd only catch in  glimpses in the dark maybe three times in 40 years.  And now I've got to clean shit out of two of them daily.  I have to literally scrape shit out of my daughter's little red vagina a few times a day.  A few times a day.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:30]  Got to get in there with the wipey, make a corner out of it, and get the shit out of  it.  Holy fuck.  Every time she takes a shit, it goes straight up her gun.  Oh, my God.  I had no idea.  It's true.  The parents out there are all nodding.  Yeah, they're all going, yep.  I had no clue.  That's what it is.  No, and my four-year-old doesn't, you know, she is toilet trained, but she'll lay on the  carpet spreading it out, like pulling it open like a fucking hustler, like Marilyn Chambers, 
[00:12:00]  like fucking yanking it open and just going, man, like just lays there doing that.  Why?  Because that's what people want to do.  I mean, that's the happiest I've ever seen any person, is her laying on the floor pulling  her vagina open for the world, and I look at her and I realize that's a human being.  That's a human being being happy, and for some reason, that's not okay, and I have to  like inhibit that so she won't be homeless.  What do you mean homeless?  I don't want to put her up there. 
[00:12:30]  She continues doing that.  She's going to be in a mansion somewhere.  What are you doing?  Because that's got to be one of those awkward things where you don't want to put too much  emphasis on it.  No, you can't go stop that.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop that.  I feel like you're an animal.  No, but you have to tell her that that's not right, so what do you-  You have to explain to her calmly that vaginas, when held wide open, hurt people's feelings.  Or you bring your wife in and go, why don't you start doing that?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, no, you just let her do it.  I have no reason to stop her right now.  Yeah, that's just terrific. 
[00:13:00]  People don't come over that often.  But she will, like, she'll reach in her cute little girl underwear and scratch her asshole  like a knuckle deep, stick her finger in her ass in front of people, and then smells  her finger.  She does that with no reserve.  Holy shit.  Norton still does that.  What the hell?  Yeah.  My ex-girlfriend used to do that.  One time I caught her, she was sitting on her ass, and her legs were up, and she was  sniffing her asshole with her finger.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Ew.  What are you doing?  No, like my- 
[00:13:30]  I had this moment with my-  That's what it is really like.  Parents dress their kids up and bring them out in public so that we can all see how cute  they are, but at home, it's just fucking disgusting.  I was taking a shit the other day, and my wife was out of the house, so I have to shit  with the door open, because I have to watch my kids.  Otherwise, I have to gather them in to watch daddy shit.  That's the only alternative.  So I'm shitting with the door open and watching my daughter, who's standing there in a t-shirt  and no diaper.  Occasionally, we want to let her vagina breathe, and I have all these American fucking products  on it. 
[00:14:00]  And she's watching her from behind, and just a little dark spot just appears between her  cheeks, and I didn't- honestly, for a second, I didn't realize what it was, because I've  never just seen an ass shitting in the open.  I know Jim has paid well for that.  He says, yeah, he missed that pleasure.  And then next thing I know, a fucking man-sized crap just fucking-  Oh my.  She shits on the floor, and then she slips on- keep in mind, I'm shitting at the moment.  She slips on her own shit, falls deeply into it, cracks her head, and now she's laying in 
[00:14:30]  her own shit and crying her eyes out, because she got hurt.  And I, with shit hanging out of my ass, I gotta get up and waddle over.  I gotta do the penguin walk over, and pick her up and comfort her, and we're both covered  in my shit, her shit, the dog is trying to lick it up, because the dog loves my daughter's  shit he tries to eat.  And now-  What a fucking mad house!  Yes, that's my house!  And they're speaking German.  And the tape's rolling.  But this is the stuff that happens.  That is fucked. 
[00:15:00]  This is a regular day.  Regular day.  That is why I will never, ever take food from a child.  I don't like children touch-  Like, it's always, yeah, oh, a cookie, you brought me a cookie!  And they're, like, slobbering over half of it.  And someone in the house, though, will eat this fucking piece of-  Yeah, no.  Mucus-y, spitty, shitty cookie.  I'm looking like, don't even get that kid fucking near me.  No.  I threw away a couch, because we had family come over, and two little boys, sitting on 
[00:15:30]  the couch with their father, watching television, and the father goes, what did you just do?  And I'm sitting on the couch, like, oh, Christ on a pony, what the fuck is-  And the kid goes, nothing.  And the father goes, no, did you pick your nose?  And the kid starts kind of laughing, yeah.  You wiped it on the couch.  He goes, yeah, it fell.  He goes, well, now we gotta look for it.  So they're foraging through my modular couch for a booger that they never fucking found.  No, of course not. 
[00:16:00]  I then spent weeks sitting in a little shit chair, this beautiful couch, sitting in a  shit chair, until a new couch is delivered, and the old one was thrown away.  And the old, by old, I mean maybe two years old, threw that fucking couch away and made  a new rule, no kids ever in my fucking house.  No, keep them out.  That's it.  They're rancid little creeps.  My girlfriend had to go around, like, waist high with Windex and everything else, every  other kind of cleaner on the walls, because there's smear marks, nose prints made of snot 
[00:16:30]  on the sliding glass doors, little handprints like the end of fucking Blair Witch Project  all over your walls.  I was like, that's it.  No, the most disgusting thing that happens is when we change the baby's diaper, and it's  a big, you know, just shit-piss diaper, and then the dog, if we don't throw it away immediately  in a sealed container, the dog will find it and just fucking eat it and leave the residue  all over the floor.  Fucking chewed up, shit-piss diaper, and the chemicals from the diaper. 
[00:17:00]  How do you live like that?  It's fucking rotten.  How do you fucking live like that as a human?  Just regretfully.  I regret this with a huge amount of regret.  I thought this would be a cool thing, having kids.  Hey, you hit a nerve there, Louie.  Let's go to John Jersey.  Kenny, we'll get to you in a second.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's going on?  I wanted to say, though, I can totally relate to you about the vagina issue, because I've wiped  shit out of my daughter's vagina numerous times.  I'm born.  I still have to get in there once in a while to fucking, you know, when she craps herself with 
[00:17:30]  eight-inch-friggin'-long logs.  Are you telling your wife?  That's the thing.  You gotta, if you're a father, you should change diapers from the beginning.  You should change diapers from the beginning.  That's the trick.  Because when you first get diapers, they have the merconium, which isn't really shit.  It's just this black sludge that comes out of their ass from their firstborn.  And then it starts getting a little, uh, fetid.  Yeah.  You get, you, you work up to it.  You mix, you start mixing some other ingredients in there, right?  Yeah, because I went on the road for a while, and I didn't, I went away from it, and my 
[00:18:00]  daughter kind of turned the corner on me, and then I come back, I'm just, it's a guy's  shit.  After a while, it's just a big fucking dumperoo.  Oh, my God.  And you gotta clean it.  Well, that is the last brown thing you want to see in your daughter's vagina.  I guess it could be worse.  That's killing today.  That, you're killing.  All right.  Oh, that's just awful.  Doesn't it just sound horrific?  It just sounds horrid.  But don't you, I mean, you, what are you, you're. 
[00:18:30]  I remember when Jim and I were working on my show, and once we're about to go to, we're  about to start shooting, and he's eating in the scene, so I touch his food with my, all  over the place with my hands, because I know he has to eat it, professionally.  And he goes, are you kidding me?  I pay women to shit in my mouth.  You think I care?  Touch away, Lou.  I laugh at your fingers.  That was the funnest thing with Jim, was when we were whispering to each other before shooting,  anything disgusting I would say to him, he would top it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  One time I said to him, you know that AIDS started in your mother's ass, and he goes, yeah, what's  going to end there, too?  And then the bell rings, we're back.  All right.  I remember one time, one of my favorite things was, we were doing a scene in the, it was  me, him, and Mike in the bar area, the rest of the little diner we were sitting in, and  there was a chick playing a waitress in the day before shooting, and she had, someone bought  her a shirt, and you know like the clear plastic, long strip on it that will say like. 
[00:19:30]  The gap, large, yeah.  Uh-huh.  It would just say like a bunch of L's on it for a large.  Yeah.  She had it on her thing, and he said, on her tit, and she didn't know it was there,  and he said, all I want is for that to be there tomorrow when we shoot.  Nobody catches that.  Please let nobody catch that.  Just for her to shoot that stupid plastic clear thing on her.  Have you ever walked out of the house with one of those on your shirt?  Oh my God, on my pants, yeah.  Yeah, on the back leg of your shirt.  Absolutely.  Walked out of the apartment stores with that on. 
[00:20:00]  All right, back to Kenny, the dump report.  Where were we?  8.24 a.m., on his knees, pleasuring someone for a vial.  Anthony, about Voss needing money for drugs, on his knees, gave it too much detail.  Oh, it did not.  Come on, Al.  You gotta relax, dude.  That's really touchy.  Yeah.  I would love to see the station be fined for that.  It just wouldn't happen.  I've read transcripts of what the stations get fined for.  It's a lot more blatant than that.  Stop.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, I hear that, too.  What is that?  It might be the wireless.  Oh, I thought it was music.  Okay.  All right, go ahead, Kenny.  8.40 a.m., you can see that stuff in your underwear.  Voss talking about Norton and his STD test for syphilis and gonorrhea and how you know  if you have it.  Yeah, let's get into this, because as soon as you said that, I knew they were going to  dump out.  I'm like, come on, we've got to discuss this a little bit.  What do you see in your underwear?  No, when you have the clapper syphilis, you get a green drip in your underwear.  Oh, green drip.  You know what?  I'm glad they jumped in.  Holy fuck.  Well, I'm saying you could see it. 
[00:21:00]  You know that you have, that's why you go.  It burns or you have a discharge.  It's an infection.  What?  Stuff pours out.  Yeah, let's hear that one again.  Discharge.  Discharge.  So, actually, because it's green?  I guess.  I don't know.  No, you know.  You all too well know.  And it was in the back.  Olive green.  Yeah, it's horrible.  The burn.  You've had the clap?  Did I have it?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, please.  When I was like 17, 18, back then.  He laughs at the clap.  You didn't have condoms back then.  He's the one that didn't have condoms.  He's the one who coined the phrase.  No, you didn't.  He used to go to the clinic and you'd know people there.  Oh, you're back again and this and that.  He got the clap so much that they'd applaud him when he was.  That's how they started calling him the clap.  Yeah, Rich is back.  Hey, Rich is back.  Nice to see you again.  The worst.  He was making a boo for a while.  The worst was I lived with this girl and she was going down on me and I had the crabs 
[00:22:00]  and all of a sudden she sees this little crab moving and she's going down on me and  she flipped out.  I go, well, you're not going to finish?  I mean, you started.  Just get rid of, you know, you fling it off.  And those are the worst.  Fling it off.  Yeah, what's the big deal?  It's a crab, okay?  So you just get rid of it.  You know, you can't start giving someone head and stop.  Yes, you can.  I've had crabs three times.  Yes, you can.  You had crabs?  Yeah.  I had crabs once.  Did you?  Three times.  Wow.  Pretty awful.  God damn.  Scabies are worse because they burrow in the skin. 
[00:22:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  They burrow in.  Actually, when I got the crabs, a girl that I had just slept with called me and said,  hey, you have the crabs, you asshole.  And I was like, what?  And she said, I just realized I have the crabs, which means you gave them to me.  I'm like, fuck you.  You gave me.  We got no fucking fight out of the crabs.  Ever settled?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  And you probably knew.  I hadn't slept with anybody recently, so I know where I got them.  Well, but crabs is not like a VD or a clam or anything. 
[00:23:00]  You can get it from a, you know, toilet seat.  No one ever has, though.  You know something?  Yeah.  I've never gotten it from a bed or a toilet seat.  I've never gotten it.  Obviously, you never jerked off on a toilet seat before then.  Yeah.  You can.  Obviously, idiot.  As a kid, I jerked off on everything.  Everything.  Toilet seats.  You can get it from a bed.  You can get it from a bed in a hotel.  You can also get it from a girl or a prostitute.  Maybe you ought to look.  Did you ever get it from a bed?  Did I?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  This was years ago.  I don't remember where.  I didn't.  All right.  I'll tell you where I got it from.  A 19-year-old.  No, I was 19.  She was like 16 or 15, black girl.  And her pussy smelled so bad.  I could smell it.  We were sitting on my steps, and she was standing two steps away, and I could smell her pussy through her jeans.  I know.  It was like she was smuggling a fucking platypus carcass in her underpants.  It's fucking reeked.  I was smuggling this girl.  Her pussy was so bad.  I had to lean over the side of the bed, and I was dry heaving.  I'm not lying. 
[00:24:00]  Her pussy saw, I was dry heaving as I'm fucking her.  Right?  Didn't stop, though.  Well, thank God that I'm a bad fuck, and I would come quick.  This way, I killed two birds with one shot.  It was so bad, that fucking horrendous smell.  Here's the worst.  When you pull your dick out, and it reeks, and there's that fucking white slime on the base of your dick.  Oh, man.  That's a yeast infection.  Whatever it is.  Who knows?  That's probably why it reeks, too.  Yeast fucking kills a box.  Yeah.  When you fucking got that, and your pubes, that fucking white, caked up shit. 
[00:24:30]  Taste.  Like fucking Betty Crocker.  I was a vanilla dumper.  I picked up this fucking Mexican, and I was working Houston, and I'm, it was disgusting.  I'm fucking a little, ugh, Mexican.  Then she leaves, and I look in the bed, and there's a wrapped up napkin that she was using.  It's a fucking co-check.  I didn't know she was, oh, she had just wrapped a napkin, used that, and then went.  Yeah, I guess somewhere in a club, she put a napkin wrapped up as a co-check, and I felt  disgusting just from fucking her, and then I roll over, and I roll onto this bloody napkin. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, God.  Did you put it in your mouth and suck on it?  No.  Oh, man, that would have smelled and tasted it.  A little bloody burrito.  Like pennies.  What a history you have, and then you're mad at some girlfriend that wanted to blow you  whether there was a crab in your mouth.  A crab with a wine in her eyeball.  That's for your wildlife in your pubes.  Fucking an elk on your balls, and you want to know why she won't suck your cock, you selfish  asshole.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Club Soda Kenny is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, currently hosted by me.  We'll have more of this shit coming up after the break.  That's what was written for me.  We're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Um, you know who.  Louis C.K.  Jerking off goes to counseling.  Louis talks about jerking off in hotels on the road.  Louis talks about the couple's counseling he went to. 
[00:26:00]  They share stories about why relationships suck.  Oh, let's give a listen.  Broadcast with the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be on the radio.  Louis C.K. in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Describing life on the road as a comedian.  Oh, Jesus.  Describing jerking off.  Which is synonymous with life on the road.  You wake up around, I don't know, 11 a.m.  Wake up maybe.  And then you jerk off and go back to sleep. 
[00:26:30]  And then you wake up, put on the SpectraVision on the hotel, you know, watch 50 of them before  you find something that will get you hard so you can go on the internet.  You're not even jerking off to the shit.  It's spent about $1,000 right there.  You need a fluffing video.  Yeah.  And then to go on the internet, get some old pictures, fucking call phone sex, a few  different lines, fucking jerk off.  It's now like 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  I haven't seen daylight.  The drapes are all down because I sleep during the day. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  3 p.m.  I'm fucking hungry.  I get room service, go back to sleep, wake up at like 5.  Go to the shit mall, get a soft ice cream, watch a movie.  Go to the comedy club.  The manager says, how you doing?  And I go, I'm all right.  I just spoke my first words to a human being.  Do a show.  Up all fucking night because I slept all day.  Fucking nobody to talk.  Calling the West Coast because some of those people are awake a little later.  Jerking off and eating too at night at fucking 2 in the morning.  Oh, jerking off is just part. 
[00:27:30]  This is like the clock running.  You're just constant jerking off.  Calling people on the West Coast who I don't even know very well because I want to talk to somebody.  Anyway, times multiply this by two weeks or so on the road.  I retreat even more and more from people because I feel disgusting for what I'm jerking off to during the day.  And then I go home to my wife and it's like coming back from Vietnam.  I don't relate to my family anymore.  You wouldn't understand.  I'm Bruce Dern fucking taking off my clothes and walking into the ocean. 
[00:28:00]  I just fucking can't relate to society anymore.  Sell the car, sell the house, sell the kids.  Send that letter.  That Kurtz letter.  Just less and less able to fucking...  Colonel C.K.  Colonel C.K.  Nothing to say to her.  Oh, damn.  My wife is like fucking an astronaut's wife with a shaky cigarette in her hand.  He's fine.  We all love him here. 
[00:28:30]  Very proud.  When was the last time you saw your family?  You've been on the road for a while, right?  Yeah, well, this morning...  I'm in New York.  We're all in the city.  So I saw my family this morning.  My wife came into the city only because we had to go to couples therapy.  So she brought the kids.  Today?  We went yesterday.  You ever just yank your cock out and say, why don't you toot on this for a few minutes?  That's how you gotta do it, man, as a married guy.  Holy shit, that's a great idea.  How's that working out?  If I did that, she would just do whatever she was doing.  She wouldn't even look...  We don't look at each other.  If I took out my dick and said, why don't you toot on this for a while? 
[00:29:00]  She'd keep whatever fucking emailing.  She'd be looking at whatever real estate, wherever she wants to live when she leaves me.  She'd be like, I'm sorry, did you say something?  It would be nothing.  The counseling is obviously her idea.  Oh, no, I wanted to go.  You went for it.  Yeah.  I'm the one who said I wanted to go.  This fucking guy is...  We did it last time we went.  It was a double session.  It was $800.  Wow.  $800.  What does he do?  Eat both your assholes while he talks to you?  Jesus.  That's...  $800.  Wow.  Is it doing anything? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, it's great.  Everything's great.  It's great.  Everything's great.  Worth every penny.  It's fantastic.  Great, great, great.  $400 a person?  Well, it's $400 an hour.  He don't break it up by the person.  Oh, you go two hours?  Yeah, it's couples.  It's a driving movie.  He puts her in the trunk before he drives.  There's only one person here.  Listen up, honey.  Is there anything you could share from those get-togethers?  Well, no, not anything about us.  The guy, though, the first day, he's telling us about...  A lot of times, he'll tell you about other couples to give you comparisons.  And he's like, hey, I know a couple. 
[00:30:00]  Because I'm on the road a lot, and I work a lot.  So he's like, it's hard for people with careers.  I know a couple.  He's a lawyer, and he's a sports writer.  Right away, I'm like, I can Google that.  Make some connections.  Yeah, really.  I can figure that one out.  So while he's covering March Madness...  He's a lawyer.  He's a sports writer.  And then he goes, well, he's covering March Madness, and she's lecturing about pornography  and law around the country.  So I'm like, I know who these people are.  I can figure it out in 10 seconds. 
[00:30:30]  Why are you telling me this?  The next couple's going to come in, and he goes, I know a couple.  I know a couple.  He's on Starz and Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie.  The first initial and his name are L-O-U-I.  Fucking douche.  That's got to be something, though.  You ever sitting there and listen to a therapist or something and go like, he doesn't get this  at all?  No.  Well, the thing is, what happens in therapy is you really say the shit.  It's only because my wife, I know she doesn't have XM in the car she's in, that I can say 
[00:31:00]  that she's...  The other day, she said, I hate...  She pointed at my head and said, I hate him.  Oh, at the head.  Yeah, at my head.  Oh, yeah.  So here's the thing.  You get in there, and you fucking have it out.  You say everything.  And then you get addicted to that.  And you can say, outside of the therapist's office, you can say nothing.  Like, outside of the therapist's office, we're just...  Like, at home, we're just like, just bullshit talking about, you know, what did Rosie O'Donnell  say today?  Like, we can't... 
[00:31:30]  But if we start talking about anything real, it gets lightning rotted to what we fucking  have said to each other.  And if he's not there, we're going to kill each other.  Wow.  So we can only talk for one hour a week.  She said, I hate him?  One hour a week?  And we spend all the other hours of the week in this strange avoidance.  If we were in a boxing ring during the week, people would be whistling and throwing paper  and, ooh, do something.  And then for that one hour, oh, yeah!  Motherfucker!  It gets hot in there.  I don't...  Oh, shit.  I don't know how far we can take this, but why do you guys hate each other? 
[00:32:00]  Or can you discuss that?  What did you think when she said, I hate you?  What did you feel when she said, I hate you?  I hate you, too.  Okay.  Is it just over time, slowly but surely, the relationship broke down, or is this...  Oh, we got two kids.  I think it's like this for almost any marriage, except for that we have...  The thing is, we have a traditional marriage.  I make all the money, and she raises the kids.  But we have a traditional marriage in 2007, which means that you can't just say that.  Not traditional.  No, I don't get to say, I bring home the bacon.  Right.  You watch the kids. 
[00:32:30]  You fry it up in a pan.  Yeah, a pan doesn't work like that.  I bring home the bacon, I fry it up in the pan, I feed it to the kids, and if I mention  that I pay the bills, I'm a fucking asshole.  Like, I'm a piece of shit for, like...  Wow.  Like, somehow I'm being prehistoric if I'm...  But it's true that I pay the...  You know?  Yeah.  So it's hard.  Like, marriage is harder now, I think, than it ever, ever has been.  And it's not...  Like, this guy, he wrote a book, the guy we're going to, and it's all about how it's  hard for marriage now because the women work. 
[00:33:00]  My wife doesn't fucking work, so...  So your theory of your book goes out the fucking window.  Yeah.  It's hard, but mostly it's because when you have kids, it's hard to fuck anymore, and  you also care about your kids far more than you care about your spouse.  I don't give a...  I mean, my kids are my life now.  I really don't give a shit about her.  I really don't, because how could I next to my kids?  I'm laughing because I'm fucking stunned.  It's just like a stunning thing to...  The Odyssey. 
[00:33:30]  The Odyssey.  Well, it's true.  If our kids...  Look, I've got a lot of history with my wife, and there's a lot...  It's a complicated relationship, and I feel...  I couldn't...  You know, I feel a lot of push and pull in many directions, and I'm fighting really  hard to save it.  We're in therapy, and my whole life right now is focused on saving our relationship  and getting it back to somewhere good.  Oh, but do you want to save it?  So it's the biggest deal in my life.  But if my kids weren't here, I wouldn't even call her to say goodbye.  I'd just walk to the point.  I just fucking...  I wouldn't leave a note.  I would just stop being near for fucking time. 
[00:34:00]  So you're obviously fucking cancerous bodies.  You're saving it for the kids, then.  Totally.  100%.  That's why I'm so glad I never had kids.  Oh, my God.  Because the whole thing you're talking about, like, I used to get ragged on for not doing  things around the house.  I had these set chores to do.  There weren't much, but it was like, why I'm going out...  It's a new career for me, doing radio.  I'm really, like, learning the trade at the time. 
[00:34:30]  This was, you know, years ago.  And she's not working, and I'm bringing home the money.  And believe me, a lot more money than I was when we were both working, and I was knocking  tin.  But then...  Well, the money you brought in, just to help you out a little bit, gave her the luxury  of not having to work at it.  Yeah, not having to work.  Right.  Which is kind of key, I think, to this whole thing.  But then there'd be these little chores I would have.  Like, I'd have to take out the garbage, and it was my job to vacuum.  And, like, if I didn't do it, I would be ragged on.  Like, I remember my mother fucking yelling at me for not vacuuming. 
[00:35:00]  No, and the thing is, to me, if you don't have kids, I don't get any of it.  And that was it.  If you're married, and you don't have children, and you have a bad week, get the fuck out.  Why the fuck would you save a marriage that's stressful?  Right.  When you have kids, that's everything.  You can't...  You gotta stay together for the kids, because you gotta be...  It's not even that they need to have two parents to be together.  It's just that you want to be there for your children, because you fucking care about  them.  But it's...  You gotta look at it on the other side.  Like, the thing about having kids, too, is that spend one day, if you have kids, spend 
[00:35:30]  one full day with them where you're...  Like, every time I give my wife a break, I fucking totally realize what she's going  through.  It's fucking murder.  You want to kill everybody in the world.  When you're alone with kids and you don't have...  I mean, I have a job.  Even when I'm taking care of the kids, I fucking got my computer on my knee, and I'm working.  Like, I'm fucking writing a movie.  You're still working.  Yeah, I'll call...  Just to make myself feel okay about the fucking trap that children feel like on a given day, 
[00:36:00]  I'll call my manager and just say, what's going on?  And he'll be like, well, we just booked another own A date in Camden.  Oh, good.  You know, go read a story to my daughter.  You know what I mean?  Because I'm not sitting in a room reading fucking The Happy Hen, and nothing else is  going on.  I've got a show I just booked in Camden.  I'm putting it on my website.  There's people talking about me around the country, buying tickets to my shows, ordering  my DVDs on Amazon.  That helps me sit in a room and read to my boring little kids. 
[00:36:30]  Kids are...  But my wife has fucking nothing, except to focus on what a piece of shit I am, her dropping  cum into her and making people that have ruined her life.  That's all she's got.  So I actually completely see her side to it.  We are...  And what we found out in therapy is that we're trapped and that it's neither of our fault.  So how...  But that doesn't make us go, oh, okay.  The only solution is killing the children. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, that's it.  Throwing them into a garbage can and letting them die next to a rat in a milk carton.  And you two just, like, spur of the moment, laughing, heading off to the Caribbean.  Oh, my God.  We'd have a ball.  Just having fun like the old days.  I actually think if, like, when I picture that, if we got rid of the kids, I would walk  out the door.  Actually, what I'd do is fuck her face and we'd probably get a little crazy.  Why don't you guys go on vacation again?  Leave the kids with one of your parents for a few days?  And seriously, go away for a few days.  I want to punch you in the face for a second.  Is that bad?  Oh, shit.  Is that bad? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  It's just so complicated.  One of them, she's still breastfeeding the kid who's two.  Can't get the kid away from her.  No, it's a mess.  You never do that.  You never do that.  Wow, man.  It's like walking up to a guy in a concentration camp and going, why don't you just take a  little trip somewhere and get out of here?  If you don't like it here, why are you hanging around?  No, but you can't give them to, like, your parents or something like that.  Because there's Nazis that will shoot me in the face if I leave.  Two's too young to leave.  Wow, man.  Yeah, two.  No, we can't leave the kids.  Let's go to Minnesota, I think.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, love you, love your show. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, Louis, I completely agree.  To me, I think I'm just a dick for my wife.  And, you know, I'm just a dick in a house.  Well, that one lost steam faster than you expected.  Yeah, I know.  He might admit that he doesn't care about his wife either.  No, to me, I'm just a dick to the wife.  Hey, Jenny, got a question for you.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that. 
[00:38:30]  I did that.  Who is that?  That's his apology.  Hey, Dave, here's it now for embarrassing phone calls.  Let's try to get this back on the rails.  Yeah, go ahead, Dave.  Oh, no, Louis, you're absolutely spot on.  Same predicament here.  You just go numb, man.  But I'm at the point where I couldn't give a fuck if my wife went out and got filled up with somebody else's cop custard.  I'm done.  And don't give a shit, man.  I'm just holding on, waiting for the kids to graduate.  Get the fuck out, man.  I had my job.  Oh, no, if my wife cheated on me, it would change nothing.  Yeah.  It really wouldn't. 
[00:39:00]  You wouldn't leave her?  It would be leverage for just the little things during the day.  That's all it would be.  You wouldn't leave her?  No, because I can't.  I got plenty of reasons to do it now.  I got kids.  We want to stay together.  We want to have the kids.  And, you know, the thing is, the complex thing about it is that we share the kids, and that makes us happy together.  Like, we, as parents, we're fucking the best friends in the world.  We watch our kids do fun shit, and it's hugely rewarding to the two of us.  That's your common denominator there.  Yeah, exactly.  So, like, we'll be hissing at each other.  I hate you.  I'll never suck your dick again. 
[00:39:30]  Fuck you.  You whole fucking heart.  Oh, look.  Oh, look what she did.  Oh, my God.  Oh, isn't that cute?  So we do, but that joy that we share with the kids, totally real, and it's actually making life worth living.  So that's the thing that's complicated about it.  When I picture leaving, I'm not only sad to think of not being with my kids every day, which I am, I'm also sad about her.  She's part of that.  She's part of our...  You won't be able to share that with her.  No, and that's bigger.  And actually, you know, look, I'm almost 40.  My dick is finally starting to get 8% less hard than it used to be. 
[00:40:00]  So, like, the fucking joy of having a family is starting to outweigh the sex a little bit.  But, I mean, that's kind of sad, because it's like, you know, I'm not going to care that nobody fucks me in a couple of years.  Dude, I think you really...  Wow, that makes me want to kill myself.  You know what I'm doing when she's laying there sleeping?  Start eating her ass, like a fucking loon.  Go in there and start eating her ass.  She'll be like, this loon is...  She sleeps with the fucking children.  So I'd have to, like, I'd have to move my baby to the side.  Go like this.  If the kid looks at you, go... 
[00:40:30]  He inadvertently sticks his face in the baby's ass.  Wow, she's really, uh...  She's been working out.  She's toned up.  Let's go to Walter in Pennsylvania.  Walter?  Oh, hi, guys.  Love you, love you.  Hello, Walter.  Thanks.  Guys, look, I'm Lucy Kay.  I've been married 17 years.  I've got three kids.  My oldest one is 14.  My youngest is 10.  I've been in therapy for the third time.  We're together because of the kids.  She's a teacher. 
[00:41:00]  I've got a...  I'm developing a girlfriend.  You're developing a girlfriend.  I'm sorry, Louis.  I don't know what to say.  She's ignored me.  I haven't had sex in three years.  I get ignored.  I'm a local truck driver.  I don't know.  We're in therapy, and...  That's good, though.  You're talking about it.  And it's also good that you're honest about how long it's been.  Because whenever married couples, whenever married guys compare,  like, how long has it been for you?  It was somebody who goes, two months. 
[00:41:30]  And now we all have to say two months because you lied.  Why?  It's been longer?  Of course it has.  Two months.  What is your wife?  A whore?  That's unbelievable.  Two months.  Two months ago, I was thinking about what it was like two years ago.  When was the last time you banged?  I don't fucking remember.  Honestly?  I think it was my birthday of last year, which is September.  I actually think that's the last time that my dick touched vaginal fucking secretion.  Do you talk dirty?  What?  When you fuck, do you talk dirty?  Talk dirty.  What's your fuck like that's going to solve everything? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, it helps.  A whore, cunt?  No, no, no, no.  And so fuck you more.  But I mean, like, you might want to open up a new door.  Sometimes you open up a new door.  Yeah, sure.  We talk dirty at the supermarket.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  Sometimes you open a new door and you both get addicted to it again.  That's the way it is.  Yeah, but...  Was the sex awful?  No, it was good.  It was good.  Every time we've had sex...  We've never had sex where it wasn't fun.  We have good sex.  Why not more often?  Too much other shit going on.  So why don't you say, look, I want to get blocked.  It's like fucking in a war zone.  It's like trying to get blown into, you know, Iraq and pollution. 
[00:42:30]  You know?  Being shot at you.  Start losing your heart on when you watch people's heads explode.  You have no fear, man.  I like your honesty.  It's unbelievable.  She doesn't have exome.  You're so right about the no kids thing, though, because in my situation, I had the job.  That was my main, like, focus.  I had a brand new, exciting job that I always wanted to do, and that kind of made me stay  in the marriage for as long as I did, because that, I guess, you could equate to the child 
[00:43:00]  in the marriage was my job.  After a while, I started realizing, oh, my God, I am miserable with this woman.  I am miserable and have no reason to be with her.  And then when I found a girlfriend, the girl I'm currently with, I was given an ultimatum  by my wife who said, it's either me or her.  And I cannot tell you how fast I ran out the fucking door that day, went to the phone, 
[00:43:30]  called up my girlfriend and said, I'm coming over.  It's us.  It's done.  It's done.  It must have been awesome.  It was fucking awesome.  It was the best.  But her ultimatum didn't get out of her mouth, and it got me thinking, like, she actually  spurred it in my head.  It was like, yeah, it is her or you.  Well, that's the thing.  Why the fuck am I here?  Goodbye.  When you're in a marriage without kids, it's about each other.  It's like it's about this struggle of two people trying to figure each other out.  When you have kids, that just goes away. 
[00:44:00]  You start, you start, as a matter of fact, the difference between one kid and two kids  is huge.  Really?  Because one kid, you're both doing exactly the same thing all the time, that one kid,  which, by the way, deranges the kid's brain, because the kid is a fucking, like, her face  is like Beirut.  It's a battleground of two fucked up, war-torn people.  Factions.  But then once you have two kids, you split off, and then you start fucking resenting.  And, again, I totally, when I can put myself in her skin and go, I'm fucking killing that  guy when he comes home.  I mean, just shooting him right in the fucking face, because she doesn't even have any distractions. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, you get out.  Kate, why don't you just do this, Lou?  I fucking hate it.  I don't have kids, but why don't you just do this?  If you guys want to have sex, why don't you say, go in the other room.  Mommy and dad need some alone time.  Go in there.  That's a great idea.  That's a great idea.  Why don't you get her help?  What's that?  You're making a pretty good living.  Get her a little help.  Fuck her, man.  I need my money to buy porn at the fucking hotel and stay at the Ritz on the road.  You did tell that story.  She stays in the greatest hotel.  I stay at the best hotel in every town, because fuck her. 
[00:45:00]  And that has some kind of excuse why the money's not...  Yeah.  No, no, of course.  Look, she's a very...  She's an attachment parent.  Like, she sleeps with the kids.  You know, it's a very...  We have babysitters, but we never would have a nanny.  I hate the idea of, like, a nanny living in the house, but, you know, I've offered her  to have any help that she wants.  You should be on one of those kid shows where they, like, study you guys.  Oh, what, the nanny?  Yeah.  Or whatever, the nanny.  You know what?  The nanny show is fucking horse shit, fucking cunt feed.  Editing.  Which doesn't even mean anything. 
[00:45:30]  I just wanted to say cunt.  No, the thing is, if, like, we have a dog, we've had a dog trainer over, any new person  with treats will get your dog to do anything.  Right.  They leave, it's over.  Fucking nice lady with an English accent starts talking to the kids, and there's a camera around.  It's Mary Poppins, right?  Yeah, no.  It's Mary Poppins for a...  It's like sitting in front of a Mary Poppins movie.  When she leaves, it's all hell breaks loose again.  Hey, Mike in North Carolina, you got something for Louis C.K.  Hey, Louis, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, did you just say you're still breastfeeding a two-year-old? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, my wife is, yeah.  Yeah, have you ever been to a grocery store?  It's called Gerber's, man.  That kid's probably walking around by now.  What time are you going to cut that stuff off?  She eats other food.  She doesn't just drink breast...  She's two.  She'd have to drink, like, six gallons a day.  Oh, no.  She eats fucking hamburgers and french fries.  And just kind of washes it down with some tit milk.  Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?  It's comfort.  She does it for comfort. 
[00:46:30]  It's actually...  It's good to breastfeed kids for a long time.  There's nothing better than breastfeeding to grow a kid up confident.  It's good for their brain.  There's all kinds of shit, but it's taken too long.  All right.  Maria, two years is too long.  Maria in New York.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say how depressing it is.  I'm going to be a year married in June, and I hope it doesn't happen that it happens  to Louis.  When did he get married?  In June last year.  Oh, first time it's June.  We thought you said June, but then you amended it. 
[00:47:00]  It sounded like you said June.  Wait, it was...  What month again?  June.  She is a Latina.  She's very good.  Maria.  Maria.  And Louis is Maria.  Yeah.  De donde estas?  Donde estoy?  No, de donde estas.  I'm going to correct you.  Donde estoy?  Yeah.  Where am I from?  I'm from Yoroway.  Mm-hmm.  Taste it most in that language.  Yoroway.  Taste it most.  Tu madre es un muy grande chihuahua. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  I've never been there.  Faggot.  That's Spanish for Jim.  All right.  You're depressed.  I am.  I really listen to you guys because we are planning to have kids, and I just hope that...  That's the reason you listen to us?  No.  We help them come quick.  Are you happy with your marriage?  We are.  I am.  You guys get along great?  Yes.  And you're going to have kids?  Yes.  Great.  Good luck.  Enjoy.  Godspeed.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Vegas.  Mike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  I got something for you.  Put it like this.  I've been married for a long time, and my secret is you've got to have someone else on the side.  Someone European.  All right.  Good.  Someone with a hairy box.  All right.  Steve in California.  Steve.  Hey, Louie.  Guys, love you.  Love the show.  I got to say, you guys have two of the greatest therapists on the air.  You got the treats for the single guys, and Louie for the married guys, and then you  got Jim for a sex counselor.  That's true.  Louie, I know what you're feeling. 
[00:48:30]  I've got five kids, been married about 18 years, and, you know, actually, I do have  sex regularly.  My wife and I went through some struggles, and it was painful.  Her pussy must look like the hood of a sweat jacket.  With the strings pulled, so it's all pruning around the edges.  I'm sorry.  Anyway, guys, thanks.  Thank you.  Her twat must look like the fucking, an upside-down baseball cap.  It looks like...  You know, to me, the interesting thing is one of the... 
[00:49:00]  Because we know a lot of couples that have been through this time that are now doing well.  Really?  We know a lot of...  I've met people that have said what this guy said.  He's five kids deep.  He's still fucking, so he must have worked it out.  Does she make you laugh?  I'm amazed to think that this could work out and turn out to be okay.  So there's a point down the line where, supposedly, this works out.  Yeah, and that...  You're a bit optimistic.  Yeah, I mean, I know it's happened to other people.  That means not at all that it's going to happen to me.  You've got to do a show on 202 just talking about marriage. 
[00:49:30]  You're dedicated, but it's out of, like, selfishness.  Like, you're dedicated to this marriage, but it's out of selfishness because you enjoy the kids and...  Well, it's not like...  It's my responsibility.  I have to be there.  I have to be there for the kids.  I think the kids need me in their lives.  Yeah.  I don't think the kids would do well just with her.  So you're not...  Well, that's kind of cool.  Then it's not as selfish as it came off originally.  Did it come off as selfish?  No, I'm kidding.  No, maybe it is.  I don't know.  I might be very selfish. 
[00:50:00]  No, no, no.  I mean, I am.  I am a selfish person.  No, it just came off like the reason you're together is because you do enjoy the time with  the kids and the wife when you're with the kids.  All right.  Well, no, that makes...  But there are some people that stay together just based on the sanctity of marriage.  Well, that's horse shit.  The I'm not giving up on this.  That can suck my mother's bush all night.  I don't give a shit about that.  Sanctity of fuck you.  We'll get a couple more of that.  Chris and Philly, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  I went through basically the same thing Louie's going through. 
[00:50:30]  You know, I was like, yeah, I just want to stay together just because I have a daughter.  Then she became a real cunt.  I was like, all right, we'll go to counseling.  Maybe it'll work out.  Went to one counseling session.  And she's like, you're not into it.  You're just playing around.  You know, I was honestly trying to go.  I was like, all right, yeah, I want to stay together because of my daughter.  Now, she's like, we're done.  And that was it.  I was like, now she's being a cunt and trying to rape me for everything that I have.  Were you playing around? 
[00:51:00]  No, not at all.  I called her a couple times.  I was going through my computer.  And I said, let's see what she's been chatting about.  Went back in the chat logs.  Here she's talking to guys in Maryland.  Maryland?  Yeah.  Well, you know what they say about guys in Maryland.  Pants come off and the crab cakes come out.  Thanks, boys.  Punch it out.  Hey, Lou, does your wife make you laugh?  No.  Disgusting.  Does she make you laugh at all your wife?  Sometimes, yeah.  Yeah, she's funny.  She can be funny sometimes.  It's good.  All right, Jeff the trucker. 
[00:51:30]  Jeff, what's up?  I don't fart in the studio, by the way.  I don't fart about a year.  And, man, I'm already miserable.  I was a local truck driver for a while.  And she just completely changed when we got married.  Just, you know, ragging on my ass about everything.  Married one year.  He's miserable already.  Oh, man.  Well, you know, the thing is, any two people, you take two people and you put them in the  same house.  What the fuck are the odds that's going to work out?  There's just no way.  Like, it's this simple.  Like, the person you're married to will always disappoint you because they're not you with  a cunt.  That's what I want her to be, is me with a cunt and no beard. 
[00:52:00]  That's it.  I want to fuck myself.  I want to make myself wet and fuck myself.  That's all.  Anything short of that is a drag.  Your wife is a cunt.  Your wife is a whore.  You hate your wife.  I'm already going back on the road as an over-the-road truck driver, so, you know, fuck it.  I just, like, hell, I can see more out here than I can at home anyway, and it's better  looking anyway, so what the hell.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Shh.  It's Mrs. Jimmy. 
[00:52:30]  Hello?  Here's another guy.  He's only been married a year.  Greg in D.C., what's up?  Oh, hey, boys.  First time caller, long time listener.  Love everybody there.  Quack, quack.  Yeah.  Hey, everything everybody's saying is just so hitting home right now.  I just had a kid three months ago.  I've been married for a year.  Fucking knocked her up again by accident.

[01:19:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Brought to you by Halloween 2.  A Rob Zombie film.  In theaters August 28th.  The virus.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Jim Norton.  It's Comic Week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Louis C.K. was supposed to be hosting today's show, but unfortunately he died of AIDS.  But since Lou decided to just not take care of himself and drop dead, Club Soda Kenny will sit in his place.  Rest in peace, Lou.  Now, now, if you feel it, it must be real, just say me the word and I'm going to give you what you want. 
[01:20:00]  Time is waiting.  You've only got four minutes to save the world.  No hesitating.  That's what I got you, girl.  Time is waiting.  We only got four minutes to save the world.  Hesitating.  We only got four minutes.  Four minutes.  Now listen.  Your attention, please.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:20:30]  Hosted by Club Soda Kenny.  Let's begin.  We're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Um, you know who.  Louis C.K.  Forgot daughter's school bag.  Louis tells a story about how he forgot his daughter's backpack that morning.  Louis' wife calls him.  They talk about his conversation with his wife.  Louis tells stories about his daughter's life at school. 
[01:21:00]  I remember that morning.  Here's a little known fact.  I had to dispatch a trusted intern to deliver that backpack to his daughter at the school.  Believe it or not, but believe it.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Club Soda Kenny is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And, of course, Louis C.K. will also be there, and he's in the studio as well.  I love that.  It's his birthday, and he walked in just bitching and complaining.  I don't know.  You were supposed to be here a while ago, I think. 
[01:21:30]  I know.  What happened?  Bad morning.  Well, I walked my daughter to school with my wife on the way here, and, of course, my daughter won't carry her backpack.  She won't carry her own backpack because it's impossible.  It took forever just to get her to a corner where I could get a cab here.  And she keeps crouching her whole body to the sidewalk and just saying, it's cold, and I can't carry this, and I want someone to carry me.  She just won't walk to school. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  It's torture.  Isn't she 15?  Yeah.  15 in kindergarten.  And so I'm like, this is it.  This is life.  You've got to go to school.  Just go.  I didn't like it either.  Yeah.  And she makes me carry her backpack, which I carry.  There's no point to it being a backpack.  Because I carry it.  It might as well be a grown-up backpack.  A briefcase.  Yes, exactly.  Instead of a pink.  That's a shea case.  Hello Kitty backpack. 
[01:22:30]  Aw.  And so then I get to finally a corner where I'm soaked in sweat, and I get to a corner.  And it's my birthday.  Nobody cares.  Happy birthday there.  Whatever.  Absolutely.  The whole my birthday thing stopped very early in the morning.  Few gifts forget.  So then I get in a cab, and I get here.  As soon as I get here, I realize I have her backpack, of course.  Oh, boy.  Well, now how is she going to get any kindergarten work done without all of the tools that you  need to take with you to kindergarten? 
[01:23:00]  There's nothing in the back.  What is in there that she needs?  There's a folder in which they put notes for us.  That's all it is.  For you.  Her backpack is a mailbag for us.  Yes.  That's all it is.  And there's a water bottle, a little pink water bottle, which is there because they don't  give them water in the public school.  You've got to send them with water or else they die.  They just dehydrate.  Yeah.  So my wife, I called her because I had my phone off this morning.  So I called her to say I have her.  She goes, I know you have her backpack.  She's crying.  Come back and bring it. 
[01:23:30]  And I'm like, I'm at work right now.  And she says, so come back here and bring her backpack.  So?  Yeah.  That's not a thing you can say so to.  So once somebody here is being very nice from your show and going to bring it down to the  school.  But I called her to tell her that.  She's like, yeah, fine.  So it's not my birthday anymore.  It's not being my birthday.  I evaporated my entire birthday goodwill.  But your wife is now mad because you're not bringing the backpack to your daughter.  Even though you're making arrangements to have it dropped off. 
[01:24:00]  Even though I'm making arrangements to have it dropped off and I'm here doing what I do  professionally.  By the way, make sure we know who's bringing it because there are a couple of people on  our staff that aren't allowed within 100 yards of a school.  Yeah, I know.  I thought of that.  Depending on their criminal past or what they're carrying on them.  Who's bringing it?  Who?  Not Pat Duffy.  He's the one, yeah.  Probably can't go near a school.  Yeah, the fellow who brushed his teeth with dog poop.  And got thrown up in the face.  Yeah.  You've got to actually have a further education already.  Wait, that idiot. 
[01:24:30]  You should just stop in there and maybe learn something.  Happy birthday, Lou.  Oh, thanks, fellas.  Hope you're dead before the next one.  Hi.  You and me both, my friend.  That must have been a nice birthday for a couple of years.  September 12th.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, happy birthday.  Oh, the tragedy.  September 10th.  We had my birthday party early because I was flying to L.A. on the big one.  Yeah.  And I flew the night before to L.A.  But we had a big birthday party for me in our backyard. 
[01:25:00]  And my wife got me a piñata, which we...  Oh, look at that traditional.  The head of that piñata still hangs in our backyard.  Really?  It's just this symbol of the last normal moment.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's just this withering...  Or you're just a lazy Mexican.  Who doesn't clean up his piñata.  His own yard.  I bet you got some this morning, though, right?  A little birthday?  Somewhat.  Somewhat.  I don't know how it is on the old birthday.  You're going to need to go beyond innuendo for me to understand because I didn't get nothing 
[01:25:30]  on my birthday.  No.  I got a pen.  A nice pen?  It was a nice pen.  Just a cross pen?  Yeah.  There are nicer pens.  A cross pen.  A cross pen.  A pen on your birthday is good if it's sticking out of a vagina.  Hey, you can't say that.  But it's Wednesday.  But it's Wednesday.  You can't say that Wednesday.  Wait, the piñata, what was it?  Like Spongebob?  No, it was...  What?  It was a burro, you know?  A burro.  An authentic Spanish piñata. 
[01:26:00]  So we just make fun of your whole tradition when we...  Go ahead, man.  Get the Spongebob one for the seven-year-old.  We Americanize the piñata.  Yeah, but if Mexicans grew up with Spongebobs, they would use them.  They don't...  It's not like burros have some integrity.  No one says burros.  It's burro.  It's a burro.  It's a burro.  It's the burro of Queens.  We don't say burro.  It's the burro of Brooklyn.  The burro is probably correct.  Burro.  And what is that?  A bull?  No, it's the donkey.  No, it's a jackass.  It's an ass. 
[01:26:30]  It's a jackass, you burro.  It's an animal that's half, I don't know, half horse, half donkey.  Yeah.  It's a burro.  Are they the ones that are sterile when they're born?  Yeah, they can't.  They can't reproduce.  They can't reproduce.  They're a genetic dead end.  They can only make one by breeding like a...  It's a horse and a donkey.  Horse and a donkey.  Makes a burro.  Makes a burro.  It's a horse and a donkey?  A burro.  Yeah.  And then they can't mate with each other.  It's the only animal that has that.  It's a mutant. 
[01:27:00]  It's a mutant, yeah.  Wow.  A horse and a donkey?  Well, you know, I'm sure one is very happy and one is like, come on, all right, just hurry  up.  Yeah, I don't know who...  I don't know.  I think it...  Well, I guess it could go either way.  It has to be a male horse.  Why?  There's no way a female horse is tolerating some pesky donkey on a ladder.  What do you know about female horses in their...  Believe me, very realistic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just saying...  Yeah, the height thing would be a problem.  That's what he's getting at.  You think a donkey isn't as apt to be able to accept certain things than perhaps some videos 
[01:27:30]  you've watched?  It is.  It is.  A donkey is able to physically do that, but I'm saying the height difference in the donkey  Makes it a problem.  Yeah, like the horse has to be very patient and allow the donkey to put its stupid hooves up  and hoist itself and no horse is wading through that.  No horse.  Yeah, because usually horse sex is a much more beautiful act.  Yeah, it really is.  It's just this mess.  I know.  I don't want to...  It looks like... 
[01:28:00]  It's not clumsy at all.  No.  It looks like a fireman let go of the hose.  Yes.  That's always what it looks like.  It looks like a hose.  Oh, jeez.  Lost grip of...  Yeah.  Quick, turn that off.  It's going all over.  Can we get Pat Duffy on the phone?  I want to see how the backpack thing's going.  Well, he hasn't left yet because I got my wife...  Oh, here she is.  I got...  Hold on a second.  All right, boy.  Shh, shh.  Hey.  Oh, jeez.  So...  Bring it to Raquel in the office and she's going to bring it to the classroom. 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  So he brings it to Raquel in the office.  And what does he tell the guard...  What does he tell the guard when he gets there?  He tells the guard that he needs to get his backpack to Raquel.  Okay.  Look at him.  Her dad forgot to give her her backpack.  Right.  He tells us to bring it to the office and she'll bring it.  Okay.  I'm not sure, you know, he'll probably just sign a pass or whatever.  Right, he'll...  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  He'll sign the pack from here.  Okay.  Look at him.  All right, I'm really sorry about that.  Yeah, I know.  She must have gone nuts.  Yeah.  Of course. 
[01:29:30]  I know.  I know.  Thank you.  I'm really sorry, and I'll call you after radio.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Oh, wow.  Oh, dude, that's hysterical.  I think Lou was apologizing.  She didn't seem like...  She was like, all right, have fun.  No, she's okay now.  Yeah, she's all right.  You can tell.  I think a lot of it is me.  I think I fill in a lot of blanks with guilt. 
[01:30:00]  Because I'm listening to you.  She was just quiet.  She didn't say it's okay last time I talked to her.  So I'm like, oh, she's mad.  But she did have to explain to you the misery of the whole thing and how she had to get out  of the water and how she was crying and everything.  That was good.  Yeah, she didn't save me that.  I like that.  And no happy birthday.  No.  There was not a...  No, I love you.  Oh, by the way, happy birthday.  No, I love you.  Yeah, no, I love you.  Happy birthday.  Have fun.  You were looking at Pat Duffy, though, and laughing.  I'm laughing that this is the guy. 
[01:30:30]  Dude, he's got his forearm tat.  Yeah.  He's wearing his Honest Abe Lincoln beard.  Yeah.  His Amish beard.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a Frank the Tank shirt on with a picture of a tank on it.  Yeah, so you're going to an elementary school to deliver a pink Hello Kitty backpack to the  kindergartner right now.  You need to see a woman named Rachel.  He's taking it to Rachel's office.  Raquel.  Raquel, you don't know.  You aren't listening.  Oh, my God.  You aren't listening. 
[01:31:00]  Your wife is right.  I suddenly see her point in view.  Lou is an idiot.  I didn't hear a word of it.  He'd be looking for this Rachel.  I need to find Rachel.  They're, like, locking down the school, hiding the Rachels that go there.  He's going around every corner.  Rachel.  Rachel, I've got your back.  Back.  A lot of people pointing out that you're a beaten man on this feedback, Lou.  Oh, totally.  Oh, that conversation was just like, yeah.  Uh-huh.  I know.  Uh-huh. 
[01:31:30]  What were you hearing in your brain during that conversation?  You know what?  White noise.  Not Raquel.  Charlie Brown's teacher.  She was being pretty nice.  Yeah.  Considering that it's my birthday and I didn't do anything wrong, really.  Yeah.  And I just made a mistake and I'm rectifying it.  Yeah, you're fixing it.  Seeing all that, she was being pretty nice.  Well, you just said you were sorry twice.  I'm like, why are you sorry, Lou?  It's like, it wasn't...  I know.  I could hear her talking.  It wasn't like she was bitching at you.  She was like, yeah, she was...  You know how she freaks out. 
[01:32:00]  They were preemptive I'm sorries.  Well, they were from before, from the way she sounded last time I told you.  So they were owed.  I would never apologize like that.  I would just be angry back.  Yeah.  Well, you can't get through, you know...  You're probably right.  That's how Jimmy rolls.  Yeah.  That's how you act with a girlfriend.  You're right.  You're right.  There's no stakes.  Except P-U-S-S.  I'll leave the last one off for savings.  Puss is enough.  Puss is enough for a reason.  Yeah, not true.  Yeah, no.  You gotta... 
[01:32:30]  All right.  It's like the U.N.  There's some...  I'm trying to get a diplomatic solution to this war.  Look, he's wearing it.  He's wearing it.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That's kind of gross.  It's been fouled now.  It's like a guy wearing your daughter's panties.  Oh, yeah.  He fouled it.  Let me see the back of that.  What is it?  Hello Kitty.  Oh, it is a little Hello Kitty one.  It's adorable.  To get it off the pal talk, that's enough exploitation by the most disgusting.  Show on the face of my beautiful little daughter. 
[01:33:00]  I know.  And her bad day.  And her little Hello Kitty backpack.  Yeah.  Can we go through the backpack and see what's in there?  No.  I told you that's in...  I told you what's in there.  Yeah.  There's the water bottle here.  Turn around.  You see the pink water bottle.  Aw.  Yeah.  It's adorable.  And it's all sparkly.  That's nice.  It's got little sparkles on it.  I picked it out with her.  It's way too big for her.  Is it?  Yeah.  It looks pretty big.  It was a real father's job of picking something out  for his daughter.  Yeah.  And my wife was like, oh, it's awful big. 
[01:33:30]  And then the teacher said, that's really big.  Oh, you screwed up.  Yeah, completely.  What did you think?  I mean, look, it fits him.  It fits Pat Duffy.  You could actually use that.  It's very practical for him.  That'll be true, though.  If your daughter starts selling encyclopedias,  she can carry them all next thing.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know.  She's two.  Encyclopedias.  She's five, but anyway.  All right.  And if she takes a time machine back to the 50s,  sells encyclopedias.  Actually, people still do that door to door.  Do they?  No. 
[01:34:00]  Of course not.  They don't.  No.  Nobody does.  All right, Pat.  How far of a truck?  Don't tell exactly where it is or anything.  I give you money.  You know, miles.  About four miles.  By the time you get there, school's going to be over.  I know.  It's kindergarten.  No, it's still 45 minutes.  It's still three.  It's a whole day.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a major.  That's rough.  Totally.  It's a massive difference.  That's more time for you than your wife.  I went for like 10 minutes.  She's been home every day.  I mean, we went to preschool, but it was like you go,  you drop her off, and then you turn around. 
[01:34:30]  You go home, you take a dump, and go back and get her.  Yeah.  That's all it was.  Oh, she just started kindergarten?  She started kindergarten this last Tuesday.  How'd she do first day with it being so long?  Well, the first day was just till 11.  Oh, they kind of ease them into it.  And then till 3.30.  At 11, was she like, hey, what's the deal?  Well, she was happy.  She liked it.  They did a few fun things.  And then she grew up all at once in one phone call to me,  because I called her and said, how was your first long day?  And she always just says, oh, you know, fun.  Nothing. 
[01:35:00]  She says, I don't like lunch, and I don't like recess.  Wow.  And I go, why?  Well, at lunch, the teacher's not there.  I'm just at a table, which, imagine that.  And then she goes, and at recess, all the kids I know run away and play,  and I don't know where they go.  And then I just walk around and watch other kids play, and then I get sad.  Oh, my God.  That is the saddest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, my heart broken, too.  I wanted to kill myself.  Why?  Should have.  She just, now she likes it. 
[01:35:30]  She had a few days, and she found a kid.  Is she meeting people?  I said to her, go up to a kid.  I was having trouble with it.  And punch him?  Because she's having memories that I remember now.  Oh.  Like, up until now, when she was, you know, when they're three, you're like,  so what?  She won't remember this, you know?  They do.  I'll punch her in the face.  It doesn't matter.  They're going to wipe the hard drive in a minute.  It doesn't matter.  It starts recording at five.  Yeah, at five, you press record.  You know, you make a really good point.  It's really weird.  I don't remember anything before kindergarten.  No.  Nothing.  Nothing mattered. 
[01:36:00]  But now, she's going to have real memories.  But so I said to her, try going up to one of the kids before recess,  because recess is crazy.  Nobody's going to listen to you.  Right.  Go up to a kid earlier in the day and say,  can you tell me where you're going to play later so I can be there?  And I realized I'm doing what my dad used to give me way too grown up.  This is like office politics advice I'm giving her.  She's in kindergarten.  She's going to go, excuse me, Tiana, could you let me know where you guys are  planning to play so that I can interface with you? 
[01:36:30]  Because when I got beat up in school, my dad made me memorize a speech that I was supposed  to give to the kids that used to pick on me.  Wow.  It was a whole thing of you must respect me as your equal.  Oh, God.  I am not here for you.  That must have worked really well.  You know, I have a right to my own integrity as a person.  And he made me memorize it and say it back to him a bunch of times.  Who was your father?  The president?  That's like a presidential thing. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  No.  My dad's out of his mind.  He's Mexican.  Did it work at all?  I didn't do it.  Oh, okay.  Then it just became, I have to make my dad happy that I'm going to say this.  I thought perhaps, no.  But I'll never say it.  I am, I am owed my own space, my own dignity, just as you.  Oh, ow, ow.  God, stop.  Ow.  Exactly.  That's terrible.  We got to end this side of the show.  I wanted to get into that a little more.  That's horrible. 
[01:37:30]  Well, you know, for next time.  But she's making friends now.  She is.  She's making friends.  She found a friend and they play some hula hoop game.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, today is.  I think she's now shunning other kids.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think she should.  As long as she does it on her own accord, that's fine.  Yeah.  But if she's looking to play and the kids, like, run away and she's alone somewhere, that is heartbreaking.  That is really sad for a five-year-old.  Oh.  Unfortunately for her, today is show off your backpack and water bottle.  I think so.

[01:40:00]  because we were talking about shredders.  I have a shredder.  Apparently Patrice is a shredder.  Crosscut.  You like to shred.  Crosscut.  You've got to have the crosscut shredder.  I have a shredder.  I don't think I've got the crosscut though.  You've got to have crosscut.  You've got to have crosscut.  Why?  They can tape that shit right back together again.  I don't know how long that would take though.  For you?  What?  To steal your identity?  For you, yeah.  Nigerians?  Yeah, man.  Come on.  They're out there.  There's an African Opie somewhere.  I am Greg Opie.  On my point of view is people have stolen my credit cards 
[01:40:30]  and then they reverse the chart.  You know, I get the money back.  You get it back.  I'm white.  Everything works out.  It works out.  How long did it take?  Like two minutes.  Two weeks, you know, and then I go,  oh, by the way, could you reverse those charges?  Of course, Mr. CK.  Of course, Mr. CK.  We've done that already.  Yes.  Problem?  The best part during the break,  Louie's like,  and I'll go,  what?  I didn't buy that.  Yeah, you've got to take that off the card.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking a couple of my own purchases.  Yeah, just a couple of purchases.  Also, I would never buy an iPod.  Dinner?  Why would I have an iPod?  Dinner with my wife? 
[01:41:00]  I didn't pay for that.  Somebody took my wife to dinner on my credit card?  No, but I saw this comedian, Morgan Murphy,  in L.A., who did a bit about,  I'm just stealing her bit,  but at least I'm quoting her,  when they,  some commercial for Citibank  where they show a black guy saying,  they thought,  you know,  I saw something for a surfboard on my card,  and I called,  and they told me,  of course,  we already took that off,  and the message is,  wow,  here at Citibank,  we know black guys don't surf. 
[01:41:30]  Mr. Rodriguez,  of course we know you didn't buy those textbooks,  or whatever, you know.  Don't you get annoyed  when they check on you, though?  Oh, yeah.  Like, there are certain things I do  all the time  and use my credit cards for,  and then they'll like,  oh, it's been denied,  we have to call,  you have to call up  American Express or something  and make sure.  I'm like,  dude,  I've done this 15 times.  That happened to me  during this Christmas season.  Did it?  They shut off my card.  Why,  because you used it?  Oh, yeah.  Good point. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, no,  you shut your card off  and you go shopping.  They explain the whole thing  to you from scratch.  You're like,  well,  how do we know it's you?  Yeah.  Well,  because I signed it,  but anyone can use your signature.  Well,  why did you ever let me use this card?  Well,  then why am I,  yeah,  why am I allowed to do this?  Well,  we noticed you've made  multiple purchases in one day,  yeah,  at the same mall,  around Christmas.  I'm shopping.  When's the last time you've been asked  for an ID  with your credit card?  Yeah,  you don't.  Ever.  You don't get asked for an ID?  No.  Ever.  Just hand him the credit card.  Done.  Transaction complete. 
[01:42:30]  It doesn't matter.  Yeah,  insurance catches it all,  so it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  I had mine stolen.  You know,  Jekyll and Hyde's here in New York.  That's a great story.  Apparently some guy,  one of the waiters over there,  had this little device  in his apron,  and when he took your credit card  on the way to the register,  he'd swipe it into this device,  which later he plugs into his computer,  gets all the info,  and he had a thing  that prints up cards  and puts the information  on the magnetic strip.  Yeah.  So he used my credit card  to get like $800  and something dollars 
[01:43:00]  worth of cell phone equipment  and stuff,  and I called up Amex  and they stopped it  and reimbursed  and everything was done.  Wait, do you pay attention?  See, this is where I'm fucking up.  Yeah.  I'm so afraid  of what my balance is going to be.  You don't even look.  Do you open it up  and kind of shut your eyes?  I don't even look.  I don't fucking call my balance,  so it's like,  I don't know if somebody's...  You don't look at your charges?  No, that's the thing too.  I'm saying I'm afraid  to hear it go down,  you know?  I don't have enough  where every time I spend,  I know I'm spending,  so it's like I'm afraid 
[01:43:30]  that it's going down,  so I don't check it a lot.  Yeah.  So somebody could steal my shit  for a minute, you know?  See, I check it now.  I didn't used to.  I would just look at the balance  until I realized  I was paying for AOL  for four years  every month  and I hadn't used it  in four years.  I just hadn't used it.  It was like riding around  on a bicycle  with training wheels  still on.  I just never...  Like AOL was your first foray  into the internet  kind of thing,  but once you were done 
[01:44:00]  with it,  done with it.  You pay bills  over the internet?  Yeah.  Oh, I have porn sites  that fucking bill me monthly  that I haven't jerked off  to since the fucking 90s.  Since forever.  Yeah.  Like it's still...  People come in sometimes  for six bucks every month  for some service.  I don't know.  It's like gm2b.com  and you're like,  what the hell is this?  I don't even know  what that is.  Yeah.  But I might need it someday,  so...  Yeah.  That's funny.  Let it ride.  Louie's in the middle  of a 10-year contract  these times  with some porn sites. 
[01:44:30]  Keeping some company  alive right now.  I have no idea.  Is one guy still paying?  Let's keep the company going.  I watched Paris Hilton's video  blowing what's-his-name.  Yeah.  And that, yeah,  I paid for that for a long time  because I paid for it  just...  Jerked off to it once,  never watched it again.  Done.  And then like,  I don't know,  three years later,  I looked on my credit card  and I'm still paying?  Still paying.  Monthly.  Every month.  You gotta check the charges.  36 months I paid.  And it's a process  for you to get that shit off,  like to not pay. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, it's hard.  Yeah.  You gotta go to PayPal  and then reverse it  and you gotta send your code  and...  Sometimes you just have to  report the card as stolen.  Get a new one  and say you want a new number  and then they can't  charge that one anymore.  But then you gotta go  through the shit  and call them  the legitimate charges  and...  You gotta actually  call Paris Hilton  and say,  I don't want to jerk off  you anymore.  I'm done with you,  you whore.  Are you sure?  Get off the hook,  will ya?  Couple more,  come on.  Let's go to Dave in Vegas. 
[01:45:30]  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, the golden ticket  for not getting hassled  with your credit card,  U.S. passport.  Everyone accepts  the U.S. passport  as your ID.  Nobody...  We went in the wrong  direction here.  Nobody's having trouble  using their credit card.  It's that it's too easy  for others to use  your credit card.  Alright.  The golden...  I love that there's  a golden ticket.  A golden ticket.  I got it.  You show them a passport,  you don't even need  a credit card.  They just give you  the merchandise.  Let's say hi to Eric 
[01:46:00]  in Boston.  Eric.  Hey, yeah,  I did that  freecreditreport.com.  Oh, yeah.  And I got...  Apparently,  I got signed up  for a membership  at $13 a month.  They got me, like,  for seven or eight months  before I figured it out  and finally canceled it.  There are a lot  of services out there,  either on the computer  or some of these  TV services  like the one  with the chicks,  Girls Gone Wild,  that you don't  just buy something.  You're subscribing  to something.  So if you buy  Girls Gone Wild,  they show the tape,  you go,  oh, I called a number, 
[01:46:30]  I want that one.  You're all of a sudden  in this subscription-based  thing where they send  you tapes every month  and you're billed for them  and then you have to  box them up  and send them back  and they make it  real difficult to do that  and a lot of people  didn't realize that  and it happens with things  like Free Credit Report,  other websites  where you're signed up  and it comes every month.  13 CDs for a penny.  Yeah, that was the  original one back then.  It was great  when you were a kid,  though.  You'd send the penny,  you'd get a bunch of CDs,  screw it.  Mother kills you.  Yeah, well,  why am I getting this  from Columbia House? 
[01:47:00]  I used to have it  mailed to the neighbor's house  and then you'd get your CDs.  Is that what you would do?  Yeah, and then you don't  have to worry about  anything else.  Jack it up to a federal crime.  Nice.  Well, how about you,  Mr. Fucking Set  the Puerto Rican Murderers  to your neighbor's house?  To your neighbor's house?  On the fucking...  Well, you know,  I never thought of that.  Wow, what happens  if they go to that house  and murder the whole family?  Like, you're going to be  polite to those people.  Oh, I'm sorry,  we have the wrong house  that we were going to murder.  You can't murder  the wrong people.  Oh, they break in  and kill the family 
[01:47:30]  and my...  Oh...  Well, you've got to explain it now.  Now I've got the guilt factor.  But you've got to explain  what he's talking about  because that would happen  during the break.  You don't...  When you have a navigation system,  which a lot of people  are getting now,  it's easy to program in home.  They have a setting.  It says home.  Yeah, a picture of your house.  Yeah, it's a little house  and you hit the button,  your address is there,  it takes you right home  no matter where you are.  But the bad thing is  if someone gets a hold  of your keys to your car,  which usually has  the keys to your house on it.  Like a valet parking.  Yeah, valet parking,  things like that.  They hit home, 
[01:48:00]  now they know where your house is  and they have your house keys  and your car  to drive them  and your goods away.  So they're taking your car  for a joyride.  To your house,  to rob it.  You learned that  watching first Bueller.  Well, they didn't have  a nav system,  they just had a cool car.  That's pretty funny.  But it's true.  It's paranoid.  But if you put home in,  they know where you live,  so put home  a few doors away  from your home.  Show me one story  where that actually happened.  I've not,  but just because it hasn't happened  doesn't mean it might not. 
[01:48:30]  Or maybe it has.  It goes back to  Louie saying  plenty of kids  choked on  on toys.  On toys.  People who got killed  that way  are not around to  But now you got me thinking  that I put it  a few doors away  from my house  Now you're going to  get somebody murdered.  As home  because I get close enough  to my house  if I'm seven,  eight houses away  from my house  Why the fuck  don't you just put it  in the vicinity?  Don't you know  where you live  by that time?  Because it's a button  for home  and it's easy.  You don't have to just go  put it in a dress. 
[01:49:00]  It's one button.  That's why I don't have  an easy pass  I told you.  Because they know  where you were?  Because you like  sitting in fucking  a line of traffic  So you like  going into the easy pass lane  and then cutting into  the cash lane  so I can sit behind you  you motherfucker  If you speed  if you're going through  multiple tolls  and the speed limit  is 55  They don't send you  a ticket  Yes they do.  No they don't.  They're talking about  doing it  They were at some point  but they don't.  Listen, first of all  I'm getting tired  of both of you  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  I'm getting 
[01:49:30]  No no  I'm getting tired  of both of you  You'll have to be here  With your dismissive nose  and no proof  It's just like  everybody listens  to white nose  I'm saying yes  Yeah but the default  And both of you  just go  Nah  The default shouldn't be  In your case  default is paranoia  Everything that could  possibly  that your amazing  imagination can dream of  is going to happen to you  I've done 90  You think people should  spend calories  like thinking of  okay what if somebody  stole my cell phone 
[01:50:00]  while I was sleeping  took out the chip  shoved it up my ass  and used it to find me  so they could  rape my mouth  with something  they stole from me  when I was eight  And at this point  It's very easy  You gotta look out  for that kind of thing  At this point  It's very easy to say  no to you  because you came up  with that Crisco oil  thing an hour ago  Yeah that's true  You hurt your own  But people have heard  about the easy pass  situation  I have driven  between easy pass  stations  doing 95 miles an hour  And you've gotten  Nary a ticket 
[01:50:30]  No I've never  gotten a speeding ticket  How many times  am I going to say  we're white  we can do whatever  we want  You get  speeding tickets  because  there's a W  on my statement  Have you checked  your license points?  Yeah  I think you better  check them again  Dude my license  is squeaking  You think they're  just stealthily  upping his license  points without  telling him why?  That's black  You don't think  I would get  something in the mail  saying go to  Yeah  You get pulled  over for no reason 
[01:51:00]  Right  It's a new magazine  Again  Patrice  You get pulled over  for no reason  because you're black  That's how the  fucking country works  That's the way  it's always been  So we have no reason  to be paranoid  the way you are  I understand  Your lack of  Let me tell you  No my lack of  need of paranoia  Let me tell you  what white guys  are now  You're becoming  the women  of the  Oh my god  Because you're  not working hard  at this moniker 
[01:51:30]  that you have now  You're not  You're lazy  You think it's  all about you  and I'm telling you  It is about us  The whole country  is based on  white guys  having a good time  and not worrying  But they're not  First of all  At your expense  It's coming  crashing down  In England  Yeah  You're a piece of shit  because you're a  ginger-haired  fucking pofter  I know that  That's why I don't  live there  I know  I would never  live there  In England  I run shit in England  if I go over there  with fucking  Do you?  Not really  They don't like you  Let me tell you  something  Ginger-haired 
[01:52:00]  Just polite  And he's a  ginger-haired yank  A ginger-haired  anybody  over in England  That's why  I don't go over there  A foot in the  fucking ass  Really?  Absolutely  Yeah I know  Because I  That's why I'm not there  That's why I'm here  We're just having  skin that's relatively pale  It's a huge advantage  A huge advantage  To the point where  it's criminal  how great my life is  It's a global crime  how good my life  is compared to yours  You have a slight  niggery texture  to your hair too  I know  It's a little niggery  It has a niggery texture

[01:54:30]  Because they looked at me  and they're like  He'll pay for something today  It'll eat out  He's contributing to the economy  It's going to be fine  When did you start  saying I'm a white guy?  What?  At what age would you like  You know what  Fucking I'm white  Call me white  I don't know  I look white  Well white  White is a bullshit identity  It's not a real identity  I have nothing in common  with other European white people  But  I mean at what point  did you go  I'm not fighting  to be Mexican anymore  Like I'm not fighting  for this whole Mexican thing 
[01:55:00]  What do you mean  fighting for it?

[01:55:30]  Hello everyone  I'm now a white man  No the thing is  I was white in Mexico  Here's the thing  that people don't understand  is Mexico is just like America  It's made up of some black people  and some white people  and brown people  The only difference is  they didn't genocide their Indians  as well as we did  Yeah  In the United States  We got that job done  Yeah  So that's why  the face of a Mexican  to most people  And also Mexicans  You meet Mexicans  that look like me all the time  but you don't know  they're Mexican  when you're meeting them  Fuck  Only the brown guys  I hope I don't say  bad things all the time  You probably do  I probably do  People say  Well I live in LA

[02:03:00]  and that has to  be assessed to a  driver for the  points  and not just  the vehicle  That's why you  That's why you  don't get points  when they take  the snapshot  They don't put  points on your  license when you  get a snapshot  for going to  a red light  What about the  red light situation  No points  just fine  But you still  can get a ticket  for the fucking  Somebody can  take your easy  pass  and speed with it  That's why  they can't do that  A parking ticket  you get  the actual  vehicle  gets the ticket  which is a  registered owner 
[02:03:30]  But in the  situation of a  moving violation  those points  it's a moving  violation  so the driver  has to be  identified  That's why  they have to  be stopped  Anybody could  be driving  your vehicle  I'm telling you  Patrice  it's you  The reason  you're getting  speeding tickets  in the mail  is because  you're black  and they got  tired of pulling  you over  You know how  cops used to  pull you over  all the time  Well now they  just send you  the ticket  in the mail  and you pay  and you don't  have to do  the whole bullshit  Did you buy  this car yourself  You know boy  You too

[02:08:30]  my wife  my children's  mother  What is that  about Louie  My children's  mother  My baby  mama  was standing  in the front  lawn with  a dog  and there  was a deer  across the  street  just staring  at the dog  was barking  and she said  get out of  here to the  deer  and the dog  thought she  said go get  her  Oh boy  And so the  dog ran 
[02:09:00]  across the  street and  the truck  hit her  and wrecked  destroyed her  life forever  How old was  the dog?  The dog was  nine  and she was  killed  and I  loved that  dog  I mean I  traveled  I have that  YouTube video  of that dog  that people  watched  and I  traveled across  the country  with the dog  like six  times  Wait that's  the dog?  That's the  dog  Now I'm  affected  I thought  the dog  was really  kind of  adorable  Roland wasn't 
[02:09:30]  here to  give us  condolences  That was  a great  dog  I went  I actually  traveled upstate  because I  wasn't there  to see her  body and  put her in  the oven  which is  really weird  Why would  you do  that?  Because I  felt terrible  that I  wasn't there  and I  guess I  wanted to  have some  closure or  something  and I  didn't know  how I  would react  but once  I was  in this  room  with  incense  burning  they  gave me  a viewing  of the  body  It was 
[02:10:00]  ridiculous  I  just  sobbed  like a  baby  I  just  sat  there  and cried  like a  big  spaggot  What the  hell?  I thought  we were  getting a  joke  from you  today  Yeah  no  sorry  my dog  is dead  and it's  really sad  Wow  The dog  died right  on the spot  right?  There was  no like  Oh yeah  it had to  It depends  on where  the dog  got hit  No no  she died  she was still  dying when I  saw her  but we were  like we put  her in the  oven anyway  we were like  nah nah  there's no  chance  Put her in  the oven  anyway  She was still  alive  I just  thought  fuck it  you know  she died 
[02:10:30]  instantly  and uh  yeah  It's weird  to shove  your dog  of nine  years  into an  oven  Were your  kids  standing  right there  too  or no?  My  what?  Oh yeah  I had my  kids  stand there  and watch  No no  were they  on the lawn  when it  happened  with your  ex-wife  No they  were in  the house  but they  heard my  ex-wife's  blood  blood  curdling  scream  Oh fuck  man that's  awful  It's uh  it's rough  to lose a  dog  Did I ever 
[02:11:00]  tell the  uh  the Brett  dog story  on the  show?  No  Which  dog story?  I wish  you were in  studio because  I completely  feel for you  completely  This wasn't  Fresca right?  No  No it's a  drag  Dogs are  with you  when you're  alone  You're alone  in their  company  Nobody else  can really  do that  that can  keep you  company  but you  don't have  to say  a word  to them  for hours  It's like  E-Rock  You want 
[02:11:30]  Do you want  me to tell  this story?  I'd love  to hear  the dog  story  This deals  with real  emotions  and so  you know  I'll try  because I  mean  you know  Louis has  set us  down this  path  I've never  told this  story on  the air  I'll try  not to  choke up  so  just go  from the  part where  you kicked  it in  the liver  No  no  no  no  no  This is  my brother's  dog  it was  his life  a black  lab  Oh  they're  adorable 
[02:12:00]  It was  his life  and  we  came home  from my  uncle's  wake  and I'm  laughing  because this  is so  horrific  so it's  my dad's  brother died  unexpectedly  horrendous  horrible  and we're  all just  kind of  at our  own  houses  just  depressed  went through  this whole  wake thing  and I get  a phone  call from  my mom  screaming  bloody  murder  and I'm  like  oh my  god  what  happened  to dad  I'm  thinking  this caused  maybe a  heart attack 
[02:12:30]  or something  and she  goes  you better  get over  here  I can't  console  Brett  I go  what  happened  to  Brett  well  his dog  got run  over  by a  car  my dad  who just  came from  his own  brother's  wake  ran in  the street  and at  that time  he was only  living on  one artery  picked up  the 80  90 pound  dog to  get him  out of  the road  this is  the type  of father  I had  like I said  I had real  emotions  coming out  here  and then  the dog 
[02:13:00]  died in  my dad's  arms  and he  put him  kind of  in a  wheelbarrow  just off  to the  side  because it  was the  dead  of winter  it was  like early  February  just a  horrendous  winter  night  snow on  the ground  full moon  maybe  8 degrees  out  maybe  I go  over  and  Brett  is  I can't  I can't  there's  nothing he  could do  he's on  the floor  on all  fours  just crying  and going  why  why  why  why  and  inconsolable  right  and we  get him  in a  place 
[02:13:30]  and he  looks at  me  and he  goes  I gotta  bury  the dog  now  and I'm  like  what  so we  take the  wheelbarrow  with like  his life  basically  and we  go into  the backyard  and I  thought I was  in the  middle of  a horror  movie  we are  trying to  dig a hole  in my  parents  backyard  for his  dog  it's  8 degrees  out  and as  he's  like  digging  he's  collapsing  because he  realizes  what he  needs  to do  collapsing  and I'm  sitting there 
[02:14:00]  like oh  dear god  and I'm  holding the  flashlight  over this  shallow  grave  as he's  attempting  to try  to dig  it deeper  so he  can bury  his dog  like the fact  it made him  dig in his  grave  instead of  giving him  the flashlight  selfish  bastard  look I'll  go with  you  but that  grounds  hard  yeah  I think  the dog  would have  done a  great job  digging that  grave  we had  one of  those moments  though  me and  my brother  and he's  just digging  away  and I did  try to help  by the way  but it was  all about  he needed  to do  this  and I was  there just  to support 
[02:14:30]  as best  I could  what a crazy  need for  closure  to actually  dig a hole  and stick  it spot  and stupid  me  all of a sudden  the flashlight  flashes onto  the wheelbarrow  and it wasn't  a pretty sight  I'm like oh my god  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  and that got him  going again  it collapses  it took hours  we're out there  in the dead  of winter  like a horror  movie  burying his  dog  when you really  dig a hole  like that  it's like  there's roots  you gotta  cut through  oh my god  yeah  you know  Indian pottery  and whatever  and steam 
[02:15:00]  no  when the dog  died  my ex  called me  screaming  I mean  screaming  and sobbing  and making  no sense  and I thought  one of the kids  are dead  like I actually  my first thought  because I couldn't  make any sense  of what she was  saying  she was screaming  sorry  sorry  and I heard  dead  somewhere in there  right  and my first thought  was let it be the dog  I hope my dog  is dead right now  oh my god  compared to one of the kids  being dead  yeah sure  but for a moment  you weren't sure  oh I wasn't sure 
[02:15:30]  I mean I had  I had a sick feeling  I'll never forget  like somebody  I mean she's really upset  and somebody's dead  and I hope it's the dog  and then I hear the dog's name  I'm like okay  either the dog ate  one of the kids  or the dog's dead  right right  but the worst part  is telling the kids too  I have a six year old  and a three year old  and I was on the phone  with them  and they're crying  oh my god  and then the six year old  says  first of all  she says  I'll never forget her  and then she said 
[02:16:00]  she was like a sister to me  about the dog  oh my god  Jesus Christ  when she said that  I almost said like  Jesus  right  come on man  right  sensitive little story  I gotta tell you  where my parents  used to live  in Centerport  was on a main road  and  no joke  I moved home  from Buffalo  with a cat  that got hit by a car  and that was  in a weird way  in my life  because I was all  by myself in Buffalo 
[02:16:30]  and it was like  it was just  I had this  attachment to this cat  and my dad  picked it out of the road  and let the cat die  in his arms  and wait till  it got stiff  and then  he buried the cat  before I came home  from  I was working at BAB  at the time  and then  I can't even tell you  how many pets  your poor father  has to go out on the road  and pick up dead animals  dude  we lived on this main highway  and we always had dogs  but we never had  get a fish  we never had a fence  I know of at least  two more dogs  that ended up dying  outside our house  it's like a pet cemetery 
[02:17:00]  in my parents backyard  he comes out in the hood  you know  it was a relief  when you know  one of our pets  died of old age  and dad took the ride  you know  you know he's just  dumping him in the woods  somewhere  but he's like  no I took  I took Sprite  to live on a farm  in New Hampshire  but dad  you've only been gone  45 minutes  and there's dirt  on your pants  right exactly  Sprite  I was supposed to go  into an uptempo  god damn number  after talking about  a god damn dog dying 
[02:17:30]  no it's funny  and I'll let Jimmy  have his moment  in one second here  but what's funny is  someone's writing  Louie  will you turn down  your GPS  we're having some  real emotions  on this show today  and all we hear is  turn left  in one mile  I know  I heard it  I'm sorry  I turned it off  as quick as I could  I gotta go back  to Jimmy  yes Sprite  we decided to name  our pets after  soft drinks  I had one called  Sierra Mist  I couldn't have Sprite  we had Fresca 
[02:18:00]  we had two major cars  after automobiles  we had Pepsi  we had Shasta  which wasn't a very  popular soda  but we decided to  name one of our dogs  Royal Crown  I remember when  Mr. Pib died  you notice how many  dogs I just named  yeah  that's too many dogs  for one childhood  so guess what  was going on  a horror show  in front of our house  every three years  we have a fence  but it's an invisible fence  that's buried in the ground  and the dog  wears a collar  right  really works  that shocks her 
[02:18:30]  in the throat  when she crosses the line  but you know  they don't wear the collar  after a while  they don't need to  because they think  they don't understand  it's the collar  they just think  that God hurts them  when they cross  a certain line  well at least  she lived a good life  yeah  but she hadn't worn  the collar  for like five years  and she was a little  a little soft on the line  and also she was so  she was so certain  that her  you know  woman of her life  wanted her to chase  that deer 
[02:19:00]  right  if you think  I hate a deer  then now though  I want to fucking  kill a deer now  very badly  why the deer  was just minding  it's business  getting chased  fuck that fucking deer  no it wasn't  it was standing  right across her line  knowing that she  couldn't cross it  just standing there  looking at her  making her bark  it's a deer  not Saddam Hussein  it's worse  I'd rather fucking  fuck Saddam's  open throat  where the head  used to be  and feed a deer  no I hate  I hate that  but uh 
[02:19:30]  no it's a dragon  I like to sound  funny and ironic  no you know what  I think the show  could go down this road  every once in a while  now how did you  get through it  with the kids  um you know what  I was really proud  of my kids  because they really  they did what  you actually  wanted kids to do  they really  really processed it  and cried  and uh  and they know  she's gone  like uh  we said you know  maybe she's in a  better place  and the six girl  said no  she's gone  she's dead  doggy heaven  and here's the thing  though  I take her to school 
[02:20:00]  and I told the teacher  her dog died  and she's  you know  she's dealing with it  she's okay  but uh  just so you know  and so she gave her  a book that says  dogs go to heaven  and it talks about God  and I'm like  you fucking idiot  I had her facing death  and being okay with it  and you just fucking  put in the fairy tale  she didn't need it  yeah you gotta give him  the harsh reality  I'm thinking  no yeah  cause she was okay  she was like  yeah she's gone  I miss her  I'll never forget her  I'm glad she didn't  get old and sick  but I'm sad she died 
[02:20:30]  these are all things  the six year old said  she really processed it  right  but uh  but this teacher now  wants her to think  she's in a place  where there's bowls  of delicious dog food  yeah it's  it's weird  because when my dad died  my sister decided  and I'm not saying  it's right or wrong  I'm just  you brought up  another thing  I can relate to  my sister  had the kids  like release balloons  for pops in heaven  and they do that  on his birthday  and all their holidays  and I'm like  that's kinda nice 
[02:21:00]  but  yeah  I don't know  if pops  yeah I don't know  if pops is ever  gonna really  see that balloon  no cause balloons  burst when they get  to a certain point  in the atmosphere  they get to  a few thousand feet  you know what  but it's  I guess it's how  they deal with it  because they  you know  they know  something's not right  so they release  a balloon for pops  I guess if it  helps  whatever  I have an electric  collar around  my father  so far  electric fence  yeah  it's weird 
[02:21:30]  when you go  to a  what do you call  it  a cemetery  to jerk off  on all the graves  and stuff  and people  that bring stuff  and they're really  tacky  like mylar balloons  and shit  right  yeah  just people  that are gross  and tacky  about the death  of their loved ones  my grandmother's  grave Louis  they put a big  horseshoe  like she won  the Kentucky Derby  I love the  obituaries 
[02:22:00]  sometimes you  read through those  and it's like  happy fifth  anniversary  in heaven  what the fuck  first of all  is he getting  the paper up there  I uh  you know  exactly  like yeah  look at this  I hope the fucking  worms in your brain  are enjoying  your anniversary  I need  I need to take  everything in  and go to the limit  with everything  so uh  we had a relative  that died  I don't want to  mention which one  and uh  it was  it was  three days a morning  like you walk around  like a fucking zombie 
[02:22:30]  and and you do it  for other family members  if it was up to me  I'd be long  I wouldn't hang out  with anybody  because it's the  it's the weaker people  and I  and I  I use that term  very lightly  because your emotions  are what they are  but it's the weaker  people that bring  everyone down  to a place  you know  you don't want to be  like you're dealing  with it on this level  or don't need to be  but then you get  someone in the field  oh my god  oh god  going over  and you're like  why do I have to go  down to their level  like this sucks already 
[02:23:00]  that's why  that's why  I don't  I don't  I hate those things  where you walk around  like a zombie  for three days  and then the thing's over  we go to the uh  the uh  the cemetery  and we have the ceremony  where everyone puts a rose  on the casket  and it's beautiful  and the sun is shining  through the top  of this area  they give you  and it's  it's  it's  it's a beautiful  last moment  basically  and everyone takes  their time  putting the rose  on the  on the coffin  and you leave  and they go  now this concludes  the uh  the ceremony  and that's your cue 
[02:23:30]  to go  go to a restaurant  and get food  with the family  right  and I go to my brother  like screw that man  let's see what happens next  you know  and everyone goes back  to their cars  and we're lingering  lingering around  and we uh  we see in the back  out the back door  of this place  like no joke  four or five Mexicans  waiting with shovels  that's the reality  they can't wait  to get the damn  picking up the roses  and giving them  to their girlfriends  they're like  how much longer  is this gonna take  we wanna  you know  to them  they're waiting  for lunch  and that's the reality 
[02:24:00]  four guys  on a pile of dirt  with shovels  you know  waiting to bury  the damn thing  they're just gonna be  sitting there  talking  they're just babbling  and waiting  like ugh  alright well  the last person  has hit the car  let's uh  throw the coffin  in the ground  amazing  here's one  I think a lot  of the people  at funerals  who make a big deal  out of it  are performing too  I mean a lot  of people enjoy it  yeah  I think  I mean even  my daughter  said uh  she didn't want  to tell any  of her classmates  but then she said  I'm gonna tell  Ava  or one of her 
[02:24:30]  best friends  right  and when I  picked her up  from school  she was kind  of excited  like I told  Ava  and I told  Maya  and she got  to be a celebrity  cause her dog died  wow  I remember  as a kid  wishing that  my parents  would die  so that the  whole school  would be really  grieving for me  and I would  get paid attention  to  it  it was like  a nightmare  as a kid  and get to  like hold a press  conference  that my parents  died  yeah  you know  and cry  in front of the  class  and the girls  the cute girls  would feel bad  for me  let me suck 
[02:25:00]  your tiny penis  you don't even  know what that  is yet  you're twisted  man  that death  thing  when you're  a kid  do you remember  does anyone  remember the  day they  realized they  were gonna die  how horrific  of a feeling  that was  cause you went  from like  just enjoying  like school  and whatever  riding your bike  collecting baseball  cards  whatever the  fuck you're  doing  to the day  you realize  you have that  in your memory  like  one day  this what  one day  this all ends 
[02:25:30]  and then  it doesn't  go away  till you die  pretty much  you learn  how to deal  with it  a little better  I guess  as you get  older  but that  first time  you learn  that this  will end  is a  horror  and I learned  when  my parents  were going  out for the  night  somehow  it came  up with  my older  sister  as they're  leaving  to go  to a movie  and dinner  and I'm  now in  the house  without mommy  to like  help me out  you know  what  I found  out that 
[02:26:00]  you people  everybody dies  and I told  this kid  that was a year  younger than me  Benji  across the street  from me  this kid  who I kind  of hated  and I told him  you're going to  die someday  we all are  and he said  no  he started  screaming  no  and I said  yes  you're going  to die  everybody does  and so his  mother came  over  he went  home  screaming  and she  came over  and said  what did  you tell  him  and he's  with her  and I said  everybody dies  and she goes  that's not  true  wow  she had to  lie to him  I said  what  and she says  it's not true  not everybody  dies  his mom  wow 
[02:26:30]  what a lying  bitch  yeah  and I said  and I  I was little  I was in first grade  so the way I argued  I said  well what about  all the presidents  are dead  like Abraham Lincoln  and she said  well he got hurt  somebody hurt him  that's why he died  right  and George Washington  got sick  but some people  never die  that's quite a thing  right there  so I would have  pulled that kid aside  and go  and you won't go blind  either  don't worry  he's lying  now Louis  do you hate  the ex  do I hate her 
[02:27:00]  yeah  no I can't  she's my kid's mom  so I  well what kind  of feelings  do you have  toward her  considering she  sort of  might have  made the dog  do this  technically  oh I feel bad  for her  that she thinks  that  that she  feels like  she killed the dog  but of course  there's a tiny bit  of me that  thinks it's hilarious  that she's got  to deal with that  yeah  when she sleeps  at night  you're sick  faster  yeah it's a weird 
[02:27:30]  thing because  when you  what you still  share  having kids  and so there's  a lot of  you know  you know  a lot of great  things in life  that I can only  share with her  right  and she's my  least favorite  favorite person  on earth  right  it's like  if you  and  if you  if you  and Hitler  got a puppy  together  and  then he  goes off  and starts  his Hitler-y  life  and you're  like  and you're  Jewish  and you're  like  god  that guy's  a fucking  asshole  but  only he  knows  how cool  that was 
[02:28:00]  getting that  puppy  there you go  we just lost  a caller  it's something  that I think  Anthony brings  up on the show  the roadside  memorials  yeah I hate  those  that's another  drive down the  highway  and there's  a cross  with a picture  on it  and flowers  and notes  and teddy bears  laying next to  a tree  with like  an 18 inch  chunk of bark  taken off of  the thing  right  and you just  know someone's  head went right  through the  windshield there  oh yeah  they don't even  clean up the skid 
[02:28:30]  marks leading to  the tree  with the cross  on it  they should put  those things  down flat  yeah  it really is  like when you  see skid  marks end in a  memorial  yeah  it's like  the memorial  is what happens  when the car  hits it's weird  like what if  you hit one of  those what if  you fucking hit  one of those  and died  one of those  memorials  yeah  that would prove  no if you  if you make  one of those  you didn't  I don't  you're just a  fucking asshole  that's such a  embarrassing  thing to do  to the person 
[02:29:00]  who died  and it's  tacky  and you didn't  really love them  you're just  showing off  well people mourn  in different ways  I guess  I don't really  care I just  don't want to  see it so if  you lay it  down flat  on the ground  you know the  person knows  it's there  and they can  go visit it  whenever they  want  I actually  put a mannequin  of the person  yeah  and like I put  like a plastic  car bumper  like wear a  hit on their  body  and I play  music 24 hours  a day  that's how I do  you know when  somebody dies  and people  go and have  a candlelight 
[02:29:30]  vigil people  who didn't  know them  that's so  enraging  I can't  I just want  to punch them  and you see  them crying  like you didn't  know that it's  a person  and you're  standing there  with your  fucking mittens  holding a candle  with paper on it  yeah you do  realize they  might have been  an awful person  when they were  living  it's showboating  yeah  yeah it's showboating  exactly  we got Louis  on the line  and who's this  Michelle  hi Michelle  you're on  with Louis C.K.  who's bringing  the whole  goddamn show  down today  of course  Louis is the bomb  I freaking love  Louis  a lot of people  love Louis 
[02:30:00]  excellent terminology  for a white woman  go ahead miss  the bomb  I was just  going to add  to the whole  roadside thing  we just had  a girl killed  here in Pennsylvania  and it's now  getting to the  point where  they're so  ghoulish  that not only  is there like  a whole shroud  of stuff  but there are  people visiting  the side of  this highway  right  just on the  side of the  freaking highway  well that's  because it's  fresh dead  what was she  hit by a saucer  wait a year  wait a year  or two  and the whole  display will be  very faded  from the sun 
[02:30:30]  and there'll be  no visitors  no one will  visit anymore  oh we'll give a  hoot  yeah because  that's exactly  it starts to  get all dingy  and sooty  because in the  end a hundred  years from now  no one's going  to give a crap  that you were  ever here  oh  that's why  gotta die  in the apocalypse  they asked me  if I want  I think we're  gonna scatter  the dog's ashes  because if we  get an urn  that urn's  gonna become  this fucking  clutter in my  house with my  underwear on it  right sure  you know  I don't know  you know  well  get on with life  aunt's ex 
[02:31:00]  mother-in-law  had the urn  of her lovely  Chester  Chester  Lil Chester  that just  kind of  was on display  for everybody  I wonder  if she ever  got buried  with Chester's  ashes  I don't know  if she wanted  to  I don't know  I know people  have their  dogs stuffed  yeah  freeze dried  yeah  I got  I got  are you  loud on the  air  what  I can sit  there  you can  just sit  my  my radio  mentors here  brother  wheeze  and he's  not allowed 
[02:31:30]  to be heard  on the radio  for another  what  six months  but he  was telling  me  what he  wants  done  to his  body  and you're  dead  serious  I know  just get  over there  I don't want  to blow  up your  spot  but I do  want to  tell everyone  we're  we're at  look  and all  your  he's here  with corporate  people  they don't  want you  blowing up  your spot  they're all  doing the  finger across  the neck  thing  you can  at least  nod  you can  at least  nod 
[02:32:00]  right  all right  wheeze  put lights  on him  like  Captain  Pike  wheeze  is dead  serious  when he  dies  and I  hope it's  a long  time from  now  he wants  his skull  to be  given to  his family  so they  could display  it  your skull  his skull  he's dead  serious  he's telling  me this  in the  diner  and I  have a  pretty  open  mind  and I  like  almost  everything  wheeze  says  but I'm  like  you're  insane  that would  creep  everybody 
[02:32:30]  out  hell yeah  what are  they gonna  deal  with it  what  would  they  look at  it  can you  put it  on the  mantle  give them  some paper  can you  write something  down at  least  yeah they  can't prove  who wrote  it  look at  look at  all right  it's not a  bad idea  all right  Susan  I was gonna  call you  another  you can  talk  do you know  the story  no  well it's  worth saying  because this  is insane  he's dead  serious  by the way  investigating  they're hiding 
[02:33:00]  the microphone  all right  wheeze is now  gonna write  something down  on the paper  this is bullshit  by the way  that this  fucking company  used to work  for won't  allow him  even on  satellite radio  because it's  heard still  you know  in rochester  where wheeze  is from  yeah  uh  loey so  as wheeze  writes that  down  what do you  think of  that  that he  wants to  put it  i think  it's an  awesome idea  just having  your skull  around  i mean  because that  lasts for  you know  generations  right  so you know  and you  can't  the thing  is that  no it's  a great  prank  on your  family 
[02:33:30]  because no  one can  just chuck  it in the  garbage  you can't  throw away  like your  grandfather's  skull  and eventually  it'll be  people who  don't even  remember who  he was  and like  who is  this guy  you're with  this  i would  do that  really  hey wheeze  yes or  no would  you allow  like your  family members  to boil  the skin  away at  least  how about  putting a  candle on  it for  halloween  he doesn't  care  chattering  teeth  inside  it'd be  great 
[02:34:00]  if you  have it  hollowed  out  and they  put like  their  forks  and spoons  in it  whatever  they eat  they have  to think  of it  some  nephew  makes a  bong  out of  it  yeah  louie  before we  let you  go  i'm just  trying to  get  some  details  on this  we skull  thing  he's  writing  because  you could  use it  have your  family use  it to  have like  scorpion  bowls  those kind  of tiki  drinks  you know  i would  i would  hope you  break it  out during  the super  bowl  or something  and throw  some chips  in  it was a  special day  for your  skull to be  out  all right  this is what  we just  wrote  he wrote 
[02:34:30]  my daddy's  ashes are  on my  mantle  the skull  was yours  dang  up your  idea  you could  decorate it  for occasions  and holidays  and dress  it up  and pray  to it  what  the hell  man  what do  you want  like your  family to  be hamlet  holding your  skull  talking to you  pray to it  ah poor  wheeze  i knew him  well  he's a  progressive  thinker 
[02:35:00]  but wheeze  that would  creep everybody  out  progressive  thinker  no that's  megalomaniac  i would  like it  to worship  my skull  and i would  like it  to be  backlit  so did  you guys  hear about  ted kennedy's  surgery  yeah we  talked about  this morning  he was awake  for the whole  thing  and how  can you  imagine  like he's  he's  shaving head  brain exposed  and he has  to like  and he's  talking like  an idiot  because they  touch his  brain  and they  say dog  and he  goes  that must  have been  the most 
[02:35:30]  funniest thing  that's ever  happened  we were  saying this  morning  there's  a bunch  of parts  of his  brain  and he's  admitting  to all  sorts  of stuff  stuff we  don't even  know about  yet  exactly  but can you  imagine  we we  described  that just  imagine being  awake as  they make  an incision  around your  hairline  pull back  your scalp  then they  put a  three inch  hole in  which is  like kind  of like  a beer  cup  that that  that size  hole  and then  they have  to uh  what  they use  a scalpel  to remove  the skin  so now  they're  they can  get to  the brain  and you're  awake the  entire time  yeah 
[02:36:00]  and then  but the  thing is  the reason  they do  it is  because they  so they  don't cut  out the  speech center  right  they like  they touch  it and have  you try to  talk and  if you talk  like a  blithering  idiot  then that  they don't  have to  cut that  don't they  know where  that is  isn't there  a map  no well  they can't  quite tell  it all looks  kind of  the samey  yeah  and uh  and it  but it's  ted kennedy  ted kennedy  this weird  character  already  and imagine  if you're  like a  nurse  you just  can't  stop  laughing  right  that he's  you know  yay  yay 
[02:36:30]  they should  shave his  ball bag  just for  the hell  of it  well you're  going for  brain surgery  we're going  to shave  your ball  bag  we gotta  shave  the brain  why  so louie  where's the  dead dog  now  the dead  dog is  ashes  we uh  i put her  in the oven  and i held  her while  down while  they pulled  the board  away  and then  they cooked  her to  1800  degrees  i couldn't  watch that  yeah  the lady  was so  nice and  respectful  and saying 
[02:37:00]  like this  is just  we  she just  gets  cremated  it's just  she turns  into just  dust  and a few  ashes  but then at  the end  she goes  it's like  it gets  really hot  it's like  a grease  fire in  there  right  i'm like  oh thanks  a lot  you're melting  my dog  and did  you really  watch  i didn't  you know  once the  doors close  you don't  see anything  sure  you kind  of have  this feeling  you don't  want her  be alone  till the  end  but at  the same  time  when you  when you  look at  the body  it was  it didn't  look like  her to  me  it just  looked like  like an  amazing 
[02:37:30]  puppet  from like  you know  like a  really good  puppet  from a  George  Lucas  movie  and the  ashes  you're not  bringing them  home  you decided  we're gonna  spread them  somewhere  i think  for the  kids  yeah  it's better  just  have a  ceremony  for the  kids  where we  put the  ashes  somewhere  that  she  ask the  kids  where they  want  to spread  the  ashes  and write  down  their  answers  that'll  make  for good  radio  chucky  cheese  because  they're  you know  they're 
[02:38:00]  limited in  what they  they know  they'll  probably say  the yard  or something  like that  they'll probably  say yeah  they'll probably  say the yard  where she used  to run  around  and stuff  yeah  because then  she's kind  of there  anyway  you feel  like  right  yep  ladies and  gentlemen  club soda  kenny is  hosting the  worst of  opium anthony  you're listening  to the  worst of  opium anthony  so listen  ladies and  gentlemen  ladies and  gentlemen  shut up  and listen  it's the  worst of  opium anthony  hosted by  club soda  kenny 
[02:38:30]  hey it's  jim norton  it's comic  week on  the opium anthony  show  louis ck  was supposed  to be hosting  today's show  but unfortunately  he died of  aids but  since lou  decided to  just not  take care of  himself and  drop dead  club soda  kenny  will sit  in his  place  rest in  peace  lou  i don't  care if  monday's  blue  tuesday's  gray and  wednesday  too  thursday  i don't 
[02:39:00]  care about  you  it's  friday  i'm in  love  now listen  your attention  please  the virus  sirius 197  xm202  it's the  worst of  opium anthony  hosted by  club soda  kenny  let's  begin  we're back  with the  worst of  opium anthony  um  you know  who  louis ck  playing story  louis  tells 
[02:39:30]  airplane  story  and how  they flew  through a  storm  in a  shitty  plane  they all  tell more  plane stories  they take  some callers  here's a  fun fact  i fly  a lot  the worst  of opium anthony  hosted by  club soda  kenny  when we were  doing the  walkover which  we probably  should have  broadcasted  today  louis ck  was telling  us a  horrific  flying story  we told our  little story  which now  sounds like a  cute little  airy plane 
[02:40:00]  ride  when we had  to fly in  during the  storms  into a  newark  airport  after our  vegas show  and it was  it was quite  the bimpy  ride on the  way in  we hit that  wall of clouds  and then it  was nothing  but pure  white out  clouds until  we broke  through  the ceiling  was probably  at 800 feet  well louis flew  an airline i  would not fly  really  no  united  i don't  fuck with  united  why  exactly for  the reason  because  they're 
[02:40:30]  fucking  cunts  that sounds  like a  take the  bull by  the horns  pilot though  that's the  kind of guy  i like  because i  was sitting  there in  the airport  saying uh  uh what  happened to  us was we  we got on  the plane  they loaded  up first  class so  we were  sitting there  drinking a  drink  sipping  sipping  and they  start boarding  you know  last class  as kenny  likes to  call it  and uh  all of a sudden  they get an  announcement uh  could you get  up and leave  the plane  uh there's  now a delay  see i thought  they were just  talking to coach  people exactly  they smell the 
[02:41:00]  joint up  right because  you get out  because we don't  want you in  here while we're  waiting but uh  they told everybody  to get off the  plane because it's  funny to us  we want to watch  you get off and  back on so they  made us all get  off the plane  because of the  delay because of  the weather  right then uh  they tell us it's  going to be you  know like an hour  or two meanwhile  10 minutes later or  so they go all  right back on we  got a window  yeah get out get  in get in  everyone back on so  we all run back on  the plane yeah and  during that time though  i said you know i  want a guy i want a 
[02:41:30]  pilot a man yeah that  go that that has been  in wars that just  goes you know  something fuck this i've  flown in this shit  before we're going for  it right well that's  what i have and just  that you have that  yeah no sometimes you  get a pilot who says  stuff like i had a  pilot once who said  uh you know we're  not they're not  letting us take off  la's locking down  because of the weather  there but i anticipate  that it'll clear up  by the time we get  there so i'm actually  telling them we're  going to las vegas i've  had a pilot say this  and then we'll reroute  like well you're lying  to the fucking tower  don't lie to them 
[02:42:00]  uh control we're going  to um las vegas  colorado  to nevada  nevada  las vegas nevada  yeah  well we might  we might take a turn  somewhere before that  i think so  we're probably  we're going to  las  that was funny  i look like  las  las  guardia  but so this guy 
[02:42:30]  we're sitting at the  gate waiting and then  he said there's actually  the delay isn't because  of the weather it's  because the fuel gauge  is broken on the  plane of course there's  a hunk of shit  you know so but we  we had somebody  they still have the  ashtrays in the  bathrooms  that equipment is old  that's why i can't  fly united i had to  once and i saw like  ashtrays they still  didn't take out of  the bathroom which  means wow this plane  is pretty old and  then they had like a  razor dispenser or  something yeah you  could actually get a  razor plate you can  shave  right here in the 
[02:43:00]  plane you can shave  if you want the  miracle of modern  flight  light up a lucky  strike and join us  on a trans  continental flight  with no stops  it's the miracle  so as i saw the  old ashtrays and it  might not have been  united but it was  some airline it was  a white knuckler all  the way yes and the  seats have that kind  of 60s mike brady  kind of pattern on  them oh great if the  seats are old how old  is the engine really  exactly you're gonna  tell me they they  replaced them great 
[02:43:30]  that's still not gonna  give me comfort but  contact  contact  and the engines are  made from space age  polymers  yes so the guy says  the fuel gauge is  broken but we filled  up the tanks we  topped them off and  we had someone climb  up and look in the  tank that's what you  do when you have a  motorcycle and you  don't want to know  yeah exactly you don't  want to know that  there's a dude you  want to think that  something really weird  and scientific is  right it's like a  dude looked some guy 
[02:44:00]  looked I hope that  dude is not a fucking  idiot like now I have  to hope we hope he  has depth perception  yeah and hoping he's  not just hung over  like yeah oh yeah I  checked exactly did  you check the wing  fucking shut up you  fuck all those people  on the plane tell me  there's a little like  minor thing like that's  broken I'm like what  else is broken on the  plane yeah exactly and  usually when your car  breaks down it's not  one thing all of a  sudden everything is  breaking at the same  but here's the thing  this was like a little  time release capsule of  terror that he left  with us because he said 
[02:44:30]  he said this is no  problem because we know  we have more than enough  fuel to get there  sure because it's full  that would be more  than we need and we  can even circle for a  little while with that  amount of fuel so then  we get to LaGuardia and  we're circling and  circling and circling and  then he says we've only  got 20 minutes worth of  fuel left how the fuck  does he know that when  the fuel gauge is broken  yeah yes he did a math  problem in his head  probably he did it through  time but look he's  saying he knows how  many hours you can fly  on certain amount of  fuel yeah but if maybe  there's more stress on 
[02:45:00]  the engine when it's  getting when it's going  through bad weather  wind if he's five  minutes off we're  going to drop from  the sky like a set of  fucking car keys  avianca did that yeah  right into long island  yeah so so he goes we  got 20 minutes of fuel  left so and LaGuardia is  you know trying to shut  down but it's minute to  minute so we're going to  go ahead and make an  approach to LaGuardia  airport and as we get  closer if it gets bad  we'll divert and use the  last of our fuel to land  in Allentown Pennsylvania  we have enough fuel to do 
[02:45:30]  exactly that oh my so so  then he starts coming in  we'll divert to a place  where there's lots of  big open fields where  innocent people won't be  killed we will divert to  the fucking to the to you  know to the Verrazano  Narrows ladies and  gentlemen one thing you  won't have to worry about  is fire there is no fuel  left in the tank yes we  are doing 500 miles an  hour yes you won't burn  thank you but so he he  starts coming and we  start dropping down into  the clouds and it's the 
[02:46:00]  ugliest fucking I mean  the clouds are yellow and  brown out the window  it was nasty and there's  water on scene right  yeah and so me and the  guy next to me the  fucking two idiots we  put on the headphones and  listen to the channel that  you can listen to the  tower you can listen to  your plane talking to the  tower and so he says  to United 266 we're  making an approach we're  making an approach and  then we hear LaGuardia  tower say do not land 266  the winds are far too  heavy it's not it's not  safe lane we're shutting  down don't go divert 
[02:46:30]  right now how do you  not pull the headphones  off and just make  believe you didn't hear  it like and the guy  says we can't divert  now we're only if we  have only four minutes  tops of fuel left  holy so we have to come  in oh and the tower is  saying it's not a good  idea but go ahead because  what else are you gonna  do give it a shot  give it a shot Jim  all right hot shot  and right at that moment  the stewardess comes up to  you would you like to have  some coffee yeah no the  flight attendants are all  strapped in and invisible 
[02:47:00]  they're nowhere to be  seen yeah and I'm holding  out like it's gonna help  I'm holding on to my  fucking window like the  edges of the window just  like just in my fit I'm  stamping my foot just  uncontrollably wow you are  fucking scared well because  we're drop we keep  dropping in the and the  once the the uh the uh the  landing gear goes down and  there's all that drag on the  plane yeah the thing is  pitching and rolling and  making impossible banks to  the left and right I mean  it's like a fucking man  like a joke and we're  going and the woman  there's one behind us  holding two children 
[02:47:30]  screaming and sobbing  literally literally going  oh my god oh my god she's  doing exactly that that's  the soundtrack for everyone  on the plane oh my god  that's horrible and she's  got tears bursting like  she's on a fucking train to  fucking Auschwitz  no I gotta die she's saying  her kids she's saying we're  gonna die to her kids she's  telling her kids are gonna  die oh that's fan fucking  tastic yeah and for the  flight the pilot sounding  stressed on the even more 
[02:48:00]  than I've heard black box  recorders and the pilot is  like sounds like he's  smoking a cigarette till the  second before death he's  like we only have four  minutes of fuel we can't  divert like he sounded like  that you probably thought  you were watching a movie  oh no it was like wow this  is great why wouldn't this  be death if I wasn't on this  plane this would be great to  listen to this is well  directed yeah I love this  movie I love the woman in  the back seat she was  awesome and we drop out of  the clouds and we see where 
[02:48:30]  we are we are so close to  those fucking Queens  housing projects uh-huh  in the x-shape yep like  it's like the nightmares you  have if we were to if the if  the wing were to tip over  we'd hit you're hitting it  and we're going I've gone  over those housing projects  thousands of times I fly all  the time we're going so  fucking fast we're flying  like we're just shooting  over Queens man and every  even the most Texan tough  guy passengers that were  on the from Denver that  were on that plane are  like whoa hey  and we just it was so bad 
[02:49:00]  that when I just to jump  ahead for a second when I  got in the cab uh uh the  guy said the cabbie said I  saw that plane coming that  looked bad like cabbies on  the ground watching because  we're the only assholes that  fucking land no one else was  coming in and so we're  coming in and the plane is  looks I mean I I'm  convinced we're hitting the  BQE we're gonna just  whatever it is and we hit  the ground so fucking hard  and my heart is racing and I  had tears in my eyes just 
[02:49:30]  like just involuntary wow  tears coming down my face  like what are these and the  pilot says ladies and  gentlemen you are free to  turn on your cell phones and  call your loved ones and  every single person with a  phone was the whole plane  was chatter of like you  wouldn't believe what just  happened to me honey I  thought I was gonna die and  I looked at my phone and I  thought about calling my  wife and I'm like fuck her  I didn't call her fuck her  I thought I was just about  to die but fuck her you  call like a friend I don't 
[02:50:00]  want to hear dude you never  guess what the fuck was  tackling because I know it  would have been like honey I  thought I was gonna die oh  that's awful did you uh are  you what time are you getting  in uh why are you so why  was tomorrow morning are you  gonna let me sleep in well  honey I just thought I  don't understand fuck you  what the fuck why didn't  that story get out that's  obvious he was fired he  should be fucking fired it  was really bad I think what  happened was that he had  enough time to do what he  thought he but then the  tower sent him through an  approach that took longer  than it took longer it's 
[02:50:30]  just what happened with  avianca they they were  flying around and that was  a language barrier too they  were they didn't declare an  emergency uh they declared  something that was just under  an emergency yeah so they  kept diverting him from  airport to airport and  making him circle and the  plane ran out of fucking  gas yep and the the people  that survived the crash  were like all of a sudden  you hear this silence and  all you hear is the wind  wishing over the wings oh  whoosh whoosh no more  and you know how how the  noise of the engines kind of 
[02:51:00]  cancels out noise in the  cabin yeah no you hear  everything you hear the  people in the back fucking  row if you're in first  class and just and they  crashed into the woods yep  no fire no explosion just  cracking trees and fucking  you know a lot of people  live because of that right  on kind of near where i live  no no when when you run out  of fuel in a plane it's not  like when you run out of gas  on a car when you run out of  gas on a car you can actually  like use the starter motor to  get it a little yeah yeah  right kind of keep sputtering 
[02:51:30]  but on a plane it's just it's  and you can stop and get the  fuck out yes no matter where  you are in a car how did the  dudes because he told us that  he couldn't be sure how much  fuel there was on the plane  before we left right he said  we know the gauges are wrong  but we're gonna go anyway  because we've seen the gas so  then you bet it well then you  know something when you get  that close you go let's fucking  land now you might even be  able to justify that if you're  going from point a to point b  without any problems that's  if you're going into weather  where you're gonna have to  circle and when you're talking 
[02:52:00]  about we have four minutes  four minutes left how fast is  that four minutes off you're  dead and he has no gauge that  four minutes is not four  minutes in a dentist chair  yeah that four minutes is  four minutes on a roller  coaster all of our pilots now  fucking all of our pilots are  vietnam combat tested by  pilots but they're also  fucked up vietnam vets that  kind of don't give a shit  they just think you're a  bunch of faggots whining on  the back of the plane all you  people that call me a baby 
[02:52:30]  killer uh we're going in yeah  it was uh 1990  i'll be on all right well  why don't we take a break and  continue that's uh that's that's  that's a great that is a  harrowing experience worst flight  ever for you i guess right  easily i mean i'm a fucking  platinum and 15 different  airlines i found a million  miles probably i fly through  bad weather all the i i sleep  through it i don't give a shit  i actually have often turned to  people around me on planes that  look scared and said i've seen  this this is nothing don't worry 
[02:53:00]  but i don't care i like flying  the lady behind me by the way i  was i even i kept yelling  back we're okay like i kept  yelling at her and i was  yelling at myself we're gonna  be okay we're gonna be okay  we're gonna be okay  fucking torture oh man there  was something about the worst  thing i ever went there was  something about flying on  sunday because you could feel  it in the air when we were in  uh vegas we're getting ready to  go we're like wow i think this  one's gonna be a bad one  it was tense because we also  have flown in a lot of bad  weather but nothing like uh  this past sunday it got so  fucking quiet in the cabin when  we were bouncing around in the 
[02:53:30]  clouds and uh patrice turns  around and goes i just want to  and to all of us he goes to  kind of loud he goes i just  want to tell you i i love you  all and then turns back around  and the second we landed he  went look i it got a little  crazy back there i got a little  scared yeah you know don't mean  nothing by it yeah and then  they canceled 500 flights after we  landed so yeah they were pretty  much close to the airport after we  the jostling around and shaking  and and the plane kind of doing  those whoop and i was looking 
[02:54:00]  out the window at the wing and  you can anticipate what's going  to happen in the fuselage by  watching the wing tip so you can  anticipate the bumps yes so you  watch the wing tip and man it's  just it's moving like the wings are  flapping i'm on a fucking on a  goose like an 1800s guys idea of a  flying machine where the fucking  yeah where the wings flap and he  jumps off a rock and it crashes like  that guy's plane it's gonna drop a  baby into a chimney somewhere but  you you taught us that those ways 
[02:54:30]  could like touch i've seen wind  tunnels and turbulence tests where  the wingtips just about touch on  top but they can bend but you don't  ever want to see them moving like  that anthony and i had eye contact  because we were both doing the same  thing looking out the window like  hello where's the ground yeah we've  been approaching for like 40 minutes  and it's looking at me and then we're  both look out the window like and  then finally when you saw the  ground finally we were so it was  amazing how close we were a piece of  ground come out and we were low and i  looked at open on did you see the  guy goes yeah i just saw the ground 
[02:55:00]  and then i'm going i see more ground  he goes yeah it's good i go we better  start seeing runway though because it's  getting really low no but when you hit  the ground in flights like that the  instant the wheels touch the ground  you're like i don't care what else  happens to me yeah we like skid off of  the fucking runway i don't care if  what's that country if iran invades  tomorrow yeah and start sodomizing  me daily i made it i'm on the ground  when the wheels hit it's like that for  two maybe three seconds you stop  breathing yes and wait for that quick 
[02:55:30]  slowdown then like deceleration and then  you feel it instantly like okay we're  good yeah get on the phone and then you  just start worrying about whatever  bullshit you just get broadsided by a  747 coming in at 500 miles an hour  hey we met what happened we're gonna  break and uh and i guess we don't need  uh bad flight stories today louis ck we  just heard the topper louis ck what  happened jimmy one more what what  happened jim i was uh i was flying to 
[02:56:00]  la actually and uh it was after breakfast  and uh my cinnamon roll didn't have as  much frosting that's the cinnamon roll on  the person next to me who was fuckers  you must have been panicking yeah i had  to ring the bell twice to get my tomato  juice  tom in tennessee what's up  hey morning boys what's going on hey um  i worked on jets for nine and a half 
[02:56:30]  years and the pilot told louis a flat out  lie you cannot look at the gas in the  plane everything is sealed they would  had to bring out major tools to open  the tanks up the whole jet is a big ass  fuel tank in the wings the belly right  no you know what that makes sense  because it's not like when you fill up  a jet you just fucking it's not like a  motorcycle you just yeah the nozzle  between your legs i just said when you  gotta tip it around to make it hear the  sloshing when you told me that all i  thought of was a scene in um god the 
[02:57:00]  great escape when steve mcqueen takes  the gas cap off and shakes the bike a  little bit and then takes off again  all they did was rely on the fuel truck  asking him how much he had in the truck  and how much he had left oh god so  somebody's doing like a seventh grade  math and let me tell you they never top  the tanks off no they don't because they  only it would be um it's not fuel  efficient right they put in enough gas  they as they need to get from point a to  point b and then some extra for circling 
[02:57:30]  but you give you fill your tank up you're  just hauling more weight yep so they had  just enough thanks pal that's that makes  four minutes is frightening this is this is  really funny steve on long island go ahead  i just wanted to relate a quick story  while i was back in uh going back to  college upstate um we took a cessna up  there we got some ice on our wings  uh-oh and i looked down bro and we  weren't moving and all of a sudden my  i look at the pilot and i go we gonna go 
[02:58:00]  down and he didn't answer my buddy in  the back goes we're all gonna die it was  the sickest shit what happened my life and  we were going backwards because of all  the ice on the wings man going backwards  it might have looked that way sir it's  crazy like a piece of paper all right  and then a giant dragon came along yeah  that's right blocked us out of the sky

[03:00:00]  thought he was a genius and now i have  to think you're the genius well what bit  was it off his first album i don't  know i never heard his album  please of course you have couldn't be  bothered  like you would take me to task  yeah you like it i was gonna say of  course you have that's where you got  your act weird i've never said anything  about it and i don't know why that just  made me because you know why because he  was shitty to you that makes me he did  but he fucking totally was i don't care 
[03:00:30]  that he skates and has whatever buddy  the fact that he was a douche to you  just we've settled we've since settled  it first time i've said anything about  he's a friend of the shows up in boston  uh i was there with my friend adam  ferrara who was in uh the job to show  the job with him and uh uh adam's like  yeah i'll take you up and meet uh  dennis uh so i go upstairs we're  hanging out all hanging out all my  friends everybody's hanging around the  bar's kind of full dennis is up there  getting a drink i decide not to wait  for adam i can do this myself i'll walk  up to dennis leary say hey dennis i'm a 
[03:01:00]  friend of adam ferrara shake his hand  and start talking and that'll be that so  i walk up to the bar i go hi dennis i'm  a friend of adam ferrara name's anthony he  goes doesn't even look at me he goes  how you doing and then turns his back  to me he wasn't talking to anybody yeah  he wasn't busy he just went how you  doing turned his back to me and i was  just like and so i walk away slowly and  it was so bad that all my friends and  oh everybody workers everybody we were  uncomfortable couldn't even laugh at me 
[03:01:30]  for it they oh no i looked i got a quick  enough look to see them turn away and not  look at me that's bad oh oh dude and  forgot the part where dennis leary  actually kind of did the backwards  handshake but i'm like yeah he just goes  yeah how you doing and reaches out his  hand like yeah yeah i was like oh and  all i was thinking is i should have  waited for adam you but you felt stupid  dude hey so stupid i felt like such a  douche and everyone was embarrassed for  me which hurt even more i'm so happy 
[03:02:00]  that i knew you'd love it yeah i i we  can't let louie off the hook here let me  tell you let me tell you what happened i'll  tell you i have to tell you everything  for it to to be fair oh because uh well  when i was a young fella starting in  boston i guess i was like 19 or 20 19 and  i was doing my signature bit the bit i  closed with was a bit about uh if you  were an asshole and you knew it and how  cool it would be to just say i'm an  asshole and just let yourself have that  life that your life would be better  like you're driving you go hey should i 
[03:02:30]  cut that guy off yeah i'm an asshole  why not you know uh parking a handicapped  space only an asshole would do that  oh fuck it i'll do it i'm an asshole  that's me and they said they should have  like a picture of an asshole instead of  a wheelchair and just make those the  asshole spaces and the whole bit anyway  so one night i'm doing a show at a  place called played against sam's in  boston and dennis is the host of the  show he was a huge star in boston at  the time and uh on the comedy circuit  and he went on after me he was always  nice to me by the way put me on the 
[03:03:00]  shows when i wasn't on them should be  gave me guest spots and then that night  he went on after me uh after i'd done  the asshole bit and like went that's  really funny and like remarked on it and  expounded on it like yeah like and that  like i'll do this because i'm an  asshole and i'll do that because i'm an  asshole like he just started he actually  started riffing on my bit but  acknowledging that he just watched me  do it yeah which is i think is okay and  then like um i don't know a month later  something i'm downstairs at sam's i just 
[03:03:30]  come walk in and he's doing he's just  doing the bit just started he just  started doing it and i was young and just  started out and i was like well he's  huge wow i'm flattered what do i do  well and i remember thinking angry i  remember thinking to myself well  that's weird that he would steal it's  too bad that he has to i'm tired of the  bit myself i feel i felt like i'd outgrown  it and so i just thought i think i just  let it go and i did and uh yeah so then 
[03:04:00]  it became this what i think you're about  to play yes of course  yeah yeah i drive really slow in the  ultra fast lane while people behind me  louis song  yeah dude people in handicapped spaces and  handicapped  yeah get that line too  i use public toilets and i piss on the seat  i walk around in the summertime saying how  about this 
[03:04:30]  you do realize louis yeah the songs made  a huge amount of money yeah he more  than stole a bit from you that's a number  one single. That's his signature fucking  thing. That was a video 
[03:05:00]  on MTV. That's how big that bit  was for him. It wasn't like a  throwaway little bit you did.  This is what he's known for.  Yeah, it was a career-making bit.  He's still a career-maker. He still sings a song  every time he performs.  As a matter of fact, the last time  during two years  ago at the New York Comedy Festival  he was  and I was on the show.  Actually, I think he did it  and then brought me on.  I don't identify with it anymore. 
[03:05:30]  The other thing, the pieces that are important  to tell is that years later  I'm living in New York City. I run into Dennis  on the set of a movie he's doing and he  says, God, you're always so funny.  What are you doing with yourself? At the time I was trying to finance  an independent feature I was  making and he gave me  several thousand dollars  and helped me. He just basically gave me money.  That was guilt money.  Yeah, which I never really even thought of that  but I guess that's true.  I mean, he gave  and so he invested in it  and when I run into Dennis  we say hi to each other  and 
[03:06:00]  Does he count out the money going  and  and then yeah  and then when I did his show  in Avery Fisher Hall  and he played this song  and brought me on  and I remember thinking  that's silly.  That's a silly moment in my life  but I just don't  I don't know.  It's weird.  I don't  I've never  never said anything  and it's just funny  because this  this other poor  fucking idiot  has been accused  for three years now  of stealing shit from me  and I've never said a word about that 
[03:06:30]  because I  I'm ambivalent about it  but this is a guy  who I completely watched  steal my bid  and make money off of it  and I've never done a fucking thing  a career off of it.  You know what the funny thing is  there's another story you told too  where Louis walked in  one of the danger fields  remember that  and fucking Roddy was there  and he goes  how you doing  and you're like  I don't feel like I get no respect  I understand how you feel  I mean I've always had  kind of a perspective  about people that  steal material  that I feel like they're  I don't know 
[03:07:00]  it feels like what they do  to themselves  is probably a lot worse  than anything  I mean what am I going to do  about it  I just kind of  continue to live in my life  you know  making more things  but  but that is  the dentist thing  is a weird one  and I guess  since he gave me money  for my movie  and he was always  generally kind to me  I always felt like  well I'd be a hypocrite  to say something about it  and for some reason  when I heard Anthony  say that he was rude  that he's rude to you  he was rude to me  the first time  it just lit me off  made me mad  but then we've had him  on the show  many many times  and he does your bits 
[03:07:30]  very well  but Louis is a fucking  shocking guy  he employs my buddy  he's been a shocking guy  since he was a little kid  like when you said  you were a little kid  and he told me this  he was a boy  he would always curse  what would he say  I think he went one time  to see George Carlin  and they introduced him  to young Louis  and Louis was trying  to be shocking  and he was like  shit piss fuck  I suck a motherfucker  he goes how many words  was that seven  was that seven curses  you just threw  and Louis lied  and they said  where'd you hear that  he went on television  that's impossible 
[03:08:00]  it's like  I'm like the  Forrest Gump  of comedy  yes  Louis it continues today  Steven S. from Bayshore  writes  this just in  Dennis' ex-wife  let his dog out  he got hit by a car  so he's  oh my god  Jesus Christ  holy shit  Steven S. are you crazy  oh my goodness  he cried over that dog  and I just get  oh let's all suck  Louis' dick  oh really  who said that  let's do it  I still owe him  from Lucky Louis 
[03:08:30]  so let's get going  I'll be happy to suck  yeah  god that sounded  oh that was from  Dennis L. I'm sorry  that's a big story  right there  that's a Google alert  right there  for yourself  I don't like it  I don't like  the comedy blogger  is going to run  with that one  my friend  oh sir  I don't like it  we got Dan and I  how are you  hey Dan  I know but  hey guys  what's going on  it's in the contract  we need one Dan  caller a day  yes Dan  I just read  on the internet  this morning  Dennis Lurie's got  a new TV show 
[03:09:00]  called Lucky Leary  coming out  oh my goodness  oh my goodness  that fellow  that fellow  has got to stop  Lucky Leary  Lucky Leary  I mean enough already  that's funny  and you know  what a whore I am  I'd do it  I'd step over  I'd step over  and lose  cardiac arrest  having body  and go to the set  ladies and gentlemen  whoops over to Kenny  is hosting the worst  of Opie and Anthony  next thing titled  Dennis Leary  responds to  Louis C.K  Dennis is in studio 
[03:09:30]  and responds  to Louis' comments  that's all that was written  so that's all you get  broadcasting the worst  of Opie and Anthony  hosted by Club Soda Kenny  but the book Dennis  come on  the book baby  why we suck  a feel good guide  to staying fat  loud  lazy  and stupid  yes  I'm very proud  of this book  are you over  the autism  controversy  well I have a couple  things I'd like  to say about that  really  yeah  Louis C.K  wrote that chapter  Louis is like 
[03:10:00]  thank you  thank you  thank you  yeah  if there's anything  else in the book  you don't like  Bill Hicks wrote that  I want to talk  about Louis C.K  for a second  okay  then we'll get  into autism  apparently somebody  has contacted  Louis  oh he's told  the story  on our show  I know  I heard about it  I didn't hear it  somebody contacted  Eddie Brill  from the Letterman Show  he's an old friend  of mine  contacted Louis  and said  hey  Chris Phillips  wrote the  A-hole song  with Dennis  and actually  it was Chris's idea  he's the one  that came up  with the riff  and it tumbled 
[03:10:30]  out of our heads  and when he  told Louis  Louis said  oh my god  I should call  Chris Phillips  and apologize  no call to me  though  apparently the lines  that Chris wrote  in the A-hole song  are fine  but I stole all  the lines I wrote  from Louis C.K  wow  so and Louis  by the way  the money I gave you  to make that movie  was not guilt money  I had no idea  you thought I stole  your material  I actually believed  in you as a filmmaker  period  that's the end  of that story  what movie  did you give  him money  to  I don't even 
[03:11:00]  want to get into it  I gave him money  to make a movie  because I believe  him as a filmmaker  apparently he said  on your show  that he thought  it was blood guilt money  you know what's funny  we do our show  every day  and I swear to God  I vaguely remember  Louis saying that  there was a problem  with the A-hole song  with Dennis Leary  and now I gotta go  listen to what Louis  said to bring it  all together  no you don't have  to listen to it  whatever  I just wanted  to say it publicly  but I don't care 
[03:11:30]  what they say  I'm in love  with you  they try to  pull me away  but they don't  know the truth  my heart's  crippled by the  vein  that I keep  on closing  you cut me  open  and I  keep  bleeding  I keep  keep  bleeding  love  I keep  bleeding  I keep  keep  bleeding  love  keep  bleeding  I keep  keep

[03:12:30]  boating  Louis talks  about his  boating trip  with his dad  going down  the Hudson River  continue talking  about boat  stories  I bought  this shitty  powerboat  in upstate  New York  a couple  summers ago  and it was a  huge waste  of money  but I bought  it from  this guy  and it had  like the  back of it  was cracking  I mean it was  just the dumbest  thing but I  bought it  because we 
[03:13:00]  where I was  upstate  then we were  on the Hudson  River  so I had  this weird  idea to take  the boat  to New York  City  from Hudson  New York  it's connected  120 miles up  and I called  my dad  who we don't  really speak  much to my dad  and I called  him out of  nowhere and said  you want to  take this trip  with me  so he drove  and I'm with  my dad  who I don't  really communicate  with  and we took  this trip  down the  Hudson River  on this boat  and when we  got into the  mouth of the  fucking Hudson  here  New York  Harbor  the Hudson  River 
[03:13:30]  isn't really  that bad  but there  are parts  around Manhattan  that are  fucking  treacherous  I had no  knowledge  of boating  or anything  you don't need  anything to buy  a boat  you just buy it  you don't really  need a license  you have to  register  you only have  to go to the  DMV to register  the trailer  that it sits on  and when you  do that  if they have  one  they throw you  a boating  manual  and say  if you could  take a look  at this  so I just  went out  on the river  just with  no fucking  idea  I don't even  know how  much my 
[03:14:00]  gas tanks  hold  you don't  even know  where the  next gas  station  or the  fill up  will be  because I'm  fine with  if I run  out of gas  on the boat  and then  someone takes  it and they  keep the boat  I don't care  so I stop  at a gas  station  a boat  I find  this river  community  there is  it's really  fascinating  I stop  at a gas  station  he fills  me up  and I  tell him  I'm going  to New York  City  tell me  everything  I need  to know  so he  goes  well first  of all  you're  missing  about  50  things  that are 
[03:14:30]  essential  you have  to have  you're in  illegal  territory  and it  gives me  life vests  but because  I'm buying  shit from  him  he's happy  to give  me information  and he  explains to  me that  the Hudson  River is  not a river  it's not a  river at all  it's not a  river with a  source that's  flowing to the  ocean  it's called an  estuary  it's affected  by tides  yes  and it's  basically  the Atlantic  Ocean  sloshes  in and out  of the  river  and he  says  if you  hit  Manhattan  at a  bad  time  you're  going  to be  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  basically 
[03:15:00]  what do you  mean  it's  great  it's  all  it's  sloshing  in and out  and it's  all  it's  it's  it's  flowing  out  but it's  tidal  it's  a tidal  estuary  and so  there was  because  when I  was  it was  like  glass  it was  beautiful  where I  was  and he  goes  it's  not  going  to  stay  like  that  try  not  to  get  there  around  rush  hour  because  also  there's  ferries  down  there  that don't  care  who you  are  what you  do  so  I  don't  listen  to  people  so  I  showed  up  at  like 
[03:15:30]  5.30  p.m.  on the  Hudson  River  and I'm  going under  the  George  Washington  Bridge  I mean  it's  the craziest  thing  I've  ever  done  and  with  my  dad  who's  70  something  I don't  even  know  how old  he is  and my  dad  is  trying  not to  show how  much  this is  hurting  his  body  because  I'm  his son  and he  does  he's  ashamed  that I'm  actually  like  I'm  fucking  shattering  his  skeleton  his  fucking  teeth  are falling  out  and shit  it's  just  like  are you  hearing  that  sound  on  the  hall  that  we're  hitting 
[03:16:00]  so hard  I don't  know how  to do  I don't  know how  to ride  a boat  so I  don't  know  if  you're  supposed  to  have  it  trimmed  out  right  or  anything  like  you  could  trim  a  boat  out  for  water  where  you're  putting  the  front  end  down  I know  a little  bit  about that  but I  don't  have  a  trim  tabs  I  had  a  trimmy  thing  on  the  throttle  I'm  trying  to make  that  hard  ride  man  so  hard  and  the  back  just  slamming  into  waves  so  hard  you think  the hull's  going to  crack  it's  crazy  and  then  when  we  get  further  and  further  in  there's  a  point  where 
[03:16:30]  I've  got  the  engine  running  at  full  bore  and  I  ain't  moving  I'm  just  going  up  and  down  bang  bang  and  we  also  we  realize  we're  getting  soaked  and  we  realize  that  and  fairies  are  fucking  booking  past  us  just  you  know  crazy  honking  at  us  not  stopping  nothing  and  I  realized  that  because  I  pictured  what's  the  worst  that  happens  the  boat  sinks  under  you  and  you  just  tread  water  and  wave  at  the 
[03:17:00]  helicopter  I  realized  if this  thing  goes  down  the  waves  are  going to  disappear  into  black  water  there's  going to  be  nothing  left  of  us  and  I'm  trying  to  get  and  also  I  was  supposed  to  park  in  New  Jersey  I  like  rented  I  called  ahead  and rented  a space  on a  dock  in New  Jersey  next to  Manhattan  and I  can see  New  Jersey  but I  can't  get  I  can't  move  I  can't  get across  the river  and also  these waves  are throwing  me like  towards  these big  fucking  cement  walls  in  Manhattan 
[03:17:30]  it's like  the worst  thing  ever  and my  arms  are  aching  from  trying to  keep  the boat  in one direction  did you wave  to New  Jersey  as you  were  heading  toward  the  ocean  it  took  us  it  took  us  about  four  hours  to get  the  120  miles  from  Hudson  New  York  to  George  Washington  Bridge  to  that  big  Colgate  sign  in  New  Jersey  I  think  that  took 
[03:18:00]  us  several  hours  it  was  the  worst  thing  and  then  other  times  of  the  day  the  water  sloshing  out  and  you  know  that  night  the  way  I  got  home  I  did  research  fucking  like  a  person  you  knew  the  tides  at  that  I  sent  my dad  home  on the  train  because  I  had  to  get  the  boat  out  of  there  put  about  50  years  on  him  took  a few  of  the  last  few  years  he  had  left  and  I  got 
[03:18:30]  on  the  boat  at  like  3  o'clock  in  the  morning  I  got  back  that  was  the  greatest  thing  by  the  Statue  of  Liberty  around  the  base  under  Manhattan  went  up  the  east  river  by  the  U.N.  building  and everything  and the  prisons  and  had  the  greatest  radio  in the  middle  of  the  night  radio  blasting  just  standing  on  this  boat  just  fucking  earlier  in the  day  it was  just  bam  oh my 
[03:19:00]  god  was that  the  tides  or  just  all  the  traffic  both  because  the  traffic  does  the  traffic  stirs  up  it's  cauldron  but  it's  the  fucking  sick  when  high  tide  hits  in  the  Atlantic  yeah  it  pushes  the  water  up  the  river  so  the  actual  river  is  flowing  down  from  the  Hudson  but  the  tide  is  stronger  so  it  pushes  it  back  then  when  the  tide  lets  go  all  that  fucking  water  that  it  pushed  up 
[03:19:30]  comes  rushing  back  in  but  when  you're  going  in  when  the  tide  is  coming  south  down  the  Hudson  river  fuck  you  you're  battling  the  ocean  in  a  tiny  channel  we're  the  only  boat  going  south  and  they  were  probably  all  like  who  is  this  fucking  idiot  and  other  boats  were  looking  at us  I 
[03:20:00]  and  you're  going  by  on  a  little  boat  you  feel  sick  to  your  stomach  because  you're  like  this  is  all  just  too  huge  for  me  this  is  like  blade  runner  I  can't  hack  this  it  was  smaller  than  that  shit  that's  upside  down  in  Florida  right now  that's  a  20  footer  that  we're  looking  at  on  TV  it  was  I  don't  know  how  many  feet  it  was  four  seats  front  and back  can I  solve 
[03:20:30]  this  mystery  for  everybody  the  NFL  player  thing  it's  so  obvious  what  happened  because  the  guy  they  rescued  was  sitting  on top  of the  thing  holding  on to  the  anchor  when  this  fucking  thing  flipped  over  it  was  every  man  for  themselves  and  it's  like  fuck  you  I  know  we're  all  friends  but  now  it's  like  whoever  the  strongest  guy  is  is  going  to  survive  because  there  was  only  one  slot  to  hang  on  and  it  was  the  position  that  guy  took  he  was  Kate  Winslet  while  Leo  frozen  the  water  slipped  under  the  I  would  bet  money  there  was  some  kind  of  struggle 
[03:21:00]  and  this  guy  won  over  the  other  three  because  they  all  went  into  panic  mode  because  if  you  look at  the  boat  there's  nowhere  else  to  hold  on  to  that's  possible  you  would  think  you  know  maybe  lifejackets  yeah  why  it  feels  like  they  got  in  a  fight  about  something  else  yeah  maybe  like  maybe  why  are  you  in  the  NFL  and  I  suck  that's  horrible  people  are  dead  but  that's  the  only  reason  one  guy  survived  it's  not me  it's  not  my  kids  that's  the  only  reason  one  guy  survived  there was  only  one  spot  one  spot  available  and  there 
[03:21:30]  was  four  of  them  that  so  they  went  into  panic  maybe  they  chose  him  maybe  they  chose  him  no  the  other  guys  just  they're  fish  with  the  anchor  there  was  there's  no  way  for  four  people  look at  the  boat  and how  it's  tipped  over  there's  nowhere  to hold  on to  what  was  the  anchor  that  hole  that  thing  was  a  hole  they  said  they  were  anchored  I  don't  think  here's  what  I  think  happened  because  and  I'm  taking  it  from  my  own  stupid  experience  the  thing  you  don't  realize  until  you're  out  there  like  in  any  kind  of  bad  waters  you  picture  shit  from  a  movie  you  picture  shit  going  down  and  you  step  off 
[03:22:00]  the  boat  while  it's  sinking  and  you  and  your  friends  tread  water  and  talk  about  it  for  a  while  and  one  by  one  you  try  to  help  each  other  and  there's  this  whole  thing  where  the  humans  survive  but  when  a  boat  goes  down  it  takes  fucking  a  nanosecond  for your  dumb  little  lungs  to fill  with  water  and  you're  just  dead  sink  sink  sink  you're  gone  you're  being  picked  at  by  little  fish  as  you're  going  down  to  the  bottom  that's  it  that 
[03:22:30]  lifeless  fucking  dull  eyeball  is  just  being  plucked  away  it's  just  weird  that  one  survivor  had  a  nice  seat  on  top  of  the  boat  when  a  boat  capsizes  in  bad  water  everybody  dies  it's  not  a  slow  hey  I  think  we're  rolling  over  this  boat's  rolling  oh  that's  not  oxygen  whoops  dead  I'm  dead  now  but  your  boat  story  rules  I 
[03:23:00]  we  found  this  town  called  Hudson  in  New  York  it  looks  like  Nantucket  it's  a  very  colonial  looking  it looks  like  a  New  England  town  and  I  read  about  it  and  I  found  out  that  what  Hudson  New  York  is  it's  120  miles  up  the  river  and  what  it  is  is  they  were  people  from  Nantucket  who  were  whalers  and 
[03:23:30]  back  in  the  1800s  the  British  kept  just  burning  their  ships  and  burning  their  town  the  British  would  just  sit  outside  of  Nantucket  and  just  lob  there  was  no  war  going  on  they  were  just  being  assholes  during  the  1800s  the  war  of  1812  was  just  being  dicks  and  us  going  you  really  got  to  cut  the  shit  and  them  going  fuck  off  and  just  launch  cannonballs  and set  Nantucket  on fire  for  fun  so  a  bunch  of  people  near  Nantucket 
[03:24:00]  said  let's  just  get  out  of  here  and  they  all  left  together  all  these  whalers  and  they  found  Hudson  New York  which was  a nice  place  to build  a town  up the  Hudson  River  and so  what they  would do  is  they  take  their  whaling  ships  this  is  the  fucking  1800s  people  like  with  wood  and  iron  yeah  they  took  their  ships  and  they  go  out  into  the  North  Atlantic  and  they  kill  a  whale  and  they  drag  it  with  these  boats  up  the  Hudson  River  all  those  fucking  miles  and  they  cut  it  up  and  then  send  it  down  the  river  in  pieces  you  know  that  isn't  right  man  oh  the  whale  thing 
[03:24:30]  yeah  man  like  back  then  there  were  fucking  whales  you  walk  across  the  whales  to  get  fuck  England  yeah  I gotta  go to  England  I'm  gonna  just  step  across  whales  I'm  gonna  drive  my  little  fucking  jalopy  across  the  whales  exactly  but  so  then  they  that  was  they  were  safer  there  the  English  couldn't  get  at  them  they  said  fuck  it  we're  gonna  tell  yeah  and  then  it  became  this  port  because  people  were  so  farmers  in  upstate  New York  would  take  their  sheep  and  slaughter  them  in  Hudson  and  send  the  meat  down  river  to  New  York  city  so  fucking  primitive  yeah  it's  amazing 
[03:25:00]  drive  his  sheep  fuck  a  girl  or  a  sheep  yeah  it was  like  a  few  miles  out  of  Hudson  so  the  night  before  you  went  into  Hudson  to  sell  your  sheep  you'd  put  them  in  a  stable  and  fuck  a  whore  and  then  take  your  sheep  the  rest  of  the  way  home  great  little  system  I  know  everything  planned out  make  people  happy  exactly  keep  the  economy  going  there's  a  guy  that  had  an  experience  like 
[03:25:30]  you  did  that  you  just  told  steve  in  pennsylvania  steve  yeah  how you  doing  guys  good  evening  good  evening  yeah  capskill  new york  20 foot  bay liner  single screw  175 horse  i read  the tie  charts  my  business  partner  had  a  33  foot  carver  we  used  to  take  down  and  from  that  same  arena  go down  around  the  statue  come  back  it  was  a  great  time  so  I  bought  this  20  footer  night  my  two  girls  you 
[03:26:00]  know  young  at  real  young  at  the  time  and  I  took  off  you  know  big  shot  down  the  Hudson  beautiful  ride  and  I  got  down  to  that  area  that  you're  talking  about  I  was  doing  prop  stands  where  the  boat  was  just  almost  just  like  straight  up  the  front  of  the  boat  straight  up  motor  just  whining  I  finally  get  into  a  marina  because  I  needed  fuel  my  saw  them  running  off 
[03:26:30]  at  the  gas  station  guy  fuck  you  that  shit  is  gnarly  it's  really  fucking  bad  because  it's  New York  Harbor  Manhattan  people don't  understand  there is  no  Hudson  the Hudson's  not on the  west  and the  east  there's  no such  thing as  the east  river  that's  what people  don't  understand  it's  all in  New York  Harbor  it's a  harbor  of the  Atlantic  Ocean  right  that we  on the  left side  it looks  like a  river  so we  call  that  the  Hudson  river  and then  we  call  the  east  river  there's  Manhattan  island  in the  middle  of the  sloshy  crazy  icy  ocean 
[03:27:00]  yeah  is it  sea water  the Hudson's  sea water  no it's  certain times  a day  it's  salt water  yeah  it's like  salty  it pushes  salt water  water  it's where  yeah  watered  whatever the  fuck  and then  when it's  the rivers  running out  into the  ocean  it's  fresh water  yeah  and where  this guy  is  is  Catskill  there's  a harbor  there's a  little place  there where  you can  take your  boat in  and you  get  something  to eat  I mean  it's a  fun  world  the  boat  world  but  yeah  it really  is  what the  fuck  you're  doing  like  I  didn't  I 
[03:27:30]  do  you  know 
[03:28:00]  I  know  I  would  be  slamming  down  drinks  and stuff  you'd  be  making  mudslides  and  blenders  down  in the  kitchen  and this  thing  out of  a  galley  and  everything  and he'd  be hammered  and back  this  fucking  thing  into  slips  that  like  were  there's  no way  they're  amazing  they can  do  that  dual  screws  So he's running, like, the transmission to get the props going in opposite directions to turn the boat so he could swing the thing around and then back it into the slip.  Really, the first boat I had was a little orange, like, with a white steering wheel. 
[03:28:30]  Like, it just looked like a little race car, you know?  And it was a two-seat boat, like, really tiny little fiberglass boat that I saw on someone's yard for sale for $800.  And I was like, fuck it.  I'm going to just buy it.  And I just knocked on the guy's door, and he was like, really?  And I was like, yeah, I'll pay it.  And I gave him the $800 that's just sitting there on a trailer.  And then I'm like, well, now what do I do?  Like, from scratch.  And I had an old Ford Ranger pickup, and I went to the fucking Napa and bought the ball. 
[03:29:00]  Trailer hitch.  The trailer hitch.  And I got the wrong size and went back.  And then I put the fucking...  Already wrong.  Yeah, the guy watched from his window laughing as I tried to put a trailer hitch on a fucking truck.  It took me, like, an hour sweating.  And then I took it down to the Hudson, where they had to, you know, you back your boat down.  Oh, the Ram.  Yeah, and I have no idea how to do it or what to do.  How'd you do?  So there's an old man, literally an old, seaworthy-looking man with a white beard watching me do this. 
[03:29:30]  And I just decide I'm not just going to try.  So I just...  Oof.  It takes me hours to line it up, because when you're backing something with a trailer, it jackknights on you.  Yes, yes.  It's backwards.  All of your instincts are wrong.  Let me tell you, I had a jet ski, and I had the same problem until somebody told me,  put your hand on the bottom of the steering wheel, and wherever you want the back end of the trailer to go,  your hand, let your hand go that way.  So instead of trying to think right, left, you just, I want the trailer to go this way, I move my hand that way. 
[03:30:00]  And if it's on the bottom of the steering wheel, and then it got to the point where I could do it with my eyes closed after a while.  Well, I backed it down, and also, the boat is strapped hard to a trailer, and the plug is out in the back of it.  That's how you keep a boat.  Right, yeah.  You keep it strapped down to the trailer with the plug in the back.  Now, what I know now is the way you launch a boat, and then it's tethered in the front by a winch.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[03:30:30]  So the way you do it is you let go of the strap, you take the straps off, so it's just loose only,  held on by the winch, and you put a plug in the back of the boat, so that when the trailer goes into the water,  the wheels of the trailer go down in the water, and the boat floats on top of the water.  But what I was doing was, it's held to the trailer, so the trailer's dragging the boat, and it immediately fills with water.  It completely fills with water.  And it's also, because it now weighs billions of tons, threatening to drag my fucking truck into the water. 
[03:31:00]  And I'm fucking, I am peeling out.  What's Popeye doing watching you?  Is he laughing at you?  I'm losing my mind.  A little bit of a panic setting?  He's just watching, and I have the car floored, the truck floored.  And the wheels are going, just trying to hold ground?  Just trying not to, because it's just a shitty rear wheel drive.  And the rear wheels are now in water, and I've just got water shooting everywhere, and smoke,  and now the tailpipe is starting to go in.  Like, I'm going in the fucking water.  And somehow, somehow I found some traction somewhere in there, 
[03:31:30]  and the whole truck, like, lurched forward, and this screaming wheels.  And the boat came out, gung, gung, with water just flashing.  It was the craziest spectacle.  And I stopped, and I look up at the guy, and he goes, try again.  He goes, what'd you learn?  What'd you learn?  That's great, you motherfucker.  And so I got out of the truck, and I'm like, okay, there's a plug in the back  that was dumb to keep it strapped.  I said all this out loud, and he's going, uh-huh. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, good.  And he goes, he said, you know what?  The guy said to me, you're going to be having the time of your life in about half an hour.  And I waited for the boat to empty out, put the plug in,  and if he was right, in half an hour, I was on the fucking river.  Owning a boat.  This is great.  With beer.  Owning a boat sucks.  Yeah, with beer.  Yeah, I'll never do it again.  Boy, how do you get it back onto the trailer?  Like, what if there's people there?  You have to, no, you have, yeah, if there's people there waiting, like expert boaters.  They'll start yelling at you. 
[03:32:30]  They hate you.  They're not going to be happy.  They will fucking yell at you.  The thing I can't do that those guys do is just fucking drive my boat back onto the thing  and then run up to the top of it and winch it.  You back the trailer into the water.  Yeah.  Where's your boat while you do that?  Your boat is kind of tied up, yeah, on the side by the dock.  You back in, you quickly, you're running now because you don't want to be the guy.  You get in your boat, you fucking give it a little juice and up onto the trailer.  That's kind of halfway submerged. 
[03:33:00]  That's what you're supposed to do.  Yeah.  I don't have the skills, so I would use the ropes of the boat.  You got to cut back and pull it onto the trailer.  We're using block and tackle?  Yes, exactly.  And my feet are now in water getting cut on the bottom of the fucking river.  They're really smooth by the ramps.  People throw their beer cans and bottles.  And I've gotten my fingers are bleeding and I'm grunting and there's a guy standing on  his boat with his hands on his hips.  Yeah, yeah.  Just fucking hating me.  All right, come on.  I used to wait for a can't back it up guy. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  They were the worst because you knew it wasn't going to get any faster once it got into the  water.  No.  And it's like, and you could see him trying to figure out if the back of my truck is  going left, the trailer's going right, all right, I got to do this.  And then it's going off the side of the ramp, so he's got to vroom, go forward again,  and you're just going, come on!  Come on!  You're just looking at your watch.  Time is wasting.  The sun's going down.  You fucking want to get out there.  God damn it.  And once that guy told me, with the hand on the bottom of the wheel, and then that, I 
[03:34:00]  would hang out the window of my truck and just look backwards, not even use the mirror  because you couldn't really see.  No, the mirror doesn't help.  That, yeah.  And just look out the back and steer it right in there.  That's really smart.  And then getting in was the same thing.  I'd back it up, take the jet ski and just wah, right up onto the trailer.  You clip the front winch thing on there, and don't even winch it all the way up.  Now, drive that fucker off the ramp and take care of your shit in the parking lot. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.  Because there are guys that strap their shit down on the ramp.  Yeah, they're putting beers back in a cooler.  You could fucking do that in a parking space, you prick.  There's a guy, Cole Shoveler, from Richmond.  He writes, tell Louie that there are old, retired guys that sit down by the boat ramps  just to watch people like him and laugh at them.  That's a hobby for these guys.  There's sharing beers, laughing.  The boat world is interesting because there's two kinds of people.  There are these sort of anarchist, fuck the world people that you literally, you can tell  they live on their boat and they hate you just for floating by and for not being them. 
[03:35:00]  And they literally, they don't pay taxes.  They live on, you know what I mean?  They're just off the grid boat people.  And then there's these people that are holding on to this idea that they're Mr. and Mrs.  Howell, these fucking people.  Because in Hudson, this town I'm describing is a dump.  It's all unemployed.  There's no business up there.  They have a boat club right on the river.  And they're taking up the whole fucking river with their docks.  Why don't you come down to the boat club when you're done?  Yeah, so I thought maybe I'll rent a dock from them so I don't have to launch every time.  So they have all these empty spaces.  There's just no boats there.  So I go in this shitty, shitty looking boat club. 
[03:35:30]  It's just a fucking dump.  It's like a fucking, like a small airport, you know?  Yeah.  Like Syracuse airport or something.  And I go in there and there's these people in white sweaters and white shorts.  And I go, do you rent the docks?  We're yachting.  You have to become a member and you have to, you can't become a member if you don't, yeah.  Here's some production for you.  You need a reference to become a member.  A reference.  Tell us a little about yourself.  And I'm like, I make more than all you motherfuckers.  You motherfuckers.  Yeah, well. 
[03:36:00]  Are you, you, this guy owns a fucking local car dealership, maybe?  Yeah.  And this cunt owns a Cumberland Farms?  That's where they go to feel important and rich.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, I'm famous, you motherfuckers.  My word.  Show people.  Not in our club.  My goodness.  How much is it to rent a little space to park your boat?  A slip.  It's by the foot and up there.  They wouldn't let me.  They just wouldn't let me because I'm not a member of their community.  We know you're part Mexican. 
[03:36:30]  Exactly.  I don't remember what it costs.  I don't remember.  In New Jersey, it's vastly cheaper than New York City.  You're like, every hour, you're sweating the hours.  It's by the hour and it's by the foot and it's tons of money.  In New York, you can't just rent and keep your boats all the time?  Well, if you're rich, yeah.  And there's like some, like the 79th Street boat basin.  There's a few marinas down there.  That's a public something, but that's about waiting lists and stuff like that.  How much do you think they are?  I mean, is it like, you know, 50 bucks a day?  I mean, I have no kind of.  I don't even remember. 
[03:37:00]  I never rented in New York.  It's probably so much more expensive than having a monthly parking thing in a garage.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  A lot of people pull them out during the winter and dry dock.  Yeah.  It's the cheaper that way.  What's dry dock mean?  You go, you play.  It's not in the water.  Yeah, it's not in the water.  But where do you dry dock at?  It's usually a boat yard.  Yeah, a boat yard or an indoor warehouse.  But then they actually take them on these big lifts and stack them on shelves in these  warehouses or outside. 
[03:37:30]  They wrap them in plastic and shrink wrap.  And then they stack them.  Yeah.  I always thought they were new boats for sale.  I've seen those before.  It's a new boat for sale.  I'll have that one.  Yeah.  And they stack them up and it's cheaper and it doesn't get as damaged.  You don't have to worry about hurricanes.  Dry docking.  It could be a lot worse.  Yes.  Dry docking.  There's another one.  Yeah.  Another definition.  Two unclipped men in heat.  One with prostate problems.  Dry docking. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  So they'll wrap your boat in plastic.  Do they come and get it off the marina for you or are you going to bring it to them?  I think they come and get it.  I don't know.  You need a truck to like.  You ever see those giant trucks with giant ships on the expressway?  Yes.  And you're driving just going, what the fuck?  Yes.  What is that?  That has no business being on the road.  How big is like a good size yacht?  Like a good size fucking rich guy yacht?  Well, geez, they just, they get so huge.  You get over, you start getting over 50 feet and you're talking like you, you better know 
[03:38:30]  how to fucking drive this thing and with everything.  No.  You got to know how to back it in.  You have someone else driving it.  By the way, you know how I got back to New York, back to Hudson because it was pitch black  and some of that.  I brought, I took the, the GPS out of my car with a suction cup.  That's what kind of had back then.  And I stuck it.  I swear to God, it's the smartest thing I ever did.  No shit.  And I stuck it on the boat and it fucking took me, it knew the contour of the river.  Wow.  The GPS is like, dude, you're not on a road.  I can't get you anywhere.  Didn't have you take the fucking FDR. 
[03:39:00]  But this is where you are.  For your information, I don't know why you're here, but you're here.  And there was a few times that it saved me because I couldn't fucking see and I wasn't  sure what part of it.  But it doesn't tell you where the rocks are.  Well, and also you can't, you know, you have to stay within a boating.  It's like him and Henry Fonda fishing his lanes.  There's a boating channel and you have to stay within it, but sometimes you lose the  buoys and you don't, you, you knew.  And I did have a chart.  Like I can read a chart and I know where a boating channel is, but I couldn't see.  I didn't know how far I was from either shore.  It's, it's, I'm in the middle of fucking.  It's that dark out there.  There's a bay, there's a bay right after the Tappan Zee, if you're going north, something 
[03:39:30]  bay that's just enormous.  And you literally, you really can't see the left to the right.  So you feel like you're in the ocean and it gets really scary.  And you can get turned around.  And the GPS fucking told me right where I was.  And it, and there was times where I was headed towards fucking land that I couldn't see  because it was just car GPS, my car GPS got me back to Hudson.  It probably says specifically not to be used for maritime or aviation use.  Well, you can load them there.  There's, you can load them with those GPSs with maritime maps. 
[03:40:00]  You can.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I didn't have that.  I use the car, get you home in your car map.  I tell you, the first thing I ever did, and this was horrifically stupid, I bought a  Sea-Doo, a two-seater, you know, sit-down jet ski, a water, personal water craft, which  obviously I couldn't afford.  That's another story.  Yeah.  No, by the way, I was, I know these boats I bought instead of groceries.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  Part of why I'm not married anymore.  Things like that. 
[03:40:30]  The one thing I'll cop to is that I did really dumb things with my money, my whole life.  They wound up giving me a $10,000 credit line credit card.  Nice.  Because I had gotten a $5,000 one and maxed it out, but I was paying the minimum, so they  just sent me another one and said, hey, here's an application.  I filled it out, and I had some credit limit was $10,000.  You're a perfect customer.  Now I got a $10,000 credit limit thing.  So I went right down to the fucking place where they sell personal water craft, bought a  Sea-Doo and a trailer. 
[03:41:00]  The whole thing came out to like $8,000, so I still had two grand left on my credit  card.  Jesus.  And I'm paying 25% interest on jet ski and stuff.  Believe me, it was a nightmare, but I had time of my life on that fucking thing.  Of course.  Can you jet ski on the Hudson or no?  Yeah, I've seen them out there, yeah.  I've seen them a lot, actually.  Where I went, though, I wanted to get out to Watch Hill on Fire Island, so I drove out  to Patchogue early in the morning, and I crossed the Great South Bay, and it was pea soup fog. 
[03:41:30]  I couldn't see shit.  I ripped a chart.  I went into a store where they sold boating charts and Hagstrom maps and looked for the  page I needed and looked around and just tore it out and put it in my pocket, and I had a  compass, and every two minutes, I'd pull out the chart and the compass, line up which direction  I was supposed to go, and just keep going, wah, wah, wah, wah, through fog, and I could 
[03:42:00]  have been broadsided by a boat at any minute, because I couldn't see, and then right when  the fog broke, I didn't know where I was going to end up.  I couldn't possibly think this was going to work.  It said, welcome to Watch Hill.  I pegged it.  Fucking nailed Watch Hill from Patchogue.  Isn't that satisfying, though?  Didn't you feel good?  It was like, I worked, but I only did it once, so I don't know if it worked, or I just got  really fucking lucky.  I would have just kicked it home and hoped for the best. 
[03:42:30]  That's the difference between you and I.  Going one direction.  Yeah.  Every two minutes.  And then when you become hyper-aware, how much fucking fuel do I have?  How much did I put in?  You start thinking shit like this, because I would stop the jet ski, so I'd just be  kind of bobbing in the water, and I'd have to chart out in the compass, and I'd look around  and look down into the water, and I can't see anything.  I'm like, I don't know where I am, man.  Jesus.  I have no fucking idea if I'm heading.  Those are weird moments when you're like, I don't know how this is going to end up. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's an adventure.  This is how people, and you think this is how people die.  Yeah, exactly.  They find them dead.  I used to say to myself in weird situations like that, stuff like, hurry, but don't worry.  Like, don't.  Hurry, but don't worry.  Just try to go fast without your hands shaking.  Yeah.  If you can.  I was in Antigua once doing a show in Antigua.  Oh, it's looking great.  And I took a jet ski, and I said, how far out can I go?  It was kind of a big jet ski, and this bored woman said, you have to stay between these two 
[03:43:30]  buoys.  But she didn't say how far out I could go.  Yeah.  So I just kept going out further and further and further away until, like, the land is  like a little brown strip behind me.  Oh, shit.  And I'm not really, I don't know nothing about water.  So this is before I had boats or anything.  And I'm starting to go up these gentle rises and then down in these valleys.  And I'm not really aware of how that they're getting bigger.  Holy shit.  And I don't know how ocean, I'm in the Caribbean Sea.  You're in the fucking ocean, dude.  Which makes it harder to see the land now. 
[03:44:00]  Yes.  And now, so then at one point, the last one I remember seeing was that I went...  A perfect storm wave.  I went down, yeah, it was like that, that I was going down into this valley of water,  and I look, and all around me is blue water.  Oh.  And I'm going to look up, and I just see blue water just really gentle.  It's being very fucking with me.  It was tricking you.  It was tricking you.  It was calling you.  Then I'm climbing one, and I'm going a little bit fucking vertical, and I don't know what  this is.  And then I go over the top and just fall. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Me and the jet ski just fall in two different people.  Holy shit.  And hit really hard, and then it all swallows me up.  And I'm fucking in huge stinging pain.  My elbow, like I fucking injured it, like I just couldn't...  And then I come up, and the jet ski's in three pieces.  Oh, fuck.  What did you do?  Three pieces.  The seat, the body is bobbing around.  The seat is... 
[03:45:00]  Somewhere over there.  Over there, and then the handlebars, which have foam rubber on them, are going up and  down, like they're about to sink.  And I look, and now that my head, now that my eyes are two inches above the water, I can't  see.  Dude, you're so fucked.  I can't see land, nothing.  Holy shit.  And I'm thinking, what, sharks?  I don't know what this is.  Of course.  And then, and I realized I'm really fucked.  And, you know, I had the thing around my wrist that pulled the key out.  The little lanyard, yeah, that stops the jet ski.  And thank God that held, and I held it.  I was like, my fingers hurt for how hard I was holding the keys, because it was like 
[03:45:30]  life.  And I swam to the seat.  I just had, like, bob in there.  I'm like, gotta...  Don't tell me you put this fucker back together.  I need a plan.  So I swam for those handlebars first.  God, they're really heavy, because they're underwater.  I'm trying to hold them above the water, so they don't wait, so that they're hard.  I'm dragging them through water.  And then I swam to the seat, I think.  And then I got to the thing itself.  You were able to put the whole thing back together?  But I threw the seat back up, and I sat up there. 
[03:46:00]  Now I'm just sitting, and I'm still going up and down and up and down.  It's hard, too.  When that thing's not running, it's very hard to keep it level.  Yeah, the momentum keeps you going straight.  Yeah, it's like a bicycle.  If you're not moving on a jet ski or a personal watercraft, the thing just wants to tip over  and throw you off.  But somehow I put the handle...  I jiggered the handlebars in there.  Oh, please.  It's a nice show up until now.  I'm sorry.  Wait, you didn't need a screwdriver or anything, right? 
[03:46:30]  No.  There's a gentleman going by on a boat, and I jiggered.  Never mind.  Yeah.  There's no way you got this thing started again.  I put it together, and I put the thing back on, the kill switch, and I took a fucking breath,  and I hit that ignition.  The ignition's on the handlebars.  Isn't the ignition only on the handlebars?  Yeah, I don't remember how...  Do you have to plug something in?  No, no, no.  It was on the body underneath the handlebars.  Wait, the kill switch is when your wrist pulls it out, this prevents it from going away. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  It kills the motor.  So I put the kill switch thing back on, and then I just took a breath and said something  to myself, like there's no, I can't pretend there's a God now, I never thought there was  one before, so I'm not going to be a hypocrite and ask for help.  I just fucking hope this shit starts.  And I think I might be dying today, and I started it, and it started, and I just carefully went,  and I went up, it was kind of gnarly.  Because now you've got to go back up one of the waves, right? 
[03:47:30]  It wasn't as bad going, I must have hit some weird...  Like a road wave, they call it.  Because it wasn't as bad once I fell off the thing, and it wasn't as bad going back.  It was one of those just...  My head was fucking burning, and I was also just getting sunburned by the second.  Let me tell you something.  When I came back, the woman's waiting for me, equally bored, and I didn't say nothing.  I just fucking parked it and said, got my little license back.  It's all broken.  You know, it's...  Thank you, and what...  Jesus, you didn't even tell her.  I didn't tell her.  People say you should be dead.  It's easier on a jet ski to hit a wave head on. 
[03:48:00]  Right.  Because you kind of cut through it.  Where the direction of the wave is coming at you, it's easier to go that way than to go  with the wave.  With the wave, you will fall off the other side of it.  When you're going over a wave and it's coming at you, you jump it, and you kind of have  a landing ramp behind the wave, where the wave then tapers into water.  That's what you're supposed to do, yeah.  So when you go with the wave, that's when I noticed you fucking...  You fall.  Especially if you're going real fast, holy shit, you fall.  Wham! 
[03:48:30]  I've jarred my back where I felt like I was two inches shorter when you hit the bottom.  By the way, the boat I took to New York, the thing I found out later, again, and all  in retrospect, is that that boat has a cathedral hull.  Which means it's a flat...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's not a...  A nice V-hull.  It's not a V that's cutting through waves.  It's this thing that's just pounding, just slapping.  It's like a hand.  It's made from a hand that's just slapping waves.  It's made as a river boat.  Yes.  Where...  Not a title boat.  And it's a flat bottom.  Yeah.  A boat that's going to go through some waves, you want a V-hull on it.  Yes. 
[03:49:00]  Nice.  Or a dual V.  The opposite of the kind of boat I wanted.  Yeah, yeah.  You had the opposite.  It would have been better to capsize your boat and ride on the bottom of it.  Than to kill my father the way I did.  Poor dad.  It's a jet ski.  Like, you should get one, basically, if you have, like, a big pool.  And just zip around on a nice circle.  Yeah.  Vroom.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Club Soda Kenny is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  I was just requested by E-Rock to do another one of those because he's producing this. 
[03:49:30]  And the person called D-Boy is the technical guy behind this who's having a problem with  me not using the windscreen.  Because I can pop peas like nobody can.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  One man come in the name of love. 
[03:50:00]  One man come and go.  One come he to justify.  One man to overthrow.  In the name of love.  What more in the name of love.  In the name of love.  What more in the name of love. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  Staging the virus.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Club Soda Kenny.  We're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Um, you know who.  Club Soda Kenny.  Girasshole Park.  While discussing how important Kenny is to the program, Jim brings up that Kenny's head  looks like that of a brontosaurus. 
[03:51:00]  Kenny is then compared to the movie Jurassic Park.  I think dinosaurs are very scary.  I'm glad I wasn't a caveman.  And let me ask you this.  You know why cavemen dragged women by their hair instead of by their ankles?  So they didn't fill up with dirt and rocks.  Broadcast with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, it's some good TV.  I'm not talking about him.  I'm talking about the man carrying my smoothie.  That's right. 
[03:51:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  Kenny gets my smoothie right now.  Like, every time.  Kenny knows, man.  Kenny makes a mistake.  Full of banana-y goodness.  Guys, do you think it's smart to talk about Bubba?  Oh, my God.  Did he really say that?  Oh, God.  Who said that?  You know, sometimes you've got to make alliances.  Who said do you think it's smart to talk about Bubba?  What do you think?  You said that?  Yeah.  Why would you say that? 
[03:52:00]  G.H., I probably do not know what I'm talking about,  and I will probably get a bashing for this, but I can't help myself.  Are you going to choke me?  No, I'm giving you your food.  Because I know one day you will.  I just hope it's not today.  What is cock?  Is it a good idea to address this now?  Please do not get mad at me for putting my two cents in.  And if you would rather that I not comment, please let me know.  Thanks.  Take care.  Well, why would it be bad to mention Bubba?  How would that be bad?  Well, they're over there at a company that is merging. 
[03:52:30]  You guys might not be included.  You know, there's every possibility you could be destitute, so you better play it safe.  He's just looking out for us.  We're too stupid to take anyone's advice, even if it's good advice.  The guy's a fucking cunt who mouthed off about us.  And if everything he said comes true and we get the boot, so be it. 
[03:53:00]  He could have a chuckle about it, and that's great.  But it ain't going to stop us from calling the guy what he is.  A hack.  No one's fucking paying attention to him.  And screw him.  I only want the best for you boys.  I understand.  You're like the angel on one shoulder, and then there's the devil on the other shoulder.  Right.  And the devil is throwing flames at your hair because he knows it's going to catch right on fire  and burn your little halo. 
[03:53:30]  All right.  I got another mission to attend to.  What's your mission?  I have to take care of something.  Ah, yeah.  Guarding Tess.  What are you going to do?  He's got to go walk the perimeter.  Somebody needs something attended to.  Secured?  No, no, no.  I got to get something fixed.  Fixed?  Yeah.  You getting a chin implant?  Yeah.  I wish.  Sorry.  Vasectomy.  That's kind of like fixed.  No, that don't work either. 
[03:54:00]  No need to waste money.  What do you hate on your body?  Everything.  Oh.  No, come on.  What's the one thing you hate the most?  It's my profile.  I got a half moon profile, big nose, no chin.  Yeah, yeah.  Very little head, because I got very small brains in them.  Oh, God.  Even when he said it, he sold it.  It's a cute head, though, when it cocks back when he's sleeping.  That head just leans back on top of it.  Oh, I know.  But right where it's supposed to have a little more mass, it just doesn't. 
[03:54:30]  No, just papers.  Anyone else notice that?  Like a brontosaurus head.  That's why Kenny never eats lunch with us, because he's always out finding a tree, and  just handlessly enjoying some leaves.  G.H., I'm going to be late.  I'm stuck in a tar pit.  Or I'm extinct.  Exactly.  Wow, yeah.  That would be the early stage of being extinct.  Yeah.  He doesn't like Travis.  He looks like a little velociraptor. 
[03:55:00]  velociraptor, I'm scared of him.  I'm a mere vegetarian.  When all these other dinosaurs are carnivorous, they use me for food.  I could be eaten.  Dinosaur.  Your asshole park.  That's where Kenny is.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  I'm going to take care of that.  Ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:55:30]  Club Soda Kenny is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lewis C.K.  Kids.  Rich Voss in studio.  Lewis talks about his kids and how hard it is raising them.  They talk about stupid kid voice parents due to their kids.  I personally love to talk baby talk.  Broadcasting.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Club Soda Kenny.  I love it depressing.  Pamela just called me.  She got my sweater back.  The rich sweater from Lucky Louie had been sold off.  Do they sell your assets immediately to get divorced? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, no.  We had to get all our clothes.  And Pamela bought my sweater.  I got my sweater for myself.  That's right.  I can wear that.  Now when prostitutes come over, I can hope they recognize me.  I can go, hey, I'm nude in my sweater.  Member.  Member.  What do they do with it?  They just sell it to people who will use it for whatever.  Like Homeless?  Or other.  So there's a company called It's a Wrap.  And they just buy everything that a TV show, a dead TV show had.  It's a Wrap.  It's a Wrap, yeah.  And then what do they do with it? 
[03:56:30]  They liquidate it.  I don't know what they would have gotten for that sweater, you know.  But do they sell it?  If there's any iconic stuff, they would put it on eBay and stuff like that.  That's what I was thinking.  So they sell it to fans and stuff?  Yeah.  So I took all my work shirts and stuff.  I got to tell you guys, wherever I go, man.  I was in Rochester for a few days and a lot of Lucky Louie fans up there.  And people you would never expect, like, you know, proper women that don't have a dirty  mind.  And I'm like, what?  That's the weird thing.  It's mostly older people.  There's always older, in New York, every corner I'm waiting for a red light, some older Jewish  woman puts her hand on my chest kind of sexually and says, you are wonderful, like old Jewish 
[03:57:00]  ladies and old black couples, well-dressed, come up to me and say that they love the show  and then take my wallet and stuff.  That was the problem.  You just needed white people.  I didn't expect a lot of white people to enjoy the show.  There's more white people in America.  I didn't expect the soccer moms.  No, yeah.  I just didn't.  You know, and that's what I see a lot.  They come up and go, oh, that show is so honest and the language, it was real.  Well, when I started doing material about having a family on stage, I thought I was going to 
[03:57:30]  get booed for the stuff I was going to say because I did it out of frustration.  I didn't think it would make me successful.  I was going on stage and saying stuff like, now that I have a baby, I understand babies  in the garbage, like I don't, I wouldn't do it, but for the first time I get it, like  I totally visualize it.  And it's true.  Every parent, actually, your head goes to like, okay, what would, who would know?  Like how many people have seen this baby?  I'm like, oh, yeah, they got her footprint at the hospital.  I forget it now.  It's not going to.  Could I explain it away? 
[03:58:00]  They're going to come around.  Hey, what happened?  What?  We didn't have a baby.  What are you talking about?  But so I would do jokes about that and I thought I'd just get booed and I was just doing it  for my own.  And soccer moms would come up to me after shows.  Sure.  And say, thank you for doing this stuff.  Thank you.  I did kill my baby.  I threw my baby in the garbage.  I didn't realize how funny it is that I did so.  Louie, what's the most frustrating thing about being a parent?  I think it's the spouse.  I think if I was alone, I'd be fine.  Alone with a kid?  Yeah.  Seriously. 
[03:58:30]  I got two.  And I can think, I sort of think in my head, because you do the virtual reality, okay,  my wife dies and the kids are still around, you know, get a nanny.  I mean, I could do it.  Wait till your kid turns 16 and stays out all night drinking and lies at 16.  Oh, boy.  The only thing that would be better is if I dropped her off.  Yeah.  All night long going from party to party.  Is that what's happening with the hot Voss daughter?  Yeah, no, I haven't had any. 
[03:59:00]  I haven't started.  That's a whole new level where the person actually has a life that you have to worry about.  Right.  And to me, I have two girls, so I just don't want them to depend on guys.  That's all.  I really don't care if they're hookers as long as, I guess that is depending on guys.  Yeah.  In a big way.  Hookers are not really independent of spirits.  No.  But, no, the hard part is when they're babies, it's that you don't sleep and you really get  on edge and you want to kill people.  Yeah.  And, but I don't, there's endless reservoir of energy for the kids. 
[03:59:30]  I mean, they're, they're, they're crappy people.  They don't care about you.  It's a one-way relationship.  They're mean-spirited.  They smell bad too.  A lot of the time, like my daughter won't bathe and we have a baby, so we can't force  her anymore.  Like we just go fine, just sleep in your clothes.  Nobody cares anymore.  But she starts to stink.  Like she's got this little girl vagina smell that is kind of really, it's really hard to  take.  It's really hard.  It's disgusting.  Do you have an Arab kid?  What's that?  Well, if any kid, you don't wash them. 
[04:00:00]  They stink.  The reality of the reality is there's not much joy, right?  When they're young.  Well, but there is.  There's enough that it does makes all that worth it.  It doesn't bother me.  Like she's, she'll be really rude to me.  And I just, I'm, I think it's funny and I'm proud of her.  I want her to be rude and, uh, self-expressive.  I want her to take from people and, uh, crap on them and abuse them.  Cause that's how you get ahead in the world.  I can never understand when I see a father with especially daughter, young, young daughters, 
[04:00:30]  uh, in a store or anywhere.  And they go into that baby talk thing and it's like, Jesus Christ, this is a grown man  who is now, you know, he was probably into, you know, he was under the hood of his car  turning a wrench at some point with his buddies drinking beers.  And now he's gooby baby.  No, no, baby.  No, darling.  We can't do that.  No, no.  And you just look and go, what happened to you?  Yeah.  No, I don't talk to my daughters that way.  No.  They, no.  I just talk to them like, cause that's stupid. 
[04:01:00]  It's retarded.  It really is.  Your kid, it talks like a baby cause your kid is stupid and your kid doesn't know how  to make real words yet.  Your kid sucks at talking.  So you're going to teach them by talking like them.  Yeah.  How dumb is that?  Like parents that take their kids words.  Do you want Mickey, milky, Mickey, Mickey?  Say milk.  So the kid learns how to say milk so they can get a job.  Don't retard their verbal development by talking like them.  The only people you should just baby talk on are the elderly. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Just to humiliate them.  Well, there was a little kid in my neighbor, a little black kid, and his uncle, you remember  Froggy from Courageous Cat to talk like that?  No.  The uncle.  No, you remember Froggy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, hold on.  You're not just saying.  Was that a talkie?  Did you just make up that cartoon?  No, Courageous Cat.  You remember Courageous Cat?  No.  I'm going to tell you a good story.  I don't remember Froggy.  You watched cartoons when they were in black and white, didn't you?  Steamboat Willie.  Jesus.  Was that on a flip card thing? 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  It was a flip book.  He put a penny in the Nickelodeon thing and cranked it.  Turned his cap on backwards.  How old are you?  Are you serious?  You don't know Courageous Cat in a minute.  I remember the name, yes.  Yeah, I don't remember ever watching it.  But I'm Froggy, Rich.  He was one of the characters.  He was one of the criminals.  And how did he sound?  You're like, see, man.  Like Muggsy.  Muggsy.  That was the...  Oh, my God. 
[04:02:30]  You know, if I close my eyes.  Yeah.  It's Froggy.  Froggy.  He'd have a cigar in his mouth.  Yeah, I think Pixar is doing a Froggy movie.  He's such a popular character.  Why am I being attacked from a show I watch?  I'll tell you why you're being attacked.  Tell Louie what that event in New Orleans is.  Mardi Gras.  How do you spell it?  M-A-R-D-I-G-R-A.  Mardi Gras.  You finally...  All right, look.  He looked the word up during the break.  He looked it up.  What did I say before?  He said Mardi Gras and Madrigra.  No.  And he spelled it M-A-D-R-I. 
[04:03:00]  Oh, you're out of your mind.  I said M-A-R-D-I.  No, you didn't.  Oh, my.  You don't think we tape this show every day?  I know you do.  It's on tape, my friend.  It's on tape.  How much do you want to bet?  I'll take bets right now.  How much do you want to bet?  You spelled it M-A-D-R-I.  I'll bet you.  I got a hundred right now.  No, I can't gamble because I quit gambling.  Oh, that's right.  M-A-R-D-I.  Oh, you're lucky.  Come on.  That is the easiest money I would make.  It's not like drinking or drugs.  It's gambling.  You can stop in a second.  No, I can't.  Come on.  You said Mardi Gras and we asked you and you said Madrigra.  Madrigra.  Imagine if that's how you tumbled back down because of that bet. 
[04:03:30]  Just one bet.  You just said...  Back to smoking crack.  I was sure I said Mardi and I lost the bet and I had to go make up for it at the OTB.  And Bonnie left me three months later.  It would take a week for Voss to be on his knees pleasuring someone for a vial.  I was so nervous because of a word he misspelled.  Because he misspelled a word.  People are saying here it's the frog you tool.  Froggy was from our gang.  A frog or froggy. 
[04:04:00]  Whatever.  If you talk to him...  The frog you tool.  If you talk to him in past tense, it was froggy.  All right.  So let's get to your story.  Well, it doesn't matter.  This is how old this cartoon was.  The character was just called the frog.  The first frog ever on a cartoon.  It wasn't Kermit the frog or froggy.  No.  Just the frog.  The frog.  And people were fascinated by it back then.  A frog who speaks.  It's a frog.  How do they do it?  All right.  So what happened with the frog?  What happened?  We were talking about kids and how you talk baby talk.  It sounded good.  The kid. 
[04:04:30]  The uncle.  As the doughboys.  We're headed to Europe.  Froggy makes the movie screen.  Yeah, see?  The uncle would talk to the kid in that voice.  The little kid.  And the kid grew up.  He would talk regular and then break into that voice.  Like froggy.  Yeah, but not know it.  That's how he really talked.  He would go from talking like a real person into froggy.  Jesus, God, please let this story have an ending. 
[04:05:00]  Please.  I'm praying.  Well, at least, God, let it see.  Have some kind of ending, see?  Nah.  Nah.  Say?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Just pat.  Hop.  Hop.  Hop.  And then this kid grew up and he bought a club in Philly called Helium.  No, I don't know.  You tased Rich.  I sure did.  That frog story.  It could be the, I've heard Al Zorkawi stories that had funnier endings in that. 
[04:05:30]  Why don't you hop on out of here because we're done with you today.  That's right.  First of all, let me explain something.  Every store doesn't have to have a punchline when you're talking about kids and you're talking  a punchline.  I'm not saying it should have a punchline.  I got, well, I got a little water in my mouth on that one.  Okay, let's come after me.  Take your lily pad and get the hell out of here.  We're done with you.  I'm not saying it should have a punchline.  I don't mean it.  Okay.  I just meant it was just kind of meandering and it went from like, eh, into boof.  Why don't you go play Frogger in traffic? 
[04:06:00]  How many frog jokes can we get out?  Plenty.  I don't know.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  I'm boss, eh?  Hey, Kenny, if Rich is hungry, get us some flies.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  All right.  That's a terrific story.  Thanks.  Frog was a queer.  Let's say hi to Rich.  He has an apology for Louis C.K.  Rich Voss.  Rich in New Hampshire.  I have an apology for everybody.  He has an apology for XM Canada and, oh, go ahead, Rich.  Outside a toilet store with a mouth full of polywogs. 
[04:06:30]  Wow.  Horrible.  There you go.  Meandering mess.  There you go.  You never disappoint, Rich.  Thank you.  Love Rich.  You never disappoint.  Mouth full of polywogs.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's stuck.  Oh, that was a gem. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, right.  Should we go to New Hampshire?  Yeah, let's talk to Rich.  Let's talk to Rich.  Yeah, hey.  What's up, man?  I just want to apologize to Louis there.  Yeah, what for?  Oh, I fell asleep at one of his comedy shows up in Massachusetts at the Kowloon, and my  wife was telling me that he kept on looking over at me, and, well, I feel really bad about  it now.  All right, hold on, Rich.  I got to stick up for Louis here.  He didn't fall asleep because you were having a bad set.  Oh, well. 
[04:07:30]  He passed out.  He drank too much.  He drank too much.  He passed out of your show.  Yeah, no.  I just want to apologize for falling asleep at his show.  Nothing that he did.  I mean, I enjoy his comedy.  He's great.  Dude, dude, what we're saying is it's not falling asleep.  Up there it is.  Up in New England, like it is.  I just fell asleep.  It's called passing out from alcohol.  There's a difference.  It's not falling asleep.  No comic wants to hear that you fell asleep at his show.  Guy makes it sound like he took both of his hands, put them together like he's praying,  and put his cheek on him at the table. 
[04:08:00]  They don't mind hearing that you passed out at one of his shows.  Guy was drooling on his chicken wings.  He fell asleep like Alex in Clockwork Orange and the Spaghetti.  That was how he fell asleep.  Yeah.  I tried the wine.  All right.  No, you don't have to apologize for something I was completely unaware of.  Oh, okay.  Well, hey, no.  I think that I do anyways.  That's just me.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you very much for coming to see me at the Kowloon.  I got to cut you short because this is the $100 I would have won. 
[04:08:30]  In the Mardi Gras.  You know how they have the heads on the stick.  In the what?  In the Mardi Gras.  The heads on the stick.  How do you spell Mardi Gras?  M-A-D-R-I.  Mardi Gras?  Mother Gras?  How do you spell M-A-D-R-I?  Mardi Gras.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  M-A-D-R-I.  Mardi.  Wow.  Mardi Gras.  You're not a real person.  You're not a real person.  There you go.  From earlier.  There you go, Rich.  Here's the deal.  It was early and I wasn't really awake.  The case is rested.  How early is it that you spell Mardi Gras, M-A-D-R-I? 
[04:09:00]  I made a mistake, okay?  What's the big deal?  Wow.  Only that you said that you didn't.  Right.  That was it.  That's all.  If you said, yeah, I made the mistake, but then you totally went, I did not say it like  that.  Pull the tape.  Yeah, they could tamper with tapes, too.  You should have done that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, of course.  Somebody was back there cutting.  All right.  Whatever.  That's Jesus.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Club Soda Kenny is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.
