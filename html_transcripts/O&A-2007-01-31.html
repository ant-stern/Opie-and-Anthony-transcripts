<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in crude jokes about sex and violence, before Opie detailed a bizarre ailment he dubbed "the gulpies," characterized by persistent throat discomfort and an 18-hour episode of uncontrollable flatulence.  He then recounted his frustrating experience installing Microsoft Vista, highlighting his unsuccessful troubleshooting attempts and a difficult call to Microsoft customer service hampered by language barriers.  The conversation then turned to the newly published nude photos of Daniel Radcliffe, prompting a listener call-in segment where listeners were instructed to report their first viewing of the images.  The hosts speculated on Radcliffe's motivations and the media's response, while also discussing the Police's Grammy reunion and their concerns about Van Halen's upcoming reunion, particularly David Lee Roth's vocal abilities.  The show featured a discussion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," a segment where listeners flashed upon seeing a "wow" sticker, with a listener recounting her participation. The segment on Radcliffe's nude photos continued, including commentary on an overly enthusiastic news report and a listener's discussion of the play *Equus*.  Throughout this initial segment, the show maintained its characteristic crude humor, offensive language, and sexually suggestive comments.

The next segment heavily featured the Daniel Radcliffe nude photos, eliciting varied listener reactions.  Discussions around the play *Equus*, its nudity, and subsequent ticket demand followed, with recurring jokes about the "sexy shots" in both.  Listener calls reacted to news stories, including a humorous take on a Hell's Angels spokesperson's statement regarding a woman's assault ("We don't beat up broads").  A significant portion was dedicated to a comedic bit on "deaf karaoke," featuring audio clips and promotion of a CD, "Stone Cold Deaf," with proceeds benefiting deaf citizens.  The hosts even jokingly mentioned dentists being in the studio to numb listeners' mouths for a live attempt. Lewis Black then joined the show to promote his movie *Farce of the Penguins*, but the conversation quickly broadened to politics, the upcoming presidential election, news reporting, and Black's personal anecdotes, including stories about working with Robin Williams.  The discussion included commentary on various presidential candidates and their perceived weaknesses.  The segment concluded with further discussions of the Harry Potter photos and the state of the news media, along with more listener calls.

The following segment opened with a discussion of a Black man sentenced to death for killing two Black police officers.  The hosts speculated on the likelihood of an appeal, comparing the American judicial system to Iraq's, using darkly humorous analogies.  They then discussed New York's infrequent use of the death penalty since its reinstatement and speculated on former Governor Eliot Spitzer's likely actions regarding the death sentence. This transitioned into a discussion of payola and plugola, with humorous references to product endorsements.  Louis Black's previous appearances and movie were briefly mentioned. A caller, "Darren" ("Gunslinger"), representing the "Pests Out West" fan club, called in, leading to a discussion about rival fan groups.  The hosts then expressed their dislike of receiving sales pitches before the show, transitioning into a discussion on the changing landscape of commercial radio.  The latter half focused on Tyra Banks' reaction to unflattering swimsuit photos, with the hosts harshly criticizing her perceived hypocrisy regarding body positivity.  This included multiple sound bites from a Tyra Banks interview and listener calls. The segment concluded with inside jokes, recollections of past humorous bits like "The Harrington House" prank phone calls, behind-the-scenes anecdotes involving an intern and a porn actress, and a mention of Paris Hilton's offensive comments.

The penultimate segment detailed Anthony's tumultuous marriage, focusing on his wife's excessive drinking and disruptive behavior, including numerous anecdotes punctuated by crude jokes and sexually explicit descriptions. Callers, Keith and Peter from Massachusetts, offered their own perspectives on marriage and divorce.  The second half shifted to a severe rat infestation at XM Radio's Washington, D.C. headquarters, based on a leaked internal memo.  The hosts discussed the memo's contents,  speculated on the leaker, and discussed potential solutions.  Several callers shared rat-related anecdotes, including stories about rats in toilets and one caller, Jaime, mentioning killing a rat "about 35 inches" long.

The final segment began with the hosts discussing infrequent communication with someone named Kevin and exchanging explicit photos.  This led to a discussion about rats, fueled by a Seattle newspaper article, resulting in graphic and humorous descriptions of rats in toilets. Callers shared their own rat experiences, including electrocuting rats and a bizarre rat-catching method.  The "line of the day" segment, sponsored by Bodogfight.com, included jokes about Harry Potter. The segment concluded with a promise to continue rat stories the next day and a mention of a breast-baring promotion.

[00:01:30]  No, Fred.  Dancing talk.  Dancing talk for a floor.  All the radio riffs me off.  All the radio riffs me off.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  A negro.  Hello, exactly. 
[00:02:00]  I was only joking.  I can't get enough of those clips.  I was only joking.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How's everybody today?  Oh, a little sleepy.  You're a little sleepy?  A little groggy.  I feel so much better today than I did yesterday.  Although I'm still dealing with the gulpies.  I call it the gulpies.  Oh, where you have to swallow real hard because it feels like you got a marble in your throat. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, I didn't get much sleep last night because I was still gulping over and over and over again.  It's not the flu.  It's not a cold.  It's just called the gulpies.  Yeah, you had a touch of the something.  Yeah, the gulpies.  Now it's all just mucus.  You got to swallow mucus.  It just keeps swallowing all night long.  It feels like it goes down.  It feels like something like, oh, finally I swallowed it.  And then two seconds later, it's all still there in my throat.  No, it's not even that.  It's like a dry, sore throat. 
[00:03:00]  So you have to gulp to kind of lubricate.  And then you're like, okay, now I can fall asleep.  And that feeling of it going away lasts for, I don't know, 15 seconds.  And then you have to gulp again.  I call it the gulpies.  Also, I was sharing this morning, and I noticed that Jimmy had the same problem.  So something's going around.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I walked in today.  Sickness.  And Anthony hates this type of talk.  But I had to share with somebody.  I walk into the office, and I had to announce to everybody that I'd been farting for 18 straight hours. 
[00:03:30]  That's wonderful.  18 straight hours.  How often?  Once every?  Honestly, once every 30 seconds for 18 straight hours.  Sometimes more than one.  In the 30-second period.  The Guinness book.  I don't know what the hell is going on, man.  Something was producing gas.  My belly was way out to here. 
[00:04:00]  18 straight hours.  To the point I just gave up trying to hide it.  Really?  So, yeah.  So my lovely girlfriend there, Lindsay, had to deal with it.  Because I gave up.  I was leaving the room.  I was making believe I had to go do this and that.  There's only so many things you can do to leave the room.  Right.  I'm going to go check on the mail.  I'm going to get something out of the car.  I'm going to go read the meter.  I'm going to go to Starbucks.  I ran out of things.  And then it was just like, look, I can't hide this anymore. 
[00:04:30]  I'm in serious pain here.  You're going to have to deal with this.  Do you ever run into it?  I have another bathroom.  And I would run in there sometimes and put a towel over my ass and try to quiet it because  it's so embarrassing.  Yeah.  Here's a buffer.  A towel.  What?  Have you ever done it for 18 straight hours?  Of course.  I've had like maybe a couple hours, you know, whatever.  You've had your wings.  You go through a phase.  You've had your buffalo wings, grapes, and whole milk.  In a case of the vapors. 
[00:05:00]  But 18 straight hours.  And it finally ended at 3 this morning.  So you guys are set.  I was back yesterday too.  I dozed off and I came back.  And my girlfriend, I had been just nonstop under the covers.  And when I came back in, it was like an hour later.  And she's like, the whole apartment's just completely embarrassed.  You stunk up your entire place.  That's stupid.  I had the same deal.  And then there was about three or four hours yesterday.  I was by myself.  And this thing, it continued on and on.  To the point, even though I was by myself, I was completely embarrassed. 
[00:05:30]  Completely embarrassed for myself.  And there was no one around.  Like that Hunter in Dreamcatcher.  You ever seen the movie Dreamcatcher?  No, what?  Stephen King movie.  Read the book.  No one got the reference.  Somebody got the reference out there.  I did.  I did actually read that.  The guy that came in was farting.  The guy just comes into the cabin and he's just got the worst gas.  And they're kind of laughing.  But it turns out he's got something inside of him.  It's an alien or something.  Something evil.  Yeah.  Something awful.  How about this?  It was so bad last night. 
[00:06:00]  Woke myself up.  Wow.  Woke myself up.  Out of a sound sleep.  Sound sleep.  Going, what the hell is that?  Oh, it's me.  Oil refinery type.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Where it's just.  Exactly.  It actually conjures up the fragrance of an oil refinery.  It's like petroleum.  It's just pumping out.  Methane.  Pure methane.  I farted so bad my apartment was like exit 13A. 
[00:06:30]  Exactly.  Horrid.  So that's what I'm up to.  Still got the gulpies and 18 hours straight of farting.  But ready to broadcast this morning.  Anthony went home yesterday.  I was very excited.  I got my copy of Microsoft Vista.  Ooh.  And I was going to load it on up onto my computer.  I got a Dell XPS.  Things probably six months old, if that.  You know, all the top of the line quad graphics cards. 
[00:07:00]  And just, I got like four gigs of RAM in it.  The things, you know, it's really, I set it up for gaming.  So I figure I could take advantage of all that RAM by putting Vista on the machine.  It's the new operating system.  Why wouldn't you?  And people are warning me, don't do it.  Because they don't work the bugs out until like the first patches come out for it and everything.  And I'm like, all right, I can deal with that. 
[00:07:30]  Just let me, you know, install it.  Let me just help people along that are maybe new to the show.  You're way ahead of us as far as computers go.  I could dig around and I know my way around a computer.  I know what the parts do.  I know when there's conflicts.  I know how to fix them.  Give me enough time.  And I can take care of the problem.  You're pretty much educated as far as all this stuff goes.  I know what I'm doing.  You're not a newbie, okay?  You're not one of these guys that needs help just turn. 
[00:08:00]  No, no.  Absolutely not.  I just want to make that perfectly clear as you move on here.  Go ahead.  And it wouldn't even load.  I couldn't even.  Like people are telling me how awful it's going to be once it loads.  And how I'm going to have problems with it and it's buggy and things like that.  I couldn't even get it to load.  You know what I got it to do?  You know what Vista did for me?  It ate up half of my XP operating system to the point where my computer was rendered useless for hours on end. 
[00:08:30]  Hours on end.  It would give me nothing but it would start to load and then that blue fatal screen would come on.  That one that looks like it's from 1975.  Oh boy.  That screen with a big text that just says things and tells you how screwed you are.  That's what it did for me.  That's what it accomplished.  It was giving me all kinds of things where I was getting conflicts with hardware.  This is brand new hardware. 
[00:09:00]  I'm not trying to load it on an old machine or anything.  The drivers, of course, have to be updated to Vista drivers.  Some of the companies that have, like my graphics card company, has betas out for the graphics card, which means we just kind of whipped these up and threw them out there for you.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Hope it works.  So I was just sitting there trying not to throw everything onto the floor and just smash everything.  How many hours were you doing this for? 
[00:09:30]  I got home, all excited, my brand new little box with the hardware, the software in it and everything.  I'm ready to go.  And you're figuring maybe a half hour.  No, a new OS is going to take you a good hour, hour and a half to load up at least with a good system.  So you're thinking maybe two at the worst.  Yeah.  A couple hours, you'll get this up and running.  That's another thing to me.  And then you can go check it out.  I'm interested in the process.  So I don't care if it takes me a couple hours.  And I got the laptop next to me, which is good. 
[00:10:00]  You know, if you get any problems, you just go online with the other computer and you can kind of, you know, fix the computer with the computer.  Holy Jesus.  I went from when I got home at about, I guess, noon.  I was home at noon and started immediately.  Uh, 1030 last night.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  I was just starting to think about going to bed because I assumed I had gotten my computer back into working order with XP back reloaded onto it. 
[00:10:30]  Until three this morning, I heard boom, boom, boom, like things popping up on my computer as it was trying to upgrade automatically.  Just missing parts and, and, and, and, and drivers and files.  It's just a catastrophe.  Did you picture punching the screen at all?  Oh, I wanted to so bad.  The, the worst part was as it's loading, it wasn't at the beginning of the load. 
[00:11:00]  It was toward the end.  So I'd have to wait an hour for this system to, to load for it to tell me, nope, nope.  And then I get a big screen with a bunch of the conflicts and then I'm trying to, uh, fix the conflicts by going to the various, um, vendor sites of my cards, downloading the most recent drivers.  I downloaded the, the new bios for my computer, which, you know, you got to keep up to date.  And, and it's telling me there's conflict with that. 
[00:11:30]  It's just conflict, conflict, conflict, conflict.  So I decided on a lark for a goof because I knew what this was going to happen.  I wish you'd taped this by the way.  I did in the middle of the call.  I really wish you'd taped it.  I didn't even get angry, but I had wished I taped it.  I called Microsoft customer service and I got,  Hello, this is customer service.  My name is Elaine. 
[00:12:00]  No, your name's not Elaine.  Let's stop with the dishonesty right now.  I know you're in India.  Your name is Ahanbalama.  And, uh, you're not going to be able to help me one bit.  She did.  Here's, here's how it started.  Okay.  Uh, what happened?  Well, I, I bought Vista and I want to install it.  I have XP.  It's, uh, my system.  I told him the system I have and everything.  And, uh, I'm getting a blue screen error, uh, right at the end of the, uh, load sequence for this. 
[00:12:30]  Um, I trying to upgrade the drivers.  I've, I've done all that and still this will not load.  And here's what she goes.  She, the first thing she goes, okay, uh, Mr. Go, how do you spell your name?  And I, I spelled my last name and she couldn't get it right five times in a row.  C-O-M, no, C-U-M as in Michael I-A.  C-U-N, they cannot friggin' hear letters. 
[00:13:00]  So finally that got sorted out and she goes, okay, Mr. Comia, we were, are you connected to the internet?  And I'm like, I, I, I go, wait, wait.  I said right there, hold on, hold on.  I go, excuse me, ma'am.  We are light years past that point right here.  Light years.  Don't go through the flow chart.  I don't want to hear.  Is your PC plugged in? 
[00:13:30]  Did you hit the on switch?  Is there a disc in the, let's bypass all that.  Go to step 6,033, because that's where we are on your flow chart.  And, uh, she could not help.  She kept asking me the same thing.  She goes, so what do, and she's all nervous.  She goes, what do, um, you tried the Vista on the XP and it wouldn't, uh, install.  Yes.  I, I, I, I explained it again.  And she goes, okay, hold on. 
[00:14:00]  Puts me on hold.  Comes back and goes, and goes, so now the XP you have and you tried the Vista, but this is not loading for you.  And I said, look, we, and this continued a couple of times.  I said, you've asked me the same thing five times.  I go, look, I bought Vista.  It will not load on my XP system.  I get a blue screen error.  Can we move past that part and, and get to something that will fix this problem? 
[00:14:30]  It was useless.  Yeah.  When did you realize that she couldn't help you?  The second she said hello.  I swear to you, I'm not even joking.  But this is the beauty of all of us.  You knew this person could not help you whatsoever.  Not in the least.  But you, you had to stay on the line.  Had to play it out.  Had to play it out.  I wanted to see how much she didn't know about what she was supposed to know about.  So they, finally, after a while, she goes, I would hand you off to a technician. 
[00:15:00]  I'm like, okay, I'm going to get, you know, a guy named Brad in the frigging Silicon Valley somewhere.  And he's going to tell me, dude, don't be stupid.  You do this, this, that, that, everything works.  Hello.  My name is Bob.  I get another Indian guy that is more concerned with giving me my case number and making a file for me than fixing anything.  Because he doesn't know anything either.  So he's just like, you know, what step are you at now?  I go, I'm on the step of calling you. 
[00:15:30]  Like trying to get some type of assistance.  Because I've done everything that is supposed to be done.  Updated everything.  All the drivers.  All the updates that Windows supplies.  Everything was updated.  And then I'm getting message board things telling me I got to un-update.  Just rip all your drivers out.  And then load it up raw.  A full clean install.  So I tried that.  Instead of the update.  Because those never work.  So I tried a clean install.  And what it did was cleaned out half of my XP where that couldn't load and Vista couldn't load. 
[00:16:00]  So I'm sitting there with a computer that just can't load.  So now I'm taking the old XP disk out.  Popping it back in.  Reloading that.  And I had backed up all my files that I needed.  So I didn't care.  It was just a big waste of time.  So what are you going to do with Vista?  Throw it out the window?  People have asked me online.  They want to see what is called the dump file that you get when your computer crashes like that. 
[00:16:30]  You see it's dumping physical memory.  And it says they want to see the dump file.  They're going to get a dump file.  It's going to be me having dumped on the Vista disk.  And I will upload the picture.  So what's the solution with this Vista?  Get a brand new computer with it already on it.  With it already installed.  Yeah.  That seems to be the only way these things really work.  Or you can really kind of strip your computer down and load it on and hope for the best that there's drivers available for the real expensive good hardware that I have on my computer. 
[00:17:00]  I got like top of the line graphics cards that, you know, for some reason, they really don't have the drivers for it for Vista.  Here's the answer.  Mac.  Oh, yeah.  I will never deal with that again.  Well, the computer I had next to me was my MacBook.  So I was posting on the message board, going back and forth with people that have a string, how do you like Vista, things like that. 
[00:17:30]  And I go, well, let me tell you how much I like it.  I'm posting this from my MacBook right now because I'm looking at a blue screen of death sitting in front of me on my Windows monitor.  That's beautiful.  Oh, it was just a catastrophe, catastrophic failure of that computer.  And at 3 in the morning, I heard that bong bong.  So it's still screwed up.  It's still screwed up.  Let's go to Paul listening to us on WYSP. 
[00:18:00]  We appreciate that you're supporting the local stations there.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I would rather be in an Opie's shoes.  Oh, boy.  You deliver jokes like Vista loads.  Exactly.  He wanted to say I'd rather fart for 18 hours and load Vista.  I'd have had better luck trying to load it on my MacBook.  There you go.  That's stupid.  The way you felt, as frustrated as you feel at an advanced point. 
[00:18:30]  Like Anthony can go out and load drivers.  That's how I would feel just putting something simple on it, and that's what would happen.  And you get like so livid.  Yeah.  And hours are going by.  Hours.  And I'm just trying to get this to load, and I keep getting that blue screen.  It's amazing what kind of patience you have.  He is.  It really is.  I'll sit there and just pick the problem apart, and usually, well, up until now, I've been  able to solve any computer problem I've had.  Yeah.  Sometimes it takes hours, but I just pick it apart one thing at a time. 
[00:19:00]  I was just trying to eliminate one conflict, hardware conflict, driver conflict at a time,  and it just would not work.  And it was – you would think with Vista out and all this big thing that drivers would  just be available.  These drivers are the things that make the operating system recognize the hardware.  It's called a driver.  And if the OS doesn't recognize the hardware, you might as well just have a block of lead 
[00:19:30]  in the computer because it ain't going to do anything.  It was infuriating.  When I saw – we have a prep sheet, and I came in, and you look at your prep sheet, and  it's a story.  Anthony can't install Windows Vista.  Oh, I know.  I just giggled.  You were joyful.  You were giddy.  Anthony, you must have been so hot under the collar.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I will not be going the way of Vista anytime soon.  I think maybe if I buy a new computer in the next year, I'll have it. 
[00:20:00]  Put it this way.  With the way my memory is, my short-term memory is garbage for phone numbers and things like  that.  I got to the point where I memorized the key number to the Windows.  And you know it's like 18 frigging numbers of four blocks of – it got to that point where  I had put it in so many times.  Wow.  Like, oh, yes, this old number.  All right.  Infuriating. 
[00:20:30]  That was Anthony's night.  We got lots to do on the show today.  We're going to take a quick break, get into it.  You know what?  We'll just – we'll make it a surprise after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker, get flashed, get happy.  Details on opianthony.com.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

[00:21:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Burr here in New York.  Yeah, for the newer listeners, we'll explain Whip-Em-Out Wednesday a little later on.  Yeah.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  I got a question today.  A simple question.  Oh, good.  And it's going to lead to some audience participation.  I don't like the tough questions. 
[00:21:30]  We haven't given a homework assignment in a while.  Yep.  But we need some audience participation.  The question is simple.  Why do I have to see Harry Potter nude today?  I've been keeping track.  Oh, well, now it's up to 9, 10, 11 times.  11 times I've seen Harry Potter nude.  I've only been up maybe two hours at this point.  I've already seen Harry Potter nude, shirtless, topless. 
[00:22:00]  I'm up to 11, 12 times already.  I'll tell you, he's a brave man.  That's a brave guy who'll pose nude in front of a horse.  Yep.  You know?  He's in, what, Equus?  Is that what he's doing?  Some play, right?  Some play.  It's Equus.  Whatever.  It's famous, you know.  Is it?  Yeah, a lot of these English guys do it.  Oh, it's famous?  What is the play about?  Uh, horse.  All right.  Do the horse's name Equus?  It's like a horse and a naked child star. 
[00:22:30]  But, uh, came into work.  I opened up the Daily News, our fine paper here in New York.  First page, boom, Harry Potter nude.  I go to the post a few pages in.  Boom, Harry Potter nude.  Yep.  Newsday out there on Long Island.  Harry Potter nude.  USA Today, Harry Potter nude.  We come into the, into our studio, we turn on all the TVs, boom, Harry Potter nude.  Yep.  Nude everywhere. 
[00:23:00]  Now, uh, you're, you're.  You can't avoid it.  You're not taking lemons and making lemonade, though.  No, I'm not.  Because I see these nude pictures of Harry Potter.  Yeah.  And, uh, I think something completely different.  What are you saying?  Well, I see a, um, mature, uh, male body here.  Don't you?  It's, there's hair.  There's, uh, muscles.  It's a mature male body.  Correct?  Follow me on this.  Follow me.  You're scaring us.  I know, but it's just the first part of it. 
[00:23:30]  And why would he shave his chest but not, like, around his belly button?  I don't know if he's shaving anything.  Here's the part.  That's a shaved chest.  Would you let me get to the part so I don't sound like a homo?  No, let's keep it right there.  No.  Let's keep, all right, moving on to other things today.  No.  If he looks like this.  Yeah.  What does Hermione look like?  Oh, wow.  Without her clothes on.  All right, now you're getting into something.  Now, now see, I bet, I bet she is looking extremely hot. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  And where the hell are her nude pictures?  If anyone from Harry Potter had to be naked, why can't it be her?  You know what?  Speaking of which, that SNL skit where they show these, that the kid's growing up and  still doing the Harry Potter movies.  That was Lindsay Lohan was hosting that one.  Oh, wow.  Was that hilarious?  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Where she's all butted out already.  They came back for the second movie, I think, or the third one, whatever it was.  She's got just huge cans.  And the guys are completely distracted by them because they're still, like, youngsters. 
[00:24:30]  By the way, the boys are keeping track for us.  In the Daily News alone, he's nude twice.  Twice in the Daily News alone.  Right.  On TV, Good Morning America, I just saw three or four pictures.  It was a montage of nude pictures.  This is a whole thing where they do this.  Thank you.  They do this because it's, like, taboo.  It's because you think of Harry Potter as being the young Harry Potter boy.  And him being nude is this, like, taboo, trying to titillate thing. 
[00:25:00]  And the news runs with it as they, you know, have other stories about horrific pedophiles  and what they're doing.  They kind of do this and throw a fuel on the fire.  My question is, why did he wait so long?  Absolutely.  Ten years too late, if you ask me.  What's with all that body hair?  What a buzzkill.  Body hair.  I have to just turn the pile over here because I'm looking for the back. 
[00:25:30]  It's just a white piece of paper, darn it.  All right, let's go to New Orleans and say hi to Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  What's up?  No homo this morning.  No homo, please.  Yeah, no homo.  Of course.  Yeah.  See, for the new listeners, you can talk about gay stuff on our show as long as you say  no homo.  No homo.  Then it's okay.  No, it's just that you can't get away from it.  He's posted everywhere this morning.  How many times did I yell again?  It's like eight times.  I go to the bathroom and I'm just trying to do my thing. 
[00:26:00]  Another picture of him nude.  Thank God.  I'm trying to see.  Harry Potter everywhere.  I saw the papers this morning.  I thought someone from the media photographed my subconscious.  Darren in New Hampshire, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Glad to see you back on local.  Oh, right on.  What's up, Darren?  BCN.  Hey, the Harry Potter thing.  I watched it with my daughter.  That's disgusting.  Ah.  Well.  Brings back the old underdog thing.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, you went old school on it.  Wow, real old.  All right.  Thank you, Harry. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, someone's asking new title of pictures.  What does that mean?  Mike in Cleveland.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Good to hear you again.  Yeah, right on.  What's the title of this new piece going to be?  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stones?  Or, uh, what do you guys think?  Oh, oh.  Sorcerer's Stones.  Stones.  Well, yeah.  Well, I guess we could come up with some Harry Potter movies today.  But I'm sure some morning zoo somewhere is doing that bit.  So we might have to stay away from that one.  Yeah.  What we want, though, audience participation today.  I'm telling you, you're just waking up. 
[00:27:00]  You're getting yourself together.  I want you to call our show when you see Harry Potter nude for the first time today.  You're going to see it all day long.  I am.  And you're going to be thinking about us all day long.  Because this picture is going to be everywhere today.  On the news?  It's going to be on your local news.  It's going to be in your papers.  Yep.  It's going to be everywhere.  It's probably on billboards all over your city.  Who knows?  But that's the audience participation today.  The moment you see Harry Potter nude, you call the show with your disgust.  All right? 
[00:27:30]  By the way, moving on.  We knew it would happen.  What?  Finally, the police are reuniting.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Finally, the police are reuniting.  Couldn't you tell something was going on when we had...  We met the whole band in a week's time.  Yep.  Jimmy and I went and saw Sting in his stupid lute in front of...  We were lucky enough to be, what, one...  There was about 200 people there. 
[00:28:00]  We were invited to watch him in his dumb lute.  Lucky.  Well, yeah, I guess.  And we were hating it the whole time, as everyone else is politely...  Bravo, bravo.  Wonderful lute performance.  And then we had Andy Summers come in, and then we had Stuart Copeland all within, you're  right, a week's time.  Yeah.  We all knew something was up.  And they were like, because everybody was bringing up, you know, hey, is there going  to be a police reunion?  And they were just like, well, you know, if the guys want to kind of, well, we haven't 
[00:28:30]  really...  They really kind of beat around the bush there, and yeah, now they're...  Have they announced it officially?  Yes.  Yeah.  They will be reuniting at the Grammys.  How cool is that?  At the Grammys?  Do you think they knew at the time, or that they...  Absolutely.  Really?  Really?  I think they did.  They were just...  Things looting just kind of pushed them into doing it.  Well, I think it took Sting and his lute to be humbled to finally get this together,  because his ego was so out of control when he just left the band way back in the day.  I think it was maybe a different kind of lute that he had in mind. 
[00:29:00]  So no more of this.  Armageddon, sweet love that from now invite, thy graces let me...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba 
[00:29:30]  audience just sit there and go well we've uh we have a new direction you think it's gonna be an  all-out police reunion i think uh you're not gonna see the loot it's about effing time this is the  one band i've been waiting uh to reunite yeah probably the only band i've been waiting uh to 
[00:30:00]  reunite i can't think of another band that i i want to see that uh retired because most of them  never retired no they're dead dead they're either dead or playing some kind of uh casino boat  somewhere yeah a lot of them uh did go on to casino it's odd when you drive through atlantic city or  you're in vegas and you see like lover boy is like oh what the hell are they doing the crickets i want  them to reunite they haven't been the same since buddy went down the crickets with one less cricket 
[00:30:30]  yeah uh but i you know what i saw the police back in the day at the syracuse uh dome there man  we're on in syracuse yeah we took a bus ride from uh geneseo had no money had just enough money for  the the tickets and the bus ride no money for beer or no money for food got to syracuse saw the concert  got scared out of our our our our wits or whatever you want to say because his band black who who who  who black who opened up for the police one of these like rebel black reggae bands like scary black 
[00:31:00]  kill whitey kill whitey type music one of the whitest bands get up there after them yeah  yeah uh black who who uh had probably 50 people on stage all playing something of course everything  from drums to guitars to sticks to tambourines how did the uh windmills to to pots and pans  how did the uh police audience uh like them yeah they were filing in yeah are they we got there early 
[00:31:30]  because you know we had nowhere else to go so we're sitting in our seats watching this uh display  on the stage and then we uh got to see the police and then uh hung out at a fraternity house all night  long got completely hammered and then went back to the uh bus station and it was too early to take a bus  back to geneseo so we slept right on the curb waiting for the bus that's uh what you did back then  of course an ordinary like night out at a concert yeah we used to do the nassau coliseum thing all the 
[00:32:00]  time and it was uh one of those you know it was a big event when you went to a show back then getting  the tickets you're in school who's going who's making the run who's making the run the who was  having their uh final concert when i was in high school yeah what happened there 18 final concerts  later i remember one year my mother gave me her credit card and i came into new york from new jersey  to see ozzy this is probably 1984 and um puffy haired ozzy yeah that was the bet midler ozzy  yeah that was like the sequined down uh yeah and i had her credit card and i was online and uh 
[00:32:30]  it had expired her credit card oh no i wanted to kill her and then myself so i got home and just  told her how she let me down she felt really bad i did get to go too by the way oh you did of course  got tickets yeah hey let's go to tommy in staten ireland tommy what's up love to see your little  face yeah yeah and i saw the police back in 1980 81 and it was a band called the tom robinson band 
[00:33:00]  and the hit song was if you're gay and you know it clap your hands get the hell out of here i swear  to god you can look it up eroc find that song did they have a big uh a lot of people clapping  we're doing something that sounded like clapping not really why is this band getting a standing  ovation not so much clapping going on yeah all right we're gonna we're gonna try to find that  song there tommy i don't know that song tom robinson band all right thank you sir all right punch it out 
[00:33:30]  yes rage against machine is uh getting back together for a few shows and then we got eric in south  dakota are they the entire band yeah yeah yeah wow that's kind of interesting they hated each other  because they're doing uh just fine with uh with the new lineup still rage in my eyes even though  chris cornell chris cornell uh that'd be good get uh soundgarden back together there that there you  go eric what's up sound like rage i heard a rumor that zeppelin's getting back together everyone except  for their drummer well yeah the weird thing is why didn't zeppelin ever get back together uh 
[00:34:00]  uh uh robert plant really can't cut those zeppelin vocals anymore yeah well now but i mean they they  stopped what uh performing in the early 80s yeah they were one of those bands that decided you know  if they lose a band member that's it right it was over so they uh didn't get back together but they  could have easily thrown you know johnson in there when you when they see any of these bands that were  around way back when when they see that again here it is the number one selling uh grossing a band of 
[00:34:30]  year is the rolling stones they see that and go what are we doing we're missing out on some huge  cash rolling stones pulled in 150 million dollars last year yeah the number one um musical act that  and and the the endorsements that they had during that whole uh when they when they're touring all  you see is commercials with their music them in the background on stage remember that i guess it was  for a credit card or some crap i don't even know but man they just whore themselves out now yeah 
[00:35:00]  making boatloads of cash and these other bands are like what are we doing oh we're sitting on our  ass playing a loot by the way the biggest disappointment in the coming year yeah uh van  halen reuniting with david lee roth david lee roth everybody excited but they have no idea that david  lee roth can't pull it off anymore look i i'm saying it right now too i loved van halen growing up but  it's gonna be a disaster if he can't pull this off it's gonna be me and opi will not step in to sing 
[00:35:30]  for van halen we've had it  fixing his crap i know a lot of people looking forward to the van halen reunion but i'm telling  you it is gonna be laughable how awful it is dave can't sing uh dave never really was able to sing  he kind of talks his way through songs we had talked about this before he had the look and all  but yeah now he looks like he should be doing like cabaret or something but he had the look the  whole band had the look uh you know the guitar playing was cutting edge that's what it was the 
[00:36:00]  time that kind of made them huge too and and david lee roth had all the moves and everything he was  the consummate lead rock singer guy aside from steven carr from uh foundry uh love pendulum yeah  great song dude uh but you know that that time is kind of gone and what's david lee roth gonna do like  get out there and do those big high karate kicks off the top of the friggin marshals  he's gonna break a hip he's not gonna be able to do any of that no and then i i noticed also when 
[00:36:30]  uh sammy hagar took over for van halen and hagar whether you love him or hate him uh the guy's got  a huge voice huge range the guy could hit notes that are amazing and i heard david lee roth singing  some van halen songs after that whole thing and he was trying to sound like sammy he was actually  trying to hit some of those notes and it was horrid he was screaming and and warbling it was  awful so i can't see that really sounding good no i think there's gonna be uh a lot of disappointment 
[00:37:00]  didn't eddie have his tongue cut out because of cancer or something i don't know and what's his  name backup and and uh eddie's using his son yeah i guess his son wolf wolfgang is playing drums  a bass player yeah oh really i thought it was uh no wolfgang's 15 he's gonna be playing bass for uh  because michael anthony's not banned anymore why michael anthony said uh because they wanted to pay  him a little salary no michael anthony became really uh friendly with uh sammy yeah they're 
[00:37:30]  really close those two oh okay sammy and michael anthony got chummy went out on the road with  sammy's band eddie got they got what chummy chummy oh can i just say a sentence you can he  sounds like a gossip television show they got chummy they were caught canoodling all right so  what happened so uh uh michael anthony went out on the road with um with uh sammy's band a few times  and i guess eddie got a little bit aggravated that they were doing van halen songs so he said you're  out of the band and so is sammy and my son wolfgang's gonna step in eddie is such a douche 
[00:38:00]  what a baby this guy is it's amazing he's such a baby you really want to see the entire band i  guess if you're excited about a van reunions yeah just make up with michael anthony and get it done  i'll tell you one thing um nothing better than those michael anthony uh bass solos  that was the time you went and got beer yeah they would all they would all do like a solo 
[00:38:30]  like like it would start with eddie it would start eddie of course his wonderful guitar solo  or was he last maybe he would last yeah i think it would start actually with uh dave like dave  some kind of boozy boozy i believe it i believe that bitch yeah crap and then uh uh what's what's  his name for alan alex would would uh do a huge drum solo that would take forever  nothing worse than the drum solo except for the bass solo it was hard it just reminded me of a 
[00:39:00]  Spinal Tap when they were Mach 2.  It's on New Direction.  I hope you enjoy it.  There's nothing that sounds worse than a bass guitar alone.  Yeah, with a lot of echo and just it's all, it's stunk.  People keep cheering.  Like every time there's a stop, they cheer.  It's like, oh, it's over.  Yeah, yeah, it's over. 
[00:39:30]  And then the drum solo would have to get down to the point where he's just playing that tiny cymbal.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Yeah, yeah.  Ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  All right, we get it.  You can play the drums.  That's why you're in Van Halen.  You don't have to showcase yourself, jackass.  And then finally, you would get the Eddie Van Halen solo, which was.  Yeah, now that was something to say.  Definitely.  Very unique, especially back then. 
[00:40:00]  Of admission.  But, you know, the rest of the guys are like, hey, man, what about me?  I want to do a little solo.  But then, yeah, you got the.  you can't really like there's not you know when you do a guitar solo or when eddie would you'd  hear very distinct notes and everything you know well the bass is just this big sloppy bottom end  mess well unless you're a bass player that plays one of those six string basses and can play with  both hands yeah you're not really doing much except loading up on effects and you know hitting  one note yeah reverberate in an arena making you vomit from the sonic vibrations what would 
[00:40:30]  foundry have done yeah what would foundry have done back then dress up in lane bryant clothes  and embarrass our mothers jesus lane hey uh this is fascinating talk but we got jane on the line  here jane what's going on today hey good morning guys good morning jane i just wanted to say happy  whip them out wednesday thank you i am always on the garden state whipping them out so even in the  winter even in the winter you're you're giving a little show on the garden state parkway i am a

[00:50:00]  there they've ridiculed uh free overnight host john and jeff for being too nice uh when whoopi  goldberg came to ktu last summer ona called her boring beyond belief then she came to visit they had  a pleasant on-air chat and the lampooning stopped now every so often they say they regret that true  since they clearly still find her show dull last week ona teed off on man cow the one-time shock  jock trying to reinvent himself as a political commentator recalling how man cow once blocked 
[00:50:30]  traffic on san francisco's bay bridge for a stunt ona suggested reasonably he should maybe shut up  he should maybe shut up so it just shows that we're just going after someone pretty much every  day with this radio show we are asses we really are we know accept it it's just what we do uh let's  go to boston and say hi to dan dan what's up what's up boys hey i'm gonna call him dan the man dan the  man i bet that never happens go ahead there dan to work uh stop at dunga donuts front page of the

[00:51:30]  you doing hi by the way that guy's lying i'm looking at the front page of the herald i don't see no uh  harry potter nude what oh that was yesterday's okay uh what's up mark  it was a movie from the late 70s star george c scott and it was famous for the first male frontal  nudity shown in a major motion picture and the plot line is a boy who has a religious  torment and in his bedroom where he sleeps there was a picture of jesus and something happens with 
[00:52:00]  the family i can't remember exactly what it is but something important he places a picture of a  horse head that picture of a friendly picture of a horse over the picture of jesus and it screws  with his psyche and it gets to be uh a sexual relationship not between the the horse and the  boy but in a self-gratifying kind of way right and then in the end towards the end uh becky what's going 
[00:52:30]  on thanks hey hey becky that doll you're looking for some information about equus yes um it's i mean  it was originally a play it may have been turned into a movie in the 70s but it's originally a play  and it is about a insane boy mentally disturbed boy who does become a naturally fixated on a horse  but there's no sex with the horse and he ends up he ends up actually impaling the horse's eye

[01:06:00]  you're checking out the opian anthony show lots of new today still we got an update on the hell's  angels uh story yeah they just had a spokesman on uh on the news holy crap wow yeah that press  conference looked a little frightening who would ever mess with these guys they look exactly like  you think bikers should look they're just big dude they looked rougher than i pictured i pictured you  know hell's angels tough biker guy but the guys they just showed on the news unbelievably like tough you 
[01:06:30]  you know what it is because in movies in movies you see guys that play bikers but they're like  corny movie bikers that have like yeah they're not they're not hardcore bikers then when you see  like the real ones like oh yeah these guys are a problem they try to make them rough and tumble but  they're like actors i'm active yeah you think these guys ever had to go to go see a chick flick  no no no never dragged to a chick flick no uh well well what's the story here in new york for the 
[01:07:00]  for the rest of the country well it's pretty interesting some broad was having her birthday  and uh her 50 what second birthday 52 years young 52 years young she uh maybe was a little intoxicated  uh and um had an altercation with a couple of bikers biker guy and his uh chick right and followed  him down the street uh kind of harassing them and yelling at them and um this is what the paper  reported yesterday by the way and uh they went into the hell's angels club that's located downtown 
[01:07:30]  so this woman apparently didn't stop and kept yelling things and uh one of the bikers yelled  out the window hey shut up and she said why don't you be a man and come down and say it to my face  like a man and somebody came down and apparently punched her into a coma and just beat her silly  and uh now they're uh the police responded it was uh what they're saying is unnecessary force and but 
[01:08:00]  uh yeah i guess they were having a press conference today about what what are they saying that the well  on page five of the daily news the headline reads we don't hit broads is that hell's angel  these guys are just a real deal that's hysterical guys are amazing when you're trying to like say you  know hey we didn't beat this woman uh some there's a misunderstanding and miscommunication she was  found in in front of the building it doesn't mean that we did anything we don't beat broads well 
[01:08:30]  the article starts off by saying the head of the hell's angels manhattan chapter has a simple  explanation why his members had nothing to do with the beating of a drunk woman and here's the quote we  don't beat up broads yeah i love these yeah these aren't the guys that hang out with rocky dennis's  mom yeah these are you know those bikers i love these guys so that's the latest they're trying to  figure it out they had uh security cameras wouldn't it be obvious who beat up this woman yeah i'm sure 
[01:09:00]  they'll they're they're looking at those i think it's obvious who beat up this woman uh it's not obvious  to me it might be obvious to anthony cumia i didn't say a word who lives on long island and  if you need his address but look man i'll turn my obvious no i meant some person of uh ethnic uh uh  background that is uh probably uh does these things we're bad boys no doubt about that but  we don't bully people and we don't hit women said a member bart dowling um isn't that everything that 
[01:09:30]  covers a bad boy if you're not beating people and women bully people we don't bully that means  we don't pick on weaker people oh and they don't pick the fights yeah they probably just like you  know the the people they fight probably are the bikers and when one biker is pretty much smashing  another biker you can't say it's bullying there was a uh all in that kind of the fraternity you know  yeah there was there was a uh a motorcycle a gang i don't know if they're still around on long  island of course remember the remember the pagans they're still around are they yeah of 
[01:10:00]  course constantly at battle with uh hell's angels and you'd always hear about it they used to hang  out at a bar i used to uh frequent and uh they'd come in and you know one day one of them just be  beat senseless and talk about this huge fight they had with hell's the hell's angels and what a  lifestyle jesus christ you just you're just beating people up that's what you do my girlfriend told me  a story last night because we were talking about the story where her and her two friends her and 
[01:10:30]  her indian girlfriend and her uh black uh male uh pal were walking by the hell's angels uh  headquarters on third street and they were kicking something in front of them three  they think you walk down the street just kicking something she said it was like i don't know what  it was a piece of garbage remember the can i don't know and she said there were some bikers  out front and when they they kicked it ahead a little bit and then one of the bikers took what they  were kicking and just kicked it across the street and looked at the three of them  which is like come on it's a guy with two chicks and there's eight bikers why would you do that 
[01:11:00]  that's hilarious did he go hey now i like that was mine she said we all just looked at them and said  nothing of course what else are you gonna do of course what if it was some soccer mom that kicked  that can away from you oh you'd be right in her face bitch oh yeah you would tell what's up  hey uh we got more anchors talking about the nude harry potter great you want to go to this audio  here of course no one could get away from it today yeah it's it's everywhere they're all talking about 
[01:11:30]  it and uh we find it very funny how the anchors have to report this uh story today they're all  handling it a bit different clearly contesta harry potter has left his invisibility cloaked  behind at hogwarts this is what we're seeing in the paper  his invisibility cloak oh we can see him clearly clearly they have to add a little harry potter joke  who wrote that line for him you think or was it his uh it wasn't his do they have comedy writers 
[01:12:00]  you think on the news obviously not yeah clearly clearly clearly contesta harry potter has left his  invisibility cloaked behind at hogwarts this is what we're seeing in the daily express  now what would have been funny is if he said harry is nude and now you can see hogwarts hogwarts  see it's all in the wording there's the there's the line 
[01:12:30]  ross bravo jimmy this is what we're seeing in the papers today the daily express  showing him that he's gonna put a star in a play called equus uh not a new one it's a uh a redo  if you will about a young boy who has a an erotic attraction to horses not very uh exciting perhaps  he's also on the front page here he's making news in england primarily because he is an english actor  seventeen years old but a lot of this is publicity hype for the play which opens at the end of february 
[01:13:00]  could you just in the interest of good journalism hold the newspaper back up again because you know quite  honestly it was so fast that i didn't really get a good oh oh oh could you quite possibly in the  interest of uh good journalism just um pull the plug on this station because how does she put good  journalism in the same sentence with please hold up that 17 year old nude boy picture just to offer me  a awful joke she's trying to be yeah she's trying to gal okay yeah but i didn't really get a good look 
[01:13:30]  at it look into if you put back up the jambonet graphic i'm what look for a new what where yeah he  fires out some disgusting just a horrible taste of lime  i think what you'd want is what the horse has wait what are you talking about commercial 
[01:14:00]  wow that's really funny good look at it look you were paying attention to this now look  oh and here we'll do this harry harry there he is harry potter daniel radcliffe uh this is a  publicity shot for the plague which opens in about two weeks oh well you know what i didn't even  notice which shows you how uh what an investigator which shows you how straight i am no homo back to  you i want to make it perfectly clear i didn't notice a thing completely heterosexual now here's todd with 
[01:14:30]  sports which opens in about two weeks well you know what i didn't even notice which shows you  how uh what an investigative journalist i am all right we'll give him a pass yeah he's not saying  these sexy shots these sexy shots we're we're studying these reports today to see how you report  this first guy i don't know something's going on this guy he says but this guy's also not a good 
[01:15:00]  improver though if you hear how awful his improv was she had a funny line not so harry right and uh  i'm not a good reporter i'm not i'm not ed norton yeah way to think on your feet uh let's go to  norton in cleveland huh norton norton what's up oh hey hey hey got a half uh half page uh  ad here with uh harry potter in it half page whatever it says uh see jim norton at houston  improv good again yeah that doesn't really help the harry potter yeah i appreciate that but all 
[01:15:30]  right i'm not gonna yell at you for it obviously we got uh one more bit of audio oh the news is so  excited about this talking about the harry potter nude well these shots listen to this one this is my  favorite and then the protagonist of the harry potter has given a change radical to his image and what  change because now he is completely naked in a theater that is released in london the young actor 
[01:16:00]  who has 17 years already has 17 years appears in these promotional images of the famous famous  work echoes in which he has the role of a peon who feels a sexual fascination by a horse  for one caballo la portavoz del actor aseguró que su intención no es alejarse de harry potter  sino demostrar que es un actor capaz de realizar diferentes papeles  it takes a spanish news person to do it uh just straight ahead by the way our ratings just shot  through the roof here in new york hey there you go wow hola there's a really cool scene apparently

[01:31:00]  placed them pretty much one after another you were uh yeah i was i was in a hotel and i'm there's lewis  and uh robin williams is the president and then you're in that movie and then you get reviews and then it's  like you're a big star and then you get reviews where like yeah you know lewis black fake laughing  at robin williams oh boy you know it's like well of course you got a fake laugh at the guy you know  at least you're honest about it like it's unbelievable you heard it here lewis black fake  laughs oh yeah you're right no that's at robin williams you know what i'll tell you is that was 
[01:31:30]  he was he was actually fun to work with yeah to be honest i mean he's like a nice guy he's like  well he it's the whole movies on his back we're shooting in like 35 days and he's working and then  he's going i mean if you're going to say that i did something say you know i'm the one who sent him to  rehab we could go there oh okay but you can't say that i'd fake laugh were you the one that sent him  to rehab no i was there though when he was making the transition going we would sit around okay and he 
[01:32:00]  would have we'd finish up a shoot i would have uh you know a martini three glasses of wine consider  having another two he'd come down and have one shot of tequila and leave and and he would say you know  i think um i think i really gotta go into into rehab and and he's doing a shot maybe i saw him do two  shots of tequila and a beer in six weeks at which time i consumed whatever was around you know uh you know 
[01:32:30]  antifreeze and he's going i'm going to rehab i said if you're going to rehab i have to live there  i said how can you be going then i've got it if you consider that you have a problem then i really  have a problem well because he was clean and sober for many many years yeah man yeah i was talking about  the cello and i just talk about being sober and all this a little while ago having coffee was he doing  other stuff do you think i mean was there like an energy uh helper i don't think so i really don't  you mean red bull right yeah yeah that's it no i read but i actually don't think that  turn through your nose you know i don't think that was it i think it was alcohol because uh at 
[01:33:00]  least but i didn't see him when uh you know because he wasn't doing that i mean he really  literally he couldn't have done it and kept it together because he was good in in what he was  doing yeah it was not like you know you didn't he didn't like leave every five minutes and go to  the trailer he hung out with us for like 14 hours a day did he how long did that movie take it took 35  days that was it yeah it was crazy so fast i don't know like it took three days well they  wanted it done what and fast yeah that's just messing with them did you just oh i don't even hear you 
[01:33:30]  are you still doing the daily show yeah i'm on a cable like once every three weeks or something  like they put it in that rotation i mean i don't know they said it used to be i'd do it when i was in  town and then they came up with the concept that i would do it once every three weeks well once every  three weeks i'm not here a lot of those once every three weeks so and they don't put one in the can  so they can play that or they don't have me do it two weeks and then i'm gone three weeks you know 
[01:34:00]  they don't do it that way so they come up with a too busy doing movies movies what other movies  have you been i would start done yeah movies that career's over did you catch it that you don't  movies where am i did they call did i do another movie i haven't done a movie in seven months so  that one's done everybody go you're that was the thing you know you go to you know los angeles you  go you know this means you're a movie you're gonna be a movie star i'm going we've done one and a  half movies you idiots oh no this is it and then you do and i kept going you know that's it we'll 
[01:34:30]  finish up the movies and that'll be that part of my career and we'll go on to something lewis heard he  was going to be a big movie star uh after jacob's ladder yeah this is your friend this is a big one  now it's a big one it's the one that turned it around what are you doing jacob's ladder i forgot  you were in there i'm the whiner who said to him in the bathtub he was in the bathtub it was me and  the dog and the dog was the best thing in that scene that's great yeah i know yeah it was you you  must have friends in high places it's cool when you when you watch that you know you watch an old 
[01:35:00]  movie or something and you just you go hey wait a minute yeah it's lewis you did a book uh you did  like four flicks a book another special it's like yeah yeah another special and i did a the special  for comedy central and then i did another and i did a pilot for uh for um for comedy central about red  states which they didn't oh it's you know he doesn't yell enough why isn't lewis yelling more are you  kidding no that was it we want that and this is something we told him we said you know i can't 
[01:35:30]  go down to red states and just scream at people you idiots you know it was all about football wait  a minute maybe you could well you could but it would be the end of you know it would be the you  know why don't i put a little you know you know jewish star on my back what do you think of hillary and  obama what do you think what what planet are we on thank you yeah but anthony won't answer the  question i i want to know if he had no choice would he vote for a female president or a black 
[01:36:00]  president i can't get an answer from this guy because you're giving me two choices that will  not win in this country in 2008 or 2009 i agree with that it's it's not we're not ready as a country  we we look great in this big cities we're very open-minded and liberal and people go oh we can but  look at him he's building up steam and hillary's already got wednesday election it she's she's gonna  blow the load as they say she's too exposed right now and it's a goof ticket get a i'm sorry to say 
[01:36:30]  this it might sound racist but this is the the country we live in the democrats need a moderate  white gentleman that sounds like he's not insane to just connect with the masses and run and he will  win it's a given no one's voting republican unless you put a black guy or a woman on the democratic  ticket then all middle america is going to go well here we go again yeah i i think i think uh that's 
[01:37:00]  what i've been saying and then when you say it when you do these you know because i'm doing these print  interviews and stuff because a lot of the other thing about doing what what happens when this you  know this thing when you made the transition to this you know how many how many times do you how many  interviews can you do with it exactly we match it was you know that kind of stuff so the so they're  always you know so it's like uh you know the you're doing these interviews you're doing three to four  hours a day sometimes twice a week to promote the shows that you're going to do down the road you know 
[01:37:30]  literally two weeks from now in in youngstown ohio right and peachtreeville georgia and uh well you think  your stuff will go over there no they're going to shoot me that's why i'm going but but when you  have to answer those questions like for the press and stuff all of a sudden you're going it's exactly  it i'm going look um would i want a black man elected i would love a black man elected would  colin powell been great yeah did he screw things up yeah yeah so now we get this guy i said you know 
[01:38:00]  my problem with him is not that he's uh that he's black my problem with him is what do you do  yeah but now we're going to just grab him get that kid in the back get him up here he's been in  the fifth grade he's been in the sixth grade he's in the seventh grade he can write i mean they're  insane you're absolutely right he's a terrific speaker where is unbelievable if a black man is 
[01:38:30]  articulate he is run for president he didn't say yo be in the middle of his speech run for president  and why don't you help in this transition from total insanity you know why don't you do that why  don't some of you who are running now instead of going well i'm going to send out some see let's see  if i can run what when did they have how many all of a sudden it's an exploratory committee  i mean it's like literally people just use that now i'm exploring the fact of being a president 
[01:39:00]  i built a mock-up white house i sit at the desk and i let it soak in and say could i do this  exploratory committee used to just be people said i am announcing my candidacy for the president of  the united states of america now there's exploratory because no one wants to commit to  anything i didn't announce i'm running i'm setting up an exploratory committee and people  are going to go around and take polls and do this and do that and see if it comes back that's so they  can save face with themselves right if they totally bomb if they totally bomb you know they do something 
[01:39:30]  that it's like i was exploring looking like a moron right and lunatic and uh i decided not gonna run  for president i was seeing how that worked and it didn't work well because i realized everyone hated me  do this transition where you got you got 42 people running now yeah 14 of them like kind of help  figure out what we're going to do get behind a guy guy the democrats have to learn the republicans  they fight amongst themselves too but they're a little better at when push comes to shove you get 
[01:40:00]  behind the guy and and run him well they proved it with this one oh yeah this one exactly except  even now they got behind him very early in the game huh you anti-bush what do you think now it's  not even anti it's like it's like it's criminal when when i when it reaches the point where what i  said at the very beginning is true that now we've got like 28 percent of the american people 
[01:40:30]  kind of go thank you but you know he's phenomenal yeah wait a minute two percent of the american  people is it up to 70 percent yeah when he first got elected a lot of what lewis said about him  got huge laughs because it was that um uh exaggeration humor as they call it now it's just  the news it's called the true it's called what's happening it's really weird like kreskin his approval  rating really is down as 28 28 percent was the cbs last time i looked it was like 33 yeah it's 33 yeah 
[01:41:00]  there's 33 and 28 and there's a bunch of wow that's it when it gets to 20 bye because it's going  back up where do you i said the thing that my favorite new thing about uh about bush is i said  that here's what happens you see um the thing that has always bothered me and i've said this from the  very beginning that you know a lot of the times his face doesn't match his words and that's creepy  and when it happens 10 times a week there's obviously a disconnect yeah but nobody seems to notice  everybody's like well that's that's not a bad thing yeah why doesn't someone call him out or 
[01:41:30]  well why didn't somebody just slap him and go you know look when you're talking about the rack you  have to have a frowny face so i think what happens is this the the you know to get from here you know  in your brain to your mouth is maybe three inches that's how far it's got to go so you it's not that  far it doesn't go down around your ankles come back come back so what i think is is that he has the  thoughts and it starts to go down and when inside his head when the words start to move what he hears 
[01:42:00]  in his head is the sound of a of an ice cream truck bell and he runs i want to i want a creamsicle  and he runs and he gets his creamsicle so by the time the words are coming out he's not really  conscious anymore of speaking he's looking at creamsicle you you know what you know what they  should do uh at the white house they should have like emotion flash cards for him where they hold  up words and he's got to make the face like iraq and if he if he goes you know they go no no that's 
[01:42:30]  a frowny one like training a monkey at the zoo no no let's try it again it's all right iraq uh the  economy i like when you're absolutely right he gets at the podium and he goes you know people are  dying over there wait was he giggling was he chuckling at the prospect of people dying and he 
[01:43:00]  always has that weird smirk a little smirk he smirks at everything and there's someone always  in the crowd that he's winking to or giving like a little heads up and it's almost like a  can you believe i still got this down can you actually give him a little link you believe  i'm still here i think he's doing that to nobody and that thing people are looking around i'm going  who's yeah i think he's doing it to nobody like me but let's say he likes me hey oh did you notice  that joseph biden said he's going to run now that's how bad the democrats are he's like well why not  yeah he's joined this morning yeah but but biden and the guy who's the other one there was somebody 
[01:43:30]  else out in the middle of nowhere that was running and then you know who i like but but hasn't got  a chance is hagel hagel who i'd like is that the guy that they were saying who yeah exactly the guy  from nebraska hey somebody got one who actually further was the one republican from the very  beginning like before we went in it was the reason i kept saying uh i think you ought to listen to this  guy i know he's from nebraska but i've performed there so maybe you ought to listen to him he's one 
[01:44:00]  of the armed forces committee's guys and he from the very beginning he's going i don't think we got a  plan uh i i don't think we got enough guy planned complete and total victory but he wasn't he's not  like a mccain he's not out there all the but he's literally he was on meet the press like 500 times  going uh and the other thing i think about him he'll show up on any show and he doesn't do the  making he'll just come in and go like pops on i've been this is the fifth show today could somebody  listen to me you know and he's got he's got one percent yeah i mean he's oh yeah it's just running 
[01:44:30]  hey let's let's go to robin in jersey robin what's up hey guys robin i was just thinking i was just  thinking that this country's coming to the point where we should just have presidential idol on the  wb 11 have presidential idol that'd be good they could come in deliver like speeches and then have  somebody an english guy just going that was completely horrible an abominable speech you  have the judges pick them and then have the country make the final decision i kind of likes you you get 
[01:45:00]  you really connected with the people and i think you'll make a great dog that's good what you were  saying about unemployment as a you're going to washington dog right hey that's a great idea  use the reality show format to pick the next president so hillary this is just a joke when  does it go wrong for her well we got two years when does it go wrong for us i'm the only one i'm  what we're the only people i'm worried about is us so these are two years of this i love her campaign 
[01:45:30]  slogan let the conversation begin ew is that it are you kidding something like that yeah something  about conversation begin let the conversation begin ew dork it's just maybe you should have done that  with your husband a little conversation about his sexual promiscuity there's just too much reading  on the banner it's like let the cut what let that it has to be short until the point but here's another  case of you know if it wait you know wait uh why don't you wait four years why don't you wait eight 
[01:46:00]  years you know when you're uh you know 67 why don't you wait so that we can kind of you know we don't  need to i don't need to watch this tv series again okay i mean i'll grant you the economy was great it  was really fun and things are terrific and hootah and and we all of our careers started to take a  little go in the right direction and it was a wonderful time right i want to go back there no  now we got real good you know just stuff to deal with now it's like a nut house it does sound like a 
[01:46:30]  sitcom now she's the president and he's the first full man of the he was the president of the united  states and she was the wife who doesn't want to see him as the first man though now that has some  possibilities you know that just canned laughs i just picture him in a robe and pajamas interrupting  the white house tours you know what she come on in here watch some television i said don't worry  about what she's doing i have no clue how great would it be if you just embarrassed her and ruined her 
[01:47:00]  presidency too you gotta root for it just for that scandal yeah it just destroys her legacy  wah wah wah cam laughs by the way lewis is here to promote uh farce of the penguin yeah i saw the uh  what day uh sunday i guess it's a good movie yeah you know it's uh now on dvd we've just it didn't go  to the movie theaters no bob said we would have gone in the movie since we went to dvd because uh  that scares people when a movie goes right to dvd but this movie's uh it's funny uh so i'm wondering 
[01:47:30]  why didn't it go into the theater you you know because they uh nobody wanted it so seriously i  don't know i literally don't i think they made a mistake take off on march of the penguins obviously  but they're talking dirty and they're farting a lot of a lot of uh you know what jokes and yeah  and it's funny and samuel jackson is the narrator is the narrator and morgan freeman and bob and i  play the two penguins going to get to going to get it and tracy morgan plays the psychotic black 
[01:48:00]  pen tracy morgan tracy morgan has obama the penguin tracy morgan is hilarious and he's nuts in this  and there was and it's and it's funny and so i don't know i thought until about six weeks ago we  were going i was surprised because uh as soon as i got i'm like oh boy i went right to dvd oh boy this  ain't good but this is for goof we threw it in the other night and we're all laughing our asses off  yeah and for the potheads out there go get farce of the penguins and for the potheads do a little  of that and you're going to really really enjoy uh farce of the penguins oh man you should come with 
[01:48:30]  joints in it well you know and i was still sober by the way i really was and i was enjoying it it's  it's funny and then and then the reason bob is in here is his pop past now oh and so i said i'm  then i'm gonna go sneak in there and torture you guys that works all right and we worked out our  differences with lewis people are like why aren't you calling him out we were like when we got back  to radio lewis used to do our show all the time when we got back to the uh radio we were kind of  bummed at you because you didn't come in and uh do our show live yeah you did like a five-minute 
[01:49:00]  phone call with us and then you're on howard's show in studio and that quite frankly pissed us off i'm  sure and our audience not because he did that because a lot of other guys do both shows yeah we don't  give a crap but because you didn't come and visit us yeah yeah we felt left out and it was almost like  well this is the best i could do for these guys because i'm a big star now i'll give him a quick  phone call no that wasn't you used to battle back in the day over politics it's a lot of fun it's  kind of scary because you guys are kind of agreeing here a little back in the day we've been this 
[01:49:30]  insanity that's going on in the world today has pushed me and lewis closer which just goes to show  you how crazy the world has gotten no it is it's now we agree i want to make it perfectly clear man  back in the day these guys would scratch their eyes out well bush sucks i was also the first  person to say what about yemen that's right that's right i was quoted as saying what about yemen i had  my eye on them that's right the famous quote from anthony that was my favorite and then you kept  bringing it back they'd come in every two weeks and he'd still be doing i was going off on yemen

[01:54:00]  uh or fiction uh science fiction writer yeah wow what about man isn't man cave it's the guy's name who  runs it what's his name the last name i don't know man cave no man cave is some really weird name  of a guy who runs the actual little man cave ish what about you but the uh did you read the other one  there was one that i just saw somebody something excuse me about the puerto rican who has the church that  is now there's like a hundred thousand members but it is like three point five million worldwide or  whatever and he he claims that uh he is now he's claiming he's christ oh really always a good move 
[01:54:30]  then he said and then after he claimed he was christ and that lasted a while he said he's actually  really not christ he's the anti-christ because christ was the christ oh and and by any christ it's not  a bad thing right you kind of go once you get into that level of explanation i think you've lost me  he's a good antichrist he's a perfect all right he's freaking religions man he's the christ you  see in the in the mirror and whatever the religions oh yeah no kidding it's it's unbelievable you watch 
[01:55:00]  these guys but what what do the sunnis and the shiites what is religiously where's the yeah where's  the nation there what is it that uh one of them have you know kind of spend more time on the on the uh  rug than the others yeah i'm not too uh hip on the religion there but i kind of don't see any  difference i don't know what they do with how they worship i don't i mean what you know what is  is that the fundamental difference no it's it's basically that one advocates uh decapitations and 
[01:55:30]  one advocates your headings here's the here's why a country can't go to where trent lott said you  know i don't know why these people are killing each other i the sunni and the shiites i can't tell the  difference oh there you go you know that's something you think okay you can think it you  don't but don't say it loud or you can do it on radio yeah of course we can do it on a mic in front 
[01:56:00]  of you you're a senator their games yeah let's let's go to jp and me their butts yeah jp what's up  hey i was kind of curious what you guys about uh giuliani running for president oh that's great too  isn't it that's just terrific three days of work he did while he was the mayor after 9-11 great great  for three days uh living under him was i know that probably you disagree you don't see this he spent

[02:01:00]  walter cronkite sit there and deliver the news with integrity there'll be a guy spinning plates and eating  cake while a parrot shoots a basketball through a hoop and you're just going what what happened  well today what the hell happened today let's not forget they went to some bakery and a guy is uh  uh uh making football bread he's baking like bread loaves pumpernickel that look like uh 
[02:01:30]  uh it looks nothing like footballs but it looks like a football if it was stretched out to four feet  yeah that's it well there'll be you know there'll be 350 hours on you know what what what chili to  make yeah you know it was actually uh like a five foot piece of pumpernickel and i thought they were  doing a tribute to the harlem globetrotters and then we'll see and then we're going to see every  commercial what are you going to see commercials every ball well give it you're going to show us the  commercials before the super bowl yeah now they show a little preview well nothing like it's like 
[02:02:00]  it's an exploratory committee for commercials so they do before committing to the super bowl  it's really it's beyond and then that i've been screaming about this the writing underneath the  screen oh yeah the ticker i've done cnn three times and uh i literally will go i'm not i'll be as  soon as we go on the air i go get rid of it get rid of it get rid of it i ain't talking get rid of it  yeah do they yeah and they do i won't i won't i'm serious i'm going do you understand i'm here why  am i here if you got the writing there why don't you just have me type at home people are going to 
[02:02:30]  be reading yeah thinking they're going to be reading and not only that you look at it too  long and then you look at your room and it's spinning the opposite direction you ever look  at the ticket for so long that it does something to your eyes where the room starts going the other  way i'm looking at this ticker too long i've seen the same story go by three times it's so  unbelievable i mean it's it's like an add i've had add yeah since they started doing box up in the  corner this one the ticker it's the internet that's what the internet is making television 
[02:03:00]  seems so slow yeah you can go online go to drugs go to 50 other sites and get exactly what you want  you don't wait you have to put something to make tv faster and it's just lousing it up yeah you don't  want to waste the story i'm there so that i can they talk to me so i don't have to read it and i can  lie on the couch and touch myself that's the concept hey uh before we get out of here uh we forgot to  talk about the cop killer oh yeah yeah i got the uh death penalty got the death penalty  and this is in this is in new york yes i want to just make sure it's very rare that this happens 
[02:03:30]  in new york that anyone gets the death penalty happened in staten island this uh this uh youth  oh okay i said new york sorry uh we all know staten island is part of jersey so black kid kills two  black officers back of the head executing style so no race card could be played and they decided to  uh give him the death penalty yesterday and he's uh sticking his tongue out at the widow he's  yeah yeah but now a judge um can overturn the jury's decision and of course you know the judge is here in 
[02:04:00]  new york uh pretty liberal so i think i don't see i don't see it get life you're wrong i i don't  know and then he's got the appeal process uh which isn't like the saddam one boy that's a quickie  wow get your scarf on here's your appeal right you're you're at your appeal and standing on a  trap door that's not a good sign that's some justice system they got there i love when  when like is just below the trap door yeah you just go down there for a minute it's so funny when 
[02:04:30]  people praise that you know it's so good to see democracy at work over there and in iraq and it's  like okay you have your trial and your appeal hang them that's it done and it's like all in the same  day coat and hat on like he was going to out to dinner he probably thought he was going out to  dinner he thought he was going on the olive garden yeah it's like where are we going today oh don't  worry about it you had a tough uh it's like a democracy i've seen american democracy this takes 
[02:05:00]  years i should be what is that gallows what the hell i don't am i i'm supposed to get on bail like  just hanging out yeah the american democracy is a little different what happened well when did they  reinstate the death penalty it's been almost what when pataki got in 15 how many years ago we haven't  killed one person with it yeah and we haven't killed a person here in new york since 1954 who was it  who knows heavily do you do you think well keep my fingers crossed after the rose rose and bark 
[02:05:30]  but he sticks his tongue out at uh widow the headline is fry baby this is never gonna happen  baby they will not kill this kid he should he will not kill him even though they sentenced him uh  to death maybe the guards will put crushed glass in his uh in his food or something well even if he  does get the death penalty and it sticks and the appeal process and stuff uh who do we got in there now  spitzer elliot spitzer is just gonna yes take the death penalty and throw it out the window anyway  so all the uh the death penalty sentences will be commuted to life if they distract him they can 
[02:06:00]  distract him can they distract him with something with some sort of if you know just to distract him  with some sort of cash problem a cash problem perhaps a restaurant that isn't serving the right  amount of food per dollar that was a busy body that's what he was known as a busy body after some  weird things man yep like he's going after radio guys for plugola and and payola yeah stop just  stop it already that's his thing you know but that's his whole you know that starts with you know

[02:13:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  And the second half of the Opie and Anthony show begins now.  And the second half of the O.P. and Anthony show begins now.  Be funny.  Hey, it was good to see Louis Black, huh? 
[02:14:00]  Sounds good.  Very good to see him.  There it is.  Very happy that Louis Black is going to be a regular again.  Well, I saw Louis at the HBO for a comic relief.  I was there.  I was backstage and I saw Louis.  Of course you were.  Oh, yeah.  I had to be.  I wasn't going to perform.  No.  But I think that actually helped me a lot going on at that festival.  I was talking to him.  He goes, yeah, how are the guys, man?  I really want to come see them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was like, I hate what happened.  And I'm like, well, you'll be honest with me. 
[02:14:30]  They're a little hurt.  I mean, you know, you went to Howard.  Whatever.  I told him the truth.  They're hurt.  You know, you guys are not happy.  But he was like, yeah, I really want to come see them.  So I'm glad he did.  All right.  Let's say hi to Darren.  He's in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Vegas.  Darren, what's up?  What's up, boy?  Welcome aboard.  Hey, Darren.  Well, thank you, sir.  I just wanted to thank you guys for recognizing us, Pest Out West.  I'm the co-leader.  P-O-Ws.  Me and Louis Bucky kind of got this thing going.  You're the co-leader of the Pest Out West fan club?  P-O-Ws. 
[02:15:00]  Yes, sir.  I am P-O-W number seven.  Oh, that's sweet.  I got the card going, and we're going to be going to Rich Voss here on the 10th of February  out at the Palms, and we're going to be handing out P-O-W cards out there and just  spreading the virus and getting it going.  Well, let's go to the big-ass prize closet.  Get this guy something.  How ironic.  What do we got, Fez?  How ironic did Voss and his little hands are working at a place called the Palms.  Ah, little sweetie.  Bite his little hand.  Tiny Palms.  Old doll hands. 
[02:15:30]  Well, we got a little website that gets a nice little redirect, but it's PestOutWest.com,  and it'll take you to our home little forum that old Doug Out Doug set up for us, and  thank you, Doug Out Doug.  You are the man.  Oh, boy.  That means the Wackbag guys don't acknowledge the Pest Out West.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Pest Out West.  .NET doesn't like Wackbag.  Wackbag doesn't like Pest Out West.  Pest Out West doesn't like Ogresh.  The Ogresh doesn't like the Game of the Health Crisis.  What the fuck's the matter with everybody? 
[02:16:00]  But they all love the O.P. and Anthony show, but there's so many different factions now.  I love the factions.  It's hilarious.  We're just sitting back and laughing, and we're enjoying it.  Nobody likes anybody.  All right.  But, yeah, we're so psyched that the Pests are growing Out West there.  Pests Out West.  The POW.  Yes.  All right, Darren.  Thanks.  All right.  Where does Out West cover?  Is that just like Vegas West?  Because the name is cool.  I would say West of the Rockies.  Okay.  I don't know.  What about the Mississippi? 
[02:16:30]  West of the Mississippi?  Oh, there's a map.  There's a map?  They have a map?  What wackos.  Wait a minute.  Half the country.  Jesus, I know.  Everybody west of Elizabeth.  Fucking Pennsylvania.  Come on.  What is that state right there?  The big square.  That is Utah.  No, no.  Wait a minute.  Which one?  That's Wyoming.  All right.  Let's work backwards.  That's California.  Washington's above it.  Nevada.  That's Nevada.  Oregon's above it.  What's that one? 
[02:17:00]  And then Washington.  That's Idaho.  That's not Idaho.  Yeah, that little pointy top one.  Oh, that's Idaho.  Yeah.  What's that one?  Montana.  Oh.  That's Oregon.  Ew.  Oregon and Washington.  Jersey.  Montana.  Wyoming.  Wait, this is Montana?  Yeah.  What's that one?  That's Wyoming.  What's that one?  That is, uh...  I don't know these.  Colorado.  They're all squares.  Colorado.  New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah.  But it's stupid.  These three are all squares.  Three squares in a row. 
[02:17:30]  Makes it all confusing.  That, where they meet, is called the Four Corners.  Thank you.  You guys still there?  Yeah, unfortunately.  I'm so proud of myself.  Hold on, sir.  El Nerdo was talking.  Four Corners.  Thank you.  All right, Darren.  Good luck with the pests out west.  Okay, and it's our policy.  We're above the factions.  We like all the message boards.  All right.  There you go.  Well, sir, you took the cool name.  Now, pests out east.  They have to call themselves Poe. 
[02:18:00]  Gentlemen.  Oh, gentlemen.  Gentlemen, I am your God.  To assault on the media, gentlemen.  I am Jesus.  We call the media and tell them we're going to assault them before we do it, gentlemen.  And then, perhaps, I will take away the sign before the camera gets rolling.  Yes.  Because anything with humor, we're going to remove because it's a cancer.  I think the Canadian pests are going to be the great white pests.  Yeah.  What about the Canadian pests?  Yeah, there's two of them.  Is there an organization up there yet?  No.  Of course not.  Goody two-shoes up there. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, don't want to get in trouble, eh?  Pests of Canada?  Pock.  Just a pock.  All right.  Thank you, Darren.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  I got to go load some cow shit.  You guys have a good day.  All right, fellas.  Hey, what's your name, by the way?  Darren.  No, man.  Everyone's got a nickname.  Oh, Gunslinger.  There you go.  Gunslinger.  He's out west.  Come on.  I like you.  I'm Jimmy Mack.  Oh, Jimmy Mack.  Hi, Jimmy Mack.  You're such a sweet little guy.  Jimmy, I saw you in Vegas, man.  You were great.  Thank you very much, bud.  All right. 
[02:19:00]  Take care, man.  Thanks.  Hey, people are requesting the old Rick Springfield ticket bit.  Do we have that yet, E-Rock?  What?  We're not going to do it today, but I mean, you know.  Wow.  Maybe when we leave at 11 or something.  Good song.  On an edition of E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock Radio.  I was listening to some E-Rock Radio the other day.  That's great.  It is a combination of nostalgic, funny O&A bits that I kind of remember.  They fall through the cracks.  Yeah.  They fall through the cracks.  Because we don't have time to get into them right now.  And the entire staff just beating up E-Rock.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, and the callers beating up E-Rock.  It's wonderful.  He's very uncomfortable doing it.  Yes, he is.  You know why he's uncomfortable?  Because he can't do his radio voice.  No.  They all make fun of him.  Yeah, but.  They pick apart every little inflection.  Have E-Rock do E-Rock Radio with no one else and close all the blinds and let him be E-Rock.  And then goof on it later.  Because I've heard his radio voice before.  Can we get him in for one second?  I'd love to hear it.  Yeah.  All right.  Where is E-Rock?  He's right there.  On E-Rock Radio.  All right, E-Rock.  What? 
[02:20:00]  Now.  E-Rock, take the wireless mic.  I want you to turn around because I don't want you to get all nervous.  And I want you to do your actual radio voice from your old air checks.  Look who comes running and laughing.  No, because you don't do it.  You should do it.  Our own Sam with the camera.  You used to call letters and everything.  You know.  Because I could still do CQ-102 hit music and more.  Oh.  That's a lot deeper than you used to do it, though.  All right, well.  Okay.  More.  Hi.  B-A-B.  I told you what happened.  The equipment wasn't adjusted right. 
[02:20:30]  The tapes got stretched.  Yeah, the tapes went a little faster.  All right.  Do one of my old show stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your actual voice, because I've heard it.  Don't be shy.  Okay.  And we get to give you a pink belly if you do it wrong.  Oh.  That's right.  On your cock.  Or a light bone neck if you do it right.  Sorry.  All right, turn around, because we don't want you to, like, all nervous.  92.7 L-I-R. 
[02:21:00]  That was less than Jake.  Johnny Quest thinks we're sellouts here on One Step Beyond.  Coming up next is Real Big Fish sellout on One Step Beyond.  Die.  Oh.  You never worked for W-L-I-R.  Yeah, I did.  Oh, look at him.  Yeah, I did.  Call letters like alphabet soup this fuck.  Sunday nights at a punk ska show with my partner, Jay.  Who's talking about that shit, too?  Yeah, I know.  He's like, hey.  What about the Florida?  I want the Florida station.  Oh, okay.  Do that.  All right, he's turning around again.  Turn around and face the wall.  It was an 80s station, so.  All right, good. 
[02:21:30]  Even better.  And use the real voice.  This is the one I think I heard.  99.7 GNX.  Kajagoogoo, Too Shy Shy.  Before that, you had Toto with Africa.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  No.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  Rows down his mic in disgust. 
[02:22:00]  What happened, Sex Bagel?  That is always funny for some reason.  Never not funny.  Sex Bagel here with you.  Crash.  You see him jump?  All right, A-Rock.  Thank you.  Your voice is much faster.  You didn't do the, uh.  He talks faster.  What is that, Florida station?  Yeah.  I wanted to hear that one.  He talks faster.  Why does he talk faster like A-Rock Radio?  You forgot your line, Ant.  What?  Oh, what? 
[02:22:30]  Montage?  No, with the, uh, the chips.  Thank you.  They're all laying on the floor.  Oh.  Now clean it up!  Be a hack DJ.  Like your father.  That's right.  Be a fat neck, just like a bullfrog.  He's all happy that we wanted to listen to him.  He's a good guy.  Now we got a fat head.  We really didn't even get a radio voice out of him.  He was just kind of, he wasn't putting it on.  Yeah.  I think he should come back.  I want to hear the fucking radio voice.  All right. 
[02:23:00]  We have nothing else to throw.  Yeah, where is he?  Tell no one else to goof on him.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  That sucked.  What?  Oh.  This is radio.  All right.  That sucks.  You can leave.  I do want to hear the radio voice.  Nah, I didn't. 
[02:23:30]  See, Dan could have just held on to the ball.  I was hoping Dan would make the throw.  Just start playing hot potato with the kickball.  Yeah, we have a kickball, and there's nothing funnier than when someone gets blindsided in  the side of the head with that kickball when they think they're actually doing something  for the show or conversing with some of us, and they're real serious, and out of nowhere,  a kickball flies into the side of their head.  It is hysterical. 
[02:24:00]  And with Iraq turning his back, it would have been perfect for Dan to just wail that  into the side of his head.  Would you have thrown it hard?  Oh, come on.  Oh, my God.  That isn't even a fucking...  Then you gave it to me, and I'm like, I already did something, so then I tried a hot potato  it to Anthony.  And it bounced right off of the phone, and Iraq walked in right at that moment.  Ge-boing, ge-boing, ge-boing, ge-boing.  Oh.  The ball's bouncing.  Just like the first black astronaut, the jig was up.  What? 
[02:24:30]  No.  How hard would you have thrown it?  Can you throw it at the door?  I'm just curious.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, where's she...  Yeah, throw it at Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Picture...  Well, you said the door.  I'm just curious.  Like, realistically.  Yeah, wail him.  Honestly.  Yeah, honestly.  We're not killing the guy.  Oh.  It...  He didn't want to hit Pat, so he threw it at the door.  It bounced off the door, retaining much of its original energy, and slammed right into the  side of his face.  Did he hit you in the face, Pat?  Yeah.  Oh, poor boy.  Good old Pat. 
[02:25:00]  Poor Chubby Hetfield.  He's a good boy.  All right.  We were getting into this at the other place, and we ran out of time.  What other place?  I don't acknowledge that other place when we're here.  Oh, good point.  I'm like the listeners.  Good point.  I boycott it.  I'm all about XM.  Shut up.  What was waiting for us this morning, that freaking sales pitch?  Oh, it was...  You know, see, a lot of people...  Well, we'll pull the curtain a little bit.  A lot of people don't know what the hell we do before the show.  They assume we don't do any show prep, but we do. 
[02:25:30]  The guys get a lot of material.  We kind of talk about shit, and we like having that atmosphere in the office for the hour  before the show to kind of goof around, watch the news.  We goof on Mike Woods, the weather guy in New York, and just kind of get in the mood for the show.  Don't forget, we also warm up our radio voices.  Right.  We blow each other.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  That one got past everybody.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Where is... 
[02:26:00]  Here it is.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Here it is.  Here we warm up our voices.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  See, he was ready.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah.  Warm up.  And then this morning, there's just a two-page memo note thing for a sponsor  that we have a meeting on February 15th at 1230 for a meeting for this, 
[02:26:30]  and it's going to take this much time,  and then you've got to go down to this place and do...  It was really something that should be handled after the show in an email,  things like that.  We don't like getting that stuff thrown at us before the show starts.  Kind of as a downer, as they say.  A downer.  Mm-hmm.  But they don't understand that.  But that's all they throw at us before the show. 
[02:27:00]  Commercial radio man.  Is like sales pitches.  Yeah.  Maybe leaving us a nice little nugget for that show.  Yeah.  Maybe a little thing we might want to talk about.  Something like, wow, you guys might have missed this one, but here.  Dude, they're all business.  We really want to help out the show.  They are all business.  Commercial radio is, you know, it's just what it is.  It's what it is.  And you're not going to find another one, a company that's run differently.  It's just the way it's kind of mutated. 
[02:27:30]  It is all business now.  The creative end of it is the last thing on the priority list.  Yet they expect it to, you know, get ratings.  So they can sell more commercials.  And be successful.  I see regular radio going all infomercials eventually.  Yeah.  It's just going to be all infomercials.  That's what they do at night.  And a lot of the programming is turning into that kind of thing.  Game show radio.  They're actually selling the radio shows to the sponsors in this new way. 
[02:28:00]  It used to be, you know, you do a 60 second commercial and you would pick up a piece of  copy and read it or it would be prerecorded or something like that.  But now the stations are going to the sponsors and making these deals like we'll incorporate  it into the show somehow or the guys will just riff on it.  It's like, no, I'm not going to riff on a tire.  I'm not going to riff on fucking Firestone tires or something.  Hey, let me tell you something about my Firestone tires that I was driving on today. 
[02:28:30]  I ran over a small child and still had traction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would actually do that commercial.  It's just turned into this business-y kind of thing.  And I think our show, one of the last bastions of kind of rebellion and fun and creativity  in that environment.  We've kind of, you know, I think we're the kind of assholes that we don't know any better.  Yeah.  We're just fucking stupid, so we don't know any better. 
[02:29:00]  A lot of these shows either couldn't adapt and are gone or completely just tamed down  everything.  I think it's fun and I think it's great that we have this.  It's going to be very interesting the coming year.  Yep.  All right.  Here we go.  Tyra Banks on Good Morning America.  Can't get enough of Tyra Banks.  Tomorrow's the big show.  Fat ass.  Where she gets into that bathing suit that made her look fat.  Is she going to have a bunt?  Did she have a bunt in that one?  I only saw her ass.  I want to see Tyra's bunt.  She had huge thighs and she's all over the TV today in that same bathing suit because 
[02:29:30]  they're showing a clip.  Yeah.  And it's so obvious it's a smaller version of the bathing suit.  Yeah.  Why isn't anyone calling her out on that?  We are.  Shallow, shallow girl.  Just a pig.  Well, one of the clips.  She got camel toe in it?  That'd be nice too.  Big.  I hope so.  It probably stinks.  Fat.  One of the clips we're about to play, Tyra says tomorrow's response to her in the fat  bathing suit will be the most profound show she has ever done.  Stop it.  What about the homeless when she dressed like the homeless? 
[02:30:00]  What about the fat suit?  And then she says, you have to see this show.  Here's Tyra from Good Morning America this morning.  And Tyra Banks, host of the Tyra Banks show and of course America's Top Model, both very  successful, joins us this morning.  She's also been on the cover of People Magazine, by the way, looking great.  The question was, you call this fat and Tyra's with us now.  Hey, Tyra, good morning to you.  Hi, Diane.  How are you?  I am good.  So you go online, you Google under Tyra Phat and you see the photo of yourself there and 
[02:30:30]  see what people are saying.  And you said it was so mean and the rejoicing really threw you back on the deal.  Go there, Tyra Phat.  Go to Tyra Phat.  And you know what?  When I Googled, I had people telling me, Tyra, they say that you've gained about 40 to  50 pounds in a week.  You've got to go online and check this out.  So I go online and I Googled Tyra Phat and the first thing that came up was not the Australia  pictures.  It was pictures from my modeling career with people saying that I was fat.  And I just thought that was really awful because I'm 20 to 30 pounds heavier than the average 
[02:31:00]  model.  To this day, I'm still 30 pounds heavier than the average model.  And see, that's a positive thing.  And it's so sad that people were saying that that was bad.  And then I see these Australia pictures and I'm like, first of all, that's crazy.  My body doesn't look like that.  But if it did, so what?  So what?  She can't even admit that her body looked like that.  I know.  She can't commit to the fact that she was fat.  Yes.  And she lost the weight and that it doesn't matter.  But I'm kind of, you know, into being healthy or something. 
[02:31:30]  Or I was just out there.  I was on vacation.  I ate a lot.  Yeah, I took some time off.  Who doesn't?  Yo, yo.  Like, there's 20 ways she could have done this.  20 different ways she could have gone with this.  She went the worst fucking way possible.  The most pompous, self-centered ass way.  What could have been better, though?  Because we hate Tyra so much.  Yeah.  What could have been better than to just have her being called a fat pig?  You couldn't have made this any greater.  Because you know, no matter what she's saying, she is so bothered by this.  Killing her. 
[02:32:00]  So bothered.  She's making a big deal about she's posing next to the picture on her show, I guess,  in the same suit.  Yeah.  And the cutout that she's posing next to has clearly been blown up.  Oh, really?  Or she looks smaller next to it.  It makes her look smaller.  Apparently, she lost weight from her skull as well.  She's shorter.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I was very fat on the soles of my feet.  Yeah, it's not a...  Wow, yeah.  The cutout's definitely bigger than what she would be in real life as far.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  But you can still see that she's just so much fatter in the picture. 
[02:32:30]  What?  But she doesn't want to acknowledge that part of this.  Tyra fat.  To have to do that, to have to stand there next to your own cutout and go, I'm not fat.  See, guys?  Like, oh, it's great.  She knows she has nothing if she's not considered a hot piece of ass.  That's what it comes down to.  You're not going to see Oprah, who she wants to be, doing this.  You're not going to see Oprah going, look, man.  Like, they caught me looking fat, and look, I'm not fat.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She's fat.  She doesn't have a career if people start thinking she's fat.  Because they're not tuning in because of what she has to say. 
[02:33:00]  She's not getting anything done with her dumb show.  She's a supermodel.  So you took them on, on their headlines.  And you know what?  It's not even so much a fight against the tabloids.  It's a fight for women.  Like, this is the...  Oh.  Shut up.  Thank God for you, Tyra.  What a dope. 
[02:33:30]  What a dope.  This is awful.  Most guys will think, ugh, when they see someone's fat.  You're never going to change that.  Play that line again and stop it right after she says it, please.  Sorry, you took them on, on their headlines.  And you know what?  It's not even so much a fight against the tabloids.  It's a fight for women.  Just as stupid.  It's a fight for women.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:34:00]  She's contradicting herself in this whole thing.  If it's a fight for women, she should be the same weight she was in the suit.  Go in front of the news and go, yeah, I put on some pounds.  I'm a human being.  I don't have to be a skinny model anymore.  I enjoy living a normal life.  And I put on a few pounds.  Anyone got a problem with that?  I'm fighting for women because there are a lot of women that do have this body type.  And it's very hard to keep the body type of a supermodel.  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:34:30]  She could have gone on and on with that.  So her fighting for women is taking the criticism that she's fat and using it to put her fucking finger down her throat and lose that fucking weight.  That's not fighting for women.  There you go.  It's fighting for her own image, her self-image.  It's a very selfish thing she's doing.  Thank God she's doing it.  Of course.  She's got a great ass and hips and tummy when she's skinny.  By the way, I hope the guys are getting the Paris Hilton. 
[02:35:00]  Thank you, Ryan.  I almost forgot.  Show fodder alert.  Show fodder alert.  Ooh.  Don't want to say the website, but Paris Hilton sings about Jews and blacks on camera.  That's right.  Oh, no.  We had to save that one for over here.  Oh, I bet it's good.  It's a doozy.  Yeah.  We got that yet, then?  Paris singing about the Jews and the blacks we were going to do over there, but we realized...  I saw the kike.  But we realized we could do a much better job over here.  All right.  Here's...  Yeah, let's get back to Tyra Banks. 
[02:35:30]  So you took them on, on their headlight.  And you know what?  It's not even so much a fight against the tabloids.  It's a fight for women.  Like, this is the...  Diane, this is the most profound show I have ever done because I'm extremely vulnerable up there.  I haven't been sleeping.  Every night, I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning thinking about this, thinking about the response.  And the show that we're doing is...  All right.  For any woman that has ever been called fat or felt ugly or insecure or made fun of or any type of thing like that, this is... 
[02:36:00]  You have to see this show.  I love this.  She can't take any criticism because her entire life, people have said how hot she is, how beautiful you are.  She's gotten everything for nothing.  Like, everything for...  She's had to work as a model, but she's gotten things, like, without having to really apply a personality or anything because she's a very beautiful woman.  She's been programmed her entire life.  Yeah.  It's all about how hot, you're beautiful.  Her brain, like, short-circuit, like, wait.  You should be a model. 
[02:36:30]  You are a model.  They're making fun of me.  You're the best model.  This thing, I'm fat.  What?  What?  What happened?  My brain's not wired this way.  She cannot take it.  This couldn't be any better.  Does not compute.  Does not compute.  Does not compute.  Smoke comes out of her ears.  She's a mess.  It's like she tried to install Vista.  Right.  It was like Vista fucking Tyra Banks version of Vista.  Vista.  It just, it did not boot.  She can't understand it.  Her eyes went blue with the fatal blue error screen. 
[02:37:00]  She's been protected her entire life.  And if somebody said to you, look, we're going to arrange it so she's called fat and America's  top waddle, and I would have signed up for that in a second I would have taken that.  This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Is this spoiled, overindulged brat being called a fat pig everywhere.  And all she's doing is drawing more attention to it.  More attention to it.  Other models have been called that over the years.  They've, you know.  Yeah, they, well, yeah, sure. 
[02:37:30]  Heroin addict.  Well, she is fat, though.  My God.  Yeah, she really, compared to the models now.  She ballooned up.  Love those models now.  See them?  Just bony.  Big fucking kneecaps like a newborn calf.  That's what I want to see.  I'm still a woman that has insecurities just like every woman.  I just don't let it kill me and get to me.  I'm 151 pounds when I sit.  Yeah, you know what?  You don't let it get to you, huh?  Yeah, it got to you.  Trust me.  And Mike from New York's got a great point. 
[02:38:00]  Mike, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  If she is really fighting for women, how come there's no heavyset girls or fat bitches  on Top Model?  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Except for her.  She has another show.  She has another show that exploits women's body.  Skinny, attractive model.  The actual, what they want to see on the runway.  The very skinny girls.  Meanwhile, see her on a runway.  Instead of just pushing like a bigger girl and trying to get like alternative looking 
[02:38:30]  models through and changing that image, she is just feeding right into it.  Yeah.  What an ass.  Yeah.  Feeding.  I'm still a woman that has insecurities just like every woman.  I just don't let it kill me and get to me.  I'm 161 pounds.  When I sit down and I have on tight jeans, like I get the little thing that folds over  my jeans.  Little thing.  That's me.  And I don't like it. 
[02:39:00]  And I wish it wasn't fair.  But am I going to starve myself to make it?  Then do a sit up.  Yeah.  Then do a sit up.  I've showed discipline, Tyra.  Why don't you?  And eat a salad.  She makes it sound like when she sits down, she gets this little, little fold of skin  that goes over the front of her pants.  No, it's more than that.  And you know what, some women, it happens to them and they're fine with that.  She's not fine with that.  Then do some exercising.  Eat a few salads.  Take care of the problem.  You rock banks.  You were looking in the mirror and you want some pot? 
[02:39:30]  No, a pot belly.  That means that's me and I don't like it and I wish it wasn't fair, but am I going to starve  myself to make it not be there?  No.  Okay.  And on the show, Diane, tomorrow, on the show, I just want to tell you, on the show, I show  like the dimples in my booty, the cellulite.  I show the pictures from that same exact day in the same swimsuit in Australia with the  dimples in my booty, you know, looking thicker, but not to what those tabloids said.  But even if I look like that, it's okay. 
[02:40:00]  It's okay.  It's so cool.  Let the word go out.  The dimples will appear tomorrow.  Dimples.  Unretouched photos, everything.  So, if it's okay, then why are you making such a big deal about it?  She's unraveling.  She's unraveling.  Oh, yeah.  She's losing it, man.  She stinks.  Dimples on her booty.  It's okay, then just ignore it, then.  Yeah.  Then just ignore it.  You know what the tabloids do, but in this case, it doesn't look like they had to do much  of anything.  Please keep hitting her. 
[02:40:30]  Please.  Snap the picture.  Oh, this is great.  This is...  Love it.  All right.  I want to decide which laugh track I want.  No, that's the cricket.  I'm just setting my...  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Tyra, again, thanks for being with us.  Congratulations on your eighth season.  A lot of success out there on TV.  I was really nervous to do this interview with you, Diane.  I'm really happy.  I'm very vulnerable with this.  I cry on the show tomorrow.  It's very...  It's the most profound thing I did.  I want you to watch, too.  Are you going to watch? 
[02:41:00]  I will watch, and I've been thinking a lot about what is the answer to meanness and  rejoicing, the kind you saw on the internet, and maybe it is just tackling it head on and  say, hey, do we want to be the people who do this?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, she's doing it for ratings, you old twat.  Of course, she mentioned the show.  The show, the show.  She's plugging the show.  The show.  Are you going to watch?  Are you going to watch?  It's the most profound show.  I'm here promoting this show.  I've ever done.  Show, show, show, show.  I'm going to show that my ass isn't fucking perfect. 
[02:41:30]  Ooh.  She's going to get huge ratings tomorrow.  With her huge ass.  With her huge ass.  Nice.  Her huge ass is getting her huge ratings tomorrow.  I'm fighting for women.  I show the dimples on my booty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On her booty.  Wow.  Spoken like Gloria Steinem.  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  Let's go to John in Pennsylvania.  John?  By the way, I would like, can we get a real feminist on the phone?  Can we?  And see what she, no, they would not come on the show.  I bet you they would.  And see what they think about that. 
[02:42:00]  Can we call somebody from now?  We really are sick of hearing, she's not fighting for women.  I bet you that you would get a real feminist on the phone.  I'd be very interested to hear how they are taking this nonsense.  Hey, did Roland even try to get Tyra on?  Well.  Ah, that's a stretch.  Yeah.  All we do is treasure.  We've done nothing but treasure.  Yeah.  Well, Roland's really not getting the guess we want.  He's like, hey, the doctor from The Last King of Scotland's available for your show. 
[02:42:30]  And I'm like, well, how about Forrest Whitaker?  Right.  I get Ernie Banks.  Well, I thought that was an utter bomb.  Thanks.  I had to think about that one.  I liked it.  It's always the guy.  Ernie Banks joked to that guy.  It's the guy real close to the guy that we want to get.  It's never the guy.  Yeah.  We need the guy.  When you think The Last King of Scotland, you think Forrest Whitaker. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  End of story.  Do you guys want someone from Black Sabbath?  Okay.  Well, he's the guy that directed it.  No, not the movie.  No, no.  Oh, the band.  We have Pete Osborne, his cousin.  All right, so we got a guy that looks like Jack Osborne.  Hey, you can get along.  What's up, John?  Hey, man.  Hey, John.  Just me.  Or does Tyra sound exactly like Howard during the whole Howard didn't care thing? 
[02:43:30]  Just repeating that she doesn't care?  Yeah, she doesn't care.  She doesn't care, but she's doing a whole show about it.  She cries.  Yeah.  She shows her ass.  She lost weight.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing it for women all over.  Most profound show ever, but I don't care.  It's our theory.  If you have to say you don't care that many times, you really do care in the end.  Does anybody else think she's a phony?  No.  The news fucking people don't call her out on it.  Yeah, no one's really picking up on this.  She is hard.  And did they say eight seasons?  Yeah, she's right.  Of what?  Of what? 
[02:44:00]  They said, congratulations on your eighth season.  Well, they do it differently on TV now.  You can do like two or three seasons in one year.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I figured I might be a top model.  Oh, a top model probably.  It can't be eight years, though.  A top model.  They do one every other month.  Oh, okay.  I want somebody.  Is it wrong if I pay somebody to somehow get to?  Oh, no.  I hope not.  I want her to see a sign that says Tyra is a self-centered fat pig.  Yeah.  I'll pay $500.  Oh.  $500.  It makes the news I got another $500. 
[02:44:30]  No problem.  If someone can show the photo.  No problem.  No filter, Paul.  You need some cash?  Here's the deal.  Yes.  I got $500.  Jimmy's got $500.  And it's got $1,000.  That's right.  And a Vista.  Copy of Vista.  That's right.  And a copy of Vista.  For anybody that wants it.  What's the sign say?  Just wipe the feces off of it.  Tyra, you know you're fat.  I want pig in there.  It has to be small.  Okay.  Old fat pig.  Tyra is a fat pig. 
[02:45:00]  It's mean.  We all see it.  That old gag.  I love that gag.  We all see it.  We all see it.  Come on.  Don't worry.  We all see it.  Tyra is a fat pig, but she has to see it.  Yeah.  Well, dude.  She definitely has to see it.  Going into her show.  All I'm saying, if all of a sudden I made it on a live shot, that would be very funny.  Something like that.  Tyra could certainly go viral.  So, yeah.  We're looking for that. 
[02:45:30]  Thanks.  All right.  Help us out.  By the way, I decided for the rest of the show.  Yeah.  Inside references for the rest of the show.  Oh, really?  From the old days.  Just throw some in from the old days.  Yeah.  Nice.  Let's see if they pick up on them.  Cool.  Now, you just got to think of one.  Shut up.  You're going to read it.  Oh, wow.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks.  You're going to read it.  You're going to read it.  Who was that?  We don't give the answer.  No.  Of course not.  Jimmy, you got one?  You just have to know.  Some very inside reference from an older show. 
[02:46:00]  Just think about it.  All right.  All right.  First person in space.  My God.  By the way, we do this all the time, and we're finally acknowledging it.  There are times that night, especially, we'll go back to, like, AAF stuff and just say it.  Yeah.  And then make ourselves laugh.  Just blurt it out and laugh.  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  Yeah, of course I got that one.  That was a good one. 
[02:46:30]  This is the Harrington house.  Harrington house.  Well, I got to talk about that one, because it was one of, we had done a lot of the same  type of wacky phone call things based on people calling the wrong number and stuff like that.  It's one of our, we had a lot of near miss, near misses.  Yeah.  Near miss bits.  That one was so fucking funny, because no one, I'd never heard anyone do it before.  I'd never heard, like, you have the basic prank phone call thing, but I never heard 
[02:47:00]  anyone do this.  I guess, did the guy make a call the wrong number?  No, we were calling people.  We were calling people.  And Ope took this tack where it was, he knows the guy, and he's like his family somehow.  And he's coming over his house with company.  Do we have it?  Do we have it?  Do we have it?  And he wants to see, and he's mentioning names.  It is so fucking out there.  And the guy doesn't know what to say.  He's like, yeah, well, I'll be coming over with, you know, with Barbara and stuff. 
[02:47:30]  And she's so excited to see the kids.  And so we're making spaghetti with spaghetti tonight and stuff.  And the guy's just like, who do you want to talk to?  He gets all confused.  He goes, you, you know, we plan on coming over.  We're bringing the kids.  I'm sure you haven't seen him in a while.  You're real, you know, I'm sure you're psyched.  But this is the Harrington house.  It was some guy that was really kind of confused to begin with.  So we kind of lucked out.  Oh, it was great. 
[02:48:00]  And Ope's just rattling off these things like he's got plans.  And plans were made for months to come over and visit this guy.  And this guy didn't know what the fuck he was talking about.  That was a great gag.  What are you writing down, Steve?  There's a mic right there.  This is the Harrington house.  I was just going to say the reps for the National Organization of Women have declined.  But we're looking for another feminist group.  Why did they decline?  Because they got to eat snatch.  They can't get to a phone.  Not interested in commenting.  Oh.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  That must mean they hate us.  All right.  Are we looking for the Harrington house phone call?  It's a near miss.  It's missing something.  But the concept was pretty.  How did they ask?  By the way, how did they ask the National Organization of Women?  What was said?  Hey, cunt.  Do you want to come on the phone?  That might have gotten them on.  I want to know.  But was it like, hey, the Opie and Anthony show is looking for Tyra comments?  I don't think so.  I think they went, hello.  Yeah, hi. 
[02:49:00]  Are you the head twat in charge?  Yes.  We're looking for a comment from the National Organization of Women on the situation with Tyra Banks being photographed.  And we'd like you to comment on it on our radio show.  No.  No comment.  He probably didn't even get to what show it was.  Yeah.  All right.  Did you even get to what show it was on the phone?  Yes.  You probably said Steve and the Opie and Anthony.  No, I didn't make the call.  I didn't make the call.  Steve from the band Foundry. 
[02:49:30]  Exactly.  Stephen Carr, you might recognize me.  Let me play some pendulum for you.  No.  We are revising the pitch method because we are no longer calling from the Opie and Anthony show.  We are now calling from XM Satellite Radio.  We need to lie to these bitches.  That's right.  Absolutely.  Who called?  The booking company.  All right.  Are we trying to find that bit?  Yes.  Okay.  We are trying to find it.  All right.  Danny's got something.  Why didn't we call him?  Danny, what does Danny have? 
[02:50:00]  It's the parasol.  Oh, we got...  Oh.  That'll be in a promo sometime.  I was just going, oh, it's together.  Why is it beeped?  It's not.  No, it's not beeped.  Don't yell at me.  Oh, this is going to be some terrific...  No.  Uh-oh.  Danny's like, it's all right.  What happened?  It's not vicious enough.  Well, no.  You know what it is?  Yeah.  We're so used to being so vicious that it's probably not vicious enough.  It's like bad video, camera, audio from like a party, so...  I mean, the audio's not so great, but you can hear what she's saying. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, man.  That made me scared.  Could be trouble.  They're counting on us, and I got scared.  Don't be...  Oh.  Oh.  He did get frightened.  You know what that is?  That's courage pushing fear out of your body.  When there's too much courage in there, it pushes the scaredness away.  And the scaredness is what smells bad?  Yes, that's all the scaredness dissipating. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, wow.  You too will be scared in about 10 seconds.  Yeah, I'm petrified.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you, Than.  A cloud of Febreze.  You might want to spray a shield around me.  All right.  We'll do this, and then we'll do that when we get back.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  They do all the talking for us.  We'll be in Anthony. 
[02:51:30]  Whip him out Wednesday.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[02:52:00]  It was reminding us of the day that I threw a strawberry at the intern's really nice shoes.  We thought it was a fruit.  You hated him because we thought he was rich, and you were right.  Yeah.  His father was going to sue.  I didn't like him because he was rich.  And we implied that he sounded like a gay gentleman.  Yeah.  And he came and dressed up in very expensive clothing, and Opie threw a strawberry, and  it landed on his shoe and stained his very expensive shoes.  He was dressing better than us.  What was he wearing? 
[02:52:30]  Like, it's not that we dress well, but the best intern story ever was the one that was  banging some, what, hot stripper or hot porn star?  A porn chair from Cleveland who came in, who was a little fat puss I really wanted to  indulge in.  And she wanted to charge me $1,000 to fuck her, and then she banged our intern, Noah, for free.  And then started dating him.  He just fucking, she thought he was adorable.  Oh, yeah, it was a thing where they used to, like, text each other, and that, and Jimmy 
[02:53:00]  wanted to, and she said it would be $1,000.  But she was throwing an intern her fucking gash for nothing.  Exactly.  I hope her porn career didn't work out.  Exactly.  Well, you told her, hope it doesn't work out for you.  Oh, forgive my, uh, hard flying.  Has Bill got something?  Yeah, her porn career didn't work out.  Apparently, she tried suing the companies that had her porn picture.  They pulled them off the internet.  Oh, that'll, uh...  Wait, what?  And apparently she had sex with her brother or something.  Wait, she had sex with her brother?  Yeah, something.  She was really messed up. 
[02:53:30]  Hot.  Oh, oh, did you do it?  Oh, yeah, Jimmy's, uh, very scared lately.  Very scared.  Enjoy the gas chamber you're sitting in.  I think I trailed some back in.  Oh, yeah, look at this.  That is really bad.  Actually, we got some behind-the-scenes audio during the last break.  This is what happened.  What's wrong with the Paris audio?  Is it just, is it not funny, or is it...  I farted on Steve while he's on the phone trying to sound official. 
[02:54:00]  Hi, this is, uh, Steve.  Hello, Steve C here, and I...  Uh, you might know me from Foundry Music.  Yes.  Steve C.  Pendulum. 
[02:54:30]  We had a hit back in 1991.  Pendulum.  We, uh, God, we were yapping about, um, the old AAF days, uh, during the commercials,  and I, I just, it brought back a lot of memories of bits, and then things we used to do, because  Opus A, and it doesn't seem that long ago, and for me, it seems like 18 million years ago.  Uh, so, uh, I learned something new about that, uh, this, by the way, very interesting.  Yeah?  Because obviously, uh, when we went to AAF in Boston, you were married.  Yep.  And you knew the day that you were gonna get divorced. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, I knew, I, I, I, I knew that the marriage wouldn't last, and it was because of the, uh,  we used to do a gig at the place called Cadillacs, and, um, we'd go there every Wednesday night.  Here's what we used to have to do.  Every Wednesday night, we had to go to a bar and hang out with people.  Just hang, we didn't have to do, like, we did, like, giveaways and stuff.  Hey, what's the strangest thing you brought with you, you know?  Kind of empty your pockets out, and, and we'd give out prizes and stuff.  You know, the basic, uh, hack radio music jock thing. 
[02:55:30]  And, uh, and we'd drink, and we would fucking get tanked.  And, um, there would be, uh, uh, booze sponsors.  So, there were these Kahlua girls, and they would show up every week, every Wednesday with us.  It was part of the deal.  They weren't even legal.  Dude, they were not fucking.  As far as drinking age.  Like, drinking age.  They weren't drinking age legal, so.  These girls were like, yeah, 18, 19, somewhere around there.  Maybe their birthday, they were gonna be 18.  Right, right.  Kind of things.  And we got to know them, you know, pretty well. 
[02:56:00]  And, uh, I knew my marriage was through.  Because I hadn't cheated or anything.  I, I, I was a good boy.  I, I was always miserable.  Believe me, if you've heard me talk about my marriage, from, I do.  When I said, I do, I was miserable.  You tell the story, you were crying.  Oh, I was just like.  The night of your wedding.  Just a, a, a fucking Demi Mortier rolling down as I'm staring at the ceiling going, what did I do?  Oh my god, this is the awful.  And where was your wife at the time?  Up, but passed out, I believe, uh, on the floor. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  And I'm going, this is fantastic, welcome to the wonderful world of marriage.  Is that true?  Oh, it's, it's too true, my friend.  You were crying?  You were crying out on the floor?  I was, I was staring at the ceiling.  This was after the wedding?  After the wedding.  This is the honeymoon night.  Oh my god, I'm thinking it's a week before they broke up.  No.  No, this is what's great.  I'm laying in the bed, staring at the ceiling, and I, I guess we had gotten into some kind  of brawl because, you know, whenever the alcohol.  Because that's what you do on your wedding night.  You know, there's a brawl. 
[02:57:00]  So I'm laying there and, and there's this sadness and anger and frustration and, like,  every awful emotion where I'm sitting there staring at the ceiling and I felt like a tear  come out of the corner of my eye and roll down, like, the side of my head into my ear  because I was laying down and I just, out loud, I said, what the fuck did I do?  Like, I, it was just, and of course, I made sure that ended nine years later. 
[02:57:30]  Talk about fucking self-hatred.  Why the fuck did I do that?  Nine years I stayed in that marriage.  But, uh, in, in Massachusetts, that's when I knew it was done because, um, I'd never cheated  or anything like that, and then, uh, one of the Kahlua girls and me still had a little,  you know, friendship, uh, going on and, and I just found myself making out with her.  Behind a banner? 
[02:58:00]  Behind a banner.  I went to look around because it was time to give away another stupid prize and there's  Anthony.  I'm making out with a girl with a mouthful of braces.  She weighed about 85 pounds and looked about 14 years old.  And, and right then I was like, this marriage is done.  And then, and then we were invited to go skinny dipping with them, with them all.  We wanted us to all go, all me and Opie, we were the biggest, skinny dipping with the  three Kahlua girls.  We were the biggest nerds, like, cause they were just carefree, free spirits. 
[02:58:30]  Like guys, uh, you know, after the bar closes, we're going to all go skinny dipping.  You want to join us?  It was just me and you and three or four of these girls.  And, uh, you know, I've already, you know, hooked up with one of them, but you don't want  to go home soaking wet.  Yeah.  How do you explain you were fucking, oh, you should have seen what happened.  We did a promotion.  It was a dunk tank thing.  Very impromptu.  We didn't advertise it.  And once you're skinny dipping, that's a little more than just kissing. 
[02:59:00]  All I ever did was make out with that chick.  Yeah.  Uh, because I was married and I wasn't going to, you know, go.  The distance.  But if we went skinny dipping, it would have been over.  That girl was getting fucked.  But we were sitting there like.  Whether she liked it or not.  We were sitting there like, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Gotta go home.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh.  But yeah, that was it.  After that, it was just a matter of time.  You just knew, right?  It was just a matter of time. 
[02:59:30]  Five more years.  What a couple of nice guys, though.  You guys didn't cheat or do anything bad.  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.  And you look back at, especially, I look back at the marriage having ended, so I wasted that.  Yeah.  I should have fucking come home and just put, I should have woke her up by putting my pussy  smelling cock right under her nose.  Hey, how you doing?  It's your turn to cry.  Yeah, here you go.  All right, well, oh boy, hotline ringing. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, who's that?  Oh, God knows.  Look at this big.  We're waiting, we're waiting.  Who is this?  What?  Anthony's ex?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, sure.  It's Keith.  What's up, Keith?  No, I was just thinking with that story, Anthony could have just put his wet underwear in the  glove compartment of his car.  Ooh.  Put it under the seat.  I'm sorry, Allison.  I'm sorry, Allison.  Ooh.  It's about you, Allison.  All right.  That's all.  Hi, Keith. 
[03:00:30]  Hi, sweetie.  Well, we've gone down this road already, Peter.  Peter from Massachusetts.  Peter.  Hey, good morning.  Very good.  That's your reference.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Why the fuck did you marry this crazy bitch?  Are you fucked up too or what?  No.  The fact was I was at a part of my life where I felt that I was still a kid.  Like, I wasn't...  Whenever I would go hang out anywhere, it was like, I'm a kid.  What the fuck am I doing? 
[03:01:00]  I'm like getting older and I'm a kid.  So I had to do something to catapult myself into adulthood.  And marriage was one of those things.  How long...  Wait.  How long have you been divorced?  Officially.  2000.  99.  2000.  2002.  Officially, paperwork-wise, but out of the house in 2000.  So you got married in 93.  99 out of the house.  Holy shit.  They got married in 90.  Oh, 90.  Wow.  Yeah.  Nine years of wedded bliss. 
[03:01:30]  What's that?  Were you getting any pussy before you got married?  Yeah, it wasn't like I fucking married the first girl I had sex with, you ass.  I was a funny guy, so I got girls.  Yeah.  He's a big dick.  I didn't need the Brad Pitt looks.  I have a fucking Italian tuna can cock and I'm funny.  Do you have a tuna can cock?  Dude.  Oh, I know.  It's my wit to my smell.  Oh, you're fucking vicious. 
[03:02:00]  I love it.  Big, juicy, delicious treat he has.  Anthony's a very private person, but I do know for a fact that he is a huge hog.  Anthony is fucking all cock, I guarantee it.  Look.  It got some oohs and ahs.  It got some oohs and ahs, yes.  That's another instance where I knew the marriage was over.  When I was showing my cock to a bunch of girls that just left a strip club in exchange to see their pussies. 
[03:02:30]  A little show and tell.  A little show and tell outside of the-  A little bachelorette party.  Outside the bar.  There was a bunch of bars in the complex.  Outside Red Square.  Yeah.  Right?  Yep.  It was a rock club and then the next door was like Chippendales and then next to that was a country bar.  They had a mall of bars.  And we were leaving-  Remember the Black Strip Club for girls?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They had a country bar, sports bar, rock club.  All in one complex.  A white strip club for the whiteys and a black strip club for the black girls. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, we came out of doing another appearance.  We're hammered off our asses.  And we hear, show us your cock.  Show us your cock.  And we're like, show us your car?  Car.  What the fuck do these girls want to see our car?  Your cock.  Show us your fucking cocks.  And they're all drunk, hammered.  Just got out of a strip show.  A Chippendales type show.  So they're all fucking horned up.  So me and Hope kind of walk into our cars.  And then we look at each other like idiots.  And it's that moment where it's like, let's just show our fucking cocks. 
[03:03:30]  All just hammered.  Goddamn alcohol.  So where it goes, you want to see it?  You want to see it?  You want to see it?  So he takes the girls behind the, it was like some kind of motorhome.  Like an RV or something.  And I'm in the front of this RV, you know, in front of it, I should say.  There was one hot girl there.  And all pigs.  And all I cared about was seeing the hot girl.  Like the girl getting married had a massive bunt.  Big bunt, big fat.  Yeah, because then you went in the woods with her.  Well, because I wanted to show her, do the show and tell. 
[03:04:00]  No, you did the show and tell behind the RV.  Yeah.  And then it was time for her to show.  And she just like undid her panties or something.  And this whole mess.  Mass of mess just fell out.  And I was all pissed.  And then I went into the van where the hot chick was and demanded she show me her pussy.  Did you?  So you saw my cock.  Yeah.  Well, I was in the front of the RV.  Oh, God.  And we were really just pigs.  And Ann goes, I'll show you. 
[03:04:30]  I'll show you.  Like all like worked up.  He goes to the back of the RV and there's like three or four fatties around him in a circle.  And all I hear, I've told this story many times.  It's the truth.  All I hear is, oh, wow.  It was in perfect.  The perfect time where it doesn't even resemble that you're getting worked up.  But it looks like that's how it is normally.  Thick and full and heavy.  Right, right.  But not starting to twitch or head north.  It's that perfect time where it's just like, look at it. 
[03:05:00]  Mighty.  So, right.  Then the story ends.  They were done with Ann.  And now they come marching toward me.  I'm in front of the RV.  Your turn.  You're up.  I went into panic mode.  I was like sporting maybe an acorn.  Wait, did your cock like a shame shriveled?  Oh, what happened now?  And I was like, I don't know.  We somehow changed the subject.  So, oh, backed out.  And then the other girls go, oh, well, then I'm not showing anything.  And I'm like, I just fucking showed.  You better fucking show. 
[03:05:30]  But the reason I backed out because I knew 10, 12 years later, you know, you would know that I wasn't sporting that day.  I knew it was probably just, you know, show and tell nerves.  Was your dick so soft that it was standing straight out?  Sometimes your dick is so not hard that it's not even hanging.  It's like there's not even any blood in it.  You have no shaft.  It goes pubis head.  Like a safe fell on it.  Are you talking about a spy versus spy bomb? 
[03:06:00]  And you're wondering how it can get that small.  All right.  You don't have the biggest cock in the world.  But my God, how did it get so small?  The funniest description I ever heard was some comic said it looked like a stack of dimes.  That's fucking brilliant.  Stack of dimes.  Those days, yeah, you just, you just, I knew that it was over.  When you start pulling shenanigans like that, fuck it. 
[03:06:30]  Walk away.  That's what I should have done, too.  God, I knew in Boston, too.  Everyone did but me.  And then you wonder.  Remember the fucking appearances?  I'm talking about myself.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, that I was done or?  Well, my relationship.  And then it took years.  It's like years.  You sit back and go, why the fuck did it take that long?  Remember going to some of these concerts that AF used to put on?  And we'd hang out and like Aerosmith's playing or something.  And it was just the wife getting out of hand. 
[03:07:00]  And remember the salespeople and Brucey Mittman would be looking over going, well, you certainly  seem to have your hands full tonight, Anthony.  I remember one time.  Jesus Christ, man.  I don't know what the gig was, but ruining my fucking night.  But you begged her to keep it under control because I guess there were some bigwigs in  town or.  Yeah.  I forgot what it was, but we were at some gig, but it was important that we had our wits  about us.  I think we were like renegotiating a contract or something. 
[03:07:30]  I don't know what it was.  Something big.  And you pulled her aside like, look, tonight's not the night to get sloppy.  Please just do me a favor and just keep it under control.  Fast forward a few hours and she was passed out at the foot of the bar.  Remember that?  Yep.  Under like people's feet and stuff.  Oh, my God.  Right.  Under the bar stools.  And our general manager's just like, that's when he said, oh, your hands fall.  I'm just like.  Were you embarrassed?  Mortified?  Oh, mortified.  Completely embarrassed.  But I was such a pussy whipped douchebag. 
[03:08:00]  Anytime she would go like, you know, I got a gig or I got like, you know, a meeting or  a concert that we're doing and stuff.  Oh, I'm going.  I'm going.  Surprised I was able to get out of the house to do the Chevy's things.  Right.  I think it was because she had to work the next day or something.  I don't know.  Did you ever not want her to come?  The Cadillac.  All the time.  I never wanted her to come to one fucking gig that we did.  Never.  It was just a fucking chore. 
[03:08:30]  There was one time, and this was before I even did radio, hanging out at Off-Broadway  and hanging out with all the people we knew there and shit.  You know, remember Randy and all those guys that used to hang out and just drink.  And she, I go, I got to go.  I got to get up for work.  I got to go home.  It's like 10 o'clock.  And I'm the only one with a vehicle.  I go, come on.  Let's go.  No.  I'm staying.  I go, you stay.  You know something?  Fine.  I'm going home. 
[03:09:00]  So I get in the van.  I start up.  I start getting ready to drive home.  I'm going to start playing this out in my head.  I go, I'm going to get home.  I'm going to lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for her to get the fuck home.  So I'm not going to sleep anyway.  So she's fucking getting home.  I shut the door.  I walked in.  She's in mid-babble about something.  I grabbed her, put her over my shoulder, and just walked out the fucking door and threw  her in the van to applause.  And the bar just went, yeah, like get the fuck out of here. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, what a chore every minute was.  You were in a codependent alcoholic relationship.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  Codependency.  You could have used Alarone.  I could have gotten a better drunk, though.  You know?  I don't mind a drunk occasionally, but fuck.  Not that one.  Not a meanie drunk.  I like nice drunks.  There are so many stories to tell.  Oh.  Just new, though. 
[03:10:00]  Tell me how to, like, drag her mom around.  Oh, mom had to come everywhere, too.  And she liked to drink just as much.  I want.  If not more.  That's the I want to go home stories.  I want to go home.  But we're doing stuff where it's like, I have to be here.  This is a fucking.  I want to go home.  I'm tired, and I have to get up for work tomorrow.  I want to go home.  Ah, banana.  God bless Judy.  She's no longer with us. 
[03:10:30]  But, man, when the two of them got together.  Oh.  Mom wants to go home.  I know, but we got to.  I want to go home.  All right.  You want to take her, would you?  All right.  Put her in the truck.  Yeah.  And I would leave gigs to drive his freaking mother-in-law home and then come back to the gig.  And it wasn't like it was around the corner.  Like, he lived in Ashland.  This is a reference for Boston, obviously.  And the gigs were in downtown Boston.  Yeah, Boston.  So, it wasn't like a quick ride. 
[03:11:00]  It's at least an hour and a half both ways if you're speeding and, you know.  So, you'd have to leave like, what, eight and come back by like 930 or something?  Whatever it was.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Did you want to choke her?  Every day.  Selfish old cunt.  Every day I wanted to choke.  It was just like every day something.  We were rocking, man, with our radio show.  And Aunt's ex and her mother would just sit around drinking waiting for Aunt to come home.  Waiting for me to come to the house to pick her up.  She lived a mile away from us. 
[03:11:30]  A mile away.  And then there were times I would call Aunt.  And I'm like, why aren't you home yet?  And you had to like sit through soap operas and stuff.  Oh, because, yeah, we ought to say they would tape General Hospital, Days of Our Lives, and Friends.  What are you going to play today?  And I would have to sit there and watch it.  Oh, you're playing the mother-in-law at 11 today.  Great.  Today at 11, you'll hear this.  Three rights, make a left.  That's why I don't make a left handstands because I have three rights.  But Aunt would go to the house. 
[03:12:00]  They'd be hammered.  And then Aunt would have to sit through one or two soap operas and socialize.  Two hours of soap operas and a half hour of Friends.  So two and a half hours after I'm done with the show at 7 o'clock, I would have to sit there.  And the first thing I did was go right up to Judy's fridge, get the giantest glass, the humongoid glass I could find.  Load a little ice in there.  And arrr, arrr, the captain is being parred. 
[03:12:30]  Big captain and coax.  He makes everything good.  Drinking them down.  I had to fucking be annihilated.  Before I was in radio, we used to have to go up there because she lived.  It was, I swear, she lived.  It was 20 minutes from the radio station that I wound up working at.  I never knew I was getting into radio.  I was in air conditioning.  But I'd have to drive up there for holidays and stuff.  And every time I went up.  Anthony, could you please put the automatic garage door opener up?  Yeah, I'm just on Christmas vacation here. 
[03:13:00]  And I do, like, work with fucking tools and stuff my whole time.  And, yeah, I'll do it.  Could you fix my air conditioning unit?  It seems to be blowing out cold.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just taking vacation from air conditioning and heating.  Why don't I just do some of that during my fucking Thanksgiving vacation?  I'll do that.  That's a fun, fun thing.  So every time we left, Jennifer would be crying because she's leaving her mom.  Very emotional.  And she'd go, is there, like, any chance you would think about moving up here? 
[03:13:30]  Because I miss her so much when we leave.  I go, there is no fucking situation ever where I would move up to Massachusetts.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  On WAAF, the only station that really rocks.  And Opie told me, you know, it's like, hey, here's a gig.  Whereabouts is that station?  Oh, it's here.  Do you know where Ashland is? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, that's right next to the fire.  Oh, my God, I'm moving up to my mother-in-law's fucking town.  The radio station couldn't have been more than five miles from his mother-in-law's.  We were on the air at, like, three.  And I used to watch Days of Our Lives, which I think started at two.  It was one of those things.  Yeah, you're right there.  All right.  What a nightmare, Dr. Phil.  Well, at 11 o'clock, we go down memory lane.  We'll tell the mother-in-law's story, all right?  Absolutely.  We'll take a break.  We'll talk about the Paris Hilton thing next. 
[03:14:30]  Short break.  What the hell was that?  That sounded like you tore Velcro.  I thought someone moved a chair.  What was that?  I just started thinking about walking home with all those people.  Yeah, and you scared me.  I got scared.  You got scared again, Jimmy?  What got the scariness out of you?  Because I always say, be a brave boy, be a brave boy.  And I muster up courage.  And it pushes all the scaredness out the back. 
[03:15:00]  The courage, but okay.  There's a lot of people asking if your ex listens.  I have no idea.  I doubt it.  Especially on this end.  She probably hears from people, though.  People probably listen and go, oh.  You think she takes a peek on the other end?  They're talking and, you know, talking about you.  You know.  I don't care.  Whatever.  Listen.  Exactly.  Listen.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Prepare to be wowed.  What knockers. 
[03:15:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow me.  All right, all right, all right.  Paris Hilton.  So what's the deal with this Paris Hilton?  She's a slut.  Yeah.  She's a pig.  She's a whore.  She's a hose bag. 
[03:16:00]  How did we get this?  Some website?  Is this some of the stuff they found in her storage bin?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, there was some kind of storage.  Okay, but how did he buy her storage?  Huh?  Had someone buy her storage stuff.  She didn't pay the bill.  So the guy just confiscated all her stuff and said, all right, fuck you.  Paris claims defendants tried to extort millions of dollars from her in exchange for giving back her stuff,  which allegedly was bought for a measly $2,775 at an auction and then sold to the web site operator for $10 million. 
[03:16:30]  That's an investment, my friend.  If you could spend a couple of grand and then sell it for $10 million, wow.  You know how much shit they probably go through in those storage things when people don't pay?  It's just like, all right, we got this.  We got, ah, pick it up for a couple of hundred bucks.  I could drop it off here and maybe make my money back.  Ah, scrap metal, whatever.  That's like fucking a gold mine. 
[03:17:00]  I left the fucking, I left my stuff in your self-storage in Maryland and I never got it back.  Did you?  Yeah.  Hey, there's someone walking around with Jimmy, you know, Norton memorabilia.  The original, uh, Kango hat.  Now this stuff phases her, though.  It doesn't fuck up her career.  No, what could she possibly be mad at?  We've seen it all already.  This isn't shocking.  Well, one of the videotapes, uh, she was doing some naughty things.  Naughty?  Like this. 
[03:17:30]  Yo, I'm black and I spewed this across all this.  That's awesome.  All right.  I do what?  There, she's implying black people steal things.  She goes, yo, I'm black and I'm stealing what?  I'm stealing what?  It's hard to hear, unfortunately.  She was at a club, obviously.  Always.  Mm-hmm.  Loud clubs.  I don't want to do it.  Oh, there you heard it.  I do it.  Paris, you made me. 
[03:18:00]  I'm like, brother, princess.  Ew!  I'm the last star.  I have had to start.  I'm a little jappy Jew.  I'm a little jappy Jew.  Who was she talking about?  Sounds like she said Ashley Starr.  Ashley Starr, one of her little play friends.  If I spent $10 million on stuff and that's the best I got, I would eat the videotape. 
[03:18:30]  I would eat it.  You get more out of it nutritionally than you would as entertainment.  All you're doing is fast forward and going, please be a cock near her mouth soon.  Yeah, that is a perfect example of how people just fuck her for her looks and there's nothing  else there.  There's nothing between the ears.  And they fuck her for looks that they feel are so good that it transcends having to listen 
[03:19:00]  to the likes of that.  All right.  What is this glass?  About this blueberry tree.  I love it.  I love the round.  I love the little glass hall.  I got fucked in the butt for coke. 
[03:19:30]  I got what?  I got fucked in the butt for coke.  She makes up some funny song lines, though.  I'll give her that.  They're talking about a black whore and she loves to rock.  We are family playing in the background, so I guess she's making up her own words.  Yeah.  I'm a black whore.  And I love the rock.  I'm a little black whore.  I got fucked in the butt for coke.  Oh, my God. 
[03:20:00]  Wow, they're fucked up.  They are hammered.  They're hammered. 
[03:20:30]  Nice.  Show us your cock.  Show us your cock.  You can see that singing talent early on, though.  Yeah, definitely.  It's really good.  He was trying to get his mug in the camera.  It's awful.  It's awful.  It's awful.  They just party and are, like, happy to just be them and whatever that is.  Whatever it is, sure.  Just whores.  There's nothing better than when one of them overdoses. 
[03:21:00]  Nothing.  When they pull one of them out of the back of a car frozen with foam matted around their mouth,  I couldn't be happier.  She's dying on me, Lance.  I couldn't be happier.  This one's pretty interesting.  I'm a nigga, and I'm checking my daughter asses.  That was cool.  Regular Kramer.  Yeah.  That's good.  Like, I'm a nigger, and I wife.  Something, something, something. 
[03:21:30]  I don't know.  She's cool.  I don't know.  Love says death is me.  They're trying to say death is me.  They are death rich.  They're all broken, ugly, and poor.  Just making fun of broke, ugly, and poor people, as they're rich, and hot, and drunk.  That is so fucking funny.  There's zero substance to these people. 
[03:22:00]  Zero.  What do they say about these bitches?  Desperate.  We are desperate.  He's in love with me.  I'm the best, ugly Jewish bitch.  A what, Jew?  I could listen to this all day.  She is great.  Maybe we can get her to cut it a bit cleaner.  Like, ask her to redo it.  Yeah, let's hear it better.  Trying to come up with lyrics.  Give her some more fucking Cristal.  They're just horrific. 
[03:22:30]  They can't come up with good lyrics.  It doesn't matter, though.  As long as you're throwing in Jew, and...  They still can't figure out what we are, and they can't come up with it.  Yeah, we are...  Badass.  We hate ugly Jewish bitch.  Is that what you do?  Apparently, it seems to me.  Anyway, not apparently.  It seems.  Maybe they're looking around the room, kind of goofing on people that they know or are acquainted  with.  Yeah.  That they know are jealous of them because they're beautiful, young, and rich, and... 
[03:23:00]  And coked up.  And guys are after them.  Is it before she's famous?  I don't think so.  Right around the same time.  Butcher, what do you got?  What were you there?  They're at a...  Do you fuck her?  They're at a New Year's Eve party, and they're just looking around, and there's this group  of girls in the corner, and they keep staring at them.  Oh, okay.  So they're just singing drunkenly about the chicks or whatever.  What year, sweetie?  I don't even know. 
[03:23:30]  It didn't say what year it was.  I love that.  The year was 1999.  What year, sweetie?  Jesus.  What are they saying about these bitches?  Desperate!  We are bad friends!  He's in love with me.  I'm the bad, ugly Jewish bitch.  I am the bullpen.  They just can't come over.  Oh, wow.  All right.  More of that to come.  She's an anti-Semite. 
[03:24:00]  I think that could hurt her career.  No one seems to care what she does, though.  Nah.  She could just fucking blurt out nigger, kike, fat Jew bitch.  It doesn't matter.  She's just a cocksucker.  I know.  No one goes, I'm outraged that Paris was saying that.  Look at this tape.  She's sucking the cock.  She's taking the dick.  She's loving life.  We have a sucks to be you story.  Oh.  This is so a sucks to be you story.  It's not Unlucky Lottery.  A lot of people get confused with Unlucky Lottery and Sucks to be You. 
[03:24:30]  No, this is all about sucks to be you.  All right.  Are you ready for this one?  Mm-hmm.  The rape victim did not want to talk as she left jail.  Police say on Saturday afternoon, the 21-year-old college student was raped as she was leaving  the Gasparilla Parade near downtown Tampa.  That's not the sucks to be you part, by the way.  That she was raped?  That's not the sucks to be you part.  That she had to go to that Gasparilla Parade?  That's not the sucks to be you part.  Noon, the 21-year-old college student was raped as she was leaving the Gasparilla Parade 
[03:25:00]  near downtown Tampa.  The victim called police for help and they took her to a clinic where she was prescribed  the morning after pill.  She took one of those pills and was then arrested after officers found out she had an outstanding  warrant for failure to appear that related to a grand theft charge she got when she was  17 years old.  Oh, jeez.  Cut the girls some slack.  Are you kidding me?  She gets raped and these Florida hicks arrest her. 
[03:25:30]  You could write her out a fucking desk appearance ticket.  Yeah.  Wow, that really is not necessary.  That is such a sucks to be you.  And there's more.  Yeah?  Do they cover more?  How do you know?  Yes.  I know the story.  Oh, you do?  I raped her.  Of course you did.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  We have some new shame on you, by the way. 
[03:26:00]  Stupid Arnold Diaz went after a chimney sweeper.  What?  Are you kidding?  Maybe we can end the show with this after we get past the second part of this story.  Then, while in jail, her mom says she was victimized again when a nurse supervisor would not let her take the second morning after pill the next day.  The supervisor said that the morning after pill was against her, the supervisor's religion, and refused to dispense it. 
[03:26:30]  Without your participation here, she would not be getting out.  I'm convinced of that.  And I want to thank each and every one of you.  Tampa police say they now regret arresting the rape victim.  The attorney says the pre-med college student thought she had taken care of that old grand theft charge and was surprised it was still outstanding.  Poor girl.  The nurse wouldn't give her the pill.  No.  Leave it on the counter then.  Because of her own beliefs, if it's legal to dispense, that fucking bitch should be fired. 
[03:27:00]  Pharmacists don't have to.  They don't have to give you certain things if it's against their...  If it's against their...  That is re-goddamn-diculous.  I know.  That's fucking ridiculous.  Then fire them and hire somebody that dispenses everything that's legal in this country.  They arrest a rape victim.  Not for a felony, but for something stupid like that.  Like a theft charge years ago.  Jesus Christ.  Grand theft, right?  Isn't that with a weapon?  When she was 17.  I'm trying to think.  Grand theft.  Grand theft auto.  No, I don't have a weapon when I'm stealing cars. 
[03:27:30]  You just pull them out, throw them down, and then sometimes they even try to get back in.  Yeah.  That pisses me off.  Oh, man.  Do I shoot them in the back of the head at that point?  I cannot stand when you pull someone out of the car, and you hop in the car, and before  you drive off, they open the door and throw you out.  Yeah.  Oh, I will just grab another car and tail him all day.  Next thing you know...  You gotta kill him.  Next thing you know, it becomes all too real.  Yeah.  You forgot you're in the middle of a mission.  Motherfucker.  I was stealing his car, and he pulls that shit on me.  Are you kidding me? 
[03:28:00]  He's dead.  I was gonna let you live, buddy.  Fucking dead.  Dead.  Yeah, now, dead.  Fuck you.  First I'll beat you senseless, then I'll fucking shoot you.  I get pissed inside.  Yeah.  I forget it's a game.  I'm like, you what?  That's my car.  You're trying to get your car back?  Are you nuts?  You're on your ass in the street?  What happened?  What the fuck?  The fuck is this?  Oh, I make it ugly, too.  It's somebody else playing a game, like, 3,000 miles away, pulling you out of the car.  Hey, what happened?  I make it ugly. 
[03:28:30]  I run them over, back and forth, back and forth, over and over.  I go to a weird place sometimes with that game.  George in New York.  George.  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I'm an officer with the NYPD, and, you know, regarding your, sucks to be you, there is actually  a transit district, you know, precinct at the subway, where if you come in to report  a crime against you, either a lawsuit or whatever, they will run your name and your date of birth  to see if you want it for anything. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, good.  Yeah, sure.  Well, who the fuck is going to go to a police station, then?  Well, yeah, I mean, it depends on what you want to do.  People with clean records.  Yeah.  But, you know, you go from being the victim to being the perp.  Yeah, I mean, especially if it's a rape victim and something stupid like a theft, it's a  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could see if she was in a fender bender and they ran her license and found out she  had been, had a warrant, you know, then that's even extreme to bring her in, you know,  instead of just writing her a ticket or something.  But, wow. 
[03:29:30]  A rape?  Absolutely.  But, I mean, you could be a guy who got robbed in the subway and they go, okay, well, what's  your name and date of birth?  Oh, gee, we have a ticket that you didn't pay for here.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Thank you, George.  No problem, guys.  Thanks for the knowledge.  Everyone, keep their mouth shut.  Another sucks to be you story?  Yeah.  All right.  The folks on Westmont Street may not have known the name of the man who lived in this house,  but they knew what he would not tolerate.  Oh, boy.  What wouldn't he tolerate?  Oh, my God.  Let's guess. 
[03:30:00]  Um.  Ah.  Goldfish in his backside.  Mm.  Could be.  Could be.  That's a good one.  Mm.  They'd burn a cross on his lawn and he wasn't black.  Poor guy.  Poor guy.  What wouldn't he tolerate?  Oh, poor little guy.  Body hair.  The folks on Westmont Street may not have known the name of the man who lived in this house,  but they knew what he would not tolerate.  Pops, whatever you do out in the street or over on that other side of the fence, that's 
[03:30:30]  your business, but you're not going to bring it in this yard.  So when Isaac Singletary saw a drug deal going on in front of his house yesterday evening,  he wanted them gone and took action.  Oh, boy.  The man didn't know, actually, that there were police officers because this man is like  this about the whole neighborhood.  Kids and all.  He do not like people in his yard.  Police are still trying to figure out if the officers told Singletary they were cops.  Right now, they just don't know.  If you have the opportunity to identify yourself, we will identify ourselves, but if you've got  an individual that's got a firearm, then you have to do what you have to do based on 
[03:31:00]  your training and try to protect your life or protect the lives of others.  All right.  Undercover operation going on.  Drug deal.  Guy thinks it's a drug deal going on.  He decides he's going to be a fucking stand-up guy and fight crime by himself because he's a  fucking superhero and goes out.  With a gun.  He went out with a gun?  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's kind of smart because if you go out to face drug dealers without a gun,  you're really stupid. 
[03:31:30]  You're second stupid if you go out to face drug dealers that turn out to be cops and  you have a gun.  That's like second place stupid.  You shouldn't, probably shouldn't go out.  They shot him dead.  He was 80.  80?  He was 80.  Yeah.  Oh, he was feisty, wasn't he?  He was 80.  He was at Y-O.  Oh!  I'm tired of it.  Those meddling kids!  I'm tired of the drug dealing.  I'm going to make a stand. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  After several recent shootings by JSO, many in the community are fed up.  We are tired of what happened in Emerson.  Then it comes down here to the south side.  It's why cops made a special effort to show that Singletary was armed,  showing the tree in his yard hit by bullets from his gun.  But on Westmont Street, emotions are still wrong after a man who had the respect of those  on this street was gunned down doing what they say he always did, protecting his property.  It's like I see him because I look in his eyes. 
[03:32:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I see how his pain, I felt the pain for him.  Gary Evans says his uncle Isaac had grown tired of the drug dealing around his house.  Well, then, stop the fucking drug dealing.  And clean it up.  He would call me.  He would say, yeah.  I'd say, Garrett, yeah.  Some undercover officer was out here today, picking up the boys around here.  He would welcome that.  And those are the very same ones that took his life.  Well, how about the community fucking, you know, does something about the drug problem? 
[03:33:00]  Fuck.  That's just a mix-up.  I mean, the old guy was doing the right thing, and the cops did the right thing.  It's like a guy comes at you with a gun in that neighborhood.  Well, the old guy kind of taking it into his own hands at 80 years old is a little silly  to tell you the truth.  He should have just fucking stayed in his house.  I like that, though.  He came out with a gun to shoot those vermin.  I'm going to show you a little justice.  Oops.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  Hitting trees blind as a bat.  I know.  He's all old.  Jesus Christ.  A tree was after me. 
[03:33:30]  Opie, there was a story here in Albany.  The father and son were going on a snowmobile trip, and they had all their supplies, which  included 10 ounces of Coke.  They got pulled over for driving erratically.  They got nailed with all the stuff.  They got bailed out the next morning without sleeping.  Got their truck at an impound.  Got on the highway, going the wrong way, and got hit head-on by a tanker truck and killed.  Oh, nice.  Nice.  What happened with the snowmobile?  Cute story.  That was fine.  That was fine.  I love on the episodes of Cops, when you're watching, you see a guy doing like 80, and 
[03:34:00]  he gets pulled over and has just a trunk full of shit.  If you had all that, wouldn't you be Mr. 55?  No.  55 is suspicious.  60.  61.  61.  61.  One.  Set the cruise control.  61.  They drive around like maniacs, get pulled over, and then the cops just know the second  they get out of the car, and they're looking around all shaking, nervous.  You mind if I take a look in the vehicle?  I'm going to have it.  I'm going to have it. 
[03:34:30]  Yes, I do.  Well, then we'll just, I'll stay here.  We'll send somebody for a warrant.  And the warrant is, hiya, hiya, hiya.  And then the dogs are going to come, so you can let me just search it, or you can wait  for the, all right, hiya.  Okay, officer, I'm going to run now and look really stupid, and you're going to chase me  and tackle me about 10 feet down the road, and then I'm going to say, what'd I do?  I didn't do nothing.  And go.  And go.  All right.  Oh, we got lines of the day. 
[03:35:00]  We can do a little more here, no?  I wanted to hear, what did you have?  Shame on you.  And what else?  We also have the rat story that we should talk about, like, yesterday.  Meh.  Meh.  Or Monday.  Meh.  Good old Dan down there in Washington.  I like to call him Dan the man.  Dan the man?  Can I mention that?  He's a huge supporter of the O.P. and Anthony show, and he's in charge of a lot of things  down there.  He's in charge of a lot of studios and equipment and what have you, and he put out a memo to 
[03:35:30]  the entire staff of XM Satellite Radio about a rat problem.  Rat.  At the facility in Washington.  We got a fucking rat in there?  Which was an old printing press?  It was like a printing place, an old magazine-like printing place.  It was back, I don't know, way back.  Yeah.  And the XM bought it.  It's an extremely old building that they gutted.  They're very proud of it, too.  And renovated.  First time we went there, they were very proud of the fact that it's an old building, and 
[03:36:00]  they incorporated the original architecture inside and out into the office space.  So some of the offices, you'll see cubicles, but you look up, and it's wooden beams and  brick and wood ceilings from the roof.  It's a very historic building, and they're very proud of it.  Right.  Well, there is a rat down in Washington, besides the rats.  Fucking rats?  Because what happened, and I feel bad for Dan, because I think he's getting in a, I don't  know if he's getting in a bit of trouble, but I know this much, we can't get him on the 
[03:36:30]  show to talk about this, so something's going on.  So Dan writes this email to the entire staff of XM about a rat problem.  They're trying to take care of it, but basically keep your cubicles and your area clean, because  the rats are getting very aggressive, where they're actually going on desks and taking  food that people are leaving out.  It's not just in the walls and stuff.  They are roaming around the facility.  So he writes this huge memo, like, look, we're taking care of the problem, but this is  what you could do to help.  Some rat.  Elo gave two of the rats a show. 
[03:37:00]  Some rat.  Yeah.  Sends the email to the Washington Post.  Ah.  Sends it to the Washington Post, and they wrote an article on Sunday or Monday.  That's what's bad about the fucking emails that go out to everybody in the company.  I don't like that shit.  I hope they find out who sent it to the Washington Post, and they get fired.  Fired.  Even if it's Elo.  No.  Yes.  I don't want Elo to get fired.  Not Elo.  Yes.  Yes.  I say even Elo.  I say no, because it sounds like something Elo would do. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  Be all drunk one night.  Yeah.  Just fucking, hey, Washington Post, we got fucking rats in the place.  Well, this is the article in the Washington Post.  Harry Potter nude?  What?  Look on TV.  What?  Jesus, all day fucking long.  All day long.  Huh?  All day long.  If you hear some scratching noises on XM Radio, it's probably not static, but it might be rats.  The Satellite Radio's district headquarters is so infested. 
[03:38:00]  This was in the Washington Post.  It's so infested with the furry little critters.  Your studios are so polluted.  You can't even put on a little radio show.  The company has gone to the rat eradication equivalent of DEFCON 1.  Wow.  Flush the bombers.  Those of you familiar with DC Rodents know that we're looking at the size of small house  cats.  Aw.  Writes XM Senior Veep Dan.  What?  Same email.  Oh, that's the actual email from, oh, very cool. 
[03:38:30]  In an internal memo sent to employees on Friday.  Now, why do they have all the websites before we get back to the article?  So, website, website, website, website, website, website.  Okay.  Turner goes on, oh, there's his last name.  What a dope.  Turner goes on to describe the gnawing dread.  Currently, we have lost the functionality of Production Room 8 as the rodents have discovered  that the cover on our fiber optics cables makes good nesting material. 
[03:39:00]  How's the holodeck?  Is that okay?  It's all I care about.  Why do they ever use that?  It was nothing but trouble.  Sorry.  There's no rats on the Enterprise.  We all know it.  Oh, okay.  A couple of weeks ago, it was one of the multifunction studios that was taken out of commission.  Tomorrow, it could be a cable to a satellite uplink.  It is that serious.  Ooh.  The Beltway, rat-wise, appears to be on the second floor of the XM building, a beautifully 
[03:39:30]  restored former printing factory on New York Avenue.  Reports, our colleague, Paul Farheek, the crawlspace under the raised floors represents  an eight-lane superhighway to anywhere the rats want to go, writes Turner.  The broadcaster has summoned Orkin, according to spokesman Chance Patterson.  The Orkin man?  And has enlisted the building's 600 employees in immediate and very aggressive eradication  measures.  That means no food and drink in the studios, not even coffee. 
[03:40:00]  Eek!  The reporter writes.  And all those magazines, posters, and other junk must be tossed because rats like to use  them to build nests.  So what they need is some kind of final solution for these rats.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  No shock and awe here.  Turner's ready for a long siege.  Eventually, they'll get the building back, he concludes his memo.  But we ain't done with it yet.  I think once there's that many in there, it's really hard.  If you get right when a little family moves in or something and they go, hey, this is 
[03:40:30]  nice.  But if it gets infested to that point, how do you know?  If you don't kill every single one and you have one male and one female left, in months,  you will again have a shitload of fucking rats.  Once you start saying we have to take out albums and magazines because they leave their  good nesting material.  You've got to think that you can pretty much see these things running around.  Why are they nesting?  If you're looking closer.  To make more little rats.  Elo's going to doze off at his desk and they're going to be fixing them sleeping in his awful 
[03:41:00]  hairdo.  And no one will notice?  No.  There's a great book.  They'll just think it's Elo's hair?  Yeah.  There's a great book I've started three times called Rats.  It's amazing.  They say if you live in New York, at any given moment, you're about 10 feet away from rats.  Not only rats, but they're fucking right now.  10 feet away from us.  They say anywhere in New York, you're within 10 feet of rats fucking.  Sometimes they're right under the sidewalk in little tunnels and stuff.  Right behind the wall behind you, Jimmy, possibly. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  And it is true.  They do come up from toilet bowls.  They do swim every once in a while.  No.  They come through the piping.  That sounds like urban legend.  Well, you better look it up.  No, it has happened.  I can see that book going in the toilet and hanging out in there.  It's in the book.  How do they come up through the pipes?  I don't know.  They get into the system.  That's like fucking full of water.  They get into the system somehow.  They can eat through anything.  We're little.  And they hold their little breath.  They hold their little breath.  Oh, little rats, little teeth. 
[03:42:00]  I couldn't see them wearing scuba gear, those teeth on the regulator.  Cut right through.  This book also talks about how rats cause a lot of fires.  Because they chew through all the wiring.  They chew through all the wiring and cause fires all the time.  I think it's funny that they call like mafia fires Jewish lightning.  Yeah, a little Jewish lightning.  Makes me laugh.  Wow.  Big rat problem.  Ugh.  As long as we're on the air, I could give a shit. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, let's get it.  Dan and me.  Dan?  Yes.  Hey.  Go ahead, Dan.  See, you're on the air.  Yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Rat got your tongue.  Ah, rah, rah, rah.  If they end up killing these rats with poison or whatever, they end up dying inside the walls  or the floors.  They're going to smell really bad.  Yep.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a major undertaking.  How do you get them out?  You have to just send the guy under there with a stick and tell him to poke them. 
[03:43:00]  The Pied Piper.  You play a tune and they follow you.  Huh?  They have metal traps that you have to kind of bait them and catch them alive and then  take them outdoors and kill them or whatever.  Dude, this rat book also talks about those metal traps and they come down on the little  rat's leg and guess what the rat does?  Yells for help.  Chews his leg right off to live.  And he's a fine three-legged rat.  Doesn't even bother him.  That doesn't bother him.  He'll gnaw his own leg off just to get free.  He marries a little beetle rat with a little beetle haircut.  Josh, sometimes... 
[03:43:30]  Very good.  Good luck, guys.  All right, here you go, Josh.  Tell him, Josh.  Tell him.  My dad's got this great picture from when he was a kid.  One day he was taking a shit and a rat came up through the toilet at him.  He's got a picture of it.  Maybe he shit the rat out, my friend.  Yeah, there you go.  Maybe the rat was in the toilet.  Maybe he was hanging out with Richard Gere.  Hiding under the brim.  The brim?  The brim.  Hanging on.  If I saw a rat come through my toilet, I would probably be bothered by it. 
[03:44:00]  It would be over.  I'm happy I got mice because they say if you have mice, you don't have rats.  I'd be in a straitjacket.  Did you ever read American Psycho, the book?  No.  Fuck that movie.  Much worse than the movie.  I love the movie for what it is.  Sure.  But I hear the book is...  There's a scene in the book where Patrick...  Patrick Bateman, to me, didn't do anything ironically.  He was a sociopath.  Yeah.  Like a real psychopath.  And in the book, there's one thing called Rat.  It's one of the chapters where he has two hookers.  He kind of tortures them with car batteries and shit and burns their nipples off and fucking... 
[03:44:30]  He's a monster.  It might even be one of his ex-girlfriends.  But he drills through her face with a fucking...  Like a drill.  And he drills her teeth out.  And he fucks her mouth a little bit and then maces her.  And then he fucking has a habit trail with a hungry rat in it.  And he puts the fucking habit trail up to her pussy.  And he can't get it in, so he pours a little hydrochloric acid around her pussy to make the lips a little looser. 
[03:45:00]  And he jams the habit trail in.  Oh my god.  And he somehow puts cheese on the end of the fucking habit trail and he lets a rat go.  So the rat fucking goes to the end of the habit trail and the cheese brings it inside of her.  And then he yanks the habit trail out.  So then the rat is stuck inside of her.  Oh my god.  And he chainsaws her in half.  He's the fucking great...  That's why I never saw the movie.  I will not see the movie because...  Oh, that is brutal.  You cannot top that.  Wow.  Rats. 
[03:45:30]  Rats.  The torture he does.  Because when he fucking, like, when he takes a drill and just drills through their mouth and drills their teeth out, he's just a goose.  Booch from Jersey.  Opie, I've attached a link to a Seattle government site which deals with flushing rats if they are in your toilet.  Flushing rats.  And that is true.  Stephanie from Dallas.  Rats will kill mice.  So if you have mice, there aren't any rats around.  I don't believe that, though. 
[03:46:00]  I think that they just learned how to get along.  Oh, right.  Here's Chuck from Wyoming.  Chuck?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Morning, Chuck.  Yeah, rats can come up through the sewer pipes any time because there's not water constantly in the sewer pipes.  It's just in the toilet bowl.  And when you flush it, that's when the water goes down there.  So, you know, they don't have to swim or hold their breath like you all think.  They've got to get through the trap.  There's like a trap that's built into your toilet.  I would think more like the older toilets possibly, right? 
[03:46:30]  Maybe the kind with the pull chain.  We could put a rat behind it.  Oh, my brother coming out more than just cheesing his hand.  What, Chuck?  If a rat can get his nose in a hole, he'll get through that hole.  Yeah.  So no matter, you know, they're twisty little fuckers.  I wonder if anybody next time is seeing the rats running around.  I'm sure they are, right?  I guess they're in lockdown down there.  There's not really a lot of talk about it.  We can't get anyone on the phone.  They got rats in Jersey? 
[03:47:00]  Maybe.  Nice work, Ricky Tiki Tavi.  Hey, let's go to Iowa.  It's been a while.  Yeah, it has.  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, Iowa.  Hey, listen.  My uncle works for a company in Chicago that gets rid of like rodent problems in big factories  and stuff like that.  They now do things where they have pellets that have kind of sensors that shows where  the big nests are and where all the rats are.  Then they blast them with sound waves.  You know, they obviously have a weekend or a time where no one's in the building, then 
[03:47:30]  they blast them with sound waves to get them out of the building and then take measures  to, you know, block up holes or other things that are where they got in to begin with.  Oh, all right.  So you think they're going to use sound waves down there?  I have no idea what they're going to do down there, but that's the way they can do it.  They track to where the main nests are and then they just blast them with sound waves.  So as I think Jimmy was saying, they don't die on the walls.  They get them out of the building.  Are there main nests like big collecting areas where they hang out?  Yeah, because that's where a lot of them, there's like big food stores.  This is where I've heard where they have like most of the food. 
[03:48:00]  And so they all kind of, there's a main area where they go in and out.  And especially with big food plants, they can't have rats dying in the walls.  You have to find a way to get them out.  And with these tracking pellets, they find the main areas.  And then, like I said, they get them out.  What's a tracking pulse?  Pellet?  It's like a pellet.  It's like a food pellet.  Oh, they eat it and you can pick it up on a machine.  Some type of machine.  Wow, man.  Anyway. 
[03:48:30]  Science.  All right.  They should just blast Tyra's XM show through the fucking floors.  That'll get them out.  A bunch of fat rats waddling out trying to explain themselves.  Let's go to George in Colorado.  George.  Yeah, hey, boys.  Hey, my father's an exterminator and I'm an exterminator.  And there are a lot of poisons they can give these rats.  That the rats will die inside the wall, but you'll never smell it.  Just the way the rat dissolves, you don't even know it's there.  Because we use it with mice and rats all the time.  Is it that shit that like pretty much turns into liquid? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, well, yeah, but it dries them out and it dries up all their blood because that's  what generates the smell.  It's as if their blood and whatnot turns into, and their body turns into a liquid.  It just kind of dries them away.  Dries them out.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  Like mummifies them.  Oh, we got a mummy rat.  We got one of our buddies on the line.  Thank you, sir.  All the way from Washington, it's Jaime.  Jaime.  Jaime, what's up?  What's up, Jaime? 
[03:49:30]  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  They got rats down there?  Hell yeah, we got rats.  They're back for what they own, man.  They used to live there when the building was abandoned.  They just came back for what they own.  They came back for what's theirs.  The rats are back.  Have you seen any?  Have I seen any?  No, I've been on the road for the last three weeks, so I haven't, but I used to see them  back in 2000.  We used to have them, and we'd be working in the studio, and the rat would just come by,  just go by you with some food or something in their mouth.  But they're big fuckers, I'll tell you that much. 
[03:50:00]  They're what?  Oh, yeah.  They're big?  Jaime, it's kind of hard to hear you.  You said they're big?  Yeah, pretty huge.  I think we killed one that was about 35 inches one time.  No.  Yeah.  Nose to tail, maybe.  Nose to tail?  Exactly.  That's like three feet long, right?  That's like this.  That's three feet, right?  That's bigger than that.  That's a pony.  Bigger than that.  Yeah.  That's a pony.  You killed a fucking raccoon. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we had one of our production guys was mounting the rat as his transport within the facility.  A bitch was big.  There's one person happy about the rat problem.  When there aren't many people around, it keeps Bob Edwards from starving to death.  That's how they ought to just let Bob sleep under there for a little while.  Just biting into rats and sucking their blood out.  Yeah, a bunch of dried rat carcasses.  By the way, rats are good for the stock.  Matt from New York.  Oddly enough, XM up today, despite the rat problem. 
[03:51:00]  There you go.  27 cents.  I say let the rats roam free.  Rats.  Good.  So how bad is the problem?  What's the inside scoop here?  Are they talking about hundreds?  I mean, what's up?  You know what?  The Orkin man came, like you guys said earlier, and we checked.  There's 30-plus traps all over the floor, and they got all kinds of chemicals going down there.  The biggest fear, you know, the cable, as much as it sounds like a joke, but it's Deadline 2 Studios. 
[03:51:30]  So every day they check for dead rats.  I can probably get you guys an update in a couple of days if they found any, because the guys that used to work for me are the ones doing all the checks.  So I guess I can give you guys a rat update every day.  Yeah, give us a rat update.  Let's get some pictures.  And don't let them squash this bit.  We want to see how many rats are killed overnight.  All right.  All right, you give us a call tomorrow.  All right, folks.  Thanks, Jaime.  Later.  Cool.  Is it Jaime or Jaime? 
[03:52:00]  Jaime.  It's Jaime.  It's Jaime.  Jaime, actually.  Kevin Straley, you should go, Jaime.  Right.  Because Kevin, he just has like a really...  Whatever happened to Kevin?  I'm sure he's still working there, right?  Straley.  He's still there.  He just doesn't like us, I think.  Unfortunately.  I like Kevin.  He likes me.  We haven't talked to him in years.  We email all the time here.  Years.  No, you don't.  We send each other fucking cockpictures.  You know what?  Before I start the rumors, he's a very nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  I would just assume he's very busy, and that's why we haven't talked to him in at least two 
[03:52:30]  years.  Yeah.  But he had a weird way of speaking.  He would go, well, today.  So you'd always try to get him to say words with an A-Y at the end.  Yeah, yeah.  No, you tried.  I did, yes.  I succeeded.  And we would just laugh.  What's after April?  A-may.  My.  We're thinking maybe this May.  We're thinking March.  Nah.  April.  No.  May.  Works.  Yes.  Rats live in sewers and can follow the food in pipes up to your toilet. 
[03:53:00]  Ew.  Keep your kitchen sink, rinse clean, and use garbage disposals as little as possible.  Rinse out your kitchen sink once or twice a month.  Use one cup of bleach and rinse with boiling water.  Never throw grease down the drain.  Keep your toilet lid down when not in use.  If you find a rat in your toilet, flush it.  You think?  Flush it.  What are you supposed to do, feed it?  Watch him spin around trying to swim.  Squirt a little dishwashing liquid under the lid into the bowl. 
[03:53:30]  Wait a couple of minutes, then flush.  That's from a Seattle newspaper.  Will that lube him up or something?  Or make his eyes burn so he can't swim out?  You're killing him.  Ow, my eyes are burning.  Chris in South Carolina.  Hello, rat eyes.  Chris?  Hey there, Chris.  Ask Giroc what time you have to be out today so you can play the motherlug bit.  I don't know how rats get up in the toilet, but I know down south we have a problem with  snakes getting up in the toilet all the time.  What?  What, Chris?  I don't know how rats get up in the toilet, but I know we have trouble down south with 
[03:54:00]  snakes getting in the toilet all the time.  Snakes.  Snakes.  Oof.  I was going to say when I put a filter, but you can't shit through it.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  All right.  How come it's never just wads of cash coming up through your toilet?  It's always something creepy you don't want in there when you're shitting with your fucking  balls dangling down into it.  You might just feel rat whiskers on your fucking tank.  Oh.  Because you hadn't washed and it's all cheesy down there.  He thinks it's Gouda.  So it's nibbling on your yam bag.  He takes a rat bite out of your scrotum on your balls, plumps in the bowl. 
[03:54:30]  And you get a fucking rifle through your own shit to pick out your ball and shove it back  in there.  You get infected.  It's got fucking rat hair on it.  I mean, I'm just saying.  Worse, you just flush because your instinct is to flush the rat.  And you watch your ball just go in circles and gone.  The last thing you see is the rat sink his teeth into it because it looks like an onion.  Your fucking soft grape ball.  His fucking sharp rat teeth are eating what was supposed to spawn a new generation. 
[03:55:00]  We go to the hospital and explain how a rat bit your ball and it fell out of the bag and  then he took it with him.  Why was it attached to the vein in the thing?  We don't know.  We didn't think of it before we started talking.  Dropped out.  He may have nibbled it free.  Can you imagine how busy you'd have to be to not notice a rat chewing on the vein that  attaches your balls to your fucking body?  Reading a good magazine or taking a good shit.  He chewed right through that like a cable.  He's nesting in my bag. 
[03:55:30]  Randy, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hi.  Hey.  Hey, I went to Cleveland one time there to an old factory and there were a big black  guy sitting there on a chair, had an old fishing line with a treble hook on it.  He'd hook on a hunk of cheese.  This was like two in the morning.  Throw it way in there about 100 feet to the end of the factory.  Catch a rat.  Reel it in.  Set the drag.  Flip it into a 55-gallon drum and hit it over the head with a baseball bat and then reload.  Don't talk about rats, sir.  They scared me.  That's a good one. 
[03:56:00]  As a construction guy, there was an electrician and we had a job we were on that had a rat  problem and he would take the wires, hook it up to the 220 and run one cable to one sheet  of metal and the other cable to another sheet of metal and then put the sheets of metal real  close together and then we'd throw some, you know, of our lunch in the space between the  two sheets of metal and just sit there and eat our lunch and wait and a rat would come 
[03:56:30]  out and the second he hit two sheets of metal, now you know what it's like from the electric  shock mousetrap when they just catch some voltage, they get shocked and die.  When 220 volts go through them at like household amperage, they fucking explode.  They short circuit, they become a fucking fuse and short circuit.  It is hysterical and then we're all laugh as we eat our sandwiches and watch rats explode. 
[03:57:00]  How about he just touch one piece of metal?  He'd be fine.  Really?  Yeah, listen, listen.  And he would laugh at us.  I'm scared.  Don't talk about rats anymore.  How much time?  We can do this.  What have we got?  The mother-in-law bit, but we got to get off the air.  Oh, let her rock.  Here is the first runner-up line of the day.  Harry Potter has left his invisibility cloaked behind at Hogwarts.  This is what we're seeing in the faces today.  Now, what would have been funny is if he said, Harry is nude and now you can see Hogwarts.  Hogwarts.  See? 
[03:57:30]  It's all in the wording.  Bravo.  Bodogfight.com sponsors line of the day.  Here's the other runner-up line of the day.  Awful joke.  She's trying to be sad.  Yeah, she's trying to.  Like a regular gal.  Yeah.  But I didn't really get a good look at it.  If you put back up the JonBenet graphic.  I'm what?  Look for a new what?  Where?  That was really funny, Anne.  All right.  Bodogfight.com.  Go to the website.  Check it out. 
[03:58:00]  See what it's all about.  We're going to do line of the day so we can do the mother-in-law bit long form after a quick break.  So here is today's line of the day.  Here comes line of the day, line of the day.  Line of the day, line of the day, line of the day.  Oh, he did get frightened.  You know what that is?  That's courage pushing fear out of your body. 
[03:58:30]  When there's too much courage in there, it pushes the scaredness away.  We're going to be able to do this if we leave?  Okay.  Bye.  Guys, because the phones were really lit for the last ten minutes.  If you have more rat stories, give us a call tomorrow.  We'll continue with that subject and get some new stuff at you tomorrow as well.  Thanks for checking us out.  We greatly appreciate it.
