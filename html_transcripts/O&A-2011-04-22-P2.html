<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with the hosts expressing their frustration with commercial breaks, with Anthony particularly eager to end the show early and start his weekend drinking.  They discuss their intentionally chaotic and disruptive approach to introducing guests, citing past experiences with Clark Peters, Wendell Pierce, and Elton John, claiming this unconventional method actually relaxes their high-profile visitors.

Frequent guest Sam Roberts joins the show, prompting much playful banter about his role and various nicknames bestowed upon him by the hosts.  Their conversation touches on Sam's interview techniques, his celebrity encounters (including a humorous anecdote about Gillian Jacobs potentially becoming his nanny), and his post-sandwich digestive issues after consuming a massive sandwich from DeFontis in Brooklyn.  This leads to a discussion of DeFontis itself and how the sandwich shop discovered the show—through a large order placed by show employee, Roland.

A substantial portion of the broadcast is dedicated to a caller named Bobo, who performs a live, impromptu "one-man band" performance using kitchenware, much to the amusement (and initial annoyance) of his family.  Bobo’s mother calls in, initially expressing displeasure at being woken up, but ultimately laughing along with the hosts and Bobo.  The segment includes mention and a playing of Bobo's song, "My Dick."

The show wraps up with plugs for their social media, future broadcasts, and the upcoming Ron and Fez show. The hosts tease the Ron and Fez show's upcoming guest, Brazilian Julie, known for her ability to "drive men insane," and briefly mention a planned "cat show" segment featuring Fez's cat playing bass in a funk band.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The show never stops. We're live.  You're on, Anthony. You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Whether you like it or not, I told you, Rock, don't hit another break.  We'll go right to it. We're ready.  You know what, though? It's fucking, uh, it's Friday.  Yeah.  It's Friday.  It's Friday.  Do you think I want to do more radio on the press?  Yeah!  I'll give you a 50-50 shot here.  Okay.  Do you think on a Friday, I want to do more radio...  Okay.  ...or begin my insane amount of drinking for the weekend? 
[00:00:30]  I think this is a trick question.  All right.  Your passion for radio shines through.  I'm going to guess more radio. Am I right?  You are amazing, because that's the correct answer.  Yes!  I want to do more radio.  I knew it.  Just not with you.  Oh, shit.  I'll be moving on to my favorite place, which is the elevator going down.  Towards your house.  Towards...  The first step.  It is really the first step.  The first step begins with hitting lobby.  Yeah.  For me.  Because you have to go down and then start moving.  Then I start moving, and I get to start the weekend. 
[00:01:00]  And you, meanwhile, get to sit here for another few minutes.  And I do like when Ronnie B. comes in.  Well, I mean, I'm here, too.  Yeah, well, the before that...  Well, you know, that's...  It's on the air.  That's a give or take thing.  It doesn't matter.  Well, it's being broadcast, I guess.  Is that what you're going to say about it?  You can say that.  Okay.  You can say that.  But then the part with Ronnie B. is like the big crossover.  It reminds me of the old Opie and Anthony days with the Afro shows and stuff. 
[00:01:30]  Well, now it's the Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart show.  Sammy Sweetheart.  I heard that.  Yeah.  You have more nicknames than you really should.  People like to give me nicknames, including myself.  I used to like when it was just Intern Sam.  That was my favorite nickname you used to have.  Hated that one.  I was able to kick you around without you being such a smartass.  I've been called Hollywood Sam Roberts after yesterday's show a few times now.  Is that because of the Elton John?  Because of the red carpet thing, yeah.  Elton John interview.  The very in-depth Elton John interview.  I have to ask you about your interviews because it happened again when Clark Peters and Wendell 
[00:02:00]  Pierce came in.  Yes, yeah.  You got the classic, oh, we're on the air?  When does this start?  This happens every time we have a guest come in because we hate when we're in a commercial  break and the guest is brought in to sit there because two things can happen, none of  which is good.  One is you just sit there and don't talk and it puts a weird vibe between you and the guest  when the mics do go live. 
[00:02:30]  The other thing is you start discussing things that are cool and would have made for good  radio and then trying to recreate it on the radio never works because it's not spontaneous  anymore.  So bad.  So what we like to do is bring them in right when we come back from break and we're so  disorganized and just yapping that they sit down and we're like, take a seat, whatever,  they put the headphones on and start talking like real human beings.  Well, do you feel like that's a compliment?  Do you feel like they're saying you're completely unprofessional?  You know, this is a joke or like, hey, the casual atmosphere in here is just so good. 
[00:03:00]  I think they look at it as complete relaxation.  It's nice.  It's like, oh, that was cool.  We're kind of relaxed.  I look at it as, yes, we are completely unprofessional.  But it seems to work.  It does.  It does seem to work.  Everybody feels at ease in here.  Opie, I tried to end where he's doing more radio.  He thought he wasn't going to.  I started asking him about the interviews.  I had one last read to do for the wonderfulness that is Gamefly.com.  I've only heard good things.  And I did it.  And then I went to run out the door and Sam's like, hey, we're on, Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  And he is the sneakiest bastard in this place.  Well, I told Eric not to go to a commercial break.  Oh, you did.  That way, boom, we're right into it.  I'm surprised you didn't go right into a commercial break.  This must be a big get for your show, having me and Ann on.  I know.  This is like huge.  This is a big get for you, right?  This is fucked up.  Wait a minute.  Five minutes ago, we were on the air and it's our show.  Now I'm a guest with Opie on your show?  It's the same studio. 
[00:04:00]  Listen, read the pad data.  Oh, what does the pad data say?  Great.  I don't know.  Eric should say Maxi, you faggot.  It says After ONA Live with Sam.  With Sam.  Oh, great.  And you both have said this is my show on the air.  Yeah.  So, I mean, it is what it is.  Well, it's your show, so I guess I should just let you do it.  Oh, I mean, you're a guest, though.  I think I was a great guest.  I'm like fucking Sinatra was on Carson.  He popped in, he said hi, and then he fucking leaves.  Whenever.  Too big.  It's on his time.  Too big to be here. 
[00:04:30]  So all you guys are going to leave me with is Kenny and the sandwich guy?  Yeah, the sandwich guy.  Hey, those were great.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  No, those are great sandwiches, man.  Where's the sandwich guy?  That's him with the shirt on.  I'm still chewing on the turkey Swiss eggplant thing.  Yeah.  And I just tweeted a picture with that broad with my gut.  My fucking salty bloated gut.  You mean Gillian Jacobs?  Gillian Jacobs.  She was very cute.  I like that.  So I don't know if I should have ate that sandwich, but I'll tell you this much.  Holy shit, that was a good Sambo.  Good.  Yeah.  How do you think that's going to come out? 
[00:05:00]  Mandu?  Yeah.  You think it's going to be a smooth bowel?  You think you're going to have a little turbulence?  Yeah, it wasn't too greasy.  I like a smooth flight.  Look at the sandwich guy.  He's the expert.  He goes, no, no, you'll be good.  You'll be good.  You'll be all right.  You'll be all right.  You'll be all right.  If you have the mayo, it slides out nice.  Without the mayo, you've got to have grown a couple times.  E-Rock must be sliding out left and right.  He doesn't even notice he's shitting at this point.  Is that what the Mets are doing now?  Trying to look like fucking...  What is that?  What is that? 
[00:05:30]  That's the new cap.  Oh, it's blackout.  They're trying to make money sound hats.  I think they're trying to look like fucking Yankee hats.  Well, it's also because your hat has to match your gear.  If you're not wearing blue and orange and you still want to rep the Mets...  But I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  Play that Bobo shit, please.  Oh, my God.  That was so fucking good.  I forgot we did that today.  That was very early this morning.  Bobo woke his mother up.  These motherfuckers, figure out how to get us to do more radio.  I know.  We're doing it, baby.  What the fuck?  And no, and it's because of this fucking marionette puppet motherfucker that works for the man. 
[00:06:00]  I see where your strings are.  Right in the back office, motherfucker.  Actually, we have a clip of you that we could just play real quick.  Oh, yeah?  The Sam Roberts show can do whatever it wants.  Oh, really?  I don't care.  I don't remember ever saying that.  So we're doing whatever we're keeping you guys.  You do have a marionette puppet head.  I'm not a puppet.  And he even has like the rosy cheeks that they used to paint on the marionette puppets.  Yeah, they painted on the marionette.  You're a marionette puppet head.  You'd be scary sitting in a chair in a bedroom in the dark.  Just because I'm cherubic doesn't mean I'm a puppet. 
[00:06:30]  Cherubic?  I wouldn't say that.  What is that?  Does that mean black?  The DNA test brought back cherubic?  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Did that come back cherubic?  I don't know.  The DNA test is not my doing.  When is the DNA test?  Everyone bother me on Twitter.  Me too.  I have nothing to do with it because I can contaminate the results.  I have nothing to do with it.  I ran into Jillian Jacobs from that.  Jillian.  Did you?  Jillian?  Jillian.  What did she say?  Jillian.  She's going to become our nanny.  Really?  I did like that you went out of your way to say that would be cool for both of us. 
[00:07:00]  As if she'd be like, oh, I'm Opie's nanny.  It's going to be a pleasure for her too.  I mean, she's a big star in Community, but guess what?  She's now officially my nanny.  We're working out the numbers.  That's incredible.  I wonder why she was here later.  What else is she going to do?  They're not going to be filming Community.  You know, they take the summers off, so I got a summer nanny.  I mean, she might be able to get a movie.  What?  I think if I pursued that, I could have gone to a museum with her.  Yeah.  I cut it off because I do have a girlfriend now, but when I was the single guy and we  would have guests in and I would pitch myself to every girl, occasionally it would hit. 
[00:07:30]  Like Danielle Harris wasn't happening yesterday.  No, no, because she's got a boyfriend and that shit wasn't happening at all.  But I did go out with the penthouse pet.  Yeah, it works sometimes.  Yeah, and I think, I honestly think, and I'm not bullshitting, that we could have gone  to a museum and hung out.  And she's new famous.  Like she's famous, but she doesn't know how famous she is.  Yes, not jaded famous yet.  She has no idea that she's super famous.  She has no idea she should not even be near me.  Yeah.  Right. 
[00:08:00]  You could have gotten in there.  I could have.  Fuck, man.  What's that?  She's coming back with Joel.  She's coming back with Joel.  I hope Joel heard.  Oh, she is.  Did Rowan put lipstick on today?  I'm going.  Are you wearing lipstick?  Are they chapped or something?  Why are they so red?  What were you sucking cock?  Ew!  What were you eating?  Cherry's gone.  Hiya.  Hiya.  Did you eat some cherry shit?  You got some really red lips today.  Maybe a little lipstick from last night.  Maybe still on?  Oh.  Could be.  I'm asking questions. 
[00:08:30]  You're like Betty Boop with your lips.  Want to comment on that?  Sam is suggesting you might dress like a woman.  Ask him.  Oh, shit.  Just asking, Rowan.  She is.  Here to ask the question.  Oh, no.  He does his like a cat.  He's crazy like that.  What's the deal with all these free sandwiches?  Yeah.  What is the deal?  We got a box of sandwiches today.  You're not mafia, right?  We're all right?  Nah, nah.  Yeah.  Are we doing...  Is this a favorite?  It's just a quick plug, right?  We don't have to go any further with this.  Nah, you don't got to worry about it.  I'm going to leave the studio.  Where did these sandwiches come from?  Uh, DeFontis of Brooklyn.  Gramercy Park, 21st and 3rd. 
[00:09:00]  They're fucking good, dude.  At some time, and this time may never come, we may ask you for a sandwich.  That's right.  You know how they found out about us, DeFontis, by the way?  How, Sam?  Uh, first of all, Opie, you're leaving.  He goes, how, Sam?  And just walks out the door.  That's one of the rudest things a person could do.  That is?  Yeah.  That's really rude.  How rude is this?  Second of...  Come on, Anthony.  That's another...  That's so...  I'd say this is pretty rude, too.  And you're shaking his hand.  I didn't even finish.  Sam?  And the sandwich guy is leaving. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Do your buffer between us and the Robinson Show.  It's not a buffer.  It's a show.  I call it the buffer.  It's a show.  It's a real show.  It's useless.  Kenny, you're leaving, too?  That's Facebook slash Club Soda Kenny.  I dumped out of it, Sam.  Thank God.  Anyway, what I was going to say is the sandwich guy gets pictures with Opie and Anthony in  the hallway, which, I mean, they don't take pictures with anybody.  They're not nice people, as you can tell.  Do you want to know what the pad data said?  What did it say?  It says, Sam's show with guests, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:10:00]  Good.  Let everybody know what's going on here.  The reason that sandwich guy found out about the show is it turns out he's a big fan of  the show is because, like, a week or two ago, Roland decided to randomly order  about $175 worth of sandwiches for the people who work around here, for selected people.  So if anybody's hearing this that didn't get a sandwich, bring it up with Roland.  But that's how he found out, because Roland decided one day to order a bunch of...  I was just talking about Roland, your sandwich gathering.  Sandwich party.  I ordered a Fonte's, which is the best sandwiches. 
[00:10:30]  But it's a weird thing that you do.  Why would you order all the money where the sandwich is for no reason?  Because a birdie promised us lunch.  Mm-hmm.  And they have...  Oh.  Well, I'm just saying, it's still going to happen.  Well, so you wanted...  But I said, we're going to have a sandwich gathering before, because people were...  People were sad.  So I said, I'm going to have a sandwich gathering.  And I said, I know the best sandwich place, the Fonte's.  Now, you've brought...  Do you want to bring this up?  You can bring it up.  Well, what happened was, uh, one of our bosses said that he was going to buy us lunch while 
[00:11:00]  we were...  While ONA were on vacation and we were still here.  There was no show, so he said, I'm going to buy you lunch.  And Roland came over and told Troy and me, hey, he's getting lunch today.  And Troy and me were like, no, you're lying.  And it wasn't necessarily...  No, actually, Troy's like, you're full of shit, bro.  That's a good impression.  You're full of shit, bro.  That's right.  It wasn't even like a slight on the boss.  It was just that Roland constantly comes over with things that aren't true.  That's correct.  And just tries to get people to believe him, and then goes...  That's true. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And so we were like, you're lying.  You're not telling the truth.  As it turned out, Roland was telling the truth, which I found out, because Roland, I made a  bet with you.  Yes.  I said, there's no way you're telling the truth.  And if I did tell the truth, I get a toast at the 10 o'clock hour.  Exactly.  You said, you want to make a bet?  I said, yeah, what do you want to bet?  And you said, let me host the 10 o'clock hour.  I thought he said he gets a toast on the 10 o'clock hour.  No.  That would have been a terrible bet.  A toast to Roland!  No. 
[00:12:00]  And you won the bet.  Yes.  You never got the lunch, but technically you weren't lying.  No, but I think he said he's still going to do our lunch, but since people were excited,  I decided to throw a sandwich party.  That's what happened.  He sent out a corporate email on it.  Well, the question now, Roland, is what day will you be hosting the show?  It's your call.  It's your hour.  Well, we're going to do it next week.  Yes.  You're going to be ready for it?  Yeah.  You're going to have to do all the interviews with people in the hallway and do everything.  Pick the bits.  That's fine.  All right.  Well, I look forward to it. 
[00:12:30]  I just don't want you to be intimidated by my powers.  I'll just be sidekick.  All right.  I mean, if you shine, you're going to take it away from me.  No doubt about it.  Yeah, see.  Did anybody enjoy the sandwich party, though?  The gallery?  Well, everybody who was invited.  Oh.  It was a limited party, though.  It was.  All right.  Exclusive.  Well, we thank DeFontes for stopping by and bringing everybody's sandwiches today.  Thank you.  You can bring us free food anytime you want.  Anytime.  What's the website for that again?  Is there a website?  Yeah.  www.defontesofbrooklyn.com. 
[00:13:00]  D-E-F-O-N-T-E-S.  Yes.  Yes.  DeFontes.  Thank you so much.  They're not just sandwiches.  They're bits of heaven.  Yeah, they are good sandwiches.  Even I ate it, and I have a very limited palate.  Even Opie ate it, too, which he doesn't eat.  I mean, he went to take two more to take home.  Yeah.  I mean, he's very nutritious about his food, but he did.  He took a couple of sandwiches home.  Wait, I just got an email from the person.  From the boss?  It said, please stop talking about it.  Not funny.  Oh, boy, Roland.  You're in trouble.  No, he wants to talk to you afterwards.  Well, first of all, you said that, and you started reading the email before you took 
[00:13:30]  your phone out of your pocket.  That's how I knew it.  So, yeah, you really had me going there for a minute.  But, now, E-Rock, as Opie and Anthony were talking about earlier, Bobo called in at  the top of the show.  Now, to those of you who don't listen from 6 a.m. on, you're making a big mistake, because  the action starts as soon as Opie and Anthony begins.  Bobo called in with his new bit, Bobo One Man Band.  He's been doing it all week.  Today's was absolutely the best.  But before we play today's, I want to play how the Bobo One Man Band bit started. 
[00:14:00]  We're going to chronicle the entire thing on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Correct, E-Rock?  As much as we can, yes.  Look, we've got time to fill on the countdown.  Uh, okay.  And more Bobo is more better, as far as I'm concerned.  Really?  Well, as far as I'm concerned.  Okay.  This was Tuesday.  Tuesday.  He was on the air.  He was trying out characters to try to get back on the show.  And we told him to smash some pots and pans. 
[00:14:30]  It was fantastic.  We wanted him to wake everybody up.  I was just introing a bit.  Ron and Fez here yet?  I was just introing a bit.  Don't you interrupt it.  Hey.  What?  So you think it was Barbra Streisand?  I think it was.  Seriously?  I think so.  Well, I mean, at this point...  Let's not play our roles.  Let's be, like, normal.  Did I get Barbra Streisand or what?  I think there's a strong possibility that you could have.  Roland said that she went into an Escalade.  She ran down the street and jumped into an Escalade. 
[00:15:00]  Did she?  That's what Roland said.  And Roland lies all the time, so it doesn't necessarily mean it happened.  That is the weirdest video I've made because I really thought I was putting one over on  the listeners.  Yeah.  The viewers.  But then the viewers...  Because I'm like, this is a great lookalike of Barbra Streisand.  I'm going to have fun with this.  Make people think I actually got Barbra Streisand.  So then I play it for Jimmy and Ann.  Like, look at this.  I got Barbra Streisand.  I'm saying it as a joke.  And then all of a sudden Jimmy's like, yeah, that's Barbra Streisand.  I'm like, wait, did I film her and I didn't even know it?  So your video is so good that you've convinced yourself that the Barbra Streisand lookalike 
[00:15:30]  could be Barbra Streisand.  Now I'm really confused.  Really confused.  You have to find her.  You have to go back to where you were every day until that woman, whether it's Barbra Streisand  or not, is back in that spot.  And ask her, no, seriously, I need to know.  Are you Barbra Streisand?  I need to know.  Well, it's on my Twitter.  It's on OP Radio YouTube Twitter.  I wasn't promoting.  Well, I know you're not promoting.  We're just discussing.  But I need everybody to come on board with me.  We were discussing that turned into a nice plug for me. 
[00:16:00]  So I lucked out.  I mean, you're a YouTube Twitter phenomenon.  It's like, who doesn't know your Twitter name is OP Radio by now?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Hmm.  Kenny plugged his Facebook again.  He did?  Yeah.  He always just comes in here and plugs me.  What bit are we doing?  Well, I was just about to start the Bobo thing and play...  I mean, I should get out of here because that shit was funny.  Yeah.  Well, I was going to play Tuesdays first.  Yeah.  To get everybody on board.  Yeah.  The build up to today?  Today's was the best.  I mean, it was amazing.  And you know, we have to now take that out on the street somewhere. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  The one-man band?  I mean, you thought...  Any suggestions?  Fuck.  Fucking do not Sam on Twitter.  I don't want to deal with suggestions for Bobo's one-man band.  I got enough to worry about.  But maybe we do a Starbucks or something.  Yeah.  I was just about to say that.  Everywhere we went with Voss for the comedy tour, it would be great for Bobo, the one-man band,  to come in and sing.  Because the Bobo one-man band is much bigger than his apartment at this point.  Yeah.  So we have to take it to the next level until we all get arrested and the show gets kicked  off the air.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the way this show has to go out. 
[00:17:00]  It's having Bobo smashing pots and pans in public places.  Right.  While a couple's having sex at a church.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's take this to 2011 and really make it happen.  Nice.  I love this.  Happy Easter.  Happy Easter to you too, Opie.  This is Tuesday's Bobo, the one-man band.  Hey, Rob.  Love you.  It's how the whole thing started.  You got that on tape.  I know.  He was kidding.  It's how the whole thing started when we, for Bobo, invented the one-man band.  It's from Tuesday Morning Show. 
[00:17:30]  After O&A Live.  Bobo?  Yeah, I'm back.  I'm back.  You got the pot and pan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm back.  Now smash them together hard and sing Meet the Mets.  We can hear you.  All right.  Meet the Mets.  Meet the Mets.  Meet the Mets.  Let's try the Mets.  You have the time of your life.  But the Pets are really shocking. 
[00:18:00]  You all run over the wall.  East side, west side.  Everybody.  B-B-B-T-S, that's a New York fan.  Oh.  I can't.  For them.  Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah?  That was good.  Good.  I'll give you that, but you need to do it like a parade, okay?  Okay, so march through the house.  March through the house and do the same thing you just did.  They won't get mad.  Just tell them it's for the show.  They'll understand.  It's for the show.  But you've got to march like a marching band through the house.  Loud.  And keep the phone somewhere close to you. 
[00:19:00]  I'll keep it in the middle of the kitchen, all right?  Shannon, this is for the show, all right?  All right, go ahead.  I won't be harmed, all right?  I'm just trying to make sure Shannon gets out.  Just do it, just do it.  Go, go, go.  We don't have time.  Come on, Bo-Bo.  Let's go.  Go, go, go, go, go.  What?  What?  He's bashing pots and pans in his house, at this ungodly hour of the morning! 
[00:19:30]  How'd that work out? 
[00:20:00]  It worked out good.  Yeah? How's your sister holding up?  Everyone awake now?  Oh, believe me. Here you are.  You do not want to know the look on my sister's face and my mother's face.  I'm sure it's no worse than the fucking look in the delivery room.  Oh, go ahead. You just keep talking. 
[00:20:30]  My mother looks like this Shannon was born.  Yeah, we...  What?  Jimmy had a much better job.  Is that your hot sister?  Hey, Bobo, can you do the big finish and smash a glass on the floor?  Yeah, you just got my...  Believe me, you won't know how my sister's looking right now.  I'm all freaking tired of it.  I finally got to see you freaking wake me up.  Come on, for the show, y'all.  Shut up, bitch. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, shut up, bitch.  That's Bobo's...  Wow, she's cute.  Oh, maybe not.  She's 1316 in September.  All right.  Well, that's wonderful.  Yeah, I did ask her on a trip to North Carolina. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  All right.  A trip to North Carolina.  It's not bad to hear the song.  I felt it was a little too late, though.  If you can call back tomorrow at 612.  Yeah, yeah.  Call back tomorrow.  I like this character.  Bobo, the one-man band?  Yeah, we like that.  All right.  I got to have some work from my mother, all right, to cover her down right now.  Is she mad?  Well, why don't you talk to her right now?  Why don't we talk to her?  You really want to talk to her?  Well, let's hear you smooth things over with her.  Go ahead.  All right. 
[00:22:00]  Mom, all right.  They want to talk to you briefly, all right?  What a nice wake-up call.  Hi.  We don't know what your son was up to.  That was weird.  Was he being loud?  No, just a little.  Like the neighbors upstairs and the dogs started barking.  I heard the dog barking.  We're asking him to keep it down.  I guess now we can get evicted.  Well, he had a character that he wanted to show us for the program.  And it's...  What character was that? 
[00:22:30]  Being annoying?  No, Bobo, the one-man band.  Yeah, Bobo, the one-man band.  Bobo, the one-man band is the character.  I like it, though.  It's a good character.  It is a good character.  Oh, Daniel, they love it so much.  You cannot go to their house and wake them up.  And you know how he loves being on the show, and I think he's found a new in.  Bobo, the one-man band.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know he loves the show, but God damn it.  People need to sleep.  I was trying to tell him that, but he just insisted on playing his instruments.  Yeah, he wanted to keep playing it. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, he wanted to blame it all on him.  No, no, not blame it on him.  It's just it makes him happy.  So we're like, yeah, go ahead.  Do it.  It's fun.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Are you being sarcastic?  I think she is.  Are you?  Oh, I love you guys, but God, you guys have a pain in the ass.  That should be on a poster.  Let me put the pain in the ass back on the phone.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah, Bobo.  Great job, by the way.  Bobo, could you tell your mom to get in the kitchen and make you some fucking food? 
[00:23:30]  Yep, I'm getting in the kitchen and make me some fucking food.  So that's how the whole thing started with Bobo and the one-man band.  That was earlier this week.  We'll recap the entire saga on the countdown over the weekend.  But Bobo, when he gets a little success, he doesn't know how to let it go.  He doesn't know how to just rest on his laurels, as it were. 
[00:24:00]  He always needs it to continue.  He wants gratification every single day.  So he was trying for the rest of the week.  He failed every day after Tuesday.  And the closest thing that he had to succeeding was when he called us in the office  and he sang a song for us that became famous also on the air this week.  This is Bobo's penis song.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  It, I never got in late because my tiny little dick. 
[00:24:30]  If you show your tip, my tiny little dick goes up and it,  and there was one time that Eric made me come while watching gay porn.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I don't know what surrounded the creation of that song.  Who told him to use my name?  That's what I want to know, Eric.  Is that true, those lyrics?  No, that's not true.  I never talk to Bobo ever.  He's always on the phone in your office. 
[00:25:00]  It's a weird thing for him to say, Eric.  That's all I'm going to say.  Now, today, it happened hours ago at this point.  This show is way too long.  Not this show.  The show that's on before.  This, Opie and Anthony.  It's too many hours.  It happened hours ago.  The very beginning of the show, Bobo called up and he said,  I want to do the one-man band thing again.  I want to make it right.  What did you say?  What did you say, Roland?  Nothing.  All right.  Well, then, if you're not going to say something for the audience,  don't say anything, okay? 
[00:25:30]  He nodded yes.  It was, he wanted to get the one-man band right.  And it was something that was so important to him, and he succeeded.  He did it.  It started the show.  He woke his entire house up at 6 o'clock in the morning.  If you didn't hear it, we're about to play it.  If you did hear it, you're going to want to hear it again.  I mean, this is one of my favorite moments in Opie and Anthony history, I think.  And we'll replay it on the countdown as well.  But this is it.  Bobo, the one-man band, he pulls it off this morning. 
[00:26:00]  After ONA Live.  Bobo!  Yeah, I'm here.  Oh, God.  Are you ready for the one-man band today?  Yep, that's right.  The one-man band.  All right.  Now, explain some shit.  Is your mom home?  She's home this time.  They're both home this time.  And what are they doing right now?  Probably sleeping.  All right, where are you?  I'm in the kitchen.  You're in the kitchen very close to your mom and your sister, okay? 
[00:26:30]  And what kind of stuff have you got for your one-man band today?  Hey, I got an air horn, a kazoo, a little noisemaker like you use a New Year's, and the pots and pans.  The pots and pans.  All right, and what song did you practice?  No, it's the...  Remember that original song you heard yesterday?  Oh, the original song about your dick?  Yeah, yeah, that song.  Oh, my God.  He's going to sing the My Dick's My Dick song?  Which is a great song, by the way.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's just like Friday, Friday.  It should be the new Friday song. 
[00:27:00]  Party, party, party, party, party.  We're expecting 150 million views for that song.  Please, please.  We just got to make a video.  I'm going to be playing this on a kazoo.  All right, that's fine.  I'm going to be playing this on a kazoo.  So, it's Bobo's one-man band.  Are you ready, Bobo?  Now, I want to know, first of all, you're in the kitchen, right?  Yeah.  How far from the kitchen is your mom's room and your sister's room?  It's a little bit of distance.  It's around somewhere in the middle.  Like, you can face the entrances to them.  All right, that gives me no bearing on... 
[00:27:30]  It's 15 feet away.  It's right there.  What I can tell you is it's very close, but it's really difficult to wake him up.  Oh, is it?  Even with pots and pans?  Why?  You woke him up the other day?  Yeah.  Yeah, because of a loud noise.  All right.  All right.  Well, we expect a lot of loud noise right now, too.  All right?  All right.  All right.  The thing's in the middle of the kitchen.  Okay.  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  And go! 
[00:28:00]  Bobo, one-man band.  All right.  All right.  Oh.  No.  hello yeah keep playing what's wrong with you you're the one-man bed let's go play go go go 
[00:28:30]  and now use the national anthem 
[00:29:00]  heat  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[00:29:30]  oh  oh  I guess your mom's up.  Yes, she is.  Now just smash the pants together.  Go ahead.  Just smash them.  And say.  And keep going.  And sing I'm sorry, mommy.  Yeah, yeah.  Go I'm sorry, mommy.  Do the I'm sorry, mommy song. 
[00:30:00]  Keep going.  Keep going.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you have to sing I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm sorry, mommy.  And smash the pants.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm very sorry I woke you up in the morning.  I'm very sorry.  I'm very sorry.  Yes, we have some water in your face.  And the band plays on. 
[00:30:30]  Daniel.  That's beautiful.  That's a great way to wake someone up.  That would be a great way to introduce Jimmy at Foxwoods.  Oh, wow.  That's not a bad idea.  It certainly is.  It certainly is.  Wow, good job.  Excellent job.  Bobo.  Very funny. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, you guys got my name information, right?  Well, I want to make sure.  For what?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  You need to say, I'm on the phone, bitch.  I'm on the phone, bitch.  But yeah, you got my name information, right?  For what?  I mean, so I can see Jimmy at Foxwood.  Yes, well, you can have a ticket, Daniel. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, we'll figure it out, though.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  You guys have a great weekend, and happy birthday, Anthony.  Oh, thanks.  What?  You probably met yesterday.  Well, I misread the date you said your birthday.  I was trying to remember.  I got a reminder.  I got so many birthdays, I got to remember in April.  You're falling apart here.  All right.  You're unraveling.  You did good.  Good job.  Don't blow it.  All right, Bobo.  Great job.  Don't start wishing everybody a happy birthday.  Leave on the high note. 
[00:32:00]  Exactly.  Bobo and the one-man band.  There you go.  Excellent.  What happened?  Why has something always happened?  How come nothing?  Every time the Stone Cold music gets played on Ron and Fez, it always goes off smooth without  a hitch.  It hits and stops.  You guys got my name information, didn't you?  I want to go up there and see that Foxwood.  If you got my name information, check again to see if all the name information is down.  Ron, you know.  I did everything I was asked to do.  Now I'd like my name information to be taken.  But you know you have to listen from the beginning of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:32:30]  You don't know what's going to start.  I know.  I got to stop sleeping in.  I mean, whether it's a Ron Bennington walk-in, whether it's a Bobo calling.  Yeah, you never know what's going to happen.  I like to hear the replay of that, too, just to hear how tired they are at 6 o'clock.  We're like Bobo's doing this stuff, and they're going, that's great, man.  Yeah, yeah, Bobo.  Good job, buddy.  Bobo's going, you got my name and info, right?  My name information, you got it all, right?  One.  Do you ever notice that the smaller the IQ, the more detail-oriented people get? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Well, they don't have their minds clouded up with all that information and stuff.  I remember when I was at Rockahool Luau, Stalker Patty worried constantly that I was going to drive her back to the city.  And I would be taking a piss, and Patty would be next to me.  Let me know before you're heading back to the city.  You're going back to the city, right?  They're worried.  We wonder about, like, Stalker Patty and Bobo and stuff.  What do they laugh at when they listen to your show and our show?  Yeah, what actually brings them into it? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, that is a good point.  They come on, and they don't get anything.  Yeah, but I was going to say the same of Fez.  What makes them think?  No, it isn't.  And plus, he's got his cat's going to be talking today.  Yes!  Today, Fez's cat's going to be playing in a funk band.  Fez's cat, I didn't know this, apparently he plays bass, but he's going to be playing with the New York Funk Exchange.  I've told everybody I know about the cat show.  Wait, so no one you know listens to me? 
[00:34:00]  You don't know a single person?  I said, no, as in, did you hear it?  Some said, yes, of course I did, Sam.  I listen all the time.  Others said, no, what's this Rod and Fez show?  Tell me about it.  A few people said, what is satellite radio?  I don't get that.  You mean like TV?  You mean like FM?  Well, we've got to let you get to the cat show.  That's what's going on today, right?  Every show is a cat show.  Prettiest cat.  It's a tabby.  Fez is telling us, this is a tabby.  I don't know what to say back to you.  Well, I can't wait.  The big Friday Ron and Fez show. 
[00:34:30]  And for people, Brazilian Julie coming in today.  She'll be here today?  She's going to be here, and she says that she has tricks to drive men insane.  What are you going to get her to say?  Hopefully, if it takes me two and a half hours, I will get her to say nookie.  Say nookie.  Say nookie.  Say nookie.  I can't wait.  The Friday Ron and Fez show.  Happy Easter, everybody.  Well, today's a good Friday.  Happy good Friday.  Today's the day that our Lord died, so this is a sad day for us. 
[00:35:00]  But then Sunday, we're ecstatically happy.  Thank God for that.  Literally.  Good Friday is about to get a whole lot better, because Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you on Monday.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.
