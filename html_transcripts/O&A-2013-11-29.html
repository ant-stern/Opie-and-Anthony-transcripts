<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a diverse range of guests and topics, weaving between celebrity interviews, personal anecdotes from the hosts and guests, and discussions of current events.  The show opened with Lyle Lovett and Mark Maron.  Maron detailed his negative experiences in Buffalo, contrasting them with his surprisingly positive time at Niagara Falls, despite initially disliking the surrounding area.  He discussed his upcoming third marriage and anxieties about fatherhood, recounting a humorous, pancake-fueled proposal gone slightly awry.  Other topics included his surreal interview with a shirtless Iggy Pop, his upcoming appearance on David Letterman, his strained relationship with his father, his podcast's 400th episode (also featuring Iggy Pop), travel mishaps, and the absurdity of people in blue ponchos at Niagara Falls.  The conversation also touched on Paula Dean and a tightrope walker between the Twin Towers, and the terrors of the deep, including muskelunge fish.

Next, comedian Jesse Joyce joined the show, sharing his experiences performing in the dangerous and chaotic Alaskan club "She'll Kill Charlie's," complete with stories of criminal bouncers and a “murderer” banned from entry. He described the harsh Alaskan winters, the long flights, and the unique club atmosphere, including a midget in a tuxedo operating the metal detector.  Joyce also painted a grim picture of death and alcohol abuse in Alaska.  He then transitioned to his work writing jokes for Seth MacFarlane's Oscars hosting gig, mentioning the worldwide attention garnered by a John Wilkes Booth joke and his encounters with numerous celebrities backstage, including Liam Neeson, Michael Douglas, Reese Witherspoon, and Robert Downey Jr. (with whom he smoked).  He also commented on the appearances of Charlize Theron and Renée Zellweger.

The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton's personal life.  Norton recounted dating Vladimir Putin's translator, a multilingual woman involved in a past international incident due to a mistranslation during nuclear disarmament talks, and his subsequent abandonment of her for a Kentucky cocktail waitress, resulting in the translator sleeping with his roommate.  He shared anecdotes about past anxieties, his fear of his parents being kidnapped, his dislike of horror movies, and a humorous story about a six-year-old girl in a prom dress following him to his hotel room.  The hosts then discussed a YouTube video comparing the advertised luxury versus the chaotic reality of Barry Williams' Branson show and Yakov Smirnoff's dinner theater, leading to further reminiscing about past Opie and Anthony segments, including their take on a *Happy Days* episode and a Joe Piscopo Showtime special. Norton concluded his segment by recounting his early career experiences, including his first paid acting gig on *Seinfeld* and living in a mold-infested house despite outward appearances of success.

A guest named Pat then joined the show. The segment started with a story about a phone bill payment gone wrong, followed by a discussion about credit card fraud stemming from the storyteller’s use of prostitutes.  This led to Jim Norton recounting extremely graphic and explicit stories involving his experiences with prostitutes, including details of sexual acts and drug use.  Pat then promoted his Adult Swim show, *The Heart She Holler*, describing it as bizarre and offensive, and discussed his upcoming reading of *Moby Dick* at a Los Angeles public library, highlighting the book's disturbing themes.  The conversation touched upon Herman Melville’s life and the eventual recognition of *Moby Dick*. The hosts and Pat then discussed the challenges of parenthood, with Norton expressing frustrations about his children and his wife's post-motherhood changes.  Pat concluded his segment by recounting his firing from SiriusXM radio and comparing it to past negative experiences with club owners and an inappropriate massage at a Montana bed and breakfast.  The hosts discussed the state of the comedy world and the transition to podcasting, briefly mentioning Rob Delaney as a future guest.


Rob Delaney joined the show next, discussing Hugh Jackman, his new board game "War of Words" (featuring game pieces like a van labeled "SS Butt Toucher"), and various comedians, including Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Cosby, and Louis C.K. A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the sexuality of historical figures, Abraham Lincoln and James Buchanan.  The conversation included numerous crude and sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes about Delaney's personal life and interactions with women.  He also shared stories of uncomfortable fan encounters and negative experiences with girlfriends who ignored his fans. Adam Carolla then joined the show, discussing his experiences with Jay Leno and Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson himself called in to wish Jim Norton a happy birthday.  The conversation concluded with further discussion of the comedians' careers and schedules.


The show concluded with a phone call from Mike Tyson.  He discussed his luxurious home (originally a "lust laboratory"), his successful one-man show, his physical transformation, and his views on masculinity.  The conversation touched on a Kazakhstani boxer, comparing him to Manu Ginobili;  the differences between boxing and UFC; the changing landscape of radio and audience sensitivities; and the media's tendency to sensationalize news stories, using examples like the Alec Baldwin incident, the Trayvon Martin case, the Casey Anthony trial, and a Florida teacher who had sex with a student.  The hosts also shared anecdotes about their own experiences with their children's teachers and media coverage affecting their marriages. Finally, they praised Adam Carolla's successful podcast and its impact on the media landscape.

[00:11:30]  horrendous he has horrendous marriage stories yes yes okay all right what's different what's  different what what is happening in your head i'm terrified of this one yeah i think you are  that's i think that's what's different i'm terrified and i'm concerned man yeah i don't  think i know the difference between you know the warmth of rage when it surrounds my heart and the  warmth of love when it's around the same thing i i know that when the warmth of rage surrounds my 
[00:12:00]  heart i'm thinking like fuck you but when the warmth of love surrounds my heart i'm afraid of that  so there's some mixture i have to find the middle but here's what happened so i buy this ring and i  decide i'm going to give it to her on her birthday which is three weeks away she knew it was coming  though not really i mean i i it was a surprise to her i don't think she really believed that i was  going to do it and i'm not you know i don't know that i did either but i knew i was going to give it  on on her birthday but it was hilarious because i bought that ring i put it in the drawer and that ring  just turned on this scrutiny like i knew it was out there and i knew i had it and i was planning on doing  it so every minute of every fucking day i was like all right this is it this is what i'm gonna do 
[00:12:30]  i'm watching her eyes i'm watching her mouth i'm watching what she says i'm watching how she walks  i'm like i don't know that that's a weird thing that walk you know like it's like it just turned  on this thing in my head where it's like are you fucking sure you're gonna do this you're never  gonna be sure everything's under a microscope all of a sudden and then her birthday comes and i  didn't know how i was gonna do it i thought like why not just put it because it's her first time  she wants to be excited i'm a jaded fuck you know i want to try to make it good for her so i didn't 
[00:13:00]  know how to give it to her i knew i had to do something special because she was talking about  like are you gonna put it in a champagne glass i don't know why all of a sudden i'm doing dice's  girls  no but she said you're gonna put it in a champagne glass at dinner and i'm like i don't know what  the fuck i'm gonna do i'm not gonna do that because obviously you read that somewhere  so so my thought was why not just put it in the bed so she rolls over on it goes what's that  ow and then my friend jonas said well then she might think you fuck someone else in your bed  but uh that's funny yeah so uh so i decided all right i'm gonna make her pancakes and work from 
[00:13:30]  there and i said i'm gonna make you pancakes for your birthday and i didn't even know if i had the  shit for pancakes it turns out i had the shit for pancakes so i make pancakes i figure i'm gonna put  the ring right on top of the center pancake oh like that and but the problem was she was in bed i put  the ring in the bedroom to follow through with the rolling over on it plan so uh so now she's in bed  i'm making these fucking pancakes and i'm like why don't you come out and eat your pancakes  she's like i thought i was getting breakfast in bed no formal breakfast today because i had to get 
[00:14:00]  the ring out of there yeah so i force her out you know i'm like just come on eat at the table like  a person so she comes out and i run back into the room to grab the ring i put it in my in the pocket  of my robe and i come back out and she goes why'd you run back to the room and i don't know why i  was caught off guard but i swear to god i said i had to get something for my cock that's what i said  i don't even know why i said that but on some level it's kind of true yeah so then i go into  the kitchen i stick that fucking ring right in the middle of the pancake and i serve her the pancake 
[00:14:30]  she starts crying she's like oh my god and i take it out of the pancake i stick it on her finger i go  will you marry me she goes ow ow hot it's hot  so i gotta take the ring off because i burn her fucking finger with the ring i don't know if  that's a sign yeah that's trying to re-propose oh my god let's do it again will you marry me she's  like of course i will wow immediately i'm like what i do in my head oh is there a date or anything no  but like it's like i thought you know i always think it's gonna buy me a little time you know

[00:22:00]  possibly do and i'm like but you know fuck it she didn't want to eat there you know  so i'm just storming down the mall oh no i don't know and i'm sort of pacing her well i'm watching  her walk away on the other side yeah and uh and then she texts me she's like i love you what are we  doing oh and then i'm like i love you too i'll meet you in front of the capital so we met in front of  the capital i put the ring back on her finger and asked her to marry me again i did that three times  three in a week with the same ring in a week yeah so what did you wind up eating what did you wind 
[00:22:30]  up eating oh fuck what did we uh we went to she wanted to go see the dinosaur bones and uh you know  then we had she wanted chipotle so that's what's that chipotle oh yes i thought yeah one last time  you looked at dinosaurs it's not it's not nothing i love dinosaurs like a month ago really in new york  because you got kids yeah but it's amazing one in my yard yes do you well i got i got i got one of 
[00:23:00]  those like yeah we'll show you five and a half foot velociraptors oh you do really and i put it by  my jacuzzi really yeah it's like you really love dinosaur i love no he loves children  gotta get the kids into the jacuzzi  dinosaur bones rule there you go there's his dinosaur oh that's great my little dinosaur i just  when you when you look at him you're like holy fuck you and this was a millions and millions of 
[00:23:30]  years ago it's hard you know it's a weird moment of like you're very impressed but you're also like  oh we're doomed i said yeah yeah fucking things die for whatever reason just imagine that come out of  nowhere that they were actually there at some point they actually yeah lived around it's like that's a  monster that's a real life monster yeah and it was walking the earth i just hate they put the dates  on like oh really this is like 80 billion years ago but also when you see the ones that were in the  ocean that's why i don't go right because in my mind a couple of them have to be out still there  they've got to be out and they're like as big as this building like giant teeth big that's that 
[00:24:00]  scares the shit out of me monsters under the water yeah i can't even go into a pool at night  we don't know at night yeah if i can't see the bottom creepy down there i don't know what got in  the pool you don't know what's in there when you go in the ocean it's like horrendous down  it's got this weird you could see a little bit down here but i'm not going to show you much  the ocean does not tip its hand you fucking in there it's all based on faith and the light is  what only 200 feet i think after that it's just complete fucking darkness oh it's horrible it's 
[00:24:30]  a horrible feeling those people that can just jump off boats and swim around i can't talk about it  we took a lot of boats across lake erie and even in a lake right we would stop in the middle and uh  you know the tunes are cranking and we go for a swim and we would we would take our showers  because it's fresh water yeah and when you dive off that boat you're like what the fuck is staring  right back at me i was petrified i'm not even gonna make believe and then i would swim around  the boat just keep the boat nice and close yeah a real fucking wimp if you looked at where you were 
[00:25:00]  and what how big you are if you drained all the water and just put you in in midair where the water  would be you're you're like hovering over mountain ranges sure and all kinds of goodies are down  there right horrendous monsters you're a speck but if you close your eyes it's all good yeah i mean  you keep your eyes closed when you jump in right the odds are with you probably in a lake because  i don't want to open that eye and see some blurry shit coming at me oh my gosh what's the worst it  could be a giant catfish i don't know there's no sharks in the lake there's no dragons they got 
[00:25:30]  some shit what's that show on tv the river monsters and river monsters is a great show  with the zombie kids eating your teeth what is that it's windshield wipers sitting in the toes  nibbling on you you see the alligator turtle thing no this looks like it's fucking a dinosaur yeah  i don't know the name of it anymore but yeah they're out there what about the guys we talk about  from time to time on our show the guys that go noodling would you do that i don't know what noodling is 
[00:26:00]  i've never heard of noodling i thought it was a guitar term they feel like a noodle they go in  these swamps and these riverbeds yeah and they go for the cat is it catfish they're going for catfish  yeah it's all kinds of and they put their arm in these fucking holes and and the catfish bites  them all the way they pull it out halfway up their forearm that's how they catch these things can you  imagine fucking doing that i don't like when my foot hits something at the beach that feels a little  like it's not a rock or a shell or something like i don't know what that is i can't get away from it 
[00:26:30]  fast enough and you don't know it's just part of the larger thing right oh that's just the eyelid  of something that's inside of a car yeah you don't want to oh it's fucking creepy something brushes  against your leg which was probably like seaweed or something but to me it's a giant monster i just  wear crunchy shoes now just crunch everything i don't give a fuck yeah it's a good idea to wear  those uh i like those scuba booties that all that yeah why the fuck would you go out there 
[00:27:00]  it makes you feel safer it's the same danger i don't want to step on i used to be petrified of  i didn't even know where they are where they're fucking indigenous too i uh stepping on a rockfish  because i heard like rockfish has those spines yeah yeah right and they put poison in you and you're  pretty much dead yeah i'd be at the beach just going i'm gonna step on a rockfish really yeah i always  thought i was stepping on a rockfish or even fucking jellyfish man i didn't hurt yes i never  got hit by one of those never terrible oh they fucking suck when you get stung or barracudas or 
[00:27:30]  mora eels whatever all of it long out and we had horseshoe crabs too they're not gonna hurt you i know  but as a kid it's that big spiny thing and your friends tell you they fucking stab you with it it's  terrifying looking it is but they're like they're very slow oh yeah but maybe in the water in the water  you're very slow try yeah you and that's just another thing like you could be king shit on dry  land yeah you're fucking top of the food chain and everything you drop quite a few levels uh as far  as the right you're a bullion cube yes mark yeah you should go diving and you'll realize that you 
[00:28:00]  know first of all it's almost impossible to see a fucking fish i don't even know where the fuck they  all are i snorkel and if you do see a fish you realize they they fucking run away from run away they  swim away from you immediately they're scared shitless but i went snorkeling in uh kawaii and i  like doing it but you know when you get the snorkel going you get out on the reef and then you see  that drop off at the edge of the reef and then yeah it's cool but still like i can't stop from  seeing something coming out of that dark you look out there and you're like that's just a mouse 
[00:28:30]  never ending yeah yeah something could just come right at me and what am i gonna do and it's always  huge yes right giant like it's something like you've never seen before like you've imagined it  you'd be looking going what is is that something moving and then before you know it's like oh my  god it's a giant monster coming for me a monster yeah exactly yeah like the whole island just  lifts up you think it's a tiny fish and then it's the big reveal where it's as big as a fucking giant  yeah the tiny fish is just on it some sort of line doing that thing coming at you back and forth 
[00:29:00]  swimming and you're like i can't fucking outrun this just bubbles yeah yeah yeah  fucking petrified screaming underwater just cloud of blood yeah cloud of blood watching your own  blood rise up around you that's terrible half of you starts bobbing oh it's just horrible it's like 
[00:29:30]  waving what do you die from first like the loss of blood for being bitten in half or do you drown  or what it just seems uh either way it's only a few seconds for you to think about it i would gather  right you can't breathe and i'm half gone mark you've been busy oh yeah yeah i'm doing uh i'm doing  like i'm here because i'm doing panel on letterman for the first time ever on wednesday  congratulations on that there's been a lot of things where where you know you spend your like i've done  stand up on there a few times over the 25 years but not a lot are you nervous doing panel well i 
[00:30:00]  know how to do it but it's dave you know and he's like my guy yeah you know and i've been watching  him since day one when i was in college and as a comic you sort of like when when he moved and you  know he took a few panel guys with him as far as stand-ups like my i thought in my mind well  that's over i'm never gonna do panel with him right like and now it's happening and i feel like all  right so i can quit like i think like there's part of me that feels like that was some great goal  achieved i mean hopefully i don't get bumped or something but yeah i'm nervous because i want to 
[00:30:30]  you know i mean he's the best so i don't think i'm gonna flounder you won't get bumped for panel  i don't think so but uh you know i'm just trying to figure out what uh what thing is to do because  yeah i want to do well and i want because i get a little i don't get nervous but i know i'm going to  be sitting there like i did jay leno for the first time ever and i you know i don't really watch jay  and but when i was pushing the book and pushing the show i'm like why not do it it was kind of  interesting because he came into the dressing room before i went on for like a half hour yeah  we had we had we had that we couldn't believe it me and ann talked about it after the fact going 
[00:31:00]  don't you have a show to prepare for he's hanging out having a good old time i'm like holy fuck when  does he get ready yeah he's standing there in his denim shirt yes we had the same experience  talking cars and he was talking about uh you know shock jocks and radio and just whatever oh yeah  i loved that i loved it yeah yeah but he came backstage he's like yeah i didn't think you'd do  this i didn't think you'd do my show i tell you oh yeah the tonight show yeah sure i didn't think  you're like well he thought i was in conan camp oh you know like he thought i was part of you know 
[00:31:30]  on some level i never sought to do it because i just didn't watch it right and it was not you  know and whatever i didn't i was i was not doing it on principle right that that was the truth  but then like you know when all of a sudden you have an opportunity  like i'm pushing the book and i got the show and i'm going to do panel i don't have to do stand-up  i'm like why not it's still the tonight show and and i and i have that moment you know the the  feeling well don't matter who the host is where you know you see people on tv and then when you're  sitting there right next to them and the cameras are on oh man it's like you think you're just talking 
[00:32:00]  to somebody but you're not it's crazy everything is heightened and you know it's happening in the  moment and you're like oh my god he's right there and i with dave i i have to i have to hide that  shit because you can't sit there and go oh my god you're right there you know that would be a  great way to open up oh my god you're right here right there i see this on television yeah i saw you  on the thing this is crazy yeah but i do have that feeling it's the weirdest thing you're right because 
[00:32:30]  you're sitting there looking at the face yeah and and words are coming out of your mouth you're  talking right but you're thinking like holy shit am i doing this exactly this is what i've watched  are people watching this and seeing me like i saw other people sitting there and then you're just  like this is the most oddest fucking thing i get so nervous that i relax it's almost like it's like  i'm so doomed to fail i feel like somebody who's about to be executed and has resigned himself to 
[00:33:00]  the fact that my brains are going to be splattered and that helps sometimes when you get when you get  so anxious or nervous about something and you're and you just go into a weird paralysis like you  just hit this peak and you're like like you're in a you're like you're locked in accepting your  fate but it happens with conan too where i'm sitting there looking at him because i don't know what you  expect them to do you know because they do they're doing that every night it's like you guys do this  every day right so but you know you're like you know i've never talked to this guy before 
[00:33:30]  so you're all you're there with all this juice and he's like  yeah yeah like are we talking it's like and then you realize that he fucking does this every night  right this is his audience there's a camera there he sees it all the time you're just maron night  i'm just a guy passing through yeah yeah it's hard for them to get juiced when i'm sitting there too  it's like if tom cruise is here tomorrow in this seat what do i expect out of this guy  the most important moment right then and there it's so important to you and then them it's like 
[00:34:00]  tuesday exactly who you on with you know uh i don't can we look it up yeah i always like to  check on wednesday uh but you know it was it was a pretty good experience but that's that's true man  because like you get done and you're like huh huh and then it's just people cleaning up you know it's  like another day no it was my day that was my day it was very big for me can you step aside we got  to put the bands got to go in you're looking at your segment the same way with the same way they  looked at the monologue yeah don't matter segment two like okay maron's segment was good but segment  three we got it it's just one of five segments for tuesday exactly to you it's your life you got 
[00:34:30]  jamie foxx okay backstreet boys backstreet boys top 10 yeah they'll be there for the top all right  then you got the mark maron i'm on after jamie and then what's the last thing wale huh wale who's  that he's a performer he's like a rapper oh it's okay all right gonna pull in the new audience yeah  there you go yeah yeah cuts out of your demo a little bit but you know jamie i i uh i'm sure  he knows you the only experience i have with jamie is uh i you know i saw him in the like the 
[00:35:00]  ambassador lounge at an airport and i think in austin and he looked hungover and tired and and i made  the choice not to bother him but i stared at him for a while good one yeah no so i don't know him at  all yeah i've never met him he used to be a funny guy yeah you know he's he's a very talented man that  guy comics don't usually like i had to do i was doing leno panels my second time i've only done  a couple times panel and i was supposed to be jenna fisher but she canceled yeah and they called  day of and they say look it's going to be bill maher and i'm like fuck another comic because you 
[00:35:30]  at the time it was mccain it was during the last 2008 so he was loaded up for bear that guy but i'm  like fuck man and they're because they knew what the topics i was going to discuss and they're like  well you know he's going to hit on mccain and he's going to hit on obama right so i'm like what the  fuck i have to restructure this but he was so good man like sitting next to him you don't know  what a guy's going to mark was he's a pro but he was really supportive like he wasn't a dick trying  to outdo he was having fun with it like comics are usually good to each other as long as there's  no fucking prior hatred there right so i'm sure jamie will be fine no he's but he's an actor now i 
[00:36:00]  mean i and he's also very funny but i mean he seems to be at some other level yeah you know i don't i  don't i wonder when the last time he did comedy really was been a while i think it's probably been a  long time yeah i'm just happy if i'm on the show with somebody who i know who they are one  and that i have some respect for it yeah yeah you know well i gotta go back to the lake thing for  you because you said nothing could nothing could hurt you in the lake okay i forgot i forgot for a  second my brother's a marine biologist and he just wrote that i did forget that for a second he just 
[00:36:30]  texted me he said uh i think it's uh pronounced musk musk lunge will take your arm off in a lake a  musk lunge so i just want to i want to google image musk lunge get that up there m-u-s-k-e-l  that should be the muskul part and then lunge l-u-n-g-e there's dice is that a replay i don't know  what's he in new york i think it's a replay i think i think they're on vacation yeah i think  they're on vacation all right google image this this is this thing will take your arm off in a 
[00:37:00]  lake there you go there you go dice in his sunglasses and knickers yeah yeah right and i  have a serious face he looks good yeah yeah there it is oh god there you go that's a monster  looks like a barracuda wow look at them teeth a big thank you to my brother sturgeon holy yeah oh i  didn't i didn't need to know that's in a lake it's a trout-a-cuda yeah yeah i didn't need to know  this yeah i kind of felt like lakes are were kind of a safe and he said that could take your arm off 
[00:37:30]  no problem he said no problem no problem look at the teeth on the fucking nice and big teeth let me  see that thing though look at that guy he looks like this just ate my child he does look disturbed  yeah he looks very scared boy out all over the dock that'll take your arm off musk lunge i hope  i'm pronouncing it right how do you spell it m-u-s-k-e-l-l-u-n-g-e to that from my brain by the  way uh well i got a text from my fiancee oh just woke up on the couch miss you so much 
[00:38:00]  oh she always falls asleep on the couch she doesn't like to go into bed without me  oh wow you got it you got it bad have you had it this bad i did years ago  that's all over i did years ago i'm actually yeah i feel more affection for the actual couch  but i did the people updated originally the sad thing is is like i never knew this this part of 
[00:38:30]  me i gotta be honest with you wow this is new what they but i'm not sure it's a good thing like the  last two wives i destroyed and drained right you know like i you know i i really didn't know the  difference between what i wanted and uh what they wanted you know like for me like i was just a  selfish angry fuck sure and i think there's something i'm trying to make up for here by overcompensating  to the point where i might as well be wearing a fucking apron all the time did you now have you  uh have you worked through all that like like you were married obviously and there were problems 
[00:39:00]  because of of well it can't just be one-sided i'm sure her but also yourself you seem to have  been dealing with a lot of issues and anger and stuff have you changed are you a different person  as far as those look yeah because like the thing is is like you would think not because of the  washington thing uh-huh but that doesn't happen much the washington thing the washington incident  yes but but no we're going we're going we're going to counseling like i've learned that for me  like uh i i think like date three or four should be couples counseling wow yeah right in no but uh 
[00:39:30]  but no we started going because uh you know i couldn't get my wrap my brain around having a baby  so we started to go for that here's the weirdest thing though man so my buddy who's a therapist he  recommends his therapist for us to go to couples counseling to work through stuff right so i go to  this guy and we both go and it's it's a good start and he says you know you know my wife is also a  therapist and you know we can see you together like you know if you want if he he said that jessica my 
[00:40:00]  fiance could see his wife and i could see him and then we could all meet together that's weird but  it makes sense but it is fucking weird yeah you're sort of like you know when you when we all meet  together it's sort of like a dinner party where there's no food and i'm losing money  you're paying the tab but there's this weird but what's going to be a secret though like what if  you say something to him in confidence and all of a sudden it comes out with the four of you well  you sign a weird thing like they're like there's definitely a team thing because every time we go 
[00:40:30]  you know especially if we meet with both of them you know she's already made him the enemy  so but i think that's kind of the genius of it like you know it's like he doesn't get me at all  and i'm like oh really i don't know if i think he's i told him some stuff so uh but i don't know  what they talk about you know together like i'd like to think we leave and they sit there and go  all right here's the angle right right but i i don't fucking know but i'm not look i'm not you know  yeah there's some things i have to assume what do you have to sign this weird well you got to say  that they can talk about you guys oh okay like you know that it's a collective thing like they're  going to always stop breaking doctor patient confidentiality right with the two of them yeah you know so you 
[00:41:00]  guys leave forget about it they're probably like they are doomed they are fucking doomed yeah there's  a huge problem there oh you think he's bad wait till you find out what the fuck she's oh yeah they do  this they're probably they probably talk about it while they're fucking and like it's the only way  they could get off it's like discussing other couples misery there was one point where like you  know like they were she was talking and i was starting to steam man oh and then like in like you 
[00:41:30]  know you got to let them talk and i'm like oh that's fucking ridiculous yeah and then like  literally you know i don't remember who was guiding the question but the wife and the therapist couple  she goes this isn't going well and i'm like you mean you don't have a plan someone's got to have a  plan because i'm about to fucking leave oh so so you know i didn't leave yeah but like okay so  but the anger thing is better you know we are we're we're not right we're not doing that you're not  things are better angry the x y thing is done you know i wrote the book there's stuff in there 
[00:42:00]  you know i get that book like for me was a purging like my father's not talking to me  oh wow why yeah yeah i think i threw him under the bus a little what'd you say about that objected to  everything oh really well yeah because like well you know like i was doing shows and stuff like  my father has never paid attention i don't even think he fucking listened to the podcast and he's been  on three of them oh shit like i didn't tell him he was on but who cares right so but the thing was  is that when he started to get wind that the ifc show had a character in there based on him that i 
[00:42:30]  that was a bipolar kind of guy but it was judd hirsch i mean i tell you arguably a better father  but uh you know but he got wind of it like he and then obviously i start getting these emails so i  told him i said you know there's a couple episodes with the dad character but i went easy and you know i'm  not you know he was concerned that i would reveal certain things that i wouldn't do it but you know  i don't think you know the bipolar thing is yeah it's not a big secret i mean like my friend mark  spitz says it's like it's like diabetes everyone's fucking bipolar right plus also a fictional slash 
[00:43:00]  real character right right there was a lot of fiction to it but yeah but so he got wind of that  and he got started getting nervous right so about a week before the show goes on i get this call  he's like so what'd you do wait i mean you know what'd you say on the show he's like it's gonna be  fine he goes what what channel is it on and i go it's on ifc he goes no one gets that right i don't get that  but not even thinking it was an insult he was like i'll be all right because no one will see it  so then like the commercial start running i get an email he's like you know a lawyer friend saw the  commercial and you know i'm not going to go that route but i'm just saying that you know maybe we 
[00:43:30]  like he he wanted to negotiate something right your dad yeah you're like no no he wanted he said i  might sue you right basically but then it got all crazy he was just freaking out because he's like he's  crazy he's a megalomaniacal guy so he thought you know it was all about him and then all of a sudden  he started paying more attention to me in that week than he ever had my entire life he had a  google search on me he was like sending me emails going you know i just read the thing from 1997  very interesting like he oh wow yeah he felt like you know like i gotta i gotta see how he's gonna 
[00:44:00]  take me on so he watched and did everything is he self-centered yeah he's self-centered he's bipolar  and you know he's completely narcissistic and i think like he i think he just saw me as a limb  you know like a limb that got away like that's my other hand wait can i can i stop for a second  what kind of relationship did you guys have what kind of father was he just give us the basics here  well when you were growing up he was a guy that uh was very self-involved he was a doctor so you know  he was always out you know but uh you know when he was around everything sort of revolved around 
[00:44:30]  whatever thing he was doing whether it was rage or whether it was you know hey let's go skiing  it's very weird when you have a manic depressive father because you know when they plan it they're  excited but the vacation might be sad wow we're going to yosemite and then like weeks later you're  in yosemite i don't want to live it sounded like a good idea oh my god but uh that'd be a horrible  vacation i knew there was a reason why i liked you but i got i got a mom oh very similar very similar 
[00:45:00]  shit yeah it's weird she's got ocd and other things going on i don't know but it's always about  her right right so always always now i wrote this book and like i'm reading it see i want to write  a book but i'm waiting for the day that she dies yeah you should just write it and then she dies you  have a final chapter well i think that maybe you can kill her while she's alive  emotionally she's aware enough that she knows that you know there will be some kind of book  eventually yeah i mean and still got to write a book and i want to write a separate book and 
[00:45:30]  but she's aware but she's sort of hinted like could you maybe yeah wait till you know i you know but i  know i'm not around yeah yeah i know that i feel bad because i'm not talking to him like he's not  talking to me i'm sorry i didn't know no no no no you didn't really oh is how how much older is he  than you it's just a few years just basic yeah no he's like uh what is he's like 75 maybe yeah  yeah relatively young but in my mind i went easy on him but it was still pretty gnarly because you  know because it's hard when you write memoir stuff it's like this is my life there are other people 
[00:46:00]  involved in it you know how much what was the story that got him he just i don't even know if he  read it you know he talked to my brother and he claims that he didn't read it he hasn't watched  the show or anything else but uh you know i put one of his uh crazy emails in there and uh you know  i told the story about uh you know uh you know about uh his father's funeral that i was at you  know and something he did and just you know i i think i feel a little guilty but you know i i feel  good about it because something you know there's part of me that thinks like this had to happen you 
[00:46:30]  know now he knows i'm a separate person and now he knows that you know maybe who i gotta call him  i gotta call the guy because you know when you do something there's part of me that thinks like  you know when you take you do something and you realize like oh fuck there's no putting that back  right yeah that's done do you did your brain ever slow down i know we've asked you over the years  yeah yeah it does because there's always something going on in your head how do you get it to slow  down and just just like fucking chill yeah just lock in on porn sometimes porn yeah and it shuts down 
[00:47:00]  everything else that's going on kind of because you're a brilliant comic and one of the reasons  you really are and one of the reasons you always got shit going on in your head yeah but it's always  about me and sometimes i think that's draining yeah like i recently i've hit this wall where i'm  doing the podcast i'm doing my stand-up i'm like i gotta start thinking you know watching television  or something yeah i don't know how much crisis i can generate i was on stage in buffalo and i had 
[00:47:30]  this moment where i'm like i am so sick of hearing about myself i can't fucking take it anymore and i  said that to the audience i started a bit and i'm like i can't do this and they're looking at me and  most of them are my people and i'm like i don't know what we're going to do right now and they're  like what the fuck is happening and for like 45 seconds i'm like just wait this out just wait it  out that's awesome i would have loved and they're just like sitting there but luckily you know now  you know enough people are familiar with me where they're like he does this sometimes but uh but like 
[00:48:00]  i was like all right all right all right and then i sort of i just locked into talking about the  buffalo wings or something but i'm just tired of it there are times where i envy seinfeld like it  must be so nice because you obsess over yourself or i obsess over myself must be so nice to just look  at everything else and find them interesting right like i used to do politics i used to do  everything at some point i'm like you know none of that matters because i'm the problem  so let's talk about me as if i'm a country all right and uh and now i'm getting to that point 
[00:48:30]  where i'm like exhausted it's exhausting it's very exhausting to always have to find new things to not  only talk about but find the twist in and make funny and make interesting right it's a very tough  thing to do i got to start looking at other stuff like the kardashian problem you know yes  once in a while something else is interesting and it's fun i'm out of the dialogue i literally  am on so consumed on twitter with fucking you know you know my my shame parade on twitter you  know engaging you do it too but i mean you seem to have more fortitude with it but you know i i don't 
[00:49:00]  get like i don't think i got the news about paula dean until i saw your fucking twitter feed i'm  like did something happen you know and i have to go over there and like get caught up like i'm that  detached yeah you need to like i gotta watch the news a little bit what do you think of paula dean  what do you think of that whole situation well she's a little ignorant and a very insensitive  but it's something she did 30 years ago man no i mean it's a i think it's going to take a long time  for for it wasn't even that bad what she did for me yeah for people like her to culturally sort of 
[00:49:30]  grow up i don't think that she hates black people i don't think that she's a racist i just think she  comes from a different time yeah yeah yeah wow yeah that's what i think i think i can't get enough  for the tightrope guy oh that guy who's gonna be on our show tomorrow by the way nick will end it  will be in studio yeah i'll be in here tomorrow you see the tape across and then a clap while he  walks yeah apparently jesus did it yeah right you saw it right i did yeah that was amazing to watch  i don't know how the fuck they do it thank you lord thank you jesus but the sad thing about something 
[00:50:00]  like that is that if he did fall off people have been like well you know it'd be a better show  what do you think was gonna happen imagine imagine if his mantra that's what we're all half waiting  for right yeah oh yeah completely but his mantra is jesus i love you thank you for the wind  imagine if his mantra was eat a bag of shit fuck your mother's cunt you piece of garbage  it was all my inner dialogue that's pretty amazing shit though but new york city shut him  down we're not gonna deal with his crap no i think bloomberg sort of like in new york in general 
[00:50:30]  like do we need to have problems we don't need to have right yeah yeah there's enough shit going on  do we have to have like you clutter the streets yeah we don't have to import problems you know like  between the towers he did that completely yeah he just yeah he just said before but that was in the  days before you know like security go up with your fucking equipment and like no one stopped  him he had he was bringing a whole tightrope into the twin towers no one stopped him no arrow they 
[00:51:00]  started with an arrow and then they whatever i saw the documentary it was wonderful that's no one  city would do the tightrope thing would be buffalo bring it back around if you could find a building  that buffalo is begging for why did he do the falls well they did the falls oh they did he did he did the  falls but yeah they forced him to wear a safety uh wire oh i love that it was on abc but i'm telling  you i think buffalo i had ted's hot dogs excellent i had them can i tell you something what go back  to niagara falls in the winter when the whole thing's frozen is that great holy fuck it's really 
[00:51:30]  all frozen the whole thing free so no boat you just walk out there can you walk on the water  not the whole thing but i mean the falls itself is frozen the water's still coming down behind it  obviously yeah yeah yeah the outer shell it's a rush man it's a rush did you go right to the side  yeah yeah we were on the boat we're on the no i'm up top where you see the water and right at that  fucking corner right i have to fight the urge to jump yes isn't that weird but bad you don't have that  if i'm on a high building i think about it you're like i think my mind says right yeah i think most 
[00:52:00]  people have that right no you don't but you think like i really the sad thing about me is i think if i  were hanging off a building that like in my mind would be like it's easier to let go wow like to  climb back up and they're like oh because then wow it's just there's some part of it's like just  just let go it's funny that's the exact opposite reaction i have uh for everything in my life that's  in turmoil and that's the that's the proper reaction just let go the only time you think of  that is on a building oh mark man that podcast is terrific yes you're still going strong oh it's

[00:55:30]  ask anybody about their past in alaska you know like you just get this yes they're there for  something yeah they're definitely running it's called she'll kill charlie's it's like a famous  place up there and the last time i was up there there's a cover bar it's a well it's a series of  bars all together and they have showrooms where they do nice so last time i was there they were  like they told me in advance they're like we're a little short-staffed uh bouncer wise so just watch  your own back and the reason is because two of the guys were on probation because they killed a  guy in the parking lot and another dude was having surgery because he had his ear bitten off 
[00:56:00]  by a customer in the same week at alaska yeah yeah so it's pretty great like well how long is the  flight first of all oh like 12 hours 12 hours just for the weekend for the week you gotta be gonna go  for the week they kind of get your the reason they find it agreeable to do they like really work  yeah like i have a show every night for seven days and and and every night is is every day is  every night too right isn't it uh still dark uh there i think yeah it's gonna be i think now is 
[00:56:30]  the period where it's gonna be a few hours gets a little dusky and then a little light and then it  just it's dark again why did you come back here instead of just going right from la because i hate  la so much that i had to get it out of my system like i had to spend a couple days in new york you  know how cold is it alaska i think it's in the 30s now or whatever oh that's it yeah well it's not  terrible it's so cold let me tell you no my favorite thing about that club is there's like  a little it's just a crazy place you know it's all like there's wood chips on the floor and puke 
[00:57:00]  everywhere and whatever it sounds cold to be honest it's great yeah yeah and there's a midget who  wears the door wears a tuxedo and he checks people through the metal detector and uh there's a little  sign by his little kiosk where he uh takes ids there's this grizzled like nom vet looking alaskan  dude with like a crazy eye and like a like a flak jacket and underneath it like handwritten  and a magic marker there's a photo of the guy and then it says do not let him in he is a murderer  oh wow like that's what they do to murderers in alaska like get out of here murderer you know like 
[00:57:30]  you should have thought of that before you murdered somebody there are laws it's awesome yeah there  is like i i've watched some of those shows like the alaska state trooper show yeah where it's like  one trooper has to cover 18 million square miles of shit and and uh the the ice road trucker guys  and all that yeah it's just a place that if you're there you did something where you are not allowed  to be anywhere civilized anymore yeah like so they throw you up there walking down the street with a  shotgun like i was with uh the club owner we're walking down to go get lunch guy with a shotgun 
[00:58:00]  like just slung over his shoulder he's like hey good to meet you you know like that it's like  fucking deadwood it's amazing up there it's interesting is it modern or is it one of these  cities that looks kind of old uh yeah it looks old it does look old yeah i mean they have cell  phones and whatnot no i understand that but i mean but they're not building new shit for the most part  uh no not i want to go in new york because it's always weather beating places like that like the  hotel probably looks beaten up wherever you stay it's got to look oh you stay in a in a cabin 
[00:58:30]  it's awesome wow it's adventurous jimmy you should go should i  it's fun no i should build a hotel i'd be happy i have a hotel but i i and i if i like decided to  make a big deal out of it they probably would put me there but like i like the cabin that's cool yeah  a little adventure man you're gonna be there all week what do you do in between shows uh you can  like drive are you one of these comics that gets out of your room and does shit or you just kind of  hibernate yeah there's a place i think they closed it but it was the greatest it's like an hour outside 
[00:59:00]  of anchorage and this like 88 year old guy he's like this old german dude who uh has which by the  way is the perfect age to be hiding out i'd like to point out like 88 years old in alaska journey  uh exactly he uh he runs a wolf rescue like he just grabs wolves that were like hit by a car  and like nurses him back to health wow and then he has them in his backyard and the guy's got nine  fingers because a wolf took one of them literally and and he just walks you around the yard and like 
[00:59:30]  tells you which ones you're allowed to pet and which ones are going to kill you you know like  do they bite him or no no no not well i mean they have in the past like he's all scarred up and  whatever but for the most part like he has like a rapport with the wolves you know they're the ones  he he his his farm is what like movies use so like wolves you see in movies tend to be from this  guy's place you know right but and he gets the hybrids right like people who think they could raise  one of these animals and realize holy fuck they are wild beasts yeah yeah so they they ditch uh the 
[01:00:00]  animals and then a guy like this he takes them he takes them yeah and he's got like supposedly the  hybrids are the worst when you're trying to fucking mix the two breeds yeah he's got like this patter  too like that you know because it's like a tourist place like you know the anchorage tourism will send  you up there like oh you gotta go see this guy right so you go up there and like but his he's 88 so  it's like you can see him like going through the motions of the jokes that he has in his little rat-a-tat  but he's like lost it because he's so and he'll be like okay you go ahead you put that one but not 
[01:00:30]  that one no wait it's this one but not the place he literally fucks it up and you're like i'm not  you have nine figures they made the mistake yeah it's amazing are you a jewish  wow yeah that's a lot of uh alcoholics up there too apparently yes indeed the drinking is um like all  you can do up there actually i think this is around the time of year because i was there once before  like sometime in march and that's when it starts to thaw and every day in the newspaper there's like  three new dead bodies oh because they're it's under the snow yeah exactly right they just like find a 
[01:01:00]  crumpled up guy with a whiskey bottle in his hand you know what i mean like just under a snow bank on  a sidewalk that they didn't see before wow that's wild how much snow do they get i mean i know alaska's  snow but i mean how much do they get in the winter it's fucking light it's not i'm not a meteorologist  do you know the answer to that oh man i don't know why i'm asking you the fucking yeah who was  the mayor of juno you guys doing a gig what a cunt i am now the annual precipitation i know 
[01:01:30]  it's amazing how somebody can become an expert in my eyes i'm wearing a sweatshirt that says alaska  so you're like oh this guy yeah what's their biggest export jesse you're really into alaska  you're playing there you got a hoodie on it's a coincidence because i just literally moved back  to new york after three like last night i got in and so i just threw on the only but i do feel like  the guy at the concert with the band yeah yeah exactly you got kind of a fucking alaska well we  got to ask you about the oscars how'd you feel it went for some i thought it went great like yeah yeah 
[01:02:00]  and everybody who's like in the industry like anybody who's a humorist or comic or whatever like  they all get it it's just like the fat housewives that hated it you know  and he basically said i'm done go find someone else yeah well he said that before like oh really  before the oscars were even but he brought in the numbers they were looking for the younger demos and  he brought them in right yeah he's exactly where they were looking for growth one of his tweets was  uh perfect he said it's like the kobayashi maru from uh star trek uh yeah uh rathacon you you do it 
[01:02:30]  it's a no-win scenario because if you do well some people like you but then some people hate you  right uh i think he did a great job he looks the part yeah he sounds great i thought he was funny  and he had some good jokes that didn't seem like the ones that you just you know here's the writer  put it on the teleprompter let this guy that doesn't know how to deliver it deliver it uh i  thought he sounded great and of course the one i knew came from jesse i called it which one it's  pretty sweet the john wilkes booth one the one that was yours that's gotta be that's fucking 
[01:03:00]  i've been here he's jesse's written enough stuff for me and i've watched him enough to know that  and no one else would write that for the oscars but this fucking shit no great joke let me ask you  about that so john wilkes booth trended worldwide on twitter as a result of that joke i'm so proud of  that now let me ask you about that so you present that joke to him were you a little worried  no no no he's pretty edgy like yeah yeah i guess it was just trying to it was more like we all  collectively were trying to find the line you know yeah yeah because it was a joke there but was he 
[01:03:30]  really worded yeah was he really excited like okay this is it this is the one yeah well actually i  know i didn't even know necessarily that he was gonna pick like you know i just churned out stuff  and threw them into the void like just into this giant joke bank and you know he was the one who  called through them and picked them so how many were of yours were used uh i don't know maybe  like 15 something like that somewhere look at them casually i don't know 15 of my jokes were heard by  a million people but the thing is like i don't know for sure because i was backstage the whole time 
[01:04:00]  so i wasn't were you writing on them were you also writing as the show was going on no like that was  the intention that's why he wanted us all backstage but it's such an enormous machine that once it  starts there's no like so you saw everybody you saw everybody walk back oh yeah yeah you're just in the  way like i'm just in liam neeson's way the whole time you know he's like trying to get around me  and you know like i ended up like i was standing on uh sushi in his hair yeah yeah who's the one with  the shovel face uh the chick uh oh uh uh not renee zellweger the other one the one who looks just 
[01:04:30]  like reese witherspoon yes reese witherspoon reese witherspoon yeah with her square weird head  with her weird chin i was like standing on her dress you know like just shit like that happens the  whole time like wow you know i was waiting to go to the bathroom and michael douglas is clearing  his fucked up throats behind me like waiting to piss you know like that kind of thing the whole  time you can't get any pictures back there right no it would have been like well i see i don't know  how you do it like you do it all the time like i just i don't know the protocol so back there i 
[01:05:00]  might not backstage you could look weird maybe with one like if deniro was back there i would  have asked deniro definitely one i would have been willing to get thrown out for  did you go to any of the parties or no yeah yeah well i got to go to the governor's ball which  is like the big one you know wait what else about the oscars themselves though uh it seemed to go  pretty smoothly but like that's the thing is like we were back like with the with like the roast or  whatever you know they just come backstage you can just pitch out a joke like oh you know because  somebody said something then and that was why we were there just like in case tarantino said nigger 
[01:05:30]  or whatever like that was just the assumption that we'd all be there to cover for that because  you see it like he looked like he was giving a drunk best man speech oh yeah his tie was all  loose swaying around like we were totally like it's coming you know but but he's already in place  by the time so there's like nothing for us to do other than just kind of just uh look at the stars  yeah and like try not to bother anyone which was the one uh person you saw where you were like holy  fuck that's that's a fucking uh huge celebrity well charlie sarin is like that hot in person 
[01:06:00]  yeah she's amazing inches from her yeah yeah i've seen her in restaurants and it's like i just want  to walk up and go look i know you don't know me but i kind of love you excuse me we we saw charlie  starin where wasn't she she was the one on our couch at anyw before she was famous before she was  really really famous yeah yeah she was hanging with the guy from uh we told the story a bunch of times  uh uh the jumper song the fucking suicide song the fucking help oh the drowning pool no no no no uh  yeah yeah third eye blind third eye blind thank you and we and we were we were pussies back then 
[01:06:30]  because uh the third eye blind guy who was kind of a dick to us by the way so fuck him he basically  told us like look man i don't really want you bringing up that yeah she's here because i think  she just made uh which one devil's advocate or something oh that's a big one all right she was  yeah but they didn't know but she wasn't a household name yet right she was on our way right and he  basically said you know i don't really want you bringing up that i brought her here and she just 
[01:07:00]  sat on the couch all innocent and just fucking looking did you get to hug her no no i didn't  i almost i almost did anyway you should have just put your arms out like come on you know you want to  see you again phony hollywood oh my god there was so much of that shit just like i just overheard  somebody just some douche like hollywood looking asshole just like who doesn't love hugh jackman  everybody loves he like like to hugh jackman like talking about somebody in the third person  to them is such a dumb hollywood thing to do oh my god jesse jesse makes a point yeah yeah yeah right 
[01:07:30]  like yeah you know that's why everybody loves jimmy you know that's brutal um no one who was  depressing to see it was renee zellweger she is aged man right i know it happens to everybody but  she's had a rough couple years or something she's almost unrecognizable as meryl streep didn't see her  renee zellweger oh i thought she looked okay no but she looked a lot fucking different man right  yeah she's cool though i actually had to take her on a tour of the comedy cellar once for some movie 
[01:08:00]  or whatever and i don't even know why they called me but the seller called me and we're like hey would  you bring renee zellweger around so i did was she hot at the time yeah yeah yeah yeah i always had  a little thing jerk you off in the car no she did not jerk you off what the hell i think i'd be  to be honest with you i'd be a little self-conscious if she gives you she has that like  lemon face you know like that it would make it look like what's wrong with my dick  well she had to keep getting fat and skinny for that bridget jones diary shit it's got to take  its toll on you that's her from the oscars yeah she's pretty hot but when she was on the act this 
[01:08:30]  is from the red carpet we're looking at a picture when she was good but when she was on the oscars  doing her little thing she looked a little haggard did you see meryl streep backstage i did not that  would have been cool yeah she looked rather old no like the people that i ended up like smoking a  cigarette next to robert downey jr like four different times like because i kept sneaking  out to go have a smoke and it's the same place that they would go out and seek out really yeah  yeah uh who's who's smoking these days as celebrities well pretty much robert downey jr  just me you know talk to him just like yeah i don't want to be that guy because a lot of times 
[01:09:00]  too like in airport smoking lounges and none of you guys smoke right i know you guys used to but  yeah people feel this need to chat with each other when they're having a cigarette and it's  always like they don't have anything so it's like about smoking it's the lamest fucking just  because you're having a cigarette yeah you're in the smoking people be like this is ridiculous right  you know like they want me to join some fucking coalition yeah exactly right no you should have 
[01:09:30]  said that he would have said what do you mean you would have said the fact that blacks were allowed  in here i like the fact that he applauded the uh rihanna joke though that was cool what was i  didn't see that moment there was like a chris brown joke about django being so brutal that it's like  a date date movie yeah yeah that was not mine but it's a great joke but like and it got like a big  like oh yeah fucking and and uh fucking you know robert downey jr was the only one loudly 
[01:10:00]  applauding it good for him yeah yeah i thought it was nice i love robert downey jr you he's fucking  an amazing actor and he's just he's just done everything to fuck up you can't you can't not  like this huge comeback yeah you should have mentioned how great his ass was in fucking less  than zero like you know when you were julian your fucking chiefs were amazing what a horrendous  scene though i know oh god i had a bunch of jokes like were too much that you couldn't but  like kovanzane for example you know she was who kovanzane wallace that nine-year-old  you know she's nine but she was six when they made that movie so that means she spent a third 
[01:10:30]  of her life involved with this movie coincidentally robert downey jr spent a third of his life in a  whiskey bottle like stuff like that but they were like yeah i thought it was funny yeah you should  have just oh did you write the onion joke for seth and they took it no no i did not but that is  goddamn ridiculous though especially because all of those like you know uh false uh infuriated 
[01:11:00]  people who just are uh-huh rushing to her defense now now as a result kovanzane's mom has to explain  what a cunt is to a nine-year-old you know what i mean like if they hadn't made such a big deal out  of that joke then it wouldn't have gotten back to the little girl but now for sure it has you know  yeah so her mother has to say look it's just what your father calls me i never understand that  shit because you end up making it so much worse by bringing it up yeah yeah i would have never  known i don't exactly i don't read the onion on a regular basis no i don't follow him on twitter 
[01:11:30]  yeah but you know the rest of the news had to go with and say listen to this this is so fucking  outrageous right jesse so i got one question so what brought you back down to earth after the oscars  the one thing where you're like oh do they do they even understand i wrote for the oscars and now  you're yeah well i have this uh i got it like this amazing parking spot like right in the uh dolby  theater like there's 30 40 people that had parking spots and i was one of them giant sign that says 
[01:12:00]  reserved for jesse joyce academy awards right this big which i stole by the way nice it should happen  yeah yeah yeah but the car i drove was a 92 hyundai elantra it's and it's it's from this place  called renoreck in la yeah yeah yeah it's fucking amazing like i look like a weed dealing pizza  delivery guy showing up at the oscars you know like just it's just all smashed in and the front  headlights burnt out why did you go to renoreck i know they're cheaper but it's like renting a car  for because i was there for three months oh three months all right total cost a thousand dollars 
[01:12:30]  that's beautiful it's great so like as long as you're confident enough in the fact that  you gotta you don't care and you can beat the shit out of it no matter right for three months  for this well no because i was working on season two with a burn with jeff ross that show you know  jimmy did last season so uh so yeah so i was i worked i did one and two and then the oscars right  after that so i was stuck out there for a while so yeah so i just hop in my shit box and you know  immediately after the oscars like that was kind of an interesting i had to pull up to seth's party 
[01:13:00]  and this fucking like and it just you know like lamborghini everybody else it's like a line of  lamborghinis and then you're a piece of shit yeah where'd you stay uh i rented a like a little studio  apartment in silver lake which is the worst place on earth it's like the belly of the beast you know  it's like the la part of la it's kind of like williamsburg but sunny air you know it's just awful  bearded shitheads hanging around right right and like everybody's in stupid show business which is 
[01:13:30]  what i hate about there you know is that you can't avoid it you know like every coffee shop every  time you go to make any kind of transaction you just know that the person but has a headshot  and they're gonna fail you know what i mean like you just know they're a fucking failing actor you  know it's just sad like you can walk around new york all day long and never run into anybody else  in show business it's like i think you could do that in this room  we laugh because it's true  that's hurtful jimmy 
[01:14:00]  i used to date this girl who uh this sounds bullshit but it's not i dated vladimir putin's  translator briefly oh wow and uh yeah i met her at mcsorley's that shitty bar yeah yeah yeah yeah i  met her what because she she was his guy or uh he had like five simultaneous translators and one of  them she was the one who would do stuff at the u.n when he was here right so she'd fly in and do that  and then she just went to mcsorley so i met her there so i met her that night and then technically 
[01:14:30]  speaking i fucked her in russia because she took me back to the u.n plaza one oh okay so i had a  one-night stand and i've never been to russia but i had a one-night stand there yeah wow  and uh she was hot yeah yeah yeah she's pretty great and uh uh and then you know whatever we  dated off and out for a little which is every time she's in town but the point is is that she  is a simultaneous translation is what she does professionally for a living the best  case scenario that you can imagine to get like the top of their game simultaneous translators 
[01:15:00]  75 accuracy wow that's the best you can possibly hope for isn't that shocking and terrifying  what does simultaneous translator mean that's when we're negotiating something you and i  and but you don't speak english and so as a result you have your guy and i have my guy  and they translate what is being said as you're talking you know instead of like translating  later on translating a speech yeah it's translating actual negotiations so 75 percent is the best 
[01:15:30]  earpiece things yeah yeah that's what that is blah blah blah blah blah blah so what languages  did she speak uh like that's the five greek and french no they speak like five in the u.n or  something and so it's like english french uh russian chinese and whatever the fifth one i don't  remember it's a smart broad yeah but speak that many languages yeah and fluently and understand them  and kind and translate them quickly to fucking vladimir putin but can you imagine like if seven if  25 of what we were talking about was lost like how fucking nonsensical that happens every day 
[01:16:00]  nuclear weapons yeah yeah it's very important you want to read our twitters it happens every day  they only catch about 60 of what we're saying right accurately and you can only do it for two  hours a day apparently because it's so taxing on your brain or three hours wow like yeah so that's  her whole shift is like three and she's done she uh rest her head wow man apparently because you  have to be listening in one language and immediately just yeah out in a different one you know  so it's a really complicated thing amazing that can even be done pretty amazing yeah and you know 
[01:16:30]  and you know they get it wrong once oh yeah obviously 25 percent of the time yeah she actually while we  were kind of seeing each other she uh caused an international incident oh which was the hottest  thing ever to me yeah yeah that's pretty good apparently happens constantly like they'll point  like apparently what happened was they were talking with the chinese about how many nukes are on the  russian chinese border or whatever and she uh mistranslated the number oh so that's a big one  it was off by like 20 000 or something like that that's big and uh the chinese like literally just 
[01:17:00]  took off that got up and walked away like they walked out of the meeting oh man so there was a  thing in the new york times it was like the chinese left the table at a nuclear disarmament  discussion and it caused a big and then like it happens all the time i bet you if you look at like  you know buried eight pages deep the next day it's like it was a mistranslation yeah yeah like that'll  always happen so but you're just fucking looking going yeah you fucking troublemaker yeah yeah yeah  fucking it's pretty great fucking fuck you you troublemaker he's got great stories why'd you stop  seeing her because i started because a long distance relationship no because i'm an idiot because i fell 
[01:17:30]  in love with a fucking cocktail waitress in kentucky all right that's why so she came from russia to see  me and i bailed on oh man really i feel bad about that well oh she flew in and you're already seeing  somebody else well i wanted to it was like i'd started dating the other broad so i didn't want  to like hurt either of their feelings yeah when she got here good god you're that guy she got here i  had to go like sorry we can't hang out so then she fucked my roommate that's what happened wow 
[01:18:00]  oh yeah so wait so you why'd you let her fly in instead of just calling her because i'm a fucking  coward that's why you went to fly all the way from russia i didn't know how to tell her she's coming in  from cleveland jersey or something i didn't know how to tell her oh man i had to go through the tunnel  yeah yeah yeah yeah who had her bang uh what the kentucky waitress okay you made the right move  yeah who had a meteor pussy meteor uh i would probably the russian actually oh boo jesse well you you and 
[01:18:30]  i think have different probably probably as far as that jimmy norton meaty pussy thing it's beyond me  literally i don't get it if you said the russian girl had a meaty pussy but she lost her head in a  fucking hedge clipping accident i'd still take her plus you banged her a bunch of times you're probably  done with it yeah not ready you know why that was exciting though is that somewhere in a basement  filing cabinet in the kremlin there has to be a dossier about me oh yeah you don't think so yeah  because i was two people away from the russian president you know what i mean like at some point 
[01:19:00]  they had to watch my live at gotham yes you know i mean like like a couple of ex-kgb dudes was like  yo who is this just sign me in and find out who this is what does he do i don't know he gives  serious talk he gives very boring lectures motivational speaking  it is motivational speaking about cocaine apparently i don't know yes he stopped talking  and the people just look they look at him uh very strange oh man so oh yeah they had to sign 
[01:19:30]  you into the russian consulate right yeah yeah and then i went to geneva once to hang with her  she because she had a lot of money so she flew me over to hang at the u.n in geneva  what a piece of shit he fucking made makes her fly did you apply your business class  no she didn't but it's fine coach yeah good for you for a kentucky uh cocktail waitress and  how did that work out uh it was interesting like i got to i set up a show in geneva so i did stand up  there no i mean how did it work out with the kentucky broad  oh i dated her for a couple years so it actually did work so it's a real thing yeah yeah so you 
[01:20:00]  went to geneva coach and uh you set up a gig yeah and then uh and so i i went to the u.n in geneva  she like signed me in there too and and i went to the cafeteria and like had lunch with her colleagues  colleagues yeah and i've like never been like less interesting in my entire you know what i mean  yeah because they're all like literally like working on like rwandan genocide prosecutions  you know like these lawyers who are like prosecuting dictators you know and then it's  like yeah this guy fucking wrote a fucking joke about seth mcfarland's cock that went pretty well 
[01:20:30]  in minot north dakota like that's what i'm doing wow that's fucking amazing to me that you ditched  the russian shit well we were just talking about what a fucking terrified child i was i know you  were too right uh yeah yeah terrified adult but i would watch scary movies right we're all very  excited here we just got the uh blu-ray uh copy of all the uh nightmare on elm street movies yeah  uh so we were talking about and apparently you do not like scary movies i don't like i my fear as a 
[01:21:00]  child like when there's so many evolutions like yeah freddy krueger was the first thing i would and  i never even saw the movie it was just the box cover you never saw the original nightmare dude i i  like literally saw a picture on the box cover and i didn't sleep for like a month so like there's no  way i could have seen the actual movie zero chance and then uh i then i went through a phase  where i was terrified that my parents were gonna get kidnapped while i was sleeping i don't know  what the fuck that was about but i was like sure that so i literally had this thing where like they 
[01:21:30]  would put me to bed and then i would have to tell them to uh make noise out in the living room when  they were up so like so that i knew that they were still there you know what i mean that no one  you're afraid of being alone right right so like every now and again they just bang on something so  i could like fall asleep so i knew that like oh they're still and they would do that they would  right doing that my fucking irrationality gained a new level of sophistication and i was like well  wait a minute whoever steals my parents would have the foresight to just leave a tape recording  device of them making noise in the living room oh man so i used to then that didn't once i once 
[01:22:00]  that thought creeped in my head then like there was nothing that i was like they might still be gone  i don't know like safe they could have been stolen hours ago and i've been listening to this  recording so i'd have to like still get out of bed every like fucking hour and a half and like  go out weirdo i know what a cock block i know your fucking dad's trying to get his hog sucked  you popping around the corner well i don't think they do a lot of time i just peer around the  corner just like all right cool they're still here can i go back yeah did you just need white noise of 
[01:22:30]  some sort or i love that noise i don't know i just make it white yes you're right  no i just went through a phase yeah where i was like afraid that my parents were gonna get stolen  from i don't know what the fuck that was about to hole and do you still not like horror movies  no i still don't watch them kenny won't watch him either like he really won't watch him and i'm  amazed and he's a big galoot yeah he is a lummux i don't it's just a discomfort you know what i mean  like that's all like i don't like when the fucking you know like there's weird music i uh yeah i don't 
[01:23:00]  like getting jumpy i don't like slasher movies not because i i'm afraid of them or anything i just  don't find them really entertaining right i like i like a good scary movie um like you know where  where fucking those weird chicks are just in positions they're not supposed to be in crawling  on the ceiling so what about like shit just looks like yeah where some little girl like all the  yeah yeah john hinges for no better yeah very creepy yeah right yeah yeah little kids are always 
[01:23:30]  like you can't be here ah you know that's scary shit to me but i'll watch them yeah you know and  then and then i'll let go and go to go to bed and it's dark in the room and i'll maybe turn  the light always yeah yeah subject yourself i know i don't know why it's that fucking visceral  feeling that emotion horror movie oh are you about a guy with a knife and he just runs around going  you're dead i feel like i've seen similar sounds terrible 
[01:24:00]  the you're dead killer yeah and he just screams you're dead and he chases you  it's not a good movie well yeah uh well there was something that happened years ago of course um  i was uh i was going to take a shower uh right after watching psycho it was psycho was on tv and  uh decided you know you know take a shower i don't know i don't know why and uh my brother had sent my 
[01:24:30]  sister into the uh bathroom wearing a wig and uh holding a knife right and uh ripped the shower  curtain open and went and then because she was like i guess i don't know maybe six years old and  she goes  and i collapsed you were scared scared the shit out of me but she was a little six-year-old in a wig  a little girl yeah but it was uh it didn't matter yeah it could have been anything it was just that i 
[01:25:00]  was in the shower and i was i was petrified was this recently yeah that's very very frightening  equally scary for the six-year-old yes yeah i beat her with my penis  that's a good way to get punched in the face yes you know like scaring people is never like a good  like i've seen that go badly so many times oh jimmy is that you what holy shit literally smells  like dog shit in here your coffee oh god oh no that's you that was terrible he's acting wow 
[01:25:30]  oh my god yeah that you you should oh my god it's terrible i dropped this stinker wow  oh come on what are you doing you're gonna get us poisoned with the ozone thing is gone  worse than any scary movie exactly jimmy's asshole let's take it come on fucking hell laugh enjoy it  uh i've said plenty of times on this very program how oh don't you don't wave it toward me  why did you get away jimmy just did that so the listeners know he's still here yeah that's how i 
[01:26:00]  know i exist plenty uh plenty of times in this very program i've discussed how petrified scared i  i grew up i was in a constant state of fear yeah of everything and everyone yeah i was uh like a one  of those um yeah like a chihuahua just pissing on a coward coward one of those what do you call them  cowards yeah if if back back in uh what i call the day uh parents would just leave their kids in  the car when they run into the store to get something yeah just leave the fucking kids in 
[01:26:30]  the car sure so uh when that would have that would happen i would just be so scared we were going to  get stolen i thought we were going to get kidnapped and your parents were crying because they knew you  wouldn't and uh one time this um this guy that apparently knew my mom came over to the car  right to say hi to the kids so he knocked on the window i i just exploded in screams and crying  i was so scared and the guy like looked like oh my god what happened right he he didn't know what 
[01:27:00]  happened i thought he had come to to steal us right yeah now you've suddenly put him in like a  really awkward position in a parking lot yeah he's like grab you like stop screaming you be quiet  stop the police show up and shoot him in the head your little pants fell down while he was shaking  you his penis slipped into me yeah yeah if a child does something unusual around you that's a really  uncomfortable place to be you know i fucking uh i was doing this gig it's some awful like gary indiana 
[01:27:30]  or whatever i was in this like mega like one of those like uh complexes where there's like a holiday  inn like a the metroplex or whatever the fucking they have like events there or whatever and they  had one of those uh like toddler and tiara things going on oh god not the tv show but just a child  and so there was this like there were like all these like fucking dolled up six-year-olds wandering  around like it was so uncomfortable i know it's sometimes right  and uh so i go up to my i go up to my floor and there's like some twatty moms that they're like 
[01:28:00]  just chatting and they're ignoring this little girl who's wandering around in a fucking prom dress  sex and i'm going down the hall in my room and the little girl starts walking with me  a little whore and she yeah she's like you know like what's your name and whatever like she's  being a child great yeah and but it's like ah kid you better go back with your mom this is really  uncomfortable and so uh and i got my key in my hand right and we get i get to where my room is but  i'm like i don't want to go into my room i don't want this fucking child following me to my and i keep 
[01:28:30]  trying to flag down the twatty mom but she's not paying attention you know and so i got this little  girl who's just hey she's like uh she's like let me put let me use the key right i guess you know  because children are excited by the fucking whatever like it's like a swipe thing you know i don't know  she wants to do and i'm like no no no no kid and like i'm not yeah i don't need your fingerprints  on this key that's for sure so i find you headless in a bathroom somewhere i'm trying to hide it it's  like palmed in my hands right but she knows that it's there so she starts like trying to grab it  out of my hands holding hands in the hallway trying to drag her into your room she keeps yeah she's like 
[01:29:00]  grabbing it and i'm like the kid you got it and it's like okay this kid's gonna scream right  well it's like it's getting worse because it's like now she's gonna scream in the hallway and i can't  have that yeah so like i'm trying to get the mom yeah exactly right you be quiet just be quiet  yeah exactly you thought it was a chicken clucking  i don't want to kill you wow so so i like let go of the key she fucking puts the key in the door  and runs into my room and now i have like the door like the door's gonna close and that's my only key 
[01:29:30]  and now i'm thinking like i can't go down to the lobby because there's a fucking six-year-old in my  room so i have to like hold the door open with my long arm like as far as like and i'm like  flagging down the mom in the hallway like there's a your kid just came into my room and there's a  fucking six-year-old in a prom dress like sitting on my bed like it's the worst fucking like my brain  is on fire because i'm just so uncomfortable with this whole scenario and i finally like get the  dumb i'm like hey fucking i don't know what happened and so the mom comes rushing down and of 
[01:30:00]  course like she doesn't she's like i'm so like i was thrilled that she didn't blame me but at the  same time she like grabs her just like what the fuck is the matter with you and like takes her  yeah it was just i just went in and just like just laid on the my head was just fucking on fire  because i'll never uh i'll never she knew as the kid right i'll never put myself in a position like  that though where you're like alone i know but you would have just the opposite problem  she'd be inside trying to run out  no if there's a public bathroom and stuff and you walk in and you just see a kid in there 
[01:30:30]  turn right the fuck around and get out yeah that's it yeah the opian anthony channel presents  a very chipperson thanksgiving you guys know there's only 12 good comics at a time  more legendary appearances from our favorite stand-up comics coming up don't go it motherfucker  more memorable ona appearances from the biggest names in stand-up a very chipperson thanksgiving 
[01:31:00]  continues on the opian anthony channel yeah this next guy uh patten you know mr uh i know what i'm  talking about uh he starts off oh he talks about loving ona and breaking down the whole yakov thinner  adventure maybe you think that's funny but i got things to do uh he talks a lot about reading  moby dick now that's good reading that's good american reading to all this pornography and smut  i just want to just go to the job site make my living come home support my family have a dinner 
[01:31:30]  roll what's he up to well we're going to find out what patten oswald is all about we were having a  nice conversation oh yeah yeah he was talking about um an old clip from our show that uh i think his  brother gave him and he loved it patten how you doing man what's slapping him you want to tell  and uh what we're talking about because it's definitely worth mentioning on the air uh it's  the clip of you and someone combined it on youtube it's the clip of you guys dissecting uh um barry 
[01:32:00]  williams's branson show and then goes right into yakov's dinner adventure adventure i think i've  watched that i'm i'm not exactly probably like 10 times especially because that's my nightmare for  where my career right up of like okay you got to think about this crowd and what they because what  really is scary about that clip is what they're selling is for one night you get the you get to  have the world the way you want it which is nice yes quiet and slow yeah and it's nice remember the 
[01:32:30]  woman's like you kept the food hot and she goes i don't know how you did it and you realize these  probably what these people can afford is a lot of places where the food probably isn't hot they  don't cook it really well and there's nothing they can say about it they know they have no power  anymore so it's like for one night it's a world where the food is hot there's no blacks  all this night you get to have the world like it was in 1941 when you were still healthy right you 
[01:33:00]  weren't looking at death like that's all that is we might have to podcast that that is write it down  great um assessment of that and then the magnetic trays we were talking about and there was a reason  for the magnetic trays they found they realized if we get rid of the tables we can pack 200 more  people into this room and seat them and feed them like pigs literally and i think one of you guys  are saying yeah and when the show's over you know they just take a fire hose to the floor and tables 
[01:33:30]  and just wash it into a sluice gate probably at the bottom of the of the auditorium and they just get  the next round right the next five shows a day like get them in yes move move oh my god yeah yes and  then also the the care that my personal chef takes and as he's saying it there's footage of just mass  trays coming out with plastic covers to keep it hot like like the visual totally negates everything 
[01:34:00]  that he's bragging about my personal chef he totally slaves over this yes slaving over the frozen chicken  cordon bleu that he gets by the fucking like the shipping containers are out back full of you don't  think chef was making it all fresh i don't think so yeah and well it's it's weird that he says that  it's making it fresh and yet they show yeah a platoon of frightened renazuelans who are working  in his kitchen that are terrified of being hit like it is the most horrifying oh god that's oh 
[01:34:30]  that's so many it's one of our greatest discoveries ever i'm fascinated with branston that whole thing  that like uh uh they they we were watching that guy what's the name kirby the magician oh yeah and it  was like this horrible trying to look like vegas thing but the tricks just weren't good and and it  wasn't the glitz it was branson you know also you gotta you you watch it and realize oh wait this is 
[01:35:00]  9 30 in the morning this isn't rat pack stuff this is right right and then we're gonna have my nap  afterward and then three o'clock dinner and then we'll go to sleep and that's that's waiting for  so many of us i told pat yes if you enjoy that he has to do the joe piscopo one we did  where you came in that day and said you gotta see this showtime i just woke up in the middle of the  night open my eye and joe piscopo was on it was a new special that he had it was club piscopo it was 
[01:35:30]  called and it's like him going doodle you do uh just doing like like frank sinatra stuff  telling stories in between the uh songs this was recent yes oh yeah most recent showtime yes maybe  a year ago i oh this is just i was stupefied i was when i was in staten island i was i was telling  um opie that they he has a like he had it when i was there he had like a residency at some hotel 
[01:36:00]  oh he was doing like out on staten island which i thought that's kind of cool like he's out  like while you're in manhattan doing something out on staten island yeah joe piscopo is going up  right now and doing a show but yeah a whole show oh is that like on can i i just got xm radio  satellite 103 i got that station with which has you guys on it uh-huh yeah riding around la it  justifies all my anger eric's actually gonna uh burn a cd of the joe piscopo i would oh man 
[01:36:30]  it i think you would enjoy that if you like the wow the yakov slash barry well the yakov thing is  great because they match the visuals to everything yes i love that they're doing that adds to the  horror of what you're seeing like like as bad as your descriptions are all the visuals back up  every single thing you're saying yeah yeah i'm hoping someone denying it i'm hoping someone does  that with the happy days thing we did yesterday oh yeah because that'll do really well and discovered a  happy days episode where they handle the the racial issue yeah yeah it was tom bosley has a 
[01:37:00]  black friend it was one of the original ones it was not in front of the live studio audience it was  done on film it was one of the original ones and yeah he was going to be the best man at a black  guy's wedding and had the black guy at his house and they had the stereotypical neighbor come over  and go oh she's all like scared because he's a black guy we watched the whole episode yesterday  oh wow on this show well there's also that clip where you guys i can't believe i'm like it's like  i'm a nerd that won win a morning with opium and then remember that one episode that you did when you 
[01:37:30]  but there's this episode where you guys dissected and this is also on youtube the the uh the dudley  episode of uh and in which you you the line you added the line dudley's a goer  but then somebody there was a website i think it's college humor but or maybe another website  but they pointed out all those very special episodes where a kid is molested or someone is 
[01:38:00]  raped or someone has cancer overdoses yeah or overdoses those were live tapings for an audience  most of which had traveled from the midwest like we're going to go to la we're going to go see a show  and they've bought a ticket and they've sat there for four hours to watch a kid get raped  their big hollywood trip right ends with watching a show about a kid being molested they just wanted  to laugh yeah i thought you were saying they were the lucky audience and it was the best birthday i ever 
[01:38:30]  had yeah they just wanted to escape one of those shows like i want to see the show it's a comedy we all  laugh we watch every week yeah we watch it and they got to sit there for the audience that goes  oh that low like oh the other one time they hear arnold say what you talking about it's to a man  about to rape his friend in a fucking empty tub right what you talking about it's not the same  catchphrase isn't as fun right right yeah it's actually it's really what what you 
[01:39:00]  talking about yeah yeah we do like our anniversary we do like picking things apart on the show that's  fun the happy days one is the latest one that was that was yesterday it was fun fun to watch them  juggle the racial issue and uh and it was scary marshall style yes it was done so ham-handedly  you got a clip there just awful or no uh i have i'm just looking up to see what's out there's a 
[01:39:30]  four and a half hour youtube video which is the uh all parts the saga of you guys and joe piscopo  wow uh so if you have four are there visuals and stuff because i think there are some throughout  i think the next okay the next day we had him on the show yeah it was a trilogy  yeah yeah it's five parts iraq is saying and then you know then he started coming in  and he's getting girls pregnant all over the place we're like you stop he's an animal he's an animal we  love him yeah in the end we love the guy he loves throwing that seed around that piscopo seed yeah

[01:43:30]  and uh and he tells me where to go and i'm driving i'm like wait this isn't this isn't  this should be like a gated community right right and then he we pull i pull up to this house and and  and he's like hey what's up and i look around and it's just a shitty house and i don't even have the  whole house and i'm like and then i started thinking because it was in northport and i'm just  kind of like oh this must just be a summer home like i'll be summering in northport summering 
[01:44:00]  you know people go to northport just to chill out yeah yeah it was an old house a lot of rusted  shit in the yard and the backyard yeah yeah i was just like oh man i thought i'm dealing with a  horrible landlord he's got his own radio show he's got to be wealthy what'd you guys do in the house  together that day yeah that's actually watched uh the crow did we really yeah it was the crow  there's something something so creepy about you guys in the house watching the crow that's so 
[01:44:30]  random little did we know the future would be this yeah and it was i remember though because it  was like there was no lights on either it was really dark you're off the air at midnight  going for two in the morning fucking brewing in the house like like in that little living room  area i didn't have money to pay the electric bill it's so funny you guys watching the crow  two in the morning together and yeah yeah like i have plans to conquer new york talking about  what's gonna happen yes but it continued in boston and we were kicking ass together now and we 
[01:45:00]  weren't making any money no we finally made money when we came back to new york i realized very quickly  that that was a fallacy that if you're on the radio you're wealthy we were huge in boston and we  were still struggling yeah more or less yeah i hope he was living with my mother-in-law yeah i lived with her  for six months going fuck that's six months of rent i don't have to deal with right right you can get  savings or something yes we moved in we all were living there me my wife at the time and uh opie and  the mother-in-law living in the in her little fucking townhouse and uh but but my wife and her 
[01:45:30]  mother got along so poorly that it was like day one she's like i'm getting the fuck out of here i gotta  get away from this bitch and i go to ann i'm like oh you guys are leaving but this is great i like  she cooks dinner she actually did my laundry i think she made the bed every day when i went to  do the radio show with ann i'm like my chick at the time didn't want to move to boston so i'm like  what the fuck i'll just stay where i am that's what i was thinking at the time too it was kind of  like oh i could fucking you know save up some money 
[01:46:00]  i don't know how we got into this i don't know this is depressing all the millennials out there  yeah can we get off on a different subject right now because uh i'm living with my parents i have  a lot of grief god sakes yes oh the biscobo saga i'm sorry i'm looking at the i don't even know if  you need the visual on that one i think you could just pop that we play a little like driving around  yeah i lived at home until i was 30 and you know how i remember i met a girl in vegas 
[01:46:30]  when i was opening for dice at the fucking venetian and she thought i was fucking hot  shit and i was joking with her i was being sarcastic i'm like yeah i got a jag and a  band and she's like really oh my god she believed it and then she fucking i i she i flew her to uh  to jersey where i live with florentine oh no and i'll never forget when she saw what a fucking  hunk of garbage my apartment was because i had the roof leaking remember she's like do you have any  any vodka and i gave her fucking vodka and i just taught her chess in my living room it was fucking  that was your whole that was my time was wow i feel so bad about that black mold on the walls we 
[01:47:00]  did a cribs with jim norton we actually went through his place i was 33 it was unbelievable  how much mold he had in that joint it was terrible i love how she immediately goes do you have any  vodka like can i just numb this yeah that's what it was that's what it was like i'm about to get  surgery in the old west just give me some bourbon let's get this over with where's the bends  you gotta tell them real fast before we move on out of the shit you would bring girls back to your  parents house i was in my late twenties yeah i'd get blown and the fuck i remember me and my 
[01:47:30]  friend larry got a fucking pregnant prostitute in my fucking grandmother's uh where she she's dead  but in her basement and this girl spiked up a crack pipe she spiked up a fucking crack i'll never  forget that in grandma's house yeah i mean by one of my parents house in your parents house jim  you casually rushed by about eight things just to get to the point of your story i got to pose  pregnant prostitute my grandma she's dead anyway wait a minute we're getting we're just rushing by  all that yeah yeah what are where are we heading like what's what's the kicker of this of all that 
[01:48:00]  yeah i don't worry about it's just the illusion of wealth people have they think that you're doing  better in show business they have no idea yeah that is so this i lived in this house just show them the  photo being pulled apart i lived in this house until i was i was doing comedy for 13 years 10  years to 13 years is when i lived here just just the photo don't even show them the house it's too  long but they're just showing there's all the mold on the ceiling this is online yeah yeah oh behind  that pic picture that is disgusting this looks that you look at the mold is leaking watch when they 
[01:48:30]  lift that picture up this is so yeah they were hiding the mold with that picture obviously no i don't  want to yes yeah this is where i live there there's mold here we go okay they are lifting a picture  of oh god yep oh no that's like amityville horror shit that's it isn't that isn't oh and and it's  under a course a nice framed chagall yes yeah that's my framed chagall isn't that like the in the 
[01:49:00]  isn't that that weird brain-eating mold yeah that's not good you have to flee the house that's the black  yeah yeah yeah i think so this doesn't seem that long ago well it's got to be 13 years ago right  uh what are we in 2013 yeah it's 13 years ago yeah i'd i'd been at it probably almost nearly 20  years before i could afford a house there's just yeah there's not that much people people see you  because you have so much exposure people don't realize that fame and fortune are usually completely 
[01:49:30]  opposite yeah you know you can be very famous and have zero fortune yeah yeah it really is a  fucking long process to make any kind of fucking real money man people are so disappointed when  they realize oh man yeah broke if you're if you're on tv you have a shitload of money that's the  the illusion and then when you start making money one of the first things you have to do is start  paying off all the debt you accrue to even get like i had to i had so much debt that there was  nothing i could do about it like i have to keep living in this debt because this is the life i'm 
[01:50:00]  living and then i was thank god i was able to finally pay it off exactly yes that happened to  me too with credit cards and shit i was like i just i i just resigned to the fact that i am going to be  paying the minimum balance yeah for the rest of my life oh yeah how many times i i remember one time  oh god okay i was in san risco my phone got cut off because i hadn't paid the bill so i got to walk down  i was rolling nickels in quarters i had a huge bucket of change and i sat there for a few hours  and rolled enough to literally i had like two hundred dollars and right i had them in a big 
[01:50:30]  bag a trash bag and i walked down to the uh the office the the phone company office where you  literally can pay it in person and get it turned on right there yeah so i'm lugging this trash back  down clement street so i can go pay my bill and there's this kid a i was like 20 at the time he was  like 17 a able-bodied totally healthy young kid uh begging on clement street just like yeah you 
[01:51:00]  need change like just again this is like early 90s and i was like i am really sorry i don't have any  money and i actually stopped there's no reason to talk to this this right i'm like i gotta go pay  this phone i have just enough to pay it i gotta get my phone turned back on and i because i'm trying  to be a member of society you able-bodied young man so then i go to the office i pay it but i was  like i had like 87 cents left like oh i actually had more than i thought i was so happy that when  i was going back i passed him and went hey man look i got i got some change and i gave him my change 
[01:51:30]  i was in such a good mood oh man and then he stopped and he went you said you were broke you  fucking asshole oh jesus holy shit so okay that's yeah got it yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't realize  people can rip you off on credit cards too that's a problem when like you get into credit card debt  i was like i had three thousand dollars on each one and then all of a sudden i had like a ten  thousand dollar hit well i used to go to these prostitutes and pay with a credit card i really  would it would never occur to me that they would rip you off oh really the prostitutes wouldn't rip you 
[01:52:00]  off yeah so i had fucking i think i had to call and fucking get ten thousand dollars with the  fucking bullshit charges taken on my credit cards well that's weird because you haven't seen the uh  the jim memorial uh jim uh norton memorial thank you from all the prostitutes for all the rice  cookers and uh you know laundry machines you bought them there's a whole oh that joke went  fucking oh my god could not have been sweatier or clankier jim did you see the one time 
[01:52:30]  oh fuck like here i literally limped my way towards a non-punny right i threw out a dumb story that  there really wasn't nowhere to go with where do you i gave you the beginning middle and end there's  nowhere to go with it why that's an amazing story without the details i didn't even mention  they were trannies i mean believe me thank god i didn't throw that in but jim's face was literally  he was it was i was like again i was like a special kid let's let him tell his story and then  when you oh god jimmy what when when a pregnant hooker shows up are you are you pissed she didn't show 
[01:53:00]  like we picked her up oh how pregnant eight and a half months nine months oh my god yeah no  bullshit no no and you had no problems walking no problem with it i don't remember why we did that  i remember she blew both of us she blew me and larry and then she sparked up a crack pipe right by my  grandmother's old bookcase and she had a copy of johnny we hardly knew ye in the bookcase about jfk  maybe they were just jimmy and his friend reading the good earth they're like oh that 
[01:53:30]  seems to get birthed in the rice field let's just try to recreate that was there any guilt  yeah a little bit yeah no it was the drugs i felt bad about like ah man it's a secure smoke  coke when it's being cooked it's a fucking no it's a very distinct odor where my parents would  fucking smell it oh man were they upstairs at the time yeah you bring a fucking pregnant hooker  into the downstairs part of the house when your parents i remember being nervous like  just having a girl over on the couch doing normal fucking shit you know making out and 
[01:54:00]  dry humping you were worried they were going to come check it out right what was that is that  not a pregnant hooker smoking crack next to johnny we hardly knew ye  i can't wait till jim gets his louis style show and his pitching stories  yeah well so in this episode this is a pregnant i'll like take three months oh no nine she's got  nine like right should we smoke and crack trust me jim already has that show written and yeah  trying to get rid of it can we get the clearance to use the book johnny we hardly do i need that in 
[01:54:30]  the shot i need that to frame the left side of her face yeah because she's doing it  the camera has to pay into that before commercial  so pat what are you promoting we didn't have any mention patents promoting right yeah whatever  happened to moby dick is that a book you've written yeah honestly no oh i'm uh uh there's two things  i'm doing i the next tuesday is the season two premiere of the heart she holler uh which is a 
[01:55:00]  adult swim show that the guys they do wonder shows i don't know if you watch wonder shows and  it's wonder shows and is amazing it's this it's like a it's like if if sesame street were on bath salts and  they go and just drive people in new york insane and and do they have these things like uh kids on  the street kids on the beat beat kids beat kids and it's like kids doing the news so there's a kid  they address a kid as hitler and then he's talking to like what's wrong with what do you think is wrong 
[01:55:30]  with the youth of today like these old people like why are you like they're so upset and then they also  send this kid to the racetrack to talk to just these old people to racetrack this one  little kid's like i can do an impression of you and this sweet old man's really yeah gamble gamble  gamble die so um so those guys did this show called the heart she holler which is like  think of the think of the most annoying brooklyn hipster and what they think the south is 
[01:56:00]  they think a red state is and then give that person bath salts and that's what the show is it's  this this insane inbred and we did six episodes two years ago and adult swim like it so much they  went why don't you do 14 more we're going to run them every single night of the month like a soap  opera oh it's just weird they're each like 11 minutes long and it's the most nice they do short  shows on adults they do very short yeah it has that nice like cool if it's only 11 minutes just do  11 minutes make it great yeah and and it is the most disgusting i've ever done on camera oh wow 
[01:56:30]  weirdest should i've ever done if you want to watch like people crawling into women's vaginas and and a  woman there's a scene they showed last night they did a thing at the nighthawk in brooklyn where a  where a guy oh god this is so gross um i'll base i'll just put it this way he she a woman does him from  behind because something is sticking out of his rear that she is riding but and i'll just leave it at 
[01:57:00]  that it's horrifying i i would gather she's sharing a dildo with his asshole uh you know what see that  would be nice no it's something oh nice a very solid log there thank you wow i didn't want to be the  one to say it so but it's brilliant it is a it's a brilliant show and then the uh and then now that  i've said all that next saturday the 21st in la i'm doing uh the the los angeles public library is 
[01:57:30]  doing this celebration of moby dick wow look at that three readings i'm just going to go to three  different libraries and read sections from moby dick which um they've sent me these sections i mean  i've never read all of moby dick i'm gonna i'll admit it oh sorry um that is a seriously  fucked up book yeah some of the stuff that goes on in that book it's just pages and pages of just  psychosis that so i'm going to be reading some of the the weirdest parts because you're going to put 
[01:58:00]  on a dramatic reading voice i think i'm going to put on i'm going to try to and then i'm going to get  confused and angry because these passages are really really weird i didn't know that herman melville was so  twisted yeah twist like a damaged guy yeah how long is his passage each and like a page and a half  like really quick and then i'll talk to the audience about like what the hell just happened  like and there'll be people there that you know there's there's already people like because i was  announcing it on twitter and then they're like hey make sure to read this passage because and like 
[01:58:30]  i've been looking some of them up and they're they're really hard it's a lot of twisted  shit in there like his fucking captain and the cabin boy and shit well there's a lot of like  there's all this there's all these references or at least they allude to the idea that  he's gone he hates this whale so much that he's gone to all these islands of different savages  and he's storing these like zoroastrians and these crazy religious fanatics but he keeps them stored  like under the decks and they just sit there smoking weed all day and going crazy and the minute 
[01:59:00]  the whale services he's going to like let these maniacs loose to go kill this thing so on the on  the deck of the ship is quee quag and all these guys but then underneath of it it's like the  gathering of the juggalos and he's just giving them all pcp throw them out like a cluster bomb  exactly it's amazing yeah i had no idea i've never read the book no i don't know nothing i might have  to read that one that's cool i just hear the name and giggle yeah can't help it well 
[01:59:30]  also what i didn't know about the book was hermit melville was this hugely successful like  killer diller author of money fame and then he spent all these years writing his great american  and it ruined him and he died penniless and kind of really yeah this thing just ate him alive and  he wouldn't and they put it out everyone hated it like all their views like this is the worst  most unreadable piece of shit this guy flushed his career down the toilet when did it become a classic 
[02:00:00]  uh i think like 50 years after he was dead wow yeah it was really weird it just kind of he just  kind of blew it so damn yeah yeah it was just it was a guy like imagine uh like imagine think of  like bruce springsteen and then all of a sudden for the like he stops doing music for 10 years and then  comes out with this weird atonal like he's just banging on like a weird like a dixie cup with  with a mummified penis yeah for four hours and everyone's like that's it it's all i'm doing from 
[02:00:30]  now on they're like god he's gone and then he just ends up like dying in a men's hotel somewhere but  then 50 years later people dig that this is the greatest album ever do you know the history of  how it turned it around and how it became that i don't know i still got to read that part because  it's an amazing it is a fascinating story about a guy burning his life right around and then that  becomes a thing he's and then his big bestseller books no one gives a shit about yeah they were  bestsellers during his lifetime no one reads when when did he what was his uh life and death years 
[02:01:00]  roughly uh i see i don't know did he die in the 1900s or the eight i think he died in the late 1800s  but don't quote me yeah there you go get on wikipedia i'm gonna have to do that yeah he's also  his other big one of his big bestsellers was called umo o-o-m-o and if you do crossword puzzles  you see that a lot yeah it says melville novel oh this person needs vowels in his puzzles so here comes  umo get no umo because that's gonna be the one in there well you got uh 1819 to 1891 i didn't live 
[02:01:30]  the fuck in was he 73 almost made it 72 years old right lived a long life died miserable you doing  animation still yeah i do well you know now i i i because my daughter is four and we watch all these  animated shows and then sometimes i'll tweet about them like is it like um i i can't get the  the doc mcstuffins uh tune out of my head of course and then they'll call me and go hey you  want to do a voice like it all my all of your favorite like 90s musicians are all doing kid

[02:03:30]  one i can't stand out of all the kids programs yeah and she loves cutting that little theme that weird  i'm caillou i've heard that yeah do you do animation voices jim because you have an amazing  voice for animation you should be doing voiceovers thank you i wish there was somebody else in my  career that felt that way a person of power or influence that was managing me when you were when  you guys were playing the the early uh early jim norton uh oh yeah yeah thing with that voice it 
[02:04:00]  sounded like you were doing a voice yeah how we doing i should have had my throat cut ah yeah that's  back at that was that was that here and we did that at any w it was just played over uh best of  yeah yeah just played last week amazing yeah who came in patrice boss yeah they were all it was  it was like they brought in the magnificent seven of ball busters and then found the most embarrassing  like it was the perfect storm of ball busting that's exactly we've done a few of those over the years 
[02:04:30]  they're very uncomfortable yeah we've played some of our old radio shows from the beginning and you  don't get jimmy's will stand up four words before somebody just jumps yeah whoa what yeah it's so  horrible it's humiliating yeah it is mine mine was terrible ah yeah people oh like me like me like me  like me what were you they weren't what were you dressed like how were you dressed what were you  wearing um it should have been a fucking suit with my hands over my chest i was wearing

[02:05:30]  it's all this nonsense you buy into that thank god some of us get out of and well how much nonsense  remember when you would buy into the idea that if you fuck up at this club or anger this club in your  mind it's a network right they all talk to each other and you'll be banned from all right like like  suddenly you have a cabaret card it's 1961 and you'll be banned and then you realize later oh  they were it would have actually helped my career if certain club owners had hated me immediately  because it would have the word would have gotten out that oh this guy's actually good if this 
[02:06:00]  asshole yeah he hates him or yeah yeah there's no loyalty you could burn down the cleveland improv  and then still hire you in baltimore yeah they don't give a shit they really don't so yeah there  was always that oh frustrating how do you know like when you're starting out like that what to  even wear like like oh i'm wearing these purple things like was it a was it calculated did you go  into that closet and be like tonight i'm on stage let me get that or did you just throw on club owner  gave me them they said mark veto who runs club casbah and uh wallet well would gave me a couple of baggy 
[02:06:30]  pants i just thought they were kind of cool and i would tuck my shirt in here's the one i wore during  the my fight with you rock  shorts exactly i would always try to like uh wear the i would always try to dress like in the subtle  comedian uniform yeah so it's like um maybe like the the the suit jacket but then the jeans and then  the bright sneakers like come on you don't know what's gonna come out of this guy he's dressed for fun 
[02:07:00]  and and then and then the the t-shirt under the suit jacket with a weird ironic logo on it you know  look it's the mr bubble look i'm nuts you we don't know what i'm gonna do i mean if i'm willing to put  this on what's gonna happen oh jesus is so pathetic so needy there's nothing that's what that's what's  hard about watching you when you're yourself and young it's not that you're not funny it's that you're  needy you're so needy it was both yeah i was not funny and i was needy that's that when we were 
[02:07:30]  going through old radio stuff i was i was so happy to be there months out of doing construction  so i was just so happy but you get a pass i'm like oh my god i'm so everything was so like oh yeah  over the top fun i was just so eager to like anything i'd throw in an imitation dude i must perform  because the attic was waiting for you yes that attic was so you kind of have a pass oh you came out 
[02:08:00]  of this kid this kid this kid he came out of nowhere though but it is you know i started okay and  that's where he's going i started this shit when i was 18. he can't he's in his 30s comes out of  nowhere and boom oh you know what his advantage was and yours too is because you started young and you  started from with the past you had you had this cliff of darkness behind you of there's nothing  to fall back on like so you've got to work twice it makes you work twice as hard when you have got 
[02:08:30]  nothing yeah yeah nothing like i had when i started doing stand-up i kind of blew everything else  right and i realized i can't work in every office i got i worked in either people hated me or i hated it  and i had a terrible attitude because somebody's like i have a clip to my back yeah if i fall back  i will fall off the planet it's gone gone so you're one of those people that well they fell through the  cracks of society i literally that's where i would have ended up i would have yeah yeah all those guys  almost made it oh yeah yeah because that's the other side of this those guys that almost made it but 
[02:09:00]  had the cliff at their back and they fucking fell uh how many how many whatever reason geniuses do we  know truly visionary guys that just never they're just gone or they're still around but what do you do  they made bad decisions a lot of them or they a lot of people wanted to just work the big road  headliners of like 1992 i started 1990 and a lot of those guys began in the 80s and they they  headlined before they were ready because the 80s had a fucking million clubs so everyone got the 
[02:09:30]  headline oh yeah and then they got bottleneck squeezed out in the fucking early 90s and they  couldn't find work and like those guys that would work in like 92 93 they're gone now yeah because  the rule a lot of those rooms aren't around so also they got used to a certain lifestyle yeah of  i make this much money i do this and the people that survived when the boom stopped and there were  people that did make it but those are the ones who are like i got to get some other shitty job and  keep doing stand-up until it comes around again yeah yeah they do that but you're right there 
[02:10:00]  were some people that are like um you know i used to headline at uh yeah you used to headline in a  club chain that does not exist it doesn't even exist anymore and no one cares yeah yeah and there  were also those guys that well you know they wrote their 45 minutes and then they just i'm so i'm done  writing yep exactly 45 that's my life yeah absolutely comic i don't understand those guys why would  i go on stage for no money you see some of those guys come through you know once a year and you go see  and you're like that what are you doing the same thing same exact thing isn't it fun i thought it  was fun writing jokes that was the whole point of doing this you get to you have to do the same 
[02:10:30]  shit over and over again new stuff yeah those guys if i'm merciless with those guys they're  fucking lazy yeah think you're fucking lazy yeah write a joke or try a joke they were the same  fucking yeah dog shit inflection for 10 years oh fuck you fuck you i i on hbo uh i think it's hbo classic  comedy whatever the fuck it is uh they they play a lot of the old specials from the 80s and and  stuff and you see these guys you're like oh yeah that guy and he had like a little a little fame 
[02:11:00]  back then and you realize you never saw this guy after like the boom of uh stand-up comedy just  they're gone are they i was gonna ask are they still doing comedy but in some weird fucking even  knows places or disappear something disappear man a lot of them a lot of the guys that i started with  in dc uh these headliners ended up on uh morning radio doing am oh really not like not like satellite  stuff i mean like am local and angry conservative you know like there's a guy i remember a guy that i 
[02:11:30]  used to work with and we weren't really friends work with him and he was going off about well you know  i used to be a comedian and black people in clubs let me tell you something because i've actually  experienced it i'm like with the kramer it was well but it was like i see what you're saying but you're  basing for you're basing a political philosophy on three bad nights that you had at garvin's  which by the way were bad nights like that was his argument with the call yeah oh god you ever do 
[02:12:00]  garvin no but i remember the name from dc garvin's was their their big claim to fame they're gone  is that they uh uh they had dave chappelle starting out he uh got his start there and they treated him  like such absolute dog shit yeah that he left for new york and then i remember a club another club not  garvin's but one a lot like garvin's dave chappelle was getting ready for his first hour the killing  him softly and he called his managers called the club and said dave would like to do the weekend you 
[02:12:30]  can have him for eight hundred dollars for the whole week and he just wants to do sets you know this  is the last minute you just all you got to do is give me eight hundred bucks so you know this is  dave chappelle you know right he probably just wanted some money it was already dave chappelle  to pay for exactly right and they and they wouldn't pay him they wouldn't do it and then i  heard the two managers talking and one of them was like  fucking kid used to emcee here for 25 bucks a set five years ago and suddenly got to give him  eight hundred dollars like well because he's not the kid you like in their mind you're just frozen 
[02:13:00]  there and yeah yeah you're still the same how great is it they're gone how great oh they're all  the whole thing just collapsed that's great yeah yeah it is nice when you get a club from a a scumbag  club a club owner running it and then it just goes belly up the good yeah fuck yeah uh it's the it's  just and i've been with bands too when we used to play and uh you know at the end of the night you go to  get paid and there's always a problem you know well you know we have the door count and it was this it's 
[02:13:30]  like we had our own guy with that you know i gotta go with my guy and you're like you just you're  really gonna screw me on 25 people you prick like like you do realize this can't sustain like  your club is just gonna collapse right right right there's no way if you keep pissing the talent on  no one will talking everyone over right yeah yeah and they all try to they all try to 
[02:14:00]  fuck you for eight seats or ten seats or no we're doing a golden ticket thing you know but you  aren't supposed to because we have a contracted ticket price they all try to get an extra few  dollars see that's what again if they were trying to fuck me over for 20 grand i would at least right  right i'm dealing with a super villain but when you're when you're dealing with someone and you're  like you're i just talked to you for 20 minutes because you were trying to get like 48 out of me  that's what that's what drives me crazy yeah yeah just yeah that much and it's weird when you have 
[02:14:30]  these these like old clubs that like for years you worked in and then you realize that it's 2013  and you're going back to the comedy cabaret at poco's restaurant in doylestown oh jimmy tickets  are on sale now i'm working on my new hour so i'm just going to just to work i'm gonna have like  maybe some paper with me and just work on that's cool yeah no i when i was doing this i just taped  my new special uh in july and i did the same thing i there was a um i did a every thursday night i did

[02:38:30]  wife were supposed to meet us in the hot tub and just he came out oh that's doug henning came out  doug henning gets in with my wife and i and i saw her look she gave me that look like what's going  on and she went i'm very uncomfortable with you rubbing my leg jim likes his legs rubbed and went  don't you know what he's talking about so he started the guy was rubbing her legs yeah and then he  started massaging my legs in the hot tub he didn't take that as a hint to get the 
[02:39:00]  fuck out no dude that's how stupid i am i can easily be raped one day i know i can i almost was  without even knowing you don't want to make a scene yes just because i don't want to that's so  stupid so you're allowing doug henning to rub your legs so doug henning brings me up to his bedroom  the next day he talks me into this and i go all right d i'll go first did he hold your hand as you 
[02:39:30]  walked up to his bedroom i go in there and it's next to his bed the massage table's next to his  bed and he goes i had my underwear he goes you know normally people take the clothes off so i take  the clothes off and i'm just laying there there's no sheet over me oh my god naked raw meat and he  starts getting a little a little too a little too much in between the legs yeah yeah hitting the 
[02:40:00]  balls with the finger yeah holy and then when the massage jim yeah when i had to turn over oh no  i was like i called it quits oh now you drew the line yeah i'm like yeah i'm not comfortable with  this side and then went downstairs like you're not gonna like to and then we left and we went and  we stayed in a park until nighttime we sat there we parked next to a creek until nighttime we came  back in the house slept and the next day we checked out but i clearly could have been why didn't you 
[02:40:30]  check out that day and just go to a hotel we were stuck i didn't know where we were in the middle of  nowhere we were in like montana the grand tetons we're at we're in the middle of nowhere it was  horrible that guy was so close to it to to getting in my bone hole yeah yeah that's a lot of action  what a trooper you are though after a little asshole tickling you still turned over for a minute  if you would have just like perched your ass up a little bit we would have had a situation he'd 
[02:41:00]  have slid a digit in there yeah he definitely was suspect i just didn't know you think jeez wow  colombo what's your job you think then you're rubbing your legs in a hot tub naked naked  that was the weird part she called him out though good for her it's a great story yes good for her  and i didn't you're weird like you do i punch him out is he really just trying to sell the massage is  he trying to get a menage a twilight like what's going on like i would have thought you'd have said 
[02:41:30]  something like two what are you doing man i should have i should have yeah yeah because that isn't  even like i think in combative it's kind of like what are you doing i might you know and that's that's  probably where where marijuana can hurt you everything's cool right that's all cool right  this guy's just doing his own thing right right yeah who am i to right judge and  that would make sense that makes sense we're not if i had if i had a drink it too he would have been 
[02:42:00]  missing teeth he would have been missing teeth hey faggot  what's your problem dog faggot hey you want to see a magic trick  hey your teeth are about to disappear  hey here's my weenie you want to play hide the baloney huh you want a massage guess what 
[02:42:30]  let's watch your eyes pop open while i bung you from the old doug how's that how's that for a magic trip  it's an illusion it's an illusion that i'm bunging you from behind doug  we forgot for a moment that brewer uses smoked pot and it makes complete sense now yes yeah now it  makes sense yes yeah where you're just like yeah i was totally into the one hitter so yeah yeah he's  cool man she's feeling my wife up you know these are my hang-ups out here in montana these are my 
[02:43:00]  hang-ups i i don't need to put them on him he's the cool guy he's the guy that's got it together  i'm fucked up he obviously knows what's going on here there's no reason for rage against doug  oh that punch him in the face right i should have when did you realize that you checked in and when  did you get the first creepy vibe from right off the bat right right off wow yeah huh i didn't like him 
[02:43:30]  from the beginning yeah what did you do that made you not like him this is fiber he you know what  it's about looking like doug henning right off the bat looking like doug henning and and they were  really they were a little too uh hippie slash earthy for me oh he had a girl he did have a girl but  even she was a little suspect a lot of granola before granola was in uh-huh all right and so it's  like um you know once when people shake your hand that you do the limp thing that really bothers me 
[02:44:00]  yeah it really like dude shake my hand you think he would have popped your cock in his mouth though  i think i i think i would have had such i think he would have let me dirty his hair  yeah he would have eaten your ass on that table oh god jesus dude yeah oh that's oh man  god only knows what shenanigans happens in that house oh yeah he said shenanigans this morning 
[02:44:30]  i almost pulled over i started laughing so hard oh and he gets the right combination of people in  there dude you're the first one to say no we probably couldn't believe you're right  oh you're right you're the first one that actually went for the naked massage yeah yeah  that didn't end up with it he let it go come in his mouth he let it go oh that guy was counting  his chickens that that day oh god i got a naked massage get fucking i'm dumb i'm in jerking off  while he massage you like you'd probably feel like if you look back he's just rubbing you with one hand  he's probably plumping his dick up with the other putting that chlorinated smelling lotion on your back 
[02:45:00]  yeah rub it in deep it's a deep tissue massage  i bet he's supposed to the table to get his rod against your knuckles because my hot stone  first i dip it in the hot lava and then i rub it on your back yeah you like that massage  he definitely has a history that's great yeah you don't need any sheets  did you guys talk about it afterwards oh god no no no there was no more oh me and d yeah yeah

[02:48:00]  just always kind of like lurking like a lawn jockey you'll walk into the lobby and there's greg  charles yeah someone's here drinking something yeah drinking some are you kidding right what a  creep have you done the gig before or no never i've never been in the building carolines so i'm  excited to do it you've never done carolines i never have yeah wow i don't know why you know  there's some places you just don't do it and then you do them yeah this is your first new york trip or  no no um wait where are you from originally i grew up in boston but i did i went to nyu uh but i've 
[02:48:30]  lived in l.a for the last 12 years oh shit okay what'd you major in uh musical theater can you sing  oh yeah yeah i don't know but uh yeah no i really did and i know people hear that now and they're  like for real and i just did that's what i studied except my senior year i started going to see comedy  and i was like i don't want to do musical theater anymore but then i started to get jobs in musical  theater uh but then i was in a big car accident and when i got out of that i was like i'm just gonna  do comedy really how bad was the car accident real bad uh i drove into a building i drove into the 
[02:49:00]  department of water and power in l.a uh very fast probably a stout building yeah that sounds like  you know it's not like the uh little pigs uh it wasn't like a pop-up concert it was an actual  stone built mortar and yeah so i drove into it and uh why i was drunk i don't remember doing it i was in  a blackout and uh that i got sober right after that i had been trying to quit drinking for years and  then i did that and i was like i'm gonna get over and then after i got out of jail and hospital and 
[02:49:30]  wheelchair i was like i'm gonna do wait chill wheelchair then i decided injuries uh i broke  both my arms pretty badly and my legs they weren't broken but they were in like uh these leg things  i couldn't bend my knees because they had they did um surgery on them as well and so i yeah it was a  mess i was in jail in a wheelchair covered in blood my my penis and testicles would expose themselves  periodically in jail when i slid out of my wheelchair boy um and yeah but then once i got better i said 
[02:50:00]  oh wow i'm alive because it was sort of a surprise then i decided to start doing stand-up how long  were you in jail for not long at all not even 24 hours because they were like but i then i had a  court date and the judge said do you how was jail do you like it and i said i didn't care for it he  said because you have to go back or you can go to a halfway house and all that stuff and i said i'll do  that so for four and a half months that's where i lived uh per the state of california's orders and  it was great i actually enjoyed it a lot how long ago is this now 11 years ago oh wow yeah so it's 
[02:50:30]  a ways back did you have fun at least the night you were i did you totally did as long as you got  that too i remember the night too i remember there was a girl named juna at this party that's a fun name  and and and i was like i like you and uh then she was like well just go stand in that corner and i  look okay and i remember i had a big glide like a solo cup like having a keg party and we drank all  the beer then i like drank all the wine and then i took a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of vodka and 
[02:51:00]  i just poured it up to the top which if you don't drink i'll just tell you that's not actually a drink  that's not a cocktail and i drank that all the way down and then i remember halfway through my second  one my brain just turned off yeah but my body didn't my body was like no we should still party  and uh that's bad anyway that was all a long time ago and i'm glad that happened because it led to  me being here with you guys today we're just getting to know you i i black guys are amazing  one other question they ever tell you how fast they think you were going when you hit the building 
[02:51:30]  um you know i have a pretty detailed police report that i'll pull out whenever i like move or  whatever and i'll find it uh i don't think i was going ridiculously fast honestly i but you know  what i do know i took out um three parking meters and two trees on the way into the building so it  had to be so i was it wasn't like first year 30 000 pounds of bananas by harry chapin you hear  that song when he describes the wreck yeah wow it's a great blackout story man people wake up they have 
[02:52:00]  no idea what the fuck happened to the worst just the worst and you always arms and you always knew you  want to do stand-up yeah well i didn't i mean i always loved comedy as a kid and we listened to  cosby albums on road trips with my family and stuff but it was my senior year in college when i started  to attend comedy and be around comedians and feel them and smell them and feel the contours of their  body uh then i knew that that i was like i gotta do this this is it this is because acting is fine but  you're saying things that other people wrote and then once you produce laughter out of other people's 
[02:52:30]  bodies with things that you thought up that's it forever i mean that's yeah until you die whether  it's next week or in you know 100 years right so musical theater like yeah you uh you know like  nathan i was just thinking today like nathan lane it's really hard to make a living it seems or be a  star purely from doing that oh god yeah he's one of the only guys that seems to be like a national  name who just makes his life i can ferris bueller's doing a pretty good job too yeah yeah yeah he's just  out there yeah he's just out there doing a lot of uh song and dance yes song and dance yeah yeah 
[02:53:00]  but he was a movie star first though like i i mean didn't as a kid yeah yeah we knew him already from  glory and yeah yeah incredible it's funny you know on the plane here yesterday i watched hugh jackman was  on inside the studio and it was like 50 i was like shut your fucking mouth like the most annoying like if  if you can imagine like a if you can imagine like a 17 year old girl being like i'm nuts about  musicals like that he was 50 that but then 50 like so inspiring that i was like almost crying on the 
[02:53:30]  plane like every other thing he'd say i'd be like you just fucking should get hit by a car and then  the other time i'd be like i love you hugh like it was the weirdest dichotomy i've never felt that way  about a person i i must be love i think i'm in love with hugh jackman he is one of those people too  that's just like two different people i i hadn't known him from anything before you know x-men  wolverine other than a similar lifestyle so you see that and it was like this guy is badass yeah and 
[02:54:00]  then it's like here he is at the tony's yeah yeah and i'm looking going hey who the fuck is that yeah  same guy crazy he's like skinny and and he's hey yeah very questionable on the sexuality portion of  it when i saw that well you know who i think he's just i think he's probably just sexually more  evolved than anybody he's like well i'll get and i'll get good whatever it is probably you know and  i'll do it well so i salute him yes it leads us to the the board game yeah is that what you're 
[02:54:30]  promoting besides the stand-up gig at carolines yeah yeah good for you you know and i know it's insane  but a few months ago a board game company approached me because i read a lot of jokes on twitter and i've  written like 15 000 of them by now and uh you're great on twitter thank you very much it has to be  said publicly thank you yeah but you're one of the good ones man i have a sickness where i need if  i'm not on stage i have to be like like jerking off onto my phone screen trying to make people laugh 
[02:55:00]  and so i um or writing jokes on it and the the board game company broached me and said hey could we  make a game out of your tweets and i was like i've never said yes faster because i love if you think  about like obviously we all love comedy but like if you're like playing game night and stuff like  you can like throw up from laughing if you're playing like with your relative i mean you get  in a fist fight like yeah it's such an awesome experience so the idea that any of my jokes could  be even peripherally involved with like something like that i said i was so excited yeah what is the  can we uh i have not i i briefly took the board out before um but you gotta explain there was a picture 
[02:55:30]  there's a picture of you in your twitter photo yeah an upsetting image green uh yeah actually uh  the fucking awful green bathing suit yeah which highlights uh rob's  but uh you can tell that i'm circumcised which is such a bummer i have two sons and we didn't  circumcise them and i i see their cute little penises when i change your diapers and i envy them  why did i do the same way man yeah my parents cut off half my dick threw in the garbage i want it 
[02:56:00]  back i i'm kind of annoyed that i'm clipped yeah you'd probably be pissed then if you what you  know because the foreskin's always greener probably thinking like you know if you were in circumcised  you'd be like yeah it's supposed to be better as long as you keep it clean and it's supposed to be  better like i hate the fact that the head of my cock is all exposed i'd love to have a nice sheath  covering it really you're not going into battle with it no i know but not usually then we could dock and  everything it's very hard to dock what the reason i asked this and i wanted to wait to you here is 
[02:56:30]  because i took it out uh it's called war of words yep but there's these weird little the thing okay  those are the game pieces oh they are okay and and since we're on uh radio i'll say the game pieces  we've got a van that says ss butt toucher on it we've got a nice wizard hat ham sandwich a cup of  coffee and an alarm clock that says it's 420 with a marijuana leaf and a big red circle with a  slasher now do they consult you on this or did they just yeah those were my choices in fact those 
[02:57:00]  game pieces oh so they said you got you needed a part of it yeah so i was involved like i would do  test plays and stuff i mean all the all the jokes in it are mine but the scaffolding or the skeleton of  it was designed by people who actually know how to make games not by an idiot me um but yeah basically  you just roll a dice and depending on what you roll it decides if you're going to like have to  finish a joke of mine if you're going to have to try to one-up it or tag it or whatever and um 
[02:57:30]  things like that so and there's a subjective element where the people watching can or playing  with you can be like yeah no rick's was better even if it wasn't you can just be like fuck you  so that's what the good stuff so if you're playing with your mom or whatever you know she might  wind up slapping you because you picked your aunt susie instead of her and you got to me that's  the game yeah and then you punch your mom and any game where you're not punching your mom is a shitty  game that's why like have you ever heard of candyland you haven't right it's because you  don't punch your mom when you play that's an old classic yeah anyway shoot some ladders i love 
[02:58:00]  shoots and ladders oh drat shoot some ladders we got this maybe yeah or cheesy who hasn't called  their grandmother a cunt over a game of pork cheese  i wish i could say i hadn't so okay there's three different colors okay so people will land on a joke  and then have to finish it yeah and then the cool part is there's just a fat deck of my cards which  you could even just take into the toilet and read you know three jokes per page and uh or i guess  card a card is like a tiny page that yes it is that's uh wow that's a lot of jokes yeah there's 
[02:58:30]  a lot of jokes in there man fuck a board game that's very bananas somebody sent me on twitter they were  like the only is there somebody was like i've been trying they were like first of all you for making  a board game and i said you're correct and fuck me i should why did i do that and then they said the  only other comedian i could find who did that was rodney dangerfield and so yeah that's uh that'll  work but you're in good company yeah what was this board game was it like i was like i don't get no  respect yeah no i'm sure it's called get no respect yeah oh by milton bradley milton bradley 
[02:59:00]  play the rodney dangerfield game see if you can get respect from your boss  yeah oh there it is is there a commercial for it and of course it's called no respect  it had to be no respect his album it was he had a double album which was very funny it was called  no respect and son of no respect with the two uh records on it it was a masterpiece really hilarious 
[02:59:30]  fucking masterpieces our claim to fame we got rodney uh high wow yeah back at wnew  all right a guy that works here for another radio show stinky would bring our guests into the stairwell  and rodney uh partook that day yes his albums you can just listen to right now in 2013 and he would  just lacerate anything else just so amazing we went and saw him he performed at avery fisher hall  and uh but what did we have in 2001 or something it was around there and uh me and florentine went 
[03:00:00]  just to be in the same room with him like because he was at that point he was like it was hard to  understand because he had been all he smoked a lot of dope he was starting to slow down yeah he was  starting to slow down but fucking just seeing him in that room and watching him like it's rodney i heard  this i heard sure i'm on again yeah i heard a story his uh wife started feeding him the jokes  oh he was your piece through an earpiece and he was still killing it because he he was at a point where he  wasn't remembering his shit anymore so she would read him off stage and he would fucking perform 
[03:00:30]  yeah i heard that too that he would walk in the pool in vegas and just do his act back and forth  in the pool like i guess at that age his mind was just going right right his 80s pot every day he had  a great run my wife and i saw cosby recently live amazing where'd you see him still amazing huh yeah he  was he was uh he's he wasn't like uh like a samurai sword anymore but he's still very very good he did two  hours in those two hours he did six jokes i'm not i'm not joking they were each about 20 minutes in  length and what he does he just tells an amazing ridiculously detail rich story and at the end he 
[03:01:00]  just grabs your neck and fucking snaps it as he ties it all together in a way that nobody before or  since fucking ever did just amazing he made me listen to him uh talk about skiing for 40 minutes  that was one of his bits when i was growing up yeah just about skiing with a million fucking jokes in  yeah just unbelievable great storyteller i saw him with my ex actually in in atlantic city and  we watched him and uh he opened up with this the story he opened with was doing okay you could tell 
[03:01:30]  it was new like this is a comic you he was feeling it out yeah opened with it and then it was it was  going well he was having like a six but then he just went to the next one and started murdering  the and you're like oh he can get a laugh whenever he really wants to like whenever he's not getting  a laugh it's because he's probably experimenting with something but when he wants a laugh and goes  okay it's time now to turn it up it was fucking effortless you know what i was struck by in this  show that we just very recently saw was he wore sweatpants the grossest sandals over socks and like 
[03:02:00]  a graphic t-shirt tucked in and he just goes out and like clips the mic on his shirt and sits down  like your slobbiest grandfather like your grandfather's friend would come over and be like  fuck why is he here and then and then just killed everybody it was amazing that's right he walks  out and just clips on his mic isn't there no intro or something he just walks on stage right out just  walks right out yeah we got to meet him afterwards we got to uh did you talk to him i was fortunate  to be able to do that yeah he fucking receives people i could i met him briefly got a photo with 
[03:02:30]  us so i got him to sign it i didn't think he'd invite he didn't remember me but they brought us back  and he just sat us me and my girlfriend in his dressing room and talked to us for about 20 minutes  and then other people were coming in and you know because i was a comic he's like oh no no no stay  stay stay like he seemed like he wanted somebody else there because he had to talk to these  fucking business people oh yeah but it was weird that's cool he listens like he asks you questions  yeah he asked my wife he knew my wife grew up in north carolina he knew way more about north carolina  than she did he just was it was amazing yeah he cared and listened and it made me realize and you know 
[03:03:00]  what he said to me he goes uh he's like well you know he's like you've got a very beautiful wife here he  goes just make sure you keep her the higher priority over your comedy and then you'll be  better at comedy he's like you have her be priority number one and your kids and then way off in the  distance you can barely see it is your comedy career and uh i was like okay and i sort of laughed  a little bit he goes don't laugh and he was like yeah he made me say it out loud that i would keep my  family above my comedy career and it was kind of like i would have power chills yeah yeah and then 
[03:03:30]  they my now my wife lives with him which yeah that's uh the main i think that's why he's a great  comic because he listens well like yeah he observes everything and that's why he tells the story well  because he is a sponge like he just soaks in information and you have no idea when he's going  to use it he's probably on stage now talking about me no doubt he was a terrible comic  i like uh i like the fact that your game doesn't have uh batteries or a pop-o-matic or anything 
[03:04:00]  that's yeah it is in that sense and uh yeah if you like if you like trivial pursuit you'll notice  the box is kind of the same shape yellow square thing thick square you know it's not your traditional  monopoly long box more cubal uh you know it has started to it's exclusively through amazon right now  and i'm told that what they do is they figure out all their weird algorithms and stuff and then  like a few weeks after it's out which it just came out then they'll start to sell it so you plug it on 
[03:04:30]  twitter and yeah and frankly i hope people buy it but if they don't i still got a game you know what  i mean like i wasn't like oh i hope i make money on a board game i'm not a crazy person i was just like  it's an honor to have it it's so cool people play it and people write me and say that they are playing  it so i'm good great it is pretty cool to have a game you know yeah are you the only one on twitter  that doesn't have haters oh i have so many haters so many visceral i mean hatred that could power a 
[03:05:00]  city yeah amazing now most people and and more than 50 of people are nice kind funny exactly like  they'll i'll do a joke and they'll write something back to me that's like 10 times funnier so i i feel  good about humanity generally because of twitter but still because of the number of followers that i have  the number of people who hate me and want me to die are very high and big and there is a robust  organization yeah yeah the uh boy and they just wait what is the problem they have claw your eyes  out for what is the problem they have with with you why oh last night somebody wrote me uh somebody 
[03:05:30]  wrote me and they said what would you do if you were at a if you were doing an open mic and every comic  before you was a misogynist and i wrote back i was like i would i would get up and i would take a deep  breath from a stage and i would lacerate them in a fun and funny way and uh because that'd be a shitty  boring show you know and then i just talked about how i think like you know i think women are filthy 
[03:06:00]  and dynamic just like men and i think if something isn't funny if it's funny to a group of men and it's  not funny to a group of women it's probably not as funny as it could be it's it's like egalitarian you  want to be like like prior or carlin would be fucking outrageous and women would be like yay  and so i think you know so i wrote that and then people would be like wrote me back and we're like  fucking faggot you know and like i'd be like they've gotta be kidding and then i'd look and they  totally weren't and i'm like like how dare you you know and just ridiculous so but the thing is is you 
[03:06:30]  can find the we live in an amazing world and the internet allows you to connect to all these people  you can focus on the scumbags of which there are myriad or you can focus on the good people i try  to do that more uh because yeah there will always be garbage people but fuck them they can choke to  death i think it's a pretty accurate depiction of society yeah yeah you look at the numbers and  think like yeah i bet there's that many scumbags per good person out there and how many followers 
[03:07:00]  you got now uh like 850 000 heading toward a mill 859 uh you're about to yeah yeah it's a funny  account too it really is rare that i read twitter and laugh out loud but there's been a few things  you've written that i was like fucking like like that i just laughed and you know i don't laugh out  loud in tweets ever well thank you and your avatar is just famous now it's disgusting it's just famous  you can't change that once well that's that damn avatar pops up everywhere well that's the thing 
[03:07:30]  people a lot of guys like will write me and be like hey i want to follow you but i ain't looking  at that fucking picture i'll be like then you'll never follow me i mean the more people hate it the  harder i i affix it to my profile i never understood that too are you fucking like there'd be a funny video  you want to put a link to from youtube or something like that and you know that might be something that  maybe a little uh homoerotic at the beginning of it but but but the payoff is there it's something 
[03:08:00]  and it's like dude i made it through two seconds today you can watch that fucking homo  shit wow are you like i don't have mirrors in my own bathroom i want to see my own penis  it's like you're missing out on something that has nothing to do with you being a faggot don't worry oh  boy don't worry doesn't that seem exhausting it does to live that way yeah yeah i do it with black  people though so yeah well you know we all gotta we all have our crosses to burn to burn yes

[03:09:30]  he was talking about president lincoln in the bible and bowling yeah i used to take him bowling when he was a  boy and i'd clean his fingers with my mouth if they were in the bowling ball  little playmates mistaken pinball for drugs and women who think they're out right jim jeffries is  a good boy he isn't like a banana when you rub it on his cheeks and lips jim jeffries take a seat we're  talking about our president uh buchanan yeah who apparently might have been gay yes yeah i don't know 
[03:10:00]  how we got on this uh oh it goes uh will we ever have a gay president i said yeah there's rumors that  we already had one and his name is james buchanan of course you'll have a guy one eventually eventually  yeah i'm saying you might get in right yeah yeah well i think they a lot yeah you know what yeah it's  funny but i think we'd have a lesbian um president before we have a gay man president an openly gay  yeah yeah yeah flamboyant well buchanan lived with the next vice president and uh who was called nancy 
[03:10:30]  uh the vice president that he lived with the former vice president yeah they lived with yeah the guy  he lived with as he was president was he lived with this guy before he was president uh william rufus  king yeah toss him to the curb before he went to fucking 1600s he's gay he's gay and they called  him nancy not james miss nancy miss nancy oh you mean miss nancy over there right and weren't  there letters that popped up or something achiever letters there was a song found him in the burnt 
[03:11:00]  out cabin two c's with a fucking o and a k and now people trying to back up b-rock there are rumors  that lincoln was gay and then this guy writes uh pull up pierce he looked gay so this is the thing  with lincoln is that that they have like um we we all just fucking wank over daniel day lewis  yeah right yeah like he can't do anything wrong uh-huh but they go that's the best depiction of 
[03:11:30]  lincoln ever mm-hmm who knows that yeah he's doing the depiction of the guy at the fucking  gettysburg museum who does the or the animatronic right right in the hall of presidents or in seven  years ago a machine did it at disney years before daniel day lewis he's doing that right but we don't  know in the same way we don't know what dinosaurs sound like yeah right we just assume because they're  big fucking lizards so they go but we don't know they probably didn't even make a sound they might 
[03:12:00]  sound like sheep oh yeah yeah exactly that might have been that that would look silly and and for  for all intents and purposes lincoln we just think sounds like because he was old looking with a  with a shitty beard yeah yeah and he might have sounded like any dick or anything he had a high  voice right sound like a pofter yeah he figured out his voice was a little higher than we thought so  a lot of people pissed off at eroc we got to go to bonnie in dc really fast bonnie go ahead 
[03:12:30]  hey i just want eroc to defend himself because everybody knows lincoln was gay i just watched a  history channel program reading letters where that he wrote about how he'd always loved this  other dude well they spoke differently in their letters back then right yeah ah my dearest bartholomew  your ass cheeks are lovely this time of year i miss the smell of your taint 
[03:13:00]  balls on a warm summer day anyone who can fuck sally field for that long  where are these letters body where are these letters what letters i'm telling you i watched  a history channel program it wasn't even two weeks ago and they were reading the letters out loud and  they said all right let's find the letters i fear my orgasms have left me a cripple the history channel  has the bible now is history yeah they're letting anything through the history channel they're  fucking like porn dealers and storage wars the history channels really dropped the ball i know right 
[03:13:30]  they used to all be hitler just hitler they ran out of hitler stuff and then they just went ah  hitler yeah let's go for warehouses with stuff and a guy bidding on it i like the old days hitler and  his nazi menace sweeping across europe they show him like tussling the hair of a young german boy  now it's fucking you know how much can we rip you off for a fucking baseball card that's worth  twenty thousand dollars iraq you're gonna defend yourself or what baseball cards old so that's why it's 
[03:14:00]  true history right but the bible the bible thing is i i started watching the bible on the plane coming  over here yeah because i thought comedy purposes sure i want the bible to start with like just just  black and then like oh you want the whole i want a finger it fucking leaps forward to noah's ark  in the first episode i did huh and noah just telling his family about the beginning oh really it's like 
[03:14:30]  noah's sitting on the boat going uh and then he made the animals and then he made some light and here  we are so so there's a lot of hearsay yeah yeah second third party testimony and it gets onto the history  channel and this one begat that one and that one begat that one and begat begat begat they always leave  out those movies because i grew up watching cecil b de mill movies oh yeah ethics but they always  leave out the it's like abraham the guy who went to the top of the mountain and saying god said you 
[03:15:00]  got to kill your son and then god was like kidding you know that one yeah yeah yeah but because you're  going to kill your son you're right by me yeah like oh god cut it out yeah you're killing me why would  you do that i was about to kill him you fucking crazy bastard right but he's like you were gonna  do it weren't you yeah because i really love you i really i really really love you i was gonna kill  my son with no fucking issue yeah and then the next bit of the bible is and then abraham went home and 
[03:15:30]  fucked his sister and that bit's just never depicted in the movies no celebratory of his sister wow where  he went oh fuck my sister it's like i don't have to kill my kid i'm gonna fuck my sister it's a  natural respawn right it's uh yeah anybody would do that wow i never realized that well we got two  things i might have made that up well we got we got two things already we got two things going on  though oh okay everyone wants to talk about lincoln they said he shared a bed with a young boy soldier 
[03:16:00]  for years oh boy toy do you have any info yet sam yeah because erock's not defending himself in 19th  century america people need to understand that men commonly bunked with other men  in the same bed well for example when lawyers and judges traveled the circuit with lincoln  the lawyers often slept two in a bed and eight in a room right don't judge no  william h herndon recall why why wouldn't you just take the floor at that point was it that cold 
[03:16:30]  back please freezing cold and then the rats on the floor you got to sleep with another man you  gotta put your dick in his ass to keep it warm just to just to a fucking forget the fact you're  being eaten by bed bugs exactly you're getting your ass fucked you're going ow ow and you're being  chewed alive they just freed the slaves for the extra space yeah  it wasn't anything they didn't like black people it was just that they were taken up to a space in the  bed but who was the first guy i went all right this is fucked up i'm not sleeping  i don't want to do it anymore his name would have been gary yeah i don't know why what else 
[03:17:00]  sam well a tabulation of historical sources shows lincoln slept in the same bed as at least 11 boys  and men during his youth and adulthood there are no known instances in which lincoln tried to suppress  knowledge or discussion of such arrangements and we vilify michael jackson uh-huh he didn't do  nothing he was just lincoln-esque oh lincoln jesus christ uh like uh lincoln meant joshua fry 
[03:17:30]  speed i don't know if you guys know that yes in 1837 they lived together for four years roomies  during which time they occupied the same bed during the night they were the burton ernie of the civil  war yes i think it's just um four years of sharing a bed with another dude they're roommates yeah sure  in the same bed no lincoln's big feet yeah i'm just fucking getting all tangled with the other  guys he wore a size 17 shoe the other guy would worship his feet oh god because lincoln had a 
[03:18:00]  lincoln had to sleep sideways because he was so fucking tall so that doesn't give a lot of room for  the other dude well i know what you do it convenient you know what you do with your girl you kind of  play footsie under the covers with her and you know maybe you did that with lincoln with lincoln's big hairy  foot yeah you know a big hairy foot thinking playing what's under the stove pipe hat on his  lap yeah is it hard is it soft what is it he would cut the top out of it like you do with a chick with  a popcorn bucket in the movie and his roommate would reach in just tug his cock has ever can i enter your 
[03:18:30]  log cabin yeah give him a fucking extra extra log silly more yeah lincoln's bodyguard and companion  captain david derrickson between september played by sally phil in the movie and april 1863 yeah uh  the two of them would share a bed when lincoln's wife was gone sharing too many beds you know it's  a warmth issue it's very cold yeah yeah i tell you what though i took a friend of mine on the road with 
[03:19:00]  me um for the last few gigs i did and we shared a hotel room if you haven't done it in a while like  with the x with the two beds uh-huh delightful really it's you wake up you know how you wake  up next to a woman and it's that how's the day going uh am i in trouble the first thing you ask  a woman is is how are you is everything okay are we gonna have a good time today is today a good day  or is today shit am i in trouble today have i slept weird have you had a nightmare of me cheating on you 
[03:19:30]  because if you've had a nightmare of me cheating on you then we're having a shitty fucking day she's  going to treat you like you did cheat on her yeah where you wake up next to a friend it's like  we got up last night now it's to get more stories and you have little stories and then you go back  to sleep and then you fart and you giggle at each other it's delightful when you're next to a friend  delightful wow so you you you put your opener in the bed i mean they're the same room i would never 
[03:20:00]  do that i i me was my very best friend was coming out to stay and we shared a room for like five  nights ordinarily i never done it and now i'm thinking of doing it with everyone right because  i had such a good time but he's getting you to smell his dump when you walk in oh it would drive me  fucking well that shit would drive you nuts jimmy oh i would literally if even with my best friend and  the only option was share a room or sleep on the roof in the cold yeah i'd put them on that was the  thing like with baseball players and any sporting players up until about 10 years ago they always 
[03:20:30]  share yeah it was always you always saw oh and he shares a room with they always talk about their  roommate yeah yeah and now they don't do it but it used to be with all sports about 10 years ago  they all share room that's weird huh i'm doing the up fronts for that's right effects we're doing um  is this the bowling thing we're bowling i remember you telling us about bowling a couple yeah we're  coming out i've i've never flown so far to fucking bowl in my life and if anyone from fx is listening  couldn't be happier about it can you ball really no i i can't i'm not i'm not a great bowler i i if if 
[03:21:00]  i play a game i'll get like two strikes you know i'm not embarrassingly bad but i i use an ultra light  ball and and sort of have a weird fred flintstone walk up to the line you know yeah yeah it's it's  it's not like i'm gonna i'm i'm thinking right now when i get there i'm gonna bowl the shit out of this  place everyone's gonna fucking know my name i i i got off at the airport because there's all the the 
[03:21:30]  people i imagine louis will be there and i i think russell russell brand will be there i know  russell but apart from that i was on the fucking plane with the charlie charlie from sons of anarchy  that's who i was sitting next to oh cool and i got off the plane and you've never been less of a  celebrity when all the autograph hunters just fucking zoned in on him and i just walked straight  through oh man the thing was i normally i wouldn't i don't want that attention or anything but the 
[03:22:00]  executives from fx were walking through the airport with us oh no you want them to see you actually see  the pay difference between the two of us like where their money was going yeah like oh the guy  from sons of anarchy yeah he gets to go through he's very british that guy yeah yeah yeah very british  well the thing is you think because he's meant to be a tough guy biker but yeah i always watch that  show like are you tough are you you know what i mean like it always seems like like actors because all 
[03:22:30]  actors are fags right it just seems like actors going yeah yeah don't fuck with me and you know  they're all like fucking snapping their fingers for a fucking latte as soon as the cut  you're tough are you are you have you got to paint it on tattoo you're a big boy now  that's a very good question so the bowling goes down today the bowling goes down today and it's it's 
[03:23:00]  we're meant to we're meant to bowl against um uh the advertising people oh yeah it must be a big  day for them though they're like well they're way more excited than you guys are but imagine the  cat that has to bowl against my team of of dj qualls and dan baccadel like the ugliest people on  television my my show is the ugliest people ever to be fucking put on a screen if my tv show will never 
[03:23:30]  have a calendar right there's never going to be like no in february we've got a picture of rodney  and in his underwear just leisurely walking the beach nice right so so they've got a bowl against  us and you know the disappointment if we get some like mid 40 year old women who are executives who want  to bowl with say the guys from the americans or the fucking charlie from sons of anarchy uh-huh and  they get me and dj qualls who looks like an aids victim right and and dan baccadel it's yeah when 
[03:24:00]  we're going to have the depressed group the the bowling thing australia you didn't have uh american  bowling right you have that no that's the one thing that the whole world agrees on no new england  they'd go with those tiny little fucking soft pins i handle the whole world no even like there's  people in burkas just throwing a ball bowling yeah going ah it's good have you seen candlestick  bowling no but we have it's a nightmare we have my we tried it once up there it's not fun my father 
[03:24:30]  lawn bowls every day lawn bowling what's lawn bowling lawn bowling is not your ball is no no it's a different  thing it's it's it's similar but it's it involves it the ball curves it's on a flat bit of grass yeah and  you roll it and the ball comes and there's a jack and then you've got to get the ball it's the same  as bachi is in the rules as in you have to get it closer but you do it from about i don't know 50 60  meters away and old people just it's something you just start doing when you're old you're like all  right i'm long bowling now yeah you know and my dad just does it just so he doesn't have to see my mom 
[03:25:00]  you know what sucked about candle pin bowling like like you you take the ball and it's got no holes in  the ball you just get a video for jim jeffrey you palm it and no matter how hard you threw it it would  hit the pins go like clink clink it would kind of bounce off like there's nothing better than when  you throw a fucking bowling ball and you get a good fucking and it curves and hooks right in the pocket  and just and it makes a great sound everything goes the candle pin it's just clink clink i tell you 
[03:25:30]  what that bumper bowling though is making kids into tards oh yeah you need gutters come on all right  because my my my fucking yeah my nephew's like what is he he's like he's like 14 yeah i took him  bowling and him and his friends and never been without the bumpers up you don't know what a gutter  ball is i said you gotta put it down man you you look ridiculous it's stupid and then and then the  little his his sister beat him because she had the bumpers up because she's an 11 year old girl like 
[03:26:00]  who gives a let her have the bumpers up yeah she beat him because you know she's playing a sport  that doesn't matter right yeah yeah and then he had a cry oh i was more disappointed because  his sister beat him i was like oh man look at this yeah look see their little little candle  you must have seen this before no i never said listen to the sound like tablets yeah yeah listen  the sound yeah they look like old tylenols i don't know what the strategy is like look at the tiny 
[03:26:30]  ball he's like dennis franz yeah he does kind of look like that that's the ball he's one of those  guys that when you when you meet him and someone goes you know he's 30. he looks 54.  he's from that generation where everyone looked old yeah isn't it almost impossible to get a  strike in candlestick ball i would with that little ball do they do it the u.s here we go  yeah new england oh new england it's all about there's the strike right there but man that has 
[03:27:00]  is there places so stupid or are people just doing it at home it's the new england is all  new england yeah so you go to like actually like there'll be a bowling alley with candle pin bowling  in it lucky strike candle pin bowling lucky they have the regular bowling up there as well but they  certainly have held on to the candlestick too boy if you're not a pro bowler or you don't bowl  very often it's really a hit or miss kind of game isn't it like you could be like hey i bowled 210 
[03:27:30]  that fucking round and then the next round it's like five gutter balls in a row and you'll convince  yourself like i think i got this now this is going to guarantee your alley is going to be perfectly  fucking level that's true all right that'll fuck up these guys i i just i just try to ball it as  straight and down the middle of there's no curve no curving no fucking and you just i can sort of  see one and then sometimes there's one well that one's too straight yeah yeah yeah that one's going  to leave it's going to leave a split yeah that one's too straight yeah you want it just slightly 
[03:28:00]  off right and then if i leave one slightly off if i leave one ball if i leave one pin in the corner  oh that's a nightmare for me that's i could fucking miss it by miles yeah yeah that's luck of the draw  that all i've got is straight down the middle is my whole tactic so if you if you have one in the  corner if you have a seven or a ten pin still standing you have to bowl straight right next  to the gutter exactly and it has to go the whole way without going into the gutter all the way to  the right and do the angle it's not even the walk i i it's not even the ball i've got to stand in the 
[03:28:30]  other person's alley that's what i'm saying yeah and then bowling down i i can't i can't like do that  no angle i can't visualize that if i do it that way right go no fucking chance have you ever been  have you ever been like bowling with a girl and she beats you it's it's demoralizing like i don't  need it i don't need to beat women in sport to feel good about myself right but i do right yeah and  you bowl with a girl it's like all right there yeah i had this one chick from kansas who bowled like a 
[03:29:00]  two hundred and it just was the biggest turnoff i'd ever seen you were done i want a girl that  just fucking just gutter balls it and and just goes oh well whatever i don't want a bowling strikes  i like a girl like you you're right one where where the ball is heading to toward the gutter  she's already turned around and has her drink it back in her hand from the fucking table  so i was shagging a chick in vegas who many years ago ladies and gentlemen here in america shagging 
[03:29:30]  means uh fucking yes having sex i i didn't want to be i know every school  so i i i will i'll tell you the name of the girl was samantha harris she's a she's a redheaded uh

[03:35:30]  have left the room quicker and more disappointed they didn't like you to start with but now they  really fucking yeah hated you i've broken up their day of looking at themselves  they were tanning or something and i interrupted that with my eyes wow that's funny holy  there she is she has a tremendous body she just makes a living out of uh uh bikini competition 
[03:36:00]  it's that whole thing that that manages such dogs when it comes to sex where we're just like  i'll just we'll just pay someone to walk around you know what i mean oh yeah we'll go to it it's  it's like when a woman goes on a bachelorette party and they think they're fucking outrageous for  having a straw with a little on the end of it like look at this this straw has a little on it  we're mental right yes and a man and a man thinks he's outrageous because he 
[03:36:30]  fucked a prostitute yeah which is a completely different image but women are like little bobbly  cocks hanging yeah look at us oh what's still what goes on here stays here ladies come on don't talk  about the fucking springy dick hats we were wearing it's also the menace that's it's so  fucking gross like if it you you'll say to it you'll say to a friend you'll you'll come out of a  lap dance and he'll go how was it you'll go how was it it was awesome she parted her ass cheeks and 
[03:37:00]  shoved it on my face right like that's how good it was right when no woman's ever had a  private dance with a man which like he just pulled these testicles really hard and pulled these  ass apart and shoved his ass over my nose it was one of the best experiences of my life  where men will be like that's you know she shoved her fist in her ass great a woman would be like 
[03:37:30]  he shoved his fist in his arm yeah she'd be horrified she'd fucking feel violent counseling yeah yeah  think of every nasty stripper move when the girl like just gets on the floor yeah and just  she licked my shoe and then just pulled my cock like like if if you just if you if he licked my  shoe and then started fingering me it was so gross right but if you got a hand drop in a strip club 
[03:38:00]  you're like that was a good stripper you start fingering a girl randomly yeah awkward oh very yeah i  would gather it would be extremely awkward uh i remember going to bachelor parties though you  talk about that the bachelorette parties and then they they think it's all just crazy for the girls  to go out and do that i was at a bachelor party once two girls show up and they're on the couch and  they're making out and fingering each other totally naked and they had sex toys like just thrown all  around this place and guys picked up went to the biggest fucking dildo they found that was laying 
[03:38:30]  around there with a little pocket rockets and then there was like something called the anal intruder  and uh they picked that up and just started fucking shoving it into one of the girls just walked over  as they're making out and just shoved it in her well the girl brought that knowing though of course  yeah yeah no there was nary a complaint believe me there there's a there's a comedian from canicle  canada called mike wilmot who's i know mike you're very funny very funny yeah and we're at a  bachelor party and uh he he's you know he wears glasses right and he with everyone's getting 
[03:39:00]  lap dances or whatever and there was one girl walking around stripping and she comes up to mike  and she pulls his glasses off and she puts one handle up her ass and one handle in a cunt  and then she helps it so the glasses start probing out oh shit then she pulls both of them out she licks  the handles and then she puts them crock crookedly back at his face and he goes i'm sure that was very  good but i didn't see a thing yeah but girls are very presumptuous those strippers as to what 
[03:39:30]  they think you're gonna like or what you know because i mean that's disgusting the glasses were  up her ass and you wouldn't want to put your glasses on up there in her cunt i don't think so give me a  glass eye thank god sammy wasn't there she put the glass eye out and put her asshole and shoved it back  it's peeking around she could manipulate it where it looks like it's looking following you around 
[03:40:00]  the room there's certain things like if you go to thailand there's things that strippers do which  when did it go from sexy to just well that's a talent right right a trick or something like no one's  ever seen a woman shoot a dart out of a cunt and pop a balloon and gone that is amazing  fucking hell that's all i want to masturbate we've seen yeah yeah we've seen a girl throw eggs from  her vagina i know it's interesting but you don't get it it's not sexy no it's not fucking it's amazing 
[03:40:30]  it is amazing we had one of these uh you know stripper uh bachelorette bachelor girls come by  and she would throw eggs from her vagina she had a little hip motion but still it was uh pretty amazing  we would swing at him with a wiffle ball but that's like as sexy as watching you know a magician  it's it's there's nothing there's nothing hot about it but it's still cool as well but it's also  when if you've ever fished a girl when you fish to go there's a bit like wow well i've done that now  but then there's another bit where is she proud of herself or really disappointed in the slackness 
[03:41:00]  of her vagina am i the only one in the room that has never fisted a girl probably yeah you're fisted  of course i have yeah you know what i worry about my fingernails i worry that my nails are going to  cut the inside of it that's the weird thing i worry about yeah it's always like a few fingers and then  your brain it's never like you go into like you walk into a place like today fisting it's it's always a  spare of the moment like i could get three and there's four is it creepy of course it's creepy 
[03:41:30]  is it creepy to do no because what what they like about it or some of them like about is when your four  fingers are in and your thumb goes in it's almost like picture you're picking up a penny all your  fingers are together and then when you start to talk about curling it into a fist they get crazy  like uh like you tell them i'm starting to make they're like oh my god i'm getting fisted like  there's something so taboo about it oh i never i've never fished like i've always just kept the hand  like yeah but then you curl it into a fist yeah and then you're like that that monkey that went to grab

[03:54:00]  no no no that's that's um that's the ashes and remnants of mike python when he had money you know  we have to rebuild rebuild you had people walking around and cleaning and doing things like that  kids running around those are the numbers of my family oh really geez you're sure rude  hey a place like that do you design it or does your wife design or do you have designers and just  say just whatever you guys want to do and make it look nice well you know at first it was my um my 
[03:54:30]  lust um laboratory at one time but then i got married and she put the woman marriage touch on  it and i don't even know what place i live in oh man she just took over yeah it took over all lust  laboratory the lust laboratory the lust lab that sounds it's nice to know what happens to all of us it  doesn't matter how masculine you are who you are that when you fall in love they just take over it  it's nice to know what happens to even guys like mike listen man listen we don't know anything about 
[03:55:00]  this masculinity thing we just know we're supposed to define us as men right now but we don't know  where it comes from we don't know anything about it and if we didn't call it masculinity what would we  call it be whipped yeah yeah exactly yes yes and mike someone was just telling me your one-man show was  really good and it wasn't because they knew you were calling in they just brought it up hey um  um as as as james buster douglas used to say apropos of nothing that was his thing tell me about 
[03:55:30]  that word again apropos of nothing or or or maybe that was ronaldo snipes i can't remember which  which heavyweight from the 80s would use that one apple poe the apple b which one is  apple poe apple b if i slow down off i'll fuck it up so i have to just put one of those names you have to  blow through it like like like an nba player that's from kazakhstan you know tell me about  the guy from boxing in kazakhstan is kicking everybody there oh yeah gorky gorky something 
[03:56:00]  yeah middle middle name middleweight yeah yeah gorky yeah those guys just need to pick up like like  sugar or something like in their middle name yeah this guy's knocking out everyone destroying everyone  and the problem is i've talked to like i've talked to boxing analysts about this guy and they're like  yeah that russian kid's pretty good you need a catchy name yeah well no one can say the guy's name  yeah i can't even i'm only i'm from a gorky park i'm just you know gorky gorky 
[03:56:30]  no it's easy he's the manu ginobili of of middleweights ginobili no i bet it's one of  i that's the whole point we can't figure this if someone go online you'll figure out the guy's name  he's the most he's most dominant guy in boxing right now but no one can pronounce his name  so like fucking drago from rocky hey what are you looking for i'm talking about dominant way he's  hurting people middleweight yeah he's really hurting people body shots hey what are you shooting like i 
[03:57:00]  know you're shooting in new york when are you actually filming oh did you film ready we just  film last night was our last night oh last oh show your show that's gonna be oh that's i was  i was in i was in los angeles last night for hbo how'd it go it went wonderful for the one-man  show let's do the truth and i think air be uh hbo is by eric yeah it's gonna of course they will  that's fantastic man mike's you know i saw mike like three or four years ago he was heavy he was 
[03:57:30]  depressed he was shuffling like he was you know like the old boxer shuffle you know and he looked  like an old blues singer who's done i was singing some old blues back then and then i saw him three  years later and he was like spry and light and in great shape like it was absolutely an amazing  transformation yeah well i wanted to live i got tired of wanting to die and i wanted to live  because i was trying to die but it just didn't work so let's try to live this stuff again and see 
[03:58:00]  what happens so you're loving the live performances you're you're loving being out in front of the  audiences yeah i'm adam and all actually being entertainer yourself i just love being you know it's  being acknowledged you know by my peers and people who do the same thing i do at no occupation and  because they know the difficulty of it and um that's what i appreciate more than anything people  my peers understand the difficulty of it and see and still they see that i achieved so will you take 
[03:58:30]  a break now from the show or are you actually going to bring it on the road a little bit i believe my  wife said we're going to do it in november and december okay good good and are you have you updated  it at all you know not that you really need to i mean because i thought it was i've seen it twice  and it's great but when i saw um some of the filming from the hbo and uh man it looks so much different  it looks beautiful see how you like it yeah yeah i never saw it in that kind of footage footage before  well i i mean i i appreciate you calling on my birthday man i i didn't realize you tape last night 
[03:59:00]  i just came in back into new york this morning but uh it means a lot hey man listen man um i really  appreciate you um during the time of need when we first started promoting this show and you were behind  it 100 and i know um just by the way you're pushing it it was more than just a job and i really  appreciated that you know no problem man don't ever don't hesitate to ask and i really respect  you as a human being that's a nice guy to have thank you uh iron mike tyson thank you buddy for 
[03:59:30]  your birthday wish to jimmy yeah i'm bringing my i'm bringing my trunks and my water wings and i'll  see you soon take it easy man take care bye bye that's uh the champ iron mike tyson it's funny  when i first heard the voice i thought it sounds like tyson but i'm like it can't be tight  like you know i just no but here's how you know everyone is the person if they're if it sounds  like tyson but not enough like tyson the guys are doing tyson impersonations say indubitably  right right and they and they work like they they expend energy they push and they say the buzz they 
[04:00:00]  have their three or four buzz words words and that then they're doing tyson and he sounded like it was  just talking casual yes conversation and now i gotta find this guy's name i gotta i gotta tell  your guy all right all right uh russian or yeah he's russian but you know not russian russian one  of the republics uh around i don't by the way i'm i used to when i grew up there was just russia 
[04:00:30]  and then egypt was like arabian nights like a size of a camel you know the guy with a turban and  a flying carpet and stuff what the fuck has gone on now everything is divvied up into separate  little and they're all fighting and you never heard of any of these stands and everything and  the guy's russian but he's he's darker than a kenyan and you're like what the  fuck and he's declared a fatwa and you're like what but no yeah by the way i hope you're not sending  any brides out from this neck of the woods because my idea of a russian bride is you know completely 
[04:01:00]  different than this by the way the guy's name is uh gennady golovkin golovkin gennady golovkin i  mean and when you read it you can't gennady golovkin is the best pound for pound guy in the world but  no one no no it's uh it's kennedy i i that's the point i just made it up i don't know yeah i do ask  i want to see how confident he wants to differentiate you just you can't say it so he doesn't you know he 
[04:01:30]  doesn't uh get as much doesn't roll out the time right he doesn't watch a lot of boxing i don't  watch it anymore after ufc like i can't like guys like tyson all those guys that like excited you  because they're who they were like i can't find any boxers i really connect with me mayweather's the  only one it's a little like once you discovered hardcore porn going back to sort of skinamax like  hey stockings right some side boob i wonder if they're really doing it yeah it's a little of that yes  and but any port in a storm you know but still that you're looking for your next ufc fight i got 
[04:02:00]  it i gotta talk to you about your uh your podcast and sure and uh as opposed to regular radio as they  call it um do you think you'd still be on the air on regular radio uh saying what you've been saying  over the the past years because and it's nothing believe me but people deem it controversial and  crazy oh um yeah i don't know i you know i used to say a lot of fucked up things yeah yeah on the  air all the time and so i never you know i don't it's it's weird but we're kind of in a different 
[04:02:30]  place now it's so fucking weird now i i know i but i don't think we're i don't think people are more  sensitive i think people are bigger douchebags and they just grab it first off there's a  a there's a couple things it's a technology thing back when we used to do terrestrial radio  back in the day you'd say shit but someone would have to send a cassette yeah program director like 
[04:03:00]  listen minute hour three minute 18 21 seconds he makes a weird ching chong joke when he's talking  about chinese food i want you to review this but he'd never get to it and no one would ever figure it  now there's a technology which is everyone grabs stuff everyone has their own official page that  looks like some kind of news page but it's just them and their shitty apartment with a hot plate  and they're banging it out on their mac yes but and it's like from world news and and they do this 
[04:03:30]  thing and then there's this you know adam carolla racist you know and then they start throwing it out  so a lot of it's just technological you couldn't grab these little bites right and send these files  listen to what he said read the transcript email it to your friends you know it didn't exist so now  it's a a combination of everyone being super sensitive although they don't give a  shit no they're just trying to get you in trouble of course they're not even the group whatever group 
[04:04:00]  you've offended they're not even in that fucking group they don't know anyone in that group they  never had sex with anyone in that group but they're trying it's this whole schadenfreude thing  we're like everyone's trying to get everyone into trouble did you hear oh i mean oh did you oh  man uh did you hear what alec baldwin what the way he spoke to his daughter oh my god it's like yeah  really that's a that's a two and a half to anyone who's ever grown up with parents you know or  whose dad who got pissed off right it's nothing and then and then here's the thing then then it's all 
[04:04:30]  over the news and all the pussy hypocrite cowards have to sit there and go and they look that shocked  look on their face like and when i heard that call i was shocked there's not one guy sitting  in good morning america going i don't know what the big whoop is yeah my dad used to beat me with a  shoe yeah like now they just go oh my goodness feigned outrage outrage it's righteous indignation 
[04:05:00]  and then you get to be on the happy side of the issue you see you get to be on the good side of  the issue and whenever this stuff comes up whether it's trayvon martin trial or whatever the zimmerman  whatever and everyone just sits there and goes oh my god i don't know what to tell my kids and then  and now you're on the happy side and meanwhile you're going we need to start a dialogue about i'm i'm a huge  pussy so i'm not going to say anything but someone should have a dialogue some there needs to be a  national dialogue on alec baldwin they're not going to say anything that's not towing the company line 
[04:05:30]  ever right but so and by the way they're just suggesting everybody it's like it's like standing  next to a burning barn going someone needs to put that barn out somebody's got to pick up a bucket with  some with somebody uh we need to start a national dialogue on putting that barn out they continue to  to throw gasoline on it and talk about whoever set the barn on fire and try to get them in more  trouble for like did you see him he i saw he was throwing hay on it right and then and then once 
[04:06:00]  in a while a guy comes around he goes well honestly we don't have enough wells dug in the community and  we need to start okay listen troublemaker i'm focusing on the barn over here you're you're trying to  violate the soil you're part of the problem you're a soil right yeah everyone's just a hypocrite and a  pussy and they can fuck themselves they love getting people in trouble uh people and when  they say a dialogue should be started the second you start an honest dialogue did people crawl out  of the woodwork to call you racist and homophobic and and misogynistic there's no honest open dialogue 
[04:06:30]  in this country you're crucified the second you're honest about anything i've been on twitter talking  about the zimmerman trial for fucking ever since it started and i can't tell you how many times i've  been called a racist for doing nothing but quoting fact that is going right about in this case and and  statistics no one wants to hear statistics no black well not not when it gets in the way of of their 
[04:07:00]  emotional argument yeah and and look the only if you approach every problem like i mean if if a  if a doctor comes to you and says uh you have emphysema and you need to quit smoking you don't  attack the doctor he's giving you information you know it's my it might not be information you you  care to hear right but it's information and if we're trying to cure a problem you know if you have  gout or whatever you have and he's telling you take it easy on the red wine you don't go fuck that  guy that doctor is horrible yeah let's run him out of town no it's there is a problem there is a remedy 
[04:07:30]  for the problem and we should attempt to fix the problem but if you attack the the doctor who gives  you the news or the you know look everyone wants to be on the cheeseburger diet but the guy's going  to come in and go look you got to eat a salad every once in a while and if we attack him we're not  going to cure the obesity problem but and that's the honest dialogue we want to have we claim to want  to have is with the doctor but he gets run out of out of town the second he tells you to eat some 
[04:08:00]  kale yeah because again nobody really wants an honest dialogue they want to hear their side of  it nobody nobody makes a living off of the right yeah yeah it's uh astounding to me i i've been  watching uh the the coverage of the the zimmerman uh trial and and the aftermath and the revisionist  history that's taken place in only a couple of days is amazing there's no more nothing not a word on 
[04:08:30]  the news that he ever laid a hand on george zimmerman now it's he was walking he was black  he's an innocent boy walking with his skittles and zimmerman followed him and shot him that's the  dialogue now that's all you hear now well it's like first off the news you know these guys are going to  get somebody killed yes because of their misreporting and what happens is we're busy people have one ear  available one eyeball available we're not really that tuned into other people's shit you're kind 
[04:09:00]  of into your own family your own work your own business uh the hookers whatever you got going on  now jim right rolling online for prostitutes like whatever you're i need to just bring him in you're  you're into you're into that so you turn on the news and it's just pretty much well black guy walking  with skittles white guy shoots him in the back for no apparent reason and all right let's go burn down a  liquor store but it was the same thing look it happens time and time again when when there was 
[04:09:30]  that poor kid who uh jumped off the tallahachie bridge because his roommate was he was gay right  and they accused his roommate of filming him with his gay partners and then putting it up on the  internet didn't hear about the gw right yeah and then having parties why it was nothing of the sort uh-huh  and the guy the guy was not a criminal and the guy was not homophobic and the guy was not everything  the kid was depressed and the kid jumped off a bridge and and he was gay and apparently his dad 
[04:10:00]  wasn't happy about the fact he was gay so we can have a dialogue about teen suicide and about how to  prevent teen suicide but we're not going to have that dialogue no about depression and 19 year olds 19  year olds don't kill themselves because they got a crappy roommate i would have killed myself 2 000 times  by now they kill themselves because they're clinically depressed yeah but we had to turn this young  indian like science student into a homophobic gay bashing monster murderer and everyone wanted his 
[04:10:30]  head on a stick and then at the very end so what happens is you talk to the year goes by and you go  remember that story ah yeah where that guy had the homophobic roommate who pushed him off the bridge  and it's like no that's not what happened that has nothing to do with the story and even at the  end when the guy went to trial they didn't have anything on him because there wasn't anything so  the judge said all right we don't we don't have anything just admit you're homophobic and we'll let 
[04:11:00]  you go and the guy was like no i'm not homophobic just admit it just admit like oh well i can sleep at night  yeah it's insane like you're homophobic you're xenophobic you're misogynist yet no one's ever laid  a hand on anyone no one's done anything to anyone it's a perception of it i'll tell you that much  so fucking sad perceiving but here's the thing that pisses me off the most none of those people  even give a shit they don't think that little kid's homophobic no they don't think george zimmerman's 
[04:11:30]  white like they don't even know they just have a story and they have to turn it into something they  love it it's uh the news attainment cycle that goes on has nothing to do with actual news and  then you get these stations like hln which used to be headline news for cnn and it was kind of the 20  minute cycle and they would give you the headlines and then you'd go to cnn if you want a more in-depth  whatever uh now hln it's not headline news anymore it's just hln it's still under the cnn flag but it 
[04:12:00]  has nothing to do with news it's it's nancy grace yelling her opinion hey hey that guy is good  her backwards ass opinion on shit and uh it's it's still disguise people think it's the news  i i i'd say more about it but i have a lawsuit against them for the jody arias trial because  you've ruined my relationship with my wife because it's she's wrapped up the last nine 
[04:12:30]  19 months of her life laying in bed watching a woman who's killed her husband killed her and like  this is it this yeah we're done we're done going on with life because a chick who was a seven  shot a dude in the shower and stabbed that's it what if i just quit my life to watch a trial  she she was fully involved oh my god i'd give jody an eight though did you see those  fucking fat pussy lips in those photos you gotta jump up to an eight okay anyone that hits their  husband with a hammer and has a fat pussy is an eight you like that all right but i'm just saying 
[04:13:00]  it's you know once in a while an attractive woman kills somebody let's get over it yeah yeah move  forward we can't believe it though that's the problem is we we don't like to admit that we can't  it's like it's like why people were surprised susan boyle could sing because we expect nothing out of  pigs so right what can attractive person does it we're utterly shocked what are you doing casey anthony  very attractive yeah no i know i know it's so sad yeah yeah fat people we expect to commit  homicides for some reason they're just unpleasant it's so true though when you see like um you know 
[04:13:30]  a teacher out of florida had sex with her 15 year old student you wait to reserve your judgment until  you see the picture of the chick and if she's hot and blonde and sitting on a harley davidson you're  like what's the big wall yeah there's no but if she's a pig you're like oh that kid's life has been  destroyed here's my art my argument is always the same argument like if if if i was ever  her defense attorney i would take the 15 now six year old boy up to the stand who was banging the 
[04:14:00]  super hot blonde you know chick and who was his teacher in florida and just go look uh your honor  every ladies and gentlemen of the court i'm not going to waste a lot of time here all i have is one  simple question uh it's been a year since you two had uh intercourse have you beat off to her since  remember you're under oath all right and would you say being 2000 or under okay ladies and gentlemen 
[04:14:30]  how can there be a crime what right vehicular manslaughter you don't beat off to if you beat  off to this moving on moving on to the next case how can you be how can you be traumatized by something  you beat off to like yeah you get carjacked well you might beat off to it yeah someone holds you  up at an atm you don't you're not gonna do it oh that's great i love these guys my head she's in jail  and they're beating off to uh what when the crime occurred yeah and and that's true though reserving 
[04:15:00]  judgment do that all the time i want to see the second i see the headline i click on the link i'm like  i want to see the picture first i want to see if she's hot right that blonde on the  fucking motorcycle she was like yeah incredibly hot i know and you're like oh like where does that  where does that happen i don't know what magic no i i had like mr saponzi the fat guy with the  male pattern baldness and the sweater vest and stuff like it smelled weird like where where these  teachers even come from teachers why can i tell you this i went to my kid i have twins i went to their
