<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts and Nicole from the morning mashup.  This pre-show heavily featured a recap of the previous day's show, focusing on Anthony's alleged confession to wearing his mother's shoes as a child.  Lady Di, a frequent caller known for her shocking revelations, was also a major topic.  Her previous day's call, detailing past crack cocaine use with inconsistent timelines, sparked much discussion and speculation, along with her past financial troubles and accusations of theft. The Donald Sterling racism scandal received significant attention, with clips from the controversial audio recording being played and analyzed.  The hosts criticized the woman who released the recording, calling her a "twat" for potentially setting Sterling up.  The pre-show also announced that Louis Black would be a guest on the main show, discussed Jim Norton's new Vice.com talk show, and included calls from superfans, one mentioning a "slobbo" sign at a WWE event.  The Paul Simon/Edie Brickell domestic dispute and arrest was also briefly mentioned.

The main show began with a humorous bit, possibly from *The Jerky Boys*, about anal hygiene.  The discussion then shifted back to the leaked Donald Sterling audio, focusing on the legality of the recording and its release, before returning to Lady Di and her conflicting accounts of crack cocaine use. A caller, Greg from Texas, provided context for another audio recording, suggesting it involved an elderly "sugar daddy" and a younger escort, framed as a racial issue by the woman.  The conversation further explored the legality of recording conversations, referencing Dog the Bounty Hunter. The hosts continued to analyze the Donald Sterling controversy, speculating on motivations and consequences.  They then discussed Shaq's mocking of a disabled fan's selfie, playing audio from a news report and debating its appropriateness.  This included discussing the actions of other celebrities involved in similar incidents.  Joel McHale joined the show in studio, discussing his upcoming White House Correspondents' Dinner hosting gig, potential jokes, and the pressures involved.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, advertisements, and a mention of Joe Piscopo.

The next segment featured comedian Lewis Black.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, discussed Jim Norton's physical transformation (weight loss), their uncertain listener numbers on SiriusXM, and Lewis Black's experiences performing at high-profile events, including the White House Correspondents' Dinner, comparing it to performing in a "creepy fucking room" and referencing Will Rogers.  They also discussed Lewis Black's upcoming benefit for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, mentioning participating celebrities like John Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg, and Joy Behar, along with challenges in securing footage from Christopher Walken.  An anecdote about Mickey Rooney requesting a joke was shared. The evolving sensitivities around language, particularly the use of offensive words like "tranny," was discussed. The Donald Sterling controversy was revisited, speculating on the reactions of other NBA owners.  The Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappearance received a brief, dismissive comment.  Lewis Black shared anecdotes about his international touring experiences and his upcoming Pixar movie role, voicing the anger inside a 12-year-old girl.  Joe Piscopo was mentioned again as a guest performing in Scottsdale. The entire show was punctuated by frequent profanity and vulgar language.  Several callers contributed to the discussions, including Tony in Michigan and Birdman on Long Island, with a caller identifying himself as a member of Stormfront.org participating in the Donald Sterling segment.  The discussions frequently included racial slurs and offensive language.  The show also touched upon welfare statistics and racial disparities in crime reporting, with callers offering varying, often heated and contradictory viewpoints.  Charles Barkley's and Jamie Foxx's comments on race were briefly mentioned.  A morality clause in Sterling's contract was also discussed.

Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Yeah! Welcome, welcome. How are we all doing?  It's the pre-show, the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Counting down the minutes before the big Tuesday Opie and Anthony show begins. 
[00:01:30]  We are live, so call the show.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Call us now, and you too can be a part of the Opie and Anthony pre-show  as we go over everything that's going to be going down today.  Tornadoes that are killing Americans 
[00:02:00]  couldn't knock Donald Sterling out of the headlines.  He's sharing the headlines, but they couldn't knock him out of the headlines.  I don't know what will. The guy's in a lot of trouble.  We'll get to all that, and everything that went down on yesterday's show as well.  Because, of course, we learn from our mistakes,  and everything we do properly here on the Opie and Anthony show.  So, let's get into it. 
[00:02:30]  Yesterday's show is what I want to start with.  The part that had me laughing all night,  because I just kept visualizing it,  was Anthony's inadvertent admission.  Yes, he was talking about his childhood.  And I believe this was a confession.  I don't think that he wanted to make the confession,  but I do believe that Ant was letting us in on a private part of his life  when yesterday he brought up his mommy's shoes. 
[00:03:00]  Let's go to the track.  What do you think? It takes seven-year-olds for shots?  That's true. They're a little young.  They're extremely young.  That's true.  They're barely talking.  Or if he wants to play with a dolly or put, like, mommy's shoes on,  you tell him that's what the shot's for.  Wait. Did you put mommy's shoes on?  No, I never put mommy's shoes on.  No?  And I never played with a dolly. It was a puppet.  Did you put mommy's shoes on?  I didn't have strings on it yet.  You put mommy's shoes?  No, I never put mommy's shoes on.  Anthony put mommy's shoes on.  I never put mommy's shoes on.  Why would you bring it up like that?  Because it's something that...  Because you were sort of referring to yourself there. 
[00:03:30]  No, no, no, because it's something that kids...  Because you did the doll's thing without the strings.  No, because if I was saying you would do that  to try to keep your child from being sexually confused,  and all it would do is sexually confuse him.  See, that was the twist.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  I never put mommy's shoes.  I never put mommy's shoes on.  Anthony put on mommy's shoes.  I would absolutely tell you if I put on mommy's shoes.  I don't know about that.  Sam, you put on mommy's shoes?  No, I never did.  I never put on mommy's shoes. 
[00:04:00]  I think somebody in the room did.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  No.  I don't think it was the opster.  Oh, I'd be honest.  I never put on mommy's shoes.  There was never...  Why?  What's wrong with you?  Because there wasn't even an inkling.  Right.  I never put on mommy's shoes.  Did you break the heels in them?  No.  Because you didn't know how to walk properly?  No.  Did you slide around because they were so big?  That's why your father would always yell at you.  We were like, why would his father always call him gay?  Because he had like a puppet.  But that's what it was.  It was a doll.  And you were walking around.  You were like the little girl from Sixth Sense doing your little play. 
[00:04:30]  Like, oh, look, the little puppet show.  And you had on mommy's shoes.  And your father's trying to give you a soup with poison in it.  No, I must say, I never had even the slightest urge to put on mommy's shoes.  Comment, Sam.  Did you put on her earrings when you had the shoes on?  No, I didn't have the shoes or the underpants or earrings.  None of that.  Did you mistake her back massager as a big fake cigar and walk around?  Put it in your mouth and walk around like you were smoking a cigar, mommy. 
[00:05:00]  Back massager.  Mommy's shoes.  In mommy's shoes.  Mommy's shoes.  I never put on mommy's shoes.  Put on mommy's shoes.  But she didn't like when he would run out when company was there with the fake cigar and say,  why cigars smell like doo-doo?  Did she put it there?  Because he was 16.  Inappropriate.  Well, the phones are already on fire.  And they're not on fire because everybody wants to talk about aunt's mommy shoes. 
[00:05:30]  I believe that he wore his mom's shoes at one point or another.  I mean, we've all heard the stories about aunt.  He had his puppets.  He was a creative child.  He wasn't one of the athletes.  He was one of the creatives.  And he cried a lot.  He was a sensitive boy.  I don't think that it's something that he did throughout his entire childhood.  But I think maybe once, as a young boy, he might have put on his mom's heels.  Who cares?  Who cares?  There's only one person that the entire pre-show audience apparently wants to hear about. 
[00:06:00]  Except for Snowy.  Snowy, I see you and I'll get to you.  But I guess we're going to start with Psycho Bob.  What's up, Psycho Bob?  Hey, Sam.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, I just was listening to the post show from yesterday.  And did I hear correctly?  Was Lady Di born on April 1st?  She was indeed.  That is her birthday.  How appropriate is that?  It is beyond appropriate, Psycho Bob.  Lady Di was a part of the post show yesterday because she called in to O&A for no apparent reason. 
[00:06:30]  But she does this.  She calls in for no reason and then we learn about her.  More than...  I don't know how there could still be new information pouring out about her.  But it started with her story about the liquor store.  where she decided to attend.  And we didn't know where this was going.  We never do with her.  But boy, did it go somewhere.  Let's play how the clip started.  Let's go to track 10, E-Rock. 
[00:07:00]  I had to go to another liquor store.  By the way, I had to get a plug.  It's 10 a.m.  Why, did you pass a bad check at the other place?  Oh, you're a dead beast.  No, they were closed.  It was Sunday.  So you had to find a liquor store that's open on a Sunday.  Yeah, you don't have a club.  And I know exactly where it was.  Of course you did.  The liquor gallery on Amore Avenue.  The liquor gallery.  She goes to the gallery.  The liquor gallery.  I don't know why that's funny, but it is. 
[00:07:30]  It sounds like a horrible place.  I went to the liquor gallery.  Who refers to the liquor store by the actual name of the store?  Right, no one.  Then you just go, I'm going to the liquor store.  I'm going to the liquor store.  No, because that's like everything to her, man.  Yeah.  It was open later than everyone else.  Please tell us the hours that they're open, because I think our audience needs to know  when they can get liquor at the liquor gallery.  The liquor gallery is open.  Of course he's going to answer that.  10 at night.  And then after that, I found out my friend Ronnie.  You guys remember him? 
[00:08:00]  Who?  No.  Oh, Ronnie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I swear I have no idea where Ronnie is.  Yeah.  You have no idea?  No.  Yes.  He was the guy that, seriously, they know him as Ponytail around No More Avenue.  Oh, Ponytail.  Around what?  Did you believe this conversation?  Can you believe?  How do you remember to?  Ponytail down on fucking. 
[00:08:30]  Okay, of course.  Ponytail.  Why would we know this or give a shit?  Does he hang out at the liquor gallery, though?  Yeah.  Can you find him at the liquor gallery?  He works there.  Yeah.  Oh, so Ponytail what?  Harry?  He works.  So Ponytail Harry works at the liquor gallery?  Ronnie works at the liquor gallery.  But who's Ponytail?  What about his brother, Harry?  Well, no, his nickname, Ronnie's nickname is Ponytail, because he always has a ponytail.  Blowjob per six-pack?  Did you understand that, Aunt? 
[00:09:00]  She's explaining to you why his nickname is Ponytail.  Oh, wow.  I wonder why.  I wonder why.  Lady Di, and she never quite understands where we're going.  I mean, the weird thing about her, she never understands where we're going with anything.  She always has to insert something that nobody's talking about, but always comes up with something  that just leaves the room jaws agape.  And that's difficult to do in this room.  Jason in Chicago.  Hey, professional broadcaster Sammy Roberts. 
[00:09:30]  Where can I donate money to help Lady Di in her heroin addiction that we now just found out about?  Well, I don't know if it's heroin, because what we found out yesterday, and besides that,  I wouldn't donate any money, because she's not going to do anything good with it.  Go to the liquor gallery.  Yeah, go to the liquor gallery, and leave a gift certificate in her name.  Something like that.  That's about as much donating as you're going to be able to do.  It wasn't heroin that we found out about yesterday.  E-Rock, why don't you play the clip and let the audience know what we did find out about Lady Di on yesterday's show. 
[00:10:00]  Did you take out more money from the ATM than Bill told you?  I did.  All right.  All right.  Now, why did you do this?  I did it to have a few drinks over at the lamplight.  How much more did you take out than he said to take out?  $60.  $60 more?  What a fucking piece of shit. 
[00:10:30]  Are you buying crack?  No!  A lot of people are saying, hold on.  Hold on.  Bob's going to get involved here.  Bob in Illinois.  He knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  Bob, go ahead.  This track can't be, Avery.  When's the last time you smoked crack, Lady Di?  Tell us when the last time was.  The last time I smoked crack was...  Liar.  Right now, about three.  No, I'm not lying.  Liar.  Let me finish.  Hold on.  I want to hear what she said.  Three years ago.  How many? 
[00:11:00]  Three years ago.  Holy shit.  She smokes crack.  It all makes sense now.  She smokes crack.  Bob, you're a fucking genius.  Now.  Because there's no way she smoked crack three years ago and then just stopped.  And stopped, right.  There's no fucking way without any help.  She's still smoking crack.  And that's why you got robbed outside the chicken place.  You were trying to cop some crack.  Oh, Bob, you're a genius.  You were trying to cop crack.  That's why she got so sick when she was here because she needed crack and that's why she  stole 60 bucks from fucking Bill. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  For crack.  Oh.  Because that whole, you know, getting ripped off was way too...  Fishing.  It was a little too fishy and shady because we know she doesn't like eating in general.  So why would she all of a sudden be at a chicken place?  Excuse me.  I love eating when I'm hungry.  You probably went there for Bill, but then you're like, well, I could use his money for  some crack, so I'm going to get my crack, do my thing, and then now I need an excuse  for Bill, so I'll just tell him I got robbed.  I got mugged. 
[00:12:00]  No.  Or she got robbed by a crack dealer.  Lady Di, there's no way you were smoking crack three years ago and you just stopped  cold turkey.  There's no way.  Yeah.  There is a way.  So you were smoking crack three years ago.  When was the last time you smoked crack, Di?  Sam, Sam, listen to me.  Yeah.  The only time that you're addicted is when you're actually doing it.  I think that comes right out of an AA handbook.  The only time you're addicted is when you're actually doing it.  I think that's just one day at a time and the only time you're addicted is when you're 
[00:12:30]  actually doing it.  Now, as we said, Lady Di stuck around for the pre-show.  She just stays on hold when she's on hold.  So I picked her up and I was talking to her a little bit about it.  But something that happened, I mean the post-show, yesterday, something that happens with  the post-show is, like for instance, yesterday, it was six minutes long.  So my head's all over the place.  Bobo's on the phone.  Lady Di's on the phone.  Nicole from the morning mashup is in studio.  Certain details slipped by me. 
[00:13:00]  But there was one detail that did not slip by, that slipped by me, but didn't slip by the  listeners.  Scott in New Jersey?  What's going on, Sam?  How's it going?  If you listen to, she's saying that she hasn't done it in three years.  Right before Bobo starts talking, she says she hasn't done it in over a year.  Big B in Lexington, Kentucky.  Yeah, I got the same thing that she didn't do it for three years, squaring up and down. 
[00:13:30]  But then she went for two years with you and the lovely Nicole, and then she went with  Bobo to a year.  She ain't done it the past year.  She's smoking crack.  She's down there.  She's fucking bitch for crack.  Lou in New Jersey.  Sammy, good morning.  Morning.  Yeah, I was agreeing with all the rest of the callers.  She said she spent her father's inheritance on it.  Her father passed away in 2012. 
[00:14:00]  That's 2014.  So that's two years.  And then a couple nights later, it's one year.  I really do hope that she gets better.  I think her friend Marion, once again, had no problem throwing her under the bus.  All her comments.  Yeah, Marion really does have no problem throwing Lady Di under the bus.  But that is the clip.  And I'm going to give that to Opie and Anthony later on on today's show, because I'd like  to hear what their take on it.  I re-listened to the post show.  And yeah, Cameron in Dallas, what did you hear? 
[00:14:30]  Hey, yes.  Yesterday on the post show, right before you let Bobo on the phone, Lady Di said that it's  just been over a year since she smoked crack.  So that three-year bullshit's a lie.  That's exactly, I re-listened to the clip, and at the end of the post show, she says,  it's been over a year since I smoked crack.  And I felt like I was losing my grip on things.  I couldn't believe that one slipped by me.  I'm very upset with myself that it slipped by me. 
[00:15:00]  So I will offer that up on a silver platter to the Opie and Anthony show today.  Because I was going to Bobo, and she just spits that out.  So I don't know what Lady Di's problem is, but the Lady Di saga continues today on the  Opie and Anthony show.  Speaking of sagas that are going to be continuing, also, big guest on the Opie and Anthony show  today, Louis Black is going to be on the show.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Louis Black, who's got such a deep history with the show. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, he got arrested, did he not?  He got arrested as part of the voyeur bus way back when on WNAW.  I'm surprised there hasn't been more voyeur bus stuff with all our 20th anniversary mumbo-jumbo  that we've been doing.  I'm sure we'll get to it as the year continues.  But Louis Black has been arrested for the Opie and Anthony show.  He's been doing the show forever, and he makes his big return.  I mean, at one time he was in this studio and got into a stare-down and a yell-off with 
[00:16:00]  Rampage Jackson.  It was the scariest thing.  I believe we have a photo.  Maybe we'll put it on the Twitter in a little bit.  E-Rock will go through the archives and find it.  It hangs in our office.  It was hanging, yeah.  We hung a copy of it up in our office because they were yelling face-to-face.  It's the only time I've ever seen Louis Black quiet down somewhat.  But that will be later today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Louis Black in studio.  In the meantime, we were talking about sagas.  The Lady Dies saga continuing.  Well, Donald Sterling's saga is going nowhere. 
[00:16:30]  We, of course, got into the Donald Sterling recorded conversation gate.  They don't have a gate for it yet.  Sterling gate?  Clipper gate?  I don't know.  We got into it yesterday.  Here's how it started.  Let's go to track two.  She knows that he's probably, I don't know for sure, but he's probably have said horrendous  things.  So now she just needs a little of that on tape.  You could set him up.  She knows the key words to set him off. 
[00:17:00]  Minority.  Racism.  Right, right.  But there's a culture.  People steal certain things.  There's blackers steal certain things towards black.  Blacks steal certain things towards other groups.  It's been that way historically, and it will always be that way.  But it's not that way in my heart and in my mind.  But maybe you want to adjust to the world.  But why?  The world doesn't do anything for me, and they don't make me happy.  You're like, I don't want to argue with you. 
[00:17:30]  I don't want to argue.  I can't be racist in my heart.  And that's good.  I'm living in a culture, and I have to live within the culture.  You know, even though she is baiting him completely, the things she's saying are not so crazy.  It's like she's kind of throwing softballs out there, and man, he's cranking up and hitting  him out of the park.  He's nailing him, yeah.  Yeah, because things like you've got to adjust to the culture.  It's like, yeah, you're a billionaire.  You own the team. 
[00:18:00]  Shut the fuck up.  It was one of those things where, conceptually, you had one idea of it.  It was the same thing with the Clive and Bundy thing that we were talking about last week.  Conceptually, you can be okay with it, but then you start listening to the tape and what  Donald Sterling is actually saying.  And you go, there's really no defense whatsoever.  Let's move on to track three.  We live in a culture.  We have to live within that culture.  But shouldn't we take a stand for what's wrong and be the change and the difference? 
[00:18:30]  I don't want to change the culture because I can't.  It's too big.  But you can change yourself.  I don't want to change it.  My girl can't do what I want.  I don't want the girl.  I'll find a girl that will do what I want.  Believe me.  I thought you were that girl.  Because I try to do what you want.  But you're not that girl.  No blacks that girl.  This guy's in Dutch.  He's having a 17-year-old boy discussion at age 81. 
[00:19:00]  I thought you were that girl.  Wow.  You own a team.  You're talking like a little child.  Your friend told me.  Yeah.  Do you like like me?  And by the way, this whole culture thing and you can't change the culture.  Try fucking weaseling some of this guy's money and watch how fast.  Like, hey, that's just the world we live in.  I wonder if he says that when it's time to pay taxes.  No.  He doesn't go, that's the world we live in.  He goes, well, fuck this.  So we're not doing the fight this and trade that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  So stop.  Come on.  He's in so much trouble.  So overnight, the story continues.  We find out he's losing.  The Clippers are losing sponsors.  The coach is speaking out.  There's going to be a news conference held by the NBA today at 2 p.m.  that they're going to figure out what they can do with them.  Spike Lee is saying terrible things.  The Heat, which is a completely different team altogether, is protesting.  Meta World Peace wants to help him and fix him. 
[00:20:00]  It's amazing.  Everybody's talking about this guy, which is terrible news.  Terrible news for Donald Sterling.  But we'll get into that a little bit later on today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, good.  I was starting to get very worried.  But, ladies and gentlemen, we now introduce superfan Eric.  Oh, Sam Robertson, professional broadcaster.  How the hell are you?  Oh, I'm great now.  How are you?  I'm hanging in there, Sam.  See, the problem with me right now at this time of year, it's flyer playoff time. 
[00:20:30]  Gotcha.  And I get so fired up for the flyers.  And they're up and they're down.  And, you know, I don't want to bring the show down.  So I just got to hang back.  But today's game six.  Flyers are playing.  I'll be at the game.  So you're fired up?  I'm here.  I'm all fired up today.  We're going to bring it back to New York next tomorrow night.  And we're going to do it.  Now, what are you going to be doing today in the meantime during the day?  Well, as you know, I'm a professional hoagie maker.  I'm going to be making hoagies.  It's a great city of Philadelphia.  You make those hoagies.  And one of these days, I'm going to get down there and I'm going to get one of those chicken 
[00:21:00]  cheese steaks.  Oh, dude.  I'll do it for you.  And you know what else I'll do for you, too?  What's that?  Just for you, Sam?  I'll put a little boost in it.  Good, good.  Thank you very much.  You've got to.  I'm going to fire it up.  Say, Sam, room for my flyers tonight, brother.  We want to come back to New York tomorrow night.  Let's do this.  I'm all flyers.  I'm all flyers.  That's what I want to hear.  To my fans, I'm still around, brothers.  I'll talk to you later.  Don't worry.  To all the superfan Eric fans, he's still around.  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey, Samuel.  How are you doing today?  Good, buddy. 
[00:21:30]  How are you?  Before I get to my one point, I told you to the show yesterday, you were talking like  they're giving away these, check out the Antis Mon t-shirts.  Are they going to be giving some of those away?  Yeah, hopefully I'll have time to give them away today, maybe on the post-show.  I got a box with a few of them.  I just didn't have time yesterday because I only had a six-minute post-show.  Yeah, I tried calling to the post-show yesterday.  I heard Opie say about that.  I was like, fuck yeah.  I don't like one of those shirts.  I was like, oh, I'll try to call on the post-show then and get one if it's going to answer a question  or whatever.  I have to admit something.  I don't usually like it when people do the little slobbo thing because I love Iraq myself, actually. 
[00:22:00]  But during that Humble and Fred interview, when their fricking producer or whatever yelled it over the phone,  I had a mouthful of fucking water in my mouth and I almost blasted it on my fucking nose while driving  after hearing that slobbo coming over the phone.  Well, there is one way, thank you Snowy, to ingratiate yourself to the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, we had Humble and Fred on the air yesterday and they figured it out. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  They must have listened to a lot of O&A.  Unless they've always been fans, between last week and yesterday when they called in,  they must have listened to a lot of O&A because they knew exactly what to do.  Listen to, let's go to track five, Eric.  Listen to the way they immediately became a part.  But it was the producer, right?  Yeah, it was him.  So maybe the producer listens to the show?  We'll listen to him from yesterday's show on Humble and Fred, the Canadian show 
[00:23:00]  that we spent all last week destroying, called into the show, and immediately became a part of the family.  That's right.  You guys were on in the afternoon.  Yeah.  So you've got to understand, this was 13 years ago and the frame of mind we were in while we were listening.  Yeah.  So when we made the reference, we just didn't find it funny.  Please appreciate the frame of mind we were in.  Yeah, no, we understand that.  But not everything is funny.  But then you guys were referring to a bit we were doing where girls were pretty much 
[00:23:30]  finger-banging each other.  Something like that, yeah.  And then you're saying, but it wasn't funny.  And I got a little mad because I'm like, that day wasn't supposed to be funny.  That day was supposed to be titillating because you've got to remember back 13, 14 years ago,  we didn't really have the Internet.  So that type of thing absolutely worked on the radio for a while.  It was great, by the way.  Let's be serious.  We're introducing some of the people that we work with.  One of them is Phil, a chubby Asian boy that produces our program. 
[00:24:00]  Blabo!  Oh, shit.  We'll have him figure himself during this segment.  And then, of course, there's Eileen, who your audience was.  Oh.  I believe one of your audiences wanted her to give birth to the fetus and then kill it with  a knitting needle.  A knitting needle?  Despicable people.  I'm trying to figure out how to fuck a bucket of AIDS.  Oh, they're just the worst fans ever. 
[00:24:30]  You've got to admit, Eric, it was a very good placement of a slobo.  Uh-huh.  He's not happy.  He's never like that.  And if you were watching Monday Night Raw last night, you saw a big slobo sign in about  the fifth row.  It was very impressive.  By a big fat guy in a purple shirt.  Well, regardless of who was holding it up, the fact is, it's good promotion for the show,  Eric.  Don't be bitter.  I'm going to show Opie and Anthony photos.  There was some guy who showed up on Monday Night Raw, the WWE's flagship show last night, 
[00:25:00]  with a stack of Opie and Anthony-related signs.  And some of them were hilarious.  But I think the favorite by everybody was the big slobo that popped up halfway through the  show.  It's always good.  It was so funny, too, because E-Rock on his Twitter was encouraging people to bring E-Rock  signs.  And it was as if the guy knew and going, what the fuck is this guy tweeting for people to  bring signs with his name on it?  How about slobo?  How about that one? 
[00:25:30]  And it just looks so good on a poster board.  We'll get into that on today's show.  Let's go to Sonny in Boston.  Hey, Sam.  Listen, I was just thinking about the whole Lady Di situation, about her saying that she  hasn't smoked crack in over a year or whatever it is.  Yeah.  You know, when people start to smoke crack, they usually start off by snorting coke.  And sometimes, you know, the crack addict themselves might just snort coke for a while  just to get the edge off until the next time that they hit the pipe again. 
[00:26:00]  So you think she may be doing blow just to take the edge off?  Yeah, that's right.  You know, so she takes out $60 just to get some blow.  She may not be doing the crack.  Because a lot of crackheads, they feel really bad after doing the crack, you know, after  sucking on the devil's dick.  Ah.  Because, you know, I was a crackhead over 21 years ago.  And, you know, so I'm a recovering addict.  So in your opinion, when you hear Lady Di talking the way she talks, you heard her behavior 
[00:26:30]  during the Lady Di internship week, right?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So, and you heard her yesterday.  First she says three years, then she says one year.  Do you think that she's done with crack?  Oh, absolutely not.  She's fucking lying.  Right, right.  Okay.  That's what I thought.  Thank you, Sonny.  Oh, you're welcome, sir.  Sometimes you've got to go to the expert for their opinion.  Paul in Texas.  What's up, buddy?  Sam Roberts.  What?  Hey, yesterday I was listening to the Humble and Fred show on an O&A commercial break. 
[00:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  And they mentioned that they have some Canadian pop star on, and they were like, today's going  to be a great day for us.  Our ratings should be a good day to be on, because we were just on one of the titans of  American radio, the O&A show.  So I thought that was cool.  It's very cool.  Yeah.  Humble and Fred, it's amazing how things change.  They've gone from talking about how not funny the Opie and Anthony show is to getting very 
[00:27:30]  close to fellating the Opie and Anthony show.  It's always good to see people come around and become friends with the show.  So thank you very much to Humble and Fred.  It was big news yesterday, if you were listening to the show.  Jim had a very big announcement about the future of Jim Norton.  E-Rock, let's go to track eight.  Jimmy's got some exciting news.  Amy kind of mentioned it a while ago by mistake, but it doesn't matter.  It wasn't a giant secret.  Chlamydia?  Yes.  Well, we don't know who gave it to who, because we've never slept together, but we do shake 
[00:28:00]  hands a lot.  That's adorable.  I'm doing a show for Vice.com and Vice Media.  It's a talk show.  It's where I interview people and sketches and whatever, a regular show.  And they're giving me, it's a pilot episode, but I'm getting three episodes to do as kind  of pilots.  And we're shooting here in New York, May the 20th and 21st.  We'll be shooting the episodes, and I will give details on how to get tickets, but I  want O&A fans to try and get tickets first. 
[00:28:30]  I want them to be these fans.  And it's a small studio.  It's where Kamau Bell used to shoot.  So we'll probably have 150, 120 people, which is all I wanted.  They actually wanted to do it in a bigger studio uptown, but I wanted a smaller.  I kind of want more than 120 people.  Right.  That's awesome.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm really excited about it.  It's what I've wanted to do for a long, long time.  No shite.  So we start shooting little things this week and then the next couple weeks.  And I just had to announce it because Vice is putting out a press release today. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Sweet.  Yeah.  That fucking rocks.  Yeah.  I might just hope I don't fuck it up.  Nah.  No.  Come on.  I hope I don't mess it up.  Please don't fuck it up.  I think it'll be great.  It'll be great.  Great, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Nice language freedom.  Damn.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've written some very funny stuff.  Some saucy stuff?  Yeah.  A little saucy?  Yeah, I'm very happy with it.  Are you cheeky in it?  Rather cheeky, yeah.  Could you tell us one?  Oh.  No, but I'll tell you. 
[00:29:30]  I would have to find one that I know we're not shooting.  Because there are a couple.  That they were like, I don't know about it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but they're letting me do pretty much whatever we want to do.  They haven't broken balls about language or content or anything.  But they're like, well, for the first couple, you might want to.  Well, it's tame down.  Yeah.  A little lighter.  Yeah, there's a couple.  You don't want to come in too hot.  So big news in the career of Jim Norton.  Little Jimmy is finally developing a television show. 
[00:30:00]  We know he's been working on it for a long time.  So big congratulations to Jim Norton.  But that's the future.  Let's focus on the present.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Today we continue covering the Donald Sterling saga.  More info on Lady Di.  I can't wait to hear what Opie and Anthony think of the clip from the post show.  Plus, Louis Black in studio.  I'm going to show him all the photos of the slobo. 
[00:30:30]  And there was one chip reference that made it onto Monday Night Raw last night that I thought was goddamn hilarious.  Craig Ferguson is leaving his show.  E-Rock was up all night crying about that.  He's a big Craig Ferguson fan.  I don't know what CBS is going to do.  But I do know this.  We may very well talk about it.  Today on the Opie and Anthony show.  And you won't have to wait any longer to find out.  Because the Opie and Anthony show starts right now. 
[00:31:00]  And you won't have to wait any longer to find out. 
[00:31:30]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:32:00]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:32:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:33:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Oh my God, it was beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:35:00]  We're out of show on the road.  Through 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up.  They've met friends along the way. 
[00:35:30]  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your thoughts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real. 
[00:36:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Good morning, everyone.  There we go.  Welcome.  We just did this.  We kind of just did, right?  What happened?  Oh, I don't know.  Here we go.  We got new stuff to talk about.  Retta, every day something new happens, right?  Isn't that it?  Well, that's the beauty of doing this.  With the oiled. 
[00:36:30]  I'm just laughing my goddamn head off at the headlines today.  Oh, yeah.  I guess Paul Simon and Edie Burkell,  it looks like they just went toe-to-toe for a little while.  Had a little tiff, I guess.  And it also looks like that they're cool with it and used to it.  Yeah.  Because they're basically in court yesterday saying,  hey, man, we're cool.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about us.  We're good.  What a non-issue this is.  They're married over 20 years. 
[00:37:00]  They have an argument over something.  Yeah.  The mother, I guess Edie Burkell's mother, called 911 and then hung up the phone.  Right.  And the cops, you know, they show up anyway.  Yes, they have to at that point.  Yeah, exactly.  And then in Connecticut, there's some kind of, another one of these,  we can't make a decision based on our professionalism and knowledge as to what's going on on site.  It's one of those mandatory, we got to arrest people.  Right.  When they go to a domestic.  Instead of what? 
[00:37:30]  Just sitting there and figuring it out?  And figuring it out.  You know, you split them up.  Okay, what do you do to you?  Okay, what did she say?  Right.  It's mandatory that they have to fucking arrest somebody.  Is it really?  Yeah.  And then it's mandatory for the papers to write stuff like troubled waters.  Oh, like the bridge over.  Right.  I get it.  There were a couple others.  I actually.  There certainly were.  I was so excited and so happy.  I actually tweeted one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sounds of violence.  The sounds of violence. 
[00:38:00]  Get it?  And what was the other one I read?  50 ways to not be good.  Bruise your lover.  Bruise your lover.  They weren't brave enough to say beat your lover.  But they didn't.  They went with 50 ways to bruise your lover.  But there wasn't even a domestic arrest that was disturbing the peace.  They went with that.  The quotes are the best, though.  Edie Brickell, who, you remember her?  She had one hit.  What I am is what I am.  You what you are. 
[00:38:30]  She had a big mouth.  And then Paul Simon decided, wow, that's the girl for me.  She's going to be a huge superstar with a lot of pop songs and a lot of hits.  If I get behind her.  Oh, that's right.  One and done.  So Edie Brickell says, I picked a fight with my husband.  Paul Simon says, 72-year-old guy, and he don't take shit from nobody, says, neither of us has any fear.  Oh, boy.  That must be a hell of a house.  That means...  They're yelling at each other.  I think they wrestle in the morning. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, a little wrestling.  Get on the ground and wrestle around a bit.  Yeah.  This story is great.  Paul and wife in domestic dust-up.  And like you said, it doesn't seem like there's really much here, but...  No, but now because you're married to 20-some-odd years, you get into an argument with your wife, the dumb mother-in-law calls the cops, and now there's a thing.  Now you've got to be run through the system.  Yeah.  You've got to go to court.  That should just be looked at and be like, all right, look.  Yeah.  It's fucking stupid Paul Simon.  I should have read the first sentence of the article.  Guess the marriage is still crazy after all these years. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, they didn't...  Yeah, they went with that one.  Yes, they did.  All right.  All right.  They started a spat in their Connecticut house that got them both arrested for disorderly conduct.  I got my feelings hurt, and I picked a fight with my husband.  Feelings got hurt?  He probably says, look at all my hits.  Look at all my fucking hits.  I guess...  And where's yours?  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  What I am, what I am, I guess you're nobody.  Yeah.  Can we hear what I am at this point, please?  Ba-ding-dee.  It was Peter Brickell and New Bohemians.  Yeah.  I got my feelings hurt, and I picked a fight with my husband, Edie said in a statement.  The police called it disorderly.  Thank God it's orderly now.  There you go.  So.  But now it's just a waste of time, money, and fucking resources to have Paul Simon and  Edie Brickell to have to show up in court. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  It's ridiculous.  We're going to go home and watch our son play baseball now.  There you go.  We had an argument, which is atypical of us.  Neither of us has any fear or any reason to be threatened.  Remember this thing?  Yep.  And she was all cute and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You know this song, Jimmy?  I like this song, yeah.  Who is this?  Edie Brickell.  Oh, this is her?  Yeah.  I thought this chick was young who sang this. 
[00:41:00]  What's that?  This song is, God, this is old.  This song could be 25 years.  Yeah, it's in the 80s, right?  Yeah.  This song could be 25 years old now.  It's going to be late 80s.  That's crazy to think.  She choked me.  Did he choke her in the shallow waters before she got too deep?  Right.  It's 25 years old.  25 years old.  Right on the nose, huh?  1988.  Damn.  So they're celebrating the fact that this song is 25 years old by having a little domestic. 
[00:41:30]  Having a little spat.  I think that's it.  Yeah, it's a long article, but they start describing what they were wearing in court because there's  nothing here.  Nothing there.  Simon, 72, Brickell is 47.  They left the courtroom hand in hand.  Nice.  There you go.  Edie and I are fine.  We love each other.  We had an argument.  That's all.  That's got to suck. 
[00:42:00]  Why couldn't the police do the right thing and go, holy shit, you're Paul Simon.  Yeah.  And who are you?  I almost remember you.  I almost remember you.  Well, look, we don't want to come back here, so we hope you just keep the sounds of silence  going on in this house, okay?  They're dumb song title puns.  Well, you got to do that, you know.  Yeah.  But that was on the front page of one of the papers.  Well, they were very proud of their headlines. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, they had to go with that.  Very proud of that.  So, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you got the Donald Sterling.  That's the big story.  That's the one everyone's clamoring about.  Boot the bomb for life.  Oh, yeah.  And for life in big red letters.  Yeah.  In the Daily News today here in New York City, the NBA's known about Donald Sterling's sickening  racist views for decades.  Don't find him.  Don't suspend him.  Just boot the bomb for life.  Boot the bomb. 
[00:43:00]  So...  Kareem wrote something really good.  Did you read what Kareem wrote?  I did not read that one.  I heard that one.  That was great.  Can we get the Charles Barkley audio?  He was pretty much defending Donald Sterling a bit.  Just because of the whole privacy thing.  It's about privacy.  That's the big story here.  And people are just letting it blow right by because they're concentrating more on what  this idiot said.  Who cares what he fucking said at this point?  It's just some dopey old guy who owns a team.  That's it.  You know how many business owners have this same mindset and thinking if you threw a recorder 
[00:43:30]  in front of everybody, you'd be fucked.  It doesn't seem like any owners are stepping up to say anything about Donald Sterling.  I think it's the, I'm in a glass house.  I'd better shut the fuck up and not toss any rocks.  I would have thought by now you would have seen a lot of NBA owners coming forward.  Oh, no.  They're all shaking in their boots.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  They know the type of parties they have on the off-season.  Oh, my God.  You think they're in a big room going, huh? 
[00:44:00]  How many of them do you own?  Right.  Har-uff, har-uff, har-uff, har-uff, har-uff.  We like to call them end parties.  We go down to Miami Beach after the season.  Oh, God.  Yeah, they're probably shaking.  Have any owners come forward?  No.  Oh, just to say he was terrible.  Like the guy who co-founded Microsoft who owns the trailblazers.  No, I think Will said something.  Maybe Mark Cuban.  Mark Cuban said something. 
[00:44:30]  He likes to say something every once in a while.  Yeah, he said, he goes, people have the right to be stupid in this country.  And, you know, that's that.  Kareem had a great article on time.com.  He was saying, basically, that we're in the finger-wagging Olympics.  But, you know, like the way we're hurting our necks, just shaking our heads with indignation.  But he was a great writer, and he was saying that this guy's been a known racist for years with housing issues.  And he said, nobody did anything then. 
[00:45:00]  It's only, like, now.  I think the point he was making was, like, when a billionaire is caught by a gold digger talking about millionaires.  Like, that's when people take notice.  Nobody cared before.  But it was a really smart article, and he says this guy had his privacy violated.  And he pretty much weighed it fairly evenly.  He is a racist.  He's like, I'm glad to see him getting humiliated because he's a racist.  But he's got the right to private.  You know, it was just a smart article, I thought.  Yeah.  I agree with him.  Yeah.  A lot of sponsors are pulling out. 
[00:45:30]  That's when it starts hurting the business.  And that's when things, unfortunately, have to change.  I say unfortunately because, you know, the sponsors really have control of all these entities in the end.  If anybody was told that, if you were told, hey, we've been recording you.  I've been recording you for a while now in your private conversations that you've had with people at home, in your car, at work, whatever.  And I'm going to release it on the internet.  Would you be like, oh, good, fine.  Right.  Or would you be like, holy fuck, what did I say? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, shit, what is this?  I'm going to get in trouble.  Is that nobody, no one walking around can think that in their private conversations that they're being so moral and ethical and sweet and nice.  It just doesn't fucking happen.  And so far, he hasn't used the N-word in these tapes.  I know.  I'm very surprised.  He is a hundred hours.  Just like we said yesterday, we said it here, that there's a lot more audio.  Yep. 
[00:46:30]  And, you know, she's just going to slowly release it.  Yeah.  I don't think you start with your stairway to heaven either.  No, you think there's a good stairway?  I think she did trampled underfoot a little cashmere, but she's got the stairway to heaven.  Yeah, the big one.  I think she's got the big one.  Oh, you know what happened?  She's smart, too.  She's also a twat.  It needs to be said.  She's awful.  Not many people are talking about her, but she's a twat.  Because she set the guy up.  She did.  She was baiting him, and, you know, he was stupid enough to think that he could say whatever he wants in his own house. 
[00:47:00]  Indeed.  But you just can't do that anymore.  No, apparently you can't do that.  No, you can't.  That's so scary.  But she's a twat.  She's trying to get herself out of some kind of situation, I guess.  Yeah.  Whatever that is.  And she set him up.  And that's what Abdul-Jabbar mentioned, too.  He said that this guy should be out of basketball and that she should be in jail.  You know, it's...  Wow, you said that, huh?  It's illegal recordings, yeah.  But the thing is, part of it, because I kind of hate her, and then it's like, eh, she was dating this guy for a while, and you know he was probably just acting like a racist around her. 
[00:47:30]  And she might have been like, well, fuck this guy.  Like, I'm black and he's just saying this shit to me, so...  That's why, if you're going to spout out racist shit, you've got to make sure the chick is very cool with it right off the bat.  Absolutely.  Right at the get-go.  Right.  Just start dropping N-bombs at high.  You had me at...  That'd be great.  Well, I guess the lawyers for Sterling have reached out to this broad to figure out how to make it stop, because they know she has many, many more hours of conversations. 
[00:48:00]  Would you hear her excuse?  She said, well, he asked me to tape him.  Bullshit.  Of course it's a lie.  Of course.  She said, he wanted me to tape him because he forgets conversations, so as a reference, he wanted me to tape.  Like, she's trying to put in that little legal thing where it wasn't illegal.  You're lying.  Of course she's totally lying.  Total lying.  This Donald Sterling seems pretty sane for 81 years old, by the way.  I think she's lying.  And then she had to wear that welder's mask or whatever the hell that was. 
[00:48:30]  That was ridiculous looking.  I guess she's a daft punk now.  Yeah.  She wants her privacy.  Oh, does she?  Her picture's everywhere.  Sorry.  Right.  Oh, your privacy.  Yeah, look at her.  The NAACP says they will return all of Donald Sterling's donations, but also that there's room for forgiveness.  They say they decided to honor Sterling with another Lifetime Achievement Award because he has contributed to a number of minority charities compared to other L.A. franchises.  His organization gave more money. 
[00:49:00]  They also said he will not have to return the Lifetime Achievement Award he was given in 2009.  Yeah.  So why should they give his money back?  Who cares if he's a fucking racist?  Isn't that more satisfying to take money from a racist?  Right, right.  Wouldn't you think?  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  All the players are taking money from a racist, so.  Oh, yeah.  I'm telling you, man.  Where's that mass protest?  More people are starting to say it.  We said it here.  The Clippers should not show up for their fucking game until something is done.  I guess the coach is not taking the calls right now. 
[00:49:30]  Doc Rivers isn't taking Donald Sterling's calls whatsoever.  He refuses to talk to the guy.  And then what?  There's silent protests going on all over the NBA with all the other teams still in the playoffs.  That's cool.  I'd fucking fire him.  I'd fire the coach.  Like, this guy's in battle right now.  It would look bad, but you know what?  You're not talking to me.  I'm still the owner, motherfucker.  Right.  Fire him.  Start pulling some fucking crazy shit.  Yeah, he's so angry that he's not taking any of Sterling's calls.  He refuses to take them. 
[00:50:00]  I wonder if Donald Sterling's even calling him.  Or if he just said, hey, I'm not taking his calls right now.  He's got to start fighting back.  Lop off a head.  Hold it up to the crowd.  Right.  Here's what you get.  You keep fucking with me.  I own this team.  That was the nicest tape, I think.  That she released a five.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot worse.  You start out all nice, and then you hit hard at the end.  And then you got the Reverend Allen involved.  He's totally outraged this time. 
[00:50:30]  Not just outraged.  He's totally outraged.  That word outrage is outrageous.  It's so infuriating when people are outraged.  And he's flying his ass to L.A. to have a vigil tonight.  A vigil.  Or it might have been last night.  I'm not sure.  Oh, yeah?  It might have been last night.  He can't believe the NBA has not punished Sterling yet.  How about you look into things?  How about the NBA is doing the right thing?  Investigating.  Making sure, A, it's his voice, which obviously it is.  Come on. 
[00:51:00]  And, B, though, you got to make sure the tapes weren't doctored a little bit.  And then step away from the day it's released to make sure that the punishment fits the crime kind of a thing.  Logically.  And not just an emotional knee jerk.  Remember Greek homo guy?  Fucking Greek homos?  I don't know.  If anybody should understand the process going through after wiretap recordings are made, it should be Al Sharpton.  Yeah.  Right.  You should understand perfectly well that it takes a while to go through all the audio, Al. 
[00:51:30]  Speak into the briefcase.  Let's go to Corey in Yonkers.  Corey.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Corey.  I really don't agree, you know, what Donald Sterling was saying.  But you know what?  Anthony, as you were saying, how you should just fire Doc Roos and not take this call.  If Sterling wanted to, I have somebody in his family go up to all these players and say,  if you guys want an out, go ahead, I'll release you from your contracts.  Because you know there are plenty of people who just want to play in the pros and don't care who they play for. 
[00:52:00]  And they don't give a shit.  And they, quite frankly, don't give a shit.  The sharks circling in the water now, most of them are just on the bandwagon.  They just jumped on like, oh, well, I need to be outraged.  I see that people are getting pressed for this.  Let me be outraged.  Right.  I don't know.  Like I said, real outrage is over 100 people shot in one major city. 
[00:52:30]  100% of them are African-American.  And not a peep.  That should be conjuring up some outrage.  But, you know, it gets nothing.  All right.  And no one who knows him is sticking up for him.  That's something to tell you, too.  Nobody, like, Kareem knows him, he worked for him.  He's a prick.  No, but I'm saying, like, the guy is a prick because no one's defending him.  Probably.  No one's defending him.  He's probably the biggest fucking asshole out there.  Yeah, probably because of past behavior.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just know a lot more about him than certainly we do. 
[00:53:00]  But, again, I don't know many bosses that aren't fucking assholes in some way, shape, or form.  And a private conversation.  That's the big issue here.  Your fucking privacy.  People are basking in this.  They love it.  They love the news reports on it.  And they love the outrage.  And then they're not looking at the big picture, which is, who the fuck thinks it's okay to throw a recorder in front of somebody while they're spouting off anything privately?  I don't think anyone should be fired for what they say privately. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  But, unfortunately, as they say, the horse is out of the barn now.  Oh, he rocks.  You know, how do you handle this?  Yeah.  You just tell everyone to calm the fuck down and say we can't fire him because this was done, you know, was a private conversation?  Surreptitiously.  A private conversation?  Yes.  How do you do that?  How do you do it?  How do you tell all those sponsors, like, look, we can't fire the guy because, you know, it was a private conversation?  Yeah.  That's the problem here.  We all agree.  Most of us agree you shouldn't be fired for something you're saying. 
[00:54:00]  In private.  But, when it does get out there, then how do you handle it?  You know what Jerry Lewis used to do?  He used to leave his briefcase in a meeting with a recorder in it and then walk out and then come back in and grab the briefcase and go like, oh, I forgot it.  Right.  And then he'd listen to it and see what they were saying about him when he...  One movie.  When he was in...  Seinfeld.  What?  Seinfeld?  I think you've moved on to other references, though.  That's what I heard.  I just heard that about Jerry Lewis.  Are you serious? 
[00:54:30]  No, look at his face.  No, it's...  I watched a little Seinfeld last night.  I never watched Seinfeld, but it happened to be on my new TV.  And it was the one where...  Oh, new TV.  I heard, yeah.  It's the one where they want to go away to Paris or something and there's a postcard.  I caught part of it.  With the little kid?  Yeah, I didn't see the little kid part.  I tuned in late.  That was a friend of mine, Mike Haggerty.  He was in Lucky Louie, the guy who was burning the clothes at the end.  Oh, yes, he was.  That's right.  Yeah.  The executive. 
[00:55:00]  Seinfeld is 60 today.  Is he?  Seinfeld's 60.  He's had a shitty run.  Happy birthday, Jerry.  He hasn't really done anything lately.  No.  Poor guy.  Was that a Seinfeld reference?  I need to know.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Let's say hi to...  He's had his Jerry Lewis cufflinks.  Bob in Pennsylvania.  Bob!  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Bob.  I've got a quick question for you.  How can you be such harbors of privacy and then do what happened with the Anthony Weiner pic? 
[00:55:30]  Awkward.  I don't think that was private.  The picture itself was released by Anthony Weiner to somebody online.  It wasn't taken in a locker room where he was expecting...  Once you put a picture of yourself on the internet, you have no expectation of privacy with that picture anymore.  None.  Look, we're dirtbags, okay?  I'm not trying to...  I just wanted to get your day. 
[00:56:00]  Got it.  Well, that's it.  I hope you and Anthony were not in a relationship with Anthony Weiner.  It was.  That, too.  Kind of, you know, yeah.  I don't think it was.  I don't think it was private.  You've texted...  I've texted a chick to a chick.  That was just him sending a chick to a girl.  Yeah, exactly.  But once you do that, you know damn well there is a great potential for that picture to get the fuck out there.  Sure.  Especially if you're a public figure.  Yeah, I mean, he was poor, terrible.  It was stupid of him to do, but...  That would be like Sterling spouting off into his phone and then texting that message to somebody. 
[00:56:30]  That audio message.  And then the audio message gets out.  He would be an idiot for sending it in the first place.  And that picture was being shown all over town, all willy-nilly and such.  Oh, my God, was it ever.  Everyone saw that picture.  And then we just grabbed at an opportunity.  Right.  And now, uh...  Well, the betrayal was by the girl.  You're talking apples and eggplants here, sir.  The betrayal was by the girl, just like it was with his, you know... 
[00:57:00]  It's not by you guys.  You weren't the ones who were trusted with it by him.  You betrayed Breedbart.  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Tony in Michigan.  Tony.  Hey, yeah.  What up, brothers?  How you doing?  Hey, Tony.  How you booing?  What's up, brother?  Hey, hey.  I'm black, Italian, Irish, man.  I've worked with a lot of freaking idiot, bigot bosses in my time.  But, you know, it has nothing to do with the work.  I'm not making an excuse or nothing, but if you don't want to work for that person, you  go to the next gig, and that's all I'm saying. 
[00:57:30]  I really think the move was for the team to just not play the game.  That would have been an amazing statement.  Yeah.  I really believe that.  And in the end, the Clippers are not going to win the NBA championship.  So, in the end, they lose a series, and they're done for the year, and then everyone just  moves on.  But if they made that statement and didn't show up for that game, oh, my God.  Nah, that'll never happen.  Of course it'll never happen.  Everyone's scared to lose their money.  Hells, yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, you got a job to do, because isn't it bigger than just what he, just because he's,  you know, kind of racist and dumb?  Of course.  You're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When do the Clippers play again?  I think the series is tied at two, right?  Tonight?  Is it tied at two, Travis?  Two?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think.  I just know they play tonight.  It's game five.  Yeah.  And what?  The Warriors coach there encouraging people not to go to the game or something?  I don't know.  I heard that came out.  Yeah.  Anything else, Tony? 
[00:58:30]  No, that's cool.  I'm punching out, brothers.  Have a great show.  Yeah, you too.  Thank you.  Right now.  What again?  Oh, it says here she could also find herself in bigger trouble if she secretly recorded  Sterling, because California requires both sides of a conversation to consent to it  being taped.  Sure.  That's why she had to say that, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a bit of a twat.  Although, how much of a twat is she if she's dating this guy, and he's just, like, if you're  dating a half-black chick, and all you're doing is dropping N-bombs and saying, I don't 
[00:59:00]  want blacks her out, eventually that chick is going to lash, like, you can't expect to  do that and not have some kind of a fucking vengeful...  Some kind of issue.  Yeah.  What do you expect?  She put that in the back of her head and then waited for the relationship to go bad,  whatever weird relationship they had, by the way.  Because it seems like she was allowed to do whatever the hell she wanted.  Hey, you know what?  As long as she showed up on his arm every once in a while.  That fucking money.  She's probably getting anything she wants.  Yeah.  And, you know, she puts up with all that shit until it starts going away, and then she, 
[00:59:30]  you know, comes out with these tapes.  Let's say hi to Birdman on Long Island.  Birdman.  What's happening?  Hey, listen, ain't this fucking cunt a half a mule on anyway?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  She's Mexican and black.  This short brings out the best in people, doesn't it?  It really does.  You know me, but still, it doesn't make a difference.  But why would he be with her if he's a racist?  I don't understand it.  You know what I mean? 
[01:00:00]  It taps into that fucking slave master mentality.  That's why people hate this guy, because it's like that plantation mentality, like, you  know, treat blacks a certain way, but still want to fuck one.  You know, that's...  People loved watching 12 Years a Slave and Django and stuff, but when it's real people, it's  like, well, now we don't want to see this.  He didn't beat that cunt, did he?  It's like, oh, boy, Leonardo DiCaprio was great.  I loved his character.  He was so, oh, hateable and everything.  Oh, we don't want to see that.  Yeah, and how apologetic was DiCaprio. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, this is the worst character on her part.  We got it.  We know it's a role.  You don't have to sell how bad he is.  Right.  We understand.  He's terrible.  Oh, white people are so petrified.  All right, Birdman.  Thank you.  White people.  Let's go back to Philly.  A lot of fucking listeners in Philly, man.  Yes.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  So the guy doesn't like black people.  Big fucking deal.  She recorded it.  Is it that big of a deal? 
[01:01:00]  Well, it's a big deal now that it got out.  And the big deal people are saying is that he's an owner of a company that employs a lot  of black people, and perhaps some of those people were discriminated against, didn't get  the job that they were qualified for because they were black.  Maybe the pay is different in the front office because they're black.  Like, who knows what type of discrimination he's practicing because of his ideology. 
[01:01:30]  They're weighing hundreds of millions of dollars, everything else you know, that's all great  and well.  I mean, if they don't show up to a game, Donald Sillow is just going to sit there and go,  see, well, I told you, they're the laziest people on the face of the earth.  They're the blacks.  They got to show up for the game.  They got to, yeah.  They have to show up for the game.  But I get why people are mad, too.  It wasn't like he just made one-line remark, like, ah, you know, he's saying don't bring  blacks to the, I get why black patrons don't want to go, like, fuck you, I've been supporting  your dog shit team.  It's not like they're the Lakers or the Celtics. 
[01:02:00]  They're a shitty team for decades.  I don't know if they have to show up for the game.  I wonder if some of these players will tap out.  Because this is way bigger than a stupid game to these guys at this point.  Yeah.  It's everything.  It's everything for them.  So now they're going to go and just play the game itself?  That seems really strange to me.  Unless the NBA comes out and does something dramatic today, then, of course, they'll have  no problem playing the game.  But if the NBA doesn't do something dramatic today, I wouldn't be surprised if a couple  guys just say, I ain't playing tonight. 
[01:02:30]  Fuck this.  What's their reason?  Even though I get emotionally, what can they say?  Because my boss said lousy things to his girlfriend?  Because they truly think he's a racist, and I think it taps into that whole slave slash  master mentality.  That's what I think.  Do you hear what Spike Lee said?  Oh, boy.  Oh, you got Spike's clip?  Oh, we got the Spike.  Spike's an idiot.  Well, Spike likes to take it to the F.  Yes.  Ah. 
[01:03:00]  Very good.  Yeah.  Spike Lee.  This guy, Donald Sterling, should not own a team.  He's got to go.  Because he's tainting all the other Twainline partners.  He's tainting the league, and he's tainting in America.  And when you hear something like that, that is the mentality of a slave master.  He sees his players as slaves.  He feeds them.  He's worse than slaves.  Those are some well-paid fucking slaves. 
[01:03:30]  I want to say, I want to comment what Magic said.  Say, well, people say, not just Magic, people say, well, doesn't he know that all his players  are black?  Yeah, he knows that.  Magic knew that, too.  We're out there in the cotton fields and whatnot.  We?  When would spike out in the cotton fields, this little shit?  And I would like to see, even though the league is 75% African-American, I think this  is, outside from Dirk and Whiskey, I really never heard from the white players.  I think this should be an issue that white players speak out about, not just African-American 
[01:04:00]  players.  Everybody.  Everybody.  If you are someone who believes in humanity.  Like blacks speak out about black and white crime.  Shut up, hypocrite.  Fuck you.  This is a front to everybody.  We all should be outraged as Americans.  We should all be outraged.  I don't think he's being unreasonable there.  He's being unreasonable there.  Because every black guy, like Spike Lee, comes out and says, everyone, the white players, 
[01:04:30]  everyone needs to be outraged when black people get their feelings hurt.  Yet when the multitude of black and white crime happens, you don't hear a peep from these  motherfuckers.  Like Reverend Al, and fucking Jesse, and Spike.  I don't see Spike getting all fucking upset about the poor old dude that got the shit  beat out of him for hitting that kid accidentally, and then gets out to help the kid, and a gang 
[01:05:00]  jumps him and fucking beats him into a coma.  Where was Spike?  Shouldn't everyone be outraged?  There's two fucking racists in the news in the past couple of weeks.  Two white old dudes saying racist shit in the past two weeks.  And all of a sudden there's this systemic fucking racism in the U.S. that needs attention  thrown on it.  But you mentioned poor behavior in the black community, and it's a few bad apples.  Let's not concentrate on it or give it the time of day.  It's horse shit! 
[01:05:30]  God!  Ah!  Wish I knew German when I spoke like that.  Sounds a lot better.  But I, even though I think, you know, you raised a fucking really good point.  I know.  In this point, what Spike is saying I don't think is crazy.  Despite all the other bullshit, like, that's not an unreasonable thing to go, like, everybody  should be outraged that there are...  Well, I want to see some other outrage then.  I want to see some other fucking real, viable outrage about the mass murders going on in 
[01:06:00]  the inner cities.  And not blame it on the guns.  Blame it on the culture and the people that are doing it.  There's just zero accountability.  We all look at it like it's a bigger picture thing, though.  Bigger!  But, you know, when something like that happened, we all look at, like, the bigger...  This just taps into something, I think.  This guy just fucking taps into a certain mentality.  Just like when you hear...  Like when I hear, you know, old white guy gets beat up by five...  No, it taps into a fucking...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess so.  Porn I like.  But we're talking about it, and we're condemning what the guy said. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  That's something that white people are doing.  When he says, you know, everyone should be outraged, there aren't many white people  defending what this guy said.  You could defend his right to privacy.  You could defend his right to own a team and be an asshole.  But no one's coming out and defending what he said.  Everybody is critical of what he said.  You don't see that, on the other hand.  When there's a white victim, and not just of butt hurt because of words, we're talking  fucking major assaults that are going on. 
[01:07:00]  And just nothing.  So fuck you, Spike Lee.  Until we see it on the other half, you could go fuck yourself.  Let's say hi to Don in Florida.  Don.  Is Don on the phone?  Good morning, everybody.  How y'all doing?  All right.  I got a thing.  I was hearing Magic Johnson on CNN, I think it was.  There's nothing that they could do to this man.  But only in the NFL, they have a bargaining agreement that they can suspend the owner or 
[01:07:30]  like ousting.  But in the NBA, there is nothing they can do.  He said the only thing that they can do is that the public can only not go to the games,  get in his pocket.  But the NBA, there's nothing they can do to this man.  That man has a right to say what he wants to say.  I think that's the way it should be.  The public doesn't want to go.  I get why they don't want to go.  I think that's how it should be.  Free market.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  The public says we don't believe in this guy said fucking we won't go to the game.  It's his business.  He owns this team.  The public will be going to this game.  And it's like they were saying.  I'm sorry.  It was like they were saying.  He paid $15 million for that team years ago.  That team's worth over $600 million.  How are you going to hurt this man?  I mean, he can say whatever he wants to say.  Magic said, he said, man, there's nothing.  And even LZ Anderson said that, hey, this stuff will fade out.  It will fade away because there's nothing can be done. 
[01:08:30]  But, you know, and these blacks, like Al Sharpton, he'd come down to Florida whenever Trayvon Martin got shot stuff.  And they'd come into the governor's office and set in and set in trying to get the gun laws changed.  These people, that's all they do.  And then whenever they don't get their way, they move on.  That's true, yeah.  They don't have much longevity or real drive, these organizations like the National Action Network, Reverend Al's. 
[01:09:00]  He'll go somewhere and protest.  But if he doesn't get immediate results and the cameras start peeling off and not covering them as much,  he packs up his dumb little bags and fucking leaves.  He's out of there.  Yep.  Right, exactly.  And that's why it happened down there.  But I got one more point, and I'll let y'all go.  I love y'all's show.  But, man, I'm going to tell you, the racists, they always come to the whites.  I'm from the South, and I was raised in the South, and we have our beliefs. 
[01:09:30]  But, you know, they're more racist than anybody.  They have had this trope in their head of that they always get the bottom end of the stick.  They get this.  Bottom of the barrel or shitty end of the stick.  They get more crap than what I could get if I was crippled.  They get food stamps.  They have six, seven kids.  The accent really brings it home, doesn't it?  They get all the friggin' tax breaks.  They make all the money.  The accent really brings it home.  You're right, sir.  Blacks have been spoiled in America. 
[01:10:00]  Good point.  That's an excellent point.  The nerve of them.  All they want to do is holler racism.  You know what?  You go to the store.  They hate you more than you hate them.  That's a relief.  They just look like, you know, what the hell are you doing here?  Man, you know, it just drives me insane.  But, anyway, y'all have a good day.  We are just never going to figure this out in this country.  All right, thank you, sir.  Leave that, man.  Yes, sir.  And one more point.  Oh, wow.  NBA is 75% black. 
[01:10:30]  Get over it.  Get over it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Hey, perfect setup, boys.  That last caller, full of shit.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Judge Andrew Napolitano, that guy on Fox News, he was on about 15 minutes ago.  Oh, good.  He actually read the contract that the owner signed.  They've got this morality clause in there that says, even in your private life, you have  to represent the best interest of the NBA.  Wow. 
[01:11:00]  So, he's fucked.  He's gone, which is good.  Although, I do think the free markets should have their ability to do the work.  I think the NBA right now is just looking for something else besides these tapes because  they were done illegally.  So, they're just looking for some other shit to get rid of him.  He's got a funk of a civil suit there also if they do ruin his livelihood.  This guy's not going to allow the NBA to ruin his livelihood.  Or his character if he truly believes that he got fucked.  Yes.  Or lack thereof. 
[01:11:30]  I don't like the police.  I mean, he's an idiot.  This guy's a racist.  He deserves to be gone.  I would rather the free markets just take their toll.  Players don't show up.  Advertisers pull out.  Nobody's up to the game.  I mean, wouldn't that be the best thing to do?  Because then the price of the team goes from like $500 million to $10 million instead  of forcing him to sell at market value?  Yeah, the market value.  He's going to get a lot of money.  Can't the venues just ban him from attending any games?  Huh?  Pretty much exile him?  What if he brings a black person? 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  I think he does that.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's see if we covered all this.  This guy wants everyone to know that he's not white.  He's a Jew.  Oh, there you go.  Go ahead, Ron.  I keep hanging up on you, but you won't go away like a fucking cockroach.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  Yeah, I'm a cockroach.  Okay.  Yeah.  How many whites are going to be attacked by the mugs from something a Jew said?  Just like the white Hispanic Zimmerman. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, hey.  This guy's a Jew.  Oh.  He's not white.  Go to Stormfront.org and read the thread about it.  It's out there.  Stormfront.  Stormfront.  Wait, what?  How many whites are going to be attacked?  That's some hardcore shit right there, Stormfront.  No, it's a white nationalist fight.  We know what it is.  You don't have to tell me.  Exactly.  The biggest donor is here on the...  It's my homepage when I open my browser.  Hey, Dan, shut the fuck up.  Oh, sorry, sir. 
[01:13:00]  I apologize.  I didn't mean to interfere with your getting the white people ready.  Go right ahead, sir.  I apologize.  I want your audience to know he's a Jew.  He's not a white guy.  Oh, thank you.  Absolutely.  Jimmy's probably a Jew lover, right?  Yeah.  Damn you.  I consort with the Jews.  I'm a disgrace on the race.  I know you can't upset your Jew owners as serious.  Oh, man.  Yes.  Could you sew this on the breast pocket of your outfit, Jimmy?  It's a little yellow star. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, what's your name on Stormfront?  Nazi 420 Blondie.  I'm sure you're this hardcore to Jews in person all day, right?  Right.  I'm sure you are.  All right.  Whatever.  He's a Jew.  He's not white.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  We're not nice to our Jew owners.  I'm sure you walk around with this attitude all the time and say what you're saying to us,  to people in real life.  Hey, my founding forefathers founded this country for white people.  You didn't acknowledge that. 
[01:14:00]  You didn't acknowledge that.  And I'm glad your forefathers did find this country.  Thank you.  And for myself and for my prosperity.  Not for the Jews, not for the blacks, not for the Hispanics.  You almost said the Indians, too, but you realize, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're kind of here.  Easily bowled over.  Yeah.  Whole different stories.  Yeah?  Hi, hey.  Remember.  Anything else, Heinrich?  Yeah, exactly.  Should we tell our Jew bosses something about this Jew?  Because they're not white men like us. 
[01:14:30]  No, no.  The Jews are not white.  I understand.  I know.  You're a medic.  And I appreciate you walking around all day in your real voice, being this guy, not  just on the phone or on Stormfront.  I'm glad you walked.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You don't think he just walks into places and starts spouting off the stuff?  No, he doesn't.  No, he does not.  Yeah.  No.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Goodbye.  Take care.  All right.  He cares.  Let me go to Tammy in Virginia.  Tammy.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I agree with Anthony most of the time. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Jen and Opie, they're always so in the middle that it pisses me off all the time.  No, you're right.  I apologize.  You know what?  It's a fault of mine.  Like, I'll look at an issue and I try to, like, weigh both sides.  I'm like, what a dick I am.  I should just immediately jump to one side.  Just go to one side.  Thank you, miss.  Come on, Jimmy.  You're right.  You see your comedy shows when you come to the funny bus. 
[01:15:30]  When you do your sketches.  All right, Tammy.  When you do your skits.  What do you agree with Anthony about?  Well, I agree that, you know what?  It pisses me off that I work 10 hours a day and I, you know, go to the grocery store and  I get in front of the grocery store and people are in front of me and, you know, they got  carts full of food and they're paying with fucking food stamps.  There you go.  And here I am working all day long.  All right.  You know, and taking care of my family.  I'm the voice of the people.  Yeah.  The voice of the common man.  I'm making a difference. 
[01:16:00]  You know what?  It is a difference.  I mean, it's a different thing.  If a white person says something out of mind, you know, all these black people come to their  defense, you know, and if a black person says anything, you can't say jack crap.  So I just want to say Anthony.  Yes, ma'am.  Thank you so much.  You are so welcome.  Every day.  I agree with you.  I'm not a racist.  I love it. 
[01:16:30]  I am the voice of the new America.  You're not a racist.  I love it.  Take that with you.  Heil me.  Heil me.  Heil me.  It would be way braver to say that you are a racist.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Of course you're a racist.  I am not a racist.  Of course you are.  She's not a racist.  She's reacting to what she sees and lives through every day.  That's not racist.  It's a realist. 
[01:17:00]  That's exactly right.  Going with the lady die logic.  She's not a racist.  You're not a racist unless you're using the N word.  I don't ever use that.  Oh.  Bullshit.  Got to fit it into your vocabulary.  If my son uses it, I go off on him.  Because my son, who's 25, will use it.  And when he does, I just fly off my hand.  I'm like, you can't say that.  You know, we can have our opinions, but we don't say that word.  So I think I just get so bad that they get so much, you know, and the white people always, 
[01:17:30]  we're always the villains.  Sorry.  You know, that's it.  So you guys have a great day.  All right, Tammy.  Thank you.  Tammy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What guy on the phone is an idiot.  We're trying to go to break here, Josh.  Go ahead, Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, the guy a couple calls ago, who also is probably not a racist, the NBA actually 
[01:18:00]  does have a couple legal options, whether Nate Silver or the owners.  The owners can vote to kick the guy out, and Nate Silver can say if he's hurting the NBA  product, which clearly right now he is, they can get him out of there.  And with regards to how much the team is worth, it's worth that because of the NBA revenue  sharing, of which this guy has done nothing over 30 years to enhance, so his team has 
[01:18:30]  lost 50 games a season, but the team value goes up because the NBA shares all that TV  money.  If you can make somebody have to sell their business for something that was said in  private, that's an astounding leap to make, and it's an invasion of your rights, I think.  I agree with you, man.  I think that's insane.  I hope Tammy heard that.  I agree with you.  If you have a business, you have a fucking business, and you're the owner of it, and 
[01:19:00]  someone fucking tapes you without your knowledge, puts out what you said, and you lose your...  And then all of a sudden they go, oh, you know that business you built, you can't have  it anymore.  Be like, what the fuck are you talking about?  I completely agree with you.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, sir.  I completely agree with you, but what do we do?  How do we handle this?  Well, you handle it by...  Because now all that is out there.  But it's got to be handled by letting people know, informing people that this is how things 
[01:19:30]  are supposed to work.  You can't crucify somebody based on their private fucking conversations that were illegally  recorded and put out there.  You just can't do it.  Yeah, we'd love to.  We'd love to take him out and chop his fucking head off.  We'd love to hang him, put him in front of a shooting squad, whatever, a firing squad,  whatever.  We'd love to do that.  We can't.  And you've got to get over the fact that you're not going to get this great revenge or something 
[01:20:00]  that makes you feel good, closure, whatever the fuck you want to call it.  Right.  Guy was fucking fucked here.  He's an asshole.  Don't get me wrong.  Believe me.  I'm not even agreeing with what he's saying.  It's ridiculous.  You own a goddamn basketball team.  You've got a black girlfriend, and you're fucking saying this shit.  It's crazy.  Thank you.  Well, did you want to make a final point?  Sorry.  Yeah, well, I agree with what you're saying.  But what I'm saying, too, is that the other owners have been sort of looking for a way 
[01:20:30]  to get rid of this guy.  That's why they work on building their teams and their business.  His teams, for the last 20 years until recently, he doesn't do anything.  He sits back.  Nobody could probably show up at those games, and his team's going to go up $20 million in  value while they bust their hat.  So this could be the opportunity for them to fuck him, is all I'm saying.  I understand your point, but it just so happens that the Clippers are now good, which is  strange.  It's true.  Which is strange, because it seems like he really didn't do much to really push the team 
[01:21:00]  forward.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  All right.  Do we have the Charles Barkley audio?  Is it short, long?  Yes, it's short.  All right.  This is what Charles Barkley had to say.  Read the story over and over, and you still cannot believe what you're reading.  Well, first of all, you can believe it, because this has happened before.  He settled a lawsuit years ago.  Obviously, he owns a lot of land and things also, and he settled a lawsuit that said he  was discriminating against blacks and Hispanics.  So this is habitual. 
[01:21:30]  This is the first test of Adam Silver.  He's got to suspend him right now.  First of all, they got to prove his voice on the tape.  But this is the first big test from Adam Silver.  You can't have this guy making statements like that.  He has to suspend him and fine him immediately.  He has to be suspended.  And the problem I have with it, if somebody want to be racist, that's all right.  That's their thing.  But when you're in a position of power, and you can take jobs and economic opportunity 
[01:22:00]  from people, that's what crosses the line.  But we cannot have an NBA owner discriminating against a league that we're a black league,  Ernie.  We are a black league.  I don't know the number, but I'd probably say 80% of our players are black.  How do you take this as a player?  Well, that's a different animal.  By the way, didn't Barkley come out and say, I don't want white people telling us how to...  And he was right.  But didn't he come out and say, like, yeah, I say the N-word in my private life, and I 
[01:22:30]  want to talk it to my...  Like, all of a sudden, now your four people's private conversation is being put out there?  And I don't think you can...  It's almost like a thought crime thing.  Like, convicting somebody based on the potential of them doing something bad.  Like, all right, he's in a position of power.  He's shown that he's racist.  But unless there's proof that he has used that power that he has to discriminate against 
[01:23:00]  people, you can't convict him on the fact that he has the ability to do that, and the  power, and even the motive to do it, until you actually do it, you know, it seems a little  silly to be even talking about it.  It's crazy, because this is 99% emotion, and 1% like, let's think this out, fact-based  issue. 
[01:23:30]  Well, we know how that works.  Yeah.  It's always on emotion first.  Dan in Jersey.  The man?  Dan the man.  The actual man.  Different guy.  Oh.  Oh, I thought it was so.  Okay.  Dan.  Hey.  Hey.  Danny.  First of all, I want to say congratulations to Jamie for his new show, and I also want  to, uh, what did you guys feel about Jamie Foxx's comments after he filmed Django on Chains  about how he liked to kill white people?  But no outrage, you know, with that. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, he was joking.  Yeah, I don't know.  There was a joke when he got up in front of people and said, um, black people are the  most entertaining people on the face of the earth, and, um, and, uh, the most talented  people, and that it was fun to kill white people in, uh, Django when he was making Django,  yeah.  But that wasn't his first comment, either.  I do believe Jamie Foxx is a racist.  I don't think he likes white people.  I don't think a lot of black people like white people. 
[01:24:30]  And like I said yesterday, whenever there's some type of, uh, interaction between blacks  and whites that, uh, isn't pleasant, whether it's, uh, something as crazy as an assault  or just a little tiff on the street, it's usually the black person that right away says,  like, hey, you white bitch, or this white motherfucker, you old white motherfucker, you  know, the color always comes out, uh, first on, on that side.  And it's amazing.  All right.  Let's, uh, go to Patrick. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, sorry about that.  Patrick in Indiana.  Patrick.  Good morning, boys.  Patty.  I just pulled some statistics off of the, uh, uh, actually, you can check it out yourself  at statisticsbrain.com.  But the Department of Commerce said that blacks and whites are actually both 39% on welfare.  They both are, uh, whites and blacks.  39% apiece.  Now, the interesting part about this figure, Anthony, is 10% of the 39% for blacks are actually 
[01:25:30]  only half black, half white, but they count them as black.  So you could actually take 10% of the black number and put it onto the white number, meaning  that whites would actually have more, would be more on welfare.  Well, I think you're good.  I think you always err to the side of black when you go half and half, uh, like we have with,  uh, our own president.  He's considered the first black president, you know, but, uh, uh, those numbers also,  um, so, so what, what does that mean? 
[01:26:00]  Well, everybody is constantly saying that there's, you know, there's more of that blacks are on  the take when it's actually, if you go down South, there's actually more white people on  welfare than, than black people.  Not according to Tammy, she only saw black people using the old food stamps.  Tammy only saw the black people doing it.  I don't think I've ever said anything to the fact that there are a lot of poor people in  this country of, uh, of all persuasions that are on the welfare.  Like you said, we need to start taking emotion out of it and actually looking at statistical 
[01:26:30]  facts.  Instead of, uh, going back and forth and then we actually might come to some real solutions.  But how come, uh, people say it's an economic thing, uh, about crime and, uh, if, if the,  the poor are the same numbers, the people that are on, on welfare, um, how come, how come  we don't see these massive, uh, videos, numbers of videos of, uh, white violent crime based 
[01:27:00]  on, uh, the poverty.  Well, I think if you go back to the fifties, when, uh, when they had, uh, projects like  greeny green in Chicago, um, where women were not allowed to have men living with them.  What?  I don't, you, you're completely dancing around my question.  No, we actually engineered a, a society amongst black people where they, they, we, where, 
[01:27:30]  where, where, where, where we brainwash, we brainwash them to not know right from wrong.  Is that it?  To not have any compassion or empathy or, um, uh, a sense of consequence.  Is that what we did?  Well, I think we did.  We started, we started, oh man, no compassion or empathy.  Stupid white people.  God, we suck.  We started that first.  We started that first.  And, and the pendulum's going to swing the other way.  But right now, you know, when the pendulum swings, it swings real far to the other way.  And then it takes a while to go back and forth, back and forth. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, come on.  And as Jimmy so fond of saying, you know, we, we, we screwed these people.  Well, did we screw them up?  Why don't we give the same latitude then to these 80 year old racists and just say, well,  you know, it was back then.  And that's, that's, uh, how they grew up.  And that was acceptable back then.  Why don't we give them the same latitude we give to, uh, black people for having had such  a despicable, uh, upbringing back in the fifties when you don't look at these white racists 
[01:28:30]  and say, that's just who they are.  Throw them, throw them a bone.  Well, we give a lot of latitude to racists.  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  Well, what about five and one?  I'm not even saying we should.  I'm not saying we should give latitude to racists.  I'm just saying, uh, it's, it's again, another one-sided hypocrisy that goes on in this country.  The coddling that goes on.  You know, when you live in a place like New York, where you have very definitive neighborhoods,  where blacks and whites are pretty much segregated, a long, hold on, a long, uh, a long income 
[01:29:00]  class.  Now, as you get into higher incomes, you have more integration, but it's really in this  country, we need to start getting away from race and start looking at, at people's incomes  because again, again, I bring up the economic question.  How come, what you said when you first called, the same percentage are, um, uh, considered,  uh, impoverished in this country. 
[01:29:30]  Why don't we see, why don't we see, why don't we see the, the thousands of videos of white  violent crime, uh, in this country like that based on, on poverty?  Well, I think if you go down, we see the, we see gangs of whites running around stomping  people.  Is that what we see?  We see white people, uh, beating each other, holding children in Chuck E. Cheese.  What, what, what, what, what happens?  Where, where are those videos? 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  Everyone's got a phone these days.  We're seeing the world in a whole new way.  We, we have an eye on every aspect of the fucking world, uh, to, to record and document  and see things that normally were, were hidden from us.  We see that now.  Where are the hundreds of white teens running into stores and, and running rampant and beating  people?  What?  Yes.  It's on the, it's on the website, uh, world star rock and roll.  Is it world star rock and roll?  Yeah.  You just don't go there.  See world star, world star, world star rock and roll. 
[01:30:30]  It's, uh, don't blame it on just poverty.  There's a cultural issue here that is not being addressed.  When it gets addressed, the person that addresses it is called a racist.  So therein, the problem will never get solved.  Why haven't you ever said that before?  I've said it so many times.  Uh, thank you, Patrick.  However, yes, Jimmy, I do think one, you're right about, you don't see these videos of  white people.  Yeah.  I think white people have also, we're part of the, uh, the power structure in the country.  Oh, but we are, it's, it's a reality. 
[01:31:00]  Not anymore.  No, I don't think we are anymore.  We still, believe me, the way that white words are held to higher accountability than  the actions of any other group, white people.  But like I said, if you get a black gentleman that is well-educated, well-spoken and well-dressed,  he will kick the shit out of any white guy that's trying to get a job in this country.  But the videos you're looking for, like a white gang, you don't really see them, but where's  the videos of, of blacks in a, in a power structure mistreating, uh, whites legally? 
[01:31:30]  Like, you know, you don't see those videos either.  You don't see videos of a lot of black cops beating white burps.  We're seeing a virtual lynching right now on television, and that's the black power structure.  You mean violence, though?  I mean, I mean physical violence.  Oh, yeah, physical violence.  Where is it?  But, but there's always this preaching that goes on that white people are racist and, and  advocate violence against black people.  There's still, you know, there's, uh, anytime there's a shooting, a white on black shooting,  which is so rare, uh, it's, it's looked at like it's happening all the time, the outrage 
[01:32:00]  again, and yet, uh, black on white crime, you, you don't even hear about it on the news.  It's crazy.  That's the news.  I mean, they're shit.  They're, they're terrible.  Well, we don't hear about it on the news because no one is outraged about it.  No one brings it up.  But that's, you're almost making my point.  That's because when you're the ruling group, you're, you hold your own people in your own  group's behavior to a higher standard than people you see below you.  The ruling group that has to walk on eggshells around conversations on choosing to walk on 
[01:32:30]  eggshells around other people from that group.  Oh, that's what it is.  God, it's a bunch of white people throwing each other under the bus.  That's what fucking racial discussions are.  But it comes from somewhere.  Yeah.  And it comes from the potential of, of, of black groups getting outraged and like Reverend  Al parking his fucking truck in front of your business and, and being an asshole.  But that's all right.  That's all they can do.  That's all Al Sharpton can do is park there and be an asshole.  People have enough fear of that, that they, uh, they throw each other under the bus. 
[01:33:00]  They don't want the business to suffer.  They don't want to lose money.  I mean, okay.  But that's not being, you know, like when, when we got in trouble, it's fucking just a  bunch of cowardly fucking white businessmen and, and white.  And what did, uh, Bernard said that when I just got in trouble, these white guys are all  crawling under their desks and hiding.  And Sharpton showed up.  And that's not a sharp than being powerful.  That's them being fucking, uh, uh, afraid and not just standing up and we're off track  from what we were talking about.  The bottom line here in my, uh, I, uh, in my mind is that the, the, the violent, the 
[01:33:30]  disproportionate amount of violent crime, uh, in, in the black community has to be looked  at.  And, and there's no excuse for it.  I don't think you can take anything and excuse the fact that there is a, a, a lack of right  from wrong.  You don't know you're doing wrong because something happened years ago and, and people were raised  on and under shitty circumstances in this country and not even the people committing 
[01:34:00]  the crimes.  Cause usually it's, it's very young, uh, people.  Where does that come from?  Where does that pension for violence and fucking, uh, a lack of compassion come from?  Again, we've displayed that for many, America displayed that for a long time.  I mean, and I hate to say it have no fucking clue about slavery or oppression or Jim Crow  laws.  We're still paying for what they did and I don't like it.  It's a reality.  If they had just done the right thing, we would have been 50 years down the line already, 
[01:34:30]  but we're not because people didn't do the right thing.  So now we're having this discussion instead of them having it on fucking terrestrial  radio 50 years ago.  Cause there was no satellite.  Now we have to have it.  It's, it's annoying because people before us did the wrong thing.  And that's why we're dealing with this shit.  And we're looking back.  Oh, that was so long ago.  Well, if they had done what they were supposed to do back then, we wouldn't have to have  this discussion.  We'd be having this on a fucking one fifth of the scale.  It would be, it would be different.  It's frustrating.  It's annoying because we're not the people who did it. 
[01:35:00]  You look at, uh, you look at a country like, uh, like Germany or Japan during the war,  they got the shit blown out of them.  Two atomic bombs on Japan for the love of Christ.  And, uh, you know, they rebounded pretty nicely after the entire world wanted to see them  dead.  That's a little oppressive, I'd say.  And, uh, now powerhouses of, uh, economy.  Yeah.  But they're military shit.  Huh?  Well, whatever.  They're military.  I'm just saying. 
[01:35:30]  They're fighting themselves.  If you and I went over there with hammers, we'd take it over.  There's a resilience there is what I'm saying.  There's, there's, uh, an ability to, uh, assimilate, re-assimilate yourself with, with  the civilized society, uh, after your, your, your whole country was completely fucking  wiped out.  Yeah, but they were also really aggressive in the war.  They, they weren't, they weren't like, they weren't innocent.  I mean, they weren't, they, you know, come on, Japan, let's be  They, they piped up and did some fucking very naughty things. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, I, I understand that.  I'm just saying that the end of the war, their, both their countries were decimated.  Their people were conquered.  And, um, in a few short years, you know, 75 or so, even less than that, when they first  started really picking up steam as far as, uh, being economic powerhouses go, they were  able to deal with it.  I don't understand how you can look at something from a couple of hundred years ago or a hundred  years ago or 150 years ago and, and, and still use that as some fucking excuse. 
[01:36:30]  Well, if you're saying you like the white people's violence, like where's white, but look, look  at, I mean, look at World War II is, it's in, look what, uh, happened.  I mean, those were not blacks doing that.  I'm not saying that they haven't done that.  I wasn't saying that.  I'm just saying if you just look at basic human nature and, and, and look at what they  went through in the war because of their own fucking accord, you know, whatever, whatever 
[01:37:00]  they did, you know, the Nazis and the fucking Japanese, they, they, they deserve what they  got, but as a people, they were able to use the resources that they had and, you know,  get, get over the fact that, uh, half the, uh, most of the world wanted them wiped out.  That is true.  But the ability of, you say the ability of to not know right from wrong.  Yeah.  I mean, that was a pretty mass scale to know right from wrong and totally disregard it  on a way different level than just black gangs acting shitty or fucking murderous. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, that was, you know, fucking marching people into a fucking chamber.  God, take a shower.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a men, but that's a white mentality.  That's that.  Those were white people doing that.  And that was a mentality of not going right from wrong and totally disregarding it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's what those videos are.  And look what they got for it.  I'm sure they did get their whole fucking country wiped out with that.  Let's take a break.  We got Lewis black coming by today.  Our old friend. 
[01:38:00]  I haven't seen Lewis in a long time.  He hasn't been around.  It's gotta be a couple of years by now.  Are you insane?  What are you going to talk about this?  What are you doing?  Shaq's in trouble.  We'll talk about that now.  Did he float past someone's window and look in?  He's, uh, he's, uh, in trouble for something.  Oh, Shaq.  Uh, maybe a bit on the stupid side on Shaq's part.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  I can't wait to hear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  We'll, uh, take a break here.  Relax.

I have something important to ask you.  What are you getting your mother for Mother's Day?  How about your wife?  What's the best gift you've ever given your mom for Mother's Day?

[01:46:30]  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that, 99 maybe.  And he goes, um...  Dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  I'm going to fucking hang out and I'm going to meet up with some friends.  This is going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it and some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books  and notebooks and...  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool will this be?  Guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books and...  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass for the minute I get it. 
[01:47:00]  For the minute I get it, he's like, dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  You really fucked ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with his fucking knapsack.  Like, so I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up and the bags 
[01:47:30]  go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging fucked in the upside, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting on my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide. 
[01:48:00]  You know, as we move into the future, personal hygiene is becoming more and more important  to our daily lives.  Why, look, there is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton.  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen?  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this, and I arch my asshole out, and I fucking open  the cheeks, and I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean. 
[01:48:30]  Even on those extra messy days, if it looks like there's still more work to be done,  then I'll take a wet wipe or whatever, and I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost  up.  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know?  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp.  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no.  I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean. 
[01:49:00]  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I learned.  Oh, I get it.  Thanks, Mr. Norton.  Ha ha.  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today.  I like a nice, clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person.  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back. 
[01:49:30]  I'm serious, XM.  All right.  It's from the Jerky Boys movie.  Yeah.  Just a movie?  No.  Just to mop up.  Just got a tweet in.  Hey, stupid.  He had that girl record his conversations because his memory was failing.  Look it up, hypocrite. 
[01:50:00]  Who believes that?  That's what they're saying.  TMZ said that he knew he was being recorded because if they didn't say that, it's highly illegal.  Yeah.  To take a private audio tape and broadcast it.  Of course.  And put it on your website and put it on the news.  Maybe that's what did happen.  What's the upside to him saying, record my fucking rants?  Who would do that?  I don't believe it.  It didn't sound like he was losing it either. 
[01:50:30]  I don't believe that he knew he was being recorded.  There's no fucking way.  He had way too much to lose.  He's not that stupid.  And if it comes out that is the case, then so be it.  But, you know, I think TMZ had to say that just to kind of try to protect themselves.  Like if they reasonably believe they were putting up a legal recording, it's a lot different  than knowing they were putting up something that was illegal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Only time will tell, I guess.  Sure, that has been said so far, but I don't really.  An Asia song?  I don't believe that.  Huh?  A Supergroup Asia song? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, thank you for that.  Only time will tell or something like that?  Mm-hmm.  Only time will tell.  So.  What do you think?  He knew he was being taped?  I totally, I completely believe he had no idea he was being taped.  Completely, right?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There was some trickery going on.  Yeah.  Trickery.  Although Nixon said some dumb shit when he knew he was being taped.  I guess if you take it taped enough, maybe you just get comfortable.  Maybe you just think nothing's going to come of it. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Not excusing that tramp for releasing it, but Convo wasn't illegal, as he knew he was  being taped per TMZ.  Everyone is going with what TMZ told them.  Oh, God.  Because TMZ has to say something like that.  They don't want to be liable.  That would be a huge lawsuit.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe he did know.  I just don't believe he knew, man.  It's like, oh, here's these tapes.  Oh, yeah, where'd you get them?  They were recorded at my house. 
[01:52:00]  I just thought, oh, did he know he was being recorded?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, he knew.  Okay, thanks.  Right.  Now we can post them.  Well, as we were told, he knew.  Right.  That's sort of how that works.  Of course.  All right.  I mean, it's true.  Mopping up some other shit.  Lady Di, don't worry, we'll make this quick today.  Oh, boy.  She was on the phone yesterday, and we learned more about her that she used to, according 
[01:52:30]  to her, smoked crack.  Crack cocaine.  The old crack.  And she admitted that she hasn't done it in about three years.  She said three years.  We said if she was smoking crack, that means she's still smoking crack.  Yeah.  We completely believe that's what's going on.  And she said, no, I just quit one day.  But she said.  About three years ago.  You're only addicted when you're doing it.  Right.  I never really got help, I don't think.  I think she tried rehab, but she left pretty early or something like that. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  So then she was on the after show.  Uh-huh.  The post show, whatever the fuck it's called.  Post show.  The Sam Roberts extravaganza.  And she said this.  All right.  Some updated info on the crack point.  Okay.  Now, what I'm trying to say is, I haven't done crack in a long time.  Good.  At least six months.  No, not six months.  I haven't done it.  What do you think, Bobo?  I told you over a year ago.  So now we're down to over a year ago. 
[01:53:30]  Over a year ago.  Now we're down to over a year ago.  She told us three years.  Right.  Now we're down to over a year ago.  She doesn't know where one lie ends and the next begins.  So there's an update on that story.  Uh-huh.  That's still developing.  Yeah.  Developing.  Lady Di Crackhead storyline is...  Still developing.  It's infancy.  Right.  Let's say hi to Greg in Texas.  Greg? 
[01:54:00]  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  I just wanted to point out that everybody, including Anthony's, missed what the conversation was about at all.  What was that?  Well, it was about an employer talking to his employee.  He's an 81-year-old sugar daddy, and she's his 37-year-old escort.  And he was simply saying, I pay you.  You live like a queen in L.A.  You know people like Magic Johnson because of me, and I pay you to be a lady on my arm in public. 
[01:54:30]  What you do in private and who you do it with, I don't care.  Just don't embarrass me in public.  Don't embarrass me on public media.  And don't embarrass me in my own house.  That's all he was saying.  She made it about race.  Nah, I think you're half right.  I don't think you're, I think, maybe that's a good point about maybe the sugar daddy thing and maybe don't embarrass me.  But he also made it about race.  You can't blame her for making it about race.  Come on.  Well, yeah, but, yeah, but that's embarrassing him in public.  He's supposed, she's supposed to be his lady in public. 
[01:55:00]  Well, then he should have said any guy, right?  Don't bring any guy to the game.  Not just black guys.  Right.  Maybe that's what embarrasses him.  He's an 81-year-old racist.  Who cares?  The point is, he's paying her God knows how much.  You know, she drives a Mercedes, lives in a penthouse, has the clothes and shoes.  Chicken, champagne, champagne cocktails, higher than Sierra Mountains.  Well, I'll tell you what, once he dumps her, you think she could find, you think she's pretty enough to find another billionaire so she could live like a queen in L.A.? 
[01:55:30]  No, but I also think they were more than, I don't know, how much sugar daddy.  Maybe she was a full-time sugar daddy.  Who knows?  Right.  And it's not crazy.  Well, they obviously had some kind of falling out, and now she's trying to get back at him.  That's pretty obvious.  Well, you know what it was?  The family embraced the lawsuit set by the wife, the estranged wife, I guess.  Yeah.  She wants that, I guess, the car's back and the money or whatever the fuck it is. 
[01:56:00]  All right, Greg, thanks for your phone call there.  Let's say hi to Steve in South Florida.  Steve.  Yeah.  If it was illegal, if they're saying that the tape, you know, it was illegal, but TMC's saying, well, you know, she had permission.  What happened to the dog, the bounty hunter, when I think it was recording with his son?  And his son let that recording go about how he said, I don't want you dating an N girl?  Yeah.  I mean, that was obviously an illegal conversation that was put on the air.  Yeah.  What state, though?  Something ever happened to that. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  I don't know the ins and outs of this, yeah, how that one was released, but it seems like that would have been illegal as well.  You're right.  Certain states, it's different, though, right?  Right.  Was it?  Didn't Doge, the bounty hunter, leave a message on a machine?  Wasn't that a message?  So you know you're being recorded at that point.  Maybe that's the difference?  I think it is.  He did leave a message, but when his son returned the phone call, his son said, hey, I'm going to record this.  Right.  And his son recorded the following conversation. 
[01:57:00]  I honestly can tell you, I don't know.  I don't know.  I really don't know if that was legal or illegal.  I think that the owner of the owners is much more wealthier, and probably they're much more afraid of being sued by somebody who's got power.  So they're saying, hey, we better put power on this one.  Right.  Money equals power equals status in this day and age.  Then you get the woman.  You get the power.  All right.  All we're saying, it's easier to say to everybody that he knew he was being taped so they could post it. 
[01:57:30]  So whether that's true or not, I still don't know.  I feel like that's not true.  That he had no idea he was being taped.  But TMZ, I feel like, had to say that to get that thing out there because they knew they had gold.  They're trying to cover their asses.  Could you please tape me saying, don't take black people to the games?  Like, in his mind, what would be the upside to that?  In his world, he owns a team.  Why would you tape that? 
[01:58:00]  Like Charles Barkley said, in a black league, it's legal to record a conversation if you're a part of it.  No, in certain states.  It goes state to state.  In some states, both parties have to be privy to knowing that they're being recorded.  And Mark Jackson is calling for the fans to boycott Game 5, which is tonight.  Because the Clippers are in the playoffs.  That place will be packed.  It will be absolutely packed.  That place will be packed. 
[01:58:30]  Because you're supporting the players.  Like, the owners, no one cares about any of the owners.  It's always the players you're supporting or the team.  Supporting the team.  Yeah, they don't care about the owner.  I think the NBA commissioner hasn't done anything yet because I think this is a bit complicated.  They're trying to figure it out, man.  Yep.  It's not black and white.  Yeah.  It's a bit shady in some areas.  So they're trying to figure it out.  Now, I don't understand this Shaq thing.  Shaq under fire for mocking disabled fans' selfie. 
[01:59:00]  Whoops.  Now, Shaq is making what we used to call the retard phase.  Oh, no.  Shaq's going.  Like we used to say.  Remember I said that part.  Here's the sound that goes with the face that Shaq is making.  He's making that face.  Shaq likes.  Oh, my God.  We all know by now that Shaq likes to have a little fun.  Yeah.  He's told us on our show that he's a funny guy. 
[01:59:30]  He's a balloon.  And he's also a balloon, yes.  The Shaq balloon is still living.  Of course.  Living on.  And I don't understand this.  Did Shaq see this guy's selfie and then decide I'm going to like mock him?  Oh, my God.  Because look.  It looks like him.  Once again, you got to understand.  You got to understand the culture we're living in right now.  You probably didn't know the guy was.  That's a major red flag.  Wow, Shaq.  What's he doing? 
[02:00:00]  You just can't do that anymore.  I love it.  Oh, Shaq.  That silly face.  What is he doing?  But how does this story go?  I just read the whole article and I don't understand the connection.  You want to watch the news story?  Yeah, that's the guy, right?  Yeah, that's him right there.  He does an interview.  But what's the connection?  Did Shaq truly see this guy's selfie and then just decide I'm going to mock it and do a split screen?  Yeah, I think so.  And put it on my hand.  And he put it on the Instagram?  He's a fan. 
[02:00:30]  The post has since been removed, but of course.  I bet he didn't know the guy was disabled.  How did he not know?  I know.  I mean, he looks very disabled.  No, because the guy's making it.  It could be the guy making that like teeth on the lips face, that tough face.  I'm looking at that.  I'm not 100% sure he's disabled.  I don't know.  Wait, do you think the...  See, I have a good line, but I don't have...  Oh, boy.  Go for it.  I'll put my finger on the dumb button.  No.  And by dumb button, he means my asshole.  Are you just trying to... 
[02:01:00]  Bad name.  Are you trying to say the person that Shaq was mocking with the, as we used to say, the retard face...  Right.  Was that guy actually doing the retard face?  Oh, so you might think he's just making a wacky face, and then Shaq just impersonated the wacky face.  Right.  He thought the guy was being a goose.  Ah, maybe that's it.  Let's see the news story.  Let's see the story and try to fill in the blanks here.  A Madison Heights man getting unwanted attention online from celebrities. 
[02:01:30]  Shaquille O'Neal is known as a jokester, but Jamel Binion wasn't laughing when he saw the former NBA star making fun of his appearance on Instagram.  Fox 2's Randy Wimbley with that story.  With that story.  Hardly any of us think twice when we post a selfie on Facebook, and neither did Jamel Binion.  But once he did, he became the butt of jokes, and because the picture was online, thousands of people were laughing.  We all, to some degree, know what it feels like to be different, but Jamel Binion knows that feeling better than most. 
[02:02:00]  Fuck, look at his head.  All right, Jesus.  Yeah, well, you look at him.  I can't take it.  You look at him in this video, and it's fairly obvious.  He's got, like, that sonar equipment that beluga whales have in their forehead.  He's fucking...  He's mapping his surroundings with his head.  I don't know.  That's a big head.  He's a large-headed man.  I mean, that's pretty obvious.  We're dumb-dums.  But what is Shaq thinking? 
[02:02:30]  What is he thinking?  I don't know.  Holy shit.  It keeps him from sweating, his hair from growing, and his teeth from fully forming.  I've been getting teeth since I was, like, gay tall.  People would laugh at me, stare at me.  But a lifetime of bullying could not prepare Jamel for this.  People was coming to me.  They were telling me, like, yo, you got a picture.  Shaq posted a picture with you. 
[02:03:00]  The caption smiled.  Today, the unflattering pic on the Shaquille O'Neal Instagram account could earn more than...  Shaq.  Hey!  Look who it is!  Look who it is!  Look who it is!  Shake your hands, bud.  How you doing, man?  What's up, Joel?  Long time.  Nice to see you.  How are you?  Joel.  How are you?  I didn't know you were coming by today.  This is a nice little treat.  Little surprise.  This is great, especially when the headphones aren't on.  Oh, shit.  Oh, there you go.  You, uh...  Volume one.  There we go.  Volume one.  We're discussing the Shaq selfie. 
[02:03:30]  He's in a bit of trouble.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  He's mocking this fan.  It turned out to be disabled, and, uh...  You might want to leave, Joel.  You're in Hollywood right now.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that didn't go well for Shaq.  Unfortunate.  Shaq.  But we don't understand why he would do this.  So we're in the middle of the news story, if you don't mind.  Please, yes.  No, keep going.  All right.  Keep going.  We'll see what the guy says.  14,000 likes and more than 400 comments.  Oh, it's kind of hurt.  Oh.  Because I look up to him.  You know, I watched Shaq play basketball his whole season. 
[02:04:00]  So I'm like, why he make fun of me when he's supposed to be this?  My whole mother.  Yes.  Wow.  And on a social media account with former U of M standout, Trey Burke's name on it,  more of the same.  Oh.  He and Shaq weren't the only ones who seemed to score laughs at Jemele's expense.  What?  Atlanta rapper Waka Flock Aflame appears to be.  Waka Flock Aflame?  Waka Flock Aflame?  He's involved with this, too?  He played at my wedding. 
[02:04:30]  Dude.  Wow.  That was what my wife and I danced to her first song.  Waka Flock Aflame.  Waka Flock Aflame.  Come on.  Okay.  He was on the Muppets for a long time.  Oh, boy.  He...  But we don't understand why he did this.  Well, what did Waka Flock Aflame have to do?  I think Waka Flock Aflame might have said something else.  They made fun of his selfie, this guy, I guess.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let's hear.  Going into...  Waka Flocka, he said, this is my number one shooter.  And he had his on Instagram.  And there was, like, probably, like, 10,000 likes and 5,000 comments. 
[02:05:00]  Despite the online abuse, Jemele is looking up.  I got a mind view, like, I can't let it get to me.  Because then I get hurt and depressed.  So I just keep my mind high and positive.  And he wants to turn the mean-spirited gawking into an anti-bullying movement.  I'm starting, like, a whole little thing called Hug Don't Judge.  Think about all the new followers you got.  That don't rhyme?  No.  How dare you?  Hug Don't Mug.  Hug Don't Mug.  You got it.  That stuff's got to rhyme, though.  That's right. 
[02:05:30]  Maybe it's Hug Don't Jugged.  It's fine.  All right.  Go up to him and show him that you differ from everybody else.  So we contacted Shaquille O'Neal via Twitter to find out if he or fans are not the culture.  We also contacted the Utah Jazz, the team Trey Burke plays for, and Waka Flocka Flames record label.  Waka Flocka Flames.  No one?  No one tweeted back at you?  Wow.  Huh?  Very surprising, Randy.  Very sad. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, boy.  So I still don't understand.  Shaq just saw this picture out of nowhere and decided I'm going to mug this?  Yeah.  What was that?  And put it on his Instagram?  He didn't.  I don't know.  I don't understand the connection still.  Shaq's just trolling around for pictures to make fun of?  Or did the guy send him a message saying, I'm a fan?  Yeah.  He might have sent Shaq something saying, hey, I'm a big fan.  It's, you've got, you've got to understand the culture.  When people, like, tweet photos of their junk, or they just, they text junk photos of them, 
[02:06:30]  sorry, yelling at their dick, and it's like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  If you're anonymous, it gets out there.  Right, right.  So if you're famous, you get, oh.  Just don't put your face in it, though.  A lot of hell to pay.  Is he getting a lot of followers through this?  Not really.  No.  That chick looks like me up there.  Go down.  Well, who's that girl that looks like me, Sam?  Up in the bottom right.  That's great.  It's a big A.  That was great.  That was wonderful.  What a delight.  Have you guys ever tweeted anything you regretted?  Well, Anthony Weiner's penis photo. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  Anthony Weiner's penis photo.  No, I don't think.  You regret that?  Not really.  No, no.  It was kind of fun.  That's why with that guy, you go, what screw was loose when you, what the hell?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I don't think I have, really.  Kind of.  What are you?  Kind of good?  I think I'm good out there as far as my internet footprint.  What do you think of the Donald Sterling thing there, Joel?  Did you hear what happened?  No.  Is this a news story?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Crazy, right? 
[02:07:30]  There have always been rumors about him being one of the worst guys out there.  And boy, did it come out.  Yes.  Clearly, she, didn't she say that she was going to get him or something like that?  She said that she was, like, she was out there.  She was out there.  She was out there, obviously.  Job well done.  She was baiting him in those conversations, so.  Yeah.  I don't feel bad for him because, obviously, that's how he actually feels.  Right.  But she, he was totally baited.  Set up.  But the way, I mean, no, it's like, why would you? 
[02:08:00]  Would you, if you didn't know that the past, let's say, month, you were being recorded  in various situations in your house, your car, work, whatever, would you feel okay about  that getting out on the internet?  Just randomly what you say?  Well, there would probably be jokes that people would be like, ooh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  That, you know, when you're, but they would also be, oh, I should turn my phone off.  But I don't, there would be, I can always, I can honestly, there's nothing like that. 
[02:08:30]  Nothing that has incendiary as that.  That's when people were like, oh, well, you know, he was drunk.  And it was like, look, I don't become anti-Semitic when I'm drunk.  Absolutely.  You don't have to be.  I hear you.  That's you.  And you're like, no, no, no.  And I drink menace.  Yeah.  Don't want to drink water.  So, no, I, I, how about you, if you were recording the last month?  Yeah, I would be probably pretty fucked right here.  Really?  Yeah.  If you record him on his drive-in, he'd fucking ruin his career.  Or in between us on air.  When I play Call of Duty at home, I yell out things, and it's, it's very bad. 
[02:09:00]  But I don't, it's just a curse.  It's like a curse.  Are you on, wait, are you playing online?  No, but I'm not on mic.  Oh, okay.  I'm just yelling like I'm pissed, I'm on my couch, and I yell out things, whether they're  racial epithets, or homophobic, or racist slurs, but I yell it out like going, ah, fuck!  You know, I'm not thinking in my head, well, let me blurt this out. 
[02:09:30]  But there are racial slurs ready to go.  They're right under the surface.  At the drop of a hat.  At the drop of a cango.  At the drop of a yarmulker, you know, I, I, I, I sometimes yell out, like, things like  that, you know, and taken out of context, my goodness, there needs to be, yes, I mean,  obviously he was, uh, in, in trap there, but he clearly is, he's got some, I'm not spelling 
[02:10:00]  out a philosophy like he did, like, like, hey, I don't like this, I don't like black  guys coming to the games, I don't, like, it's not that, it's just like a curse.  So what do you think the NBA's going to do?  I think they're going to find a way for him to have to sell the team.  You think?  This is, oh, yeah, they have to.  Now, do you think that seems a bit complicated, though?  It seems complicated, but that's why I don't think they've, uh, said, you know, done anything  yet.  They pushed out Marge's shot, though, like, out of baseball.  Right.  So I think it's going to take a while, but I, someone like that can't be an owner. 
[02:10:30]  She voluntarily left, though.  Like, I don't know.  I think it was tons of pressure.  I'm sure there was tons of pressure is the only reason she left, but I don't think they  actually had a way of getting her out.  Now, I don't know if this guy actually should be thrown off, thrown out.  It's his business.  It's his team.  He owns it.  And because a privately taped conversation gets out, then he loses his business.  So the only way he leaves is if he does it voluntarily, you think?  Probably.  So the pressure's got to be so great. 
[02:11:00]  The pressure, but yeah.  To an 81-year-old man, that that's his livelihood?  I'm telling you, I think this is a little complicated.  He's a billionaire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he might do this.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm keeping the team.  Right.  But the, it will.  And let it just crash and burn.  It's going to affect, you know, people that, who's going to want to play for that team?  He's got to start firing people.  Like, his coach, just go the opposite way.  Just go nuts.  Fuck you.  You're fired.  Fire the coach.  Fire some players.  Get everyone scared.  There's just like three guys playing.  Yes.  There's only a couple games left for them this season, so. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I love that team.  They're great players on that team.  They're in a really hard, I mean, they're in a tough position.  Oh, man.  Imagine how uncomfortable it must be for them.  Right.  But I'll tell you, that fucking, that place will be mopped tonight for the game.  Yeah, they're calling for a boycott, a fan boycott.  That's not happening.  Every scene.  Game five, right?  Yeah, it's game five.  Yeah, that's a good game to boycott.  You follow this dog shit team since 1980, and you're going to boycott game five because 
[02:12:00]  the owner said, fuck it, I don't want blacks at the game two weeks before he drops dead  of his fucking strokes.  Fuck him.  We got a guy in Canada.  He's also a black guy.  He's, all right.  Alex, what's up?  How you doing, fellas?  Hey, Alex.  We got Joel McHale in studio.  He stopped by just to say hi.  We didn't even know he was coming in.  He doesn't know.  How's it going, man?  Good.  You?  How's Canada?  I'm all right.  You know what, man?  Beautiful.  You know what?  Neighbor to the north.  We don't have the same bullshit you guys get to deal with down there. 
[02:12:30]  No, no.  You just have Rob Ford.  You have no, you have no, yeah, you have no weirdos at all.  But he keeps it fun.  Rob keeps it fun, though.  Guys who decapitate other guys on buses and then get out in five years.  Go right ahead, sir.  Remember that dick, buddy?  Listen, man, I was supposed to be on that fucking bus.  Don't even joke, man.  Stop it.  Yeah, stop joking.  Yeah.  Apologize.  You're right.  Good point.  Quit joking.  It's hurting my feelings.  Fuck that shit, man.  I say whatever the fuck you want.  All right.  Whoa.  So what's your point today?  Well, okay.  As a black guy, I tell you right now, I wasn't offended by what he said. 
[02:13:00]  And I'll tell you why.  Because if I asked you guys, would you be offended if I had a private conversation where  I referenced Buck Whitey from time to time?  Would you be offended?  Probably.  But the point being is, if you didn't hear me...  I wouldn't be offended.  I wouldn't even care.  Yeah, but you don't own an NBA team.  And I got things to do.  I can't be bothered with that crap.  But you know what's going on.  And I hate where everyone is all shocked and surprised that an old white guy is saying  racist shit. 
[02:13:30]  And he's had a track record.  And his privacy.  He's had a track record of doing this before.  It would bother me if certain black people said it, though.  Like, remember when Nate ran XM for a little while?  Like, you know, and he was not a big fan of our show.  But there was recordings of him saying that.  Like, you know, fuck white people or whatever it was.  I would have a problem with that.  It would bother me.  We had a problem with him because we had a little breakfast with him.  And he told us right to our face that he agreed with the I'm is firing.  Right.  That bothered us a lot as broadcasters, knowing what you do every day and knowing that sometimes 
[02:14:00]  you're just going for a joke or a line.  And then next thing you know, you're fired for it.  That really bothered us that day.  Yes.  The way I look at it...  I'm sorry to cut you off.  The way I look at it is everybody's trying to be so fucking perfect.  And the more perfect you try to be, the more clean you are, the dirtier you really fucking  are.  And the truth of the matter is...  Language.  Language, sir.  Whatever conversation...  Where does he think he is?  Canada?  Oh, it's crazy.  Speak like that up there.  I'm sorry.  Whatever conversation he had with his girlfriend or whatever, I mean, he must have realized 
[02:14:30]  that she was mulatto of some sort, you know what I mean, before he started dating her.  Jeez.  That's really...  That's a racist term right there?  It is.  He did know she was mixed.  She's black and Mexican.  Mixed race.  But he said something that fucked up to her, too.  He's like, you know, you're supposed to be like a delicate white or Latina girl.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like he's trying to pass her off.  That's what he wanted.  Yeah, but he's trying to pass her off, like not telling his friends she's half black.  Like, this guy is a twat.  You know what it reminded me of?  It reminded me of Eddie Murphy in that comedy skit he did, Delirious, which is, you know, 
[02:15:00]  we should all live by it, you know?  And it's like the whole thing about, oh, a black man have tremendous sex, but I don't  believe it.  You know?  That's the funny thing about...  It totally reminded me of that.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I was a 30-year-old reference.  Yeah, right.  Yes, you really brought it right home.  I thought I was listening to Eddie.  It's like Dick Gregory once said.  All right.  Look what Tip O'Neill said.  He has obscure references.  Thanks, Alex.  Joel is hosting the White House Correspondence Center.  That's huge.  Are you really?  Oh, wow.  It's this Saturday. 
[02:15:30]  Not a big time.  Are you nervous?  Nah, I'm just going to wing it.  Just wing it.  You know, I'm going to do like an improv game.  I'm going to be like, can I get a room in the house that you might have?  Wow.  That's pretty...  That's a big gig.  Have you met Obama?  I've never met him, no.  So this should be your first time as your...  Have you met him?  No.  He's a fan of mine, though.  Is he?  No.  No.  So you've got to stand up there, look at him, and be like, hey.  Yes.  Hey, Obama.  Yeah.  He goes on before, which is bizarre.  That's really something. 
[02:16:00]  And he's very good at jokes.  Really good at doing them.  So on top of being the leader of the free world.  I know.  Obamacare.  I've seen it.  Oh.  You can use that one.  I see what you did.  See?  You can take that one.  No.  Yeah.  It would be proud.  There's no pressure.  I think it'll be fine.  Yeah.  It's going to be...  Yeah, it's an easy gig, I hear.  And most of the hosts are never under the microscope during and after it.  They never really write about what they said.  It'll be all right.  It is, yes.  Are you pawing through the material for anything that might be misconstrued as offensive? 
[02:16:30]  Well, it's that weird thing is that you want to get right up to the line before you go  over and actually say something horrible.  Yeah.  Like, you want to keep the jokes edgy and you want to...  Yeah.  But you can't...  Is it true you're doing an Al Jolson entrance to the whole thing?  That's true.  That would be...  That is true.  That's an attention getter.  But I'm worried that people will not get the reference.  Yeah, that's true.  Like, he just said Eddie Murphy delirious and we were like, what the hell?  We go a little further back with Al Jolson. 
[02:17:00]  Al Jolson was pretty ballsy there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was.  She had a really fucking...  And Seth, I thought, had the best set I've seen with Seth Meyers last year.  It was amazing.  He was three years ago.  Oh, is that...  Wow.  Oh, man.  Are you studying what they did, Joel?  Am I what?  You studying what they did?  Watching the films like the NFL.  Oh, yeah.  I talked to them.  I called them.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Just say, like, tell me what the lay of the land is.  They all said it is the weirdest but most exhilarating kind of thing.  There's a president there.  Yeah.  You sit next to the first lady for dinner and there's no time to prepare. 
[02:17:30]  If you're not prepared by then, you're screwed, but you sit next to her for two hours before  you go on stage.  Man.  It's really strange and wonderful.  Believe me, I'm happy.  It's a bizarre gig to get and wonderful, but it's going to be very good.  And when you first got the call, did you instantly think, I can't do it.  I don't want to do this.  No, I thought...  No, no, no.  It was more like, you're doing this. 
[02:18:00]  Like, you have to.  Yeah.  It was more like, hey, we got...  We found...  There's a kidney for you.  And we're like, great.  Okay.  All right.  Come to the hospital.  But all right.  I'm going to do all that.  Oh, shit.  How long ago did you find out?  It was like two months ago.  Yeah.  Very cool.  They give you time to prepare.  But the two guys that are writing it, or two of them are here, and we've been going through  jokes non-stop.  Yeah.  It's pretty crazy.  Harry Reid jokes.  A lot of Harry Reid.  A lot of Harry Reid.  Chris McConnell. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Really.  Some John Kerry.  Yeah.  There's all...  You got to...  That's the other thing, is that there's so many powerful people in the room, and you have  to be kind of discerning.  You can't hit everyone, or you'll be up there for an hour.  That's true.  Yeah.  You just got to go with the big stars.  Yeah.  Chris Christie will be there, so...  Oh, there you go.  That's helpful.  All right.  This is an easy target.  Yeah.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  Yeah.  So De Niro will be there.  Wow.  That's cool.  Oh!  Yeah, you know, just a regular evening of entertaining De Niro. 
[02:19:00]  Bob De Niro.  Just don't look around the room.  You're going to see some big, famous people.  It's going to freak you out.  It will be a weird...  I've only had one other experience where everyone I looked...  When I looked out in the audience, I was like, oh, I recognize every one of these people.  Yeah.  And the people I don't recognize, I know I should be.  Wow.  Did the Secret Service have to, like, fill you out, talk to you?  Yeah, they do it every day.  Oh, every day.  Just come by and hang out.  I was like, you're going to be sitting with the First Lady. 
[02:19:30]  I would assume, like, they would have to be like, hey, you're not crazy, Jill, right?  Right.  I have been...  I'm sure they've done a background check, and they've done numerous checks, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I have no plans on bringing, you know, nunchucks in or anything, so...  Wait.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you just said something that made me...  Ooh.  Oh, fuck.  Uh-oh.  I can't remember.  You should have recorded it.  I know.  Should we go back?  No.  I just...  There's a question I wanted to ask you.  I just ruined everything. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  This is good.  This is...  I like this.  Let's bring it out.  This is the face I'd be making if I was up there trying to riff and riff on the President.  That is a tough one, looking at the President of the United States and being like, I've got  to be funny, but I've still got to be respectful.  Yeah, you've got to be all that.  And respectful is like the last thing most comics are when they're on stage.  It's a very strange, wonderful gig.  Oh, what was the other gig that you said that you recognized everybody? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, I did this conference in...  I did comedy at this conference in Aspen, and I got up for 10 minutes, and everyone  there was, you know, like...  It was from people like John McCain to Bezos was there, and it was a very bizarre group  of people that were all who could have me killed in seconds.  So it, yeah, it was very weird.  And you read...  Those people have enough money and power to never have to laugh again.  Right.  So I kind of was like, well, I think these jokes are funny, so I'm going to tell them, and 
[02:21:00]  if you don't, I'm like, eh, let's just...  Ah, Jester, make us laugh!  Ha ha!  Kill him!  Bring in the clown!  Yes!  The Jester, please!  Ha ha ha!  Ah, thank you.  We will entertain this.  That's great.  We will let you live.  Dan, and a lot of the press is there, are they reporters?  Oh, everyone's there.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  As far, yeah, because the group of people that are there, not because I'm there, but because  everyone else is there.  So Brian Williams, you got a little Brian Williams?  I assume every channel, every network has a table.  Yes, it's represented.  Wow.  From, like, NPR to, you know, obviously Fox and MSNBC and CNN and all the NBC, ABC, they're  all there.  Well, make fun of Fox, and you'll do well.  Well, you have to make fun of both, because, yeah, you have to go on both sides.  How about those Republicans, right? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, how about those Democrats?  Let me write this down.  That's just good stuff.  Hey, how about those Republicans?  And then, hey, how about those Democrats?  President's here tonight.  Hey, there you go.  Oh, okay.  Just attack the Whigs, because they're safe.  That Whig party.  What happened to them?  Hey, do you have to hand in your set to anyone for them to kind of look it over?  No.  Nice.  They, Seth Meyer, they haven't asked me yet, but Seth Meyer said that C-SPAN asked him to 
[02:22:30]  see his jokes.  Right.  Wow.  And he was like, absolutely not.  C-SPAN.  Because they wanted to be able to cut away to the people he was making fun of.  Oh, I see.  But that's all, you know, pre-planned.  Right.  That you can't, that doesn't, there's no spontaneity.  Yeah.  And the president, when they, when they offered me the gig, they were like, we just want to  make sure he's going to make fun of both sides.  And I was like, well, yeah, of course.  I'm just, yes.  One side.  Just a one-sided beating.  You're just pitching national socialism. 
[02:23:00]  My goal is to be an equal opportunity.  Yes.  Will you meet him before, since you meet the first lady before?  Will you at least get the speaker before?  There's a party beforehand, or like a meet and greet beforehand, but there's a couple hundred  people in there, I was told.  So it's not like you have a one-on-one situation.  Just at least get a picture with Obama.  Wear a tuxedo t-shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what you wear.  That's funny right there.  I might just wear a denim, like all denim.  Just all denim?  Yeah.  That would be cool. 
[02:23:30]  The Texas tuxedo.  Yeah.  That's what I like to call it.  Or like Delirious, the guy I was talking about before.  How about the red leather jumpsuit?  I think it's time for that to come back.  And then toss out some N-bombs, like Eddie did.  And then you can just throw the mic down and fucking walk off.  No?  Seems like a terrible idea.  It seems like.  Now you're re-evaluating your decision to walk into this radio show before you hope the White House  part's worst idea.  Get him out of here.  We're going to ruin your game.  You're giving the worst idea.  I think you're right.  That's a bad idea.  I was just thinking Eddie Murphy's funny. 
[02:24:00]  It's going to be great.  Because Eddie Murphy's very funny.  That could have worked.  You should just do the same thing.  Right.  Oh, my God.  When do you host it?  This week is out of here.  That's cool, man.  Where do you go in DC?  I go today.  I'm taking the train there.  Oh, the old...  Choo-choo.  So you get there at what time?  I'm fascinated by this gig.  Because I always hate when you've got to be waiting to go on.  You want to just go on and get it over with.  What time do you get there?  Oh, I think red carpet stuff starts at 4, 30, or 5.  And I don't think you...  I won't be going on until 10. 
[02:24:30]  It's a lot.  If I'm not prepared by...  Oh, man.  God, you have to sit there, like, freaking out for six hours.  We're getting all fucked up now.  Eating dinner.  Oh, I'm eating dinner and looking around the room and...  Oh, I got to get up there.  Going over your notes under the table.  Yeah.  Because my mom's going to be like,  Hey, Joe, can you just hold it for me?  I'm going over my jokes.  Oh, we are.  What are you going to talk to the First Lady about?  I know you guys like to just go in and out, man.  How awkward.  You've got to sit in the room for four hours. 
[02:25:00]  You've got to be there for a while.  I think that's what makes it very strange.  And you're talking...  It's the president.  He's right there.  Right there.  And in front of you, within feet, there's De Niro and all those folks.  Oh, man.  If you're sitting next to the president,  you're probably not going to care about De Niro and his shittier seat than yours.  I don't think any actor you're going to care about if you're sitting there next to him.  That would be...  We'll get Bob standing in line trying to meet the president.  Yeah, it's very...  Holy shit.  Who knows?  Yeah.  I'll be... 
[02:25:30]  I will be...  I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to it,  but when it's over, I'll be like that.  You're going to be so relieved.  You're going to be like...  Yeah.  Or it'll be like the worst...  Nah, you'll be fine.  If I bomb, I'm going to be like,  well, that was the thing that I did.  Nah, you're going to be good.  We'll see.  What...  How much time is it?  They...  Well, you can do anything you want,  but brevity is the key, I think.  You need to be sure...  It's like you're the last person up.  Oh, wow.  So, yeah, it needs to be over by...  You were the last... 
[02:26:00]  You're keeping everyone there.  So, you know how...  I mean, when...  And, you know, with...  If you go too long, it's worse than anything.  I always want to go on...  I want to go on while the room is still lit  and people are being seated.  I want to just go up and get it fucking over.  Joel's got to go.  You guys are pulling you out of here.  You know, I got another great thing you can do, though.  It's for the entrance.  You jump onto the stage.  And you yell,  Six Semper Tyrannus!  And it'll just... 
[02:26:30]  It's funny.  Let's do that.  Okay.  That's what John Wolfsbooth yelled.  Oh, my God!  I just think it would be funny.  It's like a history thing.  You have...  Joel left...  You have some great ideas.  Really good ideas.  Some of the better ideas I've heard in a while.  No, it's fine.  All right, it's probably not a good idea.  Let's get them out of here.  Again, if you would write these down...  I should jot them down when I come up with these things.  What's your email?  I'll...  I'll get them right to you.  It's...  Just tweet them.  Joel at... 
[02:27:00]  Just tweet them to Joel.  Just tweet them to Joel.  Yeah, tweet them.  Good luck with the gig, man.  That's it.  We've reached out to Shaquille O'Neal over Twitter.  Over Twitter.  Yeah.  We've reached out to him.  Really?  All right.  Thanks, you guys.  Joel McHale, thanks for stopping in, man.  Always fun.  Best of luck.  That's a fantastic gig.  That's great, man.  I'll be back in May if you'll have me.  Of course.  I mean, in June to hawk some movies.  We'll let you know Sunday.  We'll have you back.  I suppose if it was really bad, you'll want to have me on a Monday.

It's been so many years, sir.  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong. 
[02:38:30]  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey, hey.  Hey.  I'm trying to keep it nice.  Yeah.  Of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level.  And I wanted to plug, too.  It's Scottsdale.  Yes.

After 20 years, you would want to break, too.  But the guys are back now.  Enjoy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:40:00]  Hey, look at you, sporty spice.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What happened to my friend Jim?  Jim Norton, you know, he's eating better and going to the gym.  Going to the gym, eating, eating, and he's seeing a stylist.  Yes.  No, it's just really like a $15 shirt.  Oh.  And more hair.  The hair's coming off.  Yeah.  He grew the hair in for something.  We don't know.  It's very sweet. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, thank you.  I think you should keep growing the hair, I'm thinking.  No.  You just should.  No.  You just should.  It's gotten a lot of good feedback, though.  Yeah.  Well, not so much.  Not so much.  Not at all.  We've got to introduce Lewis Black.  It's been...  Oh, yeah.  How long has it been, Lewis?  It's been a while.  A couple of years?  Yeah.  No, we've known you for 16 years?  I think...  Yeah.  Oh, easy.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were right from the beginning when we came to New York, 98 years.  Wow.  I was so pissed they took you off real radio, but I never recovered.  Were we too. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Talk about bullshit on a stick.  Really?  We still haven't recovered.  We're still trying to get back to where we were.  You know what I mean?  Who gets the money for the ads?  They?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  I don't know how this works.  How does that work?  I don't know how this works.  Let me pay you to listen to a radio that I'm paying you fucking for so that you can run  an ad.  Fuck you.  Right.  How about this?  What balls.  You're right.  How about this one?  We don't even know how many people we talk to.  We've been at this almost 10 years on satellite. 
[02:41:30]  They never really tell us.  They never tell us.  We'll ask, and they'll go,  Well, that's within the ballpark.  Couple.  Are you serious?  We have no idea.  There's a whole world of, you know, you're holding the phone.  You know, the information comes back instantaneously.  Instantly.  Right.  They don't want to tell us.  They know.  I assume we're doing well because they keep, you know, giving us contracts, but.  Well, maybe there's some, maybe they just don't, maybe they really can't, maybe they  can't read the numbers. 
[02:42:00]  They just don't know.  Maybe they're number illiterate.  What is that?  I don't know.  I think if they told us how many people were listening, we would run away.  I think as far as individual shows go, there, no show is doing as well as they think they  are.  Yeah.  And I mean every single show on this platform.  That's what I think it's all about.  Because we're used to, you know, millions of listeners when we're syndicated across the  country.  Right.  So, I don't know.  Who knows?  Lewis was telling us about Joel McHale and the White House Correspondents Dinner. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  And you had the same feeling we did.  He's walking.  He's going to get it.  He sounded so chipper.  I wanted to race down the hall and go, it's literally like that moment, you know, God,  it's going to be a great day.  And then you walk in the street and a bus hits you.  Now, you've done one of these kind of things.  I did the Congressional, which is less on the radar.  This thing, plus it's out of fucking control now.  It used to be you'd go do it and they'd show it on C-SPAN and that's nice. 
[02:43:00]  Now it's like they critique you.  Then, well, they let you down and boy, he was funnier and what she was.  And it's like a group of, you know, who the, I would, I'd have no desire to even be in  the room.  Right.  It's a creepy fucking room.  Was the president there when you did it or no?  No.  Here was what was the great part of that was, is that, which was so funny, and was that he 
[02:43:30]  was supposed to be there, but the Pope died.  Oh.  And so he had to leave because I was like going, oh, you know, I'm going to turn to my right  and there'll be the president and then it'd be George Bush will be there.  And then, and so instead it was, it was Cheney, which is worse, you know, but, but, but, you  know, no matter, um, also playing the, uh, the DC audience, you know, in and of itself, 
[02:44:00]  you know, is they're, they're in a fucking bubble.  So you're walking into their goddamn bubble and there is no oxygen for you, you know,  so you go in there and they're looking at you like, uh, uh, oh, that's kind of funny.  We know what funny is.  Oh, it's a giant, it's a giant like corporate Christmas party where everybody knows each  other and they have their inside jokes and references.  It must be difficult.  Well, yeah, it must be difficult to come up with material, uh, so inside for them when 
[02:44:30]  they know everything about everybody in that room.  And plus it's, you know, I mean, I'll tell you the last one who was good at it really in  terms of that kind of, it was Will fucking Rogers.  Oh Jesus.  I mean, seriously, but he's, but he was, if you go back, seriously, you go back and listen  to him, it was bam, bam, bam, bam.  And he could knock both sides and, and, and pull it off because he would, and, and nailed 
[02:45:00]  them.  And in, in a fashion I can't even imagine doing right.  And he actually, when things got so shitty, imagine this, things were so shitty and we  were like on the verge of the complete meltdown and under Hoover, you know, the great depression  is like eight minutes away and they had Will Rogers open for the president on the radio.  Wow.  They had to get Will to open for them because, I mean, because it was kind of like, you know, 
[02:45:30]  and you should, it's on, it's actually, you can go on YouTube and see it.  What year is this?  This is like 1926, 27, 28, that's what it all sounded like.  Ladies and gentlemen, Will Rogers, come on.  It is, it is, that's exactly what it sounds like.  We got to, we got to listen to it for like one minute or something, if we can find it  on YouTube.  Was there an audience, a studio audience, or was it just, no, he was just, I don't know  how he did it either, but I mean, no, there was no audience and he was just talking and  then he brought up the president, you know, and listening, he seems to be, he's just saying 
[02:46:00]  he seems to be a nice fella.  It's not like he's trying, he's trying.  I mean, Rogers came out of Oklahoma.  He was really kind of a piece of, he was really an amazing.  The tutorial that was done by a photographer, James Abbey.  Oh, no, this is, no, that's the history.  Oh, my God.  That'll put you to bed.  All right.  Well, for Sam, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy, your job is on the line now.  Wow.  What is it called?  What would it be called on the line?  Will Rogers introduces, uh, President Hoover. 
[02:46:30]  That's all right.  Just put Hoover.  All right.  Exactly.  Will Rogers Hoover.  See him vacuuming.  And then they'll just him with a vacuum.  He's taking a vacuum.  Thank you.  Oh, it's good to be home.  I just, I just had to do morning, Joe.  You have no idea how happy I am to be here.  All right.  Morning, Joe.  Sorry, up there on the TV.  We'll see ya.  Oh, yeah.  What, they did like five minutes with you over there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they got, they got out, that it was important to get this thing out, that, about. 
[02:47:00]  You're epic special, right?  You're doing an epic special.  Yes.  Yeah, that's, not, see, that's important, but what really is important, I'm doing a benefit  for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation on Monday.  Nice.  You're a charitable man, you are.  Yeah.  It's a big show, so, and I'm trying to sell the last few, I'm really, we got tickets.  Where's it at?  I left the cell.  Rose Hall at, um, at, uh, Lincoln Center, did jazz at Lincoln Center.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Fancy.  Yeah, and, but I mean, I got, and I basically, uh, I've been working with them for 18 years, 
[02:47:30]  and I really said, okay, um, I'm going to do this, which is also the dumbest thing I've  ever done, because I'm, you know, I'm in a sense producing it, which is, and I am really  the last person you're going to ask to come in to produce something, so I'm literally,  I mean, you, as you well know, I'm in total panic most of the time, then I had actual  real pressure.  I'm in panic about nothing, and now I've got, holy fuck, are these fuckers going to show  up?  Where's the film?  So I, I went out, and I got, uh, I got, it's John, John Stewart will be there, and 
[02:48:00]  Whoopi Goldberg will be there, and Joy Behar will be there, and I got footage, though, I  mean, I got funny footage from Meryl Streep, um, uh, uh, uh, Will Ferrell, Stephen, Stephen  is doing something, Colbert, and, uh, Robin Williams, and, uh, and so it's kind of actually  keeping the old teeter-totter tilting toward the left on this one, aren't they?  No, they're not really, it's, uh, I, I can't imagine it's going to be left. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh, I'm serious, none of them, uh, Will Ferrell did something that's extremely funny,  that's nothing to do with anything, and Robin Williams, Robin was, Robin literally was  talking as if he had no idea what I sent to him to do, and the only sad thing, which  will break, I know, break your heart, Jim, because I was so close, and we couldn't get  somebody, I had Christopher Walken, oh, shit, and I couldn't get him, uh, he's, uh, I couldn't  get the film crew to him. 
[02:49:00]  Why?  Because, who's producing the show, Jim?  Oh, no.  Where was he, L.A., and the film crew, what?  No, we couldn't get, you know, my, a crew to shoot him to get stuff back, so.  Yeah, because they're not hireable, you know, oh, boy, Lewis, I can do my impression,  I do an amazing walk-in.  I know you do an amazing walk-in, well, why don't you just fucking do it, and we'll put  it, oh, it's Lewis, oh, black, oh, no, because we had literally, literally, like, they basically, 
[02:49:30]  Chris doesn't have, to his credit, any, um, a cell phone, he doesn't have a computer, he  has a home phone.  Oh, shit, how do you survive?  We had no message machine, and when we finally were able, and, you know, and I was putting  together a whole bunch of stuff, and when we finally tracked him down, we had, like,  a, you know, like, a 24-hour time frame, and we just, it was impossible, there was nobody  there, out there that you could just, plus you need somebody to go out there, you just 
[02:50:00]  can't send a film crew out, and what I really wanted was, I just wanted Chris to do, when  we would sit around, when we were, when I did the, this, this movie with him, he, he  would tell jokes, and that's all I wanted him to do, was tell jokes, they are, it's  just fucking funny, listening to Chris, you ever walk in, tell a joke, because he does  those pauses, you know, and all of that.  But Jimmy so eloquently did, yeah, just doing his impression.  I do a good walk-in, I do a good walk-in, thank you.  Do you do a good walk-in telling a joke? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, if you wanted, I mean, I could give you one.  I don't know, if you would like to, I'm not going to pressure you or anything.  What's a good joke to tell?  I don't tell joke jokes.  No, neither, neither, but to America's least joke joke tellers.  How awful is it when someone says, tell me a joke, I'm like, I don't do this for a  living, I guess.  I never, I never know.  Those stock jokes.  I do, I don't have any.  I told Mickey Rooney was here one time, so I met him and his Cloverfield wife, and I 
[02:51:00]  would jump into the photo and wrecked it, and someone told him I'm a comedian, and  he goes, he goes, give me a joke, and I'm like, I'm like.  The old school guys.  Did you have a joke, though?  No, I told him, look, I'm too dirty, you wouldn't like my jokes, and that's when he  lectured me on being clean.  He berated Jimmy, basically, in the hallway.  Yeah, he's like, you gotta be clean, his dumb little finger, you gotta be clean.  Well, he got his.  He sure did.  But I mean, I realize I don't have that kind of material.  And I just got a, I was, I was, I just got on that fucking Twitter while I look at that 
[02:51:30]  thing.  I just got a thing, I literally got a thing that said, that just said as I'm walking down  the hallway, you know, just because, you know, just because a guy uses dirty words doesn't  make him funny.  First off, using the word dirty word is like, is a tip off to, you know.  You're an asshole.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Doesn't make him funny.  What a tool.  Yeah, I mean, just using clean words doesn't make you funny either. 
[02:52:00]  That's true.  I know.  I know plenty of people are clean that, you know, that aren't funny people.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, but they, but I love that there's that whole group, I mean, that kind of get  done because they are clean.  You know, it's like, oh, but he's a clean comic.  Like, you know, like, we're like, you know, I did, how the fuck clean?  What?  This, we're in the 21st fucking century.  At what point do these words lose any value?  You know, I mean, seriously, these words, you know, fuck means more than peace. 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  Is the word.  Yes.  Peace is like a meaningless piece of shit, but fuck!  Oh, no!  Oh, no, fuck!  It's incredible.  Aren't we getting a little crazy about what words you can say and not say in this country?  And what you can say.  And what you can say, completely taken with no bearing on context whatsoever.  It's really gotten insane. 
[02:53:00]  It's gotten to the point where, we were talking about it once, like that whole, over the years  you heard 1984, 1984, oh, Big Brother's watching, Big Brother's watching.  And now it's just, we realize Big Brother is just all of us.  We're ratting ourselves out.  It's not this big government entity.  Well, is that ever true?  It's people with cell phones.  The second something happens, everyone pulls their phone out and starts recording it, and  then putting it on this massive intelligence spreader that people could just see your mistakes, 
[02:53:30]  your foibles, your, I mean, like.  I don't know if it's an intelligence spreader.  Well, it's, yeah, yeah.  I understand your point, but.  I meant like intelligence, like information.  Stuff like that.  Spreading the info.  Yeah.  So it's like, there was always that fear that the government cameras would be watching  you, and you'd be at work, and they're watching you, and watch what you say, and then it just  turned out, no.  You give enough people phones with cameras on it, and we'll just rat each other out. 
[02:54:00]  Well, it's like, it's kind of funny because it's, you know, you really nailed it, and then  it's like what used to be the Russian mentality.  Right.  It was completely the Russian mentality, you know, that my next-door neighbor has two extra  bagels.  Yes.  Yes.  Maybe.  I heard them talking to someone last night.  They were saying things against the Kremlin, like, you know, that's exactly what it is.  Now, you say something, it's like, oh, look, I got my neighbor dropping the N-bomb. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  So let me show his boss, I'll put it on Twitter, I'll put it on Facebook, and then his life  is destroyed, and it wasn't even on public saying.  And the rules keep changing.  Yes.  It's like certain words, but then it's like, well, no, you have to refer to trans people  as this, and you have to refer to it, and if you're not 100% up on the lingo, even if  your intention isn't to be awful, you still got to come out and go, whoa, hey, guys, sorry.  It's really embarrassing.  The one that shocks me is tranny.  They don't want to be called trannies. 
[02:55:00]  No.  That one amazed me.  I don't know why.  I wouldn't say it.  I'd like that.  Right?  It's fun sounding.  Really?  It's not a violent word.  They don't like the word tranny.  No idea.  They equate it to sexual.  Because I think every group wants their word that they don't want anyone else to say.  They equate it to sexualizing them.  I guess.  So it's like, that's a porn word.  That's like saying slut.  A woman is a slut.  A transgendered person is a tranny.  And it's that E, because people don't like to be gay. 
[02:55:30]  A woman called Jewy.  That's kind of a fun word, though.  That's a good point, Jewy.  A little Jewy.  A little Jewy.  But that's fun, though, that one.  Come on, Lewis.  That's funny.  Jewy is great.  That sounds...  Jewy.  It sounds like something you get at the movie theater when you're going in at the snack bar.  It's really good.  I'll have a box of Jewies. 
[02:56:00]  We're just in this weird place where it's so dangerous to talk.  And everyone talks about, you know, oh, it's 2014.  At least now we can have an open and honest discussion about and then race or homophobia or this or that.  And then the second you open your mouth, you're a racist or homophobic or misogynistic.  It's like, what happened to the open discussion?  Well, as long as you say what I agree with.  Right.  As you throw the line.  With that said, what do you think of Donald Sterling there, Lewis? 
[02:56:30]  Well, it's always good.  You know what I really like?  It's always good.  But I mean, you know, really...  The privacy thing, though, man.  There's no way he knew he was being taped.  Well, you know, I don't even know if he knows he's walking around.  See that guy?  Have you looked at him?  It's kind of like...  Yeah, he was.  He's just a...  It's like what you did with the Will Rogers thing.  It's like looking at a radio built in 1946. 
[02:57:00]  You know what I mean?  And don't be taking your Negroes to my games.  And expecting to hear HD.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  You know, of course he thinks this way.  He's 81 years old.  He's 81 years old.  And he doesn't even know what day it is.  Yeah.  You know?  And being rich at that age, you really don't have to know anything.  And they basically...  You know, it isn't like...  You know, these guys are coming on the TV.  Well, a bunch of them knew...  I mean, you know, Elgin Baylor, who is like, you know, not like a paragon of like the... 
[02:57:30]  You know, we're not talking a Black Panther here.  We're talking Elgin Baylor.  Right.  He kind of went, uh...  I've got to sue you.  Yeah.  I mean, he sues him years ago.  Yeah.  See, nobody watches.  Right, right, right.  That they don't watch.  It's like, as long...  And it's that whole thing.  As long as it's not...  As soon as it got...  The word got out.  Yeah.  Then the NBA goes, oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, well, now we've got to get him.  But what?  You didn't know?  They all knew.  They knew. 
[02:58:00]  You know, they knew.  Everyone knew.  They had a reputation out there.  You know, after three martinis at a party, imagine what came out of your mouth.  That's what we said.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's why we're...  The owners, really...  No one's really coming out, other owners, and saying anything.  Because we think they're all in the same boat.  Yeah, right.  There's probably, you know, oh, did they tape me?  Because I said a few things.  Yeah, I know.  But they're in the middle.  I mean, partly they're...  I mean, he should have been thinking somewhat.  They're in the middle of some sort of suit or something. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Or the wife is...  I mean, it's like...  Plus, it's that whole thing of, you know, what money buys you.  Uh-huh.  You know, money bought him.  It's kind of like, well, we can't really lose...  You know, well, then we're going to lose a team in the market.  Right.  You know, because they don't have a football team.  That's why they can support two basketball teams.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So let's keep that...  That's exactly what it is, because they all know. 
[02:59:00]  They all know.  Yeah, and now I'm...  You know, the other thing, too, you know, and you know from dealing with it now, you know,  over the years, there's fucking...  I want to hear more about the Malaysian air flight.  Well, yeah, yeah, CNN's been...  See, I don't think they've done enough coverage on that, CNN. 
[02:59:30]  Well, I guess...  Well, I guess...  to report  well I guess  at least  troll 
[03:00:00]  they released that today  yeah  just  kept putting him in various situations  I don't think you need a simulator  exactly you fucking park the thing  and hike 
[03:00:30]  and here's you know the other thing I love  considering the amount that I  fly  about how I might get fucked  who's  this is a free 
[03:01:00]  it's a free days that would have been  today after day and I'm getting on a plane  are we gonna fly over a body of water what's gonna happen  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Tune back in in two hours, and we'll show you this listing 10 degrees to port.  And lift this button, and it goes boom.  This is the point where the boat stopped the engine. 
[03:02:00]  The boat simulator.  Oh, no, because he, I guess he wasn't showing up for his real job.  Why would he if he's going to be on CNN every day?  He's on CNN, like, yeah, what do you need to do?  He's on CNN.  He's on CNN.  So what did he kind of do in his job? 
[03:02:30]  So dedicated to doing that CNN simulator thing.  Okay.  You know, and then, and then, and then, and then the other thing with the malaria, 
[03:03:00]  and then the other thing with the crime. 
[03:03:30]  of the plane, the middle of the plane, or the  we  get out of the plane.  You know what?  Tied up  a calf. 
[03:04:00]  Tied up  a calf.  a calf.  a calf.  t쳐 бы  abynoutine. 
[03:04:30]  tя  ciance  t做  How good is that?  Wow.  Whatever, however it sounds.  And the audience, obviously, is, I hope they'd be multilingual.  We'll find out.  It's going to be, it's kind of, I did Sweden once, and most of them really kind of got it. 
[03:05:00]  And the weirdest thing in Sweden was this kid coming up, a Swedish kid who'd been following  me for years on, I don't know, you know, trying to be Swedish, Swedish, with a tattoo of me  on his leg.  Wow.  Like hanging around and just wanting to, you know, just, can I get a picture?  Okay, great.  Wow.  You know, it was like dedication. 
[03:05:30]  Crazy.  What's the matter with you?  Well, at least, Louis, if you're going to go to see a comedian in another, in another  country, at least go to see one who's really easy to understand.  I can't wait to watch a Norwegian trying to give you a, I'm a little bit of a rewarder.  What?  What did they say?  Do you, do you, like, take in some of the local sites when you're there?  You're just batting down in the.  I don't know.  I've got, uh, Belgium's drawing and Amsterdam and Rotterdam are drawing, and then, uh, I've 
[03:06:00]  got a place that's Bergen, uh, Bergen, Norway.  There's about 50 people.  So, I have no idea.  Bergen said the same thing, though.  Bill went over, I heard he had, he was smart, though, he handed out some DVDs just for free  to give people, like, something to pass around. 
[03:06:30]  Never.  Never.  I don't really, uh, like playing England.  I like playing Ireland.  Because they kind of got a, I don't, you know.  Got a hard-on.  They got a kind of a stick up their hand.  And, you know, that kind of thing.  You know, that little.  You know.  Was he doing a Shaq selfie there? 
[03:07:00]  Lewis Black is it?  Yes.  I find the Irish and the Scottish to be more, you know.  Uh, so I went to play there, and I come on stage.  And they just started yelling.  And then I had, like, uh, and, and finally, I, I, once, once I played the first night, the 
[03:07:30]  second night I came out, and I said, listen, you pieces of shit, here's the deal.  I don't know what you think that we've got, that you don't have, that we're blowing it.  Yeah.  So that, you're the turd that went down the, down the goddamn toilet first.  Why don't you look up and watch the turd that's following you?  Wow.  And, but I had to do that to calm those fucks down.  Right, calm them down. 
[03:08:00]  Who are they yelling at you?  Fuck you, American piece of shit.  You know, that's not funny.  There you take it.  All of this stuff.  They just yell shit.  Wow.  I had guys, well, I, these, one night, halfway through the act, and they drink, you know,  they're really, they don't, they don't hold it well.  Not like the Irish, goddammit, not like the Irish.  They can drink.  And they say, they're tossing a bag, and these Welsh guys start yelling shit at me.  Now that, they're incomprehensible.  Yeah, that's all wacky language right there.  That's a wacky, and I just finally went, and I paused, and I went, I went, holy shit, 
[03:08:30]  I said, I have no idea what you're saying, but I do realize, now I used to think it  was Wales, you know, the home of Richard Burton, and Dylan Thomas, and all of many great...  Tom Jones.  Yes.  And I said, and now I realize you're just the Alabama of England.  Oh, shit. 
[03:09:00]  Ireland.  Were they the same five years ago?  But the, uh, the, uh... 
[03:09:30]  I mean, Will Oliver, for fucking sake, I better work with him years ago, and I went...  John Oliver?  Huh?  John Oliver?  Yeah.  John Oliver.  Huh?  Did you say John Oliver?  Yeah.  John Oliver.  Oh, Jesus!  You play it out in your head. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  So...  John Oliver.  John Oliver.  Yeah.  John Oliver.  John Oliver.  I'm sorry.  You play it out in your head.  John Oliver.  Sorry.  It's a joke.  That's a joke.  hey guys um lewis i first of all i enjoy your work and i've seen you a couple times 
[03:10:30]  was my daughter has enjoyed the the ride to  daycare because all she said the full-time is mister b  meeting 
[03:11:00]  uh...  that  three damn that's like the dice commercial where where is the the hamster right  right cage yeah that one yeah you can't just put words together again 
[03:11:30]  i i i saw that  until somebody said  uh...  people  it may be the you know the daily shelly show does well well but but the these  guys are really 
[03:12:00]  go a step it's this  they really knifled some stuff  and i just keep waiting i said  go  go  go  go 
[03:12:30]  really is infuriating at times and especially when you just get on like the first time because  you don't know how to handle it now me and jim we were just talking before  140 character at a clip argument that would 
[03:13:00]  and i try try not to like  i  some little private messages and i just blocked them i was like  completely dis 
[03:13:30]  see if you said like i don't agree with that but you didn't say that no  you want me to  nicely saying fuck you  i should unblock him but still  he knows he wasn't being polite of course he knows that  and then plus it's 140 characters where you can really  you got it  you got it  you got it 
[03:14:00]  you got it  you got it  you got it  you got it  Thank you. 
[03:14:30]  Thank you. 
[03:15:00]  Fuck, can guitar hero get rocked?  Fuck, you fuck.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because it's such a strange name.  An actual movie coming out?  Yeah, it's going to be, there's some time.  But I got to meet Sam Elliott, which just about made my day.  Sam Elliott.  Yeah, he was, he was.  I wouldn't say that was a ringing endorsement of your love of Sam Elliott. 
[03:15:30]  It just about made my day.  Just about, almost did.  Felt slightly short.  If it wasn't for craft services being delicious, Sam Elliott would have been a highlight.  Did you get a picture?  Huh?  No.  I'm always like, it always happens like when I'm about halfway away from the place.  Oh, fucking idiot.  Sure, you got a picture.  So you still get excited meeting other celebrities.  That's cool.  Well, that was great.  But it's rare, right?  It is that I get excited.  Yeah.  Like someone where you go, wow, cool. 
[03:16:00]  But him is like, he was, he's legendary.  Because I just think he's legendary in the big Lebowski.  Right.  And plus his voice is so, you know, archetypical American voice.  It's that voice of me.  He's the guy you want in charge of shit.  The beef commercials.  Yeah.  You know.  Beef, it's what's for dinner.  Yeah, it is.  He's right.  Right.  But cartoon wise.  Yeah, pretty simple.  I'm doing, which is pretty extraordinary, I'm doing a Pixar movie. 
[03:16:30]  Whoa, there you go.  And that's pretty big.  Some of that Pixar money.  Nice.  We'll see.  We'll see how much.  Yeah, we'll see.  You know, it's not rolling in.  But working with them is un-fucking-lievable.  They really, they've managed to situate themselves outside of Berkeley.  They're like up in, up past San Francisco.  They got this, it's like, it's this fucking nice campus.  And then they, and they fucking, it's three, they, they got in touch with me in 2012. 
[03:17:00]  We, the movie will come out in, and there's 70% finish with it.  And it comes out in 2000, July, 2015.  Wow.  And, and this is really extraordinary, was it, which you never see humility from out there.  They sent me a whole package with pictures of what the, you know, the basic rough sketches  and what the thing was about and da-da-da-da. 
[03:17:30]  And you may not have heard of us, but we are, we were Pixar.  We sent along a book to show you the, the ones and to give you an idea of some of the  films we've done.  And we really would hope that you would work with us on this project.  Can I, can I jump in here and take my take?  They, let me, that, that is false humility.  They knew goddamn well you knew who they were.  That's like, that's like De Niro introducing himself and going, maybe you've seen my work  and then handing you the fucking Godfather 2. 
[03:18:00]  But, but as opposed to, as opposed to what they could send, hey, we're Pixar and we'll  put our finger really hard up your ass.  How would you like that?  So to me, it was kind of, I know exactly what you mean, but it's that other thing.  It was a nice way they approached it.  They approached it at least, you know, and they, and they are great to work with.  They really are.  Who do you play?  Or what do you play?  This is perfect. 
[03:18:30]  I play, uh, the, um, voice of anger inside a 12-year-old girl's head.  Oh.  In the, so I can make my transition.  Right.  To tranny.  Hey, thank you.  Hey, come back around.  It's that language.  It's a winner.  We got Dan in Pennsylvania.  We got Lewis Black in studio.  Dan.  Oh, hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I just want to thank Lewis for, uh...  I just want to thank Lewis for, uh...  Give him a minute. 
[03:19:00]  ...  You </pre>
