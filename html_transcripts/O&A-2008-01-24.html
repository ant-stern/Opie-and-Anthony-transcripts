<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a montage portraying them as "shock jocks" and a rambling introduction including a bizarre dream about a threesome.  The hosts then discussed their lack of a boss, reminiscing about negative experiences with former General Managers Ken Stevens (forced into retirement by one of their bits) and Scott Herman (who carried a baseball bat to meetings).  A lengthy segment followed speculating on Heath Ledger’s death, focusing on conflicting reports of drug use, a masseuse’s alleged involvement, and Mary-Kate Olsen’s security detail.  A fictional coroner, “Jim C,” provided increasingly absurd commentary.  The hosts mocked a snippet of Boston gossip columnists ("manatees").  Theories ranged from cover-up to murder.

The conversation shifted to a news story about a man who stole 1600 pairs of women’s underwear, leading to more crude jokes and a personal anecdote from Anthony about a childhood crush on a cousin, sparking a debate with Jimmy.  The show also covered media reactions to Ledger’s death, criticized inaccurate news reporting on a Syracuse snowstorm, included a call-in segment, and a “Guess the Sound” game revealing a woman being hit by a motorbike.  Upcoming guests Bob Kelly and T.J. Miller were mentioned.  The segment ended with banter about their shirts and irreverent style.

The next segment focused on the upcoming Super Bowl, particularly the Giants-Patriots rivalry and the New York Post’s perceived slight against Tom Brady, countered by a “missile” on the Boston Herald’s front page.  The Giants’ chances and Tony Romo’s breakup with Jessica Simpson were discussed, blaming Simpson for Romo’s poor performance and introducing a cynical theory about a woman’s “quota” of sex before a man loses interest.  The Super Bowl ticket lottery was heavily criticized, focusing on Ruby Baum’s decades-long loyalty and repeated failures to win tickets despite his seniority.  Listeners guessed sounds, often vulgarly, interspersed with commercials and promotions for Bob Kelly and Bill Burr.  A poorly-made Patriots Super Bowl song was mocked.  Ruby Baum himself called, expressing frustration, and the hosts promised to help him get tickets.  The segment ended with discussion of "Cloverfield," a studio interview with T.J. Miller, and a preview of a humorous Heath Ledger “street interview.”

The following segment began with a discussion about Ruby Baum winning Super Bowl tickets but not travel expenses.  This transitioned into a sexually explicit discussion about whether the hosts and colleagues would have sex with their cousins.  JJ Abrams and T.J. Miller then joined the show, discussing the success of *Cloverfield*, its filming style, hidden references (including a *Lost* Easter egg), *Star Trek*, and its production.  Jim Norton joined, commenting on *Lost*’s emotional depth.  T.J. Miller shared a humorous anecdote from the *Star Trek* set.  The conversation then turned to a news story about a male nurse charged with sexually abusing elderly patients, prompting graphic and offensive humor.  Further discussion of *Cloverfield* followed, along with more calls and off-topic banter.

The next segment ranked the creepiness of professions (mail nurse, ice cream truck driver, high school swim coach), segued into graphic sexual humor involving ice cream trucks and wasps, and then focused on a Canadian man who survived by eating rotting beaver meat.  The hosts and callers offered crude commentary, playing an audio clip of the man explaining his survival methods.  T.J. Miller rejoined, and the conversation turned to graphic jokes about the size of his genitalia.  Miller discussed his upcoming appearance on *Late Show with David Letterman* and past late-night appearances.  "The Inventor and Epstein" sketch was discussed, detailing a “bit war” with Than and Travis.  Various versions of the sketch were played. The segment ended with further discussion of Heath Ledger's death (including a David Caruso impression), mention of a future "Than and Sam show," and promotion of upcoming segments.

The final segment began with office banter involving an intern, Brian, quickly devolving into crude jokes about Anthony's penis size.  Roland, responsible for distributing DVDs, was brought in to discuss the reception of "UFO Hunters."  The conversation returned to sexually explicit jokes about Anthony's penis size, escalating into a rapid-fire exchange of listener-submitted jokes using increasingly outrageous similes and metaphors.  The segment concluded abruptly with promotional announcements and a final joke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Wow, Jesus.  I'm sorry.  Usually I'm alright.  That one is...  I've been dropping them all morning.  I can't help it.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Oh my God, my eyes are tearing.  I had a dream that I had a threesome.  This is the absolute truth with Tom Chiasano.  Oh my God.  Oh. 
[00:01:00]  It looks like a lemon party with one chick.  This is where entertainment is going.  Shut up, you f***ing moron.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Alright.  Wow.  If we pull this off, we're going to be...  What?  Employed.  Employed.  Employed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is it?  Yeah, you were trying... 
[00:01:30]  I can't help it.  You were trying to get us to support your awful shirt, but...  No, it's awful.  They're goofing on me.  I'm reading, when's your tea time, Anthony?  When do you hit the links?  It's just a little collared striped shirt.  It's nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It's a striped shirt.  You've never seen a picture of Ernie or Bert from Sesame Street.  I wasn't going for an Ernie or Bert look, but...  With slightly more T-cells. 
[00:02:00]  Do you know...  Do you know, as I'm going through my closet there this morning, I pass that god-awful periwinkle  shirt every so often, which I still have, and would never put on.  And then I put this on, and I get the abuse anyway, so...  Leave us alone!  It's all I had.  I need laundry done.  All right, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Hi, good morning.  What are we up to?  Day four without a boss.  Yes.  And no new boss in sight.  No.  No rumblings.  What is this company doing?  Who's going to be the new guy here in New York City?  Who wants to take responsibility for this program?  Anyone?  Hello?  Hello?  Anyone?  Hello?  No?  You'd have to be crazy to step up to this job.  They all know.  All the past GMs are like, oh, no. 
[00:03:00]  Tom could handle it.  He ruled with an iron fist.  He was used to it for 20 years, dealing with Howard and this and that and the other thing.  And no one else wants to play with us.  No.  A little known fact, all our past GMs, they meet every Tuesday night.  Yep.  Kind of a rehab thing.  Yeah.  Kind of like GM rehab.  They all get together.  Hi, my name is Ken Stevens and I was their boss for four years. 
[00:03:30]  I'm doing better now.  Now that I was forced into retirement by one of their bits.  I had the B-B-Boys under my direction for a couple of years.  Mr. Mittman, yes?  Would you like to speak?  The mistake I made was offering them a $2,000 raise after they became the hottest thing in  Boston radio.  I'm paying for it to this day.  I do remember sitting out for quite a long time for the mayor's prank. 
[00:04:00]  Then he got another GM from the B-A-B days that collects knives and works for a newspaper.  We have pretty much destroyed.  We've left GMs just thrown about.  The bodies strewn in the wake of this disaster.  Sure.  But the ride's fun.  Yeah, good luck to the new guy. 
[00:04:30]  It's fun when things are going good.  Scott Herman.  Let's not forget about Scott Herman.  Scott.  Walked around with a baseball bat and man, did he want to hit us over the head with that  thing.  We had a lot of meetings with him.  Yeah.  He was always dragging us up into his office and yelling at us for something with the  bat in the corner.  Oh, because he didn't want to deal with us.  No.  He was in charge of a news station.  We're at an old news station.  You don't have news readers acting up.  We have to sit him down and go, hey, you know that AP story you read at 707?  Do not editorialize. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  I don't even remember all the other GMs.  There's just too many to mention here.  But we're going to have a new one soon.  Soon a new person will walk in here and introduce themselves to us, our audience, as the new boss.  Same as the old boss.  Yeah, well.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  We don't have one right as of yet.  So just kind of do the show.  And the company is not talking to us about what they're thinking of doing. 
[00:05:30]  There's no rumblings, like you said.  No.  No emails.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  Heath Ledger, day two.  Is he still nude?  It's a who gives a crap.  Well, they finally calmed down on the whole nude thing. 
[00:06:00]  I think the news finally realized, like, why, even they realized, why do we have to bring that up every two seconds?  Right.  That his nude body was found.  So now they're just saying he was found, you know, face down.  I wanted to say this yesterday.  I'm going to say it today.  Uh-oh.  Heath Ledger, in my humble opinion, OD'd on the H.  You think so?  OD'd on the H, I tell you.  All right.  Well, I got a couple of questions for you then. 
[00:06:30]  Yes.  How come the police said they found no illegal drugs in the apartment?  You got a suspicious masseuse that was over there, and she was supposed to rub him down,  and she pretty much discovered that he was dead.  Cold to the touch, by the way.  I'm reading in the paper today.  Ooh.  Although the maid, way to pay attention, she said he was snoring when she was cleaning out the apartment.  Went in to change a light bulb, I believe, in the room.  Right.  Because his door was shut and heard him snoring. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And that was probably a death rattle, and she didn't even identify it as a death rattle.  Oh, sweet dreams to her.  Yeah.  Good one.  She's got to take that with her for a while.  Hey, watch him.  I bet he died of sleep apnea.  Like Reggie White.  Maybe the pills kept him from waking up.  Yeah, probably.  Why don't we all throw what we think on the table here, and then we'll see who's right.  I'm going to go with the OD, and it's going to be the H.  And I think the masseuse who called Mary Kate Olson, who was, I guess, dating Heath Ledger back there in California, 
[00:07:30]  she was sending her private people, private security people.  They're calling them rent-a-cops.  What was that about?  And the masseuse was on the phone with Mary Kate Olson.  This is a mystery now.  They didn't call 911 right away.  No.  She called Mary Kate Olson, who said, all right, I'm calling my security people, and they'll be there.  And they arrived before the cops did.  What else was discussed on the phone?  So perhaps what you are implying, in your humble opinion, is that these security people may have cleared out the apartment of any contraband before the police arrived. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  Because I was also reading in the paper today a lot of these pill experts are coming out of the woodwork,  and they're saying that it's almost impossible to OD on the stuff he had in his apartment.  But then I'm reading in the paper that if you take this Valium or too much Xanax and you drink a whole lot, that you could stop breathing. 
[00:08:30]  It could be a lethal combination?  That's what the paper says.  Who do you believe?  They say these pills have kind of like a safeguard.  Like you'd have to take a lot of them.  Yeah, yeah.  You'd have to take a lot, but maybe he was.  Now remember, I just skim things in the morning, so don't take what I just said as truth and all of a sudden start popping pills because you're tired tonight.  But they're saying there's like a leeway there.  Like they're basically saying if you take an extra one, you're not going to like OD. 
[00:09:00]  Right, right.  It has to be a lot of extra ones.  What that number is, I don't know, and I'm not going to try to attempt to figure that one out.  Maybe you could experiment on your own.  On your own.  They'd find you.  So that's what I'm thinking.  And then the Boston Hurl, the inside track, the manatees.  The manatees, just the worst as far as writing a gossip column.  These are two yentas that sit there up in Boston and just yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip about everything. 
[00:09:30]  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  And then they eat to keep their massive bodies.  Yeah, see, we got page six here in New York.  They got the inside track in Boston.  That's pretty popular.  Pretty much every city has the gossip columnist.  Their dirt that they dish.  And these asses, they go to the parties and the restaurants and the clubs, and they're in the dark corner.  You know it's them because they don't look like the people that are invited to these parties. 
[00:10:00]  You know, the model types and stuff.  No, they're just...  The Hollywood types.  They're just two manatees in the corner.  They're in a dark corner, hoping they're going to be accepted, but they're never going to be accepted.  No.  And they're in that corner.  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  to jotting stuff down, jotting.  They're jotting and yipping.  That's their job, to jot and yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip. 
[00:10:30]  And then I got actual audio of the manatees as they're trying to get, you know, their story on the inside track.  Well, that ain't working.  That sounded like them walking in the room.  Yeah, where's our little freaking Fred Flintstone twinkle toe?  Oh, twinkle toes.  Ah, whatever.  Damn, yeah, when they're walking around the...  They're going from shadow to shadow.  There they are.  There they are. 
[00:11:00]  It's like, what was that in the shadows?  Right.  Jot, jot, jot, jot.  And then, oh, I think they see us.  They go back into their dark corner.  Back to another dark corner somewhere in the room.  Oh, quick, behind the couch.  What are they saying?  Let's lean over the couch and listen.  Jot, jot, jot.  Shook, shook, shook, shook, shook, shook, shook, shook.  And then they get...  They end up getting some really good info.  Some really good inside info.  These gossip columnists in general. 
[00:11:30]  But then, this is what really makes me hate them.  Then they're not brave enough to actually print names.  No.  They pretty much know a bombshell fact about a huge star or a huge sports celebrity, what have you.  And then they kind of leave his name out because they're not brave enough to print the name because they're going to get sued.  Get in trouble.  Or they talk very vaguely.  And this is where this whole thing was leading to.  Inside track this morning.  Ooh.  The masseuse. 
[00:12:00]  The Heath Ledger masseuse.  Yeah.  Who I told you yesterday looked a little, eh, there's something going on with her, right?  Eh.  She comes over there on a regular basis to rub him down.  Well, the inside track is saying today that the masseuse who found the body of actor Heath Ledger works on Martha's Vineyard in the summer, rubbing many celebs the right way, dot, dot, dot.  Now, what could that possibly mean?  The right way.  They're basically saying she will perform the Yankee Cranky. 
[00:12:30]  They're basically.  Chot, chot.  This is what they're basically saying, but they're not brave enough to go the distance with this.  Yeah.  When you say rub celebrities the right way, dot, dot, dot, that means you're getting more than a freaking massage.  Yeah.  But they don't want to go any further than what they wrote today in the inside track.  You're getting a happy ending.  So she's extremely suspicious.  And I guess she traveled with Heath Ledger.  This was a masseuse, you know, to rub him down here and there. 
[00:13:00]  And she said in an exclusive interview that she had some kind of special relationship with Heath and Mary Kate Olson.  Hmm.  So she felt comfortable enough to call Mary Kate Olson.  And that's where I'm starting to think there's there's something that is not being told to us yet.  Yep.  Something is going on.  And I'm going with the H.  The O.D.  Well, they will know with toxicology reports.  You can't hide that.  Right.  So. 
[00:13:30]  Well, this is just terrific.  Heath Ledger coverage day two.  Day two.  How long will this last?  We're not going to go crazy like we did yesterday.  No.  Because, you know, this is already fading away.  Yeah.  We've got other things to do.  We've got a Super Bowl to talk about and other things.  Sure.  CBS talks to a mother who brought her young daughter to Brooklyn to pay her respects.  What?  Yes.  Last night, fans continue to show their grief.  Debbie Fontana drove her distraught daughter, Melanie, from Long Island to Ledger's Manhattan apartment 
[00:14:00]  and Michelle Williams Brooklyn home to leave flowers and pay their respects.  She's just devastated.  She's been a fan of his since day one.  Why would you drag your kid around and just make the grief that much worse?  Just buy the kid something.  That's what they did in the old days.  You buy the kid a toy.  Get their mind off of it.  Buy her a copy of A Knight's Tale. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Smack him around and tell him stop whining.  Right.  Get a hold of yourself.  Yeah.  Pick yourself up by your bootstraps.  The CW talks to a woman who works at a restaurant Heath used to go to sometimes.  Steve Ledger's unexpected death has many trying to figure out if he was under any emotional distress in recent weeks.  Ledger recently told a New York Times reporter that he felt a tremendous amount of stress  while filming the Bob Dylan biopic, I'm Not There. 
[00:15:00]  But many of those who work at some of his favorite restaurants in Manhattan say they saw no signs of trouble.  Yeah, he was just in here two months ago.  It's a little surreal.  Two months?  But, I mean, he was in here for probably half an hour.  He stopped in for the party and seemed like a regular, but he seemed okay.  The news sucks.  They just talked to a woman that saw him for maybe a half hour.  Not even the full time because it's a restaurant, so she's probably working or doing something.  He's in there a total of a half hour two months ago. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And that's their exclusive eyewitness.  He seemed okay.  Yeah, he seemed okay.  People are delusional.  They think if you have a drug problem that you're going to walk into a restaurant and just be completely insane.  Yeah, out of control.  There are people walking among us.  There are people working among us that have really bad drug problems.  And guess what you don't know about?  You got people that are on the H right around you.  And you have no clue. 
[00:16:00]  They're able to hide it.  The hamburgers.  H for hamburger?  Yes.  They think they're going to say, hello, how are you?  And you're going to go, not good.  I'm on drugs.  I'm on the dope.  Right.  Did you tie me off before you bring my eggs?  Where are my works?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where are the works?  I'm just saying.  This is what I'm thinking.  I have no clue.  I don't have any connection to this thing.  Mary Kate Olsen is apparently, let's see, she is like Marsalis Wallace. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  And then she sends over her security people who are like the wolf.  Okay.  To chill them, to chill them niggas out.  Oh!  Well, that's from Pulp Fiction.  Leave me alone.  But, uh.  Wow.  You know, that is what her job is now.  Oh, you feel better now, mother.  So, so she, you know, she gets a phone call from a very distraught, uh, person. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Saying that there's a problem.  Yeah.  They got a problem.  Yeah.  Saying that this apartment is not dead actor storage.  Yeah.  And, uh, then.  Dead actor storage.  Dead actor storage.  And, uh, she sends over the wolf who will arrive shortly.  And, uh, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  And cleans up the whole problem.  And then, uh, I guess they all went to a diner.  I really believe that there was a cleaning up of the problem.  That's what I think.  I really do.  And they found, what, a $20 bill rolled up?  Rolled up $20.  Which was clean.  Yeah, there was no dope in there.  But, this is what I say.  Maybe we could get Jim C.  The wolf is very, um.  In this discussion.  Thorough.  But I'm thinking, if you're going to be rolling up, uh, you know,  some bills to do some stuff.  Yeah.  Ah, you roll up more than one. 
[00:18:00]  You, would you?  Why not?  Would you?  Um.  Because I never did.  Yeah.  I never had more than one after you buy some.  Yeah.  I never even had one.  The system was filled with methamphetamines and barbiturates, Sam.  Whoa, Jim C.  Jim C making an appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  The coroner, Jim C.  Yes, Jim C.  It looks like murder.  Does it? 
[00:18:30]  How could it be murder when nobody, uh, was there, uh, until he was dead, really?  There were pills scattered all over the bed, Sam.  Oh, Jim C's so passionate.  He really is.  Now, I see you're running your finger down a leg.  Is that Heath Ledger's or your flat-ass companion on the boat?  It's a cardboard cutout I took, and I talked to it on the boat.  Take your tiny genitals out of here, assistant Sam. 
[00:19:00]  We have a homoerotic relationship.  Wow.  Wow, man.  To hear it right from Jim C.  It's, uh, fascinating.  She lays on her stomach, and I do lines off her flat-ass.  It's like a mirror.  Jim C rules.  Oh, we love Jim C.  Jim C gets to the bottom of everything.  Of course, it's always murder.  Murder.  Murder.  It doesn't matter what it is. 
[00:19:30]  Ah, God.  I'm looking for, there was a term they used, because they determined he was dead for a couple  hours, because it's a term they used for when the blood, after you die.  Blood pulls up.  After you die, this is what's really pleasant about the whole thing.  Your blood decides to use gravity.  Yeah.  It doesn't pump around your body anymore.  No.  Oh, Kenny, you know the term?  Because they used the term in the paper today.  Oh, God, I know it.  At least he does.  He's living with it.  And it creeped me out.  Yes.  Lividity.  Lividity, yes!  Hit a bell or something for Kenny. 
[00:20:00]  Showing his smarts this morning.  Lividity, get your ass in here.  Lividity?  Yeah, it's called lividity.  And that's when, when you die, the blood immediately just, you know, it doesn't need  to be pumped around anymore.  It starts pooling up.  So it just starts pooling, right.  At the bottom.  Wherever the gravity is, you know.  Oh, boy.  And you get the little bluer.  So it turns blue over there.  And that's why they're saying he was dead for a couple hours by the time they went there  to revive him.  So he must have been in the throes of death when that stupid maid walked in. 
[00:20:30]  And he was snoring.  Yeah, while she's whistling a happy tune with her dumb duster.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fighting for his life internally.  She probably could have saved him.  I'm guessing apnea.  Yeah.  All right, Jimmy's going with apnea.  I'm saying the pills kept him from waking up.  I'm going with the H.  What are you going with?  Wow, you're going with that.  I'm going with Jim C.  Murder.  Yes.  I went with blunt trauma to the head yesterday.  I don't think that's panning out. 
[00:21:00]  No, it's not.  I don't think it's panning out.  Quincy would always show up to a murder scene in like a members-only jacket.  That awful like tan members-only jacket.  Yeah.  Getting nothing done.  Explosions all happening around the coroner.  For some reason, yeah, the coroner's right at the scene as the crime's still happening.  Waiting for someone to die.  Yes.  To be murdered.  Yes.  Botulism.  You just got to throw out words that can hurt you.  Hey, I want to squeeze this in.  You got NBC locally here talking to a tattoo artist. 
[00:21:30]  You know, this is how close.  Ah, another close person to Heath Ledger.  Meanwhile, tributes continue to pour into the Australian-born actor in Soho and in front  of his former home in Brooklyn, where Ledger wrote the name of his young daughter Matilda  and the sidewalk.  The same name this man recently tattooed on the actor's body.  Now Ledger's name is permanently etched on his.  He was an electric, brilliant, wise, way beyond his years, gentle, fragile, warmest, most 
[00:22:00]  down-to-earth, beautiful, creative artist.  What are things that a man says about another man that he's been sleeping with?  Oh, damn it.  I get it.  He was terrific.  Hold on.  I might want to hear that clip again.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I might want to hear that again.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  You ready?  Okay, let her rip.  Meanwhile, tributes continue to pour into the Australian-born actor in Soho and in front  of his former home in Brooklyn, where Ledger wrote the name of his young daughter Matilda  on the sidewalk.  The same name this man recently tattooed on the actor's body.  Now Ledger's name is permanently etched on his. 
[00:23:00]  Clues.  This is an electric, brilliant, wise, way beyond his years.  Einstein.  Jim Norton.  Beautiful, creative, artist.  All right.  They don't all work.  Eric Nagel.  Eric Nagel.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  He was a beautiful, bouncy, horse's ass.  Man stole 1,600 pairs of blank breasts. 
[00:23:30]  We'll tell you next.  O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, why don't you get out of bed?  It's time.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  I want to say good morning to Syracuse.  Yes.  They're showing it snowing in Syracuse down here in New York City. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And they're making it look like it's a complete disaster up there.  How much snow?  And I know a little bit about Syracuse from my time in western New York.  But yeah, you made the drive to Syracuse every once in a while.  Syracuse is laughing this morning.  Yeah.  Three and a half inches.  That's nothing.  That's nothing for Syracuse.  Nothing.  Ride your bicycle in that.  Right.  Nothing.  That's just an average day in Syracuse in the winter. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, if it was here?  Oh, my gosh.  It'd be freaking.  Oh, we're a bunch of wimps when it comes to snow, that's for sure.  Yeah.  New York likes to think that we're tougher than everybody else.  But when it comes to things like a little ice on the road or a little snow,  we kind of wimp out.  Yeah, we totally do.  And, you know, everybody said this,  but I do remember winters being a little more brutal years ago.  You know, you got a lot more snow.  They didn't have the plowing down yet. 
[00:25:00]  They didn't know how to work it out logistically.  So, you know, some streets got plowed, some didn't.  Right.  And that just doesn't happen anymore.  So when they freak out that we're going to get three inches of snow,  it means nothing.  Nothing.  When I lived in Buffalo, I mean, it would just snow and snow and snow.  That's real snow.  And people would still go to the mall and the bars and the restaurants.  I'm sorry.  Smug guy's blocking traffic.  He's in the middle of a lane. 
[00:25:30]  You know, the news has really got to knock it off.  I would be killing him.  Do they understand there's people like me on the road?  I'm not just going to slowly go by smug guy.  He's getting clipped with my mirror.  Smug guy.  Sorry.  It was so distracting.  Cars had to move and merge because he was standing in the middle of a lane.  He was completely in a lane.  And yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like he was going to get hit by that cab.  He should have. 
[00:26:00]  And it threw us out of a boring bit anyway.  That's fine.  Let's say hi to Chris in Syracuse.  Good morning, Chris.  Good morning, O.  How are you?  All right.  Hey, there's no snow here.  There's probably enough to cover your fingernail.  Nothing, huh?  They're saying three and a half inches.  They were showing like coverage of snow coming down in Syracuse.  They got it all about 15, 20 miles north of Syracuse.  Oh, see, it's not even in Syracuse.  That's what they do here.  See, that's all we know.  It's snowing in Syracuse.  That's what they just told us.  Yeah.  When it snows upstate and in like western New Jersey, 
[00:26:30]  they say a lot of snow predicted for our area.  And it's one town.  And they mean like the area of the tri-state area.  Right.  One mountain town gets like.  Yeah.  Walloped.  So it snows upstate New York.  It's like, well, we could get a dusting here.  A dusting.  So there's not much snow up there where you're at.  No, not at all.  I'm sitting right in Syracuse,  and I'm just looking at a little dust in the snow on the ground.  No surprise that the news got it wrong. 
[00:27:00]  All right, Chris, thank you.  All right, Chip.  By the way, who's got the Austin Power, like, stingers and stuff?  Ooh.  I got an idea.  The suspense ones?  Every time you see the masseuse.  Yeah.  Heath Ledger's masseuse on TV.  They're showing her a lot now.  Just hit that thing.  Yeah.  I don't care if we're in the middle of talking about something else.  Every time you see her, we got three TVs on in the studio.  Oh, jeez.  I got the one behind you. 
[00:27:30]  Every time you see her, just hit that thing.  Is she pretty?  Because I'm starting to take a close look at this thing.  Yeah.  You think guilty.  There's something going on.  What would that be?  Would that be a crime?  Tampering?  Of course.  Evidence?  Yes.  Is it?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Scene of a death.  So we got a guy that stole 1,600 pairs of breasts.  Jimmy was right.  Oh, it couldn't possibly be.  You could steal those.  Here's the answer.  In Washington State, a panty thief, sentenced to 45 days behind bars. 
[00:28:00]  Garth Flaherty was charged with theft after stealing more than 1,600 panties, bras, and  other women's underwear.  Police say he took them from apartment laundry rooms at the Washington State University campus.  Garbage bags filled with the undergarments were found in his bedroom.  Flaherty pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors.  Deal?  Garbage bags. 
[00:28:30]  A deal?  At the end of that?  A deal.  Piled guilty with a deal.  A deal?  What is that?  Who talks that way?  In his bedroom, Flaherty pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors.  A deal.  A deal?  Piled guilty with a deal.  A big deal.  We yell at our listeners for, like, pointing out the dumb stuff we do on this show, but we  have no problem doing the exact same thing.  Yeah, picking apart every word, people say.  How many times have we told our listeners, give us a break, it's early.  Oh, we're the worst. 
[00:29:00]  We should still be sleeping, not trying to entertain you, F.  A deal.  A deal.  A deal.  Panties, though.  That many panties.  You gotta think he probably just would dump them out on his bed and roll around in them.  He's got a problem, I'm saying.  It was at a college thing, though?  They were college panties?  Yeah, but how many college girl panties do you really need?  I mean, you know, one or two.  But let's say you throw them on your bed.  See, this is the first image that came to my head when I heard garbage bags full. 
[00:29:30]  You dump them out on your bed, and now you're just covered in them, and you're rolling around  in them, just, you know, doing what you gotta do.  Mm-hmm.  With maybe a special pair.  One that didn't make it into the washing machine for us.  Well, when, you know, when you were growing up, if you came upon a pair of panties...  Yum.  Like your mother's, which I did find.  Ooh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, yuck.  The ones that look like they were worn on an Indian lady's forehead. 
[00:30:00]  Mothers always had the biggest, ugliest, dopiest panties.  Thank God, because I'd hate to think I was, you know, gonna get turned on by them.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want to see your mother's panties and have, like, their crotchless.  Yeah.  Who needs that?  I had a crush on one of my cousins growing up.  You know what?  Went over her house.  No, no, no, no.  You don't just pass that by.  You don't just casually pass that by.  Well, I did.  This comes up from time to time.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not supposed to have a crush on your cousin ever. 
[00:30:30]  No, but you do, you do, growing up, especially at that age, you know, it was, like, anywhere  between, I think.  No, no, you don't.  12.  You don't.  I'm not, we can't just let you slide on this one.  12, between, like, 12 and 16, I think I really, you know, kind of, I probably would  have had sex with her.  I probably would have.  Fine?  Yeah.  It's not fine, Jimmy.  Why not?  You're the voice of reason for once.  I didn't.  Just because, not for lack of, I wasn't trying, I wasn't really pursuing it, like, trying, 
[00:31:00]  but if she would have turned around and said, okay, I would have, probably.  All right.  Yeah, I would have.  This cousin, how is she related to you?  I know she's a cousin, but I mean.  No, no, it's first cousin.  Okay, so it's the first cousin.  It's who's kid.  I don't think I should say at this point.  Oh, my God.  Of course you shouldn't.  At least you're acknowledging that it's wrong.  Jimmy, it's wrong.  But it was years ago. 
[00:31:30]  It's wrong.  It was years ago, and she was very hot.  You share the same blood.  That's creepy.  That's the beauty of it.  No one needs tests.  Share some other fluids.  Exactly.  Here's blood.  Here's spit.  Here's something else.  A little bleachy enjoyed.  Cuz.  Cuz.  You shouldn't have sex with someone where you can recognize the smell.  Here it is.  Oh, Jesus.  Boy, that sums it up.  Sure does.  See, what I'm saying is.  Dude, I even got. 
[00:32:00]  It was during that time of life where you're just like pumping the hormones.  Like, just.  Like, I was a goat.  Just a horn dog.  And she was very attractive.  And I probably would have.  Did she have big doughy eyes like you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  And it would have been like having sex with me.  It would have been fantastic for myself.  Oh, me is staring at each other.  No, no.  Not the same last name. 
[00:32:30]  And from different.  Not the same last name.  All right.  So it's your mom's sister's kid.  Damn it.  No.  Well, my father was an only child.  So.  Kind of blows that whole thing to hell.  But.  But.  But.  But.  It was just one of those things.  Like, I thought about it.  But couldn't do it.  And it would have.  Let's say.  How old were you?  Something happened.  22, 23?  No, no.  I said anywhere between 12. 
[00:33:00]  I know.  And 16.  That's how old she was.  I was kind of like.  You know.  Kind of like had the hots for her.  And how old was she?  A little younger.  Yeah.  Just a little.  Not much.  Around the same age.  Yeah.  More or less.  All right.  But.  Went over their house once.  And.  I was using the bathroom off of her bedroom.  And I noticed that there were some panties on the floor.  And I thought that was very cool.  What did you do with them?  So.  Nothing.  I didn't do anything with them.  I really didn't.  I'd be completely honest with you. 
[00:33:30]  As a guy with the hormones, you know.  Rocketing through your body.  When you did come across a pair of panties.  Yeah.  Here and there.  It was really cool.  It was really cool.  Wow.  I know what goes in this thing.  Yeah.  It just gave you like an image like that.  Oh, yeah.  And I did pick them up and look inside.  Oh, there you go.  So I didn't do anything until I did investigate like CSI.  It's murder.  Yes.  She appeared to be 13 years old.  I could tell.  Because the body goes through changes, Sam.  Gypsy.  Oh, no. 
[00:34:00]  Gypsy's back.  Part of human development, Sam.  It's a time of confusion and hormones.  He's helping me out.  See?  Gypsy understands what a young man is going through during that time.  Anthony looked like he spilled botulism in his underwear, Sam.  It was very tough, you know.  Very confusing time for me.  We got a lot of phone calls coming in from Kentucky.  No.  I swear to God.  This is nothing to do. 
[00:34:30]  And they're all agreeing with you.  And let me tell you something.  It had nothing to do with love or wanting a relationship.  Because you hear about things like that.  Cousins marrying each other.  Things like that.  It was nothing to do with that.  It was blatant, just lust over a girl that had a great ass.  Do you think you're making this better, by the way?  It's not like I loved her.  I just liked my cousin because her ass was terrific.  There was no love there or feelings.  That would be almost nice.  That's why I valued her as a person. 
[00:35:00]  And that translated into sexual feelings.  No.  It was pure lust.  What?  This is terrible.  How do I always dig myself into a hole like this?  Just one innocent little statement from my youth.  And I end up having to defend myself with a coroner named Jimsy.  It's just horrid.  Was this your song?  Yeah.  Did you guys have a song? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, this was it.  It's kind of creepy, man.  I'm from a really big family.  Yeah.  And we're all really good looking.  And I never had that thought.  You never?  Did you ever think?  And I even have a cousin that's my cousin.  That's all that matters.  But there's no sharing of the blood.  She's adopted.  And even her.  Oh, please.  And she's beautiful.  No.  I'd do an adopted sister. 
[00:36:00]  Are you kidding?  Adopted?  If she was hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Like the Brady Bunch thing.  Yeah.  If you had a Marsha Brady.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I mean, if you had that, you'd be on that in a second.  But you never had a cousin that you looked at and thought was attractive.  Let's just say that.  I never said, I never said, yeah, see, you never had a cousin that you looked at and said,  well, there's a, she's turning into a pretty girl. 
[00:36:30]  I'm not falling for your game.  I'm not.  I'm not playing a game.  I'm just trying to.  You're not bringing me into your, your creepiness.  I'm real female.  Yes.  As a human being, you could tell if someone is good looking or not.  Uh-huh.  But that's very different than saying attractive.  Attractive means there's a little chemistry there.  Well, no, no.  Attractive means attractive.  It's, did you ever have a female cousin that you looked at and said, that's a pretty girl?  Look, at weddings, we might play who's, who's the ugliest cousin and fun games like that. 
[00:37:00]  But, attractive, no.  Because that makes it creepy.  No, it doesn't make it creepy.  It makes it, you're a guy looking at a girl.  And do you think, now to distinguish an ugly cousin from a pretty one, you have to then know that one is pretty.  See, you're using the word attractive to try to get me into your creepy world.  Creepy?  Yes.  Do I live in creepy world?  Yes, you do.  Look up, man.  Look up the definition.  You're not, Jimmy.  Look up the definition of attractive. 
[00:37:30]  See, this, you're using semantics, I mean, I'm not falling for that.  No.  I can tell if someone's good looking, yes.  Good looking.  But that doesn't mean I want to have sex with them or look at them as some kind of, yeah, like sex object.  You wouldn't look at a cousin that had a nice ass and a good set on her and look and go, wow, that's attractive.  You wouldn't?  You wouldn't notice it?  You wouldn't, because you're a cousin, you wouldn't even notice that she had a good ass on her. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, something inside, like, prevents you from going down that road.  Inside, all right.  What?  Prevents you from going down that road.  I could look at one of my cousins and go, yeah, she's good looking.  Yeah, there's something that prevents it.  But you are admitting that you would notice if she had a nice body.  You're not winning this today.  I know you're good at this crap, but you're not winning.  But I can see, I would absolutely notice, and in the same way I would notice if I got a deformity, I would notice that as well. 
[00:38:30]  It's like noticing something is not necessarily sexualizing.  That's what I'm trying to get at.  What, deformity?  You've just made it hotter.  Of course it is.  No legs.  Good luck running, toots.  Cleft palate.  Try to shut your mouth.  I don't want to do that.  You're getting this anyway.  I don't want to do it, I said.  I don't believe this.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Yeah, I got two questions for Anthony.  Yes.  Does your cousin have, like, Burt Convy hair like you do? 
[00:39:00]  And did you take her in the shower and try to teach her how to shower like your dad did?  Linger longer.  Yeah.  I'm Max from Dallas.  Linger longer.  Right.  Well, it's a little no fact that Anthony used to shower with his dad, too.  No, no, it was one time that he was teaching me and my brother how to go transition from  the bathtub as little kids to the shower.  Boy, really hard to figure that one out. 
[00:39:30]  Well, no, because we were little kids, so it's like.  Thank you, Dad, because if it wasn't for you, I would have drowned in here.  No, you got to teach how to, you know, where you had to wash and everything, because in  the tub, you just sit there and mommy washes you or whatever it is.  What?  And then in the shower, you're pretty much on your own.  So he was just trying to show, you know, how you use the washcloth and wash yourself.  But I was scared and didn't want to go near the shower.  If my dad was nude in front of me, I would have called the authorities. 
[00:40:00]  It was very dramatic.  It has to be.  I still think about it.  It's horrible.  He just wanted to show off what he was sporting.  He's like, God, I just need to show somebody.  I need somebody.  Look what God gave me.  I need somebody who has no relative comparison who will think this is impressive.  Right.  Give me the creeps.  That was pretty creepy.  Did he actually touch you in the shower?  No, no, no.  There was no physical contact whatsoever. 
[00:40:30]  And did he lift up, you know, parts of his body going, no, this is how you.  I don't remember because I couldn't get past the point that as the water runs down the human body, whatever is protruding off of that body, the water will run off of it like a waterfall or a stream of water.  Or water fountain.  So I thought that something was going on.  I thought that perhaps he should have used the toilet facilities before he went into the shower. 
[00:41:00]  But that wasn't the case.  It was just water running off.  And I was like, I don't want to go over there because you're, you know, you should be using the bathroom facilities.  Oh, my God.  But it was an optical illusion with the water running off.  See?  And it was very scary to me.  And that's all I remember.  And then everything goes black until 1978.  Where he's beating up a Mexican for hitting on you behind the shrubbery.  Yes, exactly.  No wonder you drink whenever you can. 
[00:41:30]  What?  Drowning these horrific memories from your childhood.  I do not.  It was just.  Oh, my God.  It was just the father trying to teach his boys how to shower properly.  I understand the context of it, even though at the time it was very horrifying to me because I thought he should have been using the bathroom facilities instead of being in the shower.  No one creeps me out.  This is the stuff you're admitting. 
[00:42:00]  I don't even want to know what you're holding back.  I honestly don't think I'm holding anything back because there's the sex with the cousin thing, which I didn't have if you're just tuning in.  I want to.  I would have.  My cousin was very attractive.  Let's hear it from your cousin.  Ant's cousin, yes.  Hey, this is Ant's cousin.  I want to let him know I thought he was a looker, too.  No, it wasn't a guy. 
[00:42:30]  It was a girl cousin.  Jeez, these people.  You can't fess up to anything on this program.  Not that, you know, that was just an innocent little thing.  Perhaps it is a little twisted.  I understand.  Did you play Wash the Scud?  No.  Let's say hi to Barry listening on BCN up there in Boston.  Go, Pats.  Go.  Barry, what do you got?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey. 
[00:43:00]  Ant, I can't believe you picked up the panties and looked in on that.  It's so gross.  Why?  Like, that was...  I wouldn't even pick up a supermodel's panties, man.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Dude, no.  Now you look like an idiot.  No way.  Panties?  Panties give you the...  It gives you a closer feel to what is in them.  What goes in them.  It really does.  Perhaps...  You ever see, like, a stray maybe is in there? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Like a stray got caught in there.  Or you see some suspicious markings.  Oh, my God.  Perhaps...  Things like that kind of give you more of a feel for what goes in there.  There were markings inside of it.  It looked like she stopped suddenly on a line of cranberry sauce, man.  Wow.  Those things are going to have to be put in the freezer at the morgue. 
[00:44:00]  Either she was very young or it was filled with eyelashes.  It is.  All right.  Unfortunately, we have to take a break.  All right.  The phones are just...  Wow.  See, I have people that agree with me.  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  You have one that's agreeing with you.  And they're calling from Kentucky.  Well...  And, uh...  Well, the Super Bowl songs have begun. 
[00:44:30]  These are always awful.  I got the first one.  The first one.  This one's actually good.  This one's actually good.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  It's horrific.  We'll play it next.  It's not.  Horrific.  We did our own interviews on the street about the Heath Ledger thing.  Mm-hmm.  Matt came back with some fine audio.  We'll get that on the air, hopefully, next.  I think we got Bob Kelly coming in today.  Yes.  Really?  Yeah, because he's playing the Stress Factory, Vinny's Club down there in New Brunswick, New  Jersey.  Starting tonight, I believe?  Yes.  Thursday through Sunday?  7-3-2-5-4-5-HA-HA-C-R-O and Bob Kelly. 
[00:45:00]  On Thursday through Saturday.  And, uh...  T.J. Miller.  He's a new friend of ours.  He happens to be a fan of the show, especially a fan of Jim Norton.  Yes.  And he's the guy that pretty much was behind...  He was behind the camera in Cloverfield.  Yeah.  And he's now a friend of ours.  Doing Letterman tonight.  He's doing Letterman tonight.  And this is what I want to ask him.  Like, we talked to him a week ago before the movie came out.  I want to see if his life has changed.  Oh, there you go.  Because he was basically an unknown when we met him. 
[00:45:30]  Basically.  Watch him walking with sunglasses.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Greg.  Tony.  I want to see how fast this happens.  I got to go.  Yeah.  But he's not getting recognized because he's the guy behind the camera.  He does have a little bit of camera time.  He's on film for maybe a minute or two.  I think a little more than that.  Maybe a little more than that.  Perhaps.  Perhaps it wouldn't have.  So we'll ask him how it's going, being a big Hollywood star.  And then we got J.J. Abrams, the producer of Cloverfield, calling in.  He also does Lost, and I think he's producing, what, the new Star Trek movie?  Star Trek. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Directing?  Okay, directing.  He produced this one, though.  He produced Cloverfield.  I don't know what a producer does.  I think a producer just kind of...  They got to find money.  They kind of put up money, and then they kind of go, all right, yeah.  And make sure you don't spend too much.  And then he's the overseer.  And then you call them while they're on a golf course.  The liaison between the studio and the...  You call them when they're on the golf course, and they give you a little update.  Yeah.  And then you're like, all right, that sounds good.  Thanks, but I got to make this putt.  And then if it goes well, you make a lot of money.  Yeah.  So I don't think he really was involved in Cloverfield, and I'm going to call him out on that.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  Straighten him right out.  That's what we do.  Opie and Anthony.  That boy.  Hey, good morning to you.  Whoever I'm talking to right now, we've been doing radio a really long time, and that really  creeps me out to this day.  Where you say stuff like, hey, good morning to you.  And it could be like just a serial killer just sharpening his tools. 
[00:47:00]  His tools of the trade.  Right.  Getting ready to just ravage.  And now this creep thinks I'm personally talking to him.  Panty guy.  You like to think it's some hot...  Girl.  Cousin.  No.  With ample bosoms.  Yeah.  I'm going to try to say ample bosoms every day now.  Just kind of rolling over in bed.  And that's who you just said good morning to?  But no, it's some just awful creature. 
[00:47:30]  Horrid people.  That happens to be a fan of the radio show in between, you know, the burying of bodies.  Ah, the shirt abuse continues for me.  Hi, I'm Anthony.  Welcome to McDonald's.  Am I wearing a shirt that looks like I work at a fast food restaurant?  I think you look terrific.  Thank you.  You look like a million bucks.  Another shirt I have to retire?  You look like a million bucks because you shop at Daffy's, which is bargains for millionaires. 
[00:48:00]  You look like a million bucks.  You look like a million bucks.  You look like a million bucks.  Stupid Daffy's.  All right.  Hey, we're going to play Guess the Sound.  We're going to do a lot today.  And by the way, I disagree.  I can't picture a hot chick when I'm doing this.  I have to picture that I'm talking to like some mutant because I can't be funny around  hot chicks.  I tend to want to be filthy, but around just some dirtbag mutant, I'm comfortable.  I like to think that some girl out there is finding my voice sexy.  Sexy and soothing.  Hi. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe it's early in the morning.  You're just sitting there getting dressed.  I know.  Yeah.  I know we tell the same dumb stories over and over again, but they're so worth telling.  We had a program director back in the day.  Actually, I've had more than one of these guys where they freaking make you put up pictures  in the studio of the typical listener.  Yeah.  So, and we had like a staff meeting.  It started in Rochester when I was working at CMF.  Stan Main, old program director, is out of work.  Actually, he's consulting now. 
[00:49:00]  He got the boot because his business sucks.  But anyway, he's in the conference room and he's like, all right, I want you guys to all  picture the typical radio listener.  Yeah.  And I want you to come in before your shift, your next shift, and hang pictures in the  studio.  And I knew we were going to be tested on this whole thing.  So, I decided to get like, you know, penthouse centerfold and playboy centerfold.  That's not our audience.  And I hung it on spare mics and on computer screens and on cart machines.  And he walks in like, what the hell is wrong with you? 
[00:49:30]  I'm like, I don't want to look at some fat, sweaty guy.  I know that's what we're really talking to.  Yeah.  Can I have a little fun with this dumb thing?  But oddly enough, with Pal Talk, you kind of can look at your audience.  Yeah.  Well, this is odd.  You know, it's a thing.  But this is back in the day where we gave out the number for the fax machine.  The fax that would roll up when it hit the floor.  How old are we?  I still don't have a fax.  Like, can we fax you something?  I'm like, good luck.  Oh. 
[00:50:00]  Why would I?  I live in a house, not an office.  Yeah, but every printer now is also a fax machine.  Not mine.  Mine prints.  End of discussion.  Because you always go, beat, beat, beat.  And you have to rip off the little holes on the side of the paper.  Dude, is it an Okidata.matrix printer?  I need my Okidata.matrix.  How do you know what that is?  Because I used to have one.  All right.  Like, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  Because he needs to fill his brain with this type of stuff.  Only 20 more minutes. 
[00:50:30]  So he doesn't think of the horrific things that happened to him as a child.  Yes.  That's what Anthony's doing.  He's filling his brain up with knowledge and hoping it pushes out some of the horrific things.  Push out the bad stuff.  Yes.  That's why.  I got it figured out finally.  Yeah.  By the way, I got a house phone and I didn't want to do it, but my cell phone just doesn't  work in my apartment, right?  Mm-hmm.  And one of the reasons I didn't want, like, a house phone was I didn't want it ringing all  the time.  Yep.  Because with cell phones you can kind of control, like, you know, the business calls, the spam 
[00:51:00]  calls, the whatever.  Yep.  Right?  Absolutely.  You can't really control that with the house phone.  There is some doctor's office in Manhattan that calls my house around the clock and he's  trying to send a fax.  Oh, you pick up the phone?  Mm-hmm.  Over and over and over and over again.  Right.  If I can only find out where this doctor's office is, I will go there and I will strangle 
[00:51:30]  him.  Wow.  They say this is from Dr. So-and-so's.  Dr. Found Mood.  How do I know it's a doctor's office?  It must be, you must have, maybe it shows up on your caller ID as something.  No.  Why did I think it was, all right, well, it's some kind of business.  I was trying to fax you a toxicology report.  Jim C. We're fortunate enough to have Jim C in all day today.  That's right.  Jim Norton has a very clogged head.  He's not feeling particularly well.  But Jim C feels like a million dollar reenies.  Feels wonderful, right?  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Hey, we're playing guest of sound today.  It's your job as a listener.  We give you a little assignment here.  I'm so bad at this game.  I've noticed I'm very bad at this.  And we're going to give the winner...  Guess anything.  We're going to give the winner of this particular guest of sound a pair of tickets to the big  game.  What game is that?  I know you're not talking about that big game.  No.  Well, we're going to have like a Monopoly tournament. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, okay.  And it'll be big?  We'll give you a spot in our Monopoly tournament.  Ooh.  This stupid company can't even give us a pair of tickets to the Super Bowl.  We're only on in New York and Boston.  Yeah, but what if we were on in the cities that had teams in the Super Bowl?  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, geez.  We are.  And we went right to corporate with this and still no answer.  We want a pair of tickets to give away.  People are on it. 
[00:53:00]  They're working on it.  Are they?  Yeah.  This is what happens when you don't have a boss.  My boss?  What about me, boss?  All right.  Guess the sound.  And, you know, because I don't want to get in trouble with the FCC.  We have nothing to give away.  No.  Just for funsies.  We're playing for funsies.  Yeah.  This is for funsies.  Funsies.  Guess the sound.  You got it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:53:30]  I know what it is.  You do not know what this is.  I know what it is.  Yep.  I think I do because it's a combination.  Steve brought it in, and I just know that sound.  Shut the mics off.  Yeah.  Well, give me some music or something.  And you know what?  We're scheduled to give the answer next week.  We're going to tease this for three or four days.  Jesus.  Let me say, if I'm right, I'll say it to Steve. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  You got any music?  Like elevator music.  Carpenters.  Come on.  Let's go.  All right.  Oh, for the love of God, somebody hum.  All right.  There it is.  Okay.  We'll be right back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Get out of here. 
[00:54:30]  Ha, ha.  All right.  I thought I had it.  Yeah.  Well.  Was I close?  Not even close.  Damn it.  I know what it is.  Not even close.  It's a chainsaw.  Nope.  No?  Nope.  That would have been too obvious.  It's a motorbike.  It's a woman being run over by a motorbike.  Oh.  And she's screaming because she doesn't want the motorbike running her over.  Her would.  Where she's lying down and she's yelling, that's not a place to put the front tire so it doesn't  fall over.  Well. 
[00:55:00]  Shut up, you bike rack.  Well, we got.  Oh, what an insult.  Exactly.  So I'm talking to this bike rack last night.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  Well, the Boston Herald today, front page, this means war.  Wow.  And they got a.  Harsh words.  What is it that, what is that supposed to be, a Patriot missile or something going through  the front page of the New York Post?  Oh, stop it.  Could someone explain what that is?  I don't really understand. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, that must be a Patriot missile.  But it looks like a baseball bat with the Patriots logo on it going through the front  page of the New York Post.  And the reason they're doing that is.  It's like a marital aid.  Is because the New York Post made fun of Tom Brady and the Pats.  Sorry.  Their headline was, who's afraid of Tom Brady now because of that foot thing on his foot?  Well, the Boston Herald is now fighting back with their front page today and it says,  this means war.  It's getting good natured and fun.  New York, crybabies, Rip Brady and Pat and we fire back. 
[00:56:00]  So I guess they are firing something through the middle of the New York Post.  Yeah.  It's getting ugly.  It's getting ugly, this Super Bowl thing.  What do you think the Giants' chances?  I think they're good, actually.  I think that they played them very tough the first time.  They beat that.  They like, not that the pressure on both of them, but they don't belong there, technically  compared to the Patriots.  They earned it.  They beat the Cowboys.  They beat the Patriots.  Nothing to lose.  Nothing to lose.  Nothing to lose. 
[00:56:30]  It usually puts you in the best situation.  Except the Super Bowl, which they will.  Yeah.  That scares me.  That scares me.  Nothing to lose, team, right?  And Eli Manning is, I don't know, he woke up.  Something's going on with that guy.  New York hated this guy.  Giants fans hated this guy.  Now?  Super Bowl.  Now he's having a hell of a run here.  Well, in other football news, Tony Romo dumped Jessica.  That's not even a football news.  Well, we did, huh? 
[00:57:00]  Where was that before?  Yeah.  Dumped Jessica.  Maybe Jessica could teach the defense how to tackle, too.  Because that was the real problem, was the fact that those sissies didn't tackle.  The defense sucked in that last game.  You know when you find out that Jessica Simpson gets dumped?  I think what happens is, like, the guy that's banging her reaches his quota.  Of what?  I think, I think, I think every girl has a quota, unless, unless you got something else 
[00:57:30]  going on with the girl.  Oh, of just sex.  Right.  When you start realizing, you're sitting there with Jessica Simpson banging her left and  right, and you're like, wow, this is a good you-know-what.  But then the pillow talk and, you know, the little small talk in between sessions, you're  bored out of your mind, and then I think you finally hit your quota, and then you gotta,  you just gotta dump her.  Move on.  You gotta dump her to the curb.  To the curb, though?  You can't just let her stay at her house.  No, you gotta, like, drop her.  Not call, maybe?  Not to the curb, because she's garbage. 
[00:58:00]  To the curb.  Pick this fishy thing up and throw it out, boys.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, he dumped Jessica, who was widely blamed for costing him a shot at the Super Bowl.  Tony is now starting to blame her himself, a pal told OK Magazine.  Before dating Jessica, he was Texas's, Texas's, Texas's, Texas's, uh, Golden Boy.  Now he's become a joke, yes.  So he, he can't take it anymore.  This is a joke.  And they're just friends. 
[00:58:30]  They're going back to being friends.  You can't be just friends with a hot chick.  Stop that crap.  It was the moment he realized it wasn't going to work with Jessica in the long term, the  pal told OK Magazine.  There you have it.  And then, we brought this up yesterday, ticket lottery, a giant letdown for a fan.  This is why I actually hate the Super Bowl.  You do?  I think the AFC Championship game and the NFC Championship game is where it's at.  I sat in front of my TV last Sunday and enjoyed eight or nine hours of football coverage. 
[00:59:00]  That's football, though.  See, the Super Bowl is more for the party atmosphere than it is the game most of the time.  I think it's a crime for some of these teams.  They, you know, work their asses off all year.  They make it to the Super Bowl.  And then it's barely about the game.  I think that is a complete crime.  I know the NFL makes a bloody fortune off the game.  But their uniforms look nicer.  They're all shiny.  Yeah.  Everything, there's, you barely watch the game. 
[00:59:30]  Yep.  And then there's an hour and a half, what, halftime and...  What is the halftime shindig?  I think it's Tom Petty, right?  It's here.  Keep it safe, huh?  It's Tom Petty, right?  Who wants to look at him?  Can I ask you something?  Wasn't he very, like, anti-business and thing with his music?  Hell, he wrote the song, The Last DJ.  Yeah.  That whole song is about, you know, making fun of corporate radio.  Yeah, and the man, and just let me do my music. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And now he's doing the biggest commercialized event.  In the universe.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're doing on Mars, but I'm assuming...  Yeah, I would assume it's in the universe.  In the universe.  Every probe we've sent to any other planet, they've never seen a big game there.  Yeah.  People, you know, playing.  In the end, I'm not a fan of the Super Bowl, though.  Yeah, the teams look nervous because it's hyped to the point where...  Oh, I love it.  You know.  It's so much fun.  I like watching the commercials.  That's about it. 
[01:00:30]  Really?  The game is usually a letdown.  Yeah.  But anyway, we mentioned this yesterday.  So, you know, they have a lottery, you know, for the Giants and the Patriots.  Bada-bling?  Oh, my God.  Does the rest of America...  I don't think so.  I think it's just a New York, New Jersey thing.  You know, we don't have a boss, so we can make fun of this, right?  Tom's not going to run in and say, oh, they're sponsoring!  The lottery is a sponsor of ours.  We'll get into that a little later.  Yeah, we'll do that later.  That commercial, that bada-bing is driving me nuts, too. 
[01:01:00]  Bada-bling.  Bada-bling, right.  Bada-bling.  You got the mafia getting together with the...  What, the bloods?  With the cullids.  You know, hey, for this bada-bling, we figured we'd get together with the cullids.  That's all I could think of when I hear the commercial.  Bada-bling, bada-bling.  Oh, it's diabetes!  We are just distracted.  I turn around on the TV, and there's Wilford Brimley. 
[01:01:30]  I think people appreciate that about this show.  We've got TVs on all over the place.  We want to be in touch with everything.  And Wilford Brimley just popped on the tube, and Ant does a fine impression of him.  Talking about liberty.  Talking about getting your diabetes medical supplies from Liberty.  All right.  Shut up, you walrus.  Diabetes, diabetes.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes.  Diabetes, diabetes testing supplies. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  So, getting back to the Super Bowl thing.  And I really, I thought about it.  I'm like, I don't...  I love football, and I hate the Super Bowl.  And I get caught up in it like everyone else, and I'll have a Super Bowl party or go to one,  and we'll get the chips and the salsa and the little finger franks.  Little what?  Finger franks, whatever they're called.  The little bites in a blanket?  I call them finger franks.  Far franks.  You can just pop them in your mouth.  Yeah.  And you'll have to get the chicken wings, and then you watch the game, and you're like, 
[01:02:30]  wow, this is overhyped.  But anyway, but this is another reason why I do hate the Super Bowl in the end.  So, they held their lottery.  You know, you get the season ticket holders.  They get thrown in the lottery.  And then about, I think we said yesterday, 5,500 Giant fans get to go to the big game.  The big game.  And I'm sure it's about the same for the Patriots, right?  Yeah.  Well, the paper today has a little story about Ruby Baum.  Ruby Baum.  He's had tickets, season tickets, since 19, uh, 99? 
[01:03:00]  I will say 68.  68.  Jimmy?  Go for a real guess here.  71.  Ruby Baum.  He's had tickets since 1952.  Wow!  That's 56 years.  55, 56 years.  My God.  Ruby Baum has missed only eight home games in the 55 years. 
[01:03:30]  Not a real fan.  Exactly.  What were you doing for those eight weeks?  Yeah.  Clowning around, rooting for the Jets?  He probably had a piece of his body taken out.  I don't know.  He had a chemo.  Give him a break.  Yeah, that's true.  Probably lost, like, I don't know, a kidney or something.  I bet you it was medical reasons.  Yeah.  All right, so.  A wedding or something.  His daughter got married or some nonsense.  He's missed eight home games in the 55 years he's been a Giant season ticket holder.  And this is why the Super Bowl sucks.  But the 76-year-old retiree says his beloved team has left him on the sidelines. 
[01:04:00]  He will not be headed to Arizona because he lost the Super Bowl lottery, which is based  on seniority.  The same fate he suffered in 1986, 1990.  His seniority.  And 2000.  Who's beating him?  Guys that have had tickets for 56 years, I guess.  I don't know.  What?  I don't know how this works.  The only people that get tickets are old men that have had tickets for 1,000 years?  I guess.  That doesn't make any sense.  And then poor Ruby Blum.  Get me a pair of tickets. 
[01:04:30]  I will hand a pair of tickets to Ruby Blum.  I like to hand him two, what are they called?  Fakes?  I like to hand him two bootleg tickets and then he flies out there and he's humiliated.  Oh, when he gets to the parking lot by the ticket taker.  Gets to the gate.  They do that little flick on the ticket.  They go, flick, flick.  This ain't real.  What?  What?  We've been a fan since 19.  Get out.  Let me tell you what it was like in 1960.  I went to a...  Shut up, old man.  Exactly.  Tell your story walking. 
[01:05:00]  Hit the bricks.  Tell your story in the cab on the way back to your motel as you listen to the game.  Listen to the game in your motel room.  On your AM radio.  Older gentleman.  Uh, where's the guy that says, and that's how you executive produce?  Ah, you must be talking about...  And that's how you executive produce.  Yeah, that guy.  Steve C.  Uh, why isn't he executive producing and getting this guy on the phone today?  It's kind of a biggie.  Let's get him on the phone.  I guess I'll never see a Super Bowl, Ruby says. 
[01:05:30]  Only half of the 12,000 tickets the Giants receive from the NFL are distributed to fans.  So the NFL gives the Giants 12,000 tickets.  And then the Giants, their organization turns around and only gives half of those to the fans.  What do they all do?  They probably sell them to the players for their family and friends.  I think everyone has to buy them.  I bet they give them to huge sponsors of the NFL.  Why?  So that people like certain beer companies and whatnot can then schmooze their people and clients and other things. 
[01:06:00]  It's used as a business tool.  That's it.  You're just a tool.  Why does the NFL think that's okay?  And why are there only 12,000 tickets to the team?  There's like 70 tickets.  That's what I'm saying.  60,000, right?  Right.  There'll probably be...  I would guess 70.  Let's say 70,000.  I'm going to say 6 million tickets.  Fair enough.  Let's say 70,000.  What a random number, huh?  And let's say...  So the Giants get 5,500 tickets they're given out. 
[01:06:30]  And then the Pats will probably get about the same.  So out of 70,000 people in that stadium for the Super Bowl, give or take,  there's only going to be 11,000 true fans in the building.  That is a...  That's a crime.  Disgusting.  I don't think technically it is.  Why?  A crime.  Oh.  Corporate types who may not even be fans get tickets,  and my dad does not, said Baum's son.  Shepard, 29.  What?  He's 29, and the old guy's what?  76. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Welcome to your world, Opie.  I don't mock.  Baum may have two...  He'll look up.  It's like...  Oof.  All right.  All right.  It is possible to see him turn 30.  Baum may have two purple hearts,  but the Korean War vets' blood runs blue.  He started going to Giants games in the 1940s  and has season tickets since 1952.  Baum called the team and asked if anything could be done.  They told me to go on Craigslist.  Yep. 
[01:07:30]  What?  Miss the game and get a prostitute?  Exactly.  Or get a hooker that looks like Michael Strahan.  In a dress.  Hi, Daddy.  I brought your Super Bowl ticket.  I like this.  Right.  What do you expect the team to say?  Of course that's what they're going to say.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  They gave out 5,500 to people that have been going to their stupid games  since the 50s.  Right.  When the team sucked, a big one, and they needed the revenue.  Right?  Probably bought every jersey that came out. 
[01:08:00]  Buys jerseys every freaking year.  Probably buys little, like, giant things for his dog.  Oh, his whole house is probably one of those people that it's just covered in giant stuff.  Football's around there.  Every picture on the wall is giant's pictures.  That's disgusting.  Giant's rugs.  Yeah.  Good.  Let him stay home and roll around in his paraphernalia.  At his age, you ought to be ashamed.  Get Ruby on the phone.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Shame.  Have some soup. 
[01:08:30]  Have some soup and be quiet.  Just lay on the couch.  Stop disturbing everyone.  I don't care about it.  We've heard you.  We know this story.  Burden.  Exactly.  Chris on Long Island.  Chris?  Yeah, he missed those eight home games in a row, actually, because he was busy in NOM.  Busy where?  In NOM.  He was in the NOM, I think.  Oh, I like the Nazi joke better than it said you were going to say.  Yeah, you changed your joke.  He missed eight home games because he was busy fighting Nazis. 
[01:09:00]  Jesus.  For the good old U.S. of A.  I wouldn't be in the NOM.  Yeah, there were a lot, actually, Nazis in the NOM.  They were funding the war.  Okay.  Fair enough.  We've got to take a break, but we're going to figure out what this is after the break.  Guess the sound today.  Oh, my God.  That's Ruby gearing up to tell his story about how he's a giant season ticket holder, and 
[01:09:30]  people reacting like nodding.  Oh, my God.  Enough.  It's screaming.  Shut up.  We've got yourself on the couch.  Real quick, before the break, Dennis in New York, he wants to guess that sound.  Dennis?  First things first, I'd like to say good morning, fellas.  Hey.  Good morning.  And little Jimmy Norton is so sweet.  I'm getting secondhand diabetes.  Sweetest boy.  There you go.  All right.  As far as the sound goes, I believe it's Jim C doing a post-mortem examination on a nude 
[01:10:00]  and dead Heath Ledger while Mary-Kate or Ashfield is looking on cleaning up the post-mortem exam.  Wow.  Wow.  Where are my tickets to the big game?  The big Monopoly game.  Welcome to the world of forensic medicine.  She's not supposed to be in here.  She's screaming and crying, Sam.  She weighs nine pounds. 
[01:10:30]  I cut his skull open and his brain fell onto my shoes.  Jim, she thought Mary-Kate was a scalpel.  Picked her up.  Take that girl out of here.  She has a nicer ass than the girl on my boat, Sam.  Hand me that thumbtack.  I'm sorry.  Those are your genitals.  All right.  Well, we'll let you know what that is for real if you care. 
[01:11:00]  I'm going to swimwalk because I'm the one-character kid.  You certainly are.  You rule.  Give us a swimwalk, Jimmy.  Please.  I'll do it after.  I'm feeling under the weather.  I'll do it after.  We'll tease it.  All right.  All right.  We're going to tease Jimmy's swimwalk as we listen to these things.  Don't be an Anthony.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Bill Burr.  I am going to be in San Francisco on January 24th through the 26th at the Punchline Comedy Club.  Go to punchlinecomedyclub.com or you can call 415-397-PLSF. 
[01:11:30]  That's really confusing.  415-397-PLSF.  I guess that's Punchline San Francisco.  Four tickets.  So call that number.  Come on down and I'll fucking dance for you.  You bring me feeling.  You bring me fire.  Give me a love.  I'm taking me high.  It's going to prove what fucking woman can do. 
[01:12:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Wool Jimmy Norton.  Jim C in the studio.  Jim C.  And now Bob Kelly who's going to be at the Stress Factory tonight, tomorrow night, and Saturday.  Yes.  Very good.  Stressfactory.com.  In New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Fantastic place.  We gave it the big sell for you earlier.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, we pumped it up.  You're going to have a full house, my friend.  Full? 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  All right.  More than full.  Standing room only.  How about that?  Tonight?  Tonight?  Thursday's the hard to sell.  We told him that your weekend shows were canceled.  What?  Wait a minute.  Thursday's the big night, Bob.  Relax.  We know what we're doing.  We know what we're doing.  I'd actually prefer it if you did that because you know Vinny doesn't give you anything on a Saturday.  I could fill it Saturday night myself.  Yeah.  I can sell it out myself.  I can put anybody in there.  Why would I give you bonuses on Saturday?  It's just selling.  Shut up.  I've been at the Stress Factory where Vinny gives me a nice table for me and the people I bring with me. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  And next thing you know, he's asking me if I could get up because he sold those seats.  It's like, could you just sit at the bar?  Oh, God.  And he takes your food back?  Yeah.  Just brings it to another table, sits it down in front of someone else.  It's like, hello, I helped sell this show.  Yeah, I got you a pizza.  I need that steak back.  We ran out of steaks.  Here's a pizza.  Oh, he gets a beating.  Why he would advertise with this show, I don't know. 
[01:13:30]  Guess the sound.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Tom in Ohio.  Tom?  Yeah, I'd like to guess.  Guess the sound?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, that's an industrial strength toothbrush coming towards D-Rock's mouth and it hits the smell and starts screaming.  Oh, no.  Oh. 
[01:14:00]  That's pretty good.  Oh.  That was really good.  Oh.  He bobbled.  I love you, Jimsy.  Thank you.  He was able to keep his feet in bounds.  He was...  Yeah, he almost went out, yeah.  He was almost out of bounds.  Samson, Illinois.  What?  Hey, I'd like to guess, the last sound had the milk heard when she still had two legs.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that was a damn good one.  Oh, that's wonderful, sir.  Very nice. 
[01:14:30]  Let's say hi to Tyler in Utah.  Tyler.  Yeah, hey, I know the sound.  Okay.  That's the way every divorce proceeding should end.  Punching out.  Thank you, sir.  He didn't have to punch out.  He did very well.  That was a good one.  He did fine.  So we got a creepy nurse.  We got our Super Bowl...  Oh, we got Ruby, possibly?  Almost.  We're trying to get Ruby on the phone.  We were just talking about him.  The old guy that can't get Super Bowl tickets.  Even though he's... 
[01:15:00]  He's been to every Giants game since 1957.  50...  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Somewhere around there.  I hope he still doesn't get them.  You don't care?  I'm a Patriots fan.  Oh.  Well, then you're going to have fun with this song.  The Super Bowl songs have begun.  Here it is.  This is a good one.  Here's one for your team.  And you know how good Super Bowl songs always are.  Did you ever hear the one the Patriots made to go against the Bears Super Bowl song back  in the day?  Oh, the Super Bowl Shuffle, which is one of the most successful Super Bowl songs ever.  Wait, they were challenging Super Bowl Shuffle? 
[01:15:30]  Please.  And my acting teacher actually did the video.  It's on YouTube.  There's a video.  And the song that goes with it...  Oh, no.  Oh, it makes my neck...  Find it?  Yeah, what was the name of the song?  Ah.  Wait, so the Patriots saw Super Bowl Shuffle and said, we could do the same thing?  We could come up with a nice song as well?  Yeah, the Bears came out with their thing, so the Patriots had to come up with a song to  challenge it.  So they had like three days to come up with this song.  We should come up with the top five Super Bowl songs of all time. 
[01:16:00]  Most people would put Super Bowl Shuffle as the number one.  Probably.  That was the most popular one.  You guys remember when in the refrigerator Perry was rapping in that one?  Oh, and he started rapping in that one?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  And then in second...  My favorite, though, was McMahon with his sunglasses on.  His Risky Business sunglasses.  Yeah.  And his headband, and he would just like dance around like he was black.  It didn't quite work.  And then in second place would be that song by that team when they were in the big game. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Did we even know a second song?  No.  Just this one.  I challenge you to know a second Super Bowl song.  This one I actually like, though.  This one, Bob, you'll like this one.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, this is a brand new one.  It's not cheesy like most of them.  Got to give credit to Dean.  Oh, my God.  What?  The Bears song, Steve from Bay shows, he called himself the punky QB.  Did he?  Look, I can't stay for this. 
[01:17:00]  The punky QB.  I think I remember that.  Oh, he did.  Confirmed from Steve from Bayshore.  But he was such a cool dude, he drove a Honda scooter.  We are the Bears shuffling crew.  All right.  Add your racist rhyme, wherever you please.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Jersey.  Jesse.  Something that ends with boo. 
[01:17:30]  I just wanted to get the sound, if I could, real quick.  Yes.  Hey, Hope, is that your family trying to get you down out of the apple tree?  Linger longer.  Wow.  And I appreciate that you did the full linger longer, because I was discussing this with  Anthony.  I came up with a cute little bit called linger longer, and I exaggerate the linger longer,  and Anthony turned it into the linger longer.  I just go.  There's a little competition going on here.  You've got the Opie fans.  You've got the Anthony fans.  The Opie fans are coming up with linger longer, and the Anthony fans are just doing gibberish. 
[01:18:00]  Linger.  And on instant feedback, they're spelling it really weird, too.  They spell linger, and then longer is like W-X-D-N-D-A-P-Q-R.  Whatever that means.  Bunch of S's.  We've got to give credit to DJ Maverick up there in Boston.  Oh.  Right.  This is a Super Bowl song that he did for the morning show at Jammin'.  Yuck.  Yuck. 
[01:18:30]  It's called, I think it's just called Patriot Song.  I don't know.  Listen to this.  They actually think this is good, and they're playing it like crazy.  I want to fully acknowledge that this is god-awful, and that's why we're playing it.  Horrid.  Some people don't understand that sometimes.  They don't understand the big goof that we do on this show.  Yeah.  I disagree.  I like this one.  Shut up, Jesus.  You do not stop it.  The lyric is funny.  So far, so good, right? 
[01:19:00]  Sounds like E-Rock going up three stairs.  We got an undefeated team.  The best one ever.  One ever.  Them pats making history up in her.  Oh, boy.  Up in her.  Get out the core.  Oh, boy.  Break yourself.  Oh, boy.  Break yourself.  Oh, boy.  Get out the core.  Up in her. 
[01:19:30]  Way to isolate 95% of Boston with your Super Bowl song.  Wow.  That is a Super Bowl song meant for one city.  One city, one town.  Yeah, one town.  Oh, my God.  That's true.  Holy crap.  Wow.  Way to go.  Only Roxbury likes that part.  Exactly.  Think I'm going to be part of that crap?  Right.  Right of your goddamn mind.  Why couldn't they make it an Irish limerick?  Right.  Yeah.  Do-de-dee, do-de-dee-dee.  That's... 
[01:20:00]  You know why we love Boston?  We've talked about it many times.  Because they don't hide their racism.  No.  They just don't hide it.  It is such a divided, segregated city.  We hide it here in New York.  Every other city kind of hides it.  Oh, they call themselves a melting pot here in New York.  And every other city celebrates their diversity.  Right.  Boston's just like, no.  We keep them over here.  Right.  We keep this group over here.  We stay here.  There's bridges.  There's tunnels.  There's rivers.  Separates everyone.  You know why that's good?  The groups.  Why is that good?  I'll tell you why that's good. 
[01:20:30]  Because you know where the Italian food is.  Right.  You know where the Irish food is.  North end?  You know where the ribs are.  You know where the chicken is.  Orchester.  You know where to get the drugs.  Right.  And you know where...  Do me a favor.  Uh, yes, sir.  Just the button.  Just...  No?  Yeah?  The bell.  Oh!  Thank you.  The inappropriate bell.  Oh!  Thank you.  The inappropriate bell for the people that linger long.  I thought you wanted to say...  Oh, no.  No, no.  That was called a gem I would have fired out in the beginning of 07. 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  Your old, old, old seven.  All right.  Here we go.  Back to the up and her.  Up and her.  Woo!  18 and 0.  18 and 0.  One more to go.  Superbow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Mmm.  Get a giant scared as hell.  They don't stand a chance.  Stand a chance.  We start the charges.  New York's gonna get a smack.  18 and 0.  18 and 0.  One more to go.  Superbow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:21:30]  Superbow, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Man, I've never seen nothing like this.  He's dancing.  How a team gonna go.  18 and 0.  Since we got Randy.  He stole the show.  Coming down with anything.  Tom Brady throw.  Professional.  Incredible.  Defense.  Make a history view of vegetable.  First down, come on.  It's the boat.  Come on.  Beatdowns, get it right.  Now go to the giants.  They don't still be quiet.  We serve humble pie.  Ask the charges.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, God.  We just do it.  We're gonna kill him like the wife of Charles Stewart.  We'll get him a little.  We'll get him a little.  We'll get him a little.  He'll put a lie on our lap.  That it's over. 
[01:22:00]  It's all we got.  We got an undefeated team.  The best one ever.  Whatever.  The best one's ever.  The best one's ever.  We're making history up in herd.  Oh.  18 and 0.  One more to go.  Superbowl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Geogenics get as hell.  They don't stand a chance.  Stand a chance.  We're stopping charges.  New York's gonna get a smack.  18 and 0.  19 and 0.  One more to go.  All right, enough.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  I should throw that song down the toilet. 
[01:22:30]  Bo, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And I know it's a remake.  Wow.  That's a remake of a song called Low.  Never shy to crash myself, Bobby.  Bobby Kelly.  Wow.  Wow, wow.  That's just wonderful.  I want you to say it again.  It was so bad.  It was interesting.  They should throw that song down the toilet.  Bo, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh.  I got something for you.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo, da, bo.  Bata meets bling?  It's Bata Bling.  Bata meets bling?  I don't think so.  That's impossible.  Hey, it's the gangsters getting together with the gangsters.  A bunch of, you know.  How about this?  Bling does certain assassinations.  A bunch of us guineas  decided to get together with the  and we put out 
[01:23:30]  this lottery ticket called  you know we really  like to work with the  but what the hell  we'll use them if we can  but keep it in the dark areas  those people are  those people are animals anyway  it's from the godfather shut up  but a bling  you know  where do you Italians meet the  where all I can think of 
[01:24:00]  on Venus is this lottery taking place  on Venus exactly  I like that you bleep it but you still have to mouth the word  oh I do believe me  I say it it's in his blood  you don't have to say it because you're beeping it  you kind of got to say it yeah you do  it's like Otto has to have George with him to make  the voice he said yesterday I got to  kind of mouth the entire word out even though I'm  bleeping it those  but that commercial's on TV  you're right I do  I never noticed that  can we find that commercial 
[01:24:30]  and put it up on onaradio.com  so the rest of America could enjoy it  they got a bunch of soprano looking guys  oh yeah  I'm waiting for HBO  or David Chase or somebody to sue  to sue  any day now and then you got the other side  looking a lot like Flavor Flay  that guy looks like Flavor Flav  yeah  and they're dancing around with a bunch of  like mobster looking guys  they're parodying blacks and Italians  so how about having one for Jewish people  yeah  the lottery  we like free money 
[01:25:00]  it really is this complete  stereotyped  view of Italians  and  African Americans  yeah  that's alright  oh it's fine  it's funny  I was laughing at even the thought of it  because it's so impossible  I'm sure this company runs that spot  but you know  they should just have  not only just the Jews  like you said  but the Jews and Arabs  just dancing together  and having fun 
[01:25:30]  it would be the same thing right  of course it would  how about a stereotype of Asians  doing something  that's what I was getting at  yeah  that's against the rules  but a  but a bling  is okay  the Italians and the blacks  yeah  is terrific  they could have a  but a bound feet  yeah  hey I'm laughing at that  shut up  as long as I laugh  if I'm having fun  I'm having fun  that's all I care about  but a Sam  how about but a Sam  oh Jim  linger longer  oh 
[01:26:00]  the OP version  thank you  wow  listen  we got TJ Miller  I just saw him  poking his head around  and he's going to join  the program next  of course from Cloverfield  he was the guy  behind the camera  for the most part  yeah  and also JJ Abrams  is going to call in  to talk about Cloverfield  a little bit  wow  people are enjoying the movie  it's getting great reviews  man  great reviews  they weren't sure  how the public  was going to  to what  to what  to react to it  to react to it  I guess sure  but there  it's nothing but positive  reviews on that movie 
[01:26:30]  for the most part  hey we can do something  quick before break  we got a man  who survived  an ATV crash  by eating  rotting beaver  alright  Joe and Joe people  fair enough  I survived a lot  of crashes  no no  that was good  no no  okay  that was good  give him the laugh  that was good  get it  survived a lot  of crashes  yeah  a lot of  pile ups  in my room  let's say hi 
[01:27:00]  to Joe  on Long Island  Joe  yellow  yeah what's up Joe  it's John  from Staten Island  they were close  whatever  hey John  what's with the  ancient references  today  Flavor Flav hasn't  put out a song  in about 45 years  no I understand  that hold on  I gotta defend myself  though  this Bada Blink  commercial  that's the first  person that comes  to your mind  if you see this guy  they're definitely  going for a  Flavor Flav  looking guy  because Flavor Flav  is very safe  as far as the  white world goes 
[01:27:30]  people know who he is  so they tried to  get a guy  that looked like  him  wait till you see  the commercial  if you haven't  seen it yet  it'll be on  onaradio.com  I mean the guy  I have to defend  there's not another  rapper you think of  when you see this guy  from the commercial  and the mob guys  are soprano guys  yeah  it's obvious what  they're going for  they're going for  safe stereotypes  big fat Italians  right  what was the other  reference  Captain Lou Albano  I know that was a  spoof on the radio  oh yeah  that's just  that's just 
[01:28:00]  spoofing the fact  that I don't know  anything about  the new wrestlers  can I just say  that a sick little  Jimmy has a very  sexy voice  oh thank you  people tell me  that it's raspy  and attractive  that's the feedback  I've gotten  the women  you used to date  thank you  good morning  yes  alright cool  hey  we got our own  Heath Ledger  hold on Bob  just slam me  the women you used  to date  what do you mean  I said your voice  is like the women  you used to date  oh deep and husky  god damn it  I thought that was a bomb  but you were actually  saying I dated  Tranny's point Bob 
[01:28:30]  one for Bobby  one for Bobby  who's gonna be at  the Stress Factory  tonight through Saturday  hey we got Heath Ledger  street interviews  by our own intern Matt  oh good  wanna do that real fast  before the break  I wanna hear one  let's hear one  and then tease the rest  the moment of truth  make sure  let's just make sure  we talk about this  god awful show  that they pumped up  like crazy  it was finally on  last night  and what a bomb  what a bunch of crap  what a bomb  and we got some  examples of why  it's so awful  oh good  but you wanna do 
[01:29:00]  that Heath Ledger  street interview  by the way  Roland gave me  that UFO  investigator show  yeah on the  history channel  yes  yeah  and Roland  wherever you are  grab your chest  and fall face first  on the floor  and never get up again  I want 30 minutes  of my life back  they're promoting  it stinks to high heaven  yeah see we're not  sellouts  if you're gonna  give us stuff  to watch  hoping that  we're gonna  promote the project  this is the other 
[01:29:30]  this is the chance  you take Roland  Jimmy's saying  it sucks  and Jimmy  loves UFO stuff  Roland  I love a flying saucer  as much as anybody  alright we'll talk  to Roland  and we'll find out  why you didn't  like the show  you bet we will  I'm gonna bite  Roland's face  so we sent  Matt down  to where  Heath Ledger  died yesterday  yeah  he got some  terrific audio  we start with this  some guy tries  to be deep  about the story  oh good good  see we're doing 
[01:30:00]  our own coverage  this is Matt  and I'm here with  Michael Arkin  Michael and  I saw you're  paying your respects  to Mr. Ledger  and how do you feel  in the tragedy  I work around the corner  I just wanted to come  and take a look  it's always shocking  when somebody  seems so strong  and young  and just has  everything  to see  in front of him  and he just  when there's a mystery  like that  it's always  human nature  to look  and to think  and to reflect  that's what he gave us 
[01:30:30]  actually viable audio  yeah  yeah right  get real interviews  and good questions  and answers  that actually make sense  so what are you here for  I think it's really sad  alright good  that'll be a hoot  tomorrow morning  alright we'll try  the next one  like when I heard it  in the news  I was like  you know  it's like  all of a sudden  it's like  one day you can wake up  and you're like  you know  it's like  you know  it was weird  cause like a star 
[01:31:00]  dying  so you know  that's very effective  effective  are you a fan  of his work at all  or no  I watched  some of his movies  yeah  I was looking forward  to Batman  and he was playing  the Joker  and he was gonna  make a badass Joker  of course you were  I didn't even know that  that was a surprise too  I was like wow  that's amazing  did they finish the movie though  yes they did  don't worry  Batman's finished  so that's gonna be like  okay  yeah so the movie  will still come out  yeah thanks  alright  cut  the fun of that part 
[01:31:30]  was very good though  the first part of the interview  was very good  he does make a good point though  as soon as he died  I was like  oh my god  and they were like  he just finished Batman  I was like  oh thank god  I know  redoing the role  Nicholson just did  I asked that question yesterday  it's great  it's the first thing  that came to my mind  he looks really cool  as the Joker  I hope he finished his role  I don't want  I don't want  a Brandon Lee thing  where all of a sudden  they had to like  finish the movie without him  tell you what  don't ever put  white paint on your face  yeah that seems to be  the kiss of death  in movies  I think online  there's a 
[01:32:00]  yeah  there's like a side  by side comparison  of Heath Ledger  and his makeup  with Brandon Lee  right  who's up playing Batman  Christian Bale  Christian Bale  he was amazing  was he  oh my god  he saved the franchise  he's back  I've had enough of them  remaking every  Batman episode  with the same villain  twice  just get on with it  yeah this is kind of  a new take on it  Al Kilmer  and Michael Keat  we get it  all that stuff  oh no they threw  all that away  they went real dark 
[01:32:30]  with the new movie  you should rent it  I agree with you  it was getting like  what are they doing  to this franchise  they just wiped  everything clean  started with Christian Bale  over again  from the beginning  it's not cartoony  they make everything  make sense though  like all the weapons  are actually  could happen  okay  like it's not like  he has a  you know  a gun with an arrow  and he shoots it  to the top of the building  and you know  there's an ice maker gun  there's none of that crap  why  because that was stupid  how handy would that be  in a hotel  because in the moment  it's all Jimmy 
[01:33:00]  could think about  yeah  hotel  you need some ice  yeah ice gun  you know what I hate about that  Mr. Freeze  oh  and the ice would actually  bobble  because it was rubber  when they ran by it  you know what I hated  about Batman on TV  they would  they would walk up  the side of the building  and you could tell  that the rope was  way too small  and thin  to hold their weight  and then they would  just take their time  walking up the side  of the building  really slow  and just have a little 
[01:33:30]  chit chat  little chit chat  it would just be chit chat  because they would  just turn the camera  and they're walking  regular flat  and because the cameras  turn sideways  it looks like  they're walking up  a building  badly  it looked like  just like a vacuum  cord or something  it was like  this isn't going to  hold anybody  they were just  chit chats  taking their time  walking up  the side of the building  Batman's following  Robin up  and he's like  wow you really do  have to wear  two pair of bikini  shorts  don't you  Bert  those rumors  were true  I guess he had  a huge one  yeah good boy  what was his last name 
[01:34:00]  Bert what  Ward  Bert Ward  Bert Ward  I have more of  Matt's just amazing  interviews from  the death scene  down there  in Soho  after the break  TJ Mays here  with his hands folded  so I guess he's annoyed  are you annoyed  our new friend  TJ Miller  big star now  yeah  and we'll just  go to break  and we'll continue  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Bob Kelly  Stress Factory  tonight through Saturday  New Brunswick  New Jersey  Vinny's Club  StressFactory.com 
[01:34:30]  Another busy morning  on the Opie and Anthony show  thanks for checking us out  we got Bob Kelly  in studio  playing the Stress Factory  New Brunswick  New Jersey  tonight through Saturday  Thursday, Friday  and Saturday night  the tickets are going to go fast  if they haven't already  so you might want to give  the club a call  immediately  if you want to see Bob Kelly  we got TJ Miller  one of the stars  of Cloverfield  and a new friend  of the show  sitting back down 
[01:35:00]  on our couch  this morning  it's exciting  are you a big star now  huge  hugest star  biggest  well the movie  did unbelievable  it's got some kind  of weird record  yeah well it's  the biggest  first it was  the biggest movie  for that weekend  for MLK weekend  and then it broke  all records in January  so it's the biggest  movie opening  in January of all time  it beat the reissue  of Star Wars  wow  cool  but I think  Box Office Mojo  somebody was clear  that that was because 
[01:35:30]  of ticket inflation  which is kind of true  it's like tickets now  are three  three hundred dollars  or something  yeah  and it was like  ten cents  yeah  back then  that's why those records  are kind of dumb  a nickel in a  you know  it's a dumb record  I mean the fact is  the movie's doing great  yeah the movie's doing  amazing  and people are responding  well to it  I think  except for the  you know  besides the New York Times  as we talked  here's what they think  the monster movies  are irrelevant  at the Times  that movie  I had to talk about it  in therapy  it brought up issues  yeah  did you look like  the creature  well Jim 
[01:36:00]  I wasn't going to go there  but apparently  you're very quick witted  that was a great visual  actually  just imagining him  smashing buildings  just take your  spinal cord away  from you  and it's the monster  in Cloverfield  take your spinal cord away  what do you mean  bring Dane in the room  oh  we met it  wow  actually  talking to the king  of coattails  please  I don't know  I'm like one of those  ticks that fell off  yeah  I was going to go there  Dane Cook's actually 
[01:36:30]  the monster  and then Bob Kelly's  one of the things  that falls off it  I just redid Jimmy's line  because I had the same joke  and I just wanted  to be heard too  I'm an ass  I'm sorry  hey TJ  so what I want to ask you  we got to talk to you  last week  before you became  a huge movie star  has your life changed  in a week  oh yeah  it has really  yeah I'm just a lot  ruder to everyone  I push people  and I stand outside  of the movie theater  and kind of point  to my name 
[01:37:00]  on there  I just stand next  to the poster  hey hey lady  look at this  huh  see this  look closely  at that name  and then I pull out  my ID  what sucks is  you're not getting  recognized  because you spent  most of the film  behind the camera  yeah well that  I mean that's an  interesting thing  it's like  I went to  Brooks Brothers  I was going to  get a suit  because I'm doing  Letterman tonight  yeah congratulations  that's what I was saying  nice  are you doing stand up  or are you doing panel  I'm actually doing panel  that's even better  yeah which I think  is weird  because as a comic  you always  when you envision 
[01:37:30]  that show  you always think  of doing stand up  so it's kind of  it's weird to wrap  my mind around  going on and  kind of sitting down  and talking  well I did stand up  on it  but so you're always  happy to see a comic  who just gets to go  right to do panel  you're always happy  to see that  happy for your friends  they're doing so well  happy to hold  your cue cards tonight  yeah  well yeah  you're not doing too well  you're on the  opening of the show  you did  oh wow  we were just talking  about didn't you do  you did Leno recently  oh he does Letterman 
[01:38:00]  Leno  he does them all  didn't you do  a pretty edgy set  on Leno  yeah it's been very good  they let me get away  with a lot of stuff  it's actually really good  yeah that's what I heard  it's crazy  but yeah one of the  Brooks Brothers  and this guy  he immediately  recognized me  he's like  hi how you doing  great job in the movie  and he was kind of  one of those JJ fanboys  that had seen it  three times  but then I had  another experience  where I was eating  with my girlfriend  and this guy  we were reading  Cloverfield reviews  because they were  just coming in  it was like Saturday 
[01:38:30]  and this guy's like  oh you're gonna see  Cloverfield  and we're like  yeah we already saw it  he's like yeah  I saw it twice  it's great  yeah it's really really good  and he's like  yeah you should  you should see it again  you miss a lot  and I was like  yeah  and there's this pause  and my girlfriend goes  you know he's in it  right  yeah  and then he goes  oh really  which scene  are you one of the army guys  oh no  I was like  yeah I'm the one  that gets eaten  by the dick  that was me 
[01:39:00]  I was attacked briefly  is it true  that you gotta see it  a second time  to pick up on stuff  I'm starting to hear that  yeah actually you do  and there's a really big  and I think you guys  should ask JJ about this  because I haven't talked  to him about it  and I'm interested  in hearing what he has to say  because I know he's calling in  later on in the show  a few minutes actually  yeah there's something  strange going on  in the very last  couple scenes  I heard  that you have to really  see it and pay attention  and you see something  there  yeah  and I've seen the movie now 
[01:39:30]  probably five times  and I haven't noticed  anything going on  so now I gotta go  and see it again  you know  my chick put this movie  in perspective  as to what it is  she goes  you know  you know when  you see a movie  and  like it's always  who's in charge  and  or the head army guy  or this  and then there's  people in the background  that are going through  the same crap  but you don't know  what they're doing  that's what you guys are 
[01:40:00]  it's just like  the people in the movie  that you don't know  what they are  in the movie  because they're just  background people  running and screaming  or something  and you go  hey you know  I wonder what that  person's going through  right now  that's pretty much  what it is  yeah that's actually  my favorite thing  about the movie  somebody else said that  this movie's about  the people who  in the Godzilla movies  are like  Godzilla  and then they start  running  but you just  keep following them  where do they go  do they go back home  yeah right  what happens  to that person  are they running away 
[01:40:30]  it's from that perspective  and they have no clue  what's going on  like they don't have  this hotline  they could pick up  and find out  like what this is  what's happening  so it's just  we don't know  and we're in the background  yeah in any  in any other time  you know  in any other movie  it would be  the Statue of Liberty  head rolls down  everyone's like  oh my god  oh my god  and then you'd cut  to the president  instead you just  stay next to  the Statue of Liberty  head  while you know  the most alpha male  in the group  is like  alright you guys  we gotta get out of here  we gotta go to Brooklyn 
[01:41:00]  and my character  is like  that's the other thing  people have been saying  is they've been like  how close is  your character  to you  if that disaster  was gonna happen  and I think  it's pretty close  I don't think  I would be the guy  that's like  alright everybody  calm down  we gotta get  to the Brooklyn Bridge  and we gotta  cross over  and get out of here  right now  I think I'd be  kind of like  we should tape this  shouldn't we  let's get  let's get  documentation of this  I think we have  a YouTube video  right exactly 
[01:41:30]  we get to do well  on YouTube  watching Lost  a lot of times  we goof around  and go  you know  I understand  the main characters  and they got  all their stories  we know them  and everything  I go  but what about  that couple  sitting sort of  in the blurry  depth of field  like in the background  what's their story  and the odd thing is  occasionally  they do bring  those people up  and you find out  who they are  and then they do  their back story 
[01:42:00]  and everything  it's like oh  so you kind of do  find out  on Lost  like who the  peripheral people  are sometimes  when they kill off  some of the main  characters  so I think that's  a cool thing to do  that you don't see  done very often  I think so too  I think JJ's  really good at that  and I think  that's one of the  interesting things about it  that's why I'm excited  to see Star Trek  because for somebody  that I'm not a huge  Star Trek fan  I know that he'll do  something different  with the story  you know  because in Star Trek  there's all those  guys that  you know  if it's one  there's one extra guy 
[01:42:30]  that goes down  to the planet  he's dead  that's it  nothing good  can come of that  I like Simon Pegg  as Scotty  yeah  that's pretty cool  oh yeah  it's good  it's good  he's great  Chris Pine  as Captain Kirk  he's probably just  going to be like  a real womanizer  he's gotta be  I mean  young Kirk  at the academy  and stuff  has to just be  banging everything  yeah  we didn't turn into that  in space  even guys  everybody  guys  girls 
[01:43:00]  we gotta get to  Ruby  so we got TJ Miller  in the studio  we talked about  Ruby earlier today  what's the deal  with Ruby there  Jimmy  he's an older gentleman  he's been a giant  season ticket holder  since the  1955 I believe  been going to games  since the 40s  yes  real fair weather fan  and he can't  he can't get  Super Bowl tickets  because  the dirty giants  only gave 12,000  tickets that they got  they gave 6,000  out to fans  which is all the NFL  gives them is 12,000  and it's a seniority  based thing 
[01:43:30]  and this guy  has had tickets  since the 50s  and I think  he's thrown into a lottery  and every time  the Giants have been  in the Super Bowl  poor Ruby  lost in the lottery  right Ruby  that's correct  I never won in the lottery  oh  well you're a big star  today  you're in the post  everyone's talking  about your plight  yes  I've tried to get  tickets to the  Super Bowl  when they won  the championship  I was so happy  elated  but I had gotten  a letter  that I was not  picked for the  lottery  and that really 
[01:44:00]  disturbed me  because I've been  a fan  and had season  tickets for over  50 years  now  what's the criteria  for winning  these things  you would think  if it's seniority  you would definitely  be in  it's seniority  and you get  a certain amount  your name is put  in a certain  amount of time  for a certain  amount of years  and then  it's picked  out of a hat  and I've never  won in all the years  and I figured  well I'm 76  years old now  and I don't know  how much longer 
[01:44:30]  I'm going to have  to go see  a Super Bowl game  well the thing is  they have  6,000 tickets  they give  they don't give  enough tickets  I think  to the fans  the true fans  yeah absolutely not  you missed  they said since  the 50s  you've only missed  8 home games  that's right  now why those  8 home games  was it weddings  or were you in  the service  service  holiday  you know  vacation  something like  that  I was in the  army for  2 years  but  served as a  in the Korean 
[01:45:00]  war  I'm a wounded  war veteran  oh jeez  oh my god  jeez  with two purple  hearts  one of our  nation's heroes  been a fan  forever  and can't get  tickets  and then  it disturbs  me  because  there's  people  there  that get  tickets  that don't  even  go  and  get rid  of them  in other  ways  and that  really  disturbs  me  and if  you want  to get  tickets  they're $3,000  up to $8,000  which is ridiculous  that's crazy  it really is a crime  a lot of the guys 
[01:45:30]  that got tickets  through the lottery  they're going to  turn around  and sell them  but not only  the ticket  is expensive  when you get  there  the hotel rooms  flying out there  it's not just  the ticket  anymore  I went to the  Super Bowl  a few years  ago  and it was  ridiculous  to get a hotel  room  and to get  a flight  out there  sure  brag to the  guy that  you went  to the  Super Bowl  yeah  absolutely  guy's been  trying for  break my heart  yeah  there you go  breaking his heart  there  break his purple  heart  I'm watching  it at my  grandmother's  this year  does that  make you feel  better  and I'm a  Patriots fan  so  oh gosh  well Ruby  we're going to 
[01:46:00]  that hurt him  you can feel  oh god  oh no  we're trying  to get  your tickets  okay  I appreciate  I wish we had  good news  that would be  such a great  way to end  this phone  call  but we're  going to try  to get you  to the damn  Super Bowl  okay  you keep  trying  I'll keep  praying  yeah  has anyone  else come  to your  defense  there  well  a couple  of things  you know  on  my wife  had put  on the  Craigslist  and  that hasn't 
[01:46:30]  come through  you know  the prices  are ridiculous  yeah  of course  and you have  to be careful  you don't buy  a fake  no  fake girl  right  yeah  I made that  mistake  I expect  a beautiful  blonde to  come over  and it's  a gentleman  it's a gentleman  with a couch  in a dress  but you go  through with it  but we're  going to give  it a shot  we're going to  try to get  you tickets  I mean  very rarely  do we succeed  at anything  you guys are  good  we're trying  don't get  your hopes up  don't count  those chickens  wait has  Ruby heard 
[01:47:00]  of the Opie  and Anthony  show  what's that  have you heard  of us  yes  of course  what do you  know about  Opie and  that's good  things  how about  you name  one thing  we've done  we're talking  to Ruby  alright Ruby  we'll be in  touch  we were trying  to get a pair  of tickets  to just do  something stupid  with but now  I'm thinking  if we get a pair  of tickets  from corporate  we're just  going to hand  them to you  and then  we'll give you  a bicycle  and you can  ride the bike 
[01:47:30]  out there  this is how  pathetic our  radio show  is  we once  gave away  Super Bowl  tickets  but they  didn't give  away the  actual trip  so we  gave tickets  away but  then the  listeners had  to find their  own way  out there  on their  own dime  that's what  I was saying  you can't  not only the  week left  you can't  even get a  flight there  oh really  you have to  take a  greyhound bus  we can make  a big thing  out of this  we've got a lot  of truckers  that listen  to the show  they can pick  up Ruby  and get him  out there  to Arizona  that's what  Ruby wants  to go  in a truck 
[01:48:00]  why don't you  just give him  a ride  with Henry Lee  Lucas  alright Ruby  good luck  to you  thank you  alright buddy  bye bye  that is just  awful  yeah it just  stinks  everyone in  Boston is laughing  right now  good  good  good you  sucker  you really  have to mouth  it  I really do  I mouthed  that  didn't I  that poor  guy  I'm a  Patriots fan  but I feel  bad for him  there's a lot  of fans that  aren't going  to get tickets  but he's been  there for so  long  they just  give these  corporate  things  you know 
[01:48:30]  whatever  and a fan  of the Giants  too  I'm going to  quit that  a long time  ago  yeah  alright  hey  before we  take a break  because we  got to get  ready for  Jay Abrams  or JJ  JJ  JJ  JJ  sure  hey I'm  going to  ask TJ  something  I don't  need to  talk about  the movie  the whole  time  this guy  is quick  on his  feet  very funny  guy  does stand  up  would you  ever have  sex with  your cousin  yeah  quick on my  feet  I'm ready  for those  ones  second  and we're 
[01:49:00]  not even  looking for  a joke  first cousin  Anthony admitted  that he would  have sex  with his  first cousin  I didn't say  that  you're twisting  this around  I said  when I was  growing up  between the  ages of  probably 12  and 16  I had  I had a  first cousin  that was  very hot  thank you  that was  very hot  and if  the situation  would have  come about  I may have  had sex  with her  I think  it's creepier  imagining you  12 years old  like yeah  that was pretty  creepy  like yeah  that possibility  yeah 
[01:49:30]  yeah I don't  think so  you haven't  had a cousin  that you  thought was  hot  oh no  definitely  all of  them  yeah  you know  but I  think  yeah  I don't  think  you never  thought  like  like  if the  situation  presented itself  maybe  I think  I think  I had a  second cousin  that maybe  would  that I  would have  you might  go second  yeah  never first  always  I'm not  talking about  boyfriend and  girlfriend here  either  I'm just  talking one  one slam  session  and you know  one and done  you didn't cover  your initials in 
[01:50:00]  the tree with  your cousin  right  one in the  family tree  and the branch  turns around  and turns into  a mongoloid  you phrased it  as a slam  session with a  family member  yes  I think  I actually  changed my  mind  yeah  see  I have  another  scenario  though  okay  let's  say  you're  in  manhattan  and the  city is  getting  destroyed  by you know  this  cloverfield  monster  oh gee  now you're  thinking you  might not  survive the  day  would you  actually have  a slam  session  with your  first cousin  with the  monster  involved  well the  monster  that's the 
[01:50:30]  reason  with the  monster  I'd go down  to my  mom  that was a  case  if it came  down to  just to get  something  before I  went yeah  if there was  a monster  in town  yeah I think  with that  factor  and that  may push  me over  the edge  but then  you got  to answer  to God  well  this is just  your way of  segwaying  into trying  to get me  to convert  to Christianity  now that  we're on  the subject  now that  we  you've  admitted to  sleeping  with cousins  and all kinds  of sinful 
[01:51:00]  behavior  this is kind  of an  intervention  I would  never  with a  cousin  but one  of my  ex-girlfriends  did have  sex with  her first  cousin  a few  times  and what  did she  say about  it  it was  really hot  and dirty  and then  he fell  for her  and she  got annoyed  wow  see  that's  probably  a problem  he wanted  to tell  the family  oh wow  no shut  up  I had a  crush on a  cousin  when I was  young  oh ok see  but it wasn't  sexual at all  it was like 
[01:51:30]  an honest  it was kind  of like a  crush  like when I  was like  14  but there  was no  sexual  dude you  are incapable  of a crush  without some  kind of  sexual tie in  there  I'm incapable  of one  with it  I don't have  crushes with  sexual things  I either have  a crush  and I want to  give you kisses  on the cheeks  I think you're  adorable  thank you Jimmy  or  I'm here  or  or  or  I want to  treat your mouth  like a blow up doll  alright we gotta break  with care and respect  yeah of course  with a lot of love  with respect 
[01:52:00]  we have to break  but I was  leading to something  Tim  Tim took your conversation  about the first cousin thing  yeah  I came up with this  are you down and out  looking for love  in all the wrong places  try Anthony  Cumia's guide  to picking up  at family gatherings  I'd do an adopted  sister  first  spot your target  look at a cousin  that had  a nice ass 
[01:52:30]  and a good set  on her  and look and go  wow  that's attractive  if she's related  all the better  I had a crush  on one of my cousins  growing up  in Anthony's guide  he reminds you  to not let the physical  become emotional  it had nothing to do  with love  or wanting a relationship  I was a goat  just a horndog  Anthony Cumia's guide  to picking up  at family gatherings  where incest  is the only  viable alternative  I'm Anthony Cumia  and I endorse 
[01:53:00]  this product  we gotta get  all the endorsements  that you've done  in the last few weeks  and let's play it  as all one break  tomorrow  I don't like the word  incest  that really puts  the kibosh  on the whole thing  I'm just talking  about two  youngsters  young adults  of puberty age  just kind of  getting together  and blowing off  some steam  incest makes it  sound too sexy  no 
[01:53:30]  it makes it sound  like weird  in a way  that's beyond  the weirdness  that I'm portraying  it makes it sound  like you wanna  get married  and tell the family  and you know  be shunned  what did you wanna do  as you were building  as you were just  about there  when she went  to say something  did you wanna  just touch her lips  and go  it's the ultimate taboo  ooh  yeah  watch the movie  taboo  the original porn  it's wonderful  I've seen that  isn't it great  it is great  JJ Abrams  next  Opie and Anthony  right back into it 
[01:54:00]  Bob Kelly  Stress Factory  let's not forget that  New Brunswick  New Jersey  tonight  tomorrow  and Saturday  you got TJ Miller  one of the stars  of Cloverfield  and a new friend  of the show  sitting on the couch  of course the guy  that was behind  the camera  for most of the movie  the star  the star  of Cloverfield  right  he wants to make  sure we say that  because the boss  is on the line  right now  that's right  the great  JJ Abrams  JJ  how are you sir 
[01:54:30]  how are you guys doing  pretty good  we're all big fans  of this movie  Cloverfield  right on  thank you so much  and you got a lot  of Lost fans  in the studio  as well  thank you so much  for watching  and you got  Star Trek fans  yes  so we need  to talk to you  so the teaser  so cool man  even the teaser  just makes you  want to go  come on  hurry  get this damn  movie out  that's great  I gotta ask you  quickly about  Star Trek movie  Kirk character  gonna be a womanizer  right there  in the academy  he really wouldn't  be Kirk 
[01:55:00]  if there wasn't  some of that  good  that's what  we want to see  every problem  solved by grabbing  a broad  and just starting  to kiss her  I love the Kirk  solution  little of that  little of that  hey how surprised  are you or you  not surprised at all  that you were  number one  at the box office  with this  oh it's really  you hear me  and there's one  reason I think  that happened  why  TJ Miller  yes  wow  I was waiting  for it and then  it happened  nice  thank you very  much JJ  we have a special  bond because we  both have initials 
[01:55:30]  for our first name  yeah pretty crazy  you broke all  I mean we broke  all the records  right  let them say that  you don't want to  yeah  yeah  all records  just shattered  I actually said  that to TJ  he didn't know  it until I told  him he's like  really he's  kind of asking  like we broke  the record  he's very humble  about it  yeah  I literally  I honestly  I'm in shock  but what did  you really do  for this movie  what did I do  I don't even know  we don't really  know what a producer  does  I'm just 
[01:56:00]  I'm just joking  but we don't  know what a  producer does  it's confounding  right  yeah  it could be anything  you know a lot of  times a producer  is just someone  who paid the money  to get the movie  made  but that you know  yeah  they come up  with the cash  I was very lucky  to get to work  with a writer  who is a genius  this guy Drew Goddard  who worked on  Alias and Lost  and Buffy  and he's amazing  and then  and Matt Reeves  who is one of  my best friends  who were kids  who directed the movie  and so  part of the fun  of this was not only 
[01:56:30]  coming up with the idea  but working with them  Ryan Burke  a producer  as an old friend  it was just  like making a student  film again  kind of  what a great concept  too  and it had similar  camera work  to a student film  yeah  I gotta say  you know  CJ  you did an unbelievable  job  because not only  were you acting  often not on screen  for the most part  but you're also  you know  quite often  the operator  the camera operator  yeah  that was amazing  do you know  one of my favorite  things about Lost  this is Jim Norton  hey how you doing 
[01:57:00]  nothing  no  thank you  for not knowing  who he is  but of course not  the more important  they are  the less likely  they are  to either  recognize Jim  or Norton  I Lost  I haven't gotten  through all  I'm only still  on the second season  because I very rarely  will watch a show  when it's on  I just kind of  catch up  and I talk about it  like a year after  everybody's done  talking about it  and it's such a good show  it's amazing to me  to watch a show  on network television  that I love that much  I'm such a sissy  I have cried  watching 
[01:57:30]  I can't  I don't know why  I cry constantly  watching that show  it's really great  the guy who runs  the show now  who I created  the show with  his name is  Damon Lindelof  and that guy  is brilliant  and it's amazing  how emotional  that show is  and part of it  is the writing  part of it is the music  Michael Giacchino  is the composer  he just got nominated  for an Academy Award  for Ratatouille  the guy is incredible  we have an amazingly  talented cast 
[01:58:00]  it's a totally  you know  I'm a huge fan  of it  I like the fact  that it's involved  there's a lot  going on  it wasn't like  oh boy  we gotta dumb  this down  so people can  get a hold  of it  I mean a lot  of jokes  were made  about the fact  that you couldn't  come in  halfway through  the season  or you'd be  completely lost  but I love  the fact  that it's very  involved  it keeps you  interested  I feel like  you know 
[01:58:30]  the thing  that  one of the things  that Damon did  last year  which I thought  was the greatest  thing ever  is that  he convinced  ABC  to give us  an end  date  for the series  so that we would  know how long  it would last  so that  we weren't  you know  be drawing out  things that  didn't need to be  drawn out  that we kind  of knew how  to pace  ourselves  so that  by the end  of the run  of the series  it felt like  there wasn't  a lot of  wheel spinning 
[01:59:00]  and time wasting  so that we know  what the beginning  middle and end  of the whole series  is going to be  No  stop it  you don't  I love the fact  that it's like  no everything  we know  from the beginning  to the end  is planned out  and written  and we know  what it's going  to do  and I'm like  no  No  it's true  and I gotta say  that Damon  of course you have  to kind of be  flexible  because you never  know if an idea  that comes up  is going to work  and if the actor  is going to be  what you want  and if the story  is going to play out  but Damon  literally has pitched  to me 
[01:59:30]  not only the end  of the series  but literally  to the end  the last shot  and what is it  and go  can you say that  the last episode  last year  this is Rob  I didn't see it  Bob  you're going to  blow it for me  I'm not going to  say anything about it  Jesus calm down  Jimmy  I'm not mad  I took his headphones  off like he was  going to fight me  no no no  I love it  that's how people  with Lost are though  it's like  don't tell me  I got it like  recorded  shut up  I take that back  not fight me  but bite me 
[02:00:00]  this is Robert Kelly  by the way  nothing  I just wanted to  try that  at least me  he thought it  sounded familiar  but with you  he thought you  were a roadie  he thought you  were an American  history-esque  excuse me  suck  American history-esque  the last episode  last year  it could have  been a movie  that actually  could have been  in theaters  that's how good it is  I did an amazing  job of that  I'm glad you liked it  he actually blew 
[02:00:30]  off my compliments  he was talking  about Malcolm Eskimo  shut up  because I don't  work on the show  week to week  I feel like  I can't take credit  for that thing  so it's like  Damon literally  is the guy  who put that  together  and Carlton Hughes  who writes with  there's so many  people who work  on that thing  this is just  because the movie  was such a success  or else you'd be  taking credit  for everything  in Lost 
[02:01:00]  the truth is  there is one thing  that's missing  from Lost for me  TJ Miller  TJ back to you  well people can be  brought in  I've seen it happen  I love the fact  that you never know  if a major character  is going to be killed off  that's another great  thing about the show  TJ has a question  for you  JJ about Cloverfield  one of the things  I wanted to know  I'm getting a lot  and you were in the movie  that's how mysterious  JJ Abrams projects are  I was in the movie  and I'm like  hey I got a question  what was that thing 
[02:01:30]  I got a question  no  you know  I'm starting to get  sort of fanboys  which is what  you know  we lovingly call  the internet fans  of JJ Abrams  and of Lost  and of all these  great projects  I'm starting to get them  come up and ask  if there's crossover  if there's references  to Lost  in Cloverfield  you know  if there's certain things  that they should look for  you know  and a lot of people  are talking about  the end of the movie 
[02:02:00]  has something  that if you don't see it  a couple of times  you're going to miss it  and I don't even know  what to say to them  I just kind of  you know  try and give them  an autograph  that they didn't ask for  push them away  and go back  hoping they're asking  for a picture  or something  go back  to the strip club  right  so  is there any  crossover  that you can talk about  there are definitely  a couple references  in the movie  I knew it  they were hidden there  for the people 
[02:02:30]  who  you know  for the fanboys  for the people  who would care  and it's  because I love  that kind of stuff  so much  that really is  the reason we do it  not for any other reason  and there are some  references to some things  there are a whole bunch  of hidden things  in the movie  wow  I love that  because that just makes me  I think at least twice  I've been like  no  I don't think  there's any crossover  well we actually  didn't want to talk  about any of that stuff  because we thought  well let's see how long  it takes people  to find these things  it's actually fun 
[02:03:00]  checking out  how quickly  people make  these discoveries  there are a bunch  of things  that people haven't found  but JJ  help us out a little bit  a lot of people  are going to go back  and see this movie  for the second time  give us one little thing  to look for  I'll say this  there's a quick  lost reference  before the movie  really starts  wow  okay  there's that  is that on  the bootleg  can I have your  home address  come over 
[02:03:30]  and point it out  for me  you know  is that on  the copy  where the guy's  coughing through  the whole movie  can I  people get up  for popcorn  I gotta relate  the worst  I gotta relate  a story to them  though  we get screener  copies all the time  and they finally  got smart  with Ant and I  because  now  we get  the screener  copies  and across  the whole  screen  it says  Opie and Anthony  this is for  Opie and Anthony  so if we do  make some  copy or something  they're gonna  know right away 
[02:04:00]  I have never  copied  it's so distracting  because if it  seems like dark  all you see  is your name  yeah  it is very  distracting  they finally  got smart  because now  they'll know  where they  come from  that's in  every copy  of the movie  everywhere  wow  I was wondering  why it was  getting so popular  why not an  Opie and Anthony  reference in  Cloverfield  that was such  a good point  you know  that is so good  maybe if we do  a sequel  yes  I think  there is 
[02:04:30]  an Opie and  Anthony  reference  right before  the movie  starts  and it's  usually  when Opie  and Anthony  see it  they just  reference  themselves  to people  around  yeah  JJ I got  your sequel  I'm thinking  you do a  whole other  movie  but you do  it in a  Hollywood way  and you  explain this  whole thing  and then you  go back to  the tape  maybe here  and there  but you  got the  president  talking about  the monster  and you  get the  big showdown  to the end  what I love  about  Cloverfield  is that  it doesn't  have the  stuff  that you've  seen  in every  damn  you're there  just watching 
[02:05:00]  Fox 5  and the whole  cast  they all  look great  and I look  like I just  thought I was  doing radio  you're just  standing in the  background  hungover  you're so used  to not being  on camera  you're like  that doesn't  matter  yeah  exactly  I thought I  was going  to be  shooting  the interviews  this is all  over the place  though  it really  is amazing  are you guys  going to do  the sequel  and you got  an idea  for it  there's a couple  ideas that are  being thrown  around  but we're just  still in shock  that the movie  is being received  so well  look at you  you're all serious 
[02:05:30]  talking on Fox  Fox  TJ right now  TJ is talking  on Fox 5  he's on Fox  and he looks  like Viking  from Bad Boys  or Tweety  no Viking  no Viking  from Bad Boys  with Sean Penn  and luckily  they sandwiched me  between Michael  Stal David  and Mike Vogel  one's on the cover  of Men's Health  and the other one  walks around  in a picture  of Men's Health  the only person  I can compete  with is Matt Reeves  who currently  looks like Harry Potter  a little bit  is that Matt Reeves  yeah that's the director  right there 
[02:06:00]  and Matt  an older Harry Potter  well it really was  cool JJ  because you guys  really did  it was kind of  a boys club feeling  only in the sense  that all of you guys  were friends  for so long  and so it was  a fun set  to work on  Matt Reeves  and Brian Burke  who's one of the  producers  and I  have known you  for years  so the whole  thing was like  making a student  film again  hey you have a comment  about some of these  websites that are  popping up  and there's a lot  of rumors  that there's one  that's supposed  to show pictures  of stuff washed  up on Coney Island 
[02:06:30]  I've not seen  that site  oh so you're not  going to take any  credit for that  I don't know  what you're talking  about  viral marketing  continues  because there's  websites popping  up with stuff  that looks like  it's washed up  that could possibly  be one of these  creatures  interesting  yeah  interesting indeed  you really  my only complaint  about the movie  is I actually  would have liked  it to have been  a little bit longer  like what did  it come in at  like what was  the final time  hour and a half  yeah  it's very short 
[02:07:00]  I would love  10 minutes  is there any  extra time  going to be  on a DVD  I would love  to see  yeah there's  actually a bunch  of extra scenes  and deleted scenes  that we're putting  on the DVD  but the  you know  I'm so sick  of seeing movies  that are 2 hours  in 45 minutes  I felt like  you know  I keep feeling  if there's a movie  that's over  in 90 minutes  I'll see it twice  as opposed to once  you know  a 3 hour movie  so we decided  we're going to make  this movie short  but some people  say it's too short  you obviously know  I think it was  mentioned  you left the sequel  wide open  and you could do 
[02:07:30]  a sequel like  with a lot of  integrity  where it wouldn't  look cheesy at all  because there's a lot  of unanswered  questions  let's just say  there's not a  Hollywood ending  to this movie  which is great  yeah I think  there's a lot  of monsters  I think this was  one that kind of  got separated  from the pod  ooh look  hey JJ  you were aware  that the shaky  camera work  was going to  bother some people  right  oh man  this movie  is so not  for everyone  I'm serious  the Cloverfield  I've gotten  reports that people  have thrown up  in theaters  not just like  in the news  which I've read  but like friends 
[02:08:00]  who said  yeah I was there  and this woman  just puking  really  I feel horrible  about that  but you know  if you're like  pregnant  or if you're  you know  if you get  motion sickness  easily  you should not  see this movie  well Jimmy  suggested you  sit in the  back of the  theater  and that will  help  I have bad  motion sickness  it didn't affect  me because I  sat in the last row  yeah  I saw  I went to  a theater  to check it  out at a  stadium theater  where the screen  fills the wall  and I swear to god  if I didn't know  what to expect  I would have  gotten sick  well what's funny  is people will  say that  and they'll make  a joke about it 
[02:08:30]  yeah that camera  work  you need some  Dramamine  before that  yeah that makes  you really sick  and I shot a lot  of the film  so I had this  like personal  like I'm like  oh you think  that's funny  I shot that  but it's good  because it looks  like a real motion  it does  it looks  yeah  and you know  if you'll recall  we didn't  when we were  shooting it  I think you guys  took special care  to continue to  make it look  real  but keep it  as steady  as possible  because that  wasn't the  it's not like  we were walking  around like  who cares if  people throw up 
[02:09:00]  in the theater  the thing is  that the goal  was just  let's film it  as if  we're actually  making this  whole movie  but the thing  is that when  you're looking  at it that  big  it really  it can be  too much  on a TV  screen  so much  of what you're  looking at  in the room  is not moving  when you're  at a theater  the whole  wall is  it's crazy  that's pretty smart  though  you couldn't have  clicked on the  anti-jitter thing  on the camera  maybe  yeah  that little  anti-shaking 
[02:09:30]  help us out  here TJ  so much of  the movie  especially the  stuff that was  not shot  brilliantly by the way  by TJ  was stuff that  you know  was designed  to look that way  so it's like  a lot of the stuff  that looks amateurish  was incredibly  planned out  so I'm not  blaming TJ  TJ  did you get  TJ  did you get a  camera credit  on that  no  did I  JJ  maybe  no  there's  no  camera  no  camera  credit  interesting 
[02:10:00]  that would be  an extra  paycheck  wouldn't it  I was paid  that's what I was  going to say  I didn't get  a camera credit  but on the other  hand I wasn't  paid anything  extra  TJ  tell the story  about when you  met Chris Pine  who's the star  of Star Trek  oh yeah  so I go to  the Star Trek  set which is  going to be  amazing  just by looking  at what they're  doing  from that one  day that I was  on the set  it's going to  be unbelievable  and I go in  and everybody  was talking to me 
[02:10:30]  and they're like  oh oh  you gotta meet  Chris Pine  he's so funny  he's like you  he's so funny  he's really  really funny  I think Jim  Norton  I mentioned this  the last time  and you were  saying like  whenever people  say that  they're never  the funniest  guy ever  and so  but I go over  to him  and  he's playing  Kirk  yeah he's  Captain Kirk  he's the main  guy  he's the star  of the new  Star Trek  and so I walk  over to him  and I go  hey how you  doing I'm  TJ Miller  I'm the star  of Cloverfield  I'm the  the star  I'm like the  big star 
[02:11:00]  in it  and he goes  hey what's up  how you doing  you know  fine to meet  you and  everything  and then  Zach Kinto  was playing  Dr. Spock  was there  and he was  being awkward  the baby doctor  yeah  Dr. Spock  we have  we have  Benjamin Spock  yes  Benjamin Spock  it's a strange  casting choice  I stand by it  and so then  later on  it got back  to me  that Chris Pine  didn't get  that I was  joking  at all  and he just  thought I was  this big  douche bag  and was 
[02:11:30]  wow  I just loved it  he thought you  were a total dick  yeah he really  really believed  that I just  walked over  and I was like  hey I'm the star  of Cloverfield  you know that  big movie  that's coming out  so don't think  you're so hot  what a sense  of humor then  yeah  I just loved  that TJ  you know  was just  totally goofing  around  and Chris  was like  is that guy  really a jerk  yeah  no he's kidding  I don't think so  he had an idea  JJ I have an  important question  because Lost  is premiering  very shortly  we want some  lost people  on this radio  program  to help  promote  oh yeah

[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  I don't think he would have said anything about it. 
[02:19:00]  He likes being secretive.  It's just known.  You know, it's the whole crew that you know and love from Star Trek, but in the Academy, in their Academy days, so they've recast it with younger actors, obviously.  And that's that.  And that's that.  I think they did a great job of casting.  If you look through who they got and how they look as the characters, it's pretty cool.  How come Shatner, I should have asked him that, but I asked the last cast person.  Shatner's mad.  Yeah.  Why didn't he have, maybe he didn't want to break that wall and make it too much. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, well, Shatner died in one of the movies.  Well, Shatner died in one of the previous movies.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  So all the fanboys would get really pissed off if they saw him.  He died?  That never means anything.  Spock died in, you know.  But he's not.  And they do him back to life like he's this super creature.  Right?  Super creature.  Like he's this man of power.  But Simon Pegg as Scotty, I think, is good.  He's from Shaun of the Dead.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Really funny.  I think that's a great job of casting. 
[02:20:00]  A little comic relief, perhaps.  And then whoever they got, the guy from Heroes is playing Spock.  What's his name there, Than?  Zachary Quinto, who plays Siler on Heroes.  Yeah, and he looks like a young Spock.  I mean, they did a really good job casting.  They got some young colored broad to play Uhura.  Ooh, nice.  I like that.  Nice.  I'm going to use the 50s vernacular.  Yeah.  Those broads were built for fucking. 
[02:20:30]  I like that.  Yeah, let's go to Andrew on Long Island.  Andrew.  Andrew.  The Lynx is saying Andrews.  They called it Garth without the L.  Okay, Pookie.  Hi, guys.  Love you.  I love the show.  Yeah, we're sure you do.  Yeah, what's up?  Fuck yourself.  What?  Me and my dad are big fans of the show.  I just want to give him a shout out because it's his birthday.  Sure.  What's your dad's name?  Nah.  Exactly.  Ooh, he's calling back so quickly.  This kid really wants to give him a birthday fucking shout out. 
[02:21:00]  Drudge Report.  Don't worry.  We're all over it.  Somebody's like, you got to go to Drudge.  What's going on on Drudge?  There's a nurse raping the elderly.  Don't worry.  We're on top of it.  Since when is Drudge doing sexy stories?  Exactly.  I thought I was on top of it.  Yeah.  Nurse charged with sexually abusing two dozen patients at an Ohio nursing home.  Now, by nurse, you don't mean a nurse like we know them.  Female, nice legs and stuff like that.  You're talking the creepy male nurse? 
[02:21:30]  Well, yes.  His name's John.  John, I'm a nurse.  Of course he is.  So much less sexy.  Yes.  Nothing's creepier than a male nurse at an old age home.  With a can of Vaseline spitting in his hand before he goes in the room.  He's just constantly going in the supply closet for more Vaseline and they can't figure out  what he needs so much for.  We don't use it.  I don't remember his patients chafing that much.  Before we continue, I want to give our new friend T.J. Miller a little advice.  Yes.  If you ever want to work in Hollywood again, you might want to just leave right now. 
[02:22:00]  No.  Because the conversation we're about to have could be a problem for you.  Oh, don't discourage him.  We like having friends in the business.  No, your future movie-making career.  And then we have parents through hospital after stillborn babies, body sent to cleaners.  So we have one sexy story followed up by a hoot.  You guys definitely have some slightly riskier material.  Yeah, just sad.  You can save face. 
[02:22:30]  Just come up with an excuse like you got an email or a text or something.  You feel uncomfortable.  They have to go sexually abuse some patients.  Some elderly.  That's right.  Some elderly.  Some fucking burdens.  Deep dicking a burden.  Next on News 2.  At least they're good for something tomorrow on Fox.  I can't believe T.J. would say that.  Exactly.  That was me.  That was Jim Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Luckily, Jim Norton's got that raspy, sick voice.  Yeah.  So we can distinguish which stillborn jokes are his. 
[02:23:00]  Well, this is the abusing the elderly sexually.  The stillborn stuff we're going to save, we're going to bridge into it.  Hey, do we have some sexy music for this story?  Maybe a little porn or...  Nice.  This is fucking hot.  So this guy works in an old folks home.  That's right.  In Sandusky, Ohio.  Sandusky?  Oof.  I'll just wait for the music and then we'll do the story.  Imagine that.  You're just some old codger in Sandusky.  Your kids have abandoned you in this fucking shithole.  And here comes the male nurse. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy's got the sexy voice today because he's a little sex rat.  That's right.  Why don't you use that sexy voice, Jimmy?  Get those cocks out, gents.  A nice shift nurse cues of sexually abusing as many as two dozen elderly or disabled patients.  At a nursing home was in jail Wednesday.  Many of the victims at Concord Care and Rehabilitation Center were unable to...  Had no idea what was happening.  Of course they didn't.  They had no idea.  They were unable to report the abuse.  Stop whining.  And some have since died.  Stop whining. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  He really knew when to get them.  Fucking put a satin pillow under their head and fuck them.  All right.  Oh, that's not the story.  Police said the suspected man is 24 victims judging by statements.  Suspect John Rhimes made it into questioning.  Rhimes, 49, pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Sandusky Municipal Court to felony charges of rape and gross imposition.  No, gross sexual imposition.  Oh, yes.  Gross sexual imposition.  What is he?  He's imposing.  Sorry to impose. 
[02:24:30]  But I thought I'd fuck your cancerous mouth.  Oh, God.  I hope I'm not imposing as I rape your one-breasted torso.  Jesus, what a sociopath.  You are.  No.  I'm not the guy who did it.  You sound like Danny Bonaduce today.  Really?  Oh, we're talking real fast.  I can't say Danny.  I'll talk a whole lot until you can jump in and go, this guy isn't saying a fucking thing.  We get it.  You're ranting.  The director at the nursing home said in a statement that Rhimes had been fired.  I would hope so. 
[02:25:00]  Oh.  Imagine if it said he'd been given a raise pending investigation.  What's his name?  R-I-E-M-S.  John Rhimes.  Oh, I thought you said Reams.  Or Reams.  R-I-E.  Or appropriate.  Reams would be more appropriate.  And we cannot share any more detail at this time out of respect of the privacy of our  residents and in light of the ongoing investigation.  They're looking into his past.  Blah, blah, blah.  So they are.  Which include employment at other facilities.  Of course.  Two dozen old people.  How does your dick get hard for two dozen old people? 
[02:25:30]  For one.  For one, of course.  Jesus Christ.  Well, he's a special kind of guy.  One of those guys that are kind of into that, I guess.  Old people.  I think it's really funny that, uh.  Baby powder and death.  That's what turns him on.  Yeah.  Many of the victims were unable to report the abuse.  Just sitting there going.  Shut up.  Have another pill.  They would just point to their ass and tears would come down.  Oh, fuck.  Fucking creepy male nurse.  Take care of your parents when they're old. 
[02:26:00]  Or at least set up a video camera in the room so you can have some laughs at a party.  Oh, you can have your own, uh, halftime show.  What do you think, like, the, the, uh, I'm sure there are children of these elderly, you  know, grown, uh, that had to put them away for whatever reason, Alzheimer's or something.  They already got the guilt.  They still visit.  They have the guilt.  They have the guilt of putting them away.  And then you find out they were rolled over and just fucked in the ass by some scumbag  that works there.  Like, how did, how did these people go to trial, go to jail, and not one family member 
[02:26:30]  kills them?  Because there's metal detectors in the court.  They protect you.  That's the whole reason.  There's gotta be a way to, every system is put there to make it look like it's secure.  Not for real security.  Let's be honest here.  There's gotta be a way to kill them.  There's gotta be a way to kill that fucking guy.  If that would, let me tell you, I love my mommy.  And if she loses her mind, which talking to her lately could probably happen any minute,  and she has to be put in a home, uh, and I find out someone starts tagging her, you 
[02:27:00]  gotta kill the guy.  Your mom's hot.  You gotta.  Oh, she'd be tops on the list.  She'd be the first to go.  Oh, first to go.  He wouldn't even get arrested for that.  Forget it.  She'd be the first dozen.  Yeah, yeah, the first dozen.  It wouldn't even be a dozen elderly.  It would be my mom a dozen times.  He actually wouldn't bang your mom because she's so hot.  What, would he take her to the movie?  I'm not into that.  I'm not into that.  I want an old bag.  This chick's in shape.  But do you think that, um, the families feel guilty now?  Like, they'll, like, start looking back and, oh my god, that's why that guy was wiping 
[02:27:30]  off his dick every time we walked into the room.  Yeah, the signs were all there.  I would walk in and he would be having sex with her.  Yeah.  The subtle signs were there.  His cock was in mom's mouth.  You guys are assuming that these people didn't like it, though.  That is true.  I like that angle.  Do you think out of two dozen...  Yeah, two dozen, at least one person is like, oh, wow, is this cool.  This is one lady.  We just can't wait for 12 o'clock.  That's a sick thought, but I'm with Bobby. 
[02:28:00]  I bet you there is at least one or two.  Out of two dozen, there's got to be one or two that we're like, finally, I'm getting  fucked.  One person is pissed because he's getting, you know, arrested for this.  It's like, ugh, there it goes.  There goes Saturday night.  The old lady just, as she shuts her eyes, she pretends she's sleeping every time he  comes in.  She's like, on the phone, I gotta go, I gotta go.  Getting all prepared.  Oh, yeah.  For her deep dickin'.  Rubs flowers on her cunt.  Oh.  Those grape pubes powdering it up.  She rubs grape juice on her nipples just so it tastes good. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, God.  Hey, I saw a dumb movie called The Savages.  It's kind of like an indie flick with, um, with, uh, hold on.  God damn it.  Where's that bell?  Oh.  We're all thinking the same thing.  Yeah, make it up.  Ding, ding.  I don't know where my bell is.  And it's featured that very famous, uh, actor there, uh, uh.  He's at Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Oh.  Yeah, and they talk about nursing homes, and it was really interesting.  He, he, he's a sarcastic douche in this movie, and he's like, ah, shit, I forgot. 
[02:29:00]  What's the name of this movie?  Uh, The Savages, yes.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And, uh, they have to put, uh, dear old dad away in this movie.  Yeah.  It's just horrific, and it's a nursing home in Buffalo.  It's just, it's just gray and awful.  Ew.  And, and they go to one of the joints.  They're trying to figure out where to put dear old dad, and they notice that the lawns  are all manicured nice, and it looks really nice on the outside, right?  Like, you're going to maybe, like, a college campus or something.  Yeah.  And Philip Seymour, uh, Hoffman's character is like, that's, they, they do that so we don't feel 
[02:29:30]  guilty about the fact that we're putting  our parent in this place for the rest  of their lives. In the home. Because he's like  our parents will never see how  nice this place looks from the outside.  No, they're in their room. And he's like, it's all the same  on the inside, but they dolly it up on the outside  so you don't feel guilty. Well, it's hard. What do you do  to your parents? You want to take care of them,  but then again, you don't want them bumbling around the apartment  with a book of matches. Well, that's just it.  It's usually for their own safety.  Yeah. And so you gotta like tuck them  away somewhere. They fall. My girl's 
[02:30:00]  mom was, I mean, she's  dying. She's really sick.  What is she dying of? Well, she's just old.  She's really old.  She's just old.  Oh, Jesus.  Is it right?  Does she  have any money at least?  Well, no, she's very sick and they were going to put her in a home.  Sorry, Bobby.  This is not a time or the place.  It's not my mom.  Well, you have to because the elderly could hurt themselves 
[02:30:30]  or you  I forgot that one.  I'm sorry, I'm a ringer.  Tony.  She smokes.  She still smokes.  She looks good, huh?  She smokes a lot.  Oh, and she  we actually were at the table with  and she's smoking a butt.  She fell asleep because of medication.  We looked up.  She was on fire.  Nice.  The cigarette had fallen into her little pocket on her robe  and she just was out.  Like a stuntman?  We just had a stunt. 
[02:31:00]  She just goes.  Actually, half the table is in tinfoil.  Her end of the table is all covered in tinfoil.  So she doesn't burn things?  Yeah.  I like that if you hear that incorrectly,  you're like, so my girl's mom, she's smoking.  You know what I mean?  She's on fire.  She's on fire.  Hey, does she have the oxygen tank and all that?  No, she doesn't want anything.  She said, I don't want anything.  I don't want to be in the hospital.  Just, I'm not taking any pills.  Let her drop dead.  Let me smoke until I die. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, she eats donuts and she smokes.  God bless her.  God bless.  She's wonderful.  How's Dawn?  Is she freaked out though?  Is she like wanting to get better?  Is she like that?  Well, you know, it's a mom's decision.  There's no getting better from old.  Well, you know what I'm saying?  If someone's living an unhealthy life,  they could add a few years.  Can they?  My grandfather was 97.  97 years young, Bob.  97 years old.  And it's a great way to,  he doesn't care about anything.  He doesn't care what he wears.  He'll come down with whatever he throws on. 
[02:32:00]  Dude, we're the selfish ones  because you try to get your parents to eat right  or older people to eat right and be healthy.  And you got to realize they don't want to.  They live their lives  and they want to eat their fucking chicken wings  and chain smoke.  They've done it all.  Absolutely.  They don't want to, you know,  sacrifice by eating a salad every night  and not smoking  and having that urge in their body  and not doing anything about it.  An extra two years, maybe.  We're the ones that feel guilty.  Like, oh, you can,  Pops, come on.  I want you around a little longer.  He doesn't want to be around a little longer. 
[02:32:30]  He doesn't want to be around a little longer.  I want you in a chair drooling for 10 years.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my grandfather hates him.  We were taking him to eat  and he was like,  you need a tie to go to this restaurant.  He just got a piece of rope  and made a tie.  Yeah, good for him.  That's what you ought to do.  But we're the selfish bastards  that want him around and stuff.  They don't want to be around  eating salads and not drinking.  They want to booze and smoke  and eat whatever the fuck they want.  They lived it up back in the old days.  Yeah, they lived it up.  They're ready to go.  They don't want you wiping their ass. 
[02:33:00]  They don't want you taking care of them,  treating them like a child.  I can imagine that.  Remember they said that?  Mom and Dad,  remember you said that  when you need help  when you're falling  and I'm on my way to a gig  and I'm too busy to call someone.  My dad,  we would get on him  about eating right  and then he would be  sneaking his chicken wings and stuff  because he would feel the guilt  and then you finally realize,  let the fucking guy  do whatever the fuck he wants.  He's in his 70s now.  Let him have fun  the last few years.  You don't want to be  sneaking chicken wings  at that age.  You don't want to feel guilty  because your kids 
[02:33:30]  are constantly on you  to eat better.  Yeah, her mom  just sits there  and smokes  and he has a hunk of lamb  and a cigarette  and then she just passes out.  You know what?  To her,  she's happy, man.  And she wakes up  and just cracks up.  She was on fire.  She's like,  where's the cigarette?  I can't find it.  She's on fire  with just taking bottles of water  and dumping it over her.  How old is she?  Ah, she's got to be in her 80s.  That's giving up though.  It's not even,  like you have to give up  at some point.  It's not that you've decided  that this is what you enjoy 
[02:34:00]  and you're doing it.  At some point,  you reach an age  where you just have to give up.  Yeah, but you know what they do?  This is what they do.  You know the Grim Reaper  is like right over your shoulder.  Exactly.  Why bother with anything anymore?  They put you in a hospital.  They give you a pill for this.  Then that affects your liver.  Then they give you a liver pill.  That affects your kidney.  And then all of a sudden,  you just,  everything's going wrong.  She's actually lived long.  When she said,  get me out of here.  I don't want any pills.  I don't want anything.  Whatever happens, happens.  I'm going to just live my life.  She's lived,  she's actually better than she was  when she was on all the medication  and going to the doctors all the time. 
[02:34:30]  I just see it like,  the commercials on TV  for like AARP  and insurance things  and just,  they have these old bats.  They're like 70,  whatever,  75 years old.  And they're going,  and these are the best years  of my life.  And you're thinking,  wow,  what a shitty fucking life  you must have led.  You don't want to be  fucking 25?  25 fucking some doughboy  getting back from Europe?  What the fuck?  You know,  these are the best years of your life?  You're shitting yourself? 
[02:35:00]  Taking 80 pills?  Yeah,  old people want to fuck.  Stop it.  Old people want to fuck.  Back to the first sexy story.  They're in hell.  They just sit there  waiting for a good fucking  and it never comes.  That's what this nurse  was trying to do.  Yeah.  He was trying to do something  giving public service.  He's giving back to the community.  He's a fuck fairy.  In his mind,  he was a fuck fairy.  Yes.  You go to sleep  with your colostomy  on the fucking...  What is a colostomy?  God damn  the fucking thought of me.  Colostomy bag?  The thought of me.  I'm sorry, guys.  I took cough medicine 
[02:35:30]  last night.  Buckley's.  What?  I'm tired.  Spuds?  I can't wait for Jimmy  to be old  and his kid  having to take care of him  and wipe his ass.  Jimmy ain't having kids.  He's got to be  in a stable relationship  of some sort  to have kids  and we know that ain't happening.  His kid would be wiping his ass  and Jimmy would get a heart on.  I gotta give...  Oh, god damn it.  I gotta give Jimmy  some credit.  Like yesterday,  we talked to the psychologist  about the Heath Ledger thing.  Yes.  By the way,  we're gonna replay it  one more time at 11  when we get out of here.  Right after the live show,  we're gonna replay  that phone call from yesterday. 
[02:36:00]  A lot of people  are talking about it.  There's a nice buzz  in the ONA community  about the whole thing.  But the line about how  when you found out  about Heath Ledger's death  and you had to wake up  your son angrily...  Angrily.  I don't know why  that made me laugh.  It really was funny.  There were so many gems yesterday,  but that one line kills me.  You're talking about  how you had to break the news  to your young son  who's a big fan  of Heath Ledger  and how you had to go in  and wake him up  and that story was great.  But wake him up angrily.  I woke him up angrily.  I don't remember  saying it at all.  It was great.  It was fucking hilarious. 
[02:36:30]  But if you missed it  or you want to hear it again,  whatever,  it's gonna happen  right after the live show today.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Yeah, somewhere around 11  or whatever.  All right.  We got  Man Survives ATV Crash  by eating Rotting Beaver.  Rotting Beaver.  I think we could  throw some cunt jokes around.  All right.  You think those  will be available?  You know something.  Could we possibly  segue into some pussy jokes  from eating Rotting Beaver?  You're so subtle  that these things  go right over people's heads.  Could you be  a little more specific? 
[02:37:00]  We decided,  we were gonna play this  on the other side.  We're like,  why would we do that  when we could have  a lot more fun  with this story over here?  And here is a clip  from that story.  He said,  I can smell your cunt.  Okay.  That's wonderful.  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan.  Dan?  Listening on BCN,  by the way.  Oh, okay.  Welcome aboard, Dan.  You know every day  I say that crap.  Yeah.  I know they're listening  on XM,  but I'm just trying  to put it at this hour.  All right, Dan. 
[02:37:30]  What's up?  No, I'm a cop in Boston  and I just want to let you guys  know I was doing a detail.  Probably at like 11 p.m.  and I had the earpiece  in my ear  listening to the replay  of last night's show  and literally had tears  running down my face.  And the perpetrator.  Oh, you had tears?  Oh, yeah.  I had tears running  down my face.  Almost caused accidents  trying to direct traffic.  Oh.  I thought some of the mace  got in your eye. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah,  as you were spraying it  in a person of color's face.  That was a great show.  That's a great show.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dan.  I like to call people  named Dan,  Dan the Man.  All right, we got Eric.  He's in West Virginia.  Strike one.  And he's...  Swing!  Why do I get a crush?  No, I crushed myself.  Oh.  Strike one.  What about the cheeks  of my ass?  And strike two  is the fact 
[02:38:30]  that he's a male nurse.  Oh!  Eric?  Oh.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hi.  You're really a male nurse?  Yeah.  We think that's  the creepiest job  that you can get.  Creepiest job ever.  Yes.  Or the sexiest.  Yeah, it depends  on your point of view.  Male nurse falls  right below  child pornography editor.  Actually,  I can completely agree  with you  depending on  what kind of male nurse  you are.  If you're a male nurse  working in a nursing home 
[02:39:00]  or like  in a pediatric floor  totally creeps me out.  I did cardiac  for four years.  Oh.  So,  I mean,  you know.  When did you realize  you weren't good enough  to be a doctor?  You couldn't pay me  enough to be a doctor.  I'm sure.  Yes, they could.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, they would.  Yeah.  Do you have to wear  a purple little shirt?  No, actually,  I don't work  on the floor anymore.  I'm a rep  for a hospital. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, that's cool.  So, you deal  with drug people.  Yeah.  That's cool.  You don't have to deal  with their fucking whining.  Don't have to wipe  asses anymore.  Good boy.  Yeah.  Did you ever do that  when you wipe  somebody's hiney?  Yeah.  See, to me,  you should just  slap their face  and say,  do it.  Do it yourself.  That's it.  Did anybody ever get hard  like while you were  wiping their asshole?  Like I am listening to it?  No, no.  Not none of that.  Actually, I have had  a few run-ins  with a few women  that were quite creepy, 
[02:40:00]  but they were pretty bad.  Like how?  They were into you?  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  They were not.  You abused them sexually.  You told yourself.  Fess up.  She's crying  because she's so grateful.  She's so into me.  Hey, how about this?  What's the point  of your phone call?  I just wanted to  agree with you  on the mail nurse.  Oh, okay.  He's a mail nurse agreeing.  Chiming in.  Thank you.  By the way,  this old person's makeup  on the pillow  like the Shroud of Turin.  Just crying. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Kevin from Connecticut  has got the order.  It goes mail nurse,  ice cream truck driver,  then high school swim coach.  That's the order  of creepy jobs.  That's pretty creepy.  High school swim coach,  yeah.  I don't know.  Ice cream driver?  I don't know how creepy.  Ice cream truck driver.  Yeah.  Pretty goddamn creepy.  Sure it is.  I don't think  they have a screening process  or you're getting  a lot of pedals.  Oh, whatever you want.  Ice cream trucks.  I'm not a drug dealer.  I guess that's the ultimate van.  It's the ultimate van  trying to get kids into it.  Yeah, for kids. 
[02:41:00]  It's just full of shit  they want.  Yeah, right.  And outside the truck  is everything you want.  Running behind you.  Yeah, running,  chasing you.  They want you.  And their little  cut off jeans.  Ring a little bell  and here they come.  Gajing, gajing,  gajingle, gajing.  Depending on  which way you're looking.  Tasty treats  on both sides of the truck.  Imagine if  he has his dick  sticking out of the trash hole.  A little dragon mouth 
[02:41:30]  where you throw your trash.  Put a wasp lands on it.  You've just got  fucking ice cream  on the tip.  Stupid moving beehives.  I hate those  fucking ice cream trucks.  Dragon hole.  Are there bees around them?  Oh, always.  Oh my God, always.  Sure.  Those delicious sweets.  Let's go to Joe in Boston  listening on BCN.  Hey, boys.  There's an obvious  segue coming up here.  A man fucking  rotting beaver  to a guy eating  rotting beaver.  Yeah, there's your seg.  We're masters  at the radio seg.  Sure are.  With that,  here's the story  about the man  surviving by eating  rotting beaver. 
[02:42:00]  A Canadian man  is recovering tonight  after a 96-hour ordeal  trapped out in the wilderness.  55-year-old  Ken Hildebrandt.  He was collecting  animal traps  when he suddenly  crashed his all-terrain vehicle  and it rolled over on him.  Hildebrandt  survived by eating  raw, rotten meat  and drinking drops  of moisture  that had collected  on some orange ribbons  that he used to  wave to the rescuers.  He also fended off  hungry coyotes  from time to time  with a whistle.  Hildebrandt is suffering  tonight from frostbite,  dehydration, 
[02:42:30]  and may have to have  one of his feet  amputated.  Halitosis.  Jesus.  God, I love you  to fight off coyotes  from time to time.  Yeah.  Every so often,  a coyote would try  and eat his face.  He'd blow a whistle at him.  Yeah.  Coyote's like,  holy shit!  How did he figure that out?  Usually, dogs come  when you whistle.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like,  get away from me!  Blow a whistle  at a coyote.  I know.  You think there was  a lot of boredom  in between the coyote attacks  where you're just  sitting there like, 
[02:43:00]  oh, what am I going to do?  He's waiting.  Ah!  Then back to,  having a hankering  for some rotten beaver.  He's all wrapped up  except he leaves  his one foot out in the snow.  Fucking asshole.  I think that is  a little ironic  that he's a trapper  and he lost his foot.  Yeah.  You know?  It's a little justice.  Oh, is that what he does?  Yeah, he's a trapper  collecting his traps.  Good, fuck him.  Hey, we got to play  the bleep game.  Fuck him.  The bleep game  with this audio.  I think we can make this  a little funnier.  A little saucier.  Here's the man himself.  Well, the harder part  was trying to 
[02:43:30]  shelter yourself  from the weather  because I was pinned  in the wide open  trying to keep the dirt  from blowing in my face  and protect your vital organs  and that sort of thing.  Well, at first  when I was pinned  I tried to get out  so I tried to find  a way to get out  and of course  I couldn't dig my way out  or pull anything.  a quad off of me  so I  had a beaver  that I had trapped.  I started skinning it  but I couldn't skin 
[02:44:00]  the whole beaver  because I had dulled  the knife  that I had  trying to dig in the frost.  How'd you dull it  with your personality?  I skinned the frost  but I laid it down  underneath my groin  and my stomach  so that I would keep  the frost  from my groin  and stomach  because you lose  about 30%  of your body heat  from your groin area.  Is there water  running in the background?  What is this scientist?  Where is he trapped?  Wait a minute.  How long was he out there?  96 hours. 
[02:44:30]  97 hours.  That's four days.  You don't need beaver  after 97 hours.  You don't need  rotting beaver.  Wait what is he trapped in?  It lasts a little longer  before you go into the...  The ATV  all-terrain vehicle  he was on  flipped over on him  and he was trapped  underneath it.  Oh no.  And apparently  he was hungry  quickly  and he has this theory  that you lose  a lot of heat  through your groin.  I've never heard that.  I always heard  wear a hat  because you lose it  through your head 
[02:45:00]  but maybe it's that head.  Yes.  We were always told  maybe the wrong head.  30% of your body  he goes through your dickhead.  So did he put  rotting beaver  down his pants?  Yeah, on his balls?  Well, that's where you put it.  Maggots on your dick.  He just had hot meat  on his cock?  That is just...  What else do you do  with rotting beaver?  Maybe that's why it rotted.  This guy's disgusting.  He's just a fucking  disgusting Canadian.  Have a little patience.  After 97 hours  he's eating  rotting beaver  to survive. 
[02:45:30]  And how does the meat  rot in four days?  Who is he?  Bob Kelly?  Can't go without a...  Oh, sorry Bob.  It's cold enough  to fucking...  You finished it  was going to bomb.  No, I stopped.  There's a problem  with my theory.  It was cold enough  to freeze his foot off.  And yet the beaver  couldn't keep?  Yeah.  This guy just wanted  to eat the rotting beaver.  He just needed an excuse.  Well, maybe it rotted  before he got to it.  Yeah, so he's going to say  what did he bring  rotting beaver with him?  In case I get caught.  I've had ham  for like 30 days 
[02:46:00]  in my fridge.  It was fine.  That's a fridge.  I'm assuming  he had the beaver  because he was  getting the traps.  Right.  So he was collecting  some beaver.  But how would it rot  so fast if it was  cold enough?  Did he lose his foot  to frostbite  or did he lose it  like maybe in the accident  it got fucked up?  Maybe it was sticking out  in the snow.  So then why  did the beaver rot?  Why did the beaver rot?  He probably already  had it on his ATV.  Yeah, but if it was  in the snow or something.  It probably fell  and his little toots  he was sticking out  and bare to the elements.  And now he's fucking 
[02:46:30]  trapping these poor animals  for their pelts  and then he had to eat one.  Good fucko.  That's what you get  working in an office.  You fucking predator.  How is dirt  Jesus.  That's what humans are.  How is dirt  going in his face  if it was snowing?  Yeah, I like that too.  Yeah, this guy's  making no sense.  I had to protect  my vital organs  and keep dirt  from my face.  Yeah, and coyotes.  I wanted to do a queen  in the midst  of having my foot frozen off.  Yeah.  I could blow the whistle  from the coyotes  and my hair  was losing its luster  and pounced. 
[02:47:00]  This guy's just a douche.  And he conditioned my hair.  Yeah, we all hate this guy.  Yeah, we don't like this guy.  Wish he would have lost  his larynx  as well as his fucking foot.  Fucking frozen  Canuck douchebag.  Fuck you.  Alright, we got  trapping those  innocent animals.  They're just scattering around.  Can you see a beaver?  It's a big fucking rat.  Beavers suck, believe me.  It's a rat with a flat tail.  But this guy's a  they build shit.  He's making dams.  You want to go swimming?  You can fucking hire a beaver. 
[02:47:30]  Fuckin' they are  flat tailed zeros.  Beaver teeth.  Beavers, the flat tailed zeros  of nature.  Fan me with your tail,  shit dick.  And then I'm gonna make  a fucking lucky thing  out of your foot.  That's a rabbit.  Whatever it is.  What's the dam all  about there, Jimmy?  Why do you think  a beaver builds a dam?  Is it an OCD thing,  you think?  Yeah, they just  can't handle mess  and they like to  drink their own cum.  So they fucking  arc loads into the water  and then they just  lap it like fruits. 
[02:48:00]  My theory.  It isn't actually a dam.  They build a lodges.  They're called lodges.  And it's a protection.  They go under the water  and they enter the lodge  through the bottom  so that the predators  can't get to them.  So the top of it  sticks out of the water  and it's all sticks  and mud and stuff.  But their access point  is under the water  so when they're in there,  they're safe.  Are they getting wet?  No, there's little places  up in the lodge  where they can sit  and hang out out of the water  or they can be in the water.  Hold on, but more importantly 
[02:48:30]  because I want to continue  with something we started today.  Now, you're very knowledgeable.  You know a lot of this stuff.  Oh, I try.  And I want to know  what horrific memory  from your childhood  has been pushed out  of your brain  so that is in its place.  It could have been  the big, fat,  American Indian woman  trying to rape me  in a barn  when I was about  13 years old  at Jimmy Jackson's ranch.  What?  All right, listen. 
[02:49:00]  We started a new thing today  for the listeners,  the hardcore listeners.  You know,  we all know  that Anthony's very knowledgeable  but it's finally  became quite apparent  that he's filling his brain  with all this useless nonsense  to forget about horrific things  that happened  to you as a child.  Now, you've never told  this story on the air before.  No, I think I did tell it.  It was at Jimmy Jackson's  who was a crazy cowboy out there  when I was living in California.  He used to sell dead horses.  Yeah, he tried to sell people  dead horses and stuff.  He ran a rent string  and I used to run it for him. 
[02:49:30]  Very equestrian part of California.  I lived in San Juan Capistrano.  A lot of horses.  It's where the swallows come back.  Blah, blah, blah.  But there was a party going on there.  Everybody's drunk, of course.  And I went around the back  to the barn  to take a leak  and there was this big, fat  American Indian woman.  And she was kind of in the barn.  And she got a peek  at your monster 12-year-old cock.  And she wanted... 
[02:50:00]  She was a kayak.  Shut up!  She wanted to, as she said,  roll around in the hay with me.  Ah.  And I zipped up pretty quickly  and started getting out of there.  And she was all drunk  and she started rolling  and kind of crawling toward me.  And I think if she got, like,  a hold of my leg,  it would have been over.  Wow.  And the things that scared me the most...  You're going to keep me on your face?  Like, I...  I was hammered at the time, too. 
[02:50:30]  Who knows?  I probably would have fucked her, but...  Rapes and hay.  Yeah.  Got her American Indian name.  Rapes and hay.  Hay squall.  But the thing that scared me  is her husband was there  at the party.  Oh, no.  And he looked like fucking  Billy Bear from 48 Hours.  Oh, no shit.  Just a big Indian with a knife.  And that kind of scared me  that, you know,  he was going to chop me to pieces  and stuff.  So I got out of there.  But that was one of those  horrific memories  that probably shouldn't happen  to a young boy.  How old were you?  14? 
[02:51:00]  I think 13.  She was a big, fat Indian  with little hands.  Like those little Indian hands.  Yeah, little Indian hands.  She had, like, the...  I don't know.  Did you see her naked?  Whole Aztec face.  I don't know what the hell was going on.  The zitty Indian face.  I don't know what it was.  It was, like,  kind of an Aztec flat thing.  And, uh...  No, she wasn't naked.  But she, um...  She was, like,  kind of toying with herself.  Yuck.  Yeah.  I think she was waiting  for anyone to come back there  to take a piss.  Like anybody. 
[02:51:30]  She had nice little hands  for making trinkets.  Trinkets.  Great little hands  for making beaded  dollar-fifty trinkets.  Buffing turquoise.  Yes.  Trying to trade a blowjob  for some bees.  Yeah.  More importantly,  when did you realize  you had a monster cock?  At what age?  Hey!  I just think I'm average.  When did you realize  it was monstrous?  12, 13?  Um, I...  You know,  you just don't know.  You don't think  I've grown compared to... 
[02:52:00]  My God.  Let's talk about your cock  for a few minutes.  You got a big cock.  This is quite embarrassing.  Yeah, I think he does.  I don't talk about my...  My...  The famous wow story  from our Boston days  proves that Anthony  is packing something monstrous.  That was something  that just, uh...  It must have been  perfect timing.  That's right.  I bet Anthony  has a huge...  Just helmet.  Just defined...  Why is the discussion  turned to my dick?  To your monstrous dick?  It's really defined 
[02:52:30]  from his shaft  and then it just goes  spreads out  like a big wild mushroom.  Shut the fuck up.  You think he has  a big thick crown on it?  Oh, a big huge crown.  He has a portabella dick.  Huge portabella.  He's got a play...  He's got a playboy  cartoon cock.  Just a huge...  Just a well-defined...  His pee hole is huge.  Right.  Look, I won't be  party to this.  You could stick like  a half a dollar  in his pee hole.  I don't like  the idea of  Bob Kelly  fantasizing about 
[02:53:00]  my dick.  No, you're monstrous.  Stop.  We're inserting  change into it.  Yes, I know.  What the fuck is it?  I bet it hooks  to the left.  It has a hook to it.  Would you please?  It's not that we're gay.  We're just curious  in a Ripley's  believe it or not  way.  We're not gay,  we're amazed.  Yeah, we...  How many times  has that been used?  We're not gay.  We're just amazed.  Just a male form.  We want to see  the midget,  the bearded lady,  and your monstrous dick.  All for a dollar.  Put your big vein 
[02:53:30]  down the top of him.  Just a huge...  Well-defined veins.  Yeah.  More than one.  Oh, just a huge...  Oh, you motherfuckers.  Fucking vein.  You guys should see  his pulse going in his cock.  It's not a pulsating vein.  What do you think  his bald egg looks like?  Oh, he's got a big,  droopy old man's neck.  I do not!  It actually makes  his dick bigger  because it stretches  out the skin.  Yeah.  A deflated weather balloon.  Everything's very  nice and tight  where he's a  deflated weather balloon.  Like an Area 51 balloon. 
[02:54:00]  It's the thing  that fucking crashed  in Roswell,  but it's fleshy.  It has big fucking  oblong balls in it.  You think he's ashamed  to wear shorts  because of the monstrous  nature of his cock?  I wear shorts!  He has to wear  a jock strap  because his fucking  huge sack  would just sink  out of his shorts.  Why are these fantasies  of Bob Kelly  coming out  that are completely  inaccurate  about my genitalia?  But it's in a  P.T. Barnum way.  Let's just keep it,  you know...  See the man  whose cock  could gag a hippo. 
[02:54:30]  I'm gonna come  down your throat.  You fucking  will better  swallow it all.  I'm coming,  you dumb bitch.  You just stick  five quarters  in his pee hole.  We call him  Jackpot.  Jimmy Jakes  is writing,  Ant's cock  has an elbow  in it.  Is that true,  Anthony?  No!  He's got a joint.  Yeah.  And for the people  that are lingering 
[02:55:00]  longer,  yes, of course.  Show us your  quark!  Thank you,  Kevin,  from Connecticut.  He doesn't trim.  You don't trim  anything down there.  He doesn't have  a femur.  I'm not explaining  my trimming habits  to anybody.  You don't trim  anything.  I don't think  Anthony believes  in that.  How do you know?  That grooming thing.  How do you know?  He trims a little bit  sloppy.  I think he's got  a landing strip.  Which I recently  did to myself.  And it's worked  out well.  You want the  landing strip?  Get your cell phone  and rub it on  your box right now. 
[02:55:30]  Not my box!  Don't I have a box?  I shave everything.  Anybody else?  No, I trim it  way down.  No, you don't  want to look like  a fucking baby.  Jeff from, um...  As a man,  you can't do that.  Women doing that  is fine, but a guy  shaving everything  is a little weird  there, Jimmy.  Jeff from Sacramento  writes,  Was Anthony the  model for the  super bad drawings?  Blue Heeler from  Kentucky, Cloverfield 2,  the attack of the  Kumia car.  You should have  said that to JJ.  You should have  brought that up.  Yes, I could have  starred in the next... 
[02:56:00]  No.  No?  It's, uh...  You're being  inaccurate.  When Anthony  fucking walks naked  around the house  with a heart on,  it's like, you know  that when a horse  does it, it bounces  up and down?  Yeah.  Because there's too  much weight and  it's too long.  Yes.  It just has like a  bounce.  Top heavy.  It's a top heavy  cock.  Have you ever had  a weighty penis  that hits the water  as you're sitting  down to take a dump?  No.  Every once in a while  mine will get weighty  and it'll hit water. 
[02:56:30]  My balls are so big.  The toilet's clogged  and you get flushed.  What do you mean  it gets weighty?  I call it weighty.  It's just like,  it's heavy.  All of a sudden  it's just got a dip.  I piss on my balls.  It goes in for a dip.  I piss on my nuts.  I have really big balls  and sometimes on my...  Or a really horribly  tiny cock.  Both.  I think it's a mixture  of both.  You can't clear your bag.  I can't.  This cock looks like  a spy versus spy bomb.  That was great.  Is it small, Bob? 
[02:57:00]  No.  I have a grow-an  not a shower.  Well, that's what  everyone says  that has a small one.  That's what you tell  the girls.  Just wait now.  Hold on a second.  Trust me on this.  It'll be here in a second.  Two fists and a thumb.  We can all do two fists  if we push down hard enough.  I actually have to  use elastics  to stretch my balls out.  If Bob does two fists,  if you look at the back,  his asshole is pink-socking  because of the pressure.  He's pushing it out.  He does two fists,  but it's Rich Voss's hands. 
[02:57:30]  You ever get a pink sock  when you fuck your girl's ass?  You pull your dick out  and that pink skin grips  your cock like,  get back here, you.  And there's a vein in it.  Enough about the pink sock.  You can hear your asshole  saying, get back here, you.  Get back here, you.  Oh, God.  Why?  Why I ought to...  Here's your cock.  What's your hurry?  Anthony's big helmet.  Oh, all right.  I thought we were done.  All right, listen.  I hold in my hand  the third episode  of 
[02:58:00]  The Inventor  and Epstein.  Oh, wow.  The third installment.  First two stunk.  Well, yeah.  That's why the third.  And TJ has to go.  Why?  Oh, I gotta get ready  for Letterman.  Oh, yeah.  I'll talk to...  That's where they shoot  what I'm gonna talk about.  That is fucking cool, bro.  Enjoy yourself.  Yeah, I'm very, very excited  about it.  We'll see.  Hopefully it'll be...  It'll be fun.  So you're on second  after Julia Louis-Dreyfus?  Yeah, if I can follow that.  I'm sure you'd be  going to follow that.  Yeah.  Do you call it  Jewy Louis-Dreyfus? 
[02:58:30]  Oh.  No, I thought you  called it that.  You're so anti-Semitic.  No, not at all, actually.  Of course you're not.  You're right for a Jew.  Make sure you get  one O.K. Anthony reference  in there.  Yeah, I think that's...  It could go obscure.  And we'll play your set  tomorrow on XM.  Linger Linger Linger.  Oh, thank you.  Very much.  Linger Linger.  That's what we do.  I'll just say  Linger Linger.  Slip in a linger  and slip in a longer.  Somewhere in there.  Yeah, it's going to be good.  Dave will sit there.  Just don't have him  dump ping pong balls  out before you walk out.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:59:00]  Tennis balls.  Was it tennis balls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But thank you guys  so much for having me.  Thank you for coming down again.  As a piece,  should we go to break real quick?  Always welcome.  Might as well take a break.  But I want to tell TJ  what Anthony just did.  He is basically telling you  we were also on Letterman.  No, no, that's right.  Actually, we were trying  to relate to you.  Because you were supposed  to go to tennis balls,  ping pong balls.  What was that about?  Oh, no.  And then Anthony was going to go,  well, when we were on Letterman.  They dropped a bunch  of tennis balls,  which we almost tripped over.  It's quite a story. 
[02:59:30]  I heard that you guys were on.  That was right after  you had been fired  and rehired?  Yeah, it was right after  our firing.  Then we made the biggest mistake  of our careers  because they wanted us back,  but they didn't have  a booking for us.  And then Leno's people  were calling.  You know, look at us, right?  And we wanted to do Leno.  So we went and did Leno  and now Letterman  won't have us back.  Now we're persona non-rotten.  I think that was a mistake, though,  because if they wanted you,  they would have given you  the date beforehand.  I don't think that was  a mistake at all.  That's what we told them  because we're like,  well, then what's the date?  And they're like,  well, sometime in December. 
[03:00:00]  We're like, well,  Leno is giving us  an exact date.  I don't know if we,  did we talk about this  on the air?  And so then we flew out  to Leno, had a great time,  and now Letterman's people  that were pretty hot on us  don't really.  I think we'll be back.  And they got the head writers  that are big fans  of the show, so.  Which is the one  that you went on  where Anthony turned  into a chatty cat  and wouldn't shut his mouth?  Hey.  Anyways, Dave.  Anthony did great.  All I know is  on those shows, 
[03:00:30]  I've watched enough  of them to know  you don't stop  fucking talking.  Yeah, you didn't.  Just start babbling.  Just keep it rolling.  Keep that train rolling.  Watch me go on now  and just fucking  motor mouth.  And by the way,  my advice  was given to me  by Luke Wilson.  If you recall.  So he's the one  I got a punch in the face.  Yes, yes.  He told me.  He told me to go.  Yes.  What did Luke say?  Overcompensate for being 
[03:01:00]  the less talented.  Stupid Luke Wilson.  He told me  to have a couple of beers  and just, yeah.  He goes,  don't drink too much.  He goes,  if you drink too much,  it's going to be worse  than if you didn't  drink anything.  You want to still wear it?  A couple of beers  that will loosen you up  a little bit  and then you feel  kind of like, hey.  And then be very relaxed  and sit down.  And I'll tell you,  the walk between  the wing and the couch  is where you think  you're going to die. 
[03:01:30]  That's the scariest part.  That's the scary part.  But then once you sit down,  it's fine.  If I vomit gin  on the air,  then you'll know  I can thank Anthony.  And Dave goes like,  oh, oh.  Wow, you smell like  Luke Wilson.  Yeah, it's just enough.  Dude, go on  and just really fucked up, man.  Just go on really drunk.  Didn't Andy Dick do that?  Andy Dick went on.  Oh, that guy's crazy.  You never know  what he's going to do next.  I think he went on.  Yeah, he was drunk  on cum.  Yeah, right.  God, if I had enough of him.  We get it.  Somebody said,  you're addicted crazy. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, he keeps getting  caught at gay clubs.  No, he doesn't.  He keeps going to gay clubs.  He goes to them.  Non-stop.  You got another project?  Yeah, I'm going to do  some stand-up at comics  on the 29th of February  and March 1st.  And then I got an offer  for a movie.  So we'll see how that  shakes out.  I love that.  I love how that's  just a great play.  An offer.  Yeah, I know.  I still have to go audition 
[03:02:30]  with like 800 other asses  that look like me.  You know, it's funny though.  Yeah, I get that.  But then also I just found out  like a day or two ago  that I didn't get  the Ready Whip campaign  that I auditioned for.  Oh, damn it.  For Ready Eddie.  Oh, really?  Wow.  The Ready Whip is,  is that like Cool Whip?  The Ready Whip's in the can.  It's in a can.  It's what you do  the Whip it's out of.  Yeah, it's the one  you can do nitrous.  Yeah.  Everybody knows.  It was always my choice  because you get a little high  right before your center.  It's a poor man's crystal meth. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that's right.  But you know what's funny?  I actually prefer the Cool Whip  out of the Tupperware.  How about this, guys?  What's your preference  when we come back?  TJ Miller, always a pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  Does everybody see Cloverfield?  Absolutely, man.  And stop in any time, please.  Good luck tonight on Letterman, bro.  By the way, they love you.  The fans love you on our show.  Oh, that's great.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah, it was a great fucking show.  All right, when we get back,  yesterday we did three stories  in a row about eyes.  Remember that?  No.  Yeah, I do.  I want to see what you do  if I just said no.  Apparently just freeze 
[03:03:30]  like a deer in headlights.  Get me out here, Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  Fuck this broad.  Freeze like a foot  sticking out of an ATV.  Yeah.  And then we got  Jimmy's appendix scar.  Oh, God.  So today...  Mixed with a belt imprint.  Bob is so insulting.  How about that ass?  Oh, my God.  Bob's going to puke...  You can't puke over that.  Stop.  He's got a roid on his asshole. 
[03:04:00]  He just looked right  into Jimmy's asshole.  At a boy.  You really have a roid?  I might have one, yeah.  Yeah.  I very rarely get them.  Clover ass.  What's wrong, Bob?  He's got a nugget on his asshole.  A nugget.  A little roid.  He's got a little calcium  deposit on his asshole.  Have you been pushing  too hard, Jimmy?  No, I probably sit there  for too long.  I love to do a toilet.  Get a bidet.  All right with the bidet.  Nothing about your  fucking robo toilet.  I'll give you 50 bucks  just to spit my asshole  and I'm finished.  Here's your ONA reference.  Here's your ONA reference.  Someone's coming up with it.  This is really good. 
[03:04:30]  Wear one.  One pink sock.  Wear one pink sock.  So when you sit down  on the couch,  obviously the pants  go up a little bit  and there's going to be  a pink sock.  Why would he want to go  on Letterman and do that?  No, no, no.  That's crazy.  Two pink socks.  Gay.  One pink sock.  Something weird is going on.  Weirdo.  Yeah, but people talk  like, why did he wear  one pink sock on Letterman?  That's fucked up.  And when Letterman says,  why are you wearing  a pink sock?  Say, well, that's what  happens when you  fucking ass, Dave.  The asshole grips your cock.  I know, it'll be great  for the Obi-Anthony fans 
[03:05:00]  and then there'll be  this whole gay community  that's like,  doesn't that mean  he likes getting  That's a signal.  That's a signal.  He's a sloppy party bottom.  Beavers, right?  Sloppy party bottom.  His asshole is still  in my brain.  It looks like an old  Italian lady's armpit.  All right, Jimmy's pissing.  Let's take a break.  TJ Miller, Cloverfield,  Letterman tonight.  And when we get back,  oh, following yesterday's theme,  we got three news stories  that have pets involved. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, pets.  So we got three of them.  And they're hilarious.  And we'll play these next.  It's time for another  Obi-Anthony show,  Scream Along.  Shut up, shut up.  Okay, terrific. 
[03:06:00]  The Obi and Anthony show.  Ah, there's some suspicion.  What?  I'm watching Fox News  and they're starting to  kind of look at this  masseuse a little closer.  They're trying to figure out 
[03:06:30]  why she would call  Mary-Kate Olsen  if she knew there was  a major problem  with Heath Ledger.  That was her first phone call.  Not to the paramedics,  not to 911.  It was to Mary-Kate Olsen  who was somehow connected  with Heath Ledger.  Why would you do that?  Why would you do that?  I'm telling you, man,  it's going to come down  to the H.  An O-D on H.  All in.  You think?  You're going all in on that?  All in.  Oh yeah, this story's  going to get really interesting. 
[03:07:00]  Why don't we send  our own guy down there  to kind of snoop around  and see what they can find out?  Dressed like an  oldie-time detective.  We should just send a guy  to snoop around and start...  A film noir detective.  Yeah.  With a fedora.  He needs an assistant, though.  They always have assistants.  Yeah.  He needs a big coat.  Yeah.  Long little...  Long trench coat.  Little trench coat.  I'm telling you.  We should start snooping around  because this is going to be  a biggie  when it comes out.  Have him be like Monk  where he...  I'm not looking at it. 
[03:07:30]  He's not looking at it.  Jimmy just opens up  his ass cheeks  and sticks them in Bob's face.  You have no sense of surprise.  You're standing there  with your ass.  The beauty is  he has no shame.  I don't know what it would...  I couldn't do that.  I just...  I don't know.  He's like,  I don't know what it would take  to make me show my ass  all the time.  Right.  I'm trying to think.  How would I ever be able  to do that?  My question is,  how would you not?  Right.  I love the no shame part  of that whole thing.  Yeah, there is no shame. 
[03:08:00]  There's been a couple times  like I'll be in the bathroom  at the other joint  and I'm like,  I think I'm going to walk out  and just show my dick.  I'm going to pull a Jim Norton  and then I just...  I can't muster it up.  There's nothing...  I just can't.  And he'll open up his ass  to anybody.  And then I'm going to open it up.  And then I'm no shame.  He'll actually just reach  into his ass  and just spread it open  to his fucking immaculately clean  and believe me,  girls love eating my ass, dude.  Seriously.  I hope he just gagged.  Girls love licking 
[03:08:30]  my fucking asshole  even if it's sweaty.  Oh my God.  You have that little nugget on it.  You've got to put something on that.  A little roid?  Yeah, a little roid.  A little bump.  Another reminder,  at 11 we're replaying  the phone call we had  with the psychologist  that was talking about  the Heath Ledger  and how you tell your kids  and stuff.  And during the break,  we were just discussing  other parts of that phone call.  Yeah.  And all the show references  that made it into that thing.  Young Gregorio  got brought in.  Super Kids  and so many things.  And the Ramon, 
[03:09:00]  the return of Ramon.  Jimmy was telling us  it's been a year since Ramon.  I'm guessing, right?  Maybe it's 8 months.  It's got to be one of the funniest bits.  I love Ramon.  It's one of my favorite.  Can I hear it?  I want to hear a little piece of it.  Of what?  Ramon.  It's the funniest thing ever.  I don't know.  What do we got?  We got whatever we played yesterday  for one of the day.  No, it's the opening one.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear this  from yesterday.  I was Steve from Yellowstone.  And it's coming.  Sure it is.  Wow.  And it's very soon.  Wow. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  I think it's probably  ready now.  Yeah.  Okay.  First of all,  we're still speculating  on how we ride.  We don't know that yet.  It's important not  to jump to conclusions.  Okay.  However,  I think that you have to  sit down with your son  and have a conversation.  Hello?  Are you still there?  I am.  I'm really,  I know this is,  this is a really hard thing  for a lot of us to do.  She thought he was crying.  Somebody that,  you know,  he's going to affect yourself.  Ramon!  This boring bitch  makes Ambien 
[03:10:00]  look like methamphetamine.  We don't know  what he's doing.  Ramon!  Accidental chef!  We have one more  quick clip.  We should cut some of this  up for the other side.  We really should.  It's too good.  All right,  go ahead.  Yeah,  it's a difficult...  I am not too sure  how to handle this.  Yeah,  no,  I completely understand. 
[03:10:30]  I know you do.  That's why I'm asking.  What should I do?  Well,  I think...  What's that?  How old is your son?  He's 11.  He'll be 14.  He's 11.  Yes.  And if you're aware  of what's happened,  do you see it on the news?  Yes,  I woke him.  He woke him to tell me.  Well,  I think that...  He was sleeping  and I woke him up  because it was a tragedy  and I don't know  how to handle it.  So I woke him up angrily.  Well,  I think that what's important 
[03:11:00]  for young kids  is how the parents...  He's not very young.  I don't mean to interrupt you.  He's 11.  He'll be 12.  Well,  it's his birthday.  July 19th,  the day after the Joker movie  is released,  which I think is kind of ironic  that the Heath Legger died  and the movie's coming  on the 18th,  his birthday.  Yeah,  no,  I can't understand that.  I think what's important,  though,  is that you model  the behavior you want.  If you're angry  and you're really...  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no, 
[03:11:30]  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  replayed the whole phone call  after the live show today,  so stick around for that.  I got a new favorite part.  Once he goes,  you're still there,  whatever,  and you go,  I,  I am.  Like,  I said,  I am.  I am.  I am.  First,  you said he's 12  going on 14.  You screwed that up.  No,  you're not part of it.  Oh,  did you?  11,  he'll be 14.  He's 11,  he'll be 14.  Oh,  is that fucking funny,  man?  That is just. 
[03:12:00]  I kept laughing,  though.  That's what made it great,  though.  Gotta be the funniest thing.  It's gotta be one of the funniest games.  I was biting my lip  to try not to laugh during that.  Because we had to try to keep it going.  That's so funny.  I woke him up angrily.  Why?  The poor child.  It's his birthday.  I think that's ironic.  The poor child.  You were such a complete ass.  Steve and then there was one of the calls from Roland. 
[03:12:30]  A lot of people are saying,  you gotta admit that she was a trooper.  No,  you don't know what that's all about,  do you?  She was hoping that it was a real interview  and that someone gave a shit about what she had to say.  That's the only reason she hung in there.  She just was hoping.  That first one,  though,  where you try to Ramon,  you start laughing so hard  and she thinks you're getting upset over the situation.  Oh,  yeah,  it's tough,  you know.  You give that fucking 
[03:13:00]  Lou Abbott,  or no,  Bud Abbott,  Lou Costello,  laugh.  Fuck,  I suck.  Hold on.  Let me crap myself.  Hey,  remember the beaver story?  Remember?  Couple of minutes ago,  do you remember we were talking about beavers?  Rotting beavers?  Rotting beavers in heads.  Where's my hat?  So I'm at the trade center  and I talked to the cop,  I said,  where's my hat?  Beep,  beep,  beep,  beep. 
[03:13:30]  Beep,  beep.  About the hat dice,  it's not about you or the fucking hat.  All right,  here we go.  So the rotting beaver,  now we got the bleeps and the beeps in there  and this is what it sounds like.  Oh,  I don't know.  A little different.  Let's see if it's funny.  A little risque.  He was collecting animal traps  when he suddenly crashed his all-terrain vehicle  and it rolled over on him.  Hildenbrand survived by eating  and drinking drops of  Hildenbrand is suffering tonight  from frostbite, 
[03:14:00]  dehydration,  and may have to have his  amputated.  All right,  that works.  Very funny.  Good job,  good job,  good job.  It sounded like his  dick.  Yeah.  That's funny.  He was drinking  cum.  He was eating shit.  God,  we're still in third fucking grade.  Oh,  I know.  What the fuck?  It's just ridiculous.  You know,  I once heard someone say, 
[03:14:30]  aid,  youth is wasted on the young.  And I thought,  God bless you.  God bless.  God bless you.  Doesn't make you nervous though.  Youth is wasted on the young,  Bob.  God bless you,  old timer.  We're going to be 60  and this stuff is still  going to make us laugh.  It's just funny.  He's funny.  We just have no friends.  I had a vision that.  Nobody's going to want to  hang out with us.  No.  They don't now.  I had a vision that our show  would like seg into some  good political discussion.  No.  Instead,  we're still doing shit  that comes to us. 
[03:15:00]  There's no segging  to anything.  Thank God you guys  didn't seg into reviews.  Are you kidding me?  I'm joking.  I'm not joking.  Jimmy,  what is that?  Problem,  Jimmy?  Problem?  What do you got?  It's called  Colon Pure.  Are you on the steroids?  GNC Natural Brand.  Five grams of fiber  preserving dissolves  quickly and easily  because I want a shit  and I want all that stuff  peeled off.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's good for you.  And that's specifically  made to make your shit.  It's called psyllium husk  which is also the name  of my first daughter.  Call her psyllium husk. 
[03:15:30]  It's lovely.  Pour some of that  on your roid  and then light it on fire  like a wound  in the old west.  Okay.  My finger was so close  to crashing you.  What a save.  All right.  The old cauterizing save.  I don't think the guys  are going to be ready  for this but we'll see.  We'll see how good they are.  Oh, but Than's running.  He's going to attempt it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Watch the stretch.  Let's see.  Who's on the line?  It's Mason from Indiana. 
[03:16:00]  What do you got for the show?  You know,  so with the Heath Ledger thing  I heard David Caruso  was the first  at the crime scene.  So he looked over  this lady  and he asked somebody,  you know,  who was this guy anyway?  And the lady said,  you know,  he was the new Joker  in the new Batman movie.  So then David Caruso  kind of looks slowly  to the left  and he takes off  his sunglasses  and he says,  so now the joke's on him. 
[03:16:30]  Right on, Mason.  Right on.  That's fine.  Well, Frank,  now I guess  this case  is going to go  in our ledger.  They don't even have to be good.  No, no.  Of course not.  Suck when he does it.  All right.  It's the third episode  of The Inventor  and Epstein.  Epstein.  Oh.  I thought you were doing one.  Fuck. 
[03:17:00]  Shut up.  Stop.  Cut it out.  Cut the malarkey, bub.  Stop.  Please.  I beg of you.  Easy.  Thank you.  I don't want to play  the other episodes  to get everyone on board,  so could someone explain  this fucking bit  for the people out there?  It's shitty.  Let's play it.  Oh, sorry.  Not even the  Than and Travis  rebuttal?  Oh, where is that?  That's right there.  That's the bottom one.  Oh, we haven't played  that yet, right?  Well, we played it once. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah, okay.  A shame.  Oh, it was memorable.  Let's not forget  Than and Sam  are doing their  fine radio show  this Saturday night.  Yes.  On 202.  The Royal Rumble  presents the  Than and Sam show.  Yeah, I'm hearing  that you guys  got a little sponsor  for your show.  Well, people have known  about my fandom  of wrestling  for quite some time.  Yeah.  And they couldn't wait.  Yeah, they wanted  to jump on board  with Than right away.  Yeah.  Sam looks like  a thundercat. 
[03:18:00]  You said that  last time I was in.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's funny every time.  I don't know, dude.  Every time I see you  remind me of something.  Lionel?  I guess that's it.  It's like an animal  upper lip.  Yeah, Lionel's a good one.  Anthro.  Anthro.  Hey, when you do  your Saturday night show  for 202,  is it sponsored, Bob Kelly?  It is sponsored.  By what?  For the record.  By...  We're the first  corporately sponsored.  No, apparently  I'm not going to go  with that little joke.  Corporately sponsored?  Since Sam got all serious.  Stan?  Stan, fam. 
[03:18:30]  It happens a lot.  Whatever.  The last of the Frohegans.  By the way,  we're going to pass  the inventor and Epstein  it on to you guys.  Somebody said  that shit was lacking  on that one.  What?  Okay.  Oh.  Nice.  Pay attention.  Pay attention, Anthony.  So we got...  Stop playing with  your huge dick.  Fucking real mouthful  that cockiest kid.  I want to put a Mike  muffin right on top of it.  I thought I was done.  I thought I was out 
[03:19:00]  from under the bus.  The head of your cock  looks like Cloverfield,  the monster.  It was said already.  Douchebag, you pay attention.  It was actually said  about me, douchebag.  I look like that one.  So the head of my cock  looks like you.  My proxy.  Hey, by the way...  Can you hit the button  for me, please?  No.  I'm very bothered  by this instant feedback.  Stephen has from Bayshore  in yesterday's rundown.  He does the fine rundown  at onaradio.com.  I try to caption  the pic of Heath  as the Joker 
[03:19:30]  with the jokes on you.  But I was asked  to change it.  Why?  I also had to change  the heading of the story  from Brokeback Coffin  to Newsflash.  Brokeback Coffin?  Why the fuck  do they have a problem  with that?  Because they're not  fine people.  And we don't even have  a boss over there.  Who's telling you  to do this shit,  Stephen S?  Wait for the delay?  That's all right.  Whatever.  All right.  Delay.  So we got the star.  One, one thousand,  two, one thousand.  Hold on.  Three, one thousand.  We got the star  of The Inventor 
[03:20:00]  and Epstein.  Epstein?  Epstein.  Epstein.  I got it right for one.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  What is this dumb bit about?  Well, that's not  how I would describe it.  Well, just describe  the series first of all  to get everyone on board.  You know.  The premise is there's  a brilliant inventor  who's confined to a wheelchair  and is a very sweet old man  who lives in a castle  with his assistant  whose name is Epstein  who, he wears a 
[03:20:30]  Captain Caveman outfit  that's too short  and sits on the floor  and plays with his  massive testicles  all day long.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Epstein is his assistant  but Epstein doesn't do  much help.  No.  He ends up  a lot of the time  shoving the inventor's  great inventions  when there's only  one of them  in his ass.  But what's the catchphrase?  Well, it's in his hiney.  I don't want to steal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't want to steal.  I'm not Epstein.  I'm the inventor. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Ah.  So I don't want to steal.  I don't know where Epstein  is right now but  I'd like to meet him.  Can we talk to him?  Hopefully on the business  end of a shotgun.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  All right.  Well, let's see  what's going on  in episode three.  Epstein.  Epstein.  Oh.  Cover your genitals  and come see  my new creation.  It's a beverage container  that will keep  liquids chilled 
[03:21:30]  for up to  17 hours.  I see.  Very interesting.  But have you filled out  a patent application?  Yes, of course.  I just got the forms  back from the attorneys.  But I can't imagine  why you bring that up.  There is absolutely  no entertainment value  to be found  in such a trivial process.  In fact,  drawing attention...  Look, you motherfucker.  Oh, man.  You didn't explain this right. 
[03:22:00]  Well, you...  This is based on...  That's what I was saying.  What the fuck?  Yes.  We have to play this first.  You asked for the concept  of the series, I thought.  All right.  Well, there's something  else going on  because not everybody  is on board with this.  Yes.  Up to speed.  So you got the inventor  in Epstein.  Yes.  And you got things  being shoved up  pineys and stuff, right?  Right.  Inventions being  shoved up pineys.  And then and Travis  decided that they needed  to comment on this whole bit. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, and kind of mock it.  And mock it.  Because it's not funny.  Right.  It's kind of what  they were saying.  Yes.  There's kind of a bit war  going on right now.  Bit war, right.  It's a bit war.  All right.  And you were kind of  hearing a rebuttal  to Stan and Travis' version.  And now I got to go  way back.  Wow.  So now here's an episode  of The Inventor at Epstein.  Oh, you're going back  two times.  You have to.  Because this will set up  Stan and Travis  and what they were getting at.  And then you guys  are responding to that. 
[03:23:00]  It's kind of a bit war  going on here.  So here's episode two  of The Inventor and Epstein.  Epstein, stop playing  with your testicles  and look what I've done.  This conveniently shaped vial  contains an elixir  which will increase  the metabolism  of anyone who drinks it.  Can you imagine?  This could eliminate  the worldwide obesity epidemic 
[03:23:30]  permanently.  No.  Let me see.  No.  Well, I suppose  if you're careful  there's just the one  and...  Say.  This would fit perfectly.  In my hiney.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's in.  It's in my hiney.  Well, at least it's still intact.  Now, give it back. 
[03:24:00]  Here you go.  No.  Like a missile.  My elixir.  It's all over the ceiling.  Epstein, you.  You.  Well, back to the drawing board,  I suppose.  Oh, my God.  Gino from Philly writes,  Bit war.  More like a boar war. 
[03:24:30]  And then he writes,  Laddle doodle.  Laddle doodle.  That is awful.  I just...  I don't get the  mine hiney thing.  It's just an excuse  to say mine hiney.  Mine hiney.  So that's how the episodes go  where it ends up  something is being  shoved up mine hiney.  Yeah.  So then Than and Travis decide,  fuck this.  This thing needs  a bit of mocking. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  So they came up with this.  Dr. Thomas,  I have made a most  interesting discovery.  Do tell Dr. Hoffman.  I have unlocked the secrets  to the human immune system.  Fascinating.  What have you found?  This vial contains  the cure for cancer.  May I see it?  Here you go.  I have a whole vat  of the stuff.  It's so smooth  and compact. 
[03:25:30]  It's just a standard  test tube.  I was thinking  that I could...  What?  File a patent  with the Food  and Drug Administration?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  I hate paperwork.  No problem.  Uh, cool.  So, back to the drawing board.  See, you were expecting  it to end up  in his Mein Heine thing.  Mein Heine,  but all he did  was legitimately  patent the product.  Mocking  the inventor  in Epstein.  The assistant  helped him out 
[03:26:00]  as he should have,  doing the proper procedure  instead of taking it  and putting it in  Mein Heine.  And I won't shoot  Sam's rebuttal  in the foot.  I'll just wait  until after it's played.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Well, now, yes.  The inventor in Epstein?  Yes.  Yes, that's right.  Okay.  Uh, this is, yes.  Their rebuttal.  Epstein!  Epstein!  Cover your genitals  and come see  my new creation.  It's a beverage container 
[03:26:30]  that will keep  liquids chilled  for up to 17 hours.  I see.  Very interesting.  But have you filled out  a patent application?  Yes, of course.  I just got the forms  back from the attorneys.  But I can't imagine  why you'd bring that up.  There is absolutely  no entertainment value  to be found  in such a trivial process.  In fact,  drawing attention  to such a droll, 
[03:27:00]  monotonous procedure  is causing me  extreme fatigue.  Don't bring it up again.  May I these forms?  Well,  I haven't signed them yet,  but I suppose...  These would fit perfectly.  In Mein Heine?  Go ahead.  I'll just get more.  Loyalists make copies  of everything.  At least I still have  the liquid cooling container.  Oh, no!  How did you get that?  Ah,  this too would fit perfectly. 
[03:27:30]  Give that back.  In Mein Heine?  Epstein,  stop!  Almost!  Stop!  No!  Almost there!  Oh, no!  Pushing!  What?  I need that!  Hooray!  It's in Mein Heine!  Right.  Well,  back to the drawing board  I spilled.  Yes.  How does he get  all these objects  up his anus? 
[03:28:00]  I don't know why,  but it makes me laugh.  You got a double shot  that time.  A double shot?  He said Mein Heine  like five times  in that one.  Yeah,  fan?  Just,  why not just say  Mein Heine the whole time?  Yeah.  Just cut to the chase  and do a  Mein Heine montage.  It's like an SNL bit  that isn't funny,  but they keep doing  the same catchphrase bit.  Yeah.  I, uh,  I'm not, uh,  feeling the Mein Heine bit.  And the,  obviously the point 
[03:28:30]  was that filing a patent  is not entertaining.  We weren't like,  move over, folks!  We got something awesome  that's gonna set  the world on fire!  It was just to present  that there's more  than one thing  you can do  with an invention  besides stick it up  somebody's ass.  And also,  quickly,  just to plug  the Than and Sam show,  we'll be playing  zero of these bits.  Oh!  No, that's true.  Oh, yeah.  We won't play  even one.  All right,  Than and Sam,  Saturday night.  Very excited.  And of course,  if Dr. Whoever 
[03:29:00]  and what's-his-name  have a,  have a comeback  for the, uh,  the inventor  in Epstein,  you're more than welcome.  Okay, thank you.  I think I might do  the show,  the listeners,  if I know  the boss is the favor  and not do one.  I think if I know Than  and I do a little bit,  I think he made his point.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all about  making his point  and that's it.  He doesn't...  Well, I guess you're right.  He's ready to admit defeat.  Oh! 
[03:29:30]  How many, um,  how many sound effects  you got left  where you can't do  any more of these bits?  Oh, no, these are...  See, I liked how you  incorporated in  the jackhammer this time.  Yeah.  These are recorded live.  Those aren't sound effects.  Oh, oh, okay.  It's really happening.  Yeah, we actually  have to shove stuff  in Steve's ass  to get the design.  Oh, Steve?  Well, you're breaking character.  What do you have  to pull out first  to get the new stuff  to fit?  An igloo cooler.  Wow.  Those are big and square.  Yeah, exactly.  Like Steve.  God damn it! 
[03:30:00]  Good one.  He saved you, Steve.  Did he really?  Anthony did, yeah.  Thanks, yeah.  I'm trying.  Okay.  Hey, can we get this  intern backing drive?  I need something.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What?  I'll wait till after.  What?  No.  I'll ask you after.  Don't.  Uh-huh.  I wanted to know  if you could get me  a cup and a teaspoon.  He's just a boy.  We shouldn't ought to 
[03:30:30]  hear stuff like that.  Mm-hmm.  Putting things in mine.  Working over  at Bill Cox's outfit,  fixing lawnmowers,  and whatnot.  What's your favorite food, dude?  Potty meat.  French fried potatoes.  Potty meat.  Peckers.  Peckers.  It's a little loud. 
[03:31:00]  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  I'm good.  What's your name, man?  Brian?  Brian?  We're still doing  the other thing, right?  Are you a new guy?  I'm new.  The Epstein.  Just started last week.  Last week?  Last week.  What do they got you doing?  Take a seat.  Take a seat?  He's sitting down.  Yeah.  What do they got you doing?  Bagels, coffee,  instant feedback,  usual stuff.  Usual stuff.  Yeah.  For what?  For you guys.  Oh, for us, okay.  I always say the usual suspects.  You're like, who's that? 
[03:31:30]  And I'm like, you know,  the usual suspects.  We're like, oh, we know who that is.  I love that.  When did you realize that  you weren't going to learn  anything about radio  and you were going to be a waiter  for the Opie and Anthony show?  A waiter?  You're a fucking Opie.  Jesus Christ.  Coffee, please.  Coffee.  That's not true.  I feel bad for these interns.  We got this great intern program  and we fucking,  we prepare them  to work at a restaurant.  Yeah.  They learn nothing  about the equipment  or the show.  These guys are running 
[03:32:00]  in and out of the building  with food orders  all morning along.  They don't learn a thing  about the show,  radio in general.  We like to say  you take out  what you put in.  Right.  So put in a smoothie  and take out  the empty cup.  It's unbelievable.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  Thank you.  I needed a cup  for eight ounces  of fluid  and a teaspoon  so I could take  my psyllium husk.  Time for big boy's asshole  to start working.  You got it.  Hey, Jimmy,  is Roland still around?  I forgot. 
[03:32:30]  We were going to do  the UFO thing.  All right.  Is he here?  Bring that fucking,  bring that monumental  flop in here.  There's a photo  on Mars.  They might have saw  a person on Mars,  like a creature on Mars.  Stop it.  I swear to God,  on the internet,  they're actually discussing you.  Oh, stop it.  Actually,  it looks like Bigfoot,  but I swear to God.  It's on,  they have a photo  on Mars  and it looks like a...  No, they don't.  There's the face on Mars,  which is bullshit.  Yeah, it's just the way  the shadows hit.  This is not a face.  This is actually 
[03:33:00]  looks like somebody...  Is it the glass watch?  Has the yay come  to the different planet?  Google it.  Google what, Bob?  Google Mars.  Mars monster?  Dude walking.  Mars.  Mars monster.  A planet will run in  and look at a bunch  of equipment  that needs fixing.  I don't know.  Yeah, well...  It was Mars.  That was a good one.  I...  Roland?  Yes?  Unfortunately,  this is going to be  a little uncomfortable for you.  That's right.  I have to trust.  Roland hands out 
[03:33:30]  DVDs of, you know,  shows that are coming on TV.  Hits and misses.  Oh, he's already backpedaling.  Hits or misses?  And movies.  Hits and misses.  And our job is to...  Our job is to check out  this stuff at home  and then decide  if we want to, like,  you know,  help the show along  and promote it, right?  Yes.  Well, you gave Jimmy what?  UFO hunters?  Jimmy?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  And I said...  I got home last night  and I said to my girl,  I like UFOs.  And she said,  I don't believe in them.  I said, well, hun, 
[03:34:00]  we've got a show to watch.  So we sat down  and we popped in  the premiere episode  of UFO hunters.  Yes.  And I'm like,  maybe they'll have some footage.  But instead,  they concentrated  on the case  before Roswell  in 47,  which means  there's no footage  or photos.  Nothing.  No crash scene photos.  And they weren't even  showing the investigation  in real time.  These guys were just  kind of reenacting  their reactions.  Oh, no.  Thank you.  Give me a bigger cup. 
[03:34:30]  Thank you.  I asked for one  that could hold  fucking eight ounces in.  What is this?  I'm not being a dick.  I'm taking psyllium husk.  I need my asshole  to pee all the layers  of shit.  Can I say that  on CBS tomorrow?  Yes.  I'm going to say that  for this one.  So he's now got to go  and get you another cup.  I'm not even busting  his balls.  He's learning.  I think there's eight ounces.  There's eight ounces?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know, Bob.  What are my hands?  What's face  aggravates me?  Why?  It's like the middle  of it just stopped growing. 
[03:35:00]  I'm an ass.  That's brutal, bro.  I always catch myself  just getting lost  in his face.  Just staring at it.  Yeah.  It really is.  Well, we all ran  out of steam, didn't we?  Well, no.  All right.  UFO hunters.  Oh, okay.  Terrell, what do you know  about this show?  Still coming to my cog.  It won't stop.  Of course they are.  Speaking of UFOs,  unidentified fat objects.  Unbelievably would have  been funnier if I  thought that was good. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, yes.  Why would I just keep  eating and drinking?  So Jimmy doesn't like  UFO hunters.  That's going to be on  the History Channel.  No.  I don't like AIDS.  I hated UFO hunters.  I don't like cancer deaths  or crib death.  I hated UFO hunters.  So there was nothing  exciting, mysterious,  kind of like,  wow, that's cool,  or what?  Hey, look at that picture.  The exciting part  would be the credits  and the mysterious.  The credits.  The critics.  Yes, credits and critics.  Yes, those are when  they name all the critics 
[03:36:00]  at the end.  I didn't even fuck up.  All the critics.  The critics.  And the exciting part  was the, I don't know.  I watched half of it.  I didn't like it.  Half of it?  Maybe the second half  was so good.  All they were doing  was rehashing the same  fucking shit.  I hate that.  Over and over.  The second half,  they showed the actual footage.  What actual footage?  I don't know.  I haven't seen it.  He just lied.  He just lied.  They found nothing out.  We would have heard  about it before.  Yeah.  These fucking shit dicks.  I actually,  somebody said something  on the news.  He goes,  if they're UFOs 
[03:36:30]  and they're, you know,  from another planet,  why do they need lights?  If we land planes  with night vision  and we don't need lights  anymore because we have  NOGs,  and they have these ships  that can travel  through the galaxy,  why do they need  light bulbs?  Why are they lit up  all the time?  Perhaps it's part  of the energy source.  Yeah,  maybe the energy.  They don't need light bulbs.  Or maybe they can see  each other.  No,  you don't think  they have like  NOGs,  like, you know,  night vision.  But perhaps the lights  aren't lights 
[03:37:00]  so they can see things  or people can see them.  Maybe it's a part  of the power source.  The propulsion system  is glowing.  Well, no,  it's not like  it's a big red ball  behind it.  It's always  Sometimes it is.  It looks like  a couple light bulbs  around a faucet.  Sometimes.  And maybe they do  see each other at night.  Those are the ones  we don't see.  I'll bring in the third case.  Ah, maybe they're  all over the place  and you just don't see them  because they're using  their eggnogs,  like you fucking like  to say three fucking times  with your nog.  Right, enough of your nog.  I didn't say eggnog.  Enough about the nog. 
[03:37:30]  It's because you hit prestige,  y'all.  I fucking know everything.  I hit prestige.  Why don't we get rid of rolling?  This ain't working.  I always wanted to talk  about this thing,  but we don't mean to be,  you know?  Yeah, I'll bring in  the Dark Knight tomorrow.  Anything else?  The Dark Knight,  the Batman one.  You have it?  Yeah, I'll bring it for you.  Why wouldn't you have  brought that yesterday  and left UFO hunters  at home?  Well, I have like  my own copy.  Wait, you have  the Dark Knight?  Not the new one.  The new one,  no one has.  Oh, I don't want to.  The first one needs to have  Batman Begins.  Batman Begins.  Oh, thank you.  You should watch that. 
[03:38:00]  I think you would like that.  No, not the new one.  I get tired of the movie.  I want Adam West.  Will you be giving out  the Loch Ness Monster?  Is he in Arizona?  Will you be giving that out?  It isn't.  It would be just as exciting.  Yes.  London Bridges.  Yes.  The Yeti.  Is he working at Walmart?  Fucking,  the Abominable Snowman's a cunt.  Roland has the posture  of a Yeti. 
[03:38:30]  All right, here's...  Roland's the Abominable Showman.  Here's a sweeper from Roland.  Oh.  Hello?  Here's my cousin.  Wait!  It's Abominable Cousin Thursday.  I'll be dancing it.  Wow.  Good stuff.  It was fast moving.  A lot of...  Well, we're starting...  Good stuff.  We're doing theme days again.  We got, what?  Wednesday is...  Sunday at Carvel.  No, Wednesday is  Sarcastic Douche Day.  Sarcastic Douche Day. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  And Thursday is  Fuck Your Cousin Thursday.  What?  Yeah.  Why?  It has begun again.  Why?  We start all over with that.  Do we have time  to do our theme news thing today?  We got three stories about pets.  Hope so.  What do you like to hear about...  Story about kids and pets.  Goddamn dog death dedication.  What do you like to hear about  the drill and the dog?  The drill and the dog  from Disney. 
[03:39:30]  Right.  The drill and the dog.  Uh...  Legless chihuahuas.  Ugh.  The douchebags.  Or...  Cattail in the mailbox.  Mmm.  Let's talk about Anthony's cock.  Cattail in the mailbox.  That would be giant snake  in the mailbox.  Fucking clipped snake.  Fat crowned snake  in the mailbox.  Fat crowned.  You think he has...  Fucking thick crowned.  You think he has...  Lickable head.  What?  I'm sorry. 
[03:40:00]  I'm sorry.  I was just...  Why does it keep coming back to this?  You think he has to take in  extra calories every day  just to keep his cock well fed?  Of course he does.  That's why if he was out  in the freezing cold,  the vital organs,  his cock would stay toasty warm  and his head would freeze off.  I think that's why Anthony  has never been fat  because...  Why is this?  Because, you know,  all those extra calories  are being used  by the monstrous cock.  The monstrous...  Old shiitake cock.  Old Nessie dick.  Why?  Big fucking... 
[03:40:30]  Big fat hunk of meat  you call genitals.  Big lucky devil.  And I don't mean you,  I mean your girl.  Forget not hold that monster.  This should just...  Have run its course.  Your cock has a handle.  It doesn't have a handle.  So it folds up,  goes in its own alligator bag.  A bag made of alligator skin  which holds that giant appendage.  I bet you in a weird way too  he's ashamed of it.  Like he gets embarrassed.  Because when he was a little boy  they would call him  Big Wee Wee Anthony. 
[03:41:00]  Big Wee Wee Anthony.  Special swim...  Special swim trunks  for Anthony as a child.  They kicked him out of Little League  because his cock  was too manly and mature.  Shut up, Legal League.  But it would stick out  both sides of the cock.  What are you going to do?  His boyish dick  was always getting hit  with ground balls  because his ball bag  and helmet would stick  out of the sides  of the fucking...  He couldn't get a cup.  I had to go  to the adult cup section.  Yeah, he had to play  the outfield  because he couldn't get down  on those ground balls 
[03:41:30]  because his cock  would kind of trip him up.  He'd squat down  and his fucking cock  and balls would bulge out  like he was having  a miscarriage  in his fucking  baseball uniform.  He looked like a tranny  in the outfield  becoming bent down.  Come on.  Poor Anthony.  How could we possibly  keep this subject  going any longer?  You would think  it would be a blessing  but I think in his case  it wasn't a blessing.  It was a lot of shame.  It was a lot of shame.  A lot of shame involved.  Even when the first girls  when he showed it to them  they'd go,  ooh,  he'd go,  yeah, I know,  I'm sorry. 
[03:42:00]  No, no,  it's a good thing.  I'm sorry.  Just a lot of hair.  Oh yeah,  it was awful.  Way before the days  you learned  you could trim  that shit down a little bit.  He wanted the hair  to grow longer  so it would look smaller.  He would always wear  like bulky  like fucking  like bulky  winter pants  in the summer  so the pants  came out farther  and that fucking  and that hunk of meat  dangling  from the front  of his torso  looked more normal.  His cock 
[03:42:30]  had to get  its own flu shot.  right in the crown.  He didn't even flinch.  Not he didn't flinch  at all.  This never gets  fully hard  because it's too big.  There's not enough  blood in his body  to just fill  the whole thing.  Every time  he gets a hard on  he goes pale.  I do not.  His head gets smaller  when his dick gets hard. 
[03:43:00]  What am I,  a balloon?  People.  Right.  Right.  Fucking  just a fat helmet.  Giant fat crown.  Just a huge crown.  Well pronounced crown.  It's well pronounced  and it is jeans  through thick dungarees.  Dungarees.  You can see the crown  through fucking  two pairs of wranglers.  Like magnum P.I.  How much cum  do you think  comes out of this  monstrous cum?  It's probably  an embarrassing  amount of semen.  He actually used  to jerk off 
[03:43:30]  on a girl's face  and then try to  not finish cumming  because she'd go  oh my god.  I'm going to drown.  Yeah.  I've never seen  this much cum.  Are you sick?  What the fuck  is wrong with you people?  What's the thing?  I'm just trying  to sit here  and do a show.  He had to carry  a measuring cup  so he could  cum in that  and fill it  and dump it  out the window.  Just loads of cum.  How embarrassing.  Filling up  poor girl's eye sockets  with load.  He's just got to  jerk off  every five minutes 
[03:44:00]  to get rid of the poison  that just keeps  producing  and producing  and producing.  When he comes  in a girl's mouth  Anthony's what they call  a three swallower.  He gives you  three fucking mouthfuls  and you gotta swallow.  It's like eating  fucking smooth chowder.  It sounds like  the girl's in a  beer drinking competition.  She's swallowing  his dirty huge load.  You can actually  see his sperm  like tampons.  Are we done?  They're like fucking  eels.  You want to make  a fucking sushi. 
[03:44:30]  His sperm  is actually  not even clear.  It actually has  like a color.  Like a gray color.  When he comes  in this...  Alright, good.  It's finally over.  Thank you, Paul.  We'll start it back up.  We'll start it back up.  Absolutely.  When he comes  it looks like  a snake  trying to swallow  a mouse.  It looks like  he took a garden hose  and filled it with milk.  He's trying to fucking...  I bet you  he can come  without touching it.  Like when he gets close 
[03:45:00]  it probably just stands up  it's very turgid.  And the fucking...  It just starts pumping  on its own  and little bits  start leaking  over the top  and he has to  just grab it.  And it's slick  with pre-cum.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear that.  There you go.  There's his cock.  It's just a fat cock.  It probably just has  to continue  regenerating itself.  What is it now?  Pieces are just missing  from all the... 
[03:45:30]  all the goodness  it gets.  Let's assure you  there's no pieces missing.  His cock actually  sheds once a month.  Pieces fall  off of the space shuttle.  And it keeps on ticking.  He has cock skin  skins around his house.  Like fucking  one of those little bugs  that curl up and shit.  Oh, man.  I feel happy.  I feel happy.  How are you, Jesus?  Hi, hi, hi.  Let's do the line of the day.  Sure.  Who gives a shit  about the pets?  Especially when he shakes  his big fat cock  it sounds like a cicada. 
[03:46:00]  Old cicada genitals.  When he comes  it makes a noise.  People are suggesting  actually  I don't have a name  on this  that the reason  you drink a lot  is because  your cock  is your designated drinker.  He has a heart  on a wheel lock  so he can't  start the car.  Yeah, his dick  is the club.  This could be 
[03:46:30]  the worst thing  I've ever drunk.  Cillium husk.  Why would you think  it tastes good?  But it could be  the worst thing  I've ever drunk.  Makes you like  shit.  Dude, Metamucil.  It's easy.  I was farting so bad.  I kept saying  Metamucil in the house  when I was in the car  with Kenny.  I gassed him  all the way  to fucking Atlantic City.  Kenny was saying  how awful that was.  I don't know  if we talked about it  on the air  but he said  your farts  going down  to Atlantic City  were the worst ever.  Kenny wants to bully people.  That's what he gets.  By the way,  I'm fine-tuning  my formula 
[03:47:00]  for the fart off.  I discovered  it was broccoli  that did it to me  yesterday.  Oh.  So we're going  to have a gas contest.  You want in, Bob?  I'd love to.  I'm dead serious.  I'm dead fucking serious.  We're putting a day aside.  Okay.  And we're just going  to try to see  who the last man  standing is.  Now there's two ways  you can go.  The fart noise  and sound  or the smell?  The smell.  I'm thinking  we might have  to have  somebody that has...  Now if you shit  your pants  you'd disqualify. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, sure.  Not at all.  Absolutely.  You can't have shit  outside of your ass.  She can.  I think we'll be laughing  so hard  that I don't think...  The only person  that will leave  no doubt in my mind  will be Anthony.  So we've got to get  somebody,  a couple people in here  that will determine  how awful  these farts are.  Yeah.  You've got to get some...  Are you in really?  Danny's in.  I'll definitely do it.  Jimmy's in, obviously.  When is it?  What's your formula?  I'm going to have  to have fajitas  from the certain place  that I get them from. 
[03:48:00]  Sure.  And I'll have to have  some garlic.  Garlic.  Oh.  Oh.  Jeez.  It sounded like  a percolator.  It sounded like  you were a chemist.  A chemist?  A chemist?  A chemist?  A chemist?  A chemist?  From me?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to set aside  a day for the fart off.  What's the sound  Anthony's cock makes  when it comes?  All right.  Enough about the cock.  Cock gurgles. 
[03:48:30]  Your cock hole  has lips like a muck.  Your little bum chin  on your dick.  When Anthony comes,  it sounds like  pea soup  being dumped  on tinfoil.  Got to put tarp up  all over the place  because he doesn't want  to mess up  his brand new drapes.  Just shooting everywhere.  Looks like a  Night Stalker murder scene  with delicious cum.  He's got a focus  or it just goes off  like a garden hose  after you turn it on.  Looks like somebody  had a pie fight.  Yeah.  Next Thursday, 
[03:49:00]  BulldogLife.net  presents Cherry Darts  and we're still looking  for couples.  Fucking awful.  A lot of fucking people  are like,  hey, bring back  the old bits.  So we bring back  the old bits  and no one comes  to the table to do it.  So we're looking  for couples for Cherry Darts.  $2,500 up  for grabs.  Email Travis  at FoundryMusic.com.  Okay, please.  We're trying to bring back  some of these old bits  you know and love  and so far  no interest.  Also,  that great phone call 
[03:49:30]  that Jimmy did yesterday  with a psychologist  talking about Heath Ledger.  We're replaying that  in a few minutes here.  Also, people are asking for,  I've got to ask E-Rock,  the NRA restaurant bit.  Oh, yeah.  Have we played that  in a while?  A fave that was.  We've played it  over the holidays.  Not in a while?  No?  Okay.  Can we squeeze it in today  or that might be tough?  Alright,  if we don't squeeze it in today,  we'll squeeze it in tomorrow.  Okay?  With that,  let's do  line of the day.

[03:50:00]  and up to the minute  snow conditions.  Log on to  SkiColoradoNow.com.  The worst thing  I've ever drank  is silly musk.  You really don't like that.  Can I taste it?  When I'm done, yeah.  I'll give you some.  Out of his ass.  That's what comes out of  Anthony's cock,  psyllium husk.  All right.  Pure psyllium husk.  Fucking Bobby.  Someone wants to know. 
[03:50:30]  Chris asked from PA.  I didn't pay attention  to the instant feedbackers today.  I apologize,  but I just caught this one.  Chris asked from PA,  he writes,  when it turns off  in the toilet,  how many times  does he have to flush?  Ow.  Fuck.  I keep breaking  a rubber band  around my face.  All right.  Here's a runner-up  line of the day.  Every time he gets 
[03:51:00]  a hard-on,  he goes pal.  Late entry.  Yeah, late entry.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Another runner-up  line of the day.  Oh, I don't know, Bob.  I don't remember.  What's face  aggravates me?  Why?  It's like the middle  of it just stopped growing.  Where's it going?  That was good.  We've all thought it.  No one said it.  So why did we do  four hours and 50  months and five minutes  of radio?  Didn't have lines  of the day.  Apparently the whole 
[03:51:30]  first part was no good,  but apparently Big  Laughs came  in the last couple minutes.  Who are we to say?  No, we are the judges.  We're rolling the jury.  Get him.  Another runner-up  line of the day.  Oh, okay.  He's a male nurse  agreeing.  Chiming in.  Thank you.  By the way,  this old person's  makeup on the pillow  like the Shroud of Turin.  Just crying.  That was great, dude.  What the fuck  did you remember  that name?  That's nice.  Shroud of Turin.  Um, I don't know 
[03:52:00]  what this is.  Psyllium husk  makes a boy  go doody.  That's a song  I'm working on.  Let's go to Keith  in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to know  when Anthony comes  if his dick  looks like a dead  person being  revival paddles.  Good one.  That, um...  God.  Yeah.  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  Just please walk away.  Jesus.  That was a psyllium husk  of jokes.  Let's go to South Dakota.  Thank you. 
[03:52:30]  What?  Hold on.  That got what it deserved.  I heard Anthony  makes his girl  wear arm floaties  when she sleeps  in the wet spot.  That is funny.  That is funny.  You know,  how did we get here?  I don't know.  Your genetics.  I don't mean that.  Huge cocked  Italian asshole.  Can you actually  swim and cum?  Uh...  No.  Not me.  Or you'd just float.  You'd probably float  due to the  sodium content. 
[03:53:00]  High salt.  It would be like  the Great Salt Lake.  Mark B. in Ohio,  Ant's Cock was  attacking ships  in Pirates of the  Caribbean too.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's all right.  Someone has to shit.  Do you wash  your cocks separately?  You have to stay  in the living room  while it's in the shower.  Soap it up.  Singing.  And he...  I want...  All it can do  is whistle. 
[03:53:30]  And he's  here's when he gets  soap in the pee hole  so he puts the  fucking cork  from a wine bottle  in it.  He actually puts...  Jesus Christ,  Jimmy.  Steve Elsbury  from Albany  writes,  when Anthony  says cock  looks like  Pat from  Monaki  in the  Baby Bird  video.  People are  fucking ruthless.  I want to thank  Uncle Nuts T-Con  from Indiana, 
[03:54:00]  Matt LaFaugh  from Queensbury,  Squarehead  from Jersey,  Booby Man  from Brooklyn,  Mark B.  from Ohio,  Donnie B.  from Allentown  and Barry Rye.  And Ted  from Schenectady  from Pittsburgh.  Why?  Why?  Why?  That's why Anthony  has so many guns  in case his cock  fucking just goes  ballistic one day.  I'll shoot it?  Is that what you're  implying?  I have to shoot it?  Starts leaving  Darth Vader  helmet prints  all over the house  on the walls.  Starts waking up  and doing things 
[03:54:30]  while you're asleep.  Yeah.  You hear slapping noise  and he's like...  It attacked a neighbor  one night  while you were sleeping?  Well,  now it's getting  ridiculously big,  isn't it?  It's sneaking outside.  It's doing things.  Who doesn't love  exaggerated humor, though?  I have to shoot it.  Exaggerated humor rules.  I'll say it does.  It's coming like  a fat man  vomiting up eggnog.  That's wonderful.  He can't even  wash it properly.  I bet your aunt's cock  by the head 
[03:55:00]  smells like  the underside  of a foot.  Oh, God.  Use lead bag  from my whack bag  and shits out peanuts.  Peanuts  as his cock  constantly tries  to feed it.  Showing hay  up his own ass.  That fucking...  That gift.  With that fucking  fleshy gift.  Cog looks like  an old sea turtle shell.  Fucking barnacles  on the helmet.  God-given  piece of enjoyment. 
[03:55:30]  All right.  You want exaggerated?  Humor.  Here you go.  Steve P.  from New Hampshire.  Anne's cock  has a rotating light  on the end of it  so ships  won't crash  into his balls.  Not bad.  Anne's cock  has become  self-aware.  Self-aware.  Hello, Joshua.  It's sperm  are the size  of trout.  Anne's cock 
[03:56:00]  bear hang out  at the end  plucking it out  of the stream  to eat.  Steve, you mean.  Yes.  Steve O'more.  Anne's cock  starred in  Little Shop of Horrors  as the plant.  Enough about the cock.  Chester's liver  Anthony's Escalade  came with a free horse  trailer for his cock.  Anne's cock  killed a gay guy.  What?  That's a horse joke.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering. 
[03:56:30]  We love the horse.  Was he gay?  No.  He wasn't.  He'd like a male horse  to fuck his ass  but he was somehow hetero.  Figure that one out, gang.  Back to you.  Oh, Ellen's dancing.  She's funny.  Yeah.  Well, we could do this  for another half hour  but...  Yeah, but...  But, uh...  I think it's blowjobs.  Enough about the cock.  Oh, my God. 
[03:57:00]  I gotta go to this one.  Shane in Tennessee.  Go ahead.  I'm gonna try it.  Okay.  When Anthony gets a blowjob  does it look like  somebody blown into  a didgeridoo?  Legally luggy.  Legally luggy.  Impotential.  Old didgeridoo cock.  Yeah.  Didgeridoo.  This is actual audio  of Anthony getting blown.  Here it is right here. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, fuck.  Can I...  Hey, there could be  worse things.  We could be doing  an hour on  how tiny your cock is.  That's right.  We're doing you a service,  my friend.  That's right.  A didgeridoo.  Oh, no.  Let's go to Kevin  in Virginia Beach.  Kevin.  Yeah, when Anthony dies  we're gonna count the rings  on his cock.  Yeah.  What do I do?  That's good.  Tim in Westchester.  Yeah, I was wondering  if Anthony's house 
[03:58:00]  looks like the movie Alien  with all that goo  all over the place.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Here's your...  Spunkmeyer.  Get up here.  Anthony has a sleep  number bed  and he likes it on 16.  His cock likes a 30.  That's how he tested it.  Like, instead of dropping  the bowling ball  with the wine glass  on the other side,  he just smashed  his fat, delicious appendage  into the fucking  top of the bed  and knocked  the wine glass over.  I thought game was over,  but I gotta call 
[03:58:30]  game on.  Oh, come on.  Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  We'll do this  until they fall flat.  Go ahead, Fred.  Aunt Liz is cocking  the gutter  to go bumper bowling.  Ryan at PA.  Ryan.  Yeah.  Ann has to notify  the FAA  when he gets a hard on.  Now, that would be  implying  my dick would be  so big that  airplanes might hit it.  See, now it's 
[03:59:00]  gotten to the point  of complete  ridiculousness.  Well, Dave in Chicago.  Dave.  Yeah, I was wondering  when Anthony  was young,  did he use his  coming cat  to whitewash defenses?  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  All right, I think  we might be going.  Frunkus?  Line of the day.  We might be going.  Chris in Atlanta.  Chris?  Ants cock so big,  there's snow  on top of it.  All right, see,  now he's saying  that it's as big  as a mountain  that has snow  on its peaks.  All right.  Don't exaggerate. 
[03:59:30]  Ant's cock is so big  that when you hold  his balls,  the tip of it  rests halfway  up your forearm  and you just go,  my God.  But you don't yell  at you.  You just say gently.  Hopefully not in that voice.  Yeah, exactly.  My God.  Oh, my God.  Can we put the word  cumzies into this  whole bit?  It's too cute.  When Ant makes  cumzies. 
[04:00:00]  Ant's cock is so big  it has like scars  on it like a whale.  What?  When his boats  are hitting it?  Just scrapes  from girls' teeth  smash into his cock  because it doesn't fit.  Coral?  Coral reefs?  Let me ask you honestly,  have you ever had a doctor  like when you go  for the ball check,  like when you take  your dick out,  have you ever had a doctor  like kind of lean back  a little bit  and go,  sweet Jesus.  The doc sits  on his balls  like a hippity hop  or a hoppity hip  or whatever the fuck  that thing is.  No, that has never 
[04:00:30]  happened, Jimmy.  Have you ever had a doctor  start to say something  and then catch himself  like as soon as  your cock is out?  This is Anthony's cock.  I've been practicing medicine.  It's on Ellen right now.  There's an anaconda  on Ellen  and it's not an anaconda.  Well, we were confused  for a second.  Matt in D.C.,  what's up?  Hey, I was wondering  if that was Ant's cock  in the Kevin Bacon movie  Tremors?  No, what happens is  Anthony caught a doctor  one time.  He took his cock  out for the ball check  and the doctor said,  I've been practicing medicine  for 25 years 
[04:01:00]  and just stopped.  He just stopped himself.  Realized what he was saying?  He realized he was  supposed to be thinking that.  Did you ever use  your cock for T-ball?  No, I can say never.  That's a good one  by Matt Lafar  from Queensbury.  Ant was circumcised  with Alzar Cowey's knife.  Chris P. from Jersey  and has to lock his cock  in the basement  during full moons. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  I gotta pee.  Yeah.  Why don't you just pee  inside my hands' cock?  Me and my cock  have to go to court.  Well, Puddle of AIDS  writes that your cock  has mile markers.  Is that true?  No, it doesn't have  mile markers.  It would have to be  over two miles long,  I guess,  to need a mile marker.  Mm-hmm.  I like that one.  Ant's cock is not like  it's not an inhuman thing, 
[04:02:00]  but it is cock.  Here's the reaction.  Like, a lot of times  a girl will get  her hand on it  and she'll strain  and strain  and she'll go,  oh, if I go up by the tip  I can touch my fingers.  That's all.  And no,  I don't have to go to court  so the judge  can use it as a gavel.  Good luck at court there.  Oh, thanks.  That's why  the pretty shirt today, right?  No, I have a,  I brought clothes with me.  You brought court clothes?  I brought court clothes.  Not, you know,  up for murder charges,  court clothes.  Just neat. 
[04:02:30]  But you don't want  to look like  you're a felon  or something.  Ant's pee hole  is so big  it looks like  a cornucopia.  Various vegetables  tumbling out of it.  Yeah, why not?  Just rest your huge  mule on the table  at Thanksgiving.  And different colored  corn cobs.  Matt from  Pest Box Live  says,  Ant's Cock  has a grounds crew  to keep it  from knocking down  street lights.  This is silly. 
[04:03:00]  I'll try one.  Ant's Cock  is so big  that the crabs  are as large  as lobsters.  No!  I don't have crabs.  But if you did  they would be  the size of lobsters.  No!  You need light sticks  to pee.  No, I don't.  You hear a beep,  beep, beep.  They don't have to  guide it in  like an aircraft.  God.  You do get a big mule.  Is it a big  just admit to it  and we might stop.  I just, you know, 
[04:03:30]  I'm not going to  make judgments  on my own  anatomy  as compared to  anyone else.  Top Gunt  from Canada  wants to know  if you use  a tractor tire  for a cock ring.  Tractor tire?  Not even just a tire.  Tractor tire.  When Ant was circumcised  they used his foreskin  to cover the super dog.  Oh my god.  Ah, dude,  I can't give you credit  because it updated.  Fuck, that was good too.  That was a great one.  Ah, shit. 
[04:04:00]  Sorry, bro.  They're coming in so fast  I'd lost you already.  That wasn't mine.  Yes, I know.  And all they are  here on Pal Talk  is cock references.  Oh, God.  Jurassic Com  from IRF.  He writes,  rednecks go noodling  inside Ant's pee hole.  Noodle.  Jimmy went to the bathroom  he's back  and it's still going on.  Jimmy's good.  Oh, yeah.  There's a top  of Anthony's cock  right there.  In between  all this  I'd like to 
[04:04:30]  plug  to you,  my brother's  U2 tribute band  at the Bolton Center Theater  in Bayshore.  Is your cock  going to be there?  I'm sure they're  playing under it.  Staying under the show.  Oh, God.  It's not until  March 22nd  but tickets  are available now.  Yeah.  So go to  boltoncenter.org.  Bolton Center?  Yes.  B-O-U-L-T-O-N  center.org.  Dude, I've never seen 
[04:05:00]  feedback come in faster  and I can't give this guy  credit either  but some guy just wrote  All right, we get it.  He's got a big cock.  That's a great way  to end it.  No, the way to end it is  All right, we get it.  He's got a gift.  That's what that is.  Ant's cock is so big  it won't take Spielberg's  calls.  Rob in Jersey.  Hey, wait a minute.  These are turning into  a Chuck Norris joke, sir.  Well, that's okay.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[04:05:30]  Ant's cock so big  he gets XM for free  off his...  All right.  All right, finally.  Let's just end it  right there  on that bomb.  Nah.  You need to finish it.  All there's what?  I'm not going to...  Well, how about we try  to get back on track  with Casper from Connecticut.  Casper?  Good evening.  Anthony, your cock  is bigger than U.S. Steel.  Very good  Godfather 2 reference.  Certainly was.  Very nice.  All right.  He likes the cruise 
[04:06:00]  vacations.  What?  You like the cruise  ship vacations  since he uses  the portholes  as glory holes.  Johnny's from Montreal.  I just want to get that.  Pat from Putnam.  Pat?  Yeah.  What's up?  Ant's cock's so big 
[04:06:30]  his legs are jealous.  Cool.  All right.  How do we end this?  He has a toenail  on his cock.  Oof.  That was all right.  So big it has  its own zip code.  Yes.  All right.  Here's your line of the day.  Here  comes  line of the day.  Line of the day.  Man stole 1,600 
[04:07:00]  pairs of blank  breasts.  And that's how you  executive produce.  It's a long story.  Long and tragic.  Like your cock.  I knew it.  I knew it.  Hey, Jared  from West Virginia  writes, 
[04:07:30]  Bob Kelly,  well,  Ant's cock is so big.  Yes,  of course you start  with that.  Bob Kelly uses  Anthony's cock  to go,  what was it?  Snooba?  Snooba diving?  Snooba.  You and your stupid  Snooba.  Snooba.  You just hook your mouth  right under the head  of his cock  and you can go down  around 20 feet  for a half hour.  Oh, shit.  Ant's got to get to court.  Jimmy's got to shit.  Bob Kelly's got to  I'm going to the gym. 
[04:08:00]  And I'm going to  Your what?  I'm going to the gym.  Bob's been hitting  the gym a lot.  Ever since that  last pounding I took.  He actually didn't  even need that.  You guys were all  laughing anyways.  What did I say?  What?  For my diabetes  supplies.  There you go.  I got diabetes  and I'm a big fat  fuck with a  walrus mustache.  And I can't say  diabetes.  I say diabetes  gets the supplies  of liberty. 
[04:08:30]  Look at him.  I wish he'd fall  backwards into that  fireplace and  and crackle like a  fucking sugar-filled  marshmallow.  It looks like your  cock before it gets  horrid.  My cock does not  look like Wilford  Brimley.  Big and fat with a  sweater.  It doesn't have  diabetes.  It has to have  its own sweater  to keep it warm.  Jesus Christ. 
[04:09:00]  Enough about the  cock.  I'm going to tear  down a wall though,  Bobby.  What did I say to  you when we were  not goofing?  You lost some  weight.  Thank you.  Yeah, you did  in a little bit.  The last time.  I want people to  think that I'm  human every once  in a while.  I think you got  a pounding.  This shows was  actually complimentary.  Thank you.  I got pounded for  I think an hour  and a half.  We got to hurry?  That joke, so.  Yeah, let's.  We got to hurry  because we're going  to replay that  call, that brilliant  call that Jimmy  made yesterday.  Well, you know,  whatever.  See you guys  tomorrow morning?  We promoted it, 
[04:09:30]  right?  Yeah, I'm going  to be at  Stress Factory.  Yes.  Are you coming  back tomorrow  too, I think?  I don't know if  you want me to.  I'll just come  back.  Oh, just stop.  I'll come by.  What do you want  to?  I'll come by.  Are you officially  invited?  No.  I got Poughkeepsie  coming up in a  couple weeks in  San Francisco.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  So we'll see you  guys tomorrow.  See you, Musk.  Diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, testing  supplies.  Oh, God. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, boy.  Hey, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  What?  I didn't see that  one coming.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
