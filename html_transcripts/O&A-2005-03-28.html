<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a focus on co-host Ben's severe gastrointestinal distress, possibly stemming from bad sushi.  This was followed by a lengthy, graphic description of his illness, interspersed with the attempted playing of their "What's in My Pants" game with a caller named Doris from Indiana.  The show then played and mocked audio clips from "How's Your News," a news program produced by individuals with intellectual disabilities, using derogatory language to describe the participants.

The hosts transitioned into a discussion of the Kennedy family and their scandals, specifically mentioning Michael Kennedy Smith. This segued into a discussion of Robert Chambers, the "Preppy Killer," and his subsequent drug arrest. Opie recounted a speeding ticket incident, comparing it to *Battlestar Galactica*.  Caller suggestions for games, including "Sex for Sam" and a game involving the alleged killing of a wife (compared to the Kennedy family's history), were discussed, followed by a humorous Star Trek parody.

The show delved into a video game recreating the JFK assassination, detailing its mechanics, scoring system, and graphic depictions of violence. Opie discussed his gameplay with his brother, a JFK assassination expert, who corrected Opieâ€™s factual inaccuracies. They also discussed attending the assassination's anniversary in Dealey Plaza.  This section concluded with Jimmy Norton recounting personal anecdotes, including a childhood sexual encounter and masturbation habits, followed by the playing and discussion of his new, unusual "Monster Rain" song.  Further discussion of Norton's sexual exploits followed.

A caller, Robert Kelly, then recounted graphic details of childhood sexual experiences, including mutual masturbation and oral sex with his friend's developmentally disabled younger brother, followed by further sexual encounters involving a developmentally disabled girl. The hosts responded with crude humor and exaggerated descriptions. The conversation shifted to dangerously designed children's toys, with numerous listener calls providing examples.  A poorly written and tasteless song about the Lacey Peterson murder case was played and discussed.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of the Scott Peterson trial verdict and the subsequent media attention given to jurors, particularly the "redheaded chick" juror, using derogatory language. The hosts then expressed disdain for Michael Jackson, engaging in graphic and offensive jokes about his alleged actions.  Numerous listener-submitted song parodies about the Lacey Peterson murder case were played, ranging in quality and taste, alongside running commentary filled with mockery and insults.  Callers offered opinions on the Peterson case, Michael Jackson, and the song parodies; one caller even shared an anecdote about their own experience with a child molestation case. More listener-submitted music, including an offensive parody of "The Little Drummer Boy," was played, with continued offensive jokes and language.  The show concluded with a brief discussion of the hosts' past reckless teenage behavior and numerous prank calls to O.J. Simpson by a person identified as "Kid Chris," along with a clip of Simpson claiming he would not pay his debt to the Goldman family, and a discussion of various video games based on the Kennedy assassination and O.J. Simpson.  No guests appeared in studio.

[00:03:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen. 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really fucking stupid.  This week is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Doris was embarrassing.  Doris from Indiana, what's going on today?  Not much.  No?  No.  Why are you calling the show?  I want to play What's in My Pants.  You want to play What's in My Pants?  Yep.  You know how to play?  I think I'm first.  What?  I think I do.  Yeah.  All right.  It's where you take the phone and rub it on your intimate area, and we guess what kind 
[00:04:30]  of hairstyle you have just from the sound.  Uh-huh.  And you know that.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You want to play or what?  We played this yesterday.  We're trying to balance this out.  I think we should play it again.  She called in.  We'll do it quick.  We'll do a quick game.  What about this, though?  I know.  I want to do that.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What to do?  I kind of want to play.  Hey, um, how old a gal are you?  44.  All right.  We're going to play the retard clips.  All right.  Oh, we're going to go to the sound clips that we had.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I love that bit. 
[00:05:00]  We got the retards doing the news clips.  Oh, I just want to punch out of this show today.  Yeah, let's play the retard clips.  Yeah.  Should we have Doris call in tomorrow? 
[00:05:30]  Who?  We can go smooth that one over.  Doris.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Hi.  Hi.  We might get to you, so hold on a line, all right?  All right.  44, though, huh?  Yep.  How many kids?  Three.  Three kids?  Oh, Anthony, we're going to play the...  All right.  Let's pop that in the DVD, CD player.  And play the...  Simordial.  Yeah.  Retard clips, sure.  Natural childbirth or cesarean? 
[00:06:00]  Two were natural, and the last one was cesarean.  Oh, boy.  Look at the time, Anthony.  We might have to leave for the week.  Wow.  All right.  Well, how's your news?  Ben, go smooth that over.  We would love to talk to her tomorrow.  Yes.  Sure.  Two more years, she'll be able to call up and play What's in My Diaper.  Guess the hairstyle.  Gray?  Uh, Doris? 
[00:06:30]  Yes?  Jim Norton has something he wants to say to you.  Okay.  I really appreciate your call on the show, and I hope we get to you, because I think  it'd be fun to play the game with you.  Okay.  Do you have a bunt?  Excuse me?  A bunt.  A bunt?  A bunt.  You know what that is, a bunt cake?  You know, it's not a belly, and it's not a, it's a bunt.  I try.  No, I don't have a bunt cake.  All right.  A bunt cake.  Anthony, do you have anything to say to Doris?  No.  Thank you for, uh, thank you for calling, and please hold on. 
[00:07:00]  All right?  All right.  All right.  There's Doris from, uh, Indiana.  Indiana.  House dress.  She wants to help the show.  All right, Anthony, how's your news?  It's in my bloomers.  This is a, uh, a show they did on Trio.  Yeah.  This is, uh, retards doing the news.  Yeah.  They, they were at some camp or something, and all decided it would be kind of cool for  them to get together, something for them to do, uh, put on a news program.  Right.  Where, where they would do interviews, and tape it, and broadcast it. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  So, I think it's a very brave thing to do, Opie.  You know?  Just because they're, I call them, you know what I call them, Opie?  Handicapable.  A lot of people say handicapped.  I like saying handicapable.  Well, here's the deal with this.  They're not letting their handicaps, uh, get in the way of, of them fulfilling their dreams.  And living a normal life.  Well, they were at the...  Slow down.  We got audio of them at the, uh, Democratic Convention, um, interviewing celebrities. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And I'm sorry, man, but, uh, how could you not laugh when you listen to this?  And people would call you, you know, a jerk for laughing at this.  They would call you a jerk for laughing if they weren't calling you a jerk for the last  half hour of radio.  And, uh, I don't know.  It's just really funny.  I'm sorry.  It is funny.  And the people that they try to interview, because I guess they're trying to come across  as a legitimate news outlet, but they're retarded.  And, uh, the people that they interview put on that condescending, like, voice, like, 
[00:08:30]  oh, yeah, okay.  And they know they have to be nice.  Like, if it was any schmuck with a microphone that came up to them and was trying to interview  them, they would, you know, brush them off.  Nah, I mean, nothing for you today.  All right.  But they're retarded, so they have to be nice, and you could hear it in their voice.  Well, we think, uh...  Well, this was on Trio last night.  We're going to run out of time, so...  Hey, that's great!  Yeah, let's get to the clips, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is kind of the how's your news intro.  Listen to this.  And I think one of them speaks to James Carvel for a little bit here. 
[00:09:00]  Is this the girl?  Yeah.  She's, uh, like, three feet tall, in a wheelchair.  Is she in a wheelchair?  No?  No, no.  This one is...  Her head's kind of like this, and she kind of always looks out.  But she's only about three or four feet tall.  Yeah.  All right.  Excuse me, Mr. Carvel?  Yes, dear.  How do you feel about a news program being hosted by people with disabilities?  A new program hosted by people with disabilities?  I'll be great.  Well...  I think people with disabilities make an enormous contribution to this. 
[00:09:30]  Well, that's exactly what we're doing here.  We're shooting for a, um, man on the street news documentary of our own that we're calling  How's Your News?  Well, I'm good.  You know, I'm happy to...  Hello, and welcome to How's Your News Convention Coverage 2004.  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm a woman with disabilities who loves her life.  And I'm very excited to tell you all about this unique project we call How's Your News. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Thank you very much.  Well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me about this.  Thank you.  Anytime you want me on, you just let me know, sweetheart.  All right.  You know, he's, uh...  He wants to say something.  Okay.  Very opinionated.  Like, well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's what you were thinking.  That's exactly what you were thinking.  And, hey, sir, let it be known that the feeling is mutual, okay?  All right.  I like that, too, this program. 
[00:10:30]  How's Your News is a new team made up of people with various disabilities.  We all met at a summer camp many years ago, and it was at this camp that we came up with  the idea of making our very own version of the news.  One time at retard camp?  We got together with some counselors from the camp, and we selected a crack team of six  outgoing reporters.  Here they are.  This is Bobby.  Most of the time, we can't understand what he is saying, but he does understand us. 
[00:11:00]  And, hey, he always seems to get the scoop.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  We just work here.  We just work here.  We just work here.  I'm sorry.  If you're not laughing, I bet.  Hilarious.  If you're not laughing, is that what?  You're probably a decent human being?  Yes.  All of compassion.  The guy's like, ah, we just work here, man.  This here is Larry.  Like Bobby, he understands everything which is said to him. 
[00:11:30]  But since he can't talk, we've made a board with four questions on it.  And he uses the mics to point out the one he wants to ask.  What was that?  Wait a minute.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  Here we go.  And he uses the mics to point out the one he wants to ask.  I recognize that.  He either asked about paramilitary operations in Iraq, or he shit his pants. 
[00:12:00]  This is Sean Costello.  He is known for having a pretty subtle sense of humor.  Hey, I bet.  What?  Dude, why did you give that love?  No, because this is a serious story.  It's a turn away.  Jeremy here is 18 years old.  He's got a lot of energy and curiosity.  And he sure doesn't like to stay on one subject for very long.  And ask his forgiveness and stop that practice. 
[00:12:30]  Do you have any favorite bands that you listen to?  And then there's Ronnie.  He loves celebrities, especially celebrities from the 1970s.  B.J. Honeycutt.  How the hell are you?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  How's Alan Alda doing?  Tonight, you are very lucky because you have tuned in to our most exciting adventure today.  That's right, Susan.  Can you believe it?  This crew is going to the Democrat and Republican conventions. 
[00:13:00]  We're certainly not your typical news team.  But hey, maybe that's what this election needs is a little sense of humor.  Get ready for something completely different, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for How's Your News.  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother.  He's the funny one, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's the one with retard strength.  When he sees a celebrity, he runs over and he kind of like grabs them and locks them in 
[00:13:30]  so they can't move.  All right.  Let's go to the second clip.  How's your news, Anthony?  This is Peter Jennings, right?  Yeah.  Okay, sir.  What's your name?  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm one of the reporters.  Hi, Susan.  I'm Peter Jennings.  I work for ABC.  It's nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  How do you feel about being here at the convention?  I feel excited.  Do you feel excited about being here?  Yeah.  I think the excitement you're feeling is a two-way street.  I think if I had your voice and your charm, I'd get better ratings at night. 
[00:14:00]  You fraudulent Canadian jizzbag.  You would get more ratings because it would be a complete freak show.  Imagine him sitting there, Peter Jennings looking like he does and going, hi, it's Peter Jennings  with the news.  I'd start watching the news again every night.  Everyone would watch.  Are you kidding me?  So he's absolutely right.  Oh, yes.  You hear how he all of a sudden was like, yeah.  And what's your name?  I would, what's your name? 
[00:14:30]  Hmm.  Because if you don't tell me, I'll just think of you as drooling idiots.  Bunch of corkies.  How nice to see you.  Thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  In the meantime, live from the floor of the Democratic Convention, this is Susan Harrington  reporting live for House Young News.  I want to know why she laughed.  Did he tickle her clit with a pig's foot?  Coming up, see what Hillary Clinton says when Sean and Larry catch up with her. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, please don't change the dial to CBS or anything like that.  Just stay tuned.  Well said.  Did I hear him say butt?  All right.  Jesus, come on.  They caught up with Al Franken in this clip.  Who's the retard in this clip?  You know, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  All righty. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  I'm Al Franken and I'm at the Recoveringist Convention.  Yeah.  Are you having a good time?  Yeah.  Who have you talked to so far?  I'm sorry.  Bullion.  Bullion.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya. 
[00:16:00]  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you.  Yeah.  I'm glad you're here.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I shake your hand?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you very much.  What's he saying?  Okay, have a good time.  Al Franken is so uncomfortable in that clip.  Ah, bah, bah, bah.  What is that? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  I wonder what he was trying to say.  Maybe someone out there speaks retard.  God damn how frustrating that must be.  Like, because I think the girl was saying that he can think, but he just can't talk.  Right.  So he's trying to ask him something.  It's a horrible position to be in, too, because you know the camera's right on Al Franken.  Like, in his mind, it's probably like, oh, you ass, you know, hey, Al Franken, you asshole liberal.  And it comes out, ah, bah, bah, ah, bah, bah.  Well, no, if he's a complete retard, he's probably telling Al Franken, I agree completely with your political beliefs. 
[00:17:00]  All right, here's Triumph, the insult comic dog.  Oh.  What's your name?  Triumph, the insult comic dog.  Oh, it comes to a dog, huh?  Yes.  Oh, what do you do, comic dog?  What am I doing?  Yeah, what do you do?  You know, I'm here to do what all the reporters are doing, you know, ask questions about the issues, sniff their butts, hump their legs, that kind of thing. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Oh, you could tell he was thrown.  He was a little thrown.  He wasn't thrown.  He wasn't, that was.  If he had any balls, he would have attacked that dumbbell right there.  Thank you.  Why not?  Why not?  That's great.  You have great chromosomes for me to poop on.  That's great.  Where's your mother, the one pregnant, drinking and smoking?  So, at what trimester did your father punch your mother in the stomach? 
[00:18:00]  Look at your haircut.  My hairdo is better around my asshole.  I'd rather have a conversation with the cigar in my mouth.  Look at your head. 
[00:18:30]  It's huge.  You look like a boxer.  I've looked at the smaller heads humping a great dame from behind.  That is a huge head.  Oh, my God.  This show is awful.  He lost his balls.  He did.  He didn't go after him.  He was all, yes, we're here to cover the election.  I believe he was neutered.  What?  No?  Your parents should have been spayed and neutered to keep freaks like you from walking the earth. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  The way you stand there like a stump, I was going to pee on you.  I mistook you for a tree.  Then I realized a tree is smarter.  Pete Rose called.  He wants his hair back.  And he's bedding five to one.  You're not even human. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, man.  We have time maybe for like one or two more of these.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we used to sing their sing song.  And today...  Oh, could you stop for a second?  First of all, Rob Reiner does not want to be called the meathead, ever.  The guy is now a director.  He, you know, he was the meathead on All in the Family. 
[00:20:00]  But you don't want to be called that after you've moved on for 40 years or whatever it's been.  And here he comes.  He's got to...  You know, if anyone else called him meathead, he wouldn't give him the time of day and would walk away.  But here he's a retarded, so he's got to entertain this guy.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we used to sing their sing song.  And today...  Boy, the way, Glenn Miller played.  Saw some of the head parlor. 
[00:20:30]  Guys are like we had it, man.  Children were the days.  And you know what you were then.  Girls were girls and men were men.  Mister, we can use a Democrat party like Kerry again.  Mister, we could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  Oh, my God.  I'm drooling like a retard. 
[00:21:00]  I'm drooling like a retard.  I'm drooling like a retard.  Oh, God.  Oh, that got me. 
[00:21:30]  That would be a promo.  Oh, I hear a new Jimmy sing.  Oh, you made me cry.  I just can't help my laugh.  Oh, you made me cry.  Do we have time for one more?  We need to go late today.  Is that possible?  I don't even know if the system's set up.  Listen to Wolf Blitzer being a dick to the kid.  When Kerry gets elected, what would you like to see Kerry and Edwards change as far as changes to them in this country? 
[00:22:00]  You're pretty positive that they're going to be elected, are you?  Because, you know, there's another side, the Republicans, they want to get elected, too.  Oh, I know.  But right now, I'm just thinking.  I think you're meant to say if they get elected.  Right.  If and when, yeah.  Well, you keep saying when.  You don't know for sure they're going to get elected, do you?  Right, but I'm saying if.  I meant to say if and when.  If they get elected.  Yeah.  Because the Republicans might get elected.  Right. 
[00:22:30]  We don't know.  The election's very close.  That's true.  Yeah.  So what's the question again?  But if and when Kerry and Edwards get elected, what would you like to see them change?  He was brutal with her.  What's the question, you retard?  I like Wolf.  Yeah, right?  The only one that actually stood up to those retards.  How many times have I said it's stupid?  It's a genetic embarrassment.  Wipe your mouth. 
[00:23:00]  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  You didn't wake up like Ben today.  Ben isn't in today.  Why isn't Ben in?  He called me.  I got up at like 3.30 this morning and the phone's ringing.  It's Ben saying that he's just shitting like he's never shipped before. 
[00:23:30]  And he says, I would rather deal with this at home than at work.  I'm like, yeah, whatever, dude, because we don't want to deal with it.  Is he flinging his windows open in his bathroom with that frigid cold in there?  He's sweating more than usual.  His head's sweating.  He's on the toilet.  His legs are shaking.  Stupid glasses are askew.  Poor Ben.  Awful Boston dumps.  This big hog is resting in the toilet water.  Lazily hanging in there.  Nice chowder shit. 
[00:24:00]  The bottom of his balls are just brushing up against the water.  I don't know why, and I'll admit it, but Jim and I are obsessed with Ben's hog.  We're trying to figure out what the hell's going on in the front of his pants.  We've said this many times, but for the new listeners, we don't know if he has just really big balls or he's got just an enormous hog.  It really is.  You can't not look at it when he bobbles in the studio with his messy hair.  He's a very hairy guy, perhaps.  It's just a lot of hair. 
[00:24:30]  In a disarray, like on his head.  Ben's a mess.  Now he's crapping.  What's the update with Ben?  He still won't come on the phone?  God, he's going to be in bad shape today.  Anyway, he won't come to the phone?  He'll talk to Steve, but he won't come on the air.  Ben is very, very sick.  I just got done talking to him.  I explained to him that you'd like to get him on the air, but he said, I can't.  I can't even get out of bed.  He said it's bad sushi, he thinks.  Oh, really?  Never good.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  He had some sushi last night.  He can't move.  Bad sushi?  Yeah, he's running to the bathroom every ten minutes.  And Ben never gets sick, to be honest with you.  Ben never gets sick.  So if he's out, it's bad.  Is he puking or dumping?  I think it's both.  That's why I'm always paranoid about sushi, but everybody thinks I'm nuts.  Yeah, same.  I know everybody, everyone I know has had bad sushi at one time or another.  I eat sushi all the time.  I got sick once, and it was because I went to one of these stupid lunch places that advertise 
[00:25:30]  half-price sushi.  Oh, dude.  It was years ago.  I learned my lesson.  Yeah.  And I brought the sushi home, and it tasted bad right away, so I stopped eating it.  So I didn't get that sick.  Yeah.  Not like a Ben.  And then I decided to try to feed it to my cats at the time, and the cats wouldn't eat  it.  I'm like...  If the cats won't eat sushi, bad sign.  I'm like, I am in deep ass.  Oh.  Deep ass.  And were you?  Oh, yeah.  And that was just from my thing.  I think I ate one piece. 
[00:26:00]  Everybody shoveled it in, laughing and giggling, not thinking.  Oh.  Dude, I'm fucking gossiping and having a great time.  I was with Bono, hanging out with Bono.  Yeah.  Dude, shoving it down his gullet.  My worst experience, I was going to the beach, Robert Moses or something, out there on Long  Island, and went to one of the delis, got myself a nice ham and Swiss on a roll with  mustard.  Nice, right?  Ah, yeah.  And then a side order of potato salad.  Mmm, potato salad.  Nice little whatever, you know, quarter ounce or half ounce, whatever. 
[00:26:30]  First of all, let me chastise you for potato salad on the beach.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  You don't take it to the beach.  Took it to the beach.  I remember it was about 100 degrees.  Yeah, nice baking in the sun, mayonnaise, egg.  Maybe an hour or two later, I finally decide to get to my potato salad.  Good choice.  That was very, very mayonnaise-y.  Mm-hmm.  And I ate the thing.  And then I had to go out east to have dinner with my brother.  And to make a long story short, it got so bad, the diarrhea, that I was dry heaving from 
[00:27:00]  my butt.  Nothing else would come out, but I was still contracting.  Like it was just opening up and puckering?  Yeah.  It was like, look like a horse after they're done.  When a horse is finished, but it's still like the muscles are still going.  It must have been so bad that my body was saying, look, we don't know what's still left  in here, but we're going to still try to get it out.  You don't think Ben has the flu, do you?  I don't think so.  He probably just ate Ben's.  Oh, there you go.  Something to be paranoid about. 
[00:27:30]  Great.  Just making sure.  Looks like Grandma's lips.  Come kiss Grandma.  All right.  Poor Ben.  I feel bad for the little messy-haired little guy.  The little awful body.  Little fella.  Well, let's get into some show stuff.  Glasses all askew, fogging up from the heat coming off of his body.  He's got a bucket in his lap, puking and shitting at the same time.  That's a tough thing to do.  Yeah.  You don't know where to go. 
[00:28:00]  You flip around.  Do you get the garbage bucket and sit there?  Or do you...  Do you ever puke and shit at the same time?  No.  Well, same thing happened with the potato salad.  I know some people that have...  Toilet, thank God, right next to the sink, because how else do you figure that one out?  I've heard stories of people that go to woof.  They go into the toilet, and it shoots out on the wall behind them.  It's a hysterical image, but I wouldn't want to be there.  You just brought back a memory, man. 
[00:28:30]  Gee, really?  I'm sorry to hear that.  From the frat house, we had this disgusting pig of a guy.  He was a fat guy.  I don't want to say his name.  The guy would get so hammered, and then he would have explosive diarrhea,  and for some reason he needed to sleep naked in the TV room with a blanket.  Jesus!  Why didn't you tell the guy?  Knock it off!  Whatever.  You're in your room, whatever, whatever.  I mean, these guys would come home at 4 or 5 in the morning, whatever they want to do.  And I guess he would be so drunk, he would just take his clothes off. 
[00:29:00]  He had no idea what was going on.  He's one of these guys.  And we actually found crap on the walls, all over the couch.  Like, he had exposed, his ass exploded, like, all over the TV room.  And instead of, like, the rest of us getting pissed off, we were just amazed.  Like, how the F?  Just crapped all over the walls.  What position do you have to be in to get crap, like, I don't know, 5 feet up on a wall? 
[00:29:30]  And then the guy's apologizing because he doesn't remember anything.  Of course not.  XM202.  The OBM Anthony Show.  Do we have an update on poor Ben?  Ben's very sick.  Both phones are off and dumping both into voicemail.  Is he sleeping, you think?  Oh, wow.  I think so.  I think he's in a lot of pain.  Oh, she was in here.  We should have spun him in a circle.  Oh, he's puking and crapping his brains out because he ate bad sushi.  That's what we're hearing.  Yeah.  The reports are in.  Hopefully we'll get an update tomorrow.  Usually that's a 24-hour thing, right? 
[00:30:00]  If you get the bad sushi.  I thought I was fucking...  How much he can't even be herky-jerky today?  He's probably like...  Oh, the second he herks or jerks, he craps himself.  He's only herky-ing.  Like a doll that's running out of batteries.  His messy hair is all matted down with sweat over his eyes.  Tippy Tom underwear.  The poor guy.  Oh, he's a mess.  He's more of a mess than usual.  Poor little Ben.  Poor Ben.  His little hedgehog body all curled up in a ball as he shivers. 
[00:30:30]  He can't get the sheet to cover his big cock.  Keeps flopping over the side of the bed.  Hits the floor.  Yeah.  All that body hair shedding on his bed sheets.  As he shivers.  Making a little hole in his mattress like a den.  For him to just lay in.  Sweating in it.  Leaning over the bed, just vomiting into his bucket.  Every time he sneezes, he has to change the sheets. 
[00:31:00]  Because he's shitting onto his nice bed.  Shoot.  Flarks.  I bet you when he's in the bathroom, he looks like toothpaste being squeezed in the middle.  Just both ends shooting some type of vile, smelly liquid.  We now go inside Ben's bathroom.  God bless me, dude. 
[00:31:30]  That's insane.  That's nuts.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Call back to yesterday's show.  That's crazy.  That's nuts.  That's insane, dude.  Dude, my friend in Boston.  As he's clapping.  He's clapping and hurting.  He's puking and shitting.  Go socks. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, bad sushi.  That's why the bowl's glowing.  Poor Ben.  That big head.  It's hard to get it completely over the toilet.  Because when he bends over, his skull hits the lid.  So he pukes half on the front of the seat and half in the bowl.  He has to go sideways.  So that big head doesn't hit the fucking...  The upturned lid. 
[00:32:30]  He's clanking the septic tank.  You hate when you're sitting there like...  Nothing came out.  I go...  You prepare for your abs to hurt.  Oh, and it's just aching.  Poor Ben.  He's been wiping his ass since 4 o'clock in the morning.  It probably feels like a nice raw... 
[00:33:00]  Like he rubbed a piece of a potato chip in between.  Like a sour cream and onion potato chip.  In between his tender ass cheeks.  It's all red and sore.  First time his abs have felt any kind of workout.  Yeah.  He's going to come in with a six pack.  Abs.  All buff.  Little short arms.  That's a disaster.  That's why he can't comb his hair.  His arms are too short.  Poor guy's at home suffering.  Yeah, poor little T-Rex body.  Can't even...  Tries to comb it, but he's herking and jerking, so his hair goes all over the place. 
[00:33:30]  He probably wipes his ass by rubbing it on the rug like a dog does.  It's called scooting.  He's scoot on the rug.  Oh, dude.  Yeah, poor guy.  Liquid-y awful dump.  Oh, you know it's just a bad day for him at home.  I'd like to see that guy from Pennsylvania giving it to Ben in his dumper while he's puking.  He can't even shit.  He's so filled to the rim with shame.  He's being brutally raped on the radio. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  And Ben hates when we talk about his personal stuff or his cock.  Oh, I know.  I can't stop talking about it.  I wish he was here.  He hates it.  Yeah.  Oh, that bathroom.  Who's going to...  Does he have a maid or something?  I hope so.  A street team of some sort.  A street team.  Looks like he threw a yoo-hoo into the ceiling fan.  Someone's got to clean that up.  Oh, that's fucking hilarious. 
[00:34:30]  My second chocolate beverage joke of the day.  And they're both gems.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, that's funny.  It's dripping onto his rug.  I hope his whole apartment is ruined with his shit and vomit.  I hope he puked into every electronic component he has.  Dude, I got shit in my cell phone.  Poor guy.  The only thing that would make me happier is if I could lift up his sheet and cut one of 
[00:35:00]  my vile farts and then watch his sweaty forehead be too sick to get up and just vomit.  Spray Lysol.  He can't do anything.  He's going to puke like the exorcist.  Just lay there and vomit pea soup in your pillow.  Powerless.  Oh, the poor son of a bitch.  That's awful.  Steve, any...  Just talked to Ben.  He's on his way to the doctor, I believe.  Oh, is he listening?  Yeah, he's listening.  He said, is it you that keeps trying to call me?  Knock it off.  Is he feeling a little bit better? 
[00:35:30]  Not really.  Knock it off to the doctor.  He's in bed.  He can't stop sweating.  Can we call out?  So he's back to normal.  That's good.  When can he sweat?  He's one of those guys that would be the polar swimmers who would sweat when he gets out  of the little hole in the ice.  Who's that guy ice fishing, naked, sweating?  He's going to the doctor.  Yeah.  He sounds serious now.  He's fine.  He doesn't sound like he's in good shape.  Has he been taking Pepto-Bismol or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just want to say hi to him real fast. 
[00:36:00]  He won't.  He sees the number on the cell phone and he just won't pick it up.  And then he calls my other cell and he goes, stop it.  What does he think he is?  Earl?  Yeah.  That sound etiquette?  Oh, God.  Is that funny?  I want him to hold the phone by the bowl while he's releasing it.  That's what I want to hear.  Definitely.  Ben isn't that kind of guy, though.  Not at all.  He doesn't like it.  He's very embarrassed.  He's very private about his bodily functions.  His bodily functions.  I remember when we were doing dump stories, he was very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable.  He opens the door or the window in the bathroom here and freezes everybody out. 
[00:36:30]  I'll bet you when he was a kid, he was known as Big Doody's Ben.  I'll bet you in kindergarten, he clogged a couple of toilets or he stood up and had  the type of logs that were poking up through the seat and the other boys and girls noticed,  hey, it's Big Doody's Ben.  Stuck with him and gave him a complex.  That's why he sweats so much.  He's always nervous that they're going to stick up and give him away.  They're going to think of my little name that they gave me and taunt me with it.  Big Doody's Ben. 
[00:37:00]  Carlos from Long Island.  Ben's A-hole looks like the back of the Batmobile.  That's good.  Where's Gary Hulley?  In the CD player.  No, when are we going to get him in studio?  Are we going to get him before Christmas, hopefully?  Yeah, Ben is actually working on that right now.  Or are you guys booking him for Groundhog Day?  What's Ben working on?  I don't see Ben doing a whole lot of anything except eating cereal and herky-ing and jerky-ing  all over the studio.  Herky-ing, jerky-ing.  I'm taking calls on his tiny little cell phone. 
[00:37:30]  His little tiny cell phone.  That chiclet cell phone.  If somebody walks in too fast, he can just eat his phone.  Ben's phone stinks.  What do you carry?  That, your cock hole?  What kind of phone is that?  What, he's gossiping about something?  Dude, Pedro does coke.  What?  My friend Tim from Boston knows what he does.  It's always some drivel he heard from some drunken mick at a party.  It's like, yeah, I've bought it from you too, it's coming in.  It's like, horse shit. 
[00:38:00]  Dude, I comb my hair with a car bomb.  You forgot that.  That's insane.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  He just giggles about nothing.  I'm like, Ben, I've got to get this done.  Giggling idiot.  He was laughing when you guys were talking serious about the death penalty.  Did anyone else catch it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, dude, there's just too many poor people. 
[00:38:30]  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Who doesn't love Ben?  I like the parody of Ben better than Ben now.  I thought someone got one of their teeth knocked out.  It was Ben's phone.  Your phone needs a filling.  I love the fact that he's always gossiping.  Always gossiping about somebody who has something to do with Boston.  Jim Rice is from Boston Children.  What?  Easy. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, man.  Guys, yeah, that's funny.  Let me see your phone, Ben.  You got it on you?  Where'd you lose it?  Look at this.  Look how little that is.  Wow.  Tell me some small phones.  It stinks anyway.  It doesn't work that well, that one.  It's a tiny little phone.  That Ben parody is hilarious. 
[00:39:30]  I wish people could see it and they just, you got to know Ben.  No, they get it.  You just got to know Ben.  He's so herky.  He's always moving around.  He's so jerky.  And he just always laughs in the wrong places.  Yeah.  And you're like being serious.  Like, dude, look, I'm running late.  Look, here's some gossip.  Yeah, there's some gossip.  It's like a market.  It's like guns.  What?  Always gossiping.  Always a little gossip.  Because he does. 
[00:40:00]  He knows everyone in Boston.  Everyone.  So any bit of news that comes out of Boston.  He knows everything about Boston.  Everything that the common folk read about in Boston, he will know like ten layers deep  into the story.  Dude, I was trying to hang out with Tom Brady.  What?  What happened with Tom Brady?  It's like some scandal that never materializes.  He was with ten broads or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that was the Tom Brady gossip.  I guess I got that call.  Dude, I was with the Crafts at the new stadium.  There's a body buried in the basement. 
[00:40:30]  It's insane.  I swear.  What?  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  I would have called you, but my phone was in my ear.  I couldn't get it out.  So I got a toothpick.  I got my phone stuck between my teeth.  I got to pick it out, dude.  This phone makes me physically ill.  The Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, Anthony, we got some audio of OJC.  Simpson.  Oh, the latest OJ. 
[00:41:00]  And you got the story, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  OJ, any time you see that O.J. in any headline, you know it's going to be entertaining.  OJ has now given us over a decade of fun and joy and happiness in the news.  Any time a story about O.J. pops up in the news, you just, I run to it.  Right.  I'm still fascinated by O.J.  Can I play the clip real fast?  It's 10 seconds.  And then you have more in that article there.  To Fred's face in debtor hearings. 
[00:41:30]  If I have to work to pay them, I won't work.  It's that simple.  So, I'll just play golf every day.  Oh, this son of a bitch.  You know, what is Fred Goldman waiting for?  Just kill him.  Kill him.  What is he waiting for?  You have to take one for the team.  You have to kill O.J.  You'll go to jail.  Probably not for a long time, I don't think.  They'll call him a racist.  Oh, well, they'll probably pull that card out. 
[00:42:00]  He shot the black man who murdered his son.  You know something?  What is Fred Goldman waiting for at this point?  You have to kill O.J.  Now O.J.'s basically saying, O.J. owes Fred Goldman and the family there how much?  $33.5 million.  And O.J. has decided he will not pay them a dime.  He'd rather play golf all day.  Because if he works, here's O.J.'s situation.  Here's what poor O.J., the situation he's in.  Lives down in Florida.  He's got a $575,000 house in Florida, which is pretty good in Florida. 
[00:42:30]  Sure.  He collects $30,000 a month from his NFL pension.  A month.  $30,000 every month.  The pension, by law, cannot be touched by the victim's families.  So he's got this coming in.  For some reason, why is that?  Why can't you sue this guy?  He's making $30,000 a month.  And they can't sap any money out of that because of some law.  It's probably for old people or some people that are making, you know, obviously, you know, $1,500 a month. 
[00:43:00]  You can't tap into a lawsuit.  Yeah, but Jesus.  Yeah.  In the future, his annuity will pay him as much as $125,000 a month.  So I guess that goes up.  If he works, if he does any work, any money he makes from working, a percentage of that will go to pay this $33,500,000 to the Goldman family.  So he refuses to work.  That's brilliant.  It is.  And he mocks Fred Goldman in the process.  And now, remember when this first happened and he was acquitted, he walked around and he didn't say much about anything. 
[00:43:30]  Well, I'm going to find a real killer and, you know, play some golf and get on with my life.  And he really didn't talk about the family or anything.  Now, he's just going on shows, ah, Fred Goldman, hey, fuck him if he can't take a dead son.  What does he say about Fred?  Come on, kill me, pussy.  What does he say about Fred Goldman and how he didn't really like his son that much or didn't love his son as much as... 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, Simpson also took his cruelest pot shot to date at Fred Goldman, saying, quote,  he didn't care about his son when he was alive and accusing the dad of trying to make money off his son in the grave.  What is Fred Goldman waiting for?  And Fred Goldman's got to take this.  The accusations rolled off Goldman, who called Simpson a liar and a murderer.  Ooh, revelation.  You know how hard that's got to be, though, when you're waiting for money and it's contingent upon a black guy working? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my goodness.  That's why half the people love you and half the people hate you.  Boy, that was a good line.  Perfect example.  A great line.  It was...  There was some...  That guy...  You don't say that guy I called in doesn't hate me.  Don't worry about it.  I'm just messing with you.  No, no, no, no, but I'm saying he doesn't hate me.  Anthony, maybe this could be the latest game, like that JFK thing we were talking about yesterday.  See?  Everyone's up in arms about the JFK game, which I was playing yesterday.  Unbelievable.  I cannot now make the money shot.  That third shot.  You guys laughed at me yesterday. 
[00:45:00]  Because you were taking the wrong shot!  I was taking the best shot I had at Kennedy.  You know, a lot of new listeners, because they're turning on their radios every day, so it's the JFK game everyone's talking about.  You download the game online.  Yeah.  A lot of people just outraged.  You're in the window, sixth floor, book depository building, and the motorcade comes around the corner.  It's coming right at you, and then it turns kind of in front of you outside the window, and now you've got to take the shots.  I've been taking the shots at the front of Kennedy's face.  I know.  Anyone would have. 
[00:45:30]  Of course it's the best shot.  That's why Oswald had help.  Or didn't do it at all.  Everyone's saying.  So it now makes the turn, and now you've got to take the shot kind of through some leaves from behind.  Why would he wait to take the shot there?  Maybe because he was late.  All I could think of...  Maybe he got up to the sixth floor a little late.  All I could think of is if you're hanging out the window with a rifle, directly in front of them, somebody in the car, one of the Secret Service guys, might get a view of you.  See, that's why this game is great.  Because now you're in the same spot Oswald was, and you're not following the logic of the Warren Commission. 
[00:46:00]  Let me tell you something.  I now agree with the game maker.  At first I was like, kind of, yeah, this guy's full of shit.  It's just about getting this game out there.  It's a little sensationalism, and it's gory, it's morbid, it's...  Well, the guy's smart.  I mean, he's making money, and he's also figured out a way to make it kind of legit.  His whole thing on it, yeah, is saying that it's like a research tool.  It's some kind of research tool that the common man can now put himself in this situation and see how difficult it would have been to make that shot. 
[00:46:30]  And I've got to agree.  It kind of is interesting that it's so easy to take that front shot at Kennedy, and then when they make that turn, and now you're very high up.  Your angle from the window down to the car is a very steep angle.  And then from the back, with the leaves of the tree in the way, it's a very difficult shot.  So now I've been shooting the first shot and missing.  That's what they say the first shot did.  But you've got to miss in the right spot to get a point.  We've got to hit the curb, I think, under the overpass. 
[00:47:00]  Yep.  Next to that dude, whatever his name was.  James Tate.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  The second shot has to go through Kennedy and out and then hit Connelly.  Right.  Which I've done.  That would be the magic bullet, right?  Yep.  The magic bullet.  I did that.  And then the third shot, the money shot, I just cannot pull off.  I wind up hitting Jackie in the throat.  I hit Connelly's wife.  I cannot get that money shot.  The old busting head shot. 
[00:47:30]  Very difficult.  Does Anthony run out of the building where he could have?  No.  He stops and has a Coke.  You keep getting distracted up there, do you?  Sucking David Ferry's cock.  All painted in gold.  Wow.  Oh, what have we here?  Cage from Whackbag.com.  He photoshopped you as Oswald in a bunch of shots.  Very funny.  They're hilarious.  Go to Whackbag.com for some photoshop. 
[00:48:00]  That is a great one.  I see a trend happening, though.  I see a trend.  This game is kind of cool.  And why not have an O.J. game?  You could actually have O.J. at the murder scene, killing his ex-wife and Ron Goldman.  That would be interesting.  Your O.J.  You know, was it him or was it two people that were selling drugs to my ex-wife?  Was it two people?  It was Pedro Guerrero.  Was it Pedro Guerrero in the trunk with the drugs? 
[00:48:30]  Pedro Guerrero.  Was it one of the guys that was banging my ex-wife and driving around in my car that I bought the bitch?  Or was it me after, you know, use your mouse to circle around the house and watch my wife giving head to someone on the couch while I hit the outrage button on my computer?  This game is lovely.  I love this game.  You are O.J.  Do you choose your Bruno Mali shoes like I did that night to track blood up and down my pathway? 
[00:49:00]  Do you use your Heisman Trophy to take care of business?  You know, that's the beauty of this game.  I could either cut their throats or go way off the game plan and beat them over the head with my Heisman Trophy.  That is so much fun.  Look what happens when I press the B key.  The B key?  That's the bell the limo driver keeps ringing.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Oh.  Ding dong.  Hello, O.J.?  O.J.?  Ding dong.  O.J., I'm waiting out here. 
[00:49:30]  I'm in the limo.  I'm here to pick you up.  Ding dong.  O.J.  O.J.  O.J.'s not picking up.  Is he even...  Hey.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, O.J.'s running past my limo dressed all in black.  He's running behind the house.  No, I swear I know that's O.J.  Ding dong.  O.J.  Yeah.  O.J., where were you?  I was out back chipping golf balls.  No, but I saw you run past me in a black sweatsuit with a... 
[00:50:00]  No, no.  No, you didn't.  And you didn't see me drop no gloves, neither.  Or hit Kato's air conditioner.  None of that.  It's all included in my new video game, O.J. on a Killer Rampage.  Now you click the mouse button and drop the glove.  Oh.  Then you get on a flight.  Hey, look at us.  Get on a plane.  Hey, look at that.  Wow, look at us.  We're on the TV.  Holding up XM satellite equipment.  Oh, I thought that was the new Sirius Walkman. 
[00:50:30]  You were holding up.  Wow.  All right.  We'll get the audio of that newscast.  We're all over the news today.  All over.  Anyway, sorry, Anthony.  Took you out of the game.  That's all right.  I like the...  Another game, though, would be Ron Goldman getting to hunt O.J.  With the same crosshairs that you use in the Kennedy game.  Can he shoot me?  Was he shooting me from the clubhouse or from the grassy fairway?  Was there another gunman in the sand trap? 
[00:51:00]  As O.J. is just tooling around on a golf cart.  On a golf cart.  You got to take...  You're Ron Goldman's dad trying to take pot shots at him as he drives in his golf cart.  Well, with carolings there.  The motorcade makes his way.  No, the golf cart makes his way.  The golf cart motorcade is rounding the corner by the second hole.  Makes the turn at the halfway house after getting a hot dog.  I'll get a hot dog.  The first shot hits a divot and clips Kardashian in the face. 
[00:51:30]  AC's driving the golf cart.  Yeah, and my buddy Al Cowling is driving.  Yeah, Al Cowling.  It's a slow speed chase of my golf ball down the fairway.  I think I see a trend.  I'd play that game.  Who wouldn't?  Yeah, he's just got to kill him, though.  Where's the O.J. Crank calls?  He's such a pussy.  Fred Goldman. 
[00:52:00]  Just kill the guy.  Remember that guy that years ago his son was molested by some guy?  Karate instructor, and he shot him while he was on the phone.  Shot him right when they were bringing him into the court building.  That's how you do it.  This guy was standing by a pay phone like he's on the telephone.  The cops bring this molester by him, and they got it on video.  It's great.  He just spins around, one shot, right in the head, drops the gun, puts his hands up, like,  yep, there you go. 
[00:52:30]  Done.  My job as a father is complete.  You can't count on the court system.  Acquitted, too, by the way, as justifiable homicide, that guy.  There you go.  I believe.  Nice.  And it was.  And do you think Ron Goldman, I mean, Ron Goldman's father, what the hell's his name?  Fred.  Fred.  Fred.  Fred Goldman.  Do you think a jury down there in Florida, Florida, would really, you know, throw the  book at him?  He's just taunting Fred at this point.  He is.  I dare you to kill me.  That's his next quote. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, Fred, come and get me.  You're a pussy.  I laid a smack down on you.  Talking all kinds of shit.  Yeah.  Ron squealed like a stuck Irish pig.  Oh, man.  Anthony, we have the Kid Chris OJ prank calls.  We love this thing.  Oh, yeah.  Kid Chris, kind of a friend of the show.  One day he is, one day he's not.  I think today he's a friend of the show.  You don't find many sincere friendships in radio.  Not at all, but, you know, we love this thing. 
[00:53:30]  He actually got a hold of OJ and messed with him.  Yeah, he got OJ's cell phone number and was making little prank calls.  So, pretty funny.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is AC.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  OJ.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch. 
[00:54:00]  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on? 
[00:54:30]  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  OJ.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Juice.  Juice, what's up?  Who is this?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Hi, OJ.  It's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  Gotta go.  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, OJ.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Yeah.  Gone.  I love that.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Ouch. 
[00:55:30]  So there you have it.  The OJ prank calls.  Freenick?  Yeah.  Is saying, Anthony would play the OJ game by hacking at the back of their necks, wondering  why he couldn't get the high score.  Very funny, you ass.  Very, very good callback.  Maybe someone else mentioned the Andrea Yates game.  Oh.  And maybe you could play it by putting them all in sand.  Jesus.  You've got serious problems.  Why?  I'm the one that drowned those five little burdens. 
[00:56:00]  You've got serious problems.  I'm the one that...  I didn't do anything.  I just report.  Right.  Now I agree with that caller from Jersey.  You're awful.  He loves me, that guy.  Jerry from Michigan.  What's up?  I have to put on my fake mustache.  Oh, look how I threw the cops off.  A click of the mouse.  I hit the M key for the fake mustache.  Oh, no.  They're still after me.  Go, OJ.  Go.  I have to use the game's mapping system to find my mama's house, because that's where 
[00:56:30]  I'm headed.  I'm not going to Mexico with a bag of money, or am I?  You never know.  Play the OJ game.  Fucking OJ.  You know what?  You know something like that's going to come out eventually.  Jerry, what's up?  I've got a new game for you guys.  Okay.  It's a Ted Kennedy game.  We might as well keep it all in the family.  Yeah.  Why not make the Chappaquiddick game?  The Ted Kennedy driving game?  1969 Oldsmobile. 
[00:57:00]  Try to get across the bridge.  Oops.  See how long it takes you to get out of the seatbelt.  Get out of the car.  Tries to pull an evil Knievel.  Doesn't quite make it.  What does he do?  Do I click the mouse and save the broad, or go home and take a nap?  I say sleep it off.  It's been I'm drunk.  Wow.  I stood there by the shoreline until I saw the bubbles stop. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, jeez.  You've got to wonder what he did.  That would be great.  Like GTA, you're driving around, big fat Ted head in the back of the car.  Oops.  Here you come.  Simulating being drunk.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you can't, like, work the mouse to have him walk.  He's just staggering home.  Very hard to work the mouse.  Stagger home.  He swam across.  I keep trying to hit the alibi key, but nothing's coming up. 
[00:58:00]  It's not working.  He'll get off the hook.  Just hit that K key, the Kennedy name.  There it is.  Out of trouble.  Oh, brother.  Let's say hi to Eric in Jersey.  Hey, Eric.  Hey, what's going on, man?  We're hanging.  Last day before a little vacation.  Try to catch my game, where you try to walk your way through the kitchen.  Circumnavigate your way through pots and pans until you hear the crack of a gunshot. 
[00:58:30]  Or try my game, where you play football skiing down a mountainside.  Or how about mine, where you fly with a busted leg?  Can you land a plane in Martha's Vineyard as your new wife babbles behind you? 
[00:59:00]  She spilt my coffee.  Or play my game, where you beat a broad about the head with a golf club after jacking it in a tree.  Where in the world is Martha Moxley?  That's very pretty. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, boy, the Kennedys could have a bunch of games.  What are they outraged about the first one?  I could think of five more.  That would be a lot worse.  Oh, wow.  Try my game, where you give a lobotomy to your retarded daughter.  That only works.  That game only kicks in.  It's level two.  Level one of that game is when the hangar fails.  In the back room of the Kennedy complex. 
[01:00:00]  God, that was a good reference.  Uncle Ted makes an appearance in the other game, too.  Where you have to rape a girl on the front lawn of the compound.  You're forgetting one.  What did you just write? 
[01:00:30]  There's another Kennedy son that died.  That would be Joe.  Oh, what happened to him?  He crashed during what?  World War II.  World War II.  English Channel.  Oh.  See?  I didn't know the details.  He was supposed to be the president.  He was.  They were grooming him to be the president.  Oh.  And then they had to go with their second choice, JFK.  Look how that turned out.  You pulled out Michael, though.  That was a great one.  Yeah, Michael.  Michael Kennedy Smith was a fantastic one.  Michael Kennedy Smith. 
[01:01:00]  They love being like peripheral Kennedys and dropping that name in there.  Wouldn't you?  Greg Opie Kennedy Hughes.  Why not?  I would use that.  I want to be Anthony Kennedy Kumiya now.  Just for the fuck of it.  Why not?  So I can get away with stuff.  Yeah, I raped the bitch, but I'm Anthony Kennedy Hughes.  We're all related.  We're all related somehow, if you believe in Adam and Eve.  Sure.  Robert Kennedy Chambers.  Poor boy can't shake that awful girl's legacy. 
[01:01:30]  Let him get on with his life.  You choke a whore with a sweater and all of a sudden, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  You can't get out of jail and do drugs anymore.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  They caught him for drugs.  I know.  On the front page of the pump.  They caught him for.  The preppy killer was busted.  Isn't it awful to be an older guy now and be the preppy killer?  Yeah.  It was cool when you were the little preppy guy, but now he's like the old guy killer.  He's one of the best looking guys on earth, too.  He was like a nine and a half when he went to jail.  What a dope.  All that ass you were getting on the Upper West Side. 
[01:02:00]  He was nabbed in a traffic stop, and they found powder in his car, Anthony.  He was up in Harlem.  He was up in the Harlem area.  They pulled him over.  What?  No inspection sticker and suspended license, and then they found all sorts of powder in  his car.  You know, I still don't have my inspection sticker.  I picked up my car, I think, in August or maybe July, and I keep forgetting until I get  stopped at, like, the tunnel, and they point it out or write me a ticket. 
[01:02:30]  And this morning, I got yelled at at the Midtown Tunnel.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  I got yelled at at the Midtown Tunnel for going too fast.  But you know what happened?  There was a van in front of me, and he took one of the easy pass lanes, and I knew I had  to get through there in front of the van, or I was going to be stuck behind him the whole  time through the tunnel, which is just ponderous.  I like driving through the tunnel so it looks like...  It's like, I like the size of the tunnel to look like that scene in Battlestar Galactica  where they launch the fighter ship. 
[01:03:00]  I just like watching the walls whiz on by.  Just flying by.  Yeah.  And I wanted to get in front of the van.  So I go through, and I swear, the gate comes up a second before it hits my hood.  I love that.  So I go screaming through, and, uh...  Hey, hey!  And I stop like an idiot.  It's one of the Port Authority...  Tunnel.  The Tunnel Authority cops.  You know what this...  And then they got to quiz you at 4.30 in the morning.  You know what the speed limit is through the plaza?  I go 15. 
[01:03:30]  Why do they have to ask that question?  He goes, no.  I go, 10.  No.  Seven?  Five?  Seven and a half?  I go, five.  He goes, five miles an hour.  Those asses.  Why do they ask that when they pull you over for speeding?  Oh.  I go, I don't know the signs behind me now.  Right, right, right.  I was doing just fine.  Should have said 50 miles an hour?  Yelled at me.  Like it should be?  Because, you know, we got cameras here, and we can tell how fast you're going, and we'll...  Whatever.  Yeah, what? 
[01:04:00]  Whatever.  Eric, I don't know if it's going to make sense anymore, but you've been on hold for about  10 minutes here.  Oh!  What's going on?  No, I was just going to say, you guys should make a Sex for Sam game, where you have to  sneak around New York and have sex in different places.  You get caught, oh, and they get thrown off the air.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, that'll make us very happy.  Yeah, I play that one.  Well, thank you, Eric.  It will lead to the latest newscast we're on.  What happened?  Which one are we going on?  Say the line.  Sick puppy. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Sick puppy, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing today?  Hey, good.  I've got to tell you, first off, you guys are the only reason why you've even got XM Radio.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you.  Well, do us a favor and tell your friends, okay?  I'll go, and another thing, you forgot one important game.  What?  I thought William Shatnick killed his wife.  Oh, killing his wife.  Allegedly.  I never killed the bitch.  I just didn't go for help right away.  She's in the heat. 
[01:05:00]  She's got to leave her in the pool.  Does he call 911?  Does he pull her out of the pool?  No.  He stops and has a coke.  She's an idiot.  She was taking a drunken swim.  I had to watch her sink to the bottom.  Again, I, like Kennedy, just waited for the bubbles to stop.  Then I waved a pepper shaker over her and went, 
[01:05:30]  It said she was dead.  I can't believe it.  I called 911.  Hypothermia was setting in.  Time was of the essence.  Every friggin' time.  Yes.  Someone could die in a fire on rescue 911.  Time was of the essence.  Hypothermia was setting in.  They called 911. 
[01:06:00]  He's the host of Rescue 911,  and his wife drowned right there in the pool.  He didn't know what to do.  That burdensome wife.  No, he knew what to do.  Oh, he knew what to do.  He knew what to do.  One, 1,000.  Two, 1,000.  Honey, I'll call after the count of three.  One.  1,000.  Two.  I remember when I married you.  You were a beautiful woman.  Now you lay there at the bottom of a pool. 
[01:06:30]  Lifeless like Spock behind the glass when gone.  Set off the Genesis divide.  Gone!  Perhaps I should grab my communicator and call Bones.  Yeah, Bones, beam down to my pool.  My wife seems to be drowning.  Enterprise, hello.  Bones. 
[01:07:00]  Scotty.  I love how it's the future,  and he would turn dials on his communicator  and actually tap it.  Yeah.  Come on, Bones.  Pick up.  Hi, you've reached Bones.  No one's home right now.  Leave a message after the beep.  Beep.  Yeah, Bones.  My wife seems to be dying in the pool.  Perhaps, you know,  if you get this early enough,  give me a call back.  All right.  Hello?  I know you might be screening. 
[01:07:30]  I'm waiting.  You know, busy in sickbay.  Don't want to pick up.  Maybe trying to pick up on that bitch.  Remember that bitch you were with  and she turned out to be a salt-sucking monster?  That's a lot like my marriage.  That's why I'm letting the bitch drown in the pool.  She was a money-sucking monster.  I'd get my bills at the end of the month  and review them  and the horrified look on my face  was much like the look  when I looked out the window  and saw the monster on the wing. 
[01:08:00]  There's a man on the wing.  There's $5,000 dead on my Amex.  Same face.  The bubbles seem to be stopping.  All right, Bones.  Well, if you get this,  give me a call back.  Hi, Spock.  Your home pickup.  I'm starting to think  everyone's annoying me.  Spock.  Hello, Spock.  Maybe it's Amok time.  Every seven years, 
[01:08:30]  Spock gets horny,  gotta go back to Vulcan.  Is that what it is?  I know the pain it must be  for a being like you.  So logical  to be thrown into chaos like this.  That's how I felt  every time my Amex bill came in.  Bitch, but spend, spend,  spend, spend, spend.  Ooh, the bubbles did stop  and now she's got that  glazed overlooking her eye  looking up at me  from the bottom of the pool.  All right, Spock.  You get in.  Give me a call. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, it's a video game.  Oh, my God.  Just sitting back  and watching you go.  Rocks.  God.  Is that funny?  We can continue here.  There's a million of them  coming in now.  Rob from Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, how about  the Sonny Bono game?  You know, skiing down the slope,  trying to, like,  dodge all those trees.  Ah, the same one.  Trying to avoid the trees.  Wait a minute.  Imagine that two people  go the same way.  Two, like, famous people 
[01:09:30]  go the same way.  Hitting a tree.  That's why I never liked  watching Opie ski.  Because me skiing,  we went skiing once  and I'm too new at it  and I'm really bad.  So I, you know,  pizza pie wedge down the mountain.  I don't know what I'm doing  when I ski.  Opie's just reckless.  You and our old pal Jay, though,  scared the crap out of everybody  else that went that weekend.  It's because we were skiing  down a mountain  very slowly.  You decided to go  to the top of the mountain  just as the ski lists  were closing  and it took you 
[01:10:00]  well over an hour  to get down.  It was dark.  We walked down a mountain  on skis.  It was dark.  Yeah.  And we're going to  the first aid area  and everything  trying to find you guys.  We were drinking all day.  Smoking.  We're up on the mountain.  Yeah, one more cigarette  and we'll go down.  Awful.  And then Opie's just reckless.  Like he comes...  You think?  He's the guy that like  as you're just struggling  to stand up,  he comes...  Hey guys!  See you at the bottom! 
[01:10:30]  Thank you,  son of a...  That's how I  inline skate  in the park, too.  He's looking behind you.  In and out of cars  and everything now.  He looks behind him.  Make sure you're okay.  Ugh.  But I always worry  that you're going to  hit a tree.  No, I don't do that  tree skiing.  No?  No, that's what  Sonny Bono was doing.  Skiing,  are you using the trees?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of the  slalom, of course.  A lot of the kids  love tree skiing.  It's nuts.  You really have to  know what you're doing.  You see them skiing  down those rocks sometimes.  They go right over  the big boulders. 
[01:11:00]  That's a piece of cake  compared to when  they go in the woods.  Because, you know,  these trees come  at you fast, obviously.  Yeah.  And if you're not  turning really, really quick,  you're going to bite it.  Actually, I don't think  the trees are coming at you.  Well...  I could be wrong.  Yeah, but technically  it feels that way  when you're on skis.  And that would be  really dangerous.  Because when you're on skis,  you feel like you're  actually not moving  and everything else  is coming at you.  Coming at you.  I think a dolphin  could ski.  I think he could  maybe...  I think he could  snowboard before  he could ski. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, strap the fins  in a lot easier  than putting two  skis on one fin.  But maybe Sonny Bono  was just like skiing  a little, you know,  near the edge of the trail  and then, like,  you know, hit a rock  or something.  Right, because the trees  are right on the edge  of the trail.  I see the people  do that, too.  That's nuts.  But he was supposed  to be a pretty good skier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Here's Opie and Anthony  when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you.  What, what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are you all right?  San Diego.  You didn't get your sleep in? 
[01:12:00]  I got plenty of sleep.  Well, I was playing  that stupid JFK  shoot him in the head game.  You know what?  For hours and hours.  All the news stations  were just outraged  by this game.  Oh.  And, you know,  I was laughing  because we were talking  about it yesterday.  Basically, it's the JFK game.  Yeah.  JFK assassination game.  You know, all our listeners,  they're trying to find it.  Is there a link up  on OpieandAnthony.com?  There should be.  It's JFKReloaded.com.  JFKReloaded.com? 
[01:12:30]  JFKReloaded.com.  It costs like $10, though.  You've got to download it.  You could play a version  where you can't shoot him  or something for free.  It's ridiculous.  Why would you want to?  I know.  Just to get the view from...  Yeah, yeah.  You could, you know,  download it and get a view  like that.  But, you know,  I paid my fee yesterday  right when I got home  and popped it in  and talk about  a potato chip game.  It's just,  you've got to keep trying  to get a better score.  What's a potato chip?  What does that mean?  You just keep going.  You know how you can't  stop eating potato chips? 
[01:13:00]  They say that about  some of the games.  It's games that you just...  It's very simple.  There's not much to it.  The graphics are really good.  You're up in the sixth floor.  That's when you start the game.  You start off at the sixth floor.  You have a view  overlooking Dealey Plaza  and you have a little crosshair.  To zoom in through the scope,  you hit the right mouse button  and then you've got the scope view.  Zoomed in, crosshairs.  Nice.  Now, here it comes.  Around the corner,  you see the motorcades  start coming  and there's JFK 
[01:13:30]  and Jackie waving.  You've got Connelly  and his wife  sitting in front of them  and then the driver  and Secret Service guy  in the front seat.  And it looks just like  Dealey Plaza pretty much?  The view you've seen  a million times?  Yeah, the one thing  that they're missing though  is the crowd.  You hear a crowd of noises  but you really don't see  the crowds  on the sides of the street.  See, that would be cool  because when you're  messing up with the shooting,  they're pretty hilarious  to just take out  some innocent bystanders.  You hear it  but it's pretty much 
[01:14:00]  I guess they're concentrating  on the shots.  Now, the object of the game  because what they're saying  on the news,  they're not really giving you  the object is to  recreate what happened.  Your score is based  on your best recreation  of what actually happened.  I don't have a problem  with this one.  I don't either.  I loved it.  We've all talked about  the JFK assassination  for years and years  and years  and they've debated  whether Oswald  was able to do that  from that position.  So, of course,  why would you want to try  to see if you could do it?  41 years later,  the technology is there 
[01:14:30]  with your computer  to give some kind of a...  You can try it yourself.  See if it can be done.  Can you only look out  that one window  or can you look out  the other one  when he's coming up?  You can look out  the window  that right when he  turns the corner  to come into the plaza  before he takes the corner...  Coming toward you?  Yeah, he's coming toward you.  So, he's coming toward you.  The object to recreate it  as best you can.  You get points.  1,000 points  is the most you can get.  I got 485 out of 1,000 
[01:15:00]  was the best score I could get.  Sometimes I got negative points  because I just lost it.  Did you just panic?  I did.  He comes around the corner.  I'm like, alright.  He panicked.  He just starts firing.  The best score I got  was the one where I shot him  kind of in the neck first  with my first shot.  The second shot  went through Connolly's shoulder  and into his stomach.  Into Kennedy's stomach.  And the third shot  was just the money shot.  Very proud.  His head exploded  in a red mist.  His brains fell out. 
[01:15:30]  He slumps over.  And I felt so good  about myself.  You a handsome man,  Mr. Kulian.  And that was  one of my best scores.  And where the bullets end up  affects your score.  You get extra points for that.  You get extra points  for timing.  The timing between your shots  was accurate  like it was that day.  For not injuring Jackie.  For not injuring Connolly's wife.  Did you take her out  in some of your attempts? 
[01:16:00]  Well, let me tell you.  When I screwed up  a few of the shots  like the first shot  I knew it was bad  and I couldn't get  a good score.  I took out the driver.  The limo driver  and it just stops.  The car stops right there  in Dealey Plaza.  See, that's not accurate.  The car would still go  because it's downhill  at that point.  I don't know.  I think you need  the bystanders  so the limo goes  crashing into the bystanders.  When I shot the driver  the car just stopped  so I unloaded  into the car.  I killed Jackie.  I killed the wife.  I started shooting 
[01:16:30]  the cops that were  on the motorcade route.  They show blood  and guts and all that stuff?  Yeah, they do.  There's blood.  And then when you're done  they show you a film  and you could see  from any location.  You could see  what you did  from any of the locations  around Dealey Plaza.  Following the limo  from the grassy knoll.  Yeah, I was going to ask  do you have the option  to shoot from behind  the picket fence?  No, they don't.  I see them doing  some add-ons to this game  which is pretty cool.  One thing that they do 
[01:17:00]  also when you're done  they show you  bullet trajectories.  So they show you  very accurate  where your bullet went  in green  and then what it hits  and then afterwards  where it ends up  in red.  So you'll see a line.  Some of the shots  like just missed  Kennedy's head  and you can move  the car around  and see where  the bullet trajectory was  and see that you  just missed his head  or you can see  where it hit the limo  and ricocheted off.  So very accurate  as to where you 
[01:17:30]  put your shots.  And it's one of those  things where I was like  alright, I'll do this  a couple of times  and then I'll play  Ever Queer 2.  But after you're done  with one, you go  alright, I gotta try  one more.  I gotta try it again.  I gotta try it again.  I gotta try it again.  I got it two hours  I was just trying  to get my score up.  Then when I felt  confident, I went  online and participated  in their little  competition.  They have an online  competition across  the country where  you have 10 chances  to give it your  best shot.  I got 450 on the 
[01:18:00]  online competition.  Was that good though?  Compared to everyone  else?  It's good as far as  I killed Kennedy.  I injured Connelly.  I didn't hit Jackie  or Connelly's wife.  I left a bullet  where my second  shot ended up  where it was  supposed to be.  It was a fatal  head shot on Kennedy.  So, you know,  the score was...  I could see people  doing much better  with a little more  practice.  I gotta...  I kinda...  I can't remember  where the actual  shots went.  What was the first 
[01:18:30]  shot?  Do you remember?  It was a miss, right?  First shot was...  Well, that's if you  believe that there was...  See, that's just it too.  I think you're going  on the report.  I don't know if  they acknowledged  that there was  actually a missed  shot.  I know the one  bullet fragment  hit James Tagg.  The other bullet  supposedly, I think,  injured both of them.  Do they acknowledge  a missed?  Does the Warren  Commission  acknowledge that?  My brother's in  the studio.  He's literally an  expert.  Oh, okay.  This guy, he hangs  out on message boards 
[01:19:00]  and he's obsessed  with the damn thing.  Because I hate  fuckers, man,  and most of them  in this game,  you know, the whole  whatever, the  Warren Commission.  Yeah, Warren  Commission, the first  shot missed.  They acknowledged  that missed.  Yeah, they acknowledged  it.  It hits the curb,  hits James Tagg.  The second one  goes through both.  Third one hits him  in the head.  Wow, so now I got  a miss with the first  one in order to do  this accurately?  That's probably  we'll get your score  up.  I got a miss with  the first one.  The second one has  it.  Because there were  some times where  the first shot I hit  Connelly but missed  Kennedy.  So then the second  shot I had to hit  Kennedy without hitting  Connelly again. 
[01:19:30]  And the third shot's  the money shot.  That's why your score's  a little low.  That first shot's got to  be a miss.  And then there were  some times where I took  four shots, which is to add  to the, you know, you  lose points also for  doing anything over three  shots.  It starts minus like a  hundred points.  So there were some  times where Kennedy's  kind of injured but not  dead.  And the car's well past  my range where I could  shoot.  And I'm just laying  shots into Jackie's  back.  Call him to Parkland  Memorial.  Yeah, I'm out of the 
[01:20:00]  car.  They should really do  that with this game.  Just expand it to the  point you can just  fall into the hospital  and take care of  business.  Right now it's pretty  much, you know,  take care of business.  Suffocate him with  the pillow.  It's very entertaining.  Shoot Jackie for being  a distraction.  Juicy little ass of  hers.  Little pillbox hat  goes flying off her  head when I miss.  Oh, God.  You hear a little  whee. 
[01:20:30]  It's very entertaining.  It's very addictive.  Like I said, you just  keep going over and  over again.  But now I can't believe  I got a...  I was trying to hit  with that first shot.  Maybe that's what I got  to do to get that  score up.  Have you ever been to  Dealey Plaza?  No, I've never been.  It's a freak show.  We went on the 39th  anniversary two years  ago yesterday.  We were there.  And they have a whole  thing every year.  Whole thing.  And people come out  of the woodwork.  Like I was this...  They all have  photographs of who  they were.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's my brother,  man.  I'd love to meet 
[01:21:00]  some of them.  Beverly Oliver.  Oh, the Babushka lady.  The Babushka lady.  Yeah, she swears  she's the lady and she  shows where she was  standing and she's  signing autographs and  getting her photos taken  with everybody.  I mean, it's crazy.  And then there's obscure  people like, you see  this guy over here that  way up on the grass.  That was me.  And they'll tell you  what they remember  from that day.  Hey, the shot that  hit Connelly and  Kennedy.  Where did it go?  Don't even start there.  I know.  I know it was that  weird twisting bullet 
[01:21:30]  thing.  Magic bullet.  But Connelly was  genuinely injured.  Where was he hit?  It started down here.  In his lower back.  Yeah, near the armpit.  Near his armpit.  It went in kind of  elongated.  It went in from  behind.  Yes.  Now, this is where  I'm screwing up, too.  I'm taking the shot  from head on.  Now, I got to wait  until they make the  corner and hit him  from...  You're shooting when  they come down before  they make the turn?  Yeah.  Oh, you silly dude.  Hey, it's the best  shot, asshole.  It's the best shot. 
[01:22:00]  Why don't you just  go to Love Field and  pick him off when  they land?  That's why...  Because when you  were saying your score  was 450, I'm like,  I'm trying to be cool  here.  I'm like, well, that's  not really that.  good.  But because all I...  The only reason I'm  getting that score is  because I'm taking out  the targets.  You've got to wait  for it to make the  turn.  That's a rough  goddamn shot.  It's a whole  different game now.  Through the leaves,  through the tree,  you can't shoot.  That's tough.  You're shooting  on that.  Straight on is  perfect for the  head shot.  I know. 
[01:22:30]  Right when they  zoom around that  corner, when I see  him coming head on,  I'm on my rifle.  I'm taking my shot.  I mean, I understand  why you're doing it.  The truth's on your  side, Bubba.  Dude, what are you  doing?  I'm just trying to  kill the guy.  Why don't you just  shoot out the tires  before it makes the  turn?  Make it a lot easier.  That's a hard shot.  Okay.  They make the corner,  right?  Yeah.  Now, I have a shot  when they're turning,  as they're turning, 
[01:23:00]  from the side.  Now, that can't be  done either.  I don't think so,  right?  I tried it once,  and it went right  through Kennedy and  hit Jackie, who's  sitting next to him.  So, I've got to wait  now.  They slow down for a  very short period of  time when they make  that corner.  What was wrong with  that limo driver?  Yeah, bad move.  Very bad move.  I've got to rattle off  three shots after he  makes that turn.  After the turn, it's  all facing away from  you.  All right, let me  tell you something.  That thing doesn't  slow down for very long 
[01:23:30]  before they take off,  and then it's an  impossible shot.  Too bad you can't  shoot from the  knoll.  That would be  beautiful.  Maybe that's what  they're trying to  prove here.  Like, look, try  yourself.  This is impossible.  I've got to try  this now.  All right, let's  see what you do.  He's smiling and  waving, coming at  me.  I'm like, look at  his face.  I got the shot.  Too bad you can't  go to the hotel and  just poison him.  That'd be a little  bit easier.  You can't recreate  it and shoot him on  the way down.  What an ass I am.  You really are,  man.  I'm just on loan.  God.  I'm just taking the 
[01:24:00]  shot.  Okay, now I know  what I've got to do.  You should just run in  the street with some  chloroform.  A callback from an  old show.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, if we would  have had a computer  here and I would  have demonstrated, it  would have been  funny to see Jim go,  what are you doing?  Of course.  You can't shoot him  now.  Dude, even I know  that.  And I'm stupid when  it comes to that  stuff.  I have cancer on my  neck.  I've had it for  years.  This is Louisiana,  boss.  Who do you know 
[01:24:30]  who your daddy is  because your mama  told you so?  Yeah, the only  applause, though,  it's a freak show  every year.  They come out of  the woodwork and  they sell all sorts  of stuff.  What about the happy  people sitting on the  X taking pictures?  All like group  hugs.  There's an X on the  street where he was  shot.  They paint an X there  and people like taking  their pictures.  Smiley kids.  Like, hey.  Yeah.  I got a shot on the  X suite.  He took one of me.  I just stood there  like I was having a  moment, but it was  great.  Yeah, right on the  X.  Were you looking up at  the window?  I don't remember. 
[01:25:00]  I was just really  embarrassed.  I was just taking the  fucking picture.  I'm humiliated just  standing there, but  we got it done.  You actually got your  picture with a place.  But every year there's  There are people there  24 hours a day selling  all the conspiracy  stuff.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  And there's like,  I mean, do you remember  some of the conspiracy  stuff that was just  the ridiculous ones?  I'm going to go and  open a little booth.  I'm the guy that took  the shot from the front.  Right.  That's my theory.  Jack Ruby was at  like a hot dog stand  shooting and they have  pictures of all of them.  Oh, guys are garbage.  It's just ridiculous. 
[01:25:30]  And these people swear  on it too.  Like, look, I got proof.  Jack Ruby was at  the hot dog stand.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Natalie Oliver is the  guy.  She claims she was  filming from that  angle, right?  Yeah.  And the FBI agent  took her camera or  something.  I don't know if she's  a whack job or not.  I walked up to her  with our brother Quinn  and said, you're a  handsome woman.  She's like, I've never  been called handsome  before.  And she just, she's  holding court over  like hundreds of people  just listening to her.  It's crazy.  You have no idea if  she's telling the truth  and all these rubes  are there like, really?  Oh, people that just 
[01:26:00]  want to buy everything  and believe everything.  Like, talking to  these people like  they're doing their  own investigation.  She's a very famous  person, though,  associated with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Someone is saying  there's a bonus level  in the game.  I heard Hank Bowery  will show up every  once in a while.  My brother knows it  all.  He argues with these  freaks almost weekly.  We were calling Jimmy  from there, remember?  You were like leaving  him weird messages  and I was doing things.  Phil from New Hampshire,  what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  If you put the blood  option on and you score 
[01:26:30]  over 900 points,  there's a hidden level.  Really?  What does it do?  You end up in a plane  with your wife and you  have to try and land a  plane at Martha's Vineyard.  Oh, that's funny.  That was pretty funny.  Later, guys.  It turns into a flight  simulator.  You have your yapping  wife behind you.  Oh, my God.  Hello, John, John.  That's good.  Let's say hi to Dan in  Jersey.  What's up, Dan?  Then you've got to rape  a girl on the front lawn  of a compound.  Dan? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Hey.  I just want to,  Anthony, the second shot  hits Connelly.  Yeah.  To go through JFK first.  Right.  It goes through JFK first  and then hits Connelly.  And then it goes through  which is impossible  from the front.  That's so funny.  You're shooting from the  front.  I'm ricocheting off a  building.  I'm trying to get it to  come back at him.  Yeah.  I'm really using the  magic bullet.  Makes a U-turn. 
[01:27:30]  That's fantastic.  You're incorporating the  matrix in your gameplay.  I like level three where  you've got to beat a  teenage girl with a  golf club.  You jerk off in the tree.  It's extra points.  Let's go to Clay in New  Orleans.  Clay.  Oh, Clay.  New Orleans.  Hello, Clay.  Clay, Bertrand.  Anthony, I'm really  disappointed.  You're concerned with an  undesirable classic  character.  All right. 
[01:28:00]  You know exactly when  to punch out.  You know.  All right.  Well, we'll try the new  way and let's see if your  score can get a little  higher.  I will so try the new  way.  I wish we had our gear  here.  That would be great.  Our computers and stuff.  We'd be in that office for  hours.  Well, I've got something to  play for you.  All right.  Because you guys do have  this obsession with Mike  Brady.  Oh.  What's an obsession?  Pretty obsessed with him.  Maybe.  Sure.  Here's him describing the 
[01:28:30]  first time he ever kissed a  girl.  Really?  To one of the kids.  Yeah.  From the Brady Munch.  Hi, sweetheart.  You like my dress?  Mom, can I talk to dad for a  minute?  It's kind of a father  something.  Oh.  Well, since I don't really  know where to start.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the  beginning?  Well, dad, did you ever  kiss a girl when you were  my age?  Yeah.  Wow.  Long pause. 
[01:29:00]  Well, uh...  For Christ's sake,  say something.  Make me, Bobby.  Bobby?  It's a father something,  dad.  Stop.  Come on, Bobby.  Come up to the bathtub  with me.  Let me smell your breath.  Long pause.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the  beginning?  Well, dad, did you ever  kiss a girl when you were  my age?  Ah! 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, I kind of remember  that I did, huh?  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  Yeah, I throw up.  Her father walked in the room.  I found him much more  attractive.  So he's stuck in my keister,  and look at me now,  losing weight rapidly.  It's the story of a man  named Brady, and he's  wearing pants that get  looser by the day...  How about the beginning? 
[01:30:00]  Well, dad, did you ever  kiss a girl when you  were my age?  Yeah, I kind of remember  that I did, huh?  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  I mean, how'd you feel?  Like, did you see  skyrockets or something?  Oh, skyrockets came later.  Right up my ass. 
[01:30:30]  Well, not skyrockets,  exactly.  Uh, a few little  firecrackers, maybe.  Well, if you did see  skyrockets, would that  mean you're in love?  I mean, that depends.  It could.  People who are in love  get engaged, right?  Yeah, well...  And then they get married.  Well, I think in your case...  Well, I think in your case  I'd recommend a long  engagement. 
[01:31:00]  How long?  About ten years.  Some love and marriage  and engagements,  it's a wonderful business,  but you want to make  very sure about  those skyrockets.  Make sure.  Thanks, dad.  I'll keep in touch.  And by the way...  You do that.  Those weren't firecrackers,  they were T-cells exploding.  A little something for you guys  and your obsession  with Mike Brady.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  We can't stop talking about him.  This is hilarious.  Oh, with his little robe  and slippers.  Last days,  walking around the hospital.  65 pounds.  Oh, oh.  Why couldn't I have liked girls?  Opie and Anthony  XM202.  It's the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Mark from Virginia.  What's up? 
[01:32:00]  Hey, man.  I got to defend  little Jimmy.  What's that, fella?  Hey, I got to defend  little Jimmy, man.  You're the man.  Without you, man,  it wouldn't be a great show.  Oh, and hey,  you got a great show, man,  but you got to keep  little Jimmy in there.  Thank you.  We're keeping little Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I don't want to get fired.  We just want him  to fart less.  That's all.  Hey, man,  he's got to relieve  some pressure from somehow.  He can't just whip out  his mule and do it  right there in the show.  Thank you, sir.  That's exactly what...  And I get very excited  sometimes.  It just sneaks out. 
[01:32:30]  I don't mean to ruin the show.  There you go, man.  He pops...  You're my idol, little Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  He pops boners  all the time.  So what?  It's all he goes  with good things.  Dude, but you have  to show everyone.  He gets our attention  and he grabs on  to it.  We're trying to enjoy  the freaking 20-year-old  stripper from L.A.  And all of a sudden  we're all like,  what?  What has he got?  And then we're looking  at your hog again.  You don't have to look.  Well, when you're like  jumping up and down  like you might have something.  I don't jump.  I just kind of point  and you guys choose to look.  I don't jump.  He definitely tries 
[01:33:00]  to get your attention.  He lifts it over  the edge of the console.  And rests it.  He grabs,  pulls it sideways  and shakes it a little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want a little  extension built  around his area.  A mule hider?  Yes.  A mule hider.  Exactly.  A mule hider.  It's perfect height  where he can just  plop it on the table.  It does.  He lays it on there.  I do rub it  against this thing.  It's perfect.  I'll have some  of the Norton wiener.  You can't out-gay  Norton, though.  It's not a gay thing 
[01:33:30]  when I do that.  I'm usually turned  on by a woman.  It's not like I'm just...  You can't.  If you try to...  He'll try to hug me  or something.  I understand  what Bob Kelly's  saying, though.  Yeah.  You know, out-gay.  I mean, you like  to try to get  that reaction  by doing something  that would be  perceived as gay.  No, I don't.  One time, I actually...  You know, he does  gay things once in a while  and it freaks you out.  And one time, I was like,  you know what?  I'm going to out-gay him.  And I actually...  You can't out-gay him.  I stuck my finger  right near his butt  and he actually stopped  and backed up  and my finger  went in his asshole.  And I...  Your pants.  I just... 
[01:34:00]  How many knuckles  did he get in there?  It was one and a half.  Yeah.  It was like a little shrimp.  I could actually  bend my finger.  That did not happen.  He just stopped  and then he went like this.  Ooh.  He tried to put his finger  by my ass  and it's like,  look, you're going to learn  a lesson the hard way.  Why are your pants down  at this point?  No, no, no.  My pants were on.  Easy, easy, Opie.  Why do you get a finger  that off?  We were walking in the hallway  in the apartment.  I asked how many knuckles  you took.  You took a knuckle  and a half through the jean?  I would actually  take something real,  enhance it,  exaggerate it.  Therein lies the ha-ha.  Yeah, he didn't mean  it.  I didn't mean 
[01:34:30]  I stuck my finger  in his ass.  That would be gay,  wouldn't it?  He put it against my ass  and I just backed up  against it to teach him  who was boss.  He learned a lesson.  Well, you should have told me  it was exaggerated humor.  We don't know.  I thought that's what humor was.  Not all the time.  Really?  What's the other type of humor?  Dude, we've all seen him naked  so it was quite possible  that actually happened.  Don't look at me  like I'm an alien.  That's an exaggeration too.  I've never seen Jimmy naked.  There you go.  Alright, show him your hug.  I don't want to.  No, I won't show him my hug.  I don't want to see Jimmy naked.  I love the face he gets  when he gets...  I was actually with him  one time  and he gets this face. 
[01:35:00]  His eyes just open wide  and his head turns down  and his upper lip  goes underneath his back tooth  and he just looks  like a little troll  and he just doesn't blink.  Like Christopher Walken  in the scene  and he just stares  at the girl like,  yeah.  Yeah, it is nasty.  Oh, he does.  It's just evil.  He is his little body.  Alright, you know,  no one's really  screening the calls today.  The behind the scenes  people are very, very slow.  Very, very slow. 
[01:35:30]  We're all tired.  Hello, who's this?  Oh, that was good.  A hang-up.  I'm going to do it myself.  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  Hey, oh, it's...  What?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Oh, what's going on?  Hi, fella.  I was going to set up  for a...  What did I learn?  But it's a little too early.  Yeah.  I was going to hold on...  Hold for a while, but...  You were going to hope  to hold for about 45 minutes?  I guess so.  I'll do one a little early. 
[01:36:00]  For some reason,  Jimmy Norton plays  Monster Rain just fine,  but today,  a little sticky banana juice  got his nerves up  for some reason.  Yeah, that's true.  It is inconsistent,  but it freaked me.  I didn't know what it was.  It was probably sitting  in the deli or something,  and God knows  what those savages  spill on their fruit.  By the way,  we did get a brand new  Monster Rain song.  How many is that?  This is at least...  Number four?  Oh, my God.  It's not that...  It's...  It's...  It's bad.  Is it bad?  Listen, we'll all judge.  All right.  Another Monster Rain song.  We weren't going to go to it,  but the guys are kind of 
[01:36:30]  asleep behind the scenes today,  so...  That's right.  Look at them.  Look at them.  They're not even moving.  They all...  You know what it is?  They want to be punished.  They need discipline.  This damn Rent Boys thing  has backfired.  Now everybody's fucking off  hoping to get a reading.  Steve records the thing  in stereo.  We need the phone screened.  Isn't it obvious  we're suffering here?  Yeah, we're tired, man.  Get fucking people  on the phones.  I'm not even kidding anyone.  Get them on the phone, Ben.  No one is screening the calls, really.  It's like slow motion.  Get my mother back on the phone.  Have her do that...  It's been the same thing again. 
[01:37:00]  We got six phone lines ringing.  We got two guys  that have been sitting  and it's nothing  we want to go to.  It's boring shit.  Here's the Monster Rain song.  Tell me when to stop.  Let's give a listen.  It really is bad.  Let's listen along.  Oh.  Neil Diamond.  He's done to Neil Diamond.  Love on the porch. 
[01:37:30]  So far, so good.  I was surprised.  Little drizzle  and out came his lies.  What?  Come run with me  Before the dark  Takes the sky  It's getting a little abstract,  I think.  You took my heart 
[01:38:00]  You took my soul  Gave me a little tea  I even played with my own  Rhymes  And since gone  But I gave Jimmy  His smile  An hour  A little rough  We'll give it like 30 more seconds  Big car  First the sky  Is they talking 
[01:38:30]  Then Jimmy  Starts his talking  Suddenly you're  Under the porch  Hiding from the storm  The fear  Makes him have you  That he wants to have you  Nothing you can do or say  Once he starts  You have to stay  It's the monster rain 
[01:39:00]  This guy's all over the place  Can we end it?  End it?  Give me what I need  Yeah, he's breaking all the rules  Makes me no choice  He's breaking all the parody rules  Yeah, he's really singing  Some parody rules are like  First of all, you've got to be able to hear what you're saying  There's a couple of lines there that are a little  Wuffled  Yeah, you couldn't really hear it  Second one  You don't use that many of the lines from the real song  Right  The guy's using too many of the real words to the song 
[01:39:30]  It's like a parody slash audition for like  As a real singer  Yeah, yeah  Neil Diamond cover band  Yeah  Well, it's dug out Doug  Did you ever come up with  He does a pretty good Neil Diamond  I'll say  Did you ever have a monster rain story?  Did you come up with one yet?  No  You heard my story, right?  No, what was yours?  Oh, you weren't listening the other day  He had the marshmallow  In the frat house  Which people are saying is just as bad as the monster rain  Of course it is  I was out in Arizona last week  I missed the whole show  It's one of those things where you're hazing for a fraternity 
[01:40:00]  And one of the things you got to do is  Pull the pants down  Pick up a marshmallow  Yeah  With his ass  And drop it  And drop it on a little mock  A rivalry  A fraternity house  Frat house  And then no one ate it?  No  No, you sick ass  Come on  I didn't  But it's a room full of guys with their pants down  See? That's it?  It's a room full of guys with their pants down  Picking up things with their buttholes  Look who says that to it  The guy that put a finger in my ass  Well he didn't  Well I guess Mike Cracky did  No, you had your pants on 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, but I felt the actual shrimp hole  The actual  Separation  Yeah  I'm guessing there's a Bob Kelly story  That bombs you?  I thought it was a little odd  That frats do things like that  And have guys in these nude circumstances  Doing things  Yeah, I think  There's definitely a Bob Kelly story  Yeah, there's definitely a Bob Kelly story  Now let me just get this straight  Is it like just pure molestation?  Does it have to be a guy?  Or can it be a girl?  Or an aunt?  No, we all have girl stories  How old would the boy be? 
[01:41:00]  And how old would the aunt be?  Oh, jeez  What the hell is an aunt?  I don't like it either  It's from Boston  I'm from aunt  It's an aunt  Aunt  What do you say, aunt?  Yeah, aunt  If I say aunt  Then he's going to go what?  And then it's going to be like  A whole back and forth  Who's on first?  Aunt  Oh, marshmallios  Listen  My aunt, aunt  What?  What?  Aunt  I've done a couple things  I guess we were talking about things that could be  Yeah, you got to do the gay one  Looked at as  A little gee 
[01:41:30]  A little gee  A little gee  Well, I used to  We got shards of glass  You broke a CD and it just made shards  You alright?  Yeah, I'll be alright  That's what you get  Alright, relax  Easy  I should settle down, huh?  Settle down  Now, what do you got?  Why don't you settle down  Find a girl like Henry  Tell us your gay story  It's not gay  Only the good half  It's not gay because it was young  Settle down every night, ma  It was young  You were young  Yeah, well that's  That's the whole monster ain't excuse 
[01:42:00]  Jimmy gives  Is it's not gay  Because he was young  Well, it's true  Everybody  Everybody  Four out of five  Young boys  Have done stuff with  Their buddies' peepees  When they're young  Because you don't know what sex is yet  And the fifth one watches  That's what my therapist told me  Really?  Yeah, that it's pretty natural  Really?  Well, when you were  How old were you?  And whatever  So I guess I'm not normal  Oh yeah, you are  You're so normal  You probably repressed it  But there's a normal memory  I honestly couldn't  Couldn't give you one though  It's gonna come out someday  I don't know  I forgot all about 
[01:42:30]  The marshmallow story  So I guess we'll see  I'm sure there's more in there  Alright, go ahead  How old were you?  How old was I?  I think I was  I had to be in first grade  First grade  First grade  That's six  Actually, yeah  It was before first grade  My first sexual experience  With a woman  Was in first grade  And with this chick  The blouse  This local whore  And she made me  Whore?  Yes, the blouse  How old was she?  She was like  She had to be like 14  Oh  So she was older  And she took me in the bushes  Yeah  And made me suck on her tits  And then she played  With my little mushroom 
[01:43:00]  Like she just played with it  Wow  And I went home  What a little whore  I actually cried all night  Because I thought  God was going to punish me  And he was going to  And he did  What a good Catholic  I remember me and my  You cried all night  Because of that?  Well, you know  I was raised Catholic  That's horrendous  Of course  And I didn't know  She's touching me  And I'm sucking  She made me do this stuff  I was molested  You were molested  And then I went home that night  And I was just crying in my bed  Just crying  Praying for God  Please forgive me 
[01:43:30]  I'm sorry  This is bad  Are you kidding?  And my mother actually came up  She was like  Honey, what's wrong?  I was like  Nothing  I'm just  You know  I had a bad dream  And I just cried all night  I just felt bad  Thank you, man  I just had to  You know  Make this story  A little more fun  Yeah  Porn  Porn  Porn  Alright  So you're crying in bed  Let dirty boy  Finish your story  You know  What's funny  Is like a week later  I actually  You do understand  It was your fault  It was my fault 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  Why?  It was your fault  She took me into the bush  And made me  What are you expecting  To parade that little  Hairless jewel around  Who wouldn't touch it  For Pete's sake  She used to take me  Into Tufts University  And after that  I kind of got into it  And I used to grab  My friend Matthew  We used to go up  Into the attic  Of Tufts University  And just  Each one of us  She was fat  Just fat  And huge tits  And each one of us  Would just suck on a tit  Wow  Like little babies  Like little 
[01:44:30]  You were little babies  Yeah  It was just this hot  Sweaty attic  And this fat chick  And she was just sweating  And me and him  Would just both grab  One of our huge tits  And just suck on a  And was she getting  Pleasure out of this  Was she moaning or something  No, not really  She would just sit there  Sometimes she'd smoke  During it  I swear to God  She'd just light up a cigarette  It was weird  Like she would  She would just  Do it with everybody  My first three chicks  Were just fat  White chicks  The Blouse  Kimba  And some other chick  I don't know  Kimba  Kimba, yeah  She would just 
[01:45:00]  Where's the guy thing  Come in  Oh, when I was before  No, you know  When I was after that  You're trying to tell chick stories  And you're like  Where's the guy stuff  I kind of like  The Blouse story  Yeah, thanks, man  That was nice  I mean, Ope  Sorry  Nice talking to you  Wanted to, you know  Keep you on track  Alright  Well, you know what happened  Is that me and my friend  We would go over to  He would come over to my house  Because both of my parents worked  And my sister would be out  So we'd just lie on the couch  Uh-oh  That's already  And  Oh, boy  Buckle up  Buckle up  Here comes another monster rain 
[01:45:30]  This is way beyond monster rain  I can sense it  I don't know  Why you call it monster rain  Why don't you just call it  Sucking each other's cocks  And being friends  Well, the more  The more I look at it  The more I realize  That there probably was  No such thing as monster rain  I've come to that conclusion  Oh, really?  You're backing out of stuff now?  What are you saying?  No  I didn't know that you guys  Grew up together  No, easy  What I was saying  If me and him were buddies  When we were a kid  We'd have some  Dude, remember that time  I banged you on your ass?  Alright, listen  That wasn't gay though  I talked to my therapist 
[01:46:00]  That's not gay  We just didn't know any better  We're friends, you know  Alright, so  So you and your friend  Would lie on the couch  We'd lie on the couch  Just before I  How old was he?  Uh, 13  How old were you?  No, I'm joking  He was, uh  Ah, shit  We had to be  We had to be  How old were you in 5th grade?  How old were you in 5th grade?  11  I don't know  It depends what color you are  No, not 11  11?  No, it wasn't 11  What color you are?  You were 11 years old  Hang on, I didn't even hear that  That's so bad  That's good  Um  You were 11  I wasn't 11 
[01:46:30]  Opie, it's not 11  Because I was in  You graduate 6th grade  You're 12 years old, right?  Yeah  Yeah  So you're 11 in 5th grade  It must have been  You were 11  4th grade  I wasn't 11  Because I started drinking at 11  10 or 11  And I wasn't drinking then  Of course you started drinking  This is my first edition  This is my first edition  Then I moved on to booze  So what happened  When you were almost a teenager  Laying on the couch  Yeah, lie on the couch  We just lie there  And this is when  Remember when you first started jerking off  You used Vaseline 
[01:47:00]  Yes  Remember like petroleum jelly?  Sure  Yeah  Like waterproof your dick  For like 3 days  Just jump in the shower  To wash it off  And it would just beat up  Yeah  Just looking for anything slippery  At that age  Didn't matter  Run around like a monkey  Just looking what?  Pancake batter?  I don't care  Whatever works  I jerked off with anything  Anything  Anything  I used to jerk off with the Juergens  And I'd fuck the sink  You ever fuck the sink?  I can't say I've ever done that  If you ever want to jerk off  And it feels like you're fucking somebody 
[01:47:30]  You get on  You know the big long sinks  In the bathroom  The counter?  Yeah  You can't have like a pedestal sink  How small is your dick?  Listen to me  It's a sink  Wait it's the way you pull the little thing out  That seals your drain off?  No you don't fuck the sink sink  You lie on the counter  It has to be a counter with the sink in the middle  Oh oh  You lie down and you put your  You put your hand here  It's almost like a ditch  It's a ditch  And you put your hand on the edge  You lube up your hand  And you push your hand in  And then your hand is stationary  And it all goes in the sink 
[01:48:00]  And you get the fuck  And then it goes right in the sink  You're a genius  It's unbelievable  You are a genius  Oh it's unbelievable  It really feels like you're fucking somebody  I swear to God  I'm not going to be able to look at a sink ever again  No  That is brilliant because there's no clean up  You're getting  You're able to use your whole body in it  You open your eyes  And you're looking right at yourself in the mirror  How fucking creepy is that?  I'm a fat bald chick I'm fucking  I got caught in rehab  When I went to rehab  I got caught fucking the sink 
[01:48:30]  I used to fuck the sink  During our group sessions  Because I know everybody was in the group  So one time I guess  Somebody snapped in group  And they had to end group early  And I'm in the bathroom  Fucking the sink  And there was like a crack in the door  And all of a sudden  I just hear giggling  And like all ten guys  From my rehab house  Oh man  Were in there  They were just watching me  Fuck the sink  It was just awful  So you still do that?  I haven't done it  Because I have a pedestal sink now  You can't do that  Yeah you can't do that  I'm too fat to balance myself 
[01:49:00]  On a pedestal sink  But yeah I've done it  I've done it in hotel rooms  You ever go into hotels  You have to go into cheesy hotels  But the suite  In like a cheesy hotel  Yeah  Always has that big long counter  With one sink  Little sink in the middle  Yeah perfect  Just jump up on top  You lube your hand up  Don't  Don't lube your dick up  No?  No because you want to lube  Just the inside of your hand  Put it on there  And then when you push it in  It's like cracking the seal  Of a real pussy  You want a little resistance  You want a little resistance  Because it cracks it 
[01:49:30]  And you're like  And it feels like you're cracking  The seal of a stink wrinkle  Just as it's going in  Oh it's unbelievable  Right now there's a sink in therapy somewhere  I just wanted to clean people  And help and wash them  And this fat kid would climb on  And put his dinghy in my face  Well I was in the bathroom  Where I usually am  And the lights came on  These are great distractions  So what happened with the guy  On the couch  Yeah that's true  So uh  Fucking the sink  I've never heard of him  So you were almost a teenager  Naked with another boy

[01:57:30]  Yeah but she was retarded  You're stupid  She was retarded  Tell her  Don't laugh at me  Stop laughing at me  Stop laughing at me  Ik ben ben, ik ben ben, ik ben ben, ik ben ben.  Audio from the Kelly's basement.  Ze used to follow me home every day.  And one day, I actually... 
[01:58:00]  You didn't have sex with a retard.  Well, one day.  There's actually two stories.  I brought her home.  She brought me home.  I mean, I brought her home.  She followed me home.  This is where we get the gay out of the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  Sex with retards.  Only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Take a promo out of that.  She used to follow me home.  I think it was seventh grade.  So one time, I let her come home with me because my mom was out.  How retarded was she?  Was she a slow girl in school or was she like...  She was the fat kid, the fat girl with the greasy hair and the straight bangs.  I was going to say, the Pete Rose haircut? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Pretty retarded.  But she wasn't like her body...  She wasn't mongoloid?  She had like a big, like a silverback gorilla forehead.  It's long but short and angled.  Gotcha.  And she had like...  But not Down syndrome.  Little volcano tits.  You know what I mean?  A fat gut but just volcano tits.  I was in seventh grade, so I don't know.  You were 13.  13.  Now you're officially a teenager.  You moved on from sucking men off to having sex with retards.  And you wonder why you're in therapy.  Trying to cleanse the palate. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  Literally speaking.  When did you finally get up to Hot Chicks?  Last year?  No.  Yeah.  Actually around 20.  20.  When I got sober, I finally got...  I was like, great.  This is great.  The sober thing really...  Why is every comedian recovering something?  Because they have experiences like this that you got to drink away.  Exactly.  Exactly.  The second you were sober, before you got sober.  Yeah.  I mean, like before you got a drink that day.  Yeah.  Would these things just creep in and you were like, oh my god, I need a drink so bad?  I used to hang out with these guys. 
[01:59:30]  They were all from South Medford.  Italian, mafia type guys.  All kick ass.  And I would be around them all the time and have these thoughts would enter my head.  And I would get so uncomfortable, it almost came out.  If they only knew, they would throw me out of this little...  Oh, I'd be killed.  They'd beat the hell out of me.  Alright, so you're 13.  She's 7?  No, no, no, no.  She's my age.  You're a friggin' lunatic.  Stop enhancing the story.  That's why there was a question mark.  I can't believe he can make the stories worse, but he is.  There was a question mark. 
[02:00:00]  Was she 7?  I'm getting confused here.  She's older.  Oh, 7th grade.  She had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old.  You sick F.  Yeah, that's true.  Did she talk all weird?  She did.  You're stupid!  Was it like that?  Yeah, she was like that a little bit.  So I took her back to my house.  You know, there's a guy in Ohio checking in, and I agree with him.  The show is two weeks away from a guy doing the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  No!  Dude, this has to end. 
[02:00:30]  I'm really getting pissed off about this.  It's just, you know what it is?  It's therapy session.  Why does all of Jimmy's friends have to come in and admit their gay experiences?  I don't know.  We did kind of pull it out of him.  You sat there.  Dude, you started off like...  You started off when we...  Left it right in his mouth.  I tried to sidetrack with Pussy eight times.  Yeah.  And you kept going, all right, get back to the...  We started off with one of the hottest girls we've ever had on the show.  From me?  We wanted to bow to you, and now we want to shun you, man.  Now you realize what would happen if you bowed to him.  Oh, my God. 
[02:01:00]  Can we get past the sex with retard thing?  Well, no, the retard is a girl, so...  She's a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Sure she is.  She's just a little retarded, and she claps like this with her wrists.  So I took her in the basement.  I made her jerk me off with that old, really harsh soap with the little grains of...  Lava?  Yeah, lava soap that you wash oil off your hands.  You love punishing yourself.  It's got granules in it.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  How?  She's jerking me off, but she's just, you know... 
[02:01:30]  I cleaned off with a Brillo pad.  She kept going, is this how I do it?  Is this okay?  Is this okay?  It hurts in my hand.  Asking those same questions you were asking just a year prior.  Turn your hand over, stupid.  Easier fucking a sink.  So I looked up in the window in the basement, and I saw my mother's car pull up.  Uh-oh.  So I said, wait here, wait here, and I just ran upstairs, and my mother came home with my aunt,  and I'm talking to her, and I'm so nervous, and then I'm sitting on the couch watching TV, 
[02:02:00]  but I fell asleep.  Oh, no.  Around four hours later, I woke up, it was dark out, and I was like, oh my God, I forgot all about her in the basement.  I ran around the back, and you know those tornado doors, like the angled doors for the basement doors?  I opened it up, and this poor retarded girl was just sitting there shivering.  She still had soap on her hand, the fucking gooky soap, and she's shitting there shivering like,  I gotta go home.  I was supposed to be home a long time ago. 
[02:02:30]  I gotta go home.  All right, retard, finish the job first.  You can go.  Did you make her finish?  No, I didn't make her finish.  But another time I saw her, my friend actually held a rock over her head until she jerked both of us off.  All right, I like that.  Oh my God, you're a criminal.  I'm not me, it was my friend.  You're an accomplice.  No, I'm not.  I told her not to do it.  No, it's not.  It's a retarded girl.  She thought it was fun.  She thought it was to hold the rock over the head game.  Hey, we want to thank Don Kelly for stopping on by today.  Why didn't you do that? 
[02:03:00]  Why didn't you spend all of your love?  Why didn't you do that?  You can hear more.  Why didn't you spend all of your love in me?  Put the rock down.  Please, put the rock down.  Bob, where could people hear more gay stories?  It's not gay, open.  Will you stop that?  Will that be at the Stress Factory?  You can go to robertkellylive.com.  There's a lot of dirty stuff on there.  And the Stress Factory in New Brunswick this weekend, Friday and Saturday, two shows.  Love you guys.  Can I ask a question?  What?  I want to know if the guy made you do it by going, 
[02:03:30]  He puts the cock in his mouth.  He does this when it's told.  He does this when it's told.  It's not gay if you do it thumb and forefinger first.  You've heard the Silence of the Lambs song, right?  Yes, it's very funny.  We'd love that one.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Say, Jim, nice meals.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  Well, Anthony, the list of dangerous toys is out.  Oh, Christmas.  Is out.  Every year there's a bunch of toys that are made and get recalled.  And they get recalled as a public. 
[02:04:00]  A little tyke's choke on stuff.  The New York Public Interest Research Group.  I guess they buy all the toys, test them, and then decide which ones are very dangerous for your child.  Throw them in ten cribs and count how many living babies there are after the day's worth of play.  Yeah, I wonder how they do their experiments.  And the news, man, bunches.  That one's blue.  The news, they're just a bunch of scumbags.  Because I saw this the other day.  Coming up, is the child, is the child, Jesus, I got it now. 
[02:04:30]  Is the toy your child playing with dangerous?  Yeah.  We'll tell you after this.  And there's your little Johnny in the other room playing with all his toys.  And you're wondering if one of those toys is going to kill him.  But you have to wait through the commercial break.  You've got to wait.  Because these scumbags want to, you know, get their ratings up.  I've seen ones that it's not even a commercial break.  It's a teaser for the news that isn't even going to come on until later that night.  And they go, toys could kill your children.  We'll tell you which ones at 11.  Are you driving a dangerous car? 
[02:05:00]  Tune in at 11 o'clock.  For our inside investigation.  A popular food poisoned.  We'll tell you what it is.  What?  I can't eat until...  What?  Very good.  So there's a list of the dangerous toys that we should be watching out for.  How dangerous are these?  Not really that.  I don't know.  I've never heard of any of these things.  Jimmy.  What?  I see you slipping a cheek off the chair.  I actually did not do it. 
[02:05:30]  Did not do it.  I promise you I didn't do it.  Then what the hell is that?  I lifted my cheek, but I was afraid if I eased it out, it was going to be a butterscotch pudding extravaganza.  A tippy-tom on these?  Yeah, especially after one of those nice smoothies.  That's the last thing you knew.  Blast it into my socks.  So I stopped.  Choking hazard toys, not properly labeled.  Fun years, music, big drum, musical set.  Hot wheels, rev up cars.  Oh, you know what toy is really bad this year?  Fist of drunken father when child is talking loud when supposed to be in bed. 
[02:06:00]  That's a really dangerous one.  Careful.  Careful of that one.  Could cause bruising.  Did that happen to you as a kid?  No, it didn't.  But you've got to be careful, too.  The black kids are having a little problem with the toy this year.  is that this toy called Teacher's Mouth makes your penis wet in certain parts of Long Island.  Dangerous toys, Anthony.  Hot wheels, rev up cars.  What's wrong with that one?  I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  They don't tell you what's wrong with them?  Not really.  Just like little pieces?  Yeah, we're talking...  Well, these are the choking toys.  Choking hazards?  There's got to be parts that fall off that the kids could choke on.  But there's other hazards, too, but it's not just choking toys.  Choking hazard.  No, they've got categories.  In South Carolina, they're saying that the minivans are very bad for kids.  Oh, boy.  Especially when put in reverse.  And they still hate your hackling, by the way.  That bed can laugh and have fun.  Fisher-Price Loving Family Pony Parade. 
[02:07:00]  Oh!  You could choke on that.  You could choke on it.  Choke on the...  You could choke on it.  Choke on the pony penis.  Horse gag.  The baby Annabelle with pacifier and rattle.  Ah, the pacifier, I'm sure.  And just like home stove with sounds, I guess, has parts that the kids could choke on.  Mm-hmm.  Strangulation hazards, Anthony.  Oh.  The water yo-yo balls.  Water yo-yo balls?  Wow, we're out of touch.  What the hell is a water yo-yo ball? 
[02:07:30]  I've never heard of that, but you can strangle yourself with it?  Yes, it's...  What happened was the water yo-yo balls is the toy that they sold in Houston, Texas, and  a woman named Andrea Yates, she puts her children and they bob up and down in the tub like yo-yos.  Bubble, bubble, bubble.  Up, down, up, down.  That is hazardous.  Then the bubbles stop.  That is very hazardous.  And another strangulation toy is the bungee ruse, whatever that is. 
[02:08:00]  Bungee ruse.  Does that come with a colorful little cowboy hat and boots?  Boots with little taps on them to do a little dance in Colorado?  That could be a choking hazard.  Oh, by the Garrett, little blonde wispy hair is not included.  Oh, my God. 
[02:08:30]  We are never getting less of this.  Oh, come on.  It happened years ago.  Yeah, please.  You can talk about it now.  I didn't tell her to look that good.  There's a problem now with the new Joel Steinberg play toy set that they say that the handcuffs  are hazardous and radiator not included.  Oh, like the little Katie Beers dream house.  Underground dungeon sold separately. 
[02:09:00]  Or the Eat and Pat's hide-and-go-seek game.  Little Adam-washed bobblehead towel.  All right, I'm going home.  Spring sold separately.  Okay.  Maybe I went too far with that one. 
[02:09:30]  God, that is horrible.  I knew that one was going to be a tragedy.  Oh, good news, though, Anthony.  It was sold separately.  The spring.  The spring.  Torso not included.  Holy shit.  That's awful.  Anthony, this just in. 
[02:10:00]  Booby Man from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  A lot of the children's toys are Steve-resistant, so that's good news.  All right.  There you go.  No, this would be really awful right here.  You know you want to joke about that.  Too soon.  Oh, no.  Too soon.  It only happened two days ago.  Here's a little rule in comedy.  You don't make fun of something before the dental records are back. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, no.  Holy crap.  Awful.  What is this?  That's the yo-yo ball.  Oh, the yo-yo balls.  Yeah, I thought they were dangerous.  Oh, I see these things.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a rubber ball.  My nephew and niece have these. 
[02:11:00]  On the end of a rubber bungee thing that you put on your finger and use like a yo-yo.  These things are actually addicting.  They're kind of cool.  They have soccer balls like this almost.  That you tie around your waist.  Seriously, I'm not even joking.  And you kick them and they teach you how to kick a soccer ball.  Wouldn't it snap back into your nuts?  It's not necessarily a rubber string.  It's more like a regular.  Oh, got you.  All right.  Anthony, there's also excessively loud toys.  Oh.  For the little tots that have their ears that are still developing there. 
[02:11:30]  The Barbie Princess musical CD Boombox.  And the Elite Operations M1 Tank from Jeffrey, Inc.  A little loud.  And then potentially toxic toys.  There's a couple that made that list.  Toxic.  Hello Kitty Star Glitter Nail Polish.  And Sculpey Oven Baked Clay.  Yes, Jimmy?  He's biting his hands so hard. 
[02:12:00]  I know.  He's trying to control himself.  No way.  No way, he says.  Wow.  He's got a line.  He's got a line.  Just, people, just think of some of the things Jimmy has said on this show.  And there's something in his head right now that he deems too offensive to say.  Just think of how horrific that must be.  Well, I think the listeners want in.  They want to help out the parents out there.  Yes, Nick in Michigan.  I think you forgot to mention one of the hazardous toys. 
[02:12:30]  You forgot the Chai Vang Little Outdoorsman kit.  Watch out, guys.  I think that's that hunter.  Yeah.  That was, uh, that they're shooting his fellow hunters.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be bad.  Kevin in Boston, what's up?  Yeah, the Station Nightclub playset comes with Steve Boots.  The what?  The Station Nightclub playset.  It comes with Steve Boots.  And a great white CD with it.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, I guess what we were going to try to do here today was talk about some of the toys  that we grew up with, which were a lot more hazardous.  True.  Hazardous than the toys we just mentioned.  The Robert Reed T-cell yo-yo that doesn't come back up.  Just drops.  The little Matthew Eepin baby shakes a lot. 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  British nanny not included.  Oh.  The Connor Peterson father-son fishing game.  Anchor's away soundtrack sold separately.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Oh.  A little.  Oh.  Oh.  Is this some more old?  Is that...  Is that...  Oh.  I can't.  No, don't do it.  Is this...  What?  Let me say, you ass.  That is horrible.  I cannot say that.  You wrote this down?  No, I don't say it.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, too soon.  Yeah.  Too soon. 
[02:14:30]  You're right.  Oh, phew.  Rule of comedy.  Don't make fun of things until it stops smoldering.  All right.  My first lava lamp cooking set.  Oh.  Jamie's...  Jamie's little lotion bucket.  That's a girl that was in the well. 
[02:15:00]  Isn't her name Jamie?  Silence of the Lambs?  No, it was Karen.  Karen, Freddy.  Jamie was...  James Gum.  Jamie Gum was him.  Yeah.  James Gum.  Oh, then I guess it would work for that, too.  Oh, yeah.  But he was more Buffalo Bill.  Yeah.  But Jamie, that's the guy who actually knows the movie off.  Nice try, Freddy.  Case from Brooklyn.  The Bethany Hamilton surfboard.  Arm not included.  Thank you for that.  Mormon from D.C.  The Christopher Reeve rodeo play set. 
[02:15:30]  I like the Christopher Reeve My Little Pony.  Mikey Biggs from Long Island.  The Shelly Long relationship game.  Pills not included.  That song is so addicting.  The Abu Ghraib Lego people.  You stack them up.  People are horrible. 
[02:16:00]  Let's go to Steve.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  What's up, Steve?  I got one.  Well, actually, I got two.  The first one is the Little Doggy Company's portable radio for children.  Known to cause back strain and herniated discs while moving it from place to place.  Very good.  The other one is the Jeffrey Dahmer kitchen set.  Hands not included.  He likes it.  He just laughs at it.  He's having his own thing.  Tony from Chicago. 
[02:16:30]  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  You left two gifts off the list there.  The first one is the Joel Steinberg Louisville Slugger.  And the second is Susan Smith's child safety seat.  Not bad.  We did both of those references already, but they're not bad.  John from Denver.  John Benet Ramsey, dress up and bondage kit.  Oh.  That is rough.  Mike in Allentown.  Hey, how's it going? 
[02:17:00]  Home of the Bear Man.  Yeah, they're on down here.  The one that you guys left out is a Zigfried and Roy lion tamer kit.  I'd like to know who Zigfried and Roy are.  I know.  It's Zigfried.  I have a Zigfried and Roy.  All right.  So when we were growing up, the toys were a little dangerous, right?  The Noreen Shatner snorkeling kit.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Can't remember any of the toys that we grew up with anymore, but we're talking about lawn  darts.  Very dangerous.  Now, they showed some dangerous stuff.  I think those yo-yo things that you just were talking about, that's like a strangling  hazard.  Sure.  Because it's some rubber, I don't know, it's a rubber stretchy thing on the end of it.  It's like a rubber bungee, and on the end of it is a rubber ball.  So I guess if you wrap it around your neck, you could strangle yourself with it.  But it's nothing these days compared to what they used to sell as toys and not recall as 
[02:18:00]  kids.  These things weren't recalled when we were kids.  They were out there for us to play with and be endangered with on a daily basis.  Lawn darts.  Huge, giant darts.  Well, lawn darts, they weren't dangerous until you started making up your own game.  No, because the game itself is dangerous.  It was played like horseshoes.  You had to throw the darts kind of at each other.  You were at opposite ends of the yard.  Oh, you would stand behind a little circle on the lawn.  Yeah.  Right.  But kind of dangerous. 
[02:18:30]  You know?  But see, we started getting brave and standing in the circle, things like that.  In the circle, throwing them real high in the air so you could barely see where it's  coming down.  Right.  Yeah.  Those are pretty dangerous.  I don't think they make lawn darts anymore.  A lot of kids were impaled by the lawn darts over the years.  Now they make safe lawn darts or something.  It's made out of rubber, the whole thing.  It doesn't have a point on it.  It had a big metal spike that would go like six inches into your skull if it hit you.  The other one, my favorite, click clacks.  Remember those things?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  They were glass balls on the end of strings with a little loop to hold on to.  And what you would do is kind of tick, tick, tick, tick, tick them together, get them going,  and then really start wailing so they'd meet at the top and the bottom.  And they would just sometimes explode, sending shrapnel like you were in the nom.  Like a claymore went off.  Or you would smash the side of your head, too.  Yeah.  If you did them wrong, you could smash yourself in the temple with it. 
[02:19:30]  One I used to love was a super elastic bubble plastic.  Remember super elastic bubble plastic?  Yeah.  You blew like bubbles or something?  Yeah.  You blew these big bubbles.  It came with a tube, this lead tube, like a toothpaste tube, full of this chemical that I'm sure was just the most toxic stuff ever.  And you would put a blob of it on the end of a straw and then blow into the straw.  And it would blow this big balloon thing up made of super elastic bubble plastic. 
[02:20:00]  The problem was when you were blowing into it, it was fine and dandy.  But if you inhaled, like you took a breath to blow more air in, and some of the air that was already in this toxic plastic balloon went back into your lungs,  could be a problem.  You'd start hacking like you had tuberculosis.  And God knows what kind of disease you'd get from it.  Because it was something from DuPont Chemical, I believe, put it out. 
[02:20:30]  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember reading about it.  I wonder why that's not around anymore.  Highly toxic.  But kids would...  What kind of cancer is that causing?  I remember a kid down the block would chew on it like bubble gum.  Holy cow.  He'd chew on it.  Super elastic bubble plastic.  And then there was Incredible Edibles.  What was that again?  Was that...  That was...  They would give you this big monster factory, or a bug factory it was called.  And you would take these metal plates and put this goop, they called it goop, in it. 
[02:21:00]  And then you'd slide it in.  It was almost like a miniature easy bake oven kind of thing.  But it would use metal coils to heat this thing up to a billion degrees or so.  And then they'd give you this metal clamp that you would precariously put in the plate and pull it out.  Now you're holding pretty much a branding iron on a six-inch fork.  And if it would touch, which it would all the time, touch your hands, you'd smell burning flesh and you'd have these angled metal burn marks in your hands. 
[02:21:30]  This was a toy for kids.  It plugged in, it was hot, and then the bubbling little goop that you put in would cool down and you'd have a bug.  It was like this plastic bug.  And when you ran out...  But you could eat it.  And when you ran out of the goop, you started melting your crayons, right?  Crayons, yeah.  And putting those in there.  Because the oven got so hot, it would melt anything.  But you were supposed to eat this stuff, and you never knew what it was.  The goop came in these plastic tubes.  Again, some kind of chemical that solidified after you heated it and let it cool. 
[02:22:00]  And then you'd eat it.  Look, I'm eating a bug.  You had a lot of edible stuff when you were a kid, and you just didn't know what the hell it was.  Chris from Jersey, what's up?  Yo, man, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hello, sweetie, Norton.  Hi, fella.  Welcome to the radio program.  I hear ya.  The worst toy, and they still fucking make it, is that light bright.  You know what I'm talking about?  It was like a white box, and it came with like a billion and one little plastic pegs,  perfect for choking on.  And then you put the little frame over it, like the little plastic, the paper thing, 
[02:22:30]  and you poke the pegs through it, and they light up.  Because this thing lights up with a bulb that gets to be about 9,000 degrees.  And they still make it.  It's still in the stores.  I can't believe they haven't pulled it.  You go to Toys R Us, it's there.  Light bright, making things with light.  Right.  That's the song.  That's the one.  Yeah, you put in these little, and I'm sure those are a choking hazard,  those little pegs, and you'd put them in the various colors, and it would,  yeah, it's a little dangerous.  David from Jersey.  What's up, David?  A lot of calls from Jersey today. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, David.  How you doing?  You stuck?  Thanks.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  I got two.  I got two for you guys.  It's NYU Base Jumping Kids.  Not bad.  And the Shandra Levy Hide and Seek and Seek and Seek and Seek.  I thought you were just stuttering.  Very good.  Nice.  That's good.  All right.  You rock, man.  Thanks, fella.  All right.  Charlie from Newark.  What's up, Charlie? 
[02:23:30]  What's up, Owen?  Hey, God.  What's going on?  You forgot a game.  Huh?  The Christy Alley Hungry Hippo Game.  Hungry, hungry, Kirstie.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Greg from Kansas.  You hit her on the back and her fat mouth opens and grabs something and pulls it back in.  You punch the small of her fat spine.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, they still sell that plastic bubble stuff down here.  They've got a safety mechanism on the straw where it only blows one way where you can't inhale it. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, you can't inhale it anymore?  They put a little one-way check valve in the straw here.  Great.  Of course they still sell it in Kansas.  No, it's in Texas.  What?  Texas, I think.  Oh, Texas?  Oh, I said Kansas on the line.  Oh, I said.  All right.  And don't stop you from getting a jack-in-a-box drum on your brains out that way.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Dan from Jersey.  I got another toy for you.  Yeah.  Michael J. Fox bobblehead. 
[02:24:30]  Nice.  Horrible.  And cut.  Michael J. Fox should be a fine Etch-A-Sketch.  Although not when making the picture, but like, I'm finished with this.  Hold this for a second.  Shaka, shaka, shaka.  What are you doing?  I was just showing it to you.  Shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka.  Shaka.  Try to show him your Etch-A-Sketch and he just ruins it.  Shrinky dinks.  That's right.  Remember the Shrinky dinks?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  You'd take these little things, you'd cut them out of plastic and put them in your oven.  You'd color them in, put them in the oven on a cookie sheet and bake them and they would  shrink and turn into glass.  But sometimes they would explode and you'd get this Shrinky dink explosion, which would  leave little glass shards inside your oven.  Cause fires.  Remember Digger the dog?  Dig and he goes with you when you explore.  Just pull his leash.  He's your dog for sure.  It was this awful plastic dog. 
[02:25:30]  You'd just walk it and it would just go, ow, ow, ow, ow, and it just sucked.  I guess it sold.  You got the worst toys growing up.  I didn't get that.  It was just a little puppy you could pet.  Megan Kanker sold separately.  That is really awful.  Jim from Center Reach.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How about the Rock'em Sock'em Master Poe bots?  You guys suck. 
[02:26:00]  We're moving on from the Master Poe thing.  Please do me a favor and move on from that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  I used to get beat with the Hot Wheel Track.  Hot Wheel Track, yeah.  Yeah, that was the other thing growing up.  The parents would use our own toys to beat us up.  How degrading is that?  I definitely got some spankings with the Hot Wheel Track.  Hot Wheel Track.  That orange length, that three foot length track.  Upper legs, wham.  They could leave two different welts.  The bottom welt, which would give you the little notch that you used to put the little tongue 
[02:26:30]  into the notch you'd put the tongue in.  to stick the tracks together.  Or they'd turn it upside down where you'd get the two thin rails from the top of the  track, which would leave two really nice welts, look like cuts.  I liked color forms when I was a boy.  Another dangerous choking hazard.  I would smell them, though.  The plastic always smelled good when you first opened them.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  You'd peel back the color form.  The smell of a brand new set of color forms. 
[02:27:00]  Fantastic.  That was very nice.  When you smell new books, right, you've got to smell a new book, especially with shiny pages.  I'll smell one.  I always hate when my face leaves grease on the page.  But do you ever only smell the page once?  I can't smell it more than once, or I feel like the smell is gone.  It is.  Right?  Like the little dittos you'd get in school.  When they'd take one and hand it back, hand the pile back, and you'd smell it.  Yeah.  But then, alas, it was gone in a second.  Yep.  Once you smelled it.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Dittos.  I used to smell it.  We so need to take a break.  Why would you...  Who's on the hotline?  Someone's calling in.  Oh, the Mabel King jump rope.  Or you could pick up the Rich Voss speak and spell.  That's hilarious.  Mabel King jump rope.  That's a good one. 
[02:28:00]  Who's on the hotline, Oak?  I don't know.  I'm still waiting.  Who?  Big Kev.  Hey, Big Kev.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  You guys didn't talk about BB guns or disc guns or...  Yeah, those were toys as a kid.  They would give you BB guns.  You can't get a BB gun anymore.  Well, you can't just go in and buy one.  You know, like a kid can't go in and buy one.  You have to have an adult with you.  Exactly.  But as a kid, you used to be able to just go in, buy a BB gun, go in into the woods, kill everything. 
[02:28:30]  Every little common pop store.  Shoot your friends.  How old were you when you got your first gun, Anthony?  First gun?  Uh, 12?  12 or 13.  Yeah.  Pistol.  Got a .22 pistol.  They once bought me a rubber band gun.  Ooh.  I know.  That's badass.  They had different childhoods, I'll tell you.  I said, give me the gat.  Let me show you where it's at.  I was only allowed to shoot it in the backyard by myself. 
[02:29:00]  Hmm.  That was a lot of fun.  Shoot it in the backyard by yourself and it was a rubber band gun?  It was a rubber band, like, rifle.  So, you know, you stretch the rubber bands, you know, far enough back.  And you were told to, hey, now be careful with this.  Oh, yeah.  The rubber bands were talking.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oof.  And then there was a mechanism where the rubber bands would stretch even more after you got  it loaded.  So they would go pretty far.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Wow, that sounds quite dangerous.  I never heard of something that could work as a weapon and also help ponytails stay in 
[02:29:30]  place.  All right, Kev.  Thank you.  See you.  Bye.  The Reginald Denny piÃ±ata set.  Wow.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, so what's up with the Lacey Peterson song?  So what's the deal?  I'm serious.  Is this a real Lacey Peterson song?  Yeah, no parody.  I just want to see what kind of drivel. 
[02:30:00]  Who is this person?  His name is Tony Handy.  He's 50, which means he's a failed songwriter.  Right.  A failed performer.  Everyone has been moved by the events as they unfold, said Tony Handy.  As the story went on, I wanted to get more involved.  Great.  Of course you did.  He wants to capitalize.  This is like the guys, the fans, right after 9-11.  Oh, my God.  Almost as tragic as the event itself were the songs that came out after 9-11. 
[02:30:30]  Every band, every bad singer decided that they were going to pull the country together in  song after 9-11 and really put forth a song that could capture the emotions and what we  were feeling.  Ugh.  All of them sucked.  We actually played a bunch of them on the air and tried to figure out what cornball lines  they were going to try to rhyme with another.  You just hit the nail on the head because there was two guys that actually wrote songs. 
[02:31:00]  And it also says, both men previously wrote musical tributes about other tragic events.  Strand, a guard at dual vocational institution at Tracy, composed Song for America, a patriotic  folk song, four days after September 11th.  Four days.  Ugh.  They just want to be involved and they want people to look for them as passionate artists.  Yeah.  And you're all over 40 and you failed performers.  Failed.  Miserably.  Failed.  Those songs, they were rhyming like, I don't know, shame and plane. 
[02:31:30]  Tower and power.  Tower.  But we have the power.  Oh, and we were just sickened.  Yeah.  Ugh.  These guys just trying to get some kind of recognition with a song about a tragedy.  So this guy decides he's going to append a Lacey Peterson song.  I bet it's just sappy.  Oh, yeah.  And drippy.  Well, let's take a listen.  Let's give a little.  I just want to see what he uses to word with the rhyme, mouthy. 
[02:32:00]  She was lippy.  And as a result, her and Connor got drippy.  Ah.  Ah, starts off nice.  Nice.  Shit dick.  The lounge version.  Remembering Lacey, how her smile would make you smile.  Remembering Lacey.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Our smile.  What?  Our smile would make you smile. 
[02:32:30]  Her smile wouldn't make anyone smile.  Would make you smile.  Is that what he rhymed?  Apparently her...  Oh, I didn't catch the same word.  You're right.  I think it is.  Well, we're going to have to play that.  One of Tim's part again, I think.  And then we can see what he rhymes it with.  I think I heard denial.  Oh.  Remembering Lacey, how her smile would make you smile.  Ugh.  Remembering Lacey, how she loved there's no denial. 
[02:33:00]  Now the angels hold her gently.  And little Connor's with her too.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And little Connor.  He put a little Connor in.  The only thing...  The only reason he should be saying denial  is if that's the river she's at the bottom of.  Oh, God, no.  Ding, ding, ding.  It sucks.  It does suck. 
[02:33:30]  No denial.  Let's hear the rest of it.  Remembering Lacey and the way that fat stomach would annoy you when you're going to fuck Amber.  Oh, Jesus, guys.  He put little Connor in.  I know.  And she smiles and says, we're all right.  And we send our love to you.  Get your lighters out, everyone.  What rhymes with Connor besides he's a little goner?  Life and happiness was pretty Lacey's life.  With little Connor on the way, just made things seem so right. 
[02:34:00]  Still the two of them together, from the start to heaven's door.  And she smiles and says, we love you, to the one she's loved before.  The tears that fell made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  And little Connor runs and picks them. 
[02:34:30]  Even though he's blue.  Mama, this is for you.  Oh, this is our little Connor ring.  Put on a little Connor voice.  Can we hear the little Connor voice again?  Mom, these are for you.  These are for you.  Oh, thank you, fetus.  What is that cord coming out of your stomach?  A little bouquet of seaweed he gives her.  You guys are insane.  I am convinced you guys are insane with this. 
[02:35:00]  A bouquet of seaweed.  This is dribble.  Mom.  Hell made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  Ugh.  And little Connor runs and picks them.  Mama, this is for you.  Ugh.  Mama.  Now the angels are insane.  Why do you talk like Rod from What's Happening?  Little wigger.  Such attributes from afar.  Yo, moms.  These are for you.  As you gaze into the heavens, look. 
[02:35:30]  The Lacey Connor star.  Ugh.  How about the Lacey Connor bully?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  How she loved her study now.  Now the angels hold her gently.  And little Connor's with her, too.  Turn it off.  And she smiles and says, we're all right. 
[02:36:00]  And we send our love to you.  Bye.  And we send our love to you.  Yeah.  That is awful.  Wow.  That is horrific.  Can we get one of these guys on the phone for Monday?  Is that possible?  Oh, yeah.  Can we play the song?  I think we should interview one of these guys. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  We want to see what he's all about.  Can we do that?  He's all about.  That's the only one?  Oh, God.  That isn't on the song.  Great ending.  Oh, that's brutal.  Oh, that is hilarious.  A little bouquet of sea.  One body enter.  Two bodies leave.  Oh, is that horrible.  Oh, yuck. 
[02:37:00]  Mama, these are for you.  That is everything that's wrong with music.  Rod Stewart shit dick.  And Aids and Scott will kill you.  That would be awful.  Thanks.  Wow.  We got the lady, the lady, the Lacey Peterson verdict.  Oh.  The Lacey Peterson verdict? 
[02:37:30]  The Lacey Peterson verdict?  What is she accused of besides being mouthy, which she's been convicted of?  Her verdict is, yeah, you're right.  A sentence has been carried out.  By the way, that thing you were looking at on your computer was just hilarious and revolting  at the same time.  Some mutant decided to make a wedding invitation.  Is this on one of our websites?  I don't know.  God, what creeps we attract.  The Ramses and the Petersons cordially invite you to the wedding of Lil' Conor and JonBenet. 
[02:38:00]  Adam Walsh, parentheses, with or without his head, will be honorary ring bearer.  And it is a photoshopped picture that is disgusting.  It's got JonBenet's head on a bride's body.  Some type of, only looks to be a submerged baby head on the groom's body.  And then there's the Petersons and the Ramseys. 
[02:38:30]  And what's the best part?  Is look in the guy's left hand.  Yes, in Conor's left hand is what appears to be Adam Walsh's head.  And the one woman has her arm around the boy's chest and he's headless.  Yes.  That could be the most repugnant yet enjoyable thing I've ever seen.  I mean, he obviously put a little work into it.  Research, some photoshopper skills.  A little work.  He slapped that together in five minutes.  You should have nightmares, you disgusting man. 
[02:39:00]  That was rough.  Nightmares, I hope you have nightmares.  Wendy, what's up?  Hi, I have song intro ideas.  Song intro ideas for Noah and Eric?  Yes.  Okay.  Noah, definitely sex machine, James Brown.  All right.  And for Eric, of course, Jungle Love, Moor's Day of the Time.  Oh, Moor's Day, yeah.  Oh, okay.  We might have to.  Yeah, I know that song.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll have to try that out and get that work.  Excellent.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Bye.  I meant to say that we had Lacey Peterson's song, and then I said Lacey Peterson's verdict  because we want to play the Scott Peterson verdict.  Scott Peterson.  Well, and I got it all messed up.  Were you there in front of the TV when they had the announcement?  I heard it was going to be 4.30, so I went inside, turned it on,  and had to listen to CNN and Fox News babble for about 15 minutes before they actually had the verdict.  They have nothing to talk about.  Fox News just talking about how will it be better for him to get the death penalty or life in prison without parole. 
[02:40:00]  Now, you would think this isn't even an argument, but these two guys are going at each other like,  No, it would be much better for him to get the death penalty because California has like 600 people on death row,  and they execute an average of one a year.  So do the math.  It's going to take a little while to get to old Scotty Peterson.  I don't think they'll ever kill him.  They won't.  California is very, you know, very lax.  They have the death penalty, but like New York, just don't use it.  Well, they said in the paper today the death penalty is way down across America. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  They're barely using it these days.  It's because, you know, they appeal it.  The lawyers get in there.  Right.  The red tape.  A lot of red tape.  So he's looking at about...  Like, we have the death penalty here in New York.  Oh, we don't use it.  We've never used it.  No.  How long has it been in the...  It's been a while.  But you know what it is?  It's different because we have prosecutors that won't even try to get it.  Robert Johnson in the Bronx?  Yeah.  They won't even try.  Like, at least in California, they're like, yeah, get this guy the death penalty.  They give it to him, but then it takes forever.  That's how they satisfy some of the voters.  You know, they want the death penalty, but they give the voters the death penalty. 
[02:41:00]  But then they don't tell you, well, we're never going to use it.  We're never going to use it.  But we have it.  Yeah.  How long have we had the death penalty in New York?  Someone could help us out on the instant feedback.  Ten years?  I guess since Pataki got in.  So how long is that?  Eight, ten years?  I don't know.  Cuomo was a staunch anti-death penalty faggot.  The whole death penalty thing is a joke at this point.  Oh, I know.  So if you have it, use it.  What they were saying with Scott Peterson is he could be in there a good 20 years before he even got the death penalty, if ever. 
[02:41:30]  And during that time, if you're on death row, you're in solitary confinement.  You're not in the general population.  You spend all the hours in your cell.  You get a little time out that's supervised.  And that's it.  The only contact you have is through yelling back and forth to other death row inmates.  So he's safer on death row.  How do you live your life like that?  It's something you should think about before you dump your wife into the drink.  I don't mind if they scrap the death penalty and just give people life in prison without parole. 
[02:42:00]  I'm kind of cool with that.  I don't know because it never, ever seems like life in prison without parole.  Something always happens.  And years and years later, they're old guys.  And, you know, they decide, oh, you could let them out.  You know, life in prison without parole doesn't mean that somehow you can get off.  You know, the governor or the president can pardon you.  Things happen.  And these people should just be wiped off the face of the earth.  I agree with you.  I don't disagree.  I don't think it's cruel and unusual like the ACLU said. 
[02:42:30]  I don't have enough faith in the fact that nobody innocent will ever get it.  That's my only problem.  It's not a cruel and unusual issue for me.  I don't know.  If you have money, you can, like, O.J., we all know it was a racial thing, but he had  the money to afford.  If you had the money to afford certain type of experts and certain type, do you understand  if everybody was getting the exact same defense, I wouldn't have so much of a problem with it?  I don't know.  All the death penalty cases I've ever read about, it certainly seems like they're guilty.  But then again, you have these guys.  Most of them, I think, are.  But then you have these guys that go after people that are not, like, legally innocent. 
[02:43:00]  Like, people not technicality innocent, but people that actually didn't commit the crime.  And they're fighting to get them off death row.  And they say that a lot of times the courts don't even have to hear the cases because  the evidence came in late or some bullshit like that.  That's what bugs me.  Yeah, those little technical glitches.  Yeah, where you're actually innocent and it can be proven, but some DA doesn't want  egg on his face, so they fight to keep the evidence out.  That's what kind of bothers me.  I've never seen that on a death penalty case, though.  Yeah, there's plenty of them.  I've seen it in cases where the guy's been sitting rotting in prison, and perhaps he didn't  do that crime. 
[02:43:30]  I've never seen him go out and go, well, thank God, this professor's back teaching again.  Very rare, yeah.  It's always, you know, sharpen up your screwdriver for another victim on the subway, you animal.  All right, so the verdict.  Bernie Getz.  Dude, we've got to get him in here.  I love Bernard Getz.  We're trying to get him in here.  We love to have him on the show.  I don't know.  Maybe that one will happen.  Tom Cruise didn't happen yesterday, but maybe we'll get Bernie.  I'd rather have Bernie Getz.  Oh, true.  A Tom Cruise interview would have been a waste of time.  No, it would have been a lot of fun, but I feel like Tom Cruise.  Just so we could say, hey, we had Tom Cruise on our show? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  What kind of radio is he really going to give you in the end?  Not like Tom Cruise stood over an animal, pointed his gun, and said, you don't look so  bad.  He shot him again.  And that Ron Colby should also slip in a puddle of age and crack his teeth on a urinal for  defending that scumbag, Daryl KB, and going after him in the civil court.  He's the, you know, defend the obviously guilty guy.  Ugh.  Yeah, maybe someday.  New York death penalty, nine years since 1995.  So the verdict came in yesterday, and now all the jurors are getting their mugs all over 
[02:44:30]  TV today.  Jurors are the worst.  That redheaded chick.  That pussy.  She got her hair did.  I got my hair did.  She's on all the morning shows, and now it looks like it's some kind of reddish perm now.  It is raggedy and red, and she's wearing, like, too much blush, and she loves that camera.  These jurors, they sit on these cases, these high-profile cases.  They get this feeling of self-importance because they have some guy's life in their hands, a 
[02:45:00]  lot of media coverage.  Whether they see it or not, they know it's being covered.  And then when they get let out, and the press is clamoring to talk to them, all of a sudden  they're stars.  They're stars.  Remember all the jurors from the sniper case?  Oh, remember?  Remember, stupid redheaded bitch?  Because that's what's going to be you.  You'll be a star.  You'll fade away again.  Or the OJ juror that had her own HBO special?  Oh.  Remember that black girl?  Yeah.  She had her own HBO special?  Dude, she's everything the black community hates, and justifiably so. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Because she talks like that.  She's a black girl who talks like that.  Yeah.  And she had her own HBO special where she sat there and did, like, a one-man Spalding Gray type  of show without the old...  I wish she'd do Spalding Gray's last act.  Kill yourself.  A swan dive.  Kill yourself.  From the furry.  And she gave this melodramatic drivel one-person show about the case.  It was revolting.  They all get put in the position now where they're celebrities.  They're chasing this redhead around now. 
[02:46:00]  One of them's always the standout.  During the sniper case, it was that black guy with the Aaron Neville stuff all over his  head.  And he was the one.  And then they find out that, like, he had all kinds of problems with the law.  These people ought to shut their yabs if they're, you know, they just slink away somewhere.  And now it's the redhead.  They're chasing her around like crazy.  And that other guy, too, with the short hair.  Yeah.  That was sitting right next to her.  Yeah, this guy.  He's on TV right now.  On Fox News.  Cardosi.  Steve Carlesi?  What? 
[02:46:30]  Well, we thought he was guilty because...  Our own Steve was a juror?  The juror with the flaming tie.  So here's the verdict as it was read yesterday.  People of the state of California versus Scott Peterson.  We, the jury, and the above-entitled cause fixed the penalty at death.  Dated December 13, 2014.  For person number six.  Good.  Number six, is that the unanimous verdict of the jury with respect to the penalty phase?  It is, Your Honor. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Mr. Garrett, would you like to do your call?  Yes.  All right.  Would you call the jury?  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please answer yes or no as I call your juror number as  seated and ask the following question.  Was the verdict as just read your true and individual verdict?  Juror number one?  Good morning.  Juror number two?  Dillon!  Juror number three?  I would like to just get to know you.  Juror number four.  Hello, cutie pie.  Juror number five.  How are you?  Juror number six.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Juror number seven. 
[02:47:30]  It's time now.  Juror number eight.  Juror number eight.  Juror number nine.  There is no button.  Juror number ten.  It's not a two.  Juror number eleven.  I thought we were going to do so.  Now we're having fun.  Your honor, the jury has to be pulled.  Almost pulled it off.  He almost pulled it off.  And some of them were a little long.  I'd like to help you a little if you gave me some eye contact, dude.  I was afraid to slow down for you.  You son of a bitch.  I was afraid to slow down for you.  You went nuts.  Quiet.  I know.  I'm pressing buttons like a madman. 
[02:48:00]  You almost had.  That was funny.  You started sweating.  You were like loosing the chocolate factor.  You couldn't keep up anymore, man.  There's that fat creep on TV now.  Oh, there she is.  And she's wearing a pink, pink clothing.  She's doing costume changes.  She wasn't wearing that earlier.  No, that's yesterday's footage because now she's got her hair permed.  Is it permed now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She got her hair did.  She's pretty sexy. 
[02:48:30]  Would you get me Mr. Peterson's daytime number?  I don't think he's available for phone calls.  Well, you know, it's Mr. Peterson.  Mr. Peterson?  Boy, is he in trouble.  I love that one.  Well, I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake.  My favorite right here.  A family member dies, and you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole. 
[02:49:00]  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Hey, the lawyer did a great job for Scotty Boy, huh?  Oh, all those lawyers.  Scumbag.  And then they do that, put the arm around the guy in the courtroom, like that's going to help at all.  He's like, we're going to appeal.  That guy is going to run.  I forgot his name.  Mark Garagos.  Yeah, Garagos.  He's going to run for the hills.  Oh, yeah.  He's done with that case.  Say goodbye to the wife killer, and now you can move on to the thin-nosed pedophile, you fucking vulture. 
[02:49:30]  He's not even fired.  He's not on that case.  He's just a cock.  He's just a cock.  How do you fuck your wife?  How do you look your wife in the face, knowing you really went to bat for a guy who choked his wife while she was pregnant?  Or some guy that fingers eight-year-olds when they come to his ranch?  Yeah.  Fucking vulture.  Hate fucking lawyers, man.  Everyone deserves fair representation in the court of law, Jim.  You know, if some lawyers want to exclusively do that for the cash and for the spotlight, that's their business. 
[02:50:00]  I didn't do anything.  My fingerprints just happened to be on the same pornographic magazine as this other boy.  Fucking thin-nosed racial sellout.  God, do I hope he goes to prison and kills himself.  You will see people that will back Michael Jackson to their grave.  Good.  And think that he is completely innocent.  Well, there are people out there that will back anyone.  O.J. 
[02:50:30]  Remember all the O.J. people, backers?  Were they really backing O.J., though?  Were they just doing it going, look, I know he's guilty, but...  Just say it.  Do you remember black people?  Yes.  Black people.  That cheered when O.J. was found not guilty?  It was Cochran they were cheering.  They weren't cheering O.J.  They know he did it.  It was more like, this is what black people did.  This is how it feels.  Now do you see the system is fucked up?  Now do you see...  That's what that vibe was about.  They knew he did it.  And then Michael Jackson.  I got my own mother.  My own mother. 
[02:51:00]  I'm disgusted with her when we talk about Michael Jackson.  I don't think he did it.  Really?  Like, what do you base that on?  That you like his songs?  You know, what do you base that on?  The guy is...  There's so much evidence.  There's so much past that he's had  that you've got to assume that he's done all this stuff.  Why are you having kids over your house?  Why are your fingerprints on porno magazines  that your little kids' fingerprints are on? 
[02:51:30]  Why are you paying their parents millions of dollars  with written contracts for them to shut up?  So what does your mom...  Your mama.  Mama.  So what does your mom think happen?  Mama.  Like, what's her take on this whole thing?  Her take is that he is just a poor guy  who never had a childhood  that enjoys the company of children.  Is that a little weird?  Sure.  But is it a crime?  Is he molesting these children?  What about the alarms in his bedroom that...  Latoya said. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, that tell him that people are coming.  Toward his bedroom.  He's got a Cheez-It alarm, really?  That's what...  Right?  Latoya said that he's got sensor alarms  walking up to his bedroom  so he'll know when people are coming.  Maybe the parents should have put alarms  up the kids' butts.  Michael Jackson finger detectors.  Skinny little pale vitiligo finger goes in there.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.  Remove your finger from the child.  Remove your finger from the child. 
[02:52:30]  This butt is protected from Michael Jackson.  His finger's not white anymore.  No.  That's right.  I just wanted to get my skin color back.  Oh, Jesus.  I had some vitiligo on my index finger  and it was looking like it was too white for my hand.  So I thought a young boy might be able  to brown it up.  Thought I could get some cinnamon color to it. 
[02:53:00]  Cinnamon lips.  God, do I hope he goes to prison.  I really hope he kills himself.  And your mom's just defending him  because she's just a fellow singer.  Oh, yeah, that must have been it.  The singers all come to each other's aid.  Hi, Michael.  I'm thinking, you know,  I know you want to get off the children.  Perhaps you could just go downstairs  and get on the treadmill or something.  You know, I know that Dr. Phil said  if you give something up,  you should replace it with something.  So, you know, I don't know,  give up your index finger  and use your middle finger. 
[02:53:30]  You've got to wean yourself off.  Perhaps once you get through all the piggies,  you won't want to jam it up  a small child's butt anymore.  And, you know,  it's Anthony's mom here  and I know, you know,  I just love you.  I love your music.  It's really nice.  And, you know,  just try to stay away from the kids.  I love you.  Don't...  Not on your goddamn radio.  Dance mom singing, everybody. 
[02:54:00]  Dance mom.  I promise.  That moves.  Waitin' for a tween.  And I'm feelin'  nearly stated as my jeans.  That goes mommy.  Bobby thumbed Diesel down  just before it rains.  He rode us all the way  to New Orleans.  Go.  Do it, Bob.  Go.  I pulled my harpoon  and my dirty red bandana. 
[02:54:30]  Come on.  I'm singin' song.  Come on.  I'm singin' song.  I'm singin' song.  I'm balled Bobby's  sang blue.  Yeah.  Windshield whoppers slurpin' time.  I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine.  Mommy.  I'm singin' every song  that drive anew.  Freedom's just another word  for nothin' left to lose.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[02:55:00]  Shut up!  Nothing.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  We're up!  Feelin' was good enough, Lord,  when he sang the blues.  You know, feelin' good  was good enough for me.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Quiet.  Good enough for me.  Am I bumping in the game?  Stop it!  Stop it!  You lack discipline.  Shut up!  Quiet. 
[02:55:30]  From Kentucky coal mines  to the California sun.  Shut up!  Hey, Bobby,  share the secrets of my soul.  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  Through all kinds of weather,  do everything that we've done.  Shut up!  Hey, Bobby,  baby,  get me from the cold.  Yeah!  One day up near Selena,  Lord,  let him slip away.  He's lookin' for that home, 
[02:56:00]  and I hope he finds it.  Turn it off.  But I'd trade all up  tomorrow,  for a single yesterday,  to be holdin' Bobby's body  next to mine.  Freedom's just another word  for nothin' let you lose.  Nothing that's all...  Shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  Feelin' good was good enough 
[02:56:30]  for the women's  ain't the blues.  Shut up!  Feelin' good was good  enough for me.  Oh, good enough for me  and my Bobby McGee.  Follow that.  La, la, la, la, la, la,  gra-la-la,  la-la-la-la,  la-la-la,  Bobby and McGee.  Dabby and McGee!  Dabby and McGee!  Dabby and McGee!  Dabby and McGee! 
[02:57:00]  La-la-la.  La-la.  Bobby McGee.  La-la-la-la.  OkÃ©, terrific.  La-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la.  Bobby McGee.  Okay, terrific.  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  Okay, terrific.  Bobby McGee.  ZANG EN MUZIEK 
[02:57:30]  ZANG EN MUZIEK 
[02:58:00]  I don't know what to say. 
[02:58:30]  That's my life at every party.  Never gets old.  Jesus.  That's my life at every party.  Oh, my father needed a motorboat and a cinder block.  Dad, what are you doing?  Nothing, Ant.  Back to the dock. 
[02:59:00]  Dad, I thought we came out here to go fishing.  No, Ant.  Just give me a hand with this.  It's a little garbage from the house.  There you go.  Whoa, why are we going home so fast?  Oh, my God. 
[02:59:30]  Dave in New York.  Janis Joplin could do a better job now.  Dave, what's up?  I love it.  Janis Joplin would have told my mother, hey, I think you had too much to drink.  Dave?  Yeah, guys, that was great.  That was fantastic.  It's something you've got to be there.  You've got to actually be there to see the visual on that.  Oh, yeah? 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Were you?  What's that?  Were you a guest at a party?  No, I would have loved to see that, though.  Oh, yeah.  I would have loved to see that old Bobby McGee thing.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  You ought to take it on the road.  All right, let's go to Al in Cleveland.  Hey, Al, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  I just wanted to say real quick, I don't understand why Jimmy's so pissed at Jackson.  You know, he's just trying to play with kids, and kids that play together, you know,  they don't molest each other.  Right, Jimmy?  Well, that's a good point, sir. 
[03:00:30]  I had experience when I was a youngster, and I was a dirty boy, so if I was still into  that as an adult, I'd be even a filthier boy.  Right, but you were just a kid.  Any adult that hangs out with kids like that, you're not Peter Pan.  You're a scumbag and a predator and a pedophile, and I hope you go to jail and kill yourself.  Wow.  Nice.  Mike from Washington.  Yeah, just wanted to say, hey, what's up, you guys, and tell you a good joke real quick.  What Michael Jackson and Kmart have in common?  Oh, no.  I think I have boys' pants half off? 
[03:01:00]  Yep.  They both have little boys' pants half off.  Hey, you guys, have a good holiday.  All right, we got the Lacey Peterson song.  Oh, God.  This is horrific.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's such a fitting little tune.  Is it lighthearted?  Well, it's very lighthearted.  I think you're going to think it's lighthearted, sure.  Now, I've got to say something first.  This is really, really horrific.  We got a song in, I think yesterday, and me and Opie listened to it before the show started, 
[03:01:30]  and we were like, no.  What song?  Now we have to play it, because now we've brought it to the attention of everybody.  But it was a Lacey Peterson song, but it was just, like, brutal and really nothing creative or...  Was it the chemistry one?  Was it the rap one?  Yeah.  Just really bad.  Yeah, there's no reason to use the C word.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Unless it's S-E-A. 
[03:02:00]  You're a quick motherfucker.  Damn, is that funny?  R, the C.  Yeah, there's no reason for that.  I mean, it's tragic, it's dark, but you've got to keep it lighthearted, don't you?  Believe it or not, there is a method to this.  And there is a line.  Should we play the brutal one that we got in today?  Oh.  Who did this, by the way? 
[03:02:30]  We don't know?  They got today or yesterday?  It came in today.  And then maybe we'll play the one we played from last week.  The serious one.  Oh, right, good.  Yeah, yeah, we've got to play the serious one again.  Yeah.  So we'll...  What?  Oh, the serious one is so bad.  It's just terrible.  Mommy, these for you.  Remember?  Mama?  Mama.  Mama, these for you.  This is today's song?  Yeah.  Okay.  You said a handful of seaweed. 
[03:03:00]  A little bouquet of seaweed.  Mama.  Brr.  Why are you talking like Count Chocula?  Brr.  Mandy, let's shoot this fucker.  Nobody gives two fucks for Connor.  I like to wear plastic bags over my head.  Connor or Glenda. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, Plan 9 from Modesto.  All right, Scott, now get in the rowboat.  Cut.  Perfect.  Print it.  A man his size would have trouble drowning his wife and getting away.  This is the murder they'll remember me for.  I like to wear plastic bags over my head. 
[03:04:00]  Fuck.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, the new one.  Yeah, the new Lacey Peterson song was done by Ass Suck.  Ass Suck?  This is from the Ass Suck?  The one and only Ass Suck from Wackbag.com.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, hit it.  This is brutal.  Are y'all ready, kid?  Hi, I can't dare you. 
[03:04:30]  Hi, I can't dare you.  Oh.  Who lives in a body bag under the sea.  Lacey Peterson.  Absorbent and bloated and pregnant was she.  Lacey Peterson.  Where nauseating, nagging Scott will miss it.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Her and Connor are food for the fish.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson. 
[03:05:00]  From the collection.  Yeah.  What a great motor board.  That's a great sound clip at the end.  That is a good motor boat.  Steal that one.  It's a lot bigger than the motor boat I have.  Great splash.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  You knew it, Ben, when it started off with seagulls and ocean noises.  Yeah.  Will Spongebob Squarepants theme song. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, is that what that was?  Yeah, yeah.  That's from Spongebob.  That's funny.  Thank you, ass suck.  Ass suck.  Okay, horrific.  Okay, horrific.  Some of the reviews, early reviews are in.  Oh, yeah.  That was sympathetic.  No, we're playing the sympathetic one next.  That was a good parody, though.  I mean, it wasn't dirty.  It was just, it was funny.  It was quick.  You could understand the words.  Absolutely.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  I'm actually working on a song parody called We Sink Right Past the Yellow Submarine.  I'm so glad.  Face is blue and feet are green.  We passed the yellow submarine when I was born.  In Modesto, sea, and he told the truth of his life, in the last of the day, so we saved 
[03:06:30]  up to the sun, until we find the feet of green.  Yeah.  The feet of green.  Well.  I wasn't going to follow.  There's no way I was going to follow feet of green.  I just couldn't.  No.  I'm so glad the verdict is in.  Thank God.  We will.  We're going to move on now, right?  Of course we're going to move on. 
[03:07:00]  Absolutely.  There'll be another horrible case.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are y'all doing?  Good.  Hi.  I'm just glad that I'll have company in hell, because I'm definitely going after laughing  at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a rough one.  That was horrible.  Yeah.  We'll read all the hate mail tomorrow on the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right.  You guys are great.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Let's go to Josh in Utah.  What's up, Josh?  Oh, my God, guys.  That was the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.  I almost fucking crashed. 
[03:07:30]  That was my $2 worth for the next three years.  Punch it out.  There he goes.  All right.  Well, now let's play this beautiful song.  This one is a tribute to Lacey Peterson.  Done by what's his name?  Got a name on that?  Amnesty?  No.  Face fuck.  This one was written seriously.  John Strand.  Oh, there you go.  And this guy's even worse. 
[03:08:00]  He's awful.  Yeah.  Because he already wrote a 9-11 song after that happened.  And now he's just trying to capitalize on tragedy.  And he wrote this song as a serious tribute to her.  He's got a horrible voice.  And this song stinks.  It's full of cliches and trying to tug at your heartstrings.  But it's so corny.  Drippy, phony, altruism.  Yeah.  I'd say he's one notch above us as far as being a scumbag in this situation. 
[03:08:30]  No, he's below us.  You put him below us?  By eight notches.  Because our motives look we're dicks and we're being dicks and we're goofing on something.  But there's no hidden agenda in here.  We're not trying to make ourselves deep by latching onto a tragedy.  He's really trying to elevate himself and attach himself and somehow be like the voice of reason.  And he's a scumbag.  Dishonest motives.  It's haunting, though.  It's beautiful.  Elton John. 
[03:09:00]  Woodblock.  Remembering Lacey, how her smile would make you smile.  Good rhyming scheme, douche.  Remembering Lacey, how she loved there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently.  And little Connor's with her, too.  And she smiles and says, we're all right. 
[03:09:30]  And we send our love to you.  As the fishes start to chew.  So full of life and happiness was pretty Lacey's life.  What?  Her life was full of life.  What a dick.  Just made things seem so right.  Too bad she was a shitty life.  Well, she says a lot with duct tape on her mouth, doesn't she? 
[03:10:00]  Here's that bell-made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  Here comes.  And little Connor runs and picks them.  Mama, these for you.  What a horse shit.  Yuck. 
[03:10:30]  The only thing he's handing her is placenta.  Look, the Lacey Connor star.  Lacey Connor star.  Remembering Lacey, how her smile would make you smile.  On your smile, remembering Lacey, how she loved, there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently. 
[03:11:00]  And little Connor's with her, too.  And she smiles and says, we're all right.  And we send our love to you.  It's a bitch's out of gitches.  Yeah.  It's a bitch's out of gitches.  It certainly is.  And what she really smiles and says is, 
[03:11:30]  Smile makes you smile.  What an awful voice.  Remembering Lacey.  Lacey, la, yearn, yearn, yearn.  The Lacey, star.  Mama, these for you.  He didn't say anything.  It was a fetus.  Stop presenting him like he was little Connor the child. 
[03:12:00]  I understand.  It's tragic.  It's tragic.  She was a pregnant woman.  Let's not forget that.  Why are they treating it like he was...  How was he convicted of murdering that, also?  Like, murder the wife, first degree, boom, death, kill him.  Why do they have to add on that he killed a child?  He didn't.  Couldn't...  Could this is...  I actually agree with that, just because he's such a scumbag.  Because I think they said that Connor could have survived outside the world,  and that was the argument.  Yeah, but a child isn't really a child until it comes out.  That seems to be the law that, you know, that we're going by, 
[03:12:30]  that we've decided to go by.  In this country.  And until it comes out, it isn't really, you know...  Well, women's groups actually, like, feminist movement,  will actually agree with you.  Because they were afraid that anything that identified a fetus  as having a right of some sort would chip into Roe v. Wade.  But I don't think...  Slippery slope can apply to anything.  What happens here?  What happens if a woman's pregnant?  Something happens where perhaps she's injured,  and the baby dies inside her. 
[03:13:00]  Is somebody now responsible,  if they were responsible for injuring the mother and baby there,  but the mother doesn't die,  could you then be brought up on charges of murder for the child?  I don't know the technicality of that.  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  Because that would be...  If you murdered her intentionally, probably, yeah.  Apparently, you can be.  Like, if you punched her...  I mean, if it was a car accident,  if you and me brought up on murder charges,  but if you punched her, yeah.  And the baby died,  but the mother didn't,  you could then be charged with murdering something that isn't really...  It's a good question.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But just because that technicality exists 
[03:13:30]  doesn't mean that such a predator who does that shouldn't be charged.  You know what I mean?  But that's something that has to be worked out.  It just seems odd that they gave the fetus a little name.  Yeah.  Which they do.  I know people do that when they have kids, you know.  And that people are really kind of thinking of this  like it's Lil Conner running around,  Mama, these for you, yapping and talking.  A little fetus.  I understand it's tragic and all,  but let's all get a grip here.  And let's be honest.  He may have hated flowers when he was born.  Who knows?  Might have been allergic to him.  And he may have been a bad boy and knocked her flowers over. 
[03:14:00]  Scott may have saved that family a lot of grief.  With a lot of stained rugs.  Dave, what do you have for the show today?  Hey, what's up?  Norton and everybody.  Hi, Dave.  Yeah, man.  Like that motherfucker knows her or something.  You know, like writing a song about somebody he knows.  Like, is that something you hear up on the church stage special or something?  Yeah, the guy kind of wrote that like he knew her.  Yeah.  You know, how does he know her love was no, you know. 
[03:14:30]  Her love was no denial?  Yeah, apparently someone denied it.  Scott denied it.  Apparently her smile wasn't that bright.  No offense.  Somebody didn't like it right.  Yeah, that smile irked somebody.  Just a bit.  You want to write about somebody's love and smile, write about Amber's.  Apparently that was quite addicting.  James from Illinois.  What's up?  Hey, that guy is so unoriginal.  That tune is the Blue Bell Country ice cream.  What?  Melody.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  He ripped off the melody?  Okay.  He ripped off the melody from a commercial jingle. 
[03:15:00]  That's how pathetic he is.  We're trying to get this jerk off on the phone, but of course he won't come on the show.  Remembering.  We got his number and everything?  He won't come on?  I wasn't trying to.  Jason from Georgia.  What's up?  Hey, Jim, you're really unsympathetic about that faceless kid.  I mean, now that...  No, no, I'm not.  What's that?  The faceless kid you were talking about earlier.  I'm not unsympathetic.  I actually felt really bad.  I'm not unsympathetic at all.  And I even said I felt bad saying it. 
[03:15:30]  I wasn't trying to be a dick when I was saying that.  The video's up on opanthony.com.  I gotta say, it's horrific.  I feel bad for the parents.  Completely feel bad for them.  I mean, the kid looks like it has a lot of love.  It looks like it's living, quote, a normal life besides the fact that she doesn't really...  Well, she has a face.  It's just really effed up.  You know those calamari things from Star Wars?  Last Star Wars movie?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what the baby looks like.  Exactly.  With a little blonde wig on it.  Why did she...  So why did you say I was unsympathetic, sir? 
[03:16:00]  Remembering fish face.  What did he hang up?  He hung up.  I wanted to hear what he had to say.  He probably heard what you said about the spade shovel and blame me.  Oh, oh, oh.  That did look like a divot.  With a little blonde wig on.  Like you teed up on her nose and took a little whack.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that. 
[03:16:30]  It's bad for you.  Rob the Trucker.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, uh...  I listen to y'all show, man, every day.  I love it.  And, uh...  What I was gonna say was...  That, uh...  You know, we're talking about a prison pussy.  Scott Peterson's gonna be some prison pussy, ain't he?  Yeah, probably.  He'll be a popular guy.  Yeah.  I guess they'll...  They keep all them alone, though.  It's so hard to really get at these people.  Except Dahmer.  He was an easy target.  I heard that was over...  Dahmer wasn't even killed over his crimes, but over some... 
[03:17:00]  Something stupid.  In a prison line, he cut somebody.  Some disrespect in jail, they killed him over the wall.  Yeah, that's in jail, disrespect.  You can't do that.  That's what I heard.  But, yeah, uh...  I was watching the news, and they said, uh...  They did interviews with some of the prison inmates up there, and they said he wasn't gonna  make it.  They were gonna kill him.  They always say that, though, but for the most part, these guys always wind up just doing  fine in prison.  Although, they'd get their hands on him.  The guy did kill his pregnant wife and baby.  They probably would, uh... 
[03:17:30]  I know, but there's been more horrific crimes than that.  They don't like baby killers in prison, though.  No, they don't.  I mean, as much as we find it hilarious...  Not all of we.  Oh, yeah.  It's a big...  Most of we.  It's a big, fat we, all four of us.  No.  Most of we.  I'm still trying to understand this whole thing.  I'm trying to understand this obsession.  There he goes.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Merry Christmas. 
[03:18:00]  Wow, that came out of nowhere.  Isn't that horrible?  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was a great clip.  The sounds of Christmas Eve.  Well, do you want me to play some Christmas?  Give me a little Christmas song.  I don't think we have any instrumentals, though, do we?  Come on, Ben's looking.  Oh, there he goes.  Look at his hair.  It's all...  Exactly.  Ben's really nervous in the other studio trying to find the instrumental Christmas music. 
[03:18:30]  Ben doesn't know what he's doing.  He's just a mess.  He knows what he's doing.  He's bumbling around looking for a fan to comb his hair with.  He knows what he's doing.  No, it was crazy.  It was insane.  All right, Danny, start up the music.  Let's see if this works here.  All right, Derek.  I mean, Derek, start up the music.  Christmas Eve.  How long ago was that?  I don't know.  Was it two years ago?  It has to be, right?  Or was it just last year?  It has to be two years ago.  I'll bet your grandma and grandpa know.  I bet they do.  What the hell is this? 
[03:19:00]  It's Gary Hewie.  What song is it, though?  Is Gary Hewie coming in this year?  The Little Drummer Boy?  It doesn't sound Drummer Boy-ish yet.  Oh, here we go.  It doesn't sound very Christmassy.  Gary Hewie likes rocks.  It's like an 80s hairband rock type of rock.  That Mr. Grinch version he does is fantastic.  It really is.  We ought to actually play that.  I can't mean one, Mr. Grinch.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum-pum.  Wait, do they have that one in there? 
[03:19:30]  Pa-rum-pa-pum.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Me and my boat.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Came back a lot lighter than I went out.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Won't have to listen to her bitch anymore. 
[03:20:00]  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Give back those expensive baby toys.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Won't have to put up with crying noise.  Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  Return those Legos and buy a gift for Amber.  I wish that would rhyme.  Oh.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Oh.  Oh.  Little empty crib. 
[03:20:30]  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Grandma, grandpa's tears.  Pa rum pa pum.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Oh.  Boo hoo what could have been.  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Ha ha ha ha.  Oh.  What he did to his son.  Oh.  You can hear the splash. 
[03:21:00]  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Oh my.  I brought enough gas.  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh man.  Connor giggled.  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Little baby feet just kicking her tummy tum tum.  Oh no. 
[03:21:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Aw.  He was cute in the son of grandpa.  Pa rum pa pum pum.  Oh.  Rump pa pum pum pum.  Rump pa pum.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ooh.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:22:00]  Now I say goodbye pa rum pa pum pum pum.  Gonna craft an alibi pa rum pa pum pum pum.  Oh.  Oh.  That is really awful.  There he goes.  Merry Christmas everyone.  Merry.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  It's a tough one to go unprepared on.  It's such an odd beat.  Yes.  It certainly is.  Everyone have a Peterson Christmas.  Ha ha ha.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:22:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  No lights on that house this year.  Nope.  No.  No sure.  No little patter of footsteps going to the Christmas tree with wonder in his eyes.  Yeah.  Maybe a little salt water and coral.  Not much else.  Maybe there'd be a little bite taken out of an oyster.  Left for a Santa.  Oh.  Oh Jesus. 
[03:23:00]  Soggy stockings wrapped around.  her neck with candy.  I just don't get it.  I just don't get this obsession.  That is horrible.  That you guys have.  Oh my god.  Is that horrible.  Just explain to me why.  That's all I need to know.  Why, why, why.  That's what grandma's saying.  Why.  Why. 
[03:23:30]  Oh yes.  Oh.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We did get three more Lacey songs in.  Those are so good.  Are they real songs or parodies?  I don't know.  We haven't listened to them.  We didn't have time today.  I haven't heard these.  We'll try the first one.  We remember Lacey.  All right. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Kenny G.  This is good already.  She lifted us when we were down. 
[03:24:30]  She laughed and hurt  And showed us how to love every time  She knew where she was headed  And she knew someday she'd be gone  Gone straight to heaven  My way up the ocean 
[03:25:00]  Where princess and John live on  Horace  Horrible  I'm getting none of these people on the phone  I stink and I don't like it  With a star high in the sky 
[03:25:30]  Her life will forever shine through  All right.  All right.  Enough of that one.  Enough of that one.  Why don't we have none of these guys on the phone?  Yeah.  Who is that guy?  Are we trying to get these people on the phone?  I don't know.  That are writing these stupid songs?  Can you go to drippynonsense.com and download that?  Huh?  Steve said he's been contacting them  And a little luck  Well, let's say it's the Greg and Tony show  Greg and Tony in New York or whatever 
[03:26:00]  They want to have a yawn and talk about your song?  Are you trying to say we have a bad reputation  As Hopi and Anthony?  Your reputation stinks  You're lucky I come on  It really does  You guys are creeps  All you do is make Peterson jokes  If I wrote a tribute  I wouldn't want it  Who?  The guys that had sex  Yeah, I'm sure they want it  I haven't made one Peterson joke  You haven't  But you haven't turned mics off either  So you're equally responsible  You allowed the crimes to happen  You just tore down the third wall  Opie  You just tore down the third wall  This for you  You just broke one of the rules of the show 
[03:26:30]  What was that?  You tore down the third wall  And explained what goes on here  What goes on here?  How did Lacey teach us to love, by the way?  Um, I don't know  She taught me to laugh  Alright, here's another Lacey song  It's just called Lacey's Song  Lacey's Song  Well, that's the easiest way  Wait, didn't we just play this?  More bells and sap  Yes  These are bells  These are the chains that were weighing her down  Bells equal  Eagling on the way down 
[03:27:00]  Sap  Did they say swollen face or smiling face?  I think it was smiling  Let's see what the rhyme is going to be  After she says  It's your smiling face  That still sounds like swollen face  It's your smiling face  Um, now covered with tape 
[03:27:30]  Well, you continue  I don't know that  That I can't erase  That I can't replace  Alright  From my mind  That we hold together  She's not even rhyming  It's the way you laugh  It's the way you cry 
[03:28:00]  What?  What?  No one even knows how she laughs  Yeah  Warm and pray  Who's she hugging?  An anchor?  Where's the chorus?  You are the light in all my darkness  What?  What?  Who?  Is this about Lacey?  My heart is lost  Whining bitch  Ugh 
[03:28:30]  This is so bad  Your smile can reach around the world  And call my name  This couldn't be about Lacey  Oh yeah, she did say smiling face  Did she say Lacey though?  I didn't hear one Lacey in that  Nah, these people just sent in love songs  Saying that they're tributes  Jack off  Who sent that piece of crap in?  I want to get that guy on the phone 
[03:29:00]  Who sang that one song  Remembering Lacey  We gotta hear it again  John Stark  We got another one?  Mama, this for you  You  The wood block  Very popular  This might be the Remembering Lacey, right?  That's it?  The original?  Yeah, this is the original  Oh yeah, here's the one we love  But we gotta play it  All kidding aside, folks  All kidding aside  Remembering Lacey  How her smile would make you smile 
[03:29:30]  Remembering Lacey  How she loved there's no denial  How the angels hold her gently  And little Connor's with her too  And she smiles and says  We're alright  And we send our love to you  So full of life and happiness  Was pretty Lacey's life 
[03:30:00]  Yeah!  With little Connor on the way  Just made things seem so right  Still the two of them together  From the start to heaven's door  And she smiles and says  We love you  To the one she's loved before  The tears that fell  Made flowers bloom 
[03:30:30]  On earth in heaven too  And little Connor runs and picks them  Mama, these for you  Now the angels are preparing  Special tributes from afar  As you gaze into the heavens  Look, the Lacey Connor song  The Lacey Connor reef 
[03:31:00]  All right  This song is awful  Oh, what a drippy douchebag 
[03:31:30]  God, are these people awful  Thanks  We're getting instant feedback  Thanks  I got that fucking song stuck in my head  For another day  Mama, these for you  These for you  That's what Scott said  This is for you  Was that the only other songs?  Yeah, we're done with this  No more serious ones?  Yeah  We're done with this  Lacey Connor reef 
[03:32:00]  This is so horrible  All right  I hope  I really  Hope that guy finds out  That your  Your vain attempt  At a heart tugger  Has given us  Hours and gales of laughter  Thank you, stupid  Next tragedy  Maybe that one  Will take off  Yeah, maybe that one  You can latch onto  And seem like  You're a concerned  Deep artist  You fuck  This email from 
[03:32:30]  Cervic Construction  Says  Hey, Lacey  You scratched my anchor  Cervic Construction  Cold from Texas  What's up?  I'm a free play convert  And this has got to be  The most vile seven cents  I've ever spent  It really is awful  We agree  It's only seven cents a day, sir  Hey, man  I'm spreading the virus  Via the U.S. Postal Service  I'm a rural carrier  Oh, great  Nice  Thank you  Thank you so much  Oh, you're welcome  All right  Did he say rural carrier? 
[03:33:00]  Male carrier  Oh  Remembering Lacey  Smile and make his  Ta  Like he built  Big build up  At the end  The Lacey Pearson  Star  Oh  And we'd all enjoy  Watching his  Trial  Verdict was death  As they strap him  To the journey  And there's some angels  Waiting for you 
[03:33:30]  On your journey  There's no angels  Unless it's like  Walking in prophecy  Now that would be  A fun angel to hang with  No one is watching her  And welcoming her  Like it's a big  Welcoming party in heaven  No  They see that shit  All the time  Get in line, bitch  Welcome to heaven  Stand in line  Hard enough sweet angels  To take care of every person  Yeah  Let's have a party  In their honor  And coddle them  Hold them  She's in an angel's arms  Like a hot night club  You gotta be dressed right 
[03:34:00]  You gotta be the right people  Exactly  No one's gonna want her  In the club  That big fucking  Pregnant house coat  Dripping wet  Killing everybody's vibe  Jesus  We know who you are  We saw the news  Big shot  She couldn't even go out  Anyways  You can't find a babysitter  A little Connor  Yeah, he's too young  To get in  Yeah  But her smile  Can make us smile  Yeah  Remembering the way  She loved  How'd she love?  The laughs  Yeah, the laughs  Alright, we'll play this again 
[03:34:30]  Remembering Benny  His gossip makes you smile  He's herking and jerking  And look  And little Connor  Picks up his phone  And says  Mama  This for you  And Ben just shakes his head  The Ben sparks  Messy hair  Remembering Ben's toilet  All the brown under the sea 
[03:35:00]  It looked like Bosnia  As he shit and threw up on his feet  Yeah, I know this is a listen request  A lot of requests for this Spongebob thing  Ben is puking  His bile made us smile  He combs his hair with a spiked bat  And his logs look like chocodiles 
[03:35:30]  Well, they  All right  Yeah, they want to hear this  And Connor runs up with Pepto-Bismol  Benny, this for you  Remembering Ben's part  We called him Gravy Leg  We called him Gravy Leg  Oh, Gravy Leg  All the pain he felt  In his asshole 
[03:36:00]  Like he was passing  An egg  And Connor ran up with a comb  And said  Ben, this for you  The worst  Of Oki and Anthony  I know  People  We all took those  They don't think  We all took those chances growing up  When you're younger  You just do stupid things  You know something  There was always a little bit of thought to it  You gotta think sometimes 
[03:36:30]  What are you  I don't know  Go, go, what  I always remember  Giving thought to consequence  Even growing up  Your whole life?  I did some really stupid things  But there was always the thought of the consequence  That's why I never did anything  That might put other people in danger  You know  Hey, let's roll this down this hill into the road  You know  When a car drives by  And I have friends that do that all the time  Even as simple as throwing the snowballs  At the cars as they drive by  And I always thought 
[03:37:00]  What would happen  You know  If it goes through an open window  Cracks the guy  He swerves and hits a pole  And not that I didn't care about  Killing anyone  I just didn't want to go to jail  But it was always thinking about the consequence  Me and my brothers got the shit beat out of us one day  I gotta give them a call  And see how old we were  But we were doing that exact thing  Throwing the snowballs at the cars  It's really a mainstay of youth  Thinking we were like being, you know  Cool  And uh-huh  Look at that  We hit that car  You know  But we were throwing like ice balls  And stuff  Hear that dull thud  On the side of the door 
[03:37:30]  And every time we hit one  Because we lived on a very busy street  So the cars are coming by like crazy  So we're just throwing the snowballs  Hear the brakes come on  And they slide on the ice  Oh yeah  We're laughing  We think it's the funniest freaking thing  You know  I swear  I don't think I was more than 12 years old  Maybe even less  And next thing I know  I guess what happened  Was one of these guys  Probably in his mid-twenties  I would say  Those are the ones that chase you  He like  We didn't know this  But we hit his car  And we're laughing  You know  And I guess he went up the road a little bit 
[03:38:00]  And stopped  You gotta do the flanking maneuver  Oh he flanked  He did a flanking maneuver  He was like two houses away  He comes through the woods  Back around  And we're still throwing snowballs  And he just attacks us  Of course he did  And beats the crap out of us  Good  And we're just little kids  You know  Do you know how cool it is  In that situation  When your car does get hit  You're of the age  Where you're gonna confront these kids  And you pull over  And pull it off  You outflank them  You go all the way around 
[03:38:30]  And the whole time  You're just thinking  These little sons of bitches  I hope they're still there  And when you see them there  The feeling you get  Oh victory  I'm gonna go in there now  And kick these little bastards asses  We never thought about consequences  Growing up  At all  I don't know why  I don't think it was instilled in me  From my parents or anything  It was just one of those things  I always thought  That this could get me really screwed  And I better just stay out of this  I wake up some mornings in a cold sweat  Cause I'll think about some of the stuff  I did growing up 
[03:39:00]  And go I can't believe  I took those chances  As a college kid  Or what have you  You know  Yeah  So  There was sometimes  You would think about  You know  I would do things  That might have endangered myself  Especially with cars  When you're growing up as a teen  And stuff like that  Who didn't drive drunk  Growing up  You drive stupid  But I'm the best drunk driver  In the world though  I don't even want to hear it  I don't even want to hear it  I'm great  I don't even swerve  But  You would pass the Brady Bunch test  But as a  Yeah  With the egg on the cone  Of course  You could do that  With like a 
[03:39:30]  Twelve pack  Twelve  Jesus  Who am I talking to  A case of beer  But that's just  Yeah  But that's just  Driving drunk  Because  Whenever I would drive drunk  And I really don't anymore  But when I would  I would  I would drive  Very good  I wouldn't speed  I would pay attention  To all the lights  And everything  It's when I'm not drinking  That you know  You drive a little faster  You might  Skirt that red light  A little bit  You know  Things like that  But drunk  You gotta drive good  You'd be stupid  To drive like an idiot 
[03:40:00]  We all did  And back in the day  Man the cops  Would let you off the hook  Remember  I think a lot of us  Have the story where  Go right home  Right home  No  You never had a cop  Take your buddy's keys  And make you wait around  Until his shift was over  And then come back  Give you the keys back  So you could drive home  That's the lesson  They used to teach you  Instead of locking you up  You never had one of those happen  No  Wow  I guarantee  We go to the phones  We'll have a ton of them  I got pulled over  With a case of beer  With a few taken out  On my passenger seat  I was driving down  The expressway  And I got pulled over 
[03:40:30]  I don't know  I think it was just because  I had long hair  And I was driving  An old beat up Nova  But I got pulled over  And the cop sees  The beers on the seat  And gives me a breathalyzer  And I passed it  And he said  He goes  I could hold you here  A little longer  And make you do it again  To see if it got  In your bloodstream  But I was talking fine  I wasn't slurring  I wasn't weaving or anything  And he let me go  Just let me go  Go ahead  The good old days  Now forget about it  You are locked up  Yeah no  We used to get really hammered
