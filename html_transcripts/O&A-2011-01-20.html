<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and their “out-of-control” show. They discuss the fleeting nature of internet fame, exemplified by a former internet sensation’s quick decline.  Opie then details his VIP treatment from the New York Rangers as a “free agent” fan, including a lavish buffet and meeting Ron Duguay and Kim Alexis. This is followed by a hilarious showing of Opie’s video of a near-fatal altercation between a taxi driver and another driver, featuring a comedically unintelligible interview with the taxi driver. A call from NHL Home Ice discusses similar fan campaigns. The segment concludes with more Rangers anecdotes and a comedic bit about the staff’s weight gain, focusing on a new Burger King’s “Whopper Bar” and its incredibly high-calorie menu items, including a pizza burger with over 2500 calories.

Opie recounts a humorous, unnamed anecdote he experienced with Roland, promising to reveal it later.  They promote comedian Rich Voss's upcoming “Jewish Intervention” segment focusing on his frugal spending habits.  They also announce Stephen Merchant as a later guest. The show then launches into a critical discussion of Michael Moore's commentary on gun violence and race in America, with Opie and Anthony disagreeing strongly. They cite statistics on home invasions and gun violence, highlighting the disproportionate involvement of young black males, and discuss perceived media bias favoring white victims in missing persons cases.  Caller Justin from Tampa agrees with the hosts' assessment of media bias. A caller, "Afro Nerd," advocates for martial law in high-crime areas, sparking a heated debate about race and class.  Other callers contribute diverse opinions, ranging from agreement with the hosts to critiques of systemic inequalities. The discussion touches on media bias, economic factors, and personal responsibility.  The segment ends with the hosts noting the failure of a Pop-Tart themed store in Times Square, a prediction they'd previously made.

The show continues with a discussion of civilian violence sparked by caller "Scotty" who details the violence in sub-Saharan Africa using strong language.  The hosts express amusement.  The conversation shifts to race relations in America, with a host expressing frustration over restrictions on open discussion of race for white people. The show then features comedian Rich Voss in studio for his “Jewish Intervention” segment. Voss recounts humorous stories of his extreme frugality and bargain hunting, including his attempts to get the best deal on an iPad. The segment also includes discussions of American Idol (criticizing the judges), the Octomom, and the show "I Should Be Dead," about a woman lost in the Grand Canyon.  Personal anecdotes from the hosts, including a near-death gas leak experience, are shared, and Voss's upcoming shows are promoted.

The show moves on with a discussion about a hiking mishap and near-death experiences, transitioning into a conversation with guest Stephen Merchant. Merchant discusses his career with Ricky Gervais, including firings due to on-air stunts, and their current status. They discuss the creation of their recurring character, Carl, known for his dimwittedness and unintentionally hilarious observations, especially in their animated series.  The conversation turns to a darkly humorous discussion about potential beneficiaries of the 9/11 attacks. A caller, "Stephen Jersey," shares a story of how his wife's sister's death in the attacks resolved a personal issue.  The show continues with a discussion about the appropriateness of such humor, referencing Ricky Gervais' Golden Globes hosting, followed by a graphic discussion of a disturbing pedophilia-themed episode of *Different Strokes*. The show concludes with promotion of Merchant's projects and a final discussion of the show's format and audience.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  When you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Morning. 
[00:01:30]  Hi, everybody.  Morning.  And isn't it a fine morning?  I want my voice to be very caustic right away.  I got to work on a tone that just is very caustic.  Caustic.  Morning.  Is that almost there?  That's pretty caustic.  Because you're supposed to have a very comforting voice in the morning for these assholes that are waking up.  Very smooth. 
[00:02:00]  A lot of these guys, they set their alarm to our voices.  Like that bum that's not in the news anymore.  Oh, remember him?  Where is the bum?  What ever happened to that guy?  You know what?  I'm not even content on the news telling me what happened to him.  Remember that guy?  I want to know what that bum is doing right now.  That's how fast his career went.  We're already in the whatever happened to that guy stage.  That's how fast it happens these days in the days of what they call the intra-tubes.  That's right.  You get on. 
[00:02:30]  You're famous.  You're a YouTube sensation.  They embrace you for 10 minutes.  And then it's like, what happened to that guy?  And then they go to a video about kittens doing adorable things.  Yeah, yeah.  They could give a fuck about you.  Now it's all about, you know, the...  Yeah, I know he's in rehab somewhere.  But no one even cares.  And like, they would be asking like, all right, well, how's he doing?  What is this rehab?  Like, what do they do when he's there?  Like, no one cares.  And the sad part is he is in rehab for three months in Texas. 
[00:03:00]  Not 60 days.  Three fucking months.  Three months.  That's how bad his shit was.  And he needed the next three months to capitalize on his golden voice.  Because he's going to come out and no one's going to care anymore.  No one's going to care.  They're going to be moving on to the next homeless bum doing some ridiculous thing that's cool.  On the internet, yeah.  Because we're all out there now with our cameras trying to...  Oh, yeah.  I interviewed Jesus the other day.  Really?  I haven't posted the video yet.  Is he back?  Jesus is back.  He likes to spell his name G-E-S-U-S. 
[00:03:30]  That's the new century spelling, yeah.  And unfortunately, my bum...  Is that like Junior Mints?  He spells like G-E-E-E.  Right.  Yeah.  You got to do the alternate spelling.  So I interviewed Jesus thinking I might be the guy that finds the next Ted Williams.  Nah, he's just a bum.  No talent, just a bim.  That fucking spells Jesus with a G.  A G.  I'm like, thanks.  Everyone knows you don't do that. 
[00:04:00]  Thanks.  Was he Hispanic?  Because he must have...  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He's as white as they come in.  Say he probably really didn't like Hispanics, didn't want to be confused with Jesus.  Quite frankly, he looks a little like Jesus.  He really does.  Did he?  But he's in the pouring rain with a blanket wrapped around him, so...  Well, Jesus didn't live, you know, high on the hog.  Wasn't living the life of Riley.  No.  I mean, I'm taping all the time.  I don't even know if I'm going to post it.  Living the life of Jesus.  But, you know, this is... 
[00:04:30]  I'll just show Anne off my...  Yeah, I want to see what he looks like.  I'm walking up to him right now.  You know, this is the raw fucking footage.  There's Jesus.  There's my Ted Williams.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Hey, it's Christian Bale.  He looks a little like Christian Bale?  Actually, or he looks like the guy from...  What's his name?  Lord of the Rings.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a little Lord of the Rings thing happening.  Yeah, yeah.  But the problem is, it's in the middle of Manhattan.  It's not in some fucking...  Where was Lord of the Rings?  Help me out.  Yeah, fucking middle of...  In the land far away?  Middle Earth.  Middle Earth.  New Zealand? 
[00:05:00]  No, I'm not talking about the place they filmed it.  What place was it supposed to be?  Middle Earth?  Middle Earth.  Okay.  Yeah, he looks like...  He would look great if he was in Middle Earth, but it's Manhattan, and people are trying  to fucking, you know, get some chores done.  Could you move out of my way?  You boom.  He was on his way to Mordor, yes.  Yeah, Mordor.  Thank you.  He was on his way to Mordor.  That's what I was going for.  Fucking Iraq goes New Zealand.  No.  That's where they filmed the movie.  New Zealand.  He's talking about the actual, you know, fantasy movie. 
[00:05:30]  So, yeah, Ted Williams is in rehab, and he needed to make his money now.  Yeah, this is a strike while the liver's swollen.  Right.  You really need to get out there.  Get your voice out there, your face.  But he couldn't even do it for a week.  No.  Before he had to grab onto the booze, and that was it.  Mm-hmm.  Goodbye.  Last night, I was telling you a little before the show, but last night, I've officially 
[00:06:00]  become a free agent hockey fan.  Free agent, so you're open to any offers from other teams?  Yeah, we've talked about this over the years.  You know, when you show a dedication to one team year after year after year, and then  you realize the players don't give a shit.  No.  And this is across the board in every sport.  I know my Jets will even do this.  And then you realize, wait, why am I dedicated to a team where the players could care less,  and, you know, they're just looking for their next, you know, good team to jump on?  So the fans should be able to do the same thing. 
[00:06:30]  Jump ship.  So my Islanders are sucking so bad.  They're like the second or third worst team in hockey right now.  They're right at the bottom.  And they've been out of the playoffs since November, and they play hockey until May, just  to give you an idea.  So it's, I mean, we knew in November that this team wasn't even going to have a shot  at the playoffs.  Yeah.  So I figured this is a great year to become a free agent fan and really experiment with  this.  And last night, the Rangers whined and dined me.  I tweeted a couple pictures.  So this is almost like, yeah, like a player where they would take them out and talk to 
[00:07:00]  them.  Yes.  They whined and dined me.  And fuck, I tweeted just a couple pictures, and people are fucking pissed off.  They want you to still be an Islander fan?  The Islander fans want me to be an Islander fan.  They're like, oh, you know, when they become good again, we don't want you.  That's what people were writing me.  We don't want you.  We don't need you, fair weather fan.  Fair weather fan.  Fair weather. 
[00:07:30]  It's been storming for years.  Thank you, Anthony.  I mean, you can see some blue skies every so long.  Yeah.  You can only take so much.  And then the Rangers fans.  Ah, fucking stay on Long Island, you faggot.  All right.  We don't want you.  No one wants you.  You can't just switch like that.  They do get very, very possessive.  They're really offended.  But I did something called the, I don't know, I guess they're called Legends seats and  stuff.  Legends.  And they bring in a room and they got a buffet with really nice roast beef. 
[00:08:00]  You know the deal.  Nice carving station.  Oh, carving station.  I love the carving station.  A little pasta area.  Yeah.  They had shrimp and lobster as big as your fist.  As big as your fist.  And I'm sitting there fucking just looking like a bum myself while everyone else was  dressed up because I guess they take this thing very seriously.  The Legends very seriously?  What are they, like in suits?  Oh, yeah, suits.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  This is a night out for a lot of people.  This is like, save your money.  We're doing the Legends seats thing.  Did you wear your formal sweats? 
[00:08:30]  I wore this.  I'm still wearing my clothes.  I wore this.  $600 a ticket.  Wow.  With a nice dessert area.  All the booze you can drink if that's your thing.  That's craziness.  Not so much my thing anymore.  Now, there's no way.  There's no way an Islander fan wants to invest $600 for Ranger tickets.  No.  And then I sort of had a little guilt, but being a free agent fan, I had to go with it.  I mean, the whole room's filled with Ranger jerseys, and I guess there were some Legends 
[00:09:00]  walking around.  I didn't recognize anybody.  Legends?  Ranger Legends, obviously.  I went with Roland and a couple other guys, and it was pointed out that the Rangers walking  around in this room, as we eat from a buffet, are probably not doing well after their playing  days.  Oh, so...  Let's just put it this way.  You're not going to see a Wayne Gretzky walking around with fans in a room like this.  I wouldn't think so.  Were you able to wish Mark Messier a happy 50th birthday? 
[00:09:30]  I didn't see Mark Messier.  Oh, no Messier there either.  I did get to see Ron Duguay, though.  Oh, well.  And Ron Duguay...  Was he wearing Jordache jeans?  He might as well have.  Or Sasson.  He looks exactly the same, except for the fact that his face is a bit weathered.  Is that it?  He's got the exact same hair.  Oh, God.  And he's walking around, and then you've got a publicist-type person.  She's like, are you ready for your picture with Ron Duguay?  Am I?  So I felt like just being... 
[00:10:00]  I felt like being an asshole yesterday, so I go to the lady.  Tell you the truth, I'm way more famous than Ron Duguay.  Oh, they don't like hearing that.  I did that to crack up the people at the table.  I really don't have that type of fucking ego.  You say that all the time.  I'm much too famous.  And this twat openly laughs at me and doesn't even ask, well, who are you?  Maybe she was sticking it to you.  She's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, that's funny.  You're funny. 
[00:10:30]  I'm funny.  Thinking, I mean, look how I dress.  Thinking I'm just some bum that is making believe they might do something cool with their lives.  And she walks away.  And what position did she hold?  She was like the person that brought Ron Duguay around so he could get pictures with the legend.  And she really doesn't give a shit about anything but her job that night.  Right.  And then he was in a suit and tie, and we took a picture, and I go, well, someone here is dressed a little better than me. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, boy.  It was so douchey.  Embarrassing.  I want to see the picture, though.  I think it's online.  I've got to see a Ron Duguay.  It's one of those pictures where you have to now go online and punch in your fucking, you know, your code.  Your little code.  Right.  So you could buy the picture.  We had a picture because they gave us a nice gift bag with all Rangers stuff.  And I did feel guilty being an Islanders fan since I was, I don't know, like, what, 11, 12?  Yeah, put it on eBay. 
[00:11:30]  In a long time.  And people just pissed off because it was a calendar, a little magnet, a little T-shirt.  Oh, that's good stuff if you're a Ranger fan.  A Rangers pen.  Did you get a puck?  No.  They should have gave, for $600, they should have gave us a puck and a real jersey.  It should have been a puck in there.  It should have been a puck.  This is the shit they gave you.  And a silver Sharpie.  Thank you, kid.  So you could have gotten Ron Duguay to sign the puck.  No, Ron Duguay signed that picture right in front of me.  That's a real jersey.  But is it real?  Oh, it is. 
[00:12:00]  And that's a Let's Go Rangers Magnet set.  Yeah.  That thing in the weird jewelry box, I don't even know what that is.  It's like a pin that you'd probably trade.  Does that come with home and away jerseys?  Oh, it doesn't?  It sure does.  Holy shit.  Wow, that is a good collection.  There was no pin attached to that weird tiny little blue Rangers jersey in the jewelry  box thing.  I don't know what that was.  Maybe you wing it onto the ice during games.  Yeah, I should have.  And then there's the Rangers calendar and a Rangers planner.  A pen?  A pen.  A Rangers planner.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  And then they escort us down to just amazing seats right behind where the Rangers shoot  twice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was great.  That ain't bad.  That sounds like a fun night.  And poor Ron Duguay because it's a section that's maybe, I'll say about 20 to 25 seats.  It's like a little boxed in area and it's all gray seats.  Very important.  No one's allowed in this area.  They protect it.  And Ron Duguay sits down.  He has to fucking watch the game with us assholes.  Yeah.  What happened to his life? 
[00:13:00]  Why is he doing this?  They probably dumped some money on him and he's like, yeah, I'll sit with some fucking  fans and give some money.  And the best part about it was he brought his supermodel wife.  And I forgot he married a supermodel.  Yeah, I didn't remember her name.  Do you remember Kim Alexis?  Of course.  She's sitting there.  I'm like, holy shit, that's Kim Alexis.  I remember jerking off to her.  She was pretty smoking in the old days.  You got any pictures of her, Danny, in what I like to call the day? 
[00:13:30]  I call it the day.  There she is in the day.  Holy shitcakes.  All right.  And you know what?  I'm telling you right now, I need to know.  Oh, my God.  I need to know an age on Kim Alexis, but I'm telling you, she looked awesome.  Did she?  Oh, wait.  Bikini pic.  Way to go.  The ass.  She looked great.  Let's see that one.  Oh, I remember that one.  Oh, that was from the swimsuit issue, of course.  Good God.  Look at that ass.  Good God. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my God.  And then she's in Mommy.  And then she's in Mommy Magazine, so.  Oh, now it's like the new Kim Alexis.  She cut all her hair off.  Yeah, cut that beautiful hair off.  She's got the Mommy hairdo now.  But she still looks hot as all hell.  And she's got to be.  Yeah, I don't.  Yeah, there's Ron.  Oh, is that a recent picture?  That's exactly what he looked like last night.  Whoa.  Ron Duguay.  I guess I was supposed to be excited to meet him.  I don't know.  Well, yeah, if you're a Rangers fan that's not like I'm in the inner circle, you'd probably be excited. 
[00:14:30]  And then I saw a great game.  Rangers won 7-0 against the Toronto Maple Leafs.  Oh.  And one of the guys scored four goals last night.  That never happens.  Got to see a hat trick plus one.  Hat trick plus.  Everyone throwing their hats on the old ice.  Did they do that?  She is 50.  I nailed it.  I said, I bet you she's 50 years old.  So she doesn't look 50, but I was just doing the math in my head that she, you know, is a long time ago as far as the supermodel thing goes. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Not looking that bad for Fiddy, that's for sure.  So first stop as a free agent fan went very well, Anthony.  Very well.  Free agent fan.  They're wooing you.  Any other teams in your sights?  I like to say in your sights.  In the crosshairs, Opie?  Actually, yes.  The Flyers actually tweeted me last night.  The Flyers tweeted you?  Okay.  But I want to get on some planes and check out some teams, too.  I want to try to make this. 
[00:15:30]  You're going to really make the rounds?  I want to try to make this into a thing.  Have them woo you?  Yeah.  There you go.  Maybe we could get the story to Home Ice because Home Ice loves the Opie and Anthony show.  They talk hockey all the time on Home Ice.  So I want the boys on Home Ice to know that I'm officially a free agent fan and so far went very well with the Rangers.  They brought out Ron Duguay.  You're going to do a cross-country trip?  I would love to.  Maybe a Kings fan?  What are you doing?  No, no.  I would go Coyotes before I do an L.A. thing. 
[00:16:00]  What about Edmonton?  Edmonton would be nice.  Vancouver because I would like to check out their city.  Maybe where else would I go?  That ain't bad.  I'd check out Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh?  And I would check out the Capitals.  It's close.  You could go to some home games.  I think I've got to do an East Coast thing for my new team.  What about something as easy as the Devils?  No.  No.  That's right over there.  I want to be put up in a hotel and, you know.  How are the Devils going to woo you? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  Take you to fucking Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Take me to Camden.  Take you to Camden.  Drop you off if you survive.  You're a fan.  So far the Rangers did well.  Very well.  The fucking prime rib and roast beef and everything else they had was great.  And Ron Duguay.  And Ron Duguay.  And Tim Alexis.  The bar has been set.  And other Rangers, I think.  The bar has been set.  There's a good suggestion, of course, from Sonny.  What about the Bruins?  The Bruins?  Your old haunt of Boston. 
[00:17:00]  The Bruins would really have to step up their game to, you know, to woo me into Boston to  check out their stuff.  Yeah.  They would have to, like, you know.  What would they have to do?  Something, uh, what would they do?  Lunch with LB?  Well, how do you beat?  That's inside and really funny.  I like the LB.  I never had a problem with the LB.  I hope it was cool.  It sucks that he's part of a shitty show.  That goon.  Because that guy is really fucking funny and talented.  But he just got stuck with a shitty show. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  They have to do better than a Ron Duguay slash Kim Alexis meeting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a good one.  Yeah, they would have to do...  Well, the bar's set high.  That's nice.  Because you can only go up from there.  Right.  If they don't offer you enough, you can just tell them to go fuck themselves easy.  And then on the way home, I showed you the video.  I just posted it on my YouTube channel.  I almost saw a death.  And I was thinking about you, actually, Anthony.  Oh, nice.  I was wondering if you've ever pulled a move like I just showed you on my flip.  Hmm.  The whole video is up on the YouTube channel, OP Radio. 
[00:18:00]  Have you ever had a guy that you might have bumped in traffic?  I don't know if...  I couldn't understand the guy because I interviewed him after the fact.  And honestly, it even says on the screen, please translate this.  I have no idea what the fuck.  But I guess one of the black cars...  Yeah, those Lincoln Town cars.  The black cars and the cabbies hate each other in New York City.  Mortal enemies.  And I guess one...  I guess the black car tapped a cab, I think.  And meanwhile, they're like the half-black, half-white guy episode of Star Trek where the 
[00:18:30]  guy goes, yeah, but he's black on the right side.  I'm black on the left side.  And we hate each other.  It's like the black car drivers and the cabbies, they hate each other, but they're the same  assholes.  They pretty much are.  Yay!  So, the video picks up, and you can check it out for yourself, where the cabbie, obviously  at this point, I didn't see it, jumped out of his car and now is so pissed off at the  black Lincoln...  It's a Lincoln, you said?  Yeah, Lincoln Town cars. 
[00:19:00]  So, he wants to prevent the guy from driving through the intersection, so he's in front  of his car, like, trying to stop him, and the black car is, you know, just going slowly  at first.  Yeah, a little nudge.  But the guy firmly has both of his hands on the hood of the car, and he's being pushed  backwards by the Lincoln Town car, slowly at first, kind of bumping him.  The Lincoln Town car is basically saying, really?  Yeah, yeah.  And he's pushing him a little bit.  He's hitting the gas a little bit, like, get the fuck out of my way. 
[00:19:30]  The guy's pulling a Tiananmen Square tank deal, and then the guy goes, fuck this, steps on  the gas, and actually gets this guy sliding backwards on his heels.  Yeah.  And if he would have fallen backwards...  He would have been dead.  Dead!  I almost fucking videoed a murder.  And people are like, what do you mean a murder?  Wouldn't that be a murder?  That would be manslaughter.  All right, let's go with manslaughter.  Could you go back just to the interview, because you've got to hear this guy trying to explain...  Gross Negligence. 
[00:20:00]  What happened?  And then this can't be...  So what happened?  That guy cut you off?  He has splintered you, right?  There's nothing to happen.  I don't know.  He had a splinter.  But why were you, like, fighting with the car?  Why were you in front of the car?  He said, I had a splinter.  I said something happened.  But why were you, like, fighting with the car?  Why were you in front of the car, like, fighting it?  We are coming to that...  No, I understand that.  But why would you jump out of your car?  Because I need to stop here.  This guy, because he...  He needs to torpedo him.  He hits your leg?  In the leg, yes. 
[00:20:30]  He needs to...  That's why he stopped here, but he stopped here.  And when he picked up the vehicle...  He backed up a barnacle.  He hit your car.  And he hit your car.  He hit...  No, no, my car.  But he hit me.  Yeah, he hit you.  Because why?  You jumped out to...  He hit me!  Say, hey, you hit this car.  I know.  He, first of all, he...  He dropped something in my car, like this.  Ah.  What are you doing?  I don't say nothing.  So, okay, let's go.  On a driving.  And he was driving.  I wasn't driving.  I want to stop this guy. 
[00:21:00]  Why he was doing like this.  Ah, why was he, like...  I was doing like this.  Then I get a come to back.  And then he got a come to back.  And then he hit my car, something sliced.  And then he went to get a slice.  There's good pizza here.  And then I just...  Blocking the here.  And when I'm blocking, he sidelines the...  He sidelines the back.  He pick up the car.  When he pick up the car...  He sidelines, yeah.  He picked up the car.  This vehicle, it does this car.  So you jumped out.  I jumped out.  Because something was a beagle, too.  There was a beagle involved.  You wanted to, like, go to the cops and make sure he didn't go anywhere.  And all of a sudden, he took off, and you were in front of the car. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And he was pushing you, and you were trying to push a car.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  That's crazy.  He could have ran you over and killed you.  But I tell him, just block this road, and they're going to stop me here.  He told him to ball something?  I hear they come for us.  Yeah.  You all right?  I am totally fine, but I want to...  You know, this is a really big crime, you know?  Yeah.  This is a totally big crime.  He wasn't, like...  Totally big crime.  ...for me.  And then...  Yeah.  That's why the FDNY is pulling up with a giant fire truck. 
[00:22:00]  See, if that doesn't prove that the guy speaks horrendous English, like, a fire truck shows up.  He called 911, and a fire truck showed up.  And they figured, after listening to him for a minute, that they need a fire truck.  It's like, just, I think there's a fire.  This guy's mouth is burning.  He can't speak.  And it wasn't a coincidence.  The fire truck was there for him.  Yeah.  And what he was involved with had nothing to do with fire.  It could have been settled with one patrol car.  One cop could have gone down there and just taken a report, whatever the fuck it was. 
[00:22:30]  But the 911 operator's like, I don't know.  I think we need a fire truck.  That is Beagle, and Barniger, and save the ball, and get...  Oh, my God.  Just send a fucking fire truck.  Right.  Send a couple of things.  I think you've got to flush some F-16s.  This might be another terrorist attack.  I don't know what he's saying.  But the guy's nuts.  He sacrificed his own life to stop one of these cars.  What is he doing?  I've seen stuff like that.  You've seen it like that?  I mean, I can't say every day, because that would be exaggerated. 
[00:23:00]  But I have seen...  On a regular day?  Yeah, pretty fairly.  I mean, I find you lucky, because you actually got to talk to the guy and figure out what was  going on.  A lot of times, I'm in my car...  Who figured out what was going on?  You were talking to the guy.  Well, you know what I'm saying?  You had the opportunity to, anyway.  Because one time, I was in my car, and there was a guy arguing with a black car.  And he was a huge, ripped, like, huge, muscly, older guy.  He was holding this little teeny dog.  And then the light changed, and I guess the cabbie's not going to sit there and argue,  so he just takes off.  But now this guy wasn't done at this point. 
[00:23:30]  So now he's jogging down the block with his dog, holding his dog.  And it was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my car.  It was a little dog.  I tried getting video of it, and I really wanted to know what was happening, but I don't  have the patience to read around for shit like that.  I wish I could remember I have a camera on me a lot of times, because after certain situations  happen, you're just kind of like, oh, fuck, I had a camera.  I know.  And then you're like, hey.  Well, I missed a good 15 seconds of that, because I knew something really good was going  down.  And then what happens?  You go into panic fumble mode, and all of a sudden you... 
[00:24:00]  Get the shot.  Get the shot.  All of a sudden, you're like a Down syndrome kid.  You can't figure anything out.  You pulled your camera out.  You can't figure anything out.  You pulled your camera out a million times and just pushed, you know, fucking record.  But when some real shit's going on, all of a sudden, the most basic shit you can't do  anymore.  Yeah.  That's when the iPhone shutter stays closed, like the little animation of the shutter  just hangs there.  Come on.  What is...  Come on.  And it happens to all of us.  Like, what happens to your brain?  You just do freak out.  And I was fumbling, and I finally got it on, and I still got enough footage of the whole weird 
[00:24:30]  incident.  You know what?  There's got to be some kind of a device.  That can go on a chain around your neck.  We're heading that way.  That would just...  You go, oh, shit, something's going down.  And all you got to do is take it out and squeeze on it, press a button, and boom, you're  taking video.  We're heading that way.  Maybe it's Bluetooth-ing it to your fucking phone.  Because, I mean, I purposely carry around an AC flip wherever I go.  But when this thing went down, where the guy was, like, in the front of the car being 
[00:25:00]  pushed, and he's trying to push the car back, which that's...  Yeah, he didn't understand basic physics.  The amount of cameras that popped out.  Yeah.  And people were videotaping.  Yeah.  Because they all have their iPhones.  Fucking five different angles of this motherfucker.  What, a mere year to two years ago, it would be very rare to pick up on anything like this.  You know?  Yeah.  But now, man, everyone just pulled out their cameras and started fucking recording this.  That's why you can't really make a ruckus anymore.  You could maybe get away with something spontaneous, you know? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, okay.  We got a translation?  Is this a real translation?  I like the fake translations.  Because a guy just wrote...  A guy just wrote...  Oh, Jordan, thank you.  He's a regular on Instant Feedback.  He wrote, so he went to get a slice of bagel and the other car got in his way.  See?  That's pretty much...  Or a slice of beagle?  Slice of beagle.  Slice of beagle.  Is this the actual translation?  Someone just sent it to me, so I'm reading it with you.  All right.  I say, why would you jump out of your car?  And he calls him buddy. 
[00:26:00]  Because I need to path a need to stop does guy because he hit me.  That sounds reasonable.  Okay, it is a good translation.  He hit your leg, buddy.  In the leg, yes, pause.  So he stopped to there.  But he stopped to here on he pick up the P, Kel, und.  And he hit the bar.  Oh, he picked up a pickle and hit the bar.  Yeah, that's what I love doing.  I do that shit all the time.  It's like, hey, Danny, I'm going to pick up a pickle and I'm going to hit the bar. 
[00:26:30]  Dude, I'm there.  What are you doing?  I'm there.  So then I say, yeah, he hit your car.  Referring to Buddy 2.  I got Buddy 2's interview.  Maybe I'll slap it on the end of this video later today.  And your car.  And he hit your car.  And he says, no, not my car, but he hit me.  And then I say, yeah, he hit you because you jumped out to say, hey, you hit this guy.  And he says, no, pursed ob all.  Pursed ob all.  He is something.  He drops something on my car like this, waves arm, and go, what are you doing? 
[00:27:00]  I don't say nothing.  So, okay, let's go.  So when I dibbing.  Dribbing.  Oh, dribbing.  It's hard.  Okay, dribbing.  Sorry.  I should know the word dribbing.  So when I dribbing, he was dribbing.  I was dribbing, so I want to stop this guy.  Why he was a doing like this.  Then nothing.  Then I, you got to go back to this part on the video.  Then nothing.  Then I get a come to back. 
[00:27:30]  And again, he only hit my car.  Come on his back?  Something syllabus.  Slice.  And then car come around here.  Then I rolled out the chuck.  And then what's that word?  Tananable?  Tan-a-table store.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Tan-a-table.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The Tan-a-table store.  I need a new one.  Blocking day here.  And when I, uh, blow king, he said a lizz, lizz, it was bad.  He pick up the curry.  When he pick up the curry, he does like this vehicle across this car. 
[00:28:00]  It makes sense after he stops telling his story and Opie starts to talk again.  Tan-a-table store.  Booking day here.  Ricky.  Holy shit.  Oh, okay.  He translated at least.  Yeah.  That, uh, that guy, I have no idea what the fuck he was talking about.  Well, he transcribed.  I wouldn't call that a translation. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, transcribed, right.  Transcription.  I've got to have a transcription.  I told you they listened and they're huge fans of the show.  I put out the signal, and here they are from home ice.  NHL home ice.  What's up, guys?  How's it going?  It's going.  You're on the market, we hear.  We had our technical producer, the Paperboy.  He was a lifelong Maple Leafs fan, and this year, for about a month,  we had a little campaign to find a new team for him.  With the perennial losing and being out of the playoffs, 
[00:29:00]  so for a month, we invited fans to call us up and send along any bribes  that they wanted to send our way, and in the end, he went with the San Jose Sharks.  He did.  And the reason being, there's a fan out there who, I guess,  I don't know if she's an official photographer  or if she just takes pictures at their practice rink or whatever,  but she sent us a whole bunch of personally and personalized photos 
[00:29:30]  from various players and some other little goodies.  So that put the Paperboy over the top.  He became a Sharks.  Not even in a playoff spot now.  They're having one of their worst seasons in years.  So we're thinking he's the reason.  Oh, when you change teams.  Yeah, exactly.  And they tank.  That's not good.  It's something Ant and I have talked about for a while now on this show.  Why can't fans be free agents?  When these players are becoming free agents every year,  why do we always have to have the loyalty as fans?  Why can't we shop a new team? 
[00:30:00]  No, absolutely.  And you know what?  They actually, up in Ottawa, they tried about, I'd say,  probably about eight or nine years ago to get a fan association going.  And I think there's still some semblance of it somewhere.  But even there, they couldn't get enough people going  and get enough people sort of dedicated to the cause  to basically send the message that, you know what,  we're spending thousands of dollars on tickets and merchandise and all the rest.  And you're at a point now where, where is the loyalty? 
[00:30:30]  It seems to be a one-way street.  And enough's enough.  Yeah, but, man, the fans still get really mad.  I'm a season holder.  I mean, I have Islanders tickets.  I haven't gone to a game in two to two and a half months.  These tickets are just rotting in my desk.  I do give a bunch of them away when I'm not throwing them in the river  or out car windows and stuff.  And last night, I actually tried out the free agent thing as a fan  and went to the Rangers game, and they treated me like a king. 
[00:31:00]  Like gold.  I met Ron Duque last night.  Well, you know what?  That's huge, right, Ed?  That's huge.  The Rangers, as far as I'm concerned, are one of the teams.  I've only been MSG for a Rangers game once, but they do it right.  I mean, there are just teams out there that do it right.  And you could do worse than going to the Rangers right now.  They're playing some good hockey right now.  Yeah, but I'm an Islanders fan right now.  And to become a Rangers fan, that's really, really bad.  Yeah, that's the ultimate install. 
[00:31:30]  But I'm not like your paper boy or whatever the heck his name is.  I want to talk to the teams directly.  I don't want some fan to set me up with the next team.  I already got a tweet from somebody in the Flyers organization.  They want me to come down, and they want to whine and dine me next.  That's huge.  All right.  Well, we're going to put the message out here as well,  so we'll see if we can get some other NHL teams on board.  But if you want to come up here to Toronto, I'm not promising anything with the Maple Leafs,  but we've got the Hall of Fame.  We've got Gretzky's Restaurant.  A couple of good places to stop in. 
[00:32:00]  That's so pretty good.  All right.  Hey, you guys do a good job.  I do listen to you.  Thanks a lot.  We'll listen to you guys as much as we can as well.  We're going on the air in about 15 minutes.  So keep up the great work, boys.  NHL Home Ice.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, sir.  You got it.  Bye-bye.  Live from Toronto.  They do their show every morning.  Live from Toronto.  Every morning they're live in Toronto.  XM 204.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Oh, nice.  It was a pretty crazy night. 
[00:32:30]  A little of everything yesterday.  Sounds like a busy evening.  And then another story I told you that I'm not really sure I should.  I'm not sure if I should bring that to the show yet.  Oh, my God.  Roland could be the greatest guy ever.  Roland rolls.  Roland fucking rolls.  Yeah, Roland rolls.  I'll tell the story someday because that's what happens on this show.  I got to figure out what I can tell my last story.  Story pops out.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Roland's just great.  He's got a great set of balls on him. 
[00:33:00]  He was kind of doing one of your old jobs.  Yeah, yeah, true.  I did that job for a little while.  I got to shut up for now.  I'll break into the show, though.  I just got to figure out how.  One of the biggest laughs ever was last night with Roland.  Roland is the bestest.  I'll just say that for now.  Skinny Roland was what a hit.  Yeah.  Skinny Roland was.  And I guess our own Travis is really upset with Skinny Roland. 
[00:33:30]  The fact that I think he's seeing his future.  Yeah, Travis really got scared.  Well, let me just.  Yeah, scared Travis.  Let me just set it up really quickly because, you know, you get new people listening every day.  We did Most Embarrassing Tape Day yesterday with the staff.  And me and Jim are going to bring in our tapes next week as part two of this.  And Roland's tape was from 2003 when he was working on Carson Daly's late-night TV show.  And Roland was probably.  He said he was 120-something pounds. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And now I think he's a little sensitive about it, but he has gained about 100 pounds.  He's over 200 pounds now.  So to see Skinny Roland, it creeped everybody out because it's not that far.  It's not that long ago.  It's 2003.  Yeah.  That's a blink of an eye for most of us.  Very, very fast.  And we met him in 2005, by the way.  I know.  And he was still thin.  We forget.  Was he?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We have old videos of him from the XM studio, that beautiful studio we used to have. 
[00:34:30]  And he wasn't much bigger than when he looked like that for Carson Daly's TV show.  He looks like cancer, Roland.  So why is Travis bugged out?  Well, Travis is kind of seeing his own future, I think, and it's upsetting him.  Look, Roland was a skinny guy.  I'm a skinny guy.  Right.  I've put on, like, you know, 15, 20 pounds in the last, like, year and a half since my kid was born. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  So, you know.  But how old was Roland there, and how old are you now?  I'm 29.  And how old was Roland there?  Well, he was still in college, so, yeah, he was like.  See, you might have made it over what they call the hump.  You are making me feel a little better today.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, but, Travis, when did you quit smoking?  Two years ago in May.  And when did you start putting weight on?  About two years ago in May.  Yeah, no, I know that's got a lot to do. 
[00:35:30]  And, Travis, what were you eating for breakfast almost every day for months at a time, at least?  I don't know, shit.  Exactly.  Tim Hortons is a fucking, a huge black and white cookie every day.  Yeah, but I worked at Burger King for four years, and I ate Burger King three times a day.  Yeah, but you're allowed to do that when you're 16.  You can do that.  I think I ate McDonald's every day for, like, a month at a time.  But you're not even 150 pounds right now.  Yeah, I'm about 150.  He's bigger than he was.  Yeah, but I'm bigger than I was.  A little bit.  Maybe you needed to gain a few pounds.  Yeah, you were a little, you know, skinny. 
[00:36:00]  You were pretty skinny.  Buying new shirts.  Oh, oh.  Danny and I had a nice conversation.  Yes, we did.  About wearing looser shirts.  Well, see, here's the greatest thing that's happening right now.  Danny loves this, by the way.  Of course he does.  Because Travis is getting to the point where he's growing out of his mediums.  I was there, like, three years ago.  Like, I know what that feels like, and it sucks.  But I'm actually losing weight.  So I am not feeling all of the tightness that I used to be feeling in my shirts.  It's like pulling down my sleeve.  But Travis is.  So he's telling me all these things that he's experiencing with his shirts.  I'm like, yep, I know. 
[00:36:30]  I know all about it, buddy.  God, Travis.  You just nailed it.  I had to go from mediums to large.  Isn't it a sad day?  It was kind of a sad day.  You convince yourself to wear that fucking medium until you're like, dude, I look like  I have tits in a stomach.  It's retarded.  But for years, when someone said, what size are you?  You say medium.  So you keep saying it, even not thinking like, oh, well, fuck.  Yeah.  Threw all my small shirts away.  I'm a small.  Yeah, you had small.  Yeah.  I'm an L.  But I think I was supposed to be an L way before I became an L. 
[00:37:00]  Really?  Because I was trying to hang on to the M.  Hang in there.  You know you put a weight.  I was trying to hang on to the M.  When you start getting gifts and no one asked you what your size was and they just go,  oh, he's a large.  That's got to be a large.  And people out there are like, that's nothing.  I'm a triple XL.  But that's the point.  I went from M to L, which means an XL could easily happen in my near future.  Very hard to keep in the M, in that M category.  Now that I look back at some of my pictures, yeah, I should have got out of the M sooner 
[00:37:30]  than I did.  Get out of the M a little sooner.  But I refused.  You do, you do try to fit up that fucking mighty battle.  Well, the good news is I still fit in some of your clothes that you've given me over the  years.  Oh, good, good, yeah.  It's really weird to see all my old jeans worn by the staff.  I'm wearing some today, I think.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm going to have a whole bunch of new stuff coming in soon.  The thing about Travis, though, is that, you know, so he's scared about turning into,  you know, what Roland is now.  Yeah.  And he says, he goes, oh, he's like, I kind of feel, I guess, and this must be what Jimmy 
[00:38:00]  felt like when, you know, he decided to quit smoking.  That's the first thing I thought of.  When he saw that, you know, the guy with the, well, what may or may not have been mouth  cancer or whatever, and it freaked him out to the point where he actually quit.  Quit smoking that day, yeah.  So, you know, Travis is trying to relate to that and say, you know, I feel like that.  I should stop eating all this garbage and shit.  So it gives you motivation.  So, you know, Travis goes out to lunch or gets, picks up lunch to bring back.  Fifteen minutes later, he walks in, smells delicious.  What is it, everyone?  Burger King.  A fucking steakhouse sandwich and barbecue sauce and fries. 
[00:38:30]  There we go.  But just think what he would have gotten.  Yeah, probably two.  Yeah.  See?  He did cut back.  No, you're making me feel better by, you know, reminding me how old.  Oh, good.  I just totally fucked up.  He'll keep justifying all his shitty eating habits.  You know, Roland was younger.  Let him turn into a big fat pig.  How old are you?  Twenty-nine.  I'll be 30 in March.  Wow.  Once you're 32.  I swear to you, man.  The metabolism kicks down a few notches.  I swear to you, when I hit 30, I felt like metabolism changed that day.  It did.  That day.  I don't know what it is.  It's obviously psychological when you hit the big trio. 
[00:39:00]  But I started, you know, the weight would stay on.  I used to be able to eat whatever the fuck I wanted, and I never gained a pound.  But when I hit 30, it just all changed.  We'll see what happens this year.  This is the big 30 year, so.  Big 30 year.  Yeah, it'll be 30 in March.  Your metabolism sounds like in a movie when they have to cut power down by like 30% at  the power plant, and you just hear that wine go, mmm.  That's your metabolism.  And those Burger King things will stack up on you pretty quick. 
[00:39:30]  They're delicious.  Yeah, they are delicious.  Have you guys seen the BK?  I haven't had one in years.  Have you seen the BK house?  I saw that on the way home yesterday.  What the fuck is that about?  What the fuck is that?  There is a Whopper bar.  Yeah.  That's what it's called.  Is it called the BK Whopper bar?  It's the Whopper bar.  Yeah.  Or is it the BK house?  They got all sorts of good stuff.  We saw this thing for the first time walking.  I decided to walk from the garden.  I walked 50 blocks or something like that last night.  And it's Roland.  Hey, Roland.  How does Roland... 
[00:40:00]  Now, I want to know this.  All of the Travis saying the same denials I've been saying to myself for years.  Oh, is that it?  I want to know how Roland fits into some of these Springsteen shirts that you've had for years.  What?  You fit into some of these Springsteen shirts that you have had for years.  Do I know the secret?  What?  You got to go online and buy vintage and order three sizes bigger.  Oh, okay.  Rolling plans ahead.  I thought they were the original shirt.  Oh, girlfriend.  I couldn't fit in those.  I'll be like this.  No, girlfriend. 
[00:40:30]  I'll tell you.  I have re-bought some old shirts.  Have you adjusted?  Well, I really like that shirt.  I'm going to just go one.  I re-bought 15 Springsteen shirts so people won't go, hey, you still fit.  So it can't be that big.  Oh, that's true.  It's like, hey, well...  So you're wearing the same shirt.  It's like you just go to the corner and go, tear.  Tear?  Oh, God.  So you've got the...  Yeah, the trunk LTDs, you can go on.  They're more expensive, but you're like, fuck it.  Wow.  Okay.  I didn't know that.  Because I'm like, yeah, Roland's wearing these old shirts. 
[00:41:00]  And I know he's gone to Bruce.  I know he's probably bought the shirt.  And then how did it fit?  But...  Oh, no.  I thought you were thinking ahead in like a skinny little Roland in this giant shirt back in the day.  But he has to put the smaller size back in the drawer and pick out the exact same shirt and the larger size.  And no one has noticed the difference.  What do you do with your small shirts?  You can't let them sit there reminding you.  No, I just like toss them.  I give it to homeless people.  So I walk around the neighborhood.  I can see them wearing it.  It makes me laugh.  The in-shape homeless people? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Bastards.  They walk everywhere.  Yeah, they do a lot of walking.  One thing about being homeless, man.  You don't fucking have that beer bottle.  A lot of walking.  And they drink a lot of beer, too.  Seinfeld shirts.  Roland, thanks for a great experience last night at the Rangers game, man.  Were you excited to meet Ron Duguay?  No.  It was like Rocky.  He walked around the table.  And the guy, oh my God, tell me a story.  I'm like, I'm eating my shrimp.  I can't care less.  Tell me a story.  Yeah, so there I was on the ice.  Me and Roland tried to not get a picture with Ron Duguay. 
[00:42:00]  It was just awkward and weird.  He insisted.  He insisted.  And I'm like, all right.  Oh, I hate when they do that here in the studio, too.  Sometimes it's like, hey, how about a picture?  And I'm sitting here like, I didn't ask.  Right, right.  We just wanted to eat our food.  Yeah.  The four fat bankers.  Ron, Ron, who's going to win the game?  Well, boys, it's going to be a tough game.  We actually heard that.  We actually heard that.  Yeah, Ron, yeah.  Oh, man.  Ron was the cheerleader.  That's nice.  And his supermodel wife, Kim Alexis, looked pretty good, huh?  Oh, yeah.  She still looked hot, though. 
[00:42:30]  Huh?  Very attractive.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that thing?  That, my friend, is the New York Pizza Burger, available at the Whopper Bar.  It is a giant hamburger sliced up into slices like a pizza, so you can just grab a triangle  of it.  That looks fucking good.  By the way, I saw the name on the menu, so I dumped it into Google Images, and the website  that this picture is hosted on is called ThisIsWhyYou'reFat.com.  Ron, you want to split one?  One. 
[00:43:00]  We'll do two.  Please, please.  Wow.  Let me read you what's in there.  It's four Whopper patties, slices of pepperoni and mozzarella cheese with marinara sauce and  some other kind of sauce on a sesame seed bun.  What Danny just did, just talk food porn to me.  That's like porn.  Yeah, that's like you're reading porn.  Should I read you the meat beast Whopper?  Meat beast.  What is that?  Ooh, it's crispy bacon.  What a brilliant idea.  And sliced pepperoni topped with melted American cheese.  What is this now? 
[00:43:30]  It sounds delicious.  You go in and you make your own Whopper.  You can make your own or you pick from one of these.  That's crazy.  It's called the Whopper Bar.  Tons of toppings.  The first time I saw it last night, it says BK Whopper Bar.  And where is it?  It's right outside Times Square is the one we saw.  It's in the ghetto.  And what about that fucking guy?  I just told the story on the air.  The guy trying to hold back the car.  I was cheering for him to get run over. 
[00:44:00]  Dude, how close was it?  And the woman screaming like, what are you doing?  Like, it was the dumbest thing.  She didn't write down the lies in place.  She didn't call anybody.  She just screamed.  Right.  But why would you do that?  That's her job.  A little fender bender and you're getting in front of the car and the guy's like, fuck that.  I'm not stopping so we could exchange info.  Oh, you got the calorie count?  I love the calorie count.  Help me out here.  Where are we at?  Well, first up is the New York pizza burger, which is actually six servings. 
[00:44:30]  So if you manage to mount that whole thing down, that's 2,500 calories.  Oh, my God.  Look at the cholesterol count.  Oh, it's 380 milligrams of cholesterol.  Not bad.  Yeah, not bad.  Is that bad?  Almost 4,000 milligrams of sodium.  3,780 milligrams of sodium.  Is that a lot?  Yeah, yeah.  But do check out all that protein.  But, you know, they say six servings.  Come on.  Two guys could tackle that.  Yeah, yeah.  Six servings, my ass.  You're not going to have one of those little slice things and go like, oh, that's it for me. 
[00:45:00]  If they intended you to eat it that way, they'd sell it by the slice.  Yeah.  Yes.  Or if you hung over one person, right out.  One person.  Well, that's what pisses me off about ice cream and stuff.  If you go to the store and you get a pint of ice cream.  Yeah.  And you see the calories, like, whatever.  Like, oh, I can deal with that.  It says, like, let's say it's, like, a low-fat frozen yogurt or something.  It goes, ah, 200 calories.  I'm like, I can fucking eat this 200 calories.  Yeah, nice.  And then it says how many servings in the little pint. 
[00:45:30]  Six servings.  Six.  It's like, no one eats that.  No, you eat the whole thing.  When you eat ice cream, you eat the whole fucking thing.  If you're going for it.  Right.  Triple whopper.  But they fucking try to trick you with that serving shit.  A triple whopper.  How many calories?  That's just.  With or without mayo.  Gotta go mayo.  1,160.  Gotta go mayo.  1,160.  That's half.  Then with cheese, 12.  That's just about half your calories for the day.  Sodium count and everything.  And that doesn't count the french fries you would get with it. 
[00:46:00]  The soda.  Or the drink.  Yeah.  How do people not drop dead just eating this, like, right on the spot?  I've had triple whoppers before.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  It sounds like The Simpsons, where Homer was thin, eating everything.  And then you just stop and flash forward until now.  If we want to make a run, I'll buy at the Whopper bar.  You guys want to check one of these out?  Which one you want, man?  Or whatever.  I'll find out.  Find out.  Let's check out the Whopper bar.  The craziness.  You want to check out the pizza one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounds really good. 
[00:46:30]  But we'll all have a slice.  We can all have one serving.  No, we can get one serving.  Let's get a few different Whoppers.  I'm buying today.  I want to check out this Whopper bar.  They better get some spray in the bathrooms.  I fucking worked out yesterday after about a week of not, and I am in pain, and I'm not  letting that go for naught.  There's no fucking way I'm biting into one of those goddamn things.  You don't want to bite into the meat beast?  No, I'm not eating the meat beast.  Wow. 
[00:47:00]  They're just...  Yeah, of course.  Save that clip.  I'm always thinking.  At least I said I'm not.  That was cool.  I got that.  I got that.  As the years go by...  I'm eating the meat beast.  As the years go by, they're just making it harder and harder to try to eat relatively healthy.  Now they got the Whopper bar?  You know what is great, too?  Times Square, you got that stupid Mayor Bloomberg doing everything to try to keep people healthy,  the smoking thing, the sodium, the trans fats, everything. 
[00:47:30]  Yet when he sees an opportunity for a company to come into Times Square and dish out death  money, he has no problem.  Yeah.  Come on in.  Right.  Come on in.  Oh, Times Square's open for you there.  A Whopper bar.  That sounds great.  Right.  How about you look at some of the fucking stats on that food, you dummy?  Yeah, Burger King's bad enough, and now they've just, they upped the ante with the Whopper  bar.  Of course.  You're making a great fucking point.  No, he's fucking full of shit.  Why are you allowing these businesses to pop into Times Square if you care about what people 
[00:48:00]  are eating?  Asshole.  That's just like somebody smoking inside the place.  If you're ordering that fucking pizza thing and you're eating the whole thing, you might as  well be smoking in that Whopper bar and you would get thrown out or arrested or whatever  or a ticket at least.  I want to thank the casino for having a smoking area in the casino.  It was, it was terrific where all the smoke was, knew where to go.  It was just in this one area. 
[00:48:30]  One area.  In this nice, nice, it was weird.  Like the smoke didn't go anywhere else because it was a smoking area.  Smoking area.  And the smoke just knew.  Of course.  Holy shit.  I can't stand that.  It was like old school with my fucking clothes.  Really, I know.  I can't stand that smoky.  We should take our first break.  Roland, thank you.  That was a wonderful night, man.  And you are my hero.  I woke up in the middle of the night laughing.  I think I could tell the story as long as I keep the names out. 
[00:49:00]  You could do that.  The flash was on.  Yeah, might as well.  You stupid.  Should I tell the story?  I don't know if I should tell the story.  Should I tell the story?  What do you think of it?  If it's, you know.  Wow.  Let me think it over.  Oh, breakfast.  I'll get it on the air.  I got to think this one out.  But Roland, fucking.  Fuck, dude.  You make me laugh so hard.  All right.  Hey, with this production piece, Danny, as we go to break, what is it?  I don't know this one.  Oh.  Voss. 
[00:49:30]  You want to save it?  He's coming in today.  We can save it for him.  We'll play it now, then we can play it again.  All right.  This is an idea Derek had because, of course, Voss always has to get a deal, and he thought  it was time that maybe it was time for an intervention.  Oh, a little deal type of cheap guy intervention.  Oh, I get it.  I see where he's going here.  Uh-oh.  On an all-new Jewish intervention.  Why are you always looking for a deal on everything?  That's what I do, okay?  This is my friend.  Comedian and Jew, Rich Voss, is confronted about his frugal spending habits. 
[00:50:00]  You never buy yourself nice stuff.  The car's always two years old.  Nice other people shit.  There's always something going on with you.  Will this once semi-famous comedian be saved by his more famous friends?  You got to go to this new website.  Everything's on sale, like high-end shit.  See, it's always that.  That's what...  Everything about everything.  When was the last thing you actually bought something brand new and didn't go looking  for a deal?  You don't get it.  Can the aging stand-up break the stereotype that Jews really are cheap? 
[00:50:30]  There's no bartering.  There's no, I mean, maybe a little, hey, do this, do that.  You know, take a couple.  You got a dead guy's watch on it?  See this right here?  See this shit right here?  Dead guy's watch.  Or is it simply too late?  It's too fucking late for him to change.  Which is what he is.  He's going to go to a fucking garage sale.  It's not the bargain, it's the fun of a negotiating, man.  It's not the bargain.  I don't believe him.  I don't believe him.  I don't believe him.  Find out on an all-new Jewish intervention.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus. 
[00:51:00]  Virus.  Sirius XM.  We got Rich Voss coming in today.  Yes. 
[00:51:30]  And Stephen Merchant.  Very excited about Stephen Merchant.  Ricky Gervais' partner in crime, basically.  Yeah.  One of them.  They got that, um, god damn, they got that new show where they send, uh, what's his name?  Um, oh, fuck.  That little round-headed nut.  Carl.  Carl.  Yeah, they send him all over the world.  Really?  Yeah.  Fucking looks hysterical.  Where's that on?  Science Channel.  Yeah.  Carl.  So we'll talk to Stephen Merchant at nine. 
[00:52:00]  Rich Voss will be here in about an hour, half hour, something like that.  Uh, Ant, we could, uh, we could, we could stay silly, or we could get, uh, serious.  What do you want to do?  Oh, Christ.  Yeah.  I hate getting serious.  You do, right?  Yeah.  Well, you got Michael Moore.  Well, how are we spelling it?  Uh, S-I-R-O-R-A-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.  Oh, Michael Moore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Michael Moore and Rachel Maddow talking guns.  Yeah, that's great.  It's all about the guns lately.  You gotta talk about guns. 
[00:52:30]  Michael Moore is just proving he's, um, he's very accurate.  What?  I read what he said, and I'm like, well, it describes me.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Like, what am I going to do?  Well, let's play this clip then.  They can't get enough of the gun discussion on TV these days.  They love talking guns.  I'm more worried about cabs than fucking those black town cars.  I love the guns. 
[00:53:00]  Than guns.  My God, man.  Yes, and I am loathe to bring up what is in our head,  because we don't like to talk about it so much,  but on this particular day, on Martin Luther King Day,  I think this needs to be said.  That imaginary person that's going to break into your home and kill you,  who does that person look like?  It's not freckled-faced Jimmy down the street, is it, really?  Jimmy.  That's not what really people...  We never really want to talk about the racial or the class part of this 
[00:53:30]  in terms of how it's the poor or it's people of color  that we imagine we're afraid of.  Why are we afraid?  What is that?  And it's been a fear that has existed for a very, very long time.  And, you know, but I love this quote by Martin Luther King.  Somebody said to him one time,  you know, why do we need to enact a federal anti-lynching law?  You know, I mean, you can't force people to love each other.  You can't...  You know, a law isn't going to make somebody not a racist.  Right.  And he said, yeah, that's true. 
[00:54:00]  You can't legalize us getting along with each other.  But I have a feeling if we pass an anti-lynching law,  it probably is going to help.  And it did.  And we need these laws.  But we also need to address the larger issue of why are we such a violent people?  And not just personal domestic violence,  but a nation that invades other countries,  that has such a huge weapons budget,  that just seems just so intent on violence being the answer.  And I think that's the thing. 
[00:54:30]  We want to dance around here.  We're afraid of really talking about it.  If we can just focus on something else, we're going to be okay.  He is such an asshole, by the way.  But we met him.  I have to address...  But we met him.  Yeah, we met him all right.  He was nice to us.  He liked us.  Because he's a phony crock of shit, is what I saw.  He's a phony.  I can't hate anyone I've met.  I hate him.  He's a phony.  He's a phony.  He's got an image and a persona that he puts across as this, you know, 
[00:55:00]  liberal, look at me, I'm out for this little guy thing.  And then you sit and talk with him for 10 minutes,  and you realize he's a fucking, you know, he's just a showbiz guy  looking to sell his next project.  Aren't they all show busy on TV, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But he tries to come across like he's not show busy.  Like he's really, really into his causes and stuff.  It's hard to take Bill O'Reilly serious when he's yelling and screaming  and then does a plug for his fucking no spin zone coffee mug. 
[00:55:30]  Coffee mugs and everything.  And frisbees and whatever else he slaps a label on.  Everyone's hawking everywhere.  Keith Olbermann does the same shit.  But let me address something here.  Sure, sure.  Statistically, Michael Moore described what home invaders look like  and where they come from.  This imaginary person that breaks into your house,  if they're there to rob your house or unless it's a personal attack on you 
[00:56:00]  for something work-related or marriage dispute or cheating or something like that,  if a criminal is breaking into your house in a home invasion,  statistically, it's probably going to be a young black male.  That's just police investigating attempted break-in in Kings Point, Long Island.  Long Island home invasion.  It's right up on the Fox 5 screen I'm looking at right now. 
[00:56:30]  Now, give me a description, please.  Why is Long Island the capital of home invasions?  I'll tell you why.  I mean, for the people, I hope they understand, we're in Manhattan right now, okay?  To our east is Long Island.  To our west is Jersey.  And then you go north, you've got Connecticut and all that.  But when it comes to home invasions,  they never talk about home invasions in Jersey or anywhere else.  It's always Long Island.  Why?  Long Island's an easy place to do a home invasion  because you're close to major thoroughfares, 
[00:57:00]  major arteries that take you right back to the city again.  So you could rob a place, get back on the highway,  and then you're, you know, you're back on the road.  You're out of that town that you just robbed a house in,  and you're back into the city.  Wherever the fuck you come from, probably the city.  But the thought that Michael Moore sits there and says that statistics say  that the gun crime, things like this, gang-related violence, 
[00:57:30]  it's going to be minorities.  It's going to be minorities.  And when he talks about why we're such a violent country  and going to war against other nations,  that's his idea of a violent country,  is the white politician being violent  or this asshole in Arizona being the violent guy with the gun.  Hey, Michael Moore,  how about the fucking thousands of gang-related minority shootings 
[00:58:00]  that happen with illegal guns every year in this country?  Address those.  What, those people get a free pass, Michael Moore?  Because they're black or Hispanic?  Because white people are afraid of home invasions?  Of which, as I'm talking about you  and this imaginary home invasion shit,  I look up on the TV at the same time.  Swear to God.  We were just talking about it. 
[00:58:30]  I look up, and right by my home,  I'm looking at a home invasion.  So don't tell me what's imaginary.  By the way, you fat fuck.  I bet you I could talk to him live down there at the Whopper place.  I might as well just go down there.  Odds are he's down there.  Getting his breakfast.  He's a guy that does not want to look at reality.  He's got this fucking fantasy world in his head  that all this crime, all this minority crime, 
[00:59:00]  black on black crime, black on white,  Hispanic against black, black against Hispanic.  Look at the L.A. gangs just wiping each other out.  He thinks that somehow white people are all responsible for this violence.  It's whitey.  It ain't whitey.  Tell them to behave.  Make a movie called Fucking Behave.  How about you do that?  What the hell happened?  Bowling for Behave. 
[00:59:30]  Do that.  I want to see him make that movie.  Bowling for Behave.  Ah.  Fuck him.  Wow.  And Michael Moore, to add to the discussion,  he's an NRA member, isn't he?  Lifetime.  He did that to fucking be able to fuck with the NRA.  It's like easy eating going to the fucking Republican dinner.  All right.  When did he join the NRA?  Probably when he was a kid.  He said he.  I'm here in Lifetime. 
[01:00:00]  He said.  If he was a kid, he didn't know any better as a kid.  But if he joined the NRA only, I don't know, 10 years ago or so,  then it's very calculated.  I don't know when he joined the NRA.  He's in one of his movies.  It might be Bowling for Columbine.  He talks about how he had hunted as a kid and him and his dad would go out and shoot with rifles and shit like that.  What the hell was he hunting in Flint, Michigan?  Yeah, Flint, Michigan.  Yeah, go to Flint now.  And, of course, it's all because of the guy that took my car. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  That's Flint, Michigan.  And all the crime there is because of the auto industry going down and white people again, just rich white people fucking over.  Why there's so much crime.  Yeah.  How about you just behave?  How about you don't depend on whitey to fuck you over or do good for you?  How about you look around your neighborhood, realize, holy shit, there's a shitstorm going on every fucking night here with gunfire and everything else. 
[01:01:00]  And you fucking take care of your own block.  And then the other guys take care of their block.  And before you know it, you got a little neighborhood starting.  It's like a game, like Sim City.  There you go.  It's like Sim City.  Fix your shit.  I thought you wanted to stay in a good mood.  Bowling for Behave.  That's going to be the line of the day.  I'm tired of him.  We got to do line of the day again.  It's time.  With bowling, what is it? 
[01:01:30]  Bowling for Behave.  Bowling for Behave.  Just behave yourselves.  We got to bring back the line of the day officially.  Michael Moore's an asshole.  And I'll tell you one thing.  If we had him on the show, you didn't say any of this stuff to him.  Oh, if he was here right now today and he came up with that lame-ass fuck statement that everybody that owns a gun is racist and fears black, feels people of color.  That's what it is.  You fear people of color and you're racist.  How is it racist and fearing people of color when every time I see a home invasion, convenience store security cameras, people being shot, a large majority of the time it's minorities doing it. 
[01:02:00]  I'm just stating fact here.  I've looked at FBI statistics.  I've looked at them.  I've seen them.  I've seen them.  And he just wants to, he's constantly blaming Whitey.  See, he had to say, oh, it's not the freckle-faced guy.  Oh, what, the white guy?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:02:30]  Look at the alarm commercials.  He must love those.  Oh, look.  It's an accurate depiction of a white guy kicking in the door in a suburban neighborhood.  Stop already.  This Michael Moore with his lines of shit.  What's the matter?  No interest in any of your projects?  You got to come up and chime in on this Tucson situation?  Well, why don't we get him on the air?  Roland, try to get Michael Moore on the air today.  Yeah.  Get the Michael Moore.  Yeah, he might take a call from us today.  Michael Moore. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Stop it already.  No Whoppers till 1030.  More importantly.  And no more pizza burger.  Why did they get rid of that?  What the fuck is going on with our Whoppers?  I'm getting the text updates from TravDog.  TravDog went to, tell him to go to Pop-Tart World.  How stupid Pop-Tart.  Tell him to stop by Pop-Tart World and see if that place is still in business.  How's that place doing?  Worst business idea ever, Pop-Tart World.  Check it out for yourself if you ever make it to Times Square.  It's a disaster of a business model. 
[01:03:30]  They thought it was going to be like the M&M store and it ain't quite panning out, is it?  Not at all.  Tart store.  Joseph H. from Charlotte.  Did Jay Moore really say this?  Per Jay Moore, he writes.  Rachel Maddow is Fred Savage all grown up.  That's pretty good.  What was Rachel Maddow saying?  Anything?  Did she chime in?  Not really.  Everyone that owns a gun, as Michael Moore says, is racist and has a fear of people of color. 
[01:04:00]  Let me go to Justin in Tampa.  He wants to argue with you a little bit.  All right, Justin.  We're not going to make a thing out of this.  We're going to move on to other material.  But, Justin, you got through in the nick of time.  Go.  All right.  How much of this, and I know you say you read the FBI statistics, but how much of this is the media covering the black guy that's the home invader?  And then on the opposite end of the spectrum, you know, there's a story about this 19-year-old black girl who comes home from college, goes to visit some friends in Baltimore, and disappears. 
[01:04:30]  And, you know, the mayor or the police chief of Baltimore says, this is our Natalie Holloway, but it's a black girl.  No one's covering it.  If it was a little white girl, it would be all over the news.  So how much does the media play a role in this?  Well, you're talking about two different things.  As far as abductions go, the media will always concentrate a lot more on the little blonde-haired white girl than they will the black girl. 
[01:05:00]  Don't know.  Don't know why.  That's just the way it is.  I've never seen a program stopped for a special report because a black girl is missing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I guess if you watch TV, you've got to assume that black girls are never abducted.  Never abducted.  Right.  It just never happens, I guess.  They're not going to stop your American Idol to tell you that some girl went missing, some black girl went missing.  But if she has blonde hair and blue eyes, boy, man. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  You're not going to be watching American Idol for a while.  It's, dude, it also has to do with demographics.  And the news wants to tug on the old heartstrings of the most people they can.  And when you're talking 10%, 11% of the population being black, I think the news sees that as like, well, how many people are really going to be interested?  But if we put a little, you know, blonde JonBenet looking thing on there, we're going to really get a lot of viewers. 
[01:06:00]  Now, that's totally different than black crime because that could be looked at with statistics, with arrest records, with you could.  It's something that could actually be looked at.  And it's very rare.  I would love to watch First 48 and see a fuckload of white people killing other white people on that show and have investigators find out that, you know, it's a couple of white guys and they killed a white guy. 
[01:06:30]  It's constantly black on black murders on First 48.  Very rarely you'll see white people.  You'll see Hispanics.  But for the most part, it's amazing how many black people are killing each other out there.  So, Anthony, Anthony, then, is it so can we agree that it's a lot of how do we scare white people in the media?  No, it's white people by showing little white girls being abducted. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not talking about white girls being abducted.  That's not my point.  I'm never making that point.  I agree with that.  What I'm saying is crime.  I'm talking gun crime here.  Let's talk gun crime.  We're talking about a lot of a disproportionate number of minorities committing gun crimes.  I agree with that.  All right.  At the same time, it's when white people get angry at each other, we don't shoot each other.  We sue each other. 
[01:07:30]  It's just a totally different thing.  So you called up to argue, yet you're agreeing with me?  No, no, no, no.  What I'm saying is my argument was how much of it is the media just wanting to show what they want to show  and wanting to show things that scare the people watching.  Now you're arguing apples and eggplants.  I don't want to sit here and argue that.  Boo.  All right, boys.  You'll have a good day.  All right.  See, he got scared.  He ran away.  He did run away.  So bowling for what? 
[01:08:00]  Bowling for behave.  Bowling for behave.  Bowling for behave.  I'm trying to think if we could rework some other black movies with the word behave.  I'm sick of him.  I'm smelling a bit today.  I'm sick of Michael Moore.  Are you?  Is he really hurting anybody?  Yes.  He's spreading his dumb ass shit liberal bullshit propaganda and that dumb ass no ratings channel  with Rachel Manow.  Rachel Manow.  No. 
[01:08:30]  Isn't that funny?  No.  They cleaned her up and made her look like a girl before they gave her a TV show.  A girl?  Have you seen the pictures of her before they decided to put her on TV?  Yeah, but the one in the afters.  They softened her up.  Yeah, well.  She still looks like a guy.  And then Travis before she was doing TV.  Looks like a guy.  Find pictures of what she used to look like before they had to make her sort of look feminine  for MSNBC.  She looks like a man.  That's why I said sort of.  This is what she used to look like.  Oh, crap. 
[01:09:00]  You would say that's a guy.  Yeah, I would say that was a gay man.  She looks like B.J. Novak.  B.J. Novak.  From The Office, anybody?  But she used to look exactly like a college boy.  Yeah, yeah.  She looks like some kind of a gay college boy.  And MSNBC's like, look, man, if you want a TV show, we're going to have to make you  look like a feminine.  We're going to have to make you look like a woman, I should say.  Sorry.  So they softened her up.  She doesn't want to fucking look like that.  She wants to look like a boy.  Badly.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Badly she wants to look like a boy.  Oh, wow.  Very good observation, Danny.  Yeah, kind of looks like him.  Yep.  Trying to look for one.  B.J. Novak a little bit.  B.J. in glasses.  Yeah, put him in glasses, and it looks like Rachel.  Wow.  Rachel Meadow.  Yeah, I'm just tired of Michael Moore and his fucking bullshit.  Michael Moore's.  Michael Moore's.  Michael Moore's.  Paul Stanley, 59 today.  Wow.  Dude, your favorite.  Bill Maher.  Did you send him a birthday card?  Oh, Bill Maher.  55 years old today. 
[01:10:00]  Why don't Bill Maher and Michael Moore sit there and just suck each other's cocks?  They could sit there and just suck each other's liberal cocks.  Big fatty.  Let's see fucking, fucking, Bill Maher has to lift up Michael Moore's big belly fat and  just, and just jack his dick off into his own fucking Bill Maher mouth.  Danny, you got to tweet that. 
[01:10:30]  That's very good.  Separated.  That is good, man.  Wow.  Also, Maddow, before they made her look like a girl, and B.J., B.J. Novak from the American  office.  From the American office.  Huh?  She still looks like a boy.  Yeah, but they had to soften her.  Also, this just in from Travis.  He sent me a picture.  Come on.  Of the Pop-Tart store.  No one's in it, right?  It's empty and torn down.  Done.  Wait, is it done?  It looks like it.  I see boxes inside.  It's done already.  It looks all packed up.  Did we say that this was not going to last? 
[01:11:00]  No.  When are people going to understand we are truly seers?  We see everything before it happens.  It's like the Scotch Tape store.  When that Pop-Tart world hit Times Square, we went on the radio and said, this fucking  thing is never going to last.  No.  How many months was that?  I got to look.  I would guess it was like in the spring.  Maybe it lasted six months.  Maybe.  But it's already gone.  It was supposed to be a temporary store, though.  Really?  Yeah.  It says here from August through December. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, really?  Is that what they're saying?  The Pop-Tart brand popped up.  It's a very own temporary store on Times Square.  They're trying to save face.  Yeah.  They were feeling it out.  Times Square is a prime location.  They put a store like that in there, and they see what happens.  Yeah.  And if they were doing a lot of business, they would have kept the fucking store running.  So that's bullshit.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  This is sort of what I'm going for.  We got a bit. 
[01:12:00]  We got a bit.  Adam in Michigan.  Adam.  Good morning, fellas.  What's up, Adam?  I want the boys to behave in the hood.  Oh, behave in the hood.  Behave in the hood.  Nah.  No?  Yeah.  Well, you don't like the bit?  I think it's accurate.  It's a bit.  Phone bit.  It's a bit.  Behave.  That's all.  Oh, this guy's very concerned for you.  Yeah.  Oh, Afro Nerd.  I know Afro Nerd.  All righty.  Afro Nerd.  It's been a while.  Yes.  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  And I like it that way, by the way. 
[01:12:30]  Not too bad.  Listen.  Or what you have to say.  Yes.  Go ahead, Afro Nerd.  Okay.  I tell you how I feel.  I'm the first guy that says that we need to have some kind of martial law in some of these areas that are affected.  Camden cut half their police force.  I mean, it's going to be anarchy over there.  More anarchy than we've ever known.  Brilliant idea.  But, Anthony, you're acting as if there's no such thing as lower-tier white people.  What?  Yacht-Bank. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, Yacht-Bank.  Oh, Yacht-Bank, whatever.  Or, Calm, Riverhead.  There are pockets of meth labs.  You have all kinds of, quote-unquote, trashy Caucasian people getting it in, as they say, just like lower-tier black people.  I tell you, I use the word deracializing.  You're not sticking to it.  We're talking about a class thing.  We're not talking about just...  No, no, no.  We're not just...  Don't try to lump it into a class thing, because here's what the deal is also.  Uh, I've talked about white trash so much. 
[01:13:30]  I love white trash.  When we watch Hoarders, I can just sit there and look at this hillbilly shit white trash sitting in their own crap with 8,000 cats.  I know what lower-class white trash is.  I've seen it.  I've lived amongst it.  I know it.  Believe me.  What I'm talking about is violent crime.  Violent crime. 
[01:14:00]  Because that's what Michael Moore was saying.  Violence in America.  Violent crime.  It's very disproportionate, white to black.  Very disproportionate.  Yeah, I'm not going to disagree with you with the disproportionate nature of crime.  But sure, you're acting as if we can't...  Blacks cannot be the end-all and be-all of crime if we're only, what, 10 or 12% of the population.  But amazingly enough, it's 50% at least of the prison population?  Wow.  So it can't be the end-all, be-all? 
[01:14:30]  It would sure...  If there wasn't any black crime, it sure the fuck would cut down on crime, wouldn't you say?  There's different types of crime.  Bernie Madoff was one man...  Exactly.  ...and responsible for...  Violent crime is what Michael Moore was talking about.  This violence in America.  Handgun violence.  Gun violence.  Killing.  Murders with guns.  Violence, violence, violence.  I'm not talking about white-collar crime.  You want to start a conversation on that? 
[01:15:00]  We'll talk about that.  But I'm talking about violent crime.  Stick to the subject.  Let's be honest.  Yeah?  You know, when you're dealing with this type of crime, unfortunately, it is race-specific with the victim and the victimizer, right?  So, what you're feeling to realize is that this type of crime is not really affecting you.  Oh, you don't think black-on-white crime is big also?  Let me tell you something. 
[01:15:30]  I've looked at the stats.  Look at the stats again.  Black-on-black crime is gigantic.  Black-on-white crime is huge.  White-on-black crime...  Oh, look!  Look at how that stat drops down.  Listen.  Wait, wait, wait.  For you personally, this is like Sally Struthers and flies around the heads of poor kids in Africa.  Yeah.  To you.  In other words...  Why is that?  You just don't like it because it makes you feel uncomfortable.  So it can't happen to me?  What are you guaranteeing as a black person?  You're now guaranteeing my safety.  Is that what you're doing? 
[01:16:00]  I can't guarantee my safety.  Well, why not?  You say it shouldn't involve me or concern me.  That I walk down certain streets or I'm in certain areas where I have to be more concerned about my safety than other areas.  Right now, you have to be concerned.  Can I get a PBA card?  Can I get a PBA card from the black community that will get me out of trouble if I go to get accosted in some way, shape, or form?  Listen, right now, you need to be concerned with the thin white male in the farm with the... 
[01:16:30]  All right, because let me tell you something, because that's just running rampant.  That runs rampant.  Crimes like we saw in Tucson.  Oh, my God.  Every day you hear about that shit going on.  Would you stop it?  You and the fucking news should stop it.  Start fucking telling us the racial background of every fucking shooting they report on television.  Could you please do that news?  Could you please say young black male? 
[01:17:00]  We're looking for a young black male in connection with a shooting instead of only when it happens in Tucson.  A thin white guy with a gun, with an assault gun.  How about be honest?  And let's hear what the real fucking stats are instead of hiding, hiding behind liberal bullshit and political correctness.  Listen, I'm the first to tell you, like I said, I'm the first to admit about this emotional crime.  I'm not making excuses.  But at the same time, you're not admitting that the media has a role in this because they do not want to tell you the truth. 
[01:17:30]  They're still force-feeding us, force-feeding us liberalism.  They don't want to tell us the truth about how come when they say, all right, there was a rape in, let's say, a predominantly black neighborhood.  And they say there's a rapist running around raping women.  He's described as a male, six feet tall.  He was wearing a blue hoodie.  How about you say he's a black male?  And then we could cut out fucking 90% of the population if we're looking for this guy. 
[01:18:00]  But they don't fucking say that.  Why?  Listen.  If the news is, why?  No, because the news is a business.  That's why.  Well, if they're trying to, but you're trying to have it both ways.  If they're trying to scare us and make the black person so scary to white people, why wouldn't they report every crime and tell us the race? 
[01:18:30]  Listen, I think the print media does that.  You see a black or brown face on the print media.  Meh, meh.  Maybe if they show a picture.  I never see in the written description.  Never see in the written description black.  They've taken it out of descriptions of criminals in the newspaper and on the fucking news.  It's amazing.  Listen, I see some of that, but not wholeheartedly.  You know what?  I look.  I see my fair share of faces, Anthony.  I look.  So I'm looking like you're looking.  All right.  But at the same time, you're not admitting the media. 
[01:19:00]  Very slanted.  You're not going to get accuracy.  When the gentleman called up before, you were very skirtish with him.  But he was telling you, what he was saying to you, was that the media has, listen, if a girl has gone missing, who cares what the race is?  It's a story.  It's newsworthy.  It shouldn't have an element of demographics.  Demographics is a red herring.  Well, then let's throw the news out of it completely and go to what I was talking about before, the statistics, crime statistics. 
[01:19:30]  Let's go to that instead of the news.  Fuck the news.  They're a business.  They're in it for the money.  They're not going to report certain things accurately.  Fine.  I'll even say, all right, how about statistically a disproportionate number of violence in the black community that's not addressed?  It's blamed on white people by liberals like Michael Moore.  Well, listen, you're not going to have a guy.  There's enough conservative black people and brown people, different points of view, that the media does not want to hear from. 
[01:20:00]  So you're making it seem as if African-Americans are not coming out on a certain angle on this.  They don't want to hear from me.  They'd rather hear from something or the usual cast of characters.  They choose who they want to take a position on this stuff.  So you just give up because the news isn't paying attention?  How about what I said before, taking care of your block, taking care of your neighborhoods, taking care of crime and children, fathering children, and not fathering fucking 10 kids and not paying attention to any of them and perpetuating this thing. 
[01:20:30]  White people are doing that to black people.  Really?  Really?  Did I say no?  No.  No.  Michael Moore will.  That's what he says.  How about looking at how this country operates and assimilating to it and using it to your advantage, and I'm talking about to anybody out there, and making the best out of it, making the best out of where you live, and not fucking shit up. 
[01:21:00]  Listen, I told you time and time again, there is a position, there is a business that throws a certain image, a certain viewpoint, an alleged black viewpoint, instead of a multifaceted,  black viewpoint, the news doesn't want to hear that.  We're not going to hear from people who think differently, where a certain type of thought process could permeate throughout the black community.  We're being sold a defeatist culture.  Sold a defeatist culture? 
[01:21:30]  Look at, you're not, you as a people are not smart enough to say, wow, why don't we pull ourselves up?  Then what are you saying?  You're playing a blame game.  You're blaming again.  I'm blaming?  You're being sold by who?  I'm saying this every day.  I'm saying this every day.  People are sheep.  They're stupid.  They're biopics they don't need.  We're dummies.  Are you stupid enough to realize that killing each other and fathering a ridiculous amount of children with different women isn't good for the community and your people? 
[01:22:00]  Do you understand that?  I talk about it every day.  All right.  Well, if I have my own radio show on the internet, you know, listen, they're not going to call out me.  They don't want to hear my viewpoint.  It's not the black people.  Well, keep it up then.  Well, keep it up and see how many people come around.  I'm sending something to Scott Greenstein right now.  Let's see what happens.  Boo!  Well, how do we find your radio show there, Afro Nerd? 
[01:22:30]  I want to give someone else a chance here.  Give a plug.  They'll hear something different.  AfroNerdRadio.com.  All right.  Very good, sir.  Thank you.  I'll check that out.  Always a pleasure when you call the show.  All right?  I'll check that out after I go to the other website.  Let me go to Gary.  A couple more, and then we've got to take a break.  Gary.  Gary.  What's up?  It says angry black guy.  All right.  No, no, no.  I'm not angry, but, I mean, AfroNerd has to a degree a valid point, but you're beating 
[01:23:00]  a dead horse, man.  Why?  I mean, every nigga you get on the program is going to, they're going to take it somewhere  where they don't need to go.  They don't seem to understand it's like a mental block when you say violent crime.  Yeah.  They take it someplace else, and you'll get this with every black caller that you get.  I come from Southside, Jamaica, Queens.  Mm-hmm.  No matter how many niggas you get on the phone, they're always going to go.  If you get Patrice on the phone to argue with you right now, he's going to go someplace 
[01:23:30]  else.  That other dickhead they call talking about child abductions.  You was talking nothing about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Sticking to one subject at a time, yeah.  Yeah, and they got to see, black people got a hard time understanding that.  They really do.  I mean, it's not about self-hatred with me, but, you know, I understand your frustration.  It's like talking to kids.  You tell them one thing, and then they go someplace else, and then you look at them like, what  the fuck are you talking about?  That's basically what you just went through.  That whole conversation with Apple Nerd was basically based on that. 
[01:24:00]  He's telling you he agrees with you, but yet he called up.  And how much time of yours did he waste?  I just fucking wasted all that time listening to that.  Actually, I'm going to have to listen to it later in the replay, because I left the studio.  I just played a tape of me from last week.  All right.  I really heard that he wasn't making that much sense.  Yeah.  All right, Gary.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Let me go to Scotty in Virginia.  Scotty.  Yes.  Hello. 
[01:24:30]  Hello, Scotty.  Turn down your radio, Scotty.  You're live.  We got a little delay.  Turn it down.  Turn it down.  Hey, now, some of what you're saying, I agree with, but you got to take, Caucasians have  to take their blame and their role in what's going on in the African-American community.  And how's that?  Number one, hold on, let me say this.  Okay, go ahead.  Number one, we don't produce anything.  A lot of the crime is drug-related crimes, right?  We don't produce any drugs, right?  We are consumers of drugs, and your separation goes all the way back to slavery, right? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  So you have, and the economy.  We don't control the economy.  White people fucked up the economy, not us.  So when there's, when there has to be a means to still make it.  You're blaming.  You're playing the blame game.  How about, so that makes, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me ask you, let me ask  you a quick question now.  So you're saying that because white people run the economy, and white people, apparently, 
[01:25:30]  I think what you were saying is that white people are bringing the drugs into the community  because you don't produce them, you're just consuming them.  So that makes you fuck 10 different women and have 10 different kids with them.  How is that, how does that link together?  Hold on, hold on.  So you're saying only, only blacks father are numbers, numbers of kids?  No, I've seen white trash do it time and time again.  Not just white trash.  Come on, man. 
[01:26:00]  What are you talking about?  Yeah, I've seen white trash father amazing amounts of kids.  I have one child.  Yeah, okay.  And in our community, you hear about the crimes, but I know in my community, most of the people  in my community work.  There are some assholes that do the shootings.  It's not that, well, I can't say it's not that.  I'm not saying it's everybody, and I would never say it's everybody.  I'm saying there's a grave disproportionate number, and nobody's addressing that. 
[01:26:30]  It's playing the blame game.  It's people like Michael Moore addressing violence and then blaming it on a white guy  when the fact is there's a disproportionate number of gun violence in the black community.  Where do the guns come from?  Oh, stop.  You can't stop.  You know something?  Hey, how about we just, you know what we're going to do?  We're going to fly over the inner cities with flyers, with flyers that say every black person 
[01:27:00]  get on a bridge and jump off, and I guess you'll all be gone because all your white people  will lay out the flyers, and that'll happen.  How about you realize right from wrong, and I was, I let you talk.  I'm addressing what you said.  Oh, go ahead.  I'm not coming up with new points.  I'm addressing now what you said.  If you want to say that, you trace it back, where do the guns come from?  The white people, what?  They're being sold to each other.  They're trickling down.  At some point, you've got to say, wow, maybe I shouldn't buy this illegal gun. 
[01:27:30]  I agree with that.  Now, how many mass killers have we heard about in the media?  How many of them have been black?  That's a white crime, my friend.  I agree with you.  That is a, if you profile, again, profile them.  I agree with you.  I agree with you that we need to hold each other accountable in our community.  I'll be number one to say that.  Yeah.  Because it's become acceptable, and it shouldn't be acceptable. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  But.  That's a good start.  White folks have to take their blame and the role that they have played in why shit is the way it's been.  White people, especially liberal whites.  Liberal whites have been.  Yeah.  Okay.  They've been taking the blame for years.  Throughout history.  Yeah.  Who has been the most violent race of people in history?  In history?  I would say sub-Saharan black people have been the most violent people in history. 
[01:28:30]  Sub-Saharan black Africans have been of the most violent people on the face of the earth, I'll say, from what I've read.  White Europeans.  Violent as mother.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  White Europeans have been some violent motherfuckers.  I understand this.  But hand in hand with the violence went production, invention, innovation, amazing things. 
[01:29:00]  Sub-Saharan Africa is a wasteland of genocide and death that is is nothing's being done about it from the people on the inside.  It takes outside help from the world and it's still all fucked up.  And then the violence you're talking about Rwanda, motherfuckers, Somalia.  All these places are just shitholes of warlords, black on blacks, killing each other because of tribal reasons. 
[01:29:30]  It's been violent for for millennia.  We're talking about.  All right.  That's a good point.  We're talking about inner city violence.  Mm hmm.  Right.  That again is in gangs and the black community is running rampant in gangs.  Which you're you're saying that. 
[01:30:00]  It's only caused by.  Minority.  Nope.  Never said that.  There are plenty of fucking skinheads, white supremacist gangs, militias that are just as violent, evil and fucking hateful.  I'm never I'm never I'm never saying everybody.  I'm saying usually I'm talking about disproportionate numbers, percentages.  You made a comment.  You made a comment earlier about the the percentages of blacks in prison. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Right.  And you got to hold up to this, that the justice system is not fair.  They got nigger law.  Two.  Yeah.  They got nigger law.  What the hell is that?  I've never seen that many law books I have read.  But who are you carpooling with?  Who are you carpooling with?  Now, now, the legal system has always been held up as an example of racist.  And that's the reason that so many blacks are in jail.  It absolutely is. 
[01:31:00]  If you if if a white person comes into the inner city and is in his attack.  Right.  Right.  By African-American.  Right.  African-American will probably get 20 years.  I don't know.  Won't be a hate crime.  I'll tell you that much.  If if if if a if a black guy hurts another black guy, then one to five, it just goes one  to five. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  One to five.  He's got the numbers.  One to five.  Hey, why is that?  Why is that?  All right.  What about a white guy beating up on a black guy or a couple of white guys beating up on  a black guy?  They go to prison.  They get the kind of time.  What?  Talk about.  Hey, what's the guy's name?  Fucking in Brooklyn.  That motherfucker beat up with a baseball bat, a couple of black guys that were robbing  cars and he's still in fucking prison.  This is years ago because it's a hate crime.  Whenever white guys beat up a black guy, it's called a hate crime. 
[01:32:00]  Talking about fat Nick.  Fat Nick.  What's the proportion to that?  It's very it's very rare.  No, dude, I'm saying honestly, you're right.  It's very rare.  And that tells another story.  Why is that so rare?  Yet when black guys assault white people, which I saw at Mardi Gras, you see it on  you pop up YouTube.  You can watch 8000 videos of black people beating the fuck out of white people in gangs.  That blindside black move, by the way, I love it.  That one where you just come up behind to the side of someone and clock them in the side 
[01:32:30]  of the head.  I've seen that so many times on you.  And you know what?  Guess guess who that happened to once?  Danny Ross.  Guess who?  Guess who did it to me?  A black guy.  Yes.  There's just a disproportionate number.  I don't have the answer, dude.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want Michael Moore telling me that this shit ain't  happening.  That's the thing that pisses me off the most.  But you what you're getting back what you've been dishing out for years.  No, what?  A black president?  Why?  Are we getting that back?  I think things have come. 
[01:33:00]  I think things have come a long fucking way from the times where black people can blame  white people.  Yeah.  But black guy sells crack cocaine.  Right.  Right.  And a white guy sells a kilo of cocaine.  A black guy gets 20 years.  The white guy is selling the kilo.  Five years probation.  I love the carpooler.  I love Johnny Cochran in the background.  I love the carpooler. 
[01:33:30]  Ask me what a white guy gets for the same crime.  Ask me what a white guy gets for the same crime.  What does a white guy get for the same crime?  I don't know.  Yeah.  How about we don't know?  Why is that?  Why is that?  It's probably more of a money issue, a class issue as far as the legal system goes.  A lot of poor black people can't afford good lawyers, things like that.  Look, you look at some fucking black athletes that have been in trouble.  They don't fucking go to jail for that many years.  It's a matter of money. 
[01:34:00]  You know what?  What?  You know what?  When the white athletes get in trouble, you'll probably never hear about it.  Uh, Brett Favre.  Brett Favre's in a bit of trouble.  He just shows his dick.  That's what he say.  Let McNabb stand.  You know why?  White athletes aren't going into bars with guns in their fucking waistband.  Come on.  You don't hear about it.  Well, don't shoot yourself in the leg, motherfucker.  Get a holster.  Jesus Christ.  You're a rich fucker.  Plexigone, you got some money. 
[01:34:30]  Buy a holster, bitch.  All right.  Now we're all getting along.  All right, bro.  I think we're going to have to just agree to live in different neighborhoods.  Hey, Scotty.  Well, listen.  I'll say this to you.  Yeah.  Don't lump us all in that group.  I really don't.  Honestly.  As us being, wait, sir, sir, sir.  As us being violent.  Wait, wait, Scotty.  Scotty, I don't.  I really don't.  Scotty, where are you off to right now?  Are you going to work?  No, actually, I'm going home. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, shit.  Actually, I'm going home.  How was the take tonight?  I've never shot anybody.  All right.  I don't have any felonies.  I take care of my kid.  Scotty, where were you, though, tonight?  Excuse me?  Where were you that you're coming home?  He asked me, where was I that I was coming home?  That's Opie.  I was coming from West Virginia.  Oh, okay.  We're just trying to get to know what type of person you are.  Like, what were you doing?  Okay, well. 
[01:35:30]  And why aren't you going to work?  It's 8 o'clock in the morning.  And you never shot anyone?  I don't have any felonies.  And I've been arrested.  And I've stayed in jail for two days.  So all of us...  What was the charge?  What you make us out to be.  What was the charge?  It was possession.  Of course.  I hear you.  And I'll tell you something else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're...  Well, I don't say if you're black.  But being black... 
[01:36:00]  No matter of fact, I'm going to go you one better.  Being white and being poor in this country...  Ain't no excuse for that shit.  Ain't no excuse for that shit.  Really?  Ain't no excuse for that shit.  Wait, why?  Why?  You had too many advantages.  Wait, wait, wait.  Where were you before you got on this damn radio?  I was poor white trash, motherfucker.  I was working as a sheet metal installer.  And I was dirt poor.  I was constantly on the verge of getting kicked out of my place. 
[01:36:30]  But I never...  Again, never killed anybody.  Never raped or robbed or anything.  But what I'm saying...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because now...  White people...  There's all kinds of...  Intelligent, motivated black person  that goes to school and early in school,  elementary school, high school,  if they do well,  do you know the golden fucking platter  they are handed in life?  They are looking...  They're yearning  for an intelligent, 
[01:37:00]  motivated black person  to give scholarships to,  to fucking send to Harvard.  It's a given.  If you fucking motivate yourself,  you will be picked up  and whisked away  to the best schools  through affirmative action,  the best jobs.  Who are you telling that shit to?  Anyone.  And motivated.  Man, they wouldn't give a nigga financial aid.  What are you talking about?  They certainly will  if you earn it in school, 
[01:37:30]  if you get good grades.  They give you extra  just for being black.  Right.  Not really.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Man, y'all motherfucking tripping.  It's affirmative action.  We're tripping.  I love it.  I don't think I'm tripping, sir.  What about...  What about...  What about...  I love Park.  African Americans  trying to get loans.  Well, you need...  How about...  How about...  All right.  Have a credit rating  and have a fucking  bank account and a job.  You know that this shit 
[01:38:00]  is not equal  and it ain't fair  and it ain't never been fair,  but I'm not...  I'm not gonna blame Whitey.  Talk to me in 1990.  I wasn't getting a fucking loan.  I'm not gonna blame...  I'm not gonna blame  the white race  for anything  that I've done  or that's happened to me  because I'm in control  of my own destiny.  Very good.  But shit is uneven  and it's always been uneven.  Well, even it... 
[01:38:30]  Well, then you  even it the fuck up.  You know what?  I want to quote  the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Uh, you know something?  Let's not judge a man  by the color of his skin,  but the content  of his character.  Do you think people  are being judged  by the color of their skin  or the content  of their character?  Both.  Eh.  These days,  I really think  it's content of character.  And I think if  Dr. Martin Luther King  saw a lot of  what was going on today  with the content  of character 
[01:39:00]  of a lot of minorities,  he would be  gravely disappointed.  With the opportunities  that are out there  that he...  Wait a minute.  With the opportunities  that he was out there  that he never got to see  that are out there now  for the black community,  he would be  gravely disappointed  in how black people  are wasting their lives  by perpetuating poverty,  by perpetuating  fatherless children,  crime in their own communities,  and not taking the advantages 
[01:39:30]  and opportunities  in this country  and building themselves up  and starting one piece  at a time  until you're a power base  to be reckoned with  in this country.  Look, you made a good point.  Of course.  You made a good point,  but you've got to go back  to the root.  Oh, I love the movie,  but let's not go back there.  No, not the movie.  You know I play it backwards.  Why are we letting him  off the hook?  I want to know  where he's coming from.  I know.  Because he's not going to work.  He's not going to work 
[01:40:00]  on a Thursday morning.  You have to take blame  for how we cut out.  No, we don't.  We really don't.  I'm not taking any blame  for black people  doing anything.  I'm not taking blame.  I wasn't around.  My fucking family  was probably pulling  a burrow in Sicily  when slavery was going on here.  I ain't taking  no fucking blame.  But the effects of it  are still lasting.  The Moors?  It was detrimental  and it still is. 
[01:40:30]  That shit,  no,  don't take your ass  but due to that alone  is a very big reason  why shit is the way it is  from separation.  Getting us to hate each other.  Teaching us how to hate each other  which out of fear.  Are you intelligent enough?  You're intelligent enough  to realize that.  Then you're intelligent enough  to break the cycle  and go,  hey,  these guys are trying  to get some shit over on us.  How about we fucking build? 
[01:41:00]  How about we build up?  You're going to sound like  all black people  don't do nothing  but kill each other.  No, I'm not.  I never said that.  I'm not saying.  I said a disproportionate number.  I'm saying there's enough  people out there  in the black community  that are trying  to do something  but they're met  with a brick fucking wall  by the black community.  How about,  like I said,  fucking block projects  that aren't interrupted 
[01:41:30]  because drug dealers  kill the people  that are trying  to make their block better  because they're coming  into their fucking business.  How about...  Why won't the government  legalize drugs?  I don't know.  They should.  Wouldn't that...  Absolutely.  Wouldn't that eliminate  a hell of a lot  of unnecessary violence?  I don't know  because it seems to me  like this whole gang...  Who's in control of that?  Who's in control  of that decision?  So you have to take...  White...  Whitey has to take...  Let me not say that. 
[01:42:00]  Let me not say that.  Whitey.  I like being called Whitey.  No, I don't mind.  But...  But...  But...  You have...  They have to take blame  because they are in control.  Well, as long as  we're perceived...  As long as white people  are perceived in control,  then black people  have an excuse.  How about you are...  The president's  at least half black.  All right?  We're getting there.  How about you just  make your own power base  and not based in violence 
[01:42:30]  or militant organizations?  How about a power base  of business  and small business  that can open up  and you...  Like white people did  with Harlem,  for Christ's sake.  How about some black people  do that?  Where did they come from?  I don't fucking know,  but they came from somewhere.  How about...  How about your...  President Bush  went over to another country  and started a damn war?  Yeah, all right.  Because...  Well...  Oops.  I didn't agree with that.  I don't agree with that. 
[01:43:00]  He wanted to be in people's pockets.  Well, I don't know  if it was all about it.  He created a war  that's still going on.  I think it was more personal.  I think it was more personal  than business,  to tell you the truth.  I think it was more personal.  I think he just didn't  like the guy.  And he tried to kill his daddy.  This country is on a downward spiral  because of greed.  Well, Bush has been out  for two years.  The black country is in control.  All right.  Well, Obama's in control  of the country,  motherfucker.  Come on.  He's the president.  You think he's in control 
[01:43:30]  of this country?  Oh, now we can't even...  Now we can't even say...  Wait, Carpooler had something to say.  What does Carpooler say?  He has a title  and you know that.  You know that  because everything  he tries to do...  But Bush didn't.  ...is blocked  and it's stopped.  Well, we can say  Bush had a title  and other people  were pulling the strings.  So don't blame him.  I'm saying that Bush  went over to another country  and started a war.  Yeah, we agree with that.  I don't think it was  a good idea  to tell you the truth. 
[01:44:00]  Since we're talking  about violence,  how many people died?  No black person  created that.  War violence  is much different  than civilian violence.  Yeah, that's a whitey thing.  We're not talking  about war violence.  It's kind of a whitey thing.  You're right.  Come on.  We're talking about...  Let's talk about  civilian violence  in the country  that we have to worry about.  I don't...  You know, I'm not...  So you went to Rwanda?  Well, yeah,  because you asked me  who the most violent  people were in the world.  In history. 
[01:44:30]  It has a world  in history, right.  Absolutely.  And I say sub-Saharan Africa  is full of violence.  How many people died...  There's not one  prosperous fucking nation there.  How many people  died during the Holocaust?  How many people  died during slavery?  Oh, millions.  Millions.  Okay.  And who did the killing?  Well, I guess,  you know, Europeans.  Who did the killing?  Black people  that sold out  their own black people  as slaves.  There's still slavery  going on in sub-Saharan Africa  with other black people 
[01:45:00]  using slaves.  There's rampant rape  going on.  When there's wars  down there...  Surprise, sir.  ...apparently,  they rape the women  to, like,  make more of them.  It's just fucking  ridiculous what goes on  in sub-Saharan Africa.  It's crazy.  And it's a place  of just wonderful resources  and beauty,  yet the people there  just treat it like shit.  And how about,  you know,  just come up with a rule.  I don't know.  Oh, absolutely,  there are resources there,  but evidently...  Oh, my God.  There's plenty of resources. 
[01:45:30]  And if there's not,  you make it work.  I'm scared to hang up  on this guy.  That's why he's gone.  Nah, he's a gnawer.  He's good.  You know what?  I like Scotty.  He's got balls.  He just fucking talks  from his heart.  Where do you work?  And he's got a homie next time.  Where do you work, Scotty?  I'm disabled.  All right.  What happened?  All right.  What happened?  He never shot anybody,  but he was...  He's laughing.  Scotty.  No, but I've been shot.  Yeah, there you go. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, shit, Scotty.  You and Carpoolers  should do a morning show.  Scotty and the Carpooler.  All right, Scotty.  Listen to Carpoolers,  my favorite guy of all time.  Take it easy, guys.  Have a nice day.  All right, Scotty.  Later, man.  Eric was saying  that he sounds like  it was like the Miller guy.  Oops, that's okay.  It all went down here.  All right, we got to take a break.  That's a terrific discussion.  That was fun.  I haven't heard that discussion  yet on the show.  It's amazing.  Fucking amazing.  Race is a giant discussion  in the world. 
[01:46:30]  It certainly is, man.  It certainly is.  And there isn't enough,  as Scotty said,  not enough whitey,  as he called me,  whitey.  I like that.  I wanted to hear Carpooler more.  I know.  He was like,  yo, what up?  Preach in the background.  You know how you have your stats?  Well, he has his stats.  That is one to five.  Scotty, next time we want to hear Carpooler.  And call up his Carpooler.  Yeah, I like that guy.  But it's just,  it's one of those things.  And yeah, I do talk about it a lot,  but it's a huge issue in the country. 
[01:47:00]  And the liberals are able  to just blab about it all the time.  No other whitey  is able to really talk about it  without having racists  printed on their head.  I don't give a shit  what anyone calls me.  So I talk about it  open and honest  the way I feel.  And I'm very well read on it.  So I talk about  the information  that I've garnered  over the years  of reading statistics  and whatnot.  And that's what I talk about.  Call me a racist.  I don't give a fuck.  I could care less.  Good.  I love it.  Call me a racist  because it only means 
[01:47:30]  I'm being open  and honest  where no one else  really is.  And thank God  we have this forum for it.  And that's why  you need to do  a political talk.  One of these days.  That silly ass fucking  what's his name?  Glenn Beck.  Glenn Beck.  Glenn Beck sucks.  But they all got  their hands tied too.  They're sitting there  you know they got  their Fox  fucking political  correct people  that say  well you can't say this  you can do this  but not that.  Here it's you know  that guy Scotty  could say whatever  the fuck he wanted  I say whatever  the fuck I want. 
[01:48:00]  There wasn't anything  no animosity there.  We're just discussing race.  Were you close to  which is a good  were you close to  calling on  dropping it  dropping it  were you close  I'll do it on the way  home in my car  with the windows  rolled up.  All right Rich Voss  joins the program next.  Also American Idol  started last night  it's a huge show  so we should pay  a little attention  yeah at least the opener  I think Sam watched  and of course he did  that facket  and it's the first night  so they had all the  assholes singing  really badly  and everyone had to  be surprised like

[01:50:00]  we're so frustrated  that everything you got  on you is  somebody else's  that you bought  online  for the most part  you buy everyone else's  used stuff  that is still  in good shape  you think I was  the first one  to fuck Bonnie  oh shit  alright one for one  brother  I'm keeping track  today  one for one  one for one  don't say anything  else right now  she just does  not deserve that  wow  and the boys  put this together 
[01:50:30]  so listen closely  and then it'll lead  to what you just  said to us  coming into the studio  on an all new  Jewish intervention  why are you always  looking for a deal  on everything  that's what I do  okay  this is my friend  comedian and Jew  Rich Voss  is confronted  about his frugal  spending habits  you never buy  yourself nice stuff  the car's always  two years old  nice other people  shit  there's always  something going  on with you  will this once  semi-famous comedian  be saved by his  more famous friends  you gotta go to  this new website  everything's on sale  like high end shit  see it's always 
[01:51:00]  that's what bothers me  you're wrong  you think you know  everything about everything  when was the last  thing you actually  bought something  brand new  and didn't go  looking for a deal  you don't get it  can the aging stand up  break the stereotype  that Jews  really  are cheap  there's no bartering  there's no  I mean maybe a little  hey do this do that  you know take a couple  you got a dead guy's watch  on you  see this right here  see this shit right here  dead guy's watch  or is it simply too late  it's too fucking late  for him to change  which is what he is  he's gonna go  to a fucking  garage sale  it's not the bargain  it's the fun  of a negotiating man 
[01:51:30]  it's not the bargain  I don't believe him  I don't believe him  I don't believe him  find out  on an all new  Jewish intervention  see  that's very funny  and you're gonna go  right back to the  garage sale  just like  they go right back  to the drugs  after that intervention  usually  it's the thing  like when I came in  they smashed  my other Rolex  so I wore this one  then it just hit me  I bought this one  who's they?  Patrice  and you guys  oh you know  they meaning us  oh an emotional smashing 
[01:52:00]  I thought it was  a physical smashing  no no emotional  cause last week  when I was in here  with Patrice  driving home  I fucking  I had so many  good comeback lines  and I really  won that argument  when he was  smashing my car  my dumb Boxster  I went online  and I got the  what is not  GPR  what is it  you know  the fucking  of a car  you know  the going price  or whatever  is that our 
[01:52:30]  security guy?  I knew it would  trip him up  I was trying  I was trying  to just point  it out to Travis  that Richard  Dreyfuss  has some kind  of Dreyfuss  initiative  seeks to further  civil discourse  and I was just  trying to point  to Travis  real quick  to go like  check that out  and see what it is  and Rich just went  right off the tracks  it was like  when the roadrunner  when the fucking  roadrunner  changes the train tracks  and puts it  into the fucking cliff  I think it was  kind of like  when you try  to host that pilot 
[01:53:00]  for Comedy Central  and you were  thrown out of  your game  I think it was  kind of like that  where you sat  up there  at comics  and you were  doing your thing  and you stuttered  your way  through the fucking  why so hurtful  did I stutter  why so hurtful  okay  how fucking  horrible you guys  are  anytime you  hit  anytime a camera  comes in front  of your fucking  faces  shut up  someone prepared  for his appearance  today  all right  I'm fucking  rolling up  my sleeves  motherfucker  I don't know  where you're  going down  that road  roll up 
[01:53:30]  those sleeves  it's gonna get  out of that  Rich Rich  there is one  difference  we were offered  and begged  to do that pilot  how many failed  pilots have you  presented to these  motherfuckers  no I've had  four failed  my own  we never knocked  on the door  saying we have  a pilot  they come to us  and go  could you please  do this  listen to me  Timmy temperamental  okay  oh is this  lingering inside  hey did I  really fail it  nobody gives a fuck  about you  and your dumb  pilot  okay  wait wait  they came to you  really how do you 
[01:54:00]  know that you  weren't the eighth  pick that they  came to  could have been  the 15th  I think it was  12th  you know that  that was such  a shitty idea  that we probably  were the eighth  people they came to  but they did  beg us  and we knew  we were in deep  trouble early on  because they didn't  even have a concept  for the show  they were making it  up as it went  along it was horrid  that's how I am  doing this right now  that just hit me  no one knows  all they know  is that you guys  failed at the pilot  and you fucked me up  because I would have  been in it 
[01:54:30]  thanks a lot  I don't  well I  you know  no it wasn't  your fault  that was awful  honestly I don't  think that one  was  there were other  ones that certainly  was our fault  but that one  was such a disaster  idea from the  beginning  it couldn't have  been any worse  than the lifetime  pilot we did  I brought it in  here you guys  have it somewhere  really  why are we  playing clips  with that  lifetime  with you and  Bonnie in studio  well you would  need about three  other comics  to smash us  all the way  through  we're doing  most embarrassing  tape  we did it  yesterday  we're doing it  next week  maybe you come  back with that  tape and  Bonnie  no next week 
[01:55:00]  I'm going to  Florida  oh then fuck you  why Bonnie  so she could  just show Rich  show her wedding  video  oh look at that  most embarrassing  tape  she came to me  Rich  so why did you  switch out watches  because I'm  going I'm thinking  well no one  can smash this  one this time  then I realize  I just bought  this one from  a friend too  oh so that  one's another  second hand  I put a new  bezel on it  oh a new  bezel  stupid bezels 
[01:55:30]  I hate the  bezel  so you walk  in the studio  during the break  and said I  actually walked  into an Apple  store because we  told you you  need an iPad  they're wonderful  I got one right  in front of me  I can't get  enough of this  I walked in  it's perfect  for radio  I had  a thousand  dollars cash  in my pocket  and just to set  it up  you were going  to buy  a used iPad  yeah  to practice on  I'm like why  buy a used  iPad  why don't you  go treat  yourself  you work  really hard  you travel  all over the  fucking country  slaving away  in these awful 
[01:56:00]  comedy clubs  with these  awful owners  like fucking  treat yourself  and get a  brand new  iPad  treat yourself  yeah  and that wasn't  a shot at you  by the way  it happens to  all you guys  no but  it happens worse  to me  fucking comedy  club owners out  there  horrible people  and so you  decided to go  into the Apple  store  and maybe  get yourself  a brand new  iPad  and then  what happened  well first  I went and  took  I had  Canadian money  at home  that I went  and invested  I thought  like my fucking  someone said 
[01:56:30]  that the whole  economy is going  to collapse  so you got  you put your  money in  Canadian money  I figured  wow  well because  here's my thought  that maybe  you know  we floop  the coop  and  you what  floop  the coop  what's  floop  the coop  floop  the coop  I need that  on a shirt  floop  the coop  what is it  floop  whatever  we scram  yeah  yeah  and you know  when everything  gets bad  and we go up  to Canada  because Bonnie's 
[01:57:00]  from Canada  then I'd have  Canadian money  right  so I fucking  you know  if all  if everything  fails  the bags  you know  you think  if everything  fails  Canada's  gonna be  the stable  nation  they're doing  okay  all the oil  up there  they're not  doing bad  because we're  down here  if anything  happened to the  United States  Canada would  crumble in a  second  dollars  well  are shit  I realize that  but if the  dollar craps  out  believe me  that Canadian  money with the  hockey players  on the back  of it 
[01:57:30]  is going  next  why  we're not  buying a lot  of oil  from them  I mean  they got tons  of oil  in fucking  Alberta  do they  why  what  the iPad  so I went  and exchanged  some Canadian  I cashed in  some Canadian  money at  Travel X  I worked out  a good deal  I worked out  a good deal  with Travel X  how do you  work out  a good deal  is it  exchange rate  no they  give me  a good deal  because I've  had a lot  of Canadian  money so I  go in there  a lot  what did you  say give  me more  than this  money's  worth  in American  they make  so much  they make 
[01:58:00]  a profit  I cut  their profit  out  did you hear  this though  yeah  yeah  he had to  make a deal  with his  Canadian  money  he's laundering  money  before  he goes  to the  Apple store  everything's  a deal  with you  once again  it's always  a deal  why not  just walk  in there  with a  credit card  and go  I need  a brand  new iPad  I could  do that  no you  can't  obviously  I walked  I walked  I walked  in there  and I  started  looking at  it  and I  started  doing it  and I  got an  anxiety  attack  right  because you're  not used to  you look at  the price 
[01:58:30]  and like  retail  it's not  money  it's not  about money  with me  okay  it's the  art  of the  deal  I'm very  fucking  frugal  all right  so  you're what  so I  was fucking  with it  you're  frugal  frugal  frugal  whatever the  fucking word  it's early  still  frugal  is this  before you  there's two  things  there's frivolous  which means  you spend a lot  or frugal  which means  you don't 
[01:59:00]  you combine  the word  to make it  somebody who  just spends  money normally  you just made  it into a  wash  yeah that's  a wash  it was a  wash  it's an  even break  it's right  here  so then I  went in there  and then I  went down  to the  AT&T store  asked some  questions  went over  to Verizon  asked some  questions  went back  to Apple  it's exhausting  what are you  Chris Hansen  he's doing  an expose  just to buy  an iPad  and then  I went  home

[02:00:00]  a deal  on Craigslist  for an  iPad  I can't  take that  chance  because  there was  a person  that said  cash only  and we'll  meet you  but you  could get  fucking  robbed  I hope  you get  an iPad  from somebody  that is  just filled  with kiddie  porn  and you  have no  fucking  idea  we have  the same  wish  and you're  in a  and they  somehow  get your  iPad  and you do  25 to  50  oh yeah  that's  Sing Sing  there's some  kind of  stash your  photos thing  here with a  password I  can't get  into  opening up

[02:04:30]  say  Craig  we were  selling our  couch  and one  person came  over  this girl  to look  at it  she walked  in  she looked  around  sat on  the couch  and said  okay  and left  and I'm  thinking  did she  just like  case my  house  you know  what I  mean  yeah  you know  what I  mean  I tapped  out for a  second  wait  you have  people  come  over  to  your  house  one  person  because  we  were  selling  the  couch  you  can't  take  the  couch  to  CVS  fuck  that  do all  my  transactions 
[02:05:00]  is  that  big  giant  old  couch  that  somebody  said  they  saw  over  your  house  yeah  she  could  have  cased  your  joy  yeah  that's  why  you're  a  celebrity  and now  you have  strangers  coming  into your  house  to check  out a  shitty  couch  that you're  selling  first of  all  how long  do you  sell a  couch  when people  when you  sell a  house  you find  people  when you  sell a  house  people come  in  yeah  but you're  leaving  right  you're  leaving 
[02:05:30]  the  house  and what  did she  do she  sat down  on the  couch  to check  it out  and then what  happened  she farted  into it  and left  got up  you know  and left  you know  I saw her in the car  I saw her in the car  right  right and stuffed  out  I saw her  right and stuffed  out  oh that's good  oh you think she was  writing about the couch  or what it might have  in your house  yeah that's why I won't  do that  that's dumb  even when I had no  money I didn't do  that shit  because it wasn't  craigslist then  I just  I just threw my  shit out 
[02:06:00]  on the curb  and then  hoped it found  a happy home  although I had  duct tape on my  couch by the time  it was throw away  time you know  duct tape the  fucking arm  because it's ripped  and shit  I decided not  to get a new one  because the kid  just spilled shit  all on it  oh so you're  going to wait  until the kid's  18 and then  get a new couch  what are you  going to sit on  he's right  I'm not buying  anything new  anytime soon  is your furniture  Travis yours too  there's snot  on everything  in my house 
[02:06:30]  oh god  so what did  the baby do  woo  thank you  when you talked  about the booger  couch  I understand  now  really  my kid  has put  snot  on  I think  every single  surface  in my house  everything  there's snot  on this shirt  somewhere  I'm sure  I was watching  my kid  just pick her  nose  like she was  opie  behind a  microphone  I don't do it  as much  but kids 
[02:07:00]  it's like  nothing  they'll just  shove their  finger in their  nose  and she comes  out with  these  ginders  that are  so fucking  big  and they  don't know  that you're  not supposed  to wipe  them  so it's  just  well they  gotta get  it off  their fingers  so the  nearest thing  they just  wipe it  on  that's it  but the  other night  like I'm  fucking old  my kid  see you guys  wait till your  kids are like  three years  like all my  daughter wants  to do is  play fuck  let's play  this play  that play 
[02:07:30]  this  so the  other night  I'm in a  room  I'm fucking  so tired  just play  with me  play with  me  I go  I got  a great  game  so what  I did  is  because I  play my  games  I sit  down  I can't  move  I go  you do  this  I have  a run  in front  of it  and I throw  a ball  at her  and try  to you know  so the  game I  invented  the other  night  I couldn't  move  I was so  tired  I go  okay  I'm gonna  lay down  and I'm  gonna  and I put  all these  little things  on me  I go  you're the  mouse  and you gotta  sneak in  and take  the cheese  off of my  body  sounds like 
[02:08:00]  something you  pay a  prostitute  for  Anthony  you know  what  I'm laying  on the  floor  half asleep  and she's  sneaking  taking toys  off my  stomach  you fell  asleep  it is  brilliant  to go  to sleep  I want  to beat  him up  but he  is talking  to every  fucking  father out  there right  that is  brilliant  because you  get to sleep  and the  whole game  is to  not wake  you up  my kid  is 8  months old  and he'll  yell and  scream  because he  wants out  of his  area  we made 
[02:08:30]  this area  with these  fences  and stuff  you set up  a concentration  camp  there's  little guard  towers  when we  were growing  up it was  a dumb  crib  but now  they got  great shit  that you can  build fortresses  and say  okay this is  a safe area  if the kid's  in here he's  not going  to kill  himself  for some  reason that's  all kids  want to do  is kill  themselves  and it's  your job  to make  sure they  don't kill  themselves  I wish  someone would  have taught  me this  before I  became a  father  that's your  whole job  to make  sure he  doesn't die  during the 
[02:09:00]  day  it's  ridiculous  so he  starts whining  because he  doesn't want  to be in  there anymore  so you  go in  his safe  area  and you  invent  shit  to keep  him  preoccupied  and most  of the  time it's  me in  there  sleeping  on a  pillow  and let  him climb  all over  you  because in  his crazy  mind  that's  some kind  of game  he's the  mountain  my kids  when they  were young  my older  daughters  and when  they used  to come  to my  house  who's  the fat  fucking  jets  cheerleader  how did 
[02:09:30]  she get  on the  team  how did  she get  on the  flight crew  that one  right there  in the  front  she's too  fat to be  part of  the flight  crew  she's for  the black  player  she looks  like  she's  healthy  she's a little  too healthy  to be part  of the  flight crew  it's all  about the  jets  they're having  a big pep  rally in  times square  this is  the  news  you know  having  fucking  cheerleaders  on the  news  that's  brilliant  though  inventing  games  to keep  your kid  occupied 
[02:10:00]  I used to do  with my two  daughters  I made a game  you run into  your room  whoever can  clean up the  most things  by the time  I count to  25  and one would  run in and  come back  and go  I cleaned  six things  I go  okay you  go  and they  would clean  the room  like that  and it  was a game  that doesn't  work for long  from what I  hear  I hear like  the clean  up game  works for a  very short  time and the  I'm cleaning  up here  being a  father  if you  could get  five minutes  of peace  that's all  that matters  I'm not 
[02:10:30]  going for  an hour  five minutes  so there's  the answer  to your  question  why are  you going  to Florida  and say  you're  working  and if  that means  letting him  have at  the Tupperware  drawer  then fucking  go for it  man  that'll give  me five  minutes to  check my  shit  online  when they're  small we  were in a  hotel one  night  and I  thank god  I noticed  that she  walked in  and turned  the gas  on  we would  have went  to sleep  holy shit  oh you 
[02:11:00]  would have  went to  sleep  all right  our little  the  eternal  sleep  thank you  for killing  us  thanks  as you're  all walking  toward the  light  thanks  you think  you got a  deal on  price line  right  you want  to talk  about  American  Idol  or the  Octomoms  that don't  baby  take  a little  I guess  Idol being  new  this  thing  yesterday  first  I want  to know  about the  new judges  and stuff  the first  show  I couldn't  be bothered  you got rid  of the guy  that was the 
[02:11:30]  reason to watch  the show  Simon  Simon Cowell  Simon Cowell  very predictable  but he was  worth watching  now you got  a bunch of  guys that are  way too  nice  you got  Ryan Seacrest  way too  nice  you got  Steven Tyler  way too  fucking  nice  you got  J-Lo  way too  fucking  nice  and then  I'm  looking at  the paper  they're  trying to  make  Randy Jackson  sort of  the  almost not  nice  guy  and he  can't even  be as  mean as  they probably  want him  to  they had  meters  in the 
[02:12:00]  paper  today  Steven Tyler  way on  the nice  side  J-Lo  way on  the nice  side  and then  Randy  sort of  you know  why  he's  the  season  vet  he's  been  there  he knows  the deal  Jesus  please  what do  you got  Sam  on this  American Idol  Steven Tyler  wasn't  as nice  as they're  letting on  he wasn't  mean  he's not  going to  ever be  really mean  he took  a couple  shots  here  and  there  like  one  guy  sung  poorly  and he  said  you just  scared  everybody  in the  room  oh  that's  crazy  which is  really funny  though  is because 
[02:12:30]  they're big  stars now  the judges  every time  either J-Lo  or Steven Tyler  makes a joke  you can hear  every producer  who's off  camera going  hold on  hold on  we got a  first timer  here  Edward  in Tennessee  Edward  how are you  sir  what's  going on  man  I just  wanted to  say  I'm a  first time  listener  man  and y'all  are cooler  and shit  dude  what were you  listening to  before the  Opie and  Anthony show  I was just  listening to  the regular  AM FM radio  man 
[02:13:00]  I'm an over  road truck  driver  and I just  got to  turn it on  dude  like I said  man  y'all  are cooler  and shit  god  this means  this means  we're gonna  have to  do radio  for another  five years  we don't  want you  guys  listening  anymore  do you  understand  that  we don't  want new  listeners  the old  ones  to just  die off  so they  can leave  do you  understand  that  I don't  want  new  listeners  I want  the audience  to slowly  dwindle to  nothing  and then I  can go  and enjoy  a few  years ago  it's time  to go  Jesus  what's your  first impression  of the show  what are you  liking about 
[02:13:30]  the Opie and  Anthony show  as a first  timer  welcome  welcome  to the  program  welcome  to the  show  sir  so  American Idol  that's some  old school  never gets  old  see  if he's a  fan  he'll find  out what  the fuck  that's all  about  yeah  whatever  Sam  so  Steven Tyler  trying to  be a little  mean spirited  yeah  I mean  J-Lo  she has  a lot  of trouble  telling people  that they  are not  going to  Hollywood  she can't  say no  she's that  one 
[02:14:00]  she's Paul  Abdul  she's got  to be  everyone's  mommy  sometimes  the dog  has to  come  you know  Randy Jackson  yeah  really  what did  he do  in music  by the way  Randy Jackson  yeah  what did  he do  play guitar  for Journey  when no one  cared about  Journey anymore  yeah  no  I mean  I don't  I never  that's exactly  what happened  yeah  he got  into Journey  playing bass  what  and no one  gave a shit  about Journey  at that point  what years  what Journey  years  oh geez  after  they already  hit their destination  with a mouthful 
[02:14:30]  of food  he fucking  swings that one  and hits the fence  and I would  almost bet a lot  of money  that one of  their albums  was called  Destination  probably  it was always  something  that had  something to do  with Journey  all of their albums  it was something  Departure  what the fuck  else was it  and they're still  doing well  with the  Escape  Frontiers  here you go  yes  look at all 
[02:15:00]  the Journey  Journey  look into the future  Arrival  Affinity  Arrival  they finally made it  they have Departure  we're leaving again  stopping for gas  Escape  I gotta take a piss  I was  those are the albums  with Randy Jackson  by the way  speaking of fucking music  I was in the gym  the other day  I was taking a piss  right  you know when you  tap your dick  well Boston's song  was on More Than a Feeling  and it was like  a guitar thing  and I was hitting my dick  oh really  a Boston song  with a guitar thing 
[02:15:30]  that's crazy  I was tapping my dick  like I was playing guitar  oh no  I kept doing it  why  because I kept doing it  and I was  because I was getting  into the song  as I was tapping my  tapping your dick  to the song  to get the tinkle off  it's been such a long time  dead  that guy's dead  Randy Jackson  did some bass  and some I guess  backup vocals  from 85 to 86  and then 86 to 87  so I guess  so he wasn't even  in Journey 
[02:16:00]  why does he brag  about that shit  the number one thing  that Randy Jackson  has done  is he's been a judge  on American Idol  for 10 years  that's his number one  how's Jerry doing  with the Filipino guy  pretty good I guess  they're still touring  still doing alright  yeah  that ended the conversation  that's my job  that's wonderful  who wants to see  a fucking Filipino  lead singer  you hear what he sounds like  sounds like Steve Perry  but with a little bit  of a lisp  which makes it fun  for everybody  oh 
[02:16:30]  looks a little weird  he sounds exactly  like Perry  except he has a lisp  with a lisp  oh  isn't Perry  from Aerosmith  or he's got  that going in his voice  isn't Perry  from Aerosmith  he's from  yeah  yeah  there's another Perry  that's Tyler  that's Steve Tyler  right  no there is a Perry  in Aerosmith  isn't there  yeah  Joe Perry  but it's not the same guy  he's the guitar player  alright what the fuck  half the name's right  500%  gets into the hall of the phone  listen for the  this is 
[02:17:00]  we haven't done this in a while  this is a different guy  this is Steve Perry  this is the new guy  sounds just like Perry  this is the new guy  come on  oh my god  just a small town  yes  yes  yeah  it's weird  hey  it's like  it's like Journey 
[02:17:30]  was made into  Speed Racer characters  it's like watching  Lost in Translation  Lost in Translation  Translation  yeah  Lost in Translation  you're right  Lost in Translation  I knew what that was  I just made it  you want to beat up this kid  but he sounds  just like  it really is  fucking ridiculous  Steve Perry  I would so see this 
[02:18:00]  I mean  if you're into  most bands  when they change out  the lead singer  I don't want to see them anymore  but I would so go to this show  and from a distance  he's like  you can't see his eyes  Arnel Panetta  something like that  what happened to the lead singer 
[02:18:30]  what happened to the lead singer  he was an asshole  he was an asshole  he was an asshole  and then Journey goes  oh really  well there's this kid  in the Philippines  that sounds exactly like you  go fuck yourself  we're bringing him in  we're paying a minimum wage  and we're going to sell out arenas  and that's what they did  and didn't they re-record  some of the old tracks  to put out  as a greatest hit  so that they didn't have to  paste it there  they got a greatest hits  with this guy  in lead vocals  and no one gives a crap  they're buying it  whoa  holy shit 
[02:19:00]  that's the story of Journey  oh man  that's got to be really tough  on the lead singer  and they reinvented themselves  look  they're in Chile  they're probably playing  in front of 100,000 people  look at how many people  are there  that might be 100,000  I played at Woodstock  I hosted it  I hosted it  I hosted it  third stage  no I was on the second  and I was offered to do the main 
[02:19:30]  but I didn't want things thrown at me  okay  you didn't want doo-doo thrown at you  they were throwing everything  I know they were  and then Papa were the hosts  over on the main stage  and they go  do you want to do that  no  fuck that  fuck that  alright listen  where are we  so idle  oh  let's be honest with each other  how many numbers  do you think Steven Tyler  is getting from the little girls  I don't know  but this is the first season  where they're allowing 15 year olds  because that's  the deal Steven Tyler made  with the American Idol people  why haven't I been watching  it's brand new  you can watch tonight  what 
[02:20:00]  it's on every night  it's on Wednesdays and Thursdays  it's crazy  yeah  the first 15 year old  ever to go to Hollywood  this is like  toddlers in tiaras  that's right  they did a whole bit though  about  Steven Tyler flirting  with the young girls  really  like a whole montage  but that's not a bit  of girls  Steven Tyler  would take young pussy  yeah  so they make believe  it's a bit  it's not a bit  do you know anything  about Steven Tyler  is it mine  a 15 or 16 year old 
[02:20:30]  well I don't know that  because that's elite  I have no idea  Sam  that's your sign  I would hope not  he probably at least looks  I mean it's a television show  it's part of his job  right  yeah he's got a look  he's got a judge  he's got a look at that  nice fucking snare drum  tight ass  aesthetics are important  supple breasts  didn't they raise  the age limit too  on it  I know it at least  goes to 25  I don't know how  they had an age limit too  oh yeah  I didn't know that  they've always had the age limit  I just thought they just  kind of just avoided  those people  so last night 
[02:21:00]  was asshole night  no no no  it wasn't  it was jersey  it was just the jersey auditions  but it was asshole night  what do you mean  asshole  well early on  they focus on the idiots  that have no business  trying out for American Idol  and then the judges  have to make believe  like whoa  how did he get in our room  they make those wacky faces  like oh boy  this is crazy  like it's not set up  ahead of time  where they  where they  make sure they get  a group of the idiots  and the assholes  to bring in front of the judges  that's the other thing  that's wrong with this season  because everybody knows 
[02:21:30]  when the auditions started  because now  it's all over the news  there's auditions going on  and everybody knows  when the new judges  got signed up  and everybody knows  that the auditions  happened  way before the new judges  signed up  which means that  there were no judges  in New Jersey that day  so when did that happen  so they had the people  audition in Jersey  for producers  and come back  like a month and a half later  when they had judges  they just got like 50 people  40 of them were good  and 10 of them sucked  producers 
[02:22:00]  they just performed  in front of  yeah  interns  two things before we move on  someone is saying  Jacob  thank you Jacob  he says  look up Dean Casanova  I know Dean Casanova  I've interviewed him  a few times  he's the drummer  in Journey  and this guy's saying  he sounds even better  than the Filipino  new lead singer  at doing  Steve Perry  is that possible  this would be new knowledge  is it just easy  to sing Steve Perry  I'm wondering now  we better call you a brother  yeah 
[02:22:30]  yeah really  dude  one of Anthony's friends  was supposed to be  Steve Perry  Hugo  Hugo  what do you mean  he was supposed to be  Hugo sounds even  maybe even better  than the Filipino guy  and we know Hugo  and looks exactly like  Steve Perry  Hugo  yeah Hugo  but spelled Hugo  Valenti  yeah he's a great singer  he auditioned  he's in a Journey cover band  he's in a Journey cover band  and then  years ago  Journey actually got in touch  with him and said  we want you to  that's like the movie  Rockstar  yeah  only he said no  why did he say no 
[02:23:00]  because he had another band  at the time  that was actually being  promoted and shit  and didn't want to leave  Valentine  I interviewed Hugo  when he was promoting  Valentine  yeah  this is way inside now  I told the story  though  I was at BAB  they were on the soundtrack  of Don't Tell Mom  the babysitter's dead  but I was at BAB  I'll tell the Hugo story again  yeah  big movie  Hugo used to cut the grass  at BAB  he told the story  on the air  and a week later  because all of a sudden  his band hit  he's now in BAB 
[02:23:30]  being interviewed  that's how it works  that's how it works  topsy turvy world  but he goes  I was the landscaper  for you know  the BAB facility  whatever  BAB got all their  employees from  maintenance  I know  exactly  yeah  and was doing  the air  landscaper  sheet metal worker  we need another host  who's doing the hot tar  who's up on the roof  see if he's got a talent  someone's up on the roof  get him down here  boss you're right  let's say hi to Stryker  Stryker  Stryker  it's been a while 
[02:24:00]  yeah hey boy  hey you guys just missed  the bosses  and right  you cued up the journey music  boss said he was  half right  he was 500%  and it would get him  into the hall of fame  he's half right  he was 500%  oh 50%  he's got half the name right  and that's good enough  to be in the hall of fame  500%  yeah  500%  well that's hitting 500  if you're one for two  you're 500  so that's not wrong  no it's not 500%  it means 500.500 
[02:24:30]  so you're trying to say  you're better than Ted Williams  and you should be in the hall of fame  is that the guy  that just got arrested  yeah that's the guy  Ted Williams  oh my god  great ball player  and what a voice  wow  so  no he's dead  everyone's saying  that Dean Castronova  is unbelievable singing journey  so why did they go  and get the other guy  maybe they didn't want  a drummer singing  they should have had him sing  and they should have found  a new drummer  a bunch of people are saying  really  now is there  is there a tape  of this guy singing 
[02:25:00]  let me see  Steve Perry songs  um  you getting a thing  oh I guess  Hugo's new band  is Voyage  Voyage  Voyage  see Journey  Voyage  I guess  I don't know  is that coming from  Sister Dawn  hi Donnie  wait is Voyage  a Journey cover band  I would think so yes  okay  yeah  but he could have been  in Journey  I know  so why does he turn down  Journey to be in  a Journey cover band  well that was back  in the day  when he was with 
[02:25:30]  the Valentine  so the Valentine  thing didn't hit  that's a good movie  didn't Valentine  have success in Europe  as one of those bands  who hasn't  fucking Blotto did  good point  I wanna be a life god  huge in Europe  I could even be  a rock god in Europe  fucking hot the half  never sang before  but I'm sure  I throw something together  and throw it in  the Asian market  I'll be a fucking hero  I'm telling you  we could start a band  the round eyes 
[02:26:00]  okay  nothing on that one  that's what they call us  that's what they call us  round eyes  now you're at  480%  uh oh  keep those  hall of fame numbers up  or you're not gonna be  on the ballot  you're not even gonna be  on the ballot  by the end of the show  Jesus Christ  you're gonna be like  a Steve Garvey  ah there it is  where's the guy  what's the guy's name  we need to look up  Dean Castronovo 
[02:26:30]  or is it Nova  I always forget  some from Journey  he's the drummer  from Journey  and supposedly  he sings better  than the Filipino guy  but they decided  to go with the Filipino guy  maybe because  he has the look  Dean Castronovo  do we have video  of him singing  Journey  that's all we need  to know  yeah  oh  Dean Castronovo  never heard of him  never heard of him  sir  never heard of him  sir  let's see 
[02:27:00]  singing  mother father  that's a  it's not a hit  but  who's crying now  will work I guess  ah there you go  so here's the drummer  the original drummer  everyone in the band 
[02:27:30]  can sing  like Steve Perry  I think they just  want to make it  really hurt  as Steve Perry  stays home  it's like look  we could  we all could  do your part  asshole  we all could  have done it  here's the guitar  tech doing  don't stop  believing 
[02:28:00]  and look  he's playing  drums  doing it  he's like  not only  can I do  your fucking  part  I can do  mine too  I'll play  the fucking  drums  at the same  time  Jesus Christ  the problem  with the drummer  being mic'd  you really hear  the drums  yeah  yeah  a little problem  there  that's a little  rough to hear  is there another  one up there  shit  but yeah  the guy could do  fucking Steve Perry  Steve Perry

[02:30:30]  oh yeah  let me see  that guy  it's like  oh yeah  that's funny  I'll see  that guy  Tuesday  next Tuesday  I'm in  Boca  at the  Funky Buddha  Funky Buddha  in Boca  yeah  Funky Buddha  in Boca  so I'm going to  tweet something  funny  is that Robert  Kelly's place  ah damn  didn't know he  was a comedy  club owner  that was so  hack  I gotta slap  myself  that wasn't  it was kind  of hack  it was kind  of hack  do you  have you guys  watched that show  I should be dead 
[02:31:00]  yes  yes  which one  did you see  did you see the one  yesterday with the  girl in the Grand Canyon  what did she do  bitch  what an asshole  I did the Grand Canyon  what'd she do wrong  see everything  did she hike  down and back  to the river  that was my mistake  I should be dead  I should be on that  show  three weeks  she was stuck  in there for three  weeks in the Grand  Canyon with no food  water  how did you  exactly  you can't get lost  in the Grand Canyon  believe it or not 
[02:31:30]  you really can't  she did  how  you just stay on the  trail  no no she went  off trail  why you go off trail  she drove way the  fuck up to this  place  this plateau  in her car  right okay  then she gets her  backpack which has  a sleeping bag  water food  all this stuff  and she's gonna go  to the Indian  village  she started out  late  so it was getting  a little dark  so she's gotta go  to this Indian  village  to spend the night  there's you know  resources there  and people and shit  so she sets off  with her and a  little dog 
[02:32:00]  and she gets  to a crossroad  and the sign  isn't very well  marked there  and she goes  see the right  or left  she makes a right  the village was left  oh boy  so she goes right  and now she's  walking kind of  in the dark  so now she can't  retrace her steps  to get back  to where she was  she has to spend  the night  she's crying  she's got a little  dog with her  I understand  one night in the  Grand Canyon  you could do that  why three weeks  what happened  where it turned  into three weeks  because she kept  walking  because she couldn't  backtrack  she tried backtracking 
[02:32:30]  and got lost again  and then she's like  you know  and here's the best part  she's like  whew  I'm exhausted  and it's  I bet it's from  carrying this  backpack  so what I'm  going to do  is take my  backpack off  and just leave it  on the ground  and keep walking  and you know  there's food  and water in there  but I gotta run  into somebody  she does that  and now she  falls asleep  loses her place  can't get back  to the backpack  can't find water  she found a trickly  little thing of water 
[02:33:00]  and finally  what she would do  is drink a lot  of water  sit out for an hour  come back  drink more water  sit out in another  direction for an hour  come back  drink more water  so she couldn't  leave the water area  but how'd she figure out  how to get back  to the water area  I guess she really  traced her steps  and made sure  and then she finally  finds an old vodka bottle  so she's like  now I can set off  she fills up  the vodka bottle  she drinks out of it  puts it in her bag  and now she's gonna  climb up this little  rock hill 
[02:33:30]  to get a better  look at things  she's climbing up  clang  the bottle  falls out of the bag  and breaks  it's like  that has become  the most important  thing in your life  that bottle  you do anything  to not break it  why put it  at the top  of your pocketbook  why not bury it  under everything  it was hanging out  like a baguette  in a french movie  in a grocery bag  like a  like fucking lettuce  top of fucking  lettuce  I'm so annoyed  when that water bottle  broke I go  die bitch 
[02:34:00]  I go  just shut up  and then she  finally after  three weeks  gives up  she goes  she's just gonna  go to sleep  and not wake up  in the sun  and then some  Indians came  and found her  and yeah  if I was lost  I would give up  right away  because that's  when they find you  they always find  a way to give up  so you're saying  day one  hour one  give up  and they'll find you  just give up  that crap  of trying to find  your way  for three weeks  that never works  can I have that  but as soon as you  give up 
[02:34:30]  that is good  that's a good one  you give up  right away  you're gonna take  my fucking line  I asked if I can have it  you can only use it  once on the radio show  you can use it  for 20 years  next time we wake off  for a ham and cheese sandwich  I'll give you that one  because you know  hiking  people that go hiking  and I'm sure  someone in this room  does  I don't know who  okay I know  who doesn't  but  Anthony hikes  you hike  and he got lost  from upstairs  to the fucking basement  and Anthony  should be dead  nothing good  he's one of those  should be dead guys  he got lost 
[02:35:00]  he got lost  up in the woods  upstate New York  overnight  nothing good  comes out of hiking  nothing  you never hear a good story  no  you never see a rainbow  or get a four leaf clover  double rainbow  yeah  what the fuck good  comes out of hiking  nothing  nothing  tragedy  I like hiking  hate hiking  I like being warm  Melinda made me hike  and then  we get to the top of the hill  and she goes  oh here's another way down  it's a different way down  that we'll see different things  it's like  how about we take the same way down  no no 
[02:35:30]  I did this as a kid  oh really  boom  we run down the side  we're just lost  all night long  I'm spending  it's pouring rain  I'm freezing  we're in the woods  I'm just  I'm looking out  at a fog bank  I got nothing  did your survival skills  kick in  none  none right  my fucking  my weird so  I was like  and I don't know  how those fucking  those  those soccer players  there  in alive  I don't know  how they lasted  that long  because I was looking  at her  other soccer players 
[02:36:00]  other soccer players  I was ready to just  take a bite out of her calf  I was like  fuck this  I'm hungry  supposedly that's all  you would need too  just a little protein  a little bit  it goes a long way  gets you through  and it was raining  that's the only reason  we lived  because  there was water  there was water  from the rain  did you see  and I should be dead  the guy's plane crash  with two other guys  in the mountains  it's fucking  snow up to their heads  freezing  okay  two  one guy's laying there  with a broken leg  can't move  the other one's got a punctured 
[02:36:30]  everything  right  so he's got to go  get help  it's freezing  he has no gloves  nothing  he's walking through  freezing cold fucking water  he's hiking across  he can't make it  he's not gonna die  somehow  he's just  it's frozen  he's walking through  ice water  you know  no gloves  I can't even walk  to the garbage can  in a snowstorm  you know what I mean  who the fuck  go sleigh riding  with a kid  go fuck yourself  it's freezing  so 
[02:37:00]  somehow  they are found  they've  you know  and the guy  gets in a helicopter  to go get it  and that crashes  he crashed  he crashed  twice  that means  God wants you dead  just give it up  give it up  and everyone's saying  you got the name  of the show  wrong  but I think  it should be called  I should be dead  yeah what's it called  I shouldn't be alive  it should be  I should be dead  it should just be  I should be dead  yeah  I should be dead  did you see the one 
[02:37:30]  with the guy in the ice  that fell in the ice crevice  him and his friend  no get the fuck  they were tethered together  one guy falls in the ice crevice  and he's falling  but the weight of the guy  on the end of the rope  that's still up there  is lowering him slowly down  right  so he hits bottom  of the crevice  but he was let down  kind of slow  because his buddy  is trying to hold him back  his buddy then  flops over the edge  no rope  no nothing to keep him  falls to his death  Jesus  so he's dead 
[02:38:00]  now the other guy  who's a rookie climber  has to ice pick  an ice shoe  his way  out of this  80 foot  deep crevice  it was sick  a little anxiety action  we gotta take a break  because Steve Merchant  is waiting to come on the show  yes let's get him in  god damn it  a forest ranger  really fast  Kevin in New York  Kevin  hello  hello  real fast  because we gotta take a break  yes  hopey you're a genius  that's the thing  everybody's gotta do  is just give up immediately 
[02:38:30]  we search for hours  for people that are  wandering around  if they sit down  we'll find you  yeah it's always  stay in one place  just give up immediately  give up right away  as you start wandering off  way too far  from where they're gonna find you  you know and if you're gonna go hiking  bring matches or something  start a fight  bring something  in the pouring rain  I was sitting there with like a rock  and a stick  and I'm just going  this is useless  and once again  when we were off the air  I treated my brother  to a trip to the Grand Canyon  because he is a big hiker  I said let's do the ultimate hike 
[02:39:00]  and he decided  he needed to touch the Colorado River  and back in one day  which they highly recommend  you don't do  as you're going down the trail  there's signs everywhere  don't fucking hike too far  make sure you get out of here  before the sun goes down  long story short  we had a hike out of the Grand Canyon  in the middle of the night  it was the scariest thing ever  does it get  pretty dark right  pretty fucking  and you don't know  what's on the trail  you don't know  if the rattlesnakes  are coming out now  because it's not as hot  and you hear the coyotes 
[02:39:30]  it's fucking scary as shit  fuck that  does it get as cold at night  in the desert  as it does hot in the day  we were so fucking hot  from sweating our balls off all day  that it was a relief  but I don't know if that was good or bad  yeah it gets fucking  pretty cold  yeah  all right  we really gotta take a break  for Steve Merchant  stay there  Steve Merchant next  a real funny  fucking talented  creative motherfucker  that's what we got next  yeah this  is the Opie and Anthony show  on the virus 
[02:40:00]  Sirius XM  the Opie and Anthony show  on the virus  Sirius XM  thank you Reg  that means a lot  right now  what is he talking about  we got Stephen Merchant 
[02:40:30]  on the radio  yes  Stephen Merchant  hi  how are you Stephen  I'm alright  how are you guys  great  are we on live now  yeah  what are the rules  you can swear can't you  you can swear  you can do whatever you want  right  this is why  this is American freedom of speech  that they let you guys on  just to swear  it's satellite speech  freedom of speech  regular radio though  they still  they're like  even if you say tit  they'll freak out  which is the dumbest fucking thing ever  oh there you are  swearing again  yeah there it is  is that what people tune in for  they want the swearing 
[02:41:00]  they look forward to  early on I think  they were into that  now it's like  enough with the fucks  what do you got to say  it's pretty much  it's pretty much the way  I just talk  normally  which is kind of freeing  did you have much of a career  on regular radio  yeah we had a pretty good run  for a while  we fucked that up  really well  and we're exiled here now  we had three  over the top  amazing firings  I thought you were going to say  fans  that's true  I think it was three  right  we told Boston  the mayor was dead 
[02:41:30]  that got us a firing  but it also got us  a great promotion  we got to move to New York  and do radio  yeah  and then we fucked that up  by having  allegedly a couple have sex  at St. Pat's Cathedral  St. Patrick's Cathedral  they had sex  in the church  we were on the air  yeah  well Stephen  we figured our  Stephen  we figured our careers  I might shoot off guys  if I'm honest  this is not the sort of radio  I'm into  I'm a classy guy  I work for the BBC  I can tell  I can tell  Stephen  we figured our careers 
[02:42:00]  were going so well  who needs to be successful  so we blew it up  in one day  one fucking day  one day  it happens  as a guest on their show  they were gaining so much heat  they were in like 20 markets  and I was on all the time  I'm going  this is fucking great  I went and bought a Mercedes  and I got fired  the next fucking day  yeah  some kind of lesson there  TV was calling  don't depend on us  TV was calling  magazines  we were in a magazine  every other week  since then  nothing  nothing  now we just come in 
[02:42:30]  we punch the clock  and realize  you just finish up  the hours before you die  we realize we're on  the downside of our careers  yeah yeah  we're on you know  the down slope  good but I'm glad to be here  in the glory years  the post glory years  you know  some people  you meet on the way up  as you're on the way down  sure  you know  it's like watching people  on the escalator  when you're going down  and they're coming up  you're just like  oh hi  congrats  and have fun  wherever you end up  I'm down to the basement  we gave up 
[02:43:00]  trying to get to the point  we were  we just gave up  yeah yeah  for a while  we were just like  yeah let's get back  we'll get right back there  syndicated nationally  on regular terrestrial radio  around the country  we'll do it  and you know what  how bitter are you  a little bit  look at our faces  I'd be bitter  I'm 20 years old  it really has taken its toll  that old gag  I'd be bitter  I'm doing a lot of old gags today man  I would be bitter though  if I  if you know  I didn't have it so well 
[02:43:30]  see it's been  life's okay for you  it treated me well  so now I just feel  kind of like  what is it that gets you  through the day  booze  yeah  I like booze  girls  and guns  those are like  my three  and not even in that order  I think it's in that order  is it in that order  I think it might be  in that order  Holocaust movies  no  not quite  Holocaust movies  I'm not German  no  Schindler's list was pretty good 
[02:44:00]  no you point  and go ha ha  Stephen  he's a fan of the  I like the era  I like the whole era  the Holocaust era  no not the Holocaust era  as much as the  it gets another bad press  there must have been  some good stuff  something  there's always  sunshine after the rain  there must have been  something  there must have been  something  you know during that time  someone was having fun  somewhere  two people must have  had sex in a church  somewhere  but it wasn't  in an attic  no  it was a quiet time 
[02:44:30]  I'm thinking  there's one guy  that came home from work  to find that his wife  was no longer in the house  and might have been  a little happy  that's all I'm saying  you think  but no one wants to talk  about that side  of these horrific things  that happened  jackboot prints  on his floor  and kind of went like  ah  and when  they  they  she's gone  they took her  and then he had  a fake cry  and all  and then he escaped  and went to some  other country  and got remarried  that's a movie there  there's a holocaust movie  for you  that is  oh my god 
[02:45:00]  what a lovable character  he'll be  lovable  maybe kevin james  could play him  well our tragedy  is obviously  you know  9-11  you're trying to tell me  now  there wasn't one guy  that died that day  that was the biggest  piece of shit  and when it happened  they went  oh my god  look  this is the luckiest  day of my life  just  hey  call in  if you are  if you're that guy  or you're new  if you owed someone 
[02:45:30]  a hundred thousand dollars  that died that day  by the way  if we did this break  on regular radio  or tv  fired  sure  because no one  wants to talk  in those terms  obviously  it's offensive  obviously  it's morally repugnant  obviously  it was an over the top  horrific day  for just about  everybody  just about  but I'm saying  there was  maybe a few people  that said  wow  I was in trouble  yesterday  no trouble  instantly out of trouble  right  yeah  I've watched  the Ricky Gervais show 
[02:46:00]  the animated podcast  fucking hysterical  oh cool  thank you  it is so god damn  funny  man  and  and  a little round headed  shit  Carl  Carl  that  and I'm sure  because we've  gotten asked  from certain  retards  we have on our show  is that real  is that guy  real  that is  you can't fake  that kind of stupidity  I always think  when people say  it's Carl real  they are  the Carls  of their group 
[02:46:30]  right  right  you know what I mean  because you can't  people say  do you write it  you could not write  no  the stuff  he was talking about  the pyramids  we showed him a picture  of the pyramids  because we sent him  on this show  where he travels  around the world  yeah  and he looked at the pyramids  and he said  bad design  bad design  he said  the living room  huge  bedroom's tiny  we have to point out  it's a mausoleum  it's not a house  it's not a house  Carl  but you can't  I don't think  an intelligent comic  can come up with that  because I don't  because it would never  occur to you  it was a house  right  right  you know  if you know  it's a crypt  you can't 
[02:47:00]  sort of unlearn that  you're not gonna  yeah  you're not gonna  think of it  as a house  it's a crypt  bad design  the pyramids  which have been  bad design  he was furious  because they were  the great pyramids  and the great wall  of China  he said  I'll be the judge  of that  they're just  the wall of China  they're a pyramid  I'll decide if they're great  it's like he was  annoyed at ancient  Egypt  for naming it that  how did this start  now  I know you guys  had this great idea  of making him famous  right  now where  where did he  originally come from  you guys just know him  he comes from  Manchester 
[02:47:30]  in the north of England  and we  Ricky and I  used to host  a radio show together  and then I think  we got fired  probably for something  far less controversial  than you guys  just for being shit  sex at the abbey  right  and then we  had some success  with the office  and stuff  so then they  invited us back  and we returned  like conquering heroes  they gave us  the Saturday morning  graveyard slot  I gotta slow you down  for one second  because too many people  are going  who is Stephen Merchant  come on  you need to know  who Stephen Merchant is  he's Ricky Gervais'  partner in crime 
[02:48:00]  they've done a ton  of stuff together  extras  I'm just finally  starting to get  into extras  and I can't get  enough of it  the British office  obviously  this new show  on HBO  yeah this  looks  the radio show  together  like you guys  said  yeah the podcast  I saw the season  premiere  a few days ago  where he came up  with the movie idea  well so for the people  emailing in  saying they don't  know who the hell  we are  I worked with Ricky  for years  and then we  started doing  this radio show  again  and Carl  is this round headed 
[02:48:30]  dude who was just  here to press the  buttons  I don't know  which of these  people in this  room is your  gimp  but  and we just  started asking him  questions and he  just started  answering with  these with  these answers  that you just  wouldn't expect  you know  yeah  just offering  up stories  but just  offering up  stories like  you know  about some  dude he knew  who had a  horse he kept  in the house  but just like  that was normal  that was a  normal thing  you know  yeah I knew  I had a horse  in the house  like we're  supposed to  go okay  move on  and um  and since then  yeah Ricky  has been keen  to make him  into a 
[02:49:00]  reluctant star  which he's  definitely done  yeah  we gotta do  that with  Rich Ross  Ricky's laugh  at Carl  it kills me too  he'll just  laugh hysterically  and then just  go you're mad  you're mad  it fucking  kills me  every time  well the season  premiere of the  HBO show I  think was when  he talked  he had a meeting  he got invited to  a meeting with  some movie  producers  and he told us  this idea that  he'd improvised  on the spot  which he thought  was inspired  starring  it was a movie  starring Rebecca  de Mornay  which as I 
[02:49:30]  pointed out  would be great  if it was  1985  and um  and uh  Clive Warren  Clive Warren  he meant  Clive Owen  but  Clive Warren  was the star  and they  wouldn't stop  calling him  Clive Warren  the whole show  it was killing me  it's like  oh you mean  Clive Warren  he's the fucking  he's extraordinary  but this  so this show  we did on HBO  this is the  and then we've  done this other show  which is on the  Science Channel  which is uh  we sent him around  in the world  against his will  to see the  seven wonders  of the world  and he actually 
[02:50:00]  hated it  he tried to  buy his way  out of it  three times  he was like  stranded in the  jungle in  in the middle of  nowhere  just phoning the  producers saying  I'll give the  money back  send me home  it is great  he's a great  uh  you can't even  say character  because it's  really him  yeah  and um  the animations  look great too  I mean  it does add  so much  to the  Barbara  yeah  yeah  very old  school to it  uh  and adds so  much to it  but he comes  up with ideas  um  which he thinks  of sensible ideas  he said  he just went  you know what  would be good  see-through skin 
[02:50:30]  because then the  doctors could just  look through the  skin they could  see what's going  on in there  but then to him  like that idea  should then be  applied  scientists should  just go  forget dealing  with AIDS  let's get the  see-through skin  going  his idea  with the movie  half the brain  is classy  whoever's listening  obviously you gotta  watch it  but uh  yeah  just that you  could take  somebody else's  half of the brain  because he heard  that you could  you could function  with half a brain  so take someone  else's half a brain  that is either in a 
[02:51:00]  coma or dead  or whatnot  and put it in your  head and that way  you can kind of  almost live with  them  vicariously through  their other half  of the brain  and then all kinds  of drama happens  lesbian  it's so off the  wall  it kind of makes  sense in a weird  way  it does  his stuff does  it almost makes  sense if you're  completely insane  sometimes there's  something that gets  through to you  that you start  you start to think  damn it  he's got a point  there  that's really  distressing  he might have  something there 
[02:51:30]  wow so yeah  you just kind of  found him  and now  sending him  around the world  which  god damn  he hated it  he hated every  moment  he hated India  he said of India  it's the worst  place on the world  couldn't find any  redeeming value  in India at all  he said of the  great pyramids  it just looks like  a game of Jenga  that got out of hand  I like when he's  talking about  Australia  and how he hates  Australia  because there's so  many deadly  creatures there  and then his  logic as to why 
[02:52:00]  there were so  many deadly  creatures  was that a lot  of these bugs  and what not  live under rocks  and since Australia  is on the bottom  of the earth  which is in  essence just a  giant rock  that they live  under there  and Ricky had to  point out there  is no up or down  it's all relative  and you couldn't  really get that  point  yeah kind of  like big  concepts  yeah  for years  we tried to  explain to him  that idea  that if you  take an  infinite number  of monkeys  infinite number  of typewriters  one of them  eventually will  type the complete  works of Shakespeare  just that's the  nature of infinity  but he just 
[02:52:30]  starts saying  okay have they  read Shakespeare  no they haven't  read Shakespeare  it's totally  random  to be or not  to  does that count  no it has to  be the full  sentence  you really send  the guy and  then you animated  the show around  him going around  the world  no sorry  these are two  different shows  we should make  that clear  one is a live  action show  where he gets  sent around  the world  he's Carl  you're looking  at the American  Carl right here  Steven you see  that list of  words those are  all the words 
[02:53:00]  he has mispronounced  on our radio  we keep track  and we have about  another seven to  add today alone  and he only does  the show once  a month  no every two  weeks but I kill  on stage  fucking kill on  stage  but you know  they're real  ticklers when it  comes to wording  ticklers  ticklers  sticklers  perfect  there you go  this is what we  know the fiend  better  put the ticklers  up there on the  list  and what was that  movie you saw  recently  I fucked that up  lost in  oh  well I said it 
[02:53:30]  wrong  what did you say  what did you say  so I said lost  in translation  but it's translation  lost in translation  lost in trans-Asian  which is  trans-Asian  but you know  sometimes you know  you're talking fast  you gotta get words  and you fuck up  every now and then  what about when  he mixed up frugal  with uh  what was the other  one Danny  he wanted to say  frugal  no  frivolous  and frugal  which frivolous  and frugal  two opposite things 
[02:54:00]  so it came out  frugalous  it's early too  you know  oh yeah  that's why  he should have  flooped the coop  like you said  yeah  they flooped the coop  oh I hate these  ticklers for detail  yes  listen  you guys want  a 9-11 story  what  I just want to  prove my point  all right  why not  do you mind  no go for it  all right  let's say hi  to Stephen Jersey  now this is obviously  a very touchy subject  I understand that  but with every tragedy  there's somebody going  holy crap  this really helped 
[02:54:30]  out my situation  that's all I'm saying  with that Stephen  go ahead  hey guys  uh  make a long story  by the way  enough time  goes by  and uh  like the Titanic  they'll make a  fucking kiddie ride  out of it  they put in the  back uh  yards at parties  you ever see that  let's just say  my name is Stephen  let's just assume  I'm from Jersey  okay  uh  I slept with my wife's  sister  uh  we got drunk  one night  we slept together  and this was like  in July  she proceeded to  tell me about 
[02:55:00]  August the 20th  that she was  pregnant  she was also  married  so she was  trying to figure  out how to  tell her husband  I was trying to  figure out how  to tell my wife  and she died  in the trade  center tower  so nothing  nothing was  ever said  well lucky  for you  that's what  I'm getting at  and you thought  this was a good  idea to phone  a radio station  it's been long  enough now  my wife can  deal with this  information now  this is the way  to break it to her  they're currently  in the car  and his wife  is listening  I'm sure he 
[02:55:30]  didn't want  the person to  die  but what I'm  saying is  it was a huge  relief as far  as the situation  he was in  let's say my  name is Steve  and not disguise  my voice  at all  it was kind  of emotional  but it was  happy and it  was sad too  at the same  token  I'm sure  there's worse  stories than  that  that's sort  of what I'm  getting at  that's an  extraordinary  story  thank you  Steve  let's go to  Steve in  South Dakota  Steve  hey guys  what's going  on  hey buddy  we got  Steven Merchant  in studio 
[02:56:00]  Steven  on extras  there was  a line  that you  had  when Ricky  was in  a play  and he  introduced  you to  one of  the  midgets  that was  in the  play  you walk  up  and you  just go  Ricky  introduced  you  and you  go  midget  and you  shake  his  hand  yes  I  remember  in television  and then  you proceed  to go  where do  you buy  your clothes  from a  baby store  you live 
[02:56:30]  in a  small house  where I  could be  like a  giant  I've had  tears  rolling  rolling  down  my  face  one  of  the  best  for  10  seconds  on  television  ever  that's  very  sweet  of you  thank you  how does that relate to 9-11 stores  no we don't want a lot of those  I was just trying to make a little point  today  I mean that's a horrible area to go down  we talked to Ricky about  this  those shows  the shows that you've done  The Office and Extras 
[02:57:00]  just a few episodes  like and then  you just decide to not do anymore  well I should point out that in the UK  firstly you don't have the big teams of writers like you do in the US  it's just me and Ricky making those shows  and we get bored quickly  we get tired quickly  we get sick of each other quickly  and also there's no sort of economic incentive to keep it going  because it's not like you can kind of do enough and get syndicated  so you may as well call it quits and make something new  and also I think it's partly that impulse as well to just not burn out an idea 
[02:57:30]  and it gets to that later stage where  I used to love Roseanne but towards the end  it kind of got tricky  John Goodman was clearly away making movies  because he'd be like  where's dad?  he's working out of town  for the next five weeks  we talk about that all the time  all the sitcoms where they can't sign everybody  so you get like  they do the phone call  it's like hey Richie's calling from school  hi  and then obviously 
[02:58:00]  and then contractual obligation  they have to do a split screen of him  like in a studio somewhere  yeah I'm having fun at college  yeah and he's clearly got a different haircut  and a beard that he's got for the next movie role  he's holding the phone in the 50s wearing a digital watch  he just doesn't give a shit  oh that's so true  oh yeah  I love the idea that Henry Winkler never left  like everyone it seemed left that show  beginning to end  I'm still here  I'm sticking it out  I don't care  I'm 50 years old 
[02:58:30]  I'm going to be a teenager  the teen  I'm going to be the raucous teenager  did you ever see the Happy Days episode  there's a couple that stick with me  one where he goes blind  yes  he had to put his motorcycle together  motorcycle back together while blind  I missed the beginning  so I don't know why he was blind  or why the motorcycle was in different pieces  but there's also one where he solves racism  in the deep south  no  in the deep south  do you remember this  I remember the one where he solved racism  or tried to solve racism  when I think Styx was coming over 
[02:59:00]  to Richie's house for the party  and everybody at Arnold's didn't want to go to the party  because there was a black guy at Richie's house  so Fonz told me  you're all going to be there  and when Fonzie left  he expected everyone to be there  and they all went  I'm not going  and it was the first time  like Arnold's turned against Fonzie  wow  and didn't fucking listen to the Fonz  and he did that in a deep shot  you can't even do that within yourself  and he had no  not my house  but what I saw was where he  some friend is  or Richie's is going to the south  to be like on a march 
[02:59:30]  you know civil rights march  so the Fonz goes there  but obviously they can't afford  to stage an entire march  so it mainly takes place  in like this diner  where the guy who runs it  is like a real racist  and so Fonz walks in with this black dude  and there's a sign that sort of says  no blacks  and it ends with Fonzie  like making some speech  hitting the counter  the sign falls down  and the audience  erupts into applause  it's like  okay no this is on a lot  in a studio today  this is not really a deep sign  it's not real  he's not really a racist  can we try to find this clip 
[03:00:00]  if it's short  I gotta see it  I don't remember this one  wow  it's so good  and the waitress who's there  goes I've learned a lesson  and she changes her opinion  and she quits the job  just like that  it happens so quickly  and it's probably  it was such a realistic  and the whole time  there it is  is that it there  whites only  let it rip  let's hear his speech  let's make them signs  come out  come out  come out  come out  I'll see you later Nick 
[03:00:30]  whites only  the sign goes down  the sign goes down  the whole time  they still hate Jews  there goes the neighborhood  Fonzie didn't care about that  Fonzie came back  wrote no Jews  and hung that up  boy  they really  ran out of ideas  wow  I was talking to someone  yesterday about the  I'm sure you've talked about it  before  the pedophile episode  of Different Strokes  oh yeah  it's just  I could not watch it  I could not get through it 
[03:01:00]  we only watched that one  it's the only one  worth watching  oh wow  it's very sexy  it's so bad  it's so creepy  and considering it's  the guy from WKRP  you know  it's right  it's just like  but it's just the idea  that there's like  200 episodes in now  and the writers  just think that  we're invincible  you know what we should  try and solve  kiddie fiddling  we should wipe that out  we've got a platform  here guys  I just want to laugh  I don't want to think  there's much  that was the era  the 80s and shit  was the era  of the very special episode 
[03:01:30]  right  they would call it that  they would say  this Sunday  a very special episode  and they would handle  drug abuse  and it became like  it wasn't a sitcom anymore  that's what's interesting  about the pedophile one  is that it starts off  with the usual kind of jokes  and the audience is laughing  and then it's like  to get creepier  and there's still like  there's like still one dude  who like  yeah  and claps  and then realizes  okay no this is getting  really intense now  but it's like  they're still trying  to laugh and enjoy it  but it's just really sinister  where like the old dude  takes a kid into a room 
[03:02:00]  it's like  should we be laughing  it started  that started off  I think with  Norman Lear shows  in the 70s  I remember Good Times  and All in the Family too  they would have  these episodes  that would end  and it wouldn't have  the nice music  and the applause  of the audience  it would end  with just the credits  going over silence  but the TVs  were so bad back then  and the white background  you'd hear like  bop  bop  bop  bop  every time 
[03:02:30]  different letters  came up  the credits  and it was supposed  to leave you  in like this depressed mood  it was horrible  so bizarre  they were the worst  episodes ever  it's like  oh  and like they'd get  a phone call  it's like  what hello  yes  he is  I just got a call  he's dead  bop  bop  bop  bop  when they run out  of ideas  they have to go  to the  I guess you know  6-12 episodes  this is another concern  you know  we were worried  that we would be 
[03:03:00]  dealing  if we carried on  the office  our British version  we'd have had  like David Bread  molesting someone  you know  down the road  so  oh you've got it  on the web  it's too much  I cannot  he's just pulled up  this paedophile episode  and it's me  he makes me  it really is  I still remember  there's a moment  where he makes them  watch a cartoon  that's kind of  the implication  that it's like  a porno cartoon  he's just trying  to be one of the kids  quack quack  oh  it's really making me 
[03:03:30]  it is uncomfortable  because he's such  a race traitor  oh Jesus  it's smart  so we'll look him over  maybe we'll play  a little video game  later on  he's pulling what  we call the old  Mark Parenteau  yeah  ah look  look at these  he's making them  thumb through  nudie magazines  what you looking at  yeah  you think we should  look at this one  of course  why are people laughing  the audience is so  unsure  they're just  oh you guys  were looking at this  there's nothing wrong 
[03:04:00]  with being naked  there's nothing to be ashamed of  the point is  Arnold  there's a good reason  for looking at the human body  and admiring it  yeah  it's a work of art  oh you've got to switch this off  it makes me  it's so uncomfortable  Steve is really uncomfortable  not only is it bringing back  a lot of memories  oh shit  you know guys  you can just have an awful lot  of fun with your clothes off  oh my god  this is terrible  it's so intense  well for instance 
[03:04:30]  there's skinny dipping  yeah  but this guy ever worked again  I know  you guys better love them  I mean  Gary  here they are right here  oh Jesus  here we are  down at the old waterhole  look at us  old Polaroids  you don't have any clothes on either  I like the fact that  this pedophile though  he's like  he's really thought this through  like he's got some nudie magazines  a cartoon  he's really gone out of ways  he's got the kid 
[03:05:00]  he's got the pedophile kit  he's well prepared  yeah  yeah he's really good at it  just a sip  uh oh  the juice  give him a little booze  oh  oh  Jesus  that's gonna fucking  give me a cool  rainy day like today  huh  you know  we ought to be playing some games  oh shit  this is just creepy  all right  please switch it off  all right  enough  oh come on  I didn't finish  I didn't finish  Arnold's friend doesn't have his shirt off yet 
[03:05:30]  that part comes with  the problem with him  is he got greedy  he tries  you can't get two at one  two at a time  three  I dreamt of a threesome  but I'm not  oh you  oh  what the fuck  wow  kids 80s  my concern is that  pedophiles were at home  watching this  yeah  and getting off  yeah  exactly  take some pictures  and we're gonna have  no room  sniffing wine  we're gonna take some more pictures  give me a strike a pose for me  he's using all my lines  from my house  we're gonna have some wine 
[03:06:00]  take some pictures  it's gonna be great  we're just gonna have a great time together  this afternoon  oh  oh boy  oh it's gross  why don't I be the lion  and you take the pictures  desperate was this actor  that he agreed to do this role  I know  I know  when that script landed  oh he's right now  oh jeez  there we go  Rich you do this  sorry I don't have a tail  for you to hang on to  that's okay  you can just wag you behind  in the audience  Orange is still laughing  the audience hasn't figured out  what's going on yet 
[03:06:30]  no  they're just going  what a lovely guy  he's giving him some wine  free  you know wine's expensive  but  he's bought the magazines  what a dude  he took the white  he's just a really hospitable  he's a really hospitable hoaxer  what a sick fucking show  that was awful  so now they're jumping on a couch  sorry we had to leave  without saying goodbye Curly  we looked out the peephole  and saw it was my dad 
[03:07:00]  he doesn't even suspect  that you were here  you know  I feel funny about all the sneaking  around  oh don't worry about it  it's not sneaking around  we're just  simply trying to keep me  out of trouble  for giving you guys  all these little treats  after school  that's my man  huh  alright fellas  in the way we go  doing Gleason jokes  okay guys  here it is  it's a show time  and a pie time  good afternoon  ladies and gentlemen  it's time for  Curly's Cartoon Cavalcade 
[03:07:30]  no  oh it's where he's showing  the pornographic cartoons  check him out  Arnold just did a crazy look  because he's still there  he's just lost his pants  Dully  this is an X-rated cartoon  where did he get  X-rated cartoons  it's not  do you want to play  the web  video store  this is like pre  pre the web as well  yeah  you know like nowadays  if you're a pedophile  you can get  X-rated 
[03:08:00]  kitty fiddling cartoons  and you know  you know  hunt that shit down  that's true  like I mean that actor  like who the fuck  because that ruins careers  of course it does  that ruins fucking  the next day  after that aired  did he leave the house  hey did you see me  last night  I was good  wasn't it  there was a guy  that was on  Mary Teller Moore  he was a regular  and then he did  a pedophile fucking movie  like a kids  you know  after school special  yeah  he never fucking  worked together  fucking he was done  it was done  yeah  that's a bad agent  you got a  bad agent right there 
[03:08:30]  oh good  now I feel really unclean  I know  I'm looking  it just feels like  I'm just thinking  one of you might be  yeah yeah  look who came up  with it really fast  now they start  pointing fingers  at each other  with this show  it has to be  I want to  I know you've been  asked a lot  but you ever  do that  with children  no  the Ricky Gervais 
[03:09:00]  on the Golden Globes  right  what's the real story  there  and I think  it's what Ricky said  like everybody  had a great time  with it  but the news  why would they  why would they  try to make it  seem like  a lot of people  were upset  why would  okay  why would the news  want to make it  seem like  there was a story  let's just sit  and think about  that one for a moment  I just said  something really stupid  what are you  fucking me  yes  what I don't  I think the story  is that  everyone was  really offended  and he was off  air for an hour  because he was 
[03:09:30]  being told off  I was back there  with him  no one came back  in fact they were rude  they didn't even  come back and say hi  but they certainly  didn't come back  and tell him off  were people offended  I don't know  maybe  they seemed to be  laughing as much  as they were  oohing and aahing  I don't know  it seems like  someone's manufactured  a story out of this  yeah  because it was  the only reason  I watched it  it was coming on  and I said  I want to see this  because Ricky Gervais  is hosting it  that's the only reason  I'm watching  who gives a shit  about the Golden Globes 
[03:10:00]  and that's why  I watched it  and then to see  all the flack  the next day  it's like  but that's what  you're getting  do you know  Ricky Gervais  I don't also  I really  genuinely don't  think Bruce Willis  is offended  if you make a joke  about it  he's Bruce Willis  yeah I don't think  he may die hard  that's enough  it's like  this is the thing  I just don't buy  this idea  that everyone's  devastated  and weeping  into their  into their coffee  the next day  I just don't buy it  you know  they're movie stars  they're millionaires  they've won 
[03:10:30]  the lottery of life  yeah  you know  here's the thing  they fucking win  the lottery  now they're giving  themselves awards  for winning  the fucking lottery  you know  enough already  when I was a writer  on the Oscars  for Chris  okay  that would be  Chris Rocks  it was a lose  lose situation  I thought it was  like a party  an Oscar party  yeah  no but it was  a lose lose  in my opinion  because if he  wasn't edgy enough  then his fans  are going  oh look  he watered it down  you know  and if he was  too watered down 
[03:11:00]  then it's not right  you know  if you're gonna get him  that's what you're getting  yeah  okay  so deal with it  that's what Ricky  decided to do  he did such a good job  because yeah  he went after people  it was funny  it was genuinely fun  and people are saying  they haven't watched  an awards show  and actually laughed  at the host  in years  right  and it's funny  in a way  that he  not only is he  the one that people  are talking about  after the event  none of the award winners  but normally as well  the Golden Globes  is normally  the conversation's dead  after people have  dissected their dresses  they're still talking 
[03:11:30]  about it like a week later  so surely it's good  for the Globe  I had a two  I had a two  two winner parlay  on the Golden Globes  oh Jesus  I think that  that's a gambling bet  not a good one  no not a good  anything  that was  that wasn't a very  I'm fucking  8 for  8 for  390%  or whatever  yeah they're fucking  Golden Globes  anyhow  you know  what the fuck  no one  you're right  this is also  this is the weirdest  thing for me  we did the show  extras  we talked about earlier  that was a show  that seemed to be  trying to skewer  a celebrity  trying to laugh 
[03:12:00]  at the kind of  you know  much as we  I love movies  I love movie  I've worked with people  in movies myself  I enjoy the process  of it  but you know  we were sort of  laughing at the people  who take themselves  too seriously  the pomposity  the arrogance  the ego  they gave us  a Golden Globe  for that show  you know what I mean  that's what's weird  wait a minute  you obviously  identified  with what we were doing  and now we come  on the show  and he does it  because that's real  I don't know  the actor's name  it doesn't even matter  but he was doing  this like  public announcement 
[03:12:30]  you know  whatever to do  about racism  and you know  and we all got to  get along  and he was gay  and the whole thing  and then I saw  one at a comedy club  cracking up  at one of the most  racist comics  up there  sitting there  you know what I mean  so just complete  fucking hypocrisy  coming out of there  well a lot of people  are full of shit  they are  that's the word  but you know  bear in mind  we're bad-mouthing  we're bad-mouthing  like the stars  and stuff  like they've been  I don't think  they are  I don't think  they are either  they're publicists  right  so I don't know  who it is  I think also 
[03:13:00]  you know  this is the nature  of Twitter  and online now  is you can generate  a story  make up news  yeah  apparently Piers Morgan  someone just told me  Piers Morgan  apparently claims  to have generated  the where did Ricky  go for an hour  story  probably because he knows  Ricky's on his show  tonight  yeah  very smart  speaking of Ricky too  he's going to make  a cameo in the  American office  what can you tell us  about that  I don't want to  give anything away  I know  I know  but it's our job  to at least try a little  it's going to be  pretty exciting  I'm just going to go  silent and make  an awkward silence  yeah  everyone's very excited 
[03:13:30]  very excited  that he's doing  a little cameo  he wouldn't do  anything to destroy  the character  or anything  he touches  Michael Scott  inappropriately  oh that's good  he takes his shirt off  and he actually  rides on Ricky's back  when you say  everybody's excited  what do you mean  like the whole  country  fuck yeah man  I mean are you saying  people that know  it's funny rich  I don't know  how many people  did you watch  the British office  yeah I have it at home  I'm not going to lie 
[03:14:00]  fucking extras  was one of my  favorite shows  then we started  watching the office  my wife bought it  but my hearing  I couldn't keep up  with it  I'm not  I'm not going to  I couldn't keep up  with it  subtitles  I couldn't keep up  you got a new TV  where they do the  subtitles for you  no  I just was trying  to listen  we have it  all I know is  two of my favorite  shows  if you don't  understand  you can put  the English  subtitles on  on the DVD  on the DVD 
[03:14:30]  when I get home  tonight I'll start  I didn't know that  I didn't know that  he's our Carl  I'm telling you  we gotta send him  around the world  you've achieved  your goals  listen  the other show  from England  is the one  where the guy  was a radio host  and then he went  and fucking  brought him in  I fucking  I watched  three or four episodes  I couldn't fucking  stop laughing  that has nothing  to do with him  I'm just saying  it doesn't matter  really  so you're saying  the pedophile  thing has something  to do with him  but you're basically  saying the show  that you  just helped create  England 
[03:15:00]  helped create  I haven't seen you  no I haven't  I couldn't  you can't understand  we're getting credit  for Mission Impossible  because it was made  in the United States  I said  who brought up  extras first here  me  I brought it up  guys let's not  fight  let's not squabble  that's all  fuck that  listen to me  you want to see  something Stephen  describe one episode  of extras  to Stephen Merchant  one lousy episode  where Ricky's character  where Ricky's character  was struggling  struggling as an actor  he finally gets 
[03:15:30]  he finally hits  and gets shit going  for him  and he dumps  his best friend  and then he realizes  in life  that friendship  means more  than fucking  the dumb  entertainment business  oh my god  you're right  that was an episode  and we are  as moralizing  as different strokes  that was a special  you just described  a very special  I get to take  three words  off of that list  that's a long way  I told Rich  you gotta make  a book out of that  that was an episode 
[03:16:00]  yeah  that was an episode  very special  had a little bit  of morality  I didn't realize  it was that facile  the show  I know right  wow it's like  a kids program  describes it  unbelievable  so what are we  promoting today Stephen  well we talked  about the  we talked about  the two Carl shows  there's one on  Science Channel  on Saturday  that's where we  send it around  the world  there's one on  Friday nights  on HBO  that's the  animated thing  we should mention  Hall Pass  this movie I did  with Owen Wilson  I haven't seen it yet  so I don't know  if it's any good  but it's coming out  in February  and there's probably 
[03:16:30]  some other stuff  is it better than  the Fockers movie  the Fockers movie  I didn't see that one  good  see  I thought  The Parents was great  I loved The Parents  the first one was really good  and then again  just getting greedy  and keep it going  and  Ocean's 18  did you see  Winner's Bone  Winner's Bone  yeah  no  is that a porno  it's great  no it's a fucking  great movie  you've been saying  Winner's Bone  and it's actually  Winner's Bone  Winner's  like the  you said Winners  W-I-N-T-E-R-S 
[03:17:00]  Winner's Bone  I've heard it's really good  it's fucking great  yeah  and they  you know  they're like  I'm trying to sound  cultured  are you kidding me  you know the culture  I have  I've been all over  I've been  I've performed in  England  fucking Holland  Scotland  I'm all over  Hong Kong  fucking big act  I was  I was big  fucking four years ago  four years ago  when I was peaking man  let me fucking tell you something  we were all  we all had our peak  oh fuck man  let me tell you  when I'm  oh  it was so good 
[03:17:30]  there's real anger in you  over here  everyone's bitter in this room  everyone's bitter  yeah  do you know John Feeley  comedian in England  no I don't know  he owes me 300 bucks  you know Stephen did stand up  that's how I met Ricky too  did you do stand up  I do do stand up  but I didn't  do you still do it as much  yeah I started  went back  went back to it  I stopped it for a while  it's hard stand up  oh I did that  fucking jonglers in Camden  oh that's a brutal place  you know I'm over there  so they put  you know I'm the  fucking American  on the show  alright I got one 
[03:18:00]  strike against me  and they put on  some American  open miker  right before me  he fucking  and now our next  American  it was fucking  and this room  it's I think  Camden or something  it's like a fucking  knife fight  to begin with  alright  it was a knife fight  I mean  no those places are brutal  it's people who've just come in  they're all beard up  before they even start  you know it's like  bachelor parties and stuff  and the people who run them  aren't even  I don't think they care about  the comedy  it's just  half the people there  don't even want to be there 
[03:18:30]  it's a fucking  wow  sounds like a great place  horrific  we did that show over there  called The World Stands Up  though  which is pretty cool  you know  comedy specials in England  that was fun  you know the audiences were great  you know it was in a nice theater  and stuff  but some of them  and they looked at  also too  and I didn't realize this  in England  the comics  look down on  comedians that sell  CDs and DVDs  after shows or something  like I was out there  after one of my shows  we look down on you here too  the audience looks like 
[03:19:00]  ugh  are you kidding me  but you weren't selling  your own CDs and DVDs  just something that you brought over  that you want to get rid of  the office  I can't understand this crap  all bootleg copies  of everyone else's work  yeah  I got a bootleg  off the TV  yeah I got a bootleg  VHS  of different strokes  Carol Channing  oh  have we run out of steam guys  I feel like your energy's waned  no  no  it's time to get the fuck out of here 
[03:19:30]  oh it is  okay  two years ago  that's what we try to tell you  when you got in here  so we're just filling now  we just punch clock  we're just filling up  the next couple of minutes  before you have to go up there  fill it up  fill her up  we just filled for the last  four hours  that's what we care about  yeah the whole show is filler  really  when you think about it  is anyone listening to this  nah  probably not  what kind of audience  is he game  like that old guy  that had the black kid  on his back  people that  people that don't read  ingredients on food 
[03:20:00]  okay  just a bunch of  fucking  hemoglobins  we've been out  and met our audience  scum  for the most part  huge  they don't take care  of themselves  physically very well  the guys don't have  girlfriends  the girls don't have  boyfriends  actually the girl  doesn't have a boyfriend  parents drop them off  at the events  yeah  it's real  it really is awful  because they have too many  DUIs under their belt  but they are whizzes  on the computer  they sure are 
[03:20:30]  if you give them  your password  they will fucking  they hate to a point  you don't even realize  they're fans  they're brilliant at it  they're brilliant at their  hitting  the real true comedy fans  that come out to the clubs  really know  they're really good fans  like the ones that will  come next week  to see me  the ones that will see me  in Boca  at the Funky Buddha  or this weekend  in Harrisburg  at the Comedy Zone  the ones that will see me  in Harrisburg  are fucking great  okay  those are my favorites  the guy  when I was in  fucking  I was in Rhode Island 
[03:21:00]  over the weekend  and let me tell you  I can't tell you  how arrogant they were  about the Patriots  no I was fighting  two guys in the audience  I made a joke  I walked on stage  saying  oh you did  Tom Brady  broke his ankle  or this and that  you know  that was a joke  before  no no no  hold on  no I started  listen  Jesus Christ  Tom Brady  brings ankle  this and that  yeah  yeah man  you say it  woo  no  let me rephrase 
[03:21:30]  I opened the show  you know  by saying  I got bad news  because there are  big Patriot fans  up there  football  we play here  and  they're real  they were so arrogant  up there  about the Patriots  two guys walked out  because I was  smashing the Patriots  this is before the game  they fucking said  fuck you  fuck you  and they walked out  so we get that part of it  okay  I don't know  where I was going  with the story  this is all filler  listen  so there's  an idiot abroad  that's on  Science Channel  on Saturday  that's on HBO 
[03:22:00]  on Fridays  I'm out of here  you're going to be  a voice in  Portal 2  that video game  yeah I'm a voice  in Portal 2  for any computer dudes  I love the first one  it's fucking fantastic  I did that  I'm looking for the  second one  you were in the first one  no  I just did the voice  for the  for the second one  the voice of a robot  that guides you around  that is hard work  man  have you ever done  a voice for a computer game  yeah yeah  a few of them  oh wow  yeah you spent hours  not down there  down here  you're yelling  you gotta yell 
[03:22:30]  and  yeah we did a bunch  of voices for  Grand Theft Auto  oh you did  yeah  oh are you the DJs  on there  nah  we're the assholes  is there DJs  I was like the guy  that sells guns  and  then I was a cop  and  it's just funny shit  though  you gotta yell  hey don't touch me  is this me in the  community  oh is this you  oh for gods  they told me  that if I ever  turned this flashlight on  I would die  they told me that  about everything  I mean I don't even  know why they  bothered giving me  this stuff  if they didn't  want me to use it  it's pointless  mad 
[03:23:00]  I mean that's  the sort of stuff  you've got to listen to  for hours  at a time  when you're playing  this game  because I keep  saying to them  it's not going  to get irritating  is it  I play a video game  but it's fine  for the first 10 minutes  and then like  when you keep going  back to the same level  because you can't get  through  it's still me again  same jokes  I hate those games  you can't just hit  the save button  real quick  like you get past  the point  and go  save  that way I don't  have to do that  again  it's like oh  you've got to  pass a checkpoint  fuck the checkpoint  I'm a big gamer 
[03:23:30]  you play games  I used to  but then I sort of  realized that one of  the reasons I wasn't  getting girls  was I was spending  too much time  playing games  keep telling yourself  this is rare  that it's  that might have  been a joke  there it was  he's biding his time  he wasn't going to  let the crack  I made earlier  go by  without revenge  he could have  waited  for days  you're sitting  and waiting  don't you think  I would have  drove home  in my car  thinking  what should I  say  is this how  quick you are  when there's 
[03:24:00]  a heckler  at a club  say that again  in 40 minutes  I'm going to be  back here  in a month's time  you come back  and you say  he tells the  10 o'clock show  what he would have  told the guy  let's get the  fuck out of here  that's what I say  Steven Merchant  we're all huge fans  thank you man  thank you for stopping by  say hi to Ricky  I think Ricky's coming on  in a few weeks  to do our show as well  but I think we talked  over your plug  the Ricky Gervais show  Fridays at 9 on HBO  and Carl's show
