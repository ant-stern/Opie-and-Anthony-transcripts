<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "Worst of the Week" countdown hosted by Sam Roberts, featuring clips from the week's broadcasts.  These included discussions about teachers having inappropriate relationships with students and celebrity appearances/calls.  Hugh Jackman discussed auditioning for *Beauty and the Beast*, his Wolverine training regimen, and the infamous Rob Lowe Snow White Oscars performance.  Paul Williams received a birthday call from Opie.  Ron Artest (Metta World Peace) also called in.  Comedian Michael Shea was a guest in the studio, along with Tony Saragusa, who promoted his Depends adult underwear commercials, drawing comparisons to other athlete endorsements, particularly Bill Cowher’s.  The show highlighted a public access television show, "Stairway to Stardom," featuring incredibly bad singers, comedians, and impressionists, with particular attention given to Jimmy Schwartzman's performance of "Come to the Cabaret" and Precious Pat’s disastrous song. Comedian Don Costello's interview was also featured.

A significant portion of the show featured Stalker Patty’s return, focusing on her twerking video.  Extensive efforts were made to encourage her to twerk on camera, with discussions about wardrobe and technique improvements culminating in a filmed performance. Comedian Michael Chea discussed his difficult early life, including being kicked out of his house at 14.  Numerous commercial breaks occurred throughout this segment, advertising life insurance, protein supplements, network security, and other products.

The show also included an interview with comedian Bonnie McFarlane. She recounted a negative experience with Air Canada, detailing her denied boarding despite having proper documentation. This led to a discussion of her comedy style, tattoos, and a running joke involving a double insult.  Unexpectedly, Dominic, the Cronut creator, appeared in the studio during the Hugh Jackman interview, offering Cronuts and a new pastry, a "magic souffle," to Jackman and the hosts.

A later segment featured Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane, along with the hosts, engaging in a highly offensive discussion about the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), criticizing Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga's performances and attire using extremely vulgar and racially charged language.  This evolved into a heated argument between Vos and McFarlane about household chores, cleanliness, their house being for sale, and past cleaning-related incidents.  The segment promoted their podcast, "My Wife Hates Me," and included numerous ad reads for SiriusXM, Dollar Shave Club, Rosetta Stone, MissTravel.com, and Bonefish Grill. Rich Vos also mentioned not receiving a promised *Breaking Bad* jacket and a confrontation with a woman at a pool regarding an inflatable toy.  Throughout this segment, highly offensive and racially charged language was used.

It's the Worst of the Week Countdown.  As the intro told you, I'm Sam Roberts from Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:03:00]  And what a week to highlight for you.  Huh?  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  We bring you all the greatest moments that happened this week, and it was a hell of a week of radio.  We went through a list of teachers who slept with their students.  We had Hugh Jackman in studio.  We called Paul Williams on his birthday.  We had Metta World Peace, a.k.a. Ron Artest, on the phone.  Comedian Michael Shea in studio.  Stalker Patty made her return.  Jesus Christ, we'll get to all of it before we start any of that. 
[00:03:30]  Tony Saragusa was in studio.  So, the goose is always a good guest on the Opie and Anthony show, but this is the first time he's been in since he started selling Depends Undergarments for Men.  I wonder if that comes up at all.  Tony Saragusa in studio on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I've got to say, you're a great spokesperson, because we were just talking about Bill Cowher and how awful he is with the Time Warner commercials. 
[00:04:00]  And you probably don't want to say anything, but, you know, some of these athletes don't really have any business being on commercials.  And some of the athletes you think are going to be horrible are unbelievable, like the Mattings.  I think they do an unbelievable job with a lot of their commercials.  They're a bit on the dry side, but it works.  Yeah, but the dry humor works.  Right.  I mean, dry humor works.  But Bill Cowher cannot deliver a line in those Time Warner commercials.  Oh, it's brutal.  But they're using it.  What were they thinking? 
[00:04:30]  Big, big, big, you know, big Steeler fans.  A Time Warner cable.  You're right.  You know what?  That's what it is.  Hey, guys.  A guy who runs is probably a big Steeler fan.  You're not.  Absolutely.  What are you kidding me?  The CEO's like, I love the Steelers.  I want to get a sideline pass.  Hire Cowher.  Put him on a couch.  Come and give him a couple lines.  That's how that works.  The next time you just see him there, you know, just, you know, usually they give him a whistle.  Come on, work out.  And they have all these guys in this, like, strange color, so they don't identify with any NFL players.  With any team, really.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You deliver a line very well.  Yeah.  You're very natural. 
[00:05:00]  Well.  But sports figures, for the most part, yeah, they have a problem.  Yeah, there's been a few over the years.  Dating back to, you know, fucking Joe Namath when he was hanging out with the Bradys.  Hey, Bobby.  They analyze things too much.  Hey, Bobby, let me pass the ball to you.  Right.  But they got Joe Namath.  Yeah, they got Joe Namath.  That's all they cared about.  We got Joe Namath on the Brady Bunch.  Yeah.  That's true.  You were fucking 97-1 as a wrestler?  Yeah.  That is amazing as a record.  Why not the Olympics? 
[00:05:30]  Nah, nah.  It was pretty funny.  I went to Pitt, and they had a pretty good wrestler up there, and I used to wrestle a little bit,  but then they wouldn't let you go and wrestle on the team because football was giving you a scholarship.  I liked wrestling.  I think wrestling really helped you become a better football player.  You know, with keeping your base down low, leverage, working guys real tight to another guy.  Right.  I think it's a great sport.  You know what the thing about wrestling is?  You know, it's a one-on-one, and you can't point your finger at nobody else.  It's, all right, listen.  It's you against him.  He's the same weight.  Usually, he's around the same age. 
[00:06:00]  Get out there.  Let's see what you can do.  And, you know, I coach my son in wrestling, and I think it's a great sport.  Is he good?  Self-motivation.  Yeah.  He's pretty good?  Yeah, he's good.  How many sports did you play in high school?  Well, I played, I was a football, obviously.  A wrestler?  A wrestler, baseball.  I did track.  It was pretty funny.  It's a great story.  So, I'm a junior, and I'm, like, in the States, you know, and I'm throwing a shot put and a discus,  and I'm chucking this thing around, you know, I'm wearing the nut hugger shorts and all that kind of, you know,  hey, you know, back in the day with the big tube socks. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  But, and all of a sudden, I come to my senior year, and I'm, like, dude, you know what, man,  and I'm evaluating my life.  I'm, like, you know, I'm going to get a scholarship, maybe, you know, go to Pitt, and, you know,  I want to be a multimillionaire, dude.  I want to have millions.  And I don't know any multimillionaire that, like, get his buddies, and they go throw the shot put or the disc.  So, shit, I joined a golf team.  No kidding.  Jeez.  Yeah, Baltus Roll was one of our courses that we played, you know, in Jersey, and went over to Galloping Hill,  and went on the golf team.  My coach comes up to me.  He goes, you know, what are you doing?  I go, he goes, you can probably win the stage. 
[00:07:00]  I go, yeah, but, you know, what am I, I don't want to be throwing a piece of lead around.  No, God.  He probably had a nervous breakdown.  Oh, yeah, right.  He probably cried hard.  You know, my job's on the line, my 1,200 bucks for coaching.  Right, exactly.  You know, but it was.  Oh, yeah, it'd be so sad.  Yeah, so I liked everything.  You lost it to golf.  Yeah, I liked everything.  What's your handicap?  Right now, I'm probably about a 9 or 8, somewhere around there.  That means he's a 6 or a 7.  No.  No, but all these guys padded a little bit, you know, for the money. 
[00:07:30]  Depends.  Depends.  Depends.  Hey.  Hey.  Who finally beat you wrestling?  Who did you lose to?  I lost to a kid from Newton in the States.  He actually threw legs in on me, and he was, like, stalling, and it was, like, 10-10.  It was, like, two seconds left on the clock.  What's stalling mean?  What's it mean?  Yeah, he wasn't, like, really doing anything.  He was, like, holding on, so I was, like, getting aggravated.  So I flipped him over, and I grabbed his ankle, and I put my elbow in his shin, and I tried  to break his leg.  And, you know, he started screaming, and they gave me a stalling point. 
[00:08:00]  So I lost 11-10 with, like, two seconds left, and I was pissed.  Hey, listen, man.  He did what he needed to do.  Sometimes stalling is good if you can get away with it.  But, I mean, now it's, like, part of the game, you know, part of the, you know, wrestling.  Go, get, you know, take down, get a couple points, and then, like, try to stay away from  the guy, you know?  It's almost like Spanky, you know, running around the ring trying to run away from him.  Is that finger-in-the-ass move real?  Do they do that?  It's not finger-in-the-ass.  It's sort of like the tailbone.  You know, you put your thumb, like, where the tailbone is, and you lift. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  You know, and usually their legs kick back.  You know, there's little secrets and stuff like that.  You know what I'm saying?  The chin in the back.  What'd you got?  Did you play in the athletics?  Nothing!  Oh, you were the guy smoking a bone back in the car?  Yes, exactly.  I was a degenerate.  I was basketball on track, yeah.  There you go.  What'd you do on track?  About two-mile indoor.  Yeah?  A miserable race and cross-country, yeah.  I was a really good runner, but going with what you said, I was like, who gives a fuck?  I already know I can run real well. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And so I played basketball, but I never got the height.  I was really serious about my basketball.  Point guard?  Oh, yeah.  Shoot the lights out of the ball.  Went to all the camps.  Did you still play a little bit, or no?  Not really.  No, I got too herniated to this.  I get out there almost a while, but I went to the basketball camps all summer, all that  shit.  I was convinced I was going to make it.  Probably kept you out of trouble, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was a rat.  I did about six hours a day.  Easy.  That's awesome.  Easy for most of my years.  Track's a great sport, too, man.  It just bored me, and I was good at it.  And my basketball coach was even saying, man, you know, because when we used to have to  do the two-mile for the basketball team, I would just fucking destroy people. 
[00:09:30]  Nothing in the...  You did fall track, or no?  You didn't do anything in the fall?  No fall.  You looked like maybe you'd be a good little receiver or something like that.  No.  Football scared the shit out of me.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Scared the fuck out of me.  Was it the football, or was it showering with, like, 30 other guys?  No, it was just...  You were a little...  No, I mean, a little thimble.  You have a thimble down there?  Yeah, it's cool.  It's cool.  And it's a thimble that stands up in the shower with other men.  I did go to class sweaty a lot, yes.  There you go.  I didn't feel like showering in front of fucking everybody.  Is that easy to do, just fucking shower in front of everybody? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, it is.  You know, in the beginning, you know, when you're in the NFL, you know, it sort of gets a  little scary.  But there's a few guys with tiny dicks.  I mean, come on.  Oh, there's a couple.  Yeah, but who wants to see fucking Eric Williams or Leon Lett walking in, and you're fucking  making...  Tripod.  ...giants swinging dicks?  Yeah.  We've got to make an extra, a bigger charter, a garter shield for those guys.  I've never really thought about that.  Yeah, right?  We've got to see if we can...  Bigger size for...  Yeah, yeah.  Triple X.  But then who's going to want to buy the normal size?  You're going to be like, yeah.  Imagine buying it in all of a sudden, you know, extra small. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Dekimatsui.  Did you really come up with the product?  Did I come up with the product?  No, no.  They came to me.  They already had the product.  Okay, all right.  They were pretty much established, but I did give my insight on, you know, when we were  doing the commercial, we sat down with everybody, and they were great to work with, but it was,  you know, I sat in a room with, like, maybe 13 women, and it was, like, you know, my agent  and me, and I'm like, listen, they're like, all right, well, this is the way the commercial  is going to go, and I'm like, well, you know what?  You need more guys involved.  You know, you need construction guys.  You need, like, almost, it's, like, no big deal, like, and they were great. 
[00:11:00]  Well, you know, they took my, a little bit of, you know, my insight of what I thought,  you know, how it would make a guy in this situation be as comfortable as he possibly  could, and I thought the commercial came out great.  It's light.  It's fun.  You know, in the beginning, it was crazy.  My Twitter blew up, and I was like, you know, they're, like, killing me, and I'm like,  listen, you know, it's all fun and games until you have to go, and it's you that has to  deal with this, you know what I'm saying?  If we're being honest today, maybe we took a couple of shots. 
[00:11:30]  We took a couple?  We took a couple of shots.  Oh, yeah.  Dude.  But now you're here.  The only thing I ask, whenever you talk, you can rip me on it, just get my name right.  You know what I'm saying?  Tony Saragusa.  I don't care.  We like you, so maybe we should tell you we might have taken him a couple of shots.  That's all.  All in fun.  All in fun, Tony Saragusa.  We just thought it was hilarious, that tiny little man cave thing.  Yeah.  There's a little spot on the bottom.  You see the bobble head?  Yeah.  That was cool, right?  Yeah.  You know, rip it off.  Rip it off.  Tiny little man cave.  Yeah.  Not brave enough to take shots in front of you, but maybe when you're wearing a hair 
[00:12:00]  where you're triggered.  Yeah.  A couple shots.  There you go.  Just a couple.  You know, to keep it real.  Dude, I'm sure that I would be reciprocating if it was the other way.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, when the Depends commercials first started with the women.  That was so creepy.  What was her name when she was on the red carpet and was Harry...  Yeah, it was Harry Hamlin's wife there.  Harry Hamlin's wife there.  And then he's basically going, look how hot she looks.  She's like, I'm wearing...  Lisa Renner.  Yeah, right.  She's like, I'm wearing one right now. 
[00:12:30]  And it's like, oh, Jesus.  And then Harry is there going, look how sexy and hot she is.  And then they changed their tune a little bit and made sure everyone knew that they didn't  actually have to wear these.  And that they were just helping other people to show that you can wear these with a dress  or something.  I think if she fucking put that little amendment into the contract, that's called redlining  it when it went back to the fucking...  Redlining it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is DIY Network?  That's a...  Do-it-yourself it stands for.  Okay.  Oh, right. 
[00:13:00]  Just start another year.  We've done about 150 shows.  Wow.  That's a lot of fucking shows.  Yeah, running a long time.  Good for you.  What exactly do you guys do?  Do you create these or do you go to people's houses and...  We get guys like yourself that have no testosterone in their body and we give them a room that...  I'm only kidding.  Ow!  Like I said, guys like you.  No, but we go to guys' houses and we get a room that their house has completely been taken  over.  I mean, you guys deal with it.  We've done the man cave break on our show. 
[00:13:30]  The one thing we have a problem with is the fact that guys don't want to hang out with  the girls in the man cave.  No?  Can you work that into the show?  Well, we've been doing it.  A lot of times it seems like, you know, they want to escape from, you know, the vaginas to  hang out with the guys and that to us is a little strange.  Well, you know, it depends.  It depends on how long you've been with her.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, that's true.  At some point, you know, you can get a little bit crazy and you've got a little...  You know, guys want to hang out with guys and talk about guy things, you know?  Yeah.  And now you have your own little room, you lock it up. 
[00:14:00]  But we've been doing a lot of celebrities lately.  Charlie Sheen was on last weekend.  We did his house.  I was over his house.  What did you give him that was special?  We gave him like a wine.  He had a room like right next to his pool and we set it up with like wine and cigar.  Like, it was really cool.  That's good for sobriety.  That's good.  Fucking...  You know, we did Snoop's house.  There's still a lot of guys, man.  It's been really nice.  What did you put in Snoop's house?  Well, we put two...  We built him...  He had a shed in his backyard. 
[00:14:30]  And, you know, we tried to...  You know, it's a beautiful view out of his backyard.  And he goes, no windows.  So he didn't want any windows.  He wanted a TV so he could watch his Steelers and play Xbox or whatever it is.  And so we put two 50-inch plasmas, flat screens in.  We cut the back of a 57 Chevy.  We made it a couch so he could hang out there.  We put a table in the front so he could do whatever he does there.  And we put air conditioning in.  So we built him like a mini house in his backyard in a shed dealing with California. 
[00:15:00]  How big is the shed?  Like the size of this room?  A little bit...  About the size of this room.  Maybe a little bit smaller.  Maybe...  So it's a pretty big shed.  Yeah.  Big shed.  And he has like, you know, his fingerprints.  Only he can get into the man cave.  You put your fingerprint down.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  You put your fingerprints.  So we did some really cool stuff with him.  And he's been calling out.  Listen, I got a new studio I'm building.  I need a bunch of guys to come build a new man cave.  And he loves them.  You know, it's great.  So wherever I see him, I get to jump up on stage with him.  And I get in his dog costume.  And I dance around the stage.  Sipping on gin and juice. 
[00:15:30]  And the whole thing.  It was great.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if I want a man cave.  But I don't even know if I want to admit this.  You do, bro.  I want to...  I eventually want to get to the suburbs.  It's a nice big huge house.  Backyard.  And I want to...  So where do you live?  In the city?  Yeah.  Yeah.  With two kids.  With two kids, too?  Yeah.  How old are your kids?  A little over three in almost a year.  Dude, you better start decision-making right now.  No kidding.  We're running out of room.  Yeah, dude.  How about sports and stuff like that?  Like, are the kids ever going to see what real grass is and stuff like that?  Are they scared of grass?  I rented a beach house this summer. 
[00:16:00]  And they were out of their...  Out east.  And they were out of their fucking...  Where out east?  Where?  Well, out east.  Out east.  What are you like?  Hampton.  Super, like, secretive or something?  Well, Hampton's.  Oh, the Hampton's area.  All right, cool.  You know, we could say that.  Out east.  I looked at the Jersey Shore.  Out east could be the Azores.  You know what I'm saying?  I looked at the Jersey Shore.  I didn't, you know...  You guys are still cleaning up down there.  Yeah, yeah.  We had some...  Yeah, it's been rough.  I live in...  My house is in Ortley Beach, right there, man.  Got fucked up?  Well, we got eight inches of water on our first floor, but it's... 
[00:16:30]  You know, all the neighborhood people, like, you know, the older people who've been  in their family for so many years, you know, they're on ground level, and they just  got five feet of water.  I was like...  It was crazy.  Right after the storm, I went down there, and there's all these people from out of state.  And, yeah, we'll come and clean your thing, you know, trying to rip these people off.  I got a couple of my goon buddies, and they said, listen, nobody comes down the street.  We'll go and help.  And we helped the people out on the road, and try to do whatever we could, and going  over and grabbing people's clothes, because you couldn't get on the island, and bringing  them back out, and, you know...  It was a mess, man.  Wait, where is this place? 
[00:17:00]  In Ortley.  I don't know where that is.  It's right where...  You know where the roller coaster was on TV?  Did you see the roller coaster in the water?  A mile from there.  Oh, no kidding.  It was the worst-hit place.  Yeah, there, and Manilocan were probably the two worst.  Right.  And there's, like, probably, you know, a couple hundred houses up on the beach that they just  knocked down.  It looks like Beirut.  But they're doing a great job of cleaning it up.  Until the fire hit.  Dude, I was there last weekend.  I'm down the shore.  The night before, I went out, had a couple cocktails, went to a steak place right on the  boardwalk, about two in the morning, got done, came back home, woke up, did a couple 
[00:17:30]  things.  As I was leaving, around 1.30, 2 o'clock, I saw some smoke.  I go, man, what the hell's going on?  I'm having a little fire or something.  But by the time I got back up, I live in North Jersey, up north.  Not North.  I'm going to tell you the time.  I was being vague.  Yep.  No, yeah.  You know, not the Hamptons, but, you know, it's up in North Jersey.  I'm wondering if you threw a cigar out the window before you left down there.  No.  And the whole boardwalk was on fire.  It was crazy.  It really is horrible.  Punch after punch.  You think it's an arsenal?  No, I think that, you know, the salt water and, you know, yeah, guys get money, you know, 
[00:18:00]  to go rebuild a lot of the electrical stuff and they, you know, listen, you get a hundred  grand, all of a sudden they only, you know, they think it's their money.  Like, listen, go fix your stuff the right way.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Try to cut corners.  That's what happens.  Wow.  You know, it's not good.  But if you need any more information on the shields and guards, go to guardyourmanhood.com.  Got it right.  Exactly.  I didn't tell you what I wanted in my backyard.  Oh, what else?  Yeah, go ahead.  Instead of a man cave, and I swear to you, if I ever get a big house with a big yard,  I want to get a tree house to nap in. 
[00:18:30]  A tree house to nap in a tree house.  I swear to you.  But like the man cave, but it'll be a great bed, maybe a flat screen.  You can do that for me, bro.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Let's do it for the show.  Sure.  Buy a house first, cheapo.  Get out of the Hamptons.  Get out of the Hamptons.  Prick.  Renting in the Hamptons.  And I bought it in New York.  It's crazy.  It's ridiculous.  But yeah, I want to pimp out a tree house.  Dude, you know, come over where I live, man.  Come over where I live.  It's beautiful over there.  I got two acres.  Can we hang out?  Yeah, I'll hang out with you. 
[00:19:00]  All right, we'll hang out a little bit.  Once a month.  Once a month.  Tony's got to go, they're saying.  What the fuck is that about?  Yeah, I got other things.  All right.  Hey, Tony, always a pleasure.  Hey, guys, appreciate it, man.  Thank you, sir.  Let's not be around.  I got some Giants games, stuff like that.  If you ever need me, just give me a call.  And I like what you do on the sidelines.  Thanks, man.  We didn't really talk about it, but you, you know, I don't, I don't like the broads on  the sidelines.  I like a guy that.  I do a completely different thing than other people.  No, I know.  I'm an analyst down there.  I got a whole booth.  I got like almost what you guys got here.  You know your shit.  And I'm not saying broads don't know, but they haven't taken any hits. 
[00:19:30]  I like hearing from the guys that might have taken a few hits out there.  Yeah, a little bit of experience does help a little bit.  You know, credibility.  No, they're good to look at.  We all know that.  It's like if I need any questions about track, I'd ask you.  Well, yeah, sure.  The Worst of the Week countdown continues.  Rolling right along.  It's me, Sam Roberts, from O&A and after O&A Live.  And this is the Worst of the Week countdown still to come.  I mean, this is a big week for radio.  Hugh Jackman was in studio.  Ron Artest was on the phone.  Metta World Peace, you may know him as. 
[00:20:00]  Paul Williams, we called him on his birthday.  We went through a list of teachers who slept with students.  Stalker Patty returned to the show.  But right now, what I want to play for you is we found Anthony was caught in a YouTube  loop, and he found an old public access television show called Stairway to Stardom.  Unfortunately, the stairway was falsely advertised as it actually led to a pit of nothingness.  We never heard from any of the people who participated on this show, Stairway to Stardom, ever again. 
[00:20:30]  However, YouTube has encapsulated them for all of us to see for all of time.  We watch Stairway to Stardom, and we comment here on The Countdown.  I was online last night just watching the greatest fucking thing ever.  My videos and...  Oh, Jimmy, you ruined the surprise. 
[00:21:00]  That's what I was going to say.  Hey, it was Stairway to Stardom.  This was a show that was on cable access back in the late 70s, early 80s.  This fucking creepy guy ran it, and it's so cheesy, and it's all these New Yorkers.  It's like a talent show.  It's America's Got Talent for New York back in the 70s and 80s.  So incredibly bad. 
[00:21:30]  Where is it?  Well, I tweeted a bunch of links.  Any of the links I tweeted late last night, you have to see.  The comedians are my favorite, and the impressionists are the greatest.  Or an impressionist.  Uh, let's see, that guy, oh, we need some volume.  Yeah, and I need to see it, because Sam's like, he's watching TV at home, feed up.  That guy runs the show.  The guy on the right.  Yeah.  He looks like he touches kids.  Oh, this is a dancer. 
[00:22:00]  Don't go to the dancer yet.  I mean, we've got to get some audio more than visual.  So go down to, um, this guy.  Is that it?  No, no, no.  Keep going.  One more, sorry.  Uh, yeah.  Lauren Bacall's fucking 90?  Try.  Jesus.  No.  This will be a link.  Fuck.  Oh, maybe that guy.  Yeah, go to that guy.  See what he's doing.  Let's bring out Wayne Rubin, everybody.  He's a comedian. 
[00:22:30]  Thank you.  You know this guy?  Potted plant behind him.  Thank you.  As you know, every year, Jerry Lewis has a telethon for muscular dystrophy, and of course,  it's a very worthwhile cause.  What would happen if he had a telethon for dandruff?  I think we'd go something like this.  All right, here we are on our 24th hour for dandruff, and so far we have reached a total  of a dollar.  A dollar in 24 hours?  I have here a letter from the President of the United States.  It says, Dear Jerry, good luck in your fight against dandruff. 
[00:23:00]  What's the matter?  Ray, you couldn't send a few dollars with the letter?  And now from the Middle East, I'd like to bring out, here's Menachem Begum.  Menachem, come on out here.  Louie, Louie, where is he, Louie?  He ain't here?  Well, Menachem couldn't be with us, so instead I'd like to bring out the voice of racing,  Fred Caposella.  Thank you, Jerry.  The horses are on the track.  It is now post-time.  Chip loves it.  In this race, fat lady, 10 pounds over. 
[00:23:30]  And it's cabbage by a head.  Thank you, Fred.  And now, from Jackie Gleason's American Scene Magazine, here's Joe the bartender and Crazy  Guggenham.  Oh.  How you doing, Donahee?  Craze Shoy's in the back.  I'll call him out.  Hey, Craze.  Hi, Joe.  Hello, Mr. Donahee.  You like it, Chip?  Okay, guys.  Just look him.  I was hanging around the house.  I wasn't doing nothing.  Oh, this guy. 
[00:24:00]  Now, the voice of the late, great Nat King Cole singing the Christmas song.  My mother loved him.  And now he just sings the rest of the song.  Chess.  Nights roasting on an open fire.  This is staleway to stardom.  People may not realize this is all one guy doing all those things.  Oh, I know.  You might not realize it.  Otherwise, that is El Escalator to Obscurity.  Yes.  All right, enough of him.  Yeah, you're fucking jealous because he sounds like the people. 
[00:24:30]  I know.  I am.  He's a garbage.  Go to, uh...  Yeah, there's another impressionist.  I hope you can find him.  Oh, I think this guy is...  Oh, yeah.  Ha-ha.  It just gets better.  Oh, this guy rolls.  Yeah, maybe him.  Johnny Gallagher.  This guy is the greatest...  He has nothing.  I've seen this before.  You know, ladies and gentlemen,  that Jerry Cooney and Larry's home fight was really...  Larry's home fight.  He's a little nervous.  He's a little nervous.  ...picture if our politicians were in a fight game. 
[00:25:00]  It goes something like this.  And now, Howard Cosell.  Oh, good.  Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  With me, the former president of the United States,  Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy, you don't look beat.  Oh, no.  Well, I'll afford every top contender,  but I promise that I will be back next year,  and I will win with the help of my brother, Billy.  Thank you.  How can we take you now to Las Vegas 
[00:25:30]  when we have Jack Nicholson with Ronnie Reagan back?  Oh, this is going to be good.  How the hell are you, Howie?  It's so good to see you.  Oh, God.  And with me is...  Chip is loving it.  Fucking guy's good.  You never look so good.  Well, I'm just a rough, tough cream puff.  And you know, I'll meet him next time.  I'll meet Jimmy or Henry.  Oh, my God.  Here we go, I'm with Henry Kissinger. 
[00:26:00]  Henry, he's amazing.  He's here at the studio.  I want to tell you the truth.  They used to beat me up all the time.  Dick Nixon, all of them.  I want to fight everybody.  Okay, let's go with Rocky Balbolla.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And with Nixon, Rocky.  What's the matter with you, huh?  You don't like my friend?  You think he can't fight?  How embarrassing is this?  This is so bad.  Come on, Richie, yeah?  I could watch this guy for an hour. 
[00:26:30]  Yes, last night I was just going through all these clips.  He's doing his Richard Nixon.  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.  Look at the drummer in the background.  He's like Norman Fell.  I'm really doing this.  No laughs from the drum.  He's just waiting for his turn to drop.  Cary Grant fighting.  This is the worst backdrop ever.  Come on, yes, yes, yes.  Put up your hands.  Come on, fight me, fight me.  Come on, yes, yes.  Not for the fight thing.  Alfred Hitchcock.  Oh, good. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, Jesus.  He's bombing terribly.  Why don't you farts me at 3 o'clock?  Why, thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  You've been a gracious audience.  Thank you.  Now he's so good.  It's like Carson.  When Carson pulled over a comic, he talks to the host.  Carson's the same one.  Can you do something that nobody else does?  Sure.  Kill yourself.  You can?  Three voices that nobody has ever done on TV.  Okay.  Here's mine.  Okay. 
[00:27:30]  Roger Moore.  I say there, Daniel.  How are you?  Nice to see you.  Hello.  This is James Bond.  Al Pacino.  You can't even sound British.  Pacino.  No one does Al Pacino.  I don't want to see you get hurt.  You know what I mean?  So if you want to listen to me, do what you want.  And Squiggy of Laverne and Shirley.  Hello.  This is Squigman and his friend, Lenny.  And we come to Chicago to see Laverne.  What is that?  That gets the applause break. 
[00:28:00]  You know, you make me look short.  You know that, don't you?  This guy's got charisma to host up.  Holy shit.  Whatever happened to that guy?  His name's Johnny Gallagher.  I would love to know what happened to all these people.  I must have watched 20 or 25 clips from this show.  What?  Just the whole thing.  That's a hard one to Google.  Johnny Gallagher's kind of a common name.  Try it.  Let's Google him.  Oh, there's the opener.  Play the opener of the show.  Oh my God.  His pros are horrendous.  Listen to their New York accent. 
[00:28:30]  Stay tuned because Stairway to Stardom is next with Frank Massey.  Here's the big opener.  It's some glittery fucking...  Stay away to Stardom.  They got a song.  You know...  You'll see tomorrow...  You can put this show as is on a dump swim on Cartoon Network.  Yes!  And it would work.  Yes.  We're here to brighten up your day.  Brighten up your day. 
[00:29:00]  We've got singers and dancers and actors for bonding for you.  Ventriloquism.  Let's have this song.  There we go.  It's like the beards and it's a highlight reel.  It's on a street show.  The low boots.  Stay away to Stardom.  The camera angles and the fades to try to make it look like a real variety show.  Did any of these people make it?  I haven't seen one person.  In the open, we've seen a lot of people we've never heard of before. 
[00:29:30]  And the stage is so...  That backdrop...  I'm going to do comedy in front of somebody that said Tawid and Jihad behind it.  They pop his face up on it.  Yeah, it's...  Stay away to Stardom.  A lot of clips online.  Yeah, that guy's rocking.  Here, let's see one more.  You got one more we should say?  Let's go back down.  Find one I tweeted that was a little lower than...  One more. 
[00:30:00]  Lower?  Than that one.  Just...  Better friend said she was hilarious?  Oh, yeah!  This is another comic.  A comedian.  Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.  Guess what?  Anyway, I just came to New York recently.  You know her?  Paul, what's her name?  Excuse me.  Is that Fran Capo?  No, Cheryl Klein.  Cheryl Klein.  Don't know.  You don't know Cheryl Klein?  You should know her, man.  She's funny.  She might be Jewish.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I'll bet you she is a JKB.  My mother always said,  Chipper, watch out for them. 
[00:30:30]  They're going to take your money.  What?  My mother said,  if you want to see how many Jewish people  there are,  roll a penny out,  Chipper,  they'll run for it  and clunk their heads.  You should be on this show.  I'm not originally from New York.  I came here like a lot of you  people looking out there.  A lot of you cesareans.  Make it big in show business.  Nothing.  I gave myself three weeks.  I have two hours left.  Two?  No.  An hour and four minutes.  Anyway, no,  I'm going to make it fine.  If I don't make it here, honey,  I'll go back to visit my mother in Miami  because I got a letter from my father,  a telegram yesterday.  Come to Miami. 
[00:31:00]  I said,  Daddy,  I'm not coming to Miami.  She drives me nuts.  He said,  Cheryl,  your mother went to a change of life.  She's going to start living hers  instead of mine.  Listen up, guys!  I'm moving, listen.  Now, listen.  My mother,  maybe you know her.  She's the queen of denial,  the love goddess of King's Highway.  God bless this lady.  But she identifies  with major characters of the Bible.  Like last Thursday,  she had a Moses complex.  You know how Moses  led the Israelites out of Egypt?  My mother had a similar experience.  She led our family circle  out of an A&S white sale.  A&S. 
[00:31:30]  I said,  Ma,  I have no room for the she.  She said,  where am I?  I said,  I look like the cold clock's flying.  She said,  where the she?  Just don't know.  I'll break your head.  Daddy,  leave me alone.  Tell her to leave me alone.  Cheryl,  don't call your mother she.  This is the story of my life.  I go to Miami.  She's happy.  She's living in a condominium.  Maybe you've heard of it.  Yenta Towers.  She makes a face.  Oh.  I'm going to tell my friends  where I'm going.  Thank you for a laugh.  She's sitting on a golden room.  She's having a little schnapps.  I said,  Ma,  what are you schnappsing me?  She said,  sit down and join in the activity. 
[00:32:00]  I said,  what's the activity?  Sitting down and watching  Gidget Coast Kosher  on a purple velveteen couch,  you know?  Good microphone, too.  Unbelievable.  She has a pool  in the shape of her mouth.  The lifeguard can't swim.  They're paying to listen.  My daughter,  she moved out of the house.  She calls?  She calls twice a day.  Big deal.  That's where the...  Unbelievable.  My mother used to sing me a lullaby.  It went something like this.  Go to sleep,  my flesh and blood.  Go to sleep,  my chubby child.  I'll stay up for a while 
[00:32:30]  to work my fingers to the bone  to give you and your son of a...  your fat and great brother Larry  a nice home.  Oh, she's great.  Oh, she's great.  Oh, she's great.  How fucking horrid.  That's all I want to do  is watch this.  Oh, wow.  I love it.  Find one more underneath  that one on my...  She said son instead of brother.  She fucked everything up.  Oh, she's nervous  on the big show.  Oh, God.  I wonder where this was shot. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, somewhere in the city.  Early 80s.  I'm sure.  Oh, this guy.  It's a singing act.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I hate the way  this guy says cabaret.  He's singing cabaret.  Fine, singer.  Let's bring him out.  Jimmy Swatzman, right?  There he is.  Jimmy Swatzman.  At least the hostess style.  Look at this guy.  It's like Seinfeld.  Wait, this is...  This is real?  Oh, yeah.  This is serious.  What could he be sitting along with you? 
[00:33:30]  Look at him.  He's all dramatic.  Come hear the music play.  Come to the cabaret.  Cabaret.  Cabaret.  Come to the cabaret.  Look at the cuts.  That guy's fingers on the piano.  Yeah.  Come hear the music play.  Come to the cabaret.  Cabaret.  Cabaret. 
[00:34:00]  I was fixated on this.  Oh, what a toothy ass.  Cabaret.  Come give a band.  Come blow your horn.  Start celebrating right this way.  Your table's waiting.  Uh-oh.  Bring it down.  Where's the camera going?  This is all right.  Double shot of his rotation cheeks.  I can't just fly away.  That is so bad. 
[00:34:30]  Come to the cabaret.  Oh, so he has the Dumb and Dumber chip tooth.  Like at the cabaret, old chum.  To the Dumb and Dumber.  So come to the cabaret.  I could not stop watching these last night.  What about the magic act?  Oh, there is a magician.  Yeah.  Yes, a magician. 
[00:35:00]  He's a little awkward.  I don't think that's him from the show, though.  There's another one of Jimmy Schwartzman.  That's him again?  Wait, he got two songs on.  Why wouldn't he?  All right.  Put him on.  Two appearances, because he's dressed differently.  Jimmy Schwartzman, everybody.  Schwartzman.  Jimmy Schwartzman.  This is delightful colors.  Wow.  Wow.  Nice shirt.  It's a little more like a star this time.  Blind guy in the back of the floor.  There is a brotherhood of man, manly brotherhood of man, a noble tithe of mine. 
[00:35:30]  All human hearts and minds into one brotherhood.  Uh-oh, they're going for the split screen.  They're going for the split.  And there it is.  You can tell the camera goes the way over to one side.  Your lifelong membership is free. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  He keeps turning to the side.  I think Bartlett sang this song in How to Succeed.  Did he?  This is from How to Succeed, isn't it?  Oh.  He did much, much better than me when I saw.  Also, the setting was much more appropriate.  Yeah.  I think Bartlett sang this song in How to Succeed.  Manly brotherhood of man.  Manly brotherhood of man.  Guy's great teeth.  Does he have a sore on his lips?  He's got a sore on his lips.  It looks like he does.  He appears to him. 
[00:36:30]  He probably was nervous in the dressing room in an outbreak.  There's hundreds of people watching.  There's a big coat sore on his lips.  Holy shit.  He has his bright shirt with the biggest collar up in his tracks.  Oh my God.  Oh, who's got to use that mic next?  He's got a giant coat.  And the band behind him couldn't look more like dead people.  The trumpet player is, like, relaxing against the wall. 
[00:37:00]  He's just chilling out.  A smattering of applause.  This is no PFG TV.  No, no, it's not.  What's his name?  Let's go to Google him.  By the way, we've got to get Scorch on the show, man.  He lost his game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We've got to talk to the Scorch.  Let's Google that singer.  I want to know where he is.  Where Jimmy Schwartz...  Jimmy Schwartzman.  Schwartzman.  It's in 1982, that one was.  Schwartzman.  Wow.  That's 30 years ago.  About 31 years ago. 
[00:37:30]  He's probably running fucking the Schwartzman law firm.  Yeah.  Schwartzman fucking...  Yeah.  What?  This is from 2006.  No way.  He's still doing it.  No way.  What's that?  Jimmy...  Come on.  Jimmy Schwartzman is here?  Woo!  That's him.  That's him.  Where did they fucking find him? 
[00:38:00]  Can't help.  It's amazing.  I gotta get him on the show.  That's him, all right.  He's getting up to the scene.  Oh, my God.  They fucking...  2006. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  I hope he says that the same way.  It's him.  I'm so glad he didn't die in 9-11.  Yeah.  That would have been terrible.  He's not that bad.  2006, he's back.  He's not as bad.  He doesn't seem to be full of that youthful exuberance anymore.  He's been beaten down by life. 
[00:39:00]  He thought he was going to be a fucking singer.  A Broadway star.  Beaten down.  Yeah, well...  Go listen to our old tapes.  He's the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Wow.  Cabaret.  Is there any more?  Come to the cab.  Is that him in the middle?  That's him.  That's him.  I guess they did some kind of reunion thing.  Oh, man.  What?  Stairway to Stardom reunion?  Yeah.  Stairway to Stardom reunion.  Wow. 
[00:39:30]  That's fucking great.  Go back to the original Stairway to Stardom.  Yeah, where's...  Maybe we can find one you haven't watched yet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One more.  I know there's some more singing and dancing.  Let's see.  What's down below?  That's wonderful.  What do we got?  What's our choices here?  Oh, another comedian.  Oh!  Yeah, let's go comedian.  That's the guy down there in the middle.  Yeah, that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don Costello.  Don Costello.  Don Costello, I know.  You know Don Costello? 
[00:40:00]  I do know Don Costello.  Where's he?  This is an interview.  Interview?  Yeah.  Well, maybe it's not a real interview.  I'm sure he does a few jokes.  I think we should issue Don Costello.  I really do.  You mean on the level?  On the level.  We haven't done it, and people want to know about him.  Okay, Don.  Full screen, please.  Come on, Don.  Why don't you get here right in between us here?  You don't mind stepping out of character, do you?  No.  Just a little.  You know, we've known Don for several years now,  and just recently we found out that he's been making movies and everything else. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Tell us.  You're really modest.  Tell us a little about yourself, Don.  Well, I was in Guys and Dolls.  I played Harry the Horse, the gangster, and the poor soul, and the barry mission.  Then I was in Stuck on You, the first turn-on.  He looks familiar.  The adventure, which is playing now.  Yes.  And I played in the intoxicated butler in the first turn-on, which I just mentioned.  And I had a lot of fun doing it, because I love to make people laugh. 
[00:41:00]  And if I see a smile on their face, it makes me happy.  Fuck, yeah.  I hope to do that for many years.  What's with the backdrop?  If there's more people like you, Don, in this world, it'd be a better place to live in.  Don Castillo.  Wow, that was a good interview.  He looked deeply depressed.  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder what ever happened to him.  Oh, here's a little...  You like this?  A little duet?  A little duo.  Robert F. Amico and Sue Veneer.  God, not one name we know.  Nothing. 
[00:41:30]  They never went on to anything.  Sue went on to a successful teeth-fixing business.  Did she?  Yes.  Sue Veneer.  Sue Veneer.  Sue Veneer, yes.  Either that or people would take her home to remember things by.  Yeah, that's exactly.  Get it?  A souvenir.  All right.  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen...  Can you play this?  I've heard this song.  Robert...  This is called I'm a Cunt.  Oh!  Oh, yes.  I'm a Cunt.  Take a look.  Oh.  And Sue Veneer. 
[00:42:00]  Zappa.  Fucking me in the 80s.  All right.  Terrific.  That looks like Frank Zappa.  Is that Zappa?  Yeah, it looks like Zappa.  It's like you up to the mountains.  We made love till dawn.  Two bodies pressed together, yeah.  In total warm.  Friends before, lovers after. 
[00:42:30]  They're trying to...  So the story goes.  I love you, babe.  What happened?  Who knows?  This is so bad.  I know.  I wonder how many people thought they said Junos and got offended.  Now we're not together.  I miss those summer nights.  Massage your tensions away.  You said it felt right.  Was this supposed to be like a meatloaf song? 
[00:43:00]  Like a paradise by the dashboard light?  In bed by one.  Come on, admit it, babe.  It was fun, yeah.  Oh, God.  This is so incredibly bad.  The writing's amazing.  Yeah, it really is.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's rocking now. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Wonder where you are now.  Don't see you no more.  The last time I spoke to you.  We were at war.  Hey.  With our friends.  With our love.  This is true.  Vision of the past.  The summer of 83 went fast.  The summer of 83 went fast? 
[00:44:00]  That's it?  That's it.  Wow.  That was stink on row.  My special guest, precious Pat.  Oh, no.  She does a dramatic thing.  Loving you is easy because you're beautiful.  Little Mae Riperton.  Yeah.  Making love with you is all I want to do.

[00:46:30]  It's known for those notes  So you have to do them  Everybody's waiting for that one part  That's why no one does that song  Yeah, that's the only reason you would listen to that dumb song  Oh my god, that's hilarious  Precious Taft has been on other ones  Though I saw her doing a dramatic reading  She's literally crying her eyes out  Really?  Her face in snot running down her nose  She got fucking  Yeah, yeah  Does anyone remember this show?

[00:54:00]  I thought you got kicked out of the house at 14  Yeah who told you  I'm just reading about you now  Where did this info come from  I figured I should get to know you as you're sitting here  You read this beforehand  I didn't  What's the story there  Why did you get kicked out at 14  Oh man that was a good story  Actually I got into a  Oh this is bad  I got into a big fight  With my mother's husband  At the time 
[00:54:30]  In the street  And I had to leave  That was it  And she picked the husband over the son  Well you know  The new husband  Yeah  No he wasn't new  He's been around  But you know  I just had to go  Well whose fault was the fight  You had to go  I don't know whose fault it was  I guess it was my fault I lost  You know  I lost the fight  You know it's weird  Like when you're a kid  When you're 14  And you know  Something like that happens  You get  You're more upset  You're not thinking of it  Like  Like 
[00:55:00]  Like  I'm 14  And he's a grown man  You think of it like  I lost a fight  You know  And it's almost embarrassing  You know what I mean  But then when you get older  You're like  Man I had no business  Even being in that situation  You know  Well how did you  Did you start the physical thing  Or was he physical with you  No  What happened was  I  I was going to school  Me and my mother  Falling on to this big  Blow up thing  Or whatever  Because  My mother got religious again  And I didn't want to go to church  I was  I was really rebellious  I thought I was rebellious  I was really just  A little shit 
[00:55:30]  And  She got pissed off at me  One day  And I was going home  And I was so upset  And I took my books  And I just threw them in the street  And she saw me from down the block  Because she was going to work  Her and  Her husband were going to work  And she like  Came up  They were on a bus  Because they were going to New York  And she got off the bus  And she chased me down  And just flipped out on me  Right  Like she was like  Swinging a purse at me  And my mother is a woman  But you know  She's not  I'm not going to hit my mother 
[00:56:00]  So I'm just making sure  She's not hitting me though  And I'm kind of grabbing the purse  Like away from her  So that she wouldn't hit me  And she was getting frustrated  Because her arms were getting tired  That purse was heavy  She carries everything  And then he kind of like  Stepped in  And he popped me one good time  Wow  Oh man  Yeah  Because I guess he saw  She couldn't get me  Like she wanted to  So she was like  Well let me take care of it  And then I got into it  With him  And that's how that went  It didn't last very long  It was a lot like  One of Tyson's fights  I guess 
[00:56:30]  I'll bring it back  I can bring it right back  Well did you  But why did you leave  I mean I left shortly  Like around the same time  Except I was 30  What made you get out of the house  At 14  You're like  I can't live with this guy  No  Well I mean I just couldn't  Stay there  I was just like  I'm not  I didn't go back  I just couldn't go back there  Do you still see them?  Yeah I see them  We're good now  Oh okay  Yeah yeah  That was like  It seemed wrong at the time  But it was probably  For the best for me  Like I probably needed that  I needed kind of  To realize I wasn't an adult 
[00:57:00]  You know  What was the first time  Going back  Like after you leave that  Because for me  When I would leave the house  It would be like  A fucking argument  You know  And then I'd be  Knocking on the fucking door  Like maybe once in a while  They'd make me spend the night  At a friend's house  If I was really being a little twat  Yeah  But I was one of seven  So my mother had kicked  I think everybody  All my brothers and sisters  Have been kicked out  At least once before 16  Each one of them  At least once  So like that's just  That's just a poor family  Like we just  You get kicked out  That's how they deal with things  They kick you out 
[00:57:30]  It's like playing for a bad franchise  You just  You never know  You're not up to snuff  You might get cut  You get cut from the house  Yeah you get released  And that's it  You're a free agent  You get traded to a poorer family  And that's how it happens  Where's my guy  You get traded to his grandmother  Oh okay  That's exactly how it happens  So  You know  It wasn't really nothing  I knew the way the game played  So I just left  I went to my sister's house  For a while  And then I went to my father's house  Who lived in New York  And that's when I moved back to New York  Because this was in Jersey City 
[00:58:00]  You're not doing stand up that long too  Mike's a really funny stand up  Like a really really good comic  Thanks man  And you're like  You're like five years and under right  Four  This would be four years October  Damn  I'm always happy when I hear that  And it makes me sick  Like when I see a really good actor  Who's only doing it a few years  You're like oh fuck  He's gonna be around for a long time  Yeah  I've always wanted to do it  I just had like crippling stage fright  Which just would  I just refused to get on stage  I was so scared to get on stage  And I remember I was saving up  For a stand up comedy class  For like two or three years 
[00:58:30]  I just could never get $400 together  And then I just ended up  Buying a bottle of E&J  And paying $5 for an open mic  And then I tried  And I was like wow  I could do this  You know  It wasn't good  I just knew  This was something I could figure out  At least you're not scared  To get up there  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Like I was like  Well if that's the worst  That could happen  Then I'm fine  Who was your first ball munching?  Oh Newark  I'll never forget it  I was at the Key Club in Newark  I was with this comic  Richie Redd  And I was opening for him  It was five minutes  Up front first 
[00:59:00]  And I remember  I've never bombed before  I mean like I've had sets where  But I just never bombed  Like really bombed  Damn I'm good  Yeah I was like  I don't think it could happen  Oh all these bomb stories  The other cops tell  They suck  Like it couldn't happen  Oh man  And actually I think  I told Richie before  Like I've never bombed before  And he was just like  Oh jinxed  Stick around  I literally told him that  And then I got on stage  And I remember  As soon as I grabbed the microphone  It was an all black club  And I just couldn't even hear myself 
[00:59:30]  Thinking over them  Not giving a fuck about me  Like they were just all  In their own conversations  And finally I look over to my right  And there's this black girl  Standing  With a table full of girls  And she's standing on a table  Yelling at me  Where are your jokes  What the fuck are you talking  Where are your jokes  Oh my god  And I'm like what  How did she get on the table  That fast  It's a five minute set  I'm like two minutes in  I'm like when did she figure out  I should climb the table  And get them off  And I was like  What the fuck is going on  And the guy that's in the back  He's like get off 
[01:00:00]  Get off  And I left  And then this dude gets on  And he destroys  With a magnum condom bit  And that was  That was the end of that set  Oh man  Is that the  It was the worst feeling in the world  When you bomb  And the next guy  You just assume  That it's a bad room  But then that guy kills  The next guy does well  You just  You just fucking bombed  And he wasn't even a comic  He was just a guy  That like produces the show  He was like kind of  Emceeing it  Oh shit  And he gets on  And he just did like  The hackiest  Yeah of course  You know  My dick is this  That and third  Or whatever 
[01:00:30]  And people were just  Eating up  I think it was just buzzwords  They were just drunk  And one day  Just yelling  Yeah  Dick  Pussy  Fuck  And he was just yelling shit  Oh man  And I wasn't  You know  I'm used to  Open mic supportive rooms  Yeah  Where the worst case scenario  Is silence  As opposed to  People really telling you  Get the fuck off  Jumping on the table  On the table  Yeah it was the worst  She was standing on the table  And her friends were hysterical  Laughing at me  Oh man  Where is she now though  I don't know  I think she's on the Apollo  I think she's  Probably 
[01:01:00]  But there's no answer  To where are your jokes  There's no  Oh man  Because you can't go  But I've been doing them  Yes I did them  And it's not a real question  We're just listening  No  If you weren't talking  You'd hear my jokes  There's no logic  Yeah  Where are your jokes  In your filthy cunt  Where are your jokes  I'll never forget that  But it was like  That was the day  I thought  I was like  Oh wow  I'm going to do comedy  Probably forever  Because at first  It was the worst feeling  In the world  Then I got on the phone  And I called  One of my friends  And told him about it 
[01:01:30]  And we're laughing  Just cracking up  And I was like  Oh shit  I think I'm in love  It's like being in love  With a psychopath  This might be the big one  Yeah they do something  And at first  You're like  I can't live with it  And then you're like  You know what  The fact that she fucking  Spit my own cum in my hair  I like her  There's something about this girl  Yeah there's something about her  I don't know  I want to spend my life with her  Yeah and that was it  That's funny  And I also said too  That you  Did you know Patrice or no?  I actually met Patrice 
[01:02:00]  Like two  Like two times  And because he  I used to live in Jersey City  So I used to see him around  I remember one  The first time I met him  Was in a  A post office  And I wanted to say something to him  But I was kind of  Like I was intimidated  And it was like me  This Asian dude  And then him  And I'm like  That's why I wanted to say something  I don't want to bother him  And then he looked back  At the Asian dude  He looked at me  And he turns around  And he looks back  At the Asian dude  And looks at me again  And he goes  Don't this motherfucker  Look like Manny Pacquiao  And then we bust out laughing together  And the guy  The Asian dude  Just standing there 
[01:02:30]  Like that was racist  But he didn't give a fuck  And I was like  Well I gotta talk to him now  And I talked to him  I told him I was doing comedy  And he was like  Really really supportive  He gave me his number  Oh really?  But I never bothered him  Or anything  But then I seen him again  In the street  And he was like  Yeah you still doing this  You know  Sticking and hanging there  Or whatever  And that was the only two times  I ever met him  And I remember one time  I got a text  I got a text  And it was like  A few weeks after  Because I was buzzed  Because Patrice is like  One of my favorite comedians  Of all time  And I got a text  And it was like  Hey man 
[01:03:00]  This is Patrice  How you doing?  I'm like  Oh shit  What's up?  And he was like  No I'm just kidding  It was one of my friends  Fucking with me  I didn't know his number  And it was like  The worst  Fucking ass  I had to pretend  It was funny  For a long time  I was like  Oh yeah  Good one  Good one Mike  But it wasn't  Dick  It was like  Oh you asshole  I really thought  Patrice loved me  Yeah cause I never got  A text from Patrice  Going how you doing  Yeah he's like  Hey how you doing  Everything good with comedy  And I'm like  What?  Are you serious?  But no it wasn't him at all  Oh good for Mike  You described him perfectly though 
[01:03:30]  No filter  He didn't give a fuck  He didn't care  That post office stories  It was just funny  That's Patrice  Absolutely  Did he know you guys  Were together or no?  Nah we wasn't together  Oh he was a stranger  He was a stranger in between  It was just some dude  Just some Asian dude  Just standing there  Waiting to cash a check  Or something  I don't know  Mailed his rent  And he's like  Don't this motherfucker  Look like man  He could care less  About how he's feeling  That's him right  I was like  I gotta talk to him now  Cause it says in the prep sheet  That you  You see an elephant in the room 
[01:04:00]  Made you want to  Throw everything away  And start over  Oh I think it made  A lot of people want to  Because it was just so  It seemed like  It was a lot more  He had a lot more  Compassion in that one  Which made it even funnier  Because it was almost like  You were rooting for him  To be horrible  You know  You were rooting for the logic  It seemed like the audience  Was way more on the side  As opposed to  Isolating some people  It seemed like  It was like  Yeah this guy  You know  I don't know  I just thought  One of the best specials  I've seen  Yeah 
[01:04:30]  Yeah  Fucking amazing man  Yeah  It was crazy  It was nuts  I really wish I could have  You know  Been more  Been ridiculously insulted  By him at some point  I feel like  I would have  Loved nothing more  Right  You know  Yeah  It was a great feeling  When he fucking  Found something  And just like  Nailed you with it  And you're like  Oh fucking brilliant  The best thing about it though  Was like  I remember after he passed  It was like  A lot of people  Who you could tell  Probably didn't like him  As much when he was around 
[01:05:00]  Yeah yeah  But you missed him so much  When he was gone  Because I remember  There was this girl  That told me  She's like  Oh man I love Patrice  It's so sad that he's gone  I never forget  One time  The first time I met him  I said  Hey Patrice  I'm a big fan  I'm a comedian too  And he says  No you're not  Because I'm a comedian  And there's no way  We could be the same thing  And I was like  That's the memory  You have  That's the golden memory  That she shared  And I was like  Special  Special moment  That's the best 
[01:05:30]  Wow  There's always a horror story  About him too  Like for every  For every one good story  There's fucking ten  Oh he was awful  To these stories  Well a lot of comics  Didn't like him  Because he was fucking  Just brutal  He didn't like  Shitty comics  He just  He couldn't pretend  To be  But he was very honest  I mean when I broke up  With my girlfriend  One point years ago  He goes  So  If I see her now again  I don't have to say hi  I don't gotta be nice to her  Or none of that shit  Like oh my god  He was just bullshitting 
[01:06:00]  The whole fucking  I don't gotta be nice to her  He would do that  And he couldn't wait  To tell you that  No  Oh my god  We're talking to Michael  By the way  Yes  Really funny  What are you promoting  Mike by the way  I'm not promoting anything  I'm promoting  Just  Just  Hey  Oh you're just hanging out  Yeah I'm just hanging out  I don't have anything to promote  I say  Do I need something  Don't you have any  Oh hell no  Oh no  Get your Santa face  This water's fantastic  This water's great

[01:51:00]  Still to come, Metta World Peace calling in  Hugh Jackman in studio  Yes, the great Dan Tawn himself  But before any of that  We kind of reached an interesting paradox, I guess you would call it  At the O&A show this week  We realized that in the eyes of the law  When a teacher has sexual contact with a student  It's always a bad thing, yes  And in life, morally, it's always a bad thing  Unless the teacher's a beautiful woman 
[01:51:30]  We went through a list of 40 teachers who have slept with their students  All hot women, for the most part  And figured out whether or not what they did morally  Was really right or wrong  I'm not going to make you sit through all 40  We pick up the list around number, I don't know, 22, 23  But you tell me  You agree with the show?  Are you sure that every one of these women  Deserves to be called a crime?  These are teachers that had sex with their students 
[01:52:00]  My favorite  And what kind of sex they had  How old the students were  And some instances they tell what happened to the ladies  And they're all fucking hot  And we're trying to figure out if any of these situations were wrong  And so far, we haven't found one  Yeah, they've gone one through 21  And so far, all of them are just fine  Because I remember being 13 or 14  This would have been an amazing fantasy  Yeah  There was one where they had  Coke was involved, but  Yeah 
[01:52:30]  That one Ant was saying  That one was almost on the fence  No, she was fine  Almost on the fence  Almost on the fence, yes  Well, Ant argued that it would have made the kid's sexual performance better  Yeah, exactly  Keep that rod for a long time  And then we stopped the list  Because we finally found an ugly one  Because look at the blonde  She's obviously not ugly  And then the next one  This is where we stopped  Yeah  She was the first frump in the  She's a bit of a sourpuss  In the bunch  And she's got a hyphenated name  That always spells trouble with a woman 
[01:53:00]  Yes, yes  What did she do, Sam?  This is Jill Lewis  Who's 26  And what did she do?  She told the student she was Justin Long  And then sucked his cock  That's what she looks like  Yeah  I thought it was kind of a Mia Wallace, Adolf Hitler look  No?  Boy, wow  I don't know who Mia Wallace  Oh, Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction  Yeah, but, you know, the Hitler swoop  She's a journalism, speech, and computer teacher  Okay  Who was arrested for having sex with a 17-year-old student  On a deserted road 
[01:53:30]  Ah, it's not that  That's fine  Wow  Oh, Iraq Road  Yeah  Oh, deserted  Anonymous  Probably jealous source  Reported it to the police  That's fine  That's the thing  When you're fucking a teacher  You can't talk  No  Keep your mouth shut  Keep your mouth shut  I might fucking get my cock fucking hard  You're right  The next one  No, this one's the one with the hyphenated name  Yeah, she was arrested for covering premature baldness  With a comb over  She really does have kind of a  Giant fucking skull 
[01:54:00]  What'd she do wrong?  That's Christy Sanchez Trujillo  She's 33 years old  And her in a 7th grade  Oh, oh, oh, sorry  She's a 7th grade social studies teacher  In Albuquerque  And she fell for a 13-year-old student  Oh, boy  She had sex with  Good  She had sex with the 13-year-old boy  Oh, boy  Did she describe as being more experienced than any man she's had sex with? 
[01:54:30]  Wow  How humiliating for the husband  This is totally fine  He was probably a big, like, Mexican kid or something  Yeah  Very experienced  He was mature for his age  Yeah, yeah, yeah  She said he was a 25-year-old in a 13-year-old's body  Yeah  You take your word for it?

[02:22:30]  It's pretty easy  I'm kind of bummed, isn't it?  Yeah, it's pretty simple  Yeah  Yeah, you probably could have done that later today  Looking forward to getting you in the studio  Yeah, what happened?  No, I'm coming through, man  I'm definitely  I hope today was kind of bummed  I'm about to get  Definitely I'm going to come to the studio  We're big Knicks fans, too, man  We might have to fucking start going to Brooklyn, I think, now  Uh-oh  Yeah, no, I'm going to Brooklyn, you know that  Now, are they going to move studios? 
[02:23:00]  We've heard mixed reviews comment  You said what?  Are they going to move the basketball court?  Are they going to move, like, whatever, you know?  In 10 years?  Yeah  I mean, I'm not too familiar with their lease agreement, you know, with the city  But, well, I don't even know if they bought the building  But, you know, I heard that they were renovated  And I stayed there at stage 2 right now  And, you know, when I got back to the garden last year  I was like, wow, that's a whole new garden 
[02:23:30]  Right  You know, it was pretty, um  Just being from New York  Going to the garden  I remember, like, you know, little mice and little things running around  Oh, man  You would see mice running around?  Yeah, they used to have mice  Now they got deer  It's changed  Now they got little flowers  Little plants and gardens  Yeah, yeah  See  You should have been in studio, man 
[02:24:00]  We would have had a good time with you  What's going on with the book?  You got a bed  Like a kid's book called Metta's Bedtime Stories, huh?  Yeah  Kind of ironic  That, you know, Metta Will Keith  A.K.A. Ronickness  Have a kid's book  Everybody thinks it's very ironic  But I thought it was kind of cool  And I tried to make it as close to my personality as possible  Sure  You know  But keeping in mind that, you know, there's books for kids  Yeah  Yeah, but it's good  It's a way to try to get, you know, fathers back 
[02:24:30]  You know, kind of, you know  Giving that little extra five, ten minutes  You know, to read to their children  So we made the book, like, short stories  Where  You gotta find the fathers first  You gotta find the fathers  I thought that was, um  We did that  You gotta find them first  And then, you know  You gotta get them reading  I went to a club one night  Doing that club  Sound like five fathers  Wait, one of the stories is called  What's going on?  There's five stories in the book 
[02:25:00]  One of them is called  Mudded My Bed  Now, is that a lesson about  What I think it's a lesson about?  It's kind of  We made it Mudded My Bed  True story because, you know  Once people read that title  They were going to think it was  Like, doodle in the bed  Yeah  But it was a story that the child  You know, actually forgot  That he went to sleep  With chocolate  And then he got scared  And he thought it was mud in the bed  But it was actually a piece of chocolate 
[02:25:30]  Oh, oh  I like that story  It's kind of funny  It's kind of funny  Are any of these based on, like  Your childhood?  It's kind of funny  It's kind of funny  You said that like  You didn't even write the story  Spoiler  I like that one  It's kind of funny  I like that story  Yeah  It's kind of  It's kind of based on  Things I've been through  Yeah  I've had to base some of it  But then we wanted to be able to write  Certain things  And make it kind of relatable  Yeah  You know, to the kids  And, um  But we got some more  We got this book  And we wrote a couple other books 
[02:26:00]  Yes  This is the first book  I wanted to come out with  Because, um  You know, we wanted to be inspirational  And I had a book on myself  I got a book on my brother  Who was, um  You know, he was, uh  And, um  Kind of  It's called a juvenile delinquency  And he was like 10 years old  30 years old now  And he was in and out of jail  So  Never, um  Went to a  Middle school  Or high school  Or anything like that  So he just came out  Of the halfway house 
[02:26:30]  So I wrote a book on my book  For myself  I got children's books  But I wanted to start  With a children's book  To introduce  My whole book  Right  You know  So we got some cool  Interesting stories  And it was kind of  A good way for me  To get things off my chest  You know  It was kind of  A fair feeling for me  To write these books  Do you  I guess  I guess you like  Kit  You're very involved  In mental health  Too  Why so involved  In mental health  Man  I'm  It's crazy  Because like  You know  I have a lot of  Well of course

We're all good  The headphones  If you need  If need be  I can hear you  Yeah  We're not going to waste  Time taking phone callers  When we have Hugh Jackman  Yeah of course not  That's for sure  Screw the listeners  We want to talk to you  My god  Alright  This new movie you're in  Prisoners  Twisted  Very dark  It is very dark  It's pretty intense  Yeah yeah  Tell us about it  Please  The basic story 
[02:35:30]  Is two families  Get together on Thanksgiving Day  It couldn't be more normal  Or average  And about  Eight minutes into the movie  You know  The girls  Like oh  We're going to go out  And play daddy  And before you know it  We don't know where they are  And so the rest of the movie  Is trying to find them  And it's  It's as intense  As it should be  And let me tell you  Reading  Doing the research  Looking into it  Is about the hardest thing  I've ever done in my life  Really  Even reading it was hard  But you know  It's just so  Heartbreaking  To read what happens to people 
[02:36:00]  What happens to families  You researched it that deeply  Where  Yeah  Well you know  I always  I like to research it  Anyway  To give you things to do  Sure  As an actor  But I came away with this  Not with  I want to do this  I want to do that  I literally came away going  This is going on right now  And I really owe it  To the people going through it  Not that they're going to see it  But to actually do it  As truthfully as we can  And respectfully  And there's a version  Of this movie  That could just be  Just sort of  Exploitative  Or glorify the violence of it  Or just become like 
[02:36:30]  A revenge thriller  Right  I think it needed to be  More than that  Did you speak to anybody  Who'd been through it  No  I didn't  Because  I read  I did hours  There's a lot of videos  There's a lot of books  But I  I just felt weird  Yeah  Making someone go through it  As  Right  Hey I'm Hugh Jackman  I'm an actor  Can you talk to me  And there's enough there  To go through  Yeah yeah  Plus as a parent  It doesn't take much  To understand  Yeah I was going to ask you that  As a parent  Was it kind of disturbing  Just imagining that 
[02:37:00]  I can't  Yeah my character  Has this line in the movie  Pray for the best  Prepare for the worst  Right  And I'm more of a  Just pray for the best  Kind of guy  I forget the other bit  Yeah  This is an actor  I'm spoiled  Someone does it for me  They tell me what to wear  Yeah yeah  I didn't decide any of this  Well it looks great  Hugh I must say  Yeah thank you  You look fantastic  Yeah  And boy do you smell good  I had to say  You smell terrific  I did that bit  I did that bit  But I think it's  What were we talking about  I know right  The parent angle 
[02:37:30]  And the  You know  What the hell  How people do things for you  Well yeah  No that's right  Pray for the best  Prepare for the worst  But after this movie  I'm more  In the preparation  Sort of  I do think about it more  I do think  Not that I want my kids  No obviously kids  Can't see this movie  But I do want them  To know about it  And know about  Possible dangers  And to be aware  Yeah yeah  You're one of the most  Varied actors  It's amazing  The range you have  The only other guy  That I think  Plays that range  Is maybe  Gary Oldman  It's like  From Les Miserables  To Wolverine 
[02:38:00]  It's like you really  There's nothing  You don't seem to want to do  You know  Yeah that's true  There's nothing  I'll do anything  To stay employed  I'll do anything  I'll do anything  I've never had a typecast  Six foot koala suit  For about a year  Promoting  That was for 12 bucks an hour  Trust me  I'll do anything  Really  Yeah and the person before  I think had thrown up  You know  That was not  You're not worried  About being unemployed  Hugh Jackman's not worried  About being unemployed  Maybe not right now  Okay  You're doing good  Oprah loves you  But people will never 
[02:38:30]  Get bored with you  And they'll never  Get sick of you  Because you don't  You can't be typecast  You're like  Oh he's doing that again  It's always something different  Which is amazing  Well that's sort of what I love  And I think actually  Part of the good thing  About growing up in Australia  And getting into the business  In Australia  Is there is no genre  There's no like  Oh I'm just going to make a career  In Australian action movies  Because there's one made  Every three years  Right right  So you've got to do theatre  You've got to do everything  I mean a lot of people  Don't know Russell Crowe  Did musicals in Australia  When he started  And you know  We all did TV  And whatever  Well yeah  And he's got that band 
[02:39:00]  That he goes around with  Exactly yeah  As far as music goes  Was the acting  Or music first with you  Acting  It was acting  Oh yeah  When I graduated  I did theatre school  Like straight theatre school  And where I was at  There was a musical theatre school  As well  They were all still  Really annoyed with me  We did that bit  What are you doing  Taking our jobs  But when I first went  For a musical  Audition  I thought my agent  Was on drugs  But you know  I was really small  And I was like  Yeah I'll go for anything  You know  And that was 
[02:39:30]  Beauty and the Beast  It was Beauty and the Beast  Yeah  And they couldn't find  A six foot guy  Who was sort of  Big enough to play the part  And so I went in  And went for it  Did you just have to  Sing in the room cold  Luckily I read first  And I remember it very clearly  I had to read the scene  And then sing  And when I read the panel  I could see  They were like  Yeah this could be the guy  Oh god  He better be  And then I sang  And I could see  Their faces fall  Like  And so I'm the only actor  I think  Ever  In professional history 
[02:40:00]  To have it in his contract  That I had to have  A singing lesson  Once a week  And they paid for it  Wow  So for twelve months  I had to go and do it  And I had to check in  And I learned how to sing  During the show  Because you did  You're like  Obviously  We've seen you on  The Tonys and stuff  And you do a great job  Singing  And that wasn't  I thought that was  Kind of a natural ability  Not learned  No you had to  All learned  Do you know how good looking  You have to be  For them to go hire him  We'll teach him to sing  You don't think  They would teach you  To sing Jimmy  No not even if they needed  Like a mushy guy 
[02:40:30]  Who blinks a lot  And sings  Would they hire me to sing  And by the way  Mushy  Mushy  Just me  I'm just mushy  Mushy  Oh he thought it meant  So he was hoping  It didn't mean  What it actually meant  It was physically  Fairly disastrous  And the Tonys is alive  Yeah  How horrifying is that  To  The first time  I was pretty freaked out by it  Yeah  But you know  I'd done a lot of theatre  That sort of  Was my background  But you know  The great thing is  You walk out  To 7,000 people  At Radio City Music Hall 
[02:41:00]  And they are just  So excited  I mean  I did that  Three years in a row  And then I  Was asked to do the Oscars  And I never would have  Done the Oscars  If it wasn't for  The Tony Awards  But I always remember  The crowd in the house  Is just so there for you  They are so up for it  It can be really deceiving  Because you can be bombing  And you won't know  You really don't know  And remember the Oscars  Remember that famous  Snow White Rob Lowe thing  Right  Everyone says  It's the most disastrous 
[02:41:30]  I've ever seen  The Oscars  Right  Yes  And people said  Watch this  Is what not to do  Right  And I watched it  And at the end  Standing ovation  Really  From the crowd  And literally  When I did my opening  Of the Oscars  And they stood up  I was like  Oh shit  Snow White  It's over  It seems really hard  In award shows too  A lot of times  They have very scripted  Things that they're  Reading off teleprime  And it just seems  Like a really hard  Thing to pull off  Even for great actors  It's just like  So what do you think  It'll be  I don't know  Betty  What do you think  It's really cringing  Sometimes  Yeah 
[02:42:00]  No  And people  The worst thing  You can do  Is people throw  The writers under the bus  Like actors  Don't you hate that  When actors  They haven't prepared  They haven't done anything  So they're doing  The  Swinging  Yeah  Yeah  Oh the writers  You know  I'm like  That's not  Why  George Volta told me this  He said  There's a kind of  He says  When you turn up  You turn up  If you're not going to  Turn up  Don't go  Right  Right  And he said  There's a kind of  Trend sometimes  Some people think  It's cool to mumble  And make it look like  You don't care  I'm not part of this 
[02:42:30]  Teleprompter  Award thing  And he goes  If you like that  You don't go man  You know  People at home  You're part of showbiz  This is showbiz  Yeah  So if you're not  Going to do it  Don't  I think he's right  So be  Yeah  Be professional  How long was that  Last opening number  For the Tonys  How long did that run  That was a  Oh as far as  Neil Patrick Harris  Yeah yeah  Neil Patrick Harris  How long was that  That went on  For like a while  How long of a rehearsal  Would somebody have to go through  To have that work  I gotta tell you  Neil  I know Neil 
[02:43:00]  Because I did a little part  With him in it  And he literally moves  His whole family to New York  For five, six weeks  For the Tonys  I hope he doesn't mind me saying this  Five, six weeks  He watches every show  He starts looking through  He starts  You know  We did a bit together  And we didn't really know  What it was  And he kind of made it up  He actually devised  The whole thing  So he works really hard at it  It's a good solid five, six weeks  Now when you watch something like that  Will you go like  Alright I don't want to host anymore  Or will you go  Okay I'm going to  No but I mean  Or you watch it and go  I'm going to be better than that 
[02:43:30]  When I do it  I don't think I'm going to be  I certainly don't think  I'm going to be better than Neil  Because I think that guy's owning it  I think that guy is  That opening was ridiculous  He's fantastic  It was unbelievable  He's great  Because he can sing, dance  But he's quick and funny  And he keeps it going  I think he's right up there  With the Billy Crystal  To be honest  I think he's great  But I often think  I'd like to do it again  But yeah  Maybe I'll just put a few years  In between Neil and myself  Wait for someone to really bomb  Because it will happen  Yeah I'm smart enough to know  Don't go straight enough to Neil  Hey as far as working out goes 
[02:44:00]  And stuff  You've been on screen  Where you look slight  And then you've been on screen  Where you look like  You've been  You're an Olympic weightlifter  Are you talking to me or you?  Jimmy Norton  Yeah of course I'm talking to Jim  What kind of regimen do you need  When you're doing like Wolverine  And it's  You know now I know what it is  It's taken me seven movies  To really work it out  But it's really  You need a year  A year  Yeah  You need a year  I'm 40  About to be 45  So you just can't change your body 
[02:44:30]  That quickly  If you want to put on muscle  And keep fat off  It's easy  Relatively easy  To put on weight  Muscle and fat  At the same time  Because you just eat  Everything in sight  It's kind of fun  Yeah yeah  Really they say  One pound of muscle a month  Is all you can gain  If you're not going to gain fat  So you need  You know  Put on 15-20 pounds of muscle  Wow  And so you need  Three hours a day  You need to eat  5,000 calories a day  A very strict  And three hours in the gym a day  What's that?  Three hours of the gym  Yeah 
[02:45:00]  A day  Yeah  Would you do things  Like I heard Edward Norton  Was doing like meat shakes  When he was doing  American History X  So just these awful  Awful things  I've heard of people doing that  Like they can't eat  The tin tuner anymore  So this one guy I know  Put it in like a  A blender  Mix a blender  Right  And blended it up  To thinking it'll go down easier  And the tuna threw up immediately  Yeah  The tuna fish milkshake  Yeah it's not a good beverage  Tuna fish  No  You know  You can just do protein shakes  But you can't  You can supplement with one maybe  But you've really got to do the food 
[02:45:30]  When you're not doing a roll  That requires you to really bulk up  Yeah  Do you still have to pay attention  To what you're eating all the time?  Well it's interesting  I kind of  I've always known  There's another Wolverine coming  It's the first time in my life  Where I don't know  I don't know  I'm doing another one  Wow  I've just finished shooting  X-Men Days of Future Past  There's no script for anything further  I'm not sure  Right  If they want me  I'm not sure  What's going to happen  So you eat a few donuts now?  Yeah  Yeah  It's kind of frightening to me  How much I enjoy it  I could easily go off the wagon 
[02:46:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  How have comic book fans treated you?  The book you hear is fantastic  No  Have that response  You've been good about it  Because comic book fans  Can be very very harsh  They're very critical  They're brutally honest  I actually love that  Yeah  As an Aussie  I like to get it straight  So you know  They generally  Generally  I think they really dig the Wolverine  They liked it  They liked the direction they're going  And they didn't dig the first one  And they'll all tell me  Wow really?  Yeah  And even the ones  Who have sort of been polite before  Will say it now  Oh thank God for the Wolverine man  Because we didn't like the last one 
[02:46:30]  You know  They just didn't like  Whatever  They were expecting  A movie more about the character  And there were a whole lot  Of other mutants  And they were  Right right right  Yeah  But you know  Ultimately they've been  Very very supportive  Yeah yeah  And thank God  Because they would spit on me  In the street  Yeah yeah  They aren't  Oh my God  Are they brutal  Yeah  By the way  I don't read the blogs  Comments  No no huh  I don't go there  Yeah  It's like  I don't either  I mean  Oh jeez  Seriously  Yeah I do 
[02:47:00]  But I mean  It's horrible to read  All this negative  Did you read it?  Yeah because  I try not to  But then all of a sudden  I'll read one negative thing  And I'll be like  I'll look him up  And then  Oh fuck  I mean  I just  It's so stupid  To put that energy  Into such nonsense  Who cares?  It's good to know  Hugh Jackman has haters  Yeah  Makes our lives a little easier  But it also makes it depressing  Like if there's people  That are bashing you  It's like  We have no shot  At anything  We have no hope  Right  There's people criticizing  That performance  Oh God  People just like to criticize  I don't know  Did he get to you  On Twitter and stuff like  He's a real Hugh Jackman 
[02:47:30]  On Twitter  And does he get to you?  Do you read all the  At mentions?  I don't read them all  Obviously  But you know  I went on to that  Because I was doing  A one man show  In San Francisco  And I wanted people  Who were into  I know a lot of people  Don't know I ever  Sing and dance  Right before  So I wanted them  To know I was doing  The show  And so now  I'm in a relationship  But I feel like  Oh shit  I didn't know  I was getting into  A relationship  I'm in a relationship  Now  Oh and they're mad  Well you haven't  Tweeted in a week  I'm like sorry  Sorry  Let's go on a date  Whatever you want  You know  All of a sudden 
[02:48:00]  Now you're  You know  You have to deal with  These people  I'm sorry  I'm tweeting  I'm sorry  I need to give them  Full attention  You know  Or if you retweet  One person  They all want to retweet  Like if you're retweeting  Him  It's my birthday too  Ultimately I think  It's fine  I think it's probably  A good thing  You know  If you've got  Something to say  You can say  You can shoot  Something down  That's true  It is odd  That people have  Such accessibility  To celebrity now  It's you know  Years ago  We always talk about  That how you would  Have to write a letter  To Clark Gable  Or something  And actually 
[02:48:30]  Address it  Mail it  It would have to  Get through an army  Of people  And now you could  Just be like  You suck  Yeah  People often say  You know  When I wrote  To Clark Gable  I got a letter back  And a signed photograph  He was such a gentleman  And I'm like  It was so easy back then  Yes  Clark Gable had no idea  He got letters  None  No there were people  In the studio  Just signing them up  You see  What's that Joan Crawford movie  Mommy Dearest  Where they're out by the pool  She's got like  Five people sitting around  Signing her pictures  And dumping them  In their hole 
[02:49:00]  Yeah  In the mouth  I gotta tell you  This isn't even a question  It's one of these  Awesome things  Or something  The prestige  Has to be  On my top  Friggin'  Five movies  Of all time  And I think  It's an underrated movie  Yeah  I agree  That to me  Should have been  Huge  Yeah  No  It's made by  The great Chris Nolan  Batman fame  And you know  He  I thought it was great too  I think  A couple of things happened  There was  A hit that came out  A few months before  The Illusionist  The Illusionist 
[02:49:30]  Came out  Right  And that was a hit  And it was like  It was confusing  A magic movie  It came out  And everyone saw it  And then Alice came out  And it was like  You guys  Come from the Illusionist  And it was so  They were so different  It's interesting  I get a lot of people  Come after me  Saying  I've turned so many people  On to that movie  And when they watch it  They're just like  That's a fantastic movie  Christian Bale  Bill was amazing in it  And David Bowie  Right  Yeah  Yeah  Michael Caine  Yeah Michael Caine  It's a bloody double  Yeah 
[02:50:00]  Fantastic  I heard a great thing  From him on that movie  Did you  We were doing a scene together  And the crew  Bless you  The crew were laughing  At something  Out loud  And everyone goes  Great  Let's move  And he goes  Let's go again  We've got to go again  I said  Why are you  It was great  And he goes  If the crew were laughing  It won't be funny on film  He said  Funny on film  Has to be smaller  Way smaller  Otherwise it's too big  For the screen  Yeah  And then he said  Ah what do you know 
[02:50:30]  I said  People are laughing  I'm there  We're talking about  Bob the Grip  He laughs  The Grip is laughing  Come on  Wow what an amazingly  Smart way to look at it  Right  The crew laughing  It might be good  For the ego in the moment  But it's not what  You're going for  Right  Wow  It's pretty brave  Yeah  To think that way  Right  All I want to talk  To Michael Caine  About is how  Attractive he was  In Dressed to Kill  What a great movie  That was  Running around  With the wigs  Slashing people  Of course  Oh he's just fantastic  Well you know  At a movie 
[02:51:00]  There aren't many laughs  And I've got to say  Prisoners  It's not a romantic comedy  I'm bringing it  Right back around  It's a really good movie  I don't know  If we even promoted it  Probably  It's a really good movie  It is this Friday  Obviously the 20th  And Jake Gyllenhaal  Is also  He's awesome  Oh right  Yeah  Jake Gyllenhaal  Is in it  It's really fantastic  Yeah yeah  It's a great cast  Paul Dannem  Melissa Leo  And Terrence Howard  Viola Davis  That creep  Oh my god  Don't give it away  No no  I'm not saying a word  I am not 
[02:51:30]  Are you  When you film something like this  Are you nervous  The first time you see it  Or do you kind of  Watch the dailies  Or do you never watch them  No  I'll occasionally watch  You know  They'll have monitors on set  And I'll occasionally watch that  But I watch it less  When you're with a great director  Because at the end of the day  The hard thing about acting is  It's a director's medium  It's not your job  You do your job  And you give them  Five options of a scene  And they choose  Their one  You don't go  No one invites the actor  Into the editing room  To say which one  Do you think is best  So it's always 
[02:52:00]  A little nerve wracking  Because unlike stage  You're giving your performance  To someone else  To edit  And chop  Have you ever thought  Like oh man  I wish they would have used  Another take  Occasionally  To be really honest  Quite often  I'm like man  That scene was not as good  When we shot it  As they made it  Oh wow  I know  I've been lucky  Good editors can make things funny  And I go  I don't remember them  Oh really  Yeah with timing  Wow  They can fix your timing  If your timing's off  They can cut things  That really don't work 
[02:52:30]  If your acting sucks  Amazing  They can play on the other actor  Say what he notices  You know  They're the most underrated people  In Hollywood by the way  Are editors  Yeah yeah yeah  The most difficult thing is that  Breaking news  We heard you want a Cronut  This is a Cronut creator  Are you kidding me  He's the guy  That's the guy  This is so bizarre to me  Because I go past your shop  And they are around the block  And I think  I wouldn't mind one  But I'm not going to wait there  For anyone else  Exactly  In fact  Did you come to me  I didn't tell you came to the bakery  Huh  Somebody could go to me  Oh no  I go by there many  No  What happened was 
[02:53:00]  At one point  I wanted one  And I went there  I was waiting  And then someone waited for me  And all of that  Oh okay  Someone actually  Who worked with me  Went to go in  Sorry guys  How many Cronuts are there by the way  There's three  Well this is awkward  Oh boy  There's four people  Please  Have a Cronut  With a fig  Look at this  Is that what that is  With a fig  Hold on  Let me get a mic on you  There  Right now  All right  Here we go  No thank you  No thank you 
[02:53:30]  Enjoy  Oh my god  Yeah  Hugh Jackman is trying a Cronut  Pretty good  There's a good  I cut a piece of  There's jam in there  And mascarpone cream  I really do guess  He's not doing another Wolverine  He's shoving Cronuts in his face  That's an hour in the gym  You just did  Yeah yeah  That's an hour  That's an hour  Just five minutes  For a minute  Just five minutes  Yeah I'm gonna lay the rest

That was really cool  The portable souffle  Wow  Wow  See  That's now  Now I've got something to take home  That my family can be happy with  That's another hour in the gym though  Yeah yeah  You can be in the gym all day now  Just another five minutes  Exactly  There's not much  By the way  The nerve of me  Hugh Jackman takes a bite  So I'm like  It's okay for me too  Like we're on the same  We have the same bodies  That we're working with  That's what you do 
[02:56:00]  I'll eat something  And I'll see somebody  In perfect shape eat it  I'm like  Oh if you  Well if he's eating it  I can you know  By the way  There's a couple of tips  I learned about this  Yeah  Statistically  If you go to town  If you go to town for breakfast  Like people go to town  For dinner  Yeah  And it is  So much harder  For your body  To come back from that  Because you're going to sleep  Right  So you just  You're never metabolic  But you can almost  Like if I'm on a vacation  I have to stay in shape  I'll go to town for breakfast  Yeah  And then the rest of the day  Stay good  And your body will be fine 
[02:56:30]  Yeah I won't change  Are you good at making yourself  Like go to the gym  If you don't want to  Because I found that  If I don't have something scheduled  I just  I literally will find a way  To not do it  Well if I wasn't  If I  If I was in your shoes  I wouldn't go  But you've got to remember  On May 28th  When the movie comes out  I'm on a 40 foot screen  Right  You know  And then I'm like  I really should have gone  So it's just  It's total fear  Have you ever seen yourself  And a little bit of  Yeah  And not liking yourself  Did you watch the first X-Men  Because I had three weeks  To prepare for that  There's a scene  In the middle of that 
[02:57:00]  Which is we shot first  Me going down that blue hallway  Yeah  Trust me  There is nothing superhero about  And the director told me  He didn't tell me the time  He said  Yeah man  I had to shoot around  I was shooting up  We're getting a glimpse  Of the shoulder  Holy shit  Really  Yeah I was a little flabby  No I'm going to have to watch that  Right  And so what he did was  He goes  The first scene in the cage  I'm going to shoot that  The last day  And you've got four months man  To get into shape  And I said  Yeah but people are going to  Get to the middle of the movie  They're going to see that thing  And he goes 
[02:57:30]  No  That's not how it works  The people's minds  They'll love you already  No  They only see  The first image  So no one  Even people who have seen that movie  Remember me in that first image  Right  From the cage  And they don't even think about it  From that moment on  That would be funny  You watch it now  And realize you look like  John Candy  It's like  Wow he was  Geez I never noticed  They're saying  He has to leave  Yeah he's got to go  Of course  He's very busy  This was great for us man  That's my trainer  Yeah yeah yeah  They're feeding him

[03:03:00]  Audio entertainment  Courtesy of the people you hear  And hear about  On the Opie and Anthony Show  This week  Rich Voss  And Bonnie McFarlane's podcast  My Wife Hates Me  Bonnie just finished up her week  At the creek  How did that go, Bonnie?  My week at the creek  How did that go?  It was good  It was really good  Very useful  Worked out a lot of new bits  Got a lot of new bits in my act now  A lot of new bits  A lot of new bits  What was the highlight of the week? 
[03:03:30]  I don't know  I had some  I don't know  Well you  You gotta know the highlight  Keith and the girl  Kane  That's a pretty big highlight  Two different nights  Yeah  Famous podcast  Yeah  Keith and  They're both very, very nice  Kemdra  Kemda  Kemda  I think it's Kemda  Kemda  Who's very nice  Very supportive of comedy  They're both very supportive of comedy  So they stop by  And John Troosen  Booker for Governor's Comedy Club  Stop by  With Tim Gage 
[03:04:00]  Cousin to Colin Quinn  Who also did a week at the creek  Who did?  Tim Gage  He didn't do a week at the creek  Yeah he did  A couple weeks before me  He did a week at the creek  Why are you so  He did a week at the creek  An hour?  He did an hour?  I guess so  He's a funny dude  So you had  I didn't really do an hour every night  Because I started late  Sometimes I had people do ten minutes in front of me  I opened up in front of you one night  One night I went ten minutes short  Um  Yeah 
[03:04:30]  Because it's a weird room  It's like  It's  It's not like a comedy club  Like you go to a comedy club  There's  It's a different energy  It's more  Like  Like  Late back  I can't explain it  Yeah  You're just like reading your jokes off a paper or something  No you were  Like when you're practicing new ones  You were reading them off the desk  No but I'm saying even if you weren't  It's got that feel of like  Very sort of like  Coffee house or something  And then all the  You know  Then you did a couple other hipster rooms 
[03:05:00]  That you  Very  Yeah  So Brooklyn  Brooklyn's a weird place man  It's like  So  It's almost like third world  But with like a lot of entitled white people cruising around  You know  I don't even do those rooms  And I don't like them  Because I don't like  The added  Although I like to creek and cave  When I went on there  It's a funny attitude  Because they're like  It's almost like  I don't know  They're not used to real funny  They're used to obscure funny 
[03:05:30]  Okay but here's the thing with you  Is that you're like  You're as bad as them  On another  No  Yes  Because they're like  Ugh I don't like that kind of comedy  And you're like  They don't know real funny  I mean  It's subjective  Comedy is whatever hits you  Whatever you like  That's true  It is subjective  But if you're  But if you just dismiss  What other people like  But if you have only been introduced to a certain type  And you don't know  Listen if you've only eaten meatloaf your whole life  Then you know  That's what you eat  Meatloaf  So if you're introduced only to this type of comedy 
[03:06:00]  And you never  Say you've only been to that  It's impossible to be introduced only to this type of comedy  Yeah in a club  Because people watch it on television  Or on YouTube  Television comedy stinks  But if you went to that kind of club  And never went to a Gotham  Or a comedy cellar  Or a Carolines  Then you wouldn't know  What to compare it with  Right  So  But I gotta say  Sometimes when I'm in a club  Look I don't think  All alt comedy is great  A lot of it's really bad 
[03:06:30]  A lot of it's very annoying  But when it's good  It's really good to me  It hits a certain thing in me  That's like I really like it  They're mean audiences  The same thing happens  When I go into a comedy club though  Sometimes I'm sitting there  Watching the MC  Or the first act on  Or whatever  And I'm like  Why are these people just sitting  Like  I expect the audience to get mad  Like  I'm not gonna sit through this  Like I'm thinking like  What are they thinking like  There's stinkiness in both  There's stinkiness everywhere  There's stinkiness everywhere  So  There's good and bad in both  In both groups 
[03:07:00]  Right  You should be  You should  And I'm sure people  Watched me and thought  Like ugh  On both sides of it  Oh don't bring me into this  I didn't  Oh  I actually used the term me  I was saying  I was one of those people  That watched you dummy  Oh  What I'm saying is  People don't  Expand  Thank you for calling  Thank you for insulting me  And calling me dummy  That's a double insult 
[03:07:30]  People don't expand the horizons  Really  Is it horizons  Do you think  You just invented the term  You think you're helping people  Understand what double means  What was the thing  I came up with the other day  That's called the double insult  Everybody  What did I come up with  The other day  And you said  That's been around forever  In the car  I  Yeah  It's unbelievable  That I say  What's the term  For  Trans  I was trying to think  Because here's  How I'll set it up 
[03:08:00]  So  We were listening  About the Chelsea  Manning  Thing  Where  The guy who went to jail  For the WikiLeaks  He  Is now she  I mean he wants to be  Referred to as she  And they keep saying  That you know  Chelsea Manning  Has gender dysmorphia  Which  I was saying  Dysmorphia makes it sound  Like it's like a bad thing  Like it's a disease  Or something  It should be something  More positive  And I asked you  Could you think of a term 
[03:08:30]  That might be funny  That I could use in my act  And Rich said  Gender bender  And I go  Oh did you just make that up  Like as a joke  Because obviously  Everyone's heard the term  Gender bender before  And he goes  Yeah  I just made it up  What does gender bender mean  You made it up  You don't know  No  In your own mind  What did you think  When you thought  You were making it up  I can't believe  You've never heard  The term gender bender before  I knew I wasn't 
[03:09:00]  Making it up  That's been around  For a million years  Okay  It's bending your gender  It's going to the other side  You're a gender bender  Right  Well okay  So now explain to me  Why did you pretend  That you made it up  Because I was joking  All the way until right now  Because you go  You made that up  I go yeah  And then we dropped the subject  We didn't discuss it  For three days  No I did ask you  A couple times  I was like  Did you really think  And then we drove away  And we forgot about it  We didn't bring it up  During meals 
[03:09:30]  You really committed  To this joke  Hilarious  We didn't like  The other day  During dinner  Oh by the way  Do you still believe  You made up gender bender  You know  Now Bonnie can discuss  And I like to  You know I don't  Sometimes I find  I don't ask  Bonnie enough questions  And it's not fair  Oh my god  Do you find  You decided that yourself  Yeah sometimes I find  You didn't have  Someone else  No  An outsider telling you  No I don't listen  To outsiders  I make my own decisions  Oh really  Especially when it comes 
[03:10:00]  We were in a meeting  They said they listened  To five or six  Of our podcasts  And they said  You know what  You don't ever ask  Any questions  That's not true  I didn't even hear  That in the meeting  I just brought this up  I wasn't in the meeting  At that point  That's when I looked at me  You were in the meeting  At that point  And also  I said it  On the way  There  Well I don't remember  Any of it  I just figured  I need to ask you  A couple more questions  So people can find out  A little more about you 
[03:10:30]  And what I live with  Okay but I'm just  Trying to find out  Like what's real  And what's not real  Like did you really  Now I don't know  Because the gender bender thing  You were like  Led me to believe  You thought you made it up  This is the kind of comedy  You like  Obscure  Whoa  I don't understand  Where's this leading to  What is this doing to me  Do you really think  You came up with that  On your own  Can you see this pimple now  That I got the new makeup  You put so much makeup on  I think you're in  You're in transition 
[03:11:00]  I'm in transition  Where are you  In your transition  Yeah  I was  You've got gender dysmorphia  I was looking up online  And bosoms  And being  My pecs are pretty nice  Where you were looking at what  To get new bosoms  Okay wait  Try to  I don't understand  What you're talking about  You said to get  Oh this is more of your  Alt comedy  What  To bosoms  Titties  Bosoms  You're going to get boobs  A boob job  You go  Where are you at 
[03:11:30]  And I just said  I was looking online  At bosoms  I know but as a man  You could think  Oh you were like  Looking at  To get off  No  I was looking to get  Like porn  No  For my  For my operation  I get it now but  You ask the question  I give you the answer  And you don't know  Oh my god  That's why I don't ask you  Oh my god  So  Tell us about your  Experience with Air Canada  Oh shut up  Your whole vacation's ruined  Because of Air Canada 
[03:12:00]  Yeah I can't go to Canada  You can't go to Canada  It's not really their fault  It is  They lied  Well what happened was  They lied  I sent away my passport  I got it back  Because I had the picture  It was the wrong size  Don't you're mumbling  Speaking  Clearly  It's just so  I can't even talk about it  It's not even interesting  So then  It's interesting  I wasn't going to get my  If I sent my passport again  I wasn't going to get it back in time  For my trip back home to Canada  So  I went to the Canadian Consulate  In New York City  This was the whole day of the TMZ 
[03:12:30]  People are following along  And they told me that  I actually didn't need a passport  To travel to Canada  I just needed my green card  Rich  Are you kidding me?  Go ahead  Go ahead  That was like second knuckle in  That's disgusting  Go ahead  I'm listening  You're not listening  You're looking at the ceiling  And picking your nose  Like  I've never seen anyone  Do it that hard before  Oh  So  They said you have 
[03:13:00]  I'm working out some new  The border patrol  Let's you do it  But sometimes the airlines  Have a different policy  When it comes to green cards  When it comes to traveling  Just with your green card  So you have to call the airline  Make sure that you can travel  With just your  Green card  Green card  No passport  Okay  There's certain airlines that do  Certain airlines that don't  So  I book with Air Canada  And you talk to them  I talk to them  I booked my flight  United  Talk to them 
[03:13:30]  Everybody  Said  Everybody said it was okay  Well  Not just like  Oh  Yeah yeah  No problem  It was like a question  That no one had ever been asked before  So everybody had to  Like go ask other people  You know  Whatever  And I think what happens  Is they just kind of  Give you an answer  Because they don't know  So they don't feel like  Really  They were like  Do you have a birth certificate  Yeah  Because all of them  I had to tell them  That the border patrol  Says it's okay  Like I have a document  Yeah  From their website  Saying it's fine  And then they were like  Oh 
[03:14:00]  Because their immediate thing  Was no  You need a passport  Then they would like  Be like  Well  Do you have a birth certificate  I say yeah  Okay yeah  Yeah no problem  I booked my flight  So they all said yes  It came down to  They all said yes  Yes  It's fine  They said we can't  You might have a tough time  Getting home  You're going to get through  The border patrol  That's not  I said that's fine  I've already dealt with them  Whatever  Then I call  Just to confirm everything  To confirm things  After I've already booked my flight 
[03:14:30]  I'm supposed to leave  You bought insurance  I bought insurance  And they said no  You can't  They won't let me fly  They refuse  And they refuse to even like  Really like research it  Or look it up  Or whatever  I mean it was just really annoying  Okay  So I had to cancel my flight  And my insurance  Had already run out  Like for full cancellation policy  And now the insurance  Won't cover it  For  Whatever it's called 
[03:15:00]  Wrong documentation  And not only that  Air Canada  Would not refund her money  Would not refund my money  Because it's my fault  For not having the right documentation  I said I called and asked  And they said  Well anyone could call and ask  Anything  You know  They could just say they do  The thing is  They're like  Well we don't know you did  Well I've never talked to anybody  At an airline  That's like  Hey before we get started  Let me give you my  Reference number  If there's any problem

[03:31:30]  Unbelievable  That  What went on  During the VMAs  Last night  I've always had  This issue  With like  Music  Music can be  So gross  Sometimes  It's like  Well you mean  Actual music  The actual lyrics  Themselves  Can be  You know  Super raw  Dirty  You know  Whatever  And yet  If you said  Those things  On stage  People would be like  Oh she's just  A dirty comedian  And then 
[03:32:00]  They'll let  Their like  Thirteen year old  Listen to this music  It's so weird  And bizarre  And such a double standard  And then you start  Like I  I didn't watch the VMAs  But I looked online  This morning  At a couple of things  And it's just like  They're just  Fucking whores  I mean  They're so gross  I'm not trying to be  An asshole  But it's like  Put some fucking  Pants on  I mean  Why do they  Have to look  I mean  I don't understand  Why  The Beatles  Never did that  Like you're just  Going to be naked  At some point  If it continues 
[03:32:30]  Like this  And it's like  Do you think  The Supremes  Would ever come out  Like that  You know  The Supremes  Were fucking  Whores  And you know  What if I did  No I mean  I don't know  They're just like  I didn't see  The Lady Gaga one  But  I just saw a picture  Of her  It looked like  She was wearing  A G string  It's like  Are you kidding me  Like do you  Like I honestly  I don't know  Maybe when you get famous  Like it becomes a thing  Like hey  You've got to stay  In the limelight  So you've got to  Just do whatever  You can do  I don't know

[03:33:30]  Yeah I don't want  To be one of those  People that's like  Oh I just found it  Repulsive  But I kind of  Just  There's something  Really like  Gross about it  Well because  You know what it is  When you see talent  When you know talent  Like  Let me  Here's an example  Patrice  Whose new CD is out  Or coming out  But you could order it  On iTunes  Patrice would just sit  In a chair and talk  And you could see 
[03:34:00]  Pure talent  Yeah  Okay  Colin  Any comic  Can just  You could see the talent  They don't have to  Run around  And light themselves  On fire  And fucking  Rip off  You know  It's just  So there's musicians  That are so talented  That just sit there  Play  Sing  And I'm not saying  Don't  Don't have energy  Or have  You know  Some kind of stage  Show  But where do you  Draw the fucking line  You know  And  And then at these  Award shows  You know 
[03:34:30]  Which everybody's  Watching  One has to outdo  The next one  They gotta make out  They gotta finger bang  Each other on stage  They gotta dry hump  And then when the  I don't know  Who the rapper was  I know  But it's like  It's like  We're getting  Comedians get such  Like for  Having original ideas  Or maybe like  Some provocative thoughts  That we have  You know  Like oh how dare you  You know  And then it's like  These  I don't know  When they were singing  That song  Something thick 
[03:35:00]  Alan thick  With Robin thick  Robin thick  Yeah he comes out  He's looking super cool  But then when  Super fly y'all  And then she's like  But when that  Black rapper came out  I don't know  Who that was  And they were  He was singing  And the dancers  That's  They were fucking  Doing it  The black dancers  And him  Kind of like  Saved  Saved these other two  From complete embarrassment  They took the focus  Off of them  And there was some  Real good dancing  You know  Blacks are good dancers 
[03:35:30]  You saw that  Oh my god  I'm gonna have to  End this podcast  To end this marriage  Why  You don't think  They're better dancers  They just  It's in their rhythm  From where they're from  They used  For rain  They would dance  Oh that's Indians  But you know  What I'm saying  That dude  When he came out  And they were dancing  Didn't I point it out  Say look how good  Look how good  They're dancing  Rich went to an  All black high school  I like to point that out  When he's being  Ultra racist  How am I being racist  You're generalizing  That's racist 
[03:36:00]  That's not racist  It is  Oh really  Yeah  Okay  To say all black people  Can dance  I didn't say all  I said  You know they can dance  They can  And they can play ball  Who  You know  They love watermelon  No that's racist  Oh okay  Well how is it  I don't understand  The difference  Because the whole  Watermelon fried chicken  Thing is  Like everybody loves  Watermelon fried chicken  Right  But that's  You know  Tonight  Let's get some fried chicken  Oh you don't eat red meat  When are you going  To  The other day  He goes into the store  To get me some noodles  And he got me chicken noodle soup 
[03:36:30]  It's like  Are you ever going to  Accept the fact  That you don't eat meat  No what  Every time  He's like  Can you  Let's share chicken this  Let's eat chicken that  Guess what I heard  There's a new  Jamaican place in town  If it's open  We'll go eat there tonight  Because they have  Seafood  Jamaican seafood  And I heard  It's right in town  A new place  And we have to support  Local businesses  What time do you leave tomorrow  Early  Very early  Headed to North Carolina  Going to play 
[03:37:00]  Pinehurst tomorrow  Well you should take  Raina tonight somewhere  Why are you trying  To get me out of the house  I don't know  Because I got to  Just clean up  This whole house  The house is clean  It's so disgusting  Are you kidding me  Is there something  Wrong with you  You know what it is  Oh I know  Because  Here's  And this might start  A fight  And maybe  I'm off base  But whenever  Probably  Whenever I leave  To go on the road  She cleans the house  Spotless  Like companies  Coming over  No because  I like to be 
[03:37:30]  In a nice clean house  This is  What's wrong with this  I don't  I can feel like  On my feet  When I walk around  There's crumbs  On the floor  That's why you  Wear slippers  Oh brother  I love though  That you'd never be like  Let me help  Let's do this  Oh I didn't help  Last night  Oh my god  I said  Can you help  And you got so mad  No I didn't  You did  No I didn't  You were like  A four year old  No  No  No  You know  What Bonnie's  Problem is  And then  And then by the way  You didn't help  I didn't  No  I swept 
[03:38:00]  And I mopped  And I even went  The extra yard  And mopped in here  Okay  Yes I did  I mopped all through here  Why would you mop  Before you sweep  Because you didn't  Look like you needed  To be swept  So I mopped  Because I swept  The other day  When you weren't home  I was sweep  I swept up  The other day  And Bonnie's problem  Is like  I could be doing something  And she'll go  Drop that and do this  No  Because  No  Shut up  That's what you did  You say  But the reason is 
[03:38:30]  Is because  You'll see me  Slaving away  We had like a time frame  That we were going to  Play games with Raina  Until it was time  For her to go to bed  Or whatever  You made a time frame  And your time frame  So what  Let me tell you something  Without fighting with you  But your time frames  Are ridiculous  Because she stayed up  Until 1230 last night  So we didn't have to have  That stringent time frame  Okay  Because  She didn't go to bed  I didn't want to be  Cleaning the house  At 10 o'clock at night  Well don't use Raina  To say  Not because Raina  Had a time frame  No but then I wanted to clean 
[03:39:00]  All I wanted to do  Was clean up the dishes  From dinner  Stop  You should be an attorney  You should be an attorney  I wanted to clean the dishes  But okay  Right after dinner  We didn't get a chance  To clean up  Because we went  And played tennis  Okay  Then  That's what we're going to do  We should do that after this  Fine  Whatever you want to do  Tennis  Anything  See  I'll just say yes  That's the kind of person I am  I'll be like  Why  Because you want to  I got to do it now  No I said  We should play tennis  I didn't say you have to  Well last night I said  What did you say 
[03:39:30]  Before by the way  I said  What do you want to do  Clean the bathroom  Or  Dust  When you said  This was last week  Oh you're putting it out last week  Yes  Because this is what happened  And then you were like  Dust  I guess  I can do that  Well I put the stuff out for you  Which sat out  For three days  No  Without moving  You didn't even  You didn't even like  Sneakily put it back  You  I ended up doing it myself  No because I had my daughter 
[03:40:00]  Do it that night  I told her to dust  Okay  Well guess what  I did it  You did it over her dusting  Because she did it  Well then  She didn't do a very good job of it  And the reason I didn't dust  Because I was going to  And also  That doesn't get you out to  Oh I got my oldest daughter to do it  Whoa whoa whoa  You don't get your oldest daughter  To clean my house  Back up  It's weird  Why didn't I dust that night  Because what was I doing  I don't know  I'll tell you  Going to put air in the tires of your car  And putting oil in it  Oh  Oh  Well thank you 
[03:40:30]  But sometimes you still  You need to do two or three things in a day  Look at that  See  I'm saying like what  It wasn't in a day  I was on the time frame  It was running late  Then there's the next day  No it was running late  Look  Stop  You're not  Last night  When we came back in  And I had to do all the dishes  And everything  All I said to you was  Hey can you sweep up a little  And you were like  Oh  You acted like  I was asking you to like  I don't know  Do some huge  Enormous thing  Like what
