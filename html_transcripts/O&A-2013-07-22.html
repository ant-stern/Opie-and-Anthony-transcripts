<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton establishing their unapologetically explicit and unrestrained radio style.  They discuss a previous, supposedly "gay," appearance by recurring guest Andrew Dice Clay.  The conversation quickly shifts to a mocking critique of Geraldo Rivera's shirtless selfie, specifically the awkward positioning of his towel.  This leads to anecdotes about raccoons and their daytime habits, followed by a discussion of Jim Norton's jury duty summons and humorous schemes to avoid it.  The George Zimmerman verdict is then addressed, with Anthony expressing agreement with the verdict while acknowledging the racial complexities and expressing sympathy for the victim's family.  The media coverage and reactions from figures like Jesse Jackson are criticized.  The conversation veers off into humorous commentary on oranges and apples before returning to the Zimmerman verdict and Jesse Jackson's proposed Florida boycott.  Chicago's violence and New York's stop-and-frisk policy are discussed in the context of racial profiling, fueled by a video of a shooting at a Chinese restaurant and personal anecdotes from the hosts about their experiences in various neighborhoods, including Crenshaw Boulevard.  The segment concludes with mentions of Don Henley and Bob Dole's birthdays and the death of Helen Thomas.

The next segment opens with a discussion of a 92-year-old woman penalized for honestly answering a question about Israel.  This transitions into sarcastic commentary about Kate Middleton's labor and hopes for a disappointing baby.  The hosts then launch into crude jokes about Prince William, his brother, his father, Prince Philip, and the Queen.  A picture of a fainting British royal guard leads to discussion of the guards' rigid rules and lack of assistance to their fallen colleague. This is followed by the playing of a viral video featuring a black Mississippi politician delivering a highly offensive, yet eloquent, racially charged monologue criticizing a Trayvon Martin support rally.  The hosts praise the speaker's rhetoric.

Next, a series of Sean F.'s songs mocking co-host E-Rock's weight are played, specifically "Goldfish Back," a parody of Justin Timberlake's "SexyBack," eliciting E-Rock's visible displeasure.  The longest segment focuses on the fatal fall of a woman from the Texas Giant roller coaster, analyzing eyewitness accounts, news reports, and video footage.  The discussion expands to a broader conversation about roller coasters, including anecdotes, opinions, and descriptions of various rides, with one host identifying himself as a "roller coaster cuck."

The following segment continues the roller coaster theme, including discussion of a Superman-themed ride and various rides at Disney and other amusement parks, alongside a humorous suggestion for a "The Yawner" rollercoaster. A brief discussion about a guest's band playing at Epcot follows before returning to extreme rides, including a visual aid of a particularly intense, upside-down ride.  Kenny, a caller, is unexpectedly called for jury duty, leading to playful banter.  The hosts then promote their upcoming Just for Laughs festival shows in Montreal, detailing the schedule, venue, and a "midnight surprise show."  The conversation then shifts to a graphic discussion of cartel violence in Mexico, including descriptions of brutal murders and executions, prompted by news of a drug lord's capture.  The segment concludes with a return to the Montreal trip, their upcoming website, and a humorous segment on website design preferences.

The next segment begins with brainstorming YouTube channel names for Jim Norton, leading to suggestions like "Jim Norton Smiles."  The conversation turns to the anticipated arrival of Andrew Dice Clay, speculation about his relationship with Howard Stern, and one host's dislike for Dice.  A lengthy examination of Jim Carrey's elaborate website ensues, followed by a discussion of Dice Clay's absence (attributed to him being at Howard Stern's show), saltwater pools, Opie's Twitter habits, and the Netflix show "Orange is the New Black."  A lengthy discussion on S&H Green Stamps, old baseball cards, Pogs, and Beanie Babies follows, with a brief mention of a guest using the bathroom.

Andrew Dice Clay finally arrives.  A substantial portion of the remaining segment details Dice Clay's fitness routine, his preferences in women, and explicit descriptions of his sexual encounters, including discussions of twerking and specific sexual acts.  The conversation shifts to his new Woody Allen film, career resurgence, his podcast "Rolling with Dice and Wheels," its format, and anecdotes about filming in unusual locations.  Other projects, including a new talent show, are briefly mentioned, followed by promotional plugs for his podcast and stand-up shows.

A lengthy interview with Dice Clay follows, covering his new comedy special, positive feedback from Rodney Dangerfield's wife, his reluctance to do another special, and his upcoming book, "The Filthy Truth," co-written with David Ritz.  His weight loss journey, challenges with press, and his son's advice to "own it" are discussed.  He mentions various projects including a TV show and movie.  Listener calls follow, detailing experiences in Mexico, including encounters with corrupt police, cartel checkpoints, and witnessing decapitated bodies. Callers share anecdotes of robberies and harassment, highlighting the dangers of venturing outside tourist areas.  A call from Larry the Cable Guy recounts a story about his missionary neighbor whose family was carjacked in Mexico and the subsequent discovery of the carjackers' decapitated heads.  Larry and Sam Roberts debate the role of faith in dangerous situations.  The segment concludes with promotional plugs for Dollar Shave Club and the Montreal Opie and Anthony live shows, including the surprise stand-up show and ticket information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  Tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And sand.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  That would be good.  I would like that.  Is that the last time?  Yeah.  I guess that's the return of Dice today and the last time he was in here.  It was very gay in here.  The gay off last time.  I think he said, I'm going to go for a cigarette.  And he never came back.  Never returned.  I don't blame him.  I wish I smoked. 
[00:01:30]  There's a guy.  Do you see that guy out front every morning?  The kind of fat guy with a mustache smoking and chewing gum?  Oh, God, no.  Every day I see this guy.  Really?  Oh, my God.  He just looks like a disease.  That sounds awful.  A disease.  Dude, he stands there with his lunch bag in his hand.  I feel empathy for him because I smoke, but it's like, fuck, man.  That's just going to stink all day.  A cigarette and gum this early in the morning?  That sounds horrendous.  Doesn't it?  Not as bad as a selfie from Geraldo. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, that was great.  I don't care that he thinks he's in good shape.  And maybe he is, but what the fuck is he doing?  I don't know.  Why would you do that?  What did he do?  He took a selfie of himself, and he wanted to flirt with his pubic hair area, his pubis area.  Not only is he taking a picture shirtless, the towels weigh the fuck down.  Yeah, he's saying 70 is the new 50, and he's like, in front of the mirror, taking a selfie. 
[00:02:30]  He's 70?  Yeah.  But he's showing off his body at 70.  Look at this.  But look at that.  The towel is like way the fuck down, man.  Resting on his cock.  I don't like his Mr. Gazzo glasses.  He isn't in good shape that bad.  Yeah, but he thought it out.  Like, okay, I know I look even better with the glasses on, so let me get that.  He's got his big Geraldo head. 
[00:03:00]  And his stupid fucking mustache.  I hate these people that have to keep the mustache, because that's when they were really famous.  That they're known for, right?  So they've been known for that forever, so they can't shave it, because he just looks ridiculous with a big bushy mustache now.  Yeah.  Did our show once.  I think he hated us.  He hated me.  Yeah, he hated Jimmy.  Oh, that's right.  You got into a little racial thing.  That's Hispanic.  And then, as Opie and I were walking home that day, because he's saying how, he's saying that it was wrong to assume that, like, Mexicans don't learn the language. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Opie and I were walking home that day, and there's a bunch of Spanish workers in a building.  And we're like, hey, what are you guys doing here?  It was such a basic question when we asked them.  We couldn't even say good morning to them.  And we're almost trying to say that doesn't happen.  Whatever.  But he was showing off his body this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  That's like, selfies in general are kind of disturbing, I think.  Yeah.  Especially if you're, like, fucking shirtless, showing off your body.  What is he doing?  I don't know. 
[00:04:00]  He's in good shape, I guess, but he's old, so it's...  It's old man muscles?  What is that?  When Mr. Burns came out of the cake.  Right.  He kind of has that look.  But aren't you bothered that the towel's really low?  Of course I am, Opie.  He thought all this out.  Yes, he did.  It's like, oh, wait, I think I could, if I had the towel this low, I could get away with this.  That's the start of his pubis.  He must have had it around him higher and went, like, no.  Keep pushing it down.  No, no, I got to get, you know, my lower abs in. 
[00:04:30]  And the sort of V.  Yeah, I was just thinking, he has kind of a V at best.  Sort of V.  Oh, my God.  I want to know where raccoons go during the day.  We just started talking about this before the show.  I left the beach house at four this morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, I pushed it early.  I'm supposed to come back to the city, like, late Sunday night, but I said, ah, fuck it.  Why come back and deal with traffic when you can get up at 345 and jump in a car by four? 
[00:05:00]  Holy fuck.  Makes for a long day.  And then you realize you're not awake as you're driving 80 miles an hour towards the city.  Oh, my God.  That was a trip.  But last night, we're cooking steaks on the deck.  Sun's going down.  You got the ocean waves are crashing.  And then my sister, who's visiting, because we had that wake.  I had an uncle who died, and we had the wake Friday and Saturday. 
[00:05:30]  Wake and service.  So a lot of people are in the area.  So my sister came out for the day yesterday.  So anyway, we're having dinner.  And next thing you know, she goes, I saw a raccoon.  We're like, shut up, man.  There's cats all over the place.  The neighbor, I guess, has cats.  Yeah.  But sure enough, she was right.  It wasn't a fucking black cat.  It was a raccoon.  Yeah, there's a lot of raccoons on Long Island.  There are, right?  Yeah.  I've been told there's a lot of raccoons in the area I'm renting this summer.  Oh, yeah.  And my question is really simple.  Where the fuck are they during the day? 
[00:06:00]  Yes, they are nocturnal animals.  But where do they camp out?  You never see a raccoon's nest.  No.  So where are they?  And people are wandering around and checking out nooks and crannies all day long.  Why don't they come across a raccoon that's crashing during the day?  Yeah.  Where are they?  I think they do find little places like...  Where?  You know, in between a building or something.  So why don't we walk...  You know, why don't we bump into them during the day?  I don't know.  Did you pet one? 
[00:06:30]  Addicts.  I almost pet one by accident last summer, yeah.  It was in a kid's park.  They are nasty, mean things.  Mean motherfuckers.  They bark at you.  It was a heat wave last year.  Oh, they're adorable, though.  And I was at a kid's park, and they had like this kind of like this water, almost like  a river for the kids to play in, a tiny one that's...  The water's maybe two inches, you know, high.  And also, I see this thing to my left as I'm kind of watching my kid, and I go down to  kind of like maybe pet it, but at least take a look at it, and it's a raccoon, like right 
[00:07:00]  at my feet.  It was so fucking hot.  It said, fuck this.  I need water, and came out of the bushes, drank some water.  Everyone freaked the fuck out.  And then it just walked off like, you know, it didn't give a fuck about anyone, back into  the bushes.  Gotta watch the rabies.  They say that if you see them during the day, but I think it was so fucking hot, he just  needed a goddamn drink of water.  Yeah.  So, I don't know where they hang out during the day, though.  It bothers me.  It's very bothersome.  Look at how cute those are. 
[00:07:30]  Are they under houses?  They wear little burglar masks.  Yeah.  They go in attics.  You know that?  They go into some people's attics, hang out up there.  Really?  Yeah.  But what if you go into your attic, and you're looking for that old box of nostalgia?  I know.  Sometimes they pop back out, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  There you go.  I guess they just find their little places.  You know a little bit about everything, but you don't know where raccoons are during the  day.  And I had a raccoon problem a couple of years back. 
[00:08:00]  That's right.  I had a guy come in with traps.  He trapped them.  So, where were the raccoons during the day in your attic?  In my attic.  Oh, they did get in the attic.  A couple of them were in the fucking attic.  Wow.  There was more up there.  Nah, I think they're gone.  I haven't heard anything.  Yeah.  And then I saw him, that's mean, I saw him, one walking with a bunch of little ones following.  Oh, really?  He was walking, yeah, across my front lawn at night.  He was walking, and then the little ones following him. 
[00:08:30]  It's like, oh, that's fucking adorable.  A little raccoon family.  Yeah.  They don't bother you, though, do they?  They won't go out of their way to fuck with you.  Nah, unless they're fucked up.  They're creepy, man.  Yeah, if they got rabies, they'll fuck with you.  They got that weird hump when they're running across your lawn.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little, like, scoliosis.  Pushy ring tail.  Yeah, there he is.  A little scoliosis.  I don't know.  He just has a little hunchback.  A little spina bifida.  Right.  You think anyone has them as pets?  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[00:09:00]  Sure.  Here and there.  Yeah.  I'd pet one in a cage.  If someone held his head, I'd just stroke his back.  You can't.  When they're in a cage, they just are fucking mean.  I had one in a cage, and I was fucking with them.  And, man, are they mean.  I remember that video.  Yeah, lunging at the cage and fucking barking at me.  Pretty awesome.  He released him in the wild, right?  That's what he's saying.  Probably.  The old fucking 55-gallon drum of water.  Oh, my God.  Dunk the fucking trap in there.  Oh, man. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I think they've got to really adhere to some rules there where they could get in trouble.  They can't just kill them.  No.  This guy's saying they live in concrete structures during the day.  What?  What does that mean?  What a bunker?  John, what are you talking about there, John?  No, no, no.  I'm not.  All right.  So, here's how it works, man.  My friend works for animal control, and I actually had a raccoon in my yard in the middle of the day.  So, I called him up, and I was like, yeah, I'll kill this little bastard.  Would you?  So, he drives out to my house.  He's ready to go.  And he looks at me, and he's like, dude, he's not a rabbit. 
[00:10:00]  He's just lost.  So, apparently, especially in the northeast, if you notice around the northeast, we have  a lot of stone walls in the divide houses, like, you know, just the stone wall.  Yeah.  They've been there forever.  They live in there.  They've found, like, holes and stuff, and they burrow in there.  They call them raccoons' nests.  They actually burrow, and they build homes and structures inside those things, and multiple  raccoons will live in them.  In the cities and in places that don't have those, they find, like, not exactly a concrete  structure, but, like, a sewer drain or something like that, they burrow in, and they live 
[00:10:30]  in there in a nap.  Oh, sewer drains.  That's a good idea.  All right.  I just feel like people should be bumping into raccoons more than they do.  Well, they sleep during the day.  I know, but you're, especially kids, they're exploring and shit.  You would think you would come upon raccoons.  I bet there's a lot in the sewers.  They probably do bump into them, or come upon them, and then that fucking raccoon goes, like,  and the kid just runs away.  The kid runs away.  And then they tell you they saw a monster, and you're like, no, you didn't.  Relax. 
[00:11:00]  What's that?  Huh?  Mars has brought something to the program.  Mars, what's this video?  The raccoon being a bull guarding cat's food.  Oh, he's coming over to the cats.  There's three cats eating in a garage, eating out of a bull.  See the hump?  Yeah.  Dumb hump.  Whoa.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  You see?  Oh, now look.  Cats lose to raccoon every time.  They all move.  Oh, look at it.  He's using his little hands to eat, though. 
[00:11:30]  He's dunking the food in the water and then eating it.  He's washing his hands in their water bowl.  What a scumbag.  Oh, the cats are so pissed.  They're amazed.  They're like, we can't use our paws like that.  The raccoon, like, just takes a handful of cat food and puts it in the water.  And cats are nasty, man.  All three of them backed off at meat.  They're house cats, though, probably.  Oh, man.  That raccoon doesn't want to leave.  Or a guy walking with the cameras. 
[00:12:00]  This is free eats for me.  The cat's like, aw, get out of here.  It's on his hind legs.  He picked up a bunch of food and ran away on his hind legs.  He ran away.  That's very cute.  He just skedaddled.  He got greedy.  Yes, he did.  Was that World Star Hip Hop?  Yeah.  Wow, World Star Hip Hop or the raccoon video.  And the raccoon fucking blindsides the cat, punches him in the head.  Oh, right.  Jesus.  That's great.  I said, wait, so about the wild animal smell. 
[00:12:30]  I bet they could smell that this guy wasn't playing games.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not to be fucked with like the puppy in the house or something.  Yeah.  Don't screw with that wild animal.  I got fucking jury duty today, by the way.  Find me a jury.  Yeah, I got to leave by like 840, I guess.  Are you cutting out on us before the Dice Man gets here?  Yeah, I'm kind of bummed.  He's coming by today.  It's been a while since Dice came by.  Yeah, huh?  Have fun with that.  What time is that at?  I woke up this morning.  I hadn't said anything all day since I had woken up. 
[00:13:00]  There's no one to talk to.  So I go to the pisser there, and I go to take a piss, and I'm just taking a leak.  And the first words out of my mouth today were, Dice.  I just knew.  Yeah.  Like he was coming in, and I'm like, Dice.  Well, he's got ADD.  I know it's exhausting when he comes in.  He's got ADD.  He does have ADD.  We could talk about something for exactly 10 seconds. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  I've timed it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Try to get something going.  You got 10 seconds.  Oh, exactly.  And then you got to come up with another subject.  And then that subject will be done in 10 seconds.  10 fucking seconds.  10 fucking seconds.  How do I get out of jury duty today?  What do I do?  What's my move?  En-bomb.  En-bomb it?  Just drop one.  You'll be fine.  Wear a Zimmerman shirt when you go down there.  It'll be fine.  That'll be great. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do people get out of jury duty?  And does anyone enjoy jury duty?  Don't people try to get on the cases sometimes?  I guess.  Some people want to do a fucking jury duty case.  Yeah, I guess some people want to.  Those people are weirdos.  They are weirdos.  Pretty much everyone wants to get out of jury duty.  I'm going to go with talk show host.  Oh, that might work.  Excuse me, sir.  I'm a talk show host.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Controversial talk show host.  Controversial talk. 
[00:14:30]  Say controversial.  I'm just going to raise my hand and be obnoxious about it.  Excuse me.  Controversial talk show host.  I'm a controversial talk show host, and I can't keep my mouth shut about anything.  Yep.  I blab.  I'm a blabber.  But see, I think if you push it a little too much, then they push it to the back of  the room, too, right?  Yeah.  You've got to be really careful.  Yeah, because they might go, oh, talk show host.  Yeah, obviously we can't use him, but we're going to make him suffer because he was kind  of an asshole to begin the proceedings today.  Do they do that? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I think I've got to play it just right.  Do you have to go for one, two, or three days?  It could be for a month.  I mean, there's no trial.  It could be three days.  Sequestered.  Imagine if you were sequestered away from the show, your family, everything.  Is there any big trials?  Oh, man.  Getting ready to start up.  You miss a whole weekend out at the beach.  Oh, don't say that.  Oh, man.  That's all I want to do this summer, is just fucking sit on a beach.  For some guy who stole stock. 
[00:15:30]  Not even a fun one.  Oh, God.  Just some, like, banking electronic wiring.  Yeah, some really boring.  They have experts that go up and just, their testimony is hours and hours long, and it's  just about how the wired transfers of funds works.  I know.  That would suck luck.  Well, first, we need to get on the terminal, and we put...  Oh, and you're just like, oh, this is the most boring thing.  In reality, it's always a car accident. 
[00:16:00]  It's just always a dumb car accident with figuring out the insurance money.  Yes, that's pretty much nine out of ten of those things.  And then Mr...  Because I remember last time...  Mr. Brady comes out with a briefcase and drops it.  Yeah, yeah.  And Uncle Fester turns his head real fast.  Yeah, and AZT falls out of his briefcase.  Last time I came...  Last time I had to actually go to jury duty, then I...  We had a bunch of years there where we just kind of knew people.  Yeah.  But the world is changing, unfortunately. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, man.  And I was working at BAB on Long Island, and I actually got pushed into the little classroom.  Oh.  And it was down to about 20 of us, and then they started the case, technically, or the  one side did, to decide if they wanted you as a jury.  And it was a dumb car accident with fucking insurance claims.  Yeah, and they threw you out.  It was boring as all hell.  Oh, you did?  You actually sat in?  No.  Well, then what happened was, all of a sudden, there was some whispering.  Because I'm sitting there, like, seething. 
[00:17:00]  I'm like, get rid of him.  Fuck, I got too far.  I should have never left the big room.  So now I'm in the smaller room.  Yeah.  And then they're, like, they're starting to, like, ask questions in the smaller room.  And then all of a sudden, there was a knock at the door.  I'm like, oh, excuse me.  And then the guy comes in.  There's like, and I'm like, what the fuck is this about?  And then all of a sudden, the guy just looks up after really giving a fuck about everyone  in the room and said, you're all excused.  Oh.  All?  All.  You're all excused.  So I don't know what the fuck happened, but. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  Everything was tainted.  It's tainted.  And then all of a sudden, they're like, yeah, your paperwork's waiting for you with  a big fucking stamp that you served on your jury duty.  Oh, they must have said something that, like, fucking.  Fucked up.  Someone said something.  Fucked it up.  Yep.  So.  Fucked it up.  Oh, my God.  Fucking up the program.  You think I'll get one of those cases?  Some kind of Bernie Madoff fucking.  At least Bernie was the biggest crook.  Like, if you're going to get, or if you get, like, a Zimmerman trial, at least you know  it's a big trial.  There's nothing worse than some, just some technical jargon. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my God.  No.  Menial fucking.  At 5.30 on a Friday, you're still sitting there, and they're like, we're going to take  a 20-minute break and talk to the judge, and we might go late tonight, folks.  We'd like to bring up our own actuary.  Oh, my God.  And go through and explain to the jury in fine detail.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  That would suck ass.  Everyone's coming up with ways to get out of jury duty, but they've heard it all, so 
[00:18:30]  you've got to do it very carefully, I'm thinking.  They have heard it all.  They don't give a shit anymore.  And I think if you act up a little bit, they're used to people acting up, and they also have,  you know, a system in place where they throw you to the back or whatever.  They know how to deal with you people.  Yeah.  By the way, this is a weird coincidence, but, you know, the Flight 800 documentary and  all that, my neighbor, where I'm running a house this summer, he worked on the bodies 
[00:19:00]  back 17, 18 years ago.  As what?  A medical examiner.  And me, huh?  He's a dentist.  Did you ask him what he thought?  Yeah, he says it was the Navy.  He just says it was the Navy.  Yeah, he goes it was the fucking Navy.  Supposedly they were testing at 8.30 and what, it got hit at 8.35 or something?  Oh, boy.  Like, there's a record.  It was murder.  Supposedly they know for sure the Navy was testing shit at 8.30 and that plane was fucking  shot down at, I think, 8.35, five minutes later or something. 
[00:19:30]  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking.  He goes, oh, it was the Navy.  He has no doubt.  Someone fucked up.  Somebody Twittered something.  Remember we talked about, like, well, why would TWA allow them to say that?  And then somebody Twittered something smart.  I don't know if this is right.  He goes, insurance.  Because a lot of times in natural disasters of terrorism, insurance might not cover it.  Whereas with something like an engine explosion, insurance would cover it.  I wonder if insurance had anything to do with why everybody kind of went, oh, okay.  Right.  No, he has no doubt. 
[00:20:00]  He doesn't think it was terrorism at all.  He goes, nah, it was the Navy.  He doesn't know.  Right.  That's the fact that the FBI and fucking CIA got involved in something the NTSB should  have been in charge of.  Tells you right there, something's amiss.  Well, he said that there were people taking pictures, you know, for, you know, the job  that they had at hand.  And there was an official there that basically said, you know, stop taking pictures right  now.  And they're like, but we need to for what we're doing.  And they're like, no, stop immediately or there's going to be a problem. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, sound like Jimmy backstage.  Stop.  There's going to be a problem.  Stop taking pictures.  But no, I need these pictures.  I need them.  They're from my home.  My celebrities.  I don't know.  That's a, that really is a, I don't, I still can't know why they wouldn't just admit the  Navy made a mistake.  Oh, that's a big admission.  No, but I mean, what would the, like, what, what could happen to the Navy?  Nothing bad would happen to the Navy.  I mean, you're not going to, the Navy's not going away.  I don't know.  I don't think it's better to just kind of, you know, sweep it under the fucking carpet. 
[00:21:00]  Make it go away.  Or do you think it had started to get swept under and then by that point it was really,  it was like, what's worse than the lights, the cover up or the incense, the cover up?  Is there a copy of the documentary around?  Because this guy wants to see it actually.  A roll of fucking games.  He didn't even see the documentary and he was telling me it was the Navy.  It's on, it's on Epix.  Oh, it's on Epix now.  It's on Epix.  He doesn't get Epix.  He's an older guy.  How do you not get Epix?  I don't know.  You don't get Epix.  I get Epix.  Where's Epix?  You get Epix.  I don't get Epix.  People love it.  People keep saying like, hey, I watched it and it's like, oh, it really did make me think. 
[00:21:30]  Like, it's not like no one is writing going, oh, a bunch of shit.  No.  Because the people, the experts and stuff were too impressive.  Well, the filmmakers, they were great.  No, they didn't look like, didn't seem like they were weirdos or anything.  Like crazy people.  Why do we give a fuck about the royal baby?  We're in America.  We don't.  No, the news does look.  I know.  This should just be like an aside story.  Like, oh, and by the way, and of course, William and Kate are going to be keen to leave hospital  as quickly as possible. 
[00:22:00]  I got a good bid idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We call the hospital.  Nice.  And make believe we're the queen.  It's very disruptive.  And we try to get through to the Duchess.  And I think they'll retreat quickly home.  I hope she gets birthed.  I know.  I hope she gives birth to a dud.  Oh.  Just a dud.  Like our fucking husband.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  It doesn't mean there has to be something actually wrong with the kid.  Grandpa.  Just a dud in general.  A very mediocre baby. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm not even hoping for some horrible, very lackluster.  Just an ugly, mediocre baby.  Just a dud.  Yeah.  And they have to make believe it's good looking.  Yeah.  All that shit.  This is our baby, Shemp.  Right.  Exactly.  A Shemp.  God, I don't know why our news is all over it.  We're in America.  We gave up on those fucks so long ago.  We have our own royal family.  We don't give a fuck.  Jay-Z and Beyonce.  That's right.  Yes.  Royal family it is.  They are the royal family.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  And they're dedicating songs and everything to the Trayvon Martin.  Oh, yeah.  Aren't they?  Huh?  Out there with Reverend Al and the Martin slash whatever their names are.  Have you bought your merch yet from the mom's website there?  What happened?  Your Trayvon merch.  No, I'm not.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking t-shirts, buttons, fucking cell phone covers.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all money that goes to the Trayvon Martin Foundation, which I would love to get an accounting 
[00:23:30]  of where that money goes.  I bet that mom is loading up on fucking a little windfall that's come her way.  There it is.  The Trayvon Martin Foundation.  I wouldn't.  Join now.  As soon as they read the verdict, I moved on.  Let everyone else mop up and...  Mop up?  Well, we're in the mop up stage.  Yeah.  What does this mean?  Well, I don't know.  You tell me.  Well, I will tell you.  Well, the president got involved.  Yeah, we got the audio.  We should play it. 
[00:24:00]  I kind of liked it.  Did you?  Yeah, I know you're going to say you hated it.  I kind of liked that he put himself out there a little bit.  There were a couple of things that were very good, I thought.  Yeah.  That he said?  Sure.  My aunt and uncle love you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I think they want you in the family instead of me.  Oh, Jesus.  They love right-wing Anthony.  They go, oh.  This is what I get a lot when I go to family functions.  I saw your partner on Hannity. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, no.  And then I go, yeah, Hannity's been wanting me to go on, but I just don't like talking politics.  Which is true.  I don't have a side.  If you really need to know, I really don't.  Maybe I lean Democrat if I had to really write it down somewhere, but I don't really have a side.  And then I told him the whole thing where Hannity thinks I'm an Obama supporter just because I went on the air and said that Obama would be the president when everyone else is like, there's no way we'll have a black president.  But it was so obvious that the country was moving in that direction, and Hannity decided that means I'm an Obama supporter. 
[00:25:00]  I was just pointing out what I saw.  And then I go, I told my aunt and uncle, I'm like, I'm not an Obama supporter.  I told the whole story, and they're like, oh, thank God, we hate him.  Thank God.  Thank God we hate him.  I hate talking politics with family members.  I fucking hate it.  But if they met him, they'd be like, oh, he's a nice guy.  How can you hate him?  That's an exact quote.  And they're really nice people.  Extremely nice.  But they hate that man. 
[00:25:30]  A lot of nice people hate him.  Oh, yeah.  Plenty of nice people hate him.  But then she also believes in the Long Island medium.  And she goes, I don't care what you say.  I believe.  And I'm like, okay, good for you.  Whatever gets you through the day.  That's good.  In spite of any evidence you may present, she'll believe.  She likes magic.  In my humble opinion, the mediums are full of shit.  Uh-huh.  Because you can't just get messages from beyond that are vague. 
[00:26:00]  Wouldn't you have a crystal clear message?  Oh, it's very vague.  Not this vagary where you have to help out the medium with the actual answers?  Yes.  You gotta keep it from being so fuzzy.  You gotta pull it in a little.  How do they explain that?  No.  That's so stupid.  It's always fuzzy.  Oh, I am Trayvon T.  That kind of looks cool.  $25.99.  I'd wear that shit.  Nice.  And they're smart because they know in the hood you wear giant t-shirts.  Yeah.  So you could get them in 4XL. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, nice.  Why do they wear such big shirts in the hood?  I mean, they don't really as much anymore, but it used to be a big thing.  Yeah.  That's why they're very heavy people, too.  A long white t-shirt.  Really long.  Long whites are in.  Pretty smart, though, to all wear the same thing.  So if the cops are looking for somebody.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  They had a white t-shirt and blue jeans.  Oh, great.  10,000 other people.  That's racist.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Suzanne.  That was a smart thing.  I know.  Of course it is.  Suzanne is also going to jury duty today, Anthony.  Call me up. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  Yes, I'm going to jury duty in Nassau County today.  Good for you.  I did that about a year ago.  How was it?  I took off, I guess, who was here that day?  We had a guest.  I can't remember.  But I was listening to it on the radio on my way to a jury duty.  Yes.  I got out of it.  Well, I'll be listening to your Dice interview today.  I don't want to get out of it.  Yes.  I want to go to jury duty.  Why?  You want to go.  Why?  Why?  Because I am fucking bored.  I want to do something else. 
[00:27:30]  I've never been to court in my life, and I want to go see what's going on in Nassau County.  Oh, boy.  Some people feel it like that.  There's a jury of your peers right there.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I am not a weirdo.  I hope you get a really shitty case.  Well, that would be sad, because my life would be more vulnerable.  What town are you from?  What town are you from?  I am from...  Conk?  The Conk.  I am in Old Brookville area.  Oh, Old Brookville? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to get boring shit.  Yeah, you'll get boring some fucking accountant.  I watch SVU all the time.  All I've ever wanted to do is get put on a case.  Right.  Because I'm convinced they're all like these intricate rape cases.  Oh, that's amazing.  Yeah.  You know?  Very cool.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, I can't believe that not everyone's a weirdo that wants to go to jury duty.  I understand there's a few of you out there, but in general, we want to get out  of jury duty.  I think that's pretty obvious, so.  I did so well when I went to jury duty, because I go in the building, and I go right to one 
[00:28:30]  of the officers, and I go, excuse me, officer, I need to voucher my weapon.  And the guy was like, oh, yeah, sure, come this way.  Takes me in the back there by the little safe, and starts talking to me about it.  And I'm like, yeah, what?  And he goes, yeah, what do you got there?  And I said, yeah, I have a talk show host.  You know, it's controversial.  People want to kill me.  So, you know, that's what I've had before.  And he's like, oh, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, man, come here.  This way.  This way.  Hold on.  Stay right here. 
[00:29:00]  Stay right here.  Sign this.  All right.  Take off.  Shit.  How do I do that?  You got to get a gun.  Can we get a t-shirt?  I'm going to get a t-shirt made.  I am Opie.  I walked in there.  Oh, fuck.  How do I casually mention who I am?  Yeah, that's what you got to do.  You don't want to sound like an asshole.  No.  There's got to be a way.  You do it in question form.  It won't matter, will it, that I'm the co-host of a really prunchy show. 
[00:29:30]  That's good.  They've heard it all.  That's what, you got to go in there knowing they have heard it all.  That's why you got to figure out a brand new talk show host.  And you're being honest.  You're not lying.  Yeah.  When you're filling out the paperwork, ask, do you want my on-air name or my real name?  Perfect.  What do you mean?  It's good.  I go by Opie on the radio, Opie and Anthony show, I don't know, but do you want me to just  put my regular name?  That's perfect.  My goal is to be at the ocean by noon today. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  Why don't you put that on?  I'm going to carry on.  Put that under comments.  Right.  When we speed this along, I got some waves to catch.  I'm seeing some hashtags here.  Justice for Opie.  Justice for Opie.  Thank you.  Thank you.  At the beach.  Thank you.  Please.  Yes.  Here's Jay-Z at Yankee Stadium this weekend.  Let's dance and stop.  Let's dance for a while.  Everybody put a show for the right arm. 
[00:30:30]  Heaven can wait.  We're only watching the sky.  Let's fight the scars for Trayvon and Marty tonight in here.  Hoping something done.  Let's start expecting the words.  Yeah, whatever.  Was that his concert?  Yeah.  That was...  There's a little shout out to the guy that punched another man in the face and beat his  head against the ground until the man felt compelled to shoot him to save his life.  Wow.  That's great.  Well, did you hear what Charles Barkley said?  I did hear what Charles Barkley said. 
[00:31:00]  Bravo to Charles Barkley.  Charles Barkley is a very intelligent man.  He really is.  And he never cares what his comments are going to stir up.  No.  He doesn't give a fuck.  I love that.  He's unfiltered.  He's one of the rare exceptions out there in the media.  And he...  I think his comments here were perfect as far as the case goes.  I really do.  Yeah, it was good.  Any thoughts on the George Zimmerman verdict?  Well, I agree with the verdict.  Yeah.  I feel sorry that young kid got killed.  But they didn't have enough evidence to charge him. 
[00:31:30]  Something clearly went wrong that night.  Clearly something went wrong.  And I feel bad for anybody who loses a kid.  But if you looked at the case and you don't make it, there was some racial profiling, no  question about it.  But something happened to change the dynamic of that night.  And I know that's probably not a popular opinion among most people.  But just looking at the evidence, I agree with the verdict. 
[00:32:00]  I just feel bad because I don't like when race gets out in the media.  Because I don't think the media has a pure heart, as I call it.  There are very few people who have a pure heart when it comes to race.  Racism is wrong in any shape, form.  There are a lot of black people who are racist, too.  I think sometimes when people talk about race, they act like only white people are racist.  There are a lot of black people who are racist.  And I don't like when it gets out there in the media, because I don't think the media  has clean hands.  I think you're right.  I'm glad you made that part.  I don't think the media has clean hands.  And like I said, I feel sorry that young kid got killed. 
[00:32:30]  But just judging by the evidence, I don't think that guy should have went to jail for  the rest of his life.  But something happened bad that night, obviously.  Yeah.  I like what one of the jurors said.  They said they both should have walked away.  Yes.  And if there's a shadow of a doubt, there's a shadow of a doubt.  And I'm going to say, Mr. Zimmerman was wrong to, he was racial profiling.  But I think Trayvon Martin, God rest his soul, I think he did flip the switch and start beating  the hell out of Mr. Zimmerman.  But it was just a bad situation. 
[00:33:00]  And like I said, the main thing I feel bad for, it gives every white person and black person  who's racist a platform to vent their ignorance.  Right.  You know, that's the thing that bothered me the most.  Because I watch the trial closely, and I watch all these people on television talking about  it.  A lot of these people have a hidden agenda.  You know, they want to have their racist views, whether they're white or black.  The bias comes out.  The bias, it definitely comes out.  It was a bad situation.  We all lost.  And I feel bad for his parents, because you don't ever want to see anybody lose a kid. 
[00:33:30]  Damn, Charles Barclay.  Nice.  That's good.  And it was racial profiling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is what it is.  Some common sense right there.  Yeah.  Some good common sense.  Yeah.  That was very well said.  And then you got Jesse Jackson.  He just wants to, what, cut Florida out of the U.S. map?  Apparently.  At this point.  He thinks that Florida is an apartheid state.  Oh, fuck.  And he wants to boycott everything from, you know, Disney to oranges. 
[00:34:00]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's not support Florida.  Good luck trying to live without an orange.  Right?  They're delicious.  Oh, man.  So good for you, too.  Are they the best?  Let me see.  We caught an awful fruit, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I like a good orange.  Boy, did I have a peach the other day that was...  Mackinac peaches, Gary!  The Mackinac peaches!  It was so goddamn good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get the expensive oranges now.  Oh, do you?  Look at you.  The ones growing up, you know, they were the dull, the dull yellow ones with the extremely 
[00:34:30]  thin skin.  Oh, no!  Remember those where it was just filled with pits?  Those are the worst oranges ever.  Yeah.  I like the ones where after you peel it, it's half the size it was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The skin is so thick.  Because that orange understands the goodness inside, so it's just trying to protect it.  It's just trying to protect the goodness.  The goodness.  You could drop it from 10, 12 feet, and there's so much protecting the goodness. 
[00:35:00]  Yes.  Not those little fucking rolling paper-thin skin that you're peeling off of it.  That's what I had.  Oh, those are terrible.  What are the mealy oranges?  The fucking awful mealy oranges that have no juice?  It's like they're just juice.  They should be called juiceless oranges.  Yes.  Those are the ones that dry out.  Nothing worse than an orange where you think it's going to be good and then it's dried out  and you still try to eat it anyway because you're convinced you can maybe get the moisture  back somehow with your own saliva.  Terrible.  Horrible. 
[00:35:30]  Can we talk about apples for a second?  Ah, yes.  The apple.  You're bumping an apple and the whole thing bruises instantly.  What the fuck is that about?  I know.  Apples are hit or miss.  Or you drop it and that apple that was...  What are you, juggling?  Yeah.  Badly you treat your apples.  You're an apple abuser.  But then it just gets mushy right away just because you drop it and then it doesn't taste  good because it's now mushy, even though it was a perfect apple a mere couple seconds ago.  Yeah, you're making applesauce under that skin. 
[00:36:00]  It's all stupid and terrible.  By the way, what you just said about the apples, that sounds like what somebody says in a mental  institution.  Like when the doctor gets them off this, like they're talking about why did you commit the  murders?  Now you bit the people on their fingers.  I did.  But why do apples always...  It's like some side conversation with a psychopath.  You think it's mushy when you drop them.  Like that serial killer who would go ballistic when he found that gunk under the soap.  Remember that guy?  Like if the soap collected...  You know when a soap is in a little bit of water, it gets that mushy under soap thing? 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  That drove him crazy.  And he thought that that meant something bad and he would go out and murder somebody.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's nice.  Thanks for that.  Yeah.  Thought.  But here's Jesse Jackson.  He wants to take, I guess, a knife to the U.S. map and just cut Florida away.  See if he can understand that.  What will you do if the Department of Justice decides not to file federal charges against  George Zimmerman as you and others, the NAACP and others, have called on the Justice Department  to do?  What would you do then? 
[00:37:00]  Would there be some action by Rainbow Push?  Well, we think that the Department of Justice does have an action that it should pursue.  A, I think there'll be a civil suit filed.  That is another action.  No doubt the request to the inclination to boycott Florida, to stop conventions, to isolate  Florida as a kind of apartheid state, given this whole stand-your-ground laws.  Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence.  Now, more homicides and more guns make us less secure.  And so that will be all, and I hope all the acts will remain disciplined, dignified, and 
[00:37:30]  non-violent.  Because if they ever become violent, they shift the sympathy from one who deserves it to  someone who does not.  He's out of his mind.  He just comes up with these false stats.  Just as many blacks as whites have used a stand-your-ground law.  Have they?  Yeah, it's just, and it's so stupid, oh, repeal stand-your-ground laws, it'll help, it's not  going to do anything.  Most of the people that are killed have nothing to do with stand-your-ground laws, it's fucking 
[00:38:00]  gang violence.  Yeah, there's some good gang violence and random shootings in Chicago again.  In New York, right?  Some little kid fucking, yeah.  Yeah.  New York had a share.  Six-year-old girl gets fucking shot and killed in Chicago, and, you know, there's no hashtag  there.  No hashtag.  Yeah.  How'd she get killed?  Bullet.  She was at some fucking, she might not be dead, she might be the wounded, she got shot 
[00:38:30]  in the back.  But they were at a memorial for someone else that was shot.  Jesus.  And somebody just comes up and starts fucking firing shots off, hits some woman, hits a  kid.  It's, there's just no, no thought going on there of consequence and other people's life.  And it's just no, absolutely no compassion or fucking, it's animalistic.  Why can't they get a, you know, grasp on the situation in Chicago?  What, what is the main problem there? 
[00:39:00]  Because the, the people in charge are very liberal and, uh, they have an agenda and they  don't want to, they don't want to alienate their constituency that has to vote for them.  And any type of crime fighting and any type of, uh, time they go after, uh, gangs and,  and, and, uh, the African-American community, as they say, uh, people get mad for some reason.  I don't know what it is.  I have no idea why they get mad when, like the, the, the stop and frisk thing is very big 
[00:39:30]  issue here in New York.  Like people don't want it, but the fact of the matter is it's saving lives.  New York for the, as big a city as it is, doesn't really have the, the murder and, and  shooting problem that a lot of other big cities have.  NYPD kind of really has figured out how to, how to work this to the best they can.  And one of these things is stop and frisk.  It just gets illegal guns off of the street.  But isn't it? 
[00:40:00]  And I agree with you.  I think stop and frisk is good.  And I like, I actually, it actually makes me like, Bluerg is taking some weird stances.  Like just when I think I haven't figured out, like, ah, he's this, he'll do something that  I totally agree with.  And like, even though the soda shit annoys me, it's like, ah, there's kind of a war on  fat people and obesity and he's had enough.  Take the steps.  You fuck.  Like there's something about that.  I like, but technically, and this is what I don't like about Anthony Wiener.  They want to stop, stop and frisk.  Isn't it technically unconstitutional?  Yeah.  I think they found a little loophole.  Like they do in every fucking right that we have. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  I mean, the second, anytime someone goes, isn't it unconstitutional?  Doesn't that infringe on our rights to this?  Just seeing what they've done with the second amendment over the years, why is any other  right so fucking holy and protected?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  In this country.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Like, doesn't that mean like all these, uh, like every, the right sometimes common sense  dictates, eh.  They could regulate it.  There's gotta be a workaround for this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, the truth of the matter is, uh, they've gotten a lot of guns off the 
[00:41:00]  street.  That's, that's how it is.  And they, they profile when they do it, but.  What's the criteria?  Do they say they have to say what the criteria is?  I don't know what it is.  Oh, they don't say that.  There's some kind of probable cause I would think because the illegal search, but you know,  I guess they're like, eh, you know what?  You're milling around.  You look like you're loitering.  So let's play the Obama clubs, man.  Oh, bomoo.  So you're not a big Obama guy.  I mean, what'd you think in general? 
[00:41:30]  Uh, I, I.  Did you give him a little?  I thought he overstepped in some areas and I thought he, uh, was concise in others.  I thought he glazed over others.  I like the fact that he did not just go one side and did address the, the fact that there's  a problem in the black community with, uh, violence and crime and, and, and why people  will be profiled.  Um, he doesn't blame the white man a hundred percent.  You know, he says there is a problem with that and people do kind of think about those 
[00:42:00]  things when they, when they look, there was a video I popped up on, on Twitter of, uh,  I guess some vestibule at a Chinese restaurant and there was an ATM in there and there were  like four black guys in the vestibule and guy comes up to the door and just starts shooting  through the door and they're trying to hold the door shut and he's putting the gun through  the door and, and turn his wrist and shooting at the people inside this vestibule.  Was it a metal door or a glass door?  It was a glass door.  Because you shot through it.  He did.  He did.  And these guys are like trying to hold the door shut but he's shooting through it. 
[00:42:30]  Pretty twisted.  And, uh, is that it?  Is that the video?  Might be.  No.  That's different.  Oh, it's the crime.  How it's shooting.  So, so I was thinking like, all right, and they show that before the shooting, there's  an ATM.  It's in the front of a Chinese restaurant, little vestibule and all four black guys have  their hoodies up and they're just sitting in there and the place is a disaster.  There's a beer bottle up in there.  Now, if you're this, one of these white guys that say they never profile and profiling is  evil and bad.  Would you go into that vestibule, take out your fucking debit card and put it in that machine 
[00:43:00]  and take money out?  Right.  Or would you look and say, based on just the fact that there are four black men with  hoodies on, would I find another ATM?  And god damn it, you'd be dumb if you didn't.  And that, by the way, is profiling.  There.  You've profiled.  And anyone that says they wouldn't is a lying sack of shit. 
[00:43:30]  But, and it's also, if you see four cute Asian girls standing in that vestibule laughing  and you say to yourself, I'm going to go in there and use my card, you've also profiled  just in another direction and nobody would ever kill you for that.  Oh, there's the video.  They put some music to it.  I don't know.  There it is.  But you didn't get the beginning there.  Oh my god.  Sam always misses the beginning.  Sam does.  There we go. 
[00:44:00]  Jesus.  They're trying to hold the door shut.  This guy's shooting through the door.  And then he tries to get in and wraps the gun around.  Holy fuck.  Who the fuck is he shooting at?  Anyone.  For what reason?  I don't know.  They're looking for him, though.  And look, all of them got their hoodies up.  Hoodies up, y'all.  And they're like, let's get the fuck out of here.  Six guys.  Anyone shot? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Non-life-threatening.  So I guess someone got it in the foot.  And then they show the video from outside.  Here's the guy.  Walks up.  Gray hoodie.  Just fucking fires through the door.  Now he's trying to get in.  Oh boy.  If he got through that door, though, I think he'd have done a lot more damage than he did.  Why did he get shoot through the glass?  He did.  I guess.  Is it bulletproof?  It might have been thick enough to. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, strengthened glass?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just firing away.  Holy fuck.  And then Ron's.  What part of Philly was this?  Crazy.  Black male, 6'2", medium build, bearded goatee.  We thought, wow.  A Nike.  Dark colored hooded sweatshirt.  We're wearing baseball gloves.  Smart.  Yeah.  Crazy.  What part of Philly?  Philly.  Oh my god damn it.  Goddamn Philly.  That's probably Keith Robinson's old front porch.  I think Keith is from a bad area in Philly.  I don't know Philly's bad areas.  I've never been to one.  I think Keith's from West Philly. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Is it rough there?  Oof.  Oof.  West Philly is a little rough.  Dude, I've never seen.  Oh, when I was in L.A., I went out there and it was when the riots were.  The recent, not bad riots, these recent protests.  I have footage of a protest right in front of my fucking hotel.  They were out there chanting for Trayvon Martin.  So from the airport, I was going to do this podcast.  David Cho, the artist, has a very good podcast.  So the only time for me to do it was to go right from the airport to his place. 
[00:46:00]  So I'm talking to the guy who picks me up about the problems.  And I'm like, we'll go down there.  But it's downtown L.A.  And that's where some of the issues might have.  So he goes, oh, you'll be okay.  And we're riding.  And I look up and I see, I'm like, where are we?  He goes, oh, we're on Crenshaw Boulevard.  Crenshaw!  I'm like, you're taking me right through the worst part of...  Old Reginald Denny Avenue.  And it wasn't like so terrible that we went through Crenshaw.  It was just the timing of it and the fact that there had been a couple of protests the day before. 
[00:46:30]  Sure.  And it was like, what do you hope?  He goes, ah, nothing will happen.  I'll go, nobody ever gets attacked.  I get so annoyed at this guy.  Only because of his fucking cavalier, I'm a white guy, nothing can happen to me attitude.  It's like, what do you think?  We're immune in this car?  Like, he slows down behind another...  Like, he gets behind a car at the light.  I'm like, just leave some space in case something happens.  And I wasn't even nervous.  I was just annoyed that he was so completely clueless as to what could happen to us.  Could you imagine poor Jimmy's, like, the thought going through your head while you're being dragged out of a vehicle? 
[00:47:00]  In the end, he was right, though.  Nothing happened.  Yeah, absolutely.  And most times, I told him this would have been a fun ride because I've never been on Crenshaw Boulevard.  And then we took another way downtown.  And you could just tell this is a part of L.A. I've never seen.  It was like South Central Los Angeles.  And it was interesting to ride through.  Yeah.  But the timing of it annoyed me.  And the fact that he just did it while talking about this bugged me.  Because it was something, like, I like to go exploring in this. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Like, he wanted to just drive down those streets.  Not with me.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Is that that Chinese restaurant that the shooting was?  He got it on the old Google.  The old Google.  That looks like a nice neighborhood.  But it was a vestibule in the Chinese restaurant.  Like, did you have to walk through that to get to the restaurant?  I don't know.  It was probably just one of those.  Just the entranceway.  Counter-Service Chinese restaurants.  Yeah.  This isn't...  So where was this?  Yeah, it's 6600 North 18th Street in Philly.  North 18th Street. 
[00:48:00]  North 18th Street.  So...  The 6600 block of...  It's not exactly Restaurant Row.  No!  It doesn't look very...  So that wasn't really West Philly.  No.  North of the city is a little rough, too, though, so...  Okay.  Yeah, wherever that is.  It doesn't look good.  No.  It's opposed to good.  Oh, we got food in front of us, so we'll play the Obama stuff after the break.  Yeah, sure.  Get into some other things as well.  Yes, indeed.  Bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will return in a moment. 
[00:48:30]  After all, millions have to piss, too.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Happy birthday, Don Henley. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Don Henley.  66.  Really?  The big one today is Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  90.  But his arm is only 87.  Poor Bob Dole.  And for the old-timers, we lost Helen Thomas.  Yes.  She's the broad that used to wear the white, the red dress, and ask the first question.  Yeah, she's a, you know, the White House press press press, yeah.  Another one crucified for answering a question, honestly.  Yep.  Oh, fuck, that was a couple years ago. 
[00:49:30]  Yep.  She'd answered that question about Israel, and they, again, maybe her opinion wasn't what  I would have said, but they asked her, she answered, and then she was penalized for it.  You get penalized for being honest in this country now.  Mm-hmm.  So fucking stupid.  She was 92.  Yeah, ask the question, get in trouble.  Right.  Because you answered it honestly.  How long ago did they finally say, all right, enough with the lady with the red dress asking  the first question?  Mm.  I don't know.  They don't know when that stopped.  I'm going to guess it was Bush.  You want to say Bush? 
[00:50:00]  No, because she was very, very left-wing, and she gave all of them a hard time, but I  think a bit of a harder time to the conservative guys like Bush.  Yes.  Everyone else had to sit there, you know, okay, we've got to wait for the old broad in the  red dress to ask her a question.  Yeah, Mr. President.  That was a picture of her with fucking JFK.  Wow.  That's crazy.  It's been around a while.  Yeah.  Ten presidents, she questioned.  Really?  Damn.  We got all our TVs are all focused on Kate Middleton. 
[00:50:30]  She's officially in labor, and for some reason, our country's giving a fuck.  God, I hope she has a dud.  A dud.  I don't mean a dud like a dud, by the way.  Just a fuddy-duddy.  Just a mediocre baby.  Just a fuddy-duddy.  That's almost ugly.  For the babies on the spectrum of ugly.  Just a dud.  Well, her husband's a dud.  We know that much. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, he's not the fun one.  No, the fun one isn't even related to the royal family.  No.  Well, I guess technically.  Two lady died, but...  Yeah, but...  There's no royal blood of that second son.  No, he doesn't.  There's no fucking way.  Doesn't look like him.  Doesn't fucking act like him.  No, he's not a dud like his brother and his father.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Meh.  He's like a rock and roll fucking star, man.  You can just picture the royals there just being the lousiest fucks.  Oh. 
[00:51:30]  Jesus.  Are you impregnated?  Meh.  Oh, dear.  Meh.  You see how he waves?  Did you see that wave?  Yeah.  That was a little fucking fruity.  Like this.  Oh, my God.  So, I guess we're just waiting for this.  Oh, he's got dad's comb over.  Jesus Christ.  Poor bastard.  Why can't he get the follicles?  He should have gotten the follicles.  Although, you know, that's pretty young to go that bald.  Right.  I'll tell you why.  I don't think he's got options.  Because he's going to be the fucking king of England. 
[00:52:00]  He should just let his hair be terrible.  I'm the king of England.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  You think he eats ass?  No.  No.  I bet you Philip does.  I bet you Philip eats the queen's ass.  Oh, yeah.  Even once he's laying there with the flu.  He has to.  What's that about?  Yeah.  He has to take a backseat to that.  Oh, yeah.  Hunt.  Yeah.  That twat.  Man.  He was basically saying, you know, she was hoping that Kate Middleton would get this baby  over with because she wanted to go on holiday. 
[00:52:30]  I'm going on holiday.  She wanted to go on holiday from being on holiday.  Yeah.  Because what the fuck does she do?  Nothing.  What does any of them do?  I don't even know.  After, you know, the 1700s, I don't see what the royal family's really doing.  I just puke when America shows respect to the royal family.  It drives me insane.  Did you see that photo?  There's a Twitter account called History and Photos, which is a great Twitter account.  Oh, I love that one, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  But there's one picture from the 60s of, like, the British royal guard, and they're all  standing there.  One of them had fainted during the thing, and just look up fainted, and he's lying face  down while all the other ones stand.  It's some giant ceremony, and this guy's just fucking face-planted.  It's an amazing photo.  Why did they help the guy?  They're fucking douches.  Because they're not allowed to move, even if one of their own faints?  I guess not.  Yeah, maybe we can.  I don't know how you'd Google face-planted British guard.  Yeah, I got to see that. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Why didn't they help the guy?  That's not their job.  They just have to stand there.  But can't someone come out of the crowd?  Yeah, I'm sure someone will come out.  Let's get rid of the guy that looks like he's dead.  I'm sure someone probably came out and helped him, but...  Yeah.  Not in that picture.  Not in that picture, yeah.  That's a great picture.  I've never seen that before.  That's from the 60s, huh?  I think so.  I believe it is.  Wow.  Wouldn't be tolerated today.  Oh, no.  Yeah, history and pictures. 
[00:54:00]  That's pretty good.  There's some great Twitter.  Some great photos in that.  Yeah, I follow that one, too.  What's that?  The Trade Center just doing?  We're in construction.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that's great.  Do you guys like the new building?  I mean, it looks kind of cool, the new one.  It looks like the Willis Tower in Seattle.  In Chicago, excuse me.  Yeah, I think it looks pretty cool.  Yeah.  It is giant.  You can see it from fucking everywhere.  I still want to go to Dubai at the end of August with Jonathan.  Go.  I might go for a few days.  My cousin just came back from there. 
[00:54:30]  Support that savage nation.  That's the problem I have with it.  Her.  Love her.  Did you hear that?  I think it was Dubai, that woman that was raped.  That's why I might not go.  She goes to report that she was raped, and they fucking arrest her for adultery.  Wow, really?  Fucking insane.  It really is.  Backwards country.  Or they're saying she made false statements, too.  So I'm hoping that they caught her fucking.  And I'm hoping there's something behind it, because that's just sickening, if that's what  would happen to this poor girl.  Why is this guy hitting a golf ball from a fucking beam? 
[00:55:00]  Being wacky.  They were fucking.  Imagine trying to do that now.  The insurance problems would have a guy standing on the edge of a beam, like fucking 80 stories  on the earth.  Oh, shit would have a problem?  Swinging a golf club?  Crazy.  Yes.  So we got Obama talking about Trayvon Martin, and then we got the guy from Mississippi talking  about Trayvon Martin.  Which one do you want to play first?  I think we should go Mississippi first.  Go Mississippi?  Yeah.  Where's that guy?  There he is.  This guy, I guess there was a Trayvon support rally in front of a black-owned business. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  And some local politician was there.  And this guy kind of walked off to the side and gave a little monologue into his phone  about the hypocrisy that's going on and how he feels about it.  Yeah, this kind of went viral.  The guy's got a cigar.  Oh, he's great.  He had some good things to say.  You know, I'm out here at the remains of the rally in support for one Trayvon Martin. 
[00:56:00]  The youth who was shot in Florida, here in good old Akron, Mississippi, where all of  the slaves, the buck-dancing, shoe-shining Negroes like this guy behind me, one councilman  at large, Uncle Mike Williams, helped to convene this buffoonery that took place in front of 
[00:56:30]  a black-owned store that half of these niggas don't even support.  I find it kind of comical that all of these Negroes decided to get together on this rally  for one Trayvon Martin down in Florida, never taking into consideration the Trayvon Martins  right here in the west side of Akron.  Over the Christmas holiday, you had eight shootings and six murders of black men killing 
[00:57:00]  other black men.  And none of these shoe-shining, boot-licking, behind-kissing Uncle Tom Negroes decided to  have one rally in their honor.  And you know why that is?  I'm going to tell you why that is.  Because a black life only has a value when that black life is taken by a person who's  non-white, non-black, rather.  As long as it's black-on-black, these Negroes don't do anything.  They sit back and shine shoes, fry chicken, kiss white ass, and buck dance. 
[00:57:30]  But as soon as these monkeys can blame the murder on a white person, oh, here they come.  Oh, here they come.  These shines dust off their dashikis and their protest shines.  And then they come out here in front of a black-owned store that they don't even support, shouting  no justice, no peace.  This is absolutely insane.  And it only demonstrates how dysfunctional this Afro-American Negro really is. 
[00:58:00]  The only reason why I showed up is because I had to see it firsthand.  I've never seen such a conclave of minstrels in my life.  The only other kind of minstrels is going to be a nickel in one side of the group.  This guy rules.  Conclave of minstrels in my life.  By the way, because it's radio, this is a black guy.  Oh, yeah.  I would assume most know that, but just in case you don't, we're listening to a black guy.  Oh, yeah.  This is a black guy that is probably very, very pro-black.  Like, he hates these uncles. 
[00:58:30]  A conclave of minstrels.  Wow.  That could be the greatest phrasing I've heard in 15 years for anything.  He's very eloquent.  What an amazing phrasing that is.  Please hear that again.  A conclave of minstrels.  I'm like, wow.  The only other time you'll see this many Negroes in one spot is if they're giving away free Air Jordan tennis shoes  or baskets of Kentucky fried chicken.  Other than that, these Negroes do what they do.  And on one last note, anytime you've got a movement, 
[00:59:00]  anytime you've got a movement,  and the speakers consist of Ophelia Avery,  the president of the local chapter of the NAACP,  a 90-year-old fossilized hag.  And preachers,  you know that movement is going nowhere.  Because preachers,  as we all know,  have been lining their pockets ever since the slave plantation.  So if this is the people that you're going to have as your leaders,  leading your movement, 
[00:59:30]  then it's no wonder that this shit is going nowhere.  As I said,  like this buck there,  it's a Negro behind me,  one councilman at large,  Michael Uncle Tom Williams,  standing in front of Henry's Ackman,  here in Akron, Mississippi,  a black-owned business,  that I might add,  that the Negroes don't even support.  And you Negroes wonder why I call y'all savages.  He's great, this guy.  It is what it is.  Wow.  That was awesome.  He fucking spelt it out, man. 
[01:00:00]  I wish someone would Twitter me that link.  I'd love to retweet that.  That guy is great.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I've never seen such a conclave of minstrels.  Minstrels.  What a fucking biting,  vicious statement that is.  That's like a fucking cut-your-guts-out fucking school.  Yeah.  I mean,  he was speaking the truth  as he sees it,  that's for sure.  And he's not one of those guys  who's like,  oh, these black troublemakers 
[01:00:30]  are causing trouble for white people.  He's not one of those black guys.  No, you know he's militant.  He is a militant dude.  He had fucking sunglasses  with big initials  on this.  What's that?  Dolce and Gabon.  Yeah, he just looked like  a fucking militant.  Smoking a cigar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for him.  Absolutely.  Not being bamboozled.  Where's my blueberries  and oatmeal?  Oh, shit.  Are those yours?  Yeah, that's mine. 
[01:01:00]  I asked for them  and E-Rock said they were gay.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  Yeah, I like it.  Let's not mention  that there's a new  E-Rock song, by the way.  Comment?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Where's my blueberries?  You heard it?  You lied.  Did you hear it?  Yeah, I heard it.  What'd you think?  I liked it.  I haven't heard it yet.  E-Rock heard it?  Sean F. is back.  How many E-Rock songs 
[01:01:30]  does this make?  I think this was  his 10th song.  It was a big deal.  Wow.  Oh, really?  He's up to 10 songs  about E-Rock?  And he has had  a couple that were like,  you know,  a bit, you know,  mediocre.  They can't all be hits.  Of course not.  You need some B-sides.  But this, I mean,  with Justin Timberlake  on tour,  couldn't have been  more topical.  Great.  Content-wise,  it was there.  Did you hear it, E-Rock?  Comment? 
[01:02:00]  E?  Did you see  at the last  WWE pay-per-view,  there was a giant  E-Rock comment sign?  E-Rock comment sign.  That was pretty cool.  Hey, what happened  to the E-Rock cam?  I don't know.  Camera's broken today.  How is that broken?  Marcelino told me  this morning.  How does that break?  How does it break?  I don't know.  Like, I don't get  this place.  Yeah, it doesn't.  If you leave  something working.  How does something  like that break?  How could it be broken  when you come back?  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  How is it broken? 
[01:02:30]  It's like it's working  and then you leave  and then you come back  and now it's broken.  What could have possibly  went wrong with that?  I don't know.  Jesus.  That's so we could  see E-Rock in there.  So I have no idea  if he's pissed right now.  Pissed is the answer, yeah.  Ah.  Well, why?  Why?  He doesn't like  what Sean F  has carved out for himself?  I don't even know  if he's heard this one yet.  Oh, wow.  What was the last  E-Rock song  that Sean F did  just to bring us  up to speed  before we play  the new one?  To bring us  up to speed? 
[01:03:00]  It's so mean.  The last song.  I don't know.  There's people that are  discovering us  for the first time today.  So Sean F's a guy  that is obsessed  with E-Rock  and writes E-Rock songs.  So it's not that you  want to hear the E-Rock song.  You just want to bring  them up to speed.  It was called  Big Fat Guy.  Was that the one  that was mediocre?  If I remember correctly,  I believe it was,  yeah.  Oh, really?  Well, Nagle O'Reilly  came out  and we all thought 
[01:03:30]  that was, eh.  I think Big Fat Guy  we liked.  That was the comeback song.  Maybe you're right.  Yeah, this,  okay, let's see.  I'm not sure now.  Big Fat Guy?  Yeah, let's see  if it's the comeback song  from Sean F  because there was  a couple duds in there.  Oh, yeah, this is the comeback.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  He's never going to lose a pound.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving. 
[01:04:00]  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving.  Catchy.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  He's never going to lose a pound.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving.  Slobo, you rarely see him moving. 
[01:04:30]  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  He's never going to lose a pound.  So I guess that brings everyone  up to speed.  Now you know what Sean F  is about with the E-Rock song, see?  If we could paint the picture  since you don't have a camera today.  E-Rock is not smiling.  Face planted on his hand.  Uh-huh.  He looks pissed.  He just wants this to be done with.  Yeah, very much.  Could you ask him that at least?  We'll accept a nod.  E-Rock, do you kind of want this  to be just done with?  He's really subtly nodding. 
[01:05:00]  He doesn't even want to talk.  With a glare in his eye.  Yeah.  I think E-Rock should lose the weight  and just shut everybody up.  Oh, man.  He's not shut everybody up.  We've done this before, though.  Yeah.  It makes this hilarious.  He's not even fat.  He's not even.  No.  People come in and they're like,  that's E-Rock?  I'm like, yeah.  Oh, man.  He's not even fat.  Right.  Well.  All right.  So I guess it's time for the new song  from Sean F.  What is he on SoundCloud?  It's Sean-F-1. 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  On SoundCloud.  And what's his Twitter?  I forget.  Mondo.  I want to say Mondo 720 or something like that.  Yeah, I think it's something like that.  Mondo 720 on Twitter, I believe, is Sean F.  And here's his brand new E-Rock song.  It's called Goldfish Back.  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  What song is it based on?  It might be based on Sexy Back.  Oh.  By Justin Timberlake.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Right? 
[01:06:00]  I'm bringing Goldfish back.  Those motherfuckers keep my titties fat.  I know you're jealous of my luscious rack.  I'm just a piggy boy who loves his snacks.  Slabo!  Oh.  I'm overweight.  Uh-huh.  They call me Slabo cause I'm out of shape.  Uh-huh.  I suck at work and always show up late. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  Uh-huh.  I sit around and just eat shit all day.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, sex bagel is fat.  Come here, girl.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  What'll it be?  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Cheddar cheese.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Have some of these.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Check out my flyby arms.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Blame Pepperidge Farms.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Flavored makes me smile.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  And my body vile.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Now get your Goldfish on.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Get your Goldfish on.  Enjoy some Goldfish.  Get your Goldfish on.  Enjoy some Goldfish. 
[01:07:00]  Get your Goldfish on.  Nice.  That's...  Can you take a look, Sam?  I don't want to.  You don't want to look?  See, I don't have the camera today.  Can you just take a look?  It was so much meaner than the other one.  It was really mean.  Just take a look.  See what's going on in there.  He's not happy.  That was a little bit of everything.  There was weight.  There was his work ethic.  Yeah.  You know. 
[01:07:30]  He's leaned over the console.  I predict that that will probably not be the only time that's played.  You like that one?  Yeah, that is good.  That's a catchy.  Goddamn toe tap.  I like the original song, so I knew I liked that.  I just love the passion.  He has so much passion, and he couldn't be more convinced that E-Rock has gained a massive  amount of weight by simply eating huge amounts of goldfish.  Huge amounts of goldfish.  Sean F., if you remember, had goldfish packages custom-made and sent them to the studio with 
[01:08:00]  E-Rock's photo on them.  And who wasn't appreciative of that?  Quite frankly, E-Rock.  Yeah, I wish someone wouldn't fucking put my face on a product.  That would be cool as shit.  He's glaring.  He's glaring.  Glaring.  I like goldfish.  They are tasty little chick bits.  Can you see E-Rock from where you are?  Yeah, I can only see his hand because there's a reflection, but it doesn't appear like there's  a smile next to that hand. 
[01:08:30]  Did you hear the part of the song where he starts talking about the different flavors,  like cheddar cheese?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  That was really good.  Can we play it again later on in the show, maybe?  I would, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got Stevie Knight on Twitter, a regular.  He writes, I love these E-Rock songs so much.  He's so unappreciative of the hard work behind them.  That's the real problem.  Hashtag slobo.  That's true.  Someone's working very hard at this.  Sean F.  Specifically.  Sean F.  Sean F. will move on eventually, Rock. 
[01:09:00]  Just hang in there.  Had you heard that one yet, Eric?  Or no?  Looks like he is declining to comment on it.  I mean, have you heard that?  That's a legit question.  I didn't make the song.  It is.  He shook his head no.  You didn't spend your weekend listening to that in your free time?  Did he have an idea there was a new song?  Did you know there was a new song?  He nodded his head yes.  He knew.  He did not.  He chose not to listen to it in his home.  But he was aware that there was a buzz about the internet that a new E-Rock song had popped 
[01:09:30]  up over the weekend.  Well, people get excited.  It's kind of like, you know, when Pearl Jam announces they got a new song, same thing with  Sean F. and the E-Rock songs.  Right.  There's a buzz.  Right.  The internet's a buzz.  It's like hip-hop.  He just puts out singles.  He just puts songs out.  It's like...  Fuck yeah!  He's on the motherfucker.  You know, it's a Justin Timberlake parody.  Yeah, he did know that.  That's good.  You like that one, Ed?  Oh, yeah.  I do like that. 
[01:10:00]  What happened with the roller coaster?  The woman was too fat.  For real?  And flew out.  No.  They couldn't get the bar down on her right.  Apparently, from a witness that was on the platform, she got in.  Right.  They were clicking down the little safety bars.  Sure.  They went to click hers, and she said something to the guy like, I don't think that clicked.  And he went, no, don't worry about it.  And just sent her off, and they went around a big, sharp turn, and she fucking flew right 
[01:10:30]  out.  Yeah.  They said she asked about it, and it didn't play.  That's terrible.  It was so fucking sad.  Horrible, man.  Because she was with her little kid, and her son was with her, and he's fucking crying,  my mom, we got to go back for my mom.  It's just awful.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, she, uh, they zigged, and she zagged.  She was a little weighty.  She was big, but there's no reason you shouldn't be able to go on a ride without being thrown  off it.  Where did this happen?  Texas.  Six Bikes, Texas.  A roller coaster. 
[01:11:00]  How big is that roller coaster?  It's the biggest one in the world.  What?  That's the biggest roller coaster.  ... member in their community off the Texas Giant roller coaster last night.  Neighbors say Esparza just celebrated her birthday last week.  On his Facebook page, one of her sons posted, quote, please tell me this is a nightmare.  Neighbors described her as a good woman and neighbor, and they were shocked to hear what  happened.  Six Flags Over Texas has continued to investigate exactly what went wrong and how Esparza fell  to her death.  Flying out of a roller coaster.  The Texas Giant ride remains closed.  The park says it will use every resource to figure out what happened, but at this point 
[01:11:30]  will not speculate on a cause.  And the park has just told me that if the state chooses to launch an investigation, the  State Department of Insurance would do so.  Plenty of people still visited the park today.  Folks said they felt safe going back on many of the rides.  And this afternoon, neighbors told us that Rosie Esparza was a good person who they will  miss.  Damn.  Like sad.  When they're high up, she was.  She was, like, so close.  Real shocked.  She was, like, real nice.  Because last time she had seen it was on Thursday night.  Why are they showing the hose? 
[01:12:00]  She was watering her plants.  Oh.  She waters her plants.  This morning, the park released a statement saying, quote, our thoughts and prayers are  with the family.  The investigation into the death of Texas Giant is still ongoing.  We are working closely with authorities to determine the cause of the accident.  The ride will remain closed.  In addition, we have canceled the concert that was scheduled for tonight.  Esparza, neighbors say lived here in South Dallas with her husband, and she does have  several children.  Live in Dallas, Chris Van Horn, NBC5.  Why canceled the concert? 
[01:12:30]  It's sad, but why?  Yeah, right?  What's that?  But she said it didn't click, and he went, it'd be all right.  She knew it didn't click.  How does the lap things go on, though?  Like, you're sitting there, does it go across your entire body, or just the lap?  I don't know.  But wouldn't she have her arms over the top of the bar?  Like, I don't understand why the bar went flying out like that.  Wouldn't you be holding on?  Fucking physics, man.  When you have that much weight built up, that much momentum, and the car turns one  way, you're going to, there's nothing you could do to keep yourself in. 
[01:13:00]  Well, it's hitting, no, this is just a roller coaster.  Well, do we have any footage from the Giants so we can see maybe, like, how it's just somebody.  This is the roller coaster.  Okay, yeah.  Okay, so let's.  The death.  I don't.  I would hate that.  Fuck this.  Oh, man, look how high up they're going.  I hate roller coasters.  But it's just an out.  You love roller coasters.  Yeah, I like roller coasters.  No, I don't.  It's just a lap bar.  Probably just a lap bar.  Oh, the poor kid who's right there.  Oh, man.  Oh, fuck this. 
[01:13:30]  Six likes roller coasters are ridiculous, too.  Whoa, that's like straight down.  No, thank you.  So right there, she's not being thrown out.  No, it's just up and down.  Right there, maybe right there.  Said it was a sharp turn.  A sharp right turn.  They start whipping around turns, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's probably still in.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  It could have been any one of these.  Yeah.  Why do you put your hands up?  I don't know.  The bank's pretty steep.  It's exciting.  It makes it more exciting if you put your hands up. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, this looks so scary right here.  They're getting ready to go over a big hill.  Ah, God.  I can never put my hands up.  I'm always too scared.  Right.  Are you?  Yeah.  You think they designed it where if you put your hands up, your hands are going to get  chopped off?  Definitely.  They should have put fucking saw blades all over this thing.  Oh, man.  That would suck flying out there.  Wow, that's a really big coaster.  Yeah.  How long is this ride?  I would hate this.  I would hate this.  I would be like, just stop.  Ah, through the tunnel. 
[01:14:30]  Another tunnel.  It's a goddamn good roller coaster, though.  Coming out of the tunnel.  I told you I humiliated my ex when we were on that fucking, on the roller coaster simulator,  and I stopped it after exactly two seconds.  Oh, that's right.  I was so humiliated, and so was she.  What?  Couldn't you just close your eyes at that point?  Oh, that's it?  No, because you'd feel it.  Are they going backwards?  This is the front cam view.  Yeah.  Oh, that's just straight down. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  They have one exactly like this at Six Flags Great Adventure here.  Same size?  No, this is the biggest roller coaster.  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, it's probably like two inches bigger, so they can call it the biggest in the world.  Wow.  I would hate that.  I'd get very sick.  I'd be crying.  I told you I went on one in Coney Island, and I screamed and cried through all of it  with my grandmother.  Aw, Jimmy.  And there was a black guy and his son in front of us, and they were just kind of comforting  me the whole time.  Oh, there it is.  The black guy's like, it'll be okay.  Just a lap belt, a lap bar. 
[01:15:30]  That's it.  Yeah, but see, your arms are across it, so I don't know how.  It must have went completely up.  It must have just came completely up away from her.  Yeah, and there's two of them, so that's why her son was there.  There's a little door on each side, so she flew right out of that.  What do these guys say?  Are they not nervous?  I think they're using a GoPro, like an older GoPro with the shitty audio.  It's hard to hear.  That's so high!  It really is.  Very high up.  There's a coaster at Great Adventure, where they took the signs down for some reason, but 
[01:16:00]  when they first came out with it, it would tell you as you were going up, the height that  you were at, and it would be like Great Wall of China, Eiffel Tower, World Trade Center,  Statue of Liberty.  How can it be World Trade Center?  There's no 1,000-foot drops, are there?  I don't know what it was.  How high is that?  That's very high.  Very, very high.  Oh, my God.  Now they go straight down.  Look, they're like, oh.  But they're not even scared.  No, they're having fun, Jimmy.  It's fun.  I wish I loved that.  That looks like fun.  Oh, man.  Look, he got out of his seat. 
[01:16:30]  That's right.  See?  Go back a little bit, Sam.  Just rewind a little bit.  Over that thing, he gets pulled out of his seat, and the lap bar is the only thing holding him  in.  That's exactly what happened.  The only thing holding him in.  The thing probably snapped, and she popped up.  I want to go to Great Adventure with Jim and make videos.  Oh, God.  With Jim right in a row.  That would be great.  Watch right here.  When he goes down, you can see.  Yeah.  Over the first whoop-de-doo, right here.  There you go.  Right there.  That's where she went right out.  I got you.  He'd have flown right the fuck out of there. 
[01:17:00]  Boy, you sure put a lot of trust in the fact that that thing is going to stay down.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I wouldn't.  There's nothing you could do about it.  That's awesome.  You're moving so fast that everybody saw you fly.  You know how fucking fast that...  Yeah.  Their ride must have been spoiled.  Spurled.  Goddamn.  That looks like so much fun if you enjoy that type of shit, if you don't get caught sick.  It would be a real bummer to continue the ride after, you know, the lady flew out.  Do you think people are still going, woo?  Oh, God. 
[01:17:30]  Of course.  Yay.  Woo.  Because it wasn't going to ruin their time.  Right.  I don't know the lady, so I'm going to keep my hands up.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  That poor kid, man.  That really bummed me out.  It was terrible.  Lefty wins the Open.  I know you guys aren't golf fans, but Phil Mickelson with a massive comeback over the weekend  at the British Open.  They don't care.  I know.  I get it.  But it came from nowhere to win the fucking thing.  People didn't really think he had a shot going into the final day.  Had an amazing round. 
[01:18:00]  And Tiger, once again, just fucking panicked in a major.  And that's all I have to say about that.  That's all I have to say about that.  You'd want to go on that with me?  Look at this one.  Sam?  I would love to go on that with you.  Can you videotape me?  Look at this one.  What does it do?  All the rides.  It's like this ridiculous tall ride.  Oh.  And all it is is it goes way up in the sky as high as you could imagine.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's right.  And then you just drop.  In Texas, they have that one with the spinny teacup thing. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  When they whip you outside, it's like fucking 40-something stories in the air.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go back to that, Sam.  They can buzz off.  The roller coaster is actually that?  This green part is the track.  It literally goes straight up.  And then straight down.  It's a 90-degree angle.  And then you get over the top of it.  And then it's 90 degrees straight down?  Are they saying it's 90 degrees straight down?  That's not a roller coaster, though.  That's a different thing.  No, that's what it is.  That's a roller coaster?  Yes! 
[01:19:00]  No!  Oh, no fucking way would I do that.  Have you done it?  No, I wouldn't do that one.  I couldn't imagine being online for that.  No.  Like waiting to go.  It would be like waiting to go to the electric chair.  Yeah.  It's terrifying.  And it's the tallest thing in the park.  Oh, God.  Can we see some footage of it?  Yeah.  Is there a video of it?  Some of that.  We're looking at 90 degrees straight up.  Yes.  Do you think there are people who are just not scared of that?  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, some people, yeah, they just like, they just trust the thing. 
[01:19:30]  I'm a thrill seeker, just not that kind.  God.  Find some video.  It's probably not on their site.  Why wouldn't they have a little video on their site to turn people on to it?  Oh, my God.  That's so fucking scary.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yep.  Okay, let's see.  Make it big, Sam.  You got it.  Yeah, there it is.  Is this the best video in that category, Sam Roberts?  It shoots you forward.  It's got to get you all the way up into the sky. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  You can see they're going straight up.  Yeah, but we're waiting for the next car to go.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  We're in the front seat of this.  Yeah.  Why would you sit in front?  Would you be scared?  Yes.  I'm scared now when I'm in the studio.  Would you immediately regret sitting down?  All right.  They're ready to shoot the...  Right now, the car's not moving.  I enjoy this so far.  Oh, my God.  You'd be sitting there waiting.  Waiting for the fucking...  Oh, my God.  It's like an aircraft carrier launch.  I don't think you're going to go up that straight silo. 
[01:20:30]  Yes, you're going to make so?  No.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Here it goes.  Oh, I would hate that.  It launches like an aircraft carrier.  It's so tall, you can't even see the top of it in the frame.  It's like a grain silo, but very tall.  God, this guy makes a shitty video.  Yeah.  Why are we waiting so long for the launch?  It's the anticipation.  A little edit would be nice.  Oh, here it goes.  I would never go on this.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You got shot out.  He's holding the camera.  Oh, my God.  You're going straight up. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  No.  Yes, you are.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're going straight down into a twist.  Oh, that looks so dangerous.  You're going up and over.  It's so fucking dangerous.  They should stop this.  That's ridiculous.  They should stop this.  That's the whole line.  It makes sense they should stop this.  That was it?  That's it.  That's the entire ride.  Where is that?  That's a great adventure.  Our great adventure?  Yeah, we could all go.  No, we're not going, Sam. 
[01:21:30]  I'll go on it if you guys go on it.  I get nervous when people go, oh, yeah, we're going to a great adventure.  I'm like, ah, I don't even want to go.  That's because of the black people.  Well, that's an adventure.  It's a great adventure ride.  Before you even get on a ride.  The scariest rides ever are a great adventure.  Dude, that's crazy.  Travis, you've done that.  Yeah.  What?  You've done that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you're a pussy.  No, not when it comes to roller coasters.  Roller coasters are the best, right?  Yeah.  Wait, you love roller coasters?  This is the greatest roller coaster I've ever been.  No.  No.  What happens? 
[01:22:00]  You go straight up.  Yeah, it's great.  And you corkscrew.  Yeah, you sit in the front.  No.  Yeah.  And when you get all the way up to the top, you can't see anything.  And then right before you go down.  Yeah.  Look, Jim.  Right before you go down.  Yeah, first of all, that shoots you out.  It's like 60 miles an hour right away.  How high are you?  That's very high.  Oh, my God.  Look at the fucking clock.  It looks like you're crashing.  You just see the clouds.  Yeah, and then you go over that hill to kind of slow you down, and then it's over. 
[01:22:30]  First of all, doesn't that twist make it less scary?  No, because when you're about to go down, you're inverted.  Like, it looks like, you know.  It feels like you're, yeah.  Yeah, like there's nothing there.  Oh, my God.  And then you don't go down at like an incline.  You go down like, how do I explain it?  Like behind you, you know?  It feels like, yeah, like you're actually tucking underneath, and you're headed.  It's amazing.  It's the best rollercoaster ever.  How long is that ride?  20 seconds? 
[01:23:00]  But what do you mean by it's the best?  Do you enjoy it, or do you enjoy being scared shitless?  Are you scared shitless?  I enjoy it because, first of all, you're just sitting there, and you don't know when you're going to go.  Like, you're just sitting there, and you're sitting there, and all of a sudden, you're off.  And it's 60 miles an hour right away, and you just fly up this thing.  There's a problem with the ride.  You have no time to be scared because it's just.  Well, people are saying that the ride doesn't work every time.  No, it doesn't.  Sometimes you go back down. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, you know this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's so many people calling, though, and sometimes it doesn't work, and they don't get enough speed.  And now you fall back down backwards.  Well, you need a lot of speed because it shoots you straight up.  But why don't they have it figured out where it works every time?  I think that's part of the fun.  How is that fun?  Because then you get to go.  It's almost like you're riding the ride twice.  Then they boost you again.  Wait, they redo it?  I would say end the ride.  I'm going home.  Wait a minute.  I've got to talk to one of these people.  It's a thrill ride.  Rick and Jersey, go ahead.  Yeah, the best part about that ride is, number one, the slingshot is 0 to 120 in about three seconds. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  And then as you're on the track and it's too late, there's a sign that says,  sometimes this ride doesn't make it over the top.  Not to worry.  You'll come back down and then they send you again.  So you get over that crest and you're hanging in the air and you can start going backwards and you've got to go again.  It's so good.  I would fucking hate that more than I can express on the radio.  I hate that.  It goes 128 miles per hour. 
[01:24:30]  That's like getting a double ride.  This lady went yesterday.  Thank you, Rick.  Carla in the Bronx, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Carla.  Yeah, I did it yesterday.  This was amazing.  You literally feel like you're being launched.  You can feel the air come out of your lungs.  It's amazing.  And you can't even open your eyes.  It's that fast.  And it's the weirdest feeling in the world.  And then we got on Nitro.  You go so high.  We could see the mist coming off the trees in the park. 
[01:25:00]  Nitro is a shit.  Yeah, Nitro is awesome.  That's the one that they used to tell you how high you were as you went up.  Yeah.  Nitro is my favorite roller coaster of all time.  Wow.  How high is it?  People were freaking out, man.  They were like, I don't think I can do this.  And it's like, you can do it.  You're not going to fall out of it, but it's just the most amazing thing.  The thing about Nitro is it doesn't have like a clip thing on you.  Right.  Like, it's just got a built-in thing that goes in between your legs.  Is Nitro the one with like the seven loops? 
[01:25:30]  Or seven hills?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got the hills.  Weird parabola hills where you literally feel yourself come out of the seat.  Yeah, that's the only ride that's ever made me like kind of sick afterwards.  Wow.  Because it's so many hills.  Let's see.  Look at this.  This is how the ride starts.  And this is where the signs used to be.  They took the signs off?  Yeah, they took them off.  Why?  I don't know.  I remember that.  Because it was probably a lie.  No, they weren't lies.  You just see the sky.  You're now as high as the moon.  And it's a slow incline. 
[01:26:00]  It's so slow.  All you're doing is thinking like, oh my God.  This is terrible.  Oh, I shouldn't be doing this.  And you see people disappearing into the distance.  Like they get smaller and smaller and smaller.  And then they have a wooden one called El Toro.  El Toro is ridiculous.  God, no.  I don't like these guys.  I don't like these.  How many roller coasters has it got now?  They've got a lot.  And El Toro is like pretty much the same thing as the big Texas ride.  Right.  Like that is the same ride.  That's El Toro except in New York.  You stopped us.  Why'd you stop?  We were going up.  Yeah, and it rained while we were in the park. 
[01:26:30]  So a lot of people left.  So we just kept getting on El Toro over and over.  Good for you, Carla.  Why'd you do that?  Look at this.  Look at this.  You ready?  Wait, wait.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're at the top of this nitro thing.  Oh my God.  There's no big deal.  What?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's a very big roller coaster.  Holy shit.  It was sick.  And you can't even scream.  The air just comes out of you.  Yes, I could.  Do you scream on roller coasters, Sam?  Oh my God.  Look how windy, turny it is.  I tense my jaw really tight. 
[01:27:00]  I go like this.  Look how tiny the track is.  Yeah, yeah.  Look how tiny and thin the track is.  I don't like the tiny track.  You guys can go on the screen.  Oh my God.  Look at this turn.  Sam and I would be like the big boy rides.  Oh my God.  It's completely sideways.  I have to go on a roller coaster like three times before I'm comfortable enough to scream  on it.  I just never feel like screaming does anything.  And I just wanted to tell Jimmy, happy birthday.  Thank you very much.  Peace, thanks a lot.  Thank you, sir.  You can see.  The phone call.  You see where his hands are going, that he's holding on to like this yellow thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Tight turn right there.  That yellow thing is stationary in the seat. 
[01:27:30]  Nothing clips onto you.  Oh God.  So you feel like there is nothing securing me to this roller coaster.  Oh my God.  You're right.  It's all luck.  Somebody's dead soon.  Well, we lost one over the weekend.  Mars, you know about these roller coasters?  You've been nodding in the background.  Yeah, I love these roller coasters.  You want them?  Absolutely.  All of the ones we just talked about?  Damn, that's a good roller coaster.  In the car, you can't keep your eyes open.  So I wore sunglasses one time, right?  So they got real tight on my head.  And I was shot out.  And I was fine. 
[01:28:00]  I'm walking off.  And then my fucking sunglasses just broke apart.  The impact.  They broke apart.  Jim, what about Superman?  Would you do Superman?  Oh, that's great.  Is that where you fucking fall off a horse?  Probably.  What's Superman?  You're kind of like lying down like you're flying.  Yeah, you're lying down like you're flying.  You start out sitting down and then they move you to a flying.  I think that would be kind of cool.  It's fun.  It's different.  It's not as scary, right?  No, no.  I don't go for any of these.  This is El Toro. 
[01:28:30]  El Toro's great.  El Toro.  I waited like an hour to ride this roller coaster and it was worth it.  This one, go on the back seat.  The very last seat.  Yeah?  Why?  A little whipper out.  Yeah, because you get the whiplash on the wooden roller coaster.  This is like a...  Really?  I can't believe you guys live.  I like the names, too.  There's nothing like, oh, ride the cotton ball.  Yes.  There are all these very scary names.  See, and you can see the big King the Car ride from El Toro.  Oh, yeah.  That's the up and then all the way down.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Are there people that go on both of those back-to-back?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Look at this.  That's all you do there.  You think people just go back and forth?  Yes.  It's one of these that lets you out at first to a little...  See, this would be a fun ride.  A slow turn.  I like this so far.  And then it goes...  This is easy.  Look at how much higher King the Car is.  But this is easy.  I can do this one.  There's just nothing.  Oh, no.  Oh, fuck that.  Oh, man.  This is the fastest wooden roller coaster in the world.  I wouldn't want a fucking wooden roller coaster.  Splinter roller coaster.  Splinter.  What a hunk of shit. 
[01:29:30]  You know what you got to do?  Oh.  Yeah.  Stay home.  I would get so...  I'd just vomit, everybody.  You got to ride the Dragon Coaster at Playland because it's not all that exciting except  it's been there since like 1950.  Oh, great.  So it feels like it could literally break any second.  Some rickety coaster.  And it absolutely could.  Jesus.  No, thank you.  I think so.  I wish I enjoyed this shit, man.  No, I don't think so.  Yeah, I wish I did too.  I'm a dud.  You guys wouldn't go on what different places call it differently, but the last one I went  to in Wildwood was called the Fly Coaster. 
[01:30:00]  And what they do is they strap you in and then they pull you up all the way about 80 feet  and then you have the control of releasing the gadget and they tell you three, two, one,  fly.  Oh, and you swing.  Oh, I've done that.  No, they have that at six legs.  They lift you all the way up.  I've done that.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's kind of...  I would look for the button that says gently get back, lowered, lowered bail.  Yeah, you've got to pull your own cord. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, that's great.  What if you don't pull a cord?  Then everybody laughs at you as they let you come down.  Well, I wouldn't.  What about a...  We've got to take a class trip to Six Flags.  Yeah, you guys enjoy it.  What's that free fall ride?  Oh, this is the Superman ride.  Is it free fall?  Yeah.  That's great.  You bring a penny on there.  Make it bigger.  Make it bigger.  Why a penny?  Okay.  Because you can watch as you fall where gravity stops.  Oh, the penny will, like, levitate off your hand.  Yeah, as you fall.  And then you don't lose the penny?  Well, you do lose the penny, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  That's Jewish.  Well, they owe you a penny, right?  I'll give you a penny.  I don't understand why it's acceptable where the ride doesn't make it to the top of the  hill.  They're like, no, that's normal, and it's just going to fall backwards.  What a great little...  Is that part of it, though, the randomness?  There should be regulations.  No, I think it's truly the physics of it.  Yeah, I think it just doesn't get to the speed that it needs to get to.  It makes it so difficult because it's so tall and steep.  So if you're online with a bunch of fatties around you, there's a good...  Yeah, I'm sure weight and weather has to...  Your ride's going to go backwards?  I get so nervous watching people waiting to get started. 
[01:31:30]  Like, I know what that feels like.  Like, it's so nerve-wracking.  I get very nervous.  I get a stomach ache.  Let me ask you a question.  Are there people that would like when that one ride goes up and goes back, they would  like to go backwards?  I would love to get it like that.  It's extra ride.  No.  Extra ride.  You get an extra ride.  I would like a roller coaster to go like 30 miles an hour at a sensible pace.  Oh my god, they just went...  See, they went up and then they would go backwards again.  Oh my god.  Who wants to go fucking backwards on this thing? 
[01:32:00]  This is another version of Superman.  Disney World has a ride like that where you go and then you go all the way backwards.  Everest.  Yeah, that's a great ride.  Yeah, that's a great ride.  Oh my god.  They had something like this at R6 Flags, which is like a Batman and Robin ride.  Where you would do the ride and then it would stop and you would do the rest of the ride  backwards.  This is making me nervous.  It looks like they're going to fall out and get hurt.  It really does look like they're going to fall out.  Oh, I would never do this.  God, I wish I would enjoy this.  I can't imagine.  I just, I wouldn't. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, that's good.  Here, here you go.  Andy in Boston has a cute little story.  You want this one?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Andy.  It is a cute story.  Hey, you guys remember when you were in Boston?  Do you remember, Darren, about a place called Rocky Point in Warwick, Rhode Island?  Yes, I do.  I never went, but I do remember the name.  Not that it matters.  Yeah, it's closed down now.  It's been closed for years.  But listen, I think they came up with one of the first, or maybe the first, free fall.  So you sit in this seat with like four other people and get barred in and then they elevate 
[01:33:00]  you up and then, you know, the thing just fucking drops you.  So, like two days after this fucking thing, two days after this machine came open to public,  a girl, I think she was like 15 years old, it elevates them up and about 10 seconds before  they drop, she tussles her hair around or something happens where her hair gets caught  in a latch behind her and as the thing drops, it yanks her.  Oh, come on. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I've heard that.  Yeah, she got scalped.  She didn't die, did she?  No, no.  She didn't win.  And it wasn't like unbelievably major.  It was just worse sounding, but yeah, it ripped off the back of her head.  Ripped off the back of her head.  All the hair and the skin.  Holy fuck.  Here's another one with the slow.  Is this snow?  Yeah, well, this is fake snow.  It's Everest in Animal Kingdom.  That looks nice if it goes slow.  Yeah, I like this.  It's going slow.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  And then you look out and you can see like Hollywood studios.  Oh, it looked like you were going to go off the edge. 
[01:34:00]  What happens now?  Backwards.  So I guess you're going to be stuck there forever, right?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Because it would be so much faster to go back.  I don't want to go backwards.  Oh, it looks like the track is broken.  Then it goes really fast backwards.  That's how I would see the entire track.  Oh, man.  It's all dark and stuff.  It's very scary.  Roller coasters are very scary.  I wish I liked it, man.  It would be such a...  Believe me, I see thrills in ways that you guys would find horrifying.  Yeah, that's true.  I just don't move as fast. 
[01:34:30]  I'm a complete fucking roller coaster cuck.  Like any time I've gone to any amusement park with a girl, I have to stand there while  some brave guy gets to sit next to her and goes on.  Oh, you don't go on them?  No.  You don't even go on.  I'll just stand there.  Have fun with another man.  And then you try to talk to her online until she gets beyond...  No, because I can't even stand on the line.  So you go to Disney World, you don't ride the roller coasters?  Well, Disney coasters are fucking... 
[01:35:00]  You just wait in the gift shop?  Disney coasters aren't that scary.  Space Mountain.  Some dude is just scamming on your chick the whole time.  That's a great adventure.  Yeah, I do the same thing with my chick.  It's like they just...  Hey, look, I'm with a coward.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  A roller coaster cuck.  I am a cuck.  And then you fuck her later and she tells you how he threw his arms in the air.  He was so brave.  He didn't even get nervous.  You see that fucking picture that they take right at the end of the ride?  And you go to claim it and the guy's got both hands on her tics. 
[01:35:30]  You're just feeling her up.  So will you go on like Splash Mountain?  Yeah, I'll go to Disney.  I'll do those.  Those aren't that bad.  Riley did Splash Mountain.  So you guys are like on the same...  No, I go on Goofy's fucking airplane one.  Okay.  All right.  She did that one too.  I don't go for teacups.  Any of that.  Go to the one in Texas that raises you up to the top.  And it's those ones that spin you out like octopus tentacles.  Oh, yeah.  I'd love to do that.  I'm glad you would. 
[01:36:00]  Have fun.  I'm glad you would.  It's very high.  I'm glad you would.  Have fun.  I told you.  Me and her had a fucking screaming match when we were in Vegas.  Because I didn't want to go in the outdoor elevator at the Rio.  Oh, come on.  All right.  Why?  Because it's scary.  I don't like heights.  No, you can do that.  And I finally did it just to shut her up.  I'm like, you go.  I'll wait.  You went in the skyboxes in Chicago.  Oh, that's a little freaky.  Yeah, I did do that, but I didn't care for it.  A little creepy.  Can you find where they are?  It's called the Whippoorwill.  Wait, Sam.  Sam's a brave rollercoaster guy, but when we went in the skyboxes, you were scared. 
[01:36:30]  Really scared.  Yeah, he was terrified in the skyboxes.  Let's get that into a box in it.  The vagina thing.  Yeah.  That was so much easier than the rollercoasters.  No, I find the rollercoasters to be much easier.  Than standing in a glass box that you know they designed to never be a problem?  At least the rollercoasters are like some fun.  What is this?  This is Superman, right?  Superman where you're lying down.  Oh, you're lying down.  The track is above you.  This is not a big deal, though.  No.  Oh, it's just you're going upside down, basically? 
[01:37:00]  No, you're hanging.  You're flying.  You're kind of flying.  What about the things in your pockets?  Guess what?  The things.  I love the things Jimmy thinks of.  The things in your pockets.  The things in your pockets.  I hate to tell you, but when you're dropping down fast enough that Mars' sunglasses broke,  I think the things might fall out of your pockets.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  It looks like you're going to hit something.  Oh, my God.  You just shove everything in your back pockets.  That's kind of cool.  That would be fun to be Superman, but not like...  That would be fun if you're upside down.  You're upside down.  Yeah, they're not flying in a straight line.  I would want to go nice and slow. 
[01:37:30]  Nice and slow.  Can we do this 20 miles an hour or I get a good look at the old park?  Jimmy wants to slow rollercoaster.  There's probably millions of people that would enjoy a rollercoaster that goes a little slower.  Just slow.  Oh, my God, yeah.  I'd enjoy that.  Exactly.  I used to like the old...  You should call it the coward.  It's called the Monorail.  The Thunder Mountain Railroad at Disney.  Now, hold on.  It's the wildest ride this side of the Pecos.  And it's like got a little fucking mechanical bunny rabbit next to it.  That one's fucking awesome when you're a kid, though. 
[01:38:00]  That was great.  Yeah, it's a real rollercoaster.  I'm telling you, they should have one for people like me who are scared.  Just call it the Yawner.  Waiting for the Yawner.  The Yawner.  And it goes really slow.  You can just take like the parking lot tram.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  The gondola or whatever ride.  I got scared on that.  Yeah, I got freaked out on the gondola.  Because I was afraid that the gondola, when it goes over...  You know how they have those giant big metal T's that anchor it?  I was afraid that when it went over, it was just going to roll over and fall off.  Oh, it could have.  I'm very frightened. 
[01:38:30]  Just makes Travis laugh.  I hate it.  It's just...  I don't...  Find that Texas thing that goes in a big circle.  You know when it's called.  Just find...  I would just do Great Adventure Texas.  The Disney Monorails.  Please keep clear of the doors.  What the fuck are those called?  What are those dumb monorail?  We can figure it out during the break.  Yeah, let's figure it out.  My whole family's...  My brother and sister and everything are at Disney right now.  I know.  We're at Disney.  Why didn't you go?  I have shit to do.  I got the fucking...  You know, shit to do. 
[01:39:00]  Joe's band is playing at the American Pavilion there at Epcot.  Very cool.  He plays there every year, so...  I love him.  What does he get?  A week?  A week or so down there?  Yeah.  It's like a week.  That's awesome.  He just has to play, like, for a few minutes every couple of hours.  Oh, really?  He doesn't even have a full set?  And then they take care of him for the rest of the day.  That's great.  I would hate this.  Yeah, me...  How long is this set?  I would never do this.  No, dude.  It's not even...  It's like 45 minutes, maybe?  Maybe.  He does, like, five sets a day, and then he can do whatever the hell he wants.  It isn't even that long.  Who does he play with?  Is it the U2 thing?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Holy fuck.  That'd be a great gig.  You wouldn't go on that, Sam?  Look at how high this is.  Really?  This is, like, 40-something stories in the way.  It just feels much less secure.  It feels like you could slip out.  Those are the same chains that are in a park.  Yeah, the chains.  Those are the same chains that are in a fucking park that you go on a swing.  The weak link.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I would never do that.  Yeah, one weak link, and you fucking...  Your thing is dangling.  Just one that's ready to snap.  Oh, man.  I like when you're attached to a track, and that's moving you around.  I don't like...  Like, this is up to gravity and stuff.  I don't like that.  And this swings, and you kind of... 
[01:40:00]  It takes you to the top and swings you out like a flower opening, almost.  Really fast.  That's crazy.  Look at that.  It's definitely scarier than any other one.  I would never do this.  Yeah, because of what Sam said.  Like, I still think I'd do it, but the uncertainty...  It's all gravity.  You're not connected to anything.  How is this guy so comfortable chatting?  He's an asshole.  He's fucking chatting.  He's an asshole, yeah.  I would be scared to go up and then just be lowered, much less without the line.  You wouldn't want to go up so high.  I would look at all those people spinning and get scared for them as I was spinning. 
[01:40:30]  Fuck this shit.  What are they doing?  Fuck this shit.  If I were stuck on this, I would hold on to something tight, shut my eyes really tight,  and just try to wait without freaking out.  Like your first ass fucking...  I don't know.  Just clench.  You wouldn't open your eyes and look?  No, no, no.  I'd be freaking out.  I'd probably have a panic attack.  Would you hold on to anything?  Yeah, I would hold on to whatever was the most stable thing I could find.  They should send you and I up in this same one.  Although you handle it better than I would, because I'm petrified of heights. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, Sam would just be quiet.  Yeah.  Like I'd sit there in tents.  Oh, it's going down there.  Look at that.  Like I try to just ignore it and act like it's just going to go away.  They are mechanical wonders, these things.  It really is amazing that they even work.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They shouldn't work.  Did you see the thing in Coney Island that they had to take apart?  Yeah.  One week?  What?  Because it was swaying back and forth.  Really?  Yeah, what's the...  I forget what it's called.  Yeah, fuck that place.  It is old.  Everything's fucking rickety.  Oh, man. 
[01:41:30]  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  This is new.  Yes.  That's what we were just watching.  Yeah, that's right.  Now I remember.  It's too fucking tall, and it's just swinging.  Wait, it is cool.  It raises you and spins you?  Yeah, as it's spinning.  Oh, I didn't know it went up as you were spinning.  Oh, fuck you.  That's amazing.  Fuck you.  How does that even work?  No.  It's raising ends.  I thought it took you all the way up, spun you, and then dropped you.  I didn't know it raised, spun you.  I would ride that other ride, Kingda Ka.  I would ride that 150 times.  Would you ride it naked?  I would do it naked before I did that.  That's the highest thing in the park. 
[01:42:00]  It's the highest thing in the world.  I think it's one of the highest things.  Look how fast it goes down, too.  Yeah.  Going down wouldn't be bad.  I don't get that nervous going down.  You would never catch me on that.  You should.  I know.  I didn't say I don't question myself after.  I gotta go?  Oh, boy.  Why do I have to go now?  We're having fun, Kenny.  We're having a good time.  Don't be a buzz, Kenny.  I don't have to go.  Do I have to go right at this moment?  Okay.  He's like, oh, I don't care.  Oh, he's mad.  Why is he mad? 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  He's not mad, is he?  No, he's mad.  I'm having fun.  I gotta go to jury duty today in about a half hour.  You say I gotta go now.  Why?  You gotta just make sure you're there by nine.  You'll be sitting there for a while if you want now.  You'll be like, eh.  You want to just get there right before the doors open, but I think you sign in when you  get there, or no?  Don't you sign in?  Let's take a break.  I gotta figure this shit out.  Let's make love.  You bring your phone charger?  We could do more roller coasters after the book.  Yeah, did you bring your phone charger?  Yeah, I got a portable one today.  Bring your iPad. 
[01:43:00]  I forgot everything.  Oh, sweetie.  Bring some blueberries.  All right.  I could do some Sudoku puzzles.  That's easy.  But those only take five minutes.  Hey.  All right.  We'll be back.  We'll return after these messages.  Kenny's telling me I gotta leave to go to jury duty.  It sucks.  I'm having fun, man. 
[01:43:30]  Aw, man.  It's a good show today.  Let's not forget, this is Montreal week.  Yes, we go Wednesday.  We do a couple shows here in New York, and then I guess after Wednesday's show,  we fly to Montreal and we'll be live in Montreal for the Comedy Festival Thursday and Friday.  Nice.  It's more than a conference room, it turns out.  Yeah.  It's a pretty big space.  It's one of those, like, what do they call them in hotels?  A banquet hall?  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  So it'll be good.  And we're going to get, what, 30 to 50 listeners per show in. 
[01:44:00]  Good.  What, we have to tweet out the link or something?  Yeah, are you ready?  I tweeted one out.  I feel like I'm Anthony Cumia and sort out between all of my rants.  You might find the fucking link.  It's in there somewhere?  It's in there somewhere.  All right, fair enough.  And then also we got a, how do we announce this?  We can't announce the comedians?  No.  It's a midnight surprise show.  Okay.  Midnight surprise show at Just for Laughs Montreal, hosted by Opie and Anthony.  It's this Friday at midnight. 
[01:44:30]  Yes.  Suffice to say, some really good names.  Theater of St. Catherine.  Yeah, the Theater of St. Catherine.  It's 18 and over.  And you just go to ha-ha-ha.com.  Why can't we announce the comics?  I don't know, because they may, I'm only guessing that they may have individual shows.  They're probably doing it as a favor to us.  Okay.  And they may have shows that they're promoting up there, so they probably don't want to compete against themselves.  That's my guess.  All right.  Uh, the comics we got for this show, trust me. 
[01:45:00]  Very good.  If you're a fan of comedy, I think you're going to be very, very happy at the surprise midnight show this Friday night.  Oh, Trav Dog.  And I think it's only 20 bucks.  Right.  They do one of these every night.  Okay.  It's called the Midnight Surprise.  You never know what you're going to get.  Oh, okay.  So we're just hosting one of those.  Our lineup is strong.  It's great.  Really strong.  Really great.  And the venue only holds 250 people, so space is limited.  So get on it now.  Ha-ha.  Ha?  Yep.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha. 
[01:45:30]  H-A-H-A-H-A dot com.  It's 20 bucks a ticket or 25 at the door, but I think this will sell out.  Yeah, I don't think there's going to be any tickets at the door.  Very, very cool.  Great comics on this show.  Yep.  So we've got two radio shows, Thursday and Friday, and then the Midnight Surprise show at this St.  Theater St. Catharines.  Theater St. Catharines.  It's on St. Catharines Street.  Very cool.  If you send me the info.  No, I already did.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  I want to tweet it.  I want to be part of the Twitterverse.  The Twitterverse.  Yes.  I want to be part of it. 
[01:46:00]  Tweet away, my friend.  I'm looking forward to going to Montreal this show.  I've always wanted to go up with the show, so it's fun to go up with you guys.  I love Montreal.  Oh, yeah.  I've been there twice.  I loved it.  I've never been.  It's a nice city.  It's a really nice.  You're going to get so annoyed.  Why?  Why is he going to be annoyed?  I've got all the French and everything, and it's worse than it's ever been.  Yeah.  I like old Montreal.  Old Montreal's great.  You've got to go to old Montreal.  I hear tell of a casino trip.  It was a very good casino.  We're going to take a little casino trip.  Where's that?  Wednesday, right when you land? 
[01:46:30]  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  The cop is going with us.  Yeah, it's a good casino.  I'll call you Thursday morning and make sure you're coming to the show.  It'll be great.  Get up there.  Black Jack.  I say that in French, though.  I know, right?  How do you say Black Jack in French?  Uh-huh.  Black Jack.  No, it's Noir Jack.  How do you say Black Jack?  Huh?  I don't know.  How do you say Black in French?  I don't know.  Don't look at me.  It's funny.  I'm in a room full of uncultured zilches, and I'm going to ask you guys how do you say 
[01:47:00]  a French word.  I was just going to say something horrible in a French accent.  Yeah, like Black A or something, right?  Exactly.  All right.  So.  Oh, you got to take off.  We welcome Sheeper Sheeper Son.  They love me a very much.  Like Jerry Lewis.  Can I live tweet from the fucking jury thing?  Yeah.  Ant did that.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Give me some footage.  They did last year.  Yep.  All right.  Oh, it was Kevin Pollack who was in.  Kevin Pollack was in, and I.  Jamie Hector.  And Jamie Hector.  Oh, hi, E-Rock.  Good morning.  Hey, there he is.  How are ya?  Hi, Eric's back.  How are ya?  How are ya?  Oh, God.  I thought you would pipe in when we were talking about roller coasters.  I thought you had to leave.  You have roller coasters, right?  What?  Oh.  I thought you had to leave.  What?  I'm just saying.  I know you like a good roller coaster, too.  Wow face.  Do you like roller coasters?  No.  Oh, you don't?  I thought you did. 
[01:48:00]  No.  Not me.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough, sir.  What's the matter with everybody around here?  I know, right?  Everyone else is in a good mood.  Jiminy Crick.  No, I mean about roller coasters.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  I sent you all the information, Jim.  Thanks, Travis.  It's in a text.  Have fun with dice.  Okay.  Hey, where's Opie?  Oh, he went to jury duty.  Did you jury duty?  I think he'd be talking about something.  Yeah, you hear about that woman on the roller coaster?  Yeah, she.  So, uh, you know, what are you doing? 
[01:48:30]  I, I, can I, can I, you want to stay and I'll go, jury duty?  Yeah, no killing.  I'll go in your stead.  Like Greg Hughes?  Yeah.  You're going to need a nap.  I know.  It's more exhausting when he comes in.  Egg-zau-sting.  I'm not saying he doesn't do good radio, but he's exhausting.  He is exhausting.  That's just it.  Exhausting.  All right.  Have fun, man.  See you, buddy.  Keep us posted.  Remember, guilty as charged.  Yes.  I know your type.  That's what you do. 
[01:49:00]  I know your type.  I know your type.  I know your ilk.  Yeah.  Where are we hanging for this?  Yeah, there you go.  That's going to be my opening line.  Guilty.  Guilty.  Yeah.  Oh, lucky bastard.  Yeah.  Gets to go to jury duty.  I got it next month.  Most people don't mind because it gets them out of work, but when you have this job, it's  like, man, you're just hanging out talking.  It's kind of fun.  I know.  I don't want to go and just not talk.  Yeah.  Just sitting there.  They caught the leader of Los Etas. 
[01:49:30]  Los Etas.  Miguel Trevino.  I'm not sure of his name, but man, he was a...  I had never seen really...  I saw old pictures of him, but you see the new photos of him?  I guess they roughed him up a little bit when they arrested him.  Did they?  They put a few marks on him?  I was watching a couple of...  Oh, my God.  That's like an older photo of him.  Yeah.  Look at the new pictures.  I was looking at some fucking...  Some cartel videos. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I saw some, like, where they fucking murder four women.  They kill women and everything.  Oh, yeah.  And they murder them with fucking machetes and axes.  They just chop them up alive?  Oh, yeah.  They'll swing an axe into the back of their fucking neck.  What the fuck kind of savagery?  They said that this guy who was arrested was known for his grotesque savagery.  That's how they phrased it.  Like, how do you...  Not just savagery.  Dude, this guy didn't play games.  Do you think he sleeps well at night? 
[01:50:30]  Like a baby.  Like a baby.  They would put...  They said he would put his enemies in, like, fucking drums and burn them alive.  Oh, you know how much that would hurt?  Oh, dude.  In a metal drum.  Do you know how that would hurt?  Oh, man.  And then he just fucking cooked.  Yeah.  He would cook.  Yeah.  This guy...  Like a steak.  Yeah, he didn't...  Fuck.  He didn't fuck around at all.  Where's that picture, Josh?  I don't know.  Well, I don't know where you saw it.  What was he...  Put Lozeta's leader captured. 
[01:51:00]  What was his whole deal?  I can get the story, but everybody's got, you know...  It's going to images.  The drug lord?  There he is.  Yeah, that's the photo.  That's the photo.  Wow, he looks...  You see this guy's face.  If you look him up, like, that's just a guy who there's zero negotiating with that.  Yeah.  Could you imagine, like, oh, but I'm sorry.  Maybe we could work this out.  You just get that look.  You don't think he responds to, like, being, like, accidentally bumped on the street?  Oh.  You wouldn't get near him on the street, probably.  Actually, if you accidentally bumped him on the street, he'd probably be a gentleman about it. 
[01:51:30]  It's if you steal his money.  Oh, my God.  If you have a fucking problem.  See, look what they do.  That's not nice.  Holy shit.  They just hung.  How many people are there?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Just nine.  Nine people hung from an overpass.  Just hung.  Where is that?  I don't ever want to go there.  Yeah, it does look like a major.  It's not like in some...  Any one of these crimes, any one of the cartel, like, butchering, 
[01:52:00]  would be front-page news in our country every single day.  And it's commonplace.  It's commonplace there.  So he was a drug lord.  Yeah, he was, uh, it's him, and there's the other guy is, uh, El Chapo, I think he's called.  He's the one that is in hiding.  Charlie Chapo.  And, uh, they said he likes to bribe the officials, whereas this guy killed them.  Yeah, he's now filing for legal protection over claims that he's at risk of torture or isolation during his detention. 
[01:52:30]  He doesn't want to be hurt.  Yeah, well, that's why it's the lawyer move.  Uh, he doesn't want to be shipped to the U.S.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  None of these guys want to come to the U.S.  because their influence is kind of not as strong here in our prisons.  What a creep.  Fucking scary guy.  This guy was badass.  How'd they get him?  I don't know.  It was a helicopter.  He was in a Jeep or a truck with, like, two other guys, and they had, like, $2 million.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and I don't know.  The helicopter forced him to pull over.  It was obviously a military operation.  And, um... 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, they knew who they were.  Oh, yeah.  His brother is the only one still on the loose.  They've gotten...  See, they're like the Jamaican posses were, but they're much more violent.  Mm-hmm.  But they're so ferocious, they force you to do something.  Like, they force the military to act.  Yeah, yeah.  They're so fucking horrible.  Fuck.  Very scary.  He is just a perp walk.  Oh.  I got him doing the perp.  Oh, my God.  That's him, too, right?  Yeah.  But he doesn't look as scary. 
[01:53:30]  That's an older picture of him before.  No.  That's him as a younger man.  He's seen some shit, huh?  Yeah, I was watching a couple of videos I probably shouldn't have watched.  Oh, no.  Because there's one...  Not that you people want to hear this, but this is, again, why I don't fuck around and  go to Mexico.  Oh.  There's one where they...  It's like, I think the Sinaloa cartel is executing Zetas, and they have like four of  them there, or three of them, and they usually just start sawing your head off.  But this one, they take the knife from the back, and they kind of jab it up into the front  of the throat. 
[01:54:00]  And the guy's like, oh!  He's really struggling.  It's a terrible, terrible video.  Why do you watch that?  I fast forward through these now, I can't get through them anymore.  Fast forward?  Why even...  He's got trouble watching these rollercoaster videos, and he's...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really sickening.  I can't watch that, because you put yourself in the situation.  I see no value in watching them.  You watch it and think how horrible that would be to have that happen to you, and you almost  get that weird feeling that you don't want to experience that. 
[01:54:30]  I understand the curiosity in watching them, but I have no...  Have you ever seen one?  No.  It's terrible.  You can tell in the beginning.  The curiosity is there, but when you start the video, and it starts to sit in that this  is real life, and it's really happening, you've got to turn it off immediately.  No, my curiosity in videos, it's a different type of curious.  Curious, George.  When there's a guy...  Whenever there's woods behind you, and there's fucking military men with guns pointed at you, 
[01:55:00]  and you're reading a statement, oh...  Well, it's not going to end with surprise!  The one video I saw, there's all these women, and they're forced to...  They're kneeling, and three of them are topless, and they're forced to say who they worked for,  and who gave them their orders in the cartel, and there's literally nine guys pointing fucking  machine guns at them.  It's so fucking menacing.  I think I would just try to get up and run and hopefully get shot.  Get shot.  Yeah, that's the best you're going to hope for. 
[01:55:30]  The person that sent me here...  Whoa!  Whoa!  Run away.  Look over there!  Although they wouldn't shoot you, they'd probably just torture you slower.  Yeah.  Just do the Goodyear blimp trick.  Oh my gosh, it's a Goodyear blimp!  Whoa.  Okay.  What'd they do to the women?  Um, I think it was for...  Give them a makeover?  Send them home?  In a way, yeah.  In a way, in a way!  In a way.  Let's see what you look like without that head.  Jeez.  It was...  I think that one of them...  Because now they just kind of go crazy, like... 
[01:56:00]  It seemed like one of them was sawing your head off, and one was being butchered with  an axe.  How do they do that?  Why do you watch them?  Do that!  What type of...  It's just...  Fulfillment does they give you?  None.  There's no fulfillment.  It's terrible.  It's very upsetting.  How do you do that as a human being?  Is it like to see if you can?  No.  No.  No, no.  It's the world we live in.  It's what's happening.  It's not just this...  You know, people...  I talk to people going on vacation in Mexico.  Even though they're not really...  They're not beheading Americans, but that's what's happening there. 
[01:56:30]  And people are like, oh, I'm going to Cancun.  I'm like, do you know what's going on there?  Are you fucking stupid?  Like, they put themselves in harm's way by underestimating what's going on.  Aren't those isolated resorts, like, a lot safer?  Yeah.  Until they want to come in.  Because they have killed people at the resorts.  And when the cartel wants to do something, they do it.  They do whatever they want.  They're fucking...  The guy at Breeze's.  The security guy at fucking Sandals.  Dude, the cops there aren't going to do anything.  Yeah, the cops aren't going to do anything.  The cartel shows up.  Look out for the fucking head of security and also the scuba dive instructor at Sandals. 
[01:57:00]  They literally...  I've seen footage of the cartels doing these missions where they're going in and they're  shooting people in apartment complexes.  They're targeting people.  And the cops just stay on the outskirts.  There's literally six truckloads of guys with machine guns.  You can't take your American ideals and think that that happens there.  Oh, they can't do that?  The police are around.  Don't they just generally stay away from Americans?  No, I don't know if they do. 
[01:57:30]  No.  They kill Americans.  They probably won't search them out.  But if they're in the way...  Yeah, I don't know if they search us out because that kind of brings a tremendous...  Like that one DBA guy they killed brought a tremendous amount of heat.  A lot.  Yeah.  So...  But I don't know if they give too much of a fuck, these regular...  They're not...  All the Americans will get upset.  Yeah, well, yeah, but if American tourists are going over there and disappearing...  They have!  They get kidnapped!  Even if they don't kill you, they kidnap you for money.  You have money. 
[01:58:00]  They'll kidnap you and send one of your fingers back and say, yeah, do you want them or not?  I'm sure if you're a lady, you're going to have a fucking vagina full of uncut Mexican  dick, too.  I would go nowhere fucking near it until this problem is done.  Yeah.  Because it's terrible, man.  It is fucking scary.  What about the horrors of Canada that we've got to go into?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of things.  Price...  Price of a dollar.  Don't get on a bus.  They just more talk to you until you doze off.  You've got to...  Oh, yeah, the guy in the bus...  Because he has money called a loon... 
[01:58:30]  Looney?  I mean, he might be at the live show.  He can go wherever he wants.  I would hope so.  Oh, oh, fucking eat the guy on the bus guy?  Yeah, he's allowed to just do whatever he wants during the day.  Amazing.  Because he's mentally ill.  Yeah.  Like, it's amazing that Canada's not stupid with that guy.  They really...  Canada is an idealistic place, but they really are fucking idiots with certain things.  They have some weird logic.  Yeah, that guy cut someone's head off on a bus and started eating him, and they deemed  him, you know, all right, you can go...  Now he's always off his meds, but he's okay now.  Meanwhile, a comedian...  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:59:00]  $15,000.  Oh, yeah, but a comedian says something, and it's a human rights violation.  What a wacky little fucking country.  We're not that far.  They're zany.  Oh, please.  At the rate we're going?  Yeah.  Ugh.  And if you want to go to our live show, which we plugged before, ha-ha-ha.com, it's Friday,  July 26th.  The Opie and Anthony show are hosting the Midnight Surprise show.  We're not allowed to say the comedians, but I know the comics that are on it, and we have  a very, very good lineup of comics. 
[01:59:30]  And this is not the radio show?  No.  No.  I mean, we're hosting it.  The radio show's hosting it.  No, but Sam's just being specific that you're not talking about going to see the radio show.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, this is a midnight show.  Yeah, because people are also talking about going to see the radio show.  The radio show's in the morning, 7 to 11, we're just giving an extra hour, so that  some of the comedians who are going to get on can, no, this is the, we're doing Thursday,  Friday morning, Saturday, Friday night is this show, it's different.  It's a comedy show.  Comedy, it's a stand-up show.  Yeah.  With stand-ups.  And they're very, very fucking good.  It's a really good lineup. 
[02:00:00]  I'm so excited.  I'm surprised we got a couple of them on.  I'm excited to see one person in particular.  Oh.  Okay.  Who I've never seen.  Oh.  On the list that we can't mention.  Yeah.  Who's, you know.  Such a tease, Trav.  Yeah, maybe you can tell me after.  The, the last one we got.  Okay.  Um.  Taking the little lady with you?  Yes.  Oh.  That's the great thing about going to Montreal.  We have lots of people that can watch our daughter.  Ah, is that it?  Sure.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  Not you.  You help out.  Everybody lends a helping hand.  Oh, great.  Everybody pitches in.  Yeah, yeah, me too.  He's very fun.  Yeah, he's great.  Ah.  I'm very looking forward to this.  And we have lots of comedians booked for our radio show.  Do we really?  Yes.  Are they our regulars?  Do we have anybody who's not a regular?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Plenty of regulars and plenty of not regulars.  Yeah, regulars.  Yes.  How do people go about getting into the show?  Uh.  Audience members. 
[02:01:00]  They can email opanthony at SiriusXM.com.  Okay.  Uh.  But space is incredibly limited.  Mm-hmm.  And we may already be full.  So what you're saying is be dialing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no guarantee you're going to get in at this point.  Be dialing.  Because Anthony tweeted it out yesterday.  Yes, I did.  It was up on Facebook on Friday, so a lot of people have already gotten in touch with us.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry, turkeys.  Yeah.  Snooze, you lose, right?  It's great.  It's going to be fun.  I, um, I'd never been to Montreux, so I wasn't even quite sure how far it was. 
[02:01:30]  It's not that far?  It's very close.  Very close.  The plane ride's like an hour.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's a very quick plane ride.  I didn't get, like, movies ready on my iPad and stuff like that.  I was under the assumption it was a little further west than it is.  No.  I was under that assumption.  But that's Toronto.  Yes.  Toronto.  Toronto's the same plane ride, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of like a triangle, you know, if you go from there, there, there.  But, uh, yeah, I was surprised. 
[02:02:00]  I'm like, oh, boy.  I'm surprised there's flights that offer first class.  I, that's what I was getting at.  I'm like, we, we, of course, demand we fly first class.  It seems so unnecessary.  Will you be taking advantage of that?  Yes, I will.  Oh.  Well, first of all, because I love, uh, boarding first.  I love, uh, getting a beverage while everyone else is boarding.  Um, see, I just do that kind of stuff in the waiting area because I'm not allowed to go  on, yeah.  Yeah, I'm strict my water.  Ne, ne, ne, ne.  Or if you sit in the last row of coach, you get on first, too.  Like, after they do first, they book the back of the plane. 
[02:02:30]  Well, yeah, but who wants to be way back there?  I don't even mind.  I've ridden it.  It's, I'll, I'll, I'll take a regular, like, you know, the, the Embraer, Embraer flights  to, the thing, without first class.  Some of them don't have a first class.  They're fine, as long as it's on a prop plane.  This is such a short flight.  First class doesn't mean much at all.  Are you taking first class?  Yeah, but I mean, uh, only because of the airline and where everybody's going and they're  flying me up, I mean.  What kind of equipment do we have?  It's an Embraer, it's a bigger regional jet, which is why I like it.  Some of the jets that go up there are, like, small, but this is a bigger, I think, 
[02:03:00]  Canadian Air regional jet.  Oh, Kenny.  Kenny will know.  Kenny's got all the information.  Is the coach nice, too?  He is the man.  It's not much different, honestly.  Sam, you're a Kirby.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sam's incorrect.  Oh!  Yeah, they don't, they don't board from the back of the plane anymore.  Now they, I don't know who invented this group boarding.  Oh, right.  But they said the group started in the back, though.  I thought the group started in the back.  Yeah, it's not the back.  You've been spending a little too much time in first class, it sounds like.  Well, I, I, first class, but economy plus. 
[02:03:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Economy plus is, is really, has a more leg room.  And I've ridden economy plus before.  It is pretty sweet.  Pretty sweet, right?  Oh, yeah.  Kenny, what, what do we got?  But, uh.  Ah-ha!  Drop something.  Ah-ha!  Papers.  These are, uh, uh, Air Canada's co-chair with United Airlines.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, a lot of these are Air Canada flights.  Like, when you're leaving Wednesday, it's an Air Canada flight on a big Embraer.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Ah-ha!  So, in first class, there's one seat alone.  Yeah.  And then two seats on the other side.  Ah!  And, um.  How do they balance the plane?  Well, in the back, it's two.  E-Rock.  It's two and two.  Oh, look, he shook his head.  He's like, come on, leave me alone.  You going with us, Eric?  Are you going, E-Rock?  Yes.  Sweet.  Nice.  You and Jimmy are sitting together.  Aw.  Aw.  That's fun.  Cool.  Me and Jimmy.  In row two, so get a gas mask.  I know.  A gas mask?  A gas mask? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Thanks, Popeye.  Get yourself a gas mask.  Here's going to be my flight.  We're going to be laughing.  Ah, this is going to be good.  30 minutes into it.  Dude, I know.  He was acquitted.  Relax.  I'll be all hammered.  Flight's not even long enough for you to make all your points.  Repeating things over and over too loud.  Jimmy's like, yeah, oh boy.  It's fun, though.  It's a fun city.  The people are actually pretty nice.  Do they call it fun city?  They do.  With two ends at the end.  Nice. 
[02:05:00]  That's fun.  Fun city.  And I enjoy it up there.  We're staying in a good hotel.  Don't say we.  I won't.  We are staying in a good hotel.  Oh, why?  Are they two different hotels?  Yeah.  I mean, this we thing.  There's two different we's.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is there more of an economical hotel for the staff?  The hotel the staff's in is the festival hotel.  Yeah, I'm happy with that.  I get to go down in an elevator and do the show.  Yeah.  We're happy.  We're happy in the festival hotel. 
[02:05:30]  No problem.  However, there were certain requirements that I guess were not met.  So there will be.  24-hour room service?  There will be a small group at a much fancier hotel.  Well, I'll be honest.  I'll tell you why.  I was willing to stay at the festival hotel last year.  And when I went in there, I was tired and I had to do a late show.  And then I was doing a Bob Saget show the next night.  And I found out when I got there that there was no room service.  There was some kind of a strike.  And I didn't like, I was fucking so irritated.  I'm like, I just, I'm like, well, where is it? 
[02:06:00]  And I called Bob.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on?  And where are you?  And he goes, oh, I'm at this hotel.  So I asked him to move me.  And in fairness, the Hyatt, which is the hotel that the festival's at, the manager of that  hotel put me in another one.  Like, they were so great.  The fucking, the management there was probably the best I've ever dealt with in a hotel.  To accommodate me because of the strike.  They knew it wasn't no one's fault.  It was just a fucking terrible time.  What a diva.  Room service diva.  I have to, though.  I mean, I wanted to eat.  I do, too. 
[02:06:30]  I love me some room service.  I do, too.  Remember when there was mold on the walls?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And I think I still have lung damage for that.  I paid my, here's the thing.  I'm a cunt.  I fucking paid my dues.  I ate shit for fucking, well, that's recent.  I mean, let me rephrase that.  I fucking did terrible hotels and long drive.  I remember one time, I used to sleep on a cot in the fucking, with the middle and the  headliner, and I woke up one day and they were just gone.  Don MacArthur, and I forget the other guy, who they said, ah, you look so peaceful. 
[02:07:00]  They just left me at the gig and I had to drive myself.  I was hours behind them.  We were doing a road trip.  I fucking, I was, I paid my dues in shitty hotels.  Oh, man.  Believe me.  The first fucking, until Dice.  I stayed in terrible hotels until Dice.  I didn't know what a fucking five-star hotel was.  Really?  Yeah, I was expecting him to put me in a shit hotel.  But he put me up with them.  Once you go for those good hotels, it's very hard to go back.  Dude, it's fucking, I know some comics that talk about. 
[02:07:30]  I can't, I won't.  I refuse.  But I'll talk to some people who open for certain comics who I won't name.  And the headliners stay in better hotels than their openers.  Like a lot of times, the openers do not stay with the headliners.  They're like, really?  And they're like, yeah, they drop us off at this one and they go to the fucking five-star  boutique.  And I'm like, I've had that happen where the club is putting up the middle.  But if I'm putting them up, I always put them with me.  Always in the hotel.  Because it's like, it's a nice perk of opening. 
[02:08:00]  And I always, I never forgot Dice for doing that.  Right?  Well, you can mention it to him in about 15 minutes, I think.  Am I right or wrong, Kenny?  Right or wrong?  Jim's absolutely right.  Right.  Yes.  And Jim is very generous on the road with everyone.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's just because people are nice to me.  And it's like, you always remember if somebody treats you good when you're fucking working  with them.  Pool, Kenny?  Pool at the hotel?  He doesn't play.  Oof.  Pool.  Chip?  Yes, you have all your luxury amenities that Canada has to offer. 
[02:08:30]  I will have to remember to bring a suit.  Yeah.  Do we have a pool?  I don't know.  You do, actually.  Oh.  I don't know.  Hey.  You do?  Yeah.  I was kidding.  Well, you could come over to our hotel and hang out.  No, we're good.  We've got to hang out.  Yeah, thanks.  We're fine.  No, they can't, actually.  You have to show ID to get into our hotel.  Yes, it's called a scum filter.  I mean, you know, because we've got to get together and drink some beers or something. 
[02:09:00]  Then come to our hotel.  Yeah, we'll be in our hotel bar.  Yeah, there's a big trough that you can just drink out of.  Do you mind drinking Canadian beer?  I don't mind the Canadian beer.  Canadian beer.  It's a little more alcohol in it.  Yeah, it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  I would drink, like, I remember drinking some Molson ice up there.  And I was like, after two, I'm like, what the fuck?  Yeah, they got some strong beer.  I'm hammered.  The Canadian beer sponsor, I believe, is Selman.  Is that?  Can you watch that up?  Yeah.  I believe it's something like that. 
[02:09:30]  There's very fun hang areas, like, in the bar at the Hyatt, where all the comics go and  hang out.  It's a fun hang.  You see people you haven't seen in a while.  Every comic at the festival goes there and fucking hangs out.  It's a really fun time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, we know so many guys up there.  Colin will be up there.  Fucking Bobby Kelly.  Fucking Judah.  There's so many acts are going to be up at the festival this year.  Yeah.  It's Selman beer.  It's nutritiously good.  It says notoriously good.  I don't have my glasses on. 
[02:10:00]  You know what?  He won't wear his glasses.  You won't?  And at night, it does help you.  Kenny lies.  He goes, oh, it doesn't help me at night.  And meanwhile, we're driving, and he's slowing down, looking at the exit.  It's like fucking driving with Miss Meany.  You gotta wear them.  It's hazardous not to.  It's very dangerous out there on the road.  I guess he still wants to feel young.  I know what it is.  It's psychotic.  He thinks it's a weakness, and once you give in, you won't.  It's like why he saves his horn beeps up.  He's saving the use of glasses. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, but you gotta wear them when we drive.  It's fucking safer.  I had eye surgery.  I mean, we all need eye help.  It is terrible when you finally have to put on the glasses.  Yeah.  I do it at home.  Put them on.  I did it in fifth grade.  I don't do it here.  And as you notice, the copy for the commercials is moving further and further away from me as  I'm trying to read it.  As soon as Sam's just going to hold it up here.  Yeah, over there.  Big cue cards.  Dude, I can't read my phone when I wake up.  I'm at that point now where I'm squinting for a while and I have to hold it away. 
[02:11:00]  And I still have not gone the way of Anthony, who has fucking billboard font.  I went to the biggest fucking text you could possibly put on your phone.  You can read this text from Google Earth.  Yeah.  It's just giant.  It's one word.  How do you jerk off to that?  How do you talk dirty?  You can't see anything anyone says.  And then I'm going to suck your pussy lips.  Your thumbs have got to be ridiculously strong.  Yes.  Crazy.  All the scrolling. 
[02:11:30]  For all you lack in character, you make up for your thumb strength.  How would you jerk off from reading anyway?  It's like...  Oh, dude.  Let me see.  I want pictures.  Let me see how many texts I have to go down before I can find one that I've jerked off to.  Oh, okay.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  First one, Travis Teft.  Oh, nice.  Winner?  Winner.  Second one, third one down, I have.  Three down, and you're already cranking. 
[02:12:00]  Wait.  No, the first one I kind of have, but not in this particular exchange.  Like the second...  You're not a visual stimulation guy?  What?  I would say six out of the first seven.  You're not a visual...  I'm the only one.  Oh, my God, I am.  Yeah, but I like to read when someone says something dirty.  Well, yeah, but I mean...  I'm fucking very visual.  Like, I want a picture or something.  Yeah.  Show me your cunt.  Show me your cunt.  Whatever.  But, you know, yeah. 
[02:12:30]  It's hard to get that.  A lot of times, they just say things.  Yeah.  They just say things.  Well, it's why sexting is so popular with the kids these days.  It's so great, dude.  It's so great.  I was so fucking horny last night.  I was out of my mind.  Really?  I was literally...  I was afraid.  I was so horny.  I just fucking jacked off.  Sitting there.  Going off my new website.  You've jacked off to your own website?  No.  I did such good work.  I was going to say.  It's going live soon.  I'm very happy. 
[02:13:00]  Finally.  And you're happy.  Do you like the way it looks better?  Yeah.  It's nothing crazy.  It's a very simple thing.  You know what I mean?  It's not like a million flash thing.  I think you don't need any of that shit anymore.  And it will look okay on...  It's just basically information.  But it's just finally something where people can go for tour dates, but it's just not up  yet.  People want simple these days.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  It's like years ago, when people were getting their own websites years ago, it was just 
[02:13:30]  the more shit you could pile on it, they thought was the better.  And it just got to the point where people were annoyed by that.  It's so cluttered and loud.  It's just going to say, who are you?  Yeah.  And where can I see you?  And then links to your Twitter and your Facebook.  Yeah.  Because all the other stuff now covers it.  And that's what people want anyway.  Do they even want...  He's got my Twitter scroll on it.  I'm like, get rid of it.  I don't like Twitter scroll.  I said, and then he goes, yeah, but it's kind of like, I might leave it there on the  one page.  I'm changing the font, because I don't like the font.  I think you should leave it.  Maybe.  I'll put mine up. 
[02:14:00]  Just because somebody could be going into it.  They don't know who you are.  They'll read a couple of your tweets.  Oh, this guy's a funny guy.  Let me follow him.  That's true.  Does that happen?  For me?  No, we've got it on my website.  So I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  You've got a great website.  Thank you.  It's called notsam.com.  It's a great website.  Well, yeah, because it's simple.  Yeah.  And it's exactly what it should be.  I never knew how to do that.  I'm like, what's the difference between linking?  Embed.  I never knew how to do that. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  That seems fun.  Oh, look at that.  It's got a very Apple feel to it.  Yeah, real close up.  It is.  Very white and clean.  Unlike you.  Exactly.  You're tainted.  I said, hold on.  Go back.  Can I go back?  I love the fucking awful photo montage of Sam in action.  There's one where his close up of his face, and there's one where he's making a statement.  These are the worst pictures of Sam.  The one with him and Who Kid.  And the Muppets.  I really think.  It's Who Kid and Who Cares. 
[02:15:00]  We know which one you are.  Who Kid and Who Cares.  I mean, this is all you need.  All your links up top.  That was just goddamn mean.  About podcast videos.  All your links.  I don't like this.  Insta Sam.  I just added that, because before it was just a pictures page.  Ew.  Ew.  Now it's called Insta Sam.  I don't like that.  Ew.  Instead of Instagram.  Do you realize? 
[02:15:30]  Because I realize my name Sam rhymes with Graham.  Yeah.  I could just write Insta Sam.  It also rhymes with Sham.  Not Sham Live.  Insta Sam.  Oh, fucking Boo.  Yeah.  Boo with a capital B and capital O's.  You have a good radio name, though.  Sam Roberts?  Yeah, your last name is like a first name.  Yeah.  They like those interchangeable first name.  Olivia Munn thought I should be the president of the United States with that name.  Really?  That's right.  President Roberts? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Samuel Wood Roberts.  True.  Here's where it's good.  I don't have to do a lot of scrolling.  And not a lot of clicking, either.  No.  Done.  Right.  My front page is very simple.  It just has links.  Photos, merchandise, tour dates.  For videos, though, what do you do to show videos?  I put them up on YouTube.  You do?  And then, like, every...  And then there's...  Like, video?  What's that?  Let's say I wanted to link to the Chip Comic Con video.  I would just embed the link, right?  Oh, look at that.  Put them up on YouTube.  In a second.  It's right there.  Sam's got a little thing here.  News and stuff.  Here's the latest video. 
[02:16:30]  And then you click the Ultimate Warrior.  That's the latest.  And there he is.  Right.  I wrote a video.  And then...  There he is.  Scroll to the top.  Okay.  If you want to see all the videos, see the thing that says videos?  Videos.  Yeah.  At the very top of the page.  Ah, I can't click on it.  It's broken.  Oh.  Yeah.  And that's all your videos.  And that's literally just everything that's on YouTube.  Oh, man.  But that's a pretty nice page right there.  It's simple.  Don't overthink it.  Different pages.  Yeah.  No, I don't want to overthink it.  I just want it to be, like...  But some people do.  That's pretty good.  Good.  I want it to be mine.  It's like when you get, like, iMovie for the first time and you have to add in, like, 
[02:17:00]  every transition and effect.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you realize, no, no, no.  Just keep it clean.  Look at angelic Bob Kelly on his.  You don't think I need a whole shitload of, uh...  Can I embed video on the front page?  You bet you can, Jimmy.  Hell, yes.  This is going to be crazy.  This is going to be nuts.  Hell, yes.  Embedding video on the front page?  It's, like, the first thing they see.  No, I don't want to embed anything on the front page.  I want it to be simple.  I have a thing where I can put announcements up, but then I can take them off if I don't want  them up there.  That's the one thing I don't like about it.  You mean you can edit your page? 
[02:17:30]  No, but I don't like where the announcements are.  Like, I don't know.  That's incredible.  Yeah, once I put up that, like, oh, I just, you know, did a video with the Ultimate Warrior,  there ain't no taking that off.  It's there forever.  It's there forever.  I'm just kidding.  I could easily take it off.  Wait, will you have an announcement on your front page for a few days and then you remove  it?  No, I leave it up and then there's, like, the first six or whatever on the front page.  Ah.  And so the newest one will take the place of the oldest one.  Oh, I see.  News?  No, my front page is just a picture.  I want it to be like MySpace, where you click on it and it opens and five videos and eight 
[02:18:00]  songs start playing at the same time.  See, I don't like that.  Oh, Jimmy.  Your cursor becomes something else, like a fairy.  Hey, why do they call it that?  What's it, profanity or something?  The background takes fucking 15 minutes to load because it's fucking full motion HD  video.  Me and my web guy had an argument.  I wanted to just look like an Angel Fire webpage with, like, dancing bananas and all kinds  of animated birthday cake gifts.  Angel Fire.  Nice.  But he wanted to go for something that's... 
[02:18:30]  He's more of a Geocity guy.  Do you think Simple and people are better with Simple now?  Of course.  It's Simple.  They don't mind.  I feel like there's not a whole lot of...  Like, you don't, like, load it.  It goes...  Jim Norton.  It should.  Look at the attention span of this country.  Like, people...  What's that?  I'm bored.  Like, you need to...  There have been times where if I go to a website and I don't immediately find what  I'm looking for, I'll go find it somewhere else.  Yeah.  Right, and then you realize you spelled it G-U-E porn.  Instead of gay. 
[02:19:00]  Stretch.  Yeah.  I fucked up.  I was trying to misspell gay accidentally, but then I was spelling G-U-Y and I'm like,  oh, that still works.  I'm trying to put G-U-E.  My improv was wrong, so I had to fix it.  It made it wronger.  You've got to have your content on, like, you know, your other spots, like YouTube and,  you know...  You do.  You don't just load it all up, right?  No.  You put it...  That way you get credit with the social media.  Who has Jim Norton, though, for YouTube?  I don't know.  I don't know my... 
[02:19:30]  Someone has that.  See who it is.  And all, like, the Chip Comic Con videos and stuff, I think they're on their own.  I think Chip has his own YouTube page.  Chip-a-TV.  Do you know the passwords for that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll give it all to you.  No one?  Let me see.  I'm sure whoever has Jim Norton at Gmail has, because it's all owned by Google.  It's all one big happy family.  That would probably be beneficial to your career if you did have it.  But if his name's Jim Norton, you're not going to be able to get it.  Not legally, but you ask him for it.  Sometimes people will...  I don't know.  If I'm just regular old Jim Norton from Missouri, I'm probably not going to give some other 
[02:20:00]  Jim Norton my...  If I pay you for it, you would.  How much are you going to pay me?  Two million!  All right, let's take it.  It's tough now, though, because usually the YouTube username is the same as the Gmail  email address.  So the guy who's got Jim Norton at Gmail.com, like Travis said...  He just said that.  He doesn't want to give up...  Yeah, then he's got to change his email address.  Right.  Oh, okay.  Maybe not.  All right.  Whatever.  But you could just do whatever.  What's your Gmail address?  The real Jim Norton is my story.  So then make the real Jim Norton at YouTube and the real Jim Norton...  Yeah, you know what?  It's actually...  Thank God for Google, because you just Google it and people can take you to it. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  Google.  I'm so easy to find.  I was just thinking that.  I was just thinking that, too.  So you already have your YouTube page set up.  No, but I don't...  But that's not connected to my...  Do I?  Yeah.  This is the real Jim Norton.  This is Fishing a Sport by Jim Norton.  That's not me.  I didn't put that up.  Oh, boy.  Someone uploaded it three years ago.  That's not me.  Uh-oh.  You're not the real Jim Norton?  Yeah!  It says that that's the real...  No, no, no.  That says that's the real Jim Norton.  That guy says he's the real Jim Norton.  But that guy...  My email...  Wouldn't that have to be him, though? 
[02:21:00]  No.  Obviously not.  What is it?  Is it a fake Jim Norton, or what does it say?  But it says the real Jim Norton.  All right.  So that's the real Jim.  How do we contact that person?  You're not real.  I am real.  Yeah, no.  I'll do...  I am real.  We can do the show with that guy.  Yeah.  Because he's the real Jim Norton.  He's got a video.  He's got one video.  How many do you have?  In three years.  I don't...  Oh.  See?  You just have to add all your YouTube videos to Chip TV Show.  Oh, I know what I could do.  I could just fucking...  I could just do something like Jim Norton's 16, 490.  Yeah, those are always good. 
[02:21:30]  I love the recommendations.  Oh, that's been taken.  Here's some recommendations for you.  Some random five-digit number.  Yeah, that's real catchy.  Anthony C, 2145.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Easily remembered.  I hate it when things are not Sam is taken on things.  Yeah.  You're kind of tough, too, because Sam Roberts is already a famous name.  Very common.  Yeah.  OB Radio.  OB was smart to go with that, because OB Radio is just...  It's simple.  It's easy to remember.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I don't...  Jim Norton, because there's an acting agent. 
[02:22:00]  How about Jim Comedy?  Ugh.  Ew.  How about Funny Jimmy?  Jimmy Ha Ha.  Yeah.  How about Jimmy Jokes?  Jimmy Jokes.  Ah, Jimmy Jokes.  Jim Norton.  How about Jim Norton Smiles?  Oh, no.  Hit me up on YouTube at Jimmy Smiles.  Yeah, Jimmy Smiles.  It's just videos of you smiling.  You should change your Twitter name to Jimmy Smiles.  Jimmy Smiles.  Yeah, Jimmy Smiles.  With a Z.  I do make people smile.  You do?  Awful name.  I'd love to have a tally of all the smiles I give on a day. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my goodness.  It's probably miles of smiles.  Probably.  Why don't we take a break and see if Dice is going to make his way here, right?  Yeah.  I think they said at six...  Is he doing Howard first?  Yeah.  Oh.  What's going on in there?  Are they on good terms or shitty terms?  Over the years, it's been like a fucking soap opera over there.  You're talking about over there or over here?  Dice is an asshole.  Fuck Dice.  Dice is one of my close friends. 
[02:23:00]  I didn't even know Howard was in today.  Was he in?  Okay.  Maybe Dice is just sitting there.  Where is everybody?  Hey, he's not here.  Oh, great.  All right.  Yeah.  We'll take a break.  See if Dice is...  I want to see Jim Carrey's website, too.  Exactly.  But Jim Carrey probably spent a lot of money on his website.  And I don't need what Jim Carrey has.  Jim Carrey probably is just...  He's so fucking famous and rich.  He's bored.  Look at Jim Carrey's website.  That's it?  No, that's not it. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, right.  With the animation and everything?  Oh, he's got a lot of animation.  You don't need that bullshit.  Yeah.  I don't like having to, like, X out of this.  No.  And, like, everything's a mystery.  I want to know what I'm clicking.  That is pretty amazing, though.  That's an amazing website.  It looks good.  How much do you think that costs?  A little blimp comes by with it.  Over $400.  Come on.  Look at that.  Wow.  I bet this is his Twitter.  It's a little birdie.  Yeah.  I don't like having to guess all that stuff.  Yeah.  No way.  A lot of people started doing that years ago.  It's like, what am I clicking on right here? 
[02:24:00]  Is this a brand new fucking looking website?  I don't need...  I feel like I should have that.  No.  What am I doing here?  No.  God, no.  Just get a simple thing.  I don't know what I'm clicking on.  What are you clicking on?  What's going on?  A giant octopus just took you somewhere.  This is amazing, but I don't want to do it.  Look at that sight.  It is amazing.  Really.  You need...  How expensive is that, though?  Would that be good on the...  How many questions am I going to ask?  I'm not Jim Carrey.  All you need is somebody to go to your Twitter.  They find you.  Oh, jimnorton.com.  Where's the dates?  Now pay to go see him perform stand-up. 
[02:24:30]  No, but I'm looking at a guy who makes 20 million of film.  He's iconic.  And I'm like, why don't I have that website?  Because it's probably a million dollar website.  We're going somewhere.  Whoa.  I don't know where I am now.  See, how do you do that in WordPress?  WordPress.  Now he's on the big satellite dish from...  Cable Guy.  Cable Guy.  Yeah, what theme is this?  It's like all of his movies.  It's all his movies.  Yeah, yeah.  What theme did he use?  Oh, I used to do a bunch of one-line things.  Did he use world map? 
[02:25:00]  Try something else.  I am.  We're counting down.  What's the 9-8?  Can you make this...  It's counting down to where we're going next.  And then we go somewhere else.  Yep.  Can you use iWeb to make this?  It shoots us over.  Okay.  Here we go.  Whoa.  Oh, now we're in like...  This is scary.  In hell.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I see.  It's our studio.  That's an amazing site.  Gotta give him that.  Yeah, I mean, it's cool.  Yeah.  But this is more like...  I would go to this site to have fun.  Right.  Not to find Jim Carrey. 
[02:25:30]  No.  Yeah, if I clicked on something and it took me to his Twitter page, I'd be pissed off.  I'm not on his fun website anymore.  Oh, we're going somewhere.  Whoa.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  It's sexy time.  Now he's...  There's Ace Ventura.  Up in the clouds.  I'm going to click on Ace and see what happens.  All right.  Here we go.  Did he just build his website right for football?  He just shit out of football.  For fun?  Maybe.  There's no money to be made of.  Click on the spaceman.  All right.  Oh.  Oh, the little hatch opens.  The hat opens and it's the Jim Carrey face.  And that's all?  He's just having a good time.  Do you think he'd go for it or no?  Click on new Jim Carrey.  Click on new Jim Carrey. 
[02:26:00]  I did.  Nothing?  Yeah.  What do you think?  His peck is going to fall out of the clouds?  Oh.  Now we're going somewhere again.  This is a very fun looking site though.  Wow.  Oh, we're back.  We're back in heck.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah.  We'll take a break and I'll be right back.  Thank you.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  The OPN Anthony Show. 
[02:26:30]  Continues.  Oh.  Hi, everybody.  I guess we're supposed to be waiting for Dice.  But he's over at Howard, I guess, with Adam Carolla and Howard and Dice.  And they're all talking.  So I'm just looking at the clock.  Tick tock.  Yes, Kenny?  The pool in your hotel is a saltwater pool.  That's okay. 
[02:27:00]  Mine is too.  I want a saltwater pool.  I have one at my house.  Ours is tap.  It's tap water.  Tap water.  It's a hose.  They just cracked open a fire hydrant outside the hotel.  Me and Travis are going to plane it in our skivvies.  It was such a nice weekend.  At the house.  Oh, just relaxing by the pool.  Just tweeting horrible things.  I was going to say.  Relaxed.  Sounds relaxing.  Well, everyone gets the impression that I sit there just fucking going crazy, 
[02:27:30]  tweeting all these things that I tweet about, like the Trayvon Martin thing and everything.  But, no, I'm poolside.  I'm sitting there.  I'm drinking a beer.  I got the 70s on 7 playing here on XM Satellite Radio.  Nice, nice crossover right there.  Yeah.  I just did.  My cross promotion.  You ever hear of Denny?  I've heard of this guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think that kid will go far.  I saw Denny when I left Friday. 
[02:28:00]  I have a little chit chat with him while we're going to the elevator.  Not many people get by Denny without some chit chat.  Without a little bit of chit chat.  Ain't that the truth?  But, oh, it was so nice just fucking doing that.  And then last night, there was nothing on.  And I figured, you know what?  Let me give this Orange is the New Black a try.  Oh, God.  The female prison fucking show.  Yeah.  On Netflix.  Now, because I'm thinking, and I'm sure I'm like a lot of people, I'm thinking Netflix 
[02:28:30]  original programming.  Hmm.  What did they have?  That Lily Hammer show for a while?  They had Lily Hammer.  They had House of Cards.  Right.  Kevin Spacey.  Yes.  Where Kevin Spacey, every week, he would join up with another celebrity and they would build  card houses.  Correct.  And see who put the last piece on.  Like a reality thing.  And the last person to do it before it fell, they'd have to use the stamps to go to the  trading stamps to go get either a canoe or, what did the girls want at the pretty house? 
[02:29:00]  No idea what you're talking about.  I think the boys wanted a canoe.  A sewing machine.  Very good.  Stupid breaking funds.  What was that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But unfortunately, the girls got their dad to help lick those trading stamps.  And when they handed them to the guy behind the counter, he dropped dead.  So the girls wanted a sewing machine and the boys wanted a father who didn't jerk off whenever 
[02:29:30]  he saw them without their underpants on.  I don't think you could get that with S&H trading stamps.  Is that even something that anybody, how old do you have to be to remember trading stamps?  How old do you have to be to know stamps?  Nobody mails anything.  I know.  These weren't mailing stamps, though.  You go to the store, right?  And you'd buy something.  And they would go, yes, we have S&H trading stamps. 
[02:30:00]  We have green stamps here.  And you'd buy something and they would tear off a thing of stamps.  And you'd have a stamp book.  And then you'd fill up the pages with these big, like, with stamps.  They were the size of a postage stamp.  Like when you go to Disney World and all the kids are trading pins?  Yeah, but you would just have the one.  You wouldn't trade them.  Because you couldn't get it out of your stamp book.  Yeah, you couldn't get it out of your stamp book.  You just went to the store and bought a stamp and then put it in a book?  No, you would buy things and they would give you the stamps for the amount that you bought. 
[02:30:30]  Like, oh, you bought $50 in groceries.  Here's 18 trading stamps.  And they're valueless, these stamps.  Valueless to a point.  You'd fill up the book.  And then for 50 full books of trading stamps, you'd go to the S&H trading stamp place.  And you could get something like a sewing machine or something.  Would you have to go there or could you order it online?  Online.  Let me see his trading stamp, what they had.  It was.  Were these kind of like sticker books? 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  I remember sticker books.  What a scam.  They're still around.  It wasn't a scam.  It was just a thing.  No, it was a scam to try to get you to buy more shit.  So that way you get stamps and trade it in for some bullshit.  See, there they are.  Click up a picture.  Here's the second link is an article from 1987, New York Times.  What's new in trading stamps?  They still had trading stamps in 87.  Look, see, that's what they looked like.  That's not cool.  S&H green stamps.  I do remember them.  God, I remember those fucking...  See, there you go.  And now you'd pop them.  See that?  What are they called? 
[02:31:30]  Green stamps?  They were S&H green stamps.  By Green with Envy.  No.  No.  Yes, Kenny?  I kind of remember.  Well, it's kind of like when you have a credit card and you get rewards points.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  See, Sam doesn't remember that either.  There you go.  Exactly, because he's never gotten a reward.  Paste three tens.  Oh, so they're like fives and tens.  Paste three tens.  Oh, they would come in different denominations.  So it is.  It's reward points, except it's physical.  Yes. 
[02:32:00]  That sucks.  That's physical stamps.  Like you're holding your reward points.  You have to keep track of your reward points.  Everything wasn't electronical back in the day.  I remember these, but not as rewards.  Like this was more like sticker books, where you bought like a Masters of the Universe, you  know, stamps thing.  Well, I remember collecting stamps, but not saving up shitty number stamps to trade them  in.  I found some Lou Gehrig stamps over the weekend, and I thought, oh.  Oh, no, they would move.  They were just stuck to the page, motionless. 
[02:32:30]  We got it, Jim, the first time you said it.  And I thought they might be worth something, because I was like, oh, you know, they're 25  cents.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I go on eBay, three, four dollars.  What year are they from?  I don't remember, but like.  Oh, they're probably recent.  That's why.  No, they're not recent.  They were in like all my old baseball cards, which are just worth absolutely garbage.  Garbage.  The ones that used to be worth money are still worth okay money, but it's the ones that they  pumped out after.  The Don Russ, Frank Thomas, Sideway Hat Edition.  Cards from the 80s. 
[02:33:00]  Sideway Hat Edition.  Cards from the 80s and 90s are worth pennies, if that.  There's like 10, maybe.  Ricky Henderson's rookie card.  Let's look that up.  It's probably not worth that much.  It was worth $100 years ago.  Now it's not worth shit unless you get it graded, and it's not worth shit unless it's  graded 10.  And if it's not a 10, then nobody fucking wants it.  Jam mint tan condition.  Jam mint tan.  Let's open this up.  Is the idea that your mom would go grocery shopping and then the kids would get the stamps?  No, no.  The mom did the stamps because she would get stuff she wanted. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, look.  A comforter.  I could get a comforter for this many books.  They used to have a little hot fan that you'd put, and it was called a cunt warmer, and it  had a clip that could go on the front of your office chair, and every lady wanted a cunt  warming fan.  A cunt warmer.  A cunt warmer.  All 41 bucks?  All right.  So here's one that's rated 9 mint.  It's 320 so far. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, it's okay.  It's $320, right?  Yeah, but I mean, this was 1980.  I'm talking about stuff that was like 85 to 95.  Filter it highest price to lowest and see what the fuck we got here.  Like when they just completely oversaturated the market.  Right, right.  That's what those cards are all worth.  When everyone bought them just to collect.  Wait, wait.  Now go up all the way.  No, I'm not going to see what people are asking.  It's $4,400.  That's not what it's worth.  That's what they're...  Oh, you're the guy from Pawn Stars?  Exactly.  Just because they're selling it.  Because people come in, they go, I've seen this online for $4,000. 
[02:34:30]  And they'll be like, yeah, people can sell it for whatever they want.  You can ask whatever you want.  Yeah, that's not what I'm giving you.  I'll give you 25 cents for it.  Okay.  I'm going to get some bubble gum.  PSA Mint 9, $398.  Okay, so...  That's about $400.  That's about what I expected.  I thought it was $100 and something, so...  Yeah.  How about...  I just want to name baseball cards I used to have.  That's exciting.  I remember when I was collecting the 1979 Topps set.  It's the only set I ever collected.  Topps was all you got.  I couldn't get Alan Bannister from the White Sox.  That was the last card.  Incredible Hulk.  My friend Neil Grant had it, and he gave it to me. 
[02:35:00]  I remember I traded it.  I couldn't believe you had Alan Bannister.  So I got it, and he gave it to me in tin foil, and I traded him a couple of cards for it.  I probably traded him good ones.  Six Munson's and a Reggie for an Alan Bannister.  Oof.  Why would you want that?  He was the last one on the set.  Oh, God.  That was it.  You dope.  Yeah, I went for $26 the other day.  Is it really?  Yeah, and that's a Gem Mint 10.  I couldn't believe my Alan Bannister.  That was so hard to get.  It's such an awful-looking card, too.  Yeah, and it's like you think you've got these cards that might be worth something, but you  know, if they're not properly centered, and if the corner... 
[02:35:30]  Right, right.  Everything's a problem.  How much is the 1979 top set worth?  They had a fucking...  There was a good Reggie Jackson in that one, and that was Thurman's last card.  Oh.  I remember when he died, I wrote the date of his death on the card.  What a dummy.  Exactly.  Gem Mint douche, I was.  You wrote the date of it.  Look at that.  How much?  Oh.  I mean...  Two bucks.  1979, tops, baseball, lot, complete, $4. 
[02:36:00]  $4?  No, this is the pick 20 cards.  No, you fucking dork.  The entire set.  The whole set.  The set that a little eager boy collected.  Aw.  Hi, I got a Reggie!  $55.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  1979, tops, baseball, set, near complete.  Near.  725 cards, Mint.  $55.  Exactly.  Near complete.  No one knows that guy.  There was a couple of good ones in there.  The top 78 one had Eddie Murray's rookie card.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have that.  I used to flip.  It's worth nothing.  Eddie Murray's rookie card? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, you know why mine's worth nothing?  It's yours.  It's got like a corner ding on it.  What's a corner ding?  It's got a soft corner.  It's a little flattened out corner.  It's still worth it.  You're just looking in the wrong places.  No.  You have to have these things in perfect condition.  Are my X-Men Marvel masterpieces worth anything?  Those Marvel masterpieces were some fucking nice cards.  Yeah.  I thought I had some.  I have Planet of the Apes cards, like from the fucking movie.  I have some really old ones.  And they're worth no money either.  I went to public school in a low-income area. 
[02:37:00]  So I used to have to, if I was going to bring my Marvel cards to school, my mom would make  me put a lock on my book bag because I brought them in one time and they all got stolen.  Of course they did.  Of course they did.  And then one time I brought in my Pogs and they got stolen too.  What are Pogs?  You don't remember Pogs?  No, I don't.  Pogs are the shit.  I had a custom-made Big Daddy Cool Diesel Slammer and somebody stole it.  Enough times gone by where I could reference it now and say, well, they probably thought  they were family photos. 
[02:37:30]  There it is.  Now I've made the circle.  Yeah, yeah.  Travis, it took a little while, but that's okay.  They'd steal your Marvel cards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd go to gym class and then I'd come back and my binder would be gone.  Your binder?  I had my cards in a binder.  What cards did you have?  Marvel Masterpieces. 
[02:38:00]  What are those?  Those are all my X-Men cards.  What's the shit in third grade?  Except people stole them all the time because I went to school in a low-income area.  But the X-Men stuff, if you want X-Men stuff that's worth money, it's got to be the comic  books.  X-Men 94.  Back then it was like you'd go to the store and you'd get a pack of X-Men cards.  There was a time, like a few years back, where things were valuable, the older things, but  then they started selling things that they thought would be collectible. 
[02:38:30]  And so many people bought them that it's not collectible anymore.  There's just too much of it out there.  A lot of something.  Yeah.  Like, I was reading some article about cards the other day and it's like, you know, this  Shaq rookie card that was one of 85,000.  Well, now it's not collectible.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My goof mom has drawers full of Beanie Babies.  Oh, the Beanie Baby craze.  Yeah.  Where everyone thought they were going to be fucking worth money.  Cashing out and paying off that mortgage.  Yeah, yeah.  And they all have the plastic protectors on the tags to make sure, because once the tag 
[02:39:00]  got bent, this increased in value, this Beanie Baby, we have the Beanie Unicorn.  Yeah.  And this is a coveted, and it's trying to say that they, you know, were worth thousands  of dollars.  How many people do you think saved their Pokemon Charizard card?  Oh, yeah.  Was that a biggie?  That's what I remember.  That was like the big one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't even tell you.  My brother used to get on board with every single trend. 
[02:39:30]  He was all about Beanie Babies.  Oh, no.  He was all about Pokemons.  He was all about Tamagotchis.  Everything.  I was all about Pokemon when we were selling them at Burger King, and I was...  You're all about robbing Burger King for their Happy Meal toys.  Yeah, and I was taking them and selling complete sets on eBay.  Damn.  You asshole.  You thief.  Nah.  Is this, uh...  I see somebody walking.  Nah, that's the photographer.  I got a picture of me waiting for Andrew.  I think he's still on Howard.  Oh, okay.  We could do that, then.  I don't want to stop the whole...  Stop the whole rigmarole? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Wasn't I talking about fucking Orange is the New Black?  Orange is the New Black.  I don't know what happened there.  We should see one of those...  Oh, Kenny?  Yes.  One of those girls was being pitched to us.  I would love to...  Yes.  And I met one of them at the cellar.  She was beautiful.  Fucking, uh...  What's up, Kenny?  Yeah, Kenny?

[02:50:00]  almost like embarrassing well you know well you know what i i really showed up to do a great job  because i knew the kind of like actors i was going to work with huge you know what i mean you're working  with alec and cape blanchard and you know these are the you know sally hawkins golden globe winners  uh-huh so i was like i really got to bring an a-game and i didn't do a movie in 12 years  jesus you know but you know when i see these like you know the wall street journal you know the way 
[02:50:30]  to write me up and you know i'm like this is the craziest thing i've ever been involved you know  what i'm seeing here dice and i'm not i'm not kidding around either no what this i know we're just  talking now this could be the fucking john travolta pulp fiction thing for you but that's what  they're saying they're talking about mickey rock and the wrestler but uh-huh but i'm like  these guys i mean guys like mickey rock to me are the best yeah yeah i mean you know to me he's one  of the greatest actors just ever he just is yeah you know so i understood that and he's the star of 
[02:51:00]  that movie you know what i mean yeah and even though travolta you know was a supporting role in pulp  fiction it was still a giant part sure you know what i mean and so i get but wait you know this is  really it set me back a little i'm i'm pretty like overwhelmed a little humbled i'm very humbled  yeah yeah i mean i'm talking to you now just straight i mean i i feel like i really hope i  did as good a job as what he's been saying and and and that's all i wanted to do what's uh what's 
[02:51:30]  you know because well you know he's he's a very regular guy you know what i mean he's a guy that's  gone through a lot of stuff which i can relate to you know but you know i i had to go pretty deep  you know it's like i got my own method of acting i know how to get there but you know i i just can't  believe the press on this yeah yeah you know i mean the ap came out uh associated press the other  night to take pictures when i was in vegas vinyl which i've done the ap before yes and they never 
[02:52:00]  send anybody to take pictures and the guy said honestly dice this is the biggest story in showbiz  right now wow i'm like you're kidding me you know because i'm playing vinyl i'm at the hard rock in  vegas and i'm like this is all going on around me i like don't even get it you know and big premiere  yeah i haven't felt this honestly since since 88 since the rodney special see when the rodney special  aired i knew what had happened you know that i would even talk to dennis back then when he you know 
[02:52:30]  when i was doing like rascals 28 shows in a row and he was looking to put me like in 500 seat rooms  and i'm like it's bigger than that and i think the only way to prove it was to have him put me on  sale somebody somewhere else in the country because he felt it was territorial and he put me in phoenix  at the theater uh celebrity theater one show but they sold three in one day and that's when he realized  this isn't normal you know and i haven't had that feeling i feel very like uh 
[02:53:00]  like elevated like my whole mind my whole mood about this whole thing it's time i mean and  like you know people have been asking me like what if you had to pick like three things  in your career that really would mark you i said well the rodney special because that just blew me  through the roof oh yeah then when i was doing the arenas you know led to madison square garden yeah  and now this woody movie because it's it's the shot of a lifetime oh shit but i didn't know when 
[02:53:30]  i was doing it i just really wanted to do a great job for him how did you read for him because if  woody doesn't like a performance yeah he'll throw it out and just cast somebody else and reshoot it  yeah he did that to kramer well i you know but that's that's what he does that's why his movie  like he'll go the guy's not getting it get rid of him and get me the right actor yeah you know so  when i'm on that set it's like just do a great job these pretzels are making me thirsty something  like that you deliver the line like that oh but that's not that's not what i'm doing i know how 
[02:54:00]  did you how did you how did you read for him you go you meet with him and then he just hands you a  script i hear you i went in there and it was very loose and he was with the uh casting lady and the  producer and he was very cool very laid back and you know we're doing a film and uh would you read a  few pages you know and i'm like can you give me something to go on you know and he goes well you  know he's you just take a look you know and and i went in another room with the casting i went through 
[02:54:30]  two pages i said i got this let's go in but she was like uh are you sure because i only went through  it the one time but i could see what it was so i do it for him and i go look i don't even know if  the guy's from the east coast you know i don't know anything if you want i'll do it again and he  goes well you have the essence it was perfect and i was like all right you know i guess i'll see you  on the set you know but when i when i actually got the text that i didn't even open it from my manager 
[02:55:00]  uh bruce you know and i just saw you got the you know it was an emotional thing for me wow you know  because you know number one it's like something my parents would have always wanted to see me do  anytime i would do a movie i mean my mother loved that i was the comic i am and but like if i get  a movie she'd go is it is it a drama yeah she loved dramatic she knew i could do the drama yeah and i  go well mom i'm a comic it's it's like a comedy you know but this is like something they would have  just loved i mean you know i could just see them talking about it you know i've seen you act 
[02:55:30]  you know and and act like you know where you wouldn't even know what it was you're talking about  like crime story years ago but even that was more animated yeah yeah yeah you know this isn't as  animated but i saw no even like early way early on like in fucking mash when you were in mash i  remember that it was like fucking holy shit that was their last halloween episode was it yeah you  know that was the that was the last year they were on i was like i couldn't believe i got that back 
[02:56:00]  then yeah that was the beginning it was one of the first parts i ever got yeah you know and then  the whole dice thing went crazy like eight years later you know you know it's been a very interesting  career very shit you know no i know you know you've been part of a big part of it you know  you've been part of a bit everybody here's been yeah yeah he has not been oh no i don't know this  fucking guy and i don't trust him good you know what i mean instinct you know any guy that looks at  me like dad i don't trust yeah but anyway no i'm just fucking with you know that right

[02:57:30]  what it is it's almost at the point where i felt like weathermen you know like when it used to hit  like 90 degrees like it would be like if you don't have to go out don't go out you know even here you  know yeah but there they go 108 18 i'm waiting for a guy like the weather guy to come on like in a  tank top and shorts going you wouldn't fucking believe this shit 135 just stay the fucking do yourself  a favor find some broad bury your balls in a fucking grease pit and have a good night

[02:59:00]  his own podcast to get me to do a podcast oh is that how he got you oh yeah that's how he scams me  into every fucking thing right you know why are you doing a podcast well i just like doing it you  know and then he gets me to do rolling with dice and wheels but rogan was right and uh you know we're  only on like two and a half months but we got over 200 000 followers wow shit you know uh we were told  by itunes we'll probably hit over a million by like october i mean it's it's a real freak thing what 
[02:59:30]  kind of show what do you well we roll we go anywhere we've we've broken into uh we we broke into a  foreclosed home a few weeks ago and barbecued you know because i don't like being stuck like in a  studio oh like i couldn't do this all day yeah believe me be inside like like our first one was  in the desert yeah you know like a half hour outside of vegas you know like just oh man that's  where they dump the bodies yeah he's going why do we got to be here i go because i don't need to be  inside you know wheels is funny because he's like we're inside we're 80 miles outside of town you know

[03:00:30]  the tv okay all right now i'm kind of getting the drift we just live it you know what i mean like  whatever hat there's no format there's no structure you know i really don't know what i'm doing you  know me yeah you know i just wing it and uh you know and now and then we have a guest yeah did you  do it norton i've never been invited oh man i would love you to do it but i don't want to he was in  vegas for that i'm not going to break his balls do my podcast right because i don't even give a fuck 
[03:01:00]  if we have a guest i i actually hate when we have guests because then you gotta like ask questions  yeah yeah yeah you know about somebody you know well him i love but you know if you have somebody  else on like i want to say i don't even give a fuck about you who you had on so uh well who  last comic we had on was uh oh i don't know can i say a funny thing boden  you know so boden kenny might know okay alonzo boden yeah kenny yeah yes kenny you want to ask

[03:02:00]  like says like no but we're not going anywhere yeah yeah you know so we're not back we're still here  well that'll probably come in handy if you do get some sponsors and then they cut the show up and play  it again they could put the commercials right there where you said that yeah but i didn't even  understand that part because like all wheels does is take money from me to buy shit uh-huh  oh you know and i'll see like three new wires i'll go i gave you 1700 dollars and he goes yeah but i 
[03:02:30]  got the wires look at the mic we got good headphones i'll save it because that's 17 he knows you don't  you know the electronics i don't even have time to like think about it you know what i mean it's like  i just want it to go good yeah yeah yeah watch we'll be right back i say that yeah and that was  smooth but then you're still there yeah well you know it's rolling with dice and wheels yeah  i never claimed to be the brightest no no you know what i mean i i no but i do like i do like the  sound of it sounds very cool if you want to get some t-shirts well that is nice you know i mean

[03:16:30]  what i mean so yeah i might have got heavy but it took that same guy to take it off yeah you know  nobody could do that but it's not even about taking the weight it's about just being physically fit that  when i get on stage people will say yeah i might not have as much hair you know what i mean remember  that remember when you could put a comb to your head and there was actual hair on it you know how  i pick on guys in the crowd i go remember when you could stand your feet and feel your fucking toes

[03:24:00]  you you will be uh pleasantly surprised by a lot of the comedians that end up on that show  let's start with 302 you're on after opie anthony live hollywood prime time sammy sweetheart the  effin roberts professional broadcaster world-renowned professional wrestling expert as well as originator  of the blatantly stolen lonely virtual concept yeah just had to go the full monkey today sammy how are  good larry how are you i'm feeling fine this frog chair split three ways right um one of my neighbors 
[03:24:30]  where the wife lives since i live in my truck and visit my wife at her house that's where your  relationship is at you're living in your truck well of course we've been married 33 years sam there's  you know there's not a lot of um well there's you know it's not a lot of mystery left you know what i'm  saying so you do what do you like park your truck outside your house well i i park it on the road 
[03:25:00]  and then walk the mile into where the wife lives just about a mile and a quarter mile mile and a  quarter back where she lives why even see her anymore well i don't see her all that often sammy but  that's not the reason i called oh yeah i mean i would imagine if you're at the point where you're not  living with your wife it probably wouldn't be worth walking there's not much to me that's worth  walking a mile for that seems like a lot of physical effort eric could you ever see yourself  walking a mile to see somebody that you're supposed to live with anyway that i'm supposed to live with 
[03:25:30]  no right yeah i don't see it happening but larry how often do you walk the mile to see your wife  um i'm not scheduled to go home anytime soon and i was home for a day a month and a half or two months  ago okay so you're you're looking at maybe four to five times a year uh yeah depending on weather  because when she was snowed in during a real bad winter i had to go home quite frequently and hike  her groceries into her a mile yes oh my gosh she would have she would have if it were me larry you're 
[03:26:00]  a better man than me because if i were in your position she simply would have starved to death  well no sam i mean she's my wife we've been buried a long time yeah i understand but a mile in the snow  is a mile in the snow well you do what you got to do sammy it's the mile in it's downhill it's  the mile out the bed it's all up hill jesus christ it's rough jesus christ the reason i called sammy  the reason i called yeah one of my neighbors is a retired missionary and his son is in the mission field 
[03:26:30]  and they were in mexico and going to a church that they'd helped start down there as part of  their mission going to a service and they got carjacked by some mexicans and left on the side  of the road so they were walking it's terrifying other mexicans rolled up and picked the guy up like  what the hell you doing here you know and picked them up he said look we got carjacked and this and  that and he took them to another facility where a guy was and he says you got carjacked he says yeah  and he said was it these guys and he starts showing them heads and he's like yeah it was 
[03:27:00]  those guys he said you have to be careful take them back to their car and then they took the guy  back to the cars we could go get his wife and kids they showed they wait wait they showed this couple  not photos but the actual severed heads yes just the man they left the wife and kids on the side of  the road took him and he said when he got carjacked i guess they found these guys decapitated them and  said where'd they get this car and it was his car and he showed them the heads to say well he's 
[03:27:30]  the guy he's a carjacked and he's like yeah those were the one they left the car what part of mexico  were you were they in i were down central mexico that's what i never and then and the guy's a  missionary and he brought his family well yeah that he was in the mission field his job he's a  missionary he was down there going to a church service and the church they found it look you church  people have got to realize there are some places that god just doesn't go and it's not up to you  to bring him there well sam that's not how they think because to live is christ and to die is gain 
[03:28:00]  to be absent from the body to be present with the lord so they have yeah but you could be you could be  as present with the lord as you want to be if your method of becoming present with the lord is watching  your family get decapitated on the side of a mexican highway i'm good on my own well people do this  sam there's been many missionaries killed i had relatives in the mission field myself it's a  terrible job well you go where the good lord leads you sammy i guess but i i'd be to call and 
[03:28:30]  say hi to you my man sam i'd be see the lord steered you in the right direction if the lord steered me  towards i don't know like the the rain forest or the central mexico or wherever is going on i'd be  pissed at the lord personally well they look at it different sam they serve a master but they ended up  they ended up okay oh yeah they ended up just fine they went to church service and because the  bible says no weapon of foreign informed against me shall prosper so they're sitting there and now  they can do this church service and they can explain to everybody that you know they got to 
[03:29:00]  see some crazy shit but the lord safely uh allowed them to evacuate yeah but the lord shielded his  wife and children right she just never that's just him oh my god the lord does work in mysterious  ways doesn't he larry well yes he does he's a good god good god almighty no he is a good and  gracious god sam and worthy of our praise yeah yeah i guess but that's not but i'm going to tell  you something i'm on the side of a mexican highway and nobody there's no god that's getting my praise 
[03:29:30]  not one well he would if you surrendered to his son and was washed in his blood problem is i don't see  that happening anytime soon well that's between you and god sam you work out your own salvation with fear  and travel now what about this larry it seemed do you think god's going to be uh upset with you  that you kind of have taken to me like it like a bit of a deity sam you're not a deity you're you're  a very talented broadcaster very insane i find your shows very funny i so much enjoy your shows 
[03:30:00]  you're always a bright spot when you're on with your opener and it always perks me up i listen intently  just for any glimpse of the great sam roberts any little snippet i get to hear through my radio  you're a mysterious man larry i appreciate the call sammy you'd be good i'll talk at you later  and erock erock yes larry legos legos there you go larry found the spin on it hey you're larry fan 
[03:30:30]  have you ever been to mexico yeah several times but like what do you keep yourself locked away in the  resorts no no you've been to mexico mexico yeah i've been around it's usually because of vacation  stops but i've been like to the pyramids and through the jungle tours and stuff like that i'm  so i've always been scared of mexico even before the cartel stuff yeah i was always just afraid that  i was going to lose my passport or something and be stuck in mexico the last time i went to mexico was 
[03:31:00]  was right near cancun like four years ago but before that it was you know in the 80s and 90s  i mean you heard us talking to troy when troy went to mexico about how he was like he wanted  to go jump on a moped and go from uh shack to shack looking for like authentic tacos and we're going  no dude yeah people get beheaded for looking for tacos when i left the airport going to the resort  there were military checkpoints on the highway and that's what you can't and who knows what's behind  that military what army is it well no it's the mexican government it wasn't the cartel but they were 
[03:31:30]  doing the checkpoints for anywhere that american citizens were going and traveling to these resorts  and is that what to make sure to make sure yeah that nobody was like on your uh shuttle bus or  whatever it was that was taking you there yeah but if the cartel wants to get through aren't they  just going to blow through the it was one main highway that took you to the side road that took  you into each resort terrified terrified maybe it's a bit jingoistic of me but terrified you survived 
[03:32:00]  mexico troy that's fine it was all right well i was in cozumel earlier this year and then i went  back to uh cancun you've been to mexico twice this year yep and and when i went down to how close did  you both times combined what's the closest you ever came to being beheaded the closest i didn't come  anywhere near close what's the closest so obviously you didn't get beheaded because i'm talking to you  but what's the closest uh i mean we've got mopeds in cozumel okay and we just started because i wanted 
[03:32:30]  to find some good taco spots you actually did that you said you were thinking about doing it but not  in cancun but i did find i did get tacos in uh cancun i did because i go down there i want good tacos  i want authentic right right you search around you know new york forum you're looking around soho for  authentic tacos guess what you're gonna find some pretty damn good ones in mexico i want to find a  mexican lady breastfeeding her 10 kids right and uh while she's making my tacos scooping some meat into 
[03:33:00]  a shelf for you yes i get you that's what i want so yeah so when i went down there we're on mopeds  we're cruising around it was fun you know but if you go into like the downtown part of cozumel  and it just you know it just kind of doesn't feel right you know like okay we should we like like  when you get downtown is when you start realizing i need to make sure my eyes are open in every  direction yeah and i'm kind of like ah it just doesn't this doesn't feel right i think i'm gonna  head back towards you know where i should be yeah and did you how long did you stay in that area  right we were there all day no i mean in the part where you were like oh just a couple minutes and 
[03:33:30]  then you were you knew yeah but i mean people like it's broad daylight first of all you know so but  the way jim talks about it it's like there are cartels invading resorts well i mean i don't i don't do  when we were down there a couple months ago man it seemed really safe it did yeah and there are  don't don't get it fucked up like people will they'll jack you but there was a guy that was  at our resort that got jacked did you hear about larry's friend what's that larry year larry calling  yeah yeah his friend got carjacked yeah and then they beheaded the guys who carjacked them but here's 
[03:34:00]  the deal like in the middle of the night don't leave the resort and they know how to prey on people  that are fucked up because these are all resort these resorts it's all you can drink so people are out of  their goddamn minds drunk and so people are just waiting for them to stumble out of the resort  and right full advantage of the situation yeah so what happened to the guy who got jacked in your  resort he just he uh he was at a club downtown in cancun and it was like it was a it wasn't a resort 
[03:34:30]  club uh the place that he went that's what i'm saying yeah he went to no he went to a uh like a nightclub  like a regular mexican nightclub right but they have like they have a downtown part that's caters  to tourists okay that you know it's not like the uh the cantina or the uh you know the the mexican  spots cantina from star wars no oh so yeah so he went down so he was he said he was just really drunk  and the taxi driver just pulled over and was like give me your money and get to get out the cab driver 
[03:35:00]  did yeah and left him out on the street yep see that's why when eric's like well they set up  checkpoints and blah blah i'm like you can't trust anybody down there no if the cab drivers are jacking  you but they but they you just you take advantage of those people that are so out of their minds drunk  everybody just kind of knows it's not even like this cabbie is necessarily a hardened criminal it's  just the way of life down there is okay yeah you know when somebody ends up in my car this is just  what happens if a sober guy was in his car he would just take him to where he was going yeah 
[03:35:30]  yeah and believe me when i tell you man people will fuck with you anywhere okay i was in berlin  you know people were cabbies were trying to fuck with us and taking us to trying to take us to  places that we didn't want to go and you literally have to just you know first of all i i don't get  fucked up when i'm riding around like that i don't feel comfortable doing that that's smart you have  to be like you have to be firm but at least i wasn't in berlin i was like no this is where we want  to go like don't fuck with me yeah see a lot of i mean people get fucked with you probably in new  york too i mean when a tourist gets into a cab the cab driver's going to go all the way around  the city the thing is nobody's going to stop that cab anywhere near the five boroughs and behead 
[03:36:00]  somebody right that's the only difference but but fucked up shit happens everywhere that fucked up  though i just feel like in mexico it seems like it happens with a lot more for the area for the  amount of land it is it seems to happen a lot more well because first of all their their government is  just completely corrupt right second of all they're so poor that they just see that they  just sniff out the you have to take advantage of these opportunities and third i mean these cartels  are so powerful yeah you know uh ivan in california hey i just want to talk about some stuff happened 
[03:36:30]  when i went down to mexico yeah first of all what larry said yeah the cartel members they don't like like  petty thieves though they'll kill them if they know they're stealing and is that because because  they're committing such high volume crime that they don't need the police fucking around with like  you know just fucking with tourists yeah yeah and you know the the the federal police that's the 
[03:37:00]  those they're they're pretty straight you know but the like the common cops if you do something you  just give them money and they'll let you go okay so the corrupt cops are the ones that are just  like you know the cops of that town the federales mean business yeah i understand yeah yeah but uh  yeah i went to mexico this uh winter and uh there's cartel checkpoints too they stopped us 
[03:37:30]  you know they just pretty much ask you what you're there's there's meaning wait meaning their government  checkpoints looking for the cartel or their cartel no cartel cartel like the cartel is setting up  checkpoints yeah yeah there was a case and stuff see that's frightening to me that like the same way  iraq saying well their government checkpoints looking for cartel members cartel members are setting  up their own checkpoints it's a whole thing going on down there you look if you go down there you go  you go stay at the fucking resort you stay you just you don't have to leave all those are all inclusive  they're an airport in the resort no but they thought there's a guy sitting there you have like a car 
[03:38:00]  service he's sitting there waiting for you it's like a 30-minute cab ride to your resort and you  just don't leave the resort they have the food they have alcohol there's no reason to go anywhere  ivan the cartels they fuck with tourists or they leave them alone you know tell you the truth if  you're white you probably will get they'll probably just take your money but uh you know i'm mexican i  was down there they just pretty much asked us what we're doing there and where we're going but uh 
[03:38:30]  there was this guy there all right so we were in the checkpoint right they just asked us what  we're there and stuff the guy took off running left his family behind they caught the guy and they  uh they they fucked them up yeah but especially being a coward and leaving his family yeah yeah now not  only are you getting caught like not only do they have you what you were trying to avoid but you're  also like a piece of shit from yeah you're a real piece of shit and you look like an asshole just running  because when a person runs you look like a dick and they probably have cars they'll just drive 
[03:39:00]  caught them there's no way you're out running the cartel no yeah no and it's like on rural roads  and stuff so i mean you have nowhere to go they were stupid for doing that yeah yeah that's  yeah yeah thanks ivan you know why dude i've been to the bahamas like you go to nassau nassau you  you get off the beaten path to nassau it's fucked up like yeah it is ghetto like right  fucking scary ghetto i've been to jamaica same shit man that's true i guess i've been i've uh 
[03:39:30]  i've done that too and you see like when you get off the resort you take the boat somewhere  and then it's the cab you can because you can see the streets as whatever cab is taking you  you can see if you went down this one street that one street that it takes you to whatever  the center of the island where it's kind of no man's land yeah like when i was just in nassau a  couple years ago and you know there's the main strip there with all the restaurants and and you know  stores and yeah i was just like oh let's just go see what's going on up here a couple blocks just  go look at the houses or whatever and it changes within two or three blocks because the cops are 
[03:40:00]  only really interested i would think especially in towns like that in making sure that the tourists  have a good time yeah and so the tourist areas are kept nice and well and every so all the budget  for the country goes into those tourist areas everybody else you guys just take care of yourself  govern yourselves out there i was just talking to one of my friends actually she said and she was  like 16 years old she went on a cruise she was down in nassau and these guys pulled up their car  next to her and her friend and they physically try to put them in the car physically tried to put 
[03:40:30]  the two girls in the car wow and they just started screaming and punching they took off and ran yeah  but i mean that's that that was in the bahamas right so that shit goes on everywhere dude i think  bermuda is okay we were in bermuda after i got married and i think i think bermuda is pretty cool  bermuda's fine yeah because bermuda is tiny and it's not like inland outland it's just this tiny  little island and they and bermuda's got money too well i don't think i don't think nassau is that 
[03:41:00]  big is it no it's not that big but it's also it doesn't have the money that bermuda has yeah bermuda  has a lot of money and i think that makes a huge difference you know what i mean that makes a huge  difference in in people there's actually british police over in bermuda because it's part of the uh  uh it's the british isles yeah yeah i mean everything's more expensive yeah but that's um  like that's a british virgin island but that's local police there's not actual british cops over  there there's a big difference i mean in the in bermuda they have like these weird pseudo 
[03:41:30]  bahamian slash british accents like it is really british influenced over there and like you know rich  people go there and live there you know um let me see ray ray in florida  yes uh not all the times that people get uh busted up is because they're uh you know purposely  intoxicated i had a house you didn't drink didn't smoke or anything like that she said she was going to  a phone party doesn't remember much of anything else this was in mexico yeah it was in mexico outside 
[03:42:00]  port of aierta but she was in the resort and the next thing she knows she said the police are  kicking open the door and there's marijuana all over the uh all over the the room the cops are  after they threw her and there was she said there was you know the bad jail and then they had a jail  for the the drangos so they put her there i think she was a kid up in michigan she was there for about  four months until she had a cough up that wealthy i think she coughed up about five to ten thousand 
[03:42:30]  dollars before they let her go she said they treated him pretty or treated her and her husband  pretty well but they kept him locked up for four months yeah four months she couldn't get out for  about four months until they paid the money they kept her solid she said everything was fine but  yeah because uh she actually sounded fine i would hope that if you get locked up in a mexican jail  you can find like five or ten grand quicker than four months yeah yeah times are tough but that's when  you start calling in every favor you take a cash advance on a credit card anything that's what 
[03:43:00]  they have to do but you know she wasn't exactly wealthy she cuts hair and but i was like where  the hell is your natalie but where the hell is she for you know for four months you could you know  wasn't there and then she comes back and so she's never seven foot back there again but poor lady she  had a kid up there and that you know and stuff like that i mean i would think that if you end up in  jail for four months that's going to sour your experience yeah yeah she's not going down  to two anytime soon but yeah you can get some messed up stuff but it's not always when uh  you know you're intoxicated i think they prey on that and well that's yeah that's the cops that 
[03:43:30]  troy was talking about that's probably the local cops that are you know or she sent her family and  the family thinks of spam mail like get out of here yeah i need help yeah but she said it wasn't like  they threw in a nasty jail it was nice she said they ate all right everything like that but it was more of a  you can't you don't get out until you get the money and it's got to be cash and it's crazy  thanks ray ray it sucked for her man yeah would you take uh four months in a mexican jail if they 
[03:44:00]  gave you like good food like it's authentic food take them four months to tell the story  i know all right right right we got it she was in jail it's authentic food like you like and you  get to hang out in mexico is it beachfront yeah but the window is not big but can i go relax on the  beach for a couple hours a day i guess you get an hour out of your cell right work out of my tan yeah you can  go tan a little bit maybe and then you call like gary and say bro i'm in jail what do you want me to  do i can't come in yeah take some flex days off bro i'm stuck what can i do scott in tampa 
[03:44:30]  hey how you doing today stan good hey uh i travel uh outside of the country quite a bit for business  and i've been going to mexico for 10 years and maybe had one or two problems what kind of problems  uh we got chased one time in rural mexico um what were you doing in rural mexico that's i don't  understand if you're there for business what business do you have in rural mexico uh that's  where they put a lot of the facilities a lot of the plants they put them outside of the main city 
[03:45:00]  like outside of mexico city you know a couple hours away so but i always have a mexican national that  travels with me down there so you've got a wife and kids he really doesn't get in too much trouble a lot  of that is self-induced yeah you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time but if you really want to  be scared be an american and go to venezuela is that the spot uh-huh dude i didn't make it out of  customs before i was accosted by three three guys who held me in a room with a dangling light bulb 
[03:45:30]  for like an hour and a half what were they trying to get out of you money i you know what they never  asked for money um they just they just kept they just kept messing with me you know asking me  questions you know in spanish and you know the the best way to get out of it is just you know  perquito you know no espanol and then and eventually they'll give up but uh that terrifies me i'd be  sitting in that chair shitting myself being like well if they want to they could just shoot me in the  face and that would be that yeah yeah yeah they dumped all of my clothes all of my laptop all of 
[03:46:00]  my tools on the ground and then told me i was free to go in perfect english and um the gentleman who was  waiting for me is uh with the venezuelan national and you know i asked him i said you know what was  the deal with that he goes oh you were an american they were just fucking with you well see that's that's  crazy because who knows how far they would take the fucking that's like what well what are you going  to do about it though you're in their country exactly and that's all it is hey give us a what's 
[03:46:30]  up bro what year did you say this was what year did this happen in scott this was last year wow okay  why and and they had a boy they were having a boycott at one of the customers that i was at  so uh chavez's uh uh red-shirted people were at the gate of this plant and the people in the plant  is uh uh were working for a privately owned company and they were arguing back and forth there was  like a thousand people and you know the the people that were with me from brazil and uh 
[03:47:00]  from uh venezuela they didn't think that there was anything wrong with that you know meanwhile i'm  nervous that's i you know i call my wife i say yeah today we're probably going to die you know it's  just you know yeah you don't know all right thanks scott appreciate it buddy yeah why are you asking  what year irak because i went to caracas in the early 90s and it was great but i guess it just got  really bad over the last 20 years yeah i don't know and it's a weird thing because you don't know  exactly like the time frame my parents lived in argentina uh in the early 80s and they were saying 
[03:47:30]  that because you know my dad was traveling a lot for work and they had to have a national that drove  them around everywhere because they knew you can't be white people driving around because you'll get  stopped by the police and the police are the ones that you're most scared of but that's when i mean  i'm sure it's different now that's when you had you know guys with machine guns on every corner  and everything i have that with lajara oh yeah yeah they drive into trucks full of guys with  like ak-47s you don't ever go back to mexico do you i haven't been back for a while but last time i  went my dad said don't even speak one word of english oh really yeah around the cops if not you have 
[03:48:00]  to have money pay them off and and that's it yeah when you're with mexican people they don't  fuck with you as much as just if you're just a group of white people i probably depending on where  you are assume you don't have any money well yeah i mean especially it's so it's weird because  it's like uh they see you with another mexican like a mexican's cool it's almost like they give  you like the past like no this one's cool don't fuck with them i mean the scary thing is like at  least when it's about money you know what it's about it's like okay well if i can just find enough  money i can get myself out of this situation but the scary stuff is like that guy talking about 
[03:48:30]  venezuela when they're just fucking with you yeah they're just trying to show you how much power that  they have how much power you don't have yeah that's terrifying of course i mean because what can you do  see that happens everywhere man anywhere you go there's that bullshit could happen anywhere i guess  so uh josh in arizona hey good morning boys how you doing what's up buddy hey uh i just wanted to  call in and uh i'm in yuma arizona which is right on the corner i could throw a handful of rocks in it 
[03:49:00]  10 mexican nationals don't do it they'll get so pissed right so i go down to mexico quite a bit  probably two three times a week to do business down there um i mean uh family's uh mexicali and  ticate tijuana area and um you know i've gotten lost down there made the wrong turn on the wrong  street you know end up in shantytown or end up you know in the hood where you just got to just  keep on going just blow through the stop sign and get as close to the border as possible because 
[03:49:30]  yeah some of those places are are kind of questionable and then you get to these military checkpoints and  those guys are there and you know they're just going all through your car asking you questions  that's about the scariest thing it's having to deal with the government down there it's so  bureaucratic but but you know uh you just like previous caller said you just gotta you know  pay attention to where you are and you know just you know try to get out of you know don't be in  bad situations don't put your don't put yourself in bad places you hear these stories about these  young kids going down there party and they go hey let's go to this bar it looks cool and it's a 
[03:50:00]  national bar there and you know you got all these guys there with the pointed cowboy boots and the  cowboy hats and yeah that's not the place where americans would be you know there's certain areas  where americans be and that's where they are like all right listen we can't have every word in the  dictionary in that one sentence i got it it's so dangerous excited to be on the air with you christ  almighty i guess it's exciting but i mean some of the long stories are interesting but he's just like  no moment for air in there yeah and basically i thought i felt like i was being you know i felt 
[03:50:30]  like i was one of the little interrogation rooms just now i mean do think about it like you have  somebody come out from middle of fucking whoever like you have a white guy regular white guy american  white guy walking around the right wrong parts of brooklyn fucked up in the middle of the night what  do you think's gonna happen true you know and that's that's part of it too is just being comfortable  with where you are i think that that's why people don't get fucked with because you know if a person's just  comfortable like i walk you know probably like four blocks every morning uh to work at like you 
[03:51:00]  know 4 30 in the morning and through times square and everything and it's not a horrible neighborhood  but i've never i've never really been fucked with i've been approached a couple times but i always look  like i know where i'm going i'm supposed to be here i'm not scared of what's going on but i'm  comfortable i'm just aware and so it's like okay if i say if somebody comes up to me and says yo yo yo  you got any money and i go no i'm i don't know sorry buddy that's okay that's it now to put three 
[03:51:30]  or four drunk college girls completely out of their minds in front of those same people what's going  to happen we've had interns that walk around here with their thumb up their ass and their eyes in the  sky and yeah they end up in trouble yeah you know so yeah i mean to be fearful of a certain place just  because you know there's some bad i mean there's bad that happens everywhere yeah i mean i guess if you  like if i were going to mexico i would just have to go directly to the resort and not leave those  walls and when you get to the resort it's it's lovely i bet it would be lovely yeah and make sure 
[03:52:00]  you tip them the people well so they won't turn you into the other cartel people i don't think  anybody at the resort is going to turn me into the cartel for a bad tip no but that seems a little  far-fetched you got like the jewelry in that though no forget that um brett in texas  sam hey what's up buddy hey bud we used to go down to i grew up in south texas and we went down  to the whorehouses all the time down there and as long as you knew how to behave you were fine did you  ever go to the whorehouses in mexico no you didn't you didn't make it out there not to the whorehouses  no not in mexico at least it's like going grocery shopping it was the shit but we thought we knew 
[03:52:30]  what we were doing and after this cartel ship broke out we thought hell they're not going to mess with  us you know they don't fuck with tourists but we went down to uh pedras eggers one night across  from uh eagle pass and we're in the whorehouse having our fun and all that and uh a bunch of  these guys dressed in black just they weren't from around there they weren't like everybody else in  there and are you the only two white guys in there uh pretty much but that wasn't that big of a deal 
[03:53:00]  because i mean as long as you know how to behave you know you're comfortable you're aware you know  what you know what's going on you know what the deal is yeah and don't be an asshole don't draw  attention to yourself but when these guys came in like the the locals down there got nervous  which made me real nervous and we were sitting drinking just kind of feeling it out and then  we noticed we were getting more and more looks and the girls were kind of staying away and luckily  sadly enough i've been in this whorehouse enough times enough the back door out 
[03:53:30]  and uh me and my buddy got up like we're going to the restroom and slipped out the  back door and we hightailed it for the river and we got across but good yeah because that's  a terrifying situation where you're like okay i know i'm in a bad spot but i also know if i just  stand up and walk out the front door right now it's only going to get worse yeah like well i'm  fine you can't you can't just act like you're scared you're dead you better be scared but you  need to be cool about it within that next week a few guys i heard in the paper got uh they got 
[03:54:00]  rolled down there pretty bad i don't know if any of them died but i know that they were they were  thumping on white boys pretty good down there for a while so is that the last uh  mexico strip club trip you went on yeah i would imagine unfortunately it's a hell of a lot of fun  but it just ain't worth it you ever go to mexican strip clubs rolling no you should get that nut off  you know what i mean church you could use it tom ford tom ford indeed matt in new jersey hey sam uh  when i was in active duty in the marine corps we used to go down to tijuana um like every other weekend 
[03:54:30]  when there was nothing going on and we used to go to a club called club mystery and it was ten  dollars to get in and all you can drink and everything else that you could want that was  legal and uh did you get the shits what's that did you get the shits i would imagine eventually  you know drinking a lot in mexico they're going to put those ice cubes in the drinks you're going  to end up with the shits troy got the shits yeah absolutely it's bad right yeah but um sometimes  we would get lost outside of the club and we'd actually get ushered in back to the club because  they would tell us it's safer uh in here than it is if you get lost out there i had a quick 
[03:55:00]  question for you dude if i was wondering if i could get your help to try and spread  um mental health awareness for today's struggling veterans if i could of course well um i actually  wrote a book about my experience in iraq and uh it's called the song each bullet sings it's available  on amazon my name is matthew craw america kind of forgets about uh what their veterans are dealing  with because they can't always relate with combat so i tried to make um my story uh more relatable  by by showing things like emotion like anxiety fear and love while i'm pulling the trigger to try 
[03:55:30]  and get america to understand a little bit more what their veterans are dealing with all right cool  check it out on amazon.com thank you man thanks sammy all right talk to you later you know what else  america tends to forget they tend to forget that your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle you know  what i mean like a lot of people don't realize that it doesn't need a back scratcher it doesn't  need 10 blades seriously have you noticed the price you pay for new razor blades how much is it  is that in pesos that kind of fits into our conversation doesn't it and you're doing this

[03:57:00]  to uh the to mexico probably about four five six times a year on business we go out of uh yuma we  actually drive down um we've gotten stopped a couple of times you're talking about there somebody  was talking about checkpoints and stuff and what we learned number one you've got to dress down  you don't act nervous even though you may be scared shitless you don't act nervous you just you know  we've got a mexican driver and stuff and the one thing that we learned that helps out big time when 
[03:57:30]  you come up to these checks checkpoints number one we always pay to get through  otherwise they're going to fuck with you and go through everything how much how much you have to  pay well we usually do a hundred dollars but what it is is you never give them a hundred dollar bill  you're always breaking down into tens or twenties because what they're going to do is pay everybody  there at the checkpoint so if you give them a hundred dollars then it you know it's it's kind of almost  a slap in the face of them you just give them you know a couple twenties or you know some tens and 
[03:58:00]  everything that way they can pay all their guys we actually have one time yeah we made it about four  miles past the checkpoint and got stopped by some guys just came in you know they're driving some  toyota pickups and jumped out in the middle of the road the guys from the checkpoint came down to  where we were at because they saw the dust and i mean lit these guys up i mean it was like you  you talk about the mexican standoff they told us to get the fuck out of there and we probably  not even a half mile down the road we started hearing gunfire yeah when people when people like 
[03:58:30]  that tell you to get the fuck out of there you generally oblige yeah yeah good tip buddy thank you  thank you for the advice this type of shit doesn't happen in montreal does it i hope not because  like you said it can happen anywhere i want i can't wait i'm going to go down to the red light  district in montreal is there a red light i think so yeah i see what's going on down there eric is  there a red light district in montreal yes that's the first thing roland brought up when we  decided we were going to go to montreal the red light district what's going on the dirty district  what does roland know about the sex district he needs to get a nut off more than anybody
