<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, engaging in a profanity-laced discussion about their own financial woes, specifically their experiences with agents and accountants, and the frustrations of navigating corporate finance.  They segued into a lengthy conversation about their past experiences with divorce, focusing heavily on Anthony's divorce, including the details of his underwhelming engagement ring purchased in Penn Station, his proposal, and his overall negative feelings about marriage and the legal ramifications. Opie added anecdotes about his friends' divorces, emphasizing the financial burdens often shouldered by men.  The conversation touched on their busy schedules (including playing EverQuest 2), fatigue, and cynical observations about marriage and post-marital behavior.

The show continued with a segment focused on the negative aspects of relationships and marriage, fueled by listener calls recounting harrowing divorce stories. Callers shared tales of infidelity, violence, self-harm, and even imprisonment of spouses for child sex offenses.  One caller detailed paying alimony decades after his divorce.  The segment included humorous anecdotes from callers, such as a trucker’s CB handle, a story about trying to eliminate a lingering smell after sex, and a listener's detailed account of cheating and the violent reaction from his wife.  A caller also described his ex-girlfriend replacing a diamond ring with cubic zirconia.  The hosts interspersed listener calls with their own commentary, frequently using explicit language and discussing infidelity, violence, and the etymology of the word "fuck".  Music, including a Nine Inch Nails/50 Cent mashup, played throughout.

Next, the show abruptly shifted to a discussion about a vulgarly described "surprise" involving a woman. This segued into a conversation about Laszlo, the audio producer for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and his humorous commercial for "Monster Rain."  This then led to a segment featuring audio from soldiers in Fallujah, detailing the brutal realities of combat and the emotional toll of war, including a specific incident involving the shooting of an apparently unarmed insurgent.  This sparked a discussion on the morality of warfare and the actions of soldiers in combat.  More listener calls followed, some featuring crude encounters and stories of prison life, including one caller who recounted his wedding and subsequent return to prison for escaping.  The segment included an audio clip of an intoxicated Anna Nicole Smith and a prank call from Double J involving a fake "ball cancer" diagnosis.

The show then featured Opie suggesting absurd and potentially disruptive pranks, followed by a commercial break for XM Satellite Radio and the Delphi Sky-Fi 2.  A Technophile segment discussed the privacy concerns surrounding RFID chips in US passports.  The hosts revisited a previous prank call where they told a child that Santa Claus wasn't real, generating a subsequent call from an upset listener whose young son, Jeffrey, had overheard.  The conversation then turned to a fight at the Vibe Awards reportedly involving Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, and a stabbing. Earl, a Black guest, contributed his perspective on the incident, racial stereotypes, and the violence at such events. A caller, Mike from Jersey, inquired about gun checks at the awards show.

The show then covered Sex Bagel's experience sneaking into the "Christmas with the Cranks" premiere, followed by a phone interview with Mick Foley.  Eric, an XM Radio employee, also recounted his experiences at the premiere, sharing encounters with Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd. The hosts discussed their negative interactions with various celebrities and publicists at the event, focusing on their perceived arrogance and uncooperativeness, highlighting Jamie Lee Curtis's anger and Dan Aykroyd's seemingly rehearsed responses.

The final segment included an interview with Tim Allen, alongside a simultaneous (and hampered) interview with Dan Aykroyd due to publicist interference.  The hosts and studio guests discussed the awkward situation.  This was followed by listener “Today I Learned” segments and the introduction of a bizarre invention: a Sawzall with a dildo attached. The hosts and guests discussed this item in graphic detail, using crude and sexually explicit language. The show concluded with more listener calls and closing remarks.

[00:00:30]  Love you, Opie, love you, Anthony  Boy, we're gonna have great fun  Love you, Ben, love you, Steve  I hope you brought a big bag of smiles  O-N-A, O-N-A  You two are going to hell  Shut up, kill yourself  Throw the third switch  Opie and L.A., the virus is spreading  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and takes  You little scumbag 
[00:01:00]  I got your name  I got your ass  You will keep your hands off of my mule  You're just a tool  Well, let me tell you something  My crunk, Mick, friend  You can act like a man  What's the matter with you?  I don't care how many  Dago, guinea, walk, greaseball, goombas 
[00:01:30]  Come out of the woodwork  Stay out the bushes  Smoke weed every day  Ah, yes  Hello  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  We like to call it the O-N-A virus spreading across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio  The show getting more gooder every fucking day  Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey  Watch out with that language  Whoa, whoa, a little harsh  Hey, hey, now 
[00:02:00]  I was just feeling it this morning  Could be families listening  You don't think so?  I don't think so  Off to school  How are you guys?  A little sleepy  Yeah, I'm a little sleepy today too  For whatever reason  Too many good games out  Coming out  I've been playing EverQuest 2, Opie  Fag Central is reporting in  I'm playing EverQuest 2  A lot of people don't understand that whole thing 
[00:02:30]  But I spent about maybe eight hours  Yesterday?  Oh my gosh  Aside from a quick break to meet with our financial guy  Yeah, what happened?  Oh, you know how psyched we are to leave here sometimes?  There are some days where we're kind of tired  Still getting used to the sleep thing  It's getting a little better though  Getting a little better  I'm kind of getting used to going to sleep early  Waking up early  But I don't know  After the weekend and stuff yesterday  A little groggy 
[00:03:00]  A little groggy  I was really looking forward to getting home  And just kind of kicking back  Relaxing a little bit  And I get a call from our finance guy  Yeah, I'm right up the road from you  Is it a left or a right?  I'm like, I forgot  I made an appointment with the guy  This is like the most boringest guy  No, I can't blow it off  Because he's like right there  He's there  And then it was just like an hour and a half  You know, insurance stuff  And finance stuff  And term life 
[00:03:30]  And this and that  Like stuff where  I mean  If we were hanging out at a strip club  After the show yesterday  I'd be nodding off  That's how tired I was  And then you gotta just deal with  And what does that mean?  What does all that mean?  What is it?  I don't know!  We're just radio guys  We don't need to know about anything else  I point at like a dollar amount  And go  That one good!  That one good!  Might as well just throw a dart at it  I have no idea  I just pretty much want to get the meeting over with 
[00:04:00]  As quickly as possible  We have an agent that's just trying to make us legit  And he just doesn't understand  It's never going to happen  Trying to set us up with all sorts of retirement plans  But it's all of his friends!  Yeah  Friends, family members  Friends, family, acquaintances  Everyone Bob refers us to  Is the best  What's with these words?  He just happens to know all of them too  Our agent got the bright idea of incorporating you and I  And now I know why  So he could feed his own family  That's right  We have like an accountant that lives in Chicago 
[00:04:30]  Hey!  Chicago who's somehow related to our agent  Then we  Well, you know, you're going to have to put a couple of more dollars into that fund  Right  That's what you got to do  Couple of more dollars  Because that'll come back and help you when you go to retire  What?  I don't know  I don't even know  Just give me the money, I'll put it in the bank  Is that what you do?  That's all we need  That sounds responsible  But he thought, no, very important to be incorporated  We write checks  And his reasoning was 
[00:05:00]  You'll save so much more money if you're incorporated, I guess  That's like the basics of this, right?  And the amount of checks we write for like people  We have, I think we have a staff of like 20 people  I get a bill sometimes  I have no idea what it's for  It's going out to Chicago somewhere  For some work he did  Yeah, some work he did  I don't know  Well, we had to pay the corporate payroll balance book secretary  And that'll cost you about two G's  What? 
[00:05:30]  What did she do?  Well, she took care of the corporate paycheck balance book  Okay  We pay people and we don't know what they do  I have no idea  I think we need to audit our agent  I really do, man  You want to do an audit?  We really need to know where this money's going  Wow, I want to have my turn up  What the freak is going on?  I do feel he is as honest as they come  But there's these little things  But he's still a lawyer and he's still an agent  Yeah  And he knows people  He can't be fully trusted no matter what you think 
[00:06:00]  He's got these acquaintances and family members that are on the payroll  On our payroll  On the till  In the till  The hand in the till  I write checks  I'm like  You're kidding me, right?  I don't know what it is  I know  I write the same ones  I sign them  I'm like  Okay  I'm like the stupid guy that ends up broke  How many times do you go like this?  You're writing the check  And you're like  What the fuck did she do this month for $2,200?  I don't know  And who the fuck is this?  Who's that? 
[00:06:30]  As I'm signing my name  What do they do?  What do they do?  I don't know  I have this fear that I'm just going to be that guy  And how many bank accounts do we have?  Who has no clue where his money went  How many bank accounts do we have?  I don't know  I'm not very sure  We have bank accounts hidden all over the place  Are they hidden?  I think they're hidden because I don't have a statement book  Do you check yours at all?  How do you check them?  Oh my god, dude  You can check it online  Which one? 
[00:07:00]  Like I pop into that thing about once a week  To make sure it's still there  Dude  We shouldn't have multiple bank accounts  Why?  Because what does that mean?  I want one bank account  There's your personal account  Right  There's your corporate account  Right  And then there's an Opie and Anthony account  Right  No, I know  Which we share  There's other ones  Oh, you ever get a divorce  I'm going down there first  And withdrawing all the money  I learned  Hope will be down there  I'd like to withdraw half the money 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Mr. Kumia came in  And took it  There's other bank accounts though  There's not much money in him  I don't know  I don't know  I have websites  I have websites  That I can go to  And check them  And that's what I do  Once a week  I check and make sure  It's still in there  Because I  And when I hit the enter button  I wince  I'm wincing  And looking at the monitor  I go  Come on, baby  Come on, be there  Because I'm waiting  To just see zero  Zero, zero, zero  Because it's happened before  In my marriage  So I'm just waiting  To see the zero balance there  And know that 
[00:08:00]  You know  After this is all said and done  I have to go back to construction  Right  So I guess we're doing okay  I don't even know  I have no idea  Yeah, I don't know  We just write these checks  So yesterday the finance guy  Came over  And I had to write another check  For insurance  Was he trying to entertain you  With his style of humor?  Oh, God  He's, yeah  You know  He gets into a couple of conversations  About things  Right  Sometimes political  Right  And you know  I'm just kind of  Talking and staring  At the paperwork 
[00:08:30]  We have to go over  And looking at his eyes  Glancing back at the paperwork  Like hello  See that thing  That I have to sign  At some point here  Perhaps we can do that now  Yeah, let's  Let's just sign the paperwork  So I can sign that now  So I can take a nap  I can leave  Don't want to hear  Your philosophy on the election  With the cute jokes  You heard around the office  Jesus  We don't do the cute jokes  No  Ever on this show  It is so  And it's  It's this  It's still connected  To the divorce thing  From years ago  Dude, how long ago 
[00:09:00]  Did I get divorced?  I think it was 1999  Three, four, five years ago  Five years ago  Things started  And I'm still dealing with it  Like I  I have to carry insurance  Now let me  I have to get my ex-wife  Insurance  So if I drop dead  She gets paid  Can you believe that?  And I got  There I was yesterday  Writing another check  It's painful  It's  It's amazing  Guys get  Screwed  Is there a certain amount of time 
[00:09:30]  You have to write checks for  In a divorce  Or is it like forever?  It's all negotiable  Ready for this?  Anthony  Can I say this?  You were married ten years  Yeah  And you will be paying  For more than ten years  Technically  When it's all said and done  Yeah  It seems like I got  Another seven years to go  Or something  How is that possible?  Seven years  Like  Oh  Just writing the checks  Hello  Hello  I sign her name  And it's still my last name  On there  It's so annoying  Can't you change that back? 
[00:10:00]  Why do ex-wives  Feel compelled to keep the name?  Some of them  Some of them don't  Because they can't do anything  On their own  Yep  Simple as that  Wants to make it easier  Like keep the name  Can't do anything on their own  And don't want to do anything  On their own  I guess  I know a little bit  Something about your ex  And she doesn't do anything  Except spend your money  That's all she does  That's it  She hasn't done anything  To better herself  Because she's living off  Your dollar  Well  What are you going to do? 
[00:10:30]  Well all women  Like hitting the lottery  Wouldn't all women  Be ashamed to just take a check  For doing nothing?  I mean any woman  Who knew marrying me  Was hitting the lottery?  Who saw that one coming?  Who saw it?  I did  I did  You saw that one coming?  Man  When I was knocking tin  Up in an attic  Can you imagine?  Who knew the investment  In time  Would really pay off  You know?  Yeah that's pretty wild  There I was  Making my  27,500 bucks a year 
[00:11:00]  In attics  And now she gets paid  For a decade  Because she was married to you  I thought I won the lotto  Because she was a bartender  I got free drinks  To me that was winning the lotto  Wrong  I'd get done with work  Hop down to the bar  In Green Lawn  And just start chugging  Beers and shots  That was lotto to me  You mean I don't  You mean I don't have to pay  For booze ever again?  This is fantastic  Oh you're going to be paying  For that booze my friend  Oh are you going to pay? 
[00:11:30]  Those free shots  Are about a thousand bucks a piece  Yeah why don't you do  The new math now  And figure out  How much those shots  Actually cost you  I'm going to do the new math  I bet you  If someone out there  Was handy  With a calculator  And a pen  And we gave them  A few figures  I think those same shots  You did for free  Way back in the day  Would cost you  About a thousand dollars  Per shot now  I don't even need  A calculator  I can round it off  And pretty much figure  It comes out to a lot  A lot  It comes out to a lot of cash  Guys just get reamed man 
[00:12:00]  And you know something  I'm just thankful  I do have something  You know  Because if I was just some guy  That's working for a living  Yeah  And you know  You're still paying  Through the nose  Yeah  That's got to hurt  Well you know  At this point  I don't  I still got the roof  Over my head  And you know  Food  At this point  I don't even understand  Why people get married  I don't  I could never  Do it again  I don't think  I'll ever get married  At this point  I don't know  I did it the first time  I had a shot at it  And it failed miserably 
[00:12:30]  Obviously  But I don't  I don't think  It's just not worth it  Because you're  You're putting  You're putting  Too much trust  In the whole damn process  You could be in  You know  Complete love  With somebody  And  The worst thing  You can do  Is get married  Why have the paperwork  Why have the legal  Binding contract  That all it can do  All it can ever do  Is bite you in the ass  Right  That's all it is  It's all it can do  If you're in love 
[00:13:00]  With each other  And you're living together  Or you know  Sharing your life together  That's fine  All good could come from that  What's the paperwork for  Why do you need  This friggin document  That will turn around  And cost you  Money and pain  Right  Down the road  And no reason for it  And in most cases  The guy gets screwed  Obviously  I mean  When we talk about divorce  You'll get a few  A few guys call  And say  No I actually 
[00:13:30]  Made out in my divorce  Oh you get ladies  That call up and say  It was horrible  I got screwed  I was the one  That bought the house  Right  Exception to the rule  Ladies  But in general  It's  Let's be honest  The guys get screwed  So you're getting married  Just to throw this contract  In a drawer somewhere  Where someday  It's going to haunt you  And a lot of guys  End up staying in a marriage  Because they know  They're going to get screwed  If they try to get out of it  So then they have to  Live and be miserable  Yep  Knowing that they really  Want to get out of the marriage  But they just can't afford  To do it  Ben's smiling 
[00:14:00]  He was just telling me  The other day  About some of his friends  That are just getting screwed  His friends got married  And just  It's the typical story  You just change their names  It's awful  We had a guy  A sales guy  At WNEW  Who was making  A really good living  Really good living  But he got divorced  And his wife got everything  Like a really nice house  In Westchester  Oh you get out of the house  And you know  He had to take care  Of the children as well  Which he had no problem with  When it was all said and done 
[00:14:30]  He was living in a little box  Here in Manhattan  Yep  Still making a ton of money  For WNEW  But it was all going to his ex  The only thing he could afford  Was like a tiny  One bedroom apartment  It's got to be great  For a man  To get married  Work his ass off  Buy that dream house  For him and his bride  And for whatever reasons  Guys or girls  Could be their fault  Either one  Whatever  I'm not even getting into that  But whatever the reason is 
[00:15:00]  There  He has to move out  Get some shithole apartment somewhere  As his ex  Now lives in the house  That his sweat  And blood  Bought  As she's you know  Maybe now  Banging some guy  In his bedroom  That he bought  And paid for  It's just  There's  There's no reason  Yeah so why would you do that  Why would you do that  I just  It doesn't make sense anymore  There probably was a time  It really made a lot of sense  Until the lawyers got their 
[00:15:30]  You know  There are greasy hands involved  In this whole process  You know  There should be no reason  You're just  Taking way too much for granted  You're just assuming  That you're going to be  In a really happy  Loving relationship  For the rest of your life  And in most cases  That's not going to be  The case  So you're signing  You're signing away your life  As you know it  This was  From the older days  When women  Were incapable  Of taking care of themselves  In the world  What they did  Was they hooked up  With a strong man  Who worked 
[00:16:00]  And she raised the family  And if something  Happened to the guy  And he wasn't insured  Or they got a divorce  The woman was pretty much  Left out in the cold  So all kinds of laws  Were made  And divorce law was made  And now the women  Have to be supported  By the guy  But it's 2004 now  People  And we're still living  With this system  That you know  The woman can go out  And support herself  As a human being 
[00:16:30]  You don't need the guy  Paying for  For you to live now  But  Still happens  What about the guy  He's got to work  And support himself  That's not easy  99% of the people  Out there  Aren't you know  Earning enough  That they could pay  For two people separately  And there he is  Buying a little  Or renting a little  Shithole  As the woman  Gets the house  The cars  You know  You got to sell everything  Anything fun  You might have had  In your life  That boat that you had 
[00:17:00]  The motorcycle  That all has to get sold  It's a disgrace  It's awful  Why would you do it  Why  If you're getting married  There are some guys  Right now listening  Going  Oh my god  That have a wedding  Right around the corner  Right around the corner  And right now  Cancel your wedding  Cancel it  Cancel it  I mean in the end  You're going to lose  Simple as that  If you're truly in love  70%  And trust me  God will understand  Yeah  If you're getting married  Because of the whole  You know  You have to be married  In God's eyes  Or whatever  He'll understand 
[00:17:30]  In the end  I'll tell you why  People get married  Especially guys  It's because of  Their families  They're getting married  For their families  That's one reason  For the girl  That's another reason  It's her day  A lot of guys  Don't want to get married  They get pushed into it  Guys would rather  Live with the girl  And that's it  Send it right there  Girls want to get married  And the families  Want their children  To be married  And that's why  People do it  When you're walking  Down that aisle  When you're ready  To give those vows 
[00:18:00]  You're not thinking  This is great  You're thinking  Holy shit  What the hell  Is going on  I'm signing a legal  Binding document  That can only hurt me  In the end  And most weddings  Just stink  Let's be honest  They stink  With that whole  Tradition  You know  You pick out a reading  You don't even know  What it is  You just know  It sounds good  And you'll  Oh that stupid  Letter to the  Corinthians thing  Some  Some sap  Gets up  And starts reading it  Half those readings 
[00:18:30]  What  You don't mean this  You just picked it  From a book  Just so your aunt  Could start crying  In the front row  And I love  That will last forever  And  Shut up  She's up at the podium  Shaking  Shaking nervous  Reading hands  And you're sitting  There looking  At your watch  You shouldn't  Look at your watch  If this is an event  People put on  Taking years to plan  But everyone's  Looking at their watch  Because it's just  Boring as hell  It's the same crap  You've been through  A thousand times 
[00:19:00]  Oh here they come  They're lighting  The candles together  Oh look at them  Light the candles  Take some pictures  Of that  Right  So we can tear them  In half  When they get the divorce  Here's something  For the people  Getting married out there  Most people  Don't want to go  To your wedding  Right  They have no  Fucking desire  To go to your wedding  You've been friends  With them forever  Yes I understand that  They don't want to be there  They bitch the whole time  To other people  Going  Oh man  Saturday  It's a long weekend  And I have to go  To blah blah's wedding 
[00:19:30]  I know I've been friends  With them since childhood  But I don't want to  Freaking go  I'd rather play golf  I'd rather do this  I'd rather do anything  But  How many times  Do you say that  I've got a wedding  To go to  Another wedding  And then you go  I'm at the point now  In my life  If I get invited  To a wedding  It's got to be  Somebody really  Like close to me  And I don't go  To the church  I refuse  I show up  At the reception  Give me a couple  Of drinks  I'll come  A couple of drinks  Hang out  I'll goof on  The people  And then I'm out 
[00:20:00]  Will you ever see me  On the conga line  That goes through  The kitchen  Of the reception hall  Look at them  They're doing the conga  There they go  Oh look  Grandma's at the end  Oh what a  What a mess  It's nothing spontaneous  It's the same wedding  Nothing fun  It's this cookie cutter  Stamped out thing  With just new victims  New future courtroom victims  Sitting up  Cling cling cling cling cling cling 
[00:20:30]  Oh look  They're kissing  Same music played  The same dopey DJ  Daddy's little girl  Alright we get it  Daddy's little girl  Oh everyone's crying  Now if we could get  Everyone up to dance  No  I will not entertain you  Ladies and gentlemen  For the first time  Let's hear it  For Mr. and Mrs. Blech  Oh look  The bridal party's  Holding their arms up  To make a little tunnel  Here they come  Running through  Get the picture  The photographer 
[00:21:00]  Is taking all the pictures  We want to get the bridal party  Outside on the grass  It's a beautiful day  Now guys  Could you roll your pant leg up  And kick  What the fuck is that  What is that shot  And here's something else  Don't waste your time  On getting the pictures done  Because  You'll never look at them  You'll never look at them  You'll look at them  You know once  And then you'll throw them  In a drawer  No one wants to see them  No one wants to see them  And you see the happy couple 
[00:21:30]  That just got married  Give them  Maybe a year  And then they're going to be  Just as miserable  As all the other couples  You know  Right  Looking on at the wedding  Because they're together  No  Because they're married  Because they're married  I think  As soon as you get married  I don't know  Because I haven't done it  And that I  I'll give you any info  You want on it  And at this point  I just don't see the point  At all  There's no upside  I think that  If you're not married  You keep the excitement going 
[00:22:00]  You do  I think so  You absolutely do  Because I think  There's always that thing  Like you're not really  You know  The person  Excuse me  The person can leave  The relationship  At any given time  So it makes you work  A little harder  Danger factor  Makes you work a little harder  Maybe you won't cut your hair  And start looking like  Your buddy Phil all of a sudden  Maybe you won't gain  Those 15 pounds  Just because  Ha  We're married now  It don't matter anymore  Do you think  Maybe you know  Maybe you'll  You'll close the door  Instead of taking a shit  In front of your husband  It's just over 
[00:22:30]  At that point  Right  But if you're still  Living with someone  I think the excitement  Is still there  And you got that  In the back of your head  They can leave  They can leave at any time  Do you think  That bull dyke haircut  Is attractive  And hey  Ladies  Of course  Of course  There are  Millions of instances  That girls could give  Of their guys  Getting out of shape  And ridiculous  Oh and you know what  It's fair to say  It works both ways  Is what I'm saying  Right  You know  You live with a girl

[00:24:30]  Had better  Be cut  Look  Dude  There are  These women  That you see  On the Long  Island Railroad  Go on the matinees  They're more  They're more manly  Than a lot  Than a lot of men  I've seen  I don't know  What happened  There's like  Some kind of  Hormone  Hormones  Has happened  Already  There's something  Going on  Where they are  Getting these  Huge doses  Of male hormones  Because yeah  Their bodies  Take on a  Masculine shape  They're very  Wide at the 
[00:25:00]  Shoulders  Narrower at the  Hips  And they  Cover it up  With those  Sweatshirt  Things  And then their  Hair  They cut it  They get the  Phil hairdo  Phil hair  Phil  The Phil haircut  And their  I don't know  Their faces  And skin  Have this more  Manly look  To it  They've just  Given up  Could be all  The smoking  They're doing  Smoking  Just drying  Out their  Faces  They just  Give up  I used to 
[00:25:30]  Take that  Train  Because when  We were doing  Afternoon drive  And I'm like  I was horrified  It's like  This is  Is this the  Future  This is  Is this the  Train to the  Future  This is what's  Going to happen  But if you're  Not married  And there's that  Out  Like Opie said  Both sides  Work a little  Harder  I think so  Both sides  Work a little  Harder  To keep  Things going  They're not  Bound in a  Legal  Binding  Corporate  Relationship  My dream  Was always  To kind of 
[00:26:00]  Have a  Rockstar  Like  Relationship  Settle  What is that  Completely  Settle  Rod Stewart  Drinking out  Of  The  Jagger's  Mule  Until he's  Got to get  His stomach  Pumped  Settle  With someone  Know  Within  Both parties  Hearts  That  You're not  Going anywhere  But you don't  Have to make  It official  Right  I think that's  A hell of a lot  More exciting  Than doing the  Cookie cutter  Wedding in front  Of your stupid  Family and  Friends  I got married  At a bar  I didn't even 
[00:26:30]  Do the whole  Wedding thing  I got married  At the bar  That my mother  Worked at  That was pretty  Much  No one was  Affording anything  And you know  What it is now  It's a strip club  Is it really  The place I got  Married  Is now a strip club  In Comac  On Comac  New York  Out on Long Island  That's it  Speaks volumes  And I actually  Went to  Bill Brady  Habil  Cowbell Bill  Went to his  Bachelor party  At that very  Strip club  Really  The place you  Got married at  My wedding 
[00:27:00]  Place  I was shoving  Dollar bills  Down Russian chicks  G-strings  That's so cool  You had a horrific  Wedding I believe  Oh the wedding  The marriage  Everything  It was just a nightmare  I didn't know  What I was doing  The engagement ring  The engagement ring  One of my favorite  Stories ever  I should have  Known then  I mean it all  Adds up now  In hindsight  It all adds up  I for some reason 
[00:27:30]  Decided it was  Time for me  To get married  I think  Because my life  Was kind of  Not going anywhere  I thought that  Might have been  A direction to go  To kind of  Hook things up  Would have  Started the ball  Rolling  Wait yeah  Why would you  Get married  I had a shit  Job  Right  I lived in a  I lived in a  Hovel  I lived in a  Hovel  I gave you  My best to  Jerry  My spot  My spot  Online  Yeah  You know  Why don't you  Give me that  DVD back 
[00:28:00]  You're not  Getting your  King of Comedy  DVD back  I'm sorry  Alright go ahead  So I thought  I guess  I'm not even  Sure  It's a  Psychobabble  To me  But I  I guess  I thought  If I  Had gotten  Married  That it would  Push me  In a direction  I had to be  Which was  A little more  Responsible  Maybe I'd  Get a better  Job  Because of  It  Maybe a  Little more  Respect  I don't  Know  I just  Thought  I thought  It was  What I 
[00:28:30]  Should do  Apparently  I was  Wrong  Thought it  Was what  I should  Do  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  So I  Decide  I'm gonna  Get married  So I  What do  You do  When you  Get married  You get  A ring  Were you  Into it  Ever  Let me  Seriously  Assess this  No  I really  Wasn't into  It  I really  Wasn't into  It  Did you  Like do  It  Because you  Felt like  I don't know  Everyone else  Was getting  Married  No one  Else was  Really getting 
[00:29:00]  Married  So why  Did you  Get married  If you  Really  Like I  Said I  Thought it  Was one  Of those  Things I  Should do  I had  Reached  A point  In my  Life  Where it  Was like  Oh my  God  I'm  Just  I'm  Acting  Like this  Irresponsible  Kid  For my  Whole  Life  And  Boy that  Didn't  Stop  Did it  Thank God  Never  Stop  And I  Thought if  I got  Married  It would  Be a  Way  That I  Would  Go to  The next  Level  Where I  Would  Get  You get  Married  And then I  Would get  The good  Paying  Job  And then I  Would get

[00:44:00]  Northport  and go to  the justice  of the  peace  and then  it was  it  then it's  like holy  shit  I'm  married  and when  did you  realize  you  I already  know the  answer  made a  mistake  yeah  the night  the night  of the  wedding  see the story  never changes  I'm always  testing  oh the  night of  the wedding  the night  of the  wedding  you knew  you made  a mistake  and then  ten years  later  you finally  got out  yeah  oh my  god  ten years  I hung in  there for  ten years  nine  nine and  change  I don't know  why  why would I 
[00:44:30]  do that  why would I  torture myself  but I did  I hung in  there  thinking  ah  maybe the  better jobs  around the  corner  and you  know  something  it was  the better  job was  around the  corner  maybe my  plan was  working  I had  gotten  married  and then  I guess  five years  four years  four and a half  five years  later  I got the  better job  I was  going off  back to  up to  Massachusetts  to do  radio 
[00:45:00]  what a  coincidence  and what a  convenience  Opie  thank you so  much that our  first gig was  a mile away  from my  mother-in-law's  house  could have  been  anywhere in  the United  States  is it safe  to assume  that the  Opie and  Anthony  show  in its  birth  in its  birth  would have  gone  anywhere in  the country  had we  gotten a  good offer  yeah if  you remember  from New  York to  LA  from Montana 
[00:45:30]  to Texas  we would  have gone  anywhere  to start  the show  if you  remember  I don't  think we've  ever talked  about this  on the air  but when  we were  working at  BAB  and I  started  sending out  tapes  when you  and I  started  working  together  we were  getting  hit  people  were  interested  all over  the  country  right  away  which  is  crazy  I'm  going to  bring  in our  first  show  someday  and that  Dallas  wanted us  really bad  Dallas  could have  been  Dallas  it was  between  Dallas  and the  end  it was  between  Dallas  and  Worcester 
[00:46:00]  could have  been  Worcester  slash  Boston  let's say  anywhere  from  Spokane  Washington  to  Miami  Bangor  Maine  to San  Diego  anywhere  in between  we could  have ended  up  right  I'm a  mile  away  from my  mother-in-law  yeah the  radio station  was a mile  away  a mile  away  how did  that  happen  it was  the better  offer  and there  I found  myself  in my  Dodge  Aries  K car  oh yeah  I was  stepping up  I'd gotten  rid of the  bug 
[00:46:30]  I got a  Dodge  Aries  K car  driving  back up  that was  on blocks  when I  first came  to your  crib  yeah  yeah  your awful  crib  yeah  I remember  turning on  the air  conditioner  once  and white  smoke  came out  I was in  a James  Bond  movie  so you  realized  that you  made a  mistake  the night  of the  wedding  yeah  there you  are on  your wedding  night  which is  supposed to  be a  night full  of romance  right  well  hardcore  sex  night full  of romance 
[00:47:00]  hardcore  sex  oh yeah  sure  those cute  little panties  that the  women get  at their  bachelorette  party  and all that  yeah  those are  just torn  off  and then  you get  down to  just bumping  uglies  well  sometimes  it doesn't  work out  that way  sometimes  it works  out where  maybe  there  was a  little  too  much  partaking  in some  alcoholic  beverages  and  maybe  somebody's  maybe  somebody's  not in  any condition  to get a  little romantic  and maybe  the other  person's  laying back 
[00:47:30]  staring at  the ceiling  thinking  oh my  god  what have  I done  oh my  god  what have  I done  yeah  so why  didn't you  get out  at that  point  because  it wasn't  like you  were going  to lose  a lot  of money  I don't  know  that was  not part  of the  plan  and you  told me  once  like  you were  staring  at the  ceiling  and  dare I  say  there was  a little  tear  in your  eye  Anthony  a little  tear  in your  eye  rolling  down  going  oh my  god  what  have  I  done  yeah  yeah  it was  that is  just

[01:12:00]  because she was trying to kill herself i had to get her in my truck so did they believe you in the  end your story yeah they believed me in the end because my fingerprints weren't on the knife or  anything right and she didn't end up being able to kill herself they said i saved her life  you should never be in a situation where you have to say my fingerprints weren't on the knife  i know well i agree but you know who thinks who's gonna learn this is what i'm talking about you  know he probably got married it was a nice ceremony they had the first dance what was your song at

[01:13:30]  her wrist with a butcher's knife and he had a tire up and drag her to the hospital all bloody oh it was  horrible but it started like this anthony oh by the way i hit the post but yeah that's all i had  oh they're they're just gazing lovingly into each other's eyes mom and dad oh look they're oh they're  smiling i do believe dad's crying a little bit that well it's a very very tender moment right now and it

[01:14:30]  business sunglasses on we're gonna have some fun oh remember it ends with her hacking at her wrist  and him tying her up yeah taking to the hospital and being beaten down by security right because  he wanted out of that relationship but it started off nice let's look how it starts out opie there it  is yeah although the the the the whole bridal part is looking on they're ready because any minute now  the announcement is going to come up why doesn't everybody join them on the dance floor everybody on  their first dance together oh look here somebody's helping up uh helping the grandma up oh isn't that 
[01:15:00]  cute but it ends with her hacking at a wrist look he's a little he's a little awkward dancing and they  both laugh at each other because it's a little uncomfortable there's the photographer moving in  to get that special shot at that's good yeah and then later a photographer will come in and  photograph her wounds right for the court case did she have blood all over her face sir not on like 
[01:15:30]  the cake you smeared on there in happier times you dummy fast forward here comes csi oh my god man  all right tim thank you there was there was uh there was the part where he was actually what slipping the  uh the garter does he do that who puts the garter on the bride's leg she does i guess doesn't he take  it off she yeah i think the best man takes it off and then you someone throws it over their shoulder  right and catches it catches it puts it on uh the girl that catches yeah bouquet but there's something 
[01:16:00]  else going around her ankle today it's a rope to keep her from kicking at him speaking of the garter  coming off do you think at mccartney's wedding he pulled it off or she just sneezed and it fell right  off lost boy is back lost boy lost boy he's not back you're kidding you know what he's just still  lost he's still lost all right well all right let me see uh uh jamie and kc oh and a jimmy are you uh 
[01:16:30]  are you still married what's up are you are you still married no no actually i just wanted to let  you guys know where the word fuck come from all right go ahead all right back in medieval time  if a couple wanted to get married they'd have to go up to the king and get consent before they got  married or have the union and uh if he consented to it they would hang a sign f-u-c-k above their house 
[01:17:00]  and uh it would say uh fornication under consent of king of course the king got a little you know  he got first piece of ass if you like but that's where the word fuck originated i don't know if  that's accurate i've heard that before but i've also heard it was a charge against prostitutions  and the charge that they would the legal charge was for unlawful carnal knowledge which is the actual  legal charge uh for selling sex and that's where that slang came from so i've heard fornicating under the  the consent of the kings but it's not fuck because there's a thought in there so i don't think that's 
[01:17:30]  very accurate well hey that that's just what i pulled out the internet in high school right yeah  the internet's full of real facts thank you jamie yeah yeah i've heard that too all right it's it's not  though speaking of which let's listen to this really fast  perhaps one of the most interesting words in the english language today is the word  fuck out of all of the english words that begin with the letter f 
[01:18:00]  fuck is the only word that is referred to as the f word it's the one magical word just by its sound can  describe pain pleasure hate and love fuck as most words in the english language is derived from german the  word flicken which means to strike in english fuck falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive  verb for instance john fucked surely as an intransitive verb surely fucks its meaning is not always sexual 
[01:18:30]  it can be used as an adjective such as john's doing all the fucking work as part of an adverb  surely talks too fucking much as an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is fucking beautiful as a noun  i don't give a fuck as part of a word abso-fucking-lutely or in-fucking-credible and as almost every word in a 
[01:19:00]  sentence fuck the fucking fuckers as you must realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of  fuck as in these examples describing situations such as fraud i got fucked at the used car lot  dismay oh fuck it trouble i guess i'm really fucked now aggression don't fuck with me buddy difficulty  i don't understand this fucking question inquiry who the fuck was that dissatisfaction i don't like what

[01:26:00]  20 years they've been divorced for 28 years years later the guy's still paying so i guess not only  that he's gonna pay more now and he's on a fixed income he's gonna die soon now why would a court uh  give her money for longer than they were even married because the judge doesn't give a shit about men  all they care because he worked and he made all the money she made no money therefore she has to be  she has to be kept in the premarital uh living and they wonder they wonder why this old guy should 
[01:26:30]  just go in and choke her to death just incompetent incompetent whores  yep that's so had a job disgusting still unemployed still lives off that money wow  never had a job in her entire life and never will now all right they want independence and  and i mean they have independence but they want all this you know march on washington keep your laws off  my body yeah but boy as soon as a relationship's over they dig those greedy click diddlers into a 
[01:27:00]  wallet and take whatever they can get i can't work yeah thank you tim all right the phones have  exploded let's say hi to chris and rochester chris before you tell your story do you know the uh  the the the song that the couple danced to at their wedding  no i wasn't i didn't know the couple oh jesus all right go ahead during the 70s good one i thought  this was pretty clever the uh guy was getting divorced and he decided he didn't want his wife 
[01:27:30]  to have the house and the car so uh he torched the house and the car oh burned him up well the  the clever part was he canceled the insurance on the house and the car  so the cops couldn't charge him with anything yeah it wouldn't be an insurance scam well you  could still get arson yeah it's still arson then i don't think you're allowed to he was never  arrested for the crime what happened he was going for a test uh to be like an air marshal and they  said shoot the hostage great story oh my god does this guy bring up a thank you chris yeah i don't 
[01:28:00]  know if i'm buying that story because i mean you would still get arrested for something i was  talking about that chicken utica that i had this thought i should maybe uh you'd post to yeah in  the summer way back in the day yeah tool bag from new orleans instead of placing a ring on the utica  girl's finger opie drove off with his own stinking finger out the window oh oh that's actually the  same girl the guy no way yeah good thing you didn't marry her i thought every girl smelled awful down 
[01:28:30]  there because there's one girl you were driving back to new york and you know that's a true story with your  finger out the window dude i finger banged my my girlfriend right before thanksgiving break and  then i had to drive home to uh hot i had to drive you're you're a hopeless romantic yeah i finger  banged her so you finger banged old banged old mary jane rottencrest her pretty pink panties  um it was before thanksgiving break i was going to school in uh geneseo had my little honda and i had 
[01:29:00]  to drive home for the holidays and uh i couldn't figure out what the smell was and i showered and washed my  hands and stuff but it was so bad getting a little waft oh yeah it was so bad that i couldn't get it  i couldn't get the smell off my hands so i literally opened opened up the window and drove  most of the way with my hand hanging out the window to air it out it was awful and i and because of  that i thought all girls you know was it the first girl you would you know been with her no not really  but it was the first one i was really serious with so i don't know like i i would think if you had a 
[01:29:30]  previous you're right you're right it didn't smell like you're right but this one just kind of was it  poor hygiene or just some kind of chemical i don't know what it was i haven't smelled it since it was  absolutely awful and i thought every girl smelled like that so so the officer wasn't known for uh  going down for a really long time because i was just too scared oh boy and then i realized okay it  was just her thank god and now my bad breath is uh cured but she was the one you were thinking 
[01:30:00]  about yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh it was uh it was the worst the worst smell ever we got the profile of  the truck driver who's uh wow she's pretty hot wife is in prison she's 25 she's white female blue eyes  red hair red auburn hair five two hundred twenty uh and she's smiling she's all happy that she's in  jail happy wow that's something and she likes young girls and she likes very young girls does it

[01:31:00]  sodomy in the second degree yeah why sodomy i think she played down to that because they were giving  each other a head you know girls can't have intercourse and sodomy is anything that's not  intercourse in kentucky i got blood rushing in my mule right now that is so hot and she doesn't look a day  over 14 actually that's where she's 120 she's 102 102 okay in kentucky they do not allow uh  yeah they're all mouth to a vag do they when is she getting out sir march yeah march she's got

[01:34:00]  know good girl and everything but i missed the first part of your show and uh apparently you guys  were given some uh rationale on why not to get married you're 26 and you've been with a girl for  10 years yeah high school sweetheart that kind of danger warning warning you ever been with another  girl oh yeah couple of them before you were 16 or like yeah yeah i've been around the block what's  your question dominic the question the question is is uh well it's actually not a question it's more 
[01:34:30]  like uh advice what do you guys think why why did we decide that dominic needs to be on our radio show  today who's gonna read yeah this isn't this isn't uh wait who decided that dominic needs to be on the  show today you guys dominic stinks i'll say he does oh poor dominic he's he's going through a tough  time basically refer back to the first hour of the show is what he wants he wanted a recap we already 
[01:35:00]  did a whole hour now you guys put dominic on because he missed the first hour and he needs advice  which we gave uh during the six o'clock hour who put dominic on the phone i think i've won some  answers from one of the interns out there huh dominic stinks finger pointing going on in the  booth finger pointing hot young men pointing at each other dominic yeah what's up guys you're awful  you call up for a recap all right here here's uh i forgot his name danny danny sorry danny danny well 
[01:35:30]  when he called i said well didn't you listen to the first hour and a half of the show and he said  well i just woke up i'm like and i wasn't gonna put him through he's like he's like but i just got  engaged maybe they could talk me out of it danny yeah it's my time in the barrel i suppose well  norton has opened up one of his books so i don't know oh it's really up to norton and dominic is hung  up which he should have done thank you dominic sorry um i don't know if i'm gonna make danny read 
[01:36:00]  actually i don't know if i'm gonna make him read no no open is already reading at one point he uh  what oh you have to read no oh you do for what gee i don't know does anybody remember 12 uh being  divided from 27 500 times three yeah the math is a little off because he said you said a third of  the salary it doesn't matter what he said you were you was a third it was a third i i got the number  right if it was a third a third of your salary is a quarter of your yearly no but i gave the correct 
[01:36:30]  figure and he was very very demeaning about the correct figure and uh so i think that you you  definitely have a third of 27 000 is 9 000 you're right no it's three months salary did you say  we got that did you say three months salary or a third of i said three months salary and then it  was bastardized into being a third somehow through no fault of mine as if a year only has nine months  yeah we're all living on jupiter i think it would have been funnier if it was um mars 
[01:37:00]  why venus well jupiter actually rotates once every 10 hours i don't think any of them would  have been funny i just think jupiter is a funnier word i think venus might have the nine does it rotate  every 10 hours yes it does that's very crushing gravity is it 10 hours though yes it's a thousand  times the size of our planet sure positive i'm gonna go to discovery.com around the sun is what  uh oh i know i'm just the year you know that yeah it didn't matter for jupiter it would  oh it didn't matter it didn't matter huh i could have said uranus oh it's just funny to say 
[01:37:30]  it didn't matter huh what how many years how long it takes to go around the thing yeah no i'll read  please yeah he'd enjoy it i know sorry calm down uh all right sean yes um what was your wedding  song before you tell the story i'm glad i don't know it's so long ago you don't remember your  wedding you don't remember the first song you danced to that sweet i'm sorry i'm a piece of 
[01:38:00]  shit what i'm just sorry i'm just a sorry piece of shit you really don't remember the first song you  danced to no well i remember the song that you danced with your father what was that butterfly  kisses butterfly kisses all right so you were standing on the side watching that sweet tender  moment yeah a sweet moment between a father and a daughter and then we'll let you tell your story  but we got to play the song a little bit that's pretty uh that's pretty tender moment for a father  and a daughter he's giving away his little girl right to uh a man so there's sean on the sidelines 
[01:38:30]  just off the dance floor there's there's daddy's little girl and here they are everyone's just  crying there it is let's listen in oh little awkward steps that he remembers as a little girl  perhaps she used to dance on his shoes stand on his shoes as daddy would dance and now she's a woman  being married dancing with dad at her wedding the last time that she's uh his his little girl 
[01:39:00]  his little girl so what did this little girl do to sean uh well i knew it was a mistake from  the beginning when i gave her the right yeah basically it was a constant screaming just like  anthony said just constant nagging and uh so i guess it was almost like self-sabotage after the wedding  yeah and uh so i used to work at a bar as a bartender hooked up a chick nailed her and uh 
[01:39:30]  i got kind of nervous because i heard this chick was a prostitute before daddy's little girl was a  prostitute no no no no the girl he picked up the phone crapped out i'm sorry go ahead so this other  girl i nailed was a prostitute before but from my knowledge so with all nervousness i went and got  tested yeah now they give you this little card basically that you know gives you your anonymity  so you're going to have a number so when you go back to this site or to this place where you got 
[01:40:00]  the test from they can match it up with whatever test you got for the results uh-huh came out clean  i was fine but i kept this card for some reason oh and she knew i was acting different well she goes  through the house and she finds this card so she starts nailing me with questions what's going on what's  happening so i finally break down and say fuck it i'm just going to tell her so i tell her she goes  ballistic we're in the bedroom and she's sitting on her bed by the nightstand and there's a picture of 
[01:40:30]  us really even right our wedding picture right so i'm standing by the door and i tell her i slept with  another woman this is where the card came from i was nervous i thought there was cooties on her or  something no more i didn't get a chance to finish the sentence and the picture came flying across the  room and then bedded itself into the she rock wall daddy's little girl everybody daddy's little  girl yeah but you really are dumb why didn't you just tell that you were panicking or you weren't 
[01:41:00]  feeling well and you never know with blood work why didn't you just use a blood work angle we're  saying that it has a ten-year incubation period you were just nervous yeah not everyone is as smart  as you jimmy that's cheating one-on-one sometimes he's folded under pressure yeah i worry about you  henry you may start dropping t-cells it's all hindsight now yeah anyway the chaos at the end  there it started going on she started going after my throat with her nails she started tearing apart  the room wait can we turn up daddy's little girl the little song that was playing those same beautiful 
[01:41:30]  nails that held her father's hand as they danced for now at your throat digging into sean's adulterous  throat so i take her and i chuck her outside you threw daddy's little girl out on the lawn there  you go as he looked over at you as the man that was going to take his place taking care of his  little girl my knight in shining armor you cheat on her and then heaver across the room has now thrown  me outside with the trash on the lawn i continue there sean so i close the door and and and try to 
[01:42:00]  get some stuff together and get my composure back yeah well as the doors close she's outside and she  starts riding into the window with her diamond ring asshole that very diamond going on that very  diamond ring that she was gazing at as her arm was around her father yes as this song was playing at  the wedding now carving asshole in the window and you know she want to carve that right into your forehead  sir she was right though the wife is right in this one dude because you know what you were probably  banging her the whole time without a rubber and now she's like you thought you might have had 
[01:42:30]  aids after having sex and you and all and you're banging it out of rubber she was right she should  have scratched her face i'm not saying i was i'm not saying i was a good guy that was a big thing to do  completely yeah yeah uh so you're you're did you get a divorce after that oh yeah it's done and gone  but when i checked her outside and i heard that scratching on the window i went to go check it she  had finished with the window it started kicking those uh headlights and breaking the wipers off my car  daddy's little girl those little feet that danced in front of daddy were now going through his 
[01:43:00]  headlight's butterfly kisses butterfly kisses very nothing else for you thank you sean that's a good  one there what a beautiful story wait let's with a beautiful song  oh yes see there's a little kid sounds like daddy remembers hey s  s-s-h-o you son of a bitch exactly

[01:51:00]  over there 11 months um i'm sure this i'm sure this song would come on during the time you were there  and would get her through because uh it would remind her of the the great time that you had at  at your wedding and the commitment you made to each other and uh the love that you two had  yeah right yes and you had such a great relationship you knew it was gonna last right so 11 months away 
[01:51:30]  at war uh a man going off to war that's nothing for you guys in your relationship yeah but well it  turns out whenever i got home it was i was due to be discharged so i know sooner get home processed  out fly at home i get to the airport and if my parents are there to pick me up no problem i said  that's a little odd my wife's not there but we wind up getting home and they have this big thanksgiving  dinner for us her family's there my grandparents everybody and i look at her and she's seven months 
[01:52:00]  pregnant seven months pregnant don't let don't let opie do the math on this one uh jim uh you're  gone 11 months she's seven months pregnant so that means that means that that they had sex 18 months  before yeah so four months into your stay in the uh middle east she's uh getting pregnant there yeah  oh boy did you find out who it was oh yeah wow you're shooting off rounds and some guy back home is 
[01:52:30]  also shooting off rounds oh yeah and i mean the worst part about it wait here's here's you in the middle east  yeah you're just trying to survive fighting for your country doing the right thing  and your wife is at home getting rounds blown into her as well 
[01:53:00]  they convinced my mother and my best friend and stuff don't tell me because they thought it was  gonna upset me i don't know if they thought i was gonna try to eat the barrel of my m6 yeah they  probably didn't want you uh upset when you're over there and got a job to do why didn't she get an  abortion what's wrong with her i miserable bitch and anyways i walk in and it was just like a deer  in the headlights man there must have been 25 people standing there looking directly at me when 
[01:53:30]  i come in the door and i look over at her and i mean she's obviously pregnant i mean only a  fucking idiot could miss the point and i'm just standing there and she says i got a little surprise for  you yeah yeah i ran straight to my room and i don't want to come out everybody's like go out and  talk to her and stuff so finally i get down and i sit at the dinner table oh and it's just what she  said you know and everybody's just looking at me and i finally freaked out stood up and somehow or 
[01:54:00]  another i just start cussing now mind you this is in front of my grandmother my aunts my uncles i'm  just you know dirty whore filthy shank come burping gutter flight you know the whole nine yards right  now deal is to say we wound up getting divorced and stuff but it was a horrible time i hate  thanksgiving to this fucking day so obviously uh we need to know who was banging her while you were  over there fighting for america i got i went to school with a guy you went to school with a draft 
[01:54:30]  dodger and dude no offense but your family is awful they should then have never put you in that  situation surprise belly full of his seed yeah what did they want from you well my dad and my  best friend wanted to tell me so bad but wait wait wait wait wait wait you know but she's sitting  there she's seven months pregnant you come in the door obviously they were hoping that you two would  work something out because right i mean she wasn't with this guy anymore stupid no her mom and my mom 
[01:55:00]  were best friends and somehow or another they convinced you know it was almost like it was my  fault for leaving her being young you know what i mean oh well you should have right hooked her right  in the belly and then sat down at your turkey while she sat there hemorrhaging you asked someone to pass  the gravy what's that cranberry sauce in your lap or junior oh should have laid there moaning like a  big stuffed turkey herself that is unbelievable that really sickens me yeah really especially 
[01:55:30]  only gone four months yeah he was gone for three years he's gone 11 months no no but by the time  she went she got pregnant he was gone all right right he's gone for four months later well they were  well excuse me excuse me how long was there another math mistake made no four months all right  good yeah but that's when she got pregnant though they obviously were banging a lot probably a lot  sooner than that right um we were living in florida at the time and she wound up she didn't want to 
[01:56:00]  wind up staying by herself but she came back to pennsylvania to stay with her parents right  all right yeah there you go but it all started with angel from aerosmith anthony yeah thank you bumper  i have a little surprise for you a little surprise and he's probably thinking it's something good  well he probably saw it and that was her on her like awkward reaction oh look guess who's a whore  surprise wow you're married a whore you guys got to hear this laszlo who does all the audio for  grand theft auto um san andreas who's going to be on our show eventually to to talk about the game 
[01:56:30]  he uh he does the audio i'm not sure what you mean from he see voices all of it or he produced all  of it uh he produces all the audio but his voice is heard as well yeah does the commercials that you  hear for it produces a lot of those a lot of commercials about the radio stations puts all  the radio stations together okay uh he made a uh monster rain commercial in honor of jim norton oh  nice and it sounds like something you would hear while you're playing gta yeah monster rain sweeping 
[01:57:00]  the nation it's really it really is taking over folks well we already have what three or four  monster rain songs now we got this fake commercial it's uh it's getting out of hand hats shirts  portable porches listen to this he was just the boy next door mikey where are you  it's the game for kids that's sweeping the country what are you doing jesus h christ my little  baby monster rain monster the game you play under the porch monster 
[01:57:30]  oh that's great terrific oh wow is there a little like yeah sound at the beginning of that there  certainly is yeah there's uh that's good lazlo right uh fantastic yeah you know we're getting  a lot of new listeners every day because people signing up for our channel and uh xm satellite radio  in general when we take our first break which um i think might be thanksgiving day i guess yeah 
[01:58:00]  somewhere around there we'll definitely replay the monster rain the the story that started this uh  phenomenon the story that jimmy should never ever have told right so what a dirty story we'll take a  quick break um boy the phone's still just exploding um and we got to get to other things obviously  today but of course back from my iraq letter what was that i wrote that down i have no idea what that  means um oh i know do you have that still remember how we were talking about the we were playing the 
[01:58:30]  audio from fallujah how these guys are just in the shit and they're just like shooting off rounds and  just you know trying to like uh survive and sure and they're uh you know havoc and they're working  just you know multi-million dollar uh equipment and tanks and stuff like that well a guy sent an  email i told you to save for you uh instant feedback saved from yesterday ben is like oh yeah where is  it ben are you got it all right because remember we're like it it must suck when you come back to the  states and then you have to go back to your regular life after i mean listen to this is like real real 
[01:59:00]  crap yeah this is some audio from fallujah we could do this actually fast before you want a break  it's still barriers  oh yeah oh damn so that's great by the way god damn i mean the first uh the first track we have is 
[01:59:30]  um  they're screaming in the background  but then you know the reality is a lot most of these guys go back to their regular lives if 
[02:00:00]  they're lucky yeah some of these guys don't some a lot of guys aren't coming home and then you  wonder what their lives are like after they get home yeah and uh we talked about that yesterday a  little bit well matt um wrote a quick little thing on the instant feedback that video is great because  this is video that you can check out on uh op and anthony.com foundry music.com and then he writes it's  kind of a let down after you get back i used to drive a billion dollar submarine  and now i drive a minivan where's the excitement in that and now i drive a minivan you can't even 
[02:00:30]  imagine what it's like to see it live i'm telling you because i i got to see that when i was in the  army i got joe was 82nd airborne 82nd airborne and i was in uh i was attached to an armor unit so i got to  see like sheridan tanks firing rounds live yeah and what you see on video what you hear on the audio  is is nothing it's you can't you can't compare to seeing it live is that army airborne or air force  army yeah and it was and it was it was just it was it was stupid i mean the the ground would boil when 
[02:01:00]  they sent when they set off these anti-personnel rounds and they would fire it out of a sheridan fire  it downrange you would see it you would see it air burst and anything below like the size of a  football field the ground would literally boil oh nothing in that nothing in that area in in that uh  you know oh what's the math 2 000 square yard area would uh would would possibly live i mean it's just 
[02:01:30]  yeah amazing amazing to see it live all right i don't know what they have now yeah i saw that some  of the clips from fallujah where they put shit on their shoulders that is like one thing that  the what came out of it it was like the size of a toilet bowl the opening on this thing the stinger  yeah they just let loose it explodes and they're all wow you know they just blew the side of a building  out i love it i love the footage they're getting well is that uh those rounds the explosive round 
[02:02:00]  i was telling you about before with that guy that was wounded you know one of the insurgents wounded  and it was a sniper that took two shots at him and wounded him said i'll get him with this one  and he loaded up and an explosive round hit the wall behind the guy and blew him blew him up literally  blew him up yeah they they got to keep some of these uh embedded reporters away from uh the marines though  i think it really yeah like there shouldn't be some some video of some of this stuff you got to let  the marines do their work now there's a marine in trouble uh for killing some guy an insurgent in a mosque 
[02:02:30]  um apparently the marines went in on i think it was a friday wiped out whatever resistance was in  this mosque left the wounded behind like hey someone will pick you up later these guys don't  have the time it's a war going on they're not going to be it's it's not like an episode of mash  oh bring the north korean guy in here well hawk i'll patch him up you know it's like now sit there  one of your buddies will pick you up drag you out of here and if you're lucky you'll get fixed up 
[02:03:00]  so they leave uh the next day they find out that more insurgents are back using the mosque again  and firing rounds at uh americans so another marine detachment goes in wipes out those guys and sees  some of the guys that were there from the day before so one of the marines now this is on video  walks over to one of the guys and goes he's quoted as saying uh from the tape oh this guy's  fucking faking it this guy's faking that he's fucking dead boom shoots him right in the head  now got in trouble for that got in big trouble the guy's laying there he is unarmed he's not 
[02:03:30]  threatening at all he's laying there so if you videotape a soldier doing that it's not our policy  our wartime policy to do things like that but it is wartime things like this happen they go on the  guy the day before the guy that the marine that shot him was shot in the face right so he i guess  was a little agitated um you can't now bring this guy up on charges i i don't like it i don't like  that i'll tell you why i disagree with you because it's almost like we have a certain we're supposed 
[02:04:00]  to have a different standard of warfare like like we're supposed to when you when your guy is unarmed  again if it's a mistake it's a mistake but when you know he's unarmed i mean you can't blast his head  out you can't no because it is not like you're you're there's no honor it's not a soldier a uniformed  fucking soldier this isn't a guy that surrendered uh that's fighting for a country under a flag and  a uniform this is a scumbag that if he didn't shoot him in the head perhaps he would have gotten 
[02:04:30]  better gotten up and killed some other american maybe a week down the road i'm saying this is not  a war like we're used to fighting but you still have to have the same you still have to have the  same shirt again if you don't know the guy is unarmed you don't know he's unarmed i'm not saying  mistakes shouldn't be made but if you know the guy's unarmed and he's laying there you can't  blast him you can't do it i don't know what would colonel kurtz do colonel kurtz would chop his head  off and put it on a stage he would throw his book of poems out of him and go shut up 
[02:05:00]  what are they gonna say he was an uncircumcised man he was a religious man  yeah i just don't uh i i don't like the idea of these press following these guys around let them do their  job and it's their job sometimes entails going a little crazy because you were shot in the face  the day before and killing insurgents these aren't soldiers of honor doesn't matter not soldiers of  honor neither with the vietnamese uh neither with the koreans the same way maybe we wouldn't have  had a run tail uh tucked between our legs out of that fucking country now that didn't have 
[02:05:30]  anything to do with it because the politicians here you know that was that wasn't the problem  i got news for you man from from from world war from from the civil war on war is you know what it is  it's not nice it's you cannot be a human being if you're involved if you're there you cannot be a  human being and be successful people have this illusion they they believe that we as americans  are so above that that we should be we should be this uh uh different than anyone else it's war 
[02:06:00]  it's men killing other men and it it affects people uh the same way and i'm not saying that sometimes if  like you go and inoculate some children that someone shouldn't come and lop off the little  inoculated arms leave a pile a little pile of arms and then you'd cry like some i think grandmother  less honorable so soldiers were those moronic englishmen that lined up yeah you know across  the battlefield that's the way to do it stood there and got shot as they got held i'm not saying that 
[02:06:30]  people don't get shot and that american soldiers shouldn't be vicious what i'm saying is when a guy is  laying there unarmed and you know he's unarmed it's all because if we saw the reverse if i saw one of  those savages kill an american soldier like that i would want them nuked you have they drag him through  the streets well in somalia they did they're awesome exactly and and that's why i i really have no mercy  for them when they starve this is warfare also against uh terrorists against they're not honorable  soldiers they act like animals and they're killed like i know what you're saying but i still don't 
[02:07:00]  think it's almost like abu grab there's just certain things you shouldn't do you just can't  do i mean the u.s military you know they rely on our compassion which makes me sick to to start these  insurgents to begin with because they wouldn't do it when saddam was in power so i have a loathing for  the entire iraqi population but i have more of a respect for our military you just can't shoot a guy  in the head of these land there and you know he's not armed i don't know that could could have come  back and bit him in the ass down the road or killed another american possible you know joe brings up a  good point though when we were fighting the british how stupid do you have to be to just be 
[02:07:30]  dropping off toward guns you marching into those little round you had the little yeah your job is  to play the flute yeah flying over your head yeah who's that guy oh you're you're the flute player  yeah uh do i get a gun or something all 300 who playing but you i'm just saying every war i mean  every war since has been like dirty yeah you know i mean they just they didn't have embedded reporters  back in world war ii right oh there were horrors in world war i'm the i'm the flute player ten 
[02:08:00]  times i'm gonna play the flute i'm the drummer i'm the drummer boy the guy that holds the flag  the private flute's name is charlene sir leonard talks to his flute that was just the stupidest thing  as far as warfare goes we're gonna have a band we're gonna we're gonna have a band walking uh across the  battlefield oh god why aren't you tuning private piles 
[02:08:30]  just marching just waiting for that freaking little ball to nail you in the forehead  all right well yeah we should break i guess i was just running through full metal jacket  references i couldn't think of another one to keep that going they're always silver plated  full metal mouthpiece  speaking of bands open aren't there going to be oh my god shut up joe  shut up plug meister i know anthony wants to say it i'll say today shut up shut up with his plugs

[02:16:00]  Runnin' on our way out  I'm on our way out  You will be dying  A thousand deaths  Searching  Seek and destroy  Searching  Seek and destroy  Seek and destroy  Seek and destroy  Seek and destroy 
[02:16:30]  Seek and destroy  Seek and destroy  For all our boys over there, Anthony  Apparently  Apparently a lot of people saying  Saying that  The insurgents  Have been playing dead  What they do is play dead  And when you walk past them  Or you're walking near them  Under their road  They have a weapon  The guy said he's playing dead  And shot him 
[02:17:00]  So if it was a defensive move  If he thought he was in danger  But from what I've heard about that  It doesn't look like he thought  He was in danger  If he thought he was in danger  That's one thing  But if he was just angry  You can't do it  I think you think you're in danger  Being there  But I don't know  I wasn't there, Jimmy  Unlike Jimmy  I wasn't there  I wasn't there either  Oh, you're right  I was over there  Jimmy was in the shit  As you're walking past  You should kick every dead guy  In the nuts  There you go  As hard as you can  That'll get a reaction 
[02:17:30]  You do not want to be on the receiving end of that  Man  There's still barriers there  Oh, damn  Oh, damn  Nice  Back, back, back 
[02:18:00]  Alright, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America  Someone really pissed off at Jimmy on the line here  Let's talk to Jeff in New Jersey  Why?  Jeff says that Jim knows nothing about war  Go ahead, Jeff  Hey, Jim Norton, are you crazy?  This guy was laying there playing possum  How do you know  That this guy wasn't going to try and reach for something  When they turned him back?  What I just said  What I just said was  If it was a defensive move 
[02:18:30]  If he thought  Dude, dude, dude  Let me finish what I'm saying  I'm listening to you  Let me respond  If it was a defensive move  And he thought he was in danger  That's one thing  But if he  If you were in for a while  Or whatever the hell the name of the joint is  You wouldn't think you were in danger?  Alright, you keep talking  And keep repeating yourself  I know what you're saying  I don't agree with it  If he thought he was in danger and he was fired  But if he was angry and he thought  Fuck this motherfucker  And he just killed him  You know what?  Emotionally I agree with him  But you can't do that  I think they're all savages 
[02:19:00]  You can't do what they did in Abu Ghraib  Because it makes it harder for the rest of the military  They could burn our guys and hang them off a bridge  And they could chop people's heads  Dude, I'm  I'm  What do you want me to tell you?  I agree with you  They're savages  So that's why we're over there eliminating them  And when they're playing possum  If the guy was reaching out begging for help  That's one thing  We would have sent them a medic  But if the guy's laying there playing possum  You gotta frag them  You gotta be kidding me  You gotta be kidding me  That's why you're over here  And I wouldn't want you over there  Oh really?  I'm not pro-military because I don't believe  I don't agree with what this guy did 
[02:19:30]  So all of a sudden I'm not pro-military?  You fucking idiot  Sorry I wasn't over there  I don't get that you shouldn't shoot an unarmed guy in the head  You idiots lost the election  What idiots lost the election?  All of a sudden you're a liberal Democrat  You fucking dummy  Nobody hates liberals more than I do  You idiot  Yeah right  You can tell by the way you talk  Yeah yeah  I'm a real liberal  Because I don't agree with a guy assassinating a guy laying on his stomach  I hate those people  The more I learn about them  The more I like Saddam for gassing them  You just want to clean them up and send them to college? 
[02:20:00]  You fucking idiot  Yeah yeah that's what I want to do  Obviously  You jackass  Because I'm pro-  Because I'm pro-  I don't think the military is above any type of criticism  I'm a liberal  You goddamn dummy  Can I be a-  Can I be a-  You don't think you should defend them?  Yeah can I be the-  You ain't listen to what I said  Jesus fucking Christ  You are the problem  Hold on  Holy shit do I hate that kind of ignorance  Can I be the voice-  You unbending idiot  I wanna be the voice of reason here though  Somebody slap him for me will you please?  Yeah I know I don't get it man  I wasn't there  Fuck you  You 
[02:20:30]  Geez  Good thing you weren't there  You don't wind up in a bush  Yeah I know I'm really a liberal  I voted for John Kerry  I hyphenate  I say African American  You probably do  Yeah I know probably do  Fuck you stupid  God that irritates me  But just knowing you Jim  I would think that you would be okay with what happened  Emotionally I am  Okay  I think it's great that he-  Cause I mean I-  Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff  You're not listening  Alright and everyone-  You just talk and you don't listen  No he listened  No he didn't listen  Jeff I-  Hey you weren't there man  I was in the shed 
[02:21:00]  Jeff I know Norton for a while trust me  Don't explain me to him  Don't explain me to him  Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff  You didn't think that was okay  You seem to be hardcore  Let's just nuke the mother  All I said  No no no I'm talking  Thomist  Stupid  Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff Jeff  And the war on TV for 2 years you idiot 
[02:21:30]  idiot. The problem I have is when things like this or Abu Ghraib,  anything that happens that is above and beyond what we're doing over there, what the military  is doing over there, it just gives people more of a reason to complain.  The people are having their heads lopped off because that Abu Ghraib thing,  people are going, you see, they do hate Islam. They are over here to humiliate us. That's just an excuse.  They were going to do that anyway. I know that. I know that. But it makes it harder for the soldiers  that are over there. It makes it harder for people that are kidnapped. Well, what makes it harder is guys like  you and I'm talking about people fragging somebody for no reason when there is a reason. 
[02:22:00]  If there was a reason, if he just shot him. Okay, you know what?  You know what? You're right, man. Anyone over there should be able to shoot anyone and they're just  fragging them because they have to. Shut the fuck up. Women and children because they're just going to grow up  and hit our bets too. Yeah, really? Okay, so Americans should be treated a certain way  when we're captured, but we should have no way to treat somebody else.  Not if they're at war, would I? No, no, you're right. You're absolutely right. We should be outraged  if our soldiers are dragged through the streets, which we are, but if the guy shoots a guy 
[02:22:30]  in the head because he's pissed off that he got shot the other day, we should have no reaction  to that. That's exactly right. Okay, good. Then don't complain when people hate the American  military because of attitudes like that. Don't complain if you have a double standard for  the way we're supposed to behave and react. To hate the military is one thing. To fear the  military is another. Is it really? What is that? Who read you read that from? Mario Puzo?  Duh, they will always respect you. Jesus Christ, stop with the cliches. How many times have  you had that conversation by yourself on the toilet? To hate the military is one thing. 
[02:23:00]  To fear it is another. Like you're going to be a great man speaking in front of many people.  You're not Ronnie Kovacs, stupid.  This is a regular Joe, pal, and I know what it's like.  I know you're a regular Joe because you've been there.  You obviously don't have any idea.  I take it you're military.  All right, Jeff, thank you.  Well, I want to ask Jeff if he's military.  Jeff, are you military?  Exactly. Fucking die.  No, no. You know what he didn't quite understand is that you're not saying that it was a bad  thing. You're saying under certain circumstances that shouldn't have happened. If, in fact, 
[02:23:30]  he was trying to do something, then he should have been shot.  This is why I hope Jeff is killed in a drunk driving accident. And I mean this. On the way  to a fucking Thanksgiving dinner, I hope a drunk driving truck barrels into you. And I hope  your family is okay, and they're all healthy, and they just watch you drop dead. And you  say some stupid cliche, to love is good, to fear is better.  What I was saying, now that you can't answer back, he's probably yelling at the radio, 
[02:24:00]  you hear how I told him, honey? He wasn't there. If the guy was legitimately in fear of  his life, it doesn't matter that the guy was unarmed, because you're in a war, you have  to react.  Right.  But if it was an assassination, if he saw the guy and was just mad and went, ah, fuck  him, you can't do that. And he's throwing around words like, frag. I know, I saw Platoon  too, stupid.  I play video games.  Yeah, he fragged him.  You're with Artie Murphy, my man. Oh, I hate that guy.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Nidget Sighting of the Day. 
[02:24:30]  Oh.  Ah, BJ in Oakdale, what's going on, buddy?  How the fuck am I supposed to follow a Norton rant?  Dude, I don't even want to rant. I was actually trying to talk nice to the guy and just explain  what I was trying to say. But for someone to call me a liberal and say I'm anti-military,  it's almost, it's laughable. Yeah, it really is. It shows how he does not pay attention.  Well, let's see if BJ. By the way, that guy's called in before, he doesn't like me, so he  was just probably goading me because he doesn't like me. There's people that don't like us,  that's fine. I have no problem with that, especially if they're on us. Oh, the guy from the boneyard, 
[02:25:00]  you mean? Who's always trashing us, is that the guy? Yeah, some guy. He's a fan. Is he  a fan? Some guy from the boneyard, I'm getting emails, he wants to slap me in the face, good  luck. I'm going to be down in Washington soon, I want to see you try to slap me in the  face, okay? You know, it'll be like, hey, dude, what's up, man? And if I don't take  you out, trust me, my brothers will fly down to Washington and take you out. It's not about  taking him out, it's just that he wants you to mention him so he can act like he's in  this big radio war when your job is to do this, hey, talk, talk, talk, talk, play, you get  to talk for three seconds. Yeah. So he wants you to mention his name. Don't even mention 
[02:25:30]  his name, I don't even know it. But if you want to slap me in the face, you give it a shot  next time I'm in Washington. Let's see how far that goes, okay? Battles here. Everybody's  a tough guy. We had that problem with the Vanderbilt with Anthony, remember? Tough guy? What? Yeah, we  were up in the box. We were at the Vanderbilt. It was a show at the Vanderbilt. And we were  up in the box and those guys were down on the floor screaming up at you. And as soon as  like four of us came walking downstairs, they left, they cleared out. There's always tough  guys. There's always tough guys on the air. They always tell you they're going to smack 
[02:26:00]  you. Well, have fun trying to slap me in the face. We'll see. BJ, what's up? All right.  I got a midget signing for you. All right. A couple of weeks ago, I went to a bar in Le Grand  Kongama and I'm walking in and I see this midget girl. And you know, seeing a midget is funny  enough. But then I realized she's really narrow. And then it occurred to me, she had no fucking  arms. She was an armless midget. So did you grab her head and just use her mouth as a pocket  pussy? Jesus. And what was she doing? No need to worry about her, mate. She's armless. 
[02:26:30]  I shouldn't make fun of midgets. I don't get it. Cause I'm not a midget, man. I wasn't  there. I can't talk about it, man. I was in the shit, man. You don't know how dangerous  midgets can be. Yeah, man. I might have to frag a midget, man. What else did Kevin Dillon  say in that movie? And what was the midget doing? Well, she was on her cell phone and 
[02:27:00]  it was the funniest thing. How is she on a cell phone with no arms? She has a friend  that walks around with her all the time. And holds her phone? Yeah. And it's the funniest  thing. Cause she's got like a little fat head and she's trying to squeeze the phone between  her head and like her non-existent shoulders. It's kind of like leaning up. I wonder who she  was on the phone with. Probably God going, thanks for nothing. All right. Meanwhile, back  at the show. Yeah. Back at the show. Sorry about that. We have another guy that has a 
[02:27:30]  wedding story. Want to try one more, Anthony? We'll try one more. We're all over the ball  field today, but Sean is on the line. Hey, Sean. Hey, what's up? So you got a marriage thing  you want to talk about here? Well, it's kind of unusual. I got married. All right. Hold  on. Hold on. What was your wedding song? Love Me Tender, Elvis Presley. Love Me Tender.  Do we have that queued up in the booth? All right. Let's start the song. Here we go.  Oh, you were dancing with your sweetheart, right? Oh, well, we got married to it. Elvis married 
[02:28:00]  it. Wait, you actually had an Elvis impersonator marry you? Yeah. We got married in Vegas. I  was on escape. I got married under a fake name. Wait, you escaped from prison, it's saying  on the line here. Yeah. Wait, you escaped from prison. And I was out on escape and met my  wife and we got married. Three years later when she got pregnant, I had to tell her the  truth because, you know, we had a kid coming and she talked me into turning myself in. So 
[02:28:30]  I turned myself back in and so we'd get the right name on everything. And I ended up having  go back to prison for another eight months. What were you, uh, what were you in prison  for? For possession of marijuana. Wait, possession of marijuana. You only had eight months to  go and you escaped? No. Hell, I had, I had possession of marijuana. I had a one to five  and they put me on a outside detail and I run off after being in for two months. That's 
[02:29:00]  kind of stupid. Well, you know, I've just come on Vietnam. First fucking rule is you get  a chance to escape, you escape. So in Vietnam. So did you escape, did you escape like you see  it in, uh, the, in the movies? Did you have to run or run in a river and, uh, you know,  they had me on this fairground detail where we went up and painted bleachers at the fairground  and shit. Right. And I just took off. I knew the area. I'd been raised around that area. So I took 
[02:29:30]  off and run. I went to California and on the way to California, I met this girl. We ended up getting  married. And we're still married. Women are nuts. And she, she talks you into turning yourself in.  You're free. Well, yeah, but I was under a fake name and everything was fake. Were they looking for  you? No, they wasn't really looking for me, but, uh, you know, by the time I got back to the state, 
[02:30:00]  they done changed the fucking law position of a joint of marijuana was only a hundred dollar fine.  So I got out of that, but the escape stuck. Right. Oh, see. So then you were in trouble for  the escape. Right. Oh man. It would have been better off just staying in prison. Well, yeah,  but I never would have met my wife. Well, that's true. Everything worked out just fine. You guys  still married? Yeah. Good for you, sir. Good for you. Attaboy. But I had to buy two fucking wedding  rings. All right. Well, thank you. There you go. All right. That, that bit's done. That actually, 
[02:30:30]  uh, was a happy ending to the whole thing, Opie. Yes. I can't tell you how irritated I am. I'm sure  you are. I can't express how annoyed I am. You know what is annoying about that? Holy shit. If you're,  if you, it doesn't matter how supportive you are of the administration or, or the soldiers  or the war or, uh, but when you, you try to, you start to question any of it, you immediately 
[02:31:00]  go from a Republican who supports the war effort to a bedwetting liberal Democrat. Like, oh,  you, you mentioned one thing that you don't agree with and it's like, oh, well, that's why  your side didn't win. My side, what? It's like as pro cop as I am. And I defend the cops vehemently.  Mm-hmm. Yet when you see Diallo, yeah, you know, they overreacted or, you know, there's  cop signs where cops got to go to jail because they, they fuck up. Hey, what do you hate 
[02:31:30]  the cops? No. Jim Norton's at drug dealers' bedsides in the hospital, uh, giving them,  uh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I would be if my last name was Dinkins. Politizing. I'm sorry that  that officer shot your son who was shooting at him. Yeah. Wow. That's why he was thrown  up. I, I, I hope Jeff is paralyzed. All right. Relax. We're moving on here. Jim from  Philly. What's up? Oh, the neck. Hey. Hey. Wax fruit.  You guys used to take phone calls and if you didn't like them, you'd end up hanging  up on everybody. Yeah. What happened to that? I just did. Yeah, but you guys, you guys are 
[02:32:00]  taking a lot. Everybody's droning on. Yeah, the phone calls are, uh, yeah, the, the listeners  aren't doing their job today. Punish us. Punish us. Like you used to do. Like do that? You're  gone. Punish us. Yeah. I mean, the listeners, you know, they're not doing their job today.  You know what it is. We're going to too many truckers is what it is. The truckers are very lonely  out there and they like to talk. We realize that now. But people kind of remember the,  uh, later days at NEW. We're still training the audience open. Yeah. They don't remember 
[02:32:30]  what it was like when we first got to NEW, the droning calls we used to get there about  the music. Shut up and play the music. Remember those people? Oh yeah. It wasn't all fun and  games like it was at the end of our tenure over there. Oh no. So this is the beginning phases.  That's what happened. All right. We got a couple things we could do here. We got, um,  we did the monster thing. We got the Anna Nicole audio, I guess. I don't like that.  We got the audio. It's anti-woman. Is it anti-woman? Cause I really don't want to hear  anything that's anti-woman. Jim, relax. What? I'm just saying that. I don't want to hear 
[02:33:00]  anything that's anti-woman. I think you, uh, you know, he takes these things to heart.  I don't understand that, but you made your point. Anything that's anti-woman.  You made your point. Relax. What's this audio about? I don't even know the story.  What, the Anna Nicole story? Yeah, yeah. Oh, we haven't even got to his audio yet. Nope.  The, uh, Anna Nicole story, she was at an award show and she was supposed to be, uh,  introducing something. She's totally wasted and drunk. Live on stage on television.  Wasted and drunk, huh? Sorry. Totally wasted. Right on the stage there.  Was she fat and chubby? Or was she skinny and emaciated? 
[02:33:30]  Guess what happened? Talk and speak. Point proven. Anyway, so she's up there. She's barely making any...  Was she rambling and babbling? Ben's doing an impression of her.  When Ben is making fun of your movements. Oh my God.  I would slap him in the face if I was you.  Ooh. Because that's such a manly thing to say you want to do to somebody.  Yeah, especially right before you play another record at 3 a.m. and nobody knows your name.  Fucking dullard on a channel in the middle of nowhere. Shut your face.  Hey, you haven't been there. You're right. You've never been on at 4 in the morning with 
[02:34:00]  five people listening, man. Okay, let's continue. She's on stage. She's trying to make  a presentation. She's so drunk and wasted. She's talking about herself and she's slurring  her speech and she's fading in and out of consciousness while on stage. She's leaning  over and coming back up and not recognizing what she's talking about.  This is the Anna Nicole we love. And I think it's something she's taking to stay skinny.  It's the American Music Awards. Is that what it was from?  Oh, the award show where there wasn't a fight and a stabbing?  Oh, what was that? Is that what the big fight that we've seen on TV all day is? 
[02:34:30]  That's the five awards, yeah.  Oh, we'll talk about that. We've got some info on that. But let's go to Anna Nicole first.  Anna Nicole Smith.  Like my body? 
[02:35:00]  I was honored to be on our next performer's new video.  Oh.  And if I ever record an album, I want this guy to produce mom to make me beautiful duets.  When did she have a stroke?  She's freaking genius! 
[02:35:30]  Make some noise for my boy, Kanye West!  Wow.  What?  Wow.  That big gap was when she nodded off. That big delay that was in the middle of there  is when she just kind of nodded off. 
[02:36:00]  Just faded out?  Yeah.  Faded out. I was taking a little snooze at the podium.  Oh, wow.  We'll have an OD story soon.  And what was she introducing?  I don't know.  She just went...  All right.  What a mess.  What did Kimmel come out and say?  He said that she got into Snoop Dogg's brownies or something like that.  Oh, is that the joke?  Kimmel is hilarious, man.  He came back.  I miss his calls to this radio show.  That guy is great.  Pat in D.C., what's up? 
[02:36:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  The talk about marriage was so depressing.  I just had to get a blowjob from a 17-year-old crack whore on the corner down here to cheer myself back up.  We condone that.  We condone that.  Somehow I figured you would.  That's funny.  All right.  D.C., not hard to find.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  There's a quick phone call.  That listener did it right.  Popped the phone on.  He came out with what he wanted to say, and he's out.  Where's Steve? 
[02:37:00]  Steve got a prank call from a DJ, and, man, this guy thinks this is really good, and he's excited for us to play it.  And, you know, we run our own channel here, High Voltage 202.  I would love to give exposure to some guys out there.  A lot of the radio guys have XM Satellite Radio.  Absolutely.  I know for a fact Howard Stern has XM Satellite Radio, and, you know, a lot of the people in the business, you know, because they want to check out the latest technology and the new thing.  And they got XM Satellite Radio, and they're doing their awful show somewhere else in America, talking to five people in the middle of the night. 
[02:37:30]  And they may have some talent, Anthony.  Yeah.  You never know.  So, you know, sure.  Send your stuff in to us, and we'll give you exposure.  We'll give you all the credit.  No problem.  We're not going to steal your material or anything.  Never know what little tidbit of fun we're going to get.  Maybe someday we'll even give you some time on our channel.  I don't know.  Sure.  Maybe we could build something, you know.  But this guy, Double J, from KNKK, The Knack.  Oh, the...  The name of the station.  Yeah.  The Knack. 
[02:38:00]  The Knack.  107.1 The Knack.  In what is it?  Lake Havasu?  Lake Havasu City, Arizona.  What does he do?  He's the morning guy.  The morning freak, Anthony.  And the PD.  He's the PD, too?  Oh, my God.  PD slash morning show.  Martini Steve.  It was delayed.  All right.  All right.  So what did he...  Mulled him into a false sense of security.  He sent this to you?  Yeah.  He emailed it last night.  I guess he got a call from someone soliciting timeshares. 
[02:38:30]  And I lured him into a prank call.  Uh-huh.  And he sent this wonderful piece of audio.  Because he can't play it on his show, right?  Because he can't play it on his show.  It's too outrageous?  Too outrageous for his show.  Oh, exactly.  So obviously he's a fan of our show, I guess?  Evidently.  So it says, ONA.  So this guy calls my station trying to sell me a timeshare, but he has the wrong number.  Thought I'd have a little fun with him.  Unfortunately, I can't play it on the station I work at.  Got people who just don't and won't see the humor in ball cancer jokes. 
[02:39:00]  Well, if it was...  Oh, whatever.  We'll play.  So if you guys like the phone call, you're more than welcome to use it.  This is just the tip of the iceberg of some stuff I got.  Isn't that great?  That's like saying the tip of the iceberg is like saying, hey, I got a funny story.  Right.  If you guys would like...  It isn't.  I'm more than willing to send you some other stuff as well.  If Double J's listening, yeah, send in more stuff.  I know you guys must get a ton of emails, so I'll leave the ball, insert rim shot here,  in your court. 
[02:39:30]  Laugh.  Oh, LOL.  He didn't write LOL.  I don't believe it.  Yeah, he did.  And then it says, glad you guys are back in the air.  And it's Double J, the PD, and the Morning Freak at KNKK, the NAC 107.1.  Where?  In Lake Havasu City, Arizona.  Arizona.  You didn't think I could pronounce that, did you?  I didn't know where it was.  You were testing me.  No, I'm not.  I don't know what's better.  The material?  I'm practicing at home.  The material or the man-cow-like delivery.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, here it is.  If you want us to stop, just kind of, you know, raise your hand or whatever. 
[02:40:00]  I'll do this.  You'll do that?  And what will you do?  I'm going to go like this.  Oh, okay.  That's a good one.  I'll cross my arms with the forearms.  Yes, Steve?  Did they catch the misspell of the word iceberg in the email?  Oh.  Your hat's on fire.  Wow, this is...  How do you spell iceberg?  I-C-E-B-E-R-G.  Nathaniel actually retyped it from something that was on my PDA.  I'm not sure if he caught it or not. 
[02:40:30]  Did he spell it with the U spelling?  I fixed it.  Sorry.  He spelled it B-U-R-G?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  We should go shoot him.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Who cares?  Dummy.  You know, it's a funny story, but one time this guy sent me an email, and he was supposed  to put a dash, but he used a semicolon.  Give me those ribs.  Eric, don't ever, ever bring my attention to that shit again.  Oh, you blame Eric.  Yeah, I do.  Because you can't think for yourself.  Awful point.  Why would we care about that?  I thought it was really bad.  He made it sound like it was an awful, awful misspelling error, but... 
[02:41:00]  Is this wrong of me to bring up a one time me and Oprah talking at IM, and he wrote  don't, and he forgot the apostrophe?  Oh!  Yeah!  R-O-F-L.  L-M-A-O.  G-A.  What's that?  Get aged.  Why are you looking at Eric like you want to kill him?  It's all right.  I made a production piece for him.  I don't...  We played that right there.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I think so.  Ah, damn.  All right.  All right, that got him.  Well, here's the... 
[02:41:30]  He just had water come out of his nose.  That's great.  You know the best thing to do on IM, and I learned it from Norton, and I did it to Earl.  You know, you get into an IM conversation, and then all of a sudden you write something  like, wow, that is a really nice, big, juicy cock.  And you write it to someone you know, and then you just wait, and you wait, and you wait,  and you wait, and they don't write you back? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden you just write, oh, sorry, wrong IM.  Anyway, that's a great gag, and text messaging like that is good, too.  Like, send one of your guy friends.  It is hilarious, because you could just see...  You could literally see through the IM just sitting there and not responding that they're  just like, oh, my God, what the freak's going on?  Oh, sorry.  I love that.  That one is the...  I did that to Earl a couple times.  I do stuff like that to Earl.  Earl has no idea how to respond.  It'll be like 10 minutes to respond.  They'll try and switch the subject. 
[02:42:30]  Have you heard that new single by Fatboy Slim?  You know, he'll try and change the subject.  Perhaps you could get my Black Rock Coalition in there.  Perhaps Opie could pay for dinner.  I got my agent like that, Pete, one of the first times we ever talked online.  I'm like, dude, I can't wait to suck your cock.  And then I wrote back, oh, sorry, wrong IM.  And there was no, like, ha-ha or LOL from him.  He's like, no, cool.  They don't know what to write back after that.  Of course not.  It's the best.  All right, well, here's the prank call from Double J, the morning freak. 
[02:43:00]  Hello?  Hey, Brent?  Yeah?  This is Doug calling from...  How you doing, Doug?  Good.  How's your day going?  You know it's going.  You know, I found out I got ball cancer today.  You got what cancer?  Ball cancer.  Ball cancer.  Testicular cancer?  Oh.  Well, that's not very good news.  Yeah, so my day's not going that great, you know?  I hear that.  I can relate to that, believe it or not.  Mine's in a little different spot, but I found out about two weeks ago. 
[02:43:30]  Really?  Yep.  What kind of cancer you got?  I've got the colorectal kind.  Well, at least it's not ball cancer.  I do get to do the...  See, here's the problem.  The guy, like, he's not getting the reaction.  Yeah.  So he just keeps going, it's not like ball cancer.  Do you hear me?  It's ball cancer.  Ball cancer.  I got you.  You know what I mean?  George from Philly's already saying stop.  You know, like, he thought the whole ball cancer would get such an unbelievable reaction. 
[02:44:00]  He's not getting the reaction he was hoping for, so he just keeps pounding it into the ground.  Yes, Jim?  Nothing.  It reminds me of one of Florentines.  I don't remember which one.  It just reminds me of one of Terrorizing Telemarketers.  Oh, really?  I do get to do the game.  Not a laughing matter.  You know what I mean?  My balls have cancer in them.  I understand.  Man, it ain't nothing funny about for guys like us.  No, it's not.  No, siri.  Yeah.  Ball cancer.  Can't believe I actually got ball cancer.  He's just like 14.  He's playing the guy's going to say something. 
[02:44:30]  Like, oh, my God.  Really?  Yeah.  But it's just not happening.  It's like the real version of the catchphrase guy.  I'll dip my balls in it.  When Ant and I were able to do prank calls, you're not really allowed to do it anymore, I guess.  Stalking laws, right?  Yeah.  We would try something maybe similar to this.  This would just be thrown in the trash.  Like, all right, that one didn't work.  You try.  You fish.  You keep fishing until you get one.  It's called fishing.  That's really good.  You try to get something, and usually it doesn't work out.  So he should have saved his ball cancer thing for the next person to call, and try it again,  and maybe you'll get the reaction you were hoping for. 
[02:45:00]  If he says ball cancer enough times, maybe it'll work.  We should count how many times he says ball cancer in this thing.  You don't want me to start over, though, do you?  No.  Okay.  It ain't funny.  The way you're saying it makes it sound humorous, but I know it's not.  You keep laughing.  You say it's not funny, but I mean, for God's sake, I'm dying of nut cancer here.  Well, what's the treatment for that?  I don't know.  Probably cut my balls off.  Oh, I don't think it's quite that extreme.  I don't know what they'll do. 
[02:45:30]  What do you think they're going to do?  Well, I'm thinking you'll do a little chemo-radiation combo treatment.  Well, come on, if the human body can't handle chemo, what do you think my balls are going  to do, man?  What, is all the hair on my balls going to fall off?  And here's the other problem, Double J.  I think we could critique him.  Are we critiquing him as experts in the field?  I think we've done some fine prank calls.  With such pranks under our belt as butt plug.  Butt plug.  And 100 grand.  And old Bill.  Old Bill.  Old Bill.  And the dead guy, Bill's dead. 
[02:46:00]  Bill's dead.  And quite a few prank phone calls.  See, Double J, when you're telling someone you have ball cancer, you shouldn't act like  a wacky DJ.  Right.  That's when you could use your normal voice.  Yeah.  These guys don't understand.  Every time this mic's on, they have to be wacky DJs.  Hey, how you doing?  I got the ball cancer.  I mean, at that point, you could use your regular voice, you know?  Dude, I got ball cancer.  You know, I'm not...  Yeah, yeah, a little bummed out about it.  I'm really not into what you're saying, because it's really bad.  I got ball cancer.  Right.  And I'm just freaked out about it. 
[02:46:30]  Hope you would get the telemarketer call.  Not yet.  Got the ball cancer.  And it wasn't a wacky DJ voice.  No.  No.  No.  Not in most cases.  That would be kind of funny, though, huh?  The new thing...  I got all the hair on my head, but no hair on my balls?  I'm sorry, man.  I'm trying to laugh about it, because I'm scared to death, you know?  Yeah.  Well, you need...  It is serious, but it's probably not going to be the end of the world for you. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know how soon they caught it, but they gave me an 85% probability that...  Yeah, you don't need to rub it in.  I got a 12% chance of living, is what they told me.  I got a 12% chance of living.  Chance of living, and you're our winner.  You're our seventh caller.  Same voice.  I got a 7%...  How many percent did he think?  7% chance of winning, or you just won a pair of tickets to Van Halen.  Right.  Or you're the 10th caller.  You'll receive a NAC prize package. 
[02:47:30]  A NAC prize package.  12%.  Yep.  I'm dying, man.  You know, I mean, I got...  Sheesh.  I just got a lot of cancer in my balls, you know?  All right, man.  Listen, I wish you the best.  And he's about to make the biggest mistake.  If you're going to be an asshole, be an asshole to the end.  Right.  No, no, I've not heard this call, but if someone tells me that he explains that he's only joshing,  I'm going to bite Steve's face. 
[02:48:00]  No.  Steve, run.  Uh, let's see.  How dare you.  Dan from Jersey, I would rather hear readings from Rent Boys.  That is bad.  I'd like to have that DJ read one.  I can't believe you cocked so big!  There I was, jacking it.  Jacking it?  Jacking it.  Hey, he's got a funky treasure back there.  Yeah, maybe we could get Double J to read from Rent Boys.  That's not a bad idea.  That would work.  Send him some Rent Boy pages, and then we'll have him read it as the DJ. 
[02:48:30]  All right, but here, if there's any, Chris from Willington, if there's any justice, this  idiot DJ will get lip cancer and finally shut off.  All right, man, listen, I wish you the best.  And I'm sure everything will be all right.  You need to get, you know, keep up with the doctor thing here.  Nick, stretch that out for you.  What was your name again?  My name's Doug.  Hey, Doug, I just want to tell you, man, I really don't have ball cancer.  You called the wrong phone number.  Double J. 
[02:49:00]  I just want to tell you, you didn't really, I don't have ball cancer.  You called the wrong number.  You called the Wacky Morning Crew.  Oh, Double J.  Double J.  You got to let him off the hook.  That's what the wacky DJs do.  His timing and delivery is worse than mine, I have to say.  Very good.  Thank you.  I don't understand why you tell him at the end. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know.  Well, he has a lot more stuff, so hopefully he'll send more things for us.  Let me tell you, you've been a victim of the crank call of the day.  Do you want more stuff from this guy?  Because I'll ask for as much as he can say.  Oh, please.  Where were you when I said I did?  You just said it.  Are you serious?  All right, fine.  Are you questioning Opie?  Not at all.  You really don't listen.  How long have you been in the studio?  Look at that sexy cover.  I heard everything.  I was just asking you to reiterate.  He says, this is just the tip of the iceberg of some stuff I got. 
[02:50:00]  If you guys would like, I'm more than willing to send you some other stuff as well.  Right.  And I pretty much said something like, yeah, we'd like to hear other things you have.  You did say that.  I heard it.  Joe heard it.  I know you said it.  I heard it.  I know you said it.  I was just trying to determine whether or not you were kidding.  Oh, shit.  His hat's on fire.  Maybe your hat's on fire.  It's kind of upsetting you.  There you go.  It's heating up your brain.  All right.  Well, that's Double J.  I mean, if there's other guys out there you want to send stuff in that you think's really  good, then we'll play it.  We'll give you credit. 
[02:50:30]  Thanks, Steve.  My pain is safe.  Anthony?  Mm-hmm?  Bill's dead.  Oh.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know. 
[02:51:30]  Where did it happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I got to go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:52:00]  No.  Oh, God.  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, God.  Opie.  Oh, God.  I'll bring you a little.  Now, clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy? 
[02:52:30]  Because that's how we fix it with tape.  Because if your glasses break, you put a piece of tape.  If the taillight breaks on the car, piece of tape.  One night I didn't have a condom. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, God.  Don't go home and try that shit either.  All right.  you know people should laugh  if that's good for you  the problem is  you can't go out  and see a comedian

[02:57:30]  Never let him off the hook  No  I'm sure there's audio  of us letting someone  off the hook somewhere  but in general  we never let anyone  off the hook  I hope not  If you tell someone  something in a prank call  and they say  thanks for telling me that  I'm now going to go  smother my infant  you still shouldn't  let him off the hook  Let him do it  Yep  Yum  Let him do it  If you see someone  going down a comedic road  and it's an obvious dead end  and he just keeps talking  Let him go  Let him  bury himself deeper

Let's give it a list then  I always have to explain  that this happened  a really long time ago  Oh, don't make excuses  Because now that  even though it's a tape  people still want  to hurt me  over this call  What are you going to do?  It is the holiday season  I guess we can start  playing this again  Sure is  Now just keep in mind  this was seven  maybe eight years ago  and the kid's got to be  pretty old now  Is it that long ago? 
[02:58:30]  Wow  The kid officially  doesn't believe in Santa Claus  Right  The kid doesn't care anymore  He feels ridiculous  that he ever did  He's discovering Nirvana  at this point  Kurt Cobain is now his hero  Really?  Yeah, I'm sure  All the kids are discovering  Kurt Cobain, Anthony  I think you have a little  guilt for this  A little bit  I just don't want  a beer bottle  to hit me in the back  of the head  as I walk home today  Oh, it's old news  Yeah, I was just listening  to your station  a little while ago  Yeah  And I had my  three-year-old son with me 
[02:59:00]  and you guys were  putting down  the Santa Claus thing  and oh, it's just  your parents  and all that  Yeah  And I was  I love Opie and Anthony  and I'm a faithful listener  but I had to change  the station  Oh, that's okay  You're doing parenting  that's called  when you change the station  Yeah  Wait, wait  I detect that  you're a little pissed  at us  because we just said  that there's no  Santa Claus on the air  Well, it'd be one thing  if it was a little  later at night  and there wouldn't happen  to have been  someone's kid listening  you know  Dude, I'd just save you 
[02:59:30]  the hassle  Now you can get the credit  for all those presents  you bought for him  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't actually  I changed the station  in time  where he didn't pick up  on it  because he was busy  doing something else  Hey, what's your son's name?  It's Jeffrey  Can I talk to him real fast?  Why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him  You're not going to say  anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah  I hope not  Alright, where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him 
[03:00:00]  He don't really talk  much on the phone  What's your wife  saying in the background?  She wasn't too happy  about it when I told her  She wasn't listening  But wait, wait  Chill out  Okay, Jeffrey  Somebody wants to talk  to you on the phone  Those guys we were  listening to on the radio?  He's got a measuring tape  He said he's measuring  the floor first  And your wife  is mad at me  for doing that?  I better talk to him  and then smooth it over  Okay, well  here he is 
[03:00:30]  Okay, I'll give him  the phone  but I don't know  He'll talk  Alright  Okay, here he is  Here, Jeffrey  Listen  Listen to this guy  on the radio  He wants to talk to you  Here  Jeffrey  Take it  Come here  Come here  Wait  Let me get him  on my lap  Jeffrey, come here  Come here  Just listen to what  this guy has to say  to you  Jeffrey, there's no  Santa Claus  Jeffrey, there's no  Santa Claus  That's your dad  Hey man, the kid's 11 now 
[03:01:00]  12 maybe  It sounded the same  as the Bill's Dead  woman  Anyway, we're back  Lovely  See, double J  How you doing?  There'll be shocking news  coming out of the  entertainment world  Yeah, this is a  Shocking  This is a huge surprise  Yeah  There was  I guess 
[03:01:30]  an award show  last night  that was on  the  American Music Awards  I guess that was on  Yeah  And I guess  aside from  what's her name  Anna Nicole Smith  I guess everything  went pretty smooth  Right?  No big troubles  No big problems  Well in Santa Monica  they had the  The Vibe Award  taping  They tape it  because they  can't  put this show  on live  Although they should  it would be the  top rated show  ever, ever, ever 
[03:02:00]  No one has the balls  to put it on live  though  No one has the balls  to put this on live  You couldn't put it on live  There would be all kinds  of FCC violations  just for language alone  That would be the fun part  But  Again, Opie  I kind of remember  this happening  This is like  deja vu  A fight broke out  near the stage  at the Vibe Awards  What's going on  with the Vibe Awards?  What is the difference  between the Vibe Awards  or any other award show? 
[03:02:30]  Melanin  Jesus  A fight broke out  near the stage  of the Vibe Awards  ceremony  as Snoop Dogg  and producer  Quincy Jones  were preparing  to honor  Dr. Dre  and one person  was stabbed  authorities and witnesses  said  So now  Dr. Dre  is going to be honored  It's not  I guess  an award  He's getting  an honor award  like some kind  of a legend award 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, probably  like a lifetime  achievement award  Right  Guy's been in hip hop  This is like  I don't know  Chuck Heston  coming out on the stage  for an Oscar  lifetime achievement award  or  I don't know  Dr. Dre goes way back  though, yo  Paul McCartney  coming out  for a Grammy award  lifetime achievement award  So here you go  It's a guy  that's  He's no kid  in the business  Guy's been in the business  for many years  He invented  He invented  He  I invented 
[03:03:30]  Rap music  He discovered Snoop  Yep  Discovered Snoop  And he was  instrumental  as far as  the West Coast  rap goes  Anthony  There's all the  Eminem stuff  Well of course  and he continues today  helping out Eminem  N.W.A.  Making Eminem legit  I might add  Founding member  Because if Eminem  had white people  behind him  he wouldn't be  as popular  as he is  Dr. Dre makes  the black community  accept Eminem  Yep  Dissed Eazy-E 
[03:04:00]  and forgave him  on his deathbed  Right  Eazy-E  Dozens of people  sitting near the stage  Monday inside a hangar  at Santa Monica  Municipal Airport  That's where they  hold their award shows  Okay  Began shoving each other  as the show  wound down  about 7.30  Now I guess  the show's  winding down  Now it's time  to you know  it's time to  pay up some debts  A photographer  who covered the event  said  things started  winding down  about 7.30 
[03:04:30]  News video shows  chairs  being thrown  punches flying  people chasing  one another  and some being  restrained  If you haven't seen  the video for this  you gotta tune in  the news  It's a melee  They're playing  My favorite part  is the cop  that doesn't  want to totally commit  but kind of  jumps in the melee  for a second  and sprays  it looks like  pepper spray  or something  At anybody  And then just  jumps back out  Yeah  He just jumps in  sprays  jumps out  Chairs thrown  you can see  punches thrown  The only thing 
[03:05:00]  that can be  possibly more  embarrassing  and worse  is the Dallas  defense  Nice job  last night  Dallas  It was unclear  if the stabbing  proceeded or  followed the  fight  Victim  26 year old  man taken  to the hospital  No arrests  were made  Witness Frank  Williams  told KCALTV  that Dr. Dre  was involved  in the brawl  I saw Dr. Dre  fighting somebody  Williams said  I don't know 
[03:05:30]  if he was  fighting back  but there was  a guy taken  out  basically bloodied  Dr. Dre  should not be  fighting  at award shows  I can understand  some young  up and comers  I don't remember  you can take  the out of the  but you can't  take the out of  what  I'm not done yet  keep going  Dr. Dre  who was scheduled  to receive  a Vibe Legend  Award  okay  Vibe Legend 
[03:06:00]  Award  for his lifetime  contributions  to hip hop  had not come  to the stage  yet when the  fight erupted  Jones and Snoop Dogg  stood on stage  without saying  anything  I would think  Snoop would just  fucking like  duck  I'm amazed  Snoop is still  alive at this  point  seems like he's  got people that  don't like him  all over the  place  I know  and he's  got to be  you know  when something  breaks out  you might think  you know  buck buck  might be some  gunfire headed  your way  Snoop  I remember it  by the way  the old  expression  oh yeah 
[03:06:30]  you can take  the golfer  off the course  but you can't  take the course  out of the  golfer  there you go  about a thousand  people attended  the event  some scurried  for the exits  when the melee  began  it's really  important  here it is  it's really  important that  we don't take  a negative  incident like  this and do  away with the  awards  Suge Knight  told reporters  before he hung  someone out a  window  to get residuals  that was  vanilla  you know 
[03:07:00]  people can  say what  they want  when white  people comment  on these  things  it comes  off sounding  very racist  it comes  off sounding  very stereotyping  that we're  stereotyping  but the truth  of the matter  is  if you're  a self  respecting  black man  you have  to hate  when things  like this  happen  because it's  fuel  for racists  to look  and say  see  this is  what it's  all about  but then  see  this is 
[03:07:30]  what it's  all about  what are  you doing  are you  speaking as  the racist  or as  Anthony  there  I'm playing  the racist  advocate  but it's  not  it was an  isolated  incident  but then you  got you know  Jay-Z's people  pepper spraying  R. Kelly  who does that  at a concert  Metallica  just toy with  God's mouth  did Sully  blast Hetfield  on the way up  I mean  it doesn't  happen  anywhere  but there  you know  who does that  people that  want their  names in the  news  I'm sorry  I'm shutting 
[03:08:00]  up  I don't  think you  should shut  up  I don't  think it's  about news  I was going  to say  Whitey has  done that  too  the actual  fights were  legendary  those guys  went out  a fist fight  between two  guys that are  a couple of  faggots anyway  him and Vince  Neal didn't like  each other  they would duke  it out  that's different  than Pepper  spraying or  a chair  throwing and  a knife  incident at  the stage  at the stage  there's a  stabbing here  there's people  punching each  other  it's a melee  Rolling Stones 
[03:08:30]  concert there  was a stabbing  that's it 1968  was it the  Hells Angels  first of all  are bikers  you're trying to  say the blacks  behave differently  than the whites  no not at all  I wouldn't say  that I mean I  would never  criticize the  rap community  there's been some  crazy white  melees  there's a whole  thing about the  rap community  where a community  the fact that  we call it a  community is  ridiculous  that these  thugs  the rap  sublock  well why don't  we talk to our  golfer expert  Earl  were you at the 
[03:09:00]  Vibe Awards  Earl  hell no  Earl wouldn't be  seen near it  believe me  I got some sense  it's Earl everyone  the whitest black  guy we know  oh behave  easy with those  retorts  I know you have  no gangsta in you  whatsoever  oh behave  there's a thing  where these guys  supposedly came from  these roots of  violence and  gangs  and in order to  get any street  cred they have to  act like it's 
[03:09:30]  still going on  regardless of  their millions of  dollars regardless  of the lifestyles  they lead they  still want to be  recognized and  looked at like  they're slinging  dope on the  corners  these guys are  living large man  I've seen cribs  of course  these guys are  living large  it's a joke  part of that  is if somebody  steps on your  foot and gives  you a look and  doesn't apologize  instead of blowing  it off and  acting like  civilized human  beings you have  to kill the  person you have 
[03:10:00]  to shoot them  stab them or  beat them down  into submission  because that's  the way you get  respect you know  what you get you  don't get respect  you get shunned by  the civilized world  you get shunned by  the rest of the  country that  doesn't believe  you should shoot  people for  stepping on your  foot or saying  you're an asshole  Mike from Jersey  wants to know  was there a gun  check instead of  a coat check at  these awards  there you go  so go ahead  Earl  you get your 
[03:10:30]  ticket you hand  them your  Uzi hang it up  what is there to  say you get a  bunch of fools  into one  oh I was  hoping you were  going to say  the word  you paused  and everything  and then you  turned it into  fools  as a black  man  how do you  feel  I know  figured it out  I just found  out myself  how does it  feel for a black  man who's  trying  you know  you lead your  life as a  very respectful  human 
[03:11:00]  I believe  you know  the guy  even though  he's been  fired  he still  goes to  work  every day  doesn't mean  he doesn't  even have a  job there  and he still  goes to  work  that's  unusual  what an  outstanding  guy  but doesn't  it upset  you that  the stereotypes  just keep  going and  going because  of instances  like this  oh absolutely  it's embarrassing  it is embarrassing  there you go  it is absolutely  you can't get a  group of black  young black  men to sit  in one place  for three hours 
[03:11:30]  without a gunshot  being fired  this is what  and you know  something  90% of  whitey  that reads  this  they read  the story  and go  well they say  a couple of  words  one starts  with F  one starts  with N  and that's  what they  say  well you just  shrug your  shoulders  and you  yep  there they  go  sorry  sorry  suds  nobody  was shocked  reading this 
[03:12:00]  nobody  personal messages  I'm doing  now  nobody  was surprised  yeah  because he  wants me  to stop  tapping  oh were you  tapping again  yeah so  sorry suds  I dropped the pen  go ahead  and I'm sorry  well it's just  it makes people  it makes people  just say  what they're  thinking when  they read  stuff like that  Jerry Lee Lewis  and Charlotte  you know we were  talking about  the stabbing  at the stone  show  we all know  it was because  they hired  the hell's  you know  the hell's  angels  to run security  at Altamont  that would be  like hiring  the bloods 
[03:12:30]  to run security  for the vibe  awards  he makes a good  point  there you go  and a violent  outbreak in a  giant arena  like that  or outdoor  event  which happened  in the late  60s  you can't compare  with the front  of the stage  at an award  show  everybody's wearing  suits  it's supposed to be  professional people  filming for television  coming in here  and honoring  each other  with their own  award show  and that's just  it  now black people  decided they wanted  their own award show  vibe awards  and fine  go ahead  but shouldn't you 
[03:13:00]  make sure it's  one of the most  respectful award  shows  that you put it  on  and pay tribute  to black  entertainers  it's not  just that it  happens at an  all black  award show  makes people  look and go  ah  see  I just love  the fact that  the entertainment  industry makes  them hold the  award show  next to the  Roswell craft  in some  airline hangar  somewhere  motherfucking alien  autopsy going on 
[03:13:30]  next door  what's up  I think I should  give it all back  to Don Cornelius  and the Soul Train  awards  yeah there you go  now you never saw  anything bad happen  nothing ever bad  happen  Don Cornelius  the big afros  hey brother Joe  I gotta ask you  something  yes  are we really  boring today  or is your band  just tired  no  we came back  from Massachusetts  I know the band  is asleep  on the couch  it's kind of a buzz  kill  I keep looking over  like I think we're  having a pretty good  show and these  guys are snoring  on our lesbian  why is Bono  asleep on our couch  the funny thing is

[03:15:30]  five empty stockings  hey did you make the news  was it Christmas at the Petersons  that guy was  two people away from me  there was Access Hollywood  and then the Fox people  Jamie Lee Curtis  gets cranky  here's a good rule  to live by  don't ask Jamie Lee Curtis  too many questions  or any questions at all  if possible  she's no charmer  that's for sure  try ice cold  who knew  I met her last night  at the lavish premiere  for her lackluster  new holiday comedy  Christmas with the Cranks  which is about  a middle aged couple  who are ostracized  by their neighbors 
[03:16:00]  when they decide  to skip the holiday  and go on a cruise  Anthony  I was standing there  I bet at the end  of the movie  they finally realize  how good Christmas is  enjoying the whole community  and celebrating  you're probably right  yeah  singing one of those  la la la  yeah  manga  in the town square  maybe not though  because Bad Santa  started a new trend  last year  or maybe everybody else  in the community  realizes that they're Jews  and then just ostracize 
[03:16:30]  them for that as well  I was standing near Jamie Lee, yikes  All I asked was what she'd be working on next  When Jamie Lee exclaimed in response  Nothing, nothing, no more movies  No more, I can't do it anymore  I'm a mother, I've got to concentrate on my kids  She said  At that point, if looks could have killed  Yours truly would have been six feet under  What was I going to do?  Jamie Lee's co-star Tim Allen was much better  When his publicist tried to advance the idea that Allen say hello  He walked away  Even the publicist shrugged, what can you do?  These fucking stars 
[03:17:00]  They are the worst  That's why we don't want these people on our show  Even though they're trying to get us to get A-list celebrities on the program  If they wouldn't behave that way in the studio  They'd get abused horribly  But this is truly, you're right  You bring up a great point  This is why we don't want these people on our show  They're awful when they come in here  And we've had a couple  They come in with their publicist  They don't want to say boo  Not two words  They plug what they got going and then they're out  They're no fun  So screw them 
[03:17:30]  You should have asked Jamie Lee Curtis  What gender did your parents think you were when you were born?  You know, both genitals  Freak  I'm sure she would have answered happily  Is that really true?  Or is that a gash or a cock?  I don't know, I've heard  That's the thing that they've been talking about forever  I don't know if she has both  Or if she just has a big clitoris or a hermaphrodite type  That's what I kind of hope she has  Like a fist in her panties  You've got to give her the cans she had in Trading Places  When she takes her shirt off in front of Dan Aykroyd 
[03:18:00]  And then she covers him up and slams the door in his face  Great set  Great scene  Now she's cranky I think because she's losing all that  Of course she is  It's affecting her  And her whole mindset now when she does do interviews  And actually speaks  Is that she's accepting the fact that she's just another middle-aged woman  You know what?  That she's accepting her body and everything  That's bullshit  It is bullshit  She is not accepting it  She's very bitter  She wants to come across that she's accepting it  She's miserable  Has to look at that sagging face in the mirror every freaking morning  Yeah  And just like anyone else on this planet 
[03:18:30]  It bothers her  It bugs her  Of course it does  And she's going out of her way to tell people how much it doesn't bother her  She did a photo shoot in what magazine was that?  Where she had no makeup on  No makeup on  No doctoring to the photos  And it was her  Right  It was just a way of getting her name out there again  She's trying a little too hard  These celebrities  They'll do anything to get their names out there  Yes  And that was her in for a while  What?  We took some photos at the event last night  Steve's going to have them on the website in a little bit  She has her hair cut  That really dykish haircut  Yeah  Super short 
[03:19:00]  Spiked  And it's silver  It's not even gray  Silver  It was reflecting light  She had some kind of paint done to her hair  And Eric  When did she ever have long hair?  No  I mean this is almost like G.I. Jane kind of  But she's always had that hair  But she's always had that hair  When she was younger  It was kind of like pixie-ish  Right  And with that body  It was fine  Now she looks like the gym teacher  Like Christopher Guest has to just be going  What the fuck?  What did I matter?  It's your fucking wife, okay?  You can't play the guitar anymore  Well, Eric is our go-getter on this radio show 
[03:19:30]  Sex Bagel  And he calls out of the blue and says  Dude, I think I'm going to get into the  On the red carpet  For the world premiere of Christmas with the Cranks  He had no credentials or nothing  No credentials?  He was just walking by and said  You know what?  I'm going to give this a shot  And see what I can make out of this  A mere block or so away  There's machine gunners at the Christmas tree  And you get in with no security  Well, this area was also surrounded by military personnel  There were some Marines and Army men there  Doing the toys for tots  Which is funny, by the way  Because all these celebrities and their families 
[03:20:00]  Are coming down the red carpet with toys  But the guys with the machine guns  They just looked at your frosted hair  And go, ah, he's alright  Yeah  He won't be a problem  They let you be  He's a good boy  You want to play  This is how he snuck in  Well, snuck in  He talked his way into the thing  It's pretty impressive  He said on 6th  So we go around the 6th  Press check in  Excuse me  Press check in  Where is it?

And it came back to New York  And it was just thrown out  At this last minute  I forgot the name  And you wait for her to go like  Mary?  And then you go  Yeah, Mary  It bounced, you said  It bounced from D.C. back  It bounced  I know, using the technical jargon 
[03:22:00]  I heard another publicist said it  So I was like  That works  Bounce  Some corporate lingo  Yeah, they were probably saying  Would you bounce that guy out of here?  He obviously doesn't belong  And then he moved this right up to the front  Ice  Whatever got you in  What did you have to record with?  Some portable DAT recorders  Okay, so you have to  Put the little XM logo on the mics  That's it  Oh, cool  That's all they saw  Mic flags  All right  And then you talk to a lot of people  I don't know  Start with number nine  McFoley  All right  Here's our old pal McFoley, Anthony  What was he doing there?

He was just hanging  He was escorting some contest winner  You know that  He does  He lives Christmas all year long, Anthony  All year long  I think he  You say it in the thing  He explains it  Why is that?  But I think that room that he has  Is all year long  Yeah, it's his basement  He converted his basement  To like a huge holiday house  Why?  And he has it all year long  He's a crazy person  Mick Foley  Wrestling Lengen  How you doing, my man?  How you doing, Mick?

No the guy next door  The guy right next to me  He said the same exact thing  I was trying to see  If he'd say the same speech  He was giving the other guy  He said you look fantastic  How do you stay so fit?  And he was just repeating  Word for word  Everything he did on the  What?  You told Dan Aykroyd  He looks fantastic?  Just because the guy  Right next to me was going  You're fantastic  Dude he's a bloated mess  I saw him at the  Saturday Night Live  After party a couple weeks ago  No he doesn't look so good  Not too fantastic?

[03:40:00]  The fantastic one?  Maybe he meant  He does fit in well  You look fantastic  Fantastic  While I walked here tonight  Was that him saying  Fantastic?  Fantastic  Fantastic  Maybe he meant  He looks like a van  Because he's so big now  And bloated  I'm waiting for my  Entire family  I'm bullshitting  I don't know where they are  You're going to maybe  Break out a little  Harmonica Christmas song tonight?

[03:41:00]  Let's hope you  But I would never get away  What a fucking putz  He turned into  What happened to  Fred Garvin  Male prostitute  And the  Bass-O-Matic guy  And all those  Great characters  From the early  Saturday Night Live  And then they just  Turn into  Chevy Chase  And Dan Aykroyd  Of Now  And  The only lucky ones  Are the ones  That are dead  Is that how you  Blue she got out  At the right time?  Totally dead  Hartman  Soda Dog  Gilda Ratner  Gilda, sure 
[03:41:30]  He should have  Killed that character  After Blue she died too  What is he doing?  Oh, they  What did they  Because he has  Nothing else  To go with  So he  Let him do serious works  He can act  He's a decent actor  Let him do serious roles  What is Jim doing, man?  That was his brother's gig  That's awful  I just never understood  Why they kept that going  After John died  That's horrible  You need money that bad?  Yeah  And then Aykroyd  Try to play Bill Murray  In Caddyshack 2 as well  Let's not forget  That was on the other day  I'm like, why is he imitating  Can't sit through that 
[03:42:00]  Why is he trying to imitate  Bill Murray?  Why doesn't he just  Come up with another character  For Caddyshack 2?  That was problem number 800  With that movie  Oh, I understand  Caddyshack, the original  We've said it  Caddyshack 2 is the worst  Sequel ever made  Worst sequel ever made  What's his name?  The comic that they had on there?  Jackie Mason  Jackie Mason  Is trying to do a Rodney impression  Right  He's trying to be the wacky comic  Like Rodney Dangerfield was  In Caddyshack  They couldn't get the guys back  So then they get  Excuse me  Other people to play those roles  It was ridiculous  Chevy just pocketing a paycheck 
[03:42:30]  Right  It was horrible  It is the most unfunny movie ever  Coming off, you know  One of the funniest movies ever  Yeah  Ugh  Mr. Gopher  Oh, that was horrible  That was one of the worst scenes  In movie history  We should play that tomorrow  It's such a  How hard would it be  A moment  How hard would it be  To find that scene  From Caddyshack 2  With Dan Aykroyd  With Dan Aykroyd  Putting that stupid voice on  Mr. Gooper  And then doesn't he have a  Someone has to suck the poison 
[03:43:00]  Out of his butt  Or something  Oh, God  You've got to suck it out  Oh  Is the Tim Allen worth playing?  Not really  Why?  I mean, there's nothing really special  He just mumbles on about  You know  How much he loves doing movies now  Instead of television  Because the schedule's better  But nothing really  I'd like to hear that  That's brand new information  From celebrities  They never say that  And this is A-list celebrities  On the Opie and Anthony show  A-list  Eric works for the show  And he's not  And he talks to A-list celebrities  You're right  This is finally A-list  This will calm Washington down 
[03:43:30]  This is the beauty  We're going to get  When we start getting them  In studio  Yeah  What?  What did I say?  The beauty  Okay  What?  The special  I couldn't get it in  And Joe said  I'll slot it  And at the same time  Jamie Lee Curtis  Wants to do it with you  Dan Aykroyd  Dan Aykroyd  Tim Allen's right here  We're going to  The publicity's going to  Pull them away  We're going to try to get  Don't tell him that story  Because he said  It's a Grisham book  And it was amazing  The opportunity  How do you  Sorry  How do you say in shape  You look great  Actually I'm training  Pretty heavily 
[03:44:00]  Because the movie  Follow Shaggy  I play an old superhero  And they want me  Pretty buffed  How's it looking  In the mirror these days?  Well  At my age  As long as I don't  Look too close  But my eyesight's not so good  So  With the glasses  With the glasses off  I look pretty darn good  I'll just  Keep my glasses out of my hands  What do you do  I don't really get so crazy  At the holidays  I plan a year out  With gifts  I love  She didn't say  What do you do  To rebound from the holidays  Did she?  As in like  You know  You eat a little too much  What do you do  To get back into shape?  Oh my god 
[03:44:30]  No she probably meant mentally  Like you know  The holidays are so crazy  What do you do  To get back  On track?  Just a soft  Awful question  Nothing  I travel a lot  So I buy little things  For my family  And when it goes  By the time it's over  I kind of miss  You seem to take a beating  A lot  In this movie  This was me not reading  The script real closely  One more question  And he gets  Your movies are doing very well  Any plans to return back  To television in the future?  I played around with it  This year with Carsey Warner 
[03:45:00]  We did a pilot  And I got my feet wet  Kind of liked it  But at this point  I love the schedule  I like the way movies work  You know  Time on  Time off  I have a design  And fabrication work  I've got TimEllen.com  I love my website  I'm a computer geek  Gives me time to play  Yeah  Gives me time to play with that  So movies you're on for  Two hours  And you're off for six  And on  I like the schedule  Can you say hi to our friends  Greg and Tony?  Hi Greg and Tony  Thanks man  Appreciate it  At this point too  Dan Aykroyd is being interviewed 
[03:45:30]  Right on the other side of us  But while Tim is talking  The publicists won't let Tim  Be interviewed individually  They said you all got to do a group  So everyone has all their microphones  Up to Tim  And they got to shout out their questions  Dan is leaning like this  While he's doing his interview  Over to the mics where Tim is  Trying to get what he's saying there  Onto their audio as well  To kind of overshadow  What Tim is saying as well  Oh really?  Yeah  Did you say during that exchange  With Tim Allen  That you two are into the internet  Or something like that  Did anyone else pick up on that? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah us two  Was that you?  He goes yeah us two  No  Like Tim would go  Who are you?  Eight or nine people altogether  No because he's talking about  How he's into the internet  And someone very excitedly said  Yeah us two  Who is it?  That was the internet at this point  I asked a television question  I wasn't there  You know?  Like oh my god  I can relate to you  I didn't think anyone  Would relate to me  You know  On this level  Point, click  Right  I do that  I like Doss prompt  All right  Eric very good  I like how Eric 
[03:46:30]  You gotta give him credit though  They said one more question  And he did barge right in there  He certainly did  Blurt that stupid television question out  The big disappointment was that  We saw Tony Danza on the list  And we were waiting  Never showed  All right bring in the drill though guys  They've been sitting out there forever  Good job sex bagel  Good job  Thank you  There he goes  A-list celebrities on the show  There we go  Keep trying  Can we play that song  Don't get disappointed  Nobody's calling me  He stays like these  Guy's working his ass off for us  Have a nice say  You did a good job  All right who are you guys? 
[03:47:00]  How you doing?  I'm Ryan  Hey Ryan what's up?  Who are you?  Hey Jim  And what do you got for the show today?

[03:48:00]  It's just flopping around  Right now  But I think if it was  Sheathed  Inside a vat  Yeah I think it might just  It'll keep it straight and true  Is that on a blade?  Well yeah  Yeah it's  No teeth on it  So if the dildo slipped  Off  Somehow  That would  Go right into her  That could be the most  Dangerous thing I've ever seen  That is a hazard  What is he going to say  On the box?  Good for an orgasm  Slash hysterectomy?  Yeah  If that blade pulled out 
[03:48:30]  With that thing going  Back and forth so quickly  You wouldn't be able to  Move it out of the way  Fast enough  Before she's impaled  On a sawzall blade  Maybe she'd worn  Some discomfort perhaps  Ahead of time  Can I see that?  Yes absolutely  I like it as an idea  But as a product  Yes flick it to there  And you gotta hold it  And pull at the same time  Take the safety off  Hold it and pull?
