<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – along with Ronnie B, discussing humorous anecdotes about their children sleeping in their beds, detailing various forms of accidental physical assault from their offspring. This led to a nostalgic discussion about their childhoods, touching on party lines, sneaking around, and the drinking cultures of Long Island and Philadelphia.  A shocking 911 call from *Seinfeld* actor Daniel Von Bargen, who had shot himself in the head but survived, was played and dissected, focusing on the call’s bizarre and nonchalant tone and Von Bargen’s admission of soiling himself.  The conversation then shifted to suicide attempts, referencing a documentary about Golden Gate Bridge jumpers, before transitioning to a discussion about the physical toll of factory work and the potential health risks of electronic radiation.  The movie *Caddyshack*, Rodney Dangerfield, and actor Paul Lowe were briefly mentioned.  The show promoted upcoming appearances by Jim Norton and Kevin Pollack, teased a story from Troy that amused Roland, and concluded with a nonsensical, humorous skit.

The show continued with a segment that began with a nonsensical bit involving Eminem.  Opie recounted breaking E-Rock’s work phone due to its malfunctioning keypad.  This transitioned into a discussion of their office situation, their company history, and their dislike for certain colleagues. Ronnie B participated, sharing his feelings about the radio business and his aversion to company phones.  The upcoming presidential debate was discussed, with the hosts criticizing Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum's perceived hypocrisy regarding Catholicism.  The conversation expanded to include the architecture of St. Patrick's Cathedral, the hosts’ views on religion, and criticism of Romney and Santorum's perceived inauthenticity. A graphic and detailed story from Troy about a party at his apartment involving multiple men, a woman, various sex toys, and E-Rock's unwitting participation, was recounted.  This portion included explicit sexual descriptions and discussed E-Rock's past unhappiness and self-destructive behavior.  The segment ended with promotion of Opie's stand-up special in Cleveland and further discussion of the Cleveland music scene and the band Rush.

A lengthy interview with Troy followed, detailing outrageous stories from his band’s past, focusing on another band member, Eric.  These stories involved excessive partying, property damage (including trashing Eric's house and throwing things into his hot tub), equipment theft from a college radio station, and branding an 11-year-old girl with a heated coat hanger.  Troy described Eric as nerdy and needy.  The conversation also covered their attempts to manipulate CMJ charts and the band's breakup due to financial disputes.  Comedian Ron Bennington then joined the show, recounting a near-fatal chicken wing eating contest with Don Vito that resulted in temporary brain death for Vito.  They discussed the hardships faced by musicians and actors, referencing Jerry Lewis and the Martin and Lewis comedy team.  The hosts discussed the future of bands and the possibility of franchising acts like Kiss.  The segment concluded with promotion for Kevin Pollack’s performances and podcasts.

A lengthy, explicit discussion about the Fleshlight sex toy ensued, with Danny providing details about its creation and sharing anecdotes from a factory tour. The conversation included explicit descriptions and humorous tangents on failed product ideas. Pollack announced a new live comedy podcast, "Talkin' Walken," and shared stories about meeting Christopher Walken and Jack Nicholson.  He also promoted his stand-up appearances and discussed Jeremy Lin's popularity in China.  Uncle Nino was promoted for his Broadway show, "Bad Jokes and Wine," with clips played on air. The hosts and guests discussed the differences between radio and podcasting, focusing on monetization and audience reach.

The show continued with another conversation with Kevin Pollak, promoting his book ("Secrets and Lies from Life in the Biz") and the film "Columbus Circle."  Pollak discussed the challenges of comedy in film, using examples from his career and other films.  He shared anecdotes about working with Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.  The conversation touched on the difficulty of maintaining daily radio show quality compared to podcasting, with the hosts contemplating shortening their show.  They discussed movie experiences, including Pollak's reaction to a film with an older audience, and their own movie reactions. They also discussed their upcoming plans, including a "big announcement" downplayed by Ron Bennington, and future guest Jim Jefferies.  Post-show conversation focused on past guest booking mishaps with Jeff Garland, Norm MacDonald, Anthony Michael Hall, David Tyree, Victoria Gotti, and Mike Rowe, detailing various issues encountered with these guests.  The conversation concluded with scheduling discussions and banter with the show’s staff, including mentions of sandwiches and arrangements for the next day’s show.

The final segment featured a dispute between Opie and Mars, with Sal revealing he feeds Mars basketball information before the show.  This led to insults, including Opie calling Sal a "faggot."  The price of Knicks tickets, particularly courtside seats near Woody Allen, was debated. A phone call from former guest Paul McCurrio followed, scheduling his return for the next day.  A call from Tom from White Plains detailed a near-death experience and past interactions with the show, including a previously unmentioned firearm incident.  This led to discussions about the afterlife and Tom’s health concerns.  The hosts discussed J.R. Smith's hairstyle and basketball skills, speculating about Knicks trades.

FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Ronnie B in the house.  Ronnie B in the house.  This is nice.  We've already done an hour of radio. 
[00:01:30]  We should just turn the mics on.  See what works and then just throw it on the air.  Well, 99% of what you say, you don't want anybody to hear that.  Do you really want anybody to hear that shit?  I don't care anymore.  No, I don't care at this point.  Yeah.  Put it all on the air.  No more filters whatsoever.  We talked about my kid waking me up in the middle of the night because he hook noses me.  And Ronnie had a good theory on that.  Irish kids.  Irish kids are the worst, right?  Always go for a hook.  They'll hook the mouth.  They'll hook the ear. 
[00:02:00]  They'll hook the eyeball.  Anytime that you fight an Irish guy, you're going to end up scratched.  As well as either headbutt it and then some kind of hook in your mouth.  A hook in the mouth.  No, what is he, sleeping with you?  Is that the deal?  Yeah.  Is that bad?  He's almost two.  Oh, jeez.  Come on, man.  We're kind of lame, man.  We kind of like it.  But we're aware that we've got to take care of the situation.  But the thing is...  We're very aware.  Right, but you have a single bed and the three of you are just fucking crammed in there. 
[00:02:30]  This isn't healthy.  We've got the nice king size.  The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  We've got the big king size bed.  But we're fully aware we've got to get him in his own bed or crib, whatever.  At this point, it's probably a bed.  First of all, right now, just let him stay there until he's 18.  Right.  It just doesn't matter.  But we don't want to go through what they call the week of hell, where he's like, what  the fuck are you doing to me?  You don't love me anymore?  And he's going to have to scream all night for a week straight.  And we're not prepared for that.  You've got to get him... 
[00:03:00]  We're selfish.  Get a rocket ship bed or a...  Yeah, yeah.  A little car.  Oh, I wish I had this bed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're lucky.  But two nights in a row, two nights ago, I woke up because I got a heel to the head.  Right.  I think he's practicing MMA moves in the middle of the night.  So he sleeps in the middle?  In the middle.  Yeah, so he doesn't fall off the bed.  That's how we did that.  You probably snore.  It's probably not an accident.  He's probably...  He doesn't have to say, shut up.  So he just kicks you.  I got a heel to the fucking face.  That's a hell of a way to wake up in the middle of the night. 
[00:03:30]  And then last night, he went with the hook nose, man.  He's a strong fucker.  Like, when he wants something, he'll reach around.  He knows where my nostrils are.  He'll get his fingers in there.  And then yank as hard as he can to turn my head around to get my attention.  Dude, you need to read Oedipus.  He is sleeping next to your chick.  He's fucking trying to choke you to death while you're sleeping.  Shakespeare was in it this shit years ago.  You're in his bed fucking around with him and his chick.  That's where his head is right now.  You are the guy that when you're gone, everything will be great. 
[00:04:00]  We got to get him the hell out of there, huh?  Yeah.  Either that or you got to get out of there.  That's the deal.  And then the third, the trifecta, which I haven't talked about on the air yet, but we're going down this road.  The other night, I wake up.  I'm like, why am I awake?  Why am I awake?  And it's my wife sighing really loud.  She's pissed off.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  And then I smelled the oil refinery.  My farts were so bad.  I was waking up my wife, and she was exasperated, sighing really loud, which now woke me up. 
[00:04:30]  I'm like, my farts are so horrendous, they're waking her up in the middle of the night.  You don't even realize that you're doing it?  No.  I was deep in dreamland, man.  You're one notch away from pissing yourself right now.  It's that close.  You have no control over your body.  Well, my wife bought me crustables for Valentine's Day.  You know what a crustable is?  It's peanut butter and jelly sandwiches without the crust.  They're in little packages.  Sounds so good.  They're amazing. 
[00:05:00]  And I've been eating them like crazy, but I guess that causes some bad farts, all that peanut butter.  How big are they?  They're just little things.  You want to get some now?  No.  You want some crustables, Ronnie?  I don't understand.  And, like, it's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?  Yeah, it's like in a pita.  It almost looks like a pita, but it's a...  There it is.  But it's Wonder Bread.  You don't get the crust?  What a ripoff.  You don't get the crust, but they make their own crust because now they're keeping all the goodness inside,  so it doesn't push out the sides when you eat it.  So, technically, I feel like that's crust, so they should change the name. 
[00:05:30]  And the bread is fresh?  Real fresh, man.  I keep them frozen, and I put them in the toaster, so now you toast the outside, and it's still cold in the middle.  Somebody likes the little treats.  I love the Uncrustables, but they are causing farts and people to wake up in the middle of the night.  This is the thing that we've gotten so lazy that we won't spread peanut butter anymore.  Could someone spread this for me?  No, because my peanut butter is always too cold, so it just rips the bread.  It's a pain in the ass to make my own sandwich. 
[00:06:00]  So, you're eating peanut butter and jelly with no crust and sleeping next to a child.  Yes.  Yes.  You're in preschool.  I used to be a shock jock.  Yeah.  Remember when we were shock jocks?  Now you're just straight preschool.  You didn't have your kids in the bed, Ronnie?  Yeah, they did.  They probably still live there.  They're probably still there.  Yeah, come on in, everybody.  You sleep like fucking Eskimos.  Right.  Because this way, you can protect yourself from the outside world.  Right.  You just feel safe.  Yes.  The lights go down and everyone's just in their proper place.  Plus, nothing can make you... 
[00:06:30]  In your little nest.  Yeah, nothing can make you sleepier than when a kid falls asleep.  Right.  Because they just fall right out.  Don't you wish you could do that?  Yeah.  My kid will go from running around the house like a complete lunatic within two minutes out cold snoring.  I'm like, I would love to be able to do that.  Because there's no problems.  He has nothing to think about.  He's not thinking about the shitty boss or what's going on at work tomorrow.  He's just tired and that's it.  There's nothing to worry about.  You just turn off...  But didn't you think you had worries when you were a kid?  Didn't you think, like, I got some things concerning me? 
[00:07:00]  I don't remember.  I just thought it was normal that all the boys were doing what we were doing.  I didn't realize.  It wasn't.  Don't ask him any questions.  It wasn't.  Because he's got a flow chart that leads to molestation every time.  Right.  Every time.  I don't remember if I had issues or concerns.  I probably did as a kid, sure.  Right.  You're always like, everyone always thinks that they didn't have any worries.  But then you're like, I think that you do.  Like, kids will think stuff like, I hope my dad doesn't get fired or whatever the fuck.  But you just don't remember those things. 
[00:07:30]  You just, for some reason, act like everything was great.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, everyone either remembers that they had a really great childhood or a really rotten  childhood.  You don't really remember the boring times.  Or a lot of the specifics.  Yeah.  Wiped away.  What's really weird now is, like, when you go back and see your old friends that you grew  up with, they bring up stories like everything happened in one weekend.  They're like, remember that fucking weekend?  We fought those black guys.  We picked up those jigs.  We went to Wildwood.  You're like, I think that was like over seven years. 
[00:08:00]  That's such a good point, man.  But they, they all, everybody remembers it like it was just fucking crazy.  Right.  And I remember just constantly standing on a corner, fucking looking to see who's coming  by.  Like, please.  A lot of downtime.  Yeah.  Somebody fucking come by with a car so we can all pile in it.  Did you, uh, you think your parents had, had you in their bed?  No.  No fucking way.  Of course not.  We were born and we were thrown in a crib immediately.  Right?  Yeah.  My, I, I actually, I don't think I even went in my parents' room. 
[00:08:30]  No.  It was always like taboo and off limits.  Yeah, it was all fucking limits.  Remember when you'd walk in there when they weren't around and just take a look around and it  was just kind of a strange feeling.  Well, they kept the other phone there.  So that was where the second phone was.  You were lucky to have two phones going on.  Well, I didn't, I only had the one kitchen phone with the short thing that you just walk  back and forth on.  But then they had their own phone.  Wow.  We, we discussed that recently where it's so easy for kids to hook up and stuff because  they all have phones.  Right.  They get, they get sexed each other, sex thing and all that crap. 
[00:09:00]  We had to try to like, uh, work a girl in front of the rest of the family in the kitchen.  Right.  And you would try to pull the cord around the corner to try to get some privacy.  It's true.  And you're like, your dad would be like, who are you talking to?  Yeah.  It just, cause he knew it.  He just wanted to make, make it even more uncomfortable.  You just fucking all crawled over like a question mark.  Yeah.  Seriously.  So I'm really nice.  Yeah.  So we'll meet at the movies.  What do you think?  And then we'll fucking ditch the movies.  Yeah.  Do you have a party line or not? 
[00:09:30]  We had a party line.  Really?  Oh yeah.  Well, you'd pick up, we lived in, uh, in Edison.  It's a party line.  It's where you're sharing it with other apartments.  That's like honeymoon or shit.  That is like, we had a party line.  That's poor.  I think it's called a party line.  I thought I was poor.  Yeah.  Now.  We would pick it up.  It wouldn't be for us.  It'd be for the neighbors.  Or you'd pick it up and they'd be on the phone and you couldn't make your phone.  So you only had one phone for a bunch of apartments.  I don't know how many were on it, but I remember, uh, I can still remember the phone number.  And Ronnie's right.  That's honeymoon or shit.  What was your phone number?  I believe it was, uh, five, seven, two, two, seven, three, oh, but I, I, I, it's like  you recite through cadence when you're a kid, the numbers, you don't really know what they 
[00:10:00]  mean.  You just that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.  Yeah.  See, I remember when you even did, we did Hubbard five where there was just like everybody,  everybody had a fucking trunk.  And like, if you watch like Dick Van Dyke show and shit, they'll, they'll do stuff like  that.  Klondike five.  Six.  Of course.  Yeah.  What was the honeymoon?  What was their, uh, Bensonhurst six, Bensonhurst three.  I guess that was how you start a photo reflect.  But how did you know who the phone was for?  Did it have different rings?  It might have, but I don't remember. 
[00:10:30]  I don't remember how.  And I can remember picking up and hearing other people talking on it, but I don't remember  what the system was.  I was too young.  But you're not that old, man.  You, you must have the last party line.  That shit went out.  That's early seventies.  I mean, that's fucking CB radio.  It's really strange.  Yeah.  And then they can pick up the line and listen in on your conversations.  They could.  Yeah.  And you could, but you would hear somebody pick up.  I just don't remember.  I should ask my parents how that worked.  I don't remember anything better than we did finally get two phones and you try to  pick up that other fucking line to listen in a little bit. 
[00:11:00]  How cool was that?  Yeah.  That's, that's the fucking strangest thing in the world is just, you'll just know that  you're a scumbag.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You're just like, there's nothing you can do.  What are you going to do, man?  Uh, I had sex with a girl in my parents' bed.  They were away and I was, I was, I was an adult.  I was like 21 and I was living at home and I was dating this girl who worked for the silver  company and she was like 28 and hot Puerto Rican.  And, uh, I brought her home and we slept in my parents' bed together. 
[00:11:30]  It was really fucking creepy.  I don't know because I had my own, my room with kiss posters at 21.  Right.  She was way out of my league, but I don't know how I tricked her into dating me, but it was  really humiliating to have to bring a girl home and stay in my parents' room.  Did, didn't you try to like fake it?  Like I like Anthony furniture.  Early American.  That's what I've seen.  Yeah.  I just like these people.  I have photos of them.  No, it was really gross.  You smell your dad's like bad breath on the pillow and stuff.  I don't remember.  I just remember knowing I didn't belong in there. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  I didn't.  Yeah.  That's, that's really creepy.  I remember growing up if I, if I was sick, taking a sick day, you know, my mom would go,  yeah, you can sleep in our, you know, our bed and watch some TV.  And, uh, that was always like a comforting thing.  But besides that, man, it was all fucking limits.  Yeah.  The, uh, the thing is with me, if my parents like left, went away for the weekend, I just  took over the whole fucking house.  Yeah.  I just lived like this was my place.  Were you a party guy?  Yeah.  Were you brave enough to throw the parties?  If my, if my parents went to the fucking market, we were rolling a can in the back door. 
[00:12:30]  Just like, we're going to be here for 45 minutes.  Let's fucking go.  But all my friends were like that.  I wasn't brave enough until I was in college.  And then I would throw the parties at my parents' house in the summertime.  But before that, fuck, no, I was scared shitless.  I've never done that.  Yeah.  Like, I, that's too much stress.  Cause then you had to put the whole house back together.  Like, you know, the famous risky business, you know?  I say you just take your lumps when it's all over.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Just like, whatever.  Yes.  It happened.  This is terrible.  Why do you hate people in your space like that, though?  Like, I, I don't have people in my place now walking on your rug and shit. 
[00:13:00]  It's like, it wasn't, it wasn't our space.  It was our parents' space.  We didn't give a fuck.  You don't care about it then.  That's true.  It's just like some fucking stranger's house.  And there were always like responsible girls that would try to do the right thing and get  the house back in order for you.  But remember like when some fucking smart girl at school would have a party and you would  just go there and destroy her house?  Yeah.  And she'd be all fucking crying.  You're ruining my house!  Right.  Her fucking albums are all over the place.  No one gives a shit.  That's the fucking weirdest thing, though, is like, in my neighborhood, everybody was 
[00:13:30]  allowed to drink in their parents' cellar.  Like, if you just went down in the cellar.  That's a Philly thing.  You could fucking drink.  And then the parents would always be like, well, at least we know where they are.  Right, right, right.  They're not doing dope.  What do you think about that?  I, I, I will go along like people down in Philly just thought that drinking was somehow  you could not get high.  Right.  And drink.  Philly.  It was either or.  I've only been in the Philly culture for what, seven years now? 
[00:14:00]  And it seems like everyone started drinking really, a lot younger than I did in my neighborhood.  Not only that.  It was so acceptable to be drinking at 13, 14 years old.  I don't even know if they, if, if they could still get away with it, but you could go in  bars when you were in your like mid-teens.  Wow.  Down there.  If you go in and as long as you kept your shit together, you know, you didn't start yelling  and stuff.  Right.  As soon as you did, they threw you out.  Right.  You know, but if you just sat there and just fucking hit your beer.  What's that about you think?  Everybody left it out.  I, I think they, they're afraid that the kids will be pussies. 
[00:14:30]  So they just, you know what I mean?  Like they want to toughen them up early.  Right.  Because they get them in their first bar fight by 15.  That if the kid isn't doing those things, they're like, I don't know about him.  He's weird.  Yeah.  That's interesting.  That must be blue collar living.  I guess it is.  I, we were, I mean, we were middle class, but we didn't middle class neighborhood, but  we didn't have the middle class money, which was a strange thing for us.  So, but you, but did you feel like your, your, your friends and all, it was like a blue 
[00:15:00]  collar neighborhood where they, no, no, no, to be honest with you, that's, that's the,  uh, no, no, we were truly middle class, almost upper middle class.  I was just talking to Ken Marino from the state about this, this movie that he did about  Long Island called diggers.  Have you ever seen it?  It was about the last guys that were like bay men out on Long Island where they would  just get up and clam.  And that was like the living in Long Island until like the seventies. 
[00:15:30]  I grew up around that.  Yeah.  I had a friend whose father was a big time clammer selling his clams to the city and  all that.  Right.  And he built an extra garage that was just a fucking cooler.  For all the clams that he was bringing in.  It was big business for a while there.  What do you just go out with a boat and scoop the bottom of the ocean?  It's literally what you do.  These boats were small too.  And they just went out, worked it.  I've done it.  The clam rakes, they're a pain in the ass.  They're like, you know, a 30, 40 foot pole and you got to get in there and dig.  And I don't know how these guys did it for a living. 
[00:16:00]  We would do it for fun every once in a while.  Can you get sick eating a fresh clam like that?  Or does it only if they go bad?  Not when I was growing up, but now, you know, a lot of the water is fucking poisoned.  Yeah, that's the problem.  And all that shit.  So you don't know what you're eating.  I don't know why clams frighten me as far as health.  I don't know why.  I love clams.  I do too, but I don't know why I always get sick when I eat a clam.  Any other seafood bother you?  No, just the idea of oysters.  I eat them, but I'm always scared because it's so raw and it's so unfixable if it's bad.  Like, I'm always afraid that I'm going to get sick when I eat them. 
[00:16:30]  Nothing better than a fresh clam, man.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Or baked.  Baked clams.  I used to go to Umberto's Clam House because I like Joe Beningo.  And he advertised.  Right.  So I went down there and I always baked clams.  They were ruled.  Fresh over baked, but baked certainly not bed.  Oysters, not so much, but I'll eat them.  But a nice tray of clams and a beer.  We used to have, like, little clam shacks all over Long Island when I was growing up.  My dad would stop on the way to, you know, wherever the fuck we were going.  We'd get a quick dozen. 
[00:17:00]  He'd get a beer.  Look at the water.  It was awesome.  You would just sit outside, like, at a picnic table or something?  Yeah, man.  It was like a little shack.  Sometimes they would have a couple bar stools, maybe three or four tops.  And they were all over the place.  And you would just stop and have a dozen clams.  And they were fresh, right?  Fresh as fuck, yeah.  Well, most of the clams used to come from Long Island.  Yes.  And then they just fucking destroyed it.  They were literally, would get them in the water you're looking at.  Like, they're coming in right now.  And I'm sure some fucking local politician had to get his fucking hands involved or something. 
[00:17:30]  Because they got rid of all of them.  It's too bad.  It was a nice little Long Island thing.  I would love to know why that went away.  It wasn't hurting anybody.  There was a pretty well-known place in Brooklyn, too.  Pip's Comedy Club.  Yeah.  Right around there.  Yeah, of course.  I don't remember the name of the place.  But all the comics would go over there and eat clams.  Between sets.  Nothing worse than jokes and clams.  You just get a big bucket with ice in it.  You're just fucking sitting there.  Yeah.  But, you know, I think the thought of, like, making that kind of a life for yourself, where you're not going to be rich, but you know exactly what you're doing. 
[00:18:00]  You go out and do it.  You work as long as you want.  And then you come home.  And I think, like, a lot of people would rather do that than the fucking people that you see working upstairs here.  Right.  And they're in cubicles and shit like that.  Like a grown man.  Without a doubt.  Making cold calls.  I knew growing up that I was never going to wear a suit.  I'm sure you were the same.  I'm like, I was aware that that was not for me. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And I was a caddy.  I've only been a caddy on the radio.  That's my two jobs.  And caddying was sort of like the whole clamming thing.  Got up nice and early.  Worked a really fucking long, hard day.  And you had some cash in your pocket.  But those guys treat you like shit?  No.  In general, no.  Not really.  We used to have outings, they were called, where it was all, like, guys coming from wherever.  Those guys were assholes.  But the, nah, the members in general were cool.  And you worked your way up the ladder. 
[00:19:00]  So, you know, you got to, like, caddy for a lot of the same guys that really liked you or liked you because you knew what the fuck you were doing out there.  And they treated you like a fucking superstar.  So, you could have wrote Caddyshack if you fucking put him on it.  Oh, Caddyshack.  That's my fucking life.  That was my life, man.  There's a lot of inside jokes in that movie.  And, you know, no one ever forgets that film.  No.  If you think of how many fucking comedies that get quoted.  That film's coming up on what?  Like 30 years old?  It's got to be 30. 
[00:19:30]  And you'll still, if you go on a golf course, you're going to talk, man, still?  I love it.  You're still saying that shit?  The owner of Dangerfields, Tony told me that when, because he was at the premiere because he was with Rodney.  Yeah.  And he said that all the celebrities came up in cars.  And Rodney went to the premiere in the back of a car that was towed.  He had a car towed.  And he just sat in the back.  Like, what a fucking great way to show up at a movie premiere.  Bravo.  That was, like, his first movie, too, right?  I don't know.  First, like, starring role?  He became the star.  And that movie was his. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, I don't know.  It might have been.  No, I think that's a movie that he hit with, right?  He dropped out for years and years and then came back.  He dropped out for, like, 10 years, did aluminum siding, right, and came back.  Yeah, or a paint store or some shit like that.  Yeah.  It's 32 years ago, Rodney.  Wow.  You know who was in that movie?  It was Paul Lowe.  Paul who?  Paul Lowe.  I was going to talk about this.  Yeah.  What part was he again?  He was the fucking waiter that fell in the pool.  He was an extra.  Right.  But he was an extra in, like, most of the scenes.  And if you watch it, you'll see him. 
[00:20:30]  You'll see him a lot.  Yeah.  And I think that was his breakout movie.  And then there was Easy Money, which I liked a lot.  Yeah, that came after.  And then he had, like, a string there in the 80s where, you know, he was.  Back to school?  Yeah, back to school.  He was a draw there for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Ladybug.  Natural Born Killers.  Let's not forget about that.  To me, that was the best thing he did.  I bet you that was more like the real Rodney than any of the other movies.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Not the molesting part, but just that fucking creepy, fucking angry.  When he fucking turned and then became that character. 
[00:21:00]  Holy shit.  Go up and take a bath with Daddy.  Get all clean for Daddy.  He was great.  Yeah, he was spooky as shit.  What did he do before Caddyshack?  Was there anything?  He did Solomon, but not in movies.  No, I don't know any of this.  Yeah, no.  It was Caddyshack.  Well, he did The Killing in 56 as an onlooker.  Uncredited.  The Projectionist in 71.  Benny and Barney, Las Vegas Undercover in 77.  Like, never heard of these.  The Killing, I think, is Kubrick, isn't it? 
[00:21:30]  Is that the same one Kubrick did?  It might be with Sterling Hayden if it's a, yes, it is a Kubrick movie.  And Sterling Hayden, we're both right, yeah.  So he was just fucking extra or something in that movie.  I would love to watch that again and try to find him.  Because he wasn't Rodney Dangerfield.  He was probably Jack Cohen, I think was his real name.  Sorry.  Can we take a phone call?  Yes.  We've got to go back to the parents' bed thing.  Tom in New York.  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You're out, Tom.  Hey.  Hey, you guys are talking about parties. 
[00:22:00]  And I just wanted to tell you, when I was a teenager, my mother was a single parent.  She was working in the hospital in Boston.  She'd work like Friday and Saturday nights.  My brother and I, my little brother, we'd have, you know, we'd have bachelors at our house.  And one night we had a bash at our house.  And my buddy put this girl into my mom's room and fucked her in my mom's bed.  And the next morning I woke up early to clean up the house before she got out of, before she came home from work.  And when she came home, she goes, you know, who was up to my bed last night? 
[00:22:30]  And I was like, no, I didn't want to get busted.  So I was like, I think that's it, my little brother.  And she goes, well, there's cum stains all over the ship.  Now, did she say cum stains or stains?  She said ejaculation.  She was a nurse.  So I had to comfort her.  Jimmy, you didn't leave cum stains in your parents' bed, right?  No, no, no, no.  I didn't.  I just thought you were all nice for everybody. 
[00:23:00]  The girl was creeped out.  She wasn't comfortable.  Really?  I remember we were talking on the phone one time.  Thanks, Tom.  And she forgot that I lived at home.  And she wasn't bashing.  She liked me.  But she was talking about how she wants to date.  She's like, I don't want to date some weenie that lives at home.  She called me a weenie but didn't realize she was talking to me.  And you were trying to upgrade by going in your parents' bed.  That's classic.  Awful.  That's great.  Seth in Illinois writes, did you know the guy who wrote Caddyshot killed himself?  Did you know that?  No, I didn't know that.  Before it ever came out because it was originally.  No, no, no, no.  That was the guy from National Lampoon, right? 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  I can't think of his name.  But he fell off a fucking cliff in Hawaii.  I don't think he killed himself, though.  I think he was hiking.  Oh, then Seth's usually good.  What's his name?  Like Penny or something?  Seth, you're usually good.  Because he's saying that Caddyshot was originally a drama.  And he thought it would have been ruined and was going to suck.  That's crazy.  We would have known that, right?  Yeah.  All right.  What's the guy's name?  Douglas Penny?  Yeah.  He was one of the National Lampoon writers. 
[00:24:00]  He came up with all those guys.  All right.  And he fell off a cliff in Hawaii, you said?  Yeah.  I kind of remember that now.  I had never heard that he jumped.  Right, right.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Well.  I'm going to fuck a TMZ over here trying to figure out.  Speaking of killing themselves, we've got a situation with this Seinfeld character.  Holy fuck.  Have you heard this audio yet?  I haven't heard it yet.  I've heard about it, though.  I'm not a big Seinfeld guy.  Where's Travis?  Who was it?  It was Costanza's boss in Seinfeld. 
[00:24:30]  Costanza's boss.  Was it Kruger's name or something?  Yeah.  Daniel Von Bargen, I think, is his real name.  You know this guy.  You've seen him a million fucking times.  A character actor.  And I think he's living in Cincinnati.  Yikes.  He was on Seinfeld.  He ends up in Cincinnati.  And I guess he has diabetes or something.  And they took his leg.  And now they were going to take some toes.  And he said, fuck this.  He shot himself, right?  With a shotgun.  You mean with a shotgun?  He blew it? 
[00:25:00]  I believe so.  And he survived.  Oh, my God.  He shot himself in the head.  Not the mouth, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  In the head.  Wow.  Do you want to hear this?  It's early.  Yeah.  I haven't heard it.  When you shoot yourself, by the way, and you survive a pistol, it's because a lot of times  instinctively you just pull away.  You jerk.  Not even meaning to.  And that's why a lot of times a bullet will graze.  That's why they swallow the shotgun.  That's a guarantee.  That's a fuck.  Because you can't move your fucking head.  And even that, you could probably move and just blow your sinuses out.  And I'm sure some guys survive that.  Now, here's the deal, though.  So he shoots himself. 
[00:25:30]  He doesn't die.  Right.  Then he calls 911.  And with the, holy shit, help me.  Let's say this.  If you were trying to shoot someone else.  Right.  And they didn't die, you'd shoot them again.  Right.  So why is he then going, now I want help?  You could have fucking just not done it.  Right.  60 seconds before.  He had a realization.  He wanted to live.  When there's a bullet in you, I guess he was like, I don't know, this is very unpleasant.  I always wonder about that because of that documentary of the Golden State Bridge where everyone  goes out there and jumps. 
[00:26:00]  Did you see that movie?  No, I heard about it.  It's fucking brutal.  It's called The Bridge.  They said everybody regrets it after they jump.  That's, yes.  And we talked to one of those guys.  And we asked him the question, what are you thinking as soon as you jump?  And he said something like, I'm paraphrasing, I wish I wasn't jumping.  You know, I wish I didn't jump.  Immediately you realize, fuck this.  Why did I just jump off the bridge?  But then again, there's one guy who back dives off the bridge and he didn't seem to regret  it at all.  He seemed to just enjoy.  That guy was the grand finale of the movie. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  They kept teasing him the entire movie.  Really?  And, yeah.  And he was the grand finale.  He went backwards with his arms spread like this.  Wow.  He was dressed, I think it was a black trench coat.  A black trench coat.  But that movie creeped me out.  These guys, they were aware that a lot of people were jumping off the bridge, set up  cameras for, what was it, Jimmy?  They said it was for traffic.  A year?  They said it was for traffic pattern studies.  So the city allowed them to do it.  But they were really filming jumpers.  And you would catch some in the great distance, like a little splash in the water. 
[00:27:00]  And some, they'd be down by the rocks and they'd see a guy pacing up on the top.  And they knew he was going to jump.  And there's nothing you could do.  I mean, and they caught some people jumping.  And it's really creepy.  And then they would interview the family sometimes and the friends of these people.  And the one guy who jumps at the end, they interview us.  You see the whole movie, they're talking to his friends and family.  So you assume he's going to do it.  But you could see people were annoyed, too.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, yeah, he's always talking about it.  He was always, you know, it's like a writer ready.  Just get it off with. 
[00:27:30]  Did anybody cannonball or jackknife?  No, just the one guy going backwards.  It was a lot of clumsy.  People are clumsy when they jump.  Yeah.  It's never graceful.  I would do the, throw me the ball and I'll catch it on the way back.  Yeah.  Backyard.  If you're going to go, you might as well make it impressive.  But we interviewed the guy.  Maybe we should replay it.  We got that audio, right, E-Rock?  It's too morbid, though.  Yeah, I'm looking for it.  But that guy was like, fuck that.  As soon as I jumped, I realized I didn't want to die.  And he was lucky enough to survive.  With, you know, he's pretty much completely healthy now from his injuries. 
[00:28:00]  I can understand it because that's how I am on most vacations.  Like, why did I fucking decide to go here?  I'm going to save a lot of hassle and a lot of money.  God, you're right.  We all need to go away.  And then you realize, what am I doing?  What is this?  This is so nuts.  Right.  All right, here's the guy from Seinfeld, Costanza's boss.  This is the 911 call.  911 emergency dispatch, not again. 
[00:28:30]  Yes, I shot myself in the head.  And I need help.  What's your name?  Daniel Von Bargain.  All right, Daniel, what's your...  All right, I think fake name.  Yeah.  This is a prank call.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  What's your phone number?  Three, five.  Okay, and how old are you?  Sixty-one.  Was this accidental, or...?  No, I was supposed to go to the hospital today, and I didn't want to. 
[00:29:00]  I shot myself.  That didn't work.  Okay, anybody else there with you?  No, I'm alone.  And I just shit in my pants.  Okay.  And I just shit in my pants.  This is like the calls I take from Fez.  This is too close to home for Ronnie.  This is my weekend calls.  All right, so you're okay now, though?  All right. 
[00:29:30]  Okay, buddy, we'll clean you up.  You're fine.  What happens?  Holy fuck.  Okay.  All right, what kind of gun did you use?  A .38.  Cold.  Where's that at?  It messed with me on the bed.  Oh.  So how do you fuck up with a .38?  I can't open my eyes.  Okay.  All right, now where...  You shoot yourself inside of the head or the chin?  I shot in my temple.  I shot in my temple. 
[00:30:00]  Okay.  And it was...  I don't know.  I can't open my eyes.  All right.  So you're still in the bedroom, correct?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Just stay on the phone with me, okay?  I just want to keep you talking with me.  Do you have any family that lives close to life?  Two sisters, who were going to come later in the morning.  How long ago did you do this, Daniel? 
[00:30:30]  Five.  I don't know.  Okay.  Did you just fire one shot?  Okay.  It was only one in the gun.  Okay.  No more bullets in the gun, correct?  No.  All right.  Stay with me, Daniel.  Yeah.  Stay with me.  So, Daniel, you did this because you didn't want to have your toes amputated?  I was tired.  The one leg was already amputated.  Really?  And the other was going to start working off.  I had no children and no life. 
[00:31:00]  I'm tired.  I understand.  I understand.  You don't.  You don't understand.  Shut up.  I don't fucking know why he's doing this.  Big deal.  A couple toes.  Yeah.  Now you're going to want to reach over, Daniel, and grab the gun.  Right.  If you understood, yeah, you'd say jump out a window or something.  Fuck.  There's still more.  This is the biggest part this guy's ever had.  Right.  This is fucking huge for him.  I fucked it up. 
[00:31:30]  Well.  Oh.  We're going to get you some help, Daniel.  He's checking.  Someone's at the door, I think.  Someone's at the door?  It sounded like it.  What I don't understand is, wouldn't this be more painful than what we're hearing? 
[00:32:00]  The whole thing doesn't make sense.  I don't understand how I could do any of this.  Wouldn't you be screaming your head off?  No, maybe not necessarily.  From the pain?  No, I mean, if you're in shock.  He's probably in shock.  I mean, he recognizes that he shit his pants and he can obviously feel.  Right.  But I don't know.  I think he probably pulled it away.  And you're beyond yelling.  You're just in such agony.  Right.  Do we know the extent of his injury?  You know what I've heard?  I've heard getting shot in the head feels like having ice water dumped on your head.  Like, it feels like cold, cold water has been dumped on you. 
[00:32:30]  That's the description I've heard.  So, in the summer, we should all shoot ourselves in the head.  God damn, that feels better.  Middle of August.  Remember this conversation.  Okay, well, I just want you to sit tight where you're at.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not moving anywhere.  But I don't see anyone.  Yes, hello.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Daniel, I'm going to let you go. 
[00:33:00]  Good luck to you, buddy.  All right, thanks.  All right, bye-bye.  You don't have any other guns around?  No, no.  Is that one?  Yes, that one.  There you go.  He should be arrested.  The cop is basically fucking, let me see your hand.  Yeah, yeah, don't fucking move.  I will fucking pop you here on the floor.  Right, right.  I didn't even think of that.  That's the last thing you want to come walking in on.  Some fucking crazy person with a gun laying on the floor.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So, he's okay now, or is he, what kind of shape's he in? 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  You got an update, Sam?  Yeah, he's clinging to life in an Ohio hospital.  That's how he was for the last three years.  We're talking about today.  Let's say hi to Psycho Bob in Worleymore.  Hey, Ope, did you just recommend to a guy to commit suicide, he's only got one leg,  to jump out of a window?  All right, he can hop out.  Oh, okay.  Why not?  All right.  Okay, bunching out.  All right.  You can still jump in one leg, sort of. 
[00:34:00]  You don't really, you don't even think that you need both legs.  Oh, yeah, we talked about it earlier.  I mean, I'd rather them take a leg than a fucking arm.  Fuck that arm shit.  They don't have the arm figured out.  I've seen people, I go to Central Park a lot and bike and, you know, run and all that shit.  And you see the one-legged guys getting along just fine.  What do they got?  They got the spatula thing or, and every once in a while on Columbus Avenue,  you see a guy with the titanium fucking fake leg, with the foot and the sneaker, 
[00:34:30]  and they're walking better than a lot of the other people on Columbus.  See, I don't like that at all.  I like a guy who just ties off his pant leg.  One of those fucking things.  Oh, really?  Old school?  Just tie it off the pant leg.  Old school.  Just fucking walking around with it.  With crutches?  Yeah, I'm not going to let the pant leg fucking swing back and forth.  Well, Ronnie said he'd take my left arm.  I would rather, I think, lose my, I mean, basically, I use my left arm like I'm in a fucking hockey fight.  I'm just, you know, I'll just grab it, whatever, and then the right has to do everything. 
[00:35:00]  Your left arm's useless?  I don't do a lot with it.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, if you was gone, you'd probably miss it a lot.  Fuck yeah.  Like, oh, fuck, I should have appreciated you more.  Every time you went to lean and it wasn't there.  Well, it's just a convenience to have.  I like having a left arm.  And you could hide a, you could hide it.  I'd rather have it, yeah.  I mean, a choice between having it and not, but.  And you could hide a missing leg easier.  Yeah, but you know.  With the pants and stuff.  I had a friend, he lost his leg from, like, the knee down. 
[00:35:30]  And his fucking missing foot used to cramp on him all the time.  He would get a fake phantom cramp in his foot that didn't exist.  Oh, my God.  Enough that would have him fucking scream.  How do you get rid of the fake cramp?  Oh, he's, you know.  How do you do that?  Like, this fucking Kruger guy.  Really?  He didn't take it well.  My pal, Eddie, from Big Brother.  He came in for an interview.  We've been friends ever since.  I think it was season one or two. 
[00:36:00]  It was the first year.  Was it the first year?  Yeah.  We got behind him and decided.  That's when we had fucking real juice.  And we got him his money, man.  We said, we told everyone to vote for Eddie.  He probably shouldn't have won the show.  But we said, fuck it.  We're going with Eddie because he was a local guy with one leg.  But his cut is too high where they can't really help him out.  So he has to deal with crutches.  He only uses the fake leg at family.  Yeah, there he is.  At family functions.  Like a wedding or something.  Because he can't get around with his fake leg. 
[00:36:30]  But it's less, it's more comfortable to see somebody with a fake leg than a fake arm.  Because a fake leg is much more practical.  You can probably live a much more normal, unimpeded on life with a fake leg.  Because a fake arm, man, you got your hands.  You do everything with your hands.  What do you do with your feet?  Besides, you know, I mean, you walk, of course.  Would you be one of those guys who just got like a rubber fake hand and he just fucking throws down?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Like the cop in fucking Young Frankenstein.  You're not that cloth. 
[00:37:00]  I don't know.  They just don't know how to figure it out.  You wouldn't want a hook hand?  Just fucking constantly throwing it out?  Growing up, my brother's friend's father had the hook thing.  So it creeps me out to this day.  He lost his arm in a factory or something.  They could do almost anything with it.  But this is back in the 70s, I guess.  So, I mean, just imagine what they were like.  A lot of those guys used to lose their fucking limbs and shit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  When you worked in a factory.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people forget that.  That's not all that long ago.  But dads would die. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  When they went to work.  Right, right.  Oh, his dad died at work.  Yeah, there was a chance your dad wasn't coming home from work.  Yeah.  My brother-in-law, his dad was one of the oil refineries there.  Whole thing blew up in Philadelphia.  They never even found them.  Wow.  Just gone.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  You never hear about people on radio dying at work.  No.  Just something fucking goes really bad.  Well, we all just get brain cancer at 55, though.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Because what do you think this is doing? 
[00:38:00]  Look at Jimmy.  I just freaked him out.  You're just working around electricity all the time.  Yeah.  You're just surrounded by all these.  Yeah.  You know how they talk about cell phones are dangerous?  We got cell phones times 100.  Oh, fuck.  And we're making four-hour phone calls every day.  What do you think is going to happen to us?  Most guys that work in radio make it to, like, 60 tops.  I should take my hand out of them.  I should take them off and leave them off.  I never put them on.  You just, like, fucking killing yourself with them.  Fuck. 
[00:38:30]  Here's the weird thing, though, about electricity.  You feel better?  You're going to figure all the people in the history of the world never had artificial lighting until, like, 100, 110, 120 years ago.  Now, you don't even know what the sky looks like at night.  There's so much fucking light pollution that we are cut off from the way people saw the sky for 60,000 years.  And we're the first fucking generations to go, I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know what's up there.  We could also see it better than they could, though, with our telescopes. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, for all their great vision.  Yeah, right.  They saw the moon as a fucking...  But, I mean, just as, like, you walk out of your house and just that feeling of, like, sometimes when you're in the mountains and you just get the whole Milky Way thing.  You don't realize how white it is up there.  It's crazy.  When you're really away from city lights, there's a lot of white up there.  We were in the mountains, like, a couple years ago, and we just walked out at night and saw that.  And we all got, like, fucking Jimmy.  Like, we're all like...  Yeah.  Everybody almost fell down from just looking at the heavens. 
[00:39:30]  Pretty fucking cool.  But we're not around that at all.  And, like, us just surrounded by this fucking radio waves and electricity.  And plus, when you're walking down the street, you're hit by stuff.  Everything.  You know, everywhere you go.  How can Wi-Fi...  I always think, like, Wi-Fi in a city, that couldn't be healthy for the whole city to have Wi-Fi zipping through it.  No, it can't be.  And don't you think, like, subconsciously, we've got to be picking up on some of that shit, you know?  We've got to be on some level picking up on it. 
[00:40:00]  Some weird shit in our brains.  Fuck.  That's what happened to Kruger.  He couldn't fucking take it anymore.  Too much Wi-Fi.  Yeah, too much Wi-Fi.  Two of his toes fell off.  And then he missed shooting himself point blank.  But he was that guy.  He was confident when we saw him on TV.  Yeah.  Hey, T-Bone.  All right.  We got Ronnie B. today.  We're very excited about that.  And we got Kevin Pollack stopping by later.  You know Kevin there, Ronnie?  I don't know him.  I know his work, of course.  Last time he was on, he was great. 
[00:40:30]  He was playing Carolines this weekend.  So he'll be here at 8 o'clock.  And, Jimmy, you got something going on?  Yes, I do.  I leave tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Hollywood Improv in Florida, in Fort Lauderdale at the Hard Rock.  And today at 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. is the pre-sale for my April 28th show at the Ohio Theater.  I'm doing two shows, and I'm shooting them both for my one-hour special.  Just go to – fuck, I don't have the real word.  But go to the – I have to tweet the fucking – 
[00:41:00]  Oh, boy.  The link, playhousesquare.org, I think it's called.  And I'll tweet the link for pre-sale.  The password is WMMS today, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Both shows will sell out.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to do a little – maybe a little debate, maybe.  Oh, I'd love to because I got something for you for that, too.  You do?  There's something about that debate that was really bugging me last night.  Oh, good.  So we'll do that.  Romney misquoting fucking George Costanza.  Seinfeld.  You saw that?  Yeah.  Okay.  And the guys pulled a Troy story. 
[00:41:30]  Yep.  But you won't tell us what it's about.  You want us to just play this cold.  You want us to play this cold.  You're confident that this is going to work.  I thought it would be fun if you listened to Roland's immediate reaction to it before you listen to this story.  So what are we going to play – what is Roland laughing at?  What's Roland laughing at?  All right.  This is Roland laughing.  And then after the break, hopefully, before Kevin Pollack, we're going to get the story?  Yeah, sure.  That was told, what, on the after show yesterday?  The end of the after show yesterday.  This is Roland laughing. 
[00:42:00]  And we're going to find out why he was laughing like that.  Right, right.  But he laughs like that all the time.  Yeah, but it's always for some reason.  And I want to talk to Roland about Jeremy Lin.  You in on this Lin thing?  Oh, yeah.  I am.  In a big, big way.  You know, they're playing tomorrow.  Miami.  Tonight.  Oh, is that tonight?  Yeah, I can't fucking wait.  That's one of the big tests.  It's cool, too, to have to go down there and compete with that big game in Florida. 
[00:42:30]  That'll help ticket sales for the show.  You got a show tonight?  Yeah.  Oh, you're fucked.  That's good.  Everyone's talking about the next fucking heat tonight.  No, no, that's good, though.  They're going to watch me instead of the big next heat game.  All right, Ronnie's all in with Jeremy Lin.  We're going to find out why.  We're going to talk about the debate, and we're going to get this story from Troy that  made Roland laugh so hard.  Yeah.  Perfect.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  He's so horny.  Serious XM.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Don't touch me like that.  Don't touch me like that. 
[00:43:00]  No.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  You know I really like you, but I don't like the way you touch and touch.  Touch.  No.  Touch it.  Touch it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Touch it.  No.  Do you ever hear anything like this?  This.  This.  This.  Anus.  Anus.  Anus.  Is a useful thing indeed. 
[00:43:30]  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  Remember that anus is the proper word.  Anus.  It's relief in time of me.  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  No.  Pulver.  Pulver.  Pulver.

[00:45:00]  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer. 
[00:45:30]  No books.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is B?  A guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  For the minute I get it.  For the minute I get it, dude, what do you do with the fucking nap? 
[00:46:00]  Give me the fuck.  It's ridiculous.  It's like a fag walking around with his fucking napsack.  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the napsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the napsack off my back.  So, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street.  Hits some chick in the leg.  And it opens up.  And the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this. 
[00:46:30]  There's your fucking napsack, huh?  Are we hanging?  Fuck the napsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting it in my face going, hey, you know what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  All right, stop.  Now, before you walk in the door to slicker store and try to get money out the floor,  you better think of the consequence.  Who are you?  I'm your motherfucking conscience.  That's nonsense.  Go in and gaff all the money in front of one of your aunt's ribs.  And borrow a damn dress in front of a brown wig.  And I'm telling you, you need a place to stay.  You'll be safe for days.  If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades.  Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to,  the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you.  Think about it before you walk in the door first. 
[00:47:30]  Look at the store clerk.  She's older than George Burns.  Fuck that.  Do that shit.  Shoot that bitch.  Can you afford to blow this shit?  I do that, Rich.  Why you give a fuck if she dies?  You that bitch?  Do you really think she gets the fuck and you have kids?  Man, don't do it.  It's not worth it to risk it.  You're right.  Not over this shit.  Drop the biscuit.  Don't even listen to Slim, yo.  It's bad for you.  You know what, Dre?  I don't like your attitude.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute. 
[00:48:00]  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Did I fuck up the hook again?  No, there's really no...  There's no hook to this one?  There's really no set hook in this song.  I said off air that I'm embarrassed to do this bit in front of the great Ronnie B.  Are you enjoying Ronnie B on the show today?  Of course.  Ronnie, we get topical.  Mm-hmm.  And it's up to E-Rock to kind of play something, and then we have to figure out why he's playing it.  Any ideas on this one?  No, I have no idea even what that was. 
[00:48:30]  Is it like an Eminem thing?  It sounds like an Eminem thing.  That's Eminem.  So Eminem did something today.  You know what?  Is there a new Eminem?  Is it the brown Eminem?  No, it's not that.  Eminem, what's that?  Man, that would have been clever.  That would have been clever.  Like if it were news about the candy and he played the rapper.  The problem with the bit is he's not really clever with it, and that's what we're hoping for.  Yeah.  So this thing will be going away soon.  Hopefully.  Oh, well.  Eminem's first album, the Slim Shady EP, was released. 
[00:49:00]  13 years ago.  13 fucking years ago.  My name is.  I feel like he's a new artist still.  Yeah, that's what happens.  It happens, right?  To the best of us.  My apologies, Eric.  What happened?  I broke his phone yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean you broke his phone?  I didn't even know, but people out in the hallway and some of our staff heard you slamming the phone down repeatedly yelling why you can't dial out.  Here's what was happening.  I had to do a phoner to promote.  And the fucking phone, I was dialing nine, and then I kept dialing the numbers, and it kept going like, well, you ever dial a phone and you're six digits in? 
[00:49:30]  And it's like, you motherfucker.  Or I would get like seven or eight digits in.  It would be like, boo-doo-doo.  So there was something wrong with that phone.  I couldn't dial out.  I hit nine, and I dialed the number.  You had to figure out the code.  Did you press one after nine?  You go nine, one.  Of course.  One, nine, five, four.  It was a Florida air code.  The one, nine, five, four.  That didn't work.  Then it was nine, five, four. 
[00:50:00]  That didn't work.  I love how you're asking Jimmy like Jimmy's an alien from another planet.  Well, I didn't think he knew.  I didn't think he was dialing nine.  Yeah, I did try dial.  I did dial nine.  He lives in hotel rooms.  He understands.  Yeah, he understands nine, one.  Yeah, and I will say this.  I just got so angry.  Once it started ringing, when I was eight digits in, can I start to think I had it?  Yeah.  And then eight digits in, it started ringing.  I was like, you cunt.  And I slammed the phone down.  And it was E-Rock's phone?  Yeah, I broke it.  He was so pissed.  I didn't mean to.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I couldn't hang up the line.  I found out Joe Pesci got fucking whacked. 
[00:50:30]  You motherfucker, you motherfucker.  So, E-Rock, you don't have a phone?  Not right now, no.  No, because I couldn't get the line to turn off, and he broke the little button that the  receiver goes on to actually hang up the phone.  It's now buried inside of the phone.  Oh, it's not his cell phone?  No.  Ah, who cares?  It's a company phone?  Who cares?  I thought it's a better story if it was his cell phone.  No, it's hilarious.  E-Rock was really pissed about it yesterday.  Were you?  What do you do with the phone? 
[00:51:00]  You don't do shit with the phone.  Who uses a company phone?  Ronnie, you use a company phone?  No.  Of course not.  I have never even been in my office.  We haven't been in our office.  Upstairs somewhere.  You don't even know where it is, huh?  They moved it, I think.  That's better than us.  We have an office down this hall.  When was the last time I was in there, Sam?  Be honest.  Last time you were in it?  Be honest.  Probably, it has to be a year and a half at this point.  Easily.  I was going to go at least a year.  You're going a year and a half?  Yeah, I would say a year and a half. 
[00:51:30]  Do I still have a computer in there?  No.  Theoretically.  I mean, the interns use it, but that would technically be your computer.  See, the mistake the company made was putting the office way too close to the assholes.  Right.  Remember the old days?  Like, the jocks had their own area.  That would be, yeah.  You didn't hang out with the fucking assholes.  Ronnie knows.  T-shirts against the suits.  When me and Ant, you know, went to Boston AF, they put us in a storage closet.  That was our office.  But you know what? 
[00:52:00]  We were really happy because we were away from the assholes and the cubicles.  One of the offices I had in Florida, we put black lights up, took the phone off, and put beads down.  And when the fucking bosses ever came in to talk to us, we just hit a strobe light.  We were like, hey, man.  Just fucking trying to be as weird as possible.  Fuck yeah.  Now, don't you feel bad, though, that two guys in Florida yesterday were like, well, we were  supposed to be getting a call from Jim Norton, but hasn't gotten in touch with us. 
[00:52:30]  No, if I did, I used someone else's phone.  Because I have to have the phone wiped down before I use it.  I don't like talking on somebody else's phone.  It's disgusting.  Even if it's Eric's phone?  Anybody's phone.  But in your private life, you do weird shit.  Yeah.  But a phone grosses you out.  Just there's something about being on a phone, somebody's face, grease, and breath.  Anybody.  I don't want to touch.  I don't use people's phones.  I don't use people using my fucking phone.  Anything worse than smelling someone's bad breath on their phone?  I wouldn't know.  I don't do it.  You don't get that close to it?  You don't get that close to it?  No, I have to.  I Clorox wipe it.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Clorox is good. 
[00:53:00]  I think your office is in a good place, though.  It seems like you're kind of hidden.  There's more suits upstairs than there are downstairs.  There are.  Yeah, but they're not the regular, you know.  They're not people that make decisions.  I don't think we were supposed to survive this long in this business to see it change like this.  I think we were supposed to go with the rest of them years ago.  No, now you're like an old cowboy who sees a fucking train going by and everything's ruined.  Right.  What happened to the stagecoach?  They're putting fences up out here. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Cattle used to run everywhere.  Right.  They'll be fucking hunting you down soon.  That's why I think it's good they take you out, you know, take you out before we get to this stage, the bitter stage.  Right.  Are you in the bitter stage officially, Ronnie?  I think I came into the business in the bitter stage.  Really?  Yeah, I've always thought it was kind of fucked up.  Really?  Even when it was fun.  Even when it was fun, you thought it was fucked up.  Yeah.  I always knew that the whole fucking...  I always hated the way that they would turn. 
[00:54:00]  You know what I mean?  That the bosses would turn.  Yeah.  That always sucked.  Plus, here's the thing that's bothering me right now in this room.  It's like I got a Barton Fink thing going with that one fucking piece of wallpaper that's open.  What's a Barton Fink thing?  Have you ever seen Barton Fink, the Coen Brothers movie?  All right, you're in.  That's your next rental.  Oh, it's good.  You got to pick it up.  Yeah.  You like the Coen Brothers, right?  Yeah.  This is one of their, like, early 90s, really a fucking classic film.  Yeah, I'm familiar with the name.  I just, I've never seen it.  And you got the walls kind of feeling. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, there was just a thing he had, like, the entire movie is about him having writer's block,  and he's in this shitty fucking hotel room, and he just keeps looking up in his wallpaper,  just keeps fucking, and that just, that kind of is his soul unraveling, and that's how  I look up at this sometimes.  Like, you know somebody can fucking fix it.  You want us to fix that?  No.  I want it to stay like that.  You want it to stay like that for a while?  Yeah.  All right.  Don't you think you need a little bit of that to me on radio?  Oh, yeah.  I told you before the show, I got to stop bitching, because, and I know a lot of the listeners 
[00:55:00]  are sick of it, but here's the, and Ronnie will back me up.  There was a time when you bitched, you got a lot done, and that's why you bitched.  Right.  Now I'm realizing I'm just bitching out an open window, and no one is fucking either  listening or caring about it.  So now I look like a complete asshole, because I can't get things done through my bitching anymore.  Because there's too many studios here.  They don't, you know what I mean?  There's just too many.  Yeah.  You don't want it, somebody else will take it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, they don't care.  We're like those fucking Purdue chickens. 
[00:55:30]  We're all just on that thing.  Fucking heading through the grinder.  Right.  What, Sam?  You guys, compared to the other shows in this building, not compared to what used to happen  in the business, but compared to other shows in this building, you actually do get  a lot done by bitching.  Well, not like the old days, man.  No.  Not like those.  Sam, I know no one listens to you in Who Kid.  Yeah.  You know that's a fucking problem.  Is that one of his shows?  Yes.  That's one of the Sam's shows.  You think we get a lot done by our bitching? 
[00:56:00]  A lot of the shows.  I certainly don't feel that.  A lot of the shows are envious at the amount of what you get done.  Yes.  Yeah.  A lot of other hosts are envious at how much you get done.  See, envious isn't the word.  It's jealous.  That's the word.  It's a frame of envy.  So now the listeners can blame Sam because I was ready to stop bitching today, and you're  telling me, no, keep bitching because things are getting done.  Those guys that just walk down the hallway don't get anything done.  They play stupid pop music.  But they want stuff that gets done that they can't talk about.  What do they want?  What do they want done? 
[00:56:30]  What do they want?  They talk two minutes an hour.  Another Gaga song?  Yeah.  What do they want?  What do they want?  Look how they're slowly walking down the hall.  They got 25 minutes to kill.  Yeah, but they've always got ideas.  What ideas?  I don't know.  Nine-color?  When's that kids?  They're always complaining about stuff, but off the air.  That's not an idea.  That's not an idea.  Me and Ronnie and Jimmy off now.  They complain about stuff off the air.  Like what?  Because they don't complain about stuff on the air.  We're talking about, what's their channel?  Hits One, the Morning Mashup.  Morning Mashup.  What could they possibly want?  They want to be doing other stuff.  They want to be more visible. 
[00:57:00]  They want to be a bigger show.  They want to be out doing things.  They can't compete with the music.  They chose a format where you'll never be bigger than the music.  That's what I think, too.  No one gives a fuck.  Like Ronnie said, there's another fucking chicken ready to take their place.  But then again, Z100's big.  And Z100, Elvis Duran, they play the music.  So those guys are just falling short.  Yeah, they are.  They're just falling short.  They're the next Elvis Duran.  They actually want what?  I don't know what they specifically.  Exactly.  If I was the boss, I would cut that staff in half. 
[00:57:30]  You would.  Just a two person.  How many guys are on that show?  Four.  You need two.  Four, but they're doing two-minute breaks.  Right.  Yeah, it's true.  And a lot of it's today in fucking history.  It's the same thing that E-Rock just got yelled at.  Except that's the whole break.  Yeah.  But E-Rock, what song was that by Eminem?  Why didn't you go?  Guilty Conscience.  I don't know that one.  Well, is it?  Because if I go, my name is, I mean, even though.  Why not?  We haven't heard that in a while.  What song was it?  Let the phones up.  That's right.  People would be like, oh, fuck.  I remember this song.  This is great.  This is 13 years ago. 
[00:58:00]  Way to go, E-Rock.  We're loving it.  You're fucking rocking us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Instead.  It was a big song, Guilty Conscience.  I don't remember it.  It was big.  And I kind of like.  Who kid loves it, right?  Who kid performed it at the Grammys?  You did?  Yeah.  All right.  Dre was on it.  I'll shut the fuck up.  I forgot about Dre.  That's the problem.  That's what happened.  I forgot about Dre.  Everybody want to talk like they got something to say.  Good old Dre.  All right.  We got Kevin Pollack coming in at 8 o'clock. 
[00:58:30]  And I don't know.  I watched the debate last night, but it's the same shit.  All right.  Here's what pissed me off.  Yeah.  And you know that these guys are pushing the Catholic stuff all the time.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, you've got to have.  You can't give out condoms.  You know.  Condoms.  No condoms.  No fucking pill.  All this stuff.  We're Catholics.  Rick Samturin is a fucking Catholic.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't have his, no, I'm saying that because he didn't have his ashes.  Thank you.  That's what I was screaming at the fucking TV.  Him and Newt had no ashes. 
[00:59:00]  You're screaming and yelling how Catholic you are.  You had an opportunity to show the world that you're Catholic by keeping your ashes on your head.  You had ashes on your head yesterday, I would assume.  Of course.  Unlike you, I can stop in St. Patrick's, take, get my ashes.  Well, I've been there.  I've been there since.  Have you?  Just to see if lightning will strike.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Fucking bell goes off.  I was going to run it down the hall.  I was there last year.  We had some people up from Philly, and I went for the St. Pat's.  Did you?  To this day, it's uncomfortable to walk through those doors.  I've never been inside St. Patrick's. 
[00:59:30]  It's beautiful.  I'm wondering.  They got my picture.  You've never been to St.  Why?  You live in New York.  It's amazing.  It's an amazing building.  I'll go to look at it, but what am I going to do?  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Go look at it.  All right.  Just from – yeah, maybe not from a religious standpoint, but you should walk in just to  check out what they used to be able to build in this country.  Yeah, I would do that.  They wouldn't be able to build something like that anymore.  I'm annoyed at my absolute hatred of religion.  I've turned – I've gotten completely ballistic just despising religious people, and I know 
[01:00:00]  I shouldn't.  I know I shouldn't.  It's not healthy.  When I walk around New York and I see a church, I walk into every single one of them, and  you realize, what the – wow, this one's a great church, too.  There's an amazing one down in the village, like 12th Street and Broadway.  Have you ever seen that one?  It looks like a castle.  Yeah.  They're all over New York.  Fucking amazing architecture.  All right.  St. Patrick's Cathedral would cost probably a billion dollars today to build that thing.  Easy.  Easy.  If you even find the stone workers that know how to do that. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  I mean, that's the thing.  How do they –  Those guys were immigrants, Italian immigrants.  Every single piece that you've seen like that were just Italian guys that came over.  I look at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I don't get how it was built.  You know what I mean?  I can't –  Yeah, I can't.  I can't wrap my head around it.  Like, wait a minute.  Are these individual pieces?  And then how do they make it look like one piece?  And like, what's underneath this shit?  I don't know how you do any kind of an arc.  It would just be so – everything I did would look like a – just like a fucking tree  fort.  Right.  Like squares. 
[01:01:00]  But that's really true.  Like, how the hell does that building stay up like that?  I don't understand it.  Well, I don't understand it.  You've got to see the ceiling and it's mind boggling.  Imagine air conditioning that place.  What an impractical design that is.  The thing is, the money that runs through there though – I mean, tourists are just throwing  money as they come into the place.  Yep.  They're just chucking money.  Yep.  So – all right.  So, Newt and Santorum –  Newt and Santorum should have had ashes on their head last night for all the bitching 
[01:01:30]  that they do.  And you know you're not allowed to wash them off.  Oh, really?  You're not allowed to – you can't say like, oh, I took a shower after dinner.  No, that's going to stay like that the next day.  That's the way I was taught.  Yeah, he's yelling and screaming about Satan and all this.  He had an opportunity to show the other side.  Because he would lose because when you go – when you walk down the street and if you  have ashes on your head, Protestants just are like, what the hell is going on in the  city?  This looks scary.  Right.  So, to get out in the middle of the country where they don't know what Catholics are 
[01:02:00]  –  Right.  – and they saw that man with an ash cross, they would think that the devil had him.  He's a douchebag, Santorum.  He's an absolute douchebag.  And that's maybe why we need him.  Just somebody that can start the revolution.  You know, that we can finally have the courage to fucking bum rush.  Bum rush the government.  We kind of need a little bit of a revolution.  Yeah, man.  I'm ready to light torches.  Yeah, because people are like – I've been bitching about Romney and Santorum.  They're like, we all know you're voting for Obama. 
[01:02:30]  No.  See, that's the thing.  No.  I want a revolution.  I don't think that you'll ever get around to hating Romney or Obama enough.  Right.  Like, they're just going to leave that thing in the middle.  They're both just like, I don't know, or just keep chipping away at it.  Right.  You know?  Ron Paul would be the fucking guy just to do something different.  What I like about –  I don't want him.  What I like about Ron Paul, he answers questions at the debate and he educates everyone a little bit.  He's like a teacher up there.  I like Ron Paul, man.  He explains shit to you like, oh, that's why they do what they do. 
[01:03:00]  He gives you a real answer.  Even if you don't agree with it or like it, at least it's an answer and it's not some fucking prefab statement.  They're just awful.  All of them are awful and soulless and they're just pumping out pre-thought-out lines.  At least Ron Paul is in the moment.  Ron Paul reminded me.  I wanted Newt just because I thought it would be really, really a lot of fun having him in Obama debate and stuff.  But he has fallen off the map.  Romney is going to win.  You know it from the beginning.  And Romney, to me, looks like Reagan left behind a suit and a hairpiece. 
[01:03:30]  It's just like – it's like an old fucking filtered-down copy of Reagan.  It's enough times that he's kind of like, what did Reagan used to do?  I'll try to be like that.  Doesn't it feel like there's no soul with any of these guys?  Like with this – there's no – like at least with Reagan, you felt like this is what the guy feels in his guts and this is who he is.  You don't feel that with these guys at all.  No, they don't connect with the people.  There's nothing to them.  Going with Ronnie's thing.  What was the movie?  Multiplicity with Michael Keaton? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, right.  That was it.  So it's the clone that –  Right, the clone.  It just keeps getting a little worse.  It's too many clones of Reagan, right?  It just keeps getting a little worse.  A little too many clones.  Every generation that they run it off.  Santorum has zero shot at winning the election.  Zero.  Yeah, but he's making a run in Michigan.  That's even –  If he wins Michigan, it fucks up everything for the GOP.  That's ridiculous.  They're going to be very confused.  And like you said about religious people, that goes – the people that are voting for him, it's just because they're religious.  Yeah.  There's no other reason.  He's a twat. 
[01:04:30]  He's against – he doesn't like birth control.  Just go fuck yourself.  He's enraging.  How could you be against birth control?  Not even like – abortions is one thing.  And I still disagree.  Just leave people alone.  But to say I don't want anyone to get a condom or a birth control pill, that's fucking insane.  Yeah.  We should think that way maybe after we take care of everyone that's out there already.  And then maybe we could go down that road.  That's pilgrim shit when there was like 30 of them and they had a whole country. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  So you think Romney gets the nomination there?  Yeah, I think –  No doubt.  I said from the beginning it's like there are certain people that think this is the guy.  He's kind of like Obama.  He'll do the same thing as Obama.  You know, we'll take it down to a little bit of a personality contest.  You think he can win it?  I think it's a toss-up.  It'll be a toss-up at that point?  Yeah, I think it is.  I mean there's enough people mad at Obama.  I predict and I've been saying from the beginning it's going to be Romney and he's going to take Ron Paul as his vice presidential. 
[01:05:30]  And they have a good relationship.  And Ron Paul has gone to bat for him publicly on something that he said.  They actually have a decent relationship.  And I'm telling you that's a smart move because Romney is kind of moderate.  The Republicans are going to vote for anybody other than Obama.  The key is not to get Republicans to vote for – no Republicans are voting for Obama.  Romney has them.  How do you get crossovers?  You fucking get Ron Paul who taps into that fucking very left-thinking – he can pull a lot of Obama's voters. 
[01:06:00]  I think he's too –  Romney can't.  I think he's too rogue.  Yeah, I think he's rogue.  I don't know if he is though.  I mean he's been –  I think he's too rogue, unfortunately.  He's been in the government for a long time.  He's not a first-time guy running.  But he makes a point not to like vote on anybody else's bills and none of his bills ever get through.  I mean he's just that dude.  He's a fucking rebel.  What they're talking about, his son is going to be the guy.  Yeah, I've heard a lot of things about him.  His son is going to come up and be the guy that a lot of people are hoping Ron Paul is.  That you've got to actually wait for his son to develop a little more. 
[01:06:30]  Ron Paul is a vice presidential candidate because Romney's young, so there's not as much pressure on the Republicans to pick a fucking VP as they had with McCain and Palin because McCain was old.  Vice president shouldn't hurt you as much as Palin hurt McCain.  I like your reasoning, but I don't see it.  I really don't.  I don't think Romney goes there in the end.  I'll tell you something else.  I think if Palin didn't take the money, she'd be fucking the Republican nod.  But that I quit as governor and I'm doing a reality show.  You know what I mean?  I mean she just literally sold out. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Because she'd be stomping these fucking guys.  She'd be stomping them, I think.  On the Republican side, not in the general election.  On the Republican side, those Christian people love her.  She got addicted to the spotlight.  Yeah.  And said, you know what?  Yeah, and said, fuck that.  I can do a reality show, write a few books.  I don't need to be the governor anymore.  And everybody in her family had to get paid.  I think every one of them needs a bankroll.  Yeah.  You think she's a smart lady?  No.  But she's charismatic and people liked her. 
[01:07:30]  And there's going to be that HBO movie that everybody wants to see.  Yeah.  Who's playing her?  Is it?  Oh, that hot red-headed chick.  Julianne Moore?  Yeah.  Julianne Moore is playing her.  Why not see the fan?  I guess maybe she don't want to do it.  Yeah, she doesn't want to do it anymore.  No, she wants to be.  She would cartoon the whole thing.  They need a real actress, I guess.  Romney just misquoting George Costanza last night.  It was classic.  We got the clip.  Romney just very clueless in general when he speaks, I think. 
[01:08:00]  He's very unaware.  Well, he's a rich guy.  You know what?  He came up too privileged, I think.  He's just like John Kerry.  John Kerry did the same exact kind of shit.  They're both from the same state.  They're both rich.  Reporting for duty?  Yeah, and they both don't know how to talk to regular people.  And then Santorum brought up Dukakis last night.  Did you see that?  Yeah, that was out of nowhere, right?  Yeah.  Just busting fucking Dukakis.  You don't want to be compared to Dukakis.  No one's heard about me.  He's basically... 
[01:08:30]  20-some years.  Why are you fucking busting my dick?  Wasn't he a Boston guy?  Leave me alone.  Another Boston guy.  What is it with the Boston politicians?  They just come off like dorks.  Like real fucking dorks.  Well, they all want to be Kennedy.  They all want to be Jack Kennedy.  And that's the thing.  And then everybody's always looking for another Kennedy.  But he knew enough not to put that cowboy hat on when they gave it to him because he never wanted photographs taken of him where he looked stupid.  Right.  Yeah, that was smart.  Yeah, he wouldn't put it on at breakfast in Texas.  Because that's an awareness. 
[01:09:00]  He had that awareness.  Boy, he would be horrified if this is a Pruder film.  But, yeah.  He wouldn't look worse.  Here's Romney from last night.  In an attempt to quote character George Costanza during last night's presidential debate, Romney, Romney, Romney fumbled.  I just fumbled.  Romney fumbled.  I want to restore America's promise.  And I'm going to do that.  That's good enough.  What does that mean?  Stopping your head.  Yeah.  As George Costanza would say when they're applauding, stop, right? 
[01:09:30]  Now, let me set the record straight.  The actual quote was said during the show's 172nd episode.  And it was by Jerry, not George.  In a scene where Jerry is encouraging George to, quote, end on a high note.  Showmanship, George.  When you hit that high note, say goodnight and walk off.  All right.  That's it for me.  How's it going, everybody?  What was that?  What was that?  It's showmanship.  George is trying to get out on a high note. 
[01:10:00]  Not the worst faux pas, I guess, but.  Yeah, but it's the one thing fucking Americans know.  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld.  It's the one thing they feel smart about.  Fucking sitcom quotes.  I love watching these debates.  Fucking nude is chill.  It's almost like they talked to him in the back office and said, you got to just chill out.  I wonder if he dropped out, though.  Would all those votes go to Santorum?  And then he might have really crushed fucking Romney.  Yeah.  They would absolutely go to Santorum, right?  Yeah.  I can't imagine anywhere else. 
[01:10:30]  I think that was the last debate, too.  I think we're just about done with debates.  Until they go up against Obama.  Right.  Who's singing?  Who's, yeah.  But I told Ronnie it's frustrating because he won't sing the whole song.  He sings the hook of songs.  And everyone loses their fucking minds.  Who can't sing Sweet Home Chicago?  I think he's going to sing, like, a little more.  Every time.  Until finally, like, they're just like, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.  Tell the roof off the fucker.  Tell the roof off the fucker.  He's just coming out. 
[01:11:00]  He's going to have the fucking guy with the umbrella next to him.  The guy in the diaper.  The whole fucking band going crazy.  I don't know how Obama will do in debates against Republicans now, though, because he didn't really have a huge record to go after.  Four years ago, he was the one who could attack the Republicans' record, which was in pretty bad shape with the Iraq war going on.  Now, he's vulnerable because he's got, like, a lot of stuff that he wanted to do that he didn't do or things he backed up on, even if it was for the right reasons.  Right.  So now he's – I think he's more vulnerable in a debate than he was four years ago. 
[01:11:30]  He can honestly say he didn't do anything.  He can sit there and go – I can guarantee you I didn't do a damn thing.  What do you think he's on TV right now, Chris Christie?  He vetoes the gay marriage bill, but he wants the people to vote is what he's saying.  So he's basically saying if the people want this, then they're going to get it.  Well, then how about he allows the people to vote on the rights for other people, too, like women to do this or blacks to do this or fucking obese people to do this? 
[01:12:00]  Fuck him.  He's trying to defend vetoing that bill.  It already got thrown into the courts in California when they had the same thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So in California, they voted against gay marriage, and it's being thrown into the Supreme Court.  Their Supreme Court kicked it.  It's going to go all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States is where it all belongs anyway.  All this stuff is bullshit.  Right.  It's just endless amount of bullshit.  And he, for a guy who's not running for president, is on TV constantly. 
[01:12:30]  What the fuck?  You're the governor of New Jersey.  He's probably regretting that he didn't go for it at this point.  Maybe he didn't believe he could win, and now he realizes, fuck, I would have – wow, his head is tiny on that body.  I wonder if he'd be a vice presidential candidate.  Look at his head.  And he's close with Romney, maybe.  Maybe that's the –  Maybe you go Romney Christie.  Maybe he's like, fuck, I could have had this thing.  Either that or if they ever do the Flintstones again.  He's got a real fucking shot. 
[01:13:00]  What was the Monty Python movie with the big guy?  One more –  Yeah, give me a buck.  I'm going to throw up.  Yeah, that's what he looks like.  Hey, don't skimp on the pate.  Pate.  Did you see that the Pythons are talking about getting together again?  Oh, boy.  What do you think?  The one won.  Yeah, it was just some rumblings about it.  I think everybody but Eric Idle wants to do it.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah.  And Graham Chapman.  Well, yeah, he –  Well, he's –  You can't count on him.  No, not at this point.  Wow, why Eric Idle is – you need Eric Idle. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I agree, man.  Why do they want to do this?  They're bored?  Maybe they just want to do it one more time.  You know, you take 30 years off, take one more shot.  If Eric Idle doesn't do it, Steve Martin will pop in.  Or do it.  Don't talk to Jimmy about Steve Martin.  No, I don't.  I feel bad.  Did you hear?  I saw your Twitter about it.  I feel bad about it.  But he – yeah, he ran it to Steve Martin as he was covering the Grammys for Leto. 
[01:14:00]  And Steve Martin called him out on the stuff he wrote in his book.  He was cool about it though.  And then I – I felt a little bit bad about that for a while because he's a comedian.  And I hit another comedian really hard and he didn't do anything to me.  I just didn't like a movie choice he made.  Right.  And when I look at that, I'm like I should have been more – and I just recently watched when he accepted the honor for the Mark Twain Award.  Right.  And he did a – and he was fucking hilarious in his speech.  And I'm like what I wrote doesn't reflect the fact that I recognize that. 
[01:14:30]  It was unfair because he's not a guy who would have to free speech like these fucking pigs, Jesse and Sharpton, even a stupid Al Roker.  I feel great trashing those guys.  Right.  But Steve Martin was unfair.  Did you just love Peter Sellers?  Is that the thing though?  I did but it more annoyed me that I thought a great role like the Pink Panther, you couldn't improve on that.  And I was like what are you doing?  You don't need to do this.  I kind of equated it with if somebody had put on a white suit and an arrow through their head, as a comic you'd be accusing them of stealing your shit and you'd be right. 
[01:15:00]  And that was his role.  Well, a better example.  What if they remade The Jerk?  Would he be okay with that?  I'm imagining –  Because that was a unique thing.  A good character, obviously.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm imagining you would be.  I would love to ask him that question.  I don't know why I got so annoyed at it.  Like being annoyed is one thing but why did I – I took it like – I reacted to that the way I would if somebody had bad-mouthed me personally or somebody – I just – it was just out of whack.  I felt a little bit bad about that because as a comedian I try to lay off other comics. 
[01:15:30]  I never hit them that hard because it's a weird thing you have with other comics.  But like Russell Brand doing Arthur.  Yeah, I didn't love it.  You felt like you could improve on that?  Yeah.  Those were great movies.  But he's a stand-up so I'm like more gentle with other stand-ups.  Maybe it's phony of me but –  I got a question for you.  When I was growing up, I loved Steve Martin's stand-up.  Yeah.  Did you like it?  Yeah.  At this point in my life, I don't really remember his bits anymore but I remember as a kid in high school and stuff loving Steve Martin. 
[01:16:00]  He was weird and – it doesn't hold up as well but some of it's still really funny.  His bits on The Tonight Show were funny on SNL.  He was an amazing host.  He was a great Oscars host.  And I watched an interview with Pryor recently.  Did you ever see it was on the set of Stir Crazy?  And I guess they had shot in the morning and the audio got messed up so they had to reshoot in the afternoon and it was with a schoolteacher.  And Richard is sitting there on a director's chair and he's got like a little audience.  It's outdoors and he's obnoxious because he'd obviously had a few and probably done a few lines.  And the guy badmouthed Steve Martin to him, just kind of joking. 
[01:16:30]  And Pryor is like, Steve Martin is brilliant, man.  Don't badmouth Steve Martin to make me feel good.  Like he got like a little annoyed.  And I'm like, man, I fucking – I just – I watched that again recently.  I'm like, ugh.  Right.  Fucking douchebag I am.  The cool thing about that whole story, you guys ended up doing comedy together after he called you out.  And it worked.  Yeah.  I mean, that was –  That's a weird spot to be in.  That was towards the end of the bit when he finally saw my name because he didn't recognize my face.  He didn't put two and two together until he saw my name on the CD.  But then he still was okay with it.  He wasn't a dick.  I'll say it all. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I kind of felt bad about it.  I have to watch that footage.  I have it.  He was in here not too long ago.  He was in here.  I ran into him in the lobby.  And all he did was something to do with his banjo, doing that banjo tour.  Yeah, he won't do – that's what he wants to talk about.  Yeah.  Did you speak to him?  No.  I just fucking went – there's fucking Steve Martin walking by.  That was fucking plenty for me.  Where are you at with the banjo?  Yeah, it was a banjo.  You ever get into it?  In foot of a walk?  Ever?  No.  He's good at it, but it's not my instinct.  Ronnie's a rock guy.  You ever get into the banjo?  Well, you know, I'm trying to think. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, I'm sure there's a little bit of it in the background.  It's okay.  I don't mind, but –  Mixed in with everything else, maybe.  But if it's front and center, no.  No, no.  I can't –  I never got into it.  That and the ukulele.  Like, I don't know, man.  I don't know.  You're not going to go to Eddie Vedder's fucking ukulele tour that he does?  Travis went, I think.  Did he do the ukulele tour?  And he loved it.  A whole tour.  The same and the ukulele.  Yeah.  But I love his voice so much that I think I'd be all right with it.  But I'm not going for the ukulele, no.  No.  Oh, Roland got one. 
[01:18:00]  Roland got a picture with Steve Martin, huh?  Steve Martin looks thrilled.  Speaking of Roland, we got Roland laughing before the break, losing his mind.  But Roland laughs at a lot of stupid shit.  I actually know what he was laughing at.  I don't know if I should blow the surprise.  Do you really?  Well, he thought it was hilarious that WMMS is the code for the pre-sale, which happens today from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  I got to plug this every break.  Saturday, April 28th, the Ohio Theater.  I'm shooting my one-hour special in Cleveland.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow.  Today only.  PlayhouseSquare.org is the pre-sale. 
[01:18:30]  WMMS is the password.  And both shows will sell out because we're losing seats for camera kills and stuff.  Right on.  And we're going to do the show live from Cleveland.  You want to come up, Ronnie?  You don't like Cleveland?  No.  I love Cleveland, dude.  It's a fucking...  They're hardcore fans.  They're great.  And every chick in Cleveland fucks.  They all fuck.  And there's no game playing with Cleveland girls.  That was always the place to break rock records was Cleveland.  Oh, yeah.  They would play it in Cleveland first.  Oh, yeah.  And bands.  Yeah, bands would go to Cleveland. 
[01:19:00]  And like the rest of the country, they would do like, you know, okay.  And then go to Cleveland and just destroy and just have the best shows.  So they always wanted like record guys to meet them in Cleveland to see no matter who it was.  Particularly metal was always a really good hard rock and metal town.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, always.  Like going back like for fucking ever.  Do you have any examples of metal bands that broke in Cleveland?  I'm trying to think of bands that would do, you know, like a thousand seaters everywhere and then go to Cleveland and play 15 fucking thousand. 
[01:19:30]  You know, they would just...  It was always a town that would come out for the show.  I wonder why that was...  I wonder why that was the thing.  They're just into fucking live performing.  Yeah.  They just dig it.  But why not Philly?  Boston, you understand.  Philly's a good market.  So it's Boston.  Both great markets.  Why not Buffalo?  They're just depressed.  Yeah.  It's just everything in Buffalo looks like it was done in 1983. 
[01:20:00]  Everything in Buffalo looks like it was built then.  Has a weird dingy weather beat quality.  The gold is kind of...  Like the gold's trim on stuff is kind of kicked in and beaten up.  Well, the weather just beats the shit out of everything.  Yeah.  Nine months out of the year.  They haven't really built anything new since Jim Kelly.  They were all so fucking excited when Jim Kelly was playing.  Kelly was supposed to, you know, put that whole city over the top.  Yeah.  They fell short.  And they're just waiting.  They're waiting for the next Jim Kelly.  God, did they come close.  Fuck.  That was my time up there. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  We got to get into the Roland story.  What?  Troy's story.  Troy's story and Roland lost his mind.  Yeah.  Troy...  We're counting on you guys because I haven't heard this.  You guys said just play this cold.  Well, we rarely steer you wrong.  True.  True there, sir.  And is Roland in?  Because I want to get his thoughts on Jeremy Lin from last night.  Because, you know, Roland's a huge Jeremy Lin fan.  I saw his Lin Sanity shirt.  He's got four of them.  Yeah.  But he doesn't know shit about the Knicks or Jeremy Lin. 
[01:21:00]  Well, it's a nice breakup for his East Street Band shirts.  That's true.  So it's really nice to see his wardrobe double.  That's true.  Here comes Roland now taking his time.  But, all right.  So this is the story that was told on the after show?  Yeah.  It was basically Troy was talking about crazy things that he did when he was with his band.  Okay.  And E-Rock was hanging out with Troy in those days.  Okay.  And so Troy had an E-Rock story from the...  I was enjoying Troy on the show yesterday.  I was thinking to myself, why don't we have Troy on the regular show more?  That's up to you.  That's the question you got to ask yourself. 
[01:21:30]  He fucking has a good presence and knows how to tell his story.  Roland, Jeremy Lin, you watched last night?  I watched...  I got a disc of White Collar season finale in Royal Payne's.  A disc?  Yeah.  The DVD?  You're a big fan of...  Why wouldn't you watch...  I saw two minutes.  I saw him block a shot and give an assist.  I was like, wow.  I hit play.  You have four Jeremy Lin shirts.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you watch?  I want to see White Collar in Royal Payne's.  You still have Lin fever?  Why not just go with the bit and just say, yeah, I loved it. 
[01:22:00]  It was great.  No, I like this part.  I like this way better, actually.  He just...  Why do you...  Tell Ronnie why you got the Jeremy Lin shirts again.  I had the Lin fever.  And you like when people high-five you?  Oh, yeah.  I was on the subway.  People were like, hey, yeah, Lin.  I'm like, yeah.  People go, woo-hoo.  Roland just wants to be part of things.  It's great.  You should take your eyes back.  And just fight him and have a wall with him.  He tries to fit in like Malkovich in the line of fire when he's going, woo-woo, at the rally.  Remember the presidential rally? 
[01:22:30]  He knows he's going to gun him down, but he's like, woo-woo, just to fit in.  Plastic gun.  Hey, Ronnie, Rush broke in Cleveland, supposedly.  Oh, is that right, Rush?  I don't know.  Let's go to Chad in Baltimore.  What's up with Baltimore today?  Chad.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Rush just had...  Their DVD was in Cleveland this past year, this past tour.  And this will make you feel old, that moving pictures and that whole Tom Sawyer thing is now 30 years old.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  But anyway, some radio station in Cleveland started playing Working Man, and that's the reason why. 
[01:23:00]  You know, that all started their whole thing.  Wow.  Have a great one.  So, Cleveland broke Rush.  And Rush's still not in the rock and roll hall of fame.  No.  Why would they be?  That's unbelievable.  Sam has to flash too busy getting in, and Madonna.  For moving pictures alone, they should be in it.  Nah, why would they be?  There's not enough room.  I don't know.  Why do they have such a hard-on for Rush?  I don't get it.  They're just douchebags.  I don't get it, man.  That's the official answer.  All right.  Here's Troy telling a story.  All right.  Just keep going.  I'll tell you if you have to stop.  Yeah.  How about this?  You tell the story slowly, and Eric, you can scream. 
[01:23:30]  I'll buzz in if there's a...  You know what Sam's doing here, Ronnie?  Mm-hmm.  He tricked us into getting his voice on this show.  Promoting the Sam after show.  What are you doing, Sam?  If you don't want clips from the after show, I won't give them to you.  You're tricking me.  Now we're hearing your voice.  You hear my voice every day.  And now I've got to discuss it with you.  I don't need my voice on the air.  You hear it every single day.  We're hearing it now.  Do you know how many listeners just cheered when you said that?  You have to stop.  That's fair.  Are you sure?  He gave me a mission.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:24:00]  So go ahead.  Do we have time?  We have plenty of time.  Okay.  Yeah, we have four minutes.  Okay.  Well, we used to party, and we used to have a good time, and we'd have girls over, and it would  just be a...  Yeah, it would be like, you know, probably about four or five dudes, maybe a handful  of girls.  Sure.  So a lot of the girls were down for whatever you would possibly want to do.  I mean...  Like the girl in the van.  Yeah.  Like, they would just be like, you know, whatever.  Toys, multiple dudes, whatever. 
[01:24:30]  Multiple dudes, yeah.  So, are you sure?  I'm going to keep going, Eric.  Yeah, he hasn't put the brakes on yet.  You don't have to check.  Okay, just tell me to stop, and I'll stop.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So, there was this one girl there, and she was down for whatever.  She made it very clear that she was like, like, bring it.  Like, whatever you got, she can handle.  What a treat.  Yeah.  And so...  And you guys could bring a lot.  I mean, we were fucking lunatics.  Yeah.  So, you know, I had went first, luckily, and, you know, we had, we went into another room 
[01:25:00]  and had a session together.  Sex.  You were sexing.  Yeah.  You sexed.  Yeah.  So, then I went back out to party, and it was like...  Intercourse.  Yeah.  Right.  And then it was literally like, one of the other guys went...  Wow.  One of the other guys went...  And they were all fucking this chick.  Yeah.  One after the other.  Yeah.  Was the chick conscious?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was down.  Yeah.  I mean, she was a little loopy. 
[01:25:30]  But she was down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Completely consenting, was just a fan, and was just wanting to have a good time.  I mean, you got to go first.  Because it was my apartment.  So, that's the rules.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, it's the rules.  Okay.  So, you're going guy after guy.  How many guys are we talking about?  I'm going to probably say, after me, two or three.  Wow.  So, you're talking about, like, four guys total.  One after the other.  Penetrating her to completion.  Yeah.  So far, I'm not remembering any of this, but keep going. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  Okay.  You sure?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not recalling any of this.  So, afterward, we were kind of like, Eric, get in there.  Do your thing, Sex Bagel.  Go in there.  Were you calling him Sex Bagel?  Of course.  Yeah.  That was his name.  That was his rap name.  I was like, Sex Bagel, get the fuck in there.  And he was very shy.  He was very timid.  Like, he was a very reserved guy.  He wasn't like, yeah!  Like, he wasn't a rager.  Right.  So, he was kind of, he wasn't dissimilar to the Eric that we know now. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  Right.  So, he went in to the room.  Am I okay, Eric?  Yeah.  So, I'm not recalling anything.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay.  He went in the room.  So, he was in there for a little while.  Nice.  Okay.  And we were like, what the fuck is going on in there?  Like, we didn't hear anything.  We were like, trying to listen up to the door.  Casanova.  Right.  And...  One second.  I mean, you can continue.  But, you sure this was me?  You're not confusing with anybody else? 
[01:27:00]  No.  Yeah.  This was you.  Okay.  You're positive.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  So, we opened the door.  Because you wanted to see the moos.  Well, I just, we didn't hear anything.  There was no noise in there whatsoever.  Uh-huh.  And we opened the door, and Eric was there snuggling with this girl.  Okay.  What?  I don't remember this, because I was probably drunk.  No.  No, he wasn't.  He may have been drinking. 
[01:27:30]  I don't remember this story.  Everybody was drinking.  Everybody.  Yeah, but what?  So, you get drunk, and you snuggle with a girl who's just taken five dicks?  Snuggle, buddy.  Holy shit.  Are you serious?  See?  Eric, you don't remember this at all?  Well, after the show was over, I was talking with Troy in the hallway, and we were piecing  some things together.  That was the situation, but the girl he said I was with is wrong.  Because the girl they were all banging and doing stuff with, because Troy had a jacuzzi in 
[01:28:00]  his living room, and they were doing stuff with, like, anal toys and all that stuff.  I was with her friend in the other room.  That was the one who I was kind of, like, running interference so they could all fuck with  the goer in the living room.  Yeah.  So, I passed out sleeping next to her friend in the other room.  No.  Yes.  Troy?  He's lying.  He's lying.  I don't remember it like that.  Because the next morning, her friend disappeared, and we found her crying on the front step of 
[01:28:30]  your apartment.  Which one was crying?  The one that...  The friend.  The gangbang girl.  No, the gangbang girl was up saying hi to everybody and jumping from bed to bed.  Those girls were always troopers, man.  The second girl.  They would just hang out with you the next day, the whole gang.  No problem.  Yeah.  We had a lot of great girls that would come hang out with us.  But, yeah, I don't recall exactly...  I'm, like, I'd probably say pretty sure that it was the girl that everybody...  I'm sure it was. 
[01:29:00]  No, because you guys were with her the whole night.  I was with the other one.  Why did you feel like you had to comfort her?  Yeah.  I passed out.  Did you fall in love?  No, I was running...  Did you fall in love?  No.  He thought she'd be his girlfriend.  Give her those bedroom eyes?  No, no, no.  Rescue her from this gangbang?  Yeah, you were going to be her...  Rescue her from the...  Captain Savor.  Her hero?  No.  The other one was doing all kinds of shit.  This girl was going to ruin everything, and that was the one I was running interference  with, but I passed out.  And that's what she told her friends.  Like, you know, she wanted to...  These guys all wanted to fuck her, but this guy was going to ruin everything, so I just 
[01:29:30]  hugged him.  Yeah, I think the friend wasn't giving anything up, and the other one was a sure shot, so...  So I think that's sort of why you were interested in the one that everybody got.  Well, once I realized I remembered the stories, because I remember getting woken up at one  point saying, you've got to come see this, because the girl in the living room who was  partying with everybody, they were putting stuff into her ass.  And as they pulled it out, shit shot from wherever she was on the couch to the counter in the  kitchen, and they're showing the distance of the shit that went across the apartment. 
[01:30:00]  Wait, why are you napping when this is happening?  What kind of guy are you?  What kind of stuff were you putting in our ass, Troy?  Well...  Or the guys at the time?  My roommate and the one guy in a band used to work at an adult bookstore.  Yeah.  So we would just literally go, they would say, the cameras are here and here, so you can  just take whatever you want.  So we would just get like, we had this thing called the man rammer, and it was a penis that  was this big.  Foot and a half?  Yeah, and then it had a handle on it. 
[01:30:30]  It looked like a bicycle handle.  Yeah.  And we had it on display on our mantle, and it was like, if you come in, can you take that?  That was the sort of thing.  But the man rammer, like for ramming men?  Well, a man rammer, like a penis rammer.  So you could use it on...  Yeah, man ramming.  That's for guys to get fucked.  Yeah.  Okay, well, we would use it on chairs.  How big was this thing around?  It was probably, I'd probably like a Pepsi can.  Jesus.  And then probably like a foot and a half long.  What the fuck? 
[01:31:00]  So, yeah, so we had all these like crazy sex toys that we would just have fun with,  and it was just like, if you came over, it was like, we opened up a drawer and I was  like, can we use any of these?  And Chris would be like, yeah, go ahead.  And so we would just do like anal beads that were like, you know, that big, that were  like the size of like...  A cue ball.  Yeah.  That's what you just showed me.  Yeah.  The size of a cue ball.  And it's just like...  He does a lot of visuals for the radio.  Yeah, I like that.  Yeah, I know.  I should probably describe it a little better.  Yeah, whatever.  To translate.  But yeah, I don't really recall it being that girl. 
[01:31:30]  I thought it was the girl that everybody got, that went through like a train.  Right.  I'm sure it was.  Why would you remember?  Because the room that I was in, Troy's roommate had no furniture.  It was just a blanket laying on the floor and that's all the guy had.  Well, it was a futon.  Are we missing something?  Because E-Rock doesn't seem like the type of guy that would hang out with like you, Troy.  Well, he seems like the guy...  At that time in my life, I was.  You were a little wilder?  I was a little fucked up.  A little...  I was... 
[01:32:00]  What do you mean you were a little fucked up?  I...  I...  I don't know.  I just was not happy being me at that time and I did everything but being me.  And you are now.  You didn't like yourself, Eric?  At that point, I didn't.  I just don't think Eric really knew himself and he was sort of looking for his own identity.  Why didn't you like yourself, E-Rock?  I don't know.  I just...  What was going on?  I was tired of Long Island.  I was tired of just...  It's all whiny suburban bullshit.  That's all it was.  Go ahead.  Yeah, tell us.  Tell us.  I just did. 
[01:32:30]  And what song...  And what song talked to you back then about your feelings?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Was it Everybody Hurts?  No.  Was it Janicean 17?  You were just fucking listening to it?  Your room with a candle on?  Just dreaming of going to parties with the Man Rammer and...  The Man Rammer.  Fucking everybody just changing.  Yeah.  Did you clean the Man Rammer off in between chicks?  No.  I mean...  You washed it off.  You washed it off?  I don't know if there was really sterilization.  It was a paper towel.  I want to know more about E-Rock.  He didn't like himself. 
[01:33:00]  Well...  And what music did you listen to to get you through it?  Come on, man.  Share.  There was nothing...  I wasn't relying on music to get me through it.  Like James Taylor?  Just fucking...  Really go deep?  Yeah.  I was listening to rap, punk, some hardcore.  He was really into ska.  Ska.  Yeah.  That came a little late.  Everybody gets to ska.  You're just fucking...  You're just sitting back there every day.  Sell out.  Just fucking enjoying yourself.  Mighty Mighty Boss Tones.  You're fucking less than Jake. 
[01:33:30]  No one gets me.  I wear a fucking tie that's got like little piano things all together.  No, no, no, no.  No one is going to get me.  Mighty Mighty Boss Tones.  All right.  Yeah.  We knew Eric because Eric worked at his college radio and he knew how to rig CMJ.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So the band I was in would start charting in like really weird places.  And at that time, I mean, that's how you got signed.  You know, labels would look at CMJ and go like, who the fuck is this band?  They're charting all over here.  And they would investigate.  So Eric had a way of rigging it. 
[01:34:00]  So that's how he got involved with our band and a couple other bands.  Oh, really?  For those who don't know CMJ.  So you didn't really want to hang out with him, but he had something to offer.  Well, I mean...  Be honest.  I mean, I really...  You guys became friends, but at first you're like, fuck, I don't want to hang out with this guy.  Well, I met Troy Secondary.  Like the other guys I knew before Troy and before those guys, I knew other friends of theirs from another band.  That's how I met everybody.  Yeah.  So, you know, we hung out and then we would go up and go to his school and we would play his school.  And steal all the equipment from the school. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  And then we would go out to...  The band would go into your college radio station and steal...  Oh, yeah.  The stuff that you were responsible for.  No, no, no.  Because where the radio station was later, a little further down on the floor, was the  storage area.  They would keep extra TVs and computers and things like that.  And the doors down there were not really that secure.  You could kind of...  If you gave it a gentle kick, it opened up.  And I said, look, there's a bunch of Macs and PCs in there.  Did you guys treat Eric well?  I mean... 
[01:35:00]  You took it down, Joe.  Well, a little bit, yeah.  Because he would have a party at his house and we would trash it.  Specifically because it was his house?  Like, we got to trash this guy's house.  It's funny.  Well, it was just kind of like...  We just wanted to have fun.  And Eric wanted to just belong.  Yeah.  Like, we had a hot tub.  What an evil combination, man.  Like, he passed out or something and then we took everything and threw it in his hot tub.  What do you mean everything?  Well, there was like everything we could find around.  The guy fucked a cantaloupe, came in and threw it in the hot tub. 
[01:35:30]  It was stuck in a filter.  I got a blowjob in his mom's bathroom.  From her.  No, no, no, no.  Did your parents find out about it?  Oh, they probably will today.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Funny.  Hope no one ate that cantaloupe.  There were Heineken bottles in the trees that I couldn't get down.  So all this green light was reflecting from the sun.  So the next day, like, you had to go and clean up all their mess?  When did you realize these guys were taking advantage of you?  They weren't your friends.  They're screaming at you, why aren't we charting anymore?  Right, right. 
[01:36:00]  Work your fucking voodoo.  Right.  Did you realize they weren't your friends?  I hung out with them for a couple of years, and then I got sick of it, and then I left.  Because you finally woke up.  No, because one of the guys wanted, he started asking all the band members, everything, to  start paying weekly dues into the band shit.  And I was like, I'm not paying to be here.  So I left.  Yeah, Eric's.  Then they wanted money from you?  Yeah.  I never did.  It was a fucked up situation.  But Eric's seen some shit.  Like, we used to have.  Literally.  All over the fucking place.  Right.  We used to have. 
[01:36:30]  Why was the shit flying out like that?  I don't know, but it was awesome.  Because that was.  Is that possible?  Well.  15, 20 feet.  To shoot shit across the room?  Well.  They yanked it out of her.  No, there was anal beads, and he pulled it like he was starting a lawnmower.  Yeah.  It was like, boom.  And it was like, shit went flying everywhere.  It just splattered everywhere.  And the girl was cool with this.  Yeah, she was having a blast.  She took photos.  She was having a blast.  Yeah, she had a good time.  But yeah, I mean.  There was.  Eric's been to.  Like, we used to have weekly meetings.  And we would have late night.  And then we'd have girls over.  Monday night meetings.  And then we'd have girls come over. 
[01:37:00]  So we'd do a band meeting.  And then we would just do crazy shit.  Horrific stuff.  Yeah.  And Eric's seen some pretty crazy shit go down.  There's one girl that got branded.  Oh.  With our.  Yeah.  With our band.  We just.  They.  Where's that girl now?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But her parents threatened to sue.  Yeah.  It was a real mess.  She was only 11.  She wanted to be, like, initiated into the band.  So someone came up with the idea of.  What band is this, by the way?  You don't want.  I mean. 
[01:37:30]  It's Foghat.  We don't need to really.  It's Foghat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So somebody came up with the idea of, like, hey, we have those metal wire coat hangers in  the back.  So we took it and bent it into the first letter of the band name and just by holding it with  an oven mitt on the electric burner in the kitchen, heated it up till it was orange.  Yeah.  And then.  It's not burning flesh in that.  Oh, hair flesh.  It was just.  Fuck.  Where'd you hit her?  Right in the ass cheek.  This one.  And when you heard it, you heard a crack and a sizzle and then almost like a pop. 
[01:38:00]  So it's like.  Holy fuck.  Did she yell?  Yeah.  She would scream.  Yeah.  And we're like, no, it's okay.  It's okay.  We took, like, wet paper towels and then put some Vaseline and a Band-Aid on her.  What was the drug of choice?  There had to be drugs.  Honestly.  No one just does that.  The girl or us?  You guys had to be on something.  No.  We really didn't do much.  I mean, we were sponsored by Jägermeister, so that contributed a little bit to it.  But we weren't ever really on hard drugs or anything.  I mean, I was actually straight edge at the time. 
[01:38:30]  So, and the other guys really didn't do much.  And you just felt like she wasn't going to cause a problem after being branded?  Well, you know, you just kind of get wrapped up in the moment.  Can we do this on the radio tomorrow?  I mean, that'd be great.  Oh, shit, it would.  Was Eric partaking in this stuff or was he like an onlooker?  I was there.  He was there.  He was more of an observer.  He was very observant.  Like, he didn't really participate.  I put the Band-Aid on her.  He didn't participate much.  Oh, he helped her again.  He put the Band-Aid.  He snucked her.  Well, because he probably didn't have access to a lot of drugs. 
[01:39:00]  Rock's pissed.  Oh, he's helpful.  That's nice.  I'll rescue you.  It was black, crusty, and bleeding.  So, they were like, put a Band-Aid on her.  All right, but let me ask Troy.  Did you give a fuck that was black, crusty, and bleeding?  No, I was just looking to have a good time.  Yeah, of course.  You didn't like Eric.  He just brought something to the table.  Well, Eric was a little...  It's obvious.  Maybe it developed into something, but...  He was a little nerdy.  And a little needy, right?  Well, and he just had never really been exposed to that kind of craziness.  Right.  So, he was just a little bit more, like, shocked about what was going on. 
[01:39:30]  I think he was just happy to be involved in what was going on, because it was...  He had never really been involved with anything like that.  Like when you trashed his house?  Well, he wasn't really involved with that.  He had passed out.  Let me go to Jay in Rhode Island.  He's got an observation.  Jay?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  I just thought the funniest part of this whole story wasn't the fact that the girl had train  ran on her.  It's that the next morning, she woke up and went bed to bed, but yet the girl who had to  sleep next to E-Rock was outside in tears. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I don't think...  I want to recall that it was the actual girl that got trained.  Rodney, you got a take on this whole thing?  No, I got none at all.  With the E-Rock thing, though?  I got...  You know...  Did you have the needy guys when you had your crew?  The thing about E-Rock is that he played his part.  You got to give him that.  Yeah.  You got to give him that.  They branded this girl right down to the bone.  She was in big, big trouble.  And he was there with some Vaseline and a Band-Aid.  Came to the rescue. 
[01:40:30]  He's like an EMT.  That's Mr. Cleanup.  He's the wolf.  Yeah.  He's the wolf.  If fucking shit goes down...  He called E-Rock.  You got to call E-Rock.  He's going to take...  He shows up in a tux.  And he's...  Follow me, gentlemen.  Yeah, we had fun back in the day.  It was a lot of fun.  But, E-Rock, when did you finally have it with these guys and move on?  Let's see.  What happened with that?  Was there an incident where you're like...  Early 99.  What happened, though?  I just...  I was getting yelled at for not paying money. 
[01:41:00]  Because this shit...  How much money were they going to charge you?  They wanted, like...  They wanted, like, from everybody that was there.  And at that point, there was, I don't know, anywhere from six to ten.  He wanted, like, a hundred bucks each.  Per what?  Month?  Yeah.  Was it a month or a week?  Per month.  Month.  And we found out that he was paying, like, his phone bill and everything out of this money.  And it wasn't going back into the band like he had said it was.  So it was kind of...  It was a shady, shady ordeal.  But you wanted money from him because you knew he was a rich kid.  Well, I didn't...  I wasn't the one asking for the money.  There was more of, like, a band leader that was asking for this money. 
[01:41:30]  So...  Taking advantage of E-Rock.  Yeah.  Knowing that E-Rock really wanted to hang out with you guys.  Did you guys respect E-Rock?  Uh, I mean, I liked E-Rock.  I don't know if the other guys did, but...  Wow.  What did they say about E-Rock?  Behind his back.  Behind closed doors.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, he's very similar to the way he is now.  So it's like he's just sort of, um...  I don't know.  He was just sort of happy to be involved.  And he just had...  He was a little...  A little timid, I guess.  A little, you know...  He was just excited to be there and just be involved in it. 
[01:42:00]  So he really didn't care what people did to him or what people said to him.  Did they ever use the word faggot to describe him?  Plus, I wouldn't get...  At some point, probably.  I wouldn't get piercings.  I wouldn't get tattoos.  I wouldn't do all that stuff.  So that was starting to cause an issue.  Yeah, he just wanted to be alone.  That's why he wanted to hang out.  Help the girls.  Yeah.  Make sure they're okay.  Make sure they're healing properly.  I don't think Eric really had access to girls like that that were that willing to do whatever anybody wanted.  So he just sort of...  Well, I just don't know if he knew how to react. 
[01:42:30]  He knew how to act to those girls.  And you guys would just yank fucking anal beads out of chicks, huh?  Yeah, I mean, they were just down for whatever.  They ever pink sock on you or anything?  What's that?  When, like, shit comes out?  When a little asshole comes out.  No.  I mean, these are young girls, so they're pretty tight, like a drum.  Yeah.  You know?  But...  I mean, I'm sure if they're a little bit older, I'm sure that would probably happen.  Were you ever arrested for this shit?  I was arrested, but not for that.  What were you arrested for?  Retail theft.  Shoplift? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, well, kind of.  Yeah, I was set up, but I was involved.  What do you mean you were set up?  Well, I worked at a snowboard shop, and we were on the second floor, and I used to throw snowboards and boots and stuff out the window, and then I'd pull my car around, grab it, I'd throw it in my trunk, and then I would sell snowboard shit out of my trunk.  And then I got set up by the owner of the place who...  Because they knew it was you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not a setup.  He was robbed.  He wants his shit back.  And went back and got the guy who robbed him.  That's not a fucking setup.  Yeah, but he set me up, so I got busted.  Yeah, but where's the setup part?  He set me up, so I got busted. 
[01:43:30]  Oh.  But you did it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But whenever you go down that road, you got to know when to pull back and realize, fuck, you know, they're on to me.  I was 18.  I didn't know what the fuck was going to do.  You just assumed it was going to go on forever.  Yeah, because I'm just making a lot of money, and you're just like, well, I don't give a fuck.  How'd you get caught?  This guy had come in and said, hey, I'm going to buy this, but I'm going to shove these gloves down my jacket.  Is it cool if I just give you $20 for him?  I was like, fuck, yeah.  And I took it, and then the police came and arrested me.  Because you didn't have a lot of overhead cost.  No, I mean, it was...  Yeah, I robbed that place blind. 
[01:44:00]  You were very easy to catch, though.  There really wasn't a very involved...  No, not at all.  Not at all.  It was a very, yeah, very, very simple.  All right.  Yeah, Troy, you tell some good stories, man.  I was listening yesterday after our show.  Very good.  Cool.  All the Vance stories and shit.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a rough one.  Are we going to replay that sometime?  Yeah.  You can throw that on the weekend.  If it's good, it's good.  Who gives a fuck?  That's right.  Throw it on this weekend.  Although maybe they've heard too much of my voice.  Yeah, they have.  They have. 
[01:44:30]  All right, Iraq.  But you moved on.  Iraq, you talked to any of the other guys besides Troy?  Well, there's one guy that, a mutual friend of ours that Troy and I have mentioned in the  past.  He used to weigh like 500 pounds.  And now he's down to, I think he's about 200.  Yeah.  Has his tongue split like a serpent.  Why?  He's an awesome dude.  You don't like that, Jay?  You don't like that, Jay?  You don't like that, Jay?  You don't like that, Jay?  You don't like that, Jay?  No.  That's awesome.  Yeah, food falling out.  You can't really shovel it into the backyard. 
[01:45:00]  He actually had a great stunt that he wanted to do on this show, but I don't think that  they're going to let him do it.  What is it?  Well, this dude was, like Eric said, he was 500 pounds.  He weighs about 200 now.  So he has a lot of extra skin hanging off of him.  Why didn't he get that shit cut off?  Well, he said if we could find a doctor to do it, he'll eat a pound of his own flesh.  Oh, God.  I'd like to see that.  Wow.  But they don't think that legal will clear anything like that.  That's old school NEW shit.  Is it raw or is he going to cook it?  How do you do this?  I mean, I guess that's sort of debatable. 
[01:45:30]  But I don't know a doctor that would do that and then hand you back your flesh.  I think you get the flesh back.  It's yours.  Yeah, it's yours, man.  They might put it in something that's not edible, though.  Like formaldehyde or something.  Is cannibalism illegal?  Well, we did it back at NBW.  Yeah, it's yours.  You can eat it.  We did it once.  Who's to say any can't?  It was, what's his name?  Stockbroker Dave had a vasectomy and we got the tubes.  We ate them.  I didn't eat them.  Yeah, we put it on a Ritz cracker.  It was officially cannibalism.  Soul assault. 
[01:46:00]  We did it.  We did cannibalism on the radio officially.  Yeah, but he'd be willing to do like a burger or something.  A burger of his own flesh.  That is awesome.  That's soul school radio.  Yo, who's going to make the burger?  Look, you remember the day we fucking cooked rats in NBW.  Yeah.  We could find someone to cook up some human flesh easy.  Yeah, and when this came up in a meeting, Danny actually said that he would take a bite  of it or have it.  Danny would?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  What do you think that tastes like?  Oof.  I don't know.  He was hoping crispy.  Oh, God.  I just got fucking water in my mouth. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, that's a rough one.  I don't think, unfortunately, I don't think it'll happen, but it'd be great to see.  Who's the person who says no to this?  Well, they have to run it up the flagpole, as they say around here.  So let's run it up, see how far we can go.  Let's get some shit done.  It's been mentioned.  Well, see if it makes a splash.  Yeah, let's do this.  Let's see what's going on.  Let's see if they can blue sky this shit.  Run up the flagpole.  I'll salute.  Or let them bake it, because we're going to need to bake the flesh anyway.  Oof.  Remember the old days, let's let this bake for a while.  Yeah.  Have you ever done anything crazy like that, Ronnie? 
[01:47:00]  No.  What was the craziest thing you ever did on radio?  I've never asked you that question.  I'm actually sitting right here.  And listen to this shit.  As weird as I ever got.  You were never a stunt guy, though, right?  For the most part.  For me doing it?  No.  No, there was always some fucking, you know.  No, no, I know not you personally, but I mean, you never, you guys didn't do a lot  of stunts in your heyday, right?  No, I mean, we did all the same.  That's how we had Paul O on the show and all that kind of shit.  Right.  We branded him, we did the whole fucking, put him in the fucking freezer with his D-back 
[01:47:30]  on and all that kind of shit.  But we were doing an eating contest and it was with Don Vito and he fell asleep and fucking  swallowed the stuff and fucking, it got caught in his throat and he ended up going like brain  dead.  He literally like was brain dead.  And I was like at the hospital and the doctors were saying, we can't get his fucking brain.  And I actually called his parents and I was talking to his brother-in-law and I'm like, 
[01:48:00]  uh, I don't know what the fuck happened.  We're just partying and stuff and he's brain dead.  And his mom was like fucking crying and everything.  And then all of a sudden he just sits up in bed like the undertaker and starts fucking  yelling and starts yelling, give me the fuck out of here.  I'm not ruining my vacation on this.  Holy shit.  And then I had to tell his parents, okay, he's, uh, he's alive again.  That Don Vito, the one we all know.  Yeah.  He's a big fan of our show or used to be.  I used to do shows with you.  Yeah.  I know him from my old neighborhood.  I don't care. 
[01:48:30]  I can.  Yeah.  What was the eating contest?  It was just like a chicken wing eating contest.  Him and Paulo and they were just fucking eating barrels of it and drinking the whole time.  He just passed out and died a little bit.  You know, it was one of those things where you're like, ah, fuck.  Right.  Everything's done.  Yeah.  All gone.  Was it a remote?  No, we were just sitting around the fucking studio.  So you had to get the, the dragging his body out.  Yeah, I think we actually got him into the limo before he fucking actually died.  And then they took him to the thing. 
[01:49:00]  And it's like, the doctor is saying there's no brain and like some, you know, oh, whatever  his alcohol was through the roof.  And then I guess he had thrown up and they tried to have him sit up and like, so he was  like suffocated.  But, and, but, you know, his nostrils never worked that well cause he used to spray paint  cars and never wore the mask.  He would just sit there and spray paint all day long.  So he couldn't really even, he couldn't even do lines. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  He would have to fucking eat lines like a fucking, I don't like a bear.  He was like, you've known him forever.  Yeah.  I know him forever.  Is he brain dead from your radio?  No, no.  He's fine.  He's fucking fine.  No permanent damage.  Literally when I remember years ago, and this is like a not even before radio story,  we were going in his van.  We're riding in the back of his fucking van going to Wildwood, New Jersey from Philly.  And nobody gave him a beer when he wanted it.  And he fucking put the van and fucking cruise control and got out from behind the wheel 
[01:50:00]  and walked to the back of the van with us.  And everybody was like getting high and drinking.  And you just see the driver next to you and everyone's screaming and running.  And he's like, uh, I put it in fucking cruise control.  No, we're fine.  That's like an urban legend.  No.  And we're going, dude, it ain't fucking automatic pilot.  You're not, this isn't a 747.  He just walked into the back of the fucking van.  Holy fuck.  How much time did you guys have?  Seconds. 
[01:50:30]  Who knows?  Who knows?  But he, he was always crazy.  And then they put him on TV for it.  Yeah, obviously.  You know, but like that was nothing about him was like an act.  So who grabbed the wheel?  Whoever was fucking, somebody from the back just jumped up.  Holy fuck.  And then he was yelling, I don't want anybody driving my van.  Get the fuck out of here.  He was a fucking maniac.  Yeah.  We should get him on the show.  He's not allowed to, uh.  Cross straight lines?  Do anything.  Cross state lines?  Yeah, he can't even use that name anymore. 
[01:51:00]  Why?  Uh, he got in some kind of trouble out in Colorado.  And part of the deal was he can't do his character for those like 10 years or 7 years.  So he can't be himself.  He can't be himself.  He can't go out and.  Do anything.  Yeah, do gigs anymore.  Because he was still, even after the show was off the air.  He was still living that life.  Yeah, still living it.  Wow.  Fuck.  Uh, Pat Duffy was part of you guys.  Uh, after I had finished with the band, he had joined.  So I, we never really knew each other. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, Pat.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  I just thought, I was literally waiting for this subject to come up for a really long time.  I can vouch for everything these guys are saying.  Oh, really?  They were crazy, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I'm very familiar with the man rammer.  So they used a man rammer after you were gone, Troy.  Uh, it was like.  Or a very similar one.  Yeah, I mean, there was, like we said, some of the, some of the guys that we were with  had, um, worked at adult bookstores.  So we had completely robbed them blind.  Oh, you didn't pay for the good, the toys? 
[01:52:00]  No.  Oh.  No.  Would you throw dildos out the window?  Yeah, we would do all sorts of crazy shit.  Well, let's not forget, we used to have the wiffle ball bat, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did some crazy shit, Troy.  We're like you.  Yeah.  You know.  Pat, you got a story?  Because, uh, we got to go to break.  We got Kevin Pollack, uh, standing by.  The only thing I thought of yesterday was, uh, they were talking about the rape van.  And the only thing we ever did was, we picked up this chick in Chicago, literally took all  the money out of her wallet, spent her money across the entire country, and left her on  the rim of the Grand Canyon.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:52:30]  Literally, she just passed out.  We, like, put her shit next to her outside, like, next to her tent on the Grand Canyon and  just took off.  We never spoke to her again.  She didn't have any money left?  No, nothing.  Took her credit cards, her money, everything.  You took her credit cards, too?  Yeah, well, we needed gas.  And the band, did it, did the band almost make it?  It was close.  Yeah.  It was good.  You guys make any money?  No.  No, we didn't really make money.  We had to pay money.  But we had a lot of fun.  You know, we would go on tour, and we would take strippers with us, and they would just 
[01:53:00]  pay for everything.  And then we would just do awful shit.  What a life.  Yeah.  All right, Pat.  Thank you, sir.  No problem, guys.  Later.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  Ronnie B sitting in, and we got Kevin Pollack next.  Stay there.  I don't need my voice on the air.  You hear it every single day.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.

[01:54:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kevin Pollak is walking down the hall.  He's playing Carolines this weekend.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100, right?  Yep. 
[01:55:00]  That's a number I remember.  In a world where we don't have to remember phone numbers, I know that one.  They've been good to us over the years.  Ronnie B. sitting in today.  Having a good time, Ronnie?  I was.  You were?  Yeah.  Was the Troy thing a little slow, you think?  I, you know...  That dragged a little bit?  You know, I just feel like it's Sam, once again, just bringing everything back on himself.  He does do that.  Hi, man.  Hey, Kevin.  Kevin Pollak.  You can sit wherever you want, sir. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  I want your chair.  By the way, you shouldn't have waited as long as you did.  Yeah, who gets fired over that?  I don't know.  We're going to figure that out, though.  Totally kidding.  So happy to be here.  Yeah.  You know Ronnie?  Ronnie, Ron Bennington?  I'm a fan.  Nice to see you.  How are you?  I'm a big fan.  I'm late to it.  Maybe only a year.  Mm-hmm.  But really, only two years with you guys.  Really?  Because of the serious...  Well, in Los Angeles, you know, if it's not in serious, then it's... 
[01:56:00]  And I'm like, you know, I'm going to bring my computer in the car four years ago and drive  around with you guys.  No.  But now I'm hooked, because they replay in the afternoon.  So I'm driving around listening to both of your guys' show.  Oh, good.  It's ridiculous.  It's all I can do.  I won't get out of the car.  Wow.  I've got places and meetings.  Won't get out of the car.  Very strange, because we're fans of yours.  Devoted.  So it's a weird thing happening.  Now it's not going to be funny.  No, it's good.  Now it's just, you're good, I'm good.  Do you ever do...  Not to put him on the spot, do you ever do Unmasked with Kevin Pollack?  No, we've actually asked about it before, but I'd love to bring you in. 
[01:56:30]  Before?  Yeah.  I never heard.  Yeah.  I'm in.  Now?  Should we leave?  Yes, let's go.  I'll get an audience.  We'll have an audience here within minutes, and I would love to...  He is the greatest interviewer by far.  Yeah.  We would have a good time with Unmasked.  I'm down.  I'm in.  Oh, good.  I'm all about it.  I had one of those driving around L.A. moments, listening to the show, and people were calling  in, Ron, your guy's show, about comedians who were good dramatic actors, and they were 
[01:57:00]  calling in one after another, and I'm driving around going, I should probably be on this  fucking list.  No?  How is it I'm not coming up?  This is so...  And then finally somebody called it, because you're really taking suggestions from the  callers, and then somebody called up and said, what about Kevin Pollack, usual  suspects?  And thankfully, you hung in there with the idea, with the premise.  Yeah, who else was mentioned?  Do you remember?  I think Robin Williams got mentioned.  Yeah, sure.  Jim Carrey's a good actor.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jim Carrey's terrific.  But it is a rare thing to do what you did. 
[01:57:30]  That's why I waved the flag so loudly.  Yeah.  Hey, look at me, you son of a bitch.  Meanwhile, it's the worst fucking thing I ever did to my stand-up career, was becoming  a dramatic actor.  Is that right?  Literally.  Well, because, careful what you wish.  You know, most comedians would, I imagine, if they want any acting credit, or street  cred, as it were, they want it as a dramatic act.  Sure.  We all want to be comedic movie stars, but if you want some cred, you're going to have  a little bit of drama to, you know, shake it up. 
[01:58:00]  All right, so I make a left turn about 20 fucking years ago with a few good men, literally  20 years this year.  How the fuck about that?  I saw that in the gym the other day.  Holy shit.  I'm like, I know that guy now.  Well, you can't avoid it.  No, of course not.  It's on every hour and a half.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  And so now I have to educate people that I started out in stand-up comedy and have been  a comedian.  All these, because literally, oh, look, it's the dramatic actor guy.  Well, I think it comes down to whatever happens to you, there's another road you didn't take.  Yeah, oh, sure.  You know, like, there's so many people that sit around going, why didn't I get my chance 
[01:58:30]  to do drama?  Like, Gleeson used to be pissed that he didn't get more dramatic roles.  What was the movie he did?  Gidget or Guizhou or something?  Yeah.  Or some weird movie.  He was very, very happy.  I think Laurence Olivier was in.  He did a movie with Olivier too?  I don't know.  I wouldn't know how to pronounce it either, but it is spelled like Gidget.  Gidget.  Yeah.  My ex-ex.  By the way, wouldn't it be a great world if that's how you pronounce it?  Yeah.  That would be fucking fantastic.  It makes it easy for everyone. 
[01:59:00]  Why not?  Gidget.  You've seen Gidget, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I never saw it.  I never saw that movie.  I fucked it the whole way through because I was a girl I was dating at the time that  made me and my fucking stoned friend watch it.  We just thought it stunk.  Watch this part.  Shut up.  That's, you know, 25 years ago.  He played Minnesota Fats.  Fantastic.  That was fucking unbelievable.  Who changed his name?  His name used to be something else, Fats.  His name was New York Fats, and he changed it to Minnesota Fats to match the movie.  Boring Fats.  Wow.  To match the movie?  I wish you would have stayed with it because I was at the edge of my seat, and I'm like, 
[01:59:30]  really?  That's the truth.  Yeah.  I love that.  So are people realizing you're a fucking stand-up?  No, but I mean, what happens is, you know, I'm at Caroline's this weekend, right?  So I'd say 60% of the audience comes out, will say, oh, I saw your new special last year.  It was great.  And then 40% will say, I love you in this movie or that, and I had known my friend drug me  here.  I didn't know you did stand-up.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, it's fucking annoying.  You still like it?  Because that's how I started, and it's my first passion, and making movies is exciting,  but boring fucking work. 
[02:00:00]  I mean, it's bullshit.  Right.  You sit in a trailer, and you wait, and then you go out and...  You'd rather do stand-up?  Oh, God, yes.  You kidding?  Taking the audience for a ride of your choosing live for an hour?  Fuck me.  I mean, that's it.  But a lot of guys don't want to do the stand-up.  They don't want the road, or they don't want the...  Yeah, a lot of them want off the road.  ...bad hotel.  Yeah.  You know, you want to sit home and count your money.  You don't want to...  Right.  You don't really...  So, but...  Yeah.  I would imagine making movies would be awesome.  In theory.  Yeah.  On paper, it's fantastic.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not even a job.  If anyone ever complains, actors or actresses, I just want to slap them for a day and a half. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  It's bullshit fucking work.  In fact, everyone on a movie set is working but you.  Right.  As an actor.  Everyone is pulling cable.  They're moving lights.  And you're just waiting for a trailer.  You're waiting for a donut, really, to get...  I hung with Jay Moore recently.  I was just amazed.  I was in his trailer all day.  They needed him for...  Right.  I mean, it took longer to walk to the set than him being on set.  But they were shooting around him.  They really didn't even want him to walk.  There was other people coming in and doing his scenes. 
[02:01:00]  He was playing the Charlie Sheen character for, what was it, Law and Order or CSI, whatever  the fuck.  And we fucked around in his trailer all day.  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, when are you working?  And they finally got him and we walked and he was on set and they're like, okay, that's  great.  That's it for today.  I'm like, you worked maybe five minutes today.  Yeah.  You worked 12-hour days minimum.  12-hour days.  That seems like a lot for your average working person.  11 of those 12 hours, you were absolutely sitting on your ass, waiting.  So how do you get yourself up?  Exactly.  To finally, you know, act? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know...  You must be bored and tired at that point.  Well, I don't.  I mean, I'm a comedian.  So I've managed to fool them through a number of films.  I don't know the exact number, 66.  But it's not...  It's not what it looks like.  It's both 66 movies?  I have five of them really good.  Wow.  My batting average could not be worse.  Who's the biggest actor you've blown a take in front of?  Oh, God.  All of them.  Oh, you have?  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, that's not as awful as it sounds because everybody...  But I'd rather hear the other side where the big actor stumbled in front of you. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Because I'm sure you've seen that, too.  Well, De Niro needs 35 fucking takes every scene.  Really?  Yeah.  And I'm asleep after three.  Yeah.  I mean, really.  You're going to get it from me in the first three or four takes, and then I just hear myself  talking.  Right.  And there's no longer...  There's no magic.  Yeah.  But he mixes it up.  He's doing something different every time.  And I want to kill myself.  35 takes.  Yeah.  We had that one scene in Casino where we're sitting at the table, and he's going through  the blueberries with the muffin, and he's not happy. 
[02:02:30]  But yeah.  I mean, it was exciting as fuck.  You know, sitting across from him was ridiculous, and I, you know, but seven hours in, you're  like, I think we got this.  Seven hours in, you're like, I don't give a fuck your hours, De Niro.  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure Bobby has nailed this.  I'll be honest with you.  And it's of his choosing, obviously.  Well, of course, that's how they work all these years.  They both like to do...  Scorsese's a perfectionist, Ron. 
[02:03:00]  Well, he, you know, him and...  I know Kubrick was, obviously.  Yes.  Yeah, but Scorsese gets to, you know, run his own show.  But the weird thing is, like, when they did King of Comedy, Jerry Lewis was pissed because  they would show up really late, and Jerry Lewis is old school, like, let's shoot this,  move on to the next thing.  And they, you know, they take their time.  They do their own thing.  And also, Jerry, you know, directed so many films, and he...  Right.  I think he was brilliant in King of Comedy, by the way.  I love that movie.  We all love that movie.  I think, yeah, it probably seemed like that's what he's probably really like. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  That, to me, was probably what Jerry Lewis was really like.  Yeah, I would go with that.  He reached down from Mount Rushmore about a year ago.  I got a call from my agent saying, Jerry Lewis wants your phone number.  He wants to call you.  I said, well, don't be a dick.  Give him the fucking number.  Yeah, why would you have to ask that?  Because, you know, it's like everyone.  You have to ask.  The president would like to call.  What are you...  That conversation should be, I gave Jerry Lewis your phone number. 
[02:04:00]  That's all it should be.  You don't need an in-between there.  Yeah, he's not my agent.  Give him the fucking number.  No, he is.  So, and then I get the call, and I'm not at my phone or whatever.  It's a voice message.  Hi, Kevin, Jerry Lewis.  Listen, they call me, and then the phone number, 702, whatever.  It's Vegas.  So, I call back, and he answers the phone, and it takes about a couple minutes for me  to realize that he's sitting in his living room, in his house, and doing nothing. 
[02:04:30]  And I don't know why I thought when you call Jerry Lewis, you go through three people, and  then he talks.  So, he says, oh, yeah, listen, I just wanted to say I saw your special, and it's terrific.  It's the best thing I've seen in 25...  Hold on a second.  I have notes.  I'm laughing my ass off, thinking this is the greatest.  He actually wrote out notes so he would remember what he wanted to talk to me about in the special.  So, when you come out, well, here it is.  When you come out and you kick the mic stand, did you have to join a separate union for 
[02:05:00]  that?  And he's killing me.  He's crushing me.  And, you know, you make fun of the guy.  You do whatever you want.  You know, he's been around forever.  He's done this.  He's done that.  But then when they actually make some sort of contact with you, now he's the Pope.  Now it's like, literally, you know, I'm floating on air with this crap.  And then he would call again a couple days later.  You know what was on?  A few good men what was on last night. 
[02:05:30]  Now he's literally my mother.  He went from my hero, my idol, to, yeah.  And then so he says, how do I get that special?  I want to show my friend.  Jerry, I'll send you one.  No, no.  All right.  I'll send you one.  And then he calls back and he ricocheted was on.  You were so good at it.  Literally, like.  He's a fan.  I mean, it was, but it was, it went from hero worshiping to, how do I not answer the 
[02:06:00]  phone now?  Where you want to tell him to get a life.  No, no, no.  Get a life.  Have you met him physically?  I still, yeah.  Then it led to a lunch in Las Vegas, which was amazing.  You know, it really was incredible because he, I started doing a little bit of research  on them because, you know, they, Martin and Lewis were literally as big as the Beatles.  There had not been a touring act to their magnitude.  And then I sort of asked him about it and he's, and he got into it. 
[02:06:30]  He got into telling the stories about he and Dean.  He said, we did, I think a 52 city tour in 60 days on a train.  And we had three cars.  There was a car for Dean and I, and then there was a car for our managers and marketing  people.  And then the band had a car, which you didn't want to go to unless you wanted to smile a  lot.  And he said, we, it was like a whistle stop tour, literally.  And every city they went to, well, you've probably seen that famous picture where they're 
[02:07:00]  hanging out the hotel window.  Right over here, which is the Hard Rock.  Right.  But that's the old Paramount Theater.  And how many thousands of kids looking at the bottom of it, like 10, 5,000.  From Martin and Lewis.  See, the thing is, everyone knows them from the movies, but when you see any clips of  their nightclub act, there's just nothing to fucking compare it to.  It's astonishing.  They were just, you know, going in every direction.  And the thing that kills me is like Dean Martin was fucking so funny.  Yes.  And he's the straight guy. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  He's the guy that's the anchor.  And he's funnier.  His timing is amazing.  And then he's the one pulling Lewis.  Wow.  It's un-fucking-believable.  Yeah.  There had never been an act like that since or before.  Right.  Where one guy is absurdly handsome and an amazing singing voice.  The other one is literally, I'll do anything to make you laugh.  Right.  Silly, ridiculous.  Right, right.  It's like Jim Carrey and George Clooney doing an act together.  Yeah.  How long were they tour together for?  10 years.  Oh, 10 years.  Exactly. 
[02:08:00]  10 years.  To the day.  And then they walked away from it.  Yeah.  Why did they walk away?  What's the story there?  They just were done?  Yeah.  I mean, because they were living together.  It's like the Beatles.  How long did the Beatles stay?  They didn't want to stick together for the money?  Because the fame was the...  Well, they did.  They did.  How many movies together during that time, too?  I mean, it really got to that place where...  They were still famous.  Get me out of here.  No, they were gigantic.  They still had juice, right?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Jerry went on to make a gigantic film deal.  No, I mean, when they broke up, they still had juice.  They could have continued that.  Oh, God, yes. 
[02:08:30]  They both went on to giant solo clips.  And everybody thought that Dean Martin was the craziest person in the world.  They're like, you have left the money.  Right.  Then he went with the Rat Pack, and then he got the TV.  But there was no guarantee all that was going to work, is my point.  We know now because of history, but here you got this great thing that you're just going  to walk away from after 10 years, assuming that you're going to do all right without  it.  But it's literally like the Beatles.  Right.  When the Beatles, they each went off and started working in the smaller clubs.  When...  Yeah.  And when they're egos of that size, you know, I'm just surprised they lasted 10 years. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's just, it's hard.  And when you look into the Beatles, you're just amazed any one of those guys wanting to  walk away from that.  But they did.  You saw the George Harrison thing, right?  We all saw that.  Yeah.  The documentary.  Yeah.  Where he just fucking had it.  He didn't want it anymore.  I'm like, you're one of the Beatles.  He just went to plant trees and plant tomatoes and shit in his garden and be left alone.  But how the fuck do you walk away from that?  Because it's like being in a submarine with other fucking guys.  You just want to kill each other after a while.  But it's the Beatles. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  I know.  But they don't see that from inside.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  I don't think you can ever have the appreciation while you're in it.  No, you can't.  For what it is.  Right.  I really don't.  Right.  You just get the, I can't go where I want to go.  I can't do what I want to do.  Right.  And Jimmy's right.  I've got enough money.  I listen to the show.  I listen to you guys go off on how fucking sick and tired you are of this bullshit.  Well.  I mean, it's management that you're tired of, I'm sure.  We're sick of being treated like zeros.  Yeah.  We want to be able to not walk somewhere.  I can go anywhere comfortably.  Yeah.  I'm sick of going to the store.  I mean, I can dig it, but you know what I'm saying? 
[02:10:00]  We know, and Ronnie, well, he could speak for himself.  We know what this could be.  Yes.  And it's just so complicated and hard now.  Not where we sit, but just everything around it.  Right.  You know, they just make it exhausting.  Yeah.  They really do.  It's almost like they're in a room somewhere, you know.  It's unbelievable.  With like a chart and a graph saying, how do we make this money?  And all we want is dumb little, like, lights in the studio.  So when we film videos, they look good.  We want maybe a bigger studio.  We're not asking for crazy shit. 
[02:10:30]  And everything has to just be talked about.  We just talk about things over and over again.  But you know what?  You don't think that somebody walked away from the Temptations and shit.  I mean, people do this.  Yeah.  All the time.  Like, no one.  Like, the Motown guys had no fucking idea that that was a great gig until it was over.  Right.  All of them were like, this is crazy.  But the Beatles.  The Beatles are the Beatles.  I mean, you know what I mean?  That's why Mick Jagger keeps getting every guy's together.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Right.  Right.  We really should never, ever stop.  Well, no one will show up to see those guys separately. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  That's the fucking funny thing.  Name one Mick Jagger song.  I mean, I'm sure you can, but not as impressive as those songs from the 70s.  Yeah.  All those fucking guys.  Doesn't compare to Gimme Shelter.  Look what happened with Pink Floyd.  Right.  And, you know, he goes out with his regular name, even though he fucking wrote all those  albums and shit.  Right.  And no one gives a shit.  But they're happier, probably.  Right?  Yeah, I guess.  Not being part of the machine.  Don't they want to see him at all?  Who?  Roger Waters.  Yeah, but not...  No, Rodgers isn't the best example. 
[02:11:30]  He did all right on his own.  Rodgers plays fucking, you know, 10,000 seat places.  Right.  He did all right on his own.  Or 5,000 seat places.  Right.  But he was playing stadiums with Pink Floyd.  And they go out without him, and they still play stadiums, because people just go, Pink  Floyd.  Right.  They don't know who the fuck made shit.  Right.  They don't even know who's in the band anymore.  Yeah.  We talk about that, where the bands are moving on without any of the original members at  this point.  Yeah, I remember actually Sam and Dave, neither Sam nor Dave.  Right.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Look, I remember that.  How did they get away with that?  For a while, there was no Sam.  It was a different Sam.  Right.  And then they came back, and it was a different Dave.  And in the end, it was just, neither Sam nor Dave.  Can I tell you the best part, Larry?  He thinks you're talking, he was hoping for a second you're talking about him, Sam.  Oh.  He used to do a radio show.  Half a second, he lit up like he thought it was him and Dave.  Yeah.  He has a show called Sam and Dave.  Oh, I know.  Leonard Skinner's at that point.  I think we're down to what?  Maybe one guy.  One guy.  One guy.  And fucking nieces and nephews in the band and shit.  But it's Leonard Skinner.  Right. 
[02:12:30]  And then the fans just look at it as Leonard Skinner still.  And they hired a guy named Leonard, just to have one around.  Particularly their fans.  Yeah.  I'm not all that fucking sure what's going on.  But they got one guy left.  That's it.  You know, these bands will be franchised.  I'm convinced.  Well, Kiss has two out of four gone.  I mean, Peter Christian, he's really been gone for years.  Right.  And they've kept going.  They've had those.  And Gene Simmons talked about on our show where he would love to franchise the actual  band and sit home.  Where he fucking, you know, cast the band, the new Kiss, and he sits home. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  That's what you need to do.  Well, we do that here.  We fucking franchised the show.  Gallagher tried it with his brother.  How about that?  Gallagher 2 or Gallagher Light?  What was it called?  Gallagher 2.  Gallagher 2.  Ron Gallagher's brother.  We, uh, God, have you ever talked to Gallagher?  It's been forever.  But, you know, 25 years ago.  He's a lunatic.  We fucking love him.  But he's a lunatic.  Sure.  He's got some fucking far out ideas.  You know who was great in here?  Uh, um, I don't know why lunatic made me think of this.  Because people think he is. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  You guys talk with Nicolas Cage.  I thought that was phenomenal.  It was phenomenal.  I thought it was going to be, uh, one of those, you know, pulling teeth things.  No.  He was great.  He was.  Did you hear him tell him the story about how he sat at a six hour opera crying to himself?  Yeah.  He went by himself to a six hour opera?  Yeah.  It wasn't even on though.  Huh?  That was on a Sunday.  Nothing was even happening.  Yeah.  He was just in the room crying.  And then he ends up crying.  It was so emotional to him.  He loves opera.  Who knew?  I love, uh.  Thank you, man.  I love his take on the whole Civil War photo bullshit that came out. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  And you see the Civil War photo, Ronnie?  Yeah.  He's a, he's a vampire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, I haven't seen the photo.  Yeah.  Oh, you weren't here that day.  I was in LA.  It was me, Ann, and, uh, Nicolas Cage.  That's when we get, there you go.  I mean, it's pretty, and I love how he says, it looks, it looks like a slow version of me,  you know?  Yeah.  That's, uh, that's.  Wow.  Is that a relative or no?  No.  How about, yeah, how about just going with that?  I might have a, I might have a family member somewhere down the pike instead of saying, 
[02:14:30]  no, he's a vampire.  Yeah.  Clearly the man is a vampire.  I mean, you kid, it's not possible to find anyone that looks like him.  Right.  That's absurd.  Yeah, let's go with that.  A billion people since the Civil War.  We found, we found your great, great, whatever it would be.  No, not possible.  No.  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Caroline's Kevin Pollack.  I think we're going to break here and, uh, continue with Kevin Pollack.  I'm, uh, I'm starting a new comedy podcast.  By the way, uh, I got to tell you about, but, uh, uh, oh yeah.  Am I doing that?  Because they asked me to do it, but I don't know if I can because I'm pulling back Sunday, 
[02:15:00]  uh, from Fort Lauderdale.  Well, it's, you want, uh, we all got invited to do Kevin Pollack's podcast.  I want to do it badly, but it's like Oscar night and all that shit to some shit.  I know.  I know.  But I'll tell you another day.  I'll tell you more about it when we come back.  Cause it's, uh, I'm pretty excited about it.  Fuck the Oscars.  I'll do it.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, maybe I, if Jimmy doesn't, maybe I do it then.  Well, let me tell you what it is first.  That's true.  Which you'll do after the break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  But we got to sell tickets for Caroline's.  I doubt it.  You're doing good there, right?  Um, it's not going to hurt to mention I'm there tonight, too, Sunday.  Okay, fair enough.  Caroline's.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100. 
[02:15:30]  More with Ron Bennington.  Come see the dramatic actor who's doing stand-up.  I'm leaving in line today.  Why?  Cause I have to get on an airplane at 11 to a flight.  But we're having fun.  Yes, we are.  I don't take it personally.  Man's got to move.  All right.  Fair enough.  You hit that.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  I need music to this.  I'm a hooter for the hooters.  I'm a fan of the glam. 
[02:16:00]  Just a knocker-gocker.  In other words, a man.  Try to look girls in the eye.  That is who I am.  I'm a cripple for the nipple and the part that don't get high.  For my reincarnation, come back and uplift bra.  I want to lug them jugs and be the women in the raw.  I want to hug them haystacks every little straw.  Squeeze them double-D's.  I'd be the chief me, squeeze them squaw.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Here's the action.  Three-something.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, that's a taste of reality from Kevin Pollack. 
[02:17:30]  Kevin Pollack is going to be at Caroline's tonight through Sunday, 212-757-4100.  And he wants to talk about, you've got a couple different podcasts going on?  Well, the Kevin Pollack chat show thing has been around, it'll be three years in March, so a couple weeks.  What kind of audience did you get for that?  We've had as many as 100,000 live, watching live, which it's an internet show. 
[02:18:00]  You get 100,000 people watching live?  As many as.  As many as.  He probably averaged more like 15,000 to 30,000.  Why did he get 100,000 that day?  What did he have on?  Sugar Ray Leonard.  We had Sugar Ray on.  How cool was he?  Amazing.  Amazing.  It was the second time you meet him and he doesn't remember you.  That's not humiliating.  Well, it's startling how much he remembers from every single fight from his entire life dating back to when he's, you know, a kid. 
[02:18:30]  That was the startling part for sure.  And then on the iTunes there, you could be talking about averaging near a million downloads a month.  But that's a bigger audience than what we're talking to.  No, no, no.  You don't think so?  You're getting over a million a day.  You're talking about.  Of course.  I don't know.  They never tell us.  Why would they?  That would allow you to negotiate.  Sugar Ray knows exactly how many people.  He knows everything.  People ask me all the time how many people you talk to a week.  They don't tell us.  I don't know. 
[02:19:00]  60.  I would like to think it's over a million a day.  I would love to think that.  I have no idea.  I guarantee it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm going to start the research today and I'm going to report back to you in a week.  Jimmy.  Well, let's hope.  He's got a plane to catch.  Let's hope at least a few hundred of them come out to show up at the improv.  And in one hour, my pre-sale happens for my Cleveland ticket.  Sorry to keep plugging, you know, PlayhouseSquare.org, April 28th, Ohio Theater, live one hour.  And I'll see you guys Monday, Kevin.  Great to see you again, Matt.  I hope I see you again.  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't there a password or something, though? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  For the pre-sale today, WMMS.  Nice.  Tomorrow, there's no pre-sale.  It's on sale.  It's going to sell out.  Yeah, I'm babbling.  All right.  And we're going to broadcast that.  Safe travels.  Safe travels.  Bye, guys.  All right.  I lost Jimmy, I guess.  That's it.  There he goes.  Bye, Rodney.  Good seeing you.  See you, buddy.  So what is Kevin's...  The new podcast?  Yeah, yeah.  I think this is the one I'm going to do live.  Wait, what's the old one?  Well, the chat show.  Kevin Pollock's chat show.  You're not getting rid of that?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  And what's that one about?  But that's a one-on-one conversation with, you know, everyone from Paul Rudd to Jon Hamm 
[02:20:00]  to Ivan Reitman to...  Well, you're ripping off Unmasked.  Everything.  That's Ronnie's thing.  Everybody, all the comics do that now.  I think it's perfect.  That's Ronnie's thing.  What, the one-on-one conversation?  Well, I know Unmasked was like that.  Ronnie invented that.  He invented the one-on-one.  I thought I was ripping off Charlie Rose.  I didn't realize I was out here two years after.  You're ripping off Ronnie B.  How long has Unmasked been around?  71 years.  It's the longest running show.  I know that feeling, though, because David Steinberg just started doing a one-on-one interview 
[02:20:30]  with comedians only on Showtime, and I went, what the fuck have I been killing myself for?  So I know the feeling you're talking about.  But the thing with Steinberg, he seems like he's putting eight into a half hour.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  Yeah, he's doing it like little clips.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you take the Unmasked to the podcast world?  We can't do it.  Why?  Because...  That's not part of your deal here, is it?  Yeah, it is part of my deal here.  Oh.  All right.  That's fucking...  It was not good.  Well, the thing is, is like, unlike all the other podcasts, I get paid to do it, though. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, true.  Yeah, it's different from actually doing a podcast.  You're much better off.  It's a weird world, man.  People can't figure out how to make money with the podcast yet.  You have to get your own sponsors.  Well, you get your own sponsors.  You get the Fleshlight yet?  It's good sponsorship, the Fleshlight.  Fleshlight?  Yeah.  I'm not talking to the right people.  They'll spend money.  I'm clearly not.  Joe Rogan makes some good money off the Fleshlight on this podcast.  Well, if I had Kevin Smith.  If I had a company called Fleshlight, I'd be throwing money around, too.  Yeah.  You know.  That's a Fleshlight you can fuck?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's okay. 
[02:21:30]  That's a terrific combination.  A Fleshlight you can fuck.  Who came up with that?  I'm ready to do it now.  I'll go to a library right now.  But they had to suggest that idea to somebody.  Right.  Someone had a fucking green light.  That's a pitch meeting.  Right.  And they said, you know what?  You're onto something.  A Fleshlight you can fuck.  Here comes Danny.  He has more info, probably, on it.  There it is right there.  It's the picture of the Fleshlight.  It's a Fleshlight you can fuck, right, Danny?  Well, sort of.  I actually know the story if you really want to read it.  Does it light up?  I do want to know.  Does it light?  No.  Maybe they sell an accessory. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, it lights.  If you know what I'm saying.  Actually, I had an opportunity to meet the CEO of Fleshlight.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty impressive.  Dude, he's a cool guy.  And let me tell you, man, they clean up.  I know they do.  They clean up.  They're fucking sponsoring podcasts.  How many guys are fucking Fleshlights?  What do you mean they clean up?  What are their sales?  Well, I saw their offices, and it was incredibly impressive, to say the least.  Right.  There was a lot of money floating around that office.  So that tells me that a lot of people are fucking plastic toys.  I'm just thinking if I'm going to go down that road, I would want the whole fake woman. 
[02:22:30]  Not just the flashlight.  Yeah, this looks like serial killer-ish.  I'm not bragging here.  I might have to fuck a spotlight.  Yeah.  Because I'm looking at that.  You're going with a spotlight.  Now, they have some fancy ones.  You know, you don't have to go all fancy like that, Ron.  You could just get the straight up, the black casing with the regular-sized pussy inside.  What's the story?  I got to know.  The story goes, this guy who made these, he was in Hollywood doing special effects.  Right.  So he already had experience with latex and different plastics and stuff.  And his wife got pregnant. 
[02:23:00]  And the doctor said it was a tough pregnancy and any kind of sex was going to be very risky  and could put the pregnancy at risk.  So he was going insane, trying to figure out stuff to fuck.  I'm serious.  So he had a flashlight, you know, it was similarly shaped, like a big, ever-ready flashlight.  Figured, hey, I could make a plastic pussy, shove it in there, and fuck the shit out of it.  And so he did.  And now he's a multi-multi-millionaire.  Is he really a multi-millionaire?  Without a doubt.  It shouldn't be that shocking to you. 
[02:23:30]  Without a doubt.  If you could figure out a different way for guys to fuck, you're going to make money.  No, I'll tell you this, too.  But I want to know the ideas that didn't work.  You know what I mean?  The flesh sander.  The flesh sander.  That one didn't work out so well.  The pussy that was shaped like a fire hydrant did not catch on, shockingly.  The flesh fish.  They had a truck that backed up into you with a vagina on the tailpipe.  That didn't work.  Now, let me tell you, one of the best things about meeting this guy was getting the factory tour. 
[02:24:00]  Because I got to watch all these old, like, Hispanic ladies, like, making these pink plastic pussies all day.  And that was quite hysterical.  That's the name of my fourth book, by the way.  That's so weird that you saw that.  And you do get, you do get a, like, a, a, a, what do I want to say here?  You get a consolation prize.  Yeah.  For visiting.  And so I got my own fleshlight.  Oh, nice.  And so I'm like, this is cool.  But I started to freak out because I'm like, all right, I'm in Texas.  I got to go home to New York.  I don't have any checked bag.  Like, I just have my carry-on.  So I'm like, so now I'm hoping, like, they're going to scan my bag through the x-ray.  They're going to see this weird. 
[02:24:30]  They probably have seen it all.  Yeah.  And that's what I was thinking.  That's what I was praying for.  Right.  And sure enough, nothing happened.  And I'm like, how do you not open my bag for that?  And so surely, I'm sure enough guys.  I've seen a million of them coming out of Texas.  Another fucking fleshlight.  No problem.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  We've seen it.  And I didn't use it for a while because I didn't want to be like, am I really going to  fuck this thing?  But then when I did, boy, was I happy I did.  Really?  It's a great product, my friends.  Do you build a woman around it, though?  I'd have to build a woman around it.  I mean, I guess you can. 
[02:25:00]  Maybe set up some pillows, something, right?  Like, you can take it and you can jerk off with it.  But that's dumb because you're just, you're still jerking off.  Yeah.  You're just using something to beat off with.  So my approach is you've got to wedge it into something.  Wait a minute.  So then you can fuck it.  Give me a pen.  Somebody give me a pen.  Yeah, hold on.  We're going to take notes there, Danny.  Couch cushion?  That's, well, my couch cushions don't separate, so I can't do that.  But yeah, you could do it if you've got a couch like that, sure.  This isn't different at all than you telling us how you fuck.  It's just as entertaining.  In case you're wondering, it's just as entertaining. 
[02:25:30]  I hear it.  The tour I loved hearing about, now that you're talking about how you fucked the flashlight,  I'm good.  Well, look, let me just get the check.  I am a big fan of products that work as advertised.  There's no lying in what this is.  And when it says it works and it's great, and then when you get it and it does exactly  what you need it to do.  I heard him tell the same story.  I'll endorse this.  He told the same story on NPR.  I don't get money from them.  It's just the same exact story. 
[02:26:00]  Fucking this.  You will not regret fucking a flashlight.  But there's a lot of things you can fuck, but this one is taking over.  Because they finally put science and technology into fake things to fuck.  Right.  It's no longer a banana peel in the microwave.  But you want a robot.  That's where you're going.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to have the whole thing.  It's not going to be enough for you.  I feel like it's a serial killer thing.  No, it's not that weird.  It cuts out the pussy and then fucks that and throws the rest of the body away.  Because, I mean, you're looking at porno when you're using this thing anyway.  So it's not like you've got tunnel vision on this extracted pussy hole. 
[02:26:30]  And what's the pussy modeled after?  Do they have...  Well, you know, they have different...  At the factory, they must brag about whose pussy this is.  Well, they have different sizes, I guess.  Like, you can get a normal puss, and then there's, like, the extra tight puss, and then  there's a...  So there's a cat.  There's a cat.  I don't know about the exterior who it's modeled after.  He's modeling how you use the...  Oh, God.  See, because they sell furniture that you can shove in.  This is why China's beating us, right?  That fucking three frame right now is what happened to this country. 
[02:27:00]  This is why China caught up?  Yes.  And why the Middle East hates us.  Yes, they have every right to.  We're looking at...  Wait, they also sell, like...  That looks like a gym horse.  You know what it is?  It's like a liberator.  You know those liberator things?  It's like the fuck furniture.  The wedges.  Yeah, and it's like you could shove the fleshlight in it.  Where do you keep this, though?  I know.  Where would this go?  In the living room?  Is it your fuck room?  Right by the fireplace?  Because I definitely don't want to go to the garage and get it and bring it in.  It's really fucking depressing.  And what lives in that hole when you're not fucking getting up? 
[02:27:30]  Dead cum.  Probably.  And that's the worst thing about...  The one downside to owning this is...  That's the worst thing.  You have to do something about it when all your fun has been over.  And when you neglect to clean these things up, it can get really messy and sticky really quick.  This has really been terrific.  Well, welcome to the Fleshlight Hour, folks.  Thank you.  We're getting you a sponsor.  No, no, no.  It's terrific.  I'm good.  We're going to be billing you for this.  It's a good product. 
[02:28:00]  Does it look like a flashlight?  Can you make believe it's an actual flashlight if your parents are over?  Well, you know, and funny you should mention that because there have been times where...  Mom, put that down!  Put that down, Mom!  I've neglected to put my flashlight away.  Have you?  But the top has been on.  I don't find that surprising.  So you can't see the glowing pink pussy on the top.  So there's like this screw top.  Well, it doesn't glow like a battery, but it's a pink.  It stands out in a room.  When you've cleaned it.  So as long as you've got the screw top on, it just... 
[02:28:30]  Who knows what it is?  It could be like a Big Gulp from 7-Eleven.  You'll never know.  Can we just shove a straw in there?  Can we compete with these guys?  You're going to have to come up with some really fuckable toys.  If you can get more guys like him to go around the country talking about it, this is like  the greatest vacuum salesman I've ever seen in my life.  They should pay you, Dan.  You know what?  When you could really get behind a product, man, you can believe in it.  I'm all for it.  I see what you did.  Get behind a...  I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry.  I don't...  We should do Snakes in the Can or something.  Go with Snakes in the Can and you fuck that.  Look, you can't knock it until you try it.  Yeah, all right. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, yes, I can.  I'm not going to fuck a flashlight.  Sorry.  Fuck it.  It's fun to fuck.  Yeah, no, no.  It feels good.  I went ahead and foolishly found a woman, but here's the thing.  You should be happy.  Well, who's stupid now?  You should be happy.  You should...  Foolishly found a woman.  Yeah.  I went ahead and found an actual person with a personality and a brain, but no, you keep  that flashlight handy.  I put the screw top back on it.  Put it right back in the bathroom.  Yeah, I'm so unbelievably happy for you.  And you...  I really am. 
[02:29:30]  It's...  You don't practice safe sex with this thing just to keep it nice and clean?  You know what?  You can't...  I have to.  I have done that.  And where do you put it?  In the dishwasher?  Well, you know what ends up happening?  You usually end up going, fuck it.  I don't feel like dealing with that.  So, you know, three days later, you put it on to the shower...  On like the shower faucet and just turn it on full blast.  That's no way to treat a pussy.  Well, I mean, look.  Is this a video of actually how to clean it?  Why don't you just throw it in the garbage with your dignity?  Just for...  I don't want to use it again.  Yeah, man. 
[02:30:00]  I listen to Joe Rogan and they're selling a shitload of these things.  What's that?  The cleaning fluid?  Cleaning fluid?  Cleaning your flashlight is very simple.  First, remove the flashlight sleeve from the case and run water through it.  Squeeze out the comb.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  Casting an English woman to do this.  Once clean, store the flashlight sleeve and case in a well-ventilated area so that your  flashlight will completely dry.  Following these simple care instructions will ensure that your flashlight will last your 
[02:30:30]  lifetime.  So here's the instructions in case you missed it.  After you're done coming inside of it, clean it.  Well, that's the lesson to be learned from this video.  Is this too much for you, Kevin?  No, I...  What do you want to talk about?  I'm...  You're still in?  All right.  I think this is a service that needs to be shared.  It's his enthusiasm that's getting on my nerves.  I don't know why you need to wave this flag this hard.  I think you're sending out a signal that may come back to bite you. 
[02:31:00]  Well, because...  He sprinted down the hall, by the way.  He couldn't wait to tell us.  Because there's so many fucking dumb masturbation products out there for men.  Again, this is a mystery in the universe.  There are...  Think about the sentence.  There are so many dumb masturbating things out there.  Well, there are, and they suck, and they're just as much money if you actually buy them.  Like, look, working for this radio show, a lot of weird shit gets sent in, and a lot  of weird shit is neglected to be taken home because of embarrassment or whatever.  And I have... 
[02:31:30]  Dude, I have no shame.  Any kind of dignity I had, like Ron said, left me a long time ago.  I have taken home plenty of things from this radio show to fuck.  You guys make pussies when you're growing up?  No.  You know what?  Ronnie?  No.  I never did, but a friend of mine...  Make them?  Well, I mean, you know, when you're like 12, 13...  You gotta do something.  Your hormones are out of your fucking mind.  Oh, yeah.  I did try to make something out of my tube socks rolled up.  A friend of mine did, he put pudding in a Ziploc bag and then put it in the microwave  for like 25 seconds, and then just not... 
[02:32:00]  He didn't fuck the pudding in the bag, but just the plastic that was just containing the  pudding.  I thought that was pretty clever.  There you go.  I just went there and back.  I'm going to be okay.  I want to take a knee if that's all right.  Well, Kevin Smith has a...  Well, he's...  It's Brian telling the Kevin Smith story, but Brian in Minnesota, go ahead, and then I guess  we'll move on.  Brian?  Well, first, Kevin Pollock loved you at Red State, man.  That was awesome.  Thank you very much.  Did you like making that movie?  Loved it.  I fucking loved that movie.  Yeah.  I really am super proud of Kevin and thought the film came out amazing.  Yeah.  Cool. 
[02:32:30]  Brian?  All right.  Yeah, Kevin Smith told the story on his podcast.  He's a big proponent of using the flashlight, and he forgot to clean it.  I think it was three, four days or whatever when he got back to it.  He said the comb was all gray and black looking, and a bunch of ants were eating.  There's a gift that keeps on giving.  Kevin Smith, you have got to be pleased with that particular unit.  When you're done, you can...  If the ants want your cum, you know you've got a winner.  The light is on you. 
[02:33:00]  I can't wait to ask Kevin about that next time he's in.  Shine a light on my cock.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So, the podcast.  Please, if there was ever a transition that needed to happen...  We're done with a flashlight?  Well, here's the thing.  You have anything else on it?  I can listen to this all day.  I mean, I can talk about the flashlight and tell them to you.  Yeah.  I want to know all the products that just felt miserable.  You want to hear the pitch sessions.  Yes.  Yeah.  Where they just looked at you like, no. 
[02:33:30]  You go inside of a box.  Right.  It's like the size of a refrigerator, right?  But without this freezer, refrigerator separation, you go inside and it fucks you.  Just, you can't, you know, there's dark in there.  You don't know what's happening, but trust me, you're going to cum.  But how does your product fail?  Because, you know what I mean?  Well, maybe using shitty, cheap plastic, cheap...  I think that is the bottom line.  A guy will fuck.  So, yeah.  It's almost impossible to fail.  If you haven't been foolish enough to find a woman who makes you happy and smile and feel fulfilled, 
[02:34:00]  then, yes, get a couple of rocks and...  And some pudding in a bag.  Yeah.  Pudding in a bag.  But this all started because podcasting, no one has figured out how to make money,  and Fleshlight is helping you guys out.  They're sponsoring podcasts.  So, we're going to get this sponsorship for you, Kevin.  I'm going to say no.  I'm going to say no thanks.  You're going to say no to this one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I met the CEO. 
[02:34:30]  I could probably hook it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love that you met the CEO and got the tour and got yourself one.  Fucked the shit out of it, too.  Yeah.  I sensed that you fucked the shit out of it.  Were the fake pussies just hanging up in the factory?  How many were there?  Are they coming off an assembly line?  Yes.  That's the funniest...  Dude, it was like watching how it's made, the pussy factory.  That was it.  I got to watch that episode.  The funniest, of course, is that that episode of how it's made will never happen. 
[02:35:00]  It will never air.  It will never be shot.  Right.  So, all the better to hear from you today on what it actually is like.  And how do you know if one's broken, where they have to take it off the assembly line  and throw it in the garbage?  Well, yeah, that means they inspect them.  They inspect them.  It really was an amazing setup.  I was quite impressed.  All right.  I got to go down to Texas just to go there.  I mean, it could be cogs or fake pussies.  I'm going to be impressed with that kind of setup.  So, kevinpollockschatshow.com.  That does great.  So, I'm going to launch a brand new comedy podcast live. 
[02:35:30]  So, the chat show is one-on-one.  Yeah.  That's long-form conversation, unmasked, very similar.  That was just the joke.  No, but it's true.  You know, you can get these people to sit down and talk for more than five or six minutes.  And in this case, you know, you guys have people come in here for an hour or sometimes  a couple of hours.  We like to do an hour usually.  Yeah.  So, I find it takes about an hour to break these people down and get them to cry.  No, I'm kidding.  Did Sugar Ray Leonard cry?  No.  We had him almost in tears.  He talked about, hinted that he might have been touched. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  No, that happens.  I mean, they get choked up talking about things without question.  So, I wanted to do a comedy podcast because this idea had kind of been kicking around  for a while.  So, you know, Jay Moore, when he does his impressions, what makes them great, and I would like to think  I know this about him, that he would agree, is when you find the impression that's conversational.  You know, it's one thing to do an exaggerated version of an impersonation, but when you can  get them into an actual conversation where they're not using a famous, you know, quotes 
[02:36:30]  or whatever.  Yeah.  That's when it becomes interesting to me.  So, like Jay, I've been doing Christopher Walken for quite a while.  And I'm not saying, if you Google the sentence, Christopher Walken impersonation, I come up  first.  It's not a competition.  There's 175 people out there that do a great Christopher Walken now.  Who's number two?  You know.  You know, because you're watching them closely.  I know you know.  Who's number two on the site?  No, who's number two? 
[02:37:00]  Some kid from YouTube on Google.  Oh, really?  On Google, if you look it up.  There's a whole page dedicated to Asian Christopher Walken impersonation, the whole YouTube channel.  Can I hear the Asian Christopher Walken for a second?  Hi there, folks.  It's me again.  The Asian British guy.  So, I had an overwhelming response to my poetry reader, which is very good.  I wasn't sure if you guys would accept a more serious side of me.  But apparently, you do. 
[02:37:30]  By the way, just playing this guy might make him number one.  And if that happens, I apologize ahead of time.  You son of a bitch.  I've had this bragging right for two years.  What's up with that?  Come on.  Just go Christopher Walken Linsanity.  You guys are doing a great job.  If I start complaining, you're going to start messing with the quality of my videos.  Set him on fire.  Is he doing the impression yet?  No, I'm not yet.  Come on, Seth.  But he has almost a million views.  When does he do the impression?  And then, ooh, the most fun part is Christopher Walken.  Please, I'll give you $47 right now to stop this. 
[02:38:00]  And put in, just type again, Christopher Walken impersonation and hit, there you go.  That's you.  You don't have to play it, though.  No, no, no.  Don't play it.  He's better than mine.  Yeah, yeah.  He's doing you.  Yeah, he can stop.  Yeah, yeah.  He can stop.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I can do it for you.  Now we're watching you do it.  But the thing was is that, you know, I wanted to do a comedy podcast, and I thought about  this thing where, so the thing is called Talkin' Walken, and it's just me and Ron, or me 
[02:38:30]  and you, sitting on stage talking about life and current events or whatever, but I'm only  talking as Christopher Walken the entire time.  I mean, it's as if you're sitting down with Christopher Walken for an hour and just talking  about everything from, you know, there's a man that walked into a Walmart, no clothes on.  It's weird.  It's odd to me, only in the sense that, you know, at what point do you make that decision?  I'm going to go with socks today.  I'm just going to wear socks to the Kmart. 
[02:39:00]  No, not socks.  Shoes.  I'm going to wear shoes.  And he committed fully, head to toe, soup to nuts, literally, naked.  It's a hard, but it's a commitment, so you've got to tip your hat.  Picasso was a hack.  Noses on the side of your face.  It's nonsense.  So I did the first one, and I'm going to launch it on iTunes, I think, Friday or Saturday.  They're always tricky about how long it takes them to upload once you give them the stuff. 
[02:39:30]  But then I'm going to do it live on stage Sunday night.  It'll be the first time live in front of an audience.  And I'll take questions from the audience as well.  But it's not really an interview.  It's a conversation.  The first one I did was with this funny guy, Matt Myra.  He's either half a nerdist with Chris Hart.  Sure.  And we just literally sat in my dining room for an hour and a half, and then I edited it down about 48 minutes or whatever.  But, yeah, it's just – it's the conversational side.  That's what always made an impression interesting to me. 
[02:40:00]  You know, you can always do the exaggerated version or use the quotes from films or cowbell.  I mean, stop it already with this.  You know.  Anyways, so it's called Talkin' Walkin'.  We're building a site this week, Talkin'Walkin.com.  Oh, very cool.  And it's I-N on Talkin' and Walkin' because I don't want to get sued by his family.  He loves it.  Yeah.  One of my stories in the act – God forbid you get down to Caroline's this weekend.  I'll go.  Please.  Is meeting Christopher Walkin when he got his hands and feet and signature in cement in front of the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. 
[02:40:30]  I was asked to be one of the two speakers at the ceremony.  The other speaker was Quentin Tarantino, of course, directed him in Pulp Fiction.  I'd never met Christopher Walkin.  So I don't know why I'm invited.  You would assume that you would have before then.  You would assume that we had met.  But the fact that we hadn't met, I was honored beyond belief to be asked.  But I know I'm there because I do the impersonation, right?  But I don't know what he thinks of it because I'm sure this wasn't his idea.  Oh, you know, get that kid who does me. 
[02:41:00]  I don't see that happening.  So I show up, and I'm nervous, and I see him in person for the first time.  I shit myself instantly.  It's him, you know.  And he sees him.  He goes, hi.  They told me you were coming.  Thanks.  Thank you.  And the whole time I'm thinking, it doesn't matter what he says because he's using the voice.  Right.  I mean, I'm crying.  And then we're standing next to each other for like 10 minutes in silence.  He doesn't say anything.  And now it's getting weird and creepy because no one's talking. 
[02:41:30]  Because that's a long time for silence.  And then finally he turns to me.  Oh, I said something lame at the beginning like, congratulations, hand the feet in the cement.  Very, very cool.  So after 10 minutes of silence, then he finally turns to me and he says, cement.  Wow.  And that was it.  I'm on the floor, pissing myself, laughing because he actually said it.  You know, it wasn't someone doing a bit.  Right.  And then I got to do the story of how on Halloween night when kids come to the door, I answer the door as Christopher Walken to try to scare them. 
[02:42:00]  I got to do that story in front of him, in front of the press, at the ceremony for him.  So to do the impression of him in front of him in that weird way and out of the corner of my eye seeing him sort of lean forward at the waist laughing.  Right.  That was one of those you can take me now moments.  But isn't that a tough – that's a tough spot to be in.  Well, when you have the real ones there, there's no reason for an impersonation.  Right.  In fact, the big part of the act is me telling stories now about my friends think it's a great idea to do them for them. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  It's a horrible idea.  It's a stupid idea because they're them.  It doesn't matter how good you think you are.  They're better.  They're better as a rule.  Right.  Like I did A Few Good Men.  We talked about it.  All my friends who knew I'd been doing Nicholson and my stand-up back before that would call – when I was working on the movie, they would call every day.  Did you do Jack for Jack?  You got to do it for him.  He's going to love it.  He's going to love it.  You got to do it.  Again, friends, stupid.  Idiots.  Why would I do Jack for Jack?  Why would I be the one millionth dickhead in Nicholson's face saying, this is what you sound like? 
[02:43:00]  Like, you know, who would be that fucking – to be anywhere near someone like that, let alone working with them.  And does anybody even think they sound like they sound anyway?  Like most people hear their voices and go, wait, that's me?  Yeah.  You know, so to think, like, I remember growing up in Philly, I had no idea there was a Philly accent.  Right.  I thought we'd talk just like Johnny Carson.  So it wasn't until after we –  Middle America.  I grew up from there.  Right. 
[02:43:30]  That I started to hear the accent.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  Alan Arkin.  Alan Arkin said, you know, if you notice since you started doing me, I stopped stammering.  I don't stutter as much.  I just talked directly and without stopping or thinking.  I used to – I hated the sound of you pausing and thinking about it.  Yeah.  Sometimes I –  I got to ask.  Did you end up doing Jack to Jack?  Was there just a moment?  No, there was no way in hell because I was convinced he was going to say –  I just assumed that maybe he let his guard down one day and you went, ah, what the hell. 
[02:44:00]  What if he doesn't like – because it was so – honestly, it was so thrilling to be anywhere near someone like this, let alone have him consider me a fellow professional working on this thing.  I'd rather talk to him about, you know –  Did he know you did him?  I don't know because I never asked.  You know what I mean?  I had done it on The Tonight Show with Carson.  I mean, it was out there.  No, I know.  It was out there.  He could have seen it.  That's for sure.  He must have saw it.  But, yeah, he told me the most amazing story.  Oh, God, I've never told this story.  I just realized. 
[02:44:30]  While we're working on A Few Good Men, the news breaks on Magic Johnson, his HIV, while we're working on the film.  So everyone, of course, on the set, all the crew, everybody, one at a time is coming by Jack to either say, hey, man, sorry, because you know he's Mr. Lakers.  Or say, what the fuck?  What does this mean?  You know, because a lot of people just couldn't wrap their brain around it.  So the whole day, Jack's kind of walking around in a bit of a fog.  And, you know, there's base camp where the trailers are. 
[02:45:00]  It's always a little bit of a walk from the stage.  In this case, we shot on a soundstage or the set, wherever you are.  So, you know, Jack was one of those enigmas to me where I wanted to leave him alone.  I didn't want to force a conversation on him.  If it happened, it happened.  I didn't want to, you know, I don't like bugging people because I'm still that kid who can't believe he's there, honestly.  So, and especially with that film, for me, it was like being brought up to the majors, let's face it.  Everybody in the movie is famous except for me.  I remember actually Robert Reiner. 
[02:45:30]  You weren't famous then?  Well, I mean, I had done Avalon and I had done some things, but that movie was a juggernaut.  You know, Nicholson head to toe to toe with Tom Cruise.  I remember Robert Reiner said to me while we were sort of prepping, he says, listen, Jack's going to be swinging for the fences because he doesn't, you know, that's the way the character's written.  He's going to be in all his glory.  Tom's going to be swinging for the fences to keep up with Jack.  Demi's definitely got to swing for the fences to try to come up with those two.  I need you to hit like a double into the camp.  Get on base. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, just get on base.  That was so great.  So we're walking back to the base camp where the trailers are, and this one particular day where the news broke about magic and Jack's all bummed out is the day that I find myself walking alone with Jack back to the trailers.  We just got both released at the same moment or whatever.  People stand around, have a conversation, and then he and I are walking side by side back to the trailers.  And again, I'm not starting the conversation. 
[02:46:30]  It's a weird day already for him.  So he's walking, and he just keeps saying, it's surreal.  It's just surreal.  The whole fucking thing is surreal.  And we get closer to the trailers, and we pass his first.  And he puts his hand on the door.  He's about to enter his trailer, and he stops.  He turns back around.  He says, you want to hear a story about surreal?  And I'm now like, are you fucking kidding me?  Jack Nicholson wants to tell me a story about what he thinks is surreal.  Why, yes, Jack. 
[02:47:00]  Let me pull up a fucking chair.  Wow.  So I said, yeah, sure.  And he says, I'm doing this picture Chinatown.  Already I'm done.  I'm done.  This is, I'm doing this picture Chinatown.  Might have heard of it.  And I'm rehearsing this scene with John.  He's talking about John Huston, who directed it.  And he's saying, I'm doing this scene with John.  Oh, no, I didn't direct it.  Polanski directed it.  John Huston acted with him in the movie, as well as the scene.  We're rehearsing, and while we're rehearsing the scene, I look over his shoulder, and about, 
[02:47:30]  I don't know, 30 yards away off in the distance, walking towards the set is his daughter, Angelica.  And I had just started banging her a couple of weeks before, and I hadn't figured out a  way to tell the old man.  And you have to understand, I would have killed for him.  He was like a surrogate father.  He was everything to me.  And I remember, how am I going to tell him if I had, it was so upsetting, you know, because 
[02:48:00]  if he had asked me to kill her in that moment, I would have done it.  That's how much he meant to me.  And as I'm thinking about all this, I come out of my head, back into the rehearsal, right  as John Huston says to me in the rehearsal of the scene, Mr. Giddish, are you sleeping  with my daughter?  That's fucking surreal.  And he spins around and walks into his trailer, and I'm standing there like,  Did anyone else hear this?  Did this just fucking happen? 
[02:48:30]  Blew my shit anyway.  I don't know why I've never told that story.  That's a great story.  Probably because he mentions he was banging a junkie.  Yeah.  Don't want to be disrespectful, but there you have it.  But he was with her for how many years?  Forever.  After that, yeah.  Long time.  Yeah.  Nobody bigger, right?  Nope.  And Jack, nobody bigger.  Also, how are you cool to five decades?  Right.  That's the real brain fuck.  I mean, he was cool out of the get, you know?  You know, I was at a prize fight where it was fucking tons of celebrities.  I think it was Hall of Field and somebody in Vegas. 
[02:49:00]  And literally, when fucking Nicholson just came in, everybody turned.  All these celebrities.  Even the celebrities.  Turned and go like, Jack.  You can see fucking celebrities go, Jack Nicholson's here.  Yeah, because you see that a lot when you see celebrities that won't turn for other celebrities.  Yeah, because.  But when they do, then you know, oh, fuck.  That's greatness right there when they're turning their fucking heads, too.  Because Kevin's right, in like 1969, people were like, there's fucking Jack Nicholson.  And it's never stopped.  70s, 80s, 90s, the O's, and now. 
[02:49:30]  And now, whatever we call this.  How the fuck do you stay cool to each generation?  It's impossible is what it is.  Sure.  It's literally impossible.  And never done an interview.  Only in print.  Never appeared on camera his entire life to give an interview.  What about the Carson stuff?  That's a step.  What about the Carson stuff?  Never did.  Never did.  You never did Carson?  I'm telling you, never did anything on camera, ever.  He never did Carson?  Never did Carson.  I was just assumed he did.  No.  Isn't that something, though?  Imagine, again, part of the mystique.  I think that's part of what kept it so cool.  Wait, he never sat down for an interview. 
[02:50:00]  I'm not kidding.  I'm learning this today for the first time.  You would.  No, I believe you.  You would read, like, in, you know, Esquire, GQ.  Yeah, he gives great interviews.  Playboy, all that stuff.  In print.  Those guys are weak.  But I even remember when they started, like, when stuff like E! Entertainment yelled stuff  to him as he was going in and he would just say something on the way in.  That seemed weird to me.  Right.  Because it was so long before, you know, you would only see pictures of him.  Well, here's the question.  Why do you think that's what he did? 
[02:50:30]  Because he wants to be a fucking movie star.  He wants to be an actor and a movie star.  He's old school and I think the belief was, if you get on camera and talk about yourself,  people will know that you're not as cool as they thought you were.  Right, right.  I mean, honestly, it happens immediately.  You can't compete with that.  No.  Just some of the characters he played, probably.  Yeah.  And the fact that we would go make up our own rumors about what his life was like.  Right, yeah.  You know what I mean?  That would be probably bad.  But how many other guys never did an interview? 
[02:51:00]  You know what?  I think it took, like, even De Niro a lot of years before he started doing it.  And now, I wish he didn't.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, when you see him.  We joke about that.  Jimmy and Ann, you know, joke about that all the time.  He falls apart as soon as he has to talk.  Even Marlon Brando ended up on that stupid Larry King interview.  Yeah.  That was pretty cool.  And he held out forever.  But I remember seeing recently.  That was a moment, though, don't you think?  A clip.  Oh, yeah.  He did all right.  Oh, yeah.  Showed how weird he really was.  Yeah.  Which was great.  Everyone assumed.  Good point. 
[02:51:30]  But it was Richard Burton, I think, was interviewed by Cavett.  Or, no, Merv Griffin.  Merv Griffin went to the set of some film and sat down with him.  And that was weird, seeing somebody like that who, you know, there's a weird mystique.  I don't think it exists today, which is why you have all these.  Oh, man.  These guys got to do a million interviews for every project.  That's the fucking problem.  They just have to.  There's 15 of them every, like, during that week, you'll see them on every single show.  And, you know, some of these guys repeat stories. 
[02:52:00]  And a lot of actors aren't personalities.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, I think maybe De Niro, that's the thing.  Like, he's kind of empty and then fills it with the character.  But I always wondered why they didn't invent, like, a talk show character.  You know?  Here's the guy who comes out and does the talk show.  Do you hate when you interview someone on your show and you think you're getting something real and thinking, oh, that's unique.  And then you watch them later on a TV show and tell them the exact story.  I'm like, fuck, seriously?  Like, did you have a good time here at all? 
[02:52:30]  Or are you just kind of, like, going through this in a robotic motion?  Yeah, I only get original stuff.  It's fucking amazing.  It's amazing.  Well, the unmasked, certainly.  You know, you break them down.  But when you're doing a regular radio interview.  I never think about it as breaking down.  I assume I'm pulling something out of these people.  And then you go, no, they were planning on telling that.  They were just waiting for their opportunity.  Not kidding.  I never told the story about it.  No, I've.  No, no, I'm saying.  You broke me.  Oh, thank you.  So I know it's not going to go in the annals or the annals.  But.  Interesting. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  We're going to do one more break and continue with Kevin Pollack, who's at Caroline's tonight through Sunday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Live on stage Sunday.  One of you two guys is going to be with me on that stage.  Either one of you.  You're both welcome.  Whoever can make it.  I'm serious for the talking, walking.  Were you raising your hand?  And we'll just sit around and shoot the mic down.  It is the Oscar night, though.  It's an Oscar night.  I know.  That's a rough one.  What time is it?  It's counter-programming for all the people who don't give a fuck that the artist is going  to win every Academy Award.  Don't roll in it for me.  See, I am. 
[02:53:30]  Did you like the artist?  The fix is in.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course I like it.  It's going to win a shitload of awards.  It's going to win everything.  And no one saw it.  It's going to win everything.  I saw it.  I saw it.  Did you like it?  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  I did, too.  By no one, you mean America.  Oh, the mainstream.  Well, they're waiting.  Yeah.  It's only playing the Paris.  It's been at the Paris like in fucking 1978.  Who's going to sit?  It stays in the same pan.  But how are they going to sit through a silent movie?  It's astonishing.  Just the masses, I'm saying.  But that's the accomplishment to me, is how the film got made, how it got marketed, and  how people invested money in a movie, that knowing the same thing that we're now saying, 
[02:54:00]  which is America, the nation, will not go see this movie.  I loved it.  Yeah.  Of course.  You really felt like you went in a time machine and watched what people used to watch,  silent movies.  It was magic.  What are you going to do?  Oh, let's talk about that after the break.  Other movies, Oscars, Jeremy Lin.  Are you part of the Linsanity?  You know what I love about this kid is that the Chinese – I heard this on the news somewhere.  The Chinese version of Twitter, he has over a billion followers. 
[02:54:30]  A billion?  And they think the reason that it's exploding to that degree is – and his popularity there  throughout Asia is that unlike the previous Asian basketball stars who were centers, this  kid's 6'3", and his prowess is now considered attainable.  He's that kind of inspiration.  You know?  Right.  That's one of the reasons the guards get more money usually.  Right.  Not usually, but in a lot of cases.  Well, when they looked at Yao Ming, they're like, no, none of us are going to be 7'2", 
[02:55:00]  or whatever he is.  Exactly.  They love basketball in China.  Yeah, they do.  The last Olympics when they're fucking chanting MVP at Kobe for no – and Kobe's like, what?  This is fucking great.  Yeah.  So this kid now represents, well, you can do this too because he's 6'3".  Right.  So he's – it's beyond hero.  It brought me back, man.  I tapped out for easily 10 years with the Knicks.  I'm so in.  I was starting to take a peek.  Of course.  It's exciting.  I was taking a peek when they grabbed Carmelo Anthony and Stoudemire, but now with Jeremy 
[02:55:30]  Lin, I'm watching every fucking game.  I haven't done this in – I can't tell you the last time.  Yeah.  The Pat Ewing years.  And that's happened within a couple of weeks, right?  John Sark's years.  That's astonishing that it happened within a couple of weeks.  Isn't it?  Here's what's funny, though.  If fucking LeBron would have came here, it would have been madness, and he's just realizing  that.  Right.  Like, you know, no one gives a shit that he's in Miami.  He was scared.  Scared of failing here?  He's just scared in general.  All the talent in the world, but just a scared guy. 
[02:56:00]  I've been watching him this year.  He's a fucking animal, man.  Are you watching basketball?  Yeah.  Can you talk him out of that beard, you think?  No.  I think it works for him.  It's like a black lumberjack.  What do you think for tonight?  Nick's Heat.  The Heat's going to crush them.  I think so, too.  They're fucking unbelievable.  I got it.  I don't think anyone's stopping them.  I think so, too.  I mean, the Knicks are still trying to figure out what all this means and trying to put the  pieces together here.  And I don't know how good this Lin kid is.  He's good, man.  I think he's fucking good. 
[02:56:30]  I'm telling you, you'll have to watch the game tonight.  I don't disagree.  I think it's going to be a tough game for the Knicks.  Down in Miami?  Yeah.  You know, of course, LeBron and Dwight.  If they beat Miami, this fucking place is crazy.  Oh, my God.  As a matter of fact, they might even get a call from the commissioner and just say,  lay down and let's keep this fucking T-book thing going.  Dude, Knicks beat the Lakers without fucking Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony early on in  the whole Lin thing.  A couple days in. 
[02:57:00]  I think that's kind of what sparked it.  I think that's kind of what set it on fire, that game.  That exact game.  Well, when Kobe's saying, I don't know who this kid is.  Yeah.  What's his name?  That was fucking great.  That was just great.  But what an asshole.  He knows.  Yeah, of course he knows.  Yeah.  Like, you know how we make believe we don't know all the radio guys?  Of course we know all the radio guys.  Well, not so much these days, but they're all gone.  All right, Kevin Pollack, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Caroline's this weekend, Thursday through Sunday.  I've got to figure out which show to go to.  You got an early show tonight?  Eight o'clock?  Yeah. 
[02:57:30]  Come on out, you son of a bitch.  Tonight might be the night.  Let's do this.  You want to go see some comedy tonight, Ronnie?  Me and you hang?  I'm going to do a little show here.  Then you nap.  Do a little nap.  We go see Kevin Pollack?  Maybe I'll do that.  Let's hang.  This is not uncomfortable, Sam, in case you're wondering.  I'm good.  I'm fine with this.  Good.  Sam, are you going to see Kevin Pollack?  Of course.  You're lying.  Well, I don't have tickets in my hand, but I would like to.  You do now.  But now all of a sudden.  You know how funny he is?  You couldn't have more juice.  Yes, I've been sitting here.  Of course I know how funny he is.  I didn't know how funny he is when fucking Danny took over the show. 
[02:58:00]  I thought Pollack was going to be a lot stronger.  I like the Danny segment.  We learned a lot about the flashlight.  What's wrong with that?  He got to go to the factory.  Come on.  If we didn't have Kevin Pollack booked, we would have done an hour on that.  I just wish, and I apologize to the listeners who wanted an hour on that, but I must say,  I just wish the kid had a little enthusiasm for the fucking flashlight. 
[02:58:30]  All right, we're going to wrap up next.  Stay there.  You know him as Vinny's lovable uncle from MTV's Jersey Shore.  Oh, what the fuck?  Now the Sicilian funny man brings his act straight off the boat and on to Broadway.  Listen, I got to say something.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Let me fucking talk.  Uncle Nino presents Bad Jokes and Wine.  I've been drinking all fucking week.  We're making toast to the crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  You can scrub it from here to hell.  You never get rid of that fishy smell.  I'm fucking for me.  I'm fucking for me.  I'm fucking for me. 
[02:59:00]  Come see what nobody else will as the stereotypical Italian recites line after line of adolescent toilet humor.  First time I had sex, I was so scared, I was all by myself.  I says, I was with this guy.  He says, honey, is it in?  He says, yes.  Well, stop walking towards me now.  Oh.  I ask this guy, he says, buddy, did you ever see the numbers on the condoms?  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll the back down for you.  Wow.  Never before has an offensive cartoonish caricature told so many bad jokes in one hour, writes the Daily News.  Oh, wait. 
[02:59:30]  What do you call, what do you call a fact, Jake?  Chuck.  What the fuck?  How come only brothers can play basketball?  Because you got to know how to steal, run, and shoot.  Yeah, he's, he's insulted.  What the fuck?  I laughed once, then wondered why I had, said the New York Post.  Yeah, I have to say one last thing.  I'll shut up.  Yeah, it's probably I'll shut up.  I got it.  Listen, I love black women.  I always think you're shutting the dog.  And when asked, the New York Times said they didn't bother to show up and review it.  I was with this guy, I says, miss, did you ever have a 60-second orgasm? 
[03:00:00]  He says, no.  So you got to fuck a minute?  What the fuck?  It's Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine.  Hey, God bless everybody.  And who gives a fuck?  Live on Broadway for as long as people still give a shit about the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, the fuck?  Sirius XM, you're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question. 
[03:00:30]  Talking to Kevin Pollack today.  Caroline's tonight through Sunday, 212-757-4100.  And then Kevin Pollack's chat show dot com.  And then I got to remember this.  Talking.  Walking.  Talking Walking, right.  Sure.  TalkingWalking.com.  Coming to your computer soon.  And the iTunes.  I think we're going to launch Saturday a new comedy podcast called Talking Walking.  I just started downloading podcasts.  And I'm going to download a few of yours today. 
[03:01:00]  I just started.  I avoided all that because I'm thinking, wait, sure.  This is radio.  That's what we do.  Why am I going to listen to other people's radio shows?  Everyone's killing themselves to get into radio because they can call it a podcast.  Andy Warhol was very close.  Right.  When he said everyone would be famous for 15 minutes, everyone will have their own podcast  for 15 weeks.  And for some reason, if you tell people you're in radio, they'd like, ugh, you're barely  in entertainment.  But if you say I'm podcasting, it's the same fucking thing.  That's so cutting edge.  Right.  You guys must be so fucking fed up with the podcast shit. 
[03:01:30]  Well, here's what really kills us.  The one hour a week as opposed to 20 hours a week for 20 fucking years.  Yeah.  You know?  No, no one paid their dues.  I mean, we've all been in the trenches doing something else.  Now we're going to dabble.  That would make me crazy if I was sitting in your chair.  And all these guys that, you know, do our shows, they're now competing with us.  Because now our listeners are now downloading their podcasts instead of listening to Ron  and Fez or Opie and Anthony.  I'm like, what?  Go on here.  I think it's like when, like, fucking Norman Mailer had to watch, you know, like, people 
[03:02:00]  were, like, blowing his books off because, you know, Fonzie writes a book and suddenly  Norman Mailer was like, what the fuck?  Fonzie writes a book.  I'm fucking busting my ass over here.  But you're right.  The big difference earlier that you mentioned is 100% true and it is sort of the dividing  line.  Yeah, you guys are getting paid.  Yeah.  You're making a living.  And they had some living at that.  No, we're good.  You know, you put in your 20 years and you make a living because you put in your time.  You're getting paid because you've earned it.  And the rest of us that are dicking around with these podcasts should not be getting paid and we're  not. 
[03:02:30]  As much as I bitch, yeah.  It's still great what we do.  There's only one smart guy away from figuring out how to make money for everybody.  I know.  That's what we're all waiting for.  There's just one guy because, believe me, everybody in radio would walk away in a fucking  heartbeat if this guy came up with how to do it.  Right.  There's a new system now where they're tracking city by city the downloads.  So I think that's where the difference starts.  You start to see actual numbers.  Well, I'm brand new to this new system.  So I'll report back to you hopefully soon how this is working.  But they'll tell you, you know, when I say there's a million downloads on iTunes, that's 
[03:03:00]  a trackable number.  But I don't know where the fuck these down.  They're coming from all over the world.  Right.  But when they say you've had 10,000 in Austin, Texas last month, then that becomes a thing.  Yeah.  And that's where you guys are making your money because your numbers are going up in these  clubs.  I guess, I guess it's all marketing.  Everything's driven by fucking marketing.  You know how it is.  I have my first book comes out the Christmas time.  Yeah.  How I Slept My Way to the Middle.  Come on.  It's a funny title.  We're laughing.  I don't know what the book's going to be, but it's a funny title. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, you don't even know it.  No, no, no.  I'm going to start with the title and I'll figure out everything else.  I've been working on it for a year.  It's, you know, it's secrets and lies from life in the biz.  Stories.  Yeah.  You got a lot of stories.  Like the one with Nicholson.  That's in there.  That'll be in there.  So our listeners don't have to buy the book.  No, no.  I'll just come back.  I'll just come back and eventually I'll read the entire book.  But Ronnie makes a point, like with the podcast and before we move on.  Sure.  These guys are doing an hour a week and keeping their audience.  Right. 
[03:04:00]  So I'm like, why do we have to do 20?  And then Ronnie was telling me off mic, you know, you do, you do four hours a day.  Let's say three are like over the top.  Just fucking you're in the zone.  You're Michael fucking Jordan.  And then it's fucking flashlight for three hours.  And then the last hour is like, I'm trying to think of another, like a kind of middle  of the road NBA guy.  It's just, it's just there and okay.  They'll fucking focus on that.  Motherfuckers.  Or you do four hours of great radio and it doesn't matter because by tomorrow you got  to do it again.  Yeah.  And then these guys are podcasting one hour and I'll get to another one next week. 
[03:04:30]  Like you even said, like you're going to bring your flashlight back thing.  Oh, fuck yeah.  People will be like, Jesus Christ, again with flashlight.  Yeah, but we'll add something to that.  Haven't we fucking heard that?  Twitter's the worst thing that ever happened.  I would never go on it.  I don't go on anything.  I'm only on it because I'm a narcissist.  Oh, I am.  I'm not on Facebook because I don't want my friends to know what I'm doing.  My friends are idiots.  Fuck them.  You get a fan page though.  There's a fan page.  Yeah.  There's a fan page on Facebook.  The wonderful Lane Ewing. 
[03:05:00]  Give her a shout out.  She runs that.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you know, it's a plugging marketing machine.  Again, I'm on Twitter because, well, same with you, you know.  I like cool.  I spend most of the time retweeting funny people, to be honest with you, and then I'll plug some shit.  It's really weird to see people like Albert Brooks fucking writing jokes on a daily basis on Twitter.  Well, I've talked to him or Gary Shanley or Steve Martin.  Actually, Joel McHale and I, we did this awful, it turned out bad. 
[03:05:30]  But it was a good on paper movie with Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson, the bird movie.  Yeah.  Oh, it wasn't good?  It was good on paper though?  Oh, yeah.  Can I stop here for a second?  I thought the trailer was great.  I saw the trailer and then...  It looked bad.  It's much harder.  It's much harder.  But it brings up a point we've talked about over the years, movies that were supposed to be outstanding and failed miserably.  You guys know when you look at these scripts, like, oh, this is a no-brainer.  This is going to work.  So then what happens?  I hate to be tried about it, but comedy is timing. 
[03:06:00]  And the timing and delivery of a joke within a conversation in the storyline of a film is as delicate as timing on stage.  If you flub a word in the punchline, the joke's gone.  And then you have to make a joke about how you fucked up the punchline.  Right.  But it happens live, so at least there's something happening.  In a film, when you get to editing, that same delicate moment by moment that you have the audience and then, ah, you made a left turn.  You should have made it right. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  It's so much more fucking hard than you have any idea how to cut, how to edit a funny moment.  Are you on the person's face who receives the funny to see their reaction?  Is that why it's funny?  Or on your person's face who's making the funny and then we don't know what the other person thought?  Yeah.  It's really, I'm telling you, it's that simple.  You really got to pick the editor more than anything else.  You're like, I need a really good editor.  The person, the director and the editor both have to have genius timing of comedy to pull off comedic moments in the film.  I really, really feel so.  What about this, too? 
[03:07:00]  Because like you said, it's all about timing.  When you have to do a funny line over and over again, do a lot of takes, does that fuck it up?  Guess what?  It gets less funny.  It does, right?  So now you have to be a really good actor to go, wait, I laughed genuinely the first time,  but now we're 10 takes in.  Now I got to go back and make believe it's still funny.  Yeah.  Some people get better take after take because they find new juice, new angles, new ways to work it.  Whole Nine Yards is brought up to me a lot as a fun film that I did with Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. 
[03:07:30]  Because Matthew had been doing Friends for years and years and they have a process of,  when you're working on a sitcom called Beat the Joke,  and the writers will write jokes in front of the audience.  They'll keep, someone will keep trying to come up with a better joke, a better joke.  So they get in that mentality of beat the joke, beat the joke.  And on the set of that, almost every line that's quoted back to me by fans on the street from Whole Nine Yards  will be a joke that literally Matthew Perry said right before, as the camera, you know, the guy says,  roll sound, Matthew will say, say, don't belong.  What?  Just say, don't belong.  And then this is quoted back to me for the rest of my life. 
[03:08:00]  When you say, don't belong, and he says what?  And you go, don't be long.  Literally just thrown as the cameras crank it out.  Spontaneous.  So that, you know, some people just get better.  They get experimental and that magic just fucking happened.  Is there a problem with making movies look perfect, that it fucks up comedy?  Because I feel like when we were growing up, you know, some of these great comedies we loved,  they were kind of like a little dirty.  You know what I mean?  They weren't perfect.  I think the lighting might not have been perfect.  Someone might have slightly flubbed something, but they didn't care because the joke was there. 
[03:08:30]  The Hangover is a good example of not giving a shit what it looks like and just going for the funny.  Just getting funny people.  Todd Phillips, I think, the guy that directed that.  And realize if you do 20 fucking takes, you're really going to fuck up the chemistry or the funny.  Todd Phillips clearly doesn't give a shit what his movie looks like.  Yeah, I think that's important.  I mean, I don't want to slap his DP in the face.  No, but I think that's a...  But he just goes for the funny.  That's a compliment.  Right.  Because you see some of these comedies, they're so polished that it's like,  what happened to the spontaneity of the humor of the comedy? 
[03:09:00]  Isn't it weird how many times a dramatic movie will almost be funnier than a lot of comedies?  You know what I mean?  Like Goodfellas or Glengarry Glen...  You'll just laugh at those movies more.  But if you'll even see sometimes a comedy and watch it again a year later, you're like,  what?  What the fuck was I laughing about?  It got lost on me.  Yeah.  You know?  It just went away.  Do you think about Schmitt's a comedy or a drama?  I think it falls in, but I'd laugh my ass off.  I'd laugh my fucking ass off. 
[03:09:30]  Every time Dirambutu comes up, whatever that fucking ass is, I'm crying.  But I went to a theater in Huntington to see this movie.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  I'm howling in the movie theater.  I think I went by myself.  We might have been off the air at that point.  I had to fill up time.  And there was a lot of older people in there.  No one's laughing.  I'm like, what do you think you're seeing here?  Am I not seeing this properly?  Because I thought the movie was hilarious.  But maybe they were thinking that they're going to die soon.  And they were looking at it as a drama, I guess, which certainly there are those moments there. 
[03:10:00]  But as far as black comedy, man, that movie's hilarious.  To me, I felt that way about No Country for Old Men.  Really?  When that crazy lunatic's walking around with that air tank blowing people's heads out.  And he has the crazy scene with the guy in the gas station.  Right.  I'm laughing uncontrollably.  I think it's such a great dark comedy at times.  I'm laughing so loud that when the film ended, some guy gets up in front of me and looks back and says,  Yeah, well, I guess I'll have to see the film again.  Really?  I swear to you.  I swear to you.  Because I have an annoying laugh. 
[03:10:30]  Not on purpose.  It's just when it's organic and real.  Yeah.  I just go, ha ha.  I mean, literally, that's just how it comes out.  And in the movie theater, apparently, that can be annoying.  I saw, I was watching Modern Romance with a fucking girl, and I'm, like, crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  And she's just staring at me with fucking daggers.  Like, how could you think this awful man is so fucking funny?  Right.  And I literally had to, like, gasp her.  Like, this is never going to work out.  By far my favorite Albert Brooks movie without compare. 
[03:11:00]  And if you've ever been in a fucked up relationship, it's the best movie you've ever made.  That's not fucking true.  Right.  Well, you're not going to wear that to work, are you, honey?  Well, we have some sewing to do.  There's men out there.  They rape.  That's all they do.  They just rape.  Yeah.  It is so fucking dead on when you're at your worst.  Yes.  And anyone who doesn't get that, you know that that person, and you've got to stay away  from each other.  What about Fargo?  Same shit.  Fargo is funny.  I'm always hit, man. 
[03:11:30]  Hilarious.  Kills me.  Right?  Kills me hilarious.  You know, we were talking about Nick Cage.  I think Raising Arizona does not have a set-up line in the whole fucking line is a bunch  line to make.  Every line is the fucking line of the movie as you're watching it.  I've got to see that movie again.  It's so fucking strong.  It's ridiculous how funny it is.  And then you'll meet people who will be like, I don't get it.  People don't act like that.  It's just weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the books will have stories. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  You've got a lot going on, Kevin.  Secrets of Stories and Lies.  A movie also I wrote with the director.  You like Midnight Run, right?  I love it.  It's a great comedy.  The guy who wrote that, his name is George Gow, a terrific writer.  I wrote a film with him that he directed called Columbus Circle.  It's a little psychological thriller with Jason Leeds, Yvonne Rubisi, Salma Blair, and  some other great people.  And it comes out on the Blu-ray DVD March 6th.  Are you in it?  I'm also in it, yeah.  Oh, good.  Columbus Circle is the name of that one.  You like it?  Yeah.  I thought it came out.  It's kind of a Hitchcock kind of thing. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  So, you know what?  Iron's in the fire.  Right.  You know, I made the foolish mistake of being a stand-up comedian who had fantasies of being  a dramatic actor, and suddenly that worked, and then shit on my stand-up career.  So I realized I had to keep out a lot of balls and plates in the air.  I was going to say this after the show, but I'm going to say it on air.  Like, I blew off Kevin Pollack doing our show forever.  And then he finally did it last year, and you remember our conversation.  I'm like, dude, I owe you no apology.  You obviously worked with this show, and I was just stupid. 
[03:13:00]  But you said something today that made it all make sense, that I started looking at you  as just a dramatic actor.  Yeah.  Right.  And you said that, which, and it fucks up your stand-up.  How about the curse of care for what you wish?  I mean, it's a perfect example.  I mean, I wanted nothing more.  But when you said that today, I'm like, it finally all made sense to me.  Because I'm like, why would I say, why would we say no to Kevin Pollack all these years?  You know?  Because he was just a dramatic character actor.  What do I give him?  I'm going to have Joey Pants in here? 
[03:13:30]  My loss, simply, you know?  But, you know, we figured it out.  Well, I appreciate that beyond words.  So thank you.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'll be back tomorrow.  Is that good for everyone?  You can come back tomorrow.  I think it's just me tomorrow.  So whoever wants to do the show.  Ron?  You in?  We don't have anybody to do tomorrow?  We might have Jeffries, maybe.  I think Jim Jeffries.  Jim Jeffries?  He's great in here.  He was here a couple days ago.  Last week.  Last week.  So we take advantage, get him on as much as possible when he's on the East Coast.  Ron, you want to come back for another set?  I got to do this thing today. 
[03:14:00]  What thing?  And then we got the big announcement.  Yeah, I got to do my show.  And I got a big announcement.  How about you do...  Oh, you have to do tomorrow's show.  We got a big announcement tomorrow.  Yeah.  With you and Fez.  Not good.  Not good?  No.  No, not good.  Why would you give that away?  Why would you just...  Why would you say it's bad?  Why...  I figured it was a 50-50 shot.  I have no idea what the announcement is.  Oh, you really don't?  You made that up?  Yes.  Jesus, you should be in movies.  Thank you.  You totally fucking had me.  Thank you. 
[03:14:30]  The way you said noo.  It was after the not good.  It was a noob.  And then your reaction brought it...  And then you fucked it up, Ron, because I went 50-50.  I'm like, it's either good or bad.  I'll go with not good.  Well, I was going with a whole different way.  Oh, were you?  Oh, you gave it away.  Oh, okay.  That was going to make...  So you're right.  It's going to be my own thing.  I'm like, everyone's going to be like, holy shit.  Even Opie thinks it's bad.  It is fucking bad.  It is bad?  That's the problem.  So now I don't know.  Now we're all confused.  All right.  You're both in the next film.  The thing is...  Yeah, thank you.  ...there's so much they're doing with science these days that you're never really out of it. 
[03:15:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, every day, a lot of somebody could be coming up with something new.  That's what I see.  And if we crack the code on how to make money off podcasting, we can all retire.  That's all we're looking for.  Yeah, I could handle a one-hour-a-week podcast.  It's a pain in the ass every day.  Yeah, I guess.  I guess if you want to know the truth.  I wonder if you're going to start bitching about an hour a week, too.  Like, I don't fucking believe it. 
[03:15:30]  Then forget it.  Just move on to something else.  I honestly think it's going to be shorter and shorter.  Like, Sam will be doing 30-second fucking things by the time he's, you know, good enough.  How about you just blow out 10...  Imagine just blowing out 10 minutes.  That'd be nice.  10-minute set.  We had a lot of good 10-minute sets today, Rob.  People...  Yeah, people, you know, when...  Just think, if there's a YouTube video sometimes, if it says five minutes, you're like,  I don't have five minutes for you, dude.  I think... 
[03:16:00]  Let's get to it.  I know when I first launched the fucking chat show online,  the computer geniuses, the internet gods were saying, no, no, no, not more time.  You don't want to do more time on the internet.  You want to do less.  Yeah.  You want it to be viral.  I said, no, it's not going to be viral.  I'm going to sit down and talk to people for a couple hours.  Right.  I said, yeah, no, no, bad idea.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  I think the world has changed where if you do less radio, if you're a fan of the show  and, you know, we do less radio, that frees them up to do other things.  I'm serious, because there are guys, they're like, fuck, I got to listen to all 20 hours. 
[03:16:30]  I think that's crazy, but they have to.  Right.  So if you knock that down a little bit, you're freeing them up to maybe check out a Kevin Pollock  Cut it back to two hours or something?  You want to cut it back to two hours?  I'm thinking two hours would rule.  Three hours would be easy.  Two hours would be perfect.  All right.  I'm making a call.  Four hours, four days a week.  Here's what you're doing.  Three hours a day.  Twelve hours a week.  I can do that.  You sit down with Christopher Walken and you're talking just for an hour.  Walk about anything.  Oh, look.  An apple.  How do these guys? 
[03:17:00]  I got to ask.  It's Walken, Talken, right?  Talken, Walken.  Talken, Walken.  I-N-I-N.  How does the guy get in on the conversation?  It's because it's just two guys talking.  But you as Walken, you don't know when to jump in.  Well, no.  See, that's it.  Yeah.  But honestly, that's the only hurdle the other guy has to get over, which is you literally  are just talking as we are right now.  Right.  I'm not going for the joke.  It's just like you were saying, drama ends up being funny.  Right.  The way you were just talking and conversationally, that to me, the subtlety of that, that we're 
[03:17:30]  not set up punchline, set up punchline.  We're just literally talking about...  And seeing where it goes.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if you read the story.  There's a girl, her and a boyfriend, Valentine's.  They had a bondage fantasy where he left her in the car.  That was the fantasy.  She's naked, duct tape on the mouth, zip ties around the wrists.  And he goes down the block and has a smoke.  And people drove by, they see the girl in the car, they call nine, nine cars, nine patrol 
[03:18:00]  cars eventually show up.  And the couple has to admit, well, it was just a fantasy of ours.  And the cops said, you're weird.  You're strange people and you're going to jail.  It's not good.  So again, I would be horrible on this show.  Because all I would...  You'd be strong.  You'd be good.  No, all I'd want to do is just listen to you.  And you'd go, oh, right, he needs something from me.  No.  I'm just...  I have a huge smile.  I love his walk-in.  I'm just sitting there like dumbfounded. 
[03:18:30]  How do I get in on that?  I get ridiculous, like, bizarro world stories that you pull from, you know, every day.  When you guys...  Four hours is so fucking intimidating to me.  So there's got to be daily stuff that comes in that you're looking at.  That's, you know, that's kind of it.  We just pull some stuff to talk about.  Well, we'll be checking it out.  All right.  Talk and walk.  Talk and walk.  Talk and walk.com.  Coming soon with the I-Ns.  That's how you spell them.  Yeah, because I don't want his family to sue me.  Right.  I know he likes it.  Well, open house tomorrow. 
[03:19:00]  Whoever wants to come back.  Ronnie's fucking blowing me off.  How about you do one set?  Coming around nine.  About nine?  And then you slide into your big announcement.  All right, yeah.  All right.  I'll come in at nine.  How about eight?  I got you for nine.  Let's go for eight.  Well, you're going to have Jeffries, right?  Yeah, I don't know what we're going to talk about.  He's a weird dude.  You want a comfort zone.  No, I like Jeffries.  I'm fucking around.  I think he's going to do very strong for you tomorrow.  Yeah.  I'm getting a lot of buzz about it right now. 
[03:19:30]  Jimmy's gone.  Jimmy's down where Anna Nicole Smith died.  He's doing that area.  You're losing partners one hour every hour.  Holy fuck.  Another one's fucking leaving you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam, you doing radio tomorrow?  I don't think so.  Oh, thank God, because they don't want you on the air.  Exactly.  I'll be back at eight.  Come on in.  I'll come in at eight.  I sense it.  I want this look, though.  You want that?  She's dead, though.  Well, what happened?  The eye patch.  The eye patch lady's dead.  Come on.  Why just pirates? 
[03:20:00]  Why can't they sport an eye patch and be...  You think that look will ever be cool?  The eye patch?  Eye patch.  They've been trying forever.  Is there something else we could do for the one-eyed people?  Just asking.  I'm just going to say it.  I'm just going to say it because it's all your listeners are thinking right now.  Yeah.  The fuck flashlight.  Boom.  Right in the eye.  Boom.  There you go.  All right.  We're babbling now.  So, Kevin Pollock will be...  We know.  We know that much.  Yes.  We know when we're just fucking staggering to the fucking... 
[03:20:30]  Love you guys.  This is a thrill for me.  Thank you.  Kevin Pollock.  Kevin Pollock's chat show dot com is definitely happening.  You get that on iTunes.  It's at Kevin Pollock on Twitter.  Live every Sunday.  You retweeted one of my lines, by the way, and I'm going to fucking say that made my fucking  night, man.  What do you mean?  I've retweeted you several times.  I know.  No, no.  Please.  That is like...  That was fucking big for me.  Thanks.  David Wayne, the new movie Wanderlust with Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston. 
[03:21:00]  And the guy who wrote and directed that, David Wayne, he wrote it with Camerino.  But David Wayne is going to be my next victim on the chat show on March 4th.  Nice.  It's live every Sunday afternoon.  Nice.  Literally streaming.  You think that movie's going to blow up from this weekend?  I just saw it and I hope it kills because...  You liked it?  I'm not kidding.  It is hilarious.  And it has that delicate balance of being silly and then there's a little bit of a love  story there.  And they don't shove it in your fucking face or down your throat.  It just happens and you're like thankful for it because the movie is so silly and funny. 
[03:21:30]  I just did Kevin Moreno on The Unmasked.  Love him.  He's amazing.  He is really so fucking brilliant of a guy.  Oh, I remember you plugging that he was going to be on because you were saying, I don't have  to tell you that it's anyone about this because the ladies want this guy and he's coming in.  Everybody from the state has this cult following.  But the thing is, I was just telling you today, he wrote the thing Diggers a couple years ago,  which is a real kind of straight film Moreno wrote about Long Island clam diggers back in 
[03:22:00]  the 70s.  I just think it's really fucking solid.  Diggers is a good movie.  Yeah, it's really solid.  I'm going to check that out too.  It's almost like a fucking 70s film.  Wow.  You know, it's just, it's kind of got like a diner breaking away.  Right.  Feel about it, but real blue collar stuff.  And then he wrote this film and it's really, I saw it with a full audience and they were  fucking going crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I hope he.  Wanderlust.  Hilarious.  Yeah, I hope he gets a big fucking pop out of it.  Because I haven't, I haven't. 
[03:22:30]  You'll laugh.  I promise you.  I haven't wanted to see a movie in a long time.  I promise you, you'll laugh.  It seemed like a shitty year for movies.  It was not a great year, which is another reason that I give a fuck about the Academy  Awards.  Come out to Caroline.  Oh, nevermind.  We might have to do Caroline's now, Ronnie.  You're doing all this stuff.  We might have to do Caroline's.  Unless that fucking ugly dog comes out and dances around the stage from the artist.  That would be reason enough for me to show up.  Right.  That fucking dude is amazing.  You might have to see that, uh, that they're banning, uh, Borak, the fucking.  Really?  Yeah.  He's not.  They pulled his fucking tickets.  Persona non grata?  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Why?  Because.  Sasha Baron Cohen you're talking about?  Yeah.  They thought that he was going to show up in his character and walk the.  The dictator?  Yeah.  That looks hilarious to me.  And, uh, they're like, you're not going to fucking market your show here.  Really?  They yanked him.  And now they look like dicks.  Of course.  And everyone's pissed off.  So he's getting the press he wanted.  Anybody doesn't have to show up.  He doesn't have to do it.  That's what you got to do.  You got to create a stink and then not have to come in.  I like that.  I like that a lot.  I want to just franchise the show.  Find a new Ope.  New Ant.  Younger.  Faster.  Faster. 
[03:23:30]  Faster.  Better.  Yes.  Of course.  Bigger flashlight.  Yes.  It's all that.  All right.  We're out of here.  Kevin Pollack's going to be tomorrow.  Coming back in tomorrow.  But it's Caroline's tonight.  Tonight through Sunday.  212-757-4100.  And of course Ron Bennington.  Fuck.  Thank you so much man.  Sure bro.  And maybe we'll see you tomorrow.  I hope.  And it's the iBang on Twitter.  The iBang on Twitter is.  Have you explained that to our audience?  The whole iBang thing?  It's just like a funny website. 
[03:24:00]  It's really good.  Have you checked out it?  Yes.  I absolutely am.  I got some of the interviews on there and stuff too.  iBang.  The iBang.  Yeah.  The iBang.  It's unique.  It's different.  Is that like the iBang?  Is that what I hear about?  That is it.  That's the iBang.  But when I'm with Opie, I have to really break it down to what it would be.  I say the iBang so they go to Twitter.  And then all the links are on that Twitter.  That's why.  Oh.  See?  That's not bad.  Why didn't you go with the iBang for the fucking Twitter account?  See, he can't.  It's iBang. 
[03:24:30]  It's in Tarot.  Oh.  In Tarot.  Hey.  And then he interbangs me.  They didn't hire him out of Harvard.  Get off the phone.  So, but the only way that he will...  The iBang on Twitter.  Yeah.  The only way that he'll go to it is if a tweet happens.  Sure.  And you'll see it.  Yes.  But that's how we all are.  We're lazy.  No.  So tweet more links.  I'll tweet constantly.  Please do.  I got to meet Fez now.  He's here.  You're going to meet Fez.  Oh, I'm excited. 
[03:25:00]  And then he's going to line up the Unmasked for you too because he produces the Unmasked show.  Okay.  And then the big announcement tomorrow.  But it was really great hanging out with you today.  Real pleasure.  And thanks for not tanking on me that day on the air because I was driving the car last night.  I would never let you down, dude.  Thank you.  You didn't.  Big, big fan.  That was awesome.  Well, I'm going to go fuck your mother and have a snack.  Here you go.  Boom.  We'll see you tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Guess what?  We're back on.  What do you mean this asshole?  Me and Kevin are, like, kind of bonding.  We'll bond then.  I love that.  We're becoming friends right in front of your eyes.  That's what I want to know.  And you don't know how to fucking turn the mics on so everyone else hears it.  You're the one who's here. 
[03:26:00]  This is a small talk, the real talk that happens after the show.  That's what people want to hear.  We were talking politics.  Is that why it's called After the Show?  That's right.  They want to hear what goes on after the show.  But he pins me in so I can't even leave.  And next thing you know, I'm doing more radio.  I don't want to do more radio for these guys.  I have Travis right here.  I know.  I can't get out if I want to.  And then I got to get through Roland.  And then one of the bosses is outside the studio.  I don't know how to get through this obstacle course.  Let's go talk to him.  Yeah?  Tomorrow we have sandwiches, too.  What?  Tomorrow, DeFontes is bringing sandwiches. 
[03:26:30]  Roland is the only talent booker that gets more excited for the sandwiches than the guests on the show.  How about you book tomorrow's show?  It's just me so far.  And now Kevin, officially.  And sandwiches.  You're by yourself tomorrow, but we have sandwiches.  But now I got Kevin.  What kind of sandwich?  Any sandwich.  A whole tray, like five trays of sandwiches.  Five trays.  Doesn't matter.  It's the quantity, not the quality.  As for flavors, I got a number.  I'd like one good sandwich.  I don't need five trays. 
[03:27:00]  Listen, if you can't find one good one out of 75 sandwiches, you can't find one good one out of 75 sandwiches.  Good point.  They're assembly lined.  But what does that say about their business, that they have to send five trays,  so hopefully you find one good one.  They're all delicious sandwiches.  They are delicious.  All five trays.  You can vouch for every sandwich.  Look at me.  Yes.  Okay.  You're right.  Who else is coming in tomorrow?  I'm good with just me and Kevin.  But not the flashlight thing again, right?  No, no.  Well, honestly, if it gets a little slow, we're going to go for it.  Tomorrow is the day we're going to revisit.  Yes.  That's how I know things are going well.  Yes.  Get it back in here with the tour. 
[03:27:30]  Yes.  Everybody's on the road.  We got all our tricks.  Trust me.  We'll break our Oscar picks tomorrow.  Did you do that already?  Really?  I didn't see a lot of the movies, man.  Me neither.  That's why it's good.  Didn't see it.  Didn't see it.  When the show's going slow, we make fun of E-Rock and how fat he is.  Remember Bill Murray used to do the...  Huh?  Bill Murray used to do his Oscar picks on the news update on SNL 100 years ago.  And he would basically say, this is a movie here.  I didn't see it.  And he'd just knock it off the...  So that's crap.  Makes it easy to pick a movie.  It really does.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  Am I witnessing, though, also not only this friendship being built, but Kevin going from  guest to co-host after basically one appearance?  Well, what else am I going to do?  I mean, it's a great thing.  If you can, you know, ride with being blackballed from the show for 10 years...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get to come on and be the co-host.  And then prove your...  Oh, God.  No, you know what?  I'm unbelievably touched that you brought it up on the air, because I had no idea any  of this was going on.  No, I was going to tell you off air, like, I didn't understand why we said no to you, 
[03:28:30]  because I've always been a fan of you, to be honest.  But you said no.  Yeah.  Okay, I don't blame you.  Character actor, dramatic.  What's he going to come in and talk about?  What it was like to work with Tom Cruise?  But that became who you were.  It becomes...  And you said it on the show today, and I went, that's why.  Yeah.  Because the fact is, Kevin's a funny guy.  Did you know he was a stand-up, or did you just know in the movies?  Yeah, I think so, but I never saw your stand-up.  Right.  And I liked your roles in movies.  Right.  But we like funny...  We just like funny people on our show. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, I get it.  As a fan of the show, believe me.  But, you know, some of these roles are like, well, he's not that funny.  Yeah.  He's good.  How are we going to get laughs?  Is he going to come in and reenact the scene?  It's stupid on my part.  No, no, no.  Dumb.  Don't put yourself down.  That doesn't make anything better.  You know what it is, though?  It's good radio.  I'll be putting himself down.  Yeah, why not?  I can't believe he's literally blocking your path.  Are you blocking, Travis?  That's what he's here for.  Is he allowed to leave?  No, not yet.  What else do you want to ask?  Eric was trying to get me to shit stir.  E-Rock was talking to my headphones while that was going on. 
[03:29:30]  About what?  He wanted me to ask you what other guests you've turned down.  Wow, that's a great...  I forget after a while.  Yeah.  Who have I turned down?  My soul is too sad to bring it down.  Yeah, Rowan remembers every single name on that list.  I have nightmares about it.  I'm like, sometimes we turn down guests because we don't want just a show filled with guests.  We want to just hang and do our thing.  Who, Rowan, who's been the hardest for you to say now?  Who has consistently turned down?  Whose name was brought up many times when he went, you know what? 
[03:30:00]  I don't see it.  Oh, I know.  Oh, Travis knows.  Jeff Garland.  This is a bad topic for you.  This is a no-win for you.  Jeff Garland was the name that Travis just mentioned.  I like, you know.  He's funny as fuck.  Yeah, I know.  I hear.  I'm not impressed with him on Curb.  He's funny.  You got to turn it up a little, Jeff.  Turn it up if you want to make it in here.  Kevin, is he really funny on the stage?  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  He truly is a naturally funny guy who can kind of riff about nothing.  Oh, fuck.  Or anything.  Yeah, yeah.  What a dumb...  Made another mistake.  He was hilarious at Caroline's.  Was he?  Yeah.  Who else?  You had Norm from Cheers in here, and you wouldn't have Jeff Garland?  We're trying to have an intervention with Norm.  It didn't go too well.  It really went poorly.  It's the worst interview I think we've ever done.  No, Jeffrey's in Norm throughout.  Huh?  No, I was thinking of that.  No, that was...  Yeah.  Norm just came in here depressed.  Oh, man.  It was really sad to see, because I was a huge fan of Cheers. 
[03:31:00]  And I called him out, and I was like, no, I'm all right.  And then Jim...  Tell me about it.  Jim answered my...  And it looked like he was drinking all night.  I don't know.  I don't feel like getting sued.  But he was writing a book about drinking.  Right.  Like, that was what he was promoting.  Yeah, a book on beer.  So I figured, well, he looks like he might have had beers last night.  Maybe only a mere couple hours ago, because we start so early.  And then Jim asked him, like, legit questions of, have you ever thought about, are you an  alcoholic?  Like, are you?  You know?  And that was completely the wrong direction to go in for him. 
[03:31:30]  And it got worse from there.  That was not what he was feeling at the time.  And then after the interview, we hope some of you guys do an ID for us.  He's like, no.  Yeah, he walked right out.  He said, no IDs for these guys.  I didn't mean to go down that road.  It just got weird that day.  Yeah, it wasn't like a prank interview.  It just went wrong.  Like Paris Hilton.  This is why Jeff Garland is scratching his head.  Huh?  This is why Jeff Garland is scratching his head, saying, I can't fucking believe I can't  get on the show.  Now we've got to get Jeff on.  Norm wants to kill himself.  Yeah.  And I can't.  And I can't be booked. 
[03:32:00]  Are you getting yelled at?  What's happening?  He rocks waving his hands around.  What is he?  He just won't talk.  No, I was just telling Roland to put his headphones on.  Why?  Why?  When he talks, he moves away, and you can't hear him on the mic.  It's the after show.  It's all good.  Does it matter if we hear Roland?  That is true.  Half the time, you don't know what he's saying anyway, so it's better it's off mic.  Lin-mania.  Who was the most painful one for you to say no to?  There's a list.  Which one?  I don't name names because publicists listen, so I don't name names.  No, publicists listen to the after show.  Nobody listens to it. 
[03:32:30]  I don't name names.  Yeah, but sometimes we say no because we're overbooked or whatever.  Or sad.  Or sad.  Also, you don't have to give away who said no.  Right.  There's three people.  The question is a name that...  Like a strong name that you were just like...  For many reasons, might not have made the show.  One that you were kind of counting on.  This is great radio, by the way.  I know.  I just can't...  You're thinking about it.  Yeah.  I know.  There's a few of them.  I'm trying to think of them.  Because you've had to turn down people in this building, like the day of. 
[03:33:00]  By the security...  He has the worst job, without question.  Yes, absolutely.  For this reason.  Or somebody went by a security desk and said, oh, hey, can you get a cup of coffee?  I'm like, well, on your way out...  Like, what about...  What's his name?  Anthony Michael Hall.  Or Anthony...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was downstairs...  What happened?  What was the story?  What happened?  He was down on Karak Lobby, and then you go, I don't want him. 
[03:33:30]  And I go, I just bring him to the green room, and you're like, no.  Is he the dude from the John Hughes movies?  Yeah, yeah.  That guy?  But vacation.  Come here and talk about the Chevy Chase movie, Vacation.  Yeah.  I'm holding a grudge, because when we got...  When we did the Sex for Sam thing at NAW, the next day when the whole world was literally  talking about us, he actually canceled on us, because he thought it would not be good for  his fucking image to be on our show.  It was his publicist who did.  He didn't know about it.  And to be fair, probably wouldn't have looked good for him to be on your show at that  point.  Good point.  Yeah, and he was very, very... 
[03:34:00]  But you don't live in my head.  That's right.  In my head, it seemed normal.  Yeah, yeah.  To do the show after this big, huge controversy.  And maybe an important moment to show a little support.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's when you find out who your real friends are.  Why did we say no that day if we said yes?  You said he...  So they said yes to booking him.  Yes.  And then he got to the building.  I said, I'm going to go...  You said, where are you going?  Okay, I asked Michael Hall.  You're like, give me a minute.  All right.  Then you're like, no.  Don't bring him up.  Because you remembered, literally five minutes before he was going to be on the air, that he's 
[03:34:30]  the one that canceled that day.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you sure it wasn't Jimmy?  Because Jimmy usually goes down that road too.  No, that was you.  That was like the one day.  And so you had to go down to the sidewalk?  No, down by the security desk.  And send him home?  Yeah.  Was he...  He grabbed me by my shirt.  He grabbed you physically?  Yeah, he grabbed me.  He said, are you fucking kidding?  I was like, the funny part is, no.  He goes, I miss...  I switched my flight.  I switched everything to come to the show.  I'm like, well, you could catch another later flight now. 
[03:35:00]  And he screamed, yelled, cursed.  But he couldn't come upstairs.  Yeah, he said, I'm going upstairs.  I go, I can't get you upstairs.  Oh, then he should have came in at that point.  Yeah.  Did you know that that was going on at all?  No.  No.  No, he screamed.  That's Roland's job.  He has to deal with all this because of him.  And he didn't even know what happened.  Well, my new friend, Kevin Pollack, is going to think I'm a complete asshole.  Quite the opposite.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You respect him.  Quite the opposite, yeah.  I mean, things happen, right?  Yeah.  Fuck yes.  Kevin knows.  It's a very awkward situation.  Things happen sometimes.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  And also, you had the memory of the guy saying, go fuck yourself on a very important day.  It was an extremely important day.  But you've never turned down somebody, like, at the door of the chat show before he was supposed  to go on?  Very early on, I said no to a giant, giant name in comedy.  Really?  Because for me, to sit down with someone and talk just to them for two hours live,  I need to be fascinated.  Right.  And I'm not fascinated by this guy's story.  Oh, who was it?  I really wanted to know.  Really?  Yeah.  On air?  You don't have to, on air.  I've never said who it was.  He's huge.  In comedy. 
[03:36:00]  But it's also kind of huge in a way that people go, oh, all right.  It makes sense.  Yeah, I think it wouldn't be much of a breaking story if I say the guy's name.  Everyone's got a name in their head now.  Yeah.  Well, good.  That's even better.  You know what?  A reason to tune in tomorrow.  Maybe I'll talk about it tomorrow.  We're going to name the name tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  Who else?  We had a guest that was sitting in the green room for almost an hour during the K-Rock portion,  and then Steve was instructed to tell her the show was over while we went and did the show at XM.  Who was the guest?  Nina Hartley.  She was promoting a book, and she sat in the green room for almost an hour, 
[03:36:30]  and we had to walk past her while she was in the green room to go do the XM show.  Or my favorite Steve moment is when you forget about Mike Rowe sat behind him.  What?  That's when I left.  Mike Rowe sat behind Steve for two and a half hours.  Where?  What do you mean sat behind him?  In the green room.  That was –  And then he said, Steve turned around and go, oh, you're here.  I've been here for two –  No, no, no, no.  What happened that day –  That's what he said.  I feel bad.  We gave him alcohol and everything, right? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, we got him a really expensive bottle.  We gave him alcohol and everything.  Well, no, we got him a really expensive bottle of what?  I think it was champagne or something.  No, I thought it was scotch.  Yeah, I think it was scotch, too.  I think it was some sort of hard liquor.  I think we found out what his drink of choice was.  Mike Rowe used to do our show all the time.  He's really good on the radio.  We like him a lot.  And we booked him the same day as Victoria Gotti.  Yes.  And she would not shut up.  And Mike Rowe ended up coming in here for like 15 minutes, and then you guys got Victoria.  No, we finally got him in, and then he was just sitting there because she kept talking. 
[03:37:30]  Right, because you thought Victoria Gotti was going to be quick.  And for whatever reason, we couldn't control the situation that day.  So Mike, you know, he's a guy that doesn't get mad.  He was mad.  He's coming back, though, soon.  But that was...  I believe that on Steve.  Really?  Yeah, I threw him under the bus.  Yeah, that was just one of those weird days.  It happens.  Yeah.  We didn't do that on purpose to him at all.  I know.  I blame Steve, though.  That's not in the host said no and blackballed for 10 years category. 
[03:38:00]  I want his badge of honor now.  Because, you know what?  He wasn't blackballed for 10 years.  That's his word.  His name came up a few times.  It's true.  It's only funny because they made a bigger deal out of it.  And by the way, the happy ending is an absolute thrill.  And I said this to you a year ago.  You did the show and went, holy fuck, I'm an idiot.  What's the matter with me?  All right.  I said it, right?  You remember.  But now it all makes sense because of that whole dramatic actor thing.  Yeah.  It's annoying.  Which we didn't do a lot of back then. 
[03:38:30]  Right?  We did mostly just comics then.  Now you do dramatic actors.  We do.  Yeah.  We take chances.  Who, by the way, your instinct was right, are not terribly interesting.  Yeah.  Or funny.  Rarely funny.  You're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  Sometimes it's like pulling teeth.  They're funny.  What?  You can't even say they're not funny?  That's not an insult.  There's somebody who's just not funny.  They're not funny.  Everyone's amazing.  Everybody can get on your own, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Funny.  He can't win.  If you're dealing with publicists every day, you can't fucking win.  No. 
[03:39:00]  No.  You know what?  What?  Everyone's bringing up Richard Jennings now.  Richard Jennings?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what happened?  I mean, bring everybody up to speed.  Not everybody knows.  Wait.  What happened?  I don't know.  Bring him up to speed.  No, I know that.  But before he died.  And I'm sure Kevin knew him probably.  Yeah.  Coming up.  But I think, Richard, if you were with us now, would be the first person to admit that  he was a bit of a pain in the ass.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  And I think you would admit that.  People who love him know that about him.  And he sort of was a pain in the ass at N.E.W. 
[03:39:30]  Uh-huh.  And he wanted on immediately.  And I don't remember what we were doing that day, but we just couldn't get him on immediately.  We still have a radio show we're trying to craft every fucking day.  Right.  And he was getting really impatient, so we decided to really just fuck with him and make him call  from outside the studio.  We allowed him to do a prison visit.  Well, because you had the big glass window, so he had to talk to you through the window.  And nothing against his comedy.  You know, funny guy, or we wouldn't have had him even at the station. 
[03:40:00]  He wouldn't have been booked if he wasn't brilliant.  Yeah, but he was being a pain in the ass.  I'm like, oh, really?  You're going to challenge me on that?  So then we forced him to, like, call from literally right out the window so we could  see him calling us.  And then we kind of had him sort of auditioning to come on the show.  If he came out, what bit would you do?  We did all that, which is great radio.  That's great radio.  But to this day, a lot of people feel that that might have been what made him do what  he did that day.  I don't think that.  I mean...  They like to make the fucking movie. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, that's a bit of a movie.  Of course, that's not the reason.  I'm sorry, this was the same day that he...  No, no, no.  No, then years later.  Years later, all that went down.  And people tie that together.  It started.  His downfall started that morning when you guys fucked with him.  Because our listeners are assholes.  Yes, they make that leap.  I wouldn't go with asshole.  I'm going to go idiot.  I'm going to go straight up moron.  But none of these guys were around for the...  None of them are around.  You guys weren't around for the prison visit.  No, I wish I was.  It was classic.  The one that really, I know, stung Roland hard was the David Tyree incident. 
[03:41:00]  The story that we've told a hundred times.  And that one incident made Roland a Jets fan because...  Really?  They wouldn't give him Giants tickets anymore.  No.  Well, David Tyree, the famous catch in the Super Bowl when they played the Pats last time.  You know, he caught it with the...  On his helmet.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he has a book called The Catch.  And we were in a bad mood that day.  We had a book.  He has a book called The Catch?  More than just a catch.  Thank you.  It was called More Than Just a Catch.  Right.  Like, no.  It wasn't just a catch to me.  It was everything.  It was about Jesus, too.  Jesus and all. 
[03:41:30]  And I forgot.  We were in a bad mood.  And I'm like, fuck this.  I'm not talking to this guy.  Who cares?  Good for you, by the way.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  But he won the Super Bowl for the Giants.  That should be big enough for you to want to talk to the guy.  Your sports team.  But it wasn't a guest pitch.  It was already been pitched, already approved.  The commercial break before he was coming on, they were, Opie and Anthony were looking  at the books going, well, what the fuck am I going to talk to him about?  I don't want to talk to him.  Right.  And then Rowling goes, he's, no, he's outside the door.  He's coming in now.  Right. 
[03:42:00]  So we walked, me and Ant walked right by him.  Sure.  He doesn't know what we look like.  No.  A lot of people don't because we do radio.  Right.  We walked right by him and had Sam and E-Rock make believe they were us.  Franchise.  That's great radio.  That's genius, actually.  It was the most uncomfortable interview.  We listened back to it a few weeks ago.  It was horrible.  And then I'm like, I'm like asking questions from the other room as like a listener trying  to fucking bury these guys in front of them.  Anthony pretended he was an intern at one point.  Yeah.  That's pretty true. 
[03:42:30]  And just David Tyree was sitting there.  Everyone loved that, but Rowling, I'm guessing.  Yeah.  I lost all my Giants tickets.  And David Tyree within three minutes knew something was up because first of all, Opie  and Anthony had this reputation and he looks at two guys that are in their 20s.  Right.  And then we're sitting there just trying to.  In all fairness to you, you were a lot greener.  Yeah.  I didn't know what I was doing on the air.  Sam has come a long way.  So he's just kind of starting out on this level anyway.  Right.  And E-Rock, we didn't really put on the radio a lot.  So now these guys are supposed to be these big radio stars, Opie and Anthony. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  And we're trying to shoehorn in bad Opie and Anthony impressions that the listeners will  get that are totally out of context.  Oh, my God.  Now they're playing our actual personality, too.  Yeah.  You know, the exaggerated version.  And this kid is talking about how Jesus helped him catch the bone.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  But, yeah, from that day forward, I guess that was Rowling's Giants hookup and they never  spoke to him again.  No.  They told me to lose the numbers.  Never asked for a takes ever again.  Again, this has got to be a badge of honor, though.  Right.  Now he's a Jets fan.  I'm a Jets fan. 
[03:43:30]  But see, like we said earlier, 20 hours of radio, you've got to fool around and do some  weird shit.  Yeah.  You've got to piss off someone.  Well, you know, usually it's deserved.  Well, sometimes.  Sometimes not.  Sometimes you just say no to people.  Like, I really want to do that show.  Why do they keep saying no?  Like who?  Kevin Pollack, for example.  No.  We got past that.  I thought we pulled that splinter out of his paw.  I think we got past that.  I forgot.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Yeah, I got to go.  You have to go? 
[03:44:00]  You know, we had a moment about that.  I like that.  It was a nice moment.  So who's doing the show tomorrow?  Me, Kevin?  Who else?  I think you might have summed it up.  What?  You got no guests coming in?  I'm going to call them again.  Holy fuck.  You're rethinking this right now, Kevin.  Get the kid who wrote the fucking book about Jesus and the football.  How early?  Now I got to be desperate.  How early can you get in here tomorrow?  We went from...  I went from not booking you to please help me.  I have the tables of time.  Holy shit.  You could really fucking turn this... 
[03:44:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  You could turn the screws, man.  If you want to get me back, don't show up tomorrow.  All right, well, just how great would that be if you'd know the show tomorrow?  You're going to see someone floundering.  Look, I know how to do radio, but I need to bounce off something.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  You could really fuck me in a while.  E-Rock will be here.  Exactly.  Oh, I could bounce off him.  That's for sure.  Or he could cuddle with you.  That cuddle story.  Well, I'll make you do radio tomorrow with me.  I'll come in early. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, come in.  I'll come in as early as I can.  You got a roll and show tonight, so...  No, sleep in a little.  It's not going to be here at 6.  Yeah, no, whenever you can, that would be great.  Oh, hell yeah, it's an honor.  And I know Mars, yeah, like Travis said, is willing to handle the first hour.  Yeah, he's wearing this Constitution t-shirt.  He's ready.  You're going to finish strong tomorrow, man.  Yeah, it's been a good week.  I have to finish strong, though.  Got to do it.  Because like you were saying, like...  I could talk basketball with Mars.  He's all about Lynn.  You could talk basketball, but can Mars talk basketball?  Yeah, Mars can't talk, so unfortunately...  Where is he?  Watch this.  Where's Mars? 
[03:45:30]  I don't know.  I think he might be taking siesta.  I can see what's available.  Really?  Yeah.  Wolf.  That's our booker.  Look at Kevin's face.  I can see him.  I'm desperate and you come up with Wolf Frazier.  Not a regular, just Wolf Frazier.  I could talk about his suits and some basketball.  That's it.  Right, so do the interview you did with him before.  950 to 10.  There you go.  No, I would talk to him again just because of the whole Lynn thing.  Here comes Mars.  We'll try him out.  Mars, you could talk Lynn's sanity, right? 
[03:46:00]  Absolutely.  Siesta, motherfucker?  I don't know.  Working my ass off.  I don't know what you're doing.  I don't see you.  I don't see you.  11 o'clock last night.  What happened?  What you talking about?  What went wrong?  Nothing went wrong.  I just fell in for somebody.  Oh, oh.  You're doing a double today?  He makes it sound like it was something for our channel.  I know.  I got a question for you.  What's our chances with the heat tonight?  That's all I need to know.  We're all thinking the same thing, right?  That's all I got to say.  Because LeBron.  Because our boys aren't together yet. 
[03:46:30]  They got to figure out this fucking puzzle.  Right.  And also.  I'm touching the kid.  Huh?  And LeBron and Dwayne, they play some amazing defense.  They're going to put it on them.  They're going to have a.  They're having a great year, too.  Yep.  Can I tell you?  What do you think of Novak from.  Amazing.  How cool is that?  Every basketball team needs a white boy like that.  I just.  I wonder why they don't put him in earlier.  I got to tell you something, Opie.  I got to tell you something.  What happened?  Somebody's very pissed at Mars.  Kevin's bored.  No, there was another school shooting.  Oh, shut up.  Cutting my attention.  Yeah, it's horrible. 
[03:47:00]  Somebody's pissed at Mars.  What?  Who?  Sal, the intern.  Why?  Sal, the intern, says that all of Mars' basketball information comes from Sal before you get here  in the morning.  Oh, really?  We bounce ideas off.  That's what Sal says.  Sal is a big fan.  He is.  He knows a lot about basketball.  He said he informs you.  And then you use it to talk to him.  Can I go rest up for tomorrow?  Yes, you may.  Wait a minute.  I'm stuck.  I didn't come in here saying that I know all this.  Of course, I'm going to go.  Caroline's tonight through Sunday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100. 
[03:47:30]  A whole bunch of us are going to go see Kevin Pollack.  See you tomorrow.  Maybe tonight.  See you tonight.  All right.  Good.  Just me and Mars, like, converse about basketball in the morning, usually.  And he's always reading the paper, getting his stats from me and all this sort of shit.  Oh, so he can talk to Opie when he comes in?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  You go to a lot of games, right?  Yeah, I went this past Wednesday.  I just found out I'm going to the Heat game in April a little while ago.  You got a rich father?  No.  Yes, he's rich.  Rich uncle that brings you?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me get in on that.  I don't have any Knicks connections these days. 
[03:48:00]  I'm getting in on his rich uncle.  Why not?  Because you're rich.  You don't need a rich uncle.  I don't feel like paying for tickets.  You are the rich uncle.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  You're the rich guy.  Oh, fuck.  You are the rich uncle.  How do you get tickets?  You just use your money and power.  Are there good tickets available?  They're like four grand.  He got it.  I ain't got no four grand.  If you want to pay for them, I ain't got no four grand.  You got it.  You just don't want to give it up.  If you want to pay for them, I get you to get tickets through the garden.  Yeah, it's StubHub.  It'll be face value.  Face value. 
[03:48:30]  Where are the seats?  Probably close to the court.  I want to be near Woody Allen.  Four grand.  Get me near Woody Allen.  I don't need to be near Spike Lee.  I just want to be near Woody Allen and his fucking fisherman hat.  On the white side?  I think they're 500 face value.  Near Woody Allen?  I think 500 or 1,000 face value.  Nice.  500 or 1,000.  It's either 500 or double that.  I'm pretty sure it's close to 5,000.  5,000?  Yes.  For the face value of those, yes.  Wait, you looked it up or you got it from Sal?  I looked it up, Sam.  Shut the fuck up, Sam. 
[03:49:00]  For courtside?  I bet Sal, Sam.  Yeah, courtside.  I didn't say that.  Eric, you sent it in my ear.  Where do you think I got it?  I made it up?  So what?  Wait, that's not StubHub shit?  That's face value?  No, face value for those of, like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can look it up right now.  I'm trying.  Fuck this Lynn guy.  Sal said he was pissed off.  No, I wasn't sort of pissed.  You know, you're just having this beautiful conversation with Opie in the morning about basketball.  Fucking Buzz, you said you were sleeping by that time.  So you're getting all your info from me.  See, Mars?  What the fuck's going on with these motherfuckers, man?  Are you getting your info from Sal when we're talking basketball? 
[03:49:30]  I do get information from Sal.  This isn't the first time Sal was mentioning it.  I was finally, Sam, I was finally opening up to the possibility of a new friendship.  Because I'm like, holy shit, he knows about the Knicks and what's going on here.  I do.  No, no.  But now I'm finding out you're getting your info from Sal, so I should become friends with Sal, not you.  That's exactly right.  All right, go be friends with that faggot.  Whoa.  Jeez.  Hold on.  I will admit, though, I really like chatting with Mars in the morning, though. 
[03:50:00]  It is fun.  Are you gay?  No.  Oh, no.  That's just because of what Mars said.  No, no.  But chatting with Mars is fun in the morning.  We talk basketball and stuff like that.  But it's just funny when he comes in.  Does he add anything to the conversation that you didn't know?  No.  He's like, who's that Indiana Pacer who used to kill the Knicks way back then?  Remember?  Fucking Reggie Miller.  I forgot his name.  You didn't know Reggie Miller's name?  Oh, my God.  I know who Reggie Miller is.  Wait a minute.  He's the Knicks killer.  For a second.  I forgot what Ferroga.  He looked like a fucking, what do you call that?  Those guys in this.  This is not. 
[03:50:30]  Star Wars?  Oh, but you see what's going on here.  I don't know.  Star Wars.  Your relationship is with Sal through Mars.  Yeah, me and Sal got to be friends.  Ferengi.  Ferengi, was it?  Was it Ferengi?  What's he talking about?  Me and Sal are officially friends.  Congratulations, Sal.  Congratulations, Sal.  Thanks, Alba.  I appreciate it.  That means you're not going to the next Knicks game, by the way, Sam.  I brought Sam.  He could care less.  Or is it couldn't care less?  Couldn't.  Couldn't?  Couldn't care less.  But when you use the other one, it's fine.  Everyone knows what you're talking about.  But when you're saying you could care less, technically it means, yeah.  Yeah, but everyone knows that means you don't give a fuck.  It doesn't make sense to me. 
[03:51:00]  Sal and I, we talk about basketball all the time.  I love chatting with Roland.  He's hysterical.  He's always like, yeah, you know, he passed the ball.  He played wing.  He brought it up on the after show.  Yeah, he said Lin's position was right wing.  Right wing.  Right wing.  And I think he finally got it, though.  He said, like, scoring point guard, which is pretty valid, actually.  So he eventually got it.  I like that Novak on the fucking perimeter, man.  Oh, my God.  Why don't they start him?  Who knows?  Because he plays, like, power forward and.  No, I know, but you have him hang out on the perimeter as fucking Lin is, you know, 
[03:51:30]  trying to, you know, go up the middle and drive and shit.  And then you fucking push it out to the fucking perimeter.  Mars is staring.  Not that good, man.  Mars is staring daggers at you.  Shumpert.  Whose phone's ringing?  Your phone.  Paul McCurrio.  Oh, that's the third guy.  That's him.  Why is Paul McCurrio?  Because he wants to come on the show now.  Are you going to take the call?  Paul.  Paul.  What's up, man?  I'm on the radio.  Holy fuck.  I didn't think you were still on the radio.  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[03:52:00]  I haven't talked to you in a while.  How much, man?  You guys in the middle of the show right now?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, all right.  How much, man?  I was just calling to see about coming back on.  I don't know if you guys are.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  It didn't work out well the last time, if you remember.  I'm not on the air, am I?  No, no, you're not on the air.  It depends what you define as air.  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk. 
[03:52:30]  No, I've got to get back to the show.  But we'll talk.  When do you want to come on?  Come on.  Well, I know it's super last minute.  I'm in town.  I'm actually thinking about coming by tomorrow.  You guys.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  Yeah.  God, we're so booked tomorrow.  We have so many people coming in tomorrow.  I think we have room.  We might have room?  No, no.  Booked up.  What do you got going on?  What do you got?  I'm working in Long Island at Governor's.  I'm headlining out there this weekend.  So I've got to plug that and, you know, kind of come on and reconnect, you know? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  You know, you guys are cool with it, you know?  All right.  What time tomorrow?  What's that?  What time do you want to come in?  I don't know.  What time?  I mean, what is your run?  I'm thinking maybe like 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock?  Is that good?  Yeah, that's cool.  All right.  Good.  All right.  I'll see you tomorrow and we'll reconnect.  You're not going to fucking put me in a barrel and hang me out the dryer or anything, 
[03:53:30]  are you?  No, I wouldn't do that.  You should know by now.  I don't hold a grudge.  We'll talk more tomorrow.  I've got to get back on the radio.  All right.  So what do you want to do?  I'll have Roland set it up for 10 o'clock tomorrow.  Sorry.  I don't know.  Where am I coming?  Up to Sirius 364?  Yeah.  Roland will call you.  I'll give him your number.  All right?  All right.  All right, brother.  Bye.  So the show. 
[03:54:00]  This now goes to the list of what you were talking about before, actually.  What happened?  He probably heard the radio.  Are you doing extra radio tomorrow?  No.  It's Friday.  It's Friday.  Get out of here early.  9.30?  All right.  I guess we have a guest then.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  We do for the shit show.  Can we franchise him?  Huh?  Where's Mars and Sal going?  We weren't done.  Well, Mars was just reading.  Mars needs some more Nix information.  Yeah, Mars, I saw as I took the phone call, you were trying to get some quick Nix info.  I went right to the sports page.  I can't read the fucking paper.  Don't you do that? 
[03:54:30]  No.  You went for like, holy fuck, maybe I can find a little tidbit.  Let me go.  Did you know the play at the...  Did everyone else see that?  Yes.  Of course.  Of course.  And what he was doing, he was researching, he was cramming at the last minute for when  the conversation starts.  They play at the garden.  Damn, it's remodeled.  Those seats you want, by the way, are four grand.  Told you.  I don't got four grand.  He didn't say four grand.  You said 500 to 1,000.  For what?  For the seats.  Woody Allen?  Mars is leaving as if he had a victory.  He just...  He's mad now.  Mars, I have to pretend he has work to do. 
[03:55:00]  He's mad because he got called out.  He's wearing a Constitution t-shirt.  Well, because...  I heard you the first time you said it.  Nobody can see his t-shirt.  Shut up.  The thing about...  Shut up, you're babbling fool.  The thing about Mars is that, like, this was his one thing, and you realize that the conversations  he was having with you were not real conversations.  He was researching right before the conversation.  Right.  Because he thought that was his end to be your friend.  Do you think he panics when Sal's, like, running late, and he knows that Opie's coming  in?  Yeah.  Can you imagine if Sal wasn't here one day?  What would Mars talk to you about?  No, and all honesty, I do enjoy talking with them because Mars has that sort of vernacular, 
[03:55:30]  I guess, the way, you know, he's talking.  Span English.  Span English.  Span English.  What do the Knicks have to do?  Now they've got to learn.  Focus.  I think, I think, I think, I was actually talking to my dad about that last night.  He was saying probably, I was thinking, like, a backup small forward.  Yeah.  Someone who's quick.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you for verifying that.  So, Mars, thanks, too.  Well, they've got some guys that can trade now.  They do.  Obviously.  They should cut Bibby.  They should cut...  Bibby is...  Yeah.  They dropped Ronaldo Balkman, who was their actual backup small forward, and he was pretty 
[03:56:00]  good.  Mars is in the engineering room writing down names furiously.  Bibby!  Bibby.  I love how J.R. Smith plays.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  He's a lunatic, though.  What's up with the hairdo?  He shaved it off.  I have no idea.  He had this, like, 90s rapper part, but it went across the top of his head.  It was really weird.  Yeah.  No, but I think Junior Smith is a good player.  I haven't seen a hair fucking style like that.  Yeah.  He's got a part going from, like, I guess it would technically be ear to ear. 
[03:56:30]  Or temple to temple.  It goes all the way across his whole head?  Yeah.  He shaved it off.  So, he's got a piece in front, then this weird part, and then the rest of his hair.  That's weird.  He played in China.  I didn't know that was going on in China.  He played in China, and it turns out, like, he left early, so he actually owes a million  dollars back to that team.  And they only signed him for 2.5 million on the mix.  Really?  Yeah.  But he used to play with Carmelo, too, which is good for chemistry and stuff like that.  Yep.  That's it, actually.  I think Jeremy Lin is being too polite to Carmelo. 
[03:57:00]  Just fucking keep playing how you're playing.  What the fuck?  And let fucking Anthony catch up.  Carmelo will find his groove.  You know, he's a little bit off right now, but just in due time.  And it's not like he needs to learn how to play basketball.  He'll just turn the switch on, and the Knicks will beat.  J.R. Smith looks like he had brain surgery.  That's what I'm saying.  It looks like it's a scar, yeah.  It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  But he's a head case.  He's gotten into, like, car accidents with Carmelo when they were in Denver and shit.  Like, he's a lunatic.  He looks like Jack Dingelson at the end of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with the lobotomy 
[03:57:30]  scars in his head.  He's tatted up all the way to his ears.  What's wrong with this guy?  He's tatted up all the way to his ears.  He's got, like, a Yankee symbol on his apple.  He's got a Yankee symbol on his neck?  Yeah.  He's a basketball player.  So he likes the Yankees.  He's a big Yankees fan.  Oh, is he rolling?  I might as well get that information from Mars.  You think he'd be embarrassed if the Yankees became a gay baseball team and you have the  logo on your neck?  I'm tired.  That didn't work.  Why would the Yankees become a gay baseball team?  That just didn't work.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not a, that's an M, not an N. 
[03:58:00]  That's a Young Money logo done in the Yankees font.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  It says Young Money over it, which the Young Money rap group is probably less of a franchise  right now in terms of longevity than the Yankees.  I think the Yankees probably would have been a wiser move.  You think he'll regret that?  See, have I got breaking news on the show?  What's the breaking news?  I'm going to put my headphones on.  It's just bigger than the big Ron and Fez announcement tomorrow?  A lot of big things happening.  Wow.  You just heard the first conversation I've had with Paul Mercurio in 10 years. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, and it wasn't good.  No, I saw him once open up for Brian Regan of Philly, but besides that, I haven't talked  to him since the big incident.  And now he might be coming in and do a little radio.  Yeah, with who?  Sam.  And now we got Tom from White Plains.  What?  Hey, Opie, Greg Hughes.  And is Kevin Pollack still there?  Yes, he's been quiet for the last 25 minutes.  Hi, Tom.  How are you?  This is Tom from Is Tom Alive Friday.  Incredible. 
[03:59:00]  Are you still alive?  Yeah.  I died the night I came home from the PCN Bank Center when I saw you guys, some traveling  virus.  I actually had a cardiac arrest when I was in the emergency room.  Wait, you died after our comedy show?  Yeah.  So how's the afterlife?  Well, I didn't see anything.  This guy died.  I didn't see anything.  So they brought me back pretty quickly. 
[03:59:30]  And I've been just taking it easy.  But I love you, Kevin.  I think you're great.  He's not actually here.  I don't mind.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kevin's here.  No, he's not.  Thank you.  Well, then why are you talking to him?  How's your health there, Tom?  How's your health?  Not good.  Not good.  You said that five, six years ago.  You're obviously fine.  Yeah.  I'm struggling around.  I huff and I puff going everywhere. 
[04:00:00]  Just a complainer.  Remember the moment when you set off that firearm live on our show?  What?  You don't remember the time you set off the firearm?  Yeah.  What?  Yes.  You called us saying you're going to kill yourself.  And then we talked you out of it, mostly Anthony.  And then the next thing you know, the fucking fire.  Was it Jimmy that day?  Yeah.  Where was I at with that whole thing?  Laughing?  No, you were being very concerned.  And then the firearm went off after the fact, after we talked you down. 
[04:00:30]  Yes.  And then an hour and a half later, I hear banging at my door.  And when I go to it, boy, there were eight cops.  Aiming weapons at me.  Yeah.  With the shields up.  And they took me to...  Bellevue?  Someplace like that, yes.  Here in Westchester.  Nice.  And I spent a couple of days in there. 
[04:01:00]  And I came down to see you.  Right.  You know, I've been listening to you, OB, since WBAB back in the...  Well, maybe you don't want me to tell you to say that, but, you know...  I think people can figure it out.  He knows he was at BAB.  Yeah, I was there in 92 to 95, I think.  And you did part-time before that.  I wasn't part-time at BAB.  No?  No.  Somebody wasn't listening very carefully.  No, no.  They were there and...  Were you a member of the Nighttime Attitude? 
[04:01:30]  I had shirts and everything.  You did?  Coming soon, I didn't do shit t-shirts, Sam.  Really?  Well, not really.  I still need someone to design it for me.  Just write it.  Huh?  Just write it.  No, I know what I want.  I need some fucking artists to fucking, you know...  Let's just get CokeLogic to do it.  That's what everybody else does around here.  Well, maybe we give CokeLogic a little break in the action.  What?  It's his business.  That's what he does.  He's very talented.  He's on everything.  Just do it in Microsoft Paint.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  I didn't do shit t-shirts a couple of times. 
[04:02:00]  All right, CokeLogic.  You heard.  I tried.  All right, Tom.  Anything else?  This is the big update, I guess, huh?  Yeah, I'm still around.  Good for you.  People ask me all the time.  And...  Not really.  Thanks.  Yeah, I don't think so.  But, thanks for the humor every day.  Yeah.  And, you know...  I wish I could thank you for something.  Thank you.  Well, I'm still waiting for my MacBook.  You never got your MacBook?  No, I never got it. 
[04:02:30]  God, this is so awkward.  You said if I come on stage in Philly, or Camden, you'd give me a MacBook.  Well, I went on stage.  And I thank you for that.  It was fun.  This is just uncomfortable, though.  No, it's weird.  I just returned a MacBook to Apple.  Because, for some reason, I got a new MacBook, even though my other one was less than a year old.  I'm like, I had so many MacBooks.  I'm like, I've got to return some of these.  I could have given one away.  Yeah.  I could use a MacBook.  So, you're getting confronted by all the guests that you've turned down, and all the people that you promised prizes to. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, what is this?  You guys set up an intervention.  Yeah, Opie, you've got to start being nicer to people.  How the fuck do I get called out on guests?  Paul McCurrio calls me live while we're still on the air.  And now, Tom from White Plains.  You guys set this shit up today.  Remember that lunch you were supposed to give us, like, five years ago?  No.  Yes, you do.  We all do.  That's for damn sure.  All right, Tom.  Hey, thanks, Opie.  I'm surprised you made it to the iPhone age.  I didn't think that was going to happen.  I'm surprised you made it to the Twitter age. 
[04:03:30]  I'm happy you're part of that.  Well, they told me I'd probably be dead within 10 years, and I died.  However, I was recovered, so now I got that over with.  I don't care if I dropped dead anywhere.  To hell with it.  Ronnie, this guy died.  There was nothing.  There was nothing before they brought him back.  But my theory is, why does there have to be something right away?  Maybe, you know, it takes a little time.  People have died all the time.  It's got to be some kind of fucking list.  I'm like, oh, I'll get to this guy. 
[04:04:00]  Plus, everybody's coming back.  And bring him to the afterlife.  Even if it's 100 years, it's still not so bad.  Just taking 100 years sleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It can't be that bad.  That's when it gets to the millions where it really freaks you out, right?  I don't know.  I'm not that afraid of before I was born.  You know?  Yeah.  So that doesn't scare me.  So after, you know, I'm not like, oh, I didn't exist during the 1920s.  So shit.  You're not worried about missing shit?  How do you know?  What would I miss?  No, this is my logic.  The apocalypse? 
[04:04:30]  If everyone dies, there it is.  Could it be that bad?  Yeah.  If everyone does, it could it be that bad?  Or is this a complete mind fuck and everyone has to feel this fucking horrible feeling that  they're going to be dead and nothing happens?  That's what it is.  I honestly just think that it just feels like you're falling backwards through space forever.  Whoa!  Whoa!  You just cut off from everything.  But after a while you would handle that and you wouldn't be scared of that anymore, right?  Unless you're feds.  Yeah, after that, then you'd be in a tight spot.  Then you'd be in a tight spot for a couple hundred years. 
[04:05:00]  Can't breathe.  Waiting to hit something?  Yes.  Oh my God.  Can you imagine?  Just bouncing off rocks.  You are fucking up people that are high right now.  Can you imagine?  You just fall for years and years and years.  Does it make any less sense than living on a cloud and playing the fucking flute or whatever  people believe?  No.  Of course not.  I don't know.  Blackness isn't so awful.  Is it just...  I feel like the scary thing is the world... 
[04:05:30]  I'm missing everything.  What would you miss?  What is this?  A fucking Super Bowl?  Sam, what's wrong with you?  You haven't figured out that this is all nothing?  It means nothing?  It's shit?  It means something in the moment, though.  What are you going to miss?  What are you missing?  What's one thing that you're going to miss?  Who cares?  Like, if people died in 2005, they weren't around to see Twitter.  I want to be around to see what comes next.  Wow.  Aren't you a little bit...  You want to live for Twitter.  Well, she's got big aspirations.  Do you really feel bad that you missed the Civil War? 
[04:06:00]  That you weren't there for that?  I guess I just feel like what's coming next is always better.  What's coming next is going to be the road.  That's what it's going to be.  It's you and your son in gray, fucking, ugly-ass streets trying to open up old cans of fucking peaches.  I hope that's...  I just want to know what it is.  You want to know my greatest fear?  Yes, I do.  It's very simple.  That I die, and within a mere, let's say, 10 years, they figured out how people live forever. 
[04:06:30]  And I was just...  I just fell fucking short.  How come you want to live forever?  That's what pisses me off.  Because that'd be kind of cool.  My main fear is to outlive my money.  That's the fucking fear.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  But, because, I mean, it looks like they're going to figure out some fucking longevity shit.  But what's the difference?  And is that going to start with, like, my son's generation?  Yes.  Or do I get a little taste of that?  Am I going to get a taste of that?  Oh, do you really want to be a fucking brain in a jar?  Just one of those fucking things? 
[04:07:00]  Maybe you're hooked up to some kind of a fucking robot legs.  Can you enjoy Thanksgiving?  I don't think so, man.  If your head's in a jar?  I don't enjoy it now.  I've got to spend it with my family.  Good point.  You know, Ryan and Fez's show is...  We've got to make some time for that.  He's already here.  I'm here.  It's all happening.  It started.  Fez is having moments with Kevin Pollack right now.  Oh, so he doesn't...  He's good.  Kevin Pollack has given Fez the advice show.  What Walken would say. 
[04:07:30]  Are you going to do Talkin' Walken with him?  Are you going to go sit on stage?  That was a real moment.  I don't know how I would fit in.  Because I just was staring at how great his Walken is.  And I'm like...  And Walken has a weird way of talking where he doesn't complete sentences.  You don't know when to jump in.  Do you think if Jay Moore found out that you were doing Walken with him, that Jay would  just be driving around the road crying?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you're going to ask him to come in and co-host your show tomorrow, but then you  won't do his show?  I don't...  But he really wanted you to do his show. 
[04:08:00]  I got the Oscars.  What do you mean you got the Oscars?  I was...  I was asked...  Nominated.  He likes to tweet during big events and then...  Live tweeting.  I was asked to do something.  I was flattered to be asked to do something for the Oscars.  So you can't...  I don't even know what the plug is yet, but I was asked to do so.  I have a conflict.  So Ronnie's going to do it.  Well, what time is Talkin' Walken?  I'm already out.  We're not doing Talkin' Walken.  He wants you to do it.  No, he decided we're going to do the chat show.  He's got two shows, Sam.  I want somebody to do this Talkin' Walken thing. 
[04:08:30]  I was going to tell him that he should get somebody to animate it like fucking Ricky Gervais  did, but I'm like, why am I helping him make 11?  He's made 66 movies.  66.  Wow.  That's a lot of movies.  No.  Tom, have you made a movie?  Yes.  And behind the scenes.  I worked on Sliver and the three Steven Seagal movies.  But Steven Seagal, he's cheap.  At least his production people are. 
[04:09:00]  Hold on.  I was on TV.  I'm just trying to find out how he's doing.  You know, Earl was our featured Black History Month today, and we didn't get to it.  Oh, God damn it.  No, we've got to get Fez in here and start the radio show.  He's fine, he's fine.  We'll save it for tomorrow.  We will?  Yeah, we'll honor Black History Month tomorrow.  Oh, Ronnie's a big fan of Earl.  I'm a big fan of Earl.  We all love Earl here.  That's my big mistake with Ronnie.  I got big mistakes with everybody.  What's your big mistake?  I'm trying to make good with everyone.  My mistake...  He's not doing talking, walking.  That's the mistake.  That's the mistake. 
[04:09:30]  Well, my big mistake with Ronnie was suggesting Earl.  You like Earl.  I do like Earl.  As a person.  But I suggested that Earl could be the guy for Ronnie.  And you don't think that's the case?  I don't know.  Don't we all miss Earl, though?  I mean, even though he was the worst.  He had a nice energy.  You haven't had one guy faint.  You haven't had one guy run down the subway.  Of course we miss Earl.  You never really got to work with Earl like we did?  No.  I mean, I listened as a fan.  It was just amazing.  But I didn't get to see him in the front.  You listened to the fan is what you listened to. 
[04:10:00]  What was he, the assistant fire marshal?  Assistant to the assistant.  Assistant to the assistant fire marshal for that particular floor at N.E.W.  and took his job very seriously.  Good.  As he should.  Yeah.  And the public file, let's not forget.  He did do the public file.  Oh.  Which is old school radio where you had to keep files.  What's that?  I should mention real quick that the Jim Norton's pre-sale is on sale now.  Oh, good.  It went on sale at 10 a.m.  tinyurl.com slash jncleveland is how you can get there. 
[04:10:30]  Regular is going to go on sale tomorrow.  But get your pre-sale tickets now.  Password is WMMS.  It's for his show at the Ohio Theater in Cleveland, Ohio, Saturday, April 28th.  He's taping a special.  So you can get your pre-order tickets now.  Are the Ohio players going to be with him?  Not sure.  I'd love to see that show.  Hey, are we done with-  You see who Van Halen's touring with?  Who?  Cooling the gang.  Is that true? 
[04:11:00]  Cooling the motherfucking gang.  Is it the real Cooling the gang?  Yeah.  Original members?  At least cool.  At least cool.  I can't speak for the gang.  You might have changed the gang?  Yeah.  It's got to be 100.  Tom, what's he still doing there?  Tom, please, shut up.  What are you doing?  This isn't death where you get to do whatever you want.  Yeah.  This is life.  We did the Make-A-Wish shit.  Stop.  Yeah.  We're talking here.  Really cool in the gang.  I didn't think I was on the air.  Tom, shut the fuck up.  It's not my show.  Well, you're the one with the mouth. 
[04:11:30]  I'm just fucking hanging, man.  You haven't moved out-  I have no pressure here.  You haven't moved out on a car.  I don't get credit for this shit.  Opie's fucking had his coat on-  For an hour.  Yeah, for an hour.  Do you realize that Paul Mercurio called me live on the show today?  There's a big get for Sam's show.  Opie goes, Paul Mercurio calls him, and Opie says,  Hey, I'm still doing the show.  I'm not on the air, am I?  No, not really.  Oh.  I said not really, though.  That should have been a hint.  And then he goes, I was thinking, can I come and do the show?  And Opie's like, yeah, sure. 
[04:12:00]  What were you thinking?  The listeners literally got to hear the first conversation I've had with Paul Mercurio  since it all went down, Ronnie.  Wow.  So Opie booked him for 10 o'clock tomorrow.  Perfect.  And Paul said something to the effect that you're not going to hang me out to dry or whatever he said.  Right, no.  And Opie said, no, I don't hold grudges.  What are you going to leave, five of?  Yeah, no, tomorrow I did an extra hour.  Now, I'm good to maybe 9.30 tomorrow.  Maybe.  Tomorrow you do a show until 10 o'clock. 
[04:12:30]  Because I don't know, you know, me and Kevin Pollack have to figure out our chemistry.  Ronnie might come in, hopefully.  Kevin coming in at six?  No.  No, he's not.  Oh.  He's got shows tonight.  You're coming in at six.  I'm going to come in at six if I can get out of here today.  Can you get out of here today?  I can get out of here a little early, yeah.  To fucking give Fez the stick.  Yeah, let Fez be in.  Fez is ready to fucking take the stick.  And the listeners love when he takes the stick.  And I know Pepper can handle it with Fez.  They have good chemistry.  The thing is.  Why do I get, I'm glad you're here. 
[04:13:00]  Why do I get what's called, you know, we all get Google alerts for our names?  Yeah.  I get Fez alerts from the listeners.  Do whatever he's doing?  I get Fez alerts on a regular basis.  Holy shit, you're right now.  Alerts.  There was one the other day.  But I assume it's just the same stuff that happens.  It is.  It is fucking Groundhog's Day.  And sometimes I think back to when I, it used to be like, holy shit, this is fucking.  That's why I love new Ron and Fez listeners.  Yeah.  Because I go, oh my God, he's having, he's having a breakdown. 
[04:13:30]  Yeah, give it a couple of weeks.  Well, what's really funny is when, and the weird thing is we always do get new listeners  here because people get cars.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's not like.  Right.  They finally can afford a car that might have this in it.  So whenever you get a new car, you're going to get this.  But they'll be like, what really fucking crushes Fez is best ofs.  Because people are like, holy shit.  I'm listening to the best of.  I'm laughing.  And I'm like, who's that fucking guy?  Then I find out it's Fez. 
[04:14:00]  And while they're doing it, he's just.  Nothing is a compliment to him.  No.  Nothing is a compliment.  He doesn't take that to mean, oh, I was doing something really special.  Most people don't get to do that.  But some of those best ofs are like, oh, fuck, I'm past that.  I'm replaying some horrible fight I might have had or something like that.  But are things okay with him and Zito?  No.  Not really.  So it'll go down.  Not good.  You know, the thing with Zito is. 
[04:14:30]  What the fuck?  Tom.  Tom.  Stop.  Tom, I just said the thing with him and Zito.  We weren't paying enough attention to you, I guess.  Tom.  What?  Why that big over the top?  I don't even know what you call that.  Was that a cough officially?  I suppose.  What was going on, Tom?  A little dust.  A little dust.  Sorry.  What's your lung capacity before we get back to the Zito thing?  60%.  That's all right. 
[04:15:00]  Down 40%.  Seems like plenty.  Almost passing.  I mean, don't walk up any stairs, obviously.  Right.  Yeah, as long as you don't.  Stay level.  Sea level.  Like live in Florida where there's no steps anywhere.  Right.  I imagine Denver's not a good idea for you.  Denver's a problem.  That would be a problem?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a problem.  What do you mean?  You lived in Denver, too?  No, I visited it.  All right.  Well, we're getting back to a Zito thing.  First of all, this guy needs a helmet for his lungs.  I don't know if anyone's ever invented such a thing, but I'd like to get one. 
[04:15:30]  Did you see that little baby with the fucking heart born on the outside of his chest the  other day?  It's fucking amazing.  Yeah.  And it makes it like a heart in his chest look like shit now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It just looks like stupid.  Wouldn't you keep the heart on the outside of the chest?  Your heart on?  Yeah.  It's kind of high, but yeah, I think I can get it up there.  I think I can get it up there.  Yeah.  I think you can as long as loose fitting clothes.  You definitely don't ever want to wear a vest. 
[04:16:00]  No.  I mean, the odds are you're just going to have a regular life, but if you've got a heart on  the outside of your chest to begin with, why wouldn't you just go with that?  Tank tops are out of the question, too.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to do that.  No, you put like a fish tank, like a fucking goldfish, like a orb over it just to protect  it when you leave the house.  I've seen pictures of Jesus with his heart on the outside of his chest.  Oh, yeah.  Well, illustrations, I guess.  I don't think they're actually pictures.  They didn't have photographs back then.  That's still accurate.  It was a good illustration, though. 
[04:16:30]  It was.  So Zito and Fez, are they okay?  No.  Oh, you didn't hear.  The thing is, some of you guys, and by the way, this thing that you're even asking about  Fez is why that just kills him.  Did I ask?  That you were asking about him.  He's listening somewhere right now.  He can come in.  He knows he can come in, right?  He doesn't feel comfortable around you.  Why?  Fez and me talk wrestling all the time.  He doesn't trust you on the air.  Yeah, you're brave when he's not here, is what we're saying. 
[04:17:00]  Say it to his face.  Say what to his face?  All that stuff you were just saying, whatever it was.  I would gladly.  Why don't you just be cool with him?  I'm trying to.  I didn't realize there was any problem.  No, there isn't.  But you're saying, like, why does he come in, and that's making him feel bad?  Because you said he was feeling bad that we were talking about him, and he wasn't here.  No, but the fact that that's what you're going to know.  What about Fez?  Because when you do that, it makes him feel bad.  Well, I don't want Fez to feel bad.  I just thought if he was going to do the show by himself, I would see how he was doing,  Chris.  Is he just even bringing that up? 
[04:17:30]  And you know you're making him more and more nervous.  He shouldn't be nervous.  He's putting pressure on him.  He's taking the stick, so Ronnie can go home, so Ronnie can do the show tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to that.  Who's all coming in tomorrow?  Everyone's bailing.  It's not a long list.  A lot of the guys are in L.A. doing their thing.  Jimmy's out.  Ant's out.  Kevin Pollack might show up later.  Yeah.  Jim Jeffries, I thought, was doing the show, but he's not.  And Paul Mercurio might now come in.  At 10.  At 10.  But I might have to move him down. 
[04:18:00]  You would really do the Mercurio show?  Yeah, I'm over it.  I hope nobody shows up and it's just you and Paul Mercurio having that awkward conversation.  That'd be cool.  I think it'd be great radio.  I love awkward.  I know you do.  I want to set up an O and Fez show.  I want to do an O and Fez show.  Do you remember what happened last time you came in with him?  I do.  You're not over it?  Well, we definitely will make sure the Stangles don't call in this time. 
[04:18:30]  Well, they were the catalyst.  Yeah.  Fez would admit that.  But me and Fez are back to small talk in the hallway, so we're good.  Oh, good.  Good.  Small talk.  Talk about the beard a little bit.  Yesterday we talked about a mast.  Great.  Well, you're talking about bearded, unmasked people.  I mean, what did you say?  Who's the best beard that's ever done the show?  I asked him yesterday.  He's like, we're doing a mast.  And then he said who it was.  And I didn't really know the guy.  Yeah.  I go, I don't really know much about him.  And then Fez just kind of stared at me and I went.  I stared at him. 
[04:19:00]  Well, you know what?  He probably didn't know the guy either.  And then we kind of had to just walk away awkwardly.  But it was small talk.  That's good.  It's the same.  Now, you know Pollock, Norm.  Yeah.  Would I know this guy if I saw his picture?  No.  You don't, do you watch Party Down?  No.  You ever watch The State?  No.  Oh, let's see.  That's it.  That's all you know him by.  That's his big stuff.  Tom, can we say goodbye to you?  Sure.  We're in Ron and Fez time now.  Yeah.  Hey, Ronnie. 
[04:19:30]  Have a good show.  Hey, thanks, buddy.  I'm glad you're still alive, Tom.  You too.  Really glad.  Thank you.  Hey, take care of that lung.  Thanks, Ron.  Okay.  60 percent.  That's good.  Yeah, it's 50 in one and 10 in the other.  Yeah, that's out.  Ugh.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Creepy girl laugh.  Well.  All right.  All right, Tom.  Take care, guys.  Thanks.  Call us sometime, all right?  I will.  All right.  Sometime.  When are you doing your show today, Sam? 
[04:20:00]  That was it.  No, I did this.  You did it for me.  So what happens?  We dock your pay?  Come in after me and Fez.  I'll do it.  That'd be great.  Ron and Fez.  Why don't you do a little time with Fez so Ronnie can go home nice?  I would love to do time with Fez.  No, I'm serious.  That's happening.  I would do it in a heartbeat.  Well, it's Ronnie's fucking decision.  I mean, Fez could make the call, too.  True.  All right.  Stay tuned.  Whatever's going on with Ronnie and Fez is coming up next.  Big announcement tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. 
[04:20:30]  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey. </pre>
