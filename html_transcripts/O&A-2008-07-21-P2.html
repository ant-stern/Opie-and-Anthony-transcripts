<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a sexually explicit voicemail.  Following this, musician Jed performed his song, "Shine On."  The main event was a bizarre "Super Bowl" contest centered around testicle-based challenges.  A "creepy bug guy," Ken from New Jersey, a supplier of feeder insects to pet stores, brought various insects including hissing cockroaches, mealworms, superworms, and honeybees.  He discussed his insect-collecting experiences and demonstrated the insects. Another guest arrived with paper wasps collected from a telephone pole.  The planned stunt involved using these insects, along with mousetraps, wax strips, and Bengay, on the contestants' testicles.  Multiple callers offered sexually suggestive comments and suggestions.  EMTs were on-site due to the potentially hazardous nature of the event.  The hosts and guests discussed logistics, safety precautions, waiver forms, and previous stunts involving EMT assistance, including a 55-gallon drum challenge and a cockroach-in-the-ear incident.  Mention was made of a previous failed attempt at a similar stunt and the potential prizes.  Tracy Morgan was a guest participant.

The "Super Bowl of Ball Bag Abuse" began with the hosts putting on beekeeper suits and joking about their impracticality.  Specialized rat traps ("rat snaps") were also discussed. Contestants subjected their testicles to mousetraps, waxing, Bengay, and bees contained within a custom-made device.  The bee transfer process was chaotic.  Legal and safety concerns were frequently addressed, and waiver forms were reviewed and signed.  The show's producers and lawyers restricted some proposed devices.  Raphael from Connecticut endured three mousetraps, setting an initial high bar.  The segment was frequently interrupted by XM radio advertisements.  The hosts and guests used significant profanity and crude humor.  Steve from Connecticut later surpassed Raphael's record with five mousetraps (though one fell off). Matt from New York City managed three despite a hand injury.

The "Super Bowl Thursday" competition continued with wax strip application and removal. Tracy Morgan left during this portion. Ari from *The Sopranos* and *Dog Sees God* joined as a guest. The final challenge involved placing the scrotum in a container of bees.  Raphael and Steve from Connecticut participated, both suffering stings. Matt also attempted the bee challenge, while Fez from Ron and Fez made a surprise appearance.  The segment was chaotic and filled with graphic language and depictions of pain.

A significant portion of the show focused on Anthony's behavior during a recent interview with Shawnee Smith from *Saw III*.  The hosts analyzed Anthony's apparent nervousness and attraction to Smith, replaying segments of the interview and highlighting his awkward phrasing, body language, and high-pitched voice. They teased Anthony relentlessly, mimicking his actions and creating the nickname "Shawnee Ant."  Callers joined in the ribbing.  The hosts speculated about the interview's appearance on camera.

Further discussion of Anthony's infatuation with Shawnee Smith included replays of interview audio clips, highlighting perceived awkwardness and what the hosts interpreted as "smitten" behavior.  Opie and Bill Burr frequently interjected.  The hosts teased Anthony, using terms like "Nancy," "chipmunk," and "psycho."  They analyzed pictures from the interview. Guests, including "TJ the Trucker" and sex advice-giver Sue Johansson, briefly contributed.  The discussion also touched on other celebrities like Ozzy Osbourne, Jim Norton, Mickey Rourke, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Daniel Radcliffe's upcoming nude scene. Shawnee Smith herself later called in, confirming some of the hosts' observations. The show concluded with more jokes at Anthony's expense and the usual closing remarks.

[00:06:30]  Because we got EMTs pacing back and forth  Outside the studio  With all sorts of paperwork  And things  Based on this program  They should be here every day  Every day  Right  Every day  Then there's an ambulance  Right downstairs  Right downstairs  Waiting just in case  Someone has an allergic reaction today  Yeah  We have this creepy bug guy  That came by  I don't know how he has  So many creepy bugs  I'll tell you why he's creepy bug guy  Because he has a lot of really creepy bugs 
[00:07:00]  That I've never seen in my life  Yeah  He decided to just bring in an array of bugs  Here he is  Big collection  This is the guy that is saving Super Bowl  Yes  So he can do the ultimate challenge  What's your name, bro?  Ken  Hey, Ken  Nice to have you here today  Nice to meet you guys  Well, you want to bring some of your bugs in?  Sure  We can have a little show and tell  Yeah  Where are you from?  New Jersey  Why did I know that before you said it?  Creepy bug guy has to be from New Jersey  And we can collect this stuff from most of the buildings in New Jersey 
[00:07:30]  I don't doubt that  Yuck  Wait, like, this is your job to  What is your job?  Yeah, what's your job that you have these bugs?  We sell feeder insects nationwide to pet stores  Oh, okay, sure  Bait shops, that kind of thing  So the mealworms over there would be for your reptile, your lizards, things like that  For lizards, the bigger ones, the bigger, larger mealworms are for bait  And what about the cockroaches?  Why would people need these?  I see them all the time on this show 
[00:08:00]  For some reason, they're a staple of this program  What would people need one of those for, aside from a radio show?  Just to feed reptiles  Sometimes they keep them as pets  Are those the hissing cockroaches?  Yeah, I have some hissers there  If you touch them, they hiss  Matagascar  You got to hear these things  You know what?  I'm proud to say we introduced the world to the hissing cockroach  Oh, yes  Way before  National Geographic  Way before Fear Factor  Yeah, true  We were doing  55-gallon drum  Yeah, we were doing things with the hissing cockroaches many, many years ago 
[00:08:30]  You got to bring one of those to the mic because this is the creepiest sound  And they're  Listen to this  Ah, E-Rock's running  Well, listen to what this thing will do when you touch it  Oh, God  Right now it's burrowing into my hand, too  I see that  That hissing noise  Can you find those in New York?  Yeah 
[00:09:00]  No, I'm serious  Can you find those in buildings?  Like, I see  No, no  In my apartment, I see a cockroach every once in a while  But I'll never see a hissing cockroach  Aren't they from Madagascar?  Yeah, these are actually from Madagascar  They're just indigenous to tropical regions  Yeah  We're not allowed to sell these in Florida because they can live down there  If these were to get loose here  They'd only be able to live during the summer  And they'd die as soon as the temperature went down  Right  Like the homeless  Yeah  The homeless in France  Yeah  Oh, but somewhere in Florida you let those go 
[00:09:30]  And uh-oh, could be a problem  Yeah  Two of them get together, hook up  Well, we got to have a little sex  The males have bumps on their heads  And the females don't  So that's how you can tell them apart  Well, that's how you can tell  And the males hiss, the females don't  Yeah  Wow, they're kind of opposite of humans  Exactly  Where the male keeps quiet and the woman is just, you know  Yap, yap, yap  Yeah  Hiss, hiss, hiss  And if she does, she usually ends up with bumps on her head  Well, I got the list of insects in front of me here  The hissing roaches 
[00:10:00]  Maggots  Maggots  Superworm beetles  Yeah  What's that?  These are the superworm beetles  If you touch them, they'll release a pheromone  Which is an attractant, like a sexual attractant  Which is something that females also do  Are females  Yeah  But they have, they also secrete a brown liquid that'll stain your hands  But they stink  So does Jimmy Norton  Coincidentally enough  When he's out on dates  Is that right?  Yeah  This, these, they smell too 
[00:10:30]  But these will also do like a little tickle, nibble kind of thing  Not that I've tried it  But if you, if you were to, you know, place your stuff in there  You would  Your bag on top of that  You'd get a sensation  Now, none of these are poisonous  Except maybe the honeybees  If you're allergic  The bees  The bee venom  And there they are  Yeah  The bees  Now, I saw your contraption, which is very phallic 
[00:11:00]  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  Once these, once they place their, their bag, I guess, in that contraption  Yeah  That appendage that sticks out  Yeah  Should be blown into  The reason for that is that it'll, the warm air will get these guys angry  Oh, so someone has to blow into the phallic  Phallic appendage  Yes, to the tip of that  As, as some guy's sack is hanging in the Tupperware portion  You know, I've been fighting this for so long, I give up 
[00:11:30]  This show is gay  What a gay show we're on  This is a gay show  So you're telling me, as the expert, that someone has to blow into the tube  To get these bees going  Someone does, and I'm, I'm not expert enough to do that myself  No  What is it about human breath that riles up the bees?  I don't know if it's the, just the heat and the moisture or the, something, you know,  Instinctive in them that just sets them off  Iraq can't do it  Because it will be a bee holocaust  It'll be like the showers at Dachau 
[00:12:00]  Now, if they're, I, I got stung by, by these bees  I got stung about ten times just collecting them  This is how, wait, you got stung ten times yesterday  This is how dedicated this guy is to the show  I love this show  He's the one that stepped up and said, alright, I'll get the bees for the guys  Look at his hand, it's all swollen  I have my hand, my arms  He got stung ten times, he's allergic to bees  And this is not fat, it's a swollen bee venom in my  Are you kidding?  No, yeah, I'm kidding, I'm fat  What, uh  I know, I'm like, wow, that stuff must collect in the liver 
[00:12:30]  What, uh, oof, what do you do to collect them?  I just, I just went in and I just stuck a stick in, got them angry when they came out  I brushed them into cups and they just went all over me and started stinging, so  You got, what, one of those big box type hive things?  I have hives, yeah, the hives you were talking about  Yeah, I'm one of those guys  How many?  Uh, I have three hives  And what is it for, just honey or?  Just to pollinate, yeah, and for honey, make wine out of the honey, mead  Really?  Mead, ah, yes, yes  Yeah, it's a good old fashioned way to get drunk  From mead days of old 
[00:13:00]  How many times do you get stung a year, having bees?  No, just a couple, but last, last, last summer I had some go up in my shorts  Which is how I know these will work, and I got stung  And I, I have, uh, my daughters were out there, and they're little  And they just saw the bees going up, they saw me fall over on the ground screaming  And, uh, they were laughing  That's gotta horrify the children  Oh, they were laughing?  They were laughing at me while I  That's great, kids, Jesus Christ  Yeah, I thought, I thought that that was done, I was at, no more kids  All right, hold on, Ben's raw, uh, Ben's raw ass has something  Ben's raw ass, what's up? 
[00:13:30]  Hey, I wanna know if this dude brought his, uh, cock-licking ball roaches  What, what's, what's, what's that?  Cock-licking ball roaches  That's from what I said  Are you doing a callback of his awful, uh, line yesterday?  Yeah, I'm the awful calling guy  Yeah, all right, very good  Ben's raw ass, everyone  All right, uh, what else is there?  Anything of interest?  Um, just, these are just regular German roaches  We have, we also have some flightless fruit flies  We, we've bred these so that they wouldn't have wings 
[00:14:00]  So if you look at them, they kind of look like ants  But they're actually fruit flies  Okay  And what the hell can they possibly do?  They just, they just exist and people feed them to frogs  Oh, yeah?  That kind of thing, yeah, yeah  What do you sell these to, pet shops?  Pet shops, bait stores, and then regular, just reptile enthusiasts  Now, obviously, you brought a lot of this stuff in just for show  But can we use anything else there on the table except for the bees?  Yeah, yeah, I think, like, these are super worms  You know, these are the other things that you see them eating on, uh,  Like, fear factor and that kind of thing 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah  So, they, and they stink  They'll also nibble and stuff, but they're getting a little, uh, lethargic here  A little tired  Is it the cold?  Yeah  Oh, and just so you guys know, too  When you're ready for mosquitoes, let me know  Just give me a week's notice and I can hatch you out a bunch of mosquitoes  See, we wanted, uh, we thought about that way too late  We wanted to do the mosquitoes as well  Yeah, because, uh, mosquito bites on your bag  I've never, I would say  Thank God I've never been bitten on the bag  I would say the mosquito, uh, bite on the bag would be worse than getting stung by a bee 
[00:15:00]  On the bag  Uh, maybe the instant pain  Yeah, the bee more terrifying  Knowing it's happening  Yeah  But a mosquito doing it, you know, after, after he's done  I think it would be much more of a problem  And the, the quick pain from the bee sting  But then you have that residual, itching, big bump on your nut  Kind of thing you gotta deal with  You gotta do the whole thing  You do the thumb and forefinger  Only a guy could know about the thumb and forefinger roll of the bag  It's, you sit there like a dog scratching himself 
[00:15:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  It is wonderful  It's the other ecstasy  That's the other ecstasy  Oh, alright  The other ecstasy  Sorry  And we have wax worms  Yeah  Wax worms  Yeah, you brought a lot of tame insects, a guy told you  Yeah, these are, these are pretty, pretty tame  These, these are, if you look at these, these are real maggots  Regular housefly  Yeah  Bully bodies and stuff like that  Oh, yeah  Which is always good for, you know, getting from Jersey  Wow 
[00:16:00]  I've never seen maggots before  Alright  She doesn't seem to like the maggots  Very nice  Okay  Alright  Well, we gotta thank you for bringing the bees in  Yes  And getting stung doing it  Look at his right hand  I know  It's all swollen  It's all swollen  You were taking Benadryl all night long?  Yeah  Yeah, but it doesn't do what it does for most people, you know  Right  You need the epi shot, right?  Yeah  Why'd you get stung?  They didn't like being taken out of the hive at night 
[00:16:30]  Oh, are they sleeping?  Yeah  Yeah, he's got one of those hives  Pissed off bees  Yes  And you woke them and they were like all biting you?  They bit me all over  Oh, they were pissed off  But we got a whole container  There's gotta be, what, 30, 40 in there?  Yeah, and I brought some backups just in case  So what will you do with these when you don't?  I guess, I don't know if I'm gonna even want to touch them after they've been, you know  Yeah, that's true  Probably just open up the container near the hive and see what happens  They call them faggot bees after that  See if they come back 
[00:17:00]  Boy, but those honeybees are nothing compared to the wasps I saw on that video last night  Did you watch that?  I didn't see it  Oh, it was a good one  God, it is unbelievable  These killer wasps  The hornets, Japanese hornets  The hornets, yeah  There were 30 of them that took out 30,000 honeybees  Took out a whole colony  30 of these huge wasps come flying in  One of them comes in  Marks it  Like he goes out on a little scouting mission  Marks the hive  This is a video that shows the whole process 
[00:17:30]  I said the clip of the Japanese hornets I told you about  Yeah, yeah  The Japanese hornets  And it's filmed very well  I mean, they get these up-close views of everything  They get inside the nooks and crannies in the hive and everything  And the hornet flies back to his crew  And goes, hey, I found some honeybees  I marked it with some theramon or whatever the hell they call it  Yeah  And then they take off  And they get to the honeybee hive  And just with these huge jaws  Start biting these bees in half 
[00:18:00]  They were just  And you're watching bee heads falling  And bodies just kind of shaking around  They went through the entire colony in what?  Three hours  Three hours  It took 30 of these wasps to kill 30,000 honeybees  And they couldn't gang up on the wasps?  Were they trying?  They were trying  A couple  They killed like a couple of them  With the stingers that they have  But they're just no match  But then at the end  They showed this honeybee colony  That has a system  The wasp comes in 
[00:18:30]  And yeah  This hornet comes in  To the tracking hornet  The initial just one  And as he's laying down his theramones  The honeybees gather around him  And start shaking  And from their shaking  They work up so much friction  That it gets up to 120 degrees  And the bees can take 120 degrees  The hornet can't  How the hell do they figure that out?  They cook the hornet alive  And he never gets to go back  And tell his crew where they are 
[00:19:00]  And they just figure this out  Yeah  You gotta love nature  Yeah  They did this little weird  Abdominal shift thing  The hornet flies in  All these honeybees are sitting there  Kind of moving  And then all of a sudden  Every one of them goes  Broom  Quarter turn to the left  And that told all of them  To jump on this hornet  And start shaking  Like where does that come from?  It's the way you feel as a white guy  When you walk into a black club  You just feel like everybody  Is doing some kind of a signal  And they're going to attack you  At any second  You walk into the wrong bar  And you feel like everybody  Is just kind of like looking at you 
[00:19:30]  And signaling each other  That is crazy  Yeah  Alright  Well we're going to get to you  And your honeybees  In a little while bro  Thank you so much  For helping out the show  Thank you  We just didn't think  We were going to pull off  The old bee trick today  No  Those holes are too small  Too big I mean  They're covered up  With some kind of  Yeah  Some kind of breathing  Membrane  I wouldn't even touch that though  Because I'd be afraid  One of them would poke their  Stinger up through that  Yeah I had them in a plastic bag  Originally and they were stinging me  Even through the plastic bag  Oh  Yeah he just got stung like crazy 
[00:20:00]  Now here's the  Where's the contraption  Let's bring the contraption in again  Is this  Are we going with the contraption  Yeah because intern Bill  Modified the thing  Oh intern Bill did  Yeah bring intern Bill in  Is it true that you tried to collect  Intern Bill as a new insect  Here's Bill  Here's the phallic apparatus  That the boys will be using today  Got two of them  And we just learned that  Someone's going to have to  Blow into the tube  Right  To get the honeybees riled up  Riled up 
[00:20:30]  Because they don't like human breath  Bill are you willing to  Blow into the tube  Blow into it  Yeah  While it's attached to the guy  But the guy's got to  Put his sack in there  And then you have to blow it  Well you don't have to get  More than a foot away  From his bag  Because you got to  Blow in the front of that tube  You got to blow into  The front of the phallic tube  Yeah  There's got to be  Better ways than that  How about if  Maybe he can just  Blow on his balls  And then put the thing  On real fast after  So the breath's on  Now how did you modify it  Well instead of just using 
[00:21:00]  Whatever we originally had  I put gloves  Latex gloves  And stretch them out  Across the hole  Which the balls  Are going to go in  And the balls  Will fit through comfortably  Comfortably enough  That the bees won't get out  And the bees won't  Be able to get out  No  As long as they don't  Rip them out  While the bees  Stinging them  And pulls them out  Within moderation  This should work  Very well  With basic odds  What are the odds  We got to remove  Some of that tape  Around that  So we can watch the bees 
[00:21:30]  Yeah we got to be able  To watch it  So cut it away  Maybe cut it away  Slightly  Trying to razor it off  Yeah we got to be able  To see that  The backs  I'm trying to keep  Open as the windows  Mostly  Well also  We see the back  Of his balls  That's wonderful  No see  But  Well the problem is  This is the only part  You're not going to be able  To see  Because this is going to be  Up against their body  His taint  Yeah  Yeah we need to clear that open  How do you think they're going to do it  Like this  Well they might be able to do it  Or you could do it sideways  Because they're just dropping it in  Right  It can really go anyway  I guess you're right  It doesn't have to stick out 
[00:22:00]  Like a big penis  I would just make more room  So we can see from other angles  I guess  Odds wise  What are the odds  As you're loading the bees in here  That some bees will escape  Into this  He's not an expert at this  We're fucked  Yeah I've never  I've never done this  This is close to 100 bees  The more I look at this container  Yeah  I don't know how  And we need to get just a few  In these tubes  I don't know how we're going to transfer  How would you load bees into that  I think we're going to get a plastic tube  And we're going to try to transfer them that way  This way they'll go through 
[00:22:30]  The tube into that thing  And then we'll close it off  Sure they will  The neat thing is going to be that  When honeybees sting  They die afterward  Because they lose their stinger  Yeah  So their stinger will actually  Be stuck in their balls  And they'll just keep pumping away  In the sack  Secreting that poison  Is that what it does?  Yeah  And so if you don't let them  Pull that stinger out  It'll just make everything  Just a little worse  Oh god  Wasps can sting multiple times  So  Yeah  Are they going to go after the bees  In these things?  Wait we have wasps?  Yeah some guy showed me a wasp 
[00:23:00]  At some point  Where?  We have more bees out there?  I don't know  I don't know where he went  He just had a wasp and a gerber job  Oh  Oh yeah  Oh bring him in  Who has wasps?  Who's this guy?  I don't know  He's got some goodies too though  Hey bro what's up man?  How's it going?  Get on that mic there  You brought a wasp in?  I got a bunch of wasps  How do you get these?  We work for the phone company  Yeah  They sting the shit out of us  All the time  I bet 
[00:23:30]  Holy crap  Got two singles  And two jars with four  How do you get them?  Mike dug them out of a pedestal yesterday  Oh these are yellow jackets no?  No they're paper wasps  Oh that wasp is nasty  And then if we heat this up  Those guys will be dancing around  Like your bee sound effects  Oh god  Is that a whole nest in there?  Yeah pretty much  Holy crap  Wait what do you do?  When you're up on the pole  You're going to grab something  And they just fucking attack you? 
[00:24:00]  You pop a terminal open  And right in your face  Oh wow  And you look like a lunatic  Waving your hard hat in the air  I got the spray with me  That we kill them with  Just in case  Why don't you spray it before you open it?  Sometimes we do  If you see an opening  You squirt it in the sides  But  How many times have you gotten stung on the job?  I got it about  Over over half a dozen  Yeah  Notable being on the flat part of my ear  I used to get that with  Attic jobs  When we do jobs in the attic  And  I would just leave  I'd be like  Hey there's bees here 
[00:24:30]  I'm not doing the job  Fuck it  They were all like clustered  It was just so  God damn frightening  But with this  With these  All you got to do is  Open a jar  And press it against his nuts  And rattle it up a little bit  If we heat that up  Yeah  Like last night  When we were in the office  Breaking them up  They were  Crawling and  Very active  But overnight  Pissed off  Yeah  It gets a little colder  Right  Oh I got the heebie-jeebies  Officially  Yeah  That little nest there  Who is this? 
[00:25:00]  The ooper?  Youper  The youper  What's up?  Hey  I love the show guys  I just wanted to say  When you get  One of your boys  To blow on the tube  Make sure it's not  E-Rockers  Bad Beth  They'll kill a bee  Well  The joke was made earlier  Sir  All right  I have noticed  You went  Bad Beth  Yeah  I've noticed  On Pal Talk  The girls  Showing up a lot  Earlier today  On the Pal Talk 
[00:25:30]  Cams  Anytime guys  Testicles  Are going to be  Exposed here  On the program  The ladies  Figure it's their day  Well who's going to be  The expert here  On balls or bees  On bees  I'll determine  If someone's stung  My method is very simple  If they scream  And drop a jar  We have to  We have to check  Well how are we going to get  These bees  Into the contraption  Well they're pretty slow  Right now  I could probably  Wrangle  Pretty slow right now  I could probably  Wrangle a couple in there  Can we do this outside  Yeah this will be done 
[00:26:00]  Outside of the studio  No I mean outside  Oh you mean outside  Outside  It'd be better  Because they'd stay cold  As long as they're cold  They're going to move around  Like that  Let me bring them in  And heat them up  Don't drop those  And they're going to get nuts  I got  I got no problem  Callously  Yes  Carelessly  No callous  Yeah  Wouldn't callously be  If he was like  Throwing them around  And spitting on them  Yes that was kind of  Why I was saying  That the way he was  Handling them  To me was callous  Alright  Also with 
[00:26:30]  Wasps  I believe  Your creep bee guy  Could confirm this  But they don't lose  Their stinger like bees  No  They're just going to  Keep jabbing  And jabbing  And jabbing  Yeah  They're a tough guy  And these guys  Aren't allergic to bees  The super ball guys  What they say  How did you get that nest  They're willing to sign  You just dug it out  Well yeah  Knocked it right out  Out of the tunnel  Into a jar  Actually into a  Water bottle  He squeezed all that  Through the neck  Of a water bottle  And last night  I cut the water bottle  Open and started  To break them up 
[00:27:00]  Into individual jars  Whoa  Ballsy move  Ballsy move  My friend  So alright  Game on  We have plenty of bees  We have wasps  We have stuff  That looks like  Yellow jackets  But they're not  You're saying  They're paper wasps  To let Steve know  Exactly what they were  Okay  Paper wasps  I have no problem  With them loading  That outside  Yeah  Just so there's  A complete barrier  Between us here  In the studio  And loose bees  Well there's a lot  Of bees  That's the problem  I can understand  If we try to transfer  One or two  And it gets loose  Whatever  But there's like 
[00:27:30]  I mean that jar  Is close to a hundred  No I don't even want  One bee loose in here  And this is  Turn it over  Yeah  Oh my god  Look how many  Are on the bottom  Yeah  Kidding  There's got to be  Close to a hundred  In this jar as well  And then individual wasps  You know mixing them together  Might really get them angry  Yeah  Oh what like  Different camps  Yeah  You mix the wasps  And the honey bees  And stuff  Big race war  Some kind of  Conglomerated  A lot of 
[00:28:00]  Mongrel  Class of B  The balls will be  The battlefield  Yeah  That's for sure  That's great  And this is just  The grand finale  Yeah  Finale  Excuse me  The ultimate challenge  It's the ultimate challenge  This is like a decathlon  Of the nutsack  We're just waiting  For the beekeeper suits  They're coming at 8 o'clock  I want a beekeeper suit  Alright  I'm going to have to put  A beekeeper suit on  Let's bring the EMT guys in  I want to see  Some of the dangers  You guys can hang out  Just go to the back wall 
[00:28:30]  For a little bit  We don't have many mics  That's why  Here they are  Here are the EMT guys  We're outside the studio  Almost every morning  To say hi to us  And now we finally need them  Our buddies  Anytime we need them  They are here to help out  Never a dull moment  With you boys  I gotta say  No  And they have been there  For all the fun things  They were there  At the Hard Rock  Remember the Hard Rock  When someone suggested  What was the really bad suggestion  That we knocked down  Somebody wanted to swallow  A knife 
[00:29:00]  Yeah a guy wanted to  Swallow a knife  Oh yeah  For St. Paddy's Day  And we were  Dead set against that  And these guys  Kind of confirmed  That that was a real  Stupid thing to do  So we just had a guy  Piss his pants  Which is harmless  Good harmless fun  We had a drunk  Come up on stage  And piss his pants  In front of hundreds of people  What else have you guys  Been involved with  With us  55 gallon drum challenge  That's right  Were you the ones  That dragged the one girl  Out on the stretcher  Yeah the one that got  The cockroach in her ear 
[00:29:30]  Nice  She got a cockroach in her ear  And they couldn't get it out  With their equipment there  So she had to be brought  To the hospital  Now the fun part of that was  It wasn't just a cockroach in her ear  She had been in the bottle  In the bottle  In the drum for quite a while  Yeah  And we had been dumping  Cow blood on her  And all kinds of  Disgusting stuff  So as these guys  Are taking her down  In the stretcher  She's covered in blood  What a mess  It looked like she had been  Just stabbed  Hundreds of times  The building was horrified  People were horrified  Horrified 
[00:30:00]  Yeah  But they took her down there  And pulled it out of her  New York being the wonderful city  Nobody just  No  This stalking look  Got a gawk  The maniacal look of madmen  If there were camera phones  Back then  Would have been a lot  A lot of pictures  So the beekeepers  Suits or whatever  Are coming  The one guy has some spray  That can calm the bees down  If he gets too crazy  No it kills them  Kills them on contact  Oh yeah  Yes  Zyklon bee  Just seems to  Calms them down  Yeah  Good one 
[00:30:30]  And these guys are telling us  They're not allergic  But let's say  They have an allergic reaction  That's why you guys are here  Yeah  Airway will close up  They'll swell up  Itching  A whole lot of fun stuff  The airway closes up  Closes up  An allergic reaction  The airway closes up  And that's why we're all concerned  By the way  Any of you boys allergic?  I don't know  I don't know  Now  That's what I meant to ask  How about you guys?  Does this  Do you build up an allergy over time?  Or if you're not allergic at 8  Will you maybe be allergic in your 40s? 
[00:31:00]  No straight answer to that  It could change  Almost overnight  It could just change  You don't know  Do you have stuff with you?  Yeah  What do you got?  Show us what you got  Got some FB  Show us the tools of the trade  You got the FB  You got the FB  Ambulance  Cardiac monitor  We got  Not the pen thing  We go direct for the IV drugs  I was given a pen thing  Because I had a really bad allergic reaction  To  I think  I guess it turned out to be chickpeas  Or hummus or something  Oof  And I was in  I was in the emergency room  You were stung by a chickpea?  The hell does that even happen? 
[00:31:30]  And then I went to an allergist  And they wanted to give me one of these pens  That you stab yourself with  Wow  You have to stab yourself with it violently  Yeah  It's a harpoon  It's like a harpoon  Dude, they got the paddles  You got the paddles?  Cardiac monitor  Nice  Can you fire those babies up or what?  Hey, that's the finale  That's the finale  You guys have to take the paddles to the balls  What would happen if he's looking for a new job?  Only before you do it  Hold on, hold on, hold on  What would happen if you took the paddles to the balls?  Not good  Not good? 
[00:32:00]  Not good at all  You can't even joke about that  I hear if you do it  You do have to put the paddles in  And yell queer  Instead of the normal clear  Just kind of gay  You know, I hear there are people that pay big money for that too  Yeah  Wow  Dropping in the tubes for the airway  Manage their airway if we need be  And yes, all the technical individuals out there  There is a medic in the room  Before you start getting all the phone calls  Yeah  It's not just some guy that bought this stuff on eBay  And I think I know how to use this  Yeah  Wow, great

[00:34:00]  How you doing?  Alright  You guys got girls coming in  Why not get the girls to blow through the tube for you?  Dana  We have girls coming in today?  We do  Why are we listening to Dana?  Are you scheduling our guests?  No, I thought you guys said you guys had girls coming in today  No  It's just another sausage factory  Oh, man, that sucks  All I see is guys everywhere we look  No, we don't want girls coming in  But it's safe for that way, trust me  Women wreck radio shows  Unless they're getting naked  Two years later, she'd be in court saying 
[00:34:30]  They held my head to the tube  And made me blow  I was degraded  Shut up  How disorganized are we, though?  A caller suggests something  And we're like, really?  Alright  It must be so  Good, good  Maybe we're just coming in, alright  Maybe we just forgot, I don't know  Bring them right in  Alright, Dana, thanks  Thanks  Alright, so I think we're all set  And the guys are here?  The contestants?  The competitors?  Everyone's here  How does that?  Wow  That never happens  I'm stunned  They're here? 
[00:35:00]  The guys?  Iraq?  Wow, Iraq  Hawk?  Iraq's got a look on his face  How about you turn on the wireless mic you're holding  Yeah, what are you trying to do?  Before you look around  Iraq has this  Turn on the mic  Iraq has a clueless surprise look on his face  That I can only describe as Iraq  Thanks  That's right  Come on, Puxatoni Eric  I'm in here  I didn't see if the contestants come in here yet  I was trying to find out for you  How do you find out by looking around the room?  Yeah, how?  Checking in the other studio  Maybe they saw the contestants come in 
[00:35:30]  I don't know  You think they're going to help you with a nod?  They're going to let you swing and not know what you're talking about?  They're going to let you just sweat  Hang you out to dry  You should know that by now  Steve  Let's get  Iraq  Prognosticator of prognosticators  Has determined  Blah, blah, blah  Nothing  Huh?  Jesus  Steve, we got the contestants here?  I saw it  Grr  Grr  I think they were all contestants  I don't know  Grr  Grr  Grr  Can you tell when Steve puts his headphones on?  Grr  We'll get everyone out for 
[00:36:00]  Right when he starts talking  Yeah  We got two of the guys here?  I think if one of the guys might have brought a couple extra people with him  But there are people filling out paperwork, yes  Yeah  They're going to be filling out paperwork for the next hour and a half  Yeah, they absolutely will  Because just when people come in here to do dumb things  You got to fill out a packet  Oh, yeah  I can only imagine what they're filling out today  Extensive  Extensive paperwork  Yeah  Are you scared of these things, Steve?  Wasps?  Yeah  Not really  I mean, I've been stung by a bunch of them before  It's not fun  But  You want to just stick your hand in real fast? 
[00:36:30]  Absolutely not  Is it true your grandfather visited Cuba in 1956?  Yeah, I don't see what that has to do with my ball bag going in a bee jar  Right, well  Are you or were you ever a member of the Communist Party, sir?  Have to ask these questions, gentlemen  That is very funny  Let's say hi to Joe in Brooklyn  Joe?  What's going on, boys?  Hey  Hi, Joe  All right, two things  First thing is those Wasps that the Verizon guys got there  I work for Verizon and Wasps are no fucking joke 
[00:37:00]  We've all been stung by them once you go up on a pole  Secondly, Ron and Fez have got to be fucking panicking  Because you guys know that Ronnie says, quote  These guys have no sense of fucking history  Every time you guys do a bit, they panic because they think they're going to walk in and have no job  It is a pretty crazy way to run your life  I know, I don't like doing this either  Any more than Opie doesn't  It's our job, though  It's our job to lay it all on the line every once in a while  What can I tell you? 
[00:37:30]  It's nice being back, you know, at the base every so often  But sometimes you've got to go out on patrol  Yep  Yep  And you just go into that great unknown  It just makes this show so special  Right  The chances we take  And sometimes when you go on patrol, you leave without your weapon  Just making the Arabic woman noise  I know  Alone  I know, listen  We are pretty stupid  Let's go to Big Mike  Big Mike  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey  Hey, you're going to have to have the other contestant blow into the tube for the other guy 
[00:38:00]  With his guys' ball bag in there  That ain't bad  Because that way, it's like playing defense on football  You know, you got the  You anger them more  If you got, like, Jimmy or Ben doing it  Then, you know, you don't know if it's the same thing  Yeah, the other guy's going to do it with some gusto  Yeah  The harder you blow, the angrier the B gets  The angrier the B's going to get  What a great idea  We'll have them 69 each other  Right  That's another ball bag challenge, too 
[00:38:30]  Oh, fantastic  Thanks, guys  Watch it out  I hope everyone saw the contraption on opianathlete.com  It's ridiculously phallic  And now we learn that someone has to blow into the tube to get the B's excited  I'm not going to lie to you  I'm a little nervous today  Just a little  I'm getting that feeling that I get just every once in a while  You know what I love, though?  Have you had it twice already?  I've had the feeling only twice  Yes  I love the fact  No, actually  Sorry  I didn't mean to interrupt you, Anthony 
[00:39:00]  I'm just going to  Actually, I've had that feeling since coming to XM a lot  Which is ridiculous considering our history  Yeah  Like you would think coming into this new gig we would never get that feeling again  I can think of three times already that I've had this exact feeling I have today  But  It's  It's been cleared  This has all been cleared  It can happen  You're a stupid man  It's not like Sex for Sam was something that had been done times before 
[00:39:30]  You're a stupid  Oh, that's right  It happened  It's not like everyone knew about it  Oh, they did  It's not like it had sponsors  Oh, it did  This has been cleared by everybody  Everyone's signing release forms  This sounds way too familiar  Oh, God  I'm buying a house  The only reason they accepted this is because I'm sure they sold that shit out of it  Oh  But they didn't have the heart to tell you guys that they're just not interested anymore 
[00:40:00]  And this is their way of doing it  Like, yeah, go ahead, do the contract  You know, I thought that exact thing last night when I was going to bed  I'm like, what if they're playing us?  What if they don't want to pay out our contracts?  What if they really want to get rid of us  But they don't have the heart to do it face-to-face in an office  And they're like, they found out we're doing this and just said, yeah, let them do this  Well, you know what?  I don't think they're doing that  And it's like I always say  I mean, my friends at Sirius  I mean, that's a great company  And Mel and those guys are probably, you know 
[00:40:30]  You know, Howard, a pioneer  I'll say  Satellite radio  And the collection of people he's bringing aboard  Great, great talent  Second to none  Second to none  And to tell you the truth  I would be honored  To go over there  And work for Sirius  Would you call Howard your boss?  He would be  Why wouldn't I?  I would actually walk in and go  Morning, boss  Morning, boss 
[00:41:00]  No name  Right  Sellouts  Let's go to Jeremy in Jersey  Jeremy  Hey  Hello  Hey  Listen, Harvey Keitel said  You're going to be okay  You're going to be okay  We're into our 17th month  Moments when my phone rang  I'm like, uh-oh  Here we are again  Yeah, of course  See, I'm from the school of thought  That some of the more tamer things  That we didn't prepare for  Were more dangerous  Than the bigger things that we do prepare for  Like the tamer thing 
[00:41:30]  So what?  Perhaps there was a little drinking going on  Maybe a few liberties were taken  With some of the females at the party  We don't know  Perhaps  There's no video  Do you think there's video  Do you really think that if somebody was drunk in this studio  I would have taken them into where Ron and Fez's studio is right now  And fucked them  Never  A lot of condom  Do you really think I would have done that?  Never  Bye Mr. Logan  Bye Eric  This is too close to home  All right, Elo  Elo, thanks for the support, I guess 
[00:42:00]  We love Elo  Look at him  He's right there with us  And he will be at the end  I don't know  They won't call me back either  That's how it all begins  Hey folks, this is Adam West  From Family Guy  And other things that you know about  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony  All right, we're getting ready for Super Ball  On the Opie and Anthony program 
[00:42:30]  On XM Satellite Radio  People are starting to pile into the pal talk rooms  Yes  The contestants are here  Filling out lots and lots of paperwork  They're getting videotaped  Making all sorts of statements on video  Is there any betting going on?  What kind of betting can we do?  I don't know  We'll get the contestants in here in a little while  But they're definitely going through all the paperwork  I bet that I can sleep late tomorrow  Without being late for work  What was the other thing I was going to say? 
[00:43:00]  Oh yeah, Steve Kim comes in here  You know Steve  And E-Rock goes  Steve, what's wrong?  He goes, oh, this is so stressful  Half the stuff that these guys brought in  We'll never make it into the studio  We have to say no right off the bat  Really?  So we should get Steve in here  Steve is shrugging  What, it was bad to mention this?  Grr  Maybe Steve is just sick of coming in here and getting abused  I think Steve is just disgusted 
[00:43:30]  Steve, what's wrong?  No, no, no, no, no, no  I saw you kind of rolling your eyes  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  As I said that in the other studio  Grr  You know, I  Whatever  Yeah, some of the stuff they brought in  You know, will not make it on the air  Like what?  Like what?  Vice grips  Well, yeah, vice grips are a little much  Yeah  I don't think you're going to be able to  Do anything with vice grips  Yeah, no, anything  Well, one guy was going to bring  One of those industrial like C-clamp kind of vices  Yeah  He was going to bring that  That got nuked last night  What else got nuked last night? 
[00:44:00]  Rat trap  A rat trap would cut your ball sack off  Completely off  Someone sent in a few rat traps in a cardboard box this morning  We looked at them and they almost took my finger off  When I was like setting up  Do you have them here?  Yeah, bring in the rat trap  Oh, bring in one  At least one  All right  Maybe bring in two  I want to see a rat trap  Bring in the stuff you said no to  Yeah  Okay  Just lay it on the table  This is kind of like the video you get to see  When they do the airport  Yeah  Stories and stuff  And they show you the boxes  Stuff they got off people 
[00:44:30]  Here's what we have confiscated so far  I want to see the stuff they're saying no to  I want this contest to be safe  I think that they should let in cotton balls  And maybe some sugar  Perhaps an apple  Things that tickle  Yeah  So that the one that giggles the most  Loses  He loses  So  Wow  These two  What is  Lovely devices are rat traps  Let me see that  Here we go  Wow, those look like  Looks like someone built the better one  Somebody was going to take this to their nutsack?  They wanted to 
[00:45:00]  Get the fuck out of here  That is  You know what that is?  It's a miniature bear trap  Dude, this  That is a bear trap  All right, let me try  Put something in there  Yeah, give me something that  Oh  Yeah, no thanks  Look at this  Dude  Watch this  Let me see it  No, it's going to flip up or something  Is it on pal talk?

[00:45:30]  It's not going to attack you on its own  It can  Let's play toss the rat trap  Let's not  I don't want to play toss the rat trap  Kind of like, you know, the old egg toss game  Let's play it with a rat trap  Let's not and say we did  Hey, Jim  No  Don't toss the rat trap  Wow  The whole trap jumps up  That's frightening  Yeah  Can you take a finger to that, you think?

[00:46:00]  Just  Yeah  Just snap  Just  Ow!  Okay  Shit  It's called T-Rex  It's a black  It looks like a black mouth with teeth on it  The trap's called T-Rex?  That was at barely half volume on my hand  And it really hurt  You see that?  It doesn't look like a mouth  I feel like I'm trying to sneak a muffin past Patrice  Like, uh  Oh, he got it  Oh, those things rock 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I kind of like these  Someone has to take a body part in there  Just to try it out  I can't load mine now  Let me see  Oh, yes you can  Oh  It's supposed to snap  You broke it already?  Uh-oh  I don't know  Ow!  It doesn't hurt  It hurts a lot  It doesn't  Oh good, you broke it  That one's busted  Oh!

It will break your hand  Yeah, that's designed to snap around  Dude, I'm doing this right here  Yeah  That, just being closed like that  Really fucking hurts  Yeah  I closed it around like my knuckle  Ah!  Oh  Look what it did to the pen  Yeah  Yeah  It broke it  Oh, wow  Yeah, you just cracked your pen  Alright, so they can't use this on their scrotum  Oh, God, imagine your scrote in that 
[00:47:30]  Nope  No rat trap  There's no way to like  To disarm it without breaking  Like popping it  There's no way to disarm it  No  Right  Stop throwing them  Well, maybe if you give it your eyes  So disarming  Disarm it, Jim  Let me just give it these baby blues  Blink, blink  And by the way, I gotta say  We gotta talk about Rich Voss at one point today  Because I heard he did everything  Oh, my God  We got the audio  Yeah, I listened  We gotta get him on the phone  Or, could he stop by even?  Is he in the area?  Maybe we could get Voss to stop by 
[00:48:00]  Did the miscarriage  He did the miscarriage joke on commercial radio  And the laughter that comes out of those guys' mouths  To try to cover up for just a horrific story  Is worth the price of admission  Oh, really?  Alright  Which is free  Because it's, you know, with a golf free app  We'll check that out a little later  John  I have the sniffles  I see that  Stay away from me  No  I just got over the flu  I won't give it right back  I took three fucking weeks  Hopefully it doesn't go to full-blown sniffles  No, I don't have FBS  John in Virginia  John 
[00:48:30]  Hey, boys  What's going on?  Hey  I just want to let you know  Before I let you know  What my plans are for today  I'm calling from Lynchburg  Fucking Virginia  Home of Jerry fucking Falwell  And there's wow stickers  Already in this conservative  Oh, cool  Good  Love it  Hey, listen  Here's my plan  I got up an hour early  Just to listen to the Super Bowl  Told my wife  I gotta go to work early  Called my boss  Called in sick  I'm sitting in my minivan  Yeah, the six-pack  I'm ready to roll  All right  Yeah, we gotta make a day of it  They're tailgating, Opie  They're tailgating  For Super Bowl 
[00:49:00]  Oh, it is Super Bowl  Watch out  All right  Are the guys done with their paperwork?  Almost  Almost  We have to get videotaped statements from them  And the vice grips  Oh, yeah  The vice grips  Those weren't going to pass either  I'm amazed we're doing this today, by the way  We've been trying for five years  To do the old  Yeah  Beasting to the ball bag  This started at WNEW  We were told we had a great prize  An Aztec  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't mention the prize  Because these guys are kind of doing it for free today  No, but  No, I'm mentioning the prize because we never got it 
[00:49:30]  Right  It was  Wasn't that stupid  What's his name?  Our promotion guy  Roger  Roger  I am going to get you guys two Aztecs to give away  Oh, great  Okay, that sounds good  And then we came up with the bee sting thing  And they said no  And then they told us we didn't have the Aztec  It was a bunch of bullshit  So we gave away an actual Aztec Indian  Who I hope is still with that family  Just standing there in front of the cigar store 
[00:50:00]  Drunk in a gutter on 57th Street  Ah, juicy fruit  All right, we get it  Just keep mopping  Just keep mopping  All right  As the guys fill out the rest of their paperwork  And do their video statements  So they don't sue anyone  What do you rock?  Ben?  The bee suits are here  The bee suits are here?  Yes  Ooh  How many?  Let the Super Bowl begin  Three beekeeper suits?  Yeah, bring the beekeeper suits in  Are they heavy? 
[00:50:30]  Are they thick and hot?  They're nice  Are they nice and lightweight?  And where are the contestants?  Do they fill out all their paperwork?  Ooh  Wait, Ben, get on mic  Did you hear that?  What?  As they bring on the bee a little while  They're still filling out the paperwork  I go, Ben  Wow  He goes, they're not even close to finished  With the paperwork  It's going to be a little while  Yeah  All right  Those look silly  We're not trying to stall to make you listen longer  Because  Did you hear what Jimmy just said?  What?  I said, those look silly 
[00:51:00]  Those look silly  Of course, they're beekeepers outfits  Jimmy, they're always silly  Jimmy, put the thing on  I don't want it  I'm going to look dumb  I was going to call it a hat  But is it a hat?  Yeah, I guess it is a hat  All right  I didn't see the hat part  Put that on  Silly in this  Put that on for Paltalk  And get a picture for  For opiananthony.com  I want my beekeeper hat  Oh my God  I don't like wearing a beekeeper hat  I don't like it  Can I see that one? 
[00:51:30]  I feel like a boy in a cage  All right  And Anthony has his beekeeper hat  Look, it's got like  Hey, kook  Why don't you take your regular hat off first?  Yeah, which way does it go?  Over the head  What do you think?  Yeah, right over your head  Yeah, netting first  And Anthony has his beekeeper hat  Net thing on  I'm ready  Ugh, you look just like me  No, I don't  That is really creepy  You know what the most frustrating thing is? 
[00:52:00]  I feel like we're at the end of a movie  And we want to kiss  But our beekeeper masks are preventing us from doing so  Broke back beekeepers  I know how to quit you  You look ridiculous  No, it won't work that way, you goose  He's trying to put the headphones on  Let me try it under my beekeeper  There we go  All right  All right  I'm rocking now  Wait  Hello, caller  Hello  Hello, caller 
[00:52:30]  I can't hear the caller, Opie  And we got the wasps  Yes  We got the wasp hanging out  Some bees  I am so excited  How's that?  Oh, it works with the headphones on  Yeah, but the hat doesn't go quite over your head  You just kind of  Why does the hat have to look so wacky?  It's fucking awful  Why does the hat have to look wacky?  Dude, I want a Kangol beekeeper hat outfit  All right  Thank you, by the way  There you go  Oh, that's better  Now I can hear  You know who you look like? 
[00:53:00]  The guy from Poltergeist 2?  God is in his holy temple?  Oh, when he's talking through the screen?  Yeah  When the old man comes to the screen door?  You're all gonna die  You're all gonna get stung  All right  All right, well  We're just stalling and waiting for the guys to pull out their paperwork  Before we start Super Bowl  I might just wear this  Like on the way home, driving  Let's just walk down the street in our beekeeper fucking  You know what you do?  Two of us walk down the street in our beekeeper uniforms 
[00:53:30]  And we'll walk anywhere and just stand there  And people will think that there's bees all over  There's bees  Miss, miss  I have to check your panties  Clear the way  Anyone have a hammer?  What, um  Sir?  Sir  Beekeeper guy  Beekeeper suit guy  Why does Opie get the prettier one?  What is that one?  This is, uh  This is an antique  Beekeeper  Oh!  Give that to Opie, the old one  I don't want that  An antique  Yeah, and you put the whole suit on  Yeah  And then you zip the, uh  You know, you zip the veil 
[00:54:00]  You zip the neckline  Yeah  Around the collar of the suit  I see  Now what, what else about, like, wrist protection  Or gloves, or  Well, you should be wearing gloves  And if you didn't bring your gloves  You know, you're  I'm pretty much  You're pretty much  I'm gonna pull my hands in the sleeves  That's the way to do it  And rubber band them shut  Yeah, then  Actually, the newer suits  They may have a little elastic on the, uh  On the wrists  Cause I don't want them crawling up my arms or legs  You definitely don't want that  Nobody does  No  You guys look really silly  Well, yeah, but 
[00:54:30]  You know what  Silly, but safe  You look beyond silly  Why does anyone have a  There's one  Anthony and I have little  Hats  This is to be  You're supposed to wear this with a hat  You put the hat on  You're gonna bring your own hat  A regular hat, yeah  That's stupid  Well, see, they've advanced  They've advanced  Yeah, because the bee could get in through that hat hole  Yes  I don't like that  Yeah, it's  I don't want that  We're wearing like  You have the right one  This looks like it's sort of like a Park Ranger hat  Yeah  And it's got, like, screen all the way around it  Well  And then this very flexible screen to the bottom of it 
[00:55:00]  That zips into the suits  Yeah, well, the pictures will be up on opianthony.com  I like this  Yeah  Someone's gotta roll video on this  So I could superimpose huge giant bees invading our studio tonight  Yeah, Japanese hornets  Yes  Get some Japanese hornets  Okay, I'm gonna do this  Alright, someone roll tape on this  Alright, I'm waving them all around  I'm trying to get them off of me  Okay  Ah, ah, ah 
[00:55:30]  Oh, that'll look good  I have to do it in the background, too  Because it would look silly  Yes  If bees were only in your side  If just me  Bees would love you, too, Jimmy  That's right  We'll look like assholes  Screw that  Mmm  How do you drink a beverage in your bee suit?  Yeah, I never thought of that  What if the beekeeper gets thirsty?  Yeah  You have to plan ahead  Yeah, you gotta drink and piss  Any kind of bodily function has to be done beforehand  Before  What if you have diarrhea?  And there's bees all over  What if you have diarrhea and you want to get blown?  What do you do?  How are you sure the bees are off of you before you take the suit off? 
[00:56:00]  You should do it with a partner  Yes  Yes  Ah, that's sexy, too  Always good with a partner  That makes it sexy  What are you doing back there?  Checking for bees  Checking for bees  Checking for bees  That's it  And gathering the honey  Jesus  Open that up  Let me scoop my hand in there  See if there's no bees on it  Yeah, because I always  Anytime you see a beekeeper working  I see it on, like, the Discovery Channel  Things like that  There's bees all over them  And they don't seem to care  And it petrifies me 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, and even if you know you don't have any bees on you anymore  When you're driving home in the truck  You think you still have bees on you  Yeah  Yeah  Well, thanks for bringing in the bee suits  Thank you  I also brought you some  These are T-Rex  Oh, that was you?  Oh, that's you  You crazy bastard  These are rat snaps  But they're one-handed  And they would really hurt  Dude, how do you  There's also a mouse  Would that break your finger?  No  No, it didn't  No, what did I say?  It could  It could 
[00:57:00]  It definitely would break your finger  Yeah, make sure you get a lot of meat in there  You know  I want to be brave enough to take one  But I don't know  No way  Do you break your finger?  Well, I think I would go in with my hand  That's the way you got to do that  The side of the feet of your hand  Let me tell you something  I rested it  I opened it and closed it like slowly on my hand  Like past the pinky where the bone is  Yeah  Just letting it rest there  It left like those little teeth indentations in my hand  Yeah, it's got teeth like a bear trap  Well, you know, the teeth  It's so that if the rat or the mouse is not killed immediately  He will be suffocated by the teeth 
[00:57:30]  So, you know, they're thinking  So your business is like pest control, obviously  But you would wear this bee suit if someone had a bee problem?  Actually, we don't really do bee work  But we like to have the suits handy  Just in case  You never know when  Yeah  You get a big hornet's nest on the side of the house  In the summertime  Your kids are trying to go in the pool  And dad's got to dress up like this  And go, honey, stay in the house  I'll take care of it  And just make a disaster out of the whole thing  No, the best thing to do is wear your beekeeper suit 
[00:58:00]  When your friends don't have them  And then start rattling up the bees  Yes  Hey, bees, you look like a bunch of faggots  And you swat the nest  How hysterical would that be  To have a big jar of bees  Go to a park during a picnic  And just release them in your bee suit  That's right  Or you find the invalid kid in the wheelchair  And just throw the bees on them  And you could stand right there laughing at them  Because you have the bee suit on  Do you want to hear a tragic story about a guy who  I think it was a killer bee story 
[00:58:30]  It was a guy pushing his invalid kid  Which is, of course, where I got that  In a wheelchair  Oh, no  In a wheelchair  And he pushed the kid into a ditch  By accident at a park or something  Accident  And there was a whole killer bee nest  In the ditch  Oh, no  And they swarmed up all over the little fella  And the guy tried to beat them off of some  But he had to wind up running away  So he leaves his kid in a wheelchair  In a ditch being stung to death  Oh, he fucking hightails it out of there  Oh, that is horrible  That's not going to be some insurance questions on the claim 
[00:59:00]  All right, we got the bee suits  Ben, are they done with the paperwork?  No  When are they going to be done with the paperwork?  It's time for Super Bowl  We've got to videotape them signing the paperwork  Right  Saying they know what they're doing  It's going to take a while  We know that  Well, we actually should be done pretty soon  We're moving faster now  All right, because a lot of people are heading into work  So they're going to have to catch us on the replay, I guess  I'm scared  Which one are you wearing, Jimmy?  This one  Will that, like, a jumpsuit type thing?  Is it a jumpsuit?  Yeah, it's a one piece  Will it fit over my clothing? 
[00:59:30]  Absolutely  So I don't have to get naked in here in the studio again?  Oh, Anthony, stop it  Sometimes after the show, me and Jim, you know  But we're not really naked  It's just a couple of hogs coming out for a peek  Why not, I say  Don't make it bad  All right  We're getting ready for Super Bowl  They're videotaping the contestants  As they fill out their paperwork  We should be underway very, very soon  Yeah, it takes a while  We want to make sure everything  See, in the old days  It would have just been run in the studio  Right  Do it 
[01:00:00]  Big problem  Got the bees, got the wasp  Yeah, we'd have been like  Ah, vice grips, sure  Rat trap, yeah  Snap it on your nutsack, asshole  Right  And what happened?  What happened?  We would have gotten fired  All right  Scared  Why are you scared?  Hey, can't they sting through this screen if it, like  Yeah, that's why they designed that way  Your nose like this?  No, they can't  They can't get through there?  You know, guys  Try to keep your head centered  Right  Don't lean forward  Yeah, don't put your head like  Don't sleep on it on the side  I was gonna, like, take a little nap  But if I lay on a bee, it's over 
[01:00:30]  Let's  Yeah, let's get Steve and Ben in here  Steve  Well, we just want an update  Because we're live on the show  Yeah  Look at Steve  He's disgusted  The update is  They're filling out their paperwork  And we're videotaping  And how much longer, Ben?  A couple minutes  Really?  Yeah  We just gotta make sure that everything  That they acknowledge on camera  That they know what they're doing  It's like a deposition  Yeah  Very accurate  25 to 30 minutes  Ah, screw that  Wow  I say we let the games begin 
[01:01:00]  Hey  Oh, you asshole  What did you do?  You are a fucking maniac  Dude  What the fuck?  Where is it?  I didn't  Oh, man  Oh, jeez  Zip up, fellas  Oh, no  Where?  I think I saw it fly off 
[01:01:30]  You are an ass  Why would you do that?  I hope you get cut  On that glass now  I think I see him  We might need the spray  To kill him  Yeah, you think?  What else are you doing?  The games have begun  Let's open the door  And ask him to leave  I don't know where it is  But it's somewhere  Loose in the studio  Jesus Christ 
[01:02:00]  Your face  Was priceless  I don't like bees  I hate them  Well, I broke one of the jars  That contained a few of them  Where?  Oh  Oh, God  All right, please  Give me this suit  You see him anywhere?  Do you see him?  No  No, I don't  You're right, I think  No 
[01:02:30]  Jesus  His hair's all disheveled  Did you see that?  Oh, what a mess  Under  Well, we need to clean up the jar  I'm shaking  Because they're in here somewhere now  Where's my bee suit?  They're quickly putting on their bee suits  Jesus  I don't like the fact  Dude, how do you cover your ankle?  My ankle's exposed  No, it's pinched at the bottom  You're all right  It's not pinched that good  Pull it down over the top of your head  No, it'll bite me 
[01:03:00]  No  Pull it down over the top of your head  No, I'm a professional  Holy  Anthony  Yeah  No  Right  Right there  All right  We should take a break  The games have begun  Wait till I get my bee suit on  The games have begun  You ass  Hey, what's going on?

[01:08:00]  I'm in a bit of a quandary  Can you drink it through the B-suit?  No you can't  I'm gonna try  Yeah you can  I'm sure that net is nice and clean  Yeah guys hands it all over  It's filtering it  I'm not that crazy  Alright  Can we get the guys in here?  The paperwork from Washington is just fucking up our show today  This is why I want to hold it  This shouldn't take an hour and a half  To prepare for a stupid bit that's gonna take 10 minutes  Here they are 
[01:08:30]  Ladies and gentlemen  Sociopath number one  Alright and your name is?  Steve  You are Steve  Oh this is the last minute guy  From after that  You're not allergic to B's right?  No I am not  What did they make you fill out?  Just released a liability  I hold you guys responsible for nothing  It's all on my own  All on your own  All on your own  And they got you on tape saying that too right?  Yes they do  This is the same thing as if you just did it at home on your own in your basement  Pretty much  Yeah  And Ben's laughing 
[01:09:00]  You laugh when the bee stings you  Why are you laughing Ben?  Jim just looks funny in his outfit  You think?  Tricky in his Starbucks  The beekeeper's outfit  Of course it looks ridiculous  It's always good when there's a stretcher you know outside the studio  I know  We've taken all the precautions that we should  Now the bees are not in the contraptions yet are they?  Yeah how are we gonna get them in the contraptions?  Bill?  The bees are not currently in the contraptions  This is how it's gonna work  Yeah  There's a safety gate between the actual unit that the balls are going in and the tube 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  You put the bees in with the gate on  And you close the tube at the end  And then they're gonna put it on their balls  And when they're ready they're gonna open the gate  And the bees will come into the container  With their nuts  Yes  Because each one of you will have to blow into the tube  To force the bee into the nutsack region  Of the other man  There's still a  We have to figure out how we're gonna get that  Oh Bill come on  We need a blower  We need a blower  Alright 
[01:10:00]  And that's the ultimate challenge by the way  Hi Steve  Look at this cocky guy  This is Raphael right?  Sir  I can tell  This is Raphael from Connecticut  Representing the CT  Yes  Raphael from Connecticut  Started this whole ball bag abuse thing  Yeah  He suggested the mousetrap to the nutsack  Yep  He couldn't get down here in time  So Matt stole your thunder  And now that video's being downloaded all over the world like crazy  Raphael was not happy about that  So he challenged Matt to a ball bag abuse 
[01:10:30]  To a super ball  Yeah  To a super ball basically  What did you bring in for your nutsack today?  I brought in a  I call it the chomper  The little spatula that you pull back  And just  That's kind of interesting  I brought some vice grips  But they said it was too dangerous  Yeah  I brought the glue traps in  They shot the glue traps down  How did they shoot the glue traps down?  They won't  They will not let us do the glue traps  Why?  They shot them down  What's the  I want a reason  I didn't get a reason  Let me play devil's advocate  Because they can rip your ball skin off 
[01:11:00]  I will not rip your ball skin off  I'm just saying  That's probably what they're thinking  It's just  It's sticky stuff  It's like flypaper  It would just remove hair I'm thinking  Yeah  What else did they say no to?  Steve had brought a stapler  God we work for a weird company  It's like you can't use  Stapler  Stapler  You can't use glue traps  But you could  Get stung into balls by bees repeatedly  Over and over again  That's okay  But I can't put my sack on a fucking glue trap  Wait are your balls pretty tough?  Are you like  When you guys bang chicks 
[01:11:30]  Are you into a girl like  Twisting your balls and stuff like that?  Occasionally  Yeah  Okay  Alright so these guys  Are you married?  Girlfriend?  What does she think?  Engaged  What does she think?  She thinks I'm a fucking lunatic  Yeah  But that's okay  Yeah  Alright  So what are you going to do to your nutsack?  You're going to do the spatula  The spatula  The mousetrap  Let's bring all the bees out  I'm ready for the ultimate challenge  Yeah  I was thinking about possibly dry shaving my sack  And then if you guys had icy hot 
[01:12:00]  And then if you guys had icy hot  We could apply icy hot  Another brilliant scheme I thought of  Along with Steve representing Connecticut over here  Steve you're a Connecticut kid too?  Yes  You know each other?  No  Oh okay  Different ends of Connecticut  Yeah  My brilliant idea was for us to remove our shoelaces  And make one long string  And tie it around my hog and his hog  And possibly have Jimmy karate chop it  Now we didn't talk to them out there  I don't know if the lawyers know about it or what not 
[01:12:30]  I'll tell you why I would do that  But that's going to be fun  Yes Jimmy  I'm afraid if I karate chop  And someone's cock helmet will be ripped off  And then I feel like a silly goose  I think  It bounces off the floor  Ends up in your mouth  If they did want to do that  A shoelace or a string or whatever  Between the testicles with a line in the middle  And have a tug of testicles  And let's do it  Where you each then pull  And the first one to pull the other one  Over the line with your balls  Win  Let's do a tug of testicles 
[01:13:00]  Let the lawyers know  We've got to fill out new paperwork then maybe  But let's do it  Yeah let's do tug of testicles  Tug of testicles  Nobody wins  Hey wait  Is your fiancée here?  She's right outside  Actually I wanted her to  Could she be the official blower?  Because we need someone to blow into the air too  Well he has his girl with him too  Alright perfect  We've got two blowers  We'll be blowing  Boy that takes the gayness right out of this  Doesn't it?  That's right  Yeah sure  I was kind of  Alright what else you guys got?  The tug of testicles we like  Steve  What are you going to do?  They shot down my staple gun  I was going to do the old Steve-O impression 
[01:13:30]  Staple my nutsack to my leg  But the lawyer said no  Why?  God only knows  I thought you guys were on XM  I mean I thought we could do anything  Well they do have their  What's wrong with the staple gun  To the leg?  I don't know  Mutilation maybe  It comes under the head  I'm guessing  I don't know  They got to let that through  I agree  And they were small staples  I mean they were only  Quarter inch  Six millimeter  Not major  So what are you going to do to your nutsack?  I'm going to make a cup of tea  I'm going to teabag a cup of hot water  Wow 
[01:14:00]  That machine gets really hot too  Of course it does  Yeah  Jesus  Alright  That's his special trick  Where's the third guy?  Where's Matt?  He's almost done  He's still doing paperwork  Wow the paperwork  Holy shit  These guys got here almost an hour ago  Video confessions  Yeah  These guys are fucking fearless man  Unbelievable  I'm watching them both talk about  The things they're going to do  To their testicles  Very casually  And if I was either one of you  I'd be very psyched out  By the other  But neither one of you are  You're both like  Yeah  Let's do it  No  I'm ready to whip it out right now  Let's get something in here 
[01:14:30]  Let's start this  Fuck it  Let me get a mousetrap  Come on  Usually there's a lot of excitement  In the studio  But we can wait on that  Rubber bands  Yeah  Lovely to the testicles  What you're going to snap like that?  Oh he's snapping rubber bands  Like that  Alright  I one time had a dominatrix  And I'm not into ball torture  But she squeezed my balls a little bit  A little tougher than I like it  And for a second I was like  Ah that was kind of hot  So I can understand liking a little bit of pressure 
[01:15:00]  Like to your balls  No  So when you're banging  Do you want them squeezed?  Twisted  Twisted  Like I wanted to bring the vice grips  And like one of the listeners  Called in earlier this week  And mentioned  You know  I go one full rotation  He goes like  I mean keep going  This guy's the real deal by the way  Yeah  I'll do it man  I'm not here to play games  I don't know much about Steve  But Raphael  You're definitely the real deal  Raphael's got his game balls on  Definitely  You can tell  Alright  Is Matt ready to come in here? 
[01:15:30]  Can we at least talk to him  And then continue?  He's getting his blood pressure and everything  Finalized  How'd you guys do on your blood pressure?  Pretty good  Yeah  Low, high, what?  Normal  Normal  Yeah  Alright  Who said no to this Steve?  DC  DC just called and said  No to the testicle tug-o-war  Oh  Why?  Now they're just shooting down anything new  Now they're getting scared  Anything new  Now they're getting scared  We had faith in them down there 
[01:16:00]  Tug-o-testicles Opie  What an event  What an event  Do you think that the lawyers  When they got involved with a satellite radio  And they're worried about FCC things  Ever thought they'd have to decide  Should we let two men tie somebody to their balls  And back up in opposite directions?  You know when you're playing  When you're doing regular tug-o-war  There's like mud in the middle?  Yeah  It would have been nice to get a gay guy or something  Waiting in the middle  Yeah  An open asshole  Oh  Oh  Oh god 
[01:16:30]  Alright  No tug-o-testicle  No tug-o-testicle  Who's bummed?  Great idea  I am too  I think we're all bummed  XM shot down anything electronic or electrical  That's kind of a bumble also  I mean electric mousetrap  Well the ultimate  Car battery  Come on  Car battery  Jesus  The ultimate challenge though  The bees  Are you guys worried a little about the bees?  Those bees look like little faggots in the jar  Wow  Bring them on  Little faggots in the jar he says  He said bring them on  Oh look at this guy  He's got a robe and everything  Matt 
[01:17:00]  Wow  Look at that  Matt  Look he's a tough guy  Matt's a problem  He's wearing a championship belt  He's got the championship belt on and everything  How's it going boys?  What's up Matt?  Wow  How's it going?  Matt  You are dressed for action  You're ready to go  Matt doesn't even have to be here today  Because he's legendary already  That mousetrap video is being downloaded everywhere now  Everywhere  What the hell belt is that?  The balls of steel championship  It's the balls of steel championship belt he's wearing 
[01:17:30]  Wow guys  That's got to intimidate you a bit  No huh?  No?  Nothing?  We'll see  Alright Matt  What did you bring in?  I brought a lot of stuff in  But it didn't get cleared  What didn't get cleared?  Rat trap  Yeah rat trap  You were going to do the rat trap to the balls?  Yeah I was going to  I brought a vice in  That didn't get cleared  No vice  Like sort of like clothespins  But a lot heavier  Tire  Not cleared  No?  No  Clamps  Are they afraid of crush trauma?  What the hell? 
[01:18:00]  Bengay got cleared  I got wax  Strips  Oh so you're going to wax your nutsack  And then slap Bengay on  That's like glue traps  Yeah it's like glue traps  Glue traps I brought in  They didn't allow that  Alright  But waxing your nutsack  You can do  That's got to be brutal  That could be a nice  Wow  That okay  That's a good one  That's a good one  Waxing the nutsack  And then putting  Bengay on it  Bengay  Yep I got Bengay also  That's got to hurt  How about  Alright now we got to organize  What we should do is  Come up with a list of events  They have to do  I'm thinking  The wax strips first 
[01:18:30]  Yeah  They all have to do a wax strip  And then immediately  Apply some icy hot  Yeah  And then  How about  Bengay was shot down  What else did you bring in Matt?  But we're using  Ben producer  I have a weird question  About the Bengay  Yes  Will that prevent the bees  From going on it?  Will that freak the bees out?  Wow  Good question  Don't want to sabotage  The grand finale  That might fuck the bees up dude  They may get sick  It might be like  I think it's going to make them  Just go nuts 
[01:19:00]  Well they wouldn't have to go in  Between rounds  And wash their balls  Like the bees may stay away  From the sack  Yeah  It may be a repellent  It's just something to think of  Oh my god  But we need the icy hot  After they do the wax strips  That would be very uncomfortable  Alright so we start with wax strips  What else did you bring in Matt?  Bengay  Alright  So I'm thinking  Help me out guys  Also regular mousetraps  I brought about six of those in  I think they all have to do  A mousetrap to the scrotum  Do we start with that?  Yeah that seems to be  Technically somebody already did one 
[01:19:30]  I'm not going to mention any names  So we can do that  Alright so we're going to start  With a mousetrap  They all have to do a mousetrap  To the scrotum  To start the competition  Right  Then I'm thinking wax strips  Is that good?  Yeah  Alright wax  Huh?  Cup of tea  Well then that'll be the freestyle  Yeah  That's the team competition  Yeah  And then we get freestyle  Then we got freestyle  Where you each get to show  Your individual talents  I'm thinking mousetrap  Wax strips  Bengay after the wax strips  If that fucks up the bees  We'll wash them  You know 
[01:20:00]  We'll have them wash up  And stuff  I know  Trust me  I stopped myself  Wash your balls  No I did not say that  Now they're going to use you saying that  We have to fight over who washes who  Yeah  I like rapheel  So then it's the Bengay  Okay  Any other  Any other  Are we doing piercings  Or any of that crap today?  I don't  I don't think so  Alright  I said no punctures though  Okay  Yeah no punctures  Seems to be the rule of the day  Except if it's you know  A bee stinger  Right  Okay so what else can we do? 
[01:20:30]  We got mousetrap  Wax strips  Bengay  What about that slap thing?  And the rubber band?  Well that I think that's his freestyle  That's his freestyle?  You're going to do the spatula?  Right?  Yes  Alright so I guess we do  One, two, three  Freestyle  And then the ultimate challenge  And I think we're pretty good  Very good  Mousetrap on sack only  No nuts  Jesus  Well we know that  These notes are coming in like crazy  We know that  There's a lot of panicky Pete's  We've done the mousetrap before  We know  Do you realize that somebody spent  All those years in law school 
[01:21:00]  And has to say  Should we allow the mousetrap  To close on the ball itself?  And they're going  No it's just the skin  Just the skin  And possibly the vein  I went to school for 12 years  I know that  That's as far as we should go  Wow  500 people in the  Jesus  Right now  Looking for this  Than if you could slowly  Because if you move it quickly  It fucks up  Grab that camera  From up there  500 people?  Yeah we're going to set up  The pal talk camera  We're going to put it in a better position  We got a two camera shoot  Happening in the studio  So we'll have video up online 
[01:21:30]  Yeah lots of video  So are we done?  Are we not?  Is there anything else  That we're not thinking of?  No then we got to go freestyle  So Raphael  You're doing what's called what?  The chomper  The chomper  Alright  He's doing the chomper  Anthony's setting up the camera  Alright  Steve  What's your freestyle bit?  I'm making a cup of tea  With my nuts  That's right Steve  Cup of tea with nuts?  Cup of tea? 
[01:22:00]  Oh boy  I don't know what my freestyle is  All my stuff is taken now  With nuts?  Yeah that's a problem  What could Matt do?  He can go sit in the corner  While the big boys play  Oh  The smack talk  Or the sack talk  This guy has to prove  He can take one first  I already took it  Yeah Matt might not have to do freestyle  Because he's the one that  Came in here already  We'll figure something out for Matt 
[01:22:30]  In New York City  I'm sure Matt could find something  To rip off from one of us  And you know  Take advantage of it again  I love the smack talk  Going on here  Uh oh  Love the smack talk  Well we can brainstorm  We can figure something out  By the time we get to Matt  Maybe we'll have something  How about you have to let  Master Poe kick you in the balls  A few times  I think he wants to  Silence  Yeah  Over the room  How about Matt has to drink  A cup of my cum  Oh  Oh my god  That raises this  To a fucking different competition 
[01:23:00]  This really is  Sexiest  I was going to say  It just got hot  A cup of my cum  Well this is the real deal though  Raphael is really pissed off  That Matt  Oh Raphael is a fucking problem  Stole his thunder  He's a problem  Not Puerto Rican  No I know  As soon as you walked in  I realized I had my judgment error  Alright let's go to  Pat in Boston  Pat  Hey I just want to know  If these guys did any pre-games  Did they get a bunch of loads out  Are they holding loads in for three days  What's the story  Yeah what was the pre-game all about  How did you guys prepare 
[01:23:30]  I broke my finger so I can feel the pain  He did break his finger  How did you break your finger  I actually work  Oh okay  What kind of work do you do  Construction  Okay  Alright  I guess we're ready  Yeah  Absolutely  Should we take a break  And then set up the studio  And we'll be ready to go  And the festivities will start  Do we have like some dramatic music  And all that  Super Bowl  I think we need some of that NFL music  Or something  Maybe some ACDC  Alright we'll figure something out  After the break  It's Super Bowl Thursday 
[01:24:00]  Yes  And it's going to get crazy in here  The EMT guys are in here  And they're ready to jump in  If they have to  What about the bees  Have they been transported  To the apparatus  Yeah how is that going  We'll do it now  Where are we going to do this  Right in that  Hey  Right in the studio right there  Right in this studio  Huh  Mr. Fancy Pants  I see you doing over there  By Ope  Why not  He's got a studio  Why not Ope you do it  Pick him out by hand  And just throw him in the tube  Yeah  You laugh at bees 
[01:24:30]  I do laugh at bees  Where are the faggots  Yeah  What are you doing  Without your hat on  I don't know  The bees aren't going to come out  Until fucking  You think I don't know  This radio show  It's fucking 930  Bees will be brought out  At 1056  Why would I wear that  It's uncomfortable  You just want to look good  Until you have to  Yeah  The girls on pal talk  Want to see me  The complaints were flying in  Just like the NFL  Where they take off their helmets  To look good on the sideline  That's what Jimmy's doing right now  No this is staying on  No it bothers my head  It itches 
[01:25:00]  Like the ear thing  Gets pressed down with the hat  I don't like it  Sorry  That's alright  Fuzzy numpkin  Calling again  Fuzzy  Yo what up boys  What's up  Yo you got the sequence  All wrong  Check it out  Alright  First you got to  Slap the mousetrap  Yeah  Then you got to  Do the wax  Yeah  Then they'll be like  Nice and fresh  And red  And open  Then you got to  Do the bees  Then to top it off  You hit it with the bengue  Yeah but then that  Messes up the ultimate challenge  Yeah  Well  It has to end  With the bees  Yeah  Yeah but then  The anti gets up 
[01:25:30]  The ultimate challenge  Becomes can you get  The bengue on your balls  After the bee sting  I thought of that too  But not for the same reason  You're thinking  I thought of it because  If the bee  Will it deter the bees  From the sting  We've already seen  Nathaniel took it  I don't think it will though  I mean if it did  People would be saying  Hey bengue  Keeps bees away  Well no one's probably  Ever been put in that position  Where they put bengue  How many old people  Are outside and getting stung  Old people get stung  All the time  You'd love to see that  Bees all over him 
[01:26:00]  Right on his joints  Where that fucking bengue is  Arthritis  Yeah  I can feel even worse  But nothing happens  Because they got the leather skin  The stingers are just  Breaking in half  They're not penetrating anything  Alright fuzzy  Thanks brothers  Alright  No we gotta do  The bees last  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  I'm a little concerned  Like Jimmy is  But it has to be last  Okay  I think it'll be alright  Like we said  We'll be more than happy  To go in and wash your balls  For you  I think it'll be okay too  After that  Jimmy will get in 
[01:26:30]  To lather him up real good  Why does it wee  And then Jimmy will get in  To lather him up  Well I hope he's gotta dry him  And I got the bee suit on  I can't do shit  These guys will wax  Like one side of their ball bag  So the other side is  Ready for the bees  Just in case  Just in case  They still have  They still have an area to go to  Yeah  Alright  Superbowl Thursday  Begins next  Hey this is Bob Saget  Yeah it rhymes with faggot  I had a fucked up childhood  You're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony 
[01:27:00]  All right  We're just about ready  We've just been informed  That Bill the intern  Has to transport the bees  Not yet  From the jars  And containers  Into the homemade apparatuses  That Keith the cop made  This is gonna be like 
[01:27:30]  Transporting plutonium  With drunks  With drunks  Let me set the scene  Is the camera set  Cause PalTalk  There's so many people  In the PalTalk room right now  Yeah a lot  It's the most people  We've had in PalTalk  Since starting the PalTalk phenomenon  Record so far  Over 500 people  Tuned in  To check this out  A lot more  Probably we'll be downloading it later  Cause people post these  Video clips up on  On the web  And yeah  Where do they post these clips 
[01:28:00]  By the way  They're all over  On people's personal websites  There's secret sites  Through Wackbag or no  Yeah  Through Wackbag dot com  Okay  Cause there's a lot of people  That don't have the PalTalk  And they're gonna want to see  Video immediately  He's doing that in here  He has to do it in here  He has to do it in here  Jimmy  Jimmy here's the deal  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  Let me just set this up  As Jimmy panics  And tries to get his bee suit  Back on  There's hundreds of bees  In these containers  We have to open up that lid  And try to get a few  Into these apparatuses  I don't see how  We're gonna do this 
[01:28:30]  Alright  Hold on  We're gonna  Oh my god  This is a disaster  Jimmy didn't hear  Jimmy here's the problem  A couple of our guys  Are allergic  To bees  They have to stay  In the production room  Hold on  No bees can be exposed  Outside of this studio  Because then  When they go  Walk out  If a bee got away  And stung them  There'd be a problem  Yeah they're in a sealed studio  Over there  The ones that are allergic  To the bees  All the bees  Have to stay in this studio  If any get loose  Huh 
[01:29:00]  Which guys  Danny's allergic  And Travis is allergic  Travis  Oh my god  You don't  Jimmy your hands  Jimmy  I know I'm waiting  For this  Hold on  Cut my ankles  Oh my god  This is just not gonna work  Alright  Is the camera  Set up nice  I am so glad  I am dressed like this now  Holy crap  Those fucking bees  Are all riled up too  Boy  They are pissed  They just woke the fuck up  How are you guys  Gonna do this  Have you ever done this before 
[01:29:30]  No  Oh my god  No no  This is uncharted territory  They haven't tested  This funnel method either  Yeah because things with wings  Go right down funnels  Another first rope  Chance of them  Flying out  This is another first rope  You and Anthony by the way  Am I zipped up  Right up to the end  Alright hold on  You gotta zip the middle up  Ant  What the fuck are you doing  Jimmy don't fuck with me  I'll kill you  Oh shit  What are you nuts  He just smashed them bees in there  Done  Holy shit dude 
[01:30:00]  Wow  It worked  No one was looking  And he just did it  That's zero  You did it perfectly  There's fucking 80 bees  Dude we didn't want 80 bees  In one apparatus though  We have to spread out the bees  Or are they gonna use the same thing  They're gonna have to use the same apparatus  They look friendly  What  There's some more bees here  And he has one  Yeah there's plenty of bees left  I gotta say  But it worked the first time  Why are we taking a chance  It's gonna work twice  Opie  Have faith in the man  I was gonna tell you  Ready set go  You know 
[01:30:30]  Be nice and dramatic  I have complete confidence  In this guy's ability  To transfer these bees  Can I say those bees  Looked sleepy before  But boy they're fucking  Wide awake now  They're starting to fly around  In that pissed off bee like way they do  Yeah  How would you feel  Alright he's  He's transferring the other bees  Uh oh  Get it in there  Get it  It's a honey bee  Nope this one isn't going as smoothly  That's a fucking honey bee  Why don't you guys act like men  Oh my god I stopped breathing  I stopped breathing  Alright we got two apparatuses  That are fully loaded  Oh now I got a feeling  Like one's on me 
[01:31:00]  Get off of me  Fully loaded  Wow they are pissed in that one man  Yeah now they're all pissed off  Those fuckers woke up  They were sleeping for the winter  And now they got fucking  They're in an apparatus  With balls ready to be put in  How would you feel  They're unpleasantly  Alright guys  This is what's gonna happen  So we gotta figure this out  We gotta figure this out  Step by step  Ant  When they start getting stung  They're gonna freak out  And drop the apparatus  And then all hell's gonna  Break loose in the studio  And I will laugh 
[01:31:30]  And laugh  And laugh  What do you got  A bee  I caught one by the wings  He's ready to sting  So if you wanna  What the hell  What do you want us to do with it  You're a fucking insane person  Don't let him go  He's holding him by his wings right now  I'll put him back in here  Yeah put him back in  I'll talk to him later  We'll see how he feels about  Oof  Let me ask  Can you hear them  Can you hear them buzzing there  Or no  No  The bees are in a soundproof booth  So they don't hear the answers 
[01:32:00]  Can they breathe in there by the way  Oh boy  Does it matter  How much air do they breathe really  Oh yeah  We don't need them  There's plenty in there  Imagine as soon as they  If I was one of these guys  I just waited for them to suffocate  Put your balls in  When they're all fucking  Just not moving  I'd play dead  By the way we didn't even promote this  But Tracy Morgan's here  Just to make this even better  All right  You're going to get your suit for Tracy  Yeah bring up  Tracy Morgan is getting his bee suit on  Oh Tracy Morgan's putting a bee suit on  And he'll be joining the festivities  Tracy Morgan rocks 
[01:32:30]  We met him a few years back  At our celebrity softball game  Yeah  And he's been a friend ever since  He is putting a bee suit on  Oh this guy is a real trooper man  Remember he went out to the pitching mound  In front of 6,000 people  In just a jockstrap  In a jockstrap  And then he jumped in the pool  We had little kiddie pools  With strippers in them  Yeah  And he jumped in  And bathed with these strippers  All right  This guy will do anything  All right  Now we're just waiting for Tracy Morgan  To get the bee suit on  And then we'll get this going  So the bees are in the apparatus  And they're pissed off 
[01:33:00]  You know something  They really came alive  These bees  Because they were kind of lethargic  In the plastic containers  Yeah  But when they're in the apparatus now  I think they sense  Soon testicles will be joining them  In there  And they're angry  Where's the guy that's got the spray  That kills them  He's outside  Oh that's brilliant  To have him out there  Have you noticed  All the protection  Is for outside of this studio  Yeah  Like there's nothing going on in here  They don't want 
[01:33:30]  A bee getting out of this  Yeah give me that spray  Compartment  Because I don't have a bee suit on  At least give me the spray  That's good  Don't spray us  I'll spray whatever  I have to  Don't spray all willy dilly  Don't open the door  You'll flood the whole compartment  He's dead already  Don't get it on your skin  Really  Why would it happen  Because it's a fucking poison  Oh okay  How about giving a guy  Can you have a fucking magazine  Rolled up  If a bee comes  Don't spray chemical poison  Oh wow

[01:43:00]  Side of his sack  In a mousetrap I believe  And he's going to go  For the right nut  Hit a nut  Now  Here we go  Here's the second one  From Raphael  A dual hit  We didn't see this coming  Anthony  We're going for two  Son of a bitch  Two mousetraps  Raphael from Connecticut  Kicking off this competition  In true  Professional style  Unbelievable  Two mousetraps  No one saw that coming 
[01:43:30]  Wow  He's giving up my taint  Unbelievable  What a kickoff  What a kickoff  To this Super Bowl  Come on  Give me another one  I've got to find some more skin  I've got to find some more skin  Where would you fit a third  Show the webcam  Show pal talk  Go ahead  Show me around  Don't move  Don't move  Wow  Jesus Christ  Dude you are brave  Opie's loading up  A third mousetrap  Alright I've got a third mousetrap  I'm handing over to Raphael  You know in the world of professional sports 
[01:44:00]  It's moments like this Opie  The unexpected things that happen  That show the true professionalism  That's what's history making  By the way who's judging this  Judging  What's the fucking judge  Let him just do this  But I mean in the end  Oh in the end  How do we pick a winner  I have no fucking idea  What does the winner get  He is now trying to find more skin  Jesus  He's pulling at different parts of his bag  I think on the left side  He's found  I found a little more  Perhaps you can squeeze it  Into the corner of the trap  It's all ball though  Make sure you push that ball back  No balls  Mike  No ball  Just get skin  That's delicious skin 
[01:44:30]  There it is  He found some skin  He's going to have to go for the corner  I think  Not going to be able to dive  Straight forward into this one  Opie  He's going to have to come in  On the corner  Alright  With his ball back  You want me to push this forward  A little bit  Hitting the detonator  He was talking about your cock  Hey Jimmy  Want to hold this for me  Push this forward  Alright here we go  Raphael's going for a third mousetrap  Come on  Third one  Alright let's  Here he goes  He's got balls  Like right there  He's trying  Watch that testicle  Yeah protect the testicles 
[01:45:00]  Here he goes  Here we go  The third one  Oh  Oh  Oh my god  Three  Three mousetraps  On his ball  Unbelievable  Wow  Unbelievable  I wish I had more skin  I'd keep going  But I'm sorry  It is just a lack of  Scrotal skin  Opie  That is keeping him  From putting even more traps  On there  I have not seen  Professionalism like this 
[01:45:30]  In sport  In years  This motherfucker should join the Marines  Or something  Anthony  It's kind of weird  I kind of like the pain  Do you  I like it  Could you not look me in the eye  Like how I say that  It's almost like an offer  Sitting there  My balls sagging  And all  Alright let's hear it for Raphael  From Connecticut  Raphael what a kickoff  On this Super Bowl  Thursday  2006  Wow that is really  Going to be hard to beat  Not only  Mousetrap to the nutsack  But a second  And then 
[01:46:00]  A third  Mousetrap  Right  This is going to be  Hard to beat  Ladies and gentlemen  Other contestants  Are you nervous  By the initial  The kickoff here  By Raphael  Three mousetraps  How do you compete  I'm sure I have enough  Sack for four  He believes  Four mousetraps  This is something  We didn't expect  I'm absolutely crying  Over here  Just being witness  To this  Is fantastic  It certainly is  Tracy any comments  So far  Man I have no comment  On this man  These dudes are  Super freaks man 
[01:46:30]  This is unbelievable  Super freaks  This is like  Watching Ali and Liston  This is like  Watching the  69  Mets in the  World Series  Again it's like  Watching the Mets  Beat the Red Sox  It's just a moment  In sport that  I'm going to say  Where were you  When they snapped  Three four mousetraps  On their bag  And I'm going to say  I have no idea  I was drunk  Unbelievable day  For sport  There's actually  I have a bet  With one of the EMTs  He said they won't  Make it through  The mousetraps  I'm like dude 
[01:47:00]  They're going to make  Oh yeah  This is nothing  The EMTs were doubting  One mousetrap  And we've seen three  We have four loaded  Mousetraps here  You had better have  A huge sack my friend  Alright now we got  Four traps  We got Steve from  Connecticut  Stepping up  To the mousetraps  Let me tell you something  Steve has an advantage  Raphael was uncharted  Territory with three  Mousetraps  He can now look  And see  And pick and choose  Where he wants to  Snap that first trap  Allowing maybe more skin  For the subsequent  Traps that will come 
[01:47:30]  I think going second  A very good strategy here  Alright here we go  Steve is stepping up  To the mousetraps  Here he goes  Not afraid  And he's not shy  To show everyone  Where's that first one going  Look Obi in the face  He's pulling as much  Yam bag over  Exposing as much  Of the right side  Of his sack as he can  He's starting on the right side  I believe working  Right to left  Right to left  Here we go  Here he goes  Detonation  Number one  Close to you goose  Oh there it is 
[01:48:00]  He's got a mousetrap  On the left side  Of his bag  He's pushing over  Obi's not even taking a second  Next trap  Lining up  He didn't even blink  I do think he's going to be able  To get two traps  On that left side of his bag  Leaving the right side  Completely open  For at least two more traps  At least two more  Here we go  Steve from Connecticut  Going for the second mousetrap  Fantastic  Fucking Steve  He's shaking  Are you alright  Yeah  He's stepping up  To the mousetrap  One fell off  I'll do it again  No biggie 
[01:48:30]  Uh oh  If the one fell off  I fell off  Now you know  Maybe you should break out  The rat traps  You will have to have  Four hanging  In order to beat that three  Yeah  Here he goes  Having a really tough time  Keeping that nut out of there  I know  It's not even cold in here  Getting enough bag  He is shaking  He's all baldness  You know right now  I believe he's probably wishing  He just got out of a warm shower  Where you have that  Great Turkish  Taffy consistency  To your yambag  Which is perfect  For this type of  Competition  Oh there it is 
[01:49:00]  Backhand  On the left side  It is hanging  That must stay now  That is  The second one's coming up  Alright  You know the studio  Was a little chilly today  And that could inhibit  The number of mousetraps  That gets in there  But as he goes on  He's warming up there  Two traps  On his yambag  And now his  Other side of his yambag  Completely exposed and open  Ready for number three  He's got plenty of room  I love how these guys  Are shaking  Mousetraps  How's it feel so far Steve  Doesn't hurt at all 
[01:49:30]  This is bullshit  Wow  Holy shit  See that's professional  That went out of hurt  God damn it  That went out of hurt  Holy shit  Fucking  He's going for number four  He's going for four  He's going for four  This is a record  Yes  Four  Three was a record  Anthony one was a record  Here he goes  Number four  My god  This is a new record  Oh my god  Opie  Opie  Four mousetraps  Are hanging from his yambag  I've seen it all  I've seen it all 
[01:50:00]  Where's the camera  You know  I've seen some things  In my day  There it is  Right there  Right there  No dude  There's the camera  Right in front of you  I'm trying to see  If I can fit one more  Oh my god  Stop it  Let's see if we can do this  Opie  Opie  I've seen Nirvana  In a small club  That's nothing  Compared if he does five  Five mousetraps  Where do you think  You're going to fit this one  Sir  Yeah where  Where  How much skin do you have there  Are you going underneath  He's going way over 
[01:50:30]  To the right hand side  Pulling some bag  From underneath  Up into the right hand side  My god  He's finding bag  Where there shouldn't be bag  Unbelievable  What are you  Arabian  He has found more bag  Yeah he certainly has  I think he's pulling up  Loose taint skin  Alright here he goes  If he gets five traps  Here we go  Number five  Oh my god  Oh one fell off  But he did have five  No no  It's not official 
[01:51:00]  They're waving it off  Come on  You're saying  It wasn't a catch  You said he didn't have possession  It wasn't on long enough  You never had complete control  Of the mousetrap  Load it again  Load it again Bill  Take those gloves  He never had complete control  Of the mousetrap  With his scrotum  How are the bees doing by the way  They still moving around  They're probably watching  Wondering where they fit into this  No shit  What do we gotta do  Alright we're going for five again  Here's Steve from Connecticut  It's Superbowl Thursday  And  Nose that forward a little  There you go  Here we go 
[01:51:30]  Number five  Make sure it stays on  Oh he's shaking  Somebody just  Used to start to hold it in place  Somebody hold it for  Somebody hold it for  Somebody was holding it for  He'll just hold it  Okay fine  Fuck it then  Just hold it there  Alright he's going for five  Hold on take your time  Oh there it is  Five traps  Are on this guy's bag  Unbelievable  Wow  Hey wait  What a great  This is going to be  A ball bag that goes down  In history  That's enough to kill  Half a mouse baseball team  We gotta go to  We gotta go to  Jim in Wisconsin 
[01:52:00]  Jim  Three  Yeah there's a little  Controversy here  Somebody ought to check  For some performance  Enhancing drugs  Have a nice day  Alright we will be  Checking for some  Type of steroids  Or performance enhancing drugs  You know to see  Five mousetraps like that  Sure the crowd enjoys it  The people love the competition  But what is it telling the kids  If they're using drugs  And a normal person  You know can't get any more  Than maybe two on there  You're getting five  I'm a little suspect here 
[01:52:30]  But I'm not going to ruin  This fine day for sport  By bringing up this  Maybe an investigation later  Maybe something  But right now  I'm just enjoying the competition  Which is fantastic  It's anyone's game  At this point  Anyone's game  Steven Raphael  Both very impressive  When I think I was stunned  At three traps  I'll be three traps  And this gentleman  Five traps  No way to beat it  I just don't see enough skin  Hey kids  Don't try this at home  Very good  You are a role model  You certainly are 
[01:53:00]  That's a good thing to say  Alright Matt is stepping up  Matt comment anything  Did we lose Tracy Morgan already  Where did Tracy go  He said he had enough  He walked out  He left us  Yeah  What  Oh he's over there  What happened to Tracy  Why is he outside  Was he laughing hysterical  At white guy cock  Yeah  Probably it  I know  Black guys can get five  On each side of the bag  Interesting underwear  Yeah nice fucking silk 
[01:53:30]  I guess maybe he doesn't want  Jesus Christ  I guess he does want  To get arrested maybe  Maybe that's it  Maybe he's got some things  He's worried about  Separating himself from  Alright Matt  Matt any  What are you going to do  To beat these guys  I'll let my cock do the talking  Right now  Do you think  You could get more than  Five traps  What's your cock going to say  Besides ouch  He's really searching  For the proper skin placement now  That seems to be very important  Now it's all about the numbers 
[01:54:00]  Alright here we go  So you can't just go into this  And snap the trap  Here's Matt  From New York City  Oh there's one  Jesus man  That's got to hurt  You're kidding me  That has got to hurt  Wow  Alright he's going for  Number two Anthony  You want to move that  A little closer  Yeah you can move the trap  Don't be such a goose  That's good  Yeah it's all you  Any technique  Any style  Wow he's stretching that out  Like a full mouthful  Oh I lost the mouse trap  He lost the first mouse trap 
[01:54:30]  That's a tough one  He'll get it back on  That one's got to go back on sir  Yeah please  Alright  Stop cheating  He's going for number one again  Wow  Oh my god  Oh two traps sprung  But  Well that's just barely  Barely hanging from  That kid  He hit his hand  From his sack  It counts  He has a broken hand  He does have a broken hand  Which again shows  Opie the courage  Of the competitors  Here today  Broken hand and all  And that didn't stop him  He's here for Super Bowl  A real trooper  There's number two 
[01:55:00]  There's two again  He got that trap hand  He keeps getting his broken hand  Yeah he's got two on his yam bag  But his finger hurts  When he gets that slammed in there  Figure that  I don't know how this guy is wired  But very good  Like I said earlier  He's got a very good  Hubba Bubba  Shoot Hubba Bubba  Consistency to his yam bag  Which I think will really help him  Get those numbers up  And here goes number three  Matt from New York City  Super Bowl Thursday  He's out of camera range by the way  Yeah I'll have to move that  That's alright  That's alright  There you go 
[01:55:30]  There we go  Alright he's got three hanging  He's got three  Three are hanging from his yam bag  How's it feel Matt?  Feels good  He's digging it  Alright he's going for number four  Number four is  Unbelievable  Loaded and ready to go  It hurts  It hurts  Yeah I don't doubt it  Somebody owned up to it  There you go  It does hurt  Oh there's number four  There's four  He still has some skin left 
[01:56:00]  Good placement  Good strategy  Yeah  You know some people just think  This is about slapping your ball bag  In a mousetrap  And taking the pain Opie  But there is a true strategy here  As to where you're placing  These mousetraps on your yam bag  And I see as he goes for five  Mousetrap number six  Loaded and lined up  And I believe a very optimistic Bill  Is loading up trap number seven  You're insane Bill  You're insane  It ain't gonna happen  Not this year  Matt from New York City  Going for the fifth mousetrap 
[01:56:30]  Hanging in way over  Way over the side  Wow he is really hard  Come on  He's struggling  He's struggling  He's  Oh there he comes  He's moving side to side  He's looking to see if he has room for six Anthony  Room for six  Six would be a new world record  This is something I have never seen before  And I  I  I gotta  You know  It's a moment I want to tell my grandchildren about  Here he goes  It's a moment they would love to tell their grandchildren about  Attempting the world record  He's actually reaching back and pulling asshole skin to the front 
[01:57:00]  Yeah  Here it is  Oh  One two one  Six  Under record  Six  He's going for seven Anthony  He's going for seven  No way  No way  Not seven  And do I see mousetrap number eight waiting on deck  There can't  I  I refuse to believe this is even possible  The only thing that's gonna stop this kid is lack of skin  Right  That's all that's gonna stop him  Lack of skin  The drive  Here we go  Number seven  That's a tough spot he's picking over there  Yeah  I don't 
[01:57:30]  I don't know about this  To the ball  I think he's gonna have to go more for a part of the upper penile skin  And a lower penile skin  Upper yam bag skin  It's still officially nutsack  But it's getting a little  A little too close  He's rifling through these like a janitor looking through his keys  Yeah  Number seven  Oh my god  Wait do we have one that fell  Yes  Oh my god  It's only six  Still only six  I thought we were seeing history in the making  Wow  We still have a world record in front of us  Yes we do  Yes  Oh it snapped on Bill's hand 
[01:58:00]  Alright  Like that really hurts  After watching this  Have you found any open real estate you think?  Matt  He's just concentrating  Matt  Yes  Another problem with this Opie  Is finding the skin  You keep pulling thinner and thinner layers of skin out  Because so much is taken up by the previous traps  Which makes it even more painful  Alright here we go  Number seven  Yeah he's hurting  Stop taking your time Bill  Wait wait get on camera  Because this is for  Yeah here we go  Another world record  Hold on a minute  Stop IMing me you motherfuckers 
[01:58:30]  I can't see the goddamn camera  What are they saying?  This is cool  Wait wait wait wait  Hold on Matt  We're trying to get you on camera  On pal talk camera  There it is  There it is  Okay you're on camera again  He's been moving around like crazy  Anyone IMs me they get banned  Here goes number seven  Somebody hold the back of the trap  Yeah hold the back of the trap  Yeah hold please Bill  Bill it's not gay  Yeah it's not at all  Hold it with your chin  It's not gay  Alright he's going for seven  Seven mouse traps 
[01:59:00]  No  Oh no  I don't think it's going to happen  It ain't happening  He said it's not  Give him one more chance  He got three attempts  Give the kid another chance  I think he got three attempts  Someone's on the phone going  Can you imagine if Ben played this game?  Yeah  He's going for 47  He'll never make it  You know those containers  You see on your way to Jersey  The shipping containers  You need  One of those filled with mouse traps  For Ben  Alright  We're trying 
[01:59:30]  We'll give him one more shot  At seven mouse traps  Yeah we're going to stop at seven  This is the last shot  He's going to get at this  Right at the edge  Right at the edge  Bill just hold the back of the trap  For the guy  So he can set his world record  Bill pull his tag out  But did they tell  You know Bruce Jenner  Not to attempt  The final part of his  Oh  Wait is it official  One fucking fell  Oh one  Another fell  There is only six  It's just a skin issue  But six is the record  Sir  That is more than respectable 
[02:00:00]  Six mousetraps  I'm going to get  From the airbag  Alright  Unbelievable day  Yes  This competition  Let's go to the phones  Larry in New Jersey  Larry  Hey what's up guys  Hey  This is so painful  Why I'm the champion  This is so strange  You're a gentleman  And the worst  The worst part about it is  I can't even like  There's nothing even on  Shitty terrestrial radio  To listen to otherwise  Right  I'm fucking  I have to listen to this pain  While I'm driving to work  With my legs crossed 
[02:00:30]  I'm going to get in an accident  Because I'm going to get my fucking  Put off the brake gear  Alright  Wow  Thank you sir  Jesus Christ  We are up to about  650 people  Alright  That are watching this competition now  You know how it starts out like that  By next year  Superbowl  I'm sure we'll have millions of viewers  Around the world  Millions of viewers  As it is brought to network television  And sponsorships  Yes  The ultimate challenge  Perhaps ESPN  Is still waiting for the boys  Just in case you're tuning in  To Superbowl Thursday  Oh we are far from through 
[02:01:00]  Ladies and gentlemen  We're running out of show though  The mousetrap of just the beginning  Hey  This is Billy Conley  And you're listening to  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Yeah what's next  We're running out of show  We should move right on  Right on to the wax  The wax strips  Wax strips  These are wax strips  Used normally I guess  To a  Bikini wax  Or a  Girls get waxed with  Mustache wax  Ladies  Anything  Alright  For the Italian girls out there  Stop 
[02:01:30]  A lot of them do  Oh my god  Is that sticky  A lot of them do  Is it  Oh my god  Yeah that's gonna hurt  Fuck that  Oh I thought you were  Touching the wax strip  And not Raphael's bag  That is sticky  It looks sticky  Alright Jimmy  Hey did we lose Tracy Morgan  He didn't want to be part of this  He just said  What  He just tapped out  He tapped out  I can't believe it  Tracy Morgan tapped out  Why  Did he get a phone call  He was mortified  Why was he mortified  He's a little too Hollywood  These days I think  He's got people around him  Yeah 
[02:02:00]  He just didn't like  Looking at guys balls  He said he'll come back tomorrow  Do you think we enjoy this  This is for the listeners  That's right  This is for sports  We sacrifice for our fans  Hey Ben who else is here  You watch both  Ari's here  Ari's here  I don't think some people  Take this sport seriously  Yep you're right  They look at it like it's a game  Like it's some kind of a joke  Instead of a true sport  We're going to the celebrity bullpen  By the way  We lost Tracy  We had to take him out of the game  We got Ari coming in  From the Sopranos  Ari  Yeah 
[02:02:30]  I'm kind of scared  To come in this room  Yeah it really is nasty  That is  Something to watch  Does it just reek like  Awful sex in here  It probably does  Yes it does  Smells like a  Ugh  Wait a minute  You're from Dog Sees God  I'm from Dog Sees God  I thought they said  You were from the Sopranos  You were on there  I was also on the Sopranos  What were you on the Sopranos  Back in the day  I was Meadows College roommate  Yeah  I pulled out my hair  Remember the crazy girl  I was crazy  Yeah  That was actually a really good role  Not as crazy as these guys  But you know 
[02:03:00]  Hey yeah  I don't always wear this by the way  It looks very becoming on you  You should wear it all the time  It's not just something I come in with on Thursdays  It looks good  Thank you  It looks really good  Alright so what do you got to do to wax this off  Because we're running out  Okay so basically warm it up in hand  Apply really firm  Right  And I guess they're ripping it off  Yeah  Okay so let's  I think all three of them should do it at the same time  Is it going to be off the balls?  No I think they  No one at a time  Because you want to get the reaction  We need reactions  That's why you're still an intern Bill  That's right  Are you offended by male nudity or anything like that? 
[02:03:30]  I love male nudity  Alright very good  Bring it on  And Tracy Morgan doesn't by the way  And Ari is making it less gay thank God  Yes  We needed a female  Finally a lady is in here  I'm erotic in here  It's a little  Yeah a little  And why add the word erotic  It's just homo  Two men in beekeeper outfits with erections  Do they look ridiculous Ari?  No it's good  It's the look  I got a little beekeeper hat for my head  We're running out of show 
[02:04:00]  I'm telling you  Yeah guys  Now that there's a lady in here  You can't be shy  You're going to have to slap that on there  Lip it out  Yeah come on  Don't be fucking shy  Just do it  Raphael is up first  Here goes Raphael from Connecticut  He was very impressive in the mousetrap challenge Anthony  Wet chicken  NH  You're banned  You're banned  Goodbye  What's he saying?  Bounce that person  IM'd me  Interfears with my camera shot  You're gone  Goodbye  You missed the fun now  I was like what the fuck 
[02:04:30]  Alright guys we're ready  He's got the wax strip on his ball bag  That's got to be tender and sore from the mouse  Oh my god  From the mousetraps  It looks like a fruit roller  Alright the wax strip is on  Look at that come on now  This is going to be child's play I think  For Raphael  Oh that's nothing  Come on bring the glue traps in  I agree  Jesus  Come on bring the glue traps in  What nothing  I gotta do it again now  What the fuck  Alright  Maybe you're not  Do you have hairy balls?  Yeah  Yeah  Very proud of him 
[02:05:00]  I've got hairy sticky balls now  Yeah that's true  After a fucking  Yeah this is nothing after the mousetraps  Which is good  It's kind of  It's sticky so the bees will probably stick to them now  As they try to escape  Alright that ripped a little hair out  Yeah it took a little hair out  Yeah it hurt  This is child's play  I'm disappointed  I'm disappointed  After all the mousetraps  Look at this  How many mousetraps did you fit on there?  He fit four  Four  I didn't strategically place him on my sack  I would like a recount maybe  Ah the excuses come in 
[02:05:30]  He's blaming it on coaching  You know this is something we don't need in professional sport like this  Is the excuses  The blaming  Yeah  The finger pointing  Alright Steve is up next from Connecticut  He's got the wax strip  Steve from Connecticut  He's got some hairy balls  He doesn't care  He's got the head caught  Did they get that on camera?  Oh my god  Oh my god  Ari what do you think? 
[02:06:00]  This is the most horrifying thing I've ever seen on my entire life  That looked like it hurt  Anthony explain that if you can  It's worse than trying to pull Turkish taffy off of flypaper  It stuck to it  It was like an old fruit roll up  You know on a hot summer day  You step on a piece of gum on the sidewalk  Anthony  And you're pulling and pulling  And the gum is still on your shoe  Wrap it in there  Smash it on there real good  Wait here goes Matt  Attempting the wax strip  He's got the back of the shaft in there  Don't bend down or then you're not going to see it on camera 
[02:06:30]  Lift it up from the back to the front  Here we go  Here we go  Yeah here we go  Here we go  Ari  This is for you Ari  No toy the camera  Did you hear the rip?  Did you hear the rip?  Wait wait wait wait  Dude  Hold on  That hurt right?  Oh wow  He made it through  The wax strips  That hurt more than the mousetraps  Matt safe to say? 
[02:07:00]  Yes  Safe to say  Wow unbelievable  Alright all the guys made it through the second stage of Super Bowl Thursday  And remember people at home don't try this  These are professionally trained athletes  That's right  That's right  For minutes to do this  You guys aren't going to make me do anything like this  Well we're hoping Ari  We're hoping  We only have  Hey take off your pants  Let me tell you something Ari  We only have one competition we've ever had the ladies do  We haven't had it done in quite a while  And I really don't think you'd be up to it  It is called the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge 
[02:07:30]  See the Wiffle Ball Bat in that glass case up there  It's protected in the glass case  I don't want to say no more  Alright  All I'll say is  It's a special kind of lady that even tries to compete  I'm sure that's true  Yeah  Yeah  Usually they're strippers  Uh huh  Or some type of porn star  Right  That goes for that  You can see their notches and names  Yeah  At various points on the bat  Which I think you can figure out why  Sounds like a fantastic conversation  They weren't just drawing their names willy nilly on that bat 
[02:08:00]  We want Ari to hang out a little longer  So let's uh  Yes  Now uh  Are we done with the wax strips?

[02:19:30]  Opie and Anthony  The Opie and Anthony show  Alright  I guess we're ready  For the ultimate challenge  I think so  The problem is  We only have two containers  And three people  I understand  They're going to have to share  They shared mousetraps  Yeah you shared mousetraps  It's not gay  Believe me  I think we should  Roll the dice or something  To figure out who goes first  Or something  How about whoever  Yeah  Paper rock scissors  Pulling straws  What  What do you want to do  Smallest cock  I mean 
[02:20:00]  How do you flip a coin  With three people  Who has the edge  I think my belt  Speaks for itself  That I should go last  Alright Matt  That's good  Good point  Matt is the champion  They're both pretty full  What do you want  80 bees or 74  On your balls  Who cares  The only problem is  What problem  I think we should  Open it up  And get the bees  Into the main container  First  Just so  Because this thing's  Hard to open  The safety hatch  And if they're  Doing it that way  Hey hey hey  Here's the problem  With that though  Once the bees  Are in there  If they have a problem 
[02:20:30]  Getting their bag  In there  Before it gets sealed  There's going to be  Some loose bees in here  That's right Bill  It's going to be  Someone's responsibility  To open that gate  That's right  I don't care what it takes  Balls go in first  Gate open second  Absolute good point  That's what happened  At Chernobyl  They open the gate first  And put the balls in second  Now look  We get balls right in there  Yeah  Do you want to just have  Raphael call heads or tails  For who goes first here  Yeah let Raphael do it  Nathaniel  What is it  It's tails 
[02:21:00]  Tails it is  So  Fez  Fez  Fez  From Ron and Fez everyone  I'm very surprised  That you're in the studio  Well I got here  A little early today  Can I say  Finally  Great radio  My god  This is what the country  Has been waiting for  Superbowl  Every single day  Is what I said  Fez we had  Girls coming in here  Doing the wiffle ball bat challenge  Three of them  Were up on the console  Really  Where were you that day 
[02:21:30]  I don't recall  That day  But yeah  I just happened to get in here  Early to do some paperwork  Over some things  With black girl  Just great show guys  This is the best  Why are you pulling up a chair  Fez  Why can't we do this every day  Don't you have show prep  To do or something  Oh  Fuck that show  Alright well  Well I'm glad  You're enjoying it  Yeah this is the best  What's next 
[02:22:00]  What's coming up next here  Well we have the ultimate challenge  This is the grand finale  The apparatus full of bees  The guys will be putting their balls  In that hopefully airtight rubber top  And then a gate will be open  Releasing the bees into the chamber  Yeah  And then they have to sit there  Until one of them gets stung  This was one of many prototypes  We had to figure out an apparatus  This is all Nazi technology  I know  One prototype was Jimmy Norton's mouth  And that didn't work out too well 
[02:22:30]  Yeah I don't want bees  He's afraid of bees  I don't want bees in my mouth  I'm glad we all had a laugh at my expense  There we go  Wow I am now into the frightened portion of the show  I've never had an anxiety attack  I think I'm having one  Yeah this is a little much  I'm getting a little freaked out now  I understand why Tracy left  Yeah see  But you're showing you have more balls than Tracy Morgan  She's not going to be able to handle this  She's going to be fine  She's going to be more balls than Tracy Morgan  Yeah that's true  Alright now how do we decide 
[02:23:00]  Is it who goes first or both at the same time  I think  Shouldn't it be  Both sequential or  Yeah okay  You're going first  Raphael  Raphael  It's up to you bro  You look a little nervous now  Wait how do we get him up higher for the camera  Can he stand on a box  I'm not even kidding  Well the camera  Can the camera be aimed  No cause he's  Cause he's a little shorter  So we wanted to  Oh little fella  We want to make sure we get this on camera  That's all  If I was in better shape 
[02:23:30]  He could stand on my back  Alright  We are adjusting the webcam  That's good  The apparatus filled with  How many bees are in there  Seriously  What do you guess  Yeah a shitload  50  About 50 bees  That's fine  They're not going to bother you  Wait  And we need the camera  Where we see their faces  I think too  Yeah  Raising it back up  We can still proceed here  You don't bother them  They won't bother you  Yeah we need to see their face  I might have to pull out then  Yeah pull out a little  Cause we're getting video as well 
[02:24:00]  For the websites  That will be close ups  And all that crap  We got a two camera shoot happening  Bill did you just say  Whichever way is most comfortable  None  Oh wait  None way  And we need a girl  To blow into the tube  I think they're pretty  Into the phallic tube  I don't think you need to  Yeah I think they're pretty angry  Who's going to put their mouth  By that tube  Here we go  The ultimate challenge  We've been waiting five years  To do this on radio  Five years  We finally found lawyers  We're stupid enough  To let us do this  Gentlemen

[02:41:00]  Damn you hawk  Hopi and Anthony  We all noticed that Anthony was a bit smitten  You guys are just a bit smitten with Johnny Smith from Saw 3  Every emotion I've never seen  He was bashful  Shy  Looking down at the carpet  I was just  It was one of those like  As soon as he went to commercial  He's kind of kicking the ground  Looking down  And trying to talk to her a little more  My god  You're a shock jock 
[02:41:30]  I wasn't  I wanted a picture  And then  It wound up being like  Ten pictures  Yeah  Because they had a professional photographer with them  No that was your photographer  That you brought in for this moment  I didn't bring in a photographer  We don't know who that guy was  It was just intimidating  I've seen her in so many movies and everything  And you know  His voice went all up high  You're so much smaller in real life  I said she  Because I  Ew  No  Did you say that?  He went to commercial 
[02:42:00]  He's looking at her  He's like  We were talking  And  We were talking right here  And  And she  I just said  I go  Babe you are so much tinier than you are  That's not how you said it  No  Now it sounds good  What?  How did I say it?  Now it sounds like the Anthony we all know and love  How did I say it?  Bill Burr will do it  That's how he said  You're like  You're so much tinier than you are  You brought  You brought your shoulders up to your ears  Those little birds  Flying around his neck  You are an ass 
[02:42:30]  We saw this  That's how you did it  We all saw the stress in your shoulders  They went up  You're looking kind of down  Bashful  Shy  He had aw shucks vibe  I don't know how to deal with this  You couldn't even say  Did I really sound like that?  Oh yeah you did  I just feel like I watched you grow up in the movie  Shut up  No Billy's saying it's even worse  Oh it's terrible  Oh god  It's pretty close at  Even during the interview you kept going back to her  No matter what he was talking about  I know  Yeah yeah yeah goodbye goodbye 
[02:43:00]  Shawnee didn't you  How did you get into this?  But he wouldn't really look at her  He just kept looking down at the ground  Yeah Toba was  Like he wasn't worthy  Toba was  Toba started admitting that he has like bodies buried in his backyard  And you're like  Well anyway Shawnee  Do you get nervous?  I didn't ask that  I just thought  What happens when you're on the set?  Oh Jesus Christ  You are  Asses  Anthony was 
[02:43:30]  Smitten  Smitten  Like it's 1880  I just  I'm a fan of hers  Could I get your autograph?  She's very tiny  I didn't ask for her autograph  And she's cute  What do you want me to say?  You should have told her about that  I really admire your work  You should have told her about that hot rod you bought recently  Yes  I didn't bring up my car  Maybe you could go for a malt  You want to see my car?  Shut up 
[02:44:00]  It's really fast  Go to Inspiration Point  And watch the submarine races  You two  You three  All of you  Dude we're all looking around the room like  Wow we haven't seen this side of Anthony  Why?  Hands in his pockets  Shoulders up looking down  Dude  Do you realize you turned beat  Red?  You have no idea  You have no idea obviously  I didn't blush  I don't blush  You've never had rosy cheeks since I've known you  I don't blush  You look like you're in a Christmas special  It was Christmas morning Anthony 
[02:44:30]  I don't blush  I was just  So do you have any more projects coming up?  I was conducting an interview  You're too beautiful to do a McDonald's commercial  I didn't say that either  You might as well have  I'm just a big fan  Anything that you're in I'll go and see it  That was high school Anthony  That was high school shy Anthony 
[02:45:00]  Oh Jesus  That was not radio star Anthony  That was high school Anthony  Shawnee do you have a fan site?  Maybe I can run your fan site for you?  I didn't ask that either  Her bodyguards taking pictures of him  Because they know he's going to be a stalker  Right yeah you're on file now bro  It's on file  My car is blue because I heard you like blue  It's red  Oh  Like my cheeks  You could not tell her the contest was called Fatty Pig Fatty  Well they had just come in  And I didn't know what their vibe was  You're in saw three  I didn't know if they would be offended by this 
[02:45:30]  There was no they  You were worried that your girlfriend was going to be  I have a girlfriend and she is home  Her name is Shawnee  No  Might as well be  Oh coming up  They're going to be on the CW11 news  You're probably going to tape it and watch it ten times tonight  Yeah  You better hurry up and end the radio show  So Anthony can watch her on another show  Would you stop it already? 
[02:46:00]  I'm just a fan  Bill Burr picked up on you  You were looking at the floor  Bill Burr will do anything he can to throw me under the bus  And he's kind of kicking the ground a little bit  Like I don't know  I was thinking  I thought it was nice  It was sweet  To finally see this man giving in to  Love and emotions that he never shows  Well when you said  What did you say  I don't want to mess it up  As soon as we went to commercial  You looked at her and said  And you thought none of us were listening  I said  Had your parents died 
[02:46:30]  No  No I said  You're so tiny  You're so much smaller than you are in the movie  You know how you said tiny though  You went  You're so tiny  Well how are you supposed to say  You're so tiny  No you said  You're so tiny  You're so much smaller than you are  Yeah small broad  It was just how your voice changed  Hey dame  You're so much tinier  Well you expected  To be 35 feet tall  Like she is in the movie theater  No but she comes off  Looking a lot bigger  On screen  Jimmy is right 
[02:47:00]  We saw high school Anthony  That was high school Anthony  That was  That's what makes Anthony  Do the brilliant impressions  That was the shy  That was  Anthony's so funny  And so good impressions  Because he wanted girls to like him  And he was shy in high school  You are killing me here  You would ever want to go out with me  You are killing me here  Just a lug  He would just be making her laugh all night  Because he would want her to stay  And stay interested  I understand what it's like  Holy Jesus  Are you hammering me  The second she would start laughing  He would actually screw up the impression 
[02:47:30]  Because he would be so excited  You got all this worked out  Don't you Bill  I saw it man  I saw it  We saw it  He wants to go on a date  With her like the original karate kid  He wants his mom  To pick her up  In the station wagon  And drop them both off  And put it fair  What?  And they call me  Puppy love  Shut up  This is not puppy love  Are you going to give her 
[02:48:00]  Your varsity sweater?  What year is this?  Can I get another photo?

[03:26:30]  That's right  You were shy Anthony handing her a wooden S  That you had shellacked  Shawnee  You were shellacking  What you wanna do  I think I'm in love with you  All right we got another clip  For a while  Ann explains Fatty Pig Fatty to Shawnee  I thought you guys were you know like  It's $10 a pound contest  I'm feeling very  No wait wait wait  Anthony tell Shawnee what the name of the contest is 
[03:27:00]  It's the $10  Mr. Nice Guy  It's the $10 pound contest  Go ahead  It's the $10 pound contest  Come on I want Anthony to say it  He's all frozen right  I can't say it  Shawnee he'll listen to you  Go Anthony  We have to look at it though  Go Anthony what's the name of the contest  Anthony look me in the eyes  And say the name  It's called the Fatty Pig Fatty contest  You should be ashamed  I know  I'm gonna call your mother  Fatty Pig Fatty  That clip says a lot man 
[03:27:30]  It sure does  That's just the fact that  They had just come in  And I didn't wanna  Alienate  Look me in the eye  I didn't wanna alienate the guests  If perhaps  Any of them have some  Fat people in their family  Or close friends  So I didn't wanna alienate them  That's a very considerate thought  I'm very considerate  I am considerate  You don't consider the families of eight patients  You know that we've been talking about this for an hour 
[03:28:00]  Just about an hour  Only an hour?  It seems like fucking five to me  They left around 8.30, 8.35  Scott in Oklahoma  What's up?

[03:28:30]  We don't need  There's no need  They're very busy  They're very busy  Oh and look  They're finding pictures of Shawnee for you  Would you stop?  He's adorable  He already has all of those  Take to his wall  How pretty is she?  Your guys are jackasses  I bet Anthony has like a shed or something in the back  No one else is allowed in  I don't have a shed  And let's all be honest here  We're very surprised 
[03:29:00]  Because she's twice the age of your normal  You know  Crush  Well she looks very good  What 15?  I think she's like 36 or so  Is she?  I don't know  Born in 1970  Somewhere around there  I do believe  Think I saw on the bio  Yeah  That everybody got  Please  I wouldn't have remembered that  That's all of it  1970  She just turned 36 in July  She looks great  All right  Of course she does  Was she the girl you used to think about 
[03:29:30]  When you were installing air conditioners?  Would you stop it?  Hotline's ringing  Hotline's ringing  Please  Please  I am not  Uh oh  What is this?  Hello?  Hello  Hello?

Good Adam  We're trying to find Shawnee Smith  I know  I'm trying to get her for you guys  Um  Can I talk to Roland for a second?  Sure  I'm gonna put you back on hold 
[03:30:00]  Basically um  Anthony has a crush on her  I'm sorry  And if you want promotion for Saw 3  That would be great  If you could call our show  Hold on a minute  Why?  No  He just wants to  He probably wants to know  Like look um  Shawnee isn't comfortable  Is he  Is he the guy  That was sitting closest to her?
