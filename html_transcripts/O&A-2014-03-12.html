<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of a Dollar Shave Club gift box containing, among other items, "One Wipe Charlies" and an Ironwood candle, sparking a debate on crossword puzzles versus cryptograms and Sudoku.  The hosts then transitioned to a comparison of radio and podcasts, mentioning their experiences with successful podcasters like Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Joe Rogan, and Kevin Smith, while expressing frustration with SiriusXM's lack of investment in their show's video capabilities.  They praised the production quality of the "My Wife Hates Me" podcast taping they attended, featuring Rich and Bonnie and guest Ron Bennington, further fueling their discussion on the perceived decline of satellite radio and the rise of podcasts.  The conversation then shifted to the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, with listener calls contributing to various speculative theories ranging from rapid decompression to pilot suicide and mechanical failure.  The hosts also covered President Obama's surprise Gap store visit in Times Square, discussing the ensuing traffic and minimum wage implications.  The segment continued with more listener calls, speculation on MH370, including a possible connection to a book about a stolen 727, and a discussion of modern CGI technology.  They briefly mentioned Zach Galifianakis' interview with President Obama on "Between Two Ferns."

The next segment began with a call from a listener named Bobo, discussing a tumultuous but lasting relationship and promoting his birthday party.  The hosts then discussed Bernard Hopkins' upcoming boxing match and the dangers of repeated head trauma in boxing.  They reviewed the Zach Galifianakis/President Obama Funny or Die interview, expressing differing opinions on its comedic merit.  Bernard Hopkins then appeared as a guest, promoting his fight, discussing brain injuries in boxing, his Senate testimony on the issue, his career, and even a past encounter with President Obama. The hosts frequently used profanity and engaged in off-color discussions throughout the segment.

The following segment featured Bernard Hopkins again, promoting his fight and discussing the rise of MMA and its impact on boxing. After Hopkins left, the hosts discussed their podcast, "Snooping Kids," which involved children finding embarrassing items (described with explicit language, including "fuck toys" and "dildos") in their parents' belongings.  They briefly touched upon the band Boston and new music releases. They then dissected a Fox News critique of the Obama/Galifianakis interview, using explicit language in their commentary, before transitioning to criticisms of the economy and Bill O'Reilly.  A significant portion of this segment focused on a heated argument between staff members Sal and Denny, stemming from Sal's tweet about Denny taking a coworker's crab cake.  The hosts played audio of the argument, which included insults and accusations, with other staff members – Eric, Roland, and Iraq – joining the discussion.  The segment ended with the hosts attempting, unsuccessfully, to resolve the conflict.

A subsequent segment delved deeper into workplace disputes involving Denny, including incidents such as his request for a NutriBullet and his angry reaction to receiving a used razor handle from Sal, a prank where he opened E-Rock's mail, and the conflict over Heather B.'s crab cakes.  The hosts humorously described Denny's appearance and behavior, and ribbed Sal for his actions.  Heather B. called in, bringing vodka and discussing Friday office parties, including the presence of strippers.  The hosts mentioned their upcoming trip to South by Southwest, funded by Sway.  The segment included a story about an intern, Sal, reporting another intern, Kenny, for mistreating other interns, resulting in Kenny calling Sal a "cheese eater."  They also discussed a TMZ report about Jim Brewer's ex-neighbor facing felony stalking charges.  The segment concluded with a clip of Chelsea Handler's interview with Piers Morgan and a discussion of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, followed by a breaking news report of a building explosion and partial collapse in Harlem.

The final segment mentioned was extremely brief, featuring only a short exchange between the hosts and Roland, who held a microphone but did not speak.  The excerpt ended with a standard closing announcement mentioning a post-show recap.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning everyone. Off and running.  I want to thank Dollar Shave Club for the gift bag.  I thought it was the razors.  I guess I said gift bag, it's a gift box.  A box.  I don't know, I guess they're doing something for colon cancer month.  Is it colon cancer month?  Colonoscopies.  What the hell is that about?  I didn't read the note.  Oh, maybe it should be the note. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know.  I do like Dollar Shave Club. I'm a big fan.  Yeah.  And they like to put together these gift boxes.  Yeah.  And they got a product called One Wipe Charlie's.  Oh.  And I laughed at Anthony and I said, One Wipe Charlie's?  That's just a good start.  It's a good start, One Wipe.  You can get it all done with One Wipe.  No.  It's the baby wipes, you know.  Yeah.  They used to be just called baby wipes, but then they discovered weight.  Adults could use these things, but they don't want to, like, wipe their ass with a baby wipe, 
[00:01:00]  so they come up with names like One Wipe Charlie's and such.  Probably just some guy after a fucking heavy night at Guinness and stuff,  and then he takes a dump and realizes, like, oh, shit, there's no toilet paper here.  Oh, and he reaches for the baby wipes, like, I've got to use these, and then goes, ooh, nice.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's a whole market now for adults.  I think we're on to something here, yeah.  But to say, One Wipe, get out of here.  I have those in my bed.  You've got to be kidding me.  I carry those with me to the gym and everything. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, they're awesome.  They're great.  They're absolutely great.  Good for a little midday touch-up?  Yeah.  Sure.  I like a good deep cleaning.  No, no, I have to if I use the toilet.  Yeah.  The civilized way to wipe includes 40 wipes, so that's good for 40 bathroom runs?  No way.  That's good for maybe four.  I'm not even joking.  Well, the best way is to just use your standard toilet paper and then finish up with one of those.  Finish up all nice.  Finish up all nice. 
[00:02:00]  And it's got the aloe in it.  It's got aloe in it.  It's got the aloe.  Aloe in it.  And then also in the gift box, they have the ironwood candle.  And that's...  I like a good candle.  Are you into a good candle every once in a while?  A little aromatherapy to relax you while you're getting that big pipe up.  Yes.  Can we light this in here?  Oh, boy.  Smoke detectors go off.  Fire.  A good candle.  Yeah, I think a candle's okay.  What's the scent?  It's... 
[00:02:30]  I don't know.  Hold on, I'll tell you.  It's like spy-ish.  Oh, this is called rain.  Smells nice.  I like a good candle.  Ironwood candle.  You should put it in the middle of the console and give it a light for a little mood in here.  Absolutely.  Dim the lights.  A couple of men just talking.  Right.  I ain't wasting my candle on you guys.  Come on.  You guys dim the lights.  I'll do a little man-to-man measuring.  A little massage.  So I'll say, so far, so good.  So far, so good.  But then, you know, then they're getting a little wacky. 
[00:03:00]  They got to get a little goofy.  I think this is for a colonoscopy, I think.  So, like, the candle relaxes you.  Uh-huh.  The one-wipe Charlie's makes sure the entranceway is all ready to go.  All nice.  And then they put in the best of Sade.  A little Sade?  Is it Sade?  CD.  You know, that bra that sang Smooth Operator?  Yeah.  Smooth Operator!  So I guess that gets you in the mood, just chilling you out? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, that's supposed to, like, relax you, I guess.  Relax the bunghole.  And then...  Yeah.  One hundred years.  One hundred crosswords.  Celebrating the crossword's centennial.  Oh, so you got a hundred crossword puzzles in there?  Yeah.  Do you like a good crossword puzzle?  I cannot stand a crossword puzzle.  Home six down.  Yeah, but we make all the crossword puzzles now.  Yeah.  We've made a lot of clues in crossword puzzles. 
[00:04:00]  They were very happy with the fact that they didn't have to reference Ron Howard anymore when they needed an Opie.  It's Blank and Anthony.  Right.  And it's, uh, we've made the New York Times crossword puzzle in many of them.  Oh, yeah.  But I'm like you.  I don't like crossword puzzles whatsoever.  No.  I was always big on a nice crypto quote.  Oh, really?  A cryptogram.  I do like looking at a bunch of random letters and then figuring out what the hell they're saying. 
[00:04:30]  That's kind of fun.  I'll just do the Sudoku.  That's about it.  That's the only thing I'm into these days.  But they're easy.  They're, like, really quick and whatever.  But there you go.  Well, thank you, Dollar Shave Club.  That's very nice of them.  One thing is missing from the gift box, Sam Roberts.  What?  The envelope.  The envelope.  They don't need to give you an envelope because you just did that whole thing just now.  I understand.  But I'm assuming now the envelope will arrive.  I think the envelope goes to other people down the hall. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  We could take a little off the top.  A little skim?  Yeah.  A little taste for the boys.  What?  What do you got for breakfast over there?  What are you talking about?  Well, I mean, what do you hear?  I'm hiding my health shake so I don't discuss it anymore.  You won't even discuss the health shake?  No.  It's over there and I'll be drinking it later.  Usually it's front and center.  Tough customer.  We used to have such fun with that.  Well, yeah.  I don't know if I would consider it fun.  The definitions of fun are a lot different.  There's some almond milk in there today. 
[00:05:30]  Some almond milk.  Does that do the same thing that regular, like milk goes...  I think so.  Gets a little phlegmy?  Yeah.  I think it's not really milk.  They just call it milk.  It's not coming from a cow or anything, I don't think.  Oh, no.  Then I got some raspberries in there, some blueberries.  I said no vegetables today.  Oh.  A bignana and oatmeal.  That bignana does do wonders to everything.  Right.  Everything it's thrown in is just marvelous. 
[00:06:00]  I love a good banana.  Yeah.  I went to the Riotcast podcast last night.  Oh.  It is so frustrating.  Yeah.  To see what was going on last night.  Yeah.  I don't understand why satellite radio is allowing podcasts  to pass them by.  But it is so obvious that that's what's happening out there.  Yeah.  It was the Rich and Bonnie podcast, My Wife Hates Me.  Mm-hmm.  It was at the Village...  Underground. 
[00:06:30]  Underground.  It was Gnomes Club.  And it's a beautiful place down there in the village  near the comedy cellar.  And the stage is set up beautifully with some lighting.  They have their logo on the sides and nice comfy chairs and a big, big, huge...  Oh, yeah.  I tweeted a picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And look, there's Big A at the bottom of my picture, getting a big head in my picture.  Look how nice that looks, the stage.  Yeah.  Set up nicely. 
[00:07:00]  And then Dan Soto did about 10, 15 minutes of stand-up and he killed it.  And then Rich comes out and does about 10 minutes of stand-up.  He killed it.  Then Bonnie, same thing.  And then they start their podcast.  Mm-hmm.  All nice.  And then Ron Bennington came out.  He was like the guest marriage counselor.  And they put together a really, really nice show.  Yeah.  Really nice.  And we come in here and it's 1998.  These microphones. 
[00:07:30]  It's just regular radio.  Tom Papa does.  We do those come to Papa's from there.  That's what we do in the village underground.  Yeah.  And they're set up well for performing and recording.  Yeah.  And they just, they have it kind of down now.  And Bobby's done these before and they always go great.  Yeah.  And Bobby's produced it perfectly.  Yeah.  He's an ass, but man, he really knows this stuff well.  Bobby's great with podcasts and putting that shit together.  Yeah.  Nice, nice music cues and everything.  It was just tight.  It was like boom, boom, boom.  It's a podcast. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  The place was packed.  Everyone's laughing their asses off.  And it was, it was just a lot of fun, but frustrating, you know, when you think about  what, what this could have been.  I don't believe it could be anything anymore, to be honest with you.  I really don't.  You know, I think, uh, I think the radio show's fine.  We do a very good job every day, but I don't really believe that, that anything spectacular  is going to happen with, uh, Sirius XM moving forward.  It is what it is.  And I guess they'll just ride it out until, until probably podcasts just destroy this place. 
[00:08:30]  They're kind of two different animals at this point.  You know, they kind of went, each went their separate way.  This is more of that, Hey, we're driving somewhere, let's tune in and, and listen to current news  and things like that.  And a podcast is more of a, you could listen at any time during the week before it gets  a little dated.  It's, it's more for, you know, you're hanging out, you're, you're listening through your  own thing.  Are you going to be like Todd?  What do you mean?  They can't do what we do. 
[00:09:00]  No, no, I'm just saying it's a different.  We're local and live.  No, I'm just saying it does seem like it, like, like it's forked off into two different  areas.  But I think that's going to be the next stage of podcasts where they figure out where they  go, you know, right more, uh, to a live type of thing.  Yeah.  Once you can distribute it like that.  Eric Logan warned me many years ago.  This was before the first podcast really hit.  He goes, podcasts are the future.  You guys should embrace them.  And what we did at the time was we embraced the podcast. 
[00:09:30]  And this goes back to my point yesterday that we don't truly, uh, run our channel.  You know, we, we, we can make some decisions here and there.  Sure.  But not, not big, big decisions.  And we got all our pals in the early days to get their, you know, their podcasts on our  channel.  Yeah.  And then they started dropping off cause, cause, cause the company didn't want to pay them.  They didn't want to pay someone like Bill Burr.  Yeah.  Who's now a huge star out there around the world.  Cause Bill finally said, I ain't doing it for free anymore, dude. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I need to get paid.  And I'm fucking stupid.  And I understood him.  I'm like, of course you want to be paid.  He goes, my days of doing stuff for free to get, you know, promotion is over.  I don't need to do that anymore.  Yeah.  You know, at the time Patrice O'Neill was coming in, we were, we were paying him, but  then we didn't have really a lot of money for him anymore.  I remember that.  Who else did we lose over the years?  Well, we still doing anything with Rogan's.  Yeah.  Rogan.  And we, Kevin Smith's they didn't do because I think they wanted, they were a little too, 
[00:10:30]  the lawyers get too territorial about content.  Right.  And so a guy like Kevin Smith is not going to let you own his content.  No.  What do you, like, do you own the music you play?  Right.  What is it about live talk that they think that we're just these fucking shitheads that  they can.  They just want to own it.  Yeah.  It's like the lawyers have to realize you don't own.  We want to own clerks now.  Yeah.  It doesn't work that way.  They, they don't want to pay anyone and then they want to own their content.  That's just not fair or right.  It's just not right.  Way of thinking.  It's just not right. 
[00:11:00]  You can't, I believe like, uh, let's, let's use Dr. Steve as an example.  The guy makes, I think about 150 bucks a week.  Righteous bucks.  That is nothing.  It costs him more money to do the podcast every week because he has to pay guys and  he's got equipment and this and that.  And then on top of it, they own his name.  Like, that's just not right or fair.  Not at all.  Well.  Yeah.  It's one of those things where it's just like, I like doing the radio show.  Like Rogan has of all the ones, I think as far as what I would like, Rogan is the closest 
[00:11:30]  in that he does a three hour show.  Right.  And it goes live on used.  So like, you can listen to my fucking Twitter when I did Joe's show blows up.  Mine did too, man.  But then it blows up again.  The second time when it actually goes up even more people, but you can do a live, have call  ins.  Like, that's what I like.  I like the live knowing that people are listening right now.  This is all stuff we just, you know, wanted for here and we just can't get it done.  Just a dumb camera in studio that supposedly, cause now I'll hear about this, you know, supposedly 
[00:12:00]  they're working on the, you know, the video element again and no offense to the guys down  the hall.  We've heard it for so many years.  I don't believe it until I see it.  See my little monitor that I got for the phones?  All right.  That's nice.  You have a little monitor.  That's true.  That's good.  So, you know, and we don't even have a, we officially don't even have a budget for the  show anymore.  So, you know, do we have a budgie?  A little bird?  That'd be nice.  Let's get a budgie.  But to see, it's a little, it's a little parakeet. 
[00:12:30]  I assume you should have a little bird after.  I hate it.  But to see, to see that last night was a bit, a bit frustrating.  It was really, really well done.  I'm not sure when the, when the podcast will go live.  Did Bobby produce it?  Yeah.  The one they did last night.  I'm not sure when it'll be available, but I certainly recommend everyone check it out  because it was really solid.  I hope they leave the stand-up, the stand-up on, on the podcast.  I'm not sure if they will.  All right.  Probably not. 
[00:13:00]  No?  I bet they don't want to.  You don't want to burn that out there, yeah.  Yeah, but if it's like Dan Soder and he knows he's going to be, you know, recording,  he might just use some stuff he doesn't, you know, care too much about.  That's why, like, the Patrice benefit that went down recently.  So many people came up with a great idea.  Yeah, why don't you guys, you know, put that out on CD or DVD or a podcast?  And the reason is because these guys don't want to, you know, burn out their material.  They have their material that they need to work for at least a year to make real money 
[00:13:30]  out there.  Yeah.  And that's why you don't get to, you know, see those things on CD and DVD.  And it's not, it's not comics being, like, I almost understood, like, people give Dane a  lot of shit at that benefit where he didn't let his stuff get streamed.  It was sort of, I think he probably should have just done older material and let that  get streamed because it's not like music.  Like, once people hear the joke, it just won't, yeah, and it's like, it's really hard.  Believe me, I wish we could do what musicians do and just kind of, yeah, use your same shit, 
[00:14:00]  mix and match.  Yeah.  You know, I'm experiencing erection difficulties and the crowd would like, you know, you bought  her a treadmill.  I love that one.  Yeah.  It doesn't work that way.  It's my favorite.  It just gets it uncomfortable.  Yeah.  From the audience.  Oh, right.  But that's the reason why that stuff doesn't go down.  These guys really need to protect their material.  Yeah, because you can't, it's just an impossibility to create enough good stuff constantly to always  have it burned like that.  When you burn it, like, on TV, like, I think Rodney would do, that's why Leonard doesn't 
[00:14:30]  do specials, he said, because then it's burned.  Right.  You can't do it.  And I think Rodney would, had writers because he would do so much Tonight Shows and so much  shit that once it was burned, you want to do something else.  Although, if you're a comedy fan, you don't mind hearing jokes you've already heard.  Yeah, but the laugh isn't the same.  No.  You feel it, but it's like that, you know, like that laugh you have when you hear something  for the first time.  For the first time, right?  Fuck.  Unexpected.  Yeah.  It's, by surprise, comes out of left field kind of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, anyway, it was great. 
[00:15:00]  Good job to Bob Kelly and everybody else down there.  Well, what, um, yeah, it was, uh, it was a good night.  I started watching, uh, Boardwalk, finally.  Boardwalk Empire, finally.  Really?  Yeah.  Pretty goddamn good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not that I'm, you know, breaking any new ground here.  Was it fucking five years old?  Still, it's...  How many seasons?  Are there four?  I think they just finished season four.  Four?  I'll just say season four ended, and there's a couple things that happened that I loved. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah?  Loved it, yeah.  I'm, uh, yeah, I like it.  I finished up House of Cards, and it opened up that, like, all right, need a new show.  Yeah.  Need another show.  So, I put that.  It's, uh, some familiar faces in there from, like, The Sopranos and The Wire and, uh...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Pretty cool.  You're like, oh, that guy.  Michael K. Williams is, uh, chalky.  Yeah, yeah.  Chalky.  I know the first season was a little slow, though.  A lot of character development and shit like that.  Yeah.  I heard it really picks up after that. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I'm only a few episodes in, too, but I like it.  It looks great.  Michael Shannon?  Uh...  That we had him in.  Oh, yeah, that we had on.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh...  It's...  It looks amazing.  Yeah.  The show looks great.  Uh...  It's huge.  It's, like, big production.  I like that.  You know, I like when a TV series, even though it's, you know, HBO looks like a fucking movie.  Yeah.  A lot of that's green screen, too.  Like, a lot of the, uh, the boardwalk scenes.  Exterior boardwalk scenes.  I saw that on, uh, online.  There's a whole YouTube thing dedicated to, uh, some of these, what they're doing with CGI, 
[00:16:30]  um, on some of these shots.  And it's, it's amazing.  It looks like the old fucking boardwalk.  They're not gonna, like, uh, have movie shoots.  Yeah.  Eventually.  Why would you?  The good thing is they combine the two also.  They do an exterior shot.  Right.  And it's outside, so it's not just the actors in front of a green screen.  They could be on a boardwalk with some sets, and then they just build on top of it.  And they just add stuff.  Right.  So it takes away that actor in front of the green screen kind of weird look. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  But it just adds this huge element to it.  Well, you saw the videos for, uh, Wolf of Wall Street, right?  Yeah, Wolf of Wall Street was another one.  Just amazing.  I think it's on YouTube.  They show how they built these scenes.  built these scenes out of, like, you know, they'll just take a house, a beach, a beach  house, and turn it into a giant complex.  Oh, they do that instead of, instead of just releasing a house, that's, wow.  And then they, did they erase the houses or add houses around them?  I forgot.  They erased it to make it, uh, look like.  Yeah, it's a really cool video. 
[00:17:30]  We could put it on our Facebook page.  It's on Vimeo, actually.  Yeah.  You can't really.  Yeah, I didn't know they did that.  I didn't know.  Oh, my God, yeah.  There was so much, yeah.  The boat scene, he wasn't even on a boat the whole time.  Look, this, it's amazing.  A Hampton's house, right?  Oh, I see.  A little flyover with the pool, and then they still added in so many trees.  And this is exactly, this is what the house actually looked like.  No, they take the trees out.  It's amazing what they can do.  And they built all this.  They built just houses around the big mansion. 
[00:18:00]  They just dropped shit right in.  And that's it.  I had no idea that they did that.  Like, a lion walking through the office.  That looks real.  But there's the guy with the trainer, and then they erased the trainer.  They take him out and add in people, and it looks like he's.  Wow, I guess they had the green screen of a lion, and because the potential for a lion biting  from the handle.  Yeah, that could be a little rough.  It is a cool video, though.  Check it out on our Facebook page.  We're putting it up there right now.  A lot of people have seen this before. 
[00:18:30]  Picture 20 years from now when there's literally, when video is no longer considered proof, because  everything is so real-looking.  So real-looking and, yeah, fake.  And they can do, like, those live 3D things on stage now.  Wait till they can, like, capture De Niro or Pacino or whatever new actor they have.  In every single angle, they can literally make movies without using the actor.  That will eventually happen.  There's a Dove chocolate commercial, chocolate bar commercial, that's out right now, and it  uses an old actress. 
[00:19:00]  What the fuck's her name?  Audrey Hepburn?  Audrey Hepburn.  They completely CGI'd her, like her face.  It's completely, like, they had photos of her from every angle from the old days, I gather,  and just built.  So this is what Jimmy's talking about.  And this is her.  And you can tell, something looks a little off.  Right.  But it's done very well.  She's in a bus.  And it's only going to get better.  Yeah.  It's just not there yet, yeah.  And it's, like, that's...  Is that her?  Yeah.  But that's all fake. 
[00:19:30]  She was hot.  Yeah, she was a cutie.  It doesn't seem off.  Let me see.  Wow, yeah, it's just...  And then a guy in a car.  Audrey Hepburn.  Okay.  It's...  Wow, she was fucking hot.  It's fucking fake.  Big eyebrows.  Yeah.  Boyish hairdo.  She was quite delightful, though.  She is delightful.  Isn't it scenes from movies, though, or no?  No, from what I read about this, they just fucking CGI'd her face.  Wow. 
[00:20:00]  Seriously?  Yeah.  Look at her, a little blinky.  She's got them dull eyes.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's well done.  Isn't it?  That is creepy.  That's...  It's like a scene in Italy or something, and she's in the back of a convertible.  That is really well done.  Pretty cool.  Fuck, man.  But they'll be doing shit like that.  Wow.  Yeah.  What did she die of, Audrey Hepburn?  She's dead, right?  Yeah.  Old fucking age.  Was it that it?  It was...  I don't know.  What did Audrey Hepburn drop dead of? 
[00:20:30]  Wow, she was...  Probably some kind of...  Oh, my God.  I didn't realize how attractive she was.  Probably some kind of cancer.  Yeah, old people stuff gets just shitty.  Old people stuff.  Wow.  Cancer.  Old people stuff.  Cancer?  The big casino?  Epidexial appendix cancer.  What year?  Can't you just take it out?  You're supposed to take the appendix out.  I'm sure they thought of that.  93.  93?  How old was she?  63.  63?  She'd only do that.  63?  Fuck.  She'd be, what, 84, 85 now?  So she's born in 33.  We're 1930. 
[00:21:00]  So those films are probably like in the 50s when she was in her 20s.  All right.  Wow, she was very pretty.  Breaking news.  Audrey Hepburn was attractive.  Good one, Jim.  Yeah.  I mean, who says podcasts are passing us by?  I fire out the fresh information.  What are you going to do?  You just hope something drastic happens around here that changes the game.  I'm just thinking how I can get myself and Audrey Hepburn.  How can I get the rights to her image where I can have that little doe mouth open? 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  And have my wiener shoved into it.  I tweedle my nipples and she looks up and blinks her doe eyes.  Tweedle.  Blink.  Blink.  Anyway.  Next.  Looks like we're looking at a ghost plane, huh?  I don't know what's going on with that goddamn thing.  I think what it is.  It's hooked some fucking turn.  The Malaysian air crash.  Airplane crash.  That thing was a ghost plane now.  It's so funny.  It was breaking news yesterday during the day that the plane, they were searching in the 
[00:22:00]  wrong area, that the plane actually made a pretty much, uh, came, a sharp left turn, like 360  degrees, basically, and started going back the way it came from.  That's a 180.  Right.  360 would be the same direction.  I gotta tell you.  I'm a little slow today.  And I didn't party or anything.  Just going out and then going home.  I can't fall to sleep.  I just tossed in.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  What?  What, did I have too much excitement? 
[00:22:30]  Too much excitement.  Is that what it is?  Your little heart was pumping.  You're a bugger idea.  I'm all excited.  I don't go, yeah, I don't go out much during the week, and I don't really drink or anything.  I had two beers, and I was just like, ugh.  What time did you finish?  I was home by, uh, 11 at the latest, and went right to bed and just tossed and turned all  night.  Your little feety pajamas were all kicking, all happy.  Just excitement.  I don't know what it is.  Excitement.  It's so stupid.  I just went out.  Why am I so excited that I can't rest my brain and my body and get some sleep? 
[00:23:00]  It's dumb.  If I'm watching TV in bed, which I usually am, and then I decide to just flip my head  over to look the opposite way of the TV, like a fucking light switch.  How?  Bam!  Out!  And then you sleep with the TV on all night.  I cannot do that.  Wake up, like, in the middle of the night, like, groggy, do some bad infomercial, and  then I'll just nod back out.  How can you do that, man?  I don't know.  Oh, it's the best.  I love sleep.  I need complete darkness, complete silence. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Are you a light sleeper after you go to sleep?  Like, if somebody comes in the room, are you going to wake up?  Well, I've brought it up over the years.  I'm an extremely light sleeper, which frustrates everyone around me because my mom used to,  like, check to see if we were breathing.  And you would wake up in the middle of the night to see your own mom inches from your  face.  Yeah.  Wow, that's creepy, yeah.  She always, she was always checking on us.  Yeah.  So I guess that's the reason. 
[00:24:00]  If my wife puts the keys in the door and I'm napping, I will wake up.  Oh, see, that's fucking funny.  And she knows, too.  So she tries to be really quiet.  I've been crapped out on the couch and had construction fucking going on in my house.  I've seen it.  I just, blah.  You've done it during radio shows.  Yes, I fell asleep during the show.  How is he sleeping?  It's great.  I sleep better now because I don't drink as much coffee.  The coffee was a, that was evil as far as getting a good night's sleep. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  If you drink coffee past 9 a.m., it messes up your sleep cycle.  Past 9?  That's so stupid.  It does sound cool.  A little bit of an exaggeration, but I mean, if you have, like, an early afternoon cup of coffee,  yeah.  Yeah.  But, no, I sleep pretty good these days, but for whatever reason, toss and turn last night.  So, yeah, 180 degree turn.  Yeah.  With this airplane.  And they said it was 350 miles off course.  Yee.  And then, obviously, it crashed.  You think it crashed into that island, that little island they're searching around? 
[00:25:00]  Hmm.  Yeah, it could have been anywhere, right?  And it's still in the water?  No, there would have been a fire or something.  They would have seen smoke.  It was only a few hours later they started looking.  What was Flight 370's route, they're asking.  Everyone's just trying to figure this out.  So, now they're in the right body of water trying to find something.  So, you think maybe they had rapid decompression and then everyone just fucking passed out?  They said the path was on such an extreme straight line that that is very, very suspicious. 
[00:25:30]  They said if the pilots were still awake or whatever the hell, they wouldn't have been that straight of a line.  So, they're starting to lean toward pretty much a ghost plane where everyone was dead or unconscious.  Giant plane.  And that plane was just through the night.  Until it just runs out of gas or whatever, yeah.  Or, like, just the autopilot clicks off.  But, yeah, it wouldn't have run out of gas because it was an hour into a long flight. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  And why would the autopilot just click off?  Yeah, it wouldn't.  Unless the...  Maybe it was just slowly going down.  Maybe that's it, right?  Oh, man.  Or maybe there was no autopilot on.  So, maybe it took 350 miles to descend, like...  Well, if it's flying that straight, it just shows that there was probably an autopilot on.  Or someone in control of it.  But they don't think someone's in control just because of how straight the flight path was. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And then if you decompress rapidly, but it's not enough to bust the plane apart...  Yeah.  ...the oxygen masks do come down.  Like, I can't imagine everybody didn't put their masks on.  Well, maybe just the two guys that need to didn't.  Maybe everybody in the back did.  Right.  Oh, shit.  They're all just like, hey, I hope they're okay up there.  Oh, boy.  They just fucking crashed down.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty bad.  I say they find something today.  Yeah?  Yeah, they'll find something floating around.  You think today?  I think so.  So, let's go to Buzzard in good old Boston. 
[00:27:00]  Buzzard.  Oh, hey, Jimmy.  I fucking love you guys.  Of course you do.  That fucking plane that crashed had a cracked wing on a TAMAC like a year ago.  Yeah, but didn't they just fix that or something?  On the TAMAC.  Well, I think it was the slanted wing that got nipped.  Hey, hey, hey, easy.  I hear you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Punch it out.  Ha, ha, ha, punch it out.  Wow, I wonder if... 
[00:27:30]  No, but it wouldn't have flown straight if there was a crack in the wing.  That had nothing to do with it because it would have...  That's the mystery of it.  I mean, if it was a cracked wing or it came apart or something, there wouldn't be this mystery.  The fucking odd thing about this is the fact that it turned, flew straight for 350 miles,  drops off a radar, no transponder.  Like, there's all these things in there that just lead to a bunch of options.  It could be pilot suicide still.  It could be, you know, that everybody on the plane instantly lost consciousness. 
[00:28:00]  It's so weird.  It's just a weird fucking turn of events with this thing.  From that height, too, man.  They do know it's just veered wildly off course, so...  They don't think it's terrorism at this point.  Yeah.  You know...  They're leaning away from that anyway.  How...  350 miles...  How long did it take, do you think, to make that trip at that height?  350 miles?  It's under an hour, that's for sure.  Yeah.  It's probably...  Right on that trip, about a half hour.  Maybe 45 minutes.  45 minutes. 
[00:28:30]  40 minutes.  I was going to say, yeah, 40, 45 minutes sounds about right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, they do at that height, say 550 miles an hour.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I guess so.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Just a bizarre turn of events.  I mean, have they ever lost a plane for this long without any trace?  I know that Air France plane that left Brazil had a problem, but they knew it went down in  the ocean.  Amelia Earhart. 
[00:29:00]  Amelia Earhart.  Maybe, you know, this is the first one since then.  Since fucking, yeah.  The big war.  But it's like, I don't remember hearing of anything where a plane this large with this  many people on it disappeared without a trace.  That's unbelievable.  Oceanic, maybe.  Yeah.  Good old oceanic.  Yeah.  So I guess that's the latest on that.  Latest on that is there's not really much latest.  I know.  It's the turn.  And then in other news, close to home, this Obama guy was in town. 
[00:29:30]  Obama came to New York.  Look, the president can't just do these trips anymore.  Back in the day, a president, of course, the Kennedy thing ruined it for future presidents.  But they can't just come in and out of big, huge cities and do regular things for photo  ops.  Yeah.  Traffic in Manhattan yesterday was a complete and utter nightmare. 
[00:30:00]  The traffic was at a standstill.  I had family members doing things yesterday.  And they basically couldn't move.  No, it freezes the whole city up.  And this is so Obama could have a photo op at a Gap store here in Times Square.  He was shopping at the Gap for his wife and daughter.  And it was such a surprise.  I don't think anyone knew about it.  He must have just turned and said, hey, I want to go shopping at the Gap.  Oh, that's right.  It was pre-planned.  They found out an hour before. 
[00:30:30]  An hour.  Did they really?  Yeah.  Because I mean, I'm sure Secret Service had to go in.  Of course.  Yeah.  But they have found out an hour before.  There's like 20 customers.  But I wonder if they told the customers.  Probably not.  They don't shut down just a road anymore for the president.  I've seen the motorcade.  I've seen the Obama motorcade come through New York at least two, maybe three.  No, three times.  Oh, no.  One of them might have been Bush.  And I've seen Bush's motorcade a couple times over the years.  They shut down entire sections of the city now.  It's not just one road. 
[00:31:00]  So everyone is inconvenienced.  And then he walks around a Gap store to pick out sweaters and stuff so he makes all the papers this morning.  Like, they've got to do away with that.  It's just not fair to anyone anymore.  No.  People lost business yesterday.  Do you think some people...  Because they couldn't get stuff done.  Do you think the people that worked there were like, I'll be with you in a minute?  Like they're helping other customers?  They were too busy smiling and jerking off.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  The president's in our store right now.  He's buying a sweater.  Oh, my God.  I put that sweater out.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have to refold that one that he just picked up.  You think Obama refolds or just throws it back on the pile?  He throws it back.  They said it was weird because they thought he would refold it, but he threw it on the floor.  And then he said to the woman, pick it up, white bitch.  And they're like, man, that doesn't sound like something a president should be saying.  The Gap.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  We get it, Obama.  But that just snarls traffic in a horrendous way.  I mean, if you're coming to New York, you got some fundraisers.  I guess that's what it was.  Go to your dumb fundraisers and get the hell out of here so people can go back to work.  He was making a statement here.  I'm reading it on the...  I heard it on the news.  It is a minimum wage thing.  It is.  There was something going on, I guess...  But Gap people don't make minimum wage, do they?  Somebody that works there, maybe a stockroom guy.  But they took the minimum wage and raised it higher than the state minimum wage for Gap employees that do make minimum wage. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, okay.  And he wanted to show, like, you know, I'm supporting businesses that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then I guess he was also talking about...  What happens to those sweaters?  Oh, boy.  His wife and girls are not wearing the Gap stuff.  I'm telling you right now.  You think they're on the top of the drawer or on the front and center in the closet?  I would imagine he brings them back to the White House and then they ship them...  Now, off to charity. 
[00:33:00]  Off to some kind of charity.  Goes to fucking Uganda.  Goes to the Congo.  You think Michelle Obama is going to walk around with a Gap sweater?  Hannah.  Ah, Hannah.  Ah, Hannah.  No.  Yeah.  I want to say hi to...  The only thing Gap on her are those teeth.  Whoa.  Leonard in Atlanta.  Leonard.  Oh, yeah.  I got something to add to that little plane mystery.  I went on the news overnight that the cell phones of all the passengers, the majority 
[00:33:30]  of them are still showing...  We heard that.  We heard that.  But it's not.  Yeah, we talked about it yesterday.  Well, you know, I'm about half brain dead, so I probably didn't hear it yesterday.  Yeah, no, it doesn't mean anything.  So, what would that mean?  If I smash my phone and you call it, it's still going to ring.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  They say, oh, they're still ringing, the phones.  Of course they are.  No, just ring.  Phones always ring.  Even if the phone itself isn't ringing, you hear it on your end ringing.  Right.  When have you ever called a phone and heard no ringing but a voice going, that phone's 
[00:34:00]  broken.  Yes, the phone was involved in a plane crash.  But didn't they say the other day that the phones were kind of picking up, too, or something,  and then hanging up, or...  It was probably just that thing where it rings for a while and then stops.  Yeah.  It makes, like, a little weird sound that would sound like a pickup if you're hoping  it's a dead relative.  Right.  You're hoping against hope.  But it's not.  It's just that it makes a weird clicking sound and stops ringing.  Right.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I don't think that means anything.  What do you think, Leonard?  You called with this.  Yeah, exactly.  Leonard, what?  Well, I feel like I'm just a damn dumbass. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, buddy.  Let me go to Timmy in New York City.  He's a highway cop.  Timmy, you got some insight on this Obama thing?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We know way in advance where he's going to go.  Like, as far as Jimmy said, he thought going to the gap was like a, you know,  oh, geez, I'm nervous.  Ha, ha, listen to him.  I love how we have to point it out.  Ha, ha, you're nervous.  Just make believe you're pulling us over and you're the fucking alpha. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Yes.  Christ.  Walk up to that window.  It sucks.  Yeah, we know where he's going.  We have guys in cars plus regular foot posts that are all over the place.  Like, he came and went to Junior's Cheesecake Place a couple months ago,  and that we did not know, and that was like utter panic.  What happened?  He just decided to do it?  Yeah, we knew initially before he landed, we knew that he was going to make a stop to Junior's, 
[00:35:30]  and it was like a big deal because normally there's guys like literally on every single street corner,  every block was shut down, and in that case it wasn't, but like we were going down the street,  and there was like intersections with cars just stopped at light, intersections with no cops.  Like, it was obviously fine, but like as far as we're concerned, like, you know,  we thought it kind of made us look bad because normally it's just like a smooth shot.  It takes them two seconds to go across town, and it took like five minutes.  Can he, like, I know that once in a while the president will do what they call those unscheduled stops,  and the Secret Service never wants them to do it. 
[00:36:00]  No.  But if he just wants to do something and go, stop, I want to get out here,  they just have to scramble and guard, right?  I'd advise against that, Mr. President.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How dare you, sir?  Yeah, or if he throws a terrorist off his plane and says, get off my plane.  My plane.  Harrison Ford's a douche.  Take the earring out, you're 58, asshole.  Enough with Harrison Ford.  58, he wishes he was 58.  Yeah, whatever he is.  He's probably 68 at this point.  So, yeah, you guys all know, right? 
[00:36:30]  We don't necessarily know.  Like, in the main motorcade, there'll be, like, a federal guy with us, and, you know,  they don't even talk to us.  You kind of just have to, like, overhear what they're talking about.  Right.  But we basically know the route.  He gets in the car, we move him from point A to point B, and then the rest of that stuff,  we don't really know.  Oh, one of those things.  I'm in charge here.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm the captain.  He improvised that.  Did you know that?  I never did.  Did he really?  Yeah, I'd love to really ask him about that.  I hear he's broke. 
[00:37:00]  That poor guy is broke already.  He got a few grand for the movie, and that's it.  It was, you know, a while ago.  Yeah, he bought a pork pie hat.  He spent $34,000 on it.  Idiot.  He didn't win the award.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Thanks, Phil.  But the president moving around and doing regular things, you know, you can't do it anymore.  Because too many people suffer and can't get their jobs done.  But they're not.  They can't go about their business.  The Secret Service is right, though.  Like, you know, because Gerald Ford did that walk that time through that park. 
[00:37:30]  And what, didn't the woman try to shoot or stab him or, uh...  Was that squeaky?  No.  I don't know if that was a squeaky from incident.  I think it was Gerald Ford.  And it was a walkthrough at a park, and they didn't want him to do it.  But he just decided to.  Yeah, two people tried to kill Ford.  Both women.  Yeah, both chicks.  Squeaky from, and the other one, like, across the street at a hotel.  She, like, did she shoot at him, or she just pulled a gun and somebody grabbed it?  What happened?  Is Squeaky still alive?  The squeakster?  I don't think so.  The squeakster?  She's still in jail, I hope.  She was such a weirdo. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  That fucking wacky look she had.  I tell you, Manson must have a huge cock, because he really owns women.  Lynette's squeaky from.  Yes.  And Manson got a lot of them broads.  Let's go to Elliot in Jersey.  Elliot.  B-b-boy.  Oh, yeah.  Enough with the b-b-boys.  It should.  What's up, Elliot?  Well, cell phones, when powered on, will ring.  When cell phones are powered off, there's no power going to them.  They just go straight to voicemail. 
[00:38:30]  So what do you think?  Aliens?  I think they're powered on.  They're still on.  They're getting a signal, and they're crashed somewhere.  Here's another theory coming in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Plane was taken.  Thank you.  Landed somewhere.  Yeah.  All the people are being held as hostages, while the plane is fitted with explosives  and whatnot, to be used in a huge terrorist attack, where they will fly it into something 
[00:39:00]  with big explosives.  There you go.  You just made that up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good theory.  It's a good theory.  Yeah.  Except the, where are you going to land a fucking 777 without anyone noticing.  There'd be an issue if all of a sudden, they're like, yes, the captain, we're back.  What happened?  Oh, we'll talk to you about it.  Long story.  We'll talk to you about it.  Long story.  We'll talk to you about it if we land, when we land. 
[00:39:30]  You know what?  We're probably going to laugh about this.  Yeah.  Mostly, we'll have a good laugh about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The squeaky girl got paroled.  She's out, according to John in South Carolina.  It's squeaky from fucking walking around.  I believe I'm almost.  She tried to kill the president.  Once you shoot at a president, you should never get out.  Fucking Hinckley.  Yeah.  Because it's such a violation of the entire country.  Fucking John Hinckley gets to go home.  Fuck this piece of shit.  I don't care that Reagan lived. 
[00:40:00]  He should never be allowed to leave his cell.  Never.  He's still doing those day passes or whatever?  Yeah.  Are they supervised, unsupervised?  What are they?  There's a different set of rules when you kill a cop because they're a protected group because  they wear uniforms.  Yeah.  And there should be a different set of rules.  If you take a shot at the president, you should never fucking get out.  Right.  Ever.  Fucking James Brady's drooling into his lap.  Right.  And this guy's just walking around.  The cell phones, they could track that if they're still on. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they do that?  I'm sure they did that already.  Yeah.  And they're all in the same place somewhere.  Oh, boy.  Whoops.  Oh, no.  Ooh.  I say they find the plane today.  Today's the day.  Southeast Asia.  Today they find the crash site.  A lot of real estate down there to fuck around with.  Yeah, but they said they got like three warships and two helicopters.  So, they're good.  Yeah.  They're good with the search.  Yeah.  So, it's just a matter of time. 
[00:41:00]  Ooh.  Food is here.  Look at that.  I say that whenever I look at Kenny's pants.  Oh.  Oh, Kenny.  So, what's the big deal with the Zach Galifianakis interview?  He's pretty big balls, Zach.  He's, uh...  Did he ask the president?  He said, what's it like to be the last black president?  Yes.  That's pretty funny.  That's fucking hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  We got clips from that?  Is it a long interview?  No, it's six minutes long.  All right.  So, we'll do it after the break.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  There's a nice pause on this thing from Funny or Die.  It looks photoshopped or green screened.  Maybe they did it in a safe location for Obama and then green screened it in the background.  Yeah.  It was at the White House.  Oh, it was.  It was at the White House.  That's what they all look like, though.  Oh, they do?  Okay, I've never watched it.  That's a coup right there.  One more call on the plane thing because it's based on a book.  This whole thing is based on a book.  Yeah.  It's similar to a plot in a book.  Oh, is it?  According to Chuck in Chicago. 
[00:42:00]  Chuck.  Yeah, good morning.  Good morning, buddy.  Chuck, Chuck, Bobuck.  You can never do Chuck with the name game.  Yes, you could.  Chuck, Chuck, Bobuck, Banana Fanna, Doduck, Me, My, and Momok.  It was Banana Fanna for fuck.  Oh.  And you'd get in trouble.  I wouldn't even.  That wouldn't occur to me.  Yes, it did occur to me all the time with the name game.  But then Anthony or Tony would come up.  Tony, Tony, Boboni.  And I would start crying.  As you should.  Because I did not want to be called Tony, first of all.  That was not my name.  My name is Anthony. 
[00:42:30]  And I didn't like the name game song.  And my brother used to point at me and sing it.  And I would start crying.  My friend Bunt hated that game, too.  So make sure he gets one less plug on this show.  Let's get him back, finally.  Yeah.  Let's get Joe back for what he did to you.  I know.  Chuck, go ahead, buddy.  I can't remember the name of the book.  But if you Google stolen 727 terrorist plot, somebody wrote a book about this. 
[00:43:00]  And, you know, it was a far-fetched idea that somebody stole a plane and was going to fly it into a building in Philadelphia.  But it was based on a true story of a 727 that was stolen in the 70s that they don't think was linked to terrorism.  But somebody did steal it and flew it off.  They think it crashed.  But it's not too far-fetched to think that somebody could steal a plane and land it somewhere.  I mean, in that area of the world, there are just millions of square miles of nothing. 
[00:43:30]  Here's the problem with your theory.  We would have known this by now.  If you're going to go through the trouble of stealing a plane and landing it somewhere, whoever did that would like to tell the world by now.  What are they waiting for?  It's on military radars.  The transponder didn't communicate, but they know where it was.  They probably have a much better idea now where it was.  We're what, four days into this, they would be going, okay, yeah, we did hijack the plane, and this is what we want.  That's absolutely true.  But the thing is, in that area of the world, you're not dealing with as many close radar arrays together. 
[00:44:00]  And if you have something low enough that is going to be shielded by the curve of the horizon, radar won't pick it up.  Now, it's far-fetched.  I grant you that.  But it's not unthinkable that somebody could be hiding this plane and, you know, modifying it for some type of terrorist purpose.  Look, man.  You know, a lot of these pilots over the years have seen, you know, what they think is, you know, UFOs and alien spaceships.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, how amazing would this be?  They just fucking snatched the goddamn plane up.  The aliens took the airplane.  That is a game-changer for the world.  How great would that be?  They finally find the fucking plane.  It's a satellite image of, like, the top of Mount Everest, and it's just sitting up there.  Yeah.  Yeah, imagine if the aliens, that's what they do.  They just place it up there gently.  You have to beat dicks.  Wouldn't you do that if you had the potential to be an alien dick? 
[00:45:00]  Just let's place it up there in pristine condition.  Right on the fucking summit.  Right on the point.  And you guys figure it out.  Oh, my God.  Would we be scared?  And then they just go away for another, like, thousand years.  Right.  Who cares?  Right.  It's their Andy Kaufman.  Yeah.  And they find, like, little alien dumps on the way.  And the passengers report that the aliens are all squatting and dropping little green  duties on the way, and then they zipped away.  And what they interpreted as alien chuckles. 
[00:45:30]  Just laughing.  Yes, they high-fived with their three-fingered hands and laughed.  Smeared on the window.  Rolling gags.  What a set of these.  It's the equivalent of just running over mailboxes with your car.  That's right.  Let's say hi to Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Yo, Keith.  Gentlemen.  Hey, Keith.  Hey, Keith.  It's Keith, uh, Jimmy's Apple Consultant.  Oh.  Oh, hi.  Yeah, great.  I sent you guys all that cereal back in October.  Hi, Keith.  Yeah, oof. 
[00:46:00]  That laugh.  What's up, buddy?  Amy Schumer.  Don't forget Amy Schumer's State Theater on Saturday Night in New Brunswick.  But, uh, listen, there's an episode of Star Trek Voyager called The 37s, which they  find Amelia Earhart and all these other people that have gone missing in plane, uh, plane  disappearances over the years, and they were sucked into another part of the galaxy.  There's also a movie.  Mm-hmm.  That didn't happen.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh.  That's right.  That's right.  Called Millennium, in which any time it's a plane disaster, people in the future grab the 
[00:46:30]  plane, hold and suspended animation, offload the people, because apparently they can't  breathe in the future, replace all the people's body doubles, bring the plane back to crash.  Yeah, and then they have those people.  And then there's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which, of course, you remember the big  ship comes back and gives back, you know, some of the people that were lost in the Bermuda  Triangle and other places.  Yeah, this plane crashed somewhere.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  I'm sure it did.  Okay.  It's all fun and games to speculate about, aliens or some kind of conspiracy plots.  But, truth of the matter is, it probably just wandered away with no one at the controls  and finally crashed somewhere.  All right.  Yeah, sure.  But don't forget about Amy Schumer at the State Theater.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  White knight over here.  Let's say hi to James in Ontario.  Former Apple consultant.  James.  Hey, just wondering, why did it take that country's military three or four days to report that a 
[00:47:30]  plane had gone through their airspace?  It's like, do they have nobody at the helm looking at the radar 24-7?  Like, it's a country with a military.  That's true.  Or maybe they knew from day one, but just didn't feel like telling us through.  Add another piece.  They don't have any responsibility to tell us anything.  False flag.  So, what do you think that means, sir?  I mean, it's just, I feel like you're enlisting all the things that are weird about this case, 
[00:48:00]  and I just think it's another one.  Just another weird contributing factor.  Weird thing.  All right.  Well, until they find this fucking thing, there's not many questions going to be answered.  Yeah, it's pretty insane.  That's been, what, four days?  Craig Craig.  I still don't know where the plane is.  That's unbelievable in this day.  Well, is it?  I think.  All right.  When we get back, we've got the Obama Funny or Die interview with Zach Galifianakis.  Yes, I want to hear that.  I could finally, finally pronounce his name after all these years. 
[00:48:30]  Galifianakis.  Zach?  It wasn't weird.  I had a tough time for a long, a long, long time.  Yeah, yeah.  Galifianakis.  Galifianakis.  Galifianakis.  What it was.  So he did an interview with Obama, and then Fox News reacts to Obama on Funny or Die.  On Between Two Ferns.  That's the show.  Oh, it's that show.  Yeah.  I don't watch it.  All right.  I'm not a fan of Zach Galifianakis.  Not really.  How can you not be a fan if you don't watch him?  He was great.  I've seen clips over the years, Sam. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  I have.  I'm just not a fan of him.  For whatever reason.  I think he's overrated.  I think he was terrific in Hangover.  How's his stand-up?  I don't even know his stand-up.  He's funny.  He's actually really funny.  Yeah.  Maybe I shouldn't say that, then.  Yeah, if you don't.  He's never done our show.  That's never how you feel.  Fuck him.  He's never done our show.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  Food?  Eat time?  Food all right?  Food all right.  Very busy show today.  We've got Bernard Hopkins coming in in a little while. 
[00:49:30]  He's fighting again.  He fights a lot.  Jesus.  He's a tough motherfucker.  Boy, is he going to punch someone in the face?  Is that what he's going to do this time?  Yeah, a lot.  A lot?  Repeatedly?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to ask him about it.  He spoke in front of the Senate.  Oh, yeah?  About brain injuries and boxers.  And I would like to ask him about that.  Yeah, if it's a problem in the NFL, you've got to think it's a problem in boxing.  Yeah.  Right? 
[00:50:00]  I don't know how they do it.  Or how Hopkins stays as mentally sharp and healthy, or Mayweather, who's 36 or 37 now.  Yeah.  Some guys just don't.  But those guys don't get hit a lot to the head.  But you know what he pointed out, which is, he said it's not the fight, it's in the gym.  That's true.  You forget, like, oh yeah, they spar and they're getting punched in the fucking face every day.  On a daily basis, yeah.  Even though they've got that headgear, that headgear still, you know, rattles the brain inside.  That's right.  It's all physics. 
[00:50:30]  It's still going to fucking...  That brain just moves around in there, man.  Smashing into the inside of your skull.  Yeah, it's not anchored down.  Oh.  We also have the Zach Galifianakis interview with Obama.  All right.  I wanted to hear a little of the ant.  Yes.  Very, very, very busy show.  Very busy.  Hi, who's this?  This is Bobo.  Oh, no.  Some of my friends were suggesting they call her to talk about that experience of watching  My Wife Hates Me live at the Village Underground yesterday. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they did.  I have to say, I've never...  I don't know what the heck makes them click that they're still together, but I've never  seen a couple argue this that much and still be together.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I really have never seen anything like that in my life. 
[00:51:30]  In your whole life.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've never seen anything like that in my whole life.  All right.  We heard you.  Yeah, I remember that, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that, yeah.  Also, I do got to announce that I am doing a little birthday gathering before the Met game  on the 26th of April.  You're throwing your own birthday party?  Yeah, a little gathering.  I'm encouraging all my friends and family to show up.  I got some that are going to show up.  I ran into Big A last night, and he said you just kept babbling about your birthday party. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I know.  I was worried about people showing up.  It's at McFadden's adjacent to Citi Field.  Uh-huh.  And, of course, you guys are invited.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Bobo, for the big invite.  I appreciate it.  Congratulations on all the Twitter followers.  Yeah, I know.  Thank you, guys.  You do realize they're not real followers, right? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that's the thing.  I realize that there's a lot of them that are not real followers.  I mean, I know I got a lot of followers.  Well, not really.  But there's a lot more than, but not that much.  And there's...  How many is he up to?  222,000 followers.  How many do you think are real, Bobo?  How many of those followers do you think are real followers of yours? 
[00:53:00]  I think there might be 6,000.  Okay.  So 6,000 out of...  222,000.  Almost a quarter of a million.  All right.  At least he's...  They always say 6 out of 222 ain't bad.  That's true.  That's the average numbers I've seen in it.  I've seen before whoever...  I don't know what...  Who messed with my Twitter?  I don't know who messed with this not knowing any passwords or did something that...  That's some kind of, like, spam program. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, Bobo.  It's whatever it is.  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Good not seeing you last night.  Of course, the party's at 12 o'clock.  Okay.  Okay.  Still plugging.  It's a month and a half out, I think.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  When is it?  April...  What?  April 26th.  All right.  A month and a half out.  You have plenty of time to get people there.  Noon or midnight?  Noon.  Oh.  All right.  We got to go.  Thanks, Bobo.  All right.  I'll see you guys at Super Show 3. 
[00:54:00]  Actually, no, you won't.  Maybe not.  No, I don't think you made the cut.  Bobo, is Jim invited to the birthday party?  He is.  Jimmy's invited.  Jimmy, you're going to drop everything to go to Bobo's birthday party?  No.  All right, Bobo.  We got to go.  It was a great phone call, though.  All right.  I hope I did make the cut for Super Show 3.  We're not really sure.  Oh, God.  We're putting the lineup together right now.  We're pretty sure.  Here's my prediction. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Now this is all you will read on fucking Twitter and everything about how he hopes he makes  the cut for Super Show 3.  Yeah, good luck.  When is Super Show 3?  Is it on the docket?  It is.  We have to figure out some other events.  Why?  Because Asia's pulled out?  Well, yeah.  And we also don't want to just pile an event on top of an event on top of an event.  Right.  All right.  I look forward to Super Show 3.  It's going to be great.  What day is it on?  I don't know yet.  We don't know yet.  That's what we're going to do.  We've got to make sure Jimmy's here for this one. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  He missed the last one.  And Colin Quinn has to be here as well.  Yeah.  Now we can work around people's schedules a little better than we could last time.  Good.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  There's only two guys making out on the news.  What is just...  What's wrong with that?  It is just...  It's...  It's...  Welcome to 1999, everyone.  Like, what?  No.  Because instantly...  I'm just being honest.  The second you look and see it, there's just something that, as a heterosexual male, you 
[00:55:30]  look at and go, ugh.  I support butt.  Right.  You support butt?  I support butts.  I support butts.  But it's rough to look at.  You're right.  It is.  It's just still...  There's this reaction that you're like, oh, oh.  Two guys kissing is hard.  It's uncomfortable.  Yes.  To watch.  Yeah.  It's sorry.  I don't know why.  It's the kissing.  It's the intimacy of it.  Yes.  I have enough trouble with a heterosexual couple kissing.  I think it's easier to see them blowing each other than actually kissing. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Like, porno is just like, oh, that's what it is.  It's porno.  Who cares?  Yeah.  The one guy turns his head all the way around.  Turns that baseball cap around.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  But that kissing thing is just looking into each other's eyes all lovingly.  Yeah.  Caressing each other's cheeks.  I don't know, man.  Look, I don't advocate any problems with gay people.  No violence.  No discrimination. 
[00:56:30]  None of that shit.  But if you're telling me there isn't some visceral reaction that men get watching that, some kind of repulsion, revulsion, whatever you want to call it, it's there.  Sorry.  But let me ask you this.  Is it gay?  Yes.  Yes.  If a woman has a strap on and pokes it against your asshole and just jabs in a little bit and asks you if you like your pussy filled while you're playing with your nipples. 
[00:57:00]  I'm just asking if that's gay.  Oh, my God.  If you like your pussy filled.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It's a question.  It's a fair question.  Wow.  Who's asking this?  Are you asking for a friend?  Yeah.  Just curious.  Okay.  That is a heck of a scenario.  Wow.  I think you're pussy filled. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm just asking.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Hi, Sean.  Hey, bu-bu-bu-bu-buddy.  Oh, fuck that's it.  God damn it.  I can't stand it.  I should be an instant hang-up.  Yes, enough with the bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  I love that most people don't even know the guy that did that.  I know.  Who's the guy's name who did that, sir?  I have no fucking clue to say.  It was Bruce Mittman when we were up in the Boston area at AAF, our GM. 
[00:58:00]  He used to call us bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  Oh.  He would always come in, bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  Enough about the failure.  The check for the sugar.  Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  Please don't talk about this.  He doesn't want you telling these stories anymore.  Oh, I know.  He said it's bad for business.  Bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  Have you seen ozone?  I'm a little light on the marijuana.  Bu-bu-bu-bu-boys.  I forgot my stepladder to get into my SUV. 
[00:58:30]  Could you help me?  I got the biggest truck in the parking lot, bu-bu-bu-boys, because I'm...  I'm tiny.  I'm pretty much considered a midget.  Yeah.  We loved the Bruce Mittman.  Loved the guy.  So what do you got?  Bill Burr has an awesome stand-up bit about watching two guys make out on Expect Your Leaves.  It's fucking hilarious.  Is it on one of his CDs or something?  Can we find that maybe, guys?  Who does?  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  We'll play that, because now it makes sense.  We'll play it into break or something after our Bernard Hopkins interview.  Thank you, sir.  I'm making out.  You just programmed our radio show.  Feel good about yourself.  Making out.  Making out.  Making out.  Tell myself I could be, should be.  Making out.  But all.  Stop.  What?  Stop singing the song.  It's so bad.  It gets stuck in your head.  You don't like the song?  Oh.  Making out.  Tell myself I could be, should be.  Making out.  Oh. 
[00:59:30]  But all.  Frankenstein and the Wolfman.  Oh.  God, do I hate it.  There's some Oakland Raiders making out.  Making out.  I said Raiders.  Why?  The Oakland Raiders.  He's got his hot crusaders.  But me.  All right.  All right.  Wait, Sam, you don't like this song?  No, I don't like this song.  You really, uh.  No, I'm going to get Bobo back on the phone now, because you did this, Dustin.  Oh, no.  I don't like this.  I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I think it should be turned off, too.  That was a Todd shoehorn right there.  Driving in his Maverick.  If you don't like this song, you know what you should do.  Get over it.  Oh.  Nice.  Get over it.  Hitching a fit.  Oh, are you?  All the trying and crying.  Hitching a fit.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Another day.  Yeah.  Of hours.  Of this.  Like, it's just hitting my.  Yeah.  It's playing ping pong in my brain, back and forth.  Get over it.  I know.  Pitching a fit.  Get over it. 
[01:00:30]  No, no, no.  Pitching.  It won't stop.  I know.  We kind of want to call our next live event, Opie and Anthony, Pitching a Fit.  Pitching a fit.  That's a good idea.  Pitching a fit.  We'll get over it.  Should we play the Bill Burr thing?  I don't know if this is it or not.  I don't know.  We're going on a break.  All right.  We'll do it.  We're going on a break.  Should we do the Zach Galifianakis?  Yeah.  I want to hear that.  Let's talk about the Obama thing.  My mother can't say his name.  She's like Zach Gaffanella.  Oh, that's cute.  It is.  Sometimes a good punch to the jaw straight and your mom right out. 
[01:01:00]  From Funny or Die.  It's Between Two Ferns.  I know.  I know the show.  With Zach Galifianakis.  How did he get Obama?  They have a good relationship with the White House.  They said the Funny or Die.  They do.  They don't.  Am I lying?  I don't think you're lying, but Obama wants to get young people signed up to the health  care.  Health care.  That's how you get to the young people.  Right. 
[01:01:30]  Sorry, I had to cancel a few times.  Thank you, Travis.  My mouse pad broke last week and I had to get my great aunt some diabetes shoes.  You know what, Zach?  It's no problem.  I mean, I have to say, when I heard that people actually watch this show, I was actually pretty  surprised.  Hi.  Welcome to another edition of Between Two Ferns.  I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis.  And my guest today is Barack Obama. 
[01:02:00]  President Barack Obama.  Good to be with you, Zach.  First question.  In 2013, you pardoned the turkey.  What do you have planned for 2014?  We'll probably pardon another turkey.  We do that every Thanksgiving.  Was that depressing to you, seeing one turkey taken out of school?  This is cringe-inducing.  Well, it's just not.  What, Sam?  You should open big.  He's not good at it.  It's funny.  No, it isn't.  That's his, that's his, that's Zach's character on the show.  I know what it is. 
[01:02:30]  I don't like it.  But Obama is.  What's wrong with it?  Yeah.  It's a little forced.  I mean, I don't know if it's forced.  You don't think it's funny to be like, everything he did in 2013 is brought down to just pardoning  a turkey?  No.  That's funny.  Not only that, but that's his first question.  That's question one, is bringing up the pardoned turkey that every president had always done.  All right, I guess we're not, I guess we're not cool like you guys.  I don't, what is that?  I saw Anthony's look, too.  I felt it, so I turned toward him. 
[01:03:00]  He's not.  Do you understand nothing could be happening in this video that Anthony would be happy about  unless one, unless somebody was resigning?  And Obama just comes across as, he's just a nerd.  He is a nerd.  Go ahead.  Maybe we're.  Wrong.  Yeah, maybe.  Let's see.  Turkey, couldn't he?  See, there's just Obama making a fat joke about Zach Galifianakis.  What did he say?  He said, did that depress you, that there was a turkey pardoned that you couldn't eat?  Ah, there you go. 
[01:03:30]  It's funny.  It's the president.  It's bullying.  It's bullying.  Look at it, it says President Barack Obama, and next to it it says spelling with a question  mark, community organizer.  Ah, ha.  It's the most original interview Obama's done in his entire...  Well, let's give it a shot.  Zach.  First question.  In 2013, he pardoned the turkey.  Have you heard this part?  What do you have planned for 2014?  We'll probably pardon another turkey.  We do that every Thanksgiving.  Was that depressing to you, seeing one turkey kind of taken out of circulation, a turkey you 
[01:04:00]  couldn't eat?  I was just staring at him.  So how does this work?  Do you send Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf?  I read somewhere that you'd be sending Hulk Hogan to Syria.  Or is that more of a job for Tonya Harding?  Zach, he's not our ambassador.  What should we do about North Ikea?  Why don't we move on?  I have to know, what is it like to be the last black president?  Seriously?  That's good. 
[01:04:30]  What's it like?  You think that's funny?  That's a great question.  That is a good one.  Isn't that funny?  The Ikea thing was stupid.  The Dennis Rodman line was great.  The Dennis Rodman thing was funny.  You're all in, Jimmy?  Yeah, I like Zach.  I think I genuinely...  But you're all in on this?  Because, again, it's...  It's with the sitting president.  There's only so much you can do.  I like when Chris Farley did it.  It was way more believable.  But he did it with McCartney, didn't he?  Yeah, he did.  This isn't the same thing that Chris Farley did.  Yeah, it's similar.  This is a guy who's kind of a dick who's, you know... 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, no, I'm with you, Sam.  On this one.  For this to be the last time you ever talk to a president.  It must kind of stink, though, that you can't run, you know, three times.  No, actually, I think it's a good idea.  You know, if I ran a third time, it'd be sort of like doing a third hangover movie.  It didn't really work out very well, did it?  Oh.  You think that's funny?  That's funny.  Okay.  So I was annoyed.  Because it sucked.  Right.  And Obama just told him his movie sucked.  Told him his movie sucked.  That was funny.  All right, good.  Now, I have to say that I've seen this show before, and some of the episodes have probably 
[01:05:30]  been a little bit better than this.  You know, for example, the one with Bradley Cooper, that was a great movie.  Bradley Cooper, yeah, everybody loves Bradley.  He kind of carried that movie, didn't he?  Which film are you speaking of?  Those hangover movies.  Basically, he carried them.  Yeah, everybody loves Bradley.  Good for him.  Good looking guy.  Being like that in Hollywood, that's easy.  Tall, handsome, that's easy.  Be short, fat, and smell like Doritos and try to make it Hollywood. 
[01:06:00]  Is it going to be hard in two years when you're not...  That one was not a pass from you?  We don't have to go over every joke.  Why not?  Yeah, maybe we do.  I am...  I'm just watching a little six-minute interview on there.  That wasn't...  I don't know what's talking about this, so...  And then Fox had something to say.  Keep going.  ...no longer president, and people will stop letting you win at basketball?  How does it feel having a three-inch...  Great question.  It's a three-inch horizontal, so... 
[01:06:30]  Wait, what was Obama's comeback there?  Is it going to be hard in two years when you're no longer president,  and people will stop letting you win at basketball?  How does it feel having a three-inch vertical?  It's a three-inch horizontal, so...  Where are you planning on building a presidential library in Hawaii or your home country of Kenya?  Because...  That's pretty funny right there. 
[01:07:00]  All right, he's turning to me.  Your home country of Kenya.  That is a pulse.  It's the fucking president.  Library in Hawaii or your home country of Kenya?  Because, I mean, both places seem like they would be...  Zach, that's a ridiculous question.  Well, you know, I mean, not to bring up the birth certificate thing,  but you really never did really produce your...  Where's your birth certificate?  Why don't you show it to us right now?  I don't want to show anybody my birth certificate, because it's embarrassing.  What's embarrassing about it?  My weight on it, it says that I was born seven pounds, 800 ounces. 
[01:07:30]  You know what I would do if I were president, Mr. President?  I would make same-sex divorce illegal.  Then see how bad they want it.  I think that's why you're not president.  And that's a good thing.  You said if you had a son, you would not let him play football.  What makes you think that he would want to play football?  What if he was a nerd like you?  Do you think a woman like Michelle would marry a nerd?  Nerd like you.  Why don't you ask her whether she thinks I'm a nerd?  Could I?  No, I'm not going to let her near you. 
[01:08:00]  So do you go to any websites that are .coms or .nets,  or do you mainly just stick with .govs?  No, I said we go to .govs.  Have you heard of healthcare.gov?  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  That's good.  That's great.  It's picked up.  Yeah, you would sound like a fucking dick that keeps saying it sucks.  Yeah.  That's good.  Have you heard of healthcare.gov?  Here we go.  Okay, let's get this out of the way. 
[01:08:30]  What did you come here to plug?  Well, first of all, I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't be with you here today  if I didn't have something to plug.  Have you heard of the Affordable Care Act?  Oh, yeah, I heard about that.  That's the thing that doesn't work.  Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?  Healthcare.gov works great now.  And millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans.  And what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable healthcare.  Most young Americans, right now, they're not covered. 
[01:09:00]  And the truth is that they can get coverage all for what it costs you to pay your cell phone bill.  Is this what they mean by drones?  The point is that a lot of young people, they think they're invincible.  Did you say invisible?  Because I just think that's a problem.  No, not invisible.  Invincible.  Meaning that they don't think they can get hurt.  I was just saying that nobody could be invisible if you had said invisible.  I understand that. 
[01:09:30]  If they get that health insurance, it can really make a big difference.  And they've got until March 31st to sign up.  I don't have a computer, so how does...  Well, then you can call 1-800-318-2596.  I don't have a phone.  I'm off the grid.  I don't want you people, like, looking at my text.  You know what I mean?  First of all, Zach, nobody's interested in your texts.  But second of all, you can do it in person.  And the law means that insurers can't discriminate against you if you've got to plead existing condition.  Yeah, but what about...  Plugs. 
[01:10:00]  What about this, though?  That's disgusting.  How long have you had that?  Oh, just four months.  They had an arm.  Really?  Spider bites.  I got attacked by spiders.  Zach, you need to get that checked right away.  You need to get on healthcare.gov because...  Here's why I like this.  Even though he's plugging, the president is doing a goof interview.  The guy is really shitting on him, so he's got to get something out.  Oh, yeah, I respect that part.  There has to be some reason for him to do this. 
[01:10:30]  There's some funny shit in here.  Oh, my God, dude.  I would not have the balls to do that.  Oh, my God.  Is your plug finally over?  I suppose so.  So which country were you rooting for in the Winter Olympics?  Seriously?  I'm the president of the United States.  What do you think, Zach?  I want to thank President Obama for being on the show.  I'm going to press this.  Don't touch that, please.  It's a new backdrop. 
[01:11:00]  Thanks for the interview.  And I think it's the White House.  It's in the White House.  Right.  Oh, that actually was not a backdrop?  The black part was just a sheet over the room in the White House.  Thanks for the interview.  And thanks for letting me shoot my show here all these years.  You've been shooting these shows here in the diplomatic room? 
[01:11:30]  Who gave you permission to do that?  Bush.  Seriously?  Who gave him clearance?  Oh, boy.  What's the spider bite?  That's the other hand.  No, it's everywhere.  It's all done.  That's pretty good.  That's a fucking...  That's pretty good.  That's a...  Your fucking home country of Kenya.  That's really funny.  It's really funny. 
[01:12:00]  So Fox had a problem with that.  Of course.  Why would they?  Of course.  Why would they have a problem with that?  Well, because it involves Obama.  Exactly.  If Bush did it, they'd go, he's letting his hair down and having fun and...  Right, right.  Oh, God.  I hate the media.  Here's the take.  I have not heard this, but there it is.  With the economy the way it is, I don't think it's appropriate for the President of the United  States.  They're joking.  Benghazi.  Right.  And the IRS scandal, which I believe are... 
[01:12:30]  People have real problems with the fact that he's never...  Right, right.  With the...  Is this what a president should be doing when recovery is this slow?  Right.  How come they don't say that after the White House Correspondents Dinner?  Where it's a roast for the President and the Congress and all these Senate...  Where's that commentary?  They do it every year.  The President gets ripped on and roasted, so stop it.  Yeah, I have no problem with this.  And it did turn out pretty good.  Yeah.  They're all good.  The plug was a little long and whatever.  Right. 
[01:13:00]  Why don't you go work with Zach Galifianakis?  I'm just saying, you should both go home and re-familiarize yourself with the series.  Well, I don't.  Can we squeeze these Fox News clips in, or we got Bernard...  How long is he coming down the hall now?  He's here.  Where is he, though?  The other Fox clip.  All right, let's squeeze in these Fox clips really fast.  Fox and Friends, thanks.  It's...  Tragic.  That was incredible.  I have not laughed hard.  I mean, that was, you know, it was pretty good.  It is so inappropriate.  It was inappropriate for who? 
[01:13:30]  For the President of the United States to be sitting down with an interview that's a mock-up.  Someone argued that it's inappropriate for the President of the United States to be advertising a law, an insurance plan.  Well, the comedian was speaking truth to power, wasn't it?  The whole thing is a big mock-up.  I think it's pretty tragic.  I think it's pretty real.  Whoever recommended that he do that show should be fired.  That is...  You know what?  That's just ridiculous.  Just douchebags.  Right.  We have another clip from Fox, but we have Bernard Hopkins outside the studio. 
[01:14:00]  We're going to bring him in right now.  Oh, yeah?  And then we'll get back to the Zach Galifianakis.  That Obama thing from Funny or Die.  Here he comes.  Bernard Hopkins.  Welcome back to the show.  Hello, sir.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Take a seat there.  Pull up the microphone.  You look good, sir.  Pop on the headphones.  Not you, Jimmy.  I like that.  What's that?  Oh, Obama was shopping at the Gap yesterday.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  That's to save money.  Yeah, yeah, apparently.  Did you like the interview you did with Zach or no? 
[01:14:30]  Did you see the interview?  I didn't see that.  No, no.  I was just reading the paper.  Oh, okay.  But they had the town locked down for him and the traffic was...  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was brutal.  It was already kind of...  You know, a certain time of day is kind of crazy.  Yeah.  You know, you got important dignitaries from Ryan, it's good.  It really gets locked up.  Everyone has to, like, stop what they're doing until he leaves.  It's all right, though.  It could be worse, right?  Have you met him?  Once.  Where?  Yep.  He did speak to Independence Hall, and, you know, I had to pay $5,000 to do that, but it 
[01:15:00]  was there.  Oh, yeah.  It was just like a fundraiser, but it was real historic for me.  Five large, huh?  Yeah, it was, you know...  It's not that bad, actually.  Was it worth it?  Yeah, it was worth it.  Did you get to shake his hand?  No, I didn't get to shake his hand, but part of the history of it and being there and,  you know, you don't get a chance to even do that.  And that really had nothing to do with basically being African-American, just asking to be  with, like, what president of time where you get a chance to be in the same, you could 
[01:15:30]  say, facility, you know, in an area that a guy, I mean, you know, wherever it was this  person or that person.  To me, it was just something I could tell my son, who's two years old, beat three in  June, so I'd be able to tell him, you know, a long time ago, you know, those old stories.  Why didn't you meet?  Like, why didn't you get a picture?  Like, maybe you have to pay more for per plate?  Yeah, it's probably like...  You have to do that, but actually, you know, I got a free felony, so I don't think they'll  let me know close to him.  You know how that goes.  Because you got a felony?  Really? 
[01:16:00]  They check the background, so a certain part of the rope, you can't go by.  But you're a Bernard Hopkins.  Yeah, he probably likes you.  But you're a Bernard Hopkins.  I'm sure he knows who you are.  Those guys are really on their job.  They don't play.  They don't play.  You can have a parking ticket, and if you ain't paid a ticket, you might get arrested.  Right.  Oh, I didn't think of that.  Do you think...  No, because...  It's pretty deep.  I mean, it's just like, you know...  But athletes have gone there before, like football teams.  Whenever they win the Super Bowl, the whole team goes.  Yeah, the whole NBA.  I mean, come on.  They all go to NBC.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  But, you know, it's cool.  I got to be 100 yards away from them. 
[01:16:30]  100 yards.  100 yards.  You're Bernard Hopkins.  200 yards.  Maybe 200.  Maybe 200.  But that was good, though.  I mean, it was cool.  It was good.  It was a good experience for me.  Yeah.  You know, a little donation.  There you go.  Right?  You know, for the cause.  For the cause.  So, what's up?  What's up, everybody?  I mean, you know...  Hey, what's up, Bernard?  I don't know about you.  Yeah, 45.  You're 45?  Yeah.  You look good for your age.  Thank you, Bernard.  You must duck a lot here on this station.  I certainly do.  You be talking a lot of stuff, boy.  You got a lot of guards when you leave out this building? 
[01:17:00]  I do.  I have one big guy that walks out.  Yeah.  He's right.  Yeah.  I have a big mouth.  I'm paying attention.  Thank you.  Yeah, we can't take care of ourselves.  We're...  Yeah.  We, you know.  Yeah.  I have a guy that I travel with.  Opie is a guy.  Anthony has a gun.  So, we're all good.  You heard a thing with the story about the, you know, only way you get a bad guy is with  a gun, huh?  So, you got to have a gun.  Right.  Well, there you go.  You know. 
[01:17:30]  All legal.  Yeah.  You got to be all legit.  Sometimes you got to, you know, think of your life and your family life.  Exactly.  Right.  There's a lot of controversy about that, but, you know, if you're responsible and you  understand, you know, I pay attention, not only just to boxing, but, you know, life  in general, because when it's over with, I still got to return, which I'm at here in  society.  So, I think everybody should be granted to protect themselves.  How long, you know, how much longer you think you'll be able to box?  Well, I really take it by fight by fight because, you know, the last fight doesn't dictate what's 
[01:18:00]  going to happen for the next one because, you know, we don't know.  But I know I'll be ready and I'll be energized to win another title and become the  undisputed lightweight champion of the world.  That's more focused to me.  As far as, like, trying to plan when and where and who, you know, but one thing I know is  clear that, you know, if I don't come through at this stage of my boxing long career and 
[01:18:30]  really been like this for the last two or three years, then maybe it won't be up to me whether  I'm retired because they'll retire me.  Well, you're 49 now.  That makes sense.  They'll retire me.  They'll ask for my head, basically, in a good way, not in a bad way.  I know that sounds kind of harsh, like, but it'd be a thing where, like, come on, man,  you're almost 50, didn't look good.  I mean, winning and not looking good is losing for me.  So, again, look at all this extra pressure and extra incentive that I got to go and perform, 
[01:19:00]  not just at a level of saying, hey, man, Scott's 49 years old, but he barely won, man.  Just give him applause.  I got to still add some excitement and some over-the-top performance, even at this age.  So I raised the bar real high on myself to not fall asleep, to not get lowered into, you  know, Shcherbinoff.  You know, whether people know him well or know him halfway or whatever the case is, I must take  this guy serious because it's about me, really not about him. 
[01:19:30]  He has something I want, and that is the title.  You want to unify them.  He has a title, yes.  And I'm in the same position that I was 13, 14 years.  My math is correct.  2001, 9-11 here.  In New York City, when I beat Felix Tito, I became the undisputed middleweight champion,  which is not done in boxing since the old days.  They got away from that.  You know what I mean?  Because now it's about, you know, so many belts in one division.  So I get a chance to be the undisputed lightweight champion, which has never been done before. 
[01:20:00]  14-plus years later, I mean, at 50.  Now, I'm 49 as of January 15th, 1965.  But I'm harping on that 50 because I want people to understand the milestone of halftime  in anyone's life, whether you box, whether you're a radio announcer, whatever you do,  when you reach 50, you sort of, or should, reflect all the things that you accomplish  in the halftime of your life. 
[01:20:30]  What, at 50 years old, like to fight?  That's how I look at it.  Light heavyweight, what is the weight on that?  175.  Okay, so is it easier for you to go up at this point, go up in weight?  You mean go up, like go up higher than that?  No, no, no, like what do you weigh now?  Because I'm...  185.  And, well, middleweight's like what, like 150, 160?  160.  And I was there for 12 years.  So is it a little easier now to fight a little bit heavier because you don't have to cut  all that weight?  Well, I never had a problem cutting weight anyway because of my lifestyle.  I was known for, matter of fact, they were saying, how can I get up the 175? 
[01:21:00]  You remember I jumped up two weight classes to fight Antonio Tarver?  And I was a 6-1 underdog in Atlantic City because I made 20 defenses, and I've been  at middleweight 13, 12 years.  Now you're going up past 68, which is super middleweight, 168, in the middle of middleweight  and light heavyweight.  You could jump in a two-weight class, which is, you know, rarely people do that in boxing,  in any era.  And I went up two weight classes.  And that gave everybody a blueprint to say, and justifiably, yeah, well, Bernard, you're 
[01:21:30]  biting off too much you can chew.  You find Antonio Tarver just knocked out Roy Jones Jr., you know, light heavyweights  walking around at 205 to 200.  I mean, you've been making 160 and barely get up eight pounds over your weight.  So they thought one way, but I knew another way.  I knew I got the height.  I got the body structure.  And, you know, I know that being 175 or weighing 175 wouldn't take anything away from me. 
[01:22:00]  If anything, it would probably make me stronger.  The speed would not go away.  And I'd be faster than a bigger guy that's coming down from 200 to 75.  Then I'm coming up from 60 to 75.  Do you see the difference?  Yes.  Because my speed will still be there compared to a light heavyweight who walks around as  a cruiserweight to a heavyweight.  So he's coming down on my weight, melting down his body.  And I'm coming up a few pounds.  And that's where the IQ, the experience, same thing, and the youth that I bring with the 
[01:22:30]  40-plus-year-old is going to neutralize anything that Shumanoff, April 19th on Showtime, is  going to try to do and anybody else after that.  You talk about all these, the training for the fights, and a lot of your later fights have  gone the distance.  And you testified, I guess, or talked in the Senate about brain injuries in boxing.  And just listening to you talk, it's like you're 49, and it's like you sound like any  other 49-year-old.  How do you avoid any problems and so many fighters wind up messed up? 
[01:23:00]  Don't let that fool you.  I'm not normal.  Well, yeah, that's probably a bad term to use.  Exactly.  Hey, listen.  I did speak in D.C.  I was representing not only Golden Boy, but the sport of boxing and injuries, period.  Soccer, any other contact sport that deal with the head.  But I believe that no matter how good you are, defense, offense, whatever, I believe  it's going to be some effects later in life. 
[01:23:30]  I really believe that.  I want to know early.  That's why I volunteer after the schedule clear up to be one of the premier known guys  in boxing to sign up for it.  And I will in Cleveland.  Will they test you?  They will test me.  Because I want to know.  Listen, I want to be able to get things in order.  You understand what I'm saying?  First, my money.  I wish I could get that in order.  And who get what, even though that's established now.  But, you know, some changes as time goes on.  Friends.  Look, people that's there now might not be on that wheel two years from now. 
[01:24:00]  You know how things are.  You know what they're going to ask you to sign something when you're a little loopy.  Exactly.  A little loopy.  Or on a couch with a straw.  You know what I'm saying?  They're talking about, okay, darling.  But these are the things that I'm not, listen, I'm not afraid of.  I know it's serious.  And, you know, we all have a lot of humor to continue to move forward, even in the downtowns of my life.  But, yeah, I mean, this is something that I know that's the risk.  This is something that I know that could be a major problem if you look at fighters that came before me. 
[01:24:30]  Most of them.  I can speak about the ones I see in Philly.  Like Meldrick Keller.  Meldrick and Saad Matthew Franklin, Saad Muhammad.  But this is, look, the brain has, man as great as man has came over the years and years on this earth,  having came up with a solution of a transplant brain.  So you only get one.  And as we know, as of today, 2014, there's no breaking news that somebody survived after a brain transplant. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  You understand what I'm saying?  So I understand the risk, but I also realize you only get one.  For right now, we only get one.  Have you noticed any difference now?  I mean, aside from, like, we all get a little bit older, but have you noticed anything different now than, say, 15 years ago?  Like, do you forget things now?  Because George St. Pierre retired, I think, out of UFC because he was having some memory issues.  Well, I think when you, as you, first of all, I'm not having, like, memory issues, but I know I've misplaced this, misplaced that. 
[01:25:30]  And you've got to sort of define whether you misplaced it, you're moving too fast, you're rushing, you've got too much on your mind.  So you get to say all that, and some of it could be denial of you've got too much on your mind, that's why you forgot.  But, no, you don't leave a running car all night in the garage, you know what I mean?  Right.  You're upstairs, and you're wondering where your damn keys is at.  You understand what I'm saying?  Right.  Now, yes, have I left my keys in the ignition and not have the car running and got out the car grabbing bags and leave and come back.  And I can't find my damn keys. 
[01:26:00]  And you go and you see your keys in the ignition, but the car has been cut off.  Right.  Stuff like that.  Now, I don't know what to take into that, you know, or whatever, but when you start remembering, or not remembering, not remembering, say, your kid's birthday, you start, you know, things that you know you're supposed to remember.  Where you live.  Right.  You understand that?  Yeah.  I don't have that problem.  That's when you know you've got to, well, I think that's when it's too late, almost, to the point where, like, wait a minute, like, nobody's spotted this.  So someone close to you, right, wife, girlfriend, friend, trainers, they have to pay attention not with the check you're paying them, right? 
[01:26:30]  They have to pay attention to the fighter.  And the fighter has to be honest in themselves and say, look, I'm not the same or something's wrong.  We know.  You know.  You know something's wrong.  Men, we tough things out.  But after a while, most of us be like, wait a minute, I'm having these pains.  It's more than two days.  I got a problem. 
[01:27:00]  And they go get it checked out.  So, so.  But the money's too good.  The money's too good, so it makes it hard for people that are depending on someone like you to go, hey, Bernard, I don't know.  Yeah, I think it's, I think for some.  Yeah.  But for most people that need to do something, it's, and you're right, most things, I will hate to be in a position where I have to do something because.  Right, you don't have to fight anymore.  Exactly.  When you have to do something because you ignore a lot of things, because you have to.  No matter what nobody say, you, look, there's your box again, such and such, you know, it's, it's getting, most people under certain circumstances be like, wait a minute, I got my mortgage, I got my kids, I got this, I got that, I got alimony, I got this. 
[01:27:30]  You understand, you understand, there's a lot of things, why people do things, whether that's justified or not, bad or good, bad or good.  So I see these things as a luxury for me.  But being 49 years old, people get to bring it up, and they should, a lot of things surrounding when you're almost 50 and you're still doing this on a high level. 
[01:28:00]  And I understand the curiosity.  But the curiosity has been the way I've been so disciplined and focused in lifestyle that I've boldly, I'm used the word bragged about. 
[01:28:30]  Because I know that it's not done all the time and often, especially being disciplined enough to continue to do it, even in a highlight of your life and your career, whether it's basketball, football, hockey, everything.  I got all kinds of athletes coming up to me and saying, yo, man, you doing this thing, man, like this, in a drug culture, where if somebody's doing something and they're swinging at a ball at a baseball game and the ball breaks, splits in half and explode, it's a problem. 
[01:29:00]  And you're doing this thing, and then they say, man, I remember back in the day, they start talking about, I remember in the 90s, I remember watching the 2000s.  Man, I'm running track with these dudes in Temple University in Philadelphia.  And they're half my age, man.  They're like, yo.  Now, sometimes I get them and sometimes I don't, but I'm not dust.  They don't leave me in the dust.  I'm on their heels.  Cardio is so, it's 70% of my training. 
[01:29:30]  Because how young guy, how young guy, how young guy, how do a young guy be putting on Hopkins?  Okay, well, you got to be talented.  Okay, I mean, that doesn't mean necessarily a win.  If I'm fighting a guy and he's 49 years old and I'm 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, I'm counting backwards to prove a point.  But I'm going to jump on that old man and make that old car, right, like a car, right, go faster and run that engine quicker and harder than he want to. 
[01:30:00]  Like the boat in Jaws.  Yes.  He guns it as hard as he can and then the boat quits.  Yes.  Now, the boat quits.  Boats get tired.  The boats get the grab.  So now you got these.  So I know their plan.  If I'm 29 years old and I'm fighting an almost 50-year-old guy, I'm not going to box him.  I mean, come on.  How ridiculous that is.  Here I'm half his age.  Tie him out.  I'm running from him.  No, I'm going to put pressure on you.  I'm going to make you use cardio. 
[01:30:30]  And I'm going to see, can you withstand, right, that intensity for 12 rounds?  And once that happens and they realize that I'm not breathing like they're breathing, the mental effect kicks in.  Right.  And they say, wait a minute.  Then you kick their ass.  Sis, the trainers become liars to the fighter because the fighter has been told all through camp, and even in the corner of when the fight is taking place, that somehow I am going to die out. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  99% of what I do is mental, the sport.  You can ask any great basketball, football player.  We know how to do the motions of what we do.  I've been doing this almost three decades, 1988, doing the math.  I'm going to teach you.  You're going to tell me what style haven't I saw in boxing or seen in boxing? 
[01:31:30]  What style?  I mean, what are you talking about?  So when a young guy, and a young guy is 30 to me, that's still young to me.  If I'm fighting a guy, this guy is 30 years old.  Right?  The last three or four guys was in their 20s.  Right?  I'm kind of disappointed, but when they think about the initial shock and then the adjustments that they can make, that's when you sit there and ring side on TV and say, damn, he's ready to do this again. 
[01:32:00]  You can tell around the four, even though the fight's not over, because anything can happen between four and eight, 12.  But when you start seeing a pattern of the things that I've been doing over the years and you start saying, wait a minute, I'm going to see it with this old guy because I just had to be 40 because I got a movement.  I really got a movement in the world with the 40 and up club.  Mm-hmm.  And they're sitting back out of curiosity.  If it's pay-per-view, they'll buy it.  If it's regular TV, which this fight is, April 19th on Showtime, they're going to watch it. 
[01:32:30]  And they're going to root for me based on the age, even not liking me.  And they're going to say, wait a minute, I've seen this before.  He's got this young guy actually doing what he wants him to do.  It really, it's for anyone in their 40s, just to see a guy in 49 beating the shit out of somebody 20 years younger, there's just something satisfying about that.  Of course.  There's some morale in that because most 40-year-olds in any corporate America is always dreadful of that young intern.  Coming up.  To replace you. 
[01:33:00]  Mm-hmm.  And that's the way the game goes.  That's the way the game's going.  That's all of us.  So if you don't keep your numbers up, if you don't keep your numbers up, so I'm going to say ratings, same damn thing, then guess what?  This new job, this new girl, right, who just happened to be 20 years younger, if y'all listening, keep your game up.  That means walk Central Park every now and then.  Put the donut, put one donut down, ease your way down to no donuts.  And guess what? 
[01:33:30]  Those hips will come back.  That stomach, you'll get a four-pack, maybe not a six, but you'll be hanging in there.  But there's got to be there.  See, these are these things that people got to know to make those adjustments.  There's been boxers that have been just as dedicated and have trained themselves, but for some reason they couldn't make it to 49, 50 years old fighting.  What do you attribute that to?  How did you, how are you still competitive?  Now we're getting somewhere.  Yeah.  Yes, we are.  I'm an alien. 
[01:34:00]  I'm a fucking alien.  Maybe you can tell us where that plane went.  I'm an alien.  Yeah.  The aliens got it.  That's what I say, Bernard.  The aliens got it.  Let's do this.  I think it's a game changer.  What are you talking about?  I mean, people are getting crazy for them.  I mean, this is, I don't want to stand the aliens.  There's aliens out there.  I don't doubt it.  This, this, this, I'm telling you, I have a family out.  There's an alien.  I'm from the world.  I'm of the world, but I'm not from the world.  The aliens.  You said the aliens, right?  And I haven't heard you say that, but I'm telling you right now. 
[01:34:30]  No, I said it earlier, and I've said it the last few days.  Well, I'm saying it now.  The aliens took that plane.  I just got in 10, 15 minutes ago.  Yeah.  And the aliens got the plane.  Could you see if tomorrow, like, he comes out as an alien, and it's true, and we're  just sitting there like, yeah.  Yeah, watch him be right, and he gets the big headline.  And we don't get it.  Where's the aliens?  Where's the plane now, though?  Mars.  Mars.  Damn.  But we got a thing on Mars.  We would see it.  Yeah, we have a rover.  We have a rover on Mars.  Well, maybe they went to the other side, though. 
[01:35:00]  It's more than one side, right?  It's a big planet, right?  It's a cover a lot.  That is true.  It's a big planet.  It is.  Big planet.  They know not to go to Pluto, because there's no more planet.  Right.  That's true.  Plus, it's too long of a trip.  It is.  It's cold.  You're going to fight at 50, right?  That's the big one.  The huge one.  5-0 is very important.  But that would be a huge pay-per-view.  Bernard Hopkins fighting at 50.  And you know what would be good?  I'm saying I'm going to throw something out there, and I know you all heard it before,  whether it's realistic or not, but just have fun with it, because something fun could 
[01:35:30]  become real.  Can you imagine?  Just use your imagination.  I don't believe anybody's going to be Floyd Mayweather in the next two fights.  He's 47-0, right?  So he fights two fights, and he's 49-0.  I get passed.  She went off.  I become the Undisputed.  Maybe fight Adonis Davidson, dangerous puncher, who just signed with Al Heyman, which is slash.  So we got the guy that beat the man, that beat the man, that's Adonis Davidson, that's 
[01:36:00]  the light heavyweight, the on paper, the guy to beat at the light heavyweight champion.  Okay.  50-50.  Can Mayweather, after two more fights, provide and I win, and I become the Undisputed Light  Heavyweight Champion of the world.  You got all this drama leading up to the big comics of the event.  49-0 versus almost 50.  50-50 is the name of the fight.  That's it.  You listen.  50-50 is the name of the fight. 
[01:36:30]  Can he break Marciano or tie Marciano's record?  It'll be breaking.  I think Marciano got four.  Okay.  Right.  50-50.  What's 50-50?  Bernard be 50.  And he wants to be 50.  He wants to have 50 wins.  Right.  And then Time Magazine will probably have me as a third athlete ever.  Ali Jordan on a cover.  Time Heaven beat Bernard Hopkins.  Nice.  With 50. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  And I'm in the middle with all my belts.  But you won't be on the cover if Aliens took that plane.  Well, I put my mask on.  I beat the Aliens representing the Aliens.  I got an Aliens mask.  So the Aliens, I'll be the Aliens.  Because I don't have to take the picture with my handsome face.  I'll be the Aliens with the green mask on like y'all seen last fight.  Yeah.  And I will come out with another mask come April 19th on Showtime.  And this, see, how, I'm sitting here having a conversation with y'all about the future at 49 years old. 
[01:37:30]  Mm-hmm.  Because I am looking forward to playing out my plan like I did in my lifetime, as y'all know.  Mm-hmm.  But that's not dangerous.  You're not looking past this fight.  In my plan, well, I'm not looking past, but I am looking for the future to be motivated to know I have something to fight for.  Right.  See, the game changes in courses of the career of most fighters or most athletes because I got to at least look to the future, but smart enough and wise enough to understand that I do have something on plate now. 
[01:38:00]  I do have something on hand now.  There's nothing wrong with looking for the future.  Right.  You just can't dwell on the past.  And so my objective is like, look, to be Shilmanov, young, European fighter, strong, common, European style.  And that means something when you're fighting an orthodox type of guy like myself because the styles can confuse each guy. 
[01:38:30]  And who adjusts quick will be the one who wins the fight.  Now, because we have Adonis Stevenson right there at radar because under the same advisor, Al Heyman, it makes it easier now since we have the man that beat the man, which was Chad Dawson with one punch in 50-something seconds, Adonis Stevenson. 
[01:39:00]  That was a quick one.  Now, the reality of, Bernard, you chasing this light heavyweight unification, the buildup for that now is realistic, not maybe because the Cold War a couple of months ago would have kept that from even being a conversation this morning.  Sure.  But now, since we have the most important piece of the light heavyweight division, Adonis Superman Stevenson, now the headline for the last two weeks, as you've probably seen or whatever, is like, wow, wait a minute. 
[01:39:30]  Do this means?  And then, and then just so happen, we have Shilinoff under Al Heyman.  So the pieces.  Coming together.  Have came together.  There you go.  Has boxing been hurt?  And thanks to Al Heyman, one of the smartest, brilliant guys.  And I've been in the game 27 years before him. 
[01:40:00]  I remember a good friend of mine named Vernon Forrest from Atlanta.  Yes, who was shot pumping gas in his car in Atlanta.  And I remember Vernon Forrest mentioning a name, Al Heyman.  I didn't know.  I didn't know Al Heyman exists, to be honest with you.  But I got to know him, and I got to in and out, he represented Jermaine Teller, who beat me by a split decision for the middleweight, stopped my middleweight range of 20 defenses. 
[01:40:30]  And we fought twice, me and Jermaine Teller.  But anyway, I got to know him for a long time, and I respect him.  He's one of his brightest, smartest guys out there and gets you the most for your talent.  Do you think boxing takes too long sometimes to get to the fights people want?  Like you said, all these things lined up.  And one thing UFC has done fairly well is give guys a lot of quick matchups that they really want to see.  And boxing seems to take a little bit longer to do that.  Well, not in Goldenboy's side, because if you watch the fights lately with Goldenboy, 
[01:41:00]  and we've been accused of throwing guys in, they might say the word throwing guys in or putting guys in too soon, too early,  and not making them blossom to become pay-per-view or whatever stars that boxing seems to want to dress things up,  but then when it comes to show who you really are, they fail.  We want to go and put the best against the best so you can see a champion fight a champion.  The lightweight division wasn't even talked about 28 months ago. 
[01:41:30]  Think about it.  All of a sudden, the lightweight division became some interest of a lot of people,  and I just happened to be in it.  But back to your statement is absolutely correct.  You can't blame the MMA or the UFC and those guys like that and Dana White and them,  who I highly respect.  And I wasn't a US3 fan.  I mean, I talked, you know, you heard me loud and clear.  I got to know a couple of guys. 
[01:42:00]  I got to see how they train.  They train at Johan's Gym in Philadelphia.  I'm right next to them.  I've also been to a couple of matches.  It's a different sport.  It's a different way of technique.  They deserve the respect.  The numbers speak for itself.  You can't deny the numbers.  It is what it is.  They gained a lot of fans.  They took a lot of fans from the boxing program because, well, boxing sport,  because they stepped their game up,  and they matched the tough guys against the tough guys,  the good guys against the good guys. 
[01:42:30]  It wasn't no mismatch.  It wasn't no rubber match.  This was something that didn't need to happen to put pressure on the boxing world,  business guys, to say,  y'all better step up or we're going to take all y'all fans.  And that's the threat that we needed.  Boxing needed.  They said that they gave us the, do you have to leave?  Do you have other press, I guess, to do?  Okay.  Okay.  I'm going to be here all day.  Very busy.  You're one of my favorite people.  Yeah.  Bernard's fighting April 19th live on Showtime. 
[01:43:00]  And how do you say his first name?  Shcherbinoff's last name.  Shcherbinoff.  Shcherbinoff.  Okay, yeah.  He's fighting Shcherbinoff.  And it's the Light Heavyweight World Championship Unification.  And, again, Saturday, April 19th.  It's on Showtime.  And it's from D.C.  And the real B-Hop is Bernard on Twitter.  And you're just, you're amazing, man.  You're just an amazing guy.  Thank you.  Yeah, come back and see us.  It's been too long.  What's up with you?  And I'll make sure that when I come back that, you know, my speech will be just the same.  Good for you, man.  See, ducking is so important to me because I understand that counting your money first 
[01:43:30]  means that you can count the same last.  Right.  You know, because I did two minutes of cardio yesterday, and I got very tired during the  Jacob's Ladder thing.  Oh, shimmy.  Yeah, we'll discuss cardio after that.  You look tired even talking about cardio.  Yeah, I really am.  I think you're going to say I look good because I've been working out, but I look tired.  You're right.  Fair enough.  Good point.  He's got to go.  He's got to go. 
[01:44:00]  Listen.  Uh-oh.  I might as well give it to you before I leave.  You look terrible.  Thank you.  I'm going to make sure I send a pre-spot to 1 o'clock.  Oh, Jimmy.  The great Bernard Hopkins, everyone.  Oh, yeah, we're back.  I want to thank Bernard Hopkins for stopping by.  Some people didn't like it.  I love Bernard Hopkins.  I was just reading through Twitter.  I'm shocked, but maybe I'm just totally out of fucking step with what people like at  this point.  I really love this guy.  Love him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think people, you know, they didn't get everything he was saying. 
[01:44:30]  It's very inside with boxing and some of the things.  Like, there were names that he was mentioning, and I'm like, I don't even know.  It doesn't even sound familiar, the name.  I like the man.  But, yeah.  Don't forget, it's Opie and Anthony Podcast Day.  Every Wednesday, you go and get our podcast right.  It's about an hour, hour and a half every week.  Yeah.  And this week, we brought it up.  Snooping Kids is this week's Opie and Anthony Podcast. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, boy.  They're a problem.  Yeah.  Instead of redoing the bit, which is very, very hard these days, we got enough audio of  times when we did it correctly.  So, it's basically kids going through their parents' night tables and stuff and dressers and finding  really, really strange stuff.  Yeah.  It's very, very funny.  So, go get that.  For bragging rights, go through iTunes if you can, because that's where everyone is paying  attention to the numbers.  It's where everyone goes. 
[01:45:30]  So, if you have a choice, go through iTunes.  If you don't, that's fine, too.  Just go get it, okay?  That's why it's out there.  The Opie and Anthony Podcast.  This week, it's Snooping Kids.  Yeah, that was fun.  They go through the drawers and find all kinds of embarrassing things that their parents are  using.  Yeah.  Dildos.  Dildo.  Fuck toys.  You just don't want to find mom's fuck toys.  You don't want to find your mommy's fuck toys. 
[01:46:00]  I remember when we did the bit originally, where the parents would be calling up, because  they're the real fans of the show.  Sure.  Panicking.  Yeah, yeah.  Praying that the kid, their kid who was still home, wasn't listening to the radio show.  And going through their drawers.  Yeah.  So, looking for those fuck toys.  Mom's fuck toys.  That should be the name of a band.  Oh, yeah.  The Fuck Toys.  With special guests. 
[01:46:30]  Boston.  What?  Does Boston have a new album?  I don't know.  The singer's been dead, so I don't know how they could possibly.  I heard some kind of a promo, I think, where they're celebrating Tom Schultz.  Yeah.  His birthday or something.  They got tracks.  I don't know.  What's going on with Boston?  Is it old tracks that they're bringing back for Bradley Delp singing?  Or is it some guy that sounds like him?  I bet you they just said, screw it, we can move on without Brad Delp.  He had a very unique, high voice.  Very, I don't think it's that easy to replace. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  You know?  So, can you find out, Travis, if there's new Boston and if there's a song out there ready?  I thought it was just taking this long for them to put out their next album.  You know, because, remember?  Fucking cool day.  Take a long time to put out their albums.  And plus it was because he fell asleep on a hibachi.  Hibachi.  We got one more clip from Fox News, everyone.  Now you've got to remember what we did a little while ago.  Remember the Zach Galifianakis?  Zach Galifianakis.  Wow. 
[01:47:30]  Zach Galifianakis interviewing Obama.  We just played the audio before Bernard Hopkins.  And we played one clip from Fox saying it's a tragedy.  It's tragic that Obama would do this with Zach Galifianakis and Funny or Die.  And then O'Reilly got involved.  O'Reilly.  Your boy O'Reilly.  He's my boy?  What happened?  You love O'Reilly, don't you?  I don't think I do.  You sure?  I know it's the no spin zone.  Caution.  You're entering the no spin zone.  The no spin zone.  As you get dizzy watching that show. 
[01:48:00]  Spinning.  But when Bush was pretending to look for weapons of mass destruction at the White House  correspondence dinner, then liberals criticized him and conservatives were like, oh, you know,  it's the spare.  They're just, God, they're just all so full of shit.  I mean, I watched the clip of Zach Galifianakis.  It was funny.  I thought there was some funny parts in it.  It turned me around.  I'm no fan of Barack Obama, believe me.  But I'm not going to try to find something to bitch about just because he's involved in it. 
[01:48:30]  So you really didn't have much of a problem with it?  No, no, no.  On principle.  It's kind of funny.  Okay.  Yeah.  But Fox, I guess that's what you got to do there.  You got to find something.  Yeah.  I mean, think about it.  Why couldn't they just go on?  It'd be so refreshing.  You turn on Fox and they go, I did this thing with Zach.  And you know what?  I got to be honest with you.  I don't like him and his policies.  But that was kind of funny and pretty brave of him to do.  Why would that be bad to say?  Fucking Operation Rolling Thunder is blasting North Vietnam apart. 
[01:49:00]  And Nixon's doing a sock it to me.  I'm laughing.  Who gives a shit?  I don't understand why you can't just do that.  But instead, you get this from O'Reilly.  I don't really have a problem with it in general.  But I...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  But there was a but there.  This is the whole but thing that we were talking about last week.  There's a but.  You guys had a really good show, but...  Yep.  Bye.  I think the timing hurts Mr. Obama.  The economy continues to be problematic and poof. 
[01:49:30]  The timing doesn't hurt Obama, right?  Why does the timing hurt him?  It doesn't matter.  And you could say that about any time the president is being the president.  Right.  Like, well, you know, it's probably not a good time.  There's always a crisis or some bullshit happening.  Yeah, there's not.  Yeah.  He doesn't have one day of rest as the president.  There's always something going on.  If we're waiting for Obama to come back with an economic recovery, he wouldn't be allowed  to do anything.  Because I don't think it's happening. 
[01:50:00]  That was a slam.  It was a slam.  It was.  I've got to be honest with you.  Stop whining and crying and pitching a fit.  I'm getting over it.  All right.  Good.  The economy continues to be problematic and Putin is clearly testing.  I fucking hate O'Reilly.  And he just talks down to everybody.  You obviously don't know as much as I do.  So let me explain this to you.  Oh, I hate his delivery.  Always have.  Do you think Putin watched that and laughed, though? 
[01:50:30]  Look.  Putin what is butt?  Putin.  Is that a picture of Putin meeting Reagan real when Putin was a kid or something?  People say it wasn't him as a kid.  It was the guy standing next to the kid with a camera around his neck.  How old was he?  That's supposed to be him.  I'm like, uh, he's 20, sir.  I always thought it was the kid.  I thought it was the kid, and I was trying to, like, do the math.  No, it's the adult next to him with the blonde hair.  Up there.  That's Putin?  Yeah, he was a KGB.  Can you, uh, can you zoom in on that? 
[01:51:00]  That's Putin.  He was KGB back then.  He's a connected fucking guy in Russia, man.  Oh, this guy is fucking...  Yeah, that's him.  Come on.  With the camera?  Yep.  That's him.  No, it doesn't.  Well, he doesn't have hair now.  Right.  And, um...  He looks Russian.  But that's the same face.  Doesn't look like Putin.  He just looks like a Russian.  Yeah, okay.  He really fucking has, uh...  Is he saying it's real or fake?  Uh, they're denying everything.  They are?  No comment, really.  Why no comment?  Well, you know.  He's just mad that he didn't have his shirt off in front of Reagan.  Very secretive. 
[01:51:30]  He looks kind of gay with the camera.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh!  I'm doing the fruity hand.  Hi!  Ah, Ronnie!  He's probably snapping pictures for fucking KGB.  Right.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  They knew what Reagan looked like.  What do they need a picture of him?  Yes.  Hello?  Here's my colon.  Why would he say that?  I know.  I would have shown.  I wouldn't.  All right, Jesus.  At between two ferns? 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I really got to turn the TVs off in here.  Eric in Westchester.  Eric.  Eddie?  Hey, what's up?  Okay.  All right.  We're taking calls?  I want to ask Opie a question, actually, about the show.  And it's just yesterday he kind of mentioned that he only says this, that he wants to end  the show because, like, there's nothing much to do.  And I feel like it's kind of disrespectful to Jimmy and Anthony because they work really  hard.  And I was wondering why he keeps saying that. 
[01:52:30]  This is a stupid question.  If I leave the show tomorrow, these guys will be fine no matter what.  So what's your point?  Well, no, I'm not saying it like that.  I'm saying you keep saying...  First of all, I don't keep saying it.  Every once in a while, I do.  But...  Well, no, yeah, and...  And we've been at this 20 years, so, yeah, what else are we supposed to do?  Does that mean the show's going to end in October?  I don't think so.  He's going to be tweeting, this guy.  Of course he will.  He's a tweet.  He's just some loser with some dumb Twitter account.  Anything else, Eric? 
[01:53:00]  Okay, then forget it.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Anything can happen.  Want the show to continue growing, that's for sure.  Certainly.  There is a fucking issue going on.  But no matter who leaves this radio show, the other guys will be fine.  What do you mean it's disrespectful?  These guys will be just fine, no matter what happens.  Relax.  It's a lot of talent in this room.  They'll figure it out. 
[01:53:30]  And then there's Sam Roberts.  Exactly.  Let's get back to...  New kid on the block.  He's getting his fucking first gray little beard hairs.  Does he have gray in there?  No, but it's coming.  Oh, it will be.  Fucking dummy over here thinks he's this fucking apple, fucking sheet, fresh face.  Fresh face kid.  Who are you?  In the neighborhood.  A fucking decade later, he's in a big bald spot.  I can't believe they don't like me more.  Wow, Sam getting ripped apart over here. 
[01:54:00]  That's not really a ripping.  A little bit.  Not really.  A little bit.  Accurate age happens.  But how is something disrespectful?  If you've been out of 20 years, I think you put in your time like you made it good for  everybody and it would be disrespectful if we had something going on and we moved to Boston  and I said, all right, you know what, I don't feel like giving this a shot.  Or say, I'm going to be moving.  Right.  I didn't let you know, but I'm moving on.  I think after 20 years, it's not disrespectful anymore.  I think we've carved out a niche and good careers for everybody here. 
[01:54:30]  To the point where we'll all move on and do our own thing eventually.  I mean, that's just how things...  That's just how it goes.  The listeners have proven over the years to not have much insight on what goes on behind  the scenes of this show.  I've never read more inaccurate tweets and posts and everything else as to what is going  on behind the scenes and with management and speculation as to what this means or that  means.  They're 99% wrong. 
[01:55:00]  One guy wrote yesterday, said, you guys would get a lot more respect if you stuck around after  the show and did meetings.  Would we?  You don't know anything.  And who said that?  Well, he does know that we don't do meetings.  He wasn't 100% wrong.  But, I mean, I guess I am talking about it now.  I didn't even acknowledge this idiot's tweet.  But the fact is, we stopped doing meetings because we were doing it with people that had  no fucking idea or clue about how the show worked. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  It was a complete and utter waste of time.  Waste of time.  And we've already done meetings with Tim Sabian because, you know, we respect the guy.  So we're, you know, we probably will do more meetings than we have in the past.  Yeah, we do meetings.  What a waste of fucking time that was.  Nothing ever got accomplished.  I mean, you know, our guys are great.  They'll play the game in those meetings.  But to sit there and listen to, man, if one of the guys left, it just wouldn't work. 
[01:56:00]  Well, there you go.  Whatever.  I'm not planning on leaving.  But the reality is, I mean, we don't have another 20 years.  20 years.  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  We've done 20.  Push for 40.  No one gets to do 20 years with the same nucleus of a radio show.  It's very, very rare.  I know.  They're going for me.  I'm on my way out.  Yeah.  The stuff that you're missing in the meetings are things such as Roland getting scolded 
[01:56:30]  because every time Eric looks away, he's flipping him off.  Oh, really?  I think if we do another five, that would be freaking huge.  Five, though.  Yeah.  That seems a lot at this point.  Five is a long time.  See?  Thank you, Jimmy.  It's a long time.  So there you go.  Jimmy backed me up.  After a while, you just know, you know, how much longer can we do all this?  Hey, what was Sal doing kicking Denny out of the office on that video? 
[01:57:00]  Whatever it was, he's right.  Was he?  I don't know.  Sal and Denny don't get along, right?  Why not?  Does Sal resent Denny's head size?  I think Sal was out of line.  Let me see.  He ought to have a little respect for someone that's been in the business a lot longer than  he has.  Well, you think we should get Denny in here?  No.  I don't.  Why are you sure?  Five years is a long time.  We can make the five years seem like ten. 
[01:57:30]  Let's get Denny in here.  Yeah, exactly.  In one day.  Right.  Yeah, I didn't think it was very respectful of Sal.  I don't know what happened.  World War III.  I just knew Sam and his shenanigans started.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, that fight, I wasn't even in the building when it started.  Oh, boy.  So what happened?  Nice alibi.  I know.  And where is Sal?  And here comes Denny.  And Manny.  Denny!  He's way down the side.  Sal.  Love you, but don't miss you.  Look at him waltzing down with his dumb slack jeans. 
[01:58:00]  His jeans are pulled up a little too much and his shirt's tucked in.  There he is.  His jeans are too high.  How you doing, Dennis Falcone?  Hi, Dennis.  Gentlemen.  Can we do the O'Reilly clip real fast before we get into this?  Oh, I thought that was done.  Is that okay, Dennis?  Let's do that.  It's your show.  All right, why don't you leave then?  Come back in like 20 minutes.  Yeah.  No, seriously, leave.  Sal, seriously.  Just wait outside the door.  Oh, Sal's here too? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, you guys gather your thoughts, because obviously there's an issue between you two.  No, you don't want them talking outside, though.  Sal, you go down the hall or something.  Or Sal, you just sit on my lap and Denny, you go down the hall.  You go down the hall and get your fucking head enlarged.  Go separate ways.  That tiny little head.  His Doverman Pinscher head enrages me every time I see it.  It's like a fucking witch doctor got to him.  The guy from Serpent and the Rainbow blew something in his face.  And his dumb legs that got busted when he was a kid.  Exactly.  Like his fucking stupid military hairdo from the back.  His dumb fawn legs. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, cricket legs, I want to talk to you.  Get over here.  Did he get run over like ice skating or something?  No, he's walking home.  It's almost impossible, but I think he got run over actually ice skating.  Ice skating.  That's how, uh...  Hold on.  Let me say hi to Joe in Staten Island, and then we'll move on to everything else.  Joe, go ahead.  Yeah, that last call was full of shit.  Oh, nice.  Your show was great, but...  Of course it is.  Open Anthony of Faggots.  We never smoked weed in high school.  Oh, I remember that. 
[01:59:30]  They could have stopped after Faggots.  Should have ripped some bong hits and drank some beers.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Yeah, that's the problem.  That's the weed, bro.  What the fuck?  I think if we start ripping bong hits together, we could last another ten years.  Ripping some bong hits.  Thank you, Joe.  I'm not stupid.  I know the guy, you know, he likes the Jimmy and the Anthony.  It happens.  What are you going to do?  Here's Bill O'Reilly talking about Obama on Funny or Guy.  I don't really have a problem with it in general, but I think the timing hurts from Mr. Obama. 
[02:00:00]  The economy continues to be problematic, and Putin is clearly testing the president.  Clearly.  Looks like Putin believes the president is a lightweight.  Will a comedy video counter that?  Just asking.  Here's the most important thing.  The affordable health care act.  He's just a smug asshole.  The way he presents it, and then he goes, just asking.  How does he have fans?  It was dripping with sarcasm.  But how does he have fans?  He's a very high-rated program.  He's the big dick at Fox.  I mean, as far as the boss, yeah. 
[02:00:30]  But he's just a smug asshole.  That's why.  The affordable health care act is dubious, to say the least.  Dubious.  And using a comedic website to enroll people, it's a little bit desperate, don't you think?  Enroll, dubious.  Enroll, dubious.  I see a pattern, cattle.  Why is it desperate for Obama to go on Funny or Die?  That's where the younger people are going.  That's who he's trying to pitch his little law to.  It's a bit unorthodox, but what the hell? 
[02:01:00]  Exactly.  I mean, he was taking a risk.  This is a snarky guy.  Funny or Die?  Well.  I'm not a fan of Obamacare, but I understand why he might go in this direction to get people to pay attention to it.  Oh, he knows my insurance is, like, getting canceled.  Good.  I don't know what to do about it.  I mean, why?  I don't even know who to call, what to do.  Go on the website.  It's a way to fucking annoying.  But I liked my insurance.  I was told I could keep it.  Well, you know.  My sack of shit. 
[02:01:30]  What do you like about your insurance?  That I paid it, and if I ever needed to go to see the doctor, they paid for it.  There.  Nice.  Now I get maternity leave care and fucking children's orthodontics?  Yay!  In case you get DNA on their gums, you have to, Dennis, wash it off.  Wash it off.  Hey, could you get in there and get under the gums?  Get all that stuff out of there.  Wait, if yours is getting canceled, that mine's done too.  Really?  I didn't get anything. 
[02:02:00]  You must have already sent you a form.  I don't read those forms.  I got that.  Obie has a different thing, because you've got wife and kids, so maybe they fill his out differently.  Maybe it's a different insurance.  I sure hope so.  He probably has maternity leave.  You don't want to be uninsured.  Why?  I don't believe in insurance.  Something happens.  I'll just go to the doctors, and I say, look, I'll give you what I got.  Whatever.  I promise something.  I don't think I had health insurance until I was 30.  Seriously.  Me too.  I had it through my union, so I had it for quite a while.  Lucky me. 
[02:02:30]  Maybe.  Maybe 30.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah, because radio stations didn't offer health insurance.  Are you kidding me?  Ooh.  That's all recent.  Yeah.  It's a little bit desperate, don't you think?  I mean, I'm all for PR, and if Carney wanted to go on Funny or Die, fine.  But the President of the United States?  Stop it, Bill.  Shut up.  All I can tell you is Abe Lincoln would not have done it.  How much is the point?  Shut up.  Come on.  Serious times.  I've done it.  Yeah, but Obama wouldn't have gone to the theater without security.  So fucking shut up. 
[02:03:00]  And this is what we were talking about.  Serious times means serious actions.  Right.  You shouldn't be fooling around.  Like when Bush does the White House, and again, I'm not shitting on Bush, but like when  any president does the White House correspondence dinner, same time, Obama sat in that White House  correspondence dinner when he knew what Bin Laden was about to be captured in the day.  They all do it.  It's a part of the fucking job, so shut the fuck up about it.  And fucking Lincoln, he pulled the biggest joke on America. 
[02:03:30]  That should have been on Funny or Die.  Oh, that's hilarious, Lincoln.  Thanks.  I have to disagree with this.  It's just jokes.  Well, I was talking about the Gettysburg Address.  I understood.  It was great.  I was with you.  That's some solid stand-up right there.  We read each other's minds after all these years.  Exactly.  I know exactly what you were talking about.  Exactly.  Serious times call for serious action.  Oh, shut up.  We're a divided nation, which Talking Points believes is in decline. 
[02:04:00]  Mr. Obama's quick, has a good sense of humor.  Those are assets.  But he needs to be aware.  He needs to be aware of how his enemies perceive him.  Because I believe the testing of America is just getting started.  Stop it.  I don't dreck you.  I don't dreck you.  All right.  Coming up.  Sounds like it was spinning to me.  That was spinning.  He loves a good spin.  Gotta be political.  All right.  Now we can bring in Denny and Sal and get to what's going on. 
[02:04:30]  Denny and Sal.  Who else?  Manny.  Yes.  Manny.  Denny.  And Sal.  I don't know.  Fucking, you know.  Denny's implying fucking enlarging cream to his head.  Sal taking tears out of his beard.  Two of them.  Just shrinking.  Yeah.  The witch doctor following him.  He really is.  Yeah.  He cut the wrong person off.  He fucking ran over a girl. 
[02:05:00]  Her fucking gypsy father.  I die with it in me mouth.  In me mouth.  You'll never see us.  Your head will get thinner.  Yeah.  Tiny head.  His fucking head just crushed by a grape.  There he goes.  Denny, you got a tiny head.  Excuse me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your head is small.  I can't do anything about that now.  No, I know.  Like you could have at any other juncture.  Exactly.  Your mom had an easy time, though, giving birth to you.  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:30]  She probably didn't even get off the phone.  Drop those.  God, this thing's dropping out of me.  Little tiny-headed thing.  She knows it's a spider at first.  Your dad was happy about that.  I know.  But he rubbed your little tiny head.  Thank God for you.  Thank you for your little head.  What's up, Sal?  Sal, what's the problem with Denny?  What mic are you on?  Seven, eight?  Seven.  Whichever mic will have them.  Get a zip by yourself, a little mic.  Is that Zippy the pinhead?  That's who it is.  I don't think there'll be any photoshops.  You don't have to worry, Denny. 
[02:06:00]  Anyway, Sal, what's up?  You and Denny, there was a big fight in the office the other day, and Sam captured the  last seven seconds.  I didn't capture it.  Somebody did.  Who captured it?  Who Kid did.  Oh, the Who Kid.  I'm getting blamed for everything.  Oh, it was on the Who Kid's Instagram.  You make an environment that breeds that kind of thing.  That breeds hate.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, I do.  A little hatred.  It's competitive around here.  In between Who Kid's moisture videos, he captured the fight.  Yes, because you know it was Who Kid because he captured all this white people fight part  one, white people fight part two. 
[02:06:30]  Do we hear the audio at least?  I don't like it.  Do you want to hear what happened?  No, not really.  You don't want the context?  No, we will eventually.  I want to see what Who Kid captured.  No, stay there.  Get the fuck out of the off.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get out of the office.  You are an old child, right?  You have no brothers and sisters.  I'm going to analyze the problem.  That's actually going to be in my body.  Diddy, can you sit here for a minute?  I enjoy it coming.  I'm going to work out.  I thought you said you weren't even in the building.  Yeah, you're right in the middle of the video.  You're in the fucking frame. 
[02:07:00]  I wasn't in the building when the fight started, I said.  Oh, but you couldn't wait to get in the middle of it.  Well, when the staff is involved in an altercation, I need to be there to witness to make sure  it doesn't get out of control.  It wasn't an altercation.  It was a verbal altercation.  It wasn't an altercation.  It was an argument.  It was a discussion.  It was a verbal fight.  What was it about?  It was a heated discussion.  Did you say that, like, other humans have tucked their pants in and pulled them up as  high and Sal said it's never happened?  I just think Sal was way out of line right there.  First of all, Sal, I don't think you have the authority to be throwing anyone out of offices. 
[02:07:30]  I don't think so.  Well, he's thinking for Denny.  Well, yeah, I like Denny.  And the guy's been in the business for many, many years, albeit the bottom rung of the business.  It must mean you've got a party coming up soon.  You don't need the hard drive of hits.  There will be a summer party happening when I first open up the pool.  I don't even know what the fight is about yet.  I don't know, but he was just telling Denny to get the fuck out of the office. 
[02:08:00]  Maybe there was a good reason.  It got very heated.  So what could Denny possibly do?  I don't know.  It's been ten minutes and I still don't know what this fight was about.  I'll tell you what happened.  I walked in the office.  There was a plate of food in front of Sal.  And I said, oh, you're going to eat that.  It was the last one.  Which is infuriating because Denny does it all day long.  I forgot.  That's right.  We've talked about it.  Why do you want other people's food?  I was going to ask if you were going to finish that.  That's all.  But why?  And what were you going to do?  I was going to eat it.  Just spitting this.  What's that?  What was it?  I think it was a crab cake.  You're eating someone else's crab cake? 
[02:08:30]  A crab cake.  I'm going to use an Italian term for a second.  Denny is what is known as a gavone.  It is a gluttonous person who just will always take and take and take and take.  Now, I'm sitting there doing my work, right?  Denny comes out of nowhere.  Are you going to eat that?  I said, Denny.  I said, you're going to eat that?  I didn't yell it.  Yes, you did.  Are you that poor that you have to eat someone else's crab cake?  Are you a cheapskate?  No.  But if it's going to go in the garbage or not, then you might as well take it.  It was half eaten.  No, it wasn't half eaten.  It was like four of them. 
[02:09:00]  That's a sin.  That's cheapskate stuff.  He ate three.  Is it cheapskate stuff?  That's cheapskate stuff.  Denny is a hawk for free shit.  He's going through our garbage half the time.  It's fucking you.  You know what I do now?  What do you mean he goes through the garbage?  Oh, yeah.  Our audio.  Denny goes through the garbage because sometimes we get a lot of nonsense in the mail.  I'll walk by.  I'll see a book sitting on top of the pail.  What are you going to throw this book out?  No, no, no.  You've dug it.  You've dug it.  No, I've dug.  You know that's not being used in that office.  A book or a CD?  These idiots just thought they were colorful paperweights. 
[02:09:30]  I'm not going through it for food.  You dug through the garbage.  No, no, you're wrong.  Are you a hoarder?  No, not really.  No, there's a good book there.  That means you are.  Not really.  Not really.  He saved all those old air checks on cassette.  Yes, he is.  Did you ever take an eclair off the top of the garbage?  No, no.  It's just on top.  Never did that.  No?  Denny, I got a gift for you.  Up his drinks in the garbage.  Digging in the garbage.  You got a book over there.  Garbage picker.  Garbage picker.  I got 100 years of crossword puzzles.  I don't do crossword puzzles. 
[02:10:00]  100 years, 100 crosswords.  You know what?  That might be good for a giveaway.  Thank you.  It's not good for a giveaway.  What are you going to give it to?  You never know.  Somebody might want something.  You don't even do giveaways.  I don't want that next thing.  Do you want my Starbucks coffee cup?  No, I'm okay.  You sure?  Yeah.  So anyway, you saw a crab cake that somebody was eating and decided to say...  No, no, no.  You had like a tray.  You know when you have a whole bunch of food on a plate?  Three individual sized crab cakes.  Are you going to finish that?  And Denny said, are you going to finish that?  I have a real problem with that. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  That's creepy that someone wants my food like that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even give it a second thought.  Not to do it, but to see somebody go, are you going to finish that?  I wouldn't even think like, oh, what's he doing?  But you would give them your crab cake?  If I wasn't eating it, I would offer it to someone if I was not having it.  And I'm with you 100% with that.  Yeah.  Denny will do this dozens of times a day, every fucking day, for the past two years.  More examples.  More examples.  If I'm eating my own breakfast that I bought with my own money, I'm about to take a bite. 
[02:11:00]  Denny goes, you're going to eat that?  You're going to eat the other half?  It's like, Denny, it's a cock.  I'm not eating it.  I'm going to service this.  Yeah.  But no, it's just, it's so fucking new.  Or like if you come into the office, like you don't even, like if you get pizza, right?  Uh-huh.  Pizza party?  No.  Oh, okay.  If you just go down and get a slice.  Uh-huh.  Wait, it's not even a whole pie?  So you don't get a pie, you just have a slice.  It's your own slice.  We say pie in the New York area, by the way.  What do they say about the places?  No, if you get a pie, I'm not going to ask you if you're eating a slice.  If you're eating a slice, Denny will come in and say, hey, you got any more of that pizza? 
[02:11:30]  Right.  You got another slice?  There's no box anywhere around.  No, fuck that shit.  I'm 100%.  Thank you.  I like Denny, but I'm 100% with Sal.  If it's a whole pie and there's some slices laying around, I get it.  Right.  But not so much crem.  Oh, no, no.  The energy.  You have a tray of them.  Like if you go to cocktail hour and you have a bunch of, you know, on a plate.  Sal's talking about a certain energy.  Like a certain energy of, hey, can I have that?  Like there's certain comedians that have been like that, like taking energy and they never  offer anything or contribute anything.  They're always asking for shit. 
[02:12:00]  There's certain comics that will call me and ask me.  And do you not notice those of you who are, I never get back to you.  Wow.  Because you're always asking for shit.  No, if I have something, I'll offer it to Sal.  I'll say, hey, I got a box of oatmeal.  You want a package of oatmeal?  You want something?  I did that sarcastically that day because you always do it to me.  I don't want anything you're going to forget.  Okay.  Whoa.  Wait, how many times has Denny offered you stuff?  Only when I've sarcastic, maybe like twice.  No, if I have something, I'll offer it. 
[02:12:30]  He literally has gone into my office and there's a book on the desk.  Hey, you going to read that or?  Like he wants me to give him the book that's on my desk.  Yeah, it's like, this is a little flies.  It's not a fucking yard sale.  What's wrong with you?  And he goes, well, it's there.  I just figured out you can't.  So it has nothing to do with the actual item or that.  It's just this need to ask person.  Hold on, hold on.  If it was a book about Soul Train.  Hold on.  I know he's not going to read it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  If he did it every once in a while, like, oh my God, that's the Tyson book that I was 
[02:13:00]  thinking about and you happen to have a copy.  Hey, are you reading that?  Because I would like to read that.  I get it.  But it seems like he does it every day with things.  That's what's creepy about this.  Correct.  Every single day.  And what I do now to just to be a complete fucking asshole to Denny is like if we throw  something out or even if it's like an empty envelope that like is like expired from the  mail, I'll dump hot sauce.  Oh, I thought you were going to say you rubbed your penis on it.  No, but I'll just completely sabotage it because we know it irritates Denny because it's like  a fucking culture to our garbage.  That's what the restaurant owners do with their food so the homeless don't go into their... 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, they take more bleach in it.  Yeah, they do.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, because they've gotten sued.  That's why, by the way.  No, it's more...  They just don't want the homeless hanging around their dumpsters is how that started.  Oh, okay.  So they throw bleach on all their food that they throw away and then the word gets out.  You can't, you know...  Well, they don't even want things like muffin stumps, you know?  You could fucking try to feed them the bottom part of the muffins.  They won't like it.  Well, what?  Nice.  You know, they want the tops of the muffin.  Top of the muffin to you! 
[02:14:00]  So you're not even scratching the surface on this bite yet.  All right, let's go.  All right, so he gives it to me.  I said, thank you very much.  I take a bite.  He goes, oh, Roland's going to be mad.  So as a joke, Sal told Denny he could have Roland's and Roland's not in the office.  Right.  So Denny's now taking a bite of Roland's...  So Denny starts freaking out.  Roland's crab cake.  Roland's crab cake.  Supposedly.  Which is on his diet, I guess?  Wow.  He was celebrating.  It was Friday.  Celebratory.  Celebratory.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forgot. 
[02:14:30]  I forgot that's factored into his diet.  So I got mad because I didn't think that was funny.  I didn't want to take something that was somebody else's.  I said, what'd you do that for?  I said, Roland's going to be mad.  Two seconds later, Roland walks in the office.  Sal goes, oh, Denny ate your crab cake.  What does Roland do?  He slaps the dish and the crab cake goes on the floor.  Oh, that's good.  Because, you know, Roland's fucking rolling.  But in the same second, in the same thing, Sal is tweeting this out.  This is... 
[02:15:00]  That's what ticked me off.  This is what Denny got upset.  Wait, you started the fight.  It wasn't a fight.  Why did it tick you off that he tweeted it?  Because it's stupid.  Who cares?  And Denny said, don't tweet this.  I said, don't tweet that.  There's nothing there.  It's stupid.  Uh-huh.  What, a crab cake on the floor?  That's a tweet.  All I said was, Denny likes to come into our office and eat our food.  That's all I said.  I actually, since then, have deleted the tweet.  Why?  Because the huge fight broke out.  Well, because the fight broke out and Denny didn't want it.  Who cares?  And I completely disagree with deleting tweets.  I really do.  But you shouldn't have done it. 
[02:15:30]  You should redo it.  You should redo it.  You should redo it today.  Denny finds out that it has indeed been tweeted.  Okay.  And he marks, and he gets, not Denny mad, but actual mad.  Oh, wow.  Like, he actually got him out of kayfabe.  He was breaking character.  Uh-huh.  And he was actually a human being for it.  I don't like saying, he's not a character.  This is Denny.  But he lives in a character.  No, he lives in a character.  I think, no, I don't think so.  He does.  He lives in this weird...  Do you live in a character world?  Part of it.  Part of it.  See, it's a good escape. 
[02:16:00]  It's a good escape.  It's a good escape.  But it's not like a character.  It's not like a character that radio shows do.  It's like, he's off the air.  He's still in character.  He goes home.  He's in character.  Taking a piss.  He's in character.  So that's not...  But then when you step over and get mad.  But he's actively doing it.  Like, what is his character?  Explain your character, Denny.  Well, I mean, I'm just happy-go-lucky, Denny.  I mean, that's all right.  But he's not really that happy-go-lucky.  So then when he gets angry, for real, it seems like a departure from his character.  His idea of a really fun Saturday is going to a nursery and biting babies' fingers and 
[02:16:30]  toes until they scream.  You know who does characters?  Mr. Amis.  That's right.  I do.  Mr. Amis.  We'll go down and talk to Mr. Amis.  And so, Denny goes back into the office.  And he goes, Sal, I told you not to tweet that.  You know what?  You're a goddamn punk.  You're a punk baby.  Wow.  Wow, Denny.  And he was almost like Crispin Glover in Back to the Future going, you get your damn hands 
[02:17:00]  off of her.  Right.  And so then Sal...  No, Biff.  Sal took umbrage with the fact that Denny had called him a goddamn punk baby.  And then they got into just this huge fight.  Well, did Denny ask for some of the umbrage when Sal took it?  I just was upset.  You don't have to tweet.  You don't have to tweet every little thing.  But so what if he does?  It's always stupid.  Because there's nothing there.  And then he definitely started...  But it involved me.  Well, you chose to go to that office. 
[02:17:30]  You have a Twitter account.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  A hundred percent.  Oh, no.  Yep.  Denny, the room has turned on you.  No, I agree with Sal on this one.  We're having a heated discussion here, that's all.  I'm...  Yeah, he did.  You're a public guy.  You're not a private citizen.  You're a public figure, you know, on this radio show.  And something happened, Sal's got the right to tweet it.  But that's when Sal started saying, get the fuck out of my office.  You're an old fucking man.  That was crazy.  Go to human resources with that.  Oh, man.  Well, Denny did bring that up.  Denny goes, what if I go to human resources?  Denny.  Fucking go to human resources. 
[02:18:00]  I wouldn't.  But that's the point.  Why would you bring that up?  Well, that's bitch shit.  He just brought it up.  He's a joke.  Not in a heat.  He's a radio.  Holy fuck, it's a joke.  Oh, boy.  But you brought it up.  You're backing him into a corner.  Our show doesn't go to human resources.  He's backing a jackal into a corner.  I know, but in the same breath, I said, I wouldn't do that.  Then why mention it?  Because it was there.  Because he's calling me an old man.  Wait, did...  Sal, you called him a young punk.  Did you say it as a joke?  So you can insult him, but he can't insult you back?  I wouldn't.  Was that a threat?  No, it was a threat.  Of course it was a threat.  I just threw it out there.  Nah, bullshit. 
[02:18:30]  It was a threat.  You called him a punk.  Right.  Okay, so you can insult Sal, but he can't insult you and call you an old man.  Punk is not a problem.  You said it.  It's a problem to the punk.  You have no ability.  This is like sociopathic shit.  No ability, the arrogance, to have no ability to see that you contributed equally to that.  It was half your fault.  Are you on the spectrum?  No.  He's 100%.  A little bit, right?  A little bit.  Didn't you want a certain female that works here to get up on a copy machine and copy  that ass?  No, that was a joke.  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  That was a joke.  And then when Nicole announced her pregnancy, you told her that maybe, maybe still born.  Like, we wouldn't even say that.  We've done horrific things with our careers, and we would never say that.  We did it probably.  I just would never say that.  I know how sensitive women are when they're pregnant.  But I was just relaying the story.  That's that spectrum shit.  What a horrible story to relay.  You're so on the spectrum.  Way deep.  But you know what?  I don't think it's deep, though.  I don't know.  He threatens out of human resources in an argument.  You want to hear another clip from Who Kids White Fight? 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  Is this on World Star Hip Hop yet?  A fight.  A white and a white.  You're right.  Can I talk to my boss?  Go ahead.  But you get the fuck out of the office.  This is the opium.  I know you can see.  You talk like gentlemen.  You talk like gentlemen.  Fuck, I don't know.  Just be a gentleman.  What the fuck?  I respect you.  Are you okay?  Wow.  You called him a punk.  How is that being respectful?  Where's Iraq? 
[02:20:00]  I saw he was in the office, too.  I still think Sal's way out of line here.  I think Sal's way out of line.  I will admit Denny was able to break me.  He was able to get a rise out of me.  You should have kept it professional.  You're right.  That wasn't a professional way to represent the Opie and Anthony show in, as you pointed  out, the office of the Opie and Anthony show.  But Sal was.  But he wasn't respectful to Sal.  We didn't see the opening to that.  But it's almost like if you come in halfway on an argument and you see one guy shoves  another guy, and the only thing captured on video is the other guy shoving him back.  Oh, boy.  You know, he came in and he didn't just say to say, hey, buddy, could you not tweet that? 
[02:20:30]  And then go, I really asked you not to.  That's not cool.  He came in aggressively.  And like they said, man.  So what does that sound like?  I'm very confused.  Who cares if he tweeted it?  I totally agree.  That's not who gives a crap tweet, really.  I didn't tweet any photos or anything.  It literally just said, Denny, I put at Dennis Falcone, likes to come into our office and eat  our food.  Why did that bother you so much?  And that's a fucking fact, too.  Okay, but I didn't think there was a reason for it.  So what?  You don't need to think there's a reason for it.  Sal did.  Okay.  So you know what?  I'm going to admit, I was wrong.  Wow.  Okay.  I was wrong. 
[02:21:00]  And you know what?  I went over and I said, let's shake hands and let's...  Well, you know, we do it differently on this show.  It's an open mouth kiss.  You know that, right?  That's right.  You and Sal.  I'm a dick.  You and Sal now need to.  And you know what?  This guy helps me all the time.  If ever I need something for computers or audio, he always does.  If your balls are heavy, you need to be drained.  It was just one of those things.  You know, we're basically...  We might go to human resources.  No, I know.  Just one of those things.  Are we okay?  Yeah, we're a happy family here.  Not going to march down where... 
[02:21:30]  I don't even know where that office is.  I have no idea where it is either.  I wouldn't do that.  Thank God I don't know those people.  I would never do that.  I wouldn't know them if I bumped into them.  Why would you say that to them?  I don't know, Jim.  It was just in the heat of the moment.  Whoa.  Asia.  Heat of the moment.  Great song.  Now he's trying to suck up.  You know, that's the first super group.  I do.  I like them.  Trying to suck up by using Asia right there.  Exactly.  It worked, though.  It worked.  It was the heat.  No, Jimmy's right.  I was wrong.  No, but when you're arguing two guys, it's not like he just came up.  You'd say, I'm going to go tell the boss.  Well, no, because he was saying something in front of other people, and they might say, you know, 
[02:22:00]  Sal called him an old man.  You're transformed into where I work, saying, you're a punk baby in front of my peers.  That's what I'm saying.  I would never be crazy enough to insult somebody verbally like that, and then get mad when  they insult.  If I walked in here and said to Sam, like, you little piece of shit, and he went, fuck  you, if I said, hey, man, don't curse at me.  Right.  Like, what?  Yeah.  I'm more creeped out about the crab cake.  How much money did you save by not having to buy lunch?  No, I don't know.  Somebody just made them in the office.  Swapped them out of his hand.  He still had to buy lunch.  What do you mean they made them in the office?  Sure.  What was the last thing?  You guys are making food in the office now? 
[02:22:30]  What the fuck is this?  The lovely Heather B.  Goddamn home-ec.  Heather B.  Heather B.  Heather B.  He brought them for me.  Homemade crab cakes.  Yeah, she was making them in the morning.  Lobster mac and cheese.  They were fantastic.  Wow.  Lobster mac and cheese.  She brought it for me, Roland, and Eroch.  Why doesn't Heather B. think of the fucking on-air crew?  Is she out there right now?  You were long home by then.  What was it?  10-10?  Just see if she's right there.  So she's starting trouble with the staff.  It should have been 10-40.  Dividing the staff.  No, she's not around.  So what was the last thing that you can remember that Denny asked for, that asked to have? 
[02:23:00]  Crab cake.  Well, that was Friday.  Give us a list of some of the things he's asked for recently.  He was gone.  Where's Eric?  Monday.  Where is Eroch?  Roland bought donuts yesterday.  He's always part of these.  He brought in donuts.  Roland brought donuts.  Did he eat donuts?  I don't know.  You want another quick clip of Denny in the office?  I love it.  It still goes.  There's four clips.  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah, let's hear clip three.  But you're a punk for putting this stuff on Twitter. 
[02:23:30]  What is the reason?  They don't put it on Twitter.  You're a punk for coming in here every two minutes of every fucking day.  Yeah, every fucking day.  Asking for free shit.  When you point at your finger and go, you're nothing but a goddamn punk.  A goddamn punk.  A goddamn punk.  A goddamn punk.  There you go.  So you called out a punk twice.  You called out a punk twice.  I walked back up to the office, and Who Kid is just sitting there yelling and screaming like,  Oh, they're using a P word in there.  You can't use the P word.  I'm a fool, kid.  Ah, shit.  Here comes Eric and Roland. 
[02:24:00]  Don't answer this.  Great.  Oh, my goodness.  I hope not too close together.  The fucking wrong thing.  Yeah, exactly.  But you guys don't remember some of the things Denny has asked for in recent memory.  I don't like the answer to anything.  That doesn't help me.  It's books, CDs.  If we get like swag, like t-shirts, anything.  You guys have anything to add to this, Eric?  I saw you were in the middle of the fight there.  Roger, don't take Denny's.  No, no.  I love Denny.  Don't they ask me if Taco Bell could deliver free breakfast menu food to taste? 
[02:24:30]  You asked for free Taco Bell?  No, no.  Here's how I brought it to him.  I said, hey, by the way, Taco Bell is, no.  Denny's a mooch.  Taco Bell.  Hey, Taco Bell is a mooch.  And you know how when a restaurant or something new like that comes out, they want to promote it.  So maybe they'll be sending us something.  Hey, Taco Bell calls you to sell them.  Why don't you just go buy it?  Denny's a cheapskate.  Big time.  Denny's a chiseler.  No, not really.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  You know how Howard has a free cupcake?  I wouldn't know.  He'll go in the back and get a whole plate.  He goes, this is for tomorrow, boys. 
[02:25:00]  So you'd stash a little salad or cupcake?  Yeah, bring them out to the staff.  Usually I give one to...  Iraq, anything to add to this?  Iraq, your observations.  I think you said you were asking for the last thing he did.  What did you say with Miracle-Gro?  Iraq has the greatest 5 o'clock shot.  That is great.  It's very old Fred Flintstone.  It's an 840 shadow.  Big, giant, prickly hairs. 
[02:25:30]  It's like you have my head on your chin.  That's very impressive.  Thank you.  We're not slamming you.  It's impressive.  Yeah.  You're a man.  I'd like to shave it with a bat.  Go ahead, Iraq.  The last thing Denny had asked for was when Chelsea Handler was here.  And Roland had the stack of books that he gave everybody when she came in and everything.  And Denny was really desperate to get a book. 
[02:26:00]  For what?  He said there's some young lady that he reconnected with and he wanted to get the book for her.  Yeah, she said, oh, gee, I understand that Chelsea Handler's been in the show.  Well, is there some broad you're trying to get in the sack?  I said, see if I get you a book.  You're trying to dip it in, huh?  Go through the garbage trail.  And I went, no, no.  You're trying to get your cussuck.  You're the greatest piece of ass I ever had.  And I got books for girls all over the world.  Now you'll get the hell out of here.  And I went to Spencer, who works the talent.  I hope you're enjoying a crab cake, Tom. 
[02:26:30]  Sal is a man who demands on hearing bad news at once.  I went to Spencer.  I said, do you have a copy of the book?  A lady friend of mine would like to know.  Lady friend.  So he said, I give them to Roland.  Maybe Roland has one for you.  Roland came up to me.  I said, do you have a copy of the book?  I said, do you know Harman Askin, right?  You're a fan of Schwag.  And he said, what's the lady's name?  I'll get an autograph for you.  He has a very big heart.  Denny.  He has a very big heart.  And he said, I was.  It's called Enlarged. 
[02:27:00]  Uh-oh.  He's giving you the cat thing.  Denny, how often do you ask for things?  Like, how many times a week would you say you ask for something?  Three or four, maybe.  Maybe.  That's nice.  You've got a copy of a book.  That's roughly every day.  80% of the work days.  You guys get a lot of stuff.  Which means, and it's always higher than the number you give.  Of course.  It's pushing five days a week.  So every day he's asking.  Pretty much.  I would say every day he's getting something for free.  Actually, as we took a second there, I remembered some things that Denny has asked for. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  Oh, good.  Well, Denny one day came into the office and he was like, hey, I know the guys are getting  the Nutribullets, right?  Oh.  He's like, when can I get one of those?  Roland, did he ask that or did he not?  He asked for a full Nutribullet system.  He asked, that day, that morning, I gave Denny my old Dollar Shave Club razor blade  handle because we get a lot of the blades in the office.  Oh, oh.  You gave him the handle that you used?  Hang on.  This is where that fight got heated.  Now that I think about it, you should have brought that up earlier. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, I forgot about it.  This is why Denny got so pissed.  Sal had given him this Dollar Shave Club razor handle.  Uh-huh.  That's all it was.  And Denny said, where's the head of it?  I can't sit on it like this.  This is probably a joke.  Sorry, human resources.  Here we come.  We'll see you after the show.  We all know how Denny loves running up to human research.  Absolutely.  Running.  Really.  That's true.  That is true.  He's got his little plucked off daddy long legs. 
[02:28:30]  Exactly.  Like a marionette on the steps.  Old puppet.  Here comes old puppet shins.  You do walk like a spider.  Yeah.  I got hit by a car.  What am I supposed to do?  I'm lucky I can walk.  I'm lucky I can walk.  I know.  I wish I'd hit you in the bubble court.  Jenny.  Someone say lucky.  Sure.  Yeah.  What else, Sal? 
[02:29:00]  Was that it?  No, so he gives him the razor blade handle, and then Denny takes it, and then like two  minutes later calls Sal a goddamn punk baby.  Oh, that was just before goddamn punk baby?  Yes.  And then Sal gets really upset.  For some reason, goddamn punk baby is the one thing.  Like Marty McFly has chicken, and Sal has goddamn punk baby.  Oh, man.  I don't think anyone will tweet that today.  So you'll be safe, Sal.  There'll be no photoshopped.  You'll be all right.  Stay with you.  Is there another clip of the fight? 
[02:29:30]  Well, so I was going to say, so then Sal goes over to Denny's desk and starts going  through Denny's shit and demanding that he returns the razor blade handle.  I said, oh, how petty.  And then he finally gets it.  He finally gets it from him, and he breaks it in half and throws it in the garbage.  He said, give it back to me.  I'm going to make your life hell.  Right.  I'm going to make your life miserable.  Miserable.  And then that.  This is the shit that goes on.  I know.  I know.  And that idiot from yesterday wants us to stick around for this.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  For this.  For this.  And that's what got Denny so upset.  Was that he broke his free gift.  He had a free razor blade handle.  Yes.  Yes.  Something free was then taken away.  It was childish.  It was childish.  Childish.  I have another thing that Denny has requested in the past.  And I think we should tell this story in its entirety.  Oh, really?  Yes.  We should, huh?  Just add Sal's name to the wall, everyone.  Let's not discourage Sal.  Let's encourage him.  Let's encourage the young buck.  Denny, do you remember when you asked for the Beats by Dre? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, the headphones.  And I think we should, Sam, do you want to take the lead on telling that story?  Because you'll probably have it better than I.  Is that when he opened the box?  Yes.  Because you guys tricked me.  You guys said, open the box, it was E-Rock's box.  That was not nice.  That was not nice.  Sal tricked him again.  So E-Rock wasn't in.  It was not me.  It was Roland.  It was Roland.  Why do you easily trick?  He's so easily tricking.  And it's always the same trick.  He said, here, open this box.  It's okay.  If you were a bear, you'd have three legs. 
[02:31:00]  You must love Halloween.  Roland goes, because Roland wanted to open E-Rock's mail, but E-Rock was like, of course you  can't, I'm not there, and so then Roland goes, hey, Denny, your beats are here, they're right  in that box, just open them, and Denny goes, oh, all right, I'll just open them up.  Opened up.  And he rips open the box that's addressed to E-Rock, and I don't know, there's just some  bullshit.  He put them on his little head and then bent forward and couldn't stand up.  He was a baseball little guy.  That wasn't funny, because that was E-Rock's hilarious.  That was fucking hysterical. 
[02:31:30]  They used your greed against you.  There were no headphones in that box.  No.  No.  I didn't want E-Rock thinking I'm opening up his stuff.  You were.  You know what it is with Denny?  Hold on, but beats aren't going to fit on that tiny head of yours.  No, no.  Exactly.  They cave it in.  They were just made of metal.  Right.  Yeah.  You know what it is with Denny, though?  And this is all part of the old school radio thing.  You know this.  So when you were in radio in the earlier days, it was all about free shit.  You didn't make money.  Right.  You didn't make any money in the business.  So you felt good about getting tickets to shows, and t-shirts, and hats, and food, and 
[02:32:00]  you know, it's part of the whole upbringing of somebody on the radio.  Well, here's Heather B.  Heather B.  Hi, Heather.  Who made the crab cakes that started a war in our office.  Oh, my God.  Seriously?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone loves them.  I heard they were great.  White people fight.  I only had a bite.  He said, what happened?  Who kid Instagrammed white people fight?  They were fighting over your crab cakes.  It was all because of the crab cakes.  But you guys are always really nice to me.  Ever since you offered me donuts and tequila, it's been hard to walk away, and I bring you 
[02:32:30]  something, so when I have gifts, I have vodka today, but when I have gifts, you are always  more than welcome.  Why do you have vodka today?  I have vodka every day.  I just made it sound like today was special, but I have vodka today.  Is there vodka in that coffee cup?  This is water.  I don't blame you.  I love it.  But thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  We usually cook.  We have a party every Friday on Swain and Morning.  It's amazing what's going on in there on Friday. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, well, it's Fantasy Friday, so we just keep the whole theme going with the strippers.  I don't partake in that, but I just...  I saw some pictures and stuff.  There was some action going on in there.  There was one of the strippers.  What's her name?  Mary Jean.  Mary Jean.  She was in there.  She's been on our show.  And another one of the girls that I see walking around here is kissing her and stuff.  Well, Tracy G, she does our Celebrity Wire and everything.  She's bisexual.  Uh-huh.  So she has a segment on Fridays called The School of Sex.  Oh.  So that's why I leave on The School of Sex. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, man.  I have nothing to do with that segment.  It was pretty good.  And that's usually when I get the ice and the cranberry juice.  Is Sway looking for a white co-host?  Come on in any time.  He always says he's going to stop by.  Has he come in yet?  No.  Nor has he ever invited us in.  We noticed that.  His curtains remain closed.  He's never invited us in.  There's a good waiver, though, when he walks by.  Oh, yeah.  Sway gives a quick wave and right in.  Yeah, keep going.  He's got a strong wave.  It's Friday.  No, we're headed to South by Southwest today.  Oh, right. 
[02:34:00]  Next Friday, there's food.  Oh, God.  I'll make sure I'll stop by here first and take care of now.  So you guys are going to South by Southwest?  Yes.  The whole show?  Well, Sway, myself, and about five of us.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  It's about 12 of us.  This is why I lose my effing mind.  They don't let us go anywhere.  There's always an issue.  Who's paying for it?  Sway.  Oh.  Does the company not pay for it?  Sway.  Sway is...  I think it says Sway.  Sway is footing the bill to send all you guys...  How much money does he make? 
[02:34:30]  They might be reimbursing him.  Pretty righteous.  I don't know.  He's doing stuff down here.  So MTV is doing stuff.  Oh, he's doing stuff.  Okay.  He's doing a lot of stuff.  Wow.  So seriously, all right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I thought it was...  He almost started another warhead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, he's doing a bunch of stuff.  Like, he's, you know, out and about.  But the Sway in the morning show will be broadcasting live Thursday and Friday.  After that, I'm off the clock.  Oh, he might have got MTV to pay for them.  Look, I can't go down there without these guys.  Yep.  Good for Sway.  I'm happy.  I'm a plus one.  Yeah, huh?  Cool.  Heather B is so nice. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, she's very lovely.  Oh, thank y'all.  Y'all got food.  Y'all love y'all.  I'm an easy girl.  Donuts and tequila.  Y'all got me forever.  So as long as I'm next door, I'll be bringing it up.  I want a crab cake.  I'd love to try one of these.  It was a lobster.  It was lobster macaroni and cheese.  And everyone said...  Jeez.  That's what I was asking.  I didn't know you guys ate shellfish.  It was weird.  I saw Roland.  Roland's my buddy.  He hooked me up with the Bloody Mary guys.  I'm all about alcohol.  I'm the easiest girl to get involved with.  We are learning something about Heather B. 
[02:35:30]  You got me.  Heather's an alcoholic.  I'm a certified mixologist.  Make me sound fancy.  I love it.  Yeah.  So that's how Roland.  I saw them and that's how it all started.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So I got y'all next Friday.  I think we're having chicken wings or buffalo wings or something.  So I got you.  Yes.  Cool.  Yeah.  Thank you, y'all.  Make some extra.  Thank you, Heather.  Thank you, Heather.  Thank you, Heather B.  Take it easy.  Wait for my invite on Sway Show, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to bring y'all vodka right now, though.  Okay.  All right.  I think Sal and I brought a nice segment to the program today.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Sal just tells them to shut up. 
[02:36:00]  Are we done with this or anyone else?  No.  Because we have a clip, right?  One more clip.  Sam has a clip.  Okay, Sam.  Sorry.  There's one more video from Hoot Kid.  Are you kidding me?  You're an intern.  You cannot film.  Hoot Kid's talent.  Don't look at that.  Whoa.  You guys have to put people down.  Why is there so much hate?  Let me finish the fucking story.  Go ahead.  You should start talking.  You just scroll right in your mouth.  Sal is a perfect example of someone that gets shit on all day. 
[02:36:30]  Shit, shit, shit.  And has to pick out some poor son of a bitch to shit on.  That was shitty.  And don't forget.  That was shitty.  I will admit that.  No, it wasn't.  It was fucking douchey.  Oh, the intern wanted to video something?  But if I was an intern, I never did shit like that.  I never.  I mean, I fuck with you.  I'm going to work.  I fuck with you.  I never like film crap.  Kenny's got something.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Sal, you might want to rethink that.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The truth.  I genuinely do not remember.  How did you get this job? 
[02:37:00]  How did you get this job?  Sucking dick.  Exactly.  I think it was that Panda production.  He got rewarded for being a rat, a cheese eater.  Oh, shit.  Oh, what?  I don't even know.  Yeah, Kenny has called me a cheese eater.  I don't remember.  Wait, what happened, Kenny?  Of course you don't remember.  You have selective memory.  Oh.  What happened, Kenny?  What happened?  Well, Sal, when he was an intern, all right, he was one of the better interns. 
[02:37:30]  And when the cream rises to the top, they're given positions of trust.  And Sal had to get the talents food every day because he was the only one that could be entrusted to get it right.  And that's an honor to get that assignment.  I'm so embarrassed.  And Sal complained that he was being overworked because other interns would sit around and do nothing. 
[02:38:00]  And Sal was being performance punished because he had to get the talents food every day.  He did complain about it.  And he complained about it.  How does that make him a cheese eater?  He ratted to the bosses.  I didn't report anything.  Can I get a turkey chili?  Of course you may.  Thank you.  I get it.  Because instead of going to Kenny and saying, hey, blah, blah, blah, Sal went to the bosses.  And then Kenny, you know, got a talking to about the way he was treating people. 
[02:38:30]  That's right.  Cheese eater.  I went to Irock at the time.  He was my boss.  Garber.  Yeah.  Well, Irock brought it up to Garber and then it became a problem.  I believe his name is Radio Wizard.  Oh, wait.  Irock went to Gary.  So it wasn't.  Whoa.  Where's our trophy?  Gary.  I remember him.  Irock, did Sal go to you and you went to Gary?  As an intern, why would I ever talk to the program director?  Program director?  He was a secretary. 
[02:39:00]  What the hell's wrong with you?  I'm trying to remember this.  It became such an issue.  Why is it an issue now?  Yeah, I know.  It became such an issue.  To me, put us in this position.  I remember Radio Wizard had told me that.  We're going to be rock.  That ain't working.  That's the way you do it.  He looks like the guy from that video now.  That's weird.  It's grown more.  You think it's grown?  Yes.  Those big boxes piled up are his dollar-shave clothes. 
[02:39:30]  His untouched dollar-shave clothes.  Pristine.  You guys don't have any extra handles, do you?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  All right, look.  I wish we could, like, I don't know, bring this whole segment together.  I know how to do it.  Kenny's got it.  Kenny?  I'll say this.  Dennis has been nothing but a gentleman towards me.  Oh.  Because you have the same head issue.  He's very courteous.  Tiny head guild.  He's very polite.  He's very gentlemanly.  He's a gracious co-worker. 
[02:40:00]  And Sal?  Not so much.  Cheese eater.  Well, I forgive and I forget.  You don't forget.  You just brought it up for the first time.  We all forgot.  Yeah, you didn't forget anything.  No, I don't forget.  We forgot until today.  But I forgave him.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  I think nothing's really been settled, but it's been aired.  No, I admitted I was wrong.  Oh, that's true.  And Sal.  He did admit he was wrong.  Do you have anything to say?  Final thoughts. 
[02:40:30]  Don't talk to me ever again, Danny.  Wow.  There you go.  Danny, final thoughts.  I'm okay with that.  Then we'll have a hug, then.  Take your shirts off and hugs.  Oh, that's how we do it on the Open Energy Show.  Come on, Danny.  Come on, let's do it.  Shirts off.  Shirts off.  I'm not taking my shirt off.  No shirt off.  Shirts off.  What are you talking about?  Take your shirts off.  What are you taking your glasses off?  All right.  That was great.  That's nice.  That's great.  Oh, jeez.  Hang on.  Let me...  I've never seen two guys shooting their pants at the same time. 
[02:41:00]  Denny, how long have you had those jeans?  It's taking his picture.  Denny has mom jeans on.  Yes, he does.  How old are you?  It's really a year old.  Got a sensible belt.  Whose garbage did you pull that out of?  No, man.  Whose garbage?  Exactly.  You wearing those pants?  You guys should...  Madeleine Albright throw out her jeans and you...  You guys should...  They're giant.  How his Florida trip was.  Why?  Why?  Exactly.  Too bad it wasn't like Rats or Rizzo.  He died on the bus. 
[02:41:30]  I know he did.  And we shot his pants.  How was the weather in Florida, Dennis?  It was beautiful.  It was 81 degrees.  Ah, it's wonderful.  Good thing it wasn't snowing.  Could you imagine shoveling snow in that heat?  I've been saying that line for 30 years.  Yeah, you posted it on Facebook.  It's not a great line.  Yeah, because it's snowing.  He loves it.  Kenny likes it.  Kenny just set up that awful line.  Yeah.  We worked pretty well together there.  Oh, God, yeah.  I don't get the line, though.  Well, because it wouldn't snow. 
[02:42:00]  It's 81 degrees.  Right.  So then what would you go into?  Well, but that's the joke of it.  Huh?  Yeah.  That's the joke of it.  That's the joke of it.  What?  All right.  I think we all should...  Get over it.  Get over it.  Yeah.  No more pitching a fit.  No more.  Yeah.  No more asking for this.  Sal was pitching a little fit.  I was.  In there.  Poor dumb intern from Jersey, right across the bridge.  Well, why don't we go to break?  Across the bridge.  We got great stuff still to do on the show. 
[02:42:30]  We got the 911 call.  Was that the one with the cat?  Oh, yeah.  It's a great one.  And then...  Bruiser Brody.  Chelsea Handler.  Yeah.  Chelsea Handler.  It's really good from Piers Morgan.  Thank you, Sam.  She fucking beat him up, right?  Yeah, good.  A little bit.  And our pal made TMZ.  Something he was trying to not talk about.  Uh-huh.  It's now everywhere.  We'll explain next day there.  Oh, yeah.  The voice of the channel.  How cool is that?  Yeah.  Let's go to TMZ.  Man, I was just hanging out with Jim Brewer Saturday night. 
[02:43:00]  The pizza guy saga started on this radio show.  Has just a good, solid story from Brewer.  He's a good storyteller.  He's got a guy that's just a pain in the ass in his town.  And it's just escalated to the point where now, you know, there's charges.  The police are involved.  There's been threats.  All sorts of crap.  It's a lot of fucking drama.  And Brewer killed it at the Paramount in Huntington over the weekend.  And backstage, we were talking about this. 
[02:43:30]  And he's like, you know, I'm really dealing with some crazy stuff with this guy.  And he wants to come on the show and talk about it.  But he realizes he probably shouldn't.  Every time he comes on, he wants to spill it.  Of course.  And he was hoping to keep this out of the press, this part of it.  Yeah.  But now it's on TMZ.  So we have to talk about it.  Everyone goes to TMZ.  My God, this isn't some tiny little blog that no one is going to read.  So what does it say there, Sam? 
[02:44:00]  It's pretty much the stuff he was telling us Saturday night, right?  Yeah.  I wondered how it got out.  Yeah, that's a little strange to me.  It said, Jim Brewer's ex-neighbor is now facing felony stalking charges.  Felony stalking charges.  Great.  He's got one of those guys, too.  Damn.  And yes, I said two.  Felony stalking.  Yep.  After allegedly mailing a box of condoms to the actor's house in a perverted joke involving Jim's underage daughters. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, boy.  Sources close to Jim tell TMZ the actor's been having problems with Giuseppe and Frida.  Oh, my God.  You never want to have to deal with a Giuseppe.  Giuseppe.  Oh, God.  Growing up on Long Island, you never wanted to deal with a Giuseppe.  Hey, Giuseppe.  Oh, man.  All right.  Go ahead.  So, TMZ was told that Giuseppe left extremely creepy comments on a YouTube video about Jim,  such as, quote, how's your three pretty daughters doing? 
[02:45:00]  Days later, Jim claims Ian Frida shipped him a box of condoms.  We're told Jim called police in early January, and Ian Frida was arrested on felony stalking charges.  We spoke to Ian Frida, who told us he denies...  Giuseppe.  Yeah, Giuseppe, who told us he denies leaving the YouTube comments about Jim and his daughters.  He did say he doesn't like his kids hanging around Jim, which is an issue since their kids are friends.  Giuseppe has a hearing Wednesday on the stalking charges and is prohibited from contacting Jim and his family as a condition of bail. 
[02:45:30]  I believe it's, uh...  He's got to deal with this shit.  I believe it's, uh, the YouTube video associated with this radio show from the appearance.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Supposedly he's all over the comments section in these pizza man videos or pizza guy, whatever it was.  Whatever it's called.  Yeah.  I thought this got taken down.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Oh.  You can never really get rid of him. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  That internet, what is it, a quarter of a century old now?  25 years?  I'm friends with, uh, Mr. Brewer, and I could, I could say this much.  He's been dealing with this guy for a really long time.  The guy will just not leave him alone.  Period.  Yeah, you gotta just kill him.  Period.  If you're Jim Brewer.  Yeah, you just gotta take him out.  What are you gonna do?  If the guy starts fucking making threats to your children, wow, that's fucked up. 
[02:46:30]  It's so odd, too, because how can anybody not like Jim?  Like, I've dealt with Jim on the road and worked with him, besides just being in here, but I mean, just being in other places together.  And he's, oh, he's been such a great guy for the 20 years I've known.  Like, I've known him for 20 years, and he's been a great guy every time I've seen Jim.  He's been a great guy.  He's an amazing guy, an amazing friend.  Yeah.  Period.  There's more of this story that, I'll just say this, Giuseppe effed up really bad.  Yeah.  And that part isn't in this TMZ story, so I'm sure it'll come out very soon. 
[02:47:00]  But wait till you hear what he did.  Wait till you hear.  And what he thought he could get away with.  Oh, you can't say anything.  No, I better not.  Can you write it down?  Um, yeah.  Well, we have any on hold music or anything?  I could do it that way.  Put him on hold music.  How about you don't ask, hey, the boss wants him on hold music.  Well, can we put the boss on hold?  No.  What happened to our old boss?  The boss.  Not can we.  The boss wants hold music.  Let's put the boss on hold. 
[02:47:30]  No.  Whenever you get a chance.  It's quick like that.  Yeah, we'll be fine.  Jesus.  We understand.  What are you working with?  Fucking, fucking, the guy in South Africa is fast.  With his stumps on the button.  Couldn't think of his name.  Yeah.  Spatula guy.  Blade runner.  Didn't we have it on our machines for a while?  We did, but God only knows.  We used to go on hold a lot more than we do these days, so.  I'm ready now, guys.  Let's put the boss. 
[02:48:00]  That's hilarious.  And that will come out.  That will come out.  Is that unbelievable?  Yeah.  And was there an arrest for that?  I don't know.  I don't know that much.  Should have been.  I don't know that part of it, but that sounds like a crime.  We're talking about interracial dating.  Right, right.  Stalkers are fun, aren't they, guys?  I've had one.  We all had or have.  I never had one, a physical one.  I never felt physically threatened, necessarily. 
[02:48:30]  And when women do it, it's less.  Thank you, buddy.  The internet just grabbed my penis.  When you have a female stalker, they're less dangerous because they don't.  They're less likely to be physically a problem.  That's true.  They're annoying.  Occasionally, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm saying, in general, they're on the phone.  Are they?  Babble.  Yeah.  That was great.  I'm sure more will come out as far as Pete's Man and Jim Brewer goes, now that it made TMZ. 
[02:49:00]  You know what he really ought to get, and this is true, is there a way to diffuse this  where everybody can just walk away?  And you need a guy like a Gavin DeBecker who does understand all of this stuff and what  happens in situations like this between two people and it escalates and it escalates.  And there always is a way to just walk away from it.  But what does it take so both people can go, all right, let's just walk away?  Crazy people.  Aha, you just got to get over it.  Yeah, it's funny.  Yeah.  But what would a guy like Gavin DeBecker say? 
[02:49:30]  Crazy people don't understand the concept.  They don't understand that they should just walk away.  No, no, no.  That's the problem.  But everybody in the situation, unless they're totally out of it, which I don't think anybody  here is totally, you want something.  What is it you want?  Is it a vindication or what is it that everybody wants?  I just don't know.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Oh, Jim also wanted to tell you, Ant.  Yeah.  He purchased. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, what a guy.  Good for him.  Smart.  A cock ring is such an odd thing to buy.  Yeah, a cock ring.  He's very happy with his purchase.  Oh, that's good.  He wanted me to relay that to you.  We ought to hang.  The neck.  Let's move on to Chelsea Handler, giving Piers Morgan the business.  Good for her.  Yeah, what did she do?  It's easy to say, you know, that you hate Piers Morgan.  I actually liked watching him on CNN.  I didn't.  I know. 
[02:50:30]  I know you didn't.  Not even because of his political views and stuff like that.  He just, to me, I'm sorry, he wasn't interesting.  Yeah.  He's not an interesting guy.  He had some balls.  More than most of these guys, I thought.  More than most, even?  I thought.  Yeah?  He had some tough questions and things like that.  And he didn't go for the popular thing.  No?  No.  Apparently not.  Oh, have a cracker, Jimmy.  Thank you.  But, with that said, he got his ass handed to him by Chelsea Handler.  Ooh. 
[02:51:00]  And this clip is going everywhere today.  You want to just play it?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  Chelsea Handler, Piers Morgan.  Life when you're not working.  What will your life here be this week?  What will you do?  Well, I am working this week.  After the show, where do you go?  What do you do?  Well, I have to come here and tolerate this nonsense.  And then I have to do...  This is nonsense.  It's designed to flog your talkery book.  I know.  I'm going to go do a book signing at Target in Westwood.  Yeah.  And then I go on the road every weekend and perform live stand-up comedy.  And do book signings.  And, uh, you know, that's it.  I'm just... 
[02:51:30]  I'm a workhorse.  I'm a workaholic.  You tweet very amusingly.  I wish you did.  Oh, that's good.  I mean, in the middle of the commercial break, I want your viewers to know you...  I mean, they must know, because they're probably following you on Twitter.  I mean, you can't even pay attention for 60 seconds.  You're a terrible interviewer.  Oh, well, keeping my attention.  That's more an issue for you than me.  Well, but that's not my problem.  It is your problem.  This is your show.  You have to pay attention to the guests that you invited on your show.  You say they're interesting enough.  Yeah, they...  Listen, it doesn't matter how interesting I am.  You signed up for this job.  Of course it does. 
[02:52:00]  Well, maybe that's why your job is coming to an end.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Bravo.  Wow.  Bravo.  I guess during the commercial break, he's tweeting.  Right.  He's tweeting, so...  And you can't just turn around and say, well, you're not interesting.  That's what he tried to pull on her, but...  Because, you know, she got the best of him.  Oh, man.  That takes balls.  Good for Chelsea Handler.  I wonder what that's all about.  Like, she...  He must have just annoyed her. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because she...  She would have just given him the benefit of the doubt.  Or she would have...  If she truly didn't like him going into the thing, she probably would have said no to the interview, no?  There's plenty of other hosts on CNN she could have went on.  Yeah.  So it must have been something that was going on during the break where she was like, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know.  She's more popular than he is.  That could come off as bossy.  Whoa.  No.  I think Chelsea Handler was being bossy.  Whoa.  Watch out.  I know.  I'm fully backing.  I'm fully backing the ban bossy hashtag, but in that case, that was bossy. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  How's that bossy thing working out for everybody?  I think everyone forgot it with Coney.  It's already gone.  Got to ban bossy.  Everybody got all worked up about Obama in between two ferns.  That's true.  So bossy went out the fucking window.  Is that what happened?  People thought it was bussy, so they were all taking the train.  No.  It's just...  Is that a good one?  No.  It's not even close to good. 
[02:53:30]  It's so far from good.  Neither am I.  You send your boy a birthday gift or what?  I'm trying to think of what boy.  Mitt Romney.  He's 67 today.  Hey, my boy Mitt Romney.  You sent him something?  A little something-something for his birthday?  No, he's got plenty of cake himself.  He doesn't need me.  People are saying that documentary's great.  I gotta watch it.  Yeah?  You saw it?  Yeah.  Yeah, they follow him.  Supposedly he's not such a stiff.  No, he actually comes across like a real human being.  Yeah.  God, what happens to these guys? 
[02:54:00]  They followed him on the first campaign trail and then the second one.  I saw him...  I guess it was Perry, right?  It was the Texas guy?  Yeah.  Rick Perry?  Rick Perry.  He was on recently on one of these news programs, and he was like, so different.  What happens when you're going for the presidency?  I guess you're so fucking tiptoeing and worried about what you're saying that you can't be  yourself and it comes across like you're a robot or you come across like you're uninformed  about things, but he was very articulate and, you know, and having just a good time 
[02:54:30]  on the news the other day.  Yeah.  Because everything you get caught with now, like, look what he said.  Remember he said that thing about the, in that discussion he was having and somebody  videotaped him and it wasn't interpreted...  Romney or what Rick Perry were talking about?  Romney.  Romney.  He was talking about something, whatever it was he said.  He said the 47% that won't vote for him.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Like, they have to be on guard.  Whereas all those years ago, everybody wasn't such a rat and you didn't get videotaped like  that.  And the press, they've been despicable for many years, but there was a time where they didn't 
[02:55:00]  take every single little thing you said and try to make it work against you.  Yeah.  They understood context.  Right, context.  Yeah.  I think the public is starting to get sick of all that anyway, finally.  I don't know.  We're going to get there.  I don't know.  Maybe.  We're going to be like enough already.  Stop picking apart every single word that this person is saying.  Are you saying the pendulum might swing back the other way?  I do believe that could be a possibility.  What a song about that.  Yes.  It's interesting seeing him go through the debate process.  Yeah.  Because remember, he killed Obama on the first debate. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  And even after that, like, everybody's around him going like, oh, great job.  You did it.  You did it.  And he's like, well, you know, it's very traditional.  Usually the new guy wins the first debate.  He's going to come back strong for the second.  So he knew, yeah.  Like, he wasn't gloating.  He wasn't clueless.  I honestly, I think Mitt Romney would have made a good president.  I think he would have.  Oh, the best president ever?  No.  No, I know.  I know.  Who knows?  I think he would have made a good president.  Who knows?  I don't think he would have been a disaster like we have now. 
[02:56:00]  Are you not happy with Obama's job he's done?  Not really.  Oh.  I was watching that House of Cards.  I was trying to do it.  Oh, were you?  That's right.  That's okay.  We were doing a bit.  Oh, shit.  I thought you were just getting food.  I wasn't trying.  I was trying to not let it distract me.  Yeah.  Then I didn't realize it was a bit.  Jimmy Gess keeps offering his rap.  Oh, yeah.  I might have tried a Denny line, like, are you going to eat that or something?  Oh, are you going to eat that?  Trust me.  It wasn't going to be a brilliant bit.  No.  I'm sorry.  I was watching, when I was watching House of Cards. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  I was looking, just going, oh, look, it's a gray-haired, white president.  Look at that.  It was like the old days.  I was waxing fantastic about it.  Just leaning back on, ah, remember that?  What that looked like?  Yeah.  I like having a black president.  No, you don't.  I really do.  No, you don't.  Explosion and building.  I don't think about it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Explosion and building collapse right here in New York.  New York City, 116th and Park.  Oh, no.  No, it's probably one of those under-construction things, huh? 
[02:57:00]  No, no, no.  Breaking news.  Is how many people might have been in that building.  We don't know.  I can't tell, certainly, from looking at it, if there might be offices.  Often in these buildings that look residential like this, you also have businesses that are  on the ground floor.  There wasn't any Malaysian airliner's seen.  There might have been in that building.  They hope it's a lot, though.  It may bode well.  The news hopes it's a lot.  Of course.  That more people would have been out of the building.  Please have a building full of dead people. 
[02:57:30]  The news loves that.  Oh, and...  Very closely.  But, again, for you who might just be joining us, let's update you on the pictures that  you're seeing on the 116th and Park Avenue.  This is Harlem in New York City.  What appears to be an explosion and a partial collapse of a building and huge assets from  the fire department on the scene right now.  We know that there are a few injuries, some people, perhaps four people, taken to local  hospitals.  Train evacuations continue to be underway, and Grand Central Station, Metro North trains  going north, have been suspended. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, boy.  We're going to take a quick break.  Be back with more on MSNBC.  That'll make a mess.  Hmm.  I think they should...  Yeah, get home.  Wow.  So, like, the building collapsed?  Yeah.  And people are not going to be able to get home?  Apparently.  Well, I know what they better do.  Get over it.  Ah, shit.  Get over it.  Man, where is that?  Harlem?  Yeah.  Crime.  Get you to think.  Get over it.  Get over it.  That would be on the east side. 
[02:58:30]  I'm allowed to say I'm not happy with having a black president in office, just as people  were saying constantly, oh, what do we want, another old white guy in office?  It's the same exact fucking thing.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying you can't say it.  I actually just like kind of having one.  I don't know.  I mean, now I don't think about it.  I like the idea of it when it first happened.  I don't even think about it anymore, to be honest.  I just look at it and I'm like, ugh, it's the asshole trying to raise my taxes.  That's literally all I think of.  Yeah.  Because my taxes are going up. 
[02:59:00]  I don't care about anything else but that.  Constantly going up.  Do your fair share.  Just asking for a little more from the wealthy, from the people that could afford it, a little  more.  And they keep grabbing a little, little, little from so many different places.  Don't they know that we fucking know it adds up to a lot more?  Do you see now what they want to do in New York City schools?  They want to give every kid the free lunch because it would take the stigma off the kids that  do have the free lunch because they can't, you know. 
[02:59:30]  They, they, they're standing in the, the free lunch line and they get the kids that can  pay for lunch or paying for it.  And then the kids to look like they're utter nonsense.  How about everybody has to wear the same clothes because then the rich kids clothes are going  to look nice.  They do that in Catholic schools.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  But I mean, that's uniformers.  I mean, I'm, I'm saying for, for level of reasons of poverty and well.  Captain Hook fish and chips.  They make you wear the uniform when you're taking those catch of the day boxes out to the  boys at IBM.  Have some pride. 
[03:00:00]  Have some pride.  I love that guy.  Have some pride.  Like that's pride.  Dressing up in that fucking thing.  Did you get to buy lunch at school?  I was a buy lunch kid and then I turned into a free lunch kid.  Nice.  You were a free lunch kid?  Yeah.  I had to get the free lunch.  I was on the way.  No, I was on the free lunch.  Nice.  Because we qualified, you know, mom was working her ass off. 
[03:00:30]  Three kids.  How'd you pay?  Pops was like.  You were just, your name was on the list?  Yeah, name on the list.  Did they at least make believe you were paying or did everyone know?  No, everyone pretty much knows.  Oh, man.  But it didn't matter.  There was all the degenerate kids I hung out with.  They wanted the free lunch and they were all, you know, if there was somebody making fun  of me because they paid and I didn't, I probably wasn't hanging out with them anyway.  In our school, there were so many kids on free lunch that they didn't even try to hide  it.  They were just like, if you, at the beginning of the school year in the classroom, whoever 
[03:01:00]  has their free lunch forms, bring them to the front.  Yeah.  And like three quarters of the class would bring up their forms.  Come up and, yeah.  Yep.  And there you are with your little bag with love inside, filled with love and a treat  and a cookie.  Mommy's lunches.  Did it in all paper bags.  Of course you did.  How many black kids stepped on your paper bag lunch?  Nobody.  Oh, man.  They should have.  They should have punted it into your face.  They really should have.  What did mommy make for you for the school lunch?  You know what she would do?  She would open it and just drop a deuce into it.  And she'd piss into a thermos. 
[03:01:30]  Just to set this up.  Big nasty shit with the crust off.  Yeah.  Big long shit that would poke out of the top of the bag like a fucking snake charmer.  I bet you went to school with Tupperware.  You were one of those kids.  No, never Tupperware.  Everything was a nice Tupperware.  Tupperware.  Let me explain my lunch and most of the long time listeners know.  The go-to lunch for me and my brothers and sisters was one bruised apple because bruised  apples were a lot cheaper than apples without bruises. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, God.  So every apple we ate had one of those bruises in it.  So she'd buy like a pound of bruised apples.  Usually Macintosh apples.  Ah, mealy fucking Macintosh.  And then mealy shitty sock apples.  Terrible.  It's like a sock with apple flavoring on it.  And then she would get the Pepperidge Farm bread because that was cheaper for whatever  reason back then especially.  The second you buy it, it seems stale.  I think it was like day-old bread or whatever they called it so it was a little cheaper.  And then it would be peanut butter and jelly with the jelly completely soaking through the 
[03:02:30]  Pepperidge Farm thin bread.  And then it was put in and people to this day don't believe it.  I don't care.  But there were times we went to school with cement bags.  Oh, the cement bag.  Because my dad loved cementing around our house.  There was, the concrete came in the bag and once he dumped it out and mixed it and made  some.  My mom saved every bag.  Saved the bag and gave it as a lunch bag.  Of course not.  It wasn't every day.  That was a rarity. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  But a lot of days it was certainly one of those giant Wahlbaums bags.  Yeah.  She didn't buy the tiny little sandwich bags.  Yeah.  So then we'd have to fold it and make it look like it's almost like a normal lunch bag.  That was my lunch.  Now, what about you, Sam?  Well, we always...  You privileged fuck.  Oh, Sam.  Get hot.  Can't help.  Look at him.  He has been working on it.  Let me give you a little perspective.  I'll give you a little perspective.  Are you going to add to this?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  When I did bring lunch in, in elementary school...  You drank it?  I drank it.  I drank it.  Elementary school, making a little martini.  A little bottle of lunch.  A liquid lunch.  I would have in my Lost in Space lunchbox...  Ew.  What a douche.  No, it was very cool.  I had a picture of the robot, Will Robinson on the outside.  Oh, no.  And had the little thermos inside.  Which was the Dr. Smith and he fucking held the top of shit like a cock.  He'd sit on it.  He'd sit on the thermos. 
[03:04:00]  It was ham and Swiss on Wonder Bread, white bread.  Hey.  Ham sliced in, please, Mommy.  Thank you.  We knew it was white bread.  If she gave you a pumpernickle, you'd probably booed and threw it out.  And in the thermos, chicken noodle soup.  Campbell's chicken noodle soup.  Soup and a sandwich?  Soup and a Sammy.  There's some love right there.  Oh, it was great.  And then the little thing of milk, but with a little plastic baggie of chocolate, so you 
[03:04:30]  could put it in there.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  You could make your own chocolate?  How did you go from that to free lunch?  Well, free lunch was after we got a little older.  Mommy stopped making our lunch.  Dad was gone.  Things happened.  You know, shit happened.  Mom said, fuck this.  Things really did take a change for you, huh?  They kind of deteriorated rapidly after the divorce.  Huh.  I thought of you in Ontario last week, because I was about an hour from the San Juan Capistrano. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, right.  And I thought of Anthony's old home.  You should have taken a drive through there.  Oh, boy.  I thought of that for about ten seconds.  Exactly.  And I went, no, why would I?  It would be like all mini malls.  On the Ortega Highway.  Oh.  We should go to Anthony's West Coast home.  We should go where the tree fort was.  We should broadcast from your West Coast home.  Yeah.  Let me, before we ask Sam what he got for lunch, we got a phone call from, who's this?  Oh.  It's the lady trucker.  Oh, hi, lady trucker.  Okay.  Say, uh, Opie, did you ever have a hot school lunch? 
[03:05:30]  Aw.  Go away, you slob.  Oh, man.  It's a fair question.  Terrible.  Opie hates lady trucker.  I don't hate her.  She wasn't going to ask you to have a hot school lunch.  You're meaner to her than any other caller.  What are you talking about?  Hey, hey, it's lady trucker.  Hey.  Oh, my God, it's lady trucker.  You sure didn't skip a meal ever.  Yeah.  I did get hot lunches because I was, I hated the lunch that my mom gave us.  Sounds delicious. 
[03:06:00]  I don't know how you could hate it.  I would dig up change.  I would take change from various cookie jars and such.  Yeah.  And I, uh, I would throw the old lunch-a-roo in the garbage.  Oh.  And then I would get some nice, uh, yeah, I started getting hot lunches at school.  But I don't remember.  Pizza?  I don't remember it being free hot lunch in my, in my school district.  I just don't remember.  Harborfield's right.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I don't think our district offered that.  Centerport.  Ooh.  I used to do a marvelous impression of the Pepperidge Farm, man. 
[03:06:30]  Did you?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  I was a kid, though.  All right.  Let me hear.  Pepperidge Farm, remember?  Is that good?  Uncanny.  That's what I think of when I think of Pepperidge Farm is the fucking shitty dry bread.  It's terrible.  That's awful.  It's like you bought it stale.  The freshest package of that bread would seem stale.  Cracks like a fossil.  Yeah, you can't bend, you know, you can't fold. 
[03:07:00]  Look, I'm trying to fold it.  Yeah.  And I just...  It's good if you're eating a sandwich, like if you're eating two pieces of bread and a piece of slate in between them.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the type of dryness you need.  It's horrible.  Nothing was better than fresh Wonder Bread.  Oh, was that good.  I like Wonder Bread.  Open it up.  Peel the crust off.  I like a good crust.  Fuck that.  You had your crust cut off your sandwiches?  No, no.  I like a good Wonder Bread crust. 
[03:07:30]  It's good stuff.  And then I got a little older.  I matured.  I went to Rolls and Heroes.  That's right, because you could fuck them.  That's right.  You could fuck a good roll.  I like to hollow out a good roll and give it a rogering.  Fair rogering.  So, Sam, what was your lunch for Mommy?  Oh, from the time I was young until I was a senior in high school.  Oh, no.  It was the same lunch that Precious had from her mother.  I ate a pussy.  Yes.  Sorry.  It wasn't that.  Store-bought paper bags. 
[03:08:00]  Always.  Just for lunch.  Always plenty.  Yeah.  Wow.  Lunch bags.  Plenty of those.  Lunch bags.  Yeah.  We had lunch bags.  That would have been a luxury.  This is white privilege, people.  Gear up.  Gear up.  It had a big S on it.  Oh, shithead.  As to not get...  No.  For sucks?  Shithead?  Stupid?  No.  Now, you bought them with S's on it?  No.  My mom put an S on it.  She drew an S on every...  But I bet you it wasn't just a quick S, was it now?  It was calligraphy on each one. 
[03:08:30]  Right.  It took weeks.  It was a quick S, but a neat S.  Okay.  You know.  She should put an A and then another S.  See, because you are one.  How are you going to confuse your lunch with someone else's?  Exactly.  Who else's would it be?  Who else likes a baggie of cum?  Sam was eating cum for lunch.  Yeah.  You would hate when the bottom of the bag would get all, like, fucking dark because it meant  the cum was leaking out.  Socky.  It was just to not confuse it with my sibling's lunch.  Oh, okay.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  And then it was a nice, fluffy white bread.  Either peanut butter or peanut butter and jelly.  Because she would always...  It's not lunch.  That's like cake.  She would always do it with love, but also made sure that my tastes...  You know, she knew my particular take-dicky, little fucking finicky.  Little finicky.  Little fuss budget.  After a while, my mom didn't even know her name.  It was so mad.  You know your parents should have done when you were a baby.  They should have crushed up whatever food they wanted and then put it on your mouth  and then pressed it in with the heel of their foot. 
[03:09:30]  So it was either one of those sandwiches or it could be a special leftover chicken...  No, I don't eat bologna.  Leftover chicken fingers or a nice chicken sandwich made of leftover chicken from dinner  the night before.  That's a good line.  Then a bag of chips.  Baggy of carrots.  Ew, what a dope.  Oh, you sat there in the cafeteria.  I would have punched you.  Why?  Look, he's eating carrots.  Hit him.  Why a baggy of carrots? 
[03:10:00]  That was like after he was eating his lunch.  If he wanted little things to put in his hiney, he would put the carrots.  Do you think he would shove one carrot at a time up his hiney hole?  Yes, and they weren't like the little pieces.  They were full carrots.  He would go back-to-back carrot-ing, if you know what I mean.  Oh, your little bag of carrots.  What a douchebag.  A fruit.  See, but yours is worse with the packet of chocolate milk.  No, that shit was great.  That's chocolate powder to make your own chocolate milk.  It was like I had drugs, too, because all the kids would be like,  could I have just a little bit of it to put in my milk? 
[03:10:30]  Nice.  And I'm like, no.  So you're bagging carrots and what else?  A juice box, usually Capri Sun.  A juice box?  Juice.  Oh, yeah.  It's different.  What flavor?  Usually orange.  Sunny D.  High school, by the way.  With your diverse friends.  Or looking into the fridge.  Yeah.  Except for the black guy.  He's taking care of Miss Roberts in the other room.  While the fucking Spanish-Asian kid and Sam look in.  Where's the black guy?  Miss Roberts fucking howling with joy. 
[03:11:00]  Getting her own Sunny D.  Exactly.  Yes.  That's right.  And then, of course, a little something sweet.  Usually my mom's candy of choice.  Should it be like a lollipop like they described yesterday at the strip club?  No.  Something sweet.  My mom liked Twix.  Yeah.  So she would put a Twix in.  Oh, those are the best.  Twix are good.  Fuck, man.  Twix bars rule.  Yeah.  Let's get some right now.  I'd love one.  That's the only candy with the cookie crunch. 
[03:11:30]  True.  Brother Joe wants in on this.  Oh, Joey.  We did free lunch for a long time, man.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, he said it.  We were on welfare.  I brought that up.  Yeah, well, what I used to do was I would sell as many free lunches as I could and get  the money together and buy a baggie of weed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And roll and sell doobies individually.  That was pretty much the way I got through.  Joe got busted for weed in junior high, which was really fucked up.  That really fucked everything up. 
[03:12:00]  I was out on the field and I had a little baggie and I ate it.  And the other teacher saw me eating it and I had green teeth and I'm denying it, like  up and down, just denying the fact that I had weed on me.  And some tough guys, it was tough guys that I got the weed from, so I had to keep my mouth  shut.  I couldn't say anything.  Yeah, and then I had to deal with the fucking fallout from that.  Like when I got into that junior high, like my teacher was like, I hope that didn't have 
[03:12:30]  any influence on you.  Like, shh, shh, no, I'm a little geeky kid.  You found that growing plants in the woods that night.  Yeah.  I had to get you out of that one.  We actually, yeah, I said that it was another kid that killed all these nice plants that  were growing these bugs.  I found marijuana in the woods and I grabbed them out of the ground and I said, look, my  marijuana, I'll destroy it.  And I started stomping.  Yeah, what a dude. 
[03:13:00]  Joe's looking out the window crying.  I'll destroy them.  I was doing my part.  Your father was right.  You were the doll stepping on the pot plants.  All that went toward my playing guitar, having plenty of spare time, which I'll be doing Friday  at the Patchogue Emporium.  Patchogue Emporium Friday.  Your plugs are becoming very smooth. 
[03:13:30]  Very good, Joe.  Yeah.  Found them right out there.  I'm learning how to do it.  I'm learning how to do it.  All right, Joe.  20 years.  See you later, boys.  Later, man.  I forgot also, I did have a little thing of like Mott's applesauce in there, too.  Oh, but you don't get punched.  No, kids had applesauce.  They brought out applesauce.  No, I brought out carrot sticks.  Your lunch is close to Sam's.  No, it wasn't a kick-his-ass lunch.  That's a kick-your-ass thing to do.  There's a lot of love in your lunch and Sam's lunch. 
[03:14:00]  There was.  A lot of love.  Carrots are punch you in the face.  So is the soup.  No.  Thermos full of soup.  People were like, oh, man, that's cool.  He's got hot soup.  Nobody said that.  Hot soup.  No one says that.  No one said they did.  They didn't say it's cool.  They didn't think carrots were cool.  Of course not.  It's not like, oh, man, you've got fucking Campbell's chicken noodle soup right here.  Thermos of soup is not cool.  It was cool.  It might be delicious and all that, but I don't.  On a fucking Lost in Space thermos?  No.  There's a shit right there.  Baggy of carrots. 
[03:14:30]  Carrots.  You've got to get a vegetable in.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  So I hope you'll put a fucking kid in a wheelchair in your lunchbox.  Long way to go for that dumb wordplay joke.  Let's go home.  Terry Schiavo.  Smack.  Exactly.  I'm going to have a Schiavo.  She's dead.  Yes, she is.  We remember.  Let's get out of here.  I have to plug.  Jimmy, plug away, sir.  Plug away.  Virginia Beach, March 20th through 22nd. 
[03:15:00]  It's the last time I'm ever going there.  Virginia Beach, Funny Bone, Tampa, April 11 and 12th, Caroline, 24 through 27.  Oh, really?  Here in the Big Apple.  Nice.  And don't forget the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Wednesday is when we have a brand new podcast for the people out there.  Which is today.  All old school.  A lot of bits we just can't play anymore just because we don't have enough room to play them all.  Damn.  A lot of years of archives at this point.  So this week it's Kids Snooping. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  It's another great episode.  And like I said, if you can, go through iTunes so we get some bragging rights.  If not, just get the podcast.  That's fine.  You bastards.  Roland, you got something?  No, I'm good.  Why are you holding a mic like you want to talk?  I don't know.  I just play with it.  My bad.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments of today's show. </pre>
