<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with discussions surrounding the recent deaths of Carl Malden and the *Fargo* actor, which segued into a lengthy segment on the post-mortem surge in Michael Jackson's music sales.  The hosts discussed the impressive sales figures across various platforms, prompting a caller from Harlem to comment on the commercialization of Jackson's death.  Speculation about the circumstances surrounding Jackson's death followed, focusing on Propofol and including a call from an anesthesiologist ("Psycho Bob") detailing the drug's properties and risks.  Unsubstantiated rumors about Jackson's life, including claims about his father castrating him, were also discussed.  Other celebrity deaths, including those of Dick Clark and Ed McMahon, were mentioned, and the hosts noted the overall increase in celebrity deaths that year. Numerous listener calls, some related to Michael Jackson and others on unrelated topics (like heart surgery), punctuated the segment.  The recurring joke about Bobo's impending appearance and controversial new comedy bit continued throughout. The hosts also touched upon their own pre-holiday work slowdown.

The show then shifted to a humorous anecdote about a friend's visit, which transitioned into a conversation about estate planning and government asset seizure, accompanied by exaggerated, morbid sound effects.  This led to a planned radio bit about "bad best man speeches," using audio clips from Gorilla Mask.  The hosts critiqued the speeches, interjecting their own jokes.  A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a top 10 candy bar ranking, featuring vulgar language and humorous asides.  This segued into a critique of recent, perceived offensive Snickers advertising.  Most significantly, the hosts aired their anger and frustration over SiriusXM's removal of Jimmy Norton's promotional spots, viewing it as unfair treatment due to Norton's contributions.  The discussion detailed the conflict with management, including a meeting between Norton and management, and expressed uncertainty about the future.  This segment included guest appearances by Jimmy Norton, Bobo (who suggested a new radio bit), and Sam Roberts, who provided backstage reports on intern reactions to a recent contest.

The next segment focused on the hosts' professional strategies, including their use of controversial content for promotional purposes and a cost-effectiveness comparison of free versus paid advertising.  They critically discussed their agent, "Bob," and his management style.  A significant portion recounted an incident where they used "Live from the Compound" to harass a Latina relationship advice show host whose phone number was visible on air, leading to numerous calls overwhelming her show.  Comedic bits included a listener's crush on Opie, playful banter between Jimmy and Anthony via email, the death of their accountant (who told awful jokes), the "How Much" segment (absurd calculations using foreskins), and a highly inappropriate discussion about Bobo's alleged new girlfriend, including graphic fictionalized accounts of possible rape by his brother, discussions of his sexuality and a list of men he would sleep with if gay, and multiple impersonations and comedic interruptions.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a magazine subscription scam their mother fell victim to.

Finally, Bobo appeared as a guest, recounting crude jokes about bodily fluids and hotel room messes, stories about his childhood (including a graduation day obscenity), stealing from hotels, his nonchalant attitude towards his high school diploma, and his misspellings on it. He also discussed his Fourth of July plans, which included sexually suggestive references.  Bobo promoted his upcoming comedy shows, and the hosts concluded with further crude jokes about fireworks and bodily harm.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Pretty much everybody on the XM side except for a handful of us.  A handful.  Who else is in this building that was from XM?  I can't name one person outside our show.  Besides Rana Fez.  Right, of course.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  That's what I'm getting at.  And I don't mean the ridiculous hires that, you know, those people that don't really show up.  I guess we're lucky.  We're lucky that we made the cut. 
[00:00:30]  We're so lucky.  Thank you, Sirius.  Thank you so much.  We're so lucky.  We're so lucky.  Greg of Long Island.  Greg!  Hey, how you doing?  I just heard on the news that Opie just killed Carl Malden.  Yeah.  Supposedly he died of natural causes, but I'm suspicious.  Well, how could you be suspicious?  He was 97.  Six.  Jesus, 96.  Yeah.  Well, I did announce that 2009 would be the year of the celebrity death. 
[00:01:00]  And so far, I think I've done quite well with this prediction.  This is getting full up.  Yeah.  I was saying that that Academy Award moment where they go through the dead people, it's  going to take an hour.  It's going to be half the show.  Yeah.  They're all going to be like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Who do we clap the most for?  Carl Malden will get the smattering.  And then, you know, Michael Jackson gets the biggest, I think.  Well, I said Dick Clark would be the next celebrity to go. 
[00:01:30]  But I guess as far as the next surprise celebrity.  Yeah.  I mean, Carl Malden dying is not a surprise to anyone.  He was in his 90s.  No.  You know, I'm still going with Dick Clark.  An old guy.  Another death that was overshadowed.  The guy that played Wade in Fargo.  What?  Yeah.  Wade?  Why don't you go down to the bank?  See old Bill Deal.  Bill Deal.  Bill Deal.  We're not a bank.  He's dead? 
[00:02:00]  He's dead.  Why are we getting clips of him?  Where's my daughter?  We should do a whole Sarah.  Oh, we certainly should.  We should do a whole Sarah McLachlan with him.  Yeah.  I mean, he was in a lot of movies, but of course Fargo was his biggest.  Always playing just a scumbag.  The heavy.  Just the old scumbaggy guy.  Yeah.  And, yep, apparently dead.  Of what?  He was no kid either.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, Fargo came out at least 10 years ago now.  Yeah, Fargo's old.  He was old, innit?  Yeah.  Oh, we ain't no bank. 
[00:02:30]  So we lost Wade?  A finder's fee?  Well, that's just not going to do it for me, Wade.  Boy, I hope you don't mind if we move on it.  They just fucked him over so bad.  God damn it.  Now you're going to make me watch that movie again.  I had to fucking play the clip last night, like that clip of him asking for the money.  Yeah.  Go see old Bill Deal down the bank.  Bill Deal.  And I just pictured that old cranky fuck and Bill Deal talking about how they've just fucked 
[00:03:00]  people out of money over the years.  Yeah, I'm going down to see Bill Deal.  Good old Bill Deal.  All right.  So we lost Carl Malden and Wade.  And Wade.  Oh, Wade.  That's sadder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So two more celebrities are dead.  Carl Malden was just, he had two big things.  It was Streets of San Francisco.  Yes.  It was Michael, a very young Michael Douglas.  Mm-hmm.  And the Don't Leave Home Without Them American Express Traveler's Checks commercials.  And that was it.  Which were parodied a lot on like the Tonight Show. 
[00:03:30]  Johnny Carson used to dress up like Carl Malden and go, and do one of his catchphrases.  Like, if you're the victim of a robbery or something like that, and then a pie would hit  him in the face out of nowhere.  It was the dumbest thing, but hysterical funny.  It was a good parody.  Johnny Carson with all the makeup on and the giant Carl Malden nose.  Right.  Holding up an American Express thing and then just getting a pie.  Fuck it.  And they wing it at his face. 
[00:04:00]  Ugh.  Shit was funny, man.  Hell yeah.  I got that Carson collection.  Did you ever wind up getting that?  I did not.  DVDs?  Goddamn funny fucking shit.  You know what?  I should pick that one up.  Yeah.  Just like classic oldie time talk show hijinks.  I would absolutely enjoy it.  Yeah.  You see them all coming out smoking and drinking.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dino and Frank.  They would just come out.  They wouldn't even be announced.  Like, Johnny's halfway through his little thing after the monologue, but before the guests. 
[00:04:30]  And there they come.  Just out clinking drinks and cigarettes.  How you doing, Johnny?  We were in the neighborhood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And everybody's like, oh, yeah.  He goes, well, sit down.  And then they would just talk about, like, Vegas.  Who knocked on whose door?  The famous Bing Crosby, David Bowie video that we always reference.  Well, someone's at the door.  Oh.  I'm in the neighborhood.  I decided to stop by.  Perhaps it's my son who needs a punch in the foot. 
[00:05:00]  Well, I think I'll beat the shit out of him.  He's got a stocking cap and brass knuckles.  Pa-rum-pa-pum.  Fargo, 13 years ago.  That was 13 years.  Kane survived the XM merger.  Ah.  And Sonny Fox survived the merger.  How about that?  And Eddie Trunk.  Yeah, but Eddie Trunk's like a part-timer, man.  Eddie Trunk is, and don't get this wrong, he's like the cockroach. 
[00:05:30]  There's no getting rid of Eddie Trunk.  No.  He will live forever.  He's impervious to all kinds of sprays.  I think what happens with Eddie Trunk, he talks so much that he just puts everyone to sleep  and they forgot that they were going to fire him.  Yeah, no one gets a word in edgewise.  No, Eddie, you're fu-  You're fu-  But you're fu-  We love Eddie, but boy, does he love to talk.  Oh, can that man talk?  The one-sided conversation, we all know that one, right? 
[00:06:00]  We all have one of those in our lives.  Well, I've been on the phone a few times going,  Oh, all right, well, yeah, I got a watch.  All right, uh-huh, yeah, right.  Yeah, oh, well, you know something, I'm just looking at my watch, and I got-  Huh?  Why?  Sure.  Yeah.  But those guys are experts at the one-sided conversation, though.  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter if you're standing there.  Because you think, all right, I'll just interrupt them, and this will be over with, and I'll hang  up the phone.  But you don't know when to interrupt.  You try to interrupt, and you find yourself stopping in the middle of your interruption, 
[00:06:30]  and they just continue and continue.  I have put phones down and walked around my entire apartment for a minute or two.  Really?  And picked it back up and just go, uh-huh, oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I got it.  And they're still just going and going and going.  Yeah.  This was an argument we started yesterday.  I guess it continues today.  Sir?  Yeah, it's Matt in Harlem.  Hey, Matt.  How are you, buddy?  Good, man.  I'm about less than a 10-minute walk from the Apollo Theater.  And I have to say, yesterday, when you guys- I listened to the replay, and when you guys 
[00:07:00]  were out talking about there being a celebration, you know, by the Apollo and, you know, doing  a whole Michael Jackson retrospective, I went out there, and I have to say, the black people,  the reason why they like Michael Jackson, again, the reason why they're adhering to  him, is because they're making money off of his dead body.  No worse than what Joe Jackson is doing, but of course, you know, Joe Jackson is a fire  beat him.  But they're selling merchandise, and that's all they care about. 
[00:07:30]  That's all they care about.  They're selling CDs, bootlegged- Oh, is that what's going on up there?  Oh, really?  There's a whole, like- A little industry.  A little- A little industry.  Harlem industry going on.  Yeah, buttons.  And the next big black celebrity that dies, they're just going to make money off his merchandise.  Buttons and shirts and the like on all the streets up there?  Because that's kind of what happened when Obama got elected.  You can't walk to the next block without being bombarded by a table, you know, a makeshift 
[00:08:00]  table with shit.  It's just ridiculous.  Unbelievable.  Well, Michael Jackson has been dead how long?  Was it a week ago today?  Thursday, right?  Last Thursday, I believe?  Yeah.  Okay, so it's been a week.  I got a little trivia quiz for everybody.  Oh, I love trivia.  For Ant and Jimmy and you on the phone, sir.  All right.  So, week ending June 28th.  How many days ago was that?  Oh, boy.  Well, it's the second.  Jackson died on what day in June? 
[00:08:30]  Summer solstice.  Kind of important because you know those numbers I gave you before the show, Ant?  Yeah.  That's freaking...  That's not even for a week.  Wow.  Holy shit.  So, Jackson died June what?  It would be June 25th.  Get the fuck out of here.  For real?  For real, yo.  So, these stats that I'm about to give you is for three...  Why is this guy sprinting down the hall?  It's like a week old.  Oh.  All right.  He was being chased.  These stats I'm about to give you are for three to maybe four days. 
[00:09:00]  Not even a week.  So, here's my question.  How many...  How many...  How do I do this?  Let me think.  All right.  Let's start with this.  How many Thriller albums were sold after Michael Jackson died?  Eight.  And this isn't all the way up to today.  These stats end June 28th.  So, it's three to four days after he died.  How many Thriller albums were sold? 
[00:09:30]  Because he's dead.  I'm going to have to go with 422,000.  Jesus.  Way overbidding.  Yeah, you overbid there.  I mean, you're out.  You're out.  I'm going to say they've sold an additional 200 copies of Thriller.  200 copies?  I tend to think low.  You're actually closer than the guy on the phone.  Cool.  So, you're in the lead.  And Anthony already knows the answer.  I already know.  The high schoolers voted boy most likely to guess correctly.  What did Jimmy say?  200.  200.  I'm going to say 201. 
[00:10:00]  201.  Oh, no.  Did I hit it on the head?  The Price is Right scumbag move I just pulled.  Oh, no.  The one where the person wants to reach over and just belt the motherfucker in the face.  Jackson dies the first three to four days after his death.  They sold 101,000 more copies of Thriller.  That's amazing.  In three or four days.  But that's not the number one album that was sold three or four days after he died.  No, huh?  The Essential Michael Jackson sold 102,000 copies in the first three or four days after his death. 
[00:10:30]  And number ones, obviously, his greatest hits of CD.  Yeah.  108,000 copies were sold.  Amazing.  The first three or four days after he died.  And then it goes from there.  Off the wall, 33,000.  And then it drops down from there.  Digital track downloads.  Individual songs.  What is that you're talking about?  Individual songs.  That sounds like the future.  Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, right? 
[00:11:00]  Michael Jackson dies.  Mm-hmm.  The first three or four days, they sold 125,000 copies of the song Don't Stop Till You Get Enough.  What is that?  Like two bucks a pop, right?  I don't know what it is now.  Where?  It's getting up there.  It's getting up there.  Depends.  Yeah.  Beat It sold 134,000.  The Way You Make Me Feel, 136,000.  And Billie Jean, 158,000 copies.  Man in the Mirror, 164,000 copies of that were downloaded after his death. 
[00:11:30]  The first three or four days.  This isn't even a week of sales.  And Thriller, 167,000 copies were downloaded the first three or four days after his death.  Isn't that amazing how they actually got people to pay for music?  No, I know.  Like for the longest time, you would just download shit.  The lawyers were smart.  And then everyone got...  Because they made an example out of a few people and scared the shit out of the rest  of us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, people still, believe me, getting free music. 
[00:12:00]  They're not like it used to be.  Not like...  Yeah.  Now, you know what it is, too?  It's so convenient to just hit it on your phone and you go, all right.  They made it incredibly easier to get music quickly.  Yeah, quickly.  So it's worth the price.  I can still get everything I can get on iTunes.  But then, you know, I have that...  You know, maybe the quality isn't there.  Right.  Maybe it's labeled wrong and going on iTunes or even just right from your phone and downloading  the track directly to your phone.  Yeah.  And I'm listening to it literally within 10 seconds.  I know. 
[00:12:30]  You can't get that anywhere else.  That's the biggest thing.  That's what you're paying for is the convenience of, you know, popping that on.  And I use that goddamn Shazam app all the time where you just hit it.  I'm driving home.  I'll hear a song on the radio and go, holy shit, I like this song.  I have no idea who does it.  You hit that Shazam app, hold the phone up to the radio.  It tells you what it is.  Would you like to download this?  Yes.  Wham!  You download it.  And there you go.  You know, you're paying...  You pay for a song you would have never... 
[00:13:00]  Never paid for.  It's 99 cents.  What the fuck, you know?  But you do that, like, you look at your catalog of songs you have and you realize how many  99 cents you paid?  You're like, fuck, I did this 50 times in the last month?  It's like 50 a month or, you know, I spent like, you know, $1,500 on music.  Yeah.  This guy's saying he's making a killing selling Michael Jackson CDs.  I'm telling you, we said this early on that, you know, a dead Michael Jackson is worth 
[00:13:30]  way more than a live one.  Yeah.  Jeremy and Cleveland.  For other people.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I have made an absolute killing selling these CDs down in the ghetto in Cleveland.  The ghetto.  I moved about 200 copies of Off the Wall, probably 100 of Thriller, 300 of Bad.  How are you getting them?  What are you, burning them or something?  Yeah.  I got, like, four computers just running simultaneously, burning all these CDs.  You thief. 
[00:14:00]  You fucking pirate.  It's called being an entrepreneur, man.  It's called being a pirate.  You're a pirate.  He's an entrepreneur.  Come on.  There you go.  I like this guy.  You're a go-getter.  Tomato, tomato, man.  It's still making money.  Yeah.  People are just eating up this Michael Jackson stuff.  All of us.  I can't get enough of it.  I get mad when CNN starts doing regular news.  I'm like, fuck that shit.  What's the latest going on with this Michael Jackson thing?  What you doing?  What you doing?  I guess...  I probably made about $1,200 this weekend alone just moving these discs. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, whatever it takes, man.  You got bills to pay, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, shoot.  I already paid my bills.  This is just plain money.  How's the Ed McMahon merchandise moving?  What Ed McMahon merchandise?  A little slow.  A little slower.  Farrah Fawcett.  Farrah Fawcett.  Uh, anything?  No.  I guess I could sell some Charlie Angels.  Charlie's Angels posters, maybe.  Yeah, how well is the Ed McMahon clips, the audio clips selling above 110th Street?  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  In Cleveland, I'm sorry.  I love that hi-oh shit.  Hi-oh.  Hi-oh.  Hi-oh.  I got a ringtone.  Johnny said that motherfucking drink too much.  Nice.  All right, Jeremy.  Good for you.  Good for you, guys.  What is the latest on Michael Jackson?  I saw they were delivering a lot of cement to the Neverland Ranch.  Really?  And that can only mean one thing.  Why?  Yeah, they want to bury him there and make it very hard for anyone to just get the body  out.  Wow. 
[00:15:30]  They said the amount of cement was ridiculous that was being delivered to Neverland Ranch.  They're going to encase him in concrete?  But not, well, a mausoleum.  Ah.  But now they're saying that he's not allowed to be buried there.  Is that what they're saying?  Because I heard, all I heard, I didn't hear anything about him.  I heard about the people, that they don't want to have like a ceremony for him there.  Right.  With a bunch of people.  Because remember, they were going to all go out there and big pilgrimage and it's going 
[00:16:00]  to be great.  We had fun with that yesterday.  Of course.  But now they're saying, no, no, they were going to probably do something at the Staples  Center.  Holy shit.  Where he was rehearsing.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson dead.  Holy shit.  Is going to sell out an arena.  Well, you know what?  I'm not even thinking of that.  I mean, let's think LA Lakers just won the NBA title.  Uh-huh.  And the celebration was, Michael Jackson at the Staples Center sold out.  What?  Sold out death show. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  That's going to get crazy.  I don't think a Michael Jackson, like, crowd is that crazy, though.  I don't think they're that, like, crazy.  I'm just going to get crazy.  A lot of guys you see that are into Michael Jackson seem to be gay.  Like, you see a lot of women out there and they're crying and shit.  Michael, oh, Michael, I love that Michael.  You don't think any hardcore gangsters are going to the Michael Jackson show?  No, you see a lot of guys that go, well, I was watching him dance many years ago and 
[00:17:00]  I think Michael's was fantastic, fabulous.  You know, that's like...  Did you ever watch Michael Jackson dance?  We all went, wow, that moonwalk thing is fucked up.  Let me try that.  Moonwalk thing's all fucking...  And that was it?  Yeah.  That was it?  You tried it?  We all tried it.  You never tried the moonwalk?  Well, maybe.  Of course you did.  I don't think there's a human alive that didn't try that fucking thing.  All right, so is it like this? 
[00:17:30]  You show your friends and they're like, ugh.  Yeah.  No, it's not like that at all.  Has there been a spike in Mighty Putty sales?  Oh, very good question.  Are they selling bootleg Mighty Putty?  Dan?  Awesome.  I'll do some research.  You're going to do some research?  I'll do some research.  So I think a funeral at the Stable Center is going to be completely out of hand.  Yeah?  Yeah, because not everyone's going to get in.  People are going to travel from all over the country for this thing.  It's next Tuesday, I believe.  It just amazes me. 
[00:18:00]  It's going to be out of hand.  There's going to be a lot of people just wandering around because they can't get in there.  It's going to cause problems.  Yeah.  I still hold to my prediction that a few people die at the Michael Jackson funeral.  Wow, you think?  Still, even though it's a little more controlled because they're having it at the Stable Center.  I don't know, man.  It might just be a sad event that people just walk away from kind of reflecting.  No, I was saying earlier, there has not been any show of grief at anything that's gone on concerning Michael Jackson. 
[00:18:30]  They've been these celebrations, dancing, and all the news is covering it like, oh, he's so fantastic, wasn't he?  Watch it.  Look at him dance.  This is just great.  Like, there's been no somber moments with him being dead.  No.  Everyone's loving it.  Oh, they're all lying.  Party time.  Yeah, kids are running around with their little hineys showing.  No one's afraid anymore.  Little rumps all over.  There's hats with little rumps on them.  Dude, the playgrounds are packed.  Yeah.  We can play again.  Yeah, the children have come out to play. 
[00:19:00]  And everyone's lining up for their taste of the Michael Jackson fortune.  Oh, yeah.  So the families don't care.  The friends don't care.  Friends are covering their tracks because, you know, everyone's sniffing around going, what the fuck killed this guy?  Yeah.  And who are we going to arrest?  Supposedly needle marks all over his body.  Dozens of them.  The feds are in it now, in the investigation.  Oh, yeah.  The feds.  Well, because he was...  Did you hear the drug he was on?  What the fuck is...  It's a drug they use to put you under? 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  And they say...  Go to TMZ.  They say it's extremely dangerous.  What is it?  Extremely.  Is it like an anesthesia?  Yes.  Kind of like for surgery?  And they're saying that he...  It's a general anesthesia?  Oh, wow.  They're starting to say he might have been using this kind of on a regular basis.  Wow.  It's the type of shit they give you to knock you the fuck out so you don't remember what they're doing to your body.  He had an insomnia.  What the hell is it called?  I'll find it.  It is extreme. 
[00:20:00]  Extremely...  I can't remember what it was.  Yeah, they find ethyl in there somewhere.  It's like an Ambien, you retard.  It's extremely...  Propofol.  Yeah.  This drug is extremely dangerous.  They're scared to use it in doctor's offices.  I think that's the stuff that doesn't make you vomit.  I'm almost positive that's what I had for my sinus surgery.  Absolutely you did.  Because there's two kinds.  There's one that you're really going to throw up, and they say that cuts down on nausea.  I could be wrong.  I remember taking that.  They say, man, when they're administering this drug, they are...  They're almost scared to put it in you. 
[00:20:30]  They have to make sure they don't fuck up.  And supposedly, you know, he was being injected with this stuff at his house.  At his house.  Amazing.  To get a nice little fucking, you know, sleep, I guess.  Yeah, because he said he couldn't sleep.  He was an insomniac.  What are the facts on that, Dan?  You got it in front of you.  Well, it says here that medical experts tell TMZ that there is absolutely no medical justification  for Jackson to have had this drug in his home.  It is used to knock people out before surgery, and it's administered through an IV. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  We're told Jackson wanted the drug to sleep and that he had cravings for anesthesia.  Whenever he had even the most minor medical procedure, he had the doctor put him under.  Holy shit.  Okay, I'm going to give you this drug now.  Count the ages of the children you love.  Ten, nine, eight.  No, because he would go ten, three, two, I'm still awake. 
[00:21:30]  And then he goes, that's the wrong way to phrase that.  Count up.  When are they too old?  Seven, eight.  I love numbers jokes.  Of course, who doesn't?  Give me those ribs, you.  We got an anesthesiologist on the phone.  Oh.  Psycho Bob, that's what you do for a living?  Yeah, that's what I do.  What the fuck?  You call us all the time.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  I don't know if I want a Psycho Bob there.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's what I'm getting at.  Do you tell them to me?  Anthony, I'd love to put you under. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  Oh, sounds sexy.  Do you tell them, hey, I'm Psycho Bob right as you put the thing over their face?  Oh, God.  Good night.  Yes, exactly.  I'm the angel of death.  Oh, shit.  What a great joke that would be.  How horrible would that be?  Yeah.  As you, like, once you push the thing in the IV, you should stroke their cheek with the  back of your hand and go, you're never going to wake up.  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  Oh, is that horrible?  Fuck that.  I never want to be put under. 
[00:22:30]  Never.  You never put under?  Fuck no.  Oh, dude.  Oh, fucking no.  It's the most bizarre thing.  Bob started it.  But my last time I got my sinus surgery, I'm laying there, and it's very cold in an operating  room.  I walk in.  I'm happy because I'm getting my surgery.  So I'm laying there, and they're like, you're in a good mood.  I'm like, well, I'm getting this.  And the IV is in.  So what they do is they inject the IV with the drug.  And my doctor walks in, and he's whistling.  And he said something, and I'm like, well.  And I woke up in the recovery room.  Oh, my God.  And that was the end of it.  It's like going to a Voss gig. 
[00:23:00]  You have no concept of time going by?  None.  I woke up, and you feel a little queasy.  I puked a little, but it's not a horrible puke.  It's a very quick puke, and you're done.  Well.  I was all ready to chat.  I was like, you know, goodbye.  You're completely powerless over it.  God damn.  And this is what Michael Jackson was doing in his home.  Oh, my God.  Bob, is Propothol, is that what it's called?  Yeah, it's got two names, Diprovan and Propofol.  And it's what Pentothol used to be. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, sodium Pentothol.  It's a very short-acting medication.  Like, once you give it, it works in about, like, 10, 15 seconds.  But it also wears off very quickly.  And you're out, all right?  But you've got to give it continuously if you want to stay asleep for a long time.  If he wants to be asleep for hours, somebody's got to be giving it to him for hours.  How long does it work?  I'm sure, though, if you take it, right, if you just take a little shot to get high,  I'm sure that the feeling fucked up, like, you can't get operated on it for long, but 
[00:24:00]  you probably still feel a little messed up for a while, right?  It's actually a pretty clean drug in that it wears off very quickly.  How long?  And I don't think you get high.  It just kind of knocks you out.  It doesn't make you high at all.  Is this going to last forever?  How long does it last, Bob?  Go.  Minutes.  Really?  Go.  What, do you need a constant, like, drip?  Yeah, you need to make it last for a long time.  You need a continuous infusion.  You've got to be getting it continuous.  Yeah, but if you get an injection, I mean, you're out for a couple hours, though, right? 
[00:24:30]  Because Jimmy was out for a couple hours.  No, they must have had the guy monitoring a drip.  It must have been a drip.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I mean, really, it lasts only a couple minutes, and then it's worn off.  Wow, what the fuck?  I should have went with the other one.  Is this the one that cuts down on sickness a little bit?  It does help prevent nausea, but what happens is he uses it as part of a cocktail.  It's only one part of it.  Because probably, Jimmy, you've got medication for pain relief and also something that lasts a little bit longer. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  You just don't use just that.  So Michael Jackson had this in his home.  What's the scenario?  I mean, walk us through this.  It's not something that you would want to use at home.  I mean, you really have to have a patient who's monitored very closely because the major side effect is that it not only knocks you out, but it also depresses your respirations, so you stop breathing.  And breathing's overrated.  But this guy...  No, you need to breathe, dude. 
[00:25:30]  A literal gym.  But everyone's saying...  I've seen you in a while.  Everyone is saying that this just should not have been in this home.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a drug that you have to have a patient monitor.  Hence the DDA looking into...  How they're breathing, their oxygen in their blood, their cardiogram, their blood pressure.  That's all should be monitored when you're giving the medication.  Yeah, I don't think that was gone.  I think when this autopsy report comes out, and I don't think the L.A. coroner's office could hide any of these facts because, you know, they've been in trouble over the years.  I think it's just going to be amazing when that thing is red. 
[00:26:00]  What the fuck was going on with this guy and how it died.  The other thing is that it does have to be given intravenously.  So, I mean, it's not something you can give as a shot, like in a muscle or take it as a pill.  It is an intravenous medication.  Yeah.  Another shocker from the autopsy was the fact that Michael Jackson had what they described as just patches of peach fuzz on his head.  He was just bald. 
[00:26:30]  So, that's real now?  He was bald, yeah.  Because we talked about it on the show, but then they were saying that maybe that wasn't true.  No, that's what they were saying.  Was that a wig he wore?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was ridiculous.  You saw that hair.  It was, you know, the same hair for years.  Right, right.  That's straight frigging, I call it the Cornelius.  Well, maybe he got hair plugs like you did.  No, I don't think you can, unless you're getting separate donors.  He's inviting people in, killing them, and making their donor hair. 
[00:27:00]  But his brothers, they all have their hair, so, you know, they're saying...  No, a couple of his other brothers were...  Kind of bald?  Kind of bald-ish.  Oh, okay.  But they said he might have lost a lot of hair from stress and, you know, and all the shit he was into.  Or maybe, you know, the wig glue.  Right.  He was ripping it out of his head.  Well, Psycho Bob, thank you so much.  Okay, good talking to you, boys.  All right, PB.  A little knowledge from Psycho Bob today.  Who knew?  Stryker.  SP, stupid.  Psycho Bob. 
[00:27:30]  Psycho's a P.  Oh, literal.  I shot twice in a row.  Hello?  Stryker!  Stryker.  Stryker.  What's up, Stryker?  Yeah.  Every day since Jackson has died, my wife has either watched or DVR'd some fucking Michael  Jackson program on TV.  Oh, God.  She has broken out all of her Michael Jackson cassettes and CDs that were, like, collecting  dust in a drawer, and they're all in her car.  She's been listening to them every day. 
[00:28:00]  Poor bastard.  And the XM unit in her car is set to the, apparently, all Michael Jackson, all KidToucher channel.  Yeah, there's a tribute channel that's running.  I don't know what number, and I'm not giving them a plug.  You'll find it if you don't care.  Yeah, I'm not either.  And I am to the point now of where I told her that I want one peaceful day of no Michael  Jackson, or I may die.  Oh, you're in hell, Stryker.  Oh, let me tell you, I never liked Michael Jackson. 
[00:28:30]  I couldn't stand his music.  Couldn't stand him.  And I'm just in hell.  It's ridiculous.  You know what?  I'm starting to feel like a KidToucher.  His music, take it or leave it.  Every once in a while, I'm like, cool, Michael Jackson's song is on the radio or whatever.  But as far as a freak show goes, man, I've followed all that over the years.  That guy was a lunatic.  You forget about the elephant man's body and all the other shit he did. 
[00:29:00]  The fucking sleep chamber he had, the fucking chimp.  They showed the chimp on TV today, Bubbles or whatever.  Oh, Bubbles.  Bubbles is an old, angry chimp that's ready to rip someone's fucking face off.  And nuts and feet and everything else.  Bubbles looks exactly like the chimp that ripped people apart.  Yeah.  He looks like he wants that at somebody.  And they show the old Bubbles footage where it's just little Bubbles in a little engineer outfit.  Yeah, a tiny, cute little fucking chimp.  Like he's going to drive a little chimp train. 
[00:29:30]  Right, right.  And there he is.  But it said you're all waiting at the station and he's throwing shit through a fucking...  Oh yeah, he is just a chimp.  Just looking, tapping your watch.  All angry and he's just throwing shit and masturbating.  I see the train and the conductor's right there reaching into his diapers.  I'm going to be late again, Bill.  We have to take another train.  Why do they insist on making these monkeys the engineers?  I don't understand it.  God damn, they look cute in the outfits.  But can't they be porters or do something that's not important? 
[00:30:00]  Ah, nice.  By the way, Stryker hung up.  I wanted to tell him that he sounds a bit like Bill Hicks.  I never noticed that before.  Love the Bill Hicks.  Let's go to Dan in Kansas.  Dan.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, my mom just had bypass surgery.  And she was out for like, I don't know, seven or eight days on that fucking DepriVan.  Seven or eight days?  Morphine.  Yeah, they probably wanted to keep her under, you know. 
[00:30:30]  Morphine.  That sounds like an induced coma.  Well, yeah, that's exactly what it was.  Only they call it a medical state of paralysis.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do that from time to time.  That's like what our executive producer has.  How weird would it be?  I get it.  I'm gay.  No, that was a do-nothing joke.  Oh.  Yeah.  There's two ways you could go with Steve.  The do-nothing and then the gay.  There's the two ways.  Men and boys.  Oh, there's the gay. 
[00:31:00]  Yes, now I'm gay.  I get it.  I always say, a few people saying that Michael Jackson lost his hair after the Pepsi commercial.  No.  No, I think it grew back, right?  I think most of that shit grew back.  Hello.  How am I fine?  James, Virginia.  Hey, my little two-year-old boy's been walking around all week going, hee-hee.  And I asked my wife, I was like, where's he getting that from?  And she said, from the TV.  See that?  He got it from the TV.  TV.  Yep. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Thank you, James.  You mean they ate each other up?  So, no public viewing at Neverland.  Funeral at the Staples Center Tuesday.  Probably.  That's the public one.  The DEA's involved.  Yeah, DEA's involved looking into who gave him these drugs, where he got them, the prescriptions,  the doctors that administered them, all that shit.  The feds don't have to adhere to that patient, doctor-patient privilege. 
[00:32:00]  So, if there's some shenanigans going on, they'll find out.  So, they found out something already with his autopsy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, they had.  Oh, that means this one's going to be a doozy.  All the needle marks and everything that were in them.  Yeah, there was something going on that was amiss.  You know, stupid me, I had no clue that Michael Jackson could be a drug addict.  No clue.  Really?  I thought he was just a completely bizarre dude.  Yeah.  Maybe a Xanax every once in a while or something.  To the dick.  To the youngsters.  Who knows?  Who knows? 
[00:32:30]  There he is.  Yeah.  You know, skin popping, as they call it.  Let me say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Jimmy, what's up?  I've been better.  Chris, I've been worse.  Kind of in the middle.  You know, I slept poorly.  How are you?  My eyes are a little...  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  Hey, last week I had heart surgery, ablation surgery, and they gave me this medicine that  put you into a twilight.  It's not exactly a deep sleep, but they said that it could wake you up. 
[00:33:00]  And three times during the operation, I woke up.  Into a twilight.  They give you a little extra to put you back.  You woke up during heart surgery?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I wanted to see what was going on, and all of a sudden...  No, you don't.  ...I came across this unbelievable pain, and they put you back out again.  What kind of heart surgery?  It's called ablation surgery.  It depicts an electrical abnormality in the heart, and they go up through the... 
[00:33:30]  You know, they use catheters.  Right.  But you don't want to wake up.  You feel better?  Yeah, much better.  Actually, I'm back to work already.  It's amazing.  But last week, heart surgery.  This week, back to work.  Amazing.  It's incredible.  Tell your boss to go fuck himself.  Hey, boss, I need a little more than a week off.  They just did something to my heart.  Yeah, well, you know...  These stupid broads have a baby.  They're out three months.  Poor Chris had heart surgery. 
[00:34:00]  He's back to work the next week.  How about heart leave?  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, man.  I'm glad you're feeling good.  All right, my friend.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  Later, man.  Yeah, they're saying Jackson can't be buried at Neverland because it's illegal,  but they're also saying that...  What's it illegal?  They're saying it's not illegal if he's cremated, though.  Right.  You can't just put a dead body there, I guess.  But if they cremate and make a big mausoleum...  They don't want a Graceland in that area. 
[00:34:30]  No?  Oh, the locals would be out of their minds.  Are there locals?  Well, they're all ranches, so they're...  Oh, right, right.  It's locals, but they're well-to-do, and they're spread apart pretty nicely.  Yeah.  Imagine they throw some kind of Graceland in there.  Oh, it's just a big winding road of backed-up traffic.  Watch your property value just go...  Ash just come in there to pay their respects.  Yep.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  Break time. 
[00:35:00]  We played this yesterday.  It did well, so we'll do it again.  Backstage with ONA.  Bobo is gay.  Is Bobo coming in today?  Yeah.  I hear he has a new bit.  Yeah, and he's bringing food, too.  From what?  Who's eating bad?  Nobody.  Who's eating Bobo's food?  Let's be real here.  I hear that he is here.  One second, actually.  Should we get him in?  No.  You don't like Bobo?  I like Bobo, but he just talks over everybody.  He's a nice dude, but...  Yeah, you can't even talk when he's in the room.  What's his deli called?  Dumpsters?  It's probably just some place he goes and... 
[00:35:30]  It's very good.  I'm always first online.  I just lift the lid.  It's not a deli, Bobo.  I just like the new thing we've picked up on.  Bobo.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-do-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, he's been teasing his new bit on Twitter, and I don't know what it is.  Has he said what it is?  He said it's better than the Bruce Springsteen jersey bit. 
[00:36:00]  I think it was his latest tweet.  He kind of gave it away.  I don't think he wrote me personally.  I think he wrote this to everybody.  He's Mr. Met 8, the number 8 on Twitter.  What does it say, Danny?  It sounds like his new bit is a ripoff.  Yeah, well, because he's pissed off because Kenny took his bit.  Well, the first statement that he makes is that he's not gay.  Right.  And then he says, one of my new bits is me showing how any slub.  Not a schlub.  No, a slub.  A slub.  Can DJ a music station.  If Kenny can do it, so can Bobo. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, a little competition.  Now he's talking about himself in the third person, too, which is really helpful.  That's a sure sign of mental stability.  When you stand in the mirror and refer to yourself in the third person.  So can Bobo.  Oh, you're nude below the waist.  Bobo knows.  All right, we got it, Bobo.  It's you.  Wow, this is a great rumor.  Ted in Connecticut.  Ted.  What's going on, boys?  How are you this morning?  Pretty good.  I've been better.  How are you? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Ted speaking to Ted.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I'm going to go see you at the end of the month of Middletown.  Oh, good.  Thanks, man.  All right, here's the deal.  Unless I have to move that because I got cast in a small film.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Back in the day, they used to castrate 13, 14, 15-year-old boys right as they were to  get into puberty to keep their high-pulsetto voice.  And there's a rumor going around on the Internet, some of the websites I go to, that Michael Jackson  Roberts did this to him.  And that's why he can't have kids.  That's why he never fully matured.  That's why his voice stayed high. 
[00:37:30]  You know what?  It makes a lot of sense.  I don't know if it's true, but it makes some sense.  It sort of makes sense, and I'll tell you why.  Because when you see those other Jackson boys, every once in a while they pop up, they  are men.  They are black men with voices and fucking, you know what I mean?  How?  And then you got Michael Jackson sounding like Janet Jackson and Diana Ross.  That his father had his nuts ripped off?  Yeah.  Wow.  My wife goes to the same shit the other caller with this Michael Jackson's expression, and 
[00:38:00]  I just had to go on the Internet and do some research, and I'm like, you know what?  The only thing that makes sense is that this guy got his nuts chopped off.  Would that come out in the autopsy report?  Because don't they just study the whole body?  Yes.  No, but would they say something like that?  Yeah, they would go, testicles, not present.  What, sir?  Can you say that again?  What, sir?  I think what has to happen is, I'm sure that it would probably happen.  Oh, interrupting Jim.  It would have come out already, because there's always been these medical tests.  Remember there was photos taken when the kid said that he could identify Michael's penis? 
[00:38:30]  That would have come out.  They photographed my penis, my testicles.  So is that what you heard?  Because I remember years ago when they had to take pictures of him.  Oh, no, not again.  Jesus.  God-like productions.  I'm punching out, boys.  Have fun.  All right, thank you, sir.  Well, it would make sense, because the one thing I don't understand, if he wanted to  be a father, why wouldn't he, you know, pass on his fucking sperm?  You know what? 
[00:39:00]  If you're going to be a father, wouldn't that be your first choice every time, obviously?  Again.  Unless you had some kind of issue.  He had an issue with his race.  The guy turned his back on his race.  He did not want to be a black man.  He did not want children that would then have his genes and a part of his African heritage.  So he got two white people to make babies, and they handed over to him.  Who else can do this in the world?  It's amazing what he's done.  This goes against what Reverend Al is saying, and you can't see this. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, I know.  Oh, this is crazy.  Shit on me.  Oh, this is another rumor.  The rumors are just flying.  I'm so glad that we're a show that will talk about the rumors.  Of course we are.  Have you watched CNN?  Yeah.  They say a lot.  They're like, well, we're not going to speculate or go with all the rumors that are out there.  We're just going to go with the facts.  Just the facts.  Well, here on the O.P. and Anthony Show, we go with the rumors big time.  Yeah.  Xavier, Mexico, what's up? 
[00:40:00]  It's not a rumor.  This is a fact, sir.  Yes.  He did not get his nuts cut off by his dad.  He got into a fight with his brothers, and we all know how they tend to rip each other's testicles off to show them.  Oh, no, sir.  Oh, wait.  That is completely unnecessary.  Oh, no.  Rumors are fine, but we won't have that type of statements made on this program, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Yes, yeah.  Well, not accepted.  My goodness.  We will be dealing with all the rumors today.  My goodness. 
[00:40:30]  You could start a nice one through Twitter if you want.  I got a doozy.  Oh, yeah?  I got a doozy that would...  How about we don't go with the rumor thing?  I got a doozy.  It's not about the demise of anybody, is it?  No.  I mean, if my rumor ends with a question mark, I think I'm safe.  Oh, now you're banking on a punctuation.  Yes.  You're banking all of our livelihoods on a punctuation mark.  I think a period would get us fired.  Uh-huh.  A question mark saves us. 
[00:41:00]  What about exclamation point?  Totally fired.  Exclamation point question mark.  Hmm.  Hmm.  You're putting it out there as...  Hey, this happened.  Uh-huh.  So, this happened?  Uh-huh.  You want me to write down what I want to say?  Instead of this happened, or this happened!  Did this happen?  Let me write down my Michael Jackson rumor that I want to start on Twitter.  All right.  Write that down.  See, I'm being responsible instead of doing it.  Let me get the giant yellow fucking fan that was made out of a ruler and construction paper 
[00:41:30]  the other day.  Look at this fucking thing.  It means slow down, and it also warns alien spacecraft of their approach.  You can wave them off.  All right.  This is what I want to start.  Uh-huh.  Do you want a question mark or a period?  Well, obviously a question mark.  Okay.  All right.  This is what I want to start.  And all I want to say is, like, I'll start on my Twitter.  You go to Twitter.  You go to my Twitter.  Oh, no.  And then you retweet it, and it's all over the world within, I would say, two hours. 
[00:42:00]  Holy shit.  What happened?  I'm obviously not going to say a word about that, but...  Oh, my God.  Fucking...  Unbelievable.  All right.  Unbelievable is right.  Ready?  Uh...  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  That's...  But it has a question mark.  It does have a question mark.  It's like a question mark.  Like, you're asking the question.  Yeah.  You kind of like it, don't you? 
[00:42:30]  I do kind of like it.  It is kind of good with a question mark.  Does the question mark save us?  I think so.  It's asking.  Really?  Yeah.  Twitter anything, Miss Thing and H, with a question mark.  Are you trying to get me fired?  No.  Not at all.  Should I do this?  No way.  No way.  I wouldn't.  No way.  No way.  No way, no how.  No how.  Michael Jackson from a few years ago had this to say. 
[00:43:00]  And this is actually the tomb you're talking about.  Yes.  The tomb that you bought.  Ah, this must be...  Isn't it gorgeous?  Let's have a look.  Let's go in and have a look.  Is this it?  That's it.  Wow.  Isn't it gorgeous?  Look at the face.  Come on.  It's beautiful.  This is the actual coffin.  Yeah.  A replica of the...  Sarcophagus.  Anthropod coffin of Tutankhamun.  Yeah.  In like a...  So you've...  This one's gold.  And you bought it.  Yeah.  Why have you bought it?  Because I love it.  Look at the art.  It's phenomenal.  It's a work of art.  What about... 
[00:43:30]  Would you like to be buried in something like this?  No.  I don't...  I wouldn't...  I don't ever want to be buried.  Really?  No.  What would you like to happen to me?  I would like to live forever.  Well.  Oh, well.  I guess your music will live forever.  That didn't work out, did it?  There you go.  Him talking about a tomb that he wanted to buy.  I don't know if he ever officially bought that thing.  Purchased his tomb.  All right.  We'll continue.  We go backstage with O&A. 
[00:44:00]  Bobo is gay.  Question mark.  Question mark.  That'll save you.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  What do we got?  Oh, I remember Michelle.  Michelle's going to be calling the show in about an hour.  She's a handwriting...  Oh, right.  Analyst.  Yeah, I remember that.  You might be saying to yourself,  what the fuck, guys, but...  We had a good time with her last time she called. 
[00:44:30]  We certainly did.  And she's got Michael Jackson handwriting samples.  That's...  She's going to tell us a thing or two about Michael.  Not a thing or two.  That's what we want to know.  By looking at his handwriting.  Yeah, we already told you Carl Malden died.  Dead.  He's dead.  He's dead.  But he was an old codger.  Yeah.  96 or something.  Lindsay Lohan's only 23.  Wow, does she look beat up already. 
[00:45:00]  Is she?  She's only 23?  23 today.  She peaked at like 18.  No kidding.  When she had her 18th birthday.  She is skanky.  Yeah, she's gone through too many weight changes.  Fucked her elasticity up.  Really dead.  Yeah, you gotta be careful with that.  Yeah.  You can't stretch and unstretch that shit too much.  We're distracted. 
[00:45:30]  We get tomorrow off.  Yeah, what the fuck?  We're like kids in school.  And I were discussing this during the break that we have to trick ourselves.  Because we always suck the day before we get a long weekend or the day before vacation.  And the week after.  We're so distracted.  Yeah.  We're just kind of watching the clock right now.  Don't worry.  I mean, in the end you go, wow, another fine show by you guys.  We don't mean suck like that. 
[00:46:00]  We mean our work ethic sucks.  But we're distracted.  So we want to trick ourselves from now on.  And like all of a sudden, you know, say we're taking Friday off.  But then surprise ourselves and go, well, let's take Thursday off too.  Knowing that Wednesday would be a stellar show.  So then Wednesday will suck.  No, but that's how we have to trick ourselves.  It has to be a last minute thing or something.  Listen, it's been like this for years with us.  Yeah.  The day before, like a long weekend or a vacation, we're just like, oh, we just want to go. 
[00:46:30]  We just want to go recharge the old batteries.  Yeah.  What are you doing for the fourth?  Anything?  I have no official plans.  But that's nice, right?  I think, though, my family wants to invade.  The compound?  Yeah, the Kumia compound.  For the weekend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think the invasion's on.  As in like sleepovers and stuff?  Well, whatever.  You know, I want to come over.  The weekend's supposed to be nice enough for the pool and things like that.  The other day, I come home. 
[00:47:00]  I'm shot, usually, you know.  So I sit down on the patio chairs out back by the table.  You fell asleep again?  And I fell asleep pretty much hunched over in the chair with my head on the outdoor table on top of my shirt that I had taken off because it was a nice day.  And I'm laying like that, and every so often I'm waking up and I'm looking, and I just see Keith and his family in my pool. 
[00:47:30]  And they put things in there, like the little seats with the drink holders and like the little mat that you float around on.  And I'm like twisted in a pretzel asleep, just looking going, holy shit, I'm fucking exhausted.  And just tearing it up, having fun.  Just taking control of the backyard.  Yeah, having a little fun in the old pool.  Sleeping that way is so comfortable.  I don't know why we don't sleep like that.  Sitting up like the elephant, man.  That's how I was sleeping.  But sitting up and then putting your big-headed retard. 
[00:48:00]  Putting your head in your arms like that is so freaking comfortable.  That's how I sleep on planes.  That's exactly what I was doing.  Or on trains.  I woke up and I was just like, Jesus Christ.  Then I think I went inside to the couch, sat down, and fell asleep there.  I just walk around my house and falls.  I'm like a narcoleptic.  I sleep so much.  I'm convinced that's why I've been putting some pounds on it, because I just don't burn it.  Like my metabolism is just sleeping.  It's slow half the day.  Dude, I got home yesterday. 
[00:48:30]  It was like 3 o'clock.  I made it an hour until 4.  And then I slept until this morning.  Really?  12 hours of sleep.  Awesome.  See, that is great when you can do that.  I was going to take a long nap yesterday.  I go downstairs, and I'm screwing around with some stuff down in the compound studios.  And I wake up.  I just, all of a sudden, I'm waking up.  And I'm just in, I'm laying on my keyboard. 
[00:49:00]  I was doing shit.  And I just, bam, nodded out.  And then I got a phone call that my finance guy, my and Opie's finance guy, is coming over.  Because I forgot I had made an appointment to have him come over and go over, you know, some financial stuff.  I haven't seen him in a while.  I actually haven't seen him since the house was completely empty.  I had a beanbag chair and an Xbox and a big screen TV in what is now the dining room. 
[00:49:30]  And an ugly yard.  Yeah.  An ugly, muddy yard.  It was just mud in my yard.  Now it's like a palace.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, now it's, you know.  And he was always goofing on me for the fact that I didn't have anything.  I had one couch in that room to the left of the doorway where he would come in, we would sit there, and he would go over the finances.  Right.  So what was his opening line?  I think we brought him to the show a few times.  This guy is a ghoul.  He does right by us, but he loves to talk about what could happen. 
[00:50:00]  He loves talking about morbid things.  His opening line is about some horrific thing that is happening in his life.  I'm not a fan of the morbid talk.  And then he segs into what could possibly happen to you and me.  I mean, I understand financial planning and the need to have a sound financial plan in case, you know, the unwanted happens, that you leave this mortal coil, as they call it.  That happens to everyone eventually.  Yeah.  But before we get the update, like, I saw him, you know, recently. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, he sits down with me and my girl, who is, you know, my wife, and then describes a horrific car crash scenario.  Ah.  Yeah.  And hence why I need to take care of certain things.  And my girl is sitting there horrified.  Not only because she doesn't want to hear about how I could possibly die.  Right.  But she also knows that's how my dad died. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  You don't want to hear that.  I'm like, thanks, ghoul.  You don't want to hear it.  How about you keep it vague?  Yeah.  Yeah, I get it.  You need a will, and you need this, and you need that, and life insurance.  I get it.  You don't have to go into, you know, detailed scenarios.  Yeah.  In front of the girl.  I know.  It's ghoulish.  Did he give you one of those yesterday?  Well, let's see.  He sat down.  I believe he opened up with a digestive problem and an appendectomy.  That's a good opener.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a good opener. 
[00:51:30]  It was strong.  He opened strong.  And I believe he closed with either a stroke or a brain tumor.  I'm not sure what the actual closer was.  Hey, that's a good encore.  Oh, it was killer.  I'd go to that concert every time.  Literally killer the whole way.  Right.  So I give him the tour of the house because, like I said, he hadn't been there since it  was completely empty.  And I had been there a long time with that house fucking completely empty. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  So he was very impressed and everything.  He's walking around and, oh, this is great.  This is so nice.  I like what you did here.  This.  And I'm explaining that Keith's wife, Ange, really took care of things.  And then he takes that happy moment where I am looking around going, you know, yeah, this  is nice.  That's a nice accomplishment to be able to do these things.  So, when you die, do you know where this is going?  The government can take the whole thing. 
[00:52:30]  You have to do that.  Let's paint a scenario.  You get pancreatic cancer.  Not much time.  That's a killer, you know.  You don't survive that one.  You then have to make sure that your estate is well taken care of.  Boo!  What?  What did you just turn into?  He knocks on the door.  I have to open it up.  Can you please invite me in? 
[00:53:00]  I cannot just step over the threshold.  Boo!  Boo!  What would happen if you had an embolism?  I don't want to think like this.  But you have to think about things like this.  But it could happen.  And if your estate is not planned out, the government will take it like I take your blood.  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:53:30]  Ah!  Ah!  I feel like I'm watching Keith Olbermann with this dumb music.  It's fuck you, Keith Olbermann.  I hate you.  It's ghoulishly horrible.  And does that government angle work with you?  I'm like, so?  Then the government takes.  Where am I?  I don't want them taking my shit.  You know something, though?  I don't care.  I don't want them taking my shit.  So, um...  Masferatu.  So, I figure, you know, you write up something. 
[00:54:00]  Eh, you get that out of the way.  Any insurance policies I have, change the beneficiaries to people that I give a flying fuck about.  Instead of, you know...  I should have taken care of that, I think.  Maybe a while ago.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  But then, you know, I like when he talks about the market, the government, and what they're  doing as far as certain tax laws go and stuff like that. 
[00:54:30]  Like, that's why he's there.  he's a smart guy yeah he knows his shit about just about finances so when he starts talking  about that i'm like oh cool all right we're off on this and then you know oh yeah because this  and this and the government this and this he goes well let me let me tell you what happened to a  friend of mine that i knew many years ago i'm like here it comes i was like now it's a segue  into fucking what what happened is fucking his asshole fell out and i don't know i was like 
[00:55:00]  it's just goofy oh god he's he's he's he's so morbid and i blow him off time and time again  and finally i can't blow him off anymore yeah it's uh yeah because you reach a point where it's  i finally have to take it he's got to come over we got it like yeah right i got to update some some  of this financial shit and but you know it's just going to be hours of ghoulishness you think he  likes death he loves it he loves it he loves it he loves it and the more grotesque and odd 
[00:55:30]  the demise the better yeah i'm trying i'm trying not to get too personal with the guy because  the stories he's told me i'm like holy shit yeah well i think we covered it but there's a few other  stories in there just horrific things that happen i know i know people he knows that's what it is  that's why i don't want to get personal either but it's just like trying to keep it vague damn it's 
[00:56:00]  but he always has tragedy he always has something going on tragic story going on it's like all right  you know i need a little more uh money taken out of cash and put into some equities i guess  could you all right help me out here moving on remember we try to do a bit called best man  speeches wow you know something for years we were trying to do that uh bad best man speeches yeah  we thought this would be a great radio bit and we never were able to accomplish it we we tried we

[01:07:00]  off what for number four for number four which is snickers what's their latest campaign well they  just come up slightly change the name of it that's why i don't like them well they they've took it  upon themselves to just start making up ridiculous words and then putting that on the actual rappers  of the snickers instead of the name snickers yeah uh sam just mentioned uh patrick chewing  chewing chewing sounds like chewing though i don't i know it's because it's a play on on the player 
[01:07:30]  yes on the best at least they're using a fucking topical guys at least it goes with my last joke  here wait here here here here's some uh here's some billboards a hungerectomy yeah and it's in  the snickers logo i don't a hungerectomy is kind of like when they go into the snickers bar  and remove its reproductive organs you just get a hollowed out cranky bar here's a substantialicious 
[01:08:00]  that's just stupid it sucks who came up with that ad campaign and it's everywhere it's on tv  it's on billboards that's a stupid ad campaign that like samantha would help darren with i have to pass  by this every day on my way here get dunked on by patrick chewing patrick chewing is not dunking  on anyone these days he's the asian version he's got he's got old man eyes now if you 
[01:08:30]  he looks exactly the same except for the old man eyes you're thinking of patrick ewing  yeah but patrick chewing is a twix as a snickers bar he's a sensation in the candy bar world  peanutopolis what does that mean look it up it says so many it's a lot of peanuts  yeah oh i love this one this one must be all over brooklyn hey yeah no get about it no get about it  because of the nougat that's fucking horrendous we should rule the world i'll never eat it would 
[01:09:00]  be so easy to rule the world oh oh what's this one i guess uh this one is in steve's uh part of town  this one i guess it's obviously a play on the campaign it doesn't look as professionally made  before we uh hit the people up with this one remember when we said a few minutes ago that  this bit would turn around nice of course here's the turn right here here's where it makes a sharp  left here's the turn here's where it makes it makes sense for our show here's the prestige 
[01:09:30]  prestige yeah this one is it just says in the snickers-esque uh logo and font it just says  homolicious homolicious there you go stick it up your butt oh here we go there's another one man  how many of these are there chew some yum chew some yum train under master chew some yum 
[01:10:00]  it's delicious why did they add a why there  take night classes at the chew university but it's just a candy bar you can't what no oh  sam you like that one yeah i mean because it reminds you chew makes you think oh i am kind of hungry  and the branding of the snickers logo is still there so it does bring the snickers to mind and make  you kind of want to go to the store well look at that one with the newspaper shoes run the media 
[01:10:30]  there's no reason for that  unbelievable slay dragons with sir snacks a lot that was just funny is it yeah sir snacks a lot  it's a plan for munaki uh you know guys well i figured you need a little help today  down the hallway all right well ah hey gomez why is he here i mean it's good and all i love when

[01:24:00]  yes and she loves him with all four of her hooves  through all the tough times they've always found a way to reconcile and become stronger  she'd go out and sleep with a black man and he'd forgive her  he's a cuckold he got brought up on rape charges and she drove him to the police station and supported  him he shit his pants she threw him out 
[01:24:30]  that's the end of it no or they've always found a way to reconcile and become stronger  that's stronger their love is as certain as the destruction of uncle frank's liver  oh that oh  oh shit no you didn't  frank's liver stop it and he points at uncle frank and he goes now everybody knows you don't drink you  you just got liver cancer which is very rare  oh  it just bums the whole wedding out

[01:29:00]  around like his um message board uh icon his head goes back and forth  also we have bobo here to try to introduce us to a new bit new bit he knows that the uh bruce  springsteen wall wall wall bit is officially dead yes uh he pretty much just destroyed it and killed 
[01:29:30]  it uh and now uh we'll see what he comes up with and uh the big get after the break no one's gonna go  anywhere finally anthony has brought in some sample audio of his live from the compound show yes see  i'm helping the program this is why anthony should be allowed to continue with live from the compound  because it brings material to our show you know what we're like opie we're like radio's version of 
[01:30:00]  policemen we are constantly on duty i like it like we're constantly on duty uh looking for the next thing  like that and and uh it doesn't matter what time of day or night yeah if we find it  it's our job to uh use it don't penalize us for doing more work or work you got the big show that  that does way less work we more work get on his case for less work and leave us alone for doing  more work a whole snow cone pay me that's worth consulting right there how much should i charge 
[01:30:30]  it 200 200 for that right there 200 and it's the most basic stuff and you round it up every 15 minutes  is 200 right so even for a second it's 200 i'm gonna be rich if it's 16 minutes it's 400 it's it's  very very logical yeah leave us alone for doing more work yeah bother the other guy for doing less  work exactly pay me pay me pay me so some samples of life in the compound next i heard uh it's uh 
[01:31:00]  life in the compound versus the mega pain show uh yeah mega pain show um i can't wait to hear that i'm  just kind of teasing it i can't wait yeah i'll set up how it was done and uh what it looked like  and then we can listen listen along now a lot of reaction to the interns doing about an hour on our  show yesterday yelling screaming and competing and uh uh simple mike was uh crowned executive intern  yesterday and i gotta tell you um i know a bunch of people tweeted me and said they hated it but a lot 
[01:31:30]  more people tweeted and said they loved it and that's just the nature of the beast if you didn't like  it i don't know what to tell you i'm sorry we try to do our best here on a daily basis we try but  more people truly did like it in my little dumb world uh with that said uh sam went backstage to  get the reactions of the interns on uh the new executive intern simple mike okay we go to break with  this and now backstage with ona here is primetime sam roberts i'm primetime sam roberts and the opian 
[01:32:00]  anthony show held a best audio contest to crown the show's new executive intern intern simple mike  won the contest leaving other interns like angry matt a bit perturbed hey matt are you glad that uh  intern mike is your new executive intern who intern mike he's your new immediate superior  i i don't know who that is mike yeah that's it there he is right there red t-shirt i see dennis and 
[01:32:30]  i see the wall do you plan on obeying mike's orders i have no i don't know who mike is next we found  intern evan who felt like he was robbed evan what went wrong in there today almost everything people's  perspective of uh leadership amongst the interns is heavily skewed well the perspective is that  intern mike is the executive intern and that's because he was appointed such 
[01:33:00]  yeah i i don't agree with that at all and i think it's detrimental to the entire opening anthony show  are you planning on uh listening to mike as your superior just for the good of the team absolutely  not because it's not for the good of the team listening to him would be not listening to reason  did you think about that before you said it yeah it didn't sound better in your head no it didn't  and it sounded just as bad coming out finally we caught up with simple mike the new king of the 
[01:33:30]  interns to talk about his newly won title hey intern mike congratulations on your victory today  thanks em are you excited about your new responsibilities as executive intern i'm  excited to see how the team starts operating as a whole and hopefully we'll get you know some uh  some better teamwork down the line and just keep the show going because they seem very pissed off at  you well i wasn't in charge of the competition so what are you going to do you're the executive  intern what are you going to do i mean you're asking questions i don't i don't have or want to give 
[01:34:00]  the answers to so you don't have the answers i or want to give them but you don't have them i might  is one of your strategies as a leader to stay as diplomatic as possible um uh no comment is there  any time that like you see a mic in front of your face and think oh maybe i should be entertaining no  no no no no just try and stay pc he may be bad on the air but at least he knows a lot of meaningless  and condescending jargon something tells me this kid has executive material written all over him 
[01:34:30]  i'm prime time sam roberts and this has been backstage with ona  oh boy  it's always something around here isn't it what's going on it's hard to do a show when  this is going on so we should bring it to the table what's going on steve i have we just had a  fun time with liquid liquidist and now we have to deal with uh some a major issue actually 
[01:35:00]  uh apparently there may be an issue with uh those pre-recorded promos for jim's uh comedy gigs my gigs  they're saying equal advertising so i can't run my pre-recorded gigs you've heard them before  here on this uh well channel where jimmy is uh recorded there's musical background they're very  funny it's like uh you know see me in pookepsy or something like that uh and they're saying now that 
[01:35:30]  those can't run because why the reason i have heard in the past now this has not been related this  has not been related to me specifically is that uh those gigs when they're pre-recorded uh equal  you know are the equivalent of an of a recorded spot and what's the problem if it's the equivalent  of anything um why isn't the comedy club paying for it well here's the deal it's not as much for the 
[01:36:00]  comedy club as it is for me all right hold on let me let me get the show let me jump in i got  to give the history of this whole thing okay this was a deal we made many many years ago with jimmy  and our uh comedy friends simple as this we have a lot of great comedians that come in on this uh  show and really help out the program i don't have to tell anyone that and the deal we made it started  with jimmy and the rest of the guys was look we can't really pay you for your time but you know we'll  give you some nice exposure for your gigs which means they get a few more people in the seats and 
[01:36:30]  a lot of these guys have door deals and whatnot and they make more money if more people are coming  to see their shows okay and as far as jimmy goes more importantly jimmy doesn't make anywhere as near  the amount of money he should be making for his participation in the opian anthony show and the deal we  made with him a very long time ago uh at xm when we came to satellite radio i was like look jimmy we  could we could give you this but what we can do to make up uh the difference is make sure that we uh 
[01:37:00]  promote everything you do so you make more money when you're when you're doing all your side stuff  not side stuff because it's it's his career okay uh fast forward that went on for years everyone was  happy with the arrangement we made the comedians are like that yeah it's worth it to me jimmy of course  making nice money on the side which made it worth it to him to continue doing the show uh the last i  heard they got rid of uh the promos of all our comedian friends and i'm like this that's that  doesn't make sense that's not cool these guys are coming in and doing us a favor more than we're 
[01:37:30]  doing them a favor unbelievable so we lost that argument and now out of nowhere we're finding out  that not only is are we not uh playing those promos we're we're not playing jimmy's anymore that's  that's this company i don't i don't know what they're doing that's not why are you doing this  yeah why what why are you fucking me with this where's the upside we all know what's going on  behind the scenes why is this happening yeah all right then you got to pay jimmy about five times 
[01:38:00]  uh the amount of money why is this happening the guy uh  it's like i get the message they want me to leave the show i got it i know what's going on i understand  what's going on i don't know what their uh yeah i'll say that too i i don't know what they're  thinking i i really don't because i try to avoid them at all costs because uh so far i don't really 
[01:38:30]  understand their uh their logic or strategy this makes no radio thing don't they don't they know  that jimmy going out and doing gigs like gets people to listen to this show like they see jimmy and  might not know opian anthony from a hole in the wall sure but then they know jimmy norton and they  go oh yeah that guy's funny i think there's an intellectual side of it that they completely  get and then there's the business side of it that they complete that is no that's business  well no they gotta look past that because the you know i agree with you i'm at every turn i mean if 
[01:39:00]  they want to look at the business part of the whole thing then jimmy is is drastically underpaid  then this was a way of making up the money right so if they want to do this then if if they're  looking at this from a business standpoint from a company standpoint then they got to make a brand  new deal with jimmy and pay him a hell of a lot more money than he's making they're not going to  do that i i understand they're not going to pay anymore they're not going to run my promos this was  a way of you know making up the difference because we all know jimmy you know was underpaid at 
[01:39:30]  every time it's it's it's it's i've i've never had this in my i'm doing comedy 20 years and i've  never had this kind of an experience yeah in my career never being loyal means nothing man no no  there's i mean it means nothing that's gone just gone in the in this in this business it seems like  they try and fix things that aren't broke a lot good one good one pat i i okay 
[01:40:00]  i would agree with you if it wasn't for the fact that they just like try to fuck us at every turn i  know i know what i mean it's like it's like this is just another thing in a long list of things that  make no sense yet they feel for some reason they have to continuously poke us i got gigs i got gigs in 
[01:40:30]  atlanta coming up and uh somewhere else uh chicago maybe middletown new york whatever it's  it's fucking it's mind-boggling plus it was way to get the plugs out there so we don't take away  from you know the the general show so now all right so now what we're going to do because you know  jimmy's our guy now we're going to spend a lot of time in show making sure people know where he's  going to be playing yeah fuck it we'll do it live are you kidding pretty much what we just said  it's it's it's it's beyond infuriating and we all know what else is going on i'm not going to get 
[01:41:00]  into it but it's like why are you doing this why are you doing this  i'm speechless man i'm really being loyal means it means nothing yeah 
[01:41:30]  unbelievable mention them all you want during the live show jim  anybody shut up is any uh for real shut up is anybody here that's not that's not going to solve  i know it's not going to solve it i know you're gonna do it it's not for what it's thank you  i'm making this really hard i have i can honestly tell you the table every day and we're holding up 
[01:42:00]  our end of the bargain trust me more than holding up our end and they just make it hard at every  fucking turn every fucking turn it's the worst experience i've ever had yeah and i'm a really  easy guy to work with i mean maybe i'm a pain in the ass sometimes i'm here every fucking day unless  i'm out doing a gig well yeah i fucking plug the company it's like it's do you think leno like he  likes opian anthony very much but let's be honest he was happy to plug them at xm but he's not too 
[01:42:30]  crazy about certain elements maybe here exactly they have a a war going on jimmy has proven he's  a soldier he it means nothing though man i know you he gets a lot of national exposure a lot and you  know he makes sure that he mentions opian anthony sirius xm he's doing why don't you pay him for for  all these unbelievable plugs it's amazing it's great advertising for our show and the company  and then they turn around and do this to him it's like you just want to keep playing hardball until i 
[01:43:00]  walk why don't you just say that and the other thing that's happening with jimmy that we can't  even bring up on the show is a doozy it's amazing it's it's amazing what is happening and  we're none of us are allowed to talk about it no don't even get into that yeah i know  but that one's amazing that's that's it's i am speechless  i i did not know jimmy i knew they were doing it with the other guys  and i i argue that it doesn't even matter if they're here what are they going to say  it's giving me more garbage and more hey it's you know the i don't even know what it's going to be 
[01:43:30]  i can't even say i don't even know well something's got to be said is it is anyone down the hall i've  never felt so completely unprotected and i don't what do i do wrong i mean i don't  fuck up i don't fuck the company i'm loyal i'm it's like i plug you what do you want  what do you want man yeah why would they do this  and they do it in such a way like they assume it's like no big deal we're finding about it 
[01:44:00]  finding out about it right now i just found actually i walked in the dark i'm going away  uh and so i'm like yeah i'm doing this and i'm such a dumb fucking motherfucker man  i really i'm a dumb motherfucker i'm a dummy  just a dummy  oh oh i hope they're i hope they're real happy every day they don't give a shit thanks for 
[01:44:30]  derailing every day it's something every day it's just one thing why why stop making this so  fucking hard it's easy this is so easy to come in here do our show just to but but there's just  fucking a ton of people in suits that are no it's not a ton of people it's one or two well yeah 
[01:45:00]  but there's a bunch of people trying to protect their jobs so they have to come up with shit  and what what so why do that why do that  it constitutes a commercial and so so what it's for me so technically yeah why are you why are you  trying to fuck me at every turn i don't play the victim either not at all no why are you doing that 
[01:45:30]  loyalty means nothing man it means nothing like a fucking jerk off  i'm running around marrying myself like oh am i so fucking stupid yeah you know yeah  you go on uh shows always mention jimmy's jimmy's promoted the company the company in this show way  more than aunt and i have because jimmy you know has it gets to do all these national shows 
[01:46:00]  and he's right in there making sure he gets promoted the platform on seven lenos  seven it's a fucking it's disgusting you know what and it's embarrassing you know what seven uh  leno commercials would cost this company exactly why don't you use logic before you just casually  make these dumb decisions one-sided seven commercials on leno would be you you you can't  even afford it so you turn around and then take his uh his stupid comedy promos away from him it's  it's not even the promos it's the whole thing it's like why why are you just why don't you just say 
[01:46:30]  you want me to leave and not try to fucking force me out like why are you doing that  it mm-hmm i don't know their intentions every time you say that i gotta say that i you know i don't  know what i don't know how these guys think i'm baffled by these guys baffled  they promise things to our face and then all of a sudden because of something that happens they  all of a sudden the promises go away and their answer to that is well what do you want me to tell  you well i want you to do what you said you're going to do that's all 
[01:47:00]  it's just too infuriating because it's it just it doesn't end being loyal means nothing there's  just it's one thing after another means nothing whether it's a bit we want to do that gets turned  down something like that or something like this and everything else in between it's a constant 
[01:47:30]  screw job for no reason just because we were on the shitty end of the merger stick  well the other guy takes half a year off merger oh my god but i'm such a dumb  motherfucker oh it's gonna be good we'll merge it'll be i i'm i should be shot oh just thinking  about i'm saying it yeah saying it yeah we're excited i think i'm such a fucking dummy jimmy was 
[01:48:00]  way more excited about the merger than it and i were god almighty my fucking stupid it was just an  awful fucking uh thing that we you know worse than i ever thought it was gonna be to tell you the truth  how do you deal with people that just like fuck you at every turn it's i i don't know what to say  it's mind-boggling 
[01:48:30]  this is it's it's it's i'm speechless about i really keep saying that i apologize  i'm sorry pat i mean it's all right who made it i want to know i would love to know who the one  person we all know who heard the commercial made the decision we know who heard the we know who made the  decision we all know who made the decision there's only one person that person's gotta be spoken to  yeah and it wasn't malice people are gonna say malice no that person's gotta be spoken to then  yeah it doesn't matter never had a good conversation with a guy it's a tough conversation every time so 
[01:49:00]  good luck to you it's always what can i get it's not not one moment do you feel like you're doing your  job you're here every day  jimmy go down and talk to him for real it's it's mind-boggling go down and talk to him  am i am i i'm not going crazy and saying stupid no no you're going crazy thinking you're going  crazy go down and talk to him yeah and we certainly will go in there and say you know we'll have the  same conversation with the guy it only seems like it could only be a misunderstanding because 
[01:49:30]  anybody who hears jimmy on the show doesn't want him to leave not a misunderstanding that's  ridiculous believe me it's no misunderstanding there are no misunderstandings here everyone  understands uh that uh we are the the bastard children of a defunct company uh xm when they got  when they got steamrolled because of incompetent fucking xm management they got steamrolled by uh 
[01:50:00]  serious and um everyone on the xm side of the the merger just got giant dicks up their ass maybe  you're still an asset well we're assets all right or ass liquid assets liquid ass at why don't we take  a break yeah let's uh let's do that we'll see what happens i don't know if we could get the show back  on track today to be honest with you but that is a biggie we'll try because this is a this is a uh 
[01:50:30]  a game changer god damn we got a game changer in our midst they are like i just don't get it  no it's just look let me let me just run the company for real yeah because i mean anyone could do this  for real i could run this company i could i could run programming easily so easily i'll i'll i'll  leave the microphone and i'll i'll go behind the scenes and i'll and i'll i'll fucking produce

[01:51:30]  what i've seen over the years the one thing i've seen over the years over and over again is how they  just make this so complicated when it's the easiest gig in the world for everybody whether you're on the  air off the air it is easy but they just make it complicated and they layer layer everything with  all sorts of layers of uh management and it's they overthink everything and i've seen it it's  unbelievable i've seen the radio everything alone you hire creative people let them be creative let 
[01:52:00]  them do what they're doing because they really do know best when we're doing all these side things trust  me we know what we're doing if it works we know we leave it alone if it doesn't then do something  but if things are working just leave it leave it the fuck alone leave it the fuck alone alone  oh my god we'll take a uh a break and uh and uh and see what happens next opian anthony  you're checking out the opian anthony show hi uh a little update jim norton's down the hall talking to

[01:53:00]  looks like yes right who's he he's walking steve why is he jimmy and steve steve i don't know  that's what it looks like yeah that's a long hallway though we could be oh i know that hallway  is fucking ridiculous he's ridiculous uh well anyway you brought some audio from uh 
[01:53:30]  live in the compound yeah very funny audio actually yeah last night uh having a little  fun um had a bunch of people uh in the room should we wait for jimmy and uh he's not he's only 50 yards  away now yeah walking down the 50 yard line because i don't want to interrupt you no it's okay all  right that's jimmy he makes his way into the uh thing he's chewing gum or someone's tongue yeah  and and well um a bladder's a reasonable guy i mean i'm not kissing his ass but he's a reasonable 
[01:54:00]  dude it's humongous is a reasonable fella um so a few minutes and one blowjob later uh i'm going to  cut a promo it was it was a kind of a it was a bit of a misunderstanding um so uh they saw it your  way jimmy it wasn't it was like it wasn't a hundred percent but he was he was like yeah we just want to  figure out a way to do it where it's right and it's like but he wasn't being a dick and i know he was 
[01:54:30]  being truthful it's like you know it's like you can kind of talk to somebody no and with other stuff  he's he's just a reasonable dude so i appreciate that all right cool um but they they have to understand  the history of this and where this comes from yeah like this was the deal we made a long time ago because  wade you know jimmy should be paid a lot more without getting into the finances of the damn  radio show but it's you know so this was some compensation yes extra compensation yes to make  it worthwhile for jimmy and and and you know in a way where the company could make sense of the whole 
[01:55:00]  thing too exactly and everyone was happy with the arrangement we made by the way almost five years  ago yeah and it's like you start to feel just with other things you start to feel silly after a while  like what am i am i really am i a sucker like am i a 40 year old guy who's just yeah what am i a sap  am i that dumb yeah you know so that's what you start to feel like there's still other stuff that i'd  like to resolve but i do appreciate steve on that one so uh we're gonna figure something out yeah yeah  yeah i mean i'll cut the other one and and run it and uh i i and i will say this too sometimes there's 
[01:55:30]  probably got to be a better way to run them because you know i don't know how often they run like but  you don't want it to be every 10 minutes and i i get that too because i've heard them sometimes  oh this is a little a long one you know and again i'm not an unreasonable ass either who says  it should be all norton all the time you know i'm pretty even keeled with that stuff well you  kind of push that on us a lot though no i know that but it's more because i understand that my voice  is so pleasurable i just bring a smile really don't that was really sad there man fuck no 
[01:56:00]  shit wow it's like i just want to i want to be happy to be here i want to enjoy it i really do  man yeah i love doing fucking radio i love doing this show you know we uh we have a reputation for  bitching absolutely but we are bitching but we don't oh you meant the other way he has the g at the  end you have an i am that's different but it's time for uh management to turn this thing around  for real like we are holding up our end of the bargain there's something called good faith that 
[01:56:30]  this company for some reason doesn't understand xm totally understood that they would just do  things in what was called good faith like you know uh we're we're all in this together and maybe we  can't do this for you but we'll do this and it was done in good faith it wasn't part of a contract  or part of a spreadsheet or part of anything it was just it was called good faith yeah and and these  guys got to understand this stuff we we're the easiest guys to actually uh have as employees 
[01:57:00]  of believe it or not just leave us alone and know that we're really smart at what we do we really are  and we yell and scream when we get frustrated because we we we don't understand why they don't  see the obvious all this comes down as the obvious yeah just let us do the show and we'll shut our  fucking mouths we're real yeah because we're sick of bitching i'll be the biggest i've already been a  serious xm whore i'll be glad to do it everywhere i go yeah it's like i like i like that in the 
[01:57:30]  introduction i love being associated with the show i like satellite radio i fucking hate terrestrial  right right for real right not that anybody gives a shit but we went back to terrestrial it was a  money hit much more for you guys than me but it was a hit for me too much more for you and but on a  creative level i was thrilled right that not even to knock krock i was thrilled creatively at least that  that went away i just look at it logically what you get from from jim norton from just a marketing 
[01:58:00]  standpoint you can't you can't pay him for the marketing he's given you it would cost you a bloody  fortune to get mentions on you know jay leno and not jay leno anymore obviously but jimmy will  certainly be doing conan o'brien and letterman and all these uh national shows hopefully leno too it  starts at 10 o'clock oh yeah exactly in september when leno comes back and there's jimmy front and  center opian anthony sirius xm you would pay a fortune for that so just leave him alone leave us alone 
[01:58:30]  just look at it logically that's all you're right good use good faith it's like we're doing the right  thing i i love being here anthony and i have been at this for 15 fucking years and the one thing i  can tell you with all the companies we've worked for that there was always something called good faith  yeah that just worked it transcends for some reason that legal documents and things like that it's just  it's it's a handshake thing it's a it's a all right right that sounds cool let's see if that works 
[01:59:00]  kind of a thing yeah but but now it's all about you know just whatever's in writing if it's not in  writing it never happens right uh there's there's this whole thing of just just fucking no human  contact right it's all done with with uh other people and delegating to this one and that one and  in fairness they did a little good faith recently with like our side projects because they were having a  a major issue with uh uh both of our side projects not just anthony's yeah you know you know what we 
[01:59:30]  could tweet and what we could film and what we could do this and that and we we basically sat him down  and said look this is a gray area trust me we've been we've been doing extra extra credit our entire  careers and it just works and gives us a better grade in the end with the listeners and the fans and  and the subscribers you know we're bringing more people to the platform because of some of the extra  shit we're doing this is and you can't maybe you can't pull out a pie chart but i'm telling you  what we're doing doing this long enough to know yes this works in the end and what jimmy does also 
[02:00:00]  when he when he does gigs and and does these tv uh appearances and stuff it's it's telling people  where they could find us on a daily basis if they enjoy us it's a it's a it's a commercial that they  don't have to pay for what's a 30 second spot uh go for on like jay lanter for real gotta be 20 30 bucks  that's not worth funny if that was right but perhaps exactly right but if you sat down with 
[02:00:30]  management instead of the yeah and and actually just had a conversation go look this is what a  spot on jay leno would cost yeah so why not continue to have this for free and all you have to do is  give up a a few fucking promo mentions for comedy clubs in the middle of nowhere for jim norton  yeah so he gets fannies in the seats and guess what some of those fannies that go into that comedy  club turned on to satellite radio the opian anthony show and things that i'm doing and that you're  doing uh it's the same thing it's a commercial for our show for our our morning show here right 
[02:01:00]  this is seen as a home base this this is the place right yeah everything else like revolves around  this so if we're doing other things it's to bring people here that's the that's the bottom line  and and a lot of times we you know we're taking our own time uh without compensation and and doing  that but they got to see everything as this threat this thing this this horrible thing that we're doing 
[02:01:30]  that isn't uh supposed to be done i mean why because everyone else isn't doing it we're innovators  we really are and i gotta call bob too because i i think the thing bob with certain things i have  to i mean i don't shit i'm i don't mother fuck bob but there's certain things with bob i'm like you  know what man you we really have to take the spurs to him every so long for real because i i'm gonna  make a move that i can't i cannot have that anymore no yeah i feel like i think bob's a great agent but 
[02:02:00]  there's certain things that bob you got to handle certain things appropriately uh-huh i don't disagree with  you at all on that one god my the managers i have in comedy are fucking ruthless yeah they  don't put up with shit dude give them the crop we don't put up with shit anymore we don't they  don't fucking play games i watch the way they deal with fucking with people they don't play games at  all they're but they're great right they're professional but they also uh you know make sure  uh you know what i'm gonna stop i said red paddle me for you know make it official i'm just i'm just 
[02:02:30]  saying that they i'll have this conversation with somebody instead of in front of everybody i deal  with them trust me jonathan those guys and david paddle thank you they're fantastic thank you  hey did i did i i sent you guys an email i don't know if you know my fucking you didn't send me no  fucking email sent you and anthony a private email i certainly did motherfucker i didn't get it  what time uh oh i got it i um my butt hurts tonight so no why i said lick i didn't say  fuck all righty i am sorry i snapped it pat i'm sorry about that jimmy for real that was the

[02:04:30]  jokes that was part of his charm he did you hear the what about and like whenever he would get to  the punchline i would always go i can't really hear you what'd you say and then he would start i'd  just hang up on him in mid-joke like he's like two jews walking to a ball click and then he'd call  back i got a damn phone what was it oh at the same place i'd get him every time  he was just a really sweet guy sorry to hear that no that's right he was just uh he's kind  of surprised i'm sorry i really brought this show down today i apologize the pre-holiday show  don't you worry about it geez what do you think it's july 5th bring it right back down even lower

[02:06:00]  why brilliance and creativity i certainly hope that's why pay me is that a consulting for you  yeah not really that's a come on that's a blatant self-promotion  all right you want to do some live from the compound i've been telling for and started the  life in the compound thing which uh it is terrific i i uh i take a peek every once in a while  it's a lot of i'm officially not allowed to do it because then that would be the opening at the show 
[02:06:30]  they would have a problem yeah then that'd be kind of a problem although i kind of like  made it a weird appearance on your show yes you did a very bizarre appearance but anyway um  it's from the bomb shelter in my house yeah come on one time just to hang out a little bit  i would love for you i know it's not allowed my life of course you're allowed come on in  it's anybody everyone knows knows it's gonna be the anthony and jimmy show soon anyway oh is that  what it is i know you're kidding but please don't just don't just stick around please

[02:08:30]  were doing live from the compound and uh you got into it with a show called the mega pain show yeah  at first you know at first i was just uh yapping about uh you know faggy movie trailers and things  like that and then um some guy pops a link up there so i hit it and on this same web server is somebody  doing another show and it's a woman doing a show um where she just talks about uh i don't know guys and 
[02:09:00]  girls and how men and women should relate to each other and stuff just some blob bob babbling uh a  little latina woman um and her phone number was at the bottom of the screen and i believe at the time  she had nine people in the room that's a lot for most of those shows online to tell you the truth  you're right i troll around some of those shows no joke there are nine people in the room yeah i uh  i spin around sometimes and i look at some of these shows and i go god bless you guys but why 
[02:09:30]  why are you doing this no one's watching people over in your living room yeah you could actually  get more people uh just inviting them in your living room and doing the show that way but you  know what it is the beauty of the internet because you never know when it goes viral yeah that's why  i'm excited about making videos and stuff because i'm doing it for for that one hit that i'm going  to get some some dumb video that goes viral but that's the logic of all of us you just not just me  and you everybody listening to our voices wants that viral experience to happen i don't even know whether 
[02:10:00]  it's with their twitter their videos their fucking podcast whatever well my stupid vista thing went  up to i stopped looking a while ago i think it it clicked over three million hits yeah wow it was  giant yeah that stupid fucking video went ridiculous uh all over the place all over the world there's  comments the amount of comments on it and it was because uh people you know nailed it they love windows  they hate windows yeah is it three and a half million three and a half million three and a half 
[02:10:30]  million views for this windows vista thing where i ran it through my shredder because it wouldn't  load on my computer yep and uh a fuckload of comments just because people were like hey you're a mac  fanboy go fuck yourself and then others were like windows is great yeah you got a fucking like a  really good rating too that's like a four and a quarter star rating out of five that's a phenomenal  no it really that was a uh and that was just me setting up a stupid camera and uh doing it like  i was installing my vista disc in my shredder because it wouldn't install on my computer so i 
[02:11:00]  ran through the instructions and everything and just ran it through the shredder and uh people seem  funny if all the views were just for me and opie we're so starstruck just kind of help me out make  me feel good it's a good video but it's no uh it's no back waxing video of course not you know what it  should be it's a close second though to my back waxing video yeah you have back waxed pre-shaved  anthony look at that oh it's horrible awful someone added uh pulp fiction to the oh did they put the 
[02:11:30]  which i wanted to do but i didn't have the fucking music so oh that's funny man makes the video much  better hell yeah so anyway live from the compound the mega pain show so uh clips in some guy gives me a  link i click on it um and it's this woman and she's talking about relationships and stuff and like i said  she's a latina so she's got that real kind of city thing going on and you know yeah yo i hear you  i'm feeling you i'm feeling that uh and i pop it up on my screen behind me because i could like roll 
[02:12:00]  video behind me and stuff so i pop it up on the screen and then i realized the phone number's right  there so i start noticing her room count is going up and her phone is ringing off the hook  now i'm like oh shit all of my viewers now are going over and and fucking with her right so uh  it was nothing but show references and just giving her uh quite a tough little time oh i can't wait  to hear this yes good looking so it looks great dude and that uh yeah but it's physical not really

[02:23:30]  billion 7 million 507 961 foreskins to circle the equator if we measured height using foreskins  shack would be 94 foreskins tall or 18 black ones mankind has patiently waited for the day when  science would allow us to measure time in foreskins that day has come with 69 971 foreskins per mile  and the average indycar hitting speeds of up to 214 miles per hour that equals a speed of 14 million

[02:27:30]  that that never happened no we heard it did yeah we heard that it did because we heard that  it did it that you actually did it with your brother it never happened no all right hold on  this hold on hold on because i've been handed something that is going to be  just the perfect way to end this week of radio  oh no they they shut up yeah hold on frank bobo who's this christina chick what do you mean you 
[02:28:00]  can't just say that you're going out with someone if they don't know that they're going out with you  sam you know anything about this she knows as a matter of fact is this real well i introduced the two of  them last week yeah um christina was surprised at first but eventually i think bobo's charm uh won her  over when she walked into the building this morning of course bobo was already here because  he has been here sitting out there since 6 15 yeah uh he kissed her on the cheek which she  at first again seemed somewhat surprised by but was there a bit of a recoil um there could have been 
[02:28:30]  but it was early so maybe that just had to do where is she she's probably blown away by the fact that  a guy is this romantic this early that is true unfortunately she's working right now for one of  the other channels i believe uh is this real uh yeah you kissed her he kissed her on the cheek  that it's real so now what makes you a couple it's real what makes you a couple yeah yeah that's a good  question well the fact that she said i'm getting laid by her she said that yeah how did she say it 
[02:29:00]  what words did she use i don't know how she said it but she said how did you know she said it that i  don't know how she said it with her eyes sam you remember right when they say no they really mean yes  yes apparently the hammer is the tool of love and you bludgeoned them with it from first the blood  end and then the hook end and then they enjoy being with you what are you doing with that hammer bobo

[02:34:00]  as stupid as they come he's actually writing out the words e-i-g-h-t f-i-v-e hey what was that number  and should i spell out dash or just put one you're a goddamn fool derrick and you should be  fired you are you are a bag of shit derrick  all right here's bobo trying to do a little ladies jocking all right  all right this next one this next one i'd like to dedicate to my girl christina  yes that's right i got someone's phone number so here's a phone number about a phone number 
[02:34:30]  here's a song about a phone number that you probably all thought was real but you  idiot  no no no no no no you gotta you gotta stop when the vocals he hit the post with a tractor trailer  let's try it again bobo let me try another one let's try it let's try bad  yes because that's what that was yeah bad then this is the song it's bad rhymes with glad and mad 
[02:35:00]  mothers against drug driving  here's bad because yes that's right i have been bad at times  now he can see the post with binoculars what the fuck are you doing  you want me to go longer  come on i'd listen to this all day  i looked over there and he looked at me and was just like stunned that he just stopped 
[02:35:30]  how about let's try one for that was too long how about for iran all right  it's like a seagulls yes  oh my god that's good why wouldn't you listen to this all day though for real  all right all you people with bad with bad hair here's here's one that'll really take you way back  of course this would probably take me way back to times i would run from from 
[02:36:00]  fans that are trying to find my address  yes that's right i'm talking about you you know who i'm talking about you you somehow found my  address you were knocking my door  he just stands there staring at the microphone i wasn't sure how long to go on that one well that's  the whole yeah that's the whole talent of doing that oh it's trying to fill the whole trying 
[02:36:30]  yes yes somebody just talks and then stops before well before or way after the the vocals kick in  anyone could do that you gotta lead it right up until the point and then bam hit the fucking post  one more all right let's see uh let's try uh let's try you beat it all right  all right now here's here's one dedicated to all you people who all you gangsters out out there i 
[02:37:00]  know all you people you guys you you guys probably always try to kick each other's ass i see it all  the freaking time when i growing up going when i went to hillcrest high school here's what's for  all you right now this here is beat it right now on the 80s on eight xm eight and a serious eight  right that's that's right i know that there's gonna be some bloodshed going on bring out those nines 
[02:37:30]  that's actually not bad you're only missing it by about 45 seconds all right listen uh men bobo would  have sex with yeah all right uh is this in any particular order yeah not in any particular order  but this is entirely true because the first three are numbers one two and all right the first three  are number one two and three so you would have sex with number one first out of all these guys if 
[02:38:00]  all these guys are standing there wanting to have sex with you this guy would be the first guy you  would pick if there was if i was handed an inno in in return for that all right we can get that gay sex  for an inno yeah and you're saying you're not gay yeah yeah no because it's for an inno don't be  silly of course uh so number two and then number three and then it's in no particular order order  so what do we now i can't believe this one here he was fed this come on which one i didn't which one 
[02:38:30]  intern evan was put in charge of of gathering these was he because if intern evan was trying  to make his own little funny bit probably it's not about him douchebag it's not about you douchebag  well let's go to the list all right when we get to that i'm gonna have to question you can now can  bobo read the names you give that i don't i don't have the list in front of me well you could here it  is the whole comic there's a copy of it yes it's not a tablet for these fucking non-sinites  i would have to go ahead you go right ahead i would have to stammering just stammer past 
[02:39:00]  every point i would have to start i would have to start with mario canton because it's obvious  it's obvious as a kid i remembered steampi back from number one right well only because he's probably  the funniest gay there is and i used to love steam pipe alley as a kid oh yeah you want his steam  pipe in your alley yeah and you're doing it obvious why he called that show steam pipe alley  oh you didn't do that come on bobo why okay what's next 
[02:39:30]  why do you call steam pipe valley now i i said i said it before it's obvious there was double entendre  in that title i don't get it the next one i'd go with would be carlos mencia  well now now why carlos mencia because he freaking sounds too gay when he does that  wait wait but but this is guys you want to have sex with so why would you say wait say that again 
[02:40:00]  oh it feels good to laugh  so carlos mencia's unclipped cock because he does the the the other one i'd have to say would be  intern david because i'd want him scarred for life now how would it be scarred for life if he was 
[02:40:30]  fucking you in your ass no no not if i did that if he was dead drunk him i'd want him scarred for  life would you want to fuck him or would you want to fuck him i'll give you his both in the ring give  you so what would you want to how would you want that to go no no i'll get blood all over my brain  you're used to that no no no if if i was gay i'd rape him all right if i was gay he'd be raped while he 
[02:41:00]  was drunk and i mean dead drunk wow cool as opposed to just you're hostile yeah i'm talking about  remember that halloween party how drunk david was oh yeah did you get him then no but he was sure i  heard you fucked him that night yeah i heard you actually had sex with him that night that you picked  up i heard no i did hear that you i heard there was a nice make-out session yeah at least i'm kissing  that never happened i do i do got another one on the list bob kelly uh-huh because of his little 
[02:41:30]  man crush issues yeah go ahead and then probably that convertible boy song oh you like the convertible  boy and that's kind of a gay-ish and and feminine well well he seems like he he'd be an excellent  gay person if he was gay he'd he'd do an excellent job playing the part sure as a matter of fact i  think he should play a gay guy in a movie cool i i think he would win an oscar for that playing the 
[02:42:00]  part of a game and then he could shove it up your ass during uh well well if i was gay right right  all right so marlon brando lips who else well this is a little awkward well this one i feel  awkward mentioning you you're on this list what me well because why because i'd let you no because  of your no your tranny stories they're hot right exactly i i exactly i'm amazed that someone would 
[02:42:30]  actually tolerate a tranny yeah yes what do you mean you're amazed how about higher or even  higher one i i would not even have the guts to hire a tranny the guts or the want or the balls  like like that she has would you like to if you if you if you had the opportunity if i in exchange  for an inno i would well the the old inno he really likes the and then it would come out and then go 
[02:43:00]  back you know boo the the the the other one mm-hmm akhmadinejad now he got it right what is it about uh  akhmadinejad say his whole name i don't know how to muhammad akhmadinejad no mahmood mahmood  akhmadinejad i don't know how to pronounce these you got it right these middle eastern names the  all freaking sound you know the all freaking sound the same right and as far as i know his name his 
[02:43:30]  last name sounds like something i ordered at a restaurant whoa god damn bobo and akhmadinejad  right yeah that i went to some middle eastern restaurant i said yo waiter oh my god  it's actually sounds nothing like something you are not at all you couldn't sound farther for  something you order of course go ahead but anyway why him because i because i know he hates it 
[02:44:00]  he's into really humiliating people yeah this isn't anything about like guys like uh  i thought this was going to be a list of people that you found attractive enough  that you would well i guess he does have like a like a like a a dictatorish look like the dictator  the right look for a dictator like yeah turned on by men in power apparently so okay well if i was  gay he'd be he's like has that right look for a dictate the appropriate look uh right uh let's go 
[02:44:30]  down the list now the other one the other one sam because he'd make an excellent gay person  thank you you skipped one you skipped one oh yeah i forgot a rod now why would you have sex with  a rod well it's obvious he's got nothing in his pants from all the steroids wow that a boy you got  a quip about everybody don't you and i guess stephen lynch why stephen lynch well that's because he 
[02:45:00]  sings like an angel those songs are freaking funny yeah wow a lot of people are funny you know how  funny you have to be to let someone fuck you in the ass yeah yeah that well because he did a song  called if i were gay okay yeah and i think that warrants enough that if i were gay i probably uh  go for him all right and then the other one this one would be more of a revenge fuck if i could hop into 
[02:45:30]  if i could hop into a delorean there was this girl in ninth grade named michelle she was nuts about  the backstreet boys and i obviously know that nick nick carter from the backstreet boys is gay  where did you put her body what so so so what i i posed her in a shallow grave and i put leaves  over her face to hide my guilt i didn't feel right about it it was okay sorry i just i tried no plows 
[02:46:00]  i tried asking her but we're talking and what happened she went to say yes and you didn't hear  it because you talked over her babbling no no she never even had any interest she was just way too  nuts about the backstreet boys right so and that's what if i could hop into a delorean i would try i would  bring the a present-day nick carter and just anally rape it fuck him in front of her just that would win  her over just to annoy her just so she knows that nick carter is gay there's a difference between 
[02:46:30]  annoying someone and traumatizing them for the rest of their lives as they scream bloody murder  every night of their life hold on if you want to annoy somebody you put a whoopee cushion on their  seat to brutally rape their male date goes beyond annoying tt flies and fruit flies are annoying  watching your your date be brutally emasculated and dehumanized by another man's  cock yeah that was way beyond annoying you talking over people is annoying right well i feel  everybody i've tried to ask out seem nothing but airheads well said what do you expect in the 
[02:47:00]  boy in the era where there was a lot of boy bands you get all these freaking airheady people airheady  i would have nailed him  as a matter of fact i admit my sister seems starting to remind me of those airheads i had to deal with  in high school whoa my sister's freaking too nuts about the jonas brothers it freaking annoys me having 
[02:47:30]  to hear that music blasting out from her room your sister reminds you of all the girls you wanted to  bang in high school really no no well hearing that music how old your sister 13 oh that's not right  oh jesus got a picture no i don't got a picture you want one say that's it's a joke i got i do got  i had one on my old phone it got damaged on a bus  my idiotic sister dropped the phone when she was using it got ran over by a bus even a sim card got 
[02:48:00]  damaged wow so that pretty much was it for that phone thank god your sister didn't get hit by the  bus though yeah thank god otherwise there might have been some there might have been a lot of legal  troubles there well yeah i was talking more of the mental anguish and and loss that you would feel  but all right yeah legal troubles whatever yeah that too but there'd be legal troubles on top of  of course that would make it even more painful i hear you i hear you bobo um his brother was having 
[02:48:30]  sex with him at the time yeah yeah oh yeah no no no that that that never happened i said it might  the way you hold the paper you should see he holds the paper like it's the last thing keeping him from  falling off a ledge it's all wrinkled and crumbled it's amazing he's grabbing onto it yeah a big fist i  don't really have use for it so i was just taking my anger out in the paper oh were you yeah okay that  that's how i am if i'm because because i'm angry at the gay rumors that i'm just taking it out on the 
[02:49:00]  paper there's people people are realizing that there's photos and all that stuff yeah i know there's  pictures of you there's no photos because it never happened okay all right well as a matter of fact  next time my brother's in town you're gonna fuck him no no no no he's not but no he'll tell  he'll tell you exactly what happened oh why don't you tell us what happened why don't you tell us  exactly what happened and we'll confirm it next time your brother's here but tell us now beyond hold 
[02:49:30]  on hold on hold on something happened you already admitted that so why don't you just tell us what  happened and go well well i'll tell you what happened go ahead there there there i'm just saying  that i don't remember i hardly remember anything but i'm saying there probably could have been  something that happened what was it you know come on now be a little honest well open all i can tell  you is he might have uh raped me in my sleep your brother might have raped you in your sleep 
[02:50:00]  now what gives you that idea and how heavy a sleeper are you yeah well the phone rings upstairs  i'm awake three three and a half years of the truck of ambien fell in my mouth three and a half years  all right who the heck knows what the heck happened those three years those three years but i i i was in  the same room let's say with my brother growing up and i know damn well he never raped me in my sleep 
[02:50:30]  well i was never in the same room he never even lived at the same house he's a half brother all right  so how did then what gives you the the idea that this might have happened well i know he used to  visit well people visit without raping sometimes well there's stuff that i don't remember taking  place that i'm saying that this could have happened all right so what is it that you what what kind of  clicks in your head that you think oh now i kind of know well i don't think anything happened what i do 
[02:51:00]  know yeah is that somehow one time he accidentally tripped me over well i think it was i think he  was pulling me to the wagon you see this little burn on my hand yeah that's from jerking him off real  fast no that's what that's responsible he's cut he kind of knocked me off off the wagon accidentally  and i accidentally grabbed on i grabbed onto a grill huh yeah i grabbed onto a grill and  this came with what was your name what no i grabbed onto a grill a barbecue 
[02:51:30]  i grabbed onto a barbecue yeah actually i'm not even sure i'm not Barbara who no barbecue oh oh i'm not  quite sure what this whole what's the whole point of the name suzy no my sister's name is shannon no  oh shannon all right yeah my sister's name is shannon and as a matter of fact how did you get so 
[02:52:00]  off track when we were talking about your brother raping you in your sleep and you're talking about  a boo-boo you got on your hand from a barbecue well what happened with your brother that night  when he raped you in your sleep well i don't know what happened i just know he may have uh there may have  he may have tried some gay stuff going where did he try to put his penis no if anything i think he he  went for the ass so you if anything anything his brother doesn't play games all i can tell you between 
[02:52:30]  those meaty cheeks all i can tell you all i can tell you is that when my brother is here he'll prove to  you that none of it ever happened but then what do you why are you saying it did happen we're not saying  it did i'm just saying you you you seem to have this idea that it happened well well everybody here  seems to think it happened because i think it was eroc that misheard something i was saying when i was  saying that there was a reunion going on you said a coming right no no i didn't say coming i said there 
[02:53:00]  was a reunion that i was going to see him for the first time in 23 years how much older is he  he's in his late 30s how old are you i'm 27 ah big difference he's in his late 30s yeah so so he  tried putting it in your ass he might have tried might have what stopped him that i do not know  because i don't remember anything that happened so why do you think he might have tried to put in your  ass well apparently his balls hitting his rectum stops him anything what stopped him exactly 
[02:53:30]  anything he would have broke through on the other side if he kept going i don't know the  mattress underneath me stopped since you guys do you guys think there's something that's something  that went on i'll just i figured i said you know what i'll just humor these guys and say yes something  did went on and then i thought and my brother when he's here he'll prove that it never happened how  will he prove it yeah how's he gonna prove it smell his dick and then smell your ass and see what the 
[02:54:00]  difference is comparison well if that's what it takes yeah well he'll put it in your butt and then  you'll scream out and he'll go see this is the first time he's ever taken one yeah that if that what  it takes to prove that it never happened throw those s's out exactly if that's you need to prove that  it's never happened it will i'm just letting you know lately he hasn't been making many trips to new  york because he's trying not to lose any money from the the economy he's an accountant what does he drive  a car made of dollar bills and the wind blows them no no no my brother's a penny pincher oh wow 
[02:54:30]  he's he's a as a matter of fact my brother is jewish really i find the combination very difficult  to believe really he is and you know how sometimes they are trying to look to every way to get an  extra buck that's a weird the penny pincher's a weird dog that's an aggressive dog now now that's a  mini pincher oh i thought i was just saying that my brother my brother is the kind of guy that why  would he my brother's the kind of guy growing up even growing up a man in the ass and not even have

[03:05:30]  as you're leaving you can take whatever you want because you figure the bill's been added they'll  never notice i took the cash register i shot the hostage  you're fucked up man you really are you're a pisser  as a matter of as a matter of fact you know what i yelled out to my principal when i graduated high  school what i i i yelled your mom's box to him

[03:11:00]  uh but i've had enough of bobo i think everybody else has though can i uh throw this plug out real  quick sorry we're out of time please friday and saturday the 17th 18th of this month zany's in  vernon hills illinois punchline comedy club in atlanta georgia july 23 through 25 and i'm 
[03:11:30]  actually psyched about this middletown new york my buddy's club friday july 31st saturday august 1st  it's called the manhattan comedy club 845-346-4242 it's a very small room will probably sell out  my buddy rich francesi owns it it's a great comedy that will sell out fast with the amazing  jim norton there and uh have a great holiday everybody yes have a safe and sane uh holiday  uh we'll be back on um i guess a monday to uh or tuesday we'll see what happens to uh report on all 
[03:12:00]  the fingers uh that have been blown off and mortars that have been fired into the faces of idiots that  light them and then look down the tube when they think the fuse went out happens every year doesn't  it right bobo right and yes my mouth is also known as an 80 holder no no no i'm i kind of wonder  there's probably a farcracker that probably blows up in steve's ass every fourth of july or steve's  once again i refuse to pluralize pluralizing is for communists according to my father 
[03:12:30]  actually i would think that'd be funny if a farcracker blew up in steve's ass yes  a farcracker that blew up in steve's ass a farcracker is if we put a cracker at the end of the hall  exactly that's a farcracker yes or a redneck not near and and and and notice how that firecracker  will have the foundry logo uh watermarked on it oh i get it yes 
[03:13:00]  as a matter of fact yeah as a matter of fact anthony if you were in a movie  i bet you steve might probably end up putting the founding logo so big that when you'd watch the dvd  this is how big this image would be oh that's cool to make it like that because everybody on the  radio can't figure it out don't come up with an object that you can relate to uh size like like  let's just say your brain people go oh the size of a pea or a walnut it'd be so small if you'd watch  the dvd you would you would need you would need a magnifying glass just to watch that movie right 
[03:13:30]  but it would only look big on on the movie theater you you know we really like you don't  yeah yeah i know that uh you're fun you're fun guy yeah i like having you on don't uh you know  you're a good man bobo yourself over the weekend where you gonna be bobo so everybody can know  where you gonna be i haven't i haven't figured out yet what i'm doing the fourth of july oh what  are you going out to your chick yeah that that's the plan i'm planning something over the weekend  where do you want to take her all i can tell you is i'm either taking her to fh riley's if there's
