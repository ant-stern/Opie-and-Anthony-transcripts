<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's unexpectedly vulgar introduction, immediately setting the tone.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton launched into a discussion of current events, focusing heavily on the controversy surrounding Rick Perry's association with a hunting club using a racial slur.  They dissected the ensuing debate on *The View*, particularly targeting Sherry Shepard with numerous derogatory comments about her intelligence and appearance, while liberally employing racial slurs and other offensive language themselves.  The hosts also analyzed Hank Williams Jr.'s firing from Monday Night Football for his controversial Hitler analogy, framing the entire situation within a larger commentary on political correctness and its perceived hypocrisy.  The show marked its seventh anniversary on Sirius XM, playing a celebratory clip.  Several callers contributed to the discussion, including a quarry worker using a racial slur to describe a type of rock and a teacher correcting the hosts on their historical inaccuracies regarding Christianity.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of a previous on-air blunder by Sam, who confused Manhattan, Kansas with Manhattan, New York.  This transitioned into a discussion of the "Jocktober" segment, its popularity with listeners, and the unexplained disapproval from a superior, prompting speculation about the reasons for the objection.  A message from "Danger Froggy" (whose Twitter handle was apparently already taken) was addressed, and the hosts then promoted their "Unmatchables" dating show featuring Jim Jefferies and Justine Jolie, playing explicit clips from the show.

A "Shit That Happened on This Day" segment followed, focusing on Van Halen's decision to replace Sammy Hagar with Gary Cherone, which the hosts deemed the worst decision in rock history.  They played a music video and launched into a vulgar critique of Cherone's performance and the video's aesthetics.  Listener calls debated the significance of this decision and branched into other "worst decisions in rock history," including discussions of musicians' deaths and poor career choices.  The segment concluded with numerous humorous anecdotes and listener calls.  This was followed by a "Jacktober" segment highlighting bad radio, focusing on a "Busted" segment from the DJ Laz Morning Show, where a man's infidelity was revealed in a phone call. The hosts debated the call's authenticity, suspecting it might be staged, and critiqued its awkwardness.  The conversation then touched on the challenges of producing engaging radio content, referencing a producer named Superman who lived at home due to a horse-riding accident, and the station's girl-talk segment.

Mick Foley then joined the show.  The discussion initially involved brainstorming absurd and offensive phone call topics, including one involving a mallet and ice cream, another about Gregory Hines' condiment preferences, and another regarding dating a man who lives at home.  A birthday caller, Jessica, engaged in an exchange of insults with the hosts.  A significant portion was dedicated to playing and discussing increasingly outrageous and potentially dangerous prank calls from a syndicated character named Carmen.  The hosts expressed frustration with the low quality and pervasiveness of Carmen's calls.  A prank caller identifying as "Fugitive Chip" initiated a lengthy bit promising clues to their location over three years, filled with bizarre and offensive statements.

The conversation with Mick Foley then shifted to his wrestling career, his relationship with Vince McMahon (including anecdotes about McMahon's reactions during interviews and a physical altercation with Bret Hart), his departure from TNA, and his current projects. Foley announced he was auctioning his "Medal of Reasonableness" for Vermont flood victims.  He shared anecdotes about his life, including moving his family to Florida and back to Long Island, and a humorous story about being pulled over by Border Patrol.  He discussed his comedy career, his desire for constructive criticism, and advice from Adam Ferrara.  Young singer Justin Hines, previously involved in choosing props for a Foley wrestling match, performed an a cappella version of "Solsbury Hill."  The discussion also touched upon other musicians, Foley's family, charitable giving, and his teasing a possible return to WWE as the anonymous Raw general manager. The auction for the "Medal of Reasonableness," benefiting RAINN and Vermont flood victims, was a prominent part of this segment, with Sam Roberts placing a $500 bid on the condition he wear it all week and promote Grace Potter's benefit concert.

The show concluded with further discussion of their seventh anniversary,  a post-show segment featuring Sam Roberts and Club Soda Kenny discussing their methods of passing time, and a heated, profanity-laced argument between staff members Danny and Mars concerning past grievances, communication issues, and accusations of unprofessional conduct.  The argument touched upon past incidents involving Master Poe, a former security guard, and revealed Mars's initial discomfort with the show's content, particularly its racial humor and references to child abuse, contrasting it with his current acceptance due to financial considerations.  The broadcast was consistently punctuated with coarse language and references to sex, drugs, and violence.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  What the hell am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony Show?  You got it, got it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah, this place is insane.  You guys like to cuss on this show.  You guys like to cuss on this show?  Yeah, I think a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:04:00]  This show is so disorganized.  This show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying that, well then turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Oh, good morning.  Hi. 
[00:04:30]  Hi.  Good morning and welcome to winter, I guess.  What the fuck happened?  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  I got, look.  It's official.  It's pretty freezing in here, though.  I turned up to fucking heat.  I was freezing.  It's fucking hot.  You can turn it down, man.  Maybe I'm going through menopause.  It's fucking cold.  It is hot now.  Can you turn that fucking thing down?  Thank you.  Not as cold as yesterday, yeah.  It's a little chilly, a little brisk when you leave the house.  It's colder today, actually.  It is colder today right now.  It is colder today.  Well, when I left my house yesterday, it was a lot colder where I live than it was today. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, well.  The city must be a little different.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Man, the winter coat is officially out.  Fucking bullshit.  Morning, everybody.  Hi.  A lot of weird shit in the news today.  Yeah.  We got the Hank Williams thing.  We got the Barbara Walters Sherry Shepard thing.  We got the Italian thing. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, more fucking.  And Obama's campaigning instead of running the country.  So, there you go.  Hasn't he been?  That's what he's been doing.  When the president does it, it's ridiculous.  When do they actually do their jobs?  You get the job.  You hang there for a little while.  And then you start campaigning to keep the job.  When do you actually do the job?  I think the first three months you're obligated to be the president.  And then after that?  Yeah, you're pretty much trying to keep your gig.  I could run this country, I'm telling you.  I wouldn't make strict rules.  If you're the president, you can't campaign. 
[00:06:00]  I'm sorry.  If that ruins your chances of being reelected, I'm sorry.  You got the job.  It's a very important job.  I think the best campaign you could do is doing a good job as the president.  Exactly.  Because then you'll get reelected.  Why do you have to go around even campaigning?  You're the guy on TV all the time.  You're the president.  By the way, this isn't partisan stuff.  Because I know both fucking sides do this.  No matter who the president is, they do this shit.  Partisan.  Partisan.  I don't do that partisan stuff. 
[00:06:30]  What does partisan mean?  Like you pick one side or something?  It's like you don't want the Holson, so you got to just have partisan.  Yeah, that's it.  You're only partly into what?  Well, that's what you had.  That's what Cher and Sonny had, a partisan.  I got it.  I like that.  You're not a Holson.  I like that.  Between her two kids, she almost has a son.  Fucking yell at your vagina, you stupid bitch.  That thing.  That disaster. 
[00:07:00]  Is she still dancing?  I have no idea.  I think Chaz is still dancing.  I want Chaz to win.  I really do.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, if she wins, it'll be...  If you really want to get into this for a second, if she wins, it's because everyone  just kind of went with the goof vote.  Yeah, they don't want to be...  They don't want to show that they have any bias to sexual orientation.  Because she can't move on that dance floor, man.  No, it's very silly looking.  I love the video, though.  You don't have to sit through the show.  You can just download the video. 
[00:07:30]  What video?  I don't watch these videos.  Any videos of that fat slob trying to dance?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Seven years ago today.  Seven years ago.  We started on satellite radio.  Today was the day seven years ago.  I see on the Twitter a lot of people already saying happy anniversary and all that, and  I appreciate it.  Seven years?  Believe it or not.  And a lot of people calling in already, and on the instant feedback.  Seven fucking years ago today.  Damn, yo's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember it like it was seven years ago.  There's our seven years clip. 
[00:08:00]  I hate this place.  Nothing works for you.  Oh, yeah.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  I hate this place.  Nothing works for you.  Been here for seven years.  Seven years.  How'd I find that, Iraq?  You fuck.  Man, that's probably long gone.  Nah, he says I got it.  Seven years.  Remember that asshole?  Oh, yeah.  What was his fucking malfunction?  I think that was that Bellevue special or something. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And didn't we meet that girl that was on there?  Oh, yeah, we did.  She called in.  The daddy girl.  She was crazy.  She would have been a good lay.  God, that was seven years ago?  Seven years.  I hate this place.  Look at that.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Yeah.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place. 
[00:09:00]  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I swear to God, we should be just cranking this clip through the halls today.  And I think a lot of people would appreciate it.  That is perfect for today.  It describes Sirius XM, not our anniversary.  In person.  Oh, Amy.  Whoa.  In person.  What?  What?  Oh, boy.  I wanted to play the clip again.  What are you doing?  What is that, your hunting lodge or something?  I guess you're not allowed to say it.  No, now you can't even describe it. 
[00:09:30]  It's a good story.  What?  You can't describe it.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Stupid Sherry Shepard, right?  Yeah.  She stinks.  She's as dumb as they come.  She thought the earth was flat at one point?  Yep.  She's a dummy.  They said, is the world round?  She goes, I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll tell you who is round.  Really?  I'll tell you who's round.  Yeah.  Sherry Shepard.  Sherry Shepard. 
[00:10:00]  She works out at my gym, and it's a big beach ball with legs.  It's disgusting.  She's awful.  She is one big round.  She's probably rounder than the earth.  Really?  You know how they do the cue ball earth thing?  Yes.  And they tell you that the earth is actually smoother than a cue ball?  If you scaled it down, of course.  If you scaled it down, yes.  I bet you she's rounder than fucking planet earth.  That is a disgusting woman.  And I guess they got into a little bit of a dispute yesterday on The View.  The girls of The View get into a dispute over the use of the N-word in conjunction with 
[00:10:30]  the story of the niggerhead hunting lodge.  Oh, boy.  You said it.  It makes everyone very uncomfortable.  Stop smiling.  Oh, I know.  It's really uncomfortable.  I've been painting rocks all day yesterday.  I was just out there slathering paint on rocks.  Just throwing them in your neighbor's yard. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  To find.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  That word again, man.  It's very uncomfortable when I hear it.  Well, Perry apparently had a little camp he went to, a little hunting lodge.  What did he call it?  His family.  I don't know what he called it.  Oh, that's fair.  But the rock in front of the place was painted with a niggerhead.  Oh, boy.  There it is.  And that was the camp's name.  Very uncomfortable.  But then it was painted over.  And no one could tell how, when it was painted over.  No one knows. 
[00:11:30]  No one knows.  Some people said it was already painted over and that some of the word was bleeding through  at some point.  And then it was painted again.  But others saying they're making much too much of this story.  Of course they are.  We go from there.  And the ladies of the view, of course, got into it.  And Barbara Walters actually used the word, look out, people.  Well, you know what?  I think Barbara Walters enjoys using that word.  She is old school.  Right before, can you fuck me? 
[00:12:00]  I know you're married, but.  She's an old broad, but I bet you she kind of enjoys that word.  Maybe toss it around a little bit.  I think she might have tossed it around.  Yeah.  Yeah, the girls got into it.  The gals?  It was a whoopee saying it a bunch of times.  Barbara said it once.  Uh-huh.  And then a German shepherd, she, see what I did there?  What? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  She got in there and said she don't like the way Barbara even said it.  The beach ball with legs?  Yeah.  And Barbara shouldn't say it.  And then whoopee, it's okay.  Oh, really?  What's the difference between Barbara and whoopee?  Well, did whoopee combat it?  I don't think so.  Why would she?  That is the dumbest argument ever.  That black people can say it and white people can't.  It is the stupidest argument ever.  There's consequences.  You can't walk around the street and just casually start throwing that word around.  You're going to get punched in the face.  But everyone should be allowed to use every fucking word out there. 
[00:13:00]  Especially if everybody else is using it.  It's a dumb argument.  I'm sorry.  It is stupid.  Let's see what the girls with a view said about that.  And it goes with all the words.  The fag word.  What?  Only gays are allowed to use that one now.  Queer.  You know, they love the word queer.  Get the fuck out of here.  Queer's okay.  That won't get your career ruined.  Nigger and faggot are the two.  Retard now is getting there.  Yeah.  And the only thing.  People just have to.  People don't like that either. 
[00:13:30]  What?  Yeah, chink you can't use.  Chinky chink.  I don't like that.  Chinky chink.  I don't like that.  How can you not use it when describing a news story?  Like, for Barbara Walters to be criticized.  Well, for the newspaper to write,  And asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.  It's like, what are we, fucking children?  When I first heard this story break, I heard it on CNN.  And the newscaster.  Actually, I had to explain why she was using the real word.  We went through this whole thing about,  I'm going to say the actual word.  Like, hold on to your hats, kids. 
[00:14:00]  No, don't do that.  Hold on to your hats.  And she was freaking out.  And then proceeded to tell the story.  Right.  And use, oh, the dreaded word.  And there's no reason you have to preface it with a fucking apology already.  TV's retarded.  Yes.  What, they sit there assuming that people at home are going to be just extremely shocked by hearing a word?  No one's shocked by it.  Especially when it's associated with a big news story? 
[00:14:30]  Black people ain't shocked by it because a large percentage of them use the word.  And white people aren't shocked by it because a large percentage of them use the word.  That's how it works.  So, Whoopi and Barbara talk about Rick Perry.  They use the N-word.  It's dumped out.  So, you're going to kind of hear it.  It got dumped out?  Oh, yeah, man.  By TV?  No way.  Wait, The View dumped Barbara Walters or Whoopi saying niggerhead to describe a news story?  ABC, which is Disney owned, right?  But they're describing a news story and they dumped it? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is where we are in our society.  Whoa!  What a fucking weak fucking country.  I didn't even know they had dumped it.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  Now, Rick Perry is under fire for belonging to a Texas hunting club on a property that  was named...  We need someone to fill in the blanks.  Who wants to fill in the blanks today?  Well, it's going to just tap out.  So, do you want to say the word in?  It gives you an excuse to say the word.  Do you want to say it?  Is it bleeped when Whoopi says it?  Yes. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, it is.  All of them.  So, know when to fucking put the word in so the listeners know what's going on here.  I'd be like Whoopi.  Hold on.  Now, Rick Perry is under fire for belonging to a Texas hunting club on a property that  was named...  Niggerhead.  Okay.  Now, and when the candidate, Herman Cain, talked about it, how radically insensitive it  was yesterday, he didn't use the term N-word, which I guess is what we're supposed to be  saying now. 
[00:16:00]  It's so hard to know what to say now.  So, I just...  Hey, you stupid bitch.  You're on TV.  You could change that.  You're a comic.  Why don't you act...  Think like a comic.  Exactly.  For Christ's sake.  She was defending.  What?  She was defending.  What?  I'm all excited.  What?  She was defending that he could have used it.  She didn't think it was a good thing that he didn't use it.  Oh, I just stopped it a little too soon.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, Whoopi.  Sorry about back there.  I didn't mean it.  We love you.  You nappy-headed hoe.  I'm an A-H.  What?  What happened?  That's comedy. 
[00:16:30]  Comedy sin.  Oh.  Mom, mom, mom, mom.  Nappy-headed hoe.  We're supposed to be saying now.  It's so hard to know what to say now.  So, I just use the word.  Okay?  You know, I find that so interesting that you did.  Because when Herman Cain said this yesterday, he was on with Christian Amonpour.  And he said...  Nigo-head.  We never say it here.  The name of this camp that Rick Perry's father leased, there was a sign that said...  On a rock.  Nigo-head. 
[00:17:00]  Okay, that's the difference between the way you and Whoopi say it.  That's why...  But let me just finish.  Barbara runs a show.  I would kick fucking Sherry Shepard and her beach fucking ball body out.  On the street.  But there's a reason that they have her there.  It's like, I don't...  Like, the one conservative woman they have is a dummy, Hasselbeck.  And then they have...  She doesn't think she's a dummy.  But she is.  And Shepard's a dummy, too.  Shepard's a dummy, too.  They're supposed to balance each other out, right?  It's really weird.  Like, Barbara's the smart one. 
[00:17:30]  You know, the smart white lady.  And Whoopi is smart.  And Joy is smart.  But then they have to have a couple of dummies.  Hasselbeck's a dummy.  And, uh...  They need your left-leaning dummy and your right-leaning dummy.  But there really are no left-leaning dummies.  I mean, there's a black dummy, but that doesn't count as left-leaning.  Yeah, I think it is.  And then there's a white dummy, which is Hasselbeck.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  I think you just assume Sherry Shepard is a left-leaning dummy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think?  Unless she leans forward.  She doesn't look...  Well...  She leans forward after eating. 
[00:18:00]  She can't lean in any direction.  More trouble with saying something politically incorrect and Hank waves...  We're just a bunch of fucking babies in this country.  Yeah.  Fucking babies.  Babies!  A bunch of white people scolding each other in mock outrage.  I know.  I know.  Mock outrage.  Ugh.  There really is no outrage.  Sherry Shepard now gets on the fact that she doesn't like the way Barbara uses it.  But she's okay.  Whoopi's okay.  With Whoopi using it.  Right.  It's just stupidity as a human being. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Does she...  Does she explain herself?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Well, as long as she explains herself, I'm sure this will make a lot of sense.  Yeah.  I feel differently from Whoopi.  Because, I mean, and I'm not saying how you feel.  When I heard you say it, it was fine.  You said it a different way.  When I heard you say it, I didn't like the way you said it.  Because when you say it, you say, and I...  Why?  Do you think The Rock said, nigga head?  No, you dumb fuck. 
[00:19:00]  She's stupid.  She says...  Because now, now, it's the age old argument that if someone says, like, yo, my nigga, it's  okay.  But then if you add the ER at the end and say nigger, then it's not okay.  Especially a white person saying it.  So Barbara apparently said, nigger.  are because that's what the story is about and that's what the story is that's what was painted  on the fucking rock right it wasn't painted by a hip-hop guy it was painted by some old white  racist guy that that fucking had the hunting lodge many years ago i would assume so all her 
[00:19:30]  argument is already stupid it's already stupid it's already stupid oh god you said it because  when you say it you say and i and i don't like here you didn't it's just it's i'm not sure i know  it's a semantic thing but it's something that goes through my body forgive me if i didn't say it  exactly the same way even if you didn't you wouldn't say it the right way i mean and there's 
[00:20:00]  nothing on you barbara that's what i'm saying there's nothing on you because i'm white that i  shouldn't use it it's something about hearing you say it that that just a white person should use that  word you know i feel differently from from other people i don't like it when you use the word now  i have used it with my friends with my family i don't say it like you so it's a when you say it  it's a different connotation i could say something i don't understand why i know you probably would  and i probably could never explain it no i can't explain the oppressive that's also the cop-out of  the century or the two centuries is the fact that it's like no look you haven't been through it 
[00:20:30]  so i can't explain to you why you can't say it but just you can't say it no fuck you i say  whatever i want i say it loudly how about proudly what why does barbara have to understand the  oppression yeah to have the same freedom that's the shit i hate same gives a fine freedom of speech  right baby i like excuse maker i like barbara walters there though she's basically saying what  we're saying that everyone should be able to say it she should have dropped it on her that's a 
[00:21:00]  news story of course it said niggerhead i'm sorry that's what it said right god almighty we  can't read news stories without abbreviating and hyphenating put a little funny exclamation point  asterisk country of assholes it's kind of scary that the old white broad is the one that's more  open-minded about it than any of them yeah what a phony sherry shepard is what a duncey open-legged  about it back in her day i hear what's that and open-legged about it in her day so i hear  this broad can't even do a sit-up correct the correctly yeah roll sideways every time she tries 
[00:21:30]  what a disaster so that's uh what happened on the view yesterday that's that's great that's that's  where we're at right now just more dumb shit from dumb people on tv can't say anything again it's the  news story the whole news story is based on what was written on the rock and uh the fact that you  can't say it is a travesty it's a it's a pussy like jimmy said this this mock outrage and no one 
[00:22:00]  really gives a shit about it just you're supposed to give a shit or something yeah go away sherry  shepherd you can use it oh i use it my friends use it my family uses it really but we use it different  oh how you call each other uh that is that what the thing is and barbara has to fucking yell it out  in a soundproof room somewhere in our house so she doesn't get in trouble if the word is so bad 
[00:22:30]  then then no one should be saying why would she use it why would she use it if your group is using it  left and right then what then i guess the word's not that bad now it's not that bad now if you're  comfortable hearing it at all it's right why don't you just admit it's a it's a racist thing you just  don't want white people saying the word exactly but we could say it uh among ourselves it's this  little power shit it's this little power thing that a lot of black people try to use uh as like  no you can't do that oh we can you can't sorry by the way i don't really use the word but i i think 
[00:23:00]  people should be allowed to if they want to i make up you know godspeed for you godspeed if you want to  use that word but i i i yeah i usually don't i usually don't only when it needs to be said like  when reporting a news story oh yeah stuff like that say the n-word never because again it's it's  childlike to say that and it's phony it's fake all the people that thought we were assholes like  all right with the imus complaints do you see where it goes of course this is why it's like fucking  pathetic that's why i'll never give that shit up nappy headed hoe was completely acceptable for

[00:26:30]  you'll teach your son jeffrey my son jeffrey asked me if the world flat i guess i will go  joy that was good when you already worked this question out they talked over because she was  she was gonna say what she would tell her son i would love to know what she would tell her son  that mommy is an idiot yeah she's there to be a clown look it up she's there to be a clown yeah  that's why she's on that show she's a clown uh she's a dumb that's what she's she's not a bright 
[00:27:00]  woman no um and that's like whoopie is seeing they all have roles whoopie is the smart black  woman right yeah they are she's the dumb black woman they cast these shows yeah i have barbara  and joy are smart and sherry and what's her name hasselbeck is done i'll tell you man when she gets  on that treadmill her fucking thighs hit hit my thighs the fuck pig let's spread out these treadmills  a little uh a little wider does she dress sexy in the gym oh she's awful too she's a matter of fact i  haven't even seen her in a long time i was on the treadmill once and i swear to god i saw her 
[00:27:30]  walking up the stairs and i thought it was a beach ball with legs she's gonna say that a million times  because it's the best way to describe her or one of those m&m fucking creatures yeah yeah  yeah she's just round round with stupid legs arms and legs i fucking hate her oh god i hate stupidity  especially in the media what a horrid horrid body look at that come on man i used to be into tit  monsters growing up but that's just stupid no she looks awful yeah and she she actually she 
[00:28:00]  legitimately did not know if the earth was round or flat and said i just i worry about feeding my  children oh really throw that in so you don't have to right to deflect the real question and and and  obvious answer that you're an idiot because she knew she was in trouble did she lose some weight  is that what they're saying sam yeah i mean a while back oh no she put it back on  giant fat person she packed that shit back on fat person she's a great big giant fat person 
[00:28:30]  where's uh the second clip iraq hit it probably when he was around there was no jesus christ stuff  but they still no no they still had christians back then no i don't want to be sick they're  i mean they had their gods the greebs the greebs the greebs they had christians and they had  no i'm doing it i'll talk to them now what are they saying  no no no no yes oh the right the greebs came first yes the greebs first then the romans then 
[00:29:00]  the christians jesus came first before them so i'm not okay all right okay not on paper  okay yeah i don't want to turn this through it doesn't matter anyway they didn't believe in jesus  they believed in polytheism many gods you know i uh jesus came first she thinks why jesus came first  and then everything else follows why is there so many people that believe that i don't know  because they're why why is there so many fucking people that believe that they're sheep and i 
[00:29:30]  noticed a lot of these people especially like her won't accept anything because they can't wrap  her mind she can't wrap her mind around around earth but who who took care of the baby jesus then  if baby if uh the jesus came first uh all alone well he was swaddled but who was uh changing the  baby jesus's diapers all he needed was some swaddling the holy duty hey who's fine  who was wiping the holy duty no one had to out of his butt cracks really yes it was amazing another  miracle of jesus they uh there's a lot of people out there that really believe that the earth's only 
[00:30:00]  a few thousand years old right because they have i can't even fucking talk to those people carbon  dating these dummies because religion has been proven wrong every time by science they've just been  proven to be fucking idiots so they after a while they know how stupid they look like they have to  acknowledge certain things and they have to acknowledge um dinosaurs at first they said  dinosaurs were a fraud and dinosaurs were planted they weren't real remember that years ago yeah  and then these dummies had to finally go oh i guess they were real but those are the uh the great 
[00:30:30]  beasts mentioned in the bible fucking liars yeah could you imagine fucking noah trying to get  fucking dinosaurs on an ark it's wow that must have been that t-rex part must have been real fun  so instead of saying that the fairy tale about you know the baby just popping out of the pussy who  never had sex because sex is so dirty to religious people filthy instead of saying that's silly they  make carbon dating they give carbon dating a beating instead of realizing that the the virgin who just  had the baby because again sex is dirty so you can't have the cock going in the cunt is terrible 
[00:31:00]  oh did sherry shepherd have a kid out of wedlock oh boy that's not good if she believes i hope so  religious stuff well perhaps she did i don't know i'm just asking i don't know and then we got a  racist guy in the line you want to uh take this phone call all right all right we got uh ain't i  supposed to go into another room jim in india i'm right here hope in india in in indiana i'm right 
[00:31:30]  here excuse me hey good morning guys hi what's up what's your name hey i work in a stone quarry  rock quarry yeah stone quarry i am rock quarry pardon me all right yeah but uh we crush that  that white limestone which is relatively soft and anytime that we have any kind of tramp rock go  through the jaw crusher uh like like a black rock out of the field uh we call that a niggerhead  it's been called niggerhead for decades i've been working there for over 20 years and anytime that 
[00:32:00]  i mean this this any of these other rocks will will destroy a crusher so uh we have to make sure  that don't go through the the primary crusher well it just proves blacks are stronger they make your  best athletes you know the athlete is that jimmy the greek yeah that's another great clip of someone  destroying their career we try every day but no one's listening out there jesus 
[00:32:30]  the black handling equipment we also have a pedal on there that when we're going down a steep grade  it's called a retard pedal i guess we have to call it our pedal now you guys are just a pisser down  there at the quarry aren't you yeah how do you work the fag into your yeah how do you work the word  fag it into your racist day yeah you gotta pull the fag handle right when uh one of these uh logs  how do you work in that word sir every once in a while we call the foreman a queer okay yeah yeah 
[00:33:00]  yeah that would make sense he is an asshole right wow well it sounds like a blast down there at the uh  the quarry my friend all right guys have a good day we got a teacher uh checking in uh who certainly  is underpaid chris the teacher underpaid what's up i never said underpaid i'm just uh i think  teachers are overpaid no i believe that i'm just fucking supporting you assholes let's go chris  all right yeah yeah yeah underpaid uh not enough days off either uh no the days off thing is nice  yeah that's a nice schedule overpaid high on the hog i'm in deep shit guys i need help um i've been 
[00:33:30]  teaching a job here i've been teaching that uh the christians come after the greeks and romans  and that there were no christians before christ right so um and that the first uh example of life  unfortunately um anthony were in the great rift valley in africa seven billion years ago 
[00:34:00]  that's a long time ago sure is what do i do hey when my kid i gotta ask you something when my kid  goes to school is some asshole teacher gonna uh teach him some dumb shit that's not true  nah man all right i don't know what where you live i think you're still on long island but no  you're in manhattan now so yeah you're probably i'm not telling you where i am you're in manhattan  you're fucked maybe i moved already oh well i i teach right where you guys grew up  and i can assure you that we have the best and the brightest really what what i certainly didn't 
[00:34:30]  see it what school district uh don't want to say that's fair enough no worries you take a guess  i'll tell you if you're warm or cold harbor fields high school south more south wine dance  elwood school district very rich dicks hills goodbye smith town no no you're at uh ob it's close  i know i know i already knew go away dicks hills thank you chris the jews live in dicks hills 
[00:35:00]  dicks hills the jews love dicks hills dicks hills is a nice neighborhood they don't like um my kind  there no the wasp well and uh ryan's coming in he works at the chocolate chip factory oh no ryan  hey guys go over the chocolate chip factory what's that um we call the chips  see and then he just and then he just bails out and what we're learning i chop my phone 
[00:35:30]  yeah what we're learning is the words used uh all over the place apparently it is i don't know when  it's a news story um look i'm not saying just blurt the fucking word out every two seconds i'm sure it's  going to offend people but uh when it's a news story i think it's it's fair game to uh in context  uh say whatever the fuck you need to say i think i think like i think uh if you're black you got to  make believe the word doesn't bother you because that just adds to all right even make believe it 
[00:36:00]  doesn't stop uh like like sherry shipper was saying she use it her family and friends use it uh  it obviously doesn't bother it doesn't bother you the word itself doesn't bother you because you use  it so the word doesn't bother you other people that you don't want to use it using it that's what  bothers you uh well then go screw yourself because now it's a first amendment issue uh that you're  bringing up and not a personal i'm offended by that word issue you know some sometimes uh the first 
[00:36:30]  amendment can uh be not not kind of trampled over but you kind of hold your tongue sometimes because  uh something might offend somebody i understand that but in that case i don't see that as being  very offensive if if uh people that are offended by it are the ones using it all the time so there  you go more importantly and um the colts are now oh and four yikes did uh mr terry collins uh throw last 
[00:37:00]  night where's travis he knows this shit you know the saga of terry collins oh that poor son of a  bitch had to come out of retirement he already has a concussion he didn't even want to play this year  but of course peyton manning is uh is out for i would say the year big why would peyton manning come  back if the team's own four yeah he's not coming back this year no why take the year off he'll take  the year off but i want to know about terry collins and if he survived another game or not without any 
[00:37:30]  major injuries did he throw last night oh he didn't throw fuck because he's still recovering  from his concussion right concussion that he would not have had if he stayed retired if you watch the  game sitting on the couch with the remote which he wanted to do she was doing he was there he wants  to get back in there um yeah i'm sure he's just aching to play how's the beer gut is it going down  that gut's hilarious when he's in his uniform he's just like that gut is hanging out why would 
[00:38:00]  you do that why would you come back yeah they had curtis painter last night who the hell is that  he was uh he was peyton's backup that didn't play at all last year oh really yeah did he do all right  what was the score uh 24 17 he he did better than most probably expected him to right he threw two  like pretty good touchdown passes one for 87 yards which is longer than right payton's ever thrown one  yeah i gotta tell you um without that song i can't watch monday night football uh it's tough i didn't 
[00:38:30]  even know what i was watching i was all i was all confused and i'm like no this doesn't feel right i  can't watch anymore i don't give a fuck what the guy thinks i i like the stupid song to start my  monday night football exactly who cares what the guy thinks if it's a cool song you want to use then use it  because of stupid gary glitter i don't get to hear the oh hey at sports arenas anymore  hey i don't even like this song so i'm kind of glad i stopped i didn't know what he did it was 
[00:39:00]  but it's different each week there's there's new lyrics every week does he do it in a different  every week oh yeah well you know it's it's specific to whatever teams are playing oh i didn't know  that so this week it could have been really good right  we're coming by air and on the ground yeah  football's taking over the town terry collins sorry  we gotta get ready we gotta get right it's gonna be a battle in the nfl tonight stinks  it's turned into such a parody of what it originally was yeah it couldn't have been anything but terrible 
[00:39:30]  uh really quickly i saw the phones lit up i got all excited but it's a whole bunch of people that  wanted to call me a dummy why i was saying terry collins instead of curry collins that's carrying  yeah i know that i'm having a tough time waking up this morning i was excited like they're gonna  discuss some stuff now they just want to yell at me so what's up with hank williams he uh said  obama's hitler no i think he was using i don't even think he was saying obama's hitler i think he 
[00:40:00]  was saying it's like this doing that it was he he says like it's like hitler playing golf with  den yahu i think he was saying it's like exact opposites or things you would never see yeah and  they jumped on the fact that he was using this uh hitler analogy and people knew people said well  he's calling obama hitler but i didn't take it like he was no no you're right it was some kind of  an analogy and the mock outrage on the shocked faces of the fox morning people fox and friends  well we got the clip i guess this is what got him in trouble and got him yanked off monday night 
[00:40:30]  football his only gig by the way it's the only thing i know about hank williams jr that he sings  the song to start monday night football that's it i don't even know if he tours or anything  or puts out you know new music this is how it went down let's just have a little intimate  discussion right here i'd love to pick your brain about politics yeah all right so i'll start with  an easy question who do you like in the gop race all right they knew what they were doing  they knew they were gonna get something they knew they were gonna get something from this uh this 
[00:41:00]  wild card he's uh yeah loose cannon he's a loose cannon is this the girl that's cross-eyed on fox  and friends she's got like a funny eye yow i'm the only one that notices this shit she's the blonde  on fox and friends and her eyes a little fucked up i've seen it in a while you like in the gop race  nobody nobody remember the golf you remember you remember the golf game why do you laugh at that  there's a lot of people that think that way nobody i think that way i don't like any of these  fucking assholes why is that crazy to say nobody nobody 
[00:41:30]  the golf you remember you remember the golf game they had ladies and gentlemen yeah remember the  golf game that was one of the biggest political mistakes ever why that that turned a lot of people  off you know watching you know it just didn't go over you mean when john bainer played golf with  president obama oh yeah yeah and biden and case it yeah uh-huh what did you not like about it it 
[00:42:00]  seems to be a really pivotal moment for you come on come on it'd be like hitler playing golf with  netanyahu pause right there okay there's nothing wrong why is nobody mad that's not who who was it  obama and bainer why is nobody mad that fucking he called bainer netanyahu see everybody knows the  comparison he was making but again the phony country jumps on the fact uh that he said the word hitler 
[00:42:30]  he didn't call obama hitler it's not even close he's he's bringing up a couple that would look very  silly playing golf together correct and and uh hitler yes polar opposite opposite it's it's it's  he didn't say obama is hitler no one's gonna stick up and the thing says hank williams jr compares  obama to hitler no no not really oh my god it's not what was going on there we are so doomed yep  picking two people that are completely opposite of each other so that's obvious god yeah media just 
[00:43:00]  everyone does that are part of the media when you do that overly exaggerated comparison of two  people to show how ridiculous right it is for something else to be in right one place at one  time it'd be like mussolini marion or whatever and then you mentioned some chick's name uh mussolini  marrying amanda knox right yeah whatever she doesn't like italy anymore i don't think it's  i don't think she's going back to venice for anywhere that brought us guilty as all i love her 
[00:43:30]  right the fuck she's so innocent she's guilty as come on there were three people involved and i know  the one that probably did it the black no i was just saying three people involved playing golf with  net and yahoo okay okay not hardly in the country this shape is in the shape this country's in i mean  no so yeah i don't understand the analogy actually well it's well how do you not understand the  analogy protecting your own job oh man how do you not understand the analogy fucking protecting your 
[00:44:00]  own job it's obvious anybody of course you understood it so why don't you explain it what  he's trying to say there you stupid dope how do you not understand that that me guy i think we had  him on the show uh brian kilmeade yeah we had him on once he was kind of cool but it's simple he  obviously is protecting his job right there hey i don't get that analogy you don't fucking bring that  shit up how about as a broadcaster you go well what you're trying to say is because obviously hank 
[00:44:30]  williams jr is having a tough time forming his thought yeah hank williams jr seems like a dolt  yeah he does but you know what that is that was a very fair analogy of course two people that would  never be playing golf he was not comparing obama to hitler nobody is going to stick up for a country  guy no criticizing a black guy of course not well it's well i'm glad you don't brother because a lot  of people do well you know they're the enemy they're the enemy who's the enemy uh obama and 
[00:45:00]  biden are you kidding the three stooges that's only the one that he mentioned another guy before  herman cain herman cain makes more sense so you do have a favorite uh herman cain of of the guys who are  and gals who are running for president right now okay right now he makes more sense than any of  them because last time around you uh you were a supporter of uh governor's he's amazing like and  he's actually the guy he likes the best as a black guy in the race yeah like uh fucking wow  second in country that's another non-story that'll go pretty far today you put a statement out 
[00:45:30]  oh he did yeah is he gonna lose his spot on monday night football i think it's over so yeah  that's fucking stepping monday night football in the nfl all people are saying is he's comparing  obama to him what people should do is fight back and not support monday night football but they won't  do it oh no they won't do it do we just hear stuff differently than people that is so obvious to me  what he was doing it's an example of the difference that's pretty much what he said he's not apologizing  really good and i hope he doesn't read the statement uh some of us have strong opinions and are 
[00:46:00]  often misunderstood my analogy was extreme but it was to make a point i was simply trying to explain  how stupid it seemed to me how ludicrous that parent how ludicrous that pairing was they're polar  opposites and it made no sense they don't see it eye they don't see eye to eye and never will i've  always respected the office of the president that's fair and it's accurate and then he goes on but it  has nothing to do with that is ridiculous man oh god just when both sides are high-fiving on the 
[00:46:30]  ninth hole when everybody else is without a job it makes a whole lot of us angry something has to  change the policies have to change good for him yeah good for him is right but for some reason the  mainstream media doesn't see it that way weird uh all right so i applaud uh barbara walters for  hanging in there the babs i i applaud this hank williams jr for not apologizing sherry shepard's  still an idiot oh is she dumb man adult and whoopee very confused she wants to be a comic 
[00:47:00]  but she also wants to be on tv yeah she's very confused whoopee uh it's always uh whatever the  wind the direction the wind's blowing she wants to wear a couple different hats yeah yeah she's got  to decide and what you're doing can't be a comic and then also like try to like seem like you're  doing the right thing on tv joy's good she can read that line very very nicely joy because she uh  she can get serious talk about shit she puts her ideology out there which i don't believe in  uh but she can also turn around and and make it funny i like the joy and then i like the uh the 
[00:47:30]  whoopee unfortunately and then i like the barbs and then the other two dummies are tied for last  no just just idiots and they are as stupid as they come yeah it's amazing to me how this is a  story and nobody none of these fucking cowards at disney or any other company who know the  comparison he was making if he had said it's like hitler playing golf with baynard all right fair 
[00:48:00]  enough that's a hitler comparison right but to fucking say it's like this this crazy pairing  is compared to how crazy i think this crazy pairing is that's like driving a tractor at nascar  oh my god he compare obama to a tractor yeah wow no he didn't no he didn't dummies  sorry to yell but but that's exactly it yeah the media is just fucking lying it's a lot the outrage  over this is a lie and everyone's letting it happen it's based completely on a twisted fact and then 
[00:48:30]  the mead guy didn't even like uh try to help him out you know what i mean he was he could have he could  have said what do you mean by that are you trying to say something like anything your analogy is a  little extreme but uh right you know yeah he could have even said something like that well the woman  on fox at all i think you're comparing obama to hitler she didn't get the analogy i think she's the  one that said that someone that thinks that fox is edgy when it comes to race they're as bad as every  other network sure they're as bad as every other network it's just petrified bunch of scaredy cats 
[00:49:00]  and fucking fuck it fuck the nfl fuck the nfl they welcome michael vick back with open arms  and he does a sentence yeah guy murders animals they welcome guys who drunk drive who are fucking uh  who have uh domestic violence problems yeah that's all fine in the nfl but make a comparison that is  fucking the media lies about and you're out right yeah keep supporting football people keep  supporting football well my fucking assholes well my jets are two and two jimmy fair enough i got 
[00:49:30]  support until i uh know they're out of it for the year i think it's more espn than the nfl though  oh okay i mean yes espn cut his song i think they're part they're partners though you know what i mean  they kind of work together and i bet you there was some kind of phone calls between espn and maybe the  i'm sure the nfl but i mean disney is just so quick to to pull the trigger on anything bad  disney should have nothing to do with football i agree you know what i'm trying to say like there's a  huge corporate disney umbrella but guess what football you know fans are a little different 
[00:50:00]  than the than the stupid mickey mouse fans but maybe it is espn not that i shouldn't say nfl but  it's not them and the name itself disney jeez it was walt walt not quite known for his tolerance  no not so much i mean come on really walt might have appreciated that hitler thing a little bit  uh you might have liked that you might have liked that analogy man uh we're all just phonies this  country's a bunch of it really is a bunch of fucking fraudulently outraged we're we're learning 
[00:50:30]  more about that n-word and how it's used uh in everyday life keith what's up buddy hey what's up  guys hey hey i just wanted uh earlier we were talking about some of the uh racial terms used on  the job site and uh i work in the oil refinery in southeast section uh if we have a pipe that  blows out or a pump that leaks we get uh crude on the ground we just call it bigger juice  now is that something that i don't think that black workers will use it right no i wouldn't think so 
[00:51:00]  he hung out he's no they're scared i went they're like brave for like five seconds and they're like  oh my god they might be tapping my line these fucking guys but there's gonna say some races really  fast and hang up there's things that are like historic and and and you know how however  inappropriate it is it's part of history and then there's other things like him saying that that's  just plain fucking yeah but silly another 10 years and it's not gonna be part of history anymore 
[00:51:30]  because we're we're uh aggressively erasing history yeah yeah that's happening out there too but i mean  that is a different example that's just the guy calling up with a racist fucking terminology for  something at work no that's what they say uh yeah but it's it's stupid when they start then he was  scared and didn't want the follow-up question i gather he hung up really fast and threw his cell  phone away so they don't trace it when they change slave and master and what was what was it that did 
[00:52:00]  it was in uh oh slave and master uh a computer overriding something or assist it was a systems  reference yes that's ridiculous like well the slave and the master yeah when you have a computer  system you and and or a bunch of hard drives linked up you have this the master and the slave  unit and they change that because it's you know yeah but that's master slave thing has happened since  the beginning of time yeah it's a real thing yeah it's actually real it's part of history  can i address patrick logan on twitter oh who asked me p lo uh p logan jr what's up with you 
[00:52:30]  talking shit about conservatives for the last couple days i'm i'm not a hardcore conservative  but you're flip-flopping no i'm not because conservatives are absolutely as fraudulent as  liberals that's why your own stupid jimmy you can't have your own thoughts you have to either be  conservative or a liberal so you're not able to take uh some ideology from one part and some from  another or say that you know conservatives have idiotic ideology liberals have idiotic ideology 
[00:53:00]  see then you're you know you're not toeing the line here's where i'll bash the conservatives because  the liberals you expect this type of garbage out of yeah where are the conservatives defending  hank williams jr making a legit extreme comparison yeah where where's anybody defending this guy but it's  a comparison that's it's not a comparison to the man it's a comparison to the situation it's an  analogy to the situation of two people that would never be uh uh playing golf together it was an 
[00:53:30]  extraordinary example of something that is it was it was considered ludicrous that was his way of  saying them playing golf was ludicrous because you would never see these polar opposites he could  have said any two people he could have said you would never see a a hair and a tortoise you would  never see a pit bull and an infant or whatever the dumb comparison is and why pit bull and michael vick  exactly why by the way listening to that why did they instantly think that the hitler part was the 
[00:54:00]  obama part and not the bainer guy simply because of the location of it but by that logic they should  have thought netanyahu was bainered they understood the comparison in the moment i think they were just  panicking thinking about their own jobs but again it's fraudulent outrage but what if what if what if the  analogy because the analogy you're right you're not you're not saying one person is hitler so you  could say that that it doesn't matter bainer could have been the the one that was hitler if you want  to say uh you're you're comparing them to uh a fascist leader it's it's so fucking phony yeah well 
[00:54:30]  because he's and also because he's known as a conservative i'm going to guess that would be their  argument that that's attempt to them was obvious but if it's so obvious because of his political  leanings then why wouldn't the fact that he was showing a ludicrous comparison be obvious because  he said netanyahu yeah in place of uh bainard because he got dumb broadcasters it's just not  really stupid the outrage is not real of course hey where's that clip iraq i want to play together 
[00:55:00]  as we go to break the seven year seven year bank for it clay seven year seven year things have  changed in seven years seven year for the better for us right yeah oh yeah they're great i love it  all right we got uh mcfoley coming in today mc foley i guess he's got some big announcement that he  then told me we're going to be highly disappointed mankind dude love and some of them other names we 
[00:55:30]  got cactus jack cactus jack mankind i said to mankind sorry anthony oh yeah mike foley or something no  burrs you want to talk to a guy that made a comment online and got investigated by the uh secret  service yeah was it about was it about hurting the president let's find out politician dan in  kansas city yeah hey um i got online and got involved in a discussion group back when they 
[00:56:00]  were tossing around the thing about the birth certificate are you downplaying it a little  discussion group really yeah come on we try to keep it honest here unlike these stupid fucking tv  shows you're you're softening it by saying a discussion group well that's what started out being  was discussion group all right and i think it got overblown a little bit i wasn't aware of it but  i put in two cents on it something to the effect that if we didn't do something to turn the country 
[00:56:30]  around somebody was going to step in and you know do something i didn't say i was going to i said  somebody and immediately secret service comes in and they trace my phone number and call me at home and say we need you  come in for an interview and i go into the they want to come out to my place and i wouldn't let them 
[00:57:00]  because they said oh we'll meet like at the local police department or something i'm like no i'll just come  here and then i go over there and they keep me in interrogation room for three hours and they're  interrogating me and then somebody else outside my wife and trying to get our stories to not match up  and it you know whenever you tell somebody something in the government like i can be totally honest and  say exactly what i said they'll turn around and spin it to get you to fuck up and try to seem guilty 
[00:57:30]  well well i i think they're just trying to you know see how legit the threat is watch first 48  you'll understand what not to say to people yeah and they take that they take that president's shit  and i don't even want to say very seriously yeah and then they're going to sit you down and see how  serious you might be or if you know that if you know something so well the whole thing is that's 
[00:58:00]  what i learned is you see is that if you if they tell you you can't say great elephant then they mean  you can't say great yeah but you know what any type any type of perceived threat to the president  or a public figure they have to kind of look at it's like it that's their jobs dude is and they  investigate everyone whether the president's black or white or whether you're a militia guy or a liberal  any type of perceived threat to the president they investigate they have to yeah  but wouldn't you think that it's a little bit more concentrated now than spin before no i don't 
[00:58:30]  i don't think so either you know what obama's i think the most protected guy by secret service ever  because there's the threat of him being killed because he's a president and because he's a black  president yeah but any president that you said that about would have had the same reaction  they protect they don't protect obama because they they are politically correct uh reasons they they  there's probably a higher threat to him because he's black that's probably just legit  thank you sir well what do you think they don't find anybody for the republican nominee and he gets 
[00:59:00]  re-elected i don't know i mean i don't to be honest i don't love uh a lot of the republicans either  i don't know much about kane i kind of like him a little more than i like uh rick perry because i  kind of like a black conservative but kate doesn't have a shot what i'm trying to get at is you think  this economy being as bad as it is that it will ever come to a point where someone out there will  just lose their mind and try to act on once another phone call from the fucking secret service you 
[00:59:30]  enjoy your time being interrogated what's wrong with you i'm gonna tell you why dude because you're  giving legitimate reason to somebody trying to do that people like when hinkley tried to shoot hold  on when hinkley shot reagan he didn't shoot him because legitimately reagan's policies inspired him  to shoot him he shot him because he's a fucking nut and a loser and he was obsessed with jody foster  and he was a little attention whore should who should die in jail yeah oswald didn't shoot  kennedy because of his legitimate political concerns right so people don't commit political 
[01:00:00]  assassinations because they're legitimately pushed to the brink they're little scumbags uh and little  small people who are trying to take down a large person but see i'm not advocating that should happen  i'm not saying you are but i'm saying i know i don't think but he answered your question i do not  think the economy being bad will push someone to do that because the economy was horrible when obama took  over it was bad when bush was in office the economy is just going to push more people to occupy stuff 
[01:00:30]  yes we're starting to occupy more stuff a lot of occupy hashtags going on spreading to other cities  ant oh it certainly is it's spreading to other cities oh look out wow you might be wrong about  this one oh it's just these people want jobs out there ant well then go get a fucking job they  want jobs well they ain't working in my house ain't working in my house i'll tell you that much  i gotta cut back see so people lose their jobs oops sorry sorry all right dan thank you 
[01:01:00]  okay uh talk to you later bye all right and um speaking of kansas uh i just want to acknowledge  that sam was looking up the population of manhattan kansas yesterday oh i didn't forget that's great i  didn't forget no i looked up the population for manhattan and then kansas manhattan came up  and i said 45 000 and then i said it and that's what it was oh why didn't you yeah you didn't put  in why would you say that that's new york city i didn't realize that you're asking for the borough 
[01:01:30]  but see i'm bringing this up yeah that's new york city is i'm bringing this up as a joke and look  he's not yeah yeah no no mother mother would never say this no mother would go oh sam that's cute you  made that mistake yeah what did you look up next woody allen's movie yeah this is a joke it's just a  it's just a little joke there sam a little joke and you're okay it's all right show a little smile  yeah exactly smiling i said it yesterday mother loves you it's okay i've already admitted this we  didn't talk about on the air it was on the after show i don't listen to the after show 
[01:02:00]  should it was as big as i was having waffles jeez all right my god maybe that's where i got my info  from someone was listening to the after show and they got a hold of me and said boy sam is dumb  because he looked up manhattan kansas that is pretty dumb i don't believe that because that  implies someone was listening to the after show i don't believe that had a higher hopes for left  there okay okay then you guys want to roll into jocktober next or what well this is not mean  spirit one of the big bosses doesn't like jocktober i know oh i know i i was thinking that i was 
[01:02:30]  listening to the replay on the way in today and i heard uh the replay of jocktober yeah and it was uh  you know the part where the the hole is uh uh just not not getting the the joke correct with  the hotel thing yeah from yesterday and i was laughing it was very funny but then the next thing  that popped in my head is oh he doesn't like this there's actually a boss yeah yeah doesn't like the  jocktober that there are people getting a hold of me they want us to make uh uh uh cds yeah and sell 
[01:03:00]  them yeah that's how much they like this i've never had and we have a boss that says he doesn't get it  i don't like it i don't like maybe much twitter activity i don't like it maybe i shouldn't say  he doesn't get it but he personally doesn't like we have a i wonder why yeah why doesn't he like it  because it hits a little too close to home it's probably too real during his uh uh uh radio career  maybe he probably knows they're gonna hire half of those people yeah for a lot more money oh is he  someone who wears really tight slacks and a tight jacket i just don't like it i mean you know big ethel 
[01:03:30]  wouldn't do it i just don't like logan likes it jeez tell you that much i think logan enjoyed it  i didn't understand that i'll be honest i'm like what you don't like jocktober that's the first  person that especially this year now that we've been doing it for so long and everybody's on board  yeah it's the only person that said that i was really confused by that  it's uh because i think they take pride in this bad radio that's out there 
[01:04:00]  yeah yeah the fact is pointing out bad radio it's pointing out a lot of bad radio that i think um  might actually reside here in some way shape or form danger frog wants everyone to know that he used  to listen to us what and he understood that we were kind of uh roasting him yesterday it's not  roast implies respect no we didn't no you know what did he understand we pitied him too yeah with  danger frog i we told it like it is that you know he wants to be doing he wants to be doing more than 
[01:04:30]  he is in radio and he was trying and stuff danger frog but he wrote something like tell the guys i  used to listen to them i get it you know it's my turn to be roasted or something like that poor  danger frog yes he's got to be in hell danger is his middle name danger froggy is it on twitter yeah  all right yeah danger froggy so yeah i guess danger frog was taken oh really uh danger frog  frog that sucks so he's got danger froggy all right well well at least he has a sense of humor 
[01:05:00]  about it that's fine whatever yeah october next uh i don't like it i this looks like we're going  hip-hop next i told you shit well you know what happened yesterday you said hip-hop radio  some weird spellings right here you said hip-hop radio keeps it real yeah they do and that inspired me  i always thought they kept it realer than than than other shows like morning zoos we'll examine  that today oh boy okay uh jack tober is next and uh first this it's seven years ago today we

[01:09:00]  Take another little fish in my heart now, baby.  I guess Jan Joplin died.  Is that what's happening here?  You're kidding.  41 years ago.  How did it happen?  Well, it was the horse, the H.  No, she's dead.  Oh.  41 years ago today.  41 hit wonder.  You want to know the shit that happened on this day? 
[01:09:30]  I love the what happened on this day segment.  But we call it shit that happened on this day.  Yeah.  So we're not lumped in with other radio folks.  Well, I wouldn't want to be lumped in with them.  15 years ago, the worst decision in rock history was made.  Anthony, do you have a guess?  15 years ago.  Worst decision in rock history, I'm going to say.  Rock history.  And if you want to challenge me on other facts about this, that's fine. 
[01:10:00]  15 years ago.  What year is that?  I'm going to call this the worst decision in rock history.  So you're looking at the year 1996.  96.  96.  I'm not looking down at anything.  Worst decision in rock history.  In rock history?  It was made in 96?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  No, no.  Honestly, just a plain issue.  Nothing.  A mild flight annoyance.  No worries.  Dan's trying to figure out what happened 15 years ago today, which I say is the worst 
[01:10:30]  decision in rock history.  15 years ago today.  Did it involve Van Halen?  Oh, shit.  Give yourself a damn.  Damn.  15 years ago today?  Yes, yes.  What happened, though?  Oh, they said Wolfgang was going to tour.  No.  I think he was still kind of young.  Yeah.  They replaced Sammy Hagar.  With?  Gary Cherone? 
[01:11:00]  Gary Cherone.  Yeah, Gary Cherone.  Worst decision in rock history happened 15 years ago today.  That was a bust of room.  Boy, that one not work.  Was he terrible, Gary Cherone?  Or is it just a...  He's a really good singer and all, but it just was a bad fit.  Can we find him, Sam, on YouTube?  I want to hear what he said.  Or maybe he gets in New York.  He would also blow his voice out trying to sing Sammy Hagar's versions of some Van Halen  songs.  He was the extreme guy.  Yeah.  What was the song they put out with Gary Cherone?  What was the big song they were pushing? 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  We're back?  Better than ever?  Oh, no.  Oh.  Reads like a book.  Without you?  Oh, no.  Like a video and everything.  Oh, yeah.  It was windy, though, apparently.  Yeah.  They were so excited when they got Gary Cherone, too.  They thought they were going to continue.  Why is it so windy, though?  I don't know.  There's somebody frozen in ice.  Videos were stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there's Eddie.  Eddie.  Eddie's haircut is fucking horrendous. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, it's a hat.  He's wearing one of those.  Jester hats.  Goofy hats that were all the rage in the 90s.  I'll tell you what right there.  He looks gay.  Why is that?  Here's why people got annoyed.  Because his mannerisms, it looks like he's dancing on a fucking show tune.  Right.  His hands are all out and fucking splayed out.  Oh, yeah.  It worked for Mick Jagger, though.  Jagger.  But you know what? 
[01:12:30]  Good old Mick used to look a little feminine up there.  Jagger was more seen as, I think, you're right.  But I think he's like fucking chickenish and disjointed when he moves.  He was weird.  This guy was like.  Trying to be a little flamboyant.  Plus, Mick was such a proven pussy machine.  The song isn't bad.  It's uneventful, but not true.  It's uneventful.  It sounds like a Van Halen song musically.  Yeah, but it does sound like.  Yeah, you're right.  A Sammy Hagar Van Halen song.  He could do it in the studio. 
[01:13:00]  But live, he had a tough time with the Hagar songs.  He'd fucking blow that voice out.  Hold again.  Bring up Eddie Lee.  The beat is just who gives a shit.  He needs a hook.  Where's the hook?  The video stinks. 
[01:13:30]  He's wearing fingerless gloves.  See what his fucking show tune motions?  This is lack fucking lackluster.  Yeah, the song's starting to get worse.  It's lackluster.  It's lackluster.  You're right.  That's the only way to describe it.  It's like eating bad pussy.  All pussy starts all right, and then you're like, oh, oh, boy.  Second finger in, you're like, oh, boy. 
[01:14:00]  Here's the Van Halen chorus.  Where?  Wow.  It sucks.  It's terrible.  What a cheesy video.  And he's trying to do a Hagar impression.  Musically, I like it.  I'd rather hear Hank Williams' comparison with fucking Christmas music behind it. 
[01:14:30]  Is Van Halen touring?  Who's the guy now?  David Lee still?  I like the end of that video where Eddie's tongue falls out of his mouth.  Yeah, he gets stuck to the ice.  And they're like, what is this black pointy thing on the ice?  And he starts to kick it.  Looks like a cat's dick.  Nice tongue.  Goes to lick a stamp and his fucking tongue falls on the envelope.  Jesus.  I guess I'll mail this to him. 
[01:15:00]  AT&T got a fucking check and a half a tongue.  It's the Van Halen guy again.  Could someone deal with this dope?  I don't feel like doing it.  Sure, Ant.  Nick in Kentucky.  Go ahead.  Nick, go ahead.  How you doing today, guys?  Welcome aboard, Nick.  I just got to disagree with you on this one.  Considering that Van Halen isn't even that big of a presence in rock,  how could that be the worst decision in rock history? 
[01:15:30]  Well, it's the worst decision in rock history because you just explained it perfectly.  Fifteen years ago, Van Halen was still very much in the fucking game,  and they had to make a decision on who was going to lead the band  because Sammy was moving on.  And they picked Gary Cherone, and it was a bust.  Yep.  And that's why.  Now, when you look back, you're like, no.  You got to understand, back in 98, Van Halen was still fucking happening.  It ended the hit machine that was Van Halen.  I understand that they were a hit machine, but they, in the scheme of things, overall, 
[01:16:00]  from the beginning to the end, Van Halen is not really that big of a deal in rock history.  I disagree.  I don't like Van Halen.  I think you're wrong.  How old are you?  I think you're wrong, bro.  I'm 47, dude.  I love Van Halen music.  I just don't think they are that big of a deal.  They're not.  They were fucking huge for well over a decade.  What are you talking about?  I think Hope's right, man.  You know how many Van Halen shows we went to and broadcasted at?  It was like 15,000, 20,000 people.  What are you talking about? 
[01:16:30]  I got one more, though.  Oh, shut up.  Hold on, sir.  I got one more.  I think that was a worse rock decision.  Definitely.  Bradley Delp barbecuing in his bedroom.  Yeah, that wasn't smart.  That's probably a worse move.  See, that's exactly what I was hoping this bit would move in this direction when I said that.  Of course, there's worse decisions.  By the way, Eddie Van Halen.  I'm hungry for a hamburger.  Oh, my God.  He wanted to sleep and cook.  He was doing everything at once.  Multitasking in your bedroom like that is just not smart. 
[01:17:00]  What is that guy talking about?  Eddie Van Halen?  Look, the guy was a great guitarist.  And his leads, I mean, come on, man.  I think you're wrong, dude.  And I'm not even a fan of the band at all.  Sammy Hagar left.  Was he kicked out?  I forget.  It's been so long.  I don't know.  They had problems.  But they were still happening.  The band was still big time happening.  And they had a huge press conference.  We're moving forward.  We got Gary Cherone.  And that was just a bad decision.  I don't know what other singers were out there at the time. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  Or maybe it was just the songwriting.  Maybe Gary Cherone would have been a good lead guy.  But that song sucked lyrically.  Well, another worst.  Well, okay, this is pretty bad, too.  Worst decision in rock history.  This is from, of course, Fishman.  Great White telling the pyro guy, go big.  Oh, boy.  You know what?  You're right.  There are worse decisions in rock.  Thank God we're going with this bit.  Go big.  This is what I was hoping for.  I have a worse decision, but I thought this is what you meant.  Yeah.  It was when Buddy Holly said, look, I don't have enough frequent flyer miles to take United. 
[01:18:00]  He had one of those ghost splitzies.  Ghost splitzies.  And can I join you?  Hello, baby.  I'll bring my phone and do chantilly lace as we're hitting the mountain.  Chantilly lace.  Propeller in my face.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Yeah, that's a bad rock decision right there.  A few more coming in, huh? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Elvis saying, I'm going to take a quick shit.  Yeah, that probably wasn't smart at the time.  Yeah, yeah.  It's probably bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Harry Chapin saying, I'm going, Harry Chapin saying, I'm going to go to the moon or something.  Where's your silver spoons?  I like that one.  Thanks.  No, I don't.  Any more worse decisions coming in? 
[01:19:00]  I know one, but I don't want to mention it.  It's kind of sad.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Kaz Elliott said, I'll have a ham and cheese to go.  Dude, I was right there with you.  I'll eat this in my room.  Right.  Let's see.  Worst decisions in rock history.  Oh, yeah.  Seth in Illinois is absolutely correct.  Worst decision in rock history was John Lennon replying, sure, you got a pen? 
[01:19:30]  See, that's a bad decision right there.  You're so right.  Kurt Cobain saying, I have this itch in the back of my throat I can't get to.  George Harrison buying the first cell phone.  And eating it.  No, no, you're supposed to put it down.  Don't tape it to your head and sleep with it on.  George, that's going to be bad.  No, it's not. 
[01:20:00]  It helps me think.  It helps me write songs.  I was waiting for Kevin from Connecticut.  He's in.  Aaliyah saying, go ahead, throw those extra bags on the plane.  See, that was a bad decision.  Very bad.  And we're kind of doing rock and roll Hall of Fame rules here.  It's all rock and roll.  Oh, it's all.  Everything.  Oh, okay.  So that's why the Aaliyah thing makes sense, even though we're saying worst rock decision.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, my God.  Yes, is George Harrison buying eight phones and turning them all on and taping them to his 
[01:20:30]  head with masking tape?  I don't want to miss a call.  Might be Paul.  These are good for you.  Ding.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  See, Randy Rhoads saying, I bet I could get just a little closer.  Oh, see, that was a bad rock decision.  That was a horrid rock decision right there.  Chris in Ohio, Michael Jackson, Ambien's just not working anymore. 
[01:21:00]  He once said that.  That was a bad rock decision.  Vince Neil saying, hey, who wants to come get some beer with me?  Freddie Mercury.  One more dick can't hurt.  See, because you're a little dick.  Yeah.  Rob Halford saying, I'm not a priest.  Why don't we do Jacktober? 
[01:21:30]  Marvin Gaye saying, there's no way that gun's loaded.  That was a bad decision.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yeah, did his father shoot him?  Yes.  That's so funny.  Marvin Gaye Sr.  Same name.  Weird.  Gay.  Rihanna saying no to Chris Brown.  That was a really bad rock decision right there.  That's your lips.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Eric clapped and said, why don't you go get some fresh air? 
[01:22:00]  Oh, that's just not even nice.  That's great.  Wait a minute.  Oh, left eye.  Lisa left eye.  Let's go around this truck.  Yeah, that didn't work out.  That didn't work out well.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to do it.  Well, we got John back in North Carolina.  John, now we're just having fun, but you have to go back to getting serious, right?  Oh, boy.  Go ahead, John.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, am I on the line? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, I guess.  Yes, John, you're on the line, as we say.  No shit.  No shit.  Yes.  Hey, I just got, hey, I just want to say I'm a huge fan.  I know it's like a couch comment.  I just got back from Afghanistan.  Jimmy, you guys, you're fucking awesome, man.  Thank you, buddy.  I just want to let you know that I go through some really crazy shit, and listening to you  guys really helps me cope.  Are you the guy that called about Van Halen earlier?  Yeah, and I don't know what you guys are on right now, but I just want to say the dude 
[01:23:00]  that called in about, you know, trying to support the new fag that sang in place, Sammy  Hagar, I'd rather listen to two horses having sex than fucking listening to this guy fucking  singing Van Halen to him.  What's that, dude?  You phone crapped out.  That's just another John, I guess.  I'm confused.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was the same guy.  Oh, okay.  I didn't hear you saying it enough.  You phone crapped out.  I guess it was a bad joke.  I got AT&T.  Fuck AT&T.  What'd you say?  He said something about a horse.  Well, I was trying to say, it's a bad joke, Jimmy. 
[01:23:30]  You can tell me.  I didn't hear it.  Oh, boy.  No, but what I was trying to say is that the guy that said that the Sam Hagar singer that  fucking took the place of Sammy Hagar, I'd rather listen to two horses, haven't I?  We heard you.  Jesus, I'm going to drive my car into a fucking car.  No, don't do that, sir.  Welcome back, man.  Welcome back.  That's right.  Welcome back.  Yeah, you guys are fucking awesome.  Of course we are.  Thank you, John. 
[01:24:00]  Better than awesome.  Thank you, John.  Find better adjectives.  All right.  Or godlike with a hyphen.  Tommy Lee holding a pool party coming in.  Oh, that's funny.  God damn it.  It was a really, really bad rock decision.  Oh, heavy.  Yeah, not good.  Yeah, poor Tommy Lee.  That's a bad one.  He said something about, hey, who wants to jump on that little pale raft?  That little, that little, why is that raft getting blue?  Oh, I don't feel good about that one. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, no, it's funny.  Who keeps this shit?  All right, you get the idea, I guess.  Yeah, that's, uh...  Yeah.  Leonard Skinner saying, sure, we'll buy that surplus plane.  Oh, wow.  In Indiana, very good.  Jacktober time.  Jacktober.  Love Jacktober.  Is E-Rock still here?  I heard he's going home.  Why are you going home, E-Rock?  I'm here.  I'm staying.  But why are you going to go?  I don't feel good.  What's wrong? 
[01:25:00]  Throwing up and stuff.  Are you puking?  I was earlier, but I'm not now.  Now, do you think you have a flu or food poisoning?  Uh, I don't know.  I woke up, like, with a fever and everything.  Baby's feverish.  Gary Glitter not using a PC password.  Evil Ash.  Meat Curran's saying his baleen is infected.  What?  Is your baleen infected?  Oh, poor boy woke up feeling feverish and vomiting.  You have a tidalist in your blowhole? 
[01:25:30]  What are you feeling?  Seinfeld.  Come on.  Were you feeling sick last night?  Yeah, I kind of passed out.  Did you go to bed early?  You passed out?  Like, did you go to bed early?  No, I slept in shifts last night.  What does that mean?  Like, I would sleep for two and a half hours, three hours, wake up, and then go back to sleep again.  I know four hours a day that you sleep.  How hungry are you?  When you say you passed out, you mean you were so tired you fell asleep, or you literally passed out?  I'm tired that I fell asleep. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe you were walking around.  But then you woke up?  Yes.  Wrestling was on.  What?  Oh, wrestling was on.  Oh, you were up watching the wrestling?  I watched most of it.  Were you upset?  Because the roster left?  Thanks.  Who left?  The roster.  The entire show.  Everybody quit last night.  Is that why he was sick?  So wrestling's over now.  Good.  Well, Triple H is still there, but everybody left Triple H.  Oh, Iraq, is that what made you sick? 
[01:26:30]  All your heroes?  The referees, the commentators, everybody quit.  Why'd they quit?  Because they didn't like the way Triple H has been leading the show as COO.  But no one's going to buy into that, right?  They know they're just going to come back in a week or two, right?  If things change, they might.  What do you mean if?  You're right.  Things do have to change, because they lost the whole roster.  No, but no one's buying into this fake shit, right?  Even J.R. walked out.  So now what's going to happen the next show?  Just Triple H is going to come out and do everything himself?  And it's going to be empty.  The audience will be empty, because who's going to show up to a show where no one's there? 
[01:27:00]  I don't know, because the whole roster left.  Wow.  The roster.  And the referees.  Not the roster, like a closet.  A roster.  Or a frog.  Frog.  And the referees and the commentators and the cameramen.  The cameramen all left.  Yeah, I don't know how it's going to get on TV.  Well, obviously, Triple H is going to do everything.  Maybe he'll set up some tripods.  He's funny at comedy, so he'll pull it off.  He'll be behind the camera, then in front of the camera, then he'll announce the fight.  Why has Vince done anything?  Why does Vince step in? 
[01:27:30]  Because he owns the company.  Why is he allowing this nonsense?  It's his company.  The board of directors removed him from his position and placed Triple H as active COO.  And Triple H is fucked up so bad.  Now, let me just put this in quick perspective here.  All the years that Vince has done his Vince shenanigans, and no one left, Triple H gets 
[01:28:00]  put in there, and the people all leave?  Like, what could Triple H have possibly done that Vince hadn't done tenfold?  The problem is that he fired The Miz and R-Truth because they kept attacking referees.  What's wrong with The Miz?  He has an injury he has to sit out?  No, no, no, no, no.  So they wrote this into the storyline?  Vacation?  Is he getting married?  What's up?  Wife pregnant?  What happened?  Yeah.  He kept attacking referees.  Cycling through the roids?  Yeah.  Of course not.  He kept attacking referees.  He got to sit out for a few months.  And so after they got...  That sounds like a legitimate complaint. 
[01:28:30]  But after they got fired, there's an R-Truth.  Wrestling, fucking with the refs?  You never see that.  You can't do it.  No, no, no.  Time for Jack Tolber.  You don't want to know what happened?  No, no, it's okay.  Who gives a shit?  No, it's okay.  E-Rock was puking.  And I beg you, don't tell the people what happened on the 10 o'clock hour.  Oh, I will.  I beg you.  Don't do it.  This is one of those unanswered questions that waits until 10 o'clock.  Don't do that.  I beg you.  No wrestling.  There's a lot of people who are kind of...  I beg you.  ...hanging on there.  Let's do Jack Tolber.  Hit that thing, E-Rock.  It's Jack Tolber. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of rap-tastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Thank you.  So turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Yes!  It's Jack Tolber.  Jack Tolber.  Oh.  E-Rock, don't kill the messenger, but Al in Virginia wants to know if you're starting your  hibernation cycle, and that's why you were all fucked up last night.  Oh.  Yes, I'm storing food in my neck for the winter. 
[01:29:30]  Aw, poor...  You want to talk to Al?  No, we're doing Jack Tolber now.  Cool, all right.  Someone's producing the show from in there.  Wow.  Poor chubby kid.  Al has a question, and you don't want to take the call?  All right.  Sam, who are we doing today on Jack Tolber?  It's the DJ Laz Morning Show with Africa on Power 96 Miami.  Whoa, that's DJ Laz.  I'm looking at DJ Laz.  He's a very, very light-skinned black man.  Possibly Puerto Rican, I'm not sure.  Possibly Puerto Rican, possibly, I don't know what he is. 
[01:30:00]  And then Africa with, you know, the K.  With the K.  That's the chick dancing behind him.  She provides the attitude.  I wouldn't doubt it.  She's very sassy.  Sassy.  Yeah.  Is she a, you know...  A DJ?  No.  She's a host of the show.  She doesn't do the music or anything.  You can see right there.  She is, right?  Yeah, she's very light-skinned.  Oh, yeah, she's a light-skinned black woman.  Yes, but she is a proud black woman. 
[01:30:30]  What do you call a black female DJ?  DJ.  Well, I think...  What do you, uh, call a...  Uh, so what do we do?  We just play this stuff?  I want to hear...  Well, it's Jocktober.  Uh, DJ Laz.  Now, how does this fit into Jocktober?  Because normally, uh, hip-hop people, uh, urban stations, uh, come off as very cool.  Well, Opie yesterday said that he doesn't know about the hip-hop stations because hip-hop 
[01:31:00]  keeps it real.  They try to keep it real.  So, I figured...  I know they do great prank calls.  I know that about them.  I figured that...  Oh, boy.  And they got a little attitude, a little edge to their...  A little tood to their discussions.  A little tood?  Oh, yeah, they got some tood.  I like some tood.  Yeah, they do.  And I bet she jumps in a lot.  Well, yeah, explain this show.  What is, uh, the DJ Laz and Africa show all about in general?  Africa.  Africa handles the majority of the talking, so what we'll be hearing  is mainly Africa.  Uh, DJ Laz does a lot of mixing on the ones and twos. 
[01:31:30]  What does that mean?  Mixing on the ones and twos.  Well, he's, uh, he's spinning, uh, records, you know, and he's mixing them.  Oh, he's a little, literally a DJ on the radio.  DJ Laz in the cut.  What the...  What the...  What's in the cut mean?  Well, he's like DJing.  He's in the cut.  What does that mean?  He's...  He has his turntables, and he's, you know, like Drew Boogie does in here.  But, but Drew doesn't do in the cut stuff.  Oh, he's in the cut.  Drew's in the cut sometimes. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, he's in the cut.  What is in the cut?  Like the grooves of the record?  Sure.  Oh, yeah, you're in the grooves.  Yeah, because the records have cuts in them, so if you're in the cut, it means you're involved  with the grooving of the record.  It has something to do with the production of the record.  But that's what hip-hop stations do now.  They take like an hour of their morning show.  Like, on Shave 45, DJ Wonders in the mix.  Whatever happened to just spinning records?  The mix.  That's an old school?  Now you gotta say, I'm in the cut?  Well, because you're not just spinning records.  You're mixing and doing your thing.  Oh, yeah, it's all computerized.  You're in the cut.  They're not really doing much of anything anymore. 
[01:32:30]  No.  DJ Wonders is on Shave 45.  No, he's not.  I wonder about that.  Let's do this.  DJ Laz in Africa.  What town are they out of?  Miami.  Oh, shit.  That's a big radio market.  Miami.  We're gonna listen to some fucking big market radio right now, Andy.  Yeah.  It's a very segmented show.  Damn.  They do a few segments, and that's pretty much all they do.  Right?  Time for Busted.  Yes.  One of their segments is called Busted. 
[01:33:00]  Busted.  Now, I love this feature.  They call their friends and find out what they were arrested for the night before.  No.  This is DJ.  What?  No.  I thought that was their...  They call their friends get bail money?  See, I thought, because it's Busted.  No, that's not.  Why?  Busted is when they find out that a girl is being cheated on.  So they call the guy...  Oh, shit.  ...and kind of get him to fall into the trap. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, shit.  But little does he know, the girl is on the other line.  Okay.  Oh, that's cool.  Well, here we go.  And I like how you wrote...  I thought it was Busted out of the neighborhood.  See?  When they...  Bust.  When they take the buses.  Oh, that's pretty...  Hey...  I like how this shit is written, because it really brings it home.  Yeah.  Time for Busted, where cheating men get caught on the phone with their lady on the line.  If this wasn't so obviously real, I would say the acting was horrible.  Oh, but it's real. 
[01:34:00]  Well, yeah, it's Busted.  Because you can do this.  You're allowed to just do this.  Right.  Yeah.  You're allowed to do phony phone calls on the radio, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know the FCC says no, and they'll fine your ass.  Big fucking time.  But these idiots are still making believe they're doing prank calls.  And the civil suit that would be involved in actually having a guy...  Ruining a relationship.  Ruining a relationship.  And reputation.  And reputation.  And do that on a radio station.  Yeah, this can't be fake.  Just because you guys don't have the attitude that the DJ lies in Africa show.  All right, it's real.  I'm in the cut, motherfucker.  All right, it's real. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  So now last week, Stephanie called us because she thought her producer, boyfriend Joey,  was like cheating with his new artist.  Joey.  Here's where I called to set Joey up.  How many black guys are called Joey?  Yeah, right?  And why is every black guy a producer?  A producer.  Right.  Look, they...  I'm a producer.  What does that mean?  Unemployed?  No, they're just trying to get theirs.  Make it in the music business.  There's a lot of producers.  In the music business.  In the community. 
[01:35:00]  That's because all you have to do is buy a drum machine.  You're a producer.  And you try to sell beats.  Is that it?  Is that it?  Yeah, you just buy a drum machine and you try to sell rappers in the neighborhood your beats  for like a hundred bucks.  I'm a producer.  Exactly.  Oh, is that what they do?  Yeah.  A hundred lousy bucks?  Hilarious.  I mean, because you just meet a rapper.  Why don't you just sell drugs?  Yeah.  Yeah, sling some dope like the old school.  This is like I'm trying to really raise up out of the ghetto and become the next, you  know, whoever.  If you break it down, one guy might get lucky and sell some of his beats for a hundred and 
[01:35:30]  that's it.  He's not going to sell the second set of beats for a hundred.  Well, everybody wants to be the next Kanye West.  Oh, yeah.  Was that how he did it?  Yeah.  He was like, he, you know, he just kept making beats and making beats and making beats and  who would buy them?  Well, eventually Jay-Z did.  Beat buyers.  Oh, is that how he got famous?  Jay-Z bought his beats?  Yeah.  Half the songs on the blueprint are Kanye West productions.  Okay.  That's Jay-Z's best album.  I don't know what a blueprint is.  Wow.  I have no idea what that means.  That's fast.  Was that his beat that Jay-Z did?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:36:00]  Is that Kanye?  That's not Jay-Z's song.  Isn't that what Ernest Borgnine was listening to in a skit from New York?  That's good.  Are you ready for this?  So he's a producer.  His name's Joe.  Joey.  Joey.  Joey.  Joey.  And I guess Joey was cheating on his woman.  Cheating on his woman.  Stephanie thought Joey might be cheating on her with his new artist.  New artist.  Oh, yeah, new artists.  They convince girls in the neighborhood who can sing.  To have sex with them.  Because they have connections. 
[01:36:30]  And if they get caught, then they're just this new artist.  Right.  And you're crazy for thinking that some shit was going down with me and my new artist.  Because I'm the beat maker.  Yeah.  Where did Joey and Stephanie meet?  Where did they meet?  On whitenames.com?  It's fucking terrible.  This stupid Africa is about to get into everyone's business.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be good.  What?  Business.  That's what they say now?  Business.  That's my business.  That's my business.  I love it.  All right. 
[01:37:00]  Hello?  Hello.  Hi.  Am I speaking with Joey?  Yes, this is who's this?  Hi, Joey.  This is Jennifer.  And I'm calling from Huey's Chop House in Ball Harbor.  And I'm calling to tell you, you have won a complimentary dinner for two with a free bottle of wine.  And we would love to send that to you and hook you up.  Know what's going on here?  Holy mother of fuck.  Because I know radio history.  There was a very famous phone call with the Roses that went fucking viral everywhere.  Yes, yes.  And I guess that call was real. 
[01:37:30]  Maybe the original one.  Right.  And now every fucking hack morning show has to do the bit.  No.  And they just do it a little differently than the original.  I love this.  Yeah.  I just read, fuck off would be my response.  Right, right.  Like, that's exactly it, too.  It's like, who, if I got a call like that, I'd just be like, yeah, I'm not interested.  Because I knew like a sales pitch was coming.  Right.  No one gives you anything.  No one calls your fucking phone.  There's always fine print.  And gives you anything. 
[01:38:00]  There's always fine print.  You got to spend $100 to get this or whatever.  $500 if you take a survey.  No.  How about that?  Give me 500 bucks.  Right.  Just give me the fucking money.  Yeah.  So what's going to happen here?  I swear I haven't heard this ahead of time.  Obviously, they gave this guy a stupid prize.  But he has to say who he wants to take to the restaurant.  And then he's going to say the wrong name.  And then you're going to get the system.  What's it doing?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Do you listen to the DJ Love Show?  Yes.  It's the oldest, hackiest bit in radio. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  And I guess the first one was real.  And now everyone's just trying to redo that shit.  That radio magic.  Bottle of wine.  And we would love to send that to you and hook you up.  Yeah.  You know, I'm going to have to pass.  I don't think so.  That's fine.  You wouldn't like to come out and have a complimentary dinner for two?  It's no obligation.  And plus, it's a free bottle of wine.  I'm sure a young lady would love to come out to Huey's Chop House.  No?  Okay.  It's free.  Okay.  It's listening for me and for Raquel. 
[01:39:00]  You just said Raquel?  What?  Who is Raquel?  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to want to rewind and a re-re-re-play.  How did they get him out there like that?  That's crazy.  He goes,  Wow, he went from totally not interested into,  Wow, I really want this within a half a second.  He goes,  No, I'm not interested.  But it's for me and Raquel who I've been cheating with.  My social security number is 185-89. 
[01:39:30]  Because you know when you're making reservations,  you always have to give two names.  Right.  Always.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't even do the bid correctly.  The stupid broad is supposed to say who you're going to bring.  Who are you going to bring?  We need to know because we've got to put it on the gift certificate.  Or we have to embroider a doily.  Exactly.  I bet what happened was they recorded this and then had to edit it down for time.  Or the sales guy didn't know how to do it.  It was on the other line.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a sales guy.  So they edited it down and cut out the part where maybe she says, 
[01:40:00]  Well, who are you bringing?  Sure.  Because there's no way.  We need to fit in two minutes.  No, I'm not interested.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Bottle of wine?  Fuck it.  Three.  Okay, it's listening for me and for Raquel.  You just said Raquel.  What?  Who is Raquel?  Who is Raquel?  Oh, boy.  It's Stephanie.  Who the fuck is Raquel?  Is this the same girl or is this a different girl? 
[01:40:30]  Are you now a male whore?  Don't mention people's names.  Okay, just listen.  That's whose name?  You just mentioned a name.  Who the fuck is Raquel?  Raquel, she's just a friend.  All right?  She's just a friend.  I'm so embarrassed.  Wow, wow.  I got to hear how this turns out.  This is my radio.  That he said, don't mention any names.  Yeah, of course.  Before they said, you're on the air.  But then she covered it pretty well and said, well, you already mentioned a name.  So it was Raquel.  Right.  But people in their cars, like, buy into this? 
[01:41:00]  Like, it's real?  Oh, shit!  Dude, they're beating up the dashboard in this steering wheel going like, get the fuck out of here!  Oh, my God!  Just, like, punching the air in the windshield and shit.  It's crazy.  That's what I think.  They continue with the busted phone call.  Damn!  That's how it's written.  I had to say it's the emotion that the phone call conveys.  The acting is fantastic, by the way.  If this is fake, which it isn't, the acting is so good. 
[01:41:30]  The guy's horrible.  What?  What?  What?  Who the?  Who the?  What?  I don't believe this, so I'll just throw words out there.  But Major Nilsson, I saw.  She was saying that.  But Major Nilsson.  I've listened to a lot of radio shows, and if this is acting, it fooled me.  Yeah, yeah.  And I get fooled.  No, no.  All we need to know, because Stephanie wants to know who Rochelle is, is this this artist you're working with?  If you don't answer the question in, like, five seconds, I'm going to tell you something right now.  I'm going to tell you something right now. 
[01:42:00]  I'm a professional, and I will not be speaking about this.  You are not a f***ing professional.  Pause that right, quick, quick.  Can you rewind a little bit?  He didn't say what I think he just said.  Oh, oh, oh.  He didn't say, I won't be speaking about this on radio, did he?  Mm-hmm.  Did he just slip and say that before they told him he was on the radio?  Yeah.  They never said you're on the radio.  They never told him he was on the radio.  They never told him he's on the radio, and he said, I will not be speaking about this on the radio. 
[01:42:30]  They never say he's on the radio.  Because even Africa is using a fake name.  She's from the restaurant.  Right, yeah.  And you also, you loved it.  She is the girl, interrupts him from answering to say, you better answer this in five seconds,  because I guess that was her line.  Yeah.  But he was already answering the question.  He's answering.  I'm going to tell you something right now.  I'm going to tell you something right now.  I'm a professional, and I will not be speaking about this on the radio.  You are not a f***ing professional.  He says on the radio.  They never said you were on the radio.  Oh, what an idiot. 
[01:43:00]  What fucking...  This is so bad.  I thought the guy was really smart that he knew they were on the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  He picked up on it.  Yeah, he probably did.  Something right now.  I'm going to tell you something right now.  I'm a professional, and I will not be speaking about this on the radio.  You are not a f***ing professional.  I've been working my butt off to get myself to where I am, and I'm glad I'm entertaining  for you.  Well...  Now I just got done with a relationship because a girl doesn't believe what I do.  And you know what?  My best advice to anybody in this industry, whether it's movies, modeling, music, whatever 
[01:43:30]  the case may be, don't get involved with anybody.  Because unless they're on the same page as you are, this is the kind of bulls*** that  you're going to constantly deal with.  Why would he be giving advice to strangers when literally no one told him he's on the  radio?  No, no.  You're giving advice to the lady that's calling you from the restaurant.  Let me give everybody advice here, listeners.  And no sort of follow-up.  Hey, my girlfriend, why are you on three-way calling with the lady who runs a restaurant? 
[01:44:00]  What is this?  Would that be your first question?  What is this?  What is happening here?  Another good point coming in, Sam.  What's that?  Josh is very confused.  From Philly, he didn't know there were beeps on live radio.  Live beeps.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There may be...  Beeps on live radio.  Eight-second delay.  And in that time, there'd be...  I don't know how the industry works, but they can do it.  Obviously, they can. 
[01:44:30]  And there's beeps.  They didn't put them in.  Because unless they're on the same page as you are, this is the kind of bulls**t that  you're going to constantly deal with, whether you're a man or a woman.  You're always going to get accused of doing things.  And you know what?  It's going to drive anybody nuts.  And I did nothing wrong.  And now I've got my girlfriend who's just dumped me on the radio.  And I hope...  Again.  I hope there was a great, great show for you, Africa.  Really.  Hey, it's not just me.  Laz is...  I don't even know her name.  I don't even know her name.  She never told her name.  But she never said it. 
[01:45:00]  She never said...  How does one of the fucking boss guys don't get this?  This is great.  Oh, my God.  This is great shit.  And Jimmy fucking picked it out.  How do you not...  How all of a sudden...  Now, all of a sudden...  He knows everybody.  He knows how many megahertz are going out.  Hey, Africa.  Call letters.  He knows he's on the radio.  He knows what radio station.  He knows her name.  Weekday mornings, 6 to 10.  Yeah.  Right.  And I hope...  I hope it was a great, great show for you, Africa. 
[01:45:30]  Really.  Hey, it's not just me.  Laz is here, too.  I'm on your side, my friend.  Oh, please.  I've heard no evidence that you've done anything wrong.  Forget Africa.  I want you to send me Be Nasty's music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he wants to make some money off of it.  Send it to me.  Good luck.  There are some things that are meant to last a lifetime.  Tattoos.  A baby mama.  What?  Did they say the name Be Nasty?  In the beginning, they did.  Okay.  Real quick.  Okay.  Holy shit. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  That is terrible.  That is so embarrassingly bad.  I can't even pull off a fake bit properly.  That's terrible.  Yeah, that's a complete fake.  Holy shit.  If I, you know...  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to break the news to you there.  Wow.  That's terrible.  Wow.  I'm so glad you picked up on that.  I didn't hear radio.  Yeah, I thought I heard it.  It couldn't be that awful.  It makes it way better.  But then all of a sudden, they're having a real radio discussion.  Africa.  It's never been said.  DJ Laz. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Well, you're on the radio.  All right.  We're doing Jocktober.  DJ Laz in Africa from Miami.  It's girl...  A lot of R's in that word there, Sam.  That's right.  But girl talk.  Girl talk.  Girl talk.  Girl talk.  And a really out-of-the-box topic.  Yeah, this is like one of those things.  You know how some DJs are lazy and will just take typical, relatable topics just because  they'll get phone calls, whereas others will really go home and think of something that  is worth broadcasting. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Like, I feel like this is something that you're not just going to hear on any morning show  that's trying to talk to women.  Mm-hmm.  And Jay's very confused.  He thinks that they spell DJ Laz wrong and that there should be a Y at the end of...  DJ E Laz.  No.  Because those people tend to be that.  That's hilarious.  He's a lazy...  He is lazy.  He's fucking...  Those people.  That's funny, man. 
[01:47:30]  He's fucking lazy.  Good job, Jane Huntington.  Here we go.  We got the girl talk with Africa.  Chips, dating, dating, dating, dating, dating, dating, dating, dating, and relationships.  Family issues, money, sex, and more.  Remix.  It's all here.  Girl talk right now with Africa on Power 96.  All right, so let me just say, I'm not putting my, uh, I'm not putting Superman out here.  Superman is our technical producer here at the station.  Uh, but he is a sweet, cute, funny, attractive young man. 
[01:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, but he lives at home.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, he told me recently...  Hi, Superman.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, he told me recently that, you know, when he asks a girl out, you know, it's all good  until she finds out that he lives at home.  Right, Superman?  It's kind of embarrassing.  Okay, but you have reasons why you live at home, correct?  Yes, because I was paralyzed falling off a horse.  Okay, give me one.  And my wife has to scoop out my duty. 
[01:48:30]  I was on my own for a while.  Then I went for a horse ride.  Now I have to stay home.  Ah, shit.  That story alone proves there's no God.  She ends up getting cancer after taking care of him like that.  Oh, yeah.  You'd think she would get the pass from the cancer after scooping his hiney out.  There's some guy who has a message board name.  I think it's so funny.  It's Dana Reeves' lungs.  Jesus.  What an awful name for a message board.  Why would you do that?  Dana Reeves' lungs. 
[01:49:00]  Why would you do that?  She doesn't leave Christopher Reeves after the accident.  She scoops out his hiney.  Yeah.  And what she gets for that is lung cancer.  Yeah.  God, it stinks.  Keep believing in your God.  Didn't even smoke.  No, she didn't smoke.  Exactly.  Didn't even smoke.  No.  Imagine if she was really bad.  Imagine if there's things we didn't know, like he was getting better, but then she kept  throwing out the good stem cells because she liked to hit him when he couldn't move.  Wow.  Yeah, you'd think you'd get a pass.  I know.  Yeah.  God would go, ah, we'll give the lung cancer to somebody else. 
[01:49:30]  A few years of joyous living after he died.  No shit.  Wasn't she dead really quickly after that?  A couple years, not even, right?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  The girl on the girl topic.  Embarrassing.  Okay, but you have reasons why you live at home, correct?  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  Give me one.  Really quick.  Trying to save a little money.  Okay.  Honestly, I don't really have too many roommate options.  I could move out on my own if I wanted to, but I choose not to, so.  Superman.  Who wouldn't date him?  Apparently, these girls don't want to date a guy who lives at home.  So what do you think?  Is dating a man who lives at home a deal breaker? 
[01:50:00]  Ah, there's your subject.  That's the topic.  Is dating a man that lives at home a deal breaker?  Are we about to hear a phone topic?  That's it.  That's the phone topic.  What's the phone topic, huh?  It's not.  It's call up if, what's your opinion on if you would date a man who lives with his parents?  I would assume that for a lot of the girls that listen to this station, a guy that lives  at home is better than dating a guy you talk to on a phone and see through plexiglass.  Because that's his problem. 
[01:50:30]  Because those people tend to get in a lot of trouble.  I'm just saying.  Those people.  I'm just saying.  Do you think that the listeners of this show, or is it weird when they put their hand  to touch someone else's hand, they actually feel a hand?  They're like, ah, what is that?  It's soft.  Warm.  What the hell is going on here?  Plexiglass.  Are we going to hear a lot of sassy broad saying, no fucking way would I date a man that's living  with his mama?  Everybody's got an opinion.  And his mama's house? 
[01:51:00]  Well, I don't think so.  It depends on the condition of his parents.  It's like, if he just lives there because he's like a mama's boy or whatever, and he has  no job, that's one thing.  But if he's a self-sufficient young man who has a job and his parents may be ill or older,  then I would be able to deal with it.  So it depends on the circumstance.  No J-O-B.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a good day, honey.  Is that on?  Howard, good morning.  Hi.  What do you think?  Is it a deal breaker?  Not necessarily.  Not if the guy is the one that owns the place and is letting his parents live with you.  Yeah, motherfucker.  It's all about materialistic shit.  Thank you, honey.  Have a good day. 
[01:51:30]  You too.  Bye.  And we've got a lot of text messages and responses on our Facebook page.  Carly Ann says, I would usually say it would be a deal breaker, but this economy has changed  and barely anyone in their 20s can afford it.  So, is dating a man who lives at home a deal breaker?  5-5-0-9-6-9-6.  Ladies, be honest.  Because it's controversial.  Be honest.  Do they call him a lie a lot?  Yeah, well, I mean, a topic this controversial. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Be honest, man.  Didn't they do it, though?  Why are they continuing?  Yeah.  Well, there's no reason to stop.  They had a girl when they had a con.  Stop that great fucking dialogue there.  They didn't even really have...  It was all like...  All three calls started with, it depends, or it could be, or possibly.  There was no sort of...  Right.  Definitive point.  No.  And you write here, girl talk lasts a really long time.  Fuck.  Yeah, there's another girl talk clip.  Is it the same topic? 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  Yes.  Girl talk is one topic.  I have a question.  Do they...  Radio shows really do that?  Do they really get, like, a topic that's so obvious just to get the conversation going?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Yes, yeah.  Like, this is how it works.  I've been to certain show meetings, and the guy, the Superman guy will say, oh, yeah,  nobody will date me because I'm living at home with my parents.  Oh, wait.  Good spontaneous subject.  And then I have a girl say, you know what?  I could really get the phones lit up.  Yeah.  If we...  We'll use that for girl talk. 
[01:53:00]  It's all about getting those phones to light up, Sam.  Yeah.  Do you think we should do that?  Because I have a couple of, I think, very...  They're, like, kind of hacky questions, but I think it could get people calling in.  Fair enough.  Do you think you could get the phones ringing with a subject?  I think we could learn from regular radio, Jimmy.  Yeah, maybe.  Let's try to get a phone topic.  We shouldn't be so judgmental.  Look, you look at his cookie.  I just have a bad feeling that a bomb is coming.  Let's go. 
[01:53:30]  Somebody committed.  Let's go.  These are the three.  All right.  Let's see.  One at a time so the callers don't get confused.  Yeah.  Rocky wrote ice cream.  Should you use a hammer or a mallet to pound it into the anus of an invalid?  Oh.  Be honest. 
[01:54:00]  I like turtles.  I am the werewolf.  What were the choices?  No, he's got two more topics.  A mallet or a hammer.  A mallet or a hammer.  Yeah.  He has two more topics.  I like Jimmy Talk.  Jimmy Talk's good.  Jimmy Talk.  You got another one?  Sure.  And this is proof that you should always save the best one for last. 
[01:54:30]  I think I'm really starting the pyramids upside down in this bit.  What are the top 50 condiments Gregory Hines would enjoy on his English muffins?  50.  And who cares?  I'm glad he's dead.  Well, it's a good phone topic.  It's a good phone topic. 
[01:55:00]  We would have to take 50 phone calls.  Oh, God.  We would have to take 50.  And if it's three minutes in, you'd be like, on paperclips?  Shoes?  Well, a lot of people say mallet, by the way, if you need to know.  And the third one?  I should quit it, too.  Fair enough.  Let's go back to...  What color tie matches a colostomy bag?  That was my third one.  That was my third one.  DJ Les and Africa continue girl talk.  Girl talk right now with Africa on Power 96. 
[01:55:30]  Is dating a man who lives at home a deal breaker?  Joe Cruz says, the funny thing is, a guy would never care if this situation was reversed.  Women put too many rules into effect, and that's why girl talk exists.  Just go with the flow and stop living by BS rules.  Drinks on Zong.  Thank you.  You got it.  So what do you think?  Is dating a man who lives at home a deal breaker?  5-5-0-9-6-9-6. 
[01:56:00]  Good morning.  Hi, honey.  Is dating a man who lives at home a deal breaker?  Well, there's exceptions to every rule.  And moving out is not easy.  But if I can do it, they can do it.  Plus, I'm not going to be boom-boom at my house every single time.  Right.  Like, then they're going to start switching over every day and coming...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I need my own space.  I totally get that.  That's fucking...  Yeah.  Smushing.  Listen, that's a big issue.  The privacy issue is huge.  Absolutely.  Like, I don't want to...  I mean, okay, yeah, bombs are important, but I don't want to be hanging out with your  mom every single day.  Oh, God.  Thank you, honey. 
[01:56:30]  Have a good day.  My mom's cool.  I know your mom's cool.  I've met her.  Wait.  Who's this?  We're just kidding.  It's Jessica, by the way.  Who's Jessica?  Hi, Jessica.  Who's Jessica?  Hi.  I'm great.  It's my birthday.  Oh, happy birthday, my love.  Good girl.  Thank you.  Have a good birthday today.  How old are you?  You never ask women's days, okay?  I'm 20-something.  I've been turning 25 for the past three years.  Happy birthday.  That'd be 28 then, you dumb cunt.  Thank you.  I'm fine.  You got your body right here.  Shut up, dog.  Shut up, dog.  They are... 
[01:57:00]  What happened?  She's sassy.  I was checking my Twitter.  What happened?  Was it good?  It was Jessica's birthday.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, Jessica.  That's when the phone lines aren't lighting up, so you got to keep one on the line for a  little while.  Oh, yeah.  For a little while.  Until the other phone rings.  The birthday...  Was he in the cut there?  No, he wasn't in the cut at that moment.  I thought I heard someone from the cut.  Sounded like he might have been in the cut.  No, I think they were just playing Beds at that point, and then DJ Laz maybe at 9 o'clock 
[01:57:30]  would come on and do an hour of spinning, mixing.  So, in other words, the music you heard turning up in the background was the gate limiter  on the tape, the fucking recorder.  Sloppy board work.  Sloppy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Where are the welfare bitches at?  They call this show.  I don't know if the welfare bitches...  Not that I heard.  They may.  Yeah, it sounds...  I bet the PD tells them, don't put no ghetto rats on the fucking phones.  Put no welfare bitches.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't want ghetto rats.  We want to be classy. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Uh, we're almost done with today's Jocktober with DJ Laz in Africa from Miami.  Yeah.  A lot of people are very happy we're, uh, looking at this show today, by the way.  How's it going?  This was a...  A lot of fans of Miami.  This was another fan request.  Oh.  Well, we're taking fan requests this year, right?  Oh, yes.  Another prank call segment, Anthony.  This one might sound familiar.  Oh.  Yes.  They, uh...  Uh-oh.  ...have a friend...  Yeah.  ...who's obviously in studio with them...  Uh-huh.  ...do the call for them.  Um, a character who is exclusive to their show, I'm sure, who you guys didn't hear on 
[01:58:30]  multiple shows last year.  Oh, no.  No.  There's no...  No.  We're not doing...  I told you we're not doing fugitive stuff.  Not fugitive.  Oh.  Whoa.  You sure?  No.  I thought it was...  No, no, no.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy's writing again.  I thought...  It can't be good.  All right. 
[01:59:00]  Here we go.  This, I mean, you may not even remember right now, but hopefully once you hear the voice,  you will.  Because not only...  Because last year, this performer was also featured on another show.  Oh, uh...  Then we did a day of all different shows featuring this performer in studio.  As it turns out, this performer is right there with DJ Laz in Africa.  Bill Tetley?  Oh, I forgot the name of the broad.  Well...  It's a broad, and she syndicates her stupid character. 
[01:59:30]  Is that a woman who does that?  I think so.  Well, let's listen.  Crank calls from Carmen.  Carmen!  That's right.  I fucking hate it.  Crank calls from Carmen.  Carmen's in almost every market in America.  Ah, yeah.  Is she really?  And they all make believe she's exclusive to that particular radio show.  To that station, yeah.  And that show, yeah.  Because what happens...  She's a genius.  Oh, yeah.  What happens, you get a good character voice, and then you go to every fucking market and  go, look, I'll only do it for your station. 
[02:00:00]  Now, do you say that in the market?  In the market.  Yeah, no overlapping fields of fire on the signal.  Larry, the cable guy, did this.  Right.  Right.  He would call stations every day.  And people thought he was just on that one radio station.  So if you really like Carmen, then just Google it and put your hometown in.  For instance, people in New York would want to listen to Hot 97.  Now, Hot 97 has Carmen's crank call thing.  Why don't we get Carmen?  How do you personalize?  Do they personalize it? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I think you have to hire, pay for the service.  Oh, and she will personalize it for your show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's great.  Listen to how horrible this is, but there's stations all over the country buying into it.  Wow.  Crane calls from Carmen.  Hello?  Hello?  Hola, this is Carmen.  Shut up.  What?  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Laz is going to be so mad that he missed this Carmen.  She's calling to ask about swimming lessons for her husband. 
[02:01:00]  It's funny.  Listen.  Hello?  Hola, my name is Carmen.  Hello.  I'm calling about swim lessons.  I was told that you give them.  That's correct.  My husband doesn't know how to swim.  Okay.  His name is Alejandro.  Okay.  I want to get him surprise swim lessons, but the swim lessons aren't the surprise.  The surprise is I want you to, like, take him into the deep end of the swimming pool,  and then I'm going to come out of the shower room, and I'm going to say, surprise, I know 
[02:01:30]  you've been cheating on me, and you're going to be cheated of oxygen, and then you're going  to swim away from him and leave him to drown.  I'm sorry, what?  You're going to swim away from him and leave him to drown.  You're asking me to let somebody drown?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We're not going to let him drown, like, completely, but I want him to, like, be scared and, like,  you know, splash around and be like, I can't breathe, I can't breathe.  Go, go. 
[02:02:00]  I do that for William Shatner.  It just makes you angry, though.  It's terrible.  I couldn't.  You get angry.  I got, like, all douchey chilled.  Because we're connected to this shit.  You know what I mean?  It's horrible.  That fucking idiot, whoever's doing that, is making money.  Yeah.  Doing that.  A lot.  There are a lot of stations.  Easily a couple hundred thousand a year.  Easily.  What the fuck is that about? 
[02:02:30]  No, I can't do that.  I'm sorry.  And then when he's about to slip out of consciousness, then you go in there with your swimming abilities  and save him.  Man, I couldn't even, you know, you can't be taking chances like that in a situation like  No, I trust you.  I can't just guarantee I can swim away from him for a minute and scare him and then come  back and save him.  I trust you.  You sound very trustworthy over the phone.  Then I'm going to prison because I let a guy drown in the pool while I swim in the 
[02:03:00]  That's why we can't let him die.  You know what I mean?  Because we don't want you going to prison in your speedo.  I know someone's laughing.  Oh, hello?  Oh, Carmen.  You going to call that Carmen?  Hola, my name is Skyriman.  I believe we were disconnected.  You're crazy.  You've got to be...  Listen, Papacito, it's not like we're going to let him drown. 
[02:03:30]  I'll bring protection.  Bring protection?  A condom.  Oh, yeah, that'll stop him from drowning.  And I'll let you play with my flotation devices.  All right.  In fact, you'll be in your speedo.  I'll be in a life jacket.  Hello?  Huh?  Crane calls from Carmen.  What?  Please, hello?  Weekday mornings on the DJ Live's Morning Show.  30 past every hour on Miami's party station.  Power 96.  30 past every hour?  Yeah.  Every hour they do one of those?  Yes. 
[02:04:00]  Holy shit.  Radio deserves everything that is happening to it.  Everything.  Everything.  Every hour it's another Carmen call.  Holy fuck.  I'm so annoyed.  That's why I don't like doing Jocktober.  I get excited every year and then I get really fucking pissed off.  That's why it took two days.  I knew it.  I knew it would be this week.  And you did say that we usually are psyched about it.  And then within like a week we start getting...  Two days.  And you guys forget that you guys get mad.  We do forget that we get pissed off at this. 
[02:04:30]  Because we're connected to this.  Hello?  Yeah.  We're in a horrible business.  And then eventually...  Who buys this shit?  You want to just burn Jocktober and all of radio to the ground.  Oh.  But if you're...  You know?  If you're talented enough to do radio, why can't you do your own prank calls?  Or come up with your own character?  Hello, Sam.  How are you?  Look, I would like you to actually, um...  Could you get a gun?  And when you're doing the shit show, blow your fucking braise out? 
[02:05:00]  Whoa, whoa.  Carmen.  I let you touch my flotation devices.  Jesus.  Carmen.  Dramatic dial tone.  What a bunch of fucking crap.  Uh, we got someone calling in, Ant.  What?  Yeah.  We got someone calling in here.  Let me, uh, see who this is.  Hello?  Who's this?  Hi.  This is the serious sexist fugit chip. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, the fugitive.  No.  The fugit chip.  Chip.  Oh, fugit chip.  Fugit chip.  Well, I guess we're probably supposed to figure out where you are so a lucky listener can find you.  Yeah.  I stole the rules from the boss's office.  The rules?  The rules?  Makes no sense.  No, fugit chip, that doesn't make sense.  You should have, uh, maybe stolen some ticket.  What?  I don't have tickets.  I was trying to get them, so I stole the rules from the boss's office, and now you can 
[02:06:00]  just look up and see the sky.  Oh!  Fugit chip.  I know who the fugit chip is.  I think I know, too.  Are you going to get the roof back, or?  Yeah, but I'm going to give clues or something.  Yeah?  Oh.  Yeah.  I got the roof.  It's in my pocket.  And I'm going to call up exactly this time, in three years, and give the...  Three years?  You're really hoping for that TSL. 
[02:06:30]  Three years.  Man, those PPMs must be a bitch.  I'm going to call back in three years and give the second clue as to where the roof is.  It'll be in my pocket, but where I am.  It's going to rain before then.  The office is going to get so wet.  Yeah, you're going to ruin the office, and I guess they would just put a new roof on the  boss's office.  For sure.  They can't wait three years for the roof to come back.  That'd be really funny if there was a cleaning crew in there, and it started raining, and  he was touching the electrical outlets, and they got shocked and died.  That would be a hoot.  Yes.  My dog got killed like that one time. 
[02:07:00]  There were some wires, and he stepped on them.  His name was Patty.  I'm sorry to hear about that.  Yeah, that's a shame.  Wow.  So we got to wait three years for the first clue.  But I want the first clue.  Yeah, what would the first clue be if it was three years in the future?  I can't say.  I'm standing here, and there's a tree.  Click.  We would have to wait three years for that?  Click.  Right. 
[02:07:30]  And then I hang up, and I call back in another three years.  Three years.  I tell you, like, dogs are barking.  If you just bark on a tree and stuff, it'll be good.  We could kind of stretch this one out for a little while.  A little while, huh?  Sometimes you wish that you would have improvised a funnier dog name, but Patty just came up  and didn't see it.  Well, that's the comedy we expect from Chip.  Fugit Chip.  Yes.  I didn't change my voice.  I forgot to or something.  Well, change your voice.  My mother lays on the floor, and they put their giant, dark weapons inside of her. 
[02:08:00]  Is that a clue?  Yes.  I'm in the bushes.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why usually I'm in a tap.  Yeah.  In the bushes.  I watch my mother take their seed.  And you have the roof from the boss's office, and in three years, we'll get another clue.  What's that?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Just sometimes you should probably write down more than just the idea. 
[02:08:30]  I realize things start going south pretty quick, you know?  Well, I can ask you this.  How long will this bit take?  Like, I know when regular radio does it with the fugitive, it's about a month.  No, but this one's probably about 15 years.  A 15-year bit.  Yeah, I started another one like nine years ago.  I'm on a third clue already.  The first one was the tree, and the next one was the barking, and the other one was my shoes got leather.  Those are vague clues. 
[02:09:00]  I think this might take a while.  Yeah.  I guess I'm running out of steam.  This bit's starting to feel like it's taking three years.  Oh, yeah, it sure is.  Oh, bless you, Chip.  Bless you.  I'll have my pumpkin spice latte or something.  All right.  Oh, those are delicious.  There's Fugitive Chip.  We're going to have to wait three years for the next clue.  Thank you, Fugitive Chip.  Fugitive Chip.  Well, was that all for the DJ Laz and Africa show? 
[02:09:30]  That's all for today.  I'm sorry to say.  And again, you proved your point.  Two days, and we were fucking angry.  And I hope he said yesterday that hip-hop radio keeps it real.  Well, they keep it real shitty.  Yeah, it's too bad.  I think I'd have written some stuff down first.  Come on, roof is great.  Roof is great.  Stupid roof of the boat.  Mick Foley's here?  Yes, he's here.  Oh, he is.  We'll talk to him next. 
[02:10:00]  His announcement is already late.  Really?  He said, I'll make an announcement at 8.23 a.m. tomorrow.  Is he coming out?  It's 8.28.  Oh, so he's a little late with the announcement.  We'll get the announcement from Mick Foley next.  It's a big announcement.  Jamie Oliver.  Jamie Oliver's what, a chef or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I believe Danny recut some audio.  What happened?  From Jamie Oliver.  Nice.  Yeah.  Jocktober will continue tomorrow.  With who?  I can't tell you, but... 
[02:10:30]  We might not make it until Friday.  I'm trying to...  If everything goes according to plan, I'm hoping to highlight a Jocktober classic tomorrow  instead of a new recruit.  Oh, oh.  John and Jeff?  I'm not going to tell you who it is.  Scott and Todd?  I refuse to tell you who it is.  Because I want the element of surprise to be there.  Fair enough.  Jamie Oliver said some weird shit.  Check this out.  Hi, guys.  Welcome to the Ministry of Food.  I've got a bit of a bonus, but it's not hard.  It's just over a centimeter thick, so it's not wobbling. 
[02:11:00]  Lovely.  And you're going to rub it backwards and forwards again and again and again.  And, you know, not that there's a rush, but, you know, you need a sense of urgency.  You can't just sit there sort of poking it around, okay?  So keep it moving.  We don't want it to be wobbly.  So just keep tossing it off.  There's no point in getting scared now.  Rub it all over.  Be careful.  Don't slap it all over the place.  You're going to get in trouble.  Now, the question is, how do you like your balls?  Personally, I quite enjoy little balls. 
[02:11:30]  I've got a little knob that all my mates absolutely love.  But what I want to show you is these balls here, and there's nothing wrong with them, but they're not quite as attractive.  So it's always worth having a little nibble.  Okay.  Now, second important bit.  I'm going to get my cucumber here.  I'm going to put it full whack into your burger again and again and again.  And then we can have a little look inside it.  And then I'm going to put it in your mouth.  Some people love it.  Some people hate it. 
[02:12:00]  Give it a try.  Don't turn your nose up on it.  If you don't like it, you can take it out, which I think is nice and reasonable.  But, I mean, you know, let's not be precious.  Because it doesn't really matter what it looks like.  What does matter is that when you go and eat it, you don't get a massive chunk of cheese.  Some people don't like it.  Some people love it because they're used to it.  There's no point in worrying about it.  Just stick it in there and do the best job possible until it's bone dry.  And it all goes down the same hole.  All right, I'm going to go straight in.  I'm going to go in. 
[02:12:30]  I'm just going to literally go straight in again and again and again.  Just to give it that creaminess, that little sticky, shining sauce is obviously an acquired taste.  I love it.  But in the past, people have said, oh, it's sort of sticky and gluey.  It will not be in two minutes when you're eating it.  So what you've got to do is duck and dive, get a big mouthful of cream.  And that's going to be delicious.  It just tastes and smells completely different than anything you've had before, right?  And there's no point in wasting it.  I'm really happy with this.  It's dead cool, dead exciting. 
[02:13:00]  I love it.  It's brilliant.  It's really, really nice.  It's a winner.  Quick, quick, quick.  I'm literally going to cream.  Absolutely, you want to be tasting it.  And then all I've literally got to do is jiggle it about right at the end.  You're knackered.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  Well chuffed.  Brilliant.  Pope's your uncle.  Joke done.  Nice one.

[02:13:30]  Oh, man, I'm happy.  We got Mick Foley in studio.  Yes.  We love Mick Foley.  You've been doing our show for, I don't even know, over 10 years at this point.  Many, many years.  We once met on a train coming into the city.  I know.  I say it every fucking time.  When I saw your hometown, I saw it.  I thought to myself, actually, I said it to my son.  Yeah.  He's like, who?  Come on.  You know, he's not cool yet.  He's not cool.  So he doesn't know yet.  But the best part is, I'm on a train. 
[02:14:00]  Mick Foley's on a train.  I'm thinking to myself, I deserve to be on a train, but he doesn't deserve to be on a train.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just me and you in the car, too.  It was, man.  Yeah.  It was like, you were coming in to do the afternoon show, right?  So I got empty trains, man.  It was nice.  And I get on, and there's Mick Foley.  I'm like, what?  And he was massively huge with the wrestling.  Well, I believe it was the cheaper option.  You were champion at the time, I'm being reminded.  So the champion, who's got the belt for the WWF, it was called at the time, is on the Long 
[02:14:30]  Island Railroad.  I wonder who reminded you.  E-Rock.  Of course he did.  Did I have the belt on my shoulder?  That would have been good on the train, belt on your shoulder.  You were writing.  Yeah.  You were writing your first novel at the time.  Hey, really quick, Duff McKagan's on CNN.  Aren't we supposed to get him in?  I would love it.  I'm talking to him on the phone yard.  I hope we have him.  You said yes to him.  Is he coming in?  I don't know.  Wouldn't today be the day?  No, it would be, I'm talking to him tomorrow.  Oh, so maybe he's on tomorrow. 
[02:15:00]  Sorry, Mick Foley.  I hope so.  His book is amazing.  Yeah, he's a cool guy.  He's from Guns N' Roses.  You like the Guns N' Roses?  Yeah.  Is he the guy I just saw on Celebrity Rehab?  Oh, fuck.  Help me out.  Yeah, Stephen Adler, right.  Who's been on our show.  Yeah, Stephen Adler.  Does Duff, who's a financial guru, mind being confused for the guy on Celebrity Rehab?  I know, right?  He's like a financial guy.  Yeah, because Duff is living a healthy life right now.  Yeah.  And Stephen Adler's still struggling.  But what a great guy.  Is he back to struggling or no?  Well, he went on the Celebrity Rehab. 
[02:15:30]  So what was that about?  Because I stopped watching Celebrity Rehab.  Is he on the dope?  Just, you know what?  They busted him.  He was, you know, marijuana, which doesn't really count.  I thought Dr. Drew was being a little...  A little rough?  A little rough.  You've got to allow the marijuana, right?  You're in a rock and roll band.  How are you not going to allow that?  I don't think they...  I think it's pretty much everything's got to go.  In Dr. Drew's world?  Yeah.  It fully makes a good point.  A little marijuana if you're in a rock band?  Who's looking? 
[02:16:00]  How do you go completely without it?  Right.  Who's looking?  People used to look at me in 1990 when I joined WCW for the first time, and word got around  that I didn't smoke.  Like, it wasn't the stuff I did in the ring and all the wild things that made me seem  odd.  It was like, something's wrong with this guy.  And I would turn it down, you know?  Hey, hey, you know, you want to have a little smell good?  No.  I'm not saying guys use it now, 20 years later, but that was kind of the drug of choice.  And I'd check into my hotel, you know, I'd have like three guys in the Econolodge, and 
[02:16:30]  I would see certain wrestlers, there'd be like cumulus clouds of smoke drifting up.  It's like Snoop Dogg's trailer or something.  From the door?  You've got to put the towel down.  They didn't always know, man.  They didn't always know.  Just take the edge off from the day?  What is it?  That's the report.  Yeah, I take it to the greatest stress.  Made life on the road a little bit easier.  Yeah, that is kind of weird, because you were the oddest wrestler in your peer group, but  they looked at you like you were odd because you didn't smoke.  Yeah, and here's an odder thing, right? 
[02:17:00]  Clinton, he tried it, but he didn't inhale.  Yeah.  No, I've never tried it, but due to the fact that I've driven in cars that had great clouds  of it, I've probably inhaled.  You've probably inhaled at some point, yeah.  Isn't that stupid that Clinton said that and we all had to just buy into that?  Like, how do you try something without inhaling?  And then after you blow the smoke out that you didn't put in your lungs, you're now breathing  it in anyway.  I think he was fibbing.  Well, obviously, but no one calls him out on it. 
[02:17:30]  They go, oh, okay, that sounds logical.  You call him out on it now.  Now you got Obama, you know, fessing up the coke.  No.  Back in his day.  Well, it was like in his book.  Yeah.  His book, he talks about that.  I've read his book, Anthony.  Yeah?  He copped a reefer.  He copped a reefer?  He didn't cop to doing a little cocaine back in the day?  No, you're thinking of the last president.  Oh, right.  And your president's mixed up.  George W.  George W.  George W.  He said he might have done a little.  He didn't cop to it, but that was the rumor. 
[02:18:00]  A little of the nose can.  Ah, ah.  There's no Obama cocaine rumor?  I don't believe so.  Although he does look kind of thin.  Yeah.  He'd whip something up here.  Keep that boyish figure somehow.  He's a bit stressed.  Look at me.  I got a mic in front of me.  I'm just blurting out allegations.  Eh, whatever.  This is the first time I've come on him and thought to myself, this isn't going very well.  It's going well?  It's going well?  Calm down, man.  This is fine.  I don't know what's on the phone here.  No, no.  I'm enjoying it very much. 
[02:18:30]  He only goes on his phone when he's bored.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So don't worry about it.  Nah.  I need some feedback.  We got some air.  I need somebody in the field of humor to acknowledge what I'm saying.  Paul, you're a little paranoid.  Maybe you're on the dope, sir, because this is going quite well, and you've got the big  announcement in your back pocket that you can pull out any time when you feel like this  isn't going well.  I apologize to me, because I know how it is when you're in a radio.  It does look worse than it is, because we do it all day.  We really do that.  Do you remember when Vince McMahon had that interview?  How do you spell snooze? 
[02:19:00]  I'm kidding.  I'm sitting right next to a snooze fest tweet.  It didn't go particularly well on HBO Real Sports.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, when he leaned in and said, let me tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't the one with Bob Costas.  It was the one with Armin Kataean.  I don't know.  And I asked Arn, you would know who he is.  He's kind of like that annoying, you know, I'm better than you type of vibe guy.  And Vince, when I asked him about it, he got hot.  Like, it brought back a bad mood.  He goes, let me tell you what that was like. 
[02:19:30]  Go ahead, ask me a question.  Ask me a question.  And I go and ask Vince a question.  He has papers.  He starts ruffling them and looking at the papers.  So the guy wasn't paying attention to Vince's answers.  And then, you know, act surprised when Vince gets angry.  Because Vince is a guy who's used to getting 100% undivided attention.  Oh, we got it.  Sam's got it, man.  Can you find that part?  We're obsessing.  Do you still hate Vince McMahon?  I've never hated Vince McMahon.  Ah, bleeding.  No. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, you did it.  Look at your hands.  Looks like a Smurf came on you.  You.  I just jerked off a Smurf.  You fiddled with that pen until it blew up in your hand, didn't you?  Yes.  I do that when interviews aren't going well.  Oh, fuck.  Come on.  I wonder why that pen yelled, I'll lock bar.  I can't occupy myself when I'm feeling a little nervous about an interview. 
[02:20:30]  No, I guess, for the record, you don't hate Vince McMahon.  No, I never hated him.  And the thing is, as it becomes more and more obvious, I'm heading back there.  I like him more and more.  Are you going back there?  Probably, yeah.  Is that what the big announcement is?  No.  It's arguably bigger than that.  Wow.  Let me just spill it.  Well, we want to listen to this HBO.  Do we have this segment queued up there, Samuel?  Young Sam.  This is what Vince is referring to, HBO.  I mean, Mick Foley is referring to Vince on HBO.  No, of course, when they cut away to Armin, they're not going to show him fiddling with 
[02:21:00]  the papers.  But I could see how that would annoy a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Look, I got upset that Jim was looking at his phone.  Right.  I forget how rude that looks, because I am listening to everything you're saying.  But I forget sometimes that, like, oh, yeah, we are on a live interview.  It does look rude.  Yeah, I didn't mean to.  I love that.  We just do it all the time.  Now it looks like I had too much mercury.  How do I get this out of my hand?  Yeah.  If you had too much mercury, there'd be a problem with your asshole.  Can I catch Freddy? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, ouch.  All right, let's listen to this.  Okay, here we go.  Again, most of us, the smart ones, obviously, grew up and grew out of those habits.  But certainly in all the entertainment business, it was the Wild West.  A lot of individuals, unfortunately, passed away as a result of that.  We asked McMahon about a few of the biggest names in the business who worked for his and  other organizations.  Do you have a reason why these people would be dying under the age of 45? 
[02:22:00]  Why don't you ask yourself that question?  I mean, why are you indicating that's my responsibility, these people are dead?  Because I'm asking you if it's in any way, shape, or form falls on your shoulders.  I would accept no responsibility whatsoever for their untimely deaths.  None whatsoever.  As far as, and you've got that little look on your face like, jeez, Vince, how can you  possibly say that?  Well, but none whatsoever.  I mean, they wrestled for you.  By the way, that's part of your organization.  I won't be coming back after you guys hear this.  Oh, that's true.  That's true. 
[02:22:30]  I think we're blowing up your spot here.  Bring up the dark days.  Well, you know what, though?  I mean, Vince has a point on it.  He's not making anybody do anything.  Yeah.  And what was the part?  Was that the part, though?  Well, you can't really see where, because they're not going to show him shuffling his  papers.  We don't want to fuck him next year.  No, we're not.  Oh, man.  What a buzz killer.  But I'll see Vince get mad at the guy for the paper shuffle.  I definitely want to see this.  You won't see him.  He gets...  Because during an interview, you have to...  I mean, this guy was probably looking at questions.  You have to look at...  Because your answers are for the audience watching, not just the interviewer. 
[02:23:00]  Right.  The interviewer has to have questions.  I get that.  I mean, have you been in a situation where somebody, obviously, you know, I'm in it  right now, where the guy I'm talking to doesn't care.  It's not true.  But if somebody's the four guys you're talking to, they don't...  I'm kidding.  I really am kidding.  Oh, my God.  I love Mick Foley.  We do love you.  Of course.  Holy shit.  You're pretty open about some weird shit.  And Mick is a very good dude.  I want to see the...  Because I just want to see Vince's face. 
[02:23:30]  Well, are we going to fuck up Mick Foley?  Mick Foley has nothing to do with this.  This is the dark days from 2004.  Because, you know, if Vince takes no responsibility, then I'm not taking any...  Then you're not.  No.  No.  And, well, you shouldn't.  None whatsoever.  Just like Vince.  Part of your organization, they've worked a couple of hundred nights a year for you.  They live this lifestyle.  Oh, oh, Vince.  You can't believe...  Can you see that look?  I mean, oh, how can you possibly say that, Vince?  How can you look that way?  And you're giving me the old sympathetic stuff?  No, I'm not.  I'm honestly curious.  Because I told you, these individuals worked for our organization at one time. 
[02:24:00]  They also worked for other organizations.  I'm not responsible for the way the business was then.  I wasn't responsible for the way the business, how they grew up in the business, and whatever  personal bad habits they developed.  Why am I responsible for that?  I gave them the opportunity.  Well, you ran it.  I ran one organization.  You controlled the biggest organization.  I don't think we were the biggest at that time, quite frankly.  Okay, we're the sole surviving organization now. 
[02:24:30]  But as far as looking back on all of this, these individuals developed a lot of bad habits.  That's not my responsibility.  Sir?  He's totally right.  He is right.  Here's why I don't like that reporter.  Why didn't he address the fact that Vince hit his paper?  What are you doing?  Because he was scared shitless.  When Vince is leaning over looking at you with that face like he's pissed and you just  smacked your papers, all you're thinking is, the next thing is, he's going to punch me  in the face.  I have a feeling Mick has seen that look a few times over the years. 
[02:25:00]  Is Vince ever intimidated by wrestlers?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Vince can handle himself.  He's a big boy.  Have you ever seen him back down to a wrestler?  No, he enjoys the confrontation.  Honestly, when I went in and when I started having serious disagreements with Vince, I  came out of that situation or multiple situations feeling like I could do anything. 
[02:25:30]  I could talk to anybody about foreign policy.  Oh, really?  He's a billionaire and he's a big guy and he's larger than life.  And you had your little victory.  Sometimes I did.  I felt victorious.  You felt good about yourself?  You know, there was just, you know, you guys haven't heard me curse once in a while.  No, that's true.  Once in a while.  Jim Ross, he still tells a story about the time he handed me my royalty check for Have  a Nice Day, which was, you know, just, it was big. 
[02:26:00]  It was real big.  But I didn't know that there was an agent who had brokered the deal for WWE when I saw  Minus Agents Fees.  I thought, I don't have an agent.  So it was about 20% light, which was a couple hundred grand light at that point.  Wow.  And what should have been the greatest moment in my life.  And here's Jim Ross handing me a check for close to seven figures.  Yeah, yeah.  And I said, it was like my whole boat.  It was coming in and I see it and I just, I just lost it.  And I started dropping F-bombs and throwing furniture around the office. 
[02:26:30]  Like it was all, and I had this thing, I guess maybe I was getting kind of paranoid because  they probably wouldn't exercise their right to breach my contract if I missed like one  show, but they had it in my contract that if I breached for any reason that I wasn't  owed the royalties.  So I was actually like sweating and my perspiration was, I was smelling, you know, like I smelled  like sour milk.  I was so tense with this, with this check about to come in. 
[02:27:00]  And then when I got it, it wasn't what I was expecting.  I just, it was like this emotional outpouring in Jim Ross's office.  And he was just sitting there going, please, Mick, don't do this.  Were you right?  Or did you, like, how did they take an agency fee from you?  Well, it was, they were, there was an agent who brokered the deal on WWE's behalf.  They didn't, I had no idea at the time, you know, my book went first and I was like  the guinea pig because then it was Rock and then it was Austin.  And clearly I was like the number three out of those three guys. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, shit.  Let Mick go first so it doesn't work out well.  You know, he'll take the brunt of it.  And then the thing just exploded.  So nobody had thought, well, we don't have a good deal, you know, publishing deal.  And, and, and I had no idea that they had an agent.  I didn't know the language.  I was working out my own deals at that time.  Now, you know, luckily I've, I've had somebody for the past 10 years and that makes life so much  easier.  You just say, Hey, the percentage is worth it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The percentage is definitely worth it.  Yeah.  Wow.  I guess, man, I was, I was heated. 
[02:28:00]  So I actually, I called the guy I'd start, I had already started working with.  I was like, ah, I think I just quit WWE.  I told him I wasn't coming to TV.  The last time I'd quit was when Brett Hart got screwed in Montreal and I, and I didn't  come, I didn't come back.  Um, and that same night, Jim Ross left, like he talked to me for about two hours trying to  talk me into coming back at the time that, uh, that Brad had gotten, you know, about this  Montreal thing with the belt, right? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  He was supposed to be the champion of his hometown and Vince screwed him over last minute with,  uh, Sean Michael.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They rang the bell.  And is that the famous Brett Michaels punching Vince behind closed doors?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brett Michaels or Sean?  Yeah.  Sean, Sean Michaels.  Uh, uh, Brett Hart.  Sorry.  Brett Michaels got a shot at him.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Poison was playing at the.  Brett Hart.  Right.  Brett Hart.  Uh, he was supposed to win the belt in his home, you know, in his home country.  He was supposed to keep maintaining the belt.  Maintain it.  Okay.  And then, uh, when Sean Michaels maneuvered Brett into his own submission hole, the sharpshooter. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  I'm sure Errol will appreciate me bringing it up.  Hey, you know what?  He should be.  He still sells shirts with, uh, referee stripes that says, damn right.  I did it.  You know?  So he's marketing this still 14 years after the fact.  Uh, but we, we were standing in the back of the, the Molson center or whatever it is,  just shocked.  And there was like five or six of us going, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not showing up to work  tomorrow.  Wow.  And then I sat in my hotel room and I watched those other five guys as they all showed up  for work. 
[02:29:30]  And I was like, I'm the last one.  And I just signed a contract extension.  It was like a five year deal.  And then I was talking to my wife.  I was like, yeah, you know, um, I don't think I'm able to make a dime for the next five years.  Yeah.  I don't think I'm allowed.  I think I'll show up and see, you know?  So it was my one day, my one day walkout.  And I will say that was the most loved I ever felt up to that point by Vince, because I  didn't know that he'd taken the shot from Brett. 
[02:30:00]  Um, and you know, it, it dazed him.  Brett caught him with a pretty good shot.  Oh man.  Oh, he really hit him.  Oh yeah.  You know, the story is, and I guess, I hope Vince doesn't mind me saying it is, you know,  Brett was really upset and, uh, and Vince, uh, Brett would like to talk to you.  And, and Brett said, Vince, he says, I'm taking a shower.  I want to be left alone.  If you're still here, when I get back, I'm going to punch you right in the effing face.  Yeah.  And, and, you know, Vince, you know, he, he, he took the shot, you know, he knew it was  coming.  Brett had a towel on, you know, he came over, boom. 
[02:30:30]  And, you know, and really, uh, laid one.  I mean, the next day when I saw Vince or two days later, you know, his face was all swollen  up.  Uh, and I had to talk with J.R.  And, uh, or actually I told J.R.  Then I called my wife and told her I quit.  And when I caught, when I, when I hung up the phone, I saw the light was flashing and it  was, uh, Mick, this is, uh, Vince McMahon, uh, I'd like to talk to you.  And I was like, Oh, after finding out what had gone on, I thought he thought enough of  me to call after this whole incident with the punching. 
[02:31:00]  So, uh, very, very loved.  Did Brett get thrown out of wrestling for that?  He left, uh, for WCW after that.  And, uh, and he and, uh, Vince, you know, they didn't talk for many, many years, but now  it's like water under the bridge.  Oh, they do talk to him.  Yeah, there's that one, Brett's been back on the show several times.  There's that one shot, a shot of him walking out of the room right after it happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Vince is like, wobbly, like he took a fucking punch, man. 
[02:31:30]  No, it's not on mine.  Oh, they took it offline?  It used to be on there.  Yeah, I know the scene.  Now they're selling it, right?  Yeah, it's from the DVD.  Can you see the punch or that's not?  No, the punch is behind closed doors.  Yeah, but you see Vince walk out of the room and his, he's fucking like just wobbly and  yeah, that was a, that was a hell of a, that was some drama.  You going back there?  That's, uh, the rumor, rumor is, uh, rumor.  I started that rumor and it's gotten around.  And you're hoping that they go with it.  Are you starting your own rumors, Stan? 
[02:32:00]  I love it.  I go on every Monday night, you have the largest Twitter audience.  Yeah, and I realized that I can't joke around because the last time I sent out, it was  a tweet that really cost me my job with TNA.  Granted, I had offered my release because I just, I'd really lost faith in the product,  you know?  And I was like, you know, in the old days when one of those guys like Bill Watt, you know,  with the name Cowboy Bill Watts, they would walk in and say, if someone's not happy, Bill  doesn't sound like Vince, I just go with my authority.  Yeah, like the boss voice.  My authority figure voice. 
[02:32:30]  But he would say, if you don't like the way I'm running things, get the hell out.  And so I told, you know, TNA, I said, I'd be that guy that was getting up and getting  the hell out.  But when we decided we were going to work together and do the best we could, I thought, okay,  this is cool, at least until my contract expires in September.  And then I got home after like a 400-mile ride.  I was a little, you know, upset with the way things were going.  And The Rock had responded for the first time to my name on his Twitter account.  This is where Twitter gets you in trouble.  And people have been asking about our I Quit match, which was that brutal match from Beyond 
[02:33:00]  the Mat, where my kids are watching and crying.  And The Rock's response was, yeah, I hit Mick Foley 12 times.  He bled.  I won.  And I was like, that's not really a very sentimental first tweet.  So my response was, maybe so, but two days later, I pinned The Rock beneath, like I'm  actually doing the Twitter motion right now.  Yeah, see your thumbs.  Careful you don't get carpets home. 
[02:33:30]  I'll get it aside.  Looks like you still use a BlackBerry.  Yeah, I have got, yeah, I've got the little phone here.  Not a BlackBerry, but something along those lines.  I said, but I won it two days later when I pinned him beneath a pallet of beer kegs in an  empty arena match, a.k.a. a TNA house show.  Oh, shit.  And it was like, when word got around that I was openly comparing the attendance to a  problem, you know, purposely empty arena show to the attendance, you know, the company 
[02:34:00]  I worked for, it was like, that was the straw that broke the camera's back, you know.  Did he get the phone call immediately?  It was like a day later that my manager said, yeah, talk to their people.  I said, yeah, they don't want you there.  They don't really need you to come by anymore.  Were you sad?  You know what, at the time, I was sad that I couldn't have left doing something positive  for the company.  Like, even when I was on the outs with WWE when I was an announcer and I was leaving  on the way out, Edge, you know, Edge called me out and we did a great interview together 
[02:34:30]  and he ended up putting me through a table.  And it was the first time I'd ever actually left on a stretcher.  The Hell in a Cell match, I'd gone halfway up the aisle and then climbed off the stretcher.  But I left WWE on a stretcher and then afterwards I was elated because it was like really good TV.  You know, I want to do good TV.  You know, if I'm on stage, I want to do good comedy.  Like, I take pride in giving my all.  And I offered, I even said, you know, texted the powers that be.  I was like, hey, on my way out of WWE, I did some really good TV. 
[02:35:00]  Why don't we do the same thing?  And they just didn't see it that way.  Like, just, just, just leave.  Just go.  Just go away.  Just, uh.  Well, look at Sam found the clip of Vince.  Cool.  You want to hear Brett talking about it and then Vince walking around?  Yeah, a little bit.  But this is a moment that Vince dislikes the most.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I know.  Oh, wow.  Is it?  I'm going to, you know, I have an announcement.  I have a shocking announcement to make.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.  And it's not that I'm not going back to WWE because Sam queued up a. 
[02:35:30]  Why did he dislike this moment the most?  You know, because, look, Vince is a guy who blew out his quadricep, okay?  He blew out his quadricep and in attempting to, in attempting to cover up the fact that  he had blown out his quadricep, he blew out his other one.  Whereas any other human being would have stayed down, Vince, Vince tried to get up because  he didn't want anyone to see him not under his own power.  Uh-huh.  It's a, you know, it's a pride thing.  He's a tough guy.  Yeah, it's a very tough guy. 
[02:36:00]  So for Vince to be seen in a moment of weakness, now granted, he's put himself in ridiculously  weak moments on the air where he's paid his pants and he's done anything.  There was this moment where we're getting ready to go out for, for, for Raw.  It was always this hectic scene, you know, the fireworks are going off.  No one knows exactly what's going to happen.  We're just hoping that it's all going to come together, you know, remotely the way it's  been, you know, talking about.  Put on paper or whatever.  And then Vince goes to Jericho.  He goes, oh, Chris, remember when you get out there, don't, don't forget to call Stephanie 
[02:36:30]  a bottom feeding trash bag.  Jericho had all those things.  And I said, Vince, and he looked at me and he, I said, that's your daughter.  And he said, Mick, there's nothing I wouldn't do to get a pop in this business.  So he'd do anything on air, but off air, you know, that's not something.  I want to see it because I don't know the moment.  Oh, it's a great.  Don't play the sound.  The thing that's impressive about Vince is he didn't, he didn't get knocked out. 
[02:37:00]  No, he didn't.  The bottom line is a wrestler punched him in the face and he still walked out on his own  power.  That's what I'm saying.  Drilled him.  Yeah, there you go.  Fast forward to it.  You know what?  As hard as I could.  I don't know.  You knock those bits with them with a punch.  I told him to get out.  I can't out.  For the record, he's under his own power there.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Under his own power.  He took the shot.  He didn't knock him out.  He may have knocked him down.  No, no.  Down, but not out.  So, 13 years, 14 years after the fact.  Now, I'm picking up for Vince.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No.  Vince loves the giant suit, by the way.  That's a giant suit.  Well, he's a giant guy.  I know, but it still looks bigger than it needs to be.  It's huge.  There's something going on there.  Look how giant his suit is.  That's a big fucking suit.  Well, but you're going to be back in WWE, huh? 
[02:38:00]  Well, you know, it's the rumor.  Until this day.  What are you going to be doing for them, you think?  It's going to be crazy not to.  I don't know yet.  Please don't wrestle anymore.  Please don't wrestle anymore.  Really?  I've done enough?  Yes, you've fucking proved yourself.  Take a couple of bumps.  Hey, can I make my shocking announcement?  I want to hear the shocking announcement.  I think I know what it is.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  Is it that I'm going to be at the Pittsburgh Improv on October 20th or 22nd?  Because Mick was saying, when are you going to be at the Pittsburgh Improv on October 20th or 22nd? 
[02:38:30]  I don't want to say that's your announcement.  I'm just wondering if that was it.  It was.  No, but can I open for you?  I would love you to.  Can I plead?  All I need is one guy to vouch for me.  If you guys watch the clips on realmickfoley.com, if you don't think it's good, just don't bring it up.  But look, here's the alternate karate.  This is Mr. Miyagi.  This is if Mr. Miyagi, instead of having odd cars that needed waxing and fences needed paintings, 
[02:39:00]  if he happened to have been running a seedy massage parlor, this is how Daniel...  Can you play just a little bit of it?  Yeah, sure.  You better fast forward to like 30 seconds.  I can't see.  40 seconds.  Sam, I can't see.  Here's how that might look.  I tried to recruit Ralph Macchio, but he said no way.  Here's my Ralph Macchio.  Hey, Mr. Miyagi, this is bullshit, man. 
[02:39:30]  I've been jerking guys off for six weeks.  Jesus, Mick.  You're blue.  I haven't learned nothing.  Daniel-san, everything.  Now, you say, hey, F you, man.  I'm out of it.  Daniel-san.  Look, eyes.  Look, eyes, Daniel-san. 
[02:40:00]  Daniel-san, show me.  Work the shaft.  Holy shit.  Mick's like...  See, you guys are laughing.  But he doesn't curse.  But he'll just work the shaft.  That's all right.  See, look at Daniel-san.  He's working a small shaft.  No, no, no.  What the shaft?  What the that?  No, no, Daniel-san.  This is not the Owl Snow. 
[02:40:30]  Show me big shaft.  Right hand stroke.  Work shaft.  Work shaft.  So he's learning the secrets of martial arts.  So he's learning the secrets of martial arts.  A karate through jerking men off.  I get it, Mick.  That's a good bit, Mick.  Governors.  Governors this weekend, right?  Yeah.  How great is it that you don't curse, but the sexual slavery is fodder for an eight-minute  bit.  Yeah, there's some racism in there. 
[02:41:00]  It's nice, Mick.  You might want to just say fuck.  Yeah.  Leave the other stuff alone.  You look good on stage, though.  You look comfortable.  Yeah, you're very comfortable.  It's like...  It's like a guy who knows how to work a mic.  Yeah.  It's obvious, yeah.  He proved that a long time ago.  And you're going to be at Governor's what?  Governor's on the 8th.  We're doing a big benefit show for Shane Helms, who's in a really bad motorcycle action.  I don't know if you guys reach into Charlotte.  That's on the 5th, and I'm just like a kid with a toy, because I have a new website, 
[02:41:30]  realmickfoley.com, so I just can now refer people, even if they're for people in the  UK, I can just close this up.  For everything.  Yeah, go to realmickfoley.com, yeah.  And look, we can go there.  Here's the shocking...  You ready for this revelation?  This is the announcement.  You guys are not going to believe it.  Here it is.  I am auctioning off my Medal of Reasonableness for Vermont flood victims.  Can you believe that?  Your Medal of Reasonableness?  But what's the real announcement that you came in for? 
[02:42:00]  You don't understand how big that is.  Is that big, Sam?  That would be like Kurt Angle auctioning off his gold medal to help Vermont flood victims.  Wait, what?  I knew you guys wouldn't believe it.  What was this medal about?  No, that's crazy.  I don't even know what the medal is about.  Iraq?  Do you know what it is, Iraq?  Look at that.  Jon Stewart handing me the Medal of Reasonableness in front of 250,000 people.  Oh, that was at that thing.  Wow, 250,000 people?  250,000.  That was my...  You're wearing the medal.  Exactly.  Oh, damn.  He knows that you're wearing it under your shirt. 
[02:42:30]  I thought if you guys want to take photos...  Look at this.  Medal of Reasonableness?  I'll give you 30 for it.  Damn.  Take a picture.  This thing's going to skyrocket now with Norton having that bad boy.  Now, this was given to you for what?  For acts of reasonableness everywhere but the workplace.  Oh, well, now it makes total sense.  That is true.  There we go.  I want a picture in the...  Could you snap a photo?  I sure will.  Look at Jimmy.  Do I?  Oh, he's a... 
[02:43:00]  The little thing in the bottom.  There we go.  Ready?  Medal of Reasonableness.  You're right.  Is this a big deal?  Bam.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I think we got it.  It's a pretty big deal.  It's from Jon Stewart's rally.  I mean, it was from everybody.  There's only four of those given out.  So it's more valuable than an Olympic gold medal.  I thought we were getting a big announcement today.  This is pretty big.  That's pretty big.  It's pretty big.  It's pretty big.  It's pretty big.  It's pretty big.  It's pretty big.  It's pretty big.  You can have the Medal of Reasonableness.  You can have it.  I told you to prepare to be disappointed.  You did right to me.  How much do you think you'd get for it, personally, and say that last night?  You know what? 
[02:43:30]  Here's the deal.  My son put it up last night, and we're starting this bad boy high, honestly.  This is not as big an auction as I did a few months ago for rain, which was like my  best stuff.  That was like the Cactus Jack boots and the Hell in a Cell shirt.  But we're putting up some pretty cool stuff.  We're up to almost two grand, and we're starting this at $4.99.  My son actually put a buy it now of $3,999, which might sound ridiculous,  but who knows what the market is on this?  Honestly, Jon Stewart, some of the people watching are affluent. 
[02:44:00]  There's only four of these bad boys out there.  Well, that's true.  So at $3,999, this may be a bargain.  Now, what is your Twitter?  Just Mick Foley?  At Real Mick Foley.  Real Mick Foley.  Yeah.  You need money for your mortgage?  It's gone to Vermont, Flood Vic.  I heard something else in there where he's selling all this shit.  I'm feeling bad for Mick Foley.  That's what I do, man.  I'm like Andy at the end of Toy Story 3.  I need to find a home for my stuff.  But if I can find a home for my stuff and help somebody, help people at the same time. 
[02:44:30]  It's a win-win.  What's like one of the, aside from the Medal of Reasonableness, of course,  what would you say the biggest thing that you have sold, that you owned, was the big item?  You know, I auctioned off my pride.  Your pride, dignity, whatever.  You know, the big one, we did this.  We raised over $20,000 for RAINN, which is the anti-sexual organization that I volunteer for.  And I was putting up my best stuff. 
[02:45:00]  It was the Cactus Jack boots.  They went for like $2,500.  Hell in a Cell shirt went for like $1,700.  We had a vacation package.  The impact was nice enough to do.  WWE's doing one here for Survivor Series.  And because that show sold out like in an hour, that we expect that to pick up.  So I think we're going to do pretty well.  I'm guessing we're going to do like $3,000 overall, and then whatever the medal brings in.  So we're looking to like...  Are you going to bid on this, Sam?  On the medal?  Get the ball rolling, brother.  Put it out there. 
[02:45:30]  I would like to bid on it.  You should write it off.  But I need to find some cash first.  You know what?  I'm going to give Sam the $500 needed to make this transaction.  And then you could...  And then you'll have no excuse whatsoever.  And then it's done.  I carry the type of money with me because I certainly don't spend it.  Sam, what about the look at the t-shirt money?  He's handing over money.  Call CNN.  It's $500 big ones, Sam.  I'm going to take it.  Go ahead, take it, and make the bid.  I'm doing it right now.  But what if the bid doesn't come in?  Then he has to give me the money back.  Here's the deal.  If Sam's the winning bid at $500, you guys have to... 
[02:46:00]  He has to wear the medal all week.  We'd love to do that.  He will anyway.  And you have to plug Grace Potter's larger benefit for Vermont flood victims.  See, it's Mick's a weird guy because Mick is...  Just dead.  Wonderful.  It works.  We joke about Mick being cheap, but he's a very giving guy.  Well, he is.  He just gave Sam $500 and Sam has to give it back.  My kids hit me with that all the time.  Dad, how come you don't give us any money to spend?  You don't give money to kids in Africa. 
[02:46:30]  It's like, Noel, someday you'll come to me and you'll tell me you understand.  Because I don't really have an answer for that.  Is it just something you feel compelled to do?  I do, man.  I have a giving problem.  You know?  That's why I never drink at a fundraiser.  Because I know that drinking and giving don't...  Oh, yeah.  Don't drink and give.  Yeah.  That's what I do at the casino.  I drink and give.  Yeah.  They actually have an IV with liquor hooked up to his fucking...  How's your child in Africa? 
[02:47:00]  Alamany?  Alamany.  He's doing good, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I get little letters from him.  Yeah.  Really?  And it's really him?  It's really him.  Yeah?  Are you sure it's him?  How's the village?  I visited the village.  No, I know.  We talked about it on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  The village...  I just want an update on Alamany.  Yeah, the Mick Foley School is going really well.  I got a letter that said from Alamany's mom that said that people stop him and thank  him for bringing...  What? 
[02:47:30]  I don't know the exact quote.  It's in my book.  Goodwill and blessings to the village.  Yeah.  You know, yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah, it's nice.  You got that going for you.  Yeah.  You know what?  You don't have to, like, hurl yourself off of cages to be appreciated.  All you got to do is give some money to people and get a school bill.  Yeah, yeah, that cash.  What kind of school is it, though?  It goes a long way.  Is it a hut?  It's not a hut, but it's not what we would think of.  It's a school.  It's not like a...  It's not a Harborfields high school, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have Joe Mayer coaching the boys' team there. 
[02:48:00]  There you go.  He from Long Island?  Yeah, Smithtown boy.  Oh, I didn't know him if he was from Long Island yet.  Yeah, I knew...  My high school played his high school.  Yeah, and I knew his coach pretty well.  Yeah, his daughter was super hot.  Did you know that?  No, because...  Yeah, she must have been just a little nothing back then, right?  Well, she was my age, you know.  How old are you?  46.  Okay.  Do you still live in Long Island?  I just moved back a couple weeks ago.  What?  Yeah, I was in Florida for a year.  I tried it, and I moved there with the understanding that most of my, you know, my impact wrestling dates would be at the Universal Studios. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  Oh.  And then when the Hulkster came in, and they didn't need a non-wrestling talking guy anymore, all of my dates started going, taking part, you know, in these remote areas of the country.  The day that I sent out that tweet to The Rock, I was up, I got pulled over by the Border Patrol in Messina, New York, for looking suspicious.  And I didn't have an answer as to where I was going, because I didn't know the name of the building. 
[02:49:00]  And people were actually passing the car going, Mick Foley!  Mick Foley!  Oh, shit!  And I was like, they know where I'm going, I don't know where I'm going.  Well, he looked suspicious.  And then I drove, like, the 400 back to the city, and so I was just kind of under, you know, feeling a little pressured when I got that tweet.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you get to where you had to go?  I did, yeah.  Oh, you did?  Wait, did you sell your house on Long Island?  We did, and then we just moved back a couple weeks ago.  To the same house?  No, to a different one.  You lost your cool house with the Christmas in the basement?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Who the fuck has the Mick Foley house?  His guy's name is Craig.  Is he a good guy?  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Tell him, give him.  His list is wonderful.  Tell him to give your house back.  Yeah, you can see him.  He's a salesman at Smithtown Nissan, so.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, you guys on the island can go over there, and if you want to check out my house, my old house.  So, did you move back to the same area?  Yeah, I'm like five minutes away.  The daughter's going to see you.  Wishing you were in your old house.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:50:00]  Drive past it all the time.  I'm like George Costanza, that episode of Seinfeld where he just starts doing the exact opposite of his instincts.  Right, right.  And things start working out for him.  Everything goes well.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you move your family to Florida?  Oh, of course I did.  Were they mad at you?  Well, I didn't know my daughter.  You see, my daughter very seldom drops.  I've never heard my daughter curse.  My son, different story.  But, you know, it was like last October, about a year ago, and my mom said, so how does Noelle like Florida?  I said, yeah, I think she likes it.  And my mom said, that's not what I heard.  Oh, no. 
[02:50:30]  And it was the Facebook thing with the sister-in-law going, I heard she hated it.  And then my mom leaned forward and said, she said she fucking hated it.  How old is she?  She's 17.  Yeah, man.  That's a tough age to move, man.  Tough age to move.  She's got everything said nice.  Yeah.  How happy is she to be back in Long Island?  She's happier.  She's extremely happy.  But her grades were so good in Florida that she could have gone to school for free, regardless of what the parents are making. 
[02:51:00]  They have that deal there.  And I'm like counting up how much it cost me.  And my wife and I had to talk.  We said, we're not going to crumble.  No matter what, we're going to tell her.  This is our home, and the moment those tears started coming down and streaming on her face, I heard myself saying, you can go back, honey.  All right, we're moving.  We'll work something out.  Dad, you fucked up.  How long are you in Florida?  One year.  One year.  Oh, okay.  One year.  What park?  Near Orlando?  Is that where it is?  Yeah, it was.  You know what?  Winter Park? 
[02:51:30]  Palm Coast.  Okay.  Palm Coast.  I don't know where that is.  It's up above Daytona.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  It's nice, but it wasn't like the island, you know.  You're back.  Yeah, yeah.  Back home.  Good time of year to come back, too.  You should have waited until fucking April.  What's the matter with you?  I know.  Come back in October.  Take advantage of the sunshine.  Yeah.  Come back in.  Yeah, you were there.  That was playing governors, though.  All right, so you're at least you're local.  That governor's a nice local gig for you.  October 8th.  Yeah.  Hey, when you were breaking in, right, were you just showing up places?  When?  Hoping for sets.  Yeah.  He still does it. 
[02:52:00]  Mick, he still does that.  Well, you know, Mick.  This is self-important guy who never gets asked a question, doesn't know how to handle the pressure.  Well, you know, Mick.  It's, you're in a position where you're very famous.  You'll probably be able to go on in most places.  I would just go and hang out.  And I would do, I did gigs in Jersey for years with guys like Bob Levy, Jim Florentine, and they would drink, so I would drive.  That's how it was, you know, because Bob's a drunk.  And I say that with love.  But you could probably stop into places. 
[02:52:30]  You'll be, I was going to say, you'll be a better comedian living here than you ever would in Florida.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there's so many good comics up here that you'll see, and there's so many places to work out material.  You'll get a thought and go like, fuck, that's something.  And you don't have to wait until a week from next Thursday to work it out.  You'll just go on stage three, four nights in a row, do ten-minute sets, and work out your piece.  Yeah, especially, you know, just showing up, the audience who are not there to see me, who are not wrestling fans, and you see what works and what doesn't.  And then you say, all right, maybe that story about Jake the Snake peeing on me in Canada, that's a wrestling audience. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  You know, that's a wrestling fan.  Dude, you're funny.  I mean, we've all known that for a long time.  You're fucking funny, man.  Or how do you make that Jake the Snake story?  But that's funny, though.  Or how do you make that translatable to everyone?  Because people watching you on TV won't all be wrestling fans.  So how do you take something and make it relatable?  You know what's really cool that I'm finding in comedy is the same thing that helped me out in wrestling, is that people who are in the business see that I really want to do better. 
[02:53:30]  And, you know, you look at somebody and they clearly want to improve or open to criticism and help.  And so on the one night I went out and I told that story, and I knew I told it another time and it got over really well.  And then it just didn't flunk, it didn't bomb, but the same lines that were getting the huge laughs in front of wrestling fans weren't getting laughs in front of this audience.  And Adam Ferrara was doing 45 minutes just unannounced because he hadn't done stand-up in three months and he was getting ready to headline that weekend. 
[02:54:00]  And he really, he said, hey, you know, don't get down.  You'll learn more out of a set like that than you would if you'd gone out and killed.  And he said, you know, if you're a storyteller, it's tough to go out as a big guy and just go into an eight-minute story.  Like, you know, you might want to pepper them with a couple of jabs, soften them up a little bit, and then you can get into your story.  So you find out, for me, you know, doing those five to ten-minute sets is much more difficult than going out there and putting in the time.  You know, I've found experience, Mick. 
[02:54:30]  Jimmy's holding a pipe for people that can't see this.  This guy who never gets to hold court.  You know, I'm holding court.  I want to know about Jake the Snake pissing on you.  Can I tell you, there's a feel-good story waiting to happen here.  There's a kid.  Sam is sick?  No.  Well, could you bring anything for Sam?  People want to know because I guess you promised Sam you would bring something.  I just gave him $500.  Yeah, exactly.  But he has to give it back.  No, that's only if he's, and here's my vow, all right? 
[02:55:00]  If we don't go over $500, if that's a winning bid, you guys keep it.  But you have to talk about it.  You have to keep it.  Sam has to wear it for a week.  Okay.  And you've got to talk about the auction.  Oh, we'll beat Sam with it.  We definitely will.  Grab it.  Can they get to the auction through your website?  Yeah, yeah, you can.  Okay, great.  Right away.  I want to buy it and just give it to E-Rock to wear.  Yeah, these guys would love that medal.  But if the bid comes in higher, then you're going to have to give the cash back.  Then I'll give you the money back.  Okay.  You know Sam's very poor.  I don't part with that.  He might be poorer than that African kid that you take care of, to be quite honest. 
[02:55:30]  That's true.  And not as good at radio.  And he's getting married soon.  Married with no money, Mick.  Are you getting married?  Yes, I am.  It's a Jess.  I know.  Yeah, I'd better.  I mean, I'd better, better, better, better, better, better, better.  It'd better.  Beard.  What?  What?  I had a cough.  Beard?  No.  Jess is so far out of his league, man.  It's amazing.  Jess looks good, right?  Yeah, she's really hot. 
[02:56:00]  She is out of my league.  Beautiful.  She's really smart.  And there's something in her self-esteem that is just not right.  Yeah, something.  I'm telling you, once that gets fixed, she will fucking walk out on him.  Oh, and realize, like, oh my God, this is the worst mistake I ever made.  One day, you're going to see a look on her face.  Like, she's going to be holding her head with both hands, looking in the mirror.  And that's how you're going to know she's realized.  That's the realization?  I'm a magnetic person.  This is feel-good stuff.  Can I interrupt you guys to bring forth a potentially really feel-good story?  Oh, please.  There's a young man who's going to, he's in the studio. 
[02:56:30]  He's going to be on The Blend at 10.30.  He's a tremendous singer.  When I last saw him, he was 14 years old.  He's in a wheelchair.  And then I was looking through the USA Today.  It was like 3.30.  I was trying to go to sleep, so I was just reading the paper.  And I saw his name with a new CD.  I was like, is this the kid that was helping me pick out, like, weapons to hit Terry Funk with in Toronto?  And so I got in touch with him, and he's here in the studio.  If I find him out there, can we bring him in, say hello to him?  He's here at XM? 
[02:57:00]  It'll be the first time I've seen him in 10 years, yeah.  Yeah.  Will he sing for us?  You know, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't want to put him under any pressure.  Is this some kind of wrestling bit, Sam?  This is not a bit.  I get confused with Mick Foley.  You think it's a work?  Is this a work?  Is this a work?  It's got to be a work.  He's going to kick him out of the chair and then beat the crap out of him.  By the way.  This is the announcement.  By the way, there's a bid coming in, because this guy just wants to see Sam hand back the money.  T-Bagger.  He's got music videos.  Hold on one second, Mick.  T-Bagger, go ahead. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, Sam, go ahead and get that money back, because I've already put in a 505 bid.  Oh, shit.  And look at Mick Foley quickly taking his wallet out.  I do take PayPal, but I'm not allowed to bid on my own stuff.  Here, give him 506.  I've got six bucks here.  Oh, damn.  No way.  All right, so now it's up to 506.  You've got to go increments of five, so it's up to 510.  Damn, man.  You're not going to get that quickly, pal.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  This says enter US 515.  Oh, man, you drive a hard bargain. 
[02:58:00]  I know.  All right, let's make it 520, okay?  Why do you have such a thick wallet?  What's in that wallet?  All the money he doesn't spend.  Yeah.  Can you tell us what's in that wallet right now?  Let me see.  I've got a lot of junk in there.  Diner's Club card.  An appropriate photo of my wife.  You want to take a look here?  I couldn't look at your...  That's your wife?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah?  See?  Mick's doing all right.  People can date out of their league.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you met him, I didn't have money either.  Sam Roberts.  What I did, I took a clue card, and I turned it into a thing of my son when he was a baby. 
[02:58:30]  So I got that.  You guys want to see this?  Yes, I want to see this stuff.  She's sexy.  Yeah, let's see a sex life in a bikini.  Nice.  Yeah.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, you're counting your front pocket.  Yeah, that's...  She's really hot.  Wow.  By the way, Sam Roberts, high bidder.  All right, nice, Sam.  We're up to 515.  Hey, Mick, do you take this?  Damn, she's got nice boobies.  Oh, Jesus.  Aren't they nice?  Nice boobies.  We all noticed, but we didn't have to say that. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Some things you just leave.  They are the highlighted feature in the photo.  She would appreciate it.  Some things just left unsaid.  Very nice.  We did an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap.  I think last time I was on, I was talking about doing it.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You did it with...  Who did you do it with?  I don't know if I'm allowed to divulge.  Oh, okay.  It hasn't aired yet?  It hasn't aired.  It's going to air.  And that's where I got the haircut.  It was with Hedda Nussbaum.  Sweet.  Hey, as long as it wasn't with Heidi Klum.  Hey, Long Island guy. 
[02:59:30]  You remember?  Hedda Nussbaum.  Hey, can we take a break?  I got to pee.  Hedda's the only one that took more hits than Nick did.  I'll try to find Justin.  Could you go find this Justin kid?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll see if he's up for singing.  And listen, honestly, you know, he sings, you know, the blend, it's, you know, it's very inspirational.  So don't mess with him.  First of all, I love how Mick, as he's saying it, he's looking around, and then when he goes,  and don't, he points right at open.  What?  Because he knows.  Am I always the problem?  Because he knows. 
[03:00:00]  He knows I'll sit here, and Jimmy will sit here.  Let me call you guys on something that disturbed me very much in the green room, okay?  I was listening to that woman, that very nice woman making the prank phone calls.  Carmen?  Oh, yes.  Carmen, and hearing you guys disrespect her, you know what it reminded me of?  I don't know.  It reminded me when you guys were on your way up, and Howard wouldn't give you any love.  Oh, man.  The same way Howard saw you as a threat, you see...  Carmen?  Carmen.  Carmen.  The Carmen prank phone call guy, girl, whatever it is. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, it's the Carmen prank call.  It's the circle of radio.  Yeah, it really is.  It happens.  We're bullies, Mick.  You have a chance to make...  You guys, look, as far as I'm concerned, you guys made my comedy career.  I think we're going to surprise you with this Justin Hines kid.  Yeah, let me try to find him, okay?  I think we're going to surprise you.  All right, okay.  If he doesn't sing, though, I don't want him in the studio.  Yeah, exactly.  There's no reason to have him in here, Mick.  Yep.  What?  I'm just being honest.  Just talk to him about the relationship.  About the AO.  He helped me find foreign objects to hit Terry Funk with.  Talk to him about Terry Funk.  And now he's on the blend.  He's a big wrestling guy, and now he's doing his own thing? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, he's like 25 now.  He was a kid when I met him.  Let me see if I can find him out there, okay?  More with Mick Foley.  Yeah, thanks, guys.  Maybe Justin Hines, and we'll be back.  I have to.  All right, we've got Mick Foley in the studio and a very special guest.  Right, Mick Foley?  Very, very special.  For those who weren't there before the break, should I tell this story?  Yeah, why not? 
[03:01:30]  All right.  We're just wasting time.  Oh, you go ahead.  You go ahead and tell it, and when it's time for me.  I know you guys have things about, like, something in Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh improv is not important.  The 20th or 22nd, who cares?  There's bigger things to think.  And just like I don't care about governors on October 8th, govs.com with an O, govs, G-O-V-E-N.  Oh, you really care.  That's the difference.  You really care.  You've got to mortgage the pace there in your new house because the fucking car dealer 
[03:02:00]  guy's got your old house.  I know.  It's always something we make.  Holy damn, man.  Why wouldn't you just, like, rent out your house until you figured out if Florida was  going to be the place for you?  Well, my wife came, let me add to that.  Let me not leave it at my wife came.  My wife came.  She came to talk to me.  Right.  And she said, you know, you're right.  The guy was, you know, stringing together financing for anybody in this market.  It's pretty tough.  Sure.  She was like, I think this is a sign that we should just stay in Long Island. 
[03:02:30]  So we told the kids we were moving back.  And literally, two days later, I got a call from the attorney going, we're in closing  right now.  And so I was without a house, you know, without a place to live.  I was just traveling back and forth looking for places.  And so we did.  We found a very nice place.  And, hey, can I mention, as long as I'm plugging, that PBS is going to be filming the show at  Governors for a special they're doing.  Damn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the stuff I do with Rain.  It's like for AARP. 
[03:03:00]  I didn't want to tell them that I'm not of that age yet.  You don't qualify yet.  I don't qualify.  No.  Because they've done stories like Joe Torre and Olivia Newton-John and, like, the work  they're involved with.  So I didn't want to turn it down.  Although you're an ex-wrestler, so you do qualify, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  I think they lower the age for ex-wrestlers.  I think after that Armin Kitean piece, they figured we'd better talk to him now.  These guys don't live very well.  Why don't you switch houses with this guy?  I'm obsessed.  You want us to call him and say, could you just give Mick his old house back and you  can have the one he moved into? 
[03:03:30]  It's not a bad idea.  You want to get a hold of him at Smithtown Nissan and say, come on.  He's not selling cars, I'm sure.  He is, yeah.  He's doing all right?  Yeah.  Well, what about Justin Hines?  All right.  Okay.  So he's an old friend of yours.  You've got to explain how you guys met.  Justin is...  How old are you now, Justin?  I'm 29.  29?  Yeah.  So I met you when you were, what, 14 or 15?  I think 16.  16?  Okay.  It would have been 13 years ago in 98 because I was wrestling against Terry Funk. 
[03:04:00]  And Justin had just won a national contest in Canada.  He's not an American.  Don't be tough on him.  Get out.  He'd won a national talent contest to sing the anthem, the Canadian anthem.  Yeah.  Not our patriotic one.  Right.  You know what?  I had to sing the American one as well.  Oh, you had to sing the American one as well.  You hear how he says, had to?  He had to, Nick.  Exactly.  He's a friend of yours?  He had to.  Which is harder?  Is the American one harder to sing? 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  Yes.  It's one of the hardest songs to sing, period, I think.  Isn't there like a lot of key changes or whatever?  The range is like...  You've got to start really low.  Should we point out, Justin's been in a wheelchair since...  Pretty much since ever.  Now, Mick, why'd you put him in a wheelchair?  What'd you do back when he was 16?  I wake up scared of barbed wire.  Yeah.  He was in the chair and actually he sang the anthem at Raw. 
[03:05:00]  Was it Raw, right?  Yeah.  Or was it...  Yeah, like a Raw show kind of thing.  The wrestling was a bigger deal to you than the basketball, right?  I have to admit, yes.  Okay.  Did you keep him away from Vince?  Because no invention.  We could use you.  I'm coming up with a storyline for you, Justin.  Jesus.  Well, somebody wanted to use my chair in a match, so...  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You know what?  No.  Not all these are jokes.  It's reality with Vince.  Full speed ahead right into his ass!  So, wheelchair for your whole life? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Since what age?  Yeah, I was born with a condition called Larson Syndrome.  What is that?  So, my joints do, like, really funky things.  Really funky things.  Yeah, they do.  I use them as percussion instruments, actually.  That's funk.  But can I point out that not only is Justin...  He's got a new CD out and he's going to be on the Blend at 10.30.  But look at how beautiful his wife is, right?  Yeah, she's all right there, Justin. 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  She's all right.  Are you Canadian, too, or did he steal you from America?  No.  Canadian, huh?  Oh, Canada.  How did you guys meet?  I don't know the rest of the words.  She actually...  She saw one of my videos in Canada, and we started conversing, doing the online thing  for a little while, and, you know, she drove halfway across the country.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Yeah, I don't know what I did to...  Well, you inspire that type of action, because I was telling the guys a story that it was 3.30,  and I really needed to get to bed.  I was going to just read the newspaper, drift off to sleep, and then I saw, like, the thing 
[03:06:30]  and the story on you in USA Today, and I was like, Justin Hines?  I was like, the kid that helped me pick out stuff?  Because I knew he'd been singing, because I remember you guys gave me the CD, Just a  Kid at Play.  Yeah, I'm getting very loud.  You know, that's going way back, right?  Did you throw it out the window, Mick?  Did you listen to it?  Did you listen to it?  Let's be honest.  I should point out that song I actually wrote, thinking of the life of a wrestler.  Really?  Isn't that weird?  Yeah.  I did not throw it out the window.  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  I'm asking. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, you can laugh at Obi.  He threw Godsmack's CD out the window before they made it.  But I didn't listen to it.  He's like, hey, could you listen to this, man?  We're a band.  We're local here in Boston.  Maybe you could listen.  He's like, yeah, listen.  Threw it out the window.  It's in the river.  One of the rivers.  And then, meanwhile, the jock that comes on after us actually listened to it, said it  was cool, and got the credit for breaking the Godsmack.  It might have been in a Rolling Stone article, but who needs it?  Yeah, yeah.  For being the guy.  Yeah, I'll give it a listen.  You guys remember the band Boston, of course. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We were just talking about them.  I was going to a barbecue.  I went to a Cal with one of those guys.  You see, it's always going to be a baseball game, Red Sox, Yankees game.  And a friend of mine, the guy with tickets, hey, if you don't mind, I can't do a Boston  accent.  Are you an accent guy, Gordon?  So you can say, hey, if you don't mind, I've got to stop off at my friend's house.  Jimmy's really good.  He used to be the drummer for Boston.  Close your eyes, man.  You're going to think you're in fucking Fenway.  Hey, I don't mind. 
[03:08:00]  I've got to stop off at my friend's house.  It's in Boston.  It's right on, isn't it?  That's spot on, man.  I don't know why you're laughing.  I said, Shib?  He goes, oh, you know, Sibby.  That's your Sib with the big hairdo.  You know, he had like that giant afro.  So Sib was like one of the coolest guys you could ever meet.  His big tagline.  We'd party with Sib.  Did you really?  Yeah, when we used to work at AAF.  So you know what a cool guy is, right?  Yeah, nothing to do.  So he hung out at AAF events.  Did he use the phrase, out of sight?  Yeah.  Out of sight.  He was groovy.  Out of sight.  And it was like that feel good thing that after I talked to him and on my way home, I put the 
[03:08:30]  CD in.  And he did a remake of the Boston song, Smokin'.  And he sounded more like Cheech and Chong.  Man, this is the biggest joint I've ever seen.  He did this really slow, drum-laden version of Smokin'.  Of Smokin' that we all remember, of course, Boston doing.  And it was like, at maximum 20 seconds, I had that thing out of the player.  And I called up my friend.  I was like, God, I know Sibby was a great guy.  I went, that CD is terrible.  He goes, oh, it is rotten. 
[03:09:00]  It is fuckin' rotten.  He goes, don't get me wrong, I love Sibby, but it is rotten.  That is one piece of crap.  That's not the way I felt about hearing Justin's music.  No, no.  I got a little worried.  I was like, oh dear.  No, not at all.  I thought you got an amazing voice, right?  You got spirit, right?  He's always got a huge smile.  Do you want to sell the guy?  I am.  I'm trying to sell him to your audience, man.  He sounds like a cool guy. 
[03:09:30]  He's going to win over the blend audience, but he needs that.  At 1030, he's going to be on the blend.  Yeah, yeah.  So you guys might want to.  I need more edge, huh?  I guess.  What?  I need a little more edge.  Is that what it is?  For this show?  No.  No.  This is why you're going to touch people, and they're going to drift over there.  Oh, if it was years ago, you'd need edge.  Not anymore.  We've given up.  We've just given up.  Hey, you know what?  You're going to think I'm crazy, but Justin, I'm auctioning off the Medal of Reasonableness.  The Medal of Reasonableness.  Isn't that crazy?  Jon Stewart gives this to me in front of a quarter of a million people.  And in Latin, this means may the force be with you. 
[03:10:00]  That is pretty good.  That's kind of cool.  What is the bid up to Sam?  I'm still number one.  Is Justin going to sing for us, or what?  We should do something.  Do you usually have accompaniment when you sing?  I do.  But, uh...  Is the guy here yet?  Actually, aren't you going to...  Savannah, are you going to...  Does Savannah play?  Do some background singing?  No.  No?  But I was thinking you guys do some backgrounds.  Tell me what you want to sing.  I don't know any Foley songs. 
[03:10:30]  I do a nice take on Barry Manilow's Mandy.  Really?  Yeah.  I sing the song from Mandy's point of view.  I do.  Barry?  What's it said?  How does it go?  Get away from me, you queen.  That song always bothered me because, you know, oh, Mandy, you came and you gave without  taking, but I sent you away, kissed me, and stopped me from shaking.  I was like, why?  Like, that's a poor choice.  It's a poor life choice.  You find somebody like that, and you send her away, and then he needs her today. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  He needs her today.  He wants her back.  And so I do at Governors, and it kills very little.  Governors this weekend, they can hear the Mandy.  October 8th, yeah, I'm going to do my Mandy, and I have musical accompaniment coming with  me, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  Very nice.  Which is nice.  But you can just belt out a tune.  Oh, okay.  I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot.  I'll be clear.  Okay.  Acapella.  Whenever he gets us to 10, this is fine. 
[03:11:30]  Acapella.  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm going to be in that meeting in four minutes.  I swear.  Acapella?  Sure.  All right.  What are you going to do?  Original composition?  I should probably do one of my own tunes.  I'm on the radio.  I don't know.  I would think it doesn't matter.  Well, you know what?  Here's the argument that people might also, this is uncharted territory here, right?  Have you had a young man in a wheelchair? 
[03:12:00]  Oh, I thought you were going to stop it.  Have you had a young man?  There goes Jimmy.  Well, you know.  Exactly.  You know that song?  Hey.  It was written by me.  It was a buddy of mine.  Ricky Springfield.  Gary Glitter.  Gary Glitter.  I know.  But when I met Rick Springfield in like 99, you know, he's in that Boogie Night scene  where the guy's throwing the...  You guys have seen that, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Rick Springfield's that scene?  No, no.  Oh, but they're playing Sister Christian.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the guy's all coked up.  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Ricky Springfield, he's a buddy of mine.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So when I saw Rick Springfield, that was my thing.  Ricky Springfield is a buddy of mine.  He looked at me like, you're an effing loser.  He's probably heard that a lot.  Did he recognize you?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was there with his kid.  He was a big wrestling fan.  Wasn't that Doc Ock that was walking around that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the guy that's in Indiana Jones going,  Indy, give me the idol, Indy.  Give me that.  That's the same guy.  Same guy.  Yeah.  He was a lot younger and skinny back then.  That was a great scene.  It's one of the best scenes in a movie. 
[03:13:00]  How nervous.  And they jump every time the firecrackers go on.  How masterful was that guy playing a coked out guy in a robe,  just like jamming through the sun.  Oh, yeah.  Singing along.  It was a fantastic scene, man.  The other tune was Sister Christian by Nightmare.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Good song, man.  He's like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Don't do me.  He's like all into it.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, the guy's ruining the song with firecrackers.  Fucking homoerotic relationship.  It's a kind of waif.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Sam Roberts is throwing fireworks.  Iraq called Smithtown Nissan and told all the guy's coworkers  that he lived in Foley's house.  Oh, that's great.  He's got to give the house back.  Man.  I miss that house.  He's going to call in?  Yeah, Iraq said when the guy gets to work.  Do you have a better house, though?  When the guy gets to work?  Or is it comparable to what you used to have?  Yeah, it's a beautiful view, but now we're adding up all the things that we gave up to  have that great view of the river, and it's like, man, we don't have the basement, we don't  have that property, no Christmas room. 
[03:14:00]  Oh.  You can't put a dollar tag on it.  I mean, you can put a dollar tag on the Medal of Reasonableness, which I'm optioning off  at realmickfoley.com.  Yes.  You can also go to catch up on my latest events.  Jimmy's back on his phone.  Focus.  Focus, Mick.  I'm actually going to realmickfoley.com.  Focus, Mick.  You're losing him.  You're losing him.  That's your barometer.  If you see Jimmy reach for his phone, you've got to change topics.  What I was going to say to Justin is, because this is uncharted territory before we got  off on whether or not.  You might have to go with a song that we all know, so they stay in there.  Yeah, that people will, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  And then we say your name, and then we say the blend, and then we sell some CDs.  And you segway, and you go over there, and you rock the blend.  Wait, does he have a CD out, though?  Yeah, he does.  I have three.  So, what's the website?  Myname.com.  JustinHeinz.  Okay, JustinHeinz.com.  Because it's like, if you want people to buy the stuff, shouldn't he sing something that's  original?  Okay, let's go for it.  Well, I can do a cover that was on one of my records.  Yeah.  What was the cover?  Salisbury Hill.  You guys know that?  Yeah, I love it.  Peter Gabriel.  Yeah, I love Salisbury Hill.  Is that like Blueberry Hill, but that's not the dessert part?  I'm in a book.  Oh, wow.  I could see those sitting in the heart.  I like to Bombardier. 
[03:15:00]  When you go to the boom, boom, boom part, I'm going to do boom, boom, boom.  We'll all do it.  All right.  We'll all do it.  I don't know the songs.  You'll know it when you do it.  I don't know it.  Do you have Salisbury Steak?  I do not, no.  I like the food.  I love the food.  Dining up on Salisbury Steak.  Why don't we turn the lights down?  Okay, let's do it.  Yeah, let's turn the lights down.  A little mood lighting.  All right.  All right, here we go.  There you go.  Beautiful.  That's better. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  This is Justin Hines, Mick Foley's friend from years ago.  We're ready?  We're ready.  All right.  Yeah, we're ready.  Clobbing up on Salisbury Hill, I could see the city light.  Wind was blowing and time stood still.  The eagle flew out of the night.  Well, he was something to observe.  And came in close, I heard a voice.  Standing, stretching every nerve.  I had to listen. 
[03:16:00]  Had no choice.  I did not believe the information.  I just had to trust imagination.  My heart was going boom, boom, boom.  Son, he said, grab your things.  I've come to take you home.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  La Capella.  Nice.  That scared me, actually.  I don't know the song.  I was like, why is he yelling over the man's song? 
[03:16:30]  Who's the hardest guy to sing?  Like, if you have to sing somebody, who's the, who's really difficult to mimic?  To mimic?  Or I should say, I shouldn't say mimic.  Which guy's songs are difficult to do the way they did it?  Yeah, I mean, I think it's funny, because as an artist, I think your goal is to try to  kind of make a song.  Make a draw.  Make your own.  I think that's actually more challenging than mimicking.  You know what?  I have an argument with people who try to make God Bless America their own, because that's 
[03:17:00]  a much easier song.  Especially when they change it to, like, another country.  Sometimes the best renditions are the ones that are the most subdued.  I totally agree.  Right?  Yeah.  You ever hear when they, you know, they try to do, like, the vocal curly cues?  Curly cues?  I hate that vocal aerobics thing.  Yeah.  Gymnastics, we were saying?  Gymnastics, yeah.  Stamic crap.  Yeah.  That's really good.  It's like sometimes, you know, like... 
[03:17:30]  You can do trills.  We love it.  Great.  What's a trill?  That's where they go.  You get a line of something?  Yeah, yeah.  Trill.  When you go on a rollercoaster or something.  As much as I love Aaron Neville, like, he kind of hacked up...  I don't like Aaron Neville.  You don't like him?  That thing on his head.  How can you look at him?  It's horrendous.  Not a big fan.  He smells wonderful.  Like, have you ever met him?  Oh, I thought you were just going to say he smells.  We met him.  My whole family met him, and he's a big wrestling fan.  Yeah.  And I didn't ask for his cologne, but, man, he is a good... 
[03:18:00]  What about that growth?  Yeah.  You know what?  He smells so good, you overlook it.  You could chop that thing off.  Of course you could.  Put a hat on it.  Do something.  Put a hat on the front of his head.  What are you doing?  Seeing love songs.  It's not like it's in the middle of your back and no one knows.  It's on your face.  What's the name of his big song?  He's in a lot of big songs.  The ones he did with Linda Ronstadt.  Hey, I've spent all...  Help me out, Justin.  I'm drowning here.  Hey, I've spent...  None of us know that one.  I've spent all my life with you. 
[03:18:30]  It's the first time Mick's ever said, hey, I spent.  You know, cheap fuck.  Jesus.  Hey, as long as we're plugging Friends of Mine's music, can we hit the Grace Potter video?  Paris?  Yeah, Grace Potter's the one doing this cool fundraiser that I'm just a small part of.  Nice.  And you know Grace's music?  I don't, but...  Man, she's smoking. 
[03:19:00]  At some point.  Yeah.  Is she hot?  Yeah.  She's super nice, too.  Yeah.  She's got a great voice.  All right.  And we're going to see her in five seconds when she sings Paris.  Ooh la la.  Yeah, ooh la la.  What?  And you guys probably know this tune because they're using it on like Dancing with the Stars.  I don't watch Dancing with the Stars.  How would we know it, then?  What's wrong with you?  Exactly.  Is he getting scat porn?  I don't know.  She's all right, though, big.  Yeah.  Sing it, Grace.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Come on, sing it, Grace.  Ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  What happened to this segment?  What's going on here?  Sam's looking.  He's like it.  She's a good voice.  Yeah.  Got me down on the floor.  She's the one doing the charity benefit?  Yeah, she's a Vermonter.  And, you know, she's a really, like, a very cool, nice person. 
[03:20:00]  And so-  Is she married?  No, she's not married.  Would she go out with Jim Norton?  Married.  Highly unlikely to quote Gorilla Monsoon.  Wow, why?  Wow.  She's taken.  She's engaged.  Does everything have to have a wrestling angle with you?  He's quoting Gorilla Monsoon.  When did Gorilla Monsoon say that?  Every other.  He said a lot.  I don't know this shit.  He's the greatest.  He's Gorilla Monsoon.  You landed on the back of your head.  You landed on your external octubral protuberance.  Yeah.  Oh, that was a good one.  I remember that. 
[03:20:30]  So why not Jimmy Norton?  You know, she's taken.  She's engaged.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  That's a good, all right.  That's a reason, I guess.  But she's rocking the, you know, doing a big concert and they're trying to raise a hundred  grand and I'm like, you know what?  If they got to 95 and I had the power to get that other five through the Medal of Reasonableness  and the Juggalo jersey I wore at the Gathering, I'd say you got to go for it.  That shirt is up there, man.  I thought that Mick's been selling all his shit.  Exactly.  What happened to Mick growing up that he's so obsessed with? 
[03:21:00]  Were you beaten with all possessions?  I know.  Is he trying to get rid of them?  I do.  If I could give away everything I owned except for Christmas-related items, I'd do it.  You love Christmas stuff, don't you?  I would.  What is that about you, Mick?  I don't know.  Did you have a bet?  The only time of year he wasn't struck with a closed fist was right, Christmas.  Christmas time was truce time.  Yeah, exactly.  No more drinking and hitting it.  Right.  Wait till January 1st.  Here's the flannel shirt that I wore for my big promo.  We got the picture.  Oh, the flannel. 
[03:21:30]  If you go to that.  Is it a real flannel?  It's like one of the real ones you wore?  It's a little bit different, but you can see Ric Flair laying a big punch on me.  Yeah.  And that was the interview where I told Ric that we both had something.  Yeah.  Woo.  He's really tagging me there.  And we had a great emotional promo segment and it concluded with Ric punching me.  And that shirt is up for sale for auction to help out my friend.  Why don't you give us something today?  We want to be on all the wrestling blogs.  Yeah.  Believe me, it's already been a Google News. 
[03:22:00]  Did you read it?  I saw a Google News.  One of the blog sites said, Mick Foley to make huge announcements on LNA.  I'm not kidding.  It's on there.  And there's no follow-up because they realize the announcement's a big, gutter rule.  He keeps tweeting that he has announcements.  Mick always tweets that he has, I'm going to announce.  It's a great work.  It's a great work.  Every wrestling website picks it up.  And then it's always like a comedy date.  It's always something not wrestling related.  This is where I got in trouble with my own base.  You have horrible announcements.  I mean, I know it's for a good cause, but we were expecting a little something with some juice. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  I told you to be prepared to be so, and I capitalized, so disappointed.  So disappointed.  And inflated would have been a better word.  But we thought that was, you know, you were trying to turn it around on us.  And then we were like disappointed.  That was fantastic.  That's amazing.  All right.  Here we go.  So Mick goes, I'll send it out in the first 20 minutes of Raw for maximum effectiveness.  He's going to have a big announcement on our show.  So then I write.  We were texting back and forth.  I go, nice.  I'll retweet.  He goes, cool.  You guys will be so let down by the announcement. 
[03:23:00]  Well, yeah.  Again, Mick didn't lie.  You want to throw a little something else out there that maybe the wrestling blogs will pick up, Mick?  Let me see.  Something?  Something.  Let me think about it.  You guys converse for a couple minutes.  I'm going to go soften the beaches for us down the hall.  The wrestling sites will pick up on Mick saying a lot during this interview that he is coming back.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:23:30]  He is coming back.  The one where I got in trouble was Hugh Jackman went out and he said, hey, right here in Cleveland, Ohio, which is like my cheap pop catchphrase.  Right.  And so people say, hey, Mick, what do you think of Hugh Jackman doing that?  Now, tell me the key word, right, in comedy.  I said, well, maybe I'll show Jackman how it's done when I show up as the secret guest referee at Hell in a Cell.  And then when I didn't show up, people got mad at me.  And I was like, you know, the word secret was supposed to be like the. 
[03:24:00]  That's the whole.  Okay.  Why would you tell the secret?  Well, it was on.  And that was, again, every wrestling blog takes it literally and goes, Mick Foley teases return at Hell in a Cell.  Sam, I don't know what this means, but last night when we were texting each other, Mick Foley said that.  He's going to be the anonymous raw general manager.  He said that to you?  Yeah, he texted that to me last night.  So I don't really know what that means because I don't watch wrestling, but it might mean something to somebody out there.  But he did text that to me.  Anonymous raw general manager. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know what that is.  That's huge.  Why would that be huge?  Because the anonymous raw general manager has been anonymous for a very long time.  Everybody's been wondering, who is this guy?  Well, he told me it was him, whatever that, if that means anything to him.  It means a lot.  I'll get the blogs.  Wrestling.  Blogosphere going.  I'm going to pee.  Yeah.  This is what you do to people, Mick.  They just leave the room while you're still on.  You guys don't realize, but Norton just made my career here.  Yeah?  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  He laughed at my thing, and I'm going to open up for him at a couple of his shows. 
[03:25:00]  All right, Justin Hines, thank you.  You're going to be on the Blend in a half hour.  You got it.  And you got a website, justinhines.com, is it?  That's the one.  Very good.  And you got a couple CDs out there for people to check out?  You got it.  Good job at Salisbury Hill.  Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  Very good.  We were part of that, too.  Yeah, I did the boom, boom, boom, boom.  It was really loud and stuff.  I enjoyed it.  People just leaving the studio?  Yeah.  Mick just fucking faltered on us.  Jim and Anthony and God.  Hey, you know, this is how rumors get started.  He just ran out of gas.  He just ran out of gas.  He just ran out of gas.  Let's be honest. 
[03:25:30]  The rumor is going to be that I tanked on this show.  In truth, I rocked.  I rocked.  You're good for 55 minutes, not an hour.  That's how I look at it.  You're a solid 55.  I'm a 55-minute man.  You're a 55-minute man.  I got a business meeting coming up right now.  I got to go outside.  A meeting outside the doors.  Yeah?  Important business.  What do you mean?  Well, I'll just leave it at me.  It doesn't have to do with my show on October 8th, the governor's in Ruppertown.  That's this weekend.  Just say this weekend.  Yeah, it's this weekend. 
[03:26:00]  Friday.  Saturday.  Saturday.  Thursday.  Yeah, Saturday.  Saturday, 730.  Okay.  RealMcFoley.com.  Okay.  Or Govs.com.  Okay.  It doesn't have to do with that.  It's something completely different.  And what's the bid up to?  It's still 515.  I'm still on top.  Sam's to lose.  Not good.  I thought we'd do better than that.  You know what?  The people are waiting.  Yeah.  It's a waiting game.  And they wait until the end.  Honestly, it's like it's...  Have you ever seen one of these auctions take place?  Yeah, for sure.  Very exciting.  Those last few minutes when people are wheeling and dealing.  It's almost like those old bodybuilding contests where guys are throwing poses. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  So all the action goes down in the last minute or two of these things?  Last five minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you're telling yourself?  It's going to...  I predict...  What you're telling yourself?  Hey, we already up for 515.  We had a 505 bid.  A legitimate 505 bid.  That's right.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, that is good.  That's pretty good.  It's going to help out a lot of people.  And I'm going to have to avoid Mick if somebody outbids me when he tries to get his money back.  Well, there's something going on here.  Mick was supposed to bring Sam something. 
[03:27:00]  Well, technically...  You promised him, Mick.  What did I say I was going to bring?  You said next time you would come in, you would bring Sam something from your personal collection.  And then Jim asked you to bring something obnoxiously big that I could put in my apartment and upset Jesse.  I've only got one penis.  I need it, man.  Thanks, Justin.  Justin liked that.  Jesus, don't laugh too hard.  I'm worried about you.  I'm going to pick one of those pictures of my wife.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Blow that up?  Yeah, blow it up.  You can put it up in here. 
[03:27:30]  Jess will be psyched with that.  Are those, you know...  Okay, I'm sorry.  All right.  Wow.  Why are you handing out pictures of your wife in a bikini?  Because I needed something to give Sam that was...  But that's...  I don't think your wife would appreciate you just handing out her bikini picture.  She won't mind.  I don't think you know my wife that well.  Well, then why can't I ask, you know, about some things?  Sam, give me the damn picture. 
[03:28:00]  I gave him $515.  That's all he's getting.  Give him the money back, Sam.  He needs it.  No, no.  If I give it back to him, then I'm stuck and I win the auction.  Oh, really?  And then you have to pay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And where am I going to find that kind of cash from?  Sam and I, we keep in touch.  So I'm...  He's good for the money if he doesn't win.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Make another great appearance on our show.  We appreciate it.  Hey, it's always a blast.  And this is the first time I actually went through you directly.  Yeah.  I like that.  In the past, I've waited for somebody to call.  We might be celebrity friends now. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  When you have a celebrity friend, you don't have to really do much with that person.  You're just kind of celebrity friends.  Yeah.  And then you talk about...  Unless you want to take it to the next level and become friends.  That might involve dinner in Smithtown somewhere.  Seeing the old house and the new house.  Yeah.  You are welcome to come over.  Yeah.  Honestly, yeah.  Seeing the old house and you're going to drive by a mixed old house and somebody else  If we become friends, I'm going to force him to drive by the old house.  The old house is so much nicer. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, dude.  That sucks.  We're all so sad.  I can't believe that happened.  It was beautiful.  We had acreage.  It was nice.  You liked your neighbors and all, probably?  Or no?  Soledad O'Brien was my next door neighbor.  Really?  Yeah.  Her parents were, you know, with the house she grew up in.  No kidding.  So when I was on the Today Show in 2000, she asked me if I'd just moved into Smithtown.  I was like, yeah.  And she said, you know, I'm your next door neighbor.  Wow.  So I'd see her, like, walking with the kids.  Right.  Yeah.  So it was pretty cool to have a celebrity neighbor. 
[03:29:30]  Is Park Bench still there?  Yeah.  Park Bench is still there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had to do gigs there.  Did you really?  Yeah.  What kind of gigs?  You mean, like, radio gigs from the bench?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I worked for BAB, we were forced to, like, get out in the community.  And I would have to go to the park bench and spin, like, tunes for a happy hour.  Is that around the same time that we heard the tape of you and Ant broadcasting from a bus stop?  No, that's Boston.  Oh.  Because they were closing up the bus stop or something.  And then you brought guests from a church. 
[03:30:00]  My worst gig, it was either, I think it was Valentine's Day, off the Long Island Expressway at one of those shitty gas stations, fucking giving out roses to the women.  That was the worst one I did for BAB.  It's a tough thing, you know, when you have to cross over that line from, you know, radio, like, personality to star.  Right.  And it's almost like, you know, like, when I see the BLI guys, and my kids listen to them.  Yeah.  And they go, hey, we watch it.  And they're like, I know you're on radio, but it's not really a big deal. 
[03:30:30]  Right, right.  It's like, if you were a big deal, you wouldn't be here.  Yeah.  And that same thing.  There's not many of us that are a big deal in this business.  It's sad.  You got the market cornered here, brother.  Oh, boy, do we.  Yeah.  Seven years ago today, we started on satellite radio.  You're kidding me.  No.  This might be Anthony going, can you come down the hall?  Yeah, he's kidding me.  Hello?  Hey, who's this?  Hang up on me.  It's Anthony, you son of a bitch.  Just let me know how the meeting went.  Take notes for me. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I want to take notes?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think you ought to be in here for the police.  All right.  I'll be right down.  We're supposed to be in a meeting.  I got to go to my business meeting, too.  Huh?  It was the lesser of two evils.  I figured I'd do more radio with you than go meet with the boss.  All right, man.  Let's take that next step.  Dinner sometime.  Yeah, that sounds good.  So, Justin Hines, once again, the real McFoley online.  Just real McFoley. 
[03:31:30]  Not the.  No the.  Oh, real McFoley.  Okay.  Yeah, dot com.  Governor's Saturday and all the other things that Mick's involved with will be on his website,  real McFoley.  I think that's the easiest way to do it.  I think it's.  I just.  Twitter, real McFoley.  Website, real McFoley.  Right.  Facebook, real McFoley.  Okay.  All those sites.  OP Radio on Twitter.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Justin Fogler.  That's much easier to remember than Anthony's because Anthony.  Kumia.  Yeah.  Kumia.  People don't know how to spell it.  It gets confusing.  And opradio.com.  Yeah.  Putting that shit together. 
[03:32:00]  I've heard rumors about that website.  Yeah.  Yeah, real McFoley.com.  All right.  Thank you, Mick.  Thank you, Justin.  Thank you, Justin's wife.  Thanks.  Blah, blah, blah.  Seven years.  Yay.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  OP and Anthony have left the building.  After ONA Live is next on The Virus.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the OP and Anthony show continues. 
[03:32:30]  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I see Club Soda Kenny is still down the hallway.  That means they're still meeting.  Yep.  No sign of them.  They both went down to the boss's office.  I think it's just a state of the show type meeting.  It's nothing huge or anything.  But Club Soda Kenny is not near the studio right now. 
[03:33:00]  He's more down the hall all the way towards the offices.  I guess just waiting for OP and Anthony to get done with their meeting with the boss.  This is After ONA Live brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan.  America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Yeah.  I said it.  And it's very funny watching the show today because, of course, Mick Foley was in here.  Probably my favorite guest of all time.  Ever.  Anthony left at, like, 9.55. 
[03:33:30]  He just kind of left the show and went down to the boss's office trying to get the meeting started so that way he could leave earlier.  You get it started earlier.  You get it finished earlier.  Then, OP didn't want to go to the meeting, so he just kind of hung out in the studio for a while and actually got the show done later.  Uh-oh.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny.  Maybe we can get an update on the timing because Anthony obviously wanted this done lickety-split.  And you know what?  The guy's right.  His hours here are 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. 
[03:34:00]  And by my clock, it's 16 after the hour, folks.  Here's Club Soda Kenny in the house.  What's up, Club Soda?  Hi, Prime Time.  What's the topic of the day?  We were just talking about the meeting and how Anthony left the show early thinking he'd be able to get out of the meeting early.  But then OP just stayed at the show until whatever it was, 10-10.  Okay.  What do you know what's going on down there? 
[03:34:30]  We're in a meeting.  That's why I'm here.  Roland told me that there's a street closure on 7-49.  Here's the update.  Breaking news.  The streets reopened.  Oh, thank God.  Because otherwise, Opie and Anthony would be, well, Anthony at least, would be stuck here.  Negative.  Why?  Because Anthony is going east.  The street closure was to the west.  Oh, thank God you are on top of it, Club Soda Kenny.  Of course.  Well, what do you think?  My name is you?  What do you do with yourself while you're waiting for ONA to get done with this meeting? 
[03:35:00]  Well, I was just harassing the mashups.  Oh, you saw it.  I know.  That's the one.  I'll tell you this.  Kenny likes to make the most of his time.  And he waits for the mashups, as he calls them, the people on the morning mashup show, to walk by and just annoys them purposely.  Yeah.  Like, you try to think, do you think of annoying questions the day before or that day of what you're going to bother them with?  I do my homework.  You do.  So, like, last night you were sitting there, like, what's a really, like, obnoxious question to just ask? 
[03:35:30]  No, like, you tune into, like, Covino and Rich.  Covino and Rich.  Yeah.  That's, I guess, morning mashup Rich.  He does the show Covino and Rich.  Yeah.  And what?  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, I'm always, like, telling him how terrific he is and, you know, Covino's got a problem.  You like Rich a little more than Covino?  No, I don't care for either of them.  But, you know, it just passes the time.  And you just figure that way, you know, you get, so you're conveying some kind of emotion, 
[03:36:00]  probably inflate Rich's ego and get Covino a little bit pissed off.  You know what I mean?  I'm just about killing time.  Yeah.  I got to be here all morning.  They spend more time fixing their hair than they do show prep, I've heard.  I wouldn't know.  No?  You don't hear in the afternoons?  No, then there's some guy's spot.  He's their producer.  Yeah.  But nobody cares.  This is the after show.  That's right.  After Opie and Anthony live.  Yeah.  Do you have any information about what this meeting is about? 
[03:36:30]  Business.  Business?  Yeah.  As we discussed on the show.  Now, we talked about it on the show today, actually, that one of the bosses is the only  person that I've come across who's not a fan of the month that we're in now, which is  Jocktober.  I heard that being asserted yesterday.  Oh, you heard the actual back and forth.  Where are you at with Jocktober?  I could take it or leave it.  You're not an emotional guy.  You're not a guy with a lot of joys in life. 
[03:37:00]  That's not true, Sam.  What are your joys?  We just haven't found my hot topic yet, Mike.  What interests Club Soda Kenny?  Like, when the work is done and you're sitting at home, what is it that goes through your  head that makes you say, oh, this is a stimulating thought?  That's something we've never...  Of the years that you've been on the Opie and Anthony show, we've never figured out what  topic would stimulate thought in Club Soda Kenny.  Sam, this isn't about me.  This is the after hour. 
[03:37:30]  No, no, no.  This is whatever I say it's about.  No, no, no.  Oh, excuse me.  I'm not being...  I'm trying to get to the bottom of what stimulates that brain inside your head.  What gets those impulses going?  What do you think?  I have no idea.  That's why I'm asking.  I don't think any of us at home know either.  All right.  You just looking to see if you can get out of here?  They're not coming up the hall yet.  Listen, I'm diligent.  I have to keep an eye on things.  I'm working. 
[03:38:00]  You're doing well.  I'm just killing time while I'm...  You know, I can multitask.  What do you do when you're not working?  I do things.  What are your hobbies?  I like to go to the gymnasium.  Oh, you do?  You like to work out?  Yeah.  You ever heard that song, Sexy and I Know It?  By LMFAO?  You work out when you're listening to that?  No.  They play BPM at my gym.  Oh, they do?  Do you like BPM?  Beats per minute.  Isn't that the station that Troy's on every now and then?  No.  Troy's on, like, another one. 
[03:38:30]  The dance?  One of the dance channels.  I don't know.  And that's all you do with your free time, though?  Because I know you get bored and call me sometimes when you're driving.  So I know you drive.  I know you go to the gym.  Yeah, I love to drive distracted.  Yeah, and the last thing you want to do is concentrate on what's going on on the road.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just boring.  It's the same thing over and over again.  Yeah, when I'm driving, I just go through my phone book alphabetically.  You do the same calls, too. 
[03:39:00]  Like, because I've been here, and Troy will be like, oh, my God, Sam, Club Soda Kenny called me for no reason yesterday, and I'll ask him what you said to him, and it will be verbatim the same conversation that you had with me.  So, uh, did you hear Covino and Rich today?  Yeah, I don't discriminate.  No, you don't.  But you could not have one conversation to have with everybody in your phone book.  What's wrong with that?  Well, it takes away a lot of the human element from the personal interaction. 
[03:39:30]  No.  You don't find that to be so?  No.  Because I have a very limited repertoire.  So what else do you do?  You drive, you go to the gymnasium.  He enjoys Facebook.  I know you do.  Like, you were a very late adapter to Facebook, because you always said, I'm not on Facebook because why?  I'm not looking to hook up.  That's right.  I got on Facebook by accident.  How did you get on Facebook by accident?  You have to put in your information. 
[03:40:00]  I know, but it's like a long story.  We got time.  No, you only got an hour.  That's true.  Um, all right.  So are you liking Facebook now that you're on?  A lot.  5,000 people like me.  Is that, are you happy about that?  Yes.  I, why, why wouldn't I be?  I don't know if you have a different goal in mind or if you want to be more private.  I don't know.  5,000 artificial friends.  Well, you couldn't, I mean, they're, they're fans of yours. 
[03:40:30]  It's a fan page.  They like you.  All right.  I like them.  That's very nice of you to see.  You don't have to, I don't know why you're being hostile saying nice things.  What do you mean?  Oh my God.  Do you, what's your, what do you like to do?  What's wrong?  I don't know.  All of a sudden this guy's piping in.  The Ron and Fez intern?  I think he just coughed.  Did he say something?  No, he was laughing at me.  Oh, wow.  You're an entertaining guy.  No, he was laughing at me, not with me.  Oh, like look at this dope on the microphone. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  I don't like that.  Yeah.  People, people need to realize that the things you do, you know, your humor is intentional.  It's not like you're just some dope.  Whatever.  Whatever indeed.  Yeah.  So nothing.  You like to go to the gymnasium and you like to pronounce words fully.  They're usually abbreviated.  Not necessarily.  Fine.  Anything else?  Sometimes I abbreviate words.  You do?  Yeah.  Like what? 
[03:41:30]  Give me one.  Give me a word you abbreviate here on After Opie Anthony Live with Club Soda Kenny.  Give me one.  Well, sometimes people like say, oh, you're jealous.  And I'll go, oh, you're gelled.  Gelled?  Where does the D come in?  You got to end it.  You got to end the word.  No, it would be, you're so gel.  That's what like teenage girls say, gel.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 54 years old.  I'm not a teenage girl.  Yeah.  But teenage girls are the ones who abbreviate words like that.  Not, not, not where I come from. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, yours is more like a street vernacular.  Yeah.  I'm street.  I see.  Okay.  So you listen to the morning mashup in the mornings.  Some mornings.  Like what?  Monday through Friday?  No, I listened to this show.  It's very entertaining.  But you have two ears, right?  Yes.  So what's going on in the other ear?  And there's also Wake Up With Taylor on the Cosmo channel.  How's that show?  You're a good source to go to for all the different programming here.  Because you, you use both of your ears and you do different things every day. 
[03:42:30]  So you get a taste of everything going on.  So Covino and Rich, you don't particularly care for either of them.  No, they're great guys.  I was just, you know, being facetious.  Well, don't just say nice things about people now because you think they're going to get mad at you.  What about the Wake Up With Taylor?  No, Kira, they can't beat me up.  That's a good call.  They can't.  There's no way.  I've seen them.  Yeah.  You're way bigger.  Yeah.  What about Wake Up With Taylor?  Is that a good show or not really?  Yeah, yeah.  With her gravelly voice.  Do you like that? 
[03:43:00]  Oh, shit.  Is it a little sexual?  You said it.  Okay.  I remember Wake Up With Taylor is the show that we did on Cosmo Radio when they talked to you.  How about Betsy from the Martha Stewart channel?  Who's Betsy?  She's the morning girl.  Yeah?  What does she do?  I don't know.  She does Martha Stewart in the morning.  What does she do to you?  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  You know I'm not looking to hook up.  Okay.  I'm just saying.  I thought you were getting...  Do you like her?  I'm sure she's a very nice woman. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  Well, Wake Up With Taylor is the show that we did when they played your parody songs, your  Fireflies and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And I thought that because every other song you've done, you've just done word for word  a cover of it.  Fireflies, you changed up the lyrics.  Yeah.  And so I gave them the CDs and they asked if they were clean.  You know, when I'm on the road with Superstar Jim Norton, a lot of people compliment me on  my singing. 
[03:44:00]  So I thought the CD was clean.  But I haven't sung like a song in a long time.  Like, I should have sung like Adele.  Well, there's a new Adele song.  Rolling in the Deep.  Well, no.  Now there's a new one.  You know?  You have to sing the new one.  I should have sang like Moves Like Jagger.  You could still sing that.  But, I mean, we did that.  We did Club City Kenny Sings.  Like, there's not any big sort of bad romance level song. 
[03:44:30]  Adele rolling in the deep wasn't a big song?  Not as big as bad romance.  Not on that level.  No way.  I bet.  Well, no.  Actually, they did.  We did a segment on it.  But what I was saying was they played.  I know what you were saying.  They played the Fireflies song on Wake Up With Taylor with you replacing all the lyrics  to talk about jerking off under your bed.  Yeah, because that song was, you know, it needed a little something.  Well, pick me up.  Yeah.  Well, listen, Club City Kenny, today's a special day in the world of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:45:00]  I know.  It's the seven-year anniversary.  Were you, you were, when did you start doing the show on satellite radio?  Like, when was the first time you were on the show?  Well.  Not like regularly, but like the first.  Well, back then, I was working part-time for this organization.  Right.  Because I had another job subsequently.  Subsequently.  And we had another security guard subsequently.  Yeah.  I'm not a security guard. 
[03:45:30]  What are you?  I'm a security specialist.  Oh.  Well, we had a security guard before you.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so when was the first time you?  When they went on the promotional tour to promote their comeback.  Oh, so you were with them on that?  Yes.  I remember that because I was an ONA fan from back in the day, from high school, when they  were on NAW, and I couldn't go to the promotional tour at the Hard Rock.  I had to work.  I had to send my girlfriend at the time, because they were giving Opie and Anthony t-shirts 
[03:46:00]  and stuff and making their big announcement.  It was a different girl?  It was a different girl.  So, where is she now?  I don't know.  She's still in New York, I'm assuming.  You think she regrets the breakup?  I'm sure she does.  Wouldn't you?  Can we reach out to her?  No, I wouldn't know how to contact her anymore.  I haven't spoken to her in six years.  Facebook her.  I'm like, why would I do that now?  Like, what kind of message does that send to an ex if after six years you friend her on  Facebook? 
[03:46:30]  No, just send her a message.  Kenny, I don't know if you know this or not about me.  Yeah.  But I'm not looking to hook up.  No, I know.  You got a very nice fiancée.  That's right.  Fiancée.  That's how you say it.  Fiancée.  Yeah.  But, so I had to send her, and then, obviously, I wasn't on the show until their first summer.  Actually, was Danny on the very first show, Eric?  Not that I recall.  I think he was there. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Was he in the building for the very first show?  Yeah, I believe the interns had started that first day.  Because we've run low on people who were here for the first show.  It used to be, like, everybody, the staff was here.  Were you at the first show, or did you start, didn't you start on the second show or something?  I was hired as of the fourth or whatever it was, but I think because back then we all  had, like, intern schedules.  Yeah.  So, I didn't technically start until, like, the third day.  Oh, so we're not going to talk to you until Friday.  I guess not.  I mean, you have nothing to contribute about today. 
[03:47:30]  Well, I remember listening at home.  Yeah, I mean, I listened at home, too.  And I was like, wow, I can't wait to go to work.  That's back when I hadn't bought XM Radio yet.  So, my first day of listening was actually the next day when I could get a little, you  know, illegal download of the show.  You illegally pirated this show.  That's right.  2004, I was Sam Roberts, internet pirate.  They're going to dock you.  Now?  Yeah.  Well, now that you've admitted it.  Oh, my God.  I was kidding.  I was joking. 
[03:48:00]  But Mars was there first day.  Probably.  And, Eric, obviously you were there first day.  Yes.  What was it like first day of this show?  Seven years ago today when Opie and Anthony returned to satellite radio.  And, by the way, this is obviously their longest run by far.  Seven years in a row.  Opie and Anthony are not used to this kind of thing.  What was the first day like, Eric?  Because I remember your first appearance.  Do you have your first appearance on the show?  Yeah.  By chance?  Yeah, I'll run it into you if it's on the disc here. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  Yeah, that first day, we all got there like between 4, 4.30 in the morning.  But all these DC engineers were still there through the night because they still did not  have everything ready to go.  Why?  It's been so it has been like that since day one.  Yeah, they were having connection issues.  The system that we used at the time was called Dillette.  And Dillette wasn't transferring back and forth between DC and New York.  So we weren't having commercial breaks and things like that.  Kenny, when was the promotional tour? 
[03:49:00]  Started at the end of August.  Okay.  It was in the summer, like August.  Yeah, so it was in the summer.  And so they were signed to XM in the summer and they couldn't between the summer and October  get the studio ready to go.  Like there were still last minute.  There were still people there that were trying to clear out that were using that studio.  Yeah, because like the old office.  Yeah.  Was God bless me.  There's a cough.  Oh.  The old office was like a conference room.  Oh, okay. 
[03:49:30]  You know, and they had to like switch things around.  Yeah, I know, but you'd think that they would have done that before the day.  Because I remember at the press conference at the Hard Rock.  Right.  It used to be on 57th Street.  Now it's on Broadway.  Right.  From the Hard Rock, they were all excited and took us down the street to the Steinway building.  And were Opie and Anthony excited at that time?  Yeah, they were excited about being excited.  Okay. 
[03:50:00]  Mars.  Yes, sir.  You were there seven years ago.  I was there from day one.  Seven years ago.  And the reason this shit didn't open up like, you know, was supposed to on time is because  people have some requests.  Last minute?  That's right.  A little last minute request.  What do you think?  Okay, well, I guess that, so not only has this been like that since day one, Opie and  Anthony have been like that since day one seven years ago.  A couple last minute requests.  Yeah, I'm right.  They didn't like, so there weren't a lot of practice shows before they went on? 
[03:50:30]  Oh, no.  No.  Okay.  Well, you know, the kind of requests that get made, especially, you know, with a new  studio or something, you might want some couches, you might want stands like with wheels and  platforms for your instant replay machines.  So you could start the show just lounging out, but then finish the show at the console.  Because, I mean, that happened like a thousand times.  It never panned out.  You know it's not going to.  What do you mean it never panned out?  It never.  They never did that once?  But, so, did you know the show before you started?  Seven years ago, when we started on Saturday.  Did you know Opie and Anthony's the show? 
[03:51:00]  No, you're not.  So you were just fresh-faced.  I gotta tell you.  He was in the army.  I had no idea.  You remember the Pickle Punk?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember that incident?  Yeah.  Well, you know, when I brought it about, people were asking me, well, don't you know about  the Pickle Punk?  No.  I don't even know about your fucking show.  Yeah.  Who the fuck are you talking to?  So then I found out.  Mars was in the army.  There's soldiers who listen to our show today.  Right.  But I was in, I didn't come directly from the army to start here.  To the show.  Right. 
[03:51:30]  I gotta tell you about the first time we met Mars.  He was a sergeant.  Look, let Iraq talk.  Put your headphones on if you're going to see.  There are none.  I just want to say congratulations to Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Seven years.  Mazel tov.  Mazel tov.  And thank you to all the faithful fans.  Thank you, Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  On Facebook.  Yeah, got it.  Eric.  What were you saying?  They had brought us down to D.C. for some kind of orientation thing for a couple days. 
[03:52:00]  And at one point, we're in this big conference room down in D.C. at XM.  And they're not ready to start yet.  But, you know, the staff at the time and Opant and Jim are all in this room.  And then there's this other guy sitting directly across from us, but further down at the corner.  And we have no idea who this guy is.  And they don't even introduce him to us until midway through the meeting going, oh, by the way, this is going to – this is Mars.  He's going to be your new engineer.  And Matt, again, we were all just staring at him like, who is this guy at the other side of the table? 
[03:52:30]  I was always –  So it was like, here are the guys for the show.  Guys, that's Mars over there.  And there's you.  Yeah.  Always, since day one.  Let's also give Mars a big round of applause for introducing us to Master Poe, who was responsible for that big hire.  I think that was very successful.  Okay.  Let's all give a good nice golf clap.  All right.  What are we, bringing up faults here?  Why?  I don't know.  If that's what we're doing.  You can do whatever you want. 
[03:53:00]  Okay.  I'll think of something real quick.  Not real quick.  You already missed that book.  Like thinking – like bringing guests to people's house so they could do grand larceny or larceny.  Okay.  Well, now we're moving completely off the topic.  Yes.  Thanks for that.  I will say, Danny –  You had nothing to do with it, though.  I did.  That's right.  It doesn't make any sense.  You didn't have anything to do with Paul either.  Your friends go stumbling.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Thankfully.  The only thing is that you hated him, so he hated you, so what?  Well –  And so did you.  I'm sorry?  And so did you.  I remember Danny –  You hated Danny? 
[03:53:30]  No, he hated Poe.  After a while, yeah.  Of course.  I have to admit, after a while, he got too much.  I remember one of the instances where Danny started hating Master Poe was, I guess, within  your first full week that you were working there.  All right.  Go on.  I think we might be talking about that.  The show's going on, and Poe pulls Danny out from that little side studio that we had  where the board was and the phone screener, to hand Danny a vacuum and said, you need  to vacuum the floor all the way out to the hallway.  There was a bunch of different instances. 
[03:54:00]  And Danny's like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Well, there was also the time that Poe wanted me to rewire the intercom.  Oh, right, right, right.  And there was the other time that Poe wanted me to hide his coaxial cables that were all  over the floor of his office.  And for some reason, he thought that what an internship meant was that these were slaves  that I could just use to do whatever I want with.  When, in the grand scheme of things, he's a fucking door watcher, and he thought that  he could just boss around interns who were supposed to be there learning the radio business.  Yeah, it's one thing when we have the interns, like, look, the glass here between two studios 
[03:54:30]  is dirty.  When did this become the Master Poe show?  Because everybody wants to talk about Poe.  Nobody knows who Master Poe is anymore.  There's a fuck about the seventh year anniversary of shit.  And Eric just keeps...  No, there's a thing about, you know, we have the interns, we'll clean the glass here in  the studio.  Who cares?  But Poe would ask the interns, here's some bugling, clean all the windows going outside  in, like, throughout the entire floor there, vacuum everything, empty out the garbage cans.  Master Poe was our security guy before Kenny.  I don't know why we're talking about him.  Because he's more fun to talk about. 
[03:55:00]  Because there was so many...  He was a character, like, in his own...  He was a legend in his own right.  You know what I mean?  Like, there were some just fascinating Poe stories.  Dude, let me tell you, I had one time I asked him to help me clean up some wires, right?  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, you know, people grab wires and probably lay them out.  So he stripped the copper off him and sold him.  Lay them out.  Or, you know, I didn't think that he would do this.  He takes the wire and he makes a figure eight, real small.  Now, we're talking about, like, 25 feet wires.  And he's bringing it down to about six inches of a figure eight. 
[03:55:30]  And it just ties it up real tight.  So he gives me a whole box of this shit.  He just ruins all my wires.  Because they're all bent up and not.  He's just like, no, Poe, no.  I wasn't here for the first three months.  Right.  But if Danny's talking about things that happened, like, on the first few days that Opie and Anthony were on satellite radio,  didn't you have to do something with feedback for Master Poe?  I don't know if that was a task that was assigned to me in particular.  But still an intern. 
[03:56:00]  I do recall somebody was directed to go through all of the instant feedback.  All of it.  Looking for potential threats.  He wanted you guys to highlight curse words.  Mars is laughing.  He took curse words as threats.  Because Mars was the guy who had someone.  You guys were in the same dojo or something, right?  That's right.  And then you recommended him.  I did.  And then you realized there's a mistake later.  Ah, that's a mistake.  In his respect, okay? 
[03:56:30]  Defense.  Thank you.  In his defense, his character, you know, needed a lot of help, you know?  Okay.  Yeah, his character.  The way he is.  Like his person.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got you.  His human character, not his radio character.  But as a person to tackle an enemy or whatever, that motherfucker's bad.  He was like having like a giant dog.  Like he was an animal.  Like, until they died.  Do you remember the Halloween party in Hard Rock? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  When a group of people stole supposedly someone's purse?  No, I didn't know that.  You guys really?  No, you.  I wasn't here for it.  It was the first Halloween party?  I wasn't here for it.  Halloween party.  So, here's an incident where someone loses their purse.  So, there was a group of gentlemen that normally don't, you know, they're not the demographics  of O&A.  Kids?  No.  Is it black people?  A bunch of Canadians.  You just say black people.  So, then.  They're black people.  You call them black people.  I think Martin's talking about black people. 
[03:57:30]  So, the assumption was.  He's being racist by avoiding it so much.  I know.  He's calling them Canadians.  What is that even?  What are we?  Eight?  It's black.  They're black.  Okay.  So, the assumption was that they were the culprits, right?  Because of their skin color?  I don't know.  A female pointing him out.  Okay.  Whatever happened.  Sure.  So, now this incident moves outside.  Now, you got a group of young blacks on one side of the street and some O&A guys,  rough and tough, and having a few drinks.  Oh, my God.  On the other side of the street. 
[03:58:00]  Now, this individual.  Rough and tough.  Big ass.  There was a couple of them.  I might call him roly-poly.  No, no, no.  You'd be surprised.  I don't know them as well as Master Poe does.  He was friends with him?  Oh, Master Poe was best friends with all of them.  Okay.  Best friends with him.  Keep going.  So, now the street is kind of divided, right?  Yeah.  One side is looking at the other side like, what are you going to do?  Sharks and the jets.  And this motherfucker Poe.  Okay?  Yeah.  This fucking guy.  And this is the animalistic part of it.  He sees a conflict, and he's got to throw himself in the middle of it because he may be 
[03:58:30]  able to hurt somebody.  He's got to save the world.  Yeah.  He's got to save O and A, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Even though there's no threat.  So, he gets in the middle of it all, and he starts talking to the black guys nicely,  respectfully.  Sure.  And he calms them down.  So, everything's over.  It's all good and said and done.  So, I go, Poe, what are you doing?  What about one of those individuals had a gun?  And this fucking guy's answer to me was, I'll do this.  Remember he had the long black coat? 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, like Neo in the Matrix.  That son of a bitch pulled out a whip.  I swear to God, bro.  A whip that he had laying across his arm, across his back, and to the other side, to the other  arm.  And he yanked it out, and he starts whipping.  What?  He said he would have took them on.  With a whip.  Yeah.  He told me.  I've heard somebody bringing a knife to a gunfight.  Poe wants to bring a whip to a gunfight.  He said they would have been saying, yes, sir.  Oh, my. 
[03:59:30]  Poe.  What type of talk is that?  But that's cool.  But he was for real.  Tell me this.  First day at the XM Studios.  Why was he for real, though?  Just because he had a whip?  I've known a bunch of douchebags who carry around weapons.  That doesn't mean that they're for real.  No.  That didn't make him for real.  So other incidents, he was really down to.  So then how come every video I've ever seen of him, he's just, like, flailing his limbs  about and smacking himself?  Well, I've seen one where he was down to fight.  I never saw him.  He was down to fight.  I've seen him a couple of times.  The only damage I've ever seen that motherfucker do was popping some fucking balloons on his 
[04:00:00]  steps of his shitty douche.  Danny.  Danny.  Look.  I don't defend them a lot, but I must defend them here.  In this respect, one time I'm walking down the street on 57th Street, right, with him,  you know, we walk in at 4 o'clock in the morning, shit like that.  Sure, dude.  Walk to work.  Watch what you need, though.  Oh, stand back.  Oh, let's have breakfast to get paid.  So we walk in up 57th Street from west side to the east side, and there was, like, on  between 6th and 7th, there's, like, a little hill, so you're looking down at who's coming  up.  And there's this brother, huge, huge brother, just, you could tell, fucking crazy, he's 
[04:00:30]  doing mannerisms.  Like the type of guy that somebody like me would go, oh, I'm going to walk on the other  side of the street.  That's what I did.  Right, okay.  I fucking move over to the other side.  Because even you could handle a problem, possibly, but avoid it.  Yeah.  Because it's not going to turn, even if you have to handle the problem, there was still  a problem.  Absolutely.  Plus, the individual's huge, and he's, you know.  So who knows?  Angry.  Yeah.  And possibly crazy.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  So here comes Poe. 
[04:01:00]  The dude does not move.  Poe doesn't.  Neither does the other guy.  I'm like, holy shit.  So I'm already walking on the street.  You left him.  Hey, I'm on the street.  No, I'm watching him.  Oh, but you walked around.  Right.  And these two guys, these two alpha males are fucking going at each other.  Two lunatic alpha males.  And let me tell you, lunatic number one, black dude, he moved.  He had to move, because Poe was not having it.  And then after we were done with that, I was like, yo, what are you doing?  He said, fuck that, I ain't moving for no fucking motherfucker.  Yeah.  I mean.  That was Poe.  No, he was ready. 
[04:01:30]  He was not joking.  He didn't have common sense, but he also, I mean, he didn't have the common sense to  not come at you full force.  So that's a positive in a way.  Full force all the time.  He did good things.  He carried people from lobbies to across the street when they were, you know, laid out  naked.  So he can carry people.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Go on, Rowan.  He's real.  Because a black guy stepped out of his way, and then he carried a drunk bitch across  57th Street.  Go on, Rowan.  I was, it's like the old sales guy, Will Chapman. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  We got wasted, and we called Poe.  We need help.  Oh, yeah.  And we sent him all over town.  He's, I'm in my car.  He'll always be there for you, though.  I'm in my car.  Why are you?  We go, help, help, downtown.  Tell me, though, Mars.  Yes.  It's your first day on 57th Street.  Yes.  And it's the first Opie and Anthony show.  What was your impression of the show?  Were you just an XM engineer, or did they hire you for that show?  They hired me specifically for the ONA show.  And what did you do before? 
[04:02:30]  Like, where did they, where did you?  Cupcap salesman.  I was, I engineered a commercial insertion company.  Okay.  I don't know what that is, but I don't care.  That's when they impregnate horses, I think.  Oh, I got it.  That's commercial insertion.  Did you see the commercials being played on TV?  That's another company insertion, making profit out of that, making it simpler for the cable  companies.  Okay, whatever it is.  I got it.  So, what was, what did you think of the show?  Of the show itself?  In the beginning.  Not now.  Not like, oh, I'm trying to get you to say something stupid.  In the beginning. 
[04:03:00]  In the beginning, I had, I had, I had my problems.  Because you didn't get it.  Uh, I got a lot of things.  Uh-huh.  A lot of things that I needed to build, uh, just.  Tolerance for.  Tolerance.  Just have crocodile skin.  And realize what it's done in fun.  We do it all.  Right.  Like, this is what we do.  At first, you know, I didn't understand this.  Never heard, you know, listen to Howard Stern or any shock jocks.  So, you didn't get it.  So, I wasn't getting the humor with the racial stuff and, you know, the kid touching. 
[04:03:30]  You didn't like that.  Especially with all the kid touching that went on in your family.  I didn't know, you know, that, that, you know, that should, yeah.  I had to, uh.  All of a sudden, it's his bread and butter, and he likes the show, though, right?  Exactly.  Yeah, I love this fucking show.  That's right.  Exactly.  Get it fucking right.  It pays the fucking mortgage.  So, I love the fucking show.  Yeah.  Did you get, did you get used?  What's wrong with that?  Did you get used to it and actually like the show?  Like, well, what's everything, Danny?  Come on, you're directing shit to me.  What's everything?  Well, isn't that kind of like sell-out-y?  How do you figure sell-out?  I'm just trying to answer your stupid question.  Because you didn't like the show, but because it gives you money in your pocket, now you 
[04:04:00]  love the show.  You know what it is, Danny?  What is it?  You're ignorant, bro.  I am?  So, I'm going to tell you in your face.  Okay, tell me.  Yeah, I'm going to tell you in your face.  Tell me about all my ignorance.  I'm just going to go ahead and provide you with the answer that you fucking want, all  right?  Go for it.  But the truth of the matter is that it does pay for the mortgage, right?  So, after I have my bills paid for, then I can think freely and accept shit.  Now, I like the show.  And there's people that are on the show that I like very much, just like there's people  on the show that I don't fucking like.  Yeah, who aren't there anymore?  Okay?  Who don't you like?  That's not a concern of yours. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, I would like to know what's up.  Who don't you like?  I have to...  I love Opie.  I love Danny and Jimmy.  You love Opie, Danny, and Jimmy?  You just said I love Opie, Danny, and Jimmy.  He's not the smartest, bro.  He's not the smartest guy.  You meant Anthony.  I meant Anthony.  Okay.  So, you got confused.  You love Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Yeah.  That's now you're talking...  There are staff members you like?  They're not...  And there are staff members you don't like?  Most of the staff members that I had issues with are not here.  Most, though.  Not all.  Well, there's a couple that have the good and bad days. 
[04:05:00]  We all do.  Right.  Right?  Right.  One day we're talking.  Right.  Next day you're not talking to me anymore type of shit, you know?  What do you mean?  You gotta get used to that kind of shit.  I don't know what you mean.  You know exactly what I mean.  Well, who doesn't talk to you?  That's not important.  Well, yes it is.  I'm just saying.  Are you talking about Danny?  One day we're cool and then all of a sudden we're not cool anymore?  Is he talking about you?  Probably.  Like, what the fuck is that?  He doesn't like to just come out and say what the deal is.  That's why he has to tiptoe around everything.  Yeah, but you think he is.  For some reason he thinks like radio is just stretching things out for as long as they can 
[04:05:30]  go.  Yeah.  No, no.  Me and Mars aren't talking.  The first time that we've talked to each other in probably six months is on this after  show.  How come you're not talking?  Why?  See?  Why?  Did you guys ever follow you?  Because, you know, there's enough times when you just, you can't, you just can't anymore  and you just go, fuck it.  It's not worth it to talk to this person no more.  I'm a better person with them, not in my life.  So I don't.  Was there any catalyst?  Um, just general attitudes.  You know what I mean?  He's giving you an attitude?  No, it's just like some people, they can't accept when, like, sometimes you just gotta 
[04:06:00]  admit when you're wrong and be like, oh, you know what?  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  But that never happens with Mars.  That's not true.  I say I'm wrong all the time because I'm wrong all the time.  Well, it didn't happen in that particular instance.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  He knows exactly what the fuck he's talking about.  So, no, no, no, no.  And it's not like, hang on.  You're talking bullshit in a round.  Be specific.  We directed the shit to you, not directed the shit to me.  Tell me what it is.  So, we had an issue with an Apple TV. 
[04:06:30]  And after that day, Mars decided he didn't want to talk to me anymore.  Oh my god, you're a petty little bitch.  I'm a petty bitch.  You're the one that stopped talking to me, dumb fuck.  I did not.  Yes, you did.  I did not.  You're a petty bitch.  You're the one that runs around getting motherfuckers fired.  You're a fucking asshole, buddy.  You're a douchebag.  Don't fucking run around here talking about, talking about, who fuck.  Let me tell you something about being a douchebag.  Fuck you and whoever the fuck you're trying to fucking.  Fuck you, buddy.  You're going to call me petty.  You're the one that fucking doesn't.  Let me finish.  You're the one that didn't talk to me, buddy.  You can come in and say hi to me whenever you want.  Anytime you want.  Let me finish. 
[04:07:00]  You know where I sit.  You think that I fucking hide behind those?  You know where I sit.  If you fuck with me, I would throw you under the bus.  Just like you do, motherfucker.  Just like you do in the fucking meetings.  Every time you bring up my...  Because you're in meetings, motherfucker?  You think that by bringing shit up in a meeting...  What do I bring up?  Be specific.  You want that to be specific?  Be specific.  Because there's been so many fucking incidents.  You can't.  You're a little fucking asshole.  It's so much.  All right, so are you.  Derek, that's what you want to bring up.  Everyone on the air.  Everyone on the air.  You're the one naming names.  Everybody remember who I'm on the air.  You want to be direct?  I'm direct, too. 
[04:07:30]  Fuck you.  You want to be an asshole and treat me like a fucking asshole?  No, you're an asshole because you're the one that fucking...  You're the one that decided...  All you can do is talk, Danny.  That's all you can do ever, ever.  Talk, talk, talk.  It's the radio.  What else?  Are we supposed to do it?  No, but what we're talking about is off air.  It has nothing to do with the fucking...  Yeah, off the air, you stop talking to me, motherfucker.  You decided that you didn't want to talk to me, so I didn't talk to you.  Danny, you must be crazy.  Don't call me petty on the air.  Fuck that.  I ain't having any.  You must be crazy because, bro, you look at me in my fucking face in the morning and  you don't say shit to me.  Why should I fucking talk to you?  You're the one that walked out in the hall when we had an argument, acted like a bitch. 
[04:08:00]  You acted like a bitch and you fucking...  You took your ball and left.  Why the fuck would I want to talk to someone like that?  Because you're a fucking idiot because I'm trying to tell you what the issue was and  you totally ignored what I was saying.  In the middle of talking to you, you fucking turned your face on me.  So what the fuck am I supposed to do?  Stand there and beg for your attention?  You're a piece of shit.  Fuck you.  You can fucking drop dead right now.  I don't give a fuck.  You're a piece of shit.  You can call me a piece of shit all you want.  I can call you a piece of shit.  I don't care.  It's never going to affect me that Mars called me a piece of shit. 
[04:08:30]  And the other thing about this too, the boss is here.  It doesn't affect our fucking job.  He still talks to me in reference to work and I still talk to him in reference to work.  So it has nothing to do with the show.  But personally, you can suck balls and die, motherfucker.  I wouldn't shed any tears.  And I will say, that fight just now was brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms, Trojan America's  number one most trusted condom brand.  Yeah, right.  Everybody fucking loves you, Danny.  Think about that shit, right?  What the fuck are you talking about?  I love you in this fucking company, right? 
[04:09:00]  Everybody hates me.  And they hate you too.  You think so?  Probably.  Yeah, you fucking want to make it that way.  That ain't true.  Whatever.  You're just making shit up.  Just like you do.  It didn't talk shit all the time.  You make shit up.  I don't work.  Motherfucker, I work more than you, motherfucker.  What the fuck do you do?  What are you doing right now, fuckface?  What did I do for this fucking show?  What did I just do just now before I walked in here?  What did you just do?  Get paid for an hour?  Before I walked in here.  Doing what?  What did you just do for the fucking company for the last hour besides just hang out doing nothing  on this fucking show?  On this show?  What did I do for the past hour, you stupid fuck?  I just changed the fader in Studio 7 that was giving them a fucking problem. 
[04:09:30]  You just asked me what the fuck I did.  This is a fucking asshole.  How come every time the show needs you for something, you're never around?  When did they need me, fucking asshole?  I don't know.  Every day.  When did they need me?  Where's Mars?  I don't know.  I called them four times.  I don't know.  I guess he'll get to it when he gets to it.  See, Danny?  You're a fucking liar.  That's not lying.  You're a fucking liar.  That's never a lie.  Who called me?  That's never a lie.  Who called me?  I never called you.  I never said it was today, fuckface.  So when was the last time someone called me and I wasn't there for them?  I don't know.  Probably like last week or two weeks ago.  I don't know.  Name the incident. 
[04:10:00]  Mars, and you know what's happened before.  Danny, you're full of shit, Danny.  You just want to say that.  Whatever, man.  I'm not going to let it bother me.  You know, yeah, exactly.  It doesn't bother me either.  You come on the air.  You throw jabs all the time.  He sounds more bothered.  I will say this.  Dan, you know what it is who's out in the open now?  I don't fucking like you.  I don't care, Mars.  Because you're a fucking little prick.  And yo, let me tell you, man.  I don't care.  As a man, you ain't shit, bro.  You're a fucking little piece of...  You're nothing, man.  Cool.  You don't even act like a man.  I'm telling you right now, you don't...  Because we spent so much time together.  And we don't have to fight.  And we don't have to fight to prove to each other that we're men. 
[04:10:30]  We can fucking deal with one another intellectually, civilly, okay?  And not fucking...  You're not a fucking man.  You're a little fucking worm.  I don't know what that means.  You squirm.  You fucking...  How do I squirm?  You go behind people's back.  You throw names.  Go behind people's back.  Holy shit, Mars.  No, I'm direct.  Holy shit, Mars.  Ask me any question.  Go ahead.  I'm not trying to cut anybody off.  Go ahead.  And Danny, I'm not...  You know I'm not trying to cut you or Mars off.  Because I would let this go on forever.  I know.  But we do have... 
[04:11:00]  It's time to...  I never had a plan to keep a job here.  And I never got anyone fired.  Bye-bye.  Hey, secret shirt of the future.com, baby.  Nobody begged.  See?  You just look at you.  Making shit up.  Making shit up.  Just because I tell you...  Right here.  I'm right here.  Yeah, nobody begged.  What are you talking about?  Nobody begged.  Now you know.  No, you're full of shit.  You just say shit up in the air like that.  And it's not true.  You have no substance behind what you just said.  All right, we'll continue.  Go engineer something.  We'll continue this when we can.  Mars, we got to cut it off.  Okay.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.
