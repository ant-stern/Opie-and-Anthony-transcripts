<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically vulgar introductions and a description of a strangely dressed, foul-smelling individual they encountered, speculating he might be a guest for Howard Stern.  Anthony then showcased a comedic Vine video he made, a self-directed running gun battle using After Effects, sparking discussion about potential future installments.  A lengthy segment focused on a JCPenney teapot resembling Hitler, exploring potential public outrage and JCPenney's response, transitioning into a discussion about retail pricing tactics. Opie detailed a humorous and sexually suggestive visit to his dermatologist, which led to conversations about skin cancer, flea bites, and the high cost of dermatological procedures, with a caller sharing a similar experience.  The show then shifted to Alanis Morissette’s music, her alleged overuse of the letter "S," and her career, expanding into a discussion of 90s female musicians, including Lilith Fair artists and Beth Hart, reminiscing about their past appearances on the show.

A significant portion covered Amanda Bynes' erratic public behavior and Twitter feuds, especially her conflict with Courtney Love, including her comments about Rihanna and Chris Brown, her legal troubles, Gucci Mane's opinion, and her drastically changed appearance due to plastic surgery.  The hosts briefly discussed Justin Bieber's reckless driving and reiterated their desire to have Amanda Bynes on the show.  Throughout this section, the hosts employed frequent vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.

The next segment began by discussing the mental health struggles of former sex symbols like Britney Spears and Amanda Bynes, speculating about the link between aging, perceived irrelevance, and mental health decline.  They promoted Jim Norton's upcoming advice show with Bailey J and their podcast, mentioning interviews with Jeffrey Tambor, Mick Foley, and Annie Letterman, along with segments on Lady Di, Bernie Goetz, and a Jimmy Dean sausage bit.  They discussed a funny "NTM" bit from *The Wizard of Oz* and Anthony's Broadway experiences, focusing on his attempts to have sex.  The conversation then shifted to the *Rocky* Broadway musical, Lucinda Williams' music, Nine Inch Nails' tour and album, and Trent Reznor's Oscar win, comparing him to Danny Elfman.  Obama's athleticism (or lack thereof), weight loss, and Christie's weight were discussed, followed by commentary on gun control legislation and media coverage of black-on-black crime.

A substantial portion detailed the graphic specifics of Kermit Gosnell's late-term abortion practices, prompting discussion of abortion laws and differing perspectives.  The Zimmerman trial and the judge's decision on Trayvon Martin's text messages were also discussed, with the hosts expressing their belief that it was a "slam dunk" for Zimmerman's self-defense. The unusual appearance of the judge was humorously compared to Amanda Bynes.  Further news items covered Eric Holder's perceived racial bias, an assault on a white family in a black neighborhood, the IRS targeting conservative groups, and a Miss Universe Canada blunder.  Bill Burr's appearances and Maria Menounos' scheduled visit were announced. A funny voicemail from a Papa John's driver who accidentally butt-dialed a customer after insulting him was played, followed by an interview with Bill Burr.

The Bill Burr segment began with Burr discussing his intense weight loss and gym routine, particularly his pull-up regimen, and a bet with Paul Versi.  The conversation evolved into discussions of workout techniques, presidents' physical appearances, and sexually suggestive and crude jokes about the sexual lives of past presidents.  A picture of Ronald Reagan in sweatpants on Air Force One was shown.  The discussion shifted to the banking system, sparked by a video of a young Canadian girl's speech about Canada's national debt, with Burr relating it to his mortgage and insurance experiences.  They debated the banking system with strong language,  touched upon conspiracy theories (moon landing, Boston Marathon bombing), and referenced Joe Rogan's views.  Maria Menounos joined, briefly discussing her new movie, "Adventures of Cereal Buddies," a darkly comedic road trip thriller.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the movie, Burr's college experience, and Menounos' career.

The Maria Menounos segment detailed her career, Hollywood experiences, childhood anecdotes, overcoming a Boston accent, challenging classmates, her friendship with Bob Backlund, and her experience being booed at his WWE Hall of Fame induction.  She discussed online harassment and her methods for handling it.  Listener calls covered family members struggling with addiction, quitting a job, a girlfriend's shortness of breath during sex, and unwanted touching.  Menounos and Bailey Jay (also present) shared their perspectives, and Bailey Jay discussed her experience in the adult film industry.  There was a brief mention of Bill Burr’s upcoming appearance, and the segment ended with plugs for Menounos's movie, podcast, and advice show.  The discussion involved crude humor, offensive language, and sexually explicit content.

The final segment featured several callers.  One discussed a positive experience with an escort service from "Erotic Review," another described his girlfriend's shortness of breath during doggy style sex (Dr. Steve attributed it to "truncal obesity" and suggested solutions), a caller shared finding what seemed to be a suicide note in a co-worker's truck, another confessed guilt after a casual sexual encounter, and a final caller sought advice on breast implants for his wife.  Bailey Jay and Jim Norton discussed the importance of finding a skilled surgeon for breast implants.  Dr. Steve provided his email address, "weirdmedicinexm@gmail.com," for inquiries.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey yo.  What's up out there?  Ice kill.  Time in ice eat.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen. 
[00:03:30]  Out there.  Ice kill.  I mean, I see it.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die. 
[00:04:30]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  My nipple worked kind of hard.  Kind of hard.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Let's get the show on the road.  And let's do that. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning, everybody.  Oh, how are we, everybody?  Oops.  Sorry, people.  There's someone walking around the hallways that smells like shit.  Literally?  Yes.  Yes.  It smells like duty.  Yes.  Shit and urine.  Ew.  That's like the return of Tippi Tom.  I think it's someone that's going to be on Howard's show.  I'll give him a plug today.  Yeah, I don't know.  Me and Kenny walked in, and there was a guy that was covering his entire face.  Yeah?  It was creepy. 
[00:05:30]  Like, with his hands?  No, he had a fucking scarf on or something, covering his entire face.  Yeah?  And Ronnie the limo driver was at the front door.  I go, what the hell is that about?  And it turns out he had to wait for the guy to come through security.  Oh.  I was bonding with Ronnie the limo driver, but it turns out it's a guy, I think, for Howard's show.  Oh.  So then I went into the bathroom just before.  Remember when I said I got to take a quick leak?  Yeah.  I went in there, and he doesn't have the scarf on anymore.  Yeah.  And he's changing it to something. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  And he smells like shit.  You think he's a homeless guy?  And the worst urine smell you've ever smelled.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  If anyone knows, let me know.  I don't know.  He was very, very strange.  You know?  And smelled horrendous.  You're here?  Yeah.  I'm here.  Yeah.  Foggy day in New York City.  Stunt brain chickening.  Why?  Why?  Apparently, he likes my little, my Vine video. 
[00:06:30]  Oh.  What's your Vine video?  I'm hearing things about this Vine video.  Well, everyone's got to find their niche.  I think mine's going to be running gun battles in my house.  Because that one, I don't know.  You've got to find your niche, your six-second niche, like Jim did with Chip.  Who?  Oh, Chip did it.  I had nothing to do with that.  Yeah, Jimmy has nothing to do with the Chip shit.  That's Chip.  Yeah, I've just been finding a...  You're finding a niche?  A niche.  Because I'm sick of Vine with everyone just going... 
[00:07:00]  The thing I have to figure out...  Do you think the tone changes are a little...  Oh, my God.  That's the average Vine video right there.  But certainly, Chip has found his niche.  Chip has.  I've got to figure out a way to put these Vine videos up without having to record them on my laptop from my phone.  You can't just pump in, you know, a video.  It's got to be taken by your phone.  But these are videos that need a little bit of production. 
[00:07:30]  So it just...  Whoa.  Holy shit.  This is cool.  Running gun battle.  Wait a minute.  Let's turn this up here.  Oh.  It looks like I'm shooting with myself.  It's all...  Oh, did you do that downstairs?  After...  No, it's After Effects.  I did it upstairs, but I was able to split the screen, have me come in to the side of the frame with a gun, shoot it myself, miss. 
[00:08:00]  I turn around, pull out another gun, and now I shoot me with three rounds.  But on Vine, if you don't...  It goes right up when you do it.  Yeah, but I'm only filming my laptop with the Vine.  Oh, did you do that?  Oh.  Oh, smart.  Yeah, yeah, because I can't do it just from Vine.  That's just it.  I can only do it from the laptop screen.  Okay.  Yeah, but you figured it out. 
[00:08:30]  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, why not?  So you can put some effects on your Vine video.  Let me get the screen out of there.  Let me get the keyboard out.  I thought it was kind of a weird little niche-y thing.  That's cool, man.  Leave the keyboard in there.  Anthony, cool me on Twitter to check out the Vine video.  That was very good.  I just shoot myself like that.  But, you know, I have a running gun battle with myself around the house.  And then you get to use different guns and show off your arsenal.  Exactly.  Exactly.  What do you got?  Like four or five guns over there?  Ah, four or five times ten.  Ten, sure.  Plus 20. 
[00:09:00]  You should wear a hat in one, though.  Oh, a hat.  This way it looks like two different guys.  I shit, well, yeah.  But the object is to look exactly the same.  That's kind of silly.  That's the part.  Yeah.  That's what he was going for.  That's just ruined it.  Doesn't want it to be two different people, actually.  Although I could have maybe a wool hat on, do something, and then take the hat off, and  it's like, ah, shit, it's me.  Why don't you have, like, evil Anthony and regular Anthony?  Goatee, mustache, beret.  Why don't we do that?  Yes.  Yes.  Did you get the Hitler teapot yet? 
[00:09:30]  I haven't gotten the Hitler teapot.  What's wrong with you?  That thing looks great.  You're slacking.  J.C. Penney, I guess, has billboards out with a Hitler teapot being advertised.  Oh, wait, you got more than one of these?  That's just me creeping in.  That's the prelude.  Oh.  See, nothing happens, and then the thrilling conclusion is the gun battle.  Wait, you know what you have to do now, because now you got the dead guy.  Now you got to drag him out of the room.  All right, that's a little hard to do.  Well, you just got to get a body double.  Oh, yeah, so it's just seeing the legs.  I'm wearing the clothes you're wearing, and yeah.  That's a pretty good idea.  Well, if you're going to make this into a series. 
[00:10:00]  A little series.  We need to know what happened to the guy.  Yeah.  An action movie, six seconds at a time.  Yeah, we need to know what happened to the Anthony Cumia that just got shot.  It's five hours long.  Are you carrying someone over your shoulder in the exact same outfit?  Yes, let's do that.  Right.  You got to keep it going.  I know.  We could hire a small child.  We could just hire someone who looks like you to carry you, actually.  A midget.  This JCPenney thing, I'll tell you right now, I think this was by accident. 
[00:10:30]  You think it was an accident?  But now they're going to go all in.  JCPenney has a teapot that looks just like a Hitler caricature, I guess.  Looks like a Hitler giving his little Heil Hitler salute.  Right.  It's got the little nub that you take the lid off with is his mustache.  The handle, the big handle is the outline of his hair, and it actually has that swooping piece of his hair in there.  Because you make the handle nice and thick over there, so you can grip it nice.  The spout is his hand going up, going Heil Hitler. 
[00:11:00]  And then it looks like he's wearing a little tie.  Yeah.  And when you see it, you can't not see it now when you look at it.  Oh, God.  It looks like a Hitler?  Yeah, all you see is Hitler.  JCPenney is going to sell a shitload of these unless they panic and go, oh, my God, we can't sell these.  Oh, yeah.  They go with a Stalin teapot instead.  What do you think happens?  It's killed a lot of people, too.  Because this is going to be all over the place.  I think they, yeah.  I mean, it's sort of all over the place, but I mean, like, it's going to be all over mainstream news today. 
[00:11:30]  You think JCPenney backs down and says, oh, God, we got to get these off the shelves?  Or do they say, fuck it?  How could they fucking take the hit like that?  I think they leave it.  They just leave it?  Unless you're looking at it at that angle.  Right.  It doesn't look like.  That's what they should do.  Now look what we do.  You turn it this way, it's nothing.  It's a teapot.  It's a teapot, idiots.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they won't.  I'm a little teapot.  Did you get a German guy to sing this song? 
[00:12:00]  I'm a little teapot, short and stout.  Here's my handle.  I'm a kraut.  Here's my handle, and the rest of your things will meet you at the camp.  JCPenney.  Who shots at JCPenney?  I don't even know.  Do we even have him anymore around here?  My first credit cards, I think, was JCPenney.  Yeah, no kidding.  They go way back.  They screwed up, I guess.  Their whole campaign for the past couple of years has been no sales. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Like they're like, oh, yeah, our prices are just naturally low now.  We lower all our prices.  We do away with all those gimmicky sales.  Right.  And you come in and save money.  Right.  Well, the American people said, fuck that.  They want to hear that there's a sale.  Of course.  You can't change the mindset of the average shopper in America.  They want to see sales.  It has nothing to do with the price.  You could jack the price up, say there's a sale, and people will show up for the sale,  even though the price is not lower at all. 
[00:13:00]  When I go clothes shopping every once in a while, obviously, and all of a sudden they go, oh, good news.  This is on sale, 75% off.  Oh, this is 80% off.  Oh, I'm saving all kinds of money.  But you're not.  I can't afford not to buy it.  That's how much this shit should cost, and they're still making money off the fact that  it's 75, 80% off.  Well, they realized that and went back to the whole sales thing.  They took such a fucking hit on sales and just the fact that they had to then get rid of 
[00:13:30]  all their promotional items that said no sales.  It's all bullshit.  Yeah.  Somebody head rolled on that one.  I shop at the same couple places, and a T-shirt that they're pushing for $120, let's say.  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, fall hits, and it's on the discount rack for $15.  You're like, really?  Yeah.  So, obviously, the shirt really costs about $15, and you're making money off it. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  That's such a scam, the whole fucking thing.  Yeah, it really is.  The clothing industry like that, when you go into a place, there's no way something costs  $200, and it's marked down to $28.  Yeah, of course.  Just stop it.  And even at $28, they're making some good money off that.  Yeah.  Really fast.  I went to the skin doctor yesterday again.  Come on, really fast.  Go.  I went to the skin doctor.  And I thank Tom Chiasano every time I go, because Mr. Chiasano had some brutal skin cancer. 
[00:14:30]  He was in stage, holy fuck, I'm going to die.  Yikes.  Stage four?  He was deep into skin cancer, and he made it.  This guy made it, our old GM at K-Rock.  And he was the one, many years ago, he said, look, fair skin, you fucking grew up on a golf course.  That's what he did.  In Waiting River at your grandma's beach house.  So I started getting my skin checked because of him.  And you get these pre-pre skin cancers.  Oh, boy.  That they just fucking zap off. 
[00:15:00]  I was actually thinking of you on the elevator on the way up.  I'm like, I got to go to his lady.  Yeah.  And I went yesterday, and she's hot.  She's cool.  Hot and cool?  You get to be naked in front of her.  Nice.  This is a nice little.  You get to jack off.  It's a nice little perk.  I had this mark, and then when she looks under your scrotum, you just take the helmet and slap her cheek with it.  I talked about her, it seemed like yesterday, but it's six months already.  The robes are really soft, so you can just poke at it a little bit. 
[00:15:30]  You want to just fluff just a little.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  You don't want, like, crazy presentation, but you don't want it to look sad.  But you don't want it plumping up too much, and you never want it twitching.  No.  I'm not looking for anything, but you still got to fucking fluff it up a little bit.  Fluff it up.  After all, my man.  Right.  I poked at it.  Got to be proud.  I just poked at it through the bathrobe, and it did its job.  Very nice.  She asked about the family just as she's checking my junk. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  I think that's her way of making everyone in the room comfortable.  And it takes away any of that.  Don't think this is anything but professional.  Of course.  How's the family?  Of course.  Yeah.  No, she loves the whole family, too.  But then I tweet about it, and it is the truth, because someone goes,  That didn't happen.  That didn't happen.  These guys out there.  I don't need to make up shit for Twitter. 
[00:16:30]  Trust me.  But one asshole, that didn't happen.  Stop lying.  And as soon as she closed the door, after checking my entire body,  I hear her laughing in the hall.  Uh-oh.  So I'm like, what the fuck is she laughing at?  Oh, boy.  What the fuck is she laughing at?  They're probably not cancers.  They're probably just like little fucking little hairs.  But I'm like, that is like mortifying.  Yeah, she just licked at your dick, and now she's laughing. 
[00:17:00]  She's like, all right, well, we're going in the other room to zap some shit off.  And then she closes the door, and immediately I hear laughter in the hallway.  Yeah.  What is that?  I'll never know, because I couldn't ask.  What would you do if you heard the door close, then you heard her mumble?  I just need that thing in my mouth.  She's like, bust in naked, she's holding a Jolly Rancher.  Yeah.  It's delicious.  So what do they do?  They just fucking laser them off, or she cuts them?  Let's see.  She zapped a couple things on my nose.  You probably noticed that.  Yeah, a little smager. 
[00:17:30]  I got a little white spot, and then I got a purple thing over here.  She said it'll turn purple.  And then I got two things that she kind of scraped a little bit.  And I have a little skin tag here, which is kind of cute.  Oh, she loves skin tags.  Oh, she does, right?  She loves skin tags and moles.  Skin tags are...  I got rid of all my fucking...  I used to have moles all over the fucking place.  You can nail clipper to one of those.  That's pretty much what they do.  I did for like...  I had like one forever on the side of my neck. 
[00:18:00]  You have a giant one with a hat under it.  Let's get a hacksaw.  Oh.  God damn it.  Jimmy.  You took off your own skin tag.  Yeah, it was one like fucking years ago.  Did it bleed?  Not any more than anything else would have.  Good for you.  I just...  Because let me tell you.  Nicked it right off, and then I had everything waiting right there on the counter.  Right.  Like I had a cotton ball soaked with alcohol.  Good for you.  And I went...  And then slapped it against my neck.  Did it hurt? 
[00:18:30]  And then I took a hot piece of iron and I slapped it out of my neck.  Did it hurt?  No, not at all.  So you saved yourself about $1,200.  Really?  I spent $1,200 yesterday.  Oh, man.  On a checkup and a couple little things to be zapped and burned off.  That was about...  Probably over 10 years ago.  $1,200.  Not covered by insurance, by the way.  How are they not...  Those pre-cancer shit not covered?  That's safe insurance and fucking money.  I guess they'll throw it in the lab, and maybe I'll save a few bucks.  I don't know.  But she's the best.  So does she do stuff like skin rejuvenation? 
[00:19:00]  She knows how to check your body.  Yeah, she'll do all that shit.  All right.  You can go as deep as you want.  I don't go...  I don't...  I don't go deep.  No.  No.  Deep.  Well, I think she does the Botox and all that shit.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I don't want that.  I said, come in here.  Oh, boy.  Hi.  Oh, that...  Hi.  That would be too much.  Hi.  Just your face not moving.  That's my Botox face impression.  Hi.  You get the chin implant. 
[00:19:30]  Hi.  And the cheek implants.  What?  I didn't get it.  Does it look like Lee?  I didn't get anything, Don.  What?  Oh, your lips so big.  Right.  Hello.  I'll give her...  I'll give you...  Yeah, yeah.  I want that.  I think that on the elevator.  Just don't get a boner if I fucking, you know...  I'd love to.  She'd probably be like, tell him to come back.  Oh.  That guy's thicker than he looks.  You know that guy that you referred to me?  He had a raging heart on while I was checking for skin tags. 
[00:20:00]  No, here's what she'd say.  Something happened.  And then I'd finally confess to you that she was checking by my ankle.  And I just came on her forearm by mistake.  Just shot.  I did all right yesterday.  I have a little athlete's foot.  She had a point out.  And I had some pimples on my leg.  And she asked if I needed something for that.  I'm like, no.  I just...  I had a weekend when my brothers were sweating a lot.  I'm sure the fucking pimples would go away on their own.  Sure, they weren't bed bug bites? 
[00:20:30]  No, they're just fucking nothings.  Little nothings.  You need some proactive.  Yeah.  You need some proactive.  And then I shaved my arms down once a year.  I don't know why I'm confessing all this shit.  Jeez.  And because I get really fucking hairy arms.  And I got all these like flea bite scars from when I was living in Buffalo.  And I was infested by fleas by this stupid cat I brought in.  And I think I told a story over the years.  It drove me almost insane.  Every once in a while, a new flea bite would pop up. 
[00:21:00]  And there...  I don't know if you've ever gotten...  Have you ever gotten bitten by fleas?  Fuck yeah.  They fucking hurt.  And they itch.  And it takes forever to go away.  So every time you get a new one, you know you're in misery for, I don't know, close to a week.  Yeah.  And then that one would heal.  And then two more would pop up.  This went on forever.  And I bombed my apartment in Buffalo trying to get rid of the fleas.  And I fucking took care of the cat.  And they just kept on coming.  So when I shaved my arm, and before it starts growing back to look almost normal, you could see all the flea bite scars. 
[00:21:30]  And so I had to point that out to her.  And she goes...  And she's a skin doctor.  She goes, yeah, I was wondering what those were.  Just scratching the shit out of them.  Years ago.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  I just did damage.  Terrible.  Because you gotta scratch them.  It's awful.  You know what a flea bite feels like, right?  What is that?  The lame-o ex-wife.  Four fucking cats.  Right.  In this cottage house we were renting that was out back from another house. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  So it was in the middle of the woods.  Yeah.  And the fleas that were in this fucking house.  You'd wear white socks and walk around the house.  And there were black specks all over the white socks.  And there were fleas.  Right.  And they'd be on your legs.  It was awful.  And you could see them.  Yes.  You could see them jumping on your body and stuff.  Yes.  That's how many I had in Buffalo.  Oh, it was so itchy.  I'm itching right now.  That shit makes you itch.  But why?  Why is it a dumb little flea bite will drive you crazy?  Because they do the same thing as a skeeter. 
[00:22:30]  They got like little venom shit in them.  Right.  Yeah.  So how do you take...  Well, I...  You're like allergic to their little fucking anticoagulant that they put in you to fucking  suck your blood.  It's miserable, man.  It's terrible.  I don't miss that.  Well, who does?  Who does miss flea bites?  Ah, the good old days of the flea bite.  Well, I knew this was going to happen.  Charlie in Long Island.  Go ahead, Charlie.  Hi, Ope.  Hey, Charlie.  I was there on Tuesday.  Smithtown.  My dermatologist. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  $25 copayment.  Three tags removed.  $10 each.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's probably one of the best guys on the island.  I might be going to the wrong doctor, but she's going to look at it.  What, did she not accept her insurance?  And she was on Oprah once, so...  Oh!  She does skincare for fucking...  The stars?  ...one of those big companies.  And she flies to Paris.  Maybe I'm with the wrong doctor.  But did she not accept insurance?  I had a Lola in 2005, and he checks me out every six months, and...  Yeah, I got to, like, submit it myself, and half the time I don't, because I'm... 
[00:23:30]  How Bob do that shit, man?  I'm too lazy.  Yeah.  Oh.  So it just sits there.  I know I could probably get some money back.  I'm going to submit this one.  $1,200 is a lot of fucking money.  Yeah, man.  My therapist, I tried to do, but they said it left you...  If you're out of network, you're zero percentage off.  Because I was like, well, how about I may get, like, 10 or 20 or whatever.  Yeah, nothing.  I thought Obama was taking care of all this.  Oh, boy.  That'll happen.  Thanks, Charlie.  Obama and the IRS, you know, turning the IRS.  Yes, loose on the health care system is a great idea. 
[00:24:00]  Them having access to your health records and whatnot.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because they're real honest people over there in the Internal Revenue Service.  Oh, boy.  So that was kind of my day yesterday, dealing with the skin doctor.  And then getting caught in the rain in Central Park, just sitting there by myself.  It was nice.  Sounds like a rom-com.  It was awesome.  It was awesome.  There was no one in Central Park, and I got caught, so I just got some cover and just  fucking hung out. 
[00:24:30]  Ducked inside.  Oh, it was awesome.  No one answered to.  Just watching the rain.  It was weird.  I was just going to say, you know what seems to be, like, your goal these days?  Alone time.  I like alone time.  Time for Opie.  Well, we've been in the public eye for a really long time, so when you get that time to yourself,  it's really nice.  Especially living in New York, because living in New York, you can't go anywhere without  a dummy 10 feet from you.  Yeah.  Try it someday.  Just in this room.  Right. 
[00:25:00]  It's impossible.  But yesterday, because of the rain, there was nobody around.  Yeah.  It felt like it was in the middle of the Adirondacks or something.  Ooh, it's nice.  Someone leave a cake out.  That really wasn't a lot.  That was a terrible joke.  Oh, it was a joke?  You gave it a try.  You went, huh.  Well, I took a picture of a bride, and the title was, Isn't It Ironic?  Because it was raining.  Don't you think. 
[00:25:30]  Don't you think.  Yeah, so you figured it out.  I was listening to it a little.  And then a guy has to write, oh, you like quoting Alanis Morris?  I said, hey.  No, I don't like doing it.  But at that moment, it made sense, you idiot.  I was listening to a little Alanis on the way in because my.  And by the way, her shit is catchy.  Sorry.  There's no one's going to say, you know, shit wasn't catchy.  But my truck is getting new brakes.  I go through a lot of brakes on my truck. 
[00:26:00]  Because I drive very erratically in the city.  Because I continue to cut the lines.  And you haven't figured it out yet.  Damn it.  So I had to take Angela's car in.  And I don't like fucking with people's radios and shit like that.  So I just left it on.  It was on lithium.  Right.  And Alanis was on.  And she really was.  You think she was going for a gimmick thing with those S's?  Oh.  When she sings.  Thank you, Innocence. 
[00:26:30]  Thank you, Innocence.  Thank you.  Wait, we got to hear it now.  She really fucking emphasized her essence.  Really?  I never noticed.  I hope it's obvious.  It's every song.  It's every song.  Oh, then she wasn't trying to do it.  No.  No.  I think she was.  She probably has a little.  I'm getting off of these antibiotics.  How about stopping eating when I'm full of love? 
[00:27:00]  This is pretty gay.  How about them transparent dangling carrots?  Oh.  Such a dying.  How about that ever elusive good owl?  This is a possessive.  Thank you, India.  And thank you, terror. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you, sir.  Oh.  Wow.  I never noticed that before.  Thank you, frailty.  Thank you, consequence.  Thank you.  A lot of S there.  She's heavy on the S.  I liked this bitch.  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  It was a little fruity for a man.  Right.  But, you know.  Hey, catchy is catchy.  What can I tell you?  During that sensitive grunge period of the 90s.  Hey, let's do a 90s grunge break. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, man.  E-Rock, have we done that break in the last two days?  Pearl Jam, Nirvana.  Yeah.  I ran into one of my friends yesterday.  Oh.  And she was listening to some 90s grunge rock.  Yeah.  Taking her way back.  Lithium?  And then, of course, she has to say to me, you know, when I, when I, that, this brings  me back to when I was a kid and I was listening to you guys.  I love that part.  She goes, all the boys loved you and Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, didn't they?  I'm like, when you were a kid?  Oh, yeah.  This girl's 30.  Oh, man.  She's 30.  She's telling me when, when I was a kid and when I was listening to you guys.  People that listen to us that are 30 now were just fresh teenagers.  13, 14, shit like that.  No.  What?  No.  Really?  Well, how old?  11.  11?  When we started.  Oh.  The 30-year-olds were 11 when we started doing radio. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  We're 19 years in, brother.  Oh, my God.  Trying to make it to 20.  We'll see.  Why did I keep saying that?  I told you that I'm right.  See?  All right, man.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes we don't get along.  Duh.  You idiots.  We've been at this a long time.  Right now, we're in a getting along period.  So enjoy it.  Jesus.  Before it turns ugly. 
[00:29:30]  I'm so past any ugliness.  I'm kidding.  No, I mean, I'm just so fucking past it.  That was even a joke.  See?  But, yeah.  I mean, yeah, the fact is, you know, it's been a long haul.  Most of the time we've gotten along, though, is the reality.  Man.  Alanis is now very fat.  Look at photos.  Yeah.  She is?  Yeah.  Saw a picture of her, I guess, on the beach or something.  Who's she with these days?  Who's she married to?  Wasn't she married to someone famous? 
[00:30:00]  Or am I thinking of somebody else?  Well, she wrote that song for that guy.  For Dave Coulier.  Is that true?  Oh, what the fuck?  Is that true?  Did she write that song for him?  Or at least, maybe I don't know.  I know people like saying it.  It is, right?  Is it really true?  Is that the one whose dick she sucked in the theater?  Yeah.  But there's no...  You did Scooby-Doo while I sucked your dick in the theater.  There's no evidence at all. 
[00:30:30]  Not one picture of them together.  Oh, I don't know that.  I don't know.  I love this stupid song.  Is this the original?  Huh?  Is this not the original, is it?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  We've got a one name  And when she's had your baby  I'm sure she can make her  And the ex-and-a-mother  Cause the love that you gave me  We made wasn't able to make her  See, it's a little frumpy.  She's a frump.  Yeah, we're looking at fat pictures of her.  What years was she big?  Like, 95, 96? 
[00:31:00]  We were in Boston, so 90...  What'd you say?  95, 96?  Yeah, that's about right.  Maybe 96, 97?  Somewhere in there.  Yeah, 94.  Is when this album kept...  94?  I'm pretty sure.  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  When did Bit Her Little Pill come out?  Jacket Little Pill.  It's Bit Her Little Pill  And she turned into Jacket Little Pill.  This single was released July 95.  Oh, 95.  95.  I remember me and Florentine  Were doing those couch potato pilots  and one of her records was really... 
[00:31:30]  What's the one where she was  standing there naked  with the fucking smudge  on the video  and looked like her pussy and tits were...  Right.  Like, they were kind of...  Hand in pocket, maybe?  I don't know.  It might have been that it's ironic,  but I remember that's when  me and Jim were doing those couch potato...  Why are we talking about Alanis Morissette?  But it works, I guess.  Oh, because you heard the S's.  Yeah, I heard the S's.  Is she not popular?  I mean, she...  She kind of fell off.  She did.  Which is pretty amazing. 
[00:32:00]  20 years.  This album was just great.  Huge album.  This was a massive album.  There are like those 90s chicks  that just...  Chicks in the 90s, you know,  Fiona Apple.  Fiona?  She was pretty big  and then she just went away.  Well, we had our Veruca Salt rugs.  Veruca Salt.  Did we ever tell the audience...  He rocked it.  Did we ever tell the audience  that we could have went home  with Veruca Salt?  Many times.  There's no doubt in our minds.  Beth Hart. 
[00:32:30]  Beth Hart.  Remember Beth Hart?  I loved her the most,  but she wasn't commercial enough.  That's right, Fish.  The entire cast of Lilith Fair.  Right.  I'm going to see Lilith Fair this year.  Are you, you fruit?  Or you dyke?  Speaking of the broads,  you can't get away from Indigo Girls.  Every time you walk into a Starbucks,  they're playing the Indigo Girls.  Is that Alanis Morissette?  Looks like Alanis to me.  Doesn't look like Alanis.  It's Alanis.  And Coulier.  And Coulier.  But it doesn't look like her. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, it does.  Okay.  Yeah.  Good one.  All right.  There you go.  I just wanted evidence.  This is Beth Hart.  Myth busted.  Good pick up, Iraq.  Hold on.  Listen to this.  They still use this.  They just used it on Californication, too.  Really?  Just new or old.  Old.  Really old.  Anytime there's something about L.A., they play this.  This is very lesbian sounding.  She used to come in with her non-existent tits,  no bra, with a white T-shirt on.  Remember?  Yeah.  She was all nips. 
[00:33:30]  You just see nipples coming through.  All nips with, I mean, completely flat.  Yeah.  She was a cool bra, though.  She came in and did our show a bunch.  I've never heard this.  She's really talented.  Beth Hart?  Yeah.  Is she playing the piano?  How about Tori Amos?  She was a weirdo.  My ex-ex years ago liked her.  That's why I kind of resented her. 
[00:34:00]  Ah.  My favorite female singer, though, Lucinda Williams.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  She has the greatest voice ever.  I still love that song that guy brought on.  Which one?  Remember the guy came on from Over the Road Trucking or whatever it was?  This channel?  Oh, that loan attack.  Can't Let Go.  I actually bought this CD.  Or downloaded it.  I Can't Let Go.  Lucinda Williams?  By Lucinda Williams.  It's fucking great.  I listen to that all the time.  She's got a killer voice, man.  What song is this?  Can't Let Go.  It's the only song by her I've ever listened to.  I have the record, but this is the only one I've ever listened to. 
[00:34:30]  Listen to this just a little bit.  She's got a great voice.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, she does.  Playing the get box.  Randy, you're tuning son of a bitch.  I told me, baby, one more time.  Don't make me sit all alone and cry.  Well, it's over. 
[00:35:00]  I know it, but I can't let go.  I'm like a fish out of water, a cat in a tree.  You don't even want to talk to me.  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  He won't take me back when I come around.  Says he's sorry, then he puts me out.  I got a big chain around my neck.  And I'm broken down like a train wreck.  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  Jesus.  It's really good.  See, I got a can when I burn so bright in my window. 
[00:35:30]  If I'm not, well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  You don't like to see me standing around.  I feel like I've been shot and fall down.  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  It won't take me back when I come around.  No?  I don't hate it.  I don't hate it, but I'm not at it.  It's tough.  It's just there for you? 
[00:36:00]  It's a little too country.  I'm starting to get into country a little bit more.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because it's where rock went.  Where did rock go?  It's kind of country music now.  Yeah.  Oh, the old school rock.  Kid Rock, I love his country stuff.  His kind of rockish, southern rock shit.  I like that a lot more than his rap stuff.  A lot more than that.  What's the big song he did?  The...  The...  The...  The...  The...  The... 
[00:36:30]  The...  Never listen to that.  No?  Love it.  No.  My name is Kid.  You rock.  Have we gone off on this song?  Did we do this like two weeks ago?  Yeah.  Last week.  I hold on.  It's better.  The Slash song we did.  No, this is better.  Not better.  How do you not like this?  Especially when it was out.  Yeah, it's okay.  But I mean...  I hold on to it a lot better.  This was better than anything when it came out. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  It was like, this is shit.  It really is.  And this is full of questions.  You don't have any answers.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  Why, Jimmy?  This is not my thing.  Yeah?  I don't think it stinks.  This is not my thing.  I'm just waiting for Methadone Clinics.  It just rocks.  Nice.  All right, we're done.  Oh, yeah.  Did you like Lucinda Williams' voice, though? 
[00:37:30]  What about the cell block?  What about the people on cell block?  Oh, you want that part, too?  The cab's a mask, half-pints of love, and the fifth's a stress.  For the hookers all drinking out in Hollywood.  And from our hoods of the world misunderstood.  I said, it's all good, and it's only fun.  They're getting in the pit and trying to love someone.  All with the water.  There you go.  Jumping in the pit.  Right?  I don't think there's a person alive that changes the radio if this song comes on.  It is true. 
[00:38:00]  Come on.  Who says, ah, I'm not feeling this one?  Yeah.  Jess just found out this weekend that I know every word to this entire album.  Because I loved it when it came out.  Right.  She was so embarrassed.  Good.  Why?  Because we put the album on, and I was singing along to every song.  And she was like, what are you doing?  Because Kid Rock's not cool anymore, but I still think he's the man.  The embarrassing factor is a little before that in your marriage, right?  That's not true.  Wrestling figures?  No, she's actually never been embarrassed of me before. 
[00:38:30]  Wrestling figures?  No, she's never been able to not hide it before.  This is the first time that the fucking bag opened, you could hear Jess's disgust.  It's everything.  It just pours out.  Were you playing with your toys while you were singing the song?  I was in the bathtub with my wrestlers.  Was the Hulkster saying this to someone?  I used to track through this whole album, too.  It's a great album.  What were the songs on this?  I haven't thought about it in a long time.  Oh, yeah.  That was released before.  Devil Without a Cause.  Devil Without a Cause, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  I don't know that one.  Featuring Joe C.  I'm the J-O-E to the C, ho.  Devil Without a Cause sounds like a sick fucking puppy song.  Can we play Devil Without a Cause?  And what was the slow one?  Only God Knows Why.  Yeah, Only God Knows Why.  Yeah, which is a great song.  That's a great song.  Oh, I didn't know that was off this record.  That's great.  Good fade.  Oh, this is fantastic.  See, because people go, oh, he always had this in him.  That's off this record?  Yes.  Oh, I know.  And this is auto-tune before auto-tune was big.  Yeah.  And a little country feel to it, too. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, this is really good.  There was a long delay between Cher using auto-tune and everyone else using auto-tune.  Yeah, but she stunk when she did it.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  Botox mouth.  That's Botox mouth.  Oh, yeah.  That's why that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, when I was in high school, it was just this album was in my car always.  Yeah, Joe C was good, man.  Call me Joe C. Got more game than Coleco. 
[00:40:00]  Now, this is better.  This is the best song on the album by far, guys.  No matter what else on the album, this is better.  Depends on what kind of mood you're in.  Any kind of mood.  Sometimes you want to rock out.  Sometimes you want to just be a devil without a cause, you know?  Oh, well.  You got to rebel sometimes.  Are you really a Kid Rock fan?  Huge.  And you never heard the song you did with Slash?  No.  You're a fucking Peter Pumper.  That was a great song, too.  I rolled on by fucking Slash and Kid Rock.  Why don't you find that instead of fucking around and they're playing fucking board games?  Sorry, you only like one song that he does. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  Can't even argue with him.  He's right.  Oh, yeah?  Well, you only like one song.  Yeah, this is awesome.  The Slash has come up with that first solo record.  It was good, right?  It's a fucking masterpiece.  Running with the devil.  No, it's a different song.  Running with the devil.  Just dance it.  Comfort in my dreams.  Unprotected silent screams.  Amazing now. 
[00:41:00]  Or light me on your shadow beams.  Nah.  Are you going to like this?  I like this.  If I want to go mellow, I'll pick up some of that Sheryl Crow Kid Rock shit.  Ah, there you go.  That's my shit picture.  Yeah.  It gets a little heavier.  You're going to live for me.  Nah, fuck this.  Yeah.  Fuck this.  I don't like this.  I'm not feeling it either.  Fuck this.  Generic sounding.  You guys are all crazy.  It is good, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks.  I trust Teft in these areas.  Oh, boy. 
[00:41:30]  I'll put it on American Badass anytime, bro.  You're going flat now?  Fucking American Badass.  Yeah.  Travis, who did you retweet yesterday?  Courtney Love.  Yeah, it was hilarious.  It was a funny tweet.  Courtney Love.  Are we going to get her?  So maybe we shouldn't talk about it.  I don't know.  Why not?  I might.  She's out of her fucking mind.  You guys are naive.  She's great.  She's trying to give Amanda Bynes, or how do you say her fucking name?  Amanda Bynes.  Amanda Bynes, some advice.  She just writes, pull it together, dude.  She writes, pull it together. 
[00:42:00]  Did you say that?  Pull it together, dude.  But she means it.  That's the sad part, because Courtney Love thinks she's got it all together finally.  When Courtney Love is telling you to pull it together, holy fuck.  Are you out there?  Right.  Like that, Mars?  Amanda Bynes did not appreciate that.  No?  No.  That's a funny tweet.  She replied back to her.  But she wasn't trying to be funny.  No, she wasn't.  That's why it might be the greatest tweet ever.  Courtney Love telling Amanda Bynes to pull it together.  Pull it together, dude.  She is coming off like a fucking crazy-ass bitch at Amanda Bynes. 
[00:42:30]  Yep.  Oh, man.  How about we attack her Twitter today and try to get her on the radio show?  Yeah, that works.  Yeah.  In a nice way.  In a nice way.  Oh, yeah.  We just said the word attack.  We have a decent fan base.  I just want people to tweet Amanda Bynes and say, hey, Opie and Anthony would love to talk to you.  No, we have a large fan base.  They are far from decent.  They're decent.  Especially when they go on a mission to tweet.  No, they're going to be decent.  Very good.  They're going to be decent today, I know.  Yeah?  Yes, they're going to be very decent.  We really want to get her on the show. 
[00:43:00]  She, uh, I think she's dealing with some serious psychological issues.  She's great.  Amanda?  Yeah.  Twitter was made for her.  Well, now she says that her tweets to Rihanna were fake.  Oh, no.  That's fake.  Yes.  Were they fake, though?  No, no.  No, of course not.  From her account, or did somebody retweet that one?  No, no, no.  Somebody hacked my account, a rate, a rate, a rate, a rate.  You think Amanda Bynes gave someone her password?  A rate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amanda Bynes. 
[00:43:30]  So what did she say back to Courtney Love?  Uh, she wrote back.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  Courtney Love is the ugliest woman I've ever seen.  To be mentioned by her, it all makes me and all my friends laugh.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, good for her.  She's, she's crazy.  Man, did she go from complete innocence, uh, and, you know-  Oh, right here.  We tweeted that Bynes needs to pull it together, so Bynes responded,  Courtney Love is the ugliest woman I've ever seen.  Oh, bees.  She doesn't hold back. 
[00:44:00]  No, she doesn't.  She's-  Look at her wacky wig.  That's CNN.  Let's talk about Justin Bieber, shall we?  Justin Bieber's neighbors near Los Angeles claim he's using the neighborhood streets as  his own test track. For the second time in two months, Beaver is being investigated for reckless  driving. There he is. Police say one of the witnesses who's complained about Beaver speeding  around their gated community in his white Ferrari is former NFL star Keyshawn Johnson.  Yeah, Johnson's really upset, apparently. All right, so the San Antonio Spurs are going to have to wait.  But that's all they got? He's kind of upset, apparently. 
[00:44:30]  He's upset. We'll keep you posted on this developing story. CNN talked about Amanda  Bynes said something. Who gives a fuck? That's their little entertainment. It's a little  morning entertainment taste for you there, Jimmy. Oh, yeah, they love that.  Courtney loves the ugliest woman I've ever seen.  She loves calling other women ugly and shit like that.  No, she didn't do that about Rihanna. That was fake.  That was fake, but... That was hysterical. It's the same M.O. as the fucking... 
[00:45:00]  What'd she say about Rihanna again? The exact tweet?  I don't know verbatim. All right, no problem. But she implied, you know, to paraphrase,  she said that Chris Brown beat up Rihanna because Rihanna was ugly.  Was ugly. And that she's met Rihanna in person. Yeah.  And knows for a fact that Rihanna is indeed ugly. It's ugly. Wow.  Many people disagree, but Amanda Bynes would say they are wrong.  That's wonderful. Amanda Bynes.  She, uh, she's going to sue everybody. 
[00:45:30]  Sue everyone? They touched  my vagina.  The police were very,  very disrespectful.  I didn't throw a  bong out the window.  What's she saying? The NYPD  slapped her vagina?  He slapped my vagina and my head  was bashed apart.  I'm suing everybody.  Imagine  they really did, but there's no way.  You should be able to prove it.  If you got a crazy bitch like that, you can do whatever you want 
[00:46:00]  and then just go, ah, she's crazy, obviously.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Oh, too good.  She wrote, uh,  you look so ugly trying to be white.  And then, uh,  Chris,  Chris,  she worked at the same.  And then minutes later,  Chris Brown beat you because you're not pretty enough.  No one wants to be your lover,  so you call everyone and their mother  that I almost named my new dog Rihanna.  Oh.  Ouch.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Rihanna responded with,  you see what happens when they cancel intervention.  Why not shave its, uh,  shave its ass and teach it to walk backwards?  That's a funny one.  She could use that.  And then,  and Amanda replied to the intervention comment.  Unlike your fugly faced self,  I don't do drugs.  You need the intervention dog.  I met your ugly face in person.  You aren't pretty.  You know it.  She's fucking great, man.  How do you not love that?  Although Gucci Mane believes Amanda Bynes is doing it right.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  So everybody's got an opinion.  Gucci Mane.  Oh, I know.  I know who he is.  Motherfucking Gucci Mane.  Gucci Mane is the, uh, uh, professional rapper.  Yep.  Who has an ice cream cone with a lightning bolt tattooed to his face.  Remember that guy?  Oh, fuck yeah.  How can you forget?  Gucci Mane.  Gucci Mane with a lightning bolt ice cream cone.  Right.  That's the craziest tattoo ever.  I don't even know if it's the worst tattoo ever,  but I know it's the craziest tattoo ever.  Oh, God. 
[00:47:30]  Is that really on his face?  Yeah, Burr.  Why?  Why would you do that?  Because he's cool, but he's hot.  No.  Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, is that what that represents?  Oh, that's fine.  Burr.  That's his catchphrase.  I like ice cream.  And you like lightning bolts?  I'm not going to put a fucking ice cream tattoo on, though.  You need lightning bolts to make it cool.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  At least this guy thinks Amanda Bynes has her shit together.  Yo, man, I want ice cream cone with free scoops. 
[00:48:00]  There's free scoops on there and a lightning bolt.  You want that on your arm?  Nah, put it on my face, motherfucker.  What a lunatic.  Why is Brad Thor tweeting us?  Does he have another book coming out?  Oh, yeah?  Remember the Brad Thor guy?  Of course.  The author, he was great on the show.  For some reason, people are reaching out to him.  Maybe he's going to make it into New York.  We'll have him on again. 
[00:48:30]  Yes.  Amanda Bynes, how is it going?  Are we closer to getting her on the show?  Well, Amanda Bynes.  Come on, Amanda Bynes.  We're the show for you.  You've got some things to say, and we're willing to listen.  She was angry at a mugshot.  Why?  Well, she couldn't wear her blonde wig.  So she had to be there with her short little bob cut.  That blonde wig is horrendous.  And she didn't like her nose job.  That blonde wig is terrible.  Did she have a nose job?  Yeah, yeah.  She got a lot of plastic surgery. 
[00:49:00]  She didn't like her eye webbing, is what she said.  She was beautiful.  She had eye webbing, she thought, which is right where the nose meets your eye kind of  thing.  There's a little ridge there on some people.  And she apparently had that and didn't like it.  So she had that removed, and she had a nose job.  Look at her.  She looks like a completely different person.  She, like, she's as innocent as, like, little Clarissa from Clarissa Explains It All 
[00:49:30]  was.  She was in here yesterday.  Clarissa?  Uh-huh.  Really?  What a coincidence.  What time?  Did you get a picture?  I got a picture a while back.  She was in here at, like, noon, probably.  Yeah.  How does she look these days?  Is she cute?  Oh, boy.  She doesn't look good, huh?  Oh, no.  She was adorable back in the day.  When was she popular?  What years?  Late 80s.  93.  93, right?  Early 90s?  Late 80s?  Yeah, early 90s.  Is it early 90s?  Yeah, maybe so, yeah.  What does she look like nowadays?  Is there a picture on her?  Look how hot a man of Bynes used to be.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  That's old her?  Not even that long ago.  No.  That's when she was starting to grow up.  Right there, look.  She was beautiful.  Yes.  Look at this.  She took miles of black cock.  Did she?  Yeah.  Well, all right.  So there's more good stuff about her.  I would date her and just make her tell me about it while I fucked her.  What the hell is wrong with you?  I'm all encompassing it.  I'm good.  I don't.  Who'd she fuck?  Who'd she fuck?  Drake?  No, she wanted Drake to, what, destroy her vagina? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, that's what she said her request was, for Drake to destroy her vagina.  Did he?  Who did she fuck?  He might have.  She should have fucked Lexus and Steele.  I don't think she just wanted a black cock.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  The biggest black cock she could find.  So now, where's, like, a picture now?  Oh, I'm sorry.  She didn't say destroy.  She said murder.  She looks very goofy now.  Yeah, she wants Drake to murder her vagina.  That's great.  Oh, boy.  Good for you.  That's great. 
[00:51:00]  Now, where's the other broad?  Oh.  Yeah, we've seen all these pictures.  That's what she looks like now.  That's the same girl.  Oh, I'd still fucking, fucking, after Drake wrecked her pussy, if she showered, I'd like it.  You'd have to.  Oh, look at her.  Wow.  Aw.  America's sweetheart to, uh, fucking nightmare.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  Is that really her doing an unsexy duck lip?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Yes.  Oh, man. 
[00:51:30]  No more webbing.  What does the webbing look like?  Can I see that?  I don't know.  I'm sure it's just, like, you know.  It really just.  No, it wasn't crow's feet.  It's right here.  Look at an old picture of her.  Between the nose and the eye.  Close-up face, old picture of her.  Oh, this thing?  Yes.  Yes.  The wrinkle between, like, the bridge of the nose and the inside of the eye.  It's just like a.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  That's what started the plastic surgery on her?  She hated that and hated her nose.  Yeah, she hated her nose.  Hated her nose.  That's her old nose?  Yeah, man.  She looks.  She looks fucking fine, yo. 
[00:52:00]  I hope Drake says, I don't fuck any girl without eye webbing.  And she shaved her whole head.  Oh, look at her.  Drake should put out cakes.  Drake's coffee cake.  Cake humor is not working today.  I tried one in the rain and it bombed her.  Cake jokes are really falling flat today.  They usually kill.  Cake jokes are usually a home run automatically.  Who's that, Justin Bieber?  No, that's Amanda Bynes.  She shaved her head.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah, that's her mugshot.  She's very unhappy with her. 
[00:52:30]  That's why she's wearing that really attractive blonde wig.  That's very real.  That's realistic, too.  Yeah.  You don't think this is a whole thing she's doing?  No, I think she's having a manic episode.  Oh, okay.  Maybe.  Yeah, this is like one of those things where people are entertained by it, but it's a very  dangerous time for her, I believe.  It's like when Britney Spears shaved her head.  Yeah, yeah.  She got through it fine, right?  Well.  She's nuts.  Years later.  Yeah, I mean, you know.  She's a little nutty.  Is she, because she insists she doesn't do drugs.  No, she's allergic to them.  Yes.  She's allergic to drugs and alcohol. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  All drugs.  Does that mean she's in recovery?  That might mean she's in recovery.  Oh, really?  Sometimes people say I'm allergic.  Code word?  Yeah, it means I can't take it.  Allergic.  Wow.  But you know what?  She might, like, Britney had the same thing.  When a girl, a woman is a fucking complete sex symbol.  Whoops.  And they get to a certain age.  Yeah.  It might start to freak them out when they hit their mid-  Like, how old was Britney when that happened?  And then how old is she when she's melting down?  It might be a fucking thing.  Britney Spears was far more popular than Amanda Bynes.  Yeah, that's true.  But I'm saying, as a woman who was liked when they were younger, when you start to get a 
[00:53:30]  little older, you feel like you're not as hot.  Yeah, that's true.  They go through a fucking, a major fucking mental nosedive for a while.  Now she looks better.  Yeah, Amanda Bynes would be approaching 30, so.  And how old was Britney Spears when that happened?  Probably about that.  About 27, 20?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you start being like a young kid.  When you start-  When you start being the one.  Yeah.  Like, or the one that everybody is looking at or beautiful.  All of a sudden you're irrelevant or you think you're irrelevant and you look back and  you see all these hotter, younger people.  Yeah, she's 27 now.  Yeah, maybe that's a big part of it. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, you start to notice like the little signs of aging.  Yeah.  Freak you out.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like on the advice show today, I'll be covering that aging and the signs thereof.  Jim Norton's advice show at 10.  I will not be doing it alone, though.  Who's coming in?  I have a very special young lady friend.  Oh.  Bring it by, Rupert.  I'd love to meet her him.  Which one?  Oh, it's Bailey J.  Oh, Bailey's coming in today?  Bailey.  Very cool.  Also, Opie and Anthony, the podcast, episode three, is now available for your downloading

Big appetites for your sausage.  600 pounds a man. 
[00:55:30]  Sausage.  He was enraging.  Oh, he was.  No, he's the greatest.  He really was enraging, though.  Because he's trying to stay calm.  Yeah.  Because the sausage got smaller.  Yeah, he was just stating a well-thought-out case.  Yes.  Sausages.  Oh, he's the best.  He's not enraging.  Oh, dude.  He's not enraging.  It's a smaller package.  Package.  Package.  Fuck.  Package of sausage.  And the big fat sow in the back has to pipe in.  Yeah.  What did she say again? 
[00:56:00]  I don't know.  One line.  Don't play it here because, yeah, you got to download the podcast, please.  Episode three available.  And I think I'm already thinking that the Otto and George bit you tweeted yesterday.  The NTM bit.  Oh, my God.  I re-listened to that.  We might have to throw that out on the podcast next week.  That made me laugh for a week when you said that.  Yes.  Be a dear.  NTM from what?  The Wizard of Oz?  The Good Witch?  No, no.  It was NTM was the aunt.  Oh, the aunt. 
[00:56:30]  Who committed suicide.  I thought it was the Good Witch, too, but it wasn't.  It was NTM.  It turned out to be NTM.  Good Witch is Glenda.  Glenda.  Oh.  Would you see Wicked?  Duh.  No, I know Glenda the Good Witch.  I saw Wizard of Oz.  I thought you saw Wicked.  No, I saw the movie.  The Wicked Witch and Glenda are friends, and they hold this whole scheme to hook up the  Wicked Witch with the Wizard.  Broadway Anthony Cumia.  Just to make it look like they were.  The Wizard of Oz was all fake. 
[00:57:00]  Ah.  See?  They actually, the Wizard and the Wicked Witch, they hook up and fucking take off together.  Nice.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  How much money did you save us?  $600 a piece?  Yeah, exactly.  Every Broadway show.  It's our cats.  Every fucking, every type of Broadway show like that that I've been dragged to was just  to get laid.  Sure.  Just to get laid.  Yeah.  I want some young twink from out of town.  I want some boy-ass fucking man.  So the older gentleman who's taking around? 
[00:57:30]  Yes, the understudy.  So Jersey Boys was?  No, Jersey Boys was very good.  Trying to get laid.  That was different.  I went with my sister, you.  They're saying Broadway.  I've already fucked her.  They're saying Broadway in trouble.  Yeah.  Ticket sales down.  I can't imagine that.  Oh, shit.  With all the fat housewives they continue to make.  Oh, shit.  Isn't, what, that ABBA show there?  Mamma Mia.  Isn't that leaving?  Yeah.  That's leaving.  That's leaving.  Is that a big show?  Yeah.  That was there since Cats left. 
[00:58:00]  That was Mamma Mia?  I didn't know that.  Mamma Mia.  Yeah.  What's going in that theater?  I think there's something going in.  Is that the Rocky?  Yes.  Rocky the fucking musical.  Making a musical out of Rocky.  American Psycho, too.  Oh, boy.  All these niche musicals.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to fight.  Fight, fight, fight.  Fight, fight, fight.  Yeah.  Oh, it's going to be so embarrassing. 
[00:58:30]  Don't do it, Rocky.  You'll go blind.  I'm losing my baby in the pet store.  How are they going to fight a manly Rocky for Broadway, by the way?  You know, they're always a little off when they play the man parts on Broadway.  It's going to be like Hugh Jackman or something.  Yeah, yeah.  But they're always just slightly off, even though they're supposed to be playing the man-man. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  The big closing song is, butt your shit on the rug again.  And, like, two fucking, like, real fruity guys will sing, like, cuff and link.  Cuff and link.  There is turtles.  There is turtles.  It's cuff and.  Yeah, they just take all these non-moments.  Yes.  And make a big fucking production number.  It'll be a big, the poem he read, Adrian and Rocky, too.  Oh, God.  Because I'd always be there to catch ya.  To catch ya. 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  After we get married, see the tigers at the zoo.  What are you doing for the next 30 years?  Yo, Adrian.  Yo, Adrian.  Yo, Adrian.  And she'll have her own little special, like, fucking spotlight on her moment.  Yes.  Just beat that jiggable Rocky. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  So Rocky's going to be there.  I don't think it's going to last as long as Cats and Mamma Mia did.  You don't think it's going to have a good run?  I don't know.  Who the fuck knows at Broadway?  When did Cats leave?  I don't know.  It was supposed to be now and forever.  And forever.  Yeah, what happened to the forever part?  That sucked.  That was a good musical.  How do you know all these Broadway songs, man? 
[01:00:30]  That's one of those themes, right?  That's the theme.  Mamma Mia started in 2001.  Really?  Yeah.  Cats was there until 2001?  Fuck yeah.  You just gave me a hilarious idea for a fucking Vine video. 
[01:01:00]  Wait till you see it.  It's going to fucking be funny.  Wait.  What is it?  I ain't telling you.  I don't want to.  Stealing it.  All right.  Yeah, you'll fucking steal it, piece of garbage.  All right, we're going to take a break here.  What do you got for the break, you rock?  You got anything fun?  Anything?  Anything?  No.  No?  Good for you. 
[01:01:30]  Maybe another Lucinda Williams song?  My aunt doesn't like it, though.  Uh-uh.  What other songs does she have?  I could always take my headphones off.  I don't know.  She's got one about a gravel fucking driveway, I think, or a gravel road.  That's the name of the record, actually.  Is it?  Really?  Yeah, what's that one called again?  The album's called Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good album.  Up on the gravelly road.  Oh, there's a song.  I have to wait.  Yeah?  Okay. 
[01:02:00]  But aunt doesn't like this, so we shouldn't do this.  I'll just take my headphones off.  Oh, okay.  Just a little taste.  There we go.  More Lucinda Williams.  Sitting in the kitchen.  The house of bacon.  Loretta singing on the radio.  Smell of coffee.  Eggs and bacon.  Car wheels.  On a gravel road. 
[01:02:30]  Pull the curtains back and look outside.  Somebody somewhere don't know.  Come on, now, child.  We're gonna go for a ride.  Car wheels.  On a gravel road.  Car wheels.  On a gravel road.  Car wheels.  On a gravel road.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:03:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Bow down before the one you serve. 
[01:03:30]  You're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  Nine Inch Nails on the only station that really rocks.  Uh-oh.  That's a flashback.  Nine Inch Nails.  New album. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And tour in the fall.  I like Nin.  Nin.  Here's Nin.  Dude, you got any pot, USA?  What was the one that was, uh, we played, uh, what was it called?  Pig or Piggy?  Piggy.  Piggy, right?  That was an AAF song.  Yeah.  When we first got there.  You got Piggy?  Oh.  It's too easy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:04:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I like this dumb song.  I dated a girl who wanted me to have sex with Trent Reznor.  She thought it was really sexy.  She told me, like, years after.  She was fantasized about me and Trent Reznor.  Really?  Yes.  That's so odd.  Our little intern was so cute.  She's like a little pixie walking around.  Nah, I'm like that.  Be silly.  Bang, bang, bang. 
[01:05:00]  Just going to listen to this? 
[01:05:30]  I don't know.  I didn't know where to jump in.  Sometimes you don't know where to jump in.  And then I was just kind of enjoying it.  All right, enough.  Yeah, Ninn's doing a tour and a new album in the fall.  That's kind of cool, right?  I never saw Nine Inch Nails live.  No.  I'd like to see them.  Yeah, are they like a live act?  I don't know.  Is it known as like a live act?  That's a very good question.  I have no idea how they sound live. 
[01:06:00]  They sound good.  I heard that, you know, they had like a whole fucking live sounds really good.  Yeah.  But I don't know if they're like one of those that you really got to kind of sit there and  look at, or is it more of a fucking techno feel to it?  I have no idea.  My wife goes to all the concerts.  What?  She loves Nine Inch Nails.  Does she?  Really?  Yeah.  She said it's one of the best bands she's ever seen.  Really?  Yeah.  We shouldn't.  Travis has something to say about this.  They're great live.  You got to go see them.  Really? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  They're really fucking good.  What makes them great live?  They just sound amazing and he's a great front man.  Oscar award winner?  Yeah.  Trent Reznor.  That is right.  What did he win for?  Social Network.  Social Network soundtrack.  He did that.  He scored the whole thing?  He did that damn thing.  What was the big song on that?  I don't remember.  He scored it.  It's like one of those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He pushed out the Oingo Boingo guy.  He's in that world now.  In that world.  Yes.  He did Lost Highway too.  Did he really?  Yeah.  The Lynch movie.  Oh man. 
[01:07:00]  The Oingo Boingo guys gotta be pissed.  Oingo Boingo guys mad.  Trent Reznor's taking his gig slowly but surely.  Yeah.  What do they watch the movie and just think of like, that's gotta be a tough job.  And they go, playing, playing, playing over here.  They actually do.  And there's a screen up in a room where they have like a fucking orchestra and shit.  And they're playing the parts of the movie and they're woo-doo.  And then this little sensitive part.  Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  And then, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yeah, yeah.  I can do that.  It's good and bad. 
[01:07:30]  It dates a movie too.  Oh man.  There's some...  That Casio shit.  The 80s just are gone.  Oh God.  Because of their fucking little wacky sounds that they thought were gonna be forever.  Right.  No.  Like what?  Damn.  What was an 80s sound in a movie?  Oh God.  Let's see.  I guess the music and...  A lot of the comedies and...  War games, I think.  War games?  Yeah.  Kind of synthy, fucking 80s sound.  Most of them.  Most of them, really.  I can't think of a sound.  I don't have one in particular. 
[01:08:00]  Weird science.  Weird.  Weird news.  That's the Oingo Boingo guy.  Yes.  The Oingo Boingo guy.  What's his real name?  Someone said he gets pissed when you call him the Oingo Boingo guy.  Does he?  Yes.  Fuck him.  Is he the Simpsons guy?  What do you mean?  No, it's Eric.  No, who's the guy?  Danny Elfman.  The Simpsons guy does tons of movies.  Yeah, he does a lot of shit.  Okay.  Danny Elfman.  Save it for the podcast.  Oh, shit.  Which podcast did that go?  The Simpsons?  The Simpsons podcast? 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  Ah, you rock him.  So yeah, you should definitely go see them when they come back around.  I would love to.  You have to.  They're very good.  He's very good.  Obama, proven once again that he's a nerd.  Oh.  I heard you start that.  We said it a long time ago, man.  He's a nerd.  He is a nerd.  And he sucks at sports.  Yeah.  But the media loves showing him play basketball like he really knows what he's doing on a basketball  court.  He doesn't.  Doesn't know what he's doing on a golf course. 
[01:09:00]  And he was throwing footballs yesterday like a nerd.  Oh, was he?  With Governor Christie.  Oh, him and Christie, fucking asshole buddies.  Yeah.  They're asshole buddies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was part two of their, you know, little thing they did.  Yeah.  Six months ago.  Six months ago.  They had to continue that thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Helping Jersey.  But I guess they were playing some of those board, you know, boardwalk games and.  Oh, really?  And Obama, I think, was 0 for 5.  And Governor Christie just fucking.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, it's a little hot.  Here we go.  Let me see something. 
[01:09:30]  How about some full screen?  There we go.  All right.  Look how he throws.  Is he throwing lefty?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a lefty.  Oh, okay.  Look.  He really is a lefty.  Throw a second.  Oh!  He's losing some weight.  And his pants are coming down just a little bit more.  Good.  Right? 
[01:10:00]  A little bit.  Look, look.  He's losing weight though.  He is losing weight.  No shit.  He still looks like a pair though.  Well, he's going to need that skin.  A pair with pants too high.  That's skin surgery.  You think?  Yeah.  They showed pictures of him younger.  Naked.  He was never.  He wasn't a fat guy growing up.  That's why he might need it though.  You think?  Yeah.  If you put on that much in adulthood, a lot of times you just gotta.  He's definitely losing weight, but he still has that pair shape.  You know, it's fucked up.  You gotta look at this guy as.  All right.  He wants to be president.  Let's not fuck around.  Wow. 
[01:10:30]  That's how he used to look.  Jesus.  I mean, granted, that's probably high school, but.  Yeah.  You gotta wonder about a guy that wants to be president that had something going on mentally  where he felt he needed to eat so much that he got obese.  You think that's what it is?  There's something there, some kind of emotional, psychological thing that should be addressed.  I don't know.  I think.  I think, I think some people they're just destined to be, you know, bigger.  Dude, that you don't, you don't get that big by just maybe, you know, indulging a few 
[01:11:00]  times.  Sure.  But I, I think you're born with a body type and then it's up to you within that range.  Don't forget.  I just don't see that he could be as, as thin as us.  Well, even if he ate a salad for the rest of his life, but he, he was dangerously, grossly  obese.  But you know what it is with fat people?  You can just see their addiction.  Like Obama smokes.  Like a lot of people have these compulsive things.  We just don't see.  That's the one you notice.  Like, you don't know how many of these guys might drink behind the scenes or fucking 
[01:11:30]  be unhealthy, but whenever it's food, it's just really obvious.  Cause you know, they become big people.  Is Obama allowed to smoke in the white house?  I bet he does.  Wow.  Really?  That's against a lot of rules.  The weed.  The wacky tobacco.  You think he has just a little, little piece of land outside the white house he's allowed  to smoke in?  Not inside.  He's got to go out.  Like the rest of the people.  By one of the columns up on the front door.  Right.  Fucking cold.  Yeah.  Then gets back into the west wing. 
[01:12:00]  They were talking about governor Christie's weight again last night.  Like what's the big deal?  It's no one's business.  And someone made a great point.  You know, there's a good possibility.  The guy could drop dead of a heart attack in office.  Yeah.  If he's that big.  And Cheney's that big.  And then you throw the stress, uh, that comes with the job.  Yeah.  Of course it should be an issue.  I like governor Christie too.  I do too.  I don't want him to win until I get a photo of him.  He's a little too palsy with, uh, Obama.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  But he's, uh, from your side.  Mm.  Not really.  There's some gun legislation going on in Jersey right now that if he doesn't veto, he's  gonna lose a lot of people on the, on the right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the legislation?  Uh, gun control issues that will do absolutely nothing for the safety of people, which is all  of this gun legislation, by the way.  Right.  I think they're looking to make gun, uh, laws even stricter in Chicago.  And, uh, the ones they have there now are the strictest in the country and people are, 
[01:13:00]  what was it?  Six people killed, 17 shot over, uh, last weekend.  Wow.  Just crazy.  But again, no one addresses it because it's just black people shooting each other and the  media doesn't really, it's not a sexy enough story.  Right.  It's too commonplace.  Well, of course they're not going to report on that when you got a baby in a, in a, in  a pipe.  Pipe baby.  They keep showing that video.  That's so creepy.  Pipe of horrors.  I would say.  Pipe of horrors.  Toilet of horrors.  Toilet of horrors. 
[01:13:30]  Everything's gotta just be of horrors now.  Now, uh, who, did the mom step forward, I think?  Overnight, finally?  Uh.  Saying she made a terrible mistake, whatever the fuck that means.  It was an era.  Oh, fuck her.  She's trying to get rid of her fucking baby.  It's obvious.  It's an attempted murder thing they're looking at.  She's trying to kill a live infant.  So.  That's just an amazing story.  Amazing.  You know, another one the media ignored totally, totally ignored was that fucking, that doctor  in Philly, that abortion doctor who was ripping the spines out of live babies, that black 
[01:14:00]  abortion doctor.  Yes.  And I'm pro-choice, but this guy was a piece of garbage.  And, uh, boy, the media fucking-  Why was he ripping the spines out?  Fox News was covering it.  Yeah, the only ones.  The only one, though.  MSNBC wasn't fucking touching it because it's a touchy issue with the left, the abortion  issue.  And, um-  And he's black.  And he's a black guy.  And there were black babies that he was really killing.  Right.  Wait, what was he doing?  Oh, my God, what he was doing.  Late term abortions.  Oh, ripping the spines out.  Why did he have to do that?  They were alive.  Some of these babies, the late term abortion, they were alive when they came out. 
[01:14:30]  This one woman testified that there was a baby swimming in the toilet.  It was in the toilet trying to get out.  And he just snapped the necks with his fingers and ripped their heads off like fucking shrimp.  Like you're fucking pulling the heads off a shrimp.  Yeah.  Oh, it's terrible.  In Philadelphia.  That just made me nauseous.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  This guy should be shot in the fucking head.  Oh, absolutely.  I'm becoming a wimp.  No, you're not.  That's fucking-  That just made me really sad inside.  It's terrible. 
[01:15:00]  It's depressing.  No one's that edgy that we want to see babies drowning.  Oh, my God.  That's a rough one.  Okay, good.  That's a rough one.  There's this weird fucking-  Oh, God, it's horrible.  There's this weird ruling that a baby isn't a baby and it isn't a life until it comes out  of the vagina.  But there are certain issues where if you kill a pregnant woman, you are also liable for  the death of the infant, which is odd because-  And then there's a time limit.  But some of these late-term abortions, they literally take instruments, put them inside 
[01:15:30]  the woman, and kill the baby inside so it's not murder.  But it just seems like semantics to me at some point.  And I'm a pro-choice guy.  Me too, yeah.  To a point, though.  Right.  You have to-  And I don't know.  There's that spiritual aspect of when the cell first divides at conception.  Is it a person?  When it's delivered?  After the third trimester starts? 
[01:16:00]  But I guess you could put a limitation on what?  After first trimester?  I think so, yeah.  You gotta put some kind of limit on wear.  First trimester is far along, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  When you see that sonogram, you realize, holy fuck, this tiny little thing has a heartbeat  already and it's fucking beating away.  Yeah.  And we'll go to the abortion clinic.  Fuck.  My brother got one for his girl once.  But the ones who are against abortion, they gotta fucking lighten up about a morning 
[01:16:30]  after pill, these religious assholes.  Again, yeah, it's all or nothing with both fucking sides, which is, like, amazing to  me.  You just explained America.  I know.  There's never any real compromise.  Never.  I mean, really, to think of a country with no abortion?  Holy fuck.  Thank God that there are abortions available to some of these fuckos that would be having  children.  What are you gonna do with them all?  They can't fucking give away some of these kids now. 
[01:17:00]  You want some of these fucking assholes that would normally get an abortion having kids?  Yuck.  But again, yeah, MSNBC, they didn't touch it.  They didn't touch that fucking story.  They didn't touch that story.  Like, no one knows his name.  How did, we should all know the guy's name.  It should have been headline news.  It's a fucking huge story.  Nothing.  Yeah.  He's in Dutch.  Oh, he's in big trouble.  He's in Dutch.  He picked three counts.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  And one on a woman.  He killed a woman?  Yeah.  Killed a woman, huh?  Yeah.  Or she died on the table or something.  Yeah.  Another case, of course, in the news, the Zimmerman case.  Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin, I guess yesterday had a decision.  The judge said that they could not use any of the text messages from Trayvon's phone about  his drug use or his penchant for violence, his suspensions in school for violence, his 
[01:18:00]  trying to procure and or sell illegal pistol.  They can't use it in the opening statements.  People saying like, oh, they can't use it.  The judge ruled they can't use it in the opening statements, but they're still going to determine  whether they can use it during the trial at some point, which I think it's relevant.  It's not putting the victim on trial.  If you're trying to show that this guy attacked George Zimmerman and that's George Zimmerman's 
[01:18:30]  case for self-defense, that he was attacked by Trayvon Martin as he was going back to his  truck and he was attacked and then shot Trayvon when he thought his life was being taken from  him.  You have to establish that perhaps this guy, Trayvon, had violence in his history.  You know, it just seems to me that it is pertinent to the case.  Maybe not the drug use, you know.  Yeah.  You know, then you may be trying to use it for something else. 
[01:19:00]  But I think all the fighting that he did, all the texts about fighting and fucking, you  know, shit like that is part of it sets up the guy's motive.  I don't know about text messages like that's almost like if you were on trial for rape.  And if somebody said, well, look at all those text messages.  Oh, man, look at this one.  We said, oh, man, I'd like to fuck her.  Like I totally out of context.  Explain it in context.  But you shouldn't. 
[01:19:30]  I think actions are what you got to be tried.  Maybe if he had violent behavior.  That's one thing.  But I don't know about text.  He did there.  There are documented fights that he had.  He was in trouble in school for fighting.  And I do think that's pertinent.  I'm not a lawyer.  Believe it or not, people.  But, yeah, so we'll see if the trial goes on.  I still think it's a slam dunk for George Zimmerman.  Yeah.  Didn't they say no to an extension?  Yeah, they said no to an extension.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:20:00]  I think it's a slam dunk self-defense case, though.  I mean, the physical evidence shows that he was definitely getting his ass beaten.  There was no other wounds on Trayvon aside from the fatal one.  So it wasn't like they were exchanging blows and, you know, who was getting the better of who is pretty obvious here.  So you think it's a slam dunk for Zimmerman?  I do.  I think Zimmerman is going to walk on this one. 
[01:20:30]  There's no way they get him for murder, too.  You think they'll offer him a plea deal?  But I think you're right.  If they offer him a plea deal, he'd be silly to take it.  I think he's going to get off on this.  I think it's a very easy.  I don't even think he'd get a manslaughter.  Honestly, I think this is completely justifiable homicide.  It's a jury, though.  I know.  That's just it.  But, you know.  You're missing the obvious, though.  What's that?  The judge is really weird looking.  Is he?  It might be a he. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, really?  You didn't see the judge yet?  Mm-mm.  No.  No, that's not the one.  Oh, that's not weird looking.  Yeah, the one right there.  Over, one, up one.  That's the judge in the case.  Oh, my God.  That's Amanda Bynes.  That's all I've been focused on.  That hairdo.  That's a hair don't.  Oh, you ain't fucking bullshitting, cocksucker.  Horrible straight, like, hair to the sides.  Looks like Paul Williams.  Yeah, it looks like a guy in a wig. 
[01:21:30]  I can't get past that.  I'm trying to figure out who she looks like.  Well, if she cut the longer part of the hair off, it would definitely be Captain Kangaroo.  Captain Kangaroo.  I feel like kind of Captain Kangaroo hair.  You didn't notice this judge yet?  No.  She's been all over the place the last few days.  Hmm.  With all the latest stuff coming out.  Yeah.  Kermit Gosnell.  Is that doctor's name?  Oh, oh, oh, there you go.  Kermit.  Yeah.  It's kind of an odd name.  Yeah.  So that trial kick off in a couple of weeks. 
[01:22:00]  Let's see what happens there.  Is it going to be a quick trial?  I don't know.  They're really going to want to.  They got to be careful with this one.  Need their cases on this one.  Yeah.  And I absolutely think there's going to be some fucking problems.  Uh, if there's an acquittal, I absolutely think there's going to be some problems.  Well, I, according to, and I, and I agree with Kenny on this, he was saying if he beats  criminal, he'll be convicted civilly, which will be a lesser burden of proof.  And I think he's right.  Yeah.  I think he'll get any problems for him.  But you know, what does that mean? 
[01:22:30]  You fucking just, you're broke at that point.  What are they going to get them on?  Yeah.  You think that, oh, civil rights, you think?  No, no, no.  Civil.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were going to maybe try them in a civil rights, they might try to, but.  but oh he took his civil rights yeah and then there uh that other case that was going down  where was this uh louisiana that case where the um i think it was baton rouge the white family 
[01:23:00]  the husband the wife and the 14 year old daughter were getting some gas oh yeah and three black uh  where's that all over the fucking up to him said you're in the wrong neighborhood you're not getting  out of here and uh the guy started beating the shit out of the husband he was just pumping gas  and then the wife got out and tried to help the husband she gets knocked out and then the 14 year  old daughter comes out to help and they the two other people that were with this guy beat the shit  out of the the 14 year old they they gave the two other people not the initial black guy a summons 
[01:23:30]  they let them go they gave them a summons to appear like a ticket for assaulting a fucking wife and a  14 year old girl uh they gave them a summons they arrested the guy he it turns out was also a sex  offender he never registered um so he's in jail and just now because i guess there's been a bit of an  outcry on this the fbi has been uh notified uh of this and and they're looking into um hate crime 
[01:24:00]  uh but if you look at holders some of holders speeches um he has said he doesn't believe white  people can can have a hate crime perpetrated against them did he say yes it's amazing what a  cocksucker it's amazing he actually said that yes wow it's terrible so you know they're looking into  that but uh they let the two people go with a summons but where's the fuck my problem is 
[01:24:30]  it's not even it's like this happens every people are just shit where's the press this always just  makes me hate the press you won't hear about that but if it was the other way around and it was three  uh black family members getting gas in a predominantly white neighborhood some white  thugs come over yeah and uh beat them senseless it first of all it would still be on the news  look at fat nick you'd be right fat nick and and those were car thieves in his neighborhood yeah and  they were adults all adults adults none of them were killed he he uh he he fucking hit him with a bat 
[01:25:00]  but uh and he's still in jail he's still in jail and meanwhile and this uh the guys are giving it's  fucking it it it it's amazing that the double standard when it comes to um black on white  crime as opposed to white on with the way the press covers it yeah like most of these guys go to jail  i mean they get fucked they go to these guys got a summons but most times the criminal justice system 
[01:25:30]  is i don't think so i think not as many as you would think i think a lot of these things skate i think a  lot of it is pled down i think uh when when you see some of these thugs finally kill people they have  a huge rap sheet that was you know they were let go this he's out on parole and he's fucking  doing this that it's just they're really not enforcing the laws that are out there uh enough  i think i think you don't hear about it you don't hear about it on the fucking no not so holder admits  no equity under hate crime bill what's that mean that means there's no equal balance uh between white 
[01:26:00]  and black policy he said uh that is what this statute tends what is is designed to cover well i think  that's part of the problem the elderly are not protected groups security guards are not protected  groups soldiers apparently not protected groups some are protected groups and get special protection  under this law but one has to look at the history of the unfortunate history in of our nation  um there are groups who have been singled out who have been the objects of violence simply because 
[01:26:30]  of their sexual orientation the color of their skin their ethnicity um we have to face and confront  that reality that which historically has been a problem for that nation continues to be a problem  for this nation oh yeah i asked you during last week's hearing whether you viewed the june 1st murder  of army private william and long that was targeted by a muslim because he was a u.s soldier as a hate  crime well there's a certain element of hate i suppose in um in that but i suppose what we're looking 
[01:27:00]  for here in terms of the expansion he is such a fucking racist he's a our our fucking attorney general  is a fucking racist yeah he is a he's a cunt eric holder is a cunt yes we heard he was going to finish  saying that because we actually said i suppose i want to hear how he finished that about the the  just a little bit cheap uh are instances where there is a historic basis to see groups of people 
[01:27:30]  who are singled out um for violence perpetrated against them because of who they are so what we're  willing to do is elevate those crimes over the very intended hate crime that this man  perpetrated on the soldier and we're saying they have an elevated status no it's not a question of  elevating the crime it is dealing with the reality that we confront 80 000 crimes directed against  people who this bill um would cover but with regard to the soldier yeah he's just yeah and these guys 
[01:28:00]  are harping on what these guys want to say right is race or they want to say religion but they have a  specific case there uh-huh because they're afraid to go to him so you're saying that muslims can attack  christians and it's okay or blacks can attack whites and it's okay right because they but they can't say it  like that so they're harping on this soldier because the group whites as a group haven't been  persecuted so you can't take an individual case-by-case basis and call it a hate crime because 
[01:28:30]  the group itself hasn't been uh persecuted over the years but blacks now they have been shit on for so  long that regardless of individual case-by-case basis or group you you have to deem it a hate crime  but white people you know because the group itself hasn't been shit on that you can't then take each  case individually which yeah that's that's what he's saying that's exactly what there's an inequity  there eric holder is a fucking racist yeah he's a bit of a twat yeah a bit of a twat he's gonna go 
[01:29:00]  too i think i bet you he's the sacrificial lamb and this fox this fox news fucking uh reporter rosen  uh getting uh his emails uh tapped by uh the department of justice it would a holder personally signed  off on yes he did there's no way he can go well it was the guys upstairs it was this guy we didn't  we're not sure who he fucking was the the point man on this thing yeah and now the media oh boy 
[01:29:30]  you know they'll fucking shit all over every other right but when that first amendment one comes  and it's one of their guys yeah now they start talking like hey what the fuck is this they're  you know freedom of the press freedom of the press uh you can't be tapping his phones and getting  his messages and fucking his emails so now they're speaking up and and holder's directly connected to  this he's in trouble huh yeah he's he's he's on the ropes a bit but again these guys are 
[01:30:00]  unfucking touchable but now they're pushing now they subpoenaed uh information on the whistleblower  or on the on the one whoever did the talking points for uh the benghazi to remove the terrorist  stuff and they they didn't let that go they subpoenaed the more more more staff records like  they really want to know who edited those fucking talk and fucking hillary it's like oh boy it's like  i want to i i really don't want to indict obama i don't it's like but fucking a bitch we want to  know so tell us who fucking edited those points yeah it matters to us you got that case and then 
[01:30:30]  the other scandal since we're talking about is the uh internal revenue uh service going after uh  conservative groups and when they're looking for tax-exempt status it seems that uh a lot of  the conservative groups that applied for it were run through the mill a lot of red tape a lot of  delays rejections meanwhile every muslim group that applied for uh tax-exempt status was put on the  fast track and granted tax-exempt status it it's obvious it's right there and then the guy that 
[01:31:00]  uh the head of the the the department that that retired he fucking resigned right he had nothing to  do with it the woman that did have something to do with it was then put on to the irs slash obamacare  uh department and she's heading that up who's the woman who won't testify and then yeah you got that  fucking um what ms fucking what's her name oh god i can't remember her name but yeah she pleads the 
[01:31:30]  fifth after giving a statement that she didn't do anything illegal she didn't do anything wrong  and then she uh says she's not giving any information wouldn't you want to get to the  bottom of it if you didn't do anything wrong and you didn't do anything illegal wouldn't you want  to know what the fuck the problem is no it's an amazing smoke screen that goes on with uh  with all of these scandals that are popping up and they won't even call them scandals by the way  it's another you know vast right-wing conspiracy apparently yeah it's no it's no birth certificate 
[01:32:00]  issue this shit's real yeah this shit's fucking real this is how it plays out all right here you go  we should uh uh tell the people that bill burr's coming in today yes billy burr coming through  town bill's at uh i don't know if tickets are available or not if there are i imagine it's very  few tonight you can see bill in red bank at the uh count basie theater and bill's got a shitload of

[01:37:30]  right he butt dials a black customer i guess we do have to set it up yeah he just dropped off a pizza  at this customer's house who's black right and the guy said in the youtube video that uh he gave him a  21 percent tip or something like that but i guess it wasn't enough so uh the delivery guy is  complaining about this customer to one of his co-workers in the car but he doesn't realize he has  butt dialed the customer that he's talking about oh my god and this was all left on the guy's voicemail 
[01:38:00]  wait and the 21 percent tip is not good on your pizza not good enough what you'd have to ask that guy  wow oh man i might be under tipping well i think a 20 percent tip is good in a restaurant they're not  filling up my water glass they're dropping a pizza off so i give them a few bucks and and send them  on their way i don't know if i'd motherfuck somebody for a 21 percent tip because people are taught that  you do 15 when you're in a restaurant before tax right it's technically the right tip so if you're 
[01:38:30]  tipping 20 on something i mean you probably don't tip society deems a job tip worthy  this guy thought it might be race related uh-huh yeah of course everything is well  oh  oh  you went old school 
[01:39:00]  sounds like you in the shower  opera all the way home  all right that was somebody's machine wow  what a dummy  do you know what's funny about this there's zero plausible explanation for it 
[01:39:30]  that's from the swat theme 
[01:40:00]  i gotta step up my game i don't even do this jesus yeah you gotta work the word into old theme  songs he's doing the tv theme songs but wait how did he if if the guy dialed his home he's on his  cell so he calls him and says hey buddy i'm right outside your apartment yeah and so the last call he  made was to the guy but then who he's talking to this guy i i at voicemail and so he's in the car  what was his buddy in the car with him i guess oh i thought he called his buddy right no no no 
[01:40:30]  oh that's why you can hear okay yeah oh that's why you can hear okay yeah oh man  i'm glad we get two versions of that  what are the big orders that are far away and it's pretty black yeah yeah  oh so black fireflies fall around in the daytime oh boy 
[01:41:00]  oh my god wow and with that we say hi to bill burr  hey what's up hey i missed i missed what you guys were listening to i know it was a voicemail that was left  inadvertently on a um a gentleman's uh uh phone from a guy that i guess uh was uh angry  with the gentleman for um not tipping was that what it was white pizza guy delivers to a black  customer he gave him and i guess got a 21 tip but that probably wasn't enough in his mind so he gets  in the car with his with his friend and he's saying all this racist stuff and he didn't realize he 
[01:41:30]  pocket dialed the customer so it's all in the customer's voicemail oh no and he was saying  he was saying some awful things he was singing nigaro yeah it was really there's no room for  interpretation no no wow that's nothing you could say well you got to take it in context so what  happens that's a good question what does happen yeah because usually when you mess up like that  you get fired and you end up delivering pizzas yeah this guy basically how much farther down can this 
[01:42:00]  guy go true i don't know i don't know what happens well he definitely got fired yeah do we know  that for sure yeah yeah you gotta fire the guy yeah that's kind of rough can't be like uh uh the  express the feelings of our drivers is not that here he does have a car that works and we're  exploiting him and would like to continue to do so outside of his feelings about race right and papa  john himself issued an apology oh he did the papa john damn he barely what did he say what did he say 
[01:42:30]  yeah i want to hear that apology he apologized to the driver for sending him to such a cheap  customer a racist organization he wrote i'll go ahead no he wrote uh friends i'm extremely concerned  to learn about the reprehensible language used by two former employees in one of our restaurants  they got rid of both yeah wow their thinking and actions defy both my personal and the company values  and everything for which this company stands the employees responsible for this absolutely 
[01:43:00]  unacceptable behavior does that ever come up in their meetings about pizza  all right now that we know what toppings we're going to push what do you guys think about puerto  ricans so yeah jesus christ we're immediately terminated my heartfelt apology goes out to the  customer involved his family and our community at large i'm very sorry that anyone would be exposed  these hurtful and painful words by any person involved in any way with our company thank you 
[01:43:30]  for your important comments i have personally reached out to our customer to share my own thoughts  and offer my deepest apology sincerely you think that guy gets free pizza for life at least i would  hope so yeah papa john do the right thing you think free pizza for life for the customer just plus  everybody loves him on world star hip-hop it's a dumb joke what everybody loves him on world star now i'm  sure the guy yeah that's where he posted it oh they love the actual the customer the customer  now would now what is the we have video of the customer no is the customer talking in the youtube

[01:52:30]  to the gym and i you know personal trainers you know one two three four wow  he's uh working out with hot personal trainers i got two yeah they're both really sexy dude you  look like fucking 10 years younger thanks i feel like i look older but thank you max said the same  thing no you look younger thank you i just want to look like a boy he's an animal in the gym bill  you'd be proud no because you can do a lot of pull-ups the only way when how many how many  pull-ups can you do i usually i'll if if my arm is not hurting i'll do a hundred but not in a row 
[01:53:00]  obviously 100 yeah but that's over 100 days yes one a day one a day and i cheat on a little apple  cream how many a set 100 how many a set uh i'll usually start with sets of 12 sometimes 15 and i'll  go down towards the end that's impressive no i do sets of 10 and they kill me i have a bet  this comic paul verzi when i'm 70 it's the stupidest bet ever you bet me 300 bucks i won't  be able to do 10 pull-ups so i'm already feeling myself slipping like i'm gonna be 45 next month and 
[01:53:30]  i'm like like he could be a dick and say that only eight of those counted yeah trying to get my big  head over that friggin it's just a strength you lose so quickly because you you don't do that at  any point during the day the only time you use those muscles is when you're literally doing a  pull-up right it's not like i don't know if you're laying on the floor you kind of do a push-up to get  up yeah you kind of do a sit up to get out of bed no reason to pull yourself up by your arm there's no 
[01:54:00]  reason to work on that muscle yeah i'm stuck in a river and there's a log above me that i have to  thank god i did my pull-ups in the gym thank goodness yeah but yeah i guarantee if you watch mine  maybe six out of ten would be no half acceptable not as you know you're downplaying i've been in the gym  with you it's crazy i don't understand how you could do so many pull-ups i don't like what you  know little guys i hate is the guys who do more pull-ups than me but they do that they're flopping  like a fish to get themselves over they do that little it's almost like they're doing that break  dance move the worm like they're doing it like hanging it's like that's like the guys who like 
[01:54:30]  they like they bounce the bar off their chest when they're benching i hate that or they don't go all  the way down those guys cheat yeah you cheat it i saw a prison video recently of a guy who's out of  jail now he's a massive massive guy and he was doing pull-ups but he was doing the pull-up and  then he would go to the the top of the bar and then push himself up those are cold muscle ups or  something oh fuck did that look hard because he's a big dude he probably how many how many just it 
[01:55:00]  didn't seem that hard for him and he did those things where you grab a straight bar and you and you  lift yourself out like a straight line like the middle of the letter h oh yeah you see guys i  can do that holy shit that's upper body strength how the fuck did i do that no it's actually it's  core oh is that core core strength oh wow how you have to do it i tried to get it it just wasn't  you had to do it every day and i i couldn't i just couldn't you you fucking grab grab it like  one hand i'm just so stupid to tell on the radio what you do is you actually have your knees in 
[01:55:30]  towards your chest the first time you do it so you're just trying to just bring it up like that  and then gradually straighten out over time and you have to go like you have to almost like bring  be it like a 45 degree angle and then sort of drop down right yeah i just literally could just feel  all the meat just leave my rib just pulling every little muscle oh yeah and that's just like there  would be no way to rehab it ever there's no like it's not like a pulled hamstring it's just like yeah you  just you pulled rib meat off of your ribs they can't put that back sorry mr burr that can't be 
[01:56:00]  put back one side of you is fine the other side's like pulled pork  no i'm into that type of shit yeah i got a a rope i climb a rope but i mean every time i go i go away  you know for like you know 10 days or whatever on the road and then i come back it's like i have to  fucking start over again so it's really yeah it's really you don't hit the gyms on the road yeah but  nobody has like a fucking rope that you can climb right terrible gyms especially the hotel gym 
[01:56:30]  elliptical treadmill or do you want to fucking live six pounds that's what they have right  three little things to do and they have these treadmills they got in like 1983  as you're walking on them you literally feel like i'm going to put my foot right  they're probably concerned about lawsuits oh we can't put any more than six pounds on  they're just cheap you know how to fucking hurt themselves it's all that it's all avoiding  lawsuits and uh not spending any money yeah yeah what do you mean you climb a rope every day 
[01:57:00]  not every day like every whenever how high up um not too too high because i'm not an idiot so what i  so what i do is i'll go up and when that gets too easy then i come halfway down and then i go back  up again so i'm never falling more than like whatever i mean it's still like old school high  school rope yeah wow where'd you get that fucking highschool rope dot com  look that shit up and anything online now it used to be scary to hit the beam 
[01:57:30]  in the gym when you climb the rope that was creepy as hell i never did and they allowed us to do that  with oh and they had that little say that quarter inch amf blue mat yeah yeah right yes you could  see why do they allow us to do that i'm sure now they probably have a harness that they you know i'm  talking about no i bet they don't even have it because of the liability yeah yeah i was it was it  was washington drive uh grammar school so we're 10 11 12 going all the way up to the beam in the gym  on a rope yeah we all did that but but yeah but and then you had to take take a hand off to tap the 
[01:58:00]  beam right and then slide down and get those third degree burns on the palms of your hands well you  got that nice feeling though if you did it right jeez felt it in your gut a little bit did you a  little flutter oh yeah jesus are you rubbing your clit on it i felt the flutter how the fuck is  rubbing your balls on a rope coming down no if you if you do it just right you'll feel a little  flutter i never got that no i uh hilarious absolutely petrified yeah what was the test 
[01:58:30]  called when we were in high school presidential physical fitness that's when i started doing  pull-ups because i had never done a pull-up in my life and i i remember i was just like telling my  muscles like and commence and my body was not even moving i was like it's like it was like i didn't  have them it was like trying to bend your leg the wrong way it was like i yeah i was i i think i did  three i did like three and they were fucking horrific and you had to do at least nine and it 
[01:59:00]  was already you know i was at that age you know where like you know some people still have high  pitch voices and somebody else has like a mustache you know and there was like those guys would just  crank it like some some kid did like 25 jesus and i was i was just like i have to do something about  this i can't be uh that's a great point it's not fair same age you could either be a man or still a  a fucking boy oh yeah no no no right yeah i was just hanging from the bar like  the kid with the five o'clock shot i was just ripping them oh yeah looks older than the gym 
[01:59:30]  teacher yeah yeah it's a little more inspiring during the presidential physical fitness test when  the president's in shape at the time in some amount of shape i had fucking dick nixon was in office  doing it so i heard it was it's not like what what the fuck what does he know about presidents  look like presidents back then though they looked yeah old right yeah yeah kind of want  them to look like that i don't know yeah ever since like bill clinton they've just kind of been like  yeah just guys yeah jogging riding bikes yeah yeah clearing clearing land yeah they're always clearing 
[02:00:00]  land yeah after jfk they were all fucking messes until uh yeah clinton i mean jfk and then you had  fucking johnson nixon well clinton turned around ford yeah he was the first one you really saw  exercising reagan they showed fucking what chomping down a tree or something cutting wood but that was  about it reagan was in amazing shape though yeah i know but they showed clinton running around the  white house and that whole area yeah yeah reagan they show getting shot after reagan got shot you're 
[02:00:30]  like all right i guess he's his own kind of fucking man yeah he gets a pass right back to work  it's amazing might get a fat president next we'll say have you ever been to the you got to go out to  his his ranch or what his life the reagan library oh yeah yeah my uh my parents when they came out  that's how conservative they are like they're coming out to hollywood and they want to go to the ronald  reagan reagan library library and just could they could give a shit about hollywood boulevard and  all or whatever sunset strip or whatever so i go all right so we went out there dude it's unbelievable 
[02:01:00]  yeah it's unbelievable first of all they have like the air force one that all the presidents flew  in like they retired the plane and they built this building around it jesus oh wow i don't realize  those places like yeah the huge museum right it was it was incredible it was could you go on the plane  yeah that alone yeah that's you just start thinking of the conversations yeah yeah god damn right that  happened on on uh on that plane i i of course can't remember anything that they said they just told 
[02:01:30]  the amount of times like when this happened they immediately scrambled air force one and they  brought the president up this could actually fly at a 50 000 feet or something insane yeah yeah it was  really uh did they have a sweatpants a picture came out recently sam if you can find it ronald reagan  and sweatpants on air force one yeah it's hilarious relaxing they're up way too high it's obviously never  wear sweatpants yes i'm trying to remember exactly a shirt and tie with a sport coat on top yes yes  something like that oh there it is look at this there it is god one click oh yeah yeah they're way 
[02:02:00]  too high william prowley pants all his balls are on the left side yeah yeah he has the tie what are you  doing he uh he's getting comfortable on air force one you know it is when you fly and you know if you  sit down too long you get all sweatpants ever my god was it nice on the plane yeah no dude it was it was  i mean it was definitely at this point i mean it's like a i don't know how old the plane was it was  definitely it was a lot of like the old technology i want to say i talked about this one time and uh 
[02:02:30]  yeah that was that time bobby kelly said something hilarious about the technology like like almost  like they were still using those phones or something and that the iphone somehow would  caught up to the government right yeah i do remember yeah something along those lines but  well you got to think they had all this technology at least 10 years ago the important people oh and  then i can't imagine giving it to us yeah of course i mean we're probably like three years  away from them just being able to control this like remotely right right like one of those games 
[02:03:00]  that sims game or whatever yeah yeah yeah but ronald reagan sweatpant picture sweat sweat he would  never go into the oval office without a suit jacket and tie on apparently the respect for the office  yeah old school that kind of went away with clinton fucking that's knob hop right there in the  old school or i think he was continuing a tradition yeah the kennedy tradition  yeah and i think i would imagine a couple others probably yeah right there who do you think's in 
[02:03:30]  that club the blowjob come on club the presidential uh how about we go who isn't who isn't who is  jimmy carter when you have that access i had lust in my heart jerald jerald ford  hmm not so much they're all fogies yeah lyndon johnson no they're the way lady bird  fucking ate his ass in the in the oval office oh god what a visual  what about nixon blowjob in uh the white house 
[02:04:00]  nixon yeah he looked like a real stick in the mud  uh he looked like he would get his freak on the pirate yeah you know jfk did that  fucking mimi beersley book where she's talking about how he fucking uh he  her upstairs in the white house like her second day as an intern or whatever like jfk utilized the  white house all right bill we got all the presidents to your right there for your uh viewing pleasure  pleasure without the names which makes it a little tougher after uh military man without a doubt 
[02:04:30]  after truman it gets tough recognizing these guys truman i would say definitely yeah fdr uh he was  in a wheelchair so that's kind of rough who's that before him hoover it might be govern taft i don't  know the names of these guys parting i don't know dude that's just such like when you look at all the  old presidents whoever the this guy is right here with the white hair after that they all kind of  use like grecian formula and it becomes like the more modern era yeah yeah look at that you're right 
[02:05:00]  yeah they had to look a little uh younger that's a whole power base thing you know you look a little  more vulnerable if you're all gray dude i have no idea okay there's a couple of guys that you know  like teddy roosevelt lincoln yeah washington and i know i don't like jefferson andrew jackson yeah  there's a quincy look at this john quincy adams taft who's the guy right under george washington  i don't know i think that's john quincy adams oh wow very good is it i think he's right 
[02:05:30]  it might be is that borman yeah i don't know yeah i'm not completely bald with a blowout right  down to the mutton trucks he does that's fucking larry fine hair yeah president larry fine  hey i'm warning you that was before they figured it out that you could just shave your head and get  rid of the blowout yeah what the blowout it really is it's like a lion went bald 
[02:06:00]  hey we have to adhere to the constitution  who was the one with the long beard i didn't realize we had a president with the really long  beard there who is that yeah see we don't know really that is terrible to not know  getting along his beard yeah you should probably know maybe there's only 40 something of them  look how young bill clinton and george w bush looked before they went through eight years of 
[02:06:30]  that job no kidding obama's looking real bad these days too if you look at when he was first uh elected  dude it is it is the worst job you could ever get you'll lose so many years but what we talk about  they they gain a couple years back after office when they show them after you know a couple of years off  they're like well we visited president or he showed up at this and that's because they're  they're doing those million dollars speaking gigs yeah yeah that's the payoff on the other end  right it really is because other than that there's no reason to do that that job pays like four and a 
[02:07:00]  grand a year terrible it costs a hundred million to get it or whatever you got to have security so  nobody blows your brains out anything happens in the country you get blamed and you make less than  a couple of bloggers on the internet like why would you do that job why you're right unless there's  that terrible job yeah well they showed bush recently he looks a lot younger he looks great  he looks like he gained a couple years back yeah i don't think there was ever anybody more  over it oh yeah he wanted no he doesn't want anything to do with it after he got out he has 
[02:07:30]  an excuse every time the presidents are supposed to get together yeah he bails out on a lot of that  very very busy riding a bike today i'm doing a marathon he's always doing something very energetic  what do you think that's about because he's the first one in a while he had one of the  fucking toughest presidencies ever in in recent history he was called a retard for eight years  by the entire nation while the world wanted to blow up the country yeah yeah fuck that yeah but he was 
[02:08:00]  also prolific as far as like giving you material oh every every if you're in office for eight years  you're gonna have like you know 10 dumb things you did he did 10 dumb things a month like i can't  defend that guy i'm not saying i'm any smarter than that guy he that was the joke i was doing  saying i liked him because he made me feel like i could be president too yeah yeah yeah look at that 
[02:08:30]  i don't know i'm before the arguments start i think he made his presidency pretty tough you think  he made it uh tough himself yeah i don't well you know something with this this last  that terrorists attacked up in boston i was like so relieved that it wasn't anybody from the middle  east because i swear to god like you just keep going after these guys with everybody it's like  literally 35 guys are gonna bankrupt this whole fucking country because every time you're gonna send  a billion dollars worth of troops to go get 19 guys in a fucking jungle gym it's just it's just 
[02:09:00]  like fucking eventually that's stupid video i'm like why can't training video why can't we just send  the fucking drones in yeah right and have guys from fucking what is it new mexico or arizona  yeah they're just fucking in some some shipping container that's been yeah i mean i realized  obviously it's got it's got to be way more difficult than that but it just i mean 
[02:09:30]  financially we're really we're doing another one of these things in august  yeah raise the debt ceiling again uh yeah yeah yeah yeah just do it again this this well no one's  working with anybody so now it's just everyone is posturing to fuck up the other side's midterm  election right now so nothing ever gets done it's it's just this country's um uh politicians and the 
[02:10:00]  whole political system is just ground to a halt it's ground to a hole no it's so fucked up i can't  even watch it i can't even talk about it because i just know it's like when i'm when is it all going  to collapse and when and what fema camp am i going to be let into and how long will it will i be in  there before i'm decided that i'm expendable expendable yeah yeah you're just uh you're just  eating up valuable resources did you see that 12 year old girl or whatever from canada breaking down  the banks no oh my god oh we gotta see that canadian yeah oh yeah it was great no she's breaking down 
[02:10:30]  canadian banks canadian banks so there's no reason to get nationalistic or anything right  people get very nationalistic about the canadians commenting on our our side of the border brings  up it says like a mortgage they considered a death note like you're basically we got you for life  yeah how long is this uh you know it's probably gonna what did it say we'll just catch it catch a  little bit of it make it big sam so we can see this youngster yeah where's the youngster yeah 
[02:11:00]  breaking down the banks do your thing do your thing here she comes have you ever wondered why  canada is in debt have you ever wondered why the government forces canadians to pay so many taxes  have you ever wondered why the bankers from the largest private banks are becoming wealthier and the  rest of us are not have you ever wondered she's a robot national debt it's over 800 billion dollars 
[02:11:30]  that's it or why we are spending 160 million dollars a day on the interest of the national debt  that's 60 billion dollars a year it's nothing compared to us by the way who receives the 60  billion dollars what i have discovered is the banks and the government have colluded to financially  enslave the people of canada dead before 15. i will share with you three important points of reference 
[02:12:00]  which will hopefully spark enough interest and concern for you to continue the research on your  own wow i can't believe there's not like a red dot coming on her forehead  first we will briefly examine the bank of canada second we will see how our banking system works today  and lastly i will offer a viable solution that we can petition our government to implement a very  little known figure in canadian history is jail grad and mcgear who he was a lawyer member of parliament 
[02:12:30]  and mayor of vancouver his contribution to canada is probably the greatest in our history he championed  the creation of the national bank she must be a chore this is their federal reserve is to create and  manage canada's money it was formed on july 3rd 1934 and owned by all canadians oh my fault  in the 1970s because of the bank of canada canada's national debt was held at a constant manageable level 
[02:13:00]  until the government government decided to implement what we now have as our modern day banking system  that is robbing the canadian people so how are they robbing us how does a 12-year-old do this  how our private banks and government work today first the canadian government borrows money from  the private banks they then lend the debt-based money to canada the government then continues to 
[02:13:30]  increase taxation of canadians year after year in order to pay back the interest on the exponentially  growing national debt what results is inflation that's real money for canadians to spend into our  economy and the real money being used to pad the pockets of the bank oh boy this is any american  is the game doesn't exist in the form of loans this is obviously when a bank gives you a mortgage  which literally means a death pledge or a loan they don't actually give you money they click a key 
[02:14:00]  on a computer and generate the fake money out of thin air they don't actually have it in their bank vaults  presently the banks only have four billion dollars on reserve but they have loaned over 1.5 trillion  dollars loaned out to quote graham towers each and every time a bank makes a loan a new bank credit is 
[02:14:30]  created new deposits brand new money broadly speaking all new money comes out of a bank in the form of  loans as loans are debt then under the present system all money is debt i don't know how much  we want to listen to this this kid's great she's nailing it though obviously it's an adult who  figured look there's less chance they're going to kill a 12 year old girl right so you say this right  for us say it for us please yeah yeah no that's it you ever think i was thinking about like i got the 
[02:15:00]  loan for my house it's like i never had you never had the money all of a sudden i just get this statement  with this number on it yeah and it's like you owe us this and they never had the money dude this is how  nuts it is when i had the i had water damage on my house so uh and i had insurance so when the check  came it came it was made out to me uh my girl and fucking the the mortgage company so i'm like why 
[02:15:30]  is it also made out to these guys so i'm like i gotta get them to sign the back of this thing to  where are they who do i go to you know right so i call them up and they go oh no you guys signed  the check over to us and we hold on to the money and i go wait a minute i go it's my insurance why  are you guys holding on to the money and they go well because we have a vested interest in the  property so do i and i guess i just said i go so do i i live there and then they basically just kept 
[02:16:00]  going no if it's over ten thousand dollars in damage it's it's our policy that we hold on to the  money and i go i kept saying why and and she goes it's our policy and i go i know why she goes i just  told you why i go no you didn't i'm i know it's your policy i'm saying why does that policy exist  and i basically broke her down to the point this is what happened they fucked over so many people  by loaning them 250 grand for a house that's only worth a buck 80 now and people were so 
[02:16:30]  fucked and they were going to lose their houses that when they had 10 grand worth of damage and  they got the check they go like i'm not putting into this sinkhole and they kept the money and bought  like a dodge challenger and had a keg party or whatever the fuck they did right bought some air  jordans so then the banks would get the houses back with the hole in the fucking roof that they had  to fix so they don't trust me because they've fucked people so bad they don't trust me that i'm going to  do the right thing on my own house so they're literally treating me like a child so i have to  give them the money and i have to do a third of the job have the workers stop and then they have to 
[02:17:00]  have a worker come over to check the quality to make sure holy sure you're not just on the cheap  right patching it up and pocketing so this is why this is all i do is i just knock down the principle  because i i hate having people having that level of control over me let me ask you a question about  this though because i did the same thing with my my loan i got a loan from the bank for x amount to pay  off this to buy this place so but when they gave me that loan uh 10 percent of equity and the other 80  percent of fucking uh what a regular rate uh it went to the guy who i bought the place from but 
[02:17:30]  then he had the money so when she's saying that the money doesn't exist like but like if that guy  wanted to withdraw all that money he could have and it came from my bank like you know this this is  the thing but through taxes and penalties you can do whatever you want with your money but they're  going to ass rape you they basically through the taxes and penalties they funnel you down  down this same shoot like it's unbelievable like you like the money that i put i foolishly put into  the stock market like i don't even look at it like i'm ever going to get it back like i i get it back 
[02:18:00]  when i'm like 70 yeah it's like oh you can take it out now but we're going to charge you we're going  to ass rape you yeah we're going to charge you or you can just leave it leave it just leave it in  there so um i don't know like but this is the thing though so say whatever say like if you have if you  ever go to like you know if you sold a house for 800 grand and then you go to the bank uh you know  i want that 800 grand in cash like that's gonna take a couple of days because they don't have it  no it's not there they don't have like vault full of golden cash cash stacks there's nothing i don't 
[02:18:30]  know there's just like the bullshit that they stick into atms i would think yeah yeah just to keep  the the other because other than that now it's great is everybody uses the debit cards and checks so  now again now we don't even have to have the phony stuff just numbers it's all numbers you  you work all week you get a number on this piece of paper you stick it in the thing and there's the  number goes there that number goes there yeah i know what jim's saying but here's here's the deal  jim yeah you buy a place you get a loan from the bank and it you know money goes to the guy that uh 
[02:19:00]  that there and for the most part again it's just numbers transferred from account to account if  every single seller of the house wanted cash there wouldn't be a problem right and also so  much loans out they don't have that money right no and they can legally when you when you if you  deposit a thousand bucks they could legally loan off that thousand one thousand dollars to each one  of us so they like counterfeit another four grand that doesn't even exist and if you got your 800 
[02:19:30]  grand what are you gonna do stick it in the mattress you're gonna go stick it in a bank and they got  it back yeah that's the fear of being armed robbed is you just you put in the bank just so  nobody can break any place there to get no interest at this point i was in the bank yesterday opening  an account for a new corporation or new llc i was offering she's like we could open a savings account  and she was nice and i'm like i'm so disgusted with the bank of america they they incorporate they  did my corporate or my company through this bank so i'm opening a checking account there but i'm like 
[02:20:00]  i've done i put all my money in this one place to invest it you guys i said not you personally but  are reprehensible the computer records and the fact that uh you've messed up my final mortgage payment  and i had to go through it with the bank man they just they fucking stink all of them they uh yeah  they they try to get me every time when i i'm depositing or taking something out of my my checking  account and i have you know i have enough in there to to around buy some dinosaurs for my yard and whatnot 
[02:20:30]  uh so so they always go like oh yeah i see your balance here do you want to you know talk about  an account this it's like really what are you going to give me like what could they possibly  offer me half a percent that's what they're offering so that's about it i like when they'll  call me up and be like you know you're eligible to refinance your mortgage and uh you know get the  lower interest rate it's like yeah but then i i start off at payment number one you're sending me 
[02:21:00]  all the way back to the start line again for 30 years and it's just like do you think i'm an idiot  the guys go no well this would be a lower mortgage i go dude there's no way you you're sitting at a  bank going how can i make less money off this guy it's like i can't intellectually break down what  you're doing but i know what your job is less payments for me less money for me to pay you every  month it's not like i called him up and i figured it out oh wait i can refine he's calling me he's  fucking guy's calling me like a psycho like six times i finally picked up i'm just like why why 
[02:21:30]  do you keep calling me about this why oh you just want to make sure that you get the book no you  don't it's got to be in their favor you could be paying less every month yeah that's like those goes  back to that thing i would talked about with those savey save cards at those things it's just like  people it's like do you think that cvs and these people are going how can we make less fucking money  off of these goddamn people bill breaks it down perfectly do you have a cvs card no no do you want  one and that's what i love too when then and then when you pay with the credit card then you just 
[02:22:00]  watch them they'll just grab a random one and swipe it there for you yes and it's like why the  fuck did you just i just said i i want to pay more money for this right and you did that because  you're taking my personal information they just i think they like sell it to other companies like  he loves this toothpaste he loves the toothpaste what can we get for that you want to know what kind  of toothpaste this guy likes like dude and absolutely don't give him your number ever don't give  them the information they get it they've always swiped their own right when they're like you got  a cvs card no oh we happen to have one right here i'll just do this for you and just do this and it 
[02:22:30]  goes out on the fucking you know your your credit card info's got everything so then you're getting  junk mail you're getting fucking shit so this is what i do i pay cash and but i it's like uh it's like  texas hold'em like or whatever like you don't show the credit card or the cash like oh i don't have  it and then you act like you're gonna fucking swipe a card and then they do the little boop with the cvs  thing and then bam i slap i'm a ghost good you don't know me he's off the grid he's off the grid 
[02:23:00]  and that right there guys now you get the discount on the deodorant i love it with that we should  take a break very funny bill burr is at the count basie theater tonight in red bank uh red bank new  jersey tickets available um probably they'll probably have a few releases not many man i would imagine  piss you motherfucker yeah we all gotta piss i'm not taking that god damn read look we're all over the  country and so is bill burr so for uh tour dates bill burr.com is the easiest place to go and we'll  continue with bill burr next the opian anthony show sirius xm the opian anthony show is back

[02:24:30]  holy no i am dude i'm trying like that's my retirement i just yeah i'm gonna just pay that  thing off and then someday you know when this business is done with me i'll just sell it  uh i don't know what just go live live off the land well live on one of those silver trailers yeah  at this point if i'm not you know we're not in a police state and i'm required to live in a mega city  i love it i can't stand the fact that you're you're never done you're never done with this  shit like when you say oh i'm retiring or i'm doing this you're still filling out the second 
[02:25:00]  your paperwork and taxes and and things you're still you're still accountable to the government  for your property tax oh i paid my house off oh you did how about if you don't pay your property tax  they'll just take your house that you paid off that you bought that is your house really no the  reason why it's so long too is it's so brilliant because by the time you get it finished you're  so old it's just like the kids are out of the houses i can't go up the stairs anymore and then you 
[02:25:30]  sell it for some you know whatever and you get out price yeah liver fails or whatever and you're  out and then they get another 30 35 year old and they fucking put that death note on him i like dude  if if you it just freaks you out like you drive everything you look at they own yeah and even if  they don't own it they're getting it back when whoever owns it dies so and however much it costs  it took so fucking long to pay it off yeah dude and what kills me is it's just it's what  fucking kills it'd be one thing if they were like these these fucking gangsters yeah they look 
[02:26:00]  like you know those ufc guys with the shaved head it's just like that guy's gonna snap my neck i'm  not gonna say shit i got it just walk into a bank and look at these cunts on the other side of the  desk a little i'm not saying some of them don't go down to a dojo i'm not saying but i'm just saying  to have this level of of of power is just it yeah it kills you but i don't think the level of power  is on the people that you or me see on a daily basis they're just slobs like we are trying to 
[02:26:30]  eek a living by it's uh it's the unnamed people it's the people that you know it's the person that's  what was written on that check of yours who is that what a consortium a fucking building this is the  thing i always came in and talked about that shit you guys were always saying that i was going down  the fucking rabbit hole and i was nuts and i'm not tell you i i remember when i i tweeted you rolling  stone actually did i mean they're fucking so left it's ridiculous yeah but they were saying like  apology to conspiracy as far as that went right you know not the lunar landing and all that 
[02:27:00]  shit they because they they were kind of breaking down how all of this stuff works and uh like i  actually want one point i was sitting um talking to a banker at my bank and we started talking about  that shit and he was like lowering his voice he's just going like he's literally going like yeah man  you know it's insane have you ever seen like that that zeitgeist thing like you ever like  no that was the 911 one i don't know what the fuck it was but he started talking about it too  and it's like this guy this guy he and it's like how can you be in this he's in the machine but you 
[02:27:30]  don't even he's just a fucking no he's a wing nut on the back but the reason why he stays in it  is he's his money is stuck in it too yes he has a death note it's and he's literally sitting there  like shining darth vader's shoes every day because that's that's how he fucking makes his money and  he's sitting there like i almost got nervous like you know somebody's going to step out of a wall and  both of us you know chloroform rag and we're going to disappear it's like dude not here not here  are we supposed to be doing the joe pesi with a hand over our mouth 
[02:28:00]  sitting in a garage with the radio on  no i i am i am with you we used to fucking sit here and go oh bill oh bill i think everyone's  all in now it's so obvious and out there now i'll tell you one of the greatest things you'll ever do  too is have joe rogan talk to you for maybe 43 seconds about why the lunar landing didn't happen  and you're just 100 convinced it's the greatest thing he was going he goes bill all the technology 
[02:28:30]  we have we had three stage rockets to get us out of this he goes so how the fuck did that thing get  back off of the moon what's that little the top part that's just left how the fuck did it well you  have barely the gravity that we have of earth and and no no atmosphere to speak of for uh friction  with the air yeah so yeah oh yeah that's the bill i love oh yeah all right i agree with the banks but 
[02:29:00]  now you're back to talking crazy well who who filmed it when it takes off from the  fucking moon and that and that camera pans up yeah they set a camera there is that what they did  yeah that what they did what did that camera look like because i remember what that  fucking camera looked like in 1988 what exactly did that fucking camera look like it was a big  boxy typewriter looking thing that you could control silver my lovely yeah it was yeah from 
[02:29:30]  what from the lunar module it had it was able to track the lunar module as it took off jesus with  this star trek horseshit you know what should be going on right now as you tell this story that  sound effect of when the doors opened on the stars trip  no i i completely uh believe it and i don't even know what i'm talking about he starts talking about  solar flares yeah and this shit where it's just like i don't know these blasts of fire just go  through space can we find this it's it's now next time joe comes in i don't want to put him on the 
[02:30:00]  spot but i sat there people he really believes it didn't happen it's standard but i'm like me he  actually he's probably wanting to punch me in the face because he's actually read up on it we had buzz  aldrin and just what last week two weeks ago the guy in the face for saying that it didn't happen  no no no no he punched him in the face because he called him a coward and he's from that generation  where them's fighting words them's fighting words i gotta tell you this right now i gotta commend 
[02:30:30]  that doughy jackass that he because i took that punch i would have gone down he fucking nailed that  dude you know that's what i love you see like that dude's back fat like ripples yeah yeah he just  took i was right right i almost think because he caught him so flush in the face it's almost like  taking a bump in wrestling where you have it go all across your back somehow across his face  yes sam no that would have been it from i think i think joe rogan it's it's the same  shit i've heard for years it's nothing new it's the same we didn't land on the moon stuff and it's 
[02:31:00]  all been refuted by not just nasa by other scientists that have absolutely viable solutions as to  uh why we were on the moon and why every one of these reasons that we weren't has been no but i  don't want to hear it from them that's like somebody's accused of murder and he'll tell you  why he didn't do it i want to hear somebody outside of that you know i'm so full of shit i don't even  want to talk to him i'm just tapping what do you got on this sam yeah i don't sam's got something i  don't believe i think everything's bullshit i think everything is now that uh moon landing was probably 
[02:31:30]  real oh rogan yeah he went back they got to him yeah they got to well you listen to somebody give  an argument as to why it didn't happen it makes me like wow that guy that's fucking right it never  happened yeah and then you hear somebody who knows what they're talking about refute it you go oh  i guess it did yeah that's how i felt when i first i i watched one about why it didn't happen i'm like  fuck that's very compelling well jimmy's a jfk uh one guy did it oswald guy yeah but i wasn't for  many years one guy the current uh this is you change your your your oh i argue your complete 
[02:32:00]  opinion in favor of conspiracy forever hard forever now you're convinced it was just oswald yes this  is uh coming from dr steve by the way uh amateur um astronomer space buff amateur amateur physician  pederast uh the current mars orbiter took pictures of the serious s-i-r-i-u-s apollo landing sites  uh i i suppose those are fake too though no no i'm sorry not the mars orbiter of course the moon 
[02:32:30]  orbiter yes did they have the car did they take a just take a picture of the car just to shut me up  a picture of the the lunar landing site they have pictures of the car they do they they they were  able to actually take pictures of those things and uh the the uh lunar orbiter did take pictures  there were pictures online okay but the banks yeah banks find pictures of uh lunar uh landing 
[02:33:00]  sites yeah find lunar landing site dude what is that story bieber accused of reckless driving  ex-nfl star keishon johnson he lives in keishon johnson's neighborhood yeah bieber's been  with one of his sports cars just fucking darting up and down the the streets  yeah justin bieber go to the track so keishon johnson chased him down and then held him until  the cops showed up he held him yeah he held him physically hold him or just stand in front of  his car i'm not sure exactly but he basically made sure biebs uh didn't leave till the cops showed up 
[02:33:30]  so they could discuss it no fight there oh my god little brawl there isn't that great oh come on  now it looks silly because there's nothing there sam i can't astronaut footprints scientific instruments  what limb you can't see in a lunar module that's the back of a nestle that's the shadow  they just shot it in black and white  i can see the lunar uh platform right there the lunar module platform no you can't why 
[02:34:00]  because there's a thing that says lunar module and there's an arrow pointing to it that is true  it's hard to tell that is uh very hard to tell it's the apollo 14 site uh oh there's just oh  there's the scientific instruments  i like i like better pictures yeah a little clearer yeah hey dr steve stand down that's an  old picture that couldn't be a new picture that has to be an old photo oh that's gonna be apollo  14 all right no no no sorry no that was that's the apollo 14 site as taken by something else oh i 
[02:34:30]  don't know what though yeah that's a horrible or perhaps it was from the command module i think  that was from uh apollo 14 charlie chaplin's flip phone right the old flip phone that the guy's  walking around with in the old they have a few of those now uh online they found more they have  video of like something a film taken back in the 20s and 30s and stuff and it's like look at those  persons on their cell phone they're not they wouldn't be walking around in front of everybody 
[02:35:00]  else yeah i i tell you not to call me in this fucking era i'm in the 1920s yeah what are you  doing dude can i call you back can i call you back i'm dealing with prohibition yeah we got a guy that  has a little more on the rogan thing uh robert go ahead buddy yeah i hope um yeah uh neil degrasse  tyson or neil tyson degrasse whatever that uh astrophysicist was on rogan's show and he's the  one that convinced rogan rogan was talking about the film and how he believed that the different  film clips were faked up on the moon and uh the physicist pointed out that to fake the video 
[02:35:30]  to make everything in that environment react the way it would in a weightless environment actually  took more science to do that than it would have actually taken to have gotten to the moon  yeah i i just a conspiracy of that magnitude and then that's that's how it always falls apart  me when it gets to the point of how many people would have to be involved and everybody keeps  their mouth one person talks again why do it six times all right i'm an idiot like if you got away 
[02:36:00]  with it once with apollo 11 wouldn't you be like all right that's it for the lunar program  you don't do it again six more fucking times yeah and fake it and no one talks all of those times  it's so ludicrous to think i know but the banks the banks i agree with the banks  yeah that was the soda can they said a lot of the moon people say there was a soda can in the  original clip you could see it in the foreground oh my god oh they have the most nonsensical 
[02:36:30]  shit yeah did you see that kid from philly i retweeted the video when he he was talking about  how he found the real bombers in boston and he just took like a he just had a picture of a guy  with a backpack and he ends it like talking shit what did he did he say he said something like uh  something like boom nailed it or i can't remember what he said like was it one of those like the  amateur investigators that were all over the fucking internet during the the bombing it was like they 
[02:37:00]  took crowd shots and like this no that's what i love like because i'm not i'm an i'm an idiot but  i'm not a complete idiot like i'm not gonna sit there and listen to somebody who's who's compiling  news footage versus experts who are actually at the site it's like yeah but if you look at this clip  from fucking cnn yeah yeah look at this guy here his backpack is uh looks very heavy his mannerisms  are not indicative of somebody yeah yeah look now he doesn't have the backpack on well you can't see it  he's behind somebody yeah but if you could you could see he didn't maria's coming all right who

[02:43:30]  be under her dress it was just that's still a nice ass you know yeah it's still shapely it's a little  more padded but i might have to compromise if the number was big enough yeah that's right  yeah so you never know no let's think about it like at some point you can sit here and say all  you want that i would never do that blah blah blah but when you realize how smart that is that you  just did that so they can never pull the audio yeah i'll be like you saying that she's not sincere  about that that's not why i did but yeah no no she's got to worry about that stuff very smart 
[02:44:00]  it's true though when you when you have kids to support it's the things change in your mind a  little bit so i guess hey no i always said that like i would never there's a few things i was just  like you know i'll never do i'll never do now i'm getting older i'm getting tired yeah i'm just like  yeah fuck it yeah nothing is worse than hearing fucking joe thighs been crying about his prostate and  having to piss at every event he's at yeah why would he do that terrible i know hey you know my  prostate's giving me a oh a world of hurt i used to have to make sure the bathroom was real close 
[02:44:30]  sign a couple more football exactly you know what i mean john heisman signed football come on  why would you do that so sorry he uh loves it yeah we went off on a tangent  yeah i uh yeah what is your movie about oh adventures of cereal buddies um it's called the  adventures of cereal buddies i know and it's uh about these two nitwits on a road trip who are 
[02:45:00]  killing people for different reasons they find out they're not on the same page by the end of the trip  and uh it was best described as dumb and dumber meets dexter i think i like this but they don't do  that thing where they only kill the bad people uh like on dexter that's why i had to leave because  it was like the serial killer with the heart of gold that's what jimmy said too one of them kills  people because he feels like he's giving them safe passage that they are evil doers um and then the 
[02:45:30]  other one is killing them because they precipitate well the other one kills because he's a trophy maker  and he doesn't have enough shelf space so he's kind of targeting athletes  multi-sport athletes it's a little messed up all right  i kind of got lost i got lost in the he's a he makes trophies trophy works in a trophy shop yeah  it's we actually use a location i used to work at a trophy shop 
[02:46:00]  um not so he's killing athletes so he doesn't have to make as many trophies yeah because he doesn't have  enough shelf space oh he's a little messed up wow i see now i like that yeah it's a little twisted  yeah it sounds twisted why does he just like get a bigger place it's pretty big already yeah well  you know when you hear the story his partner you know um killed himself uh before because you know  he had too much going on and so he doesn't want to end up like him and who do you play i play uh one 
[02:46:30]  of the sorority girls alongside beth bears from two broke girls and we happen to encounter them along  the way so and kathy lee gifford's our den month den mother are you in danger no oh no i'm annoyed  by them because they are doing you guys obviously saw animal house right uh-huh okay you know the  animal house plan when they come in and they find the dead sorority sister and they pretend to um  um what is it they i can't even remember the scene yeah they make believe uh yeah they one dude was

[02:48:00]  93 oh jesus oh 93 and i was 25 by then i was i transferred there i was a uh it was i was a 22  year old freshman oh really convicted drunk driver my whole life was just was over but you got to  emerson no no emerson turned it all around that's a great school then i started yeah that's how you  know uh yeah it all worked out oh yeah she's like becoming like my life coach now um there you go 
[02:48:30]  another emerson grad good deal i just went up there for the uh the evie awards you know the things that  they have up there it was good good time good time did you feel kind of like out of place uh being a  freshman as a yeah no when i when i took like the core requirement classes yeah there's such a big  difference between an 18 year old and a 22 year old i felt like i was with children i was literally  embarrassed it's like wow when i got i got there in like january of 91 and i did three years of college  by uh december of 92 and then i walked in 93 i went straight through yeah summer all of that i started 
[02:49:00]  doing uh oh yeah my college career was ridiculous i i didn't go to any parties nothing i was unloading  trucks that was a loser yeah no i did i had all your fun before which is good then you go to  emerson you pay a shitload of money and you get it all done that's right nice that was basically  that's basically what it is i don't like i don't know anybody like i would never go to reunion i don't  know anybody's name oh god we never knew this about bill what was your degree in communications 
[02:49:30]  probably yeah mass communication and then i i did radio because i was so i was so introverted and i  wanted to be a comedian but i was afraid to go on the mic real people so i just remember wcb do they  have that so i i was i was basically broadcasting only to these dorms and i had the 3 a.m to 6 a.m  shift and i would just that was dinosaur junior with blah blah blah right and i would actually ask  for requests at like four in the morning no so at one point i just was like oh god people call 
[02:50:00]  somebody yeah somebody call up just tell me you hate me something and the phone lit up and i picked  it up and some guy goes i hate you no and hung up on me dude and i was sitting there like then i just  catastrophized in my head that everyone in the dorms was listening and they all thought that i  sucked oh no no it turned out it was the boyfriend of of the girl who was coming in for like the next  shift and he was and he was just around no one else and he called me back she said to say i'm sorry  so i'm sorry it was the worst wow sorry i'm running my mouth was supposed to be promoting a movie here 
[02:50:30]  what was your uh what did you degree in uh i studied broadcast journalism and film  i got my job before i graduated so i said how did it work out for you  it worked out yeah i think so did you get your job through contacts you made  there or was it had nothing to do with school it actually you know what when i went to school  i felt like i was um kind of missing out on the whole networking thing because i never did  and then you know there were all these you know people that were like oh my god i totally have a 
[02:51:00]  job when we graduate my friend's friend's dad works here and works there and i'm gonna be at  e and i'm like oh my god i would look at my boyfriend kevin i'm like did i fuck up right  can i say that yeah yeah yeah um i'm like i think i screwed up i think that i didn't spend my  time like networking i i was so busy like studying and working and doing all that stuff and being  involved in things and he's like you'll be fine you'll be fine well the film that i worked in while 
[02:51:30]  i was in college one of the guys was a pa at channel one and he called me and he was friends  with my boyfriend he's like they're looking for tv anchors that's how it works and so i got the call  but he was a pa it's not like he had any power he just told me about it so luckily i worked on the  right project met a person that had you know the right knowledge and it kind of happened from there  i don't think anyone actually goes through all the schooling goes through like sending out the  resumes or or going on auditions whatever it is and gets a job there it's always like some freak 
[02:52:00]  meeting or some weird networking thing or nepotism but never it's never just but if i didn't go to  emerson it would have never happened because i if i didn't go to emerson say i'd gone to bu for example  like i wanted to originally for broadcast journalism i got in but emerson gave me more money so i had to go  where the money was be used way more expensive yeah and so i wouldn't have had the option to do  film well i ended up meeting kevin who came back to boston to make his movie and i started volunteering 
[02:52:30]  that summer and i was like oh i like this film thing and i was able to now add that to my major  and add those classes in well had i not worked on that i would have never gone into those classes and  learned what i learned and you know it's just there's a series of things yeah exactly but it's actually  true you never know you never know and so i because i was prepared i met the opportunity  you know why that freaks me out sometimes the only reason why i ended up doing stand-up was because 
[02:53:00]  a guy i worked with wanted to do it too and it stopped being on tv because like you know back in  the day remember it's just like hollywood was a zillion miles away yeah like you could make youtube  it seemed videos and it seemed impossible impossible so he was just like you know what he goes these  guys aren't funny one of these nights i'm gonna take a shot at jack daniels and i'm going on stage  then all of a sudden i'm just like this is this guy like i can do better than him you can just do  it do it where is that guy what's he doing yeah um i don't know i lost touch i don't know i was  really hoping you guys would avoid it they always go with the thing 
[02:53:30]  you know what happened to that guy yeah he probably met the love of his life when he's  got a great job and he's not in this horrific business you know you're pretty happy yeah  didn't have to do stand-up on a boat during a prom got a death got a death nice big death note  it's funny we've been uh we started shooting our reality show the last two weeks and i said to them 
[02:54:00]  i go you know i have all this crazy footage of me when i was younger saying all this crazy stuff like  someday i'm gonna go to hollywood someday i'm gonna do this someday i'm gonna do that i go i think  there's something you can do with this i mean i'm definitely not a writer but i feel like having  someone kind of predict the future on camera when they're 18 or whatever is kind of interesting  and so there's one um interview i was doing i was uh being interviewed for like miss  massachusetts teen usa or something and uh they said i got interviewed for that too yeah 
[02:54:30]  they asked me something i was like you know i always thought and this is my deep boston accent you  know hollywood was like so far away and unattainable but i'm here to say that you know dreams do come  true and i know someday that i'm gonna make it if i work hard like all this stuff i'm saying and i'm  like and my hair is in a bun i'm 40 pounds heavier i'm this like little kid and i'm saying all this  stuff and i'm like that's freaking crazy like it happened everything i said crazy you're from 
[02:55:00]  massachusetts how did you get rid of that accent it went away the first day i went on camera  come on crazy and then it would fall back so i would go on camera and i'd feel like i have to  be professional and then the second the camera would be off i would be like potty in and talking  like this again and you know and then my producers would get nervous when i got to la and you know  because that was on camera at emerson on like our school news but then when i went to channel one  every so often i would slip back and they're like you're not going to do it are you can't do that 
[02:55:30]  no no i'm fine don't worry don't worry because then it just stays what was that horrific  class you had to take you what that was like voice and articulation oh my god it was the worst  voice and articulation and you'd go up they try to teach you was a career speech yeah oh my god  it's just what is the hell is this in my brain career speech like basically you know on the news  like her like you can't tell where she's from not at all yeah that's the goal so that's so  she obviously passed the class i never did no i mean i did but i just remember the first day they 
[02:56:00]  just have you read from a book wow you know really and then they try to get you hey you have to read  out loud yeah and i remember there was this this kid drove me nuts he had vocal fry was what it's  called this when you don't push enough air through your voice box and he would he would talk like this  and then and then they would just be like you got to push more air out and he would just continue to  talk like that but louder for our scar and seven years ago was every time he went up there like  i literally i wanted to murder this kid i still remember this pudgy kid right 
[02:56:30]  you're not scared by any kids in class no man none that i could think of right dally dually with the  big head oh yeah we all had those they were doing something called um was it mainstreaming  or or something it was some experimental thing where they put mentally uh and physically uh challenged  kids in the same classes as the normal kids yeah who are at the meanest point in their life 
[02:57:00]  smart enough to come up with the insult but not mature enough to be like i shouldn't do that  oh that's good right that's a good program right but i wasn't a mean kid or anything but i was  like traumatized by some of these kids because i mean i'm talking you know it was a while back  so this like thalidomide babies were in my class with little flipper arms and a giant head and  fucking what is it what it's like thalidomide they used to give it to women that were kind of um 
[02:57:30]  apt to miscarriage and they would give them this drug thalidomide and uh i thought i was crazy for  not knowing i was like trying to figure it out i'm like did i hear it wrong oh no he's got it it  fucked kids up it gave them birth defects where they had the little flipper arms where they'd have  big giant water on the brain heads and and one kid had this eye it was like a goat's eye the pupil  was like straight across and and i i'm like eating multiple kids in your class with this yes it was 
[02:58:00]  crazy it was like i grew up in chernobyl they're just fucking we're older than you they've cured a lot  of this yeah the the prenatal screening process these days is amazing they could tell they could  tell people very early on genetically what's going to happen with the kids and then they do you know  amnio tests and could tell this that back then it was just you know pop would be there with a cigar  ready to light it rolling to die going hey hoping for the best oh you crapped out dad look at that 
[02:58:30]  you do know what show you're on right okay oh it's terrible yeah and then as kids and you asked by  the way there were a lot of maria's weird handicaps back then you asked i asked well yeah you asked about  the weird kids but it traumatized his pizza off he scraped the cheese off his pizza and he hated when  you'd blow air in his face like if you we would all go up to him go and he would go stop bothering me  and scratch his face god yeah he was great so you kept doing it all we did there was this kid named 
[02:59:00]  patrick fullens and he was patrick fullen was like a chubby kid yeah because she's a she's a good  person you can tell she should be horrified he made faces when he punched you in the stomach  i don't know why you would want to go blow in the kid's face after he's like freaking out  the same part we think this is terrible yeah we were young i mean we're young and stupid  so you pass me water thank you it was awful we used to punch a kid in the stomach because  he made a funny face when you did it it was this pat patrick fullen this little pudgy kid 
[02:59:30]  and and a little gang would get him against the wall and he'd sit there and and then  he'd punch him in the stomach and he'd go like oh like he made a funny face  so every day all day long they would just to see the face this was stomach just to see the face  but it's terrible of course it is but this was before they invented the word bullying but it wasn't  bullying it was you know what the word was oh please they used to take me i was one of two greeks 
[03:00:00]  in the school and me and this kid dino and they used to smush us together in the school yard and  they're like you're greeks you need to stick together and get married and kiss and i'm like  i'm like 10 like what are you doing or nine whatever and they would like smush us and they  would like not talk to us you know so me put them up to it could you smush us together  here's my lunch money smush me into her  we tied this kid to a tree and we've been throwing fireworks at him 
[03:00:30]  so my brother took the firecracker and had one of those short wicks and we will you had to light  him and we just don't want it close to him he was freaking out with and it was just fun  yeah it was fun it was terrible and and he he lit the thing and he and he went back to like throw it  like a football and it blew up in his hand i remember that did it fuck his hand up or  i remember he was just you know you know you just poured water on everything when you were younger  yeah yeah so you just poured yeah yeah and he was uh he was he ended up we used to go in the  we used to go in the woods with a foam rubber from a couch and light it on fire and hold it up 
[03:01:00]  and it would go it would make like the sound when it would it was like bubbling burning rubber falling  and when it was on fire it would sound like and it was cool until it hit me in the wrist  one thing a blob of it hit me on the wrist i ran out of the woods like that girl in vietnam  the picture with your fucking napalms i was screaming game over oh did that hurt 
[03:01:30]  i like high-pitched scream crying my friends are just like and then i when it finally stopped  hurting i'm like oh that'll never go away now i have to move i have to go back they're gonna  remember my fucking pussy baby crying as you're running out of the woods yeah why why did they  boo you when you inducted bob backland oh man you're a big wrestling fan right yeah you know  to set this up properly you're a big wrestling fan and you uh part-time diva you inducted bob backland 
[03:02:00]  into the hall of fame and that's jimmy's favorite wrestler is it really oh yeah well here's the thing  i i realized when they made the announcement people were starting to send me like hate tweets like why  are you inducting bob backland and i'm like so then i finally was like okay i need to let people know  that we've been friends for a long time so i tweeted some stuff and then people were like oh okay that  kind of makes sense and i figured when they heard the speech they would realize how close we've been  all these years and so a little bit is my fault because i let the speech go on too long i i think 
[03:02:30]  i wrote too long how long was it i don't remember wait wait wait wait i gotta hold on i gotta stop you  though how did you become friends with bob backland that seems like a weird combination i know well uh when i  was making my first film with kevin kevin um had brought backland to mtv and put him on singled  out back in the day and so he had maintained a relationship with him we cast him in our movie and  he came and shot it and of course i met him there and became friends with him and he came to my pageant 
[03:03:00]  when i was in miss mass and things like that so we've you know we helped him run for congress  we helped him with his run like we've been friends for years okay so now fast forward you got the intro  so fast forward they they um they called me up and they said mr backland would like you to induct him  and i was hoping that that would be the case because secretly i i wanted to because i feel like  you know there's there's a lot of people that could have done it but would they have given him  the the props that he really deserved for what he did like i get misty-eyed and so i don't know if 
[03:03:30]  they would like you have to really know him and really have like you know so the fans probably  wanted like another like tony guerrilla or they wanted so many people like who would you have  wanted being a backland fan uh probably would have uh sergeant slaughter slaughter that was another one  yeah somebody really unpleasant and so and the thing is he asked for me and so i'm not gonna say  no obviously and i i was excited to do it and so i worked really really hard to make sure like 
[03:04:00]  you know the speech is perfect kevin helped me with it and um i think it just went a little  too long the crowd gets a little restless gets a little tired especially if it's somebody they  didn't really get why you were there but it actually turned around because people were really mad that  i got booed and so the the the fans were mad at the fans inside that were booing and so they kept  saying like that they were really embarrassed by them so when you got booed did you keep going did you 
[03:04:30]  plow through there you go see that yeah emerson so you have to you learned that at emerson we  learned that at emerson bill had a moment yeah that's right that was bill had a moment a few years  back the one the ones that got mad at you for uh or mad at them for booing i call them uh on twitter  i call them white knights they're the guys that now let's say you you tweeted something and somebody  tweeted retweeted you and said something nasty about you guys will fly in bashing the guy that that  bashed you on this odd chance that you're gonna fucking like oh thank you oh and some relationship 
[03:05:00]  is going to spark twitter white knights and they're the biggest fucking losers the worst  phonies i can't stand up she's like a sister to me it's like a cock block bashing around regardless of  you know guy girl or whatever the fuck it is and when i do i don't need some fucking guy thinking his  dream is going to come true and she's going to knock on your door and thank you for saving her  from this twitter villain yeah and so i call them out i stick them on them sometimes i call 
[03:05:30]  for the white knights i'm like hey look what this guy just said oh yeah believe me we've done that  too on twitter attack yeah last night there was that asshole that was getting on jimmy and all i  did was like hey guys release the kraken yeah and boy jimmy what happened last night piled on  i still haven't talked about it nothing bad i did hannity last night and the uh we were talking about  the the tweet the leah dunham tweet uh about memorial day and i stuck up for her and said i  didn't think it was anything anti-veteran what did she say just something about hey happy memorial day 
[03:06:00]  i peed in two starbucks bathrooms already like she was just putting two thoughts together and being  silly she didn't mean there was nothing disrespectful about veterans nothing and so uh hannity wasn't that  committed to the idea that there was but the woman i was kind of debating with was uh in dc on a monitor  and she was saying that it was very disrespectful and blah blah blah so we just kind of got into it it  wasn't really nasty i was a little dismissive and irritated because she stepped on me but i liked  her so afterwards this this pukey conservative tv lawyer gets on and goes he was the rudest guest 
[03:06:30]  who was ever on hannity about me just to get her to like him and then i saw that his profile thing  he said i'm the rock and roll commentator absolute douche rock and roll so i smashed him and uh called  him a white knight they were there's a white knight he's trying to stick up for hey right  maybe we could get together and have lunch because she and i sent each other dms like hey it was fun  going back and forth with you and she was like yeah you too it was really friendly yeah she was  great yeah and then throws you under the bus and no she didn't it was just this guy stepping in trying 
[03:07:00]  to get her to go hey thanks a lot okay yeah he did and unfortunately for him his profile pic on twitter  was him and his lovely little daughter and the fans are just fucking yeah they kind of take what you give  them oh they are brutal i'll if i if someone really bugs me and i have enough time on my hands  on twitter oh i go at him i will fucking do such research i mean sit there and paw into google and  oh really and put his name in and try to find an email and find like uh his stash of pictures on 
[03:07:30]  fucking photo sites you can find all that oh yeah you have to and all you gotta do is find a  pictures like kodak photo yes and like you'll fucking see like his wife and stuff and if it  i'll be like oh nice fucking pig wife you got there oh yeah i'll be fucking brutal ruthless your kid's  cross-eyed hey your kid's cross-eyed why don't you fix that lazy oh oh jeez that's the way to handle it  though because you could always just block them i've had more people when you can just i've had more 
[03:08:00]  people cancel their fucking twitter accounts after giving me shit no no shit i have a  fucking great record of people just and the fans are stoked of like well there's another one down  and they just cancel they fucking leave twitter oh man yeah it's great fuck them i don't think she  wants to hear this no i don't know it's a difference of um attack i will go at them and say like really  what what in your day made you so angry that you felt like lashing out at me was going to make it  better stupid and how do you respond to that and then they're like and most of the time they don't 
[03:08:30]  know what to say back sometimes people are like you know what and they actually will be honest  they'll be like i had a bad day i'm really sorry and i took it out on you and i'm like no problem  pretty girl maybe they'll do that oh good yeah but sometimes you're big redhead you  that's so funny um prick but though some guy smacked beyonce in the butt here's the thing  during a concert i have everything out there oh yeah that's so because what the 
[03:09:00]  fuck you know he smacked her in the butt that's hilarious though who does that i know no but you  know something if you're walking around with your fucking i don't know i'm just saying i'm not going  to come off like i'm more i don't agree with touching anybody wait if you're really showing  off your butt if you're you should expect a slap right no no that's what i'm saying if your whole  fucking thing is you know you're advertising your new album where you're singing and you're on you  know you're laying on your stomach putting your butt in the fucking air it's like come on no 
[03:09:30]  i'm not saying i'm not saying it's right right i'm saying what but you shouldn't be  it's like walking through central park at three in the morning dressed like liberaci singing i'm in the  money now you shouldn't get fucking mugged but after a while it's like what are you doing that's  right you go on a date with her she's got a skirt on hey what does she have to say no you know when  you go to a you don't want to just go up and grab the woman up on stage just because she's stripping 
[03:10:00]  you can't do that you can't do that there are rules you guys are confusing me advocating what that  guy did it's just like you can't fucking walk down a goddamn runway where there's people that  fucking close you're giving you're giving people too much credit is what you're doing yeah  they're animals bill is being realistic they're animals yeah the animals he's not saying it's  right i'm not saying it's right he really isn't saying it's right but it's just like whoever the  fucking moron was that goes here's a good idea get closer to these fucking people yeah yeah i'm sure 
[03:10:30]  nothing bad gonna happen i mean god that the people that they're animals yeah you're just gonna grab it's  terrible i had a guy i was um in france i was at the can film festival and i was like on a power  walk with my friend and this guy's coming at us on his bicycle and he literally reaches out grabs  my boobs and keeps biking and i'm like wow what the hell just happened and so i started chasing after  i was so mad but i couldn't keep up i would kill could you just think of this guy laying in bed

[03:14:30]  and slid his hand like it felt like it took an hour but it was so quick though and then he squeezed  my other fucking shoulder and i was just like what is that that's intrusive i was so fucking young i  didn't i didn't know how to react to anything with just pure rage so it's just like well i want to take  his head now and stick it through the fucking vending machine but i'll lose my job i can't  right so then i didn't say anything so you then you felt like you would hoard yourself out so then i just  gave him like dirty looks and then it came time for my fucking raise and it's just bill's very unsocial it's

[03:18:30]  they want to suck my dick i'm just like oh my god is it weird if i want to suck your dick does that make  me gay i have to put a fake voice on when i call wait so got heterosexual guys will call up and say  is it weird i mean what's a gay guy gonna do with me touch my tits like they don't  you could have sex with them right what a gay guy yeah i think they're adorable they just won't

[03:19:30]  so jimmy can start his show so bailey j is up thanks for having me on guys thanks for coming by  anytime yeah we'll see you next time all my violations yeah i'm serious i'll have more next  anthony has left the building the building but jim norton is not going anywhere if you have  problems at a phone it's your lucky day the jim norton show is next  jim norton is a moderately successful comedian an average author and a terrible actor and your 
[03:20:00]  chance to speak directly with him has arrived call 866-969-1969 the phone lines are open and the  jim norton show starts now  ah yes how funny we had jeffrey tamber we interviewed him that's the ropers theme song 
[03:20:30]  of course bailey j is my uh co-host today hi and i don't know if you recognize that music but there was  a sitcom no the ropers right oh you do remember yeah yeah it was it didn't exactly go syndicated  but i've seen like one or two episodes yeah i think that's all there were and uh jeffrey tamber  was the neighbor so we interviewed him and intro'd him with that music and he did not recognize  he's like what's that from i don't know you idiot the show you were on so uh yeah bailey and  i are here i'm saying that bailey i think that she and i should uh should should tape this because  i i have fun doing this with you i agree um i think my appeal is kind of visual anyway makes sense 
[03:21:00]  no but listening to you very good just auditory as well my nasally voice but do you give good  advice and uh i think that we should do something together i agree i couldn't agree more i got  nothing and nothing else going on so no neither do i believe me i every day i look in the mirror  and i'm like you abject failure would you just make something happen so hopefully the phone lines will  light up but i can't see that first one iraq what is he saying maybe bailey can read it because i have  bad eyes uh ask jim how he stayed motivated throughout the year that's what i read oh 
[03:21:30]  goodness oh good this will be all right put them through he's on to me hi mister how you doing good  how are you good i saw you at the stress factory saturday great job thank you um yeah i was just  wondering how you stayed motivated throughout the years you know doing stand-up what made you keep  going i'm sure you had some bad times that's probably made you think about saying fuck it okay yeah kind  of like what we were just joking about about like uh what motivates me to work is the fear  that i am a failure and it's like totally it's an irrational thing but do you look in the mirror 
[03:22:00]  and think like wow i'm doing great in life or do you think like i am fucking utterly devoid of value  you know when i when i first started doing porn i i always made the joke that like i could get into  it if i was like kind of like but if there was a mirror in the room and i had a chance to go oh god  like what what have i become like that moment like i i i don't say i think everyone has that  fear of like i better do this or i'm gonna be a waitress again or i better do this or i'm gonna have  to do that you know i used to work at chick-fil-a and what i do now is a lot less degrading so i'm 
[03:22:30]  just like oh god as long as i'm not back at chick-fil-a i'm happy like i'll i'll take a dick but it is  this uh believe me i think i should be saying the same thing it's the fear is that like but that's what  motivates me sir and thank you very much for the call it's a good question because i think  most of us are motivated by a similar fear like i am i'm nothing i've achieved nothing and if i  i have to i keep feeling like i have to do something and you know how you know it's not rational right 
[03:23:00]  it doesn't matter it's like that voice in your head isn't rational but it's very loud anxiety is  tricky i've learned that from having anxiety anxiety is very convincing do you like watching your  like will you watch your movies and go like wow i look really good there or do you find flaw in most of  them you know what i have moments where i most of the time i'm like oh god they got me from a  profile shot i don't like my nose or oh i don't like this or oh you know because all the girls have  three nose jobs and bleach blonde hair i'm kind of like vaguely ethnic and you know what i mean so  it's like i i i'd kind of like attack that stuff but then there's times where i'm like oh 
[03:23:30]  shit i look really skinny or my tits look fucking huge right or or whatever the thing is um or you  know someone will come on my face and i'll be like damn i have a good fucking face you know i have  these moments but but for the most part it's it's me just like attacking the shit out of myself like  oh stretch mark oh weird thing or why is my stomach doing that you know what i mean it's it's like  anybody yeah you start to feel like i got to do something uh better iraq who do we have on i  just read me a couple of them i usually cannot see all right um wife and i are getting ready to hire  first trenny wants to know what to look for penis that's jerry in utah all right let's go to jerry and 
[03:24:00]  then after that we'll talk to johnny as a quick sabbath question but yes let's that's a very good  question i think bailey can help field this one jerry you're on hi yeah my wife and i are gonna  play mad on craig's list we're gonna pick out a tranny to be with um i'm wondering what to put  on there because we keep getting crossdressers and everything else and we want we want a bailey i  think most transsexuals are that you're going to find that are that hot and what you want are going 
[03:24:30]  to be uh pay for play i think it's gonna be really hard go on erosguide.com and just look  yeah definitely you get what you pay for and that's with anything i i the a lot of the prettier  girls um are really expensive escorts and girls like me are too pretty to escort so i i just i  know i never got into escorting but you're gonna you're gonna if you're on craigslist you're gonna  have to take what you can get and it's probably gonna be crossdressers and crunchy looking girls  who aren't quite there because they're only you to pay for a boob job right so you know they're just not 
[03:25:00]  there yet someone looks like bubba smith in a blonde wig fucking still like the fucking the  raised fucking like you know tattoo from college yeah it's it's not uh you're not gonna find  anything unless you pay for it nothing like it's sincerely passable probably but you could there's  sometimes there are cute crossdressers out there you know so yeah and give me what was that uh one  you said to go to uh erosguide.com where do you live uh by salt lake utah of course okay yeah there's  something you yeah it is uh you could find them utah i'm sure but erosguide.com or backpage.com and 
[03:25:30]  you could find them okay we'll do good luck my friend what is uh john in north carolina wants to  ask about black sabbath um he wants to know what your take is about black sabbath removing bill ward off  the website um hi buddy uh well like like you i mean i'm a sabbath freak as you know and um from  what i understand that i've asked uh i haven't asked bill but i've asked ozzy tony and geezer  bill wanted to be taken off the website because of the problems they have uh it was bill's lawyers 
[03:26:00]  who contacted sabbath and said take bill's image off the site really yeah that that kind of surprises  me all the history it's almost like he's wiped out of the history yeah no no they they would not wipe  him out no no no that was it bills i think bill's very unhappy with the way things went down  and um and again i asked uh ozzy and geezer about this last week and uh geezer said we didn't even  know he was having contract problems until it became public like they're all dealing with lawyers and 
[03:26:30]  there's you know it's on that level they just do it very differently but i'm very sad that it fell  apart like that but you know look i still love ozzy geezer and tony and bill hey i'm a big fan like  yourself one other quick question if you don't mind have you heard the entire album yeah i have  it uh and i'm actually interviewing tony tomorrow on isdn and i have the new sabbath it's called 13  comes out june 11th and i i swear to you it's fucking i'm obsessed with it i absolutely love it  what's that i'm buying it on vinyl i can't wait all right enjoy it buddy it's great 
[03:27:00]  okay who else we got iraq um this guy's brother is addicted to gambling and needs help approaching him  okay what's what's what's luke who has a smoking fetish luke is in myrtle beach smoking fetish  have you heard of it yes i have luke i know all about smoking fetish yeah you're a smoker right  i quit okay luke hey hey jimmy uh yeah i just have always had kind of an attraction for a hot woman  while she's smoking i mean during uh you know a blow job or even during intercourse i'm just wondering 
[03:27:30]  am i alone on this or is there anyone else out there you've heard of that has this i don't  understand it but it's common right it's so common i actually okay while i have never escorted when i  was very young when i was 18 i was paid 500 to smoke in this guy's garage for him while i took pictures  and um and and from that and i as a smoker the pictures always popped up of me like candid photos  of me smoking and people i got a lot of requests to do smoking videos um did your mom smoke not to get 
[03:28:00]  heavy on you um yeah i guess so in all my hands back then because of the era you know okay yeah  i mean i i think it's just my impression is that people just get an idea of femininity or something  that's really it also seems like wrong and you have to admit if you see a girl that you think is  cute and then you see her light up you're like oh wait she fucks like you can just tell as soon as  she smokes it's like this girl makes bad decisions she'll probably want to suck my horrible dick  like i always thought maybe it was the bad girl thing and because i started noticing it in school 
[03:28:30]  even i get that i get that we have it's incredibly common i'd say it's up there with foot fetish maybe  not quite as much as foot fetish and they usually go hand in hand or hand in foot i was going to say  that too do you think feet like because a feet like there's something about when you're you noticed  mommy's toes or you or you see something and you get that little stirring in your pants and you  associate these weird things like the toes or the cigarette with that little weird tent you got  in your pants and it's usually probably the mommy or an aunt or something yeah or or like people you 
[03:29:00]  saw as a child i would feel like i have a foot fetish for guys feet though like i get off on guys feet  but i also have a memory of being like an eight-year-old and some boy holding me down on the  ground and putting his feet in my face and so i feel like oh those two things are probably have a lot  to do with each other do you want them to smell good or bad bad not horrible you like a stink i like  that on a girl stinky foot a little bit yeah like shower sex is the grossest thing i could think of  because then the guy doesn't smell like balls and feet like i i want to smell sex i don't want to  smell shampoo like right that's gross it's weird i've been in i've been to strip clubs and you know 
[03:29:30]  like the girl will be smoking at the bar we'll go back to have a lap dance until her to bring her  cigarettes and it's like they won't throw me out oh wow you know what it's not as weird as people  would like you to think go on um clips for sale.com and look up smoking i can't tell you how many girls  that think they're too good to do porn are willing to do smoking videos so you get their  girls are actually hotter because they don't have to do anything too bad you know what i mean  all right all right thank you good luck brother all right who's the brother guy with the gambling  problem or his brother has a gambling problem yeah that's mike in ohio hi mike how you doing jimmy 
[03:30:00]  good how are you well my brother is addicted to gambling and pills he's always been kind of a pothead  but i know to me that's fine whatever but uh last time i saw him i didn't even recognize him  uh his eyes were like sunken black rings i asked him how his job was going he was up for a promotion  did you get it he just lashed out at me like don't you worry about what i'm doing in my life and i got  my straight and everything else and i'm like bro i'm just asking you if you got your promotion you know 
[03:30:30]  and then my dad tells me he's been selling pills on the side and started popping them and got addicted  to those so and he's going up to the casino like every weekend one we might win some money one week  he loses everything he owes me a couple grand he owes my dad a couple grand but then i see like he's  like on instagram and facebook with a brand new gucci watch with black diamonds in it that he paid five 
[03:31:00]  grand for and it's like so he's just basically like like barely just said about the the mother smoking  he makes bad decisions and and he's he's just kind of he's on a self-destructive path like he'll buy  the watch he'll waste the money um i guess an intervention is the only thing i can suggest because  you can't make him stop right right and that's what i was wondering about is i don't know how to  approach him because my whole life i've been his big brother and i approach him in that big brother  father figure type of way and it doesn't connect with him and he uh is in the urban scene i'm more of a 
[03:31:30]  country boy so he looks at me like a white boy and you know like how old are you i'm sorry to  interrupt you how old are you and how old is he he's 25 okay i grew up in the country when i went  into the service my dad divorced my mom and moved to the city so he grew up in a city atmosphere so  like we are like day and night we well hold on but could you let me ask you a question could you  say to him what you just said to us like hey look i know that i'm i'm older than you and we have 
[03:32:00]  these differences and like when i talk to you i come off sounding like dad and i'm not trying to  do that is there a way to acknowledge that up front and just sit with him and have a conversation  where you're not judging him and you're not saying hey you're fucked up and you need to and  you shouldn't but you're saying look i'm a little concerned about you for this and this way at least  you open the door to him coming to you when he's ready well it can start off that way but then he'll  make some sort of remark or uh cursing at me or something and then my temper gets going and then 
[03:32:30]  i revert back to that you know like i i don't think i've ever seen him as a man well yeah he's  ever comes through when you're talking to him absolutely you know what i mean like it can that  even if you don't mean to it's going to come through when you're talking to him i would think  so it's it's i i think you're gonna have to try really hard not to be a reactionary person i which is  hard but if his tone pisses you off or strikes a chord with your ego and you want to you know 
[03:33:00]  you're right and you want to lash out and hurt him back you have to be the bigger person and as  much as that sucks a big fat dick but no you're right because you have to realize that your motive  for doing this is to help him right and what you're dealing with when he's lashing out and  addiction defends itself people who are addicted violently defend the addiction well no i'm not  it's fine fuck you that's what we do so understand that that's what you're dealing with and that's  who you're talking to and don't allow him to push your buttons and don't push his you're trying to 
[03:33:30]  help him you're not trying to beat him or win right but if like the last time i spoke with him he said  that he had it under control and that not to worry about it he's probably wrong yeah i think you're  right he's fine what there's nothing i can do like you can only lead a horse to the water but  you can't make it drink yes but you can make him thirsty as they say you can make him thirsty  did you ever think of writing him an email or a well thought out letter that you can reread a few  times where you talk about how you really feel and this way he can read it without yelling yeah well 
[03:34:00]  you know i i try to get a hold of him but the only way to get a hold of him is for me to literally  drive to his place to work and call him if i ever try to message him on facebook or email him or text  him he deletes it automatically he doesn't read it he doesn't get back to me uh it's like literally  if there's a family emergency i have to drive 40 minutes north to detroit just to go see him at his  place well maybe maybe you should stop maybe you should stop driving 40 minutes north well like if 
[03:34:30]  he won't respond to facebook things about family emergencies um maybe then you should stop coddling  him and driving to him and feeding into his addiction and being a codependent player in it  uh you know what i mean because if he's really being that much of an asshole um you know i wouldn't  chase him to the four corners of the earth either right right right  i would suggest writing the letter or writing a facebook and then if he deletes it that's beyond 
[03:35:00]  your control it's not your in in the end it's not your responsibility even if you feel like maybe it  is and i'm not saying don't help him but like there's certain people who when they won't help  themselves and they just they just can't it's it's you're like giving up your life for someone who  obviously doesn't care about theirs well right the thing is it's like uh a few times he got himself  into some hairy situations and there was a few individuals threatening his life and that's the  only time i get a call from him right right if some people are here at my apartment they're 
[03:35:30]  threatening to kill me come save me you know and like what am i supposed to say you got your  situation i want to see you on the news yeah no no i i it's very tough when it's family dude it's  very tough to know the right thing myself in that situation i have a wife and a son now sure and now  i'm like okay i'm gonna put my life in danger for my brother and then should i go up there and defend  my brother and then trace these guys off and then possibly get shot yeah of course not of course not 
[03:36:00]  without a husband and a father yeah but like he doesn't see it that way and he only comes to me  when he wants to borrow my car of course or he needs me to say dude we don't we understand you're  right you don't need to convince us right we got thank you and thank you for the call thank you for  that we got to cut you because we got a bunch more people but thank you for the call i would just  suggest if you can't do an intervention then write a very thoughtful email sometimes what do they say  detach with an axe um it's you know you can only offer you can't make him do it and if it's gonna 
[03:36:30]  come there and get you shot you got to avoid that obviously right right now someone's saying i gave  bad advice to someone so let's uh i don't believe it this is joey in milwaukee okay hi joey hey how  you doing jim i'm good what advice did i give that was bad it was probably unintentional um yeah uh  no i just want to reiterate because it sounded good at the time the guy was he was in the military for  like 14 years he was 34 years old and he wanted to get into radio all right and when i when i was  thinking about it later on i was like wait a minute this guy's got six years left in the military if 
[03:37:00]  he stuck it out he could retire with a pension and full medical for the rest of his life to be able  to have a safety net to fall okay sure all right you told him yeah god uh if you want to follow your  dream as somebody in the radio wait a minute but i'm sorry to interrupt you didn't i  say to him too when i found out he had kids you have to weigh the option with are you going to be  able to provide for your kids i remember something about that and saying that you have to weigh the 
[03:37:30]  option and see what it is uh i i do i remember that very well that call um okay maybe maybe you said  that but what i would have what i would have wanted to rather hear was hey how about you stick it out for  another six years you'll you'll be 40 when you get out you'll have a full pension and medical for the  rest of your life all right my father my father retired in 1967 he's had a full pension and medical  and he's still alive today all right well i mean 40 48 years later 46 years later he's still collected 
[03:38:00]  from the military i mean if you get into uh uh if you want to friggin uh be an intern and uh at a radio  show and it would help for that guy to have his pension and medical so that he doesn't have to  worry about a paycheck to feed his kids that's all i wanted to say i didn't i didn't uh really probably  didn't pay attention you say in way of the options that's fine you kind of said you you kind of were 
[03:38:30]  like yeah go for your dreams but well you know what it is jerry like sorry again and jerry thank you for  the call i appreciate it um we at times you say go for your dreams because it's what the advice i it's  what i'm qualified to say because it's what i did so i hate to hear people who don't pursue what they  love right but i i don't think i would ever say like hey fuck your kids and who cares if they eat  um you have to weigh options but obviously this guy if you know this jerry he knows it right right no 
[03:39:00]  one blindly takes advice people ask for advice but the odds of someone's actually going to take the  advice is something completely different yeah they sometimes want you what people when they ask  you for advice sometimes want you to confirm right or refute what they already think they  want your input they're not actually it's not bible for them you know what i mean it's or or  it's not scripture for them it's it's it's yeah even though it should be i mean if you're calling  this program you should absolutely but you're giving bad advice i don't believe it oh i certainly  do i'm always surprised when someone says that it works out like if someone actually calls hey i 
[03:39:30]  called you last week i'm like well i thought everybody shot themselves at the end of the show  so who do you want to take because i can't read that um i can't well i got one from virginia  that's where i'm from maybe that that'll be good or terrible all right let's go with a location uh  call virginia this is alan virginia wants to quit his job not sure what to do here maybe you can  fuck up his life for him yeah let's fuck it up yes al hey jim what's up hi buddy big fan of the show  love your advice show thank you uh so here's my situation about a year and a half ago moved down to 
[03:40:00]  virginia by myself no no family only one friend who offered me a job uh you know looking for greener  pastures looking for a change you know i was tired a while with the situation that i was in  and ever since i've moved down here everything that i didn't want to go right uh went wrong so  everything that i've done has gone wrong i'm at a point where i'm just at my wits end i'm depressed i  hate my job i hate the what what is the job bud did you say i'm sorry if you said i missed it al 
[03:40:30]  yeah it's a overnight overnight uh operations kind of you know as a supervisor at a contracting place  okay so i hate the staff that i work with they're horrible they're ignorant i i feel like i i'm i've  burnt out so many different times already i've made horrible mistakes and i'm at a point where i don't  even know what to do because i feel like if if i if i if i quit if i give up on what i tried doing 
[03:41:00]  over here i feel like i've done a disservice to myself and at the same time you know i have like  i said the friend who hired i had a friend who hired me and i feel like i'm doing a disservice to him  how old are you 24 oh you're a young guy and then you know how many people and i'm not saying you  shouldn't find another job first how many people stay in situations because we're afraid of saying  i made the wrong move right right and right you stay with the job totally but that's but why punish 
[03:41:30]  yourself if you genuinely i'm not saying do one thing or the other you know obviously you could go  either way on it but it's and also because you're 24 it's like your current life circumstance it it  probably feels all-encompassing like this is your reality but it's just your current reality life is  constantly like there's constant transitions in life you know what i mean so it's like i feel like  ultimately whether or not you stay at the job or decide to do it today or tomorrow life changes  regardless like it's what sucks is the depression that's what's really tough is the depression do you  have anxiety oh yeah do you do you have no do you get like random panic attacks yeah yeah i do it's 
[03:42:00]  like sometimes doing the simplest task whether it's at home or work just turns into you know complex  rocket science because yeah decision that i decide to make is the right one but i have so much panic  and so much indecision in me that i end up making the completely retarded well you're because you're  afraid you're going to make the wrong decision and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy like you know what  i mean like at least i'll speak for myself that's exactly how i am where i'm afraid to make a decision 
[03:42:30]  because i the worst thing i can imagine is regretting the decision and and anxiety leads to so much  depression because you use like all that energy being anxious and being worried and your heart's racing  and your hands are sweating that ultimately it's going to turn into depression you know what i mean  your body's going to do the opposite swing where it's just depressed and lethargic and i have the  worst anxiety in the world so that's why i was asking it's it sucks ass but um i wouldn't put too  much pressure on yourself whether making a big decision like do i stay here do i not do i but also  don't stay because you're afraid to admit that you that you want to change paths like don't cut your nose 
[03:43:00]  off to spite your face that doesn't help anybody and we all make a shitty decision sometimes it's life  yeah oh yeah i made tons of shitty decisions i can't tell you how many losers i've blown in my  life i there's one guy i literally call him cool sweater guy to this day like that's because he had  a nice sweater i have no idea what his name was so talk to me about regrets i do tranny porn  so what you do is you look for another job and you get another job fuck letting anybody down and make  if you made a dumb move hey look you're 24 you're not 60 right you just make you just fix it that's all 
[03:43:30]  and there's no person they're actually sitting there waiting to let you know you  fucked up or you did something terrible like no one's judging you like everyone's too busy  worried about their own like crippling anxiety okay yeah you know you guys you guys are right  damn right we are thank you al very much i hate being judged for something negatively i mean i feel  like i'm a person with good intentions and you know at the end of the day i don't want to burn you  know colossal bridges that you know someday i may may need them or may not need you right if you find 
[03:44:00]  yourself asking yourself if you're a good person then the answer is yes because assholes don't think about  that right you know i usually try to follow a path not perfection but you know the good path and  sometimes you know i just end up killing myself over it right all right i'll thank you very much for the  call buddy and good luck to you and uh you know again we all switch jobs sometimes it's okay you're  not a failure because you switch a job um anthony and callie i can't when i fuck my girl from behind  and that's all i can read and i'm dying to know what it says you can move your mouse over it it'll expand 
[03:44:30]  the comments oh i get so scared iraq i just don't want to fail now it's small letters again  what's that say when i fuck my girlfriend from behind my girlfriend is losing her breasts oh breath  not her breasts okay let's talk to a big dick in california anthony hey hey what's going on jim hey  hey uh no it's not i don't think it's a big dick issue i have a fucking normal dick i just it's for  i think it may be the position she's in but either way it's fucking ruins it every time like  well i'm fucking her when we're done is this when we're done it's almost as if she's holding her 
[03:45:00]  breath i've asked her that but she says that she's hot but then she just gets short of breath  it's like she starts coughing like erratically and fucking the other night she got like into tears  it just fucking horrified me it's like ruining i love ass and then that's just fucking up that's  like my favorite position and now i feel like it's kind of being ruined i don't want to go to a doctor or  wait so is it anal sex or just doggy style no it's just doggy what the fuck i've never heard of  that no me neither that's what i don't understand do you think and this is maybe if dr steve is 
[03:45:30]  listening i i don't this is a medical question but i wonder could it be a psychological thing  where she's panicking that her pussy or ass stinks or whatever it is she's having a panic thing and  maybe that's what you're what you're dealing with i don't know i mean we've never had the issue  we've been here five years i mean i still eat her pussy and it doesn't it doesn't smell or i mean  have you asked her about that why she reacts that way yeah no i mean i just asked the other night 
[03:46:00]  even when it happened again came over again this is probably this has been going on for like the  past year and a half and she just said she doesn't know she just feels like she's losing her breath like  her breasts get way shorter and i have her head down in your ass is that like maybe the blood's rushing  in your head or i don't know she said she just says that she thinks yeah she she feels like her  head is there's all kinds of blood in it and she starts coughing like crazy i mean can't can you you  say you like ass i mean is there a way to kind of incorporate her ass and then just like bang her 
[03:46:30]  another way you know what i mean like maybe eat her ass for 30 minutes first yeah of course i mean and  that's the thing she doesn't do that if she's on her back if she's on her back and just like miss  there even sideways or any of that shit or or i mean even if she goes down on me she doesn't it  doesn't happen that way but if for some reason it's one she gets that doggy style position then  she immediately starts i talked to a doctor because we have a doctor on the phone dr steve is on i'm  gonna ask i'm gonna say one psychological thing too what i was she ever assaulted or like that it all 
[03:47:00]  goes back to being molested but do you think anything ever happened to her in that position that  that brings back i mean not that i know of and i've never really brought that up i mean that's a  good that's a good point dr steve hello are you here dr steve he he's in the middle of something  he's trying to find a place to call back in oh okay okay all right well just listen in on the response  and uh okay thank you very much for the call wait till dr steve thank you jay okay buddy uh bailey do 
[03:47:30]  you see one that you like um i'm gonna go over any of them um i can see them from here let's see  erica do into spanking oh let's talk to who's that tom in toronto i think it's doug in boston  oh is that doug in boston yeah sorry yeah hey guys hi uh jimmy i love your show man you found a  new calling buddy thank you one of my favorite things to listen to that's right i like to consider  it saving lives go right ahead actually a couple of things one um well first of all the reason i 
[03:48:00]  called was because you guys were talking about the smoking thing and uh i'm a big spanko and have  been forever and uh there's a great site that's called uh spanking glamour unfortunately the guy is  so i'm also a video professional i mean i work in the industry and um you know most spanking videos are  kind of uh less than stellar this guy really gets it down he's uh great lighting gorgeous girls you know 
[03:48:30]  he has them you know has say different things it's really cool but he also does a site called uh  smoking glamour and he does the same thing where but it's all the girls are smoking and then occasionally  he will combine the girls who are smoking while they're getting spanked and you know the smoking  thing has never done anything for me but uh it's uh this was for the guy who called before if he's into  smoking i strongly suggest the uh smoking glamour that's awesome it sounds perfect i you know what 
[03:49:00]  i'm i'm a sucker for those websites that actually have really good lighting and like they're you  don't mean like you can actually see the girl as opposed to other ones where they try to hide the  girl at all costs yeah i know this guy is great and he actually uh he you know he's got a face camera  because a lot of us who are into the spanking thing you like to watch the expressions and the whole  thing oh okay you know he gets them to say you know oh i'm so bad and spank me and i'm so sorry and  you know every once in a while you get one who really looks like there's some tears involved i'm  not really sure what that kink is but that really does it for me as well so uh yeah yeah huge um 
[03:49:30]  that's awesome thank you very much buddy no wait jimmy one other thing i gotta tell you um you hooked  me up with uh erotic review oh yeah the erotic review is very good yes yeah oh my god and i'm 51 years  old and have never been with a hooker or an escort or anything and my wife is kind of uh not into the  issue when we first got married she was into my kink and then of course we have kids and so on and so 
[03:50:00]  forth that goes very sad but so finally i couldn't take it anymore and i found this great girl and uh on  the erotic review and it was just an awesome experience the only issue i have is that it's really expensive  it is in a lot of ways and uh you know again you don't want to be blowing your fucking  your family's vacation money i'm single so for me it's a little bit different um but hey it is fun  isn't it oh my god we had such a great time and it was hours and hours well actually it was probably 
[03:50:30]  a little over two hours closer to three but it's still like six hundred dollars i mean  shit man that's a lot of money yeah all right brother thank you for the call very much  thank you and uh doctor let's talk to dr steve real quick about this oh yes also the guy called  back who had the question that we wanted to refer to dr steve so you want them both oh just just steve  for now and then if he needs a guy we'll bring him back on hello dr steve hey man you're talking to uh  to me and and the the delightful bailey jay hi hey bailey how are you oh i'm good 
[03:51:00]  did you hear where our call was no no oh sorry i was on rounds and i was i'm in the middle of the  hospital and sal calls me and says oh jim wants to talk to you about someone who's short of breath  when they're doing it on all fours and it's like i'm running from room to room  where i can actually talk about this in the hospital without uh oh okay incurring some sort of uh 
[03:51:30]  hostile work environment complaint all right let's talk to anthony california let's get him on he can  explain to you dr steve when he fucks his girl doggy style uh she gets like a shortness of breath  okay okay um so anthony i do could that could there be a physical reason for that absolutely  oh okay absolutely what would it be oh okay well i thought you're gonna put him on uh if she has  a little bit of what we call truncal obesity which means that she's got a little extra fat  in the uh lower abdomen region when she bends over and if she especially if she's thrusting 
[03:52:00]  backward that fat is going to push up on her diaphragm and it's going to keep it from uh uh  fully uh contracting and she will have difficulty breathing and it's the same kind of thing that you  have i don't when you were overweight jim you may have noticed when you bent over and tied your shoes  even just for a second you would feel this shortness of breath and it's the same it's just  say it dr steve when i pushed back against the young lady that i was paying 
[03:52:30]  that's a truncal obesity how do you bring that up well i know what a great twitter name hey uh anthony  does your girl have truncal truncal obesity that's what i'm aware of she she has a little bit of a tummy  but she only weighs 125 pounds she's probably i mean she's five six yeah okay that's i mean she's  not fat by any means but yeah yeah she does have a little bit of a belly that i know that i mean  she's still she works out every day but she tried to get rid of that little bit of beer belly that she 
[03:53:00]  has it's very tiny but she has it yeah well and it doesn't take a lot it's um i'm close to my ideal  body weight and i still have that problem when i'm bent over tying my shoes so uh you know i'll just  you'll feel this sudden onset of shortness of breath that is relieved as soon as you change  position now if she has it in any other circumstances shortness of breath when she lies down or shortness  of breath when she's prone or anything like that then obviously she needs to get checked out by her 
[03:53:30]  doctor the thing i would i would suggest is uh get one of those uh what's that pillow thing  the liberator or something what is that jim do you remember the name of that thing you guys had it  in the studio at one point the liberator yeah try using a liberator and that way she can lean forward  on that thing and uh take the pressure off of her diaphragm and or uh just see if uh using a  different position doggy style uh where she's not hunched back on her legs where she's actually sitting up 
[03:54:00]  uh on all fours if that makes a difference and then let me know email me weird  medicine xm at gmail.com and we can walk through this weird medicine xm at gmail.com thank you  dr steve very much oh anytime and thanks anthony see that's what you know when sometimes it's just  you know me i go right for the molestation should we get in the ass by an uncle and then of course  there's you know trying to trunkal obesity steve is so smart all right so tom and uh trunkal obesity 
[03:54:30]  is the fucking term of the century tom in toronto has something about vegas tom hey how's it going  thanks for coming to toronto back in the fall oh you're welcome buddy thank you hey a co-worker  went to toronto right and i he he gave me to clean his truck while he's gone and then i found it it  almost appeared like a freaking suicide note what's it saying it says i must go now the torment and  loneliness have become unbearable i have come to realize i will be alone until i die no one cares  anyway well that's a suicide note yeah i will be forgotten in six months i gave up myself about 10 years 
[03:55:00]  ago and i cannot take another year of it i am beyond help like you're supposed to be home like  a like next week right and it's like i you know but what uh what do i say let me ask you now where  these where did you find the note it was in his truck where on the truck well just in like he was  paying me to clean the cleanest truck you know the outside the inside all that stuff and i was going  through his papers like sorting shit out there and i come across this it's like what the do you think  he wanted that found that sounds almost like he left it there to be found well i don't know 
[03:55:30]  it's i mean guys are good at having you not find things they don't want you to find you don't  accidentally find someone's butt plug like ever like guys hide the guys guys are good at hiding  that shit i don't know that that's and then he went to vegas so is he in vegas now yeah he's there with  him he's there with one of his friends or he went for like two weeks or whatever right so i don't know  they just had a bad day one day and freaking got fed up or whatever and just you know well you should  obviously ask him about it because you weren't in it's not like you searched through his diary he paid  you to clean his right right right yeah so i just wondered what jim norton would do i would ask him 
[03:56:00]  about it i would say look man not to be nosy but yeah i'm cleaning this out and i see this so of  course i read it and i'm sorry if i shouldn't have but what's this about i mean uh and then maybe he'll  talk to you maybe he'll say it was nothing but uh he might be reaching out in his own weird way  right right well i mean if you don't say something and then he inevitably if he did commit suicide  then you'd have you know what i mean you'd kind of have that on your on your conscience yeah you'd feel like a  silly goose i guess that's that's one way to put it all right all right thanks a lot okay thank you 
[03:56:30]  very much uh no to that one what do you what do you think bailey how about uh fucked a girl i didn't  know when i feel guilty i'm really good with guilt okay james in kentucky by that i mean i have it  hey hey yeah uh this uh what's up jimmy first of all hi buddy uh i don't know it's like most like  90 percent of girls i've ever slept with i was actually in a relationship and then uh yesterday  i mean it was during the day it was legitimately just a hookup or booty call whatever you want to 
[03:57:00]  call it even talking through the social media and uh it wasn't bad and she liked it but i just really  feel really fucking guilty like as soon as i left i just felt like this weighed on me why  i have no idea that's why i've gone you it could be a couple things it's either a you are religious  or you feel like you know i should be in or not religious i just feel like i should be in a  relationship or do you know that she wants more than you're going to give her like sometimes when 
[03:57:30]  somebody won't say like hey look i'm looking for love right now or i'm looking to be cared for  we pretend we don't notice that and we fuck them and then sometimes the guilty feelings come because  we know that we capitalized on their loneliness right well a lot very few girls are in it for  the cum on their stomach you know what i mean like they they want a boyfriend so well literally  literally it was kind of the opposite like it was pre-established that i was going to show up  we were going to fuck and then i was going to leave and then you know hey i'll let you know the next 
[03:58:00]  time we need to fuck or whatever well maybe maybe then maybe you feel used or maybe you just like to be  in a relationship yeah i wouldn't kill yourself with guilt that's the thing were you are you like a  recovering catholic like me no no well because i was raised catholic and so now as a result i have  like looping anxiety and guilt and i replay things i did 20 years ago that were fucked up and then i'm  like oh why did i do that what's wrong with me and i just sit there until i'm about to throw up and  then um because keep in mind i also the first half of my life i had a very male mind about sex and then 
[03:58:30]  now the world puts female pressure on me about sex so i have the memories of being a horny disgusting  you know what i mean like being allowed to fuck like that and then now being like oh god why did i blow  those losers or why did i do this or why and i looped this anxiety so can you uh stop the thought  well i i don't know it's like i enjoyed the liberation of you know not having to worry about  you know what are we going to do or how am i going to get into this right that shit's already laid out  it's just i don't understand why there's there's guilt theoretically i mean it's like the perfect situation 
[03:59:00]  for most guys oh yeah hey you know i fucked this yeah you can't have to buy her dinner but i don't  know well like as al pacino said and uh and thank you very much for the call as al pacino said in us  in uh the devil's advocate you got guilt's like a bag of bricks you just got to put it down  uh this is a question for bailey i think uh adrian in toronto uh bailey's much more qualified for this one  actually jim i thought i would rather have your feedback on this you mentioned that okay  on the show that you didn't really like breast implants oh i think you were gonna i think i 
[03:59:30]  actually thought you were a woman named adrian who was getting them that's why i really did  no no okay i want to get them i wanted to get them for my wife you know we had a few kids  uh but you know she's a little cautious and i'm trying to talk her into it but uh you know it's not  my body so i can't really right really force it so what i don't want to force it what is your  question though like what are you not sure of the results you you said on the show that you  know nine out of ten implants were were horrendous i mean that's true yeah there's a lot of them are 
[04:00:00]  not good i personally like real breasts but if the option is implants or no tits or implants are  awful tits you got to go with implants right well i have implants right and and i was very particular  about how they did my implants because i've seen a lot of fucked up implants and uh usually girls i  think girls tend to want to go under the muscle you have the option of going under or over the muscle  and the girls that go under the muscle end up with these fucking like bolt on like they're all 
[04:00:30]  spacey they just look like fucked up pecs like they just look fucked up uh mine are over the muscle and  as you can see they move and they jiggle and they they feel like tits like they function like breasts  right um it's all about it basically what you want to do is look at the before and after pictures of  the doctor and don't look at like what the breasts look like necessarily look at the symmetry  see how symmetrical the breasts look because that means that the doctor is really good at putting in  parallel pockets for the implant some guys or some doctors put the pockets like too far in the armpit  and then these girls have tits in their armpits they look fucking ridiculous or they have room for a 
[04:01:00]  third tit in the middle so it's yeah you want to um go to my doctor in las vegas um dr arthur cambero at  the surgery center look up my tits and then i know i know i'm a dude but i got nice fucking tits so look at  my tits and then take her there it was like eight grand and my tits are like the best thing that ever  happened to me and adrian i i would say uh as far as pushing her you don't want to push her into doing  something like that because that could build up a lot of resentment in her like fuck him if he doesn't 
[04:01:30]  like me how i am um no no jim no i love my wife we had we had a we had a bunch of kids and and you know  she she breastfed so we're not i'm not thinking of going something large just you know nice sea or  something just to fix him up a little bit yeah just that's what i was thinking about but i i  really it stuck in my mind when you made that comment that uh you know you haven't seen many  good ones yeah i've seen a lot of bad ones but like i think bailey answered it with um go to that's  what i wouldn't know what to look for in a doctor and we have to let you go because we have to end the 
[04:02:00]  show so i apologize to jeff uh john brian and rick who we didn't get to and anybody else but that's  what you should do go go and look at the symmetry i would not have thought to uh to do that  otherwise you know we're cockeyed tits it's fucked up there's nothing worse lots of girls have them  my boobs are completely symmetrical i'm very happy about that </pre>
