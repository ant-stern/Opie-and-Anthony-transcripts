<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with a self-congratulatory introduction, positioning themselves as "radio shock jocks," before launching into a bizarre segment about a masked individual ("Mask Boy") and a fight involving "Rowan" and "Dave." This transitions into a promotion for "Whip Them Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners to display a "WOW" symbol to garner female attention.  The show then shifts to a discussion of Andrew Morton's unauthorized Tom Cruise biography, focusing on rumors about Cruise's sexuality, Scientology, and speculation about the paternity of his child.  They announce Morton as the next day's guest.

A substantial portion of the broadcast is devoted to a review of *Cloverfield*, following an advance screening attended by Opie, Anthony, E-Rock, Jimmy, Patrice, Thin, and Danny. Opie details his severe motion sickness from the shaky camera work, comparing it to *The Blair Witch Project*.  The discussion covers the plot, filming techniques, and reactions from those at the screening, along with upcoming interviews with J.J. Abrams and the cast.

The show then dedicates a lengthy segment to a news story about a construction worker who, after head injuries requiring stitches, underwent a forced rectal exam at the hospital.  The hosts dissect the worker's lawsuit, listener calls offering varying explanations for the procedure (potentially checking for internal bleeding or spinal damage), the patient's right to refuse treatment, and the overall absurdity of the situation.  The discussion is filled with jokes, vulgar language, and speculation about the doctors' motives, interspersed with personal anecdotes of unpleasant medical experiences from the hosts.

A later segment delves into a discussion of the "sexiest candidate," referencing Hillary, Mildred, Ethel, and Gertrude, punctuated by listener calls. One caller recounts a bizarre rectal exam at age 13 with his mother present. The hosts then discuss a 911 tiger attack call from the San Francisco Zoo, highlighting the operator's repeated pleas for the caller to remain calm.  Anthony Cumia's blackjack strategy is debated, leading to a comedic skit and a call with Ben Mezrich, author of *Bringing Down the House*. A physician's assistant calls to challenge the plausibility of the rectal exam story.  The show features a segment mocking the campaign trail songs of various presidential candidates (Mitt Romney, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, Bill Richardson, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama).  This is followed by man-on-the-street interviews highlighting illogical voter reasoning, and a return to the discussion of Anthony's blackjack strategy with Ben Mezrich.

Another segment begins with Opie recounting a frustrating card game experience.  A brief mention of Ben Mezrich's book (which recently sold movie rights) precedes a pre-recorded audio clip of Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The hosts offer sarcastic commentary on Cruise's statements, covering Scientology's practices, beliefs (including thetans), and secretive nature.  Excerpts from Morton's book are read, detailing allegations of controlling contracts and rumors of Katie Holmes carrying a child to be a vessel for L. Ron Hubbard's spirit. A self-identified Scientology employee calls in.  This is interspersed with "FU Line" calls and listener calls, including one about accidentally groping a father-in-law and another about personal Scientology encounters.  A call with Larry the Cable Guy features a story about being rear-ended, and discussions of his career and opinions on celebrities. The segment concludes with discussion of a potentially fraudulent story and Larry's closing remarks.

A significant portion features Jim Norton discussing relationship problems with his girlfriend, highlighting their stubbornness, his demanding work schedule, and her feeling neglected.  He expresses frustration and acknowledges his girlfriend's understanding nature and their past issues. The conversation touches on the difficulties of maintaining intimacy with an erratic work schedule.  This transitions to a discussion of a viral video of a 16-year-old, "Corey," who threw a massive party.  Initially believing they have Corey on the phone, they play a humorous interview where he refuses to remove his glasses.  It's later revealed to be a prank, with the pranksters detailing their hoax and its success.  The segment includes prank calls impersonating Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa, Elvis Presley, and Osama bin Laden, and a discussion of UFO sightings in Texas. Sam Roberts is present in the studio during part of this segment.

The final segment features a rambling discussion about the vastness of space and the insignificance of humanity, using crude analogies.  A listener named Steve is chosen for a "punishment" of having Jim fart in his face, which he vehemently refuses.  The "Line of the Day" segment features humorous listener submissions, including "She blinded me with cankles" and the winning line, "And that's how you executive produce."  The show promotes "Couples Cherry Darts," a contest with a $2500 prize from BodogLife.net.  The overall tone remains irreverent, vulgar, and comedic, characterized by crude humor and non-sequiturs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happens to your socks?  I don't know what happens.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Yes, mask boy.  His skin is completely black.  Oh my god.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my god.  Oh, Rowan's got a paddle.  Oh my god.  Rowan's on him.  Rowan is kicking Dave's ass. 
[00:01:00]  Who saw this?  They are sick.  Freaks.  One, two, three.  Dump.  V-Rock is attempting.  Give us a thumbs up if you're alright.  Shut up!  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning everybody.  What do we got, a little whip them out Wednesday happening? 
[00:01:30]  Uh, yeah.  Of course we do.  It's wow.  That will never go away.  No.  Never!  It's just such a great, great promotion.  Wonderful people adore it.  One lousy wow logo and all hell breaks loose.  At concerts, sporting events, beach parties.  Yah!  On the roadways.  Display your wow.  Be proud.  Be proud.  Be proud.  The wow stands for whip them out Wednesday, 
[00:02:00]  and there are women out there that will flash you if they see the wow.  That's all you need is a little wow on your vehicle somehow.  A sticker that's written in the dirt on the back of a truck.  Anything.  And you drive around and all of a sudden you go,  Oh, hey, why is she flashing me?  Oh yeah, that's right.  Thank you, Opie.  And then you have to go,  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Even though we're not sitting next to you,  but just say it.  Out loud.  Yeah.  Like a lunatic.  Because the thetans will get the message to us.  Oh, are you getting into Scientology? 
[00:02:30]  Thinking about it, thinking about it.  Are you thinking about getting into that whole thing?  I just have to say thetans correctly.  The thetans.  The thetans.  The thetans.  We meet that guy tomorrow, right?  Yeah, we're talking to, what's his name?  Andrew Morton.  Morton!  Yeah.  Who wrote the biography?  Andrew Morton.  The unauthorized biography of Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  Coming on the show.  I was skimming through that book.  He's not brave enough to deal with that homosexuality rumor thing. 
[00:03:00]  No.  No.  He's leaving that one alone.  He left that alone?  According to Andrew Morton, Tom Cruise is a heterosexual male.  All man, huh?  All man.  Yeah.  He knows it's a good way to drain your money is to call him a homosexual.  But he does tackle the whole Scientology thing and the thetans and the rumor that Tom Cruise's  baby is actually somehow associated with Ron L. Hubbard. 
[00:03:30]  Ron Hubbard.  That would be his Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma Sperma.  And that actually he had his kid to keep the whole God thing going.  You gotta, you know, keep that whole line going, I guess.  And then in the paper today, they're saying that he's just completely nuts, Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  Just losing his freaking mind, so.  Yeah, there's a video of him or something where he's talking about Scientology.  Scientology.  Yeah, I think we got the audio.  We're gonna play it a little later today. 
[00:04:00]  Turns off like a real lunatic.  Absolutely.  Why did I hear that he had hired like a gay, a porn star.  Really?  To help him with the book.  Like, and they said that, and again, this is, I don't know where I even heard this.  It could have just been something on the stupid net I read.  Well, according to the Cliff Notes.  Oh.  Read the Cliff Notes.  Like the Cliff Notes.  He doesn't tackle the subject at all, really.  Nah.  Maybe he really is straight.  I mean, maybe that's just this dumb rumor that got started.  And it's not worth, there's nothing to tackle.  Right.  So we'll ask him tomorrow.  I mean, he's coming on the show. 
[00:04:30]  He's a, he's a, he's a big writer.  He's a big one.  This guy.  Big time.  He's written some big, uh, some big autobiographies.  So, uh, we got that going on.  Also, we might've been pwned.  We'll explain that a little later.  We're trying to get to the bottom of it.  Damn.  But we might've got pwned.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I guess we should start by talking about Cloverfield.  Don't worry, we're not gonna give anything away.  But we, uh, we were lucky enough to see one of the first screenings of this movie that's  getting a lot of buzz.  It's got that viral marketing all over the internet and stuff. 
[00:05:00]  And, uh, they did a screening for the radio show.  And I don't know, 10 or 12 of us went.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I'm in a tough position, I gotta tell ya.  A doggy?  No.  Oh.  Why would you be in a doggy position?  I don't know.  Why would that be tough?  That would be tough for a guy.  Why would I be in a doggy position?  I don't get it.  Uh, just tough position.  That's a tough position.  All right.  It's a position joke.  That fell flat. 
[00:05:30]  Very flat.  I don't know.  Let me see.  No LOLs?  Yeah.  Well.  So, uh...  Oh.  This is the position I'm in, though.  I, uh...  Doggy?  Now it's fine.  All right.  I got, uh...  I'm, uh...  I got nauseous, uh, watching the movie.  Like, motion sickness.  Nauseous.  Like, I almost had to leave the movie to go puke. 
[00:06:00]  Nauseous.  And, uh...  And then I was telling Anthony, like, in the office, that I had to kinda choose when to  open my eyes to watch the movie, because the movie was really cool.  It was very different.  Right.  They did something very different in this movie.  The whole movie's based on, uh, camcorder footage, basically.  Something happens in New York City, and this, uh, you know, this guy is filming the whole  thing.  So it's shaky cam a little bit, huh?  Extremely shaky cam.  Oh, boy. 
[00:06:30]  They wanted it to be as real as possible.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, the cameras turn it on and off, you know, so you're seeing scenes, and  then it goes off, and then it pops on to the next scene.  Very jumpy camera work, very shaky camera work, because they're in a complete panic  because of what's going on in New York City, so you're not gonna have a nice, steady cam,  right?  The camera's steady whenever they're in a panic, or see a UFO, or a Bigfoot.  So, I, uh, I think I was the only one in this crew that got motion sickness really bad.  It was like Blair Witch Project camera movement.  Oh. 
[00:07:00]  And that, I couldn't watch Blair Witch Project for the same freaking reason.  A lot of people couldn't, yep.  Well, the, the same thing is gonna happen with this movie.  It didn't affect Jimmy, it didn't affect any of the other guys for the most part.  I was so, uh, nauseous, I had to close my freaking eyes, and I was pissed, because I really  wanted to watch the movie.  Like, during the movie, you're sitting there at the movies with your eyes shut.  Well, and then choosing, like I was telling you, I'm like, okay, alright, alright, the  guy's bloody, and he's having a conversation, it's a lonely action, alright, I can keep my  eyes closed, keep your eyes closed, okay, monsters are back, alright, open my eyes! 
[00:07:30]  Or whatever, I'm just saying monsters, I'm really not gonna try to, yeah, whatever it  is.  So I had to choose when to open my eyes, because I really wanted to check out the whole  movie.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, besides that, the movie was, you know, really good.  It was really good.  Yeah?  It was really good.  It wasn't this, it wasn't a typical Hollywood movie.  Right.  Which I like.  I get motion sick.  Like, I have bad ones, but it didn't affect me the same way, like...  You sat in the back, and I was thinking afterwards, I'm like, I should have sat back with Jimmy, 
[00:08:00]  and maybe that would have helped me.  Yeah, I didn't get me that way, but it was very shaky, but I really liked it.  Um, I, I, it was, I never saw Blair Witch, so they said it was kind of like that in a  sense, but alright, so it was one of the movies that did that, but I thought it was  really good, man.  Patrice hated it, though.  It was like, it was like...  Patrice hates everything.  Yeah, because it was white people having fun, that's why he didn't like it.  Yeah.  He hates everything.  And, and...  And he was making fun of the, uh, you know, the, the battery of the, of the camcorder,  because, you know, you're, because the movie takes place over, what, eight, nine hours, 
[00:08:30]  and Jimmy figured it out, like, no, the camera wasn't on eight or nine hours, the camera was  on the amount of time...  It was on on the screen.  On the screen.  Yeah.  Which was, which was a mere hour and a half hour and 40 minutes.  That makes sense.  You could do that.  Yeah.  Patrice is making camcorder battery jokes during the movie.  It'd be like, how, how long is this battery gonna last and stuff?  Which was really funny at the time, but then when we were walking home, Jimmy nailed it.  He's like, no, that, you know... 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it was turned off, and then it would come back on.  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  So...  No one films for 11 straight hours, like, in a, in a...  I'll, I'll tell you this one type of a concept.  There's one scene where they're, like, in the village, and they have to get to, say,  Columbus Circle.  Mm-hmm.  And on film, it takes a few minutes.  And because it's doing, like, on a video camera thing, you watch it, and you're like,  ah, there's no way they'd make it that fast.  Right.  But then you're like, oh, yeah, they turned the camera off.  Right, yeah.  No one would film the entire walk.  No.  Because...  What you're seeing is what they shot.  Because you're used to watching a movie, you know what I mean? 
[00:09:30]  Like, if they're gonna go to Columbus Circle, you pretty much see the whole, you know,  the whole, like, tour, or the whole trip, the whole trip to Columbus Circle.  Mm-hmm.  But that's not the case in this thing.  This stayed pretty true.  It was really well done.  They must have cheated a little bit here and there with the camera, but, I mean, they  did a really good job, man, of making it look like it was a videotape that was shot.  Mm-hmm.  You know it's a real Hollywood camera, because the audio's too clear.  It could be a video.  Yeah, right? 
[00:10:00]  And the effects would be too expensive for just a bunch of idiots.  Yeah.  There was a movie reviewer in there seeing it for the first time, Jeffrey Lyons, here  in New York City.  Oh, really?  Who just looked like a pompous ass.  He was getting up to take popcorn dumps, I'm convinced.  A popcorn dump?  He enjoys his popcorn, that guy.  And at the end of the movie, Patrice, because he just wants to be obnoxious, he just goes,  Boo!  And Jeffrey Lyons goes, No one asked ya!  Oh!  He goes, Half a star! 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, Patrice goes, Boo!  Half a star!  And Lyons goes, No one asked ya!  Yeah.  I'm pissed off.  I don't know what's the matter with you.  I didn't expect Patrice to...  Patrice doesn't like anything.  I don't know what Patrice likes.  We've been around him for a long time.  I have no idea what he actually likes.  He makes fun of everything.  300.  He liked that.  Yeah, he did like 300.  He liked to get down to it.  Yeah.  So, E-Rock, what did you think of the movie?  I loved it.  E-Rock loved it, too.  Yeah, it was great. 
[00:11:00]  You didn't get the motion sickness thing?  No, not at all.  See, I'm a wimp when it comes to that crap.  It's so annoying.  And I used to commute on a train and watch movies and read books and newspapers.  It never bothered me.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I'm glad you thought so, because I thought I was the only one that liked it.  Patrice didn't...  No, I liked it, Jimmy.  Patrice hated it.  You liked it.  Yeah, I just couldn't get...  You know, the motion sickness thing was just, you know...  Bob Kelly didn't like it.  But again, Bob Kelly is kind of easily led.  Bob's a slow boy. 
[00:11:30]  And he's closer to Patrice.  Bob needs a polished Hollywood movie with a definite beginning and a definite Hollywood  ending.  As well as a polished hollow point bullet.  Yeah.  Now, obviously, without saying anything about the ending, were you satisfied when the credits  started rolling that you had seen a movie?  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's just say not traditional, though.  Okay.  Not a traditional wrap-up in the sense that we're used to.  Uh-huh.  That's all I'll say.  That movie's gonna do really, really well.  Yeah, I like it. 
[00:12:00]  What, it comes out Friday?  Yeah.  It comes out Friday and we're having the director on what?  Tomorrow?  Calling in.  I think J.J. Abrams is calling in.  I think tomorrow he'll talk about the movie with us.  The cast, I know, we're actually interviewing five members of the cast.  They're coming in?  I believe they are, yeah.  Hmm.  Right, Thin?  Yes.  Good.  You liked the movie too, Thin?  Yeah, it gave me a little bit of a headache.  Oh, so you got a little of the motion sickness too, right?  I feel like an old person, but yeah.  You got a headache.  I was just like make it stop for a couple times, but yeah.  Aside from the effects though, which, okay, that's something that's gonna happen to people 
[00:12:30]  because it's just the nature of that type of film.  I was just thinking like, I get it, it's gonna be shaky camera work because you're in  the middle of this, you know, horrific thing that's happening in New York, but why couldn't  they make it less shaky and still get the point across that they're, you know what I mean?  Filming during a crazy situation.  I was watching certain scenes, let's just say there's a scene on the Brooklyn Bridge  where bad things happen.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  And there's panic.  And I'm like, that's what it would look like to be videotaping a scene like that is  what you would do. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And they always found a way, even during certain moments which were, let's just say  where you wouldn't be standing there holding a video camera in real life, to get what you  needed to see on video and yet not really compromise the scene too much.  Like, they had to cheat a teeny bit because it's a movie.  Yeah.  But they didn't have to cheat as much as you'd think they would have to make it happen and  make it look like, yeah, this could have been shot.  Like, it was just, I loved it.  I really did.  People are asking, did they show the monster?  Yes, they did.  Yeah, you have to tell them that.  They did show the monster.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  I just felt like a wimp, man.  I had to go home and lay down after the movie because I was so freaking sick.  I don't want to admit that, but I have to.  Did you like it though, Thane, or did you hate it?  No, I really liked it.  That's good.  You know.  Yeah.  I like a little more, a little more concrete answers for some of my questions would have  been good.  Okay.  But that's it.  How about Danny and Danny saw it with us and Butcher, we could ask over the next  time, but did Danny like it or where is he? 
[00:14:00]  He's cutting up audio.  Okay, did he like it or you don't know?  Yeah, I think he liked it.  I think for the most part, everyone enjoyed the film, you know?  Mm-hmm.  So, it's tough to talk about because you don't want to give too much away.  All right.  You want to make sure the people out there that go see Cloverfield starting Friday?  You know.  Friday, last of the night.  Get the experience we just had.  Did you like it, Danny?  Yeah, I did.  I liked it too.  You know, there was a lot of hype leading up to it.  And, you know, I think going in, you kind of have to understand that, you know, you  probably have this overblown sense of this movie in your head. 
[00:14:30]  So, you kind of just have to be like, all right, it's just, it's a film.  I'm going to watch it and I'm going to enjoy it.  And that's exactly what you do.  It's just a, you know, it's a great popcorn flick.  You sit there and you enjoy it.  No motion sickness?  Nah.  I'm a wimp.  I am a wimp.  Dude, and I'm bad.  I get really bad motion sickness.  Like, really bad.  Well, you know what it is too.  Like, you know, doing morning radio, you desperately needed like, you know, crash for a little while  after this show.  And when you have to stay up to do something, like, we get the type of tired that's like 
[00:15:00]  kind of a nauseous tired to begin with.  It's not like a normal tired.  So, on top of that and then seeing like shaky camera work, the combination was just,  was too much for me.  And if you were too close.  Yeah.  It might have been too close.  I should have moved back.  Your peripherals kind of help you out if you're farther away, you know.  I should have moved back maybe.  That would have helped.  You need to have the walls in your, in your, right.  Yeah.  Perif as I call it.  Perif.  You don't have the walls in your peripheral and it looks like it's moving.  You're finished.  And then A-Rock told me cause we left right after the credits, they had a little something. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  There's a little something at the end.  Is it worth staying around for?  If I understood what it meant, probably.  Oh no.  Okay.  All right, dummy.  Oh no.  I didn't understand the first part.  I didn't understand the first part.  I didn't get it.  This slow boy had to see it.  Aw.  No, it's just hard to hear.  Hold on one second.  This is like the village idiot who saw something and is running into one of the other villagers.  Nobody knows what he's talking about.  Yeah.  What happened, Lassie?  Can you tell us? 
[00:16:00]  Aw, damn it.  Had to be A-Rock that saw it.  I saw it.  Yeah, no one else stayed.  Everyone left as soon as the crime came out.  Oh, yeah.  He was raiding popcorn like bags like a little kid gets drinks at the parents' party when  they leave.  I'm sorry, Rock.  I actually need information from you in here.  Why did you like the movie so much without giving it away?  I liked it for a lot of the stuff that like the camera would move right if something important  was going to happen.  So you only caught, in certain parts, you only caught a tiny glimpse of it. 
[00:16:30]  So it's what you didn't see and what you heard that actually made it better than actually  seeing some of the things.  Yeah, I thought that one thing they could have done at certain points, I would like  to have a couple of questions answered better, which I thought they could have.  But in a way, that in a way is what I like about it, is that there's certain questions  like they could have squeezed in an answer here and there, but that's not the way it would  have been taped.  Like the way it was shot, eh, that's probably the way it would have been shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyone that carries around a camera and just shoots stuff here and there, that's what 
[00:17:00]  this movie was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And nobody would have had the answers the day of.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  Like, that's one thing I liked about it.  Oh, I don't know.  Let's just not fight.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Cloverfield.  It starts Friday.  We're going to be interviewing the director tomorrow and some of the actors in the coming  days.  Steve from Bayshore is saying that E-Rock liked it right up to the time the concession stand  ran out of garlic butter saw. 
[00:17:30]  Do me.  Do me.  Do me right here.  Do me right here.  And we got a...  Okay.  We got JJ.  All right.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Just getting started today.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  O-N-A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Call the Opie and Anthony show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Opie and PDA users send your message to feedback at opiananthony.com.  Didn't need to give him a rectal exam after a piece of wood clocked him on the forehead. 
[00:18:00]  What?  What?  Why?  And, you know, it reminds me of the story where I went in for strep throat to my doctor's  office.  Next thing I know, I'm getting that type of exam.  Yeah.  For what?  For what is right.  This poor guy goes in for eight stitches and he ends up in jail, said his lawyer.  He had the right to say no.  Doctors sedated the guy and then did the rectal exam. 
[00:18:30]  Did the exam.  So here's a guy, construction worker, gets hit in the head, needs stitches.  He goes in and for some reason, maybe we'll get to that, they decide he needs a rectal  exam.  The guy's like, no effing way.  He's a macho Brooklyn construction worker.  He's like, no!  Yeah, his quote's fantastic.  Yeah, we're getting that.  So the hospital sedates the guy and does the exam anyway.  A Manhattan judge denied the hospital's bid to have this guy's malpractice suit against  the hospital tossed. 
[00:19:00]  We're looking forward to our day in court.  This guy, 38, was working at a midtown construction site in May 2003.  Wow, this is how long it takes to get this stuff going.  When a plank slammed him in the head, knocking him down.  Medical records state that the construction worker was alert and oriented times three when  he was taken to the hospital's emergency room where a resident informed him he needed  a rectal examination.  You got a sound effect for that there, E-Rock? 
[00:19:30]  Rectal examination.  They want more sounds on the show.  So I want you to come up with something, all right?  So the guy gets hit in the head with a plank.  Yeah.  And he goes to the hospital.  They say, we have to give you a rectal exam.  Yeah.  Do we?  Yeah.  Was the rectal exam, was there something wrong with it or was it just part of the procedure?  I can't imagine if you're hit on the head and you need stitches that you need a rectal  exam.  Unless the plank went completely through your body.  Yeah.  Then maybe.  Then maybe.  Or something. 
[00:20:00]  But I don't see any reason for it.  Right.  Well, it continues.  This is the construction worker now, and I don't think he used Heck, by the way, but  this is, I think they're cleaning it up for the paper.  Who in the heck is the doctor to force a medical procedure on you if you're conscious?  The revelation.  Oh, that was the lawyer.  That's why the heck.  The revelation about the rectal exam set off this construction worker who smacked a doctor  during a struggle and yelled, where I came from, you don't put anything in someone's. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  That was his quote.  Where I came from, you don't put anything in someone's blank.  Yeah.  Where did it come from?  My girlfriends?  Wow.  I was trying to say that she doesn't enjoy certain activities.  I understand.  There's no way to word it.  I know.  We have a quote from him in the hospital.  All right.  And we got a little audio after the exam. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, this age set up great.  I like turtles.  Yeah, whatever.  Timing's everything.  The outburst led to the construction worker being sedated and arrested through the matter  was later dismissed, though the matter was later dismissed.  A spokesman for the hospital described this guy sued as completely without merit.  We intend to vigorously contest it. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, but they don't explain why the rectal exam for getting hit on the head with a plank.  Let's hear from the doctor.  All right.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes, scroll, scroll.  Yeah, they don't say any like you would think the doctor would say, well, we did this  procedure because, you know, give us a little insight as to why they did this procedure.  Right.  But nothing.  They're keeping their yaps shut, I guess, until it goes to court and they could figure out 
[00:22:00]  they could all concoct some reason that they had to give this poor guy a rectal exam.  Well, we got Travis on it.  He's going to try to find more info, so we'll see.  I need to know now why the rectal exam.  Why?  Well, do they think that it was done by a guy who inappropriately wanted to just touch  him or do they think that maybe he was checking for internal bleeding?  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  It doesn't make sense.  There's other ways to do that, I think.  Okay.  I went in for strep throat and the doctor's like, I noticed you haven't been here in 
[00:22:30]  a while.  Pull your pants down.  Yeah.  What?  Hey, you ain't been here for a while.  Here's your greeting.  I came here for a Z-Pak for strep throat.  What's going on here, doc?  And now because of him, I don't go to the doctor anymore.  See?  I have to find a new doctor.  Scared you off with a digit.  Boy, did he.  Creep me out.  One digit.  This guy's going to explain the rectal exam.  Oh, okay.  Matt in New York.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:23:00]  Hey.  Yeah, listen.  If it came in as a trauma activation, which it might have, what they do is they do the  rectal exam just to look for that internal bleeding.  Okay.  And it's not a pleasant procedure.  You know, the doctors don't want to do it.  It's not like guys are lining up wanting to do this stuff.  Yeah, you got to defend the doctor to a point.  I don't think there's many doctors out there that look forward to doing that.  What?  Is it done, sir, like...  What?  I lost my thought.  I'm sorry.  Aw, Jimmy. 
[00:23:30]  Meaning, is it done, like, in the same way, like, you know how you go, you get your prostate  checked by a doctor to do your health?  Yeah.  No, it's a quick in and out.  And what they do is they do a stool guac.  What they do is after they take their finger out, they dip it on a card and they put a little  reagent on it and it returns fluid.  That's what they do at the doctor's office also.  Right.  All right.  Yeah, they do it because they dip stuff for cancer screening.  All right, I understand all that, Matt, but the problem is the guy came in for obvious  stitches to the head.  We all...  You're not going to get cancer from getting it on the head with a plank.  We... 
[00:24:00]  Almost all of us have gotten stitches to the head.  Yeah.  You go in and none of us have been told that they need to do a rectal exam.  No.  I mean, would I personally do a rectal on this guy?  No, but, I mean, you might have interns and stuff that they're looking to learn, too,  and, you know...  Learn.  You're going to choose a Brooklyn construction worker?  Yeah.  As a test subject?  Are you crazy?  He smacked one of the doctors before he said, you know...  It wouldn't be me, but, you know, there are some weirdos out there also.  Yeah.  We need to know more because the story doesn't really explain... 
[00:24:30]  Maybe another paper has more details.  I don't know.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Why you do this thing?  Why?  Oh, it's an epidemic, though.  We got Scott in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Scott.  I had a buddy who fell out of a tree hunting.  Mm-hmm.  And from the fall, they had to do a rectal exam.  Now, I'm just curious, maybe from the jar of getting hit in the head, you know, they  have to check to make sure everything's still intact.  Well, Gary, who lives here in New York, he says that 1010 Wins, the news station, reporting 
[00:25:00]  the hospital said the rectal exam was necessary to check for spinal damage.  How about an x-ray?  Right.  You know?  Sonogram, something.  How about you just touch around a little bit and, does this hurt?  Does this hurt?  Does this hurt?  Yeah.  It hurts.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no...  Yeah, there's no saying that doesn't hurt.  Right.  Just touch his back, you're gonna get an owl.  You can get an owl by just poking around the spine, though, too. 
[00:25:30]  You know what?  That construction worker's a dope, though.  Because what he's saying is not...  His objection was, where I come from, you don't...  Really?  Stupid?  Yes.  He's all man, Jimmy.  What he is, he's a dummy who will die like John Wayne did, with 40 pounds of food in  his colon, with his eye, he doesn't know what he's talking about.  But Jimmy, that's what real men do, they don't go to the doctors.  That's right.  And they don't get rectal exams when they just need stitches.  You think the Duke...  It's just the way of a... 
[00:26:00]  That's just the way they are.  The Duke is gonna stand there in a doctor's office and go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  as he's getting the old digit?  No.  I submit to you, no.  Duh-huh, da-huh.  Oh, God.  Duh-huh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  That's awful.  Duh-huh, da-huh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  All right, we got a nurse.  She's going to explain. 
[00:26:30]  Duh-huh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's not the nurse.  Hi, nurse.  Hi there, good morning, guys.  First time, long time.  Hi.  Actually, the recto exam is done on patients who have head injuries.  It's part of a neuro exam to see if you have sphincter tone.  If your neurostatus is intact, you'll clamp, quite frankly.  Oh.  You'll what?  You'll clamp around the face.  That makes more sense.  Wait, I didn't hear her because I'm reading. 
[00:27:00]  We found more details on the story.  But go ahead.  What?  Hold on, Lisa.  It's getting explained.  Well, she's saying if you have some type of head injury, a certain type of head injury,  you can tell by the, I guess, the sphincter will react in a certain way if it's normal.  And if you have a certain type of brain damage, it won't.  Correct.  It won't.  So what are you saying?  Because the natural instinct is when that's happening to kind of clench off and stop it from happening. 
[00:27:30]  It just seems like if you have a certain injury, are you saying that your body won't clamp up?  It will just kind of stay relaxed?  Correct.  If somebody has head injuries and they're brain dead, for example, they'll have no reaction to that or a gag reflex, actually.  Wow.  Okay.  Right.  Start whapping your women on the head.  That's right.  If you have to do those tests, gag reflex first.  That's the order you're going. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  There you go.  Well, let's say hi to Jim in Buffalo.  Jim?  Hey, how you doing?  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Call Shred and Reagan today and say hi to them for us, all right?  What do you got, Jim?  Will do.  Will do.  Last August, I got hit by a car and I had, I couldn't remember some of what happened, so  they put me to a trauma patient and I had no idea what was coming, but they were actually  checking down my spine and then it was just, I was violated.  It was violated. 
[00:28:30]  You feel violated.  I got everyone beat, though.  Falling out of a tree, car accident, rectal exam, strep throat, rectal exam.  Beat that one.  Yeah.  Beat that one.  There's no reason for that.  None.  There are people actually making sense out of a head injury and having to get a rectal exam,  but strep throat, no.  I knew there was something drastically wrong with what happened in that doctor's office  because I went home and I took the rape shower.  Did you?  Yeah.  I felt all just, ugh, used. 
[00:29:00]  The washcloth just going, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, and squishy.  Felt used and squishy.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jim.  Yep, have a good one.  A lot of people calling the construction worker an idiot.  I don't see it that way.  The guy didn't want, he didn't want his exam.  You gotta, you gotta, I think you gotta respect his wishes.  Yeah.  Maybe explain, you know, that this is really important, but if you don't want it, all right,  well.  Maybe they didn't explain to him why they were doing it.  Like, look, here's the story. 
[00:29:30]  We gotta do this to test for this or something.  If somebody just comes at you with the gloves on.  Right.  You know, you're gonna put up a little bit of a fight.  Well, the lawyer's talking a little more.  We found more info.  So the lawyer says, uh, emergency room staffers insisted, insisted on examining his, uh, you  know what, and held him down while he begged, please don't do that.  I feel bad for this guy. 
[00:30:00]  He just didn't want this.  But meanwhile, though, if they didn't check and there was something wrong, that dummy would  be the first one online to call a lawyer and suing the hospital for malpractice because  they didn't give him the proper exam and check for, for, for brain injuries the right way.  Look, there's a, there's a ton of guys out there, including us.  We don't want this done.  So the, what the freaking, uh, hospital should have is the form sitting there waiting.  All right.  As long as you sign this, I don't care.  Yeah.  There should be a stack in every room.  There should be just a stack of that form. 
[00:30:30]  So it's like, no, okay, sign this.  It waves any, uh, responsibility from us and, um, you go home.  As far as guys go, and maybe we could get a list together today.  This is a tough one.  You know, we're all supposed to get that, uh, exam.  It's a tough one for guys.  Yeah.  That is a tough one.  They always save it for last in the, uh, doctor's office when you go for your, uh, yearly medical  exam.  Oh, it's the stairway to heaven.  That's get out your lighters, the encore, get out your lighters, the encore, here comes 
[00:31:00]  the encore, you know, there's no more songs after that.  No, thank you.  Good night.  Right.  Well, when it comes to living as a guy, that's, that's just a tough one.  I understand it's a necessary and it could, it could, it could help you out in the long  run if you get everything checked out early, but it's tough.  Yeah.  It's a toughie.  Yeah.  You feel a little weird leaving the, uh, going back to your car and driving home.  Mm-hmm.  You don't, you don't feel quite the same.  A lot, a lot of guys have, uh, have died because they didn't want to do it. 
[00:31:30]  There are a Frank Zappa.  There's a lot of guys that would rather die than get that.  Rather die than have someone check that out.  I have no doubt in my mind.  You're absolutely right.  All right.  So I say one thing though, like fine if he's dying, but when you're in a hospital for trauma,  it's different because you're going there saying I have a trauma.  It's almost like, what if he didn't like stitches and they go to put stitches in his head?  Are they supposed to, are they supposed to acknowledge that this idiot, which is what  he is, an idiot, doesn't want that dumb because he's a homophobe or doesn't like that sensation? 
[00:32:00]  Well, perhaps they didn't explain it to him.  Maybe not.  Okay.  But, uh, something tells me, yeah, this guy, even if they did explain it to him, he wasn't  going to go for it.  The way he's don't, what did he say?  Please.  Yeah.  He, what's the quote?  Please don't do that.  And there's a doctor.  Not even phased.  Please don't do that.  This is what your doctor hears as he's going into the examination room to give you the rectal 
[00:32:30]  exam.  He's just all about it.  And that consent form would be no good because with a head injury, you can't ask somebody  to sign up.  Oh, boy.  I was just going for him.  I was going for silly, Jimmy.  But no, not accurate.  Hey, uh, construction worker continued.  He said, uh, oh no, the lawyer continues here.  He said that Prasad is his name, I guess, hit a doctor while flailing around and Stafford's gave him an injection, which knocked him out, which knocked him out. 
[00:33:00]  He's out.  Yeah.  And then they raped him.  No, and then they performed the rectal exam.  Yeah, yeah.  Prasad woke up handcuffed.  Oh.  To a bed.  Oh, my God.  The guy just went in for stitches.  With a ball gag in his mouth. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  And the gimp standing close by.  And with an oxygen tube down his throat.  Wow.  And then he spent three days in a detention center.  Wow.  The lawyer said he and Prasad later learned the rectal exam was one way of determining, here we go, whether he has suffered spinal damage because of the accident.  But as soon as he punches out the doctor, there's nothing wrong with the spine.  All right, we understand this guy's fine.  When you're kicking and flailing and punching out doctors, I think the spine's okay. 
[00:34:00]  I'm no doctor, but.  Now I'm going to be really scared if I get conked on the head and have to go to the hospital.  All right, could you not do that, please?  I'm going to stop off at Home Depot and get some duct tape.  The lawyer said his unmarried client who lives in Brooklyn has not been able to hold a job since the incident.  Yeah.  Wow, this guy, the lawyer, final quote, he goes, he's just not the same psychologically. 
[00:34:30]  I hate this guy.  He felt like they were trying to rape him.  Really?  That's what the lawyer's saying.  Wow.  He'll get some money.  That's pretty fucked up.  No, he won't.  He'll get nothing.  Oh, Jesus.  I hope he just dropped the F-bomb.  Ah, that's pretty.  Ah, anyway.  Screw it up.  Sorry.  He'll get nothing.  You don't think he'll get anything?  Absolutely not.  Everyone gets something when you sue.  He's right.  I mean, I'm sorry, the hospital's right.  He's just being, I don't like that sensation.  They're like, we're checking for a spine injury, you moron. 
[00:35:00]  No, he's got nothing.  Hmm.  Interesting.  We'll keep our finger on the pulse of this story.  Can we get the guy on the phone?  Let's try to get him on, man.  He's crying.  And let's get the real guy on today.  Phillip, no, let's go to Lindsey in Jersey.  Lindsey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  So, I had battalion problems with my feet, just to have flat feet.  So, I went to a podiatrist, and after looking at my feet, looking at my back, he wanted 
[00:35:30]  to do a rectal exam.  Uh-oh.  Wow, that might be.  See, the foot doctor shouldn't be doing that.  There's no reason.  That might be.  I was freaking out.  We all know what his first choice was in medical school.  He didn't quite make it there.  What was the reason he gave?  Well, actually, I didn't really stick around for any kind of reasoning.  He just asked me if I had ever had a rectal, and I had said no, and he asked if I would  object to doing one, and I said yes, and I left. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  Ain't been back.  He must feel like, oh, God.  Oh, she goes to the cops now.  I'm done for.  Look, I know we talk to a lot of doctors, so I'm not talking about all of you, but I  think there's a bunch of doctors out there that are just getting away with murder.  Gotta be.  Getting away with murder.  You see it.  A little peek here.  Nice mark come in.  You're like, oh, okay.  Get to do an unnecessary procedure here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks, Greg.  And then, by the way, if you are a podiatrist, you're into feet. 
[00:36:30]  You're into the foot fetish thing.  Yeah, probably.  There's no way around it.  He wanted to fix your flat feet and get you right up on your toes going, ooh, ooh.  Right.  Right.  Their flat feet are fixed.  That's why I can't go to any of those specialty doctors, because I'm in radio, because I don't  like radio, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh.  I love radio.  Oh.  When you're young and you're trying to figure out what you want to do with your life, you 
[00:37:00]  try to go towards something at first.  There's a lot of people that, unfortunately, are doing jobs they hate, but we all had the  same dream when we were younger to try to do something that we really liked doing.  Yeah.  So, if you're a foot doctor, you love feet.  You gotta.  If you're doing those rectal exams, you love.  You know what?  Gynecologists, are you kidding me? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, please.  Of course.  They love it.  Can't get enough.  And you know what?  Gynecologists love all shapes, kinds.  Is it?  Doesn't matter.  They don't care.  Fatty comes in.  Fatty, old, young, and everything in between.  They love it all.  And the ones that tell you now, man, you know, for every 16-year-old coming in for their first  exam, we gotta deal with the grandmothers.  We've done the break on the show, and they call up these guys. 
[00:38:00]  They love it.  Let's go to Dan in Ohio.  Thank you, Lindsey.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, I gotta go against Jimmy here.  The hospital has no right to violate you if you say no.  I know what you're saying.  Like, and you do have a right to say no.  But when you're in a trauma situation like that, like what they see is you come in for  an injury, and they're treating you for an injury.  Then what happens if they don't treat you, like, especially with a head injury where  you probably can't sign away your rights because you don't have a head injury, what position 
[00:38:30]  are they in?  Okay, do we listen to this guy who thinks he knows what he's talking about, but he doesn't  because he's like, you know, been raised and a man doesn't have that done, and then  risk getting sued for $40 million because he had a spine injury that they couldn't detect?  Yeah, but Jimmy, they've got the form.  All they have to do is have him sign it.  If he can sign it, they've got their...  Once again, bro, once again, you can't sign...  I mean, I think in certain...  Like, they say you can't sign away your rights.  I don't think in a case of a head injury, that's admissible evidence. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but how could you admit that if you're struck in the head?  I don't know if you'll think I'm a lawyer because I point a lot when I talk.  You're representing me.  Well, go to the stream, look at Terry Shiloh.  I mean, she...  They decided for her that she was going to die, and you had all those other people saying  she didn't want.  Well, that's different, sir, because she wasn't able to speak for herself, and she wasn't  in a trauma situation.  There's different...  They were just treating a guy who came in for a head bump.  I mean, if that's one of the procedures they do, and there's a reason that they do it, 
[00:39:30]  it's...  I don't know who's right legally.  Right.  I think...  They've got a reason for everything.  They've got a reason why they probed Opie for a strep throat.  Right, but what happened...  Doesn't make it right.  I'll tell you the difference, though.  Opie was not in for a head injury where he could have come back and sued the hospital  for malpractice because they didn't detect a spine injury because they listened to Dr.  Opie sitting there.  You don't listen to Dr. Construction Worker.  Mine was a little different, too, because it was obvious I haven't had... 
[00:40:00]  I make fun of the whole thing, but it was one of those while you're here type things.  Hey, while you're here, let's get this over with.  Still a little...  What creeped me out was when his lab coat, I've said this many times, he got caught on  the doorknob as he's trying to get out of the office with the finger up in the air  to smear it on a slide, and then I actually had to get up partially nude to let him out  of the examination room because it was his left sleeve was caught on the doorknob, and  he couldn't turn the right side around because that was holding the finger up in the air. 
[00:40:30]  What a predicament.  Oh, it looked like an awful comedy.  Like, he was making a proclamation.  And I will...  Yeah, will you?  And there was no eye contact after that.  It was just all awkward and weird.  Opie, did he get a kiss on the cheek?  Well, that would have been nice.  I wouldn't have had to take the shower because then I would have realized that he actually  cared.  Cool.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Yeah, I just don't think you can sign the form. 
[00:41:00]  And this is not a preventative medicine, like cancer screening.  Yeah.  You know?  I guess this is something they do.  Yeah.  When you have something happen to your head like that, part of the whole emergency room  procedure is you've got to have that rectal exam.  I don't know what the law is.  I guess that's what they're going to figure out.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Lucky in Kansas.  Lucky.  Yeah, I was wondering if a bump on the head gets you a pink shot.  What do a translators get you?  Don't they have a plan B or something? 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  Let's go to Utah.  Tyler.  What's up, Tyler?  Hey, last thing this guy said was, ah, don't finger me, bro.  Come on.  I think it's time to go to break.  Jay in Tennessee.  Jay, save us.  Hey, I just wanted to say, man, I thought this was a lot funnier when I saw it on the  Family Guy. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  You've never seen that episode of Family Guy?  No.  I wouldn't have said really if we had, sir.  No, we did not.  What happened?  It's the exact same thing.  Peter goes in for an exam.  Doctor sticks his finger up his Yoo-Hoo and he sues him.  All right.  So, are you making fun?  I don't know what you're trying to do with your phone call, sir.  Did he get hit in the head and have to go in or did he go in for a checkup?  What happened?  He went in for a checkup.  See, then it's not...  You've got to be getting your lawsuit ideas from the Family Guy. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, the guy?  You're saying the guy?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not making fun of y'all.  I'm making fun of him.  All right.  Of course you're not making fun of y'all.  Yeah.  It's like he's ripping off Family Guy for a lawsuit idea.  If you're going to rip somebody off, just dump some McDonald's coffee in your lap and  go for the big money.  So, you think this might just be a clever rule?  All right, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup, although the phones are just lit right now.  We'll try to get to more of your phone calls after the break. 
[00:43:00]  877-212-O&A.  Finally today, we're going to be playing the Hillary song, I've Got a Crush on Hillary.  Ugh.  Yuck.  And we got the 911 call from the tiger attack out there in San Francisco.  Ooh.  All on the way on Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  Nice. 
[00:43:30]  Rock.  I like this.  Rock!  Damn.  Good morning.  Uh, Diane Keaton cursed it on TV yesterday.  Yeah, I guess they give her a pass, huh?  Will there be an FCC fine?  No.  Radio guy says a curse word, goes through.  He will be fired.  Morning, uh, dopey little news programs.  Big stark curses, it's okay.  How is, um, by the way, how is that not on a delay? 
[00:44:00]  How are they not on a five second delay?  Uh, they're not.  They decided, uh, no delay for that show.  What, Good Morning America?  Yep.  I'm sure now they'll put one in place.  We put a delay on the Today Show back in the day.  Yeah.  We're responsible for that one.  Why, why is it, why is it like a five second delay?  That's not breaking news.  Diane Keaton in her night, in her Woodstock outfit yesterday.  That stupid glasses and her hairdo.  Enough already.  We get it, right?  She's anti-sexy.  We, we get it.  You're Annie Hall. 
[00:44:30]  When she's in movies now and they try to pair her up with like the older gentleman and they're  two sexy older people that are going at it.  It's just not, it doesn't work.  She's, I think she's asexual.  I don't think she goes either way.  Yeah.  There's nothing, uh, sexual about her.  She's just, she's just what she is, but, uh, she cursed yesterday and there'll be no problem  because, you know, different standards for, uh, for, for morning TV.  What'd she say?  The F word.  You know, the F word.  Really? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  It's quick.  Here it is.  All right.  I have to ask you about something.  I mean, I love them.  I'd like to have lips like that.  Then I wouldn't have worked on my personality or my, my, excuse me, my personality.  If I had lips like yours, I'd be better off.  Also a crime.  My life would be better.  I'd be married.  And I'd be thin, little skinny lips.  What am I going to do?  My mother's going to work on your personality with soap in your mouth is what she's going  to do.  Oh, so.  I know.  Excuse me.  We're going to handle it with a phony laugh, you stupid old lady with soft lens on you. 
[00:45:30]  Dumb Diane Sawyer.  Thank you, Tanner Boyle.  Shut up.  It's Tanner.  Come on.  The dopey hairdo.  As far as older women go, she's up there, man.  I wouldn't, I don't know, I've never seen her without a fake lens on her.  Oh, film it through cheesecloth.  Yeah, I like this.  I guess I would like to see her in person to see if she looks the same.  She's going to tape it through drywall.  She's 60.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  She's 60 years old.  So.  All right, well.  Who the hell's that?  In what?  Diane.  Looking for Mr. Goodbar?  Why are we looking at a naked picture of Diane Keaton?  And she's got like a stalker patty box to her.  It looks like the movie, Attacking the Giant Ant.  Something's got to give.  Yeah.  Oh, Nicholson?  That's how she looked?  Because wasn't that scene really quick?  Like you didn't really get to see that?  You only need one frame for Mr. Skin.  Ew.  Yuck.  It's got like an alien body.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Anyway, moving on.  It's something we teased yesterday.  It's just terrific.  Got to love the internet.  Yes.  Hey, I asked for everyone's song yesterday.  Do we have a list of that today?  All the candidates, they all have to have their song.  Who made this popular?  Was it Clinton officially?  Clinton kind of, yeah.  He really made like popular songs.  Don't Stop Believin'.  I mean, not Don't Stop Believin'.  Don't what?  Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.  Yeah, Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. 
[00:47:00]  Fleetwood Mac.  And now every candidate has to have a theme song.  Their song that means something.  It has to, yeah, people have to hear it and go, yeah, I know this song.  And wow, listen to the words.  It kind of means what the candidate's trying to put across.  Do we have that list?  It's all, it's more phoniness.  All right.  We need the list because every candidate that we know, they have a song.  And I think Barack Obama's using some kind of U2 song.  Is he?  We'll get the list of the songs the candidates are using to kind of hype everybody. 
[00:47:30]  I bet you do.  Can't play it here, but it's on Panzerfaust Records.  That's wonderful.  The house.  The house next door to me.  I remember that one.  Ah, yes.  The Toad Tapper, unfortunately.  Trying to download it from iTunes.  They don't seem to have it.  No.  They seem to have every other song.  Yeah, what happened?  Anyway, this kid, kind of doing a, kind of like a Blink-182 thing. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And he's singing about his love for Hillary Clinton.  What kind of crap is that?  Wait, who's Obama?  By the way, he's ripping off Billy Joel in the background.  You'll hear the riff to pretty much, we didn't start the fire.  We didn't start the fire.  It just reworked slightly. 
[00:48:30]  Now, this is the interesting part.  If you, if you, hopefully you know what Obama Girl is all about.  Yeah, yeah.  But they got this really hot chick with just nice boobies to wear really tight T-shirts  and stuff.  And it's all over the internet.  It's a very viral campaign.  Yeah.  And it's promoting Barack Obama. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  And this nerdy kid is basically saying that she sucks.  Yep.  Because he's all for Hillary.  Because he's into mommies.  Obama Girl, you're a skank.  And everybody knows.  Obama's not gonna win.  Even if you take off all your clothes.  Hillary always. 
[00:49:30]  Winning the debate.  I know you're crushing on Obama.  Well, I, I've got a crush on Hillary 2008.  Oh.  It's just that generic crap music.  And then singing about Hillary 08.  And punt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And punt.  And punt.  And punt.  That.  Oh.  God.  That, that's terrible. 
[00:50:00]  I'm sorry.  Yes, it is.  You want to hear more?  I, of course I do.  Mm-hmm.  In 2008, you're the sexiest candidate.  There's no way we're gonna lose.  Barack Obama can't dance like you.  Your ankles are bigger.  Obama.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  You're a good actress. 
[00:50:30]  You're quite a thespian.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have political rules.  But I know that I want you.  Those eyes, those eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I've got a crush on him.  2008.  You're the sexiest candidate. 
[00:51:00]  There's no way we're gonna lose.  I wish I was as cute as you.  Oh, no.  The Iowa's got the show.  Oh, look at that.  What do you know?  New Hampshire for the win.  My mom is a Republican.  Ah, ha, ha.  I get it.  It's cool.  It's almost over. 
[00:51:30]  We can stop it right now.  No, I like it.  Please.  Let's just stop it here, Jimmy.  I want to hear the rest of the lyrics.  No.  Funny.  Awful.  All right.  This goes on, huh?  Cute 182 from Steve from Bayshore.  Cause I've got a crush.  Yeah, I've got a crush.  I'm Hillary.  This song makes me hate America.  I've got a crush on Hillary. 
[00:52:00]  Ugh.  I just got, like, the chills of the douche variety.  That was, that was very believable.  Huh?  Sounds like one of those okay cable bands.  Yeah, exactly.  Trying to sell us a cable package.  Yeah.  Let's go to Scott in Iowa.  Scott.  Hey, love you, love the show.  Wank, wank.  Shouldn't Hillary's song really be  Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto? 
[00:52:30]  Mrs. Roboto.  That would be good.  Should be her song.  Hillary.  Does anybody, and no one really,  like, think about her goddamn name.  Hillary.  Isn't that one of the most unsexy names  you've ever heard also?  I think Hillary's coming back.  No.  Some of the names do come back and get sexy.  She's not.  Hillary.  She's not making it sexy, but.  It's like Mildred.  Yeah, well, Mildred and,  you can't compare Mildred with Hillary. 
[00:53:00]  Ethel.  Hillary's back.  Bula.  Hillary's no Madison, but, you know.  No.  Gertrude's worse.  Hillary can't be coming back.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I don't think Hillary's that bad.  Hillary Duff.  Yes.  That old lady is like,  good, good, Gertrude.  They're bringing it back.  Gertie.  I like a girl named Gertie.  I think there was a time Hillary was  considered a very, like,  old-sounding name,  but they're kind of bringing it back  into, you know,  into the new again.  Cloris and Myrtle. 
[00:53:30]  That's sort of a good one.  What's wrong with Myrtle?  Myrtle.  Let's go to Adam in Queens.  Adam?  Yeah.  Hey, Adam.  Hey, I'm calling to tell my first  Rectal story.  Okay.  No, wait, wait, wait.  I said that wrong.  So I'm 13 years old,  and my mother takes me to the doctor.  Well, how old are you now?  27.  Okay, so back when you were 13, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back when I was 13.  My mom takes me to the doctor, 
[00:54:00]  and there's two doctors in the room,  and it's just a regular checkup,  and they're asking me questions  and things like that.  And, you know, they're like,  you know, we should do a rectal exam.  So the first doctor,  who's much smaller,  comes up, and, you know,  there I am laying on my side  with my mother watching,  and he's poking around,  and he's like,  hey, you got to feel this.  You got to come over here.  The other doctor,  who's twice his size 
[00:54:30]  and has, like, football player hands,  comes over here, you know.  And that's what he has to do, right?  Yeah, I basically felt like I was raped,  and my mom watching.  Oh, and your mom was in the room watching?  Yeah.  Well, what is he asking?  I bet you that was a nice exercise for mom.  She was just studying your face,  going, huh,  we've been wondering about this.  All right, we get to find out right here.  He looks a little pain.  Right here, right now.  So, that's weird to hear a doctor.  No, not a little pain. 
[00:55:00]  I was going with the,  is he cracking a smile?  Oh, kind of digging it?  Because I think every parent out there wonders.  And right there, you know,  the mom got to know for sure.  Yeah.  If this was a one and done,  or sending him down a path of,  sorry.  I know, that's fine.  I was only going to ask this,  actually, a stupid question.  That actually was more enjoyable.  Are you there, dude?  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  Oh, did you, what?  It's weird,  the one doctor to go,  you got to feel this,  was something wrong? 
[00:55:30]  See, that's the thing.  I don't remember.  I never had to get anything treated.  And I mean,  I was just saying,  hey, come here,  you got to feel this.  Wow.  All right, well, good.  Lucky you.  Worked that nice for you.  All right, sir.  You were probably, like,  I don't know,  part of a cult or something.  They just kind of used you  for their own pleasure.  Yeah, I think the doctor  was just kind of like,  hey, you got to feel this.  Come here, check this out. 
[00:56:00]  You know what we usually feel?  Well, check this one out.  All right, thanks, Adam.  Thank you.  It's really tough to do anything  with your phone call.  Trust me, we could do a lot,  but maybe not over here.  That'd be nice.  Hey, the tiger attack  at the San Francisco Zoo,  they're releasing the 911 call.  These are always great to listen to.  911.  And we got some audio of that.  Operator tells caller to calm down.  Well, this is the guy,  I guess his brother and his friend  are being mauled by the tiger,  and he's frantically trying to get help. 
[00:56:30]  And I don't know.  It seems if you're frantic on 911,  there's going to be a problem.  Sure.  The people on 911,  the people that they get to work there,  for some reason,  don't like when you're really worked up.  Over an emergency.  But the whole thing is,  you're calling because you're worked up.  Something really bad is happening.  And the only reason you go,  calm down, calm down,  to someone that is in a stressful situation  is because you can't handle it. 
[00:57:00]  You can't handle what you're hearing,  seeing,  so you're like,  calm down, calm down.  Calm down, calm down.  Get the info.  Right.  No one's going to calm down  when they're in a frantic situation.  So to say,  calm down, calm down,  is just dumb.  You have to be able to get that person  to give you the information,  even in one of those states of confusion  and anger and fear and sadness,  whatever it is.  But for some reason,  they're just like,  look,  I'm not going to help you  unless,  why?  You're 911. 
[00:57:30]  It's your job.  Help.  Yeah.  I got cussed by Hillary.  Jerome in Michigan.  Very good.  So here's the operator  telling the caller to calm down,  which never works.  I'm just going to stay on the line with you  until the paramedics are with you,  all right?  Okay.  Excuse me.  Can you check up on them?  We'll see where they are.  They're on scene right now,  but they have to stage  until they're given permission  to go inside.  It's coming out of nothing.  Okay, no.  I understand that, 
[00:58:00]  but at the same time,  we have to make sure  that paramedics don't get chewed out  because if the paramedics get hurt,  then nobody's going to help you.  Okay, I understand that,  all right?  I'm starting.  Okay, the ambulance is staging.  I need you to understand  that if the ambulance,  people, the paramedics,  okay, calm down, all right?  I am going to stay on the line with you.  If the paramedics get hurt,  they cannot help your brother, 
[00:58:30]  so you need to calm down.  Some more paramedics get.  You are going to be the best help  for your brother right now.  She's right.  She's actually right on that one.  She's trying to tell them  that they can't go in,  and what are they supposed to do?  Just ask a tiger to step aside?  There's treatment to be done?  And he's panicking, of course.  Yeah, it sucks to be you.  You know, the paramedics  don't feel like losing their lives.  They're going to do what they can, but...  I don't know.  It seems to me like in that situation,  you just got to pretty much think quickly. 
[00:59:00]  The way she said,  they're staging.  Like, you picture them  just kind of hanging out.  They should jump out of their vehicles  with, like, fire extinguishers  and run to the scene  and, you know,  get the goddamn tiger out of the way  so they can help the guy out.  No.  Not fire extinguishers.  No?  Guns.  No.  Tiger?  I think a tiger would be scared  crapless of a  fire extinguisher like that.  You might be right,  but it might...  You imagine, like,  you're a paramedic.  You're trying to push a stretcher  and there's a wild animal 
[00:59:30]  charging you.  Here.  He jumps right through the foam  and bites you.  He likes the foam.  He likes the foam.  Oh, foam!  Right.  It just takes your face right off.  Yeah.  Makes it a little easier  for you to go down his throat.  He wants to attack you  and get you away from the foam  so he can play in it by himself  because foam rules.  That's a rough one,  but maybe you don't go  to the zoo with slingshots.  Yeah, exactly.  Was this one of the slingshot kids 
[01:00:00]  we're listening to?  Yep.  If they slingshot.  All right, we got a little more here.  Paramedics had to wait  before entering, of course.  What's going on here?  Okay.  I've been on you  but I'm going to call with you  for eight minutes  and I called 10 minutes  before I go to 20 minutes.  Okay, I'm trying to explain to you  that we have to make sure  that we can get inside safely.  All right?  How long does it take?  I do not know that  because I'm not out there right now,  but we have specialists.  Oh, she's BS-ing now. 
[01:00:30]  We have 16 different police units  plus about six different paramedic  and fire department personnel  We'll rush in there.  Out there trying to...  You just have to make sure  that the Tiger doesn't hurt  any of the emergency units  otherwise there's going to be  nobody to help you, all right?  So just stay calm.  I'm going to stay on the phone with you.  Help a brother out.  Come on.  I don't want to hear  that the cops are out there  planning something.  Yeah, go charge.  Charge.  Everyone thinks people  are going to go charge 
[01:01:00]  to save your life.  They've got some decisions  to make in their heads, too.  It's never as fast as you need it.  It's not like the movies.  It's real life.  Everyone expects,  all right, one, two, three, charge!  And they run in, yeah.  Let's take the Tiger out  and save this kid.  Doesn't happen that way.  Just doesn't.  You're right.  Were there slingshots?  As a cop, too,  you have to be scared  when you're going in there  because there's no way  to talk a Tiger down  so you know you're going  to have to use your weapon 
[01:01:30]  and you're going to have  to be accurate.  Yeah.  As a cop,  like they say cops  have nightmares  that they shoot  and the bullet  just kind of falls out  or whatever.  That's like a cop's nightmare.  Are you scared  that you're going to  shoot this Tiger  and it's still going to leap?  Going to come at you, yeah.  Yeah, because you're  trained to shoot people.  You know that effect,  but an angry Tiger.  Yeah, but you could just  unload your whole thing  and don't have to worry  about the Tiger's family  suing you  or Tiger Sharpton  coming after you  or anything like that.  The Reverend Tiger.  I've heard similar things. 
[01:02:00]  But yeah, I guess so.  But it's still frightening.  But yeah, it's got to be  because they could just  leap out of anywhere, too.  Yeah.  What if a Tiger  doesn't get hurt by this?  Yeah.  There's not a big enough bullet.  A very big cat.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  That's released today.  I want to play something  Ant's been ranting and raving  about his blackjack play.  It's got people talking  and debating  both sides of your philosophy.  And we're going to have  what's his name again?

And he's an expert  on the casinos  and especially blackjack.  So he's calling the show today.  And we're going to  just explain  what Anthony thinks.  And we'll get to the bottom  of the whole thing.  And we're going to get  to the bottom of...  Yeah, exactly.  But Tim, down the hall,  took one of Anthony's rants  and came up with this.

[01:04:00]  within a half hour  to discuss this further  and get you all...  Solve this whole thing  so I...  Get you all riled up.  Don't have to go  through that again.  Laurie for me  before we go to break.  Yeah, well...  Laurie.  Hi.  Hi, what's up?  Well, I was just  listening to your show,  and I was listening  to the guy who called in  and said he was 13 years old  and had a rectal exam.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a physician assistant,  and there's no way  two doctors  give a 13-year-old 
[01:04:30]  a rectal exam.  No.  Unless there was something  seriously wrong with him.  But he said  at the beginning  of the exam,  I mean,  the show that  it was just a routine exam  and his mother was there.  Yeah.  There's no freaking way  that two doctors  would do a rectal exam  on a 13-year-old.  Maybe it was more  than a routine exam  and they weren't  telling him, no?  Maybe, yeah.  Keep him calm.  What he failed to explain  was that the doctor  was actually his stepfather  and mommy enjoyed  the relationship 
[01:05:00]  she was currently in  and would do anything  to keep that relationship going.  It's called co-signing.  Right.  Like not calling  the authorities  when you should.  He also forgot to mention  that it wasn't done  in a doctor's office.  Yeah.  Waka waka.  Oh, wait.  You get one of these.  All right, Laurie.  Well, the guy  didn't explain much,  you know.  Well, I just thought,  you know,  I should put some  fact into that little story. 
[01:05:30]  I think he's making  the whole thing up.  Oh, maybe.  Wouldn't be the first time  we were pwned.  Yeah, a lot of fakers  out there.  It happens.  After the break.  All right, we got  all the main candidates  and the songs  they're using.  Oh.  Why would she use  that version of that song?  All right, we'll name  the candidate  and maybe you guys  could guess what  the song is.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  And now I understand  why Bill Richards  dropped out of the  freaking race. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, did he have a  doesn't know music.  Lame song.  A very lame song.  He officially dropped out,  right?  Bill Richards?  Yeah.  Bill Richards from  Arizona, that guy?  New Mexico?  Where was he from?  New Mexico, whatever.  Yeah, New Mexico.  They're saying he was  like the most qualified  by the way, but no one  gives a crap.  No one cared.  Most people that try  to stay neutral in this  whole process, they're  like, he's probably the  most qualified.  I think.  And no one's paying  attention to him.  The immigration thing  kind of bit him a little  bit. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he can't really  piss off a lot of the  people, his constituency  down there.  Right.  Democrat, Republican?  I think he was Democrat,  wasn't he?  Bill?  Was he?  I would go Democrat.  Yeah, yeah.  You might be right.  Wow.  That just seems like a  very Democratic state in  Mexico.  All right, we'll do that  next.  I don't know.  The candidate and what's  on they're using on the  campaign trail.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Hey.  It's the Opie and Anthony  show. 
[01:07:00]  It certainly is.  Slugging its way across  America.  Yuck.  More wonderful news last  night.  In this smoke, two joints.  Dude.  It's Friday.  Yeah, dude.  It's my Friday song.  I'll never be able to  listen to this song in any  version without thinking  of that guy.  Good old Rocco. 
[01:07:30]  Rock Hole.  Where is Rock Hole these  days?  Selling cars in Worcester.  You think?  That's the last I heard.  Selling cars.  You guys feel just like him,  but would you like talk to  him?  He's not even on my radar,  Jimmy.  Not even on my radar.  It's like would I talk to a  bug on the floor?  Probably not.  Perhaps not.  He's not on my radar.  Greg Hill's not on my radar. 
[01:08:00]  No.  Bruce Mittman's not on my  radar anymore.  Going very inside for Boston,  I understand.  Bruce, who likes to, you  know, talk to the Boston  Herald, how we're self-destructive  and this and that, as he sits  and rots doing nothing in radio.  Supporting the Hill man who's  done nothing in radio, except  sit at the same station for over  10 years, getting okay ratings.  But we're crazy.  We're insane. 
[01:08:30]  Chair that just must stink like  ugh.  Sitting there for all those years  in that chair.  By the way, because Bruce...  Eating poorly.  Bruce does, listen, you weren't  fooling anybody.  You were the secret source.  When you talked to the Herald  the last time we had a bit of a  problem.  Go F yourself.  Midget.  Anyway, I was checking out  American Idol last night. 
[01:09:00]  And we got the campaign song.  We got so much.  And we got Scientology audio by  Tom Cruise himself.  Tom Cruise.  Just sounding nuts.  We definitely got to do that  before we get out of here.  Get out of the campaign.  Want to hear that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  How about a little taste of  the American Idol?  A lot of people watching this  show.  Yeah.  A little taste.  How about a taste?  We'll go with the taste.  All right.  We don't have to do a full  fledged break on this.  I usually catch the premiere  episode.  I think it's T-Vote, but T-Vote,  you know, DVR.  I didn't catch it last night.  I was bored, man. 
[01:09:30]  I watched the first half hour,  40 minutes.  There were a few laughs.  A few of the people definitely  worth at least replaying for the  people out there.  And then I turned it off.  I'm like, it's the same crap.  Dude, I know.  You know, and I was always a big  kind of fan of especially the  first few episodes where they go  through the freaks and the  people that suck and a couple of  good singers, but I couldn't be  bothered last night.  I really couldn't give a crap.  You know what's great about the  freaks when American Idol first  started?  They didn't know they were freaks.  They really thought they had a  talent and American Idol exposed 
[01:10:00]  them for what they are.  And somewhere along the line,  people became aware of that and  realized, I could get on TV just  being really weird.  It's like what happens to any  reality show that goes a few  seasons.  Like, remember the original real  world?  Right.  And it was kind of real people  put all together in a place to  live.  And now it looks like the O.C.  Oh, yeah.  It's like an episode of Laguna  Beach or something.  Right.  It's not real anymore. 
[01:10:30]  It's not real people.  They pick like people that should  be actors and they have this one,  the whore, the gay guy, the black  guy that's just angry and angry.  And they cast these things like a  TV show.  And what happened, because, you  know, we watched the real world  when it started here in New York  and then San Francisco and L.A.  And it used to be based on a lot of  stuff going on in the house.  Now it's all about getting them as  effed up as possible and getting  them in a bar. 
[01:11:00]  And putting them in a bar and trying  to have them hook up and stuff like  that.  American Idol, the same things  happened.  People realize they don't have to be  good to be famous.  When the show first started, you  had to be one of the good singers  to be famous.  Now it's if you're really bad, you  go on tour, you do commercials and  you get endorsement deals.  So it's just this whole beginning  portion, especially, has just become  phony also.  William Hung is the one that I 
[01:11:30]  think accidentally started people  saying, well, you know, if he could  do it, I could go up there and be an  idiot and yeah, well, but it's it's  worth taking a listen to this guy.  I think it's I think his name is  Uka or Uka.  He's from Egypt and he loves  America.  The Egyptian magician.  He doesn't sound like that really.  No, he's from Egypt and he he loves  America.  He's got the opportunity to live in 
[01:12:00]  America.  He can't get enough.  Loves it.  Oh, man.  He doesn't like America.  No, no, no, really likes it.  Oh, he really likes it.  Wait a minute.  So that's a bit more than that, Jim.  And if if we don't play this one  line from the show yesterday,  something will be broken in studio.  Something will be broken.  This is the only reason we're doing  this break right now.  He rocks a neck because he starts  talking about how much he likes  women and how he explains it is.  Wow.  Let's meet Uka from last night's 
[01:12:30]  American Idol.  Thank you.  I love soft music.  I love my glove songs.  Yes.  Makes me feel like better.  Makes me feel happy.  Yep.  I love the Bee Gees.  I want to sing Mr. Bee Gees.  His group, he makes me feel like  Mr. Bee Gees.  He likes the Bee Gees and he likes  going to sing Mr. Bee Gees.  Mr. Bee Gees.  Mr. Bee Gees.  Which one is that?  I love the Bee Gees.  I want to sing Mr. Bee Gees. 
[01:13:00]  His group, he makes me feel like  I fly in the sky.  That's why Mr. Bee Gees makes me feel  so special for me.  And I like him so much.  Oh, God.  This guy's a classic.  Yeah.  He's got a huge space in between  his two top teeth.  Big gappy teeth.  He's all about, he's just smiling  and he loves Mr. Bee Gees.  Mr. Bee Gees.  And he starts talking about his friend 
[01:13:30]  and his love for women.  I have my friend.  She's very pretty.  And she told me,  Yuka, you are sexy face.  I say, all right, thank you very much.  You are sexy face.  I say, all right, thank you very much.  You know, but then the Jew.  Right.  He's got a little Borat slash.  Nas.  Nas.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Sexy face is Nas.  And this is the clip where if I was drinking something, 
[01:14:00]  I would have spit it out  and I pretty much fell on the floor last night.  This better be the clip.  You love women?  Yeah, I love women.  Okay, that's good.  You have kids?  I'm not married.  Why?  Because you're not married?  You can't have kids?  Yeah.  Welcome to the new city, baby,  because that's all that's going on over here.  I save myself to when I get the good girl  and I want to love a girl from the hair to the nipple. 
[01:14:30]  And, yeah, I want to give her all my life for her.  That's it?  Wow.  Just from the hair to the nipple, he said.  That's where he wants to love a girl.  The rest of the torso could just be thrown out.  Yes.  Well, for him, that's probably really sexy.  From the hair.  Anything more uncovered and he just loses his mind.  From the hair to the nipple of our nose. 
[01:15:00]  He made it so unsexy.  I want to love a woman from her hair to her nipple.  All right.  That guy's a little confused with English, but.  All right.  You want to hear him sing or does it matter?  Yeah, let's hear a little bit of him.  All right.  It's okay.  Okay.  Okay.  And you like Paula, it says here.  Yeah, because she's a good singer.  She's had a pretty, pretty, like, voice.  I like her.  People are doing their impressions on this and feedback. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Pleasure for me.  Pleasure for me to sing this song, to love the girl from the hair to the nipple.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Pleasure for me.  Madison Square Garden.  Greatest city in the world.  The nipple capital of the world.  The, like, voice.  I like her because she dance good.  And, uh, yes.  All right.  You would like to dance with her to be your woman. 
[01:16:00]  You would like her to dance with you.  I wish.  Mm.  But he's terrible.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And finally, he sings.  I know you're rising in the morning sun.  I feel you touch me in the morning rain.  When the moment lets you wander far probably, I want to see you in my arms again. 
[01:16:30]  And you come to me in the summer breeze.  Keep me warm in your love and softly.  And it's me you need to show.  How deep is your love?  Is your love how deep is your love?  Thank you.  Okay.  I wish he'd fall off the Verrazano Bridge.  As far as Egyptians go, I'd rather hear, I'm an Al-Zawari singer.  Well. 
[01:17:00]  But he doesn't know he's bad.  That's the beauty of this kid.  Well, I'm going to throw this one to Paula.  I'm very impressed with how you phonetically learned the songs.  That's very good.  He doesn't know what that means.  And I appreciate the work that you put into it.  Yeah.  And what did you think of his performance?  I think that this, that, I think, I appreciate you so much.  Thank you for your hard work. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yes, well.  Yeah.  But I do not think this is the competition.  Why?  It's okay.  Why?  All right, Lee, man.  I definitely got to say no.  Singing's not your thing, though.  It's okay.  That's good.  Well, we like you, though.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  See how Simon realizes what complete dullards he's working with, and he's trying to get  them now to say nasty things.  Come on.  Why?  Why don't you like them?  Say it.  Address your alcoholism, you lush.  Say something nasty. 
[01:18:00]  How about you, you Oreo?  You got anything to say?  You bespectacled Oreo.  Bespectacled.  All right.  Well, maybe we'll play a little more later.  There's another guy with a very deep voice that, wow.  Yeah.  Woo.  We'll try to get to him in a few minutes.  All right.  So campaign songs.  You got the big candidates, and they're all trying to get that one song that everyone  can latch on to.  The hit, the one that people link up, like Bill Clinton, and Don't Stop Thinking About  Tomorrow. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  That was a biggie.  We start with Mitt Romney.  Mitt Romney.  What do you think, Mitt Romney?  What kind of song would Mitt Romney have?  Paperback writer.  Ling, ling.  Oh, wait.  Mitt Romney.  Mitt Romney.  He is a...  Mitt Romney is a...  You could probably figure out these songs.  That's why this is a good exercise.  What religion is he?  He's a Mormon.  Yes, a Mormon.  So I would say it's something by the Mormon Tabernacle Quar. 
[01:19:00]  Well.  Am I correct?  I don't think his people would think that would be good.  Universal.  Right.  It's going to be a little universal.  Okay.  So let's go with something from Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  Wow.  No.  Damn, I thought I hit the lotto on that one.  Oh, did you fake me out?  I'm like, no way. 
[01:19:30]  Is it?  How about you give us the band?  Because it's too...  You never know.  Because they might even have to like the song themselves.  Well, in this case, the band's not going to get the job done.  But think conservative music as far as living in the year 2008.  Like you're trying to come up with a song.  Oh, it's got to be country.  You're trying to come up with a song that you feel is hip, but it's conservative right now.  The house next door to me was...  Oh, hey.  How about...  Very safe.  This is a very safe artist in the year 2008.  Okay.  How about... 
[01:20:00]  All right.  All right.  We'll let them into heaven.  He went with this song.  It's Elvis.  Oh, Elvis.  A pop dance remix of Elvis.  A little less conversation.  So when he hits the stage, they play this.  Which is awful.  You don't get hyped up.  Does he shake his hips when he comes out?  This shows a little bit of being out of touch.  Very.  A drug addict that died on the toilet. 
[01:20:30]  That's who you want.  No one's getting excited when that plays and he's making his way to the stage.  Not at all.  Mitt Romney's a jerk.  All right.  Let's move on to John Edwards.  What do you think John Edwards would do?  Oh, boy.  Something dull.  Yeah.  He's a dullard.  Bravo already.  Is it?  Bravo.  Blunt.  You're beautiful to Stonehenge because it's the only thing larger than his skull.  No.  Long way.  Something dull.  A band or solo artist?  Solo. 
[01:21:00]  Used to be in a band.  Solo artist.  Used to be in a band.  Solo artist with the same name that his band was.  Oh, okay.  Rob Zombie?  Had many versions.  Living Dead Girl.  Many versions of his name over the years?  Oh.  John Cougar, Melonhead.  Wow.  Very good.  Yeah.  Different versions of his name.  That's what got me.  Ain't that America?  No.  No.  A new song.  Yeah.  One of his new songs?  A song called My Country. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, this is.  Our Country.  Oh, it's.  Our Country.  Oh, V-Rack corrected you.  It was tight.  My friend.  My Country.  Is this car commercial stuff, right?  Yeah.  Oh, he's using it for his campaign.  This song.  Of the people of this land.  This is our country.  Little Diddy.  The Jack and Diane.  Oh, sorry.  All right.  Enough of that.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  Whatever.  Rudy G.  Rudy.  Rudy Giuliani.  I say Rudy's going for Sinatra.  What's his official campaign song?  You couldn't be further from the truth.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  How could he put 9-11 to music?  I already know this song.  Oh, do you?  It ain't heavy.  It's my prostate.  It's my prostate.  Well, it's a remake. 
[01:22:30]  A remake?  Yeah.  Who did this originally?  Tom Cochran, right?  Life is a Highway?  Yeah.  Done by Brasco Flats.  Jimmy's disgusted.  They put that Cher pitch thing in there. 
[01:23:00]  The original is way better.  Mike in Boston.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Actually, wait.  It's Boston Tom.  Okay.  Romney is a Mormon, so it should be Two Girls for Every Boy by the Beach Boys.  Should be his campaign.  A little joke there.  All right.  Mike Huckabee.  Oh.  I thought you were going to say Michael.  Michael Hunt.  No.  Mike.  All right.  Mike Huckabee.  It's got to be something country. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  I'm thinking.  Artist leans country, sure.  Yeah.  A lot of country fans.  A lot of southern fans.  Yeah.  There's a big clue right there.  All right.  A lot of southern fans.  Hmm.  So far, the Candidate songs are atrocious.  Really?  They're out of touch.  They're corn balls.  Right.  No one cares.  I could never guess this.  Don't try to be hip and like relevant.  Lean country.  Huge southern following. 
[01:24:00]  Garth Brooks.  May have had a plane crash.  Oh.  Oops.  Leonard Skinner.  Oh.  He went with Free Bird.  Mike Huckabee.  He is free as a bird now.  Yeah.  He's going to be free to do whatever he wants when someone else is president.  Doesn't have to talk as much.  No.  How about...  Yeah.  The song ends and everyone leaves.  God, he hit the stage nine minutes ago.  How about the ballad of Curtis Lowe because his chances are as dead as Curtis Lowe is. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  I got that one.  I liked it.  We go to Ron Paul.  Do we have his song?  No.  I'm Ron Paul R. Nelson.  All we got for Ron Paul, it's written this way.  Some song one of his creepy supporters wrote for him, but no one has the song.  Really?  Yeah.  It's some just kind of song that someone came up for him.  Yes.  All right.  We'll move on to Bill Richardson, who dropped out of the race. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  He was New Mexico's whatever.  Let's see.  Think Mexico.  Think...  I will.  Think that type of...  Freddy Fender.  All right.  Keep thinking.  Okay.  Mexico.  Hey, you.  Get off of my lawn.  The sombrero dance song.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Something really just racially insensitive and silly. 
[01:25:30]  Los Lobos.  Oh, of course.  This song.  We don't have that one.  Oh, we don't have...  We don't have a Los Lobos song?  And we have a master computer that has every song.  By the way, that is Spanish for the Lobos.  Our computer has more songs.  It's Spanish.  Thank you.  Our computer has more songs than iTunes, and they don't have the song in there.  You don't have that Los Lobos?  A song called Mess We're In by Los Lobos.  Do they have more songs on iTunes?  This thing?  Yeah.  I think so.  Could be.  Hillary Clinton. 
[01:26:00]  I'd love to have an hour and 15 minutes from now start talking about what her song is.  Hillary Clinton.  Someone's suggesting Spinal Tap's Big Bottom.  No?  No.  She blinded me with cankles.  I can't see.  It's Steve from Bayshore.  With cankles.  Oh, God.  Hillary.  What song would Hillary have? 
[01:26:30]  It's not Fat Bottom Girl.  No?  No.  Oh.  Let's see.  Hillary.  I don't know.  A remake, by the way.  Of course.  Of an amazing song.  Really?  And another one of those lean country, huge southern followings.  Bans.  Oh, God.  They might have had a motorcycle accident back in the day.  Uh-huh.  Allman Brothers.  Keep in with that theme. 
[01:27:00]  But she doesn't go with the original.  She goes with the Big Head Todd and the Monsters version.  Ew.  What's that?  Exactly.  Listen.  Yes, you can change the world.  True love discovers as she stands.  What the hell is this?  Wow, this isn't a remake of Blue Sky.  No.  It's a song called Blue Sky, so I was assuming it was Blue Sky.  Oh.  But it's an unrecognizable song. 
[01:27:30]  Good job, Hillary.  Good job.  Yeah.  Good job.  This is just like your hubby did.  Way to bring in the young voters.  Good job.  Good job.  Awful.  Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Blue Sky.  And then I got to give it to Barack.  I'm sorry.  He's got a great song.  Barack's got the song?  Yeah, the song.  What is it?  Used to give me chills when I would hear it.  It's one of those songs.  Go to the club.  No, it's you too.  The City of Blinding Lights. 
[01:28:00]  Doesn't make sense.  Wow.  Who's looking beautiful for him?  America.  America.  The City of Blinding Lights.  Oh.  It's all about America.  It looks beautiful to him.  I get it now.  Yes.  Look before you laugh.  Look ugly in a photograph.  Oh, I thought it was going to be that F the police.  F the, F the, F the police. 
[01:28:30]  No?  No.  You should have went with a black artist.  You should have.  Try to go with you too.  Like you listen to them.  Go with something you enjoy.  He's just trying to win over a white artist.  Maybe he does listen to you too, though.  No, he doesn't.  Black people like black artists.  White people like white artists.  That's what my fodder says, and that's the way it is.  Then explain Billy Preston.  Who is that?  Fifth Beatle.  Was he?  Really?  Well, he was in there.  He mixed it up with the Beatles.  All right. 
[01:29:00]  Huh?  Sorry.  Every time I hear the Beatles now, I just think of poor George Harrison.  I know.  His old pudding head.  It's so, so awful.  Leaky ears.  He's trying to sign a guitar.  Hey, I think we could squeeze this in.  Remember, I suggested the other day, I think it was like, wow, Monday.  Good job, guys.  That we go on the street and just ask who they're voting for and why.  And this is where it just gets scary, because these candidates are working really hard to 
[01:29:30]  get their message out there, and in the end, it doesn't mean nothing.  People don't know what the people stand for.  People are going to vote for Barack because he's black.  That cult of personality, man.  There are people out there that won't vote for Barack because he's black.  There are people that will vote for Hillary because she's a woman, and vice versa.  They won't vote for her because she is a woman.  Right.  And Rudy Giuliani, they're going to vote for him because he did well during 9-11.  That's what it basically comes down to.  They could babble all they want on TV, but in the end, a majority of the voters are just 
[01:30:00]  voting for ridiculous reasons.  Yep.  Okay?  And I think this proves that.  What's your name, sir?  Eric.  And registered Democrat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you leaning towards...  Even if I wasn't, I mean, with the person we have now, the two characters, you know,  if it was the opposite, I would vote with Barack.  It's just, you know, I want this mess over with.  What a rousy, too.  It was bad.  So as I... 
[01:30:30]  I want to punch that gentleman.  Yeah, he never really got to.  Some reason.  It's very annoying.  But that guy gets a vote.  That guy gets a vote.  He gets the vote.  I think we got part two of this guy, hopefully?  Yep.  Okay.  As a registered Democrat, you're obviously two main choices right now are Hillary Clinton  and Barack Obama.  I guess or Rom.  Yeah.  So is there one way you would lean, or...?  Oh, this is another classic story.  This is really weird, dog.  No.  You know, you got a person who's a black man running for a first time, and he's not actually 
[01:31:00]  black.  He's a mix.  The way I look at it.  And then you got a first woman.  So you put that together.  That's a real...  And I think they're both great people.  That guy gets a vote.  And he will be voting, by the way.  This is Matt's bid.  You got a bid, Matt, finally.  Yes.  Yay!  Turn Matt's got a bid.  You should do this every week.  All right, cool.  With that guy.  Every few days, you should just hand in, you know, your latest crop. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  You know, a guy like that would be great, though, to talk to on a regular basis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Imagine that idiot's take on anything.  Oh.  Yeah.  James is talking like this.  I just...  He's a mix the way I see it.  The way you see it?  Yeah.  Okay.  What?  Cross-eyed?  Through mo-bangs?  Did he ever give an answer?  No.  He just kept on rambling.  All right.  He just kept rambling.  We had to move on. 
[01:32:00]  Put the tree in front of it.  It's time for the family photo.  Make him stand behind the fern.  All right.  We...  The next one is an uppity white woman who's startled by the microphone.  Yeah.  I kind of...  I put out the mic so she can talk into it, and she was completely confused.  Just 30 seconds to a minute.  Who you're voting for and why.  Just a little survey we're doing.  What is...  What's the radio, ma'am?  I like Obama.  Any particular reason? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  I think he's intelligent.  He has as much experience as anyone else in terms of policymaking he's been in Congress.  What policies are you a fan of?  I like the fact that as much as he is against the war, he is not advocating a 60-day pullout,  which to me feeds right into the enemy. 
[01:33:00]  She gets a vote.  follow me to the voting booth  come on everybody let's go  this is the reality though i mean this is what it comes down to  she was speaking in these twisted versions of news sound bites 
[01:33:30]  yeah that's like where she got her information and just  that's where we all get our information no but you read one political book and you  think you're a genius you're ready for you know fox yeah well you are pretty much  right well matt ran into stalker patty  i have to go to work so who you're voting for in the upcoming election  i like james carrey the best james carrey yeah john carrey i mean excuse me i don't 
[01:34:00]  think he's running patty maybe not but he would have been the best choice  not maybe not no not maybe not he's not he's not running he's actually supporting  obama i believe right she is a don't just a don't  i don't know i like that jfk kid  and finally uh the last one for today matt but you'll get more soon right yep all  right maybe by friday this is this is a good bit all right uh the last guy's a black guy 
[01:34:30]  oh yeah you ran into oh yes and what's your name sir derrick and uh who you're voting for  obama obama why why because he's black okay  you know why not at least he's honest why not that's what we're dealing with of course it's just  because he's black of course this is what it comes down to obama is one of obama's policies  could be to bring back slavery and black people will still vote for him because he's black 
[01:35:00]  it's just it's beyond me i don't know but you're not voting for him because he's black no it's not  the truth i i would i would have seriously given colin powell uh consideration uh before he pulled that  debacle at the un when he he was on puppet strings talking about talking about the weapons that  weren't over there uh but you know i seriously would have given him consideration i'm looking at 
[01:35:30]  the color of his skin but obama on the other hand uh i just don't like his name that's why i  wouldn't vote for him let's get back to the black guy he's not enough experience we gotta take a break  because we got ben calling in to talk about blackjack and your theory and i don't like his wife  just gotta move on he's bossy right here here's the rest of the black guy and uh who you're voting  for obama obama why why because he's black okay we need change and i think he's a good he'll make  a good candidate if not obama hillary why because it's the first time for everything you should make 
[01:36:00]  a great president i'm a democrat anyway fair enough excuse me i have to run the police are coming  you beat me to it i'm gonna go i'm gonna go mad why didn't you tell the police he's right here  he's got me man i gotta leave this interview right as you can see there's a situation at hand  that i gotta flee man good job uh that's the start of it we'll get more more uh reaction from the  street as far as uh who or people vote for and why yeah and when you ask the why question you gotta 
[01:36:30]  make sure the why because it's just fascinating yeah why people vote for somebody yeah policy  question was a good one because nobody wants to be stupid enough to go i don't know any of their  policy so they're gonna come up with something yeah yeah so you the best thing instead of just  why you're voting for him although use that too because the guy just saying because he's black is  really good uh but maybe after that go well what policies do you agree with or like or and yeah and  i like the fact if you say it like you're challenging them that's bad if you say like oh cool which one 
[01:37:00]  of their policies would you like if you're agreeing with them and maybe we could have something like  with each candidate you have one thing that you know that they're not for but you say how do you  feel that he's come out since he's come out and said this even though he said the polar opposite you  see if they catch on does that make any sense but it can't be too obvious that's on it yeah he's doing  a good job so far i tried to kept on you know pushing them forward and forward to see if i can catch  them in a complete liar yeah just if they're just making stuff up to try to sound smart you just ask 
[01:37:30]  enough why's or why is that and people will just lose their mind and just start babbling but ask  it like this why why but but why why just keep going but why and they give the answer and go well  why is that and then they give that answer you go but why i don't know i don't know we want every  interview to break down to okay i just don't know anything stop asking me i thought i sounded smart  for a sound bite all right ben mesrick on the phone next to talk about blackjack and anthony's 
[01:38:00]  whole thing this this is thank god this is uh taking on a little bit of a life of its own yep  your theory and the debating that's been going on the last couple days we'll explain to the newbies  if you haven't heard after the break opian anthony we gotta get right back into this it's the opian  anthony show moving by very quickly today we got ben on the phone ben mesrick or ben mesrich  always pronounce his name wrong mesrick you think yeah he wrote uh bringing down the house he's got 
[01:38:30]  that movie i think it's called 21 starring uh kevin spacey that's coming out uh the trailer did  really well i'm hearing did it yeah yeah online or whatever uh ben what's going on hey how you doing  what's up i'm doing i'm doing good i'm getting ready for the movie and everything yeah when's the  movie coming out the movie uh comes out uh march 28th um but we're opening the south by southwest  film festival on march 7th um in austin so and this is the movie based on bringing down the house 
[01:39:00]  but you had to change the name right yeah it's based on the book i wrote about the mit kids who  took vegas with their blackjack scheme right um and we had to change the title because there was  already a bringing down the house with queen latifah oh yeah that's right crap stupid stupid stupid  white guy steve martin wacky dancing should be shot yeah all right but you know when we get  closer to the movie we'll have you back in and we'll do the big promotion but uh you're an expert  on blackjack and that's why you're calling today because uh our pal anthony i think you know because  you've been on the show a few times he likes his blackjack yeah no he doesn't he doesn't like his 
[01:39:30]  blackjack jimmy he loves it yeah yeah anthony loves blackjack and he and he's a high roller uh you  know they they just flew him up to mohegan sun he's considered a whale basically they want their money  back because he took him for a few and uh anthony uh plays high stake and he's got this philosophy  i guess anthony could explain it i'll explain and i want to get your reaction to this of course ben uh  you'll you'll know exactly what i'm talking about but uh explain it to the listeners i had a little 
[01:40:00]  bit of an issue with a gentleman that sat down i'm making uh pretty big bets there i'm sitting there  i'm betting about i'm betting two spots about sixth grand a spot so so i'm betting like twelve  thousand dollars for each uh each uh hand that comes out and uh some guy comes over and he plays  the minimum which i think was two thousand dollars or something uh two hundred dollars i'm sorry at that  table uh and he's not playing smart he's not playing by the typical rules of blackjack the dealer is 
[01:40:30]  showing a a picture card uh he's got a 13 or a 14 and he's staying okay um i'm sitting there now  freaking out going this guy's a loose cannon i don't need that i'm playing against the dealer i  don't want to have to play against this guy and the dealer um and it's it's pissing off the table 
[01:41:00]  everyone else in this studio is saying why should that matter uh what does that do it doesn't change  the cards what if it works out in your favor i go it could it does it has in the past but on average  i i don't like uh uh that happening because he's going to screw me right uh you know here's the  thing i mean if you're getting into a groove and you're feeling good and everything he can  you know throw you off your game statistically mathematically he's not really going to screw 
[01:41:30]  you statistically or mathematically it doesn't make a difference right but but you know in most like  good casinos if you're playing that big you could probably you know the the pit boss wouldn't  necessarily let him sit there exactly messing with your play you know it can take you off your game  and also if you're card counting it can make a difference ben oh that's that's what i said  yesterday so if you're counting cards and he's not making the plays that would be expected of  someone who's playing by the rules it matters but if he's not counting cards does it matter it won't  do anything to your game other than why you're not counting cards at all if you're not keeping 
[01:42:00]  track of the faith cards at all if you're not keeping track of the aces if you're not keeping  track of the small cards if you're not doing any of that and you're just playing you know by luck  then it really shouldn't matter mathematically but i do understand that it's annoying well i do i do look  at at the number of low cards that come out um you're keeping a good track of low cards and you've  got a guy who's not taking when you think he's going to take a low card and that changes the way you 
[01:42:30]  think but really really it shouldn't make a big difference mathematically well ben i i'll jump in  i i understand what and's talking about on an emotional level because you want to focus on  what you're doing and stuff and this could take you off your game and you're getting pissed off  this guy because you feel like he's not playing it right and that's going to distract you to the  point where maybe you start making dumb bets and things like that you're not you're just not  focused but i don't i don't really understand the the logic that a lot of these guys have like  anthony and i'm i don't play cards so i'm not trying to say i'm an expert here that it actually 
[01:43:00]  mathematically affects you it doesn't mathematically affect you but i mean like you said i mean it could  help you as much as it could hurt you and and the numbers don't really change you know against you  because some guy is making dumb moves next to you i do get up and leave if you were keeping if you  were keeping up with it you know keeping track of all the cards and a guy was doing strange things  next to you it would change the way you'd have to play because you'd have to take that into account  right if you're not keeping track of the cards but you know if you are keeping track of the low  cards that might also change the way you're going to play too because maybe you're expecting you know 
[01:43:30]  there's a certain number of low cards left you have one of them aimed at the dealer and suddenly this  guy next to you is you know changing the way he's going to take low cards that would that could affect  you yeah just playing by luck no no i well i i do keep track of the cards coming out of the shoe if  there are a lot of low cards coming out then i know at the back end of the shoe we might have a lot of  uh uh high cards coming out of there and sometimes this guy either hitting when he's not supposed to  or not hitting uh kind of throws me and it does throw me off my game because i i don't like that 
[01:44:00]  loose cannon there i feel like i'm playing against the dealer it's me and the dealer and if i start  that's legitimate if you saw a whole bunch of low cards come out and so you assume there's lots of  10s jack kings and queens waiting in there and then you've got some guy sitting next to you hitting  on a 17 or an 18 well he's going to take one of those 10 king kings that you have aimed at the  dealer so yeah that would make a difference or if he's hitting on his uh 14 when the deal is showing  a six uh you know that annoys me that that annoys me and you should be annoyed i'm not trying to say 
[01:44:30]  you shouldn't be annoyed if you're keeping track of the cards then you have every right to get him  uh it says note and changing his story i'm not changing my story i i i'm fine i'm finding out  the listeners are getting to him again i'm finding out that that ben says and he's an expert that it  doesn't legitimately affect the odds of uh what of you winning or not so having this loose cannon 
[01:45:00]  sitting next to you you still have the same odds of either winning or losing the same amount of money  as you would if you had a guy that was playing by the book if you're just playing straight blackjack  basic strategy right then it shouldn't make any difference to the odds because your odds are  going to be about two and a half percent down you know you're going to lose two and a half percent  pretty much every hand you play on average and no matter what this guy next to you is doing it's not  really going to change because you don't it's just random if you're not playing you know keeping  track of the cards pretty much why is it such a taboo then to have these idiots sit down next to you 
[01:45:30]  and why in the high roller room uh will they really uh frown upon having these guys at the table  in the high roller room they want to do everything to keep the the car you know the guys like you  playing they don't want you getting up from the table annoyed so if they've got someone who annoys  you and takes you off your game that if you leave with your six thousand dollar bet that's a big blow  to them if this guy leaves with his two hundred dollar bet they don't care so they'd much rather kick 
[01:46:00]  him out and keep you happy because you're going to be losing two and a half percent of every six  thousand dollar bet he's just losing two and a half percent of what he's probably losing he's hurting  himself more making these dumb mistakes right losing 10 percent a hand see i think you know i think  what ben and i were saying was was that it is uh if you're counting the cards it makes a difference  if you know i'm glad thank you ben i am glad you agree with me because uh ben i saw that kind of the  same way you're an ass all right hey ben we're real busy today but we just want to get you on 
[01:46:30]  to uh talk about that a little bit anything else you want to add to it or yeah well i mean that's  you know yeah keep on playing but next time just ask the guy to tell that guy to leave you know  yeah well i did i left the table um and sat down at another table and the second they were starting  to deal that idiot sat down next to me again and i i grabbed my chips i i looked at the dealer i go  i can't play at this table and he goes why and i just looked over at the guy and goes i said look  i just can't play here and he understood exactly what i meant sure which you know they all know 
[01:47:00]  that you don't want to sit next to an idiot like that that's going to just make the table angry i  can see where it will distract you throw off your game psychologically it definitely has uh an effect  i thought there was a numerical disadvantage to having somebody sitting there i will admit i was wrong  i will admit i was wrong that i thought there was a numerical disadvantage but i will not uh back  off on the fact that i cannot play at a table when someone's doing that because it affects the way i bet 
[01:47:30]  it affects the way i i uh double down i don't want i don't want to do things that are now depending  on this guy not doing something stupid and screwing me up i feel like i'm playing i feel like i have two  adversaries at the table now not just the dealer but this idiot sitting next to me all right well  maybe you're a natural card counter and you're card counting without even realizing it yeah this  may be this just in um hell is reporting uh 32 degrees today oh because well yeah 
[01:48:00]  no uh whoa  hey ben the big plug because we really got to move on because we got some uh tom cruise audio we  must play yeah my book rigged is on the stands right now still which is the oil book yeah the  true story of an ivy league kid who changed the world of oil from wall street to dubai yeah and  it's out there and it's just sort of a cool fun thing we just sold the movie rights on it so oh my  god be a movie as well yeah so keep on coming so we'll definitely see you soon man you're a great

[01:51:30]  our questions tomorrow but a uh tape has surfaced of tom cruise uh babbling about uh scientology  really and uh doesn't look um doesn't make him look good anytime anyone's babbling about that  religion they never sound they never sound uh rational yeah it's kind of an odd thing no matter  how they talk about it it just sounds like a bad science fiction movie that's all it sounds like 
[01:52:00]  like battlefield earth i'm gonna get a yogi what yeah you're gonna get your personal  yogi yeah yogi hey there no a yogi oh not a bear that talks and steals picnic baskets i'm gonna do  like some of that different intense yogurt yeah and i'm getting a personal yogi a personal yogi 
[01:52:30]  that will be like a therapist slash personal trainer slash spiritual advisor that's what i do now  oh no i'm shaving my head within weeks no you're not to start the process to cleanse to cleanse the  soul i don't think that works what no no what a yogi i cut my now cutting your hair i cut my hair  very short and it did nothing no no but it just made my head more obvious when i was driving my 
[01:53:00]  prostitutes i recognize that guy shaved head shaved head guy uh tom cruise here we go what a  scientologist can do and he's going to mention uh ksw in this clip that stands for keep scientology  working i think it's a privilege to call yourself a scientologist and it's something that you have to  earn and because a scientologist does he or she has the ability to create new and better realities 
[01:53:30]  and improve conditions uh being scientologist you look at someone and you know absolutely that you  can help them so for me it really is ksw and it's just like it's it's something that uh  i don't mince words with that you know with anything that lrh does but that policy to me has  really gone boy and i read i just time i went through i said you know what  when i read it i you know i just went this is it is exactly it he said absolutely nothing that was a 
[01:54:00]  babbling mess of nothing he doesn't seem like a very bright guy to me no no what'd you eat last  night wow that one took me out oh sorry it's metamucil wow wow did that he metamucil last night  wow jesus i'm sorry usually i'm all right that one is i've been dropping them all morning i can't help 
[01:54:30]  it wow oh my god my eyes are tearing well uh wow that hit me bad he uh he just doesn't he seems  like scientology to me seems like a fairly it seems fairly like uh almost like somebody's  saying you got to believe in yourself and it just seems like a fairly simple philosophy and if they  disagree with that well then how about you let us in on it stop keeping it such a secret yeah like  you know you want to be a real religion we want to be seen as a religion and taken seriously how  about you don't hide everything you know yeah it's all very secretive yeah why would it be secretive 
[01:55:00]  if you want to try to help everybody well because it's it sounds wacky to the the layman  they don't sit there and just go all right this is some kind of wacky thing that the uh help us  understand no there's no understanding here's um here's the next clip scientology is the authority  on everything they can also cure criminals we are the authorities on getting people off drugs we are  the authorities on the mind we are the authorities on improving conditions criminon we can rehabilitate 
[01:55:30]  criminals way to happiness we can bring peace uh and unite cultures uh  that once you know these tools and you know that they work it's it's not good enough that i'm just  doing okay traveling the world and meeting the people that i that i've met you know talking with  these leaders in various fields 
[01:56:00]  they want help and they are depending on people who know and who can be effective and do it and that's  just a pompous jerk off he sounds like a pompous jerk off he's not saying anything especially when  it's it's almost like this we are the ones who can do this um it's like well there are 12-step programs 
[01:56:30]  you dummy who have been helping people uh free of charge for many years no dues or fees stop it  i'm not saying scientology can't help with addictions maybe you can i think anything can for somebody you  know it's it's a goofy thing enough people are are into it where it has some legitimacy but it just  seems a little wacky i just don't like them they seem so arrogant yeah you're not these geniuses that 
[01:57:00]  are saving the rest of the sheep they think they are and isn't it more of a cult i don't know because  it's very exclusive they don't want too many members i i a second video game you got to level  up right you like start off at this lower level and then as you get rid of these um thetans uh they  they hook you up to a machine and they they're able to test how many you still have in you and you go up  to these levels and the higher your levels go uh it is said that the more money you contribute uh the 
[01:57:30]  the higher your level will go so this isn't a religion for poor people no suing everybody  that's good lovely lovely group say something they don't like they throw they drag in a court  yeah that's good their whole power base is that they is that they can't be a joke you know so if  people start joking about and making fun of them uh they they're gonna lose their power base do they  understand how south park humiliated oh one of the best episodes ever brilliantly yeah smash their 
[01:58:00]  faces and everybody knew what was being said and everybody laughed at them that heard it  are we are we mocked you are we allowed to say scientology or should we just call it call it the  big religion the big religion the pompous religion uh tom talks about having to do it do it in quotes  here do it whatever it is and then it's written here i have no idea what he's talking about 
[01:58:30]  look i wish the world was a different place i'd like to go on vacation and go and romp and  play and just do that you know what i mean i mean  that's what i want it to be okay that's how i would you know there's times i'd like to do that but  but i can't because i know 
[01:59:00]  i know  so  okay you know what you know you just you i yeah i have to do something about it it's not  you know you can sit here and wish it was different and then you look at it and you go  okay this is it all right okay and there's that moment where you go  you know i have to do something don't i yeah i really have to do it because i can't live with 
[01:59:30]  myself if i don't and it's and that really is it i don't care if someone thinks it's hard or easy  because you're either helping and contributing everything you can or you're not  i don't know why that's god you know what it's like the bob kelly in there the man's work is never 
[02:00:00]  done it's gonna be hard to carry such a burden i mean he wants to go on vacation tom doesn't have  time he can't too busy helping he has time to live in an amazing mansion in beverly hills though  he's helping hope he's i mean sure i mean making movies like mission possible three is helping  that's helping people let's say hi to john in kentucky john hitter jan hey how's it going guys i'm 
[02:00:30]  the guy who accidentally groped his father-in-law when we were talking about embarrassing stories  oh yeah what's up jimmy yeah not much jimmy i gotta thank you you're the first person who ever  made my mother-in-law shut up and walk out of the room with your hbo special thank you for god  you're welcome i'm glad she didn't like it the old bag thank you sir oh it was fantastic me and my boys  were rolling on the ground good thank you i work for the church of scientology i'll not say where just  in case they come after us hey uh first thing they teach you there must be fair and even exchange 
[02:01:00]  on everything it's all about the cash to get your bridge is what they uh they call their clear it costs  250 grand really it's all cash and they won't let you talk to other people that's how they control you  you can't talk to other people because it'll blow your bridge and you won't be able to be cleared and  what is what they call yeah wow you know we could discuss scientology for three hours and i'll still 
[02:01:30]  be completely confused dumbfounded it's made up science fiction story but it's made up too recently  to be um taken as a serious religion by a lot of people you know it's got you gotta have made up  stories from a long time ago from ye olden times right like jesus there's an alien frozen in a  volcano in the earth yeah yeah there's an alien frozen in a volcano they think that  yeah what's the matter with you jimmy of course crazy all right sir uh thanks buddy yeah i just uh 
[02:02:00]  if they don't want to be mocked because people really do look at them like like a cult and like  ugh like that's people's reaction ugh yeah i'm a sciento oh are you are you yeah why don't people  explain themselves why don't you explain scientology a little more uh and i mean tom cruise look i like  him as an actor but he's not the best spokesman he's comes off as extraordinarily condescending 
[02:02:30]  and pompous matt lauer is yeah shoot him up in that interview it was great he was being glib  very very smug very i'm informed and you're not and it's like hey pal the rest of us aren't sheep  yeah you haven't spent your life studying brilliant things your job is to say things that other people  have written and look handsome and you do both very that's what he does but without a script when  he's just babbling like that wow nothing let's say hi to anthony in jersey i'm trying to find some 
[02:03:00]  excerpts from the um the morton book that we got him coming in tomorrow andrew morton's book uh on  tom cruise go ahead anthony hey guys how you doing today good i um i just watched literally  last night a dvd it's called an introduction to scientology by l ron hubbard l ron hubbard it's  the only interview he gave and he made no sense i got done watching it's supposed to answer all the  questions of what scientology is i had no freaking clue what the hell he said except it raises your iq 
[02:03:30]  and that's it and the way they talk i'm like questioning that raises your iq i've never heard  a person like when scientology when the dianetics i mean there's a lot of good advice i think or good  basic advice in there but i've never heard a person who i think is intelligent explaining  scientology or making me go all right that makes some kind of sense right it really seems like it's  uh inspiring i don't know how they suck these people in i think people are dumb uh well we all want a  little that hope and a little that faith so is that what it is i think it's kind of easy actually 
[02:04:00]  uh andrew morton coming in tomorrow talking about his tom cruise book page 278 allegedly katie signed  a scientology contract that fundamentally fundamentally changed her human rights and those of her future  children requiring that if she or any of her children were ever to suffer from mental or terminal  illness they must turn only to scientology's treatments she must never use psychiatric care or  psychiatric drugs morton goes on to repeat the sketchy tabloid rumors that tom bought a fetus 
[02:04:30]  learning system that was strapped to katie's stomach and that he fitted katie's cell phone with a tracking  device so that he would know where she was day and night uh without naming his sources morton  this is some of the stuff hopefully we'll get to tomorrow spins the following yarn some scientology  sect members uh sincerely believed that katie holmes was carrying the baby do you got any uh 
[02:05:00]  austin power sound effects over there that katie holmes oh damn it yeah yeah um was was carrying the  baby the baby who would be the vessel for l ron hubbard's spirit so wait what what when he returned  from his trip around the galaxy  wow true believers were convinced that tom's spawn would be the reincarnation of l ron hubbard 
[02:05:30]  god they so badly want a christ uh some fanatics even wondered if the actress had been impregnated  with hubbard's frozen sperm  jesus christ diane sawyer fraudulent journalist that she is no one brought this crap up and did i guess  she had to sign something saying if you interview her but not one real question we just want to hear 
[02:06:00]  about her dumb movie yeah are you out of your mind go to tmz they did a whole thing on what jimmy's  explaining uh tmz did a montage of katie holmes uh interviews over the last few days including  letterman diane sawyer and a few other places and they they mocked the fact that none of these people  were brave enough to ask one scientology question like i like letterman but he went after paris  hilton for going to jail and it was funny it really was why wouldn't you at least address this you don't 
[02:06:30]  have to attack her for a religion but at least address what is in the news it's all over the place  they probably had to sign something she's not coming on your show if you agree to not if you  agree to not you know mention scientology why that's the that's the they're starting to write  these contracts for for these uh interviews why do people want them none of them are interesting  right uh okay uh hubbard's frozen sperm how'd katie feel about all this morton puts his intuitive powers  to the test to produce this gem katie might have felt as if she were in the middle of a real life 
[02:07:00]  version of the horror movie rosemary's baby  what are you doing  this is the one under good thing it wasn't this one  in which an un well we know what rosemary berry right of course which an unsuspected young woman  is impregnated with the devil's child you want to learn about thetans yeah what are the thetans 
[02:07:30]  uh operating thetans script writers scientology over him acting when tom uh the most poor require is  uh okay uh when tom accepted an invitation to the scientology gold base in the california desert a  secret uh location by the way of course uh head honcho david blah blah allegedly announced to his staff  the most important recruit ever is in the process of being secured his arrival will change the face of 
[02:08:00]  scientology forever wow  yep just like judaism and catholicism that is something here's more uh tom crow's running out of  show here talking about scientology okay uh because i'm carrying my load all right and only that  really much as i'm carrying i still feel like i gotta do more all right there's still a thing of  let's go you can just see the look in their eyes you know the ones that are doing you know and you 
[02:08:30]  know the spectators who are the ones that are going well it's easy for you or what am i doing and it's  just that thing is uh i've canceled that in my area it's like man you're either in or you're out  that's spectatorism and it's something that that is we have no time for it now spectatorism no it's our  responsibility to educate create the new reality you know we have that responsibility to say hey  this is the way it should be done because we do it this way and people are actually getting better 
[02:09:00]  and let's get it done you know let's really get it done and have enough love compassion and toughness  that you're gonna do it uh uh do it right he's so important to the world revolting thank god for  tom cruise just sounds like you know he reminds me of he sounds to me like a dumb jock trying to 
[02:09:30]  sound smart and and gentle dude you just gotta go out there and help shut your mouth yeah you're not  you're not this bastion of beauty in an ugly place two more excerpts that was the right word  two more excerpts from uh close enough yeah andrew morton's book the cliff notes by the way  uh roland sent this to me and i greatly appreciate it uh and we're gonna have him on tomorrow  andrew morton hey it's just gotta go hey morton says tom progressed uh to what scientologists call 
[02:10:00]  the wall of fire or operating theton level three level three level wow where the secrets of the  universe according to hubbard are revealed oh allegedly tom found the knowledge he had just  received disturbing and alarming as he struggled to uh reconcile the creationist myth with the more  practical teachings contained in the lower levels of scientology the lower levels you got to get to the 
[02:10:30]  top top the top of the pyramid there's no passing in scientology either gotta answer everything  right it was recalled that around this time relations between uh became ugly between david the the big  guy over there and the hollywood actor tom complaining that he had studied all these years and the whole  faith was about space aliens space aliens so he was like what the f am i doing however tom's disenchantment 
[02:11:00]  didn't last long morton writes that by 2004 tom reached the exalted level of operating theton level  level what seven wow that's great how do you do that that's a tough one expansion act  i think you'll never get to six how do you do that expansion pack expansion pack uh where a hubbard 
[02:11:30]  promised that man would become what what if this says immortal i'm smashing my own teeth his own  god dark smashing jimmy norton his own god  that stupid yodeling thing  yes his own god what's level i know we gotta wrap up what is it we'll finish when we're ready yeah you 
[02:12:00]  tell him hope what's level seven like according to former scientologist peter alexander you believe  that all your problems are due to these thetans thetans so when you come back into reality you're  like wow this is a nice day my dog's been killed but that doesn't matter i realize that i am a being  who has lived endlessly contacting all those long lost body thetans so nothing is really a problem 
[02:12:30]  that's great well they just trying to take the piece of buddhism and mix it in with uh something  flashy with aliens with space aliens with a science fiction book at space invaders yeah it's all those  yeah all right the final clip it's quick and then we'll get out of here everyone's panicking around  here uh this is the last thing from tom cruise talking about scientology tom thinks about all the  people that are depending on long pause almost says me but then says us oh thank god i want to know  that i've done everything i could uh every day and i think about those people out there who are 
[02:13:00]  depending on us and uh i think about that and it does make me feel uh like man there's you know we  got more work i need more help you know get those spectators either in the playing field or out of the  arena you know really then who's watching yeah what do you what do you think you're the only one 
[02:13:30]  doing something stupid on the playing field or out of the arena there's no audience there this  everyone's playing then the game is stupid is he talking about the big game i thought about the big  game i'm getting in trouble it's more dumb jock talk you gotta use arena and spectator now shut up  so we obviously i'm on the phone let's go to charlie in jersey he sums it up uh what did you learn on  the opian anthony show charlie i learned absolutely nothing about science that's all i need from you

[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  This is part of the gay clan.  This is going to make my headphones louder so I can hear through my winter hair. 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to shave my sick beard, I think.  You're shaving your sick beard?  You grew it during your illness?  Yeah, for two weeks.  Starting to pull at it.  Yeah.  I wanted to go really long.  Is it itching?  I want to look like a real creep, I decided.  I want to look like a real creep, I decided.  You want to look like a creep?  Are you implying that people that grow long beards look like creeps?  Yeah.  No, it gets to a point where people start looking at you like, when are you going to trim that thing? 
[02:19:00]  There's a reason he's doing that.  He's giving up.  Yeah, what's up?  He's giving up.  I'll ask my yogi and see what she suggests.  You're getting a female yogi?  Going to get a female yogi.  I'm not getting a yogi.  A spiritual leader slash therapist slash personal trainer, and I'm going to sip yogi tea.  What is that?  What?  Just throwing that out there, because people think I'm goofy.  You think there's yogi tea?  I'm already researching the yogi thing. 
[02:19:30]  Why do you have to go so out there?  Why can't you just get a therapist?  We'll pay for it.  Because sometimes you've got to travel long distances to realize the problem is right in front of you.  That's like...  Thank you.  Dorothy.  Name the book, I'll give you a prize.  The Wizard of Oz.  What?  I don't know.  She says sometimes you, you know, you don't have to leave your own backyard or something like that. 
[02:20:00]  Sometimes you've got to travel long distances to know the problem is right in front of you.  Or maybe not the problem.  Well, maybe I kind of adjusted that a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's like the old...  The answer is right in front of you.  How about that?  But what's a yogi going to do?  What does a yogi do?  I don't want to tell you that stuff.  You can't tell me what a yogi...  What is it?  Scientology?  I'll tell you what a yogi does.  I don't want other people to know, like, the secrets of the yogi.  They lay it on your stomach. 
[02:20:30]  Ooh.  Nude.  Ooh.  They grab your ball bag, and they pull it back between your legs, and they pull it up to your shoulders,  and they say, look at your cape, and you have to reach up and hold it and make flying sounds.  Ow!  Then I'm going to be reading...  It hurts.  ...special publications.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of publications?  It's top secret.  I don't think yogis are secretive.  The one I'm going to, you know, have is going to be, yes, top secret. 
[02:21:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how is this supposed to help you?  In what ways?  It's going to be therapy.  It's going to be a workout, and it's going to be some spirituality.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  As I drink my yogi tea.  Yogi tea.  And shave my head.  Shave my head.  That's all I'm saying right now. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  We'll look forward to that.  Jesus.  Lost his mind.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit every day.  A little bit.  A little bit.  So Diane Keaton cursed on GMA, and you're thinking, deja vu.  No.  No.  This is XM.  So we can play it unencumbered by regulation.  That's right.  All right.  I have to ask you about something.  I mean, I love them. 
[02:22:00]  I'd like to have lips like that.  Don't mind me.  All right.  I have to ask you about something.  Yogi.  I mean, I love them.  I'd like to have lips like that.  Then I wouldn't have worked on my fucking personality.  Or my, excuse me, my personality.  If I had lips like yours, I'd be better off.  Also a crime.  My life would be better.  I'd be married.  And I would have to send little skinny lips.  What am I going to do?  My mother's going to work on your personality with soap in your mouth. 
[02:22:30]  That's what she's going to do.  Soap in her mouth.  I know.  Excuse me.  How about the FCC working on a personality with a $340,000 fine?  You're right.  Right.  Jesus.  You know what, though?  The headline here is very simple.  Let's take the power away from fuck and fucking.  Yeah.  Everyone says it.  Just allow it on TV.  I don't think there's a person alive that doesn't hear that fucking word once a day.  What of the children?  What about them? 
[02:23:00]  It's always about the children.  They bring up the children and say the children can't hear it.  What's going to happen if they hear fuck?  Then they'll start using it.  You throw fuck all over TV, the power goes away.  Yeah.  That's the problem with the N-word thing.  You know, that word has unbelievable power now.  Yeah.  If you just ignore it, it doesn't have power.  Then again, when it was really...  That's what my yogi taught me.  When it was really...  If you don't...  Empower.  Acknowledge it!  It will just go away! 
[02:23:30]  Thank you.  That's my yogi lesson for today.  I have to disagree because when the word nigger was being used...  You know, we're saying the N-word on XM.  It's fucking ludicrous.  Yeah.  When that word was being used in a place where it was totally acceptable...  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It was kind of...  You know what I mean?  It was like...  Yeah.  It had power and it had meaning and it was bad then.  Yeah.  Like...  It was a lot worse then than it is now. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  But the word fuck...  Fuck's different.  I don't know.  I don't want that word just being thrown around willy-nilly.  But it is being thrown around.  And becoming like...  But everyone throws it around.  Yeah, but it's still kind of fun to use.  I don't want it to become like the word the...  So you want it to have that sting.  Yeah, it's got a little impact.  Yeah, all right.  I see it that way.  Fucker.  You know.  I see it that way.  Do you ever refer to your cock as a fuck stick?  Um, no.  No, Jimmy.  No. 
[02:24:30]  No.  No.  No.  Do you to, like, girls?  Girlfriends?  Yeah.  Say, take my fuck stick.  My entire fuck stick.  Use it in a sentence, Jimmy.  Give us a good example of how you use that in a sentence.  Here's some fuck stick for you.  I don't think that...  And what does that do to girls?  To get real wet and crazy.  Cool.  Yeah, I yell that at them.  While I'm inside. 
[02:25:00]  They're pounding.  Get her done!  Get her done!  It's always nice to be welcome.  Oh, hey, what's up?  Larry the Cable Guy.  Larry, what's up?  This is Larry.  Or is it?  Huh?  Is it?  You ain't gonna believe what just happened to me.  What happened?  Well, I'm on my way.  Honest to God, I'm on my way to a funeral.  Yeah.  And I'm driving down the road.  My grandpa passed away.  He got a prostitute.  And when it was done, he went to light a cigarette and his oxygen tank exploded.  So I'm on the way down to his house for the funeral. 
[02:25:30]  But, uh, I'm driving down the road about 80.  I get, I get backsided by some dude in a damn Mustang.  And believe it or not, I mean, he hammered me in my car.  I'm like, oh, shit.  I pull off to the side and some old man comes up, listen, I ain't got no phones.  I ain't got none.  We got no fault insurance.  And it doesn't look like you got a lot of damage.  And believe it or not, all I got is a couple of little rubs on the back of my car. 
[02:26:00]  And he slammed into me.  I don't get it.  But, uh, that just happened.  Just now I'm pulled off on the side of the road here on the interstate.  Oh.  Oh, it really happened.  Oh, I thought you were setting up a bit.  Jesus.  Are you okay, Larry?  I'm sitting there going, all right.  And the punchline is?  No, that just now happened.  It's unbelievable.  So you got rear-ended, did you?  I got rear-ended, my friends.  Wow.  So what do you got to wait?  Let me, since you're speaking up rear-ended, let me ask you something. 
[02:26:30]  In a gay relationship, who gets the remote?  Um, that's a three in the forest question right there, son.  No, I'll tell you who I think I figured that out.  Yeah?  Whoever's not in the bathroom wiping blood off the back of their legs.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  You know what?  That's why I called to Jim Norton.  Hello, man.  Did y'all have a good Christmas?  Uh, yeah, Christmas was all right.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  It is what it is.  I got so irritated, everybody would say, have a good holiday.  You know, it's Christmas.  You know, the Christmas.  The Christian believers only get three holidays a year.  You know, we get Christmas, Easter, and the Daytona 500.  Right.  So it's like, let us have Christmas.  But I had a nice time.  Uh, I took my little boy Christmas shopping, and he was wearing a camouflage onesie, and  I lost him in the Christmas tree section for 20 minutes.  Oh, my God.  It was embarrassing. 
[02:27:30]  Me and the manager had to walk around Walmart looking for a two-foot-tall pine tree that smelled  like crap.  Now, have you ever seen Miracle on 34th Street?  Of course.  Of course.  It's a classic.  Dude, I saw that for the first time.  My dad would never let me watch it.  He always thought it was about getting a prostitute to take a check.  Miracle on 34th Street.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  This is, these are the Christmas bits. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  They have a holiday theme to them.  I only got, I only got another week to use them.  I got, I'm going to use them.  Now, my brother, I always like buying really good creative gifts, because I get sick and  tired of getting those, uh, those Pepperidge Farm gifts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What's a Pepperidge Farm gift?  I don't want to throw you off your bit, but.  Well, nobody, that's when you really don't know what to get somebody and just go to the  mall and they got, you know, Pepperidge Farms, they got all the meat and the cheeses, you 
[02:28:30]  know.  Okay, sure.  Hey, Merry Christmas.  We love you.  Here's some bologna.  It's like, what the hell?  But I was real ingenuity this year.  My brother's into rough sex and he's single.  I mean, he's a, he's a rough case.  I mean, a girl could get pregnant just sitting on his sheets.  All right.  Nice.  But I bought him a blow up doll with a patch kit and he already had an accident and he  was making love to it and he got it too close to the candle and her butthole melded to his 
[02:29:00]  eyeglasses.  Can you believe that?  It's like, you got me so good with this setup on that Mustang thing.  Everything.  I'm such a gullible idiot.  I'm like, all right, well, is this real or is this?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm grabbing around with the wrong thing.  Dude, it's been a hell of a trip.  I had a dump truck pull out in front of me at about 85.  I had to slam on my brakes.  Now I got some jackass in the Mustang freaking whack.  And he's back there right now looking at this tire. 
[02:29:30]  I think he screwed his tire up, but it didn't do much to my vehicle.  Are you guys like, are you guys now doing something that Anthony hates?  Are you guys blocking traffic or are you off to the side of the road?  Well, I'm off to the side of the road.  I ain't a traffic blocker.  Why are you driving, Larry?  You should be on a bus somewhere.  Why are you driving to gigs?  Well, you know, I live the same.  It ain't a gig.  It's a funeral.  Oh, dude, you did say that.  Wait, so the funeral's real too?  Yeah, that's real.  That's real?  Oh, yeah, I'm going to a funeral.  You know, the guy that started the Comedy Corner in West Palm Beach where a lot of comedians 
[02:30:00]  got their start, he passed away.  Okay.  He was 54.  I just felt I should go to the funeral.  So I'm on my way to the funeral.  No, but I got to tell you, you know, I might turn around and hit home these drivers out  here.  Did the guy that hit you know who you were?  No, he had no clue.  I got sunglasses on and I'm wearing sleeves.  I'm wearing sleeves.  They got no clue who I am.  That's all you got to do.  Hey, would the guy die at 54? 
[02:30:30]  He's kind of young.  Yeah, it'd bring to him.  Oh, wow.  Jeez.  So I never heard, I've worked in West Palm, but I've never actually done that gig.  Does the gig still exist?  No, you know what?  It's not there anymore.  They got an improv down there now, but it used to be one of the top five clubs in the  country.  I mean, everybody come through there.  I mean, I saw, shoot, Leno, Seinfeld, they all come through the Comedy Corner at some point.  Yeah, I think I'd heard of it.  I started, what did you start, 85?  I started like 1990 and I think I'd heard the name before, but I never did the gig. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, it was a real good club.  So I'm headed down there to do that if I make it.  Good Lord.  How far do you have to drive?  Oh, I'm about 47 minutes out.  He's just way to estimate, Larry.  That's me.  I'm good at the estimation.  Accurate estimate.  That's very precise.  Yeah, a little less than an hour would have thought.  That's what I used to tour as, Larry the estimation guy.  I wouldn't get no footing on that one, so I changed.  No footing. 
[02:31:30]  Most people would say 45 minutes, but you know, exactly.  47.  I had a hooker one time.  This is absolutely true.  She was an awful German woman and she was jerking me off and she was mad that I kept groping  for her nipple and trying to see how big her twat lips were.  And she looked at the clock and she's like, we have four minutes left.  I'm like, could you have said five or we have a couple, but you know.  Four minutes.  How exact is that, you fucking.  She's counting the seconds in her head, that means.  She has your fucking, that's why. 
[02:32:00]  Four minutes.  Yeah, four minutes left.  Jesus, baby.  What'd you get done in four minutes, Jimmy?  Anything good?  No, I actually didn't finish.  That's the truth.  You just said, fuck this?  Yeah, and I dismissed her.  And she thought she wasn't going to get paid, but I paid her.  Well, I tell you what, I'm getting, I got to go see a doctor or something.  My memories, I was having sex with my wife the other day and we was two minutes in and  I thought, now why did I come in here?  Believe me, but no, I'm driving back after you. 
[02:32:30]  It's supposed to rain up in Sanford where I live, which is a real weather coincidence  because it looks like my wife and Sanford are going to get three inches by five o'clock.  Hey, dude, you've been married for how many years?  I've been married for two and a half years.  Oh, so you got married after you were like already, I almost said a big sensation and  then I realized I'm at 65.  So you got married after you were like really famous.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I got married right when I hit. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, I'll tell you what, I'm glad I did too because there's some, I'd be getting in some  trouble if I wasn't married.  You think so?  You call that trouble?  Oh, here comes this jackass up to my window.  Please let us hear what he says.  Yeah, we got to hear this.  Hold on, yeah, hold on, listen to this.  Yes, sir.  You sure you're all right?  Oh, yeah, I'm good.  Well, I can understand that.  Maybe he's listening to the radio show.  I'm fine.  I'm good.  You sure?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Okay.  You all right?  Is there anything I can do for you?  No, don't worry about it. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  Ask him for a blowjob.  Ask him for a blowjob.  No, I ain't talking to the police.  I'm talking to the highway patrol.  You're not talking to the highway.  I got, like, a dead body in the trunk.  No, I'm good.  Seriously.  I ain't talking to the patrol.  I'm good.  I'm talking to opening an answer.  All right.  I had to disconnect my, uh, my, uh, electrical into my, uh, what do you call it?  No one cares.  Oh, who, why would Larry the cable guy care?  I appreciate it.  All right.  Okay, I'll see you later.  Don't worry about it.  You go, don't worry about it. 
[02:34:00]  You're good.  See how nice I am.  Yeah, that guy says he's an asshole.  Tell him your neck hurts, and he has to wait there for the cops.  I had to disconnect my electrical system.  Who cares?  Yeah, hold on.  Let me tell him that.  You son of a bitch, I hurt my neck!  Well, that guy's crazy.  He ain't wearing any pants.  That's funny.  He has no idea.  He just fucking rear-ended one of the biggest comics in the country.  Yeah.  He's probably a fan. 
[02:34:30]  He's probably a guy that's heard your stuff and likes your stuff, and has no idea that  he almost killed you.  He's probably in a Mustang, an old Mustang.  The front of it's all primer, and the back of it's brand new.  Evidently, he did something before.  Yeah, yeah.  See how that happens.  Hey, do you guys still have...  I don't really watch comedy such as much, man.  You guys still have your show on, right?  You know what?  I think they play it in repeats on Thursday in the afternoons, I believe.  I'm not sure, but I think they do.  Are you going to do new episodes, or no?  No, we're done with Blue Calls. 
[02:35:00]  You know what?  We're all doing different things now.  You know, Foxworthy's got the smarter than a fifth grader, which I'm not going on,  because I got put back so many times, I ended up driving the rest of the fifth  grade to school.  Oh, by the way, I went out there and watched him do that one time, and them kids,  what a bunch of assholes.  This one kid goes, did you get any right?  I said, no.  He goes, ha-ha, I'm smarter than you.  I'm like, well, I may not be smarter than a fifth grader, but I'm beating the shit  out of one of them. 
[02:35:30]  But he's doing that, and Engvall's got a show on TBS, and I've been doing some movies,  so I got my movie, Witness Protection, coming out February 22nd.  Okay.  Wait, you left off with...  I'm sorry, Gary.  That's with Jenny McCarthy, and Ivana Milichevich, and Eric Roberts, and Yafet Kodo, and Peter  Stamart.  Wow.  Hey, you got a cast there.  Yafet Kodo.  And Joe Montani.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, yeah, Joe Montani.  I thought he meant the football player.  Not the quarterback.  Right, right. 
[02:36:00]  I like Joe.  You ever see House of Games with Joe Montani?  You know what?  I did see that.  The gambling game.  Yeah.  What's that about?  You sick bitch!  He plays a con man, and JT Walsh is in it, and this really...  Oh, he was great.  This woman kind of gets interested in it, and so she goes to learn the con game.  She's an author, and it's really like fucking real mammoth-type dialogue, like back and forth.  It's really...  It's a great movie, right?  Oh, yeah.  I liked it.  My wife and I watched it, so yeah, it was real good. 
[02:36:30]  Who did you leave off, Larry?  It's you, it's Foxworthy, Bill Engvall.  Is there someone else on Blue Collar?  Oh, Ron White.  What's that Ron doing?  Yeah, Ron wasn't on Blue Collar.  He had another project.  He was trying to do his own show, but Ron's just touring, and I think he's doing some guest  stuff on an HBO show that's coming out, so...  Why didn't he do the show with you guys?  He had another show that he thought was going to be...  Yeah, he was trying to do another show, so he didn't, but...  Or they didn't want to split it up five ways.  Yep.  Well, that's basically what it was. 
[02:37:00]  But yeah, he's doing his own stuff, just basically touring.  Would you guys ever tour together again?  Because with all the success, to have like you four go out on the road again, if you all  had like a different hour or something, I mean, you really would.  I mean, you could probably do a giant stadium.  You know what?  I wouldn't count it out.  I guarantee you, when our balls are hitting the floor, we're going to be out there in  Vegas probably doing something together.  I wouldn't be too surprised.  Very good.  All right.  What's the biggest venue you guys did together? 
[02:37:30]  The biggest one we did together is still an all-time record.  We did the Gaylord Center in Nashville, Tennessee.  And the biggest show they ever did, well, it might have been Broken Now by Miley Cyrus.  But the biggest show by Hannah Montana, but the biggest show they had at the time was  Elton John and what's his name?  You know, they toured together, Elton John and...  Billy Joel.  Billy Joel, probably?  Billy Joel.  Yeah.  And I think they did like 19,000.  We did a little over... 
[02:38:00]  We did almost 21,000.  Jesus, for stand-up.  Wow.  Yeah, that was insane.  That was the biggest show by far.  But that Hannah Montana, I think she did two sell-outs there, so I think she did 21 and  a half each tonight, so...  Well, you're promoting this Friday and Saturday, Larry.  Is it wrong to want to bang her?  She's good-looking.  Not at all.  Not at all.  I hope not.  Is it wrong that I think that she's passed her prime?  I'm telling you, she looks like she's...  Where I'm looking, she could be 25. 
[02:38:30]  Of course.  This Friday and Saturday...  You know what?  That's the thing about her.  You'd go to put a rubber on and accidentally put on a Chinese finger trap or something.  You know?  Still got them kid toys lying around.  Try getting that off.  Yeah, that was a tough...  I'm trying to get you...  Yeah, I'm going to be...  I'm at...  Where am I?  I'm at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, May 2nd, at 8 o'clock. 
[02:39:00]  Very good.  That's in Nassau, New York.  Yes, sir.  It sure is up in Uniondale.  All right, so it's Nassau Coliseum, and it is...  I guess Ticketmaster's where all your stuff is, right?  Yeah, you can get everything at Ticketmaster.  You know, my brother used to work at Ticketmaster, and he quit, and they charged him a 50%.  You don't are quitting for you.  Hey, this Friday and Saturday, do you still have tickets available in Nashville?  You know what?  I believe maybe a few for the second show on Saturday, but they're calling it sold out, 
[02:39:30]  but I'm sure you can finagle some.  All right, so it's at Jackson Hole if you happen to be in Nashville.  And you can go to LarryTheCableGuy.com for all his tour dates.  Yes, but May what?  May 8th.  May 2nd.  May 2nd.  Now, here in New York, Nassau Coliseum.  Out there on Long Island.  Larry is still doing fucking arenas, man.  It's amazing.  Hey, Larry, what do you think of Britney Spears?  Good Lord, I'll tell you what. 
[02:40:00]  She's a mess, that's for sure.  I know why she had that second kid, though.  She needed something soft to land on for the first one.  I'd bang her.  Yeah, I would, too.  Yeah, but you know, in the paper today, an eyewitness report, some clothing store,  she came out of the changing room all naked and stuff, and everyone was horrified,  because they saw acne and cold sores all over her face.  Ooh.  Well, I'd bang her. 
[02:40:30]  Sticking to his story.  When she did that comeback, everybody was like, look how fat Britney is.  Meanwhile, about 90% of the guys are sitting at home going, oh, boy, what'd I do to her?  Yeah, I thought she looked kind of good.  I like that little bit of a dirty chub.  She was still fuckable.  Yeah.  You know, the poundage made her, you know, obtainable to a lot of guys.  They're like, wow, you know what?  I legitimately got a shot now.  Oh, heck yeah.  There's fat guys all over the country writing letters.  That paparazzi guy that's hanging with her, he's got one goal in mind, to get her fucking 
[02:41:00]  pregnant.  That's all he wants to accomplish with this whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And she will have the kid, and this guy will be set for life.  That's his whole thing with this thing.  He's not looking for a relationship.  He's seeing an ATM machine right there.  The gold mine.  Yeah, she's a fucking ATM machine.  Yeah.  That's all you have to do.  Your dick is the card.  That is the game that is being played right now.  You know, if you're looking for fame and money, just get her pregnant.  That's all you need to do.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he's out for. 
[02:41:30]  No doubt about it.  You don't have to whine and dine her and all that romance crap.  You just throw some seed in her, and you're set for life.  And that's what that guy's thinking.  I'm actually mailing her little baggies in my sperm, and I'm saying, magic elixir, squeeze  into pussy and wait.  Long way to walk for an awful joke.  Hold on.  I'm writing that down.  Are you still on the side of the road?  No.  You know what?  I had to get back on.  So now I'm back on the road right in the middle of two dump trucks.  Pray for me.  All right, Larry. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Well, listen, man.  We're sorry to hear you're going to a funeral.  And let us know when you're coming up here.  It would be great to see you again in person.  Hey, you got it, guys.  I appreciate you always having me on.  You guys are great.  And, Jimmy, it's nice talking to you, too.  Thank you, Larry.  I'll see you soon, buddy.  All right, guys.  Get in.  Take care to Larry.  Thanks, Larry.  Larry the cable guy, everyone.  All right.  He's got to throw his catchphrase in.  Yeah.  He kind of does it sarcastically at the end.  I like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Get it done.  That guy was young to die.  54 years old, man.  That's fucking.  That's awful.  You got a brain to him, man. 
[02:42:30]  That's a motherfucker.  All right.  We got to deal with something after the break.  This Corey guy we talked to yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  It's starting to look like he was a fraud.  We got pwned.  Actually, they did it to a lot of people.  It's a very interesting story.  We got our interview with this kid cut up.  We'll play it.  And we bought it.  We bought it.  We'll explain the whole thing for the newbies.  But we bought into it, and we'll explain.  Why wouldn't we?  And the real kid is up on child porn charges.  It's getting a little crazy.  I guarantee you someone videotaped with his cell phone and a girl who was 15. 
[02:43:00]  Some bullshit.  Yeah.  We'll get into it.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Larry the cable guy, and I'm a half-eared in Jim Neighbors with a wheelbarrow  full of that host.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and  you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv, and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping.  Just lay over one of them. 
[02:43:30]  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight-decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalingus.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck, like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton. 
[02:44:00]  Remember, I'm the safe.  Oh, my God.  Turn down the music.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  During the break, I was putting my headphones on, and I haven't done this in a while,  and they snapped back, hit me in the temple.  Saw stars.  Got a little nauseous.  You got nauseous?  I'm not kidding, because it hit me right in the temple.  It did crack you.  It snapped. 
[02:44:30]  I heard it go like it made a cracking sound.  Right there.  I heard it got a bump.  I'm starting to think I might need a rectal exam.  Linger!  Egg!  Egg!  Egg!  Linger lunger!  Egg!  Egg!  Ah, wow.  But that fucking hurt.  Anyway, we got a bit of a soap opera on our hands that we're part of.  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened? 
[02:45:00]  Your farts?  Is it the farts?  What's up, Dan?  We have 80 monitors around here, so I can put anything I'm looking at on any of the televisions.  So for the first time in, I don't know, six months, Jim thinks there's something really  important on my screen that he needs to check out.  I didn't mean it, but I broke wind and I accidentally trailed it over there, but I wanted to do it  accidentally.  Okay.  I wanted to see this money's face again.  I mean, I'm not happy when I smell a fart, but in general, I could deal with your crap, 
[02:45:30]  literally.  But today, man, wow.  I haven't had a day like this in a while.  You took me out of the game, big time.  They're methane farts, and it's because I'm taking, I just don't take Metamucil.  Which rules.  Yeah, I know, I know.  But I mean, I want to have healthy, I want to clean my body out, and apparently there's  been a lot of methane in there.  Methane?  I've been very insecure.  Dude, try the aloe water.  Is that what that doctor we know?  That's Aloise.  Oh.  This is an actual water.  Drink it.  Is it good?  And you get like globs in your water, though. 
[02:46:00]  That's the only thing.  Ugh.  You don't want that.  Kind of like globs.  Almost like you're swallowing egg yolks.  You don't taste it.  The water's flavored a little bit, but you're drinking water, and all of a sudden, kind of  like an egg yolk, egg white substance, all of a sudden.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Yeah.  It's like cum water.  Yeah.  Cum water.  It just slides down here.  But man, the logs are intact when they come out.  Jimmy's got the fucking atmosphere of Venus inside his intestines. 
[02:46:30]  It's just all gases and sulfur.  You're getting the hot air ones where you feel like the...  Is it going?  Your genes poof up a little bit.  They go like this.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  Like this.  Like this.  Like this.  It feels so good.  I wish me and my girlfriend weren't broken up.  I would really like to fucking share these with her.  You broke up?  I think so, yeah.  You think so? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Now that's...  Wait, this is like breaking news.  Well, I was kind of hitting to it.  Break up news.  Yeah, you are a hint.  Where's our breaking news sweeper?  Oh, we're not allowed to use it, remember?  Oh, yeah.  We stole it from Fox.  Oh, yeah.  Big hullabaloo.  Are you really done, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not...  I'm not even...  We're not even mad at each other.  I mean, I'm not mad at her.  I just think that we just keep missing each other.  I just don't know.  Have you guys discussed the cowboy situation from the other day?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We talked about it.  I mean, and she definitely understands kind of where I was coming from.  But, you know, she kind of understands like what I was mad at. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  She understood that night.  And it was like, we just miss each other.  That was the main thing.  Is she getting frustrated, too?  I think so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, she's the one who's more likely to go, look, why are we fighting like this?  I hate this.  If you guys break up, that's going to be sad.  Yeah, it will be.  I mean...  You guys seem pretty happy together.  A lot of times we are, you know?  How long have you been going out now?  That's about a little over a year.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  It's hard to say because we were friends for so long and just kind of melded into it in  a weird way.  It wasn't like this hate.  You guys were pretty new when we were in West Palm Beach, Florida, and that was like in early  December.  Yeah.  Do you think if you broke up, you'd still be friends?  Not at first.  Uh-huh.  It would be too hard.  Yeah.  Because I like her enough, but it would be too hard.  My biggest thing with a breakup is I don't want to think about them fucking somebody else.  Well, that's the usual thing.  Which is very natural.  But you can't stay because you're afraid of that.  So I don't want to stay because I'm afraid of that.  But then again, I do love her. 
[02:48:30]  And I would really...  I just don't know.  It's not a matter of do I like her enough.  I know I do.  But the fighting is just driving us both crazy.  Both of us.  It's not all her fault.  Are they ridiculous fights?  Like, I mean, like, do they go on and on?  And are they...  Is there a lot of yelling?  Is there just sarcastic barbs being thrown back and forth?  She'll pretty much take my cue in an argument in the sense that I'm the one who will push  the argument to whatever level it gets to.  She's better at fucking backing off. 
[02:49:00]  Like, I can't picture going to her, look, I really don't want to fight right now.  Let's just...  And I think she would always be like, okay, fine.  Like, let's just talk about it.  She's really good at that.  Any bad level the argument goes to, she'll match me.  Oh, okay.  But I have to say, I'm probably the one 80% of the time that pushes it from level two  to level three and so on.  What's the biggest cause of an argument with you two guys?  Her refusal to give up black dick.  Mm, okay.  Because that's...  Yeah, that...  That's the same thing she complained about with me. 
[02:49:30]  Can't you just look the other way?  No, it's too big.  No, it's nothing like...  It's nothing dramatic.  It's nothing about other people or any of that stuff.  It's just the biggest...  We're both, I think, very stubborn, and we both allow defects of our past to interfere  with who we are today.  Really?  Yeah, I think so, man.  There's no single issue you can say...  Like, a lot of people can say, well, here's money.  Money is a big problem in the relationship.  Or, you know, dividing up the housework. 
[02:50:00]  That's a big problem.  But is there any, like, one subject that just...  I think she feels very much like she's in my space a lot, and involved in my life, and  almost like she feels like a player in my life.  Like, my schedule is set, and I'm comfortable with my schedule being set, and she feels like  she always has to accommodate what I'm doing.  Right.  Which, to a certain extent, is, look, I have a set schedule, I can't help that.  Yep.  But I can understand why that would be annoying, where everything we do, pretty much, is based 
[02:50:30]  on Jim Norton, and Jim Norton's convenience, and Jim Norton's schedule.  It's almost like she probably feels like, what am I fucking...  That is a problem with this job.  It's very difficult, man.  It really is.  It's a problem with our relationship, with this job.  She'll say, baby, I get up at 5.15 in the morning, and she's understanding about that,  but a lot of times she'll want to just go out to eat at 10, which I want to do, too.  It's just, it's hard to have sex, because when do you have sex? 
[02:51:00]  It's like, you know, I mean, you can, but it's just, I don't know.  It's a fucking nightmare, man.  The schedule is very tough.  This job is very frustrating.  Does your chick stay up when you go to bed?  Like, Lindsay will go out and watch TV or something, or go on the computer when you're  in bed?  Yeah, or come to bed with me with her laptop.  It depends, but it's just...  Jimmy's right.  The whole thing is, after a while, a girl will kind of feel like she's just kind of putting  along with you.  Yes.  You know, you're kind of the guy. 
[02:51:30]  The important one.  The important one, yeah.  Yeah, and, you know, she feels like a bit player.  It's the downside of what we do.  It's frustrating.  There's times I want to go out and eat late or go to a movie, and so many sacrifices to  make sure you get to bed at a decent hour.  Well, it's also when we stay...  And there are times I am dead tired, and there's some exciting things happening in my personal  life, and I'm like, I just got to crash.  Yeah.  I can't even keep my eyes open. 
[02:52:00]  I know we got this thing going on.  It's very exciting, whatever.  And I'm like, I just got to sleep.  I'm sorry.  My body's shutting down.  And it's frustrating to me, too, because I'm like, I don't want to go to bed at nine because  I'm overly tired.  It sucks.  She, yeah, and it's almost like she lives with two roommates, and she wants me to spend  more time in her space.  She's like, it's weird, but we'll be sitting there, and you'll just start watching The Wire  or doing your taxes or whatever, because she's over all the time, and she's like, that's 
[02:52:30]  fine, but it's like, I kind of want that, too.  At times, just to be able to do something while you're in my place, but it's like, the difference  is you have two people living there.  I mean, I've lived in that situation.  It's like, we can't even argue at your place.  If I want to shit, I have to make sure that somebody else isn't using the...  It's just the simple logistics of not having other people there.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  I mean, it's...  Yeah, I mean, you got your own place, and you guys got, you know, privacy and stuff.  That's a big one for...  It's privacy.  It's not about liking, you know what I mean?  Not liking her place.  Walking around with, like, roommates and stuff when you don't have to.  Yeah.  I mean, we all did the roommate thing. 
[02:53:00]  I did it forever.  I mean, forever.  I don't want to have to deal with that anymore.  Yeah.  But I see her side of it, too, because she wants you in her space.  She doesn't want to feel like a bit player in my life.  Right.  Or, like, a fucking fangirl.  Right.  But she's certainly not.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I understand that.  Well, the solution to that, which you're obviously not going to do or ready to do, is, you know,  you got to get your place together.  And then it feels like hers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a solution to that, but that's a biggie.  That's a big step. 
[02:53:30]  But even that would probably be a problem, because the scheduling would always be mine.  It's almost like, I'd say that was a running theme in our fights, is that it's a frustration  she has, I think, with it all being about me.  And I certainly would probably feel frustrated, too.  Right.  You know, I mean, that would be annoying.  I have to fucking...  So where is it at, Jimmy?  Where is it at?  We talked yesterday, and she's like, look, we didn't...  She's like, I still think you're mad at me, or whatever.  And I'm like, no, I'm really not. 
[02:54:00]  I just don't know what we should do.  We were talking on the way home, and actually, we were fighting, and I wanted to punch the  windshield out.  I felt rage.  Oh, but I said that to her.  I'm like, I want to punch this windshield, and it kept me from doing it.  And over what?  Like, I want to punch the windshield over us arguing, over this discussion we're having.  Just the anger, the frustration, and feeling like I wasn't being heard.  Like, of when you're telling...  It's almost like I can't...  You two are pretty deep.  ...comprehend.  You two are pretty deep.  I can't comprehend how you don't understand what I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Like, I can't comprehend how I'm telling you why this bothered me, and you're giving me 
[02:54:30]  that shitty example of how it's a parallel.  Like, well, if I wanted to do that, it's like it's not the same thing.  Mm-hmm.  That's frustrating.  And when you feel like you're not being heard, that's the thing that bothers me the most.  Not that she's not agreeing.  Yeah, yeah.  With anybody.  If I feel like you're not getting why I'm mad at you, or what my objection is.  If I feel like I'm being heard and disagreed with, that's one thing.  I don't know.  Do you ever see it her way?  Yeah, usually not in the moment.  But this one, even in hindsight, I still see it my own way. 
[02:55:00]  I still feel.  But a lot of times, she said to me, we were fighting in a hotel, and she said, and I felt  that she was wrong to kind of start the argument with me that she did.  But I forget.  Like, she's like, do you know how hard it is to be around someone who's raging all the  time?  Do you know how frustrating that is?  And I'm like, yeah, I guess that is.  Like, I thought about that, like, ugh.  Like, yeah, that would probably fucking annoy me, too.  So, this was very recently she said that.  She's like, you're always raging about something.  It's hard to deal with.  That's gotten better, man. 
[02:55:30]  It has.  Way better.  I'm still seething.  You don't drive with me.  Oh, we're on the radio.  We're staying in hotels with me.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I'm...  I said, oops, we're on the radio.  I feel like I'm in your kitchen today.  Yeah, I know, right?  I was in Jimmy's kitchen yesterday just kind of discussing stuff.  But, yeah, no, it has.  I mean, it has.  No, it's gotten way better.  It's just...  You seem like a happier person in general.  Yeah, I don't know where it's going to wind up.  I mean, I'm certainly not like, fuck her, I don't want to be with her.  It's not about that.  No, I know that.  I just don't know, man.  All right.  Hate to move on, but I don't care. 
[02:56:00]  We'll go back to that, obviously.  It'll be a running theme.  This Corey guy, very, very interesting.  I guess we've got to explain.  If you weren't listening yesterday, we discovered this video.  I think a lot of you did.  It made it to break.com on the front page, YouTube.  And it's basically this kid.  He's 16 years old.  He threw a party.  He sent out an invite on his MySpace.  And he thought a few friends would show up.  500 people showed up.  His parents were out of town, obviously. 
[02:56:30]  16.  They're drinking and drugging, I'm assuming.  And it got out of hand.  Cops were called to kind of break up the party.  And then all hell broke loose.  And now the cops are suing the kid's parents.  So this kid went on the lam, basically.  He never went home.  He's kind of like a surfer dude.  He's got long, bleach blonde hair.  He's got whacked out large glasses.  One of those hats that has a lot of that graffiti all over it, kind of. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, kind of the crap on it.  And his big sunglasses and his shirt opened.  Yeah, then he had a hoodie on with that wide open, exposing his bare chest.  And a lot of people checked out the video of him talking to some news reporter down there  in Australia about the situation.  And we played that yesterday.  We got three clips.  It's worth playing again because we love this thing.  It's hilarious.  So this is what we played yesterday.  Why don't you take this opportunity now to apologize to your parents and to your neighbors 
[02:57:30]  who have said today that they were frightened?  Well, I've already offered to say sorry to them and stuff when I see them.  So I will say sorry now for everything that happened.  Why don't you take your glasses off so we can see you  and then apologize to your neighbors for frightening them?  Nah, I'll leave these on.  Nah, I like them.  I like them.  I like them.  And the reporter continued.  Take off those glasses and apologize to everybody that you frightened, 
[02:58:00]  to the police who were forced to retreat and whose cars have been damaged,  and to the community who have had to pay for this.  Take off your glasses and apologize to us.  I'll say sorry, but I'm not taking off my glasses.  Why not?  Because they're famous.  Because your glasses are famous.  Yeah.  Why are your glasses famous?  I know.  Everyone likes them, so I know I'm not taking them off. 
[02:58:30]  And then finally...  You're pretty happy with the way you look and the attitude you've got, are you?  Yeah.  My parents aren't, but I am.  Okay, Corey, we've got to wrap this up,  but what would you say to other kids who were thinking of partying  when their parents are out of town?  Get me to do it for you.  Get you to do it for you.  Not don't do it.  Don't.  Nah.  Get me to do it for you.  Best party ever so far.  That's what everyone's been saying, so...  Well, we've got to go,  but I suggest you go away and take a good, long, hard look at yourself. 
[02:59:00]  I have.  Everyone has.  They love it.  I have.  What a douche, right?  He's great, man.  He's great, though.  So we got so excited, we couldn't get enough of this kid,  and we had Steve hunt him down.  And we, quote, talked to him yesterday, supposedly.  There's a few updates today.  No surprise that Steve possibly got pwned.  Well, we all got pwned.  But Steve thinks everything is, what, real on the internet, so... 
[02:59:30]  Unless it's fake.  Then it's fake.  He believes in...  But I think it's real, so it's real.  We ask Steve all the time when we see something on the internet.  We go, Steve, is that real or fake?  And if he says fake, we absolutely know it's real.  Yeah.  And vice-y-versy.  Steve is a very easy...  Steve is a dope.  Scroll, scroll.  Scroll, scroll to the wrong person.  Hello, is this Australian? 
[03:00:00]  Is Corey there?  Is this Australian?  Who would you like me?  Corey, the man on the computer.  Corey, could you please connect me with him?  Oh, hello, this is Corey.  It's him.  It sounds...  He's got an accent.  Hi, do you have an XM?  Huh?  Okay, good.  Could you talk to Opie Anthony?  Obviously, it's time for a beating.  Yes.  It's Corey, I hear a diggeridoo. 
[03:00:30]  A diggeridoo.  All right.  Hey, uh...  So it says here you're a kangaroo lasso-er.  Hello, Australia.  That's great.  Yes, I'm trying to call a continent.  Yes, his name is Corey.  Do you have a last name?  No, but he's the guy from the news clip.  The news.  You've had to have seen it in Australia. 
[03:01:00]  He has delicious, delicious nipple rings and a smooth chest.  Like me.  I don't know why I'm here.  You guys are doing so well without me.  I know.  It's just more fun when you're in the room.  I don't know why.  We're getting to that point in this whole thing, but first of all, the update on the kid.  Child porn charges over MySpace party, they're not calling him Corey anymore because of the...  Than pointed out because of the porn charges.  Child porn charges.  You can't name names when they're underage. 
[03:01:30]  But now they don't...  Now they're not referring to him as Corey anymore.  Oh, really?  In the news stories.  A youth, they're calling him.  But you know who it is.  From yesterday, you do.  Today, they're just calling him a youth.  Hello, can I speak to a youth?  Yes.  Oh, wait, but maybe it wasn't Corey, though.  Maybe it was someone from his party.  It's another youth.  A youth faces child porn and other charges attending a wild party that left a trail of  damage.  After attending, yeah.  Attending, sorry, a wild party that left a trail of damages, terrorized neighbors, and 
[03:02:00]  caused an international storm.  Storm.  Two 16-year-olds face court over the infamous party.  One male has been charged with producing child pornography and creating a public nuisance.  He has been bailed to appear at a children's court next month.  The other is expected to be charged on summons to also appear.  Dozens of police, the dog squad, and a helicopter were forced to control a mob of 500 youths at  the unsupervised party over the weekend.  Booze-fueled partygoers allegedly damaged cars, destroyed gardens, and littered streets 
[03:02:30]  with empty alcohol containers.  The party, which was advertised on MySpace, has hit world headlines.  The fallout has reverberated across news bulletins, websites, and internet forms across the  globe.  People act like this is the L.A. riots.  Who gives a fuck?  Bunch of white kids running around a shitty fucking flat country.  Who gives a fuck?  So this is where we get dragged into the story.  We got the kid on the phone yesterday that threw the party. 
[03:03:00]  We just played his audio, obviously.  And now it looks like it wasn't the kid.  Right.  According to everyone.  Or at least according to everybody, yeah.  Oh, it's everybody now?  Well, no.  This does seem like it was a scam.  Definitely.  Yeah, it seems like here's exactly what happened.  The website that you guys plugged yesterday, like within 24 hours of the kid being on the  show is now redirecting to some other website that says, ha ha, gotcha.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, basically. 
[03:03:30]  It was, uh.  Can we get the guy on and give him his props?  Sure.  Uh.  Well, wait a minute.  Hold on.  I'll call him.  Uh-oh.  I inadvertently got the real guy.  Yeah.  Travis had the guys correct MySpace.  What's that about?  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  What's up, Travis?  What do you got on this?  Good evening.  When Steve asks me to do something, I usually try and do it.  And then Steve will try and do it at the same time. 
[03:04:00]  And, uh.  Okay.  And he won't, uh, you know, he won't match notes with me before he bursts into my booth  with a phone number.  Ooh.  I found, uh, I found the guy's fake MySpace.  And Sam and I immediately knew that it was fake.  Because you've made so many fake MySpaces for people.  No, that's not true.  Because, uh.  Because he had, uh.  All of his pictures were just, you know, screen caps of this kid that was on the news. 
[03:04:30]  Ah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Any idiot would know that.  Yeah, and then, and then I find his real MySpace two seconds later with, you know, personal  pictures of him and his email address.  So I sent the guy an email.  And, uh, ten minutes later, Steve bursts into my booth saying, I found his MySpace and  I've got his phone number.  And that's, uh.  And you were a wealth of information when we were, when there were six people trying to  dial this guy on the phone yesterday?  Steve, it doesn't matter.  I found the guy's real MySpace.  You found the fake one.  Well, no, the point, yeah, I understand.  And I, look, I'm not saying I didn't get, I, I, I didn't get duped. 
[03:05:00]  I did a little research before I settled on something.  I did the same thing you did.  I did the same thing you did, which is go online, you check Google, you Google the kid's  name.  Unfortunately, the one I, the one I, I wound up contacting was ranked higher than the one  you wound up contacting.  And that's why, and, and that was the first kid I got a response from.  Anyway.  Well, I look for.  Point is, listen.  Wait, did you get the guy's email you back?  No, he never emailed.  I think that's because he's in police custody.  Okay.  Yeah.  He was, uh, actually in custody when we were talking, I think, to the people yesterday. 
[03:05:30]  It's 1230 in the, in the AM.  No, he was arrested after that, I think.  Was he?  We got duped.  So, um, the world gets, uh, brainwaved.  Is that a new term?  Or just for the stupid website?  I think that's a web site.  Yeah.  Smug line.  Uh, it's safe to say John's surname and myself are probably the greatest humans alive.  That's a little pompous.  Yeah, a little.  Arrogant.  So, this is the guy that duped us?  Yeah.  Well, that guy really, uh, thinks he's the greatest person alive. 
[03:06:00]  Not a lot of humility there.  He said, it's safe to say John's surname and myself are probably the greatest humans alive.  Humans?  Are you crazy?  How about Jonas Salk?  Yeah.  You pulled a good prank.  Just throwing something out there.  Sorry.  No one gets the polio reference.  I got it.  Thank you.  They, uh, they had a good day.  Congratulations for that.  Yeah, yeah.  But that doesn't make you the greatest humans alive.  We are.  Not even for that day.  You had a good day. 
[03:06:30]  Uh, it started innocently enough.  John created a post on Corey Delaney saying what a twat he was and I searched for his MySpace  to gather some more info.  To no prevail, it suddenly clicked.  If no one can find his MySpace, why not just create one for him?  We set to work creating a cheesy looking background, that Travis noticed, with, uh, with classic  party boy music, as well as a fake pricing list for his so-called parties, and an edited  video describing virtually the same thing.  Here it is in the flesh. 
[03:07:00]  And that's where it would be on this paper, but.  No, I think it's on the next page.  Uh, we even registered the domain name, uh, CoreyDelaney.org, just, that's the one that  was given out to us, uh, to keep the hits up.  Then we just sat back and waited to have a good laugh before people would pick up that it's  a complete thud, and that it would surely fade out after a few hours.  I mean, no one would believe that this is the actual Corey Delaney, right?  Why wouldn't they?  Like, why are they making it seem like you have to be a complete idiot to think a guy  with an Australian accent that isn't even saying ridiculous things wouldn't be this guy? 
[03:07:30]  Right.  Douchebag.  Wow, great observation from Joe in Valley Stream.  Travis has legs like Matt Roloff.  Oh, God.  I think they're a little longer.  They look about the same, though.  They're pretty.  I like them.  Yeah, Matt Roloff this season on Little People Big World, he's in a swimsuit, and you get  to see his legs that are barely there.  I bet they look good.  It's not bad enough that he's a dwarf.  He's got legs that are just horrific.  Uh, the guy ends up, uh, saying, wrong! 
[03:08:00]  Within two hours, we had around 1,000 page views with a good 100 friends.  Another two hours later, we had close to 5,000 hits with four times as many friends.  Emails with job offers, marriage proposals, people asking for radio interviews, as well  as numerous requests for parties run by the man himself.  Stuff like this was regular.  I am the director of Blank Website.  I will pay you $20,000, uh, to fly you to New York if you shout out my company.  I also have a website, uh, another, uh, poster.  I also have a website.  I want you to promote my next party. 
[03:08:30]  I will fly you out to New York.  You can stay at my penthouse in Midtown, or I will get you a room at the Four Seasons.  These are creeps that want to have sex with a kid.  Of course they are.  Uh, we were shell-shocked.  Surely the globe can't be this stupid.  The MySpace is obviously a fake, judging by the following facts.  Phony price lists that are obviously a gag.  Paragraphs that pay him out to no extent.  And you can check this out for yourself.  Is that still up there?  Uh, no, because that's what's up there right now.  That, what Thana's looking at is what's up there right now.  Uh, so you can see, uh, all right, CoreyDelaney.org just says, uh, you all got brainwave. 
[03:09:00]  Uh, the fact that it says this is the who I'd like to meet section, uh, whatever.  Oh, and the small issue of Corey being held in a police station for questioning while we  did majority, while we did the majority of this stuff on MySpace.  The who I'd like to meet thing is, uh, they say I'd like to meet the real Corey.  What's his face?  Delaney.  Oh, okay.  That was hard to read there.  Who the fuck knows what time it is in that shit country?  Right.  Anyone that has an iPhone, yeah, you can just pop it right in there, boom, tells you what 
[03:09:30]  time it is.  The whole world cares.  A big party with a bunch of fucking white kids running probably through a dirt street.  No one cares.  Berries in it.  And then, and then, a dead dingo on the side of the road, a wallaby, a fucking elk taking  shits in the driveway.  And then, uh, we, we get dragged in right here.  Opie and Anthony get brainwaved.  Um, what did we?  But then came the big time. 
[03:10:00]  So, they were tricking everybody, but we were the big ones.  We're the big time.  We were the big fish.  We're rocks.  For those of you who don't know, the Opie and Anthony show is an American talk show  on satellite radio, which gains a good 10 million listeners every morning.  Get out.  Wow.  Could you show that to, show that to fucking Logan for the renegotiation?  Screw Logan.  Or is that how we got him on the phone?  Show it to Mel.  Is that how we got him on the phone?  They talked to 10 million people.  10 million people.  I left out. 
[03:10:30]  Every morning, we talked to 10 million people.  Wow.  We received an email from them at this point, in time, saying that they would like to do  a live interview with Corey Delaney on their show, if he was willing.  Only Corey wasn't there, just us and our stupid fake MySpace.  At 1223 AM, after a few connection issues, John's surname appeared as the infamous Corey  Delaney on the Opie and Anthony show.  Listen to it here.  And then they have a link.  And our interview made it to break.com.  It made it to Fark and Break and a couple other websites, too. 
[03:11:00]  So it's not like we're the only jackasses that fell for this.  The guy sounded like the Corey...  Jackass.  Sorry.  Whatever.  Right.  The guy sounded like the guy that's on the video.  An Australian accent.  He's not standing in front of a fucking webcam.  I couldn't visually verify exactly who he was.  Right.  And I'm getting kudos from guys like Drew at Fark and the guys at break going, wow, good  job. 
[03:11:30]  So nobody else is going, hey, stupid.  It's not him.  Did they take us off break?  Nope.  Oh, okay.  Well, the kudos are going to have to turn into something else.  Wait, no, that was not bad.  Almost.  What did you say?  Dudos?  Yeah, almost.  It's awful.  You made me repeat it.  And I knew what you were going for.  I figured I'd give you one because you're a little sad today.  I am a little.  I never play that game with you, but what the fuck?  But I felt that we did a good interview even though it wasn't him.  Yeah.  Hey, maybe you can get Tim Manson on the phone. 
[03:12:00]  We're going to do a prison interview with him.  Well, how about everyone listen for themselves?  Well, before we do that, can we quickly, did I make a mistake?  I hate when I make mistakes.  Yeah, a lot of them.  Hello, sir.  Hello.  Hi.  What did I do?  You said that Jonas Salk was better because the two guys were saying they were the greatest  humans alive.  Jonas Salk, sir, is dead.  Now I want my Rick Springfield tickets.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was going to say something about polio vaccine. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, no.  You got all that right.  Jonas Salk was a cocksucker.  Of course he was.  We all know that.  What?  I don't know.  Fucking polio.  Who cares about it?  Who cares about it?  Made for funny photos.  Back in the good old days.  Sure it did.  Those braces.  Bunch of fucking, a bunch of people that look like the little teeny trees from the karate  kids.  Fucking heads and metal leg things.  I'd like me metal leggings, mom. 
[03:13:00]  Hey, that's the polio.  Oh, it's awful.  Big clumpy shoes.  One fucking sole is average length and one shoe sole is nine inches long to make up.  These string bean legs.  Jonas Salk fucked all that up.  Yeah.  So let's listen.  Oh, wait a minute.  We're getting an exclusive here on line two. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, good.  That's good.  Steve?  Yeah.  You want to take this call?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes, hello.  Who's this?  Is this the Opie Anthony show?  It absolutely is.  Who's this?  This is Amelia Earhart.  Wow.  Amelia Earhart missing for so long.  Oh, yeah.  That's fantastic.  Cool.  Go ahead and fuck up your own name, Amelia.  Well, it's been lost for a while.  Thank you for taking my call. 
[03:14:00]  I appreciate it.  And please check out my web space.  Punching out.  Well, you should have punched out, perhaps.  Ah, he did well.  So let's listen to this.  This is us talking to the fake Corey yesterday.  Now it's interesting to listen to.  Listen to the signs that maybe this guy wasn't real.  Here we go.  The first clip.  We say hi.  Who's this?  Yeah.  He says John's surname.  Right.  Go ahead.  Let's say hi to Corey.  Corey, what's going on, man?  Oh, not a lot.  How are you guys?  How are you doing, man?  You're a big international star today, Corey. 
[03:14:30]  That's for sure.  I've been getting media all over the world.  It's just fantastic.  Yeah.  We checked out your video on break.com, actually.  It's on the front page.  Has it made break?  I love that site.  You like break?  I do.  I love it.  And it's moving up there on YouTube as well.  And I didn't know what to think of the clip when I first saw it.  And now I love you.  Oh, my God.  It's so embarrassing to listen to knowing that this guy fucking got us. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  You just picked him sitting there laughing.  Like, ah, ha, ha.  He didn't sound like him, though.  But he did sound like him.  That's a stupid accent.  It could be a long, long, long difference.  Yeah.  Because you know what's going through their minds?  Like, what dopes?  What dummies?  How stupid are these guys we're talking to?  Watch this.  Watch this.  They're probably writing notes to each other.  Yeah.  We're buying it.  We're all excited.  Oh, I totally nailed him.  Oh, I got him so bad.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Uh, hello, sir.  Hey, it's Jimmy Hoffa.  I'm over in Queens.  Uh, Steve, Jimmy Hoffa's on the phone. 
[03:15:30]  Really?  I've been trying to get a hold of him.  Uh, Jimmy Hoffa, do you have a MySpace?  Yes, I do.  It's shitdick.com.  Shitdick.com.  Exactly.  Not MySpace.com.  Not MySpace.  He could have made the joke sound a little better.  Why would he?  Well, why would he?  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Look, Jimmy just gets disgusted.  He's like, why would he?  Corey.  This guy sucks.  Yeah, good day, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  Are you the realson? 
[03:16:00]  You sound like Sal.  Yeah, it's Rick Coy, mate.  I don't know.  I just want to apologize for yesterday, you know?  The confusion.  You sound like Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins.  I've heard that one before, mate.  Shut it up.  No, he really talks like this.  Yeah, yeah, mate.  Why wouldn't I talk like this?  You know, he's putting it on.  Let's hear your real voice.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, guys. 
[03:16:30]  Hey, guys.  There you go.  I'm pathetic.  How you doing?  All right, bro.  Nope, bad.  All right, let's listen to more.  Could have been worse, eh?  Here's more of our interview with the fake Corey.  We look like assholes.  Did you have to face your parents yet?  No, no, no.  I'm still in hiding.  I can't say exactly where I am.  Uh-huh.  Are you still somewhere in Melbourne?  Somewhere in Melbourne.  Okay.  Have you talked to them at least?  What do you expect to happen when you go home? 
[03:17:00]  Look, look, I've seen them on TV.  I haven't talked to them.  I expect they'll ground me for the next 50 years.  Oh, God, we sound like such an asshole.  But not really, though.  These are like legit questions, and he's answering like a 16-year-old.  Just knowing that we sound excited, and they know they have us so bad.  I've made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  I've got to take a phone call here.  Who's calling?  Hello.  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Elvis Presley, baby.  Oh, Steve.  It sounds like him.  What do you think?  I think it's him.  All right, Elvis.  I need you to get her own Priscilla for me, all right?  Get her website for me, all right?  All right.  Tell him I'm alive.  All right.  We'll go to your web.  You're punching out.  Can I ask why we had a faker yesterday, but now why everyone's dead calling? 
[03:18:00]  How does it translate into contacting the dead?  Yeah, because it's tough to stay in hiding these days.  There's no other way to do this pitch, I mean, if you think about it.  And how did Elvis know to say punching out?  Yeah, he's been listening.  Hi, who's this?  This is D.B. Cooper.  D.B. Cooper.  Wow.  D.B. Cooper.  Now this one might be a lot.  Steve, I want to tell you where I am and where all my fortunes are. 
[03:18:30]  Well, tell Steve.  Back to you, Rusty.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's hear more of us talking to the fake core yesterday.  Hit it.  How much damage did they do to your parents' house?  Was it really messed up or was it not that bad?  You know, I can't remember.  I haven't been back there much.  He just fled the area.  It's just a burned out husk of a house.  Was there a lot of drinking?  I do remember it was pretty bad, but the extent of the damage, I can't remember.  Was there a lot of drinking and drugging going on? 
[03:19:00]  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  I can't even listen to this.  I don't know you.  Who is this?  Don't come here.  I'm hanging up the phone.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Lance.  Yeah.  Let's go to the next clip.  Hey, how many offers have you gotten?  He said that you got offers to throw parties now.  I'm interviewing my fucking Barbara Walters.  Oh, yeah.  Stop this.  See?  You're with me, Jimmy.  It's uncomfortable.  I'm a piece of shit.  It's uncomfortable when you know you're being had. 
[03:19:30]  All kidding aside, how do you feel?  What a fucking asshole.  If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?  Oh, that would have been a more interesting question than I was asking.  Some of your parents, we talked to your parents, just asking them real journalist questions.  Nothing interesting or funny about them.  Just excited.  I'm going to get an exclusive.  All right.  Continue with that clip.  How many offers have you gotten?  He said that you got offers to throw parties now.  Oh, absolutely.  There's a scoring in. 
[03:20:00]  You know, too many to count.  Are you going to do it?  All over Australia.  Well, it depends.  I might, you know.  For the money.  Get me out of Melbourne.  Get me out of Melbourne for a bit away from my parents.  Hold on.  There's fucking...  I want to see a fucking...  The master interviewer.  If the FBI profiler has any more tough questions.  Thought you couldn't do it?  For the money?  Fucking asshole. 
[03:20:30]  It sucks when you're had.  Oh, I'm a bag of shit.  It doesn't feel good listening to this back.  Hey, uh...  I should have started bleeding from the eyes like a Cloverfield bite victim.  Swinging.  Oh, no.  Hey.  Hey, there's a couple people that's seen the movie.  Intriguing.  Go ahead.  All right.  Hey, Steve.  Can you take this phone call, please?  Absolutely.  Hello?  Hello?  This is Osama bin Laden.  Oh.  Jeez.  Somebody get the FBI.  You infidels. 
[03:21:00]  You have not found me yet.  I'm hiding.  You think this will make the news?  I mean, we're talking with Osama bin Laden, Steve.  It absolutely will.  I'll cut it up and send it off to all the papers.  Send it off.  You think Fark will post our interview?  I don't think Fark's posted anything for a while.  Oh, you just fucked up all your connections.  I listen to the Wesley and Anthony show all the time.  All right.  Thank you, Osama.  It's good to Osama, who sounds like a fucking Hindu.  Indian customer fucking service.  We look like assholes right now, man.  Yeah, we do.  More of the fake Corey interview. 
[03:21:30]  You look like you just got done partying.  She couldn't believe you wouldn't listen to her.  That was the beauty of it.  She couldn't believe you wouldn't obey her.  Good point.  Like I said, I treated the show with a contempt it so clearly to bear.  That's a good line, though.  I know he probably was talking about us.  Yeah.  True.  True that.  Fucking.  Oh, I was praising a faker.  Fucking idiot. 
[03:22:00]  Idiot.  Yeah.  Let's see what I got over here.  Play the next clip, please.  Where can we find these videos?  We'll play more of these on the show.  Go ahead, sorry.  Keep your eye on YouTube, and hopefully some more will pop up.  Okay, we'll do that.  Hopefully some more of my fans will put it up.  That was sarcastic.  Good.  God damn liar!  You're a liar!  Yes. 
[03:22:30]  And finally, one more piece of...  Maybe you can't play in that clip when that author was in,  in that Hope They Serve Beer in Hell book, Tucker Mac.  Tucker Macs?  Tucker Macs.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was uncomfortable.  Let's play the last clip.  Maybe people shit.  Right.  Last clip.  We're going to check in with you, but the next time we try calling,  you're not going to take our call.  That happens all the time with us, with you internet stars.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  How would it be?  Remember?  Just turn it off, V-Rock.  Oh, my God. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, my God.  You internet stars.  Some kid in his fucking parents' basement.  We're part of a jerky boy tape.  Oh, my fucking God.  Oh, me and Andy, they can paint each other up.  Paint each other up.  Shit.  Can you go back?  I got to hear how uncomfortable this is for everybody.  We're going to check in with you, but the next time we try calling, 
[03:23:30]  you're not going to take our call.  That happens all the time with us, with you internet stars.  Oh, yeah.  How it is.  Remember?  One day, go on the neck.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  He was right about that.  Oh, my God.  So, it's official we got duped, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that wasn't him.  Well, Steve, you shouldn't be happy about it.  No, I'm not happy at all.  We got duped.  Steve, mm-hmm.  I'm not happy about it at all.  I don't like feeling like a jackass anymore than anybody else does. 
[03:24:00]  Fantastic.  We got one more piece of the story, and of course,  this will be good because Sam's in the studio.  Sam has no problem just...  Well, I mean, I was duped just like everybody else,  and, you know, we can't cast blame on anyone here.  But when we...  Steve was really happy about his...  Oh, I was gloating.  Are you fucking kidding?  Oh, no.  I was proud.  I walked back into the office,  and Steve was standing with his arms up in the air 
[03:24:30]  and his chest out and his elbow sticking out,  saying, and he literally said this.  I'm sure it was bad.  And that's how you executive produce.  Oh, no, you did not.  Wow, did I really say that?  I can't even look at it.  Oh, I can't.  No.  You can actually repeat that to him now and go,  and that's how you executive produce.  Wow.  Wow.  And a man in my position can't afford to be mad. 
[03:25:00]  You look ridiculous.  Wow, what a schmuck.  And that's how you executive produce.  My friends, let me school you.  He's teaching the boys a life lesson.  Hey, look at Steve.  This old dog just taught some new tricks.  Yes.  He didn't want to dance with his arms and everything,  and that's how you executive produce.  Oh, no.  That would have been a dog shit thing to say  if you'd actually done the correct booking.  Of course. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, right?  If everything went swimmingly,  that's a shitty thing to say.  And that's how you...  Oh, I cannot look at Steve.  I'm mad.  What makes today look different than another day?  Oh, no.  I just got a communique,  and it says,  Tupac here,  my new track drops at myspace.com  slash stomach staples.  Tyson Walter.  Oh.  Tyson?  Oh, how's Tyson?  Huh?  How's Tyson? 
[03:26:00]  I've got to give him a call after the show.  Long time.  We haven't heard from Tyson in a while.  That's how you executive produce.  Oh, that...  Because that's fucking Beretta,  and that's the name of that tune.  Yeah.  All right, rummy.  That's right.  Hold on.  I've got to shoot a money-grubbing cunt  right in the belly.  I say we destroy this website.  Okay.  What is it?  CoryDelaney.org?  Yeah, no, that just forwards to MySpace.  I was like, I don't know.  I think they've got... 
[03:26:30]  Some filters?  I think they've got some filters.  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve, could you say it once?  What?  What Sam said you said.  The way you said it.  Yeah.  Stand up and do it.  Come on.  Yeah, with your...  Exactly how you do it.  That's how you executive produce.  We need to clean.  No, you're acting now.  I don't know how I said it.  I really don't know how I said it.  You're standing up.  Stand up.  Stand up.  Get the feel of it.  Get into character.  Chest out.  Arms like this.  Arms like this.  Arms like this?  Yes.  I'm almost sticking out a little more.  You're playing.  I'm almost sticking out?  And that's how you executive produce. 
[03:27:00]  No?  A little more gloaty about it.  And that's how you executive produce.  Well, I can't gloat right now because I feel like utter shit.  Well, just imagine it's the real Corey, and he just called in, and the interview went  well, and I walk into the office and look at you, and you say...  And that's how you executive produce.  You're fired!  Good.  Is that how he did it yesterday?  Yeah, a little more loud and boisterous about it.  I would like to hear a more boisterous version, if you don't mind. 
[03:27:30]  I mean, I...  Yep.  Please?  More boisterous.  Yes.  And that's how you executive produce.  That was good?  That was a little better.  Thank you.  You know, without even nailing it, we all know exactly what it sounded like.  Like, I could picture exactly what it sounded like.  I was a gloating, egocentric douche.  You're in my fucking country.  Oh, I was so impressed with my ability to get somebody on the phone. 
[03:28:00]  How did your parents find out about the party?  He wanted to make a point to these guys.  Yep.  Basically, he's like, and see, you guys have been wondering for a really long time, this  is why I'm here.  This is the reason right here.  I want to thank Steve for another valuable lesson learned.  Yeah, you're welcome.  The next time I need a splash in the face of sarcasm, I'll come see you.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Or the truth. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, that's right, Steve.  Looks like today Steve's having a bite of humble pie.  Yes.  Eating a little...  Just like yesterday, and I'm sure like tomorrow will be.  Fucking...  What does humble pie taste like?  Oh, shit.  Shit?  With chewed up bits of hot dog and fucking lima beans in it.  All right, get out of here, Steve.  Oh, thank you.  Go work on a dumb character, will you?  That's what I was going to do.  Ramon!  Fact check. 
[03:29:00]  I got to go make a promo for Jake.  Yes.  This is Einstein.  The new character who does not look up anybody.  I looked into the Australian phone book.  That story, by the way.  The boys are...  Well, the boys are working on something.  For Epstein?  Maybe a counter.  Epstein!  A point-counterpoint type of thing.  So, another taste of Idol.  Just one clip that's worth playing today.  Check this out from last night. 
[03:29:30]  His...  I don't know.  He's just a weird guy with a very deep voice.  Listen to this.  It's worth playing.  Are you excited to be here?  Yes, I am.  How can I not be?  And can you sing?  Yes, I can.  And what are you going to sing today?  I'm going to sing Go Down, Moses.  Listen to this.  Okay.  Whenever you're ready.  Okay.  When Israel is in Egypt's land, let my people go. 
[03:30:00]  Oppressed so hard, they could not stand.  Let my people go.  Go down, Moses.  Down Egypt lane.  And say, fail, fail.  Let my people go.  That guy stunk.  You know what we're going to do with that, Sam?  I'm handing it to you. 
[03:30:30]  Isolate.  Let my people go.  I'm going to play that so many fucking times tomorrow.  It's going to drive people nuts.  There you go.  Dan.  What do you got?  What do you got?  From Thomas Oberbeck from Dallas.  Mr. Fabisham, that's how you executive produce.  Mr. Fabisham.  Oh, my gosh.  All right. 
[03:31:00]  Steve, could you come in the room one more time and give me that line?  Mr. Fabisham, that's how you executive produce.  That's how you executive produce.  How funny is it the second time Gleason comes in?  What, do I just came in?  Yeah, yeah.  And the way he, like, did the head when he...  Oh, and he comes in, shuts the door, and leans on the wall?  Oh, my God.  Fucking ham.  There's no one funnier than Jackie.  No.  Nope.  I just found my Honeymooners DVDs.  Oh, this is so fucking good.  I'm going to go through that again.  We were watching it, me and my ex-girlfriend. 
[03:31:30]  She's not a Honeymooner.  She doesn't know about them, really.  And when he's in Mr. Marshall's office, when he goes back for his hat, and Mr. Marshall comes in, he goes,  Dawg!  And he moves his arm with the hat, like, he swings his arm while holding the hat, like, just trying to...  Dawg!  Dawg!  God, was he funny.  That was the famous one.  Hello, Bill!  With the pen.  He's got the pen. 
[03:32:00]  He puts it in the holder like he's been working hard at the bus station.  Hello, Bill!  Dawg!  I love that reaction when he's just so busted.  Cramden!  Dawg!  We got Lennon on hold, Robert Reed on hold, Buddy Epsom on hold, John Travolta on hold, JFK Jr. on hold, and this person.  Hello, who's this?  Yeah, this is a tooth fairy.  Tooth fairy?  Yeah, yeah.  How you doing? 
[03:32:30]  It's exclusive.  Yes.  Stop stealing part of my name.  Can I plug my MySpace?  Yeah, are you coming out of Steve's closet?  What?  It's myspace.com slash Steve C. the douchebag.  I'm the douche fairy.  Before we do line of the day, there's UFO sightings all over Texas, and we kind of blew it off because, what, you get a story here and there, but it's in the cycle of the news for CNN and a bunch of the other news stations. 
[03:33:00]  And now pilots and everything.  It's not just like dummies.  It's coming from whatever pilots see something.  Yeah.  I always find them to be very credible because they know how aircraft move and what the approaching aircraft look like, and most of them are airlines ex-military.  Well, a lot of the UFOs back in the day were obviously stuff we were working on.  That's all.  Yeah.  It's obvious now.  When you see some of these things in the air, you're like, holy shit.  They had to fly those things for a while before they decided to show everybody, right?  Yeah.  Unless they're doing reverse technology.  What is that? 
[03:33:30]  It's when they believe what happened if you found, say, a craft and then tried to figure out how they did what they did and, like, it's like finding a radio and going, how does this work?  And then taking it apart and building backwards to try to create it.  You're reversing the technology to learn how they got to that point.  Is that a theory with the UFO people?  Yes.  That's how they theorize it.  Yeah, reverse engineered.  Reverse engineering.  Reverse engineering.  And some of our shit is actually because of what they found.  Yes.  Wow.  That's why.  That's the speculation.  That's pretty cool. 
[03:34:00]  I've never heard that one before.  Is there a website for that?  Oh, there's a million.  Yes.  You follow me.  My space slash space aliens that will call to an interview.  Hey, guys, I got Betty and Barney Hill on the phone.  Betty and Barney Hill.  Seems they had anal probes and needles stuck in their navels.  Yes.  The gentleman is colored.  That's right.  The aliens flew them to Neptune and gave them a lecture on the immorality of their union. 
[03:34:30]  Of their interracial marriage.  Yes.  The alien said it would be a malala.  Mongrel racing humans.  Oh, good.  What happened?  Sam's got something else?  No, just one.  Oh, no.  What's this about?  I'm sad.  Pat Duffy's dad?  Yeah.  Pat Duffy's dad.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  How we doing today?  Hello?  It really is.  Yeah, what's going on?  It's Patrick's one-year anniversary. 
[03:35:00]  Put him on the payroll.  Maybe he can do Steve's job.  What do you think?  You've been here a year?  I have, yes.  You've been on the payroll yet?  No.  You get paid?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened?  It sucks.  I don't know.  Hi, Pat.  Hello.  Are you trying to get your son a job, sir?  Duff, that's your cue.  Hello?  Hello.  Yo, Duff.  Pay attention.  You call your dad Duff?  I do.  There's no fatherly respect here at all. 
[03:35:30]  There was a trend when I was in college where, you know, people started calling their parents  by their first name.  So I tried it.  Started by Greg Brady, as a matter of fact.  Okay, so maybe it was like a rerun or whatever, but it was a trend for a day or two.  So I decided to try it on dear old Fred and got smacked across the face.  Yeah, it doesn't work.  So I can't imagine that you get away with calling your dad Duff.  I do.  So yeah, he didn't like it at first, but he got used to it. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, better.  Yeah.  Well, the other two kids call me by my first name because they're my stepkids, but he's  my real kid, and he calls me Duff sometimes, but he doesn't get away with it often, but  he does.  I want to thank Pat Duffy's dad for completely stopping what otherwise was a fantastic radio  show.  Oh, we were having quite a run.  Quite a run we were having.  That's what happens.  You can go to MySpace.  All right, Duffy. 
[03:36:30]  Sorry, buddy.  All right.  Or Duff.  Duff, yes.  All right.  We got to get to the UFO thing.  So this is what we know about the UFOs in Texas so far.  I'd say it was a half a mile wide and about a mile long.  What?  Jesus.  No, it wasn't.  All right.  Well, it wasn't that big.  This is a businessman slash pilot, though.  He's a dumb cunt.  Nothing a half a mile wide.  A half a mile wide, a mile long.  What the fuck is that?  Independence Day?  Shut up.  And the town constable.  He's a fool. 
[03:37:00]  I'd say it was a half a mile wide and about a mile long.  It's humongous.  Whatever it was.  Businessman Steve Allen is also a pilot.  He described flashing lights exactly the same as Constable Leroy Gateland says he saw  20 miles to the south.  They were dancing around and they were flickering, but they weren't just doing this.  They were like, just moving.  Like a light show?  Yeah.  Similar to a light show.  If you think it's a half a mile wide and a mile long, you're seeing a bunch of craft. 
[03:37:30]  You're not seeing that.  Or a huge reflection.  Or aliens.  Yeah.  Something that big with radar technology wouldn't go unnoticed.  It couldn't breach the airspace without being really seen.  Oh, this is breaking news.  Steve saw the UFO.  Maybe we ought to get him in here.  It was, I saw it.  It was cylindrical shaped.  Had a head on it.  And it was coming right from my mouth.  My mouth is an international UFO docking station. 
[03:38:00]  They land there.  They spit out their cargo.  And then they back out.  And go fly away.  Brad Wiener from Kings Park, New York writes,  This is L. Ron Hubbard checking in.  I would like to promote Steve to Thetan Level 9.  What time should I call in?  More on the UFOs in Texas. 
[03:38:30]  And then they both say it took off.  And it just, on a sudden, it just shot off.  And it went directly southeast, or northeast correction.  And at a high rate of speed.  It's so fast that I can't keep up with my binoculars to it.  But what gives it all credibility is the fact that folks who saw it seem so trustworthy.  Alan has received 30 calls from other witnesses.  The military denies it has anything to do with this.  The constable says he hopes it's military, and he hopes it's ours. 
[03:39:00]  We would like an explanation.  We're not all a bunch of idiots.  You know, there's so many people that saw it.  Wow.  We're not a bunch of idiots.  You've got to preface what you say with, we're not a bunch of idiots.  Wow.  It doesn't bode well.  But as soon as you say you saw a UFO, unfortunately, a lot of people think you're an idiot.  A mile long, this thing was?  I will tell you this.  Project Blue Book, which I don't believe they completely stopped.  What's that?  What's that?  The Air Force's public investigation into UFOs. 
[03:39:30]  I actually know.  I was just playing the part of Joe Lissner.  They actually used to investigate UFO reports.  The military would come to your house.  And it was done to debunk them, basically.  What happened was, apparently the guy who was in charge of it, against his better judgment,  actually became a believer because of the small percentage of cases that just couldn't  be explained away.  The majority of them could be. 
[03:40:00]  And I heard the military always liked the UFO thing, and they perpetuated it because they  liked people guessing, well, what is this?  As opposed to understanding that it was our technology, that was being tested, too.  But I don't know.  I've heard too many pilot reports.  Like, when I've heard pilot transmissions, where they see Art Belgus a lot of the shit  on the show.  And that kind of creeps me out, because pilots, again, are not dummies.  When they're flying a commercial airliner...  They understand the whole flying thing.  They get it.  And when something's making movements, like a Harrier jet goes up and then takes off and 
[03:40:30]  can stop and land.  But when they see things making movements, it's just an impossibility that a craft that  we are aware of can make.  That kind of makes me a little, I guess, less skeptical.  I'm from the school of thought that it's weather balloons or swamp gas.  Sometimes, sure.  That's what I think all UFO sightings are.  Are you sure you don't know?  And what comes out of your ass?  Swamp gas.  I'm sure that's a lot of them.  But there are some that they just could not explain away. 
[03:41:00]  Are we alone in the universe?  No.  Couldn't be.  I don't think so.  It's impossible.  I mean, there's billions of stars and billions of galaxies.  You just have to have the right distance from a star.  And, you know, you have to...  Dr. Cuckold told you that, right?  Well, no.  I've read that many times.  Dr. Cuckoo.  Cuckoo.  Would I'm sure agree.  Yeah.  I think we're...  I think this whole thing is a giant pussy. 
[03:41:30]  What?  How could that even be possible?  And all the other stars are spermatozoa, and our spermatozoa hit the egg.  Maybe.  I think space is full of atoms and molecules, and we're just spinning around like electrons 
[03:42:00]  around a nucleus, which is the sun, and we are making up a portion of matter that is so  much larger than we could even comprehend.  Maybe just, you know, we're a molecule in someone's hair on some giant world somewhere else.  And that's what we are.  We just keep spinning around.  How do you explain the construction worker behind you, though? 
[03:42:30]  We figured, like, some shit out.  Sitting on this little electron we call Earth.  I'm watching a guy working on a building right behind you.  Yeah.  Molecules can't do that.  No, we're not molecules.  We live on an electron spinning around a nucleus, an atom, and the universe is...  I mean, galaxies are just huge molecules of atoms all together, and the universe is the  whole thing, the matter.  Maybe.  Maybe. 
[03:43:00]  And wouldn't that suck if we were just, like, a molecule and, like, a piece of shit?  A piece of giant dog shit that's...  I know.  ...in some other dimension.  A yard somewhere?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, one day, you mind your business, a giant sneaker comes through the ceiling.  Oh, no.  Some poor guy.  A giant sneaker.  Some poor guy.  Fucking Monty Python.  In another fucking universe, is now sitting on a park bench, fucking wiping logs off his 
[03:43:30]  new white sneakers.  I guess it sucks all over.  It doesn't matter where you are.  Absolutely not.  Life stinks.  Yeah.  It really does.  That's how we end.  We...  Yeah.  Our world ends, and he's all pissed because he's scraping shit off of his sneaker.  Yeah.  He accidentally...  He's fucking...  And that's all it was.  Yeah.  All you see is a giant tread.  That is hilarious.  And every creature in our universe hears,  God damn it!  And we're all dead.  Just completely wiped out. 
[03:44:00]  I'm going to discuss this with my yogi today.  Can you talk to your yogi?  I should sip some yogi tea.  Yogi.  And that's it.  I...  Yes.  I have to go home and nap so I can go to the gym.  Suck this cock.  I got to get big.  Big and muscular.  That's right.  Big and yours.  So you could fight off the Thetans.  That's exactly it.  Let's do line of the day.  That big selfish fool. 
[03:44:30]  What happened?  Raging bull.  Oh.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on 26 world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute  snow conditions.  You must log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Runner-up line of the day.  She blinded me with cankles.  That can't be.  Steve from Bayshore.  With cankles.  I think that for punishment, I should fart in Steve's face. 
[03:45:00]  You got a fart?  Yes.  Steve?  They're running, man.  All right.  Here's another runner-up line of the day as we get Steve.  No LOLs?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  So, uh...  I kind of enjoyed it.  Oh.  This is the position I'm in, though.  I, uh...  Doggy?  I got...  That was the second one.  Yes. 
[03:45:30]  I pulled the old double gag.  Steve?  Um...  Hello.  Jim is...  What?  ...more than happy to try to fart in my face.  No, no.  I mean, you should have to volunteer for it.  I think that it should be a punishment.  There's no volunteering.  No.  It's your punishment today, Steve.  No.  It's either that or bare-bottom spanking.  It's your choice.  No, there's no bare-bottom spanking.  There's no...  I've smelled plenty of Jim's farts, and they're lovely, but he's not going to be farting in  my face today.  What if it's like a foot away?  I'm not going to touch it.  He did it five minutes ago, a foot away, and I said...  No, no. 
[03:46:00]  It's like...  It's not like him farting in anyone's face.  Anyway, I'll do this.  I'll fart in my hat, and then you put it on.  All right.  Go fart in your hat.  You got to pull your pants down, Jimmy.  No, I can't.  All right.  I will.  Nah, it wasn't good.  I'm not going to shit my hat.  You got to shit your hat.  That's what I was getting at.  Okay.  He just...  Stop airing it out.  He just handed over the fart hat. 
[03:46:30]  This is not a pleasant-smelling hat.  We're fucking children.  All right.  Smell the hat now.  That won't smell.  He already aired it out.  Smell the hat.  It won't smell.  Yeah, there's a remnant.  God damn it.  All right.  Get out of here.  Good.  I'm so disappointed.  Here's the final runner-up line of the day.  Fire extinguisher like that?  You might be right, but it might...  It's like...  You imagine...  Like, you're a paramedic.  You're trying to push a stretcher,  and there's a wild animal charging you. 
[03:47:00]  Here.  He jumps right through the foam and bites you.  He likes the foam.  He likes the foam.  He likes the foam.  Foam!  Your animal rants are...  I love talking about animals.  Some of the best things you do, man.  I love animals.  I'm an animal fan.  I'm an animal supporter.  I'm an animal lover.  You should throw...  You've got to bring some of that to the stage where you just...  Oh, I have been.  But where you just go off script and just beat up a defenseless animal.  Last night's set was all about the tiger attack, fucking bear attacks, and ants. 
[03:47:30]  Because I saw a fucking documentary on ants.  Did you?  What was that about?  About the...  You already told us.  ...deadliest ants in the world.  You already told us.  They marched 20 miles in a colony.  They marched...  We know enough about the ants.  Oh, but there's just such pests, Anthony.  ...that's just such pests.  Can you imagine barefoot walking through, like, a line of those fucking nasty ants? 
[03:48:00]  Like, you'd step on a bunch, but they would overtake you and just kill you.  Yeah, that would rule.  20 million?  Oh, I mean, that would suck.  Can we do an ant gag on our show?  The ants are fucking...  I want...  ...fucking ant farms.  Yuck.  I want ants on penises.  No, they won't let us do that.  Why?  Why?  What's wrong with that?  How about uncles?  How about uncles?  Oh, my God.  SkynColoradoNow.com, thank you.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes... 
[03:48:30]  ...comes...  ...the line of the day.  The line of the day.  The way you see it?  Yeah.  Okay.  What?  Cross-eyed?  Through mo-bangs?  And that's how you executive produce.  Oh, my yes!  I knew that was coming.  Oh, that's great.  I was wondering when we were going to lose Greg Audio! 
[03:49:00]  Oh, funny.  And that's how you executive produce.  I love that.  Yuck.  Well, here we go.  Listen to this.  Couples Cherry Darts is going down, I believe, two weeks from tomorrow.
