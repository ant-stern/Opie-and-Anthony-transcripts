<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a commercial for Consumer Reports regarding HDTV setup, followed by a discussion of a bizarre "leprechaun" sighting in Mobile, Alabama.  This transitioned into a conversation about the Discovery Channel's "The Most Dangerous Catch," focusing on the dangers of crab fishing.  The hosts played Gordon Lightfoot's "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald," interjecting sarcastic and crude comments and taking listener calls, including one from a former Alaskan fisherman defending the show.

A studio guest, "Andrew" (referred to as "Big A"), a Bronx cab driver with a noticeable speech impediment, was introduced.  The hosts used Andrew's speech difficulties for comedic effect, having him deliver a news report covering a building collapse, Chief Justice Rehnquist's illness, Cameron Diaz's legal battle, Brad Pitt's hospitalization, Tiger Woods's British Open performance, and a man's death after an encounter with a horse. They also engaged him in tongue twisters.  Andrew's potential participation in a future karaoke segment was discussed.

A later segment featured Andrew's karaoke performance of "Waiting for a Girl Like You" and "Brown Eyed Girl," highlighting his nervousness and stuttering. The hosts teased him about his shyness and past karaoke experiences, including anecdotes about his karaoke bar and alcohol consumption.  A leaked audio recording of a sexually explicit PalTalk conversation between Andrew and "Blaze Angel," an Australian woman, was then played.  The hosts reacted with a mix of shock, amusement, and disbelief, teasing the release of more explicit clips in a future show. Callers reacted with humor and shock.  The show included numerous commercial breaks and short news segments read by Andrew, one of which covered Christian Slater's arrest for groping.  XM radio promotions for Thriller, Unmasked, and other channels were also aired.


A subsequent segment focused on further audio and video clips from Andrew's phone sex conversation with Blaze Angel, emphasizing her laughter and Andrew's obliviousness to her lack of genuine arousal.  The audio revealed Blaze Angel eliciting Andrew's real name. The hosts expressed shock and amusement at Andrew's penis size.  Andrew and Blaze Angel both called in, engaging in a heated exchange with Andrew calling Blaze Angel a "fucking cunt" and Blaze Angel calling him a "bloody sex pest."  Callers weighed in on the situation.  A drunk man later wets his pants on air for a prize, prompting raucous commentary. Laszlo was mentioned as being in the studio. XM radio advertisements were interspersed.

The show also included a segment featuring historical facts and XM radio advertisements for "Unmasked" with Carlos Mencia and an Esquire Minute about Richard Price's *Lush Life*. An upcoming animation festival was announced.  A highly sexually explicit and offensive discussion about Anthony Cumia's penis size followed, involving graphic descriptions and hyperbole from the hosts and callers, filled with vulgar and racially insensitive language.  Cumia recounted a childhood encounter with a Native American woman.  The conversation became increasingly outrageous and fantastical, with frequent interruptions from callers. The segment concluded with further comedic, sexually suggestive, and racially charged remarks before transitioning to sports news and more XM radio advertisements.

A chaotic in-studio interview with a guest named G.I. followed. The conversation touched on O.J. Simpson's trial and Johnny Cochran's death, then veered into G.I.'s personal experiences, including his claim to have scavenged cans near Ground Zero on 9/11. G.I. used racial slurs and highly inappropriate commentary.  A heated exchange between G.I. and another guest, Master Poe, resulted in physical threats and a near-brawl, culminating in G.I.'s removal from the studio.

The show then transitioned to a more conventional interview with actor Michael Madsen, who was joined in the studio by Bob Kelly. Madsen discussed his Hollywood career, complaining about industry politics and sharing anecdotes about working with Bruce Willis and on various films, including graphic descriptions of sex scenes and a death scene in a bathroom.  A subsequent segment focused solely on the Michael Madsen interview, covering his sale of his *Reservoir Dogs* Cadillac on eBay, meeting Fred Astaire, his early acting experiences, his lack of formal training, and his roles in films like *Sin City*. He detailed his childhood, run-ins with the law (including stealing a church turntable), relationships with other actors, his book of poetry, and his website where he reviews his films. The hosts also discussed Madsenâ€™s film "Boarding Gate."  The interview concluded with promotional mentions for various XM radio shows and segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  TV. I'm Ernest Spranz. When you first plug in your new HDTV, everything won't magically turn  into high definition. You have to make sure you have everything required to watch HD. A surprising  number of HDTV owners, about half by some estimates, are not getting HD programming because they're  missing something. To get high def content from a cable, satellite, or phone company, you need  high def service. Digital programming can be standard or high definition. You must specify  that you want high def. Your receiver or set-top box must also be high def capable. Next, you'll 
[00:00:30]  need component video or HDMI cables to connect the receiver to the TV. Other cables such as  S-Video can't carry high def. Finally, you must be tuned to an HD channel. The high def version  of a channel has a different number from its usual standard definition counterpart and usually  has the letters HD in the on-screen program guide listing it. When you turn on your new  TV, don't panic if it doesn't look as stunning as it did in the showroom. The default factory 
[00:01:00]  settings on most TVs are designed to create a super bright, vividly colored image to lure  shoppers, but they're almost always a bad choice for use at home. Tweaking the settings can greatly  improve picture quality. Adjusting picture settings individually can yield better results,  but it's easier to use presets, so try them out first. I'm Ernie Sprantz for Consumer Reports,  online at ConsumerReports.org. The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-CANADA, 877-438-9677. 
[00:01:30]  The virus is the enemy show.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community, many of you bringing binoculars,  cancorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it looks like a leprechaun to me. I got to do a little bit of a treat.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah? Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night. If you shine a light in its direction, 
[00:02:00]  it suddenly disappears. This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun  looks like. Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and  explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead that got hold to the wrong stuff and it told him to get up in the  tree and play a leprechaun.  We're going to get down to the bottom of this. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it's still on there, guy. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This waters off spales right here. This is a special leprechaun flute which has been passed  down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather who was Irish. I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree.  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree. I want to know where the gold is. I want the gold. 
[00:03:00]  Give me the gold. I want the gold.  The crowd started gathering around sunset.  It's a face.  A face, the eye, the nose, the mouth.  The friday mouth.  It's just a face. And right now, he's not happy. I'm not kidding. It's a frowning face.  A leprechaun. It looked like, last night it looked just like a little leprechaun. It's still up there. 
[00:03:30]  The people who see the leprechaun say you can see it better at night.  And that's when the crowds really start coming out.  Now, step back some of y'all to see it. If you just look right there in the middle, you see it. Right there, you see it?  You see it?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  Y'all see it?  Like he's smiling right now.  I want to see it. If it's here, I want to see it. When is it going to pop up?  Well, actually, my brother came in from Atlanta last Sunday night.  He was standing out, standing around.  And he said, y'all not going to believe this, but you're like a man that's up in that tree. 
[00:04:00]  And y'all like, man, he's crazy.  Pretty soon, there were more people creating traffic jams, all to see what has become known as the leprechaun.  And he was smiling.  He was smiling, huh?  Uh-huh.  And then at one moment, I thought he tipped his hat.  What do you think about all the crowds that have come? What has it been like the last couple of nights as far as the crowd?  It looked like Monograw. All we need is to float.  Now, some people say they've seen the leprechaun, and some people say they haven't. 
[00:04:30]  But one thing's for sure, nobody's found a pot of gold yet.  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:30]  E-Rock!  I'll throw my waist on you.  It's the worst of opium.  Boring!  No one is listening!  Oh, what a creepy mess.  It's just bad.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  Unfortunately, we're just horrible dullards.  I got to tell you, though, one of the best reality shows on TV is that goddamn stupid crab fishing show.  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing. 
[00:06:00]  The hell is the crab fishing show?  The most dangerous catch on Discovery Channel.  You ever hear about this?  No.  They put cameras on a bunch of these ships that go out into the Bering Sea in Alaska.  I thought they put cameras on toilet seats.  No.  I was like, what are you talking about?  Crab fishing.  Crab fishing.  They put them on all these crabbing boats, and they go out into the Bering Sea.  They're by Alaska, and they go crabbing.  Now, you'd think, okay, how is that a TV show? 
[00:06:30]  Apparently, this is like one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.  People dying all the time.  And it's a reality show because they follow these people's lives and personalities and their jobs.  And what we've all wanted to see on reality shows, people are dropping dead.  Really?  People are dying.  They show the captain of some ship showing how to put on some emergency gear,  and then they're out on a boat, and one of the cameramen see the captain on the radio.  And the ship capsized, sunk. 
[00:07:00]  The captain that was just doing the little thing on his gear, and six of his crewmen are dead.  And another guy falls overboard.  He's dead.  People are getting injured all the time.  This is reality.  Why else would you watch a crab fishing show?  They're like, oh, I hope they bring up a bunch of crabs.  They're going to interview the crabs.  They have new deaths every week.  It's like a holocaust.  The crab holocaust.  Unbelievable.  But I got roped into watching this, and I'm watching it now all the time. 
[00:07:30]  Most dangerous catch.  I never knew this show was on TV.  I sit there doing the Regan bit.  I'm watching fishing.  I'm not even fishing.  I'm watching fishing.  But is the crab show, it's just being filmed.  There's no phony reality angle, right?  It's just really being filmed.  No, it's just these guys.  They're all a little kooky to be out there.  They work for, it's only a few days, a couple of times a year that they do this.  And they could walk away with upwards of 10, 15 grand each for just a few days' work. 
[00:08:00]  But it's just the worst job ever.  There's no immunity challenge?  No, no challenges.  Actually, they do have a Budweiser-sponsored crab count with which ship brings in the most  pounds of crab.  They should have like a body count because people are dropping dead.  And there was one ship just keeled over.  And they found out that they had too many of these crab traps on it.  And it was top-heavy, overloaded. 
[00:08:30]  The captain, yeah, screwed up and paid with his life.  Was that like by Lake Gichiguni?  Was it going from Cleveland into Canada somewhere?  And it was a storm?  The Edmund Fitzgerald?  Well, our crab pots were full and we came into shore.  I really like that song.  Jimmy was asking his questions.  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot.  This song goes on forever.  I love it, though.  And the water was at my ankles and this song goes on another hour. 
[00:09:00]  Is that the song that makes you just get all tingly, Jimmy?  I just like it because I like the fact that he's doing a 40-minute ballad about a boat that's  I looked at the fuel gauge, it was three-quarters full.  And we motored on toward our destination.  And then we bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Hey, we could kill seven minutes.  Let this play today.  He asked for my money back.  He said, drop dead, you horse-toothed Jew.  You're getting nothing back. 
[00:09:30]  The legend lives on from the Chippewa home down.  It's a big lake they call Gichigumi.  Gichigumi, all right.  The lake, it is said, never gives up for dead when the skies of November turn gloomy.  Gloomy.  Gichigumi with gloomy.  With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.  I smelt bad from fish and put on perfumey.  That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed when the gales of November came early. 
[00:10:00]  Have they cast off yet?  We untied the bow line and untied the stern.  And I started the engine with a turn of the key.  Jesus.  Every friggin' step of the way in the Edmund Fitzgerald.  We get it already.  We get it.  You're on a boat.  I took a compass heading of 135 and I turned the wheel and the purser got me my coffee.  I take it light and sweet, but he made it too dark and I sent him back to the galley. 
[00:10:30]  All right, what happened?  What happened next?  Could it be the north wind they'd been feeling?  I went to sleep in my sleep paralysis and I woke up to the exorcist's face in my bed.  The wind and the wires made a tattletale sound in the way it broke over the railings.  This song's only half over and I still see the dock.  I made you as the captain did true. 
[00:11:00]  T'was the witch in November and stealing.  I forgot my wallet in my car so we turned the ship around.  And we docked again and I figured I'd stop for a beer.  Tune in and two hours later when the ship finally sinks.  Enough!  And then they're throwing a musical interlude just to make it longer. 
[00:11:30]  Christ!  I put on my life vest and helped my crew put it on too.  And we stood there and, well, the water's now up to our knees.  See, look, it's still going.  We'll take a few phone calls and we'll go back to the song in a minute.  Scott in Arizona.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Pretty good.  Well, hey, don't get me wrong here. 
[00:12:00]  You guys are great, man.  I mean, I love the shit out of you guys.  I got a little complaint about the crabbing thing.  I spent 15 years up in Alaska commercial fishing.  And then I just got my big truck this morning.  And boom, first thing I turned you guys on this morning, you guys complaining about the show.  What?  Yeah.  Who's complaining?  Oh, you said you didn't like it.  And then you're making fun of a bunch of fish.  I love the crab show.  That's what I was saying.  Were you listening or were you like me? 
[00:12:30]  He likes it.  I'm not listening.  You better listen to the replay to hear what you missed.  Listen to the replay.  I love the crab show.  I said I can't stop watching it.  Oh, I apologize.  I said my brain fart.  My thing was I was saying that all crabbers are bums and incompetents.  Anthony was disagreeing.  Well, I have to agree with you there.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to move on.  Tad again from San Francisco.  I watched the History Channel show on the Edmund Fitzgerald.  It took three minutes for the boat to sink.  So it takes longer for the song to play than it took for the boat to actually sink.  Well, let's see where the song is. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  Where are we?  He had water coming in.  And the good ship and crew was in peril.  All right.  It's just starting to sink.  We'll go back to the song in a little while and see what happens.  Let's take a couple of minutes.  I said, hey, dude, what do you think about this?  He said, I don't know.  There might be a hole in the boat.  So we went down to the engine room and, yeah, there was a hole.  And we sat and smoked a cigarette or two because it really wasn't that bad.  Let's say hi to Alex in Boston.  Alex?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got two points. 
[00:13:30]  Jimmy, don't you play the most dangerous catch every night?  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  Jimmy tangling with some tainted vagina.  It's me on a boat with three Craigslist prostitutes.  And crabs are involved also.  Very nice.  And Rick Ross buys a car like people buy drugs.  Give him the money first.  Wait.  And I'll come back with the car.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  You should have started with that one.  Speaking of cars.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Jimmy. 
[00:14:00]  Let's go back to the song and see where Gordon Lightfoot is at.  Uh-oh.  I think it's down.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll check back.  He's still in that musical interlude there.  Who's that other ballad singer?  Oh, Steve Flamefoot.  He's like.  With the Captain Wyatt and the water coming in.  Steve Flamefoot. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, 27,000 times more than the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Jesus.  He's separated the T and the Z.  We have a little problem.  The stripples, they won't take their clothes off.  Stripples?  The stripples.  Yes.  They're kind of like an Australian children's naked singing group.  All right.  Before we go to break, let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is here.  All right.  You still going?  Leo Tech.  Jesus.  Does anyone know where the love of God goes? 
[00:15:00]  When the words turn the minutes to hours.  Minutes to hours.  The searchers all say they'd have made whitefish pay if they'd put 15 more miles behind her.  Huh?  They might have split up or they might have capsized.  They may have broke deep and took water.  And all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  We'll go back to Gordon Lightfoot after the break.  He's still singing along.  Now he's singing about the survivors and everything.  The wife remarried and had three kids and can't even remember his name.  Been 15 years and now I'm going to sing about his children's experience in elementary school.  That's a bit of a long tune. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, Christ.  I think we were making that point, Jimmy.  Oh.  That's true.  I just jump in like, hey, guys, I have a thought.  That's a long song.  Long song.  Gordon.  You've come.  Gordon Lightfoot.  Heavy on the pen, though.  And my typewriter ran out of Vink.  Yeah.  He doesn't get to the end of the end. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, that's hilarious.  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you doing, Chicken Lips?  That's very mean-spirited.  What?  What?  What's painful?  What?  That fucking song.  That Gordon Lightfoot song.  You don't like that song?  No, dude.  It's fucking horrible.  It's not horrible.  Oh, it's terrible.  What do you prefer?  What kind of song do you prefer?  If I could just jump in and make a relative comparison?  Anything but that.  That's a long thing, sir. 
[00:17:00]  I'll listen to Brother Joe's Journey covers.  You know?  All right.  I just don't do it.  This is all I had to say.  First of all, Loverboy did not do that fucking song with the Outfield, that I Want to Lose Your  Love Tonight.  Oh, yeah.  It was the Outfield.  Very good.  And Night Ranger's other song was Don't Tell Me You Love Me.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that was a huge hit.  Yeah, I remember that one.  Thank you, Chris.  Very informative.  You don't like Gordon Lightfoot, but you know Night Ranger and Loverboy songs from 1981.  Yeah, well, come on, dude.  1981, I was around then.  Like, I wasn't around in whatever the hell.  When did that song come out? 
[00:17:30]  That Gordon Lightfoot.  I'm guessing in the mid-70s.  Probably after the actual accident.  All right.  Yeah.  My parents were eating granola, and I wasn't born yet, so.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, guys.  We've got to get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  Where is he at in this stupid song of his?  Lake Huron Rose Superior sings in the rooms of her ice-water mansion.  Oh, Michigan steams like a young man's dreams.  The islands and bays are for sportsmen. 
[00:18:00]  Then the sun's supernova, then the earth was burned to a crisp.  Then it's 50 billion years in the future.  Takes in what Lake Erie can send her.  All right, we'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  We're Mylar suits, and we colonize Mars.  And Danley finally got a sign on the TV show.  God, did I fuck that one up?  And Danley finally got a sign on the TV show.  I wouldn't hurt you, Danley. 
[00:18:30]  I love every goddamn half a sign on your head.  And when should we take Danley to see a doctor?  As soon as possible.  I'm an elsehole.  Danley.  Oh, that's funny.  Devin from New Hampshire.  Andrea Yates played that song as she drowned her kid.  And the next one looked up and said, hey, what's going on here, Mom?  When the bubbles stop, four more to go. 
[00:19:00]  And the workers all, oh, shit.  The searchers all say they'd have made 21 if this bitch had taken her medicine.  Five little unopened boxes under the tree.  Well, speaking of Gordon Lightfoot, let's end to disappointed grandparents. 
[00:19:30]  Let's see where Gordon is in the song.  As I set off to sail from Modesto.  A splash and a tear as my wife disappeared neath the blue briny waters of Modesto.  Are we finally at the end?  I don't know. 
[00:20:00]  No.  Oh.  Is that it?  In a musty old hall in Detroit, they prayed in the Maritime Sailor's Cathedral.  Oh, she's been pregging now.  The church bell chimed to the ring 29 times.  Five times.  For each man on the end, Fitzgerald.  The legend lifts on from the Chippewa on down of the big lake they call.  Down to that camp, man. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  We'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  I just want to hear the line where he says, a grandmother's wasted charm bracelet.  As grandma sadly looks at the bottle of Johnson's baby shampoo.  Unceremoniously dumps it in the toilet.  Because it's useless.  And the quack of a rubber ducky in the trash pile. 
[00:21:00]  What is wrong with you?  You are the worst.  You're the worst.  You're the worst.  Holy jeez.  This is hysterically awful.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  Oh, my chest.  Let's see if we can get to the end of this one.  Susan Smith sent the van down the boat ramp.  Two little tykes in their car seat.  She said, you little cock blockers, it's been nice to know you.  The big one said, mommy, why is we going backward? 
[00:22:00]  And she went on the news and pointed that Coco had taken her children.  Speaking of the song, let's see if, let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is.  Oh, there it is. 
[00:22:30]  Fading out.  Wow.  Finally, we made it to the end.  Thank God.  I got tears coming down my cheeks.  What do you want?  You're listening.  This is Opie and Anthony.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Or do you want you're listening to?  No, this is him.  Oh, this is him. 
[00:23:00]  I said my name.  I see.  Sorry.  Beg your pardon.  Hi.  Okay.  This is Brian Cox.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  More than a quarter century in the making.  That's been a real blessing.  35 albums.  My life's been grand.  Almost 60 number one hits.  Over 400 songs.  All my exes live in Texas. 
[00:23:30]  The music.  The life.  The career.  It's been a long time since I've mowed the grass.  Three jukeboxes full of boot scraping honky tonk hits.  Straight country.  Debuts April 1st on XM17.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day.  Lots of folks out there are changing their own oil on their late model GM vehicles.  And of course, these vehicles are equipped with GM's oil life monitor system.  To properly measure oil life, the system must, I repeat, must be reset after changing oil. 
[00:24:00]  Here's how to do it as per GM.  One, turn the ignition key to the run position.  Two, fully push and release the accelerator pedal three times within five seconds.  Three, if the oil change soon light flashes, the system is resetting itself.  Start the vehicle and the oil life monitor indicator will change to 100%.  Should the change oil soon light come back on after going through this procedure, the system has not reset itself.  Repeat the procedure and it should be reset. 
[00:24:30]  If it doesn't, the system must be scanned for codes and the problem tracked down and repaired.  Got a car question or need more automotive information?

Oh, nobody tells an Irishman to put down his bottle on St. Patrick's Day.  You heathen.  This wee man will kick your butt as fast as you can say shillelagh.  Oh, kick shillelagh, right. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, jeez.  All right, Leprechaun, listen, we're going to give it one last try.  Okay.  And after that, we're going to call it a wrap.  Okay.  Here we go.  Vitamita vegemin.  Oh, jeez.  It's got vitamins and minerals and reefer...  And meat.  Oh, I don't feel so good.  You look green, Leprechaun.  Okay, I think I'm going to take a ween up now.  Okay.  Happy St. Party's Day.  Happy St. Party's Day, Leprechaun. 
[00:29:00]  That's a wrap.  It's the worst.  It's so good.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  All right, why don't we get Andrew in here to do some news for us?  All righty.  Andrew, I don't know.  What do we say about this guy, Anthony?  Well, he's a fan of the show.  Yeah.  He takes a lot of pictures.  Yeah.  He has a speech impediment. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, we discovered him on the streets.  He gets a little nervous.  The other day when we were getting ready for the WOW motorcycle ride, that was a huge success  to Philly.  He's been to a lot of my brother's shows.  Yeah.  Takes a lot of pictures.  Yeah.  He posts on the message board.  Yeah.  And he's now in the studio.  And he drives an independent cab.  Oh, that's right.  In the Bronx.  Forgot about that.  Which is very dangerous.  You hear about those guys that were robbing cabs and they were found because they found 
[00:30:00]  a CD on their possession and it was a rap song that they recorded bragging about how  they robbed cabs.  Jesus.  Brilliant, isn't it?  They made a rap song detailing how they robbed these cabs.  They would call up a cab to have them meet them at a corner or a house address and then  three or four guys would run out from the parked cars with bandanas around their mouths.  Tell them, Fred.  And they would put guns in the guy's face, steal his money and his cell phone, and then 
[00:30:30]  slit his tires so he couldn't follow them.  And then they made a rap song about the whole thing?  And then they made rap songs about how they did it and what they did and the cops found  the CD when they arrested one of them for, I'm sure, helping out to doing some kind of  public service, I'm sure.  Right.  You ever been robbed, though?  Not yet, no.  Never?  I hope not.  How long have you been doing it?  Over 10 years.  10 years and you've never been robbed and you work in the Bronx.  Do you not pick up certain people? 
[00:31:00]  Is that what you do?  Yeah.  Not really.  I pick up the calls, I'm told, off the phone.  Off the phone?  Yes.  So if you hear somebody go, yo, I need a cab, man, you go, oh, sorry, I'm booked.  And then if you hear them go, hello, I need a ride out of this horrible neighborhood.  Then you're on your way.  And that's helped you from being robbed over 10 years.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  Good system.  What's the craziest thing that happened to you while driving a cab?  The craziest?  Or the wild, you know.  Just a memorable moment in your cab driving.  One time, I had to pick up a customer and they were picking up their clothes and belongings in Jersey. 
[00:32:00]  Uh-huh.  And I think the wife and the...  What's the matter, Opie?  You didn't even get to the funny part of the story.  Opie.  Is it the tapping fingers thing that's getting you?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I'm figuring it out.  I'm just not a nice person.  You're evil.  Oh, God.  I'm trying to show my nice side lately on this show, but it's tough. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Go ahead, Andrew.  I want to hear, Andrew.  I do.  Let her rip.  Um...  So, um...  I had to drive her out to Jersey to pick up her belongings.  And either her husband or whoever...  It was very uncomfortable.  Oh, what?  The husband was there.  She was leaving?  Yeah, pick up all her belongings, her bags, her belongings, everything. 
[00:33:00]  You were picking them up?  Well...  She was picking them up and I had to take her to Jersey and back to the Bronx.  What was she picking up?  Um...  All her belongings, bags and...  And the husband was there.  And he didn't want her leaving?  Belongings.  The belongings, yes.  He didn't want her leaving?  Was that it?  Um...  I don't know.  It was kind of uncomfortable.  I mean, it was kind of uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  I understand.  Were they arguing or no? 
[00:33:30]  A little bit.  I wasn't paying attention much.  Went to that special place mentally.  Uh-oh.  Are you a gentle giant?  Yes, I am.  Okay, good.  You look strong.  You're probably very strong.  It looks like you've got retard strength.  I wouldn't want to tell you.  He's got big forearms.  Yeah.  Is your orange to your liking?  It looks a little off still.  It looks kind of yellow and, uh...  John, it's, yeah, but that might just be the season.  Yeah, okay.  Travis has the camera today.  All right. 
[00:34:00]  Anyway, don't get nervous.  It's no big deal with the camera and stuff.  Yeah.  What's the ring on your finger?  You got a ring on your left pinky.  It's a class ring?  Oh, actually, I was, um, I was the head equipment manager of a football team in the Bronx, John  F. Kennedy Knights Football.  Oh, wow.  Awesome.  Equipment manager.  What does that entail?  Um, I guess, um, I'm taking equipment and, uh, and... 
[00:34:30]  Managing it?  Managing it.  Would you carry their belongings?  No, no, no.  They wouldn't shoot jock straps at you in the locker room or nothing, right?  Oh, no, definitely not, no.  No, no.  How about if you asked nice?  Would they have a football team in the Bronx?  Yes.  Yeah?  Must have been, uh, a good team.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, that year they were undefeated.  Uh-huh.  The coach gave the whole team of rings and watches. 
[00:35:00]  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Nice.  All pulled off of livery drivers.  Yeah.  Attacked.  I'm sure those are all in small manila envelopes waiting for their release.  Those little possessions.  All right.  There's a little bit more about Andrew, the cab driver from the Bronx.  Look at that.  Are you ready to do the news there, Andrew?  Okay.  Are you up on the news on a daily basis? 
[00:35:30]  I know a lot of cab drivers listen to the news stations.  Are you up on the news?  Oh, yeah, pretty much, yes.  You kind of know what's going on day to day?  Oh, yeah, pretty much.  I do.  All right.  That's good.  Keeps you educated.  All right.  Well, do we have our little ticker?  Yes, we do, Anthony.  We need the ticker.  Do you have like a nickname or anything, Andrew?  Oh. 
[00:36:00]  Friends of mine call me Big A.  Big A.  Yes.  The Big A.  Big A.  All right.  They call you Big A?  Yes.  That's funny because they say Jim has the Big A.  Why do they call you Big A?  Um, I guess because I'm tall.  And his name would be, um, yeah.  It's with A and Big.  Big A.  Oh, okay.  Yo, Big A.  We need some more helmets over here. 
[00:36:30]  Something like that.  Big A.  Hand me that piano.  And you say your friends call you this?  Um, yes.  Uh, you hang out with your friends, what, on weekends and stuff?  Um, sometimes.  Yeah?  Yes.  Guys you've known a while or?  Yeah, a long time, yes.  Yeah.  Is the tapping thing like an OCD thing?  Just asking.  Geez.  Well, how about your fumbling?  Is that a...  Oh!  I like you, Andrew. 
[00:37:00]  You got a set of balls.  You got some set of balls.  I like that.  Oh, Andy.  Are you going to take that?  What's the world coming to?  He fights back.  I like that in a person.  Now, I've admitted I got OCD stuff going on.  Okay.  Don't hand him the poker chips, you sadistic son of a bitch.  He gives me the poker chips that they've been trying to keep away from me for months.  No, is it, though?  Seriously, I know a little bit about OCD, and it looks like you're tapping out on some 
[00:37:30]  kind of pattern there.  Is it a pattern, or he's just kind of finding the words and tapping, a little nervous?  Or is it like, yeah, you're trying to find a rhythm?  Because sometimes I do that with my foot.  That's the tapping you hear in the background sometimes.  Yeah.  That's not distracting.  Sometimes he does it with a yogurt spoon and a yogurt container.  Jimmy's much worse about that than me.  I swear to God.  You put it right on the mic and go, on purpose.  All right.  Well, very good, Andrew.  I like someone that fights back. 
[00:38:00]  You ready for the news?  Thanks, baby.  Of course, yes.  Oh, Jesus.  What a terrible Jimmy.  You're going to get some kind of sexual harassment lawsuit against you from a guy.  That's going to make some great headlines.  Thanks, sweetie.  Right.  Cutie pie.  All right.  Here we go.  Start to teletype.  With the news, it's the big A.  Stroller saves baby and west side collapse. 
[00:38:30]  A supermarket under demolition collapsed onto upper west side pedestrians yesterday.  Among the five injured was the seven-month-old Abigail Lewinsky, who was seated in an urban double-mounted buggy.  What caused the collapse?  Just read the news.  They don't. 
[00:39:00]  You ever watch the news, Jimmy?  They don't all of a sudden ask the anchor questions like that.  That's our part.  Just let the guy do the news.  And then we talk about it.  I'm not going to comment.  I'm letting Big A read the news.  Well, it was a big story in New York yesterday.  Andrew seemed very informed.  He may have read the article and maybe had some answers.  A whole building collapsed and this baby was saved because of the stroller the baby was in.  Right.  And that same stroller was recalled the day before, by the way.  Because it's dangerous.  Because it's dangerous. 
[00:39:30]  And it saved the case.  Hold on a second.  Sorry.  What do you need, Sam?  He's asking me for my password for my computer.  Why?  Can we get this off air?  Why would you want his password?  They want me doing feedback in the office because the monitor's out in the cubicles.  Does one of them have the password while we're in the middle of this?  No?  No.  Ben said he knew it was something.  But he didn't know.  Totally what it was.  He told me to come in here and write you a little note.  All right.  This ain't going to distract the flow of the show or anything.  All right.  We'll wait for Jim to give the password out. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, and now the teletype stopped.  This is great.  We're in the middle of a bit.  We're doing stuff.  We're doing something.  What a bad position he's put in.  Sorry, guys.  Ben tells him to do something.  All right.  Don't.  Anyway.  All right.  We're talking to Big A.  Big A's doing the news here.  So that's pretty much the story.  The building collapsed and this baby was saved.  I don't know how many people were injured or anything.  You know, it's not on your sheet. 
[00:40:30]  How many of you think were injured, Big A?  It's not going to be on the paper.  Wow.  You know, you don't know.  Prepare that news.  I don't know.  No.  You don't know?  No.  But the baby was saved by the stroller, I think, right?  Yeah.  And that stroller was recalled the day before for being dangerous.  Are you serious?  I swear to God.  That's pretty much it.  That's the little cute twist in the story.  Wow.  That Andrew didn't have.  Maybe it causes building collapses.  There you go.  Your stroller causing building collapses? 
[00:41:00]  I'll wait for the new news teases that we got.  Maybe we'll do it right after the news here.  All right.  Go ahead, Big A.  Next story.  Okay.  Next is Frank Quest.  I'm not going to quit.  Chief Justice William Frank Quest said last night he will stay on the Supreme Court as  long as my health permits. 
[00:41:30]  My health won't allow it.  No.  My hands won't allow it.  Okay.  Continue.  All right.  Frank Quest released the statement hours after being released from an Arlington, Virginia  hospital after being treated for two days with a fever.  He got the fever.  Nice.  Very good.  That was informative.  He had a tough time with that story, though. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  He did a good job.  Why did he have a fever, though?  Did I say what was wrong with him finally?  Because I did hear the news today.  And do you know what he's responsible for?  He's got the thyroid.  He's got the thyroid.  He's got the thyroid cancer.  Do you know anything about him?  He's the Chief Justice.  Ah.  Very good.  All right.  He is.  All right.  Way to look deep into the story.  I like this kid, Big A.  Yeah.  We like Big A. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  The next is topless and proud of it.  Oh.  You're sexy.  This is a sexy story.  Sexy.  Um, Cameron Diaz testified yesterday.  Um, she doesn't regret posing topless for pictures as a 19-year-old unknown.  Um, in fact, I thought my boobs looked good, she said, but denied she ever signed away her rights 
[00:43:00]  to those racy shots.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Diaz, 32.  Yeah.  Ah, more.  Diaz, 32, took center stage in a criminal trial against photographer John the Buddha.  Photographer.  Photographer.  Photographer.  No, it's photographer.  Photographer, Ovi. 
[00:43:30]  I've said photographer many times.  It's not like that.  It kind of throws you for a little.  It sounded good to me, man.  Yeah.  Photographer.  So what's this story about there, Andrew?  Um, John the Buddha, who was accused of forging the actress's signature on an authorization  release in a bid to pump $3 million out of her.  Ah, whew.  That's, uh, yeah, I remember seeing, I saw those pictures. 
[00:44:00]  You ever see them?  She's, uh, topless, wearing some kind of leather thing, and it's a little S&M looking.  No?  No?  You ever saw it?  Yeah.  You found them online.  No, I did not.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we move on with the news with the big A?  Actor Brad Pitt released from Los Angeles Hospital.  So, um, films star Brad Pitt was released on Wednesday.  Wow, that's a tough one, right? 
[00:44:30]  That was a little weird.  I'm noticing that S-T, uh, words really kind of throw you for a loop, don't they?  But he tapped four times before he said start.  You guys found that out, huh?  Yeah, the S-Ts are a little, uh.  It's all about the S-T?  Yeah, it's the S-T.  Can we get one of those?  Well, the S's and S-Ts.  S-Ts are the rough ones.  As a start or any part of a word?  The beginning.  The beginning.  Yeah.  Mostly.  The start.  That's no big deal.  It's not like there's a lot of S-T words in the English language.  No. 
[00:45:00]  Jesus.  Let's get a tongue twister with the S-Ts.  Is there one out there?  Or maybe the listeners can come up with a quick one on instant feedback.  Yeah, it's the S-T thing, huh?  An S-T tongue twister.  How about start, step, stop?  Oh.  You're trying to kill me now, huh?  Yeah.  He's trying to kill me.  I just didn't even notice anything going on.  All right, let's get back to the Brad Pitt story.  He's a big, uh, movie, movie, um, celebrity. 
[00:45:30]  Celebrity.  Celebrity.  That's great.  All right, yeah, keep going.  Brad Pitt was released on Wednesday from a Los Angeles hospital where he had been admitted  for a flu-like illness that turned out to be viral energitis, his spokesman said. 
[00:46:00]  No further information about his condition was offered.  Good for him.  He's out.  A lot of people were worried.  Went over there to Africa.  God, our listeners come up with the lines we should be coming up with.  Go ahead, Earl.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, is that a, is that a news picker or his teeth chattering? 
[00:46:30]  That could be long.  Oh.  That's good.  Wow.  Very good.  All right, uh, back to the news, uh, teletype there, yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Um.  We're almost done, right?  Woods leads British Open by one stroke.  Tiger Woods was positioning himself to win another British Open at St. Andrews. 
[00:47:00]  Woods claimed his first Open title in, uh, 2000 at the old course, and he was one stroke  ahead of Mark Hensby after a six under, sixty, six, in the first round Thursday.  Ah.  A little bit more about that story, uh, Tiger Woods also admitted that his mom was like  a block away from one of those, uh, subway bombings in London.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that, that came out, uh, yesterday during, I guess, his press conference. 
[00:47:30]  Playing on the links of St. Andrews.  He invented the game, you know, called it golf without the L.  Yeah.  All right.  Continue there, Andrew.  Very famous golfer.  Uh, save the news, uh, he's gonna do another news report.  What's this?  Oh.  Oh, a tongue twister.  All right.  Do you want to do the tongue twister now or his next story? 
[00:48:00]  Let's see this one.  Yeah, let's do the tongue twister first.  Where's Steve?  Let's get Steve in here because he has perfect diction.  Yeah.  So we can get the, uh, the contrast here.  You gonna be a good sport and try this, uh, Big A?  Um, of course.  Okay.  Wow.  This, I, I, I can't even do this.  I know.  That's why we need, uh, Martini Steve.  We're admitting this is tough to say.  It's Martini Steve.  All right.  Uh.  I don't hear that anymore.  I know.  We, we rarely ever do. 
[00:48:30]  It's Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  What's up, Steve?  What's up, fellas?  Here it is.  Here's my copy.  The yin and yang right here.  This is an ST tongue twister.  Physically, they could be twins.  Yeah.  As far as speech goes, they couldn't be further apart.  I, I would, I would hesitate to agree with you there.  I know you would.  I would hesitate.  Believe me, Andrew's not jumping up to be happy with my comparison either.  All right, Steve. 
[00:49:00]  A skunk sat on a stump and thunk the stunk stunk.  Bleh.  Fuck off.  That is, see, Steve can't even do this.  The words are pronounced properly.  That's a hard one.  A skunk.  Uh, but the stump thunk the skunk stunk.  Six sticky sucker sticks.  Strict, strict, strong, stringy, Stephen Stretch.  Six sticky sucker sticks.  What's wrong with you?  Six sticky sucker sticks.  What did I do wrong with? 
[00:49:30]  Six sticky sucker sticks.  Six, a skunk sat on a stump and thunk the stump stunk.  But the stump thunk the skunk stunk.  You got the inflection.  All right.  And six sticky sucker sticks.  And strict, strong, stringy, Stephen Stretch.  Forget these guys.  Let's get Boston here to do one of these.  Oh, God.  We need wetsuits.  Snorkels.  And half of it will be just because you didn't know what the words were.  Bravo to Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, thank you.  Now throw the word finger in there and see if you can redo that.  She said, bring her my finger.  Bring her my finger.  Take your finger and linger longer.  Finger.  I say it right now.  Finger.  I know because I think linger in my head.  Finger.  That was the biggest laugh during the replay yesterday.  That whole finger thing was hilarious.  All right.  Let's go with the big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Let's rip with the first one. 
[00:50:30]  A skunk sat on a stump.  And thunk was...  Stump was...  Stunk.  Oh, baby. 
[00:51:00]  Stump, thwart, thunk, skunk, skunk, skunk.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I am perspiring over here.  It was good, actually.  Holy shit.  During the replay, listen really closely to him tapping the paper.  Oh, I know.  He tapped it about ten times before he could get to...  I forget which ST word.  That ST is really a bitch. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  That just hangs you up.  Is there...  Has anybody ever told you what that is?  No?  You've never been to a speech therapist or when you were a kid or something?  When I was a kid and also in junior high school, but nothing after that.  They never told you, like, this is this problem, they have a name for it, and it's called, you  know, the STs or something, or not, nothing.  No? 
[00:52:00]  STD.  STD.  Listen to this line.  Paul in Northport.  Go ahead, Paul.  So, apparently, Andrew has a problem with STs, and Jimmy has a problem with STDs.  Ah, yes.  I just said STDs before.  I know.  This is a new character.  It's three seconds too late, guy.  I didn't see it, or I would have said it as you said it.  Uh, all right.  Let's say how to jury in Miami.  Here you go.  Stella stared stoically at the stoplight.  Stella stared stoically at the stoplight. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Can you say that?  That's one.  No?  Don't you want to try that one?  All right.  We'll come up with another ST tongue twister before the end of the show today.  How about the last one on the list?  The, uh...  Oh, I thought he was done.  No, strict, strong, stringy, Stephen Stretch.  I thought it was...  Oh, I thought it was done also.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Give it a shot there.  The last one.  Give that, yeah, strict, strong, stringy one. 
[00:53:00]  Strict, strong, stringy, Stephen Stretch.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't seem like the STRs are as much of a problem for you as just the STs.  Like, stump is pretty hard.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's very hard.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to the news.  That's something.  That's right.  Fascinating by this.  All right.  Back to the news with the big A. 
[00:53:30]  Um, the medical examiner's office...  I hope...  I hope they say Stella Stevens is dead.  No?  That's what the medical examiner's office...  No, actually, she just had a stroke.  Oh, it's Stoughton.  All right.  Let her rip.  All right.  Sorry.  Is she...  Oh, yes, Jeremy? 
[00:54:00]  Is she in St-Vincent?  Yeah, take a little drink of water there, big A.  Yeah, as you drink the water, let's go to the phones and talk to Buddy Hinton.  Buddy Hinton.  Hey, Buddy!  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's no wonder you can walk.  That's not rules. 
[00:54:30]  Baby talk.  All right.  Here we go.  Buddy Hinton.  Is this the last...  I think this is the last story, right?  You stop that, Buddy Hinton.  For this hour?  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  The medical...  The sheriff's office ruled the July 2nd death of a man in South King County was accidental.  The man apparently died after having sex with a horse. 
[00:55:00]  Whoa.  Here's a funny story.  The sheriff's office detectives believe the council took place near a farm in unincorporated  King County.  Oh, shit.  It's going to be a fucking holiday inn.  There's a fourth floor walk-up in Brown Heights.  All right.  Go ahead.  Bestiality is not a crime in Washington. 
[00:55:30]  It's not?  No.  Hats off to Washington.  Get those bags packed, folks.  Take this show on the road.  I'm going to watch Andrew rape a little piggy.  Just a little one.  Again.  Just hold it.  So, if they call from Washington, we could have girls having sex with dogs and stuff  on our show?  Is it Washington State or is it D.C.?  Not D.C. 
[00:56:00]  Andrew, can you sing or anything like that?  Someone's asking if you could sing.  Actually, I do karaoke.  Not often, but I do karaoke.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We need a karaoke machine.  Someone get a karaoke machine to 111 57th Street immediately.  What song?  What do you sing?  What do you sing?  Yeah.  Everyone has that song they always pick on the karaoke machine. 
[00:56:30]  That's true.  Which one is yours?  I usually pick.  What though do I pick?  A lot of.  Damn.  Now I forgot.  Like, God, I can't even remember what I sing now.  Andrew, what song do you sing?  I swear to God, she was moving when I left her.  I sing Neil Diamond.  This is why Eric is part of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh?  Because we abuse him on a daily basis.  We?  I came from Danny.  Look at Danny doing his bagel just going, yeah, me. 
[00:57:00]  No, it was me.  Where do we get this, though?  Tis it.  It doesn't matter where we got it.  Well, it matters that Danny gets the credit.  That's right.  He's got a bunch of karaoke songs.  Stop it.  We got, like, 15 choices.  And we could have Andrew pick one, maybe work on it in the other studio.  Wow.  And he comes back and does it for everybody.  How's that sound, Andrew?  Okay.  All right.  Let me see the songs.  What do we got here?  I Love Rock and Roll, Joan Jett.  Reeling in the Years, Steely Dan.  Waiting for a Girl Like You, Foreigner. 
[00:57:30]  What would you say your range is?  You sound actually like you have a pretty high voice.  He should do Waiting for a Girl Like You.  Yeah.  All Right Now from Free.  Got a little BTO, Taking Care of Business.  Brown Eyed Girl.  Always from Bon Jovi.  Blaze of Glory from Bon Jovi.  Born to be Wild is, you know, standard.  That could be a good one.  Fleetwood Mac.  Do we have lyrics here?  Yeah, we can print those up, right?  Yep.  November Rain, maybe.  A little Guns and Roses.  Paradise City. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, there's quite a few choices there from quite a few genres.  Whatever it wants.  Stand by me.  You know, this horse.  Oh, Stan.  Be by me.  Be by me.  When you're weak.  I think any one of these songs will be radio gold, so.  Oh, yeah.  We'll give him the CD, and he'll pick the song he wants.  Pick a song.  Let him be comfortable with it.  I'm hoping he does Waiting for a Girl Like You or Born to be Wild. 
[00:58:30]  Born to be Wild, I think, could be the hit.  That's a good one.  I think we could work that to mainstream radio if you do a good job with that.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  This horse story sounds a little interesting, huh?  People are suggesting, yes, Stairway to Heaven.  Spying.  Spying.  An escalator.  But this horse story.  So what?  The guy had sex with a horse?  Sex with a horse, and he died?  Of what?  A heart attack or something?  A kick? 
[00:59:00]  What did he have?  Did you read that whole story there, Andrew?  Big A?  Sorry.  Big A.  He's reading it now.  No cause of death?  No cause of death?  No cause, no.  All right.  We'll find out.  Wow.  All right.  I guess that's it for the news.  Yeah, that's a great job, by the way.  Here, take the karaoke CD, Big A.  What song do you think you want to do right off the bat? 
[00:59:30]  You know those songs on there?  At least a few of them.  We'll get them the lyrics, familiar enough with the way they go?  A little bit.  Yeah?  You've heard them on the radio and stuff.  Oh, of course.  So you're kind of familiar.  It wouldn't be like you're trying to put words to a song you have no idea.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, it's the Big A, everyone.  Big A.  I say he does Born to Me Wild.  You think?  What do you think? 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Is that the one?  I mean, it's kind of the one.  It's kind of hack, Born to Me Wild.  Yeah, but a version with Big A can be pretty funny.  I think I like the foreigner one, though.  A girl like you was a good choice.  Yeah?  All right, yeah.  It's not going to trip him up there.  It's a lot of range on that one.  Yeah, he'll do fine.  All right, let's do Waiting for a Girl Like You.  Like, almost anyone could do Born to Me Wild.  It's just a matter of yelling it out.  You can do that gruff bond.  Yeah.  Waiting for a Girl Like You would take some vocal styling.  Would show his softer side, I think.  Right.  Which would be very nice.  It's because you are looking for a woman.  Every psychopath has a soft side. 
[01:00:30]  Someone's suggesting that he should sing Starry Starry Night.  It's not cloudy.  It's not cloudy.  Wow.  We like this Andrew guy.  All right, Andrew.  He's a good boy.  Good job.  You can leave the studio there.  Investigating the owner of an area farm, Seattle man died from injuries sustained while having  sex with a horse.  Wow, the horse beat the shit out of him.  Boarded on the property. 
[01:01:00]  Okay.  A death was accidental and the result of having sex with a horse.  Surveillance camera picked up a license plate of the car that dropped the man off at the  hospital.  Trying to see what the...  Investigators found chickens, goats, and sheep on the property.  They're looking into whether animal cruelty, which is a crime, was committed by having  sex with these smaller, weaker animals.  That horse did not want to be fucked.  No shit, Sherlock.  That's great. 
[01:01:30]  No shit.  How would you feel?  You're pulling a carriage around all day, people are bugging you, and then all of a sudden,  uh-oh.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Like, I don't give enough to these people.  And the cue to the horse was, like, every time he sees the guy walking in with the little  stepping stool.  No.  No.  Dude, he is not bringing that in to brush my back.  Because the other horses, like, are looking at him from across the stool, and they all  just start to avoid eye contact when they're watching with the stool.  Oh, is that awful?  They're all eating oats, and he's just got to stand there with a little tear down the 
[01:02:00]  side of his long face.  Why the long face?  Why the long face?  I was right there.  He, uh...  Yeah.  Oh.  He, uh...  I would gather he probably got kicked.  Oh, that's great.  Probably got kicked right in the body there and just busted something open.  What else could happen while you're having sex with a horse?  You just hear, uh, Dune.  Uh, Dune.  Dune.  All right, um...  I'm not going to erase him.  I'm just going to fuck him everything.  And the Godfather didn't kill him. 
[01:02:30]  He committed suicide.  I was going to make him a big star.  Oh, star me up would be another good one for...  Yes, for Andrew.  Okay.  This is Big A.  Oh, sorry.  This is Big A.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Uh, uh...  Now s...  Now s... 
[01:03:00]  Now s...  Now s...  Stop s...  Having at me and s...  All the rest of...  Opie and Anthony.  XM Thriller.  A 24-7 channel.

I'm Glenn Yunus with your XM Sports Nation College Basketball Minute.  Three, two, one.  Dogs do the improbable, the unthinkable, the unbelievable. 
[01:06:00]  They beat Arkansas and go wire to wire to win the SEC tournament.  The undermanned and relocated Georgia Bulldogs  win the SEC in surprise fashion over Arkansas on Sunday.  It was a fantastic game.  Your number one seeds handed out.  Your brackets filled out.  Number one as follows.  The North Carolina Tar Heels, the number one overall,  followed by Memphis, UCLA, and Kansas.  All those teams, winners of their conference championship.  As for your number two seeds in the NCAAs, 
[01:06:30]  Tennessee, Texas, Georgetown, and the Blue Devils of Duke.  Maybe a small snub.  The Wisconsin Badgers, they get in.  They win the Big Ten tournament, but they're only a three seed.  And that's the XM Sports Nation College Basketball Minute.  The early season predictions don't matter.  The trades that were made or not made, they don't matter.  The schedule, the overtime losses, the shot that rang the goal post  and bounced out and not in, none of that matters.  Nobody cares. 
[01:07:00]  It's all about here and now.  And right here, right now, there are only three words that you need to worry about.  Three words that matter.  Just win, baby.  The push to the playoffs.

[01:07:30]  and he never taught me anything.  But still I slap my chest and sing of my drunk and Irish dad.  Oh, his face looks like a railroad map  and he never shuts his friggin' trap.  But all the ladies catch the clap  from your drunken Irish dad.  Ask a Hennessy, Tennessee, Morrison, Shaughnessy,  Riven and Rooney, they'll tell you the same.  McNulty, Mulrooney and Cotter and Clooney  all feel the same mixture of pride and of shame.  Finnegan, Hannigan, Kelly and Flanagan  look to the ground when their dad passes by.  Caverty, Rafferty, Joyce and Olafferty  fight for his honor and then start to cry.  Oh, we Irish lads are all infirm 
[01:08:00]  and our moods infect us like a jerk  cause we're all the spawn of a pickled sperm  and we don't tan well either  from a drunken Irish dad.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let this show die then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  They should be shot. 
[01:08:30]  All right, let's get Andrew in here, guys.  All right.  Here he comes into the studio.  Yeah.  The big A, Andrew.  Our latest creation, Anthony.  A lot of instant feedback coming in.  Oh, that is...  That's piercing.  That like annoys the crap out of me,  that little whistling song.  It's from Kill Bill.  But...  Oof.  Wow, Pat from Menaki.  I didn't know he wrote this feedback.  Andrew's a star. 
[01:09:00]  This just in.  Pat from Menaki is on suicide watch.  Aw.  Oh.  Did I say something wrong?  No, I'm wondering.  I didn't recognize the name.  What?  Oh.  Oh.  Very good.  All right, Andrew.  How are you?  Huh?  Okay.  Okay.  Ah.  We heard you did a pretty good job  practicing your Waiting for a Girl Like You song.  I was trying.  Yeah?  How do you think you did? 
[01:09:30]  Not that great.  Not that great?  But you said you did karaoke before.  In a karaoke bar, was it?  We never really got into that.  Or at a party?  Oh, no, no, no.  I had a karaoke bar.  Karaoke bar.  And you were there with your friends?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  And did they put you up to it?  Or you just figured you'd get up there and sing a tune? 
[01:10:00]  Because that's kind of a ballsy thing.  A lot of people get scared to get up in front of people.  And you seem like a shy guy.  A little shy.  Yeah?  Well, actually, most of the time I do karaoke, you know, of course, in a bar, you're drinking  and it gives you a little coverage.  Ah, that's true.  Very good.  It loosens you up a little bit.  You've got to love alcohol.  Do you talk normal when you're drunk?  A little better.  A little better? 
[01:10:30]  A lot of times.  Wow.  You're not as nervous, right?  Of course not.  We got rid of the Jaeger machine.  No shit.  What?  But I sure enjoy doing a radio show.  Yeah.  What is your favorite song to sing during karaoke?  My Generation by The Who?  Anything my Nell tell us?  Actually, I usually sing songs. 
[01:11:00]  There's a singer called Andrew Gold.  Andrew Gold?  Oh, Lonely Boy, right?  Yes.  Yeah, sure.  You know that one?  Dude, I've had it spin this crap.  Are you a lonely boy in Andrew?  That would be a perfect one for him to do.  Is that one?  The next time you come in, Andrew, we'll have you do a Lonely Boy.  We'll get that karaoke.  All right, give me a Lonely Boy.  Andrew Gold.  You know the song, right, Dan?  Yeah, I'm trying to remember how it goes, though.  That's not helping. 
[01:11:30]  I know.  You know the song.  It was a huge hit.  Oh, it's like...  Yeah, can you get the Greg and Tony show thing, too?  People request that.  Please.  All right, hit Lonely Boy.  This thing.  Oh, of course.  You know the words, right?  Yeah?  Right.  You've done this karaoke? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I have.  Yeah?  All right, sing along with Andrew Gold there.  He was born on a summer day in 1951.  One.  One.  And with the slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son.  His mother and father said, what a lovely boy.  We'll teach him what we learned.  Oh, yes, just what we learned.  We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school. 
[01:12:30]  It'll teach him how to fight to be.  Do you know this part?  Oh, what a lonely boy.  Oh, what a lonely boy.  What a lonely boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Never heard karaoke done like that before.  Vocal stylings.  Where you just kind of choose a word every once in a while.  Andrew was anticipating the word. 
[01:13:00]  They'd go, and a girl, and he'd go, and boy.  Yeah.  Greatest song ever.  Eric, write a note for yourself.  I want that on my replay.  And I want the other one about, you know, suck my fucking cock.  I want that.  Thank you.  All right.  Are you ready for the news, Andrew? 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  More news?  Yeah.  More news with the big A.  In our fess.  Fess.  Fess.  You want to run a fess?  Hey, fess.  Hi, fess.  Fess.  All right.  Whenever you're ready.  I don't think we're going to go with the teletype so we can hear every nuance of your speech impediment.  Go ahead, Andrew.  The big A.  Man saw it in bombing probe arrested.  Police on Friday arrested an Egyptian biochemist saw it in the probe into the London bombings, 
[01:14:00]  a government official said.  Magdi El-Nashara was arrested in Cairo early Friday, an official said,  and was being interrogated by Egyptian authorities. 
[01:14:30]  You are a kid toucher!  Metropolitan Police in London said a man has been arrested in Cairo but would not confirm his name  or caratize him as a suspect.  Okay.  Terrific.  Well, what him as a subject? 
[01:15:00]  I didn't hear him.  Sorry, buddy.  Caratize.  I didn't hear him.  I know I missed.  No, actually, I didn't hear it.  You turned someone into a carrot.  You caratize them.  Just the last sentence.  I'm sorry.  I actually just missed it because I was...  But would not confirm his name of caratize him as... 
[01:15:30]  No, caratize.  It's a machine bunnies have been working on.  Oh, good Lord.  Get me my carrotizer.  I know what the word was.  It was a...  Oh, God. 
[01:16:00]  I get nervous.  This show is ridiculous!  Yeah.  Fucking drone men.  Bart jokes.  Oh, awful.  Horrid.  Let's say hi to Brian in Alabama.  Brian?  Alabama man!  Alabama man!  Go ahead, Brian.  Hey, I was just wondering, could somebody take a steak knife and clean my ears out?  This guy here is worse than listening to me on the radio. 
[01:16:30]  I don't think so.  All right.  You're sadly mistaken.  Thank you.  A lot of people saying the Greg and Tony show theme sounds like Andrew.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Greg and Tony show.  All right.  If you will, Andrew.  Good night.  Bye.  Better back.  Better have.  All right.  All right.  On with the news with the big A.  Another story.  Andrew, what, of Arabia?  Okay.

[01:19:30]  received scams were prescribed for prescription drug offers, financing services, phishing emails, and pornographic.

[01:36:00]  and there was a  black miedo  hunting and a  laden  ground  and then  the  key  and like brahimoviga  the  fire  some  How'd you find my way, now that I'm on all my own? 
[01:36:30]  Saw you just the other day, my, have you grown?  And my memory back there, Lord, sometime I overcome thinking about you  You, my brown-eyed girl  You, my brown-eyed girl  Remember, when we sing 
[01:37:00]  When we sing  Sha-la-la-la-la-la  La-la-la  Sha-la-la-la-la-la  La-la-la  La-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
[01:37:30]  I fucking suck.  All right, calm down, Andrew.  Jesus, it wasn't that bad.  Wait, why didn't you hear that?  What did he say?  That was his inner voice there.  Well, that was nice. 
[01:38:00]  I liked the faster tempo there.  I liked it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked a lot of times  until you chopped the unnecessary lyrics.  And you just kind of came in with, girl.  It's overrated singing the whole song.  I like the parts, actually,  where he would sing the line  before it even came out.  Yeah.  Like, before you were actually able to,  you kind of got a little ahead of the lyrics.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  That's good, though.  All right.  Well, great job.  Great appearance. 
[01:38:30]  Great appearance, Andrew.  Excellent job.  Look forward to having you back again  at some point on the program.  There's right now a van in Munaki  headed towards a brick wall.  Yeah.  His last crash.  Eh, eh.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Meh, eh.  I think this is what we're going to do with Andrew next.  We're going to do movie scenes.  Yeah.  We're going to, you know,  team you up with, like,  Stalker Patty.  Yeah, it needs somebody for him to work again.  Maybe Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Maybe, uh, Marion.  Pat from Munaki.  Andrew, a yuck.  The Lady Di.  Isn't that great?  Hey, how are you, Andrew? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, but we'll do that next on the show.  Movie scenes.  Famous movie scenes done by these guys.  All right.  Andrew, good job.  Excellent.  We'll see you soon, okay, buddy?  Hey, this is Sean William Scott.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Mondays are reserved for Artist Confidential on Channel 2, XMX.  It's back-to-back Artist Confidentials today from two bands that completely rock.  They rocked decades ago, and they're still amazing today and coming up with new material. 
[01:39:30]  First, it's Ann Wilson and Hart, and then Duran Duran.  Again, they're both back-to-back all day long right now on Channel 2.  XM's exclusive music.  Channel 2.  XMX.  Welcome to the Esquire Minute.  I'm Andy Langer.  Every year around this time, we offer up our alternative Oscars, offering praise for the overlooked,  censure for the overpraised.  It's a celebration of last year's most relevant, astonishing, and underappreciated achievements,  or whatever struck us as funny. 
[01:40:00]  No Country for Old Men and Grindhouse took home awards, as did Marissa Tomei in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.  The award?  Best Gratuitous Nudity.  Actresses tend to be more willing to get naked on screen when they're young, unknown, and hungry.  Lately, though, there's been an influx of long-established celebrities who suddenly become allergic to clothes as they hit middle age.  Meg Ryan, in the cut.  Jennifer Aniston, as close as she's ever come in the breakup.  And now Tomei, who spends much of this new heist-gone-wrong picture parading around topless for no particular reason. 
[01:40:30]  Not only does she look delectable at 43, but her casual exposure gives this contrived and glibly cynical film a disarming frankness that it desperately needs.

What does the tiny bumblebee bat have in common with the pygmy hippopotamus?  Not much, but both these creatures happen to be included on a list of the world's top 100 endangered and most unusual animals. 
[01:41:00]  The list has been compiled by scientists at the Zoological Society of London,  who say these genetically distinct and rare animals have few close relatives and could go extinct immediately.  The London scientists say conservation efforts mostly ignore these weird but endangered creatures,  and they hope to fix that by focusing new attention on them.  But in at least one case, it may already be too late. 
[01:41:30]  In China, the Yangtze dolphin, number one on the list, may already have died out forever.  To find out more about your world, come to NationalGeographic.com.  What's on my XM?  XM.

Debuts April 1st on XM 17.  The E-N-E Show.  Lad, it's your duty to find you a lass with child-bearing hips in a pink suplass. 
[01:43:30]  And make her your wife and lover with love so true.  Now some rivers run high, some rivers run low.  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow.  When it's called menstruation, here's what it means to you.  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first.  Stand back, her ovarian dam's gonna burst.  Son, don't be afraid.  It's a natural thing.  Just wad up some cotton in hand or a string. 
[01:44:00]  And put the old linens on top of the bed.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  Hundreds of years old.  That's why bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain her water, her breasts will be tender.  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want to make love if you do. 
[01:44:30]  You're a fool.  You'll only end up with a bloody old tool.  Now get out of the house, go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins.  But son, it'll taste like some old rusty coins.  So turn off the light and take off your hat and drop to your knees.  Say a prayer to St. Pat that'll give you the strength to get out of the bed.  And for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead.  I feel a solo coming on. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, really?  Perhaps right here, Anthony.  Very good.  Now the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting  When the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeding  The Catholic, the Protestant, even the pagan  The pub is the place when your lady is ragging  So drink of your pint, boys, and thank your shamrocks  That as menfolk we don't have to bleed from our c*** 
[01:45:30]  And that we can escape from the lady in red  And get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead  Down to the old pub instead  Thank you, my lads  Thank you so much  Raise your glass  Funny good  You're listening to the worst  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  This is the f***ing worst of Opie and Anthony

Maybe it's the picture  It doesn't matter if she hears it now  Or 12 hours from now  That might be her ass  Why does she have hair like Anthony when you're five?

All right, you're chatting with her.  And then what happened?  How did you go private?  I just wanted to go private.  And we were talking. 
[01:56:30]  And I just know.  It was being recorded.  I actually had a feeling.  It doesn't sound like you had a feeling.  But it was in your pants.  And you had no idea this was going on.  I heard you mention Pal Talk in Australia. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, then you kind of know it was you.  Hold on live for a second, Big A.  They could have fooled this guy with dugout Doris.  He still would have gone off.  We're only halfway down and we got Richard Dreyfuss coming in.  So let's get to the next clip.  He eats up more.  She laughs once.  And then it ends and says, going in for round four.

[01:58:00]  So that your cock is sliding back and forth between my fingers.  And my lips are sliding on the shaft as well.  And every time I pull back a little.  Flicking back and forth over the eye of your cock.  Mmm.  That would make me so hot.  Like I'm hot now.  I'm so hot.  My pussy is just so wet.

[01:59:30]  Holy crap.  Big A's having a hard time because he's got pal talk on on half of his screen and the  Qantas website on the other.  He's booking a flight as he's fucking jerking off.  Big A's a dirty talking hack, though.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Toots.  Take it all.  I want to cum on you.  Oh, shit. 
[02:00:00]  If beauty was a minute, you'd be an hour.  Take my hot cum.  A lot of people saying you have balls calling in the program today, Big A.  Hey, I want to be mad about it.  A man has to do what a man has to do.  Right.  None of how humiliating.  That means there's going to be a fire at the studio entrance door.  Now, Big A, here's the big question.  And you know there's no lying or denying because the truth will come out. 
[02:00:30]  Is there video, and what are you doing in this video?  I guess you already know already.  I guess there is video, all right?  No, but the video is en route.  It's on its way, so we haven't seen it yet, but is it graphic?  Yes.  It's graphic. 
[02:01:00]  So you took the camera and pointed it at your dick.  Oh, yes.  And you were jacking.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my goodness.  All right, hold on the line.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, I just wondered how you guys got the new Dateline online presence on.  Before the damn show even came out.  Sounds like Dateline audio, doesn't it?  All right, punch it out.  Love you guys.  Thank you, Bruce.  Who set this up?  I don't know. 
[02:01:30]  Who set you up, Big A?  You know yet?  Please, Angel.  Who?  Please.  Well, she was the girl, but did someone put her up to it?  That's right, Angel.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a whole crew of people that work on a lot of people.  Roach from Whackbag, what's up?  Well, I necessarily didn't put her up to it.  I'm just the one that edited the video.  Oh, you edited the video.  And the audio.  How long is the video? 
[02:02:00]  I haven't got all the video yet, but the audio was about 45 minutes.  Wow.  You had to edit it down, and it was about 10 minutes because there was a lot of stuttering.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  It says something here about a plug, a MySpace plug.  Yeah, the only reason I was sent the video, and I promised Blaise Angel that she would get a MySpace plug.  It's MySpace.com slash Blaise Angel. 
[02:02:30]  You spelled Blaise, B-L-A-I-Z-E?  Correct.  Blaise Angel.  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  All right.  Angel.  And believe it or not, she's actually from Australia.  Yeah, we got that.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah, cool.  Thank you, Roach.  Take it easy.  All right, there's the plug.  Everyone go check out Blaise Angel on MySpace.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Can we get to the part of the tape where you start getting Fetchy involved? 
[02:03:00]  Very good, bro.  Let's say hi to Colin in Connecticut.  Colin.  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  This is your old friend, Colin Cosell.  Nothing.  It sounded like, remember those little Trainables videos from a year ago?  Yeah.  Where the guy walks in on the little boy whose sheets are all sticky?  You've had a wet dream.  I'm all right and sticky.  Chester's Liver from Whackbag.com.  Is anyone else going to feel dumb if Big A is hung like a horse? 
[02:03:30]  Big A.  Big A.  Yes.  How do you think you look in the video?  You're sporting?  You're looking big?  Not that big because I really want to know soon enough, I guess.  Oh, wow.  He's a...  All right.  Colin.  Yes, sir.  Wait.  Hold on a minute.  Thumbs up?  Jimmy, you got the right DVD? 
[02:04:00]  Jimmy got the right DVD.  Yeah, it's fine.  Thank you very much.  Colin, I was going to have you do some Howard Cosell, do a little play-by-play to the video  there.  Oh, dude.  All right.  Put him on the spot.  You want me to come in and do that shit or do you...  Can you send it to me?  No, I was thinking just a quickie, like a little thing right now, just to hear the  Howard Cosell.  That's all.  He's got a gigantic, retarded, stuttering cock.  He's choking it ever so slowly, he's going to blow his chromosome-lacking load all over  his keyboards. 
[02:04:30]  There you go.  That's all I wanted.  Very nice.  Thank you, Colin.  Have a good one.  Come and see us sometime.  Let's say hi to Scotty.  Scotty, what's up?  Yo, man, this is wrong, man.  This is like a spring gobler strut, man, thinking he's going to get laid and then getting shot right  in the head.  Yeah.  Punching off.  All right.  We're stalling because we don't have enough time to do the next four clips.  Tomorrow, you got to remind us, though.  Tomorrow, we play the clip that's titled, She's Watching Him Jerk Off, Telling Him to  Go Faster, and She's Laughing Her Ass Off. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, come on.  That's where we're going to start tomorrow.  How about this?  Damn it.  You won't need to remind us.  That one we'll remember.  Yes.  All right.  She has a screaming orgasm.  Gets him to admit he's called Big A on Opie and Anthony like we couldn't figure that  out on our own.  And then finally, the grand finale tomorrow on the program, Big A has an orgasm.  No.  Is that on there?  Yeah.  His money shot is on there?  You're going to have to listen tomorrow.  We rarely tease, but seriously, we got to get some... 
[02:05:30]  Can't you just fast forward to the...  Oh, my goodness.  These motherfuckers saying we're not doing good radio?  Well, that's what we do now.  You wait until tomorrow.  Those are the crumbs you were talking about, Leslie?  Yeah.  Crumbs.  How about you start complimenting us a little bit?  Exactly.  Just a little bit.  Can do no right over here.  We can do no right.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, it sounds like Big A's getting fucking fresh. 
[02:06:00]  Fucking tissue box.  They're trying to have a conversation.  He's getting fucking fresh.  A lot of people asking if there's video of the girl.  Big A, is there video of the girl that was recorded or probably not, right?  Oh, she had no cam.  Only a mic.  So she wasn't even cammed up, and you cammed up and jacked for her.  You rookie.  Wow.  You are like the old people that get taken out of all their money through the scams on 
[02:06:30]  the internet.  That's what you did.  You got taken of your dignity.  That's not bad, though.  It's like I kind of like the fact that you're doing the same thing on Pal Talk that we're all  doing on Pal Talk.  Someone on Pal Talk says, one night in Big A, instead of one night in Paris.  One night in Big A.  Big A, you rule, man.  I try, you know.  All right.  Well, you're going to have to call the show tomorrow for part two of your phone sex slash  video sex. 
[02:07:00]  The next time he goes up, he's going to have backlighting.  He's going to have the room cleaned up, mood music.  Believe me, he'll jerk off on cam again.  He's a good boy.  This show is so messed up.  All right, Big A.  See you, sweetie.  All right.  You know something, Big A?  What worries me is how your mother is going to take this.  You don't have to tell her, Miss Ratchet.  We'll see you tomorrow, okay, Big A? 
[02:07:30]  I have to tinkle, Opie.  Yeah.  I got to take a leak.  Yeah.  All right.  Break.  Let's take a break.  Once again, we'll play part two tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't believe there's a money shot.  Is it good?  Is it good, man?  Steve was just like, Steve was listening to it next to me with headphones, and I have  never seen it.  Steve, to get horrified, is a lot.  So it's good, yeah.  That's really good.  Hey, this is a really funny phone call.  Really fast.  Melissa in Philly.  Melissa. 
[02:08:00]  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you boys know that was the first time ever you've had phone sex  on your show that I could not masturbate to.  What a letdown.  All right.  That's a little rough.  But we'll try again tomorrow.  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  Bye.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  So we got Lazlo in the studio to talk some tech stuff today.  Also, Big A phone sex.  Oh, God.  You want to get right to the Big A stuff?  Because we did tease that at the end of the show yesterday.  That's where we left off yesterday. 
[02:08:30]  Big A on Pal Talk.  Everyone knows what Pal Talk is now, right?  It's a little camera video conferencing thing that people get on.  And as they're chatting, in the old days, you just used to chat with text.  Now you've got a camera, and you can do that video conferencing with people.  I don't see any cameras up, man.  Are there any girls in the room?  And then if you hook up, well, I just got here.  Oh, okay.  If you hook up, then you go private.  You could take your conversation to a private room and get a little sexy and a little dirty. 
[02:09:00]  Saucy.  And he hooked up with some girl from Australia.  Blaze Angel.  Blaze Angel.  That's her MySpace.  Blaze Angel.  One word.  B-L-A-I-Z-E.  Angel.  Blaze Angel.  And he hooked up.  They went into the private room and started getting a little saucy with each other.  And Big A, he pulled it out and started jacking. 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  Boy.  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  And he started jacking, and she's talking dirty to him, and he's trying to talk dirty  to her, which is just hysterical.  What did he say at one point?  I hear my hot cum.  Yeah, I want my hot cum on you.  Does the accent...  Does her accent add anything to it?  Because chicks with British and Australian accents always sound hotter than they are. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  She sounds pretty hot.  She doesn't have that heavy an accent.  Right.  Which is a little odd.  And Steve has seen the video.  Now, you have the video.  Yeah.  Can we play it in here?  Can we play it in here?  We all want to see the video at the same time.  No one has seen the actual video in this room, right?  No.  Because I want to get the natural reaction when we see Big A whacking it for the first time.  I think what I can do is put it on a thing.  Upload it somewhere, and then give us the secret URL.  Oh, there it is.  Stupid volume.  Yeah, I think I'll put it somewhere and just give Eric where it is. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  That'll work.  You can actually see it, myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  No, Jimmy.  No, you can't.  You can't.  It's all Big A jerk-off material.  Whoring ass.  No, I wouldn't lie.  All right, here.  You would.  You do.  So here we go.  We got to play just the first part of the first clip because it's one of the funniest moments  in Opie and Anthony history.  Yeah.  I don't know if it'll do it justice to hear it for the second time, but just listen to  this.  This is when we discover that Big A is about to have phone slash video pal talk sex with 
[02:11:00]  a girl from Australia.  Dirty boy.  Say, you want to play dirty with you here in the room with me?  You want to take a fake talk for me so if I can run for you and make you come?  Is that it?  Is that what you want?  I'm scared.  Let's go see with you.  Yeah, it's kind of like fun to me.  Why don't you come up and show me what you've got? 
[02:11:30]  It's like when you first started making international phone calls.  There's like that long delay.  Yeah.  That's okay with you.  It's like he's jerking off in the field in northern Iraq.  I want to come on your face.  Over.  Big A is the only one that can pull off an international phone call because the delay doesn't affect  the delay.  We're here in Baghdad. 
[02:12:00]  Auto delay.  That's great.  So we played a bunch of these clips.  Back to you, Wolf.  On yesterday's show.  We stopped yesterday just at the point where, let's see, she, all right, heats up more,  she laughs once, and then it then says going in for round four.  All right, we played that yesterday.  So what we got for today, Big A, at this point, she's watching him jerk off, telling him to  go faster, and she's laughing her ass off. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  He's not catching on.  Of course not.  He's hoping.  This is the second half of the Big A phone sex tape.  Would you like to see your tongue rolling off my naples?  Would that make you hot?  Oh, yeah.  It would just drive me crazy.  Strike it faster.  Rugged thumb back and forth over the top of it for me. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's what I need.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  Faster, baby.  Faster.  I'm so close.  I'm so close to coming.  Oh, God.  You say something sexy to me.  Oh, God.  She can't even hold it.  Yeah, I'll grab your hips. 
[02:13:30]  And my heart starts to keep in touchy and fuck you and fuck you so hard.  And you just turn all over my heart talk.  Oh, I wouldn't like that if I'm so close.  I'm just going to be close.  I'm going to come.  I need to come so bad.  Oh, do you want me to come for you?  Do you want to hear me come?  Do you want me to hear me come for you, baby? 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  You will be molested.  I wish it was a little clearer, the audio.  I know.  He's like he's over-modulating the mic.  He's all on top of it.  Yeah.  His big double chin flapping around.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism. 
[02:14:30]  Happens every time one of those dancers start poontanging around with those show folk fags.  Here's a word of advice.  If you're ever cammed up and jerking off for someone who you can't see,  and they're laughing like they're watching a Marx Brothers marathon,  they're not about to come.  Yeah, he didn't even acknowledge the fact that she busted out laughing.  He just kept on going.  Like the thought that it was not real and that he would have to, you know,  tuck it away in shame and disgrace could not cross his mind. 
[02:15:00]  He had to finish.  He thought she was five.  Here we go.  She gets him to admit he's called Big A on Opie and Anthony.  And what's your name?  What name would you like me to name?  Would you like me to name your real name?  Or the name that you use on Opie and Anthony?  What name would you like me to name?  Tell me. 
[02:15:30]  What name would you like me to name your real name?  What name would you like me to name your real name?  What name do they call you on Opie and Anthony?  If that's the thing that really turns me on, you know,  that you were on the show and I wanted to do somebody famous.  What name do they call you on the show?  Oh, God, I hope you guys are liking this. 
[02:16:00]  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Just in case no one can get it out by now.  The ch-ch-ch-ch-chig's up.  Where does he have the camera pointing?  Is it on his channel?  Oh, yeah.  I've heard.  I haven't seen it yet.  We're all going to watch together.  For the first time today.  I have heard it is square on his cock.  It's horrific. 
[02:16:30]  And, yeah, it couldn't be worse.  So does he blow his load and then 10 seconds later he goes,  Oh, yeah.  I gotta go.  Well, that's the grand finale.  But first, she has a screaming orgasm and laughs again.  Big A, I'm like that big.  It's like big with your cock.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Big A, I'm just kidding. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Big A, I love O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, God, Big A.  Mmm.  Oh. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  Can you come on the mark for me, please?  Oh, yeah.  I'm ready for you to come, Captain Slade.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Money for me. 
[02:18:00]  Money for me.  Oh, my God.  So Big A obviously asked her if she's ready for him to come.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are the new ones on here, Than?  No, not yet.  No, not yet.  Not yet.  We'll have them tomorrow, Anthony.  The ones from, um.  Yeah, we'll have them tomorrow.  Yeah, the good fellas ones.  That'll be tomorrow. 
[02:18:30]  It's okay.  It'll be okay.  No, I didn't know.  I was just asking.  I wasn't reprimanding.  You know, why aren't they on here?  I was just curious.  All right, here we go.  It's just curious.  The grand finale of Big A having phone sex with this girl in Australia.  Are you guys ready for this?  How long does this go on?  The whole thing?  We just got edited versions.  I know, but I heard it went on for about 40 minutes.  Yeah, 40 minutes or so.  40 minutes.  40 minutes.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  That was him. 
[02:19:30]  That was the money shot, huh?  That's the Big A money shot.  That's the Big A money shot.  I want to play it again for an obvious reason.  I want to play it again. 
[02:20:00]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Don't just look at it longingly. 
[02:20:30]  So, is there any kind of post-coital conversation from him?  Yeah, we had him on yesterday.  Yeah, we got to get him on again today.  He was really none too happy, but realized there wasn't much he could do about it.  Are we punching up the video?  We're trying.  Is that what we're trying?  We're attempting to get the actual video.  Is the computer refusing to show it?  Is the monitor actually going blank? 
[02:21:00]  Why is it on a...  No.  Danny's got a solution.  You want to...  How about we go to a break?  Danny's like MacGyver.  Yeah, I got to take a leak.  Yeah, we haven't leaked yet.  So, why don't we take a break?  Hopefully, when we get back, we'll watch the video for the first time.  Big A.  Jackin'.  Hey, this is Laszlo from the Technophile and Grand Theft Auto.

The undermanned and relocated Georgia Bulldogs win the SEC in surprise fashion over Arkansas on Sunday. 
[02:23:30]  It was a fantastic game.  Your number one seeds handed out.  Your brackets filled out.  Number one as follows.  The North Carolina Tar Heels, the number one overall, followed by Memphis, UCLA, and Kansas.  All those teams, winners of their conference championship.  As for your number two seeds in the NCAAs, Tennessee, Texas, Georgetown, and the Blue Devils of Duke.  Maybe a small snub, the Wisconsin Badgers.  They get in, they win the Big Ten tournament, but they're only a three seed.  And that's the XM Sports Nation College Basketball Minute.

[02:29:00]  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony program.  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Are the girls wowing on Pal Talk today, Anthony?  Yes, they are.  All righty. 
[02:29:30]  It's a wonderful thing.  Laszlo in studio.  The video is ready to go.  Waiting for Jimmy.  How long is this video, Hawk?  What, Hawk?  Five minutes long.  Oh.  Get my dick out.  That's an eternity.  Put it away.  Laszlo, go over there so you can see.  We're going to turn the screen around.  We'll try to make this work for the radio, but basically we're going to watch Big A jerk off. 
[02:30:00]  This is the first time we're seeing this video from his fine encounter with the Australian babe.  Let's go.  All right, where is it?  Turn around.  I can't even make out what that is.  It's the size of a postage stamp.  And I'm horrified.  Is he tugging on a flesh-colored new wow sticker?  Oh, no.  No.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, no. 
[02:30:30]  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Zoom in, Hawk.  Big A.  Big A.  Little C.  Little soldier.  Oh, my God.  That is a goddamn disgrace.  Looks like he shaved recently to make it look bigger.  Oh, my God.  That's all he's packing?  Oh, that is really sad.  Such a big, hulking guy.  And he's got that.  That is.  We're going to be arrested for kiddie porn. 
[02:31:00]  I think it's called, yeah.  Infantilism or something.  When you have the junk of an infant, it never grows.  Get him on the phone.  Someone call his.  Are you on, Andrew?  Big A.  Yo.  Yes.  Hi.  How are you today?  Oh.  Fucking great.  How are you guys doing? 
[02:31:30]  Don't worry.  It will be over soon, Big A.  Yeah.  Hang in there.  Don't go off all half-cocked.  We're kind of...  Oh, shit.  We're kind of reviewing your latest video.  Is that a special pinky ring you're wearing while you're jacking?  Or is it a cock wing?  Or is it a cock wing?  And, uh...  Well...  I don't know what to say.  I...  I'm... 
[02:32:00]  I don't know what to say.  I don't know what to say.  I don't know.  Hey, Big A.  Uh...  Yes?  Did you think that maybe someone might videotape you doing this?  No.  Do you use a different screen name or something?  No, I don't.  And you hooked up initially with this girl in an Opie and Anthony fan room? 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  Couldn't you possibly have thought for a second that you might be being set up?  Well, I thought about it, but...  Plus you hope it doesn't happen to you.  Well, you hope it doesn't happen to you.  Well, Andrew, here's what Andrew's doing.  He's whacking his bag.  He kind of cups it with the two fingers. 
[02:33:00]  The way you hold a teacup.  And then you jerk it, but then you stop and your penis just kind of flexes on its own.  Why do you stop and let it flex on its own?  He's letting it work out.  Oh, jeez.  He sounds like when Dateline comes in.  What were you doing talking to this 12-year-old?  Big A, what do you think of this girl for setting you up like this?  I'm a fucking cunt. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You do realize you can cover your entire penis with one of our new bumper stickers.  We got Blaze Angel on the phone, Big A.  She's, uh, yeah, she's on the phone here.  She's on the phone with you, Big A.  What do you want to say to her?  I think she's a little fucking cunt. 
[02:34:00]  And I was just using her voice.  If I actually saw her face and body, I would never have a camera.  Oh, yeah, never would have cammed up.  Wow.  Well, if she's a little cunt, you two make a perfect pair.  Blaze Angel, you want to defend yourself there? 
[02:34:30]  Blaze?  It's the worst.  You always want to look at your best.  You always want to look at your best.  And, uh, wow.  Hey, Blaze Angel.  Do you want to comment and defend yourself here?  Look at the finger moving.  His finger's moving.  Like, when he puts it by his thigh and his cock, like the finger moves like when he talks.  And he goes, moves his fingers.  Yeah.  Do you want to comment?  He's a bloody sex pest.  He gets in your PM after knowing you for two minutes and says, 
[02:35:00]  Hey, baby, do you have sex toys?  What to know about your favorite sexual positions and shit like that?  He got what he fucking deserved.  I was trying to be nice and put him off.  It's all about the, uh, sex, huh?  When, uh, when he's on?  Yeah, he didn't even want to know if I had a decent brain.  He just wanted to know about my body.  Nobody does.  You don't care if you've been lobotomized.  Well, fuck yes, you're laying there with an X mark on your head.  I want to hear about energies.  By the way, you have a very good phone sex voice.  You're really good. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, thank you.  That was, like, my first time.  That was really good.  I don't blame him for whacking his bag.  Good delivery.  She was fantastic.  What were you thinking while you were watching him stroke his mule?  I was pretty graced out, and I was really surprised.  I heard that American guys were packing a bit more of a package.  If you use this guy as a representative of all Americans, we will come down there and have  war with Australia.  That's right.  Don't make us pull out our cocks.  Yeah.  This is Asia.  Promises, promises. 
[02:36:00]  We have huge American cocks here.  Listen, get your screen cap ready.  I'm Jim Norton when I'm on there, and I'll definitely give my bag a good whack for you.  No way.  I'll try and work up a decent moment if I can.  Hey, Cindy, how did you find out about the Opie and Anthony show?  You listen online, obviously.  I met a fellow chatter called Pristine Sneakers.  He used to come into our friendly chat room and mix it up a bit.  Invited me into the Opie and Anthony Irish room, and they just started talking about you 
[02:36:30]  guys and playing bits of your parts and stuff like that.  Oh, God.  I can't.  Again, they're running the video again.  Big A.  It's on a loop.  Did he come?  We're going to call your dick Michael J. Fox.  It's little and twitches.  He stops, and then the dick just kind of moves on its own.  Yeah, and then it, like, twitches and jumps on its own.  It's like a puggle.  Like he's flexing his pelvic muscle.  Yeah, his penis has the stammer as well. 
[02:37:00]  And it's growing out of a triad of fat.  It's like your lap is a big triangle.  Hold on, Cindy, for a second, okay?  Okay.  What time is it in Australia?  It is 10 minutes to 12.  10 minutes to 12?  What day?  Nighttime.  Is it nighttime?  Is it almost Thursday?  So it's almost what day?  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Tell us what kind of weather we're going to have for Thursday.  It's almost Thursday?  Yeah.  Fuck the weather.  What's the lottery numbers for tonight?  Because it's only Wednesday here.  Yeah, how does that work?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  It's just a weird thing that happens.  It's frigging cold here at the moment.  Freeze the nuts off of brass muck.  Oh, it's cold here, too.  No, they're heading into winter in Australia.  Right.  They're below the equator.  Yes.  Hey, your toilet.  Clockwise or counterclockwise rotation?  Clockwise.  Clockwise. 
[02:38:00]  Actually, I think so.  I usually look down the toilet when it flushes.  Oh, you've got to look.  It's not high on the list.  You want to give the Opie and Anthony audience a little orgasm today?  You were good.  You were really good.  Thank you.  No, I can't do that live.  My pal mates are already...  Oh, man, you're such a slut already.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on for one second.  I'm trying to fluff up here.  Hold on for a second.  Let's say hi to BCH from Whackbag.  BCH. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'm just calling to put my vote in for gay.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, this...  Five guys sitting around watching another guy jerk off.  That's no homo.  That doesn't look good on paper.  No homo.  No homo.  No homo.  No homo.  Brian in Michigan, Brian.  Jim's saying nothing.  I was disappointed not to hear Big A say I'm...  Choking it.  Punch it out, fellas. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeffrey in Birmingham, Alabama.  Yeah, I was wondering if B.A. comes like he talks.  Dribbles half of it out before he shoots.  Holy crap.  Punch it out.  Let's go to Sally in Chicago.  She's a faithful listener of the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, Sally?  Hi.  I'm just thinking this could have been his big break.  He could have been another Tommy Lee if his hog had been big enough.  Unfortunately, Pam had a bigger coffin.  Instead of Tommy Lee, he's hung like Bruce Lee. 
[02:39:30]  Big A, you hanging in there?  There's another Pat Morita.  Big A, how you feeling?  I'm here.  I'm here.  How you feeling?  Hey, guys.  How does it feel to know that your cock would have looked great in the Yates tub?  Jesus.  Fucking great.  Oh, God.  All right.  I think we've seen enough of this video.  We have not.  We certainly have, Jimmy.  It's just been looping.  I could only watch it once myself. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Big A, this is going to be the last time you talk to this fine lady that set you up.  What do you have to say?  Big A, anything?  Big A?  Anything?  I have nothing to say.  I mean, she knows what she is and what she did. 
[02:40:30]  Nothing else to say.  Are your feelings hurt, Big A?  Um, I guess I'm going to need a tender sentiment.  He needs a tender sentiment.  All right.  Let me get, and Big A, a tender sentiment.  All right.  Oh, you guys are tender.  Yeah, a tender sentiment.  For Big A.  For Big A. 
[02:41:00]  It says, well, this is kind of ironic.  Like, it says, whatever you can conceive and believe, you can achieve.  Oh, yeah.  Except a hard-on bigger than an inch.  Well, it's just, it's odd that they say conceive.  Right.  It's going to be difficult to conceive with that little guy.  You're lucky if you can shoot past the lips.  All right, Big A. 
[02:41:30]  All right, Big A.  We've, uh, we've all seen it.  That's right.  Just walk away, Big A.  Just walk away.  By the way, does it hurt when, when birds swoop down and try to grab your cock and bring  it back to the nest?  Oh, you evil motherfuckers.  Seriously.  You started us.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I didn't think there was too many people out there who were sick and fucked up  as I.  There's only two countries listening to this.  What?  Sorry.  All right. 
[02:42:00]  Uh, Blaze Angel.  B-L-A-I-Z-E Angel on MySpace, right?  Hey, by the way, Blaze Angel, I heard you and Kara from MySpace got into it.  Somebody said there was, like, a yelling thing in the room.  Yeah, she got totally bent out of shape when I said to her, if you guys wanted a chat program  that was all kissy, smoochy, and cuddly, go back to fucking Yahoo.  Yahoo.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Blaze Angel.  Thank you.  We'll hear from you again, okay? 
[02:42:30]  No worries.  All right.  There she goes.  Big A.  Bye.  Big A.  Yes.  You all right?  You're not going to do anything stupid, right?  You're not going to try to smother us with a pillow or anything.  No, I mean do that again.  It's really stupid.  You're not going to take Obie's Cheerios and fuck them all without breaking them, are you?  No, no, not at all.  Let's say hi to Chad.  When you were with a girl, did she ever try to thread your dick?  Oh, my God.  Big A, I was trying to help you, but now the phones have caught up to us, so now we've got 
[02:43:00]  to take a few calls.  They weren't really ringing, and now they're ringing off the hook, and you could have got  out of this.  Chad the Trucker.  Chad?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I think you guys should change up Big A's name to Little A.  Well, by the way, Chad, what are you hauling?  I'm hauling, uh, stairs.  Wow.  Stairs?  You know those pull-down attic stairs? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Who needs that?  Got a whole load of pull-down attic stairs.  Wow.  The trucks are just, you don't know what they're hauling on.  You were hoping for the nuclear waste, weren't you?  Something exciting?  Something exciting, and then you get one pull-down stairs.  Be a suicide jockey or something, and what are you hauling?  Pull-down attic stairs.  That's a hell of a...  Nothing exciting going on here.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, those springs can snap and hurt somebody.  They certainly can, and what else would you use a slinky on if it weren't for them? 
[02:44:00]  Let's go to Kay in Louisiana.  Kay, what's up?  Hey, you shouldn't make fun of Big A.  Don't you know it's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean?  Yeah, but...  Yeah.  Miss, when you're in the ocean with a life raft, it's...  All of a sudden, size becomes a little more important.  It certainly does.  The Titanic is sinking, and he's got two fucking fat women sitting on his, floating in the...  Well, I always kind of ran out there, right?  I realized I was doing this.  I was waiting for the, like, fat girl on the door joke or something. 
[02:44:30]  I just didn't need a fat girl in there.  I just threw it in because I was running out of steam on it.  All right, let's go to Scotty in Pennsylvania.  Scotty.  That happens.  Morning, guys.  Hey, if Big A and Patty would have had sex on their date, would Patty still have remained a virgin?  Good question.  That's right.  Good question.  Leave old acorn dick alone.  Let's say hi to John in Utah.  John?  Yeah, is this going to be the first on-air suicide?  Yeah, you're not going to, you know, feel so bad that you do anything to yourself there, Big A, right? 
[02:45:00]  No, not at all.  No.  I won't drive my car off a cliff or nothing like that.  No, you still love yourself, right?  I guess.  Don't put your dick in an electrical socket.  Were you fully erect in that video?  So, I mean, at least defend yourself.  Laszlo wants to know.  Laszlo's popping a little shit.  Yeah.  Well, we got tender sentiments coming in for some tender sentiments. 
[02:45:30]  Let's go to Dave in Tennessee.  Wait, wait.  Hold on, Dave.  Hold on.  All right, Dave.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I had a tender sentiment for Big A.  All right.  It's the little things you do that mean the most.  Well, that's tender and a sentiment.  Wow.  That is rough.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Apparently not. 
[02:46:00]  All right, Big A.  We should let you go.  Yeah.  Maybe you could put a green wig on your dick and let it work in Willy Wonka's factory.  Let's go to Bill in New York.  See, there was another chance we could let him go.  Bill.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Bill.  Hey, yeah, you know, it's not the size of the ship.  It's a motion in the ocean.  But I'll tell you what, it'd take a long time to get to England in a fucking rowboat.  Oh, my God.  Mike from Pennsylvania. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, yo, is Big A the thumb-wrestle champion of the OPNP show?  Thumb-wrestling.  It kind of looked like he was thumb-wrestling with himself, yes.  All right.  All right.  I'm out, thanks.  All right.  That was really, let's see, we got a guy named Steve.  Huh.  Steve from...  Where's he from?  Uh, well, hold on a minute. 
[02:47:00]  I'm trying to improvise, and I'm doing a horrific job.  Hold on, because I've got to get a sound effect ready.  Uh, let's see.  We're going to go to the phones, but first, uh...  Um...  We interrupt this program to bring you...  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Wow, who saw this coming?  Jim, yes, you got a midget sighting?  Uh, yeah.  I'm, uh, looking at Big A's cock.  Meanwhile, back at the show... 
[02:47:30]  Ow.  Loompa Loompa.  I thought you were doing Steve from Yellowstone.  No, I got all messed up.  He goes, yeah, we're going to Steve.  Hey, Jim.  No, I finally said that.  Yeah, no, it wasn't a Steve, Paul.  Yeah, I came out of it a little bit.  Barely?  I don't know.  I don't know what Steve would have to say to him.  All right, Big A.  Here's, uh, someone...  Here's someone talking to Big A on Earth 2.  This is a giant cock. 
[02:48:00]  Ramone, bring me a cock that smells like Similek.  I got...  Well, I might have a little audio of Big A, actually, Anthony.  Having an orgasm.  All right.  All right.  Where is Thumpkin?  Where is Thumpkin? 
[02:48:30]  In your pants.  In your pants.  Hey, uh, Tony from...  The itsy bitsy penis.  Tony from Long Island.  Dribbled like a broken spout.  How you doing?  Why, knowing you have that, would you ever take it out?  All right.  We got Tony from Long Island.  What's up, guys?  Why don't you guys cut him a little flat?  We were on Pal Talk, and he pulled out a tiny penis. 
[02:49:00]  He said it was a penis.  I wanted to put Claricell on it.  They wouldn't have found it.  They were going to find it, Henry.  They were looking at his underwear. 
[02:49:30]  Uh, Pat from Wunaki.  Hey.  Hey, Pat.  Uh, first I'd like to say, uh, I don't like that lady for, uh, decepting, uh, Big A.  Yeah.  And I wanted to know, uh, does this penis look like a, uh, fetus clutching a cherry?  Uh, uh, this.  Wow.  I have an idea how we could help these two out, though. 
[02:50:00]  Maybe we could cut Big A's cock off, and Pat could use it as his tenth toe.  You're being cruel and incentive, this torch maker.  Here's the first girl Big A was with.  We're cakes for nothing! 
[02:50:30]  Big A, you still there?  Yes, gentlemen, I am.  We have audio of Blaze Angel when she saw Big A's penis for the first time.  Yeah.  Just walk away.  Oh, mother.  What?  I thought she was going to take some hormone therapy there.  Hey, that one worked, though, but...  Just walk away.  That's not the one I wanted.  I don't know what happened there.  I've never heard of that one before in my life. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Big A, you got any final thoughts, things you might want to say to wrap the whole thing up?  Yeah.  He was banging cocktail straws two at a time.  Look how God massacred my boy. 
[02:51:30]  We'll get rid of this.  All right.  All right, Big A, I think we're done.  Yeah, Big A, wow, that was pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend doing it again.  Yeah, I think you've learned an important lesson about whipping your cock out in front of everybody.  At least find girls in other rooms that have nothing to do with O&A and get a new screen name.  And don't talk. 
[02:52:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, Big A.  I hope we don't find out that you killed yourself.  I'd hate to hear that they found you hung.  Here's the sound that was going on during his conception.  All right.  Well, Big A, thank you for, I don't know. 
[02:52:30]  I have no idea what to say anymore.  Being a good sport.  Making us all feel better about ourselves.  That's true.  Hey, this is Quentin Tarantino, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Mondays are reserved for Artist Confidential on Channel 2, XMX.  It's back-to-back Artist Confidentials today from two bands that completely rock.  They rocked decades ago, and they're still amazing today and coming up with new material. 
[02:53:00]  First, it's Ann Wilson and Hart, and then Duran Duran.  They're both back-to-back all day long right now on Channel 2.  XM's exclusive music.  Channel 2.  XMX.  Tell your boss the great news.  You can all start working from home tomorrow.  Hi, I'm Dave Graveline for Into Tomorrow.  WebShare just became one step easier with a service called YouGoo that allows you to work remotely from home, 
[02:53:30]  or wherever you want, for that matter, and still interact with your colleagues as though you're sitting right next to them.  No need to schlep into the office that frosty morning, for example.  Just gather your documents and applications and have instant online meetings with any number of people to discuss business.  Collaboration has never been easier.  YouGoo, spelled Y-U-U-G-U-U, works cross-platforms from Mac to Mac and Mac to PC.  Here's your chance to bring your boss and colleagues Into Tomorrow with YouGoo and the future of web sharing. 
[02:54:00]  I'm Dave Graveline, inviting you to stop by, visit our website whenever you have time at Graveline.com.  And join us Into Tomorrow.  More than a quarter century in the making.  That's been a real blessing.  35 albums.  My life's been grand.  Almost 60 number one hits.  Over 400 songs.  All my exes live in Texas. 
[02:54:30]  The music.  The life.  The career.  It's been a long time since I've mowed the grass.  Three jukeboxes full of boot-scrapin' honky-tonk hits.  Straight country.  Debuts April 1st on XM17.  From Consumer Reports, optimizing your HDTV.  I'm Ernie Sprantz.  When you first plug in your new HDTV, everything won't magically turn into high-definition.  You have to make sure you have everything required to watch HD. 
[02:55:00]  A surprising number of HDTV owners, about half by some estimates, are not getting HD programming because they're missing something.  To get high-def content from a cable, satellite, or phone company, you need high-def service.  Digital programming can be standard or high-definition.  You must specify that you want high-def.  Your receiver or set-top box must also be high-def capable.  Next, you'll need component video or HDMI cables to connect the receiver to the TV. 
[02:55:30]  Other cables, such as S-Video, can't carry high-def.  Finally, you must be tuned to an HD channel.  The high-def version of a channel has a different number from its usual standard-definition counterpart,  and usually has the letters HD in the on-screen program guide listing it.  When you turn on your new TV, don't panic if it doesn't look as stunning as it did in the showroom.  The default factory settings on most TVs are designed to create a super-bright, vividly-colored image to lure shoppers,  but they're almost always a bad choice for use at home. 
[02:56:00]  Tweaking the settings can greatly improve picture quality.  Adjusting picture settings individually can yield better results, but it's easier to use presets, so try them out first.  I'm Ernie Sprantz for Consumer Reports, online at ConsumerReports.org.  The Opie and Anthony Animation Festival is coming soon, and there's big prize money for the winner,  so get those animations in now.  Send your broadcast-quality animations mailed into the Opie and Anthony Show Animation Festival,  111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019. 
[02:56:30]  The boys will have all the details on the big shit and dig once they get back from break.  So if you're in need of several thousand dollars in prize money, get your animating ass busy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Animation Festival, coming sometime in May or June.  The Opie and Anthony Show, previously on Lost.  Ben from Lost, of course, and great to have you here.  Huge fan of the show, like Ops said, as is everybody.  It is one of the most talked-about shows. 
[02:57:00]  There aren't many shows like that.  You've got to be really proud to be on a successful show.  Did you see the potential for this?  Did you know you were going to be on the show?  Any part of that Ben character in you?  It's very difficult.  Bastards.  Interesting character.  Opie and Anthony.  The early season predictions don't matter.  The trades that were made or not made, they don't matter. 
[02:57:30]  The schedule, the overtime losses, the shot that rang the goalpost and bounced out and not in,  none of that matters.  Nobody cares.  It's all about here and now.  And right here, right now, there are only three words that you need to worry about.  Three words that matter.  Just win, baby.  The push to the playoffs.  NHL Home Ice.  XM 204.  B-A-C-H-C-I-O-N.  The Opie and Anthony Show is taking a short break in the middle of March. 
[02:58:00]  Because let's face it, when you work in a confined environment with a bunch of volatile personalities,  all of whom think that their opinion is the most valid,  you can pretty much last a few months before you want to go on a fucking shooting rampage.  Die!  Die!  Die!  So we're taking a little time for ourselves to decompress and regroup.  Until then, enjoy the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Or go outside.  You're all pretty much shut-ins anyway.

They beat Arkansas and go wire to wire to win the SEC tournament.  The undermanned and relocated Georgia Bulldogs win the SEC in surprise fashion over Arkansas on Sunday.  It was a fantastic game.  Your number one seeds handed out.  Your brackets filled out.  Number one as follows.  The North Carolina Tar Heels, the number one overall, followed by Memphis, UCLA, and Kansas. 
[03:00:30]  All those teams, winners of their conference championship.  As for your number two seeds in the NCAAs, Tennessee, Texas, Georgetown, and the Blue Devils of Duke.  Maybe a small snub, the Wisconsin Badgers.  They get in, they win the Big Ten tournament, but they're only a three seed.  And that's the XM Sports Nation College Basketball Minute.

[03:01:30]  The Dullman Show.  Murphy, Murphy, Murphy, darling and dear, I long for you now, night and day.  Your pain was my pleasure, your sorrow, my joy, I fear now I've lost it to health and good cheer. 
[03:02:00]  Doctor, when I met you, I was five years too young.  A boy beyond his ages, so I tell someone.  Anyone who'd listen and a few who couldn't care. 
[03:02:30]  Still, I welcomed you with open arms, my love I did share.  You shut me off, then you showed me the door.  But you always came calling back, begging me for more.  I showed you kindness, a stool and a tab.  Then you poured me my pain in a dirty glass. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, you left him bloody battered, neons and more.  You know why I first start to wonder how he made it through my door.  With my brother's new non-duplicate registry I did.  Well, you bit up more than you could chew the first day you met me.  Darcy, Darcy, darling dear, you left me dying by a bear.  I'm whiskey, dear, you want some beer, I'm helping you myself.  You weren't the first to court me, mister, you won't be the last. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, I'm sure I wasn't, honey, I know all about your past.  Listen to the big shot with his pager on call.  You spent most of those nights in my bathroom stall.  Yeah, you got him high, but you left him alone.  Mind your own business, boy, how was I to know  that he was just a fiend and a no-good cheat?  Well, it's all in the past, bitch, cause now I got it, bitch.  Darcy, Darcy, darling dear, you left me dying by a bear. 
[03:04:00]  I'm whiskey, dear, you want some beer, I'm helping you, my darling dear.  Darcy, Darcy, darling dear, you left me dying by a bear.  I'm whiskey, dear, you want some beer, I'm helping you, my darling dear. 
[03:04:30]  Darcy, Darcy, darling dear, you left me dying by a bear.  I'm whiskey, dear, you want some beer, I'm helping you, my darling dear.  Darcy, Darcy, Darcy, darling dear, you want some beer, I'm helping you, my darling dear.  My dear, my dear, Darcy, Darcy, my darling dear. 
[03:05:00]  Darcy, Darcy, Darcy, Darcy, Darcy, Darcy.  It's the worst.  I just want everyone to take notice of the guy that has passed out.  Yeah, we have our first passed out guy.  As soon as I said that, he popped his head off the table for the first time in about a half hour, 40 minutes.  That's the Rumpelman's guy.  Rumpelman's. 
[03:05:30]  No, but it was a 20-second rule.  He was down for 20 seconds.  That officially counts.  He was fucking passed out.  Oh, he was passed out.  Of course he was.  Right, definitely.  And he's going back to sleep, so.  All right, we got a my five for the first eight people to rape him while he's passed out.  I'm absolutely wasted.  Yeah, he's wasted.  Is that what he said?  I'm absolutely wasted.  Kenny's over there for an exclusive interview with the first passed out guy.  The shit just offended everybody.  Kenny, talk to him again.  We couldn't hear you.  We were talking over here.  I'm not an animal. 
[03:06:00]  I'm absolutely wasted.  You're wasted.  What time did you start drinking, sir?  5.20.  5.20.  And you were drinking Rumpelman's?  How much Rumpelman's have you drank?  The whole bottle.  That is a fucked up individual, man.  Wow.  Dude, don't you realize it's St. Paddy's Day, but it's only a quarter after nine and you're shot?  Monster Rain.  Big Yellow One's son. 
[03:06:30]  The guy blew his load before nine o'clock.  He started on the 16th.  You've got to love that.  Give me a my five.  He's an alcoholic.  Oh, completely.  He does this every day.  Yeah, this isn't a celebration one day.  He wants a my five for being drunk.  No.  A my five for being drunk.  Maybe if he pisses his pants or something.  Yeah.  Only if he gets behind the wheel and gets on the LIE.  You'll piss your pants.  Wait, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, talk to him. 
[03:07:00]  See if he'll do that.  Will you piss your pants, sir?  Absolutely.  All right, get him on stage.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Get him on stage.  Oh, my God.  Get him on stage.  Hey, you guys, thanks for having me down here.  I appreciate it.  I'll see you guys later.  This is great.  Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.  Yeah, Billy, you're going to have to follow this, by the way.  Yeah, Billy.  I know how you...  I know.  I just got back from Shreveport.  He's talking about coming from fucking Iraq.  They were fucking shooting missiles at me.  It was fucking unreal.  Right in the middle.  All right, hold on.  Not on the chair, man.  I got to fucking sit down. 
[03:07:30]  We got to just stand there.  Hold on.  We got to set this up nice.  We have a spotlight or something we could use today?  Nope.  No pulling down here, man.  I was told this was a family show.  I'm here to hype a benefit.  All right.  Anyone have any...  I don't know.  We need some kind of spotlight that we could shine on this guy.  Hard Rock Johnny.  We got a spotlight.  Yeah, and some live electrical wire.  All right.  Hard Rock Johnny is getting the spotlight.  Yeah, we'll give you a bumper sticker if you push some...  Make sure he doesn't topple off the stage, Kenny.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  He's kind of toppled.  I got him.  I got him.  Make sure he doesn't fall. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, if we're going to do this, we got to do this right.  So sit down for a minute, sir, so you don't fall on your head again.  Billy's had it.  Wait, Billy's had it already?  No, he's not going.  He's right here.  It's my chair.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you're not going to piss in the chair.  We'll get a new chair.  Yeah, we'll get you a new chair.  All right, we're working on the spotlight.  We got Billy Burr in the house.  We got other people that have come up with things to do for the MIFIs.  One guy wants to drink urine.  Oh, wow.  Hey, man, I read it in a book once that it's safe.  Jimmy already has a MIFI. 
[03:08:30]  All right, wait, that's the light we're going to use?  No, Hard Rock Johnny, I guess he's working it out.  Great, we got a pen light.  All right, Hard Rock Johnny is going to work on the lights.  You got it?  I can't hear you, sir.  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Why did you guys need me to come here, by the way?  You're hanging out.  Yeah, come on over here, Billy.  Sweetie, here's your water.  There you go.  Thank you, Toots.  We like having more people around when we do stupid stuff like this because then we have  more people to blame.  Exactly.  What about the guy drinking the urine for the MIFI? 
[03:09:00]  No.  Hey, this guy here wants to comment on the urine.  How about this?  If this guy pees his pants, if the guy wants to put this guy's underwear over his face,  I think that's going to be a good one.  That's a good one.  God, we are a classy show, aren't we?  Sir, now, you're pretty drunk, right, Kenny the mic?  You're pretty drunk, right?  Yes, I am.  Now, when was the last time you took a leak?  How old are you going?  About a half hour ago. 
[03:09:30]  A half hour ago?  Now, you've drank a lot of alcohol.  I hope he was there.  Oh.  Wait, where was he?  Oh.  So the last time he took a leak was a half hour ago and I hope he was there.  And he had a small hog.  I hope he was just jogging around the bathroom.  He didn't mean to.  Yeah.  I came across you and you're a hog.  So, now, do you feel like you can go again?  Oh, yeah.  Now, would you have any problem with being in front of the crowd like this and wetting your pants for a MyFive? 
[03:10:00]  I'll try my best.  Do you think you could do it, though?  I think I might.  Yeah, all right.  Well, he is completely ready to do this, I guess.  No stage fright, man.  Just let it go.  What about stage fright?  I know if you're down there in the bathroom, sometimes it's kind of hard to get a little stage fright.  Hold on.  Ben is panicking.  It is hard and it's hard when I don't have a, you know, a seven-year-old boy to help me out.  Uh-oh.  He's trying his hand at humor.  All right.  Well, that are true confessions. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Why don't we turn him around here?  Why don't we be back with pedophile urination?  We're not going to have a spotlight, so we'll use that little pen light, I guess, that Hawk is holding.  Eric, stand him up.  That's, Billy, your chair is now free.  Billy Burberry.  No, that's his.  Yeah, that's his now.  All right.  All right.  Just stand there.  In the spirit of St. Patrick's Day.  Hey, Kenny, what's his name, by the way?  Chris.  Chris?  Chris, it might be easier if you shut your eyes and just relax.  Yeah.  And think about things like water. 
[03:11:00]  Does anyone have a pair of shorts I can wear home?  Don't worry.  It's not going to matter.  You're going to be passed out the rest of the day anyway, so.  Jesus Christ.  No, you're not showing anything.  Yeah, you're not taking it out.  Yeah, you're not taking it out.  I got to piss my pants down.  No, no, there's no taking anything out.  I have, like, a pair of sweatpants I can wear home.  There's no taking anything out, friend.  I like these people taking pictures at this moment.  Of course.  I guess it's going to go into this crap club.  Get your hand out of it.  Don't take it out.  Don't take it out.  All right, here we go.  Everyone, hands to your side. 
[03:11:30]  Wait, everyone, let's quiet the crowd so he can concentrate.  All right.  Hands to your side.  We don't want him to have performance anxiety here.  It's as easy as that.  Keep your hands out of your pants.  Yeah, get your hands out of your pants.  Get your hands out of your pants, sir.  He has to massage the area to induce urination.  Oh, Christ.  What's wrong with you?  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  No, don't.  No.  Don't touch.  We don't want to see it.  You can't take it out, dude. 
[03:12:00]  As hot as that would be.  Come on, just let it go.  All right, I'm trying, trying, trying.  I just want to see the front of his pants turn darker.  He needs a fluffer to take a piss.  A fluffer.  No turning on.  Come on, take your hand out.  It's your pants.  It's your pants.  It's your pants.  It's your pants.  That'll help.  It's your pants.  It's your pants.  I know, right?  Hold on, hold on.  Keep chanting.  Come on, everybody.  Don't look at him.  Come on.  Don't look at him. 
[03:12:30]  It's your pants.  It's your pants.  Oh, no.  The crowd is chanting.  Oh, no.  He's pissed himself.  He's pissed his pants.  He's pissed his pants.  Oh, my God.  In front of hundreds of guys.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  I think we're in trouble.  Gee, you think?  All right.  Enough.  Enough.  All right.  Enough.  Cut it off. 
[03:13:00]  Cut it off.  Enough.  Enough.  Get him out of here.  Oh, my God.  It stinks up here.  All right.  Let's hear it for Chris.  The first winner of a MyFive.  Oh, God.  Get him out of here.  Wow.  Wait.  Get him into a bathroom.  Hey, what do you think of that, guys?  That's something you don't see every day.  I think he shit his pants also.  He stinks.  Winner.  Winner.  Well, give that guy a MyFive.  That guy wins a MyFive.  What a great moment for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:13:30]  Another proud broadcasting moment.  Hey, they're giving us the cheers for that one, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I like the photographs, like someone just hit a home run to win the World Series.  Just sitting there.  Ba-bam, ba-bam.  I've got to capture this moment.  Is everything okay up on the stage?  Yeah.  No bleach.  That's good.  All right.  We just used a â€“ he just absorbed it in his pants, I guess.  So I wasn't able to see, thank God, but the crowd, did it slowly just get â€“ his 
[03:14:00]  pants got darker in the front and down his leg a little bit?  Was that what I was hearing?  You're getting a lot of nods, Anthony.  Regular jeans, the choice for serious alcoholics.  Yeah, you know, that's a great tie-in for St. Paddy's Day because, you know, a lot of  people piss, shit, and puke themselves on St. Paddy's Day.  So that was kind of nice.  The guy got intoxicated and wet himself, and he goes home a winner.  Right.  Yeah.  You don't have time to go to the bathroom when you drink it.  Right.  Just let it happen.  Is that the same chair?  No.  He was okay in it, though. 
[03:14:30]  He didn't do that.  Fantastic.  See, that's the type of stuff we're looking for.  I got to tell you that Ben was panicking the whole time.  I wouldn't look at him because I knew if I looked at him, I would have started going,  oh, maybe we shouldn't do this.  I got to tell you, at times, we're becoming a bunch of pussies with this new show.  Yeah.  And Ben's, like, holding a huge sign, take a break, take a break, take a break.  Freaking out.  No.  When a man can't â€“  Ben has no comment.  When we've reached a point in our lives where a man can't get up in front of a crowd of 
[03:15:00]  people and piss himself, I don't want to be part of this country, Ben.  That's right, Anthony.  That's right.  You know, a man should have the freedom, if he wants to, to win a MiFi, to come up in  front of a group of people like yourselves on this festive occasion, like St. Paddy's  Day, intoxicated, just drunk to the bejesus.  And if he wants to, if he feels he wants to, to have the freedom.  Thank you, Opie.  The freedom. 
[03:15:30]  This country is about freedom.  And to be able to walk up in front of you people.  If a man wants to piss himself, I say yes.  Ask not where a bathroom is, just piss your pants.  That's what I say.  I want his pants as wet as Mary Jo Kopechny's head hours after I went into the river. 
[03:16:00]  Absolutely.  Why should I have to find a bathroom when I could just piss myself in a drunken stupid  here?  I say that's what America is about.  And I'm not going to have some herky-jerky, big-hog communist telling me where a man could  piss himself.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Ick, bin, ein, piss myself. 
[03:16:30]  Mr. Gorbachev, I don't want to take down these pants.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you so much.  We will try to broadcast for four more years, but I wouldn't count on it.  Wow, that was really, really good. 
[03:17:00]  Let me tell you something.  Whenever you hear change, big change in Washington, we need change.  It's socialism.  I've had it.  I've had it with Democrats and liberals and people with this dream, this goddamn false dream  that everyone's going to share.  Go to Russia!  Goddamn communists!  They're all communists!  The commies are back from the 80s.  It's the new, improved 21st century communists. 
[03:17:30]  This country's never a place where somebody comes and goes,  take care of me!  When the frick did that happen?  It's a place that you work your ass off and you might make it.  Some people will make it, some people won't.  Jesus Christ!  It's not friggin' Russia!  Goddamn communists!  O.B. and Anthony!  O.B. and Anthony!

[03:20:30]  Welcome to the Esquire Minute.  I'm Andy Langer.  Month in and out, we recommend what we call the big important book of the month.  This time it's from Richard Price.  And Richard Price knows things.  He knows how crime sounds and smells, and he knows that it's all tied up in race and class.  Two big subjects, all too rare in American fiction.  In Clockers, he made agonizing drama out of an insight that still eludes most of America's political class.  Lush Life, Price's new one, is his version of a comedy.  Three wannabe artists are out on a bender in New York's trendy Lower East Side 
[03:21:00]  when a couple of kids from the projects try to rob him.  Wannabe A gets shot, but wannabe B is too drunk to remember.  And wannabe C is so bitter about his failure as an artist, the cops assume he did the shooting.  The novel plays out from there, stocked with trendy posers and confused thugs.  Price has been around what seems like forever, but there's a reason we still read him.  Because every sentence is a pleasure.  He takes just enough time to make you care.  For more, check out this month's issue of Esquire on newsstands now,  or visit us on the web at Esquire.com.

[03:22:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:22:30]  We drink and we sing and we drink and we die.  We have no heads.  No, we have no heads.  They come over here and they chop off our legs.  They cut off our hands and put nails in our eyes.  Oh, great, he is dead and oh, Hanrahan's gone.  We drink and we die and continue to drink. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, Hanrahan.  No, Hanrahan.  Oh, Hanrahan.  Oh, Hanrahan.  They buried all near down in Counting Shehane, the poor children crying in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay, in Hay. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, Abraham. Oh, Abraham. We drink and we sing and we drink and we sing. We drink and we drive and we puke and we drink. We drink and we fight and we bleed and we cry. We puke and we smoke and we drink and we die. It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. I like my penis. 
[03:24:00]  I want to continue with something we started today. Now, you're very knowledgeable. You know a lot of this stuff.  Oh, I try. And I want to know what horrific memory from your childhood has been pushed out of your brain so that is in its place.  It could have been the big, fat American Indian woman trying to rape me in a barn when I was about 13 years old at Jimmy Jackson's ranch. 
[03:24:30]  What? All right, listen.  We started a new thing today for the listeners, the hardcore listeners. We all know that Anthony's very knowledgeable, but it's finally became quite apparent that he's filling his brain with all this useless nonsense to forget about horrific things that happened to you as a child.  Now, you've never told this story on the air before.  No, I think I did tell it. It was at Jimmy Jackson's, who was a crazy cowboy out there when I was living in California.  He used to sell dead horses.  Yeah, he tried to sell people dead horses and stuff. He ran a rent string and I used to run it for him. 
[03:25:00]  Very equestrian part of California. I lived in San Juan Capistrano.  A lot of horses. It's where the swallows come back. Blah, blah, blah.  But there was a party going on there. Everybody's drunk, of course.  And I went around the back to the barn to take a leak and there was this big, fat American Indian woman.  And she was kind of in the barn.  And she got a peek at your monster 12-year-old car. 
[03:25:30]  And she wanted...  She thought it was a kayak.  Shut up.  She wanted to, as she said, roll around in the hay with me.  And I zipped up pretty quickly and started getting out of there.  And she was all drunk and she started rolling and kind of crawling toward me.  And I think if she got like a hold of my leg, it would have been over.  And the things that scared me the most... 
[03:26:00]  You're going to TP on your face?  Like, I was hammered at the time, too.  Who knows? I probably would have fucked her, but...  Rapes and hay.  Yeah.  Is that her American Indian name?  Rapes and hay.  Hey, squall.  But the thing that scared me is her husband was there at the party.  And he looked like fucking Billy Bear from 48 Hours.  Just a big engine with a knife.  And that kind of scared me that, you know, he was going to chop me to pieces and stuff.  So I got out of there.  But that was one of those horrific memories that probably shouldn't happen to a young boy. 
[03:26:30]  How old are you?  14?  I think 13.  She was a big, fat Indian with little hands.  Like those little Indian hands.  Yeah, little Indian hands.  She had like the, I don't know...  Did you see her naked?  ...whole Aztec face.  The zitty Indian face?  I don't know what it was.  It was like kind of an Aztec flat thing.  And, uh, uh, no, she wasn't naked, but she, um, she was like kind of toying with herself.  Yuck.  Yeah.  I think she was waiting for anyone to come back there to take a piss. 
[03:27:00]  Like anybody.  She had nice little hands for making trinkets.  Great little hands for making beaded $1.50 trinkets.  Buffing turquoise.  Yes.  Trying to trade a blowjob for some beads.  Yeah.  More importantly, when did you realize you had a monster cock?  At what age?  Hey!  I just think I'm average.  When did you realize it was monstrous?  12?  13?  Um, I, you know, you just don't know. 
[03:27:30]  You don't think.  How many oh my gods have you got?  Don't compare to what I think.  My God.  Let's talk about your cock for a few minutes.  You got a big cock.  This is quite embarrassing.  Yeah, I think he does.  He does.  I don't talk about my, my...  The famous wow story from our Boston days proves that Anthony is packing something monstrous.  That was something that just, uh, it must have been perfect timing.  That's right.  I bet it was out there.  They saw it.  Anthony has a huge, just helmet.  Just defined.  Why is the discussion turned to my dick? 
[03:28:00]  To your monstrous dick?  It's got to be really defined from his shaft.  Yeah.  And then it just goes, spreads out like a big wild mushroom.  Shut the fuck up.  You think he has a big, thick crown on his?  Oh, a big, huge crown.  He has a Portobello dick.  Huge, huge Portobello.  He's got a play, he's got a Playboy cartoon cock.  Just a huge, just a well-defined.  Stop it.  His pee hole is huge.  Right.  Look, I won't be party to this.  You could stick like a half a, half a dollar in his pee hole.  I don't like the idea of Bob Kelly fantasizing about my dick. 
[03:28:30]  No, you're monstrous.  Stop.  We're inserting change into it.  Yes, I know.  What the fuck is it?  I bet it hooks to the left.  It has a hook to it.  Would you please?  It's not that we're gay.  We're just curious in a Ripley's Believe It or Not way.  We're not gay, we're amazed.  Yeah, we...  How many times has that been used?  I'm not gay.  I'm just amazed.  Just amazed.  Just amazed.  We want to see the midget, the bearded lady, and your monstrous dick. 
[03:29:00]  All for a dollar.  With your big vein down the top of it.  Just a huge...  Well-defined veins.  Yeah, just a...  More than one.  Oh, just a huge motherfuckers.  You guys just see his pulse going.  It's not a pulsating vein.  What do you think his ball bag looks like?  Oh, he's got a big, droopy, old man sack.  I do not!  It actually makes his dick bigger, because it stretches out the skin.  Yeah.  It is.  A deflated weather balloon.  Everything's very nice and tight.  Where he's a...  Deflated weather balloon. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, like an Area 51 balloon.  It's the thing that fucking crashed in Roswell, but it's fleshy.  It has big fucking oblong balls in it.  You think he's ashamed to wear shorts, because of the monstrous nature of his cock?  I wear shorts!  He has to wear a jockstrap, because his fucking huge sack would just sink out of his shorts.  Why are these fantasies of Bob Kelly coming out that are completely inaccurate about my genitalia?  But it's in a P.T. Barnum way.  Let's just keep it, you know... 
[03:30:00]  See the man whose cock could gag a hippo.  I'm gonna come down your throat.  You fucking will better swallow it all.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  You can stick five quarters in his pee hole.  Yeah, Jimmy...  We call him...  Jimmy Jakes...  Jimmy Jakes is writing, Ant's cock has an elbow in it.  Is that true, Anthony?  No!  It's got a joint.  Yeah.  And for the people that are lingering longer, yes, of course. 
[03:30:30]  Show us your quack!  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  He doesn't trim.  You don't trim anything down there.  Doesn't have a femur.  I'm not explaining my trimming habits to anybody.  You don't trim anything.  I don't think Anthony believes in that grooming thing.  How do you know?  He trims a little bit sloppy.  I think he's got a landing strip.  I'm just a landing strip.  Which I recently did to myself, and it's worked out well.  Anthony, can we get your cell phone and rub it on your box right now? 
[03:31:00]  Not my box!  Do I have a box?  I shave everything.  Anybody else?  No, I trim it way down.  You don't want to look like a fucking baby.  Jeff from...  I don't.  As a man, you can't do that.  Women doing that is fine, but a guy shaving everything is a little weird there, Jimmy.  Jeff from Sacramento writes, was Anthony the model for the Superbad drawings?  Stop.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Cloverfield 2.  The attack of the Kumia cops.  Yes.  You should have said that to JJ. 
[03:31:30]  You should have brought that up.  Yes, I could have starred in the...  No.  No?  It's, it's, it's, uh, you're, you're, you're being inaccurate.  When Anthony fucking walks naked around the house with a heart on, it's like, you know  that when a horse does it, it bounces up and down?  Yeah.  Because there's too much weight and it's too long.  Yeah.  It just has like a bounce.  Top heavy.  It's a top heavy cock.  Top heavy cock.  Have you ever had a weighty, a weighty penis that hits the water as you're sitting down  to take a dump?  No.  My, my...  Every once in a while, mine will get weighty and it'll, it'll hit water. 
[03:32:00]  My balls are so big.  The toilet's clogged and it'll get flushed.  What do you mean it gets weighty?  Like it's bloating?  I call it weighty.  It's just like, it's, it's, it's heavy.  And all of a sudden it's just got a dip.  I piss on my balls.  It goes in for a dip.  I piss on my nuts.  My, I have a few really big balls and sometimes on my...  Or a really hobbly tiny cock.  Both.  I think it's a mixture of both.  You can't clear your bag.  I can't.  This cock looks like a spy versus spy bomb.  That was great. 
[03:32:30]  Is it small, Bob?  Oh, no.  It's, I have a, I have a, a grow another shower.  Oh, well that's what everyone says that has a small one.  You know what I mean?  That's what you tell the girls.  Just wait now.  Hold on a second.  I can do two fists.  Trust me on this.  It'll be here in a second.  Two fists and a thumb.  We can all do two fists if we push down hard enough.  I actually have to use elastic to stretch my balls out.  If he does, Bob does two fists.  If you look at the back, his asshole is pink sucking because of the pressure.  He's pushing it out. 
[03:33:00]  He does two fists, but it's Rich Voss's hands.  You ever get a pink sock when you fuck your girl's ass?  You pull your dick out and that pink skin grips your cock like, get back here, you.  And there's a vein in it.  Enough about the pink sock.  You're going to hear our assholes saying it.  Get back here, you.  Here's your cock.  What's your hurry?  Anthony's big helmet.  Oh, all right.  I thought we were done.  Do we have time to do our theme news thing today? 
[03:33:30]  We got three stories about pets.  What do you like to hear about the drill and the dog?  The drill and the dog from Disney.  Right.  The drill and the dog.  Legless chihuahuas.  Douchebags.  Or cattail in the mailbox.  Let's talk about Anthony's cock.  That would be giant snake in the mailbox.  Fucking clipped snake.  Fat crowned snake in the mailbox.  Fucking thick crowned. 
[03:34:00]  Big lickable head.  I'm sorry.  Why does it keep coming back to this?  You think he has to take in extra calories every day just to keep his cock well fed?  Of course he does.  That's why if he was out in the freezing cold, the vital organs, his cock would stay toasty warm and his head would freeze off.  I think that's why Anthony has never been fat because, you know, all those extra calories are being used by the monstrous cock.  The monstrous.  Old shiitake cock.  Old nessy dick. 
[03:34:30]  Big fucking, big fat hunk of meat you call genitals.  Big lucky devil.  And I don't mean you, I mean your girl.  For getting a hold of that monster.  This should just have run its course.  Your cock has a handle.  It doesn't have a handle.  It should fold up, goes in its own alligator bag.  A bag made of alligator skin, which holds that giant appendage.  I bet you in a weird way, too, he's ashamed of it.  Like, he gets embarrassed.  Because when he was a little boy, they would call him Big Wee Wee Anthony. 
[03:35:00]  Big Wee Wee Anthony.  Special swim trunks for Anthony as a child.  They kicked him out of Little League because his cock was too manly and mature.  Shut up, Legal League.  But it would stick out both sides of the cup.  How are you going to do?  His boyish dick was always getting hit with ground balls because his ball bag and helmet would stick out of the sides of the fucking, he couldn't get a cup.  Right.  I had to go to the adult cup section.  Yeah, he had to play the outfield because he couldn't get down on those ground balls because his cock would kind of trip him up. 
[03:35:30]  He'd squat down and his fucking cock and balls would bulge out like he was having a miscarriage in his fucking baseball uniform.  He looked like a tranny in the outfield becoming bent down.  Come on.  Poor Anthony.  How could we possibly keep this subject going any longer?  You would think it would be a blessing, but I think in his case it wasn't a blessing.  I think there was a lot of shame.  There was a lot of shame.  A lot of shame involved.  Even when the first girls, when he showed it to them, they'd go, ooh, he'd go, yeah, I know, I'm sorry. 
[03:36:00]  No, no, it's a good thing.  I'm sorry.  Just a lot of hair.  Oh, yeah, it was awful.  Way before the days, you know, you learned you could trim that shit down a little bit.  He wanted the hair to grow longer so it would look smaller.  He would always wear like bulky, like fucking, like bulky winter pants in the summer so the pants came out farther.  And that fucking, and that hunk of meat dangling from the front of his torso looked more normal. 
[03:36:30]  His cock had to get its own flu shot.  Right in the crown.  Oh, shit.  He didn't even flinch.  I didn't flinch at all.  Motherfucker.  This never gets fully hard because it's too big.  There's not enough blood in his body to just fill the whole thing.  Every time he gets a hard on, he goes pale.  I do not.  His head gets smaller when his dick gets hard. 
[03:37:00]  What am I, a balloon?  People.  Right.  Right.  Fucking, just a fat helmet.  Giant fat crown.  Just a huge crown.  Well-pronounced crown.  It's well-pronounced.  It is jeans.  Through thick dungarees.  Dungarees.  You can see the crown through fucking two pairs of wranglers.  Like Magnum P.I.  How much cum do you think comes out of this monstrous cum?  It's probably an embarrassing amount of semen. 
[03:37:30]  Like he actually used to jerk off on a girl's face and then like try to like not finish cumming  because she'd go, oh my God.  I'm going to drown.  Yeah.  I've never seen this much cum.  Are you sick?  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  We're just thinking.  I'm just trying to sit here and do a show.  He had to carry a measuring cup when he fucked just so he could cum in that and fill it and  dump it out the window.  Just loads of cum.  It's so embarrassing.  Just filling up poor girl's eye sockets with load. 
[03:38:00]  Just gotta like, he's just gotta jerk off every five minutes to get rid of the poison.  It just keeps producing and producing and producing.  When he comes in a girl's mouth, Anthony's what they call a three-swallower.  He'll give you three fucking mouthfuls and you gotta swallow.  It's like eating fucking smooth chowder.  It sounds like the girl's in a beer drinking competition.  She's swallowing his dirty, huge load.  You can actually see his sperm like pad balls.  Are we done?  They're like fucking eels. 
[03:38:30]  You want to make a fucking sushi?  His sperm is actually not even clear.  It actually has like a color.  Like a gray color.  When he comes in.  All right, good.  It's finally over.  Thank you, Bob.  We'll start it back up.  We'll start it back up.  We'll start it back up.  Absolutely.  When he comes, it looks like a snake trying to swallow a mouse.  It looks like he took a garden hose and filled it with milk.  I bet you he can come without touching it. 
[03:39:00]  Like when he gets close, it probably just stands up.  It's very turgid.  And the fucking, it just starts pumping on its own and little bits start leaking all the  time.  And he has to just grab it.  And it's slick with pre-cum.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear that.  There you go.  There's his cock.  He's just a fat cock.  It probably just has to continue regenerating itself.  What is it now? 
[03:39:30]  Big pieces are just missing from all the goodness it gets.  I must assure you there's no pieces missing.  His cock actually sheds once a month.  Pieces fall off of the space shuttle.  And it keeps on ticking.  He has cock skins around his house.  Like fucking, one of those little bugs that curl up and shit.  I don't know.  Nice to meet you.  Hi, I'm happy.  Hi, Jesus.  Hi, hi.  Let's do line of the day.  Sure.  Who gives a shit about the pets? 
[03:40:00]  Especially when he shakes his big fat cock, it sounds like a cicada.  Old cicada genitals.  When he comes, it makes a noise.  People are suggesting, actually, I don't have a name on this, that the reason you drink  a lot is because your cock is your designated driver.  He gets a heart on a new wheel lock so he can't start the car.  Yeah, his dick is the club. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, jeez.  It sounded like a percolator.  It sounded like you were a chemist.  You can't pass the chemist.  Epstein?  Yeah.  It's the sound Anthony's cock makes when it comes.  All right.  Enough about the cock.  Cock gurgles.  Your cock hole has lips like a muck. 
[03:41:00]  You have a little bum chin on your dick.  When Anthony comes, it sounds like pea soup being dumped on tinfoil.  He's got to put tarp up all over the place because he doesn't want to mess up his brand  new drapes.  Just shoot it everywhere.  Looks like a Night Stalker murder scene with delicious cum.  He's got to focus or it just goes off like a garden hose after you turn it on.  Looks like somebody had a pie fight.  It's the worst thing I've ever drank is psyllium husk.  You really don't like that. 
[03:41:30]  Can I taste it?  I'm done, yeah.  I'll give you some.  Out of his ass.  That's what comes out of Anthony's cock, psyllium husk.  All right.  Pure psyllium husk.  Fucking Bobby.  Someone wants to know.  Chris asked from PA.  I didn't pay attention to the instant feedbackers today.  I apologize, but I just caught this one.  Chris asked from PA, writes, when it turns off in the toilet, how many times does he have 
[03:42:00]  to flush?  Psyllium husk makes a boy go doody.  It's a song I'm working on.  Let's go to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I wanted to know when Anthony comes, if his dick looks like a dead person being revival  paddles.  Good one.  At, um.  God.  Yeah.  Just walk away.  Just walk away. 
[03:42:30]  Just please walk away.  Jesus.  That was a psyllium husk of jokes.  Let's go to South Dakota.  Thank you.  What?  Hold on.  That got what it deserved.  I heard Anthony makes his girl wear arm floaties when she sleeps in the wet spot.  That is funny.  That is funny.  You know, how did we get here?  I don't know.  Your genetics.  I don't mean that.  Huge cocked Italian asshole.  Can you actually swim and cum? 
[03:43:00]  Uh.  No.  Not me.  Maybe just float.  You'd probably float due to the sodium content.  High salt.  It would be like the Great Salt Lake.  Mark B.  In Ohio, Ant's Cock was attacking ships in Pirates of the Caribbean, too.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's all right.  Do you wash your cocks separately?  He has to stay in the living room while it's in the shower.  Soap it up.  Singing. 
[03:43:30]  And he...  That's all it can do is whistle.  Yeah.  I mean, see, he doesn't want to get soap in the pee hole, so he puts the fucking cork  from a wine bottle in it.  He actually puts the...  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  Steve Elsbury from Albany writes,  That's when Anthony comes and his cock looks like Pat from Monaki in the Baby Bird video.  People are fucking ruthless. 
[03:44:00]  That's why Anthony has so many guns.  In case his cock fucking just goes ballistic one day.  I'll shoot it?  Is that what you're implying?  I have to shoot it?  Starts leaving Darth Vader helmet prints all over the house.  On the walls.  Starts waking up and doing things while you're asleep.  Yeah.  You hear slapping noise like...  Attacked a neighbor one night while you were sleeping.  Well, now it's getting ridiculously big, isn't it?  It's sneaking outside.  It's doing things. 
[03:44:30]  Who doesn't love exaggerated humor, though?  I have to shoot it.  Exaggerated humor rules.  I'll say it does.  It's coming like a fat man vomiting up eggnog.  That's wonderful.  He can't even wash it properly.  I bet your aunt's cock by the head smells like the underside of a foot.  Oh, God.  Hugh's lead bag from Wack Bag.  Ant shits out peanuts.  Peanuts as his cock constantly tries to feed it.  Showing hay up his own ass. 
[03:45:00]  That fucking...  That gift.  With that fucking fleshy gift.  Cock looks like an old sea turtle shell.  Fucking barnacles on the helmet.  God-given piece of enjoyment.  You want exaggerated humor.  Here you go.  Steve P. from New Hampshire.  Ant's cock has a rotating light on the end of it,  so ships won't crash into his balls.  It's not bad. 
[03:45:30]  Ant's cock has become self-aware.  Self-aware.  Hello, Joshua.  It's sperm are the size of trout.  Ant's cock.  Bear hang out at the end,  plucking it out of the stream to eat.  Steve, you mean.  Yes.  Steve O'more.  Ant's cock starred in Little Shop of Horrors as the plant.  No.  Enough about the cock.  Chester's liver, Anthony's Escalade, 
[03:46:00]  came with a free horse trailer for his cock.  Ant's cock killed a gay guy.  What?  That's a horse joke.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering.  We love the horse.  Was he gay?  No.  He wasn't.  He liked a male horse to fuck his ass,  but he was somehow hetero.  Figure that one out, gang.  Back to you.  Well, we could do this for another half hour, bud. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, bud.  But, uh...  When Ant gets blowjobs...  Enough about the cock.  Oh, my God.  I gotta go to this one.  Shane in Tennessee, go ahead.  When Ant gets a blowjob,  does it look like somebody blown into a didgeridoo?  Legally loggy.  Legally loggy.  It had potential.  Old didgeridoo cock.  Yeah.  Didgeridoo.  This is actual audio of Anthony getting blown.  There it is right here. 
[03:47:00]  He actually...  Oh, fucking A.  Hey, there could be worse things.  We could be doing an hour on how tiny your cock is.  That's right.  We're doing you a service, my friend.  That's right.  Didgeridoo.  Oh, no.  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia Beach.  Kevin.  Yeah, when Anthony dies,  they're gonna count the rings on his cock.  Yeah, what he was.  That's good.  Hang on.  Tim in Westchester. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, I was wondering if Anthony's house looks like the movie Alien  and with all that goo all over the place.  Jesus.  Here's your...  Spunkmeyer.  Get up here.  Anthony has a sleep number bed, and he likes it on 16.  His cock likes a 30.  That's how he tested it.  Like, instead of dropping the bowling ball with the wine glass on the other side,  he just smashed his fat, delicious appendage into the fucking top of the bed  and knocked the wine glass over. 
[03:48:00]  I thought game was over, but I gotta call it game on.  Oh, come on.  Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred.  We'll do this until they fall flat.  Go ahead, Fred.  Antleys is cocking the gutter to go bumper bowling.  Ryan at PA.  Ryan.  Yeah.  Antleys is cocking the gutter to go bumper bowling.  No, that would be implying my dick would be so big that airplanes might hit it. 
[03:48:30]  See, now it's gotten to the point of complete ridiculousness.  Well, Dave in Chicago.  Dave.  Yeah, I was wondering if Anthony was young,  they used his coming cat to whitewash defenses.  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  Frunkus?  All right, I think we might be going.  Frunkus?  The line of the day.  We might be going.  Chris in Atlanta.  Chris?  Ant's cock so big, there's snow on top of it.  All right, see, now he's saying that it's as big as a mountain  that has snow on its peaks. 
[03:49:00]  All right.  Ant, guys, that's not, that's not, don't exaggerate.  Ant's cock is so big that when you hold his balls,  the tip of it rests halfway up your forearm,  and you just go, my God.  But you don't yell at you, you just say it gently.  Hopefully not in that voice.  Yeah, exactly.  My God.  Can we fit the word comesies into this whole bit?  It's too cute. 
[03:49:30]  When Ant makes comesies.  Ant's cock is so big, it has like scars on it, like a whale.  What?  When boats are hitting it?  He just scrapes from girls' teeth,  smashing into his cock because it doesn't fit.  Coral?  Coral reefs?  Let me ask you honestly,  have you ever had a doctor, like when you go for the ball check,  like when you take your dick out,  have you ever had a doctor, like,  kind of lean back a little bit and go,  sweet Jesus.  The doc sits on his balls like a hippity hop  or a hoppity hip, whatever the fuck that thing is. 
[03:50:00]  No, that has never happened, Jimmy.  Have you ever had a doctor start to say something  and then catch himself, like, as soon as your cock comes out?  Oh, this is Anthony's cock.  I've been practicing medicine.  It's not on Ellen right now.  There's an anaconda on Ellen,  and it's not an anaconda.  Well, we were confused for a second.  Matt in D.C., what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if that was Ant's cock  in the Kevin Bacon movie, Tremor?  No, what happens is Anthony caught a doctor one time,  he took his cock out for the ball check,  and the doctor said, 
[03:50:30]  I've been practicing medicine for 25 years  and just stopped.  He just stopped himself.  Realized what he was saying?  He realized he was supposed to be thinking that.  Did you ever use your cock for T-ball?  No, I can say never.  That's a good one by Matt Lafarre from Queensbury.  Ant was circumcised with Alzar Cowey's knife.  Chris B. from Jersey,  Ant has to lock his cock in the basement 
[03:51:00]  during full moves.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I got to pee.  Yeah.  Why don't you just pee inside an ant's cock?  Me and my cock have to go to court.  Well, Puddle of AIDS writes that your cock has mile markers.  Is that true?  No, it doesn't have mile markers.  It would have to be over two miles long, I guess,  to need a mile marker.  Ant's cock is not like,  it's not an inhuman thing.  But as cock, 
[03:51:30]  here's the reaction.  Like, a lot of times a girl  will get her hand on it  and she'll strain and strain  and she'll go,  oh, if I go up by the tip,  I can touch my fingers.  That's all.  And no, I don't have to go to court  so the judge can use it as a gavel.  Good luck at court there.  Oh, thanks.  That's why they're pretty sure today, right?  No, I have a,  I brought clothes with me.  You brought court clothes?  I brought court clothes.  Not, you know,  up for murder charges,  court clothes.  Just neat. 
[03:52:00]  But you don't want to look like  you're a felon or something.  Ant's pee hole is so big,  it looks like a cornucopia.  There are various vegetables  tumbling out of it.  Just rest your huge mule on the table  at Thanksgiving.  Different colored corn cobs.  Matt from Pest Box Live  says,  Ant's cock is a grounds crew  to keep it from knocking down streetlights.  This is silly.  I'll try one. 
[03:52:30]  Ant's cock is so big  that the crabs are as large as lobsters.  No, I don't have crabs.  But if you did,  they would be the size of lobsters.  No.  You need light sticks to pee.  No, I don't.  You hear a beep, beep, beep.  They don't have to guide it in  like an aircraft.  God.  You do get a big mule, huh?  Is it a big,  just admit to it  and we might stop.  I just, you know,  I'm not going to make judgments 
[03:53:00]  on my own anatomy  as compared to anyone else.  Top Gunt from Canada  wants to know  if you use a tractor tire  for a cock ring.  Tractor tire?  Not even just a tire.  Tractor tire.  When Ant was circumcised,  they used his foreskin  to cover the Superdome.  Oh my God.  Ah, dude,  I can't give you credit  because it updated.  Fuck, that was good too.  That was a great one.  Ah, shit.  Sorry, bro. 
[03:53:30]  They're coming in so fast  I'd lost you already.  That wasn't mine.  Yes, I know.  And all they are here  on Pal Talk  is cock references.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Jurassic Come  from IRF.  He writes,  rednecks go noodling  inside Ant's pee hole.  That's a good one.  Noodle.  Jimmy went to the bathroom.  He's back  and it's still going on.  Oh, good.  Some guy just wrote,  all right, we get it.  He's got a big cock.  That's a great way  to end it.  No, the way to end it is,  all right, we get it.  He's got a gift. 
[03:54:00]  That's what that is.  Ant's cock is so big  it won't take Spielberg's calls.  Rob in Jersey.  Hey, wait a minute.  These are turning into  a Chuck Norris joke, sir.  Well, it's okay.  Ant's cock so big  he gets XM for free  off his...  All right, finally.  Let's just end it  right there  on that bomb.  You need to finish it.  All this was.  I'm not going to finish it.  Well, how about  we try to get back on track 
[03:54:30]  with Casper  from Connecticut.  Casper.  Good evening.  Ant's cock is bigger  than U.S. Steel.  Very good  Godfather 2 reference.  It was.  Very nice.  All right.  He likes the cruise vacations.  What?  You like the cruise ship  vacations  since he uses  the portholes  as glory holds.  John Ace from Montreal.  I just want to get  that.  Pat from Putnam. 
[03:55:00]  Pat.  Ant's cock is so big  his legs are jealous.  All right.  How do we end this?  He has a toenail  on his cock.  Oof.  That was all right.  That's how big  it has its own zip code.  Yes.  And that's how  you executive produce.  What?  Ah, it's a long story.  Yeah.  Long and tragic.  Like your cock.  I knew it. 
[03:55:30]  I knew it.  Hey, Jared  from West Virginia  writes,  Bob Kelly,  well, Ant's cock  is so big.  Yes, of course  you start with that.  Bob Kelly uses  Anthony's cock  to go,  what was it?  Snooba?  Snooba diving?  Snooba.  You and your stupid  Snooba.  Actually,  you just  hook your mouth  right under the head  of his cock  and you can go  around,  you can go down  around 20 feet  for a half hour.  Oh, shit.  What did I say?  Liberty.  What?  For my diabetes 
[03:56:00]  supplies.  There you go.  I got diabetes  and I'm a big fat fuck  with a walrus mustache.  Look at him.  I wish he'd fall  backwards into that  fireplace  and crackle  like a fucking  sugar-filled marshmallow.  It looks like your  cock before it gets  hard.  My cock does not  look like Wilford Brimley.  Big and fat  with a sweater.  It doesn't have  diabetes. 
[03:56:30]  It has to have  its own sweater  to keep it  warm.  Jesus Christ.  Enough about  the cock.  Hey,  this is Robert Kelly  and you're listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the  XM Sports Nation  College Basketball  Minute.  I'm Glenn Yunus  with your XM Sports  Nation College  Basketball Minute.  Three,  two,  one.  Dogs,  do the improbable, 
[03:57:00]  the unthinkable,  the unbelievable.  They beat Arkansas  and go wire to wire  to win the SEC  tournament.  The undermanned and  relocated Georgia Bulldogs  win the SEC in surprise  fashion over Arkansas  on Sunday.  It was a fantastic game.  Your number one seeds  handed out,  your brackets filled out,  number one as follows.  The North Carolina  Tar Heels,  the number one overall,  followed by Memphis,  UCLA,  and Kansas.  All those teams,  winners of their  conference championship.  As for your number two 
[03:57:30]  seeds in the NCAAs,  Tennessee,  Texas,  Georgetown,  and the Blue Devils  of Duke.  Maybe a small snub,  the Wisconsin Badgers,  they get in,  they win the Big Ten  tournament,  but they're only a three seed.  And that's the  XM Sports Nation  College Basketball Minute.

Lots of folks out there  are changing their own oil  on their late model GM vehicles  and of course,  these vehicles are equipped  with GM's  Oil Life Monitor System. 
[03:59:30]  To properly measure oil life,  the system must,  I repeat,  must be reset  after changing oil.  Here's how to do it  as per GM.  One,  turn the ignition key  to the run position.  Two,  fully push and release  the accelerator pedal  three times  within five seconds.  Three,  if the oil change soon  light flashes,  the system is resetting itself.  Start the vehicle  and the Oil Life Monitor  indicator will change  to 100%.  Should the change oil  soon light come back on  after going through  this procedure,  the system has not 
[04:00:00]  reset itself.  Repeat the procedure  and it should be reset.  If it doesn't,  the system must be scanned  for codes  and the problem  tracked down and repaired.

[04:46:00]  Singing drunken lullabies  Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess  Singing drunken lullabies  Singing drunken lullabies  And now, the worst flesh of Opie and Anthony  This show sucks 
[04:46:30]  It's awful  Holy shit, we're gonna get along with Michael Madsen  I'll tell you right now, man  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Bob Kelly in studio  And the great Michael Madsen  Yeah  Who just told us that he hasn't been in New York in five years  And he's thanking us right off the bat  Cause he got a free trip to New York  Because of our radio show  That's a pretty good deal as far as I'm concerned  It's kind of cold outside  But, you know, it beats the hell out of L.A.  Yeah 
[04:47:00]  You've been in L.A. for how long?  When I have to be there  Back and forth for about 14, 15 years now  Oh, shit  But you've been traveling, you were saying  I've been all over the world  I've been Ireland  And Bulgaria  Moscow  What the hell is there to do in Bulgaria?  I don't know where Bulgaria is  It's called employment, son  I have to go where I need to go  I'm more popular in foreign countries than I am in my own, so 
[04:47:30]  Is that the truth?  Come on  It seems that way  It's a little rough getting work nowadays  Why the fuck is that?  A lot of competition in Hollywood, you know  Michael Madsen, for fuck's sake  You know, the guy with the towel  And always does a scene with a towel on  I'm up against him, you know  And the other one, the Scientologist  And, you know, the rest of them  I mean, good lord, you know  Make some room for daddy 
[04:48:00]  But they're not very gracious about that  Believe me  No?  I mean, you know  They drive past me in the street with my legs amputated  To get to a meeting with Bruce Willis  You know  Oh, get it all out, Michael  Come on, let's get it out  Let's get it out  Then I meet Bruce on Sin City  And he started telling me about all these projects we're going to do together  Yeah  I'm like, yeah, sounds pretty good, Bruce 
[04:48:30]  Yeah, thanks for looking after me  Meanwhile, you know  A couple years later  You're going to Bulgaria  I see an astronaut farmer premiere  I'm like, hey, man  Remember all those projects you told me about?  He's like, what?  What projects?  Yeah, you know  What about the last Die Hard?  You could have been in that one  Oh, wouldn't that have been wonderful?  That would have really given my career a boost  I would have been the guy that he threw out the window  Jesus Christ 
[04:49:00]  In this scene, you light a cigarette  You fire a gun  And Bruce kicks you down a flight of stairs  No thanks, fellas  I'd rather pump gas  By the way  We're all huge fans of what you have done  Oh, yeah  And I just didn't expect this angle  And I'm loving it  No, it's not an angle  I understand 
[04:49:30]  I understand  It's the business end of the business  Blows  It just blows  People really knew what goes on behind the closed doors  Not to try to relate to a great actor like yourself  But, I mean, just doing radio  The bullshit we have to deal with  You're like, fuck you  You think it's all fun and games  And then behind the scenes, everything sucks  And management, they're assholes and everything  And it's got to be the same way in movies  They ruin, as far as where we sit  The greatest job you could have 
[04:50:00]  It's like, how do you ruin the greatest job you could have?  Goofing on shit  I was listening to you guys in the other room  And I went, which one of you got to take a shit?  I do  I just thought that was amazing  I never heard of a radio show like that  You should fuck this and fuck that  That motherfucker  I got to take a shit  Holy shit  And you're sitting there like  What the fuck?  And this is why  I'm sitting on these bleachers waiting to get in there  So they can talk about the shit they have to take  Great  We like to call it an open and honest show 
[04:50:30]  Yeah  I took a good shit before I left the hotel  Did you?  Yeah  Nice  It does make you feel good  It did  It's like a great way to wake up in the morning  Oh God, yeah  So I think I'm reading you  I'm ready for the day  I'm hearing  I'm ready to load up again  I'm getting the feeling that you  Jesus, this is so not what I expected  Oh shit, man  We just got done with Ben from Lost  Very accurate, very formal  Yeah  Yeah, sure, yeah 
[04:51:00]  Yeah, sure, yeah  Another exciting show  What will happen next?  Someone will get lost  Oh God in heaven  I'm going to bring a camera crew over to my fucking house  They want to make a reality show, I can tell you  Oh shit  No more singing than that shit  Michael's been, I can kind of sense  Don't even ask him  Michael's been through the mill  Yeah  As far as Hollywood goes  And a lot of people hide this stuff 
[04:51:30]  But they're a bunch of assholes over there  I mean, it's just the way it is  Oh, there's a lot of them that are nice  And I've had some great times  I've made some good pictures  I've been very lucky  Oh hell yeah  But, you know, 85% of it is horse shit  Yeah  Yeah, there's  It's too hard to  It's  I get more work on my own than I do  By, you know, playing the normal game of getting work  Really?  I've run into people at a party somewhere  And get a script  Or meet somebody that wants to do something 
[04:52:00]  And  You just scare the shit out of them  And they're like  Alright, I'll put you in a movie  Jesus  Well, it has a take to get in the elevator with me  But  Does it amaze you sometimes  When you look at the top grossing movie of the week  And go like  What the fuck is this country thinking?  Yeah, I kind of get that feeling  Especially with some of the pictures  That are nominated right now  It's very bewildering to me  Like what?  Which one in particular?  Oh, well, you see  The thing is  If I start naming certain titles  Those people will never hire me again 
[04:52:30]  Not that they would anyway  But  I am a bit mystified  By some of the things  That seem to be  That get an enormous amount of attention  In box office  It's amazing to me  Yeah, I don't know where  Because I'll look  I'll look at a trailer on TV  Or in the movie theater  And say  There is no way  I'll ever see this movie  I have no interest in seeing it  And then it's  You know, number one  Number two  Who the fuck  Who saw this?  You don't like Fool's Gold?  What? 
[04:53:00]  What?  Is that a movie?  We're just a bunch of lemmings out there  Because Fool's Gold  Is getting the worst ratings  Like as  You know  Reviews, whatever  And it was number one  At the box office  I'm like  Does anyone read?  No  Is there a scene in there  Where he wears a towel?  There's gotta be one  Right?  With the big knot in the front  And his hair's wet  Oh yeah  Of course  I mean  I did a picture in Ireland  I played an Irish-American prize fighter 
[04:53:30]  In a picture called  Strength and Honor  And it's the first time  I produced a picture  And I tried to get involved  In the distribution  And all that  And I learned a lot of lessons  About the way that  That stuff goes  And believe me  There's a lot of big money  Changing hands  Yeah  For promotional campaigns  And this kind of thing  And you know  The picture really got overlooked  And I'm trying to get some guys  To re-release it  But I think I'm up against  A stacked deck  I mean it's really hard to 
[04:54:00]  It's hard to make room  They don't make room  For anybody  You know  It's a very Dougie Doug  Thing  Yeah they got the thing  Figured out the way  They want it to make the most  And they don't want anybody  Changing the rules on them  Well as soon as I get in there  I'll be  I'll you know  Be saying  Telling them  That they're all  The greatest guys  In the world  You know  I was wrong  No I was just kidding  When I was on the radio  Holy shit  I've been nominated  Oh my god  He's living our life  Oh Jesus  I didn't mean  What I said about him  Get me a towel 
[04:54:30]  Get Michael a towel  I'll do a scene  With a towel  I'm scared  I'm scared  To ask him questions  About movies  He's been in now  I'm very lucky  And I've been very fortunate  Actually  I'm in a great industry  I really am  I'm just kidding around  With you guys  Someone threw you in  IMDB  And they're saying  Un-fucking-believable  You made 18 movies  For 2008 alone  Well I got six boys  To take care of  And you know  I need to keep  A lot of groceries  In the fridge  You have six kids?  Yeah  Yeah boys  Wow 
[04:55:00]  My house is like  Lord of the Flies  I actually saw  It was like theme days  Like one day  They'll all dress up  As cowboys  And Indians  They're running  Through the house  Spearing each other  And shooting arrows  At me  You know  It's amazing  I got a striped shirt  With a whistle  That's basically  My wardrobe  When I got home  Yeah  No it's just  It was the army day  The whole camel flies  Are in camis  They're out in the bushes  You know  Shooting paintballs  At each other  It's insane  I mean  I don't know  How my wife  She's amazing  She deals with it 
[04:55:30]  They tied her up  One time  Tied her to a  Tied her to a tree outside  You know  And she was like  My God  My God  Help me  I couldn't believe it  I mean  I always wish  I had brothers  Growing up  But now I got  All these sons  And it's just like  Amazing  The way they are  With each other  Yeah  I didn't miss  Fuck all  You know  I gotta ask the obvious  Have you ever done  Stand up Michael?  Huh?  Have you ever done  Stand up?  Uh  No  Nobody ever asked me that  I mean 
[04:56:00]  He's got like  He did stand up though  And so  If a heckler  Ever mess with him  If I did stand up  I always thought  That I would want  To do this thing  Where  One time  I was in my trailer  And I was making a movie  I was in  I was in Poland  And I was so  Fucking bored  I was going out  Of my mind  Right  I had a shit  In a bucket  Right  That's how  That's how low budget  It was  And  And I was just  Sitting there  Thinking  My God  Is this what it is  I was being eaten alive  By all these Polish insects  And 
[04:56:30]  You know  It was like  Four o'clock in the morning  And I was like  Oh my God  You know  I wish I was a lumberjack  This is so fucked up  You know  I just don't want to be  In this business  Why am I here?  And I started thinking  For some strange reason  About  A hotel that could open up  And they could call themselves  The Kevorkian  The Kevorkian Suites  And so you would check in  And they would have  All these different themes  In different rooms  Where you could go  To kill yourself  To die  Yeah 
[04:57:00]  To kill yourself  Yeah  Yeah  And so I was thinking  Oh man  I'm really on to something here  So  So I started writing it down  And I started thinking  Okay  Alright  In one suite  They call it  The Robin Given Suite  And when you go in  There's like a piece of glass  And  On the counter in front of you  Was a gun  And she's behind the glass  And she's going on and on  About her relationship  With Mike Tyson  And she just keeps going on  And on and on  And on about it  And she won't stop 
[04:57:30]  And you can't leave the room  Until finally  You know  You either shoot yourself  In the head  Or keep on listening to her  And  And I  I thought another one  Would be like  You  You go in  And when you go in  They inject you  And put you to sleep  And then there's a big  Metal sliding door  On the other side of the room  And when you wake up  The door comes open  And there's a big gorilla  Standing there  And then you suddenly realize  You have bananas  Around your neck  On a chain 
[04:58:00]  Right  And you're like  Oh Jesus Christ  Oh my God  Fucking hell  And you grab hold of him  Because you want to give him  To the ape  But you realize  They're made out of plastic  And he's just coming at you  You know  And he's going to rip you apart  Do you smoke a lot of weed  That's hysterical  You just gotta get  You think about certain things like that  Why not  That's what you think about in Poland  When you have to shit in a bucket  Shit in a bucket  And Polish bugs are eating you  And you're waiting to go on the set  To play something  And it's 
[04:58:30]  And you said  Shit in a spackle bucket  So I was in construction  You have to do that  Right  Anyway  That's it for my stand-up career  Damn  That would go over  That's it  I'm not going to ask you  About the greatest scene  In Reservoir Dogs now  I don't want to know  The sarcastic answer to that  Oh actually  That's probably  What you're asked the most anyway  Right  You're probably sick  Of talking about that scene  No not really  I mean I'm lucky  To have anything  That anybody wants 
[04:59:00]  To talk to me about  I could be  You know  Digging ditches somewhere  But I  How was it  Working with Quentin  We had him on the show  And we were just amazed  By the guy  He's a nut  If I cured cancer  And I was at a news conference  And they were asking me  About my findings  Most likely  Someone would stand up  And say  That's great  About the cancer thing  Michael  But what's it like  Working with Quentin  Right  Yeah  Exactly  Just let him  Just let him talk 
[04:59:30]  He's a great guy  He's a genius  And they  Wow he can talk though  Huh  Yeah  Yeah he can go on  But at least it's interesting  Yeah  He's kind of a film historian  The guy  I mean he's got about  335mm prints of movies  In his garage  And  Those film nights  Those themed  Film nights and stuff  Yeah he's got a regular theater  In his house  With the curtains  And a popcorn machine  And the whole fucking thing  You know after our interview  With him we felt like  We were going to be invited  Over to movie night  Oh did you  You know how you told  That story about Bruce 
[05:00:00]  And he's like  Yeah next time you're in LA  Give us  You know give me a call  But the problem was  He never really  Won exchange numbers  He's hard to nail down  I mean  When I did Kill Bill  It was only because  I drove it to his house  And I knew the gate code  And I just went  And I sat by the pool  And I waited for him  To get home  You know  I sat there for like  Two hours  And finally he showed up  I'm like Quentin  What the fuck is going on  Did I need a job man  You know  What are you doing  And then he whipped out  The Kill Bill script  And fuck 
[05:00:30]  Which is  I was playing Bud  But Jesus  If I had to wait  For him to call me  I mean it never would have happened  It never would have worked  Kill Bill gets just better  And better  The more you watch it too  It's just one of those movies  You never get sick of  Yeah I think a lot of people  Oh my gosh  Great time man  That was a wonderful experience  That was really  One of those pictures  That stands out in your mind  You know  Quentin's got a good way  Of pulling people out  Of relative obscurity  Like then came Bronson  You know  Michael Parks  Yeah  Michael Parks is hysterical  Hey  He was wonderful  He was great  What the hell no  Now it's obvious  To ask Michael 
[05:01:00]  About some of the great roles  He's been in  What was the biggest piece of shit  You were involved with  I think this is the way to go  With this interview  I'm thinking  This show  Oh damn  Holy shit  We got a new promo  Yeah  Put that in the  Put that in the fucking intro  To the radio show  Oh shit  All right  Now that I'm completely uncomfortable 
[05:01:30]  That's great  Oh fuck that  That's fantastic  And I also took notice  You know  Fuck it  We're letting it all out  He comes in  And I go  Hi I'm Opie  And he gave me a look  Like  What a stupid name  I was just trying to figure out  If you were the one  That had to take a shit  I saw it in his eyes  I'm like I know  I've been stuck with his dumb name  Since I was 12  Will you give me a break  You just changed it man  All in his eyes  I didn't change it  He didn't even have to say anything  I just saw it in his eyes  It's like  Change the name man 
[05:02:00]  I would love to  We're just nine for  What ridiculous fucking radio shows  Do you have to do  You know  I met Ron Howard once  And I called him Opie  He never hired me  I thought it was  I thought it was going to be funny  You know  And I was like  Hey Opie  I thought  You know  I thought he would take it  In the right way  But he doesn't appreciate it  He doesn't know how to take a joke  He probably says  Something like  If I cured cancer  People would  You won't see me  In any Ron Howard films  Put it that way  That's how quick 
[05:02:30]  It can end for you  Hey what about this  Do you want to talk about  The new movie  I don't even know  Boarding Gate  Listen  I shot that picture in Paris  I played a stockbroker  With a girlfriend  Who was a dominatrix  I saw  Moans and groans  I saw half of it  Rowan gave me the movie  And I watched it last night  But halfway through  The fucking DVD  Gave me  It had a scratch  What  But it was right  The movie  Where did it end 
[05:03:00]  The scratch  Right when you were about to get  Right before  She pulled the gun out  And you were about to get killed  Oh good  Oh so he gets killed  Thanks Bob  Thanks for giving that away  Good one Bobby  That's wonderful  I don't know  I don't know if he got killed  That's what I'm saying  I didn't see it  She pulled the gun out  Honestly God  I pulled the gun out  And they would  But the sex before that  It was this big lead up  So they were doing all this  Kinky shit dude  I don't know  She pulled the gun out  There was handcuffs  He had a belt around his neck  It was one  And I was watching it  With my wife  And it's

[05:06:00]  Over the face  Bobby has given this movie  A better plug  Than anyone else could  I know I didn't even  Have to be here  The scene in the front  When you're in your office  Is so fucking  It's so back and forth  I never get to do  A picture with a girl  I'm always beating  Somebody up  Or smoking a cigarette  Or shooting a gun  And I never get to  Do any love scenes  You know  Love  I never get to  I don't think  I'm going to ride off  Into the sunset  With the girl 
[05:06:30]  You know  I was really happy  When they gave me the part  It was my chance  To break my  Stereotype  You know  You had a  You had a great love  Ruined my reputation  What was the love scene  He got a girl  He fucked her  Oh my god  He had a belt  He didn't kill anybody  He didn't shoot anybody  What's going on  What was the love scene  He had where he's  Fucking the dude's wife  As he's in the  In the  Oh was that  Fucking hysterical  Love scenes  Getaway  Getaway  Loved getaway  Just shuts the door 
[05:07:00]  In his face  What are you looking at  That was one of the most  Despicable scenes  What are you looking at  You fucking  Yeah he's basically  And she's all into it  He's just fucked  He's a nerdy dude  Tied up in the bathroom  As Michael's banging his wife  I love that scene by the way  But in his business  It was such a good fuck  That the guy  He kills himself right  He hung himself  Yeah  He hanged himself in the bathroom  That was one of those  Really hot  But disturbing scenes 
[05:07:30]  Because  What a way to go  You're thinking of it  But then you're like  Jesus Christ  What if you're in that situation  And you're not the fucking guy  Fucking the broad  You're the one chained to the toilet  Or whatever  Me and your old lady  Come in the next room  Yeah  And she's enjoying it  Oh  You haven't seen that scene Bobby  I've seen it  But that's one of those things  Where you  The verbal  Saying that out loud  Makes you go  Ah  Yeah  Just the way he just said it  Awful  And she's coming  It's a remake  It's a remake of a Sam Beckenpour picture 
[05:08:00]  Yeah  The getaway right  But you know what he has in this movie too  Which a lot of movies he does  Back to boarding gate  Certain actors  Like Robert Duvall does it  And there's certain actors  That do this business  Like stuff that's not in the  You know it's in the script  And it's just him doing it  There's one part he ate  He was eating this food  And he makes the fucking  Just him eating it  It's just so interesting  And then he just  He has like an olive pit in his mouth  And he's delivering his line  And he just goes  Spits it  Into the sink 
[05:08:30]  It's like  You know he's just like  Holy shit  Cause you get  When you're an actor  You get a script  You just read the lines  You do the things  You know he just went  Oh sure  Look that's the fun of it  You know  I think  I try to get away with  Things like that  As much as I possibly can  I mean that's why  You know a guy like Quentin  Even a guy like Olivia  For boarding gate  I mean they both  Gave me that  Gift of being able to be  On the spot  And in the moment  And let something happen  Just cause it happened  Not because it's on the page 
[05:09:00]  That's a lot better for me  It's a lot easier for me  It's a lot freer way to work  When I cut that ear off  You know I walked over  To the side of the room  And I was holding  I was looking at it  And I was thinking in my head  What am I gonna do  With this fucking thing  Right  I got this fucking ear  In my hand  What am I gonna do  You know  And they're rolling right  So I'm just holding  And I'm thinking  Okay  What am I gonna do  And Quentin's over  On the side  And he's going  Toss it  Throw it to the ear  Michael  Throw it away  Michael  Throw it  Throw it  And I'm thinking to myself  I don't want to throw it yet 
[05:09:30]  You know  And so I spoke into it  I said  Hey can you hear me  And then I threw it  Fucking twisted  And so Quentin's like  I can't believe you did that  And I'm like  What do you mean  He goes  No no no  What are you doing  You're talking in the ear  And then to the next day  He goes  Michael  Listen  We went to saw the dailies  You know  And you know  When you're talking in the ear  It's staying in the movie  It's such  Yeah  That's awesome  It's such a  Cause only  I'm just kidding around  Only a fucking lunatic 
[05:10:00]  Would do something like that  And the character's  Obviously out of his mind  Yeah  Hey can you hear me  I figured you know  It was the thing to do  I mean if you're gonna have it  It just made sense to me  At the most  I  We were talking to Quentin  I can't dance  So I had to come up with something  We were talking to Quentin  About that movie  And that scene  In Reservoir Dogs  And one of the  One of the most  I don't know  The one with the most impact to me  Is when you walk outside  Of that funeral parlor  And it  You hear the birds chirping 
[05:10:30]  Kids are playing  Kids are playing  And it's such a stark difference  From the horror  That is going on  Behind those doors  Like for a moment  You're out of it  And you're just outside  It's a beautiful day  Going to get the gas  Yeah going to get the gas  To burn them with  But  That was my car  That yellow Cadillac  It's on Ebay  Really your car  I put it on Ebay  It's up for sale right now  Get the fuck out of here  Really  That was my car  I drove it to the set that day  And that's where I parked it  And  I swear to god 
[05:11:00]  When we were going to shoot  The scene  They were going to go to budget  And rent a car  For Mr. Blonde  For the thing  Where the cop's in the truck  And I said  Why  Why don't we just use my car  It's right there  And Quinn says  Oh that's a good idea  Let's just use your car  So when I walk out  And the caddy's there  I mean that's because  That's how I parked  When I came to work that day  That's on Ebay  I've had the damn thing  For about 15 years  How much do you want for  What do you want  For the instant  I don't know  I think John Schneider  Got 4 million bucks  For the Dukes of Hazzard 
[05:11:30]  Chargers  You're looking for  4 million  I don't know  Anything's possible right  You never know  I mean you know  I won't have to go back  To Bulgaria  To go to work  Fucking Bulgaria  What is going on  Why is Michael Madsen  In Bulgaria  Doing a movie  Well you know  Paramount hasn't called lately  Well you're going to be  In Sin City too right  Well if they ever  Get around to making it  I'm supposedly going to be in it  Robert Rodriguez told me  If I did the first one  And it did well  That he'd bring me back  For the second one 
[05:12:00]  So you know  With those guys  You just kind of have to wait  Until they're ready  I mean there's no use  Calling him  If he wants you  He's going to ring you up  So I hope I do  It was a great picture  It was a lot of fun  Doing that thing  And the one thing  Talking about  Just reading lines off a page  And then doing the things  That make a great actor  Different from someone  Just reading lines  The facial expressions  You can make  You don't have to say words  And that's a talent in itself  Like you can make a look 
[05:12:30]  And just go  Oh my god  This person is so fucked  This person is so fucked  Just from a look  It comes from a nefarious childhood  Is that it?  Yeah  Sometimes it's just out of boredom  You didn't have any  Professional training or anything?  Third or fourth take man  You gotta come up with  Nothing like that  Just kind of  I tried to  Early on  I went to Steppenwolf Theater  In Chicago  I tried to take  A scene study  Classes there  For a bit 
[05:13:00]  And I just  Kind of fell out of it  I'm a very impatient  Young man  And I just wanted  To get on with it  And I figured  If this is what I'm going to do  I'm going to do it  I don't want to be  A career student  And you know  God bless anybody  Who's studying  I'm not trying to  Take anything away from them  It works for them  That's fine  But for me  I just didn't understand  All the sense memory business  You know  Pretending that this  Fucking thing is  Boiling hot  Or you know  Pretending that I'm  Blowing in the wind  Or something  It was really kind of  I didn't really need  That whole thing  And I didn't figure 
[05:13:30]  I was going to end up  Playing Hamlet anyway  So you know  You want to  You want to  Fan of the Meisner technique  I just wanted to  Get on with it  So I really kind of  Sidestepped all that  And  How'd you break in?  What was like your first  What was the first role  You did where you  And wow  I think I'm doing this  For a living now  I went to  Well first I came to New York  I met Sergio Leone  When I was here  Wow  And he told me  I should pursue  An acting career  And he had a film  He wanted me to do  But then unfortunately  He died  So I went to L.A. 
[05:14:00]  And I  Had 400 bucks  I got a job  Pumping gas  At the Union 76 station  In Beverly Hills  And  You know  My first customer  Was Fred Astaire  I swear to God  It was on Christmas Eve  And Fred Astaire  Fucking pulls in  With a flat tire  On his car  And I'm like  This kid from Chicago  And I'm like  Holy shit  Oh my god  Fucking god  In heaven  It's him  You know  It's him  You know  He gets out of the car  And he pops me off 
[05:14:30]  A hundred dollar bill  And I says  Look it's 12.50  For the flat  You know  And he just walks off  And I'm like  Holy Christ  You know  And my  My boss  Comes over to me  And I says  Jesus Christ  Is that him  And he goes  Oh yeah  Get used to it kid  Those guys  Come in here  All the time  And they sure did  Boy  I mean  I've seen  Everybody  I didn't realize  I was right in the middle  Of Beverly Hills  And so  Over the next  Nine or ten months  That I worked there  I seen everybody 
[05:15:00]  Come in there  For gas  At one time  Or another  And it was pretty amazing  And I finally met a girl  And she knew a guy  And so and so and so  And so and so  And they knew an agent  And this and that  And this and that  That's how it works  And I went  And I read for  An episodic television show  Called St. Elsewhere  And um  I  When I went to the thing  I had to go to work  And I was figuring  I was going to be late  So when I went  To read for the part  I had my Union 76  Outfit on  Because I was going  To work right  And uh  So I went in  And I read

[05:20:30]  You know  Breaking into houses  And stealing  Horrible turntables  Sure  Oh god  I stole a turntable  Of a church  One time  Jesus  I did  I swear to god  I went to this  Youth group  You know  They had a youth  Lounge  You know  And they had  Really bitching  Stereo in there  And so  You know  Like a couple  Nights later  I went over there  And I took the  Damn thing  And I put it  Outside in the  Bushes  Underneath the  Yeah you had  A stash at first  Yeah a stash  Exactly  Yeah 
[05:21:00]  You know how it goes  Yeah  How do you know  See you're just like me  I used to do that  You understand the mentality  Same stuff  I went back and got it  You know  And I put it in my room  And you know  You have to let the heat  Blow over and see if  See if like anyone  Was on to it  Yeah  And found it  Where you stashed it  Or something like that  And scratched it up a little  You know  Yeah  I found it  Yeah  I found it  Look at this thing  I found it  I can't believe it  When you realize  The heat's not on  I took a bike  I was going to  Dana Hills High School  When I lived out in California  And I used to walk home 
[05:21:30]  And I didn't want to  Fucking walk  So I went to the bike rack  And just grabbed the bike  And I rode the bike  And I stashed it in the woods  Kind of under some shit  Where we used to go  With the horses  And as we were going through  One day I went  Hey wait a minute  What's that  And they go  Holy shit a bike  I found a bike  And my father goes  My father goes  Alright  We gotta call the police  So they can take it down  To the police station  To see if it was stolen  No dad  So I'm like  Yeah  I was like  Oh  Yeah  Yeah let's do that  They took it down there 
[05:22:00]  The cops told me  If it's not claimed  In three months  It's mine  Three months  And three months later  No one claimed it  So it was mine  I felt bad about the church thing  You know  But then again  The whole reason I did it  Was because the priest  Was like hitting on my mom  You know  Jesus  At least it wasn't  Hitting on you  That was  Exactly  It was worse  Then I would have  Burnt the place to the ground  With him in it  Okay  I had to wait  Until he was in there  Doing his spiel  And set the whole  Fucking place on fire  And burnt that 
[05:22:30]  Motherfucker up  With the whole place  It was bad enough  He was hitting on my mom  Okay  We're out there  Singing the hymns  And he's hitting on my mom  Okay you fuck  Guess what I'm gonna do  Later today  I'm gonna rip off  Your youth lounge  Okay  I'm taking your  Stereo system  You freak  That was completely justified  You freak motherfucker  Put it on your mom  Yeah come on  You know  That's not right  What's he doing  He's supposed to be a man of God  He's like hitting on my mom  That is not right  Jesus Christ  Wow 
[05:23:00]  I'm glad I stole that God name  Is he the most intimidating guy  We've ever had on the show  I love him  Jesus Christ  Top of the list  Most intimidating guy  Right here man  Open and honest  No shit  I'm a dad with six kids  And I  You know  I'm really  You know  I play dangerous people  But I'm  I actually saw an interview  With you  Where they showed your house  In Malibu  And your kids  Yeah  Yeah you actually  You were just this nice  Peaceful guy  Almost like  It was almost  Well he writes poetry right 
[05:23:30]  Yeah  Do a little poetry  Not lately  I kind of got over that  I got over it  It was fun for a while  I wrote a lot of stuff  And then finally one day  I just figured that's it  I got nothing else to say  I mean  I wrote a couple of books  And that's it  You know  I really  I'm going to repeat myself  The leaves were blowing  Across the driveway  Frank Sinatra's dead  You know  What am I going to do now  You know  I'll have another shot of whiskey 
[05:24:00]  I'll light a lucky strike  And take a walk in the rain  You know  Thinking about Frank  You know  It's like  Oh Jesus Michael  God  What the hell are you writing  It was fun while it lasts  That was actually kind of good  It conjured up an image  It really did  It's available  He's got an actual book out  It's on Amazon.com  Yeah  Conjures up an image  Do you  You drink  Or  Give that up  You know 
[05:24:30]  Once upon a time  You know  When I was  Younger  That was definitely  The thing to do  I mean  I think I probably  Well sure  I mean  I never  Lost my mind  But  Sure  Yeah  You know  I mean  It's  You just  You got to know  When to say when  You have to wait  Till  You have to wait  Till after work  Put it that way  Oh  Did you ever  On the job  You ever drink on the job  No  It's kind of dangerous 
[05:25:00]  Especially if you have to  Jump out of a Hummer  Onto the  Flatbed truck  Or you got to fall  Through a plate glass table  Or you're shooting off guns  You know  You better be careful  And you can't be  Hammered  And that's how  Accidents happen  Yeah  Who the hell  Is that one guy  It happens every so often  Yeah  Oh  John Eric  Hexham  Yeah  That's a perfect example  Yeah  He had a  Blank gun  Put it against his temple  And pulls the trigger  And you're still getting  The same force  Coming out of the barrel  And the  Thing  Put a piece of bone  Right through his brain  Yeah 
[05:25:30]  What the hell are you doing  It's a gun you idiot  A movie set can be  A dangerous place  So you got to be careful  You got to know  What you're doing  Yeah you handle a lot  Do you shoot guns at all  Real life  I got a  I got a Winchester pump  I got a 12 gauge  Shotgun  Home security  Keep talking  Making Anthony hard  I love that shit  Yeah it's a nice gun  Winchester pump  Yeah  Look at Anthony  The gun actually used to  Belong to Steve McQueen 
[05:26:00]  Oh wow  Holy shit  It's the one that he used  In the getaway  You know when he goes  In the gun shop  And he gets the shotgun  He takes the shells  He puts them in his pocket  He wraps it up in paper  He goes outside  And he tells the cops  To lay down in the street  And he's like  Blasting the squad car  In slow motion  Sam Peckinpah  He kept  He kept that gun  And he really liked that one  And years later  I became friends  With his son Chad  And me and Chad  Were hammered one night  It was my birthday 
[05:26:30]  And I was over at Chad's  And he knew that I was  A big fan of that picture  And he gave me the shotgun  He gave me Steve  Wow  That's a fucking present  Jesus Christ  Yeah  Yeah it kind of was  It kind of was  That's a nice thing  To have around the house  There's a guy  Who's like career  Transcends time  There are people now  That are huge McQueen fans  That weren't even alive  When he died  Steve was much too young  To go away  But God  What he left behind  Yeah  Great movies  Yeah well  There was a different time  And there was a different 
[05:27:00]  Kind of directors back then  And there was a whole  Different mindset  Yeah  Sometimes I think  I was born in the wrong era  Yeah  A little earlier  It would have been  A little better  Yeah  Yeah  I mean the guys  Like Peckinpah  And some of those cats  You know  They're making  Some pretty good pictures  That was some sick shit  Peckinpah man  It's like  Yeah this isn't graphic enough  Let me slow it down  To see shit  Flying out of their backs  He's up in the crane  With a tumbler of vodka  You know  Yeah  A bar on the set 
[05:27:30]  Those were the days right  Yeah  Made some great movies  Yeah  Yeah he sure did  I know his godson  Joseph Culp  He's Robert Culp's son  Oh yeah  Told me some good  Peckinpah stories  Yeah  He told me that  When they did  When they were doing  Wild Bunch  That at lunch break  Ben Johnson  And Bill  And I guess  They took some chickens 
[05:28:00]  And they buried them  In the ground  With only their heads  Sticking out  Of the top of the dirt  Jesus  And then they were all  Get back with their rifles  And they were going to  Take a target shot  And see who could  Blow their heads off  But the chickens  When they're buried  In the ground  They go like  They fell asleep  Their heads just go like  This like they're dead  And they just fall asleep  And they're like  Oh man this ain't  Going to be no fun  They're going to  Pop their heads off  But they're all  They're sleeping  You know  This isn't right  Right  That isn't right  And so apparently  If they're up  Clunking  That's perfectly fine 
[05:28:30]  But sleeping  That's not right  So apparently  Mr. Peckinpah  Jesus Christ  Come on  Apparently Sam  Sam Peckinpah  Apparently him  Or maybe it was Warren Oates  One of the two of them  Apparently went over  To the sleeping chickens  And squirted  Zippo lighter fluid  On all their heads  Oh my god  It woke them up  Yeah  And they were awake then  Man  And  And then 
[05:29:00]  I guess then the shooting began  So  The target practice commenced  After that  So  And they had to put them  Out of their misery  Then it was humane  Right  Of course  Jesus  Their eyes are stinging fire  Holy shit  Boy  It certainly was a different time  Yeah  Boy  Was the humane society person  On set that day  No  I don't think those folks  Were around me  Yeah  Probably not  My god  Wow  How many god damn stories 
[05:29:30]  Must you have  Holy shit  Right above  We've been here for a long time  Yeah  Yeah  We're supposed to be talking  About boarding gate  Yes  The movie was  The half of the movie  That I saw was  All right  You saw half the movie  Don't make it sound like  Did you see it  The half that I saw  No I got it in my pocket  Right now  I saw it  So shut your face  I got a screener copy  I'm not in the other half  So it's fine  Michael  We like  Talking about the half  He was in  We like to be prepared  For these interviews  Obviously  And Roland  He didn't do the job  He hands out these movies  On Valentine's Day  And we all got girls 
[05:30:00]  And he also handed out  A movie that was broken  So halfway through  He calls me  He goes  I want to deliver the movie  Because you know  You got Michael Madsen  Coming in tomorrow  I'm like dude  I'm going to dinner  In a half hour  So I apologize  But the synopsis  It's a story about  A sexy ex-prostitute  Who's forced to flee London  After a steamy S&M encounter  You saw that right Bob  That part  Yeah there's a couple  Steamy  Put the debt ridden  Ex-lover  Ends in violence  That's Madsen playing  The ex-lover  She flees to Hong Kong  And becomes involved  With a couple  Who promise to help her 
[05:30:30]  Get her papers and money  But nothing turns out  The way it was supposed to  And the ex-prostitute  Ends up trapped  In a sordid game  Of manipulation  You don't sound like  The trailer guy  Wow  It's heavy man  It's the sexiest  Sex scenes  It sounds like  A movie I would enjoy  I mean it's just sexy sexy  And you review  Your own movies  Directed by Olivia Esaias  Who's a great  Great director  Great director  Yeah  One of my favorite scenes  Is when you're eating your food  And she's trying to  Fuck with him  And he takes a tomato 
[05:31:00]  And just sticks it in her face  And she slaps it out of his hand  But you know  It wasn't in the script  She's talking  You know she's annoying him  He takes it to me  And just sticks it in her face  It's like what?  Oh you've done that before  What guy hasn't done that?  Just mush a tomato in her face  And he just starts laughing  Because she's angry  You know as an actor  She really was pissed  Like what are you fucking doing?  And he's like  His little laugh  His laugh he does  He's like  That right there  She's a wonderful girl  I really liked working with her 
[05:31:30]  I wish we would have  Had more stuff to do together  I mean she's a great little girl  How great is it  When he'd be great together  In another film  I hope somebody finds  A script for us  How great is it  When he does laugh  In some of these movies  Like maniacal  That's what I'm saying dude  The scariest part about him  Is when he's laughing  Right  That's when you're scared of him  That's when I  He starts laughing  You're like  Oh shit  I pissed him off  Sure  But can I ask you a question though  Doing a scene with that  Like regular sex scenes  In these movies  You can tell it's choreographed 
[05:32:00]  And everything  But this looked really improv  What you guys were doing  Because I  I mean did you get  I mean she's smoking  Did you get  I mean how did  The first time I seen her  She was sitting in a window  And I was walking by  This little courtyard in Paris  And I seen her sitting there  And I had peach in my hand  And so I  I give her the peach  Through the window  And I went on the set  And then when I got there  I was waiting for her to come in  And she comes in  And she's got a fist like this 
[05:32:30]  And I was like  What's she gonna do now  And she goes like this  And she opens up her hand  And she's got the pit  In her hand  You know  And she ate the whole  Fucking thing  And um  I realized  She's holding a can of beer  With a  With a napkin around it  And she's got a straw in it  And I said  Listen  I really like this girl  You know  I mean  It was a great introduction  You know what I mean  There was a lot to be said  For that first impression thing  Sure 
[05:33:00]  And there was a lot of things  In the script  That just said  You know  They begin to do this  And they simultaneously climax  And all these kind of things  So they write this kind of stuff  But they don't  The writer doesn't really  Realize that you actually  Have to do that  And so  I think she was game enough  To just  You know  And Olivia was game enough  To just run the camera  And if I just know  What my parameters  Of the room are  Where I can go  Out of frame  And in frame  I think it's always better  To just kind of  Just make it up as you go 
[05:33:30]  And that's what we did  You can tell man  There's one point  Where he  She says  You're staying  And you know that  And she's like  He goes  Say yes  She goes  Yes  And he goes  And I'm putting handcuffs on you  And I'm fucking you  And she goes  Yes  My dick  Filled up  And I'm trying to hide it  From my wife  Because I don't want her to know  That I want to tie some bitch up  And make her my slave  And then slap tomatoes  In her face 
[05:34:00]  Remember when Jimmy Cagney  Put that grapefruit  In the  Oh classic  Yeah  I mean come on  He did it before I did  Just smushed  Yeah  Smushed that thing  Right in her face  Nothing better than  Mushing something  In the chick's face  So much better than  Hitting her  Food  Are you hungry here  Stick her face  With a bowl of porridge  Eat this  Come on eat it  Eat it  Do it now  Oh Christ  Eat this fucking thing too  I hate to say it  I hate to say it  But we're getting the wrap up song  Running out of time  I hate this 
[05:34:30]  Okay guys  Listen thanks a lot for having me  Please  Are you kidding  I love New York City  It's really  It's cool to be here  Can we have your number  Like when we're having a slow show  We'll just call you  Call you up man  Jesus Christ  I can't do that  His opinion of the show  Hasn't changed  I'll be at Quentin's  Trying to get a job  You're trying to get a job  You're fitting perfect  With this fucking show  I love it  Maybe I should  Maybe I have  Future employment in radio 
[05:35:00]  Yeah I think you do  Listen if the movies  Don't work out with me  I'll be back  Yeah  You guys are a lot of fun  We'll have Roland  Get in touch  And that way  You can give us  A quick call or something  When it comes out  And of course  Michael  Michael  Madsen dot com  And someone was telling me  You review your own movies  That's got to be weird  I kind of figured  I had to make an excuse  For some of the crap  I've put out there  You know  There's a lot of stuff  In there  That you know  I just  I figured I needed  To explain myself  And I don't want anybody  To think that I'm thinking  It's all wonderful  Like which one? 
[05:35:30]  I think there's  I made about 74 pictures  You make your own  I think there's about  15 of them  That are really good  And I think there's  Probably about 25  That are okay  And nobody ever  Lost any money on me  But some of them  I did to pay the mortgage  You know  Wait a minute  Is this you  Suggesting what to see  And what not to see  Of your own movies?  Yeah  Wait go up  He's got  You got to go to  MichaelMadsen dot com 
[05:36:00]  This is amazing  That was a while ago  He recommends movies  Recommend if you could  Find it movies  Watchable  Watchable movies  Are these all movies  You're in  Or just movies in general?  No they're the ones  I'm in  Watchable  You're in Choke?  Yeah I did that  With Dennis Hopper  That's based on  The Polinook  No they stole  The title from us  I did the original Choke  Okay  With Dennis  And then Watchable  And then it gets down  To Skip It  His own movies  He's telling you  Skip It  And then he goes down 
[05:36:30]  To Unwatchable  Holy shit  And he lists the ones  That are just  Completely unwatchable  And then  Can't rate  Never seen it  So there's something  You've never even seen  That have been in the movie  You've never seen it  You've got a category  Can't rate  Never seen it  Have you ever seen  A more honest  Fucking actor?  Holy shit  Jesus Christ  No wonder you're not  Getting work in the United States  Exactly  You see  You see how that shit works  How about you don't burn a bridge?  I'm gonna hire him  No fucking way  He's an indie guy 
[05:37:00]  Yeah  Okay man  Here's an example  You gotta  You gotta go to his website  It's better than this interview  Flat Out  Which is one of the movies  Was it a movie?  I don't even know  Yeah it was a picture  It's in the section  Can't rate  Never seen it  And this is a one line  He gives for Flat Out  Interesting film about  A paralyzed motorcycle race  Shot in two days  As a favor to the producer  It's like  It's like helping someone move  That's kind of exactly  What it was  It's like 
[05:37:30]  Either move a couch  Or make a movie for today  If I hadn't have done it  I would have had to move  It was time to pay the rent  Man you know  That is  What are you gonna do  Dude  Wow  Oh that's fantastic  Alright here's another one  You know I gotta do this  Ghost  I know you gotta go  But this is too good  Ghost  He explains it this way  Low budget movie  Made during a time  I was trying to pay my mortgage  Also released as  Code of the Dragon  Trying to pay the mortgage  Holy fucking honesty 
[05:38:00]  Yeah I could have said  A few more things  About that piece of shit  You know  When you come back  My kid who's the lead  And that's grandfather  Financed the movie  So  You know  That's all I need to say  Yeah  Says enough right there  So you were hired  For a sweet 16 party  James Dean's mantle  Is well protected  God damn  Michael Madsen

[05:45:00]  I gave her my heart and she gave me a cold  So now I sit standing here out in the pouring rain  I'll stumble back to Kelly's pub and cry away me pain  I'll drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it, fight  And I might see a freak, I'll sleep with that at night  Drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it, fight  It's a madhouse 
[05:45:30]  We gotta calm down, man, I gotta tell you right now  If you're just tuning in, I walked into work today with white crap all over my face 
[05:46:00]  I thought I was putting lotion on from the skin doctor  But it had to be something my girlfriend uses that is supposed to stay white on your face  And then Ant noticed that my hair is greasy  And we never noticed each other's appearances  We've been working together for 12 years  He could come in naked, I wouldn't notice  That doesn't matter  Oh, you'd notice, my friend  Ooh, you would notice  And even Ant's like, wow, your hair is a little greasy  Because I  Well, not until you pointed it out  All right, yeah, yeah  Where you grabbed it  And then lifted up with your hand  And your hair stayed there 
[05:46:30]  You look holy  He's got a halo  I don't know what I washed my hair with either  I gotta go home now and look at these bottles  But I was telling these guys  My chick has so much stuff in the shower area  First of all, it's dangerous  It's downright dangerous  Because like I said, I shower like 4.40 in the morning  The bottles are falling on my toes the whole time I'm in the shower  Everything's precariously perched on a soap dish  It's like five bottles are doing a balancing act 
[05:47:00]  When you're a bachelor, you got shampoo and conditioner in the same freaking bottle  Yeah, so you got one bottle and a bar of soap  That's all you need  That's it  You don't have the body washes and the conditioners and the  The glove with the washcloth on the palm  Yeah, what's that used for?  So you can wash with the glove  Yeah, I would run out of soap and I would just use shampoo over my whole bottle  Right, yeah  Smells good  Yeah, but now it's got  Glistening cubes  Wow, your chest hair is just glowing today 
[05:47:30]  It's nice and shiny  I got a feathered chest hair right over my nipples  Well, now I got stuff in the shower  That doesn't even say if it's shampoo or conditioner  They have weird names  Yeah  You got to speak the language of these bottles  You don't know what the hell it is  There's a wash for every part of the body  Yeah  Okay, here's the bottle for the face wash 
[05:48:00]  Here's our body wash  This is just for like the soles of our feet  Here's elbow wash  Here's the 20 things  Earlobe wax  And it's like, yeah, for every part of the body  And I'm just like, ah, bar of soap  Bar of soap and some shampoo  That's it  Well, they got to get the shower caddy  That's the first thing they do  Yeah  Somehow that only stays up for three days  And then that plastic hook just bends  Before it's dangling  Yeah  The whole, like, 50-pound thing falls on your foot  I'm just hoping I didn't, like, use something that removes hair or something 
[05:48:30]  Yeah, yeah  Nair  I'm trying to hold on to what I got, man  Eyebrows are going to be falling out  And your hair will fall out of your head  And then during the break, I'm like, what's this on my neck?  Like, I bit or something yesterday  And it was bothering me yesterday  And I itched this thing on my neck  And like a blister pops  I got blister juice all over my fingers  Ah!  Beyond disgusting  Jesus  I don't know what the hell's happening to me today  What the hell are you doing?  I'm having a really tough morning 
[05:49:00]  But anyway, Bill Burr, you have to tell the story  Oh yeah, my girl got this mint body wash  You know, it has like the sand mixed in with the lotion  I don't know what it was  Yeah, when did they decide that sand needs to be in these products, by the way?  Yeah, I don't know what it is  So I don't know  I've just, you know, grabbed for a bottle of it  And I put some in my hand  I'm like, ah, you know, it smells like mint  And I'm like, you know, I like mint chocolate chip ice cream  What the hell, I'll use it  So I start putting this stuff on, right?  Chest, arms, and all that stuff 
[05:49:30]  And then I start rinsing it off  And all of a sudden, it hit my area  Good junk  Yeah, and it felt like I had put toothpaste on it  And it was that horrific moment  Where I was just kind of holding on to the sides of the walls  Like, okay, how bad is this going to get?  Am I going to be screaming in pain?  It's like, this hurts really bad  And I know it hasn't reached its peak yet  Yeah  Would this, does mint bother a vagina?  Let's start with that  I guess not  I guess it's internal  Or they know where to put it 
[05:50:00]  So it doesn't maybe go there  There's a separate watch for that  Or it's probably only supposed to go on your elbows  On your elbows  Your armpits  Yeah  I would imagine it goes below the junk area  So when, you know  Yeah  You know, I bet if I read the back of the bottle  It says that  I bet you it's just for their thighs  This is what they need for just their thighs  Just thighs  I know, because some chick on some island of mint  They noticed that they had beautiful thighs there, so  Island of mint  The virus is out  Tell your friends  He's infected 
[05:50:30]  That's right, Opie  Shut your mouth  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event  The virus made my genitals rot off  Whoa, dude, don't come near me  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection  And it was better than my first kiss  Laugh until your energy spill out on the chair  Anthony Show  Opie and Anthony  Unmasked  Truth  In comedy  In the tradition of artists confidential and offstage  XM presents a new original series

[05:59:30]  I'm Ernie Spranz  When you first  Plug in your new HD TV  Everything won't  Magically turn  Into high definition  You have to make sure  You have everything  Required to watch HD  A surprising number  Of HD TV owners  About half  By some estimates  Are not getting  HD programming  Because they're  Missing something  To get high def content  From a cable  Satellite  Or phone company  You need  High def service  Digital programming  Can be standard  Or high definition  You must specify  That you want  High def 
[06:00:00]  Your receiver  Or set top box  Must also be  High def capable  Next you'll need  Component video  Or HDMI cables  To connect the receiver  To the TV  Other cables  Such as  S-Video  Can't carry  High def  Finally  You must be tuned  To an HD channel  The high def version  Of a channel  Has a different number  From its usual  Standard definition  Counterpart  And usually  Has the letters  HD  In the on-screen  Program guide  Listing it  When you turn on  Your new TV  Don't panic  If it doesn't look  As stunning
