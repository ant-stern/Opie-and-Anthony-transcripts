<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts expressing anxieties about potential layoffs and budget cuts at their workplace, likening their situation to a failing sitcom.  This segued into a discussion of listener-submitted drunk driving stories, featuring humorous anecdotes about intoxicated individuals' interactions with law enforcement, including one man repeatedly yelling "f***ing Boston" and another demanding arrest.  A video of an extremely inebriated man wreaking havoc in a police station was also discussed.

Bill Burr, guest-hosting for Jim Norton, joined the show, discussing Netflix streaming on his Xbox 360, the decline of physical media, and a memorable childhood road trip involving a leaky cooler and eight-tracks.  The conversation touched upon country music, with Burr criticizing modern artists.  The show included a "Guess the Sound" segment hinting at a disturbing audio clip, and a brief discussion of O.J. Simpson's impending sentencing.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the controversy surrounding Barack Obama's birth certificate, with the hosts and guests engaging in a heated debate about its legitimacy and the perceived double standards in media coverage of various political figures, including George W. Bush and Al Franken. This discussion was punctuated by profanity and crude jokes.  Another "Guess the Sound" segment featured a graphic video of self-mutilation, provoking strong reactions from the hosts and guests, Joe DeRosa and Bill Burr.  A recurring segment, "Name That Actor," featured Rich Voss's comically inaccurate celebrity identification attempts.  The show concluded the segment by revealing the identity of the man in the disturbing "Guess the Sound" video.

A bizarre video showing a man using a jar in a sexual act which then shattered inside him became a central topic. The hosts and Danny, a show staffer, described the video with crude analogies, prompting confused and amused reactions from callers. The authenticity of the video was debated, focusing on the lack of a scream.  This discussion flowed into detailed and graphic accounts of vomiting experiences,  a story about a man requesting a Confederate flag phone faceplate, a recollection of a puke-filled clam chowder eating contest, past experiences with alcohol abuse, and a possible future eggnog contest.  The segment also included promotions for upcoming comedy shows featuring Burr and DeRosa.

The show shifted to a discussion about the live performances of various rock bands, focusing on AC/DC and Brian Johnson's declining vocal abilities compared to other aging rockers. Callers, including Keith from San Francisco and Gary, shared their concert experiences.  The hosts compared the live performances of numerous bands (Rush, Blue Oyster Cult, U2, Metallica, Deep Purple, Poison, Winger, Kiss, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, Fleetwood Mac, Journey, and Boston) to their studio recordings, discussing the use of auto-tune and the overall decline in vocal quality among aging musicians.  Audio clips of a Journey cover band were played.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about bald, deceased musicians, a failed attempt to identify Kevin Dubrow of Quiet Riot, and a negative Ozzfest experience.  The hosts then expressed anger and frustration over rumors of their impending firing and show replacement at CBS Radio, using highly offensive language. A caller from Massachusetts reported that other DJs shared their concerns.  The discussion moved to false rumors spread by bloggers, criticisms of modern journalism, Larry King's interviewing style, and a humorous skateboarder interview anecdote. A planned parenthood gift certificate story was introduced with crude and offensive jokes.  A Gamefly live read preceded a segment with Burr and DeRosa, who recounted a disastrous "Uninformed" show recording experience marked by arguments, a fight at an airport, and Joe DeRosa's use of the word "cunt" on stage.  The segment concluded with AC/DC's "Thunderstruck."

The show concluded with Joe DeRosa detailing a "meltdown" during a recent stand-up performance, describing antagonistic behavior with a booing audience and comparing it to a previous hostile experience in Philadelphia.  The discussion, replete with vulgar language including frequent use of the word "cunt," analyzed what went wrong, addressing DeRosa's perceived "cavalier attitude" and the impact on other comedians. O&A also briefly discussed O.J. Simpson's recent jail sentence.

[00:09:30]  basically the lawyer had gotten drunk at a barbecue fell down some stairs and knocked his teeth out  that's how he met my dad so i'm sitting there scared to death not knowing what's going to go on  and i say to my tax attorney for my drunk driving case i go i'm not going to take the stand am i he  goes no no no don't worry i'll handle this and i go right off the bat mr burry take the stand please  and then immediately my stupid attorney starts acting like he's shuffling papers and stuff  oh no and i just remember being up on the stand and i'm and i'm just sitting there going uh 
[00:10:00]  the guy's going going so you agree under the penal code 76950 and i was literally going look  all i'm saying is that i was drinking and driving and the guy goes so you agree under the penal code  and i'm looking over at my lawyer he's pretending to write is he supposed to be helping you dude he  was such a tool like he literally was we were walking we were walking into the courthouse like as we  were walking and he was reading my police report which was hilarious but tragedy plus time the time  hadn't happened yet he's like hey like you remember saying this like i swear to god laughing 
[00:10:30]  at the police report and i'm like dude you know this really isn't that funny to me right now it  will be in a couple decades but i really wish i kept the police report it was so embarrassing what  did you say to the cop do you remember oh this was my opening line the guy goes uh hey first of all  you've been chasing me for like three miles i had no idea and he goes uh he goes so where you uh where  are you coming from and i go i go me uh effing boston oh you just dropped the f bomb well you 
[00:11:00]  know you you're cursed to give yourself time to collect your thoughts that's what i was doing  and he literally go he goes effing boston huh you want to get out of the car and i was like yeah  whatever you know dude i was so psyched that i didn't have to think anymore that i didn't have  that's how drunk i was that i didn't have to keep driving i was like relieved when i got pulled over  so so now according to him i don't remember this part because i just remember being in the car and  then being standing behind it but according to him i got out of my car and i had a beer between my legs 
[00:11:30]  that fell into the road oh that's a bad sign too yeah oh yeah i didn't need a lawyer dude it was just  open and shut and i just remember next thing i remember was i was standing in the back of my truck  and they were doing that stand on one leg put your finger why do they bother to do that at that point  you're just so gone anyway it's because some people still get out of it in that situation i have no  idea but literally i was fine right until i brought my finger up to about 12 o'clock and then all  the way down to six it felt like somebody else's hand i literally just like just whacked myself 
[00:12:00]  so then he just did some sort of bs thing all right you want to turn around stick your arms out  and it was just a great way to get me off balance so he could cuff me yeah yeah and then i said all  this dumb stuff in the car like i'm not mad at you you're just doing your job i understand you're  the understanding guy oh no yeah it was brutal you were the opposite of the oh fine man no get  off of me get off of me no i started off i was a little bad i'm like what about my truck  what about my truck screaming i'd be like you're lucky it's in one piece and you're alive dummy no i 
[00:12:30]  was a complete oh just a complete moron then then basically it wasn't until i got to the the the  whatever the barracks there the police headquarter they call it the hall of justice there that i realized  what was going on so we went to go take the breathalyzer my only strategy was when i went  to blow into it i wouldn't blow into it i would just puff out my cheeks they're like come on blow  into it i just i just see that one all the time come on blow into it they haven't seen that one

[00:18:30]  or drugs in a car the presumption is that everybody in the car owns it but i don't think that falls  into the same category help the drugs out there yeah i mean talk to drug drivers out there look  up that one hey we found a loophole for everybody that wants to drive around a bunch of your friends  and jump in the back seat jump in the back with everybody yeah there was recently i was 17 and uh  your story funneling liquor so you know what i mean we didn't really know too much all right thank  you john recently i uh there was a story about uh two people that got uh dwee in the same car at the 
[00:19:00]  same time because uh one was drunk and driving and then uh they saw that there was a cop behind  him and obviously switched positions and the other one was driving for a little while also  so uh the cop pulled him over and knew they were both driving had him on video they were both driving  two for one two for one driver and passenger on drunk driving all right we should take our first  break we got the phones oh wait this is the the video oh look at his ass cracks hanging out

[00:23:00]  human nature i think but uh unfortunately one thing about this also not just movies they have like  the box sets for tv series online there that you can just start watching instantly like adam 12 season  five i see that and i'm like who's who's watching that but like you bring up a good point sometimes you  just want to watch some crappy thing quincy they have every season of quincy on there so if you just  want to sit down and instantly sit and watch a dumb episode of quincy there it is all the columbos are on 
[00:23:30]  there i mean it's amazing that the movies they haven't quite yet gotten to the point where you're  like oh this one was just you know on dvd right and i could watch that instantly you still got to  send for it uh but as far as tv shows go and some of the older movies like i decided i want to i haven't  seen misery in a while so i'll watch that it's a fun movie so i popped that off a lot of laughs  when he gets hot chuckles she takes a sledgehammer to his ankle it is a great that's a great movie 
[00:24:00]  oh how how like sarcastic and condescending he is to her he realizes that's the only way he might  stay alive right but i love you annie no you don't shut up don't talk to her she's crazy  no but you know i don't understand like people who go out and buy when you talk about like watching  an episode like you go into like you know whatever record stores are left yeah you walk into virgin  or something i guess they're still around but they they literally they'll have like you know every 
[00:24:30]  episode of like soap and it's like who buys that well that's the last that's what's left heading the  the box oh there you go that's what that's all about but even the last thing left because they're not  put it out because they're not uh making new product but but here's a show like say like the  uh the wire people to everybody i know who watches that show say that's the greatest tv show ever and  there's five seasons out and i was i immediately thought like uh you know i'm gonna go to block  but i'll rent it but people would just go out and be yeah you know i i bought i bought the wire 
[00:25:00]  i got all 12 seasons of it yeah are you starting your own networks what are you gonna do after you  watch it it's over that's pretty much what you do now though you just buy it because it's kind of  between with me especially between late fees movies used to cost me like 50 bucks to to go to  blockbuster you know i haven't been there in years i don't even know if there's a blockbuster anywhere  anywhere they used to be everywhere that was a thing where you went and went wow there's a 
[00:25:30]  blockbuster on every corner yeah you know and and then it just they were gone because no one went and  rented movies anymore but uh like i said they they buy them but and then during christmas you get  some of the worst crap i actually somebody gave me i can't remember who who gave this to me  it was the box set of every episode of planet of the apes the tv series dude the tv series i can

[00:29:00]  a hand cranked phonograph hello my baby hello my honey hello my ragtime girl five foot two eyes are blue  mammy mommy how i love you how i love you no i was at the tail end of uh of um eight tracks like my dad  bought the eight tracks when we made our first trek across the country in a ford pinto uh was which  was a fabulous trip me my brother in the back in the hatchback of the pinto with a leaky cooler 
[00:29:30]  and my father drinking beer nice his uh girlfriend in the front seat all the way 3 000 miles across  the united the girlfriend take care of dad when you guys uh i don't know what happened when we dozed  off in freezing cold water i woke up shivering in in this ford pinto i was hoping for a rear ender just  to get warm those goddamn things uh but he had an eight track miserable childhood my we finally 
[00:30:00]  stopped uh because i guess my father was either too drunk or tired or both to drive any any further  and he decided it wasn't even going to be a straight through drive because these two kids in  the back might be in getting tortured in this back if you remember there wasn't it wasn't you could  fold the seats down in a ford pinto hatchback and we were laying down you we couldn't sit up or our  heads would hit the the hatchback and we were you know it was pretty small at the time and the cooler 
[00:30:30]  would uh condense and just drip all over the place so the whole carpet in the back was wet so we're  laying in a wet pinto carpet uh freezing because he decided we were going to take the northern route  so we could see things like mount rushmore and the badlands in south dakota and all that scenic  stuff instead of just bolting straight through timeout yes what was he avoiding in the south  your dad wasn't a oh believe me a scenery guy he had warrants out he must have various states he must 
[00:31:00]  have for god that's how he spun it that he wanted to show you the northern sites went to california  pretty much con territory there's something going on south of uh whatever no because at one point  coming back we did take the southern route to see the grand canyon and the great meteor crater and  you know all that kind of stuff but uh taking the northern route it was so goddamn cold and we're wet  in the back of a pinto that was that was why were you wet i don't get the wet part the cooler in the  back for the beer yeah uh it would condense on the outside of the cooler because coolers i guess back 
[00:31:30]  then sucked i don't know uh so it would drip all over the carpeting and the carpeting would absorb it  and it would wick out okay to the entire carpet so now we're laying on a wet carpet in the cold  just shivering and he's handing back like a cheese sandwich that that uh his his girlfriend was making  in the passenger seat like uh because she had like this little bag and did you tell him it was getting  wet back there were you too afraid to say no no i was like yeah it's wet back there don't worry about 
[00:32:00]  it i'll turn the heat up and the heat didn't work in a pinto it's a four-cylinder it's freezing out  we're in the northern territories i don't know we're with the tundra i you're praying you get  rear-ended and catch on fire did you listen to what i said i heard yeah i heard that's exactly  the joke i said did you already say that yeah listen to the replay we we do it all the time by  the way so i don't even feel bad me i me and jimmy constantly do it to each other and then we go  listen to the replay and when you listen to it you go oh my god that's where he said that joke 
[00:32:30]  you'll get sorry man you were painting this picture and i was this picture you know what  you said you said badlands and i thought about acdc had a song called badlands flick of the switch  and i was like wow i wanted did they do a show in the dakotas you were off well where the badlands  and then i said oh pinto i got a good one let me do the old gas station thing you went off the highway  for a while you were somewhere else i was it's all good so we stopped we stopped in um saint saint 
[00:33:00]  charles they had you a cheese sandwich yeah a cheese sandwich right i'm just not saying  everything i can remember for the last time a stupid cheese it wasn't velveta no i know it was  at least good cheese cheese wait did your dad have like warrants or something why was he going up to  the north oh by the way funny story it was warrants all over the southern united states for some reason  get it gonna ride the joke right now the ground get it and now you got like you know gps and stuff 
[00:33:30]  like that he had something that he got from uh uh triple a it was called a triptych and it was this  this thing that was like almost like a small loose leaf binder that you'd flip through and it had the  route that you were supposed to take and and each time you reached from the top of the page to the  bottom or the bottom of the page right turn the page and there was the rest of your route  and you had to keep you know turning the pages like that that was your navigation system your  rand mcnally navigation system and uh we ended up in saint charles uh minnesota or somewhere and he 
[00:34:00]  finally decided we were going to get a hotel and it was uh it was one of the worst i see it still  stands out in my head but he drove there from straight to saint charles from here yeah yeah that was  our first stop wow well his girlfriend drove also good lord his girlfriend drove but he drove the  whole way hours straight with a beer and uh his 38 like uh tucked tucked on the side of his seat 
[00:34:30]  just in case just in case you know he was got a lippy in the car just in case kind of guy  yeah that's where i got it sounds like vanishing point your dad kowalski yeah kowalski i wish it  was that car and uh yeah we it was one of the worst like wood paneling old like cold and just horrible  i was i just remember freezing the entire trip freezing cold i was miserable are you getting 
[00:35:00]  to eight tracks by the way oh right it was eight tracks uh any and uh before we left yeah he was like  let's uh get some eight tracks and he was into country music like old style country so old style  not not so no i mean old old new country i would definitely go with yeah old old that old old  stuff not so bad this new crap i'm not talking old cool country like willie or the outlaws there  like charlie daniels i'm talking like um charlie pride freddie fender freddie fender was wasted  days and wasted nights 
[00:35:30]  that stuff isn't that bad stuff like that it's worth a listen every once in a while the steel guitar  you know all that stuff i don't that's fine i don't mind that so i hear that and just instantly  become cold again that music makes sense when you're out in the middle of nowhere in the city 
[00:36:00]  like this stuff is horrible yeah get in the middle of nowhere by yourself i remember laying down and  and because of the way the hatchback on the pinto was it was a lot of glass like we used to lay down  and just look straight up at the stars uh because you know it's there was no light whatsoever so it's  very bright but i was freezing and and i i hear that you know and i swear i get this visceral  feeling when i hear those songs that brings me right back to when i was like i think i was 12 or 
[00:36:30]  something at the time and it was just were you dreaming of your future daddy someday i'm gonna  have a radio show i had no future at that point it was what it was whatever that moment was that was  my moment but when we bought the eight tracks um he he gave us uh one choice he's like well get an  eight track that you guys want to listen to and uh of course my brother wins out because he was older  and would have punched me uh so he got like an alice cooper uh uh eight track yuck and it lasted 
[00:37:00]  it lasted in the eight track player for exactly one minute good before pops took it out and smashed it  and and then took his two fingers dug in went with the tape did he really threw it out the window  and then  right back to it yeah this is it this this is it yes the hum of the pinto tires the stars the freezing  cold wet yeah but this music is cool when you're in the middle of nowhere yeah it was scary but new 
[00:37:30]  new country's horrible they try to cross over with new country it's all new country is like  we're trying to fit into some pop category also because it's all like uh you know hard guitars  and stuff or a lot of those dumb ballads that old chicks from fucking or i shouldn't say  see how natural the conversation gets drop an f-bomb all the girls from american idol  decide to uh put out well that's the last ditch effort for a lot of these broads when they 
[00:38:00]  they fail in their genre they go country yeah what's her name jessica simpson i think is trying  that right oh they show their clam and like rolling stone their clam or go country who doesn't  love johnny cash though come on yeah there was a little johnny cash going on there or anything  that sounds like johnny cash yeah is all right with me you don't like johnny cash billy i was able  wow get into i've been everywhere man i've been in rhode island maine i don't care don't turn me  i don't care where you've been i get it you chose the life yeah what do you think you're going to

[00:42:00]  Okay.  No, I'll call myself.  877-212-ON-A.  Bill was talking about bad country songs.  Yeah, and there was a song I heard.  I was just doing this gig in North Adams, Massachusetts,  and I was driving back, and this country song came on.  And it was so bad, I was screaming at my radio.  And I didn't hear what the DJ said, the name of it,  but maybe there's some country listeners out there.  It had something to do.  The guy, the basic story is the country singer sees this family that's poor, 
[00:42:30]  and he sticks a bag of groceries at their door.  And one of the kids sees him, I saw you, you left the groceries at my door.  If you could come back tomorrow, we could use a little more.  And it all rhymes.  And in the end, the kid's saying to the guy singing the song,  Are you an angel?  It's so bad.  And what I love about it is the whole song is the guy hyping himself up about what a great guy.  You know, I tried to drop him off, the groceries off, without anybody seeing me, 
[00:43:00]  but this hypothetical kid saw me, and I guess he thinks I'm an angel.  He's totally pumping himself up.  I was screaming at the radio, what an ass this guy is.  So when the DJ came on, I missed the name of the song,  but I don't know if you guys, you know, one of your trucker XM listeners.  I think Danny found it already.  To bring a little more.  Dad's a drunk, mom's a whore.  Yeah.  We can make our own lyrics for this one.  Who sings this, Danny?  Do we know yet?  I'm not sure if this is it.  I'm previewing it, actually, right now.  I'm not quite sure if this is the one that he's talking about. 
[00:43:30]  It is a country song called I Need Some Groceries.  Oh, well, yeah, they're real subtle with the title.  Right.  I'm sure that's it.  What other, how many grocery songs?  Country music really is music for broke white people.  Yeah, totally.  All right, someone out there will have the title.  Yeah, well, we got to try to find something I'm really talking about.  Dude, I was doing this gig in Indianapolis, and the following week I was in Nashville,  so rather than fly all the way back to L.A., I just drove down to Nashville,  and I have some friends down there, and I drove through Kentucky, 
[00:44:00]  and the last exit before I got into Tennessee, I stopped to get gas, dude.  I saw some of the poorest white people.  First of all, everybody looked like a miner.  They all had, like, these beards and stuff, and the prices, you know,  it's what the market will bear.  Everything was, like, I remember paying for gas like this when I was in, like, high school.  It was before.  Give me a dollar.  No, it was literally, it was, like, a buck 69,  but this was back when the rest of us were paying, like, probably, like, 225.  That's a huge drop. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  And I went to, like, the Burger King that they had right there.  It was a really horrible moment in my life.  And, like, one of, like, the benches at the Burger King was, like, broken,  and you could tell it had been broken for, like, a long time.  It's a Burger King.  It's a Burger King.  They got money.  You got the franchise.  And even, like, their dollar meals, I think, were, like, 89 cents.  It was even, everything.  Everything was a little cheaper.  Oh, yeah, and I got out of the car, and I was, like, literally, I felt, like, uncomfortable, like, nervous.  Even though everybody was white, they could tell that I was, like, an outsider. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, they want to pick something off you.  They want to get something from you.  Speaking of gas, oil drops to $44 a barrel.  Yeah.  They're starting to talk about gas hitting $1 a gallon.  $1 a gallon.  Which is not good, by the way.  Anthony was explaining this.  It's not good when you start paying $1 a gallon for gas.  Well, did I say that?  In the overall scheme of things.  Who was saying that?  Someone came up with a great point about this.  Well, let me ask you.  I love $1 a gallon.  Well, we all love it, but.  Why was it $4.80?  Exactly.  And now, all of a sudden. 
[00:45:30]  Don't try to figure it out, Bill, please.  And they panicked us.  They panicked us.  I remember the news saying we could be looking at $10 a gallon by this time next year.  And everyone was freaking out.  They're hooking pedals up to their cars, pedal and chain, so they could pedal their cars in to work.  You know what I think it was?  I think it was a big test, and we failed.  Like, nobody protested.  Nobody went nuts. 
[00:46:00]  They were just like, let's see how far we can push this.  Hey, you want to go up to $4.80?  Dude, I'll do it.  I'll hit the button.  It's just 10 guys in a room, and they hit the button, and then they dive under the conference table just waiting for people to freak out.  And when they don't, they're like, hey, we'll buy another yacht.  High fives for everybody.  Yeah.  So now everything drops.  All of the prices, the price of oil drops.  We're paying, yeah, really cheap now compared to just, and it's not even like it was this time last year.  We were paying almost $5 a gallon for gasoline. 
[00:46:30]  It was this time last month.  It was no time ago.  You know what?  The big three are going down.  They call up the oil companies and say, look, dude, we have 9 million SUVs.  We've got to get rid of these things.  Can't sell them.  Exactly.  Just bring it down.  Just knock it down.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  I'll buy you a yacht.  Somehow we'll kick back some of the money.  Yeah, we'll kick you some over.  And that, because, yeah, it killed the audio industry because they were still all geared up for the SUVs that they were pumping out.  And everyone started going, no, we want little cars. 
[00:47:00]  We want hybrids, this, that, the other.  Have you seen those things in used cars lots, dude?  There's like 40 of them.  You get an excursion for about 250 bucks.  Take two.  Get them out of here.  Everyone offed their SUVs.  You drive down the road, and it used to be you'd just see SUVs everywhere on the expressway.  Every other car you passed was an SUV.  And now it's all smaller cars, and everyone's trying to be economical. 
[00:47:30]  I hated the SUVs of the world because I've always driven cars.  I love the SUVs.  I need to know why we're not moving.  If I can just see five cars in front of me, I'm fine.  Yeah, that is a bitch.  But what sucks is even when you buy an SUV, you can't see around another SUV.  Yeah, that's why I've got to get around them and pass them.  Yesterday, I did a little acrobatic driving, which is necessary.  There is a turn that is impossible for a tractor trailer to make.  It is in Queens, around Queens Plaza, just on the service road of the expressway. 
[00:48:00]  You have to drive a little further to get on the expressway.  I hit this thing all the time, and I just see traffic, and this looks like a jackknife tractor trailer  because he's got the wheel cut so far.  He still can't get in there.  Someone else is out trying to back him up.  And traffic is backed up so far, and I instantly jam on my brakes, and I start looking around.  And I look, and I go, there it is, an opening.  There's an opening by the parking, parallel parking. 
[00:48:30]  And there's a nice, wide sidewalk there.  So I, electric mirrors, I pull them in.  I go right up on the sidewalk, and I drive about a quarter mile.  It's like Lee Majors in the fall guy.  I drive about a quarter mile down the sidewalk, and now at this point I've had my Escalade for a while,  so it's been dinged and nicked enough times where if I scrape the fence a little with my mirror,  it doesn't really bother me.  A little chain link fence in between that and the traffic light control box and stuff. 
[00:49:00]  And I'm just driving down the sidewalk until I pass this mess, and then I see another open little parking space,  and I go down over the curb, and I'm freaking clear.  And I look behind me and go, ha-ha, ha-ha, I did it.  And then I see someone else trying it, you know, like I inspired somebody.  But without an SUV, without an SUV, you're screwed.  You're just sitting there.  Oh, yeah, you can never drive on a sidewalk with a car.  No, you'll take your goddamn oil pan out.  It really can never make that little four-inch.  Dude, you can do that.  There are some big curbs there. 
[00:49:30]  That's service road curbs.  You need the SUV to pop over the curb is what he's saying.  You need that.  And, you know, you want a sticker on the sidewalk.  My hybrid would have a dual front tire flats.  Yeah, they'd have a heart attack.  The aluminum foil frigging oil pan would rip.  Dude, you know what?  I actually was reading the owner's manual, and I realized, like, there's a certain way that if you tow,  the car, you're overcharging the battery or something?  Yeah, the wheel spinning charges the battery when you're off the gas or something. 
[00:50:00]  But there's conflicting drawings.  One says you're supposed to lift it up from the rear end.  The other one says the front end.  You can't just, like, old school, like your friends, tie a rope to the bumper and a bumper to the other car  and just say, hey, told me.  Tie a rope to it?  What are you, footloose?  I remember.  We all did that.  It's like, dude, I just bought a car, but, you know, it's not registered and insured.  Were you ever the guy in the towed car because you had to, like, you know, ride the brake and, like, oh, my God.  You got to ride that brake because you don't want to slack that rope. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't slack it up.  But then you don't want to ride the brake too hard because then the rope breaks or your bumper falls off.  That is the scariest position to be in.  You know what?  But someone had to do it.  Pay attention.  Right.  You know what's a great one, too, is when somebody just tries to push your car with the bumper,  and then there's that classic thing where you have to keep yourself, like, up against them.  And then when you don't, then you try to catch up and you're basically rear-ending them.  Then you're ramming them.  Yeah, you're messing up the front of your car.  It's destroying your friend's car.  It's almost, you see the brake lights come on.  You're like, what are you doing?  You roll your window down.  No brakes, ass. 
[00:51:00]  But, yeah, you tow your car home like that plenty of times.  You can't do that with a hybrid, though.  Yeah, the little, it's made to charge your battery for when you're not on the gas.  No, you can do it.  You just have to know how to do it.  You have to lift your rear wheels up?  How do you do that?  There's nothing like that.  I know, I know.  You're going to be on the whole thing.  Oh, these cars are awful.  No, I'm not saying that.  You know something?  At a dollar a gallon, I think they'll actually pay me.  I don't even know what that is.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, what does that work out to?  I could drive cross-country on 82 cents. 
[00:51:30]  Dollar a gallon?  What was it, like an 11-gallon tank, maybe?  Is that what you got?  Yeah, something like that.  I was getting to the point where even I was just, I'd be pumping gas and look and go,  oh, my God.  You've got to be kidding.  It's hitting the $100 mark.  It's like, ching, ching.  It's hitting the $100 mark to fill my tank up.  I got up to 45 bucks on the hybrid.  On a hybrid.  On a hybrid.  Dude, that's insane.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, we got a guest to sound.  Danny's saying, we got to do this. 
[00:52:00]  We love guests to sound.  I don't want to say too much yet, but don't even say what you told me.  Let's start with just guest to sound.  People might be like, ah, no big deal.  They'll try to figure out what this is, and then it leads to an ugly place, I do believe,  if I read your email correctly this morning at 430.  I know what this is. 
[00:52:30]  For real?  That's somebody opening a jar of mayonnaise on a plane.  Now, from the sounds, it doesn't really sound that bad.  Right.  Right?  But you really got to just, like, the main sound, I think, that's there.  It's not so much the end.  It's at the very beginning.  It's very...  Look at the whores on the news, man.  It's just unreal.  Sorry.  Yeah.  You really got to be a hottie now to let people know there's a storm or something.  Yeah, weather or traffic or some other crap. 
[00:53:00]  Well, why would you want a man telling you where there's a traffic jam?  That's just preposterous.  Because they know how to drive.  Never, yeah.  They made her get, like, fake boobs or something to compete with your ex, I think.  Or gel?  Yeah, because that one used to be really flat.  Yeah.  But that's, I think that's, like, padded fake boobs.  I don't think she...  She had a baby, so there may be...  I don't think she committed to the actual implants, but you got to have the big boobies  to be on TV.  So that's, guess the sound.  Yeah, I mean, you really want... 
[00:53:30]  To me, it's like, who gives a crap?  Yeah, it almost sounds that way.  But when...  I can guarantee that when I pop the video up, I dare each and every one of you to sit  through it.  Really?  Yeah.  Dude, we're veterans of two girls, one cop.  So am I.  But Danny is the biggest veteran of all.  And he said that this is the first video you couldn't watch?  I started watching it, and I was like, oh, so what?  And then about 25 seconds in...  Really?  So what?  Is that all you got, video?  I was like, this is what's passing for internet videos these days?  Yeah, you really got to pour it on. 
[00:54:00]  And then something happens, and I went, no.  And I immediately turned it off.  Is the audio clip you just played from the so what portion up into the oh my god, or  this is all oh my god?  There was no audio of the kind of so what portion.  Okay, so this is all oh my god.  Yeah, the first initial sound that you hear pretty much starts the oh no, oh no, oh no  part of your brain.  Okay.  Why would you do that to me? 
[00:54:30]  Let me hear it again.  Yeah, this is it.  Guess the sound.  Try to figure this out.  It's going to lead to an ugly place today.  I'll tell you this much.  I know I'm supposed to be like the cool shock jock, but if this is like anything to do with  beheadings, that's my line.  No, no, no, no.  That's my line. 
[00:55:00]  I have not seen a beheading video, and I refuse to.  I think anything else is almost fair game.  Does it have anything to do with the food industry?  In a weird peripheral way.  The very beginnings of the food industry?  No.  No, it's not a cow being.  No.  Is it someone making their own hamburger?  Yeah.  No, it's not that.  No.  All right.  All right.  I hear that.  And it's not a beheading video.  It is not a beheading video.  All right.  I'm in, then.  I'm in.  I can play.  Yeah.  All right.  Try to figure out what that sound is, and we'll have the answer very soon. 
[00:55:30]  At least.  But we'll have the answer by next Thursday.  No problem.  I will not be.  I will not be watching.  So we got the gas dropping.  We got O.J. is going to find out his fate today.  What do you think?  Well, they're saying the minimum that he can even get is six years.  So he's guaranteed six years.  They're not saying that if he'll go to prison.  They're saying how long.  The minimum he can get is six years. 
[00:56:00]  The max is a life sentence.  They doubt that the judge is going to give him that.  But he did kill two people and get away with it.  So who the hell knows?  Objection.  Oh, objection.  He was acquitted.  Well, he was.  That had nothing to do with this.  We know he absolutely did it, and so does the jury, and so does the judge.  So I hope they actually do give him life in prison to make up for the fact that.  The one and only guy to gain 2,000 yards in a 14-game season.  You'll never see that again.  All right.  Almost impossible.  Okay. 
[00:56:30]  Six years.  On the Bills, no less.  Oh.  The Bills even good back then.  I don't even remember.  Prison will kill.  When he was running that.  The Dolphins were killing everybody in the AFC East.  Well, that's true.  You're right.  You think he'll go to real prison, or?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he'll go to real prison.  This is, he's in deep doo-doo.  They're pretty strict in Vegas, man.  How do you think he'll be received in prison?  A celebrity.  Yeah.  They'll love him.  They're suggesting 18 years.  He's old enough where, you know, you wouldn't get any rep for, you know, beating the crap out of him. 
[00:57:00]  But, like, uh...  No, no.  He's too old to beat up and go, I beat up OJ.  Then you would just be shanked.  I think he's going to be a hero in prison.  They love the fact that he got away with killing two white people.  How many years, though?  I would say if the prosecution is suggesting 18, then they'll half that, and they'll give him nine years.  Nine years?  I'm saying nine years.  Will he have to do the nine?  No, he's out in four and a half.  Or is it like, you know, in dog terms, like prison years is like dog terms. 
[00:57:30]  If they say nine, that means you're doing four and a half.  He's out in four and a half.  If he lives through it, and then he'll be on probation.  Hey, if he gets life, do you think he'll finally just come out and be like, all right, I did it.  Oh, God.  I did it.  And I'm happy, that bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, we got to pray for life.  Because then we get the real story.  We get all the details, everything.  Come on, man.  You think he'll spill it to his cellmate?  She almost had her head cut off.  That's such a crime of passion.  That's not an assassination.  That's not a robbery. 
[00:58:00]  It's not, you know.  Because knowing OJ, if he gets the life, he will give you all the details.  He's dying to give all the details officially in a sit-down interview.  Get it off your chest.  Yeah.  Forgiveness.  Goldman's going to get himself arrested and put in the same prison and play out the scene from Bad Boys.  I was going to say, like Shawshank, when the new kid comes in and he talks about his old cellmate.  Yeah, yeah.  Tasty little bitch, too.  This guy OJ, I roomed with him and he talked about walking in on his wife and some waiter. 
[00:58:30]  Gave me stuff, so I killed him.  Judge Jackie.  And the best part?  That guy couldn't have been happier that he killed them and got away with it in Shawshank.  The best part?  He took the fall more.  Those friggin' brown teeth.  Judge Jackie Glass is known for giving severe sentences and tongue lashings to high-profile defendants. 
[00:59:00]  And she has blasted Simpson before.  So I think he's not getting away this time.  I hate tough judges.  With a light sentence anyway.  She?  Is it a female judge?  Yeah.  He's done.  He's so screwed.  He's done.  I'm sick of tough judges.  Yeah.  Their stupid attitudes.  Like, they're tough.  They're robes.  I don't...  I'm not even sick of real judges.  I'm sick of movie judges because they're all fat, sassy black women now.  That's like, and you're...  Please rise as your honor. 
[00:59:30]  What's her name?  Comes in.  And she comes in.  And it's always some big, sassy black woman who sits down and, mm, let me tell you something, honey.  And you're like, how did you become a judge talking like that?  Just stop it.  Judge Judy annoys the hell out of me.  Oh, yeah.  That's Obama's...  Sorry.  That was Obama's what?  Real parents?  I'd never seen his parents before.  Sorry about that.  Problem?  I just totally threw you off the track.  No, was there a problem there with the real parents?  Now this is finally going to come out that he's not an American citizen? 
[01:00:00]  Well, that's what they're going for.  Oh, this has been going on for the entire time, man.  This guy won't show his goddamn birth certificate.  If it's good, if it's legit, show the goddamn thing.  He won't show it.  You know why?  A lot of people are suggesting he wasn't born in this country and is not qualified.  Then you don't fall into the qualifications to be president.  You'll be born in the country.  So he will...  If you have a birth certificate that says you were born in wherever, 
[01:00:30]  look at me, flushing New York, there you go, born in New York,  what am I going to do?  Go, you can't see that.  I'd be like, here, look, see, it says I was born in the USA.  Why wouldn't they...  Because it says Africa.  No, but no, what I'm saying, how come...  Once you run for that office, don't they just kind of have access to everything?  No, they've given this guy more latitude on everything.  He doesn't have to answer questions.  Well, wouldn't it be easy to prove?  He doesn't have to do anything.  He doesn't have to come up with ideas as to how he's going to do things. 
[01:01:00]  No one questions him on anything.  But the birth certificates, they can't get a copy of this and prove it?  No!  As opposed to what?  Where?  Where are they going to go?  I don't know.  I have a stunt brain.  Hold on.  I had to get my birth certificate recently, and it was...  Andy, not to get into a political rant, but Bush kind of got away with...  They all got away with stuff.  What, with his draft dodging?  I was in the National Guard.  What do we got on him?  He went AWOL a couple of times, but he flew planes.  What do we got on the Obama birth certificate thing?  He just had a hunch, so he went to war with another country. 
[01:01:30]  Whoops!  Oh, no, that's all.  Well, he's admitting that he was...  No, that's completely stupid.  Believe me.  I'm just saying.  They all get away with stuff.  Well, let's go to stunt brain.  But not be qualified to be president as far as...  What does stunt brain know on this?  There was a question on the birth certificate, and they turned in a copy of one, which apparently  doesn't show the legitimate stamp, you know, like the notary stamp.  If I go anywhere without the raised seal on a birth certificate, you can't get on a plane.  You can't do anything like that if you're using that without a passport.  You can't use your birth certificate without the raised seal to do anything. 
[01:02:00]  Nonetheless, become president of the United States.  And there's also a story that apparently one of his relatives is saying that he was, in  fact, born in a hospital in Africa.  So there are questions about whether it's there or not, but he has turned in a copy,  and he got a passport, which you can't get a passport unless you have a legitimate birth  certificate.  Oh, can't you?  Well, come on.  He didn't have a legitimate one to run for president.  I wonder.  I wonder.  But he got a passport through our system.  Show the goddamn thing. 
[01:02:30]  If you can't get on a plane without it, then how are you going to get a passport without  that raised seal?  He's Obama.  The suit was dismissed a couple of times, and until Alan Keyes brought the suit, it  wasn't allowed to proceed because the court said none of the people who brought the suits  had standing.  In other words, they couldn't have benefited by this being thrown out.  But Keyes was a candidate, so he was given standing.  If you were Obama, wouldn't you just say, look, show him the goddamn thing to stop any  of this speculation?  But does this story have any legs? 
[01:03:00]  Yes, absolutely.  Dude, this has been a story for the entire time he's been campaigning.  Is the Supreme Court going to...  He's refused...  They are treating this guy like the Messiah.  He can do whatever he wants.  No one questions anything this guy does.  Or anything.  Who's on the other side of this issue?  Anything forever, dude.  Look at that crap that went on down in Florida.  They just gave it to the guy.  Come on, man.  Oh, come on.  That went through the court.  See, you're one of those guys, man.  I can't stand people.  You're just going to attack one side, dude.  Obama's getting away with a ridiculous amount right now. 
[01:03:30]  Bush got away with a ridiculous amount.  They all get away with this stuff, man.  It's brutal.  It's brutal.  Okay, look what stupid Al Franken's doing with his votes up there.  Where is it?  Minnesota.  Yeah.  This guy, if a Republican was trying this, they would be like, he's trying to rig the  vote.  He's rigging the vote.  But it's Al Franken, Mr. Friggin, you can't get any further left liberal ass that he is.  So he's counting the votes, what are we on, eight times now that they're counting this? 
[01:04:00]  You're lost.  Go back to putting a satellite dish on your head and doing a wacky bit on SNL, you unfunny  hack.  You're not a fan of Al Franken, huh?  Oh, he sucks.  Sucks.  I hate the dude, actually, too.  Look, you're not getting it.  And I lean more toward that side, man.  Every moronic thing George Bush has done, and there's been chock full of him, his whole  two terms.  You'll not get an argument out of me.  He's a dummy.  He's a douche.  He's effed up.  He's lied to the country.  I was never in for a war to free those savages over in Iraq. 
[01:04:30]  But my point is, is people got to stop going Republican, Democrat, dude.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's wrestling.  It's not real.  It's BS, man.  They're just, they're just selected guys, man.  I like that.  But, but, but, but you know something?  Bush was openly criticized his entire administration.  And let me tell you, good.  He did a lot of bonehead moves.  This guy, you walk on eggshells around him because you'd be called a racist if you criticize 
[01:05:00]  him because he's such a young genius.  This is the beginning.  And everyone's scared, crapless of criticizing this guy.  Now, this is the beginning.  Now, this is the beginning.  So you always have the honeymoon phase.  Come on, man.  People didn't go at Bush.  And dude, right after 9-11, everybody was behind the guy.  You know, we wanted to get this country together.  And it wasn't until like basically once he started going into Iraq and everything got  crazy.  It was the first couple, and then he said the war is over.  Everyone was still with him at that point.  I was relieved.  Good.  The war is over and all that type of stuff.  And then when it continued, that's when people started jumping on him. 
[01:05:30]  Dude, his Coke thing.  This all came out pre-first election.  His service in the National Guard, his draft dodging.  But that all came up, and the press pounded him and pounded him.  And he had to come up with answers.  And the paperwork.  Remember CBS?  He never came up with any answers, dude.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He didn't.  They did this to Clinton.  They did this to all of them.  You're right.  He didn't.  But CBS came up with papers up the yim-yam about how he draft dodged and did this and 
[01:06:00]  didn't do this.  And they put it on the news.  And what happened?  Well, he served for two terms.  Right.  But let me tell you, the press went out of their way to find papers on this guy and how  he dodged the draft.  And he was gone on 1969.  On January 4th.  He was AWOL.  He was AWOL.  He's been handled with kid gloves.  And this guy, absolutely.  And they're not arguing over this birth certificate thing.  They're not questioning him on the fact that he's got so many socialist agendas. 
[01:06:30]  They're not.  You know what?  They ask him about it.  He gives this vague answer about hope and everything.  And then they leave him alone.  They leave him alone.  I'd love to see him dig into this guy.  What happened in the last eight years?  I mean, those guys got away with murder.  They got away with murder.  I'm not saying you're not going to get away with it.  I'm saying that whether it's questioned or not.  Bush was constantly being beat up and pounded.  Obama is being handled with kid gloves, without a doubt.  Of course.  Because I think because he's black and it's very...  I saw Jay Leno the other night. 
[01:07:00]  Like, he goes, you know, I don't know.  I mean, it's really hard.  Because the guy he sees so...  He's like, perfect.  He's like, see, just kiss his ass.  Yeah, it's like, no.  It's like...  You skunk-headed douche.  It's like, no.  Hey, we like Jay.  You're afraid to do jokes because it's a black dude and you don't know how to get into that.  Right.  That's a great point.  I'm saying, but my point is, though, is that they do this with every guy in there.  Like, they have this legitimate stuff they should be, you know, attacked for and they're not.  They're not. 
[01:07:30]  Bush was attacked on everything he did.  Everything.  By what?  I mean, what happened, though?  Nothing happened.  I'm not talking about the end.  Who cares?  If you get attacked and nothing happens, who cares?  They won't even attack him.  They've already proclaimed a holiday in Alabama.  A county in Alabama has already proclaimed...  I'm kind of a bill, though.  It's the honeymoon phase.  It's the honeymoon phase.  All right?  I kind of agree with that.  Everybody is so beaten down by this thing.  And now, as Bush is on his way out, dude, you wait, dude.  You wait when the...  We'll wait and see that. 
[01:08:00]  But Bush did not get a honeymoon.  Wait, wait, wait.  Until 9-11.  That didn't last long.  When the credit...  Well, I mean, dude, that election was a little wacky.  Dude, when the credit card bubble burst, dude, then this guy...  I feel bad for Obama.  That guy, he's been passed the biggest hot potato in the history of this country.  And there's not...  It's like, all right, dude, here you go.  Get us out of Iraq.  Do all this stuff, dude.  That guy is completely...  And let's see how they hammer him.  Oh, he's going to get destroyed.  I think Bill's right.  You've got to give him about a year, and then we'll see where we're at. 
[01:08:30]  Nope.  They're building the cross right now.  Right now, it's like, you can't do no wrong.  We'll see.  They're building...  Yeah.  Chris Matthews went on the air and said, it is my job to make sure he succeeds as president.  There you go.  The media has already said, we are going to make him successful.  Let's see what happens.  Matthews said it.  Let me ask you something.  With the birth certificate thing, who's pushing it on the other side, though?  You know what I want to bet?  I'll bet you a hundred bucks this time next year.  That guy is going to be sitting in a hailstorm, dealing with the fallout of all this stuff.  That birth certificate thing will come in, and they'll have those pictures in the paper.  Dude, they do this to everybody in the media. 
[01:09:00]  When you first come in, they fuck...  Oops.  Boo!  Mike, can I...  Three, two, one.  Three, two, one.  They do this with everybody in the media.  When you first come out, they build you up.  Everybody loves you.  Then you go through your John Travolta, look who's talking, those awful baby movies, and  they bring you crashing down to the earth.  And if you're lucky, you've got a Pulp Fiction, and you come back.  Or if you don't, then you...  I think Bill's right on.  No one escapes that crap. 
[01:09:30]  They will.  We'll have to wait and see.  I think, unfortunately...  This is all speculation, though.  You've got to wait a little bit.  And I definitely agree with you that he was handled with kid gloves, and it was on two  who didn't think.  One, because he was a black dude, and it's like, I don't want to seem like I'm racist.  And two, people were so sick of Bush and those guys.  Right, right.  That anybody...  And Chaney reminded them of more of that, a continuation of that.  So...  Chaney, I'm sorry.  What's his face?  McKinney.  Let me grab the ball back here, though.  So the birth certificate thing.  Yeah.  Who's pushing this on the other side where this might become a big thing? 
[01:10:00]  Or is this just going to fade away?  Right-wing fanatics.  But you need a good...  You need a good...  Well, Alan Keyes has got it up in front of the Supreme Court.  Half Alan Keyes.  And he's the only one they would give standing to because he's the only one who stood to  benefit.  I think you need someone to even...  But we'll know today, I guess, because the Supreme Court...  I think it just goes away and becomes just one of those things that...  Eh, we'll see.  ...didn't have legs.  One of those things.  It's so funny when you go politics.  Todd, South Carolina, Greasewood Ant, Rob in New York, Ant doesn't know what he's talking  about.  Bill is being an idiot. 
[01:10:30]  Bill is right on.  I mean, it's...  Yeah, yeah.  No, we were joking about that.  Like, we had that fight about whatever the hell we were yelling at yesterday.  We both got an equal amount of, Bill, yeah, it was really nice to hear you take Anthony  to task.  Yeah.  It's finally good to hear a balanced opinion.  Then the very next email.  Bill, you're an idiot.  Yeah.  I got the same thing.  There is no conspiracy.  You just sound like a moron.  Listen to Anthony, you know?  Anthony, you are an ass.  Bill finally put you in your place.  You do nothing but yell about things that you have no knowledge about.  Anthony, finally, a voice of reason on radio. 
[01:11:00]  I'm like, wait.  There's no middle ground.  There's no...  Well, you kind of both made some decent points.  I think we're the only radio show that will admit that, though.  I know.  It's hysterical.  No matter what you say, people are going to agree with you, and then you're going to  have a bunch of people that say, you're effing out of your mind.  Yeah, it really is funny.  But you don't get that on Rush Limbaugh or any of these other shows.  It's rah, rah, rah, one-sided.  Oh, see, I told you so.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, we got people riled up, so let's go to the FU line as we go to break here. 
[01:11:30]  It's Opie and Anthony, Bill Burr, Caroline's tonight.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.

Thank you, and goodbye.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  I've got to explain.  Joe DeRosa is joining the program, and Joe's been working the New York clubs forever.  Got here in 82.  Basically.  Young guy, but I've seen Joe at the New York comedy clubs for years, and I kind of feel  bad because Joe is really funny, and after every show, I'll go up to him like, man, we've got to get you on the show.  So, year after year after year goes by with me saying that, right? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, we'll get you on the show.  Are you one of those guys, though, who says that to everybody?  Not really.  Oh, okay.  Not really.  Sometimes people have shows, and they're like, hey there, kid, I'm going to make you a star.  Early on.  No, I'm in a weird...  People come up and go, hey, I got that show.  Yeah, I'd like to have you on.  And meanwhile, it's like, ugh.  No, but I'm in a weird position because I live in New York, so I'm in the comedy clubs a lot more than Anthony these days.  And some of these guys, I can see it in their eyes.  They know him in the audience, and they have that look of, ugh, maybe he'll try to get me on the show. 
[01:14:00]  And I'm like, hey, you're good.  And then I kind of like awkwardly walk off.  Hey, you're wearing a shirt.  Right.  So, here's what they say.  Who do I send, who do I call or email about getting on the show?  Oh, that's, yes, that's Steve, Steve C.  And then immediately you go, oh, excuse me, call Steve C.  Yeah, if this guy emails you or calls you, don't ever get back to him. 
[01:14:30]  But Joe was one of these guys, I was like, no, we really want to try to figure out how to get him on the show and work him in.  To make a long story short, we finally had Joe in about a month, two months ago, a month and a half ago, maybe.  Yeah.  F and killed, and I looked at him like, I'm the idiot here.  We should have had you on years ago, man.  Well, thanks for this.  But you finally broke in.  It's nice to be here.  To the old man and half of the community.  But I knew you were, honestly, when you said, no, no, no, no, no.  When you said that stuff to me at the club, you'd be like, you're funny.  I believe you were sincere because the second time I ever met you, I used to open with this joke about being skinny fat years ago. 
[01:15:00]  And you came up to me and you go, hey, skinny fat.  And I was like, oh, he remembered my joke, so he must have really listened.  Yeah, he listened to it.  Yeah, but now it comes to this point.  Bill Burr is at Caroline's for the whole weekend, tonight, Saturday, and Sunday.  And I just found out that DeRosa is doing the show with you, and that's a huge bill right there.  Yeah, we've been doing the uninformed tour that we did.  We've had some stops that were good and people actually knew about the show. 
[01:15:30]  And then other ones like Richmond, Virginia.  Like, I don't think they even knew who I was.  They were, like, giving away free tickets.  It's the worst comedy club ever.  Or, like, they'll have, like, you know, Richmond Funny Bone, you know, 127 Main Street.  So you think you're going to drive by it and see it?  It's at the back of a mall, like, next to a Dick's Sporting Good.  It's hilarious.  It's awful.  So we literally, at the end of the show, we would both go on stage and be like, hey, is who out there listens to the uninformed show?  And you just literally hear, like, one guy in the background, and then we have to explain. 
[01:16:00]  And he thinks you're talking about something else anyway.  We'd have to explain what the show was, and then they were just confused.  Like, why are they both up there on stage?  Because in the end, we sort of just give each other.  Well, people are confused as they listen to this.  It should be, you know, stated that you guys do a radio show together.  They do a radio show.  Sirius XM every once in a while.  It's called Uninformed.  And it's a really good radio show.  The premise is fantastic because it's a lot like what we do when Bill comes on. 
[01:16:30]  We have these discussions with such passion as if we've actually read about what we're talking about.  Oh, yeah.  And we're completely, and you guys took the name of the show.  That's what it is, uninformed about the subject.  But if you have a radio show and you're in front of a microphone, you can make it sound like you are so informed.  Uninformed just by being so passionate about what you're talking about.  That's every argument we've ever had.  Bill and I, when he still lived in New York, we got into an argument so bad one day about politics. 
[01:17:00]  And I was arguing for the right and he was arguing for the left.  And neither of us knew what we were talking about at all.  But the argument got to a point where we were like a married couple.  He started washing dishes in the middle of the argument.  And he was screaming over his shoulder going, you're an idiot, you moron.  And neither of us knew what we were talking about at all.  Well, we can't even name the senator of this state.  I know Schwarzenegger's governor of California because he's famous.  When we got fired and we had some downtime, stupid Michael Moore got me into the political thing. 
[01:17:30]  And I saw, you know, Bowling for Columbine.  So then I'm thinking, you know, I think I could talk politics.  And then I would go to the bookstore and get some of those books everyone was writing, Sean Hannity.  And then you got the Michael Moore and then maybe the Al Franken book.  And I started reading all those things thinking, yeah, now I know everything about politics.  I could argue these points.  And you realize these guys are in the same boat.  Right.  They just, you know, grab a sound bite here and there.  Oh, yeah.  Half my opinions are stuff I overheard on the subway. 
[01:18:00]  Somebody yelled it in a bar.  You kind of thought it sounded good.  Yeah, it just goes through my brain if it sticks and then it just comes out.  Right after you say it, you catch the person looking at you like, please don't ask a follow-up question.  Please, please don't ask me to back that up.  Because I will unravel right in front of you.  Somebody called me on that the other day.  I was arguing with one of my buddies about Bush Sr.  And I was like, you know, Bush Sr. actually did a lot of great stuff.  He ended the Cold War.  Like what?  Yeah, and he goes, you just heard that somewhere and you're just repeating it. 
[01:18:30]  And I was like, you shut up.  No, I didn't.  You never want to hear, what do you mean by that?  Yeah.  Yeah, my brother got somebody the other day.  The guy's hit that whole, like, that rumor of why gas is coming down is because, you know, people really cut back.  People really cut back when it was 480.  And he goes, oh, yeah.  He goes, what are you basing that information on?  And the guy just starts stammering.  Because people said they cut back on the news, I think. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, it's like, do you remember the traffic not being as bad during that time?  No.  No.  I saw a couple more scooters.  The traffic has been the same throughout the height of the gas prices.  And now, you know, it's back down to a low of four years or something like that.  And driving in in the morning, there's not one less car, one more car.  It's the same amount of traffic.  Yeah, it didn't get to the point where you weren't going to drive.  It literally got to the point where, okay, maybe I'll, you know, oh, I won't buy Pop-Tarts. 
[01:19:30]  Whatever.  Yeah, people just, you know, raise the prices of stuff to pay for it.  They, you know, the cabs put the gas, a surcharge.  Are they still doing that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's still the fuel surcharge, even though the gas is back down a buck eight.  We'll never get that back.  That's like planes.  They're still charging 15 bucks for the first bag.  I'm like, the price is coming down.  It's just like, well, you know, we still shut out.  That's why you can't give in to any of this stuff, because they don't give it back to you.  They don't give it back once you're done.  Why?  Once the mass pack is paid for, the tolls will come down. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, really?  Well, why?  It's been paid for 50 times over.  Why did subway costs go up?  That has nothing to do with gas.  That's electric, isn't it?  No, no.  Apparently, electric.  We just both, it was like, here we go.  We're going to start pontificating.  We have no idea.  Well, the electric's got to come from somewhere.  What about hydroelectric?  Yeah.  It just turns into this uninformed, dumb argument.  Well, they need oil to turn the turbines to produce the electricity.  Coal. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, you could have burned coal and ruined the environment?  But the subway costs, remember, it was six rides for 10 bucks.  Now it's like five rides for seven bucks or something?  They're raising the price again for a mass transit.  And what they're doing, though, is they're spreading it around to taxing drivers coming  into the city.  So people that drive in are going to have to pay for the mass transit system.  How can mass transit be broke?  It's jam-packed. 
[01:21:00]  Every time you get on it, it's like, is the Super Bowl in town this week?  Yeah.  Thank you.  It's jam-packed with people.  It's complete.  Anything that isn't making money that has so many customers, it's complete mismanagement.  It's unions just milking everything, not giving any concessions.  Yeah.  Just unions and then CEOs flying jets and stuff.  They're flying their private jets, and they have these golden parachutes, so when they 
[01:21:30]  retire, they can retire with millions upon millions of dollars.  Dude, that's like airlines.  When they always talk about they're not making any money, it's like, dude, every plan I get  on is jam-packed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like-  There's no more standby.  There's no more-  What kind of business are you running where you're sold out?  That'd be like me selling out a club every night.  I'm not making any money, guys.  Yeah.  And then your garage is full of Ferraris and stuff.  It's like, I can't get ahead.  Well, maybe if you weren't a dick buying all this stuff, that's exactly what they're doing. 
[01:22:00]  We should be the only person on a plane at this point, if you believe what they're saying.  Yeah, the whole roadie is selling.  Yeah.  The airlines are operating at a level of illegality that I don't even understand anymore.  I yelled at a guy on Air Canada a couple months back because they were just lying.  They just kept lying and lying and lying about what was going on with the plane and everything.  And I was screaming at the dude, and I was like, I want you to tell me what's happening  right now.  And he goes, you better calm down.  I go, or what? 
[01:22:30]  He goes, I'll have you arrested.  And I was like, for what?  And he was like, I'll just have you arrested.  And he was- I believed him for a minute.  I was like, I'm afraid I'm going to get arrested.  And then I was like, oh, you can't arrest me?  What is he talking about?  Since 9-11, there is this- you have to be on your best behavior in the airport and on  a plane.  You're not allowed to get angry.  And I'm not talking the guys that storm the cockpit to tell the pilot that he wanted another  drink and the stewardess cut him off because he's hammered. 
[01:23:00]  I'm talking about someone who's legitimately pissed at something, has a legitimate argument,  and he's being told no just based on, hey, we had a terrorist event, and I'm your boss  now for this flight.  You sit down and shut up.  Right.  No.  This is my concern.  Hey, the FBI is going to come on and rip you off of this plane and do a full body cavity  search.  And you know what the troubling thing is?  They will.  You'll get a passenger, some of this overzealous friggin' old high school football jock who 
[01:23:30]  decides he wants to tell a story when he gets home that he saved the plane so he sits on  you until the FBI comes and gets you, and then now you're the terrorist guy.  I've already made a mental note that if I ever see them doing that to another passenger,  whatever the passenger's complaining about, I'm going to back them up just so they can  stop with that.  Dude, I got on a plane, right?  I had the aisle seat and the window seat had no seat cushion.  I'm like, wow, that's weird.  I wonder why that is.  And then some lady comes. 
[01:24:00]  She gets the middle seat.  We're both looking at it going, that's really weird.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a broken seat.  Who knows?  And then finally the plane's almost full and the person with the window seat shows up and  there's no seat.  So then we tell the stewardess that, and she goes, what do you mean?  There's no seat.  And then she starts freaking out, and then she starts yelling at us because we didn't  tell us.  She goes, why didn't you guys say something?  You're going to delay us?  It's like, because I don't work here.  I don't know.  It's not my job.  Why don't you start with the idiot who took the cushion out and didn't put another one  for a guy with Continental written on his shirt and yell at him? 
[01:24:30]  Well, how about you idiots that come in the plane before there's anyone on it?  Yeah, how did you not notice?  Maybe you should take a look around and see if there's a missing seat.  Yeah, you notice the guy 15 rows back with his headphones on.  My job.  No, but she came at me with that 9-11 vibe, and the second I said, because I don't work  for the airline, I said something really like, you know, you don't want me to call  Terroristic?  Yeah, should I call the tower?  You want me to call the tower next?  I don't work here.  And then she just sort of walked off, but it's just like, dude, don't talk to me like 
[01:25:00]  I'm in the second group.  Tower, this is United Flight 375 Heavy.  This is Bill Burr.  I'm a comedian.  And apparently there's a seat cushion missing.  Sitting in 23C?  We sent a maintenance crew down here to fix this.  We could take off on time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for letting me fly, United Airlines.  You're right, though.  You can't complain.  You've got to be so timid.  You have to fly like you're a battered wife or something.  Yes!  That is exactly the vibe.  I mean, dude, whenever I'm flying with somebody. 
[01:25:30]  Don't ask any questions.  I have to like tell them beforehand.  I'm like, don't say the word bomb anywhere.  Even if you're talking about, you know, you saw a comic and he bombed.  Like, don't use that word.  Like, I tell them stuff not to do.  Security, just take your shoes off.  Do everything they tell you to do.  Jumping jacks, whatever you need.  Walk through.  And I'm like that.  I'm like so paranoid that I'm going to do something where they go, you know, like an invasion of the bodies. 
[01:26:00]  And I just.  They all just point at you and start chasing you down the jetway.  Donald Sutherland is standing there.  It's frightening, man.  You just don't want to be pegged as that guy.  You do that noise again.  That was the scariest thing.  And Sutherland at the end, you're like, oh, Donald Sutherland's still like, you didn't get sleep next to the pod.  Everyone's on their best behavior.  The paranoia. 
[01:26:30]  No, I've had enough of that.  I went over to do radio the other day and the security guard, like they just, you just give somebody that blue blazer and all of a sudden just the power goes.  You're going to get arrested.  You're going to get arrested.  I literally.  Because you're not going to take it.  I was standing there.  It was this ridiculous thing where I couldn't go beyond this one point.  I don't know what it was.  So I was deliberately lingering.  Near that.  Just to mess with this guy.  And so he keeps looking over at me.  And I keep deliberately acting suspicious.  Just to annoy him.  And then finally he goes, sir, can I help you? 
[01:27:00]  Are you waiting for somebody?  And I just go, yeah, I am.  And I just, I didn't do anything like, you know, he was expecting, you know, well, actually, yeah, there's some people coming down from this show.  And I didn't even do any of that.  It's like, you're waiting for something like, yeah, I am.  Dude, that's me.  I'm the biggest kiss-ass douche.  No, I'm with Bill.  To everybody.  So on Bill's side.  I will never survive a police state.  My temperament.  Yeah, you'll be the first to go.  Yeah.  Unless I see them light somebody on fire.  Then I'll get my head right.  You're the guy in the drive-in theater with the fence around it.  Avenge me! 
[01:27:30]  Avenge me!  Boys!  Boys!  No more crying, boys!  I start screaming at the drop of a hat.  I start screaming at people.  I start, I was in an airport with this comic friend of mine, and we were stuck.  The connection was, whatever, we were screwed.  We were in Nebraska, and we weren't getting home.  And I was furious.  And I'm screaming at the lady, and my buddy goes, dude, dude, flies to honey, flies to honey.  I go, forget to be, ah!  Right?  And I'm freaking out.  And he literally goes up, and he goes, are you familiar, miss, with Rule 42? 
[01:28:00]  And she's like, no, what's that?  And he goes, it's a statute stating that because there's mechanical problems with your airline,  you need to put us on another airline.  She's like, oh, okay, no problem.  And I was like, oh, that's how you communicate and get things done with people?  I didn't know that.  You mean pounding your fist?  Doesn't work.  From the desk and spitting?  Yeah.  All right, listen, we've got to go to break.  So Joe DeRosa has joined the program.  He's playing Carolines with Bill Burr tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  212-757-4100.  I'll be at one of the shows tonight, absolutely. 
[01:28:30]  Beautiful.  And we're doing guest to sound today.  Joe, you're new to the program here.  We're trying to figure out what this is.  Listen.  Now, the sound is like whatever, right?  But look at Danny's face.  Now, Danny's a veteran of internet videos, and he said this is the one that really got him. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, I was telling StumpBrand during the last break, like, I'm sure once I tell you and once you guys see it,  I'm sure there'll be a flood of callers and feedbackers, like, oh, fake, fake, fake.  Like, I wasn't even going to stick around to finish the video out to determine whether or not it's fake.  Like, I don't care.  Wow, really?  I don't care if it's fake.  I'm not watching the video in its entirety.  I will watch up to the point that you probably just heard, and I won't listen to the rest of it.  For all I know, in the middle of this video, he could just stop everything and say, ah, I'll show you how to do this in CGI. 
[01:29:30]  I'm not getting that far.  Wow.  I don't understand why people watch stuff like that.  Yeah, I know.  I did.  I turned it on.  I've gotten roped in, and quickly, before we go, I know we've got to go to break.  I know we've got to, but I've gotten roped into watching gross stuff that I've never watched in my life.  I've been sexual stuff.  I will look at the most heinous pornographic material.  I love porno on the internet. 
[01:30:00]  But now they're mixing some of these sites together with, like, just inappropriate stuff.  So there'll be, you know, a link.  You click on it.  Some hot two chicks, a pillow fighting, and then they do horrible things to each other.  It's fantastic.  And then right under it is a thumbnail for a video of, like, massive head trauma due to motorcycle hitting abutment.  And I see, like, just in the thumbnail, I've got to go, oh, God.  But now I'm seeing that I'm scrolling through those a little more, and I'm getting, like, should I click on that? 
[01:30:30]  I don't think I should.  They're just trying to cross-promote everything now.  Yeah, yeah.  The Jonas Brothers played halftime at the Cowboys game on Thanksgiving.  Stay off that site, because eventually you're going to be like, oh, head trauma.  That's kind of hot.  I'm going to have to look at it.  I have a pretty good example of exactly what you're talking about right here.  I'll just read some names of videos in a row, and then you tell me this is pretty much what you're talking about.  But I recognize that face.  How does it taste?  Dead lady upskirt. 
[01:31:00]  That's three videos right in a row that you can click on.  We have to take a break.  And I know we all have ADD, but we'll try to do the guest of sound thing right after the break, okay?  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, Joe DeRosa, Bill Burr.  Let's get into this guest of sound.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I'm really hating wearing this God-effing bandana every day. 
[01:31:30]  It's atrocious.  It's so loose on your head.  I tried to tighten it up on my head a little bit, and it's just everyone has to comment on it.  I've gotten the same comments.  Well, it looks like you're going through chemo or something.  I know.  It's like I have AIDS, a cancer patient thing.  I got the...  Thomas?  Who is that guy, the child star that had his friend crippled in the car accident, and he did heroin? 
[01:32:00]  Hulk Hogan's kick?  No.  It's that other one.  The stupid singer, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Leif Garrett.  Yeah, Leif Garrett.  Thank you.  It's the Leif Garrett, I don't want everybody to know I'm completely bald look.  Like, Leif Garrett, if you remember, had that flowing Peter Frampton hair back in the day,  and then he just, like, God played a practical joke on him.  Yeah, look at his hair in that picture.  God played a practical joke on him and made him completely bald, where the top, I mean, there's nothing left.  Is that him now?  Yeah.  Yeah, they gave him the bad...  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  God gave him the bad type of bald.  Yeah.  Gave him the little Phil Collins in front.  That's unfixed.  Just to tease him a little bit.  Barely the Phil Collins in the front.  Just to tease him a little bit, like, look, yeah, see?  That's hilarious.  This is what you usually have.  Phil Collins is one of those guys, like, some people just go bald for, like, 40 years, and they never quite get there.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, Joe Torre.  Yeah, they know.  Joe Torre, Phil Collins, they somehow have that runway strip.  Yes.  Forever.  I have that Bela Lugosi.  Yeah, a little point.  I have a theory on the Phil Collins.  I think he was always known for having that look, that he did lose that, then went and did what Ant did, but decided only to give himself a little thing. 
[01:33:00]  That's crazy.  So he could continue to be recognizable.  As Phil Collins with the little...  With the little wisp.  He's gotten it down.  It's thinner than it used to be.  That is the worst hair loss ever.  It's Phil Collins.  All right, let's do guest to sound, because we're running out of time, and in time for the holiday season, we do have...  It's not as bad as his music.  Yeah, I know.  From the 80s.  Phil Collins. 
[01:33:30]  Su-su-sudio.  I like Su-su-sudio.  Su-su-sudio.  All right.  We're running out of time, and we want to get to the gift idea for this holiday season.  Oh, yeah?  This story is the big one today, but first, guess the sound.  So we're trying to figure out this.  I know what it is.  Oh, I know what that is.  Really?  Somebody is taking a liquid dump into an empty tennis ball container. 
[01:34:00]  I think it's liquid dump, too, but what's that?  He's doing it on a plane.  Yeah, that is a plane noise, isn't it?  I think I know what that is.  Really?  Yeah.  And I haven't had any help from anybody, I swear.  You're not cheating today like you did yesterday?  No, yesterday I heard that story on the news.  Okay.  That's why I blurted it out.  But that's – and I won't completely give it away, but is it somebody destroying an appendage? 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  Oh, no.  He's got to debate it.  I know.  He's like, no.  I'm going to go ahead and say no.  All right.  It's not someone hurting themselves?  They might be, but it's – maybe.  Wow.  That's just – it's more – he gave an Obama answer.  No, he answered correctly, though. 
[01:35:00]  Unfortunately, someone blew it for me, so me and Danny know the answer at this point.  It's funny because Jiven, our dump guy, he's like, what's the video?  So I ran in there to show it to him, and I'm like, I dare you to make it through the whole thing.  Wow.  And I got the update, and he did not.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  We'll make it through.  I have a guess.  Joe DeRosa.  Try to keep it clean as best as you can.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  It's not dirty, but I'm going to piggyback what Ant said.  Okay.  Is it a guy with an appendage in some sort of device, like a vice or something like that, 
[01:35:30]  like crushing it or twisting his arm or his leg or something like that, and that's what  the crunching is?  No.  No?  No.  Okay.  So as I was guessing, a blender?  Is it a blender?  Oh, my God.  No, I'll give you a hint.  I'll give you a pretty decent hint.  A guy with a stump taking a liquid dump into an empty tennis ball container on an airplane.  Oh, we can't say that?  Finally, that may be too descriptive.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll just say the first major sound that you hear in the clip is a pretty, I'll say that 
[01:36:00]  that's a very big clue.  The first major sound that you hear.  Well, then, to me, it sounds like a meat cleaver chopping something off, but no.  That would be wrong.  Well, Bobby D. in Brockton writes, just tell me if I'm right, is the guy scraping his arm  on the ground down to a stump?  Could be.  Is it a garbage disposal?  No.  And it's not a blender? 
[01:36:30]  It is not a blender.  Wow.  How can I phrase mine so I can actually get it out to the listeners?  Yeah, it's going to be talking.  Talking code.  Okay.  Somebody is relieving themselves in a liquid form from an area that usually produces a  solid into an empty tennis ball container.  Did I get that through?  You're close, actually.  No?  It was a Pringles can.  No, you're not close at all.  No, I'm saying what is that close to getting it through?  Oh! 
[01:37:00]  Joe DeRosa, back to you.  Is it something with teeth?  Knocking the teeth out?  No.  If it was that, you also have to understand this is something that I could not possibly  watch by Bill saying that it could potentially be someone putting fluids into a cup.  Like, that's fine for me.  I could watch that.  If it's somebody getting his teeth knocked out, I'm not going to have a big problem.  Does it involve someone's private area?  Yes, it is a private area.  Oh!  How about we just... 
[01:37:30]  At this point, how about we just watch the video cold and then we'll have a nice reaction  for everybody out there.  And then maybe that'll help the listeners guess.  And then we'll...  Oh, boy.  And then we'll give it away.  Okay, I'm honestly, like, nervous right now about what this is going to be.  So, I'm not going to watch.  I will press play and I will turn around.  All right, hold on.  Somebody inserted Jiffy Pop.  If you stand up, you can see it over here.  Grab your mic.  Just pull it around.  And there's a liquid.  There you go.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Bill, you got to watch.  I'm watching on that screen right there.  All right.  We're going to watch the video for the first time.  Just the stills on this site are upsetting me already. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  These are really...  Yeah, thumbnail stills are enough to, like, grab you away.  Look at that one.  What's wrong with this one?  Way to a full...  It's that.  That's my guess.  That's what it is.  What is that?  All right.  This is one of my absolute go-to sites.  Yeah, you can't even say it on the air.  I think I got a bunch of material from this specific site.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  Okay.  I'm going to click this and I am going to turn around.  Wow, Danny can't watch.  That's upsetting me because Danny can watch anything. 
[01:38:30]  Danny is a sick mother.  He can watch anything.  Why can't you watch?  Because I don't want to.  Oh, here we go.  Because I don't want to.  Full screen.  Here we go.  Bill, you got to look.  I'm not watching.  Come on.  We're playing this for you guys only with no sound.  So based on your reaction only is what the listeners will base their guests on.  That's how we're playing this?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  No sound?  No.  Okay.  Just give us the reaction.  All right.  Go.  Give us the video.  All right.  I'm out. 
[01:39:00]  I'll narrate.  So you're thinking at this point it's not that bad, right?  Wait.  Hold on.  So far.  Wait.  Hold on.  So far.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:30]  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  This.  Dude, this is horrible.  This is horrible.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm getting that feeling.  Like, you know, like, I'm getting, like, lightheaded and, like, I feel adrenaline in me.  Dude, this is horrible.  Yeah, this is bad.  How is he so calm? 
[01:40:00]  I can't watch this.  Oh, Jesus.  Can I turn it off, please?  Hold on.  How much longer does it go?  For, like, a minute.  I'm still in there.  I'm trying to figure out.  It's still in there.  Bill Never was in there and Joe DeRosa's in there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, this would be a Bob Kelly puke video.  See, he's in trouble.  For real.  Yeah, I'm looking, like, I'm looking to see if his skin color is changing or if, like. 
[01:40:30]  I turned my monitor off, so I'm going to be able to deal with this now.  Oh, this is going to be the new, like, the two girls thing where this is what we're going  to show people.  Yes, yes.  To get their reaction.  This is the new one.  Jesus.  God.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Come on.  You think this is real?  How long is it?  Oh.  See, that's what I'm saying.  I didn't make it this far to pose the question to myself.  Why are you guys still watching this?  Just shut it up.  Oh, damn it. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, God.  It's only getting worse.  It was going so well at the beginning for us.  It was your wife.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm sweating now.  I can't.  I feel sweat.  I can't.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at it pouring.  No one.  Dude, dude, dude.  I see.  There you go.  Bill Burr, Caroline.  All right.  There you go.  Steve.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Is it over?  Jesus Christ.  Wait, wait, wait.  How is he staying?  You know what?  All right.  The last part makes me think.  I'm calling shenanigans.  So am I, and I know why.  That's the exact thing you're thinking. 
[01:41:30]  I don't want to believe it's real, but I'm calling shenanigans.  Yeah.  I'm going to write down why I think it's shenanigans.  Yeah, I think we know because of the.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Somebody have a tissue because I'm crying from gagging.  Is it over?  Yeah, it's done.  It's done.  The job's been done.  This is why.  What was it, by the way, for other people who didn't see it?  We're going to tell them after the break because we're smart radio guys.  Oh, Jesus.  And that's why I think it's fake. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Right.  Very good.  Yeah.  And just the fact.  Because wouldn't that continue?  No.  Well, then that should win some kind of award then.  That should continue.  You're right.  And the fact that.  How about.  No, no.  No.  He was way past that point.  That should have been destroyed.  Yeah.  He wasn't.  He can't do that anymore.  That should have been destroyed.  And the fact.  I mean.  Being able to not.  To function after that.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no.  There's no functioning as far as even the simple function that he did right at the end 
[01:42:30]  of that.  Yeah.  But.  I have an argument for that, but I can't say it because it's going to give too much  away.  No.  Well, we'll argue the whole case after the break.  You know what I'll say?  And without giving anything away, who knows, who knows how much like drugs and stuff like  there might have been no.  Well, you know, I'll tell you this much.  The audio doesn't do the video justice.  I know, but.  You explain this perfectly in your email overnight.  Here's the audio again.  After the break, we will definitely give the answer and we will definitely discuss this. 
[01:43:00]  And now you see why I cringe at the parts I cringe at.  Let me hear the audio.  Yeah.  Bill, could you watch the first few seconds?  No.  I don't know why you guys.  You shouldn't do stuff like this to yourself.  That.  But that's.  No, man.  You know what?  I view your soul.  It's pixelated.  And every time you watch something like that, a couple of cubes float away and you never  get it back.  Is that it?  Peanut butter and jelly sandwich doesn't taste as good. 
[01:43:30]  Air doesn't smell quite as fresh.  That was worse.  Deliberately.  Bill's cut onto something.  What you guys are doing is you guys are going to have that faraway stare that cops who  worked the vice squad and looked at dead hookers for 40 years.  And even when their kids hugged them, they still couldn't feel anything.  You're doing that to yourselves by going on YouTube or whatever and watching stuff like  that.  No, I'm not doing it.  Bill is so disturbed.  He can't even look at anyone right now.  You're not even looking up.  He's just reading a really boring article. 
[01:44:00]  I'm not reading an article about Jackie Mason.  That was worse than the Bud Dwyer suicide video.  And that was the worst thing I ever saw.  Let me think.  He was that congressman.  The first time I saw that.  No, we know the story very well.  The first time I saw the Bud Dwyer.  Yeah, that was horrific.  Now it's just hilarious.  Now it's comedy.  You ever see the rap video they made to that?  No.  It's like 10, 15 seconds.  It's a rap going back and forth.  Oh, it's really, really.  Can we find that?  Oh, is that the one where the guy shoots himself in the mouth?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Politician down in the Philly area.  All right, here's the sound again.  What, that's when he shoots himself in the mouth?  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, the sound adds a whole other texture to it, doesn't it?  Oh, yeah, it does.  After the break, we will definitely tell you what that is. 
[01:45:00]  Also, the gift certificate story, which is pretty brutal, too.  As we go to break, Rich Voss, a true dummy.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to play this production piece again.  Derek and Steve put it together.  We have this new bit.  We show Rich, celebrities.  And then all he has to do is tell us who this celebrity is by looking at the picture.  And, wow, he messes up names. 
[01:45:30]  Introducing Name That Actor on the Opie and Anthony Show  with your favorite non-actor, Rich Voss.  Yeah, hold on.  I got gum in my mouth.  And now for our first question.  All right, I'm ready.  This actor was Remington Steele and starred in several James Bond movies.  Who is it, Rich?  Uh, Pierce Bronson.  Right?  Right?  I knew he was going to say that.  This actor starred opposite Heath Ledger in the controversial Brokeback Mountain.  Who are we talking about, Rich? 
[01:46:00]  Oh, uh, Dillinworth.  What?  Something.  Dillinworth.  It's got a couple names on the end of it, right?  This actor is best known for playing bit parts and retards.  Who is it, Rich?  And no, it's not you.  Ooh.  Like Berdicci or something.  Stay tuned for another edition of Celebrity Password, 
[01:46:30]  only on the Opie and Anthony Show,  hopefully starring Rich Voss,  because he's dumb.  Voss, I wish we had just had a live feed into your brain  so we didn't have to go through the bullshit of your mouth  getting out the words.  All right, finally, we're going to figure out this guess the sound thing.  Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, both playing Carolines tonight.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-0.  What happened?  They spelt your name. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, two R's.  D-R-O-R.  Oh, wow.  Two R's.  D-R-O-S-A.  All right.  So how do you want to work this?  Do you want to watch the video again?  No, I think I've had enough of that video.  Bill, can we entice you to watch the video?  No, I'm done.  Entice me.  We just showed you the Booyah video, and you were...  Yeah, but that was funny.  That was wacky.  This is funny, too.  It was silly.  No, it wasn't funny.  I heard it.  It was kind of funny, right?  It would make you vomit in between the wax.  Oh, man.  We should have showed Bob Kelly this one.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:30]  There would be puke all over the studio.  All right.  Well, the audio is no big deal.  Play the audio one more time.  You don't really know what it is.  All right.  Oh, God.  That sound...  Danny had to walk away. 
[01:48:00]  He's...  I don't like it.  We made it to the end.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  How did you find the video, Danny?  Um...  I saw it, and I read the description for it.  I did not click through to it.  I was just...  I wasn't ready.  I was just like, I'll watch that later.  And then somebody emailed it to me, and I was like, all right, you know what?  I guess I'm going to have to check this out.  It's making the rounds?  Well, it just...  Like, I think it was brand new yesterday.  Oh, okay.  So it's just like...  Somebody...  Fellas, we got on on the ground floor.  Nice. 
[01:48:30]  On this one.  How great.  Yeah, this is good.  This is the next chocolate.  The listeners have to be screaming at their radios right now at this point, like, what  the hell is it?  What is it?  Yeah, yeah.  We've got to do the radio thing every once in a while.  Well...  What the hell?  Well, Ant, I'm going to give it to you, because...  Yeah, I'm good at describing.  The describing portion of this might be a little rough.  Yeah, so listen closely to Anthony.  The sound that you have heard, initially, a gentleman has taken a jar, a regular type 
[01:49:00]  of jar with a screw-on cap.  Like an applesauce kind of jar.  I was close with the mayonnaise thing.  Applesauce jar.  You're right.  He then places the applesauce-type jar, empty, on the floor with the lid on the floor, and  he proceeds to use that jar to do things that men of certain sexual preferences enjoy.  Let's just leave it at that. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  Can I say no hands?  Yes, no hands.  No hands.  You say full feeling.  It's a move that, like, if you were doing something in the woods in order to release a certain  waste product that is not...  Which he did internally.  ...is not a standing by a tree.  Yeah.  You know, this is the position you would be in. 
[01:50:00]  Sure.  So he does that, no hands.  He looks like a Chinese person waiting for the bus.  You know how they crouch down.  Yes, yes, crouch down.  They put their elbows on their thigh, their upper thigh.  And just kind of wait.  Picture your favorite shortstop getting in position.  Well, uh...  Or catcher.  Catcher, actually.  Or the catcher.  Sure, okay.  Like the catcher.  And then he...  Except he's not wearing his pad.  His uniform.  He then proceeds to slowly, um, start to, uh, um, make this jar disappear. 
[01:50:30]  The old hocus pocus.  The old, yeah.  Um, yeah.  Hocus pocus.  Make it disappear.  And he's doing a fine job of making it disappear, to tell you the truth.  Sure.  Uh, it was, it was working out.  It was one of those normal kind of videos that you see where people do this type of thing  and make things disappear in such a manner, until right when the lid is, is disappearing. 
[01:51:00]  I mean, he's made the entire jar disappear.  Right when the lid starts disappearing is when you hear that popping noise.  This is the jar shattering.  Uh, at this point, uh, the jar's remnants must now come back into view.  And he must assist, uh, in this process, uh, using his hands to make sure that there are 
[01:51:30]  no shards, no shrapnel.  You gotta make, you gotta make the rabbit appear at the end of the trick.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the prestige of the trick.  Yes, yeah.  Actually.  Every trick has three parts.  Yeah, he presents the ordinary object, the jar, the jar, and then he does something  out of the ordinary way.  But you have to make it come back.  You need the prestige.  They go out in his backyard, there's a thousand broken jars in the backyard. 
[01:52:00]  Tesla?  It'll be great if the camera shot pulled out and you see those Electroid machines.  Yeah, the big Tesla coil is going.  Ah, the prestige.  David Bowie is standing there.  Obsession is a young man's game.  See, that was the problem with this guy.  He never got his hands dirty.  Yes, he never did.  He finally got his hands dirty, I see.  And then he was actually removing these shards. 
[01:52:30]  He fills the jar.  He makes the jar disappear.  The jar explodes on impact.  Well, the jar doesn't get filled with anything.  It's completely empty the whole time.  It's just sitting on the floor.  He then makes the jar disappear in a way that certain people might find pleasurable.  It then pops and he then has to remove where it has popped in shards because it's a broken glass.  And you see some damage has been done to where this glass had disappeared to. 
[01:53:00]  There's a lot of stuff escaping.  When the glass is finally slowly revealing itself by being taken and placed on the floor, it is full of damaged material.  There's a lot of stuff that the human body needs to survive that is also mixed in with the glass.  And, yeah.  At the end of the video, it simply looks as if somebody dropped a full jar of, let's say, Smucker's strawberry jam on the floor. 
[01:53:30]  Smucker's.  Yes.  Yeah, it does.  It looks like Smucker's jam.  Onto what?  Chitlins?  Now, here's a...  How are you not understanding this completely?  Like, yeah.  I didn't watch it, Anthony.  Yeah, but I thought I was...  I guess you're going to have to watch the video.  But Bill is the...  He's the ears of the listeners.  I'm trying to convey this in a way that everyone would understand, and apparently I'm missing the mark here. 
[01:54:00]  I'm distracted by your do-rag.  Yeah, I would be, too.  Hold on.  Dawn in the Bronx wants in.  Dawn, go ahead.  Oh, my God.  I am gagging on my way to work.  I'm going to take Anthony's do-rag and chute right into it.  Oh, nice.  Keep my follicles moist.  Dawn, by Anthony's description, do you understand what this is all about?  Yes.  All right, good.  It's very disturbing.  It's not appetizing at all. 
[01:54:30]  I'm nauseous.  Ugh, I'm getting sweaty.  I've got to turn down the heat.  It's gross.  I got to...  You know what she sounds like?  Have you seen that commercial where they bring people to a five-star restaurant, and then  they serve them, like, Burger King pasta?  They're like, oh, my God, it is so decadent.  I like that she used...  Who calls macaroni and cheese decadent?  Decadent.  I like that she used the word appetizing.  Yeah.  It's not appetizing.  Nobody said it was appetizing.  That's what I'm saying.  I never came into this argument in any way.  Nobody said, this is a delicious little video that we found. 
[01:55:00]  I've got to say, Angry Pirate, he's a regular from New Hampshire.  He writes, for the love of Christ, you have 350 FM listeners.  Just effing say it and let the locals bleep it.  This is the fun of trying to describe this horrific thing for regular radio.  Yeah.  Don't you get that?  You'll be able to explain it in another seven minutes.  Yeah.  Who's upset?  We'll give you the Angry Pirate, but he doesn't understand how this is... 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, we understand we're working with censorship here on regular radio, but it's kind of fun  to work around that and try to get the point home to Bill Burr and some other people out  there.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Sometimes just saying it is, you know...  Sometimes you like a little skidamax.  Yeah.  Going into the mix.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, at the end of this video, the guys say, the aristocrats.  Yeah, that's definitely an aristocrats moment.  I was a little shocked, though, thinking it might be faked. 
[01:56:00]  Well, when he stands up, right?  He stands up too normally.  He stands up because he's in that position that a catcher is normally in, and then he just  stands right up, and I would think you'd fall over and think...  Well, hold on.  And the reason why he's standing up is because he's going for the, ta-da, I'm done.  Is that it?  Yes.  Ta-da.  So does the video make it look like the jar was supposed to break?  No, it looks like he wasn't supposed to break that jar.  Oh, really?  You think that wasn't part of the trick? 
[01:56:30]  No.  I'm not sure, because even in the description where the video was posted, the poster clearly  states that he's not quite sure if this was intentional or not.  Dude, I've seen so many videos where it's just like, hey, let me see if I can do this.  Right.  And you watch the video and go, oh, my God, I can't believe that's happening.  So that was a mishap?  Yeah, it looked like a mishap.  Why would you do that on purpose?  You know, Joe, we're jumping right over the obvious reason, how we know it's fake.  There is no screaming.  There is no crying. 
[01:57:00]  There's nothing.  He doesn't make a noise.  He doesn't fall over.  He doesn't go, oh, my God, there's no crawling away.  There's no, you know, to the phone.  It's ruined.  That is true.  It's ruined.  If that had happened to you or something like that, let's hypothetically speak, would  you, I mean.  Would you call in sick?  I'm trying to run through it in my head, right? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It's like, all right, so I like that kind of thing.  I'm home.  I'm by myself.  Oh, you do.  I'm going to put this on my webcam, right?  Yeah.  I don't know if I would be in the mindset to just start, like, I would freak out.  But I don't know if I would start screaming.  Like, I'd just start panicking and just thinking I have to make sure.  You're trying to justify it.  You'd be out of your effing mind.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know what it is?  He wouldn't be that calm like he was in that video.  You'd be running around the house freaking out.  I panicked before.  That's why I think he meant to do even the mishap and going for, here is something that 
[01:58:00]  people are going to be talking about for a long time.  I don't know.  Because that's a potentially fatal thing that he did there.  Maybe the guy's dying.  Absolutely.  This is his way out.  I'm going to go out in style here.  I'm not saying he's got to be screaming, but, you know, maybe a, oh, my God.  Or something, you know, like, whoops.  There was nothing.  There was nothing.  Nothing.  Not a pee.  Not even like a Homer.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Ah, geez.  This is going great.  This is going great. 
[01:58:30]  Ah, wow.  Well, yeah, it's fake.  It's got to be fake.  Well, Jim from the back is saying, the dumb guy is saying that that's why he thinks it's  not fake, because imagine how fake we'd think it is if he was overacting.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You know, screaming like crazy.  Maybe he is thinking, the first thing I have to do is get rid of this.  Oh, the jaw broke in my ass. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  I hit the button on that one.  Jesus.  After that.  Oh, I can't say that.  After the ballet dance I did to describe that, you're just going to blurt it out.  Was that Ray Romano?  It was supposed to be.  You just stepped on Anthony's ballerina toes.  Yeah.  Now he.  I danced around that to get the description out so people know.  And then you just blurt it out.  And then a wrecking ball came in from off screen.  Yeah.  The dumping ball.  Let's go to.  One of those dangerous comics, man. 
[01:59:30]  We certainly are on the edge.  I have a leather jacket.  Let's go to Rick in Connecticut.  Rick, how are you?  Fonzie of comedy.  Yes, I do.  What's up, Rick?  And your description was dead on.  Real or fake.  Yeah.  You know.  Dead on.  It's one of those videos you don't even.  I just want to jump in.  It's one of those videos you don't even really care if it was fake.  It's just.  Yeah.  It transcends whether it's fake or not.  It was fake, but it was a great movie.  So, yeah.  While you're watching it, you're not thinking whether it's real or fake. 
[02:00:00]  You're just watching it.  Yeah.  And then you try to pick it apart like every video you watch.  He could have been in the mindset of, oh, my God.  I have to get this potentially fatal object out of any place that might really hurt before I move.  Yeah.  You know how they tell.  They're like people in a car accident.  It's like, don't move them.  Don't move them.  We got to put the neck brace on.  Maybe he thought that like I shouldn't budge.  I should just make sure all of this is taken care of before I try to maybe get to a phone, call 911. 
[02:00:30]  That's a good point because, yeah, you would do more damage if you started running around the house.  Yeah, stop moving around, jogging.  Yeah, I'm assuming this guy has read up on this procedure.  Probably.  I just kind of had an idea.  Okay, if something goes wrong.  Right.  But still, a peep.  Something.  Maybe he's done it before.  You ever see people like they've separated their shoulders so many times they can just pop it in and out?  Oh.  I mean, if you just constantly.  Yeah, if you're constantly.  It's just like what we saw.  Very understated acting in that, by the way.  Yes, of course. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Hey, boys, check it out.  Thank you.  Best performance by a mullet.  With simple home editing, though.  Stupid hair.  With simple home editing, he could literally seamlessly cut together the shot of the disappearing act.  Yeah.  Immediately to a new shot of him being fake injured.  And it would be seamless and you would never know.  Right.  At this point in time.  Yes.  We're now treading on Occam's razor.  Now, are we going to start?  Are we going?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Back up. 
[02:01:30]  What is Occam's?  It's the principle that.  It's not like Falcon's maze.  It's the principle that the simplest explanation.  Is that like Murphy's Law?  It's the principle that the simplest explanation is likely the correct one.  So did this guy go through this elaborate setup.  What does that have to do with a razor?  Just to make that twist off.  Thank you, Bill.  He was shaving when he thought of it.  Wait, what is it?  The simple principle?  I don't like how that's how you described it either.  No, guys.  It's the simple principle.  Obviously. 
[02:02:00]  You can't look like the big ragu and then say Occam's razor.  That's not fair.  Occam's razor.  It's the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one.  All right.  So how does a razor work into it, though?  Bill, I don't know.  I'm as uninformed as you are.  Don't use expressions.  You don't understand.  I watch Contact, and now I use it in everyday life.  That's what I was asking for.  That's what he got it from.  All right.  He has no idea what it means. 
[02:02:30]  I just explained it to you.  It's like the limit test.  You know, Jodie Foster says, you know, it's a spaceship.  Something like that.  Hey, let's go to Bob in Connecticut.  Bob.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Good, Bob.  You cut off the last three seconds there when he goes, and that's how you executive produce.  Yes.  You know, there's a gentleman that, you know, that ilk that's used to that kind of punishment 
[02:03:00]  in that general vicinity.  Yeah.  So, I think you guys are making a good point, like with the dislocated shoulder and things.  Yeah, that is just used to that.  You're so used to that, it's a blunt trauma, you're not going to feel anything.  Yeah, you don't start with the jar.  It's not blunt trauma.  It's sharp trauma.  It's bleeding.  It's, you know, it's an injury that is potentially life-threatening.  I want you to use your imagination.  If you're on jars at this point, how many other objects, living or not, have been in 
[02:03:30]  there scurrying around?  To jars.  Hundreds.  Yeah.  Once you've had a rodent.  Hundreds of things.  Yeah.  Hundreds.  Once you had a rodent in there.  Wait, someone is saying he does scream at the end?  Dan, you've seen the video?  Yeah, I Googled it from the description that Anthony gave, which was fantastic.  Oh, thank you, sir.  And the last few seconds, he lets out a scream when he stands up, if you have the volume on.  Oh, really?  I didn't.  Oh, that's right.  I admitted.  I admitted that he didn't want it. 
[02:04:00]  The first time I saw the end of that video was right here, right along with you guys.  Dan, could you get the scream for the other side of the show?  Oh, that's great.  And then we'll try to determine whether it's a real scream or a Meisner technique.  Sure.  Whose razor is that?  Occam's.  Occam's razor.  Yeah, Occam's razor.  Where the simplest thing...  Take Occam's razor to your throat.  I'm trying to think of, like...  You and your stupid razor.  Dumb it down like the rest of us, will you? 
[02:04:30]  Sorry.  I thought some of you guys had seen contact, my band.  I remember that part.  Yeah.  This is the classic situation, your friend's trying to keep you dumb.  Yeah, I know.  What, are you trying to get smart over this?  It's like the simple, uh, what they call Occam's razor.  Let me explain.  The simple premise.  Yes, Professor.  Professor Ross.  I go, what does that mean?  He goes, it's the simple premise.  The simple.  The simple.  All I'm trying to say is that...  Dan, you are an ass.  I know I am.  Shut up.  But this video, it's not going to come out that this video is like viral marketing for some 
[02:05:00]  video game.  Somebody get him a lab coat.  He's going to be one of those fake lab coats.  He's wearing that Super Mario Brothers cap that he's sitting over there.  Dr. Ross has said many times that...  The best part of that was his confidence.  He stood up and pushed his chest out.  Well, watch what I do to you guys here.  Let me present the theory.  We're talking about a jar up, up, up, uh, yeah.  Well, we're talking about a jar.  Yeah, we're talking about a jar.  You know, Bill and Joe, when I, you know, what I'm helping about with Uninformed, they always 
[02:05:30]  find a way to smash my brains in, no matter what's happening.  One time, I wore, like, a t-shirt, like, twice, and they were just like, oh, you wear  that every day, and it was like, it went on for 20 days.  No, yes, you have the worst.  I worked at a carnival in 84.  And you didn't even, you weren't even, like, the guy with the good game.  It's the stupid thing where you throw the darts at the balloon.  Yeah, I'm good at that.  Danny's the guy that wears any t-shirt somebody gave him for free.  He'll have, like, a TD Bank t-shirt. 
[02:06:00]  You would think Danny actually, Danny actually, uh, buys expensive t-shirts that look like  cheap t-shirts.  Which is even worse.  Yeah, either that, or he wears those Armenian designs.  Yeah.  Dude, I used to see Armenians out in L.A., man.  They, they cannot buy a shirt that's just plain.  It has to have, like, this psycho...  Sort of scrolling, uh, his calligraphy and...  Tons of moose, and then they drive Maseratis.  I don't know what they're doing for their money, but it's great.  Hey, do you guys see the body shop? 
[02:06:30]  I don't know if it burned down, but, uh, the legendary strip club out there in, uh, L.A.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that the one on Sunset?  Yeah.  So I've heard.  Wow, burnt down.  Hey, now.  Personally.  Yeah.  So, all right, we gotta get out of here.  The phones are lit, but we gotta go.  Yeah, yeah, we do.  They need to play some rock and roll here in New York.  Look at Anthony's a mess.  He's got a watermelon down by his feet.  He has watermelon on the floor.  I'm wearing a dopey do-rag.  Hopefully this goes...  Were your hands trembling as you brought it up? 
[02:07:00]  By Monday, I'll be back to, um, I guess, uh, my, uh, military hat.  I don't think you look like you have AIDS.  I just...  You look like the senior gangster at the poker game.  Hey, Vato!  Yeah, I just got a button, the top button of my shirt.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a much better look.  I'm gonna walk down the street like this.  Hey, Vato!  Wow.  Wow, look at that.  That's it.  You look like the guy that throws...  No, Holmes!  I think I shot you in Grand Theft Auto.  You look like you're gonna throw Ethan Hawke into a bathtub at training day. 
[02:07:30]  Two on!  Two on!  Two on!  All right, we gotta go.  Listen, we might not be here Monday, and, uh, we're not even fooling.  We have no effin' idea what our future holds.  No.  Well, then we should have described the jar.  We better do it.  Yeah, no kidding.  Really got him thrown off.  No kidding.  At least we know he went out with a big laugh, right?  Stump brain.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, you got Joe DeRosa, you got Bill Burr, both of the Carolines, tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  That's right. 
[02:08:00]  Uh, it's a, it's a great, uh, that's gonna be a great show between, uh, the both of you.  It's a powerhouse lineup.  Bill Burr's got a brand new hour.  Joe, I'm sure, has got new material as well, right?  Yeah, yeah.  212-757-4100 for tickets.  I'll see a bunch of you tonight at one of the shows.  And that's it, I guess.  Mep, mep, mep, mep.  Have a good weekend.  Hopefully we'll be here on Monday.  If not, there's always the satellite.  See you guys soon.  We'll be right back. 
[02:08:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:09:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:09:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:10:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[02:10:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:11:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:12:00]  I'm in shock.  I guess now that we're on satellite radio, we should now describe the video just to show you the world we live in.  Oh, yes.  About a half hour ago, we were describing the video very carefully.  Yeah, we were.  Carefree.  Huh?  Very careful working around the FCC rules and regulations.  You know, we got to kind of watch what we say.  Describing something as horrific as what we were describing is not an easy chore these days on regular radio. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Well, now we can tell you exactly what that video is about for the people that were too stupid to figure out.  I don't know what the fucking video is all about.  This fucking naked faggot.  Holy shit.  He puts a fucking jar on the ground and proceeds to squat over the jar without using his fucking hands. 
[02:13:00]  He shoves it in his ass completely.  In his fucking ass.  His fucking ass.  And the fucking thing disappears.  It pops.  Now, his fucking asshole decides to squeeze at that very moment.  Hey, was it his fucking asshole that makes the fucking thing pop?  Yeah.  That fucking asshole was gaping.  He's got a few fucking fists in there.  That thing's like muscular.  Yeah.  He's used to squeezing down on some fat cock, I think.  You know, to make the guy cum in his ass real easy. 
[02:13:30]  That's right.  You don't want to seem loose.  Real nice-like.  Yeah, real nice-like.  A lot of fucking hot cum in his ass.  That's right.  So you've got to be able to squeeze that big fat cock with your asshole to feel something.  Enough jizz to fill up that fucking jar that he then sticks in his fucking ass and he breaks  with his fucking asshole.  This guy's taking a few fists up his fucking ass.  So as he's squeezing his fucking jar with his asshole, with his fucking asshole muscle.  Yeah.  I bet it was a pickle jar. 
[02:14:00]  The thing pops and makes it sound like a fucking light bulb.  That's fucking hot.  And then all he's got is a jar broken up his fucking asshole.  Fucking A.  Just shards of sharp broken glass and blood.  He got a male fucking abortion.  Right.  Yeah.  Brood.  And the visual is his blood pouring out of his ass.  Out of his what?  Out of his asshole.  Out of his what?  Out of his manhole.  Out of his fucking asshole. 
[02:14:30]  His stink fuck ass.  There you go.  His stink fuck ass.  It's pouring down his hands, blood.  And then every so often a big globule of glass, blood, and shit comes out of that fucking  asshole.  The next thing this fucking faggot does is he now puts his hand in his fucking ass.  Deep in his ass to pull the glass out of his asshole.  He had the other hand pulling his fucking ass open so he could get his fucking other hand 
[02:15:00]  in his fucking ass.  Well, I liked how he had the whole fucking jar up his ass.  And then when it came time to remove the glass, he's got like two fingers gently.  He was dainty.  I can't have it.  He's being dainty.  He's feeling around to see where the fucking glass is stuck.  Stick that fist up, you fucking man cunt.  Up the back of your fucking man cunt, you cock sucking fuck.  You look like you got an ass period, you fuck.  Look at you.  Get a man pond. 
[02:15:30]  And then he finally gets the glass out of his fucking ass.  Yeah.  He stands up, which he'd fucking fall over.  And did a ta-da.  And then there's no more blood pouring out of his ass when he stands up.  But I heard you had some fucking audio of the guy screaming in the air.  Yeah, where's the fucking audio of this freak fuck fucking screaming?  That's a fucking load of shit.  Yeah.  Because I just looked and there's no fucking scream.  They put it in.  Ah, the fucking site they put it on, they fucking put it in.  Ah, that's fucking fake. 
[02:16:00]  It's not fucking for real.  That sucks.  That description.  So it's fake.  No, no, no, no.  It's fucking fake.  The fucking video cuts.  And then that's where the scream is.  That's the glass.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it was just tagged by the website.  It's a fucking sound effect.  Bullshit.  Well, that description's for angry pirate.  There you go.  Fucking idiot.  That's how he wanted us to describe it.  Yeah.  Was that dirty enough for you?  Yeah.  You fuck.  There you go.  Yeah, because the one guy was upset.  You fucking ass pirate.  That it was too fucking clean, the way we described it over there. 
[02:16:30]  You know, sometimes it's the drag, but every once in a while it's kind of fun to kind of work around the rules.  Kind of work around.  I enjoy doing that.  I enjoy doing that.  I enjoy doing that.  I enjoy doing that.  I enjoy in his ass.  I enjoy.  I enjoy broken his ass.  George is a job in his ass.  We got a gay guy that's very.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Jason.  Jason, how are you, my friend?  Jason.  Jason.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  So, uh, as a gay man, that made me cringe. 
[02:17:00]  Did it?  You haven't done anything like that before?  Uh, nothing glass goes up there.  What about like a shampoo bottle?  Can I ask why you have to say, can I ask why you have to say as a gay man?  Because I think as a straight guy, it made everyone cringe.  No, because he's assuming.  He's had shit up his ass.  Yeah, he's had stuff up his ass.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that why you're saying that, Jason?  Yeah, but.  Yes, that's why I say that.  But the straight guys have had a finger or two every once in a while.  A finger is different than a fucking jar or a man's cock.  I had a finger break in my asshole before. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, damn.  They had to pry it out.  Prying out knuckles and fingernails.  Knuckle hairs.  Nice.  Hey, dude, you ever have a dick in your ass?  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  Don't be silly.  Duh.  Of course.  And, uh, God, that can't be a treat, huh?  Boy, you have no secret.  Not for you.  Oh, bless you, Anthony.  That dick in the ass talk makes me sneeze.  When you sneeze, do you lose any of the hair restoration?  Nah, it's all in there now. 
[02:18:00]  No follicles are going to be popping out like fucking bottle rockets when I sneeze.  Yeah, he can't sneeze for the first couple days.  Yeah.  I was a little scared of sneezing.  Yeah.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  And then, uh, I wasn't drinking or anything, but I was afraid of, like, getting sick and  puking.  You know when you're puking so hard and nothing's coming up that you know your blood pressure  is like a fucking fire hydrant in your head?  Yeah.  You just feel like, bleh.  You go, bleh.  And you're just holding that and thinking, how long can my stomach muscles fucking contract 
[02:18:30]  like this?  Your eyes are red.  And that would have just fired him out of my head like the grand finale at a Grucci show.  Fucking follicle fireworks in my bathroom.  Making hair shapes in the air.  Yeah.  How many times do you puke like that, though?  Me, once every maybe five years.  Food poisoning.  It's not often.  Food poisoning, sure.  No, with me, it's drinking too much. 
[02:19:00]  If I drink, and I mean way too fucking much.  But you're puking like that, not on a regular basis, but more than the average.  I would say probably once every six months, I'll tie one on to the point where I puke.  Really?  Not that bad, but, you know.  Every six months you'll vomit?  About every six months I'll puke.  And I don't puke when I'm drinking.  I will puke, I swear to you, I'll come into this show, like hungover, I'll go home, and  like at noon, I'll be like, oh my god. 
[02:19:30]  Noon the next day, I'll start fucking puking.  I'll start feeling like all fucked up and really hungover.  I'll have to put a rag on my head and lay in bed and just moan, oh, oh, I'll never drink  like that again.  Never, never, never.  Feeling the cold steel of your gun to comfort you.  Oh, yes.  Oh, some of those guns are so nice and cold.  You just hold it against your head.  I puke sometimes to like, you know, make some space or whatever.  You know what I mean?  Like, I'll puke and be like, I'm going to be sick if I don't make myself puke. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, yeah, I've done that too.  And it's like self-cleaning, you know what I mean?  Joe, are you bulimic?  I really just sound like you were bulimic.  Bulimic with booze.  I like to stay fit, you know.  I've done that with booze, though, where I've been so drunk and like it all of a sudden  hits you where you're like, oh, I'm getting kind of double vision-y and, you know, I'm  really getting the spins a little bit.  Yeah, that's what I do.  I'm going to take care of this right now, so you hit the bathroom, you puke, and then  I stop drinking after that. 
[02:20:30]  You go to water and aspirin and just hope for the best of the next morning.  I've actually sometimes gone into a bathroom knowing I have to puke and I can't puke, so  then I just do a big inhale, just smell the bathroom, and I puke.  That usually gets you.  Yeah, just let it out.  And then there are so many triggers for puking the next day for me.  I can't eat, I can't think of eating until well afternoon.  Like, sometimes I don't eat the whole fucking night or I'll throw up.  It just makes it worse.  And if I think of, no, because if I think of food, I'll puke.  And all breakfast food actually will make you puke. 
[02:21:00]  Greasy fucking pork.  Yeah.  Pork links.  Or eggs.  Runny, runny eggs.  I can't even think, if I think about it, I'll throw up.  I have to sit there and go, stop thinking about it.  I've got to put like a movie on and just like put the rag on my head.  You watch Big Night.  Drink water.  Drink water in increments of like a dropper.  I drink like a gerbil.  Like you're a baby bird.  Yeah, yeah.  I have to just drink real slow.  Water will make me puke when I'm hungover because it sits so heavy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  So that's why I've got to drink a little bit.  And then about five or six o'clock I go, I think I could have something like grapes.  Something that's like watery and not dry.  Like a cracker would fucking make me puke or something like that.  And then once you like get up the energy and you can stand to take a shower, then you kind  of get out of the shower and you go, ah, I'm kind of ready for a beer.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  No, I don't drink that day.  There's no fucking way.  I puke again.  Well, that's good news.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did that hair of the dog thing once because people always talk about it and I 
[02:22:00]  was like, no fucking way.  And I did it once and it does work.  It kind of works.  It really does work.  You go, wow, I felt bad.  It doesn't take much.  I felt like I was on death's door three minutes ago.  Yeah.  I drank this beer.  I feel fantastic.  You feel great, dude.  Just jump starts it all.  I feel fantastic.  But the bad thing is I'm at work.  Yeah.  And this isn't good.  Hey, you know what's fucked up?  When I watch those intervention shows, they make me want to drink. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I just watch them and these guys are like boozing and I just, I just, I was spontaneous.  We'll go out and go get like a beer.  Yeah.  There's a guy, I don't know if I told this story, but this guy, he was just, he was just  drank Budweiser's and he, the way he described getting up in the morning and he would drink  a beer in the shower, the fucking ecstasy in his voice.  I was like, dude, I'm going to fucking try that.  I got to try that.  Did you?  He was like, no, I never did.  But he was talking like, you know, you hear the sound of the beer opening and the water's going  over your head.  It was like one of those cheesy commercials.  And I was just like, dude. 
[02:23:00]  You have a hot shower and a really cold Budweiser?  I've done, I've drank beer in the shower before, but it's not like I'm going to purposefully  drink a beer in the shower.  I've been drinking a beer and been like looking at my watch and go, I got to go out.  So I got to shower.  So I know the beer is going to get like piss warm or lose its fizz if I put it in the  fridge or whatever.  So you'll be in the shower and, you know, just kind of put the beer to the side so no  water hits.  And every so often you take a swig.  I've smoked.  I've smoked cigarettes in the shower.  In the shower?  I used to smoke.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Like just smoking.  You keep that one hand dry. 
[02:23:30]  You're shampooing it one hand.  You're just like, yeah, I'll just finish this cigarette, you know, and then you put it  in the drain and grind it into it.  Are you thinking how fucking out of control your habit is?  Never.  Never.  I'm just thinking, this is easy and it's, I'm having a good time.  I'm enjoying my vices.  Yeah.  And then you're not going to smell like smoke because you're washing it right out of you.  You wash it off of you.  Yeah.  You're washing it off of you.  It's fantastic.  And then when you get done with the shower, you light up and have another one anyway and drink  another beer.  Hey, before we continue moving on, I just. 
[02:24:00]  Because everyone wants to know, look up one guy, one cup for the video.  We got to turn some people on to that because they're having a tough time finding it.  Back to Joe.  Sorry.  Joe DeRosa.  I was going to say one of the sickest days I ever had after drinking.  I worked in the mall one year at a kiosk by myself, right?  Oh, wow.  I think it was cell phone accessories.  Oh, those annoying people.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Do you have a cell?  Shut the fuck up.  If I need a cell phone, I know where to go.  Dude.  And it was literally at the height of like the cell phone accessory craze. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And I remember one day one guy came in and he goes, you have any Confederate flag face  plates for the cell phone?  I really hate black people.  And I go, as a matter of fact, we do.  I go, as a matter of fact, we do.  And I show it to him.  He goes, nah, it's not good enough.  It's like, what do you want?  A fire hose on the front of the fucking thing?  You have something with the flag and a noose?  Yeah, exactly.  So I had to work one New Year's Day because I was a low man on the toll and pull.  Oh, fuck.  And I drank until literally probably 6 a.m., went to bed, got up at 9.30, and went to work. 
[02:25:00]  And I was so hungover.  And I was going into the bathroom all day, puking while I was working.  And I remember-  Who was guarding the cell phone stuff?  Nobody.  Fuck him.  I was in the bathroom.  I'm in the bathroom, dude, and I am vomiting like, like horrible.  And I walk out of the stall, and there's like a 6-year-old kid peeing by himself.  And I just pictured the kid's dad being like, you're a big boy now.  You can do it by yourself. 
[02:25:30]  And he goes in to pee alone.  There's some creep.  You've ruined his first pissing alone experience.  People are probably stealing shit every time you went to the bathroom.  They figured out your pattern.  Yeah.  No, it's 5.  What?  What?  What were you trying to do?  I was looking for this.  What? 
[02:26:00]  The gurgles of them.  Gurgles of them.  Is he okay?  Gurgles of them.  Is he okay?  I'm going to be okay.  That hurts.  That hurts just listening to it.  Dude, Joe, you should have done that eggnog drink.  That's the eggnog drink contest.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, that is the funniest fucking thing. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, it's just, that was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Comedy.  We might get the eggnog drinking contest back, maybe.  They drink until they puke, and when they're puking, it's all this gurgling.  It's amazing.  It sounds like an outboard motor.  Joe, have you ever seen Baby Bird video?  I saw the video of it, yeah, where the kids over the trash can, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude, his face was just, he looked like fucking powder by the end of it.  It was like a big fucking bukaki video.  Dude, but even like, all the strategies people have, like, remember the guy, there was one 
[02:27:00]  guy, anytime anybody would puke, he would just turn around and face the wall, we were  calling him Blair Witch.  Remember that guy?  That's right.  And he would just so nonchalantly just stand there.  He didn't want to look at the guy puking, or he might puke.  Then the other guy was pouring it on the Froot Loops, and then he was trying to make  Oh, he fucking ate it.  The terrorist.  Sergeant Magoo, man.  The terrorist.  Good old Sergeant Magoo.  Dude, he fucking poured the puke on Froot Loops and ate it.  Rancid fucking.  Who was the kid with the beard?  Jesus Christ.  Remember when he takes the big Viking swig out of it? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, God, God.  I'm kidding.  Dude, he literally, he goes like this, dude.  He goes, what?  And then he goes, what?  I'm going to get sick.  Dude, I know.  I'm really, that was some of the worst shit ever.  I could not tell the story without gagging and simultaneously crying laughing.  Yeah, I know.  It was, it was too fucking funny to watch.  I got to ask E-Rock, because it's one of our lost shows.  We got to find it.  We're still finding our old shows.  But our best puke show ever, I still think, is the Super Bowl tickets that we did at BCN. 
[02:28:00]  But did you ever find that show?  I think we have it.  I don't know if I cut it up.  We had a clam chowder eating contest.  Oh, yeah.  Do you have it?  I don't know if it's ready to air, but I know where it is.  Get that caught up, and let's promote that we're replaying that for the first time in years.  No, wait, we don't.  I'm telling you, I think that's one of the ones we still don't have.  That's one of the shows that were stolen.  The Dats are missing for that one.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we got a lot of our old shows back, and some of the really good shows were missing for some reason. 
[02:28:30]  We still don't know who decided to do that.  Very selected shows.  Collectors' items.  They are collectors' items.  But basically, we had Super Bowl tickets.  But because it's radio, we had the tickets.  It was when the Pats were in the Super Bowl.  When they played the Packers.  Where was that Super Bowl?  97.  No, where, though?  It was in New Orleans.  No, no, it wasn't 97.  It was like 2001.  Oh, it might have been.  2001 was also in New Orleans.  They played the Rams.  So we were going to give you the tickets, but you had to find your own way there.  It's actually February 2002.  Yeah, definitely February 2002.  So we decided to have a clam chowder eating contest. 
[02:29:00]  We miscalculated.  We wanted these idiots to eat a bowl of clam chowder every two minutes.  They could only get like two bowls down before the contest.  Completely sucked.  And then we came up with another pair of Super Bowl tickets, and these people were puking  because they were eating so much clam chowder.  So Ant and I decided that the first person that could take a, I can't believe they let us  do this, a spoonful of the puke from the clam chowder that was puked up, not only eat 
[02:29:30]  it, but could keep it down, would get the other pair of Super Bowl tickets.  A very simple concept, right?  It was like watching them pass the spoon around the room trying to keep the clam chowder down.  It was like a fucking rodeo because some of these people were like, I think I got it.  I think I got it.  And then you would just see their whole body like convulsing.  You know what sucks about that?  If you're going to do it, keep it down so you get something out of it, and then you  actually, oh.  But they were trying.  They swallowed it. 
[02:30:00]  It's so hard to even talk about this.  But I guess the taste in their mouth was still there.  They were just thinking about what it is, and your own body is rejecting it.  It knows it's not good.  There's also Anthony's colorful descriptions of goopy, creamy, chunky.  Yeah, look at that.  Filled to the tippity top with good, viscous, creamy chowder.  And every time someone puked, everyone else would puke, and the contents just kept going  The whole studio smelled like the cafeteria when someone vomited in it as a kid.  And they'd put that sawdust down. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, yeah, it would just still stink.  Dude, the audio you have from the year before the baby bird of Paffamunaki, that puke hit  in that empty glad bag is the funniest fucking sound.  Dude, this guy, he's a diabetic, first of all, who lost a toe to the disease, and he's  drinking fucking eggnogs, and he was the champ.  He would drink like 70 double shots.  It was like, yeah, it was literally like, it was like Lake Erie, a fucking eggnog would  come out of this and hit this empty trash bag and hit this glad bag. 
[02:31:00]  That's what made me come in.  Not only is he puking up the eggnog, it's curdling, because I guess it's warm in his stomach,  so now it's chunky.  It's the acid in your stomach, too.  I've never seen that one.  Do you have that one?  No, the audio of it made me laugh so hard, that's why I ended up showing up the day  of the baby bird.  That's hilarious.  You needed to be part of it.  Oh, it was just too funny.  We gotta find the clam chowder fucking show.  I'll find it.  That's still one of my favorite shows of all time, and we lost it years ago. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know why I find puking so goddamn funny.  It's the sound people make.  It's just...  It's the involuntary noises you have to make when you throw a... 
[02:32:00]  You know what's funny?  There's no reason to make a sound there.  You're not trying to speak.  There's no reason.  You can just open your mouth and let it come up, but you don't.  You gotta...  What the fuck is that?  You know something?  That would be a great contest.  Have somebody puking and see if they can actually read from a manual. 
[02:32:30]  Somebody puking's funny.  You know what's really funny?  When somebody tries to block it and the pukes come in between their fingers.  There's no holding puking back with your hand.  Yeah, people sometimes feel compelled to hold their hand over it as they're running for  the bathroom or something, and you just see it squirting out between their fingers.  Well, Bill, we might get the eggnog drinking contest back, so...  We lost homeless shopping because they wanted approval from the mall, because I know people 
[02:33:00]  out there are wondering, but SiriusXM's like, yeah, we'll let you do the homeless shopping  spree, but we want the mall to approve this bit.  And we're like, that ain't gonna happen.  And Keith went to the mall and they laughed at him.  So once again, homeless shopping spree is on the shelf.  Yeah, that ain't going off, but we're working on the eggnog drinking.  You ever have a friend driving the car, and there's drunks in the backseat, of course,  and they puke out the window, and the next morning you just have this puke fucking flame 
[02:33:30]  paint job down the side of your car?  Dude, we had a guy in our crew, he was known as the puker.  And the worst thing, not only did he puke, but he had no concept of, I'm gonna puke.  You know, like, you feel it, and you're like, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.  He would just be sitting there, like, eh, mid-conversation, and he's just, wha!  All across, it's all across the windshield.  So my buddy had this 79 T-Bird, right?  It's like July, I remember it was the summertime, and we were coming back from the Cape, and he 
[02:34:00]  puked.  The window was down, and he still put his head between, and puked on the floor mat.  My buddy was so pissed, he's like, yo, I'm fucking cleaning that up, blah, blah, blah.  He dropped the kid off, and for some reason, because he was hammered, he put the windows  up, and the kid didn't come to it until, like, the next day, like, 12 in the afternoon.  It was, like, 80 degrees out.  Oh, my God.  I don't know, it was probably 120 in, with this puke just cooking.  That car's done.  I was at a party once.  Me and my buddies are wasted, and it's the end of the night, and we're sitting there just 
[02:34:30]  talking, just shit-faced.  And there was a couple, you know, a guy and his girlfriend, and his girlfriend is like, you  know, just out.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, just mid-conversation, she bends over, and she's going, blah, blah,  and just puking all over the ground, and we're laughing so fucking hard at her, and he's  rubbing her back, and he's going, it's not funny, guys.  No, fuck you, it's hilarious.  You'd be laughing your fucking balls off of someone else's chick, dummy.  Yeah, exactly.  You ever, early on, like, when I was fucking 15, 16 years old, and you're just trying 
[02:35:00]  to get with a girl and shit like that, at a party, there was this girl, and she was drinking  too much wine and shit, and she was all fucked up, and we were all fucked up and making out  and shit like that.  Oh, gosh.  At that point, you're just like, you know, you got a rod just from making out, all that.  Yeah.  You're just, you know, you're pumping, and she just proceeds to puke her fucking guts  up, and I'm just still thinking, all right, finish puking, because we're taking up right  where we left off.  We're going to skip first base? 
[02:35:30]  We're going to move right to second.  She leans over, and she goes to kiss me again, and I just open my mouth and start kissing her.  Did you get Super Bowl tickets?  No Super Bowl tickets, but I tasted fucking wine puke breath.  But I didn't give a shit.  You're 15.  You're 15 fucking years old.  I don't care if a cunt smelled like puke.  I was going to put my mouth on that, too, motherfucker.  Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, I was trying to get with this chick, and she was completely 
[02:36:00]  hammered, and she threw up what looked like an entire can of SpaghettiOs everywhere, and  probably about a half hour later, I'll make an out with her.  I just didn't give a shit.  That's what it always looks like, by the way.  It always looks like SpaghettiOs or fried rice.  It's one or the other.  Nobody ever just pukes up like a steak.  Yeah, the stomach really does some damage to that food real quick.  Just turn it into SpaghettiOs and send it down the chute.  Fuck it.  Oh, my God.  SpaghettiOs.  Let's take a quick break.  Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, not only are they doing Caroline's all weekend long tonight, tomorrow, 
[02:36:30]  and Sunday, they're going to be doing a little uninformed from 11 to 12 today.  And for any Boston listeners, I just got this date.  In February, I'm going to be at the Wilbur Theater.  Sweet.  Bill Burr at the Wilbur.  I already know people are going to give me shit about that.  At the Wilbur Theater in February 6th, and then out in Chicopee, Massachusetts.  Hi, Chicopee.  Oh, Chicopee.  I probably take tea.  And these guys will do uninformed from 11 to noon, so we've got live programming all the 
[02:37:00]  way until 3 o'clock today.  So, very, very cool.  When we get back, the doctors, that show we take a peek at every once in a while, explains  queefing.  Oh, they're not going for fucking ratings, are they?  And the gift certificates that are available for people this holiday season, we found one  that's just amazing.  It's all over the news.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  I really believe this show is way above radio.  Just a bit of tongue, Gungry.  You'll get that.  Way above other radio shows.  How about a quick, just a quick sniff?  He's so queeping. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  Oh, this is so disgusting.  It absolutely smells like bad breath, but there's something else mixed in there.  No!  Yeah, it assaults you.  Oh, that's not right.  We're above radio.  Awesome.  First three songs are so awesome.  We were talking about music during the break, and I was asking these guys, and I think I'm 
[02:38:00]  sort of onto something.  You're into a band, so into a band where you've got to get everything they do, and then one  day, like, your obsession for this band just goes away and it passes you by.  Yeah.  And I say this because I was a huge Metallica fan, and I couldn't name one song off the new  album, and I'm thinking to myself, what happened?  That all of a sudden, I just didn't even want to search it out and listen to the new 
[02:38:30]  Metallica.  The band didn't change.  They don't suck or anything, but all of a sudden, I was just like, oh, Metallica.  But it wasn't your reason.  And I said to Bill, has that ever happened to you?  And you said it happened with ACDC.  Yeah, I tapped out for a while, and then I kind of...  But before you tapped out, you had to, like, know everything possible about the band, right?  I had all their albums right up to the Heat Seeker one, Blow Up Your Video, that album.  I didn't like the cover, and I couldn't get into it, and then I just, I don't know, 
[02:39:00]  I just fucking just tapped out.  And then Joe ended up getting me into the albums, like, Ball Breaker and the shit from  the 90s, because I was just like, all right, forget it, I'm done.  Well, Thunderstruck was where I, after Thunderstruck, I tapped out.  For no real reason.  I've still never bought that album, but, like, every time I'm at a football game, I'm like,  you know, I gotta get this album.  Oh, my God.  Well, look, Thunderstruck could be my favorite ACDC song ever, but the album just, like I  said...  What else was on there?  I played another song off that when I was doing music radio.  The first three songs are Thunderstruck, Fire Your Guns, which is awesome, and then Money 
[02:39:30]  Talks, which is a great tune.  Yeah, I knew Money Talks, of course.  And then it just goes...  You know, and I love ACDC, I'm not shitting on him.  But then Rick Rubin got him in the studio, he got Phil Rudd back, and they did Ball Breaker,  and that album is fucking awesome.  And they've been great ever since then.  I was telling Bill, we got Angus Young on the phone, and after the interview, people  were like, wow, he was on for, like, 40 minutes with you guys.  He usually does five minutes tops.  He hates doing, like, phone calls.  We had him laughing, though, man.  We had a good time with him. 
[02:40:00]  He was pretty good.  He was...  Yeah.  I'm seeing those guys at the LA Forum this Monday.  I get worried when I watch Brian sing, though.  I really think he's going to hurt himself.  Yeah.  He puts his head down.  He does.  He puts his head down.  His mouth does.  Just trying to get it out.  That box set, Bill gave me the Plug Me In box set last year for Christmas, and, you  know, it's video of them through their whole career, and the last clips are from, like,  their last tour before this one, and they do Thunderstruck, and watching Brian Johnson, 
[02:40:30]  you know the part that's like, you know, it's, like, so high?  Watching him try to hit it, dude, he's literally going down like this, and he just, he looks  like he's going to have a fucking seizure.  And it's so funny, man.  You ever pull that muscle, like, in your neck?  Yeah.  He must be, he must pull that muscle all the time.  He puts his head down.  Like, he doesn't, like, lean back to try to get the note, but he just puts it.  Yeah.  How is the thing that happened to DMC with his voice, how did that not happen to Brian 
[02:41:00]  Johnson, where his voice is all fucked up now that he can't talk anymore?  I think it's just, yeah, and he's messed his voice up rapping.  Yeah.  He's like, I rapped an octave too high for 10 years, and now I can't talk anymore.  It's like, how the fuck is Brian Johnson still?  Yeah.  That guy is singing just, singing like that is meant to just fuck your throat up.  But maybe he did fuck up his throat, but it's a type of, you know, style he's got that you  wouldn't know.  Well, I heard his friends, when he joined ACDC, immediately told him on the Back and 
[02:41:30]  Back album, they said, you're singing too high.  Like, his natural register, I think, is more like a baritone, but just their music called  for, I think he was so like, I have to follow Bon Scott.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck this shit.  This is my big bank.  And he just came.  Back and Black!  Yeah!  Yeah, just fucking went through the, it's ridiculous, the notes he's sitting on that album.  And then the funniest part of that DVD set, you know, you're sitting there going,  okay, if I was going to sing a concert like that, I'd have to sit and meditate for two  hours to get my voice loose enough to come anywhere near that. 
[02:42:00]  They show them, they're doing like a concert in Russia, he is smoking, literally to the  point when he walks on stage, he's like, you know, taking the last drag.  I'm like, what the fuck is this kind of made of?  First note he sings, you see smoke come out his mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he's literally, he's like a pirate.  He was just born in the wrong time.  Like, he really should be out at sea.  Yeah!  Yeah, speaking of that, he's swinging around in a wrecking ball.  Maybe nine bottles of pants!  He's on a wrecking ball.  Yeah, he's swinging around in a wrecking ball at one point. 
[02:42:30]  Paul Blinker!  He's like 80 years old.  Holy shit.  Like a fucking pirate.  I literally, I have great seats for this too, and I'm really hoping that it's not going  to be...  It's not going to be...  Dude, the reviews are great.  We got one from Keith out there in San Francisco.  Keith.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I went and saw ACDC last night at the Oracle Arena here in San Francisco.  Bring it on.  What'd you think?  Dude, they were incredible.  I mean, Brian Johnson's voice was pretty much gone after the second song. 
[02:43:00]  But it didn't matter.  But he still sounded awesome.  Yeah.  The only thing is, their original drummer, Phil Rudd, he, I don't know, I think when  he was gone for a while, and I think they had the other drummer, Chris Slade, the bald  guy, I think he was a lot better.  And Phil Rudd's kind of lost a step.  But dude, they sound awesome.  Angus Young is incredible.  That guy just ran around the stage for an hour and a half.  That's unreal.  Okay, good.  How old is he?  How old is he now? 
[02:43:30]  I think he's, I think they said he's like in his early 60s.  No, he's 50, he was born in 1955.  Malcolm was born in 53.  I'm a key.  Well, he looks like he's 80.  Bill, cover your ears.  I want to ask him, I don't want to ruin something about the show.  I want to ask him something, though, because I'm not going to say it.  Okay, well, I don't want to ruin it for you.  Hey, what did they open with?  They opened up with the very first track on their new album.  Oh, okay.  That's a lick, man.  Yeah.  I hate when they do stuff like that. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, and it's the single.  It's the first song, and it's the single.  Come on, they're pushing the album.  You've got to do it.  That means they don't believe in the single if you're starting with it.  Yeah, you got it.  You got to go right into the catalog.  Yeah, come out and open with, that's like, Thunderstruck is the way to open.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Get the whole crowd.  Oh, when they open with that on the live with Jerry Lewes.  You know we have to play Thunderstruck now. 
[02:44:30]  I want to hear a little bit of it.  Maybe we'll play it to end the show before these guys continue until noon.  Rush knows how to open a show.  They come out.  I'd love to watch Rush.  They came out right with Tom Sawyer a few years back.  They came out with Limelight last tour.  Come on.  They know what's going to make the people go.  They're fucking awesome, those guys.  Why not?  Like, everyone's so pumped up.  I've never been into them.  I've never been into them.  I always thought it just sounded too fucking robotic. 
[02:45:00]  But I actually watched concerts.  Yeah, they really impressed me.  Getty Lee just always just, you just want to beat him up.  There's just something about him.  He's just a guy.  You just want to stuff him.  He's got his voice as the other.  Yo, I got to say, at NAW, we had Getty Lee in.  He couldn't have been cooler.  And we had that big monster stripper in, and he really enjoyed the hell out of it.  He was really cool.  If you're looking for their singles, they're not going to pretty much play their singles.  A lot of their earlier stuff they play, but a lot of like Heat Seeker and Thunderstruck, 
[02:45:30]  they didn't play.  I went to see Thunderstruck.  Wow.  Thanks, Keith.  I went to see, I was so into Blue Oyster Cult years ago.  Because, you know, I was from Long Island, so it's the law.  What is that?  Don't Fear the Reaper?  Well, that was one of the commercial ones, dude.  Those are the commercial songs, dude.  I was into like, you know.  Joe Crawford is there?  No, that sucks too.  Were you burning for them?  All the stuff, yes.  I was burning for them. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, that's why I'm burning, I'm burning.  No, I was into like the stuff, you know, that was really obscure.  All their obscure shit, you know.  And they used to play all of it when you'd see them live.  And then I saw them at the Black Sabbath, the Black and Blue concert,  and the Nassau Coliseum.  And, you know, they would just, they'd come out at one point  with the Five Guitar Army and just like fucking all playing guitars.  And it's just loud as fuck and everything.  So then I go, oh, they're playing in Huntington at that theater on Main Street. 
[02:46:30]  Right near a certain, no, no, no.  It's the place that was right near a certain restaurant  in the heart of Huntington Village.  I don't know what the restaurant is.  Oh, F.H. Reilly's?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it was a theater.  It was a theater.  I don't know if it still is.  They used to do laser light shows.  Yeah, laser shows and all that bullshit.  But then Blue Oyster Cult was playing there.  And I'm like, fuck, you know, let me go see Blue Oyster Cult.  So it's well past their fucking prime and shit. 
[02:47:00]  But I figured, what the fuck?  I go in, I'm watching, and I could turn to the person next to me and go,  so they sure sound a little different in this voice.  They sure sound a little different than they used to.  Yeah, they look a lot different, too.  I think it's a different drummer.  They were playing songs like it was a fucking lounge act.  And their whole thing was about the volume and just rocking.  Their ears must have been shot.  And they're just playing their songs, and the volume was really low. 
[02:47:30]  What age do you think, where you can still leave Johnny Carson and still be classy as a musician?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's different for every band.  Oh, it is.  It is.  Because look at U2.  They've been around forever.  And Bono, they could still go out and fill arenas.  Bruce is another one.  He could go out and fill fucking arenas.  But then there are other bands that it's like, you know,  who's going to go see fucking Winger?  You know what?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Or Poison.  What fucks up a lot of that 70s stuff, as good as it is,  it's fucking great stuff, but it's like Deep Purple's a good example.  Some of the old Deep Purple shit is so good, dude.  Like Highway Star.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But dude, a lot of it is the way it's produced.  I mean, the way that 70s rock is produced is so thick and full of texture.  And then you hear it live, and now it's like tinty and clean,  and it just fucking ruins it.  Yeah, it really does.  It was all, their equipment just sucked.  Yeah.  Distortion was part of the sound.  Yeah, it was like, you want to distort this? 
[02:48:30]  You've got to cut a hole in the fucking amp.  The stuff was better back then.  It was made better, and now they got it like,  I think the way they make the guitars and everything.  It's all very clean.  Yeah, like if you go on eBay, those old beat-up guitars are getting like 25 grand,  15 grand, these old fenders and stuff because the sound of them or something.  Like, I don't know.  I'm not into that end of it, but I think too much of that, like, what's that shit?  I was trying to talk to you about that on Uninformed, that auto-tune that people are singing with,  like a lot of those R&B guys. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It puts their voice in key.  Kanye West did a whole album where he's not rapping, he's singing.  Dude, that album is dog shit.  I fucking hated him to begin with.  That album blows cunt.  Yeah, they use a pitch correction, and you could hear it.  Like, especially, some of them use it as an effect and turn it up like that Cher song.  Do you believe?  Where her voice did that weird fucking thing you'd hear.  Like, it would step up, like, very digitally, but there's a way to set that where it's not 
[02:49:30]  as digital sounding.  You're trying to sound like a little more analog, but it's still, you can tell.  The Paula Abdul setting?  Yeah, the Paula Abdul, I can't fucking sing.  That should have started and ended with Peter Frampton.  I think he was the first, and he should have been the last.  Oh, the talk box.  Yeah, well, I guess that's different, obviously.  That was unbelievable in the 70s, though.  People were like, oh, my God! 
[02:50:00]  That guy was packing places.  He's another one God just played an awful trick on.  Gave him that big head of hair for Frampton Comes Alive, and then right after Frampton Comes  Alive, like, all of his fucking hair just started.  Frampton goes bald.  Frampton goes bald.  He must have just shampooed his hair once after that album shoot and just found the drain  full of fucking tribbles.  Did you ever see the story of that?  He talked about, I saw an interview with him and talked about that album.  He goes, yeah, one day I wrote Baby, I Love Your Way, and whatever the fucking talk song 
[02:50:30]  is.  He goes, I wrote those in one morning before I had breakfast, and I've been trying to have  a day like that ever since.  You're like, dude, you really blew your load.  Totally blew the load.  You could clock, literally clock the hours that you blew your fucking load.  There could not have been a bigger album than Frampton Comes Alive.  It's still a great album.  It was giant.  It must suck.  You get the inspiration like that, and you're thinking, ah, I'm the next Beatles. 
[02:51:00]  This is going to be easy.  I'm going to be writing songs every fucking day from now on, and it never happens again.  Like the Blues Brothers, what you were talking about.  We were listening to Blues Brothers live, whatever the fuck it was.  And you said how, well, it was playing at a club.  We had to listen to it.  But it was, Bill was just saying, like, you were saying how popular the album was.  It was a craze.  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  And they made the follow-up bomb.  They were like that.  Two comedians of Sketch Comics actually had a top ten album.  Yeah, yeah.  The musicians they played with were incredible.  But then they had their second one, Made in America. 
[02:51:30]  Woo.  Pretty bad.  Really bad.  Going back to Miami.  Oh, just these terrible, terrible fucking...  Was it better or worse than Bruce Willis' little debacle?  Bruno and the heaters.  Bruno.  Bruce Willis and all those, they ruined.  Because actually, the Blues Brothers, their first album, man.  I mean, like the musicians they had on it were fucking incredible.  And they did like a...  Aykroyd always stunk, but Blue, she did a real passable job.  I mean, for what it was, and it was sort of joking around and shit, it was good. 
[02:52:00]  But, like, yeah, like all those other bands or that guy from Full House, whatever the  fuck he would do, they would always weave something into the story where he had to play  drums or...  Dave Coulier had a band?  He had to weave something into the story.  Who's who's?  Yeah.  Somehow we always had maracas.  He was like the Ricky Ricardo one.  John Stamos.  John Stamos.  John Stamos.  He was in that Beach Boys video.  Kokomo.  He played drums on it.  Yeah.  Going back to ACDC for a second.  Doug B. is Salt Lake City. 
[02:52:30]  He saw ACDC in the 80s.  Open show with Angus banging a huge bell center stage for Hell's Bells.  That's awesome.  That is fucking cool.  I think it was Brian.  No, Brian would hit it with the hammer.  Yeah.  Yeah, a big hammer.  Because then Angus would be playing, I believe.  Bong.  This guy's going to get pissed.  Fuck you, man.  I was there.  Because Angus had to play the fucking guitar during that part.  Yeah, you were.  Where the bell is fucking going, then he's playing the riff.  That is a whole way to open a show.  I'm trying to think of the best open to a rock show ever that I saw.  You just don't get that.  There was a certain fucking feeling about walking into an arena. 
[02:53:00]  And you find your section.  You walk up.  You come out through the fucking big cement fucking opening tunnel to your section.  And it's just a shitload of people.  You sit.  The lights go out.  The band comes on.  And there was this fucking just energy that you would just, yeah!  You got all kinds of shit.  You just fucking, fucking A, this is the best line of my life. 
[02:53:30]  First time I ever saw cocaine being done was at an ACDC concert.  People would pass joints around each other.  Providence Civic Center.  I just remember seeing this kid.  And he was like burned out at, like, he was like probably 15.  And he looked like he was 30.  And he just came up to me and was like,  I was like, I was trying to match his intensity.  Like, please don't scratch me.  Don't bite me.  My first Metallica concert, you know, Metallica's great. 
[02:54:00]  They put on a great show.  And there's all these explosions and everything.  And I was at Madison Square Garden.  And I have like mediocre seats.  But you could still like feel all these explosions going off.  So the guy I was next to was shirtless and just completely like ripped and sweating.  You know, screaming at every lyric.  Oh, shit.  And so one of the explosions start going off for one.  Right?  And he just turns to me and goes, can you feel the heat, man?  Can you feel the heat?  And I'm just like, yeah.  And then two seconds later, he just put the joint like in my face. 
[02:54:30]  So I'm looking at him and I'm like, I think I'm going to have to smoke a joint today.  It's really the only place where you can just pass pot around and drugs and no one gives a shit.  Like, there was always people passing joints around.  And even if you didn't want it, you just passed to the guy next to you.  Like, you didn't know where it came from, what was in it.  And then there'd be another one coming the other way.  And then, like, there'd be a wine satchel would come past you.  And you'd, like, squeeze some of that into your mouth and just keep passing it.  Now you're getting dated. 
[02:55:00]  They didn't have that in the 80s.  A wine satchel.  That was at the Charlie Daniels concert.  Like, you were in the Robin Hood and his Merry Men.  That's a Long Island arena with Charlie Daniels and Molly Hatchet.  Dude, I saw Metallica at the Civic Center in Philly.  And it was the greatest opening to what you said.  Yeah, we want to get back to that.  Ecstasy of Gold.  Oh, dude.  They play Ecstasy of Gold.  That's where we stole that shit from.  Right?  They play Ecstasy of Gold.  30,000 seats.  With the video, by the way.  Yeah.  30,000 seats sold out show at Civic Center in Philly. 
[02:55:30]  Ecstasy of Gold.  They come out.  They open with fucking battery.  But they play the acoustic intro with the lights down.  Lights go up.  You know?  And I'm like, I'm getting chills right now talking about it, dude.  I was like, holy shit, this is fucking awesome.  And you know when it goes into the breakdown in battery?  The...  Right?  They get to that part.  They stop on a fucking dime.  Right?  Everybody's going crazy.  And James Hetfield goes, Philadelphia! 
[02:56:00]  Metallica is with you tonight!  Oh, shit.  And everybody goes, are you with Metallica?  And 30,000 people, whoo!  And he goes, all right!  No counting nothing.  Just right into it.  And I was like, holy Christ, dude.  I was going fucking crazy.  And they come right out of that.  I know it.  Right out of that.  And he goes, Philadelphia!  Give me an M!  M!  Give me an E! 
[02:56:30]  Hey!  Give me a T!  T!  Give me an A!  Hey!  Give me an L!  L!  Give me fuel!  Give me fire!  Give me an M!  These fucking guys are un-fucking-believable!  And you know what's great about them, too?  They'll fucking...  They'll talk.  They're not one of these bands that'll just run from song to song to song.  They'll occasionally say some shit, but they never get too wordy or too political.  They don't have some fucking message or whatever.  They just want to kick your ass, and they do it every fucking time.  And they're fucking great.  They're fucking great. 
[02:57:00]  I got shit.  I got shit from...  That's the best when he does that.  Yeah!  Then you get crowd wars between James and the crowd with doing yes back and forth.  He'll go, yeah!  And then the whole crowd...  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Jim was giving me shit about a year ago, because we were talking about the last time they were  around, they played at the Nassau Coliseum two nights in a row with Godsmack.  And they played some songs that they hadn't been playing in a very long time, and they 
[02:57:30]  played Dire's Eve, dude.  Yeah.  And it hit me.  I had a little tear come down my eye.  I was like, yeah, baby!  I saw them twice on that tour.  Once was Philly, once was Nassau.  I went two days in a row.  Yeah, between the two shows, I saw all of Master Puppets and 90% of Injustice for All.  Dude, I know.  Most of the ride, The Lightning.  Dude, it was fucking unreal.  I think I went to some of the worst concerts.  Just when I came up, it was all hair metal.  Oh, I remember when I saw ACDC one time, this band Loudness, it was a Japanese heavy metal 
[02:58:00]  band, opened up.  Oh, heard of Loudness.  Yeah, and they were like, they couldn't even, I don't think they could even speak English,  but they sang in English.  Yeah, but they didn't know what they were saying.  Oh, thank you for coming down to it.  And they kept playing.  It was fucking horrific.  I saw, my first concert was Doc and Judas Priest.  Oh, wow.  The Turbo Lover Tour.  Oh, Jesus.  And I literally stood there as I was, everyone was going nuts, and I was watching a guy basically  fingering his girlfriend. 
[02:58:30]  She had those, she, he was, this is while I was going down.  Like, she was like up, like back up against him.  Like, leaned, like looking over his shoulder, making out with him, and he literally had  his hands right down the front.  I'm going to forget, she had those, you know, those pink spandex with the leopard print on  it?  Oh, wrong.  And he had his hand right down it.  And I was like going, ah, he's, he's fingering her.  He's fingering his chick.  I'm electric, electric.  And it was, gay ass Rob Halford is running around looking for cock. 
[02:59:00]  Turbo Lover was the name of the tour?  That was, that was, yeah.  Was that a Judas Priest album?  Yeah, Turbo Lover, 1986, that's when they kind of jumped the shark.  Why don't we go to the phones?  Everyone's got their greatest opening to a concert.  Gary in D.C., how are you, Gary?  Hey, man, good morning, Gary.  Good morning.  This is especially for Anthony, but it's probably 1996, 97, Kiss at Madison Square Garden.  Kiss, get out of wood.  They have the big Kiss light lit up, and they came out and fucking played something with  the dumb makeup on, fucking prop act. 
[02:59:30]  Shut up.  Yeah, then blood came out of Gene's mouth all over the place.  Was he wearing his big shoes and his axe guitar?  Wow.  It was like fucking kids.  He just killed his story.  A little kiddie band.  Oh, he hates Gene Simmons.  A fucking kiddie band.  Just don't bring up Gene Simmons.  Gene.  Gary.  It's good.  It's a franchise.  I have two more really bad concerts.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to hear what the opening was.  Yeah, what was the opening?  They had this giant curtain on the stage, so the stage was blacked out, and, you know,  they have the, and they're the biggest fan of all time, Kiss, and you hear the opening 
[03:00:00]  to Detroit Rock City, and then massive explosions, and there they all are in their costumes.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, opening with a big explosion is pretty cool with the band, you know.  Sitting there, and you go, oh, fuck, they're doing business.  I saw Def Leppard on that, that, uh...  I get hysterical.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hysterium.  Let me get that feeling. 
[03:00:30]  Let me get that feeling.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yes.  I didn't know any better.  I saw them, too.  I want to hear Photograph and all that.  I saw them, too.  Oh, Dark Leap.  I want to all that.  Talk of Ages.  Yeah, this stuff is good.  Horsop, sugar on me.  And you're going to understand a word he said.  Yeah.  Sugar on me.  Oh, and you've got to sit there and pretend like a one-armed drummer is good.  Look, man, he's fucking playing with one arm.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  It's inspirationally hung in there, but...  But please. 
[03:01:00]  Phil's having a moment.  When I saw...  That is it, dude.  When I saw Kiss last time they were around for their farewell tour, two farewell tours ago,  and we all went.  We all went to the Garden or some shit, or it was in Boston.  I don't even fucking remember anymore.  But I went to see him, and I didn't realize how few fucking hits they had.  I thought Kiss had like a shitload of fucking familiar songs.  Oh, that's terrible.  And I'm sitting there going, I don't know this one.  I don't know this fucking self-indulgent piece of shit. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know this.  Oh, Gene's going to fucking do one of the songs from the album with his face on it.  And they put out the four albums with all the fucking...  Well, you had to have all of them.  Just sucked.  I was sitting there going, this is a waste of my fucking time.  I never liked them.  The first Kiss song I ever heard was God Gave You Rock and Roll.  And I was like, fuck these guys.  How we doing, everybody?  Dude, it was Guns N' Roses.  And I believe I saw them in...  I want to say Toronto.  With Skid Row opening up. 
[03:02:00]  They opened 80,000 people, something like that, to Welcome to the Jungle.  Holy Christ.  That was a fucking open.  That's a biggie.  I had tickets to go see Guns N' Roses, but my brother was going through a brutal breakup.  Right.  Though I gave him my ticket, so I didn't go to that.  And then literally, like a couple months later, somebody had free tickets.  You never go to one of those...  John Cougar, Mellencamp.  Dude, it was the most boring...  What did he open up with?  I don't remember, but you know what he did?  He stopped.  I was born in a small town.  I don't remember. 
[03:02:30]  Is that right?  That is Mellencamp.  And I live in a small town.  I'll probably die in a small town.  How many times are you going to say small town?  With any whole fucker.  And I love that douchebag.  He tries to put out this whole, hey, I'm just a blue-collar guy.  Yeah.  And then they show footage of him backstage, and he's like, get the fucking explosions off!  Where's the fuck...  Where's my fifth guitar right now?  Yeah, that's blue-collar regular guy.  Dude, he opened with one of his awful songs, and then they stopped, just like Metallica,  but in a really bad...  Just stopped, and then he took time to wave to everyone, like in each section of the crowd. 
[03:03:00]  A really long, self-indulgent wave, and I would just write, yeah.  Did he start with a little ditty?  You know what was a great opening?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you just really hang yourself with your ditty about strings, please.  A little ditty about strings, please.  A little ditty about Jack and Diane!  How are you...  What do you...  Was everyone just sitting in their seats, watching?  It was...  Everybody was like fucking 35, 40.  It was horrible.  And we went to a Mellon Camp show when we were at NAW.  We had to.  Before we said, fuck the music, and started talking on it. 
[03:03:30]  We had to go.  I saw Fleetwood Mac with Squeeze opening up.  Oh!  And at one point...  That makes you gay.  At one point...  I'm just telling you the bad ones I saw.  I saw Skid Row with Aerosmith, but the bad ones are so much better.  Oh, dude, I got a bad one that trumps yours.  The Squeeze guitarists, like, they had, like, that one-and-done song, whatever that song  about cheating on your girl was.  So at one point, he literally runs into the crowd up the alley, and there was no frenzy  whatsoever.  We were all just looking at this idiot running with his guitar through the crowd. 
[03:04:00]  Like, he was going to get mobbed, and he needed security.  We were all just like, hey, there's that idiot.  I don't know what his name is either.  You want a pretzel?  Dude, I was a huge police fan growing up, and for the farewell tour, I went to the garden.  Oh, the most recent one?  Yeah, B-52s opened up.  Oh, God, they blow.  Oh, my God.  They blow.  There's a side of the house on the fucking road.  Yeah.  Jar in your asshole. 
[03:04:30]  It always, and I think it was a surprise.  You were hoping for maybe some cool band, and it's fucking B-52s.  Here's the worst concert I had to go to, and again, a chick.  It was all because of a chick.  I had to go because I wanted to fucking, I want to fuck.  That was it.  Whether she's puking or not.  Whether she's puking or not, I don't care.  If I'm going to make out with a girl that just puked, I'm going to a concert she wanted  to go to, I sat through Jackson Brown. 
[03:05:00]  People stay just a little bit longer.  Lawyers in love.  I sat through that shit.  She's got to be somebody.  I sat through that shit.  What was your first show?  To hope I just got fucking late.  My first show was probably, like, should you get Charlie Daniels or some shit?  Try to guess my first show. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  I can get some.  Foreigner.  Wow.  I wish.  East Coast Band.  Jukebox Hero?  Really?  Did you really want to see that live?  East Coast Band within a 50-mile radius of where we are right now.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Then we're talking.  Bon Jovi.  White Snake.  Or White.  Who was the fire?  You got to go back a little further.  No, the band had the fire.  Who was that?  This was Great White.  Great White.  This was early 80s.  Eddie Money.  Oh, Eddie Money's a good guess.  Southside Johnny.  And the Asbury Jukes. 
[03:06:00]  Southside Johnny.  The poor man's Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Look, we're from Jersey, too.  No, you're not as from Jersey as Bruce is.  Southside Johnny.  Johnny.  Everybody's trying to jump on that.  They had to put Asbury in their name.  Just to be like, hey, look at us.  He didn't have enough songs, so he played Having a Party for like a half hour.  We're having a party.  One of those moments where, you know, they don't have a big enough catalog, so they stretch 
[03:06:30]  all their songs out.  All right.  That's like going to see Boz Scazz.  How many times are you going to do Lido?  Lido.  Here's a bad one.  I went to a Bush concert, and I crowd surfed.  Oh, no.  I crowd surfed to Glycerine.  I hope someone fingered your asshole.  Dude, we went to a Bush concert. 
[03:07:00]  We had to again.  Yeah, but remember all the little girls screaming.  All you heard was, there was this high-pitched scream like locusts were coming down or something.  There was a whole bunch of little girls screaming about Gavin fainting.  It was great.  I'm trying to think if I have any more bad ones.  I've got to redeem myself.  I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I did see some good guys.  Stevie Ray Vaughan ruled.  There was a lot.  There was a lot of bad.  I saw, see, David Lee Roth.  I'm trying to remember the opening.  No, no, no.  What was your first show, though?  Eat Him and Smile Tour.  Yeah.  Which was Doc and Judas Priest. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, you said that?  Yeah, where the dude fingered the girl.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I saw Journey.  Right.  I saw Journey.  With the Asian guy or with the...  No, no.  The original lineup.  The original fucking lineup.  You hear how the new guys sound?  They were on the rock stations back then.  It was weird because they were, like, accepted as a rock band back then.  You listen to the music now, you're like,  what the fuck is this faggot shit?  But back then, you're like,  yeah, anywhere you want.  It's fucking rockin'.  Love it, touch it, squeeze it.  Yeah.  It's like, this isn't fucking rockin'. 
[03:08:00]  This is faggin'.  They fucking blow, man.  Oh, yeah, but back then...  They fucking blow.  This is the shit.  I don't know why.  We were all psyched to go.  Journey is like Toto,  except they try to act like they're not Toto.  Toto wears it on their sleeve.  Hey, man, it's fucking Africa.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Fucking Toto.  Saw such shitty bands back then.  I saw Phil Collins.  That was my second concert I ever saw.  But I liked it.  Not Genesis, though.  Just Phil Collins.  You can't beat up Phil Collins too much. 
[03:08:30]  No, I liked it.  Later in his career, yeah, but...  Right after, somewhere after 82, 83,  whenever that Susudio shit came out,  that's when they just lost me.  Dude, it wasn't even Susudio that.  He lost me when he did that fucking song  about the poor fucking homeless people.  Oh, yeah.  What?  What?  That was the opening to the concert.  Oh, dude.  Think twice.  Yeah.  Because it's another day for you and me.  It talks about how, you know,  some lonely old stinking person  is fucking eating shit out of a garbage pail,  and I can give a shit...  I used to be a big Genesis fan. 
[03:09:00]  I saw them on the reunion tour.  You pay him, Phil.  Genesis got so funny.  Let me be a cabana cash, you fuck.  Genesis was one of those bands  that started off really cool  and ended up so freaking faggy.  Yeah, it was like a progressive rock band,  jam band, which I was never into.  I saw them like a year ago.  They played a lot of the cool shit, though.  It was cool.  They start off so good,  and then they just fade into this...  You don't even want to admit  you ever liked them.  Yeah, but you like all that shit  that he did in the 80s.  I like the Phil Collins...  You like all of it.  Here's the thing.  What's wrong with it? 
[03:09:30]  You can't hurry.  In the air tonight?  Come on.  That's a great tune.  Phil Collins...  That drum solo in In the Air Tonight?  No, no, no, but that's pre-83, 84.  Which one are you talking about?  No, his first album is the one with Susudio.  That's his first solo.  No, it isn't.  No, it's not.  Susudio.  In the Air Tonight was before that.  Yeah.  That's on that album.  No, it's not.  No, it isn't.  No, Susudio.  No Jacket Required.  That's the first Phil Collins album.  Oh, no.  In the Air Tonight came before that.  I forgot the name of the album because I haven't thought about it in fucking Phil Collins in years. 
[03:10:00]  But what was the name of this album?  Face Value.  Face Value.  Thank you, Joe.  He actually played drums.  He actually played drums when Led Zeppelin bombed on that 1985 comeback.  Oh, right.  What was that called again?  Oh, my God.  That was either Farm Aid or Live Aid or...  Fucking Robert Plant couldn't warble out anything during that.  No, they didn't rehearse.  They just went out and did it.  He still couldn't sing at all.  He couldn't fucking sing.  He couldn't hit any notes.  And he'd do the whole, like, fucking go down an octave. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, it's sad when they have to do that.  And when the high part comes on a song, he'd give the mic to the crowd.  I hate that fucking move.  Well, you know the guy can't hit the note anymore.  And it's like, you know, fucking...  Been a long time since I rock and roll.  He's singing it low like that.  Been a long time.  Been a long time.  Been a long...  And with the crowd.  Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely.  Time.  Fuck you, you cocksucker.  Sing the song like I remember it. 
[03:11:00]  Is this live?  Yeah, it sounds live.  I'm a big U2 fan.  Once they opened up with...  When the streets have no name was a good one.  That's cool.  They're still, you know, they're still doing very well.  The Phil Collins opening...  Oh, sorry.  Listen to this.  Listen to this as compared to the older version.  Dude, give the guy a break.  Fuck him!  When is this taped?  Get back! 
[03:11:30]  What happened to...  Let me get back!  Let me get back!  What happened to...  Where's he going?  9,000 shows, dude.  You can't scream like that every night.  The guy never fucking sang like the record.  Ever!  Bullshit.  Oh, what?  Song of Man's the same?  No, it's very early stuff.  Very early stuff.  Dude, you can't sing like that every night.  Back then too, dude...  Every night.  This is once in a blue moon.  They'd get together and sing.  And the guy couldn't even fucking do it.  I know, but it's not that bad.  It's like 20 years of touring, dude.  You can't sing like that.  You blow out your voice.  Dude, this is horrible.  This isn't like...  Oh, this is not bad.  It's terrible when the original...  When you compare, I understand. 
[03:12:00]  When you're going up that high as a singer, that's the whole...  That's the whole thing.  It's like, wow, the range of the singer and the voice, it's what makes it recognizable.  You sing along to it or whatever the fuck.  Listen to this.  He's not even trying.  He's not even fucking trying.  Brian Johnson's still trying.  He'll squeeze out a fucking turd if he has to, to try to hit the note.  You know what I mean?  He can hit the lonely, lonely...  But even that's...  They're tuned so far down on this.  It's retarded.  Ridiculous.  You want to hear the whole thing?  Ooh, yeah. 
[03:12:30]  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  Start singing doo-wop.  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  For Joe.  A-ding-a-dog-ding.  Rock and roll.  Roll, roll, roll, roll.  It sounds like...  In a long time.  Sounds like Bowser.  Oh, Bowser.  Have you seen the infomercial with Bowser on him?  Oh, dude, it's pathetic.  For fucking, like, CDs from the 60s or something.  And he's like, I am Bowser!  And he's this fat fucking mess. 
[03:13:00]  And he's still doing the make-a-muscle thing.  And he's got this big, fat body and little string bean arms.  Oh, that's great.  And he's trying to make a muscle.  And the mouth.  He opens the mouth and does a big double chin.  I guess they were actually edgy at one point, like, during that whole 60s movement and all  that kind of...  They used to yell on stage where he was going, uh...  I gotta...  What was the quote?  Something like it goes, I got news for all you fucking hippies.  Rock and roll will never die.  Oh, shit.  And then they go into that.  I swear to God.  On the Wikipedia page, they have some quote or something like that by him. 
[03:13:30]  But you gotta understand, like, they were playing, like, doo-wop shit in the late 60s.  That's like playing hair metal after grunge happened.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, yeah, we're still relevant.  With the hair still blown out, having the balls to go up there.  And say that their music now sucks.  Yeah.  Sean and I was playing at the Times Square Arts Center, which is also a comedy club.  They're playing there in, like, a week doing some Christmas review.  And it's clearly a case of, like, the bass player is the only guy left in the fucking band or whatever. 
[03:14:00]  And they have...  Even that washed-up cunt Bowser said no to it.  And they have a new Bowser.  They have, like, a young...  No, he does the Bowser moves.  New Bowser.  And there's a guy...  Aren't those, like, copywritten?  Yeah, exactly.  Where he does the stupid muscle and opens his mouth real big and flings his head back.  Do you remember?  I used to watch the show.  I used to watch the show.  The Sean on a Variety show.  Don't do, don't do, don't do, don't do.  Good night, sweetheart.  I hated Sean on a...  And I wanted Bowser dead.  I always hated him.  This is... 
[03:14:30]  We talked about how these bands are going to go on when all the original members are done.  They'll just continue on forever.  Yeah.  Yeah, who owns the rights to the name?  Because I was talking to Keith Robinson.  He was telling me the Temptations tour, and there's no original Temptations or something.  Wow.  I got to check on that.  It's officially no original members.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because a lot of these bands...  One of those bands.  I shouldn't say that.  You guys were talking about Journey.  We did find the new, uh, Steve Perry.  So this band goes on, and they're putting out new music, and they're done with Steve Perry.  And it sounds like the old Journey.  Listen, listen to this fucking guy. 
[03:15:00]  Just a piece.  The music is, uh, exact.  This is live or studio?  No, no.  This, I think...  This is, remember, uh, they re-released, uh...  All right, right!  The Journey's greatest hits.  They re-released...  They re-recorded all the songs with the new guy.  With the new guys, so they didn't have to pay Steve Perry any more.  Oh, wow!  Is that a fuckhole?  Listen to this.  And if you didn't know any better, you'd go, this is Steve Perry.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  I was such a cheese ball in the 80s.  I actually wished that I could fucking play this.  I'd probably air piano to this.  I didn't know any better.  Yes, a small-town girl  Living in a lonely world  Wow.  Yeah.  She took the midnight drink  That's the guy.  But we...  Dude, it sounds like it's just been updated.  It sounds like they took Steve Perry,  instead of using the 80s fucking equipment,  they're using the equipment from the 2000s. 
[03:16:00]  Dude, that guy is so good.  That guy's miserable, too.  I read a thing with him in Rolling Stone where he's like this...  He's like...  It's the worst gig ever.  He was in a Journey cover band,  and that's how they found him,  like that movie Rockstar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's like,  this is fucking miserable.  I never see my family.  I'm out on the road.  It's cool in the world.  He's in a tribute band.  Oh, fuck you.  He's in a successful tribute band.  You guys missed the one thing  that makes this really funny, though.  He sounds just like Steve Perry,  but he has a speech impediment,  and he can't...  He starts off with...  Yes!  Listen, listen.  Sounds like Voss singing it.  Listen closely.  It's the only thing he can't... 
[03:16:30]  You stink.  You have to find something wrong with the fucking guy.  But this isn't like a live concert.  They were in a studio,  and they finally said,  this is the best we're going to get  from this fucking guy.  And then they pro-tooled that fucking...  And then he does it in the second line or whatever.  Listen to the second line, too.  Sounds like Daffy Perry. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  I wonder what he gets paid. 
[03:17:30]  Now, how many of those guys get the interview?  It's like I close my eyes,  and I think it's Steven.  You know they do that shit.  Yeah.  Going out...  They probably take 95% of the gate,  which they should.  And they probably...  He's probably making 500 bucks a gig.  He probably gets paid like an NFL cheerleader.  Yeah.  He's out there on the road. 
[03:18:00]  I never see my family.  Oh, that sucks.  I'm just getting sick of it.  Yeah.  And the other one for you guys,  because everyone knows Brad Delp  decided to kill himself with a barbecue.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  Good move.  Brad Delp, the elite singer  of Boston.  He killed himself?  Oh, yeah.  Take care of the bachis  and a bag of coal.  A little over a year ago?  He was a mess at that point.  He had big dreads  that I don't think he even wanted.  I think it was from lack of showering.  He looked like a homeless guy.  And he killed himself at a barbecue?  No, with a barbecue. 
[03:18:30]  He rolled it into his...  Death by barbecue.  He rolled it into his bedroom.  He rolled it into his bedroom.  Sealed up the room,  put a note on the door  and said,  do not come in.  This suicide is delicious.  Yeah.  It smells so good.  I use colds when I kill myself.  Propane just doesn't give the sand.  Yeah, it is.  He smoke himself,  make it nice and slow.  Put a couple cedar chips in there,  you know,  in a beer can.  It gives it a nice skeet.  We got a call coming in.  Voreskin?  Or is it Foreskin?  It's Voreskin, buddy.  All right.  What's up, Bob?  Yeah, I got to tell you, 
[03:19:00]  you just ruined Journey for me.  I'm not going to be able  to listen to another song  without laughing my ass off.  With that speech impediment?  Yeah.  That's what ruined Journey?  Took that long?  By the way,  Joe DeRosa and Bill Burr,  Caroline's tonight together.  Yep.  And they're going to continue  the live programming  around 11 or so.  So live programming  all the way to three  on this channel today.  But so Brad Delp dies  and they decide  they need to continue without him.  So they found a dude  that was working at Home Depot. 
[03:19:30]  Home Depot.  Have you heard this yet?  Yeah.  Listen to this.  And listen to this guy.  Does he have a speech impediment?  Another one.  Who knows?  Yeah, he got hit with a 2x4  while he was going down aisle 5.  And proving our point,  these bands will go on  way past all the original members dying.  Because all they need now  is one hit song  with this new guy  and it's over.  Oh, we got a bad recording.  Oh.  Let's kick down.  That sounds worse  than a bad recording.  That sounds like a cell phone. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know.  I like how people do that  when they're at a concert  and they call you on their cell phone  like your cell phone  has the capability  to handle 9,000 watts of shit  coming decibels or whatever.  All the bandwidth it takes  to actually take  all that fucking spectrum of sound.  Yeah, it literally goes like,  it literally goes like,  and then they go,  can you hear that?  Dude, listen.  That's why people like,  if you were able to do that,  there'd be people  fucking grabbing cell phones 
[03:20:30]  like you're bootlegging.  Oh yeah, bootlegging a concert.  You can't fucking do that.  There could be somebody  like on the other end  of this recording it.  They know it sounds  like fucking shit.  You can't make out anything.  You can't even hear them  saying I'm at  the whatever concert.  Like it's just a  The call from the concert  sucks.  And if you're the idiot  that is making the call,  you can't hear your friend  on the other side either.  What?  No, I'm here.  You're at section 304.  You know what I always do?  I wait till the first  shitty ballad comes on  and I run into the bathroom  and I call my friend 
[03:21:00]  and I go,  dude, are you open  with Billy's gonna lose  my number?  And then I write  in the fucking easy lover.  I hate people  who fucking call.  Call during concerts.  I fucking can't stand that.  Yeah, it's the worst.  Shut up.  Calling.  Or people that search  out the set list  before they go.  I want to be surprised.  Yeah, I hate when people,  that's why I said  cover your ears.  I hate when people  tell me what they opened with.  That's my favorite part, dude.  One of the things though  is the fucking cell phone.  I mean, it's ACDC.  He's gonna moon the crowd.  There's gonna be  a lot of the standards there. 
[03:21:30]  People are gonna go  fucking crazy.  What is that?  That kid's guitar solo.  He always,  he goes fucking nuts  and then he slows it down  to get the crowd.  He goes,  dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Any solo sucks.  I can't listen to a solo  and I know you guys,  you know,  drummers and shit,  but I can't fucking listen  to a drum solo  at a concert.  Godsmack did a pretty great one.  No, Godsmack did.  It was cool.  I saw that one,  it was amazing.  Yeah, that was pretty awesome.  It was really fucking cool.  But they kind of spiced up 
[03:22:00]  the drum solo there somehow.  They were doing the Rush shit  in between.  That was fucking cool.  Yeah, it was really cool.  Tommy Lee when he had the thing  spinning around.  Tommy Lee always had a gimmick,  yeah, going on  where you would want to sit there  and watch it,  but for the most part,  the drum solo means  go out and grab your beers.  How shitty was Motley Crue?  We saw Motley Crue open  for Aerosmith.  Aerosmith killed.  Motley Crue came out.  Vince Neal looks like  Bobcat Goldthwait did  in Police Academy 2 now.  He's just all fat  and he just still has to  come out with the strippers  and you're like,  Vince, it's over. 
[03:22:30]  Stop riding the fake  motorcycle out.  It's on a track  like a Disney attraction.  Yeah, it's fucking pathetic, man.  It's really sad.  Oh, that is sad.  The worst thing I ever saw was  and I think it was  it wasn't Winger, was it?  Where the drummer did  the little drum solo.  Oh, yeah, that's a great story.  God, it was some 80s fucking  hairband reunion thing.  That didn't need to happen?  Yeah, that just didn't need to happen.  It wasn't even nostalgic yet. 
[03:23:00]  It wasn't even like a bit of  it was Warrant, right?  Oh, Warrant, right, okay.  Red Square, I think.  Warrant.  No, we saw Slaughter  at Red Square.  Oh, man.  This wasn't even  Fly Me to the Angels.  They were terrible.  That guy's awful voice.  He's a cool dude.  Yeah, but, you know,  the music sucks.  Why are you,  Getty Lee,  he's a nerd.  He's cool.  I met him.  No, I'm not, you know.  What song is this?  Who sings this song?  He was probably right.  He was really.  No, you're killing my hatred.  Yeah, probably right, though.  I don't know the,  which song is this?  I want to sing. 
[03:23:30]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  What song is it?  I don't know,  but I hope it's never played again.  Yeah, really.  What song is that?  Wait, by who?  I don't know.  Like, what song is that?  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  He does this on the show all the time,  and it sounds.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Is it a power ballad?  Yeah.  It's like Slaughter,  one of those bands.  What song is it?  Do it again, Joe?  Could you just do,  could you play that number?  It's getting worse every time.  I can't do it.  Is there any power ballads 
[03:24:00]  that really get you?  No.  Where you're like,  oh, you get the tingles,  like, oh.  Come on.  Oh, yeah,  I don't want to just say no.  Let me, hold on.  Home sweet home.  Every shock jock has his soft side.  Oh, dude.  What's the power ballad?  I love Take Me Home by Phil Collins.  It's fucking great.  Because I can't remember.  Take me home.  That song gets me like a stomachache.  Sorry.  Oh, the, the, uh,  quickly,  let me just finish with the Warren thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it was Warren. 
[03:24:30]  And, um,  it was an 80s thing  and it was before  it even became  almost nostalgia.  They were still just trying  to fucking do it  and nobody was,  was showing up at their shows.  And, uh,  the drummer goes through  a fucking run,  does his shit,  drum solo,  and throws his sticks  and you heard  plink,  the ting,  clink,  clink,  clink,  clink,  like that distinct sound  of stick hitting floor.  Clink,  the ting,  clink,  clink.  Oh, no.  He threw it over  the fucking crowd.  He missed the crowd. 
[03:25:00]  This is a band  that played arenas.  I'm not,  I'm not letting you guys  off the hook, man.  Come on.  Power ballads.  Give me one that makes it.  Home Sweet Home was great.  Home Sweet Home was a good one.  That was a huge one.  Tonight!  Tonight!  That was huge.  Come on, Joe.  What's the,  what's the Ozzy Osbourne one?  My Mom Coming Home  is a great one.  See, that's safe, too.  But, you know what?  Faith No More used to do a cover  of Easy by the Commodores,  and the way they did it,  it was more like a rock bout.  I love it. 
[03:25:30]  I still think it's awesome.  Yeah, but that's not,  what's the cheesiest song  that you can think  that you actually like?  Thank you, Bill.  I'm talking like  Every Rose Has a Thorn  or something like that.  I hated that song.  I love that song.  Now I listen to it,  and I'm like,  ugh.  I'm trying to,  yeah, it does.  I remember you,  Skid Row.  You're saying that you still like,  right?  Like Guilty Pleasure, right?  Yeah,  like a power battle  where you go,  Every Rose Has a Thorn  is on my iPod.  Yeah, it's cut up there.  Wow.  It is.  Yeah.  I downloaded it,  and then I listened to it twice,  and I'm like, ugh.  Never again.  Every once in a while,  I go back to it. 
[03:26:00]  I literally listen to it.  I can never get through  all of it without visualizing  my friends watching me  enjoying it,  and I get douche chills,  and I have to shut it up.  Like, you just start thinking,  what if I get caught  listening to this?  It's like getting caught  blowing someone.  It's the musical version of that.  Hey, dudes,  what are you doing here?  It's more of a hand job.  That's not a hand job.  It's subtly gay.  Matt Moore in Dallas  comes up with November Rain.  Yeah, yes, yes.  God, that song was  too fucking long, though.  Jesus Christ.  And it was so disappointing 
[03:26:30]  to hear that from Guns N' Roses  where they were just  this great rock band,  and then he had all these  keyboards and dizzy  and all these fucking guys.  No one of Guns N' Roses' songs  never got enough credit  was that Yesterday.  That was a great one.  Yeah, but I mean,  radio, like,  pretty much was that?  Yesterday.  There were so many things.  Nah, they had one good album.  The rest of it sucked.  You know what?  Appetite was the biggie.  Are they two?  Yeah.  I don't have two.  I only have one.  I just bought one.  I kind of like.  That started off nice.  November Rain.  That's mine. 
[03:27:00]  I don't need your Civil War.  Oh, yeah.  This is Yesterday.  Let it kick in.  Oh, I thought it was good.  You guys coming around.  Shut up.  Stop whining.  Joe, you got to get  Use Your Illusion 2.  There's so many great tracks on it.  I don't like Use Your Illusion 2,  what I heard from it.  Except for You Could Be Mine.  Locomotive's a great track.  Isn't Dustin Bones on two?  Nah, I think it's one.  It's on one.  It's on one.  Okay. 
[03:27:30]  Dude, that's another reason  why I tapped out with them.  They came out with  a quadruple fucking album.  They fucked it up.  I felt like I had a term paper to do.  That album,  if you combined the best tracks  from the two,  would have been as good as Appetite.  Could be one of the greatest albums  of all time.  Yeah, it's too much filler, though.  Absolutely right.  Pal Talk,  I got a quick one going by here.  Scorpions,  Still Loving You.  That's it.  Oh, how did that one go?  Time.  Yeah.  Maybe it's time.  Oh, you're dead?  And then you can... 
[03:28:00]  Joe, there are so many tracks  on Use Your Illusion 2  that you're missing out on.  Here we go again  all the way from the...  Dude, I just got Use Your Illusion  one, like a month ago.  Two months ago.  There's another guy  that just looked fucking odd  on stage with his fucking skullet,  his bald head,  and his long hair  next to his bald head.  Oh, and then he went with that  cruising gay guy  black leather hat  that he put on.  Jesus. 
[03:28:30]  Is that an Al Pacino movie?  Remember that?  Yeah.  Him and the fucking guy  from fucking...  What was that other band  with the bald fucking lead singer?  Midnight Oil?  No, because he had the shaved head,  so that wasn't that bad.  But it was the guy...  Oh, God,  he just recently died.  They did the cover  of the Slade song.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What are they called?  Oh, Robert Palmer?  No, he wasn't bald.  He's dead, though, too.  Slade.  They did the cover  of that Slade song.  That's a great game show question.  Bald dead guy. 
[03:29:00]  I'm just looking at...  What's the name of the Slade song?  Then I'll get this.  Yeah, I can't get that either.  Fucking A.  I'm terrible under pressure like this.  Disturbed?  Ed Asner?  No.  That guy's bald.  Come on, motherfuckers on PalTalk.  Help me out here.  I like the Disturbed.  Do you like them?  Oh, yeah.  They pull something out  once in a while  that I kind of like, but...  The first few things they did  was awesome.  They were good live.  I sold them at OzFest  a few years ago.  I used to hang with those guys  back at AF. 
[03:29:30]  No, they're not helping me.  That was one of the biggest  letdowns ever.  I finally let my friend  talk me into going to an OzFest.  He's like, come on,  Ozzy's headline.  I'm like, all right,  that'll be cool.  We get there.  Right before Korn goes on,  they're on before Ozzy.  They go, Ozzy's feeling too sick,  so Korn's going to play  an extra long set.  Oh, whoop-de-fucking-do.  They played like two extra songs.  I don't even like...  I'm not...  Nothing against Korn.  I just don't like it.  Quiet Riot, thank you.  Oh, Quiet Riot, okay.  He died?  Oh, Dubrow.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the singer.  Kevin Dubrow?  Yeah, something like that.  But he was the bald head guy. 
[03:30:00]  And he really tried.  Yeah, he really tried for a while.  And then I think he just went  with the bandana or something.  Yeah.  But with the long hair  coming out the sides.  Wow.  He went with the...  Who was that gunfighter  from the late 18th?  That was a Wild Bill Cody.  Wild Bill.  One of those guys  where you just got the total lost it,  but you got the long hair.  He went with the meathead  from All in the Family book.  Meathead.  Geez, dear.  Quiet Riot.  Yeah, I don't know  what he was doing  to camouflage there. 
[03:30:30]  No, he got some work done.  That's after the wig.  Yeah, that is a wig.  He got a hair hat.  He almost looks like  he's saying,  does it look okay?  Yeah, he's dead now.  I didn't know that.  Isn't that the guy  that sang in Deep Purple?  No.  He sang in the hair metal band.  I think everybody did, yeah.  He was in Quiet Riot.  Listen, we have to take a break  because we've got to do a live read,  so we'll continue with this.  Probably go a little late,  and then these guys  will get us to noon today.  Okay.  Rightio.  Fucking Steve Dahl  was let go today? 
[03:31:00]  No way, really?  That's what I'm hearing.  My spy's out there.  Who's that?  Backup quarterback for the Jets?  Arana Fez spy report.  Steve Dahl out in Chicago.  Wow.  This business is fucked up.  Joe DeRosa.  Bill Burr.  Tonight at Caroline's.  I'll be there.  Good deal.  Not that that's going to happen.  We're going to be drinking later.  I'm just trying to show some support for you guys.  We're going to booze up later there, Opie?  Huh, man, huh?  Nothing better than going out  and drinking with these two.  Fucking Steve Dahl is out.  Yeah?  Just hitting the wire. 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  Wow.  He only did 30 years.  Holy shit.  Well, if they could fire him.  We're so done.  How done can we be?  I mean, we're skirting around the issue,  but we're so done.  Wow.  I'm just, I don't think we make it to the new year.  Really?  Over here we will.  Yeah, yeah, we're okay.  As far as we know, we're okay here on satellite,  but the CBS situation is,  I don't know what they're going for.  What are they going to open up,  like fucking a radio museum 
[03:32:00]  where they just put velvet ropes around the equipment  at the studios all around the country  and people can walk in and see what it's like?  Just play Layla on a loop.  On a loop and just,  I think just having people come in and look,  this is a radio studio, ladies and gentlemen.  Now, if you walk through here  and just charge admission  because they have no jocks left, no nothing.  Dude, there was a Google alert.  You know, we get all the Opie and Anthony Google alerts  and there was a story out of Cleveland.  They replaced us with a format where there's no jocks.  Yes, jockless.  And they're trying to spin how that's cool. 
[03:32:30]  Can you get that?  It's cool that they're saving money.  Maybe.  Maybe that's how they're trying to spin it.  This is real cool  because it's not costing us anything.  I understand they have to put a positive spin on everything,  but how this guy was trying to do the positive spin  on a station that has no DJs,  it was unbelievable.  How long before the guy that was doing the spin is fired?  Yeah, right.  Like, do your spin and then we're going to fire you.  I've met a lot of people.  They do like it.  Now you can get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, get the fuck out.  Wow, Danny's good. 
[03:33:00]  The new voice of Radio 92.3  is an anonymous announcer outside of Cleveland.  No jocks means more music.  The changes were implemented December 1st.  Sometimes you've got to be different, he said.  Shut the fuck up, you cunt.  Just shut up with your lies,  your corporate fucking bullshit  that they think people are going to suck up hook, line, and sinker.  Go suck a dick.  Sometimes you've got to be phony, lying shill. 
[03:33:30]  Sometimes you've got to be different.  That's not good for that.  I would have loved to have seen that on CNN.  Had that guy with the spin that you guys both in two windows.  Well, you know, sometimes you've got to be different.  Shut up, you cunt.  You stupid, lying fuck.  They're all fucking corporate suit-wearing shills.  Okay.  That will just lie.  Temperature's running high out in Cleveland.  Just liars that then get their ass thrown out the door, too,  and don't realize,  hey, what's happening?  Why me? 
[03:34:00]  Shut up.  You're the patsy.  First they came for me.  I meet people a lot on the road that work in radio.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  Okay.  I just got to get through this because he continues.  We feel that that's...  Wait, wait.  Where were...  All right.  This one, right, first?  Okay, he continues.  We feel that's a better radio station for Cleveland.  And then he writes...  And then some guy argues the point and goes,  local flavor gives audiences fewer reasons to listen.  This is how he's spinning it. 
[03:34:30]  He goes, local flavor gives audiences fewer reasons to listen.  Listen, it's as impersonal as you could get,  he said about Radio 92.3.  It's also as generic as you could get.  What?  Oh, whatever.  Fuck you.  Just fuck off.  I'm sure he's on the fucking list to get his ass blown out.  Unbelievable.  All right.  All these people, everybody, everyone at CBS, have fun.  Get your resumes together.  What the fuck? 
[03:35:00]  They're going to turn it into a toy store.  Let's say hi to Pat in Massachusetts.  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  Pat.  Hi, guys.  I don't...  Hi, Pat.  I just want to say...  Who is this?  What's up, man?  On every break on BCN, they'll either read an email or talk about guys,  people listening to the station, wondering where you guys went.  And the DJs, you can hear it in their voice.  They know they're next, and they feel really bad for you guys.  Well, there was some kind of fucking rumor also. 
[03:35:30]  Some fucking blogger, or it might have even been some cheap newspaper,  was trying to start some shit and said that we said some bad stuff about Toucher and Rich.  And we never did.  And then the blogger or the newspaper person, whatever it is, their source was a message board post.  So it was some fan that was, like, saying bad shit about them because they were a fan of us  and wanted to hear us on there.  It happens.  But then they attribute it to us bad-mouthing Toucher and Rich, which is fucking ridiculous. 
[03:36:00]  You know, they're in a tough situation, too.  Everyone is that's in radio these days.  We love going after jocks, but we have nothing bad to say about those guys.  You have fun with those guys.  It's part of the stupid fuck business.  Well, in journalism, you always have to cite three sources or one message from a random listener.  Yeah, one blogger.  Or one blogger.  Yeah, on a message board or a blog.  All right, listen.  Journalism's just taking a giant moose shit.  It's just, it's not even, they don't need a source anymore. 
[03:36:30]  CNN goes to blogs now to find shit.  It's like, how reputable could they be?  They should just print their papers on moose shit.  That's what it's worth.  There's Walter Cronkite quoting from a blog that I read.  Like, you never fucking, President Kennedy is alive and well and leaving the hospital  with a mere flesh wound to his head.  Says Dickie Punchcock.  Yes, Dickie.  Read it.  Dickie Law.  Wack Bag.  Aids breath on Wack Bag says that the Tet Offensive will not do anything to the Vietnam War 
[03:37:00]  effort.  And the people on the home front will love the war.  Hey, hey, what's Dickie Punchcock?  Hey, I'm a fan of Mr. Punchcock.  Leave him alone.  Could you imagine Walter Cronkite quoting a blogger?  Some fucking person that sent something in?  Well, Bob's birth certificate might not be real, says Sissy Cuckboy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Ah, shit.  I'm trying to remember some of the horrendous...  Did you see that Seinfeld clip on Larry King? 
[03:37:30]  When I was just telling Burr about it.  Seinfeld was on Larry King.  And Larry goes, so, Jerry, you left the show, correct?  They did not cancel you?  And Seinfeld goes, is this still CNN?  I think this has been pretty well documented, Larry.  He did a bit on that, yeah.  Oh, Larry King is a dude.  What are you fucking retarded?  What are you talking about?  We haven't made fun of him in a while.  Were you canceled?  You were on your way out, weren't you?  How did the last episode do?  Did you get any ratings?  Yeah, did people watch?  Yeah.  How did that end? 
[03:38:00]  Dude, the best Larry King ever was...  Remember the skateboarder that did that ridiculous...  Like, he fell from 50 feet on the half pipe?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And Larry King had the guy on.  And what was the exact question?  How important is the board?  Swear to fuck.  He asked the skateboarder, how important is the board?  Well, without it, you're pretty much just running up a hill.  You fucking...  If I want to break my cheekbones, it's not that important. 
[03:38:30]  But if I want that not to happen, you know.  How important is the race car, AJ Foyt?  He's a fucking idiot.  How long are they going to keep him propped up in there, like, fucking weekend?  Just with inane...  I like that guy's wearing his suspenders so long, he fucking lost the meat in between  his neck and his shoulders.  Those suspenders are holding up to pins at this point.  Whatever that thing...  It just sort of sucked it down.  I picture, like...  Like, the suspenders are grown into his shoulders like a sign in a tree on the road.  Where you see a big oak tree. 
[03:39:00]  Has he eaten a signpost or something over the years?  That's what his shoulders have done to his suspenders.  Plant some kudzu on his belt.  Bad news.  Bad news, guys.  You will hear from my lawyer.  That's Dickie Punchcock.  Oh, Dickie Punchcock.  Come on.  We got problems now.  We have to do this live read.  Is that from Dickie Punchcock or is that from another blogger saying that he's going to  sue us?  Well, the Dickie's spelled a little differently, so I'm not really sure.  Denise Slug Cunt has said Dickie Punchcock. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, let's do this read and stuff and then we'll continue.  Yes, we'll continue.  And we still got to play Thunderstruck, remember.  I didn't forget.  So, quick break and then we got this.  What do we do?  Yeah.  All right.  Quick break.  Caroline's tonight.  Caroline.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are ya?  Complete social retards.  Say retard again.  Retard.  We'll retard.  Hey, you want to play all the latest video games without paying up to 60 bucks a pop

Well, we were going to leave, but we're having fun, so we're going to hang for a little longer.  Awesome.  Nice.  Then we're going to hand the ball over to you guys, and you guys run all the way to Ron and Fez.  Then Ron and Fez do their thing.  And that's how we work.  Yeah.  What primus song is this?  I actually listened to Ron and Fez.  They're great.  Oh, dude.  They're great.  Hilarious.  Hilarious show.  What primus song is this? 
[03:42:00]  Does anybody know?  Joey was right.  I don't know.  That's what I'm going to do.  Joel's the goddamn face?  It was Mr. Know-It-All.  I like them for about five years.  Everybody's coming.  Everybody's coming, man.  They rock it out.  I like these guys.  Wait, who has the big brown beaver?  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  Winona.  This one's called Mr. Know-It-All, by the way.  My name is Mud.  My name.  Not to be someone.  My name is Mud.  That's so it's been.  Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me? 
[03:42:30]  Say, baby, do you want to lay down by my side?  Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  Say, baby.  Say, baby.  Say, baby.  Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  Say, baby, do you want to lay down by my side?  Say, baby, do you want to lay down by my side?  Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  That's a great song.  No, that's not.  Yeah, that's Tommy the Cat.  Tom Waits is in it.  Tom Waits is the voice of Tommy the Cat.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Claypool plays on all the Tom Waits records now, too.  Thomas is one of those bands that are completely underrated. 
[03:43:00]  You either love him or hate him, I guess.  Yep.  But, you know, if you just know the commercial stuff, you know nothing of Primus.  Ah.  They're awesome.  You know nothing of Primus.  They're an awesome band.  Tails and the Punchbowl.  Sick fucking album.  What is that song, um, uh, something Fats that...  My Friend Fats.  My Friend Fats.  My Friend Fats is about to be a guy.  It's, no, it's new.  It was from that last EP.  Yeah.  I love the double kicks.  I think all the songs sound very similar, no?  No.  A little bit, but, you know, there's a common thread.  You know what makes me laugh, though?  Les Claypool, every time he puts out, like, a new solo thing, he'll go, I'm really pushing 
[03:43:30]  the envelope of my own musicianship on this album.  And then you push play, and it's like, boom, and you're like, oh, this sounds like Primus,  except with different people I can't tell the difference from.  Jeremy, at one point, he put out a release with a band that wasn't like, I think it was  like maybe just him and one other person from Primus, and they called themselves Sausage.  Yeah, Sausage.  And Sausage basically just sounded exactly like a new Primus album.  Sausage was the original Primus, and then it became Primus, and he went back with the 
[03:44:00]  original guys.  Back to the original guys under Sausage?  Sausage, okay.  In fact, one or two of the songs on the Sausage record became...  Look at Carson Daly over here.  Yeah, right?  Look at two.  Who, me?  I'm just saying this.  Fucking Joe, you should have seen that moment, listeners, because Bill said, fucking Carson  Daly over here, and pointed, and he pointed at Joe.  Joe then looked at the TVs behind him and went, where?  Like, not getting the joke, thinking Bill Barr was just pointing out Carson Daly on television 
[03:44:30]  or something.  I thought maybe he died or something.  He was goofing on you.  Fucking...  Oh, you know what we should tell stories about?  Was he having a yuck?  He was having a yuck on me.  Yes, a yuck at your expense.  Joe, we should trade stories about bombing on the Carson Daly show.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys ever give a watch?  Oh, my God.  When he had a show...  Is it possible to not bomb on that show?  His show in LA, though, now is good, because it's like a real studio.  But, like, dude, they used to just throw a drop cloth over the fucking SNL, like, set, and  they would just put a desk there. 
[03:45:00]  Did you ever do it when you had to...  Like, they didn't have a place for you to do stand-up.  You had to stand right next to his desk.  He would literally be like, say, Joe, like, literally a foot away.  Oh, my God.  And you'd be standing there, and there was, like, literally, like, TRL-aged kids who they  put out on folding chairs.  Yeah.  I remember one time having a great time on the show.  That's tough.  Because I heard the band laughing.  I was playing to them.  I literally told them, I go, all right, I finally did it.  I finally had a good set on Carson Daly, and it was the crickets.  I sent out a MySpace bulletin to everybody. 
[03:45:30]  I didn't get one response.  Dude, people were just like, oh, what's that?  What do you got on that?  Yeah.  All righty, then, yeah.  The second and final time I did that show was in LA, and I get there.  Hey, Joe, listen, so here's the deal.  Three odes, same audience.  And you're like, oh, that's fun, right?  And then they go, first up is Jon Favreau, and you're like, oh, great, okay.  And then this celebrity, you're like, okay, great.  So already you're like, right?  Yeah.  Then she goes, then Fiona is here.  She hasn't performed in three years. 
[03:46:00]  Nobody's seen her.  This is her comeback performance.  The whole audience is waiting to see her.  They do an entire episode devoted to Fiona Apple, and then she goes, and then you'll come  out and do your stand-up.  And I was like, yeah.  And then in the seventh hour, we're going to have someone cook a chicken.  Yeah.  And these people are just, like, fucking exhausted.  And that's my crowd for comedy, Fiona Apple.  Fucking 16-year-old girls that want to commit suicide.  Jesus Christ.  Listen, we've got to squeeze one more thing, and then we're going to give the show to these  guys until noon, until Ron and Fez, noon to three. 
[03:46:30]  Planned Parenthood gift certificates.  Jesus.  This is the story of the day.  That's how busy we were today.  We couldn't even get to the story of the day.  Listen to this.  There is another potential stocking stuffer that is causing an outcry, holiday gift certificates  from Planned Parenthood.  As you might imagine, abortion opponents are not in the holiday spirit.  The press release calls it the perfect holiday solution, one that allows you to give the gift  of life to your loved ones. 
[03:47:00]  But critics of these Planned Parenthood gift certificates say nothing could be further  from the truth.  Gift certificates and coupons are meant to increase business.  They're in the business of abortion.  So it's impossible to say that they want to do anything but drive business to their abortion  business centers.  But Planned Parenthood officials say their hope is that patients who are struggling to  cover the cost of health care will receive and use these certificates to get basic checkups  and tests.  They concede certificates could be redeemed for any service, including abortion. 
[03:47:30]  They're doing like morning zoo promos.  Dude, I would fucking airdrop these over certain neighborhoods.  I would fucking get a C-130 and throw them out the back.  That's just a great gift.  Merry Christmas, you fucking whore.  Drop it like the Joker at the end of Batman, when the money's just falling from the bucket.  They have a parade and just throw it at people.  Here's your abortion gift certificate.  You fucking, yeah, you're a slut.  This says you're a slut, and if by off chance you get pregnant, I know you're not responsible 
[03:48:00]  enough to take care of it.  So here's the thing.  Although then there's the other side, man.  It's a thought that counts.  That's finally people doing something about the population problem.  You know who could have used one of these?  The Moan.  The Moan.  Down at the abortion clinic.  They called it the perfect holiday solution, too.  You got the attitude.  Hey, Stacy, I got an abortion certificate for Christmas.  My brother gave it to me.  Well, get one of those abortions.  I won't have to sell the tickets. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Jackson Brown.  Oh, shit.  Hey, you wanted it more than I did.  All right, I take it back.  Yeah.  Can I just kick you in the guts?  Exactly.  You fucking slut.  Listen, baby, I don't got a gift certificate, but here's some steps.  You wouldn't even fuck Rhett.  We got more on the story here.  The certificates, in denominations from $25 to $100 each, are available for use at a number 
[03:49:00]  of clinics in Indiana and Illinois and a handful of others around the country.  Do you think you'd get a better abortion for $100?  Because they'd give $25 certificates and $100 certificates?  Oh, you got to get the $100 abortion.  You don't want the $25 abortion.  Jesus Christ, they'll leave an arm in there or some shit.  They got a small rug in a hangar.  What's that Stephen King book where the guy is?  Yeah, the dark half.  God damn it.  Quit getting to my references before I can get there.  Damn it.  ...of others around the country. 
[03:49:30]  Planned Parenthood offers contraception and routine medical exams and says less than 5% of  its clientele gets abortions.  Even Indiana's health commissioner has deemed the certificates a, quote,  really meaningful gift.  Planned Parenthood says in that state alone, some 800,000 people are uninsured and unable  to afford basic health services.  People are making really tough decisions about putting gas in their car and food on the table.  So we know that many women especially put health care at the bottom of their list of  things to do.  The bottom of the, an abortion at the bottom of the list. 
[03:50:00]  Oops.  I think you better put that at the top of the list.  Pretty, pretty lickety split.  Well, Craig, where'd you put that aborted baby in the hamper?  I can't.  Well, what do you think the critics are saying?  Uh, they don't like it.  But critics call the concept of giving a gift that could lead to an abortion especially  offensive at a time when millions are preparing to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.  I think they're offending, um, all Americans.  I think beyond, uh, Christians, people that don't tell her they celebrate Christmas. 
[03:50:30]  She just spoke for everybody.  She just fucking spoke for everybody in the country.  That's what they do in these groups.  300 million people she just fucking spoke for.  That's what they do with these groups.  I'll tell you what, we would have been so lucky if Mary had one of these fucking certificates.  Yeah.  Boom.  See you, Jesus.  Fuck yourself, Jesus.  There you go.  Christmas.  Merry fucking Christmas.  Like an abortion, please.  What?  She just said...  For everybody.  For every American.  This, I think this offends every American. 
[03:51:00]  She goes, excuse me, I'm not offended.  Yeah, we can't find one in the studio right now.  And you're fucking speaking for every American?  What a pompous, fucking delusional, uh, douche.  You're a sinner.  I like how you can use him.  No, I'm a sinner.  You're a sinner.  You have the devil in you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't deny it.  It's the taking of the life.  Terrible.  Did they actually kill the kid with the little...  Oh, sorry.  They killed the unborn fetus.  They gave a little paper cut with the coupon.  Oh, is that how they do it?  Yeah, they just sort of shove it up there.  Swipe it through her vagina, and hopefully the magnetic strip sucks him out. 
[03:51:30]  They should do that where...  Hope the kid was getting curious.  They should do that like when you get an abortion, it's like hiring a hitman to kill your wife.  How do you want me to do it?  I can use piano wire.  I can shoot him in the back of the skull.  He thinks he's being born.  He comes out.  Oh, no.  Like Pesci.  Oh, shit.  He's at the fucking abortion clinic instead of the hospital.  What happened today?  Did everything go good with the birth?  Eh, we had a little problem.  There's nothing we could do about it.  Your baby's gone. 
[03:52:00]  There was nothing we could do.  I thought I was being born.  Hey, you motherfuckers.  I thought I was being born.  It was just a gay guy shoving a jar up his ass.  He didn't make it, and there's nothing we can do.  And there's nothing we can do.  I love that.  Let's listen to the rest of the critics here.  I think beyond Christians, people that don't celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday are still going to be offended by this.  Because most people do not support the idea of a gift certificate for abortion. 
[03:52:30]  Planned Parenthood is no stranger to controversy this time of year.  Since the mid-90s, the organization has sold its choice-on-earth holiday cards.  A twist on the peace-on-earth message from the New Testament book of Luke.  It's a move the American lightly calls bigoted mockery.  Look, this economy is hitting every business really hard, and you have to come up with new ways of creating revenue streams.  Getting some fucking people in the door.  Getting some people in the door.  If you fucking put out abortion gift certificates, so be it. 
[03:53:00]  So be it is right.  Who are we to say what businesses can or can't put out gift certificates?  What if you have money left over from the gift certificate?  What if the abortion only costs?  Every five, you get a free one.  Yeah, do they have other things you can buy?  You just got to, all right, I guess I'll take five condoms, something there, one of those sponges.  You got to sit there and go, can I just have the $7?  No, we can't.  We got to, you got to use it at the store.  Sorry.  All right, could you scrape a little more?  Maybe you left something behind.  We got a Ron and Fez spy report coming in from Jeremy in Wyoming. 
[03:53:30]  Yes, Jeremy.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys had been paying attention.  I was flipping back and forth.  I got that best of serious here on my XM, and I was catching Bubba's show.  He's out sitting there whining because he didn't get re-signed, sitting there, you know,  talking shit about you guys.  Yeah.  Is he?  Who?  Who?  At this point, who?  Is he officially not re-signed?  Because that would be a good day for satellite radio. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, that's what he was saying, yeah.  Good.  I'd leave.  He's all pissed off because you guys don't bow down to him and Howard, and he's the number  two.  What?  He's the number two guy?  Yeah, number two as in shit.  You're nothing.  You're fucking.  He's nothing over there.  He's not respected.  I'm so done with these assholes.  He was there to fill time on a channel that was dedicated to Howard.  Yep.  And he sucks.  The drop-off between Howard and him when he comes on is astounding. 
[03:54:30]  So he's a fucking loser.  He's a fucking asshole.  It's like that Raiders of the Lost Ark where he drops the torch and it just disappears.  Yeah, it just goes away.  Spice Boy was saying he's related to Fez through marriage.  Can I be honest with you?  Hold on, hold on.  I don't know who you're talking about.  Jeremy, I swear to you, I have no idea who you're even talking to.  I've heard of Bubba the Love Sponge.  Absolutely.  Who?  It's one of them guys on Bubba's show.  Somehow he said he's related to Fez and he's going to pass a note to Fez at Christmas time. 
[03:55:00]  And the note saying it's going to be passed to Anthony and how he's going to kick your ass.  And they were just being...  Kick whose ass?  Literally or figuratively.  I thought we were supposed to be fired.  What happened?  Yeah.  Wasn't our contract...  Like two years ago we said that we had another month left.  Yeah.  What happened?  All the lies these people tell.  Shut up.  And then, you know...  Everyone's grabbing at fucking like anything they can to try to keep their head above water 
[03:55:30]  in this shit economy and the way radio's going down the toilet.  Everyone's trying their best.  Just shut up and do a stupid fucking show and try to keep your job.  Call Bubba and go, well, if you were so great, why did you never get your own channel?  We got our own channel, cunt.  Try that goddamn call screener won't let...  Of course not.  Because they're chicken shit assholes.  My brother said it perfectly.  Bubba is a cunt.  Thanks, Jeremy.  Enough. 
[03:56:00]  Why don't we get out of here?  Because now we're in a bad mood.  We could trash ourselves and believe me, a lot more people would hear than if Bubba trashed us.  There you go.  This is what we're going to do.  We got Thunderstruck by ACDC brought to you by Step Brothers, now available on DVD, Blu-ray,  high def, and PSP.  Step Brothers stars Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, rated R for crude and sexual content  and pervasive language, available in both theatrical and unrated versions.  We're going to jam Thunderstruck.  Do we have to take a break after that?  A little break? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  A little break, and then Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa are going to continue until Rod and Fez.  All right, gives us a chance to make a little set list.  Yeah, yeah.  Those little topics we're going to talk about.  Nice, yeah.  Dude, just do one set.  Do one quick, nice, uninformed set.  We're going to babble.  We should talk about the fight we had in Nashville.  Yeah, let's talk about that.  And you know how to do a radio tease.  By the way, we didn't show you our best stuff, because we know you guys are nipping at our  heels with your radio show, so.  Damn it.  We saved the A material for Monday when you're long gone. 
[03:57:00]  All right, sweet.  We're not going to show you all our tricks, you fucks.  Sweet.  Yeah, how can we steal their, what is it, find the noise, or guess the noise?  Yeah, guess the noise.  How do you steal it out?  Well, you have to watch the videos, first of all.  Pulling glass out of his asshole.  Isn't this interesting sound?  Yeah.  Pulling glass out of his asshole is something you'd want to take.  I know it.  Ugh.  Feel it.  God almighty.  I hope I never see that ever again.  I know.  That was horrible.  Ant's getting his stitches out.  And I never saw it.  I'm going to get my head stitch out.  Anthony's getting his stitches out, so hopefully back to the hat, so you don't creep anyone 
[03:57:30]  out anymore.  I really don't want to wear this fucking stupid ass bandana anymore.  You look like Meryl Streep in some role she's going to win an Oscar for.  I know.  Which is close.  I absolutely look like Chloe from Fight Club, that fucking cancer woman that was in  the, uh, what was it?  The most brutal part of that movie was when he just beats that good looking kid up.  Oh, Jared Leto.  He wanted to destroy something beautiful.  Stupid pretty guy.  Oh, Stephen S. from Bayshore wants to promote a gig.  Stephen S. from Bayshore, of course, very important to the radio show. 
[03:58:00]  His fancy radio career will be bringing him to Cove Neck, where he'll be doing a little  painting.  Wonderful.  It's getting, uh, dope.  Getting feisty.  I gotta get out of here.  I really don't.  Yeah, we do.  I got shit.  I got shit so dope.  So, uh, we're going to play Thunderstruck, and it's, uh, brought to you by Step Brothers,  the Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly comedy.  Oh, real quick, and thank you guys for having me in for the last couple days.  Always a pleasure, you guys. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, thanks, guys.  I'm looking forward to coming back and seeing your, uh, your Matthew McConaughey.  Yes.  You're going to go with him.  My nice do.  My beautiful.  Are you going to get a convertible?  Locks.  Yeah, and I'm just going to slowly run my hand through my hair.  You gotta do a parody of that shit.  Oh, I will.  Definitely.  I gotta be funny.  Have the fucking hair flowing in the wind, and yeah.  Except you're shooting your guns.  You got some good before pictures?  Jump in the pool, get up, and shake my head off.  Ha, ha, ha.  Point at a girl like a, hey.  I'm in the hot tub talking. 
[03:59:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Remake the Soul Glow commercial from, uh, coming to America.  Yeah, yeah, like Soul Glow.  Oh, that would be perfect.  Yeah, I'll do that.  You got the little Charles Bronson mustache?  Yep.  Hey, hey, hey.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We gotta go.  We gotta go.  It's my car.  Hit that record for us.  Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa will continue until noon with live programming.  All right.  See some of you at the Bill Burr show tonight at Carolinas.  Hey, let's send out a MySpace bulletin to let our 14 listeners know that we're finally  doing a live uninformed.  45 minutes getting in, getting out during this tough economy. 
[03:59:30]  That's right.  Hey, there.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks, Anthony.  Have a great weekend.  It was good to see you.  See you, brother, man.  Bye, bye, bye, bye. 
[04:00:00]  Thunder, Thunder, Thunder  I was caught in the middle of a railroad track  Thunder, underground 
[04:00:30]  And I knew there was no turning back  Thunder, my man graced  And I thought, what could I do?  Thunder, Thunder  And I knew there was no help, no help from you  Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, Thunder  Written in my heart  The thunder of guns 
[04:01:00]  Pour me apart  You've been  Thunder, Thunder  I don't know how we broke the limit  We hit the top  Westbrook, Texas  Yeah, Texas  And we had some fun

No reading, no research, just strong opinions.  Hey, what's going on?  It's Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa with our first live Uninformed in about a year. 
[04:04:30]  It's been that long.  Has it been a year?  Geez.  Danny.  Geez.  We got Danny back on the board.  It's like the old days.  It's like the good old days.  It's like the good old days, except, yeah, we're going to be filling up, what, half hour here?  Probably a little less with the break time that we have to give.  Jesus Christ.  All right, let's get right to it.  Let's get right to it.  What's up with that OJ?  Is this guy crazy?  Let's get right to it.  Our last Uninformed aired on November 22nd. 
[04:05:00]  It was taken from a prerecorded, not the whole thing, two hours of it was taken from a prerecorded  session in D.C.  The third hour was cut because Bill and I got into the two worst fights of our fucking,  in our whole friendship.  Such an epic, horrific argument.  I mean, I literally, Danny, I literally broke my headphones.  I was so fucking mad at him.  I don't doubt, I can't, well, I'm not going to say the number, but I've broken a few pairs 
[04:05:30]  of headphones over my days.  Did you do it on air as they were like recording it with some stranger just staring at you?  Well, I heard you guys had problems and I'll take responsibility and apologize on behalf  of XMDC.  Please.  It was, uh, we, we, we, we let, we let a little of the technique show that day.  We didn't keep the curtain up.  Uh, but, uh, so we, we fought, we fought, whatever.  And then we made up, right?  And we're like, all right, that was a crazy fight, but here's what we, here's what we did 
[04:06:00]  wrong or whatever.  And this is what we need to not do.  And then the following week we were in Nashville together.  Oh, Dan, you, you got, you got to hear this because like he did like 19 different things.  Like we basically been doing the uninformed to me, me and Joe have been going around trying  to hype this radio show, trying to get it off the ground.  So Joe is basically featuring for me on the road.  And, uh, you know, as a feature act, there's certain things that you, you just got a common  courtesy of the fact that somebody has to do 50 minutes to an hour after you. 
[04:06:30]  And I think pretty much right down the checklist, he broke every goddamn rule.  It was basically, it was a third show in Nashville zanies.  It was a late night crowd, right?  And it was basically in defense of Joe.  It was redneck-y.  There was, there was the big, uh, the big fat black dude, gangster rapper guy.  Yeah.  And then some college people.  Yeah.  So Joe goes up there and he starts, you know, it's a drunk ass crowd.  So Joe goes, I know I'll open with the political joke. 
[04:07:00]  I believe that.  So he opens up with some comment about the state of, of, of the political atmosphere.  Right.  And immediately, right after he does the joke, the big black dude goes, he goes, boo, right?  He booed him.  But then he sort of ducked down playfully behind his girlfriend.  So I'm like, all right, this guy's just being a knucklehead.  But Joe immediately stops the show.  He's like, are you booing me?  What are you, what are you, hand up trying to squint into the, into the, into the light?  I went right into, you, you know, Danny, when I go into my, I'm going to protect my feelings, 
[04:07:30]  you know, my character.  Oh, I know what he said.  I went right into that.  He goes, wait a minute.  He goes, are you, are you booing me?  You booing the joke or my political opinion?  That's what he says to this big thug.  And he goes, he goes, I'm booing your joke, nigga.  That's what he said, right?  So then Joe goes, uh, oh, don't call me nigger.  I'm a white person.  He takes us as a really serious dude.  And now he is just full on, just full on, just like has dug a hole.  And then people pull back. 
[04:08:00]  And then he goes, he goes, oh, what?  Is everybody pulling back?  Cause I said nigger.  And then he just kept saying it over and over again.  And then you said like, but, but wait, let me interject here for my own standing.  I w I was not saying it like calling the black dude.  I was just repeating what he said.  And I was like, and I was trying to say that I was going, I just repeat what he said to me.  That's all I'm not saying.  And then he thought the crowd got offended cause he said it.  And it was more like they were just kind of sitting there waiting for him to get to his first joke.  But Joe was in a defensive place at this point because this guy was being an asshole that Joe literally thought that, you know, that people couldn't handle him. 
[04:08:30]  Like he was being too dangerous for him.  And dude, it just fucking unraveled from there.  Yeah.  He basically ended his set while talking to some woman.  He goes, oh, you want to hear a joke?  I'll give you a joke.  And he goes, he says to somebody in the crowd, he goes, knock, knock.  And she goes, who's there?  And he goes, you're a cunt.  Right.  And then he goes to another lady and he goes, no, it was two guys though.  It was two guys.  It was two guys.  Yeah.  It was guys.  Yeah.  Okay.  Who's there?  And he goes, you're a cunt too, dude. 
[04:09:00]  And I'm standing backstage as he's nuke.  He's just bombing this whole fucking, burning the whole room down, waiting to go on.  And then he does like some sort of happy trails.  I apologize to the club and hey, so win some, you lose some.  And he fucking walks off like he's.  And then just basically puts the ball in your glove and goes, have at it.  But now here's where things went wrong.  Okay.  In fact, I was, I was genuinely upset about the way the show went.  I was mad at myself.  I was mad at the audience. 
[04:09:30]  I was just all around upset and I felt terrible and lousy about it.  Right.  So I came off stage and I turned to Bill and I was like, that wasn't my fault.  He's like, well, here's what you should have done different.  I go, you're right.  And I go, fuck.  And I was so mad, but we didn't have time to talk about it.  So he goes on stage.  Right.  While he's on stage dealing with it and in my head, legitimately, I'm like, I feel bad  and this sucks.  I get cornered by a local comedian who schools me on comedy for 45 minutes. 
[04:10:00]  But he was right, dude.  I know, but you, you know what he's skipping, Danny, Danny.  I literally went on stage.  He so burned down the room.  I bombed for eight minutes trying to get this crowd back.  And like the black dude jumped all over me because he hadn't the, just the situation  he fucking created.  Oh, and there's another thing too.  We gave him the light.  And then that situation as a comedian, if you get the light and some guy's got to do  an hour, you get off.  Joe thought it was, well, that's my five minute wrap up.  And he continued for five more minutes.  Knock, knock. 
[04:10:30]  Who's there?  You're a cunt doing this time.  Who do you think you are?  Patrice?  Yeah, I know.  Who am I?  So, so the, the point I'm getting at is, was that, um, I felt bad and, but then I get  cornered and I get lectured by this dude.  And I'm like, dude, you know, and you're, you know, when you're getting lectured and  you're going, dude, I know, I know.  I tried to take it a certain way.  It didn't work.  Leave me alone.  Like, I get it.  I get it.  And he just kept coming back to it and he wouldn't drop it.  And I'm like, dude.  So by the time he gets off stage now, you deserved a tongue lashing, but you really 
[04:11:00]  did.  That's fine.  But I'm saying a tongue lashing for 10 minutes, dude.  And from you and from you, not from the host.  You know what I'm saying?  Come on.  So by the time Bill gets off stage, I'm now in full fledged, like, fuck it mode.  I did what I did.  And that was it.  I'm tired of saying I'm sorry.  So then Bill doesn't get the apology from me that I should have given him.  He sees me talking to these chicks and just acting like I don't give a fuck.  That infuriates him.  So the next day, Danny, I get to the airport and I try to have a calm conversation with Joe 
[04:11:30]  and I literally start screaming the F word in the airport.  Like to the point, this lady with kids was telling me to be quiet.  And I'm just like, dude, you have not earned the fucking right to go on in front of somebody  and say, cunt 50.  Joe, you said cunt 52 times screaming this in the fucking Nashville airport.  So it literally escalates to this fight that Joe ends up sending me a dear John letter  the next day saying he's moving out of my apartment and he's not and he's not doing  the uninformed show anymore. 
[04:12:00]  It was class and it was classic bird to Rosa fight because it was like one of those things  where everything we were both saying, the other guy wasn't hearing it.  He was just hearing it as an insult.  Like at one point, Bill goes, we do Caroline's.  I don't want you doing all the cunt.  Fuck it.  Whatever.  And I what I was trying to say was, Bill, I know I said cunt on the other shows where  I wasn't bombing, but that was a bit I was doing about the word cunt.  And that's all I was trying to translate.  But the way it comes out is, Bill, that's just the material I'm doing right now. 
[04:12:30]  You know, that's what he said to me.  I go, Joe, you don't say cunt 52 fucking times when somebody has to go on after you.  You do that and you're going to do a fuck Jesus bit.  There goes all the women and the black people in the crowd.  They're already pulled back and I got to go on after that shit.  And then on top of that, you're ending your set.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  You're a cunt.  And then he goes.  He literally goes to me.  Listen to Danny.  He literally goes to me.  He goes, sorry.  He goes, hey, well, that's just where my act is right now.  Like he's some fucking jazz singer.  And then Bill goes, Bill goes, fuck you. 
[04:13:00]  You're off the fucking Caroline shows.  You're off the uninformed tour.  Bill, he artistically moved on to cunt.  Yeah.  That's where you're at.  I didn't know he was so offended by the word cunt.  I had no idea.  Joe, do you know the word cunt is really taboo?  I know, but we say it a lot.  We say it a lot to each other.  We say it a lot on the show.  Joe, you were saying it like you were from England.  You know how people from England can just say cunt and it's funny?  But I could see how that would alienate a crowd,  but especially a crowd that's not really familiar.  But in all fairness, the other shows that I did say it on, 
[04:13:30]  there was no groans.  People laughed.  It was fine.  Joe, no.  I'm going to tell you.  I'm going to tell you something there, youngster.  All right.  When you have to do an hour after a guy who says cunt like 15 times,  there's a certain part of the show that is over now.  Like you've turned the word cunt into like the word the.  It doesn't mean anything.  So that really, like it affects how I have to start the show.  All I had to say to you though was, Joe, could you do me a favor?  Could you keep it to under nine cunts in a 25-minute set? 
[04:14:00]  And if you said that, I would have went, sure.  Yeah, of course.  But I went to the place where like I don't have any power for some reason in my head.  I treated you like you were my dad where I just didn't say anything to the point.  I just wanted to beat the shit out of you.  Yeah.  So, so that happened, right?  And wow, we already have a caller.  That's great.  Was that, was that the show when Joe killed?  Oh, we should hear what that person says just because it's.  Well, take the, where's Danny?  Where did Danny go?  He just left the room.  Who's been fucking eating pizza and text messaging.  I like how we were pretending like Danny was listening as we were telling the story as 
[04:14:30]  he was text messaging.  Well, there's an audience now.  We have, we have callers, but listen, listen, now we want to take a caller.  We're not near the board.  We both, we went, we both, we both went to the wrong place.  I went to, I went to bravado zone and you went to your, your against me or whatever.  You know what I mean?  Powerless zone, whatever.  We had this huge fight.  You fire me from the tour.  And then that's when I went home.  I sat for a couple of days on it.  And then I sent Bill a dear John letter saying, I love you. 
[04:15:00]  And you're my friend, but I think I should move out of the apartment.  We shouldn't be uninformed anymore.  And I hope one day we can be pals again.  And this is, this, you know what this is, Danny, this is all his ego where I kicked him  off the tour.  So now he has to somehow get me back by moving out of the apartment.  So I literally called him up.  I'm like, Joe, why are you pulling a Jackie, the joke man right now?  But we're going to move out of this sweet apartment to go live up on 197th fucking street  with three roommates again.  That letter was an ego.  That letter was like, dude, you were so mad at me. 
[04:15:30]  I didn't know what to do.  I was like, I was like, I, Joe, I didn't know what to do.  Joe, when you said, I'm, well, I'm sorry, man.  That's where my act is right now.  When like, you just, he gets in his fucking, I, he's like a Wolverine.  Like he just will not back down on any fucking level.  No, I understand it because that's how I am too.  I am so, I'm very reactionary.  And like a lot of times I know what I'll do is when I'm fighting with somebody, it's  like the end all be all of everything.  It's like, I'll, and meanwhile, sometimes the other person, it's no big deal, like a  day later or two days later, but I can't let it go in the moment. 
[04:16:00]  And that's all I'll think about.  And also too, my saying, Hey, it's just for materials.  That was after 10 minutes of you saying, fuck you.  Who the fuck are you?  You're fucking nothing.  You know, dude, I didn't say you're fucking nothing.  I said, you haven't earned the right to do that yet, dude.  But the way you were speaking to me, you got it.  I mean, give me, come on, dude.  It gets to a point where you're like, I felt so disrespected that you would like, I just  didn't feel like you had any concern that I had to go on.  It was already a fucked up crowd.  And not only that, like, I just felt you made the wrong call in the beginning. 
[04:16:30]  Like I thought, Hey, is it?  Let's take one of these calls, man.  It was this guy at the show.  See what that Nashville guy says.  The Nashville guy.  Maybe he was on the.  Mark.  Mark in Nashville.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's going on, man?  I was at one of the earlier shows where Joe walks out there and within five seconds,  he's saying cunt to some drunk bitch in the audience.  Yeah, she was a cunt.  Oh, my God.  So Joe just throws it all off and poor Bill's up there.  And Nashville is the belt buckle of the Bible Belt. 
[04:17:00]  And Bill's up there doing his set.  And the crowd is just kind of laughing.  There's, I'm up on the top row and there's some douchebag just kind of going, oh, that's  not right.  The whole time.  It was a shitty crowd.  Yeah, I mean, you're actually, I mean, if it was the upper balcony, there was definitely  not an upper balcony crowd there.  But thanks for calling in, man.  Thanks for coming out to the shows down there.  But yeah, no, but Joe, like, see, like what you're saying, hey, she was a cunt.  She's being a cunt.  I'm saying like, I don't know if you're being funny right now.  Oh, as far as like, as far as like how you came up as a standup comedian, was there 
[04:17:30]  any sort of like, like, like when I came up in Boston, like you were kind of educated  as to what you, the etiquette, if you're the feature act, there's just certain things  you didn't do.  And one of them, what you didn't say cunt, because, you know, usually the headliner would  then become a cunt and toss you off.  There was no, there was no like, hey, here's what you do.  Here's what you don't do.  The way I was brought up through this was the headliner will make clear to you either 
[04:18:00]  from himself or through the club what his quote unquote rules are.  And whenever I worked with a headliner that didn't want certain things said, the club  would come to me and say, listen, this guy, you can't say this, you can't say that.  So literally, dude, if as friends, if you, I swear to you, dude, if you would have said  to me, please don't do that, I would have went, sure, dude, no problem.  I know you would have.  I assume that you had that thing.  But Joe, just to tell you, though, like in the future, if you're ever in a situation like  that, a guy has to go on after you and do an hour, like when you get the light, wrap 
[04:18:30]  it up and try to try to land the plane somewhere in the swamp, just give me a chance to crawl  out like a couple of Leonard Skinner band members.  Somehow you just you just fucking that's what pissed me off was you burn the room down and  then you walked off stage like like one of those old rat pack things like I just the  way you were talking was like you had your sport coat over your shoulder.  Like, well, I guess I just didn't know what to do at that point. 
[04:19:00]  But that's why when I came into the green room.  No, you were visibly upset.  Just do me a favor.  And if just for other guys that you're going to work with or whatever, it's just like if  you're doing that, like, you know, you're pretty much the only one.  Well, if you get the light, dude, if it's going bad like that, wrap it up.  Don't go to knock, knock.  Who's there?  You're a cunt.  Which, dude, is hilarious.  That is fucking hilarious.  If I just had to do 10 minutes after you, I wouldn't have given a shit. 
[04:19:30]  Right.  But like I had, you know, because I was already I was already like, dude, it was brutal to  watch because I didn't want to see him bomb.  And I just kept every time he should zig, he should have zagged.  And it was a bad it was it was one of those things.  I lost control of it and I didn't know what to do.  I was trying desperately through some self-deprecation and some material and some antagonistic behavior  to make it work.  And although there were moments where the situation itself was funny, obviously, it was not a good 
[04:20:00]  show and I wasn't happy about it.  Dan, it was one of the ugliest fights.  I can imagine.  It was brutal, dude.  Well, Stephen S for Bayshore says, Joe, stop being a cunt, you cunt.  And Josh, Josh in Philly brings up a good point because he's kind of he's saying that this  is kind of like what Bill did at the virus toward Philly because now this is the thing.  This is the thing about that was when I went when I was going to get off stage like I thought  Opie and Anthony were going to be mad at me.  I thought Jim, I definitely and he's right on like a certain level. 
[04:20:30]  But it was like one of those deals where it was like that was a situation that was like  see, the host went up and had a good set on the night Joe had his meltdown.  Joe went up, made a bad call, and then it fucking it unraveled.  And then like it happens to everybody.  But the Philly thing was like the first guy out of the gate gets booed.  Then a couple other guys go up.  They do OK and they're still getting booed.  And then fucking Dom Irara gets booed and they were just animals by the time they came 
[04:21:00]  out there.  But even then, that's a good point where I probably shouldn't have done that.  So maybe that was my bill.  That's a that's a decent point that he brought that up.  And I was definitely when I I thought Jim was going to be mad at me.  Like I was sitting there like what I did right there was really self because it's really  selfish what I did in Philly in a way where it's like I can't get you.  So I'm going to I'm going to you know.  But I was just I was just, you know, spontaneously angry.  But I definitely had that in the back of my head where I was like, dude, and to give 
[04:21:30]  me a little slack, it was 10,000 fucking people booing me.  What am I supposed to do, dude?  And it's like, but but I understand this was 18 people in a crowd.  And I'm sure they weren't like they weren't as as not letting it go as that Philly crowd  was like they just weren't letting any like you couldn't get in edgewise.  So I guess there is kind of a difference there.  But understand, too, in my I did feel bad.  I'm not saying I did.  But in my head, as it's happening, I'm thinking of the camp.  I'm thinking of you and Bobby and Patrice and Norton and these radio shows. 
[04:22:00]  And it's like these guys are being dicks to me.  And I'm telling them they're fucking assholes.  And like there was no there was just no thing in my head that said, fuck this show.  Fuck Bill, whatever.  It was just like, you know what I want to show.  This is the deal.  As a comedian, you did the right thing.  But as far as like the flow of the show, like, you know, that's I was talking to Keith  about it.  And Keith was like, Keith was like, would you would you have done that?  He's like, no, I definitely would have trashed a few people.  But you got to make sure like it's one of those deals where when this this host feature 
[04:22:30]  headliner, the features job.  I mean, if you go up there with material and you just blow me out of the water and make  my set hard, that's on me.  But like, you know, if you just it was just one of those things, dude, it's the third show  Saturday night.  I'm exhausted.  I don't want to fucking do it.  It's brutal.  I don't I mean, I like doing the shows, but it's like I literally just had to cover myself  with people like, OK, don't go to Bill's third show.  No, no, it was, you know, it's it's it was it was very unfortunate.  You know, it was an unfortunate thing that happened. 
[04:23:00]  It was it sucked, dude.  And when we got into that argument afterwards, man, it was like it like Joe to what, you know,  it wasn't even that you didn't do that.  You did it because everybody's done shit like that.  It was your cap.  I just felt this cavalier attitude that like I don't I just felt like a disrespect where  like if say like if Keith Bobby or somebody like that, like we're kind of peers.  We came up together and it's just like, OK, I understand.  He's got to do this, this kind of thing.  And it was kind of like, you know, right. 
[04:23:30]  But you're kind of the new guy coming into Vietnam.  But but you said when I came in the green room, I was visibly upset.  The cavalier was on stage.  It was it was the cavalier was the cold shoulder to the audience.  Right.  When it was me and you in the green room, I was like I was upset and I was like, dude,  this sucks.  And then again, you went on.  No.  And I said, Joe, you handled it.  And you said that guy was a dick.  We immediately just went to that.  What I should have said to you, Joe, was I should have said, Joe, I'm starting to get  mad here because I'm feeling like you're having a cavalier ad attitude, like you don't 
[04:24:00]  care what you what you just created out there.  And that's another thing that was different than the Philly thing was that the vibe wasn't  there.  You just made one little mistake.  You know, when you send a satellite out to Mars and if it's off by like fucking a tenth  of a degree, you missed the planet.  But it was like one of those sets where I mean, dude, like I said, we've all had those  things.  But if you know, if you said cunt a few less times, maybe I wouldn't have been.  And it was just I wouldn't have been as you would have gotten you would have gotten 
[04:24:30]  the full fledged apology had I not gotten browbeaten by the host for 45.  But then also, you know, what doesn't help matters is the owner of the club came in and  I go, sorry, he goes, who gives a shit?  It's fine.  Don't fucking cares.  And it was great.  Don't worry.  And he leave.  And then I'm like, oh, so maybe it wasn't so bad.  You know what I mean?  And I'm like, OK.  And, you know, so it's like.  No, that same person came in when they felt me out.  That one.  No, I mean the owner, the owner.  He wasn't there that night. 
[04:25:00]  Yeah, he was.  The next night.  No, he was there.  That was the.  No, Dorfman wasn't there that night.  He was.  It was the late show Saturday.  He was there Saturday night.  It was Saturday.  He said to me, he goes, you did a great job all weekend.  Don't worry about that show.  Oh, wait, wait.  That's right.  He wasn't.  Because when you started it, I go, they go.  He goes, what is Joe doing?  I go, he's trying to be Bill Hicks, the feature act as you're out there.  Can't, can't, can't, can't.  Was he upset?  He told me he he literally was like, don't.  No, but this is the deal.  They were coming to me, feeling me out to see how I felt about it. 
[04:25:30]  That was another thing, too.  I felt like what's his face?  Who brought in Johnny Depp?  Did you kind of cover me?  Thank you.  I totally covered for you.  Thank you.  It's like that other girl, you know, other girl came in.  What the fuck is Joe doing?  What's he doing?  I'm like, you know, he's having a tough set.  And then she sort of played it off.  But if I wanted to be, I could have, you know, if I, I like how, by the way, first  chance to have a live show and we're just self-indulgent, just talking to each other.  No, this isn't interesting.  We got one caller.  What are you talking about?  All right.  Yeah.  So anyway, all said and done, Bill called me after I wrote the breakup letter and said, 
[04:26:00]  please don't do this.  Let's stay together.  And, uh, we're still here together and everything's better.  That's not what I said.  I know.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  That's not what you said.  Why are you being Jackie the Jokeman right now?  Dude, I, Bill, I swear to you, dude, that was not a fuck you move.  That was like, that was like, I have pissed this guy off in a way and he is so mad at 
[04:26:30]  me.  And I don't, I don't know how we got into this position, but we're here.  And you want to talk about getting into a position.  Can we please talk about how OJ is going to go to jail, man?  I mean, I just fucking, how do you fuck that up, dude?  I don't understand how you can beat a double murder, but you steal somebody's sport coat  and you're fucking going to jail for like nine years.  He stole a sport coat?  Somebody, somebody had one of his jerseys and he broke into their super eight fucking  hotel room.  I thought it was, that's what it was, his jersey. 
[04:27:00]  I thought it was like a statue.  No, what?  He, I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  I was going to jail.  The fucking guy.  He, not just a murder, double murder.  He, that's a classic, a double fucking murder.  That's a classic case of karma.  Something in the universe was like, yeah, you got away with the murder, but here you  go.  You're well, I mean, also, I think there's a lot of white people in enforcement want to  fucking get them to, by the way, that's how you know that I'm not saying that's right  or wrong.  But what I'm saying is, is that fucking guy, you got to know that's coming down.  What the fuck are you thinking?  Maybe he's thinking, Hey, I got away with a double murder. 
[04:27:30]  What is this?  That's how you get caught again.  Grand larceny.  This is no biggie.  That's what I'm saying.  It's the arrogance of, I got away with it.  Fuck it.  All right.  Let's plug.  Oh, what are we doing?  One minute.  This is it for the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're out of time.  Jesus Christ.  I know.  It flies by.  It always does.  All right.  Real quickly, I'm going to be at Caroline's tonight with Joe DeRosa doing the rest of  the last dates on the uninformed tour until we have some more markets coming up.  And I'll be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts, February 6th and Chickopee, February  7th.  All right.
