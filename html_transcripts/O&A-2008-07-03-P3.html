<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focused on Opie's birthday.  Patty, a frequent caller, was in the studio.  The hosts immediately began teasing Patty for not acknowledging Opie's birthday, launching into sexually explicit and crude jokes about her appearance, particularly her breasts and weight.  Patty gave Opie a Starbucks gift, which further fueled their ribbing.

Following this, a large portion of the show was dedicated to playing clips from Dateline NBC's "To Catch a Predator." Opie and Anthony played several segments featuring conversations between undercover reporters and men who had arranged to meet minors for sex. The hosts and callers reacted with jokes and mockery to the men's reactions, justifications, and the graphic details of their conversations.

The show then returned to the interaction with Patty, who became visibly upset and suffered an asthma attack. Despite her distress, Opie and Anthony continued to make crude and sexually explicit jokes.  Jimmy Norton was present in the studio during this segment.

Later in the broadcast, the focus shifted to a highly critical review of a Sting performance at an XM Radio event called *Artist Confidential*.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips of Sting's performance, relentlessly mocking his lute playing, vocal delivery, and song choices.  They used vulgar language throughout this segment, comparing Sting unfavorably to artists like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan.  They also discussed their negative experience at the *Artist Confidential* event, including an incident involving a photo taken by one of the hosts that seemed to annoy Sting. Listener calls added to the show's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of the performance.  The show concluded with continued criticism of Sting before transitioning into a humorous segment guessing the themes of country songs. No guests besides listeners were present during this Sting-focused segment.

[00:06:00]  Thank you so much, my friends. 
[00:06:30]  It's great to play for you.  Thank you.  You're listening to the worst, not the best.  All of it is so bad.  All of it is so bad.  And you're listening to the worst.  It's absolutely awful.  What's Patty doing here, what's your birthday, Opie, what's your birthday, Opie, what's your birthday, Opie, when is a year ever gone by where Patty hasn't recognized your birthday? 
[00:07:00]  I bet it's something from Starbucks.  Because she'll always get you next, Opie, why no, you're going to die, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  E.T.  Bring in the needy waist.  Oh, look at how big her ass is getting.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  Hi, Braless.  Yeah, Jesus.  That's not the birthday gift I was looking for.  Nice nips.  You never wear bras, right? 
[00:07:30]  No.  No, I don't have anything to push off.  Dirty.  Don't need to cover my dirty pillows.  Is it cold in here?  Ugh.  She's just looking at you, Ope.  You look so good today on your birthday.  Her nips are hard.  Get that Paltor camera on her nips there.  Wow.  I heard you were quite a dirty girl at the party.  Yeah, filthy whore.  Stripper dick all over your glasses.  I heard Patty was quite the naughty one.  Just place it right there, E-Rock, so they get a full view. 
[00:08:00]  A gander, Ope.  A gander.  Take a gander at those birthing nipples.  Oh, wow.  They are popping out.  Those are perfect for a hungry mouth.  Oh, my God.  A hungry baby mouth.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking more maybe a hungry bear.  Disembowel her.  No.  No, of course not.  No.  Stupid.  Patty, your torso is making a cartoon face. 
[00:08:30]  I would have named a cartoon character, but I can't think of one right now.  People are threatening to cancel their PalTalk accounts.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Patty, what do you want me to do?  What did you bring, Opie?  Oh, you're a fancy person.  I know you like Starbuck.  Anthony's the fancy person.  That's for you.  I've never said I was a fancy person once on this show.  Jimmy's fancy.  I'm fancy.  Jesus, gut.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Patty, what's going on?  You've gotten a gut in the past, like, week.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  Jesus.  Like, look, you sit down.  You got a big gut.  You used to be skinny all over.  And you were in proportion because you were skinny all over.  But now your top half is skinny.  Yeah.  And your bottom half wobbles, but it don't fall down.  Which I don't understand.  Is it the menopause?  I have no idea.  I have no idea whatsoever.  Yeah.  You're collapsing onto yourself like a fucking, like a star.  But the thing is, I don't eat any more than I do.  Actually, I eat less and I walk more, so I don't understand it. 
[00:09:30]  Your metabolism is probably slowing down because of your menopause.  And you're probably getting to the point where you can't.  How many cricket wings can you bring back to the ant hole per day?  Not even one.  Yeah.  You're kind of filling out at the bottom.  I don't mean to.  Are you exercising at all?  I am.  I do a lot of walking.  I walk all the way from Midtown to the boat and then all the way through to my friend's house 
[00:10:00]  about four miles from the boat.  So, I don't understand it.  There's two free coupons in there for frappuccinos.  Coupons.  Listen.  There's two free what?  Coupons.  Coupons.  Yeah, they're for banana.  We have a new banana frappuccino.  Where the fuck are you from that you talk like that?  Staten Island.  Does everyone in Staten Island talk like that?  Because if they do, I swear it should be a nuclear test ground right now, immediately. 
[00:10:30]  Patty.  Start aerial bombing.  What is it?  Of Staten Island.  What are these?  Frappuccino coupons.  Coupons.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I don't like frappuccinos.  I know.  Oh, God.  Obi, you ripped up her.  But I do like the coffee.  Oh, I know.  Coffee's really good.  Yeah, I like it.  What is that brand?  No, I will use the coffee.  Oh, definitely.  All right.  What type are they?  One is the New Guinea coffee. 
[00:11:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm Italian.  The New Guinea coffee.  No.  But that's the name of it.  You know, I don't like the derogatory terms for Italians you're using.  That's not.  You don't have to say it's the new Italian coffee.  You don't have to say New Guinea coffee.  Well, that's what it says.  You can only drink it after you pass somebody money under your white fedora.  No.  In 1910.  Geez.  Do you have the recent Kuhn brand, too?  No.  Extra dark.  Patty's a racist. 
[00:11:30]  I am not.  It's just the name of the coffee.  What's that?  Papua.  I should have just said the Papua part.  You got any old Jew espresso?  New Guinea.  Did you blast another fucking car?  No, I didn't.  Holy shit.  I don't have it yet.  Jimmy Norton.  I cannot believe.  I don't have it yet.  I can't help it.  The cake does it.  I don't have it yet.  Patty, you smell it?  I don't have it yet.  You're at ground zero.  I don't have it yet.  I don't have it yet.  It should be wafting over any minute now.  I don't have it yet.  Oh, Patty's gut is making me happy. 
[00:12:00]  Patty, what's going on?  Lift your shirt up and let me see your gut.  Stop trying to suck your gut in.  Yeah, you can't.  Look at.  No, no, you're sucking it in.  Ew.  Let it out.  Relax, relax.  Is that a mosquito bite?  What bit you?  Relax yourself.  My cat scratched me during the night because she was rolling over.  Lift it up.  Why don't you give Obie a bun on?  You ought to put more peanut butter on it so it doesn't stray off onto your stomach.  Hey, Patty, why don't you give Obie a birthday wow?  Nah, it's okay.  Give him a birthday wow.  He's already seen it. 
[00:12:30]  I know, but it's special.  Why?  Come on, give him a birthday wow.  No, Jimmy.  No.  Come on, Patty, show those luscious cans.  He doesn't want to.  No, I don't want a wow.  Yeah, Patty.  I don't want it.  You show those lovely bosoms.  I don't.  I don't have any.  I don't want it.  I don't.  Nah.  You don't have any?  Well, Patty, you're getting better with the gifts.  I like some of them.  Thank you.  Oh, you're welcome.  I like the coffee, the frappuccinos, you know. 
[00:13:00]  You can still turn them in.  Now.  Now listen close.  Now listen close.  Here's the next thing that's going to happen.  What?  Get the fuck out.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  But I'm so tired of her.  Whenever you hear us in here broadcasting,  whether you don't hear us broadcasting,  no matter what you hear us doing,  when we're here, we're working. 
[00:13:30]  Hear that, Patty?  Yeah.  No.  That means get the fuck out of this.  What's the matter?  All right.  You can stay.  Guys, take a seat.  Pull it out, Kenny.  I feel bad for her.  Take a seat.  No.  Take a seat.  I feel bad for her.  Patty, I feel bad for you.  Aw.  Oh, God.  That sounded like something that gurgled from the La Brea tar pit.  It probably left a mark in your underwear the same tar pit stain. 
[00:14:00]  The last gasp of a stegosaurus.  Blurp.  All right, Patty.  Patty, that was very nice of you.  Okay.  It was thoughtful.  Thanks for dressing in perhaps the worst outfit a human has ever put on.  How high up do your pants go, William Frawley?  Yeah.  They don't go that high.  They're still below the belly button?  How is that possible?  Here's the problem, because she's getting chubby in the legs.  She always looks like she's wearing horse riding pants. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That's what she looks like.  She looks like a motorcycle cop.  The thing is, I don't even eat.  Shut up, chips, buddy.  Well, that's the problem.  You've got to eat during the day.  You've got to eat a lot of cake.  To keep your metabolism going, and then it'll burn the fat, because that's what it does.  Your lips are grass thin, and you still have chapped lips.  How did you do that?  Weather.  What's up with the hair, too?  What do you mean?  You're not using a good shampoo.  No, your hair is very dry. 
[00:15:00]  Are you using, like, dish soap or something?  Like, liquid dish soap?  No.  No, I use Therma Silk.  Yeah, well.  There's nothing silky about that.  It's fucking awful.  Therma Straw?  You sure it doesn't say that on the bottle?  Therma Brick.  You sure it's not Therma?  Why don't you try to moisturize a little bit, like you put some conditioner in after?  I save a little money by making my own soap.  I take some lye.  I render some fat.  Do you buy regular brand name stuff, or do you just kind of borrow of ivory for everything? 
[00:15:30]  Your head, everything.  I go to Dwayne Reed for everything.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's a great endorsement for Dwayne Reed right there.  Yeah.  Do they sell cyanide in the pharmacy section?  Oh, thank you, Anthony.  Oh, please.  I got an old please.  Step back.  Talk to the hint.  Yeah, that's looking good.  It is getting a little, um...  It's awful.  ...dumpy.  We gotta shave your head again, I think. 
[00:16:00]  No.  And you start over.  Yeah, Patty!  Oh!  No!  Yeah.  You know, when we shave...  Grab her!  Grab her!  When we shaved your head, you had a much better attitude.  Yeah, close the door, Kenny.  Yeah, close the...  Get the clippers out.  Yeah, close the door.  Get the clippers.  No.  Yep.  Yep.  No.  Time to shave your head.  No, I don't want that.  That's all right.  You'll get used to it.  It's my birthday gift.  There's the wig.  It's my birthday gift.  Get used to...  Oh, boy.  Patty...  Yeah, Patty's gonna... 
[00:16:30]  Patty's gonna open the door.  I don't want my head shaved.  Here it comes.  It's my birthday gift.  It's our...  It's Ovi's birthday gift to himself.  I don't want that.  No.  To fire it up.  You hear that, Patty?  No.  We got a wig for you.  I don't want that.  No.  Can we get a mic over there?  No.  Get a mic over there.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes, Patty.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't want that. 
[00:17:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't want that.  No.  But we do.  No, I don't.  It's my birthday gift.  But we do.  I can't.  It's a wig.  You'll look pretty in the wig.  I don't want that.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  No.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  Happy birthday, dear old bitch. 
[00:17:30]  Happy birthday to you.  No.  No.  Stop thinking of yourself, Patty.  Think of others.  You're a selfish bitch.  Your whole life is one act of you, you, you.  No.  Will you undo the cord?  We've got a wig here and everything.  She's out of reach because you didn't undo the cord.  No.  Undo the cord there, Danny.  There we go.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:18:00]  No.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  Happy birthday, dear old bitch.  No.  Happy birthday to you.  Take the hair.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  I don't want you to see it. 
[00:18:30]  No.  No.  She's crying.  Please.  Please don't.  She's begging for hair.  Please.  And her hair's awful.  Oh, B.  Is this the best present ever?  Ever.  You want to get that hair off?  Just break it like spaghetti.  Holy shit.  Look, I got to.  I can't.  I got to.  What?  What?  All right.  Calm down.  I'm getting an asthma attack.  All right.  Calm down.  There's no R in asthma. 
[00:19:00]  Patty, sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Yeah, don't upset her anymore.  Sit down.  I got to get my inhaler.  Okay.  Give it.  Let her get her inhaler.  Okay.  Let her out.  She's got to get her inhaler.  Yeah, let her get her inhaler.  She's got to get her inhaler.  Go inhale.  Don't.  I like the healthy Patty better.  She could take so much more abuse.  Fat asthmatic.  There she goes.  She's getting her inhaler.  She's struggling.  Is she okay?  Make sure she's fine.  Here she goes.  She's fine.  Doing her primatine mist.  Stupid little bird lungs closing. 
[00:19:30]  Get her back in here.  No more with the clippers.  She just did her inhaler.  Do you think she wants some cake?  Patty, get back in here.  You all right?  You did your inhaler?  Let's make sure she's okay.  She wants some cake.  Sit down.  She wants some cake.  Sit down over there.  Take a seat and relax.  Are you all right?  You took your inhaler.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  You get your asthma.  Okay.  All right.  Don't.  Let her sit.  Jackass.  You all right? 
[00:20:00]  Did you think we were going to cut your hair off?  You scared me.  I got scared when I saw that cake.  Yeah.  Cakes are scary.  Grab that cake.  Grab that cake.  All right.  All right.  Take a deep breath.  Slow breath.  Slow.  I'm okay.  Let's go to Sean.  Slow breath.  Just relax.  You're in a little coffee.  Just relax.  Let's go to Sean in New Hampshire.  Sean?  Yeah, I hope you better call Hugh and see if you can set up a broadcast from prison tomorrow  for assault in the retag.  All right.  If we kill Patty, it's going to be trouble. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I just want to say that entire thing just sounded like a rape.  She just kept saying no and she didn't like it.  She just kept screaming to you guys.  You guys just kept laughing at her.  It sounded like a Stephen King freaking movie or novel.  It was a little horrific.  Happy birthday to me.  How does the inhaler work for you?  Good?  Yeah.  It's taking effect.  Yeah.  Now you can just relax.  You're breathing?  Yeah.  You're relaxed?  Yeah.  Good.  Very good. 
[00:21:00]  Well, breathe this.  That's Opie's inhaler.  I'm between dueling, farting fucks.  It's the ice cream cake.  Doesn't it just...  It's unbelievable.  It gives you a sour stomach.  Uh-oh.  What's that?  Oh, not good.  Let's see.  Who is it?  Elo?  Well, Anthony, did I tell you that I used to get nervous when I would accept an award when  I was young?  Yes, you told me that through your ass, Jimmy.  The way it would just fart.  I would get nervous. 
[00:21:30]  Here's, uh, here's, uh, I just want to replay what Patty just, uh, said for the people that  just might have missed it.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  You are a whiny.  You do get a little whiny there, Patty.  Hi, this is Patty, known as Stalker Patty.  Well, you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:22:00]  Wow, that's hot.  This is an emergency broadcast.  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.  Hey!  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let me unzip.  Dateline Internet Predators, episode three. 
[00:22:30]  Hi, predator.  Uh, yesterday we listened to the audio of Kinky Man.  We're going to move right on today with, uh, an actor.  This guy was an actor, Ant?  Uh, well, he said he was an actor, but they questioned him on it,  and all they could really dig up was that he was an, an extra.  Yeah.  In Godzilla.  And they show it, like, they went to a clip of Godzilla, and I'm like, cool, we're going to get to see this guy.  You just see Godzilla and, like, a thousand people running.  And do they have to circle which one he was?  No, they couldn't even get that, because they couldn't even get that much out of him.  Why would they, why would they show a Godzilla clip? 
[00:23:00]  He goes, how did he go from being in a blockbuster motion picture?  They didn't say that.  To the, yeah.  And he was just kind of an extra.  He was an extra.  I think you see if Tobey Maguire walked in.  Yeah, this is, uh, the greatest show on TV.  We're hoping to have, like, ten episodes in the can.  Because, uh, the Predators are kind of on to Dateline at this point.  You gotta think, because now they're arresting him and everything.  You know something?  I think they've got to get dumber and dumber with each one, because now it's got to be all around the, if I may say, predator community.  Yes.  Is that the proper terminology? 
[00:23:30]  I don't want to offend anybody.  The predator community, uh, that this is happening.  So, uh, I can't see him really doing too many more of these and getting 50 people over the course of three days is what they arrested.  50 people over the course of three days.  I think they could do it just in every town without the cops and just lock up Predators.  I mean, any town they go in.  You kind of need the cops there to lock people up.  No, I'm saying they can lock up without the cameras so it doesn't get, you know, too.  Oh, but that's not fun.  They do that, I'm sure.  In every town, yeah.  Yeah, they do things. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know every town, but they do it.  Well, you know what I mean.  Right.  Sure.  So we listen to the actor.  He goes into the house that's a setup, obviously.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, the little fella or little girl, I don't know which one's going to be in this case.  It was a girl doing both parts.  She was the decoy, and she's very good.  Yeah.  She could sound like a little girl or a little boy.  Yeah.  And, uh...  She's well-rounded, by the way.  That's well-rounded.  Couldn't you hear the anger in her voice when she found out, this guy was in Godzilla,  and she's got to play this dumb role?  Godzilla.  Who?  Who? 
[00:24:30]  Godzilla.  Godzilla.  God damn it.  Give me a pen.  I've got to write all these down.  Who's Godzilla?  I love laughing about this later when I'm...  It's an old movie.  It's Gone with the Zilla.  We love to write them down.  Kling-clong.  Instead of Godzilla, it's Gon-Zilla.  Godzilla.  I love laughing about this stuff later, so I want to keep track.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you for many laughs in my apartment.  Store-closed Godzilla.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  Here's the actor.  He gets quite the surprise when the decoy doesn't walk out.  What's up?  Hi.  How are you?  Do you have a seat right there?  Instead, he meets me.  And remember, none of the men know they're being recorded on hidden camera.  Chris?  Yeah.  He's 34-year-old Chris Moore.  And like so many of the men I confront, he tries to lie about how old he thinks the boy is.  I thought he was 18.  He's told me.  You want to try again?  Uh, if he's young, I apologize anymore. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  You're free to go.  Do you know what would be really funny is if they guessed lower?  How old do you think he is?  Two?  Oh, shoot.  This is the greatest show on TV.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  Certainly.  Now that we got the actor crying here, huh?  What do you have to say for yourself?  I'm ashamed.  I don't know.  I just wasn't thinking right, and I feel terrified. 
[00:26:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  This is Opie meeting with E-Rock after the show.  Or if he said, how do you feel?  I wish you were younger.  Can I still bang him?  Yeah.  When all this is done, do I still get to have sex?  That's why he's really crying.  You mean I don't get the young ass?  I feel terrible.  This wasn't seriously the first time, and I knew I was taking a huge risk. 
[00:26:30]  So you knew what you were doing was wrong?  Yeah.  It becomes a tearful performance for an actor who says he's played many roles.  I've worked in background movies.  He was in television.  And what do you do for movies and television?  Background standing work.  Last comic.  Like as Andrew?  Yeah.  I played Lenny Bruce once.  What would I have seen you in?  I've never been kissed. 
[00:27:00]  Pearl Harbor.  Dead Zero.  How did he get from being a stand-in on blockbuster movies to standing in our kitchen?  Why did you do it then?  Tell me what was going on in your mind.  I don't know.  You know how people will react when they see this.  I mean, this does not look good.  You think?  I tried to do the right thing, but I'm weak. 
[00:27:30]  I'm too fucking weak.  You hear how that guy's crying?  Every girl that leaves his house walks out with that same basic crying.  Mommy, what did I do?  He's actually a method actor, and he's working on a film called The Memory Repressor.  He was in Pearl Harbor as an extra, I guess.  An extra in Pearl Harbor.  There were a million extras in that.  I was the guy that was running away from the blast. 
[00:28:00]  I'm the guy who did this, and he throws his arms up and runs in a circle.  I'm the guy that grabbed a little boy when the bomb went off.  Yes, a little Hawaiian child.  And I hit him in my underpants.  He said, like, how do you get into these movies?  How?  He signed his name.  That's how we got in.  Yeah.  All right.  We move on.  Well, you know what?  It's funny.  He's an extra, so I guess he's used to five and under.  That's a good line.  That's a good industry line.  Oh, but it's so inside.  Yeah.  That's a good industry line, man.  Someone's driving right now. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  That Jim.  He's an insider.  Some guy in Hollywood Hills laughing and laughing.  Da-da-da.  Ha-ha.  And all of Alabama going, what the fuck?  Oh, no.  How about all of America, except for two guys in la-la land, as I call it?  Ha-ha.  I'm kidding, boys.  Dateline, Internet Predators, Episode 3.  We meet biotech musician.  And it doesn't look good for this next guy, either.  He's 56-year-old Stephen Coates, who goes by the screen name M4 Pixeline. 
[00:29:00]  He works in the biotech industry and is a songwriter on the side.  He even has a website where he sells his work.  A songwriter on the side.  A songwriter on the side.  That's great.  What song is this guy?  What work on?  When I'm lying here in bed, I find it hard to believe that you're seven.  She was just nine.  You know what I mean.  Three candles.  Thank you, Yoshi. 
[00:29:30]  Very similar to a Yoshi joke.  Oh, wait.  That's good.  Let him come.  Here they just.  Let him roll.  Too heinous.  Is that too heinous?  No.  No. 
[00:30:00]  What are you kidding?  Everything's fair game on this show.  This is almost so wide open, I'm like mentally salivating and coming up with nothing.  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  Damn songwriter.  This clip's great.  He's requesting anal.  Is this the songwriter?  Yeah.  It doesn't get much better than this.  He goes on to explain to the girl he thinks is a 13-year-old virgin that they should have  oral sex because intercourse is a big step.  And he adds, sometimes people just do anal sex first. 
[00:30:30]  Sometimes.  He's just filling her mind.  Hey, you know, if you're a virgin, sometimes they just do the anal first.  Are you kidding me?  He's trying to show he's a nice guy.  Like, hey, look, that's personal.  I'll just put it in your shitter than your mouth.  You'll take your virginity away from you.  You won't sit down until you're 18.  You should really save that for someone special.  I'll just fuck your ass.  I can't do anal, sir.  All right, put this mud in your pussy.  Everyone knows that's the wedding hole.  You're a special girl. 
[00:31:00]  We're going to save that.  Then you're still a virgin.  And then he starts asking about her body.  How tall is she?  How big are her breasts?  And one of the most frequently asked questions, if she has hair in private places.  When the decoy says, not really, the 56-year-old says, that's terribly sexy.  He raises a good point.  Well, I just prefer to have been shaved as opposed to not having showed up yet. 
[00:31:30]  I want to fuck your ass.  I want to fuck your ass.  Oh, she's three.  Oh, she's three.  She had no pubic hair.  Yesterday, you were only seven.  They just are the worst. 
[00:32:00]  I'm not the one doing it.  I'm just singing about it.  He's the songwriter.  I'm setting your examples.  I don't mind that you're doing it.  He's the songwriter.  All right, here we go.  Another clip from biotech musician.  He tells her he's trying to be discreet so his wife and son don't find out.  And here he is, coming in the door.  What's in the bag?  Oh, nothing really.  It appears our songwriter has brought along some of his own work. 
[00:32:30]  But he quickly realizes he won't be playing it for a child.  Good evening.  How are you?  Oh, okay.  Why don't you have a seat on the stool there, please?  Yeah, I get in the fuck up first.  The tune will be singing a different tune.  Ah, singing a different tune.  This reporter is the fucking worst.  Smarmy.  Oh, my God.  Should he be beaten?  I hope he gets busted in a sting of some sort.  Oh, would that be great?  Let's go to...  I'm walking in this house to find a 13-year-old. 
[00:33:00]  I'm going to scar you emotionally.  Let's go to Dr. D.  Dr. D.  Well, I'm ass-raping this girl in Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What happened he's there?  He's doing Springsteen.  Girl, you'll be a woman in 15 years.  Will you still need me?  Will you still feed me? 
[00:33:30]  Since you're only four.  My girl's only nine.  Mop, mop.  Let's go to Anthony in Yonkers.  Anthony.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I got a little title for you.  How about six little candles? 
[00:34:00]  Wasn't that done already?  Of course it was, but with less candles.  You non-paying attention ass.  Let's go to Seth.  Doubling my candles.  Seth in Boston.  Hey, it's Seth in Boston.  What's up?  How about Benny Mardone?  She's just 13 years old.  Leave her alone, they said.  Way to deliver it.  Wow.  Sorry.  Like a court transcript.  Yeah.  Let's go to Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo?  Ha-ha, Magoo.  How you doing, Bruce?  The cherry's gonna pop. 
[00:34:30]  Diddy-bop.  I heard cherry's gonna pop.  Diddy-bop.  Not bad.  One last clip from Biotech Musician.  I want to see what's in your pocket.  Oh, it's just this CD.  Of what?  May I see it?  This is the songs I have.  Songs?  Yes.  And what are you doing?  Oh.  He brought a CD of his songs.  Of his songs.  That's gonna woo her.  He made a CD for her.  This is a song called Keep This Between Us or I'll Kill the Dog. 
[00:35:00]  Mr. Can you please play If I Don't Suck It, I Won't See Tomorrow?  Let's go to Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff?  Yeah.  She's only two or three.  I'm a winger.  Very good, Jeff.  All right.  And what are you doing here, Stephen?  Um, I was doing something that I shouldn't be. 
[00:35:30]  And what is that?  Why don't you tell me?  Writing songs.  I just want to go, okay?  Please.  What are you doing here trying to meet a girl who told you she was 13 years old, Stephen?  I've never done such a thing and I didn't want to do it.  Why did you do it then?  Because I just, I'm stupid.  I'm absolutely, utterly, completely stupid.  Well, they called it puppy love, even though I'm 33.  Put your head down in your crib. 
[00:36:00]  Burp you over my shoulder.  Ooh, it's raining, kids.  Hallelujah, it's raining, kids.  Puggle rapist.  Puggle rapist.  Stand by your three-year-old.  Give her a cock.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  That's got to get completely graphic.  Yeah, we're trying to keep it right on the edge.  Jesus.  To all the girls I have a love to are for.  Let's go to Will in Boston.  Will.  Hey, you don't even have to change the words.  Love hurts.  By Nazareth.  All right.  Want to move on to the next guy?  How do none of these guys walk out with Lisa Peach in her hand to cover him, you know?  Any delivery?  All right, so what the fuck?  One bad one out of seven so far.  I thought you were serious. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, no, they just want you up.  But they have transcripts of their...  Yeah, photos.  Well, right there you're arrested from the transcripts.  All right, let's go to...  When a man loves an infant.  Ooh, baby, baby.  All right, let's go on to South Bay Guy.  South Bay Guy.  This guy got busted by perv justice before?  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Didn't learn.  Here comes South Bay Guy 310.  A year ago, he was caught talking to a perverted justice volunteer who was posing as a 12-year-old.  His name and other personal information were posted once before on perverted justice's website,  which usually means his employer, family, and neighbors were contacted by perverted justice members  and directed to his sexually charged chat log.  But it seems he didn't get the message.  Here he is back online with the same screen name, South Bay Guy 310. 
[00:38:00]  Three minutes into the chat, he asks the girl if she's a virgin.  Then he wants to know if she's ever had sex with a guy from online before.  The girl says, yeah.  And so he asks, do you want to meet and see what's up?  That all happens in less than eight minutes from the start of the chat.  And as you'll hear, it gets more disgusting.  Can I videotape us?  Are you, like, going to sell it?  No.  LOL. 
[00:38:30]  I don't go to camp, though.  I want to watch it and masturbate to it.  Jesus.  I want to watch it and...  Oh, crap.  South Bay 310, he likes it.  That's his numbers.  Between 3 and 10.  Yeah.  South Bay 309 is an upstanding citizen.  South Bay 310 will fuck anything.  Just as he pulls up, that's him driving by, there's another man being arrested outside.  Yeah, get this.  He calls the decoy to find out what's going on. 
[00:39:00]  Del quickly makes up a story saying her neighbor was arrested for dealing drugs.  Amazingly, the police activity isn't enough to stop him.  That's him coming in the door.  32-year-old Keith Williams.  He's got the alcohol and the camera.  He doesn't seem all that surprised to see me.  You know what?  I know.  Sit down, please.  Okay.  Please sit down.  Relax.  Actually, I'm not relaxed.  I'm not going to give an interview. 
[00:39:30]  You're not going to give an interview?  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't think it's in my best interest.  But he proceeds to give the interview.  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  I'm stupid.  I knew it better when I drove by.  I just knew it better.  Why did you do it anyway?  I wasn't going to.  I don't know.  I just bored.  Because I enjoy having sex with young girls.  I just.  So you're bored?  You're going to come over and try and have sex with a 13-year-old girl? 
[00:40:00]  No.  Like a man?  Yeah.  Jotting that down.  I don't know what I was going to do.  But in his chat, he makes what he was going to do pretty clear.  You want to take pictures of her.  Take naked pictures of her.  Oh, dude, I don't know.  I'm not denying anything I said.  It's all right there.  Did you ever hear of a group called Perverted Justice?  Yes, I have.  I know about that.  I'm not sure I know how old they are.  They were posted here after talking to a girl who said she was 12.  Oh, God.  And you know it's not their first time. 
[00:40:30]  No.  They've had it done it five, ten times already.  65, seven-year-old man walking in.  They're just that disgusting.  Voss, you've got a couple daughters.  How do you protect them from this type of thing?  Well, they can't read, so they don't go online.  Do you watch their activity online?  No, but they're not allowed to go into chat rooms, you know.  Oh, yeah, but you know what?  I know parents that say the same crap, but then their kids are still in the rooms.  And this is what's going on in schools these days that, you know, the kids get home from 
[00:41:00]  school and they're just on AOL or what have you, IMing like crazy, you know, all their  friends all over the place.  It's just, you know what it is.  You can't really police it.  And a kid that just goes to school with a skirt, whatever, you know, trying to be in  fashion, some fucking predators went dream, you know what I mean?  It's just, anywhere they go, I mean, you know, you try to protect them, you know, you just  say you can't go into chat rooms, you know, you can't talk to strangers, no black kids.  You just try to get as much. 
[00:41:30]  I think, Mike, you know what it is?  I don't know.  Just the fact that you said she goes to school with a skirt because she wants to be in  fashion shows what an old man you are.  Yeah.  She wants to be in fashion.  Yeah, yeah, no.  No one says that.  Send them in a gunny sack.  In fashion.  You send your kids to school in gunny sacks.  I can't wait to have kids.  I'll put her in a miniskirt.  Why not?  Let her learn for herself.  Toughen up, baby.  Hi, this is Louis Black.  You're listening to...  Fuck.  This is Louis Black. 
[00:42:00]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst black of Opie and Anthony.  This shit sucks.  It's awful.  Let's go back to the Dateline Internet Predators episode three audio.  We're in the middle of listening to South Bay Guy.  When we left him, where were we at?  I assume he wants to fuck a kid.  Well, there you go.  And he's seen...  He was busted by perverted justice before, and he admits in this clip that he even has seen the Dateline special before. 
[00:42:30]  So as soon as that guy walked out, he's like, uh-oh.  I think he also just said that he, uh, the cops were outside right when he was pulling up.  Did that just happen?  Yeah.  He's the guy that saw cops busting the guy before him and still went in the house because the decoy said,  oh, no, that's my neighbor.  Because he was so worked up.  He didn't want to believe that this was a setup.  He was so worked up in his head in a lather. 
[00:43:00]  A lather?  I need that cock!  What would have happened if I wasn't here, Keith?  You show up with booze.  Well, I'd be fucking the girl that I was chatting with.  You fucking cockblock?  Yeah.  If I hadn't cockblocked you...  That guy really is awful.  What would have happened if I wasn't here, Keith?  You show up with booze.  What else you got?  That's all it is.  Just booze.  You got booze.  You know, I don't know.  You're going to booze up a 13-year-old girl.  You can hammer me where you want. 
[00:43:30]  I'm telling you, I am wrong.  You got to listen to me.  I'm wrong.  This guy's great.  Bottom line, I'm wrong.  It's not your first time down this road.  Lawyers are cringing right now.  You ever watch Dateline NBC?  I've seen that episode, actually, and that's why I just...  I don't prefer to be on camera.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Well, we'll adhere to your wishes...  Sure, why not?  ...by shoving three of them in your face right now.  You saw the earlier episode.  Yes, I did.  So, let me get this straight.  You saw our earlier story.  Right.  You drove by this house and saw police out front.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Yet, you walked in here anyway.  Bored.  Like I told you.  Bored.  Bored.  I'm bored of not having sex with children.  I'm bored.  God, enjoy the gym.  I don't know.  I need a hobby.  Come here, kid.  Maybe he meant, I want a girl with a shape like a board.  I got to hear that again.  He's bored.  I'm bored.  Bored?  Yes.  Bored?  Because whatever you'd like to say, we'd love to hear it. 
[00:44:30]  But obviously, we can't keep it here and you're free to go whenever you want.  Absolutely.  Well, what I'm going to tell you is, is that I'm never going to do this again on everything  I love in life.  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to get rid of my computer.  But you came here.  I understand that.  But that's wrong.  I don't think the war, you talked to the girl.  Well, I didn't.  Okay.  How is he going to get rid of his computer, by the way, one of these guys?  Yeah, believe me, the police will take care of the computer.  He's going to make a deal with NASA and get it on the next space shuttle mission.  Going to get rid of it. 
[00:45:00]  Do you have a vat of computer-dissolving acid?  Right.  I'm never going to do this again.  He's going to throw it into a volcano.  They're all getting fucking reamed in prison now.  It'll be funny if, as he's leaving, he goes, by the way, is she here?  Yeah.  Can I at least get a look at her?  Can I just say hi?  Let's go to Dan in Sacramento.  Dan!  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Dan.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  I wanted to ask Opie if... 
[00:45:30]  Right.  If...  What are you going to go meet his girlfriend for the first time?  Was he afraid he'd bump into a date letter reporter?  All right.  Easy.  The first time he went over the house.  Hi, Opie.  This is a popular radio show host.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Opie, what were you thinking when you came here?  Easy.  I just...  I just...  All right.  Here we go.  Girl.  I didn't...  Okay. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know what I can...  What would have...  But you got to want something to risk...  Holy shit.  Great observation on how to stop the tape.  Listen to this.  Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne, what's up?  I just wanted to say the guy talking right now sounds just like Bob Kelly.  Oh.  Listen to this.  She's so right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got to go backwards a little bit here.  Give it a little time.  Dude.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's see if Corinne's right.  I just wanted to hold my hand.  Hold my rattle.  He says that I'm never going to do this again on everything I love in life.  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to get rid of my computer. 
[00:46:30]  But you came here.  I understand that.  You walked into the ward.  You talked to the girl.  I didn't...  Okay.  I don't know what I can...  What would have happened.  But you got to want something to risk coming in here after seeing police.  I just thought she might have been sure about something next to her.  I was like, yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe it's...  Honestly, I don't know.  Now when I walk out, am I going to be arrested?  That's not up to me.  It's up to the 15 cops outside waiting to arrest you. 
[00:47:00]  It depends how fast you can run.  Which way are you going to go?  Right.  I would talk for as long as possible in that kitchen.  Yeah.  Can I get a Diet Coke, baby?  Well...  Wait until the Statute of Limitations runs out.  Yeah.  Seven years we've been talking.  We've got Pete Townsend on the line from Great Britain.  Pete?  All right, mate.  If he's going to throw that computer away, I'll play it.  You know what I'm saying about the rough boys there, mate.  Pete Townsend.  My friend Gary Glitter's over here as well.  He's got a little tune. 
[00:47:30]  He wants to play on the Little Life Meat Clue.  A meat floof.  All right, Pete.  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Eight!  Da-na-na-na-na.  All right.  Who are you?  Wait, there's a pile-up cop arrested?  What's this clip about?  I don't know.  It continues the story.  South Bay guy.  Inside, Jazzman 04 decides to cut our conversation short.  You need to run?  I need to.  No, no, no.  Well, I'm sorry.  And makes a run for it. 
[00:48:00]  The detectives spring into action, arresting the man sitting in his car across the street,  then Jazzman 04, and then the man parked on the side street.  This all happens less than six minutes from the time the first car pulls up.  This was interesting.  As for that man who sat in his car while another man walked in the house, guess what he does  for a living?  You want a criminal investigator?  A federal agent working for the Department of Homeland Security.  Active duty Homeland Security. 
[00:48:30]  There could be a terrorist in that pink little butt.  He just had to work that out.  He's looking for Al Kitta.  He wants to make sure he gets blown.  No, no.  Well, you know.  That was an interesting segment because three guys pull up at the same time. 
[00:49:00]  Three guys.  She was a whore.  One goes into the house.  Yeah.  This little slut.  And two guys are kind of sitting in their cars, just kind of watching the whole thing  unfold, but not leaving.  Still, again, thinking, this might work out for me.  This could be just something else.  Maybe they're filming a movie.  And they just sat there in the car watching, and the cops sprung into action, arrested them.  Well, there's an extra here I recognize.  They might be filming a movie.  Yeah, right.  This wasn't the one you were in Godzilla? 
[00:49:30]  Well, so now we have the Homeland Security guys in the house.  This is more on him now, I think.  We're moving on.  He actually, he just gets arrested.  I think he just runs.  And so this is him.  Never makes it.  Yeah, but he cops a big plea.  This is him talking to the cops.  Yeah.  And remember the federal agent?  He can't seem to stop talking to the cops.  My father was a police officer.  I was a police officer.  I worked for Department of Homeland Security.  Okay.  I understand you guys have a job to do, and I'm not trying to tell you anything else other  than that.  I swear to God, as God is my witness, I'm aware of St. Michael's Medal right now. 
[00:50:00]  Okay.  I was not going to do anything with her.  But the detective doesn't seem to be buying his story.  But I'm telling you, I don't believe it that you didn't intend to have sex at some point  with this, sir.  I swear to God, sir, I was not.  It would have happened.  Sir, I swear to God it was not.  I guarantee you, it would have happened.  And he's got one more thing to say to the disgraced federal agent.  And in your position, you should know better.  That's right.  You know the law.  That's even worse. 
[00:50:30]  You know what?  That puts a bad mark on my job, on everybody.  Every cop in this country, you put a bad mark on them.  I know, sir.  You think a PBA card could get you out of this?  That might have worked if he just would have pulled the PBA out a little inconspicuously  and said, hey, that's an association.  My father was a kid toucher.  I'm a kid toucher.  My father was once a kid.  I was once a kid.  You know what?  That's how you know you're in trouble when one cop is calling another cop, sir. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  When a guy from Homeland Security is calling a local detective, sir.  Turn it right around on him.  Good point, sir.  Oh, yeah?  Where were you?  September 11th, sir.  Hey, whoa, hey.  Hey, hey, I'm Homeland Security.  Where were you?  That's right.  What's your last name?  Let's go to Doug.  Sounds Saudi Arabian.  I'm checking her animals.  Doug in Minnesota.  Doug?  I want to pop your can.  That song is still coming in.  All right.  Now we got two guys coming in at once. 
[00:51:30]  What was this one about?  Anyone?  I didn't see the show, unfortunately.  This was just two sort of younger gentlemen, but obviously too old.  Wait, Voss.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  What?  No, I was giving you an idea.  What's that?  Nothing.  I was just saying, you know.  Voss, just say it.  You know, when they're interviewing these guys, one of them break out to the guy, like  the guy in The Godfather.  She had the best pussy in town.  You know what I'm talking about when he was talking about Meryl Monroe?  Yeah, I got the clip right here. 
[00:52:00]  See?  He does him.  Hey, it's Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  Idiot.  Idiot.  Hey, it's Voss.  Boring.  Today, Junior.  I actually like the delivery.  I love the rhythm.  Oh, you leaned over and whispered it.  I'm like, don't fucking put that one on me.  It's because it's funny that you didn't know the guy's name.  The guy from The Godfather. 
[00:52:30]  It's Jack Waltz.  I'm the Godfather.  The best pussy in town.  If the quote wrong.  No one said that, Rich.  Hey, what was the quote again?  I don't know.  You like, she was the best piece of ass in town.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  It was just like how you said it.  Now you get the hell out of this kitchen.  This fits you.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:53:00]  Slobber.  All right, here we go.  Look ridiculous.  Two guys come in at once.  He was banging elementary school students two at a time.  Well, you know, interesting side note, guys.  But in the book, and in the original film it was shot, Jack Waltz,  was giving a girl who was 13 a pony, or she was 12.  Yes.  And then when Tom Hagen's leaving, he looks up, and he sees the mother pushing the girl  back in the bedroom.  The girl's crying.  So you have to realize that he got her a pony and then fucked her when she was 12. 
[00:53:30]  For some reason, they took that out.  The hot factor.  And we're here at his production studios.  Jack Waltz.  You phony, talking son of a bitch!  Let's get a mic in Jersey.  Mike, thanks for calling the program.  Hey, guys, I got a song.  Goo, goo, goo, goo.  Ga, ga, ga, ga.  That's all she ever says to me.  The police.  That's really good.  I'm sorry.  You're out, Mike.  I like it.  Maybe I could help.  All right, we're almost done here, because we've got to move on to Steve Martin.  We're not done with this. 
[00:54:00]  We'll have to pick this up tomorrow.  You're saying that we're going to give a little bit more in the installation.  Yes, that's radio talk.  Going to go to something more offensive than kid-touching Steve Martin in that Pink Panther movie.  That's right, from the pink pussy to the pink panther.  Jesus.  Two guys, come in at once.  Listen to this.  This is 20-year-old Sebastian Rodriguez, here after chatting online about sex with a decoy posing as a 12-year-old girl.  He's brought along a friend.  What are you guys up to?  Nothing.  Nothing.  We just came to hang out. 
[00:54:30]  Sebastian also brought condoms and Mike's Hard Lemonade, just what the decoy asked for.  What did your buddy Sebastian here tell you about what was going to go on here tonight?  Really nothing.  I just came along.  It was just a tag along.  Just a tag along.  I really didn't plan on doing anything, sir.  I was just going to come over here.  You got Mike's Hard Lemonade.  And Mike's Hard Cock.  Sounds like you were planning to have sex with this girl.  I'm not, sir.  But why would you bring this to us, sir?  I don't know, sir. 
[00:55:00]  How does that look?  I know, sir.  I'm so sorry.  I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go to jail.  When Sebastian and his friend leave, it appears they think they're off the hook.  Great.  Thanks a lot, sir.  But not for long.  Oops.  Don't go outside.  Bruce in Jersey.  Hey, I got a song for you.  All right.  Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?  Did he go and leave you all alone? 
[00:55:30]  Oh, no.  I got a strange desire.  Oh, fuck.  It's that reporter again.  All right.  You know, let's play two more clips.  Because Six Pack, So Cali, this is a good one, too.  Yeah.  Southern Cali, asking, offers him a paper towel.  Do you remember this one?  Uh, yeah.  Listen to this.  Here comes the man who calls himself Six Pack So Cali. 
[00:56:00]  He's 26-year-old Christopher Urban.  What?  I gotta wash my hands, folks.  Okay.  Paper towels are over here.  Oh, thank you.  He's here after making plans for sex with a 13-year-old girl named Kelly.  That's way watered down.  Way watered down.  He's brought along Bacardi rum.  You came to see Kelly?  Yeah.  And how old is Kelly?  Kelly's way too young for me.  Way too young for you?  Yeah.  Then why did you come here, Chris? 
[00:56:30]  I came here to tell her that, actually.  To tell her that she was way too young?  Actually, I did tell her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a child molester, and he's cheap.  He's watering down the liquor.  She's like, you know what?  I can fuck anybody on the block.  He's gonna bring me good liquor.  The best part of that clip, though, he's washing his hands, and then the Dateline guy  hands him a paper towel.  And he goes, thank you.  And he goes, oh, thank you.  This is how they should play it.  You gotta learn how to lie.  Be the reporter.  Ask me how old I think she is.  How old did you think she was? 
[00:57:00]  A hundred.  Days.  Days old.  All right, here's the last clip for today.  That's what he says now.  But when he was online, six-pack SoCali not only had a sexually disgusting chat, he also  turned on his webcam and sent photos of himself naked.  Close-ups we can't show you.  Why?  Did you transmit this to the photo? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, goodness gracious.  He's very proud of his photo, it looks like.  Is that wart on your cock ears?  Hey, that Viagra works great.  Oh, my.  Ah, for the love of Eve.  Oh, my.  Transmit this photo here.  Oh, my.  I sent...  I didn't know I sent that one.  You didn't know.  That one?  Well, actually, yeah, I did, but...  On the right.  Wow. 
[00:58:00]  To a 13-year-old girl.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  You're right.  I know.  I wasn't thinking.  And that's what, you know, even coming down here.  I mean, look at me.  I didn't even take a shower.  If I was someone doing something like that, I would have taken a shower.  You know?  I mean, that's the first thing you do.  I mean, look at me.  I'm so dirty.  Like, I know.  Well, I'll tell you what's dirty is this conversation you had.  Yeah, I know.  It was the first time we'd heard the I didn't take a shower defense.  You won't be taking it when you're going either.  You can try telling that to the cops.  Take a shower like American History X.  Take a shower. 
[00:58:30]  Look, smile.  My balls.  They're oniony.  I never would have let a child lick these.  That's a very convincing argument, sir.  Yeah, like he's a bastard enough to go in there to try to have sex with a kid.  But he's good enough to have showered before.  Sir, I watered down the liquor and my balls are dirty.  What am I, a cad?  I just came to tell this child, you're too young for me to fuck.  A charlatan?  Yes.  What do you think I am, a Svengali?  Does this fucking broad ever stop dancing? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, Ellen, I just want her to break her legs.  Hey, fuck it, I hope she...  Nah, I'm leaving you go.  What?  What do you hope?  Nah, I didn't...  What?  What do you hope?  No.  But when I saw a cop out on 34th and Vine, I got into some trouble cause I love pussy under nine.  That was Greg from Chicago.  I just ripped him off.  But you knew you could do a better job.  Thank God you went with that.  Yeah.  Because if it was too good, he would have been all over the place for that. 
[00:59:30]  Thank you, Greg from Chicago gets full credit.  Hi, this is Jill Michelini, and when I'm not talking about the traffic, I'm talking with  Anthony from the Opie and Anthony Show, all about the things we have in common.  We're both from Long Island, we both love texting constantly all morning at work, we both love  to drink, shoot guns, that's about it.  Oh, oh no, we both love children.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, to finish up on a discussion we had, I think it was about a week ago now.  Ah.  Got a little music for everybody today.  Come again, sweet laughter from now and bite, thy graces that we've heard, to do need  you delight, to see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die, to die. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, what, oh.  This is why we're not getting a police reunion tour anytime soon, because Sting is now playing  the loot.  He's too busy with this drivel.  Jimmy and I went to Artist Confidential.  Uh-huh.  I don't know when it's airing, maybe someone can help me out, but, because there are people  out there that care enough to check out the Artist Confidential with Sting. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, dude, oh.  Playing his loot.  The loot.  Like it's 1500.  Here again, it's gonna see the rest of you, to see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die.  Hey, that's my favorite part.  Yeah, that is a real awful line.  Don't step onto my favorite part.  So affected.  To die.  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, and he really worked on making it sound like that.  What a dick.  What a dick bag.  Hey, would ye like to hear some more?  Fucking Renaissance Fair music.  I bet you Roxanne's like, what happened to this faggot?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, where's Roxanne?  Well, at the end of this.  She's back to selling pussy.  Put back on your red light, bitch. 
[01:02:00]  To die.  I got a loot.  To die.  I got a fucking loot now.  They negotiated with Sting to do this R's Confidential on XM, and they just wanted the  guy to play a couple police songs at the end.  Should have kept it confidential.  They wanted to play the police songs at the end to make everyone happy, and they had to  go through hell and back, and then he finally agreed that he would throw everybody a bone  and do one police song and one solo Sting song.  Great, thanks. 
[01:02:30]  And then he did Hell's Hound, I think it's called, by Robert Johnson.  What?  Hell's Hound, I think.  An old blues number.  But before that, we had to listen.  How about you do Message in a Bottle, Roxanne, and you do the other one, Don't Stand So Close  to Me.  And then, you know, there's plenty to choose from, Sting.  Not, doodah.  To thy unkindest shame, for now all I've found for you, I sit, I sigh, I weep, I fage, 
[01:03:00]  I die, and dead in me, and in the squeeze of heart.  Someone will fucking sample that shit, though, and turn it into a hip-hop song.  Yeah, where's Jay-Z?  Come on.  Who fucking opened for him, the half-goat, half-man boy?  It's, this shit sucks.  It's Christmas music without the Christmas.  Motherfucking Patrice is dual souping it. 
[01:03:30]  You are dual souping.  I've tasted shrimp, this didn't like it, but this ham and split pea is magnificent.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That broccoli and cheese stinks.  I had to get the, uh, I had to send out for a special.  They didn't have my chicken chili, I'm very upset.  All right, let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  No soup for me.  No soup for me.  Peter.  Yeah, good morning.  Good morning.  You fuckers, this song was stuck in my head all last week.  I finally got rid of it, and fucking Monday morning, you play it again. 
[01:04:00]  Oops.  Ta-da!  I hope all week long, when you're going to be at work miserable, and you're going to hear  that in your head.  Ta-da!  Ta-da!  Let's say hi to Jim in Denver.  Jim?  Jim?  Chad.  Oh, Chad, sorry.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, that kind of sounds like my vagina.  My vagina.  My vagina.  I sit.  I sigh.  I weep. 
[01:04:30]  I faint.  I die.  In day pain.  And in the misery.  My vagina.  My vagina.  Faggot.  My vagina.  To die.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Ah, the day, the sun that lends me shine.  My frowns to cause me pine and flees me away. 
[01:05:00]  Here it comes again.  The smiles.  The springs that makes my joys to grow.  A frowns the winter's of my home.  The smiles, my springs that makes my joys to grow.  All right.  A frowns the winter's of my home.  You sure that's not Vinny telling his wife how much he loves her? 
[01:05:30]  No, not even me.  That's fucking horrible.  This is what Vinny.  Yeah, this is what Vinny's playing as he gives his flowers to his wife.  To die.  That lute stinks.  Eddie Murphy made it cool to like this thing for like five seconds or two.  What?  From 48 Hours.  What'd he do?  Yep.  Sing Roxanne.  When he was seeing Roxanne in the jail cell with the Walkman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ta-da.  He didn't do that in like a concert setting, did he?  Huh?  People went to see that?  Yeah, Artists Confidential.  Oh, he went to see it. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, did you think you were going to see Sting doing Sting?  Jimmy went to see it.  No, I knew all the politicking that was going on.  I knew.  I knew pretty much what was going to happen.  Ah, that's brutal.  We got to meet him and then the guy was mad because I took a picture with him and the flesh  didn't work, so I actually went to the back of the line and then I apologized  really nicely and I'm like, look, Sting, can I take another one and my flesh didn't work  and he was so annoyed.  I'm like, wow, I'm sorry.  Jesus.  I got to get back to my flute.  That's terrible.  The lute is the harp if it was cool. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  The lute is hoping it was a harp.  Right.  All the night, my sleeps are full of dreams, my eyes are full of streams, my heart takes  snow delight in his triumphant return to the park next to this tree with three people 
[01:07:00]  listening.  Wearing tights with just a huge cock shoving out the front.  That's what I picture.  Yeah, every night.  That's it.  That was the other song.  There's some shoes that curl in the front.  Yeah, curly shoes.  To die.  Little court jester hat.  Like a blousey type of shirt.  Yeah.  Ooh. 
[01:07:30]  And then a king.  He's just missing a king sitting there.  Yeah, king sitting there.  Uh-huh-huh.  Bravo.  Let's all try it.  You can try it at home.  To die.  You got to like-  Can we not?  You got to work your voice.  To die.  To die.  If I ever became famous, I wouldn't want to go down so far to where people say to me,  well, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, make it off.  That's where Michael Jackson is now.  There was a point where that motherfucker, people would cry if they'd seen him.  Yeah.  If they'd seen him, he'd just, look at this stupid motherfucker.  Shut up.  All right.  How many yes men around him, though?  Springsteen, I saw that metal ends. 
[01:08:00]  He played a harpsichord.  Yes, see?  There's no fucking harpsichord on Born in the USA.  What the fuck?  Oh, it was horrible.  He sang the song into a harmonica.  He yelled into the harmonica.  You couldn't understand the work of that.  Are these guys out of their fucking minds?  This is the conversation we had when we were talking about Sting.  It's like, you remember these guys.  I was a huge police fan growing up and stuff.  And then these guys get so famous that they think they could go off on these tangents  and charge top dollars to see them when, you know, you and I, 
[01:08:30]  you're going to see Bruce Springsteen and hear fucking Born in the Run.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fucking play that in your castle somewhere with like 10 of your friends.  Right.  When you saw Springsteen.  Or at least on the ticket, say, well, the ticket prices are, you know,  are 50% because I'm going to be playing a lot of crap that you don't want to hear.  But I'm so famous now.  I get to do whatever the fuck I want.  At Springsteen, we saw him.  It was only five.  You weren't allowed to get beer.  At 10 to 8, no beer sales.  And you weren't allowed to get up to go to the bathroom.  Why?  I swear to God.  At a Bruce Springsteen show.  Yeah, I swear.  And then back in the day, they were all-  Fucking self-important ass. 
[01:09:00]  Back in the day, they were all drunk on stage when they were singing all those songs.  This is the best part.  Swinging the fucking whiskey in between songs.  Yeah.  Everyone around us was sleeping.  It was horrible.  Worst show I've ever seen.  Fucking Neil Young did that to me.  To this day, I'm obsessed and pissed off that I didn't get what I wanted from my Neil Young.  No.  Go fuck yourself.  It doesn't say on the ticket, guess what?  I'm not playing anything you know.  Sorry.  None of the hits.  And guess what?  I'm going to try 10 different instruments tonight because I can.  Yeah.  Self-important, self-serving.  I mean, if you're going to do that, you got it.  See, I'm going back to fucking parking lot. 
[01:09:30]  Why?  You got to let us know what's going on.  Here's the best part.  At Springsteen, you couldn't go to the bathroom during a song.  You had to get up while he was talking.  So I'm coming back.  I pissed off the stage during the song.  When you gave your ticket in, they gave you a list of 10 rules.  No.  I swear to God.  Coming back from the bathroom, the lady would not let me go.  And he was talking.  I go, lady, he's talking.  He was singing.  She said he was singing because he was talking while he was strumming some fucking bizarre instrument.  I'd have pissed all over her legs. 
[01:10:00]  Did he have another story about Wendy that we haven't heard yet?  Hey, Wendy, I signed a big record deal.  Did you?  I was.  Shut up.  Who cares, Bruce?  These motherfuckers get positive.  I was born in a place of peace.  What?  They get all positive.  Yeah.  What happens to our rock heroes is what it comes down to.  Bon Jovi's even worse.  He's really.  Really?  Yeah, he's really pussed out.  He's got the answer.  Is he ever really a man, though? 
[01:10:30]  He has all these political fundraisers at his house, and it's like, whatever.  At least on stage, he's still, you know, I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride.  Yeah, he knows what songs we need to hear.  Sing it, monkey boy.  Sing for your supper.  That's right.  Even stupid Paul McCartney.  When he gets out there, you're going to hear Let It Be.  Yeah.  You came to see Let It Be.  Right.  Not Paul McCartney trying out an opera song.  Yeah.  Or whatever. 
[01:11:00]  Playing his wife's old leg.  A couple of sticks.  Well, that would be kind of fun.  Like a big fucking wooden log.  That'd be fun for everybody.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what's up?  What's happening?  What's up, Bill?  How much, man?  I'm just picturing the real hard police, hardcore police man hearing this for the first time.  You know, it's like, what?  Who?  You dick.  You dick.  Well, I was at Desar's Confidential, and everyone was sitting on their hands, and then we're  like, I guess we're supposed to applaud now, because, you know, Sting is, you know, treating 
[01:11:30]  us to his creative energy.  Yeah, because how do you know when a lute song is over?  Well, I told you the story last week.  As soon as it starts.  It's over, Johnny.  One of these songs ended, and it didn't end, but the crowd thought it ended and started  clapping.  And then the lute player, the main lute player, got so pissed, he puts his hand up really harshly,  like, shut up, we're not done yet.  Hey, I'm not done here.  Don't you know how this song ends?  I don't know.  I thought it ended when the two horses passed each other, and one jousted the other one. 
[01:12:00]  You fucking idiot.  This is a 10,000-year-old instrument.  Oh, man.  What's next?  The pan flute?  Yeah.  The master of the pan flute, Sting.  What's that guy's name?  Zamfier.  Zamfier.  Zamfier.  He sold over 7 trillion records.  More than Elvis and the Beatles combined.  K-Tail Records and Tapes present. 
[01:12:30]  Zamfier, master of the pan flute.  Yeah, you can see that happening.  Yeah, and you stole my leotard line.  Ah, you had your leotard with the big cock in the front line?  All right, Bill.  Hey, by the way, I hope you hit that note pretty good.  To die.  It's horrible, isn't it?  It's just awful.  All right, fellas.  Later, Will.  Does he even know?  Afterwards, does he go, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, and I apologize for being a complete fat.  Yeah.  I'm sorry for just completely fucking your evening up. 
[01:13:00]  What did tickets do that cost?  Did you have to buy tickets?  No, but...  Well, I don't know.  People had to buy tickets.  It was a special XM event, because they taped this R's Confidential thing.  But people were going there thinking they were going to hear some police and sting shit.  You know what you do?  You go seek out a police tribute band.  That's good.  You know what the singer looks like, all the rest of the guys kind of look like, and the  band sounds like it.  Yeah.  And then you go, ah, this is just as good.  Better than seeing fucking Sting, because Sting's going to sing shit and play a lute. 
[01:13:30]  But Emo F from Staten Island, opiates called increasing estrogen levels as you get older.  They turn into women.  They turn into women.  They get all sensitive.  Well, finally, two hours in, I guess, Sting decided to play a police song on the lute.  Do we hear a little of that?  Oh, shit.  You want to hear this?  Say, good, because I didn't, I didn't, I couldn't, I could not even fathom what this  would sound like.  So, I'm glad we have a piece of it.  What song?  We should talk about this, too.  I'm sure people have stories out there.  I saw Bob Dylan once, back in the day, when I was living in Rochester. 
[01:14:00]  He was singing all his songs that you know and love, but you didn't know that.  No.  You had no idea.  Like, people were whispering, like, what song is this, man?  Yeah.  And someone would have to go, that's Positively 4th Street.  Really?  I've heard Positively 4th Street about a thousand times.  Just as angry.  I have no freaking clue.  Positively not it?  Well, no, Bob Dylan, he likes to get up there and just completely do the song completely  different.  If it's a fast song, he slows it down and it's, I don't know.  I don't even like when the words don't line up like they do on the album, because then 
[01:14:30]  you try to sing along.  I don't go to concerts.  And you're all fucked up.  I hate it, because I want to hear what it sounds like on the radio.  Just like the record.  That impresses the shit out of me, when a band can get on stage and do it exactly like  you hear it on the fucking CD.  That's why I don't go see Rap Live.  It's like, I can't enjoy Rap Live.  Rap Live is so bad.  Rap Live?  Those five brothers marching around the stage, stepping on each other, blurting lines out.  It's not mixed right.  It don't sound right. 
[01:15:00]  Just sticking on albums, man.  You're getting shot.  Yeah, I was going to say, a good drive-by.  You're getting shot in the audience.  Yeah, I don't know.  Beaten up and robbed, because I'm white and I'm there.  What's that really famous Bob Dylan song?  That really famous.  He did that at the show.  Wait, the one that he actually tried to sing on?  Lily, Lily, Lily, Lily, Lily.  It rolls my big brass beard.  It's like, wait a minute, this isn't...  And that's unfair to a motherfucker.  I'm a pseudo-rock fan. 
[01:15:30]  I like a few...  Like, if I want to see Lev Zeppelin or something, man, I don't want to see these motherfuckers,  you know...  Let the sun be down.  Down, down, down, down, down, down.  No.  You don't mind if they take one and fuck around with it.  Nah, man.  I want to.  I mean, that's how I feel, but I'm more like Anthony.  You want to hear how the songs, you know, how you've heard them a million times.  Yeah.  They want to experiment with one for a little bit and then jam a bit.  Whatever.  That's fine.  In my life, anyway.  You don't want to hear the hits that you know and love, bastardized. 
[01:16:00]  Butchered.  Yeah.  Completely butchered.  And Zeppelin was a great one for that.  Zeppelin sounded like the record for ten minutes.  And then something happened with Robert Plant and he couldn't fucking hit the notes anymore.  Yeah, it was called heroin.  Was it heroin?  Heroin.  What did he inject it into his throat?  Probably.  Rita Crosby singing fucking Zeppelin.  The guy couldn't hit the notes anymore.  Only Patti LaBelle.  They tuned him down, right?  Yeah.  Aretha Frank.  Only black women could sound just like their records. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Good.  Thank you.  Only, only, only.  I think a lot of them might be able to.  They think it's artistic.  They're not.  That's the whole problem.  Like Springsteen.  Right.  The concert I saw, he's like, well, let me reinterpret this.  No, no, no.  I want you to not reinterpret.  Don't.  Do the fucking song.  Stop it.  Hey, someone's talking about Tool.  You're right.  Scarecrow from Houston.  Have you seen Tool?  They even make the guitarist feedback match the album.  Very true.  See, that's what you want.  All right, well, here is Sting on the Loot doing a police classic, if I even want to  hear it.  No.  Oh, no. 
[01:17:00]  Who's clapping?  Thank you.  Get the fuck out.  I can't tell you what that is.  Name the song.  Oh, God.  No.  I can't even fucking come close.  No.  Don't stand so close to me.  I'm guessing.  Yeah.  Tell me when you recognize the song.  Raise your hand, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Don't stand so close to me. 
[01:17:30]  Nope.  That's.  We're 15 seconds in.  Message in a bottle.  You recognize it, though?  I recognize one note.  One note.  I fucking recognize the note.  I didn't just pull that out of my ass.  Get the fuck out of here.  I fucking got it.  I could name that tune in one note.  I got news for you.  Name that tune.  I got news for you.  Now that I heard it that much, it's really fucking good that way.  You're kidding, right?  No, it's horrible.  But I did recognize it. 
[01:18:00]  I barely hear it now.  Barely.  Just the cast away.  I did not see.  They didn't know.  Yeah.  No, they didn't know.  No, because when you're in that situation and you finally recognize the guitar part of  that song, you start going crazy. 
[01:18:30]  I'll tell you one thing.  I'll tell you one thing.  The fucking vocal kicks in.  That is cool.  Now that's what people, all of a sudden, they freaked out at because that's what they wanted  to hear all night was that voice singing the songs they fucking know.  Well, because he's using his Sting voice, too.  God damn, that sounded good.  Not to die.  That really sounded fucking good.  His vocal.  The cast away, I lost that scene.  Another lonely day. 
[01:19:00]  See, now he changes it.  No one here but me.  I know, he loots it up.  He loots it up.  More loneliness.  See him.  He tricked him.  He fucking tricked him.  He did.  He gave that first line.  It was like, wow, that's good.  Excuse me before I fall into despair.  Too late.  Dispare.  Dispare.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I hope that someone gets mine. 
[01:19:30]  I hope that someone gets mine.  I hope that someone gets mine.  That message.  I hope you sing it like it was.  That message should read, never see Sting.  He sucks.  You've been fucked.  You've been fucked.  Here.  Roxanne.  You don't have to hear a red light. 
[01:20:00]  Those days are over.  You don't have to sell your body to the night.  Put an ocean in the back.  Roxanne.  Beach sound.  You don't have to put on a red light.  Roxanne.  You don't have to put on a red light.  Don't stand so close. 
[01:20:30]  So close to me.  To me.  To me.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't stand losing.  Proper English ass.  Perfectly enunciating douche.  Oh, wait.  That's Steve.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't stand production.  I can't.  I can't.  Message in the bottle. 
[01:21:00]  Message in the bottle.  Oof.  You can really hear where it takes a turn for the worse.  Oh, yeah.  A year has passed since I wrote my note.  I should have known this right from the start.  He sang that first fucking line the way the song goes.  To rope you in.  I can't keep me together. 
[01:21:30]  Love can mend your life, but love can break your heart.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I'll send dinosaurs.  I'll send someone to the world.  I hope that someone gets my.  I hope that someone gets my.  I hope that someone gets my message.  Message.  Message. 
[01:22:00]  It's not how you sing it, idiot.  Message.  Now everyone's all disappointed sitting there.  You know everyone that went.  Woo!  At the beginning of sitting there going.  Oh, fuck.  You turned this into shit too.  Art is confidential.  We didn't know the show was going to suck.  Keep that quiet.  Yeah.  Keep it on the QT.  That's the confidential part.  This sucks.  When I saw the Springteens show. 
[01:22:30]  Don't believe what I saw.  One sec.  Sting.  Playing a lute.  Six million butters.  Washed up on the shore.  Seems I'm not alone in being alone.  Oh, that's the old thing.  Another line.  He gave us two good lines so far.  Six million cast away.  Looking for a home.  I'll send dinosaur eyes to the world.  I'll send dinosaur eyes to the world. 
[01:23:00]  I hope that someone gets mine.  Yeah, we know.  I hope that someone gets mine.  I hope that someone gets mine.  I'm missing.  Goes on for another.  Of course it does.  Jesus, man.  Oh, that's just.  Holy shit.  Brother Joe.  Elkabong him with that lute.  Brother Joe.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  Sting takes it to the extreme and it really sucks when he does it. 
[01:23:30]  But a lot of guys, what they'll do is they'll change things up just because they get so fucking bored.  You know what?  They get bored.  But the people that are paying for the tickets, they've maybe seen them once, twice.  Right.  So they want to see.  And I know when I go to a concert, I want to fucking see and hear the record.  That's it.  I don't want to fucking, I don't want your experimentation thrown in that you could do at home in your studio.  Yeah.  Well, he doesn't play at home in his studio for, you know, for money, for live money. 
[01:24:00]  You know, he's got to do.  You know, when a musician goes on tour, it's the same thing over and over and over.  Yeah, it gets boring.  That's why they're getting paid so much money to fucking do it.  Yeah.  Not to be self-serving.  And that is so selfish as an artist.  He should do a special, you know what he should do?  If you do that, you should do a special, when you're that famous, you should do a special venue, you know, where you go, this is Sting.  This is exactly what you're going to get.  Let everyone know.  Let everyone know. 
[01:24:30]  That's all.  Doing shitty things and experimental things and being good.  He still wants.  All the money that Sting gets thrown at him, you think he gives a shit about, you know, who's here and what.  Obviously not.  See, he wants to get top price for his tickets still.  That's why he's not going to tell you what you're going to get.  That's true.  You know.  How much money do you need?  A lot of bands do it right, though.  A lot of bands do it well.  Like, well, yeah, U2.  They, you know, they break out acoustic versions of some songs that everyone's used to hearing electric.  Yeah, but they got eight billion hits. 
[01:25:00]  And they'll be on stage.  Hello, hello, correctly.  And they'll play all those good hits.  There's a reason why U2 is still great.  They know exactly what their audience wants when you go to a concert.  Hello, hello, correctly.  It's one anthem after another.  They know exactly how to play these songs.  No, Vertigo.  They perform Vertigo exactly as they're supposed to.  Right.  Hello, hello.  Hello, Vertigo.  You never heard the banjo version of Vertigo, have you?  There is a banjo version, I swear to God. 
[01:25:30]  But they did it as a goof.  As a goof.  One of those YouTube videos or something.  They did a banjo version of Vertigo.  It was pretty funny, actually.  If they tried to do that live on stage, it'd be pelted.  Joe, I don't have your guitar song here.  Oh, oh well.  Well, I have, I can't even say it, Guitarther Park.  Guitarther Park is one of them.  Guitarther Park.  Yeah.  It's MacArthur Park.  It's my follow-up to the Guitar Father.  But you said there's another one that's even better.  Yeah, that was A Taste of Honey. 
[01:26:00]  You want me to send it over to Steve?  Do we have it?  You send it to Steve.  Did you send it?  Yeah, sure.  I'll send it right now.  All right, cool.  Yeah, we'll play that.  All right, fellas.  All right, man.  Talk to you soon.  Bye, man.  Later.  Oh, my God, why?  It's not going to change.  We're still hearing it.  Please? 
[01:26:30]  Can we stop it?  No.  Or something?  No.  Because it's really, really bad.  What station would this be played on on XM?  Do we have XM Shit?  Watercolors.  Is that a station?  XM Shit.  Watercolors.  Watercolors.  Suicide 203.  Yeah, you're going to fucking bleed out by. 
[01:27:00]  Could you send the SOS out to your other two bandmates in the form of a,  can we get a reunion concert together?  Because this really ain't working, Stain.  Imagine Andy Summers and Stuart Copeland just sitting at home practicing their instruments  going, well, any day now, he'll fucking call us.  Calling up and going, can you play a lute instead of the guitar?  He's got to be done with this nonsense by now.  Is anybody out there, like, that supports this, though?  I'm sure.  This?  This whole thing.  So few. 
[01:27:30]  This whole thing.  You know what?  This is like classical stuff.  This is in that classical genre.  You know what, though?  Here's what happens.  Sting puts out this album.  It fucking tanks.  He realizes, uh, I got to go back to the old, uh, the old shit.  And then they do a reunion.  They're clapping because it's Sting.  If that was fucking John Smith up there playing a lute, people would have walked out.  That couldn't be played in a fucking restaurant. 
[01:28:00]  Only if they were surprised that it was John Smith, the lute player.  The lute player.  If they went to go see John, the luteist, it'll be different.  But if it was like this, let's go see this dude, John Smith.  This motherfucker.  I heard he's a hard-rocking motherfucker.  Yeah, he rocks, man.  Listen to some of his old shit.  Sounds like the police.  Let's see.  Guys, this proves you're not tools for the company.  This is Earth Brown, FBA from Buffalo.  Oh, we are.  XM did a lot of work to get Sting, and you guys rip it all up.  I can imagine XM management not being too happy with these anti-Sting breaks. 
[01:28:30]  Screw them, too.  We have a lifeboat like we care.  Sting and Buffalo.  We work for two companies now.  We work for two companies.  Both of them could go fuck themselves.  Not at once, though.  That's right.  One at a time, if you're listening.  Just one at a time.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Yes.  Men at work played songs with harps.  All right, whatever.  Who cares?  Who cared then? 
[01:29:00]  Whip it good.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  We're going to take a break.  Whip it.  Grab that whip.  Into shape.  Shape it up.  Get straight.  Go forward.  Go forward.  Move ahead.  Whip it good.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  Bling, bling.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  Come on, Eileen.  Oh, I swear.  Come on, Eileen. 
[01:29:30]  At this moment, you mean everything to me.  Everything.  Okay, this is going to lead into one of our-  Come on, Eileen.  Oh, bling, bling, bling, bling.  This leads to one of our favorite things to do when Patrice is here.  Top 10 country songs in America.  Basically, we read-  We don't know anything about country songs.  We have a lot of truckers that are into the country music that listen to us.  So they love this because they see how just stupid we are when it comes to this genre.  But basically, we get the title of the song, and then we try to figure out what the song's about. 
[01:30:00]  Everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody, wang, chong tonight.  Everybody, wang, chong.  Bling, ding, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  All I hear is radio, goo-goo. 
[01:30:30]  I'm on a Mexican radio.  I'm on a Mexican, wo-wo-radio.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  I want to be your sledgehammer.  Why don't you call my name? 
[01:31:00]  Walk like an Egyptian.  Walk like an Egyptian.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  99 loose balloons.  You know you're rock, Patrice.  Jesus.  Nice.  Oh, shit.  Hey, this is Phil Gordon. 
[01:31:30]  You're listening to the worst of opening.  To the opening.  Sorry.  Jeez, I'm usually good at this.  Hey, this is Phil Gordon.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
