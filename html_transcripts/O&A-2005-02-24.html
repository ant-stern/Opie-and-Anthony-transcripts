<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, broadcasting live from the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles during the World Poker Tour, was a chaotic and wildly unpredictable affair. The broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony recounting a technical malfunction from the previous day’s show, before Anthony detailed his own poker tournament experience. He described his initial anxiety, run-ins with celebrities like Cameron Diaz and Phil Gordon, a crucial fold against Gordon, and his elimination with "big slick."  He also commented on the unusual demographics of the Commerce Casino, noting the lack of slot machines and the high number of Asian and Mexican players.

David Stein, a Fox Sports Radio host covering the World Poker Tour, joined the show to (unsuccessfully) explain the rules of "no-bust" blackjack, leading to much humorous banter.  The conversation circled back to Anthony's poker experiences and his encounters with other celebrities, including James Woods (eliminated by Stein), an intoxicated Deacon Jones (who later appeared on the show, nearly flashing his penis), and Tanya Roberts.  The hosts lambasted their producer, Jimmy, for prioritizing celebrity photos over the broadcast, further criticizing the previous day's chaotic show featuring numerous side conversations, including one started by Rich Voss, which prompted Opie to yell for everyone to listen.

The show then discussed a previous interview with Joe Rogan, Rogan's apparent displeasure at their lack of poker player recognition, and their own harsh criticisms of Jennifer Tilly’s appearance using derogatory language.  They detailed the broadcasting challenges, including poor audio and uninvited onlookers. A caller voiced disapproval of a poker player's online criticism of the show.  The hosts continued recounting their Los Angeles adventures, including visits to Barney's Beanery and a "Graveline Tour" of celebrity death locations (detailing Janis Joplin's death and the suicide of the Glinda actress).  They also recounted Jimmy’s misadventures in celebrity autograph-seeking, including an incident with David Keith.

Yoshi provided the hosts with several pornographic DVDs, resulting in an explicit discussion of their contents and condition.  Listeners called in, and Vince Van Patten was interviewed about his tournament experience.  The segment concluded with Kenny's disastrous news segment preparations and the anticipation of Lemmy from Motörhead and Billy Zabka's arrival, punctuated by a humorous song about a "big, fat friend."

Jim Norton called in from Houston, labelled a "Coffee Diva" for his Starbucks preference, launching a lengthy discussion on coffee.  The hosts then interviewed professional poker player Chris Ferguson at the final table, discussing his career, poker's surprising celebrity, and his tournament experience. Jim Norton recounted further awkward celebrity encounters, including mistaking David Keith for Patrick Swayze and encountering Forest Whitaker, while also mentioning a failed attempt to meet a pornographic actress.  Club Soda Kenny’s disastrous news segment was followed by a shockingly inappropriate musical performance by Mark Tyke and "The King and the Barber," so offensive that the entire audience left.  The show briefly concluded with a humorous interaction with a Mickey Rooney look-alike.

Oscar week saw an in-studio interview with Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead. The hosts debated the pay disparity between hookers and actresses and lamented their struggles to create a polished show.  They anticipated (but doubted) the arrival of "the gang from Clown Porn."  They also contrasted the difficulty of booking big-name guests in New York due to their early morning slot with the apparent lack of celebrity guests in Los Angeles during Oscar week.  Lemmy's arrival was heavily commented upon, his interview covering his Grammy win, prolific career (including work with Ozzy Osbourne), drinking habits (Jack Daniels and Coke), songwriting process, preferences for women, and gambling habits (slot machines). The conversation was laced with sexually explicit comments and jokes, references to pornography, and anecdotes about Lemmy's past.  Kenny added his own brand of humor to the interview, which also touched on various rock and roll anecdotes, and Lemmy’s thoughts on American and British cultures, particularly regarding sex and humor.  Callers phoned in with questions and anecdotes. The show ended with continued drinking and discussion of poker and movies.

A further segment with Lemmy covered Robert De Niro's film choices,  *The Passion of the Christ* (with irreverent commentary),  Lemmy's personal life (including anecdotes about his father's reaction to the film, his lack of religious belief, and a cryptic discussion about an adopted son), a bizarre radio contest story resulting in a previous job loss, observations of a poker game involving an actor, and Lemmy's 1966 UFO sighting.  The conversation also included discussions about radio and television, commercialism, Lemmy's musical career, and off-color jokes. The show concluded with promotion of Lemmy's tour, with the hosts frequently interacting with their production staff.  The show also recounted Ed Asner's previous appearance, his negative interaction with Opie, and his request to have Opie removed from the show.  Finally, the hosts read and reacted to Daniel Negreanu's blog post criticizing their graphic and vulgar sexual conversation with him.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You can't have it here, it's M202. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[00:04:00]  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  It's all right with me.  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just, you better just sit back and watch.  We are just, you better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Stop it.  Stop whining.  I feel naked without our machines.  We didn't even bring them this time.  They weren't missed yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  That's for sure.  Now, there was just so much going on with the program yesterday.  We didn't need no damn machines.  What the hell was that?  Wow, that was a little strange.  What happened there, Opie?  You yelled and all of a sudden I heard an echo that was at twice the volume.  Blew my ears out.  I don't know.  It was in my brain and then all of a sudden I decided to say it.  It was really, it was a little odd.  I don't think they heard that in Radioland, though.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:30]  And we're in Los Angeles, California for the second day of the Commerce Casino.  The Commerce Casino.  We're broadcasting for the World Poker Tour.  Yes.  And right off the bat, I've got to go and say,  thank God Anthony is back in the hot seat.  Oh.  Thank God.  Yes.  Of course, I didn't make the final table.  It's okay, though.  I kind of like hanging out with the show.  I missed a lot of fun stuff yesterday from what I've heard.  Well, you brought your Mi-Fi on the trip, right? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you've got to listen to the show.  And I have to listen.  I mean, there's a lot of, you know, hardcore fans of XM Satellite Radio.  The Mi-Fi just takes it to the next level.  Oh, yeah.  It takes it to the next level.  I'm in a cab and, you know, and at the airport just listening to the show,  catching up on things here and there.  You can listen to whatever you want, whenever you want.  You're not at the mercy of a radio station.  On the way over to the casino, I was listening to yesterday's show on my Mi-Fi in the van while  Kenny was driving like a maniac, like he was Dale Earnhardt Jr. or something. 
[00:06:30]  Dude, that old couple almost clipped us from behind.  I had one faux pas.  Why are you our driver?  Like, shouldn't we have a limo company or something that drives us around?  Because, according to XM, I'm lower than dirt.  Kenny, we're working on that.  But we're driving down one of these L.A. side streets, and Kenny jams on the brake,  and I'm one of these guys.  I don't even, I don't care what you're almost hitting in front of you, 
[00:07:00]  because I figure if you're jamming on the brakes, you're going to be okay.  I always quickly whip my head around to see who's going to plow into us from behind.  Which is probably the worst thing you can do, is get hit from behind while you're turning your neck around.  I understand that, but I want to brace myself in case it's going to be a close call, you know?  Just brace yourself and be surprised.  And there was an old couple, and they were older than dirt.  Their eyes got really wide, and they just jammed on the brakes just in time.  I mean, it wouldn't have done any damage to the vehicle we're driving.  It's some kind of van with, like, five or six rows of seats. 
[00:07:30]  It's a van for 400 people.  They use it to transport Mexicans up from the border, usually, up into San Diego.  Either that or the Blue Dots that have to go to the casino and gamble away their hard-earned welfare money.  That's true.  Or welfare money, their retirement money, whatever.  You don't see many of those here at this casino.  This is kind of a weird casino.  It's not like your normal, like people are used to Atlantic City or Vegas or something like that.  This, not a lot of old people come in here because there's no slot machines. 
[00:08:00]  If you've noticed, you can walk in here without all those goddamn slot machine sounds and the old people working the slides.  It's pretty much you're here for poker.  There are poker tables all over the place.  And blackjack, but all I could find is this no-break blackjack.  What the hell is no-break blackjack?  No-bust blackjack.  Did you ever hear this?  Do you know what it is?  I don't know.  Do you know how to play?  Because I have no clue.  I was watching.  I was standing by one of the tables for a while watching with, you know, money burning a hole in my pocket before the show. 
[00:08:30]  Because you wanted in.  I figured I was going to play a few hands of blackjack before the show.  And I see this no-bust blackjack.  Like, well, okay, I'll just watch and see what's going on.  But as someone's phone goes, it's not mine.  I will lose my mind before the show is over and just rip out people's cell phones and heave them against the wall.  Well, you already threw my trio away.  Yes, your trio is done.  I was getting updates.  I was getting an email from Eric back in New York.  I'm turning it off.  It wasn't mine.  No, it wasn't mine.  I'll just turn it off.  Mine's off.  Anyway, we've got David Stein. 
[00:09:00]  You're the radio host for the World Poker Tour on Fox Sports Radio.  And you know what this no-bust blackjack's about?  I had never heard of it.  I was actually here last week playing poker, and I got tired, and I just started walking around.  And I said, oh, I'll play some blackjack.  And I sat down, and I watched a couple of hands, and it was a blackjack with which I am not familiar.  Yeah, all this.  I'm watching him play, and, like, someone will have, let's say, a 16 in front of him.  The dealer's shown a face card.  And then the guy goes, hit me. 
[00:09:30]  He hits.  He gets, like, an 8, which is, you know, you're over.  Yeah.  But he goes, and then he'll stay.  They might as well just call it.  He's got 24.  They might as well just call it do-over blackjack.  Yeah, do-over blackjack.  So he stayed on 24.  It's blackjack for retards.  Yeah.  It pretty much is.  It's blackjack for retards.  I don't understand how it's played.  What you didn't do.  Because then the dealer could also go over 21.  And then what happens? 
[00:10:00]  Like, whoever's closest to 21?  Is that it?  David Stein.  Well, they don't have the bus groups coming to this casino.  No.  They have the short bus groups coming to this casino to play.  No bus blackjack.  So you have no idea?  I got the brochure.  I read the brochure, and I still didn't understand it.  Dude, you were nodding your head.  The only reason you're wearing that headset is because I thought you were going to be the expert on this.  No, I was nodding my head in agreement that it is the funkiest game I've ever seen in a casino.  Yeah.  If you bust, you have the option of staying in. 
[00:10:30]  So it's like playing, what's the TV game show where you bet so you don't get over?  Card Sharks?  I think it was Card Sharks.  Yeah.  David, you're adding nothing to this.  I'm adding absolutely.  I'm here for the poker.  I'm poker-licious.  I was like thinking, you know, Ann comes up with a good point.  I'm thinking, oh, we got the answer right here.  He's sitting in the front row of this empty room.  Thought he had it.  There's no one else to talk to here.  Can somebody run down and get a brochure for me? 
[00:11:00]  The next thing I know, he has no clue on it.  You know what?  Brush up.  We'll have you back on.  Get a brochure.  Brush up.  And then you can explain the game to me.  That's blackjack.  That's blackjack.  All right.  Well, yeah, this casino is beyond strange, though.  And I noticed that there's a lot of...  As I look around the room.  What?  Oh, we have one over there.  What?  What?  A lot of...  A lot of Asian guys.  A lot of guys that look like him.  And then a lot of Mexicans. 
[00:11:30]  Well, we are, you know, Southern California.  Southern California, lots of people.  But that's the only people that are playing here.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, Mexican guys and Asian guys.  I went into one of the other poker rooms, and it was just all like Asian guys.  Yeah.  They love playing the poker.  Love it.  But, yeah, no slot machines.  No...  Was there any regular blackjack?  I couldn't find it.  There's no regular blackjack.  There's no regular blackjack.  No.  Thank goodness.  Could someone explain what this casino's all about?  It's about poker, man.  Yeah, but how are they allowed to do it? 
[00:12:00]  I have no idea.  Usually it's on some Indian reservation is how they get away with it in a lot of the country.  Yeah, I'm trying to talk over the buzzing, humming noise.  Someone's phone.  Who has a phone?  All right.  Who has cell phones right now on them?  Off.  Off.  Yours is off.  Off.  Off.  You guys?  Off.  Poe, off.  Anyone else have a cell phone on them?  Oops.  What?  No, I'm just kidding.  No one else has a cell phone?  What if it's yours?  It isn't. 
[00:12:30]  Mine's off.  You were just calling the person that texted you in the middle of the night.  Off.  Off.  Off.  Yeah, I know.  I get a text message at 5 in the morning going,  Hey, how's it going?  I can miss you.  You know what I like about this place?  What's that?  They have liquor in the front and poker in the rear.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  Club soda candy, everyone.  Fantastic.  All right, so I guess we need the setup here.  We're in this empty room.  Is this like the press room or something? 
[00:13:00]  No, this is what they call an overflow audience room.  Okay.  Now, in the main room where the final table is,  where the people will be playing the last round of poker for the championship of this  invitational, there's seats all around that.  Plenty of seats in there.  But there's overflow audience.  People that come in, want to watch it, but can't now fit into the main room.  They will slowly be brought into here to watch it on these TV screens we will see.  So these are just going to be people sitting here.  These are people that are going to watch poker on TV? 
[00:13:30]  On TV.  There's about 100 seats in here.  Yeah.  They're going to be watching it on TV with us sitting here in front of them saying stuff  that they probably don't want to hear.  So there's going to be a room full of losers.  And I'm not talking about people that were in the tournament that didn't go far.  Yeah, I can't really.  Like losers in life.  Who watches poker on TV next door to where they're actually doing it?  Same people are watching televised fishing.  And it's big.  Yeah.  But I think if you're at home watching it, it's cool. 
[00:14:00]  You're not at the event, so you want to watch it.  You want to see who wins.  That's cool.  But to be here at the event and then watch it on a TV is a little odd.  A little odd, yes.  It's a little weird.  You're in a casino.  Go play some no-break poker or blackjack for it.  However, that's how you play it.  Well, and the final table starts at what, 2?  Final table starts at 4 o'clock.  3 o'clock?  2, 3, 4.  I heard 2.  I think maybe it's 3.30.  3.15, I think.  Well, here's 5.  5, 5.  Give me 5.  Give me 5 and a half. 
[00:14:30]  5, 5, 6.  6 o'clock.  3 o'clock is what I heard.  Well, we're just getting warmed up.  Final table.  I want to thank David for fucking up the beginning of the show here.  Nothing to add as far as the...  Oh, I've got plenty to add from yesterday.  Yeah, all right.  You know what?  We can get into that.  Why don't we get into that?  So, Anthony's back with the show today.  Yesterday was very exciting.  He did the first two hours of the show, and then he went to table 14 to be in this tournament.  And you've got to walk us through it, man. 
[00:15:00]  All of a sudden, you dropped your headset and your microphone, and you were off.  Sat down.  What were you thinking?  I was just very nervous.  Yeah.  You know, first tournament ever.  I'm looking around the room.  A lot of celebrities, you know.  And it wasn't just, you know, slash celebrities.  There were some named people out there.  The poker players, too.  Just, you know, legends in poker.  And poker players that I've seen on TV playing.  And, you know, you're a fan of these guys.  And they're sitting there, you know.  In my case, at the table, I'm sitting at.  So, it was pretty nerve-wracking at first. 
[00:15:30]  You can only put it to somebody as, picture you're, you know, you're a Yankee fan.  And all of a sudden, you're brought out onto the field to play, you know.  How would you feel?  You'd be a little nervous, you know, in that whole setting.  And you're looking around, and it's the same set that you see on television.  Same people.  When you first sat down, from my vantage point, you looked.  Scared shitless.  I got him in.  I was sitting there, I'm like. 
[00:16:00]  And then after, but the funny thing is, I was looking at you and going, man, he's trying  to look cool, calm.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, exactly.  And, you know, in all fairness, about a half hour, 40 minutes went by.  And then I could see that you were definitely much more relaxed.  But at first, I could tell you were just freaking out and wanting to jump out of your own skin.  It didn't really even take that long, to tell you the truth.  I'm used to doing stuff like, you know, getting on stage and performing and stuff like that.  And I get nervous before that.  And you're like, why am I doing this?  Jesus Christ, I should just go and crawl under my bed. 
[00:16:30]  And then once you start getting into it and doing it, you're happy to be there and the  nerves kind of go away.  But at first, yeah, very nervous.  And I'm looking around the table.  And what's her name?  Catherine Manheim?  Cameron.  Cameron Manheim.  Yeah, Cameron.  Who's sitting on two chairs.  I thought she was actually smaller than she looks on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  Well, yeah, all the rag magazines are talking about how much weight she's lost in the last  few years.  But she's still a big girl, man.  Yeah.  Unless she started gaining the weight back. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  So she was sitting there.  She was sitting at the table.  She was pretty much the only one there when I sat down.  And then Min the Master came over.  He's a pro poker player extraordinaire.  So he sat down.  And I'm thinking to myself, great.  Here's this guy.  He's just going to clean house.  And, you know, there's no way I'm beating him.  And then other people started slowly sitting at the table.  I didn't recognize a couple of them.  But then, you know, a couple of them were just, you know, Annie Dukes, who is a very  famous poker player.  You know, she's very good. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cute girl.  Notorious.  Just really good poker player.  And, you know, I just started trying to get into a rhythm.  And I stuck to my strategy.  I wasn't going to jump out there and be too aggressive at the beginning.  And I lived through a couple of people getting booted out and stuff like that.  So the strategy worked.  It worked very well.  I won a few hands.  It was very exciting, you know, putting a big bet in there and watching someone like  Men the Master just back down and fold his hand.  And I, you know, rake it in. 
[00:18:00]  Felt pretty good.  You know, I'm at the tournament.  And after a while, the blinds, the blind bets, the mandatory blinds and the antis started  going up.  Now, if you can win enough hands to keep yourself even to pay for the price of just  playing, which are the antis and the blinds, that's fine.  But as the time goes by, these antis and blinds go up in value.  So now you've got to win more.  So you've got to be a little more aggressive.  Uh, I was getting shit cards. 
[00:18:30]  No excuses.  It happens.  But I really was being dealt crap.  Uh, the only pair I was dealt the entire time was a pair of nines and a pair of sevens.  That was the only pocket pairs I was ever dealt the whole time I was sitting there.  So I was getting some pretty crappy cards.  Um, I decided to play an ace five suited, uh, figured what the hell, you know, I got  to start being a little more aggressive.  So I put in, um, and, uh, this was when, um, what's his name? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Phil Gordon comes over.  He, he had sat down, which made me just go, Jesus Christ.  Now I, now I know it's completely over when that Phil Gordon sits down.  So now you've got three professional poker players at your table.  He comes over with a stack of chips and goes, Hey, is there an empty seat here?  Like, Oh Jesus.  Did he really say that?  Yeah.  And he sits down and you know, it's Phil Gordon.  Well, you got to explain as people were getting eliminated, then they would add, you know,  bring more people onto your table.  Yeah.  You weren't eliminating a whole table.  They would just consolidate tables.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a couple of people left in one table. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  So they would throw them at, uh, the empty seats at some of the other tables.  So I decided to play the, uh, ace five and Phil's playing.  Uh, I bet, um, flop comes out.  Uh, it's an ace.  A queen.  And I believe that a 10.  So now I'm sitting on a pair of aces.  So I, I figure I'm going to slow play it.  I want to see what he's got maybe.  So I checked the bet.  He comes across and bets two grand.  So I'm like, screw it.  You know, I got a pair. 
[00:20:00]  I put two grand in.  Uh, next card comes out.  Doesn't help me at all.  I'm still sitting on the pair of aces.  I have one, uh, and, and one, one is in the middle there.  Community cards.  And, uh, Phil puts in a shitload of chips, which would put me all in.  Um, now I'm forced to either fold or put in my entire chip stack and, and see what happens.  I opted to fold out.  Oh, see.  Now I'm thinking to myself.  That's why I can never play poker. 
[00:20:30]  You know why I folded?  I was assuming.  That was a very smart move.  I was assuming.  I had a pair of aces.  I, it's not, it's not that good.  Uh, I'm assuming he probably had that queen and an ace.  So he's sitting on two pair.  I understand that.  But my, my whole personality, I would not be, I would have to play it out.  In hindsight, I'm thinking I should have played it.  But really I, I folded.  So that cost me a couple, put me on tilt a bit.  I was a little flustered.  I had, you know, blew a couple of grand.  You should have been able to at least lean over to Phil and go, come on, man. 
[00:21:00]  I'm an amateur.  Tell me.  Did you have it?  No, I couldn't.  And I'll never know.  I'll never know.  That's what I can handle.  I mentioned this a bunch of times yesterday.  I would have to know what the other guy, it would drive me nuts.  Not knowing what he had.  It did.  All night long.  It drove me nuts.  Because all I've been doing is going over my head like, god damn, I should have played  that hand.  I had the pair of aces.  It was on the board.  I'm assuming he had two pair.  But who knows?  Maybe he had queens.  Maybe he assumed, because I checked after the flop, maybe he assumed I didn't have the 
[00:21:30]  ace.  And since he had the queen, which is the next highest there, maybe that's why he was betting.  And I could have, you know, could have, should have, would have.  You just never know.  So I was a little flustered from losing a couple of grand there.  The blinds, like I said, are getting higher.  I really don't have much time.  So the next hand is dealt.  And I'm dealt what is called big slick, Opie.  It's the ace king.  I have an ace king.  Suited.  Suited.  Yeah.  Suited.  Very good hand to start with.  I'm looking at my stack, and I'm like, gotta do it. 
[00:22:00]  All in.  Go all in.  The flop is just crap for me.  It's all low cards.  The guy I'm playing against, I don't even know what his name was, but we both lay our  cards down.  I had that.  He had a pair of queens.  Boom.  Lays it down.  So now the only thing that could help me with the next two cards that are coming out  is an ace or a king.  And it just didn't happen.  You know, three comes out, and then a six.  Just crappy low cards.  And that was it.  That spelt my demise right there.  Big slick equal big dick once again.  I hate big slick because it never fucking works for me. 
[00:22:30]  Did you think about this last night?  Because I went out five minutes before Anthony.  Anthony lasted five minutes longer than the guy from the World Poker Tour.  Yeah.  So hats off, and kudos to you.  No, Anthony did great, just really fast.  I felt fine about my performance.  We ended the broadcast yesterday as you were pretty much going.  Going back to the table, and I think it lasted another half hour after that.  Yeah.  It was a little while.  I felt good about it.  And after the broadcast, I went over to your table to really check it out because I really  couldn't because I was trying to keep the clusterfuck that was our program yesterday 
[00:23:00]  under control.  That's what I heard.  But as soon as the show was over, I ran over because I was really curious to check  out your progress.  And then I looked around the room.  I'm like, oh, my God.  There's like eight.  I think it was at least eight tables completely empty.  Yeah, they had cleared out a lot of tables.  Man, my pal Anthony did quite well here.  I felt good about it.  I got my feet wet in tournament play, which I had never done before.  And I could definitely see me doing something like that again.  I was going to say to the audience that you heard that audience.  Anthony will be jetting all over the country now from poker tournament.  I think I'm going to. 
[00:23:30]  He's got the bug.  I guarantee it.  I think I'm going to get into it a little bit.  Anthony, what did you do over the weekend?  Oh, I was in Foxwoods.  A little tournament.  A little tournament.  I guarantee you're in now.  It's fun.  It's very exciting.  It's like a thrill, man.  The adrenaline rush you get when you're playing these hands and when you beat one of these  pros.  And that's what I said was my goal, is just to play a hand and maybe beat one of these  pros out and have that rounders moment. 
[00:24:00]  And it happened.  And it was very cool and a lot of fun.  I had a great time.  Yeah, very good.  It was a lot of fun yesterday to check out.  A lot of celebrities.  Well, now we're down to the final table today.  They're going to be doing that whole thing later on this afternoon.  So, David, what else have you got?  Well, there are a couple things.  Did you learn the cardinal rule of tournament play?  Because I got bumped out with a pair of aces and a pair of threes.  And the reason...  I had two pair, aces and threes.  Now, you've got to play it. 
[00:24:30]  Well, half the time you should play it and half the time you should fold it.  It's very difficult to fold...  See, I can't...  To fold two pair.  Were there a pair...  On the flop?  No.  On the flop?  No.  I mean...  There was a four on the flop.  There was my eight and my three.  So now you're like...  So the only thing that could beat me would be three fours.  Right.  So I go all in against my better judgment because I know that the key to tournament play is not gambling.  You're not gambling in a tournament.  You're just trying to stay in the tournament. 
[00:25:00]  And that's why you see a lot of these pros fold early and you're going, my God, I won that hand from them.  But again, they're just trying to stay in the tournament.  They're trying to keep their chip stack up.  And sure enough, you know, the guy had three threes.  Three fours.  Three fours.  Three fours.  So I went out.  Did he have two fours in his hand?  He had two...  He had pocket fours.  Jesus Christ.  He had pocket fours.  But the highlight of the day, I don't know if you caught this on ESPN, in their top ten this morning, they showed James Woods going out.  Oh, yeah?  Thank you very much.  Sent James Woods' ass packing.  And he needed to go home. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  He was a little cocky.  He was a little cocky.  I mean, he knows a lot about poker and he plays in all the tournaments.  Wait a minute.  You sent him packing?  He went all in against me.  I said...  And it was like 25 minutes into the tournament.  What was the hand?  I had four spades.  So I was looking to pull a flush on the river.  And he showed a pair of fives.  He showed a pair of fives.  So I was like, yeah, okay, whatever.  You know, he didn't have a big chip stack. 
[00:26:00]  I'd like him to stay.  It's kind of cool playing poker with James Woods.  So I went all in, threw him a little bone.  And sure enough, I got the spade flush.  Nice.  And he got up and he half-heartedly shook my hand.  And Stephen Collins from 7th Heaven.  Of course, y'all TiVo that.  Yeah.  Stephen Collins was there and he said something like,  Wow, I wish you could have stayed longer, Jim.  And I got to jump in. 
[00:26:30]  And so I go, well, you know, you beat the traffic.  Which hurt even more.  Grind it in a little.  Let there be no mistake, man.  If you're one of the celebrities playing in this thing, you don't want to go out.  It's not like, well, you know, I'm James Woods and I'm busy anyway and I have stuff to do.  These guys are very competitive.  They want to stay in.  Their dream is to be at that final table and continue playing.  Well, that's like Deacon, excuse me, Deacon Jones was out in the first 10 minutes.  Oh, Deacon Jones was talking smack yesterday on that show. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, because you were on the show at that point.  Deacon Jones is talking smack big time.  He's pissed off at someone that was just trashing him in the L.A. Times sports section.  He was like the first paragraph of the coverage of this tournament.  And he's like, you know, all pissed off.  I'll show him, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, I think he was the first guy out of the whole tournament.  Oh, he absolutely was the first guy.  Deacon Jones was the first guy out of the whole tournament.  Really?  After he was talking all that smack on our program show.  He was at the table next to me.  I had Tanya Roberts at my table.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:27:30]  And, you know, she was the fifth or sixth Charlie's Angel.  I don't remember.  And, well, she got to be close to 50.  Yeah.  And she's been to the factory a couple of times, but she looked great.  Still looked good?  I don't wear sunglasses at the table.  I hate people who wear sunglasses at the table.  I could have used sunglasses because those things would just poke them in the eye the whole time.  Oh, really?  So you could have given the inadvertent little look?  She may have never played poker before.  That's how innocent she was.  Well, I was talking to, I think you were still doing the show with me.  I was talking to Kelly Packard from Baywatch and Ripley's Believe It or Not, and basically 
[00:28:00]  admitting, like, if there was a hot chick at my table, I would have problems.  I'd be too busy, you know, taking looks and stuff, and then I would be distracted.  Scoping it out.  And then you're like, oh, you know, are you pretty much trying to say that women don't  have any skill in poker?  And I'm like, well, I don't know, but I know I would be looking.  Like I really meant that.  I know.  There was more under-the-bus tossing yesterday than ever before.  It was one of the greatest shows we've done as far as just leaving people out to dry.  Oh, hanging everyone out to dry. 
[00:28:30]  All right, David Stein, thank you for stopping by.  You'll be around, walking in and out, right?  I'll be walking in and out.  Try to find the rules to that goddamn game.  Okay.  Yeah, that's your goal.  Maybe we'll play after.  Maybe after the show.  I'm hell with fish.  I'm great with fish.  And war?  Did you hear me yell Uno during the tournament?  Uno.  That was me.  Right on.  That was me.  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We're in some weird back room, but we got a good program here for you guys.  There's a poker table back there, too, that I hear maybe we might be able to get  some cards going.  Yeah, we'll get something going on.  Yeah, we're going to shuffle some cards over there. 
[00:29:00]  All right, Ben, what else we got going on today?  I know we got Steve's porno guy here.  Oh, Yoshi's here.  I know.  Better known as Yoshi.  You can always tell when Yoshi shows up, there's a stack of pornography next to me.  Yeah, we'll get into that next.  It's like Christmas for Stevie.  It's all exciting.  Yeah.  We have a whole bunch of things to get to.  So why don't we take our first break, and we'll continue with the Opium Anthony program.  We're broadcasting live from the World Poker Tour at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles, California.  Stay there.  Hello, my name is Elaine, and I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles. 
[00:29:30]  The only difference between hookers and actresses...  Okay, you want to fill me in?  Hookers get paid more.  That's where the bottom line is.  It's a bunch of geeks and a bunch of porn stars in the same place at the same time.  Hot young men pointing at each other.  Getting educated every minute.  By someone making grilled cheese with an iron.  I'm still with criminals.  Holy crap.  Say goodbye to your tea cells, everyone.  Live from Los Angeles.  Just pummel them with nightsticks. 
[00:30:00]  The Opium Anthony Show.  Opium Anthony.  XM 202.  Head like a hole, black as a stone.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Head like a hole, black as a stone.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve. 
[00:30:30]  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  And we're back with the Opium Anthony program broadcasting for the World Poker Tour at the  Commerce Casino in Los Angeles, California.  We'll get the energy back into the show now.  I want to ask him one question.  I didn't expect a 20-minute conversation.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  Anyway, a lot of fun, a lot of fun, though.  Where's Jimmy?  We missed Jimmy today.  Well, Jimmy is on his way to Houston for, you know, his gigs.  He's very busy with his gigs.  That he ended up promoting ad nauseam.  Oh, did he?  Dude, don't ever leave me again.  Don't ever leave me again.  I mean, it was fun.  I had to play some carts.  You know, I mean, Jimmy, you know, he's great at what he does.  We all know that.  But as far as trying to concentrate and helping me out, you know, knowing that you weren't 
[00:31:30]  around, because there's a whole chemistry thing you and I do.  Sure.  There are so many times he just, he would just leave the show to get a celebrity photo.  No, you're sitting there doing the show.  I'm doing the show.  And you figure somebody to bounce off of would be Jimmy.  Yeah.  And he just takes his headset off and walks away.  Yeah.  As soon as there was a celebrity, there was one point where I'm doing the show by myself  and I'm asking Ben or Steve or somebody, where's Jimmy?  Oh, he's over there because he saw like whatever, some actor.  Oh my God. 
[00:32:00]  And he thought that was a perfect opportunity for him to run off and get a picture taken.  Yeah.  And I'm like, shouldn't that be like your third priority?  The show should be first.  The show should be your first priority, but it's not with him.  He's got three other priorities before the actual show.  Number one is to get laid.  Right.  And if that means leaving the show, he will do that.  He'll do it.  If he gets a call on his cell phone while we're doing our show, even in New York, he  will get up and leave.  He won't even tell us where he's going.  He'll just leave.  True.  We saw that happen in New Orleans. 
[00:32:30]  All of a sudden, he was negotiating lap dances during the commercials and stuff.  And next thing you know, we're on that balcony.  I'm like, where's Jim?  Oh, he's getting a lap dance.  Yeah.  We're broadcasting.  That was the whole reason we flew down to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  But he's a sex addict.  Sex addict.  So he had to get that out of life.  Addictions usually get in the way of work and family and things like that.  So that's number one.  And then number two is celebrity photos, without a doubt, which yesterday was a complete nightmare  because there were so many celebrities around.  It was ridiculous.  Foaming at the mouth, Jimmy.  Also, like I would turn.  I'm talking to Joe Rogan, who did a great job on the show yesterday. 
[00:33:00]  And then I'm turning to get Jim's comment.  And all I see is like his headset sitting on the table.  And he's like, he's off and running to get another photo.  Well, at least he had Rogan there, who I heard was just an animal.  Well, yeah.  He understands.  Taking all advantage of satellite radio.  I was going to say, he understands what satellite radio is all about.  And he wanted to see how far he could go.  And then the other thing with Norton is if he has to take a leak.  He just gets up and goes.  Yeah.  Yeah, he doesn't.  Mid-conversation a couple times. 
[00:33:30]  No, waiting for break.  Yeah, mid-conversation.  I think he figured there were enough people there that maybe you wouldn't notice he was  gone.  There were enough people with headsets on and microphones in front of them that he could  leave and maybe you wouldn't notice.  It was fun.  It was definitely fun because it was a different type of show.  But to do that day in and day out, forget it.  And then you have Rich Voss, who doesn't have headphones on.  And he's starting his own radio show during the show.  There were two shows at once going on.  And so then at one point, I just yelled, do you ever fucking listen? 
[00:34:00]  I'm just like a babysitter here.  Because we're getting into some kind of conversation.  It was me, Rogan, and one of the celebrities or something.  And as a radio guy, I'm like, wow, this is good.  This is going to be a good 10, 15 minutes of radio.  We're heading in a nice direction.  And all of a sudden, Voss is talking to Norton about some silly thing that has nothing  to do with what we're talking about.  And they're not listening to what I'm saying.  And I was like, are you kidding me?  What, Ben?  We're talking about getting photos.  Because then Voss got excited.  Yeah, Voss was getting photos, too.  Yeah, because Voss is the one that, you know. 
[00:34:30]  And then they're discussing how they're going to get the next photo.  Okay, I'll go up to him.  All right, is the camera set?  Yeah, the camera set.  Okay, make sure you don't cut my head off.  Meanwhile, you're having a whole different conversation.  Yeah.  And then after the photo's taken, then they have to show each other.  And I'm like, that's great, guys, but we're doing a freaking radio show, you idiot.  What jackasses?  So Norton's, you know, in the air right now.  He's going to be at the Houston Improv.  So, you know.  There you go.  Go down there and see him if you're in Houston.  And with that said, he killed on the show yesterday.  I know.  You know, so I don't need the listeners going, whoa, whoa, blah, blah, blah.  He did great. 
[00:35:00]  Joe Rogan is just amazed that, you know, Norton pulls off that celebrity interview thing  over and over again.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A better reaction than we've had in New York.  He goes, why are they even going to answer him?  And, like, he's just amazed by the whole bit, you know.  Just amazed.  Yeah.  And then you had Deacon Jones.  You went back to the table.  Deacon Jones comes back on the show.  Just completely hammered.  Hammered.  He got knocked out really early in the tournament.  You haven't heard the show yet, right?  No, no.  We almost had him whip out his dick. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  He was, why not?  He said he had a 15-incher.  Come on.  I swear to God.  It's not a gay thing.  That's like a, that's a freak show that anyone wants to check out.  You've got a 15, you know, incher.  So I go, yeah, let's see.  He goes, you want me to whip it out?  I'm like, you're teasing the wrong freaking radio show.  You know, because you know how some guys will, oh, you know, I'll whip it out.  I'm like, well, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Pull out, uh, pull out the old Deacon.  So then he, like, backs off a little and Voss pulls out his, you know, Polaroid of his  penis. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah, but he carries it around.  And then Deacon's like, what the, what?  He was all just like, what?  And then I go, well, Deacon, I got to be honest with you.  I've seen his dick.  I've just seen his.  And then all of a sudden, Deacon Jones, I don't even know if it, you know, it was the last  thing that was said on the show yesterday.  Right.  But all of a sudden, Deacon just looks around the table like, what?  Is this a gay show?  He just was out of his mind.  And that was the last thing that was heard on the show yesterday.  I think it got in.  I think it got in.  I think it was, like, pretty much the last thing.  And then he was, like, frightened of Norton.  He thought Norton was going to kill his whole family or something. 
[00:36:30]  Opie?  Why?  What?  You weren't fortunate enough to see my penis yet.  No.  The other way, Kenny.  You are big and stupid.  My penis is tattooed.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  It says, OK.  But when it gets erect, it says, Oklahoma.  Can someone take his headset off, please?  Wait.  Why would it say, OK?  Because when then it gets erect and then there's a lot more room for it.  You would think, though, it would be O-A. 
[00:37:00]  And then when it got erect, you'd see Oklahoma, everything in the middle.  I went to a real good tattoo artist.  That's the dumbest joke.  I know.  He was filled with dumb jokes last night after we got out of here.  I decided, you know, we're walking down Melrose.  And Kenny decides that I'm in danger or something.  So he's in this big, huge, white van that's, what, like 30 feet long.  And every time, you know, I would look across the street.  You know, I'm walking Melrose. 
[00:37:30]  It's all the cool shops and stuff.  He was tailing you in a van?  Yeah.  And parking across the street, just giving this, like, creepy, like, stare.  Like, God, what a freak.  Like he was, like, cruising for, I don't know, middle-aged boys or something.  It was creepy.  Right, Ben?  It was funny.  He'd smile.  He'd look over.  And he'd smile and wave at you.  And then he'd just always look behind you.  And he'd be, like, a half a block behind us.  Then we're jumping in stores and stuff.  We'd get out of the stores thinking nothing of it.  And then he's across the street at that location. 
[00:38:00]  With binoculars.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you had a long walk.  So I didn't want, you know, you had a ride on the way back.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Yeah, I know what I'm doing.  Very nice.  Nice guy.  And then he probably got Jay evicted.  Your friend Jay evicted from his building last night.  Can he proceed to beep on the horn for about five minutes straight?  Yeah, we were all just getting very, very silly.  Yeah.  Very, very silly after the program yesterday.  We got in the elevator to go back upstairs.  And Steve was pointing out how Ben had to just rush to get a drink somewhere after the show. 
[00:38:30]  That wasn't true at all.  I went shopping, Steve.  You did?  Shopping for a drink?  Oh.  I thought he was doing the 100-meter dash to the nearest bar.  So I was just like, I am so tired.  I can't do that.  That whole gossip thing that Ben is known for is starting to rub off on Steve.  Yeah, Steve gets all his.  The second we got in the elevator, that elevator door shut.  And Steve's like, well, there goes Ben sprinting off to a good door.  We all jumped into the van and went up to Melrose. 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  First of all, Steve.  I almost bought a $172 shirt.  I was out of my mind.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  There is no way you would have put the bill for that.  We were at the, what, Fred Siegel?  This is L.A.  There's plenty to do.  I have plenty of friends here.  I don't want to go back and sit in the hotel like you and Jim sitting there waiting for your porn shoot.  Hey, I'd check out a porn any day.  I'd give up a drink to go watch a porn shoot.  Yeah, we, I don't know.  Yeah, that porn thing didn't work out.  We're all punks of weirdos.  But let's go back a little bit.  Then we had the whole Ed Asner thing.  You know, if you're just tuning into the show today, you missed yesterday's show, or you're just getting XM Satellite Radio, I guess we'll replay yesterday's show over the weekend. 
[00:39:30]  You've got to hear the Ed Asner thing.  He hated me.  He told Ben and Norton to get rid of that fucking wasp, meaning me.  You blew any chance in the future of ever having Ed Asner on the show?  I don't know.  We hugged at the end, though.  You did?  Yeah, he gave me a big bear hug.  Then he told Jim.  Jim got several photos with him for some reason.  He had to get different angles with Ed Asner.  But then after he hugged you, he told Jim to get rid of the fucking wasp. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Was he being all political and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Is that what happened?  Yeah, then Jim, you know, then Jim decides that he's a liberal.  Oh, my Jesus.  You know, because I'm thinking another perfect opportunity to have a nice exchange here, you know, because everyone knows Ed Asner, Hollywood type.  He's a bedwetting liberal.  He's as left as you get.  Yeah.  And, you know, Norton, he leaves pretty conservative, more conservative than he wants to admit.  And all of a sudden, I'm thinking, here's a great 10, 15 minutes of radio. 
[00:40:30]  And Norton's like, yeah, I agree with everything you say, Ed.  I'm like, oh, these guys were killing me yesterday, Anthony.  I'm like, what is killing me?  So everything with Ed Asner left off nice, though?  Yeah, I was kind of bummed you weren't there for that because, you know, the whole loo, loo, loo.  Oh, I would have just been, you know.  And I was about to attempt, like, you know.  Loo.  I was going to attempt an impression.  I'm like, what am I doing?  Do the whole interview in this voice.  Okay, Lou.  Yeah.  And then the biggest surprise from yesterday's program was that professional poker player, 
[00:41:00]  Daniel.  Daniel Negreanu, yeah.  Yeah.  He stopped by to say hi to us.  He got kicked out early.  You beat him.  Uh-huh.  You beat him in the tournament.  You lasted a little longer.  Well, I lasted a little longer than he did.  Yeah, whatever.  And we've learned that he made $4.5 million playing poker last year.  One of the most successful poker players playing.  Well, he was bragging and telling us all about that.  Yeah.  And then it came up that he was distracted or something, and he broke up with his fiancee  or something like three days prior to the tournament.  Uh-huh.  And he said something like, I just wasn't feeling it today, or I was just here for fun 
[00:41:30]  or whatever.  You know, he wasn't expecting to go so far.  He was a little bummed about his chick, you know, breaking up his chick.  But he broke up with her, so then Joe Rogan brings up a really good point.  Rogan just like, oh, this is the wrong thing to say.  But most people, as humans, you know, even though you're done with an X or whatever,  you don't really want to be visualizing them banging somebody else, you know?  Right.  And that would have been good enough, but Rogan's like just getting over the top.  Details.  The script.  Yeah.  Details.  You know, there's some guy, you know, bending her over a chair, and she used to be a chick. 
[00:42:00]  I heard about guerrilla sex.  Guerrilla sex.  Just more and more descriptive.  And then I have to add the final point, and I go, and Daniel, he's black.  Yeah.  And he was smiling and, like, kind of going with it and stuff, and we thought we had a  pretty good interview with him.  We were just having fun.  And then I guess on his block, he just, like, oh, he destroyed us.  Destroyed us on his block.  I guess he didn't have the balls to, you know, confront us live on the program yesterday. 
[00:42:30]  Kenny might have to deal with the problem back then.  Why?  What's the problem?  I don't know.  That guy's pointing over here.  He looks like a maintenance guy.  Oh, really?  Are we being loud?  Huh?  Leroy, see you later.  Jesus, Kenny.  Are you insane?  Well, I know the guy.  Oh, my God.  No, you don't.  You shouldn't be calling an Asian fellow by that name.  He should.  But I'm sure the ONA Army will go on this guy's blog and make a few comments.  Well, I just wish he had the balls to, you know, kind of confront us. 
[00:43:00]  Well, Ed Asner had no problem.  Ed Asner looked me right in the eye and says, I will never fucking do your radio program again.  Well, Ed Asner's known as a gruff guy and stuff like that.  Daniel Negreanu is a poker player.  He's a very nice guy.  Yeah.  He's, like, one of those very personable, very – he's got a good personality, nice guy.  He probably figured he would laugh and smile his way through to the end of it, get off, and then, like, oh, my God, I will never, you know, do that again. 
[00:43:30]  And he was probably taken aback a bit by some of Joe Rogan's and your comments, to tell you the truth.  Well, your girlfriend was saying that he was shaking after the interview.  Yeah, after the interview, she just spoke at him a little bit.  I shook his hand.  We went to break.  I'm like, hey, man, that was cool.  Thanks.  A little different, I know.  But, you know, thanks for being a good sport or whatever because I wasn't trying to kill him like I was trying to kill Ed Asner.  I thought we were all just on the same page having a little fun with it.  He was, yeah, shaking.  Shaking after the interview.  After the interview.  Speaking of which, going back a little bit, the Ed Asner thing, you know how I like to try to get people uncomfortable in the studio. 
[00:44:00]  That's one of my things.  But with Ed Asner, he was getting the best of me.  I had my poker face.  I do have a really good poker face, but not when I'm playing cards.  Not for poker.  Right.  I can't play the poker.  I'm looking at him, and we're going at it sort of.  If you're feeling the tension, my forehead started just dripping sweat.  I have never had that happen on the radio show before.  Really?  I'm like, oh, my God.  He's going to get the best of me.  He sees in my eyes that I'm crumbling here.  You know something? 
[00:44:30]  Someone, I just saw the phone screen up there.  Somebody is saying that you were calling yourself Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  During that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You son of a bitch.  I forgot to tell you that, yeah.  You son of a bitch.  I forgot.  Yeah, he hates you.  That's right.  Great.  So Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show is the idiot that was.  Yeah, I forgot to mention that part.  And what were you pointing at me, saying Opie's playing cards?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  You son of a bitch.  You said it 10 minutes ago.  Yesterday's show was all about just throwing people under the bus.  And it didn't matter if the person wasn't even here to defend himself. 
[00:45:00]  I wasn't even there.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot to tell you that.  I forgot.  Oh, thanks.  Great.  Nice that I know this now, just in case I ever bump into Ed Asner.  Yeah.  I'll say I'm Opie.  I forgot to tell you that.  Hey, can we say hi to Joe Rogan?  How do we do this?  Eric can do it back in New York.  Hey, Joe.  Yo.  Hey, what's up, Joe?  There he is.  What's up, guys?  How you doing, man?  Are you coming by today or what?  Yeah, I got a flood in my basement.  If I can make it out of here within an hour, definitely. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, you got to do a little more radio with us.  I would love to.  We got to take advantage of the fact that we're in L.A., man, because you were a lot of fun yesterday.  Did you hear what happened with Daniel after that interview?  Yeah, I read it online.  What a cunt.  What a little cunt that guy is.  He was laughing with us and choking around, and then he gets off, and oh, they were rude and vulgar.  What a little fucking bitch.  I cracked a little joke.  A little joke.  Dude, you were so graphic, and honestly, I don't care.  Everyone knows that, but I'm reading him a little bit. 
[00:46:00]  I'm like, all right, he's going with this.  This is fun, whatever.  And I just told Anthony, I don't know if you were listening, I hate people that don't confront  us back.  You know, he was going with it like it was all cool.  Well, that's not his style.  That's not his style.  He's, you know, more of the, you know, no conflicts with him.  He's a nice guy.  He's known as like a mama's boy kind of guy, and I think he was put in a position that  he didn't know how to deal with it, so he figured he'd just laugh his way through it  and then post on his blog how he was ripped apart as he sat down.  It was no big deal. 
[00:46:30]  I actually told him what I honestly feel.  Like, when I break up with a girl, the first thing I worry about is her getting just fucking  plowed by some other guy.  Of course.  That's like my biggest fear.  Who doesn't think of that?  What makes me think of that?  No, who doesn't think of that?  That's what I said.  Even though you're done with that person, you really just don't want to be visualizing  that.  That's one of the main reasons why I don't break up with chicks.  But Joe, you were like, you know, she's having gorilla sex.  It was amazing.  You were basically like. 
[00:47:00]  Did you bring up the fact that she might have taken it in the ass?  Oh, yeah.  It was like some other guy who has probably a bigger dick than you stretching around.  I'm like, Jesus, Joe, what's up?  Well, you know what?  That's what I think of.  I mean, that's what every guy thinks of.  Your worst nightmare is, you know, you tell, you go, you're never going to get better  than me, baby.  And then two nights later, she's getting stuffed into a corner of the couch.  Yeah.  Getting plowed.  And then I mentioned to the guy and picture that this guy's black and he just wasn't into  it anymore.  I'm trying to find.  Yeah, you want to go with the black angle. 
[00:47:30]  That's probably what tweaked him.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find what he wrote about us on his blog.  But Steve can't find it.  The race card.  Oh, you go to Wack Bag, man.  They had a whole discussion about it.  So it's on there.  But anyway, Joe, it was so much fun having you yesterday.  It was so much fun being there, man.  I definitely would like to come again.  And if I get out of here within the next...  I have a flood in my basement.  If I can get out of here within the next half hour, I'm coming down.  All right.  Well, it's not raining anymore.  It's not going to rain anymore out here.  There's still enough water.  My basement is under... 
[00:48:00]  It's like at the bottom of a hill.  And all the water from the ground has like seeped in from the months and months of rain.  It's really bad.  It's a map down there.  You guys are insane for living out here, man.  Oh, it's great.  Besides that, I mean, this is a bad year.  But other than that, it never rains.  And it's awesome.  Yeah.  And it's a lot of hot chicks.  Yeah.  Hold on, Joe.  Because we're trying to find the blog.  But you got it?  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  So, you know, he's talking about the tournament yesterday.  I'll read this word for word for everybody.  So, Daniel writes on his blog,  On the way out, I did the most disturbing interview I've ever done. 
[00:48:30]  Disturbing interview.  The most disturbing.  Ever.  Some satellite radio station asked me to do the show, so I obliged.  I sat in the chair and the radio host had no clue who I was and knew nothing about poker.  But we openly admitted that.  Remember, Joe?  We're like...  Yeah, it was a big deal.  We're like, oh, you're some famous...  All right, whatever, man.  But then we were impressed when he told us how much he won last year.  The only guy who knew who he was was sitting playing poker.  Yeah.  That was me.  We're not going to fake it. 
[00:49:00]  Of course.  I could care less, you know...  I understand.  ...about the guy.  They asked me a few questions and then went off on a vulgar exchange that was absolutely appalling.  I'm a poker player and they wanted to do his curse about nasty sex and random garbage.  I found the host to be extremely rude and vulgar, a welfare version of Howard Stern.  Welfare version.  I'm on welfare, Robin.  We were talking to the guy.  We were very complimentary of him.  And I said, look, congrats for having the balls to seek that out as a career. 
[00:49:30]  That's awesome.  You know, we were saying a lot of good things to him.  Just one thing.  You know, we were talking about...  He was talking about he broke up with his fiance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the Ed Asner thing will go down in history as one of the classic ONA moments.  He told you a destroyer.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Why a destroyer?  Because it was weird.  He was goofing around, sort of, but not really.  It was like a weird thing.  He was basically saying that I don't like people being happy. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I have to just make everyone uncomfortable.  Ed Asner's very perceptive.  Ed Asner's a very perceptive man at his age.  To be able to pick that up in no time.  Wow.  Hey, Joe.  Did you stop by the comedy store last night?  No, I didn't.  I had some shit I had to do.  They were teasing that you might be there last night.  We went there for a little while.  We saw, what's his name, the guy that's been on Johnny Carson the most that's there every  freaking night.  Every night for 40 years.  Oh, Argus?  Yeah, Argus was there, Anthony.  Yeah.  Argus was one of these old timers that used to do Carson all the time. 
[00:50:30]  And I think he's still thinking that he's going to be on Leno.  Wow.  He dresses up in his suit every night and does his hacky jokes.  It was just awful.  He's there for the farmers.  The farmers.  Farmer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The vacation, the tourists.  Yeah, there were a group of people from Kansas enjoying what he had to say.  There always is.  So, if I can get out of here within the next half hour, I'm definitely coming down.  All right, Joe.  Yeah, we'd love to see you again.  Go pump out your basement.  I had so much fun. 
[00:51:00]  It was awesome.  It was a blast.  Joe, I think we've got to talk.  I think things are going to be happening with our little channel here, and I think you need  to do a little more radio.  I would love to do it.  It sounds awesome.  Let's do it.  All right, Joe.  Thanks, Joe.  Thanks, guys.  Take it easy.  Later, man.  There it is.  Joe Rogan, everyone.  Heading to pump out his basement.  Yeah, so that was Daniel.  He just did not like us.  Yeah, wow.  I like that.  It's the most disturbing interview ever.  Ever.  That he's ever done.  And he was so pissed that we didn't know who he was.  Whatever. 
[00:51:30]  You know why?  It's at a poker thing.  You're funny.  He's so pissed that no one knew who he was, but, you know, whatever.  If we went to a radio event and no one knew who we were, we'd be a little miffed.  Just a little miffed.  But that ain't happening anymore.  But I'm saying if it did.  You're at a poker event.  So a fine couple that had sex at St. Pat's Cathedral, everyone knows who your pals Opie  and Anthony are.  You would probably be the first one, if we sat down to do an interview, and the guy said,  look, I have no idea who you guys were, you'd be the first one to go, whatever, dude. 
[00:52:00]  You would be so fucking pissed off.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, I have no clue who you are.  It would be instant attitude.  I don't know.  I guess it would.  I don't know, man.  The guy that we're at, a poker event, and he sits down to do an interview, and you guys  have no clue who he is.  No clue.  And he's like the top guy.  He's like the Michael Jordan of the sport.  I don't know.  I thought he was some scrub.  I don't know.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm just, you know, I understand what he walked into, but, you know, I'm not sitting here 
[00:52:30]  as his defender, but Jesus, you've got to understand.  It's kind of like, you know, we're at the NBA All-Star Game, broadcast live, and LeBron  James sits down.  Who are you?  What?  Who?  All right.  Who are you?  I guess you're making a good point.  He's not going to go, you know, screw you, man.  I'm disappointed in myself, though, because Jennifer Tilly sat down.  She's still very hot in the face, but her body just had all sorts of things happening.  Really?  And Rogan's just a pig.  He's just a pig when it comes to women, and we're both looking, and we're kind of critiquing 
[00:53:00]  her in front of her, because it's so loud, and if you don't have the headset on, so we're  saying stuff to each other.  I don't even know if it made the air, really, and then she's posing with Jim for photos,  and, you know, another time where Jim just decided he needed to leave the radio program.  Leave, of course.  And I just wish I could have commented on it.  She told me she's an Exxon listener.  She's got it in her car.  Yeah, she doesn't have it hooked up yet.  She just got it.  Oh, so you can say...  I'm kind of disappointed.  I didn't kind of go at her a little bit.  The gunt that Rogan... 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, did I make the air?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I heard earlier today.  She's taking...  Yeah, she's taking pictures, and I go, check that out.  He goes, yeah.  He goes, that's what we call a gunt.  I'm like, is that the West Coast term?  Because back East...  East Coast, we call it bunt.  Yeah, we call it bunt.  It's the belly area.  But he says gut.  Gut.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All righty.  Maybe do some real radio.  A lot of interesting things happening in the papers and stuff, and there's nothing happening  in this empty room.  The phones have come alive. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, you know what?  We haven't talked to our listeners in a couple days.  Maybe we'll do a few phone calls next.  And for some reason, the phones, at least with that last phone call, seem to work better  than when we're at the studio.  Right.  Because Joe Rogan was able to hear us, and we were able to hear him.  Oh, and people are asking for the Gangster Fag song.  Do we have that CD still?  Oh, you weren't around for this either?  I was around when Rogan came and showed us.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  And talked about what it was all about. 
[00:54:30]  Well, someone's going, what happened to Gangster Fag song?  We have to play that when we get back in New York.  Yeah, we don't have a CD place here.  We got it, and we'll play it on Monday's show when we're back in New York City.  But why don't we take a break?  It's the Opie and Anthony program broadcasting from the World Poker Tour at the Commerce Casino  in Los Angeles, California.  Broadcasting conversation from a locker room.  Everybody was drunk and having sex and shooting guns.  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  I'm ecstatic.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California. 
[00:55:00]  Be happy.  Be sad.  Be broke.  The virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  It's M202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  More human than human, more human than human, more human than human, more human than human, more human than human, more human than human, more human than human.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program live from the World Poker Tour at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles. 
[00:55:30]  That break was about what, a minute and a half?  Oh, plenty of time to do everything.  I like it. This is a lot more organized than it was yesterday, our setup here today.  You're not tripping over my headset wire behind you. Everything's taped down.  Yeah.  Very good job today. Yesterday was a little wacky when we first got in.  I love that type of radio, though. I love the chaos of it all.  Oh, yeah. Guerrilla radio.  This is kind of like, I don't know, we're sitting around waiting for things to happen, and we're professional broadcasters, so we will make things happen. 
[00:56:00]  Okay, here we go. Opie, what is this?  These are the people, can, can, can, is there an outside thing? No one can hear what I talk about. Okay.  These are the people that are coming in.  Yeah, they just opened a door in this.  To watch the poker on television in this room, Opie.  Look at the collection of farmers.  Yeah, these are the losers that couldn't get in the main room.  Right. So now they're going to sit here mere feet away from us and watch us do this freaking show until the TV comes on? 
[00:56:30]  And they're going to watch, uh, and then they're going to watch the...  For two fucking hours they're going to sit here?  And then they're going to watch the finals on TV later on.  Hey, can't we put on cartoons?  Well, look at them.  I don't think they have the brain capacity to watch anything else but cartoons.  This is going to be a room full of coolers that are just going to sit here.  And just stare at us.  Well, Kenny, get the wireless mic ready.  Oh, we're going to have to talk to a couple of these people. 
[00:57:00]  I've been so poker fan for my whole life.  Uh, let's say hi to Duke and New Jersey on line one as they let more of these zeros in.  Keep it a little...  Hello, zeros.  Uh, Duke, what's up?  Yo, man, what's up?  Great show yesterday. I love club to fuck shows.  Uh, thanks, Duke. We had fun.  Listen, that guy yesterday, the interview was going well, and it's a really douche move for him to go back and do that to you guys and post that out.  He was shocked. 
[00:57:30]  Well, you know what?  He could have defended himself right then, you know?  Yeah, I don't have respect for people like that.  I mean, you know, it's one thing.  He didn't enjoy the interview.  Decide, just go with it, and then, you know, end of the interview, he goes about his life, but then he went on his blog and then trashes us.  It's like, come on, dude.  Yeah.  No need for that. No need for that, because, you know what?  So, the guy wasn't probably plowing his life.  It's too bad, because I thought the guy was cool.  You know, I'm not going to lie to you.  I thought we were getting along, and it was kind of...  I thought we made $4 million playing cards.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Or I bought that $4 million playing goldfish. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  Oh, yeah, go ahead. Give yourself the car crash.  Yeah, thank you, Duke, because we don't have it here.  So, wow.  What are they doing?  They're bringing in...  Canada sucks.  Why?  Oh, that guy's got a...  Yeah, he has a Canadian t-shirt on.  They have to, like, register to come in here and all that stuff.  They have to register to come in?  They have, like, paperwork over there.  Are you kidding?  Release forms for the TV.  What?  To watch it?  Well, they're not going to show the...  They're not going to bring cameras in here. 
[00:58:30]  Well, I think they're doing anything they can to discourage these ugly people.  Maybe.  Here's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Maybe if some of the audience in that room has to leave...  Yes.  ...they fill the seats up with people out here.  You're absolutely right.  So, they fill out release forms, and then they can...  You're absolutely right.  But this is, like, the last room they're going to go to to get people from...  Holy crap.  Look at that guy.  Yeah.  This is...  I don't know.  We should get some...  Is this some kind of work release program they got set up today?  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:59:00]  He's got his name on his jacket.  Michael.  Anyway.  All right.  Extra from Goodfellas.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And that guy's guilty of something.  Yeah, you.  Yeah.  Not you.  You.  They're bringing more in.  Oh, my God.  Look at this old lady.  Oh, now the old ladies.  Hey, toots.  Sweet cheeks.  Kenny, know which one you got to do?  What?  Kenny has the best gag.  You know, we're walking...  Well, he didn't do it yesterday when we were all hanging out on Melrose, but we'll be walking 
[00:59:30]  down the street, and then he'll just yell as loud as he can.  Hey, tough guy.  Yeah.  Hey, tough guy.  And then he waits to see who's going to acknowledge that he's tough guy.  Who turns around, right?  And then the guy will turn around and see this monster of a man, Kenny, 6'5".  I've got to give somebody else credit for that line, though.  Who?  ADC.  ADC.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He used to do that?  That was originally his gag, yeah.  Wow.  Where did he steal it from?  Come on.  Through his people, I invited him on the program today. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, you were very gracious.  Oh.  I don't know if it's going to happen, but we'll see.  And what about, I heard tell maybe Jay Moore.  Who knows?  Jay Moore said he was coming by today.  I heard yesterday it was a definite.  He has no excuses.  We're not doing morning radio.  We're in L.A.  It's afternoon.  There's no excuse for Jay not to be here.  Right.  Why don't we say hi to Vanilla Thunder?  He's calling from California, Anthony.  Vanilla Thunder, what's going on today, bro?  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[01:00:30]  Hey.  Hi, Club Soda.  Oh, you're a fan of mine?  I'm a big fan.  I was questioning you.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Can I stop you for one second?  I just thought of something.  Yeah.  You know how we've been trying out news people and stuff?  Mm-hmm.  Kenny's one of the guys that the listeners like the most as far as a newsreader goes.  Yeah, yeah, Kenny.  Did a great job.  And, you know, we're trying to fill time here until, you know, maybe we get some celebrities  and some action happening on the program.  Kenny, would you like to do some news today?  You want me to prepare some news? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, that'd be good.  All right, give me a few minutes and I'll be right back.  I like how he can just do it on the road.  Can you check out the rumor that California will take the back of Ben's legs?  Old gravy legs.  Old gravy legs.  All right, I'm punching out.  It's finally sunny out here.  It's not going to rain anymore.  And I hear in New York it started snow or something like that.  They got some snow.  Like six to eight inches is happening in New York City.  Yeah, I told Kenny to prepare news so he would just take his headset off and shut up for a while.  And go into a corner somewhere.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Anthony. 
[01:01:30]  So, yeah, we tooled around Melrose after the show and you were exhausted from playing poker.  I was mentally and physically exhausted, Opie.  I had to go back to the room.  I had a couple of beers, kicked back, got some room service, and me and the girly watched.  That's what you do when you're on the road.  You turn into Howard Hughes.  I kind of, you know what it was?  Do you actually tell people that you were in a certain location?  Like, you're going to go home and go, yeah, we had a great time in California.  Shouldn't you just say we had a great time in the hotel?  I go out. 
[01:02:00]  I'll go out tonight.  All right.  Yesterday, I was shot, man.  You know how it sounds all dramatic and stuff, but you get really exhausted when you're in a situation where you're really nerve-wracked.  And the pressure and stress and stuff like that, you get tired.  So, I went back to the room.  I didn't even make it past 8.30.  We watched that movie Saw.  Have you seen that one yet?  Saw?  Yeah.  Like a horror movie?  No, never even heard of it.  It wasn't bad.  It was pretty good.  A little creepy.  I liked it.  So, I watched that and got some room service and then I just passed out.  I was done. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Gone.  And then I kept waking up.  Like 10 o'clock, I woke up and then 2 in the morning and racing through my head was, maybe I should have went all in on that Ace 5.  Maybe I should.  Like, it just goes through your mind.  I can't imagine how some of these pros that really play this all the time deal with that stuff.  Because it wasn't my money, you know.  If I had put up 25 large to sit at that table, I really would have been thinking about it.  And I can't imagine having done that and then been out within 5 minutes and then have it replay in your head until the next tournament. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Weren't you watching the strongman competition on ESPN?  Yeah.  Well, that's one point in the night.  I think it was probably 1 in the morning or so.  I woke up, turned on ESPN and they had the strongman competition.  And I was watching that.  It was from the Bahamas, from Atlantis in the Bahamas.  Nice setting.  And I was just watching these guys and all I kept thinking of was the Brian Regan bit.  You know that one where he's like, and they're throwing pianos up into the third floor window.  And I'm just watching going, that doesn't have to be there. 
[01:03:30]  Put that down.  Well, that's the weird thing about the strongman competition.  You know, you get these gorillas and it's not good enough to just have them lift a lot of weights that you would find in a traditional gym.  They have to make it interesting for TV.  So they're lifting just ridiculous looking objects.  They're pulling like, I don't know, boats and stuff.  Trains, things like that.  Trains, right.  Well, last night I'm watching and they had one competition where they had to pick up, they had taken two motorcycles, I'm talking big bikes, and welded a pipe across the two of them. 
[01:04:00]  And the guy had to pick up the motorcycles and then walk a certain distance.  And you see their legs shaking and their whole body is like quaking.  And they're, I got that face on where every vein is popping out of their head.  And they can't even move their feet.  And their feet are going like two inches at a time trying to get across this line.  And you're watching going, ah, how the, and you're hoping to just see a kneecap pop out and go about 50 yards. 
[01:04:30]  And hit some bitch in the forehead.  They were, they were welded, they welded another bar on safes, big iron safes.  And they had to lift these things up and carry them a certain distance.  Then they had the boulder basket where they had a big basket that was connected on a huge pipe that had a pivot point in the middle.  And they'd have to pick up this basket and walk in a circle with this huge basket full of boulders.  And it's the same thing.  And I'm amazed some of the guys can really do it.  And other guys can't get 10 feet and they all look the same. 
[01:05:00]  They got their huge leg muscles, huge arm muscles.  And you wonder what makes it so some of these guys can do it and others can't.  Steroids.  Yeah, the roids, the roids.  But it's so funny to watch.  And then I'm laying there, you know, exhausted, like, I can't watch this anymore.  These guys, they're making me tired.  That's cool.  Sick show, yeah.  So I woke up a couple times during the night.  But then I'm ready tonight, though.  I'm ready to go out.  We've got to do something cool tonight. 
[01:05:30]  Excuse me.  We went to Barney's Beanery last night.  World famous Barney's Beanery.  It's on Fountain, I think.  It's pretty close to it.  I never heard of it.  Well, you should know it.  It's the last place that Janis Joplin drank before she died.  Oh, well, then I should.  I still have to.  I learned that when we did the Graveline tour one year when we came out to L.A.  Is that thing still going?  Dude, last time I was out here about a year ago.  And it's my favorite thing to do.  I did it like two or three years in a row when we were doing a lot of broadcasts from L.A. 
[01:06:00]  Basically, you meet on a corner in the middle of Hollywood, down near Man's Chinese Theater or whatever.  And they throw you in a hearse.  And, you know, I mean, Los Angeles is all about these stupid bus tours.  Here's a name, very famous person.  Oh, yeah.  And you don't even know.  They just pull up to mansions and go, yeah, that's where Sly Stallone lives.  And yesterday he was out here getting his paper when we drove by.  And you just got to believe the bus driver.  You have no idea that this actual home is this big celebrity they're claiming it is. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  You know, like, Charlton Heston lives here.  And you just got to believe the bus driver or whatever.  But it was called Graveline Tours.  And you get in a hearse.  And the guy had such a great sense of humor.  Usually you're in the hearse with a bunch of, like, goth chicks.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because they're all about death and destruction.  Got their vampire teeth in.  And then they drive all over, like, Los Angeles area and show you places where famous people, like, died.  Really?  And the first one you're on, is Sunset the one that goes in front of Man's Chinese Theater? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, Ben?  I guess.  I don't know.  Or it might be Hollywood Boulevard or it doesn't matter.  Whatever.  But the tour starts.  We get out of light a couple blocks from where they picked us up.  And they're like, right on this corner, Fred Mertz dropped dead of a heart attack.  Fred Mertz?  Yeah.  Coming out of some movie premiere.  Really?  I didn't know that's how he bought it.  And just right there on the corner.  Yeah.  You're waiting for a red light.  Now no one gives a crap because it's so many years later. 
[01:07:30]  People are walking with their Starbucks and trying to cross the road with their cheap T-shirts to bring back home.  But that's where Fred Mertz dropped dead.  Right there on the corner.  Wow.  And for, I don't know, for some reason I find this completely fascinating.  Fascinating stuff.  And then, like, didn't they stop by this really kind of creepy house and it was, like, the Good Witch from The Wizard of Oz?  Yes, Glenda.  Glenda.  She started getting really, really old and she didn't want to live anymore.  Uh-huh.  So she, I think she was in her 80s or something.  Yeah.  You know, these stories go back two or three years so maybe I don't have all the details. 
[01:08:00]  But basically she was getting up there in years and just didn't want to, you know, die of old age.  Right.  So one day she decides to put on her, you know, her best, like, cocktail dress that she probably wore at a lot of Hollywood parties.  Oh, when she was all hot.  Yeah, movie premiered.  Getting banged by Clark Gable.  She proceeds to get her makeup just right.  Yes.  And then she places a plastic bag on her head.  Oh.  And ties it nice and tight around her neck and she kills herself this way. 
[01:08:30]  What a horrific find that must have been.  And I'm like, cool, where are we going next?  Oh.  And there was everything from, like, where Marilyn Monroe was found.  John Belushi, they do the.  Oh, yeah, the John Belushi thing.  Actually, that's where we should go.  Really?  That's great for celebrity sightings.  Chateau, whatever, Marmont or whatever.  You go in the back, that's where the celebrities hang out, man.  Really?  Yeah, there's a great little bar back there.  The cocktails are excellent.  And celebrities, you know, that's where they go to drink and stuff.  I think how annoyed Jimmy would be if we came back with the celebrity photos that he missed 
[01:09:00]  because he had a gig today.  Yeah, last time I was in L.A., I was back there and the real tall chick from Third Rock from  the Sun was there.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I forgot her name.  And then you're forgetting the huge celebrity we saw last night at the restaurant, one of  the guys from the real world.  Yeah, real world.  Which one?  Real world Las Vegas.  And also Barry Sobel walking outside.  I mean, you just walk L.A. and you see celebrities all over the place, especially this week because  of the Oscars or whatever.  Right.  So then the tour continues. 
[01:09:30]  And for some reason, they wouldn't take us by, you know, where O.J. did his thing.  Why not?  That was off limits for some reason.  Probably the neighborhood.  And then we're driving through, like, Beverly Hills and they're showing, like, where Bugsy  Siegel used to live and this and that.  And I started noticing that all the locals in Beverly Hills just beeping their horns and  giving the finger to the hearse.  Really?  Because on the side, it says Graveline Tours, the phone number and stuff.  They don't like that.  They hated this tour. 
[01:10:00]  And maybe they finally got it shut down with some stupid wacky law or something.  I don't know.  Oh, it's not around anymore?  No, because like I said, I was out here last year.  I wanted to go on it again.  I was turning people on to this tour forever.  It sounds like something fun to do.  Yeah, anyone that would come out to Los Angeles.  I'm like, you've got to do the Graveline Tour.  It's amazing.  And I'm trying to remember some of the other just really interesting ones.  There was one more.  Anyway, all right.  Well, getting back to Barney's Beanery, we pulled up front of that.  And I guess that's where Jazz Joplin was drinking, you know, the night before they found 
[01:10:30]  her dead.  A million years ago.  And also, I guess, Zeppelin used to hang out there when they were in town, things like  that.  And it was just a cool little, you know, bar.  And we ate there last night and had some beer.  They had beer from all over the world.  And then Kenny was telling his racist jokes to Jay.  And Jay was laughing his ass off.  And, you know.  Yeah, I had some Vietnam beer.  It was pretty good.  Vietnam beer, huh?  Yeah.  Nice.  And then went to the comedy store and saw Jay London and a few guys and called it a night.  I heard Jimmy had some fun last night, too. 
[01:11:00]  Got to get him on the phone.  Yeah, we're trying to call him right now.  We keep trying.  He made a little faux pas, I guess.  Wait, what happened?  But he went to Jerry's Diner, which is a couple blocks from our hotel.  Yeah.  And he ran into Forrest Whitaker, which he had his photo.  But then there was another guy that he called the wrong name.  Steve will know the answer.  But, of course, you know, Jim got his photos.  Yeah, Jim always on the prowl for the photos.  So I guess he's at this diner.  He was at a diner down the street from the hotel. 
[01:11:30]  And I guess he saw David Keith.  David Keith.  Now, we remember David Keith from An Officer and a Gentleman.  He's the guy that hung himself.  In the closet.  Yeah, in the closet.  And he was there.  He's been in a lot of stuff now, too.  You see him pop up in, like, the new Outer Limits episodes and things like that.  He was in Daredevil.  You know, fairly recognizable guy.  Yeah.  And Jimmy walks up to him and says,  Excuse me, Mr. Swayze, can I have your autograph?  He calls him Mr. Swayze.  Well, because he panics.  Yeah.  He is the worst.  For someone who loves pictures with celebrities, he is the worst at it. 
[01:12:00]  Because he doesn't know their names.  He's all awkward.  He looks like a stalker.  He turns into a little kid.  Yeah.  He just panics.  Oh, Mr. Swayze.  Swayze?  How do you mix that guy up with Patrick Swayze?  You shouldn't.  Ever.  They're totally different people.  That's Jimmy, though.  That's Jimmy.  And then he got a Forrest Whitaker?  I guess Yoshi was saying they hung around.  They were milling around the diner.  They all wanted to leave, but Jimmy would not leave until Forrest Whitaker got up and left.  So he could accost him.  It's a nightmare.  I mean, the whole Metallica thing I went through that we've talked about on the air, it's a nightmare. 
[01:12:30]  It's not even fun.  What if you want to leave?  You can't.  Because he drives to make sure that you can't leave.  Oh, so then he drives.  You're stuck with him.  I was stuck at the Meadowlands, whatever they call that place these days.  Continental Airlines.  Yeah, and yeah, like for two hours after the show.  What an ass.  Dumbest move ever.  Jim's like, oh, I'll drive.  I'll drive.  No problem.  You know, we were figuring out how to get to the Metallica concert, and sure enough, we were there.  We walked out of the arena with Metallica because Jim had to wait to get Lars' photo. 
[01:13:00]  That's why I don't let anyone else drive.  I go.  I go where I want to go when I want to go.  That's little Jimmy's way of making himself feel better about himself is taking these pictures.  Right.  And it's an obsession with him, as demonstrated yesterday, because he just forfeited the show at many points just to get these pictures.  It was just ridiculous.  Yoshi brought us some porn?  Yes.  Did you guys get to direct that porno last night?  No, of course not, because yet again, this porno chick flaked out.  A flaky porno chick. 
[01:13:30]  Big surprise.  Yeah, wow.  An independable porno girl.  The kick-ass was paying her, too.  I mean, there was no reason for her to bail, and she completely bailed out.  But we do have that whole vag pump, that vacuum pump that I'm lining up girls that are interested in trying it out.  We're going to have girls doing the vag pump when we get back to New York?  When we get back to New York, yes.  Oh, the one that makes it all swollen?  Yeah, yeah.  Makes it look like a monkey's ass.  Yeah, looks like a baboon.  Baboon, a mandrel ass.  Like a mandrel, yeah, I was thinking mandrel. 
[01:14:00]  Mandrel ass.  Look at this DVD we got called Ripe, Opie.  What's with that chick is fat?  Maybe that's why ripe.  She's all big and bruised.  Like a big, ripe banana.  Yeah, she looks awful.  Absolutely awful.  But, you know, there's porno.  There's porno for everybody.  That's right.  Could he have given us one that hasn't been watched a hundred times?  Hey, Yosh.  Jesus, look at all the scratches on this one, Yosh.  Scratches or crust?  Scratches, unless they were, you know. 
[01:14:30]  You know what people do after they are.  Unless the porn chicks were, you know, cutting their lines on the back of this.  Is it scratched?  Is it scratched up?  It'll work.  It should be working fine.  Yeah, it'll work.  Don't worry.  Take a look.  Yoshi, you're the man.  Wow, yeah.  This has been useful.  The guy just keeps bringing us porn after porn after porn.  I have a pile of porn at my apartment.  I've watched one of the movies.  I've got a hundred.  Oh, you've got to watch all of them.  That's the gay one of breath with Noah, because it's gone now.  We each have.  Oh, there's a gay one.  We each have face fuckers.  That's gay.  A bunch of discs. 
[01:15:00]  That's gay.  And it's gay?  That's good stuff.  Let me see mine.  And then, which one?  Just fucking.  This one?  Yeah, face fuckers.  Thank you.  Here, I'll take care of Anthony.  Fresh meat.  Oh, that one's a good one.  Thanks, Kenny.  Fresh meat 19.  Yeah.  Oh, to that.  And then, um...  Euro domination.  Euro domination, too.  I'm not into the dominatrix.  I'll take fresh meat.  Well, we'll bring the porno back to New York and edit our collection, so... 
[01:15:30]  There's also a...  He brought a shopping bag the other day when Jimmy and I were hanging out with him.  Put little kids in in bathroom stalls?  Exactly.  It's got to be twice the size of any regular supermarket shopping bag, and it is filled to  the brim with porn and porn magazines and DVDs, and thank you.  It's fantastic.  We love our smut.  We certainly do.  All right, well, we don't have much action here today, unfortunately.  No, no.  We're in this weird back room, and we're waiting for the festivities to begin.  Hopefully, some celebrities will stop by and say hi. 
[01:16:00]  Kenny's working on his newscast.  Yep.  He's just about done.  I'm looking forward to.  Kenny, you didn't look at the New York paper, though.  No, that was the first one I did.  I got the headline news.  You got the headline news?  All right, very good.  Wacko Jacko.  Is Wacko Jacko in your newscast?  Oh, yeah.  He's the top story of today.  All right.  You got the top stories, Michael Jackson.  That's good.  We'll do it after the break, I think, unless you're...  Yeah, I want you to practice a little bit.  I want you to practice.  Spontaneous.  All right.  And, Ben, who do we have stopping by? 
[01:16:30]  Vince Van Patten's coming over pretty soon, too.  Let's talk about more poker.  He's finishing up TV.  Let's talk about what's going on with the final table today.  Kenny got him with a drop something pretty bad on the way into the building.  He mistook me for a poker player.  Yeah, he thought Kenny was one of the guys at the final table.  He goes, hey, you finally made it.  Yeah, he goes...  And Kenny's like, yeah, why?  Yeah, you made it.  Wow.  All shocked and stuff.  And then we got Lemmy from Motorhead coming in.  Lemmy from Motorhead.  Supposed to be here.  Also got the gang that does the clown porn. 
[01:17:00]  We got the clown porn guy supposed to be stopping by.  We might get Billy Zabka, the blonde guy from Karate Kid, is supposed to be stopping by as well.  Stop it.  I'm serious.  Oh, my goodness.  Cue off the Karate Kid music.  Wow.  Breaking out all the A-list celebrities for the Opie and Anthony program today, huh?  That's right.  Jesus.  Shot our wad yesterday.  My God.  Oh, Rogan might come, too.  No, I know.  Rogan.  That's funny.  Knowing Joe, he's on his way because the guy just can't get enough of this satellite radio.  He loves it.  Can't get enough.  Well, this is the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:17:30]  It's like one day, it's just an amazing, chaotic cluster F, and the next day, we're sitting  in a room waiting for stuff to happen.  Every day is amazing.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thanks, Kenny.  What about getting Kenny to interview some of these rooms that are sitting there?  Well, once we get this room filled up a little more, yeah.  I'm going to interview Michael over there.  Once they sit down.  Yeah, why don't you talk to Michael, Kenny, before we go to break.  See what he's about.  Yeah?  Okay.  Here I go.  Oh, jeez.  Jesus, Kenny.  He's very eager to please, Kenny. 
[01:18:00]  He drops everything.  Testing.  Is this working?  That's working, Kenny.  Identify yourself and get him.  All right.  Here goes Club Soda Kenny.  He's in the back of the room.  Excuse me, fellas.  I'm Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony show, XM Satellite Radio.  Can I ask you guys what you're doing here today?  I came to watch the show.  And what's your excuse?  I came here to make some money gambling.  Really?  You look like a fucking loser.  Listen, where are you from?  I think I'm from my mom. 
[01:18:30]  Originally?  No, secondhand.  All right.  Look.  Listen, what's your name, Michael?  Uh, you're not too bright, are you?  No.  You know I'm big and stupid.  Where are you from?  Memphis, Tennessee.  You got a nice suntan.  Did anybody ever tell you that?  Speak, it's radio, stupid.  I think I'm falling into something here.  You think?  No, I've never had that comment before.  Say hello to everybody over there.  Hi, Mom.  All right.  Thank you, Michael.  All right.  Thanks, fellas. 
[01:19:00]  Good luck here today.  Wait, what is he saying?  Yeah, thanks.  What was he saying?  He told me to keep my day job.  Well, I don't disagree with him.  Let's say hi to Bob on the phones, Anthony, before we go to break here.  Jesus, I'm mortified.  What happened?  Oh, Vince is coming over, too?  Good.  Here comes Vince.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Bob.  Bob, Bob, Bob.  What's up, man?  Bob, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, uh, hey, I'm Opie and Anthony.  I just talked to, uh, just listening to Sean Hannity. 
[01:19:30]  And, uh, people are apparently firing him up about your little conversation with Ed Asner yesterday.  Oh, really?  Well, because Ed Asner was on the program yesterday saying how much he hates Sean Hannity.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he's, uh, he's a puppet for the, uh, Republican Party, something like that.  Not a big fan.  He said mannequin.  And I go, Ed, what's a mannequin?  I was just being a dick.  I'm a puppet.  And, uh, and we defended...  Ed Asner is the biggest friggin' place in the world.  We defended, uh, Sean Hannity.  We said that, uh, we don't necessarily agree with his politics. 
[01:20:00]  All of us, anyway.  Yeah.  Uh, but, uh, we like the guy.  I know, and, uh, he's actually gonna be looking, I guess, to call you guys and get a copy of the tape.  But, uh, because apparently he's been trying to get Ed Asner on.  Because apparently he gets people on there all the time that, you know, don't share his views and pretty much makes them look like asses because they're willing to come on.  But, uh, I don't know if this is the one he's gonna get.  Yeah.  Uh, well, I mean, I don't know if Sean's gonna want to play our interview with Ed Asner.  I think he does a different, uh, a different show than us, so. 
[01:20:30]  All right, thanks, Bob.  We got Vince here.  That was, uh, a who cares phone call.  Vince.  Vince, there he is.  Vince Van Patten.  Yep.  Oh, yeah, we got the list right here.  There it is.  Table position and everything.  You're all showered and ready to go.  We saw you as we were getting here.  You were in your sweats.  It looked like you just worked out.  Needed a shower.  You know, I woke up, I played a little poker last night, and then I woke up and, uh,  needed to get a workout, so I ran around the casino. 
[01:21:00]  But this is a tough neighborhood, so you don't want to go too far away.  Right, right.  So I was running around the parking lot.  And that's when you saw me, sweating.  Yeah, we talked about, uh, the location of this place yesterday.  Yeah.  A little scary.  It is.  And we got lost on the way over yesterday, and, uh, Kenny was our driver, and, and he  pulls over to ask for directions.  I'm like, how stupid are you?  All the signs are in Spanish at this point.  I know, but I just want to say, Vince looked good old hot and sweaty.  Hey, but you know what?  If you're a poker player, you know, who goes outside, okay? 
[01:21:30]  That's true.  You can be trapped in here for five months.  Right.  You know, who sees the blue of the sky?  The actions inside the casino.  How did you wind up doing yesterday?  Well, you know, I played the Invitational.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  So many celebrities and the top poker players of the world.  I mean, it was like a freak show, putting them together.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know who was crashing whose party, but everyone had a good time.  Long story short, I finished about 50th out of about 200.  Yeah, that's not bad at all.  You know, it doesn't matter, because if you don't make the money as a poker player, who  cares? 
[01:22:00]  Right.  You know, if you're 10th and you don't collect, you're more irritated than if you got knocked  out first or second.  How'd you get knocked out?  Uneventful hand.  Really?  When you get whittled down, the blinds get so big.  It was like five and 10,000.  What are the blinds?  That's what happened to me.  Automatic bets you have to put in before you look at your cards.  And as the tournament goes on, they increase in size so that it doesn't, people can't  just wait for a perfect hand.  So you're forced for action.  So the blinds got so big.  The action was so big.  I just came in with 6'4".  I had to, because I had no money left.  Right. 
[01:22:30]  And I got grinded away.  I didn't get lucky.  Bounced out.  But, you know, they got two celebs in there.  I mean, VIP, Mr. Buffer's in there today.  Yep.  You know, and Tom Everett Scott.  Michael Buffer?  His brother.  Michael Buffer.  Michael Buffer's brother.  And he's a great announcer himself.  He's going to say, let's get ready to play some cards.  Yes.  Oh, good one, Kenny.  Jesus.  I didn't want to over-modulate.  Good.  Good.  You did a fine job in broadcasting that one.  Thank you.  Yeah, so he's a sort of celebrity.  Yeah, he is.  And then, you know, he got to, you know, he would be VIP. 
[01:23:00]  You think you can bring him over for an interview?  Probably, you know.  Now, Tom Everett Scott, he was in that American Werewolf in Paris or something movie.  He's been on a few shows.  And he made it to the final table.  That's a pretty big thing for one of the celebrities.  Let me tell you something.  All the pros like to stick around and, like, wink at each other and go, hey, you know what?  We're all going to make it to the final table.  The celebrities can't do it.  Every year, celebrities have gotten in there.  Yeah.  And it's because there's a lot of luck in poker.  In a one-tournament-style game, there's a lot of luck. 
[01:23:30]  Anyone can get lucky.  And, you know, the celebrity proved it.  Do you know how Cameron Manheim did?  Because I know she was doing very well at the table I was at early on.  She took out a few guys, had a nice stack in front of her.  And I don't just mean her belly and boobs.  But, look, I know that's a little.  Kenny, why'd you say that?  I'm sorry.  Vince is looking at you.  He wants to say, I guarantee it.  But, you know.  That's okay.  And how did she do to you?  Cameron, I think, you know, got bounced out. 
[01:24:00]  But I don't know.  Bounced out.  Is that a joke?  But I guess.  I guess.  But I don't know exactly where she finished.  Okay.  But it was impressive.  There was a lot of stars there yesterday.  A lot of fun.  Very good.  You know.  I got knocked out, I guess, pretty early in the game.  But it was a lot of fun.  It was my first tournament.  I had a great time.  But, you know, there's only so much you can do when you're sitting there with professionals like that.  Did you feel intimidated by them?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  There's no, you know, I'm sitting there and Phil Gordon is treating me like his bitch. 
[01:24:30]  And, you know, how am I going to turn that around?  It just ain't going to happen.  You know?  Yeah.  That guy is forget about it.  Did he make the final table?  No, he didn't.  He got knocked out.  Obviously, he didn't.  But he's just another bum the next day.  Yeah.  That's it.  Chris Ferguson.  Good to see him at the final table.  A world champion, Chris Ferguson.  You know, he hasn't made a final table since he has short hair, though.  You know, and now he has hair down here.  But it's great to see him in a world poker tour final table.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Brilliant champion.  People love this guy.  Alex Bennis, also in there, of the Bennis brothers.  They're a great poker playing family.  Um, let's see.  Who's your pick?  Who do you think is going to go?  You know, you usually go with the chip leader, Johan Sorakas from Sweden.  Has the most chips at this point.  But I'm going to take a shot.  I think Chris Ferguson is going to get lucky.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to go for.  You know, kind of the favorite.  Now, Chan Chang is a guy that plays in the biggest side games in the world. 
[01:25:30]  He'll play in games where you win or lose a half a million to a million dollars a day in the side games.  Really?  Yeah.  In fact, he was playing this event.  Where do you play these side games?  They're going on in the Commerce Casino right now.  No kidding.  Yeah, I was walking through that room and it's, oof.  Some of those guys are playing for major bucks downstairs?  Oh, yeah, you've got Phil Ivey and Gus Hansen down there playing and Doyle Brunson playing for a half a million to a million dollars a day.  It's insane.  And Chan is one of these guys that he was in the tournament and he was just saying, hey, I'm doing pretty well.  But the side games going on downstairs, I can make millions in that. 
[01:26:00]  So he tried to dump off his hand and lose, but he got lucky with it and he's made the final table.  He's kind of bummed.  I guess so.  But then if you make the final table, it's on TV.  Yeah, yeah.  It makes up for it.  It helps your exposure.  It gets your exposure, your popularity, and then all of a sudden you're doing endorsement deals and stuff.  But guys are really playing for that much down there in that cheap-looking casino?  Yeah, they really are.  And right now, if you go down there right now, you'll see Gus Hansen and Phil Ivey, they're head-to-head.  They're playing heads-up in a game where you play for $4,000 and $8,000 bets each card. 
[01:26:30]  Wow, that's pretty interesting.  That's hardcore, heavy-duty, man.  Yeah.  Very cool.  How's your famous family doing?  We're not quite as famous as we used to be, but a few decades ago we were a little more famous.  But, no, we're all doing well, healthy, thank God.  We weren't going to bring that up.  My father, Dick Van Patten, still playing tennis.  He's 76.  He's still acting.  He still plays tennis in the morning.  Jumps in the ice-cold pool and then goes to the racetrack in the afternoon.  So he's very happy.  He keeps his pool ice-cold? 
[01:27:00]  Ice-cold, yes.  Wow.  Gets the sweat, jumps in the pool.  He thinks that's, you know, it is great for him.  Gee.  Yeah, but you can't have fun in your pool.  He does.  Not about fun.  He does, though.  But then you've got the racetrack after, so he's doing great.  Yeah.  Yeah, everyone's doing well, thanks.  Any more of those?  Yeah, I remember watching a few of the late 70s, early 80s, some of your movies there.  Horror-slasher movies that you're in?  Thank you, yes.  What do I do?  I'm trying to remember the name of one.  The one where a group of young people hanging out in the mansion.  A very original story.  You're describing every horror movie. 
[01:27:30]  Exactly.  But you're right.  I bet you someone died.  Hell Night, my friend.  Hell Night, that was the one.  Linda Blair, myself, and the other.  Right, right.  And guess who was on the set as a grip?  Came up to me and said, oh, Vince, you know, it's nice to meet you.  I just want to get in the acting field.  I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chris Jesus Ferguson.  No, Kevin Costner.  Kevin Costner.  Working on Hell Night as a grip, and the rest is history.  A young Kevin Costner.  Wow.  Great guy.  Nice guy.  How did you bite it in that movie?  I was like the third one to go.  No, the fourth one to go. 
[01:28:00]  And I just got, you know, every movie's like that.  But I just, I thought I had them, and I got all excited, and then wham!  They did something horrible.  I think it was an ice pick or something.  Did you used to do a bunch of those, like, Battle of the Network stars things, too?  We did a couple of those, you know, our family did.  I remember your dad was always involved in those things.  Yeah.  And those were always, and Lou Ferrigno is trying to get the canoe across the thing, and then  here comes, you know, the guy from Chips, and that's great.  Yeah.  They're the fun show to do. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  There should be a comeback of that type of show.  There certainly should, right?  Yeah.  You're a little busy hosting this, though.  Yeah.  Very popular, man.  This has really taken off.  It's fun.  We travel the world on the World Poker Tour.  Vince, I got to tell you something.  I don't get the whole watching the final table on this TV from the venue.  Now, here's the problem, is that you're not going to see the cards today.  You know, they hold it off.  Wow.  Everyone gets to see the cards.  That's rough.  So it's a big difference.  If you were seeing the card, you guys would really be happy.  I mean, you'd be seeing it, you'd be saying, hey, I could do that. 
[01:29:00]  I love the show.  When you don't see the cards, it's not quite as usual.  But these people are going to sit in this room to watch it on TV.  I don't get that.  Because they're degenerates.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Finally someone honest on our program.  I love it.  I'm one of them.  I'm one of them.  That's what we were saying.  We're not watching the cards.  We were saying, look at these people coming in to watch poker on TV.  So we're not going to know.  While they're doing the actual event live next door.  We're not going to know when a hand is folded, if they were bluffing or...  You're not going to see the bluffs unless they show it.  Yeah, but they're not going to do that. 
[01:29:30]  But it's still great.  If you love poker and you understand it and you're seeing moves and you're watching on TV  and these guys are getting a fan base behind them, it could be really thrilling.  When is this going to air?  It's not going to air for four years.  Four years.  We'll look forward to that.  And it's about four months away.  Four months?  Four months.  Yeah, about four months away.  Well, the new season's kicking off March.  Yeah, the beginning of March.  I'm getting a March.  Wednesday night at 9, World Poker Tour.  It's a great new third season.  I'm psyched.  I love it.  I watch it all the time.  I never really watched it before, but after broadcasting here for the last couple of days, 
[01:30:00]  I'll definitely take a peek now.  And it was so cool to get my feet wet in the first tournament like that.  It was so much fun.  It was so exciting to be there.  You know, as a fan watching your show on TV all the time, to then be dropped in the middle of it  and playing and turning your head and seeing people.  You know, Annie Dukes is sitting next to me right there.  It's insane.  Where else does that happen?  Do you get hooked a little bit?  He's got the bug.  What are you kidding?  I'm totally hooked.  We were talking earlier.  I mean, he's done now.  Yeah.  Every weekend. 
[01:30:30]  On Monday, the show's going to start.  So where were you over the weekend, Anthony?  I was at the poker tournament and wherever, you know.  They need some to hold.  He gets his money and I'm that guy.  You could be that man.  But we do 17 tournaments a year.  Wow.  Where are you guys located usually?  New York.  New York.  Oh, yeah.  I know that town.  Yeah.  You guys.  Small place.  We play on Atlantic City, you know.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Let's see our faces again.  I'll put up half the money and you put up the other half.  I like it.  I like it.  Bravo.  Thank you, Vince.  All right, Vince.  Thank you.  Good seeing you.  Good seeing you.  We're not supposed to clap. 
[01:31:00]  We got trouble for clapping before.  Vince, thanks, man.  Thank you, Vince.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live.  Thank you, Vince, for the World Poker Tour.  And, Ben, what do we got?  I see Mark Teich has entered the building.  Yes.  Stephen Lynch is a buddy there who helps Stephen Lynch on a lot of his songs and stuff.  He's, you know, famous in his own right.  I understand that.  He's the fly.  Come on.  He's the fly in the Bacardi commercials.  Really?  Yeah.  You ever see the fly that flies around, buzzes, and lands on the ceiling and is looking at 
[01:31:30]  the chicks in the room?  He's the fly.  He's the fly.  He's the fucking fly, man.  I love that.  And he brought a couple of musicians with him.  Cool.  Some guys that do some really funny songs, right?  You're going to do what?  One or two?  How many do you want to do?  What?  All right.  They're just doing sign language.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll figure this out.  Yes, we will.  And I think when we come back also, we've got Club Soda Kenny doing the news.  Live from Los Angeles, California.  Ben trying to keep Kenny from making noises with his headset. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, because you drop it, Kenny.  Kenny picks it up.  It sounds like Edward Scissorhands putting on a headset.  You can't slap that thing around, Kenny.  I'm not good at this.  No, you're not.  Hey, as we go to break, I don't know if Eric, who's back in snowy New York.  Eric, by the way, it's 65 and sunny, and it's going to be beautiful all weekend.  Oh, I know.  Great forecast.  Los Angeles.  So nice.  Enjoy the snow.  Good luck getting back to Brooklyn tonight.  And we're off for the next, you know, until we're done until we have to get back on the air Monday.  So we're going to be hanging out here in LA for a while. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, just taking it all in.  Nice sunny weather.  Why don't we play a song that Mark Tyke does with Stephen Lynch?  I got it.  You got it, Eric?  All set.  Eric, is it snowing?  Yeah.  Enjoy Los Angeles.  A little cold out there, huh?  Just a bit.  Yeah.  How much snow on the ground, would you say?  Not even half an inch yet.  Yeah.  So it's going to be snowing all day then, right?  And all night.  Yeah, and all night.  Yeah, it's a shame.  Enjoy the song.  Can we go to the song now?  Why?  I was just fascinated by your... 
[01:33:00]  His weather broadcast.  By your broadcasting skills.  All right, yeah.  Why don't we play the song and we'll continue.  Thanks, Eric.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar, and I know that it's meant to be.  She got a walk, ooh, she walking over, and I know it could be my day. 
[01:33:30]  She got a friend, ooh, she's got a friend.  While she's standing in her way.  It's a big, fat friend.  Oh, God, there's always one.  Big, fat friend.  To spoil my food and fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want to knock, leave your chubby friend at home because she's gonna block the car. 
[01:34:00]  Now, I'm afraid of no man with any I'll contend, but I cannot come deep with your big, fat friend.  So, big, fat friend, we meet again.  You won't leave her alone.  You'll roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments, while you're sucking on that chicken bone. 
[01:34:30]  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you, and your Achilles heel, and he's standing next to me, my non-discriminating friend.  So what's that, your account?  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll nail you anyhow.  I know that he's no looker, and he's had a couple rounds. 
[01:35:00]  But with every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds.  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal.  And your big, fat friend.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California, 
[01:35:30]  it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  What are you talking about?  I sit here, I make some asinine comments, and I check the computer.  And you're a good squeezer.  Yeah.  It is insane.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice. 
[01:36:30]  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not exactly a diva.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program live from Los Angeles, California at the Commerce Casino. 
[01:37:00]  It's the World Poker Tour.  That's why we came out here.  Anthony did very, very well yesterday.  Got knocked out about a half hour after the show went off the air.  Yeah.  But went a lot longer than you thought and anyone else thought.  I did better than I thought I would.  And had a really, really good time doing it.  Sure.  More losers entering the room here, Anthony, to watch poker on TV. 
[01:37:30]  This is the bringing together of fire and dynamite.  I don't think anyone thought this out.  No, not at all.  We are broadcasting in a row.  There he is.  Who's that?  It's Chris Ferguson, man.  He's on the final table.  Oh, wow.  You want to talk to him?  Sure.  Come on over here, man.  Hey, Mr. Ferguson.  Come on in.  There he is.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing a radio show. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Come on over.  Have him take a seat.  He's famous.  It's Chris.  How are you doing, man?  Pretty good.  You made it.  You made it.  Final table.  This is your first final table in how long, about?  This is my first final table on the World Poker Tour, actually.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Hard to believe.  And was it rough getting to the final table?  I had to get pretty lucky.  You had to?  Yeah.  Anytime you make a final table, you've got to get lucky. 
[01:38:30]  That's true.  But, you know, in the Invitational, you had some, what they call the fish at the table.  Anybody?  Any of the celebrities that would kind of push overs for you at the table?  Not really.  Actually, I didn't play against all that many celebrities.  You didn't?  Yeah.  The tables I were at had a lot of professional poker players.  And the celebrities I did play against were pretty strong.  Mine, too.  Mine, too, for some reason.  I was hoping to get a table full of, like, some celebrities and stuff.  And I wound up having some pretty heavy hitters over there that made it a little difficult for me,  never having been in any tournaments before.  Yeah, I made it through a few hours, though, which was kind of cool. 
[01:39:00]  I wasn't one of those out-in-25-minutes guys.  So, anybody you're afraid of at the table?  Anybody you're thinking might be?  I bust myself more than anyone ever busts me.  Yeah?  And what about, how many, as far as chips go, where do you stand?  I'm second in chips.  Second in chips?  So, that's not bad.  521,000, I think the average is like 400,000.  Good place to start.  Not too bad.  Yeah.  Now, you've been playing for how many years?  I've been playing for about 10 years professionally.  About 10 years professionally.  Now, before it really took off on television, though, you're just another one of the poker players walking around doing this. 
[01:39:30]  How are you dealing with, because you're probably one of the most recognizable poker players out there at all.  How are you dealing with that?  I absolutely love it.  I think it's just fantastic.  I love when people come up to me.  I mean, they come up to me all the time, and it's just a wonderful feeling.  Do you ever think poker would have the celebrity that it has?  I never would have imagined.  It's just unbelievable.  I remember I won the World Series in 2000, and, you know, every once in a while, a guy would come up to me and say,  Hey, I know who you are.  Well, that was right before it really broke, you know?  Maybe in 2002 is where it really took off. 
[01:40:00]  So, you know, I was on TV a bunch in 2000, but it wasn't really that popular.  And so, every once in a while, I'd walk through an airport.  Every once in a while, a guy would come up to me.  Now, I walk through an airport.  It's like five or six people will come and shake their hand.  You're like the guy, yeah, very, very recognizable.  Yeah, I just love it.  It's just fantastic.  What's the strategy?  I don't know.  Just get out there, do your job.  I've got a job to do, and I'm going to do it.  I'm going to love it.  Great.  Well, good luck to you, and we'll be watching.  We're not going to be able to see any of the whole cards or anything. 
[01:40:30]  I'm pissed off.  I don't know how this is going to work until it ends up on TV.  You know, I'm not going to know if any of these guys are making moves or not.  You're telling me.  Yeah, I know.  Well, he's sitting there, not going to be seeing any whole cards either.  But good luck to you, Chris, and we'll be watching.  All right.  Thanks a lot, Cole.  Where are you from?  I'm from Los Angeles.  I grew up in the Pacific Palisades, actually, so I've got the home court advantage to go  along with everything else.  Good luck to you.  Thanks.  Thanks for adding that, Kenny.  Take it easy, Chris.  Good luck, man.  All right. 
[01:41:00]  There he goes.  Chris Ferguson, man.  Call him Jesus.  They call him Jesus, hoping.  I think I recognize him.  Yeah.  I think.  I don't know, man.  You're not a big poster fan.  Oh, where's Jim Norton?  We've got to go to Jim Norton.  He's on hold.  He's calling us from Houston, Texas.  He had to leave bright and early this morning, Anthony, to get to Houston for his improv gigs.  Yeah.  That's going on all this weekend.  Jimmy.  You guys hear me?  Yes, we can hear you, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  I can hear almost nothing.  I really know how the caller is feeling. 
[01:41:30]  I can hardly hear anything.  Shut up.  We hate you.  Hey, I want to congratulate.  That was a good interview, and I want to congratulate Mike Wallace on that question  as he was walking away.  Where are you from?  That was really good.  Yeah, Kenny's just being...  I try to do my best.  You were fantastic.  Thank you.  What a tool.  Hey, Jim.  Yes?  I heard you met some celebrities last night.  Yeah.  Did you tell the story?  I heard you met Patrick Swayze.  What's that?  I heard you met Patrick Swayze. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, it was really fantastic.  I even said, hey, Patrick, can I get a picture?  I'm a big fan.  I'm not Patrick.  And he walked right by me.  And that was David Keith?  It was David Keith.  I was so annoyed, because I like David Keith a lot.  I mean, I don't like anyone that swallows a ring and then hangs himself in 1998.  And I would love to get a picture with him.  And I was so pissed off at myself.  And stupid Yoshi is tackling it.  And, of course, he didn't know the name.  Jimmy, don't you...  Do you understand, Jimmy, we were just talking about him, like, that day? 
[01:42:30]  Who?  Me and you.  You brought up the guy that hung himself in Officer and a Gentleman that same day.  Oh, I didn't remember.  Yeah, we were talking about him.  And I thought you knew his name.  Well, I do know his name.  Do you know it's not Patrick Swayze, you idiot?  Well, he does look like Swayze a little bit in person.  Yeah.  And I wasn't ready to see him.  And by the way he reacted, you could tell he's probably gotten that a lot,  because his hair's a little bit longer, and he wouldn't even make eye contact. 
[01:43:00]  He's like, I'm not Patrick.  And he just walked by.  And I even doubted him.  I'm like, come on, man.  Yes, you are.  I'm a con.  Oh, you asshole.  What is wrong with you?  I'm a stalker and a retard.  That is really bad.  And then Forrest Whitaker?  Yeah, we were in the jury's.  I was with Yosh and Joey Silvera, and a couple of the guys were just hanging.  Is that the jury?  I was kind of looking over at him.  And so as they got to check, our whole table got out and left, and I had the camera open.  And I guess he saw us looking at him.  Yeah.  And then Joey comes running out like an eight-year-old, and he's like, dude, he's running out the back door. 
[01:43:30]  So that was right after I had the problem with Swayze slash David Keith, and I ran around the corner.  And Forrest saw us coming, and he was creeped out.  When he started walking faster to the parking lot, he seems like a really private guy.  Yeah.  He doesn't seem like the type of guy that likes to be bothered.  He wasn't rude, but you could tell he's very withdrawn and very shy.  He's like a real actor, man.  And so I'm like, can I get a shot with you?  And he's like, I think he thought I was paparazzi.  He's that guy at the end of talk radio, and I was just going to kill him right there in the dark parking lot. 
[01:44:00]  But he took the shot.  He was very nice, and that was that.  Well, two more to add to the collection.  Oh, no, one more.  A one, that's right.  You guys didn't get to do that porno thing last night, huh?  Nah, she kind of flaked out.  I mean, porn chicks.  I mean, I know the reputation they have of complete mental stability is actually not true.  Very dependable.  Yeah.  And they're also very dependable.  Yeah, she just could.  I guess she was busy.  Who knows?  Maybe she's settling for the degree. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know what she's doing.  It really sucks.  I cannot hear you guys.  It's very frustrating.  Wow, yeah.  Well, maybe they'll fix that eventually.  Who knows?  I don't really care anymore.  Jimmy, we're having a good time.  I mean, it's not as exciting as yesterday, because they got us in this really weird room  where a bunch of people are being escorted in, and they're going to watch poker on TV  while the actual event is taking place next door.  It's the strangest thing.  So they're all sitting in chairs looking in our general direction.  And they're all a bunch of zeros.  Of course they are.  They're an absolute bunch of zeros, and they're just staring at us. 
[01:45:00]  You don't know these people, Ovi.  And they don't even know we're talking about them.  Yes, they do.  Oh, they do?  Well, that guy does now.  Oh, this is a nightmare.  It really is awful.  Chris Ferguson working the room.  Can they hear the broadcast?  Yeah, they can.  I don't care.  No, it's not like on speakers or anything, but the room isn't loud enough where they can  still just hear us talking.  Yeah.  Can they hear me?  Oh, they can't hear me, no. 
[01:45:30]  No, they can't hear you.  Oh, no.  You would...  Unfortunately, leave a hat to dry, I'm sure.  A lot of people liked yesterday's show, Jimmy, because we were just throwing each other  under the bus over and over and over again.  I told most of the stories on the air.  The whole Ed Asner thing, I thought it was going to be some great radio, because, you know,  you're like a Republican, leaning conservative at times, and he's like, he's as left as they  come, and you just all of a sudden just go, yeah, I agree with everything you have  to say, Ed.  I agree.  This idiot said that there was a conservative media. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, ABC, CBS, Dan Rather, they're all conservatives, and they speak to them  wholeheartedly.  Even a babbling old ass, and he was wrong.  And I was telling Anthony that the sweat was pouring off my forehead, because I had my  poker face on for Ed Asner, but I thought he was seeing right through me.  Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.  He was getting the best of me there for a while.  I guess, I don't know if he was spoken about the uncomfortable things that were written  about us, and I thought we were having fun with that guy.  I didn't realize there was a problem.  Oh, yeah, he wasn't happy.  Yeah, we read his blog, Daniel. 
[01:46:30]  Negrano, yeah.  Yeah.  We read the whole blog, and, you know, whatever.  I mean, I just, it's just too bad that he didn't confront us on our program, you know?  Yeah, because it was like, I actually liked the guy.  I thought it was a cool interview.  I mean, I know Rogan was, like, asking him, did you ever picture, like, now your ex-girlfriend  being gorilla fucked?  And, you know, that's got to be unpleasant to hear, but we all laughed about it.  You know, we were having a good time with the guy, and he just got a little bit pissed off.  Yeah.  So, whatever.  A little.  All right, Jimmy.  All right, guys.  I'm sorry, I can't hear you. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  This is actually one of my better phone-ins.  I loathe using the phone.  Yes, we know.  We know.  How is, how do you find Houston?  It's fantastic.  And I'm staying in a very nice hotel.  I'm very happy.  Oh, the flight was a nightmare, though.  Why?  Duke.  It's not like I'm bitching.  I get my vegetable soup for my meal, so it doesn't have carrot in it.  He's back in first class, ladies and gentlemen.  You didn't check to see whose birthday it was in the back and go pull him out and give 
[01:47:30]  him a little prize?  Not enough carrot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Take somebody else out and put them up.  Yeah.  I'll never do that again.  Fuck, I don't care.  If Steve gets brain cancer and has two hours to live, he's going to die in coach.  Hey, Norton.  Yeah.  I got a whisper.  Hopefully you can hear this.  You want to hear, can it get everyone very uncomfortable in the room?  Oh, no, no.  All right, come on.  Grab the wireless mic and talk to Red Zero with her head turned up.  We can't get them thrown out of here again.  Zeroes. 
[01:48:00]  Ready to watch poker on TV.  Who do you want him to talk to?  Which one do you want?  The woman there?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Anyone.  Whoever you want, Kenny.  I'm turning around.  I'm not even going to look at this.  I can't watch.  How are you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny from the radio.  Were you a nice couple talk on the radio?  Sure.  Actually, that's my brother, but that's all right.  Really?  You could still be a couple.  Okay.  I'm visiting from Canada.  Just flew in last night.  He's living here.  Oh, no.  Just flew in last night.  Yeah?  And I bet your arms are tired. 
[01:48:30]  It was a long flight, yeah.  What part of Canada?  Niagara Falls.  Niagara Falls with the water.  What are you doing here?  Just visiting vacation.  Oh, you got some travel agent.  Yeah.  Does your brother got to say anything?  I might be able to say something.  Sure.  What does he like to know?  I don't know.  Talk.  Talk.  Well, we just came over here today to see a live film of the World Poker Tour.  I went once in Vegas, and it was kind of exciting.  So, we see some poker stars downstairs here today. 
[01:49:00]  And Mr. Ferguson over here was kind of nice.  Got a picture with him, too.  All right.  You're kind of boring.  I'm moving on to somebody else.  What about you, Toch?  You got anything to say?  I'm really looking forward to seeing the tournament tonight.  And you look pretty good yourself.  Why?  Thanks.  You like me?  Yeah.  I like you a lot.  You got a room here?  No, but I could get one.  Nice.  You got to respect that.  Wow.  I bet you look good in lingerie.  I have some on right now. 
[01:49:30]  What color?  Pink.  Pink?  Little pink panties?  No panties.  No panties.  Oh, you're a filthy animal.  I like you.  Oh, I like you, too.  Really?  Where are you from?  I'm from Whittier, California.  Where's that?  It's about 10 miles northeast of here.  Really?  And you're here alone?  Well, my husband's coming, but I could always tell him to turn around and leave.  Yeah, give him a call, all right?  And I'll see you later. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Very good.  Wow.  All right.  He copped out on us, Jimmy.  What's that?  Did he hear all that?  Yeah, who copped out on you?  I can't.  He did good, though, out there.  All right.  We'll let you be.  Do you think I don't know what that means?  What do you mean?  No.  You did fine.  We'll let you be.  Here's what that means to the radio world.  This is really starting to stink.  Believe me, I don't ever recall you letting a great call be. 
[01:50:30]  You don't ever say, well, let you be.  When someone is dying and dragging the show down the drain, you go, all right, we'll let  you be.  We'll move on to something more exciting, like a break.  Let you be.  All right.  All right.  But, you know, don't give all our secrets away.  Oh, that's awful.  We'll let you be.  We'll let you be.  That's what you say to Frenchie when he's bombing on the air.  Well, you know.  All right.  I'll see you guys on Monday.  Have a good time out there. 
[01:51:00]  All right, Jimmy.  You'll have fun there in Houston.  Have fun at the improv.  All right, guys.  There he goes.  Jim Norton, everyone.  Live from Houston, Texas.  It's our little Jimmy.  Old Jimmy Norton.  All right.  All alone.  It's all alone out there.  You want to get into the news now or you want to take a quick break?  Want to go quick break?  All right, we'll do a very, very quick break, and when we get back, we'll have Club Soda  Kenny doing the news for us.  Doing the news.  And then we got Mark Tyke here with a couple of his friends that are going to play a couple  goofy songs for us.  They're going to horrify the room.  Look what's walking in now.  There's some old broad, some old Asian woman, and they're going to have to listen. 
[01:51:30]  I hope these songs aren't too sexually explicit.  I hope they are the worst songs they'll ever hear.  And these people probably think it's entertainment provided by the casino or something for their  listening pleasure while they sit and wait for the TVs to come on.  And it's just going to be horrific.  Well, no, we'll do.  We'll have Kenny make an announcement to the room that while you're getting ready to watch  poker on TV, we got some...  Oh, the casino has supplied entertainment.  Yeah, we got some entertainment for you.  That way they can't complain.  Yeah, and we'll see what happens, okay?  Oh, that's good.  That's the bit, and we'll do it next. 
[01:52:00]  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting for the World Poker Tour at the Commerce Casino in  Los Angeles, California.  Live from the World Poker Tour in Los Angeles, California, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  What did you say?  When you tell this effing show, there are four words that you must know.  Learn to punch out.  I'm punchin' out.  I'm punchin' out.  Punchin' out.  Punchin' out.  You guys are great.  Hey, you ever do that night, where are you?  Where are you going all the hell? 
[01:52:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ew.  That's disgusting, dude.  He's gonna wipe his fingers off.  Opie's peeling an orange.  Opie's peeling an orange.  Orange.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:53:00]  What kind of orange is that?  It's like, I think they call it like, um, uh, a blood, I don't know, blood, blood orange  because it's like red instead of orange on the inside.  I wouldn't eat that.  I never saw nothing like that.  Dude, that is really rank-looking.  Yeah, I wouldn't eat that.  You made a little hole, and it looks like you should jam a tampon in it.  Yeah, that's not a right thing.  Why?  It's California fruit, boys and girls.  No, no, half is red and half is orange.  Yeah.  Don't eat that.  Oh, my God.  This is something really good.  This is like blood clots.  Yeah, it's got a clot in it. 
[01:53:30]  There's blood clots in my orange.  Look at this.  Where's that nice banana I bought you?  It's over here.  I'll eat the banana.  In my pants.  Yeah.  Let me see you eat the banana.  All right, the room is starting to fill up with a bunch of fine folks, and we're going  to have some entertainment for them in a few minutes here.  All right.  But first, Anthony, I think we should get into the news with Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we've been looking for a newscaster.  For some reason, Washington has decided the Opie and Anthony show needs a newscast on a 
[01:54:00]  daily basis, and they think we should get a newscaster.  So we've been trying people out.  Kenny did a great job a couple weeks ago, I guess.  And we figure we give him another shot here on the road, see how he works under pressure.  He had to gather his newscast together pretty quickly.  XM also needs a show about cars going around in circles.  I won't touch that with a 10-foot pole.  Hey, is this for us?  Yes.  Yeah.  Look at what we get.  Chips and...  Potato chips and coffee. 
[01:54:30]  What a combo.  Who the hell got the potato chips and the coffee?  Mr. Poe.  Ooh.  All right, why don't we start to teletype and get into some news with Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you, people.  But I just have to say before I get started that you guys do a terrific job of current  events.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  I just wanted that to be known for the record.  Thank you, Kenny.  And this is like the headline news, so it's like the Reader's Digest version of things. 
[01:55:00]  Is that what you're doing?  Yeah, because I only had like the New York Post to go through, and it's funny I got the  New York Post because we're in Los Angeles, get it?  All right.  My top story for today is Michael Jackson.  There's something going on with him.  Yeah, they picked the jury, and there's like a lot of mothers on the jury, so you know he's  going to fry. 
[01:55:30]  Well, Kenny, there's eight women, and six of them are moms.  Yeah, so he's got to fry because, you know, mothers got little kids, and they don't like  kid touchers.  Well, now I've heard, on the other hand, some people think that the mothers being on  the jury.  The defense might be able to try to make a story that the children are fibbing, and  parents will understand that their children do sometimes lie, and maybe that can be an  advantage for wacko jacko.  Well, you know, Anthony, you make a good point.  Thank you, Kenny.  I was just repeating some point I heard. 
[01:56:00]  That is a compelling argument there you had.  Opie, comment?  No, not at all.  No, he's eating a period orange.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  For my next story, you know the actress Natalie Portman?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, she was in Star Wars.  Yeah, she's doing something now.  Some new movie where she's kissing Jews by the Western Wall.  What?  I don't know.  That was a headline.  For some movie she's making, she's kissing Jews by the Western Wall. 
[01:56:30]  Uh-huh.  Is that the big whaling wall?  And?  Yeah.  It's a very religious site, and she's kissing some Jewish guy, and I think the  locals are up in arms over there, right?  I didn't get that from Kenny.  Where are you getting this news?  I guess they don't like the whole locking lips thing, because the headline is,  Unkosher Kisses.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, so that's the headline in the New York paper today, that she's kissing?  But you don't have any details on that story, Kenny?  Forbidden kiss fury, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Memo to Natalie Portman, it's called the Western Wall, not the kissing wall. 
[01:57:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:57:30]  They were chanting whores?  Yeah, whores, whores, whores.  Nice.  So, all right.  That's it, though?  No more details, Kenny?  I don't know.  Kenny's newscast.  I could tell you a story about when I visited Israel, but I don't want to say anything off color.  Yeah, don't.  All right.  Your last appearance was...  I know.  I know.  You went too far in a joke, and we weren't happy with that.  Yeah.  All right.  We weren't.  Go ahead, Kenny.  So, another headline is, the women are most likely to get the super raids. 
[01:58:00]  Did you know that?  Well, yeah, I did, Kenny.  Because, you know, they're the ones that have the unprotected sex.  Women, number one AIDS threat.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  I like how Opie bails me out on everything.  I'm noticing that.  You're helping him a little too much.  It's kind of my job on this show.  Hmm.  All right.  Go ahead, Kenny.  What do you have on that?  That's it.  The headline.  This is the headline news.  Oh, wait.  You don't have any little comments or any details on the stories?  No, because I don't have my reading glasses. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, my God.  So, all I could do is read the headlines, and I didn't have the producers to help me out  with news stories like they did last time.  To make you look good?  Yeah.  So, I'm just faking it.  All right.  You're not doing a very good job.  How about the next one?  The next one, the Robert Blake trial.  You know, that little rascal's kid.  Okay, sure.  And Beretta, of course.  Yeah.  The defense rests, and he did not testify.  Go figure.  The defense rested?  Yeah.  They rested, and he didn't testify. 
[01:59:00]  So, he's got to be going away for life.  That's the way I see it.  This is the worst newscast I've ever heard.  Thank you.  And now we'll go on to some entertainment news.  All right.  There's a Paris Hilton is just apologizing to everybody about that stuff in her cell phone.  What do you mean she's apologizing?  Ah, she's like, sorry.  Because her...  Yeah, because like, all her, like, stuff was in the cell phone, and somebody did that. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  You know?  And that's, uh, and now she's apologizing, and that's it?  Yeah, yeah.  She's sorry about that, because it's always her.  Like, everything happens to her, because she's Paris Hilton or something like that.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  You know?  And moving on.  Um, do you know they got iPods now that take pictures?  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  They got a new iPod that takes pictures.  And then, like, in the gossip thing, I saw there's a picture of J-Lo and Beyonce double-teaming 
[02:00:00]  this soccer player, David Beckham.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  There's a picture about that.  What?  This isn't news.  You're not doing the news.  And there was nothing going on.  You're supposed to be informative.  You're supposed to inform people what these headlines mean.  It was J-Lo and Beyonce.  Uh, they're just getting a picture taken with that soccer guy, David.  Yeah, but...  There's no story there.  Well, you gotta figure, what are they doing after the picture? 
[02:00:30]  I'm not stupid.  I can read between the lines there.  It's at the premiere of their new Pepsi commercial.  You don't think he's getting in there?  No.  Come on.  Look at them.  Beyonce and J-Lo?  Nothing going on.  It's just a photo op.  He's a handsome guy.  Believe me, something's going on there.  All right.  Something's going on there, Anthony.  Something's going on there.  You heard it here first.  And now for sports.  You got sports music?  No, we don't have sports music.  Well, maybe they do. 
[02:01:00]  Eric's good like that.  Nope.  No, Eric's not good like that.  There's a big story in basketball about Chris Webber.  Yeah, Chris Webber.  Go ahead.  He went from Sacramento to Philly.  The 76ers.  Kenny's sweating.  I am sweating.  Look at his forehead.  Dude, he is sweating.  I'm done.  You have flop sweat all over your forehead.  Oh, my God.  Someone get a picture of that.  That's my newscast. 
[02:01:30]  What about Randy Moss?  Who is he?  A football player.  He's going to the Raiders.  I need a dish towel.  I think the Raiders gave up a first-round draft pick, right?  And then Drew Bledsoe is going to the Cowboys.  Playing for Parcells again.  I'm under the gun here.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  Get ready for your big introduction.  All right.  I got to go towel off.  Oh, my man.  He might pass out.  That really made him nervous.  That really worked him up. 
[02:02:00]  That is flop sweat coming down.  See?  He did such a good job the first time.  We should have left it at that.  Well, he needs everyone around him to make him look good.  Right.  And the producers and the special music and the writers and all that.  I can't believe he just wrote down headlines and started reading them.  All right.  Very good, Kenny.  Let's get Mark Tyke on the program here.  The room is filling up with more people that you would never want to hang out with.  I'm going to take my headphones off a minute and see how loud it is in here.  All right.  Hey. 
[02:02:30]  No, no.  They can't hear us.  They can't hear us, and now I can't hear you.  There we go.  All right.  Beautiful.  What a bunch of losers.  Oh, you wanted to make sure they couldn't hear you?  I'm a pussy like that, Opie, you know.  Oh, all right.  I might have to sit down at a poker table with some of these people in the future now that  I'm a big poker player.  Mark Tyke stopping by to say hi.  How do I follow that?  How do I follow?  It's very hard, but try.  Actually, that's the easiest thing to follow in radio right there. 
[02:03:00]  I can pretty much say anything right now.  Yeah.  How can you bomb after that?  By sweating more, perhaps you could do better than him, but I feel that's impossible.  So Mark Tyke, you know, he pals around with Lynch, and they're quite successful now,  Anthony, doing a bunch of the songs together.  Thanks to you guys.  Thanks to you guys.  I mean, the tri-state area has blown up.  We're mere stepping stones for the talent to just use to get across that river.  If by that you mean Lynch, then yes, because I'm fucking coattails. 
[02:03:30]  I'm plus one.  I see you on commercials, though.  No, well, yeah.  I love the Fly commercial.  What's the Fly commercial?  I don't think I've ever seen it.  How have you not seen this?  Please explain it to Opie.  It's a commercial for a rum company.  Bacardi.  Bacardi.  And when I did the audition, it was like I fucking won American Idol.  Really?  There were so many people auditioning for this.  Really?  And then they had no idea.  When I finally got it, I had no idea what I was in for.  The costume was a good hundred pounds. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  And it was made out of foam latex.  The Fly costume that he's in.  But I did get to go to Buenos Aires and shoot the commercial down there.  Buenos Aires.  For no apparent reason.  Why would they shoot at that?  I think the help's cheaper down there.  That's about it.  You've seen this?  It's like a day in the life of the Fly because he lives such a short period of time that he  really lives it up.  He takes life by the balls and with Bacardi lives it up.  So he's flying around.  What are some of the scenarios the Fly is in?  I get a tattoo. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, he gets a tat.  I get two girls and I take them back to my place.  Yeah.  He's right up on the ceiling.  Right.  And I went to the ceiling looking down over his fly shoulder at the chicks on the bed  and just kind of smiling.  I ride a mechanical bull.  Yeah, mechanical bull.  Which meant that I had absolutely no leverage whatsoever.  As soon as they start the mechanical bull, I go right off.  All that mass from the costume would just be thrown in one direction.  Just ass over tea kettle each time.  They're like, can you hold on this time?  I'm like, I don't know, with the three fingers that you gave me in the foam latex suit, I'll 
[02:05:00]  try to hold on as much as I can.  It's redimediculous.  Yeah, we were watching the TV and it's like, oh my God, we know that fly.  Was it a Super Bowl commercial?  No, no, no.  But it's been played a lot.  Yeah, and it was really degrading.  It was incredibly degrading.  And if not bad enough that they had to put me in a costume, they're like, yeah, you don't  have enough hair on your head, so we're going to staple some hair into the costume.  So I have bangs.  Yeah, fly bangs. 
[02:05:30]  Because flies have bangs, right?  Flies have bangs, sure.  Flies are very hairy little animals.  And at the end, don't you die at the end of it?  I do die at the end, but they're like, now we want to bring you back.  And I mean, so I'm every fly now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the every fly.  Well, how many flies?  They all look alike.  So it's going to be a series of commercials?  Well, gosh, I hope so.  If I can get back into that costume and get paid.  Staple those bangs back to your head?  Yeah, get paid tens upon twenties of dollars.  How much do you get for a spot like that?  It goes on a residual thing. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah?  How many times they play it?  Yeah, basically.  So I did all right.  I bought a car with it.  Ooh.  It's a 72 Impala, but I got rid of that car.  You got rid of that car, finally?  Yeah.  Thank God.  I went strode with these guys from Los Angeles to Vegas.  Really?  In a bad car?  Dude, there was a slight.  Wasn't there a slice in the tire or something?  It's a big tire.  You got three more?  Yeah, babies get caught in that tire.  There was something going on with the tire that he had to tell us all as we're taking,  how many hours is it to Vegas from Los Angeles? 
[02:06:30]  Five.  Five hours.  Just before we start, and it's a rainy day, which is very rare out here.  Yeah.  He's telling us how bald his tire is and that it could blow at any moment, and he should  have got it looked at before we went on this little road trip.  So now you're sitting in the back seat.  That's all you're thinking the whole time.  You got the beautiful view.  You're driving through the desert, and all you're thinking is, is this tire going to hold  up?  Right.  I can't go to the tire store before I go to Vegas?  I'm so excited.  Of course.  I can't wait.  My knee gets all jittery.  I got to get to Vegas.  Are you going to spend money on a tire that you could spend at a table? 
[02:07:00]  Exactly.  Somewhere in Vegas?  And then we were at some really cool bar at the top of one of the hotels.  We were at the foundation room at House of Blues.  Yeah, the foundation room at House of Blues.  Right.  And you had a bunch of guys from L.A. that went out on the trip.  Charlie's one of them.  He's the one that rode in the car with us.  Well, I thought he looked familiar.  He's a big, dumb animal.  But he wasn't the guy.  There was some other guys that thought they were doing real well with these two really  hot chicks.  Remember that?  And these girls were like, well, we're in real estate.  Hint, hint.  Nudge, nudge.  And these guys were convinced that they were just, you know, that the hottest chicks in 
[02:07:30]  the place wanted them.  Right.  And you can understand that being from Vegas, you believe everything that everybody says.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  And then going back to Los Angeles and believing the exact same thing over and over again.  Right.  But these guys turned me on to the real Vegas when I was out there.  Off the Strip, about four or five blocks.  Right, right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, there are two Vegases.  The family Vegas and then the real Vegas.  Where you can rent, like, a motel for $10 for the week.  Pretty much.  Literally.  Really.  Pawn shops where they... 
[02:08:00]  Shut up!  Do they hear that?  You know, shut up?  They're taking care of business.  Do they hear that?  What?  It's a very professional game.  Is this the kind of staging area?  I've never seen more zeros in my life.  Yeah.  I believe they...  They interrupted a good story.  That's how much of a loser these people are.  They're actually taking a tour of the World Poker Tour.  Yeah.  Touring the different rooms that people are going to watch TV in. 
[02:08:30]  But anyway, then the pawn shops where they advertise, you could put up the, you know,  your house, basically, for a loan.  Really?  It's the greatest.  It's the greatest.  Yeah, it's plenty of places to just destroy your life right there.  There's a bar off the Strip that everything's a dollar in the bar.  Really?  And you can buy a glass.  You can buy a picture on the wall.  Everything's a dollar.  Everything's for sale.  Everything's a dollar.  Except they're, right in the middle, there's one of those children's riding toys that's  out in front of Kmart and everything like that, that every woman feels like she has 
[02:09:00]  to get on.  Oh, really?  It's the most disgusting thing you've ever seen in Charlie.  Do they get some kind of thrill out of this?  Is there a sexual...  You think.  You think.  But it's...  I think it's because there's nothing else except everything's a dollar.  And they're like...  What a shithole that sounds like.  Exactly.  It sounds like a real shithole.  And I'm working there on Fridays and Saturdays.  Yeah.  If anybody wants to come by.  Yeah, but that was an eye-opener to see the real Vegas.  Yeah.  If you ever go to Vegas, definitely go off the strip a little bit, preferably in an armored  vehicle, and check out the real Vegas. 
[02:09:30]  It is so depressing.  People walking around just delusional and, you know, hocked up on something.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  I'm looking at World Poker Tour people.  Crew members making hand signs.  David Spade and Bam Bam Bigelow.  Oh, I think they got pissed because I screamed shut up.  No.  No, they're trying to get the TV hooked up.  Oh, so these farmers could watch the poker on TV?  I think they're great.  So, Mark, who did you bring with us today?  I brought my friends The King and the Barber.  They're going to do a couple songs.  The King and the Barber. 
[02:10:00]  King and the Barber.  King and the Barber.  My friend Charlie King and my friend Lance Barber.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I thought maybe those were...  That's interesting that it's actually their last names because I was waiting for some  long, involved story of why we were calling The King.  Hey, can we...  One day, we were in London.  Nothing like that, huh?  Nothing.  Just his last name.  Nothing, nothing.  Can we set this up like they're playing for the audience?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I mean, quickly.  I mean, you could just jerry-rig it.  You could hold the mics and stuff.  They wouldn't hear it, though.  Like, they're just going to hear them singing.  They're not going to hear them mic'd or anything. 
[02:10:30]  I don't know.  Our audience will hear it mic'd.  Yeah?  But they won't.  All right.  Well, I'd love for this audience to hear these songs.  Really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See, that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Oh, delightful.  Well, Kenny, come here.  Come here.  Put your headset up.  Yes, sir?  Get all these farmers to come real close and tell them that we have some special entertainment  for them.  That it's...  Hey, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.  You know what you do?  Don't say it's a part of the...  No.  Just say special entertainment.  Special entertainment, yeah.  Okay.  While you wait.  While you wait. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Here's the microphone so we can hear it on the radio, too.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Attention, people.  We're going to have a special treat for everyone.  Hold the mic to your mouth.  People?  Yeah, his mic's not working.  Hello, people?  We need his mic on, bro.  Hold on.  Hold on, Kenny.  Jesus Christ.  Stupid mic doesn't work.  They're not going to hear anyway, but...  All right. 
[02:11:30]  Is it working?  No, it's not working.  No.  It's still not working.  It's still not working.  It's still not working.  It's still not working.  It's still not working.  Give him the wired mic.  Pull a wired mic off of there.  Yeah, just take one of those.  Come on in, people.  We have a special treat for everyone.  We have some musical guests.  They're famous.  Why are you walking away?  Come on in.  Don't be shy.  While you wait.  While you wait.  Come on right up.  I want you to hear the beautiful songs.  Come on. 
[02:12:00]  Four eyes.  Let's go.  Come on up.  I want to hear my numbers.  All right, really?  This is a special treat for everybody.  No charge, because I know you guys don't have money.  Your number's zero.  No charge.  Here we go.  I guess there's going to be some kind of lottery where they pick numbers for people  to get lucky enough to get a seat at the actual final table here at the World Poker Tour.  No, they're going to get a seat at looking to watch.  Right.  To watch.  Well, yeah, exactly. 
[02:12:30]  All right, so who do we got, Mark?  This is the King and the Barber.  All right, the King and the Barber are going to sing a couple songs for us today.  Hi, guys.  What kind of songs do they play?  Why don't you get up in that?  They do some country songs, little country ditties.  They're very folky.  They do folk music?  You like the folk?  All right, yeah, we like the folk, but one of your guys is strangled by his harmonica  and the headset.  We'll save the harmonica.  You're going to save the harmonica?  Do you need to be heard?  That's good.  You can hear that.  That's fine. 
[02:13:00]  Guitars come booming through.  Yeah, the booming through.  Is it too much?  No, it's good.  Good.  Are you background vocals on this song?  We both sing.  All right.  Well, you're going to want to get closer to that mic then, probably.  Because he's got a headset, so he's going to be booming.  All right, hold on.  We'll throw this headset on you.  Hot stuff.  Now everyone can be heard.  There you go.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's so new country now.  Thanks, you guys.  We don't need a mic?  Now, we'll get Mark a mic in a minute here.  Is that working now, Dan?  This is working.  No, it's not working.  Let me...  No, I'm going to keep it. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, here it goes.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  All right.  So why don't you introduce these guys, Mark?  These guys come straight out of Battle Creek, Michigan.  So they're really country folk.  The hood.  Yeah, this is the king and the barber.  BC in the house.  Yeah, we're going to start you off with a little love song here.  All right.  I think it's something you guys will appreciate.  Yeah?  And thanks for having us here at the audition.  No problem.  Very nice.  This is a love song.  It's what most love songs are about. 
[02:14:00]  About pain.  In love.  I want to dedicate this to the song, the first woman that ever made love to me.  All right.  That's nice.  Sweet.  And me.  The audience looks like they're coming forward now to enjoy this song, Anthony.  Very eager.  Very eager.  Lay your leather down tonight.  Put your handcuffs in the drawer. 
[02:14:30]  Throw away your strap-on dildo.  Get up off the floor.  Cause I want to love you like a lady.  And I don't want to hurt no more. 
[02:15:00]  So lay your leather down tonight.  Lay your leather down.  Just pretend, pretend, pretend that you're not a whore.  Take the rubber ball gag out of my mouth.  And the clothes pins off my skin.  Clean up all the candle wax. 
[02:15:30]  That's collected on my chin.  Cause I want to love you like a lady.  And I don't want to hurt no more.  Take those spurs that you've been jangling. 
[02:16:00]  Away from all the things that I've got dangling. 
[02:16:30]  Cause my nipples were never meant.  To bear the weight of a cinder block.  I'll put a ring around your finger.  And you take this one off.  My  Cog.  Yeah, yeah.  And I want to love you  Like a lady. 
[02:17:00]  And I don't want to hurt no more.  So lay your leather down tonight.  You're leather down.  So lay your leather down tonight.  You're leather down.  So lay your leather down tonight.  Just pretend  Pretend 
[02:17:30]  It's your night  It's your night  It's your night  It's your night  It's your night  Bravo.  Bravo.  The three people left in the room have applauded that song.  Wow.  It's the king and the barber.  We know how to clear them out, don't we?  I have never seen that happen.  There is nobody left in the room.  The Ward Polkwood people came and ushered everybody out. 
[02:18:00]  I cannot believe  You know who's left?  People that know us.  Yeah.  People that know us.  You know, they were getting into the song  And all of a sudden  Everyone got up and left.  It was a big gaggle  And they just walked out the door  And now  The one lady that thought Kenny was hot earlier  She went  She gasped  She went  And then all of a sudden  Everyone just started filing out of the room.  You know, it was great  The smiles on their faces  When you guys first started 
[02:18:30]  They were like sitting smiling  And their heads were going back and forth a little bit  And they were bouncing  Ooh  Yeah  And then I think they heard some of the lyrics  Very nice  Very touching song  Sweet and sensitive  Yeah, very pretty  Very pretty  Thank you guys  They're saying that the mics are a bit too close to their mouths  Because you guys got one more to do, right?  Oh, we got some voices  We got pipes on us  Yeah?  Yeah  I think it's when you  All right  Good luck with that  He's got a harmonica  I don't think that's going to work  Monica, headset mic  Yeah  Well, Ben and Steve 
[02:19:00]  I mean, we could use these mics  You don't have to really mic the guitars  They're booming  Maybe we hold the mics for them  Yeah, true  What do you think?  Will that work better, Ant?  Or you could just pull those headset mics  I bet you  I bet you don't hear them  Yeah  Pull them away  And slowly  Does that sound better?

Like what?  I don't know  A little biography about yourself  Like, you know  I hear  I guess you're into music  Because I hear him mention Grammys  Lemmy from Motorhead 
[02:35:00]  Motorhead, bro  Kenny  And he did Triple H's walk-on music for the WWE  That's true  Really?  Yeah  I'm just fascinated by your tight pants  Did you get those like on Melrose or something?  No, I haven't made  You do?  Oh, nice  He was commenting on how big your package was  When you were walking up  Yeah, when you walked up  Kenny was like  Wow, look at Lemmy's junk  Yeah  Figured somebody would look  It was Kenny  Yeah  But no, you got a nice look there with the boots  Thank you  Basic black  That's good  Black's good  You don't have to wash it  So 
[02:35:30]  Yeah  And you're right, you're right  So is there anything else  Like, you know  Because seriously  All kidding aside  I've been in a coma for a few years  So  He did  He just came out of it  Yeah  And they had me on the show as a pity  So  I was just wondering  Yeah  Just tell me a little bit about yourself  I'm trying to catch up  I'm 59 years old  We just got a Grammy  We've had a few hits  We've had 21 albums out  That's about it  Got an American tour coming up  He's had a hell of a career  59  And he continues  Yeah  30 year career 
[02:36:00]  Still drinking  Like you're a teenager  Right, Lemmy?  Well, I'm a teenager in here  In the brain  You're a teenager still?  That keeps you young, right?  But Jack?  I don't know  I think it sort of  You know  Preserves you  It pickles you a little  Yeah  In more ways than 32  Yeah  Got it  Now, I heard from our own Steve C  That you're writing a lot these days  Who are you writing for?  Well, I'm doing a solo album  Mostly right now  Yeah  And then I've written a few songs  For Ozzy, you know  In the past  Who do you have backing you up?  Ozzy Osbourne? 
[02:36:30]  Oh  Now, you remember him  Before you went into your  Yeah, from Black Sabbath  Yeah  That's what I remember  Back in the day  Right  Yeah  So you're writing with Ozzy  I was, yeah  Wrote a little with Ozzy  And now solo  Who do you got backing you up?  Dave Grohl  There you go  Two tracks with  The Reverend Horton Heat  Oh, wow  Two tracks with The Dand  Two tracks with the band  From Berlin  Called Skiw Siskin  Good friend of mine  Yeah  How was it writing with Ozzy? 
[02:37:00]  Well, it was dead easy really  He just  He would do the basic track  And go  Eh, eh, eh  But he wanted the vocals to be  And send it to me  And I'd sit back  And write the vocals  And send them back to him  Dead simple, you know  So you weren't in the same room writing?  No  Because that would be  You know, you want to talk about reality TV  That would have been interesting to watch  Yeah  It would be even more interesting to try and do  I suppose  Yeah  Ozzy's cool, you know  Ozzy's smart enough, you know  He ain't no dummy  You know, they just make him root that way on TV 
[02:37:30]  You know  I agree with you on that  It's all in the editing of those shows  Right then  You know, you can cut anything into anything  And make it seem like anything else  You know, it's just not  He does come across pretty stupid  And he's accepting the paycheck, so  It's not  It's his persona on TV now, isn't it?  Yeah  It's a shame, baby  You watch any TV, Lemmy?  What do you like?  You don't watch any?  I don't watch the other ones  No?  Is your life just all about rocking?  All about music and drinking?  I can't imagine  No, women too  Women too 
[02:38:00]  Well, that's all part of the whole rock attitude, you know  That's true  But he didn't actually mention it  So I thought  He wants people to know  That he's banging women, Anthony  I just can't  You can never picture Lemmy bored at home  Going, maybe I'll play some video games  Or something, you know  It's all about just the rocking and the babes  And the drinking  No, it's fun, you know  Yeah  Well, what do you do?  I wouldn't doubt it  It sounds like a lot of fun  What do you do in your downtime?  When you're not doing the music?  I chase women mostly  On the road, you have less time to chase them 
[02:38:30]  So when you're off the road  You get to catch them sometimes  Yeah  Our own Steve says  He knows a lot about you  That you're into black chicks  More than white girls  Yeah  Really?  What's the difference  That makes it more appealing to you?  They're darker  The darker the meat  The sweeter the treat  Is that it?  Yeah  You're not exclusive though  You'll go, you know  There's a hot  What do we got there?  God knows  What are you giving 
[02:39:00]  Fat black women  Steve, what are you giving Lemmy?  Yoshi just handed me  Well, wait  Sorry  Thank you, Dan  Yeah  Yoshi just handed me  Two boxes  Of  Sorry  No, he doesn't like fat chicks  Of black girl porn  Yeah  Big black  Black girls get nasty too  And fatty girls four  And it's all black girl porn  Take your fat black girl porn away  They're fat  It's huge fat girls  You know  He wants  You want slim  I like them wiry 
[02:39:30]  So that you fight back  There you go  But that's your fetish  You like the black girls  It's not a fetish  It's not a fetish  It's just a  Preference  A preference  I should say  Sure  But like I said  You'll go with the white girls too  Though, right?  Yeah  Japanese  Take anything  I don't care  That's it  I just like it  As long as they're female  And they're still coming backstage  At the shows  And you know  The groupies  Have you ever been with a Filipino?  I don't like the word groupies  No?  Yeah  Really?  Yeah  Because I was with a Filipino girl last night 
[02:40:00]  Yeah  But by the end of the night  She wasn't Filipino  She was Filipinas  Oh, that's good  Jesus, is that awful  Your sense of humor is still in a coma, Kenny  Yeah  Oh, jeez  Look, you sent Lemmy back to doodling  I know  We were doing fine  We were having a little conversation here  Yeah, I'm doing sharp edges  He was coming out of his shell a little bit  And look  Now he's back to doodling  Yeah, everything was nice and rounded before  And now they're all sharp-edged and jagged 
[02:40:30]  What have you done?  Psychologists could tell us what that's all about  She ruined it  Or a psychiatrist  War  I actually have a Lemmy moment  I have a Lemmy moment  From back in  How did it be?  Nineteen  Maybe  Ninety  One  Ninety-two  Oh, the dark ages  New York City  I was opening for you  I was  Opening act  In one of these clubs in New York City  And I was singing in a band back then  And my guitar player and you were drinking Maker's Mark backstage for a while before the show 
[02:41:00]  When we got on stage, he couldn't play fucking guitar  You had gotten him so drunk  You're kidding  He was just a catastrophe  Stumbling  Well, I mean, nobody forced it down his throat  No, no, of course not  He was so thrilled to be drinking with you  That he forgot maybe he can't keep pace with you  Because you can really put it away  That he was incapable of playing guitar  You can never forget what you're doing, you know  Yeah, you know, it's like playing with the pros  You know, you can't sit there and do shot for shot with Lemmy 
[02:41:30]  Well, you can if you learn how to do it, right?  You've got to start young, I gather  Put the years in, you know  Yeah  Well, he thought he was, you know, a big man  He's doing it  Well, he was still a big man  It's just that he's lying down a lot, you know  He was lying down after that  Yeah, it was a very memorable moment, though  There have been a few people like that, yeah  Yeah, can't quite keep up  It's funny, there's an English band called Girl School, all girl band, right?  And they are fierce drinkers, man  I mean, they're up there with us, you know 
[02:42:00]  And it's funny to see the guys they pull at shows  Try and drink them under the table  Because the guy's always this macho man and stuff, you know  Oh, would you like a drink, baby?  And Kim go, yeah, you know  And then they probably think they're going to get lucky with these girls  The guy's under the table, you know  He couldn't get laid if she let him, you know  Yeah, they probably think they're going to get lucky with him and stuff  Yeah, really, flat on his back  Drinking shot for shot with him  That's pretty hot, though  Girl band, all drunk  Deadly  Nice  Deadly  Cold  Back to doodling, Lemmy? 
[02:42:30]  No?  I'm waiting for him to make something out of that  And I would hope you'd sign it  Maybe we can make a couple of bucks  What are you drawing there?  It's a surprise  It looks like an instrument from India or a UFO  No  It looks like some kind of  Something that he's going to use to impale us  Are those teeth?  It's a very exotic junction box  Joining this and this  Okay  I have no idea what that is 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, why don't we go to the phones?  That's why they call them doodles  It's a doodle  All right  We've got a lot of fans checking in  A lot of fans  You do?  Yeah, let's say hi to Hindu  He's calling all the way from Iowa  Lemmy  Iowa?  Oh wait, you're going to have to throw those sort of on  Or to the side of your ear there  Hindu, what do you got for Lemmy, man?  Yeah, Lemmy  Hello  Hey, you got me?  Yeah  How you doing?  You on there, bro?  Yeah, I am  Hey, man  I've been having an argument with a buddy of mine for just like over 10 years 
[02:43:30]  And I saw you on Tom Snyder on the Tomorrow Show like in 75  He swears, tells me that you never made any appearance in the U.S.  He's arguing with me, it was on Saturday night special, or midnight special with Wolfman Jack  And I know you did that show, but we just had this stupid argument for, you know, for years  Wanting to know if that was any true  I'm probably wrong  Is this guy trying to settle an old bet that involves Tom Snyder on our show, sir? 
[02:44:00]  How dare you?  And Wolfman Jack  We never did his show live, we never were on his show, Wolfman Jack, I've got to tell you  I guess you're lost  Yeah, he's gone  Let's go to Travis  You were better off before you asked me  Yeah  I don't know why we had to take that phone call  Let's say hi to Travis in Nebraska  Travis, what's going on, man?  We've got Lemmy  Hey, I'm Joe and A, big fan  Thank you  Lemmy  Yeah  Love you in Airhead, man

Yeah  Yeah  Are you going to hang out with Lemmy and doodle?  Yeah  Oh, you don't doodle in the Rainbow  They frown upon that  Maybe in the bathroom  Yeah, maybe  Oh, maybe  Are you going to go down to the Rainbow and hang out? 
[02:45:00]  No  I don't know  Oh  Yeah, we'll look for you  What's your name?  Travis  Thank you, Travis  You gamble at all, Lemmy?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  But I play slot machines, you know  Oh, slot machines?  This place is no good to me  That's an old woman's thing to do  No, it isn't  Yeah  Not if you're a young guy  You've got to play like poker or blackjack  If you're a young guy, it's a young guy's thing  Oh  What's the matter with you?  He's making some subtle sense  Yeah, I understand  I do a lot of that  Yeah  Yeah  You play the slot machines 
[02:45:30]  But no card games, no poker or blackjack or nothing like that?  You know that you have room for human error in card games  You like the machines?  Yeah  You really get into the slot machines  Because there's not many people win at the slots  Yeah  I won nine grand on one pull in Vegas once  Really?  Yeah  Not bad  Not bad  I might see you do it  I'll give it a shot, I guess  Steve's saying he goes to Vegas  Steve seems to know a lot about Lemmy  Yes  You go to Vegas a lot there, Lemmy?  Not a lot, you know, every now and again 
[02:46:00]  Yeah  That one should be six months  You play there at all?  You ever play in Vegas?  Yeah, we've played there  Isn't that odd that like Vegas is a place?  You wouldn't think years ago that Vegas would be a place that Motorhead would play  Why?  I don't know  Vegas is always like the lounge act kind of place  Years ago it had that whole thing  Elvis  Yeah  Paul Anker  We first played there in 81 with Ozzy Osbourne, you know, and the Aladdin  Really?  Yeah  And it wasn't odd?  There weren't people in the audience going, oh, I thought I was going to see Barry Manilow  No, they were in the Barry Manilow part of the show 
[02:46:30]  Again, he's making some subtle sense here  Well, yeah, you know, I mean, obviously there's people who are at this show because they want to see you, you know  I mean, the billboard's outside, nobody walks in there by mistake like that  Absolutely, I understand  Absolutely  Did you think Motorhead would be around still when you first got together?  You think, here we are, 2005, that you'd still be rocking?  I gave it three years, I feel lucky, you know  Really?  Yeah  And then it just kept going?  Yeah, well, if you don't give up, they have to let you keep going, you know, I suppose 
[02:47:00]  Well, that's true, you've got a pretty loyal fan base  The secret of life, not dying, right?  Jack and Coke seem to help, I might have to join you with one of those, let me  Yeah, we could just sit here and just drink  And doodle  Let's say hi to Don in New Jersey, he wants to say hi to Lemmy  Don, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Is that Don on the phone?  Hey, Don  Fine, how are you?  Good, Lemmy  First time I saw you was like in 1980, you warmed up for Ozzy on the Blizzard of Oz store 
[02:47:30]  81  Yeah  81  You idiot  I just got tickets for you and COC in Zayerville at the Starland Ballroom next month, I can't wait  Good  Good to you  I hope it's a good show, it's the first show, it's going to be a bit ropey  Yeah, I love COC, man, they rule  Yeah  I can't wait to see you, though  They're one of the few bands who've been around as long as we are  COC is still out there doing it?  Yeah  Wow, man, they were  Hey, Lemmy  Yeah  Hey, Lemmy  Yeah  Oh, my God 
[02:48:00]  He had to do it  He really  I was like, hey, Mickey, run  Son of a bitch, I'm going to find you  Yeah, let's go to Mudflap, the trucker  Mudflap, what's going on, buddy?  Mudflap  He's laughing  Mudflap  Yeah  He's listening to his radio  Hey, man, yeah, turn down your radio, you're on with Lemmy  Hey, Lemmy, yeah, this is Mudflap  Hey, I just wanted to tell you about that song that you have, Eat the Wretches  Because, like, me and my friend were talking a little while ago 
[02:48:30]  And we were talking about that song  And he was saying, like, yeah, can you believe it?  They're still around  I'm like, you know  He's trying Norton's gag, and he's doing it poorly  Yeah, don't try Norton's gag  There's, like, four or five people that want to try Norton's gag  How many dates you do a year, Lemmy?  How many what?  How many gigs you play in a year?  I don't know, we're at about seven months of the year, usually  Seven months of the year?  That's a pretty rough schedule, man  You know, when you think  You know, you're not a kid anymore  But, even though you act like one  Although, neither are you 
[02:49:00]  I know, I'm going to say that  But that's why I'm not out seven months a year, you know  Yeah, I couldn't do this  It's driving me crazy  You do this every day, you know  It drives me fucking weak  See, there you go  Got to get out of doing this, man  Got to get out of this  Strap on the mic  And just, you know, plow through the shit one more time  Yeah  Plaster a smile on your face  You don't have to smile on the radio, you know  Didn't anybody tell you that?  That's true  Anthony was in the tournament yesterday, Lemmy  Yeah?  Yeah, I was playing in the poker tournament  That's why we're out here  And he did pretty well  Oh, so that's where the macho card game thing came from 
[02:49:30]  Macho card game thing, yeah  Rabid poker players, you know  Don't like them sissy slot machines  Well, you know, poker's taken over the world  I don't see TV shows  If you're surprised how little it's taken over the world  Actually, it's taken over America, probably  Stupid America, right, Lemmy?  No, it's stupid America  They don't play poker in other countries, you know  Yeah  But they're not like  They don't have TV shows about the slot machines yet  Not yet  Believe me  Celebrity slot machine tour  That'd be fun  Someone out there will figure it out 
[02:50:00]  There's a show on  Tonight on Fox, matter of fact  TV's just getting out of  Well, out of control, hello  But it's getting ridiculous, I should say  They're doing a show on Fox tonight  It's called Celebrities Without Makeup  Without Makeup, yeah  They're showing people  Well, they must be stuck for a show, huh?  Exactly  That's what I was thinking  I thought it was a goof  A slow news day  Yeah, I was getting ready to come down here  To do the, you know, the radio show  And they had commercials for this thing  I swear to God  I thought I was watching a rerun  Of, like, Saturday Night Live or something  Right  And it was a big commercial  And it was a goof commercial  I know  And they realized, no, it's real 
[02:50:30]  They're just going to show pictures of celebrities tonight  Without their makeup on  Well, the more dumb it is, you know  The more real it's going to be  You know, you can bank on that  We Americans love stupid television, Lemmy  Apparently  We don't like, you know, the clever stuff  Like Benny Hill  I know  Stuff like that  Benny Hill  Yeah, the smart stuff  I know  Do you guys just laugh at Americans every so often?  You're on stage  And you just look out and go  These stupid Americans  I don't laugh at Benny Hill  I'll tell you that  I stopped laughing at him when I was 12  And even then I was forcing it off the time 
[02:51:00]  Yeah  I never liked Benny Hill much  I liked Monty Python, yeah  Now that was very funny  But he had to put a laugh track on it  Before America got it  We are so stupid over here  In this country  It's just different  It's not  Yeah  We have to be shown when to laugh  With the English humor  Because we don't really understand it  Mind you, so do most other countries  Sometimes we're laughing  And we probably shouldn't be  And other times we're not laughing  And we should be  Well, you know, take your pick  Benny Hill used to like to dress up  In women's clothing  Yeah, I know  Very good, Kenny  And you weren't very cute either 
[02:51:30]  No, not at all  You must be the worst transvestite  You've ever seen in your life  You guys, they're not caught up  With the sex thing overseas there  Yeah, you show the boobs and stuff  On regular TV, right?  Yeah  Yeah, over here it's a  On page three of the most popular  National newspaper  Yeah  If that happened here, forget about it  People lose their minds  In the New York Times  Oh, yeah  The whole Janet Jackson thing  You guys must have laughed at us  Silly  Yeah, absolutely  Silly  I mean, that boob is on TV  For an eighth of a second 
[02:52:00]  Who cares?  Do you know what I mean?  And you guys over there  You've got boobs on TV all the time  You think it was like  Treason or spying or something  Right  Why is America so uptight, Lemmy?  It's religion  Is it the religion, you think?  A lot of people have this guilt thing  About sex and the body  Because of religion  It's not like we're exclusive to religion  They're pretty religious over there  In England, too  No, they're not  No?  I thought they were  Where am I getting my information from?  Somebody religious?  I would think 
[02:52:30]  I was under the impression  There were religious people  All around the globe  Well, there are  I didn't think it was just  In the United States  But why are we so uptight  About things like sex  When, you know  Well, they're more  Ray Ridley fanatic in America  You know, I mean  I'll give you an example  We were on tour  With Wendy O. Williams  A few years back, right?  Mm-hmm  And outside the gig in California  In Southern California  Advanced Southern California  Right  We got Mohicans for Jesus  Outside  All with Mohican haircuts  Jesus  And wearing a cross  On the front of them 
[02:53:00]  The devil is in this ballroom  You know what I mean?  Wow  So, I mean, at this point  I just, you know  Pull up your hands  And say goodnight  How do you argue that?  That's too ridiculous  To even talk about  You know  You couldn't even discuss shit  With them  Look at them  That is  Yeah  How are you going to sit down  And have a rational conversation  With these people?  I mean, you know  You look at them  You crack up laughing anyway  Before you  And they're trying to sell you God  You know  Like, oh, yeah  Good  Wow  You ever have to take any guff  From any of these religious groups  Thinking, you know  You're Satan  And spreading the music  Of the devil? 
[02:53:30]  No, we don't get a lot of that  No  No, you don't?  Well, we sing  We sing about murder and war  And sex  Which is mostly okay  Except for the sex bit  Right  They haven't really zeroed in on us yet  Isn't that odd  That the killing and stuff  Is perfectly acceptable  But for some reason  Sex  Just how much blood  You've got all over the screen  Yeah, like every night on TV  That's okay  You can tune in the news  And see piles of dead bodies  But for some reason  If their young child  Walks in the room  And you see half a breast  They lose their minds  Yeah  And that's, you know  A beautiful thing  It's really weird  Yeah, I don't get it 
[02:54:00]  I think we should just sit back  Drink more Jack and Cokes  Rock to some Motorhead  And get your tits out  And get your tits out  Damn it  I love your philosophy  Why not, you know  We should take a little break  We're hanging with Lemmy  We'll take a breather  Lemmy needs another drink  No, Lemmy  Cool  I'm still on the first one  Thanks  But doing pretty well  You can get me another one  If you like  Alright, we'll get you another drink  I like that  I might join Lemmy  As a matter of fact  Yeah  Mix me up a Jack and Coke  I'm going to have my first  On-air drinks  Since we've been on XM  And we'll be hanging with Lemmy 
[02:54:30]  From Motorhead  Sure  I'm going to be like my guitarist  And drink with Lemmy  And pass out  Well, I'm supposed to be working  Alright, and they are beginning  The final round of the  World Poker Tour  Yes, they are  You can just feel the excitement  In this room  You just  Lemmy's laughing  Dude, Lemmy's with me  I can't believe you  Televised a card game  This whole thing is a joke  Right, Lemmy?  No!  Listen, I wonder about  Televised golf  You know, never mind poking  Hey, chill out with the golf 
[02:55:00]  I like watching the golf  See, silly  Good luck  See, silly  Now people are into this  You knock a little ball  Into a hole with a piece of iron  And wood  And then you walk after it  I mean, I say  If you get it in the hole  First time  Take it in your pocket  And go to the clubhouse  You go  Leave  It's a mission accomplished  Why do it another  17 times?  But golf is very relaxing  On a Sunday to watch  You have it in the background  Drinking some coffee  You just go for a walk  In the country  I guess you're right about that  That's true  Why?  You don't have to keep  Whacking that stupid ball  And it's not all manicured 
[02:55:30]  But watching people  Play poker on TV  Is stupid  You know what it is?  It's almost like  A game show environment  On TV  You're watching it  You're rooting for somebody  And then you see their cards  You see what they have  You're seeing if they're  Bluffing each other  I find it compelling to watch  You do?  Yeah, I do  He's getting kind of into it  He's embarrassing everybody  He's getting his pictures  Taken with these guys  The card players  That are very excited  He just likes to meet  Rich people  That would be nice  You know  You meet some of these people  I see them on television 
[02:56:00]  They're celebrities too  Not in the same light  As Lemmy from Motorhead  But they play cards  You know  And they're famous  In their own way  Well I play cards  Can they play bass?  That's the thing  Probably not  They probably can't  Probably a few of them can  Not like you  Statistically  Probably a few of them  Must be able to  But you never know  Who do you find  Good bass players?  That are out there  These days  Well the best one ever  Was John Entwistle  Yeah  God rest him  God rest John Entwistle  Well I mean  Or whoever rest him  You know  I mean he wasn't that keen  On God either  Thank you  No swizzle stick? 
[02:56:30]  What do you want  A swizzle stick?  Are you going to swizzle?  I want to swizzle  A little before I drink  Don't swizzle in front of Lemmy  Don't swizzle in front of  The huge radio audience  I just  Don't swizzle  That's good  A knife is good  Wow  Steve do swizzle sticks  That's a swizzle knife  Who made this?  It certainly looks  A little pale  Why is my drink  Lighter than Lemmy's?  My drink is lighter  Than Lemmy's  Don't swizzle  In front of Lemmy  Let me take it  No I'll take this one  Ah  Perfect  Oh that's good  No that's good  Very good  Yeah 
[02:57:00]  That was  Wow they're just giving you  Oh wow  Wow now they just gave you  A tongue look  This is like poker  I've just been raised  By Lemmy  They put a bigger glass  In front of him  I'm sitting here  With the small  I got the short stack  With your little swizzle  And a little straw  You got a little swizzle though  And look  Lemmy's got  Lemmy is dual swizzling  In that glass right there  That's better  And Lemmy's just  Are you like the bigger one?  I have to drink yours?  No you don't have to  Alright  Lemmy why don't you just use  The huge glass you got  In the front of your pants  I don't have a glass  In the front of my 
[02:57:30]  Whoa  Lemmy you got it  It certainly looked like  A tumbler  It's a bottle  You keep a spare bottle  A jacket  Long neck goes down better  Well I mean the guys  We're discussing  That you might have  A huge hog  Might do  Are you one of those  Occasionally I do  Yeah when the stimulation  Is sufficient  Well we had Deacon Jones  On the show yesterday  He's an NFL great  You remember Deacon Jones  Back in the day  No  Mind you I'm not a football fan  Oh NFL  Alright I'm sorry  But he was bragging  That he had a 15-16 incher  And not that hooligan football  That they play over there  In Europe  Sucker  The thing is 
[02:58:00]  Did he show you?  He goes I'll whip it out  Well go ahead then man  But he didn't  And it's not  It's not because it's a  It's a gay thing  It's like more of a freak show  You got to check out a  Freak show  You got to check out a  15-16 incher right  You're not going to want to see it  In any sexual manner  But you got to see it  As like looking at Nessie  Or something  Yeah  Nessie  It's like a sideshow thing  I'll pay my 50 cent  The same effect really  Right  It sort of pokes its head up  And it's back in  It eats grass  You know  People take photos of it  You throw peanuts at it  You know 
[02:58:30]  Excuse me Lemmy  Hey Jumbo  Alright  Lemmy  You know  What has a hundred teeth  And holds back a monster  Yeah  You're zipper  Yeah  You got that one  Very much correct  That's as old as I am  I've been in a coma  Yeah I know  Alright well  Lemmy  I don't know about  Lemmy's  Any of the mythology  That goes behind Lemmy  But are you known  For a huge schlong  In the groupie community  Or anything  Like I know  What are the rock stars  That have known  Hendrix had one  Hendrix was known  To have a big one  Yeah you used to hang 
[02:59:00]  With Hendrix right  I used to work for him  You used to work for him  What did you do  I used to just lift  Equipment and shift it  From place to place  Yeah  A roadie for Hendrix  You must have seen  Some stuff then right  Oh yeah  Back in the day  Well it was a lot more fun then  Yeah  It's a lot of business now right  Keep it drugs  No AIDS  You know  Lots of fun  That's true  Unlimited whoopee basically  If you could get away  From the OD's  It was pretty much  Safe role  There wasn't many people  OD'd  I mean Hendrix didn't OD  Choked on his own vomit  Which is very very different  I think you'll agree  I don't know 
[02:59:30]  Is it really different  Or did he choke  Because he was  In the fact that  Death is the outcome  No it's not  Yeah  I'm talking bottom line  Here Lemmy  The chemical kills you  You know  True  Okay  It didn't do that  It was an accident  It shouldn't have happened  But all that banging  Without rubbers  And not worrying about it  Well there's nothing to worry about  I've got to be great  Except pregnant  You know  Yeah  Oh and then they come back years later  Well he's used a rhythm method  Apparently I couldn't keep a beat  Because I have two kids  You know  Very good Lemmy 
[03:00:00]  Alright we're going to hang with Lemmy  And just get drunk  Because there's nothing else to do here  Well no you're not drinking  Oh that's a good one  I got  I'm going to throw something in my coffee  Maybe I don't know  Yeah  A little splash in there  A little something something  A sugar lung person  We're hanging with Lemmy from Motorhead  Obviously  What is Steve bringing in now  Clown porn guys are here  No that's Jeff  No I know  I remember Jeff  No that's just more porn  More porn  Great  Jesus  We got  They bring us pornography

[03:02:30]  Spank the girls  There was  Oh he likes her  I believe  He loves to spank girls  And there was this girl  Peaches  That he really worked over  It was great  Her ass was like  As red as these chairs  You like that do  It was cool to watch  Triple H liked it  Definitely  It wasn't bad at all  And then he goes off  And gets married  To Stephanie  Who we know pretty well too  And now he's not allowed  To do the spanking  When he comes in  Gotta kick your ass  Well you know  Stephanie's probably  Doing it all now  Yeah  Getting that big meaty hand  Of his on the ass  I like how your guy 
[03:03:00]  Is just all business  Bringing over your gig dates  And stuff  Making sure you get those across  Yeah  Is that what that is  Get a couple of them across  Plug a few  Yeah why not  I mean you can't wait  To hear about the gig  In Albuquerque  Right  Albuquerque New Mexico  Come on  Lemmy  Is there a party scene  In Albuquerque  You'd be surprised  Actually  In those places  You make your own amusement  You know  Yeah that's true  You know  If there's not much to do  Motorhead comes to town  You go to the  Motorhead show  Hell yeah  It's more of an event  For them see  What did you do  Did you go to the Grammys 
[03:03:30]  Did you accept your award  Yeah  But they didn't televise  That a bit  Where the  The hoi polloi  You know  Where the poor people  Like peasants  Well because it's rock and roll  They don't like that  They're trying to kill it again  You know  They put all this crap up there  Lemmy wins a god damn Grammy  You can't get up there  And you know  They were probably scared  Of what you might say  Too  You know  I said  Thank you very much  You've got a lucky face  Well there you go  That's not bad  Suitably perplexing  Suitably perplexing 
[03:04:00]  It's not like you cursed  Or anything  Because god forbid  You know  You hear any language  On television  You know  That's  They'll be fining you  Millions of dollars  Actually I don't believe  God forbid cursing  Did he  I can't find it in the book  You know something  Now that I think about it  That doesn't make much sense  God forbid  Yeah  God didn't forbid cursing  Yeah you didn't thank god  Or anything  When you accepted your award  No  That's funny  The porno awards  AVN awards  You get this chick  Got nominated for a gangbang  With seven guys  And she's  I'd like to thank god  And my parents  Yeah  Mom and dad  They never pan over  To the proud dads 
[03:04:30]  Sitting in the audience  In the audience  It's just like the Oscars  I think it's funny as shit  Yeah I'd like to thank my father  For touching me  When I was a kid  And sending me into this  Spiral of  For making me guilty  So you're playing Albuquerque  Where else  There let me  The Walton Theater  Like I said  First of April  And then the House of Blues  In Anaheim  Oh that'll be cool  House of Blues  Those clubs are great  Yeah they are  And the House of Blues  In Vegas  The day after that  We just saw Greg Allman 
[03:05:00]  At the House of Blues  In New Orleans  Yeah  That's a good club too  Do you hang out  With any of the  Classic rockers  Or are they another group  Where you're like  Well they're mostly boring  You know  Some of them  Have really gone  Like soft  Like you are still  Kicking ass  And playing  You know  The same roots of music  That when you started  Right  But some of these guys  Like I saw  Years ago  I was such a huge  Blue Oyster Cult fan  And I went to go see them guys  Why is he laughing  Years ago  Back in the you know 
[03:05:30]  Mid late 70s  Stuff like that  I love those guys  I saw them in concerts  So many times  You know  And just blasting out  You know  Rocking  Really cool  I saw them recently  You know  Within a few years  At some small venue  And it was like  They were doing  Muzak versions  Of their songs  You know  Everything's turned way down  A medley of our greatest hits  Yeah  Medley of greatest hits  It's all low volume  You know  People are sitting there  And the crowd  Chicken in the basket  Yeah pretty much  You know  Going out to get  Some refreshments  To bring back to their seat 
[03:06:00]  And you know  I understand  These are old guys  And stuff  But it's  You know  So it might be  You don't have to  Let it get you down  Right  You're still out there  On stage rocking  You know  Really fast  The saddest story I got  I saw Robbie Krieger  By himself  In a small club  On Long Island  I think it was called  Christopher's or something  Remember that joint  I remember that place  It was maybe  Maybe could fill  A hundred people  At the club  Okay  People were playing pool  And they had a hockey game on  While Robbie Krieger  Was in the corner playing  And people are screaming 
[03:06:30]  And yelling  When you know  The Islanders  See that shows  Bud Manor  Isn't it  Yeah  Well and  They had the volume up  On the TV a little bit  And every time the Islanders  Scored  The place is cheering  And there's Robbie Krieger  You know  A legend  To many  Yeah  In the corner  Just kind of eating it  Man  Well see  He shouldn't have ate it  He should have done the gig  He should have just walked off  Right  There were some gigs  It was very sad  I remember doing some gigs though  Where we'd be out playing  And you get done with the song  And you hear the crowd  Really cheering  And you feel good  And you look  And they were watching  Something on TV  And it's like 
[03:07:00]  Oh fuck this man  Well there's some places  You've just got no fucking class at all  You know  It's just no point in going there  Yeah  Might as well just stay home  And get broke  And then we had  We had a story  Break your heart  And the place like that  Yeah  You do leave feeling a little bad  About yourself  Yeah  We had a story  We had a story last week  That there's a cruise ship  That has sticks  REO Speedwagon  And  Journey  And Journey  There's a thought  Can you imagine  Trapped on a ship  With all three of them  Yeah  And these people are signing up  To go on these cruises  With these  You know  Quote classic rock bands 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  And then the bands  Hang out with you  At the buffet line and stuff  Can you imagine  How good would that ship  Look in the periscope  Of a U-boat  Yes  Right  So U-149  What did you get just done  Oh  Just a couple of torpedoes  Slammed into the side  Of that vessel  Yeah  Watch them  Jumping off  With their mullets  You'd probably think  It was an advert  For Motley Crue  You know  Want to see my torpedo baby  You know  You can hear the churn  In the background  Yeah I know  I'm hearing  There must be some action  Taking place  But I'm looking at the scene 
[03:08:00]  I guess they're just  Introducing people  Norman Schwarzkopf  Just arrived or something  Is he playing poker  Probably  Everybody else is apparently  What do you got there  Steve  Steve with more information  Steve  Wow  Steve's very excited  That Lemmy's here today  Why don't you ask him yourself  Yeah  Yeah go ahead Steve  Oh okay  No I just  Sorry Lemmy  Play the game  That's right  No I was actually  I wanted to bring up  That Steve Vai  Played guitar on  Lemmy's  On Motorhead's  Latest album  Yeah he did  Really  That's pretty badass  And my phone's  Going off again  Haven't heard from 
[03:08:30]  Haven't heard from  Steve in a while  Yeah well he's still around  He's on tour right now  Is he  Yeah  Knocking around  Yeah he kind of  Fell off the face of the earth  For a while  One of those guys  It was huge you know  He's playing  He's doing those 3G things  You know the three guitar players  Yeah  Oh really  Him and Satriani  And whoever else  You know  In Bay Malmsteen sometimes  The three tenors  Is that what that is  Yeah I like that  I like that  Only completely different  I don't like just guitarists  You know  I just  I don't like a solo  That goes on for the whole song 
[03:09:00]  I like a  Thank you  The words you've done  I know  I hate that  That and like  Long drum solos  I'm glad they got away  From that shit  Well we have a long drum solo  But only because we got a drummer  Who like does a good one  But let me  Let me tell you something  I've seen really good drum solos  It's still a drum solo  I know  For drummers  It's like the greatest thing  You sit there  And like you're completely fixated  Everyone else is  You know  Let's get out and get the beer  You know  This is different  Come and see us  Is it really?  Yeah  You come and see us  Anaheim or Wilton  Or Vegas  Or Albuquerque  And I'll make you eat your stick words 
[03:09:30]  Or rather Mickey will  I knew right when I said it  That he was going to have a drum solo thing  I've never been into the drum solos  Neither have I  Believe me  Neither have I  But when we got Mickey  It was too good to let go  You know what I mean  We had to do it  We had to feature it  Although the band  You're familiar with  Of course  Godsmack  You know Godsmack  Those guys  Oh I know their name  Yeah  They do a great drum solo  Because it's a little different  You know  Yeah  It's like two guys  Squaring off two drummers  The singer also drums  So  I believe  Phil Collins does a very nice 
[03:10:00]  Solos sounds like two guys  But it's just Mickey  Yeah  But I want to ask Steve something  Where's the clown people?  Clown people have  Obviously  Lemmy would enjoy something like that  I know  Well we got  There's all sorts of porn out there  Right Lemmy  There's  He's sperm overdose  Look at three  Jesus  Because one and two  Left so many unanswered questions  I know  Wait we got more porn  Jeff just  Jeff actually used to work with Lemmy  And so he was excited that  That Lemmy was here  But in honor of it  He brought all of his porn  Sperm overdose three 
[03:10:30]  Sperm overdose three  Five guy cream pie fifteen  Wow  Jesus Christ  That's a good one  A load in every hole  Please give it up  This is really some  This is really subtle  But the one I wanted to bring up with him  Is the clown clown  A lot of mystery  You're not sure what you're getting  Clown porn  Clown porn  Clown porn  Clown porn was basically  These guys  These young guys  That figured out  That they could make porn  More interesting  By dressing the girls up 
[03:11:00]  In clown suits  It wasn't anything  Too graphic or vulgar  But they dressed them up  In clown suits  And then at the end  Every scene  They would bash these girls  In the face  With cream pies  Wow  That is the dumbest  That's almost as dumb  As televised poker  I'm with you Lemmy  I'm with you  Come on now  There's something to be said  For this  I'd rather watch paint dry  Yeah right  Listen to somebody  Check your shins  I don't know  I dig it  These guys are starting  To walk around  Like rock stars  You sit and watch that 
[03:11:30]  Do you at home?  At home  Absolutely  I sit and watch  I know the names  I know  Why don't you get  Three guys around  And play it yourself  And play poker?  At least you're  Going to win some money  That way  You know what  It's almost like  People that sit  And watch baseball  You know you could get out  And get a game together  With your friends  It's not quite the same  You're watching a crowd  Of millions  And all that  But it's not going to be  As compelling  Playing the game  Because you're not as good  And you haven't got  That much money  And you don't have  That much money  Very good  But you know  To watch the professionals  And the best of the best  Sit there and play poker 
[03:12:00]  Against each other  And especially a game like  No Limit Hold'em  Where it's a lot more strategy  Than just the luck of the draw  It's compelling  What's the big attraction  A good bluff  Right?  Where they sit there  And look at the other guys  And the other guys  Look back at them  And maybe they fool them  And maybe they don't  If you're watching a guy  And you see that  He really doesn't have  A good hand  And the other guy  Has got a pretty good hand  And through the betting  The guy with the lousier hand  Makes the guy with the good hand  And he never sweats  Yeah never  That's compelling  It's compelling  His eyes stay still  Right  They stay still 
[03:12:30]  No sweating  He's not smiling  He's keeping what they call  That poker face  It's that old stone face  It's kind of compelling  That's compelling television  If you like  Mr. Lemmy  Give me John Wayne  Any fucking day  Mr. Lemmy  What do you like to do  For fun?  Oh  I like to chase girls  I like to catch girls  That's what is better  He's all about getting laid  Kenny  He already said that  It's drinking  I don't get that long left  You know  I gotta make the most of it  You got plenty of years left  Drinking  Kicking ass on stage  Oh you've been talking to God 
[03:13:00]  That's right  And chasing broads  You're not scared to die  You've probably seen a lot of your compadres die  Right?  Sure yeah  Well the hard life living you know  Do you use condoms?  No Joey Ramone died of lymphoma  Yeah  Nothing to do with it  You know  Sir do you use condoms?  Do you have safe sex?  Yeah I'm gonna pull one over my head  And go rob a fucking bank  Makes more sense  He uses them 
[03:13:30]  Just not for that  Right?  Sure  You figure  You know  Even if you got AIDS now  Takes what  20 years?  Well  Five tops  You know what I mean  I'm 59 now  What have I got to fucking  By that time  You know  Who cares  Right?  They got the super AIDS though now  I think you go for broke  Yeah there were  Stories in the paper  About super AIDS  So even Superman  Is inside  It's kryptonite and AIDS  Kryptonite and AIDS  Two things now  That Lex Luthor could hit him with  Kryptonite  Or  Screw him in the ass 
[03:14:00]  Well he always wore his underpants  Outside his clothes  I thought  That was kind of strange  A little weird there  A bit of a poof  And that cloak  You know  That cape thing  You know  What is it with superheroes  And capes  Who cares that?  You know  You try wearing one  In the streets  How far you get  You know  Down Santa Monica  Maybe he's trying to  Get into a fight  Right?  Superman was here yesterday  Where are you going tonight?  I'm gonna break up  No capes  Whoops  I want my cape  You know  I don't know  Kind of dangerous  Man you know  Well I was gonna ask him 
[03:14:30]  About movies  But  You probably  Have you seen a movie lately?  I ask because the Oscars  Are  You know  Just like  A little different part of Lemmy  I know about the Rock  And the Broads  And stuff  And the Boos  But you know  You like movies?  You like  Sure  You know  What have you seen lately  That you enjoyed?  Maybe Lemmy's movie  I just re-watched  Scarface again  That's a great one  That's so funny  You know  That's such a great character  It's such a bad Spanish accent  You know  I don't think that movie  Holds up 
[03:15:00]  It's a little dated  I don't think it's supposed  To be really true life  No I know  But I mean  Some of these movies  You can see The Godfather  And Goodfellas  And Goodfellas  There's all those movies  They hold up  But I'm telling you  Something about Scarface  It was the Cuban mafia  But the violence  It looks really fake  The blood looks fake  It looks dated  It looks very dated  You know what I mean?  I just saw  That's when I enjoyed it  First time  So I'm enjoying it again  I like Casino  Casino and Goodfellas  Two of the best movies  Joe Pesky and Casino  Was one of the meanest  Motherfuckers  I've seen in my life 
[03:15:30]  And he really gets it in the end  I bet he's a really nice guy  Too in real life  Yeah so we here  I just saw Raging Bull  And that movie holds up  That holds up  For the most part  You know  I can believe De Niro  Some of the jabs look fake  But in the fighting  The trouble he went to  De Niro  Put on all that weight  And then drop it again  I'm so annoyed  With him these days man  His movie choices  Just blow  It's like classic  Some of these classic movies  That if you're  Rattling around the channels  And one of these come on  You don't care  If it's half way through  You're watching the rest of it  The movies he's coming out with  Now the guy isn't even thinking 
[03:16:00]  He's just like cashing a check  And it pisses me off  Possibly  Because I love  I love all the classic movies  Yeah you think  God knows he's done enough for us  I guess  I would rather  You know  Remember De Niro  For the good movies  And some of the crap  He's putting out  Well done  What's the new ones  I guess  Maybe I'll do that  That's all you can do  I just won't watch it  That's all you can do  That's all you can do  That's all I can do  That's all you can do  That's all we can do  Did you watch  I'm like such a fag  I'm drinking out of my little straw  I know  You're supposed to throw it away  After you stir it  I'm trying to be cool  And hang out with Lemmy 
[03:16:30]  You see you're swizzling  Even though you're halfway through it  You're right  I'm a swizzling faggot  You're swizzling  He's pounding  What a rotten swizz  You're drinking from a straw  I'm taking small little sips  With my pinky out  I know  It's syndicable  Did you see any new movies  Like from the past year  Like Passion of the Christ  Or any of those  No  It wouldn't be a bad idea  To see somebody  Kick the shit out of Jesus  For an hour and a half  But it's never been done  Has it  I went with my dad  It's never been done though  No  You always see the crucifixion 
[03:17:00]  It seems that's the first thing  You see  He never gets all that torture  Because they did torture him  He's pretty much in good shape  When they put him up there  I thought he was very well adjusted  For an only child  You know  I like his religious views  I don't have religious views  Not a very religious guy  Are you there Lemmy  Listen  I don't believe  That you could follow that  It's a thin story  You know what I mean  A virgin gets pregnant by a ghost  And then she goes home  And says  I'm still a virgin darling  But I'm pregnant  And he goes for it  You know 
[03:17:30]  You think she's just making a story  I still live in a stable  You know what I mean  You figure she was just making up a story  To cover up  Right  I really have no idea  I didn't know the lady  But it seems kind of strange to me  You know  Yeah  Passion of the Christ  Did you see it?  I saw it with my dad  And he cried through the whole thing  And I'm sitting there thinking  This is the biggest piece of crap  I've ever seen  Uh huh  Really  So there's the generation  Got for you  Obviously yeah  Because he's a lot more religious  Well he was a lot more religious than I  He was  Why 
[03:18:00]  Well he passed  Oh so now he's found out  Finally  Well hopefully he's finding out right now  Yeah  I hope it wasn't a disappointment  Yeah  Yeah  I'm wondering  I would love to know  But I don't know  It was just a movie of  Just someone getting beat up  The whole  I mean  I know  So I mean  What does that tell you about Mel Gibson  How many ways can we think of  To torture this poor long head bastard  He likes action movies  Before we stick a crown of thorns on him  And nail him to a piece of wood  No it's very nice  I get it  Control the family  It was like I get it  He was abused really bad 
[03:18:30]  Before they threw him up on the cross  But he wanted to show it all  We get it  We understand  Thank you  Mel Gibson was great in that one  He wasn't in it  Yes he was  Was he?  Yeah  Was he the guy with the nails?  Yeah his fist was in it  He was the one that  How can you tell he'd have a tattoo or something?  I don't know  No  I've read  Rest watch  It's a Rolex  This is how boring my life is  I read a whole article on it  It was his hand that  You know  Hit the last spike or whatever  See I knew it would be the nail scene 
[03:19:00]  I knew it  Do you mind crushing the legs  But he's only got one nail left  You know  Alright we gotta wrap up the Lemmy interview  Alrighty  Because you gotta go  They're saying  Have we?  Lemmy?  Who said that?  Once again  Do we have to go?  No  Don't you go  You just want to get rid of me  Because I'm not religious  No I don't want to get rid of you  See you offended his religion  So he's trying to kick you out of here  Not at all  These zealots  I gotta note that  No?  These religious fantastic  What Steve? 
[03:19:30]  It was his fault  Lemmy  Oh him  Yeah  What was the problem?  Dan  What?  Dan I know we're boring but  No this guy  Jesus  Jesus  Did you turn the mic on?  No one of Lemmy's guys came up to me  And said we had 10 more minutes  And that was 10 minutes ago  But now  Now we're saying  Now we gotta do math?  What is that?  How many minutes are left?  10 minutes ago?  10 minutes?  Zero minutes  Right  But apparently  It was all a subterfuge  It was all subterfuge  Exactly  Of course it was  Trying to pull the wool over our eyes 
[03:20:00]  Yes  Alright why don't we take a break then  We're hanging with Lemmy from Motorhead  We're talking about  I don't know  I really don't know  Stuff  Stuff  Just life  We're just hanging out  Drinking with Lemmy  And hanging out  Talking about life  Talking about the special  You know  Relationship between poker players  And their audience  Exactly  And as I look up  I see they are  At their seats  Did you get a picture with that guy Anthony?  No that's  You know something  I don't know who a lot of these  Final table guys are  A lot of people made it through  That weren't the superstars  Except for you know  Jesus  Too much 
[03:20:30]  A guy named Jesus is playing by the way  Oh yeah  That's funny  Yeah  Well wouldn't he know if he won or not?  Not that  Jesus  Oh  You idiot  No I think Jesus' big thing was  He didn't win right?  That's his whole fascination  Turning his water into more chips  And cheating  A little upsetting to the rest of the players  I think  Alright well  Who's that?  That's the actor?  Oh yeah  One of the actors  One of the actors made it to the final table

[03:24:30]  I remember that  New York  And we had a contest  To send people to various locations  Around New York City  Places you know  FAO Schwartz  The Hard Rock Cafe  You know landmarks  To have sex  In a cab  And there would be a certain point value  That's a homeless guy  For each place  That they went to  And one of the places  You really fucked it up  One of the places  Was St. Pat's Cathedral  Great  Wonderful  And a couple went in there  And got burned as witches  Had sex 
[03:25:00]  Allegedly  The media picked up on it  And we were crucified  Good night Irene  It was done  Fire those idiots  We were on top of the radio world  Pretty much  And then you weren't  We blew it up  Yeah we blew it all up in one day  So as you come to a different coast  Oh no no  We're still out of New York  We're just here for the poker  Yeah right  We're here for the poker man  Anthony thought  Anthony thought  You know  He loves poker so much  That we had to come to LA  To watch  Come out here  Watch this  Look at this on TV

[03:27:00]  This is very  Or he's bluffing possibly  Could be  See  Jesus is bluffing  Whoever heard that before  See we don't know for sure  This is captivating  Believe me  Let me tell you what's going to happen too  We're going to get off the air  And Anthony's going to run into the other room  I might look in on it  He's not even going to say goodbye to you  I know  I want to get a picture with Lemmy  He's going to go before the end of the show  He's going to go here  Smile and go  If he could  I want to take a picture with Lemmy  If he could he would  Of course I'll be here  He would leave right now  I know  No I could see it here on the television  That's fine 
[03:27:30]  Trying to get on TV  And not down  Oh that's  I'll be behind him like waving  And the placa  And Jesus  Hi mom and chips  Jesus is now stacking up his chips  Are we supposed to be describing what's going on  Or the action  Wasn't that the big no no  They said don't describe what's going on  No I think we can't really describe who's out  If someone loses  And who's kicked out  Because they want to save that  But you can't describe  Stacking  We could describe any stacking  If somebody's stacked  You know  You could describe raises  Any bedding  Any folding  Anything you want  Folding 
[03:28:00]  You know  You know  If they want to make this good TV  How about spindling and mutilating  Don't spindle and mutilate the cards  They have to use them  If they want to make this good TV  They should get the dealer  You know  A hotter dealer  Yeah really  She's a mess  They're just there to serve a purpose  Deal the cards  Yeah but it's TV  No but it could look  I mean there's no law against looking good too  Is there  Right  Not at all  It's TV  It's a very visual thing  Yeah it's supposed to be the media isn't it  You know  I mean  I agree  They got a mess of a woman  Dealing the cards  Topless woman dealing  Yeah  That would now make the game  A little more exciting 
[03:28:30]  I have to agree with you  Yeah  And all topless people playing it too  Well I don't know  If I want to see these guys  Topless  No no no  Obviously not  The woman's rounds  Well you got to have one  Into the token  You know  They're the  Batting for the team market  You know  Get the gay audience  Sure  Sure  Right  And then there's the bestial audience  You have the donkey in there too  You know  Yeah well  The audience that brought over this  Pouring out of your face for us  Hey tell me  You know  There ain't no rules right  Well look at that  If you want to capture every audience  Which is what TV is trying to do so hard all the time 
[03:29:00]  I don't know why there isn't more bestiality on TV  Since there's all those bastards  Keep getting caught screwing cows and things  Again  The religion  There you go  You see  I think they frown on having sex  Because cows are not Protestants  You see  That's what it is  Is that what it is  Cows are mostly Catholic  I never knew that one  You never spoke to them  I've never spoken to a cow  You've had conversations with cows  Yeah you've heard of Irish Buddha  Haven't you  No  Catholic  What is this  I have no idea what Lemmy's talking about 
[03:29:30]  Wait Lemmy  What was that one  Roman Catholic cows  Roman Catholic cows  Yeah  Most of them are Catholic  I have no idea  You didn't know that  No  Cows are Catholic  You certainly do  Thank you for enlightening us with that one Lemmy  I must say Calvinist  Is Lemmy drunk  No  Please  You'd know if I was drunk  I'd fall to the ground  Cows give milk and meat  How many of those can you drink  In like  As many as it takes 
[03:30:00]  I drink all day  I don't get drunk anymore  Just pretty much drink all day  I like the flavor  You know  Like it's water  Just nothing  No I hate water  Yeah water  Fish fucking it  There are certain lines  You know there's a thin line  Between fishing  And just standing on the bank  Like an asshole  That's another sport  I don't believe fishing  You know  Yeah  And they show fishing  On TV  They do too  Yeah  Show that I wouldn't watch 
[03:30:30]  Pictures of the latest flying shit  You know  That I wouldn't watch  I've seen the fishing competitions  You know as you're flipping around the channel  And they're out there on the boat  People like in boats  Going  Yeah  This is a really good  You know  And then they show  Catch one  They say  Oh that's a big one  Yeah but we throw it back anyway  Because we're not cruel  Right right  Or sometimes they take it  They put it in the boat  And then they got to drive back  To some area where they weigh them  And whoever got the most fish wins  And it's like a big thing  They can be a big trophy  Big prize money  Yeah  Not that I watch it  Don't get me wrong  Well I watch the poker  I don't watch the fish  You watch that 
[03:31:00]  I can see shark fishing  Now that would be exciting  It's a little more exciting  Yeah  Because you get the chance  That the bastard will come on board  And know your arm off  You know  That's a little more  There's a little more  Yeah the fish has a little more  Of a shot at it  You got a fresh drink  That was just handed to you there  No it's only a fresh half a drink  Because I had half a drink left  I'm sorry  Okay  How about a show  Where they play poker  While they're fishing  While they're fishing  Yes  You know in between  Catching the fish  Getting a tug  Yeah  They could be playing cards  Thinking you got two audiences there  Yeah  And possibly also doing porn  At the same time 
[03:31:30]  Oh no  You could sneak in  Maybe as they're playing  They're watching  While they're dealing  You know  Tug and Rob  Various people on their knees  In the boat  Yeah  They're watching that sperm movie  Yeah  And playing cards  And the rod over their shoulder  There you go  One rod in front  Three and one  Yeah sure  Rod rod rod  I want to ask  I want to ask Lemmy  About aliens  Oh  Aliens  Aliens  What do you think  Are they amongst us  I think  You know  Most of them  Shouldn't have left Mexico  Really  Not illegals 
[03:32:00]  Peter Jennings  Is doing a show  On UFOs tonight  Big TV shows  Oh I'll tell you  If you like  I mean  UFOs  I'm going to get  A lot of flack for this  I've seen a UFO  In 1966  You saw a UFO  Along with three other people  Right  There's no mistake  You really did  It wasn't a reflection  Off the clouds  And it wasn't a flock  Of bloody seagulls  Going home for the night  It wasn't any of that  It was a UFO  They came across the horizon  Like a bad idol  And stopped dead  And nothing we had  Then does that  Nothing we got now  Does that  Did you just see light  Or was it a shape 
[03:32:30]  It was a pink light  And it stopped dead  And then it pulsed  For about ten minutes  We all got out the car  And watched it  And then it went  Wham over the horizon  To the right  And where was this  What state  I was in England  England  1966  The state of England  Where is that  The state of England  That's in New Hampshire  Isn't it  Somewhere over there  Wow  So that's  Yeah so I never had  To worry about it anymore  You know whether there was  Or there wasn't  Because I saw one  And I know I saw one  And I don't care  What anybody else's opinion  Is  Four of us saw it  Independent 
[03:33:00]  You know  I got to ask the obvious question  Were you guys like high  Or drunk  Before I even drank  That was  Wow  So you were an infant  At the time of the sighting  No  But I wasn't  I wasn't drinking  Or taking dope  You know  Nothing  When did you start drinking  1968  Right  I saw a UFO  It freaked me out  I started drinking  Two years later  Two years later  I would have started drinking  That night  I'd wait two years  After seeing the UFO  That's pretty cool  It's great  Well Peter Jennings  Is doing a whole special  I mean it's kind of arrogant 
[03:33:30]  To think that we're the only place  That supports life  Out of all the millions of worlds  Right  That's true  But it's kind of defeatist  To think that you know  We're the only ones  That can't get off the planet  And kind of visit the other ones  You know  Well we might not be  It's just that the ones  That can don't want us to  Yeah  Kind of creepy  If you think about it though  Why  They're able to come over here  And visit us  Well wouldn't you  We're just ants  Waiting for the magnifying glass  Well at least they haven't brought us  A nuclear war  Which is what we'd take to then  If we could get off  Well yeah  But they might laugh at our nukes 
[03:34:00]  Like  I've no doubt  Those earthlings and their nukes  Those nukes  You know  Our queens  Yeah they're  Antiquity  They're just much more  Remember when we were doing that shit  Yeah  Dude aliens are living amongst us  Are they?  Cats  Cats yeah  I used to call them spies  Yes  Spies  I knew it  I knew I wasn't the only one  There's something going on with cats  Cats are like spies  They just lie there and watch you  You know  Yeah I think  And you never get a thank you  From them  They never lick your fucking hand  Or jump up at you  Do they?  They do nothing 
[03:34:30]  But crap all day  You know an interesting story  I was reading  And they go meow  What kind of noise is that anyway?  It's got to be code  It's a cat noise  Yeah  Yeah  You hear in 1960  I believe it was  Yeah in the late 60s  A UFO actually  Flew back to base  And one of the aliens got out  And said  Holy shit  I saw Lemmy from Motorhead  Did you ever count with him?  Guys you'll never guess who I saw tonight  We were in England  We saw four guys get out of this vehicle 
[03:35:00]  Yeah one of them was Lemmy from Motorhead  I swear to you  No I wasn't  Then I was Lemmy from the Rockin' Vickers then  Rockin' Vickers?  The Reverend Black and the Rockin' Vickers  Was that the name of your band?  It was the name of that band  I joined it  Oh you joined?  What kind of music were you guys playing back then?  Rock and roll  You know  Bill Ailey songs  No kidding  Cover tunes yeah  What was that the name  Rockin' Vickers  In the Boogie Woogie Flu  We used to do that  Huey Piano Smith  Was it?  Wow  What made you go from that to this?  Well this is an extension of that 
[03:35:30]  Yeah  So called heavy metal  Is the logical extension  Of the original rock and roll  You know  What else is?  Right  Yeah it's kind of an evolution then  Yeah  If Eddie Cochran was 16 now  He'd be in a garage  Playing with the heavy metal band  You know  Right  On the Japanese copy of Giza  You know  No doubt  Yeah  What are some of the bands you like today?  I don't know  I mean I always  The mind goes blank  Whenever you ask me that  You know  Well that's like  That's that basic question  Do you know what I mean?  The thing closes down  Know it when you hear it though  You know  I've seen a few bands around  That are really good  But they never get on TV 
[03:36:00]  Or the radio  You know anymore  Because the radio  In this country unfortunately  Seems to be controlled  By five guys right?  Mmhmm  That's why satellite radio  Is taking off  That's right  I hope so  People have had it  They're fed up  Yeah  Because it's always like  There's so many advertisements  On it for a start  Yeah  It's like cripples  Commercials too  Yeah  Commercial adverts  Yes  I know  We're pretty sick of it  Adverts of a commercial nation  Advertisements and commercials  Both of them  Too many  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah we're pretty sick of 
[03:36:30]  Sick of regular radio  And this you can pretty much  Talk as freely as you want  Yeah you can curse  I don't think you can curse yet  Whatever language you want  What did you say?  Motherfucker  That would qualify  That's pretty good  That's one of my favorite ones  On the scale  That's one of my faves  That's in the top five  Yeah there's not much  You can say after that  Well there is  Oh there is  Well at the sea  There's the biggie  That's the atom bomb  We like to call that  The atom bomb  We got that word on TV once though  Lemmy  Really?  Yeah  It's usually  Wow that's progress  It's pretty common  Is there any religious preaching? 
[03:37:00]  Common in England though  They use common a lot  Yeah  Well they don't use motherfucker  Because that's an American one  And you know  Stupid America  Yeah  No I didn't say that  Did I?  You said that  You get a complex about this?  We're pretty stupid over here  He likes America  I agree with you  I like America  I live here 14 years now  Did you move here because of taxes?  No  They're pretty bad over there  I moved here because I like America  You like America?  Yeah  Really?  Even with all it's bad side  There's still a great good side to it  I made some of the best ones I ever had here 
[03:37:30]  I just would  I would find that weird to like  Live in another country like that  Why?  Because I heard an English  Because you haven't tried it yet  I haven't tried it  But I would feel very out of place  How long have you been an American  Are you an American citizen?  No  How long have you lived here in America?  14 and a half years  14 and a half years  Like that's a long  He's an American  Yeah  That's like of course you got your English rules  But I heard an English gentleman  Doing the traffic report  On the radio for New York  And it's like  Wow that's got to be weird 
[03:38:00]  You know he knows all the roads and everything  I don't know  He lives there?  Yeah because he lives  But I would think it would  I kind of think like going over to England  And trying to  He's foreign  Like know all the highways  Get him out of the helicopter  Yeah get him out of the helicopter  He doesn't know  He doesn't know the Long Island Expressway in New York  Get him out of here  Jesus I know that  I went to dinner with Dee Snider  You know Jesus  Yeah yeah  Dee lives out there  Yeah  That's a rough road to travel on  Well you know  It wasn't that hard  I took the bus  Dee likes the makeup though  He does apparently  He doesn't do the makeup anymore 
[03:38:30]  Well not while he's eating dinner  You know  He's actually  He's a great guy  His wife had someone  And a kid  Yeah  But not Dee himself  He was playing hard to get I think that night  What do your kids do?  You said you had two right?  One's a producer and guitar player  The other one apparently is a computer programmer  But I never met him  Because he was adopted when he was born  Oh  You know where he is though?  Yeah  Because his mother went and found him  Do you care or not?  It's not the point if I care  You know  I mean I don't  He might not even know he's adopted right 
[03:39:00]  Why am I going to go screw his life  Just so I can take a look at him  You know it's not right  Right  If he comes and finds me  I'll be only too pleased  You know  But until then  I'm not going to  Does he know his father's  Lemmy from Motorhead?  Apparently not  Or he'd probably be  Out here to find me by now  God that's got to be weird though man  There's some kid out there  That  Poor best  And his father's  Lemmy from Motorhead  He has no idea?  Well you know  He's not a kid anymore  He's 38  Right yeah  That's interesting though  It's pretty cool though  You know  It's not like  You know 
[03:39:30]  He's probably sitting there thinking  Oh he's probably the garbage man  Or something you know  Just don't want to meet him  Right  What if he's a bum or something  He might not even know he's adopted  Really?  He doesn't even know he's adopted?  I don't know  Oh  Yeah that'd be right  How'd you find out  He was a computer  His mother went and found him  But she didn't  Oh  Let on you know  Was he happy that his mom  Went to go find him?  Well she didn't let on  She was his mother  Oh she just kind of  Did a little investigating  Under a pretext  You know  Social workers  That's kind of dangerous though  Why?  Because she gets that far  She's probably going to take 
[03:40:00]  The next step  And maybe meet him  Or something like that  She didn't  As far as I know  Interesting little side note  On Lenny  That's a very interesting side note  Who knows  This guy is very interesting  We're learning a lot today  It's like college  This show today  Yeah  School of hard knocks  Right  He's got a great philosophy  This is kind of like  An Andy Kaufman bit  Cocktails with Lenny  Cocktails with Lenny  It is cocktails with Lenny  Andy Kaufman once did this thing  Where he just had breakfast  With Freddie Blassie 
[03:40:30]  The old wrestler  Oh yeah  And they just sat around  And just talked about nothing  Kind of like what we're doing  But it was  Hang out  Fascinating  Talk  Occasionally take a look  At the poker stream  The poker  Yeah well Jesus  Well I'm not looking  At the poker you are  I'm watching  How's Jesus doing  Jesus is still staring  At his chips  Just looked at his cards  I think he's deciding  Whether he should call a bet  How do you know  Where he's staring  With them shades on  He might be making a fool  See that's part of his  Enigmatic persona  It's part of trying  To have the poker face  Yeah an enigma  You can't see the eyes  Conundrum 
[03:41:00]  Right  You kind of don't know  What he's thinking  Oh he's going all in  Jesus is going all in  We probably shouldn't  Talk about this now  That's why he's called Jesus  Now he can't talk about it  Are you insane  Don't say that  Can't talk about it  Okay Jesus is not  Going all in okay  Alright  Retract that  I deny that completely  Uh oh  Don't say  Wow  Wow  Don't say wow 
[03:41:30]  People all know  They're not all stupid  Out there you know  I mean  Oh boy  Everybody on their feet  Oh boy  They're probably listening  To you with one of them  And they're on the TV  As well you know  Oh boy  He's taking his shades off too  Look he means business  Anthony is that supposed  To happen  Show no mercy  What  Oh yeah  Did you see the hands Anthony  Yes I see the hands  Alright  I see the hands  This is wow  Wow this is very  Big action  Riveting  That guy's nervous  Look at him
