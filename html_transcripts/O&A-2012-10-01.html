<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of their recently renewed contract with SiriusXM.  The hosts, using highly offensive language, detailed their frustrations with negotiations, specifically targeting a SiriusXM employee named "Bob," and speculated that the network's eagerness to re-sign them stemmed from a fear of losing them to a competitor.  They also revisited past threats to leave SiriusXM.  Their opinions on the New York Jets and Tom Brady were interjected, along with a broader discussion on the prevalence of franchises and the decline of independent businesses.  They teased upcoming segments, including their recurring monthly feature, "Jocktober," and briefly mentioned the rising internet fame of hula-hooper Katie Sunshine.

A phone call with comedian Bill Burr followed.  Calling from an airport in Jacksonville, Florida, Burr discussed his new special, his experiences with fax machines (related to contract signings), his love of sports, and his humorous takes on digital signatures and internet surveillance. He also shared an anecdote about a highly intoxicated man harassing patrons at a bar.

A large portion of the show focused on "Jocktober," which involved playing clips from other radio shows, particularly "The Bullpen" from 94.5 The Bull in Ontario, Canada, hosted by Mike Bruff ("Bruffer"), Janice McKay ("Mack"), and Kevin Fell ("K-Fell").  The hosts analyzed "The Bullpen's" comedic style and dynamic, noting K-Fell's wild antics and Mack's moderating role.  The discussion included numerous sexually explicit jokes and references to listener-generated content on their Facebook page, which often included crude jokes and sexually explicit images.  Katie Sunshine, the hula-hooping woman previously mentioned, called in for an interview, leading to further humorous and sexually suggestive exchanges.  The hosts also discussed using the joke service PrepBurger.  They detailed listener-created content targeting "The Bullpen," including photoshopped images and even a listener contest involving 94.5 The Bull's "Ultimate Guys Garage" that involved a bizarre anecdote about a man's unusual wine-opening technique.  The conversation included critiques of Jack White's abrupt concert ending,  Neil Young, and Bob Dylan's live performances.  They also discussed Kanye West's alleged sex tapes and  "The Bullpen's" use of PrepBurger.  An attempt to play "The Morning Mooch," a listener call-in game, with "The Bullpen" was hampered by poor audio quality. The hosts also noted "The Bullpen's" low Twitter following and infrequent updates,  and their Facebook page going offline due to negative posts.  A host's unintentional verbal tic, revealed by listener feedback, was also discussed.

The show included a seemingly random anecdote about a Halloween store that only opens for one night a year, owned by a character named Ted, followed by a discussion of a Fox News broadcast showing a live suicide during a car chase, focusing on their perceived hypocritical editing and subsequent apology. The hosts reacted with disbelief and mockery. They then discussed their own online activities, including their posting of the suicide video and an accidental posting of a basketball video, along with their experiences with Reddit and online comments.

A significant segment featured a studio interview with filmmaker Todd Roskin, who discussed his short film about Russ Meyer, a director of exploitation films.  The conversation included detailed, explicit descriptions of the women and their bodies depicted in Meyer's films, with clips from "Eve and the Handyman" played during the interview.  Roskin also promoted his film and mentioned his involvement with the Bob Crane biopic "Autofocus." The show concluded with the hosts' closing remarks and outro.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  I guess we signed, huh?  Did we? Oh man!  A lot of speculation. Everybody was speculating, speculating.  You guys just signed?  Oh, Jimmy, hi.  I'm not.  But there's no aggressiveness. I'm just working out one more final thing, which is very close. 
[00:00:30]  You're not allowed to be here, then.  No, it's not for the fourth, right?  You've got to leave.  Is it the fourth?  No, today.  Oh!  You're technically not allowed to be here.  Please leave.  I'm a guest.  Today's guest, everyone.  I'm a guest comic today.  You know, we want you to come in at eight.  I know.  But Travis was walking by. I said, let me just come in.  And Roland said, hey, guys. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, Jesus.  So what have we got? Two more years?  Two years of shenanigans, hijinks.  Two more years, we'll make it 20 years together.  Oh, my God.  Ten years on satellite radio.  I think that'll be perfect.  I think that'll be perfect.  That's a perfect place to leave it.  Ten years.  It'll be ten years on satellite and 20 years for the Opie and Anthony show.  Amazing.  Just couldn't leave with that weird 18 years, eight years. 
[00:01:30]  What about the people that used to say on message boards and stuff,  I don't know.  Remember that one?  Remember that like years ago after we first got to New York?  Years ago.  These guys ain't going to be around for another week.  Years ago, a month ago.  Oh, when October comes, you are fucked.  It wasn't fucked.  We were going to get what we wanted or we were going to leave.  How many times?  I guess we have to say SiriusXM thank you. 
[00:02:00]  For real.  We didn't get everything we think the show needs.  I'll say it that way.  But they came forward a bit.  I think.  They came forward a bit.  I want to try to start on the right foot.  On a positive.  I'm going to try.  Well, here's what I think happened.  I think they know that a certain company wants to come in and sweep in here and sweep out some people.  And they thought a good way to get them back was to, you know, give us a good deal. 
[00:02:30]  Do you know why you think that's what happened?  Oh, absolutely.  They want to fuck them bad and we are the dick.  This show is the upper decker in the toilet.  Yes, exactly.  That's how I totally see it.  Do you think we have perfect timing for once?  Perfect.  Oh, fuck these people then.  They can leave and go, yeah, we're gone.  But you got to deal with these assholes and what we signed them to.  Do you really believe that?  Yes.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I absolutely believe that. 
[00:03:00]  I had an inkling because stupid Bob, you know, he is just stupid.  You know, he works hard for us, but he's just dumb.  He's like, I go, what's going on, man?  You know, because we, without getting into details, we all had our things we wanted and we all were getting our things.  And I'm like, what's this about, Bob?  He goes, I think they're finally realizing that the show is really good.  I think they're starting to appreciate what you bring to the company.  I'm like, shut up. 
[00:03:30]  That's not what it is.  We are a high and hearty fuck you to the people, the incoming.  I really think they finally have realized what you guys are all about.  Really?  After all these years?  I'm like, no, Bob, something else is going on.  It's obvious.  What is it?  Thanks.  And can we exploit that?  Exploit them.  Jiminy Cricket.  Yeah.  Two more years.  Yeah.  Two more years.  And for whatever reason, thank you to SiriusXM because, you know, we needed some things and 
[00:04:00]  we got some things.  Yeah.  Some things.  But I think Anthony might be right on this because I was very suspicious.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  I'm like, no, Bob, there's something else going on.  Oh, that's exactly what it is.  You think?  Wouldn't you want to just trash the joint before you leave?  That's pretty much what it is.  Here you go.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, we did all right.  We did all right, man.  Yeah, not too shabbily.  Ha, ha.  Anyway, I don't know what else to say about it.  Yeah, it's like, hi. 
[00:04:30]  And we'll be spending our mornings with you people like we have.  Welcome.  Welcome aboard.  Anybody new?  We're Opie and Anthony.  We will be here.  It wasn't a guarantee.  How many times did you tell Bob, I'm done?  I said, I'm done like four or five times.  Did you four or five times?  And Bob goes, really?  I'm like, yeah, call him right now and say, I'm done.  Like, I'm done.  Okay.  Yeah, there were a couple of sticky points. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  A couple of sticky points.  But, yeah, Bob went in there.  I work hard for my money.  So hard for it, honey.  Oh, guys, guys.  I think they really just have realized.  Shut up.  No.  They didn't realize that we're a good show, finally.  Oh, God.  They finally realized, guys.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't believe it.  Bob really is a dumbbell.  Well, I had said something casually about doing this thing, you know. 
[00:05:30]  Because, again, they're being fine with me, too.  But it's like, the way it wound up in the contract was not what I had said.  It was like, no, Bob, that's not what I said.  It was a casual thing.  I meant to extend that.  Right.  And it's like, no, I just got to go back in and fix it.  It's a minor thing, but it's like.  It just takes so long for them to fix things.  It really is a fuck.  Can't you just jot it down and fucking send it to me?  Bob was panicking on Friday.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jimmy, I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  We're both going to be on the unemployment line.  I think.  He's got to sell my house.  I don't know what to do.  And then my fax machine in my building was out, so I go to Jimmy's building.  And Jimmy's literally behind me for 10 minutes and has no idea.  Well, I didn't have an idea either until I heard the lady go, Jimmy, can I help you?  And I turn around like, Jimmy, Jesus.  It was so good.  I was down there getting the exact same thing faxed that he was, which was signature pages.  You know, you've got to fax your signature to your agent.  It's just what you've got to do.  You're not allowed to have a fax machine in your apartment? 
[00:06:30]  I'm more than allowed.  I just don't.  Exactly.  I hate fax machines.  I'm saying, why wouldn't you?  I don't.  Oh, really?  Whenever I have one, it doesn't work.  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  What?  You need one, don't you?  No.  I used to have one until my kid, you know, used it to, I don't know.  Put a fucking cheese sandwich through?  No, he likes standing on it and jumping up and down a lot.  I lost that a while ago.  I lost that in the first year of his life.  No, I've never had a fax machine work.  I've never had good luck with a fax machine. 
[00:07:00]  You probably have shitty fax machines.  Maybe, but I don't fax enough now.  Yeah, I just figure, what the hell, I'll just go downstairs every once in a while.  Yeah.  Bob's always trying to get me to print things up.  I'm like, no, I can't do that.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's it.  Sometimes you've got to print shit up.  Yeah, he used to have a really nice printer with faxing capabilities.  Oh, that guy stopped.  It was beautiful.  Yeah, we thought it was a great idea to just keep it on the floor.  Oh, no.  Right next to the couch.  So it turned out to be his step when he was a little younger to get up on the couch.  Oh, see that.  And then we watched that for, I don't know, months and figured it was okay to allow that. 
[00:07:30]  That's a durable machine.  I fucking had to throw that away.  I don't know if I can fax for mine.  Bill Burr is on the hotline.  Hey.  It's really early, Bill.  Are you calling me to beat me up about the Jets?  Oh, hell no.  Oh, good.  No, I just called to jump in about the fax machine stuff.  Yes.  Billy.  What's up, Bill?  I am in the airport in Jacksonville, Florida, and I called in to pour myself out to let people 
[00:08:00]  know that my special is available for download on my website as of this morning.  Nice, BillBurr.com.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Bill.  I've been boring myself up, but I've had a fax machine, a Panasonic since 1999 that  Bobby Kelly told me to get the works.  He talks everyone into technology.  He is a tech guy.  He does know his shit.  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  To the point you can't even lie to him if you try to make up something cool that you have. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  To see if you can get him to freak out.  He's just like, they don't have that yet, dude.  No, they don't, dude.  They don't, dude.  He knows.  Wow.  And don't you need it, Bill?  Bill, don't you need yourself a fax machine in this business we call show?  I've got to be honest with you.  When people come to my house and they see my fax machine, they always make a comment making fun of the fact that I still have a fax machine.  People have moved. 
[00:09:00]  People always come in.  Hey, Bill, how's it going?  Hey, do you mind if I send a fax?  They always go out of their way.  I don't know.  Isn't there some new way people scan it?  Yeah, you can do that.  You could scan it.  Can't you do digital signatures, too, now?  Yeah, I gather.  But, I mean, we just type your name and that's supposedly okay now?  Yeah.  That's a little strange.  Yeah, can't you just, like, upload what your signature looks like onto the Internet so someone can steal it and start putting it on their phone?  Is that the only thing left that isn't up on the Internet if it's about yourself? 
[00:09:30]  I had to sign something recently where it was a digital signature and as you type your name, they just assume that that's how you write your G.  That's you.  And my name, you know, Greg Hughes, whatever.  It's really strange.  I'm just typing, watching the signature.  I'm like, but that's not my signature.  How is this legal?  They'll do fingerprints eventually.  You can probably put your fingerprint on something.  Future Jimmy.  Future Jimmy.  When is this happening?  Well, Bill's right.  If your signature's up there, it's going to get stolen and downloaded.  So it's either going to be your retina scan or your fingerprint, just something that is going to be, has to be unique. 
[00:10:00]  Although they can see your fingerprint, too, once that's up.  So that's, there goes that.  Retina scan they've had for a while.  I mean, Captain Kirk used it in order to find out the info for the Genesis.  Well, that's what made me think.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  The Internet is totally secure.  Yeah, of course.  We all know that.  It's all secure.  What more can we voluntarily just put up there?  Big Brother is ourselves.  We finally have done it.  Where all the information, all the pictures, videos, everyone ratting each other out. 
[00:10:30]  It's just each other.  It's turned out to be our own selves.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, Bill.  I think that deserved a little bit of applause there.  Well, I know.  I don't want to go for applause.  Well, it's nothing.  We've discovered who it is, and it is ourselves.  It is ourselves.  Thank you.  Just a little early.  Bill Burr pulling out some artillery I saw down there.  Yeah?  Some pictures of Bill Burr shooting guns.  Oh, yeah.  When in Rome.  I'm in Jacksonville, Florida.  I ate some alligator. 
[00:11:00]  I shot some guns.  And I did some shows at the Comedy Bill.  That's fantastic.  They love their guns down there.  Jacksonville is a hotbed of activity for guns.  Yeah, they had like a whole section of the store that was just silencers.  It was like cell phones on display.  Wow.  How great is that?  They had a fully automatic machine gun with a silencer on it on the wall.  Holy mackerel. 
[00:11:30]  That's amazing.  How fun is shooting?  Just a pisser.  Anthony, how many years in jail would you get if you get caught with a silencer in New  York?  Holy shit.  You're definitely going away.  Going down.  No ifs, ands, or buts about a couple of years.  Yeah, I should probably watch what I'm saying.  I'm sitting in an airport talking about 40 automatic.  Yeah, and they have silencers, too.  You don't quite fit the demo, but yeah. 
[00:12:00]  I understand.  Hey, what happened?  I mean, your pats didn't look too good in that first half, but then gave the Bills a  fucking ass kicking.  Yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  I actually went to the Jaguars game, so I got the game taped.  I haven't seen it yet.  My buddy said after a replay, you don't question whether Tom Brady went in or not, and they  actually said, you know, they confirmed that it was a touchdown.  They said they cut to his face, and he said, fuck you, bitches.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's all over the internet today.  He's on the bench, and clear as day, he said, fuck you, bitches. 
[00:12:30]  He was basically talking to the Bills fans.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm going to predict some bootleg t-shirts the next, uh, home run.  Fuck you, bitches, shirts.  Yeah, they're going to love that up there in Boston.  My fucking Jets stink.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  They're horrendous.  They're two and two officially, but they have no business even being two and two.  Yeah, here it is.  Watch here.  Fuck you, bitches.  Oh, yeah.  We just got the clip of Tom Brady. 
[00:13:00]  He does say, fuck you, bitches.  Man, the Jets lost 34-0.  Dan, I couldn't help it.  You don't have Rebus, but you guys are, uh, you guys are in rough shape, and I have no  sympathy for you.  I really don't.  I don't like the Jets or their fans.  Well, that's why I'm bringing it up.  Let you rub it in.  You start screaming Super Bowl.  You're annoying.  No, no.  I didn't rub it in.  You brought it up.  If you're going to bring it up, I'll do it.  No, I said I brought it up.  No, Bill, listen.  I said I brought it up so you can rub it in.  Oh, so I can't rub it in. 
[00:13:30]  I'm not kicking you when you're down.  I don't give a fuck.  This team stinks.  And then people on Twitter, oh, but fucking relax.  They don't stink.  They stink.  Sanchez is a horrible quarterback.  He has a good game every, like, four games.  Opie, it's Sanchise.  Remember?  Sanchise, yeah.  He was called that for a while.  New York is the king of giving somebody an epic nickname after two good games.  I want to hate Bill for that, but he's right.  Epic nickname. 
[00:14:00]  You mean like, you mean like Linsanity?  Yeah, Linsanity.  Linsanity, Mancinius.  Yeah.  John Villa.  Anybody.  You do anything in New York, it's just so gigantic that you get this unbelievable nickname.  And they, you know, they were getting their asses kicked and they still didn't put Tebow in yesterday.  I don't know what that's about.  You would think they would want to, like, get him some playing time just for whatever reason, you know?  But they sat him.  And the beauty of Tebow, it's 34-0 and this game is over. 
[00:14:30]  He's still on the sideline with his helmet on, like, no, man, I'm ready to go in.  Put me in, coach.  He's got that attitude.  I like him.  Oh, there you go.  He's a go-getter.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think the guy's a winner, but I just don't know how he fits in in the NFL.  You ever see the guy throw?  I mean, it's horrific.  It really is.  He's got happy feet.  I mean, you're going to put him in and run the wishbone?  Like, how long before the NFL coaches figure out how to stop that? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  You're absolutely right.  The guy cannot throw at all.  Yeah.  But then again, can Sanchez at this point?  What's that?  I said, then again, can Sanchez at this point?  I don't know, but if you put Tim Tebow in as the coach, you should be wearing like a floor-length raccoon coat.  We're going to run to the right, see?  And then we're going to run to the left.  Nah, whatever.  No, razzle-dazzle play.  The forward pass?  You're insane. 
[00:15:30]  I've got to find a second team already.  Jimmy, I had a great time.  I don't know if you ever played the Comedy Zone down here.  I want to underrate a club, man.  It's awesome.  I don't think I ever...  I've been to Jacksonville once.  I don't know if it was for that or for something else.  I think I had a six-hour layover there from when I went to Cuba with Jeff Ross.  I think that's my entire Jacksonville, Florida history.  Horrible.  Did you get out of the airport?  No, I mean, we were just going from the military for us in there, I think.  But no, I would like to do that.  The Comedy Zones are pretty good.  Yeah, no, it's a fun room, and, you know, I wouldn't stay there. 
[00:16:00]  I would definitely get the hotel down the street.  Oh, wait, do they have a condo there?  Yeah, it's at a Ramada.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, the Comedy Zones are not always in the most prestigious buildings.  I've noticed that, too.  Where's the one in Harrisburg?  There's a Comedy Zone, which is a great room, but it's in a very weird little motel, hotel area.  You always stay down the street.  The club is great.  The club is great, but it's inside of a Ramada that has not been remodeled since the Everly Brothers' first floor. 
[00:16:30]  Are you saying the accommodations are not up to snuff?  Yeah, but the room is great, and the crowds were phenomenal.  Very cool.  I would love to do that, because I kind of like work in Florida, and I do pretty well down there, except in Miami.  I didn't draw up for shit.  I have only done it once.  I don't think I'll ever go back.  I heard your name about 50 times this weekend.  They were all, oh, Opie and Anthony Tan, when's Jimmy coming down, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:17:00]  I heard that like 50 times this weekend.  Oh, good, man.  Good, good.  I'll definitely get down there, then.  I need another market I can go in and half sell.  It'd be nice.  I need to listen to my Twitterers again and then realize that, wow, there's only 10 people asking me to come, and I bought it hook, line, and sinker.  I'm just so eager for love.  Jimmy, when are you coming?  You've got to book me there, Pete.  It says there's an onslaught of requests.  He has 10 people.  Ouch.  Ouch. 
[00:17:30]  Jimmy, when you come into Davenport, do you jump on those tweets?  Yeah.  No, I just kind of ignore them, because I know they mean well.  And so how many times should you write never?  I feel bad.  And if I get enough of them, I'll go.  Like, Oklahoma, I want to go to, because I've gotten thousands of emails since we've been on satellite from Oklahoma.  So that's my next goal to a place I've ever been.  Let's go there.  I would love to do a gig in Oklahoma.  Let's go there, man.  Have you been?  Have I been to Oklahoma?  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  I passed through one time.  Went to a Thunder game there.  Oh, okay.  That was it.  I've never performed there, though.  How was that?  How was that going to a Thunder game?  How were the fans down there?  Oh, it was like a college atmosphere.  Yeah, that's right here.  It's like a bare-bones, like, stadium.  They don't really have any luxury boxes.  It's all made out of concrete, so it gets loud as hell in there.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  You know, they're just beyond excited that all of a sudden, like, they're in the league.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, right on.  Right on.  We should speak. 
[00:18:30]  Dude, I've got to send you some of the pictures of some of the fans at the Jaguars game.  I wasn't too, you know, I wasn't too nice the way I was taking pictures.  Dude, it was like 90% humidity with some of the fattest people I've ever seen.  Oh, God damn.  Where are those pictures going to be?  I actually gave them to my guy who does my podcast.  I think he, hopefully he put them up.  I texted to him late at night.  There was some, there was one, there was two guys, like, they were in the front row leaning on the railing. 
[00:19:00]  They literally look like rhinos from behind.  Okay, Bill.  Bill rules.  Dude, do you, do you book a, like, will you book a show that night or will you go in a day early for a place like that?  Just to go to the show, to go to the game?  Oh, I actually hung around for an extra day.  Oh, you do?  Okay, so you can actually go and enjoy the game.  But you said in the past you book gigs depending on sporting events at times, right, Bill?  That's how I've been doing the road.  That was the 110th franchise I've seen a home game of, a professional one. 
[00:19:30]  So I'm running out of teams.  I've only got, like, 10, 15 left I've got to see.  Have you done every baseball ballpark?  Yep.  You have?  All of those.  Yep.  Wow.  I've seen all of those.  Wow.  I've seen every football team but about four, every hockey team but about three, and I need, like, seven basketball.  And then I'll be alone with my thoughts, Anthony, and that's when it gets scary.  Yeah, then it gets scary when you don't have any more distractions.  Why don't you start the college circuit? 
[00:20:00]  He does college, too.  He does college sports.  I'm going to LSU, Alabama later on this year.  Oh, so you'll book, like, you'll book close and do the gig, and you'll actually just travel to a city that's really close by just to go to the stadium?  Yeah, as opposed to just sitting there in the comedy condo, you know, ordering from Steak and Shake and wanting to kill myself.  Right, right.  I was like, all right, well, you know, Oklahoma, I saw the Miami Heat game where Chris Bosh and, what's the state, almost got into a fight.  I've seen some decent stuff.  Some of them have been more pathetic. 
[00:20:30]  Going to a Golden State Warriors game by myself might have been a low point.  But you know what?  That's not – I've done the same thing for escorts but not nearly as much.  I've literally played but four or five gigs because it was escorts I wanted to see in that city.  And your fans are in the audience thinking, oh, he came to see us.  No.  Yeah, they have no idea.  You can thank Craigslist or fucking Erosky.  They have no idea.  They have a really good escort in that town.  But I've never done what Bill did, which is – I think that's a great thing, man.  It just gives you a reason to kind of go to a place you wouldn't go before. 
[00:21:00]  But I got to do something when I'm there because I can't do the road anymore as far as like, you know, going to the local mall or something like that.  Like, honestly, like the suicidal thoughts become like overwhelming.  So, yeah, I'll go to Jacksonville.  I'll go to a gun range.  Jesus.  I'll eat some alligator.  I'll go see a game.  I mean, I have to do something.  I'm basically – I should probably be filming this.  It's probably just some – it's a great travel channel show.  It's just some lonely loser out there.  Jesus. 
[00:21:30]  And then like promoting everything.  I'll be just talking about how fat everybody is and how the food sucks.  What time do you get up in the morning when you're – when I'm on the road, man, I go to bed at like 4 or 5 unless I press the next morning and get up at, you know, 4 in the afternoon for gigs if I can.  No, actually, I've been staying out late.  We were staying out late last night with these fucking scumbags at the bar downstairs, and this guy was hilarious, man.  This guy just turned 40 years old.  He broke his arm falling out of a tree. 
[00:22:00]  He somehow like – he's like the married father of three, and he's a complete drunk.  And he had this thing.  Anytime anybody walked up to him and told him, like, he'd just go, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, as they were talking to him.  He said it to the manager when the manager told him to – you know, that he was cursing too much.  And then right – he had this gift that right as he was about ready to get kicked out, he goes, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  And he just kept getting out of it.  At the end of the – it was hilarious, dude. 
[00:22:30]  At the end of the night, it looks like this Korean War veteran comes walking by to say goodnight, you know, old greatest generation, you know, class guy is going to say goodnight to everybody wearing this Jaguars jersey.  He goes – he's like, goodnight, fellas.  And he just goes, fuck you.  Fuck you.  And he just starts saying that to him.  The old guy snapped.  He's like, let me tell you something.  You better make sure you know who you're saying that to, you know, because then the next time, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then he just looked at all of us, and he goes, lesson over. 
[00:23:00]  But at that point, we actually told the guy to go to bed because it was embarrassing, man.  He was cursing out an old man.  Jeez.  Yeah, Berzy, yeah, my buddy I tore with, he said, no, fuck you, go to bed.  And the guy looked at me.  I said, yeah, beat it.  Your night's over.  Beat it.  What an asshole.  Yeah, he was.  He was an asshole.  But I got to tell you, when he was – he said, fuck you, to the manager six times and then said, no, no, I'm just kidding, and got out of it.  I actually had to admire him.  No, no, I'm just kidding.  Yeah, that works. 
[00:23:30]  I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.  Where are you off to, Bill?  I go to L.A., and then I'm at Go Bananas out in Cincinnati next year.  I got like a – I have seven weekends in a row.  It's a long story how this happens.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  The last one is in Australia.  That's awesome.  That's cool.  But that's the end of my year, though, basically.  Then the rest of the stuff I have is kind of close by, and yeah.  How long are you doing in Australia?  I've heard those are great fucking gigs. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, I'm doing like I think three nights out there, and I'm just doing a show at like the Sydney Comedy Zone, whatever they have.  Right, right.  And then I'm doing one night at the festival.  It's not one of those just the last things, so I'd be on one of the gallons or something like that.  So tickets are doing all right, though, man.  I was actually happy.  Like we've come in close to selling a couple.  It's like a little 300, 400 seater.  But, you know, other side of the world, different hemisphere. 
[00:24:30]  I'm pretty excited.  Yeah, it's supposed to be a really good market for American comics.  And everybody says, you know, that they actually get this radio show there.  So, like, people listen to it online, I guess.  Yeah, I don't know.  But Australia is supposed to be a good market.  So it's a smart thing to do.  You're going to go for like four or five days, though.  Well, I'm going to stick around a little longer.  I'm going to go snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef.  I'm going to drown out the suicidal thoughts before the shark hits me.  Jesus.  You depressed, Bill? 
[00:25:00]  Are you in a depression?  Are you just kidding?  No, no, no.  If I just do the road every other week, I'm in a good mood.  But if I do it seven weeks in a row, I really start examining what exactly I signed up for.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's on the stage.  Damn it.  Well, what I was talking about the last time I was on your show is what I can't stand is, like, how much money do you have to make where you can just stop for a while?  Where you can just sit still?  The second you stop working, it just starts, everything just hits you. 
[00:25:30]  All of a sudden, you need a new roof.  Something happens, right?  A new roof, yeah.  Car shits the bed.  Taxes come in.  I'm getting killed.  I'm getting killed in taxes.  Yeah, I just got a fucking, I just got a hammer to the teeth with what I have to pay.  Not to bring it up politically, but enjoy January 1st when everybody's taxes even go up further.  Yeah.  Punch your banker in the face today, everybody.  You guys both, yeah, you look at that differently than you.  You certainly did. 
[00:26:00]  That's the tab we're paying.  Those guys chewed and screwed on all of it.  Bastards.  So, Anthony, are you still holding on to that, that it's one of the political parties?  Uh-oh.  Oh, Bill, I'd be crazy to even think that.  Here we go.  That a signature could keep the fucking taxes from going up January 1st, though.  You know, that's kind of crazy for me to even think.  You just buy it, hook, line, and sink it, don't you?  You look at the talking head, the fall guy, the guy they signed up. 
[00:26:30]  The fall guy, is that who it is?  Yeah.  I love you, Bill.  Anthony, do you honestly think that your vote, like, when they're talking on television,  that they're actually talking to you?  Do you really believe that?  No.  Do you care about Anthony?  No.  I just don't want to pay such high taxes.  These goddamn liberal conservatives.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Bill knows it all.  I forgot.  Right-wing tree-hugger. 
[00:27:00]  Ah, Jesus Christ.  Hate them all, right, Bill?  Hate them all.  This is how I look at it.  Yeah.  If I contribute $100 to a campaign, that really pales into comparison to the $50 million that  any corporation can put in.  Right.  So, at the end of the day, they can actually, there's people who donate so much money, they  can call the White House the way you call one of your buddies.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't see that as being a good thing. 
[00:27:30]  No.  Yeah.  No.  Those are the guys.  Those are the guys who are calling the shots.  I just don't want to pay as much taxes as I do.  It's crazy.  And I certainly don't want them going up.  Someone's going to have to pay for it.  We're fighting two wars.  The housing market collapsed.  Those rich guys aren't going to pay for it.  We're still fighting two wars.  We're still fighting two wars.  What happened?  One of them.  I think one's over.  One and a third.  One and a third.  One point three.  But we lost our 2,000th guy.  Yeah, but we're still over there.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Fuck.  We've still got all our stuff over there.  We've still got our stuff laying all over from World War II.  Still.  We've still got our stuff.  Yeah.  In Germany.  It was already...  Europe.  That'd be cool to just walk around and check that shit out.  Where is that shit?  Just everywhere?  Yeah.  Our shit.  All our shit.  Is it just everywhere?  Here and there?  Well, that.  But I was a bit more talking our financial shit.  Yeah.  And our troops are still in Europe because of what happened after World War II.  It's crazy. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  You couldn't let Germany go back to their little ideologies again.  That was a two-strikes-and-you're-out.  Yeah.  If we leave, we know we're coming back.  We kind of let Japan on their own.  And, you know, we'll see how you do.  But Germany, yeah, they've proven they can't be left alone to their own devices.  Yeah.  Billy.  It's just petering out.  I'm feeling petering right now. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  I'm feeling out.  I'm petering.  Well, Bill, we're going to go to BillBurr.com.  We're going to download your special, right?  I hope so.  And if people don't buy this thing, I'm going to shoot my next one on an iPhone.  You might as well.  Not a bad idea.  Hasn't been done yet.  I saw Bill at Caroline's.  Amazing, right?  Holy fuck, is he funny.  God damn.  Just fucking.  I got angry when my peripheral vision saw that red light that tells you, you know, get the fuck off the stage light. 
[00:29:30]  I was like, ah, God damn it.  I'm fucking having a good time here.  We had a good time, man.  We hung till like four in the morning, I believe.  Oh, my God.  How long ago did you shoot the special?  I staggered home after that night.  Wow, really?  Yes.  Me and Bill just on the street corner.  I don't even know where we were.  Somewhere on 8th Avenue.  Just yapping as these degenerates are walking past us.  Bill finally goes after like a half an hour.  I was like, ah, maybe we ought to go before we get our head caved in.  You know what those guys said as they were walking by? 
[00:30:00]  Look at these degenerates.  Look at these drunks.  Exactly.  Who are you kidding?  As you guys are pontificating, I'm sure.  Oh, we were holding court.  Holding court.  I think you were part of the problem.  Yeah, we were holding court on 8th Avenue.  Yeah.  Great.  Well, I'm about ready to go board my plane, and I'm going to step into the aisle so we can help expedite the loading process.  Yes.  Very good, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  You're a good man.  That's the only place you ever hear that word.  I'm convinced it's a word they made up to try and sound official. 
[00:30:30]  Bill, don't dwell on your thoughts too much.  Keep distracted, and we'll see you when you come back.  You know what sucks is you can't get a direct flight back from L.A. to Jacksonville, so now I have to go fly to Dallas, get off a perfectly good plane, and roll the dice.  The next one's going to work, too.  God, I hate connecting flights.  It's the worst.  Oh, that is terrible.  There's no reason you're all the way up there, and you've got to come all the way back down just to go all the way back up again. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, it's the worst.  It's annoying.  What about when they go way past your destination, and then you have to take the plane backwards?  Like when you went from the East Coast to L.A. back to Vegas.  Yeah, the time that XM at the time fucked me and didn't have a ticket for my wife, so I had to wait, and then we had to fly to L.A. to get to Vegas.  All the way to L.A., wait two hours to go backwards.  How fun is that?  I remember having to go from New York to Salt Lake City to Boulder, Colorado in a death plane over the Rocky Mountains. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, that was some of the scariest shit ever.  That made you nervous?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Totally.  You guys remember that story with those pilots who were just up front shooting the breeze, and they were supposed to land in Chicago, and by the time they realized that they had already gone past it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They had to turn around.  Hey, come on.  You missed an exit talking to your buddies, you know. 
[00:32:00]  Is that the one on the Northwest flight when they fell asleep?  Oh, I don't know.  That might have been an L.A. flight.  It was a night flight, and they dozed off, and they overshot, and they were over the ocean.  Yeah, I remember that one, too.  It was a Northwest flight.  And the voice recorder, you could tell that they had just woken up.  Yeah.  Oh, that's bad.  That's not good.  The machine is just driving.  It's just flying people.  Ah, the machine will do it.  It's frightening.  That's like one of those sci-fi movies.  You know, the robot wakes you up, and you're on the other side of space. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, listen, I'm getting on the plane.  I've got to jump off the phone.  Thanks.  All right, Bill.  Take it in, man.  Thanks, Bill.  Have a good flight, or two flights.  Bill.  Yeah.  Bill's hilarious.  I love when the guys check in early morning.  Yeah.  After their long weekend, wherever the fuck they're doing their comedy.  We had such a blast, man.  We were just fucking hammered.  Yeah.  I didn't even know what we were drinking at one point.  I do remember the taste of Jägermeister at some point.  Oh, fuck.  But Bill and, like, I guess, DeRosa, they like drinking whiskey. 
[00:33:00]  Really?  Yeah.  They'll just drink, like, whiskey.  Just a warm whiskey in a glass.  It's like, ah, it doesn't sound good.  Does Bill drink?  I haven't hung out with Bill in a while, like, in a social setting.  I didn't think he drank at all, actually.  Oh, God.  No, Bill will drink.  Bill will throw him back.  Okay.  Not as often as a lot of people I know.  Like Joe DeRosa?  And me and DeRosa.  Joe's a drunk, right?  Joe is a drunk.  He's a real sot. 
[00:33:30]  I love a sot.  When you go out with Joe, you know you're drinking.  He's one of those guys that will just, after a few, he starts pressuring you to get as drunk as he is.  So he's just lining up shots of everything.  Yeah, come on, come on.  Go, get up here.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Here it goes.  That whiskey, though, is rough.  Oh.  You ever do whiskey?  I can't.  You used to do the whiskey sour.  Whiskey sour?  In college.  I'll have a whiskey sour. 
[00:34:00]  No, I like...  But straight-up whiskey, fuck no.  Mixer, you know?  I can't drink straight whiskey.  There doesn't seem to be any reason for it.  The only one I could do is...  I could do a martini every once in a while.  Yeah.  Not some of the...  I could do just a straight-up martini once in a while.  Like a vodka martini, something like that.  I like a little flavoring in the martinis, but I could do one straight up.  I like that.  But besides that, I can't do hard liquor, man.  No.  Not really.  No, no, no.  Not straight up.  Contrary to popular belief, aside from shots of Jaeger every so often, I'm not a hard liquor kind 
[00:34:30]  of guy.  No more just beer and wine.  And a little Jack and Coke.  Well, if I'm going to be drinking booze, it's mixed drink like a Jack and Coke, Captain  and Coke, vodka OJ, vodka OJ, cranberry, vodka OJ, cranberry, pineapple.  Do you do the sea breeze?  I love a good sea breeze.  Can I have a sea breeze, please?  Yeah.  What's in a sea breeze?  It's a sea breeze.  Cranberry.  Yeah.  Vodka and grapefruit, right?  Is that grapefruit or pineapple?  I don't know one of those.  I don't believe it's grapefruit.  I know any of those things are pretty goddamn good. 
[00:35:00]  I was a bartender for a while.  I should know my drinks.  Oh, damn.  It's the only other job I had.  But I definitely like a good vodka, juicy drink.  You know how lame my jobs have been over the years?  Caddy.  Caddy.  Worked in a video store.  Oh.  And bartending.  The video store.  Were you the counter guy?  Yeah.  I told the story.  It was in Geneseo.  This is late.  Well, no.  You weren't kind. 
[00:35:30]  You did not rewind.  I'm going to fucking, I'm going to really fucking put an age on myself.  But I worked at a video store when they were really important.  And it was in Geneseo.  And I was desperate for money.  And my whole fraternity would come in and just take movies.  Oh.  The mom and pop stuff.  Yeah.  But I got fired because they would just take the movies.  I'm like, dude, you got to bring some of these movies back.  Oh, and they wouldn't bring them back.  And then we had, I think, if memory serves me right, two or three VCRs you could rent out.  And no one had VCRs yet. 
[00:36:00]  So, of course, we had a couple of those at the fraternity house.  No one could really rent the VCRs out.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, did I get fired.  You were definitely not.  Oh, boy, did I.  And I told the story.  They would come in.  You got to remember, no smartphones, nothing.  Yeah.  So, like, it was slow.  The fraternity guys would come in to see me because it was on Main Street up there in Geneseo.  And we would watch porn in the actual store.  Oh, that's great.  And then sometimes it took, you know, I couldn't get my button on the stop fast enough when  the moms were coming in with the kids and whatnot. 
[00:36:30]  It was a fucking mess.  I don't think I lasted more than three months there.  Was that pre-blockbuster?  Yeah, man.  This goes way the fuck back.  Video stores just popped up and they were mom and pop shops all over the place.  It was a good little family business.  Yeah.  Small little business.  You'd go in there.  You'd have to sign up.  You'd have to usually pay a fee when you first went in, like, in order to join.  Like, $100 or something.  And then you needed a credit card.  And then I remember the horror if you lost a movie because it was over $100 to replace 
[00:37:00]  one VHS tape.  Fuck yeah.  They were like, oh, well, I see we don't have, well, I'm trying to think of a good movie.  Top Gun?  Right.  Oh, you didn't bring back Top Gun.  That's $120.  What?  I hate franchises.  Always have.  And, you know, going back to, like, the little video stores.  You remember, every town had this little family business.  It was nice.  And then slowly but surely.  Blockbuster just saw. 
[00:37:30]  Just fucking taking over everything.  They saw what was happening.  Do you remember growing up, we did a lot of work around our house, so we always had to  go to the lumber guy?  Yeah.  The local lumber guy?  Yeah, yeah.  The lumber store.  There's, like, two of those guys left in the whole country.  Yeah, now you just got the big home depot.  My dad would go, like, hey, we gotta get some two-by-fours, so we would jump in the car  and go, I forgot the name of the place, but whatever.  And we'd go over there, and it was like a social thing.  Hey, Ed, how's it going?  Well, I need some two-by-fours today.  All right, pull the truck around the back, and Jack's back there. 
[00:38:00]  He'll help you out.  All right, thanks, Ed.  Need some nails, too?  Yeah, I guess I'll take some nails.  It was just this, like, give and take.  Yeah.  And then fucking Home Depot.  We're fucking taking over all this shit, too.  There's something to be said, though, for being able to get what you're looking for.  I guess.  Because the video stores, I remember going in trying to, you know, you're going in going,  ah, I'm going to get Lethal Weapon, and you walk out with fucking, you know, Ernest Goes  to Jail or some shit.  That's why you had to join a couple different video stores.  Oh, was that it?  We joined a few in the neighborhood.  It's a hundred bucks a clip.  I don't know what it was. 
[00:38:30]  I think it was sort of affordable.  But Blockbuster would have 75 of whatever new releases.  Yeah, new release.  A mom-and-pop store.  It's like, sorry, it's still out.  I know, but you can't.  It's like this, though.  I'm putting my hands up in the air.  I know.  It's kind of the...  You're right.  Because then when Blockbuster did hit, you're right.  You'd never...  You knew the movie would be there.  Dude, they ruled.  They had popcorn, candy.  They were fucking pretty good, except for their rated X, their lack of X films.  But they had...  Yeah.  Yeah, that was like...  Boy, the heyday of renting fucking movies, man. 
[00:39:00]  Remember that?  Blockbuster, just huge.  It became an event.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Let's go find a movie.  Let's go to Blockbuster.  Find a movie.  I was Mr. Latefee.  Oh, boy, did I never fucking bring the videos back on time.  Ever.  And then you reach a point.  It was almost the same feeling I got when I used to cut class, and I would cut for so  long that I couldn't even go near the building anymore, near the side of the building where  the class was, because you were embarrassed, because you didn't want to run into the teacher. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  That's how I felt about the video store.  I'm like, I can't go back now.  I owe so much in late fees.  Right.  It's embarrassing to walk up there.  Yeah.  And they would call you.  Oh, you're going to bring the movie back?  Oh, what are you doing?  No one has been able to rent that movie in two weeks because you have it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  It would be some fucking really current movie that everybody wanted.  But meanwhile, Netflix, it's like, you know, you have fucking nine movies for a year.  It's like, would you like some more?  Yeah.  Well, no, I have other.  Are you sure?  But I'd be happy to send you some more.  I don't know how that business works.  They just want to get rid of their fucking DVDs. 
[00:40:00]  I haven't returned a Netflix movie in five years, I think.  And they've never complained or asked for it back.  Yeah.  I still have that new release, Gladiator.  Right.  The mom and pop thing, though.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I hate that that went away.  I hate that you go to a city or a town and it's all the same shit.  I remember growing up, it was so cool.  When you went to another town, they had their own shit to check out.  Their own hamburger joint.  Their own video store.  It was cool.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Their own movie theater that was a little different.  Now it's all the same.  Why would you even travel?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm kind of that guy.  What?  You like franchises.  I hate fucking mom and pop outfits.  I love it the other way around.  Oh, God.  Really?  Yeah.  Some motherfucker in there trying to sell you something that you don't need because he doesn't  have what you need.  So you'd rather just go to chain stores?  Well, this fashioner will work.  No, no.  I need a certain screw that gets... 
[00:41:00]  This one is good, too.  No.  I kind of like that.  I want to miss that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Although I was in Home Depot recently and wow.  Wow.  What do they got?  Like 200 employees?  Yeah.  What's that about?  They want to make sure that you can find someone, huh?  Well, it's usually a pain in the ass, though, to still find people.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'll call.  Oh, I'll call.  And then they get on the little speaker.  Oh, you're a service person in hardware?  And then you're sitting there going, and no one's running for that one. 
[00:41:30]  Home Depot is just overwhelming for a guy like me.  Oh, you run around.  The Oopster's not good with his hands.  The Oopster likes pre-assembled.  Oh, boy, does he.  You should get my wife on the phone.  I yell and scream putting this shit together.  And it's easy shit to put together.  Yeah.  They have made it easy, but...  A lot of those little fasteners that go in that little round hole, and then you turn it  with a Phillips head screwdriver.  I yell and scream, half my stuff is already damaged because I threw it against a wall. 
[00:42:00]  Like, a nice finish now has a scrape in it.  That's got to be a treat.  It's so frustrating.  Oh, God.  It's so frustrating.  And you don't need any tools, really.  They give you everything in the box, but...  Yeah, yeah.  The worst is when shit's missing.  That, to me, I can't deal with it.  When something in the box is fucking missing.  That's rare, though.  It's rare, but it seems to always happen to me.  Because there's nothing you can do about it. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  Fuck, I need this belt.  They finally figured out the hard plastic, though, I noticed.  Although, last night I had to get a new electric toothbrush, and I was opening that shit up.  I was convinced I was going to literally, literally, I'm going to say literally, slice a finger off.  Oh, it's...  Because I was too lazy to get some kind of scissors.  That's what it is.  You need to start trying to pull that shit apart, and you're risking severely cutting your hand.  It's razor sharp, and then that crimped edge thing they do? 
[00:43:00]  Right.  If you pull that off, it becomes a dagger.  Right.  And then if your hand slips, you're in deep shit.  You're done, Ski.  But for the most part, I don't see that anymore.  Yeah.  For the most part, it pulls apart nicely.  Yeah, they kind of figured it out.  I guess the lawsuits were getting a little high.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, right.  I remember that shit.  Guy who started Blockbuster, used to own every Florida sports team.  All right.  Okay, well, good for him.  Used mom's car to rent Showgirls, NC-17 version.  Good for you.  Has a hack you need to screw, but they sell three-packed line. 
[00:43:30]  Go for it.  Tony!  Hey!  What do you got, buddy?  This Home Depot crap, you're so right, man.  You go there and you try to buy it.  You need two screws?  Yeah.  You can't buy two.  They come in a pack of three.  You want to buy four screws?  You always need four screws.  You can't buy four.  Thank you.  Food's here.  Ah.  All right. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  We got lots to do today.  We got to talk about the fucking Fox News suicide thing.  Oh, yeah.  That was unbelievable.  Yes.  Also, I guess we did football already.  If the Jets sucked, then I don't feel like talking about football, and these guys don't  really watch, so.  Giants lost to the Eagles last night, 1917.  Damn.  Yeah, I realize.  I heard that was a missed field goal to win it for the Giants, right?  Is that what happened over there?  Oh, did they miss a field goal?  I believe so.  I remember that going on.  They marched down the field.  They had a chance to win, and they missed. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  I believe that's how that ended.  I don't know much about football when, and I tweeted this, that I can't figure out if  people are being sarcastic about somebody's prowess on the field.  Like when they go, oh, yeah, this guy's great.  And it's like, oh, does this suck?  That's severe sarcasm.  Yeah, yeah.  When you read the name, and it's like, you have no clue?  Yeah.  You don't know anything about it.  Go ahead.  Can you say you respond to that?  Well, you know, whatever.  The guy's great.  Yeah.  You know, like, that's kind of like, you know, you understand what they're saying, 
[00:45:00]  but, you know, what are you going to do?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, this guy.  Oh, boy, he sure can fucking catch.  Oh, can he?  And Arnold was on 60 Minutes.  Some good shit there, too.  He's got the new book coming out called Total Recall.  His wife's pissed.  It's his memoirs.  Why is his wife pissed?  Because they didn't ask her to comment until the very end, and they would not let her see  the piece or tell her what Arnold had said.  Nice.  So she's like, I'm not giving a generalized statement just for the piece.  And I hold in my hand. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, also, we got Katie Sunshine calling in.  She has become huge in the last few days.  Oh, man.  That's Hula Hoop Girl.  Yeah.  With everyone else trying to turn us on to a better Hula Hoop Girl.  Stop it.  Guess what?  You're losing.  Stop it.  She's the real deal, man.  She's going to call the show at 730.  Nice.  So we'll talk to her about her newfound fame.  Although she's been relatively famous, I guess.  Yeah, internet fame.  But now she's really blown up.  And I'm holding my hand. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, boy.  The first Rocktober.  Rocktober.  You know, there's people around here that aren't fans of Rocktober.  Rocktober.  I mean...  Jocktober.  Oh, I said Rocktober.  Jocktober.  Jocktober, of course.  Yeah, I know there's people.  Jocktober.  I know there's people who aren't fans.  I don't give a shit.  No.  I don't really get the Jocktober thing.  We're not talking about listeners, by the way.  No, no.  People that should be in the know.  I'm starting off on the right foot, I promise. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, boy.  But it has to be said that it has been said in the past that...  I don't really...  I don't know.  Maybe...  I don't get it.  Maybe do it for a couple minutes every other day or so.  No.  But how you guys...  I don't...  I'm really...  Eating up a lot of time.  I don't really...  Do you realize how I fucking love this?  One twelfth of a year is fabulous.  I wait all year for this.  Yes.  I've been getting tweets for a month.  Yes.  From people saying, you know, 29 days.  It's going to be Jocktober.  Jocktober. 
[00:47:00]  And we have the first one.  Jocktober, of course, for the people that are new to this show.  And it seems like we're getting new people all the time.  It's a little strange.  We just beat the shit out of the entire radio industry for a month straight.  Yeah.  And today we're going to go to Canada to start it all off.  First time ever.  First time ever?  I think so.  We've never featured a show from Canada.  Not that I recall.  And this does go hand in hand with Rocktober because that's the whole thing.  When October rolls around, radio guys love calling it Rocktober. 
[00:47:30]  October, Rocktober.  Get it?  And the Jocktober thing just kind of carries over, making fun of anybody that would say Rocktober.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Is this a good show to start it off?  You've got to start off strong there, son.  Oh, yeah.  Open big, close big.  I thought this show was a good show.  I was surprised Canada's got a lot to offer in terms of...  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Can you promise me we don't feature any fucking shows with guys I know personally?  No, I cannot promise that.  That I used to do radio with?  You know what I can promise you?  You know, I've tried to strike up a friendship with that guy ever since, and he doesn't want 
[00:48:00]  anything to do with me.  What have you texted him a couple times?  We used to room together.  We started in radio together.  We went to war together.  We played golf together.  And I swear, and this is the God's honest truth, Sam brought this show from Nashville  last year, and I really was thinking in the back of my head, you know what?  The show isn't that bad.  It's just not what we do.  I really was thinking that, and I'm not trying to spin it, but then I felt like I was in the  spirit of it, so I was all in like everybody else.  But then something didn't seem right. 
[00:48:30]  Long story short, it turns out to be a guy that I started radio with in Geneseo.  Yep.  Where we stayed one summer just to run the radio station together, and then we ended up  rooming together, and then we lost touch over the years, and it's that guy.  That was my favorite moment of last year's Jocktober, because it was like, he had just  been bashing him, and we were halfway through the segment, and there was some reference to  his last name on the clip.  And I tapped out.  I knew.  And you go, wait a minute.  Fuck.  But the whole time, I'm like, that voice.  Something about that voice.  And then you realize that you're in the situation where this guy that you start, like you both 
[00:49:00]  had the same dream.  Started with.  18 years old.  19 years old.  And you're both like, yeah, we're going to do it.  Yeah.  And he's stuck in some small market.  He's in Nashville.  He's doing good.  You're a national radio star.  Making fun of him.  And randomly, one day, you just decide to start making fun of him for no reason.  But then I'm like, I'm trying to make good.  I follow him on Twitter.  I comment about his tweets.  And he will not follow me.  Does he remark when you comment? 
[00:49:30]  No, man.  He doesn't want anything to do with me.  Trying to rebuild that bridge.  Horrible.  We started together.  We just lost touch over the years.  You know what's great about Jacktober?  Yes.  The listener participation with their various websites and Facebook pages.  It's just so much fun to get the listener involved.  Oh, boy.  It really did become a multidimensional thing last year.  Yes, it did.  As the listeners became involved and going to Facebook pages. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, boy.  You know what's really fun is that you guys get to stay in New York and Dummy has to go  on the road and hear, they won't take you.  They were featured on Jack Tolbert.  How many times?  Oh, God.  Whoops.  Whoopsie.  I also like that we still say featured on Jacktober.  Featured.  As if it's an honor to be featured.  It is an honor.  Did you hear I was featured on Jacktober?  Yeah.  I was a featured guest.  Featured.  You know that, I think her name is Terry Clifford in Rochester? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  I remember her.  Weese gives me Terry Clifford stories all the time.  Oh, no.  Because it's a small town and he runs into her.  Of course she's 600 pounds.  And he tries to tell me, look, she's really, I'm like, I don't care if they're nice people  off the air.  We had a, you know, we featured her.  She should be proud.  E-Rock would have to double check on the date, but this is either the fourth or the fifth  year of Jacktober.  Yeah.  And we have featured Terry Clifford every year. 
[00:51:00]  I've insisted.  Is there a strong possibility we feature her again?  I don't like to give any spoilers.  See, in a weird way, it's hard to feature new shows because these are now characters,  these people.  Of course.  And you've got to see what they've been up to in the past year.  Of course.  Have they changed their ways?  Right.  And generally speaking, they have not.  They never do.  All right.  With that said, when we get back, we're going to start Jacktober with a fine little radio  show out of Canada.  We can't announce what station yet. 
[00:51:30]  I know.  No heads up.  I know.  None.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm very excited.  Do they have a hole?  There's a female on the show.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  And I will promise you this.  You guys all say that you forget how exhausted you are with the Jacktober segments.  Like, you're all excited when they start.  Yes.  And then within a couple days, you forget how angry and exhausted and furious.  Yes. 
[00:52:00]  My prediction is, exhaustion sets in on day one of Jacktober.  What?  Yes.  You will be tired of this segment today.  All right.  Great.  So, there you go.  For the people just waking up, your headline is, yes, we did re-sign with SiriusXM for  a couple more years.  And after the break, we start Jacktober.  Wow.  Stay there.  It's Jacktober.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of DraftKraftKast radio from around this great nation of ours. 
[00:52:30]  Great.  Thank you.  So, turn up this turntacular radio.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Yes.  It's Jacktober.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is it really?  Oh, boy.  Is it really Jacktober?  Oh, boy.  This has all the features.  Is this really Jacktober?  It's Jacktober.  Oh, God.  This is better than Christmas.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  This, I'm just looking at the website.  I'm not going to say anything quite yet. 
[00:53:00]  But as I look at this, this would be a good parody of a radio show.  Yeah, this can't be real, right?  It has all the features.  It's got the hole.  It's got the old guy, the young buck.  It's got the radio veteran.  Right, the veteran.  And the wild guy.  I bet he's wild.  Oh, yeah, he is.  And then that guy.  It's got a name that's lame.  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's pretty much the hot format of the country right now.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone's going to sports radio. 
[00:53:30]  She keeps everything under control, I bet.  Don't let those guys.  Because that guy, the young buck there, he probably gets crazy.  And the old radio veteran.  And the hole.  Who, of course, why wouldn't she be overweight?  Look at this website, Jimmy.  It has all the features.  This is Jacktober's everything.  And it looks like they all just get along.  Hey, come on.  Hey, look at us.  There it is.  Where in Canada?  Today. 
[00:54:00]  Hey.  Ontario.  We go to Ontario, Canada.  And 94.5, the Bull's.  The Bull.  Bullpen.  It's the morning show that the Bull is the bullpen.  This gentleman with the salt and pepper hair.  Yeah.  Is Bruffer.  What's Bruffer?  Well, I guess his name is Mike Bruff.  Oh, but they call him the Bruffer.  So he's Bruffer.  Hey.  That's like the opster.  It's the Bruffer.  Hold on.  Hey, Kenny.  The Bruffer.  Can you keep a list of all these so when I go into markets, we can just check off the 
[00:54:30]  ones to tell the club to not try?  Don't bother.  Because that's the most embarrassing part is when you try to get on one that you've  jocked over.  Yeah.  It gives them a little bit of fucking, a little bit of payback.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tell you, go fuck yourself.  There's this wild guy that you might know him as Kevin Fell, but in the mornings, he's  K-Fell.  K-Fell.  K-Fell.  Why K-Fell?  K-Fell and the Bruffer?  Because any Kevin, it becomes a K.  And of course, Janice McKay, a.k.a. 
[00:55:00]  Mack.  Oh, they got some nice names, right?  They got the good names.  Bruffer, Mack, and K-Fell.  Oh, yeah.  94.5, the bull.  You're listening to the bullpen.  Hey, Mack.  Hey, what's going on?  Do they have sound effects of a bull hitting a bat?  Not that I heard, no.  Do they have a brrrr, like a bull?  That'd be good.  A little bit of that.  A little bit of that.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm guessing here.  All right.  Well, we got Katie Sunshine calling in a few minutes, so we should get a couple clips 
[00:55:30]  from this show off.  At least wet our tootsies a little in this wonderfulness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of Jacktober.  All right.  Jacktober has begun with the bullpen with Bruffer, Mack, and K-Fell on Ontario, Canada's  94.5, the bull.  That's right.  Wendell Clark, the hockey player, is calling in later, and K-Fell has a totally crazy idea.  I love Jacktober.  Oh, I've been waiting all year.  It's a big guest for the show. 
[00:56:00]  I think this is the only reason we re-signed with Sirius.  Just because we knew.  They're like, we have to do Jacktober.  Is that what they did?  Management was like, listen, guys.  Right.  You know Jacktober is Monday.  You don't have to re-sign, but.  That's why we have a one-month deal.  Listen.  Wendell Clark is like, they're very excited about this guest.  Now, K-Fell is known to get a little.  K-Fell's the crazy guy.  A little rambunctious.  I don't want to confuse him with Mac.  Right.  No, Mac is, she's, I'm glad Mac's there. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Because what she does is, she lets things go to a certain level, but when it's time to keep things under control.  Oh, thank God.  You think she has an actual yield and stop sign in the studio?  Yeah.  Eek.  Here we go.  The Rock Station 94.5, the full rocket's out here on at 91.7.  We may have Wendell Clark on the show today.  We're giddy like school kids, I'm telling you, Mac. 
[00:57:00]  Are you all hooked up, too?  Oh, you are, too.  Good.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Because Mac's just excited because this is going to be the first time in her life she ever sees me speechless.  I can't wait.  Oh, I hope that happens.  I'll get to ask all the questions then.  I'll be like Chris Farley.  Hopefully.  I'll do a Chris Farley on him.  He'd probably appreciate that.  Wendell's got a great sense of humor, by the way.  Remember when he fought McSorley?  Do it, do it.  I dare you.  Double dog.  You won't do it.  You're chicken.  Double dog?  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:30]  He's chicken?  I swear to God, you would think this was an SNL parody.  Oh.  This is real shit.  Hey.  What a radio voice, though, huh?  I like that riddle.  Hey.  He sounds like nearly a thousand people I've heard on the radio.  That's all you hear after all.  That's all you hear.  It's just a rhythm.  Oh, awesome.  And Kay fell.  He wants to do, you know, the Chris Farley thing.  Well, that's crazy.  Should I say cray cray?  That's cray cray.  You could.  But Bruffer is there to be like, you're a little chicken. 
[00:58:00]  You'll never do it.  You're a little chicken, but thank God Max there.  Nova Scotia's pissed.  Ontario's a province.  All right.  Whatever.  Whatever it is.  Whatever.  I just look at it as one big station.  What is that?  Stop it, Canada.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm watching we said Ontario.  D.C. is a district of Columbia.  Exactly.  Shut up.  So what do we got?  A double dog dare or something going down there?  That's right.  He double dog dares and he won't do it.  He's chicken.  Chicken.  What do you want him to do?  I don't know. 
[00:58:30]  I forgot already.  The Chris Farley skit where he goes, remember when you did this?  That was awesome.  Oh, during the interview with McCartney?  Yeah.  It's very funny.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, it was funny.  He's saying that when Wendell Clark calls in, he's going to do the Chris Farley.  Ah.  And then Bruffer goes, I double dog dare you.  And then he goes, you won't do it.  You're chicken.  He didn't really say double dog dare you.  Oh, he certainly did.  Well, we could go and check the end of the clip.  He didn't really say that.  He certainly, certainly did say that.  I won't hold you to this one, though.  I won't hold you to this one. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, wow.  No, I will.  Mack, hold him down.  That's clip two.  No, you're going to be nuts.  Oh, boy.  Boy, they sound like a lot of fun, though.  I disagree.  He'd probably appreciate that.  Wendell's got a great sense of humor, by the way.  Remember when he fought McSorley?  Do it.  Do it.  I dare you.  Double dog.  You won't do it.  You're chicken.  Double dog.  Double dog.  I dare you.  Double dog.  Double dog.  That's serious.  Double dog dares are pretty rough.  No, double dog.  It was Mack and her sister were in the studio at the time. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, that's the type of thing that K-Fell thinks to himself, I'm kind of pinned up against  a wall here.  I really got to go through with this crazy prank.  Well, when did we get to hear the Wendell Clark?  I didn't even bother with it.  He didn't do it.  Of course.  Oh, he just didn't do it?  It was an interview with a hockey player.  He didn't do it.  No, of course not.  Yeah, because we got to let people know this is like all the highlights of one show.  Yeah, this is one day.  Right.  So they got to the Wendell Clark and it was just nothing?  It was a who gives a fuck interview? 
[01:00:00]  Yes, of course it was.  So he lost a double dare?  He lost a double dog dare?  Yeah.  Double dog dare?  But he didn't do what he said he was going to do?  No, Bruffer was right.  He was chicken.  Double dog.  Yeah.  These guys are fucking good.  Ah, you like them, Chip?  Yeah.  Yeah, they are.  Just fun, right?  Yeah, everybody's just joking around.  So I guess we just got to move on, huh?  That's it.  That was it for the Wendell Clark coverage.  KFL agrees to do something based on a Prep Burger news story. 
[01:00:30]  Remember Prep Burger people?  We like to educate the audience as well and beat the shit out of everyone.  Prep Burger is a service where you could subscribe to and they'll give you your jokes every morning.  Yeah.  Because they're not good enough to come up with their own jokes.  Are they still in existence?  It's a whole industry.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a whole industry.  They make parodies for you.  Nice.  Topical humor, right?  Yeah, they have topical humor.  They actually have answers.  We did it one year.  Right.  They have answers to interviews.  Nice.  So you could pretend like we did it with Alan Alda, I think. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, can we do that again this year?  Sure.  We can find it.  There's so much we got to do.  It's October.  But they also have like the wacky news stories of the day.  And so when you start flipping around radio stations, you realize they're all talking about the same wacky news stories.  Right.  It's because they're just, they're not even researching.  Yeah.  How is it that you, wow, you go on the radio and have a radio show and you can't come up with your own shit?  I don't know.  A lot of radio shows do it, though.  A lot of them.  Prep Burger.  And that's really like, Prep Burger people go, ah, it's harmless. 
[01:01:30]  It's just helping people have fun.  But it's just, it's helping uncreative and lazy people seem funny.  And it's like, there's a lot of really funny and creative people that could probably go on and do this job if they were giving it to a lot of what happened.  Uh-oh, I'm seeing, uh, what happened.  This is not good.  What happened?  I'm at their Facebook page.  Oh.  They're on Facebook.  Right.  And, uh, there's a picture of, uh, I don't know, the bruffer and K-Fell with somebody, I guess a hockey player or something.  And the, uh, comment is, today's your day, shit fucks. 
[01:02:00]  Today's your day.  Nice.  And, uh, you know, you can go through their wall.  Well, people are pissed there is no Facebook for the bull.  No, there, there isn't.  Yeah, but you're reading off their Facebook page.  I don't know if we can, uh, should we go?  Yeah, I mean, if you go to the, if you Google the station.  Yeah, we don't really encourage, uh, to take over the Facebook pages.  If it happens, we can't, you know, we can't control it.  I do think it's funny, but I, oh, yeah, we, uh.  All I did was Google the station and then click the thing that says Facebook. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, look, Fatty Pig Fatty has, um, Paul Hargis' birthday wish up there.  Oh, that's a good one.  There's a picture of a jack-o-lantern with a woman sucking a man's dick.  I'm the jack-o-lantern.  Instead of the eyes and nose and it's pretty fucking good.  A big fat lump of shit trying to get into her jeans.  This is not good.  It says, uh, there's a picture by somebody claiming to be Sam Roberts.  It's a fake, uh, Sam Roberts, uh, Facebook page. 
[01:03:00]  It says, like if you love Jesus, ignore for devil.  And it's a picture of an apple with legs and a lot of pubic hair and a giant penis coming out of his underwear.  Giant dick coming out of it.  So the listeners have, uh, started.  Oh, God.  He's a big black man having sex with what appears to be an inflatable purple pigeon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, why don't we get on to the next clip here and then we're going to talk to Katie Sunshine.  Oh, boy.  Uh, KFL agrees to do something based on a prep burger news story. 
[01:03:30]  What's that there, Sam?  Without reading the story, what does that mean?  Yeah, it's like they had this prep burger, uh, uh, news story that they wanted to get to.  And KFL.  Was it wacky news?  It's wacky.  The news story is a little crazy.  Okay.  But you want to talk about crazy.  KFL agrees to do something without even knowing what the article says.  That's insane.  And it's like, you know, it's one thing to dip your foot in the water.  But if you're just going to dive in without checking the kind of guy he is, though.  That's the kind of guy he is. 
[01:04:00]  KFL's a little edgy.  Yeah.  Morning madness.  You think he's a little unpredictable?  He is.  That's the thing.  He's nuts.  And then what did you say?  Luckily, Mac is there as things drift out of control.  Oh, God.  If you listen to the whole, towards the end of the clip, things start to go a little crazy.  So, thank God there's somebody to keep in mind.  All right.  You may be checking to do this, although you agreed to do this before you knew any of the information here.  Which I really have to stop doing.  Yeah, I know you do have to stop.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck kind of delivery does he have? 
[01:04:30]  He's crazy, Ant.  I told you.  Oh, he's nuts.  Oh, like Bobcat.  Right.  Oh!  He's just...  I really have to stop doing that!  He's got no gauge on when he's supposed to sell the emotion.  He's just like, oh, I just start screaming now.  Like, there's no reason for him to be that upset yet.  He might be channeling Chris Farley.  We all love Chris Farley, right?  Right.  He's explaining why things are so out of control.  He's like, I gotta stop doing these things.  Yeah.  He's basically saying, I gotta look before I leap!  And if we believe the premise of what's happening, he doesn't know what the news story is yet, 
[01:05:00]  so he doesn't even know if he should be upset.  Right, right.  It could be something good.  But this is him on a regular day.  Yeah, it's crazy.  You may be checking to do this, although you agreed to do this before you knew any of the information here.  Which I really have to stop doing!  Yeah, I know you do have to stop doing that.  This is great news, though.  Scientists have figured out a way for men to live longer.  Not women.  Yeah.  Men.  And I don't have to change anything about the way I live now.  Well, that's sexist.  No, you don't have to change a thing.  Oh, God.  The whole.  There's the women's point of view. 
[01:05:30]  The whole.  Well, that's sexist.  Yeah.  Why would she make a joke there?  Exactly.  Why not just jump in?  Like, everyone's laughing, and all of a sudden she puts a picture of a tumor on the table.  Way to be fun.  That's sexist.  Oh, God.  Anything about the way I live now.  Well, that's sexist.  No, you don't have to change a thing.  But if we want to live longer.  A thing about the way you live right now.  You already live longer.  Oh.  You have to have your package cut off, though.  No.  Oh.  Like, right off.  Yeah.  Like, what's part of the package?  The whole deal? 
[01:06:00]  What?  What's going on there?  Like, the twig and giggle berries gone.  All of it?  Gone.  Yeah.  Scientists.  He didn't say that.  Please.  Please.  Oh.  I know.  It's regular radio.  A K-Fowl is not afraid.  He didn't say that.  I definitely got to, like, chill on that one.  Who says that?  No one.  The giggle berries.  The twig and giggle berries.  Even when we had to, like, work around some rules, we came up with junk a long time ago.  Twig and giggle berries.  You think when they're doing an appearance somewhere, like, five people in a bar, some  guy will come up and go, hey, how's your twig and giggle berries? 
[01:06:30]  Like, hey, I listen.  Maybe they have bumper stickers that refer to the three of them as the twig and giggle  berries.  Nice.  Straight off.  Yes.  Like, what's part of the package?  The whole deal?  What?  What's going on there?  Like, the twig and giggle berries gone.  All of it?  Gone.  Yeah.  Scientists have studied genealogy records of ancient Korea and found that men who were castrated  lived an average of 14 to 19 years longer than men who got to keep their stones.  That's weird.  Listen.  But maybe that's just because then you don't have the same testosterone levels and stuff. 
[01:07:00]  See, this would change nothing.  And then you don't get into fights and die.  Well, I don't use it anyway.  I don't use it, but I'd like to keep it around just in case.  I love when you agree to stuff before you find the deal.  I won't hold you to this one, though.  All right.  I will not hold you to this one.  Wow.  No, I will.  Mac, hold him down.  No, you've got to be nuts.  Oh, no.  No.  What's going on?  That sounds just like Amy Schumer when she did the voice for the whole on Louisville.  Exactly.  That's exactly like that. 
[01:07:30]  And Bruffer was actually asking her to hold down their sidekick while he castrates him.  While he cuts his dick and balls off, and she was like, no.  It was important for Mac to say no, because otherwise they would have castrated a man live in the studio.  You think they would have went through it?  Yes, absolutely.  That's not what I tune in the bullpen for.  No.  I tune in for some fun, a couple of laughs, maybe something interesting.  But there's all these dares, and there's no payoff to their dares.  You're chicken.  He keeps calling them chicken. 
[01:08:00]  They're all for two.  You guys have been in radio for a long time.  What are you sure I have, Sam?  Do you think that they really did, during the commercial break, say, listen, K-Fell, you've got to promise to do it?  And K-Fell was like, look, I don't know, but I'll do it.  I will.  Absolutely.  You think so?  Yeah.  Just go along with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't worry.  In the end, you don't have to be castrated.  But let's go along with it.  We can have a little fun with this, I think.  Oh, God.  K-Fell sounds a little bit like Chris Griffin, too.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  Oh, he's trying so hard to be a character. 
[01:08:30]  Well, we've got to hold on with Jocktober, because we've got Katie Sunshine on the line.  Ah.  There's a little taste of Jocktober as we kick it off today with the bullpen with Bruffer, Mac, and K-Fell.  And there's Canada's 94.5 The Bull.  There's a lemon party going on on their Facebook page.  But let's talk to Katie Sunshine, then we'll get back to Jocktober.  Katie.  Give us a visual.  Hi, Katie.  Hi.  How are you?  Oh.  Well, hi there.  We are much better.  I feel like I'm talking to a huge celebrity. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, thank you.  We discovered you because of the video that was done at WinFest.  Yes.  Yes.  Who filmed that?  My husband actually filmed it.  Damn it!  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was speaking for the entire audience.  Yeah, you really are.  Your husband.  Oh, thank you.  Well, I thought he was just taking my picture.  And so I just kept pausing and smiling because I thought I was posing for a picture. 
[01:09:30]  I didn't know he was taking a video of it.  Right.  Oh, really?  We were wondering, because we've watched this.  I've gone over this more than people went over the Zapruder film.  And I noticed that a lot of the guys aren't looking at you, and we all wondered why.  And then I speculated, I bet you that there's a big guy filming her, and that's why the men  aren't stopping just to stare because there's a man filming.  Well, my husband has a very large beard, and so that could be part of the reason. 
[01:10:00]  What kind of guy is he?  He's a really nice guy.  He's a pretty big guy.  But I really think the reason was I've been doing that all day.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they were used to seeing me.  I would never get used to seeing that.  I would be staring at you the entire time.  These guys with a blue cooler in the background, they don't care.  What's wrong with these guys?  By that time, when I first started hula hooping that day, I would have a few people gather  around me.  But like I said, I didn't get hours by that time. 
[01:10:30]  So they're just like, oh, there's a hula hoop girl again.  You've done a lot of videos, huh?  Yes, quite a few.  But this one seems to have really taken off.  This one's going everywhere.  Yeah, and I don't really know why, because I didn't do any editing.  I didn't dress up in any costumes.  That's the beauty of it.  The yoga pants?  You've got to be kidding me.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe it's the tight pants.  You don't realize you're a very good-looking woman?  Well.  And that you can move very nicely? 
[01:11:00]  Well, I just love hula hooping.  I love hula hooping.  You love hula hooping.  And you've made me love it.  How long have you been hula hooping?  I've been hula hooping for about four years now.  Oh.  That's it?  Mm-hmm.  Usually, you know, you're a kid when you start that.  Well, I could hula hoop when I was a kid.  And, you know, like most adults, at some point you just stop.  You don't hula hoop anymore.  And then I picked it up when I was about, I don't know, 22, 23. 
[01:11:30]  Okay.  And I had completely forgotten how the hoops would grow up the weight.  Yeah.  I was just doing a little math.  Yeah.  She's perfect.  Now, are you from Arkansas originally?  I am.  I was born and raised in Arkansas.  But now you live in the Philly area?  No, I still live in Arkansas.  I'm just a Philly fan and an Eagles fan.  Yeah, so how did that?  Oh, I love this guy.  Hold on. 
[01:12:00]  That fucking drunk.  The guy who just drunkenly sings to you and walks away?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and he was totally singing the wrong song, too.  Yeah.  No, we know that.  He was singing a little Neil Young for everybody.  Yeah.  Wait, so how do you become a Philly's Eagles fan if you're from Arkansas?  Well, I became a Philly's fan because I've got a huge crush on Chase Utley.  And then I became an Eagles fan when some other Eagles fans sent me all the gear to make the 
[01:12:30]  hula hoop, the Eagles hula hoop video.  Right.  And they just contacted me.  They said, you know, if we send you this stuff, will you do a hula hoop video in our gear?  And I was like, sure, of course.  So, and then we started talking back and forth, and they were so nice.  I ended up being an Eagles fan, too.  There you go.  Wow.  And you're a school teacher, right?  I am.  I teach art.  I'm the elementary art teacher at my school.  Oh, good God.  Oh, that's adorable. 
[01:13:00]  God, when I took art in school, I didn't have a teacher like you.  Do you notice all the...  I think mine was half a fruit.  I believe he was making dresses for Cher, I really, I think.  No, he actually was, but I think he, whatever.  Do the fathers have any, has any, like, parents commented on these videos to you?  Yeah.  Um, not many have seen my videos that I know of, but I hula hoop for the kids sometime at  the school, so they all know I hula hoop. 
[01:13:30]  Oh.  I don't know if they've seen my videos.  I try not to advertise those too much at school.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  I'm sure eventually some idiot will have a problem with your videos at school.  Yeah, I'm sure.  That's kind of, I've been holding my breath for that, but so far nothing bad has happened.  Hey, why do you have such a crappy backyard?  Uh, I really don't.  Just...  Do you need some, do you need some money for landscaping?  Because we're distracted by the, the burnt out grass in some of your videos. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I know.  It is bad.  I know, I know.  I've been hoping that I could get accepted maybe onto one of those shows where, you know,  the people come in and they totally remodel your backyard.  Well, they'll do that for you.  Uh, are you getting, um, calls from, like, Hollywood or anything?  Any, any talk shows, anything?  Uh, I've been getting a lot of, um, emails from, like, clip shows, uh, that want to use  my clip and, I don't know, make fun of it, I guess. 
[01:14:30]  Probably make fun of my backyard.  Uh...  Well, like who?  Who's been calling you?  There was one show called Clipaholics, um, and I was on that show.  They used my, my clip and they, uh, well, they did, like, a little history of the hula  hoop segment and basically they just zoomed in on my boobs and my butt.  It was good.  Ah.  Oh, boy.  They, they used you.  They used you for your assets.  That is a selling point, though.  It is a selling point, but we do like the whole package there, Katie.  Well, thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  You really hula hoop well.  Yeah, you got some of those wacky moves, you know?  Thanks.  Thanks.  I like, I like the, uh, shoulder one.  That's a good trick where you spin it on your shoulder.  Uh-huh.  And, and then I like the other one where you just kind of hold it and, and, uh, move  it up and down.  You must drive your neighbors crazy.  We're looking at, we're looking at the one where you're in your front yard.  It's gotta be a lot of guys peeking through their windows as you film this stuff.  Yeah, wearing white puffy boots.  All sexy.  Little shorts. 
[01:15:30]  You know, there's a guy across the street that's loose in his mind.  Of course.  That's the big joke is there's no telling what my neighbors think of me.  I could guess what they're thinking.  Yeah, if you didn't think to know.  Yeah.  I think we can figure that out for you.  How's, how's the marriage going?  It's great.  We have been married for about a year and a half, but we've been together forever.  We, we dated for seven years before we got married.  Oh, okay.  I was hoping there might be some struggles.  Struggles. 
[01:16:00]  Our whole audience is hoping that.  Struggles.  Sorry, no struggles.  So now, what do you want to do?  Do you want to teach school or is this something else you want to do like in the creative field?  Um, well, really art has been my passion my entire life.  If I could do anything, it would just be paint all day and sell my paintings for $10,000 a piece.  Where are your paintings?  Are they online anywhere?  Yes, I have them on my Katie Sunshine Facebook page.  Oh, you do. 
[01:16:30]  Let's look at your paintings.  Let's see how good it is.  Yeah, I didn't.  What does your husband do for 11?  He is an undercover narcotics officer.  Oh, shit.  Which translates into a really tough fucking dude.  Wow.  Yeah, he's going to fucking break some teeth.  Yeah, big narc with a beard.  That guy's a problem.  He, exactly, he's a problem.  Do you worry about him doing that line of work?  Am I worried about him?  Do you worry about that line of work?  That's a rough one.  Um, not really. 
[01:17:00]  He's, I mean, I worry about him sometimes, but for the most part, he's pretty competent, so.  Okay.  I like your painting of the trees with the leaves changing.  Oh, thank you.  I really do, actually.  Thanks.  It's not bad at all.  What's your Facebook page so people can check this shit out, too?  All right, great.  No, what is your Facebook page?  No, what is the page?  What is the page?  Yeah.  Uh, it's just, search for Katie Sunshine.  Okay.  Hey, you did something with the Philly Fanatic on the dugout? 
[01:17:30]  Yes, that was so much fun.  We interviewed him many years ago.  Did you notice how poorly the outfits smelled on him?  Oh, no, I didn't notice, actually.  Oh, you should have.  Maybe because I was so nervous to be up there in front of all those people.  Were you afraid you were going to drop your hula hoop?  I was.  Well, it was kind of drizzling that day, and they asked me, they said, are you sure you  can still do this?  Because the top of the dugout gets kind of slippery when it gets wet.  And I was like, oh, shit. 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to get up there and slip and fall and fall off the dugout, and everybody in the  stadium is going to have a video of it, and then it's going to be everywhere on the  internet.  That's what I was afraid of.  You did great, though.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I was so glad I didn't back out, because I was.  I was so nervous.  But if you fell, it would have been a great video, though.  I mean, even though this is hot, there would have been a very funny video, a hot girl falling  with a hula hoop into the dugout.  Were any guys yelling things at you? 
[01:18:30]  Um, there were, I could only, I could hear some cheers, and I could hear some whistles,  but I couldn't really hear anybody yelling anything at me.  How annoyed were you that that big, fat, green thing had to dance next to you and try to  get attention for itself while you're up there doing something really good?  I love the Philly Phanatic.  She's too nice.  Katie Sunshine is just too nice.  Katie Sunshine is just a nice lady.  You're just nice.  Thank you.  We don't know how to handle people that are just nice people.  She's got to be a nice elementary school teacher. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  You've got to deal with the kids.  What age do you teach?  I teach kindergarten all the way up to sixth grade.  Sure.  Wow.  Nice.  Do you want to have kids of your own?  I don't know.  I have a stepson.  My husband has a son.  Okay.  So he's, you know, he's kind of been my kiddo.  I don't know if we'll ever have any kids of our own or not.  How old is he, your stepson?  He just turned 14.  Oh, my God.  Does he love you? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Stepson.  Well, I think, I don't know, I use the who-loving thing as, like, blackmail.  You know, I think I am always threatening to show up to one of his events with all his  friends there.  Oh, yeah.  That would be terrible.  Yeah.  They must love, his friends must absolutely love you.  Look at that kid that says, Mom.  Yeah, I want to go over to your house.  Yeah, how many, yeah, exactly.  Can we go over to your house today?  I bet you he brings a lot of friends over to your house.  Oh, well, he lives with his mama in Mountainburg, which is about two hours from us. 
[01:20:00]  So we see him, he's pretty far away.  We see him on the weekends and in the summertime and spring break and all that good stuff.  All right.  Well, Katie, we're glad we got to talk to you.  Yes, you're very, you're lovely like we figured you'd be.  Nice lady.  Oh, thank you.  Well, thank you so much for having me on.  No problem.  Any other interviews or what?  Um, no, I haven't had nothing I know of yet. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  I sent your video to Jimmy Fallon.  I said, yo, Jimmy, get her on.  Oh, thank you.  Well, nothing happened.  But I tried for you.  I would put this on a talk show in a second.  Yeah, me too.  In a second.  Well, thank you, guys.  Well, look, and if things don't work out, you know, marriage can be tough.  There are other options.  I just wanted you to know that.  How about this?  Okay.  Thanks for looking out for me.  Katie, how about we give you some Opie and Anthony t-shirts and you make a little video for us? 
[01:21:00]  Just a little one.  I would love to.  I would love to.  Oh, yeah.  That would be nice to put up on the site.  Yeah, put it on the site.  And I think our fans would love that.  Yes, I think so, too.  Yeah.  I like the yoga pants, but I do like the cutoff shorts, too.  Yes.  Well, I talked about it in the Eagle suit video.  Yep.  Yeah.  I said, you guys just have to send me a jersey and some boots.  I said, I've got the cutoffs.  I'm an Arkansas girl.  Everybody has those here.  Well, we're going to cut the shirt down a little bit, if you know what I mean. 
[01:21:30]  A little bit.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a line, Katie.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, Katie.  Katie Sunshine, everyone, from the hula hoop video.  She's just nice.  Very nice.  She's like really nice.  She's exactly what I figured she'd be.  Really?  Yeah.  A really nice.  Just like an innocence to her.  Because she's a schoolteacher.  She's not going to come on and be dirty or bitchy as a schoolteacher.  Right.  And then she's got a few of those, what you call, provocative moves when she's doing that hula hoop. 
[01:22:00]  You think?  You think she knows she has some provocative moves?  Yeah.  She knows how to play it just right.  Because she knows those kids' parents are going to possibly check out these videos.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So she's got to be good about it.  She bends over, but she's like, no, I'm not bending over to show my hiney.  I've got to bend over to keep the hula hoop rotating.  That's pretty provocative right there.  She's in a black leather skirt.  Oh, she's got those giant leopard boots on.  Oh, she's fantastic. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, it's two light-up hula hoops.  But you can't see her.  You can't see her, so.  See, that's not smart.  Nobody wants to see lighted hula hoops.  Nah.  Yeah.  I only want to see her.  Oh, there.  Okay.  Now she's off.  Look, I'm not wiggling my hiney.  I've got to keep the hula hoop going.  Yeah, it's just part of the, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I am bending over, but oops, I've got to get the hula hoop back up my body.  Oh, there it is.  That's that move.  When it's around her ankles, and then she's got to get it back up, she really moves. 
[01:23:00]  No, I'm not wiggling real fast to show off my ass.  I've got to get the hula hoop off the ground, everyone.  Oh, she's a little just bludgeoning her ample breast to scissors.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  She's a sensation.  Yeah, she really is.  I'm really surprised she hasn't done any shows yet.  She will.  Takes a little time with this shit, right?  She's a fucking narcotics.  Undercover narcotics cop.  She couldn't have mentioned a fucking tougher guy job. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  I was hoping he would do something really fruity.  What does he do?  He's a shoe salesman.  Yes.  He's a floral arranger.  Yes.  He's a party planner.  I've seen a photo of him, and then together.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's a big fucking dude, man.  Oh, you've done some studying, huh, Jimmy?  Of course.  Backed off immediately.  Oh, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  There's Katie Sunshine.  Very nice.  And we've got a break, and we're going to get back to Jacktober.  That's what we do today.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Serious, serious accents. 
[01:24:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Katie Sunshine for calling the show.  I think we're going to send some Wow and Opie and Anthony shit so she can do a hula hoop  video for us.  It's got to be the best one she does, though, right? 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because we've got to figure out how to make it better than the ones that are up there.  Oh, yeah.  She's just a nice lady.  Really?  You shouldn't say lady.  I mean, she's a woman.  She's very nice, though.  What the fuck is that?  There's a picture of a man cow with Bobo.  What?  Where did that come from?  That's the B-94, the bull Facebook page.  Oh, somebody.  Okay.  I didn't know he did man cow.  We're going back to Jacktober.  Jacktober.  Let's do this. 
[01:25:00]  Jacktober.  It begins today.  The whole month we feature radio shows from around the country and Canada.  And Canada.  And Canada this year.  This is special.  It is special.  The first show ever featured on Jacktober from Canada.  Canadian listeners have been asking for it for a long time.  They have.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They have Jacktober going on there, too.  The bullpen with Bruffer, Mack, and Kayfell.  That's what we're talking about today.  Of course.  94.5, the bull.  Ontario, Canada. 
[01:25:30]  Ontario.  Ontario, yes.  Ontario.  I'm sure people want recognition for it, too.  There is evidence of Hulk Hogan causing the collapse of the World Trade Center.  Wait, where's the one picture?  Oh, there it is.  Wait, where are you going?  I did this for you.  That is so stupid.  Hey, wait.  Like, he just totally didn't read the situation right.  No.  Wait, I did this for you.  Where are you going?  I like how he's doing his poses in the record. 
[01:26:00]  See, other people look at that picture like he's the evil one.  I don't know.  I see it as, wait, what happened?  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  He dropped a big boot on Tower 2.  Oh, he certainly did.  Fast forward.  Did you ever think we would be laughing at Hulk Hogan and Twin Tower pictures?  No.  But hilarious.  Obviously, 94.5, the bull thinks it's funny because it's on their Facebook page.  Oh, it's on their Facebook page.  He said, no, that chair.  That's my favorite.  It's just so wrong. 
[01:26:30]  Huge chair.  Yeah.  All right, let's get into another clip from the bullpen.  Thank God Prep Burger had some more wacky news.  Ah.  Yeah.  Where we replace punchlines with awkward laughing.  What's this about, Sam?  Well, sometimes, you know, the point is you read the wacky news story and you can come up  with your own little jokes and stuff.  Sure.  Or you could just read the news story, pause where there would normally be a punchline and  just kind of laugh. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Well, let's play it, all right?  Yeah.  Well, it's...  639 Brouffer, Mack, and Kay fell into Tuesday.  Welcome to the bullpen.  Partly sunny today.  High to 21, 12 degrees right now.  Oh, God.  The weather is over.  Who needs a radio station to tell you the fucking weather in this day and age?  And I was sitting in my house Saturday morning and I'm watching local news and they spent  five minutes on the weather.  I'm like, could someone tell these people we don't get our fucking weather from TV anymore?  Useless.  Useless. 
[01:27:30]  I mean, maybe the five-day forecast.  Put that up on the screen for 10 seconds.  I could get that online.  It's just...  I know, but why would you spend five fucking minutes describing the weather still?  No need.  I would assume this is one of their listeners because it's on their Facebook page.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They post the weather on their Facebook page, too.  Oh, nice.  Good thing.  And they write, today, partly to mostly sunny, high 17, winds west, 10 to 20.  Fuck, it's cold up there.  High 17?  Yeah.  Well, that's that selfie as shit.  And one of their listeners comments, with a 100% chance of AIDS. 
[01:28:00]  That's a very, very bad weather condition.  Terrible.  I'd hate to have a 100% chance of AIDS in the air.  Penn, partly sunny today.  High to 21, 12 degrees right now at the Bull.  Newport, Tennessee.  I don't know.  You guys decided, is there going to be a second date after this?  After what?  Don Peters arrested, charged with aggravated assault after she allegedly, allegedly, I say,  hit 51-year-old William L. Wolford on the head.  With a hammer.  At least five times, while they were having sex. 
[01:28:30]  Nailed him.  Nailed him.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Holy fuck.  Oh, shit.  And, of course, the Chris Griffin guy has to laugh, because he's the edgy guy.  He finds everything like that funny, right?  Because normally, it's like, if somebody getting hit in the head with a hammer, it's so dangerous.  That's not funny, but not for K-Fail.  This whole thing.  I could listen to that segment ten times just to get every nuance. 
[01:29:00]  The way he goes into the story is terrible.  It's just, hey, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Like, hey, I'm just conversing.  Yeah.  And then the hammer line.  And then nailed, which is the double entendre of fucking.  Yeah.  There might be a couple more double entendres.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Thunder Scoot, one of my regulars.  Someone's got to get this.  He just sent me a headline that says, being bullied?  Just act less gay, advised teachers. 
[01:29:30]  There you go.  Those teachers are in trouble.  I think they're in a little bit of trouble there.  Fucking Thunder Scoot.  Where did you find that article?  I want to read the whole fucking thing later.  Hey, you think, what did she cave?  Did she cave his ball sack in with that hammer?  Did he turn around and smash her cunt?  I think it's funny when he says twig and giggle berries, though.  You're still on that chip, boy.  That's hilarious.  My mother would always say,  Chipper, stop waving your twig and giggle berries. 
[01:30:00]  Lamar's going to see you.  Lamar's the one that did your mom?  No, he was helping her.  Yeah, helping her with the fork.  These guys are funny.  I'm just wondering why he would be in your house like that.  He fixes the rug.  Why is your hand in your pants, Chips?  It's touching my twig.  With a hammer.  At least five times while they were having sex.  Nailed him.  Nailed him.  That's right.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Gives a whole new meaning to she nailed him anyway.  And they were in the living room doing this.  Yeah, I know.  That's what she said. 
[01:30:30]  He just did her joke.  I know.  That's sort of what she said.  And he reacted to that like,  Whoa, that's crazy.  You got it.  It's a whole new meaning to the word nailed him.  You understood before, though, Opie.  Before K-Fell came and explained that.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Imagine if they did something totally bad like,  Yeah, nailed him.  Like Jesus on that cross.  Yeah.  Ah, the PD's running down the hall freaking out.  Yeah, he just said something funny like,  A hammer?  What was he, raping a child or something?  Oh, Chips. 
[01:31:00]  Man.  Come on.  Sex.  Nailed him.  Nailed him.  It's right.  Yes.  Whoa.  Gives a whole new meaning to she nailed him anyway.  And they were in the living room doing this, too.  Good.  Wonderful.  I guess she really knows how to handle him.  I guess she does.  Maybe he liked it rough.  Apparently during sex, she picked up a hammer for no apparent reason.  She nailed him on the head five times.  Yeah, I know.  You said that.  And then she runs out of the residence in a French maid outfit.  And get this.  I don't even understand how this made the story.  That she'd apparently purchased at Walmart. 
[01:31:30]  I know.  It's a cheap one.  That's all we know.  Well.  Oh, wow.  They had nothing.  We got to start saying Walmart more.  Yeah.  It gets laughs.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  They had nothing there.  A little more.  The one thing that this trio has is chemistry.  They do.  Nothing else.  They really do, Sam.  Yeah, like bleach and ammonia.  You know what I noticed?  The handle line was another hammer joke.  She was thinking that P. Wood knows how to handle him. 
[01:32:00]  Like, she's just trying to go through parts of a hammer in her head.  And find puns.  And there's only three parts to a hammer.  The hammer head, the handle, and the little wedge that keeps them both together.  Or the claw.  Other than that.  What about the claw?  Well, that's the whole head part.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's a separate part.  That's a whole other joke.  If you want to start breaking down the claw, you could have fucking done thalidomide baby  jokes.  I got that dumb claw, you know.  Fucking hell.  That dumb claw.  We squeeze a few more jokes out of that news story before getting to the unscientific 
[01:32:30]  survey.  A little daily feature.  All right.  On the bullpen.  The survey.  Now, she's 31, eh?  Mm-hmm.  Well, I mean, if he's not going to call her back, I wouldn't mind her number.  Give her a ring.  And maybe he was a real tool.  What happened?  She's just trying.  What happened?  She's fucking puns 101.  A real tool.  She got another one in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:33:00]  But none of us could figure out the tool.  No.  That's right.  She did get the tool thing.  And you see how the crazy one wants her number?  Yeah.  So he can call her.  Watch out, everyone.  He's wild.  I'm not afraid of her.  He'd like to date her.  I bet he never saw that coming.  Right.  That's another.  Yeah.  See?  Saw?  Ha ha.  See saw?  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I wonder if she said, stop hammer time.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  All right.  We heard you with the puns.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  I mean, if he's not going to call her back, I wouldn't mind her number. 
[01:33:30]  Give her a ring.  And maybe he was a real tool.  Ha ha ha.  I mean, she sounds like a delight on a first date.  Oh, yeah.  She sure does.  Yeah.  So on Scientific Survey Question, it is back for a second day because nobody answered directly  yesterday.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Oh, that's a hell of a segue.  Yeah.  You've got a new, the humor was all wrapped up.  They gave us, it's just before it's too much.  They've minded for enough jokes.  Yeah.  Like, leave them wanting more. 
[01:34:00]  Exactly.  We hit the pinnacle of this, of this pyramid before we start going down the other side.  Yeah.  Let's move on to the next hilarious thing.  Yeah.  A survey question?  Yeah.  The unscientific survey is there.  This is something a lot of radio shows don't do anymore.  Can you imagine if we could get away with a survey question that takes two days to answer?  Oh, my gosh.  How great our jobs would be?  Oh, my gosh.  Well, the reason it took them two days to answer is they say nobody had the correct answer.  No one gave a shit.  No one called.  Oh, no one called.  Well, the question was, what is the worst radio show in Canada? 
[01:34:30]  And they just didn't want to...  Yeah, they wanted one different answer.  Stop calling us.  How's their Facebook page going?  Not great.  We're in phase two.  Phase one we passed, which was deleting comments.  Oh, they started deleting comments.  Phase one is acknowledgement.  Acknowledgement.  Slash deleting comments.  Let's delete the shit out of our Facebook page.  Phase two...  What is phase two?  Yes.  ...is defense, which is blocking users.  Yeah, a lot of people are bummed out. 
[01:35:00]  I checked my Twitter.  They're bummed.  They got blocked.  And they're like, man, I was on a roll.  Why are they blocked me?  Are these guys on Twitter, too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they are.  They are?  They're all over the social media.  What is phase three?  Have we ever gotten to phase three?  We've gotten to...  Isn't phase three where they completely remove their Facebook page?  Yeah, that's...  I think we've had a couple of those.  We've had most of...  Most of these have gone through to phase three, which is removal of Facebook page.  Remove their page.  Yeah, yeah.  I love phase three.  It's just not stopping. 
[01:35:30]  I mean, you have now Jerry Shepardini.  Oh, Jerry Shepardini.  Who's chiming in with the...  Oh, my God.  There's a pro-lapse.  Pro-lapse dance.  And Jerry Shepardini is chiming in with the joke.  Him, or what is this?  A child rape or something?  These fucking assholes.  Jerry Shepardini.  So, I mean...  Well, let's get to the scientific survey. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, of course.  Christian, it is back for a second day because nobody answered correctly yesterday.  More than a third of men have made themselves look stupid while attempting to impress a woman doing this.  What is it, guys?  Some of the most popular answers yesterday.  Dancing.  Actually, dancing was the big one.  All of us look a little silly dancing, don't we?  Well, I think I know this one.  Listen.  Jerking off over a cracker.  Shitting their pants.  Farting in her face. 
[01:36:30]  Faking their own death.  Guys have tried to impress a woman by doing this.  Impress a woman by doing this.  But it's a scientific survey?  Unscientific survey.  Unscientific.  Oh, fuck.  I was thinking scientific.  Somebody just posted twig and giggle berries for the win.  Twig and giggle berries.  For the win.  As in, that joke was so good.  Oh, yeah.  You've won the day.  You think they hate that we're focusing on them today? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, they hate it.  You think they're very distracted and off their game right now?  Hey, there's no worse news for a terrestrial radio show than today you're being featured  on Jocktober.  No worse news.  Because they all know about it, too.  It's so true.  I hear from radio friends from around the country, and they're like, fuck, dude.  Everyone knows about this Jocktober thing.  The next 31 days is just a time when all radio stations are in fear.  Those pricks are deleting as fast as shit gets posted. 
[01:37:30]  Let me get somebody on the case.  Actually, dancing was the big one, right?  All of us look a little silly dancing, don't we?  Well, yeah.  You do.  Hey, listen.  Is that for Kay Falemine?  I got the moves like Jagger, me and Bruffer.  I'm like nonstop erotic cabaret when I'm on the dance floor.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I am.  It's just me, then.  No, no.  Sorry.  Heads down, no-nonsense, mindless boogie.  That's the Bruffer.  You know what dance I love?  The old man at the wedding reception dance.  Oh, that's a good one, too.  It's my favorite.  I like the crazy uncle with the lampshades dance.  Yeah, my Uncle Bill.  Yeah, Uncle Bill.  Anyways, that's not the right answer, right? 
[01:38:00]  No.  1-877-945-BOL-1-877-7...  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Is that their phone number?  Yeah.  I mean...  Oh, no.  Is that their phone number?  I didn't hear that.  Oh, no.  I want to hear the last joke.  Hold on.  I didn't hear that.  Yeah, let's hear the last joke.  I like the crazy uncle with the lampshade dance.  Oh, my Uncle Bill.  Yeah, Uncle Bill.  Anyways, that's not the right answer.  No.  1-877-945-BOL-1-877-...  Oh, wow.  The lampshade dance.  Is that where you put your peanut through the lampshade? 
[01:38:30]  And you say, look at this.  It's a snake light.  Kiss the snake light.  Two photos posted on their Facebook.  Yeah.  One of Ric Flair having his tights pulled down by Hulk Hogan.  Yes.  These are men in their 60s, and Ric Flair's ass is showing.  And the other is a picture of the bullpen, except Mac's photo has been replaced by a giant black cock.  Oh.  Yes.  Fucking people. 
[01:39:00]  Yes.  I think it's stellar.  I think this is more fun, man.  Just see what the fucking listeners do with this shit.  Oh, my God.  They're actually doing Jocktober.  Yes, please.  What happens next?  Yeah, it just continues, I guess.  And then finally the answer.  Wait.  What happened?  I believe we've entered, I incorrectly said phase three.  I believe we've entered phase three.  What's phase three?  Lockout.  Which is they lock their wall so that only they can post on their wall.  Ah.  Oh, no.  So what do we do now? 
[01:39:30]  However, you can still comment on their posts.  Right.  For instance, their last post was from Friday, so they're deleting everything from today.  And this post says, way to go, Jake from Zurich.  Got the code and wins a key.  First comment.  I thought Jerry from Shepardini won.  Tell them about Jerry Shepardini right now.  So you can comment on their posts.  Yes.  All right, good.  Stick with the first post because that's the one we're all watching right now.  Yeah.  So they continue to get an answer and I guess it's excitement or something. 
[01:40:00]  On scientific survey, more than a third of men made themselves look stupid while attempting  to impress a woman doing this.  What is this?  Good morning.  Bullpen.  Who's this?  Good morning.  It's Gwen calling.  Gwen, how are you?  I'm good.  What do you think it is?  Well, I was just sitting there and you had said it was close with the other guy.  What about when he's trying to open the bottle of wine?  Congratulations.  Oh.  That's it.  Good.  You've got it, Gwen.  You've qualified for a shot at a key for the Bulls Ultimate Guys Garage 5. 
[01:40:30]  Great.  Has somebody tried to impress you by opening wine and champagne?  Yes, with his asshole.  He put the bottle in his asshole and he told me to put my feet against his back and pull.  Why would you ask that question?  A guy's ever tried to impress you by opening up a bottle of wine.  Oh, God. 
[01:41:00]  That is so stupid.  The whole thing is dumb.  But you win a chance for the guy's ultimate garage.  Yeah.  Which has a speaker with this show playing through it and then towels you can put under the door  and a fucking exhaust pipe hose.  That's the ultimate guy's garage.  It's like a takeoff on the man cave, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's the bull.  Come on.  The bullpen.  They're giving away a man cave.  Has somebody tried to impress you by opening wine and champagne? 
[01:41:30]  Um, I can't say they have.  No, but they should.  I think they will.  Yeah.  Well, Gwen, thank you.  I'm going to put you on hold for a quick minute, but who feeds your need to rock?  94.5 the bull.  Oh, who feeds your need to rock?  Oh, who thought that one up?  Here's an angle for this Jack-Tober.  You've got to come up with all those fucking slogans.  Who feeds your need to rock?  For rock.  Well, who does it? 
[01:42:00]  If not 94.5 the bull.  I'm going to guess 94.5 the bull feeds my need for rock.  My God, man.  Yes.  I, I'm not going to read this one out loud, but I.  Well, where is that from?  It's from their Facebook.  Someone wrote on their Facebook, Men's Health, asked.  They, well, they asked the question, and then one of their listeners, I guess, answered it.  Oh, Men's Health asked as male readers, if your wife or girlfriend offered you one gift from the following list, what would you pick?  And the answer is, no nigs for a year would be great.  That's what one of their listeners commented on their Facebook. 
[01:42:30]  But is that a, they're saying that's a list?  No, no, no.  They decided they didn't like the list, and they had their own answer.  Yeah, they had their own suggestion.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, my God.  So, let's keep track of slogans this year.  Who feeds your need for rock?  Yeah.  And let's vote best slogan ever this year.  So, keep track of that.  Feeds your need.  Who feeds your need to rock?  Who feeds your need to rock?  Hey, has anybody ever impressed you by opening a wine bottle?  Well, yes, I was on one day where he smashed the bottle against my forehead, and they made me lick it off the ground like a dog. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, he kicked my spine.  Hey, where's Travis?  We're going to go back to Jacktober.  We've got like a couple more clips to play, but Travis was at that Jack White show.  What a douche Jack White is.  Yeah, Sam, you're a big fucking Jack White fan.  What a douche bag.  You got his name tattooed on your arm.  Yeah.  He's a dick.  He was on Saturday.  Why?  What a dick dick.  I don't know.  Well, here's the story. 
[01:43:30]  I guess he played where?  Radio City?  Yes.  And he played for maybe 45 minutes, and he was in a bad mood or something, walked off the stage, and there was almost a riot there.  People were fucking pissed.  Yeah, he didn't like the sound.  And they were trying to give back their merchandise and everything that they bought.  Instead of acknowledging from the stage, like, hey, look, the sound is off.  I apologize.  It's not our fault.  It's this shitty venue.  Is that the excuse he's given?  That's a bullshit excuse.  Oh, okay.  Well, he has to come up with something.  The sound was fine.  To save face.  You can't say I was upset at some guy in the crowd, or I don't think the crowd was really into me, so I left. 
[01:44:00]  So what happened, Travis?  You were there.  Yeah, I mean...  Sold-out show, obviously.  Sold-out show.  How close were you?  I was on the floor maybe about 30 rows back.  Like, you know, Radio City goes pretty far back.  Yeah, you had a nice seat, man.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, they were decent seats.  So, yeah, you know, show starts.  Everything's fine.  Who warmed up?  I don't know.  We didn't go to the...  The Tetley Five?  Yeah.  Fair enough.  So everyone's excited. 
[01:44:30]  Jack White hits the stage.  Everyone's excited.  Jack White hits the stage.  Plays a couple songs.  Then he says something like, Jesus Christ, what is this, an NPR convention?  You know, kind of commenting that the crowd's not as into it as he would like.  Oh, boy.  What songs did he play before that?  He played a couple White Stripes songs, but, like, not popular.  Dead Leaves?  He played Dead Leaves later on.  It was a retooled, kind of like, piano version.  Which is good.  That's all right. 
[01:45:00]  It'll be so wild, but...  Yeah, you know, he plays some White Stripes songs.  He plays some Dead Weather songs.  He plays some Raconteur songs.  He plays some White Stripes songs.  So I guess he wasn't really feeling the crowd.  The crowd was okay.  The crowd wasn't great, but they weren't, like...  Yeah, it happens.  But was his performance lacking?  It's...  I've seen him before.  It's not as good as I had seen him.  What's the problem?  I don't know.  I mean, but, you know, Sam saw him a couple months ago.  He puts on a hell of a show.  Radio City is a weird venue for him. 
[01:45:30]  Because, like, he doesn't do shows where people can sit down in the front row.  But nobody's sitting.  I mean, maybe people were sitting in the front row, but, like, nobody was sitting where I was.  Like, everybody stands up.  Yeah, but it's always weird when you have those chairs around, because you can't move.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, I hate going to see any rock show at, like, Radio City.  I get that everyone's standing, but you're still confined to your seat area.  Sure.  And that's a little weird for a rock vibe, I think.  So, yeah, he made that, like, you know, I'm a little annoyed, like, you know, what is  this, an NPR convention comment?  And then, like...  Then a couple songs later, like, afterwards, right before he played Dead Leaves, he sat down 
[01:46:00]  at the piano.  He's like, oh, quiet down, everyone.  Quiet down.  Jeez, you're too loud, you know?  So, you know...  He's a fucking baby.  That's another sarcastic comment.  Maybe the crowd did stink, too.  That happens.  But you know what?  You gotta finish the gig.  You just totally go.  You don't do fucking 45 minutes.  Just do an hour and 20.  Don't do two hours.  Do an hour and 20.  But you can't do 45 and walk off.  We interviewed him once.  He's, uh...  I wouldn't say he's a weird guy.  He was really strange.  A strange guy, yeah.  He's a weird rock star guy.  I know Sam loves him, but, you know... 
[01:46:30]  No, I love his music, too.  So do I?  That's why we all have tats of him on our arm.  So, you know, we all...  It's obvious we adore the man, but...  I was happy I wasn't at the show, because he's amazing live.  Except, I guess, for that one night.  And he was awesome when I met him.  He wasn't...  He was nice and friendly and happy.  Would you have been mad and just carved your fucking tat out of your arm like Maximus did  in Gladiator?  Apparently he played a great set last night at Radio City.  So, now, how did it go down?  So, he plays Ball and Biscuit, which is White Stripes. 
[01:47:00]  Nice, yeah.  Says something to the crowd.  I couldn't understand what he was saying, because it was very loud.  And then he left, and everybody thought, alright, well, Encore's coming in a couple minutes,  you know, and...  It'll be long.  He should be forced to give that money back.  People should demand that money back.  If he did a way shorter show than the night before, they should clamor for the money back.  He played 12 songs.  He's averaging about 20 songs on the tour.  Yeah, so he fucked the fans.  He barely played half.  Yeah, he's averaging about 12 songs, man.  A lot of songs are short. 
[01:47:30]  That can't be more than 40 minutes.  It was a 50, 55-minute show.  It was?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty fucking short.  Yeah.  Do an extra half hour, you're done.  You know who plays 50-minute shows?  Bands that just came out and have one album.  Katy Perry?  Did I tell you how long of you were speaking?  Did you play 70 shows?  That's 12 fucking Jack White shows.  Four hours.  Yeah, exactly.  Jack White's got close to 10 albums to draw from.  Which he does. 
[01:48:00]  He also does Dead Weather songs and he also does raconteur songs.  I saw your picture that you Instagrammed.  That was a great picture.  Which was, well, not quite as great as my good friend, Carly Folks, who was also there.  She was there as well.  That's right.  She had the same view, only a fuck of a lot closer.  Yeah, she was like in the fifth row.  She's my good friend, the T-Mobile girl.  Oh, the T-Mobile girl.  She's single.  She's on Instagram.  She's got a boyfriend.  I'm waiting that one out.  That picture's after the show. 
[01:48:30]  You guys talk a little bit here and there?  Oh, we've been known to, you know, a little chit-chat.  That's for sure.  So when he didn't come back, how did the crowd react?  How did it go to the point where I heard rumors people were going to riot?  You know, you kind of felt that there was going to be a little hipster riot there.  About five minutes after, you know, nothing was happening, the house lights came up and  music started playing.  And I've been to enough concerts where I know that's the show.  That's it.  Like, that's it.  He's not coming back out. 
[01:49:00]  But they didn't draw the curtains down, so everybody just stayed.  Everybody kept cheering.  Everybody kept, you know, trying to get him back out there.  About 20 minutes after he left the stage, they finally dropped that curtain.  Oh, shit.  They were probably asking him backstage, are you going to go on again?  That's what I'm thinking.  You know, if someone was talking, I'm like, look, man, come on.  We've got to do it.  Nope.  Nope.  I don't like the crowd.  Nope.  Nope.  Fucking cunty rock star.  What a cunt.  If he was like, you know, the sound sucks, we're not going to play anymore, then they 
[01:49:30]  would have said, show's over, guys.  Go home.  They wouldn't have waited 20 minutes to drop that curtain.  And then 10 minutes after they dropped that curtain, somebody finally had to come out  on stage, either a security guy or one of his people, and say, the show's over.  Go home.  All the doors, you know, the doors on the side of Radio City open up directly onto the street.  Yeah.  Those doors open up, and it was just booze, fuck Jack White, fuck him, people going to  the merch table and returning their merchandise.  Did they get their money back?  Yes.  They did? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Some people tweeted pictures of their refunded receipts.  Nice.  Did they get their money back for the show?  No.  No.  No.  For their merchandise.  Fucking cunty rock star.  Radio City music.  50 minutes at Radio City on a Saturday night.  That really fucking bugs me.  So what time did you leave?  Well, he came on at 9.12, and we probably left it.  Your Saturday night is done around 10, 10.15.  Yeah, well, we left it like 10, 10.45, I guess, because we stayed until...  Yeah, you were hanging open for something.  Yeah, because... 
[01:50:30]  Hey, I'm with Jimmy.  What a dick.  What a twat.  Absolutely, yeah.  People fucking work hard and, you know...  It sucked.  ...pay to see and you'd pull that shit.  Yeah, these weren't cheap tickets.  These went from, like, 50 to, like, $150.  That's what's so annoying, is the fact that people have to work really hard for that money.  And if you have a bad show, you have a bad show, but don't bail out like a little faggot  45 minutes into it.  You gotta suck it up.  I'm gonna go home.  You gotta suck it up.  Fucking jizz bag.  Give all that money back.  In retrospect, I'm really glad I was there, because it was an experience.  It was a happening. 
[01:51:00]  It was a happening.  And now, I told Danny in the back, I said, I didn't have an answer for what's the worst  show you've ever been to, and now I definitely have one.  Whoa.  Wow.  You know?  Damn it, it's gotta be fucking Sam's hero.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I like Jack White, too.  Not anymore.  I hate fucking rock stars that don't treat their...  Or anyone that doesn't treat their fans like that.  It was a very Axl Rose...  Another jerk-off move.  My worst show, Neil Young, when he didn't play any hits.  Oh, yeah, you didn't like that show.  Oh, my God.  And that annoyed me, just listening to you tell the story. 
[01:51:30]  I was fucking fuming.  I laughed so hard.  The guy...  But Neil Young, he fucking pulls that shit.  But I was so entertained by the guy behind me that just his excitement slowly, slowly went  away when he realized the chances of hearing a hit were fading quickly.  And he started going, this is bullshit, bullshit.  And then he was the guy, if you know the story, that finally stood up and said, hey, Neil,  how about one for us?  How about one for us?  I'll never forget that.  What a great line, though, to throw out there. 
[01:52:00]  This guy was gonna rip his seat out.  He was so mad.  But he was the guy...  He was the uber Neil Young fan that was sitting right behind me.  He was all...  Oh, he just wanted to get Cinnamon Girl and fucking...  Right.  And he gets these obscure, brand new fucking...  I forgot what it was now.  Noodling for his own pleasure shit up on stage.  But when they do that...  By my dumb point, we didn't know going into it that was the show.  I mean, if you're a fan of a band, they go, look, okay, we're gonna do something different.  Let's say it's Springsteen.  We're gonna play all B-tracks.  Are you cool with that? 
[01:52:30]  If you are...  Yeah, totally.  I know I'm on it anyway.  I'll be...  But tell us ahead of time so you go, you know what?  Yeah, I would go see all B-tracks, B-sides, whatever.  You know?  But when you're fucking blindsided like that...  Yeah, and the guy was so mad.  Hey, Neil, how about what for us?  No shit.  I heard he pulled the same thing in Central Park this weekend.  Of course he did.  Are you kidding me?  I don't know.  Yeah, I could have gone to that.  That was Saturday night.  I had tickets for that.  A couple people tweeted me in suits.  Ticket maven. 
[01:53:00]  Well, they were free.  A couple people tweeted me.  They said they were above average Neil Young fans, meaning they know a wide variety of  songs by him.  So he supposedly only played about two that most people would know.  I heard the Foo Fighters were very good.  Do you have tickets for them?  No, at Central Park.  They played at Central Park.  That annoys me so fucking much.  I've never seen anything like it.  I was standing there and these two girls behind us, they're like, do you think he's coming  back out?  I'm like, there's no possible way. 
[01:53:30]  And they said, shut up, creepy guy.  Yeah, exactly.  We don't like your beard.  You're weird.  Like, there's no possible way.  He's going to wait 45 minutes and then come back out after nearly, you know, the entire  crowd turning against him.  What do you know, Dr. Gay?  That's what they said.  My second worst concert, I'm being reminded because Brian on Long Island had the same experience.  And I like the guy, but Bob Dylan fucking blows in concert.  Doesn't acknowledge the crowd, looks down the entire fucking time. 
[01:54:00]  People are cheering.  He doesn't even acknowledge that you're fucking cheering for him.  And then he changes the arrangement of every fucking song to the point you don't know what  the song is anymore.  And then, of course, you don't understand his lyrics because he mumbles.  It was horrendous.  And I know that's going to piss off a lot of Bob Dylan people today, but I hate it.  He's just like, you know, he's like, I hated the Bob Dylan show.  That was in Rochester.  Like, fuck, that could be 20 years ago at this point.  Brian, go ahead.  Yeah, my friend got tickets. 
[01:54:30]  I really don't care for Bob Dylan too much, but he is Bob Dylan.  And it was at Jones Beach.  It was an awesome theater.  Perfect night.  And we go there, and I'm like, what do I expect?  He's Bob Dylan.  He did not play one song that anybody knows.  He plays, like, I don't know if it's new hits or just like, don't follow songs.  And then I didn't even understand what he was talking about because he  can't understand his lyrics.  I remember.  How about some, how does it feel?  How about some of that?  Well, I remember 10 minutes into Like a Rolling Stone, I went, oh, this is Like a Rolling Stone. 
[01:55:00]  Now it's, how do you think?  Daniel, you're facing on the Rolling Stone.  How do you think?  What the fuck?  He stinks.  That's like eight songs we were saying, if the next one we don't know, we're leaving.  And we did that like nine times.  And he called Dylan, I was very respectful, and then we were just like, we're out of here.  This fucking bloat.  And then how about the one no one even knows?  It's him.  Lee, Lee, Lee.  Lee across my big brass beard.  It's like, wait, that's Dylan? 
[01:55:30]  For the longest, thank you, sir.  For the longest time, I was with you.  I had no idea.  Be with you, man.  Wow.  Dylan's off.  Do you think more people in me and Sam's generation know Bob Dylan for Bob Dylan or for Soy Bomb?  Soy Bomb.  Good old Soy Bomb.  Soy Bomb is a man.  Soy Bomb.  Oh, that sucks.  Yeah, it did suck.  Yeah, it's disappointing because I know how good he is live.  Supposedly the Foo Fighters broke up too, right?  Well, they were playing a Central Park concert as well.  Yeah.  And he said, you know, he said something to the effect of this is the last time we're going to play together for a while. 
[01:56:00]  So whatever that means, it sounds very non-committal.  I think they're taking a very extended break.  He must be a prick to work with.  Grohl?  Oh, I thought you meant fucking Jack White.  Yeah.  But he must be a prick to work with Jack White.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  But Dave Grohl?  No, Dave Grohl seems like Grohl.  Dave Grohl seems awesome.  I'm sorry, you were talking.  I wasn't paying attention.  You know, that's not nice.  I'm right here.  Oh, next to you.  Oh, hi, Travis.  Jack White is a perfectionist, but he's a twat. 
[01:56:30]  He's probably a brilliant musician, but enough of the genius moniker.  He's a cunt.  If you walk off after 50 minutes and fuck your fans like that, you're a cunt.  And you got no respect for the fact they spent that kind of money to come see you.  None.  That drives me nuts.  If he had a bad show, believe me, I've seen Ozzy when he was not at his best.  But he never walked off like a fucking cocksucker.  I've seen his voice shot.  Finish the fucking show.  Finish the fucking show, baby.  I saw Courtney Love about 10 years ago.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:57:00]  Sorry.  And she lost her voice in the second song, and she played for an hour and a half.  I bet Ozzy tried, and Sharon just kicked him back onto the stage.  Yeah.  From side stage, she's got to chase him.  No.  Yeah, you saw a shoe on his ass the entire time.  Yeah, just pushing him back out.  Any band you want to mention, as a performer, you'd think I've never had a fucking crowd,  and I was like, ugh.  I didn't love Cincinnati last time I went.  I wanted to walk off to eight minutes one of this.  Wow.  Can't do it.  Gotta go.  Fucking use all the years you've been performing.  Put together a decent set, whether it's a crowd or it's you. 
[01:57:30]  Sometimes you walk off and you go, the only thing that salvaged that was the fact that  I've been doing this for 20 years.  Wow.  And I know how to fucking, it's like you know how to do smoke and mirrors and put together  a good show.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, you know how to make it.  People go, all right, that was cool.  But to walk off after fucking, it makes me crazy.  It does, right?  I was telling Travis, there's also very bad timing, because the same morning that this  news breaks of, you know, the fans almost rioting because Jack White walked off, Justin  Bieber was in concert that same night, and he threw, Justin Bieber threw up on the stage 
[01:58:00]  because he had like a flu or something.  Oh, yeah, sure, the flu.  And he kept performing.  And it's like if Justin Bieber is now out rock starring you.  Oh, God.  How's that video, by the way?  I saw that clip.  I don't understand why the Biebs didn't just walk back in where he came out on stage.  Like, he bends over like that.  Why doesn't he just walk?  Look how long it's taken him to puke.  Wow.  How would have fans were scrambling to eat it up? 
[01:58:30]  Oh, wow.  You know, one would have easily.  Yeah, because he wanted everyone to notice that he was puking.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's one of those.  Oh, no.  Puking's a weird thing, dude.  That's a fucking horrible.  I respect him more, though, for continuing to play.  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  Shot him just bent over like that.  Puking.  Yeah.  All right, good for the Biebs.  Better than Jack White.  So here's the Foo Fighters announcement.  Mm-hmm.  They've been out a long time.  What, you think they're going to take a year or two off?  Yeah.  I guess. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, they could.  Why not?  Without making a big deal out of it, we don't have any shows after this.  This is it, man.  We don't have any ones after this.  This is the show where we come out and we play as many songs as we can in a short period  of time.  Because honestly, I don't know when we're going to do it again.  And this is the perfect place to do it right now, tonight.  You know what I mean?  What's that about?  That was very vague.  I think he just wants to take some time off. 
[01:59:30]  But that's a little dramatic.  They want people to think they might be breaking up?  That was in the E-Rock category of vagueness.  Yeah.  Did you see the show?  Yeah.  What?  Did you see the show?  Hey.  At the end of the show, he said, like, I don't know when, but we'll see you soon.  They'll be back.  Because they're up in that category now of, like, you know, one of the biggest rock bands.  And they're starting to do that whole play three hours long, play three and a half hours  long sets.  You mean they don't walk off at their 50 minutes?  No.  Their sets are longer than Dexter's premiere last night. 
[02:00:00]  How long was that?  An hour.  Oh, oh, oh.  He scared me.  Like, Dexter was, like, 14 minutes.  How was it?  It was great.  It was really good.  People loved Dexter?  You should really watch that show.  No, I should.  I hope he only killed bad guys.  You have to get past it.  I can't get past it.  I'm sure he's a great actor.  It's not about the acting.  You've got to think that's going to be a twist eventually.  We're like, oh, fuck.  I thought this guy only killed bad guys.  It's a great show.  I don't like when a show is so set up for me because the fucking people who designed 
[02:00:30]  it went to likability 101 school.  We have to make the character likeable.  Drives me fucking crazy.  I hate when they go for the dramatic death and then, you know, next season they figure  out a way out of it.  I hate that shit.  The cancer show with the fucking father there dropping dead as the cancer woman is running  the fucking marathon.  The big C.  The big C.  And then it turns out, oh, no, he just had a heart attack and he's recovering at home 
[02:01:00]  now.  He's okay.  Just a couple years ago.  Spoiler alert.  But it was so dramatic because you're focused on the woman with the cancer is going to die  and then it turns out, no, he dies.  It's lazy writing.  And that's how they handled it at the end of that season.  He's dead.  But then they're like, well, all right, we'll just sit on it and then make, you know, we'll  have him come back.  It was just a heart attack.  It's a fucking commit, man.  Go all in.  Can we play Dead Leaves?  That's a great song.  Yeah.  I love Dead Leaves.  It is a great song.  There's so many great songs. 
[02:01:30]  What's our slogan today?  I can't even remember.  Oh, wait, we feed your need for rock.  Yeah.  Who feeds your need for rock?  We're going to feed your...  Who feeds e-rock?  What?  We're going to feed your need for rock right now with a little White Stripes, Dead Leaves.  It's a short song.  And then Jacktober when we return.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  Dead Leaves, Dead Leaves.  I can't even remember.  Dead Leaves.  Dead Leaves.  I can't even remember.  Off the line.  There you go.  Yeah.  Dead leaves and the dirty ground 
[02:02:30]  When I know you're not around  Shiny tops and soda bars  When I hear lips make a sound  When I hear lips make a sound  $30 in the mailbox  When I tell you that I'm coming home  And I think I'm going to stick around  For a while so you're not alone  For a while so you're not alone  If you can hear a piano fall 
[02:03:00]  You can hear me coming down the hall  If I could just hear your prettier voice  I don't think I need to see it at all  Don't think I need to see it at all  Soft hair and a velvet tongue 
[02:03:30]  I want to give you what you give to me  And every breath that is in your lungs  Is a tiny little gift to me  It's a tiny little gift to me  I didn't feel so bad for the sun went down 
[02:04:00]  Then I come home  And I want to run my arms around  When my arms are around  When any man with a microphone  Can tell you what he loves the most  And you know why you love it at all  If you're thinking of the Holy Ghost  If you're thinking of the Holy Ghost 
[02:04:30]  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  Yeah, this is the O.P. Anthony Show  We're going to wrap up Joctober for today  Yeah 
[02:05:00]  We're featuring a show out of Canada  Oh, terrible  The Bullpen with Bruffer, Mack, and Kayfell  On 94.5 The Bull  It is, so far has been horrible  With all the features  The whole, the old radio veteran  And the wild guy is kind of  He's out there, yells a lot  I don't find it to be bad  I find it to, it's like  Because it's about time there's a mix of things  You know what I mean? 
[02:05:30]  You have to realize  Oh, yeah, yeah  There's a lot of people out there  And you can have a little bit of craziness  With a guy like Kayfell  Some just solid humor  With a guy like Bruffer  Right  And then Mack is there to make sure  That everybody kind of stays together  Doesn't get too crazy  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Because you don't want that  So it's a perfect balance, huh?  Yeah, because fun is fun  I don't like a show that gets crazy like that  I like that she's there to keep that from happening  It's something most broadcasters don't realize  Is fun is fun, but only to an extent  Right  Well, you don't want it to go too far 
[02:06:00]  Because then they have the audience  I like a ladies' point of view  Oh, yeah  Because a lot of times the ladies will bring it back down  We get carried away  Right, like I didn't think about it from that perspective  Type of thing  Right, guys  And that's why this is a valuable show  To listen to  Right  Like, I enjoy it more than this one, personally  Yeah, I think it's good natured  And it's just that, you know  People can listen to it with the kids around  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  Thank God Mack is there to go  Come on now  You can put it on in the stores  Sure  That's why I brought this to the table  I feel like you guys get a little nasty sometimes 
[02:06:30]  And maybe listening  A little blue  We work blue sometimes  Listening to the bullpen would make you think  Oh, maybe I should adjust my broadcasting style  It's the talent to be able to do it within the guidelines  That's exactly right  That's exactly right  That's the problem with satellite radio  Not enough restrictions  On a side note  Is Jennifer Hutt pissed?  Oh, boy  Are you going to have the exclusive interview at 10 o'clock?  She said she'd come on the after show  Oh, yeah  What is she doing now?  She's here stalking Chelsea Handler  Because she's doing Howard's show 
[02:07:00]  So I guess she's going to  I don't know  What's going to pick or something?  I don't know  We can't get her anymore  We tried  We tried  Wrong  Because I tried  I tried  I tried  I tried  I wonder, too, if Howard's people are being more territorial  Because he's only on a few days  Of course they are  Like, almost  Of course  Because there's not as many live shows  Right  So to keep that show feeling special  Like, when we get somebody  We keep them exclusive to us  Because what else differentiates it? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, that could be  I mean, this is a guess  Have fun playing that stupid game  It's 2012  I want the guess thing  It's enough for me  I know  Anyway, let's get back to Jocktober  The bullpen with Bruffer, Mack, and K-Fell  On 94.5  The bull  It's the bullpen's casting couch  Really?  What's this about, Sam?  Uh-oh, that sounds risque  Yeah, it is a little risque  What they do is  They go on PrepBurger  And they find wacky news stories  Wait  Their whole show is PrepBurger  My God, man 
[02:08:00]  Except these wacky news stories  Refer to celebrities  So it's a celebrity  Wacky news stories from PrepBurger  You sure it's on PrepBurger?  Yep  Did I say that?  No, they don't announce that  But the fact that, you know  If you listen to any number of shows  On a given day  And they're covering these same stories  It's because they're PrepBurger  You can tell  Especially, I mean  Let's be honest  Why do they call it PrepBurger?  That I don't know  Because you prepare a burger  A burger  And the morning show itself is the burger 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, you're serving it up to the people every morning  This is the fifth year of October  And every burger is different  But it's how you prepare it  God, maybe that's it  I'm trying to figure out  Why they would call their service the PrepBurger  Some are well done  Others are a bit rare  Oh  Can we see the PrepBurger?  Can we bring it up?  I can't because I don't have a username and all that stuff  Why?  We have nobody that belongs to PrepBurger?  I don't know  We did last year or something  I've talked about it  Not for our show, by the way, assholes  How much is it to join?  Don't spin that shit  Yeah, right? 
[02:09:00]  I don't know  I'm going to see if I can get a membership this year  Let's join it  Let's join it by tomorrow  Because we could mock it  And go on and hear other radio shows  I would love to get a bunch of radio shows  Everyone's wild  We could mock PrepBurger  After October's long gone  Yeah  Alright, here we go  The Bullpen's casting couch  Right now at the Bull  Because nobody's a true star  Until they've been on the Bullpen's casting couch  Here's what the who's who idiots in Hollywood are up to today  Well, I don't know if this is good news or bad news  But it might be ugly 
[02:09:30]  Not one, but two sex tapes are out there for Kanye to worry about right now  According to TMZ  They say that the tape we heard about yesterday featuring Kanye  Getting it on  Getting it on  With Kim Kardashian  Or a Kim Kardashian look-alike  Isn't the only one being shopped around  The second tape is said to be twice as long  Lasting 40 minutes  And apparently that's non-stop action  I have a question for celebrities out there  Why do you insist on taping it when you're doing it?  Because they're used to being on camera  Oh, God  Yeah, that's a good one 
[02:10:00]  Because he's a tool  Why are you trying for a real answer there?  Right, yeah  She comes back with the facts  That's what she's there for  That's not why they do it  Yeah  They want to jerk off to it later  Silly  Come on  For celebrities out there  Why do you insist on taping it when you're doing it?  Because they're used to being on camera  Have you ever starred in a sex tape, K-Fell?  No  No, me either  I'd be way too embarrassed for that  No girl wants to show anyone that they were with me  Aw, come on 
[02:10:30]  You're much too hard on yourself  Stop it  Oh, hard on  Was that a hard on joke?  That's a hard on joke  You can hear him go, huh-huh  But he knew  He knew better than to delve into that  But even more importantly  Did you hear Mac's response to the joke?  Uh-oh  Because we were so busy processing  Go to the end of the clip  Hard on  All right  Because if you're  If you're spending time processing  Anyone that they were with me  Aw, come on  You're much too hard on yourself  Stop it 
[02:11:00]  Oh, stop it  Oh, God  Stop it  Oh, God  Oh, stop it  That's why I'm here  It's time to stop this  Right now  Was she really offended by that?  Was she able to be like  Oh, stop it  Or does she just take miles a dick  And has to make believe  That she's offended  It's just a world out there  We don't understand  That's how people fucking live their lives  Oh, God  We know hard on can refer to  Erections  Whoa  Oh, is that what they do? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah  Oh, see, I didn't know  Right  So she's kind of like  Whoa, whoa  Before this goes nuts  Rumor has it  The Facebook page is not happening right now  Hey  There's a rumor  A little rumor going on  And the Facebook page is down  It's gone  The Facebook page  What do you mean it's down?  Why would they do that?  94.5  The bull  Yeah  The bullpen  Yeah  Does not have a Facebook page  Oh, we've reached that level  You go to this link right here  Right  It's the bullpen on Facebook 
[02:12:00]  Yeah  Right  That's something I just clicked on  A couple minutes ago  Yeah, just click that right there  Just click that  And it goes right to the Facebook homepage  Oh  Oh  Which means  I'm so sorry  Oh, it's gone  Is there a Twitter?  I wanted to see if they're updating their Twitter  Yeah  They started their day  Like any other day  What's their Twitter?  A mere couple hours later  They're deleting their Facebook page  They have to fucking take their Facebook page offline  Hmm  I just want to read their tweets and see if they're Twittering  I don't know what their Twitter is  Yeah 
[02:12:30]  Does anybody know?  Oh  I don't know  They should have tweeters  I didn't think so  What's the morning mooch?  Oh, the morning mooch  We're almost done with today's Jacktober  The morning mooch is where  It's a good kickoff too  Where you can  The listeners  Are mooching  Off the show hosts  Meaning  They call in  And get a prize  What?  Yep  They just  I mean it's another  Call in for a prize thing  But this time  Yeah  The morning mooch  Involves the theater of the mind 
[02:13:00]  Less  Ah  The theater of the mind  Less  Whoa  Oh boy  And what happens there is  Two members of the show  Will read a movie scene  Like act it out together  And then they'll give lots of very obvious clues  Hoping that maybe one person might call  Oh wait  Is this true?  What's that?  There's an  At 95 the Bull  That would be a  95 the Bull Twitter  I don't know if that's the same stage 
[02:13:30]  Because this is 94.5  See?  What are you doing?

[02:14:30]  This son of a bitch  Asshole  Yeah  His tweet  He just writes  WWE is so bad  Oh well there's a problem now  If that doesn't warrant an attack  I don't know what does  Maybe he means good  Maybe  Maybe bad like good  Like Michael Jackson bad  94.5  The Bull is a pretty good Twitter account  They have 144 followers  Oh wow  Come on  What are you doing as a radio station  Oh my god  When you can promote it around the clock  What are you twittering?  Nothing but vomit photos?  Those would get more  I'm sure  And they're smart too

Well no the problem is  That you guys might think  There's no way it could possibly  But it is  You just now  Is it Slapshot?  They read two lines from a movie 
[02:17:00]  What happened?  And then the listeners call up  And name the movie  Oh what is the line again?  I didn't realize  It's two lines from a movie  That's right  There's not many hockey movies though  Is it Slapshot?  And then this is the part  Where they start giving away  Very obvious clues  Why would they all say that?  Because they can't play  So I think maybe it has something  To do with hockey  Dice  What do you think?  1-877-794-5  Why would he give away that?  Come on  I'm so mad right now  Dice 
[02:17:30]  It was vague enough  Let me walk people through this  It was vague enough  Where it's like  Okay you gotta think sports movies  But then he goes  Oh it has something to do with hockey  There was nothing in there  That says that it's actually hockey  No  And there's literally like  One hockey movie  I thought it was  I thought it was the accused  Slapshot or the Mighty Ducks  I think  That's about it  And then instead of  Keeping the mystery alive  It's saying  I don't know  KFL goes  It does  Who here is it does again?  They can't play  So I think maybe it has something 
[02:18:00]  To do with hockey  Dice  What do you think?  1-877-794-5  1-877-945-2855  Propel to sell at  2855 toll free  Do that again guys  Alright  Alright  Every ex-player turned coach  Says they prefer coaching  Over playing  Why would they all say that?  Because they can't play  That's not  I think there's a reference to a  That's not obviously hockey  No  Not at all  Why did you just take the seventh caller?  Because they realize  That nobody would ever call in for that  That's true 
[02:18:30]  Because nobody would possibly know  What with 144 fucking Twitter followers  It's very  There's such few listeners  That you know  Out of that pool  To know what that line is from  It's impossible  It does  He was so excited  It's terrible  They all know the answer  It's the worst does ever  Does  Does  I think there's a reference to a walrus in this movie  Oh I know it  I know the movie  Sorry in advance  It's the Eric Nagel story

Uh 945 to go  Why?  What's wrong with their phones?  There's nothing wrong with their phones  There's something wrong with the pre-recording they did of that phone call 
[02:23:00]  The audio is obviously fucked up  But they realize that they're not going to get another caller any way in hell  So they're like well we just got to play it  Why do you have to say who feeds your need for rock and she answers?  You guys killed  Because the PD fucking hammers that in your head  You get the slug line out there  Make sure  We've done slug lines in the past  Oh yeah  You know  They're terrible  They're not perfect  Feed your need for rock  We did work at the only station that really rocks  So  Yeah but they didn't feed any  You didn't feed anybody's need for rock  No we don't even feed people's need for laughter or entertainment 
[02:23:30]  I think we might have asked the question  What's the only station that really rocks though  Uh huh  And there we go  Yeah  AAF  AAF  Yeah  But AAF doesn't feed my need  And I read they feed your need for rocks  Yeah  When you're homo  And if you're looking for a good hockey movie  The Goon is a great one  Oh there you are  With Sean William Scott who came in and promoted that movie  Uh oh  Norm says get ready

[02:25:00]  Suicide live  You got any of those calls from the bullpen or  They were waiting  I don't see  That was one of their listeners on Fox  Oh the show  Kingston Pete  He's a regular on the Twitter  He writes  The bull is in  Wingham, Ontario  If that makes sense to people  Yep  Population  2,923 people  What?  I live four hours from this town  And just learned it existed today  Wow you went deep for 
[02:25:30]  Fucking  In Jocktober  This was a listener suggestion  You went deep  I thought it was important to highlight the bullpen  That's a tiny little radio station  It's market number 500 in Ontario  That's the beauty of Jocktober  No matter how far tucked away you are  Oh you're never safe  You will be attacked  Yes  You're never safe  You don't think shows enjoy when they're featured?  I think it could possibly be the worst thing  For some of them the worst thing in their careers  Because they're just not used to being made fun of 
[02:26:00]  No  At all  Like they're used to being this little show  That you know  Half a dozen people listen to and like  Half a dozen  And the rest of  The rest of everybody else  Just leaves them alone  Six people are listening  Yeah  But he says it like it's absolutely a fact  Yeah  I checked into it  No it's six people  Half a dozen  Half a dozen  They're not used to like severe criticism  Right  And be snorting  And so when there's like you know  Hundreds to thousands of people  Just attacking them for no reason 
[02:26:30]  They did nothing  Yeah  They don't know how to cope  You think they'll spin it in a good way?  Like hey  Any kind of publicity  Yeah  This is good for us  I hope we end up in Canadian newspapers  Oh yeah  That'd be nice  A little press  In honor of Jocktober  I could  Put some focus on me  What happened with you?  Someone tweeted me something  Over the weekend  And I was by myself  When I pushed play  And I was completely embarrassed

[02:30:30]  Put that on the Facebook page  There we rock  All right  See  My crutch is that I say  Anti-disestablishmentarianism too much  Did you see there's a Halloween store  In our neighborhood?  Yeah  That joint just stays there  With nothing in it  For a year  And then it opens up  Once a year  They've got to make all their money  Well  Yeah  Because no one else is renting the space 
[02:31:00]  Yeah  So the Halloween people  Rent it every year  I'm opening a Halloween store  Oh  Ted  Ted  I bet you it's some kind of emporium  Yes it is Gregory  It's Ted's Spooky Oaky Goblins and Ghouls Halloween Emporium  Spooky Oaky  Yes it is Anthony  Is that it?  I open it on October 31st at 8.30pm  Well that's kind of not smart  People wait to get their Halloween needs  How many costumes do you sell?  I have about 40,000 for sale 
[02:31:30]  And how many have you actually sold?  Six  Well they were actually stolen off the truck  Don't you think it's a little late  Like people already have their costumes  No at 8.30 on Halloween night  They're going to start rolling in  To purchase their goodies  You should open it up now Ted  No I don't want to  Regist to I Gregory  I open it that night  And I keep it open until December 4th  Why do you do that?  This way it's on Halloween  People can go  Let's go get our goodies 
[02:32:00]  No let's do it at 8.30pm  That's when they're out there already trick or treating  No I have bushels of candy to sell too  Yeah what kind of candy do you sell?  I sell only Malamars  That's a cookie isn't it?  Throw it in the bag  So melty  Oh well what kind of costumes are we looking at over there?  What's your best sellers?  Oh I have  I have their Superman  I have a cape actually 
[02:32:30]  Like you say you can be a Superman with this cape  And I have a wig  That's safe and a wig?  20,000 of each  That would be the worst store ever  That was wonderful  You could be the cape twig crusader  Is it a different color wigs or?  No it's just black and a red cape  And Malamars  I don't think this business is going to do very well 
[02:33:00]  Can't people go get free candy at 8.30pm on Halloween night?  No but you should buy it and go home and give it out to all the children  It will make you feel wonderful Samuel  By the time you get home  It'll probably be 10pm  It's only me working  And I'm expecting a long line  It's on the 35th floor of a building  Wow  So no one knows you're there if they're just walking down the street  Yes I'm afraid of Mariah Gregory  So I'm trying to keep it under my hat  Or a wig as it were  LOL  Wig as it were 
[02:33:30]  Wig as it were  Wig as it were  Oh my god  Oh boy  So we got the suicide on Fox News?  Yes  Some guy  It was one of these car chases  We've seen them all before  Sure  And they usually  You know you're very excited  You're waiting for something to happen  And nothing happens  Well this time something definitely  It's the first time anything really good happened  I know  Why do you dislike a suicide video on YouTube? 
[02:34:00]  People just have to be just dicks right?  Is that what that's about?  I think so yeah  It gets ridiculous after a while  How would you dislike that?  What needed to be better in this video?  Yeah  You already know it's a suicide video  Because it says it in the title  Right?  Exactly  So what did the guy do wrong?  That you had to dislike this?  Right?  You shouldn't show that on the intranet  I want to know why he killed himself  Because you know car chase sure  They were closing in  He was going to get arrested 
[02:34:30]  But he wasn't going to do that much time in the end right?  Tell you what his warrant was  He might have had a warrant  Maybe he had something big  Why don't we know anything about the guy yet?  I don't know  Keeping it all in the QT  I could watch this  It wasn't close up  I probably could watch this close up  We saw the Bud Dwyer  That's the most famous  Oh yeah that's crazy  Most famous live suicide ever  This  Want to play it over there or over here?  It's up to you  Yeah I'll play it over there  So we can watch it too  Car chase  Full screen  Can we put this on our Facebook page?  Because people were telling me all weekend  They had a tough time  Finding this video 
[02:35:00]  We could but they may take it down  And I certainly tweeted this fucking video for everybody  If this is on YouTube  This one  Yeah  I bet  I bet the actual shooting is blacked out  I bet they faded out  You think?  I bet  Okay  Let's find out  Okay  We're just  He is looking kind of erratic  Isn't he?  Yes  Um  Shepard Smith  I don't know  He's got a gun in his hand  No  And look at this  He's just running 
[02:35:30]  Oh my  Well it looks like he's a little disoriented or something  It's always possible God could be on something  Um  Oh  There it is  Oh they showed it  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  Get off  You should have shown that  You want to show the car chases  Right  Why would  You're the news  Why would you cut out  Yeah  Why are you showing the car accident  I mean the car chasing 
[02:36:00]  Yeah  They show you  Zipping 100 miles an hour through traffic  And yet all of a sudden  If somebody dies  We can't show that  Well  It's the phoniest fucking thing I've ever seen  It's completely phony  They knew that they were going to air that  Yeah  You know there's no other reason to show car chases  Because us as viewers  We're looking at the car chase  Hoping that something crazy  Right  Fucking happens  Right  You gotta have the pay  Sure  Absolutely  That's the news  I guess the action is the news  But if somebody shoots themselves  It's not viable news  Right  You showed the fucking towers coming down enough times  Right  Yeah  What is this a little too close to what really happens 
[02:36:30]  And then they did the old apology  Wow  The fake apology  Yeah  Yeah  Shep  Well  Some explaining to do  While we were taking that car chase  And showing it to you live  When the guy pulled over  And got out of the vehicle  We went on delay  So that's why I didn't talk for about 10 seconds  We created a five second delay  As if you were to bleep back your DVR five seconds 
[02:37:00]  That's what we did with the picture we were showing you  So that we would see in the studio  What was happening five seconds before you did  So that if anything went horribly wrong  You'd be able to cut away from it  No way  Without subjecting you to it  No  See  And we really messed up  But why  And we're all very sorry  No you didn't mess up  That didn't belong on TV  Yes it did  We took every precaution  We knew how to take  To keep that from being on TV  The guy is lying  You know how long five seconds is in TV and radio 
[02:37:30]  He's lying  So everyone knew like  Okay we can allow this to happen  But we have to cover our ass  He's seasoned  He knows this shit  So it's his whole job to be like  No no no no no  We can't do this  We can't do this  Get off it  Get off it  Get off it  Get off it  There's so many lies here  But again it's like  They're so selected  They did not  No one cut away  Why did they cut away when the towers fell  Yeah  Why are they showing a plane  Right  When a plane's got a problem  Boy the fucking news can't show that long enough  Right  That it might crash  Right  But if it crashes  Then you're going to come off it 
[02:38:00]  Right  Get the fuck out of here  We apologize for showing you that  They had every intention of showing it  And they needed Shepard Smith to play his role of  No no no  We can't show this  I'm sorry I did that  Five seconds to get off it  That's an eternity  Yeah  It's so phony  Of course it is  Show it  Hey why are you sorry  People sat through the car crash  They get what they deserve  Well the phoniness is the apology thing  Yeah  Because they knew they were going to show this  There's no way  Car chase I meant  Yeah  Precaution we knew how to take 
[02:38:30]  To keep that from being on TV  And I personally apologize to you  That that happened  Sometimes  We see a lot of things  That we don't let get to you  Because it's not time appropriate  It's insensitive  It's just wrong  And that was wrong  Shut up  Yeah but you don't believe this  And that won't happen again on my watch  Oh  Shut the fuck up  What happened with that guy  And how that went down  Too bad  Tonight on the Fox Report  Oh see and then they tease it 
[02:39:00]  Yeah yeah  Now they're using it to tease  Find out what happened to him  Tonight on the Fox Report  Yeah yeah  Fucking  They're just phonies  Yeah they show embassy bombings  Everything else is okay  They'll show another one  Can't show it a little too close up  Nope  We want to talk about it  I would love to know  How many people jerked off  That work at Fox News  When that went down  Yeah  We got a good one  I hate when they cut away  It means  It's like  You're encouraging people  By showing the car chase  Then don't show the car chase  How about this 
[02:39:30]  Don't cut into regular programming  To fucking whore a car chase  Right  Yeah  Don't do that  And I might have messed up  Over the weekend  I had good intentions  Everyone was searching for that video  Because it was being yanked off the internet  And I had a copy of it  And I tweeted  Here's the video of the live suicide  And then I tweeted the wrong link  It ended up being the link  To my basketball shot video  Oh see  The Oapster was hoping for some views  Sam do you just laugh at that 
[02:40:00]  The Oapster's at it again  He's trying  People were so pissed  Hook, line, and sinker  Like alright here it is  I have it  People always forget  The link to my stupid fucking  Basketball trick shot video  The Oapster's always got a trick up  Oh boy were they mad  Boy were they mad  The Oapster's always got a new scam  Or swindle to get some more viewers on YouTube  Look I meant well  I meant well  I didn't mean well on that  I got confused  I was working on my YouTube channel 
[02:40:30]  And you know  Link's got confused  A little bit  A little bit Sam  A little bit  They hated me  Oh no doubt  And you had a good tweet about this  It made a Reddit  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  It made a Reddit  What's the actual tweet  You made the front page of Reddit  Well  I don't want to paraphrase  There's Samuel  Go to  At Anthony Coombe  Yeah come on  What's the matter with you  What's the matter with you  No it did real well on Reddit 
[02:41:00]  Reddit's a great site  Oh yeah  You gotta go back  8,000 fucking tweets  You know  I tweet a lot  And I  Watched your helicopter video  I felt like I was in a hotel room  It was very tranquil  I felt like I was going on a journey  Very tranquil  I felt like I was going on a journey  And then I didn't realize  You liked Duran Duran  Who doesn't like Duran Duran  But you went with a slow number  For your helicopter video  Yeah I just picked anything 
[02:41:30]  It was very tranquil  To drown out the rotor noise  Yeah  But that one kind of  Kind of worked  Oh there it is  I tweeted  Remember when Fox showed a guy  Shooting himself on live TV  If that was a nipple  We'd still be talking about  How to protect the children  When a tit ends up on television  People lose their motherfucking minds  And believe me  I have no qualms about  Any of this being on TV 
[02:42:00]  I'm not saying one is better  Or worse than the other  I love everything on there  Please bring it  Bring girls with their tits  Hanging out shooting themselves  I'll watch  But it's just amazing  That people are so up in arms  About sex  And fucking the body  Being on TV  And there's a guy  Shooting himself in the head  And they apologize  You know  Said it was a mistake  But there's no  No one's freaking out  That the children  Are gonna  My children  Were watching  I want 
[02:42:30]  I want all of it on TV as well  But I'll give you  The father's perspective  I would much rather  My kid sees a stupid nipple  For half a second  Than a guy killing himself  Right  Because then you gotta  Explain all that shit  Because they always talk  About the children  Like we've said  A million times in the show  The children  In my world  Nah man  Show the nipples  I don't care  I could explain that to my kid  It really is amazing though  That's the thinking  Actually I would explain  Bolt to my kid  But I think he would be  A little more horrified by that  Than a dumb nipple  Yeah  Then you gotta explain  Why he would do something like that 
[02:43:00]  And where did he go  And why there's no Santa  Oh sorry kids  Sorry  My tweet did not make ready  Oh  What was yours Jimmy  It's not worth it  Jimmy  Jimmy what was it  No we really  He gotta talk him  He wants us to talk him into it  It's so creepy  Nah no  I can't  Alright  If you insist  Alright  We didn't really insist yet  Jimmy  He grabs his phone  He's like alright  We were working up  To the insistent 
[02:43:30]  Alright  You gotta give us all time  I have to act like I'm scrolling  And it's not open to my tweet already  That's my fake scroll  For some movement  What was your tweet  I'm embarrassed now  Fox News aired  Fox News aired  Live suicide the other day  First time I ever  Turned on the TV  Hoping to see Al Sharpton  That's a good one  See  That is good  Did it make Reddit  No  Did it make any sites  That's a shame 
[02:44:00]  Made my Twitter  Made your Twitter feed  Yes  Twitter  I'm gonna piss my pants  Twitter  We should break then  Because we got Todd coming in  I haven't seen Todd in a while  Todd Roskin  Todd Roskin is a weird dude  Yes he is  I like him though  I love Todd  Don't get confused  He's weird  But I like him a lot  He's one of Dice's guys  And he has this 15 minute film  On Russ Meyers  It's in the New York  Or Russ Meier  Russ Meier I think  Meier right  Russ Meier

[02:49:00]  I think maybe because  We met in Los Angeles  And I  We happened to have been like  We grew up in the same neighborhood  We're born in the same hospital  In Brooklyn, New York  Which is kind of weird  It's such a strange coincidence  That you meet someone in Los Angeles  And you end up having like such a  Maybe like a connection  You know  That type of a connection  I think it was like  Yeah strange  It was like  Even  Maybe I think  Same doctor  Delivered 
[02:49:30]  I don't know  It was a weird thing  A strange coincidence  What year was it that I knew you from  Because you always come to  On the road  We were on the road together for a while  You know  I'm horrible years  2000 or 99  Around there right  About 2000  2001  Yeah  About 2000  2001  That's right  Wow  I know it's had a long time  And I like the movie a lot  What's it called  Up the Valley and Beyond  Yeah we like Russ Meyer  We're all fans of Russ Meyer here  Oh that's  I can't get enough of Mondo Topless  That's my movie  That's an amazing movie  It's  Why is it amazing to you  Because to me

[02:50:30]  Technically  It's  It's like an industrial film  Like you know  You could do industrial films  On IBM  Or industrial films  On GM  Or whatever it is  He's doing it on breasts  And it's just silly  With a narrator  And then like  You know  And then there's like  These women doing this  Narration  Voice over  And these strange shots  Crazy juxtapositions  But it was sexy  Really in front of the train  As it's going by  The girl with an awful radio  And the train  But it was fucking sexy  And the announcer  Brings it all together  Like you said  What's his name again 
[02:51:00]  We used to know his name  He died recently  A couple years back  He had  I don't know  You asked that in Jersey  Like who was his narrator  And I  He had the different narrators  I mean  Russ had done some  On his own  He'd narrate  But I think  Maybe  What is it  Stuart Lancaster  Maybe  I'm not sure  But just how he  You know  Described the women  He had his own way  It's like a free association  Bapette  Bapette  Bapette  Bapette  Bapette  Crazy words  And Russ himself  50-50  Where it counts  Love that one 
[02:51:30]  Yeah  Mike makes right  It's like crazy  I love that  Dead shit  He's the best man  Russ was just a hero  Who's the lead in this  Because she is  Fucking sexy man  The girl who played his wife  Sarah Jones  Yeah  I know  Awesome  I love her  Yeah  She's on that new TV show  It's called Vegas  With Dennis Quaid  Oh really  Yeah  She's in that show  Now  The movie  It's only 15 minutes long  It left me wanting more 
[02:52:00]  So are you trying to make  A full length feature  On Russ Meyer  Yeah exactly  Okay  So this is like  A teaser  Teaser  Let's get this out  To the film festival  See if we can get  Some backing  And some interest  Right  Yeah  And I never really  When we did this  I wasn't planning  On getting into festivals  Because like  You know  There's certain criteria  With a short film  That you have to  Kind of follow  It's like  Okay  It's 15 minutes  It's got to have  A three act structure  It's got to have  You know  Conflict resolution  And all this kind of stuff  And we were like  Okay well  What would be like  A snapshot  Of the feature  Just like 
[02:52:30]  To hone in  Like one little aspect  And so we just did it  Kind of as an exercise  But we figured  Okay let's try to get  Into some festivals  Get some exposure  Right  And it worked  Yeah  What I learned about  Russ Meyer  He was in the war  Comes back  And what  He just didn't know  What he wanted to do  With his life  Well yeah  He was a war photographer  In the 166  And he  During World War II  And stationed overseas  And he shot footage  For General Patton  And you know  He was always  Into photography  His mother bought him  His first camera 
[02:53:00]  When he was a kid  And it's something  That he just had  This great eye  And this propensity  For naturally  And he's  So  So how does that lead  To I'm going to film  Women with tits  Yeah  Because it seems like  If he was that talented  He probably could have  Went off in a bunch  Of other directions  What was it  What was it about the man  Where he had to go  Down that road  With this  It's  It was  It was  It was his compulsion  He was just drawn  To giant mammaries  It was a strange  Not really strange 
[02:53:30]  I don't blame the guy  And I'm glad he did  It was his obsession  And  You think he banged  These girls  After he photographed them  A lot of times  And I think that  That may have had to do  With like his  Him and his wife  Splitting  Who remained  His producing partner  Even after they broke up  But  So yeah  Like after the army  After the war  World War II  He did  He did  Industrial films  Well he started  With just  Photography  Just photography  That's true  And he  Where were those pictures  He did pin up photography 
[02:54:00]  For like  Pre-Playboy  Right  And  The compositions  Are gorgeous  I mean they're  He just like  Had a way of  Those old  Those guys  They're like  Masters of composition  Can we find some  Russ Meyer photos  There  They're really beautiful  And extremely sexy  And very provocative  Without being like  Showing the pig  Yeah exactly  There you go  Exactly right  If you made this movie  Right  Would you use this  15 minutes in it  Or would you have to  Reshoot this stuff  This is like  An extrapolation 
[02:54:30]  Of one of many themes  Much further explored  In the feature film  And it's  I would  We would use  Some of this  We'd reshoot everything  Oh you do  Okay  The entire  The entire thing  God damn  Absolutely  That's hot  Whoa  That's later  That's actually  His third wife  Edie Williams  Really  Wow  She's lovely  She was in  Beyond the Valley  Of Dolls  Big muff  Yeah  She's looking  Down her thong  Into her  Like she  She probably thought  An actual animal  Crawled into her underpants  It's just my pussy  It's 1968  Oh yeah 
[02:55:00]  I forgot  I'm living in 1968  Oh shit  That's like  Diana Valley Dolls  Yeah  It's 70  Something  Right  Yeah  That's Edie Williams  That's right  Oh these are great  So he does the pinups  And then he decides  You know why not  I think I could  Make some films  Because this is  Pre-porno  That's right  This is pretty much  The first mainstream porno  That's right  This is pre-porno  And he  Look at her ass  Gorgeous  It's really a plump  Like these  These women  I love the bodies 
[02:55:30]  On these women  Because they have  Real heavy tits  And real tits  And plump bottoms  I don't like  The hairy vag  But I love  Their natural bottoms  God you're right  Over there  It's true  Yeah  Oh wait  Can you talk a little  Oh yeah  Adam magazine  So Adam magazine  Was one of the  One of the early  Wow  You know  That's pre-Playboy  Obviously  Pre-Playboy  One of the  You know  I've never heard  Of Adam magazine  A girly magazine  She was like Monroe  That's what's her name  June Wilkinson  She was a  You know  Gorgeous  Gorgeous model  Russ photographed her a lot 
[02:56:00]  And that was one of his models  Yeah  And then  Did he bang her?  Probably  You know  He  He was a horn dog  He was definitely out there  Doing what he loved doing the most  And that was  But he didn't allow sex  With the actors  Like when they were filming  Because he wanted to fuck with me  Of course  Exactly  He wanted them like  Just aching for sex  Like before he rolled cameras  So he didn't allow  Any of that on set  Except those rules  Didn't apply for him  Of course  He did  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  So  This was pre-Playboy 
[02:56:30]  Then he met his wife  Eve Turner  And he actually shot her for Playboy  And did centerfolds in like 55  She was fucking beautiful  Sarah Jones  Is that Eve?  That's Eve right there  Oh look at her  She's on the couch  With a fucking rump  Sticking up in the air  Make that bigger there  I've seen that picture before  You've seen that one?  Yeah  Yeah  I think I scrapped that one  A few times  Look at her ass  Oh she fantastic  A little big feeder on the ground  What?  She's just playing  She's just playing a few records  Man  She's just hanging out  Just hanging out  Playing some records of the day  Just with a little shirt on 
[02:57:00]  And then no panties or anything  And she's kind of got her ass  Poking up in the air  I don't like the way he shot her foot though  Because the color blends into the paper  It looks like she has a flipper  Like  That's a terrible foot shot  You don't like the flipper foot?  No but it's only the angle  You can't see where the angle  The form of the ankle  So it looks like she has a fat flipper cankle  That's a great shot  To just come screaming in  From the left hand side  And swoop your face  Right  Oh look at her  Fucking  Her hiney  So plump  She says kiss me  I eat thongs  Fuck 
[02:57:30]  Oh man  Yeah totally  What else can you tell us about  Russ Meyer  That's good  Russ Meyer  He loved  He just loved  Show me the color version  He's high perched  Yeah that's Eve right there  Is she dead  Yeah she died in a plane crash  Unfortunately like 1977  It's crazy crazy  It's insane  Oh look at her fucking body  Oh man  Yeah yeah  It's incredible  Does Sarah Jones have a body like that?  I didn't see her body actually  Quite to this extent  I mean she's  She's very very well purported  She married  She has a boyfriend 
[02:58:00]  Why wouldn't she?  Yeah  Why wouldn't she?  She's real  And such a great actress  Really really great actress  Yes  Very very cool  Plank  Yeah  And Jim Parrick was Russ Meyer  And he did a great job  He was great  Yeah he loves this show  He's like big fans of all you guys  Oh really?  He's going to be in town for the movie  He's a good actor  On the 14th  And he said he  Would he play Russ Meyer in the feature  If you get it?  I would love to have him play Russ Meyer  Absolutely  He can definitely do that  Would Sarah be in?  I would love to have her also  She's awesome  She's such a real  Real great actress 
[02:58:30]  Real serious  That fucking Eve's body  And that color photo  And that color photo is awesome  That's Eve up top  That's her right there  I don't think that's Eve  Oh there they go  She's above that one  If you go back  What a wonderful  Like two up  She recreated the shot  That color one  That's Eve  Jesus  I like the one on the couch better  But that fucking ass is so juicy  You just want to put your face there  And just sniff  Did Eve do any mainstream acting  Or was it all  She did 
[02:59:00]  She was in Russ's  Like one of  You know  His early film  Eve and the Handyman  And  Eve and the Handyman  That's not a mainstream movie  What is that about?  No  That's about  I think  As far as her acting career  Maybe like one  It's about  It's like a  It's kind of like a silent film  Did you see it?  Yeah  Yeah  I saw like most  All of us  He did so many films  There's tons of information  On this guy  It's because  He did so much  Is Eve and the Handyman  A good movie?  It's cute  It's very clever  It's interesting  Can we get a clip 
[02:59:30]  From Eve and the Handyman  Sam?  Yeah  It's like  Even the Handyman  It's like French New Wave  I don't know  Cinematic terms  It's like a  Jacques Tate type film  It's very clever  Of course  We all know that  You all know that kind of stuff  I don't know  I'm with you on that  It's more like a  It's an elegant type of  Portrayal of absurdity  Man is always looking for  New worlds to conquer  Great  Can I get bigger Sam  So I can see this  Wonderful movie  It's a  It's a talkie  It's a space feature  Hmm  We're going to the moon
