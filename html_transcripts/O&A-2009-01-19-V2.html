<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie and Jimmy Norton recounting their successful three-night stand at the Borgata in Atlantic City, noting the subdued post-show mood due to the Eagles' NFC Championship loss.  Opie voiced his support for the Cardinals in the Super Bowl, leading to a digression about the team's history and the Illinois state bird.

The hosts then shared humorous stories from their weekend getaway with Lenny Marcus and producer Kenny.  These included Kenny sleeping in his car after a late night and accidentally destroying a case of beer meant for Danny.  Kenny's exhaustion and his efforts to avoid being a burden were discussed.  The conversation took a bizarre turn, comparing the excessive violence in a recently seen movie to the relative lack of violence in films like *Bride Wars* and *Mall Cop*.  Stevie Wonder's weight gain was also observed.  The inauguration of President Obama was mentioned, with a comparison drawn – albeit a loose one – between Obama's train journey and Lincoln's.

The highlight of the show was the early, unauthorized airing of U2's new song, "Get On Your Boots,"  despite the record company's request to hold off until 9:00 am. The song was played and briefly discussed. The show teased the upcoming appearances of Patrice O'Neal and Robert Kelly.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Get a mic on it.  What are you trying to do?  No, no, let her go.  Let her go.  Where's the door?  Let her go.  She's screaming.  I'm not supposed to be doing this. 
[00:00:30]  Not right there.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Of course Anthony's not here for Martin Luther King Day.  Of course.  He's honoring Dr. King by taking the holiday.  Right.  Stud Brink called me.  He said, Anthony's sick.  I'm like, of course he's sick.  He doesn't want to deal with this nonsense today. 
[00:01:00]  Of course he's sick.  But we got a lot of people coming in.  It's me and Jimmy to start.  I walked in.  I forgot we have Patrice coming in.  I thought he was here at 6.  And I always walk in as the music started.  It was so weird.  It was just open.  Just sitting here like the old days.  Weird.  It was surreal.  There's days I just sit here and wonder who I'm doing the radio show with.  Today it's old Jimmy Norton, Patrice O'Neal, and Robert Kelly will be here a little later on. 
[00:01:30]  And you've got to be tired, man.  I am, yes.  But I'm not that bad, actually.  Yeah.  I'm used to going on a couple hours, so I'll be fine.  Three huge shows at the Bregada down there in Atlantic City.  It was great, yeah.  You had one last night.  Yeah.  That must have been crazy with the Eagles losing, though.  It was...  You would think...  I would think there'd be a bunch of animals in the crowd that just want to kill somebody.  We were worried.  That is Eagle territory, my friend.  I think a lot of people who were at the Eagles...  The Eagles fans who lost, I think, didn't come. 
[00:02:00]  I think a lot of them were bummed out.  And just said, screw this, I'm going home.  I'm going home.  Because there was a tremendous amount of jerseys running around the hotel.  Right.  But after...  Who wants to party after your team gets knocked out of the NFC Championship?  That's a rough one.  Yeah.  I have no interest in the Eagles whatsoever.  I said it last week.  People said, oh, the Philly crew, the Philly crew.  I don't care about the Eagles.  I think I like this Cardinals team.  I think the Cardinals go all the way, right?  They look good.  They look really good.  So it's Cardinals, Steelers, and the Super Bowl. 
[00:02:30]  Two who-gives-a-crap teams, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  So...  Real ratings grabber.  I know.  The Cardinals.  I was just reading about the Cardinals.  Last time they were in the Super Bowl.  It was 1948.  And I mention this because they were called the Chicago Cardinals.  That's right.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  And I like to know a little bit about sports.  They used to be called the Chicago Cardinals.  Yes, sir.  So their Cardinals name is based on something out of Chicago?  Because that's what they usually do with these sports teams. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  The Illinois State Bird is the Cardinal.  Oh.  How'd you know that?  I grew up in Chicago.  So what?  I live in Jersey my whole life.  It was on the test.  Oh.  All I know about the Jersey is the governor likes to drink mule juice.  Very, very good.  I'm kind of bummed I didn't go to Atlantic City to check out the shows.  But I wanted a lazy weekend.  Yeah.  You know.  But now I feel bad.  I wanted to see Jimmy.  It's all right, man.  It was good.  And I was really...  We really wanted... 
[00:03:30]  Lenny Marcus did the weekend shows with me.  Eric McMahon did Friday.  And then Lenny did Saturday, Sunday.  And I really wanted Kenny to introduce Lenny last night.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, your opening act works with Jim all over.  From Arizona.  Please welcome Lenny Marcus.  I didn't have the guts to do it because I was afraid that it would just...  Like that they would boo him.  I was afraid that...  You don't want F Lenny.  No.  F him.  And then F Jim.  They wouldn't give you...  We like Lenny a lot, but F him.  That would have been a great gag.  Watching Lenny get booed off would have been fantastic.  Yeah.  But it was more about...  That would affect me.  Selfish me. 
[00:04:00]  Right, right, right.  I was like, that might just bleed over, man.  It's true.  You don't need those drunks.  Ah, that's screaming.  That's pretty funny.  I should have done it, but I couldn't.  I was like, ah, no Arizona mention.  No Arizona.  Speaking of Kenny, I think we start the show today with a little song in honor of Martin Luther  King.  Just a little taste.  Oh, good.  Kenny's gonna throw out the first one today for Martin Luther King.  Check this out.  One man come in the name of love. 
[00:04:30]  One man come and go.  One come he to justify.  One man to overthrow.  In the name of love.  One more in the name of love.  In the name of love. 
[00:05:00]  One more in the name of love.  That's all we're gonna give you today.  Actually, he should sing the whole song, though.  But I think Kenny's a little tired.  Kenny picks me up.  He looks like a freaking zombie.  And I know you guys had a rough weekend.  Atlantic City coming home late last night.  Yeah.  I heard you guys got back around 2, 2.30, only a mere few hours ago.  Yeah, it was after 2.00.  And I got a really nice place right next to Jimmy, who has a really nice place.  And I'm like, Kenny, where'd you sleep last night? 
[00:05:30]  He goes, oh, I found a real quiet spot on Central Park West, and I slept in my car.  I'm like, you're an idiot.  What is wrong with you?  He told me-  Where is that dope?  He told me that he was gonna sleep.  I'm like, where are you gonna sleep?  He's like, oh, on the couch at CBS.  I thought he was gonna come crash for a few hours.  I'm like, oh, that's-  I wasn't even thinking of him picking you up.  I was like, oh, that's easier.  He's right at work.  Right, right.  You know what?  I'm so sick of Kenny, and I didn't want to bother you.  I can't want you to stay on my couch for two hours. 
[00:06:00]  I'm so sick of that crap.  I worked midnights for seven years and slept in a radio car for seven years.  Well, good for you.  How about you sleep in a bed?  It was like-  It was like a nice two-hour thing.  I reclined my seat.  You could have got hypothermia.  No, no.  They could have found you frozen in your car this morning, which, trust me, would have  been hilarious for everybody.  The truck is running with the heat on.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  You cracked the window.  I know what I'm doing.  You cracked the window a little bit, which is- 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  You told me you were coming here.  I was going to come here, but it's just easier to just pull over.  No, he lies to everybody, because he doesn't want to be a bother.  He knew the whole time he wasn't coming here.  He shouldn't have done that.  I wasn't thinking of you picking up up.  I thought, this is great.  You wake up, you're at work.  That was stupid.  Right.  Yeah, I am stupid, but it was fine.  Please don't concern yourself with me.  You guys do a wonderful radio show.  That's what you should be concentrating on.  Yeah.  I have a sofa though.  No one sleeps on it.  Yeah, but you're, you know- 
[00:07:00]  I have a sofa.  I have a guest room.  I know.  I have a comfy little chair.  I got a windowsill.  We could have put some pillows down.  You could have checked out the view.  I was very happy when I was.  And then he goes, I didn't want to wake you.  And he knows my place.  I wouldn't even know when you were there.  I was very happy.  We leave a little key for you.  You come upstairs.  Thank you, but I am not deserving of all the concern you're giving me.  Ugh.  I used to think, wow, that's pretty cool.  What a nice guy, but now it's just, ugh, shut up.  Nothing cool about him. 
[00:07:30]  Enough.  Just stay on the couch.  Right.  And then when I was bringing in a case of beer for Danny that I have just laying around  from New Year's, you know, we overbought for our little party.  So I go, here, Kenny, I'm going to give this to Danny.  And we're walking on the sidewalk and all of a sudden I hear behind me a huge explosion.  I turn around.  There's Kenny staring down at the case of beer as it's just pouring out onto the sidewalk.  I've never seen a case explode more in my life.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool like that.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  The handle broke.  Next thing you know, he's like lifting up the case and it's just pouring beer, throwing  it into the garbage, pal.  Yeah.  The cardboard handle broke, which caused me to fumble it.  So now poor Danny is out a case of beer because-  No, I'm going to replace it because-  Come on.  Because of my inadequacies, I will make good for it.  Danny will get inebriated because of me and Opie.  You are so tired. 
[00:08:30]  You are so tired.  I know.  He almost fell asleep last night behind the wheel.  Of course.  It's the first time he ever let someone take the wheel.  Yeah.  I made him.  I made him once too when I pretty much looked over and saw his head all the way back and  he was snoring.  I'm like, Kenny, trust me, you have to pull over.  We're coming back from Boston, but it happened last night.  I didn't even know he was that tired.  I was in the back seat and I heard Lenny go, man, you look tired.  And Kenny goes, you want to drive, Lenny?  That fast.  He pulls over in 30 seconds.  I'm like, I've been asking you for five years if you're tired, but I can't drive the truck. 
[00:09:00]  Thank God someone noticed.  Because Kenny would never go, you know, guys, I'm a bit tired and I know I'm quote the help,  but I think I might crash.  So one of you guys have to drive.  He would never say that.  No.  No.  He's the notorious L.E.N.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's what he calls Lenny.  Oh, really?  Notorious L.E.N.  That's wonderful.  You know, because of the movie that came out this weekend with all the shootings and stabbings.  Well, yeah, there was a lot of problems with the notorious movie. 
[00:09:30]  How many people were stabbed?  Notorious.  Four stabbed in one shot.  Four stabbed in one shot is the running total on that.  The way four men were stabbed at a New York nightclub advertising an after party.  Yeah.  It was only like at one club.  Yeah.  But there was a shooting in another city.  And there was a shooting in another city.  So that's not bad.  No.  Could have been worse.  Why don't they do that for movies like Bride Wars or something?  Or Mall Cop.  Oh, the Pink Panther. 
[00:10:00]  How great have you Steve Martin got stabbed?  Oh, God.  Yeah, well.  One of Clouseau's relatives.  Eh, eh.  Or Peter Sellers if I would have...  That's all right.  No Clouseau.  Everyone's tired.  I'm really tired.  It's not here.  But we got a big show today for everybody.  Yeah, but you and Jimmy look bubbly.  We are bubbly.  I don't know.  Why don't you go lay down on the couch for a little while?  I got work to do.  What do you got to do?  I got to attend to you guys.  I don't shrug my responsibilities.  Are you talking about your from Friday night? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I was hammered.  Oh, my God.  Kenny calls me on...  No, I called you on Saturday because I wanted to see how everything was going down there.  And we were debating if we were going to go down or not.  And I got Kenny on the phone around 9, 9.30 in the morning, which is extremely early,  especially for casino time, right?  Most people don't go to bed until, what, 4 or 5 if you're in a casino.  You know, Kenny was still drunk.  And I'm like, Kenny?  What the F?  Because Kenny doesn't drink.  I don't know if people know that.  But for the most part, you stop drinking when you start having kids, right? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  Because they don't understand hangovers.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But now, those same kids are of drinking age.  So, to bond with your older son, you went and got hammered with him.  Yeah.  We had a few pops.  Dude, I wish I taped him.  He was so gone.  So gone.  I didn't see him drunk either.  I had gone to bed, actually.  I didn't hear my manager and Pete were out. 
[00:11:30]  Apparently, Ty went on and then he saw his son and they got loaded.  Yeah.  And he was talking about being in the club.  Yeah.  With a bottle of bub.  I don't even know why I brought it up on the show because without the audio, maybe  it doesn't do it justice.  But it was quite entertaining to talk to you on Saturday morning.  Yeah.  It was an evening.  Yeah.  And we had a nice conversation about it.  Yeah.  I guess you had to be there.  I've never seen you drunk.  In all the years I know Kenny, I've never seen him drunk. 
[00:12:00]  I'm professional.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, you know, if you were down there, then I'd be on duty.  Doing what?  I got to take care of you.  All you got to do is stop somebody from stabbing me.  You just hang out.  No.  All right, Kenny.  I think you're still hung over.  You're obviously tired.  Yeah.  Go fetch something.  That'll make you happy.  All righty.  We're supposed to wait till nine, but I want to be the first one in America to play this 
[00:12:30]  because I'm a huge fan.  We got the latest song from U2.  Oh, wow.  And the record companies, everyone's like, you got to wait till nine.  Why do you have to wait?  Who gives a crap?  They want the exposure, right?  So let's get, let's start the exposure.  And I guarantee as I play this, people are like, dude, I downloaded that a week ago.  So who cares if you were, you know, why would you have to wait?  New U2, get on your boots, it's called.  You're not into U2, are you?  No, I don't hate them.  I'm just not a, you know. 
[00:13:00]  They played yesterday at the Obama thing.  Yeah, I saw the lineup, Springsteen and Them and just a whole bunch of people.  What do you mean Them?  The group Them?  U2.  Oh, you scared me.  Why?  There was a band called Them.  Oh, no, Them.  I'm like, what, they're bringing Them out of retirement for the Obama inauguration?  Yes, Them played for those people.  Right.  No, I meant that.  There really was a band called Them.  What was their hit?  I find that really fast.  They had one or two hits, this band called Them. 
[00:13:30]  I gotta be, I like Obama, but I'm sick of the way he talks.  Why?  It's because it's already, we Americans, it's always there, it's all very, it's too powerful.  Yeah.  I wanna hear him just be casual.  He can't do anything wrong right now, but that first mess up, it's gonna be pretty depressing  for everybody.  Because, you know, he's not gonna be able to keep this popularity up.  What do you got, Danny?  Is it Mystic Eyes?  No.  Gloria.  Oh, yeah, they did Gloria. 
[00:14:00]  I have that if you want.  Yeah, this is Them.  Just a piece.  Eh?  So I'm thinking, wait, they got this band together for Obama?  It would've been great if they got this band and they just played everything but this song.  Right.  They played all their, like, obscure, they went deep tracks.  Right.  They just refused to play Gloria, everyone's waiting for it.  200,000 people getting restless. 
[00:14:30]  There's always a band that does that to you.  They have to be pompous, like, yeah, I'm not, we're not playing any of our hits, man.  Stupid Neil Young, that's who I'm talking about.  And how fat did Stevie Wonder get?  They showed clothes.  Wow.  What a fatso he is.  I guess he can't read calorie counts, fair enough, but Jesus.  And I thought Stunt Brain had some horrendous hair loss.  My God, what's going on with Stevie Wonder?  I didn't even notice it.  He's still braiding his hair, but it looks like he's braiding it from, like, the horseshoe  and trying to push it forward or something.  It's bizarre looking.  I just noticed.  It looks like the top of his head was in a flash fire or something. 
[00:15:00]  How old is he?  He's got to be 60-something at this point.  He has to be.  I was a nothing and he was famous already.  I just could not believe how fat he was.  They showed clips of Springsteen, they showed clips of U2, they showed a clip of him, and  they showed Obama and the kids and Michelle kind of dancing and snapping.  And I'm like, well, they dance as horrible as any white presidential family.  No kidding.  They are not a rhythm-having black family at all.  Nope.  He was born in 1950. 
[00:15:30]  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, he's 59.  That's it?  Yeah.  For Stevie Wonder?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get into the Obama discussion after the break.  I watched that damn train ride all day, what was it, yesterday or Saturday?  It was Saturday, right?  Taking the slow train ride from Philly to Washington, stopping along the way, giving speeches,  kind of doing the Lincoln thing.  But I was thinking to myself, he's not really doing the Lincoln thing, because Lincoln started  in where?  Springfield, Illinois?  Springfield, Illinois.  And Lincoln's was a secret.  Well, of course, because we didn't have iPods and the internet. 
[00:16:00]  How do you get the word out?  They were worried about people taking shots at him.  Right.  And when you go through towns, the railroad tracks weren't connected, so they used to  have to take the cars off and pull them by horse over to the next station.  It was a mess.  So Obama kind of wanted to do the Lincoln thing, but he kind of did a very short version  of the Lincoln thing, because Lincoln was on the road for how long?  About, I think it was nine or ten days.  Nine or ten days, and I read that he gave a hundred speeches before he got to Washington. 
[00:16:30]  A hundred speeches.  So that would be about ten a day if it was nine or ten days, right?  Mm-hmm.  Unbelievable.  Everybody had to spread the word.  They probably misquoted him.  They had no idea what he was saying.  Now you just say it once and it's done.  It's easier now.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's listen to this new U2 song.  We're supposed to wait till nine, but come on.  In this day and age, why bother?  The song is called Get On Your Boots.  Checking it out for the first time right here on the Opie and Anthony Show, starring Jim  The 
[00:17:00]  The  Future needs a big kiss, winds blow with its wrist.  Never seen a moon like this, can you see it too?  Night is falling everywhere, rockets hit the fun fair.  Satan loves a bomb scam, it won't scare you.  I'll see you.  Hey, since you both, ugh, ugh.  Get on your boots, yeah.  Free me from a dark dream, candy falls, ice cream, all the kids are screaming but the ghosts 
[00:17:30]  aren't real.  Real's really gotta be loved and community-life to raise eternity if joy is real.  You don't know how beautiful, you don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are. 
[00:18:00]  You don't know how beautiful you are. 
[00:18:30]  You don't know how beautiful, you don't know how beautiful you are. 
[00:19:00]  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are. 
[00:19:30]  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  You don't know how beautiful you are.  We'll be right back. 
[00:20:00]  Well, I guess we could have waited until 9, huh?  What do you think?  I like the way it started.  Coach Logic likes it.  He's saying it looks like U2's been listening to Beck.  It has a little bit of Beck in there.  Yeah, exactly.  It's called Get On Your Boots, U2. 
[00:20:30]  I liked it when it first started, but then I stopped liking it.  I don't hate it, but...  That's all right.  It's one of those songs I think it's going to have to grow on you.  Now, make believe we didn't play because this radio station is going to promote all day  that they're debuting it at 9 o'clock or something like that, right?  Yeah.  That's their big thing today.  That's the thing they decided to do today, right?  Yes, sir.  Just spend all their time promoting the fact they got a three-minute U2 song,  and they're going to make you wait until 9.  We don't make you wait.  No.  We probably should have, though, because, I don't know.  It's all right.  All right, we're going to take a quick break and continue. 
[00:21:00]  Patrice should be joining the program after the break.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  All right.  All right. </pre>
