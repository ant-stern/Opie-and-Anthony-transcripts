<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of their upcoming live broadcast from Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras.  This led to Opie recounting an embarrassing hotel incident involving soiled underwear.  The "Naughty Nighty" contest dominated a significant portion, with the hosts reviewing listener-submitted photos, discussing contestants' appearances, professions (including a purported porn star), and receiving calls from individuals with inside knowledge of some contestants, including one caller who described a contestant as an "anal monster." Another caller requested removal from the contest due to a link to a friend's band's website.  The hosts also commented on an MSNBC news graphic error that misspelled a guest's name offensively.  Ozzy Osbourne made a brief call to discuss his TV show.  The segment concluded with the shocking announcement of plans to have a listener lose her virginity live on-air for Valentine's Day, and a debate about identifying a caller's race based on their voice.

The show then transitioned to listener calls and a discussion about a planned "slut day" at Mardi Gras, and promotion of a "55-gallon drum challenge."  Opie graphically described a gangbang at a Super Bowl party.  Several callers contributed to the conversation, including "D," who discussed a sleazy hotel and a friend, Keisha, losing her virginity; Nate, planning a trip to New Orleans to see the show; and Adam from Manhattan, commenting on the difficulty in understanding Keisha and Ozzy Osbourne. A "F.U." segment aired, featuring angry listener messages.  A comedic high point occurred when comedian Brian Regan and a New Orleans "BJ girl," Oasis, were both on hold simultaneously, leading to the hosts connecting them. Oasis detailed her "slut day" activities, including giving oral sex to attractive men, and discussed her website documenting her sexual encounters, complete with a "scoreboard." Regan's participation became increasingly bizarre as he connected his comedy to Oasisâ€™s activities.  The conversation returned to the alleged Super Bowl gangbang, where participants engaged in sexual acts for money or prizes. The hosts then discussed the upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge," detailing its history (including the use of hissing cockroaches), and playing audio clips from past challenges filled with screams and descriptions of foul-smelling substances.  Al from New Orleans expressed interest in the challenge, then withdrew it, leading to speculation about image concerns.  Further discussion of the "Naughty Nighty contest" ensued, along with mentions of "Boob Man," who offered free boob touching. Oasis's website address was revealed (with censorship).  The segment concluded with more listener calls and a call from musician Buddy Epson, who promoted his CD and played some of his songs.

Buddy Epson then appeared as a musical guest, performing several versions of his song "Well Doggies," including a Civil War-themed rendition.  The hosts joked with him about the song and his previous "saucy" parody of the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  Following this, a vulgar and sexually explicit "queef-off" segment involving several female callers took place, marked by insults and personal attacks between callers and hosts.  One caller's husband intervened, claiming the hosts were deliberately antagonizing his wife.  A winner was declared.  An interview followed with Katie, who got a Clinton administration internship after submitting a photo of herself in a red dress. The hosts and Katie discussed the incident, Bill Clinton's personal life, and Katie's political views.  A "silent game" ensued, followed by a brief mention of Carlos Mencia being in the studio, a listener's message about a 56-year-old pregnant woman, and a call from Big Mike, discussing his stepmother's unexpected pregnancy at 56.  A heated exchange followed with 14-year-old Gary, who shared a similar family experience.

The final segment centered on multiple "Garys" calling in.  The hosts debated replacing 12-year-old Gary with a seemingly more mature 14-year-old Gary, engaging in a heated and vulgar exchange between the two young callers.  The situation escalated with the introduction of a 28-year-old Gary.  Comedian Rich Voss was a guest in the studio, discussing his stand-up routine, old car, and a perceived rivalry with Patrice.  The hosts mocked Voss's jokes and attire. The conversation shifted to a caller, Elisa, who was experiencing prolonged menstruation and sought advice about her sex life.  Crude and insensitive commentary ensued.  Jim Norton offered a final sarcastic remark to conclude the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show. For today, a couple of phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else, including New Orleans, Valley, going to be there live tomorrow, broadcasting live from Bourbon Street.  Like, yeah.  Mardi Gras.  Oh, my God.  From the balcony.  What a party that's going to be.  From a balcony inside a strip club.  Yep.  Good God.  A recipe for disaster. 
[00:00:30]  It's going to be fun.  I love the idea.  It's like home for us.  It's going to be a lot of fun, so I hope you check out the festivities tomorrow.  And if you're in the area, stop by and say hi.  Right?  Yeah, a lot of people, I think, from a lot of the cities we broadcast from.  We're going to be there for Mardi Gras, so stop on by.  Say hello.  We're leaving right after the show tonight.  Yes.  Right after the show.  Right after the show. 
[00:01:00]  Is Brewer going to be coming in today?  No, no, no, no.  Maybe at the end of the show?  No, no, no.  What happened to Brewer yesterday?  Anyone find out?  He couldn't get away.  He was taping something for Comedy Central.  Oh.  And those bastards wouldn't let him leave to come hang with us for a while.  Oh, well.  I'm in a bit of a panic here because I just checked out of my hotel room.  And I had a little problem last night. 
[00:01:30]  Did you have a nervous stomach?  I had a little nervous stomach.  I was having a little problem.  And I left my underwear behind.  And it's not a pretty sight.  I could only imagine what the maid thought when she picked those up off the bed this morning.  You left your underwear on the bed.  And they had that...  Yeah, I had to, like, rush out of the room and stuff. 
[00:02:00]  And I forgot, like, a pair of socks in my underwear and...  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's not pretty.  Oh, my God.  It's like a used shoeshine rag.  Oh, I don't know what the hell was going on.  But I was hoping to, you know, get rid of the evidence and maybe throw it in a, I don't know, garbage pail on the way to work today or something.  Yeah, just, like, get rid of it.  Get rid of the evidence.  But instead, it was left in the room.  It's awful.  Yeah, I know, Marco.  I know. 
[00:02:30]  But I'm feeling better today.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm much better today.  What's up, Jimmy?  How are you?  Jimmy Norton in the house.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right.  Like we said, yeah, we're leaving.  We're leaving right after the show.  Yeah, right after the show.  Did you...  What?  Have you ever heard about some more shenanigans and hijinks on a United Airlines flight?  We're leaving right after the show. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Right after.  That bag, that bag, that one, and those three over there, go.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Do it now.  I just want to be, you know, prepared.  They say there's long delays at the airport, so I just want to make sure everything's in  order.  Everything's ready to rock.  No, we'll be right there.  We're just doing a little something here.  How cool is this, though?  Some guy was banging on the cockpit door.  Why you would do this is beyond me.  And one of the passengers gets up and tries to grab my guest. 
[00:03:30]  But the co-pilot opens the door.  This is great.  This is something you just did not see happening before 9-11.  And hits him in the head with a hatchet.  How does this story go?  That is fantastic.  The guy's banging on the door, some guy, and a passenger yelled, what are you doing?  Gets up, tried to subdue him.  The co-pilot grabbed one of those small little hatchets and just laid it over his head. 
[00:04:00]  Blood everywhere.  Split him wide open?  Well, I think he hit him with a blunt end, which is the only thing I could fault him on.  Ouch.  Yeah.  You're going to hit someone with a hatchet.  Use the business end of it.  Yeah, yeah.  But I guess it was good enough because it just cracked his head open.  He started bleeding all over the place.  And they got him down after that.  But it's just, it's kind of like, goddamn, the Alamo in the sky.  We get them tomahawks. 
[00:04:30]  Beat them head in.  Then we take them scalps.  They're hitting the co-pilot.  The only thing that guy ever had to worry about was, you know, the pilot's got to take a leak.  Keep your eyes on the instruments.  You got to make out a few maps.  Yeah, you know, kind of look over some systems.  Check the weather real fast.  Right.  I think the important question is, though, as a passenger, does it affect your frequent flyer status if the co-pilot brains you with a small act?  I think it might forfeit some of those valuable points if you get beamed with a hatchet. 
[00:05:00]  What do the passengers do?  I guess, you know, wrestle him to the ground as he was gushing blood from his head.  You know, which is great.  I like that whole thing.  Group participation.  Yeah.  There's no risk, really, in touching a stranger's blood, you know.  Well, no, no.  At that point, though, you got to just go for it and get some kicks in at least.  Like, I might not be the first guy up.  I'd like to think I would.  And until that situation comes about, I don't think anyone could ever know if you're going to be the guy, if it's happening near you, 
[00:05:30]  and the opportunity is about that you're the first guy that makes the move to try to take the guy out.  But I can guarantee you one thing, when he is down and pretty much subdued, I am kicking him in the face a couple of times.  You're that guy.  I'll be that guy.  We had a few of those guys.  I got no problem.  We had a few of those guys in the fraternity.  What?  We had the big rumbles and stuff.  They would wait until the scene was secure, and then they would get their shots in. 
[00:06:00]  Look.  You know, you bring up an interesting point.  Before 9-11, I was like you.  Yeah.  I wouldn't get involved.  Now, after 9-11, I have no doubt in my mind I'd be, I would try to be the first guy.  You've got to be the guy.  If, like, it's happening next to you, you know, it's happening right next to you.  Before 9-11, I'm thinking, ah, okay, this guy looks a little weird, but, you know, we're in a controlled situation here,  and the flight attendants know what they're doing, you know, whatever.  But now, no, I would definitely try to be the first guy.  The first guy.  But, like I said, you know, you never know what you're going to do until the situation comes about. 
[00:06:30]  But guaranteed, you know, even if I couldn't muster up the courage to be the guy,  I would be the guy that just stomps his head in while the rest of the passengers are holding him down.  I got no pride.  You're wrong.  I do know what I'd do if they tried taking over the plane.  I didn't even think of that option.  Yeah, I would get a girl to show her boobs immediately.  That seems to calm down a lot of people. 
[00:07:00]  Let's go to Sean and get the show rolling here.  Sean, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  I saw the WOW sticker on the job last night, but it just said WOW.  It didn't say Opie and Anthony.  It didn't have 102.7.  It's like they airbrushed it out.  No, they had to put something over the station.  Yeah, Adam explained that.  It's okay.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I was very proud to see you guys getting your props.  I just thought it was weird that O and A wasn't on it.  Anthony said, though, last night, I missed the show.  Yeah, you can see the O and the P in the Opie because the close-up they had on that sticker last night was ridiculous. 
[00:07:30]  They zoomed in.  The phone was ringing on Adam's desk.  So he goes to pick it up, and the sticker's right behind his phone.  And it was a full-screen shot of just the WOW sticker and the phone.  And you could see where they had to put some black electrical tape over the Opie and Anthony 102.7 for N.E.W. here in New York.  And the O and the P from Opie's name was kind of poking out of the tape.  Yeah, Sean, I mean, that's good enough for us.  Oh, no, absolutely.  That makes us happy.  And, you know, the faithful listeners know that's our WOW logo. 
[00:08:00]  We know it's not about us, douchebag.  You know what I mean?  And it's nice that it's not about us.  The show is about, you know, Dennis and Adam and Lenny.  Yeah, this whole getting WOW on TV thing has entered a whole new level.  Yeah, now it's network television on ABC every week.  It's going to be in every episode of The Job on ABC 930.  And now they're starting to talk about maybe having our voices in the car while they're driving around. 
[00:08:30]  You know, I'm willing to just sit back and wait for the opportunities come up.  We help the show.  The show helps us.  One hand washes the other.  If the ratings keep going up for that show and we have anything to do with it,  just getting the word out that it's a great show and it's on Wednesdays, 930.  Did you see how hot Gina Gershaw was or what?  I missed it because I went to that sex hall.  She is hot, man.  She's so adorable.  She has a look.  And then when she turned around and started walking away from Dennis Leary and takes her shirt off,  and you saw from the back, and she's wearing little hip hugger things, she looks really good. 
[00:09:00]  And then over in front of the minibar, when she was in front of the minibar and a can was sticking right up.  Yeah.  Leary starts grabbing his collar like he's walking.  Like, oh, God.  You guys suck.  All right.  Was the show good last night?  Very funny, man.  Really good.  Yeah.  Great show.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey, what's up, Tom?  Yo, I learned something today already.  What?  A learner's not going to be able to learn today.  Well, Tom, you know, I'm looking at the sheet. 
[00:09:30]  There's a lot of things we've got to get to today.  Uh-huh.  We just might not have enough time at the end of the show to do what we learned.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  But that just means the quality of the show.  That's not all I learned, brother.  That means the quality of the show is going to be right up there today.  Uh-oh.  A girl wants to drop out of the Naughty Nighty contest.  What's the problem?  Christy.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  I want to withdraw from the Naughty Nighty contest.  Why?  What happened?  Well, um.  All right.  What number are you, first of all?  Hold on.  What number?  Seventy. 
[00:10:00]  Uh-oh.  Let me look.  Uh-oh.  Those later numbers are solid girls.  Seventy?  Oh, no.  From B.C.  You didn't even put up the right pictures.  That doesn't matter.  Oh, no.  Why do you want to take that out?  We like how your long hair is covering your Naughty spot there.  That's a great shot.  That's a really sexy shot.  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh.  What's the matter?  Hmm?  What's the matter?  Wait, Christy.  Well, it kind of got put on to it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Christy.  That didn't sound like a good O.  It was like, are you Opie and Anthony? 
[00:10:30]  You went, oh.  You have a point?  Well, no.  I didn't think I was going to talk to you guys.  I thought you were going to talk to somebody who was working.  So what's the problem?  Well, somebody put hyperlink to another internet site of a band that I know, and I didn't want  it broadcasted like that.  So I figured the safe side.  Hyperlink to a band?  What?  Somebody, okay.  Somebody anonymously put a hyperlink to another website.  Opie and Anthony.com, because somebody that I know that doesn't want me to know found 
[00:11:00]  out that I tried out for the Nile United contest.  Oh, so all of a sudden you go to this other website that maybe people you know go to?  A friend of mine's band's website.  Oh.  They put a hyperlink there.  And you can click on it, and then all of a sudden they see you.  You, a girl they've seen at many of the gigs and barely any clothes.  Well, in this shot, no clothes with the hair covering up everything there.  Well, yeah, but still, you know.  What's the band's name?  Pete Evick Band.  Will that help your situation? 
[00:11:30]  What?  Saying the band's name.  No.  Wanting it to just tell the band to remove the hyperlink.  He did remove the hyperlink, but I still want the pictures removed, because I have a little  boy, and I don't want my ex-husband saying them.  Oh, I gotcha.  Well, you've got to think, if you're entering a contest like this, that just a few people  are going to check you out, right?  Well, yeah, but you guys didn't even put up the good pictures.  What?  That last one's great.  And you'll put three up.  Yeah, well, we don't, um... 
[00:12:00]  I'm digging your shots, sure.  Yeah, I mean...  I mean, if you want us to remove you, we could do that.  Then we will...  Would you?  Yeah, it's not going to affect the final outcome, so...  All right.  So we could do that.  All right.  Well, bye-bye, Christy.  Bye-bye.  Number 70 from D.C.  All right.  I hope you don't hold this against us or anything.  No, not at all.  All right.  You'll keep listening?  Sure, why not?  All right.  All right.  Scott Colombo, if you could remove...  Christy.  Contestant 70, Christy from D.C.  And if you're listening and want to check her out for the last time, you better do it 
[00:12:30]  quickly.  It's kind of odd, too, when you've been, you know, giving hummers to a band on the road  for five years.  Now, all of a sudden, you're worried that someone's going to see you in a little nightgown.  Yeah, right.  Hey, Christy's still on the phone, Jim.  Usually, we wait till we hang up on the fine listener.  All right, Christy.  Thanks.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Christy is out of the contest.  Oh, wow.  Today and tomorrow is the last two days to enter the Naughty Nighty contest, and we'll  start the voting on Monday.  So, ladies, you can show up at all those fine radio stations that are participating with 
[00:13:00]  your Naughty Nighties.  We're hoping for 100 girls.  We got a few new entries overnight, Anthony.  Yes.  Can we go to those new entries?  Let's go to them now.  Let me check this out.  We have...  Who's new?  Let's see.  We got Karen from Buffalo.  I like Karen.  We got Kate from YSP, and we got Taylor from YSP.  Well, start with Karen, representing Buffalo.  Let's go to Karen.  Yeah, Karen.  All right, baby. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, baby.  Wow.  She's nice.  I know my...  Oh, look at that.  With her pimp's jacket.  That is not...  Yeah, look at that.  That's the same fur coat I had when I was in sixth grade.  Is she a black girl with tan lines?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah, some black people, they're able to tan.  They got the tan.  Really hot, man.  Wow, look at her.  She works out and whatnot, huh?  I like the latest contestant from Buffalo, Karen.  I like her. 
[00:14:00]  She's the color of a hushie bar.  She's aight.  Mm-mm.  So, who else do we have?  So, that's from Buffalo.  Then we got two Kates from...  Oh, a Kate and a Taylor from Philadelphia.  Let's see.  Hey, don't make any judgments based on one picture.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Wow, you know something?  She's got some major yabos there.  Look, Ellen DeGeneres' ex-girlfriend.  Nice.  Oh, what's her name?  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Wow, nice girl.  Anne Heche.  Anne Heche.  Yeah, she's got a little Anne Heche in her.  That last picture there, though.  Look at those cans. 
[00:14:30]  Look at those big, huge, natural boobs.  Blush.  Hey, Earl.  Black people could, like, get sunburned and stuff, right?  They get tan, Earl?  Comment.  Earl, question.  Comment.  Because the latest contestant from Buffalo, she's an African princess, and it looks like  she's got tan lines.  As far as I know, no.  What?  You can't.  You know.  I've never...  I've been out in the sun plenty of times.  Yeah, but you're, like, really dark.  And you're not out in the sun.  When are you out in the sun?  You're never out in the sun.  What you're talking about, you need that, you've got to make the extra effort, like going to  a tanning booth or, you know, but look at her. 
[00:15:00]  That back shot, you see a thong, tan line, and everything.  I haven't seen the picture.  So you're talking for every black man, and...  No, I'm not.  And you're saying that black people cannot tan, or...  You're representing the community when you say this?  Or get sunburned?  No, not at all.  Absolutely not.  No?  All right, so...  I don't sunburn.  One of the Philly girls does adult films, we're learning?  Yes, which one.  Which one?  Do we know which one?  Yeah.  All right, well, is it one of the new contestants? 
[00:15:30]  Yes.  No, it's her, then.  Wait, wait, which one?  Which one?  Hold on.  The one we just checked out, right?  From Philly?  So who's telling you that?  Does she want that info known?  Which one?  How do you know?  How do I know?  Get the microphone.  Hey, first one or second one?  Which one?  Contestant 78 does adult films.  How do you know?  How do you know?  I was told by someone anonymously at WISB.  Wow.  And how do they know?  Because I guess she told them.  I bet she does a lot of TF scenes. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, okay.  A lot of TF scenes.  Wow.  Probably Steve knew who she was.  Oh, I know who she is.  Steve, you know who she is?  Steve, how do you know this girl?  She sent me one of the hardcore shots that she's done.  Where is it?  I think it's still on my hard drive.  Well, pop it into my folder over here.  All right, I'll do that.  We've got to take a look, sir.  Well, explain the shot.  Is it in the Bukkake style?  No, no, nothing that.  It's just a hardcore.  Bukkake.  It's a hardcore shot with her.  Is it a slap-happy style shot? 
[00:16:30]  No, no, it's actually very tastefully done.  It's her, another woman, and lower half of a guy.  At least in the shot that I saw.  But she apparently does...  Is she enjoying the guy?  Mmm, yes.  Oh, yeah.  I think about it.  How about that?  All right.  Very tastefully done.  Well, you know, as opposed to slap-happy or, you know...  Yeah, this is a little germy.  Yes.  All right, and let's see the last contestant for a while.  Pop that over, Steve.  And here's...  We'll get a look.  Hey, I like Taylor.  Taylor, contestant number, what, 70... 
[00:17:00]  Taylor?  79.  79.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Yeah, she's got the leg up.  Taylor's all right, too.  Wow, nice.  Man, they messed up with the shots with the shadows.  Yeah.  That wouldn't happen in Sacramento.  Oh, my God.  Look at the shadows.  It's making her look like she's got something going on.  Like, look at here.  Oh, that's the adult film chick?  That's the adult film.  Oh, the girl we thought was the adult film star is not?  Whoops.  Sorry, Kate.  It's number 79.  That's the adult film star. 
[00:17:30]  All right, well...  Wow.  Sorry, Kate.  Perhaps you'd like to get into adult films.  Right now her boyfriend is driving a knife into her.  She sort of had that look, you know?  She kind of had that look.  All right, so it's Taylor.  Taylor.  Contestant number...  Yeah, she had that look.  She had a little skank to her.  Whoa.  In a good way.  A skank?  In a good way.  Let me look and see if I see...  No, I'm not seeing any of that skank.  Go to number 78. 
[00:18:00]  I'm going.  I'm seeing a lot of nice...  See, and look, also, YSP...  The one where she's bending over, kind of, leaning against the chair.  Yeah.  That's horrible because it makes it look like she's got a pot belly because of the way the...  Yeah.  The naughty nightie is hanging.  Yeah.  You can't see the line of her stomach.  Well, we'll see what happens.  Meaty, meaty.  They are very nice breasts she has there.  Yeah.  They've got some weight to them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God. 
[00:18:30]  Now, we can't confirm what this guy's about to say.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  How's it going?  All right.  I used to live in Buffalo, and I actually dated contestant number 77, Cameron.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Absolutely.  Hold on, because I know what you're going to say.  The black chick?  Yeah.  The black chick.  And I dated her for eight months, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  What were you doing in Buffalo?  I was just doing in Buffalo.  I was going to school there, SUNY Buffalo.  Yeah.  Okay, so...  So you saw her pictures on our website and went, oh, my God, I dated a girl?  Right.  Oh, my God, I dated a girl.  But there's an extra twist to it. 
[00:19:00]  Please tell me she's a prostitute.  Oh, no.  She's not a prostitute.  What does she do for a living?  Okay.  She's a secretary.  So I dated her for eight months, right?  Yeah.  Passionate sex every day.  She would not let me hit the front door.  Only the balloon, not every single day.  Are you a white guy?  Oh, front door.  What?  You're a white guy?  Yeah, absolutely.  And she was into white guys?  Absolutely, she was into white guys.  How can we confirm this, Chris?  This is what Chris is saying.  Get her on the phone and answer.  Chris is pretty much saying that contestant number 77...  She's an anal monster.  She's an anal monster.  All anal, all the time. 
[00:19:30]  Did not let me do anything with the front door.  Did not let me do anything.  Wow.  How can we confirm what you're saying, Chris?  Dude, get her on the phone.  If she's listening right now, just get her on the phone and answer.  You're hilarious.  Contestant number 77 has to call us now.  Has to call you up.  You're claiming that she's an anal monster.  Anal monster, dude.  24 hour a day, that's all she wanted.  Was it hygienic, sir?  Or did you ever pull an A-blankin hat on your log?  She was absolutely clean.  We would have these little bath sessions where she would clean out the back door. 
[00:20:00]  She would make it really nice, really like, smells really nice.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, not too much detail.  Oh, sorry.  We're responsible broadcasters.  Okay, I'm sorry.  We're trying to clean up the airways.  Don't you understand that?  I'm a responsible caller, sir.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, so yeah, so she's an anal monster.  So just give her a call, and if she calls up, and I'm telling you, do it.  And another thing is, she's never had this sex in the front door.  That's what she told me.  So she's a virgin, quote, unquote.  Interesting.  Never had the front door sex.  Very interesting.  All right.  Okay, so if she calls, I'll call back so I can talk to her in case she wants to deny it. 
[00:20:30]  Well, you know what?  We're going to get your phone number just in case she calls.  I hope she calls, because, man, she's an anal monster.  We've got to talk so much.  Yeah, I've never heard of an anal monster.  Probably just because he's a white guy, and she wouldn't feel it in the front.  I was kind of thinking the same thing.  Yeah.  You know?  All right.  Okay, let's go to Jeremy.  Jeremy, you're up on Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  Hey, another girl has entered the contest. 
[00:21:00]  Rick, Ben, go to 80.  Oh, I've seen her.  You've seen her, too.  80, the latest contestant from Boston.  Wow.  Hey, wait, is this the one we were looking at earlier?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll go to 80, because we were laughing really hard.  Whoa.  Jeremy, I'll get to you in a second.  Yep.  Contestant number 80, her pictures are up.  Go ahead.  Please tell me.  Oh, he probably can't put the picture up that we saw.  Which one?  Yeah, she had both legs up over her head pinned.  Why couldn't you put that on?  Was she wearing panties?  Oh, no.  She had absolutely nothing on. 
[00:21:30]  Well, where's that shot?  And how did you see it?  Ben's got it.  And you can pretty much see where the baby's come from.  Well.  On the stairs to the garage at BCN.  That's great.  Yeah.  Hey, we know the guys up there at WBCN.  This girl's got to be a little trampy, because they got her in the garage, man.  On the garage.  She's like naked on the stairs to the garage.  She got the tat on her arm like your friend's dad has. 
[00:22:00]  You know?  They got a big...  A lot of black and red on it.  Tat on the arm.  She's all right, though, man.  She's all right.  She's not bad at all.  Yeah.  You got to see the pictures that we can't put up there, because we promised that we wouldn't  show the you-know-what.  Jeremy, what's up?  How much, man?  Hey.  Quick question.  What's going on with the exhibition-only stuff with the Sacramento check? 
[00:22:30]  Here, go back to the Naughty 90 thing there.  All the girls from Sacramento are back in the contest, except for Rena, because those shots  weren't done at the station.  Ah, shit.  But we reinstated everyone.  All right.  Yeah.  I was just checking that out earlier.  And man, the listeners from Sacramento wanted our heads, dude.  Oh, I bet.  We were just trying to do the right thing.  We thought there was some fishy business going on in Sacramento, but we got to the bottom 
[00:23:00]  of it, and all the girls are back in the contest.  Oh, wow.  All right?  Yeah, because I was interested in wondering about that.  I was looking at those pictures from Sacramento, and I was like, this looks like professionally done.  Well, we talked to the girls personally, though, and they're...  Listeners of the show, they went down to the station, and so, hey, hey, hey, easy with  the language.  Good stuff, good stuff.  All right, Jeremy.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  Take it.  Bye.  We were just looking at the Sacramento pictures, me and Norton, and the first picture of Anna  looking through the blinds looks like, I don't know, let me check to see if my daddy's coming 
[00:23:30]  home yet.  You know, doesn't it?  Oh, okay.  We can do it.  I was thinking more of Malcolm X.  Malcolm X?  The famous job ticket of Malcolm X.  All right.  All right, let's take a break, okay?  So there is where we're at with the Naughty Nighting contest.  The latest contestant from Buffalo is an anal monster.  We'll get her on the air, hopefully.  I hope so.  And we're up to 80 contestants.  We were hoping for 100.  It's still possible because we're going to be taking some shots tomorrow live in New 
[00:24:00]  Orleans when we're broadcasting live.  A bunch of girls have promised to come by with their Naughty Nineties.  Tomorrow's the last day to qualify.  Yeah.  The last day to qualify.  As long as we get your pictures by Monday morning, it's cool.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I mean, if you're shooting all day tomorrow at your radio station, it takes the weekend  to get them to us.  That's okay.  We'll put them up Monday morning, okay?  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  You know who we should call today?  Keisha the Virgin.  Oh, yeah.  God, I forgot about that.  Valentine's Day is next week, and we wanted somebody to lose their virginity. 
[00:24:30]  Live on our show.  And we wanted to be her.  And when we were in Philly, Keisha stopped by the station, and she's all for it with this  guy, Greg, she works with.  I got a man.  And she knows where she wants it done and all that.  Somewhere outside of the city there.  What was the name of the...  Oh, the hotel?  Yeah.  God, I can't remember.  It was some, like...  They have a jungle room, though.  Yeah.  Well, let's get Keisha on the...  The Tarzan room.  We'll get Keisha on the phone next and talk to her, see if she's still game to lose her virginity 
[00:25:00]  for Valentine's Day on our radio show, okay?  And don't forget, right after the radio show, we will be flying to New Orleans.  Yeah.  Right after today's show.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Silk.  And thrish.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny. 
[00:25:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A very busy day, Anthony.  Yes.  We've got a lot to do before we leave for New Orleans.  Broadcasting live tomorrow from Bourbon Street.  Marty Grimes.  Did you hear about this quickly?  The MSNBC gaffe.  The mistake, the error graphic that they put up.  When Niger Innes was in. 
[00:26:00]  He's a black guy.  Republican consultant is what he is.  He was being interviewed on MSNBC.  You know what the on-screen graphic said below him for his name?  Nigger Innes.  Instead of the single G, it was the N-I-G-G-R Innes.  And they didn't realize it until it was on the screen.  Where, at that point, if you really think about it, could you see the producer or whoever it is that, right when that pops up looking, going, 
[00:26:30]  Oh, no!  And just the eternity it takes to get it taken care of and remedied.  And then the guy doing the interview has to tell him,  Let me offer my profuse apology from this network.  We accidentally misspelled your name in the last hour, and we are terribly sorry. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  That is a wow.  Ozzy checking in, Anthony.  Hello, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, Ozzy.  What's up?  Ozzy.  You know, man, I was listening to your show, man.  I heard my saw.  I heard your train.  I was just so cool, man.  Yeah, we love when you call the show, Ozzy.  This guy listens to us no matter where he is.  Oh, we love Ozzy.  I even listen to you in my helicopter.  You do?  In your helicopter. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You know, I was watching the Midnight Contest, man.  It's, you know, damn, man.  It's a lot of women, man.  Yeah.  What did he say?  I have no idea.  Oh, yes, Ozzy, of course.  What did you say?  Right.  Yeah.  How is my Jimmy Norton doing?  You are my favorite caller by far.  I love you, too, man.  You know.  Man.  Hey, what about this Ozzy TV thing MTV's doing? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, you know, it's called the Osborns, man.  You know, I think it's March Fit.  I don't know, man.  I'm crazy.  But, you know, it's going on.  I think it should be fun, you know.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Ozzy, where are you calling from today?  Oh, St. James again, man.  Yeah, St. James.  St. James, Long Island.  Long Island.  Yeah, man, you know.  It's so weird when you're not touring and stuff.  You really love that town of St. James.  Oh, you know, it's small, man. 
[00:28:30]  But, you know, it's fun, you know.  It's just not where I picture Ozzy being when he's not on tour.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what do you like about St. James, Ozzy?  Uh, it's small, you know.  It's a great place to make records, you know.  You know, man.  I guess so, Ozzy.  Whatever he's saying, I can't really understand him.  Oh, my God.  I can still hear you, Anthony.  I'm not stupid, you know.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ozzy.  All right, guys, you know, I just want to check in every now and then. 
[00:29:00]  You know, I'll let you guys do your radio show, though.  All right, Ozzy.  Thank you, Ozzy Osbourne.  Why don't you come in and see us live one of these days?  I'd love to, man.  All right.  All right.  There he goes, Ozzy.  Take care, brother.  All right.  Bye.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Huh?  He has every Ozzy-ism down.  Yeah, very good.  Every.  Jim.  Very good.  That's Ozzy.  What are you talking about?  That's why he has it.  Oh, yeah, that must be it.  Make a record.  That's crazy.  A record.  Just play Ozzy talks.  What are you talking about? 
[00:29:30]  It's Ozzy.  Oh, sure.  The Godfather wants to say hi?  Hey, Godfather.  Yo, baby, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  This guy's on before us in Buffalo.  Yeah.  And on after you, too.  Oh, yeah.  On during you.  You have to do a shift after us, too?  Yeah.  Are you serious?  How does that work?  I'm here from three to seven.  Hey, I'm still trying to track down that Karen.  Godfather?  Yeah.  You're confusing everybody.  What?  You do a show before us in Buffalo, right? 
[00:30:00]  Well, I do a midday show.  All right.  I don't do a show.  I'm here running the board.  Well, you're on it.  And then what about at seven?  No.  Oh, God, no.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Okay.  No, no, no, no, no.  So you're trying to hunt down the anal monster?  Yeah, we're trying to get Holy Karen.  I called a number.  Who took her pictures?  It wasn't me.  This is one of them stories where she came up with some guy.  It probably was her pimp.  I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  But she says, you don't mind if he takes my pictures out of the station, do you?  And I said, I guess not.  But then, you know, yesterday we hear all that flap from Sacramento about who did what with the pictures, when and where.  So I haven't seen them yet.  Do they look professionally done?  Let's go back to a contestant number.  What number is she again?  She's 73 or something.  Now, where were these taken?  I don't know.  It wasn't in our studio.  It was somewhere else.  And did you give them signs?  Yes.  All right.  That's not as bad. 
[00:31:00]  Yes, that we did do.  Ah, I don't know.  That we did do.  All right.  So we're, hmm.  But it looks like a radio station.  They put the signs up in the background.  Yeah.  That's about it, though.  It's probably in her bedroom or something.  It's done in a studio or something.  Yeah, it looks like the studio, doesn't it?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, no, we gave her the signs.  Uh-oh.  And then they, you know, she claimed the guy she was with.  Oh, he's a great photographer and yada, yada.  He knows how to shoot me, yada, yada.  Oh, boy.  So anyway, I got a number that she had left us and called that number. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And it was confusing.  People answered the phone.  No, she's not here.  But I got another number.  And then the number they gave me, I called.  And you must have the wrong number.  There's no Karen here.  Ah.  I don't know what's going on.  Karen, if you're listening, you better call and get yourself out of this deep hole you're in.  Something's up with the contestant from Buffalo, Karen.  That could be.  But that was funny when that guy called and said he was going out with her for eight months.  And she's an anal monster.  And she's an anal monster.  That was even funnier.  We want to find out if that's the truth.  Oh, my God.  We need to know. 
[00:32:00]  We need to know.  Now, I saw her when she came into the studio.  She was a fine-looking woman, though.  You can tell by the shots.  Oh, yeah.  She had that fur coat on, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  She was looking nice.  Well, the guy said she's a secretary or something.  Is she?  Bad pimp.  Bad pimp.  She should be dancing with a body like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, write this down, honey.  Write this down.  Well, I mean, secretary or stripper, what would you pick?  I'd say stripper.  Yeah, we'd go with the stripper.  Especially if you've got the boobs like her.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Godfather. 
[00:32:30]  All right, dude.  Have fun in New Orleans.  Yeah, we will.  Thank you.  We'll put you back in a hole if someone wants to say something to you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Very good.  So there's the Shadow Stevens.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up today?  Guys, what's up?  Hey.  First of all, I just want to say that this has to be the greatest radio promotion of all time.  Oh, we're trying.  It's a good one.  God bless syndication.  I mean, you guys said we've had some other contests, you know, the booby contest. 
[00:33:00]  I got to tell you, a lot of people in the New York area are very pissed off when they found out  and I were going to be syndicated.  This is the plus side right here.  Right.  You get to see the talent in other cities when we do these internet contests.  Major pluses.  You know?  Now, there's only...  Who doesn't want to move to Sacramento at this point?  I know.  Who knew there were so many supermodels walking around?  I am pounding this website on a daily basis.  Pounding.  Isn't it so exciting when, like, the new girls come up?  Yeah.  But you guys are talking about this girl, Karen.  She's not up yet.  You're up to 76 on the website. 
[00:33:30]  No, no, my friend.  You got to refresh.  Refresh.  All right, I will.  Empty your cash.  You must refresh.  Oh, I got it.  Yep.  Okay, I got it.  There you go.  All right, cool.  Oh, and some new pictures of the porn star, though.  Thank you, guys.  And her second outfit because it's the same batch.  Who is going to be part of the esteemed panel who picks the finalists?  You guys are.  No, don't.  The finalists.  You guys are picking the finalists or we are?  No, we're going to have two sets of votes because we have so many girls.  We're going to try to narrow it down to...  Wow!  That's the porn star?  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, right.  They messed up with the second outfit shots of the porn star and what number?  She's 79, I think?  Yeah.  And they got the real shots up now.  Man!  That's great.  Billy.  I like that.  Billy coming off strong in the end.  Like that rib cage in the last picture.  Just get your hands around there.  I think we're going to have two sets of votes there, Mike.  One to just narrow it down to like the top 20.  Cool.  And then finally, you know, then we'll just have a week of voting and figure out who the 
[00:34:30]  winner is.  Cool.  We'll have all the details on Monday.  All right.  Quick question.  Yes.  How about for spring break?  Because spring break's coming up.  We have a wet t-shirt contest.  Eh.  Just an idea.  Eh.  Eh.  Been done a million times.  Yeah.  But not on the web.  Maybe we could put our own O&A spin onto it.  Who knows?  All right.  Yeah.  We'll keep it in consideration.  Love you guys.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  Do it your own way.  Like instead of water, you use gasoline.  And they're smoking.  You say that so casual. 
[00:35:00]  Like, yeah, that's what we do.  All right.  We're a little preoccupied because we have to fly tonight.  That's all right.  Not for me.  Opie hasn't taken to the air.  No.  No.  And quite a while.  How long?  Where was the last place you went?  I flew home from Athens.  From Athens, Greece.  Uh, literally two days before 9-11.  Oh.  All right.  That was a little too close for me to handle. 
[00:35:30]  Well.  And I hate flying to begin with.  And this has put it in a whole freaking new level.  That's good.  I'm stuck sitting next to you, too.  That's going to be nice.  Oh, in first class.  Well, you know, yeah.  Just two men sitting in the front of the plane making plans.  I wouldn't worry about it there, trooper.  I think it's the security at the airport that's most annoying.  Well.  And then once you get on the plane, you're so exhausted from the security and everything else. 
[00:36:00]  And trying not to look suspicious.  And trying to remember if you left nail clippers in your carry-on bag and things like that.  You feel relieved when you're on the plane.  Can I get my Game Boy Advance on the flight?  Yes.  They won't take that away from me, will they?  I got my DVD player all ready to go.  All charged up with my Honeymooners collection.  So I'm just going to be sitting watching Honeymooners the whole time.  Can I have fun?  That's great.  Fun, fun, fun.  I'll be reading my Kurt Cobain book and playing some Game Boy Advance. 
[00:36:30]  Ah, there you go.  What did you get for your Game Boy?  I got...  You know what?  You suck, by the way.  Why?  Because you told me they had a good selection at Comp USA.  I said, yeah, they did.  They really had...  You know something?  I'm sorry, but when I go in there, I'm really not looking for the Game Boy things.  But they got everything else, so I just assumed that they would have...  Before I tell you what I got, to my defense, they had nothing on the wall.  They didn't.  They really had nothing.  They had John Madden football, but on Game Boy Advance, I'm thinking it's not going to 
[00:37:00]  be anywhere as near when you play it on Xbox or PlayStation 2.  Well, nothing is, really.  You've got to kind of compromise with them.  And then they had some racing car games, which I hate, especially on the small Game Boy  Advance.  So I had to settle for Frogger.  Like the latest version of Frogger.  The latest?  Frogger 3D, is it?  Or something like that?  Frogger's Temple of...  I don't know.  Is he still jumping across the street, trying to miss those trucks and cars?  No, they update a little bit. 
[00:37:30]  No, yeah?  You jump on logs and stuff, too.  Ah, there you go.  You know.  That sounds great.  Jump on moving clouds.  You know, they updated the game.  That sounds fun.  I'm not happy, Jim.  That'll...  It shouldn't be.  That'll stay interesting for three and a half hours.  When we were on South Street in Philly, local reference, bing, bing, bing, we went into  one of the shops down there, and it was a whole wall of Game Boy Advance games.  Why don't you pick them up?  I did.  But I'm already bored with those games.  Ah.  I got a golf game, an ESPN golf game that I just...  That's pretty good.  I ripped right through it, though. 
[00:38:00]  Killed the game.  But you sent me to Compute USA.  They had, like, seven games.  You know why?  Because they have a huge selection as far as PC games go and whatnot, so...  Oh, well.  I screwed up there.  What can I say?  All right.  Who's on the line?  Oh, Tony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I wanted to know how you guys got airfare and a hotel to go for your trip to New Orleans.  Wow.  Good call.  Good call back.  What was it?  30.5 miles an hour? 
[00:38:30]  That's funny, Tony.  Yeah, when we give out prizes to our listeners, we only have tickets, and we don't have airfare  or hotels, but when we go somewhere, we're well taken care of.  All right.  You called us out on it, Tony.  Good job.  That's good.  You dick.  You dick.  Yeah, well.  And incidentally, I'm really annoyed.  It's so...  Hold on, Keisha.  The nerve of Hillary Clinton to be doing stand-up.  What is she doing?  Stand-up.  She did a little stand-up.  Ah, she was being funny.  Yeah.  A few chuckles.  I'd love to write for her. 
[00:39:00]  Funny thing happened to me.  On the way over here, a bum said, I haven't had a bite in three days, so I grew fat calves  and ate a box.  Stop doing stand-up.  You're not funny.  And I'm sure the place just burst into laughter like Eddie Murphy was doing delirious.  I'm sure.  Just hysterical.  Yeah, just laughed appropriately and clapped.  Oh, you know, let me tell you about Bill.  Oh, she has a part in the middle, Clep. 
[00:39:30]  When I was in the White House, he was getting his junk socked on a daily basis.  With her Washington phony speech.  We need more money for the city of New York to recover from this horrible thing that has  happened.  Shut up!  Stop yelling.  Talk like a human being.  Hey, Keisha's on the line, Anthony.  Keisha?  Keisha the Virgin.  Here I go. 
[00:40:00]  What's up, Keisha?  Mr. Dill.  Mr. Dill, yo.  We enjoyed meeting you in Philly.  You did have me standing out there while y'all had them boochies in there.  Yeah, oh, that's right.  I forgot you's the one that talked like D.  I like you.  We like your voice.  You like my voice?  Yeah, you like that, what was her name?  She had that sitcom.  Jackie?  Ah, Jackie.  Jackie.  You like Jackie.  Oh, I'm like Jackie.  You like Jackie.  There's this black and white thing going on that we should discuss, Anthony.  What black and white thing? 
[00:40:30]  There's the contestant.  That's one of our contestants?  That's the point star one.  Look at her grab.  Oh, my God.  Look at her grabbing that hog.  You want to explain?  Where?  That's great.  Well, Taylor, one of our contestants from Philly.  From Philly.  Uh-huh.  What number, Ann?  The listeners like numbers.  Yeah.  They really enjoy when you just say contestant number.  Number, right.  Right.  I think it's 79, maybe? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, one of the new ones.  Damn it, I can't find that.  All right.  79, go ahead.  79.  Contestant number 79, we found out, is a porn star.  Yeah.  And Steve has sent Anthony some of her shots.  Some of her work.  And, man, she's got good technique.  Yeah, she's grazing the absolute perfect spot on the man junk with the side of her tongue there.  And then in this one, it's a shot of her being shot, let's say. 
[00:41:30]  Right in the face.  Let me see you, Ann.  Wow.  The one with the blackout under her eyes.  Is there a place where our listeners could go to see contestant number 79 in action?  Well, it would be nice if Steve could.  No, not yet.  No, not yet.  Can't put hardcore pornography like that up?  I can see what I can do about getting that shot up, but there's no website, at least not yet.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  If it's possible, Steve will make it happen on foundrymusic.com. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Back to you, Keisha.  Uh-huh.  So are you still game?  Am I still what?  Game.  First of all, are you still a virgin?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what the Ben brought me out.  You what?  That's what the Ben took me out.  You know what I mean?  I don't understand that word.  You're supposed to have taken her out already.  Oh.  Is that what you're saying, Keisha?  Yeah.  All right.  Who's supposed to take you out?  Greg?  Yeah.  Yeah, Greg's the guy that's going to bang you, right?  Yeah.  He hasn't backed down, right? 
[00:42:30]  No, he's still right here.  Oh, he's right there right now?  Yep.  And, all right.  What hotel did you want us to...  I said the end of the dove.  End of the dove.  Yeah.  You are jacked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  When do you want to get this done?  Um, right now I'm about to leave work.  Yeah.  We, um...  Can't you guys call me later and, like, hook up somewhere for us to go?  What?  On a date, you know? 
[00:43:00]  Um, yeah.  Well, how do you want this to go down?  It's your virginity, man.  I'm saying we told you already before.  We want a little bit of, you know what I mean, cristal.  We'll get the cristal.  Yeah.  We got some rose petals.  You know what I mean?  All across that bed.  I want a jacuzzi up in my room.  Yeah.  I've been a size.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got the rose petals.  You got the cristal.  You know.  Goddamn, man.  It was disgusting or something in the back office.  Obviously, she's black.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you mean it's obvious I'm black?  You're not black.  It was, uh... 
[00:43:30]  No, we know that.  But I was watching 2020 Downtown and they were amazed at the fact that some people are identifying  people's race over the phone.  Like, you could tell if it's somebody who's black or white over the phone.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And it's like, no crap.  Who hasn't done that before?  You hear Keisha talking on the phone, you're going to know that she's a black girl.  I'm not thinking Irish or Italian or anything.  Right.  We actually tried this out once and we were perfect.  We had people just randomly calling us and we were able to tell if they were black or white. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Just by their voice.  Well, and a few questions.  Yeah.  Well, guys, you want to call me on my cell phone?  Because I really have to leave work now.  All right.  Yeah.  Rick will be in touch with you.  We're going to make this happen next week.  Okay?  All right.  We got the cristal.  We got the...  Rose petals.  Rose petals.  Yeah, me.  We got the benefits.  You got the benefits.  Yeah.  And we got the white dove in or whatever it's called.  Into the dove.  Into the dove.  White dove.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a line.  Rick's going to talk to you. 
[00:44:30]  Okay?  Okay.  We have to make this happen next week.  Okay.  Preferably on Valentine's Day.  Preferably on Valentine's Day.  I'm going to talk to my boss tomorrow because right now she's not here and I'm about to leave.  So I'll make sure I'll talk to her tomorrow and see if I can get off.  And I'll call you guys back tomorrow and let you know the deal.  All right.  The deal.  The deal.  I want to know the deal.  All right.  All right.  Kisha, we love you, man, for doing that.  I love you too, boo.  You're going to be.  Don't say the word boo.  We don't like the word boo.  What's wrong with the word boo?  It's just a stupid word. 
[00:45:00]  It's a stupid word.  What does boo mean?  Boo mean, baby, I mean, I'm feeling you, sweetie, something like that.  What's up, Earl?  Earl, talk to the sister.  All right.  What?  What?  Earl, you have no rap whatsoever.  I'm black.  I'm blacker than you.  I know what boo means.  So is boo a black term?  Kisha, this is allegedly black Earl.  He's allegedly black.  Barely, barely black Earl. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, Earl, you have nothing.  No, I'm Keisha.  Earl, you're terrible.  No, I know what boo means.  It means like, it means like, yo, baby.  I don't like it.  Yo, babe.  Kisha uses the word all the time and I don't like it.  That's right.  Well, who are you to tell me what I can and can't use?  Yeah.  Yeah, kid.  Yeah.  I got the cheddar.  You got that cheddar?  I got some cheddar.  Well, y'all need to get me the cheddar because I've been on the air about a couple times.  Earl doesn't have the cheddar.  Look at him.  What? 
[00:46:00]  Yo, it's crazy.  Uppity boo?  What's an uppity boo, Earl?  I just made it up.  I'm sorry.  Wow, you're just hilarious.  Uppity.  Earl will be at the Comedy Cellar tonight trying out his new materials.  Uppity boo.  They're laughing at you, Earl, not me.  All right, Kisha, hold on for Rick, okay?  All right.  All right.  Rick, talk to her.  Jeez, there's a website from that girl that gives the BJs at Mardi Gras. 
[00:46:30]  I'm checking out.  She also does Super Bowl Slut Day where she'll go over, I guess, somewhere.  She appears to be at some guy's house here with all the people over to watch the Super Bowl.  She dresses in a slutty outfit, serves them beers and munchies and whatnot,  and then the guys fill out the pool.  And if you win the pool for the quarters, she gives you a Hummer.  God damn.  And at the end, they all get to gangbang her. 
[00:47:00]  Is there pictures?  Well, here she is giving a prize to one of the gentlemen that just won the pool.  That must be the first quarter winner.  Won the pool.  That's the first quarter winner.  And then we'll go check out this picture from another lucky winner of the pool.  There she is.  And look, she's...  Hold on.  All right, I have a problem with this picture.  I was just going to say that.  Okay.  Because it looks like an average Super Bowl party that most of us have went to this past Super Bowl.  You've got your friends over, and your friends bring their girlfriend. 
[00:47:30]  I see a couple that look like maybe they could be an aunt or an uncle.  They're all eating their little, I don't know, rigatoni.  Yeah.  They've got their little beer and stuff, and they're sitting on, like, you know, the bricks that line the fireplace.  Sure.  You know, and in the foreground is, what's her name?  The Super Bowl slut.  Yeah.  She's taking care of this guy who's completely naked, but the people in the background look  way too normal to be involved in that scene.  They're just sitting there watching TV.  Who's girlfriend is that?  Just sitting there going, oh, yeah, well... 
[00:48:00]  She's just sitting there.  This is what my man and his friends do.  And then, uh...  I accept it.  Go ahead.  It's got to be great at the Super Bowl party, though.  I'll take the Rams and chlamydia.  Oh, that must have been this guy's girlfriend, because look at her now.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  The other girl's getting involved, but there's the gangbang at the end of the game.  One of the brothers...  They're all superimposed.  One of the homeboys getting a ride there, huh?  Look at that.  Mandingo.  Jesus. 
[00:48:30]  Let's go to D.  D, what's up?  D.  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I was wondering how Keisha knew about End of the Thug, man.  This hotel is really sleazy.  They got whirlpools, mirrors on the ceiling.  I was wondering why a virgin would want to go there.  They used to make porn videos in this place.  It's down by Atlantic City.  You're saying it's a sex palace, right?  It's a sex palace.  Well, Keisha wants to be in the jungle room.  I guess they have a jungle room.  I never saw that, but I was spreading good there 15 years ago, man.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[00:49:00]  Keisha's losing her virginity next week.  We can't wait.  Good place to lose it, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Good deal.  Good day, bro.  Bye.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, kid.  Hey, Nate.  Nate checking in from Dallas.  We don't hear from Dallas too often.  Hold on one second, Nate.  All right.  Adam from Manhattan.  I don't know who's harder to understand, Keisha or Ozzy?  Go ahead, Nate.  Hey, what's going on?  Y'all, how y'all doing?  It's an honor to speak to y'all finally, dude. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  All right, sir.  There's no honor involved.  That's what it is.  What's up?  Nah, dude.  I'm just saying I'm trying to make it over.  I might take the trip to New Orleans to see y'all tomorrow.  It says on the screen you're going to drive six hours just to check out the show live from Bourbon Street tomorrow.  Man, I'm hoping to.  I got school Saturday, though.  We encourage a lot of people to come see us in New Orleans tomorrow.  I'm hoping there's going to be a place where our listeners can hang out.  Man, if not, my dad's an airline pilot.  Maybe I can fly up there to see y'all or something, man.  But I love listening. 
[00:50:00]  Y'all, the only thing that sucks, the eight-hour delay, man.  Yeah, well, we're working on some of those problems.  All right, man.  The guy in y'all's place got a mad dude.  Dude's rolling a bullet.  He's got the 1090 kicking.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  All right, Nate.  What?  Y'all take care.  Y'all suck.  All right, we'll see them off.  We should take a break because we have Brian Regan on hold.  He wants to talk to us.  Hey, I was just looking at the free beads woman from Mardi Gras,  and there she is just hobbing away. 
[00:50:30]  All right, we'll be back with Brian Regan now.  All right.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opin' Anthony F.U. line.  That dumb, dumb, dumb ass Mark from Cleveland for thinking  that the president was really on the O&E show.  F*** him.  F*** him.  What a freaking dumbass.  Are all P-Boy Cleveland not dumb?  I think they are.  Next message. 
[00:51:00]  Big F.U. goes after 14-year-old Gary,  trying to steal 12-year-old Gary's thunder like that.  48-year-old Gary, all right, keeping it real.  12-year-old Gary, well, they're going to be 14 someday.  Next message.  Hey, this is a big f*** you from Sacramento to all you East Coast haters  getting us kicked out of the contest.  Hey, f*** you.  What do you guys like looking at, fat chicks?  F*** you, faggots.  End of message.  Yeah, we're back with the O&E show.  Oh, boy, a dilemma. 
[00:51:30]  Got a little dilemma here.  What's the matter?  Brian Regan on line six.  Oh, no.  And the BJ girl on line seven from New Orleans.  Oh, boy, what to do, what to do.  Oh, come on.  Stop.  Who do we care about more?  Well, we...  Our buddy, our pal, Brian Regan.  We do enjoy the Brian Regan.  Who's been a friend of the show ever since we moved to New York  or back to New York.  We do enjoy the Brian Regan.  Or do we talk to the BJ girl? 
[00:52:00]  Brian?  Yes?  We have a little problem here.  I hear you, man.  I don't think I can compete with a BJ girl.  Yes?  I had my money on you connecting over to her.  How about...  Hold on.  I know.  What?  There's a solution here, Brian.  Brian, you're in town this weekend?  I'm in Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday. 
[00:52:30]  And we're not going to be around.  You know that, right?  I know.  Where are you guys?  New Orleans?  Yeah, going to Mardi Gras.  Man.  You guys are rocking and rolling.  Oh, it's going to be insane.  All right.  Hold on.  We're going to put you on with the BJ girl.  We're going to try to accomplish two things here.  This is...  If you know Brian Regan's humor, this is all conducive to this.  Hey, BJ girl.  Yeah.  Hi, you're on with Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and Brian Regan.  Thanks. 
[00:53:00]  Brian Regan, a very funny guy.  He's playing Bananas.  Brian?  Yeah, Bananas.  I have a short-term memory problem.  That's right.  Goldfish?  And I'm talking to who?  She swallows Bananas.  So there you go.  We got a nice, real comfortable tie-in here.  Yeah.  That's a nice tie-in.  Both have something to do with Bananas.  Your name is Alicious?  It's Oasis.  Oh, Oasis.  Yeah.  What the hell was that?  Oasis.  What is it?  No, no, no.  I'm talking about here.  You're spelt like Alicious. 
[00:53:30]  No, it's Oasis.  All right, Oasis.  And you are the girl that we have seen given hummers at Mardi Gras?  No, I'm the girl that's...  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're going to dump out of them.  Yeah, you know what it is?  The B and the J word?  Yeah, we can't use that on the air.  For some reason, they're all stuck-up bastards here, and the Pope is working the dump button.  Okay, it says free BJs on the back.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many years have you been fighting to control this childhood abuse that you obviously suffered? 
[00:54:00]  We've been having...  The website's been up for almost six years.  Now, you go to Mardi Gras.  Yes.  And you put this shirt on.  Uh-huh.  And you just give out free BJs.  Well, see, this shirt is for slut day.  We do this thing every month called slut day.  Every month?  Uh-huh.  And what is slut day?  Pretty much, I have to be a slut.  And I just do all sorts of crazy things.  Yeah?  How old a gal are you?  Um, almost 31.  Yeah? 
[00:54:30]  And you've been doing this for six years, I guess?  Uh-huh.  And what do you do this for?  We have a website.  So we take pictures and stuff on the website.  Brian, Brian.  That explains everything.  Hey, Brian.  You've got a website, you've got to promo it, you know?  Yeah, Brian's like, oh.  Hey, Brian, you can relate to slut day, right?  Well, it's interesting because at Bananas, Friday and Saturday are both slut night.  What?  No, I don't get this.  So you go down there.  What criteria does a guy have to have? 
[00:55:00]  Like, you're down there, Mardi Gras.  You're wearing the shirt.  A guy comes up to you and says, hey, I'll take one.  And all of a sudden, you just go to town.  Well, it depends.  He's got to be cute.  Oh, okay.  It's not just, you know.  I have to be attracted to him.  Thank God, slut girl has morals.  Yeah.  Thank God you're not just hobbing anything.  You've got to take like a three-second gander at somebody.  Right.  That's right.  And then do you let him finish?  Make sure there's no bumps.  Not usually.  It depends.  It's pretty hard for a guy to finish in a bar.  Yeah, you think so, huh? 
[00:55:30]  Put a bunch of people around.  It has happened.  Oh, it has.  Hey, Brian, do you have that problem finishing with slut girl at the bar?  I think no matter if I say yes or no, I run into a problem area.  Hey, are we going to be able to get you to the show tomorrow?  Yeah, I'll come down there tomorrow.  You'll come down there?  Yes.  Do you think we'll get a listener and you could give them one?  Sure.  All right.  A lucky listener that wants to join us at the Opie and Anthony show?  It looks like Brian Regan will be flying down to New Orleans. 
[00:56:00]  He just canceled his gigs at Bananas in...  Where's Bananas, Brian?  Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  Oh, yeah.  I'm changing my flight as we speak.  Yeah.  It'll be slut girl.  And Regan.  Yeah.  Slut girl and Regan.  Big yellow ones.  Hepatitis.  That'd be cool.  I'll take the pictures and put them on my website.  Great.  Hey, so I've got to ask this.  What do the authorities think down there when you're doing your little thing?  No one really cares.  No one cares.  It's all in good fun.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:56:30]  So you could guarantee one of these things to one of our listeners tomorrow?  Just about.  Look at that, eh?  It's never a total guarantee, but it's a pretty good bet.  What a great prize.  What other radio show gives you Hummers?  We're going to get you Hummers, I should say.  Yeah, hello.  Pretty Freudian, you know.  Wow.  Yeah, we're not going to give it to you.  Wow, that's not good.  Yeah, what other radio show gets you Hummers?  Yeah, that's going to be great for a listener that comes down.  That was really bad.  Yeah.  Welcome to the...  Well, well, I can't wait to meet you tomorrow. 
[00:57:00]  Now, she should explain what happened at the Super Bowl party.  Yeah, is that you at the Super Bowl?  We had a party in Dallas for the Super Bowl.  We have an annual Super Bowl gangbang.  Yeah, isn't that the party where the guys enter a pool and every quarter you give a BJ to one of them?  Yeah, we did that, too.  Brian, have you ever...  Well, like one of those big square last-digit pools?  I had Johnny Race handing out Jell-O shots while this is going on. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, Brian, that's pretty much.  You buy a square and instead of winning the cash, you'll come up and hob the knob for you.  Are you guys looking at my website right now?  Yeah, as a matter of fact, I don't want to give it out right away because we still want to look at it,  but we'll give it out a little later.  Okay.  So you got guys, like, just sitting there going, I just need three more safeties.  And actually...  Three more safeties.  Let me start working it.  Is that a picture of you sitting at the bar, naked, drinking a beer?  Yep, that's me.  That's a bar in Louisiana. 
[00:58:00]  That's her right there.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  She's got, like, a real slutty look to her there.  Yeah, you're pretty hot for a skank.  I like that.  Well, thanks.  You know, I don't have my webpage up and running yet, but is this how you promo it?  Well, yeah, Brian.  I got to work on my marketing skills.  Yeah, you got to be Slut Boy every once in a while.  Slut Boy once a month.  Wow, who's this chick?  She's kind of...  Well, she's a lappin'.  She's a lappin'?  One girl down there a lappin', and there's you wearing the slut shirt. 
[00:58:30]  It could be one of any bunches of chicks.  I don't know.  Yeah.  A lot of black guys coming on to you, huh?  Yeah.  Black guys like my butt.  They do, huh?  Yeah.  You, uh...  Wow, that's...  Well, she got a little junk in the trunk.  You got some junk in the trunk, dude?  I got a nice butt.  Do you ever bang guys?  Do I ever bang them?  Yeah.  Sure I do.  Oh, good girl.  Yeah, of course.  Hey, uh, well hung, who, uh...  Oh, my God.  Here she is sitting somewhere drinking a beer.  Her skirt's hiked up.  She's just got her legs all akimbo. 
[00:59:00]  Look at that.  That's you.  Akimbo.  Yeah.  Hey, it seems like you like to drink, too, huh?  Like every shot I see, she's naked and drinking.  Every picture you describe her as a beer bottle is.  Yeah.  She likes beer and drinking from the mule.  I'm trying to get to this last picture.  It looks like she's drinking something else.  Ooh.  Not quite a...  I'm trying to get to that.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:59:30]  She's working two at a time, Opie.  Look.  Two at a time.  I love her.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Very talented.  Thank you.  You're going to town.  Guys like your technique and everything?  Oh, yeah.  I practice a lot.  Yeah, I guess so.  Giving out free ones.  Brian practices a lot on his comedy.  On his comedy.  And look how good Brian is.  See?  Practice does make perfect.  That's right.  I've got to get on a different career path, I guess.  Look at that.  Brian and BJ and Oasis are both going to be working bananas tomorrow. 
[01:00:00]  There you go.  All right.  Hold on.  Well Hung wants in on this.  Where am I going here?  Well Hung has information on Oasis.  Well Hung.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, man.  Have you seen this chick on her website in the shorts?  Yeah.  It's cute.  Her slot is huge.  I like that, though.  You could land a plane in that thing.  Yeah, I must say.  Yeah, Oasis?  Yeah.  Have you had a few kids or a few hundred guys?  What's the deal here?  More like a few hundred guys.  Yeah.  How many would you say? 
[01:00:30]  Actually, I have a scoreboard on the site.  And if you look at it, it'll tell you exactly how many.  Hey, Brian, you don't have a scoreboard.  No, I don't have a scoreboard.  I hope I got the right site here.  Rick, do you have the site?  Yeah.  Okay.  Is that the right site?  Is it?  Rick?  Oh, you mean her original site?  Yeah, I'm looking for her site.  Okay.  I'll type it in.  You type it in, and I'll look at the scoreboard and everything.  Yeah, what's the scoreboard thing all about?  Is it like the Jerry Lewis telethon where they go,  now let's take another look at the tote board?  The tote board. 
[01:01:00]  Jerry!  It does keep in track of all the partners we've had on the website.  How many BJs have you given, Jerry?  Take a look.  Is it over a million?  Ho, ho, ho.  I actually just did, I think on my BJs, I'm at 200 and something.  Really?  260 something.  And how many?  It's for pictures for the site.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, we can't wait to check you out tomorrow.  Okay, that'll be fun.  And one of our listeners will get you know what from you. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  Are we done with Oasis, then?  Until tomorrow.  Yes, Oasis.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  What time do you want us to come down there?  When the show starts.  Two o'clock.  Two o'clock New Orleans time.  All right.  Y'all be there.  Or when you come, we'll call it Tuak.  Ah.  All right.  Thank you, Oasis.  Okay, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm trying to look for the...  There you go.  Homer girl.  The scoreboard.  I can't quite find it. 
[01:02:00]  Would it foundry music design this site?  Jesus.  It's awful.  I can't get anywhere.  Let's see.  Slut day, parties, gallery, my bio.  Hey, this just in.  Oasis is going to be the new sales girl here at WNEW.  I'll suck it.  Oh, I wish.  How you doing?  It's okay.  I'll suck it.  Push harder.  There's more room.  Do me in the dirty spot.  And Brian Regan doesn't like this type of humor.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  What is it?  Slut day?  Okay.  I'm clicking on slut day.  See, Steve, she's helping me out here.  Slut day.  Oh, here's the current scoreboard to prove what a good slut I am.  We're going to link this to foundrymusic.com.  Go ahead.  All right.  The Oasis scoreboard, current men.  She has F'd and sucked.  No way.  Turn this around.  She is just ready to break the 100 mark on the men F'd.  Wow, maybe one of our listeners could be lucky number 100. 
[01:03:00]  And the sucked, we have $2.59 on that.  What's the counter for candlelight dinners?  Two.  She's got five Brian Regan shows attended here, though, so she seems to be a fan.  Hey, that's cool, man.  This says updated January 25th, so I'm sure she's past the 100 mark.  She's well over 100.  Those are all up at higher levels now.  Especially with Mardi Gras happening right now.  These numbers do not reflect the number of men I have personally been with, 
[01:03:30]  but instead represent the number I have been with in front of a camera.  Oh.  It doesn't also represent the number of times I have F'd or S'd.  It is the number of men I have been with.  Wow.  For each guy I F'd and or S'd, there may be several,  sometimes as much as 100 photos.  I may have F'd and S'd them each many times. 
[01:04:00]  If I try to count how many times I've actually F'd or given Hummers,  I'd need a supercomputer.  Supercomputer.  Using 50s terminology for computers.  It's a supercomputer.  We're just destroying the asteroid with our supercomputer.  We have a supercomputer.  These numbers may be on the low side because it's hard to count each and every person involved in a gangbang.  Well, that's true.  On the count for Hummers, I counted licking or sucking. 
[01:04:30]  Both, I guess.  I don't know what you're saying.  That's why you've got to have a governing body involved with these kind of things.  Right, you know?  Because who's to say if these numbers are authentic?  Exactly.  You know?  To get us to the world record, they keep very tight controls on such things.  A governing body.  You know what they should have?  They should have a count like the F'd and then Suck'd and then a T-cell count.  And as the other two go up, that drops. 
[01:05:00]  That drops down to nothing.  You see the grass like crossing at a certain point.  Yes.  Oh, man.  Unbelievable that she's going to be on the show tomorrow.  Yes.  Who can wait for that?  Al calling in from New Orleans.  What's up, Al?  Hey, man.  Hook me up.  I'll be the contestant.  You're coming by tomorrow?  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  One of our lucky listeners will be getting service tomorrow.  In one of our newest cities, too.  New Orleans.  I've been listening since the first day.  Cool.  Well, what do they have to do to win the prize? 
[01:05:30]  Well, we're going to have to come up with some, Brian.  I think the fact that he just called in and said he's the contestant is going to know, right?  Well, yeah.  Pretty much usually, yeah.  We might have to come up with some creative for tomorrow.  Okay.  Well, think about it on the plane tonight.  Look at some of these.  Slut Day and Week, she has.  She has Exhibitionism.  And then Oasis, the, you know, C-U, and then another letter, Slut.  And then she has C-U, and then another letter, Crazy Amateurs. 
[01:06:00]  My Parties, which are unlike any parties I ever go to.  Yeah.  Wow, this chick is a real deal.  Anthony, what a coincidence, but we have Boob Man on line eight.  He fills up girls, and it's free.  Look at that, huh?  Hey, Jack, what's up?  What a guy.  Hey, Jack, you're Boob Man.  Yeah, I figured, you know, I'd go along with that promotion.  I will elect girls.  I will allow girls to let me touch their boobs. 
[01:06:30]  Wow, you're really going out on a limb.  I figure, you know, if she's going to give out BJs, I might as well allow my, you know,  send my services out just as well.  You know, if we were to count all the guys that would want to do that, we'd need a supercomputer.  It doesn't seem like something a lot of guys wouldn't want to do.  The thing would start smoking, right, and shooting sparks.  Yeah.  The supercomputer cannot handle the numbers.  Does not compute.  Does not compute.  Overload.  Overload, Dr. Smith.  Danger.  Supercomputer. 
[01:07:00]  Warning.  My tubes are ready to explode on my supercomputer.  We are up over 50.  50.  No, I don't even know what that is.  It's a critical number.  Classic.  Classic.  We've hit critical mass.  Everyone is saying for, you know, to give out the website.  Yeah.  Give us the goddamn site already, Big Tom saying.  It's www, of course, dot, um,  C-U, and then you need a third letter that I am not going to give out. 
[01:07:30]  You get it?  Opie, you are looking like you don't know what I'm talking about.  www.cu.  If you said a third letter and a fourth letter, I would understand.  No, it's spelled C-U and then the third letter.  It could be any one of 26 letters.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Right.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Not the, uh, unt word.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Is it how Ricky Ricardo says, I can't hear you?  No, no, no. 
[01:08:00]  It's, it's, if I were to say, hey, come here.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know, that is spelled C-O-M-E.  Right.  There's another way to spell that that we can't do on the air.  Well, normally I don't see that word in print, Anthony.  I apologize.  So it's www.cu, and then that third letter.  Oh, oh, oh.  The number two.  Hey, Jim, can I ask you a question?  Oasis.  www.cu, that third letter.  Then the number two, oasis.com.  You got it? 
[01:08:30]  And we'll be linked, uh, we'll be linking that to Foundry.  That's great.  Make a website that you can't even say on the radio.  I know.  You'd think someone picked, like, Eat a Bullet or something, which is so easy.  Oh, eatabullet.com, which is, uh, Jim Norton's, uh, fine site that you, you won't find pornography on, but what's on that site?  Nothing but pictures of me and my fat kidney bean head.  It's worth it.  All right, Brian.  Brian.  Yeah.  I'm only sorry that we're not going to be around.  Yeah, we're kind of bummed, you know?  I know, but, uh, I appreciate, uh, you know, the, the chit-chat right now. 
[01:09:00]  Were you guys down there for the Super Bowl as well?  No.  No, we had to make a decision, and I think we chose, uh, wisely on this one.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, uh, you wanna, you wanna call us tomorrow when we're in New Orleans when this girl is doing her thing?  Uh, yeah, sure, man.  All right, hold on a line, because, uh, Rick will get a number, and, uh, we'll try to get you on the show again tomorrow.  That sounds great.  It's, it's just not the same when you, when you're here, sitting here, and, and hanging with us, my friend.  Just imagine, uh, Brian Regan being here during those festivities. 
[01:09:30]  That would just be great.  I'm sitting here eating a rat sandwich as we speak.  Yeah.  All right, well, uh, Brian's playing Bananas.  Hasbrook Heights?  Hasbrook Heights, uh, Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday.  Well, I mean, uh, I think everyone knows by now.  We highly recommend you go see Brian Regan.  That's very cool, guys.  He kills every time he comes to town, so.  I appreciate it so much.  All right, Brian, um, hopefully we'll talk to you tomorrow, all right?  That sounds great, man.  All right, there he goes.  Okay.  Not only does he kill, but he sells out, so call in advance, retards.  There you go.  Bananas.  Hasbrook Heights, Brian Regan, Friday and Saturday. 
[01:10:00]  All right, hung up on him.  The best.  Uh, we have to take a break, Anthony, but Kylie has something real fast.  Kylie.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Nothing much.  All right, what do you got?  I was curious about the 50-gallon drum challenge.  The 55-gallon drum challenge?  Yeah.  You know what?  Why don't we commit right now?  Let's do it.  Naughty Naughty Contest is going to end in, uh, like, uh, a little over a week, I believe,  okay?  Why don't we, uh, get the 55-gallon drum challenge, uh, happening?  This is a great, great little event that we, uh, pulled off once, and, uh, it went so well. 
[01:10:30]  We get, um, five or six or so 55-gallon drums.  We, uh, put girls in them and seal the top with a little nut and bolt and stuff so they  are not getting out.  There's holes drilled in it so they can breathe.  Yeah, well, you know what, though?  It works because through those holes, especially the ones on top, we pour on top of them just  disgusting things that make them scream and holler.  And if you've ever heard a young girl screaming from inside a 55-gallon drum, if you can't 
[01:11:00]  spank it to that, Norton, uh, you're too well a man.  Because it was just a great, fantastic sound.  Do we have any of the exquisite screaming?  I'm just talking just the screaming.  Yeah, we're looking for that now, and there's also pictures, where could they go to find  these pictures, uh, that's, uh, just go to, uh, Opie and Anthony, go ahead, go ahead.  OpieandAnthony.com, wall of fame, 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:11:30]  And you'll see some of the pictures.  From the last time we did this, but we're taking it to a whole new level this time around.  We put hissing cockroaches in at the end of this contest.  Huge cockroaches.  Did you get Steve with your, you dropped something?  Norton rules.  Huge hissing cockroaches, and, and the girls were screaming like they were eating them  alive.  What a great event.  Thank you, uh, Kylie, for reminding us.  Yeah, Kylie, we're going to do that very soon, all right?  Okay. 
[01:12:00]  You know what we got to do?  We got to do the, uh, the next 55-gallon drum challenge in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Somewhere here in New York, we got to find a club that is willing to have us, and we'll  just have the drums on the stage as we're pouring the stuff in, man.  Look at Bill from Cliffside.  New ingredient to the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Thickly cut ham.  Oh.  Very funny.  All right, Kylie.  All right, thank you.  We'll have details, uh, very, very soon on the 55-gallon drum challenge.  That would be good.  Number two.  There goes Kylie.  Here's a clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge, Ant.  Yeah.  And, uh, and we'll be back, all right? 
[01:12:30]  All right.  Well, maybe one of the other girls would like some.  Yeah.  Tabitha.  No.  Tabitha.  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I hope.  Oh.  We've broken Tabitha, Anthony.  She was so rambunctious.  Compare the audience from the beginning of the show.  We have broken her.  This is so nasty.  She was so rambunctious at the beginning of this. 
[01:13:00]  She was fighting back and everything.  And now she's just sitting there in the fetal position.  There's eyeballs on it.  Yeah.  There's eyeballs on, on, on, uh, Tabitha.  Tabitha's got the fish eyes, yeah.  God damn, it stinks in here, man.  It's really stinking now.  I can only imagine what it smells like in the barrel.  Yeah.  How you doing, Jane?  Jane?  Yeah?  You know what that is?  Um, no.  Let her rip.  Let her rip, man.  With the fish juice and everything.  Yeah, everything.  All right, just dump it.  Dump it.  Dump it.  Right in Jane's pail.  There you go, Jane.  Oh, God. 
[01:13:30]  Oh.  Ow!  Wait a minute.  Oh.  All right, go nuts, guys.  How about that big one?  See that big one?  Oh, my God.  Wendy doesn't like those.  Yeah, Wendy, Wendy is, uh.  Wendy doesn't like the little fish.  Maybe she'll like that big one.  Wendy is having a tough time with the Popeye surprise.  Take the big, that big one.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, get the biggie.  Dump that right in, uh, Wendy's tank.  Come on.  Wendy!  There you go, Wendy. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Yeah, just squeeze it through.  Squish it through.  Squish it through.  Oh, my God.  It's another fish.  That was a whopper.  There is a ton of dead sea life in the barrels now.  How about your surf and turf?  Yeah, why don't you throw that in there?  A little turf for the surf and turf.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, that stinks.  Holy cow, that stinks.  Wow, the clams really smell bad. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God, that stuff is just...  I don't know what that is.  Get it in there quick, though.  Okay.  And don't spill it anywhere.  Dude, that is the worst.  What the hell is it?  Dude, it's some kind of fish chum paste.  Don't put it on her hand too much because she'll fling it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right after today's show, we're heading to New Orleans, broadcast live from Furman Street tomorrow. 
[01:15:00]  The Hummer Girl is going to be there, Anthony.  Yes, Oasis.  Oasis, who gives Hummers to everybody.  She's the one that's down at Mardi Gras all the time.  And you'll see her with the shirt that says Slut on the front and Free BJs on the back.  Right.  And, well, she does service the guys that go down there.  She has a website.  She keeps track of how many Hummers she's given and all this stuff.  And we have linked that website at foundrymusic.com. 
[01:15:30]  Thank God.  Check it out for yourself.  Al called and said he wanted in.  Yeah.  Remember?  Al from New Orleans.  Yep.  And Al is now calling back.  One of the many guys that wants a Hummer from Oasis.  Al, what's up?  Actually, I changed my mind.  She should be something you should do to win something.  Okay?  I mean, come on.  Al, Al, Al.  What's the matter?  Al. 
[01:16:00]  She should be something you should do to win something.  They don't make a condom thick enough for her.  Why would you even wear one, dude?  It's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, Al's out.  He doesn't want in.  It's a little of the hiv.  Three little letters of the alphabet.  Do our boys overseas have condoms on when they're fighting?  No.  Oh, no.  You've got to go right in.  Al has standards, you know?  I'll tell you one thing.  When we're live tomorrow from New Orleans, they will be lined up around the block.  Of course.  For their shot at this.  Of course they will. 
[01:16:30]  There's no doubt about it.  All right.  There's no doubt about it.  All right, Al.  Gentlemen, take care and have a safe flight.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Thank you.  I'll tell you one of these.  Al is either married or has a girlfriend, and he's worried he's going to see his pictures  on the web getting a Hummer on Bourbon Street.  Uh-huh.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Rat, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Rat.  Man, you guys rock.  I just want to let you guys know that.  I love your show.  Oh, hang on.  So what's up, Rat?  Yeah, I wanted to let you guys know how glad I am to see Sacramento representing well  and kind of validating this Naughty Nighty contest you got going. 
[01:17:00]  It's interesting because there's been a preliminary vote going on.  The voting doesn't start until Monday.  No, no.  But a lot of our listeners feel like they need to tell us which girl they really, really love.  Yeah.  By the way, I should say, we read every single piece of email.  It's just really tough to get back to everybody, so don't think it's a waste of time to write  us.  No, we do read it.  We read everything.  Hold on.  We get some good ideas from you, and we appreciate all the stuff you guys say.  But we just can't write everyone back, unfortunately.  But people are writing saying, dude, Bobby's going to win. 
[01:17:30]  Dude, Anna's going to win.  This girl's going to win.  It's going to be interesting when it comes right down to it.  You've got three girls from Sacramento that are smoking.  Oh, yeah.  I'll tell you what.  You guys can keep those effing sloping Yeti heads you got out there.  Sloping Yeti heads.  We'll keep it just the way it is out here.  Sloping Yeti heads.  Oh, yeah.  Is that some local thing?  I don't get that, Rat.  Well, you know, I spend a lot of time in the Marine Corps, been around the world, so we  got terms for everything.  All right.  I'll tell you what. 
[01:18:00]  You guys can keep that stuff out there.  I mean, seriously, though.  Have you seen the latest contestant from Buffalo?  Oh, no.  Maybe I missed that when I got logged on.  Let me tell you.  We're calling her the anal monster.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's what one of her supposedly former boyfriends called her.  An anal monster.  Some of those ones out there, you know, Norton could stand in front of them and play  Shoot the Gap when they smile.  All right, man.  Maybe.  Thank you, Rat.  Hey, but you guys rock.  Seriously. 
[01:18:30]  Seriously.  And it's a breath of fresh air out here in California.  You guys need to get out this way and, you know, get out of that big bullseye.  I mean, Apple you're living in out there.  We're going to New Orleans tomorrow.  Right on.  And hopefully to Cleveland and Buffalo soon and then Sacramento soon enough.  Yeah, yeah.  I tell you what.  We would love to see you guys out here.  Well, spread the word.  All right, Rat.  Yeah, I am.  I am.  And you know what?  I got WOW stickers all over my car and I ain't got nothing yet.  It takes time.  It does take time, especially in the newer cities.  I can put one on the front of the car in case, you know, any of the getting in the back 
[01:19:00]  of the minivan there want to get crazy.  Well, you've got to spell that one backwards.  Hey, Rat, we're not really pushing.  WOW happens every Wednesday.  Basically, if you see WOW on a car or a truck or something, ladies, that means the guy wants  to see your cans, okay?  And it's whip them out whenever.  Yeah, it really is.  We celebrate it on Wednesday.  We celebrate it on Wednesday.  But we're kind of in winter mode here in New York, so we're not pushing it as hard.  But as soon as that first sign of spring here in New York happens, look out.  It'll be back better than ever.  So give it some time, Rat, all right? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're hanging in out here.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, sir.  We're stuck.  Thank you, sir.  There you go.  By the way, Norton United Contest, the qualifying ends tomorrow.  You can either qualify today or tomorrow, and that is it.  We'll be qualifying tomorrow in New Orleans.  Yes.  What are you laughing at?  I was laughing at Eddie.  He says, I'm the Mandingo brother guy.  Was he the one in the picture from the Eddie?  Eddie.  Yo.  Were you in the picture with Oasis?  Yes, I have been on many occasions.  You're the black guy that was really railing it good? 
[01:20:00]  There's two black guys on there.  There's a big one and a little one.  Yeah.  I'm the little short one.  And how many times have you banged this chick?  Dude, it's been at least like twice, three times.  She used to live in D.C.  Yeah.  And she used to throw parties at her house, man.  That's her house in the picture.  So walk us through.  What's the deal with this chick if you see her walking Bourbon Street?  Dude, I'm going to put it this way.  She'll do it.  I don't care what she says about thinking about it. 
[01:20:30]  She'll do it.  She likes the...  If the dude is clean, she'll do it.  She likes the brothers?  Hey, she likes the brothers.  She likes the white guys.  Like the boy you had on the show yesterday.  She likes the beaners.  She likes them all, man.  Anything, huh?  I'll put it like this.  Yeah.  Whoever...  If a contestant comes...  If one of the listeners comes down there, she's going to do it, man.  So you've been to the Super Bowl party?  I was at one of the first Super Bowl slut days.  Super Bowl slut days. 
[01:21:00]  All right, what happened?  What's the call, man?  Dude, we've been there playing squares, man.  How did you get invited?  Yeah, how did you get invited?  How do you win the Hummer?  Hey, man.  Hey, I messed around one day, got one of them spam emails.  Yeah.  And I replied because it was right here in D.C.  Oh, my God.  He answered an email.  He's gone to a B.J. Super Bowl party.  Dude, after that, and I'm talking about...  I don't know how she's doing, man, but I'll put it this way.  All you've got to do is just bring your junk to the party, man.  Get the food.  Everything else is there. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, so the liquor, the food's there.  You just have to supply the junk.  I'm telling you.  So then you'd fill out, like, a box thing, like the pool, like you would at any Super Bowl party?  Like if we were playing square.  Right.  If the score was, like, 14 to 2 and you 4 and 2?  Yeah.  Hey, touchdown, bro.  You the man.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  She'll go right between the uprights.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I'll tell you exactly who I am.  If you look on those pictures, you see the guy taking shots off her chest. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's you.  Yeah, with the black and red shirt.  There you go, bro.  And he's very proud.  That is something.  I swear, ever since I did that, dude, I get paid all the time.  The honeys just don't believe it.  Right.  Right on.  Hey, Eddie.  Yo.  Tell the brothers in Washington, D.C. that O&A are cool, all right?  Yo, I've been trying to do that, but, you know, hey, it's all right.  We've been listening to a whole lot of other stuff.  That's where we, everyone knows that's where all the trends start. 
[01:22:30]  So if we can get the black community, you know, interoping, Anthony, it's going to spread like wildfire down there.  Help us out.  I'll put it to you like this.  If you guys ever make a trip down here to the local station, I'll bring some of my girls up to the station, and you can get wild all you want.  Oh, yeah.  Eddie.  I like that, Eddie.  All right, Eddie.  All right.  All right, man.  I email you my site so you can tell me the girls that you want.  All right, bro.  What are you, a pimp?  Well, aren't we all?  Pimp, hey.  Hey, I'm not as good a pimp as y'all are, but, hey, you know. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, I like this guy, Eddie.  Eddie, you got to call us from time to time.  Dude, just call me.  Hey, whenever y'all want, I'm getting off work, so y'all call me any time.  I'll give you my number.  Eddie, this is the deal.  When you're feeling it, you call the show and you rap with us, all right?  Hey, it's all good, man.  All right, man.  I got a question.  I got to do that because y'all was talking about me on there, so I clown.  That's funny.  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.  That's cool, man.  Did the girl make you wear a bag?  Did she make you wear a bag?  What's that?  Oh, yeah, if you're banging, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, because...  All right, now Norton's not interested.  She do the testing. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, she does?  The only way you're going to...  SATs?  No, right.  Yeah, she's going to test.  But the Hummers are straight.  Oh, yeah.  The Hummers are no coat.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you.  Later, man.  There goes that.  Our new friend in Washington, D.C.  That guy's the real deal, man.  That's something.  That's funny.  What a pisser.  He's the guy from the pictures.  It's so funny, this show, man.  You pop up a website, you start talking about something, and they call in.  That's great.  Our stupid little radio show, we were able to get away with a lot of crap.  We could talk, you know, don't talk dirt about anyone, and now people catch us.  I know, people listen now. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, Robert.  Yo, what's up in 08?  What's up?  How are you, boys?  All right.  We talked about the Homer girl, and she calls out of nowhere.  That's great.  That's how that started.  Go ahead, Robert.  Yeah, you guys want a venue for the public 55-gallon drum barrel?  Yeah, the next 55-gallon drum challenge has got to be in public, man.  I'm telling you.  We haven't done an appearance in New York in a long time.  9-11 kind of screwed us up with that.  Yeah, that's it.  But I think we're going to be coming out.  Hold on.  Let me just finish this crap.  Go ahead.  I think we're going to do the 55-gallon drum challenge somewhere live in New York. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, that'll be great.  What do you got, Robert?  I have the venue for you.  We'll give you the Paradise Club on 33rd Street.  Are you the owner or something, or what?  I'm very friendly with the owner.  I met you guys last Thursday.  I was in with the two girls at the end of the show.  Right.  I've been christened you guys all week.  My neck still hurts.  From the ride through the park with the two of them going at in the back of the car.  Oh, nice, nice.  All right, Robert.  Hey, Norton, remember those two?  I certainly do, sir.  You should have stayed with Piss State.  They couldn't do what they wanted to do there. 
[01:25:00]  All right, Robert.  Robert, we've got to go.  Uh-oh, look at the...  Oh, man, yeah.  But thank you.  All right.  We'll take it under consideration.  Okay, great, guys.  My pleasure.  I heard I called this.  It's a strip joint, though, right?  Yeah.  We need a big life.  Hey, Ant, we found a better clip of the last 55-gallon drum challenge.  Thank God.  This is the one with the hissing cockroaches.  I'm not sure.  Rick's not really sure.  Oh, boy.  We've got to label it where massive screaming.  Oh, boy.  You know?  Oh, boy.  Because there's one clip where they're screaming like they're being hacked apart. 
[01:25:30]  It's great.  Yeah, Norton, right?  This is the deal.  We're going to do the 55-gallon drum challenge right after the Naughty Nighty contest wraps up, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  I'd like to get some girls representing from some of the other cities.  It would be very cool.  You go into this drum.  We seal it up nice.  And then we see how much you can take before you pretty much tell us to get you out of the drum.  Yeah.  And the last girl in the drum will win something really, really cool.  Right.  We'll get on top of that immediately.  There you go. 
[01:26:00]  Immediately.  The last time we did this, we had hissing cockroaches.  Hissing cockroaches.  Hissing cockroaches.  How great is that?  Rick's not really sure if this is the hissing cockroach clip.  I hope it is.  Clip.  Let's take a listen.  But we're going to do this somewhere live in New York.  We'll have details coming soon.  I love hearing it through the mic.  Ow!  Oh, my God.  Wow, that was a big scream.  What was that?  She woke up.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Not that. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Put the top back on.  Oh, my God.  Holy cow.  Sour milk about to go into the bucket.  Dude, that is so foul.  That is so foul.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Everyone's covering their noses in the studio.  That smells so bad.  Sour cream.  Sour cream?  Oh.  I like their little squeal.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Does that stink?  Damn it.  Does that stink? 
[01:27:00]  Damn it.  Oh, you're sure.  Oh, you're sure.  Hey, I didn't think you're supposed to crack them first.  Damn it.  I'm getting pissed now.  I'm going to get sick.  It's fully curdled.  It's fully curdled.  There's enough.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't say that.  This is weird.  Oh, my God.  And I'm getting pissed off.  This is really, really bad.  That is real rank, man.  We bought this cream, like, first thing this morning.  It's been sitting on a radiator for the last ten hours. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's get the mic that's in Christy's barrel.  She's turning to dice.  What is that you're pouring in?  NyQuil.  NyQuil?  NyQuil.  The big green one is Christy.  The big yellow one is son. 
[01:28:00]  The big green one is Christy.  Right.  Very good.  Good obscure reference.  We like that.  Oh, well.  That wasn't it either, Rick.  That's not the hissing cockroaches.  Rick, we need hissing cockroaches.  The hissing cockroaches are so insane.  People will get freaked just in their car.  I think that would be the hissing cockroaches.  Wouldn't that be the last, like, couple of clips?  Because that was kind of the end of the...  All right.  Well, you know, we're going to be talking about the 55-gallon drum challenge as we move on.  All right.  We'll find it.  We'll find the hissing cockroach.  Let's go to the FU line now, Rick. 
[01:28:30]  All right?  Don't forget, we're leaving for New Orleans right after today's show.  Oh, yeah.  Right after the show today.  Let's go to the FU line and see what's happening.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah, this is Dave from Maplewood, New Jersey.  This is a big FU for all you lazy motherfuckers who still have your Christmas lights up.  All right?  It's February.  Remember those old ladies you used to make fun of in your neighborhood who'd leave their lights up all year round?  Yeah, well, you're no better.  You should get off your lazy f***ing football-watching ass and take your damn lights down. 
[01:29:00]  Thank you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Caitlin.  I'd like to leave a big, gigantic f*** you to Jenny in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  You little nasty, stanky bitch.  Thanks a lot for f***ing my boyfriend.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, big FU to my ex-girlfriend for wasting three and a quarter years of my life taking my hooked-up car and my money,  breaking my heart, and then trying to mess up my whole life with that stupid restraining order. 
[01:29:30]  Have a sucky, sucky life, you bitch, de-sucking whore.  Have fun sucking Bill C, you whore.  End of message.  Hey, look who's on the phone with us right now.  Buddy, I'm done.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, well done, you see you.  How's our buddy, buddy?  Hey, usually you pick up the phone and people say to me, what's new?  My songs are new. 
[01:30:00]  I want to talk about my songs.  Oh, yeah, I hear you have a CD out, buddy.  I got a CD.  I hear you have a copy of some of them.  Yes, I was actually listening to the one about the, we're all together on one spaceship, or what's that one called, buddy?  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  And are you singing?  That's better.  Did you sing it?  Yeah, I sing it on the, also, I got a little help from some other people. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  And it's quite an exciting piece.  Have you played it?  We're going to listen to it right now.  I was listening to some in the office.  Why don't I get up here and let the people hear it?  All right, but no, no, no, no.  Well, no, you don't go anywhere, buddy.  Yeah, hold on.  We've got to get just a couple things out of you there, buddy.  Yeah.  It's a new CD out, and you can find it off BuddyEpson.com, right?  Yeah.  All right, don't you go anywhere, though, buddy.  We want to talk to you.  Okay. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Hey, buddy, how old are you now?  How old are you now?  How old am I?  Funny, you should ask.  Ah, ha, ha.  Yeah, but when I'm sitting on the front porch, and a pretty girl walks by.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And my pacemaker starts to open the garage door.  Oh, hey.  Look at that one.  That's an idea of how old I am. 
[01:31:30]  I like that.  But anyway, as long as she keeps up.  Opening the door, that's fine.  That's right.  That's right.  You've still got a lot of spunk there, buddy, don't you?  I'm thinking you're like 95, buddy.  Pardon?  I think you're 95 years old, huh?  How old?  95?  Ah, not 95 yet.  I don't think so.  I don't keep score.  Yeah.  I just, you know, I live by one action.  Use it or lose it.  Use it or lose it.  We got that one. 
[01:32:00]  We got that one.  Of course.  You got that?  I like that.  We like that.  From you.  Buddy, can I ask a favor of you?  Oh, no.  Okay.  I, of course, your beloved character, Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies.  Yeah.  We all remember it.  Lives on in syndication on, where is that being played now?  That Nickelodeon, maybe?  That Nickelodeon.  All of it.  Yeah.  Nickelodeon, yeah.  We love it.  And you did the whale doggy back then. 
[01:32:30]  Can we hear a little Buddy Epson saying whale doggy?  Well, I usually use that for my get offline.  Yeah.  When we're all through talking, I'll give you a, you know, whale doggy.  Well, I just want to hear it all.  One run right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we'll get off another.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Well, doggy.  All right.  Nice.  There it is.  Just like I remember from Buddy Epson.  Very good.  That's not bad at all, Buddy.  Now, Buddy, this CD you got out. 
[01:33:00]  Is this a new CD?  Yeah.  Well, it's on Buddy Epson's originals.  Now, this is a song that you recorded a few years back?  Yes, you recorded it and re-recorded it and smartened it up a little bit so that it sounds better.  Oh, I got you.  Not really.  Available on springboundmusic.com.  Oh, look at you all over the web. 
[01:33:30]  Springbound.com.  On the web.  Or buddyepson.com on the web.  All right.  Or a phone call for 888-280-7715.  All right.  Buddy's doing business.  I like that.  I see on the front page of buddyepson.com we see you in a little Santa hat for Christmas with a saxophone.  With a saxophone?  Very cute picture there, Buddy.  Hey, Buddy, you got a gal in your life?  Yeah.  I played the saxophone since I was in high school. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  And that's where I graduated at Tick Spedicky.  I worked with him for a little while.  Let me read the caption.  Buddy playing a saxophone Christmas 2001.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. Epson, if people order your CD from eatabullet.com, how many songs are on it?  No, that's buddyepson.com.  No, I'm not buddyepson.com.  This is a legend, you idiot.  They're 14 on the CD.  And the favorite turns out to be something I wrote from a two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter. 
[01:34:30]  It's called Angelica.  Did you hear that one?  I didn't hear that one.  We're going to have to give that a listen.  Well, I'll give you the first line.  All right.  Okay.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?  Who?  Angelica.  Who broke a milk bottle out on a drive?  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive? 
[01:35:00]  Who spilled their mommy's Chanel No. 5?  Who?  Angelica.  Very good.  All right, buddy.  Hey, I like that.  Do you have any grandchildren?  No, not yet, buddy.  I'm hoping to have my first grandchild very soon.  We're still working on kids, possibly.  You'll remember that song when you get a grandchild. 
[01:35:30]  I'm going to listen to them.  They have a way of getting into things.  Yeah, I bet they do.  They cause a ruckus around the house, right?  A little bit of a ruckus.  Buddy, you got great-grandkids?  What?  Do you have great-grandkids?  Any great-grandchildren?  Oh, no, no.  Not that I know of.  Oh, hey, back in the day.  They may be keeping something from me, but I don't know of any.  Buddy, can you sing a line from another song on your CD, maybe? 
[01:36:00]  A couple of little verses?  A couple of verses of what?  Any of the other songs that we can find on your CD?  Oh, I got a lot of songs.  You want some character songs like Wild Card or Baby Blues or Snowshoe Thompson.  How about Snowshoe Thompson?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Snowshoe Thompson.  You want to hear a little of that?  Yeah, let's hear a little of that from Buddy.  All right, here we go.  Snowshoe Thompson used to carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hail. 
[01:36:30]  He had no dogs and he had no sled, but one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man, go.  Got to get on through the snow.  Mush, man, mush.  Got to get on through the snush.  Go, man, go.  Means mush and Eskimo.  So go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  Yeah!  And the road's his body.  And the line is down and the bird is walking on the ground.  And the snow is drifted, treetop tall, and nobody getting through at all. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, go, man, go.  It goes on like this.  Oh, yeah.  It goes on like that.  Nice one, Buddy.  Very good, Buddy.  And it's all available on Buddy's CD.  Hey, Buddy, what?  It's got a lift on the last chorus.  Yeah.  So remember now when your days is grim and the drift is tall and your hopes is slim and you  don't see how you're going to get through, old snowshoe made it and so can you.  So go, man, go.  Got to get on through the snow.  There we are.  A little lesson to be learned. 
[01:37:30]  There you go.  A lesson to be learned.  There you go, Buddy.  Don't quit.  It's inspirational.  Hey, Buddy, last time you were on our show, you were singing a dirty version of the Beverly  Hillbillies theme.  A dirty version?  It was kind of a saucy little parody version of that.  The closest thing to a dirty version.  Of course, I sang a song from the hillbillies called,  Well, doggies, well, doggies, well, doggies, well, doggies, yeah, doggies, yeah, doggies, 
[01:38:00]  yeah, doggies, yeah, doggies, oh, doggies, oh, doggies, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  It goes on like that.  It goes on like that, Buddy.  What?  It goes on like that then, huh?  It goes on like that because that's the kind of lyrics they're writing today.  Right, that's what the kids are listening to  Hey, I got an idea  Buddy, can you do that again?  I want to help you along with that song 
[01:38:30]  You want to help you along with it?  Yeah, hold on  I got parts of it  I'll tell you when  Hold on, hold on  I like that, what was that?  The Well Doggy song?  Yeah  A Well Doggy song?  Yeah, give us a little more of that  A little more Well Doggy?  Yeah, Well Doggy  I haven't written a song about Well Doggy  Well, do it again  But what I'll do, you'll hear it on springboundmusic.com  Page out of the old plug book  Yeah  But I got a variation on Well Doggy's 
[01:39:00]  Oh, you do?  Not Well Doggy's, but another song that I wrote  All right  And, oh, wait a minute  Did you get the phone number in case you can't get the book?  Oh, yeah, we got the phone number  You want to give it out again, buddy?  888-280-7715  There you go  Hey  And here is the middle part of the song 
[01:39:30]  Okay, let's hear  The postman came the first of May  The mailman came the very next day  Nine months later, there was hell to pay  Who fired the first shot?  The blue and the gray  Well, babies  Well, babies  Oh, I get you  That's a little racy there, buddy  Huh?  Is that what you wanted?  Civil War humor  Yes, for some racy  First hand  That's as racy as I get  That's as racy as you get?  Yeah  Buddy, weren't you writing a parody version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme song? 
[01:40:00]  A parody version?  Well, I wrote another version of it  It's not a parody  Oh, okay  It's inspired by the ballad of Jed Clampon  See, that's what I think he was trying to do last time  You'll get it when they send you their full CD  Oh, can we hear a little bit of it from you live, maybe?  Well, I don't know  It's so unique  Yeah  I don't care  There's lyrics around in my life 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah  We saw that  We saw that last year  Okay, well  All right  I got other lyrics  But they're songs that are talking songs  Like they used to do on the radio  Like smoke, smoke, smoke  You know, that kind of thing  Right, right  All right there, buddy  Hey, buddy, we love you, man  Well, thank you very much  We're going to promote your CD  It's, I don't know what the name of the CD is  The CD is Buddy's Originals

[01:49:00]  And EW. Hey, Christy. Yeah. How you doing? I'm good. Christy, why are you calling the show  today? My boyfriend has wanted me the 6 o'clock queen forever. Oh, the 6 o'clock queen. But  it's 6.15. That's okay. I've been on the whole show. It's not a burp. It's not a fart. It's  not too sweet. It's not too tart. It's 6 o'clock. It's time for a queen. Blow out the candles.  Make a wish. It's like a heart but smells like fish. It's 6 o'clock. It's time for a queen. 
[01:49:30]  Undo your pants. Let them drop to the floor. Clampes up and let yourself roar.  Queen.  All right, Christy. Are you ready? I'm ready. All right. Let's hear it. Okay.  Hear it? Yeah.

It's 6 o'clock. 
[01:50:00]  It's time for a queen. Undo your pants. Let them drop to the floor.  Clampes up and let yourself roar. Queen.  All right. Very good. That feature back in the cell. That was good.  That was a good one. I can't wait until we just do a whole montage one day of all the  queefs we've heard. That's a great idea. Just string them together. Then we could maybe  put them in a sampler and make jingle bells out of it on Christmas like they do with the  dogs. That's a great idea. Or you could just make a soundboard. Yeah. And then you can 
[01:50:30]  make your own tunes. Queef tunes. There are so many. Don't play with Daddy. Go throw it  to Daddy. Oh, yeah, baby. What? You say it. I'll give it to you hard. What? What'd you  just say? Christina? Oh, I'm sorry. You're talking to your kid? Yeah. Oh, damn. I thought  she was being all hot. Oh, no, sorry. Yeah. You tell it to Daddy. Throwing her little bouncy  ball at me. Oh. You guys, listen. I got a comment. Yeah. The one who called the dude  queef? Yeah. It felt like she was just blown in on the phone instead of... No. No, hers 
[01:51:00]  was good. No, mine was good. I called in last week. No. I was from Philly. Remember you  guys said you were going to be in Philly? I'll tell you, man. This syndication has brought  out the competitive spirit in everybody. Yeah. My queef was better than hers. No, I'm  not a good person. All right. Why don't we go with this? Christina, why was your queef  better than today? All right. All right. What's that? Why was your queef better? Because  her sound like she just put the phone to her mouth and blew in the phone. And what did  yours sound like? I don't... I don't... Well, I'm not going to do it right now. I can't 
[01:51:30]  because my daughter's in the room. Did it sound like this? Now she's got morals. No. Yeah,  that's good. That's a nice queef. No. That's nice. Mine sound like a little rumble. I've  never rated queefs before in my life, ever. I think one's as good as the next. You know  what I mean? We might have to sit around and rate queefs one day. Yeah. Exactly. Do  a contest. Who does the best queef? You might be on to something there, Christina. All  right. Why don't you go take care of your kid? What's that? Why don't you go take care  of your kid? Yeah. Hold on. My husband's home with me. All right. Hold on. Then Tom wants 
[01:52:00]  to say hi to you. I was doing it in a polite way. Uh, Tom? Yeah, what's up? Hey. Listen,  hey, hooker, why don't you go take care of that kid of yours and stop acting like a disgusting  swat? Excuse me? You're a pig. You're a pig. You're a pig. Go throw the ball back to your  kid and then go throw yourself out a window, you pig. Excuse me, where are you calling  from? You're a swat, struck dead, whore. Frenchy. Is it Frenchy? This is my gig. What are you  doing? Yeah, it's almost swat and whore. Okay. Whatever. Hey, Christina, I didn't say 
[01:52:30]  that. No, where was he calling from? Uh, probably New York.  That sounds like a New York guy. Okay. I'm a swat, my hooker. I'm sure the same thing  would come out of someone from Cleveland today. Yeah. Are you going to drive down and beat  him up? No, I'm a full-time mom and I work full-time. You're a full-time whore, you bitch  rag. Why don't you shut up? Go play with your kid, you hooker. Christina? Yeah? Do you hear  him? Oh, yeah. It doesn't bother me. I'm not going to get all upset because I know it's not 
[01:53:00]  true, so, oh well. Hey, you know it's not true, you whore. Go ahead. Go throw the ball  to your kid after you go diddle yourself. Getting all the diddle stuff on you. Why don't you  come over and lick me? Whoa. Nice language. Nice language, you hooker. That's right, I'm a  hooker. That's right, I'm a hooker. Dude, calm down, man. Philadelphia, that's right, and I  stick my d*** in me. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to  apologize for that caller. Christina, how could you say that type of stuff in front of your 
[01:53:30]  kid? We're dumping out like crazy. No, no, no, I'm in another room. Oh, it sounds like  it. I want to apologize for that last caller, Christina, that's awful. Eh, whatever. People  like that are a bunch of lowlife. They have to call in and call a female hooker. Shut up,  slut. Why don't you suck it? Is that what you call your mom? Suck it. Is that your mom?  Is that what you call your mom? A hooker and a slut? Yes. Yeah, as a matter of fact.  Yeah. When she calls up and argues over the authenticity of a queef, then yeah, I tend  to think that from time to time. She's like, that girl's a loser. Listen to you. That 
[01:54:00]  queen sucked. I mean, this hasn't been a classless conversation since the word go here.  Mine had a rumble. You whore. Isn't it true that your kid just threw a rope ladder down  and climbed out? Oh, yes, it is. So worn and weathered? That's awful.  Repelled down like a soldier? Anthony, don't you think that's awful? That's terrible,  man. Why don't you hang up, you idiot? Yeah, Christina, I'm sorry, Christina. No,  that's cool. I understand. Doesn't bother me one bit. Where are you calling from, Christina? 
[01:54:30]  From Philly. Yeah, we see, we need all the listeners we can get from Philly, and this  idiot has really pissed me off. Yeah, Christina's from Philly, and she can fillies herself up  with as much C as she can. All right, all right, all right. Listen, listen, stop. Did  Philly get the idea for cream cheese by you pulling down your panties?  I got the Amanda cheese from Down Under. Do you want to come and sniff it? You disgusting  mess. All right, hold on. Anthony, that guy, we've got to hang up. Hey, knock it off.  That's awful. Jackass. Oh, my God, it's the Amanda cheese from Down Under. Does he want to come 
[01:55:00]  and sniff it? Yeah, what's your answer to that, smartass? Yeah, he doesn't have one. Now he's  all scared. Oh, no, I put him on hold. Oh, did you? Yeah, yeah, here he is. Dude, what do you  have to say about that? I'd rather be a smartass than have stink-ass like Christina, you slut.  Oh, that's a tough one. Oh, you over a cleef. Oh, my God, I'm going to go cry to my mom. I'm a slut.  Yeah, go cry, you bitch. Uh, wait a second, hold up. You slut? No, no, no, no. This ain't 
[01:55:30]  another caller calling in. My husband just said it's Anthony messing with me. What? I  am not, I am not taking, uh, that. My husband just walked in the kitchen and said, hold up,  that's Anthony trying to mess with you. You know, Christina, we're, uh, you're, you're too  quick for us, I got to tell you. It's not Anthony, I swear to you, you bitch. Oh, now the,  the girl that is, the other girl's pissed off. Oh, there we go. Christy, today's queefer  is calling up, Christina. What's that? Christy. Yeah. Hey. Hi. 
[01:56:00]  Wait, well, all right, hold on. There's a Christy and a Christina. So, Christina, I was  talking to Christy, so shut your mouth, okay? Whatever. When I say Christina, that's when  you say hi. Wait. We're talking to Christy now. Hi, Christy. Hi. Dude, she's talking  about my, um, queef wasn't up to par with hers. Yeah. What, because mine doesn't rumble  because I'm loose? What the hell? Wow. You know? You pop another kid out, why don't you?  I sure will. God. God. Christy, do you have any children?  Huh? Do you have any children, Christy? Yes, I have one. What? That doesn't make 
[01:56:30]  one. Wow. One's okay. One when I was 17. I'm 23 now. All right. 17, you little slut.  Hey, Christy and Christina. Yeah. Why don't we, um, why don't we have a queef-off?

Find a room. We've got to have a queef-off. We've got to have a queef-off. I don't want to be  scared of you. Come on. Honey, because you're like dangling. All right. And how would you 
[01:57:00]  know? Are you here looking at me? All right, listen. You're the one talking about  on the air. Find a room that doesn't have a kid in it. You're a gangster. Yeah, I'm  a gangster. Okay. She's like the typical housewife. I'm a gangster. Housewife. All  right, Christina, get in another room. I'm a hooker who had my child at 17. I ain't  a hooker, honey. I'm a nerfing sitter from CSU. Thank you. Goodbye. No, no, no. Don't  hang up. Christy? Oh, I'm not hanging up. Uh-uh. Queef-off. Queef-off. Queef-off. Christina? Yeah, 
[01:57:30]  I'm here. Are you ready for the queef-off? I sure am. She can go first. This is better  than the pree. You think she's all big and shot? Yeah. Hold on. Wait a minute. I think  the, um, me, you know, like little queen of queefs to go first to tell me what I'm up  against. This is worse than my pre-five press conferences with you people. Get ready and  get the kids out of the room there, Christina. No, we're going to know where I'm going to  have a queef-off. Why don't we even try to show our intelligence on this show when it's  that easy, man? Christina? Yeah. All right, you ready for this? Sure. All right, you sound 
[01:58:00]  very pissed off. Yeah, I guess. All right, hold on. Is your husband then blowing air  up there? Getting ready. No, my husband doesn't blow up there. My c***. No, no, no. My husband's  the real guy. All right, let's, uh, let's all stop with the, uh, explaining. Yeah, everyone  knows the deal. Everyone knows. Can I just tell you real quick? What? You guys rock. All right,  Christina. Seriously. No, I had to tell you that. I didn't like you guys in the beginning,  but now I love you guys. No one does. Well, we love you. Thanks. Hey, uh, Christy. Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  All right, you ready, Tim? I'm ready. Can we get the kid out of the scene? All right. People  want to hear the queef-off. Well, she can stay in the room. It's okay. It's all like she's  never seen me before. Oh, God. Oh, my goodness. Okay. All right. All right, who wants to,  uh, should we flip a coin for the... No, I'll go because I'm not the sissy who calls and complains.  Oh. All right, who was that, Christina? Yes. You were the one that complained. Thank you.  Well, because you were... No, I wasn't the sissy. Well, you know, look, we don't have  time. I want to hear a queef with a baby background. All right, listen, Christina, you were the 
[01:59:00]  one that said... It's a special circle. You were bragging about your queef from last week  and you said that Christy sucked today. I did. All right, so why don't you let her, let  it go. All right, let's... What's the shit? Everyone's got to be quiet. All right, you ready?  Ready. Be quiet. Hold on one second. Here it goes.  Awful. Wow. All right. Yeah, that's going to be a tough one to beat. That's Christina.  Uh, Christy. Yeah. You think you can beat that? I don't think it's going to be that lengthy, 
[01:59:30]  but it'll be a lot louder. Oh, all right. That's good. Here it goes. You have to put  your arm under your pit. Okay, ready? Here it goes. Christy. Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.  Oh, please. Come on. That was with your boyfriend blowing in on the phone again. No, it wasn't.  Whatever. Okay. Whatever. All right, Christina, why don't you try to match that? All right,  who was that? That was not me. Wait, who was that? That was me, Christy. That was Christy? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah. Who was that? No, that was me doing that on the phone. That was just her blowing in the  phone. No, it doesn't. No, Christy's kicking your ass. We can tell the difference between blowing  the phone and the real deal. Uh, no. All right, Christy. You're not a woman. You don't  know what it really sounds like. Oh, you're right, honey. I'm not. That's why I'm getting  f***ed. At least I'm not a skank. And you know, and how do you know my l*** moose? Are  you in between? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, ladies. Hold 
[02:00:30]  on. They're yelling and screaming. We dumped out about five times there. Girls take pride.  I'm from Cleveland. I'm from gangsta. What are you going around? Showing your  cleavage, you skank? Oh, yeah. I'm a skank. That's why I'm at home waiting on my, like,  five days. Are you married? Huh? Are you married? Do you know what it's like to live? No, you  probably don't. So what? Because you're trying to mommy death to kiss your ass. Whatever.  Oh. Hold on. Oh, hey. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Well, I'm out of dump here. Hold on. We're out of dump,  ladies. Hold on. Hold on. They're screaming. I think we should get some chloroform for these 
[02:01:00]  two. Chloroform. Yes. All right. We had to pot them down because we ran out of delay. Let me see if these  girls are still yelling at each other. Kristi and Kristina. Yes. All right. All right, listen.  Girl, you can't curse, man. I can't wait to hear this back when Rick gets a hold of it and takes  out all the stuff. Well, who's the winner? Well, why don't we try one last time? We've only got  like two minutes left in the show, Kristi. Now, you know what? What? I'm going to pass on it because  I better save things to do with my life. I'm like the skank on the other line. That's why you called. 
[02:01:30]  Now she's on the line. You're on 15 minutes doing this, honey. All of a sudden, now you  got somewhere to go. Come on. That's why she called in the first place. Did the crack dealer  show up? What happened? She called in the first place. Don't back out, Kristi. Give  one more, man. One last shot as we end the show. All right. You want one more, you'll get  one more. One more. Here we go. It makes you happy. Make a sissy wine happy, okay? You'll get  one more. All right. Here goes Kristi. Listen. Wow. I do this all day. I do it a lot. All  right. Hold on. Give Kristi a chance. She does it all day, but she can do it one more time 
[02:02:00]  for us. Right. Now, Kristi, go ahead. Here we go. Yeah, because she's crying. She wants  to do it again. Oh, my God. Because she's having her boyfriend put the phone up and blown  in the phone. No, she's not. Oh, my God, Kristi. What are you such an authority on it for? How  do you know? Hey, we all have our passions. I'm voting for Kristi as far as the creep off 
[02:02:30]  goes. Yeah, I got to go with Kristi. Kristi, Mike, get a call. Yeah, I'm going for you. Oh,  you guys are sweet. Oh, sore loser, whatever. I'm the loser? Okay. That's what I want.  Yeah. Like I care? Okay, well, then hang up. Why should I? Christina, I liked yours. It  had the quality of letting the air out of a truck tire through a London broil. But Kristi's,  I like the tone of Kristi's. Okay, I'm going to go in the corner and cry now because I lost. 
[02:03:00]  All right. Well, all right, great. No sore losers. Well done. No sore losers.  Everyone's really all. Everyone's a winner here. No, I was going to say a loser. Well,  yeah. All right. But, uh, no one. It's the queef off. It was fun. All right,  Kristi and Kristi, thank you. There they go. The queef off. They're getting pissed off at  each other.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance. Oh, I feel like being an idiot. Anthony. I'm a retard. 
[02:03:30]  I'm a retard. The opium's Anthony's show. That thing's hilarious.  And he's a little.  Katie.  Yes.  Hi, Katie. How are you?  Have you been listening to us on hold?  I sure have.  Are you scared?  Um, not at all.  Oh, good. Good.  You're from a magazine I don't read.  Um, Jane Maggi.  Which one? Jane.  I've read a little bit out of Jane when I've seen something, uh, on the cover.  I bet you have.  It's hard to compete with a pair of double T boobs, but I'll do my best. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah. Now, she's got an interesting story, though. This, um, this girl applied to be an intern  for former President Bill Clinton. Katie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You, Katie?  I sure did.  Yes.  So you got big boobs.  I'm a healthy girl.  I've read the story. She's a healthy girl. And we'll explain. I thought you were like,  uh, I don't know, the, the, someone that worked for the magazine.  You know, you could probably tell the story better than I, because it was you. 
[02:04:30]  And I, I found this very funny. So just let the people know, uh, what you did and, uh,  what happened.  Okay. Well, we, we heard that the former President Clinton's office was looking for interns.  So a bunch of us didn't, resumes, and nobody heard anything back. And then we dropped off,  um, my resume again with a Polaroid of me in a red dress. And three, three hours later,  they called me in for an interview.  Isn't that classic? 
[02:05:00]  Like, all the qualifications that are on, uh, all these different resumes, they didn't  pay any attention to, they didn't, uh, call anyone back. But the second you sent in a  picture in a red dress showing that you're a healthy girl, can I, can I help this story  a little, uh, a little bit, Anthony? Because they have a whole list of the, the wannabe  interns. So there was intern wannabe number one. She attended SUNY Stony Brook. Uh, the response,  nothing. Okay. Intern wannabe number two, an NYU student, zilch. Uh, pushy follow-up calls 
[02:05:30]  resulted in a Clinton staffer saying that all positions were filled. Even doggy style. Intern  wannabe number three, which was Katie. Yeah. Uh, the response, not a word. Yeah. Intern wannabe  number four, Katie again. Same exact resume. Same exact resume with a photo of herself looking  pretty hot. Right, Katie? Right. Cleavage and everything? That's not good that far. Well,  just showing that she's a healthy girl. Just showing. Healthy girl. Just showing the assets.  The response, three hours later, Clinton's office called her for an interview. How soon 
[02:06:00]  can you come in? They asked. The guy who interviewed her the next day said her cover letter really  stood out and chuckled. Are you going to take the gig? I would have. You really would have?  Absolutely. Absolutely. I, I, I think that, uh, Bill Clinton, we love him. He's a solid  guy. We, we, this is, we just had some fun with us. And he had brilliant foreign policy.  Um, but would you have, what would you have done if he had, like, hit on you? Oh, I couldn't 
[02:06:30]  say. I'm, I'm actually more of an Al Gore fan myself. Al Gore. Al Gore. He's not a tough  on crime guy, but no, what would you have done if Clinton had hit on you? Al Gore. Would  you have, you know, he's a good looking guy. I mean, he's not just the president, he's  very handsome. Oh, you find him handsome there, uh? Yeah. Do you? No, I'm just saying, would  you have gone with it if he had, you know? Asked to see the goat? Yeah. I beg your pardon.  If he had hit on you, would you have went with it? Or would you have said no thank you? Yeah.  Like, even before any of this happened? I think, I think I would have politely demurred. Yeah? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah. Hey, do we even know why you, uh, are not an intern? Um, it's a great question. I, I, I wish I'd gotten  the job. You really do. It looked like they wanted you, right? So, what happened? I don't  know. I, I, I don't know what happened. Hmm. I've hit a great can of it, so, couldn't say.  Even with what happened, you would have been an intern. You do know that eventually you  probably would have gotten hit on. Oh, if only. You probably would have. He doesn't hang 
[02:07:30]  out with his wife anymore. That whole thing, uh, have you been keeping tabs on what, uh, Bill's  been up to? Um, no, not exactly. The guy, first of all, you never, ever, ever, ever see  him and Hillary together anymore. There's no reason for it. She got elected. He's not  president anymore. They don't have to carry on that charade for another day. So, uh, he's  out. Now, the last picture we have seen of, uh, Bill Clinton is in, um, Israel. He was 
[02:08:00]  in Jerusalem, and he's got his arm around this blonde. Well, and the other arms around  it, at least two out of these three girls over here. Yeah. They're taking a picture,  but the blonde is very busty. Very healthy girl, as you put it. Put it. And this is what  he does now. He travels the globe looking for new quim. It's, and. Nice work if you can get  it. Well, yeah. But, um, I don't know. He's kind of, he's kind of showing his true colors  here, like anyone didn't know what they were, but perhaps the guy should have paid a little 
[02:08:30]  more attention on foreign policy and what the hell was going on in the world than trying  to get laid. You know what I mean? Hey, Toots, are you going to apply for, uh, the Bush White  House at all? Sorry, am I Toots? Yeah, are you going to apply for the Bush White House? Um, I don't  do Republicans. Why not? No? What do you think of George W? Yeah, I, I don't.  Are you, are you going to, are you going to protest for the World Economic Summit? Only  in fur. You don't like fur, do you? I think she says she's going to wear fur. Oh, okay. 
[02:09:00]  Uh, I just see her as one of those, um, liberal women. Yeah, but she's young. What are you, 22,  23? What are you going to do? I'm 25. Yeah, all right. That's, you know, still relatively  young. I mean. Hey, who turned off the power? Would you, like, if you had, say you'd become  an intern for Clinton? Now, I'm asking this in all seriousness. Would you have been angry  if he arced seeds on you? I beg your pardon? Would I have been angry if he what? Arced  seeds on you. Like he did with, uh, what's her name? Monica, he arced some seeds on your 
[02:09:30]  dress. Arced seed. You got it? Arced seed? You don't get out much, do you? No. Katie,  what do you do for fun? Wow. What are you talking about? Well, that's what we've been  asking. No, we're saying hobbies. Yeah, like, what do you do for fun? Um, I'm, I'm, I'm a  good girl. Uh-huh. All right. No, I, I'm, I'm. Is that, is that you banging your head 
[02:10:00]  against a wall? Ah, yeah. All right. Um, all right. She can't, she can't hear us. What  do you want? So, why don't we do a little, uh, silencing. All right. What's that, uh,  Katie? Katie? Yes? You're a reporter for who? I'm a reporter for Jane Magazine. And, uh,  what kind of stories do you do for Jane Magazine? I do, I do undercover work. What do you mean  by that? Um, I go to sex addicts conferences. I, I hang out with polygamists. I, I, I hang out 
[02:10:30]  with polygamists. I, I apply for internships at the former President Clinton's office.  You name it. Anything, anything you want to see is in, is in the April issue of Jane.  It's on the newsstand, February 11th.  Hello?  One more. One more hello. Come on. One more hello. Hello? Come on. Where'd she go? 
[02:11:00]  Oh. You're breathing. She's holding in. She's holding on a little. She's hanging in there.  I'm getting in. Getting a little frustrated. A little sigh. A little sigh. Mm-hmm.  One more hello. Hello? Say hello if you're a ho-bag. Hello? 
[02:11:30]  One more hello. Ooh, getting a little. If you're a ho-bag.  She's getting mad. You can tell. Fat, heaving body.  One more hello if you're a twat.  Mm-hmm. Does she know this show? This is the, the best defense for the silent game. The reverse  silent game.  Hi, Dan.  Wait, oh, what is someone talking to her? Hello? Hello? What's she doing? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, she's calling back. She's calling back. But see, it's busy because she's still on. She's still on the other line.  Hello? Hello? Hold back. Hold back. 
[02:12:30]  Hold back. She's calling. She's calling the line we gave her, but she's still on. And she doesn't know.  Yeah, she goes. Listen. Oh, it's still busy. She's calling herself. What are those people doing? Why is it still busy? I'll try again.  I bet it's busy. Oh, one more time. Come on. Try again.  Oh, yeah. I bet you ten bucks is busy.  Ah-ha. Pay me.  Ooh. Ooh.  Getting a little piss.  Hello? 
[02:13:00]  Andrea?  Hello?  Andrea, am I done? Am I done? It sort of cut off, and then...  More than you know.  I'm asking if I'm done, because it cut off, and...  Can I hang up the phone now?  Well, they said, what do you do?  And I told them, and then there was silence, and it looks like the line's still engaged, but...  Call back again. 
[02:13:30]  Call again.  Come on, you dope.  Come on.  Come on.  It's just called back.  Listen, I bet it's busy, Opie.  It's busy, because she's calling the number that we have her on.  One more time.  You freaking idiot. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah?  I'm...  That's not me.  Persistent cow.  This is great.  Yeah?  What line? 
[02:14:30]  They're telling her.  Hello?  And then she goes...  Someone told her, you're on the end.  She goes, what line?  People understand, right?  We gave her a number to call.  Yeah.  She was still on that number, and assuming that we hung up, so she kept calling the number  we gave her to get back on the show, but it's busy because she's still on the line.  God damn, that is so much fun.  I thought that was going to be a really bad version of the silent game, but that turned 
[02:15:00]  out to be a classic.  The silent game takes a weird little turn there, didn't it?  Who saw that coming?  The silent game ever, Ernie up from Jersey.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Acting hilarious.  We're back with the O and Anthony show. 
[02:15:30]  Carlos Mencia in the studio.  Before we get to Carlos and find out what he's up to, got a great instant feedback here.  And Carlos, you know.  I'm here, bro.  Okay, good.  Joe from the City writes, you guys just played the FU line, and there was a 56-year-old pregnant  mom.  F'd up funny, man.  Did you notice when we played the FU line?  No.  Rick got it for us.  A 56-year-old pregnant mom?  And I guess this is Big Mike, who's the regular on the show. 
[02:16:00]  Okay.  So if there's a story to be told here, Big Mike, you gotta give us a call.  But this is the FU he left on the FU line.  All right.  I want to say FU to my stepfather for getting my mother pregnant at the age of 56, man.  What the f*** y'all thinking about, man?  Huh?  FU.  Pop, I don't care how many years you took care of me.  I'm too old to have a little brother or sister, and you're too old to be having a baby.  That was his FU.  It went right by our heads today. 
[02:16:30]  I'm too old to have your little brother.  But see, he's looking to the future.  He knows mom's, what, 56.  Right.  She's probably dying, what?  Right.  And he figured, man, I'm going to take care of this baby from nine all the way to eight.  Oh, that's a bull.  He's going to be a dad.  Yeah, exactly, man.  Have to deal with a little kid.  He doesn't care about the brother.  You know he doesn't care about being a brother.  It's the fact that he knows he's going to be a dad, the parents are going to croak, and he's going to be stuck.  There's a story that he needs to tell.  He'll call the show.  He listens every day.  Very fertile.  Almost as good as the story we heard yesterday. 
[02:17:00]  What was the good story yesterday?  This is the sickest friggin' thing.  Here's briefly, as brief as I can be, what Laura Korn told us that happened.  And who is Laura Korn?  She's a sexpert who writes books on how couples can have better sex together.  Oh, she's one of those.  Isn't there like a D'Angelo or something?  Angelo, Chase, something like that?  There's a lot of them.  There's a lot of them.  She's pretty cool, though.  You know what it is?  Hold on.  Big Mike's checking out.  Ah, damn it.  And then we'll get to Laura Korn's story.  One story at a time, because it's only one thought per break. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, right.  A lot of our listeners get confused, man.  Learned that in radio school.  Yo, man.  Big Mike.  What's up?  What up?  Nothing, man.  I feel bad, man.  Is that a fake story or a real story?  No, it's real, man.  Because we don't do fake radio here.  It's the real deal, man.  Your pops knocked up...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, it's your stepdad?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're going to be a father?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not good, though, man, but I'm upset, man. 
[02:18:00]  Wait, Big Mike, how old are you?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Anonymous, man.  I'm going to leave it alone.  I'm not even going to say it.  I'm just wondering what the age difference will be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's you and your half-brother or whatever, half-sister, whatever it turns out to be.  Yeah, I'm going to have to take care of the child, man.  There's no way your mom's pregnant at 56 years old.  Man.  How much you want to make a bad man?  Oh, you know, as life expectancy gets longer, the time that a woman can produce gets a little  longer.  Exactly.  Although you don't want to...  Maybe the poor little kid being in a uterus that's like a walnut shell. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  They might have dried up.  Maybe she's just getting fat and she doesn't want to tell her husband.  No, my mom, yo, as a matter of fact, my mom and my pops are in real good shape, man.  Yeah, your mom must be in real good shape.  I love her there.  They took care of themselves, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would there be any reason, though, she would lie, you know what I'm saying?  Nah, nah, nah, man.  My mom's don't lie like that, man.  So when is this kid dropping, bro?  What happened?  When's the kid dropping?  Probably another seven months, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jeez, man. 
[02:19:00]  How did your mom tell you?  She just came out and told me.  You know, me and my moms, we keep in real with each other, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Not as real as your stepdad's keeping in real, don't you?  That's keeping in real, my friend.  You all live in the same house?  Nah, I don't know, man.  I got my own house, man.  I'm just wondering if you're hearing what's going on.  Nah, nah, I'm a grown man.  I hold my own, you know?  Basically, you're going to be about 50 when this kid turns 18, right?  Am I about right?  Basically, yeah.  He's going to have to take you to the father-son stuff at school. 
[02:19:30]  Exactly.  So it doesn't look ridiculous when an 80-year-old man is his father.  But it's all good, though, man.  That was always bad when I went to school.  You know, all I'm just saying, they're too old to be having babies, man.  Of course they are.  56.  Yeah.  How many kids did your mom, you know, pop out?  Oh, I'm the only child, man.  Only child.  Oh, that's got something to do with it, too.  Come on, now.  It's a little jealousy.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I'm not the little boy anymore.  Good boy, Mom. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, you're in competition.  It's over.  I'm still the baby, Mother Effa.  Yeah, exactly.  I got a really stupid question.  Oh, he gets to go to the baby gap.  Oh, he gets to go to the baby gap.  Yeah, don't kill me, man.  Don't kill me.  I'm upset anyway, man.  And, you know, I got to go out working, man.  Hold on.  It's a stupid question, but was this a mistake or was this planned?  Yo, I don't know.  I'm not in the bedroom with them.  Can I call your mom, Big Mike?  No, hell no.  Oops. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, Big Mike, did you snap at your mom like you snapped on the F.U. line?  No, I just said a few words, you know.  Yeah.  But, you know, my mom's is my mom's, man.  My mom's raised me.  I think she'll do good, but, you know, she's old, man.  Change your diapers at 56.  She's going to change hers.  They're going to Florida somewhere.  Ah, changing each other.  Yeah, exactly.  She's going to change her to pens and his pampers.  Come on, man.  Hey, yo, y'all take it easy, man.  I'll call it to all, man.  See how y'all doing, all right?  Big Mike, you got to tell your mom to give up the Hummer, man. 
[02:21:00]  Nah.  Yo, man, I got to go, man.  All right, there he goes.  All right, peace.  It's just a nasty thing because, you know, you get parents that are in their 60s or even pushing 70 when the kid is in his late teens.  Right.  Stuff like that.  Whew.  How, what, you're not relating to the kid.  You can't throw the ball around with him.  Right.  Something like that.  So, I think it's kind of selfish, you know what I mean?  But it might just be a mistake.  Remember going to school, though?  I was going to mention this.  We used to have the father-son things or, you know, the parent-teacher conferences. 
[02:21:30]  Right.  We'd go to school and there was always that kid that was the late-in-life child.  Right.  It's like, oh, my God, here comes this old fossil couple.  It's like, oh, is that your grandma?  And they're like, nah.  Was that your trouble?  No, my mother was like, forget about it.  She was 22, I think, when I was going to school.  I think in high school she was 22.  But there's the opposite, bro.  You know, there's the way us pigs do it where we're 14 and our kid's 8, you know what I mean?  And we're going to high school, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:22:00]  And we're in detention and our kid walks by the hall room.  What are you doing here, Dad?  Shut up.  Keep walking.  You know what I'm saying?  How old was your parents when they had their last kid?  Because you have, like, what, 17 brothers and sisters?  Yeah, it's 18 of us.  I think she was 42, the last one.  All those kids.  She started at 15, bro.  And still younger than, right.  Right.  Started at 15.  Yeah.  But it sucks for my sister because, you know, she has aunts that are three.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, it's like this whole weird, you know. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, it screws up the family tree.  Yeah, exactly.  When you got the three-year-old aunts and uncles.  Exactly, man.  That's odd.  Tell Carlos the other story.  Oh, yeah, the story from yesterday.  Yeah, so Laura Cohen was in here.  This is one of the sickest stories you'll ever hear, my friend.  She's one of those women, she sells books about sex to the married couples that just  it ain't happening for them anymore, you know.  It's like all of a sudden you're not getting any and she's got these books and little things.  All right, tear out one page, read it to your mate and, you know, just hop on the bed,  give her a slam. 
[02:23:00]  So she had this assistant.  Her name was Meg.  She was a raging alcoholic, drunk all the time.  When Laura was away one day, Meg used Laura's apartment to have sex with a guy.  The guy does it in the back door, balloon knot.  In the leather Cheerio.  Right.  That's right.  He lets go there.  Right.  She gets up, goes to the fertility clinic across town, has it removed from there and put in 
[02:23:30]  the baby-making place.  Has a baby.  Now, this guy didn't know, you know, he was just unleashing.  He's trying to have some fun.  Yeah, right.  Right.  Being safe as far as pregnancy goes.  Purposely did the blue knot, so.  Yeah, you know, she's not going to get pregnant there.  Yeah.  Then the woman has the baby.  A couple of years later dies of alcoholism.  And the baby's put up for adoption.  But now the guy is suing Laura Korn for theft of seed because it was in her apartment. 
[02:24:00]  Thieving the.  Saying she was in on this whole thing.  That she was in on it.  Like it was a conspiracy that she planned with this woman to.  I'm just.  And then the other questions that came up were, what kind of ethics did a doctor have  to take a turkey baste to her back door like that, extract it, and then put it in so she  could have a kid?  Did she do it at a.  Did a legitimate doctor do it?  That's what I hear.  And that's what she said.  It seems like anyone could do it, but it doesn't seem very sanitary. 
[02:24:30]  You know, and then what kind of issues is that kid going to have when he grows up?  He's going to be.  He's going to have a crappy attitude.  He's alive.  You've got some funky tastings, Mark.  Oh.  It just sounds.  It was one of those stories that like.  I could just picture, you know, cheeks all clenched up walking through the front door  trying to save every drop.  Unless she did something in her apartment before you went to the fertility clinic.  Did she put it in a little baggie or something? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, let it go in there.  Maybe it was already in a little baggie, if you know what I mean.  I don't know.  Unfortunately, we won't get to the bottom of it.  No.  The bottom of it.  That's funny, Opie.  Get to the bottom of it.  Get to the bottom of it.  Bet the kid had brown eyes.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I have the same problem as Big Mike.  Hey, wait, wait.  What's your name?  Oh, Gary.  But it's 14-year-old Gary.  You're 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah, I'm not 12-year-old Gary.  12-year-old Gary.  You know what?  He used to be 11-year-old Gary, but he had a birthday recently.  Dude, if this guy doesn't sound exactly like Gary's going to sound in two years, though, 
[02:25:30]  listen to him.  Listen to his voice.  Yeah, it's close.  He's got the same tone.  So, what's up?  You're 14-year-old Gary.  What happened?  My dad's 67 and my mom is 50.  12-year-old Gary from the future.  Wait, your dad is 67 and your mom is 50?  Yeah.  And she just got pregnant?  No, I'm 14-year-old.  14?  Yeah, my parents got me conceived to 50.  Your dad was 53 when your mom had you.  And your mom was 36, I guess? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And it's pretty sick because every time when I go outside with my dad and I'm with my  friends, they're like, hey, how's your grandpa doing?  That's my dad.  And then when I go with my mom, it's like, hi, hello, are you Gary's grandma?  Oh.  So, every time I was getting embarrassed for that.  Yeah, Gary, do you, uh, and Gary, your friends, like, you know, they have the hot moms that  are like 30.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, you have some of the moms around the school that are hot, you know? 
[02:26:30]  None of your friends want to come over to your house to check out your mom, right?  No.  Because I used to go over to this one kid's house in high school all the time because  he had the hot mom.  The hot mom.  The young hot mom.  That offered the hot chocolate.  Looking at the creamy thighs.  Hold on.  But it feels pretty sick.  Hey, Gary, would you, uh, would you rather be dead than be made fun of, or is it better  to be alive than be made fun of?  It's better to be alive.  Then shut your ass up and go home, stupid. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, Gary.  Yeah?  I think someone's on the phone and wants to talk to you.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's 12-year-old Gary.  Hang on the phone, you want to be.  You'll never be like me.  Come on, Gary.  You're a 60-year-old mother and father.  Hang up.  I'm not going to hang up, you skink.  Hang up.  You want to be bastard.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up, Gary.  That all you can say is friggin' you.  You're not. 
[02:27:30]  Goodbye.  Hang up the phone.  Hang up the phone.  Hang up.  I must say, I'm enjoying 14-year-old Gary.  He's got a certain maturity in his voice that you're lacking, 12-year-old Gary.  You might have a little more heat than 12-year-old Gary.  No.  No, never.  We're on a new kick on the O&A show.  Out with the old, in with the new.  You're not kicking me off.  I'm kicking me off.  I'm thinking, I'm calling Anthony Anthony, you stalker.  I'm a stalker.  Look who's talking, wannabe.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah? 
[02:28:00]  You want to go to a hockey game?  No, man.  I can't go.  Why?  I got great seats, man.  Right behind the goal.  Well, I can go.  You can?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to put you on hold, and I'm going to take you to a hockey game.  You son of a bitch.  Wait, wait, wait.  You kids and your new language.  Hold on, you.  You're going to be kidding me.  Hold on, you crazy kid.  Gary, you're coming in tomorrow, right?  Yes.  12-year-old Gary.  Well, I don't think you should.  I think you should cancel and bring in 14-year-old Gary. 
[02:28:30]  I think I like 14-year-old Gary.  I think so, too.  What do you think the listeners think?  Maybe we should let the listeners decide.  Hey, listen, I'm a listener.  I think Craig and 10.  Yeah, let's ask Craig.  All right, hold on.  This might screw up everything.  Let's try this.  Craig, what's up?  Yeah, 14-year-old Gary rules.  Get rid of 12.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Get rid of him.  All right, hold on.  Let me get these guys.  I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  What?  I like the 12-year-old Gary.  We're on a new kick, though.  He's out of loyalty to the show that I think we shouldn't throw him away.  Stop being a pussy.  Let it go.  12-year-old Gary.  Yeah.  I think you're cool, and you're coming in tomorrow.  Yeah.  I like 14-year-old Gary.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  What do you want to say to 12-year-old Gary?  You suck.  Your mother does, too.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  You're trying to do it.  Try me.  Try me.  You tramp.  Look who's talking. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, 14-year-old Gary, how tall are you?  I'm about 6'1".  Wow.  Whoa.  Yeah, I'm 6'1".  Man, that puberty's a bitch, isn't it?  Yeah.  6'1", where you got those big flipper feet.  6'1", and he's 14, so he's in the ninth grade, man, and he's taller than everybody else  in high school, pretty much.  You play basketball?  No.  Actually, there's other kids that are taller than me.  How much do you weigh there, 14-year-old Gary?  I'm only 150.  150.  150.  12-year-old Gary, only 5 foot, but puberty's right around the corner, my friend. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, that's what he says.  See what you're going to get forward to?  Yep.  What happened to his girlfriend?  Hey, 12-year-old Gary, you okay?  No.  No.  Hey, 12-year-old Gary.  You're on, pal.  12-year-old Gary, what's wrong?  Hey, 12-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  You're coming in tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  What's the heck to have you?  I can't have a 12-year-old cry.  Come on, Gary.  Oh, come on.  This is bad for the show, bro.  You made a 12-year-old cry.  This is going to be on the news, man. 
[02:30:30]  Gary, you know you're our pal, right?  Yeah.  What's wrong, 12-year-old Gary?  You know, if you put this friggin' wannabe bastard on this airway, I would box him so his  face and his skull found a friggin' heart.  You think I'm joking, don't you?  Yes, I think you are.  Yeah, you little pervert bastard.  Shut up, you tramp.  Gary?  Yeah?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm all right.  No, no, 12-year-old Gary.  I don't care.  12-year-old Gary, you're cool, right? 
[02:31:00]  12-year-old Gary?  Yeah, me.  Yeah, everything's fine, right?  You sure?  You're not upset with us or anything.  I'm not upset with you.  I'm just upset with this wannabe bastard.  All right.  I bet his name is leaving Gary.  I bet Eddie needs to embarrass the friggin' his name on the radio.  Hey, ma'am, my middle name's Edward.  Sorry about that.  All right.  No offense about you.  Are your feelings hurt, Gary?  No.  12-year-old Gary?  No.  Just because 14-year-old Gary is older and puberty has hit and he's probably getting laid 
[02:31:30]  like crazy?  No.  He's right around the corner for me.  Hey, 14-year-old Gary.  Yeah?  You want to come in tomorrow?  I can't.  Why?  Got school.  Oh.  Hey, 12-year-old Gary.  Yeah.  Why don't you have school tomorrow?  I have school.  Then how are you coming into the show?  My dad's taking me out early, I guess.  Oh, a little early.  Yeah.  All right.  See, that's kind of cool of his dad, 14-year-old Gary.  Well, you got a 60-year-old dad with that friggin' mini wagon. 
[02:32:00]  Shut your mouth.  From the 1980s.  Shut the f**k up.  Hey, Gary, watch the F-bomb.  I'm sorry.  12-year-old Gary.  He's going to start talking about the little wooden side panels and he stopped them.  14-year-old Gary, relax.  I think 12-year-old Gary got your sensitive spot there.  Yeah.  He's very protective of his 67-year-old dad there.  Well, I'm very protective of you guys. 
[02:32:30]  And if I lose you, I'm going to get pissed off.  Well, eventually it's going to be out with the old and with the new.  I think 12-year-old Gary still has enough.  I think you got time, though, 12-year-old Gary.  I think you'll at least make it to 13-year-old Gary before we start thinking of replacing you.  Yep.  And then by the time I'm 13-year-old Gary, he'll be 15-year-old Gary.  Wow, you're really intelligent.  What?  He said you're really intelligent because you can count.  Yeah, he said you're good at math.  Yeah, look who's talking.  Can you count how old your dad was when he was born? 
[02:33:00]  Well, 14-year-old Gary's dad was 53.  But who's keeping track there?  Gary, how old was your dad when you were born?  14-years-old.  In the 30s.  In his 30s?  In his 30s.  All right.  Yeah, stop lying, Gary.  Your dad was 14.  Isn't that funny?  Gary's dad was in his 30s.  No, no, no, no, no.  And 14-year-old Gary's was born in the 30s.  No, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.  You can't talk about my father.  He wasn't 13, so shut your mouth. 
[02:33:30]  You weren't around.  I'm guaranteeing your father was like two when he had you.  Yeah, okay.  Two?  Whatever, I don't care.  Gary, you were doing well.  Congratulations.  What happened?  You were doing well there.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm pissed off.  No, my mind's not working.  I'm freaking pissed off.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll see you tomorrow, 12-year-old Gary.  All right.  Hold on.  There's another Gary that wants to be a new character on our show.  Gary?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a new character for you guys, a 28-year-old Gary. 
[02:34:00]  I'm divorced.  I work for Xerox.  And I think both those Garys are just play-a-haters.  Hey, no, I think that you guys are all the same person.  Is your mom named Meg Korn?  No, actually I'm not.  I'm definitely not the 14-year-old.  Hey, 28-year-old Gary, you want to go to a hockey game?  Because at least we can go to a bar.  Can I go to the one where they're playing the Rangers?  28-year-old Gary. 
[02:34:30]  I kind of like 28-year-old Gary.  Yeah.  He's like, you can hang and have some beers, right?  There's someone you can at least hang with.  Yeah, exactly.  And you don't have to get them home by 10.  Actually, 11.  I think it's some wild back to the future thing.  But yeah, but thank you, 28-year-old Gary.  12-year-old Gary should look at these other guys and see where his life is headed.  So in two years, you're going to be a little snappy.  Right.  But by the time you're 28, you're going to be balding.  You're going to lose your job.  Hell no.  Look where your life's going. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, you're making fun of Carl's men, see?  Well, you know, he's jumping on my back.  I'll jump on his back.  That's beautiful.  Gary don't take no stuff.  I take nothing from anybody.  He almost cried.  And look, he's coming back strong in the late rounds.  So you see, I still have heat, even when I'm down.  Wow.  All right, 14-year-old Gary, you got any final words for 12-year-old Gary?  You suck, Gary.  Your mother does, too. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  All right.  There we go.  14-year-old Gary, keep in touch.  All right.  Then I'll call maybe tomorrow.  Yeah, we like the 14-year-old Gary.  We're going to try to develop you as a new character.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We'll see how the fans take you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  12-year-old Gary, we'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  See you guys.  The voice is the same.  It's just that two-year difference.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  If we could have gotten like an 18 and a 22-year-old Gary, that would have been the whole story.  I'm telling you, man. 
[02:36:00]  The Gary collection.  You know, at 22, things are looking good.  I might play basketball.  I got accepted to NYC.  It's going to rock.  You know what I mean?  We can do that tomorrow when he comes in.  We'll just have a whole spectrum of Gary's and Gary can see his life.  Yeah.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  The only thing that could have improved that last exchange was 12-year-old Gary saying,  get in the box.  Die, whore bag.  Get in the box.  Yeah.  Too bad 12-year-old Gary doesn't have that French accent.  Oh, yeah.  Carlos Mencia.  We're going to catch up with our pal next, okay?  Yes.  He's doing something for Comedy Central. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And he has to deal with the TV censors.  Yeah.  The horror.  All right.  We'll talk about it next.  Die, die, die.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Acting hilarious.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else, including Boston. 
[02:37:00]  Boston.  We're just tuning in.  We got great news from Boston.  We did real well in the ratings up there in Boston.  We're more gooder this time around and want to thank everyone up there.  More gooder.  We're supporting the show.  Rich Voss is in the studio.  Voss, what's up, man?  He looks like a proud papa.  I'm not a proud papa.  He's introducing Patrice to Aunt Nye and our listeners.  Patrice is a really funny guy.  I met Patrice a few times there at Caroline's. 
[02:37:30]  Probably one of the funniest comics out there.  He's a creep as a human.  Is he funnier than you?  Yes.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody who hasn't seen me and seen Voss, they know I'm funny.  I like when Voss is plowing through the same old crap.  It's awful, isn't it?  He's wrong, right?  Lenny Bruce got more new jokes.  And he sells a CD with the same material that he said. 
[02:38:00]  Voss won't.  Even his improvs.  Voss improvs yesterday's stuff.  I came up with a couple new bits.  Go ahead, say one.  Give us one of your new bits.  I don't know.  Let me think about, oh, here's a new one who really gets on my nerves.  Jared from Subway.  I hope he gains all his weight back.  Right?  In the text when I'm doing it on stage.  He lost 300 pounds eating subs. 
[02:38:30]  I go, what was he eating before?  Now, can you tell that he's making this, he wrote this down.  No, he didn't.  I don't want to stop people from eating.  Rich Voss has made that up yesterday.  He wrote it down.  He's trying it here.  No, I'm not.  What he's going to end up doing is, basically, hey, everybody.  Wants to go white.  Woss!  Woss! 
[02:39:00]  It's a new joke.  Wants to go black.  You never go back home.  Woss!  Woss!  It's new.  It's a new joke.  Buy my CD.  You're doing it.  Buy somebody.  Is Jared even doing those commercials anymore?  Yeah, they show on.  I haven't seen it.  Listen, Rich Voss always comes up with new stuff all the time.  Hey, now, Mary, did you see me the other night perform? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, they sent her up.  Yeah?  You were wonderful.  Well, how funny was that?  You were very funny, and he got me dinner, too.  Oh, see that?  He didn't pay for it, but he got it for me.  Yeah, I hooked you up, right?  Yes.  With a salad?  Yes, you did.  All right, we're done with you.  Call.  What do you think of our new furniture outside the studio?  That's nice.  We're jazzing up the place.  What's that?  The vinyl or whatever?  Sort of spoo slides off.  What is that crap out there?  I don't know.  It's like the furniture that they brought in.  It looks like Greg Brady's attic bedroom now. 
[02:40:00]  Don't you feel like you're on the real world set or something?  No, I wouldn't put that in a summer beach house.  It's really ugly.  It really is.  I like the old stained stuff that was in here.  Because you know, at least when I talk, I'm going to slobber and I'm not going to feel  guilty.  That stuff is horrible.  Who picked it out?  Patrice is just shaking his head out.  Patrice is like, you're saying nothing.  What?  I'm just talking.  If you see these guys down at Caroline's, Voss will be up there.  He'll be doing his act.  And Patrice is sitting by the kitchen door, kind of pretty far away, just mocking Voss the 
[02:40:30]  whole time.  It's awful.  No, he's sitting by the kitchen door waiting for food.  I'm fat, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a fat joke.  You're fat.  People can't see me on the radio, Voss, but I'm a fat guy.  You are a buffet molester.  You're not fat.  Jesus Christ.  You're fat.  Now stop insulting me.  It's the year 2006, Rich.  His jokes are old.  His car is old.  Did you?  Yeah.  We're talking about this car. 
[02:41:00]  Is everybody talking about this car?  He's making payments on an 89...  Wait, but here's the thing.  You're making payments?  He's got the janitors, like the rich janitor, bins.  It's not even like...  It's the bins they make for people that...  But that's Voss.  You ever see him?  Voss, his shirt's dirty.  It's DKNY.  Voss, but it's filthy.  I can't even fight back. 
[02:41:30]  Voss, this car stinks.  It's 1982.  You're trash machines.  It's a machine.  And you're paying for this?  You're making payments?  Yeah.  Did he tell you he's making payments?  Wait, wait.  Did I tell you what the number was?  Did I tell you what the number was?  No, it isn't.  190E.  Yeah, it's a 190E.  Look, it's a clean-looking Mercedes. 
[02:42:00]  It stinks.  It's a...  Nobody has a 190E.  I never even heard of that.  You're a big black man.  You're driving a Cadillac.  I'm supposed to.  You're a junior.  You're driving a Mercedes.  That's only because...  That's only because...  They trade at least something.  That's only because you couldn't get it.  Driving a Nazi car, not even a good one.  I'm driving a bad Nazi car.  You suck.  Oh, man.  Here's what Rich bought.  This is what he thought.  This is what he thought when he came up here.  Just real quick.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to hog this.  No, hell not.  This is what he thought. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  He says, she's thinking, I'm just...  Enough with a slobber.  That's what I'm trying to just...  Some people distinguish.  She's talking about you instead of just talking.  This is what he thought.  He thought, hey, I'm...  Because him and Norton, for some reason, they think they're goodfellas now.  For some reason, they want to pay for meals now.  They point at you when they talk.  Hey, hey.  Everybody's Italian, even at Chinese restaurants.  Hey, oh, hey there.  Hi, yeah.  And this is what he thought.  He thinks he's a made man.  He's going to bring me up an Opie and Anthony show and make a complete jagass out of me. 
[02:43:00]  Because he's a regular guest.  He's like, come on in, everybody.  Hey, Patricia, this is a pinball machine that's broke.  Hey, secretariat.  Hey, everybody.  Like, he's bringing me through the back entrance, and the goodfellas like...  He thinks he's Ray Liotta now.  He sucks.  He's using you just to get airtime.  You know that, right?  That's what he does right there.  We would never have him on Facebook.  Did he tell you he is a regular guest?  The regular guest, though, that everyone goofs on. 
[02:43:30]  He stinks.  This is what he thought.  He said, okay, I'm going to bring on some new guys.  But you didn't realize they can't see fat over the radio ball.  But they can hear...  Boss, you notice how you were whisked right into the studio?  Yeah.  As soon as you got here?  Yeah.  I didn't get it back.  Think about it.  Oh, okay.  Boss killed when he had someone to goof on in this studio.  No, listen, I never fail for you guys.  We're all team players.  I didn't bring him up here thinking, hey, I'm going to crack on you.  I don't care about you.  No, I didn't.  What am I going to say possibly about you? 
[02:44:00]  No.  You absolutely did, Boss.  No, I don't like how you try to use me like I'm the new kid at recess.  No.  Not at all.  They call me and say, you know, whatever.  We've been trying to get you on the show for a while, Patrice.  Yeah.  That is the truth.  Listen, if your phone was turned on and they could have called you, then you would have  known that.  There you go.  Black people's phones ain't turned on.  No, yours aren't.  Yours isn't, okay?  See, and whenever I come back to you, you're going to go, oh, the whole black people thing.  You know, it's you.  You.  It has nothing to do with black people.  Do you like his black humor there, Patrice? 
[02:44:30]  It's, I mean, yeah.  The wallet joke and the fried chicken, the coochie fried.  Every black comic on Earth talks about white people.  Not really.  I don't.  Who?  Yes, you do.  No, no.  You don't talk about white people?  No.  No?  I could say about ten of them.  When I'm walking down the street, some white lady's walking at me and I'm thinking,  you know, or I'm scared.  That's reflective on me.  You're talking about what I think.  I'm just saying white people's phones work, black people's don't.  Well, I'm generalizing.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you saying?  White people. 
[02:45:00]  White people.  Well, no, you don't do that, Debbie.  White people talk like, oh, yeah.  Well, no, white ladies fall like the monster movie.  That's what I do.  No, you don't do that.  You don't lie.  You don't do that like white people are crazy, white people pay taxes.  You don't do that.  I get nervous.  White people support their kids.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  Well, I don't remember what I do because I'm moving on to new material.  They get up early for work, white people.  White people, they crazy.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  White people, they crazy.  They see their kids once or twice a year.  No, see, you do the regular stuff about white people. 
[02:45:30]  White people crazy.  That's not me.  They got bank accounts.  Now he's making up stuff.  White people crazy.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's not on his CD.  They like girls with small asses.  All that stuff is not on his CD.  Stop using me as a black guinea pig.  I don't like that.  I'm not.  I'm just saying, you talk about white people.  Voss, say one of my jokes.  I try not to remember your act.  Say one of my jokes.  Listen, you do the one about if a white lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it. 
[02:46:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's white.  That's very funny, though.  It is funny.  It's not funny.  Yes.  How about if a lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it?  Why has it got to be a white lady?  Of course, if a white lady is killed in real life, you're going to look at black people.  Because it's funny when I say white lady, Voss.  But it's funny when I say black people.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It is.  They feel bad for you, Rich.  No.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Wait.  Wait.  When we're doing...  Okay, here's the deal.  22 years in the business. 
[02:46:30]  Listen to me.  A rule for all black...  A rule for all black comics.  I mean, all black audience.  Yeah.  Right?  You're on stage, Armand.  Who's going to do better?  Me!  Yeah?  Let's get your old Apollo tape.  Let's get your Apollo tape.  I got booed once.  You got booed 17 times, and you think black people love you.  No.  They hate you like white people, like Jews.  No one likes you.  What happened at the Apollo?  I got booed right off the...  How did that happen?  You got booed at the Apollo?  I came out there nice and arrogant.  You know, I didn't come out there. 
[02:47:00]  What's up?  What's up?  I had the one up there where, yo...  Yeah, Apollo.  I expected the same reaction I'd get at Caroline's.  Nothing.  You know what you got to come out for the Apollo?  You come out in an Asian guy mask, and they will love you.  I have seen...  I've watched every goddamn episode of Showtime at the Apollo, and they love...  They love when the Asian, like...  They could do 80s breakdancing.  Oh, right, right.  They could do 80s breakdancing.  They got like the...  And we got this Japanese troupe over there that don't speak a word of English.  They go, oh, oh.  And the music starts. 
[02:47:30]  The whole crowd goes, wah!  They go crazy.  And if they sing gospel, that's even yamble.  Oh, yeah.  A Chinese guy singing gospel on his phone.  Oh, yeah.  Forget it.  He's 20 weeks in a row.  He's winning.  I got booed right off.  Really?  Too arrogant, you think?  Yeah.  That came out nice and like I was funny.  Yeah.  I got a big, fat lesson.  They're not going to show it, though, because I curse.  I may show up.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  You got to do it.  Show this.  That's smart.  Yeah, it is.  Hey, Elisa from Cleveland has a problem today. 
[02:48:00]  Elisa, what's up?  Oh, bummer.  It says, on her period, but wants sex, even just oral, boyfriend, what to do, what to do.  Elisa, we lose you?  No.  So now you're having your time, is that okay, and your boyfriend doesn't touch you when  you're doing this?  Yeah, I don't know what his time is.  He doesn't want to get freaky or anything.  You know, it's like, I'm on my rag, and I've been on my rag for months.  See, I started taking my birth control shows.  Maybe it's the way you put it.  No.  Okay, look.  Well, hey.  I'm on my rag. 
[02:48:30]  For months, maybe you're a good guy.  Hey, bag, same thing.  And see, I haven't had any sex because he doesn't want to do anything, and it's pissing me off.  He doesn't want to do anything.  And I'm a freak like that, and I like to...  So he's not into the crime scene sex.  Crime scene sex is perfectly acceptable.  Just do it on...  You guys into the crime scene sex?  Darker sheets.  No, no.  You don't do that?  No?  I don't mind committing a crime against sex, but I'm not...  You won't...  I make my girl sleep on the floor when she's on a period.  Really?  What?  I don't even touch her.  Nasty. 
[02:49:00]  Stinking.  Pretty ugly.  Now it's bleeding.  You should be willing to touch her no matter what that's your girl.  Wow.  She only bleeds for four days on the floor.  Okay, I'm not asking you to do something every night.  A month of bleeding from that mess.  I don't even know if that made the error.  That's hilarious.  I don't know.  God damn.  Yeah, I don't...  You know something?  I got no problem.  The guy should have...  He should dive right in there.  Yeah, there's no gray area with that one, man.  You're either into it or not. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  I'm saying, what should I say to him?  Say F me or I'll find someone that will.  I don't get him going.  It's not blood.  I can't do that.  I've been with this guy for like two years.  It's all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, it's eggs and...  It's like a puree.  And it's cleansing.  If he was just bleeding like it was a wound, it would be different.  Yeah, but I'm saying, see, and I'm almost off and it's not even all that bad anymore.  So what did I tell you?  It's like, it's almost done and he still won't do anything.  It's been like two weeks since he's touched me and it's like...  Maybe he just doesn't want to have sex with you. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, hey, watch that language.  Watch that language.  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah, yeah.  Long, blonde hair.  Yeah, how do you?  Yeah.  What else do you want to know?  On a one to ten, what are you?  Huh?  On a one to ten scale, what are you?  And you've got to be an eight.  On a personal opinion?  No, from the guy down the block.  Yeah, personal opinion.  I'll give myself an eight.  I'll be in Cleveland next week.  Well, if it's, if it's like Patrice said, if it's looked like a regular wound blood, if 
[02:50:30]  it's like a, what, like ragu marinara, you don't want to, no, nothing even near there.  If it was that bad, I wouldn't ask him to do anything.  It looks like cacciatore.  Chunks of peppers and onions.  I'll have fun stuff also.  Sure.  It looks like salsa.  Well, maybe he's got a point now that I think about it.  All right, Elizabeth.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah.  We can't help you today. 
[02:51:00]  You're either into it or not.  All right.  Thanks anyway, you guys.  All right.  Big Al, you no get period for a month.  She's dying.  She's making a quick diagnosis.  She's dying.  She's dying.  I don't know.  Jimmy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, boss.  What's up?  And the words from Jim Norton, you stink.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.
