<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, proudly declaring themselves "radio shock jocks," setting a tone of irreverent humor and offensive banter.  Jim Norton, visibly unwell, was a target for their teasing. Opie shared a dream about a threesome, and the hosts engaged in their typical back-and-forth insults. Opie then showcased old personal belongings, including a too-small leather jacket deemed "gay" by him when worn by another studio person named Steve, and archival material from past radio shows and TV appearances featuring a character called "Spuds Buckley."  This led to reminiscing about their Boston days, recalling two infamous 1996 radio stunts: a "sperm bowl" challenge involving their sperm samples and a prank war with WABU-TV that included a bra-bombing attempt from a hot air balloon.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to speculating on Heath Ledger's death, filled with dark humor and conspiracy theories involving Mary-Kate Olsen and suggesting foul play.  They criticized Larry King's interviewing style, deeming it lazy, playing audio clips to illustrate their point.  The Ultimate Warrior's blog post on Ledger's death was read and mocked for its incoherence, compared to Hulk Hogan's parenting.  Bob Kelly joined Jim Norton in the studio at some point during the earlier segment.

The show culminated in a protracted, obscenity-laced letter-writing session, where the hosts drafted an angry missive to Vince McMahon, expressing extreme displeasure with a terrible WWE-provided breakfast, threatening to blow up the breakfast and WWE staff. This letter was sent to various WWE contacts.  The show's audio included snippets from older shows, showcasing a shift from energetic exuberance to cynicism,  featuring "FU Friday" segments and the cringe-worthy "Sperm Bowl" teaser, full of crude and sexually explicit material.  Further segments included discussions around Bigfoot on Mars,  poorly made Patriots Super Bowl songs from 1985, and an early recording by Chris Angel.  This portion also involved listener calls and commentary.

A trivia question about a failed musician turned successful celebrity, revealed to be Chris Angel, launched a discussion of the film *Scarface*, its cheesy 80s elements, and Al Pacino’s acting. This transitioned to a discussion of a recent Mike and Mike roast, focusing on an intoxicated ESPN anchor's vulgar behavior which led to her suspension.  Jeffrey Ross, a guest comedian, recounted the details of the event.  They discussed the varying degrees of harshness and audience reactions to roasts of Carrot Top, Flava Flav, Pat Cooper, and Jerry Lewis, also mentioning anecdotes about other roasts and comedians like Greg Giraldo, Steve-O, and Keith Robinson.


Professional wrestler MVP (Montel Vontavious Porter) joined the show, engaging in banter with the hosts about his wrestling career, including his win against Chris Benoit and his prison experience (nine and a half years, starting at age 16, for armed robbery and kidnapping during a casino heist on a cruise ship).  The conversation, often crude and humorous, included details about prison life, including solitary confinement.  He discussed his relationship with Chris Benoit, his feud with Ric Flair, and his career progression from prison to WWE success.  Other wrestlers like The Rock, Ric Flair, and Brock Lesnar and basketball player Stephon Marbury were mentioned, along with Sam, a co-host, who asked questions about MVP's career. The segment also discussed MVP’s future, including a book deal.

A later segment with MVP explored his large audiences, performance anxieties, and upcoming match against Ric Flair. He discussed his impending divorce, joking about his soon-to-be ex-wife’s settlement and the difference between a "bad guy" and a "heel" in wrestling.  He shared intensely negative fan reactions, including threats of violence, comparing the intensity of Opie and Anthony’s fans and wrestling fans.  The physical attributes of other wrestlers like The Big Show were described.  An anecdote about a fan, “Stalker Patty,” highlighted unusual fan encounters.  The show concluded with plugs for wrestling events, other radio shows (Ron and Fez), stand-up comedy shows, final jokes, and the "line of the day" segment, which included highly offensive language and the playfully throwing of bagels at E-Rock.

[00:09:30]  only the only picture of spuds buckley the spuds buckley yes spuds buckley a picture when i was doing  overnights in buffalo i helped the morning show out and uh i developed a character called spuds  buckley what are you uh dressed in and it's it's it's gonna be kind of a letdown but uh you know  you'll you'll see it's a black it's a black and white photo that i found at the bottom of this box 
[00:10:00]  last night i meant to bring it in today i forgot so i'll bring it in monday i promise and we'll put it  up on the websites you have glasses on it i got like bad like sunglasses a bad bandana okay it's  good enough right there right there is worth the price of admission really tight sweats because i'm  wearing like two or three layers of sweats because it's cold out and then a winter coat that was that  was the attire of the famous you're gonna be very disappointed but opie what was spuds like 
[00:10:30]  personality i don't know i forgot i don't i don't really remember if you had to guess yeah i can't  even guess what was he silly i'll tell you this much jimmy i just might find a audio tape of  spuds buckling i'm just starting to go through the boxes i got real rock tv stuff that i'm bringing  in that's a little frightening i i don't think i want to i don't think i want to see that that's  when aunt and i were doing a local tv show in boston i mean the whole station did the show with us  but we let's be honest we were the stars of the show we got the course stop it and i got every 
[00:11:00]  episode and i'm going to start bringing those in and we'll be posting uh uh clips of that online  and what else oh and yesterday i gave e-rock a cassette i didn't even think this cassette was  going to work it's so old it was dusty the label was you could barely tell what the label was it was  peeling off it was barely on the cassette uh-huh and i look at this thing i'm like oh my god it's a  radio show that aunt and i did oh no in 1996 oh no here's the cassette wow and uh e-rock is getting 
[00:11:30]  it together for monday's show it's two radio shows we did yeah back in 96 when we were in boston  and wow and this will prove to the people out there i this is the one thing that makes me laugh  the hardest when i i read fan sites they were so much better when they were on aam  what was that the the fan talking they don't even come close to their new material 
[00:12:00]  blind cc blind cc blind cc copy paste copy paste copy paste pay attention to me i have something to say  on this message board i'm a douche in real life but pay attention to me i think i got something  i got something here they were so much better when they did afternoons on new go f yourself i'm  gonna prove all of you wrong because i got it i got a we sucked and we're willing to prove it what 
[00:12:30]  happened to jimmy oh i just wanted to acknowledge i think you were laughing so hard that you had to  like step away from the mic why did you admit it you laughed at me okay good um so so the first  example for all the people that think we did our best work when we were up in boston yeah i got uh  two shows from uh 1996 that i brought in uh random shows by the way because i've just begun going  through my radio stuff and uh well it's uh it's our famous uh uh can i guess we could say it uh sperm 
[00:13:00]  bowl yeah that we did in 1996 uh-huh where we uh where we uh yeah we had to give a sample yeah we got it  we gave a sample and uh have a a doctor um do a count yeah do a sperm count yeah to see who was  the most virile who's the most fertile yeah uh out of out of uh us yeah so we had to um separately of 
[00:13:30]  course go into another room and get a sample yeah uh and then give it to the doctor who then did the  count right and um the results the results might shock you that's right and uh that that's that's  what the show was uh it was very uh embarrassing uh it was very um difficult uh to um to achieve  to get the sample uh because of the circumstance and the um the broadcast that was going on the 
[00:14:00]  constant interruptions by phone calls into the room yeah uh to tell how things were going yeah  um but yeah that's that's that show uh i'll i'll tell you this much i was a bit gun shy that day and  it took a really long time oh my god that was another side bet was how long it would take to  uh to get the sample yeah and i um i'm listening to all this cool music and anthony's broadcasting 
[00:14:30]  while i'm trying to get my sample and then i started thinking about all the people that were  listening as i'm trying to get my sample and i was a bit gun shy but i finally got it done  it's amazing how you could actually get a sample yeah um when you're not in a state  that you would think you'd have to be in to uh get the sample right  so so i found that show and then on the other side was what was the what was the other show 
[00:15:00]  you rock i don't i barely remember the other show um it was a lot of music segging and then it goes  into a war against an uh wabu tv in boston what yeah we sure did pick our battles wow  us against wabu rebels it was day three in the ongoing war against wabu i don't remember that  at all was that the day i i think what that's all about they didn't want to do our tv show anymore 
[00:15:30]  they actually canceled it they canceled our tv show before it really started because of the  yeah yeah yeah uh your show was airing at midnight and they said it was uh it was deemed  unacceptable for the content yeah a little too uh risque so we took on this tv station for  canceling real rock tv we we found a we eventually found a home on it on a hispanic tv station it was  a spanish tv station yeah uh we were the only english speaking program yeah but before that 
[00:16:00]  we were supposed to be on this other tv station so what did we do because we were so mad yeah i  haven't gone through all of it yet but the the first 20 minutes of it is pretty much describing  the uh the camouflage that you decided to wear to the show that day and uh anthony's military ranking  oh my god i think i know what this one's i can't listen to it i won't be able to listen to that i 
[00:16:30]  think that's when we were collecting bras and i think then we were going to bomb the tv station with  all the bras okay look we sucked with come on i want to hear from those asses now they were  so much i mean he's curious you guys are going to bomb the tv station with bras i knew jimmy had  a perk up for that one yeah we were wild yeah we were crazy we were collecting a bunch of bras and 
[00:17:00]  we were just gonna uh bomb the tv station with bras yeah panties at the flagpole yeah we're crazy  and i think um i think we were trying to make everyone believe that we actually rented i'm  starting to remember this no don't remember it stop keep it blocked because i don't want to hear it  i think oh i think we rented a um an air balloon for the day put a hot air balloon yeah we we said we 
[00:17:30]  we we got a hot air balloon and we were going to drop the bras on who why who cares and uh  they were in a frenzy because uh the stupid tv station bought into it and they thought we were  actually doing it and we were going to bomb them with bras the tv station from a hot air balloon as  we're wearing i am um i want to apologize to anyone that listened back then this is the first cassette  i found there's hundreds we got to get a new section going i've been asking for this on our 
[00:18:00]  website which is the name of this radio show so we can't promote it because there might be a booby or  two on there uh we need a section on there called old school opian anthony and then like i don't know  a couple times a week it's old school opian anthony here they are in penthouse here they are uh here's a  picture of them doing this here's a picture of this here's a video of this here's an old radio bit  okay can we get that done immediately it's called old school opian anthony i'm looking at a picture of us

[00:23:30]  beginning man i i do have complete shows for my bab days most of the abuse is going to be  pointed at me because unfortunately i didn't i didn't uh tape full shows at af i got a i got a  few i got maybe a dozen or so dude all we're up there for three years so i might have like 20 full  shows maybe that that assault on that tv station i remember it's gonna be because now it's things  are starting to come back to me and it's just it's awful we broadcast it from the ihop down the street 
[00:24:00]  from where bcn is now and i forgot the name of that road and there i think actually uh where bcn is  now in boston is the old tv station oh really i think they took up uh took over that space if i'm  not mistaken or close to it and we were at the ihop down the road broadcasting live and i remember  them running out of the building because they were completely convinced that we were going to attack  them with these dumb bras from a hot air balloon oh you guys didn't take any prisoners no and the 
[00:24:30]  description i'm sure we really got into it and oh my very excited a little too excited it'd be like  a storm of bras falling on them yeah but keep posting we were better at a half and better than  any w you dopes i'm scared i'm so scared you know why we were better than any w because that's  the only material that's available is when we were like having great shows you idiot yeah all the  crappy ones are just gone into the right we only was most yeah this is before people were taping our 
[00:25:00]  show on their own so yeah uh pretty much anything you hear from the any w days that people think are  the glory years of uh the opian anthony show we gave you all the all the horrible horrible shows and  horrible breaks and days where we were hung over and barely barely there we buried that crap of course  the new w stuff's gonna sound great if it's if it's the greatest hits yeah effing dopes blind cc 
[00:25:30]  blind cc they need to go back to afternoons they were obviously so much better than copy paste  dopes opian anthony hey good morning opian anthony erock out of the studio cutting up some audio  i guess we're gonna get a little taste of some of that stuff i described to start the show off today 
[00:26:00]  we'll have to wait and see on that  anyway heath ledger yeah so we kind of talked about it right what happened well he died jimmy  oh you're kidding man how did it happen why are they burying the story  and uh i'm telling you i started uh saying this a couple days ago and uh finally people are catching 
[00:26:30]  up to me something is a miss a miss something is awry awry there's uh yeah there seems to be  a little bit of shenanigans going on the shenanigans the masseuse called what mary kate olsen three or  four times something like that waited yeah almost 10 minutes before she called nine one one nine one  and mary kate olsen sent her people over but i think her people got there at the same time the 
[00:27:00]  paramedics got there so you can't just assume that they got there before anyone else and was able to  clean up the room if you know what i mean clean up but i'm very suspicious i think uh i think this is  gonna get interesting i really do i'm going with the h i'm going with the hod yeah i'm doing  i'm gonna bet it's an hod something is really odd because phone calls were made phone calls were 
[00:27:30]  made from keith ledger's phone after he was dead to mary kate olsen who then sent her crack who knows  she had some crack security team that could be deployed like uh like swat she sent her own club  so did kenny yep okay mary kate i'll get rid of the heroin the heron what do you need you know  you could get in big trouble for this all right thank you so uh yeah they sent she sent a security 
[00:28:00]  her own private security over there yeah and uh they arrived before the police got there and the ems  so now there's all kinds of uh speculation uh did they take anything out of the room did they  clean up uh some type of drug use or or something else that might have been uh embarrassing or  detrimental to his legacy sure and uh now they're questioning mary kate olsen do you know jimmy 
[00:28:30]  hendrix would have lived if his girlfriend had called the cops right away and the drug and the  hospital right away when jimmy was overdosing she was so scared about a drug bust this dumb broad  wow waited a long time and this is not what happened here but she jimmy would have lived  i've never heard that before they said he would he would have he would have survived that but it  was like waited a couple hours before she called jeez a couple hours yep breaking news this one  breaking news so and now uh the masseuse they're looking into her she's not licensed to do massages 
[00:29:00]  uh and that's a felony she could uh they're saying she could spend four years in the joint she's  doing body work leave her a lot she's probably a body worker well the inside track yesterday hinting  that she did more than uh you know not with that face she looks like stallone that's not how i die  and it at first appears to be a woman  well i was in there with mr norton yes and then all of a sudden he didn't look too well 
[00:29:30]  the crooked wig like the black dude's man justice for all who hung himself like ralph ralph naggy  remember that ralph aggie ralph the black guy with the crooked wig yeah mr kirkland said i'd be out on  probation sorry um and he was dead for about two hours they're saying he died around 1 1 30  yeah and maybe that's why she didn't call 9-1-1 because it was very obvious still though you you 
[00:30:00]  don't know because uh the blood was settling what was that word again where the blood just kind of  lividity silent lividity silent lividity was setting in he uh yeah he he was i don't know though  you come in and there's somebody dead you call 9-1-1 immediately and she said uh cold to the  touch have you yeah have you ever touched a dead body nope don't wanna terrific don't wanna it's  really strange how cold the body gets after you die don't wanna it's like but but the body's a lot 
[00:30:30]  colder than the air around it what's that about how'd that happen i don't know it's it's downright  people like metal downright creepy because heat is leaving it huh because heat is leaving it coming  off the body oh yeah yeah i don't know what it is but i uh it it gives the impression that the body  is colder than the air around it i don't know i don't know if there's a term for that or what but  lividity lividity anyway uh this is quick the masseuse could have killed him 
[00:31:00]  all right now we're getting crazy z from long beach he's right yeah i'm just talking a little nutty now  why you gave him a good hammering to the head well i i went with blunt force to the head as my  first guess but i i've i've adjusted i'm going with the uh hod why would she make three phone calls  to mary kate olson of course as opposed to the other mary kate mary kate how is she involved in this  that's the oddest thing the little kid from that stupid tv show uh yeah the um to make phone calls 
[00:31:30]  to her and then she's calling back and security teams are coming in why would that happen unless  there's something a little suspicious that they're worried about yeah yeah that's what i'm thinking  why maybe uh maybe the masseuse did a little belushi to heath i think what happened was maybe she was the  one that uh might have delivered it i don't know something's up that's all i'm saying i think the 
[00:32:00]  masseuse killed him because she got sick of hearing push the finger please push that finger yeah wow  just being sick affects your delivery  i knew it was bombing and i said it again praying that it was just that it wasn't sure enough  see we get we get regular massages jimmy i know but you understood the joke it was just a terrible  all right i had none of the makings of a joke hey uh we got to do this fast uh we're all about 
[00:32:30]  this heath ledger thing and uh our our one of our favorite people larry king was all over this  because larry king he's all about uh pop culture and current events and uh trying to relate to the  average viewer the average youngster of 60 years old this this old badger this old this old codger  codger this old uh i need a good one curmudgeon curmudgeon who makes a bloody fortune to do that 
[00:33:00]  dumb show every night on cnn just doesn't belong in that seat now he's well past uh his prime  move up uh that uh anderson cooper guy he's he's just sitting there waiting  anderson pooper wow some people but he's sitting there waiting he's the he's the guy that's going  to be in that seat but there i guess what are they waiting for are they going to change to have like 
[00:33:30]  his 10th heart attack yeah are they going to change the little light bright set behind him i'm sure if uh  they bring in a new guy new set i don't get that man there's a lot of guys on tv that are just  they don't belong there anymore but for some reason they continue regis doesn't belong on tv  no i'm out of touch i don't know anything larry king doesn't belong on tv anymore but what this uh  keith ledger uh very tragic keith the death of keith ledger uh larry it's heath heath i was doing 
[00:34:00]  regis oh wow no you got oh it better be all right go ahead sorry regis i'm an idiot it's okay  it was obviously regis i gotta take the blame for that one it's all right that's all right but i was  all giddy because it's friday no we're giddy because we want to make sure a little jimmy is 
[00:34:30]  okay now he's drinking tea oh he's drinking tea you'll feel better lickety split you're doing  you got the tea you got the emergency you got the the mousinex i like to call mousinex me too  don't know d and then you got the coffee that's a lethal combination right now the coffee uh you know  no good but that's when i know i'm sick when i can't drink my 10 cups of coffee in two hours  uh so you want to hear what larry king was all about yes these are really quick we basically cut  it down to larry's dumb questions yeah and keep in mind the guy makes i i believe 20 million a year 
[00:35:00]  to do this to do this nice aj how big a story is this in new york  aj how big a story is this in new york well larry tell you the truth uh people are barely noticing  now larry works for cnn right so don't you think he'd know just from watching cnn how big of a  story it is yeah uh and is he really enlightening anybody he's a lazy interviewer yes how big of a 
[00:35:30]  story is this in new york let me write that one down that could be a good question if you've uh  read anything about larry king they say the brilliance of larry king is how he just keeps it very simple  oh it's simple all right i call it laziness simpleton because all you have to do is go how big of a  story is this in new york and then the guy does everything else for you yeah because he's gonna go  well obviously it's a big story larry and then he'll talk about all the stuff yeah and what did larry 
[00:36:00]  actually do there nothing  howard bragman he has a two-year-old daughter does he not he does he killed her broke up with his  fiancee right uh yeah i think september officially is australian right okay i lost what is there there's  a guy right now driving to his miserable job at a deli oh i want to say to that dude you could do this  job much better yeah wait a minute you get bullet points and that's all he did was uh two-year-old 
[00:36:30]  daughter australian recently separated who can't do that who's australian he's ledger's australian  oh wow you just learned that yes well how about that are you all right larry i didn't know that  are you all right yeah but i didn't know that let larry and he's australian  i love that can we confirm that right australia is in the southern hemisphere am i correct 
[00:37:00]  right part of this great blue marble we call earth he's ledger he was an actor right  good looking he was in that homo movie wasn't he with the cowboy hat am i correct to assume  he played the gay cowboy something about a mountain and someone breaking their back  did he spit in his hand and came up with a great one today in the office getting reports he was blonde 
[00:37:30]  is this correct and came up with a great one in the office you know because this heath ledger thing  is driving us all nuts at this point anthony's like they should just have like a b-roll of just  the horrific scenes from brokeback mountain oh as they give the updates on heath ledger well because  they just show him walking the red carpet maybe with his ex-wife and uh clips from uh some of his  movies even brokeback mountain but him with the cowboy hat kind of walking around they should just have 
[00:38:00]  that horrific tent scene right where he spits in his hand and shows jake gyllenhaal who the boss is  her to volta is a big big uh heath ledger fan he couldn't stop talking about how good he wasn't broke  back oh i bet oh to volta apparently he said he was a one he was one of his favorite actors well guess  who wasn't a fan of that uh that role god the paper well the paper is reporting that close well  the papers reporting that mel gibson uh kind of broke his ties uh with heath ledger after he did 
[00:38:30]  that movie they were in the patriot together heath ledger played uh so they were gibson's son so um  uh mel uh heath ledger kind of looked up to mel gibson asked him for advice a lot of times and  asked him about the role of uh the gay cowboy there in uh brokeback mountain and mel gibson said  no don't take it he strongly suggested that he uh pass on that role just based on his own uh wacky  morality right uh and of course he didn't take his advice he took the role it was a huge uh role for 
[00:39:00]  him and um it broke up the friendship that they had that's right he said and uh heath was a little  distraught about that know who else is uh your entertainment news there people know who else is okay  with the fact that he's ledger died the ultimate warrior the ultimate warrior he wrote a blog did  he yeah i thought the ultimate warrior was dead he wrote a blog i really i thought he was dead is he  is this the real ultimate warrior we got a wrestling expert in the studio is i thought he died no that 
[00:39:30]  was long rumored but there was always only one ultimate warrior and he never died and that's the  one back in like the early 90s with the face paint and that guy yep okay then it was a rumor  it's a rumor uh dead low dead long before 28 ultimate warriors blog in the interest of full  disclosure i must tell you i have watched brokeback mountain no less than 45 times is he making a joke  there at first i thought it was serious but yeah i think he might okay oh he was making light 
[00:40:00]  i think that's okay and i own the limited edition dvd signed by willie nelson a short time after  he wrote that can i i i need to read this without being dumped out of because they're going to use  the q word for the the g word you can say that because that's um all right uh that word is accepted  yeah okay it's even on television yeah straight guy i own the limited edition dvd signed by willie  nelson in a a shirt uh by signed by willie nelson a short time after he wrote that queer cowboy song 
[00:40:30]  as a tribute to to the courage of the producers and actors who broke such incredible creative ground  when they made their agenda agenda less movie serious until i saw bend over broke back braveheart  was my favorite movie but the love scenes of broke back sucked me right in and i had no choice  but to give myself over to the passion of its wide open range if you get my drift i think we get  your subtle such such courage this young man and his colleagues have reminds me of the courage of 
[00:41:00]  classic movie stars where during the war they enlisted and flew bomber planes and fought on front  lines then came back and picked up their lives and careers right where they left off without  anti-american sentiment whining and complaining or self-destructive self-indulgence going with this  equally inspired he's crazy he's not right he's a jerk off he's a jerk off his job it is to put a hat  on and throw people around the ring wow brilliant dude you've created you've really contributed a lot 
[00:41:30]  to the arts did he write this on sarcastic douche wednesday perhaps he was just getting in with the  uh spirit of our program yeah what he's doing right now is he's going after the movie with the agenda  like it's this really uh like it's this really cutting edge you know gritty american attack on liberal  hollywood i'll show you you're trashing a guy that took a role and did a great job as an actor  yeah um and that's what you're trashing he also played the joker you idiot yeah i mean that's not 
[00:42:00]  a big agenda what is he fighting for people with clown makeup on too apparently leather uh leather  yeah oh wow okay he said a ledger he changed his name apparently leather hedger had sleeping  troubles and anxiety and dealt with terrible mood swings so do soldiers but they don't self-destructively  f up their lives good tie-in that's a real american real gritty down-to-earth type of guy he's he's 
[00:42:30]  telling it like it is he is love it or leave it pal and love it or leave it like it or lump it that's  right good old america like soldiers when they're out on the field get to put on little hats and throw  each other around the ring that's what they're doing little they use funny names and throw each  other around with a little mask and tight pants that's what soldiers do you're you're right you're  right there with the soldiers he was a fruit who deserved to die but you're right there gritty  american yeah gritty american is he trying to say there's not a soldier out there that did exactly 
[00:43:00]  what heath ledger just did of course there is i mean wake up man what a tool  pretty much all of us support the troops but uh some of the soldiers have problems as well  but there's no tie-in it wasn't like heath ledger had a website soldierssuck.com yeah i i know  this makes no sense unless he unless he did something publicly comparing apples and oranges  i don't think he ever apples and bananas i don't think he ever said anything negative about the war or  our soldiers in fact they don't sleep handle anxiety and mood swings while dealing with whether or not 
[00:43:30]  they might at any moment lose their life they also don't fly in a private plane with vince  do they they fly on c-130s i'm sure ultimate warriors uh private plane privileges have been  revoked for years but you know what i'm saying it's get them off my plane and they do this all  the while they are dangerously protecting the freedom of others to f up their own by the way how  many 28 or older or younger year old soldiers met their death yesterday well that's true too we don't 
[00:44:00]  really pay attention to the deaths of our soldiers which pisses me off on a daily basis if you want  to know that then what this dummy should do is attack the media i wonder if he went after uh his uh his uh  benoit did he did he write a scathing blog of benoit and how soldiers uh don't get messed up and kill  their kids and their lives themselves that was it was a scathing blog right it's not easy to find out  none of them made the headlines of any news that is a good point something that uh i'm frustrated with  than uh the guys here in the studio are as well by today's standard uh though i do have to agree 
[00:44:30]  that he was a great father perhaps even greater than the father of the year hulk hogan after all  leather hedger did what it took to kill himself his kid is without a father yes but the negative  influence is now removed and his own child has the chance for a full recovery wow hogan on the other  hand won't go quite that far he insists on sticking around to keep further ruining and profiting off of  the apparently mismanaged lives of his own children it is sad and tragic that we don't 
[00:45:00]  demand attention be paid to greater things yeah like a like a washed up wrestler who's desperate to  be heard on a social issue who puts little hats on that's what he does you did nothing to earn the  right to be heard you see what happens when a dummy like that tries to be funny in writing you don't  have that gift do what you do which is act like a retard shoot things into your arm and go i'll get you  you guys that's what you do jerk off yeah so do that be the dumb jock bully that you are he's not 
[00:45:30]  uh uh there's not this sarcastic cutting wit and he's not making a social point that's relevant  he's all over the place well oh roger ebert hospitalized oh boy oh no i didn't know he's still alive  oh boy pudding head number two that's it that's number two he's got yeah well the uh siskel  died of the pudding head and i believe that ebert is uh sure to follow with these guys watch movies 
[00:46:00]  in a microwave no what the hell are they doing ebert will be dead by monday sitting with their  head leaning on the projector lamp it's over johnny  he's going in for his final review yeah god that annoyed me well i guess god just needs another movie  reviewer yes well yeah well you got a big uh big star up there now you need someone to review his  movies in heaven so this is perfect yeah perfect for god hey uh i would have preferred if he would 
[00:46:30]  have mentioned benoit though if you're gonna go after fathering skills of course oh right go after  one of your own like that huh well he's still for real take a risk you want to take a risk how about  that well how about you take that risk he won't you know never yeah why not i mean you know why  i mean if he's ledger was such a terrible father and hulk hogan's a terrible father why not because  he thinks vince is gonna call him someday yeah he's a he's ledger a horrible father for taking a role  as a gay guy it's obviously acting no he screwed up and you know we all feel like we know heath now 
[00:47:00]  and uh well yeah and i do believe he was a wonderful father to his young daughter matilda  and what is leather hedger i'll tell you what that is what does that mean well funny because there  was a gay thing which is like the leather thing leather instead of heath it's like a little word  play which a guy who whose whole job it was was to put on like a little a face thing and throw  others around on a fake mat and to go i got you down that's his idea being very funny that's funny 
[00:47:30]  writing he's probably pissed because he didn't get the role as the joker in the new batman movie  listen to this speaking of uh the ultimate warrior  you are nothing but a normal you don't deserve to breathe the same air that i and hulk hogan do  hulk hogan i must ask you now as you ask me do you hulk hogan what's your ideas your beliefs 
[00:48:00]  to live forever for hulk hogan in this normal world physically none of us can live forever  but the places you have taken the hulk of maniacs the ideas and the beliefs you have given them  can live through me hulk hogan  he he's an ass he is a complete ass hold on i gotta cleanse the palate 
[00:48:30]  obviously a guy who makes bright social statements you heard that yeah it's the guy who's oh look there  he is yeah there's some video of him with his little face paint on his mullet yeah and uh he's  this guy is supposed to make he's got paint on his chest and his face can we get this up on onaradio.com  good let's do that immediately look at his pharaoh faucet hair look at his teased hair 
[00:49:00]  he looks like he's getting ready to go on the view what an ass here we got another one it's short  that is why i breathe that is why the warriors have come oh hulk hogan there are ones that question  where you are taking them do you no longer want to walk or step into that darkness  oh hulk hogan the darkness i speak of is nothing to fear it is about the beliefs 
[00:49:30]  of accepting any and all challenges at the cost of losing everything oh hulk hogan  hulk hogan hulk hogan he can't even talk well he kind of says ho hogan hulk hogan  ho hogan what a cornball he's a cornball yeah we get it you're big and strong and stupid 
[00:50:00]  apparently he's dressed just like a soldier though what a dunce little heart painted on his chest and  and uh yeah t's little wig that's cute all right he's frosted hair yeah just like a soldier uh let's  uh let's uh do this we gotta take a break and we gotta get into some uh super bowl talk i think bob  kelly's coming by again today and who else oh uh jeffrey ross right yes and the great uh ron  bennington is calling to talk about today and uh i hold in my hand um uh me uh introing an stp record

[01:19:00]  what  turn off  the instant feedback  I can't do  this  oh my god  it's really  uncomfortable  more of those  tapes on Monday  and that's just  the beginning  it's a brand new  concept that we've  been talking about  for a long time  we're gonna  jump in  all the way  with this one  old school  Opie and Anthony  and of course  old school  Jim Norton  he's gonna bring  in some stuff  and then we got  Bob Kelly  he's gonna bring  in some stuff  and it's just  gonna be an  ongoing thing  for pretty much  the whole year  you know that  what's so humiliating  about my stuff 
[01:19:30]  this was a TV  taping  and it was like  I was just so  eager  and I was  kind of trying to  get out of that  character I used to  do  what all that  weird voice  character  I am sexy  was that one  of your jokes  was my opening  line  you know  cause I'm not  sexy  wow  that was an  opener  yeah  I feel  sexy  what happens 
[01:20:00]  I guess you  just get bitter  you just get  knocked down  so many times  that you get  bitter and then  all of a sudden  you make it  because I don't  get it  you get more  real  you get more  real probably  you're doing it  right  we all have that  if you're doing  it right  like  I'll tell  myself this  Carlin was  like you know  wearing a suit  when he first  started  and doing the  proper  you know  it's like  him prior  was doing  the clean  conch your  hair thing  so  we all go  through those  transition periods  mine just  lasted six  humiliating years  well ours  lasted a while  too  there  oh  god  did I suck 
[01:20:30]  too long  how we doing  so  highlights from  sperm bowl  96 on  Monday  and also  us  bombing  a local  TV station  from a  hot air  balloon  with a lot  of bras  with bras  yeah  anyway  yeah  look at  Bobby  sitting there  feeling good  about himself  I feel fantastic  this is like  oh I'm in a room  with these hacks  Bob Kelly  Stress Factory  tonight  tonight  I'm all flustered

[01:21:30]  that  were you in a  cherry picker  I don't  no we didn't  even do that  no  you were just  in a building  no we just  like  didn't do  anything  there's some  old radio shows  I remember  like we did  it yesterday  mayor's prank  comes to mind  and other things  this one I don't  remember so it's  going to be really  uncomfortable when we  hear it for the  first time in 12  years  and we'll do it  on Monday  all right listen  Larry King  we started with  this and went  off on a really  really long  tangent  but Larry King  you know  talking about  Heath Ledger 
[01:22:00]  this is just  terrific  he gets paid  the big bucks  because of his  interviewing skills  that are horrendous  horrible  absolutely horrible  as old and out  of touch  he really just  picks up on one  word of what  somebody just said  right  yeah he was  blue when he  walked in  so his favorite  color was blue  right  well that's  pretty accurate  because here we  go right back  to Larry  talking about  the Heath Ledger  thing from the  other night  you worked with  him on Brokeback  Mountain right  how did he  approach that role  he certainly was  not gay  ass first  from the rear 
[01:22:30]  of course  with a handful  of spit  he's backed  into it like  a UPS truck  he really did  spit in his  hand  he did  this is so  dumb  anyone can do  this  listen again  you worked  with him on  Brokeback Mountain  right  how did he  approach that  role  he certainly  was not  gay  oh I was  waiting for an  answer like the  guy was like  what  no we don't  even give a  crap about the 
[01:23:00]  answer  it's all about  Larry King  wasn't gay  was he  are there  photos  Larry  no I'm done  I was just  babbling  how important  is the  if you're  can't do the  bit he'll  how important  is it to  relax your  muscles  is it important  approaching this  role to  actually  another man  in the  do you think  he actually 
[01:23:30]  you know  but he's not  gay but  do you think  he actually  did he put  his in the  other guys  so he could  learn what it  feels like to  a guy  in the  because most  people don't  know if  you're not  gay what  it's like  or to have  a guys  in your  do you want  more or  what  sure  all right  man that's 
[01:24:00]  more words  than you  spoke in  the past  two weeks  hell that's  the most  I've spoken  a year  it's  brilliant  there's two  short lines  brilliant  obviously they're  watching a snippet  of Brokeback  Mountain and  that's all  Larry has  I'm doing  this scene  in acting  class by the  way  where's the  part where  he  him in  the  in the  tent  where he  spits in  his hand  grabs his 
[01:24:30]  and puts  it in  I'm  Larry King  did you say  you're doing  this in  acting class  yeah well  this is actually  before he died  but I think  it was like  three weeks  ago my  acting teacher  gave me  the scene  not that  scene it's  the scene  where he  goes I  can't quit  you  but I  play  Heath  does he  lube up a  piece of  garlic  is there  any  are you  still doing  Welch's  grape juice  does he  does he 
[01:25:00]  dip his  in Welch's  grape juice  are you  still doing  the scene  yeah I  have to  actually do  it  Monday  night  dude  can you  tape it  I gotta  hear that  the guy  I'm  doing with  is a  really  good  looking  actor  guy  and at  the  end  we get  into this  big fight  and then  I tell  him to  leave me  he says  I can't  quit you  Enos  when I  go just  leave  leave me  alone  let's do  some of  it  and then  he goes  to grab  me to  hold me  you want  to do  the lines  with  Kenny  sure 
[01:25:30]  you got  the script  I don't  have it on  me  but it's  online  get the  script  that Bobby's  working on  in acting  class  and Kenny  will read  lines  Kenny  you want  to read  lines  with Bob  Kelly  today  of course  GH  what an  ass  are we  doing a  radio show  today  by the way  or are we  just hanging  out  sometimes  it's  Friday  I get  confused  so this  is the  actual  scene  you're  doing  in acting  class  and we'll  help you

[01:27:30]  are they  living  of course  didn't you  see on the  news  first of  all  that his  parents  gave a  statement  that's  what I'm  getting  at  Larry  doesn't  even  do  just  the  basics  when it  comes  to  stuff  he  doesn't  even  watch  TV  to  understand  what's  going on  with the  subject  is he  from  parents  or was  it  immaculate  conception  is he  an alien  is he  on that  stupid  UFO show  that  Roland  made  everyone  watch  all 
[01:28:00]  right  let's  go  so what  he asked  if his  parents are  still alive  did not  ask that  his parents  got divorced  Pat  are they  living  I don't  know the  answer to  that Larry  I just  didn't have  to tell you  I don't  know the  answer to  that  Ben  do you  know  honestly  don't  know  I do  know  that his  family  has released  a statement  insisting  that he  has not  committed  suicide  from the  dead  not in  his  nature  the exact

[01:29:30]  supposedly  his  sister  tried  to  put  him  into  acting  so  he  could  really  have  a  cathartic  moment  was  his  fiance  actress  oh  yeah  she  was  also  in  Brokeback  Mountain  that's  what  wait  a minute  he  doesn't  even  know  they  were  married  you  dope  why  why  is  this  guy  on  my  TV  fiance  they're  separated  they were  married  they were  married  had a  kid  and then  were  separated  and  it's  and you  know what  can I  tell you  something  I didn't  know that  until a  few days  ago  but as  soon as  you find  out

[01:37:30]  with them  is tough  impossible  no way  you keep up  with that guy  free drinks  at the comedy  cellar  remember those  days Norton  I never drank  I was sober  three years  before I started  comedy  I just mean  in general  oh yeah  you ever reminisce  you ever reminisce  not really  it's been so many  years  I mean  it's all bad  memories  you should pick  it back up  oh my god  why would you  say that  it's fun  because it's fun  what's wrong  what's wrong  with you  what's wrong  with you  I have one  once in a while  I just don't  tell anybody  it's healthy  it's healthy  it's healthy  it's good for you  they always say  we're only as sick  as the things 
[01:38:00]  that we tell people  that wine's good  for you pop  I only drink  you know  like a few times  a year  I get like that  yeah  you decided  before the big  appearance  on the Opie  Anthony show  you know what  I really thought  I had it under  control  I got home  early enough  but I just  kept waking up  with bed spins  oh no  did you puke  that's bad  I don't puke  whatever reason  I just don't puke  I just stay like this  for half a day  feel like crap  I feel  I'm happy to see you guys  so I feel better  good company  that always helps  a hangover  good friends 
[01:38:30]  good friends  you guys are like  mishpacha  Bob Kelly is looking  for an apology today  because yesterday  on the show  he's like  hey did you guys see  I'm saying Bigfoot  on Mars  but what did you say  I actually said  it looked like Bigfoot  oh you did  okay  I did say that  alright I'm sorry  so Bob's like  hey you guys  check it out  man there's life  on Mars  there's a picture  of Bigfoot  on Mars  and now he wants  an apology  but I gotta remind  you Bob  you were the same  person that said  that you saw  a werewolf  in Iraq  I did see a werewolf  remember when he 
[01:39:00]  called the show  and talked about  how he saw  a werewolf  in Iraq  no no  I'm not gonna  ask Colin  shut up  it's gonna back  shut up  shut up  bite his finger  what's wrong  with you  you saw it  like sneaking  around  this is what  happened  we're in  Baghdad  we're at  the palace  down  down  in  Uday's palace  we're in  those little  trucks  I am the  werewolf  that's what we  saw  were you on the  list or how did  you get into 
[01:39:30]  Uday's palace  were you friends  with him  yeah I'm friends  this is before  this is before  years before  the war  he's cordially  invited  Saddam has  WMDs and  werewolves  we have to be  very careful  would have been  more believable  to tell you the  truth  Frankenstein  is entering  our airspace  are you done  the van 
[01:40:00]  stopped  just like  we were going  to hit  somebody  and then  a werewolf  walked by  the front  I like  to make  werewolf  movies  he's just  an Iraqi  he was an  Iraqi  who hadn't  shaved in a  while  was he on  his way  to Trader  Vicks  was his  hair  perfect  this I know  it was a  werewolf  because I 
[01:40:30]  looked at  the marine  the marine's  not gonna  marine's  not afraid  of anything  I looked  at the  marine  I go  first of  all it  had a  man  chest  like a  man  torso  because it  was a  man  right  of course  it was  and it  had a  wolf  and I  looked at  the marine  I go  they don't  have good  health care  in Iraq  so there  was some  weird thing  happening  to a  man  in Iraq  it was  a woman  without all  the stuff  on her  face  I looked  at the  marine  I go  what was  that  he goes  I have  no idea  I go 
[01:41:00]  was that  a werewolf  he goes  I don't  know  he was  scared  like  visibly  shaken  was it  at night  daytime  oh yeah  definitely  a werewolf  daytime  you don't  know that  that's true  I mean  they change  up the  vampire rules  every once  in a while  they can  change  up the  werewolf  rules  how do  they change  them up  they don't  really change  them up  sure they  do  in what  way  you know  some movies  the cross  works  some movies  the cross  doesn't work  the cross  doesn't work  for a werewolf  I said  on vampires  they could  change it up  for a werewolf 
[01:41:30]  silver bullet  maybe it's  not silver  maybe it's  platinum  it's the  face behind  the cross  that works  as was  pointed out  in Salem's  lot  oh right  it has  nothing to do  with just  the cross  the priest  was holding  the cross  up  and it was  glowing  not if it's  you finish  guys  sorry  you're right  you're right  I apologize  your ears  distracted  me  and he  was holding  it up  and it  started fading  because the  priest was  a drunk  and he  just took  it out  of the  priest's  hand and  crushed it  and he 
[01:42:00]  said it's  your faith  behind the  cross that  makes it  strong  that's his  logic  I'm just a  boy  that's not on a  captain vampire  though  like a number  one vampire  you didn't see  a werewolf in  Iraq and it's  not Bigfoot on  Mars  I didn't say it  was Bigfoot  I said it  might be  it's a dumb  shadow  it's either  Bigfoot or  Nessie  it's a rock  or something  why then is  Bigfoot's ass  the same color  as the surrounding  rocks  and if you say  he was just  sitting on them  because he can  transform  oh he's got like  he's trying to 
[01:42:30]  hide from us  and also  where is he  coming from  and where is he  going  there's nothing  it's desolate  Martian desert  for the entire  planet pretty much  he's coming from  work he's going  home  there's nothing  there  they live  underground  they're Mars  people  oh  you're of the  underground  society  they had to go  underground  because it's a  cataclysmic event  blah blah blah  blah  and why did he  come up  well he had to  come up for a  second to see  what's going on  that's part of  his job  Uncle Robert 
[01:43:00]  and this is an  official photo  from Robert  tell us about  the time you saw  the boogeyman  in Fallujah  again  the boogeyman  of Fallujah  it was a werewolf  Jeff  what do we know  about this picture  it's official  yeah it's a NASA  picture  from the rover  or whatever  the Mars rover  and the rocks  though there's so  many of these  oddly shaped rocks  in this area  that from the  right angle  you can make  anything out of  any of these  rocks  go ahead 
[01:43:30]  make something  then real quick  go  alright how about  this  make a brooch  did the rover  just  did the rover  take a few  did the rover  take a few more  pictures to see  if this thing  moved  I think so  no  no  of course  not  well you can't  do that  it takes a long  time for the  signal to get  to the rover  to tell it  to do something  so by that time  it could have  been gone  or it could have  already been  programmed to  move on  so you could have  missed it  they can't just  control it like 
[01:44:00]  with a joystick  like you're doing  a radio control  car or something  you know  well they live  underground  so this guy  the Martians  this guy  they like  stay down  stay down  but he really  wants to be  an actor  and he  actually came  up because  he saw  the cameras  to see  what  and he  went like  that  gave a little  wave  and then  he's back  down  and he  got chastised  they grabbed  him back  down  I've never  hated anyone  as much  as I hate  it's a dumb  picture but  everyone's talking  about it  and whatever  there you go  there's our  bit on the 
[01:44:30]  big foot on  Mars thing  there's no life  on Mars  just stop it  already  let's stop  looking  let's go  somewhere else  I love the  space program  I love what  they're doing  but can we  go somewhere  else  nothing's alive  on Mars  how do you  know there's  nothing alive  it's a dead  rock  what about a  little amoeba  or something  no not even  that  they've drilled  into rocks  they've taken  soil samples  they've tested  crap out  they've brought  crap back  they've done  everything they  can to see if  there's any  little living  thing  nothing  a little dust 
[01:45:00]  mite  no  dust mite  would be a  huge find  it would be  they haven't  even found  anything  so there's  a whole  planet  with nothing  like our  entire solar  system  there's one  planet  earth  that's it  that's it  nothing else  ever  in our  solar system  what do you  think  Jupiter's got  some kind  of thing  happening  do you know  I don't know  you look like  you should live  there  I knew  a planet  joke was  coming  I'm sorry  you have a 
[01:45:30]  tell  you start  looking at  my tits  in my  stomach  area  what planet  would Bob  be lighter  on  let's do  a little  science  today  what  lightest  lighter  probably  lighter  Venus  I believe  probably  Mercury  you'd end up  being very  light on Mercury  not much  mass there  really  Jupiter  you'd just  be a big  heavy  fat mess  you'd crush  you would  actually crush  you'd be  comet  shoemaker 
[01:46:00]  Levy  someone wants  to explain  the picture  let's go to  Pete in  Connecticut  Pete  hey  how's it  going  hey  I want  to just  kind of  clear up  a couple  things about  that image  of Bigfoot  that little  let's call it  Bigfoot for a  moment here  is about  three feet  away from  the rover  so I would  put that  at about  four inches  high  it's  Littlefoot  yeah  it's Littlefoot 
[01:46:30]  that really  is only  three feet  away  from the  camera  how do  you know  from the  camera  how do  you know  yeah  look up  the  Planetary  Society  that's  more than  three feet  pal  I've talked  to people  uh-huh  they're saying  at least  four  explain this  the  Mars rover  takes monochrome  pictures  yes it does  because they  programmed it  to do so  explanation  go  yeah  it's a  combination  of three  pictures 
[01:47:00]  with three  different  filters  taken over  the course  of a couple  of minutes  you have no  idea what you're  talking about  Jimmy knows a  little bit about  this stuff  I've studied  astronomy  it's a  Polaroid  and they put  it on a  rocket and  send it back  immediately  it's the most  economic way  to do it  the Polaroid  of an  asteroid  they  use the  things at  the bank  NASA  say it's  only a  two inch  piece of  rock  alright  enough  about  Bigfoot  on Mars  thank you  Pete  oh you're  welcome  god bless  Pete  my apologies  we're moving  on to this 
[01:47:30]  because we got  a Super Bowl  around the  corner now  and Bobby  brought this  to our  attention  an awful  Super Bowl  song from  what year  I think  it was  85  85  when the  Patriots  were playing  the Bears  I remember  this  of course  and what 
[01:48:00]  they  cheered  them  on  that's  right  oh  oh  then they  beat  those  Miami  pretenders  and the  jinx  was gone  still on the  down  and around  them  say can we  go that  far  just let  us stay  for the  record  there's no  stopping  this  right  and  stop 
[01:48:30]  New England  the Patriots  and me  whoa  oh no  ah  yeah  the Patriots  and me  that right there  for that song  right there  I don't care how  long ago it was  they should lose  the Super Bowl  they should just  forfeit  forfeit the Super Bowl  to pay back  for that embarrassment  that is that song  the Patriots  and me  like hey  you're involved  too people  you're involved  too  you're part of  this as well  it's New England  the Patriots  and me 
[01:49:00]  am I going to be  the quarterback  STP  STP  one of those  singers just get  like a residual  check  because you just  played it  sitting there  in his own feces  hey what's this  a million years  later  every time it gets  played someone  just walks up to  his door and  punches him in the  face  someone out there  is like great  thanks for the  reminder  you think that 
[01:49:30]  guy was like  rocking and  making faces  while he was  doing those  leads  some guitar  things  what year was  that  85  oh man  oh the Bears  came out with  their song  Super Bowl 
[01:50:00]  Shuffle  yeah that was  the biggest one  everyone remembers  that song  no one remembers  this one there  Bob  yeah they had to  come up with  this  that was my  parents wedding  song actually  Super Bowl  Shuffle  what style of music  what style of music 
[01:50:30]  would you guys  would you guys call  that  this isn't  satellite so I  can't say the  sh word I want  to say but  style of music  it's got jingle  to it a little  jingle  it's a little  company made it  like bad  bad pop  from like  70s almost  sounding 
[01:51:00]  bad  Brady Bunch  variety hour  I see  like a TV show  kind of pop  we're gonna have  the video of this  fine song on  onaradio.com  they should be  singing that at the  Babylon Club  and then just get  mowed down with  machine guns  like that fat  dancing thing  that stupid  little dancing  character with the  mask on  Bobo  what was his name  was it Bobo  or something like  that  I'm so glad he  got gunned down  you want  those inept  brothers  you want more 
[01:51:30]  you want more  you want more  yes  you want more  you guys should  make a new video  of people dancing  to that  it'd be great  just cutting people  like Boston  people dancing  Boston people  would be great 
[01:52:00]  that would really  be degrading  I like it  just get all new  people  the same song  or take police  brutality videos  from Boston  show some poor  girl getting her  eyes shot out  with a beanbag  gun after the  World Series  we got another  one  enough of that  a taste of  another song  what's the other  song Bobby  you know  I forget the  other one  I remember that  one  there is another  one though  because this  one didn't  really cut it  like they thought  this was going  to actually compete  against the shuffle  and it really 
[01:52:30]  it fell short  so they had to  come up with  another one  so we had  the Casey Kasem  of crap  you know all  these facts  Bobby you know  this stuff  what came out  first  the Super Bowl  shuffle  or the curly  shuffle  oh  good one  remember the  curly shuffle  the curly  shuffle  heymo  heymo  you don't  remember that  which one  was the parody  of which one  I don't know  actually  I think the  curly shuffle  curly shuffle  was first  I'm going to  say it was  successful  that's another 
[01:53:00]  douchey  look at Jim  this is fun  he claps his  hands  knowing it's  just  nothing  we're good  we didn't go  out drinking  last night  crazy that you  called that  that's crazy  you sing this  to mongoloids  heymo  heymo  because they  got the same  hair  and do the 
[01:53:30]  burden shuffle  we love  licking lead  paint  putting our  fingers in  sockets  embarrassing the  folks  doing the  down shuffle  heymo  heymo  imagine I go  to a record  well  peep peep  beat rose  go to a record  label in the  80s and you  pitch a song  about the  three stooges  yeah and they 
[01:54:00]  take it  and they think  it's a great  idea  then it's huge  our follow up  the b-side was a  little number about  my mother the car  anyone  remember that  speaking of car  maybe I dipped a  little too obscure  into 50s television  remember a show  called my mother the  car  no  it was a tv show  about this guy  and his mother  had died  and her spirit  went into this  old model t  and he would go  to work and go 
[01:54:30]  about his daily  business of you  know dating and  working and  everything yet he  got advice and  sometimes chastised  by a car in the  garage that was  indeed his mother  it was called my  mother the car  more useless  information in your  head because you're  trying to forget  about crap that  happened to you as a  kid that one I  pushed out when  the Mexican tried  to pick me up at  a party yeah the  Mexican man tried  to pick me up at  a party and wanted  me to go into the  bushes with him yeah  and then my father  overheard him say

[02:07:00]  that hair looks  like Tony Montana's  sister  he looks like  the lead singer  of Cinderella  he's nice  all those guys  from back in the day  this is like the 80s  he's older than  huh  he knows how to  treat a woman  by doing  taking her to the  toilet  to the toilet  to make out  Manolo  I like Fernando  Scarface  Manolo  shoot this piece  Manolo 
[02:07:30]  alright  moving on  like how the cop  just sits there  like  Tony what are you  gonna do  Mel  well let me tell  you something  Mel  Mel's just  sitting there  like  I gotta try  to talk him  out of shooting  me here  that bullet  in Mel's gut  looks like it  hurt  oh  alright  and he's even  willing to just  take  you know  we don't even  have to deal  with this  I'll get this  bullet taken  care of  Tony  I'll go my  separate way  we're good  no 
[02:08:00]  there's nothing  better when a  guy's making a  deal after he  just saw somebody  get shot  yeah  hey it's cool  and won my  ticket to the  resurrection  and I have  seen that movie  recently and  they did  remaster the  sound  which is good  the music still  blows because  it's that real  cheesy 80s  synth music  yeah the music  is really bad  but what was  also bad was  the gun sound  effects were  horrible  no matter what  gun they used  it was the  same old 
[02:08:30]  pew pew  sound  but they  redid the  bullet sounds  for different  machine guns  and stuff  it's got a lot  more bass sound  to it so they  sound more  realistic  can they fix  up the blood  yeah the blood  looked bad  it was kind of  a little too  bright  yeah  it was a low  budget movie  no it was a  big budget  movie  it's good  stuff  take it to  the limit  wait have you  seen it lately  yeah  limit push it  to the limit  yes  it feels  dated  it feels real  dated  why didn't I 
[02:09:00]  see the big  hole in the  clock where the  12 is  dummies are  sitting in that  counting room  there's a big  hole in the  12  hole o'clock  hole o'clock  we were only  supposed to be  here till  hole o'clock  wait a minute  this just  reminds me of  Grand Theft Auto  to have this  blasting as you're  just running over  prostitutes  it's wonderful  I don't mean the  game  I mean when you 
[02:09:30]  steal a car and  run over  prostitutes  what's worse  in a movie  is Injustice  for All  another Pacino  movie  whoever does  the music in  this movie  should be  executed  if it's the  same person  it's horrendous  was he this  Pacino  or then he  turned into  this guy  that was  Sea of Love  this guy  what happened  overnight he  woke up  what was the  transitional movie  Sea of Love  Sea of Love  is when the  change started  it was a  soft spoken  Pacino  kind of just  talked like  this  and then it 
[02:10:00]  turned into  this  what  what happened  it's not even  the same  not even close  to the same  guy  it's two  different guys  that's Luca  Brasi  if you showed  Bigfoot for Mars  those two films  the Bigfoot would  say it's two  different actors  wasn't it the  hooah  hooah  it was that  one  Sea of Love  yeah  are you sure  Sea of Love  was the one  where he  yes with  Michael Rooker  and the broad  Ellen Barkin  yeah  and the other  big line 
[02:10:30]  that turned  him over  was what  in the  third  Godfather  just what  I'm out  they bring  me back  in  oh yeah  he kind of  was yelling  in that  one  and he  yelled  in heat  too  the voice  changed  Sea of Love  though  and the hair  changed  too by the way  he did author  author  he did in  79  he did  Injustice  For All  he might have  done something  like cruising  I think in  1980  I actually  liked that  movie  me too  wow  are you kidding  me  what  I hear the  music  I look at  the clock  and go  what happened  clock  I swear 
[02:11:00]  today's show  flew by  flew  that means  we didn't  do anything  no  you know  that right  no  you know  that right  you know  that right  no  Bob Kelly  Stress Factory  tonight and  tomorrow  Jeffrey Ross  tonight and  tomorrow  at Caroline's  here in  New York  City  I think  I'm going  to go see  Jeffrey Ross  instead of  Bob Kelly  Opie I love  when you come  see me  you always  bring a date  I would too  you think  a train  to Jersey  have your  steak taken  away  stupid Vinny 
[02:11:30]  with that  table  sets me up  nice  and then  he oversells  the joint  he goes  would you  mind  taking your  nice food  and hanging  out in the  waitress area  thanks  thanks Vinny  he calls it  the owner's  table  yeah  jackass  he is a  jackass  it's a great  club though  I tell him to  his face  every time  I see him  I'm bringing  you up for a  bow if you  come to  Caroline  oh really  does that  put any  more  does that  get me to  get you  stress  factor  I haven't  seen you  in a while  and I'm  in town  this weekend 
[02:12:00]  so I think  I might see  Jeffrey Ross  and maybe I go  see Bobby  tomorrow night  I don't know  I'm going to  try to figure  this out  busy weekend  I'm going to  try to figure  this out  Bobby  come down  right near  Philly  you girls  from Philly  go see  the family  right near  Philly  New Brunswick  New Jersey  I was just  making  oh my god  by the way  best club  in Jersey  stress  factory  pretty much  the only club  at this point  right  yeah  Scarface  and then Pacino  did what we  called revolution  and Sea of Love  I'm never wrong  about movies  yeah there's  that transition 
[02:12:30]  because I would  love to get  the two movies  where you watch  the one  and he's the  old Pacino  you know  the younger Pacino  and then watch  the other one  and he's just  this yelling  gravelly voice guy  you do a great  impression  but I think  we really need  to get the  actual audio  my impression  is just  other people's  impressions  I'm not even  going to try  to say  I did an  impression  you're doing  Frank Caliendo  and everybody  else that does  the Pacino thing  also on Monday  we're going to  have more  very uncomfortable  audio from  Ant and I 
[02:13:00]  from way back  in the day  I can't wait  we just started  that bit  today  and it's going  to get real  real ugly  in the coming weeks  what's it from?  it started a new  thing called  old school  Opie and Anthony  and we played  some audio  from 1996  today  great  it was really  uncomfortable  so funny  it was just  a taste  I want to hear  that  well  come back  Monday  alright  alright  this is the  Opie and Anthony  show  Opie and Anthony  it's the Opie and  Anthony show  it's the Opie and Anthony 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Nice crowd outside, though.  Yeah, there is.  One of those Fridays when we get some people out there.  I know that, dude.  Sorry about my pal talk there last night.  Do you have a friskies, guys, or anything like that?  Oh, yeah.  There's a whole thing that goes on.  It's up there.  My paisan.  Ho, ho, ho.  There it is.  It's like a lagoon let out.  Just look.  Who's the only guinea out there?  Um, um, the redhead?  Um, the redhead?  Uh, no. 
[02:17:30]  What?  He's being blocked.  He was on pal talk last night.  What's up, bro?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know, pal.  That's, uh, H.  Cup Jane's husband.  Yeah.  See, I know.  You guys are a bigger draw than, uh, Bobby Kelly at stress factor.  Where's Bobby?  Where's Bobby Kelly?  Hey, I meant to ask Jeffrey Ross on the other side of the show.  He got into a bit of controversy.  No.  I guess there was some kind of roast for Mike and Mike on ESPN.  Yeah.  ESPN radio. 
[02:18:00]  They were promoting the hell out of this thing.  I remember reading about it.  And it finally went down.  What?  At the House of Blues, Atlantic City?  It was great.  It was great.  Sold out.  Yeah.  And then, what?  One of the ESPN anchors, some broad, went up there.  And she was shit-faced.  And have you heard about this yet?  No, but it's starting to sound sexy.  Yeah.  And she is now suspended.  And it's a whole thing, right?  What'd she do?  She pulled a Courtney Love, basically.  But worse.  Wow. 
[02:18:30]  Worse.  Well, what'd you hear?  Because, I don't know.  Here's what I'm afraid of.  It's like the best roast I ever did.  Yeah.  There's some, like, stolen footage of it on the net.  You know?  But they won't release.  They're pretending it didn't happen.  Oh, no.  It was supposed to be a huge promotion.  It was a huge promotion.  Yeah, they hyped it up huge.  It was sold out.  They filmed it.  I'm assuming they were going to put it on DVD or on the internet.  Something was going to happen.  And this anchor lady from ESPN fucked up so bad that, you know, when you do a big event  the next day on the radio or the next time you do a radio show, it's all about that event. 
[02:19:00]  Mike and Mike haven't said a word about it.  Like, it's a...  Something's going on.  It disappeared.  The whole thing disappeared like it never happened.  Why?  Was she throwing the N-word around?  Well, she was...  Hmm.  Look, he's even scared of talking about it.  Wow.  Because I want to see the footage so bad that I'm afraid that I feel like if I...  As long as you don't lie about it.  As long as you don't...  Well, I mean, a lot of people saw it.  So, you know, essentially she...  It was written up anyway.  This was all in the press.  But she was drinking out of a vodka bottle straight at the podium, just spewing vulgarities 
[02:19:30]  at Charlie Weiss, the head coach at Notre Dame.  Uh-huh.  You know, the big fat Charlie Weiss, who I called the lunchback of Notre Dame.  The lunchback.  And, you know, he'd already taken, like, some fair shots.  Yeah, no.  I said, Charlie, what happened?  You look like you put on all your freshman's 15.  He's a big guy.  Yeah.  But anyway, she...  How big is he?  She just sort of, like, screaming, cursing, doing, like, you know, all kinds of Jesus 
[02:20:00]  references, so the Catholic League, whatever.  Well, you're scared to say, but John in Virginia is saying that she shouted out,  fuck Jesus.  Yeah.  And Bill Donahue got involved?  Who's that?  Catholic League.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, he did.  He did get involved.  And actually, the roast was two weeks ago.  They didn't suspend her until yesterday.  So, obviously, this thing was percolating for a while.  It wasn't suspended for doing a roast.  Like, the roast is supposed to be no holds barred. 
[02:20:30]  Well, what bothers me, what bothers me, Opie, is that it's supposed to be a roast.  I mean, anything goes.  No holds barred.  Obviously, you have me and Eddie Griffin and people like that.  It's going to be out there.  And then they punish somebody for drinking too much, essentially.  And we're not being good at it.  Like, she's not used to doing that, right?  Of course.  There were great players there and stuff.  And Dick goes there.  Every roast has that one person that is not used to doing it.  And they say unbelievable things where you're like, wow. 
[02:21:00]  You don't know the nature of a roast now, do you?  It's like, I'm really afraid.  It's very afraid.  ESPN, it's like, you know, they're watching me at all times.  They're big.  Well, here's a picture of her, like, guzzling out of a vodka bottle.  Hey, look.  Dana Jacobson's having some fun.  So, here's a fun picture.  That's Dana Jacobson from ESPN having fun.  Yeah, this guy, Trey Wingo, me and him pulled her off the stage eventually.  And she kept going back.  It went on for 15 minutes. 
[02:21:30]  Was she really drunk?  Yeah, she was falling off her stool.  She had to be, like, carried out of there.  It was insane.  Why wouldn't they just make fun of it?  I did.  I tore her apart.  What follows me is that Mike and Mike can't talk about it.  And, you know, or aren't talking about it.  I guess I'm torn because I want to get my footage so bad because I've never killed that hard in a roast.  Wow, really?  A sports roast?  So, what are you hoping?  That they're going to release this someday?  Or at least give it to me just to have for my archives or whatever.  I guess she made fun of a Catholic school, Notre Dame, right? 
[02:22:00]  I didn't.  I mean, it was all her, really.  She made fun of football and she made fun of Jesus.  That's the triple play of hell.  But the focus should be on all the funny people.  Right.  Not only one person that couldn't hold her liquor.  Yeah, yeah.  The guys had a great night.  And she's not used to doing this.  And, you know, again, when people aren't used to roasting, they don't know what the limits are.  That's almost a good idea, though, for somebody that doesn't know how to do a roast.  Go up, completely intoxicated, and just, like, be drunk.  Have a moment.  Yeah, have a moment where people are like, oh, my God. 
[02:22:30]  Then it transcends, oh, are they funny?  Are they doing jokes about it?  Are they this?  Oh, they look a little stiff.  Or they look like they're scared up there.  Just make it like, oh, my God, that person is so fucking hammered.  They have no idea what they're doing.  Steve-O was doing that during the Gene Simmons roast.  It was kind of similar to that.  I guess that never works, because they always wind up dragging you out of there.  I know.  That strategy isn't a good one.  I don't know shit about roasts.  I've watched a few and been up there and, you know, just watching. 
[02:23:00]  It was crazy.  But what I want to ask you, is there a limit?  Is there limits when you do a roast?  That's a good question.  I feel that everybody who, when you leave the roast, everybody should have had a good time.  Like, if somebody leaves in a bad mood or pissed off or embarrassed, then that's not necessarily a good roast.  I think good roasts are extensions of good friendships.  And people, it should be a party.  But I don't really get it.  It should be chummy.  It shouldn't be a competition where somebody's, like, humiliated.  Well, the last roast. 
[02:23:30]  But the last roast.  The big Flava Flav roast, I feel like they were too hard on Carrot Top.  I feel like he didn't know what was coming.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  He couldn't take it.  At a certain point, it was piling on.  And I'm not into the piling on.  But shouldn't he know that it could get ugly?  Yeah, but so let it get ugly, and then he let off.  Well, the last roast we went to was the Pat Cooper roast.  It got pretty damn ugly.  But you're saying everyone walked away.  Everybody walked away from that in a good mood.  What's the, I don't get what the difference is.  It's a friar's roast where everybody's a good sport.  Right.  They're in the comedy business, for the most part, or they're friends of Pat Cooper. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  But this thing at ESPN is not.  So if someone says something horrific up there, and they're trying to be funny, like you as another comic,  you look at that person and go, wow, you went too far.  But in their mind, they were thinking, I was just going for a shocking laugh.  I think if you're out of control, people have that vibe.  Because there's been people that hit really hard, but you know where it's coming from.  I think when people are out of control, or it looks like it's coming from an ugly place,  that's when people have a problem.  That's what happened with this woman.  Yeah, but didn't Daniel, what's his name? 
[02:24:30]  Daniel cried.  He cried at his roast.  He got emotional.  He got really emotional.  He started reading the reviews from De La Ventura, his TV show.  Wait, wait.  He cried because he felt good about the reason that people were...  No, he cried because he was embarrassed at how bad his TV show was.  Are you kidding me?  No, it's classic.  Where is that footage?  He's probably drunk.  Oh, that footage exists.  I'm going to track that down from the prior.  He was so proud that he actually, because he fought to have it in New York City. 
[02:25:00]  Because they wanted to film it.  He was like, he wanted to do it here so actors could work in New York.  And it just got trashed.  Daniel is a crybaby?  You know what it is?  I didn't say that.  He lives in Hoboken.  I'm not saying that.  I don't care.  He's crying.  You know what that means, too, right?  Like a woman, like a grandma.  You can act like a man.  And then Jerry Lewis.  We roasted Jerry Lewis two years ago, and he had a heart attack on the flight home.  Oh, fuck.  I don't know.  I can only blame myself.  That was in Las Vegas, right?  Yeah.  He flew from here, did the roast here. 
[02:25:30]  The next morning, it's seven in the morning.  By the time I woke up the next day, I read, Jerry Lewis has heart attack on the way home  from Roast.  Oh, what did I say?  Gosh.  Was it a commercial plane or a private?  I don't know.  It was a commercial plane.  You probably laughed too hard.  And shaked something loose inside.  Shaked something loose.  There's a lot of time when it's essentially a retrospective of your career.  Ghosts from your past come up.  People are showing up in the audience.  And I think it affects people.  It's very stressful, maybe.  In a monumental way.  I mean, it's your whole life.  Flashing before your eyes.  In the backhanded compliments. 
[02:26:00]  And when you're old and, you know, mixed with the heart medication and whatever he has,  he's pumped.  It's just uncomfortable to be made fun of, no matter who you are.  I couldn't take it.  I couldn't take it.  I don't mind it at all, man.  I've been roasted.  And my friends are killing me.  I'm used to it at the cellar.  You have no skeletons.  You are an open book, but other people can't take it.  Yeah, you get out.  You'll say anything about yourself.  But I mean, even like just getting teased about bad performance or you stink.  And when it's coming from guys like these guys or Patrice or Voss, I know they love 
[02:26:30]  me.  I know they respect me as an artist.  I mean, it's corny, but it doesn't matter where it's coming from.  Yeah.  Like if it was coming from some guy that I knew really thought I sucked, who really  didn't like me, it wouldn't be fun.  And that was the problem with Carrot Top, though, is that you guys aren't friends.  I mean, when Norton's roast, it was all his friends and all people who cared about him.  So when people say that, you can take the hit.  But you guys on that roast, nobody was really buddy-buddy.  And Carrot Top was taking hits from people he probably knew didn't like him.  Carrot Top showed up there because, this is the Flava Flav roast, because Flava Flav invited 
[02:27:00]  him.  They're buddies.  We got that audio?  We do have that sound.  And for whatever reason, in my opinion, as a fan, I love Greg Giraldo.  I thought he went too far.  And it's fine.  You know what I mean?  It happens.  But in the end, I feel like it's not fun for the guys who are there.  And why do that?  Wow.  I don't get what a roast is, then.  It's a...  You know, I like to do it...  Yeah, it was...  No, I don't know how to describe it. 
[02:27:30]  But when you see it, you know it.  Like, the Carrot...  I'll give you an example.  If you want to break it down, if we're breaking it down, I'll break it down.  And I'm just using Greg Giraldo as an example, because everybody knows him, and he's an awesome  roaster and an awesome comedian.  But like, he delved into commentary a couple times.  And it's not necessarily...  If I want to say something about somebody, I try to do an innuendo, or make a joke out  of it.  Yeah.  But he said, Carrot Top, when he went to the Plastics, what the fuck happened to your face? 
[02:28:00]  That was the line.  That made me laugh really hard.  I know!  It's hilarious!  See, that's why I don't get it, because that made me laugh really hard.  But it's not a joke, it's a fact, it's a question, it's not even rhetorical.  Oh, shit!  And the guy, Carrot Top, thinks, knows, in his world, he looks great!  He's got guys around him all the time, saying, you look great!  You look great!  Yeah, men.  Yeah.  And then he just, that's funny, because it wasn't a joke, it's just kind of like, what  the fuck happened to you?  I'm sitting between, you know, Carrot Top's sitting between me and Jimmy Kimmel, and we 
[02:28:30]  both, both our heads turn, and we look at Carrot Top, and it was like, the smile just  melted off his face.  He's got to think they're going to make fun of his stupid muscles, and his eyeliner, and  his plastic surgery.  Right.  He's got to think there's going to be jokes coming about that stuff.  You're a comic, you just, you got plastic surgery, and you were an eyeliner, and you're  around a bunch of comics, you're not going to take a hit for that?  And he's not the type of comic that addresses that stuff.  He's silly.  I like him because he's self-deprecating.  I do like that.  But in his act, he's very silly with props. 
[02:29:00]  Whereas Joan Rivers did the most caustic stand-ups that I've probably ever seen recently.  I worship her.  She's great.  She's a fucking brilliant comic, but she hits herself hard, so she's used to it.  This is what Jeffrey Ross was referring to.  God, you are a big, ghoulish woman.  I'm talking to you, Carrot Top.  Yeah.  Jesus.  What happened to your face? 
[02:29:30]  You look retarded.  How did you do that?  How did you find a plastic surgeon who could add a chromosome?  That is good, man.  That's funny.  He inflamed pretty hard, too.  That's funny.  But nobody really...  He doesn't know Carrot Top.  They're not friends.  Right.  Even the old roast, it would be a performance.  Someone would get up there, and me and you would go at it.  You'd take the hit if I was on... 
[02:30:00]  You'd be the straight man if I was actually getting the laughs.  Right.  You knew when to kind of let it go and let them get...  What's the history of a roast?  Carrot Top should have been laughing.  He should have been laughing.  Even if he was upset, he should have been laughing.  And that would have made it all right.  And I coached him, and he still didn't listen to me.  What's the history of a roast?  It used to be where your friends got together and roasted you?  It had a more like...  But now it seems like they just try to get big names, and that could be where the problem is.  It used to be like a Rat Pack-y, chummy thing.  Sure, sure.  A best friend would roast a best friend, and you'd have sort of like the pals around. 
[02:30:30]  But it's evolved into something more popular.  It's not so much like a career retrospective as much as like a man of the year.  Somebody's hot.  Comedy Central, to their credit, popularized it by doing that.  And it's fun because now everybody knows what a roast is.  When I first started doing them, people looked at me like, what are you talking about?  Kenny Rogers, Roasters?  They had no clue.  And now it's like something that is like the World Series of comedy.  It's the only time in comedy where it's a bunch of headliners on one stage as opposed 
[02:31:00]  to an opener in the middle.  It's very individual.  You're going out to get your laughs.  Right.  And you're going out to kill like it's a set.  Right.  Instead of doing like back in the day when it was everybody kind of working.  You know, I'd say something about you, and you'd go, that's good.  What?  You'd work together.  It was more of a performance back in the day.  Sure.  With Dean Martin.  I just don't like his fucking play acting.  But yeah, it's good.  It's a little more, it's like, it's a roast.  I get shit from the old school sometimes that it's sort of a, because I produced a lot 
[02:31:30]  of the early ones, that it's evolved into like something like almost like roller derby  with Courtney Love charging the podium.  I still don't get it because I thought that Greg Strauss shit was hilarious.  It's hilarious.  You started him at the Boston and you used to host him.  He gets hurt over that.  Back in the day, you hosted, I remember Louie went up and trashed you and you took the hit.  It was hilarious.  It was great.  I was honored because a friend takes the time to write jokes about you.  You're happy.  It was hilarious.  You took the hit.  You didn't take it personal.  That's how Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Kimmel fell in love. 
[02:32:00]  She made fun of him at the Hugh Hefner roast and he couldn't believe a hot chick knew who  he was.  And then, you know, it's like a comedy pat on the back when you take the time to write  a barb.  There's nothing funny when a comic bombs at a roast.  Yeah.  How about Keith Robinson?  Keith Robinson.  Oh, my God.  That was so bad.  Yeah.  He had a meltdown.  Whose roast was it?  Yours, Jimmy?  No, that was Patrice O'Neal's roast.  Patrice O'Neal's roast.  It happens.  It happens.  It was wonderful.  They actually tried to get him off the stage and he got angry. 
[02:32:30]  Didn't he run in at the last minute, too?  With a napkin.  Yeah.  With, like, two things written on it.  He thought he could improv the roast.  Yeah, he was going to improv.  Because he did before.  The one before that, he just went up and killed with not even writing anything down like he  has for his whole career.  And this one, he came in with a napkin and he took a hot one because Ben Bailey, out  of nowhere, just annihilated.  Yeah.  Annihilated.  Ben was great that night.  I remember that, yeah.  It's also interesting, like what he's saying, like, Ben Bailey makes a huge impression on 
[02:33:00]  his friends and suddenly you're empowered by that.  It's a time to step up, which is also another thing I love about the roast.  Like, I used to go to the Friars Club when I was, you know, younger and Alan King, rest  his soul.  He'd always be there.  He'd always give me shit.  You're not dressed right.  And then one day, he'd already known me for years, never gave me the time of day.  And then one day, I just saw it in his eyes while I was at the podium.  I've won this legend's respect.  So that he can feel those moments.  Like, he'll never forget seeing his buddy, like, step up at a roast.  Bobby, like you're talking about. 
[02:33:30]  I've never felt that feeling of my friends actually.  Well, we don't hate you anymore.  That's consolation.  Here's what a roast is.  The beauty of a roast.  It's all comedians, or usually comedians.  And comics can't do the shit they can get away with with an audience with each other.  Other comedians will kill you for it.  That shit that wins an audience over, it's like you have to be funny for real.  Like, you're fucking talking to guys that know.  And that smile and nod shit you do to win over a fucking couple from the Midwest isn't going to work. 
[02:34:00]  At least, I don't think it would make me laugh.  Comics who are brutal and wrote really good shit makes me laugh at a roast.  Oh, there's nothing worse.  The early roast at the Boston.  They were the best.  Yeah, they were just...  Oh, boss.  Roast to Barry Katz.  Barry Katz.  2000.  Oh, it was just mean.  And even the audience didn't know what to expect back then.  Like, he said, now they kind of know what they're about.  But back then, they were like...  You'd see the audience, like, look at each other.  Like, do they like each other? 
[02:34:30]  Are they going to fight?  It was weird.  Like, I used to go try to try out roast jokes at comedy clubs before the roasts, and I'd have to explain what it was.  Now, if I go on stage at a regular comedy club and go,  I'm roasting William Shatner on Tuesday.  I want to run...  Come up here, sir.  Play William Shatner.  They know exactly what it is.  It's become just a genre of comedy that everybody knows.  It's like a dead language that became new again.  It's fun.  Is it okay, though, to like...  Because there's a lot of reused stuff in roasts, which is kind of all right for some reason. 
[02:35:00]  Sure is.  Like the...  And not the exact word-for-word joke, but the angle, you can kind of hear over and over again a little bit.  Yeah, you can kind of use some of the same barbs on other people.  And another interesting thing is, like, even with this ESPN roast,  where it was just a couple comedians mixed with athletes and commentators,  it's fun to see what the non-pros are going to do.  Yep.  And it adds some life.  Like, they have an up-and-down thing, and I think it's fun when people bomb.  I think it gives the next guy something to work off of.  Oh, hell yeah.  Was that the one Billy Bird did? 
[02:35:30]  No.  Oh.  This was a recent one.  All right.  So just to wrap up, she's suspended, and Mike and Mike aren't talking about it.  So this is becoming a thing now.  Yeah.  Well, people are all over the blogs and stuff desperately trying to find footage of it.  And somebody put up a few minutes of my opening.  It's the hardest I ever killed at a roast.  I get one laugh that's like a full minute long.  It's like gladiators in a coliseum.  Sports fans, you know, it's crazy.  What was the line that got to react?  Oh, she had to fuck it up.  Oh, Mike Ditka was sitting next to me, and I just walked out. 
[02:36:00]  And the podium mic was like flaccid.  It kept falling down, up and down, and I kept slapping it.  And, you know, he does those commercials.  I go, oh, look at this thing.  It's like, it's lamer than Ditka's dick.  Just improv.  And I go, Mike Ditka, you look great for an 89.  I go, this roast was on his bucket list.  Just rough it, you know.  It was just a lot of sports jokes, and a lot of players were there who had just gotten  bounced out of the running. 
[02:36:30]  So I said, this isn't a who's who.  This is a who didn't make the playoffs.  And when you're just a player, a legend, they're sitting on these big chairs in front of all  their fans.  It's just that much bigger a target falling.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just awesome.  People love that.  It's hard to write roast jokes, though.  It takes me a long time.  It's hard.  To get them really sharp.  It's hard for me.  Yeah.  But yeah, it's just awful.  Well, you probably just pontificate at home.  Dude, roast.  It used to be fun.  Dude.  Hey, good one. 
[02:37:00]  Shut up.  Dude.  Fuck off.  You know who Mike and Mike do what they look like?  I said, I don't know who to make fun of first.  The boring, ugly one or the ugly, boring one.  That's funny.  That's funny.  I never roasted two guys at once.  So every roast has a different challenge.  Here we can write double jokes.  Some stuff, you know?  It was really fun.  It's a shame it'll never be seen.  Yeah.  We might be without her.  You never know.  Some drunk.  Yeah, maybe it'll blow over.  Maybe something will leak out.  I hope so.  It was so much fun.  These roasts are fun, you know? 
[02:37:30]  I bet you something leaks out.  Did we ever talk about the Gene Simmons roast?  Norton?  Save the Day?  That was fun.  From Steve-O?  Upstaging him?  I didn't know he was behind me, pissing into a bottle.  I didn't know it.  Wait, you were doing your shit when that went on?  All that fucking self-centered cunt.  They really killed me.  Just no respect for another performer.  Yuck.  We've blown him off.  He's off the team.  He's been trying to get on our show.  We're like, fuck.  We get it.  You're nutty.  Wait, so you're up there doing your thing and he gets naked and he's peeing behind you?  Well, he's peeing into a bottle.  He's probably in a blackout.  I didn't know he was doing it.  Did your dick get hard? 
[02:38:00]  I didn't know he was doing it or it would have.  Steve-O shows up at two in the afternoon for a nine o'clock roast for rehearsal.  I'm emceeing.  Norton comes by for, so he knows, for rehearsal.  Everybody leaves.  Everybody leaves.  I can't leave because I'm hosting.  I got stuff to do.  Everyone's, but Steve-O stays and he's just smoking weed and drinking for seven hours.  And I kept saying, Steve-O, you know, pace yourself.  That's what he does.  We've got a big show tonight.  He's dying to do the roast.  He asked me to put a good word in because he wanted to be a roaster.  He wants to be a comedian. 
[02:38:30]  He's kind of funny sometimes.  And he starts getting wasted all afternoon trying out jokes on me and the crew about wanting  to rape Gene Simmons' daughter.  Oh, shit.  And I'm like, Steve-O, it's funny, but I don't know, man.  I don't know, yeah.  You're not really, you know, you're kind of new at this.  Maybe you want to ingratiate yourself with the audience before you're talking about raping  this teenager.  Oh, man, he's got to love it.  You know, his teeth are like chattering, falling out of his skull.  Yeah, yeah, he's got to love it.  Ross, I got to kill.  I got to kill. 
[02:39:00]  Just take it slow, man.  You're getting away, you know.  I love how you're being diplomatic.  Like, ah, maybe you should soften the audience a little bit.  Well, because you want a little bit of, you know, you want a little danger around a roast.  But in your mind, you're like going, holy shit, this guy is out of his fucking mind.  Because I can't wait to see the look on Shannon Tweed's face when Steve-O starts talking about  raising his daughter.  Right, right.  I know.  But, you know, you also want to protect Gene Simmons and make sure he has a good time.  So, I go on.  Steve-O's already kind of like being crazy, whipping his dick out behind me and stuff. 
[02:39:30]  And Ralphie May went on.  It was fine.  You know, he was sort of upstaging Ralphie a little bit.  I was on first.  I was on first.  He went on first.  And Norton was not having it.  What did you say?  I didn't know what he was doing.  I had no idea what he was doing.  I was just, I did my shit.  It was fun, man.  If I didn't know what he was doing, I would have fucking screamed at him.  Oh, you didn't say anything to him?  That's selfish jizz bag.  No, I would have fucking, certainly, taking your dick out while I was so much performing.  Fucking idiot.  He peed into a bottle.  He's sitting between Paul Mooney and Paul Rodriguez, peeing into a bottle, on stage, 
[02:40:00]  with the audience loaded in, and the lights on, in the middle of the show.  It's crazy.  Holy shit.  So, just as I'm about to introduce him, they stop tape, and they drag him out.  Doesn't he get dragged out of everything?  Pretty much.  Well, then I heard a story just about a week later.  He was in Vegas at the, like, video game awards or some shit like that.  Yeah.  And the same producers as the Gene Simmons roast.  So, they thought it'd be funny to team him up with Ralphie May, who he pissed off at 
[02:40:30]  the roast.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Ralphie could go and make fun of him and stuff.  Yeah.  So, the show is that night.  Ralphie told me the story.  Steve-O's in the casino.  Two teenage girls come up.  Steve-O!  We want a picture!  We want a picture!  All right!  Okay!  You know?  And he's like, he's like, come on, girl!  He's groping them, holding his balls.  Right?  And he starts, like, like, feeling them up and, like, dancing and doing all kinds of stuff  with them.  And, uh, starts doing the same thing.  Whipping out his testicles and stuff in a casino in a Vegas.  Holy shit. 
[02:41:00]  Within 15 seconds, Ralphie said, security literally picked him up like he was a toddler  with his legs flapping.  They walked him to the front door, off casino property, to the sidewalk, emptied his pockets,  all kinds of stuff, poured water all over his drugs, put him in a car, they drove him,  didn't even get to go to his room.  They sent his assistant to his room to, like, you know, get his stuff.  They walked him through airport security, not just kicked out of the hotel. 
[02:41:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  Out of Vegas.  Like the old days.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's crazy.  I had that hat.  I was in Laughland, and a girl was a hot chick.  She was, like, 19.  Hot.  One of the hottest chicks I've ever seen.  She actually took our, she was at the bar dancing, and she took her boobs out to show  me.  And she was like, I was like, show me your, uh, show me your ass.  She was going to pull up, she had no panties, she was going to pull up her skirt and show  me her ass.  She goes, show me your, uh, show me your cock. 
[02:42:00]  I was two seconds away just whipping my little tiny cock out.  I shouldn't use the word whipping.  Flicking.  Taking out carefully my penis.  But, uh, I go, I will, just show me your ass.  So she picks up her skirt, shows me her, fuck, oh, I'll never forget this ass.  Security comes out of nowhere.  Grabs her, and just, you're out.  She's like, but my friend's upstairs sick.  We'll get her.  They went upstairs, took her sick friend, who had, like, the flu.  And you get the fuck out, too. 
[02:42:30]  And they threw them both out.  And she's like, but, but.  He goes, if you don't leave right now, you're going, I'm calling Metro, they're going to  come here and take you in jail for the weekend.  And they just took her and threw her the hell out.  Why didn't you take her somewhere and get a room?  Because my girlfriend was in my room?  Jackass.  I'm an idiot?  All right, we're going to take a break and get into some other things after, uh.  Can you plug my gig tonight?  Yeah.  Caroline, Jeffrey Ross, yes, of course.  Yeah.  And, uh, Bob Kelly doing something, I don't know. 
[02:43:00]  I'm at, uh, come on, don't fucking downplay my, uh, Stress Factory.  That's right, it's a big night.  Stress Factory 7, what is it?  You already said you don't need tickets for tonight.  I need tickets for tonight, Opie.  Listen, cutie pie.  Listen, there's nothing better for us than a sellout.  You always got to push, push.  Bob is that.  Even sick with that in my mouth.  This is a roast.  Stress Factory, Bob Kelly.  Eat your way out of that apple, you worm.  Jeffrey Ross, Caroline's, more Opie and Anthony with Jim Norton.  Next.  This is not what I'm used to. 
[02:43:30]  Here it is, live.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson, uh-uh.  Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy malarkey.  Tiny cooley.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good natured joshing around.  Puppy cock. 
[02:44:00]  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  Humana, humana, humana.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple.  Oh!  Ah!  But boy, they sure did.  Logan and Anthony!  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  You guys having fun out there? 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Got a nice crowd on the bleachers today.  We got Jeffrey Ross, who's about to pass out.  He thought he was drinking all night and then came in anyway and hung out with us today,  which we greatly appreciate.  Dave Attell's birthday.  Happy birthday, Dave.  Happy birthday to Dave Attell.  You shouldn't see your next one, Dave.  Oh.  Fuck.  Ross is going to sleep the day away, and then he's going to be at Caroline's tonight.  Appreciate that.  Yes.  Okay.  And Jimmy and I were discussing Bobby Fisher because he passed recently.  Yes.  And I was telling Jimmy I read a bunch of editorials on this nut bag the last week or so. 
[02:45:00]  But what a fascinating individual this guy is or was.  Yeah.  He was a fucking...  I was really depressed when he died.  Why?  When I was a kid.  Jimmy loves chess.  Really depressed.  Because I got taught chess.  And then I remember my cousin George giving me Fisher versus Spassky.  The way he taught me about Fisher, the guy was a fucking rock star who played chess.  I mean, he really was an amazing guy.  And he just lost his mind.  You know, a lot of geniuses do.  A lot of guys that are that smart just lose it at the end. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I'm going through that right now, man.  Yeah, exactly.  It just sucks.  But MVP is here.  Oh, I forgot we had another guest today.  Shit.  What's MVP?  Well, we're going to find out.  I don't know.  He's right out there hearing this, too.  Great.  No, we're very excited to talk to MVP from...  The big guy that looks like he's going to smash it.  Yeah, I got it.  Right there.  Turn around.  He's in the door.  He's going to kick your ass, Jimmy.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:46:00]  It looks like Master Poe and Gavin put together.  I didn't trash him.  He's a big guy.  Anyway, Bobby Fisher.  So, yeah, he lost his mind.  And then he denounced the United States of America.  Oh, yeah.  He called on...  He...  Well, it's good.  You know better than I am.  On 9-11, he called a radio show saying how great it was, the attacks.  Yeah.  And how the fucking U.S. deserves every fucking thing you can.  He was a crazy dude.  But he was Jewish.  He hated Jews.  They should arrest Jewish ringleaders.  And it turns out both of his parents were Jewish.  He was a nutty boy. 
[02:46:30]  Self-hating.  And then how did he get out of...  They shapeshift.  Why did he go to jail in where?  Japan for eight months, was it?  He left the country years ago.  He hated the U.S.  And in 92, he was playing in Yugoslavia, a rematch with Spassky for $3 million.  And the U.S. said, do not play this match.  There's an embargo against Yugoslavia.  So he read this thing the State Department sent him on the news.  It was at a press conference.  And he spit on it.  He spit on it at the news conference.  And he played the match.  And Japan tried to arrest him and send him back to the U.S.  But Iceland took him.  Eight months later. 
[02:47:00]  Really?  And then he just died there, yeah.  But he was in jail for eight months because of that?  Oh, he was hot under the collar.  Yeah.  Wow.  He was not a happy boy.  And then he had, like, a Unabomber beard when he died, right?  Yeah, he was truly not a fan.  He was just completely out of sight.  Like our own fan.  And we're looking for some audio because I guess it's all over YouTube.  Oh, when he has the beard, anything where Fischer has a beard, he's fucking a loon.  The young Bobby was just beautiful, but the older Bobby was a fucking loon.  It's interesting because wasn't his main nemesis the guy from Russia?  Boris Spassky, yeah.  Spassky?  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  What about Kasparov?  He's a big politician.  Some of these guys use their brains for good.  For evil.  Kasparov took his father's name.  For evil.  He took his father's name.  His real estate name is Weinstein.  So Fischer would never call him Kasparov.  He would always refer to him as Weinstein the Jew.  Oh, shit.  That's how Fischer referred to Kasparov.  That's just some chess shit talk.  Why haven't we played Bobby Fischer audio on this show yet?  Dude, I could fucking...  We'll try to get on today, if not Monday.  You go under the assumption that you know he had lost his mind.  You know that that happened. 
[02:48:00]  And the radio guys, they just let him go.  You can just hear him laughing.  Really?  It's like if he called in here, you'd just say what you do.  You gotta let someone like that go.  It's more interesting that way.  Oh, he's out of his mind.  All right.  We should get MVP in here.  Hope he's not mad at me.  MVP.  From the WWE.  I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind, because of that breakfast this morning.  Yeah, you go ahead.  You give him a piece of his mind.  Actually, he can do whatever the fuck he wants.  Holy crap.  Oh, look at this. 
[02:48:30]  Sir.  The belt.  How you doing, man?  Jesus Christ.  What are you doing, man?  No, I'm doing pretty good.  MVP.  You and these people hold my mics for me.  Yeah, really.  What are you doing, Iraq?  Show some respect.  Yeah, for MVP.  For the WWE.  And I see you brought your...  United States champion.  Okay?  Oh.  I got some credentials, you know.  You got a belt.  It's not a belt.  It's a title.  It's a title.  Our own Sam has a...  Well, he has a belt, then. 
[02:49:00]  I see the difference now between a title and a belt.  Okay.  Anyone can have a belt.  Yeah, lots of people have belts, but how many people have titles?  You have the title.  Now, whose ass did you stomp for that one?  I'm not allowed to say his name.  Oh.  Can you write it down?  You're not allowed to say his name.  The late Chris Benoit.  I had a long-running feud with him, and I beat him for the United States title, so...  Damn.  He kind of doesn't exist anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Way to take the fun out of the room.  Jesus.  Kind of hurts something in the new...  I thought you were going to say, yeah, who'd you beat for that? 
[02:49:30]  Well, and then I'm going to kick his ass again, and...  Gorilla Monsoon.  Anybody but Gorilla Monsoon.  What the fuck year are you living in?  I didn't eat turnbuckles anymore.  I didn't know Gorilla had died, so we had Vince on the show.  I have a knack for doing this.  I'm like, so how's Gorilla Monsoon?  It was just silence.  He's like, oh, he passed away.  Like, oh, no more talk.  Passed away, you idiot.  Yeah, way to throw a wet blanket on the situation.  I did it to Gene Simmons, too.  I have no idea I asked the wrong question.  Who's that guy?  Yeah, who's your...  Do you really need him?  No, that's my right-hand man. 
[02:50:00]  That's Joey V.  Joey V.  What does Joey V do?  He's from the BX.  He's Joey V.  And from the BX, just like you said, straight-up balling.  He needs somebody to go.  So he's your club sort of candy.  I'm a PR guy.  Yeah, I'm sort of candy.  Did you ever fight Apollo Creed?  You sound like Rocky.  Well, he is a boxer.  Yeah?  So he's good to have...  See, if I hit somebody, I get sued.  Right.  If he hits somebody, he doesn't really have much money, so no one's going to get much  out of him.  Did you play in the matching outfits? 
[02:50:30]  You know, he wants to be like me.  You know what I'm saying?  Like we said, I'm his right-hand man.  I thought you were a doorman at the Waldorf.  Jeffrey's going to get his ass handed to him.  Comedian.  You know you're in trouble.  One minute into the interview, you have to go, I'm a comedian.  Don't shatter my jawbone.  I made The Rock leave here once, remember?  Yeah, you did.  I remember that, too.  You made him leave.  Oh, yeah, you did.  What did you say to him to make him leave?  Oh, boy.  I was just messing around. 
[02:51:00]  Actually, it wasn't me.  I was here.  I was the only guy who actually made him leave.  I thought you said you made The Rock leave.  He did.  He said he made The Rock leave.  He did.  He did say that.  I thought I heard that, too.  I instigated you guys to make fun of him, and at the end of it, I was the only guy he  said goodbye to.  Remember that?  No.  You pissed him off when he left?  No, he was angry at some message board guy we had on there.  Yeah, you were making jokes about his place of birth.  We weren't.  It was the message board guy. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Trying to get us in trouble with The Rock.  We have a great relationship with him now.  Yeah, he calls every time he's putting out another shitty movie.  Hey!  Let's leave it at that there, Jeffrey Ross.  Easy.  We're friends.  You know, we promote his shitty movies.  MVP, what does that stand for?  Did I say that already?  Yeah, I did.  Okay.  It stands for Montel Vontavious Porter.  What the hell?  Wow.  A very ethnic name.  There was a reason for that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When I came up with the whole concept of MVP, I figured I needed to come up with a name  that when you heard the name, you knew it was a black guy. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  So if you know a white guy named Vontavious, introduce me to him, all right?  No.  Wait, you're black?  Sounds like a gladiator.  Okay, I'm half black.  All right.  Let's make sure we're the MVP white guys anyways.  Well, his hair's nappier than mine.  Is that the hair of a white man?  Oh, man.  No, no.  We know it.  He will not admit that he's got a little black blood in him, MVP.  Oh, it's in there.  You can tell.  It's in there, right?  He said he traced his family tree back and it went back to Thomas Jefferson, and we know  what was going on with Thomas Jefferson.  We all know what was going on there. 
[02:52:30]  So it's something.  You don't get hair like that.  No.  If you're all white.  Or big eyebrows.  I mean, if we're going to get into this.  Now, they're a little bushy.  He looks like Thomas C. Howell when he was trying to pretend to be a black guy.  Or C. Thomas Howell.  Thomas Howell.  Whatever his name is.  Thomas C. Howell.  So, Sam, now you know everything about WWE.  I do.  Would you like to conduct maybe a little interview?  Well, I think Sam should get the proper introduction.  This is Sam from the Sam and Sam show. 
[02:53:00]  What?  Yeah.  He's a celebrity.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a celebrity.  I might.  I might.  Jim, I would like to say that your hour on HBO was fantastic.  Thank you.  Monstering.  Who is this guy?  Thank you.  Whoever he is, I like him.  And congratulations on your half hour on Comedy Central.  Thanks, dude.  So.  What about me?  Please have something nice to say about me.  It'll make my day.  I'm glad you haven't smashed or broken anything like that.  Wow.  This guy knows.  He does now.  Yeah, I do. 
[02:53:30]  You see why I keep him around?  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  I'm sorry.  No, Bob.  He was on a roll.  I was on a roll for a quick second.  And Jeff.  That's right.  Jeffrey Ross.  Funny on the roast.  I've seen you on the roast.  Hysterical.  Anthony.  Thank you, sir.  Unbelievable gun collection.  Yes.  Oh, see?  We just bought an FS 2000.  Don't forget to shake him down in the range.  I don't know what that is, but congratulations.  It's a blast.  You can probably shoot.  What are the odds?  Shoot anything.  I don't care.  Shoot anything. 
[02:54:00]  Okay, now back to MVP.  You see how quickly he deflected that?  See how he just switched that off?  He's awesome.  He runs out of steam and then he just throws it back to you.  Sounds punch drunk.  You all right?  MVP really beat the hell out of somebody, man.  He's not joking.  I can take care of myself.  Where are you from originally?  Miami.  So were you like a fighter growing up?  A boxer?  Or what got you into wrestling?  You decided to be a big dude.  No, I was a fighter because I was half black, half white.  Grew up in a black neighborhood and went to a white school.  So the white kids called me nigger.  The black kids called me cracker.  So I had to fight all the time. 
[02:54:30]  So it's funny.  People say things like, oh, yeah, wrestling shit's fake.  I can fight for real, though.  So whatever you want to get into.  How do you feel about guys like men like myself and Chuck Liddell?  Like guys that do like.  We have Liddell coming in Monday.  Monday.  And we love those.  Is there any group of animals more like a problem than the MMA guys?  No.  You know what?  It's funny.  Most of the guys in the WWE are huge MMA fans. 
[02:55:00]  And a lot of the MMA guys are WWE fans.  So there's no issue there at all.  How do you feel about Brock actually going into the UFC?  Good luck.  You think he's going to dominate?  I want to see what happens when he gets punched.  Well, they say that he was an animal in the WWE.  He was a real psychopath anyways.  And he was a wrestler.  I didn't know him.  I've never met him.  I know a lot of guys.  I mean, as a wrestler, he's a phenomenal wrestler from what I've heard.  His amateur background speaks for itself.  But like I said, when you're in the MMA, if you've got a ground game, that's cool. 
[02:55:30]  But when someone punches you in the face repeatedly or catches you with an elbow in the chin,  I don't care how good you wrestle.  If you can't take a punch, all that's out the window.  That is what it's funny you said that because there was an interview with Steve Austin.  I think it was Austin who's a pretty bad dude.  Six million dollar man, yeah.  Oh, wait.  Stone Cold.  I'm fucking with you, Jimmy.  And he said, Lindsay Wagner's a dyke.  How do you feel about that?  I don't care.  She was a fake pussy.  So I think it was Stone Cold Steve Austin was being radio interviewed. 
[02:56:00]  And whenever they're talking about Liddell, he thinks he could fight Liddell.  And Liddell's response was like when he heard the audio, it was just like, he's never  been hit.  Like, I'll hit him.  It was like he's never been punched.  That's true.  Like, I'll punch him.  I don't know why I just repeated what you said.  Liddell's an animal.  Like, we both think alike.  Hey, MVP.  You were in jail, right?  Prison, yeah.  Did you talk about that?  Yeah, of course.  No shame.  You were in prison.  Prison.  I did nine and a half years.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay.  So it wasn't talking violations. 
[02:56:30]  Did you just get out because you looked like a young guy?  I went in when I was 16.  I got out when I was 26.  Oh, wow.  Were you arrested by the fashion police?  Whoa.  Oh, I'm going to leave now.  Oh, man.  I'll hold your coat.  Oh, boy.  I just, I want to.  Oh, boy.  He's taking his coat off, Jeffrey.  Jeffrey's really hungover, too.  Jeff's a little drunk.  Oh, boy.  No, I mean, I just.  I take it back.  You look fantastic.  Tell me what's wrong with my fashion. 
[02:57:00]  Tell me what's wrong.  You look great, man.  I'm kidding around.  I mean, point some out.  Is it the Gucci?  Is it the Versace?  I mean, what is it?  Please tell me.  Is it obviously well-dressed?  Please tell me.  Yeah.  Jeffrey, he's waiting.  Go ahead.  Tell him.  I'm afraid of him now.  I got my laugh.  Afraid of him now?  He's a great MVP.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I mean, I question your intelligence.  We're talking about my nine and a half years in prison.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to insult me?  That's a fashion police joke.  Just a little.  I haven't even gotten into why.  There are fascinably dressed individuals on television anywhere in the world.  Certainly in this room. 
[02:57:30]  Absolutely.  Look at us.  Look at you, Jeffrey.  Jesus.  You know what?  What?  Too easy.  Remember, like you, I get paid for a living to talk.  Right.  The only difference is I speak to a much, much larger audience.  That's true.  So, not reflecting on Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Can you not hit me because you're mad at him?  Yeah.  I feel like you're getting very close to me.  I think this suit is good.  Well, no, he keeps moving back.  All right.  Get the mic, too.  Get the fuck over there.  Stay over there.  Steve's scared of you, too.  I think everyone in this room is scared of you. 
[02:58:00]  I'm not scared of him.  He's a nice guy.  The guy did nine and a half years in prison.  Shut up.  You are scared of him.  You are.  I'm not scared of him.  He's a nice guy.  If he wasn't a nice guy, you'd be scared of him.  I think Bobby...  I'm trying to be the one guy who isn't.  No, I'll tell you what's going on with Bob.  I think he's in love.  With who?  You're giving him a nice look there.  What are you talking about?  Don't set me up for a pounding, you asshole.  I'm not scared of him.  He's a nice guy.  No one's scared of a nice guy when he's being nice.  I made a joke, and now I'm actually pretty afraid. 
[02:58:30]  Are you really afraid?  Yeah, you should be.  Because there's a thing that protects us, which is the fact that it's entertainment.  But yet, there's the part of your brain that understands that there's a man that's 10 years  in prison who has punched a lot of people in the face.  It's nine, but who's counting after one?  I've had my ass kicked more times than most people have had fights.  So I learned how to fight by getting my ass kicked.  How long in prison were you before you had the first really nasty, nasty confrontation?  I remember when I went in, I was 16. 
[02:59:00]  Why did you go to jail?  Because I don't know.  Arm robbery, arm kidnapping.  You kidnapped?  Well, let me explain how that works.  In the state of Florida, if you lock someone up against their will to facilitate a robbery,  that constitutes kidnapping.  Like in the back room, if you lock the back room.  So if someone came in here now and locked everyone in the closet and took our wallets,  that would be however many counts of kidnapping, which is what happened.  I robbed the casino on a cruise ship.  A casino on a cruise ship?  Yeah.  Really?  How was the getaway?  Did you realize it's kind of, yeah, the getaway is a little rough? 
[02:59:30]  Well, we got away.  How?  What'd you ever get a second boat?  No, well.  Yeah, the jet steam.  Probably docked.  Well, yeah, we went out.  It was, you know, the three-mile cruise to nowhere.  Yeah.  It was one of those, I mean.  Who drove the getaway dinghy?  There was, we went out on the cruise, and once we came back in, we hid and did, you  know, broke out the guns, robbed everybody, and left the ship, got in the car, and got  away.  Sounds like speed, too.  R.  You're a pirate.  Yeah, you know, that's what they said.  Modern-day piracy, you know.  But I was 16, and I think the oldest, somebody ratted us out. 
[03:00:00]  Is that person still alive?  No, he's dead.  Yeah?  He's dead, like, from a heart attack?  No, he got, he was on his motorcycle and got hit by a truck, hit and run driver.  Really?  Oh, Jesus.  Is he on a truck?  He is a truck.  I was still in prison.  It wasn't me.  I didn't do it.  Were you sad to hear about it, or no?  Oh, man, it broke me up.  It broke me up.  Well, you know, it saved me the trouble, because I was going to kill him myself, you know, but,  you know, I just, fortunately, I didn't have to.  Now, you know, I have a beautiful career.  My life is going quite well, and I don't even think about it. 
[03:00:30]  That was years ago.  That's what people ask me about it.  I have to ask you, though, what was I going to, so why would this guy snitch?  You know, his father caught him with, I think he had like 30, 40 grand.  His father caught him with it and asked him where it came from, and he told his father.  Jesus.  So his father took out a second mortgage on the house, got an attorney.  His attorney went to the Broward County District Attorney and said, I can give you the whole cruise  ship robbery case, but my client gets immunity, and that's how that went down. 
[03:01:00]  What the fuck?  So he threw you under the bus for no reason other than the clear of the home country.  He threw you under the boat.  He threw me under the boat, yeah.  So he did no time whatsoever?  No, not a day.  Holy shit.  Not a day.  So 16 is a fucking, prison's a horrifying place for anybody, but 16, were you a big dude  when you went in?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  What I was going to say before you, asking about my confrontation, as a kid, I mean,  if you ask anybody that knows anything about the justice system, the juveniles are the 
[03:01:30]  most violent, and I was from Miami, which is in Dade County, and I got locked up in Fort  Lauderdale, which is Broward County.  Wow.  So I had-  Did you go to Juvie Hall or real jail first?  Well, Juvie Hall for 30 days.  I was in Juvie when I was a kid.  You guys are just alike.  I was in Juvie from 13 to 15.  What did you do to be in Juvie?  I stole a gumball machine.  Exactly.  At the home machine?  Yes.  Wow, that's just like armed robber.  And he's still hiding it under his shirt, too.  And kidnapping.  So MVP, there's an argument to be made that you're one of the greatest prison success stories. 
[03:02:00]  I mean, it rehabilitated you.  I was probably near Bernard Hopkins, yeah.  I think, you know.  Marvin Hagler.  I think he was in jail, too, right?  Oh, there's Richard S. Dutton.  Don King.  No, there's Don King.  There's quite a few.  So you had to learn how to-  Yeah, Don King committed-  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Don King committed two.  He killed two people.  Oh, yeah.  We tried to talk to him about that shit, and he didn't want to-  You ever talk to prisoners?  He didn't want anything.  Not yet.  Not a lot of fans.  There's something I'm working on.  I mean, with the WWE, I have Vince McMahon, and he agrees that I have an obligation to 
[03:02:30]  give back.  Right.  And my concern primarily is dealing with at-risk youth, juveniles, like I was, making bad decisions.  And, you know, like I say all the time, there's just this sense of hopelessness, you know,  in the urban landscape.  You know, just kids feel like, you know, all I can do is sell drugs.  All I can do is hustle.  You know, there's no sense of deferred gratification.  Everything is now, now, now.  And I was caught up in that.  And, you know, when I got out, fortunately, you know, I say all the time, professional  wrestling saved my life. 
[03:03:00]  Because if I hadn't gotten into professional wrestling, inevitably, I would have gone back  to doing, you know, robbery or hustling drugs or whatever the case may be, which would have  led me back to prison or worse.  You know, who knows?  So what was the, what's the, how do you jump into wrestling from a regular guy to a professional  wrestler?  You must have had an interest your whole life.  I've been a fan my whole life.  But when I was in a work release, one of the officers was an independent wrestler.  Wow.  And I used to ask him questions all the time.  And he said, well, you know, when you get out, if you want to learn, I'll teach you.  And I needed a hobby, something to keep me out of trouble and ended up taking the wrestling, 
[03:03:30]  you know, like a fish to water with something that just worked out for me.  What's he doing now?  He's one of my biggest fans.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You know, it's funny because I never really talked to correctional officers.  I think most correctional officers are scumbags.  I mean, pretty much most correctional officers and not all, but most have serious esteem issues.  You know, they, they, they like to go and I guess, yeah, you know, at home, their wife  and kids probably don't respect them.  So they go to prison and, you know, they get to be tough guys because they got, you know, 
[03:04:00]  I don't even want to get in there.  They get to boss around other men.  Well, probably in real life, they could never boss around.  Well, you know, I used to tell them all the time, you, you know, you wouldn't, if, if,  if, if we were in a totally neutral situation, you wouldn't dream of coming out of your mouth  to me like that.  Yeah, but it's like, we ain't, so fuck you.  However, I've seen a number of correctional officers get their fucking heads cracked open.  Yeah.  Because, you know, some guys say, fuck, I got a life sentence.  What are you going to do to me?  Yeah.  So, you know.  Now, but if you're a nice correction officer, aren't things, I knew a guy that was the head 
[03:04:30]  of Rikers for a while.  If, won't that be seen by the convicts as weak?  Not at all.  Not at all.  Not at all.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  You're always going to have guys, you know, going to try to get over.  But, I mean, you know, be hard but fair.  You know, guys respect that.  You know, because in the end, you just want to be treated like a human being.  So, you know, if there's a guy that will consistently is known for, you know, treating guys okay,  other guys will go out of their way to, hey, don't fuck with him.  He takes care of the boys, you know.  And so, you get heat for that.  Were you in a gang or anything?  Like, you know, they separate in prison, like the whites and the... 
[03:05:00]  Oh, Florida's not really like that.  It's not?  Yeah.  I mean, I was in a little street gang when I was a kid, you know, but...  What was...  I mean, like in prison, did you have to join up with anybody or just kept to yourself?  Florida's not like that.  The South is a little different.  It's not like the North or the Midwest.  You know, the gangs, there's not a big gang presence.  White guys need some, like, structure in prison, though.  You know, you got to join the Aryans or something.  Like, if Little Jimmy...  If Little Jimmy went to your prison, would he have to... 
[03:05:30]  Or, without going to prison, you got to join the Aryans.  Whatever.  He'd be fine.  He wouldn't have to, like, do anything for you in prison.  Everybody has a gimmick, you know what I'm saying?  You know, a guy like him, he's funny as hell, you know.  So, if you're cracking jokes all the time, keep people laughing.  Hey, man, that's a funny-ass white boy, man.  He all right, you know.  I would run out with fucking court jester shoes and tap dance to make everybody laugh  until their dicks got soft.  There you go.  See, you're all right.  Just on that.  Hey, what was the wildest thing that happened to you in prison? 
[03:06:00]  It happened to me?  Yeah, one thing that really stands out.  Man, I could tell you some hell of stories, but, you know, I think probably the one thing  that stands out to me above all else is when I got put in confinement for attempting to  set the building on fire, but it never happened.  You know, I just, this guy threw his cigarette in the garbage can and we were joking around  and I was fanning the flames.  But, you know, when I was in prison, I used to hustle a little bit and they never caught  me, so this one officer had a vendetta against me, so I ended up doing 60 days in the hole 
[03:06:30]  for something I didn't even do.  So, there was no fire, there was no flames, no anything, but the disciplinary report was  written up saying that I attempted to commit arson and when I went before the lieutenant,  he told me I'll be placed in administrative confinement while they conduct an investigation.  After that, I'd be found guilty and I'd spend, you know, it was kangaroo court.  He told me I was going to confine, but I was going to spend 60 days in the hole.  Before there was ever any investigation. 
[03:07:00]  What is that like, by the way?  60 days.  It sucks.  Why does it suck, though?  I mean, it sounds like awesome to me.  If I could just sleep all day and eat three meals and just take naps, that sounds awesome.  And not get beaten.  Bobby, talk to nobody.  All you want is 40 hots in a cot.  40 hots in a cot.  What's the thing about that that gets to you?  60 days in the hole.  Where you can't figure out when the days begin?  The prison that I was at, DeSoto Correctional, was a real old, old prison. 
[03:07:30]  So their confinement was hot as hell in the summer and freezing in the winter.  So all you have is your underwear, t-shirt, and a couple personal items.  And it was the wintertime that I was there, so it was freezing.  You would starve to death because the servings they give you, I mean, they don't really give you much food to eat.  And there's nothing to do.  So you're just sitting back there, you know, trying not to go crazy.  So what did you do for 60 days?  Talk to yourself.  I mean, after a while, after I was in there about a month, there was a new superintendent that allowed us to have books. 
[03:08:00]  So, like, the old, ripped-up books from the library.  I mean, you get into a good book, you get about three-quarters through and realize that, like, the rest of the book is missing.  It's gone.  The best part of the book, pages are missing.  Billy Connolly is a comedian from Scotland.  He told a funny story.  I think he did a time in jail over in Scotland.  He said what guys would do is go to the library and they'd get a mystery.  And then the guy that did it, every time his name showed up in the book, they would circle it.  So that you know who did it. 
[03:08:30]  The whole book is going to be for you.  That's fucking low.  What a fucking angry thing to do.  What did, now, what, nine years, you said?  Nine and a half.  Nine and a half.  So what was the first thing you did when you got out?  Like, that day came.  You're like, holy shit, I'm out.  How much sperm did you shoot is what actually said again.  Gallons.  You know, it's funny.  Somebody was telling me the other day about, asking me about porn.  And I was saying that I don't watch porn.  I don't look at porn.  I have absolutely no interest in pornographic magazines. 
[03:09:00]  And I don't masturbate.  And I tell, the only time I touch my dick is to clean it and to insert it.  But, you know, when you have to fucking jack off for nine years, you know, that I have no interest in porn whatsoever.  The day I got out, the very first thing I did as a free man, because when I went in, I was 16.  I got out and I went to my friend's house and I went to the corner store and I bought a beer.  And that was the first time that I was able to legally, you know, buy a drink.  And I hadn't had a drink in 10 years.  Well, you make prison wine.  You know, it's a little different. 
[03:09:30]  But I went and I bought a Heineken.  That was the first thing I did.  And then that night I went home and...  You should get an endorsement deal.  That should, right?  The first chick you banged outside of jail, how long did you last?  Oh, well, it wasn't fair, because I was in work release.  So I was able to get furloughs my last year.  But I'll tell you this.  I was in one prison and I had a female friend that used to come visit me.  Kind of pseudo-girlfriend, sort of. 
[03:10:00]  And that particular prison was really corrupt.  And as a matter of fact, I don't know if you guys remember several years ago,  there was like six guys that tunneled out of a prison in Florida.  I was there when it happened.  I knew those guys.  And that prison was so corrupt that in the visiting park,  you had a group of officers that would work there.  And guys would take up a collection and kind of give them some pocket money.  So they'd be on one end of the visiting park and they'd say real loud,  well, I guess we're going to walk over on this side now.  Kind of give you the heads up.  That's a great thing. 
[03:10:30]  It's like Ralph Cram did.  Whoa, it certainly looks like rain tonight.  Yeah, exactly.  So my girl had a skirt and lots of, you see, everyone was wearing,  all the women would come in wearing skirts and raise it up and slide in.  And I think I lasted about four pumps.  I would be very shy and say, can everybody turn around?  I need my nipples played, but I'm very high nipples.  It's my turn.  Can you guys turn around?  Trust me, after you've been there for a few years,  when the wind blows your shit, you wouldn't need anybody to play with anything.  It's an amazing story. 
[03:11:00]  What about the homosexuality?  It is.  Oh, it's rampant.  It is.  See, no one will admit that.  We talk to friends of guys all the time.  Like, oh, I never saw it.  I never saw that.  It never happened.  If anyone told you they went to prison and didn't see it, they're lying to you.  Oh, you know what?  Those guys are probably the ones getting fucked, and that's why they don't want to tell you that.  How do you keep them getting, I mean, you're a young kid.  How do you keep guys away?  It's real easy.  Generally, the guys that are into that, you know, they take the least path of resistance.  And when I was in there, you know, I was a kid with a chip on my shoulder anyway, and I had a lot of time. 
[03:11:30]  And all the young guys were pretty wild and crazy.  So the guys that were into that shit didn't really want to be fucked up with the young guys anyhow.  So I didn't have a problem with that because I would fight.  So if you fought really nasty or tried to bite someone's dick, the chances are the word would get out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But if you let someone's dick get in your mouth, it's too late.  You're gay.  I always thought that.  Well, that's a rule of thumb.  Well, Jimmy might have a...  I always thought if I was in jail, because I mean, I'm a small dude, and a guy like his size of a big guy was going to try to rape me, 
[03:12:00]  I would try to act interested and go, they suck it.  And then I would fucking bite the head off and spit it out.  Yeah, you'd be all right.  Yeah, I guess you'd only have to do that one time.  I love that you have a plan, but you'd have like a dick in your mouth for it.  Yeah, what if it was too hard and you couldn't bite through all the way?  I'd be very embarrassed if I had bad dental work and my fucking hard dick stayed and my teeth were all stuck in it.  I'd feel like a silly goose.  What if right before you took the bite, you decided, hey, this ain't too bad?  Now, you know the worst thing, in my opinion, about the prison system and the homosexuality, 
[03:12:30]  you got guys, you know, you don't have to rape anybody because there's a whole bunch of what we call punks,  the sissies, they dress out, you know, tie their T-shirts on the side and put on makeup and all that.  So the guys get into that and, you know, for whatever reason, you know, the powers that be think,  well, we're not going to distribute condoms in the prison system because that would encourage homosexuality.  It's taking place anyway. 
[03:13:00]  And, you know, you got all these people lined up to get their AZT and their AIDS medication.  And what always got me, what I understand is that, you know, you know who's got AIDS and they're getting their medication  and guys are still nailing them anyway.  You know, so...  What the fuck?  Didn't they make their own condoms, though?  I mean, you make shanks.  Can't you just make a condom?  You're going to make something that could keep a fucking little organism out of your...  What are you talking about?  What are you going to make a Ziploc bag?  No, burn wax on your cock or something.  Burn wax. 
[03:13:30]  You got problems, man.  Yeah, he certainly does.  Are you sick of talking about the prison stuff?  I'm sure wherever you go.  You know what?  It doesn't bother...  You know what?  And by the way, this guy is huge in the WWE.  But this is an amazing story.  I mean, very few people...  That's why I don't mind talking about it.  Because I'd like to show people that, you know, there's just this, you know, pervading sense of, you know, you're a convicted felon.  When I got out of prison, I couldn't get my own apartment because I'm a convicted felon.  So, you know, you got guys that go to prison and you're supposed to have paid your debt to society. 
[03:14:00]  You start all over again.  You're supposed to be all right.  But as a convicted felon, I couldn't get a job.  I couldn't get an apartment.  So what the hell am I supposed to do?  You know, they wonder why the recidivism rate is so high.  You got, you know, you lock a guy up.  You're sitting in prison for 10 years.  Most prison systems don't really, regardless of what politicians tell you, they don't really have any correctional system.  You know, they don't really have any education.  They have some, you know, you might be able to get your GED.  Some places might have some kind of trade classes. 
[03:14:30]  But ultimately, you got guys doing time, learning how to become better criminals.  And after that 10 years, when they get out, they're pissed off.  And they're coming right back to your neighborhood.  So, you know, they're...  And they're desperate.  Yeah.  I mean, think about it.  If you just did 10 years in prison, you get out.  You can't get a decent job.  You can't get a place to live.  What the fuck are you supposed to do?  Right.  How old are you now?  34.  34.  Oh, so you've been out for eight years.  Okay.  So you've been out.  I got out in July 1999.  Wow.  It's amazing.  Whenever we have a guy in here who's either done time in jail or a guy that fights like Liddell, 
[03:15:00]  we turn into a bunch of fucking fairies.  We, like...  Were they big men?  Did they hit hard?  Was it scary?  He's a man's man.  What do you want us to do?  This guy's the real deal.  I'm a part of it.  I'm criticizing him.  Where's Sam?  Sam's got some wrestling questions.  Yeah, we do.  He does.  Come on.  Sam is a huge fan.  I have one more question before.  The guy whose name you can't mention, when you said you had an ongoing feud, did you dislike  him for real?  I absolutely loved him.  Oh, you did?  It was only part of the show?  No, he...  I'll say this about Chris Benoit. 
[03:15:30]  He was my favorite wrestler.  So, for me, it was an absolute dream come true.  I mean, I'm literally living the dream.  But to wrestle him at WrestleMania was one of my greatest achievements so far.  And to beat him for the United States title.  I mean, just think about whoever your idol is in comedy.  You know, the one person that stands out above all else to you.  To be able to work with them on a regular basis.  You know, for me, it was unreal.  And before I got signed to the WWE, I met him and he took me under his wing. 
[03:16:00]  And he'd call me all the time and ask me about my independent matches.  And he took an interest, an active interest in my career before I got there.  So, when I did make it, you know, when I got signed, he was as excited as I was, if  not more so.  Did you see his personality change near the end there?  Man, that was something that nobody saw coming.  That's what everyone says, could you?  And I believe that, by the way.  I couldn't tell you a single bad...  All I could tell you is, you know, for whatever happened at the end, that guy was one of the  most considerate, thoughtful, caring... 
[03:16:30]  I mean, any positive adjective that you can come up with, I would apply to him.  That's so odd, man.  It's unreal.  And the thing that pisses me off, everybody wants to, you know, just lay it all on steroids.  And that's the most ridiculous thing in the world to me because, you know, it's all about  the fragile human mind.  Something was going on that we didn't know about.  And as best we can tell, he snapped.  But they want to put it on steroids.  The guy in Virginia that shot up all those people, he wasn't on steroids.  You know, people snap all the time. 
[03:17:00]  Unfortunately, I mean, as best we can tell, Chris snapped.  And this isn't like a new belt.  This is an old belt that just keeps getting passed on.  It keeps getting handed on.  Did you have a fucking chick with this belt on?  Just get naked and just wear the belt and just fucking plow her?  Yes, I have.  That'd be awesome just to put that on and fucking smash her.  And the whole time I was, who's the champ?  Who's the champ?  Say it.  Say it.  Who's the champ?  You just have to bust your load.  You throw the belt over your shoulder and go take a shower? 
[03:17:30]  No, I like to make a tap out.  Walk off to your music.  I like to make a tap out.  I like to tap the pillow.  Tap.  Tap.  That would be great.  Then you just leave to go into the bathroom with the music playing.  Belt over your shoulder.  I'm going to have to try that sometime.  Play my intro music and come in.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Let's go to Sam, the big wrestling fan.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, the WWE is sponsoring the Than and Sam show this Saturday night.  Yeah, the Royal Rumble.  Yes.  He's going to bring you the Than and Sam show this Saturday night.  That's right.  When's that Royal Rumble, Sam?  Sunday.  The Royal Rumble is this Sunday night.  I did notice you feel stupid complaining about the breakfast after talking to this guy 
[03:18:00]  about prison.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yo, the stupid little bagels.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead, Sam.  What do you got for MVP?  Am I going to ask original questions?  Are the questions that I was just handed?  Because these are your questions.  Ask away.  What are you wasting this time for?  Ask away.  MVP.  Did you ever consider calling yourself most improved player?  Who wrote that question? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, who wrote that?  Is that your question?  I swear.  Why are you messing with me?  All right, what do you got?  You got a question for him for real.  Okay.  Who is your favorite wrestler?  You just answered that.  I thought so, too.  So go ahead.  All right.  Okay.  If you could be a vegetable, which vegetable would you be?  The hell?  You're about to be a vegetable.  I thought you said this guy was like a real wrestler. 
[03:19:00]  He is a huge fan.  He knows everything.  He gets nervous, though.  Just read the next question, Sam.  Can I have a hug?  Is the question.  He's a real big fan.  He doesn't give you a prison hug, you bitch.  I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.  Yeah.  No, okay.  I wouldn't either.  Me neither.  Is Vontavious a name of...  No, no. 
[03:19:30]  You skipped this one.  Well, if it's...  Okay.  A little nervous to ask that question.  Sure.  Is it true you have to wear a body suit because of a controversial tattoo?  That's false.  You know what's weird?  There's a whole bunch of stuff on the internet that, you know, these, you know, internet marks  that come up with these ridiculous explanations, and there's all kinds of shit on the internet  about me that's absolutely not true.  I love telling the story.  Batista pulled his hamstring, so he was getting his leg taped up for a while, and there was 
[03:20:00]  something on the internet circulating about him getting a new tattoo, and he was taping  up his leg to cover up the tattoo, and people just, you know, took that, oh, yeah, Batista's  got a new tattoo.  Bullshit.  We just know from dealing with message boards on this show that everything is true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's not one false thing on any message board.  What type of tattoo?  They're all smart people that just contribute a lot.  Yeah.  The intellectual giants.  Yeah.  What type of tattoo they're saying you have?  I have a tattoo of Malcolm X on my chest, and, you know, he and I had a lot of parallels 
[03:20:30]  in life.  He was somebody that read his autobiography.  I was really moved by it.  Did he wrestle?  He went to prison.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He absolutely wrestled.  Yeah.  He wrestled all right.  No, that's not cool.  That's okay.  He wrestled.  Yeah.  He wrestled the man.  Yeah.  He fought the man.  By any means necessary.  Fuck that turn the other cheek shit.  Anyway.  You're going to get your ass handed to you, and I'm going to laugh. 
[03:21:00]  I'm just going to sit here and laugh.  Okay.  Which do you like better?  Oh, he skipped one.  Yeah.  Oh.  Is Vontavius a name of Roman origin?  No, Vontavius is a name of ghetto origin.  Fair enough.  Which do you like better, wrestling or prison?  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Who wrote that?  I just got to know.  Who wrote that question? 
[03:21:30]  Please tell me who wrote that question.  Who was brave enough to write that one?  Who's responsible for that one?  Who's the nameless, faceless person that wrote that?  Oh, Than.  Oh, Than.  Wow, Than fessed up to it.  It's the other half of the Than Sam show.  I would have just looked around and went, uh, Danny.  I don't know where he is.  But you know what?  No, there's something to be said for him actually, you know, owning up to that ridiculous fucking question.  That's just, you know.  What motivated that?  You just wanted to throw him under the bus?  Is that what it was?  Yeah, I like, you know, Sam and I have a fun, teasing relationship.  And to make him look like an asshole in front of somebody. 
[03:22:00]  You succeeded.  To destroy him.  All right, good.  Thank you.  You've done an exceptional job.  Thank you.  All right.  And I guess to wrap up this interview.  Make it good.  Okay.  Make it real good.  Where did the Cloverfield monster come from?  Cloverfield monster is Godzilla's cousin.  Oh, okay.  That's my thing on that.  Right.  Retarded cousin.  Okay.  Have you seen the movie theory?  I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know.  It kind of blobs around a little bit, that monster.  Do you really have an X tattoo or that's a rumor that you do? 
[03:22:30]  You do have one?  No, no.  I actually have a picture of it.  I don't know so much, yes.  Sam, is there an honest wrestling question you would like to ask him?  I mean, you are a fan.  You are a fan.  Okay.  Whose idea was the inflatable entranceway that you used?  Because MVP uses an inflatable, like, you know how sometimes the football teams have  the big inflatable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has his very own MVP entranceway that they put in front of the other entranceway.  Virtually everything about the MVP character was my idea or creation. 
[03:23:00]  When I was trying out for the WWE, the vice president of talent relations, John Laurinaitis,  said, you know, I used to wrestle as Antonio Banks.  And he said, man, Antonio, we like you.  We got nothing for you.  Come up with something that we don't already have that you can do and get back with us.  So, I think, when first I was put off by that, I was pissed off.  I'm like, man, that's bullshit, man.  You know, you could hire me.  But at the time, I used to bounce on South Beach, and I was always at the high-end VIP clubs.  And I used to see these pretentious, self-absorbed athletes come in. 
[03:23:30]  You know, these overpaid jerks, treating people like shit.  And who was your dick in particular?  Can you remember one that was fucking rude to you?  Stephon Marbury is a pussy.  Holy shit.  He's a bitch.  And he came this close to catching an overhand right.  He was just rude to you?  Not to me, to the doorman.  You know, he comes up in shorts and sneakers trying to get into, you know, a high-end.  Everyone is wearing Armani and Gucci and, you know, a high-end club.  Which club down there?  And a mansion. 
[03:24:00]  He walks up and expects to get in because he's Stephon Marbury.  Dude, you got on shorts and sneakers.  So the doorman says, I'm sorry, I can't let you in.  And he leans over and tells the doorman, don't make this mistake.  You're making a big mistake.  Don't make this mistake.  I said, man, you're making a mistake.  So he tries to be physically intimidating to the little, you know, doorman.  And I just stepped up.  And the manager kind of grabbed me and pulled me back.  Because, I mean, how many times has he been robbed for his jewelry anyway?  You know what I'm saying?  He's been stuck up at least two, three times. 
[03:24:30]  He's pure pussy.  Fuck him.  If he would have shoved you, would you have knocked his fucking teeth out?  I would have broken his jaw right down Washington Avenue.  Did you let him in?  I don't know if they let him in or not.  I have short tolerance for stupidity.  He's an idiot.  Do you hate any wrestlers?  I mean, when you're fighting, is there any guys out there that you really don't like?  And sometimes you give them a little extra?  You know what?  It's funny you say that.  Because generally, the guys that end up hitting each other hardest are the guys that get along the best. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, the guys.  Because, listen, you're only going to mistreat somebody you really, really dislike.  Or, as in the case of these two guys, somebody you really like a lot, you know?  Right.  So sometimes when you're in there with somebody you're really cool with, you know, you catch them with a really tight punch.  And you laugh about it.  Oh, sorry.  You know it's coming back.  You punch me in the face.  I'm going to punch you.  You kick me, I'm going to kick you.  In our business, we call it a receipt.  You catch a guy, you know you're going to get a receipt, you know?  Sam, remember that.  Start using that every day. 
[03:25:30]  A receipt.  But at any rate, to answer the question, MVP, I went.  And based on those, you know, jackass athletes, I thought, man, there's never been a guy like that in the WWE in professional wrestling.  And, you know, you turn on ESPN, there's always some athlete doing something stupid in the news.  So there'd be no shortage of material.  So, you know, I came up with this whole concept, pitched it to them.  They liked it.  And the rest, as they say, is history.  And I've been very fortunate that creatively, you know, most of the ideas that I come up with, you know, when I pitch them, they're receptive and they go with it. 
[03:26:00]  Or if not, the actual idea is some, you know, derivative or variation.  So I've been real lucky.  I would think, Sam, because of the, even though his name is the initials, because of the MVP thing, you would think it would be sports-related kind of a thing.  So the blow-up, where he comes through like that would probably, you know, fit into that whole motif.  Yeah.  I just thought it was brilliant.  I just wanted to compliment.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  All right.  Well.  You know?  You made up for all the ridiculous questions that you just asked. 
[03:26:30]  I have space in my ass.  That way.  The lottery will get you everywhere.  You have big, excuse me, big jewelry, 305 and then MVP.  Is that a Miami area code?  Yeah, that's Miami.  Representing the MIA.  I kind of figured I just wanted to show off my knowledge.  Yeah.  I bored everyone.  I apologize.  When's the book coming out?  You got a book in you, obviously.  Give it a few years.  You know, I want to see what happens.  I mean, it's funny because I think about in my first year, I've accomplished so much in the WWE,  and I've been real fortunate that they've given me the ball to run with it. 
[03:27:00]  And I said for years, I always, you know, when I wanted to get to the WWE, I said,  if they ever give me an opportunity, you know, just give me the ball.  If I fumble, you know, that's on me.  But, you know, so far, every time they've given me the ball, if I haven't scored a touchdown,  I've at least had positive yardage, you know?  So I think maybe two, three, four years from now, you know, after I've won a few world titles  and, you know, done a few things here and there, be time for a book.  But I definitely wanted to use my story to try to influence and inspire other people that, 
[03:27:30]  hey, man, you know, it's funny, yesterday I was on 106 and Park, and I was telling,  because they have a really young audience, and I was saying,  don't let anybody tell you what you can and cannot do.  Because when I got out of prison and I told people, my own mother, you know,  I said, you know, I'm going to be a professional wrestler.  And she took me to my very first wrestling show.  She kind of looked down her nose at me and was, yeah, okay.  You know, nobody believed me.  And, you know, now I'm the United States champion, so hate on that, you know?  So I want to try to inspire as many people as possible to, you know, chase your dreams, 
[03:28:00]  have the laser beam focus, make the sacrifices.  And as corny as it sounds, man, you can do whatever you want to do if you believe in yourself.  Except rob a casino boat.  Well, I got away with it.  If you got away with it, what was your next robbery?  Like a train?  As a matter of fact, I had one more lined up, and then I was going to retire.  What was it going to be?  I can't tell you that. 
[03:28:30]  Why?  You're still planning on it, and the wrestling goes bad?  It's in my back pocket, yeah.  You don't want to keep that one.  If things don't work out, you know, it's funny, because I was telling somebody the other day,  you know, you got all these, me and Joey V were talking about it.  You got all these, for some reason, you know, being a thug has become this real cool, trendy thing.  Everybody wants to be a gangster.  Everybody wants to be a killer.  And most of these guys, that's my phone.  Most of these guys, they're like, stop talking about this stuff. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, probably.  That's probably what it is.  I like the honesty, to be honest with you.  You're a killer, a gangster, you know, and all the thugs, killers, and gangsters that  I know, don't brag about it.  Don't glorify it.  You know, it's just a way of life.  And when I see all these, you know, these studio gangster rappers coming out, I'm this,  I'm that, you know, man, give me a break, man.  You ain't never busted a grape.  You know, some of these guys, oh, I did time.  You did two years at a boys camp.  You know, you didn't do time.  That doesn't count. 
[03:29:30]  Or, you know, guys rapping about how many times they got shot.  Can I interrupt you?  Please.  If one of us in this studio did two years, the prestige and the, we would have some freaking  power.  If one of us got a fucking parking ticket.  Right.  And had to put the little fucking plastic cups on.  This is why we can't relate, man.  Imagine one of us came in after doing two years.  We would be the king shit in this place.  After a college gig, I pulled a fake gun on Red Shining.  And I got arrested.  Everybody thought I was the coolest guy in the world. 
[03:30:00]  What's MVP, two years, it's a weekend stint, man.  Norton did one night in the tombs.  He was going to get a tear tattoo.  Yeah, Norton can relate to you, MVP.  I did one night.  He did one night.  Hey, you know what, though?  People, you know, I've had people come up to me and say, hey, man, I only did three  months.  But, you know, dude, one day is one day too many, man.  It's an experience that, you know, nobody should have to go through.  You know, I take that back.  There are some people that should be locked up forever and ever.  I was in there with them.  There are some people that should never get out. 
[03:30:30]  There are some people that should have their heads cut off and stuck on a stick.  Pedals.  Oh, yeah.  You know, rapists, pedophiles.  You know, there's no excuse for that.  And those guys get a little extra in the joint, like they say?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  They are hated?  Oh, reviled.  Were you scared?  Like, because I was actually in juvie for a year.  And there was guys that actually did a crime.  Like, my crime wasn't bad, but there was guys that did crimes like yours where they went  to juvie, but then they had to go transition from juvie to real jail. 
[03:31:00]  Well...  Did that scare the shit out of you, going from juvie, knowing that you had to go into  real prison?  It's funny because in the juvenile system in Florida, they have what they call direct  filed, where once you're 15 or 16, if your offense is serious enough, they move you from  the juvenile facility to the county jail, but you're on the juvenile floor.  So you're with other juvenile offenders.  Right.  But once you're sentenced, you know, if you don't have a youthful offender sentence, you  get sent to a regular prison facility. 
[03:31:30]  So there's no differentiation between, you know, juveniles and adults.  So, initially, you know, of course, yeah, damn right I was scared.  You know, I'm going to prison.  I'm 17 years old, and I'm going to be in prison for the next, as far as I knew, you know,  10, 20 years.  Did you think about killing yourself?  No, I thought about killing other people, though.  What was your sentence?  10 to 20?  No, I had an 18 and a half year sentence with a mandatory three, which means for the first  three years, I couldn't get any time off.  No good time.  When were you first eligible for parole? 
[03:32:00]  The state of Florida, they don't have parole anymore.  So you've got to do.  Oh, you've got to do half.  Is there anybody at this point, there has to be somebody who intimidates you or who you  are afraid of?  My ex-wife.  But there's no guys, like, there's no guys you see that you're like, I wouldn't want  to fuck with him?  Oh, yeah, there's plenty of guys I wouldn't want to fuck with.  I mean, I wouldn't want to fuck with Chuck Liddell.  You know, I wouldn't want to fuck with, you know, Quentin Jackson. 
[03:32:30]  I wouldn't want to, but, you know, if it came down to it, you know, got to do what you  got to do.  I feel the same way.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want to, but if I had to.  I mean, like I said, man, you know, I've had my ass kicked more times than most people  have had fights, so an ass whooping, you just add it to the pile.  It's not a big deal.  I've been down that road, but now, you know, dude, I make money, I make a really good living  to play fight in my underwear, you know what I'm saying?  So I'm cool with that.  Great attitude.  Great attitude.  Last fight I had was in fourth grade, Jimmy Biondo. 
[03:33:00]  He pinned me outside the library, and that was the last fight I had.  All these years later, you still remember that, right?  I certainly do.  Would he pin you with his cock?  And if you saw him today, what would you do?  He's dead, but I'd probably be like, wow, how'd you get up with that shotgun blast to the  head?  He's a buddy of mine.  He killed himself?  Yeah.  But I wouldn't be mad at him, though.  No, I saw him for many years.  We were friends.  I was never mad.  It was funny.  He started losing it at the end a little bit. 
[03:33:30]  What a great interview, man.  Yeah, man.  I've had a blast, man.  By the way, this MVP guy, he's becoming huge in the WWE.  They compare you to the Rock and stuff.  Oh, don't say it.  Don't say it.  You don't like hearing that?  They say it, though, right, Sam?  Back me up.  Me and my brothers, we call him the guy whose name shall go unmentioned.  He's the unmentionable one.  Oh, why?  Just because I constantly hear that all the time.  You know, I hate when people say, well, this guy's the next Jordan, or this guy's the next,  you know.  I'm not the next anybody.  I'm the first MVP.  You want to be your own thing.  Okay, that's fair enough.  If I was white or if I was Puerto Rican, would you compare me to him? 
[03:34:00]  That's still a compliment, man.  It's a huge compliment.  There's so many people that watch wrestling just because of him.  When he left, I was done at the time.  You know, I'm starting to come back into it a little bit, to be honest with you.  I mean, his shoes are huge shoes to fill.  You know, and if I can be the individual that becomes that pop culture phenomenon and has  people who don't normally watch wrestling start to tune in just, you know, under the same  circumstances.  That'd be cool.  I'm all for it.  Yeah, right on.  But don't, I don't want to be pigeonholed. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, but it's under your own character and terms and stuff.  Yeah, I'm going to do my thing and, you know.  The journey from the hole to the ring.  But the beautiful thing is, this Sunday, Madison Square Garden, the Mecca, yours truly gets  to wrestle the nature boy, Ric Flair.  And everybody knows Ric Flair.  Can you please kill him?  I'm going to try.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Kill him.  No, really kill him.  No, really kill him.  He's like 58?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, you know what?  Let me say this.  You know, as people say all the time, he's too old. 
[03:35:00]  At 58, I mean, look what he's still doing at 58, 59, something like that.  The man is in tremendous shape and he's still bumping his ass off.  He's still entertaining, you know, millions.  He's incredible.  However, if he loses this Sunday, he's got to retire.  The edict that Vince McMahon handed to him is, you can continue wrestling until you lose.  And when you lose, you've got to retire.  Oh, boy.  That means you lose.  It's a retirement match.  We'll see.  Tune in. 
[03:35:30]  Tune in.  You'd be surprised.  You never know.  That's a lot of pressure.  You could end his career.  That's the goal.  It's my intention to end his career.  Get him out of there.  You know, it's the old meets the new.  Can you braid Sam's hair like you're here?  Could I do it?  Yeah.  Can I look like a bitch to you?  No.  Oh, shit.  Please knock his teeth out.  Oh, Bob Kelly.  No, you didn't.  Why, Bob?  Please.  Bob wants to be beaten by a large man.  Hang on before you guys get carried away because he's not joking around. 
[03:36:00]  Bob just wants to be beaten.  He's actually twinkling his fingers.  I don't like that.  Bob, why would you?  No, I didn't mean you.  Why would you even say that?  I think you jumped the gun a little bit.  No, your question was, can you braid Sam's hair?  That's what you said.  Can you?  Yeah.  Can Sam's hair be braided like yours?  That's true.  You're right.  You're right about that.  You're right about that.  Easy.  Bob's four feet away from him.  Look at that ring on his head, too. 
[03:36:30]  He's right there.  I suck having that imprint on my forehead.  United States champion.  It would just say U.S. like I'm a fucking fat piece of beef.  You got the fat part, right?  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead, Bobby.  Can I be a Jewish kid?  Remember that?  Let's go back to him.  Go ahead.  Keep taunting him, Dusty Rhodes, buddy.  Actually, I think Dusty Rhodes is in a little bit better shape.  This is the worst part.  He can make fun of me, but now I can't make fun of him.  That's what Sam's fault.  What are you going to say about him?  Well, you can.  Go ahead, Bobby.  You can.  He's right there.  There's nothing stopping you. 
[03:37:00]  Go ahead, Bobby.  You heard of Dusty Rhodes?  That's Rocky Rhodes right there.  Thanks for fucking taking it off me.  We got a car crash for him?  Nah.  Anything, Bobby?  No, I got nothing.  You're out of your mind.  Comedians have this need.  That's what happened to me before.  I made fun of him, got on a thing, and then I backed off.  We can't help it.  First of all.  Comedians have a need to do this.  I got into it with Jericho when he was here.  Not intentionally, but it happened.  These guys.  I heard about that.  Yeah, it became a phenomenon for a while. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, it was fine.  It's cool.  But it was like one of those things where we have this need to push the envelope, but it's  like the reality is it really is silly.  We shouldn't have that need.  It could mean someone dies.  Yeah, it could mean you're telling a story about how your fucking jaw got shifted.  Yeah.  At least if you were going to be paralyzed, it would be by someone very famous.  Yeah.  You know.  So you would have a good story to tell through your straw.  This is not a guy.  Because that's your career.  Once your jaw healed up and you had the bolts taken out.  Oh, sure.  Now you never eat the same. 
[03:38:00]  Fuck, it's never straight.  You're trying to drool out of the side a little bit like fucking Siskel or Ebert.  Which one is still alive?  Both of them at this point.  Old feedback face.  MVP, you're like doubly intimidating because you're well-spoken.  And a lot of wrestlers are dumb, so you make fun of them.  They don't really come back.  What do you mean by that?  You're not like that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you didn't.  You didn't.  What did I say?  I'm complimenting him.  I don't believe that.  This is a man who obviously read a lot of books in prison.  He's not intimidated by our ridiculous jokes.  He sits right there.  He doesn't even laugh.  Doesn't even affect him. 
[03:38:30]  Well, I haven't laughed because you haven't said anything funny.  That's good.  But if you say something funny, I promise you'll laugh.  Oh, wow.  I wasn't saying it as an insult.  I was saying it as a compliment.  That was weird.  No, in all seriousness, though, you know, I love stand-up comedy.  I'm at Caroline's this weekend.  I'd love to have you.  It's good to let him know where he can find you after hours.  Yeah.  When no one's listening.  That's real smart, Jeffrey.  Hope he sits right up front.  Yeah, that's real smart.  No, you know, in all seriousness, though, there's a lot of parallels between stand-up comedy  and professional wrestling.  You don't realize it. 
[03:39:00]  But, you know, you guys have to work a crowd.  And, you know, you have to have your timing.  You know, and if you go in with prepared material and that crowd's not responding to your material,  you got to...  Plan B.  You know, plan B.  You got to be...  You got to improvise.  And a lot of the time, you know, we do the same thing just in a different way.  We entertain the crowd.  And sometimes you might have an idea of what we're going to do.  And the crowd, they don't want that.  And, you know, you do something off the cuff.  And, you know, hey, they responded to that. 
[03:39:30]  And you go down that vein.  You know, you guys get up in front of an audience.  You work in the crowd.  You're dying.  And then you make an offhanded remark.  They respond to that.  And, okay, that's what we're going to do now.  It's a lot of similarities.  You know, you go out there and it's just you and your audience.  When I'm in the ring, it's me and the other guy and, you know, 20,000 people.  And when you die in that ring, if you blow it, you blow it by yourself.  You know, so when I see a comedian on stage and he's bombing, I can feel that.  I've been there.  I've done that.  But it's worse for you because you're in your underwear.  This is true.  No, this is true. 
[03:40:00]  I can't even be mad.  You're right.  You're right.  There's 20,000 of them.  I couldn't imagine me being out there in a leotard.  You make a very good point.  I'm not in front of 50 people.  I actually set you up for that.  I hope you realize that.  50,000.  So it's a big difference.  50,000.  Is that the most you've ever performed in front of?  What was the restaurant?  Probably more than that.  Was it 89,000?  It's more than that.  Detroit was about 77,000 people in Detroit.  But most nights it's like 16,000 to 20,000 people, right?  Basketball arena, typically. 
[03:40:30]  Still get nervous?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  I used to.  But I take that back.  You know, there's on occasion, right before I go out, there's that little rush of anxiety.  But as soon as I pass through the curtain, man, it's just, it's gone.  So cool.  It's on.  Are you married?  Yeah.  You're married?  Yeah, but I'm on the way out.  Oh, you're getting divorced.  Yeah.  Is this number two on the way out?  Well, when I said ex-wife, I meant, you know, my soon-to-be ex-wife.  Oh, you're still unraveling that.  She's spectacular. 
[03:41:00]  God's fee there.  She can't put up with me anymore.  Wait, she's going to get wrestling money?  Uh, yeah.  Instead of getting prison money, she gets wrestling money?  Well, she was down with me when I was in prison.  Yeah, well, give her the prison money.  I came out, she was the one.  I don't see her taking bumps in the ring.  What happened?  Fame?  Pressure?  Nah, you know what?  She's a, what's going on out here?  I think that's your audience.  I like the fact that you're married.  We told them to get the hell out.  We told them to get the hell out before we got to leave, so we don't got to, like, be with  the riffraff. 
[03:41:30]  Bye, guys.  You guys are lucky, man.  I got to work my way through that crowd.  Oh, no.  No.  We're way beyond that.  That's one thing about the garden.  Out of all the buildings that, you know, we go to, the parking lot is across the street,  so when you go into the building, you have to walk through the fans.  Yeah.  So you got people reaching out, trying to touch you in on any other building.  You go around the back, and they can't exactly get to you, but, you know, only New  York City, man.  You got to walk through the crowd.  We're all in the street, through the crowd, man.  Yeah.  Are you liked or hated by wrestling fans?  Are you a good guy or a bad guy?  Are you a heel?  I'm a bad guy, but everywhere I go. 
[03:42:00]  Look at Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a bad guy.  He's not confirming everything you're saying by nodding.  It's not a bad guy.  Yes, and I was like, no, I know that.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's a heel.  It's not a bad guy.  It's a heel.  That's what they call it.  And what's the good guy called?  Yeah.  What is a good guy?  What's a good guy called?  A very nice person.  A big toe?  It's a good guy, bad guy.  It's a pro?  What do you prefer, a bad guy or a heel?  Baby face.  Heel.  That's the two.  There you go.  Heel's baby.  Right.  Like Sam.  Sam's a baby face.  Well, you can beat Ric Flair. 
[03:42:30]  You can make a transition to good guy.  No, Ric Flair's loved right now.  A lot of people love him.  They want to see him beat me.  I know what a twink is.  I love when someone turns heel.  That is one of the most dramatic moments in wrestling.  When someone turns heel, you're like, what does he do?  Why is he hitting him?  Holy shit, he turns.  That used to be the greatest.  When they turn heel like that.  That's a big dramatic moment.  That is great.  Especially when it's your favorite wrestler and you almost break down and cry. 
[03:43:00]  What's he doing?  He's hitting him.  They're best friends.  When the bad guy who everybody despises runs in to say that good guy and he becomes,  oh yeah, you hate the guy and then you love him.  That's one of the things that I love about what I do so much, the emotion involved.  When I put Matt Hardy out of commission, you had little kids in the audience, grown women  that were crying.  I've had people throw shit at me and tell me, in the South especially, I'm from the South,  but not too long ago I had a woman tell me her exact words, after what you did to Matt 
[03:43:30]  Hardy, I'm going to cut you.  That's exactly what she said.  Wow.  And I thought, man, that's great.  For me, that's great though.  If I can bring that kind of emotion out of somebody where they really hate me, they really  want to hurt me.  I got to tell you, I thought our fans were scary.  What?  Wrestling fans are way scarier.  It's exactly the same.  They are such that we have crossover audience.  That's ridiculous.  I think we got a lot of the same fans.  If you beat Ric Flair, you might get to wrestle Chief J. Strongbow. 
[03:44:00]  Wow.  If you can pull that off, that'd be amazing.  Why do you think it's you and him this time?  You know what?  In a nutshell, I am everything Ric Flair used to be.  Interesting.  You know, I'm a younger, better looking, more athletic person than Ric Flair.  I'm with that.  He used to dress up like really in suits all the time too.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  I actually sat next to the Big Show on First Class once and he took up. 
[03:44:30]  No, don't lie.  You didn't sit next to the Big Show.  Yeah, I did.  But you guys couldn't sit next to each other.  There's no way.  He couldn't.  I actually offered him the window seat and he was like, I can't sit there because my  head hits the ceiling.  I have to sit in the aisle.  And he was breathing like this.  The whole time.  Well, he's lost about 100 pounds.  He's a big motherfucker.  He's one of the biggest human beings I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, no, he's huge.  If he holds a 12-ounce soda can in his hand, you can't see it. 
[03:45:00]  He can hold it just like that and engulf the whole can in his paw.  That's crazy.  He has a big hand.  He's a big boy.  Just like Sam.  Yeah.  Show him, Sam.  My hand's not that big.  Show him your thumb.  Sam does have a big hand.  My thumb's pretty big, right?  Your thumb is pretty black.  Nothing on you is big.  You've got a big black thumb.  I was going to tell you something about that thumb, but I'll just leave that out.  Give you a suggestion.  Yeah.  Something you can do with that.  Well, let's get MVP out of here. 
[03:45:30]  This was great.  I had a blast.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, thank you, man.  Thanks for the honesty, by the way.  Oh, no, no problem.  You know what I'm going to tell you guys?  I had heard of Opie and Anthony, and I'd never had the chance to hear you guys, never listened  to the show, but now you have a brand new fan, and I've always heard good things, by  the way, but you guys treated me well.  I had a really good time, and any time I get a chance.  Anytime.  Yeah, cool.  Thanks a lot.  We've had a good time with the wrestlers over the years.  Yeah, the Royal Rumble.  Is this Sunday on pay-per-view?  WWE.com. 
[03:46:00]  It's sold out from Madison Square Garden.  It's sold out in two hours.  Of course it did.  So you're not going to get tickets.  You've got to watch it on pay-per-view.  This Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern.  Are you going to it?  Oh, I'm going to it, yeah.  Call your local cable operator, or go to WWE.com.  And Friday Night Smackdown, which is my show, CW Network, 8 p.m. Eastern time, and what  else we got coming up, Joe?  Anything else?  Oh, we got Raw on Monday nights, USA.  I'm not concerned about Raw.  That's not my show.  Okay.  I'm a Smackdown guy, you know? 
[03:46:30]  No, WWE.  Raw is Monday night, and Smackdown is Friday night, but Smackdown is my show.  As a matter of fact, we should just call it the Friday night MVP show.  He's half man, he's half amazing, he's a United States champion, and he just very well  might retire Ric Flair on Sunday.  That I hope happens.  You never know.  I'm not a big Ric Flair fan.  Nah.  But here's the cool thing.  I came in a United States champion, and hopefully in the very near future, I'll come back world  champion, and we'll do this again.  Absolutely.  That's it, with the whirly-whirly bird belt. 
[03:47:00]  Who's got that right now?  Is that Christina?  No, well, that's the WWE championship.  Actually, Raw has the WWE title and the Intercontinental title.  Smackdown has the world championship and the U.S. championship.  Oh, so you don't get the whirly-bird?  Not the whirly-bird one.  Sam's got that one.  The giant gold one.  You get the big...  That one's better, though.  That one's...  I like it better.  That looks more official.  Yeah.  I don't want the spinny one.  That's kind of crazy.  You pry the jewels out of it.  Take them down to a porn shop. 
[03:47:30]  But Mr. Lamada, the belt of a champion's a very rare item.  These are the jewels from the belt.  From the belt.  You know, my kids, Jake!  Idiot.  You're fucking hammering a championship belt with dishes stacked.  Stalker Patty wants a picture with MVP?  Is Stalker Patty...  We have Stalker Patty.  I want a picture with MVP.  Patty, you're a big wrestling fan?  My boss is.  He's in a wrestling club.  Oh, dude.  A wrestling club.  You can email a picture of me and MVP. 
[03:48:00]  You know, email a picture to him.  Give E.T.'s body back.  You really...  MVP, yeah.  The look on MVP's face says it all.  She's 52 or 53 at this point.  I'll be 53 in June.  Don't rush me.  And she's a virgin.  Yeah, she's never known the pleasures of a man.  No wonder.  You rarely see a virgin.  No wonder.  Yeah, I mean...  Even after like 10 years in prison, would you? 
[03:48:30]  Like the first day you're out?  No, not the first day I'm out.  No, hell no.  But, you know, if I was in, yeah, I'd have knocked it down.  Hell yeah.  Do you have a camera, Patty?  Yeah, Patty, why don't you get your picture?  Because we've got to get out of here for the weekend.  What's bothering us?  All right.  She's a big star.  Will you get your picture and get the fuck out of here?  Patty, what?  No, I was seeing somebody had a phone that had a camera.  Oh my God, she doesn't even have a camera.  Thanks a lot.  God bless, man.  Doesn't even have a camera. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you, bro.  Oh, thanks, bro.  Oh, man.  That was great.  Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  All right.  MVP, leaving the studio.  I'm going to get a shot with a Patty.  Please, my camera.  Thanks, bro.  You got something else?  Yeah, just real quick.  If anyone wants to check it out, down at the South Street Seaport, we have our Road  to WrestleMania Fan Access Tour, Matt Stryker signing autographs today, tomorrow to Highlanders,  and Mr. MVP's opponent on Sunday signing autographs, Ric Flair.  So come out, check it out.  It's open until 8 o'clock tonight, and we hope to see you guys there. 
[03:49:30]  And thanks so much for the plugs.  By the way, you knew a lot about the show, but you forgot Ron and Fez, noon to 3.  Ron and Fez, noon to 3.  Yeah, you better get that.  And big plug for the Than and Sam show tomorrow night.  9 to 12.  Jeff Ross at Caroline's.  They got antagonized MVP most of the time at Caroline's.  I'm going to be at the Stress Factory, dude.  If you want to mention that, I'll be at the Stress Factory.  Bob Kelly's Stress Factory.  Jimmy's going to be home sick all weekend.  No plugs, I'm not feeling well. 
[03:50:00]  He's sick.  Jimmy, not feeling very well, so no plugs.  All right.  He was just telling me about Ron and Fez.  Right.  I used to live when I was in DeSoto Correctional just outside of Tampa, and I used to listen to  the Ron and Ron show.  Holy shit.  95 YNF.  Ron Diaz, Ron Bennington, Tampa Bay's, bad boys.  It's the Ron and Ron show.  Ron and Ron.  I had no idea that they were still around, or at least one of them is.  Come on by and say hi.  Fez was just a character on the show.  Now Fez is the cold.  Yeah, come on and say hi. 
[03:50:30]  He would love to have you, man.  Ron and Ron.  I don't know if people understand how huge those fuckers were in Florida.  Oh, in Tampa.  They were just massive.  Yeah, in the Tampa area.  Orlando too, right?  That was before they were syndicated.  I think they were just on 95 YNF, which was just in Tampa area.  And then they started spreading out a little bit all over Florida.  Yeah, they were big.  They had a hell of a show.  I enjoyed it.  I heard the one guy, Ron, who I never met, died.  I think he died.  No, no, no.  Was he not dead?  No, his wife did.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  So he's alive.  He's not on radio anymore.  I don't know. 
[03:51:00]  I'm not trying to blow it off.  I don't know what the story is.  Is he in radio still?  In Tampa, yeah.  Oh, all right.  I showed you what I did.  Okay.  And again, thank you guys for having us.  And if you want to meet MVP, come out to Best Buy on Fifth Avenue tonight.  Be signing autographs, 5 to 7 o'clock.  Come on out.  I'd fire him.  Damn.  Because now the interview is winding down.  It's kind of the boring stage of the interview.  Most people have tuned out.  Well, how can we make it more fun?  You want me to fight for somebody?  Box somebody?  They're checking out the Zeppelin channel.  And then you finally get the plugs in for the great MVP. 
[03:51:30]  Well, the great MVP has such a great story.  You didn't want to interrupt.  I agree with the publicist.  I agree with it.  Where is he going to be again tonight?  Where is he going to be?  Best Buy.  Best Buy, Fifth Avenue, 5 to 7.  Great.  Thank you very much, guys.  You guys are the best.  I appreciate it, bro.  Thanks for everything.  All right.  There they go.  That was awesome.  I was.  Yeah.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on Twitter.  26 world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute snow conditions. 
[03:52:00]  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  That's right.  It's time for your line of the day.  Line of the day.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  You were in prison.  Prison.  I did nine and a half years.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay.  So it wasn't parking violations.  Did you just get out because you looked like a young guy?  I went in when I was 16.  I got out when I was 26.  Oh, wow.  Were you arrested by the fashion police?  Whoa.  Oh.  I, uh, I'm going to leave now. 
[03:52:30]  Hey, uh.  Oh, that was a line of the day.  Jeffrey Ross with a runner-up line of the day.  He's going to be a Caroline tonight.  That's going to be a reminder to that.  That wasn't too uncomfortable.  That was great.  The first time.  That was great.  Now that he's not here, that was awesome.  No, he's still here.  He's signing chairs for Sam.  Sam, you're such a fan boy.  Wouldn't it be funny to hit Sam with his chair?  Can you hit the, uh, can you hit Sam with the chair?  His apple would just make it dull.  Sam was, uh, talking.  He wants you to put him in some kind of hold.  That really hurts.  Right, Sam? 
[03:53:00]  I don't remember saying that, but I guess so.  I guess so.  All right, here's another runner-up line of the day.  Dash.  Chiseling boozy.  Of course he is.  There's nothing on him chiseled.  How would he know what that means?  Bob Kelly at the Stress Factory.  Yep.  Seven, two, three.  Seven, three, two, five, four, five.  Seven, two, three.  Ha ha.  What is it?  Seven, three, two, five, four, five.  Ha ha.  Yes, for tickets.

Oh my God.  Oh, forget it.  That's the Carolina's number?  Yes.  I love the number.  Pound on the numbers.  And Jimmy's number is.  No, don't you mind it, bro.  I'll get a bevy of calls.  Yes.  SkiColoradoNow.com.  Thank you.  We're going to have to weigh the people and the biggest gainer on Monday.  We've just got to do it that way.  Is that okay with everybody?  Or Tuesday of next week?  We'll figure it out.  Whatever.  We'll do whatever's right for the show.  All right, Jimmy.  I hope you feel better. 
[03:54:00]  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  We followed by a swept up linoleum floor and somebody being comforted.  Drop it in the toilet in the ladies room.  See if the women walk around concerned for each other. 
[03:54:30]  STP.  Oh, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Fuck.  Oh, is that a good one?  Well, more from that tape on Monday.  We're back live, obviously.  Fuck you.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  All right, guys.  We'll see you on Monday.  Bye, everybody.  All right.  Love you, guys.  Thanks.  Later, man.  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the fruit roll-up factory. 
[03:55:00]  Making a fruit roll-up.  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that's so much better than your Americans.  Because I, you know, what do you, let me just, well, you already know, but.  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American. 
[03:55:30]  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should, uh, need to know.  Okay, back to work. </pre>
