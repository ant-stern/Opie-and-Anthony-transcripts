<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing dissection of Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and mayoral campaign.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton analyzed newly released explicit messages and photos from Weiner, focusing on his alias, "Carlos Danger," and mocking his press conference with his pregnant wife.  Audio clips from the press conference were played, highlighting Weiner's attempts at damage control and his wife's strained support.  Interns Jackie, Kenny, and later Denny, hilariously, albeit awkwardly, role-played Weiner and his sexting partners, reading excerpts from the explicit messages.  The segment transitioned briefly to Geraldo Rivera's infamous revealing selfie, further fueling the discussion on public figures' indiscretions in the digital age.  The overall tone was irreverent and highly critical of Weiner's behavior.

The show then pivoted to a furious condemnation of Alex Rodriguez's baseball career and public image, utilizing profanity and derogatory terms.  His possible lifetime ban and its financial implications were discussed, comparing him unfavorably to Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.  Rodriguez's situation was briefly compared to that of Aaron Hernandez.  This transitioned into promotional material for their upcoming Montreal live broadcast, their podcast (episode 11), and a past podcast segment about testicular abuse and bees.  They bantered about Montreal travel plans and restaurants, using the term "food cuisine" repeatedly as a running joke.

Numerous listener calls followed. Some focused on Montreal's food, nightlife, and local attitudes.  Others contributed off-color jokes, speculation about beaver tails (compared to bacon), and a lengthy discussion about Joe Rogan's new show, "Joe Rogan Questions Everything," on Syfy, which focuses on Bigfoot and other fringe topics. Rogan joined the show, discussing the plausibility of Bigfoot, his investigation experiences, and other show topics like transhumanism. The recurring nonsensical catchphrase "Mimi Beardsley" emerged throughout this segment.

The show then veered into a bizarre discussion of simulated realities, the fractal nature of the universe, quantum physics, and the observer effect.  This led to a discussion of remote viewing, the CIA's remote viewing program, Ed Dames' claims about Osama Bin Laden's location, and the reliability of psychic claims. UFOs, Project Blue Book, and the plausibility of sightings given advancements in experimental aircraft were also discussed.  The conversation touched upon supersonic travel, space exploration (including inflatable space habitats), and space debris.  Joe Rogan again promoted his show.  The Anderson Silva vs. Chris Weidman rematch was also mentioned.

The show took a drastically vulgar turn with numerous callers recounting shocking and often disgusting anecdotes from their food service jobs, including food tampering incidents (licking watermelon, contaminating gravy, placing genitalia on bread). Callers shared bizarre sexual experiences, with one admitting to sex with a donut.  One host shared a story about a manager sabotaging burgers, and there was unsubstantiated speculation about a fighter's genital mutilation.  A brief respite came with a discussion of the movie "The Conjuring."  Highly offensive language was used throughout.

The final segment started with a discussion about hot dog expiration and unsanitary practices in movie theaters.  Caller Ryan described employees contaminating popcorn and other items, including an alleged anal insertion and removal of Swizzlers.  Caller Eric shared a story about spiking a drink with Tabasco sauce. Caller Chris discussed his satellite radio subscription and his reliance on the Opie and Anthony channel, sharing a humorous story about a customer service representativeâ€™s reaction. The hosts briefly discussed their Montreal trip and banking plans, incorporating jokes about bank names. A discussion about a Stacey Keebler YouTube video and its questionable camerawork and working title "Best of Trayvon" (which had no relation to the content) devolved into sexual jokes. The segment ended with the hosts promoting their YouTube channel, their Montreal show, and preparing to leave for the airport.

[00:10:30]  look at the big smile yeah the head's poking up from the cubicle behind him are the funniest part  of the city of new york like what um i have said that other texts and photos were likely to come out  and today they have as i've said in the past these things that i did were wrong and hurtful to my wife  and caused us to go through many challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from 
[00:11:00]  congress ah while some of the things that have been posted today are true and some are not  there is no question that what i did was wrong this behavior is behind me i've apologized to my wife  puma and i'm grateful that he has she has worked through these issues what's going on hold on  what's going on he's carlos the jerk hole  oh my god he loves jacking off he's fucking finished this guy is a complete joke 
[00:11:30]  wow why is he downplaying in this news conference like he's leaving i did this but he's leaving out  the fact that this new one came after he left congress oh my god he said which went beyond my  resignation so he he tried to hint at it right there is a year after though that's saying well 
[00:12:00]  i think so yeah this was last august i think it was yeah july a year yeah a year yeah last july  maybe he thought after he left congress he had nothing to lose he's like fuck it  so i just don't sex right might as well might as well continue sexting i have nothing to lose i  lost my gig right it was one or the other and he has nothing else to do he's probably bored  and then all of a sudden like to work all of a sudden he starts realizing oh my god i could actually  make a comeback oh shit he did some things well that stuff probably won't come up oh fuck i hope 
[00:12:30]  they don't come up your your rant on health care got me wet what an idiot this guy is well you should  have went huh what right but he's an egomaniac he assumed that you know people really enjoyed his  health care rants whose pussy got wet hearing him yell about health care oh it's not a sexy subject  oh your cancer rant made me cum what your health care rant especially she said he's thinking luckily  i used the name carlos danger so this won't come back yeah no one will know yeah carlos danger 
[00:13:00]  yeah what the fuck tied up all the loose ends with that one oh yeah he's he's smarter than we are  carlos danger carlos he's an international man of mystery that really is danger anyway let's go  back to the press conference her forgiveness i want to again say how very sorry i am to anyone 
[00:13:30]  who has received the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused  and my wife as i have said my wife and i have said are moving forward together um to some degree with  49 days left until primary day um perhaps i'm surprised that more things didn't come out sooner  uh i'm responsible for this behavior that led us to be in this place um but in many ways things are  not that much different than they were yesterday oh yes they are behavior that i did was problematic 
[00:14:00]  to say the least destructive to say the most caused many stresses and strains in my marriage but i'm  pleased and blessed that she has given me a second chance for the past several months i've been asking  new yorkers to also give me another chance to show them that i had a vision for the middle class and  those struggling to make it and then i wanted to move forward um right into her vagina and then back 
[00:14:30]  to be curious about it and i'm going to be there and try to answer those questions as best i can  it is also perfectly understandable that all of you are doing your job being here in these great numbers  and i'm sure it's not just because of the mayoral forum we're going to have in a few minutes um but  all that being said let me just stick around for the mayoral forum how sorry i am that i i did these  things and um how sorry i am to other people that got these messages for any inconvenience or 
[00:15:00]  he's lying of course he is now some have asked the question where does this fit in some timeline some  timeline of the continuum of the resignation uh look the the resignation was not a point in time  that was nearly as important to my wife and me as the challenges in our marriage and the challenges  oh my god um and working through them um some of these things happened before my resignation some 
[00:15:30]  of them happened after but the fact is that that was also the time that my wife and i were working  through some things in our marriage i'm glad these things are behind us i know that this is a very  public thing that we had happen to us um but by no means has to change the fundamentals of my my feelings  here and that is that i like jerking off yeah to bring my vision for the people of the city of new 
[00:16:00]  york i hope they're willing to still continue to give me a second chance and i hope third chance  now you dummy anyways um what happened today was something that frankly had happened before but it  doesn't represent all that much that is new and now i have a chance to do something i haven't had a chance  to do um fuck my wife as you know who's been out there with me recently and she had a few words  that she wanted to say so um my amazing wife amazing wife well if she was amazing yeah my lousy sexting 
[00:16:30]  wife right my wife who writes lol every time i write cock or fuck right my wife who's obviously a horrible  lady uh oh jesus but you know what in a weird way this is what we get the people like the apology  it's it's been proven so he should be humiliated to say this oh my god he should be in hiding well  this was early yesterday so i mean yeah look at the papers he's humiliated i think he's surprised 
[00:17:00]  it made the front page he's hoping to get buried i didn't hear what umma had to say what did um  good evening she's smiling um as many of you who have followed this campaign now uh i've spent a  good deal out on the campaign trail um at churches and street fairs um she doesn't know what to say  um mention more things so this is the first time i've spoken at a press conference and um you'll have 
[00:17:30]  to bear with me because i'm very nervous and i wrote down what i wanted to say look at anthony when  you're laughing i jerked off when we faced this publicly two years ago it was the beginning of  a time in our marriage that was very difficult and it took us a very long time to get through it  our marriage like many others like many others you know we all like being with our husband that 
[00:18:00]  jerks off and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where i could forgive anthony  it was not an easy choice in any way oh but i made the decision that it was worth staying in this  power i made the decision that was a decision i made for me for our son your son and for our family 
[00:18:30]  i didn't know how it would work out but i did know that i wanted to give it a try  anthony's made some horrible mistakes  first before he resigned from congress and after but i do very strongly believe that that is between  us in all our marriage well not anymore in every paper we discussed all of this before anthony decided 
[00:19:00]  he would run for mayor so really what i want to say is i love him i have forgiven him i believe in him  oh and as we have said from the beginning we are moving forward thank you very much thank you for  oh boy she is beautiful man she's really hot yes now what happens does he take questions yeah oh yeah  no prank questions got through unfortunately but do they ask about this yeah yeah that this would be the 
[00:19:30]  topic of conversation well how would you best relieve the traffic problems in our fair city mr danger mr  danger danger candidate danger yes oh god candidate danger yes carlos and he responds to a candidate  danger danger oh my god this is so ridiculous uh you want to hear him uh answer a few questions about 
[00:20:00]  i certainly do okay let's take one or two questions one or two  did your wife find out that there were messages after the resignation she knew all all along no she  didn't this process as i was more and more honest with her um could you pause that that is so telling 
[00:20:30]  he goes she was aware of this all along and then realized no not all along the process and then uh  as we worked through this and i became more and more honest with her no as she dug up more  shit and you had to fucking fess up to it as she continued to go what the fuck is this you don't  become more and more honest you become less and less deceptive because you're caught you know a year 
[00:21:00]  in a year after the scandal she must have are you still fucking doing this yeah yeah exactly are you  fucking kidding me yeah it's like oh we talked about that no yeah honey of course i'm still doing this  much much oh i i thought when i thought with her you didn't want me to do it right oh you mean with  anybody oh see i thought i see i see i thought if i changed my name yes oh honey i thought you knew  that's why i resigned i thought you talked about that i could still do this see we need to communicate 
[00:21:30]  better right obviously there's a communication problem here yes this is pretty much just this is just as  much as much on you as it is on me right right see anthony wiener stopped yeah yeah but carlos danger  carlos danger still needs to ah there's some coming in carlos danger and in your ass only  a view of my cock 
[00:22:00]  brown finger  brown brown finger he's the man the man with the smelly touch  oh man more and more honest this guy's a clown he's a clown he is a clown he just is trying to look  for loopholes where he could still jerk off yeah he's just a clown well i'm going to hear him answer 
[00:22:30]  a few questions thunder balls this is something we knew i'm going into the station about whether i would run  is this over are you are you in touch with any women right now  you know this is this is this is entirely behind me it was when we decided to when i decided to get  in and we had this conversation that is why if you remember in the early days of the campaign people 
[00:23:00]  were pressing me for is there more out there and i said yes i said i said that i said that there was and  so when were they made that's the biggie we didn't ask when yeah yeah ask that you asked i said there  might be more out there i didn't say it might be from last week i got a question uh-huh anthony weiner  worse than bobo for falling for online skills i just want to throw that out there oh no that's a 
[00:23:30]  question today all right i'm carlos danger all right why can't i be carlos danger this girl likes me she  liked my speech let's go to the meds game i'm carlos danger all right with my sidekick mr balloon again  he's a sh-doodle 
[00:24:00]  man arrow oh my god this is why um satellite radio was invented because we get to read these things  uncensored uncensored in a minute or two that's the only way but first more of the press conference  just acknowledged that we that we knew might come up and we decided that look this was something that  we had worked through together something and put behind us and something we wanted to to keep behind  us but as i've said it's in our rearview mirror but it's not far we still work every day 
[00:24:30]  it's not far we still work every day  it's not far we still work every day  but when you said that there was more out there you didn't say there was more out there  and the point after you resigned  how do you explain that in his latest  how do you explain that one  in his latest chat it was as recent as august in the last year  what do you love after you resigned  oh yeah i mean this is this i said there were more things out there there were 
[00:25:00]  this is you have as a fixed time the resignation as the important moment in the public discussion  that was when the public got a glimpse  what is he a time traveler someone has to say this  when he said there's more out there it was around the time he was stepping down  yeah so everyone could accept that part of it right but he did it after that that's the problem  everyone has here 14 months later he's time traveling they're trying to say the stuff i  did after i resigned is what i kind of told you was you know it was a possibility it was out there 
[00:25:30]  what's he talking about he said it again after i think that when he came back i think he said oh  there's more out i think he said it again when he came back this is the this is the problem you don't  need yeah just play it i i was trying to figure out his timeline because he says he's he said initially  he's trying to be clever and vague where where look i told you there was more out there but he didn't  really yeah he initially said there's going to be more of this right there's more out there right and 
[00:26:00]  then when he ran for mayor he said now remember there's more out there but he had made more in  between right he made more is the is the problem thank you that's a better way to put it he's not  made more he made more but he's trying to say no you know there's more out there  that residual stuff right right residual right he wants people to kind of think it was residual  like all that that old thing holy fuck i hate this i i don't like this guy yeah he's a real  arrogant scumbag he is an arrogant right yeah because he thinks he's smart he thinks he's smarter than 
[00:26:30]  everybody else yeah that's what it is jimmy yeah no one's perfect i mean please but but there's  something about this guy that's really hateable now i don't yeah i don't care about his sex thing  it's it's this shit that i hate him right his arrogance about it yeah carlos danger i get  yeah yeah just can't get fucking that's the part that i'm probably fine with who knows what his  wife is like maybe she's a lame fucking texture maybe he tries to be dirty with her and she gives  him nothing hillary doesn't i'm doing it doesn't even have hillary i'm i'm i'm i'm shaving down her 
[00:27:00]  cankles oh god just to shave hillary's cankles with a fucking razor oh what a great job to have  uh into something that we have been working on before during and since and this behavior of mine  was part of that and when we we went through this process and we became closer and work through through  some of these challenges challenges we put it behind us and i put it behind me and frankly we're in a lot 
[00:27:30]  better place today or else i would not have run for may i can't i can't say exactly uh sometime last  summer i think i think wait wait what was the answer what was the question what was the last one you  sent i think he's like i i can't say sometime last summer i think no which is not true of course 
[00:28:00]  it's not what a fucking asshole how could it be what do you mean i think you would know at this  point when was the last time right uh probably two weeks uh before the scandal broke that would  have been the acceptable answer he goes i he throws i think in there because he knows that there's more  and he's just praying that they don't pop up either yeah i think you can't just throw i think in you  you would know yeah specifically when oh yeah when it ended if it ended at all yeah when did you  start getting the shakes from not fucking sexting oh man he loves it oh boy does he love talking 
[00:28:30]  about his cock he's uh he's addicted period dick i completely understand this guy i get it it's like  and so many people do it's not hard to understand how you get caught in this i just can't then run  from heger sorry exactly just admit that look maybe it's not the right time but jimmy you nailed  it it's the arrogance about the whole fucking thing you're right yeah you're right he's standing  up there like we're all dumb like right you're right like uh he's almost annoyed he has to do his 
[00:29:00]  press conference look i told you i told you there might be more out there yeah i thought i explained  myself yeah hey i think he throws an i think out out there questions for all right jesus everything  out perfectly yeah for everybody here you think spitzer's happy about this though because it takes  the heat off him like hey i stopped we got two guys no more whores in my uh past find another  prostitute yeah go ahead i dare you oh but you know he's jonesing behind closed doors he shakes

[00:32:30]  everything that upon myself um i am i'm prepared not to dispute anything that is out there but  suffice it to say that people are out there saying things that that are that i i that are are  not true what else is out there but that's not the point what else is out there can we hear that  fucking poignant shouted question right i studied uh body language a little bit this guy is looking 
[00:33:00]  down this guy is a lying piece of you think so yes that's a huge tell when you can't look uh look at  the person asking you a question when you start looking down like that that's that's a basic one  to be honest with you that's just basic body language do you think he's wishing this didn't happen  oh sure but i can just go away go do something else write a book write a whatever anthony wiener  i love jerking off i love jacking up this there's obviously a lot of stuff out there 
[00:33:30]  could you hear that question how that was shout that was so perfectly timed and shouted what else is  out there right he's like oh boy but suffice it to say that people are out there saying things  that that that are that i i that are are are not true what else is out there but that's not the  point that's not the point i accept the responsibility for having these conversations with these people 
[00:34:00]  who i never met with exchanging inappropriate things in the context of of our marriage and that  was a mistake and i bear responsibility he's looking up again that is behind me and we're trying to move  forward and we are recognized it's not going to be easy you better recognize the moment we got into  this grace that it wasn't going to be easy but i believe this is an important thing to be doing  thank you all very much  i'm going to go in the back now and get screamed at again  yeah oh man you fucking owe me big time you condescending cocksucker yeah yeah she i bet you

[00:39:30]  be in i'm i'm an entertainer it has nothing to do with my personal oh good for kenny i mean carlos  danger do you need to do your script yeah yeah so playing the part of carlos uh danger which obviously  is the elias for anthony weiner yes will be club soda can into the mark uh mike cd and uh what do we  know about the gal where's she from how old is she he was kind of promising her condo she's 22 
[00:40:00]  um i don't know how he met her probably online facebook or whatever well she's pretty hot yeah  she's pretty i'm happy that they showed a real face though because if you're gonna out public  figures like this fuck you you don't deserve privacy well it was uh a website that figured  it out it wasn't yeah it wasn't like the news going well let's just well she's in the paper though  yeah yeah wait how did this come about i don't know i'm not sure i know buzzfeed they're saying

[01:07:00]  their cell phones who don't realize the implications that it's forever it's forever and it's over  ever and it goes everywhere so geraldo uh did the selfie over the weekend to show everyone that 70  looks good he said 70 is the new 50. look out so he was rocking it in front of the mirror with  barely covering his dick and balls with a towel everything else was showing except just his dick 
[01:07:30]  and that's what bothers me the most about his selfie because he thought about the towel placement  yeah for a while and decided okay if i if i keep it this low he says it was strategically placed oh  he does say well of course it is so uh yeah i didn't even know geraldo had a radio show yeah  where is his radio show to me i don't know i think it's like online oh some kind of like  uh podcast thing or something and he has to shave down like sure it would be a big disaster of  fucking hair there well look at the mustache you gotta assume yeah he's got gray hair a lot of 
[01:08:00]  fucking hair this god right so geraldo explains the selfie photo on his radio show while on the phone  with elliot spitzer oh elliot spitzer doesn't want to deal with this shit yeah he kind of keeps quiet  of course he does you're not gonna hear anything from him and tv personality eric uh bowling who's he  do we know him i don't know but he's the one that kind of uh he falls over a lot started this  oh jeez oh oh it's this dude what's his name oh yeah oh yeah he's in the gutter oh he's from the 
[01:08:30]  five on fox yeah the five yeah the vay and the fave so uh eric what what did you think when you when  you saw it and you do you think i still have a job i think you still have a job i'm guessing  um i well here's what i thought i tweeted immediately uh what dot dot dot dot question  mark and then why question mark question um beep beep beep or although uh yeah i mean of all the 
[01:09:00]  people you should know better i mean it would be you look what look at this look what's going on  with anthony weiner if you know everything about what's going on with anthony weiner what were you  thinking my man you're a friend what were you thinking remember i stayed above my private parts  with my i had a strategically placed uh towel there but you know uh governor elliott spitzer  speaks of the governor speaks of hubris hubris is when you make when you make the churn life 
[01:09:30]  for boredom or for uh ambition or you just can't stand to have things uh organized and quiet and you  you kind of you create a tumult uh in your in your life and and i think that there i was  2 30 in the morning on on sunday morning and you know i do the show saturday night i did a great show  on uh you know black on black crime and race relations and the trayvon martin fallout and federal 
[01:10:00]  charges going on these crimes in boston and uh you know the death of a witness in fbi custody so i did  that show and i get there and i get home and i'm on and there's no one to talk to everyone's asleep  and you just sit around i i had a drink and then i was uh you know i had taken that picture saturday  morning and i was looking and i just going through and i i said you know i gotta i gotta tweet this  thing i look pretty good for a 70 year old and i think because i'm so old people will cut me some slack 
[01:10:30]  uh you know that they won't they won't take it too seriously and i don't know i just pushed the  trigger and then once you push the trigger it's there for life it's there for life i don't have  any problem with it just not at all you know you just picture him sitting there half your drinks laugh  fuck it i bet i could get some pussy by putting this picture out fuck it so he was just kind of 
[01:11:00]  hanging out with his rose colored glasses yeah you probably thought a bunch of people were going  to comment on how nice his body was yeah and he didn't realize because he was drunk yes he didn't  realize it's one of those ideas you have at night and then you wake up in the morning and that's when  you realize it's a bad idea yeah yeah but he actually did it i thank god i don't drink in the age of  cell phones oh my god what the fuck it's only a cock everybody has one i could imagine holy look at 
[01:11:30]  jimmy's eyes rolling yeah oh he would be a problem dude i would i can't imagine the things that would  be going out of my twitter oh my god dude how close is is he to the top of his fucking penis there  really like real close right that's what's weird about this the picture well he wanted to really  show up he really likes that v of his huh every bit of it you gotta have the point in the v or it's 
[01:12:00]  not a v so you really got to move that towel down plus he knows the girls like that that's just such  a tease like oh all i want to do is rip that towel down god is he married these days i know he like  that comes and goes with him i think he was a pussy hound at one point yeah don't kid him man  fuck everyone you just lose muscle mass at that age like look at his shoulders and stuff and his  arms it's like it doesn't matter what you do but he's 70 that's what i mean but you know all right 
[01:12:30]  but if you turn around his ass would be completely exposed that's how low the towel was for you and  your fantasies yeah you see that it says he's married it says he's been married since 2003  why wasn't his wife hanging around why was he so lonely that he had to take photos of his  they were sleeping he said it they were sleeping haroldo was lonely  he was lonely damn well man this first hour and a half of this show exhausted me it's exhausting 
[01:13:00]  between the anthony and carlos danger and the haraldo thing and the readings my dick hasn't gone down  once yet you gotta wonder what politicians in the past uh would have tripped over their own dicks on  cell phones and everything kennedy's probably would have done something oh my god he would have been  all over the kennedy's send me a picture of your cunt mimi oh immediately mimi beardsley dearest mimi 
[01:13:30]  uh even clinton imagine if clinton had a cell phone yeah yeah what what i think he sent one email when he's  in the white house that's right yeah there's one email there's a cockpit yes this big cockpit  what was the one email he sent i want to bang you so hard that your tits smack off your face  he was smart enough though although he did come on that dress and even smart people get caught up in  this right wiener's a smart guy but man when you're pumping your dick brains don't mean anything

Yes I am  What are you going to do in Montreal?  Here you go  Probably eat  Oh  Try some of their food  There's some great restaurants I'm hearing stuff about  I want to go out tonight  What kind of restaurants?  Well, the one Roland's been telling everybody about  Is called Joe Beef  And apparently they have a great food cuisine there 
[01:28:00]  That's what he told me yesterday  He goes  Food cuisine  Are you making reservations?  He's talking about restaurants all day  And I go, I don't know  I'm going to go to Montreal and just see what happens  Because we've got to figure out our radio shows still  He's like me with fucking Backpage.com  Right  The way he looks at restaurants  He's like, I look up hookers and shit  Wow  Like I've been thinking about dinners  And he goes, well Joe Beef is up there  Oh, but they don't have the food cuisine that you like  Food cuisine  They go, what?  It's either the food or the cuisine  Food cuisine  Why don't we get rolling in here? 
[01:28:30]  To talk about food cuisine?  Yeah, because he's figuring out our food plans  Food cuisine plans  For the big Montreal trip  And we're broadcasting tomorrow and Friday  7 to 11  From the Hyatt  I don't know what street it's on  But it's right there  It's right in the middle of the Just for Laughs festival  The Hyatt Regency, right?  A lot of guests lined up  A lot of comedians coming on  Boy do we  And then we're doing that Friday night surprise show  Which they say is sold out  But who knows  There may be tickets at the door available  I don't know  So if you want to try to get tickets  You know, walk up never hurts  Sold out  That's pretty cool, huh?  Yeah 
[01:29:00]  He's coming in with our itinerary  Roland, what do you got for us?  Where should we eat?  As far as food cuisine goes  Yes  Well, there's a  I forgot  But there's a sandwich place that has like a smoked meats  That you can get over here  Yeah  So I'm going to sit there  Why can't we get smoked meat over here?  They perfected it over there though  They're the French  So I'm going to sit there  But why don't we send a spa and go  Oh, that's how you do the smoked meat  And then bring it back to the States  Do they smoke the toast steak? 
[01:29:30]  I don't know  Yeah, what?  They're smoking it like it's a bunch of cigars or something  So after the show  I'm going to skedaddle and enjoy a couple of course meals there  Enjoy the meats  Oh  A little nap  Are you going to eat some beaver?  I'll eat whatever  They eat beaver up there, man  Do they?  Yeah, they do  There's an animal  I'll eat it  Maybe they have donkey over there  Were you really looking up restaurants and stuff in Montreal?  Of course he was  Yeah  Yeah  I was going to occur to me to do that  He's a foodie  Yeah  He gets so bummed out though  Like when we went to Cleveland 
[01:30:00]  Yeah  He had all this stuff planned out  But he didn't  Like he's the worst traveler of anyone on the staff by far  It's just terrible with timing and booking his flights  Oh no  And all that stuff  So he had no idea what kind of time he had  And when he found out that we only had time to eat in the food court at the mall  before the show in Cleveland  Oh God  He couldn't have been more depressed  Yeah, that's bad  It was  He sampled the court though  He texted me yesterday  Sampled  He texted me yesterday  And he says  Are you bringing a carry-on for tomorrow? 
[01:30:30]  I go, yeah, of course  Just bring a carry-on  And he came in today  He's got a messenger bag with all his clothes shoved in it  A messenger bag  People didn't realize you could have a real bag as a carry-on  Yeah  My bad  My bad  A smaller suitcase  What's a messenger bag?  It's  It's like a book bag  Like over the shoulder  Is that nothing?  Oh, that's funny  It's like a laptop case  Like you could take one of those  That's a carry-on  Yeah  Colin's kinda like a child when he's traveling  100%  Oh no 
[01:31:00]  He's the worst independent traveler I've ever seen  The stewardess is gonna give him little wings  Lashes  Just sit on the captain's lap  Yeah  When we went to Chicago  He was on a different flight than everybody  And he's texting me  Oh, these cheap fucks at Sirius  They got me on this tiny little plane  I don't believe this  And I texted him back and said  Roland  We all booked our own flights  Oh  And he went  Oh, my bad  Oh my god  And plus the price doesn't change on a smaller plane 
[01:31:30]  No  Like an Embraer  It's the route you're paying for  Not the fucking size of the plane  And it was Roland that booked it anyway  Sirius had nothing to do with it  The deli that Roland's referring to, by the way, is Schwartz's  Yeah  But what is that?  What's this?  Huh?  They're known for their sandwiches  For their smoked meat, yeah  It's amazing  Is it good?  It's phenomenal  Maybe if everyone's lucky I'll have a sandwich there  It's the best here  What kind of smoked meat?  Sandwiches  Smoked meat sandwiches  On rye bread and mustard  That's probably very good  Yeah  Alright, you convinced me  It's delicious, yeah  Roland asked us yesterday 
[01:32:00]  I am not a food guy  No, I'm not  Really  If the food's good  I'm like, oh, that's really good  But I won't go out of my way like, oh, that's a great restaurant  I'm just as happy getting room service  I don't give a shit  What?  I'd rather just do that and save the time for drinking  We could do that 24 hours a day  Thank you, Kenny  Hi Kenny  Thank you  Thanks for reiterating that  How big is the pool?  How big is the pool?  It's a salt water lap pool  Ooh  Wait, a lap pool?  Yeah  Can you swim naked?  Isn't that like a skinny pool? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah  Yeah  No, it's good  No, it's a skinny pool  I gotta buy a bathing suit  I don't want no skinny pool  I want a fat pool  And Roland, they are small planes again  And you're sitting next to Troy  Poor Troy  Why not poor Roland?  Yeah  Because Roland's husky  But in the plane though, the fat guy always wins  Well  Cause he's got blob 
[01:33:00]  Yeah  Fucking Roland  You don't, you don't, uh, you don't, like, seep over the armrests  No, no, but I will take two shits on the plane  Don't shit on the plane  We're not flying for hours  It's a one hour flight  I know  I'm saving it right now  I'm holding it  Why would you do that?  That'd be hilarious  Please don't flush  I'm holding it  And I get the door open  I go, does anybody else have to go?  Oh, no  Oh, no  It's just the worst  He came in during the break  Don't flush either  And he does  He goes  Oh, I'm gonna have to shit so bad on the plane 
[01:33:30]  We're leaving like six or seven hours  Yeah  I'm holding it  So much time to shit before  You don't just shit now  No, I'm gonna hold it till it hurts  We got people that are gonna help us out with mushroom  Oh  Rich in Buffalo  Rich  Hello, fellas  Actually, I'm originally from Long Island  But I moved up here  But anyway, I went to Montreal last summer on a vacation  I had the smoked meat  It's basically a corned beef sandwich that you can get in any kosher deli 
[01:34:00]  You know, but it is really good  But so is every good corned beef sandwich I've had in a kosher deli  Exactly  Thank you  That's right though  But they have fantastic croissants  Not crow nuts or whatever the hell they're called  The ones I had were like fresh out of the oven  I mean, it was the best thing I ever ate  And you guys were talking about raccoons yesterday  And there's this Mount Royale  Which is how Montreal got its name  Travis backed me up on this  But if you go follow the road up to Mount Royale 
[01:34:30]  To the scenic vista or whatever  And on the way up  Little mountain  Mount Royale  Montreal  Hold on a second  Let's confirm with Travis  That that's the origin  Good old Travis  Go ahead Trav  Back him up  Correct  Or rebuke him  I can't wait for the call  This fucking guy from Bubble  You don't know what the fuck he's talking about  And then so on the way up to the  I guess to the peak  Where you can go and oversee the city  There's a little scenic vista you can pull in  And there's giant signs 
[01:35:00]  Do not feed the raccoons  But of course everybody does  And they are the friendliest  Where's this going  We could feed raccoons  He's talking about friendly sweet Canadian raccoons  They're friendly  It went from food  Yeah  They're friendly because you have food  Can you pet them?  I would not  I would never pet a raccoon  Jimmy  Yeah  Hold on  I don't know about that  Travis back him up  Are they friendly or not?  You know Jim 
[01:35:30]  Travis will back him up  I can't confirm  You've never gone to the top of Montreal  Well I have  But I've never gone to the raccoon meetup  Oh  Yeah  What about Beaver?  No thanks  No man  Fucking  On Piers Morgan's show  He did a whole thing from Montreal  And they ate beaver  Nice  Piers Morgan?  I'm not Piers Morgan  Fucking Anthony Bourdain  Jesus  Oh man  Yeah that's a big difference  Anthony Bourdain did a whole thing  And they ate beaver  And they ate beaver  And donkey 
[01:36:00]  And I didn't  Did they eat donkey too?  Yeah in an Indian restaurant  Yes  Oh  They didn't know it was donkey  They thought it was chicken  Alright  Thanks for this amazing phone call  How did Don get back in his house?  Yeah fucking donkey  Because they're eating it  Oh yeah  Wordplay humor  It's the best kind of humor  It's very very sophisticated  Sophisticated 
[01:36:30]  Roland yesterday was trying to get ideas from us  As to what to do  While we're up there  And he asked Sam and I  If it's worth it to take the boat to Quebec  Oh my god  Is that a long boat ride?  No  Roland doesn't understand that Montreal  Is in the province of Quebec  Oh I see  Yes  Take a boat to Montreal  Have to drag it fucking 1600 miles  That would be like taking a boat from  Manhattan to New York  Gotcha  Yeah yeah  Any boat you get out of New York  Gotcha  From Manhattan  All boats in Montreal 
[01:37:00]  Are already in Quebec  Quebec City though?  They're not in Quebec City  I think that's what he meant  Quebec as Alex Trebek says  Quebec  That's how it's pronounced  In Montreal  Just say Montreal  You're going to be so annoyed when you're up there  Why?  No  I'm not really going to see many people  You'll be in the casino  Well that's true  Where is the casino?  They'll be counting in France  From Montreal  How far is that from where we're going to be?  I have no idea  Kenny?  Any clue?  Not far  Keith knows  10 minutes 
[01:37:30]  Drive maybe 15  Are you going today or tomorrow?  Probably tomorrow  Do you know how to count in French?  Yes  That's what they'll be doing  Yes  When you're playing blackjack  One  Two  Yeah  Oh yeah  What is it?  What is it?  That's ten  Nice  Two  Two  Oh that's  Sometimes it's tough  That's France of fucking the forties  You know how fast they count in casinos here  And when you're trying to keep up with numbers that you're not used to hearing 
[01:38:00]  Nah I just look at the cards  Exactly  I know what I got  He knows how to add  I've gotten pretty good at that  Why don't we say hi to Jeff in Montreal  Hey this is Jeff from Montreal  What's up Jeff?  What do you got?

He's always gotta push it to there  With the bitches  I have a fantasy of watching a Spike Lee movie with Ant  I don't see that happening either  Someone's saying there's more strip clubs than stores in Montreal  There's a lot of strip clubs  A lot of strip clubs  Most Toronto has a lot too  It's just overrated  They are overrated  The one I went to in Toronto stunk  It was fucking  They have all these pictures of these like American looking girls  On the outside of the club  All Asians  And it's totally nude  And it's like totally nude 
[01:50:30]  And you walk in  They're all Asian  They're all Asian  And they're not totally nude  Most of them are the dancers that just dance around  They got the bottoms on  And then the featured dancer comes out  She dances with bottoms on  At the very end  She takes the bottoms off  And moves around a little and then leaves  That's your whole bottomless  Stinks  It was terrible  I was sitting there going this is  I feel like I'm in fucking Saigon  When I worked in Buffalo  We went to a Toronto strip club  And the program director 
[01:51:00]  We got pussy juice on his glasses  Sounds wonderful  The girl put it back on his head  And we just all laughed and laughed  Yeah?  Thought it was hilarious  You saw it like on his glasses?  She was dancing  And then took his glasses  And smeared her juice all over him  Let's do that to Gary  Jesus  Yes  Is Gary coming?  Oh yeah  Oh boy  Gary Bear is gonna be in the house  I'm glad he's coming  And not the interns  Wow  Oh you're right  We've had fun if Jackie and Sydney were going 
[01:51:30]  Jack Hay  Jack Hay  Alright well the big trip is going down in a couple hours  But we gotta take a break  Joe Rogan's gonna be on the phone next  Oh  To talk about his new show  That's getting good reviews  Yes  Very happy for Joe Rogan  So up his alley  Absolutely  The O.B. and Anthony Show  O.A. O.A. O.A.  On Sirius XM  O.A. O.A.  The O.B. and Anthony Show  Continues 
[01:52:00]  We're back already  And we got Joe Rogan on the phone  What's up Joe?  Hello boys  Joe  What's happening?  What the fuck?  Well we're getting ready to go to Montreal, Canada  We're broadcasting live tomorrow and Friday 
[01:52:30]  The first time that we're broadcasting outside of America  Oh that's beautiful  The Just for Laughs thing  Yeah  We finally after all these years decided to do it  It's a fun time  You know it's a fun hang  Yeah  The best thing about it is how many comics are up there  It's a good time  Yeah definitely looking forward to it  Absolutely  And we just learned about beaver tail  And you can make bacon out of beaver tail 
[01:53:00]  Some guy was trying to turn us on to that  Oh that's crazy  That's not going to taste good  And the guy said you've got to slice it thick  Yeah  And we've just been talking about it during the break  How just disgusting that sounds  Sounds putrid  But he's trying to say no man  It tastes just like bacon  But I don't think  I don't think  I don't think we're going to gross Joe out with anything  Well that's why I'm bringing it up  That's why I'm bringing it up  That's  There's a connection here  To you know  Fucking weird shit  That beats seeing some bad stuff  I understand  Yeah I know a guy who ate beaver tail 
[01:53:30]  Steve Rinella  He used to have this show on the travel channel called The Wild Within  And it was all about like  He would do the same thing that Lewis and Clark did  When they like travel across the country  And like shoot animals and make boats out of moose hides and shit  Yeah  And he ate a beaver tail and it did not look good  Oh god no  It looked like a last ditch effort to stay alive sort of a thing  Yeah yeah  It seems like it'll be grisly and fucking  Yeah 
[01:54:00]  It's all fat  Yeah  Yeah  Like bacon  The beautiful thing about bacon is  It's fat but there's also some meat  And that meat happens to be pork  Yeah  You know  Like it's not a fucking rat  A giant fatty rat with a big stupid fish tail  A big flat tail  It's a disgusting animal  They really are  What do you think of that report about fish oil causing prostate cancer?  That's a very interesting report  The problem is it's only one report 
[01:54:30]  These days it's really difficult to find out who's right and who's retarded  Right  You know because there's so many goddamn reports these days  Yeah  And they're so conflicting  Like stuff that's supposed to be really really good for you turns out to be killing people  So it's like I don't know who the fuck is right  I use fish oil on a daily basis  You do right?  All the time  It's so important for inflammation  For inflammation for like for jujitsu  And like things that cause a lot of inflammation from exercise 
[01:55:00]  Like knees and your elbows and your back  Fish oil is a miracle cure  I try to read for my inflammation  Yeah motherfucker  Oh God  Joe I think you found the perfect fucking show by the way  Yes  I'm really happy for you  Oh thank you  Thank you very much  And we're getting good reviews here in New York for the show  Oh really?  Yeah yeah absolutely  It's called Joe Rogan Questions Everything  Premiering on Syfy tonight at 10  Yeah I hope it turns out good 
[01:55:30]  I mean I spent a lot of time working on it  It's really kind of stupid to have another gig  I have too much going on at this point in time  It's really  I don't even know how the hell I did it  Now what's the whole gist of the show?  What's the gist of the show?  The gist of the show is  Well it's sort of an extension of what I already do on the podcast  And the podcast is actually in every episode  The idea is I go out and like the first episode is about Bigfoot 
[01:56:00]  I've been an idiot obsessed with Bigfoot since I was a little kid  So I actually go out, me and my pal Duncan Trussell  Actually go out to the woods in the Pacific Northwest  We go looking for Bigfoot  We stayed out there  We went with professional Bigfoot hunters  We met with them  We looked at the evidence they gathered  We took their evidence and brought it to geneticists  And I mean we really tried to treat it as if  Yeah you went deep on this one  We went super deep  We went full retard  It was really fun 
[01:56:30]  But the experts, were they a little strange?  Some yes and some no  Really?  It's like what you find when you're looking for Bigfoot  Here's what you don't find  Black dudes  Okay?  It's all the same thing  It's all these unfuckable white guys in the latter half of their life  Yeah  That's what you're finding  You're finding dudes who are crossed over past the great divide of 40X whatever 
[01:57:00]  And they're not getting any pussy whatsoever  So they're like, you know what?  Fuck this  Somebody go looking for Bigfoot  That's what I've always wanted to do  And so they go wandering through the woods  Looking, you know, knocking on trees  They have all these things that they do like they believe  There's, first of all, almost no evidence of Bigfoot  I know, that's just it, yeah  And you find that out along the way  The best evidence is footprints  That's the best evidence  Yeah, plenty of footprints around  But no bones, no piece of hide somewhere or tools or any of this shit 
[01:57:30]  Or a hat or a text message that one of them sends  Yeah, it's an interesting subject  What's really interesting is that there used to be a real live Bigfoot  Yeah  The animal itself absolutely used to exist as recently as 100,000 years ago  It was called Gigantopithecus  And they found out about it in the 1920s at an apothecary shop in China 
[01:58:00]  There's a guy who was an anthropologist  Who was searching through a pile of bones  And he found this gigantic primate tooth  That he knew wasn't a gorilla  He knew wasn't a human being  And he was like, what the fuck is this?  And he asked the people  And they said they knew where they found it  So they went to this particular area  They found more bones  Including a jawbone  And they found through the design of the jawbone  That this was an animal that was a bipedal animal  So it stood on two legs  And it was between eight and ten feet tall  It was a gigantic, huge, gorilla-looking thing 
[01:58:30]  And so, you know, it led them to this discovery of this animal  That absolutely existed  And as I said, the most recent bone was 100,000 years ago  So the theory for the Bigfoot is  That this animal came along the Bering Strait  The same way people did  Right  Into North America  And the Pacific Northwest is so lush with life and plant life  That they decided to stay up there 
[01:59:00]  It is fucking freaky up there, I'll tell you that  When you go up in the Pacific Northwest  The amount of just completely undiscovered territory  Yeah  It's massive  You walk around and just think like  I am the first person to step here  If not ever in a very long time  Yeah, when you fly over it  All the way from Alaska  All the way down to Northern California  That's where all the sightings are  Yeah  It's really strange  You know, and like I said  It could most likely be 100% bullshit 
[01:59:30]  But it's also a real animal  I mean, it was real  You know, it's like someone saying  That we've been seeing a brontosaurus in the Congo  For the past, you know, 100 years  And you gotta go  Well, there used to be a brontosaurus  It's not likely  This is way, way, way more likely than that  Because this animal lived 100,000 years ago for a fact  100%  How far in the woods did you go?  Oh, we went deep  We were fucking  It was freaky, man 
[02:00:00]  Well, that's what I was gonna ask you  How freaky  Mount Rainier  We went to Mount Rainier  Which really freaky is  Yeah  And people who live up there in the woods  Have seen these fucking things  Like not just like one  But like half the people  And some of them will tell you stories  Like normal people who didn't wanna be on camera  Normal people who had regular jobs  Who weren't crazy  And they're like  I don't give a fuck what anybody says  I saw it  I saw it  It was chasing after an elk  It was gigantic  I was about six miles in 
[02:00:30]  We were camping  And we saw this fucking thing  I saw it for two seconds  It was as crazy as two seconds of my life  It was a hundred yards away  It stepped between these two trees  I saw a giant gorilla  And I shit my pants  And I've never been the same  Wow  It's really weird, man  And they don't wanna go on camera  Some of them don't wanna go on camera  Interesting  Some of them do  And people were crying  We had a guy  This fucking guy was telling us a story  He starts crying  Oh, pissy eyes  Yeah, how  Shit is sad  Yeah, get a hold of yourself  Jesus Christ 
[02:01:00]  Get a hold of yourself  Just the missing link, sir  Relax  Yeah, relax, sir  Why fucking it?  Well, that's  By the way, Jim  It's funny that you said that  Because that's  One of the primary theories  When it comes to  The genetics of this animal  Is that they think  That it's a hybrid  They think it's  At some point in time  Like one of the ancient relatives of man  Had sex with  Whatever the fuck this thing is  Jesus  And that's why it's so smart  But how does it  But even how would it reproduce  One guy could just do that  And create a new species? 
[02:01:30]  One girl  It has been done  Some hybrids are fertile  It depends on how close the genome is, apparently  Yeah, yeah, you need like the  Equal number of chromosomes or some shit  Yeah, some  In the reproductive cells  Some animals  Some hybrids, actually  I mean, that is actually how some hybrids become a new species  I don't know  Look, I'm not convinced that it's real  But I'm not convinced it's not real either  Well, we got a guy from Seattle 
[02:02:00]  Agrees that Bigfoot is out there  That's the area  See, Seattle  Right  Washington State has the highest amount of sightings  And that area around Mount Rainier  Has the highest amount of sightings in Washington State  In fact, the names of all these hills and valleys  All of them  Like, there's a giant amount of them  That are all named after an ancient Indian word for Bigfoot  Bigfoot  Oh my god, yeah  Is there a mash-up Nicole Mountain?  Yeah  She's got huge feet 
[02:02:30]  Let me put Matt on with Joe Rogan  Matt in Seattle  Go ahead  Hi Joe  Yeah, I live like 25 miles out of Seattle  And I hike all the time  And yeah, there's some shit out there, dude  Like, I'm totally with you  But Matt, have you seen anything?  You can't just  I don't know, I've seen like foot  I've seen markings on trees that are not like human or animalistic 
[02:03:00]  Like they're, that's some next level shit  Well, one of the weird things they find in trees  Alright, Matt  Thank you for the worst contribution possible  Thank you  Scientific  By the way, that's the kind of guy that's out there looking for Bigfoot  Sure  They weren't human or animal  That doesn't help us  That's some shit, man  It's impossible to do, man  Right  One of the things you find is tree branches  That are, like trees  That are snapped off like eight to ten feet up  Instead of like at the bottom 
[02:03:30]  Like if you were pulling on a tree where it would snap  You see a tree like snapped in half  And you're like, well, how the fuck did that happen?  And no one knows  It's a live tree, it's not a dry tree  And these things get snapped  Like, and also you see trees that are like stacked in these weird ways  And we found some of that deep in the woods  It's very fucking bizarre  It's very bizarre when you realize that you're talking about thousands of square miles 
[02:04:00]  Of just like, you know how you open up a box of q-tips and you see how many q-tips are in there?  That's what the fucking trees are like up there  Because it's raining constantly  It fucking never stops raining  So when you're walking through the woods, you don't make any noises  Because below you are five to six feet of pine needles and leaves  Just massed down and compressed  So everything is like this big smooshy cushion everywhere you go 
[02:04:30]  It's really fucking freaky up there, man  Is it five feet of pines? Wow, Jesus  Pine needles  Needles and leaves and shit that falls from the trees  Because there's so much vegetation  It's really like one of the weirdest places I've ever been  It's like a completely different dimension  Did you go into the whole rainforest?  Oh yeah, we went deep in there  I hiked the whole rainforest  But I mean, it was more like a day hike  But still, the amount of different shades of green you see as you're walking through the rainforest is amazing 
[02:05:00]  And then you see huge trees that are easily 200 years old  Growing out of a tree that fell down  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You saw all that shit, right?  And you realize, holy fuck, we're so insignificant  Yeah  Our time on this earth is nothing  Yeah, when you go 200 years ago  And you think about how ridiculous that is  You're talking about 200 years ago  It's like nothing  Right  That's the blink of an eye  And there wasn't even anybody here 
[02:05:30]  People were just getting here  And the fucking stupid wagons with wooden wheels  They're like, we made it!  Yeah, these trees are so wide  I can't even  You have to see it for yourself  And then, you know, that tree fell  Then a little seedling gets in it  And then a huge mass of tree grows out of it  Well, have you ever seen the redwood trees where they cut holes in them?  Oh yeah  And you drive cars through them?  Yeah, that's crazy  Drive cars through the bottom of a tree  Yeah  Did you camp out there?  The redwoods  Did you just go in and out in the same day? 
[02:06:00]  Well, we  Duncan and I stayed at a hotel  We were smart  We went to Bear Grylls style  Yeah  We figured, look, we're gonna be there till late at night  And then we'll sleep for a few hours in a hotel  And then get back there in the morning  Like, why the fuck do we have to sleep on the ground  Out there like an asshole in a big cloth house?  I mean, there's a lot of real shit to worry about out there  Like mountain lions  Like, they're legit  I mean, there's plenty of food for them  Like, they probably wouldn't attack a person  Because there's so much elk up there to eat 
[02:06:30]  Like, everywhere you go  You're stepping in elk shit  Oh, really?  You see, we saw elk everywhere  I saw elk  They're massive  Big wild cows  Yeah  They're fucking massive  Huge  They're everywhere  They're huge, right  Yeah  They're everywhere and they make weird noises  Yep  They make all whistles  It's very strange  Did you pet any?  Ha ha  I'm with my cock, Jim  I would love to pet an elk  I don't think they would let you  They would stomp you to death  Oh, would they really?  They're violent  They're very angry 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  They're massively charged with testosterone  Yeah, they're nasty  Jeff New Hampshire  Why do you never find Bigfoot skeletons?  We kind of went over that  Okay, well, why do you never find bear skeletons?  There's a lot of bear  In fact, thousands  But finding a dead bear is extremely rare  Finding a mountain lion, a dead mountain lion, even more rare  Real animals that we absolutely know about  You very rarely find dead  The only thing you find dead on a regular basis is like deer that have been hit by cars  And things along those lines  You find those 
[02:07:30]  But you very, very rarely find known animals dead in the woods  Because it takes only a short amount of time for things to go after them and devour them  Like if you leave a dead animal on the ground in the woods where all these rodents and coyotes and all these different animals live  They eat that fucking thing down to nothing in no time  Even the bones  Yeah, nature has a really efficient way of getting rid of things  But the thing about sasquatch, if it was a real animal, the suspicion is that they bury their dead 
[02:08:00]  So they have little burial forms that no one ever sees  Well, when you figure a couple of hundred years, if you look at it like that  Like we've been on the west for 300 years  That's not like we've been there for 5,000 years  That's not that long a period of time where you wouldn't find something  No  Something could exist that we don't find in 300 years  That's not that crazy  Well, especially when you go there and you realize what you're dealing with  I had never been, so I didn't really know what it was like up there  But when you go up there and you're walking through those woods 
[02:08:30]  You're like, oh, no, there could fucking be anything up here  There could be almost anything up there  You see eagles  You see all kinds of freaky shit up there  Wow, and this is the first episode of  Yeah, that's the first  Yeah, one of my favorite subjects ever  That's the first one  And then we went  There was a bunch of different episodes  We went to New York  We went to this transhumanist episode  Where it's all these people that want to live forever  Download their consciousness into computers 
[02:09:00]  And they have robot parts  And very fucking freaky shit  That was interesting, too  That's Ray Kurzweil, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we talked to him  We had him on  He's a bit of a bore, but he's highly intelligent, I'll tell you  Yeah, he's not the most excitable guy in the world  But his concepts are pretty interesting  Well, he's predicted, he's more accurate as far as his predictions for future technology than anyone in human history  Did you see his, oh, sorry, sorry, Joe, go  No, I was just going to say, and he has a bunch of inventions that he's invented himself 
[02:09:30]  I mean, he's the guy responsible for speech-to-text  When you talk into your phone and Siri answers questions for you, that's because of Kurzweil  Did you see the documentary on him?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  Did you see the part about the robots, where the people working with the robots are scared shitless of the actual technology behind it?  And they're basically saying, we've got to shut down the program  Oh, man  They talked to these guys, I think it was Japan, it's been a few years now  But they were losing their minds, going, you don't understand  We are heading into a dangerous fucking place with this technology 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, that's the guy who calls them artilects  Yeah, yeah  Artificial intellects  Yeah, it's interesting  You know, the idea that they would have the same sort of instincts as us, though, is kind of silly  Because the only reason we have these instincts is because we were raised biologically  It's because natural selection forced us to, you know, the survival of the fittest  There won't be any of those instincts  All the things that make human beings so fucked up are that we come from chimpanzee DNA 
[02:10:30]  We come from this lineage of animals that we're hiding in trees from jaguars and fighting for the best mate  I mean, all that shit is the reason why jealousy exists and all these different emotions exist  It's all like, they're all methods for continuing the genome  But that won't exist in a robot  That's why there's debate  It's like, it's a completely uncharted area  Let me ask you, if that stuff's all true  Like, whatever it is that makes us us, like all those things you just said  Isn't there a way to break it down, eventually, once we have DNA mapped 
[02:11:00]  Into just pure chemicals, like this chemical causes that and that chemical causes this  So if it's broken down into a chemical thing, a formula can be figured out for it  Which would make these, like, weird things that feel intangible in us  Not feel so random or weird at all  Sure  Which is where a robot might be able to  That's why I kind of believe Kurzweil when he talks about uploading us to hard drives  Because once we're broken down into the most basic figureoutable formula, that might be possible 
[02:11:30]  It might be, or you know what else might be possible?  What might be possible is that we're not even really here  And that's where it gets really strange  When you start getting into the concept of virtual reality  When you get into the concept of the absolute undeniable fact  That there's going to come a point in time where you're able to create an artificial reality  That is indiscernible from this reality  You can bang on it  You can pick things up  You can fuck  You can get shot in it 
[02:12:00]  You can die in a car crash  All the different things that can happen to you in this life  Can happen to you in a simulated environment  That's, without a doubt, it's inevitable  It's coming  Whether it's ten years from now or a hundred years from now  They're going to be able to plug you into a virtual reality  That you're not going to be able to tell  And then comes the answer, or the question rather  Is it now?  Has it already happened and you don't know?  Wow  If it is, there is an artificial reality  If you are in a simulated environment  And it's so good that you can't tell the difference 
[02:12:30]  How do you know if you're in it right now?  Wow  That might be the future  That's what a lot of these guys are saying  They're saying  It's not going to be a physical future  Where you can, you know  All of a sudden you're going to have robot feet  And they're saying  Meh, maybe that'll be a little while  But after that  What gets really weird is the virtual world  The virtual world is going to be indiscernible  You're going to have no reason to go out there and become a fireman  Because you could just put on a helmet and be a fireman  You know, there's going to be no reason to be an Olympic athlete 
[02:13:00]  You could be an Olympic athlete  You could program all those parameters into your brain  And program it all into your artificial world that you live in  Like the real world of living in a world where  You know, you actually have to go dig a ditch and plant a tree  That might not exist in the future  But then what goes on outside you?  Like who's programming the machines?  Exactly!  I'll do you one better  It gets even freakier than that  If you create an artificial environment  If you create a simulation 
[02:13:30]  And inside of that simulation you have real people  That don't know they're in a simulation  And they continue on their lives the same way we are right now  And inside that simulation they create their own simulation  Then simulations become fractal  Just like the whole rest of the universe  If you look at the whole universe inside of every atom  The way it is, it's very much like the universe itself  There's a massive amount of space in between the actual objects  So the universe itself is like the inside of an atom 
[02:14:00]  The smaller you get, the more it mimics the biggest things that we know  That is odd  I've always thought, yeah, you look at an atom  And it's kind of like, you know, you've got your nucleus  Things rotating, spinning around it  It does resemble the solar systems and galaxies  Which all do the same thing  Yeah  Have you ever seen those photos of the universe in comparison to a brain cell?  No, does that look exactly the same too?  A human brain cell looks exactly like our version of the universe 
[02:14:30]  That's so fucked up  Wow  Yeah, like these photos  You can download, look it up on the internet  There's photos of them side by side  They're like identical  Like the universe literally might be a brain cell inside of another being  All right  Jesus  Yeah  That's not, maybe  It's just the fact that the universe exists itself  People are like, oh, that's too much  Just the fucking universe itself is too much  A hundred billion galaxies 
[02:15:00]  Each one with a supermassive black hole in the middle of it  It's one half of one percent of the mass of the galaxy  And if you go inside that black hole  You go into another universe  They believe that inside every black hole is in fact a whole nother world  A completely different universe  Filled with hundreds of billions of galaxies  Each one the same way with a supermassive black hole in it  And if you went into that, you'd go into a whole nother universe  Okay, that's, now that's fucked up 
[02:15:30]  It's fucking too much  Jesus  What in physics is it that, it's very small of us, it's like, you know, quantum physics  Where the molecules that were being observed behave differently than the molecules that weren't being observed  Do you know what I'm talking about that time?  Oh yeah, I saw that  Joe turned us onto that video  Oh, was it Joe who did? Okay  Yeah, absolutely  Yeah  What was that?  What gets really, it's the observer  The concept that when you measure particles and waves  When you measure them, they're different than when you don't measure them 
[02:16:00]  When you observe them, they behave more strangely and different than if you're not observing them  And I actually talked to this scientist from JPL two days ago about this  And he was trying to explain it to me, but I'm too fucking stupid to understand it exactly  But apparently there's a way to detect whether or not something is changing because of being measured  Or whether it's changing because someone is participating in watching it 
[02:16:30]  And when someone's participating, the results are different  When a person is watching it  Do we give off something when we watch that we don't know?  That's possible, yeah  But it's also possible that our own intent actually affects the quantum world around us  Like the woo-woo, Deepak Chopra shit  You know, you create your own environment  Your environment is a product of your consciousness  When they say that kind of shit and you're like  Okay, I don't even know what the fuck this guy is saying  There might be something to that  You may very well affect your environment by your presence 
[02:17:00]  Fuck  Yeah, that one really was freaky  There's just shit we don't know about  We'll never know  By the way, that's how dumbbells always wind up in a physics conversation  One goes, that's freaky  And the other one goes, there's a lot of shit we don't know about  We just don't know  We just don't know  Exactly  Exactly  Yeah  Joe, so this show's gonna be great, man  Joe Rogan questions everything  Premiering on Syfy tonight at 10 
[02:17:30]  Any other, quickly just run through some of the other topics  We can look forward to seeing on the show  We did a test with a bunch of people that are  Do you guys know what remote viewing is?  No  Yeah, I used to hear about it on Art Bell  Yeah, exactly  Art Bell's awesome  I love that show  But remote viewing is actually something that our own government  The CIA had a remote viewing program for almost 20 years  And what these people did was  They sat down and could tune in to an area in the world 
[02:18:00]  And draw with a certain degree of accuracy the various aspects of it  They could actually find out things that were going on in the world  And I met with this guy Ed Dames  Oh yeah  One of the head guys in this ancient remote viewing program  And he claims that they found Osama Bin Laden long before the government ever acted  And he believes that they didn't act because the government wanted to continue the war 
[02:18:30]  They actually didn't want to find Osama Bin Laden  It was a very interesting conversation  I used to hear him on Art Bell too  Does he offer any kind of like proof or data on that?  Because that almost sounds like a more political ideology that he's kind of espousing there  Yeah, you're right  No, no, when I asked him about like actual specific stuff  He's a very, he's a slippery guy  Yeah  There wasn't a lot there 
[02:19:00]  And I wonder how much of it is, you know, how much you can actually talk about  What's actually classified  But they apparently did find some Russian submarine that was unknown at the time and enormous  And had a very specific design that's different from any submarine that they had heard before  That had been built on American, on the American side before  I don't know though, I don't really  It seems, it's like all those things when people tell you about psychics  There's always an air of fuckery about it 
[02:19:30]  Like you hear the story and you go, okay, what, he knew about your grandmother  Yeah, I went to the psychic, he told me all about my grandmother  He told, and you go like, don't you know about your grandmother?  Right  Does anybody ever tell you some shit you don't know?  Because they always seem to tell you some shit that you already know  Right  Then I want to go  It's the only way it works, right?  I wish I was in that conversation, because you might be an idiot  That guy might be like a good con artist  And he might be posing questions in very leading ways 
[02:20:00]  And you might fall right into his traps  He might just be really good at getting you to give up information  How come you, why does the dead person always say something with love or  I'll miss you  How come the dead person never says anything stupid?  Right  Like what did my grandmother say?  She said my cunt itches  That's all she came out with  Well Terrence McKenna had a funny line about that  Where people were like channeling  And it was like, listen, just because you're dead doesn't mean you're smart  Right  Like you don't like just become smart all of a sudden when you die 
[02:20:30]  If you're dealing with a person who's like a reflection of who they were when they were alive  It's very likely you're talking to a dead idiot  Right  And the message is always vague  Oh yeah  Get the fuck out of here  Of course it's horse shit  I want specifics  It's like I said about the unfuckable white dudes  It all boils down to like the same sort of thinking  And that thinking, by the way, doesn't just exist in this  It exists in almost all these weird mysteries 
[02:21:00]  Like people that believe in chemtrails  And people that believe in a lot of other nutty shit  They want mysteries to be real  They want them to be real  And they have confirmation bias to the point where they ignore all the information that points to that this might not be true  Did you ever talk to Richard C. Hoagland?  No, no, I haven't talked to him  But I've watched his lectures  See, that guy's bananas  Yeah, he's the guy who's obsessed with the face on Mars  Despite better pictures showing us a bunch of mountains  He still goes, no, look, you can see the fedora 
[02:21:30]  No, you can't for sure  What do you fucking mind?  Well, he also does these weird measurements  Where he says if you go from this rock to that rock  It's exactly this distance  The same distance from the tip of the pyramid  To the foot of the paw of the Sphinx  Like he makes these weird...  Yeah, which makes no sense  Why did you do that though?  Yeah, yeah, anyone can make anything the same distance  Right, yeah  And measure things that don't even go together  Yeah, you just choose to measure distances  And arbitrarily throw them all together 
[02:22:00]  It's all the same thing  There's a lot of real mysteries in the world  But there's also a lot of muddy thinking  Yeah, that's the problem with that stuff  Because there are so many interesting things  That people, instead of just finding the data that disproves the mystery  They obsess and ignore the data that disproves it  And harp on the teeny bit of data that might  Is a little bit ambiguous and could support it  Exactly  That's why they call it confirmation bias  That you lean towards things that confirm your beliefs  And that's a huge part of what you find 
[02:22:30]  When you start looking into all these things  Whether it's UFOs  That's the other thing  The UFO people  We investigated UFOs  There's almost no evidence  Like, almost none  Yeah  There's a few, like, photographs  That could be fucking anything  And there's a few people that say  There's some radar information  Okay, maybe  But there's not, like, one really hard piece of data  Like, not one piece of metal that you could bring somewhere  And someone can go, that's not from this planet 
[02:23:00]  There's not one thing that we can't do here  And then there's also the reality that  The United States government and other governments  Have been experimenting with experimental aircraft  That they haven't told people about  From the beginning of fucking time  I mean, all this shit that we have today  That looks crazy  Like the stealth bomber  Right  At one point in time  Yeah  It was just an experiment  So they had to fly the experiments  And people would  Have you ever seen a stealth bomber in real life  Flying around? 
[02:23:30]  Looks just like a UFO  If you see it  It's awesome  They're amazing  We were at  When I was filming Fear Factor  It was right after September 11th  So they were flying a lot of those  Out of the Air Force Base out near Palmdale  Which is where we did a lot of the stunts  And every day you would see a fucking UFO fly  Nice  It was amazing  This big black disc  And that's what a stealth bomber is  They look like  Like a  Looks like right out of Star Wars  Or the Harrier jets I think they're called 
[02:24:00]  That hover  I mean there's all kinds of things  Yeah  What we finally see  The only issues I have with UFOs  Is a couple of things  One is  Isn't the guy who started Project Blue Book  Who set out to disprove  Or he was headed Project Blue Book  Set out to disprove UFOs  And wound up becoming convinced that they existed  I don't know how true that is  Yeah  His name is Jay Allen Hynek  Yeah  He started Project Blue Book  And was actually hired to debunk things  They gave him very specific parameters he says 
[02:24:30]  Like if you find something call it swamp gas  If you find something else call it ball lightning  Never whatever you do say that it could be from another world  And so he investigated a bunch of things  And then went on to do this Project Blue Book thing  And went on to write books  But the problem with these guys is  It becomes their career  Yep  They make a living off of it  They go to these conferences  And they make money  And they write books  And they make money  So it gets into that weird area 
[02:25:00]  Like alright maybe  Maybe  But I feel like as we're moving forward with space travel  One of the things that you realize  Is we're concentrating less and less  On sending actual living beings into space  Yeah  And much more on probes  So when you see like a lot of these things  That are flying around in the sky  That like people attribute to UFOs  Isn't it much more likely that that's some drone  That the government's working on?  Something that can do things that you couldn't do 
[02:25:30]  If you had a person inside of it?  I'll tell you what's hard to discount too  Is when pilots will occasionally  You'll hear their transmissions  And they're talking about something flying  And the flight patterns that this thing  Or what it's doing in flight  Really throws them for a loop  That's kind of hard for me to  Because they understand how engines work  They understand how aerodynamics works  And aircraft 
[02:26:00]  They understand all that  But again it makes a lot more sense  That would be something earthly  Unmanned  Yeah  Unmanned  If you told a guy that was  Flying a prop plane from World War I  About a jet engine  Yeah  And you showed him a jet  He'd lose his fucking mind  And think it was something from outer space  Yeah if you showed him one of those  Maybe  Chuck Yeager supersonic jets  Right  That cloud as it passes through the south barrier  Yeah  Yeah  They'd be like that's not from this planet  Yeah that can't be from this planet  It doesn't even have a propeller 
[02:26:30]  Have you seen those photos?  Yeah  Those photos when they pass through the sound barrier  Oh it's amazing  And the cloud is around the jet  It's fucking nuts  Yeah big fucking like a funnel coming off of the front of the plane  I've seen that  And the back  Oh it's amazing  Yeah when you pass the sound barrier  You make this boom  And like there's this  Like there's a visual thing that happens  That you could see in these photos  Of these jets going so fast  Like it warps the sound around them  It's really it warps the air around them 
[02:27:00]  Didn't the Concorde do that?  Yeah yeah  The Concorde was supersonic  I would love to have flown on that once  Before you know  Before they started cracking their wings  I wish it was the one leaving France  I figured that  I was assuming that's the one you'd hope I purchased a ticket on  But I prefer the fucking British Airways  Yes  Well you guys know about what they're trying to do  With this new supersonic tunnel  Between Japan and New York  Or between China and New York  They're gonna do a bunch of these different  Like they run on some sort of form of magnetism 
[02:27:30]  That's gonna be able to go thousands of miles an hour  To be a train  Where you can go from New York to China in like two hours  Wow  How are they gonna build that?  Jesus  They're gonna dig a hole I guess  The same way they did  Make the Holland Tunnel  How the fuck did they do that?  That will take forever  How the fuck did they make the Holland Tunnel?  Good point  But is that easier than just making aircraft  But this is about 20 million Holland Tunnels  Yeah  It's freaky but  All the shit we already have is freaky  I mean how the fuck did they make any train? 
[02:28:00]  You know back when trains were first made  They thought if you went over 35 miles an hour  People would just explode  Yeah  They thought you'd die  It was fatal to go that fast  They thought you're dead  You're never gonna make it  Oh man  Well surely perish  Yeah  They thought you could ride a horse and that's where it ends  The aircraft we have like Branson has that can leave the atmosphere now  I'm not sure  Why wouldn't they just develop that to go to China faster when you leave the atmosphere  Pick up speed  They said they could be to New York and L.A. in an hour doing that if it's developed right 
[02:28:30]  Well that is possible but there's also a lot of shit that's up there that you would maybe fly into  Like other planes it's hard to get out of the way of a bird when you're going 17,000 times  Yeah  You hit a flock of seagulls and you know the fucking whole plane comes down  Like they have to shoot birds down at some airports  When you have like a high bird population they actually hire snipers to take the birds out  Oh really?  Yeah and PETA people get all pissed off they get angry because you know  Why are you killing these birds? Stop flying! What are you doing? 
[02:29:00]  But that's the reality of air travel  Like that that wasn't that the thing the miracle on  Sully yeah he killed a bunch of geese  He killed a bunch of geese  Yeah  Geese murderer  Yeah he's a huge  A fucking rocket plane flies into a pack of birds or a flock of birds and they go into the engine and the engines explode  Yeah he's seen as Hitler by geese  Killed both engines into a flock  Yeah you're right though maybe take it off at that speed you would run into something 
[02:29:30]  Not only that how about the satellites you ever see one of those maps of satellites that are  Oh it's crazy there's so much shit up there  So much shit it's overflowing with shit  I want to see Gravity that movie with Sandra Bullock and Clooney  Where they're on the space station and something like some debris hits them and they're fucking  That looks unbelievable have you seen trailers for that?  No I haven't seen that  Look up the trailers for Gravity it looks really fucking great  Well you know what they're trying to do now like with the space station they're  They're developing these things that are like they're inflatable houses in space 
[02:30:00]  They're like they're these things they're they're instead of like a solid space station  They have to piece together out of all  Here's a wall and there's the roof and all of it comes together  They actually they're inflatable  And they have two of them that are already in orbit  Really?  Yeah yeah there this there's Bigelow Ranch is a guy a Bigelow the same guy who by the way is the one who investigates claims for the for the government now when it comes to the UFO sightings this guy's a UFO enthusiast and some super billionaire who also runs this aerospace company that develops these inflatable some incredibly thick 
[02:30:30]  Powerful material that they use for the walls that's better at withstanding micrometeor impact than the space station is  Wow 
[02:31:00]  Yeah cause that's all you need is a fucking you know one asshole brings up a safety pin  Oh I didn't know  I had a pencil in my pocket  That popped in the house  Well Joe you never disappoint man  Holy fuck  I'm looking forward to this show man  Absolutely  You get good reviews which I was happy for you  Oh thank you man I appreciate it I didn't know I got any reviews but that's awesome I'm psyched  Yeah Joe Rogan questions everything premiering on Syfy tonight at 10 and of course the podcast going strong one of my favorites and it's on three times per weekend here on our channel which is very cool 
[02:31:30]  Yeah hey thanks for that it's an honor I really appreciate being on with you guys you guys are the shit  And I have one of course one question an opinion what do you think about December 28th the Silva Weidman rematch  Oh that's going to be fucking very interesting I think you know nobody expected the result except maybe the Weidman camp but nobody expected to go down that way where you know Silva was fucking around  Oh man  And doing the taunting and gets clipped and knocked unconscious but when a guy knocks you out once that guy can probably do it again 
[02:32:00]  Will he do it again? I don't know but he's going to be confident as fuck and that's not even his strong suit Weidman's strong suit is the ground  He's a really good wrestler four time all American and his submission game is like world class he's a bad motherfucker  Right  He could submit anyone in the world if he gets them into a good position  But you know Anderson Silva is Anderson Silva and there's a reason why everybody called him the greatest fighter ever  Because up until that fight he eliminated guys with spectacular results like front kicking people in the face and knocking them unconscious 
[02:32:30]  People that nobody beat before he ragdolled and treated them like they were dog shit  I mean he's he's the greatest ever  But you know there's in every sport there comes a time when it's over and there comes a time when someone's got your number  Whether or not that was just him fucking around he got caught and he'll come back and destroy Weidman the rematch and let everybody know  He's still the king and you know the king just got a little bored he got silly and he got clipped and now he knows 
[02:33:00]  There's that too but it's gonna be fucking crazy exciting I'll tell you that  It's a no-lose for the UFC because if Weidman wins all of a sudden he's almost this legendary fighter now  Who everyone's gonna see fight again and if Silva wins it's like oh, okay, Silva's back  Well, then we know then you got to go for the third fight  Go for rubber back  Oh, yeah, got it  Depending upon the way it goes down, of course  Yeah, it's gonna be interesting I'll tell you that  Who the fuck knows what's gonna happen but it's gonna be crazy exciting  I can't believe I'm asking this but I'm gonna 
[02:33:30]  There was a does he did does Weidman have his balls or something?  Did he lose his balls or his dick?  What?  Okay, all right  Why?  I saw it on, of course, Twitter or something  Oh, no  There was some weird room  Okay, all right  I figured I'd go right to this  Jesus  The main guy  Well, I haven't seen his balls or his dick  But  I'm assuming they're there until  But how lazy am I that I didn't Google it after I read this tweet  To fucking figure it out myself  Yes, I win, OP 
[02:34:00]  I told you  That probably would have come out before  No kidding  Yeah  All right  All right, you guys, I gotta get the fuck out of here  I love you  All right, man  See you soon, Ryan and Joe  10 o'clock tonight  Next time I'm in New York  So I'll be in studio  Great, we'd love to have you  All right, buddy  Obviously  Take care, guys  Thanks, Joe  Joe Rogan  He's great, man  Big-hearted death squad all over the fucking place  He's a great, great  Oh, my God  He's fascinating  Really, really interesting dude  He was made for radio  Are you kidding me?  Yeah 
[02:34:30]  His podcast is great  I mean  Well, it's radio  It's legitimately good  It's radio  It's just new radio  Yep  It's made for us  What do you guys think about me wearing the sunglasses of course?  It's terrific  That's good luck  It's perfect  Good luck for you  I lost my good ones  So now I got these pieces of garbage  I sit next to you on the airplane  Yeah?

[02:41:30]  Yeah  Is that?  It's time for my face to be seen  I'll be honest with you  I was talking to Keith Robinson about your face only two days ago  And I realized, you know, I spent a lot of time  My girlfriend lived in Coney Island when I was in high school  I spent a lot of time in Coney Island  And I do think, and I'm not kidding  You're descended from the Pinhead tribe somehow  You know when you're weight loss  Most people lose weight and their head gets big and they look weird  Yeah, like Revenel  Your head's shrinking as you lose weight  Well, I'm a small guy, I'm a little fella  You're a pinhead 
[02:42:00]  I'm a little man  Zippy the Pinhead, yes  He's a circus act  Did Keith defend me or did he agree with your analysis?  Oh boy  Come on  Jesus  Yes, Keith has known to flip sides on occasion during the conversation  I'm not gonna call him, he's good  Yeah, come on, let's be supportive  Middle head  You're right, that's exactly right 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, of course  As he boxes every day and gets fatter  Keith really is a miracle  It's like what, you dip your boxing gloves in chocolate and fucking punch each other?  Alright guys, I'll see you up there  Sounds good, Kyle  I'm gonna see you showing him up there  Very good  See you tomorrow  Allah Akbar, see you  Alright  Allah Akbar  Yeah, let's go pay  Alright, let's  The Opinion Entry Show

[02:43:30]  Bob and Doug McKenzie  Yeah  That's the song?  It's called Take Off  Take Off  There used to be a segment called The Great White North on SCTV  I never liked that  And they would talk about Canadian things  And they were Canadian so, you know, I guess they thought it was funny  Were you a fan of Bob and Doug McKenzie?  They'd talk about tukes  Tukes  Tukes  And beer  And they did a movie called, what was it?  Homebrew?  What was it called?  Strange Brew  Strange Brew  Thank you  Strange Brew  Yeah  Look what's inside of you 
[02:44:00]  What happened?  What happened now?  Jim  What?  So, so he can't go  That's perfect  What?  That fits the whole motif of this  Why's he even going?  We don't need him up there, we got you  I know, right?  I'm serious  I'm not even  I'm serious  We don't need him  I got everything ready for you guys  Travis is on it, man 
[02:44:30]  We don't need Gary  And now we're learning he forgot his passport so he has to go home and get it  Where does he live?  He lives in Philly  Does he live in Jersey or in New York?  Yeah, he's in Jersey  He has to go back to Jersey?  It's alright, there's not much traffic right now  Oh no, there probably isn't  Oh, Jimmy  Are we flying out of Jersey though?  Oh, no we're not  No  Oh, we're not?  No  Oh, not LaGuardia  LaGuardia  Oh, with that banking turn?  Oh, fuck  Yeah  LaGuardia  When did he leave to go back to Jersey?  Uh, I heard a while ago 
[02:45:00]  I'm sure he's flying  Oh my god  I hope it was just now  You were hoping he was like  He'd be like running down 6th Avenue  Trying to catch the van  No, I hope he's sitting in the Lincoln Tunnel  Honking ferociously  With his LaGage  He's like fucking Lucy  Lucy, you forgot your passport  How did he forget it?  How did he forget that?  He's the guy  I'm getting mine after him  He's the guy  He also forgot his hair  Oh, shit  I didn't say it 
[02:45:30]  I think we should make Gary wear wigs  Yeah  Tell him he has to wear a wig on the Montreal trip  Yes, he was embarrassing  Please  What kind?  I think we have the old chip wig in the office  The old what?  The old chip wig?  I want to see that  I want to wear  I want to use that eventually  Okay  Whatever  We should bring that with us actually  What if we got here?  What?  For some street interviews  Should we like end the show?  Because we got to get ready for our  No  How are we getting ready?  We're actually  No, we have to get ready 
[02:46:00]  We can actually go  Because I'm not going to do an after show  You're doing an after show?  No  So we can go until about 10-15 if you want to  Get the fuck out  No after show, it's Christmas for the listeners ears  How dare you  I was listening to the Jim Norton advice show  And man, you got some people that are fucked up  Yeah  Holy shit  Yeah  And I'm like  I start wincing at the  When I hear him talking  I'm like  Oh my god, do they understand they're calling Jim Norton? 
[02:46:30]  And then Jim gives him great fucking advice  Yeah  Very helpful  That guy, first of all  Because I think really quickly what I would say  And when that guy called up and said  He's banging some 62 year old woman  And he looks like the 62 year old woman's son  Yeah  People saying how it's kind of twisted and sick  That this woman found some guy that looks like a son  And I couldn't think of anything  I'm just thinking  Yeah, ugh, that's disgusting  And Jimmy goes  Maybe the reason you look like the son is because that's 
[02:47:00]  The father who she fucked to have the son looks like the son  And that's her type of guy  The fuck  I'm like god damn that Jimmy  That's fucking pretty clever  Well my first thought was yuck  The first thing I thought of it that I'm like why would she  You know it didn't make sense  Yeah, yeah  That she was trying to fuck her son  And it just made sense  Your fucking like addiction advice is really good man  Oh thanks man  Just people, and you could tell people are sincerely like happy to have spoken with you about it 
[02:47:30]  Well it's really good  It's really good  I thought it was going to be a big goof  Like yeah I was like ah we'll just goof on people  And they call them with silly shit  Yeah, yeah  But more people than not call them with real problems  Yeah  Like fucking sex addiction  Yeah  Like serious shit  Yeah  Like oh man this is  And I'm just  I'm cringing going  Oh no Jimmy's gonna fucking send this guy off a bridge  Or something  And then he fucking talks them down  It's nice  The other side of that though  Yeah  They fucking take their problems out on us on Twitter 
[02:48:00]  That's true  Those are the guys  Yeah  Those are the guys  Now Jimmy's like the fucking  Maybe not all of them  He's like the therapist  A lot of them  I'm trying to be helpful  Yeah  Trying to help people  You are  Guide them  It's a solid show  You are helpful  It's on kind of on Wednesdays  It is it's real good  Yeah kind of on Wednesdays  Let's call it kind of on Wednesdays  I like the pacing of it is really nice  You know the amount of calls you take during it  It works out really well  I know I'm lapping your ass here  No I appreciate it  But it really is good 
[02:48:30]  What type of advice would you give to somebody who's like a boss?  Somebody who's like a boss  But  And they keep getting made fun of by like these guys who have a radio show  And he's going on a trip with them and then he realized he forgot his passport  Look I understand how that can happen  We all forget things  In your case I think you should put a hose in the exhaust pipe  And the other half of your window and just think about what happened  It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy  Yeah  Yeah  You're automatically uncomfortable 
[02:49:00]  You're panicking because you know the guys are judging everything you do  And in your panic you forget your passport  Right  Self fulfilling prophecy  Right  So quit  Could he put a dead animal on his head before he kills himself?  Oh my God  Just something to class it up a little bit  Yeah  For whoever finds you  Yeah  What's going on at Subway?  Another guy fucking with the food I see  Sam Roberts  Oh boy  Who was the last guy?  I can't keep track of these  These  Well there was the guy a few years back 
[02:49:30]  There was the guy who was like  Didn't he take a bath in the sink at Burger King or KFC?  What was the recent one though?  I forget already  That was Taco Bell wasn't it?  Yeah  Oh he was licking the taco shells I think?  Yeah he was licking taco shells  That's disgusting  Most people are bothered by that  That just makes me laugh  But there's some guy somewhere just licking taco shells  Licking taco shells  Well we got a new one  Yeah  At Subway  Yeah they fired an employee who put his penis  Oh no 
[02:50:00]  On sandwich bread and posted pictures on Instagram  Oh this fucking guy  You gotta laugh at that  No because he makes me a sandwich  I eat at Subway  I'll take the chance  You might get a dick sandwich  Oh he's just pressing the  He's just making a helmet head in your bread  So what? What's wrong with that?  He's fucking making a sandwich  Yeah he's just  He's just pressing his helmet into it  I don't wanna worry about getting licking taco or dick bread  You're not gonna get sick  You're just gonna laugh 
[02:50:30]  The two breads they look like fucking Peckins  Oh gosh  Chip with the Peckins  Chip with the fucking Peckins  Shit  He's a guy out of Columbus, Ohio  And he writes  My name is Ian Jett on Twitter  And I will be your sandwich artist today  Read a caption that accompanied the not suitable for work picture  That appeared on Jett's feed 
[02:51:00]  How do you spell Jett?  I wanna follow him  J-E-T-T  When confronted about the picture  Jett tried to clarify his reason for sharing the image of him  Draping his penis over the foot  Oh, come on  That's very  I wish that a newspaper article would say that I could drape my penis over something  That's very impressive  I would never do that at work  It was at home  Oh, now he's backtracking  He said he did it at home  Yeah, with those fucking things  You don't have those things at home 
[02:51:30]  This isn't something I'd ever do at Subway  It was totally a joke  I would never put my dick on the bread at Subway  That's horrible  I only do that at home  Why would you do it at home?  And then eat your own dick sandwich?  Fuck yeah  You do that?  Amen  Oh my God  As if seeing a man's penis resting atop the restaurant sandwich bread isn't enough bad PR for a single news cycle  A second employee at the same Subway also posted a picture of what he purported to be his own frozen urine 
[02:52:00]  Yeah  Where is this?  What Subway is this?  That's his frozen urine right there  And it says today at work I froze my pee  It looks like a...  That's good  It looks like a creamsicle  That's correct  A frozen creamsicle  Fucking assholes  Today at work I froze my pee  There it is  They should be beaten  No  They should be beaten  They should be given managerial positions  It's in Columbus, Ohio  Predictably, the photos did not sit well with Subway  Which fired both Boggs and Jet 
[02:52:30]  Of course they did  Of course they did  This isolated incident is not representative of Subway  Oh really?  We know, we don't think...  We...  We...  Yeah, yeah, we didn't think, you know...  Every Subway was doing this  We're proud of these boys  Right  These actions are not tolerated  And the franchisee took immediate action to terminate the two employees involved  Cameron Boggs' Instagram name, by the way  He was the one posting the pictures  Weed Priest  Oh, Weed Priest 
[02:53:00]  Yes  Oh man  I thought it was, uh...  Carlos Danger  No  No, okay  Man, I, um...  There you go  I went to the movies last night  What?  Again?  I saw...  The Conjuring  You went  I went  You son of a bitch  I saw...  The Conjuring  Can I...  Can I make a prediction?  Go ahead  You hated it  Because you would have talked about it at the start of the show  Didn't hate it, but... 
[02:53:30]  Didn't like it too much  You know what?  It was just there?  The trailer was 8 million times scarier watching it right here than it was the movie  Wow  The movie, not very scary  Not fucking very anything  I didn't like the end that much  But again, they were staying true to what the story was  I liked that they did that  But were you scared, Jimmy?  Yes  At times I was, yes  There was a couple of jump moments  A couple of jump moments  On top of the fucking dresser?  Yeah, that was pretty creepy  But not to the point where it was like...  They showed too much in the trailer 
[02:54:00]  They really did  They blew it  Because I knew what was going on with the music box  Because we saw it in the trailer  Knew that thing up on the thing  You knew the...  Clap behind the...  Like all those things  That you're supposed to be scared of in the theater  They show  Once you see them, they're not surprises anymore  I'm looking forward to them  You need surprises  Yes, terrible  Yeah, movie trailer people should be executed  Yeah, it's terrible  But how else do you sell a movie called The Conjuring?  They got everyone talking  Show some parts of it  Show something  Convey that it's fucking scary 
[02:54:30]  You know, do something to where you don't even show the movie  They don't care because they just need you to get in the theater for that first weekend  Exactly  That's it  So then all these people that went and saw it went  Fuck, it was just like the trailer  Yeah  So it kind of works for their purposes unfortunately  Yeah  For marketing  Yup  Because then you come out and go  You know what, the movie was...  You know, the trailer was way scarier  And then okay, the numbers are gonna drop the second week anyway  Yeah  I bet you that's why they do it  I would love to get someone from Hollywood to talk about trailers 
[02:55:00]  Hollywood  What do you wanna know?  Jimmy rushes back to the microphone  Jimmy's Hollywood  Cause there's obviously, there's some logic behind the whole fucking thing  They know they're giving away the whole movie  Uh huh  So why are they doing it?  They probably have a great explanation for that  Yeah  So what would you give it? Just kind of an average?  Very average  It was just kind of there  I found myself, you know, between the halfway mark and the end  Somewhere in there  I was starting to get a little fidgety 
[02:55:30]  Really?  I'm like...  Alright, something  I'll say it got a little cheesy at one point too towards the end  Yeah  Yes, yes  Yeah, I know  Yeah, that was kind of like, you know  It was done amazingly well in another movie  I don't think we need to revisit  Absolutely  One of those scenes, you know  Yeah, yeah  It was a little much  What have we got here?  A little fucking tour going on?  Yeah, it's some...  Oh, sure 
[02:56:00]  Everybody's looking  Well, yay!  Look at the microphones and the people  Everybody's learning  Knowledge is good  We gotta go to Chicago  Yeah, yeah  No, I mean, Mark wants in on the whole food thing  But we'd go right now  Marky  Hey guys, I worked at an Arby's in High School  Braggart  I have those giant roast beefs  Oh, yeah  I fingered it and I fucked it  What?  Oh, fuck  Oh, yeah  Why are you mad?  I think this is hilarious 
[02:56:30]  Because you go to those places  You don't want to get food  Who knows?  Just remember that  This guy's fucked?  Next time you have food poisoning  It's probably because some guy was fucking  Some fucking hepatitis  Right  Someone's fucking your food  Your roast beef  Did you serve the roast beef after you gave it a good fuck?  I'm sure someone did  Yeah  I just did it to let everyone catch me and find it funny  But, uh...  Right  Yeah, I got served  Well, nowadays you can't get away with shit  Well, I can Instagram it  Because everyone's posting it  Yeah, well, if Weed Priest is around 
[02:57:00]  Hmm  Alright, sir  Did you climax in the roast beef?  Uh...  Unfortunately, no, sir  Thank God  Wouldn't that be the horsey sauce?  What was it called?  Horsy sauce or something?  Oh, yes  Oh  We were...  We were good for a couple of roast beef sandwiches  On the way to Waiting River  To stop off at an Arby's  Was that when you would pass by the movie theater?  Alright, yes  Drive right by  But at least we got Arby's  Oh, Travis has fucked food before  Yeah, all the time  Sure  No 
[02:57:30]  Did you angrily fuck a knish?  Or a mozzarella soup  I get it  When I used to work at Burger King  We had a manager  Who didn't like this one customer  I don't remember why  But he...  Whenever he would hear him  Because we were in our headsets  And he would come through the drive-through  And he recognized his voice  And he would always like  Put soap in his burgers  And smash them on the floor  And put out cigarettes in his burgers  Oh, no  Just because he didn't like  And this was back like  I mean, this was only 15 years ago 
[02:58:00]  And we were still smoking in the back of  And it would be 15 years in the future  I hope I'd at least be manager  You didn't forget your passport today?  No, my wife has it  Who did?  Oh, Gary  Do you have yours?  Yeah, I got mine  Who likes to think he's in charge?  That's cute  Oh, boy  I got my passport too  What would you charge if you don't have your passport?  That's like a given  What would be better than what?  That is the thing 
[02:58:30]  Like, you fucking  You remember your passport  You can buy everything else you forget  I wish he would have fucking remembered online  Oh, God  Just like  Checking his pockets  Oh, that panicked check  Like, maybe it's  Maybe it's appeared in my back pocket since I checked 30 seconds ago  I really want to fucking  I want to take a fucking  I want to take like a  A toaster cord and whip Sam's ankles  It's just mean  I don't know  I want to whip your ankles 
[02:59:00]  Well, see, Sam's smart  He knows that he's going to have to take his shoes off to get on  I told  It's got nothing to do  It's  Oh, you're going to walk through there with no socks on?  Fuck yeah  You don't  You got Sperry's  You're not going to wear socks?  Sperry's?  Hell  Fucking  Give Jessica Alba ankles  Oh, wow  That's not very masculine  I'm alright with that  Would you kiss Sam's ankles?  Kiss it  Give him a kiss, Travis  I would under the right circumstances  No, I'm not just going to give him a kiss because you're asking 
[02:59:30]  I want one  Yeah  Kiss your little ankles  That's what I was hoping for  Kiss the ankle  Let's go to Bobby  He did shit with food as well  Bobby  You know, dude  Oh  It's our topic of the day  Denny would be proud  Go ahead, Bobby  What's up, boys?  Yeah  Back in the good old crazy 90s  When I used to work in produce  You would always have that old lady  That would come to the back room  And ask  Hey, can you cut me a fresh watermelon?  We used to wrap it before we wrapped it  I would lick the whole fucking thing  And put it in the corner 
[03:00:00]  And what?  And put my teeth marked in the corner  You can't get mad at this, I'm sorry  Toad is not taste  Toad is not taste  Toad is not taste, boys  That's just funny  You would lick the whole thing?

I don't know  I don't always wash my fruit  You should  Always  It's one extra step  Before you get to the goodness  Just wash the fruit  No, I don't feel like it  It's gross  That's what your father would say to your mother  When you were in the tub  That's not nice  Get it?  Get it?  It's very easy to get it  It's not subtle  Saying you're homosexual  I know  You guys want another one?  Rock enjoyed that  Yeah, look at him  He's so happy  Oh, he's go falling in there

[03:02:00]  I thought it was some born identity shit going on with the chicken joint  Mr. Chicken  Or if we're in Montreal  Mr. Chico  They call me Mr. Chicken  Mr. Chicken  Tear down that wall  Hello, I'm Mr. Chicken  Mr. Ed  Go ahead there  So, Mr. Chicken  Here's to you, Mr. Chicken  Sorry  What happened, Mr. Chicken? 
[03:02:30]  Well, I didn't say the name  Just because I figured you guys would have never heard of it  But anyway, on Wednesday they had a special  And, well, there used to be just a certain community that would come in on Wednesdays because it was especially cheap  All right, so the blacks would go into Mr. Chicken and  God, I know  Yeah, who are we?  Your vagary is horrendous  Yeah, certain people  This is not court  Talking to a dick joke show  This is worse than beep beep shoot  Exactly  Can't really figure this out 
[03:03:00]  At least Denny's racism is clearing out of the open  Right  Can't figure this riddle out  Yeah, so go ahead, sir  You, uh, would, uh, certain community members  Canadians  Wink wink  We call them Mondays  Go ahead  Go ahead, sir  Well, we would, uh, not rock it in the gravy for the potatoes  Oh, my God  That was a little rough, Sam  That's horrible  I was okay with all of them until  Because I appreciate a good gravy  People coming in just to have a nice, inexpensive meal  Because I don't have a lot of money 
[03:03:30]  They gotta deal with your snot rocket  And that one's just racial  Yeah  They didn't even do anything  That's terrible  You're a bad person  That makes me sad when people wreck  Fuck out of the homeless food  Why?  I feel bad  Because there's a vulnerability in it  Like, when you're buying food  You're just going on a good phase  It just makes me really sad for the people eating it  Serves your right for not washing your mashed potatoes before you eat them  Yeah, how do you  Who strains them from boogers?  Wow  Who thinks it's gross?  Imagine you're about to put a big heap in your mouth 
[03:04:00]  And there's just a boogie staring at you  Imagine you see yourself in the mirror with one already in your mouth  And the boogers hanging out like a fucking  Like a fucking Cuervo worm  Do you remember the first time you realized you could do that though?  Sure  My own potatoes  Every time we talk about snot rockets  It brings me back to high school  Bill Madden was the guy that fucking snot rocketed his ass off  It's so fucking disgusting  It was amazing to me though  I can't do it  He was on the basketball team with me  And he would run up the court and just fucking blow snot rockets 
[03:04:30]  As he was getting back on defense  And I couldn't believe you could actually do that  And it worked  I got to go down with my fingernail  I got to scrape the cave wall clean  And then I dine on it  All right, we got another guy  Long Island seems to be a hotbed of activity  Sure it is  For food abuse  What's up, sir?  Hey, is that me?  Yes, sir  Yes  All right, well, I turned around one night  I'm a baker  And I witnessed 
[03:05:00]  For your father  For your father  Enzo, call me Enzo  Enzo  And did you make a cake?  Woof, they groomed a bride  Woof  I witnessed one of my co-workers  Fucking a donut doe  Oh my god  Wow  Yeah  I had the same thing happen to me when I played baseball  See, cause that's what they put on the bats to make them happy  He fucked a donut?  I wish it was a cronut and rolling in it  It's not a donut  It's a donut doe  Oh, the donut doe 
[03:05:30]  Cause yeah, you fuck a donut, you're going right through the thing  He would fuck a donut  It's not as bad as fucking the doe  He would fuck a donut doe?  Yeah  Somebody put his dick in the register  And then he started up  And then  I had to leave  I had to leave and go to the bar next door  Oh, sure  Fascinating  Why'd you have to go to the bar next door?  That was way better than enjoying the Jim Norton laugh  Yeah, probably loaded up on donuts  All right, sir, thank you  Let's go to Eddie in Massachusetts  Eddie  Hey, how's it going?  Hi, Ed 
[03:06:00]  I used to work at a deli  And we actually had to let somebody go  Because the kid got caught  Putting the hot  You know, like  You know when you go to a deli  Like a supermarket  There's the hot dogs out in the case?  Instead of buying the whole pack  You buy them singly?  Yeah  Well, one Saturday morning  We had to let this kid go  Because some old lady  After he had just filled the case  Asked for a fresh one in the back  And because he was pissed that he had to take the extra two seconds  To go back and grab hot dogs  He threw the hot dogs down in his pants  And then gave them to him 
[03:06:30]  While the hot dogs were down in his pants  And he was fishing them up  Someone from management walked in on the whole thing  So pretty much let him go on the spot  I'd love to know what his explanation was in that moment  What did he panically say?  In a panic  What did he say?  Maybe  You know what?  Maybe he admitted to stealing them or something  Because that's a little bit better than  Tainting some old lady's hot dogs  With your own hot dogs  Yeah, I hate people that mess with food, man  Hmm  Something really sad about that 
[03:07:00]  Alright, thank you, sir  Yeah  Hey, have a great day, guys  Well, they should pay the employees more  That's true  Then they won't be disgruntled  They won't be fucking your food  Hmm  Let's say hi to Abe in Colorado  Abe  Well, at least you know he'll be telling the truth  Yeah, I used to work at a coca deli when I was in high school  And my specialty was fucking the potato salad  It's a specialty  What the fuck is going on?  It's a specialty, Ant  Hey, it's my specialty  I'm mud on like Muddy used to fuck  That makes him proud 
[03:07:30]  That was his specialty  Yeah  Who else do you know fucked the potato salad?  Mmm  That was me  We had macaroni salad  That was me  Which you would think would have been softer  But the potato salad was like  You ever fuck one of those girls that had like a scratchy pussy?  It was kinda like that  Yes  On a paper plate at a picnic, I did  But it was really the owner's fault  He set me up for bad hygiene  Why?  Was the potato salad dressed seductively? 
[03:08:00]  Yes  Very hot  It was way too cute  It wasn't very kosher  It was asking for  On my very first day of work  He gave me a bottle of nail polish remover  And had me removing the expiration dates off the hot dog packages  So I figured I was in it clear for other weird shit  Wow, they do that?  He did  He was nasty  He used to cut up the  But do hot dogs ever expire?  They seem like they would last forever anyway  Yeah  Maybe I didn't eat them 
[03:08:30]  Or the potato salad  Alright, nice man  That was great  Appreciate it  Guy used to work in a movie theater  What could possibly go wrong in a movie theater?  He's probably pissed in the popcorn  Butter the popcorn with jizz  With boogers and the pretzel nuggets  Oh my god  Some jerk off move  He fucking put swizzlers up his ass like corkscrews  Pulled out shit corks  They went in red and came out fucking licorice later  Some fucking audible  Go ahead Ryan  What did you do at the movie theater?  Hey guys, I didn't do anything  We had a guy there 
[03:09:00]  But he was like the champion at destroying food  I would suggest when you go to the theater  Don't ever get popcorn out of those giant scoop bins  As opposed to the other ways they serve popcorn at the movie theater  You mean the one where you step on the clown's foot and the popcorn shoots out of his mouth?  The one where they fry up individual kernels one at a time  You don't understand man, we come from another planet  We need this explained to us  If you guys can get popcorn directly out of the popper  Like you know sometimes  But you're not explaining why you don't eat it from the big fucking popcorn thingy 
[03:09:30]  No, we would have guys that would just spit in there and not rock it  One guy would put his hands down his pants and reach in and just grab through the popcorn  Those things are just disgusting  A bunch of assholes  Great  It's not great  It's not great  I go to the movies you get popcorn all the time  It's pretty obvious that our food is being fucked  Stop fucking the food out there, America 
[03:10:00]  You know what I used to do when I worked in a restaurant?  Laugh, Chipper  I used to break up glass and put it in the egg salad  That isn't even fucking...  He didn't do it  Yeah I did  I broke a bottle and I crushed up the glass in there  You didn't even work anywhere  You'd never had a job  I did so  You're a moron like you  Look for catering hall  Now we got a sick one coming in  We go to Iowa for this shit  Eric, go ahead  The devil's catering hall  Hey man  Hey, I used to bartend and this guy, a neighbor used to bring me over like chili and stuff on Saturday nights 
[03:10:30]  And one of the guys at the bar, the regulars, put a bunch of really hot horseradish in it  And I thought, man, they're all laughing at me and stuff  So after he'd had about six beers, he'd switch to scotch on the rocks  So I set up his glass and I poured Tabasco sauce all around that fucking thing  And by the time he had about five shots of that, he was licking his lips, looking like fucking Mr. Ed 
[03:11:00]  It was just hilarious  He had the shits, burning shits for about a day and a half  That would have been a great story if it ended with a gunshot  What?  Jimmy's saying that it was a great story  He actually liked that one a lot  Thank you, sir  Everyone, have a wonderful day, ONA  Three days a week  Three days a week  Oh, boy  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island 
[03:11:30]  We're changing topics a little bit  Go ahead, Chris  Hey, what's up, boys? Chris the teacher  Good to talk to you guys  Hi, Jimmy, how are you doing?  I wish we could say the same  Thanks, Chris  So you'll be happy to know  I know I'm shifting topics  But I did used to come into Baskin Robbins cakes when the people were mean  But I'm not proud of it  I was a kid, it was very stupid  And we all used to have sex  How do you keep a rod over a Baskin Robbins cake? 
[03:12:00]  How do you not?  How do you not?  Yeah, that's a little cold, right?  Well, just  So I just wasn't banging the cake  I was just jerking it and then shot into the cake  Ah, whatever  That isn't even  What's the purpose of your phone call, Chris?  So I just re-upped my satellite radio subscription for my new car  Congrats  Me and my wife  Yeah, I know, I got the check  Thanks 
[03:12:30]  And I go  Am I still going to get the open anti-channel?  He tells me you're going to lose a bunch of channels such as Radio Sex, Howard Stern  So yeah, I was really upset  And he goes, no, you're still going to have open anti-channel  I said, good, because this is the only reason why I'm keeping the service  And the guy goes, really?  I'm like, yeah, why?  He goes, well, I'm just surprised that you would keep the service for them  I'm like, no, this is the only reason  He goes, no, no, no, what I mean is because you're from New York  And, you know, you don't keep it for Stern, you keep it for open anti-channel 
[03:13:00]  And I said, what, you don't listen to him?  He goes, no, no, not my cup of tea  Not my cup of tea  That's our customer service  Mm-hmm  That's why I took the call  They shouldn't be doing that shit  Well, I said that I'm actually doing it to spite you  Because I would just, I used to have in my old car  You'd get like a bill every other month  And it would charge you every fourth month  And it would reactivation fees on top of reactivation  You guys know Louie went off on the customer service, you know  No, I didn't hear that rant 
[03:13:30]  I didn't hear it, what happened?  All right, I'm glad I called to like help you out and get ridiculed  He does have a point  All right, Chris, thank you so much  Look at the time  He is a long time listener  Yeah, we gotta go  I gotta go to the bank  What?  Well, there's my bank, I gotta cash check  All right, I should go to the bank too  Cha-ching  Can we play the CNN report? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah  Before we leave?  Sure  These clips are always fun  Good phone topic today  Good phone topic  Yes  Should ask Danny if you liked the phone topic tonight  I bet he did  You think he did?  Yeah, for sure  And now this  The temperatures change really quickly  Those are the ones that are going to be in the most trouble  Now extinctions, I don't have to tell you  Have been part of the natural history of the world for millennia  And man-made extinctions have even happened before 
[03:14:30]  I guess we hunted the dildo into extinction  The dildo?  The dildo, rather, forgive me  I'm having trouble with my words today  The dildo into extinction  Are we going to see  The dildo  Into extinction  Hunting the dildo  Why would he see them?  You gotta trap them in your ass  That's how you hunt them  Yeah  And then you keep jumping up and down  Until they disappear forever  Forever  Oh, fucking A 
[03:15:00]  Alright  Yeah  I go to the bank too, shit  Let's go to the bank  Which bank are you going to?  B of A  Oh, good, that's good code  There's only like two banks people use these days  Sure  B of A or Chase  Everything else has fucking been scooped up by either of those entities  No more HSBC, huh?  Nah, none of that shit  That's a shame  You're going to go to the Franklin National Bank on the corner  Pull out your fucking passbook 
[03:15:30]  Have them stamp it with the amount of money you just deposited  So you can look at it proudly  Three more dollars in my account, mom  HSBC, you know what that stands for?  Why?  Holy shit, big cock  What?  Why?  Why wasn't Pecker in there?  Because it's not HSBC  What does PNC Bank stand for?  Exactly  Chip's obsessed with Peckys 
[03:16:00]  Something, I got it, something  I love what Chip's obsessed with Peckys  Oh, I was thinking of the middle one  Oh, no  No  I was trying to get the Peckys thing going  Alright, um  Well, yeah, time to go to the bank  That's uh, that's it  Yeah, that's it  We'll hear you from, uh  Montreal, Canada  Canada  Canada  They'll hear us  They'll hear us  They'll hear us too  I wear headphones  You said we'll hear you, you won't hear the audience  I was talking to you guys 
[03:16:30]  Oh, cool  All we have to do is take one phone call and we hear them  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  No after show today  Ha ha  When are we leaving?  I'm going to Montreal  I'm going to the bank  Alright  See you guys  See you in the car in a few minutes  See you in the, um  I'm  See you  Yeah, see you in a few  See you  I gotta go to the bank  Hey Roland, little kidding 
[03:17:00]  When is the car leaving?  10.30  Really?  Yeah  We have 20 more minutes?  Yeah, we got to get our shit together though  What do I have to do?  Do you have to go home and pack?  Ii packed this morning at 4.30 in the morning in the dark  He nailed you though  you, though. Actually, I almost  decided to go there without anything.  And then I was going to buy stuff and just leave  it in Canada. You need your passport,  though. I got my passport. Look. Good.  Right here. Good.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think I got to print some shit out. 
[03:17:30]  What do we have to print out? I don't know.  But that's the information that I need to get  like now.  What do you mean? Before the car leaves.  What do you have to print out?  Boarding passes, maybe? I don't know.  Nah, we're all set. All good? Yeah, we're  good. Did you change any money  over? No. Oh, you know what I  have to do? I have to get an international plan on my  phone for a couple days. Yeah, I didn't  do that. Right, Kenny? I just figured I wouldn't  use my phone. Nobody calls me.  You're going to have to use it for something.  No. Use the Wi-Fi. You send one text 
[03:18:00]  message. Oh, really?  Well, iPhones can use Wi-Fi, so...  I got Wi-Fi. We just go iPhone  to iPhone with the texting. That's free on Wi-Fi.  I got a Wi-Fi. I'm going to take  advantage of the Wi-Fi. And you FaceTime  on iPhone, on Wi-Fi, so you're good to  go. Who are you going to FaceTime with?  Probably my wife, I guess.  Really?  How's that going to happen?  She's also got a phone.  I don't know.  She's got a phone as well, so we'll do it from 
[03:18:30]  one phone to the other phone.  Will she be available for that?  Hopefully. I mean, I guess it depends on  the time, but hopefully she's not  too busy. She may be at work,  you know, during the day, but maybe during the evening.  Have you ever got a  sexting text from Club Star to Kenny?  I don't know.  You would know. I got my first  the other day, and it was really creepy.  What did it say?  I was alone for a day,  so he asked if  he wanted 
[03:19:00]  to... Wait. He asked me  if  I wanted him to come over  and blow me and stick a finger  in my ass. What?  Why would you go there?  Well, what would you do to him?  Nothing.  I would say... A prude.  You want me to come over and like... Then I feel the pressure.  I got him right back, so I'm like...  I write, ooh, tempting,  but I think I'll have to pass  was my response.  Just trying to be cool, but still no.  Worst response ever.  Right. 
[03:19:30]  I would just text him back, absolutely not.  You've never had a...  I didn't give up.  No, but Kenny calls all texts  sex.  Oh, he sent an E-Rock one.  Yeah, a while ago.  My wife was away,  and he knew she was gone.  Right.  Because he follows her on Facebook.  Yeah.  And he wrote me back,  and he's like,  so are you jerking off?  What a true creep you are.  Well, that's what men do.  It's a good relationship.  No, it's not.  You don't jerk off. 
[03:20:00]  I don't ask other men about that.  Yeah, but we don't like  ask each other about it.  E-Rock, what was your response?  I didn't respond.  But because you're in a weird position.  You're like,  I got to write something.  I confronted him in person  the next day at work.  Did you tell him  it was inappropriate?  I said,  what is this?  And he goes,  well, you know,  you got to pass the time.  That's right.  I mean, that logic,  I'm not going to argue with.  See, Sam,  you're not special.  You haven't got a sexting from  Sam's very uptight.  Club sort of Kenny.  Yeah, I'm kind of happy about that. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, because I was trying  to help Sam last night  with something  and he got all,  What was that?  Out of sorts about it.  What was that?  Kenny was trying to,  well, he was making comments  about me having relations  with my wife.  And I didn't think  it was quite frankly  any of his business.  Yeah.  That's like private stuff.  It's private, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.  I'm a friend.  No, you're not.  You're a co-worker  and barely one at that. 
[03:21:00]  You guys aren't friends?  Because you don't work?  No, because you don't work,  Sleepy.  You were falling asleep today.  Not today.  No, not today.  You had heavy eyes over here.  I was watching you.  A little heavy.  A little heavy.  If I sit down,  I'm done.  I actually haven't seen him.  You had heavy eyes over there.  Yeah, if I sit down,  I'm done.  I haven't seen him  be flat out of sleep  in a long time.  Kenny works hard.  He does?  Yes, he does.  I put in a lot of hours.  He puts in hours.  I don't know if he works hard.  He puts in a lot of wasteful hours.  Yeah, that's what he does. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  Keeping track of every time  I ordered oatmeal and blueberries.  Yeah.  And then sends me a report  like I'm going to check it.  You know,  you got to be  diligent.  It's true.  Man, we should go.  Yeah, man.  We're going to be in Montreal tomorrow.  Today, we'll be there,  but then,  as far as the audience is concerned,  tomorrow.  Yeah.  I'm promoting a video,  Sam Roberts.  What?  Is it my interview  with Stacey Keebler  on YouTube? 
[03:22:00]  How'd she look?  Banging.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what you did to her?  Let me see what she looks like.  Fuck my video.  I don't care.  She has legs for days.  I guess that looks like.  Well, she's sitting.  All right.  Did it do an upskirt?  No.  Why not?  Well, first of all,  I wasn't filming.  Who was filming?  Rolando,  says my cameraman.  All right.  Let's see if he's a leg man.  Oh, my God.  Roland's not a leg man.  Everyone knows she has great legs.  Why are we seeing from her  waist up? 
[03:22:30]  She's got a beautiful face, too.  Yeah.  Did you ask her about George Clooney?  Yeah, a little bit.  And what'd she say?  She gave me the answer  that they're still friends  and all that.  Yeah, the fake shit.  Yeah.  I asked her about wrestling  for most of the time.  Right.  To be honest.  Why?  Get into the George Clooney thing.  Because I talked about it a little bit.  She's not giving you  any good answers on that,  but she'll talk about wrestling.  I heard the interview.  He wanted to know  if she made out  with Vince McMahon.  Why would you ask that?  Because I think  that's an interesting question.  And why isn't Rolando?  Because Sam wants to make out  with Vince McMahon.  That's why he asked that. 
[03:23:00]  You would, right?  For the job?  Would I or do I want to?  Would you tickle his ass?  Would you atone?  Sorry, ladies.  For storyline?  No, just for the job.  Yeah, I guess so.  You would, right?  For the job.  Yeah, I mean.  For the job.  Depending on the job.  It's not for the job.  It's your dream job, so.  If it was the right job,  yeah, you got to.  That's how I got this job.  Why aren't we seeing her legs?  You have the worst...  Does Roland understand  she has the best legs in America?  She's got great legs.  We wouldn't know  from your video. 
[03:23:30]  Well, you know,  she was sitting in her legs  and tucked under the console.  Why would she bend down  and fucking just shoot  under the console  at her legs?  That may be conspicuous.  Who cares?  That's what I would have done.  Let me be your camera guy  for one interview.  No.  I'll show you how  to fucking film this stuff.  No, you'll ruin my interviews.  No, you just kind of  quietly lower the camera  until it's just, you know,  shooting the legs.  You got a good YouTube channel, GH.  I sure do, Kenny.  And Instagram.  I sure do, Kenny.  I'm talking about me right now.  No, it doesn't lead  to my latest video.  Oh.  I do working titles 
[03:24:00]  for my videos now.  Yeah, I saw you tweeted that.  I didn't understand it  not one bit.  Not whatsoever.  I didn't even know  if it was in poor taste  because I didn't get it.  No, when you're working  on a video,  you got to have  a working title.  Sure.  So the working title  for my latest video  is Best of Trayvon.  But it has nothing  to do with Trayvon.  It's just a working title.  That's why it's called  a working title.  I understand that.  But we're going to eventually  come up with a better title.  The video's done.  Yeah, I know.  I just haven't been able 
[03:24:30]  to edit the name  of the video yet.  So I'm still in the  working title phase,  which is it's called  Best of Trayvon.  But it's just a Best  of Your Elevator show.  Yeah, but that sounds boring.  So I've got to come up  with a better name.  The Elevator show's  on hiatus.  Until the fall.  Yeah, I didn't argue that.  Why are you being combative?  No, I was giving information  to the fans.  No, but you were being combative.  Because it's time to go now.  No, 10.30.  Yeah, well,  by the time you  dilly-dally down there...  True.  If you're not early, 
[03:25:00]  you're not on time.  Not all of us have to be  at the airport  three hours before flight.  I show up seven minutes  before my flight.  That's not the right one.  Seven minutes.  I'm with Kenny.  Plenty.  No.  So the working title's  Best of Trayvon, Sam.  I acknowledge it's  the working title  of the video.  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.  The next working title  is going to be  The Royal Baby.  Okay, you're just taking  things that are topical  news stories  and trying to get  cheap YouTube hits.  No, I need working titles  so I need something  that's like, you know, 
[03:25:30]  easy to remember.  It is just about  the numbers for you, isn't it?  It doesn't matter  if they like it.  It doesn't matter  if they stay.  It doesn't matter.  None of it matters  except the little numbers.  It's like a ticker.  What's wrong with  naming a video  Best of Trayvon  as a working title?  It's a tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  Well, eventually  it'll be the real title.  I'm going to come up  with something a bit clever.  There's no integrity to it.  It's a montage  of the elevator show  and it came out  very, very well  but it's called  Best of Trayvon.  You don't even have  to watch it.  You just have to click on it.  Yeah, I don't care  if you watch it. 
[03:26:00]  Who gives a fuck?  See, like with my stuff  I'd like people to watch it.  Nah, you don't want  them to watch it in the end.  It doesn't matter.  Why don't you discuss  this in the van  on the way to the...  Are you panicking?  They're still at the bank.  I wasn't invited  to take money out  with those guys, so...  Banks don't require invitations.  Oh.  I thought there was  an invite.  They cleaned up  the studio already.  They're really trying  to usher us out.  So click on my  Best of Trayvon video.  It's terrific.  And there is a... 
[03:26:30]  There's...  Who kid's in it  so people think  that might be Trayvon  so that's good.  It's not good.  So it kind of helps  the whole thing.  Look how good  Stacey Keyboard looks.  I wouldn't know  because it's all  about the legs  and you don't even  show the legs.  She's wearing a pantsuit.  I mean, the legs start  right where that console...  She was wearing pants.  ...edges.  To be fair to Roland,  she was wearing full pants.  Why?  Why would you do that  if you got the legs?  I don't know.  It's summer too.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  She wants people  to pay attention to her  instead of her legs?  She's smoking hot.  I would have told her  to take the pants off  before the interview. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  I mean, we have  different interview styles.  Yours is...  I'm not saying get naked.  She probably has  panties on or something.  I would assume.  But it's all about the legs  so she's got to show the legs.  Yeah, I don't think  the interview would have  gone as well  if I'd done that.  All right.  We got to go, I guess.  Yeah.  Best of Trayvon.  OP Radio on YouTube.  Give me some clicks.  And Not Sam as well.  And Club Soda County  on Facebook.  Big ups.  All right.  We're going to see  everyone in Canada tomorrow. 
[03:27:30]  Big Canadian shows.  Roland's packed.  That's his carry-on.  You ready to go?  What a buffoon.  Yeah, but see,  he's here in things right now.  No, you can't.  Oh, that's right.  You're in here now.  No, why didn't you  film her legs?  They're covered.  She was wearing pants.  Yeah, but you filmed her  coming in the studio  or something.  She was just sitting  in the studio.  Waiting for you to arrive?  Yeah.  That's what happens with me. 
[03:28:00]  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  Thanks.  All right.  This is going nowhere  and we have  somewhere to go.  We'll see everybody  tomorrow live from  Montreal,  the Just for Laughs  festival.  The OBNF Show  on Series XM. </pre>
