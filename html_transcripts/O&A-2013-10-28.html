<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and their signature unrestrained style. Opie shared a funny anecdote about babysitting and mimicking breastfeeding.  The conversation then turned to the Jets' loss, and the HBO documentary *Life According to Sam*, about a child with progeria.  The hosts discussed the documentary's emotional impact, their past jokes on the subject, and the ethical considerations of the disease's clinical trials, criticizing Maury Povich's approach to similar sensitive topics.

The death of Lou Reed became the next major topic, with the hosts expressing skepticism towards the perceived insincerity of many tributes, particularly mocking Earl Douglas’s delayed and seemingly insincere tweets.  They played a snippet of Laurie Anderson's "O Superman," expressing their dislike.  The discussion segued into performance art and its perceived pretentiousness. A caller, Dick Frank, defended Lou Reed, sparking a heated debate about his talent and influence, featuring profane language.  A listener recommended the HBO documentary *Redemption* about can collectors; this led to further irreverent commentary.  The hosts also criticized other artists they deemed disappointing after hearing only one hit, including Radiohead and The Pogues.  They played a live version of Lou Reed's "Sweet Jane" with further commentary and listener calls.  The show also briefly mentioned Homeless Mustard's appearance on *The Voice* and social media posts about Bobo.

Connecting with Earl Douglas by phone, the hosts played Lou Reed's "NYC Man," a song Earl had praised, only to derisively critique it.  Earl’s attempts to explain Reed’s significance were repeatedly interrupted by the hosts' mocking.  The poor phone connection added to the comedic frustration.  The conversation then shifted to Reed's commercial endorsements (a Honda scooter ad), his purported influence on punk rock, and the hosts' opinions on the matter. The show then covered allegations of racial profiling at Barney's and Jay-Z's response, with the hosts offering their opinions on Jay-Z and Reverend Al Sharpton's involvement.  The arrest of Dave Herman, a former radio personality, for soliciting sex with a minor, was discussed, focusing on the reaction on the New York Radio Message Board and Earl's angry response, including violent suggestions.  This segment concluded with a call to and in-studio appearance by comedian Brian Regan.

Brian Regan joined the show, and the conversation began with a humorous discussion about assault weapons before moving to Regan's family life, his teenage son's height, and his video game obsession (including a *Skyrim* anecdote).  Regan discussed his relationship with his girlfriend, met at a gathering for comedians following Ron Shock's death.  The hosts and Regan joked about dating and the challenges of touring comedians' relationships.  The conversation shifted to movies, comparing the length of modern films to older ones.  A significant portion focused on Regan's career, including awkward stand-up moments, such as a bombed joke at a children's cancer benefit and a near-silent set at a golf club. He also discussed his experience as a radio producer in a Chris Rock film and his dislike of acting.  Comedian Tim Conway then joined the show.

The Tim Conway interview was highly antagonistic and comedically abrasive. Conway was uncooperative, sarcastic, and dismissive, creating a tense yet humorous dynamic. He made comments about being a "mean little bastard."  The hosts mentioned his book, *My Life as a Horrible Person*, and upcoming book signings.  A photo of Conway with Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence was discussed, prompting negative comments from Conway.  Immediately following, Nick Offerman was interviewed.  The hosts described the Conway interview as "amazing" and "hilarious." Offerman, in contrast, was cooperative, discussing his book, *Paddle Your Own Canoe*, his career, including *Parks and Recreation*, his views on acting, his wife Megan Mullally and her band, his appreciation for Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed, his woodworking project "Meat Fight," and his website, OffermanWoodShop.com.  The hosts noted similarities between Offerman's demeanor and Ron Swanson, highlighting a surprising giggle.  The conversation included topics like smoking on airplanes, television comedy, and Offerman's theater experiences.  A voice comparison with Christian Bale and Charlie Sheen was made, along with anecdotes about a Vietnam-era DJ, Dave Rabbit, and the hosts' experiences with smoking and filmmaking.

The final segment focused on scheduling of *Parks and Rec* episodes and a rambling discussion of the Tim Conway interview.  The hosts discussed DJ Who Kid's photograph with the *Carol Burnett Show* cast (holding a baseball bat), and debated the definition of "gangster." A caller compared the awkwardness of the Tim Conway and Jenna Jameson interviews; the hosts recounted humorous stories from their encounter with Conway, emphasizing his apparent disorientation and age.  The conversation shifted to DJ Who Kid's toy collection and his decision to downsize it, leading to humorous speculation about the correlation between a clean house and sexual satisfaction.  The hosts and DJ Who Kid engaged in sexually explicit banter.  The discussion then turned to E-Rock's radio nerdery and his creation of a montage from old air checks. The show concluded with a commercial for Russell Peters' Netflix special, "Notorious."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Look at that.  It's Monday.  Everyone have a nice weekend, I hope.  I don't know if it was a nice weekend.  I had a babysit for two days.  Well, now, this is where you got in trouble. 
[00:01:30]  A babysat for two days.  With the Twitter people and everything.  They say.  The Twitter people.  They say you're not babysitting.  It's your kid.  You're not babysitting.  Ah, parents understand.  If you're a parent, you understand.  Sometimes you're a father and sometimes you're just watching the clock and babysitting.  Ah.  I had both kids for the whole weekend.  How'd that work out for you?  It was all right.  I don't have any real stories, to be honest with you.  Got any sleep?  Um, not really.  No, huh?  Not really.  Because the young one still gets up a few times during the night. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, just go to sleep.  And I don't have the tit-tay.  You don't have the tit-tay?  I don't have the tit-tay.  But she's in the middle of, like, breastfeeding and bottles.  So I took the bottle.  And at one point, it was kind of weird.  I had to kind of, like, cradle her like this.  And then kind of put the bottle like it might be a tit-tay.  How do they know where you're putting it?  It's just like...  It must be the position she's used to.  So I was able to trick her. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And then she drank the milk and crashed and blah, blah, blah.  Did you say April Fowles?  No April Fowles.  You can't judge her for making that mistake.  You know, even in adulthood, people make gender errors at times.  It's certainly understandable how the youngster would be confused.  Then I waited all day for the Jets game.  That was my one excitement for the weekend.  Yeah.  And they got fucking blown out.  Oh, is that what happened?  You didn't watch.  I didn't watch.  They were your team, I thought.  But, you know, I wasn't bleeding Jets green this weekend. 
[00:03:00]  No.  No.  49-9, I guess, was the final.  I gave up at halftime.  I knew this was a bust.  Jets are having a schizo year.  Win one, lose one.  Win one, lose one.  Win one, lose one.  Did the Giants play?  Yeah, the Giants beat the Eagles.  Oh, they finally won.  I think they got two wins in a row now, the Giants.  They're making a run at mediocrity.  Oh, good for them.  Go for them.  And then I just was telling you, and we should talk about it on the air a little bit, I saw  that damn fucking HBO documentary, Life According to Sam, because of you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  The little progeria kids.  And we've had our fun with the progeria thing over the years.  Well, we sure have, you know, because, yeah, I'm just a regular kid.  That's pretty much it.  The Sam kid.  My God.  It was a pretty good documentary.  Yeah, I had some tears.  It was pretty amazing.  You're watching, you're just like, oh, man.  You know, and it's the old typical thing that everybody says.  You know, you bitch about things in your life, and you don't realize how good you have it. 
[00:04:00]  And you see this fucking kid who's, you know, his life expectancy is like a mayfly.  12 or 13.  And he's all fucked up.  You know, he's got arthritis and cardiovascular problems, all kinds of shit that goes along  with old age.  Not a hint of a hair on his head.  Oh, my God.  A nose like a fucking eagle's beak.  Giant noses on the progeria kids.  I know.  It's amazing.  Proving that.  Yeah, that shit continues growing your entire life.  And then, and he's totally fucking cool with it.  You know?  He's a cool kid. 
[00:04:30]  I was telling Anthony, you know, we bitching and complaining about the PC shit.  But the PC stuff does help in some ways.  Yeah.  Uh, they showed the kid, Sam, at his school, walking the hallways.  Everyone's high-fiving him, saying, hey, Sam.  And, of course, the documentary cameras are filming, so you're going to be a little cooler.  But you could kind of read between the lines and realize that he's completely accepted at  school.  Yeah.  And if we had a progeria kid when we were growing up, he would not be accepted.  You don't think so, huh?  No.  Yeah, it would have been weird. 
[00:05:00]  So I like that that type of thing, I guess, has changed a bit.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he's, like, rattling off all his friends that have died, because basically  he knows every progeria kid in the world.  It's kind of like...  There's only, like, 250 of them or something.  It's kind of like if you drive a black SUV, you know all the other black SUVs.  Oh, I've got to wave to this guy, because he has the same car as me.  And progeria is the same way.  If you've got it, you've got to...  I guess you've got to know every progeria kid in the world.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, is 250.  That's it.  There's only 250 progeria kids in the world. 
[00:05:30]  In the world.  And, you know, you were talking about this documentary last week, and I quickly...  I really had to watch it, because I...  Some of the stuff you said, now I want to discuss really fast.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you not give the drug to every single kid?  I know.  Isn't it?  It really isn't...  I know they have their rules and stuff, but you're talking about 250 kids where it's guaranteed  they're going to die by...  I want to say 20, but that would be amazing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Most of them are going to die at 15 years old. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Even 15 would be amazing.  Yeah.  So what do they have to lose, especially if the parents are willing to sign away their rights?  Yeah.  It really is an exceptional circumstance that they should take into consideration.  But they treat it like every other drug that has to go through all the motions and the  process, which takes years and...  You've got to get your paper published.  Yes.  You've got to get your paper published.  It's such a weird thing.  And they might deny your paper, and that means it could be over, but this mom was not going  to take no for an answer. 
[00:06:30]  And there's a protocol of test subjects that have to take placebos.  And you would do that if it's an illness that people have time for, but they don't have  time.  Yeah.  This mom's like, look, I'm in charge of this whole thing.  I can't do the placebo.  Yeah.  I can't have...  I think it was, what, 16 in the trial?  Yeah, yeah.  16 kids.  I can't have a few of these kids with the placebo.  Choose eight kids that you know you're just pretty much sentencing to death.  Half and half the placebo thing? 
[00:07:00]  I'm pretty sure they do half and half with the placebo, yeah.  So that was emotional in the movie, because she knew that was going to fuck up her paper,  because usually you need the placebo, and she's like, I can't do the placebo, because  I really think this one drug that we're testing is going to help in some way.  Yep.  You know?  Yeah, it's not a cure, obviously, but it's a viable treatment.  Right.  But Sam's a cool kid.  It was good.  Yeah.  He's rattling off the names of everyone he's known that has died.  He's too young to know that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And at school, you know, helping out other kids and stuff. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  It was just, it's weird, because you look at them, and you don't know what to make of  it, because there's been so little information about these little fuckers.  Right.  And then you see them talking about things, and you realize, it's like, wow, you know,  how the fuck do you even get past the fact that you have a disease that 250 people have  in the whole world?  And then why would you...  And not just sit there and curse this supposed god.  What I was amazed at is, they show him in school trying, and then, I don't want to give 
[00:08:00]  a lot of the documentary away, I mean, the basic stuff, I guess we can, wins all sorts  of awards at the end of the school year.  I'm like, what?  I would have just sat there.  Yeah, really?  Just sit.  Especially in the classes you have no interest in.  Why would you try at that?  Yeah.  Did you say mean things when you felt emotional?  I would always do that if I felt emotional, just say mean, inappropriate things so I don't  cry.  Like, ah, you little fucking Star Trek alien head kid.  Yeah, just say the tears don't come, you say something awful. 
[00:08:30]  No, I don't mind.  I don't mind getting a little teary-eyed every once in a while.  I just tighten my nipple clamps.  It is weird, though.  And you realize, you're like, look, and we've had him on the show a few times, you realize  how totally despicable Maury Povich is.  Let's play Maury on this one.  What an awful human being Maury is.  I mean, oh, sure, we've had our share of bashing little progeria kids on this show, but we've  never gone under the guise of helping or educating people or anything, which is what Maury does 
[00:09:00]  when he has him on.  But meanwhile, with Maury, it's a fucking hurry, hurry, hurry.  Oh, it's a sideshow.  Give us your nickels.  See the little old man, kid.  But then he gives him, like, a gift certificate for Fridays or something, and then it's okay  at the end.  Yeah, exactly.  You and your family are going to eat at Fridays.  You're going to have some stuffed cheese, bacon, potato skins to really clog up your heart.  That's so he can go home and sleep at night.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know, man.  I love this freaking documentary, Life According to Sam.  It's winning all sorts of awards.  I guess the kid is doing some promotion.  He's playing with little Legos.  Just like fucking our own E-Rock.  I think you gave it away, and I think I just gave it away as well.  You know, I was wondering if he was going to be dead at the end of this movie.  I know, yeah, yeah.  But you kind of gave that away last week, which was fine.  It didn't blow the movie for me at all.  Yeah.  And now he's like 17 years old.  That's crazy.  Yeah, I'd have felt really bad.  Like, I was waiting for the end of the movie, and I saw they put some text up on the screen 
[00:10:00]  at the end to see what happened with some of these other kids and everything.  And I was just, I was cringing.  I'm going, uh-oh, uh-oh.  And it's like, oh, he's celebrating a birthday.  Okay.  All right.  That's pretty good.  And he loves Dave Matthews.  I guess I've got to fault him for that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Out of every band.  I mean, you've got Progeria.  They're going to allow you backstage.  Why would you pick Dave Matthews?  That's the only fault I have with this kid. 
[00:10:30]  He loves Dave Matthews.  And we've done some things with Dave Matthews over the years.  He's a good guy in the bands, and they're fine.  But I'm thinking, you could be backstage with the Rolling Stones or Paul McCartney.  They're not going to say no to you.  Especially when you wear a baseball cap.  We should interview him and just scream at him for his bad musical choices.  You suck.  He loves Dave Matthews.  His father loves Dave Matthews.  And the band was all night.  They dedicate a song to him.  The one part of the movie where the father was like, you know, I guess I've got to admit 
[00:11:00]  I'm meeting Dave Matthews because of my son.  But I guess at this point I should admit that, you know, I would never, I would be okay with  never meeting Dave Matthews if my kid was healthy.  Yeah.  My Progeria kid's a real pussy magnet.  Bring him around.  He's better than a kitten.  Bring him to the store.  The chicks start talking to me.  And then the other thing is he plays, you know, baseball.  They give him the worst position.  Why is he the catcher?  I know, right?  Well, he'd probably want as much padding on him as possible. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  That seems like a horrendous position to play if you've got Progeria.  Yeah.  How many people still second?  Probably everyone that gets up.  And that's the 43rd steal of the inning.  He just walks a second.  And the kid breaks two ribs on an easy ride at Disney.  I know.  He's like on the Dumbo ride and he breaks two ribs.  So, I don't know.  This movie was great.  It's so well done.  It looks good.  Like, there's only so much you could do with a documentary as far as the cinematography 
[00:12:00]  of it goes.  But it really, it looked good.  It really shows.  And pretty quickly.  You know, it's not all that long of a film.  An hour and a half.  It shows pretty quickly what these kids and their parents are about and stuff.  And the mom.  Oh, my God.  The mom especially.  She is pretty driven.  Well, if you don't know, Sam's parents are both doctors.  Yeah.  And the mom pretty much blew off what she was doing before this and set up a whole progeria  foundation and went all in to try to figure this shit out to try to, you know, get these 
[00:12:30]  kids living a little longer at the very least.  Did you see what a fucking just one in a billion shot it is at even getting it?  Like how they.  And they didn't go in depth into the genetics of the whole thing, but they just gave you  enough of an example for you to realize how completely like random this is.  Right.  Yeah.  That's why I'm going to go with it again.  Giant microscopes.  Blow all that shit up and you'll know exactly what's going on.  You need that shit.  And just pluck that stupid one out.  The size of a big fucking television on your wall. 
[00:13:00]  Giant.  It's got to be giant.  There it is.  Suck that fucking thing out.  And then just take that little piece that started that domino effect.  Yeah.  That's a pretty good one, though.  A lot of awards.  Yeah.  I liked it a lot.  Yeah.  Good.  From the Academy Awards.  Where can you see it?  Huh?  Netflix?  It's on HBO.  I think it's on HBO.  HBO has the best documentary.  This thing is everywhere.  Great documentary is HBO.  Best fucking documentary.  This is being written in.  Every paper is writing about this life according to Sam. 
[00:13:30]  I mean, every single paper.  And then when all the kids get together for the trial and you got like.  Oh, yeah.  The Indian version.  Which is weird.  The Italian version.  Because Pageria kids, for the most part, they look very similar.  They got the giant head, the big schnozzola, the giant round eyes and everything.  But then there's these little ethnic versions of the Pageria kids.  So you could see like the Indian kid looked like kind of an Indian kid.  I want to collect them all.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  I want to collect them all.  Collect the whole set.  He didn't play baseball.  He was just the umpire.  I thought he was catching.  Oh, was he umping?  Didn't it look like he was catching?  It looked like he was catching.  He was catching.  Yeah.  Was there another catcher in front of him?  Because then there was another ump behind him.  Wasn't a Pageria kid.  Whoa.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Maybe I got that part of it wrong.  I don't know.  See the little harness he's got to wear with his drum?  Yeah.  The crazy harness.  It's got to distribute weight over his whole fucking skeleton. 
[00:14:30]  Or something will crack.  Nothing's stopping the kid.  His little fucking collarbones.  Right.  Those tiny little collarbones.  And then I took a suggestion from a listener.  Because you've got to watch Redemption on HBO.  Did you watch Redemption?  It's a half hour.  It's too short.  And it's really.  It's such an easy movie to make.  I mean, nothing against the filmmakers.  But it was.  Basically, it's all the people in New York that collect cans for a living.  Oh, right.  I didn't see that one.  And it's only a half hour. 
[00:15:00]  And it could have been done way the fuck better, I think.  Yeah.  It was filmed nicely, though.  And they, you know, they kind of, you know, look into some of the lives of the people  that have decided that, you know, they need to collect cans to survive.  The bums!  Do they make money?  They make, uh, they make money, I guess.  I mean, you know.  How much for a can?  Five cents, I think.  Per can?  Yeah.  And they have bags and bags of them.  But I don't think it's more than a hundred bucks a day, maybe. 
[00:15:30]  If you go to Michigan, they're ten cents.  Oh, so why would you, you should go to Michigan then?  Best cans, though.  Well, it's everything.  Cans and bottles.  Oh.  So you should, like, load up a fucking truck.  Right.  With the five-cent deposits.  And then drive it to Michigan.  Now you're talking.  And you're getting ten cents on it if you could figure out the balance between gas and, uh.  Sure.  Or do it on a plane.  And go on to.  Just book a flight.  Yeah.  And then have a few extra little things.  It was all right. 
[00:16:00]  You got the Chinese lady that's, uh, just a real cocksucker out there.  There's an old lady that used to work for, like, IBM or something and won awards as a salesperson.  And now she's collecting cans.  Really?  Of course you're going to get that type of story in a movie like this.  And she's on her corner.  She's pretty old.  And the Chinese lady is just aggressive as all hell.  Oh, really?  And everyone has their territory and their bags.  Like, if you've got, you know, if you're the one going into this one fucking garbage, it's yours.  Not the Chinese lady's fucked that shit.  And she's yanking the.  Muscles in? 
[00:16:30]  Muscles in.  And now the old lady's trying to fight her territory out there with the monsters.  But they just touched.  There's probably bugs all over these fucking roaches and ants.  We got.  All over these cans and bees in the summer.  Oh.  We got a couple people in our neighborhood, Jimmy.  Every week they go out there.  But they have it figured out.  They got their own bags.  And they got gloves on.  And they just aggressively go through the garbage really, really fast.  And then they tie the garbage back up so there's no mess on the sidewalk. 
[00:17:00]  Because they know if they start leaving messes, that's going to be a problem.  And they're not going to be able to go back to that particular building.  And in the movie, there's one block where there's 20 people alone that are collecting cans.  So, yeah, that was depressing.  That's a mom with her two kids out there.  That's how she's feeding her kids.  She should sell that ass.  Wow.  Wow.  We all waved that.  Like, it was funny, but it was also, like, well, a good point.  A little tragic and a good point. 
[00:17:30]  Tragic and valid economic advice.  It was all right.  Yeah.  Redemption was a good idea, but.  I hadn't seen that one.  It was too quick.  I do like me a good documentary.  I can't get enough of the documentaries.  And there's nothing worse than a documentary that doesn't have a good conclusion.  And I mean good, like a solid conclusion.  Right, right.  I saw one recently.  Open-ended.  Yeah, and I was like, it wasn't that great.  And it's disappointing when a documentary sucks.  Sure.  Yeah, it's like you've got to kind of wait for this to play out before you make a documentary on it, you fuckwad. 
[00:18:00]  Was there a Seinfeld reference in there?  Huh?  Did you do a Seinfeld reference?  No.  Okay.  Why?  Someone on the phones.  I'm like, I don't think I heard any.  He's gone now.  I don't know.  Everybody's all fucking, you know.  We're all on high alert.  Ready to jump on it.  Some guy said that you made another Seinfeld reference in there.  No, I'm like, I don't think so.  Iraq, comment?  Yeah, I thought you did too.  Really?  Where'd you think it was?  With the cans where Kramer and Newman are in the postal truck. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, you wanted to leave it at that?  Thanks, Iraq.  So that's your new bit to deny it now?  Just deny it.  I will not admit to it now.  You can't blame Iraq on that one.  Iraq ratted me up.  Oh, wait, that really was a Seinfeld?  Yes.  Wait, which one?  Well, Kramer and Newman.  Right.  Well, Kramer had tried it earlier, taking the five-cent depositable bottles to Michigan  for ten cents.  Oh, fuck, of course.  For ten cents.  All right.  And he just can't work. 
[00:19:00]  The economics don't work out because you use all your overhead is on the gas and get  in the truck and everything to take it.  So Newman realized during one of these holidays, like Mother's Day or something, he gets extra  time with his mail truck and stuff, and he could use his mail truck and use that, and  now they won't have to pay for a truck or gas and load it up and go to Michigan.  And they figured out the numbers, and it worked perfectly, until Kramer spotted Jerry's stolen 
[00:19:30]  car with the John F. Kennedy golf clubs in the back and decided to follow him to help  Jerry out, and they got off course and screwed the whole thing up.  I think actually, yeah, that was a bad one.  Oh, man, I should have got that one.  Maybe not, though.  That was clever.  I didn't delve into it too deeply.  I just figured I'd leave it there.  You know, you rock ratted me out.  Yeah, but then you get the explanation with the music.  It's beautiful. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, with the nice music.  It felt morning zoo-ish.  It was kind of nice.  It really did.  I liked it.  And then a lot of people pretending that they loved Lou Reed this weekend.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  A lot of people pretending.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  I hear you.  Unless you're Ronnie B and a handful of other people, stop pretending Lou Reed was so great  in your life.  Yes.  Stop it.  Now, you bring up a good point.  I know two songs, I think.  Yeah.  Walking the Wild Side and I'll Go Sweet Jane. 
[00:20:30]  Do you know a third Lou Reed song?  No.  The Satellite song, right?  Yeah.  That's him, isn't it?  That's him.  I guess.  Is it?  Supposedly.  Satellite of Love?  Yeah, that's Lou Reed.  How's the Satellite of Love?  Is that the one Ron Perry played at the end?  That's a good song.  Yeah, that's a good song.  It's Ronnie's song.  Ronnie will have a lot to say about Lou Reed.  Ron Bennington knows Lou Reed.  Listen to this.  He just talked.  He talked.  He didn't sing at all.  He's tone deaf. 
[00:21:00]  Sweet Jane.  I like the songs that I've heard.  I like this.  And nobody said he was a great singer.  I just heard this morning on the news, oh, he was amazing.  He had a great voice.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All I'm saying, there are people out there, but in general, everyone jumped on the old  bandwagon and made believe that they loved Lou Reed more than they did.  Exactly.  That's all I'm saying.  This is a good song.  He was very influential, I guess. 
[00:21:30]  I don't even know.  I guess people liked him.  Velvet Underground was a huge influential band.  I think it's very hip to say that you liked him and were influenced by him.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  That's it.  The early 70s.  I was reading something about him.  It's the early 70s.  A couple of his albums in the early 70s were supposed to be brilliant, but I never got into  them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This song I like and the other two.  I heard he was brilliant.  I don't know why, and I don't really know a lot of his songs, except for the hits that  I played on the radio over the years. 
[00:22:00]  And did you know that he married Laurie Anderson in 2008?  Who's she?  She's that performance artist that had that one hit way in the, I think in the early  to mid 80s, Superman.  What?  I think it was even on MTV, the video.  Really?  Let me see.  You know the song, and you're not going to like it.  This thing?  Oh.  Of course.  Of course he married her.  Lou Reed married. 
[00:22:30]  You remember this?  I remember the.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, John.  Oh, imagine these two assholes talking to each other.  It's just mean.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's just a performance artist.  And this was on MTV.  I do remember this.  You do, right?  So they got married in 2008.  2008. I was waiting for a good video to play. No, this is all it is. Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  How fucking annoying is this? Nice. No, it's not.  You don't want to dance this? No. I do.  Doesn't get much better. How much, how much longer?  Yeah. Seven minutes, seven and a half minutes. Holy fuck. And it never kicks in.  I'm not home right now, but if you want to leave a message, just start talking at the sound of the tone. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, God. Pretentious fucking horse shit.  Hello? This is your mother. Are you there? Are you coming home?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I fucking... This is like a torture. I don't mind the beat behind it, but what she's putting in front of it is fairly awful. 
[00:24:00]  Is anybody home?  What is that? What is that?  Well, you don't know me.  Oh, she's got a light in her mouth now. This is great.  Do you think this is just music to get high to?  Yes, this is some type of drug shit.  The beauty of a radio show. There's got to be one lousy fucking person out there that could explain this to us.  What is performance art? Why is it important? And why do we know the name Laurie Anderson? 
[00:24:30]  I didn't know her name.  Well, you know the song, though, from MTV.  See that other performance art piece over the weekend of the lady that got jizzed on on the train, and she has a sign about how she got jizzed on on a train, and then she stands in front of the train with the sign and does a performance piece.  Oh, it's terrible.  Performance art's weird. Like, a lot of them are just people who aren't good enough to perform in clubs. 
[00:25:00]  And instead of admitting, wow, I'm just not good enough, they make it look like they're such geniuses and nobody got them.  And then there are performance artists that are bringing something that's really different and brilliant to the table that, honestly, crowds don't really...  Right.  It's hard to sell to regular crowds, so...  I don't mind this, but I wouldn't, like, search it out, if that makes sense. I wouldn't go see Laurie Anderson.  Not only do I mind this, it hurts me.  It's like, it's a physical pain that it's inflicting. 
[00:25:30]  There's no reason to be this annoyed with something that you're supposed to...  That's unimportant.  Yes.  Alright.  This.  Or Yoko Ono.  Oh, you gotta take this.  Okay, good.  But I would take anything over that Yoko shit.  This didn't ruin the Beatles.  Yeah.  Oh, Dirty Boulevard, I know, as well. Thank you, Pat, Stan Allen. 
[00:26:00]  Talking about Lou Reed right now.  We know Dirty Boulevard.  I don't know Dirty Boulevard.  Give us a little Dirty Boulevard.  So, anyway, Lou Reed married Laurie Anderson. I did not know that.  Go for him.  Reading up on Lou Reed this weekend.  And he was a dick, too.  Well, from people who had met him.  Sure.  That has been said.  That he was.  And he got a new liver in May.  How'd that work out for him?  Well, at the time, Lou Reed Anderson said he was dying.  He needed the liver.  Yeah.  What did he die of, by the way?  I'm not saying yet. 
[00:26:30]  I thought I heard on the news this morning it was complications from the liver thing.  From the liver thing.  Oh, yeah.  What did he, like, have fucking hep or something?  And that's an update.  This is a cool song.  No?  Turn this up.  No.  More talking.  He's got nine brothers and sisters.  They're brought up on their knees.  It's hard to run.  Their coat hanger beats you on the thighs.  Pedro dreams of being older.  And killing the old man.  But that's a slim chance. 
[00:27:00]  He's going to the boulevard.  Oh.  He's going to end up.  On the dirty boulevard.  He's going out.  He's going out.  To the dirty boulevard.  He's going out.  To the dirty boulevard.  This isn't singing.  I'm sure if you listen to Ron Fez later, you will hear the most obscure fucking Lou Reed song at the beginning of the show.  That you've never, ever heard in your life.  Lou Reed.  Ronnie will do the whole Lou Reed thing justice. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  He'll do it justice.  Oh, he really will.  If you're a fan.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He's a bandwagon Lou Reed fan.  He just jumped on.  He's popular.  And then people are saying Lou Reed performed with Metallica recently.  Yes, they did a song or a record together.  How long ago?  Last year or two years ago.  Yeah, I don't know that either.  Yeah, no, I remember here.  We played it.  We talked about it on the show.  Lou Reed and Metallica?  Yep.  I don't remember what it is, but we did talk about it.  They did a song with him. 
[00:28:00]  What song did Lou Reed do with Metallica?  I'm sure somebody on Twitter will accuse me of reading that and then trying to act like I just knew it.  And can we read Black Earl's tweets on Lou Reed?  They're terrific, by the way.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I'm never sure if an artist is really dead until I get the confirmation from Earl.  Depressing Earl's Twitter feed.  We lost another one.  Lost another one today.  The chorus of the voices that gather up the magnets.  Oh, God. 
[00:28:30]  He makes Metallica suck.  I attract you and repel you.  A science of the heart.  It's no different than when Shatner does it.  And Lou Reed is a shoehorned motherfucker with lyrics.  And in a coffin, your soul's shaking.  I want to have you downing every meaning of a mess like a fortune. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, throw it away.  But worship someone who has...  So that's kind of a spoken voice it is.  Yeah, just a word with some music behind it.  A singer who can't fucking sing.  Amazing.  A very distinct voice, though.  Yeah.  Oh, he sounds good now, though.  Could you keep going, James, please?  What a great voice, huh? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, he's fucking awesome, Hetfield.  I'm back to old chit-chatty fucking Lou Reed.  He looks like Joe Piscopo.  Club Piscopo.  This is drivel.  Too cool for the room, crap.  Yeah.  People who listen to this don't like it.  They just like to say that they fucking listen to it. 
[00:30:00]  Where's Hetfield?  Come on, James.  Help us out.  What a powerful fucking voice Hetfield has.  Yeah.  You realize, like, that's who should be fronting a band.  I am the view.  I am the table.  I am the view.  I am the table.  I am all this.  I am the root.  The progress.  The aggressor.  What?  Are you?  I am the view. 
[00:30:30]  I am the table.  What the fuck are you saying?  I am the table.  The music's cool.  Of course.  Let me get fucking Lou Reed yapping over the whole thing.  You don't like Lou Reed?  I am yapping. 
[00:31:00]  I gotta say, I don't mind this.  I don't mind this.  It's starting to grow on me a little bit.  I don't like Lou Reed's part.  Lou Reed's dumb talking shit.  Yeah.  I don't mind it.  Like, when Jim Morrison did it, it didn't bother me.  I enjoyed his spoken word stuff they put music to.  Because I know Jim Morrison did sick.  So when he did it, it was like a guy, an artist, just kind of departing.  Like, Lou Reed's just kind of irritating.  Yeah, Lou Reed's irritating.  All right, Lou. 
[00:31:30]  What year was this?  Like, 90s?  No, it's just very recent.  Like, a couple years ago.  Really?  Yep.  The video looks very 90s.  All right.  I think they were going for a Johnny Cash thing there.  I knew this was going to happen.  We got the Defenders now.  Okay.  Dick Frank in New York.  Dick Frank.  I guess.  Is that really your name?  What's happening, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hi, Dick.  Yeah, thanks.  75, rock and roll animal.  Best live album ever made. 
[00:32:00]  All right, 75, rock and roll animal.  Do we have anything off that album?  What's the big song off there?  Sweet Cane, Heroin.  Of course.  It's a Don't Shooters album.  You know what I'm saying?  But do you really think Lou Reed's a good singer?  No, but the music was incredible.  Okay.  He had Stephen Hunter and Ian Hunter on the album.  It was like a whole Montauro thing.  It was really good music, you know?  All right.  I wonder what it is about Lou Reed.  I mean, I'm not going to say the guy sucks.  He's obviously influenced a lot of people.  But what is it about him that just grabs people? 
[00:32:30]  He was a city minstrel guy, man.  He was a...  He was a...  I hate that shit.  Wait, wait, wait.  A city minstrel guy.  What does that mean?  Oh, he's like wandering around the city sharing his fucking craft.  Oh, shut it.  See?  You fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself with Lou Reed's dead dick.  Jesus, man.  What the fuck? 
[00:33:00]  Kester, you're the funniest fucking guy ever, man.  Of course I am.  What the fuck?  Guy loves his Lou Reed.  You don't like that he walks around the city and he might see things that we can't possibly see ourselves?  Of course.  Of course not.  Finding art in the simplicity of people.  Yes, we don't have the fucking ability.  We just see a street and maybe a couple people walking around, but he sees a lot more.  Of course.  He sees life in those dark areas.  That's right.  He's showing everybody.  He understands the people. 
[00:33:30]  Ugh.  Because you know what?  He takes that walk on the...  Oh, wild side.  Yes, he does.  He dared to go places we wouldn't...  Oh, and the colored girls go do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  You gotta love this one.  No, I don't have to.  You don't even like this one?  Jackie came from Miami, FLA.  Hey.  Hey.  So it sounds like he's constantly trying to find the note.  From Miami, FLA.  Hey. 
[00:34:00]  Hitchhiked away across the USA.  Hey.  Plucked her eyebrows on the way.  Shaved her legs and then he was a she.  She says, hey, babe.  I can't stand...  A little tranny action.  Yeah, exactly.  Respect, Lou.  Way to go, Lou.  Attaboy, Lou.  Pioneer.  God.  This is enjoyable, though.  No. 
[00:34:30]  Islands.  It's terrible.  But she never lost her head, even when she was given...  Oh, tee-hee-hee!  Can you pause there?  It's a little rough when you rhyme head with head, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's a genius.  Can you go back to that line?  Well, senior editor of Rolling Stone magazine.  No, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  He made art on his own terms and lived life on his own terms.  He didn't really care about the commercial success, either, did he? 
[00:35:00]  That's true, yeah.  He constantly challenged conventions, whether it was experimenting with the garbage bag or  giving a voice to gay people and transgender people in the audience.  At a time when that was really terrible.  I'm challenging convention.  Why is he so influential?  Where do we see his influence?  Well, you can see Lou Reed's influence on a number of artists who have cited him specifically  as an influence.  People like Patti Smith, R.E.M., The Strokes.  But beyond that, you can really see his influence on virtually anyone today who we consider  to be a new rock, punk rock, alt rock.  The one and done band, The Strokes.  The way he's at challenge conventions and did things his own way is a huge example for 
[00:35:30]  a generation of stars.  First of all, I haven't heard one example of Lou Reed and punk.  They talk about how he's the fucking pioneer godfather of punk.  I haven't heard one example of a punk song out of this motherfucker.  Steven Tyler in his tweet referenced Max's.  That's Max's, Kansas City.  It was a salon effect.  It was a bar here in New York City.  Steven Tyler's an idiot, too.  Artists made it into just like an idea factory.  Not for him.  There's rambling nonsense when he talks.  And he would often say that the music has to mean something. 
[00:36:00]  You can't even fucking understand what he's saying.  Then really it loses its value and becomes a commodity.  And that's rare.  That's rare.  Yeah, that's absolutely true.  Well, Lou Reed was certainly an activist.  Looks like a big bitch doesn't like Lou Reed.  He was also an artist, as you mentioned.  He was very close to Andy Warhol.  He was one of the first examples of someone who showed that rock music and high art could kind  of be one and the same.  And also the longevity, too.  Not just of his musical career, but as you said, the philanthropy, the activism.  They were still playing doo-doo-doo-doo-doo on the radio.  What longevity! 
[00:36:30]  I understand he was a big fan of our guy, of Kanye.  That's right, yeah.  Which is interesting because that's such a juxtaposition in a way.  The black lady has to bring in that.  Actually, that's right.  Just a couple of months ago, Lou Reed wrote a really eloquent review about why he loved Kanye West's  most recent album.  And that might have surprised some people, but I think it actually made sense.  But like Lou Reed, Kanye is someone who challenges conventions, someone who does things his own  way.  And I think that's, you know, Lou Reed kind of saw a kindred spirit there.  What was his, we know his interest on music, but what has he been doing later in life?  Was he infaling health for a long period of time? 
[00:37:00]  Do we know?  Well, he had a liver transplant this May, so we know that his health wasn't great.  But he actually, you know, he remained active.  Like I said, he published that Kanye West review just a couple of months ago.  He made public statements.  So this is certainly a surprise and a shock to everyone.  Well, it was really great for you to join us.  You know, I didn't want commercial success.  That's such bullshit.  I'm sorry.  You want another song like Wild Side.  I guarantee it.  Stop it.  I hate when they make believe they don't want the commercial success.  You might want to do a lot of things with your talent, but you definitely want, you know, 
[00:37:30]  the masses to hear your shit.  Right?  There are guys not willing to sell out for commercial success, but you don't, there's  no one makes a song and doesn't want it to be successful.  That's a lie.  What?  They look at the numbers and go, oh, thank God no one's buying this because I don't  want commercial success.  Please don't listen to this.  They throw a party when it's a commercial failure.  When it's a flop.  Shut the fuck up.  This is just what I was looking for.  Or is that how you spin things because you're not getting the commercial success and then 
[00:38:00]  you become cool for not having commercial success.  Then you use words like challenging convention.  Yes.  Eclectic.  Right.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what, to be honest.  You want commercial success so you can do those other things.  If they said they didn't have commercial success and he was okay with that and he didn't  change what he did to get commercial success, that's probably fair.  Yeah.  Like he didn't try to whore himself to get it.  Right.  Fair, but don't act like he didn't want it.  No, he wanted it.  Of course.  But he wasn't going to, you know, yeah.  Jimmy said it very, very well right there. 
[00:38:30]  Yes, exactly.  There's a, it's a fine balance.  Yeah.  I want to hear Sweet Jane from Rock and Roll Animal, which is right here.  Sam has it.  You're not going to like it though.  I want to hear what live sounds like.  Can you try to have an open mind?  I'll have an open mind because this guy said, you got to listen.  The guy that called before said, you got to listen to Rock and Roll Animal, best live  album ever.  Ever!  What about Peter Frampton Comes Alive?  Exactly.  That's voted number one all the time.  That's six. 
[00:39:00]  I hate that record.  No?  I don't know if he's...  It's shit.  Reunion is much better.  Yeah?  Yeah, that will annoy people.  All right.  Let's hear a little Sweet Jane.  Could go to break with this.  No!  I want to be able to say how much it sucks. 
[00:39:30]  Let's hear a little.  All right.  See if live, they punk it up a little more.  A little volume on that?  It's a little low.  Oh. 
[00:40:00]  Jam out a little at first.  Jam out.  I don't like that.  That's a nice sound.  It is a nice sound.  All right.  I'll give the band props.  I kind of like the way that sounds.  Doesn't sound like Lou Reed.  Lou will come in and, you know, destroy the song.  Sounds very of the time. 
[00:40:30]  Sounds very of the time.  Sounds like Peter Frampton.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this.  For reals, yo. 
[00:41:00]  Getting your groove, yo.  I like this.  I like this.  I like this.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  All right.  Where is it?  Where's it coming?  He's doing H backstage right now, man.  Is that it?  Yeah.  All right.  Can they start with the singing?  What the fuck?  What?  Relax. 
[00:41:30]  Everyone's in a hurry these days.  Oh, yeah.  Just relax a little bit.  Got time for this shit.  Why?  Don't you hear it building?  It's nice.  This is good stuff.  Uh-huh.  There we go.  This has a very familiar sound.  I'm trying to figure it out, but I can't.  It's been around forever. 
[00:42:00]  Here we go.  Almost a who thing going on there.  There.  All right.  Here it comes.  Coming around.  No.  Oh, boy.  I thought we were coming around. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  I mean, musically, I like this.  It's amazing.  It's very good.  It really is amazing.  I don't think I've ever heard this.  Like, they're very talented musicians.  I don't think I've ever heard the live version of Sweet Jane before.  There is a who thing going on with this.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's kind of a who sound.  What year is this?  I don't know.  90s? 
[00:43:00]  No.  This is earlier than that.  70s.  70s.  Here we go.  Now they're like, oh.  Marie just walked out.  1975.  Marie just walked out, everyone.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Those claps were dubbed in later, by the way.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then on the corner.  Oh.  Oh.  If this wasn't Lou Reed, you'd say, this sucks. 
[00:43:30]  You'd be like, this singer is terrible.  Get a new singer.  Yeah, but there was a point it wasn't really Lou Reed yet.  So, what happened then?  The assholes liked him, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, finally heard him sing.  That's wonderful.  It's only half over.  Man.  Keep going, no?  I wouldn't.  No?  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't.  There we go.  Let's do Matt in Tennessee right here.  Matt, what's going on, buddy? 
[00:44:30]  Not much, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I saw Mr. Lou Reed about two years ago, and he played, I asked my Lou Reed, that doesn't  go very deep, but he played for about an hour on the spot, or on the spot, and wife came  on, walked off stage, people started clapping for, obviously, take a walk to the wild side,  did not come out, would not play the talk. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Doesn't play his fucking hits?  The one song people would want to hear.  Right, right.  The one song that allowed him to buy some fucking, you know, penthouse somewhere.  Yeah.  You gotta play the song.  I hate when these guys do that.  It's annoying.  It's annoying.  Unless you have so many hits, then you're like, wow, I can't play Walk on the Wild Side,  because I got so many other ones I gotta do tonight.  Sweet jazz.  But they purposely do that shit, Radiohead, with Creep, they refuse to play that. 
[00:45:30]  Why would they?  There's a million examples of this.  That's bullshit, because most of the people are, you know, want to hear the goddamn song.  Radiohead's another band I tried.  I tried.  I wanted to like them, because I know they're very respected.  They've had a couple of songs that crossed over into, like, hit territory, and the rest  is this fucking experimental sounding chords crap.  I think it's awful.  Terrible.  I wish I didn't think that.  I tried.  Yeah.  Oh.  Fuck, it just doesn't reach me. 
[00:46:00]  Sometimes music doesn't know.  What about fake plastic trees?  I don't know that one.  God.  What about Blackstar?  I don't know it.  Maybe I've heard it and didn't know it.  I like, to be fair, I like Radiohead's The Benz, thanks to Stephen Lynch.  He turned me on to that album years ago.  And then I like a, just I'll handpick a few other songs.  That's it for me.  But The Benz, I love the fucking album from beginning to end.  Yeah.  From beginning to end, I love that album.  I wish I did, because they're like a really, I guess different than anything I listen to. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  God, I tried to.  But then because of The Benz, I try to, like, listen to other albums, and I just, not the  same for me, man.  Yeah.  This is Radiohead right here.  Not on the horizon, not across the neon light.  Wow.  Very good. 
[00:47:00]  Are the vocals recorded low?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  This is all right.  He's off The Benz.  Obviously.  I'm a crab.  Do you know, I was going through those old tapes of ours, fast forwarding, finding certain  things, and Mustard was one of the guys, and it just was making me laugh. 
[00:47:30]  That's how annoying Anthony gets.  I'm a snob.  You don't like the way he sings, though?  Um, eh, you know.  Well, the, uh.  It's his own style.  Okay.  Mustard wrote me the other day.  Did he?  Yeah, we keep in touch.  Oh, yeah?  He told me.  Uh-huh.  I don't know if I'm the.  Ah, fuck it.  He's going to be on The Voice.  Really?  Huh?  He said, what? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, Mustard's going to be on The Voice.  He wrote me the other day.  In January.  So, I don't know.  Yeah?  I don't know, you know, if it's just the auditions.  I don't know if he's getting picked.  They asked him to do it?  Oh, yeah.  So, maybe he's just.  He's probably doing a TV audition, then.  They set it up.  Yeah.  You don't have to wait on this stupid.  Out in front of a.  Yeah, so.  Arena line.  Our old pal, Homeless Mustard, is going to be on The Voice.  I just saw a video of E-Rock sniffing his toes.  Ugh.  And of, uh, him kissing Bobo on the nose. 
[00:48:30]  Isn't that great?  Oh, God.  I think I got that video somewhere.  I'll look for it.  I have it.  I just watched it.  I think I already have it up on my channel.  Stupid Bobo DMs me.  Could you take the naked picture of me?  I was like, I didn't put up a naked picture of you, you dumbass.  Who put up a naked picture of Bobo?  I have no idea.  It was like, fucking him in the tub.  He goes, the one in the tub is okay, but the naked what?  I'm like, that's the only one I put up.  There's no nudity in the picture I put up.  Anything that's up with him is blurred out.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  He's an idiot.  Vinny wants in so badly right now.  Vinny at Staten Island.  Go ahead, Vinny.  Fuck Lou Reed.  Fuck Radiohead.  Fuck Emerson, Lake, and Palmer and their fucking 45-minute bullshit interlude.  I understand the first two, but we weren't even talking about Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  Yeah, but just that whole fucking...  Another pretentious fucking horse shit band.  Fuck you, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  Stick it up your ass.  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer is another one of those bands. 
[00:49:30]  You hear a song or two on the radio, and you go, well, I want to see what these guys are about.  And then you're very disappointed.  Oh, you're just wrapped up in a keyboard whirlwind as you're trying to fucking relax.  What other bands disappoint you after you hear their one song on the radio?  Yeah, and you hear their hit.  And you think they're going to be the greatest thing ever.  And they just suck.  The Pogues disappointed me.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I like a couple of their songs, but I just can't go too deep with them.  That's off-kilter, too, those guys. 
[00:50:00]  They're wacky.  Like, I really liked Shane McGowan.  And then the more I've heard of him, the more I started liking the other Irish guys better.  Yeah, he was okay.  I don't know much about the Pogues, either.  I know you brought a few songs to the show.  Just from Anthony's brother Joe, actually.  I heard him playing in the Ant's house one time.  It was Dirty Old Town.  I'm like, I like that.  What is that?  That's a great song.  It's not even their song.  It's like an old, old.  But I couldn't get into a lot of their other...  I would rather hear like Ronnie Drew or somebody else.  That guy needs a dentist. 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  I think he has teeth now, I heard.  Does he?  Yeah.  It's endearing.  Is it?  He knows he doesn't need teeth anymore.  It's endearing.  That's hilarious.  It's endearing.  But he can't sing the old Pogues.  More bullshit words that people use.  Yeah.  Get your teeth fixed.  Hey, can you go to Black Earl's Twitter?  Because he had a lot to say about Lou Reed.  Oh, he sure did.  He liked them?  Earl likes to think he's like part of the New York fabric.  Black Earl is like the Grim Reaper's henchman.  He fucking makes the announcements.  He's his spokesperson.  Yeah.  He's the fucking... 
[00:51:00]  He's the Grim Reaper's fucking Jay Carney.  Black Earl used to be part of our show, I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah, back in the NAW days.  He worked at NAW when we did, is what it comes down to.  And we put him on the air from time to time.  And he's all about the music, man.  Oh, yeah.  Iraq, comment.  Before the Lou Reed stuff, a few weeks ago, Earl was going to different juice bars around  Manhattan and explaining why the juice was so pure compared to what you buy in the stores.  That was...  Who was he doing that for?  Earl's doing.  Himself.  An investigative report. 
[00:51:30]  He was just going to juice bars.  Yeah, well, that's...  That would be pretty obvious.  Earl Douglas for no one cares.  Right.  You got fresh vegetables and they're making juice out of it.  Yeah.  What do you think it's going to taste like?  I think it's going to taste pretty fresh and pure.  He's busting those controversies wide open.  Compared to something that they bottled, I don't know, a week ago, two weeks ago.  Yeah, yeah.  And shipped to you.  Yeah, I think it might be fresher, Earl.  I'm a big juice fan.  People need to know. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  Love a good juice.  I have a juice every day.  Mark Spitz.  Eight fucking dollars for a juice, though, man.  Juice.  But that's the one you pull out?  Mark Spitz?  I was going to...  Well, he was great in his day.  It's the only Jewish sports figure that's been in history for the past fucking hundred years.  No, there was that other guy.  Rod Carew?  Oh.  Well, the bit was to not name anyone there, Eric, but thank you.  Eric did pull back to you.  For actually coming up with Rod Carew.  Eric, he's been a fan of business this morning. 
[00:52:30]  He's just ratting everyone out and trampling over everyone's shit.  The bin bit here.  Literal joke guy.  Wasn't it obvious the bit was to never name another one, but try?  Who cares if Rod Carew was kind of dewy?  Rod Carew!  Erick comes up with his knowledge.  He's just sad, too, because I guess some Simpson voice died over the weekend.  Oh, yeah, from the Newhart Show.  We know her from the Bob Newhart Show, of course.  The secretary.  Marsha something. 
[00:53:00]  Marsha Wallace.  Wallace, right.  Who was she in The Simpsons?  Edna Krabappel.  Oh, right.  The teacher.  Krabappel.  Edna Krabappel.  Was that the only character she did?  That was the only one.  Oh, God.  She sucks.  Simpsons have been on the air for, what, 50 years, and she couldn't come up with another  voice for them?  Everybody on that show does, like, half the show.  A million.  Yeah.  Why did she only have one?  She sucked.  That's all they had her do.  Not like Homer dropped dead.  Jesus.  Don't worry about it.  You're going to be just fine. 
[00:53:30]  Don't sweat it.  What's Earl's tweet?  You've got to do the first one where he's going to have...  All right, yeah.  You know which one?  Yeah, it's just so pretentious, because he is really acting like he's the Twitter account  for New Yorkers to follow.  Yeah, here it is.  R.I.P.  Lou Reed.  We'll have more later.  Lost for words right now.  Lost for words.  He's always lost for words.  And by the way, he's not lost for words.  That's another one of those dumb things.  Right.  You have nothing to say.  Lost for words.  That's poignant. 
[00:54:00]  You're so grief-stricken.  You're lost for words.  You can't even speak.  You didn't know the guy personally.  How would you be lost for words?  And we'll have more later, as if you're the news source.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I better check in with Earl.  How many hours did he need for the next tweet about Lou Reed?  He really thought it over.  How long were his words fucking gone for?  Well, the first one was 16 hours ago.  Okay.  Then he followed that up 16 hours ago.  Wait, I thought he was a little lost for words.  He found them real quick.  He found some words.  So, within the same hour, he found words? 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank God.  And what was that?  One of the best songs ever, written ever.  Ever.  About New York.  Love you, Lou.  You've earned your rest.  No one wants to earn their rest.  You want to earn your rest if you're able to wake up at some point.  Yeah, of course.  Fuck.  Love you, Lou.  Love you, Lou.  You've earned your rest.  Earned your rest?  You think Lou's fucking reading Twitter? 
[00:55:00]  Reading Earl's Twitter?  Oh, good.  That's what he's saying is Jim Norton-ing.  Stop romanticizing death.  Yeah.  Earn your rest.  Oh, you just tuckered out?  All right.  From not singing?  Yes, he's reading Twitter and then saying, oh, good.  Earl Douglas loved me.  Earl says I could fucking relax now.  Sweet Jane.  What song did he mean was one of the best songs written ever about New York?  NYC Man.  Oh, God.  I never heard that.  Do you have that?  Sure. 
[00:55:30]  Let's hear it.  Oh, this was another song about New York?  What Earl says is a, how long is this piece of shit?  What year is this?  It's from his 1996 album.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Maybe it's different.  It's a newer song.  So I'd walk the streets of New York again.  Yeah.  To see things we can't possibly have seen ourselves.  You're ready to be enlightened about New York.  All right.  This is some jazz shit right here.  You like jazz?  I love it.  It's my favorite type of music. 
[00:56:00]  It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart.  I accidentally crush it on the nights of March.  I prefer you was straightforward.  You don't have to go through all of that.  I'm a New York City man, baby.  Say go and that is that. 
[00:56:30]  New York City man.  You just say go and that is that.  I'm a New York City man.  You just say go and that is that.  You just say go and that is that.  Earl's an idiot.  It's complicated to make up a lie that you'd have to remember and really why. 
[00:57:00]  I wouldn't want to be around you if you didn't want to have me around.  I'm an M-A-N-N man.  You blink your eyes and I'll be gone.  M-A-N-N man.  You blink your eyes, honey, and I'll be gone.  How does Earl say this is the best song about New York that was ever, ever written, ever?  It's not.  Yeah, yeah.  New York State of Mind.  Billy Joel. 
[00:57:30]  New York, New York.  New York.  Come on.  There's plenty of New York songs that...  This isn't even the top million.  You know it's in a mood if he's preferring a Jay-Z song.  It's not Jay-Z's version I like.  Oh.  This is not the best song about New York ever.  Alicia Keys is singing.  This isn't even close.  Oh, look.  He's all over the TV.  I know what the best New York song ever is. 
[00:58:00]  What?  Iraq, do you have it?  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Yes.  We're back.  This is great.  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the O.B.N. Anthony Show.  Oh.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  The O.B.N. Anthony Show.  Ten years and more.  Serious, Serious, X-Hands.  The O.B.N. Anthony Show.  Oh, yes. 
[00:59:00]  What does it say? 
[00:59:30]  I don't know if I've heard this either.  We got Black Earl on the line, our old pal.  What's up, Earl?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Well, we're all mourning the passing of Lou Reed. 
[01:00:00]  The untimely passing.  The untimely passing of Lou Reed.  And I know you were a big Lou Reed fan.  Could tell by the Twitter.  Yep.  Yeah.  Loved, yeah.  Loved, loved.  What did you like about him?  Um, just really, he was the street.  He was the street to the core, man.  Yeah, man.  True that.  How is he street?  I don't know what that means.  He was like part of the New York City fabric, right, Earl? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  He was New York.  Uh-huh.  When you think New York, you think Lou Reed.  Well, he's also, you know, he brought a real sense of realism to the music.  Absolutely.  Explain that further.  The music was real.  I mean, I mean, think about it.  Before Lou Reed, you didn't have really, like, really deep songs about drugs, about... 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, Rolling Stones weren't into that at all.  Yeah, Dad neither.  But you liked his, uh, you liked lyrically what he did.  He really, he really delved into that drug culture like no, like no one else.  Yeah.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Earl?  Hello, guys.  No, you were breaking up for a second.  See, that's one of the things he does.  I have a million phone calls where Earl goes, you're breaking up. 
[01:01:30]  Nothing changes.  Earl.  It's been years.  He really, he really tackled the drug culture in his songs.  I said, explain that further, please.  Thanks.  Yeah, I mean, think about a song like Heroin.  Think about a song like Waiting for the Man.  Thinking about, uh, uh, just trying to think of something else, uh, off the top of my head.  Well, we're thinking about it.  Well, even, you know, Walk on the Wild Side, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  I never heard that.  There was some drug action in that song as well.  And what about New York, uh, New York Man?  Oh, New York City Man, I think it's...  New York City Man?  Written about New York.  Why is it the best song written about New York, in your words?  A lot of New York songs out there.  Yep.  Well, just, you know, first of all, it's a fantastic song.  What makes it a fantastic song? 
[01:02:30]  Earl, what makes it a fantastic song?  You can't just say it's a fantastic song.  What makes it a fantastic song?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Comment.  Earl.  Earl.  Hello.  Earl, what are you doing?  Earl. 
[01:03:00]  Earl.  Earl, we know you're still there.  What's going on?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, hello.  I don't know.  Earl.  He didn't hang up.  Maybe someone sprayed some Febreze, and he passed out.  Like those sheep.  Earl.  The sleeping sheep.  Can we call Earl?  Remember, he used to just pass out.  Yes. 
[01:03:30]  Earl.  Earl.  Can we call Earl back?  And now he hangs up.  He's at a loss for words.  He is at a loss for words.  It's always the second question that always has gotten him.  Throws him.  That's why I was laughing so much, because you go, okay, you like Lou Reed.  Yes.  Well, what song?  Well, I mean, you know, even take a walk on the wild side.  Well, why?  You're breaking up.  He reiterates the same thing he said in his Twitter. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, it's the best song.  Here comes Earl.  All right.  Make him believe that he couldn't hear us.  Earl.  Early.  Yo.  Why is that a great song about New York?  Great song about New York?  It's very literate.  It has, you know, historical references, both in literature.  What historical references?  Quotes of Shakespeare.  Quotes of... 
[01:04:30]  Shakespeare is, of course, a grand New Yorker.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be a great Shakespeare song, then?  What makes it such a great New York song?  Because there's a lot of songs that have been written about New York over the years.  Well, I understand that, but I don't know.  I like the feel of it.  I like the energy of it.  It's kind of different for Lou, because it was kind of a laid-back song.  Almost sentimental, because he was hardly sentimental.  Really?  What do you mean about sentimental? 
[01:05:00]  The fact that he was born in Brooklyn, and he's singing about New York City?  Well, no, that's sentimental in the sense that, let's say, like...  Earl, your Twitter said you're a huge Lou Reed fan.  Yes, I'm a huge Lou Reed fan.  I went to it two and a half hours ago, so I'm not the sharpest that I am right now.  Up, just reflecting.  Still a little self-reflection. 
[01:05:30]  Still a little too emotional right now.  Lost for words.  Lost for words.  The old loss for words.  Yeah, well, you know, it must be great to live your life with that moniker.  I'm not a loss for words.  Lost for words.  What, uh, you're going to be on, uh, with Ronnie today?  Talk a little about Lou?  Yeah, I hope so.  I'd like to hear that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, uh, I know he's, you know, I know he's very upset about it.  Oh, have you spoken to him? 
[01:06:00]  Uh, not yet, no.  So how do you know he's very upset about it?  Um, he's a big, as big a fan as I was.  Well, and you're a huge...  I find that hard to believe.  And you're a huge fan.  He doesn't know at all.  Hmm.  Big, uh, Lou Reed fan.  On the phone, Earl Douglas.  Oh, I got one, um, because this is one thing we discussed earlier we don't understand.  Like, a lot of people say that Lou Reed was very influential in their careers. 
[01:06:30]  Mm-hmm.  Why is that?  Go.  Well, influential in the sense that, you know, he brought an avant-garde sense to the music  he brought.  I think it brought realism to lyrics.  Um, on top of everything else, fantastic guitar player, too.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  How about the singing?  Singing, um, well, you didn't, you know, like Dylan, you didn't necessarily have to be 
[01:07:00]  a virtuoso to be a fantastic singer.  That's true.  Dylan, though, I at least sang.  Dylan did do a lot of singing.  Lou Reed kind of talks things.  Hmm.  Yeah, he kind of...  More talks.  Yeah, it was like more talking, but it was also...  Like, what we're doing right now could be a Lou Reed song.  Right.  Wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  You know, he just brought this kind of...  It was almost... 
[01:07:30]  It wasn't quite spoken word, but it was also very rock and roll, in the sense.  You know, it kept it simple.  It was always...  Two guitars, bass, drums.  Not a lot of chord changes.  Uh-huh.  But the thing is, now, Earl, I've heard Lou Reed...  Everyone's talking about him today.  God bless.  But I've heard Lou Reed described as, like, the godfather of punk.  Right.  Of punk.  I don't really...  If I listen to any of his songs, even the live versions, I'm not hearing much punk-sounding 
[01:08:00]  music there.  How is that title given to him?  Well, he sang about trannies, so that's kind of punk-ish.  Well...  No one else was singing about trannies, right?  I'm not feeling like, you know, when you listen to something like the Dead Kennedys, things  like that, even the Clash, you know?  Maybe it wasn't the punk sound.  Maybe it was the...  Well, Earl, why don't you explain?  Well, we can do it now like rock and roll animals.  Sure.  Sex Pistols.  Except all of the Velvet Underground classics.  But we were listening to some of that. 
[01:08:30]  We were actually listening to Sweet Jane off of that album.  And though I found the music very interesting and very good and melodic, again, not much  punk sound there.  Well, I don't know if it was punk in sound as much as punk in attitude, volume.  And it is.  Keeping it simple, loud.  But punk wasn't known to keep it really simple.  No, I kind of like, you know, when you're getting a brick punk, you know, right, thrown  at you.  I don't know if that's simple. 
[01:09:00]  Fucking safety pins through the cheeks.  I don't know if that's keeping it simple.  You know, fucking sex pistols.  You're talking attitude.  I mean, as far as musical approach.  Right.  Both punk bands, probably some of the first songs they learned were Velvet Underground songs,  so they're very basic to learn.  They would go, you know, one or two chords.  What's a big Velvet Underground song, Earl?  Obviously Sweet Jane, White Light, White Heat, Waiting for the Man, Sen Fatale, Venus and 
[01:09:30]  Furs, Pale Blue Eyes.  Earl, you're doing Lou Reed proud today.  There's one other thing.  People are talking today about how he, you know, didn't give a crap about commercial success.  You want to discuss that a little bit with comment, Earl?  A little bit today?  Well, he didn't necessarily adhere to trends.  He didn't have to, you know, there wasn't no dance remixes.  There weren't any Lou Reed disco songs.  There weren't any Lou Reed, you know, bubblegum pop. 
[01:10:00]  He kind of followed his own path.  That sort of trailblazer does play his own path.  Unless he's selling Honda scooters.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  At the time, even that was kind of, it was Lou Reed.  Because Lou Reed isn't necessarily.  Uh-oh.  There he is.  Lending his, uh...  This is the epitome of selling out, by the way.  This is punk right here. 
[01:10:30]  Using your...  It's like a dance remix a little bit.  Using your hit song...  To sell some corporate project.  Man.  We'll fight.  Hey.  Don't settle for walking.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, he's sitting on a scooter.  Hey, don't settle for walking.  There's a guy that didn't want commercials, or didn't care about commercial success.  Oh.  But used my hit song to sell Honda scooters.  A couple of bucks. 
[01:11:00]  They probably offered him a lot of money right there.  Right.  You know?  But, hey.  Since he saw how much he was going to make, oh, he gave a shit.  Exactly.  All those fucking punk principles go out the fucking window.  Blaze that trail on a Honda scooter.  Right.  Why did he tell the man to go fuck himself, Earl?  Hey, but look at it this way.  Johnny Rotten sold butter.  You know?  How many commercials are the class songs in?  I don't particularly mind when music is used in a commercial.  Oh, I don't mind either.  I think it's a silly thing that people put on artists to use your music for commercial. 
[01:11:30]  There was a time it was very taboo.  Yeah, they didn't do it.  Yeah, not so much anymore.  That's true.  Especially since music's being stolen now so much online and all that shit.  It's like, hey, man.  These guys are going to make fucking a couple million.  Let them make it.  You get a nice payday.  Well, Earl, your reflections on Lou Reed have been terrific today.  I'm hearing from people here.  Let's see.  Can Earl and Sal get a show together?  Just call it hipster bullshit.  Hmm.  What the hell's that about?  It's not my opinion, Earl. 
[01:12:00]  Not mine either.  It's obviously a horrible person.  I love Earl.  I think you filled in the blanks perfectly today because we're not getting Lou Reed fans here.  No, we need an education.  Now we have a little more knowledge on the whole thing.  A little education.  Are you going to Barney's today, Earl?  No.  No, huh?  How about the Jay-Z?  How about the Jay-Z?  Jay-Z is like...  How about the Jay-Z defending his deal with Barney's?  Because there's way too much fucking money involved. 
[01:12:30]  Like, Barney's racist.  It's shop and frisk now.  And Jay-Z's like, slow down.  Hold on a minute.  Let's all slow down.  Hold on a minute.  Everyone's bullshit comes out eventually.  Jay-Z is a big bullshit artist.  If he believes there's some racism going down at Barney's, and he does behind closed doors,  then he probably should take that deal and tell Barney's to go fuck themselves.  But there's way too much money involved for the Jay-Z. 
[01:13:00]  I like that Reverend Al is calling for a boycott of Barney's if they don't have a full investigation,  which entails, I guess, everyone at the organization being fired.  And he has a rhyme.  We went from stop and frisk to shop and frisk.  You know what?  Stop and frisk I agree with.  But there's a legit point.  So these were both paying customers.  And look, if Barney's came out and said, look, yeah, we do racially profile at times and they bite us in the ass. 
[01:13:30]  I'd respect Barney's.  Yeah.  But they won't say that?  Of course they won't.  But these were two people just making legit purchases and the fucking cops are stopping them.  It's like, this guy, you can't have that shit.  Well, someone called the cops.  No, no, Barney's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you can't, like, fault the cops on that one.  They're just following through.  Right.  But Barney's, I gather their loss prevention policy entails looking for black people that are spending a lot of money  and questioning whether it's a legit purchase. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And you can't do that in 2013 and not expect to hear shit from it.  Like, if you're going to do that, at least take the repercussions and say that you do it.  Do you know what I mean?  If it's really saved you a lot of problems, fine, but don't expect black people don't want to shop there.  But don't look for Jay-Z to do anything drastic.  Oh, Hannah.  Hannah.  Hannah.  Oh, Hannah.  Hannah.  Isn't Macy's in trouble, too?  Yeah, Macy's did the same thing. 
[01:14:30]  But I'll tell you, Barney's is getting more flack for some reason.  I told these guys before the show, I go to Barney's once a year, there's never anyone in there  because this stuff is so ridiculously expensive.  It's very expensive.  As a matter of fact, that kid was buying a fucking $300 belt.  Right.  And the girl bought like a $2,000 purse.  Yeah.  I got to be honest, I love Barney's.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, I love a good fucking up and down.  I don't like the price tag.  No, I hate it, but I still love walking around Barney's.  Jim goes in there in complete blackface.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  And I take things. 
[01:15:00]  Just to make their lives harder.  I love a good one.  But let's talk about the Jay-Z.  Jay-Z.  Jay-Z, are you going to cancel your deal with Barney's?  Ah!  Hannah!  Hannah!  I think that was his exact statement.  Oh, yeah.  As Reverend Al is going to boycott and he's getting his troops together, Jay-Z's like, slow down.  Yeah.  Slow down.  Because he obviously is going to make millions off the Barney's deal. 
[01:15:30]  Yep.  Al Sharpton threatens boycott of Barney's over racial profiling.  Oh, boy.  I want to see the Jay-Z, though.  Reverend Al is something right in.  What is the Jay-Z saying?  He's saying like, look, can't we all just get along?  I guess when they look at, you know, their loss prevention and the videotapes of people  that have been shoplifting, perhaps they're profiling.  Yeah.  Perhaps. 
[01:16:00]  Just say that you're doing that, then.  Right.  Again, what annoys me is the lack of honesty.  Oh, yeah.  Say you're doing it and say, look, we're apologizing and maybe we shouldn't have, but we were racially  profiling.  Yeah.  Well, the problem is then the people that should go, oh, okay, at least you're being  honest, go, well, there you go.  Now we got to fire everyone.  Well, exactly.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's why that shit doesn't work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  You know, it used to be, well, we've done this break a million times, but it used to  be you get in trouble, you throw a little apology out there and like, oh, okay, apologize.  He understands.  Okay.  Let him continue his job. 
[01:16:30]  No.  They expect the apology before they get you fired.  Yeah.  Model doodle.  Well, they had the kid had the ID.  I think he had the proper ID and stuff for the card.  It sounds like Barney's fucked up.  They fucked up badly.  Yeah.  So with that, Jay-Z should go, well, Barney, sorry, but I'm going to have to pull all my  stuff out of your store.  I mean, when I...  Because I got to stand behind my people.  I remember when I got, the IRS got on me for two, two thousand, two $2,000 winning lottery  tickets that I cashed in in Philadelphia. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  I never did that.  But I went on my fucking tax bill, and then they pulled the tape, and there's some fucking  black guy cashing tickets using my fucking name, address, and a social security number  that wasn't mine, thank God.  Did that back walk the IRS?  No.  It took forever to try to convince them I didn't win this fucking thing.  Some fucking savage was cashing in my goddamn ticket. 
[01:17:30]  And it probably cost her more than the two Gs, right?  Oh, yeah.  I had a, you know, fucking Harvey sending checks to take care of the problem.  So Harvey got it.  He had to get paid.  Yeah.  Earl, you added a lot to the Jay-Z situation, too.  Thank you, sir.  So you do have to look at the percentages of people that are pulling shenanigans in stores  and wherever, and kind of wonder if that's why people are profiling. 
[01:18:00]  I mean, I don't think it's on Jay-Z.  You know what?  If you're really upset about it, why not just boycott Barney and the Jay-Z product?  Hey, no!  Slow down.  Slow down, boycott Jay-Z.  I'll hear you.  What the hell was that?  That's how Jay-Z sounds, man.  To the white man.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you think Barneys will do, Earl?  I'm curious as to what a black gentleman thinks Barneys will do.  How do they handle this?  They're going to sacrifice somebody. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah, of course.  But if Jay-Z's standing behind Barneys, then Barneys is totally safe.  Stupid Reverend Al Sharpton needs Jay-Z to, you know, to step on his side.  No, I think what, you know, in the end, Reverend Al represents Reverend Al.  That's true.  They're going to cut a deal somewhere.  Somewhere, you know, money's going to be exchanged somewhere.  Just to have that used to be fat fuck go away.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  It's always about fucking him getting something.  That old shoe.  That'll be a donation to the National Action Network.  National Action Network!  Reverend Al looks like an old shoe.  He does.  An old brown shoe.  All right, Earl, I miss these days of just riffing you.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking great shit.  Earl Douglas.  Earl, Earl, fucking, please, wait a minute.  Dave Herman, comment.  All right.  You were a big Dave Herman fan. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And his radio stuff.  You loved the Dave Herman.  We were absolutely, positively stunned.  I can't even put into words.  Lost for words.  Again, I think you're the only thing, Earl.  You're stunned, are you?  Yeah.  You know, I've known Dave off and on.  Really?  Going out on a limb?  Yeah.  I hope you're stunned.  Yeah.  How long have you known Dave?  Did you know Dave?  I've known for almost 25 years.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  How many times?  Okay, guys. 
[01:20:00]  And the idea of it is like, it is so shocking.  And so...  You didn't really have that much in common with him?  No.  You ever share any young ladies with him down there in St. Croix?  No.  No?  Absolutely no.  You never had an indication that this guy had anything going on?  Zero.  Wow.  Absolutely zero indication.  I mean, could you make something up like this?  Sure.  I have.  The New York Radio Message Board, I'm seeing a fuckload of people making excuses for him, 
[01:20:30]  doubting that it's him.  They really are coming to his aid and not believing this.  Delusional.  Those fuckwads.  Dave Herman, of course, is the guy that wanted to have sex with a six-year-old.  A six-year-old.  She was seven.  Well, not, she's officially seven.  She went from six to seven.  She was made up person, by the way, because it was a sting.  It started when she was six.  Right.  His fucking, him trying to get a, he was courting her at six. 
[01:21:00]  So what do they say on the message board?  It's unbelievable.  They're saying it could be a setup, and, you know, I doubt.  But Dave Herman, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a whole bunch of horse shit.  You know, they didn't really know Dave Herman because they just listened to his radio show.  All these assholes are still trolling that fucking board.  I mean, from what I read, they got emails, they got phone calls.  Yeah.  It looks bad.  Is it true?  I heard Scott Muni likes fucking small animals. 
[01:21:30]  Comment, Earl.  No?  Yeah?  You sure?  Really?  Don't be a little of the dead.  Stop.  Damn.  Did Carol Miller, did Carol Miller have five Yorkshire Terriers and a jar of peanut butter?  That's what I'm hearing.  No?  Dave.  Stop.  Yeah?  Did Vin Skelson used to put vegetation up his ass?  That's what I'm hearing.  Dave.  Yeah?  Did Pete Fornatel used to jack off in the largest rock and roll library? 
[01:22:00]  God, no.  All right.  Just going through all the rumors I'm hearing.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  The Dave thing is, it's disturbing and in the end, very, very sad.  It really is.  Who's it sad for?  Sad for the possible children that he may have had sex with?  Right.  You know, hey, imagine being, you know, imagine being as kids. 
[01:22:30]  Who's it sad for?  Maybe his family, I guess.  Sure.  Not just the...  I'm just happy they got another fucking creep.  Right.  And if it's true, they should shoot him in the back of the head.  What do you think of that, Earl?  They got a creep!  What do you think of that shit, Earl?  Yeah.  I mean...  I know it's not a death penalty case, but I truly believe they should fucking take him  out back if it's true and shoot him in the back of the head.  Yeah.  What do you think of those apples?  Wow.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  You're entitled to feel that way?  I mean, I don't think...  Again...  It didn't hurt that the motherfucker sued me and Ann for $10 million.  That's true.  And had one of his pals secretly taping us.  That's true.  Wiretapping us.  That's true.  How do you feel, Earl, about a guy who was trying to have a seven-year-old flown to another  country so he could give her alcohol and stick his cock in her, possibly by force?  Wow.  When I heard the story, it made me sick to my stomach.  No, no.  Let's say for the sake of argument, it's true.  Let's speculate and say that it is true. 
[01:23:30]  Mm-hmm.  If it's true, how does it change the way you feel about Dave Herman?  Well, you know...  Hey, you lose respect for anybody who wants to even think that much or try that.  Losing Earl's respect?  Well, that's punishment enough.  It was...  Oh, Earl.  I love Earl.  Earl rules.  I like throwing the ball around with Earl.  Just tossing it around with Earl.  Just tossing it around. 
[01:24:00]  All right, Earl.  Good stuff today, buddy.  Love you.  Miss you.  Take care, Earl.  Call up Ronnie later.  I want to hear that exchange.  Yes.  All right?  Ronnie will be all about Lou Reed today.  Yeah.  In a very brilliant way, I'm sure.  In a serious way.  Yes.  Fucking...  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Ron's a bandwagon Lou Reed fan.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  He never listened to the songs.  The colored girl song I like.  The colored girl song.  Sam, you want to break down the black girl phone call?  He must do so terribly on job interviews. 
[01:24:30]  You think he's really bad?  He has a lot of tells.  He knows he can use the phone as an excuse one time.  He also knows if he repeats the question being asked, that it buys him more time.  Buys him that much more time.  Where he hopes something pops in his brain.  Right.  Because you go, what makes you...  Do you think you'd be a good candidate for this job?  Yes, I do.  Why do you think that?  Why do I think that?  He gets tripped up by the second question.  Why do I think I'd be a good candidate for the job?  Well, just generally, you know... 
[01:25:00]  I have an appreciation for the business at hand.  Right.  It's all...  What?  It's just vague.  This vagary, this fucking...  And then he uses, I'm at a loss for words.  Yes.  See, people will accept that one time if you say it.  Yeah.  You can't say it every time a question is asked.  What comes out of Earl's mouth is like Hamburger Helper.  It just stretches and bulks up.  Right.  He just...  He just...  He feigns death.  Yes.  So, like, he thinks that if he makes a short statement, he can trick people into thinking 
[01:25:30]  it's poignant.  So, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, what are your qualifications for this job?  What are my qualifications for this job?  Well, I've, uh...  You know, I have a lot of heart.  Like, what does that mean?  Mm-hmm.  I have a lot of, uh, passion.  Passion for the business.  So, with that, you're, uh, you're breaking up.  Earl, I'm sitting right in front of you.  I'm sitting right in front of you.  I'm not on a phone.  And then he completely panicked.  See, unfortunately, you guys at home didn't see this, but when he was silent for, it looked, 
[01:26:00]  it seemed like about a minute.  I heard him.  He was in the background.  Yeah.  The phone didn't hang up yet.  No.  And then he doesn't even acknowledge when we call him back that he had a problem with the  phone.  No.  Because he panicked and didn't know what to do.  And then finally hung up on himself.  Not only does he not acknowledge it, but then you call him back and you go, Earl, and  he goes, what's up, guys?  It's like, hey, I'm back.  But nothing ever happened.  Hopefully you don't remember that I was just talking to you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  First time this morning, huh?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  How you doing?  So, all right.  That's good.  Good stuff.  That's good stuff.  What?  What?  Earl.  Oh, I love Earl.  He just tickles me.  Love him to death.  Yeah, he does.  So there's Dave Herman apologists on the New York Radio message board.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  The thread's gotten very big.  It's the biggest thread in fucking years.  In a long time for those guys.  Oh, my God.  But a lot of people yelling back and forth.  I got tired.  I just finally just stopped reading their shit.  That's the biggest fucking thread since transmitter DL640 went down during Sandy. 
[01:27:00]  But then you got a bunch of fucking grubes.  And I just read one by Alan Stiffen, who is just an absolute dullard.  But there was something.  I guess people were going off.  And he just types, enough.  This is a radio board.  Well, what do you think?  Hey, dummy.  People are talking about a radio guy.  Yeah, you're finally getting some action on your message board.  Let it go.  Stinks. 
[01:27:30]  He writes that again.  Somebody writes about, like, well, what about the children?  And blah, blah, blah.  And he goes, okay, enough.  Let's stick to the radio side of this.  What's the radio side of this?  He's been out of radio for years.  Let's try to figure out what songs the seven-year-old, like, listening to.  Do you think he'd get a gig on Radio Disney?  Right.  What's the radio side of this?  The radio.  He's being accused of being a kid fucker.  Yeah, somebody who was big in New York radio was accused of being a kid fucker.  That's a huge story.  And people are talking about it like you're a dumb board.  Yeah.  And you want to fucking go in there and just go, 
[01:28:00]  You're crazy, guys.  Alan Sniffen.  Enough.  He's terrible.  Keep it to the radio side, guys.  Yeah.  Does he have board reflections on this?  Board reflections.  We haven't done board reflections in a while, but as soon as he has one, we have to play it on the show.  Oh, my God.  Let's go talk about the apparent.  And it'll be like, why can't we keep it on the radio side?  As a radio host, he was wondering.  Board...  Yeah, yeah.  It's just awful.  Board reflections. 
[01:28:30]  Does anybody...  This whole message board is designed for him to pretend that he has the gift of radio.  Yes, yes.  Meanwhile, you know, he's a dentist.  Ugh.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  Message boards in general are shit.  They always start with good intentions and then...  Oh, they just turn to...  Just shit.  Garbage.  Garbage-io.  They're not very...  I don't think they're very used as much, at least, anymore, because of the instant...  When you have your Twitters and whatnot. 
[01:29:00]  And everything's on...  And Facebook's...  Everything's on Reddit anyway.  Yeah.  I never go on Reddit, but...  Reddit, Reddit.  I find it hard to navigate for some reason, like an idiot I am.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, it definitely takes you...  Yeah, it's not user-friendly.  But once you start using it, it's like...  Ah, yeah.  Easy.  Yeah.  Pretty.  Board reflections.  You know what they've been doing a lot lately?  What, sweetie?  You go.  On that board is...  They do this thing called Radio Rewind or Rewound, something like that.  Oh, yeah.  Where they take old air checks and they put the music back into the air checks, so it 
[01:29:30]  sounds like you're listening to the broadcast as it happened back in the day.  Denny must love this.  I think Denny has some involvement with some of this.  Man, who's doing this?  Do we have an example?  I know what you mean, my sweet.  Every now and then, they post something that's called Radio Rewind.  Or something like that, where they're taking old air checks that they find and recreating  it.  Like, taking the air checks, putting it back with the music, cleaning it up.  Yeah, the air checks.  There's never...  They never put the songs in the air checks. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Like, when you turn your mic on, that's when the air check would start.  And then you turn your mic off during the song, and it wouldn't record the song.  So they're taking those and editing back in the music, and then put it on so it's like  you were there.  It's a little time machine, isn't it?  Great.  I don't mind that as much.  Yeah, it makes sense.  I agree why you do that.  When they're not posting photos to their trips to transmitter sites.  They don't go to transmitter sites.  Oh, yeah, they do.  Why?  What do you do there?  A field trip to the transmitter? 
[01:30:30]  Besides fry your balls off.  Why do they call it the stick?  Ugh.  Why would they visit that?  Radio people have terrible weekends.  They really don't have anything going on.  Let's go to the transmitter.  All right, then you go...  All right, let's play it out.  Then you're there.  Then what happens?  Some pictures, little fucking Instagram.  There's me and some transmitter in Irvington, New Jersey, and it's just like one little shed  with a fence around it.  It's always that dumb shed, the fence around it, and the giant fucking tower.  That's it.  All right.  Big whoop-dee-doo.  Now what? 
[01:31:00]  But they take multiple photos, and then you've got to post them, and then it's like,  wow, really exciting picture of you at the fucking transmitter.  Thanks for sharing.  Yeah, thanks for sharing.  By the way, here's a Thursday throwback of me at the transmitter of WOR back...  Ugh.  Thanks for sharing.  Jesus.  Those guys make it really difficult to love and defend radio.  Oh, and E-Rock, you're one of these radio purists.  Yep.  Not to that level.  No way.  Are you a student of? 
[01:31:30]  Yep.  Are you a student of?  Student of, yes.  Purist, no.  I want to hear one of those things that you're talking about.  I'll see if I can find one.  All right, just don't tease us.  Alan Snevin, Radio Rewind.  Rewound Radio.  Okay, whatever the fuck it is.  We've got a lot of guests coming in today.  Yes.  Yes.  We've got Brian Regan next.  I believe he's here.  Why is he here?  He's probably promoting a tour.  Because it's 7.54.  But I think he played locally over the weekend.  Yeah, he played over at Westbury. 
[01:32:00]  Westbury.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe he just wants to say hi.  Then we've got a legend coming in today for reals.  Oh, come on.  I'm here every day.  Tim Conway's going to be in the studio.  Holy fuck.  Oh, I remember being a little nothing and he's on that Carol Burnett show.  Oh, oh, yeah.  And didn't you like when they cracked up?  Of course.  I enjoyed that.  Yeah, you know, couldn't hold it in.  I loved how natural it seemed.  Of course.  I want to do a crime drama and have that happen. 
[01:32:30]  They just start laughing.  Yeah, I was always a big fan of the old Carol Burnett show would do that.  So I want to do like a murder mystery where the bodies of a couple are found butchered.  And you see the sergeant laughing.  And then you got the Nick Offerman coming in.  From Parks and Rec.  Yeah, he's very funny.  He's a great character actor.  He talks like that.  Is that his claim to fame?  Kinda.  Yeah, he's got a mustache. 
[01:33:00]  Oh.  You know.  Huh?  A request from Tim Conway's publicist.  Oh, what's that?  Is that we plug my beacon date for this Friday night with Dice.  Oh, right.  Tim's a big fan.  Dice.  And it's this Friday night at 8 o'clock.  That's gotta be selling very well, no?  It is actually.  Well, I'll tell you what's hurt us in sales, why it's not totally sold out, is because it's  the night after Halloween.  And we didn't think of that when we booked it.  Oh, man.  And it's fucking, a lot of people are doing other things. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yes.  I, myself, would have gone, but I'm having my big Halloween gala.  Yeah, it's a big night for that stuff.  We just honestly didn't think, because the theater was booked weeks after for other events.  But, um.  It'll be great.  Oh, I know.  It'll be very close.  By the way, if you're a girl.  I am.  That's coming to my fucking party, don't ask if you could bring your fucking guy friends.  It doesn't work that way.  I don't like guys over my house that I don't know.  You want to be a chick and fucking, uh, uh, come to the party?  That's fine.  Fuck yeah! 
[01:34:00]  Don't that last minute go, oh, can I bring a guy?  I don't know these guys.  I don't want them running around my fucking house.  Absolutely not.  What if they're, uh, it's their boyfriend?  Fuck them!  Not go again!  Then you don't come.  We're trying to get some puss!  What do you want from me?  Fuck yeah!  I don't fucking, uh, want guys coming over that I don't fucking know.  You're inviting her so you can stick that big cock right in your puss!  You're gonna get a deep dick in.  That is the worst of them.  No, it's just, I don't fucking, you know, I don't, if there's girls walking around, that's fine. 
[01:34:30]  And there's gonna be plenty of girls.  You can all fucking get together and yap to each other.  It's fine.  But I don't want some strange dudes walking around my fucking house.  I don't know them.  I kind of know you.  But I don't know the, a guy, I don't want some strange dude.  You don't want male energy there.  No!  You're trying to meet some gals going to the pool?  Is the pool still open?  There's plenty of, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you should have kept it open for Halloween.  I couldn't.  It got way too cold this year.  Oh, boo.  Open it up just for the weekend. 
[01:35:00]  How much for that call?  Oh, boy.  That, uh, well, it's already fucking covered.  I know.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  I know.  Well, there's plenty of other activities that'll be going on, but, um, yeah.  Yeah, stop asking about your dumb fucking boys, boyfriends.  Don't need it.  Got plenty of guys there.  Don't worry about it.  Plenty of dudes.  Bro.  But if you're a dude and want to bring your chick, that's fine.  Dude bros?  Goes one way.  You got any dude bros coming?  I got dude bro.  Man dude bros. 
[01:35:30]  Man, all right.  Dude man bros?  I see Brian Regan walking down the hall.  So why don't we take a break?  Brian Regan next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Watched up dreams, shattered pride.  More because Annie took a hit on the wild side.  Huh. 
[01:36:00]  Just hear the street.  Like Earl said.  Oh man.  Get the street off of that right there.  I feel New York when I am.  Oh yeah.  Feeling it.  Hear a little read.  Thanks Earl.  Yeah.  Hey, what?  What happened?  Oh yeah.  What was this again?  Marky Mark.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh boy.  Sounds like the Marky Mark. 
[01:36:30]  And the Funky Bunch.  That Funky Bunch.  He'll always just be Dirk Diggler to me.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  I like when he plays Mark Wahlberg in his movies.  Yeah, you like that?  That's kind of fun.  Oh my God.  Change your hair at least or something.  That's something.  Try to trick us.  Hey, that's Mark Wahlberg.  Be a Mark Wahlberg in a movie.  I hate when that happens. 
[01:37:00]  There's a few guys like that.  I guess they're that great that they don't have to really do anything else but just show  up as themselves.  Exactly.  Brian Regan's outside the studio.  Yes.  Let's get Brian in here.  Brian Regan.  He's just chatting.  I'm just chatting.  There he is.  Hi, Brian.  Brian Regan, everyone.  How are you doing, man?  Hey.  How you been?  Good.  Good.  What's up, Brian?  Doing all right.  Welcome.  Hardest working man in show business right here.  In the biz. 
[01:37:30]  How you doing, man?  That whole thing hasn't been thrown around a lot.  Hardest working man in show business.  Everybody just...  If you're doing anything in show business, you're the hardest working man in show business.  If you're a little successful, you're working hard.  Look at him.  Right?  Brian.  7,946th hardest working man in show business.  Yeah, you're not the hardest.  You're up there.  I'm up there.  When you consider how many there are, 7,000's not even...  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good. 
[01:38:00]  How you doing?  Look at you.  You look great.  Thank you.  A great head of hair on Brian.  What do you mean you're half asleep?  Yeah.  It's time to perform.  Let's go.  No, I'm half awake.  See?  You've got to be optimistic.  There you go.  Class is half awake.  How was the Westbury gig?  That was fun.  Yeah, huh?  Were you in the round?  In theater in the round deal.  Yeah.  Have you done that, Jim?  I have, yes.  There was a rumor that there were seats behind the big curtain I had.  Oh! 
[01:38:30]  Do they rotate the stage for you, Brian?  I've done those round things a few times, and I've never had them spin the stage.  I don't think I could handle that.  You just walk around.  I just walk around.  Yeah, you can do that yourself, I guess, if you think about it.  But why do you need them to spin the stage for you?  If it's a band, you can't just keep turning the drum set, you know, for the other people.  Right, right.  You've got to, the drummer, like, gets up and just cocks that drum kit 45 degrees. 
[01:39:00]  I remember seeing Yes in the round.  Wow, how was that?  It was Yes.  Who cares?  Now I get to see the drummer.  But the whole band turned, right?  Yeah.  Everyone was turning and spinning, whatever.  Was it cool when they did Roundabout?  Yeah.  You've got to be up on your Yes.  Perfect.  You've got to be up on your Yes to blurt out that type of humor.  That's a popular song.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I saw a picture from Blue Oyster Cult's own Eric Bloom. 
[01:39:30]  Yes.  You took a picture with Eric Bloom at the Westbury gig.  That's right.  Rory, my manager, is a big fan of Blue Oyster Cult.  Yes.  And so he knew Eric Bloom, who came out and checked out the show.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't something the reaper.  Don't fear the reaper.  Don't something the reaper.  So I guess that picture wasn't your request.  No, I don't, you know, we were singing it, but I didn't know that one word.  Don't something the reaper.  Take my hand. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  I was talking to my brother, and he was actually in contact with Eric Bloom about that rumor  that one of the callers called up the other day.  We were talking about Blue Oyster Cult and stuff.  They're always right, these callers.  Did you know mass murderer Joel Rifkin was one of the original guitar players for Blue Oyster  Cult?  Yep.  So, like, my brother's on the phone, and he knows, you know, the guys from Blue Oyster  Cult, and he asks Eric Bloom, and Eric Bloom's like, what? 
[01:40:30]  He goes, no.  He goes, when they arrested him, he had a Blue Oyster Cult poster on his wall.  That's his closing.  And it turned into...  He became...  Yeah, it turned into...  He was a guitar player for Blue Oyster Cult, but, yeah, okay, so it was your manager was  very excited or something.  Yes, yeah.  And it was a fun experience.  Yeah, and then I had a few friends that went and said it was just fucking hilarious.  That's...  You're a master of your craft, Brian.  Brian's always hilarious.  Very nice. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  Ridiculous.  Where are you going to be?  Well, I just did four nights, and I'm in town doing the Letterman thing.  Oh!  Oh...  David?  David.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby Letterman.  It's his podcast.  He's got a podcast.  Bobby Letterman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  That's got to be fucking like 10,000.  How many times have you done Letterman, Brian?  This will be 26.  Wow.  26.  26 times.  Do you do paddle or stand-up and paddle both? 
[01:41:30]  I only do stand-up.  That's a great room.  Have you ever sat down and chatted with him?  A couple of times.  Yeah?  How'd that go?  Was it good?  A couple of times went well, and one time I got a little skittish.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  I just...  Skittish.  Well, I didn't really...  He asked a question that was different than what I expected, so my brain turned shut down.  You can sink on your feet, though.  You're up.  Yeah, but I didn't.  I blew it.  What happened? 
[01:42:00]  I didn't really ask you.  Well, it was supposed to be, are you taking care...  He was supposed to say, are you taking care of yourself?  Oh.  And then I was going to go into my eye doctor stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And he said...  So he didn't realize that it was going into eye doctor stuff, so he said, so are you staying  in shape?  Oh, that...  And in the back of my head, I'm going, well, what does that have to do with eye doctor  stuff?  Oh.  So he goes, so are you staying in shape?  And I said, yeah, I've been going to the eye doctor.  And he goes, yeah, that'll keep you in shape. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, no.  And I did the eye doctor routine, and in my mind, I'm going, I sound like an idiot.  Why would I convey this story?  What does this have to do with what he has?  That sounds very organic.  I don't know what you're asking me, but here's what I'm going to talk about.  So how was the flight across country?  I like peaches.  Yeah, it was really goofy.  Oh, well, hopefully that doesn't happen again. 
[01:43:00]  I know.  I know.  Did you yell at him during spots?  Don't you fuck up my setup like that, daze!  No, no, it wasn't his fault.  It was my fault, man.  I don't think it was...  No, that sounds like his fault.  He undermined your setup.  I want to see this now.  Oh, I would tell him to go fuck himself now.  Oh, no.  What did I bring this up for?  I'm going to show my worst...  No.  I mean, if he's had you back 26 times, you're doing something right for the man.  Absolutely.  There you go.  It's YouTube. 
[01:43:30]  Your whole life is up there.  It's every moment you ever wanted and don't want up there.  It's just amazing.  On your phone, you're pulling up like classic stuff.  I remember when you used to have to think of things.  Who was that actor?  What was that?  I think I saw that person from the commercial in a TV show.  And you would literally sit there and toil for weeks.  Or even in a conversation.  It would be fun at a bar, just hanging around with people to wonder something.  There's no wondering anymore.  There's no wonder.  The wonder lasts an eighth of a second.  I got the answer right here. 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  I want to wonder.  I want to wonder a little bit.  It's taking the wonder away.  Yeah.  The wonder is gone.  It really is.  And then the feeling of satisfaction you got when you were the first one that blurted out  who it was or the right answer.  And everyone's like, oh, it was on the tip of my tongue.  We just got to Google fast.  Yeah.  Now you got to be the fastest Googler.  Googler.  Now you guys are right.  You still get that.  This age stinks being able to look things up.  It was always more fun to go, I'll talk to you tomorrow after I look at the Farmer's  Almanac. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  I hear you.  There's pluses and minuses for the whole thing.  What else have you been up to, Brian?  Yeah.  What are you doing these days?  Not much.  It's been a while.  Just a stand-up comedy thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish I had a lot of big, crazy things to throw out and plug, but I'm plug-free.  What do you do?  You got to do something to keep your sanity on the road.  I mean, you've been doing this for a while. 
[01:45:00]  I sleep.  You just sleep?  You don't go and catch the sights of the cities you're in?  No.  That's not my...  That's not your bag?  I hate when you do a local radio phoner or something like that, and they're like,  oh, which one of your favorite things about our town?  Oh, no, that's...  You know, that's a jab at you.  No, I don't...  They've got to know you don't know.  Or else they're naive, and then you've just got to go, oh, I just love the sights and the...  And the community, the parks. 
[01:45:30]  You've got to go, you know, it's everything.  Or you do what I do and go, I've never been to your stupid town.  Hence the phone call because of lagging ticket sales.  There's Brian in his hotel room Googling Minnesota.  Oh, I do like here.  Right.  Yeah, the hog farms.  I did one, and they said, is this your first time to the town? 
[01:46:00]  And I said, yeah, that's one thing that's fun about doing this is going to places that  have never been before.  Which is not true.  Well, and then I...  Well, that was a lie.  But then I felt weird inside, and then I looked at my calendar, and I was like, oh, man, I was  there last year.  Oh, no.  And I'm thinking, what do these listeners think?  You know, they were at the show, and I'm like, man, I've never been there.  He was here.  He forgot about us.  He forgot about us.  In our village.  Screw him.  Our village. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, their village.  I'm playing villages now.  Does he know that our number one export is toffee?  No.  They're all insulted.  That's weird.  So you sleep.  A lot of comics, though, just hang out in the hotel room, sleep.  That seems like a kind of weird existence, though.  How much social interaction are you really getting?  My nickname in college was Rip for Rip Van Winkle.  Oh, okay.  I just slept all the time. 
[01:47:00]  You're ripping farts in the classroom.  Exactly.  Ripping dresses off at knife points.  I don't want to go to Jack the Ripper route.  I want to sleep under a tree route with a big beard.  Look out for Rip, ladies.  It hangs out by the park.  I think it would be great to travel like you guys do.  But after a while, you've been to these cities so many times, there's nothing else to check  out, right?  Yeah.  So then you're just happy to get a nice hotel and a nice bed, I guess. 
[01:47:30]  You still live in Vegas, right?  Yes.  You come out of Vegas or New York, it's like there's so much for other cities to compete  with the stimulation of what you can see just where you live.  It's hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was in Vegas over the summer.  It was fucking nice.  Yeah.  I had so much fun.  Went down there and rented some of those machine guns.  Just fired those off at the range.  What a blast Vegas is.  I've been there 10 years.  I haven't shot a machine gun yet.  Oh, that's great.  What are you waiting for?  The guy's like, here you go.  Fire this one off.  I'm like, this is great. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  We have plenty of guns for you here.  You can fire wherever you want.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  It's Vegas.  It's the Wild West.  You know, I've been trying, you know, the whole gun controversy.  Oh, sure.  I've been trying to understand the difference between an assault weapon and a non-assault  weapon.  Right.  And anytime anybody explains it on TV, I'm more confused after the explanation.  Yeah.  It's always said, like, condescendingly, you got these guys thinking that a triple action 
[01:48:30]  single pull tug 44 magazine clip is the same as a 300 single bolt double action.  That's like saying a 44-7-3-8-42 with a Colt revolver twist is going to be any different  than a 300 single bolt action double clip.  Well, thanks for clarifying that.  That was the sticky point right there.  That's what I didn't understand.  Thanks for straightening me out on that. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, shit.  That's exactly what it sounds like.  Fucking yelling at each other on the news.  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  How often do you get back to Vegas a year?  A lot.  A lot, yeah.  Every weekend, right?  Well, during the week.  Yeah.  Recharge at the home base.  Uh-huh.  Got the kiddos back there.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  How's that going, raising the kids?  It's good.  It's fun?  Yeah.  A little boy is 14.  A girl just turned 10. 
[01:49:30]  Jesus.  Wow, that went fast.  Yeah.  That did go fast.  My goodness.  He's as tall as I am.  No.  Wow.  And it's weird, you know, because he's like a little boy still in his heart and soul.  And, you know, I say, hey, man, it's time to go to bed.  And he goes, in a man's voice now, okay.  And then he goes to bed.  And I'm like, all he's got to do is say, I don't think so.  He doesn't know that yet.  Right.  All he's got to say is, I don't think so.  And then he gets to stay up as long as he wants. 
[01:50:00]  What are you going to do about it?  Yeah, what am I going to do?  All right, well, go to bed when you think you should, I guess.  14 as tall as you already.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  What's in the food?  What's going on?  Is he an athlete?  Not, yeah, he's more in the video game thing.  Ah, yes.  He likes that whole world.  Visual athletics.  Yeah.  That's what I like.  He played, I played something with him, Skyrim or something.  Oh, yeah, Skyrim.  He's in all that stuff.  And, you know, you spend 35 minutes creating a character. 
[01:50:30]  You know, it's like, you want your eyes to be sort of round or kind of round or you want  them blue, you want them hazel.  I just want to shoot things.  You know, so I finally create whatever this character is.  And then the very first thing you do in this game anyway, is you go over and the guy goes,  come over here.  You're about to be beheaded.  And I'm like, I just spent 45 minutes creating this guy.  You're going to chop my head off?  I just did my hair. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, created my hair.  Created my hair and everything.  You're going to chop it off?  If I knew I would have created the guy with a thicker neck.  How wide can I make his neck?  And then they have some eagle swoop in and save yourself.  Oh, thank God for that.  And then the game continues.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want the Skyrim people getting mad at me going, hey, no, we're not going to sell  any Skyrim games.  Because people think it just ends with you getting beheaded.  It's the weirdest thing.  You've wasted time on your character. 
[01:51:30]  The end.  Skyrim 2 coming soon.  What a great selling point that is, though.  See Brian Regan be beheaded.  I want to buy the game just to see that.  Yes.  He probably sold more games for that.  You don't get to see that.  What are his interests outside of video games?  Do you like comedy and stuff?  He said they're both funny.  My boy and my girl are both funny.  They make me laugh.  And yeah, you know.  It's cool.  That is one of my favorite experiences on stage one time was just out there doing my 
[01:52:00]  thing.  And I looked back and he was sitting in a place where I could see him and he was laughing  hard at me.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  It was like one of the best feelings I ever had on stage, you know.  Damn.  Yeah.  What was the bit?  Do you remember?  Hope it wasn't some awful bit about killing your parents.  You're right, John.  He's laughing his ass off.  You're pointing out, why wait for the money when you can kill them now while you're young 
[01:52:30]  and enjoy it?  Good point.  Let's go back and watch and take.  Wow.  That's pretty cool to hear.  You've seen it all and that's what got you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you dating?  My girlfriend is here.  Whoa.  You just pointed to Sam.  What is that?  My girlfriend.  I didn't even know.  My goodness.  My right is my girlfriend.  Yeah.  All right.  Good for Brian.  That's cool.  How'd you meet?  We met at Ron Schock. 
[01:53:00]  He's a comedian.  Yeah.  He's a funeral.  Gee.  Wow.  I like the way his fucking brain operates.  Yeah, really.  Fuck yeah.  Get them when they're sad.  Ron Schock.  Very, very funny guy.  He was one of the outlaws of comedy from Houston.  And he was living in Las Vegas at the time and, you know, passed away about a year ago.  And I went to the service, not to the services, but there was a get together that night for  any people in the comedy industry that, you know, wanted to show their respects.  And just because he was another comedian, I wanted to go. 
[01:53:30]  And she had a connection, too.  She knew his wife.  And so that's where we met.  Wow.  Hey.  I never knew Ron Schock.  I hear he's a nice guy and a very funny dude.  I didn't know him.  I mean, I knew of him.  Just went for the chicks.  Yeah.  At the funerals for the broads.  By the way, if you said that your girlfriend now was Ron Schock's ex, you would have been  my hero forever.  No, no, no, no.  I would have worn for the broads.  Geez.  At the funerals.  Oh, gee.  Well, that's cool.  How is that, jumping back into the dating world? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Yeah?  You know?  He's like a same watch.  She's in the other room.  No, I know.  It's just, you know, not graphic details.  She's great, but the other chicks in the meeting are phenomenal.  Exactly.  No, no.  I'm joking.  Yeah.  It's all good, yeah.  Is she from Vegas?  Well, she lives in Vegas, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I know what that just meant.  So you talked earlier about...  Okay, yes.  No, about hitting towns and stuff like that.  Right, yeah, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  She wants to do that.  Oh, really?  See, I want to sleep in, and she's like, let's wake up and do stuff.  Let's wake up and do stuff?  Oh, boy.  This ain't going to last.  Well, we expect our girlfriends to want to sit there and watch our third horseshit show  in a row.  Like, you saw the Friday, you saw the early show Saturday.  What do you mean you don't want to watch the late show Saturday, too?  I'm brilliant.  Look at the people laugh every show.  Oh, boy.  There's a fucking woman's awe of comedy wear off two weekends on the road, and they're 
[01:55:00]  fucking done with it.  They're finished.  You mind if I fly back home and pack?  She hangs in there.  That's good.  How long?  How long have you been hanging out?  A little over a year now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you're in that magic, the magic portion of the relationship.  I love that.  Right?  We hold hands.  Oh, it's adorable.  It's adorable.  Make out.  Just open display.  Brian makes out.  I put, we were at the movies a couple weeks ago, and I put my arm around her. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  It's pretty smooth.  That's nice.  That's good.  Did you do the old?  We're going to see where this takes us.  You'll hollow out the popcorn bucket routine.  That old gag.  Has anyone actually done that?  No.  You think?  Yeah.  You think someone has tried that?  Of course.  Goofy bit.  What was that, from Diner?  Yeah.  Was it? 
[01:56:00]  Was it Diner?  I don't know.  It's an old gag.  It's been around for a long time.  It wasn't a movie.  It wasn't a movie.  Yeah, it wasn't.  Absolutely.  It wasn't a movie.  What movie were you going to see?  What have you seen lately?  Gravity?  I haven't seen Gravity yet.  It's terrific.  Saw Lincoln.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That's a great one to take a woman to.  Yeah, you want her to hate you.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to put my arm around her.  Let's take a nap.  I just want you to know I'm anti-slavery.  And you know if she's smart or not, if she's going, what happens at the end of this? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I don't want to ruin it for her.  Budinsky gets his.  I wanted to like that movie, but that was long.  Oh, gosh.  Why are they making movies this long now?  I thought an hour and a half was sort of the deal.  It was perfect, right?  Yeah.  Now they're all two, these epics, and it's like, I don't need an epic.  Every movie I used to watch on TV, when it was on like Channel 5 or Channel 11, those  crappy channels, was 90 minutes long.  And that was with commercials. 
[01:57:00]  Remember the westerns especially would take all afternoon.  Westerns.  Sci-fis.  But it would be a two, three hour, fuck it.  You would have to commit with the commercials.  So those are like How the West Was Won, like those epic westerns and stuff.  But if you were just watching some Godzilla movie, 90 fucking minutes.  That was it.  With commercials?  With commercials.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Bam, 90 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's, you know, you go to the theater, you've got to invest four fucking hours.  And like, how long? 
[01:57:30]  Gravity wasn't long.  90 minutes.  That was very brief, actually.  There you go.  That was.  It was great.  A good length for a movie, though.  It was really good.  I would like to see that.  That seems like a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what a...  It's visually stunning.  But the story, I don't know.  Sandra Bullock, she's the same girl from the bus.  In space, though.  In space?  That's my review.  That's my big review.  Well, that's fucking...  Thumb down?  No.  You don't like it as much as the rest of us.  Go see it, because it looks great. 
[01:58:00]  It's like cutting-edge fucking filmmaking.  You've got to see the 3D and...  Yeah.  The IMAX and all that crap.  Like the Titanic, you know?  Right.  I like the special effects.  I didn't need the first half of the Titanic.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I could have gone in halfway through and just watched that thing sink.  The sinking was great, right?  The love story stuff.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  That stuff's yucky.  Right.  That stuff's icky.  That stuff's icky.  So does your lovely young lady have cooties? 
[01:58:30]  You don't like cooties?  No.  No, of course not.  Brian's doing good.  I like that.  Got a girl who's working like a mother...  Well, this is great.  Do you do any acting work at all?  Because Brian's like a pure comic.  I like his career.  It's like a Carlin career.  But there's maybe a little bit of acting if you want to, but you fucking just sell and  do great fucking stand-up.  Well, that's very, very kind.  I did a movie.  My only movie role ever here.  There's the Chris Rock thing. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, right.  We saw you walking down the hall.  We did a little of that.  You changed when that happened, too.  I said hi to Brian.  He didn't even look at me.  Who's this?  He's headed to my dressing room.  Get this guy away from me.  I'm hoping that they don't cut me out.  We'll see.  Have you been offered...  It's the only thing I've ever been in.  You had to have been offered roles in, like, you know.  No?  Why aren't you offered stuff?  That's so weird.  I don't know.  Playing the wacky teacher in some high school movie.  Hey.  Welcome to social studies. 
[01:59:30]  I just don't gravitate that way.  No, huh?  Do you like it, the Chris Rock experience?  Oh, man.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  I played a radio producer.  All right.  And I'm trying to get him to do a liner, and I keep telling him that he's not being funny  enough, which we can relate to.  Sure.  You know, and he'll do it, and I'll go, ah, that's good, but if you could just kind of  make it funny, you know, and he gets increasingly pissed off at me.  Of course.  Who wants to hear that?  Right.  Make it funny.  What do you fucking mean?  Shut up.  I mean, as I'm doing my stuff, I'm relating to his end of it going, because it's happened 
[02:00:00]  to me so many times.  Have fun with it.  Oh.  Yeah.  I did a morning TV thing one time, and they're like, we're going to go to you right before  we go to commercial for 30 seconds.  Just be really funny, okay?  What?  What do you want me to do?  Just be really funny.  Just be really funny.  It's Brian!  How much?  20 seconds of...  They're going to be talking to me when we come back. 
[02:00:30]  Don't you?  Don't you?  Don't you?  You just don't just that.  Like we have a light switch, you know, a funny switch.  Tell them to do the news for 30 seconds without the teleprompter on and see where they go.  Those bastards.  See, I'm all serious now.  Yeah, but I...  Hey, you tell them, Brian.  Right.  Yes.  I like when they've got to do the...  They go from the lighthearted story to the serious story, but don't realize how serious  the next story is, so they're laughing coming out of the previous one going, boy, that 
[02:01:00]  sure sounds like one crazy Thanksgiving dinner.  47 people were killed today.  It's like, wow, man, you had to switch fast.  You'd think they'd take that into consideration.  Yeah, right.  Kind of soften it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of ease into it.  Maybe something in between.  Right.  Something in between there.  Right.  It's too harsh a transition.  Oh, boy, did I fucking...  Just reminded me, I did a cancer benefit last night for children's cancer. 
[02:01:30]  For it?  Well, yes, I'm pro-cancer.  I hate the fact that we're fighting it.  No, it was a benefit, I guess, for fighting for kids with cancer.  And so I'm doing it, and the host is going to bring me on, and she says something  like, uh, I forget the wording she used, but she's like, oh, your next act is like an  amazing killer.  Oh, no.  It was a compliment.  It was a compliment.  She was being nice.  Oh.  And no one caught it, so I walked on and said, an amazing killer.  I don't know if you should say that at this benefit.  And it got a zero.  No! 
[02:02:00]  No!  No, see, that's...  It got a fucking zero.  Look how to address it.  That was smart.  I think you were popping the bubble.  Yeah, just being silly.  Oh, my God.  You got a good laugh.  Zero.  I was like, oh, my...  It was truly uncomfortable, and I'm like, ah.  Did you turn them around?  Yeah, it turned out to be a really good set, but I just went really slow.  Like, that was the way it was supposed to be, but it was like one of those awkward transitions  where it was a dead, absolute, uncomfortable bomb. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, that's really uncomfortable, because that's got, like, something behind the uncomfortability  that's tragic.  It's your first moment on stage, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You're trying to get your foot in the door, and it's like, here's my first comment.  Whoa.  Nothing.  Nothing is going on.  And a zero with purpose.  Yeah, yeah.  Terrible.  Wow.  And it's the more you commit, too.  You know, like, sometimes if it's new like that, you want to just make it sound like you're  not really committed to it, so if it doesn't work... 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  But if you commit to it, and they know you committed to it, it's just very strange.  Yeah, man.  I had to put my water down.  Because in Gotham, you don't have anything to put your water right on to.  You have to step back a little bit, so...  Oh, boy.  Ouch.  That almost ruined my month.  I heard a cricket during a show.  That's a true story.  You did.  I did a joke.  I was bombing at a corporate gig, and I did a joke, and a window was open near the stage,  and I heard a... 
[02:03:30]  And that's like the proverbial thing.  Disheartening.  Aaron Crick.  Yes.  Yeah.  My punchline, then the ouch.  And the audience heard it, too.  And I was like, wow.  It's like funny.  That's funny.  He brings a cricket for when he bombs.  It's amazing.  I need a cricket wrangler.  Ryan and a cricket.  You're really bombing?  I can't picture you bombing at a cricket.  Never.  You're perfect for them.  Well, I mean, I appreciate it.  But, yeah, I mean, everybody's going to have their bad shows, you know? 
[02:04:00]  And when I bomb, I bomb big.  Wow.  Because I'm physical, you know?  I mean, like, if you're just a monologist, you can kind of act like, well, that wasn't  supposed to get a laugh anyway.  I can't pretend that.  I'm up there, moving around.  If it's just the room is filled with silence, it's just nothing but awkward.  Do you know, I would give a year of my life to see that for an hour.  Oh, wow.  The joy of watching that.  You would love that.  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:30]  Squirming in front of a crowd.  Because, again, Brian, I can't picture it happening.  I don't think I've ever seen Brian in a bad set, ever.  That's nice.  Pantomiming, eating, and fucking watching people just looking on with nothing.  It's going to happen.  Wow.  I did one show one time and just got nothing, you know?  It was like an hour-long set in front of a bunch of older guys, like at a golf club,  you know what I mean?  Older guys without their wives, and then somebody thinks it's a good idea to bring a clean comedian  and to a bunch of guys who are drinking after rounds of golf. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  So I got nothing.  And what made it worse is they were incredibly polite.  Like, they paid attention.  Like, I would rather they all start talking.  I would rather they just start talking, and then you go, oh, they're not paying attention.  And I'm like, no, they're paying attention.  They're not hearing my genius.  And rejecting it.  And they're rejecting me.  And I got off stage, and this guy came up to me and handed me a glass of scotch and said,  I thought you might want this. 
[02:05:30]  I was like, you are right.  You are right.  They were probably all laughed out, too, golfing with just guys.  They're joking.  Because they know how to joke.  Laughing out on the golf course.  When they're out there, right?  And then they get back, and it's like, ah.  They all got a joke or two.  They're all chameleons out there on the course.  Of course.  That's what an agent or a publicist would say on the way back to the hotel.  They're probably all laughed out.  They're laughed out.  You'll have to go to sleep with that.  They were laughed out.  They were, right.  I believe that. 
[02:06:00]  How do you have the gig go?  Ending point.  They were laughed out.  They were laughed out.  I believe that.  You know what that means, right?  Wow.  So have they taken up pitchforks and torches for Criss Angel in Vegas yet?  To chase him out of town?  I haven't seen that show yet.  No?  Brian doesn't want to tackle that one.  I know.  I hear he's doing good.  We don't like him anymore.  Oh.  Brian's just like, yeah, well, I love him.  He's part of our economy there in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
[02:06:30]  Come on out to Las Vegas.  You can't go after the Las Vegas guys.  They all stick together.  Even if they don't know each other.  Oh, I know.  That's why I said it.  Part of a community.  Yeah.  Vegas is really building up.  My God.  He goes shopping with Penn.  Yeah, probably.  He's like, hey, let's get all of those Vegas people.  I saw, what's his name?  David Copperfield.  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  That was that good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was he doing?  Buying duct tape and a fucking ticket to an island?  Jesus.  That island.  Wow. 
[02:07:00]  He has an island.  He has an island, which...  I saw Copperfield.  His act doesn't hold up.  What?  I don't like it at all.  Oh, come on, Brian.  It's an illusion.  Yeah, it's an illusion.  It's an illusion.  It takes you out of the illusion when you see that the shadows are moving during his bit.  Uh-oh.  Some lighting tech's got to get fired.  Well, no.  He got lazy.  He filmed everything on a beach.  But instead of coming back every day for a while where the shadows would be the exact same,  he decided, oh, screw that and did a whole day of taping.  So the shadow from the palm tree is way over here now when it was supposed to all happen instantly. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, you can't depend on the sun.  No.  He got a little lazy in his illusions, Brian.  Do you catch many Vegas shows?  I guess not, right?  You probably don't do a lot of Vegas-y things.  I saw, geez, Don Rickles.  Oh.  He doesn't have a regular show in Vegas, but he performed there recently.  And, geez, it's just amazing watching somebody that's been around a long time, a legend, 
[02:08:00]  going up there, doing his thing, and that was pretty cool.  Yeah.  I'd like to see that.  Pat Cooper said he should retire.  Remember that?  Don Rickles should?  Yeah.  Well, Pat Cooper was yelling on our show.  Pat Cooper.  He retired on our show.  I don't want to say, Don Rickles!  Pass this prime!  Yeah.  It's degrading!  You know what it was said?  I saw him two days after our appearance, I forgot to tell you guys, on the street, because  we see him all the time.  He didn't recognize you.  Oh, he recognized me immediately, and I go, What are you doing?  He goes, I'm going home to make lasagna. 
[02:08:30]  And I'm like, Will you go and do stand-up?  What are you doing?  Stop doing Italian shit.  We get it.  But he had two grocery bags.  That's all he does.  From Fairway.  He's rolling a giant meatball home.  He had two bags of groceries.  He was going home to make lasagna.  Two days after he retired on our show.  He's not doing stand-up anymore, which is crazy.  You guys have Tim Conway coming in?  In a few minutes.  Oh, yeah.  I saw the book.  I grabbed one of the books, man.  Yes.  Tim Conway.  That's cool. 
[02:09:00]  That's a comedy legend right there.  Is he performing?  What's he doing?  He's got a book.  He's got a book out.  It's called What's So Funny?  My Hilarious Life.  And I guess he's promoting the paperback, unless this is the entire, unless this is the first.  I don't know.  But he was a blast to watch, man.  Carol Burnett.  And he's got a son who does a radio show.  Yeah, he does.  Tim Conway Jr. out in LA.  Yeah, he does a talk show.  Tim Conway Jr.  Tim Conway Jr.  That's got to be rough to live up to the name, you know?  He's actually...  He's going to live up to that. 
[02:09:30]  Is he good?  Yeah, I've been on his show a few times.  Oh.  Good guy.  Oh, would you rather be on his show right now, Brian?  Yeah, what are you saying?  That's why I've got to get out of here.  I've got to go do the Tim Conway Jr. show.  What are you saying?  He actually does a good job.  He actually has much better questions.  Yeah, he does a good job at the radio.  You might want to look into that.  He does some new technique.  It's called preparation.  Right.  Oh, that's him right there?  Oh, there he is.  Let me see him, Sam.  I can't see.  He's got a Tim Conway look to him. 
[02:10:00]  Looks like Kevin Pollack a little bit.  Yeah, he doesn't look like this old man, really.  A little bit.  Looks like Lou Reed.  No, that's Lou Reed.  What do you think of Lou Reed dying there, Brian?  Oh, it's tragic.  Tragic, right?  Brian's thumbs up.  There's no reason for this.  I don't know what else to say.  Brian, probably not a Lou Reed fan.  I know.  I'm not either.  I can't stand all the accolades he's getting today because he's dead.  And the African-American girls go...  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  That guy.  Right, right. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that's him.  Nah, I say fuck him.  Wow.  Nah, I'm just...  Well, he's getting all these accolades from people that never even gave a shit about him until he died.  You know?  Wow.  The guy from...  You know, you get other famous guys that were famous back in what I call the day.  And then they die and they get nothing.  But it's cool to like Lou Reed.  So, you know, if you want to seem cool, seem like you're really upset about Lou Reed dying. 
[02:11:00]  And people will be like, wow, that guy's cool.  You got it, man.  Yeah.  Truth in lyrics.  That's right.  He's an American poet.  Shut up.  He's not.  Dr. Seuss was.  It fucking doesn't rhyme.  It's not a poem as far as I'm concerned.  I like that.  Absolutely.  What a hack.  Dr. Seuss...  I mean, I love most of it, but like, I think later he started just kind of like coasting.  Because there's one book that I read, it's like, is that a Zabel on the table? 
[02:11:30]  Is that a belf on the shelf?  And going, come on, are you cranking these out every five minutes?  Come on.  It's not even worse.  Don't go back to all the places you'll go.  That was a good one.  You can't just make a belf on it.  There's no such thing as a belf.  He's just making up shit that rhymes with other real shit.  You just buy stuff and you just rhyme it.  It's a Zendo in the window.  No, there's no such thing as a Zendo. 
[02:12:00]  Come on, Dr. Seuss.  Put a little effort into this.  Very good.  You passed that point now.  You don't have to read books.  No, I don't have to read anymore.  You don't have to read anymore.  Well, your bid on kids' books is terrific because now I've got to read the books of the kids and I can't believe how much they fucking get for these books.  Did you buy the clock?  I thought a hilarious Brian Regan bid, obviously, but I'm like, well, he's obviously exaggerating. 
[02:12:30]  But no, it's just like that.  And they're three pages long and there's nothing.  You know, you see all these people releasing children's books now.  I'm like, you can see why, you know?  It's like, so I got an afternoon to kill.  I'll write a kid's book.  Yeah, we just had on John Lithgow.  Well, Lithgow, as I'm told.  He's got eight kids' books out.  Oh, a bunch.  Henry Winkler comes on.  He's got a whole... 
[02:13:00]  There are more young adults, like 12, 13-year-olds.  Oh, yeah, that's a little different.  There's a lot more words.  Is it Henry Winkler or the Fonz?  We've had the...  Is it Henry?  We've never had the Fonz on.  Hank Winkler.  We've had Hank on.  Yeah.  He's a little different.  I was Hank.  Yeah, well...  We like him.  Not quite Henry Winkler.  Even if the Fonz, he was kind of a fucking dork.  He'd look back on it.  Who thinks that's cool?  He'd fold the chair, help it out.  Eating your veggies is cool.  What guy helps out from the Cunningham's house?  That's true.  Hey, Mr. C, that looks heavy. 
[02:13:30]  What are you doing?  You should be fucking Joanie in the mouth.  If you're cool, right?  If you're cool...  If you're cool, that's what you do.  You don't fold up the chairs.  You're going to be mushing Mr. C's tits with a rolling pin.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's a good point, though.  It is.  Let someone else fold up the chairs.  I watch a show, and I never thought to get angry about it.  Not so.  Jim watches a show, and knows that there's some anger in you.  I'm just observing. 
[02:14:00]  Holy shit.  Ozzy's not cool.  I do like the fact that he would hold meetings in the bathroom,  make fucking Patsy and Ralph Malfe smell his dumps  while they ask for advice over the stall door.  That's a power trip.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  We got to go in there, Fonz.  This is where the meetings are held.  Never saw it that way.  Cut in here.  My office. 
[02:14:30]  There he is.  Yeah, Richie's squatting, peeking through that little hole that the Fonz drilled.  Smells like amyl nitrate.  Fonz is doing poppers.  Twisty.  Holy shit.  Twisty.  Oh, boy.  That's Twisty.  That's Twisty.  I think my review of that.  People are asking if you'll ever do a TV show.  Well, I think you kind of answered that.  You'd be perfect for TV.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  You know.  It's not...  You can't just decide on your own that you're going to do a TV show.  Other people have to weigh in on that.  Yeah, that's true.  That's the part I don't like.  Yeah, a lot more people would have TV shows if it was that easy.  I know.  You know, I've decided...  I'm going to do that right now.  I'm going to be on at 8 o'clock tonight, prime time.  I've been thinking.  No, it's an honor that people would think that.  Absolutely.  You know what?  It's hard when you're a stand-up and you have complete autonomy.  It's hard to want to give that up.  You know, and all of a sudden be part of a team. 
[02:15:30]  I don't want to be on a team.  You look like Louis C.K. did it.  I don't know how people walk into these networks and get complete creative freedom on their first or second project.  Yeah.  You know, it's some kind of Jedi mind shit he's working.  Because then you hear from other people, it's like, I just gave away my dignity and my pride and everything that I felt was important to me in life for this show.  And they fucked it up.  Well, they have to want you more than you need them.  And he was willing to walk. 
[02:16:00]  If you're willing to walk, most times you'll have to walk.  But there will be the occasional time where we're like, nah, we really want you more than you need us, so we'll let you do what you want to do.  And that's how he did it.  Because they wanted him badly, and he would have walked.  Yeah, he's at that level where he could have just said, hey, no, I want to do it my way.  And then someone else would give it to him his way.  Oh.  Yeah.  I wish more networks would start doing that.  If you want to do something, go do it, and we'll get out of your way.  Yeah, and then if it's good, we'll keep it on. 
[02:16:30]  If it sucks, you're gone.  But at least, you know.  But we'll stay out of the creative process.  But they have to justify their jobs.  Like, if that was the case, then, you know.  I always wondered, if you put up a set of bleachers, right, you put a blank canvas, right, and then you put Van Gogh, and then you put a set of bleachers with network executives in them, what would end up on that canvas?  Put some more blue in there. 
[02:17:00]  I don't want any blue.  Do the flowers have to be so...  Can you make the flowers a little different?  Let him paint.  Let him paint.  No, no, we can't make the flowers any distance.  They test it well.  So the flowers...  Yeah, yeah, the flowers.  People like...  People want blue flowers.  Yeah.  They want blue flowers.  There's going to be a...  There might be a problem here if you don't do it the way we want you to do it. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Ah, you poor bastards.  My show's coming close to getting picked up.  Yeah, yeah?  Where I play the detective who doesn't get along with his sergeant.  And my black partner's a lot smarter than I am.  Do you do things like your own way?  I certainly do.  A lot of times every week I have to walk in and I'm like, give me your badge.  I'm like, ah, take it.  Remember watching an episode of Cannon?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Cannon.  Yeah, he went to go talk to some, you know, sergeant at another district and there was a 
[02:18:00]  guy out front saying, well, you can't go back there because you don't have a meeting.  You're not on the list.  And he just went past the guy and said, you got a guy out at that desk who thinks going  by the book is the way things should be done.  Well, shouldn't they be done that way?  Shouldn't they be done that way?  He's not supposed to let you in.  That's why he's there.  I saw Cannon on an episode chasing some young guy through the woods and he's running and 
[02:18:30]  you know, he wouldn't get 30 feet before he just fell down or at least be winded.  Then he pulls out that snub nose 38, holds it down by his hip.  All right, freeze.  There's no finesse in how he apprehends somebody.  Those are great shows, though.  Quinn Martin production.  What was the one with Captain Kirk? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, TJ Hooker.  TJ Hooker.  Yeah.  There was one where he's in the police station with the other cops and there's a desk with  a phone, one phone, and then these other people called the police.  And that was the phone that rang.  For the police.  Yeah, those three.  But police.  What?  There's something wrong.  We'll be right there.  There's like a phone that just rings that they just pick up.  Yeah, no switchboard operator, no 911 operator. 
[02:19:30]  That's what happens when you call the police.  The police.  TJ Hooker was great because it was the same Captain Kirk delivery, but he's a cop.  He's like, you're done, scum.  Slide across the hood of his car.  Pull his gun out.  Okay, freeze.  I used to, I loved Shatner's acting in that.  It's fantastic.  He's great, man.  Then they had the young upstart partner that he had.  You know, and TJ had to teach him the ropes.  How that show lasted so long.  And then he was on, did he used to do Rescue 911? 
[02:20:00]  No.  Shatner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rescue 911.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, definitely.  I remember every episode, he was like, time is of the essence.  Hypothermia is setting in.  It was every episode, somebody in the water.  It could be an inch of water.  Time is of the essence.  Hypothermia is setting in.  He called 911.  Oh, you smell nice.  Thank you.  You smell really good, yeah.  I noticed that, too.  What are you wearing?  You smell delightful.  What are you wearing?  What is that?  I got it at Whole Foods. 
[02:20:30]  It's called Lotus.  Lotus?  Really?  At Whole Foods?  Oh, it's not a spray perfume?  No, it's just a little oil you get at Whole Foods.  Damn good.  Thank you.  Took us out of the Brian Regan interview.  Somebody smells like Lotus.  That's all it takes with us.  You smell good!  We forgot where we are.  I was like, oh my god, okay.  You smell like a fun booth at the Wren Fair.  Right at the Wren Stocks Fair?  Yeah.  I don't go to that shit. 
[02:21:00]  The fun booth with the incense.  I think we got a break just because Tim Conway, I think, is here.  Oh, man.  Brian, you can stick around for Tim Conway.  We're not kicking you out, sir.  It's up to you.  I would love to at least say hello to him.  Yeah, so, okay.  Like the Tonight Show.  You're going to move over to Mike?  Yeah, I don't want to take you.  You move over to Mike.  Oh, just young Sam.  What this fucker is?  Yeah.  The seat warmer.  Brian, you're promoting anything?  Nope.  Not really, huh?  Wow.  Letterman tonight.  Letterman will be actually this coming Friday.  This coming Friday.  Oh, taping on Thursday.  Because many of these people out there, they don't watch Letterman, but they should this 
[02:21:30]  Friday because our pal Brian Regan will be on.  Yes.  Definitely check that out.  Thank you.  And we got Tim Conway next.  Stay there.  After this message, we'll be right back.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN at 3 Show.  All right, this is very, very cool. 
[02:22:00]  We got Brian Regan in studio, and he's sticking around, and we're very happy that he is.  Don't forget, Brian Regan's going to be on Letterman this Friday night.  Ah, Mr. Tim Conway.  And a legend is now walking in the studio.  That's young Travis right there.  Wow.  Hi, Tim Conway.  Anthony, how are you, sir?  Tim Conway.  Here's Opie.  A pleasure, sir.  Hi, Opie.  All right, buddy.  There's, of course, Jim Norton.  Hi, Tim.  Jim.  If you want to sit down, we're on, too.  Comic, and of course...  And that's Brian Regan over there.  Another comic over here, Brian Regan. 
[02:22:30]  Take a seat right there in the middle.  Nice to see me, isn't it?  Yeah, it certainly is, sir.  It really is nice to see you.  The seat of honor right there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Tim Conway.  Who would have thought?  Right here.  I know.  Who would have thought?  You know?  Cool.  Who would have thought?  I was just watching McHale's Navy recently.  Oh, yeah.  All those shows making resurgence on, like, MeTV and other cable channels all over.  There's a...  And, my God, that was quite politically incorrect for nowadays. 
[02:23:00]  But back then, you could have the hijacked Japanese guy on the ship with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one cared.  The Jap.  The Jap, they called him.  Yeah, they would.  It was amazing.  But, boy, what a funny, slapstick-y show.  Yeah.  It was pretty much like the real army.  Right.  Just like it, right?  During World War II, they were doing that stuff.  Yeah.  Hijinks and shenanigans with old lead bottom. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  I was in the Army for two years and two weeks.  When you're a court-martial, they put that time on the...  Oh, they actually add that on.  Oh, that's handy.  I was on guard duty one night, and I knew the lieutenant was coming around.  And, it's the most boring thing to sit there from 12 to 6 in the morning with nothing to do.  So, I took...  I left my post, as you should never do, and I went in the back of a car and took a little nap. 
[02:24:00]  And, I forgot when I got out my rifle, which the Army is really annoying about that.  Yeah.  They give you a rifle, and they say, clean it, sleep with it, and all that crap.  Well, anyway, so, I had to go on my post as our guard duty, and the lieutenant was supposed to come around.  And, I realized I didn't have a rifle.  So, I went in the trash bin and hooked out a long neon tube light. 
[02:24:30]  And, as he came around the corner, I said, halt, advance, and be recognized.  Give me your name, rank, and serial number.  And, he started to do that, and he looked at me, and he said,  What is that?  And, I said, it's a light bulb, and if you come any closer, I'll turn it on.  So, I spent another two weeks.  Another two weeks in the service.  In the rocks, yeah.  Was there anything you guys wanted to do on Cal Burnett that you couldn't do because of network standards? 
[02:25:00]  Or things that they wouldn't let her do?  Because, 67, 68, or whatever, it was a lot different than today.  I'm sorry, you spoke a little too fast.  I do that a lot whenever.  No, no.  We had no trouble with that at all.  Well, Carol used to swear a lot on the air, but for the most of us.  I remember that.  It was shocking as a child to hear F-bombs being dropped like that.  Yeah.  Embarrassed the whole.  No, we never had trouble with that.  Did you guys go out live? 
[02:25:30]  Or was it a pre-tape?  It's hard to go out dead.  I swear to God.  Yes.  No, we were live.  Yeah.  Everything was live in those days.  Well, this is live, isn't it?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Unfortunately.  But there's something that feels really frightening about going out live like that.  And I guess it also, whatever the moment is, you kind of have to go with it.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  I just wanted to explain to Tim Conway how comedy was done.  What's wrong with me?  Why don't I shut up?  I wasn't listening. 
[02:26:00]  How did you get involved with Carol back then?  I met her once.  Not you.  I was on the Gary Moore show in New York, and she happened to be on the Gary Moore show  at the same time.  And so when she got her own show, she said, I never want to have Tim Conway on the show.  Keep him off.  I showed up anyway.  And she liked what I did.  And so I was there 11 years.  Wow.  You were there right from the start, right? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Well, no.  They didn't know it, but I was.  Oh, okay.  You were kind of lurking behind the scenes, waiting.  Yeah.  I was pretty much.  Well, the first year I guested for three shows, and then they did 33 shows a year.  And I did 32, and then I would save that last week in case I was a guest host on somebody  else's show.  And they said, this is stupid.  You know, do all 33. 
[02:27:00]  And I said, well, I have to leave that week open.  And then I would do their show.  What were you doing before the television part of your career?  I wanted to be a jockey.  So I was at Randall Park in Cleveland, trying to do that, but corset this way, even.  The corset is just getting it off.  You could have been a jockey, for God's sake.  You think so?  Yeah.  When my comedy career is going, I might as well give it a shot. 
[02:27:30]  That's what you're going to be plugging next time.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm going to be in Belmont.  Pimlico.  Jim Norton's going to be over at Churchill Downs.  Wow.  Yeah, because I wonder how you got into television.  How would you make the jump from...  What type of comedy were you doing outside of television?  I was dyslexic.  So when I got up to read, people would laugh at me, and they thought that was hysterical. 
[02:28:00]  So eventually that led to my just entertaining people.  That's bullying now.  Yeah.  Isn't it, though?  Yeah.  And that started your career.  So bullying's good, kids.  Bullying is good.  I think bullying's good, yeah.  It gives people ambition.  Right.  To advance my career.  Yes.  How did you remember...  Because we interviewed Henry Winkler, and we got it out of him that he did play the Fonz.  We were a top-notch show.  How did you...  And he...  It's hard to get him on that track.  He just won't ever...  He never admits it. 
[02:28:30]  But we got the thumbs up.  It was an amazing moment for us.  But you...  He said for dialogue that he would just get the gist of it, because he had the problem memorizing  dialogue because of dyslexia.  So what did you do when you had to go after...  How would you memorize dialogue?  He used to go, yeah!  It's a note box.  Start with the original line, and he went, hey.  And they're like, all right, we'll go ahead.  Screw it, right?  Yeah.  Because Zanf was his original name.  So hard to get him to talk about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Get him out of his shell.  I'm sorry.  I forgot the question. 
[02:29:00]  How would you memorize dialogue, or what would you do if you...  Would you just read it and slowly, or what would your thing be to memorize?  Well, I have a photographic...  What the...  Camera?  So, you know, it wasn't that difficult, actually.  I heard Gleason had that.  You could actually look at a script once or twice in your pretty off book with it?  Who?  Gleason.  He gets you out.  He keeps nailing Jimmy with these things.  Who?  Say what? 
[02:29:30]  I love it.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I forgot the question.  And you.  I'm very forgettable.  I really am.  I just fade like invisible ink as you look at me.  No, what was the...  I forgot it, too.  It was a good time.  Oh, do you really have a photographic memory?  No.  No.  It was kind of a joke.  Oh, I didn't.  You're very deadpan.  You're pretty sharp, I'll tell you. 
[02:30:00]  Did you really want to be a jockey?  Yes, I did.  See?  I never know when you're kidding.  You brought this on yourself.  But at this weight, even the horses ask you to get off.  Did I say the horse?  You certainly did, but it's all right.  Not quite like that.  It was delivered differently.  You did, you know.  Yes, I did.  And I only weighed 105 pounds, so that was no problem at the time.  And my dad was training horses while he was cleaning up crap.  That's all. 
[02:30:30]  So, yes, that was my goal in life.  Wow.  But falling off as much as I did, people get annoyed when they bet on your horse and you come across the finish line and you're not on the horse.  The sucky falls off the horse, yeah.  That's pretty much your bet's done at that point.  You lose.  So, when you would, did you, and I know this is such a dumb question, but the greatest fear is you're going to forget a line.  And going out on live television, it's very frightening that you're going to forget something and blow the scene for everybody, right? 
[02:31:00]  Yes, it is.  Good.  No, no.  We'll be right back after this, ladies and gentlemen.  Tim Conway is breaking down and crying.  I'm a deep question.  No, is this your first day?  It isn't your first day, is it?  No.  It is, actually.  Yes.  I won a contest.  They said interview somebody you know nothing about.  Well, you're doing very well.  You really are.  Yes.  He's doing amazing.  What a good job. 
[02:31:30]  I wouldn't worry about it.  And it was an ensemble cast, of course.  Was there any, because you hear about, like, SNL and the people are very competitive there and stuff.  Was there any competition between you guys on Carol Burnett as far as who got to go out?  We're going to ignore you now.  I don't blame you.  I mean, after that crack question, you're an ensemble cast.  How come you don't jump all over him for his awful observations?  Wow, you noticed that Carol and Harvey were there with Tim?  Don't blow my candle out to try to make you a glider. 
[02:32:00]  What a glider.  I don't have one lift.  A pile of wax.  Again, I forgot the question.  Oh, jeez.  Here's the answer.  Yeah.  No, there wasn't.  No.  No competition.  No competition.  Just love.  I was a much better performer than her.  Well, of course.  Of course.  No question about that.  Yeah, Harvey, of course.  Did they all start at the same time?  Because I guess they brought Vicki Lawrence on a little later. 
[02:32:30]  Vicki was on the original foursome, whatever it was.  Oh, well then, screw me running.  Yeah.  Again, another...  Yeah, you really don't know the time frame.  You don't have any of the facts, Greg.  Well, that's why I'm going to read Tim Conway's What's So Funny.  It's all in here.  Which is the book.  It's right here in this very book.  What's So Funny by Tim Conway.  Put that thing away.  And this...  What is this?  What is this?  Is this your entire career? 
[02:33:00]  Because it's a little thin.  I don't know.  I haven't read it.  Actually.  I haven't read it.  But I'm looking forward to it.  Tim is doing some signings.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't even know about this.  What is that?  Oh, you just go down and sign?  Yeah, you just sign some books for some people.  And tomorrow, October the 29th, the book review in Huntington, Rhode Island.  Oh, that's a great independent bookstore. 
[02:33:30]  That's a big one.  You finally made it, Tim.  November 8th is Vromans Bookstore.  If you're not doing anything, you want to come down?  I'm busy.  Banter.  That'd be nice.  No, I am actually doing nothing.  Really?  I'd be happy to go.  I can understand that.  I'd be happy to go to your book signings.  That'd be cool.  Is this your first day here?  It certainly is.  Tim's just hurting everybody's feelings.  He makes people laugh on television and then just insults people and makes them feel bad 
[02:34:00]  about themselves in real life.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It's all right.  There you go.  Oh, Jimmy, you okay?  You okay?  Yeah.  I can't believe you're 79.  You're going to be 80 this year, Tim.  I'm 80 this year.  Wow.  December.  Follows 79.  Yeah.  Well, he's still sharp, too.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, that's an illustrious career. 
[02:34:30]  Got it.  Of course.  It's an important thing.  What are you working on these days?  Nothing.  Aside from nothing.  No, it's over for me.  No.  As a matter of fact, this is my last show.  Sorry to hear that.  I wanted to close with this.  Yeah, with this.  With this.  This and that whole career just culminates on this very program.  Hold on.  Good question coming up.  Oh.  Here we go.  Look at this.  All right.  Look at this.  He came around.  I was a fan of Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins. 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  And the amazing thing about Mr. Tudball was how slowly you did everything.  And were you.  Is it frightening to go so slowly and not rush the laugh or rush the moment?  I guess the good question is after this one.  Yes.  This was one to get him going.  That was a shit question.  And then the follow-up one is a zinger.  Please.  Don't tell him my method.  It's an amazing method.  Okay.  That's, again, I forgot the question, but yes. 
[02:35:30]  I finally understand what Jimmy was saying, though.  You want to kind of, the comic timing of the whole thing, you kind of, it would make you a little nervous to have to do things so slowly and pull the audience along with you like that until it gets fun.  To allow that to breathe.  I can argue.  Right.  Right.  Again, explaining comedy to the great Tim Conway.  Well, I'm more asking, because that's a very frightening thing to allow, because I tend to just rush. 
[02:36:00]  Well, like when you get a script like that, I mean, does it say that you're going to be moving slowly?  Or do you look at the script?  Who is this?  I'm a mystery person on the right.  Who is this?  I'm going to participate.  I'm going to be in on this.  No one wants to talk in this room right now.  Half an hour.  Do you read the script and then decide that you're going to, hey, I'm going to do this guy really slowly, or was this suggested to you?  I don't see this going well.  No, no, no, Tim. 
[02:36:30]  I take some of the heat off, Jim.  Thanks for just listening.  So, Jim, what do you think?  Brian dove on the grenade there and just blew his guts out.  That was actually my good question, so I'm happy you threw it out there.  Oh, boy.  Hey, during McHale's Navy, were you able to actually go out on a battleship or destroyer like that?  Actually, it was cardboard.  It was cardboard. 
[02:37:00]  I remember the cardboard.  It was on a railroad track underneath.  It was.  So, yeah.  So, move that way.  You're really good.  Oh, so when it pulled away from the dock, it was just going on a little railroad track.  Just going out into the middle of the lake.  But just because you were on the show, like you never got to, you know, like when Tom Cruise did Top Gun, they took him up in the plane to show him what it was like.  Well, that was Tom Cruise.  They never took you out on a battleship or a...  No.  No?  No, I never had anything to do with it.  I was in the Army for much too long.  Was it during the big one? 
[02:37:30]  Big what?  A hernia.  Anything like that was during the...  Yeah.  You gave everybody a trust and you marched down Main Street on Memorial Day.  So, I guess it was a little after WW2?  Oh, yes.  So, you lucked out.  I waited for that to cool down.  You mean, yes.  You know what?  That could have been...  What an understatement.  To cool down.  You know.  That global conflict.  To cool down.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  That's an understatement.  Oh, so you were between wars.  Yes.  That's nice.  Very much so.  And you?  I just wanted to just listen.  That's good.  He jumps in once in a while.  You do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've never been in the military.  That's good for radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We allow everything to breathe a little bit.  We like silence on the radio.  Wow.  So, okay.  You're in the military.  What?  Some kind of motor pool guy?  I picture you in the motor pool. 
[02:38:30]  I was in special services, actually.  Oh, that sounds very secretive.  Yeah.  What is special services?  I don't know.  I had the combination to a safe.  And I would open it in the morning and shut it at night.  And I was in charge of that safe.  Probably big secrets about the Cold War.  Oh, yes.  Well, we had the...  We assigned people in Seattle to overseas, to Japan.  There was no conflicts or anything.  So, well, because the Japanese were hokey. 
[02:39:00]  Imagine some guy watching television.  He sees you on the Calabernet show and goes,  That's what I'm always afraid of.  That guy had access to the nuclear codes and didn't even know it.  I had access to the entire strength in the South Pacific.  Of the South Pacific, really?  And I used to leave the safe open at night sometimes.  And I would go home sweating.  Why not?  Yeah.  What's the matter?  You knew McHale?  That worked out.  We weren't attacked.  Yeah.  I met you years... 
[02:39:30]  I don't know why I'm doing this, but I'm going to try it again.  Jimmy!  I met you...  You want to get close.  I just really do.  I just want to be frank with Tim Conway.  That's not happening.  Yeah, well, that isn't happening.  I met you and Harvey Korman together.  Wow.  You were doing Vegas.  I was on The Late Show with Dice.  Oh, yeah.  You were on The Early Show.  Funny guy, yeah.  Yeah, me and Florentine were on The Late Show.  So, I'm saying Florentine, I'm just throwing him into this.  And we didn't get to see you and Harvey because the tickets were sold out and we couldn't get tickets. 
[02:40:00]  And they wouldn't comp us.  We could see your show anytime.  There's plenty of seats.  You could have laid down in the front row in a sleeping bag and just enjoyed it.  Oh, my God.  Tim Conway is a mean little bastard.  Oh, my God.  No, I do remember those days.  Yeah, it was only about 10 years ago.  What were you doing? 
[02:40:30]  Were you doing stand-up or were you just doing sketches?  I don't think it's any of your business.  What were we doing?  Yeah, stand-up.  Well, sit-down wasn't in vogue then.  So, you don't mind if I blow my nose?  I'd prefer it.  No, please.  It's one time you're not being mean.  Until he wipes it on you.  Can you hold it?  Throw some flu at you.  You dropped some dollar bills. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, that was just a napkin.  Jimmy.  All right.  Let's see.  What were all these names you have there?  These are all...  This is your IMDb.  IMDb?  Yes.  What would that be?  Yeah, yeah.  Internet Movie Database.  Oh, my God.  That's the history of everything you possibly could have done on television and movies.  That's pretty impressive.  And you memorized this, obviously, because you want to talk about a lot of these shows.  I did, actually.  There must be 50 or 60 things there.  There's a lot more than that if you go back to the other page. 
[02:41:30]  You did a lot.  You were in Speed 2.  I'd like you to talk about that.  Okay.  Well, did you see Speed 1?  I did.  Yes, yes, of course.  Well, it was pretty much the same thing.  They just played it again.  Yeah.  But in the water.  Yeah.  It was the big boat, of course.  Yes.  Of course.  There were a lot of shows back in the 50s and 60s that featured comedians.  There were a lot of shows.  There were a lot.  They started them.  I think everything on television was a show, pretty much. 
[02:42:00]  And they featured a lot of comedians.  You know, if you look at Dick Van Dyke and, of course, what do we have?  Your show of shows?  Things like such.  You started it.  I know.  I did start that.  I dropped off.  I'm just wondering, you don't see much of that anymore.  No, you don't.  You see, like, the single comedy.  You don't really see a bunch of...  It's hard to explain.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very hard to explain.  Yeah.  Which I just presented.  The exact thing of how difficult that actually is to grasp and put into question form. 
[02:42:30]  Which, of course, again, didn't even come to fruition.  Never came out as a question, Tim.  Let us pray.  Tim is impossible.  Tim's book, My Life as a Horrible Person, is now on...  And there are book signings tomorrow, if you want to meet Tim Conway in Huntington, New York. 
[02:43:00]  Who would want to meet Tim Conway?  That's exactly my point.  If you want to subject yourself to this...  Have fun.  Oh, my God.  Like, October 29th tomorrow in Huntington, New York.  He'll be signing on November 8th at Roman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, and November  the 13th at the Barnes & Noble in L.A.  Will you meet the one in California?  I'll be at all three of them.  Yeah.  All three of them just snapping photos and just watching people try to be friendly to you  and seeing them walk away tear-stricken. 
[02:43:30]  Well, I've never enjoyed a show as much as I had this one.  Oh, look at that.  That is great.  Thank you.  Definitely.  I was worried this was going to be a fluff interview.  Oh, no.  No, not at all.  Tim, to put a stop to that.  Exactly.  I know.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  Post-traumatic stress from an interview.  Really removes all those silly illusions.  Remember those things we used to say? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, Carol Burnett, that must have been a fun show to work on.  No, sir.  You can bet that wasn't the truth.  Tim Conway, thanks so much for coming in.  This has just been a pleasure.  Tim's book is called What's So Funny and a Comedy Legend.  I sent a wrap-up here.  Oh, you were wrapping up because you just said...  No, no, no.  I'm not going anywhere.  Oh, okay.  I wouldn't have ripped this off if I knew.  I was just doing that to be theatrical.  The interview was going to end with an end stay-out.  Oh, you're on TV, too. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  That's great.  Now, we're trying to get somebody a little friendlier coming up next.  So, Jake LaMotta.  Right after that.  Well, we do have to take a break, so...  Yeah, so we have...  And you should.  Yes, we should.  Nick Offerman is...  Permanent.  ...coming in.  Do you remember this picture, Tim?  I took a picture.  I want to see if you remember this photo.  Yes.  He hasn't shown it to him yet.  Yes.  It was a photo of myself and you.  And do you remember, I said to you, I walked up, and it was Carol, Vicki, and you, and I  said, I love your show.  And you said, thanks.  Oh, wow. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Last nice picture, man.  That's me.  You're kidding.  I'm much better than that.  I can see that.  What are you...  Have you been sick or what?  Oh, that's Vicki.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course, he's going to want you to sign that.  That can't be you.  It is me.  Did you go on a diet or something?  I did.  I've been just doing a lot of working out and stuff.  Eating better.  Eating better.  That's fantastic.  That's great.  That's great.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Okay, do you have any other... 
[02:45:30]  You look a little thinner yourself, I'll be honest with you.  Have you a nice moment?  I'm going to share a nice moment with Tim Conway.  That's how this goes.  Good luck with that.  It's going to get ugly very fast.  Well, I, unlike you, have about a week left, so...  Oh, Tim.  Oh, God forbid.  That's more than we were hoping for.  That's all right.  Let's say thanks to Tim Conway, everyone.  The great Tim Conway.  Nick Offerman from Parks and Rec, next.  After these messages, the O.P. & Anthony Show will be right back. 
[02:46:00]  And now, back to the O.P. & Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Holy shit.  That was amazing.  Sweating.  After that.  We were talking about it the whole break with everybody, and...  Tim Conway was amazing.  That was so much fun. 
[02:46:30]  Just...  He was hilarious that the way he was undermining everything we were trying to do.  I just started looking down and praying that he didn't notice me.  Don't call on me.  Don't call on me.  I felt like I was back at school.  That's what it felt like.  At one point, I just started looking down.  I'm like, I don't want any part of this.  Oh, really?  Don't call on me.  Don't call on me.  In a good way.  I was like, oh, God.  And then you get halfway through, like, your question or whatever it is, and then in your  head you realize, oh, no, I'm not doing this. 
[02:47:00]  I'm failing miserably.  Oh, that was unbelievable.  That was very funny.  It was very funny.  He's almost 80 years...  He'll be 80 in December.  And he's just knocking...  Sharp as all hell.  But he knows the whole dynamic when an older gentleman comes in.  Like, Jimmy mentions Gleason, and he goes, who?  Right.  And your natural response is to be sympathetic and be, oh, Jackie Gleason, and then you realize,  oh, he's fucking with me.  Yes.  Of course he knows Jackie Gleason.  That was good. 
[02:47:30]  He was very enjoyable.  Oh, I love the abuse.  That was a lot of fun.  Brian said after the one question, he goes, okay, I know.  Now I'm just not going to say anything.  Yeah, I think that really shook Brian to his core.  Nick Offerman's walking down the hall.  Very busy with guests today.  Trying so hard to say something that he was going to...  Holy shit.  And then we were talking about how he was just throwing up brick walls.  It's like, what?  At every turn.  He's like, yeah, boom, brick wall.  And then you turn to try to get around it. 
[02:48:00]  Boom, another wall.  Which makes a great radio, but you really do want to have an interview with that guy  because he's seen everything.  You have.  Like, where he came from and how...  Was he even a jockey?  Yeah, that I think he was telling the truth about.  But we're not sure.  Not absolutely sure.  I'm not absolutely sure he was actually a jockey.  He's probably somewhere right now laughing.  Oh, they bought the jockey thing just because I'm a short guy.  A short fella.  I don't know if that was true.  I have no idea.  Great Nick, Andy.  You're fired.  Nick Offerman from Hawks and Rec. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, I recognize him.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Good morning, Nick.  How you doing, man?  Take a seat.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  We do the immediately on the air thing.  Yeah.  So we're actually on the air.  We just got...  Don't worry about it.  I don't want you to, like, rush or anything.  We just got beat up by Tim Conway.  That's what I heard.  Tim Conway.  I mean, he just destroyed the entire room.  He's not a nice guy.  No.  He's a mean little prick.  Right.  He just gave me a rather baleful look in the men's room. 
[02:49:00]  Did he?  Yeah.  He'll do that.  I gave him a dollar.  He was a mean little bastard he was.  Wow.  Kind of enjoyable, but it was kind of like, you know, expecting Tim Conway from the Cal Burnett  show and fucking Amon Gert to show up.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  That was rough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I'm sure his book is really good, so...  We're not talking about his book anymore.  So we're talking about...  There's not even a picture in his book.  No.  It's about his life, and there's not one picture.  Nick Offman has a book.  A very funny guy. 
[02:49:30]  Paddle Your Own Canoe.  It's one man's fundamentals for delicious living.  And what exactly is...  Because we just got the book.  What exactly is the push-up?  Is it your life story, or is it...  Well, I've been touring a show as a humorist that details my 10 tips for prosperity.  There are a number of things I want to say to the young people of our nation who I find  to be insufferable often.  Sometimes.  And just things like, say please and thank you.  Put down your phone.  Carry a handkerchief. 
[02:50:00]  Use intoxicants for crying out loud.  And some friends of mine began to say, you know, I like your point of view in your show.  It sounds like it's coming from your book.  And I said, oh, you know, there's a whole bunch of stuff I didn't have time for in my stage show.  So I pitched around a book.  And so it's, you know, it's entertaining.  It's funny.  It's a bunch of stories from my life about what a jackass I am and how I've managed to do okay despite that.  So, you know, there's some allusions to Parks and Rec and my character. 
[02:50:30]  Or there's a chapter on eating red meat or how to grow manly whiskers, things like that.  Are you a Second City guy?  No, I come from straight theater.  There's no such thing.  Quote, unquote.  Quote, unquote.  Forgive me, legit theater.  All right, that's different, sir.  Straight theater with two guys somewhere in the Midwest.  There were seven of us. 
[02:51:00]  But I knew them.  Like, I knew Amy Poehler in the early 90s in Chicago.  But I was at, like, Steppenwolf.  And I had my own theater company called the Defiant Theater.  And we were doing, you know, Sam Shepard plays and Shakespeare.  We'd do a Shakespeare play.  But we'd do Hamlet.  But Claudius would be like a cocaine king.  And it would be full of, like, iced tea and NWA songs.  So I come from theater.  And then only in my 30s did I start working at the Upright Citizens Brigade. 
[02:51:30]  Because I realized nobody, if you come from, quote, unquote, straight theater, people think you should be in drama.  And they don't think you're funny because you didn't go to comedy school.  And so I said, well, I better go over to the comedy school and start smoking on the playground with those kids.  Sam Shepard was his, I just, by the way,  I fucking went to open up a pen and click.  The wrong way.  And I clicked the point.  I feel like I've been shot.  I hate that. 
[02:52:00]  The, uh, Sam Shepard, did he do a play  where he plays, where the woman's name is May?  Oh, fuck.  Something about May.  Yeah.  There was a May.  There was a woman named May.  I'm only thinking because I...  Something about May.  Yeah, he masturbated onto his face.  Oh, yes.  Onto every month but that one.  No, it was, uh, I think it was the worst thing I ever did was a scene in acting classroom.  I think it was a Sam Shepard play.  Yeah.  Oh, it was an...  Why did they pick that one?  I don't know.  It was just me.  I was terrible. 
[02:52:30]  What are the names of some of his plays?  Oh, Buried Child, Fool for Love.  It was Fool for Love.  Michelle Pfeiffer did the movie, right?  That sounds right.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, I did a scene out of Fool for Love.  It was brutal.  The only thing I know about Sam Shepard is he was in The Right Stuff.  He certainly was.  He's a great actor.  He was a great actor in that.  That was great.  He was the Chuck Yeager character.  He was.  Yeah, he's in a great movie coming out.  A buddy of mine wrote August Osage County.  He plays a great role in that. 
[02:53:00]  It was a Pulitzer Prize winning play a few years ago here in town.  He's what you call stoic.  Yes.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  With a granite visage.  Yes, yes.  Okay.  All right.  I got some words to look up when I get home.  You see?  I'll take it.  Old Saddle Face.  Old Saddle Face.  Which is something I aspire to.  I hope to be around that long.  I got to ask you about Parks and Rec. 
[02:53:30]  It's on hiatus.  What's that about?  Well, that's a bit of an embellishment by the muckrakers over at the Huffington Post.  Oh, boy.  NBC is trying to figure out who to put in the game and strategize how to get ahead here  one of these days.  And so they put us on the bench for like two weeks.  Oh, okay.  It's something that they do all the time where they're like, you know what?  Let's try and up this show's numbers by putting the voice in front of it. 
[02:54:00]  Right, right.  And so we just sat down for a minute.  All right.  That's way different.  Not going anywhere.  It is, yeah.  I think we're going to get to finish the season.  Is that show completely scripted?  Jesus.  Or is it...  Because Amy's a brilliant improver.  I've seen her work and she's one of the greatest I've ever seen.  She's like a crazy comedy machine.  You put a quarter in her and she'll crank out a seven-part series.  It's like harassment.  It's unbelievable.  I have a quarter in her.  It's terrible. 
[02:54:30]  I kind of like this.  Right?  A 50-cent piece.  Excuse me.  Oh, right.  It is entirely scripted.  Our writers, a room of writers led by Mike Schur, who comes from SNL and then The Office.  They're brilliant.  So we never need to make up a thing.  But because we have people like Amy, we can shoot the incredible script and then say,  okay, now what do you got?  And then we'd screw around and find some other gold.  And how much of that stuff makes the show? 
[02:55:00]  Probably, I'd say, three or four moments a show.  You know?  Right.  You shoot a scene where it comes around to me and I have a punchline like, please don't  touch my axe.  And then I'll take five through seven.  I'll say, please don't touch my firewood implement or whatever the BS is.  And once in a while, it's funny.  With the others, quite frequently, it's funny.  And sometimes they keep it in the show.  Nice.  And what is your play about or your stage show? 
[02:55:30]  It's something I've often aspired to do is play the guitar and entertain people where  they let me finish.  And I never even remotely came close to it.  But then I realized if I can get them laughing, they don't care how terrible my guitar playing  is.  So it's a bunch of funny songs with all these anecdotes of, you know, here's a story about  me being a complete idiot when I was a teenager, interspersed, sort of dovetailed in with these 
[02:56:00]  lessons of, you know, say please and thank you.  Don't look in the mirror.  That's a big one.  Don't look in the mirror.  Avoid the mirror.  Yeah.  That's the key to a great self-image.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you'll kind of be down on yourself.  All of the channels, all the commercials keep telling me I should look like Keira Knightley.  And I feel good about that inside, and I mince about the sidewalk, feeling beautiful, and 
[02:56:30]  it works well unless I look in the mirror and see, oh, Jesus, this is not cutting it.  You're one of the few guys that really makes a mustache work in this day and age.  I mean, it really works for you.  I can't...  How long have you had the mustache?  Well, I'm a character actor, so it's one of the tools in my box.  I love to pull it out when I'm playing a cop or a thug or whatnot.  I guess I've had a pretty full, you know, set of facial bracken since I was about 20 or 
[02:57:00]  19, but I don't, you know, I don't go for one look, so I'm looking forward when my show  is over to...  To shave it off.  ...put it away for a while.  Oh, okay.  I gotcha.  Do you get sick of it?  I don't mind it.  Usually, I've never been on a series like this before, so usually I look really different  every three months, and that's fun.  It's like a Lon Chaney lifestyle.  Who are you...  You know, I like to be unrecognizable.  I found a way to do that in 20 years of stand-up. 
[02:57:30]  But now it's...  I'm ready to have the disguise of my clean-shaven face.  What do you mean Lon Chaney?  Did he switch up the way his look all the time?  Yeah, well, he was the guy who played sort of every different monster, and he was an  early film makeup genius.  He used to...  When he had to make his eyes look blind, he would cut out that filament from a hard-boiled  egg between the egg and the shell. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, shit.  And lay a piece of that over his eye, which I've tried.  That's committing.  Wow.  It's quite difficult.  I would gather.  You actually tried that.  I did, because I was broke, and I said, oh, Lon Chaney did this, and I talked to a  guy whose dad did makeup with Lon Chaney years later, and he was like, oh, well, there's  a whole bunch of other shit you've got to do to it.  You can't just lay that.  You don't just stick it in your eye.  Yeah.  You're so good in vinegar, and you know, kind of fog it up, I guess, or something.  Un-goop it. 
[02:58:30]  But doesn't it come apart, or how do you take it out?  Like a lens is solid.  A contact lens is solid.  It's the, um, taking it out, I couldn't answer, because I never quite got it in, but it's  like a fabric.  It's like that filament-y skin that pulls out from the inside of the shell.  And he thought to put that on his eyes to look blind.  It's pretty smart.  Yeah.  It's amazing now that it's just so easy to do, that you just throw a contact lens in  you, and fucking, you're done.  Yeah.  Which is what I ended up having to do.  I was like, oh, that was a day of pain.  How much are those white contact lenses? 
[02:59:00]  Why'd you want to look blind?  It was for a film.  Uh, an independent film that didn't have any budget.  And I was like, oh, I'll take care of the blind guys.  Yeah, I got the blind stuff.  Don't worry about it.  I got it, guys.  I'm on it.  I got some eggs.  But you know he did a good job of looking blind in The Scent of a Woman.  Like, he, he, there was something about, it didn't look like, it just looked like he  was kind of not seeing anybody.  And I'm like, what a talent that is to...  You can pull that off when they're playing blind people.  But it sounds stupid and simple, but to be able to look at somebody but not see them 
[02:59:30]  and look like you're not seeing them is pretty fucking impressive.  Especially when you have to act with somebody.  Yeah.  That would be a little hard to do.  That's the thing is, uh, I, if you, in the case of Al Pacino, you can be good at acting.  Uh, I, unfortunately, had to try and stick an egg in my face to pull it off.  Yeah, it's a little, it's a little different.  Is it hard to go from, uh, because this format of Parks and Rec is, you know, again, it's  a, it's a different feel.  It's kind of, it feels like a documentary style comedy. 
[03:00:00]  And then to kind of go back to straight comedy after that, or what's more traditional, probably  isn't as fun.  Uh, it's just, it's different.  I mean, I, I come from the stage and my wife and I did a play this year, which we're actually  bringing to New York next year called Annapurna, which is, uh, it's really a lot of fun.  It's a, it's a comedy, but then it gets really dramatic.  It's a really great piece of writing and that's, that's our first love.  And I guess in the theater you do what's ever in the season.  So maybe you're doing like, uh, the death of a salesman and then you turn around and 
[03:00:30]  do some wacky, you can go do the book of Mormon or something.  And so it's kind of fun to switch up disciplines.  We do get spoiled on my show because of the documentary style and everything's handheld.  We don't have a lot of marks like you do in a film and you can basically be sloppier  and lazier.  And so then you go back and work on a film and they're like, uh, no, Nick, we need you  to please do the same thing every time.  And you're like, oh yeah, I forgot.  They let me do whatever I want over at our hilarious chuckle fest. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  That's, it's gotta be nice.  Just to fucking kind of be freeing.  Yeah.  Being on the mark sucks.  It is many scenes.  Like if we were shooting this right now, they'd be shooting through the windows.  So there'd be no cameras in here.  And so you, you become much more relaxed and natural.  And I never do this unless I'm the last dimension.  The worst though is when you think you're doing it right and they're like, all right,  we gotta stop because you're in the wrong place.  Oh no.  What do you think?  Like, oh man, I'm brilliant here.  This is great. 
[03:01:30]  One of my best performances.  Yeah.  That ain't going to work.  You're like, oh, I have no sense.  I have no sense of what works or doesn't work.  Do you get scared when you act at all?  I get nervous.  I don't.  I, I, I, my first gig was as an altar boy at the Catholic church in my hometown, which  I believe is on page 29.  Uh, and, um, that was when I learned, uh, I started, you have, uh, these glass containers  called cruets.  One has water and one has wine and the priest mixes them, uh, as part of the ceremony and 
[03:02:00]  he somehow magically turns it into the blood of Jesus.  And then he drinks it.  Um, and invariably I, I served under several priests and they all really humorously.  It's like a Mel Brooks scene.  The take the wine and then go glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.  There you go.  And then take the water and go bloop.  All right.  That's an equal mixture.  That's all you need.  And I started, uh, I started reviewing the wine with facial expressions for the, for the 
[03:02:30]  crowd, you know, so I'd be standing there and I'd take a whiff of the wine and kind  of shake my head and make a frowny face.  Or sometimes I'd, I'd say, huh, pleasing, pleasing bouquet tinged with just a hint of  regret.  And, uh, my dad took me aside and was like, this is not the place to entertain the audience.  This is the congregation.  But I said, oh, okay, then I guess I need to find a place where people enjoy my mug, my 
[03:03:00]  mugging more than church.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No issues at church.  Yeah, I know.  You automatically think it's no, it's true.  I, uh, no, I, I escaped unscathed.  We had, we had a good, a good bunch of guys, but it was always really scary to, to hear  all the stories.  Oof.  You know, I can't.  I never hear any stories from anybody in real life.  So I'm assuming a lot of people are lying.  That's what I assume.  It's like, anything happen to you?  No, no, no.  We had a great, I mean, like, as he's saying that in his head is just this horror movie is 
[03:03:30]  playing House of Hearts.  Yeah, it's like House of Hearts.  Can't go back to the House of Hearts thing.  He's playing in his mind.  I'm perfectly well adjusted.  I love my Cub Scouts.  Are you, are you willing to take a lie?  Yeah.  I didn't take your test there.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, nothing happened.  The fact that I wake up screaming every night, there's nothing to do with that.  A lot of people get night terrors.  A lot of people finger their dogs.  Yeah.  Leave me alone.  It could happen. 
[03:04:00]  You a married man, are you?  I am.  I'm happily married.  I've been with my wife for 14 years.  The great Megan Mullally.  Did you say wife of 14 years?  Yes, we've been together for 14.  We just had our 10th anniversary.  Oh, dating for four.  Yeah.  I was making an underage girl joke.  My wife of 14 years.  This didn't really go over.  She's terrific.  Yeah.  You put a quarter in her.  That quarter is very Andy with women. 
[03:04:30]  And she's in theater with you?  Great.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's done Broadway shows.  She was in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, which is one of the greatest things I've ever  seen.  Who was she in that?  The Madeline Kahn part.  Elizabeth.  The Madeline Kahn part.  I thought he meant in the movie.  Yeah.  No, no, the musical.  They did a Broadway musical, yeah.  I was going to go like, wow.  I was going to get older.  We're married to Madeline Kahn.  What happened?  Yeah.  Didn't work out. 
[03:05:00]  And she does a little Parks and Rec, a little bit.  She does, yeah.  She works on my show.  She does.  As your ex.  She does all kinds of stuff.  She has an amazing new band called Nancy and Beth.  We were just analyzing it last night because it's, they do old-fashioned, like, kick-ass  blues and rock songs that are a little more obscure, but they add the production value of, like,  a Beyoncé show.  So she and her friend Stephanie Hunt, they do all this super sexy, intense choreography. 
[03:05:30]  It's like an old Tina Turner kind of show.  And it's just something nobody does anymore.  Like, we've all become so lazy that we sit on a stool and play a mandolin.  And they're like, let me sing to you about coffee.  Appreciate me.  But, yeah, they're called Nancy and Beth.  They're super, a lot of fun.  And I guest for them a lot.  I perform a couple different rap songs for them.  Really?  We do Hits from the Bong and Smell Yo Dick by Risqué.  Uh-huh.  So there's some mirth.  Is that a real song?  There's some mirth in the show. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, that's a real song?  It is.  Smell Yo Dick.  I think it's incredible.  You haven't played it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before, sure.  Yeah, Sam's played it.  What did you think of the passing of Lou Reed?  Everyone's talking about Lou Reed today.  Well, I doffed my cap.  I mean, I'm also a really big fan of a very close friend of his, Laurie Anderson.  You're a big fan?  Oh, God, yeah.  Hold on, okay.  She was a weirdo.  Hold on, though.  It's a weirdo, yeah.  We started our show because they married in 2008.  I did not know that.  And then we played O Superman because that's the only thing we know. 
[03:06:30]  Now, why are you a big fan?  We don't get it.  She's a performance artist, obviously.  She is, yeah.  But explain Laurie Anderson to us.  Well, she, to me, I mean, she's off the charts smart.  And so I feel daunted trying to, like, explain Stephen Hawking to me.  Ah, yeah.  But she...  What makes her so brilliant?  Well, you put a quarter in her.  She is a storyteller who takes her stories and performs them in a really innovative way. 
[03:07:00]  She also plays the violin.  So I used to see her live in the 80s and 90s.  And she just puts on really trippy, cool shows using sound and visual.  And so they're like these little theater pieces, just rife with great ideas.  So she's a progressive thinker.  You know, she does an amazing job of making fun of society.  I mean, in O Superman, there's that bit about, hello, this is your mom. 
[03:07:30]  And she takes sort of hilarious human dogma and points it back up to us to make us laugh at ourselves.  But her shows were the greatest.  I mean, if you like Pink Floyd the Wall or any kind of, like, intense visual kick-ass rock show,  it was sort of like that at a library.  I'm a huge fan of hers.  And that made me...  I love Lou Reed as well.  And then when they hooked up, I was like, fantastic. 
[03:08:00]  Wow.  There you go.  Please run our country.  We got our answer finally.  That's how we started the show.  I don't know.  I'm still too shallow to appreciate it.  Yeah, it's not for everyone, I'm sure.  You know what sounds good to me?  Swedish supergroup ABBA.  They also have their place in the Pantheon.  Exactly.  She's also really funny.  And maybe, I don't know.  Didn't come across in that Superman video.  Well, the Superman thing is weird because when 9-11 happened, that song resurfaced because it had all of these prescient lines of, 
[03:08:30]  here come the planes, the American planes.  Oh, so you got some conspiracy theorists going, look at this.  I think that the Bush administration may have been Laurie Anderson fans as well.  Oh, so they listened to it and then perpetrated that.  Or at least the Velvet Underground.  So Jesse Ventura could then explain it to everybody.  All right.  Apparently, W loved to crank up Sweet Jane when he was gone on a night mission. 
[03:09:00]  When he was partying.  Over Tuscaloosa.  You got a very unique voice, man.  I was just...  I'm hearing Christian Bale from American Psycho.  Really?  And then to go really obscure, Dave Rabbit, the Vietnam job.  Look what I wrote down.  Whoa.  What?  I wrote down Dave Rabbit.  Dave Rabbit?  I was going to point out that Nick sounded like him and I didn't want to forget.  Dave Rabbit.  Exactly.  There's some Vietnam tapes of this guy that used to just, you know, be a DJ over there 
[03:09:30]  during the shit.  And I don't know.  They became quite popular on our show.  You sound exactly like him.  And a little Christian Bale, no?  From American Psycho?  Or is that a stretch?  No, I wasn't really picking that up.  I've actually heard that a lot, which is...  American Psycho?  It is.  All right, thank you.  It's a very funny...  And I don't...  It's such a funny thing.  You sound exactly like American Psycho.  Yeah, you know what?  That's not...  You're right.  You sound like a rapist.  Yeah.  That's...  I hear also, and I'm not super familiar with, I guess, their normal speaking voices, but 
[03:10:00]  drivers often say, when they don't see me, they say, if I didn't know it was you, I  would swear I had Charlie Sheen in the back of my car.  Oh, yeah.  There is a Charlie Sheen thing.  And also, sometimes, Nicolas Cage.  Yes, I hear a little Nicolas Cage.  Jimmy would know.  Jimmy sat down on a flight with Nicolas Cage and had a little conversation with him.  Let's hear about that.  Well, could you once in a six-hour period go, huh? 
[03:10:30]  That's all I need from you.  He wasn't very talkative with Jimmy, and Jimmy wanted to be talkative with him, and it was  embarrassing.  Oh, you want to hear Dave Rabbit, who we really think you sound like?  Sure, please.  All right.  Sorry about that yelling and screaming, but Pete and I are on a trip, and we thought we'd  have to get in on that song.  Wow.  He's got a glottal fry going on.  Yeah.  Three-dog night is called Mama Told Me Not to Come. 
[03:11:00]  Now, you can take these two ways.  As a title, or your girlfriend's name is Mama.  I like it.  He passed recently.  Yeah, he just died.  Those were all like...  Just amazing.  What, he hijacked the signal and fucking broadcast, right?  Oh, yeah, it was all illegal broadcast, and there's not much...  If anyone else has audio of that guy, I would love to hear it.  We only got, I don't know, one show or something of the guy. 
[03:11:30]  There's definitely something that...  He had a little more of that gritty, grainy, gravelly thing.  He had that good Vietnam shit.  Yeah, yeah, you know...  It does.  It sounds like he's talking while he's still holding in a hit.  That's some good fucking nom shit.  Well, that's what those guys would do, though.  They would do a hit and then just start talking without...  Well...  Exhale as they went, man.  That was back when...  During this radio interview, we would have tons of Marlboro Reds and joints in this room. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  And not to think twice about it.  Not even...  Now we only have three.  I love watching old movies like that, too.  I was watching something, an episode of Columbo or something.  I loved that dumb show.  And they had a scene inside an airplane, and there's just people smoking.  People just walking through the gates into the plane with not an ounce of security.  Oh, that's crazy.  You kind of remember that shit, though.  I love the notion...  The first major commercial flight I took, I went from my farm town in Illinois to the 
[03:12:30]  University of Illinois and ended up in this Kabuki theater play, which we were suddenly  going to take to Japan.  So that was my first big flight, was nonstop Chicago to Tokyo.  Okay.  And we were...  It was 1991.  We were like 21 years old.  And we got on this huge jumbo jet.  And just behind row 17 was the smoking section.  Yeah.  In hindsight, it's so idiotic.  Like, you're in a huge soup can, and they're like, everybody below one-third can smoke. 
[03:13:00]  Unless they've invented the force field, you are not going to be going to smoke.  Please don't smoke.  Like the dumb restaurants where there are non-smoking areas.  What the hell?  Did it stink the whole flight?  It was horrible.  Of course.  I never flew on a smoking flight.  Come on, Jimmy.  Never in my life.  I took one trip to Seattle in, like, 1990.  When did the smoking stop, though?  I don't know.  It was a continental flight.  It was an international flight.  That was an international flight.  It stopped later. 
[03:13:30]  Japan Airlines was one of the last.  If you took Japan Airlines, it was one of the last ones to stop it.  Oh, yeah.  They love smoking.  Japanese people, you sit at a blackjack table in Atlantic City.  You know, Japanese people, you can't even see the cards.  It's just like you're encased in smoke.  You know, Jimmy might be right.  I just assumed I was on a flight where they were smoking.  Never remember.  No, I don't think.  All right.  Sporting events, of course.  I remember that, though.  Holy shit.  And concerts.  My God.  I remember.  I was, like, 12 years old.  I'm on a plane going to L.A. and just smoke everywhere. 
[03:14:00]  It's how they allowed people to just have little flaming objects in the plane.  Yeah.  It just seems so odd now that for safety reasons.  In a vehicle that's carrying a huge amount of oxygen.  The oxygen and fuel.  And, yeah, yeah.  And there you go.  Everyone, have a lighter.  Light up.  And they're worried about our dumb cell phones.  Our cell phones.  Shut up.  Right.  Are you kidding me?  Please remove your shoes.  Right.  Yeah.  You used to turn your cell phones off.  What?  You know what we used to do up here?  We used to have fire in our seats. 
[03:14:30]  This was crazy.  Right.  We were pinching stewardesses' asses.  It's all nonsense.  Well, not at 12.  Oh, man.  Well, I say good luck with the book, Nick.  Have we sold it properly?  I don't even know.  It's called Paddle Your Own Canoe.  Yeah.  And it's Nick Offerman.  And it's got some true stories in there and some life advice.  And some humorous illustrations by a very funny guy named Mike Mitchell.  Including some illustrations of me performing breakdance moves.  Oh. 
[03:15:00]  Also, some acceptable and unacceptable versions of facial hair.  I'm right on that page.  Look at that.  Including, when I first met Harry Connick Jr., when he was working on Will & Grace, I had  a goatee.  Very funny, hilarious, talented guy.  And I met him.  You know, hi, this is Nick.  Hey, how you doing?  And he pulled me in with a handshake and said, where I come from, we call that a prison pussy.  And I said, I think you and I are going to get along. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, he is so funny.  Oh, the douchebag.  I think you got this doubt.  I'm looking at the illustration.  The douchebag.  Yeah.  The douchebag.  The nut smudge.  Yeah.  The joke.  I think you figured out the facial hair.  Are you doing your signings?  I am, yeah.  I've been doing, I had a big signing at Union Square at the Barnes & Noble.  And it's weird, it's a whole new medium, the book.  The book, turns out, yeah.  The stuff, they're putting it out on paper now, it's amazing. 
[03:16:00]  And it's rather permanent, like, it's funny, because you, you know, you tell jokes, you  tell stories, and there's something ephemeral to it, like, nowadays it exists forever on  the internet, but it's still, it's, you listen to it and it's gone.  But when it's written on paper in the library, people take it seriously in a different way.  Or maybe you get a different breed of nerd in the line, and I say nerd lovingly, counting  myself amongst their number, but they're, they're like, I've memorized your book, and 
[03:16:30]  there's a few things I wanted to talk to you about.  Oh, boy.  Out behind the building.  And you're like, well, hang on, I'll be right there.  Yeah, the creepy ones.  Always right before the bullet enters your side.  That's right.  Yeah, well, way to end it on a fun note.  No problem.  Nick signing is going to be like the fucking end of talk radio.  Enjoy my book.  You're a dead fucker.  Do you have any signings coming up?  So I was going to plug them, but we don't have them in front of us.  That's why we're saying it's Nick Offerman on Twitter. 
[03:17:00]  Nick underscore Offerman.  I do have, I have events coming up in Toronto and Vancouver, November 2nd and 3rd.  And I have my touring American ham show.  The only hard ticket show is at the Dallas House of Blues, November 16th or so.  The night before Meat Fight.  Meat Fight.  That's right.  My brother and I are judging an event in Dallas called Meat Fight, which raises money for multiple sclerosis.  It's hard to say. 
[03:17:30]  We just say MS.  MS.  Makes it easier.  And where can people go to get your signings?  Wait, we got to ask about Meat Fight.  What happens at that event?  Four barbecue pitmasters come together and gird their loins, literally.  They gird and smoke their loins and feed them to me.  And I reward one of them with a nod of approval.  See, I was assuming something violent.  Meat Fight.  See, I was assuming something really fun between two gentlemen.  We all came to different conclusions about it. 
[03:18:00]  I haven't gotten a lot of details, so it could be a penis-slapping facial situation.  All right.  That's fun, too.  Whatever it is, we'll be raising a good amount of money for MS reasons.  It's not gay if it's for charity.  Whatever it is.  Let's get the shirts made.  You can find out about anything you want with my book or my tour at my website, OffermanWoodShop.com. 
[03:18:30]  I built that canoe that's on the cover.  Is that true?  That's real, right?  Yeah.  The wood thing?  Yeah, I make furniture and boats and stuff.  Oh, you do?  Manly guy.  How much are you charged to do a...  I'm trying to get a fucking nice, a small little TV stand made, but it's extremely expensive  to get done.  It is.  Why do you have it made?  Because they don't have the size I need.  I need a very narrow one because of the way my living room is.  Custom made.  Custom made.  I needed custom.  Come on, Nick.  You could do it for them.  There's a guy in town, actually, my friend Jimmy DiResta. 
[03:19:00]  You probably know John DiResta.  I know John.  I was just talking about him.  He's a comedian.  He lives in L.A. now, yeah.  Really funny guy.  His brother, Jimmy, is on the Lower East Side, and he's an incredible fabricator of things.  And he makes furniture.  He can make you anything out of any material.  Do you have dado blades?  We have dado blades, yeah.  Yeah, you cut yourself a dovetail joint.  Yeah, that's right.  That's nice.  I like that.  That's a good shot.  It's a manly guy right there.  I like the way you talk.  I like that.  Do you sell the canoes? 
[03:19:30]  We've sold one canoe on commission.  I've made two, one for myself and one for JimmyDiResta.com.  And they're expensive.  Like, you can't make canoes for a profit.  They take months to make.  There's a lot of pieces, and there's no straight lines.  Other people can do that stuff and just say, look, I made this.  Well, we do.  No, we have a sweatshop.  I've got a shop full of woodworkers, but unfortunately, it's good-hearted, and we're trying to make these youngsters a living.  These are amazing, too, these canoes like this, because it literally looks like furniture. 
[03:20:00]  It's floating.  It's beautiful.  The sides are so nice and shiny.  At first, it gets really hard.  Like, you don't want to take it out.  You don't even want to take it out.  You're like, well, it's like putting a wonderful dresser in the water.  I should have built a Corvette.  Kicking a coffee table into the water.  Don't want to bang this up.  Yeah.  A lot of sanding.  A lot of wet sanding with that.  I eschew the wet sanding as much as possible.  Yeah?  It's a great finishing technique, but it's like a super high-end, refined museum quality. 
[03:20:30]  Yes.  And I try to have all the stuff I make be of a more rustic, natural.  It'll fit into a modern home, but it'll also fit into Paul Bunyan's lodge.  So what, do you just use a rasp?  I spit on it.  Finish it with a rasp.  I sand up to about 150, 180.  Ooh, yeah.  That's some fine grit.  220 is as high as I like to go.  A little high, as high as you go?  Yeah.  I hear you. 
[03:21:00]  I'm going to call Jimmy Duresta and say, Nick Offerman said you could hook me up with a nice little unit.  He said it wouldn't run me more than 600 bucks.  He'll say, hey, I'm from Long Island.  I'm sure he didn't give you a quote.  He isn't much faster than I am.  He's incredible.  He's somebody who's kind of a hero to me.  You can be like, hey, can you make me these headphones out of glass or steel or yarn?  He'd be like, oh, yeah, I'll give them to you next Wednesday. 
[03:21:30]  You know what?  Because the quotes I've gotten, it's a very specific thing.  It's not too complicated.  It's pretty simple what I want.  Yeah.  But it's just I need a certain size, and that's what's hard to find.  You've got to go custom.  And the quotes are astronomical, and it's just not worth it.  Wow.  It's a tough thing.  I mean, there's a resurgence of artisanal hand crafting in our country, which I'm a big fan of, because in our communities, if we can all begin making our own stuff again, you know, you make leather belts and boots.  I'll grow a garden. 
[03:22:00]  You knit dresses.  We'll work to do that.  I'll wear them in the garden.  I'll spank you in my belt.  We'll get together and have a meat fight.  That sounds great.  But it's a Jeffersonian thing.  If a community can support itself, then we can tell China to go suck it at some point.  That would be nice.  It would be nice.  That's all I'm saying.  We're being held as their little puppets these days.  They own a lot of our country.  Well, I know.  That's the catch.  It would be nice to have that not happening. 
[03:22:30]  That is the catch.  It's kind of tough to tell them to go fuck themselves.  Well, once we all start cobbling our own shoes, we'll get to that point.  You know what, Opie has a good point.  It literally is tough to tell them to go fuck themselves.  What is Chinese for go fuck yourself?  You've got to learn Mandarin first.  Yeah, you've got to learn Mandarin.  No?  I thought that was kind of funny, Jimmy.  I'm just weighing the options.  It's not a bad point, actually.  It's kind of hard.  All right.  Let's get Nick out of here.  Let's us get out of here. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, my God.  We're missing Sam's show.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we went late for Nick Offerman.  That means it went well.  Yes.  Yes.  And we're relieved that Tim Conway's gone.  Yes.  I was much more gentle.  Yes.  And we appreciate it.  Out of the two, I would assume you would be the meanie.  Not Tim Conway.  Tim's a rotten little man.  And Parks and Rec, of course, coming back.  That hiatus thing was just short-lived, a couple weeks.  Yeah, it's BS.  That's very good news.  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  And do we have anybody to...  Oh, Nick, I forgot to mention, that I'll be at the Beacon this Friday with Dice.  So go to Ticketmaster if you want to see me and Dice, and don't if you don't.  And who do we have tomorrow, anybody?  Who's coming in tomorrow?  You know?  We don't know until we get here.  I know.  I never know.  We'll figure it out tomorrow.  All right.  Nick Offerman, pleasure meeting you, sir.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Come back and see us, all right?  Yeah, great to meet you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  The O.P. and Anthony Live. 
[03:24:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Here we go.  After O.N.A. Live.  866-969-1969 is the phone number.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Everybody call in and have some fun on this Monday, huh?  Just because it's Monday doesn't mean we can't enjoy each other. 
[03:24:30]  Do you know what I mean?  Right?  DJ Who Kid has stopped by.  How are you, DJ?  Fuck Monday, God.  Why?  Why?  What do you got going on today?  That means I got a whole week of work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who the hell likes on Monday?  Nobody likes it.  I know.  Yeah, but you don't do any work.  Like, what do you mean?  What's a whole week of work to you?  I mean, you know, playing video games.  Right.  Exactly.  You know?  Exactly.  You don't exactly.  Baby mama.  You know what I'm saying?  What do we got?  What do we got here, Eric?  Two, uh, Murth? 
[03:25:00]  All right.  So we got a couple Nick Offerman books.  One signed, one not.  All right.  Yeah.  Nick Offerman said he would sign one book.  Yeah.  Oh, the Parks and Recreation guy.  Not two.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was just in here a minute ago.  He was a great guest.  Uh, he's got a book called Paddle Your Own Canoe.  You see, who kid?  You see this canoe?  On the cover of Nick Offerman's book?  Is that real?  Or is it real?  Not only is it real, he built it.  No way.  With his hands.  There are so many...  That's amazing.  ...weird similarities. 
[03:25:30]  He plays Ron Swanson on Parks and Rec.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a lot of weird similarities that go on between him and his character.  Do you watch Parks and Rec or no?  I saw a little bit.  Okay.  Eric, are you a Parks and Rec guy or no?  Yes.  Okay.  Tell me what your impressions of the Nick Offerman in-studio appearance were.  Because I want to see if anybody else fell along the same lines as me.  Um, you know, very low-key, very dry, and then also a lot of his punchlines in the show  are just stares.  Right.  So when certain people said something, he would just give you the look. 
[03:26:00]  If Travis is within earshot, I would like to hear, because Travis is a big Parks and  Recreations fan, because I want to see if anybody else had the same observation that  I did, because I was listening to him talk, you know, and he was great, and he was funny,  and he had the same...  He looks the same as he does on TV.  Yeah, he did.  And I just want him walk by.  The same cadence.  Like, he delivers his jokes in the exact same way.  He's kind of got this scowl.  I have another giveaway, too.  Oh, you have a signed book, too?  Yeah, he wrote Two Hobbits. 
[03:26:30]  Do you watch Parks and Rec?  Yeah.  What was your impression?  Did you hear the interview, or were you doing other stuff?  I heard a little bit of it.  Did you have any impression?  Like...  No, you don't...  Don't do an impression.  I mean, what...  It's like his character.  Right.  What did you...  Did you pick up on anything, Travis?  What's her question?  You...  Obviously, you watched Parks and Rec.  Yeah.  I just wanted to see what your takeaway from the Nick Offerman thing was.  Because I picked up on something that, like, blew my fucking mind.  That he's exactly like his character?  Not exactly.  Okay.  The difference is... 
[03:27:00]  Eric, you had your chance.  All right.  I didn't know...  You said to be like him, not the difference, but...  All right.  No, no, no, no, no.  I said, what was your impression of the thing?  You have a problem with listening, Eric.  That's your skill that you need to work on.  Right.  Remember this morning?  What was happening?  You kept ruining bits, right?  Did you?  Yes.  Did you not ruin two bits this morning?  Sure, I did.  Yeah.  I'll call Tim Conway on you.  Yeah.  Tim Conway.  And we'll get to Tim Conway in a minute.  But...  He looks the same.  He delivers his dialogue the same way he does on television. 
[03:27:30]  But have you ever heard him laugh before?  No.  It blew my fucking mind when he started...  Because he has a giggle.  Yeah.  That's just like jovial, lighthearted, like he does.  He's like...  How do you do it?  I'm Ron Swanson, and I like meat.  And it's just like, where did that come from?  Right.  He had this weird jovial giggle that would just pipe in.  And when I was sitting here, I was sitting behind him.  So, at first, I was like, is that Ron Swanson giggling like that?  He doesn't giggle.  I've never heard him laugh before.  How do you do it?  It was just like some weird, like... 
[03:28:00]  I don't know.  It was almost...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was almost like a cartoon.  It was cartoony and guttural and jovial.  Like Scooby-Doo-ish.  It was.  It was a little Scooby-Doo-ish.  And it was great.  But...  I mean, that to me blew my whole mind.  I was like, there's the person.  There's the human beings.  Because when these guys come in here, you go, oh, okay.  We're not getting the character.  We're getting the person.  For a second, it was like, no, no.  We have Ron Swanson in the studio.  He's almost exactly the same.  This is awesome. 
[03:28:30]  And then the giggle comes in and you go, what happened?  What happened to the guy from the TV that I was talking to a minute ago?  His mustache is crazy, though.  He does.  He's got an amazing mustache.  It's thick as hell.  How do you let it grow that long?  One of the interns is manipulating Travis's headphone wire as he's standing there.  Couldn't be more distracting, could it, Travis?  We're not doing a radio show.  It's okay.  What were you going to ask, Coot Kid?  How long does it take for your hair to grow that long in the stash here?  That mustache.  Yeah.  That takes a while. 
[03:29:00]  It takes a long time, man.  I would imagine.  That's why he can't shave it between seasons, I don't think.  No.  He's got to leave it the whole time the show's on, right?  I've seen him without it, but...  Does he look, like, completely different?  Completely different.  That's what I would figure.  I thought a bird stuck his head out there.  Yeah.  Well, it's a hell of a...  It was a hell of an interview.  I loved having him in, but that's what totally blew my mind.  But we have two books.  But this one here are two hobbits.  All right.  We have one signed book.  He signs all the books, like, just weirdly.  Because I've read that you could order, like, a signed copy, and everybody who got a signed 
[03:29:30]  copy, it was signed, like, to hobbits, to the wall, to shoes.  Yeah.  He's got that one signed, too, Hobbit, and this one is signed, too, Mirth.  There you go.  See?  Makes no sense.  We have a couple of Nick Offerman, Ron Swanson books.  You're excited to see them, huh?  I love them.  You love them.  I don't know why nobody watches that show.  It drives me crazy.  Nobody watches Parks and Rec.  But people figure, like, with the two weeks off, I'm like, okay, it makes sense.  But people are like, oh, it's going to be... 
[03:30:00]  Why does it make sense?  Because they do that to other shows, you give them a chance, like, pump the ratings.  Like, you rest one show, then it comes back, and it extends it a little bit longer.  I don't understand how taking a show off the air would help its ratings.  But that's also fairly new in the last couple years.  Yeah, they did before to, like, a lot of shows.  Yeah, I don't like it.  What you're supposed to do is you give shows a chance, and you let them do new episodes  until the new episodes are over, and then you stop new episodes.  It's just confusing.  We looked up on the DVR, like, over the weekend. 
[03:30:30]  Jess and me were scrolling through the DVR.  Oh, we have an episode of Parks and Rec.  And all of a sudden, we see CeeLo's face going, fuck you!  And not only is he telling me to go fuck myself, but I realize it's the voice.  Well, it's going to happen next week.  It's going to be Superm commercials.  Brand new, next week, Parks and Rec.  Yeah, I wanted it this week, not next week.  How about this week and next week we do new episodes of Parks and Rec?  Yeah, I'm about to have a battle round all over Blake Shelton's ass if he keeps interrupting my... 
[03:31:00]  He's getting irate.  Parks and Rec's.  That's irate.  That's right, hoot kid.  I-rate!  Calm down, Sam Conway.  You missed Tim Conway in here.  I know a couple weeks ago you were talking about wanting to meet Tim Conway.  Yeah, because I fucked with Carol Burnett when they came through here.  He would have tore your ass up.  What do you mean fucked with?  He was different than from there to here.  You hooked up with her?  She let me touch her lips, because, you know, they got the lip thing that they do.  On her face.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Who you thought I was touching? 
[03:31:30]  I don't know what you're talking about, hoot kid.  You always got crazy stories.  And the photo he took with him, hoot kid's, like, swinging a bat.  Yeah.  It's like, for your reason, we're like, where'd he get the bat from?  I thought it would be gangster, like me and Carl Burnett.  Did it look...  Iraq, you saw the photo?  I think it's...  Let me see if I have it on the line.  Did it look gangster?  Just tell me if it looked gangster.  No, because there's Carol Burnett's, you know, like, whole cast and crew, and hoot kid's got a baseball bat.  Yeah.  And he's, like, he's smiling.  Sorry, buddy.  You were incorrect about it then, I guess.  I think he was a little horrified, because he was there, too.  Tim Conway.  Mm-hmm.  Of course.  Chris in Virginia, welcome to the show. 
[03:32:00]  Hey, guys.  Thanks for clearing that last thing up.  For a second, I thought you had your old interns back in the studio giggling like little schoolgirls.  It was really awkward, but I had a question for you.  What was more awkward, the Tim Conway or Jenna Jameson?  I mean, it felt like Jim, you could feel him crawling in his skin, asking these questions that were getting no answer.  Tim Conway was just, I felt like, I mean, I didn't have to conduct the interview, so I don't know how it would feel in the seat,  but I would think that the Tim Conway interview was just fun, because you think this legend is coming in here, 
[03:32:30]  and you're like, you think it's going to go one way.  So you think you'll either have to walk him through some of the questions,  or he's been asked these same questions about the Carol Burnett show or whatever 150,000 times.  Or he might come funny.  Or he comes funny.  But you don't expect him to just be throwing shit at you every single statement, every question, every time you talk to him.  You don't expect him to take shit out from his pants and just throw it at your face and be like, 
[03:33:00]  what are you going to do now? I'm Tim Conway, bitch.  That's what he was doing, metaphorically speaking.  Did you guys find out if he was actually a jockey or not, or was that completely made up?  I don't know. I don't know. Tim Conway lives in the world of Tim Conway.  I don't know what's real and what's fiction anymore, and I'm not going to ask him.  I'm not going to set myself up.  How old is he, 80?  Yeah, he's 80 years old.  We were walking up the hallway, and the publicist goes, remember this?  He goes, I don't remember this fucking building.  He's just joking. She goes, oh, you did this big thing with Carol Burnett.  He goes, who's that?  And she kept on explaining to him, and he just kept on saying, I don't know what you're talking about. 
[03:33:30]  And you go, who are these people?  That's crazy.  And she goes, you did shows with them. He goes, what show did I do?  And you know Tim Conway was just doing it to amuse himself.  And he didn't give a shit.  Obviously, he knew.  Yes.  And the publicist just had to keep doing the publicist thing where she has to be nice.  Yeah.  And he goes, no, no, no, and explaining it to this old man.  And she goes, do you need to use the bathroom?  He goes, no, my bag's not filled yet.  He's like, all right. I like this guy. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, Chris, do you want Mirth or Hobbit?  I want whichever one is the stupidest looking.  Okay, we'll send you a book. Hold on.  You get Mirth, you stupid.  Why are you mad at him?  That monitor's not on, Eric.  Pick it.  Oh, my God, that is the photo.  Alex.  Got a bat.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  I just want to say, I was actually more surprised to hear him giggling like that in real life  because on the show, I thought that was just something he did for the show  because he has done that on Parks and Rec before. 
[03:34:30]  And then he comes on the show, and that's his actual giggle.  Yeah, I was more surprised at that.  Amazing.  All right, man. I'll talk to you later.  All right.  I'm looking at WhoKid's photo now.  Really, it doesn't make any sense.  So WhoKid took a photo with the cast of the Carol Burnett show when they were up here a few months?  ago, and I guess it's a bunch of people from Shade 45 in this photo,  and it looks like WhoKid just jumped into the photo holding a baseball bat.  Why were you doing that? 
[03:35:00]  I just felt like it was gangster.  But why?  There's no context, you're saying.  It gives us some nigger shit.  Oh, I understand.  It's just kind of over my head right now.  But the shit that's crazy is Tim Conaway is hugging a random black guy,  and he looks like he's like, why am I hugging this random black guy?  Or maybe he's like, who is this man who's here to attack me with a baseball bat?  Maybe there's a little bit of that, too.  So if you posted that photo on WorldStarHipHop, they'd be like, oh, yeah, that's some gangster shit.  He's just swinging a baseball bat around. 
[03:35:30]  You see that it doesn't make any sense now.  Yeah, you don't.  Whoever's screening calls line two is the one who won.  Jeez, everybody wants to win a book.  You should have sampled that laugh and just added to your show, maybe.  Snowy in Michigan.  Maybe we will.  We're going to do something with it.  What's up, Snowy?  How are you doing today, sir?  Pretty good.  How about you?  Yeah, I'm okay.  It wasn't for the fact that he met Tim Conaway not long ago.  I thought he was dead or something.  Did you know that Tim Conaway was alive?  Are you now any old people?  Ever since you found out about Johnny Carson, you're not taking anyone for granted. 
[03:36:00]  Honestly, I was shocked that all of them were alive at that town hall.  The whole cast.  I thought they were bringing their corpses up.  Right.  And then they were going to show their dead bodies.  Just a display piece.  They do that overseas.  Do you think...  Do they?  Do they?  To who?  When I went to Moscow, they had Stalin chilling.  He was there.  I mean, he's a dead corpse.  His body, I mean.  So I thought they would bring Carl Bernetta in that.  Did you know that, Roland, that in Moscow, Stalin's body is on display? 
[03:36:30]  I didn't know that part of Moscow existed.  Yeah, I've never heard of that.  Is it under the Kremlin?  I think I got it mixed up, but whatever.  I saw a dead body.  Kiki in Chicago.  Hey, what's up?  How's it going?  Good.  How are you?  Very well, thank you.  I have nothing funny to say.  This was like a book.  All right.  Well, if you want a book, you're going to have to answer some questions from DJ Who Kid.  DJ Who Kid, if you could...  All right.  If you could interview Kiki from Chicago. 
[03:37:00]  Okay.  How is your neck depth?  Great.  How about you?  No.  The neck depth, Kiki, though.  Do you have a number on neck depth?  Can you measure your neck?  No.  I have no number.  Okay.  I haven't done that in about six years.  Okay.  Any other questions that we have to pass through?  Is your fallopian tube smooth?  Yeah.  Smooth.  Do you moisturize your fallopian tube is the question?  Yes.  Yes. 
[03:37:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  Give it a book.  Congratulations, Kiki.  You just won a book.  Thanks.  Awesome.  Thanks.  Make sure you continue to moisturize your fallopian tubes.  I always do.  Good.  Don't forget you have Blu-rays, too.  Oh.  We can't just sit here and get prizes out all day.  Well, I thought you maybe just won Blu-rays.  There's a lot of fallopian tubes out there.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if people want to have smooth fallopian tubes, you can call and get whatever you want.  But I don't know how many smooth, especially not as smooth.  I've heard Kiki's are the smoothest fallopian tubes anywhere in radio.  So, I had a question for E-Rock. 
[03:38:00]  Why is he wearing orange?  Are you criticizing E-Rock's fashion, Roland?  It's Halloween.  I love the t-shirt, but if I wear orange...  Which t-shirt?  It's t-shirt.  T-shirt?  T-shirt.  T-shirt.  I got orange, too.  Michael, you're wearing a Bunny Ranch t-shirt.  You're just all class, who kid?  Who gets you in a Bunny Ranch Las Vegas t-shirt?  Yep.  All class, buddy.  All class.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  I had a question for you.  Something puzzled me today. 
[03:38:30]  Okay.  You were talking about the New York Radio Message Board.  Yeah.  And you were criticizing them and making fun of them for taking air checks.  They do...  You know how Denny comes in here sometimes, and he's got these air checks.  Dennis Falcone, of course.  He's got these air checks of old DJs.  Yeah.  And they...  And he collects them.  He talks about how great they are.  Well, E-Rock earlier today was criticizing some of the members of the New York Radio Message Board  for taking their air checks and adding the music back to it. 
[03:39:00]  An air check is just the jock talking.  And I guess back in the day, a lot of people would sit at home and record just the DJ talking.  Now, who could...  That's got to be weird to you, because I would assume that you would sit by your radio like  I did and record songs.  Yeah, we record music.  And make bootleg tapes and stuff.  There's this whole little group of radio weirdos.  Underworld.  Yeah, an underworld of people who would record the DJs.  Are you kidding me?  Like, between the songs. 
[03:39:30]  The guys talking.  And so what E-Rock stumbled upon, and what he was criticizing people for, was on the New  York Radio Message Board, they take their air checks that they recorded of these DJs and  add in the old music so they can remake the complete shows.  These guys are freaks.  And listen to them.  Now, this is what...  And you're right.  DJ Hookett.  These guys are freaks.  But what was puzzling me was, where do you draw the line, E-Rock?  Because you are a little radio nerd yourself. 
[03:40:00]  Like, you have a collection of air checks yourself, correct?  Yes.  And last week, if you remember, for Jocktober, we did a montage of all the terrible names  that Todd Pettengale has used on WPLJ when he's doing his horrible phone scams.  And it was like three minutes long.  Like, there was dozens of names on that.  And E-Rock put that together, not because he's been monitoring the station, because he  went through his old Scott and Todd air checks and his Scott and Todd CDs and put the montage 
[03:40:30]  together.  He's a radio aficionado.  And I'm not...  I can't even criticize that necessarily, because I've got my own obsessions.  Either he didn't get no head from his wife last week, you know what I'm saying?  Was that it?  No head?  So he didn't get...  Go ahead.  E-Rock got an argument with wifey.  So you just went into the vaults.  Is that what happens, E-Rock?  I guess so.  You don't get head from your wife and you end up going into the radio vaults?  I'm going to go listen to Scott and Todd.  Did your wife ever sit there and be like, E-Rock, I'd really like to blow you at some 
[03:41:00]  point today.  You've been listening to Scott and Todd for hours trying to put together this montage.  After she died, she died, she died, she died, she died, she died, she died, she died.  The Scott and Todd song.  That was Rowan's version of the Jocktober Clothes song.  E-Rock, is that what happens?  No, I was putting all that stuff together because I thought Friday was going to be the last Scott  and Todd for Jocktober.  No, I'm going to do another one.  But it was great for the show.  I'm not saying you did a bad job.  But what I am saying is at some point, doesn't your wife, does she ever say, E-Rock, my vagina's 
[03:41:30]  empty, something like that?  Oh, yeah, I'll get that.  You wait, does she?  See, that's what I'm talking about.  She tells you her vagina's empty?  Well, not in so many words.  Because I was going to say, that is a huge sort of parallel thinking.  I'll get, really, you're listening to, you just came home from radio and now you're listening  to other radio?  Yeah, but you love it.  I go through stuff.  What is, what is, what is. 
[03:42:00]  Go E, go E.  What is your hobby that annoys her the most?  Is it the toys?  Is it, because you're not, like, you like wrestling, but you don't like wrestling like  I like wrestling.  No, I'm not at the, I'm at a level, but not your level for wrestling.  But you, I have my one obsession, and that's pro wrestling.  That's creepy.  You have, oh, please, Roland, you can't even talk.  A minute ago you said t-shirt, and it sounded like teacher.  I've never heard anybody make that mistake before.  I can speak clearly, it's creepy. 
[03:42:30]  Plus, you're a grown man who wears Star Wars t-shirts to work every day.  Nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that, yo.  Nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that.  Is it, but E-Rock's got, like, a ton of obsessions.  Like, all he does is find new things to be obsessed with.  And that's why, like, I always thought the Lego thing for E-Rock was so weird, because  he picked it up as an adult.  It's not like he was obsessed with Legos from the time he was a kid.  Yeah, that was like two years ago.  Right, like two years ago.  Wow.  He's 32, 33 years old. 
[03:43:00]  And he decides, oh, I should start playing with Legos.  I find it relaxing, like a puzzle.  Okay.  In his defense, though, Legos had jump, leap to bounce, all the cool stuff he could do.  Is that right?  Planes, Indiana Jones set.  Of course.  It took him two minutes to get to the, it took him two, two items on the list to get  to Indiana Jones.  I have the Indiana Jones, a little money card thing.  Yes.  So, is it the Legos?  Is it the toys?  Is it the Simpsons? 
[03:43:30]  The real shit.  Is it Doctor Who?  Is it wrestling?  Is it radio?  What is the, those are your six, top six obsessions, I think.  Correct?  I know, I consider myself an E-Rock historian.  Besides pro wrestling, my only other obsession is Eric Nagel history.  Stargate.  And I guess a little Stargate.  That's right.  You did say the one tattoo you would get is a Stargate tattoo, correct?  Now, what is the obsession that annoys your wife the most?  Honestly, I hear about a lot of it, so I don't know if there's one that's singled out. 
[03:44:00]  She doesn't like any of them.  She just doesn't like stuff being left across the house.  Sometimes you leave your toys out?  Yeah.  And do you ever say, I'm going to play with those later, so I don't want to put them  away yet?  What the fuck?  Well, yeah, so I'll say I'm doing something with that.  You know, the dining room table's got stuff, upstairs has stuff.  But what's that?  When you say I'm doing something with that, what's that?  Well, like in the dining room table right now, I have two laptops, a stack of DVDs, and  some...  Ninja Turtles? 
[03:44:30]  No.  I'm trying to think what else is there.  Oh, some vinyl, like Kid Robot Titan toys.  What's a Titan toy?  Another vinyl line.  Oh.  Another company for Simpsons Doctor Who stuff.  Oh, and you got all your...  So, and that's what?  Because you're working on stuff on your laptop, you're going through radio air checks, but  you like to have your guys with you.  Well, they're new, so I'm looking online to see which ones I don't have.  You know when I do my work, I like to have my guys with me.  And then downstairs, there's a whole other thing going on, with tapes being converted 
[03:45:00]  into different computers, and so it's constantly something is going on.  I would imagine.  I don't think he's a weirdo, though, because I got a hard-on going through his phone with  all the, you know...  All the nerd stuff?  Yeah, the exclusive toys.  Yeah, he loves the fact that I have that.  But his name came in the back, though.  It looks like a back of Toys R Us, like, warehouse.  Right, because he's got all his toys still in the package, and they're all autographed.  I will tell you something that you might be shocked at.  I have come to the conclusion last week that I'm going to be getting rid of most of my toys. 
[03:45:30]  Whoa!  This is breaking news!  We thought on Friday, we thought Nicole announcing she was pregnant was big news.  This is bigger!  E-Rock, you're going to be giving away your toys?  Yeah, I decided to narrow my collection down.  Is it by choice or by force?  Good question, Roland.  It's by choice.  Whose choice?  Mine.  I'm running out of room, so I've decided that, you know, certain toy lines I don't really 
[03:46:00]  need to keep active anymore.  What are...  By...  You mean...  So does that...  Is that to say you're not going to buy more, or you're getting rid of?  I'm getting rid of.  What are you getting rid of?  My Masters of the Universe.  E-Man.  That seems wholly necessary.  E-Man.  E-Man.  You still think it's cool, Hukis?  Sando.  Are you still getting the hard-ons?  The new edition is coming out, though, next year.  Well, he's getting rid of his Masters of the Universe.  What do you think about the new edition, though?  Are you done?  Does that mean you're giving away...  You're getting rid of Masters of the Universe?  Well, I'm not getting rid of Castle Grayskull. 
[03:46:30]  I'm keeping that.  But the figures...  Yeah, but Eric, don't...  The older and the newer ones are all going away.  Don't you understand what's going to happen?  If you don't get rid of the Castle Grayskull, which is the play set, eventually, you're going  to sit there and go, well, I can get a couple guys just to put in the castle.  There might be a He-Man and Skeletor inside it that's just going to stay there.  Eric, you've got to get...  If you're going to get rid of the stuff, you've got to get rid of the stuff.  Fucking hoarder.  And I'm going to tell you something.  Have you told your wife you're doing this yet?  No, this is the first she's hearing of it. 
[03:47:00]  Okay, okay.  Don't say another word of it.  I don't know if she's actually listening.  If she is, then whatever.  But just do it.  And you've got to get rid of everything.  And you've got to make it dramatic.  And there's got to be a lot gone.  Because she is going to be so turned on.  She's going to think you're a new man.  And if you could do it without wearing a Simpsons t-shirt while you're doing it, that would help you.  I can't promise that.  I know.  I know.  Doctor who?  Baby steps.  But if you could...  If she comes home...  Because I'm telling you. 
[03:47:30]  When my wife comes home, and my bullshit is cleared out of the closet, or she sees a big bag,  and I say I'm giving this to Goodwill...  What?  Holy shit.  She gives you that pussy.  Of course she does, who kid?  Immediately.  It's an aphrodisiac.  And I think your wife is the same way, Eric.  When a woman marries a man-child, when she sees...  And somebody who's on the brink of being a hoarder, when she sees them throwing stuff away, 
[03:48:00]  getting rid of dumb collections, like Masters of the Universe, which I will call a dumb collection.  Transformers, which I will call a dumb collection.  When she sees that stuff going away, holy shit.  She will immediately get to a state the DJ Who Kid calls moisture.  Give me that pussy.  I'm telling you, Who Kid, if you've ever had any trouble with women, which obviously you  haven't, you get rid of a collection.  If you can't be a DJ, if you don't know famous rappers, get rid of your childish bullshit. 
[03:48:30]  Because if you do, she'll let you come in her.  She will, won't she?  You've come in many bitches, correct, Who Kid?  Yeah, but it's not about me here.  Oh, you're right.  It's not about you.  He's a hoarder.  I mean, are you aware of what this effect could have on your marriage, Eric?  This could be the greatest thing you've ever done.  It could be only...  It's only positives that I'm seeing here.  Oh, yeah.  Trust me.  Your wife is going to be wet.  When was the last time he came in here? 
[03:49:00]  When was the last time you achieved Climax inside of your wife?  That's...  That's something Who Kid wants to know.  He wants none of your bits.  Okay, okay.  All right, all right.  Maybe you're right.  That's a great counterpoint, too.  Maybe it was a personal question to just jump to right away.  According to Who Kid's Instagram, he did it like three hours ago.  Did you achieve Climax in a woman about three hours ago?  Hey, what are you going to do, right?  I'm the Black Fawn.  Now, we're getting rid of Masters of the Universe, and we have to go all the way, dude. 
[03:49:30]  You've got to get rid of your Castle Grayskull.  Look, you know what you do?  The stuff that you don't really want to give away?  Put it in a box and mail it to your parents and tell her you threw it out.  No, they're the ones that sent it up here to get her out of their house.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Then you've got to get rid of it.  You've got to...  Okay, so He-Man we're getting rid of?  Yeah.  Transformers we're getting rid of?  Transformers we're getting rid of.  E, do you have Trapjaw?  Do you have Trapjaw, Eric?  I might.  Yeah, I think I might.  What's Trapjaw?  Holy shit, keep it, motherfucker.  He's a half-human, half-robot. 
[03:50:00]  This figure has a jaw that's made out of steel that would bite through shit.  This guy's a freak.  What the fuck?  He-Man, you know what I'm saying, He-Man?  I guess I did, but I've forgotten by now.  One of Skeletor's guys.  Okay, why?  Is it a valuable thing or you just...  He's the one that connected to the black people.  Oh, I see.  So I think you should just keep it.  Because he was like the N-word in that cartoon.  He did.  He connected as a little black kid in Haiti.  He was like, Hey, man, yo.  Yo, what up, sir?  I understand.  I'll put them on my dashboard so they don't steal my car.  Giveaway?  Well, let me find out what we're getting rid of first. 
[03:50:30]  So we've got He-Man, Transformers.  What else?  Voltron.  Voltron.  Oh, hell no.  These are all collections that should be going, by the way.  I have a collection of...  This one's a little weird.  Tell me.  Hess Trucks.  You still have a Hess Truck collection?  I've had them since I was born.  Why Eric gives it away?  Maybe.  They're all in the box.  Hess Trucks?  Yeah.  Get rid of that.  That is a shit...  That's a true with Shady collection.  You know that.  It's kind of racist, too.  No, they actually...  They're worth a lot of money.  People... 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  There's a secondary market for Hess Trucks, huh?  Yeah, especially older 70s and 80s ones that are still in the box.  You still have ones from the 80s in the box?  My mom used to buy two.  One to play with and one to keep.  So your mom fed into this thing from the get-go.  Your wife must be very, very frustrated with your mother.  I don't think she knew that until now.  Well, I'm telling you.  Mrs. Nagel, if you're listening to this, it's the mom that did it to him.  So we're getting rid of the Hess Trucks, too.  What else are we getting rid of?  I gotta see. 
[03:51:30]  There's still boxes of other stuff I gotta go for.  Are we keeping Simpsons stuff?  Simpsons and Doctor Who stuff is staying.  How long have you been a fan of Doctor Who for?  2010.  So that's what I'm saying.  That was three years ago.  That's another...  You're not supposed to pick up obsessions now.  Well, when there was no...  There was nothing left of Stargate, and I needed to find something else, so...  It's so fucking weird.  But Doctor Who was out since, like, the 80s.  That's what I'm saying.  60s.  You're not even a fan of that.  60s.  Like, the old...  With the horrible effects and everything. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Like, I could be like, oh, you're a Doctor Who guy for life.  Like, that's the only saving grace I have.  Like, I haven't let go of pro wrestling.  Yeah.  But I've been there forever.  It's not like I tuned in in 2011 and said, oh, shit.  This is really fucking good right now.  He likes the high-end Doctor Who.  I like the Doctor Who where the robot was a toaster.  Because you...  Because you were a kid.  And it made sense.  At the time, you were like, yeah.  Yeah.  That little toaster's cool.  Yeah.  That shit is real. 
[03:52:30]  But when you're an adult, you're like, I'm not going to start watching this now.  That doesn't make any sense.  No, you're missing out.  Yeah?  It's great.  Do you ever wonder, like, what it is about you that you need to pick up on these new  obsessions?  I...  And I'm not...  Having an obsession...  Who am I to criticize that?  But picking up on new obsessions as an adult is the...  That's weird.  No, there's a lot of interest.  But once in a while, something hits you where all of a sudden you're just like, I need to 
[03:53:00]  know everything about this.  And buy toys and do that whole thing.  Yeah, if the toys are good.  There's a lot of shitty toys out there that you don't buy.  I don't know.  There's a lot of...  Yeah, there's a lot of toys.  Like, I love the Kid Robot line.  I buy a lot of stuff.  Not even just Simpsons and Doctor Who, but I like Kid Robot, so I buy a bunch of their  stuff.  Gangster, right?  And then Titan has a vinyl line that I buy stuff from, too.  Kid Robot's not really the shit anymore, though, is it?  Who, Kid?  It used to be cooler than it is now, right?  I guess the toys are still popular. 
[03:53:30]  Are they?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because I got a Giuliani toy.  Did you get the Giuliani toy?  Rudolph Giuliani?  Yeah, the Kid Robot.  Former mayor.  It's incredible.  Only, like, 30 with me.  Who kid's got good Kid Robot hookups?  So, well, yeah.  I mean, he used to be, like, sponsored by them or something, right?  Yeah, I mean, they were my boys.  Right.  If you're getting rid of anything, let me know.  No, Eric!  I got a Darth Vader Kid Robot hookups.  No, no, no, no, no.  What about that Shane?  The little Shane?  Oh, yeah, that was ill.  We're not talking about new collectibles.  Toy hunting.  No, we're old. 
[03:54:00]  We're out with the old.  No, in with the...  Out with the old.  I'm going to put it up for E later.  What's the...  No, don't put it up.  Eric, you can swap.  You see the people that are in your life, Eric?  I'm trying to bring you...  Are you saying they're enablers?  Yes.  They're enaglers is what they are.  Enabling the nagle.  Now.  The nagle?  What?  No, I said nagle.  That's his last name.  I thought so, too.  No, I would never say that.  That is totally uncalled for.  Here's my question. 
[03:54:30]  Hey.  Eric, what are you going to do with this stuff?  I'm going to sell it.  Why don't you...  Why don't you...  Bring all your shit in here.  No.  Yeah, we'll get the toy hunter.  And we'll get the toy hunter to come.  Who, the good guy?  Because you could...  I don't know if he's gay.  I don't think he is gay.  I don't think so.  He just loves toys.  But you think...  He's feminine, though.  Okay.  He's sweet.  He's sweet?  He's like the inside of my donut.  Okay.  Well, cronut, I think is what it is.  Why don't you bring your shit in here. 
[03:55:00]  And it is shit, I think.  And we'll have the toy hunter take a look at it.  He can take a look, but he doesn't offer, you know, top value for that stuff.  Where are you going to get top value?  Because he's got to resell it.  So where are you going to get top value from?  eBay.  Or some other collectors.  But what if someone screws you and it's worth more than what they buy you for?  Yeah, you've got to research these things.  Well, that's the toy hunter guy.  Well, you know, the toy hunter is definitely screwing.  Screwing what?  You can do your own research, too.  I don't know if that's all true.  No, but he'll tell you, this is $600, and then you go, okay, I'm going to keep it. 
[03:55:30]  Eric?  He'll say it's $600 just so, like, he'll make a deal.  The move is, I'm tired of hearing about the toy hunter's negotiation tactics.  The move here, it's not interesting to anybody.  The move here is you bring your bullshit in here.  All of it.  You see what the toy hunter will give you for it.  He'll give you a whole bunch of money up front, and you can go, you can meet your wife,  you can show her all this cash you have, you can go out and you take her to a nice dinner. 
[03:56:00]  That is the move.  And come in here.  And then, she will allow you to go back to your mansion.  Yeah.  Go upstairs.  Woo!  To the Nagel Dome.  I don't like...  The pleasure chamber.  Yeah.  She'll put on something nice and tight for you.  You like that, right?  You still have a library to do.  We've got about a minute left.  You like that when it's tight, right?  And cold.  And then, keep the A.C. on, she'll get under the covers, and she'll let you achieve climax  inside of her.  I'll bet she will, if you did that. 
[03:56:30]  If you just brought all your bullshit in here and walked away with none of it.  Uzzies.  You know what empty space in the house translates to?  Space in the vagina.  For you.  Come.  Why don't you tell me about Russell Peters?  I'll tell you about Russell Peters.  He just happens to be, Eric, one of the biggest stand-up comedians in the entire world.  Smart niggas.  He's got a brand new comedy special.  It's called Notorious, premiering exclusively on Netflix.  The hour-long special was shot on Russell's recent world tour and is the newest comedy  special for Netflix. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  If you haven't already checked it out, you really have to.  Notorious is not to be missed.  Check that shit.  Russell has been doing stand-up for over 20 years.  Since he was 19.  This guy sells out arenas all over the world, has nearly a million Facebook fans, and his  YouTube videos have over 75 million hits.  Word up.  Entertainment Weekly calls his new special Notorious funny and risque.  Netflix is also launching an exclusive four-part series, Russell Peters vs. the World.  It takes you behind the scenes during the Notorious tour, so don't miss Notorious and Russell 
[03:57:30]  Peters vs. the World, now streaming only on Netflix.  I saw both this weekend.  Were they good?  Both awesome.  Funny?  Yeah.  And Eric, I'm going to tell you this.  Like, all I do, my wife will say, hey Sam, you want to go to Toys R Us this weekend?  I'll go, no, I don't want to go to Toys R Us.  And you know what happens?  That's your problem.  You should just go without her?  No.  What happens is, blowjobs happen. 
[03:58:00]  That's right, Roland.  Because she gets so excited that, oh my gosh, for a moment, I may feel like I've married  an adult.  A man is in front of me.  This is amazing.  What does Sam get when he goes to the boot camp?  Hummers, blowjobs.  Nice.  I like that Sam is here for his cock.  Right.  I'm here for my cock.  No, his cock is his cock.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yes, Eric.  I'm here for your cock, too.  I'm here for everybody's cocks.  That's why I exist on this planet.  Isolate that.  Your cock, too, Roland?  Not Roland's cock.  We gotta go.  Roland's cock has never been in use. 
[03:58:30]  It's got dust on it.  Stay tuned.  But we'll brush it off, buddy.  I'm gonna have to bite you.  Stay tuned.  Roland and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.
