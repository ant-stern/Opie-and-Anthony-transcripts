<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with a raucous discussion about colonoscopies, fueled by Katie Couric's televised procedure. Callers share graphic and humorous accounts of their own experiences, with one caller, Tom Rokoff, making a sexually explicit claim about his relationship with Couric.  A doctor even calls in to discuss the procedure and anesthesia. The conversation then takes a sharp turn towards sex toys, specifically a sex doll, with graphic descriptions and jokes.  Jim Brewer is a guest in the studio during this segment and participates in the discussions, also sharing anecdotes about his experiences with fireworks. This portion culminates in a heated, insult-laden exchange between Rich Vos and Opie and Anthony.

The next segment features a staged brawl in the studio between Rich Vos and an unidentified individual called "Boss." The physical comedy, described with excessive profanity and hyperbole, involves broken CDs and a display of Vos's aggressive style.  The chaotic scene involves several other studio personalities including Spaz, Psycho Mark, Ben, Earl, Sam Levine, and Rick.  Following the fight, Vos becomes an "official" member of the show's "demented family." This is followed by Anthony's furious account of a three-hour wait for a car from Tel Aviv Car Service. He details his increasingly angry phone calls with operators, culminating in a confrontation with the driver and a subsequent phone call with the operations manager, Barry. Anthony uses racial slurs during this phone call. Barry apologizes, promises to suspend and later terminate the driver, and unwittingly fuels Anthony's plan to unleash a listener prank campaign targeting Tel Aviv Car Service by giving out their phone number (777-7777) on the air.  Audio clips of a prank call to a drunk Psycho Mark and outtakes from his public service announcement are played.


The show then shifts to a discussion about the frustrations of radio callers requesting songs, specifically focusing on the limited control DJs have over song selection.  Opie and Anthony challenge listeners to request Slayer on any tri-state area rock station, predicting its rejection. They dissect a WNEW weekend playlist, highlighting its predictability and the pressure on DJs to adhere to it.  A caller, Ryan from a chop shop, provides a prime example of a bad call, failing to follow show rules.  The hosts discuss behind-the-scenes manipulation of song requests on other stations, recounting anecdotes from their past experiences.

Kelly Ripa, co-host of *Live with Regis and Kelly*, joins the show as a guest, along with Jay Moore. The conversation touches on Ripa's pregnancy, her working relationship with Regis Philbin, and various humorous anecdotes, including off-color jokes about sexual acts and bodily functions.  The segment also includes numerous jokes at Regis Philbin's expense and a bizarre interaction with a caller named Walter who exhibits sexual arousal from women laughing at him.  The segment concludes with a lengthy and highly irreverent, sexually explicit, and offensive tribute to (and roast of) Mets announcers Bob Murphy and Harry Carey.

The final segment features a female caller recounting a bizarre and sexually suggestive anecdote involving large breasts, giraffe-like necks, attaching swing sets to her car, and a drunken driving incident involving a Cubs fan police officer. The conversation then jumps to nonsensical tangents including a school trip to the sun, and a helicopter decapitating Mark Grace in a manner similar to Vic Morrow's death, concluding with dark humor about Grace's severed head.  The segment ends with a break and the show's contact information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Worst of Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW  Well, what's up, Anthony?  Hey, man.  The O&A Show?  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony.  Beautiful day.  Well, we could spend a few minutes talking about Katie Couric, Anthony.  What's up with her?  She got the pipe live on the Today Show this morning.  Now, how the hell did they do that?  Oh, did anyone else check that out today?  How did they do that? 
[00:00:30]  They had her sedated.  They had her on a little exam table.  The doctor's there.  The nurse is there.  Get out of here.  And she was kind of on her side, Anthony.  Are you kidding me?  They didn't show the scope go in.  Oh, they should have shown her getting it.  But they showed the scope in her balloon knot.  Well, it was on tape, but it was on TV this morning.  And she was laying there in front of people.  She was laying there in front of people on her side.  The nurse obviously could see her balloon knot. 
[00:01:00]  The doctor's in there, you know, moving around with the scope.  And they're projecting Katie's colon on the TV screen this morning.  Oh, my God.  And then commenting how nice it is.  Nice and pink.  And the tissue's very healthy.  Yeah.  I've got to ravage that pink tissue.  Did anyone else see that this morning?  Wow.  It was unbelievable.  That's going out on a limb there for your journalistic integrity.  And they went all the way in, Anthony.  They did. 
[00:01:30]  All the way in.  And at one point, she didn't realize that the scope was inside her.  Why?  What did she do?  I don't know.  Did she get up?  I guess she was asking a question, when is this going to start, or I don't know, something.  And she, uh...  Oh, maybe the hubby was giving it to her.  Uh, do you want to...  Stretched out.  Here's the audio of Katie Kerr talking about this.  Colons, rectums, bowels.  It's not exactly the stuff of cocktail party conversation.  If you recall, not that long ago, people were hesitant and uncomfortable talking about breast cancer. 
[00:02:00]  And men rarely discussed their prostate.  Now those cancers are routinely discussed with family members and friends, and most importantly, doctors.  Okay, terrific.  Great, Katie.  You missed the video this morning, huh?  Yeah, I would have loved to have seen that.  Was she talking and everything?  Oh, yeah.  And she had this huge pipe in her back door.  Oh, yeah.  She's yapping.  She was a little goofy because she was sedated, you know.  Wow.  All right, Katie.  A little pressure, Katie.  Nothing to worry about. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah, it was some interesting TV this morning, Anthony.  Action, action, action, action, action.  Uh, Shari from Howard Beach.  Hey, I got the pipe.  They couldn't sedate me enough.  I was screaming for the whole thing.  Oh.  I don't know how she was talking on live TV this morning.  It was the worst, and I'll never have it done again.  I'll tell you how.  She's used to it.  What are you trying to say, Anthony?  I'm saying that occasionally me and Katie Kerr engage in anal intercourse. 
[00:03:00]  Wait a minute.  Tom Rokoff.  You better say allegedly, Mr. Rokoff.  Every nightly news.  No, no.  It is a known fact that I, Tom Rokoff, have given it to Katie in the back door.  Okay, allegedly.  Yeah, you better say allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Why not?  So that's why she had no problems this morning.  Obviously, if you saw the piece, you saw that the doctor had no problem insuring the implant into Katie's balloon, balloon, balloon knot. 
[00:03:30]  Balloon knot, right.  That's what I said.  And it was just because the mighty Rokoff member has stretched out that entrance to the point where anything, my God, even, well, at one point I put a hand in, and then I slipped another hand in.  And then I tried to clap, but I couldn't. 
[00:04:00]  She's so tight.  This is wrong, Mr. Rokoff.  Let's know, folks.  I've got to tell you.  Hey, Mr. Rokoff, could you say colonoscopy for us today?  Oh, of course.  Colonoscopy.  No, colonoscopy.  A hilly laurel.  Colonoscopy.  A colonoscopy.  Right.  Katie's first colonoscopy.  Yes, that bitch's back door is very ample. 
[00:04:30]  That wasn't the first pipe she's gotten.  And there was no camera attached to the mighty rod that is Tom Rourke's trouser monster.  Tom Rourke, I'm just going to see that right here, Mr. Thin, into Katie Couric's behind, and I remember.  That's one camera shot that Psycho Mark should have been in on.  The Katie Couric ass cam.  Imagine that.  You just see Psycho Mark holding up a wow sign inside her colon.  At the end of the tunnel? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, there it is.  Oh, no.  We've been wowed.  We've been wowed.  It's the Psycho Pass.  Look, he's jumping.  Mike, you're next on N.A.W.  What's up?  I went for this thing.  I didn't get no damn drugs.  No?  I got that thing shoved up there with no drugs at all.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, oh.  What?  That's called a rape.  Were you even at the doctor's office?  Let me tell you so.  I'm making a right-hand turn right now.  I'm going to that doctor, and I'm going to kick his ass. 
[00:05:30]  Nah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You really had the test without any drugs?  I swear to God.  Man.  When I went in, it's like, oh, it's a little discomfort.  No big deal.  You might feel a little pressure on the back of your head.  Oh.  Man.  In your throat.  Dude.  That thing, and I didn't see what it was.  I went into this completely stupid.  I had no idea.  There's cancer in our family, and I went for life insurance, and so I had to get this test.  Cancer in our family.  Hi, this is Uncle Cancer.  Hey, how you doing?  Cancer in our family. 
[00:06:00]  Hey, I got to ask you a question.  Sure.  Cancer in everyone's family.  What are you saying?  I hear when you get the exam, that you, I guess we could say, because we're talking medical  here, right?  Oh, sure.  What?  I hear that you ejaculate.  What?  No, I listened to that doctor.  What's her name?  Where do you?  Maybe if you're a...  A couple people emailed and said the feeling is so over the top that you have a little...  Oh, my God.  A little ejaculate come out.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:06:30]  They may live on Christopher Street.  No, I'm telling you.  A bunch of people said it was embarrassing.  No.  Can we see your stuff?  There was nothing happening there, dude.  No, okay.  It was hiding.  All right.  All right.  I thought I'd ask because a couple people emailed us on that.  Oh, the pipe.  Oh.  It was painful, man.  I was like...  And then I seen the whole thing afterwards.  I seen what it was.  That thing was like a garden hose rolled up on one of those wheels. 
[00:07:00]  You know, it was like 15 feet long.  How embarrassing.  Look.  I made a mess all over myself.  This is wonderful.  I love the pipe.  Not recommended.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Right in the back door.  Sorry, Doc.  I left a little something for you.  Fantastic.  Is that why you were floating all over the room?  You're just floating around in Mary Poppins.  Did you see that? 
[00:07:30]  You just had the pipe and you were so excited.  You had to float all over the room.  Well, I'm used to things going in there.  Did you see Mary Poppins?  Yes, I did.  Remember the umbrella she used to float on?  Yes, I did.  That's been there.  Open.  You're on a pipe, Doc.  Don't worry.  Use your hand.  I can take it all, don't you know?  I get the pipe every day. 
[00:08:00]  You can't be so careful.  There's cancer in my family.  And a pipe in my butt.  Woo-hoo.  Keep going, Doc.  You'll know you went too far when I start gagging.  No, don't you know.  Oh, boy.  I got a little retard. 
[00:08:30]  I love that voice, though, man.  You're wrecking my childhood.  Driving home, don't you know?  Mary Poppins.  You can't open that umbrella all the way, can you?  Tight, huh?  I don't know.  I don't gag.  I don't gag.  Who don't you know?  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good.  I actually had one of these done, and it's actually not the procedure that's so bad. 
[00:09:00]  It's the preparation beforehand.  They make you drink this, like, new lightly stuff.  It's like a gallon's worth of fluid, and you cannot leave your house for, like, four hours,  and you just sit there and wait until your whole body has to clean itself out.  Whoa.  So then all of a sudden, you just sit there, and you're like, you hear, like, you know,  you get the gurgles, and you get the dump sweat.  The dump sweat.  And you're just sitting there, and all of a sudden, you're like, whoa, I got to go.  And you run into the bathroom, and it's like watching Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's driving on to the toilet seat, and you hear, it's just doing number one at your butt.  It's like a floor out.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:10:00]  I love that.  Well, Anthony, it's coming in for the instant feedback.  Tony from Jersey, opiates true, you do ejaculate.  Oh, stop.  Fred from Jersey, when you press on the prostate, seminal fluid may be released during the pipe.  Yeah, but that's not true.  Well, there's a doctor on the line.  Let's ask him.  Hey, Mike, what's going on? 
[00:10:30]  Hey, how are you?  Are you a doctor?  Yes.  Wow, we have doctors listening to our show, Anthony.  And what are you a doctor of?  Uh, well, I'm an anesthesiologist.  Not like Dr. William H. Cosby, Jr.  No, no, no.  He's a fake doctor.  I couldn't see that.  You're going to get the pipe now.  Slow down.  You just came to my apartment for some advice about acting, and I'm going to give you the pipe,  because I'm Dr. William H. Cosby, Jr.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now let me put your hands on my pants. 
[00:11:00]  Look here.  So you numb ass?  Uh, no.  You said you're an anesthesiologist.  Anesthesiologist provides sedation.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  So you numb the ass.  Wow.  No, no.  They don't numb it.  They just give you, you know, all of the nice stuff in order to tolerate the procedure.  You sure you don't numb ass?  My job, I'm the ass nummer.  I numb ass for a living.  No, you give them some stuff to calm them down, right?  Yeah, well, you see, the problem is, in the past, insurance companies would reimburse an 
[00:11:30]  anesthesiologist to give, you know, a good dose of medication.  Yes.  But now they're no longer paying for anesthesiologists.  Mm-hmm.  So that's why some of these doctors are just not really giving anything any longer and just  trying to do it.  Trying to do it without the numbing?  Well, I'll try to do it without sedation.  Oh, I don't care.  Don't even use the camera.  Just put your head in there and look around yourself.  Don't you know?  Yeah, so basically tell the listeners that, you know, if they're going to have one of these 
[00:12:00]  procedures, that they should tell them that they want an anesthesiologist and, you  know, talk to their insurance company.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right, bye.  Take care.  All right.  Oh, man.  Take a look around.  How's it looking?  Yes, I know there's a few friction burns in the first few inches.  Like a missile silo.  This is like an abandoned missile silo. 
[00:12:30]  No, you know.  Pulpino away.  Oh, brother.  Amy, you're next on WNEW.  Hi.  Hi, Amy.  What's up?  I work for a hospital in Manhattan, and we take care of a lot of patients that have  colonoscopies.  Okay.  And the thing that people aren't admitting to is during the procedure, they put a lot  of air so that they can visualize the insulin. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  And afterwards, you have a little fan going on behind the door.  So you're going to let all that air out?  Yeah.  Why didn't Katie Couric show that part of the procedure this morning?  And here's me in the recovery room.  We have to encourage the patients to, you know, let it all go.  And so the poor patient next to them that had a cataract is, you know, having a heart attack  next door. 
[00:13:30]  Katie Couric, NBC News.  Wait, Ann, I believe we have a clip of Katie Couric.  You might hear something in the background.  I believe she was in the recovery room when she said this.  Colons, rectums, not exactly the stuff of cocktail party conversation.  Not that long ago, people were hesitant and uncomfortable talking about this.  That's how we flew with Mary Poppins. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Don't you know what?  I'm flying!  I'm flying!  Mary Poppins!  I'm flying!  Don't you know?  Jimmy, you're next on N.E.W.  How you doing, O.N.A.? 
[00:14:30]  Good.  You had one of these pipes there, huh?  Yes, yes.  But the worst part about it is...  Oh, no.  When you walk in, the first person you see is the old hag nurse.  Yeah.  Then you go into the room and see two gorgeous nurses.  Yeah.  There comes Vaseline up this long tube and ready to stick it up your butt.  Yeah.  That is the worst part of it.  How embarrassing.  Can't they make this cooler somehow?  No.  There's got to be something they could do to make it really hip to get the pipe. 
[00:15:00]  And the best part of it...  I don't know why, but I'm just saying, it's like this guy is saying.  Who would want to go do this procedure after doing this?  Set the place up like a disco!  And the best part of it, they ask if you want to watch it on the camera.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, no.  Put me right to sleep.  Wake me up when it's all over.  Yeah.  You know?  And the hot nurses are checking out your cranky ass and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, this is embarrassing, but hey, you got to have it done.  Yeah.  We all know that. 
[00:15:30]  That's the truth.  Lee, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  What's up?  First off, the Ed Wynn and the Coz are just so dead on, it's not even funny.  Oh, man.  I'm like peeing my pants in the car here.  I really hope not.  Well, he's helping us out with our pipe discussion today.  I love the thunder!  Don't you know?  It's wonderful!  The pipe!  Mary Poppins!  I'm flying!  I'm flying, Mary Poppins!  I'm flying, Mary Poppins!  It is.  Right there.  I've got to pull over for a second.  I've got to tell you this story about the cigar and variety I had in the doctor's office. 
[00:16:00]  Lee?  Well, first of all, he looked like Jay Morrison.  That didn't help the situation.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  It really was.  Was Jay Marco there assisting?  Well, first of all, in order to do this thing, they have to give you an enema to clean  you out first.  Okay, terrific.  So they decided to give you another one.  And that didn't take, because there was no way my butt was going to un-putcher.  Right.  You know, like everybody else said, you know, they grease up the pole and start peeling  around, and zoop, they're in, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[00:16:30]  It sounded like somebody was pulling your stomach inside out.  It was horrible, man.  No anesthesia, no nothing.  Right?  But that's not even the best part.  They get all done, and I'm about 40 minutes from home.  And, you know, my wife, during the course of the day, said, hey, on your way home, stop  to pick up ice cream, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, right.  I come about halfway home, and all of a sudden, they're here.  Oh, you start percolating?  Oh, geez, yeah.  So, I was about 20 minutes from home, and I just go in a running red light.  I, like, zip around the horseshoe turn.  I just keep driving at the same time as my wife.  And I open the door, and I move my leg, and all hell broke loose. 
[00:17:00]  All over the car, all over the driveway, so I had to throw everything I was wearing out.  Oh, you cracked yourself.  Oh, man.  That old Milwaukee moment.  You had the dump sweats.  Oh, yeah.  Horrible Milwaukee moment.  Oh, man.  I'm telling you, there was, like, undigested food from, like, when I was three up there.  Yeah.  Unreal.  Thank you, Lee.  Great experience.  Thank you for having me shared.  All right.  I feel so much better now.  You're not going to hear this on the Today Show with Katie Couric. 
[00:17:30]  This is what really happens when you get the pipe.  Yeah.  Let's see that part of it, Katie.  I can't believe she was just laying there on the side.  Oh, yeah.  And what was it, like, they lifted up the little robe and...  You could see the doctor, you know, working it.  Making it.  Working it like you're trying to get, like, a toy at the fair.  You know what I mean?  He's working the pipe like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's working it, you know.  Like one of those machines where you've got to pick up the little stuff down the hole  and drop them in the hole.  Yeah, yeah.  He's working it, looking at the TV screen, like, all right, Katie, I'm in. 
[00:18:00]  Look, we're going around the corner here.  Oh, man.  Pointing out stuff.  Because all of a sudden, she's like, oh, what's that brown spot?  Oh, no, when we get closer, you'll see that.  It's perfectly fine.  It's just crap, Katie.  Oh, man.  Making a new video game?  All right, just a couple more and we'll move on.  Please.  I think Edwin is getting tired.  He doesn't want to talk about this anymore.  I love the book.  I'm actually going to go and get it, don't you know?  Ron, what's up?  Hey, my wife went. 
[00:18:30]  Nervous as could be about going, right?  The whole ordeal the night before, taking all the stuff.  The doctor, Mr. Studley, this tall guy, she's all impressed by the way she looks.  She's embarrassed as could be.  She gets there.  They give her all that medication, makes her nice and nice.  She doesn't know what's going on.  She's feeling good about everything.  When she's all done, I'm out in the waiting room.  The doctor comes out with a smirk on his face and the two nurses are giggling.  She got all done.  She goes, that wasn't so bad.  If you want, you can do it again.  Wow, she liked it.  She liked it. 
[00:19:00]  She liked it.  You should have said, Doc, I'll take care of the second exam.  Thank you very much.  I said the same thing.  Thank you.  And they denied me also.  So I went home and did it myself.  I didn't have one of those little wands they used.  So I just used my camcorder.  I have one of those old ones from the 80s.  Oh, from the 80s?  Where the whole VHS tape fits in.  I was going to say from the 19th century.  But one of the old ones that had to hook up to the VCR.  Oh, all right.  So that whole thing had to go. 
[00:19:30]  When was the last time you had one of these pipe exams?  What time is it?  I'm having one now.  Well, there you go.  There's our discussion on the pipe.  That's called snoodling.  Snoodling?  What do you mean snoodling?  Oh, it's done with another man, Jim Italia.  Yeah.  Snoodling though, Joe.  Snoodling while I get the pipes.  Please.  Snowball me.  Come on.  Bring it on.  I'm flying, Mary Potter. 
[00:20:00]  T-bag me, you whore.  Don't you know.  I love it.  I'm going to the village tonight.  Oh, yeah?  Getting the pipes.  Oh, you are, huh?  Yeah.  That's a mine shaft.  Not even a doctor's office.  Small after-hours club.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Don't you know.  Oh, man. 
[00:20:30]  I want to thank you for stopping by today, sir.  You're very welcome.  Yeah.  Could you please give me a Cleveland steamer?  No.  I'm a little hungry.  Could you use a hot lunch?  Don't you know.  No, that's okay.  How about the rusty trombone?  No, no, no.  I love it.  No, that's all right.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Dobby and Anthony.  What do you know?  1027 WNEW.  Alright, it's JFF Talk, the 1027 copy channel to our Sophie and Anthony in the studio today. 
[00:21:00]  Our pal Jim Brewer.  Who used to be on Saturday Night Live.  How do we get fired?  Fired?  I don't get it.  I have to say that.  I have to say that to my pal Jim Brewer, man. 
[00:21:30]  I don't think that guy's ever got through a spit without bubbling around.  Yeah, we're going to laugh at the other day.  It was like the third word in, got all effed up.  But God, man.  We play the Tim Meadows game.  See how long it takes for him to flub.  Three words.  Tim's left not saying a word.  All of a sudden, he's drinking his little hot cocoa.  Boy, you're a hole for me, though.  I don't know.  I was just crazy, obviously.  I didn't like...  Appreciate it. 
[00:22:00]  Somewhere.  If you were drunk right now, you'd appreciate it.  Oh, man, if I was drunk, I'd have my pants off, trying to talk Yankee Doodle.  Come on, let's go, Blackboard, man.  Get on all board.  Which fast?  Not me.  You hunky-dunky.  Jim, I got a present for you.  Yeah, let me see this.  This is for you.  Oh, this is great.  Look at that.  Wow.  Yeah, that's top of the line.  I got to be honest.  I always wanted to... 
[00:22:30]  Try it?  Not try it, but see it in person.  Yeah.  For those of you at home, it's a cake.  Could be.  Where did you get this from?  An actual...  Wow, it's got one of these, too.  Authentic Greek features, they call it.  No, no, I know.  Every guy does that.  He jams his fingers in every hole in the thing.  And he goes, hey, did anyone use this, man?  You're like a little late for asking.  Oh, my God, he's mounting it.  It comes with a bottle of Ducks all-purpose lube. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a...  Yeah, it's a badge, man.  Yeah, it's a fake rubber one.  Wow, look at the way it comes.  Did you see that HBO?  How they make these things?  Yes.  Yeah.  Real sex?  Yes.  Yeah, the Chinese women putting the little hairs in one at a time?  Yeah, and it's like five, six grand.  You get a whole doll.  Yeah.  And the one guy ordered, and he had a menage a trois.  Yeah, with his real chick.  With his real chick and a doll.  And a doll. 
[00:23:30]  What are you...  I saw that.  What's wrong with you, man?  Like he's feeling up the doll, and his real chick is right there.  I feel like, wait.  Let's try something new.  Try a finger and a butt out or something.  I mean, if you think that...  It's pumping rubber.  Yeah, and he's got a real girl right there.  I saw that one.  Interesting.  It has a disclaimer in the box.  Do not attempt to warm this product in a microwave or conventional oven.  Conventional oven. 
[00:24:00]  Let me see the cover for it.  Slide it in the oven.  Yeah, it looks just like it.  Wow.  It was molded off.  You found her in a truck trunk.  You found her in a dumpster.  The resemblance is outstanding.  Now, if we can't afford that, we have just the bunnies.  I don't see what's funny.  We worked very hard for this.  I haven't seen you really dig in yet.  Yeah, give it a try.  Give it a diddle.  Well, we want to know what you say.  It hasn't been used, we swear.  It was pretty good. 
[00:24:30]  Isn't that pretty fun?  Yeah.  Come on, you dirty bird.  You want to play?  You want to play?  Let's get it up.  What are you, crazy?  What are you, crazy?  Oh, my God.  Laying the left hand into that rubber snatch.  No, it's nice, though.  She is a real blonde.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  It is interesting.  Did you see the gas light?  Let's see.  Wow.  Very interesting.  Look at that thing, the gas light.  Where's it?  It's the flesh light.  The flesh light.  Oh, my God.  Feel that.  What if it happened to just pillows?  You know when you just get medieval?  It does.  When you're like, the chick is gone for a little while.  You haven't done it while.  You've been arguing for like, I am sick and tired of cleaning up after you.  It's a jacket. 
[00:25:30]  I walk in.  I'll hang it off when I want to hang it off.  What's the big deal?  Why can't you just walk in and put it in the closet?  Because it's my house.  All right.  God.  As soon as they leave, you just take a pillow, fold the corners together.  Yeah.  You make all the other pillows and watch.  That's right.  Good night.  And then you have some beers, come back and do the fat pillow. 
[00:26:00]  Do we need to be this inventive?  I like to say, it looks like a big thermos.  You know, you go, why is Bill screwing his coffee?  It does.  The flight side looks like a thermos.  No, I'm good.  You take some cream with the coffee with?  Yeah.  You unscrew the top of this big thermos.  It's inside of the rubber vagina.  It does.  Yeah.  Could you imagine that in the lunch box?  This is like the next jerk piece.  All right.  What's going on?  All right.  What's going on? 
[00:26:30]  Put it down.  We got something for you right here, pal.  My doggy's got a vagina.  Drop the vagina.  Drop it.  This one's got, like, little dirty.  Yes, it certainly is.  I got my dirty sex in the hot chocolate.  That's what I kind of love it.  Ah!  You did it again!  The way you punch those things is a little scary, then.  Let me see that one.  It is dirty.  It's got some issues.  It's dirty, man.  Ew. 
[00:27:00]  God, what did it fall on the floor?  It smells normally like vanilla and coconut.  Mmm.  It smells like, um, potpourri on a nice Sunday afternoon.  Pre-measure disposable.  Yes.  I'm looking for a joke.  Let me get my vanilla.  I can't find how you clean with it.  All right.  You know what you can use this for?  Like practice pitching.  He's just against the backstop. 
[00:27:30]  Bing, bing, bing, bing.  What?  I agree.  Throw some help.  Hey, Rick.  You should...  Rick, show them the candy, too.  You want to get candy, too?  Oh, you got a whole bunch of...  Oh.  You went to Graham Vanilla.  Do you know our own Rick, the producer, was sitting there last year just munching away  on a big chocolate penis.  And without even a care. 
[00:28:00]  He's just...  And we look at him and go, do you understand?  Do you know what you're eating?  And he's like, it's chocolate.  Yeah, but it's a big chocolate penis.  Brewer was all excited about the candy, and then he realized what it was.  He was like, oh, man.  He's just like, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.  Going to town.  The whole time, I was eyeing the chocolate pretzel.  Uh-oh.  It's a pretzel stick, and I'm going, oh, man.  I'm going to tear that up.  No, that's just the Irish one.  That's a nice two of this, and I went...  Oh, man.  That's not a pretzel.  That's a...  No, it isn't a pretzel.  I don't know what that is. 
[00:28:30]  It's a pretzel.  Yeah.  Sure it is.  It's the dirty pretzel.  Tell yourself...  ...slay the truth in old days.  This is an outrage.  This is ridiculous, and I don't care for it.  New friends, I don't appreciate them.  Boy, my, it's just good fun.  All right.  Oh, man.  What do you think about the chocolate penis?  Well, the pretzel's good.  I'm not sure she likes it. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  He's sexually assaulting the rubber badge with the chocolate pretzel penis.  It's like a clam smoking a cigar.  Oh, my God.  He's totally sexually assaulting the rubber woman part.  Look at that, man.  This would be great, lost and found. 
[00:29:30]  Anyone leave me this year?  I found this on the desk.  Anyone with the rubber vagina?  Better yet.  All right, I'm going to keep it here.  Better yet, bring that in for show and tell.  I found this in my dad's closet, along with some crazy videos.  Yeah, man, tell you, I got a little kid, teacher, talk to your kids when they're like six or seven about sex.  I'm telling you, because...  Because I know the two of you, including myself, you know the way you learn. 
[00:30:00]  You know how you learn on the street, right?  You know what I learned from Dermot Egan?  And he had like three older brothers.  Right in.  Egan, you know, Irish Catholic, not going to crap out each other on a Sunday afternoon.  Dermot Egan, get out of your clothes, Dermot Egan!  Dermot Egan, you know, I'm like this. 
[00:30:30]  I was 82 in kindergarten.  And I swear to God, I was 82 in kindergarten.  Wow, that is jobs.  I'll never forget this, because there was a kid on a bike, and he was around, I don't know, second, third grade.  He was riding, he was looking at me.  And he went, yo, man, how much you weigh?  He was like, how much you weigh?  Tell me, no, I'm not going to tell anyone.  Tell me how much you weigh.  When Egan came, I was like, holy shit, he's riding on his bike.  He's wearing 32, Fat Lewis. 
[00:31:00]  So anyway, Dermot Egan told me that my brother Vincent, you see him, it was always drooling.  Always dude, he was a retard on the block and I was drooling.  He did.  I'm sick and tired of me.  Shut up.  Dermot, shut up.  So anyway, Dermot goes, my brother Vincent, he told me, he told me what, how people have babies.  He said, hi, if you stick your pee-pee in her, then you pee in it. 
[00:31:30]  And that's how I learned about, I'm like seven years old, running after a little girl.  It's like, if you don't stop on peeing, you give me a baby.  Yeah, like in first, I guess it was first grade, I used to think you had to grab a woman and do it in the back door to get her pregnant.  What?  And you needed a rubber to get a girl pregnant because that had the stuff on it that went in.  First grade, people.  I didn't even hear of a rubber until I was like.  Really?

He's going to follow me if he wants to come on.  Oh, man.  That would be cool.  Tell him don't be swayed by what he heard yesterday with Kamal because we like Johnny.  Yeah, we're trying to get the other guy from the Jerky Boys on today.  Then maybe we could have Kamal call in and then make a fight live on our show.  Maybe we could invite them in for Fight Club.  That could be cool.  See who could beat the crap out of one another. 
[01:33:00]  Now, how many fights have we had in the studio?  I can't even count.  These are all real fights, too.  The only one that hasn't fought yet is Ben.  Has Earl fought?  Earl hasn't fought either.  No, I don't think it's the Earl fight.  Everyone else has fought.  Rick has fought twice.  Three times.  Psycho Mark, you fought and you got your ass kicked.  Shut up.  My bag.  Oh, I don't live with a gay guy, pal.  So why?  I don't live with a gay guy. 
[01:33:30]  He could be Chinese.  What's the difference?  Gay.  Not only do you live with a gay guy, you come home from work and he's lounged on your bed  watching TV.  Want to explain that one to our listeners?  Yeah, he's getting warmed up so I can use his ass as a missile ramp.  No, please explain.  Oh, God.  All right, Psycho Mark, do you want to get into this?  No, I don't want to get into it.  Explain.  Explain, I live with a gay guy.  All right, explain this one.  Okay.  You live with a gay guy.  Yeah.  All right.  So?  Explain why when you come home from work, he is lounged out on your bed watching your TV. 
[01:34:00]  He's not lounged out on my bed.  Is he on your bed?  No, he's not.  Oh, now you're going to change the story.  He has his own TV.  But only as of a month ago.  See, now it's...  You're such a liar.  See?  Oh, man.  Don't fart into the microphones, man.  Dick.  Look at him change the story.  How many times have you told us in the back office that you come home and your gay roommate  is lounged out on your bed watching your TV?  Ow.  Charles Nelson Riley. 
[01:34:30]  Ow.  Not only is he lounged out, he's watching Lifetime Network.  Well, that's the woman's network.  Usually crying watching something.  He cries the party of five.  So do I.  Yeah, that's pretty normal.  Jennifer Love here with a can to know you'll never touch him.  He cries the party of five.  That's cute.  That's nice.  That's nice.  Yeah, okay, great.  Yeah.  And I'm the fag.  Okay, that's good.  All right.  Thank you.  Instead of the psycho mark, it's floor foam mark. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, thanks, Rick.  Ben will bury you.  Come here, Ben.  Here, Rick.  Oh, wait a minute.  Rick, Rick, get...  Don't even go there.  Rick, Rick, Rick.  Rick, get in the middle of these things.  Okay, Ben, how many times you wanted to start this?  I'm fine.  You know what?  I don't care.  Okay.  Go right ahead.  Open the door.  Ben, how many times has...  Ben, you realize now...  What?  You're going to lay this on the table.  Well, it's nothing you haven't said before.  I don't know that.  Yeah, that's all we're trying to get to.  Ben, how many times has he told us in the back office that he comes home from work and his 
[01:35:30]  gay roommate is on his bed watching the Lifetime channel?  A million times, but he stopped because he finally got his own TV.  Mark finally bought his own TV recently.  But I've gone over there and he's been in his little tight little shorts.  I went with Earl one time in his little tight little shirt with his shirt on.  And Earl was horrified.  Wait till I leave after like 10 minutes.  But the view from your apartment is great, huh?  Very man-ass.  That's what he tells us when we're all out to dinner. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, man, I live with a gay guy, but you've got to see the view.  It's worth it.  The upside-down hot air balloon.  Okay.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  When I'm leaning out the window and he's pressed up against me, I can see that.  Oh, Jesus.  You sure Marco's not your roommate?  Come on, tell us.  Marco's not.  Okay.  Marco is definitely not my roommate.  Marco.  All right.  I live with a gay guy in that set.  You know, this is America.  It's okay.  This is America.  It's all right. 
[01:36:30]  If I live with a lesbian, it'd be a totally different story, right?  But I don't think you should be running around the studio saying I'm gay and everyone else is gay.  I mean...  Well, you are gay.  Don't you think I should know?  Shut up, Mark.  I live with one.  Oh, geez.  You got the gaydar, too, huh?  Gaydar?  Yeah, yeah.  Goes off.  Gaydar detector.  People are twisted, man.  Chuck, what's going on?  Psycho, Mark, man.  I mean, I respect what you do, you know, as far as getting the wow signs up, but you cannot 
[01:37:00]  honestly tell me that you do not have at least a little bit of fag in you to be able to live  and go home every day with someone where there's a fag laying on your bed?  I mean, to even take a s*** on the same toilet...  Ah.  Sorry about that, guys.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Even to take a crap on the same toilet with a...  Hello?  Yeah, I'm listening to you.  Hold on a second.  Even to take a cup on the same toilet, the fag has to be presented to you got some fag in you. 
[01:37:30]  I have my own bathroom.  I take craps in my own bathroom.  I mean...  My head badass does not...  Don't hear.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  Here.  on his yellow Miata. Nice try, fag boy, but you live with a guy. Of course I've seen his bed. I  goddamn love with a guy. Can someone get me a shovel so I can bury myself some more? Into who? 
[01:38:00]  Of course I've seen his bed. I live with a guy. Even better is his little statues. Describe the  statues around us. So the naked men like this. You got naked man statues in your apartment?  Really? He's got both? The statues. How big are they? They're statues. Like full-size statues?  They're huge. They're really nice. Of naked men? Like this. Like on one foot, standing on 
[01:38:30]  one foot with a leg bent and their arms straight out? Is there like water coming out of them?  If you saw somebody's statues, you would die. You would die. I swear to God. Can you take  some pictures just for the show? Obviously we wouldn't be able to put it on the website,  but I got to see these statues. Of a statue? Yeah. He's got this statue of a guy leaning  over a cliff with his arm and his hand and his legs out. It's naked. But the view's great  from your apartment. That's what he's been telling us for months. He tells us all these 
[01:39:00]  stories at dinner and we're like, oh yeah, it's great. And he goes, yeah, but the view's  great, man. I got one of the best views in all of New York, in all of Manhattan. It  always comes with a price. Very expensive. And you know what? I also remember, he's always  inviting us up there. He's always inviting guys to come up and check out my view. Keith,  what's going on? Now, I got a question about Psycho Mark's gay roommate. Yeah. How do they  know? How does he know when he's at work, Psycho Mark's at work, that this guy's not sticking 
[01:39:30]  his toothbrush or forks or combs or anything up his butt? Toothbrushes? I'll see none of  that. Because I sniff it when I come home. There you go. If I live with a gay roommate,  everything will be disposable. Toothbrush. Everything. Close. All right. Thank you, Keith.  Bye. You think he's like trying on your clothes and stuff when you're not there? Because he  doesn't work, right? I did notice some of my pants are a little washed out. He doesn't  work. He doesn't do anything. He goes to the gym in Chelsea twice a day. He's independently 
[01:40:00]  wealthy. Did he cut the pockets out of your jeans for you? Hey, what's up? Hey, ONA, what's  up? Not much. I live with a gay guy, and it is absolutely hell. Why is it hell? Well,  first of all, he's like the biggest male slut. He has gay guys. All right. Wait, let's back  up. Okay. You say living with the gay guys, absolutely hell. Okay. Why would you live with  him then? All right. Well, I was living with my best friend in high school. He went off 
[01:40:30]  and moved to California with his fiancee. What was his name? The fiancee. It was Maura. It  was a girl. So you were stuck for a place? Yeah, I was stuck for a place, and he was a friend  of a friend of mine. So I was desperate. I moved in, and it absolutely sucks. All right.  Why is it such a problem? Well, first of all, he's got, like, gay guys prancing around all  the time. Prancing. They prance. I'm not trying to be, you know, double standard. It's like, 
[01:41:00]  you know, if it was a girl. I mean, they're like guys there constantly. Yeah. I mean, I...  Do they flirt with you when you're there? No. I hide in my room when you're nuts. No,  the worst part is, though, and this might sound gross, but, like, if he has to go to the bathroom,  like, you've got to get out of the bathroom immediately. He cannot hold it in.  Ugh. Well, those muscles are probably a little stretched out.  Oh, God. Come on. Yeah. This is real, man.  Does Richard Simmons come over to your place, uh, Psycho Mark? 
[01:41:30]  Every day. As a matter of fact, he gives me the rescue trombone.  No!  John, what's going on?  Damn, I live, like, across the street from one. I can imagine living with one.  Damn.  You're crazy, man.  All right, John.  Yeah, any porn that you don't like, just hook me down with it, man.  Come on, it's all right.  Yeah, I think giving porno to a 12-year-old might get us in trouble. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not 12. I'm 13.  Oh, well, then it's fine. It makes a big difference there.  Look for the big box of porno from Opie and Anthony in the mail.  All right, John. All right.  Thank you. All right, later.  There goes our buddy, John, who's going to get us in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  Pete, you're next on N.E.W.  Opie!  Anthony, everyone, what's up?  I almost was going to...  Well, I didn't almost, but I checked out an apartment, like, uh, like a month ago.  I had a feeling the guy was gay.  And, uh...  How did you have this feeling?  Well, the voice on the phone. 
[01:42:30]  And so I went...  I visited the place.  And I was...  And you know how hard it is to see an apartment in Manhattan.  So, I mean, I...  At this point, I was just reaching.  So, I went to visit the place.  I was reaching for...  Yeah.  ...for the apartment on him.  So, I was...  Basically, I went in to see the place.  And I was...  I was good the whole time until he showed me his bedroom.  He felt the need to show me the whole place.  And then I looked at the bed, and I started thinking,  What goes on there?  You know?  Am I comfortable with this? 
[01:43:00]  That's a gay Disneyland.  Yes.  The bed.  I have to get the hell out of there.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't do it.  Butt pirates of the Caribbean.  So, Mark, I feel for you, man.  Mark has no problem with that.  Uh...  Mark, how could you not have a problem with that?  Because he doesn't bring guys home.  Uh...  Why?  Wait, Ben's taking it, Ben.  What's the guy from Venezuela?  I've never been there.  Mark, Mark, the thing is, though, he...  He's a gay man.  He has those thoughts in his head.  Like, he looks at you...  He's a gay guy and has slanted eyes. 
[01:43:30]  No, but he looks at you...  He looks at you, and he sees possibilities.  Great.  Good.  I can...  And how high and drunk you get, man.  I'm telling you.  Mike, you won't drink away, my friend.  You probably...  You probably have already been violated and have no idea, man.  What do I have here in the hoods for the last week?  What you thought were hemorrhoids.  All right, Pete.  Mark, just make sure you...  Make sure you wipe the toilet bowl, because you don't want to catch the gay.  You're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:44:00]  102.7 WNEW.  Helmet!  Helmet  Helmet  I'll give you ten bucks if you know the name of the song, Anthony  Helmet  You used to play it all the time 
[01:44:30]  Is it I'm Just a Girl?  Unsung  Don't speak  Unsung from Helmet  Better than much  We're all in a very, very good mood today for the first time in a very, very long time  I'm in a much better mood than I was last night  I wish it was Friday so I could dedicate an FU Friday to a company  We have a couple of brand new enemies of the show today 
[01:45:00]  One of which we'll get into later  No, no, no, don't even say what I'm saying  Okay  Because then people will have to sit by and patiently wait for the other enemy of the show  It's a good one, though  A radio war  My God, I had the worst time last night when I left the show  As you know, Opie, my truck was in the shop yesterday getting brakes  Right? 
[01:45:30]  I could have rented you the cabrio  Yeah, that'll be the day  I'd rather stand out on 57th Street for ten hours  Like you did?  Like I did  No, so, you know, my truck was effed up  I needed brakes  So, uh, I took a car service in yesterday  I called a good car service in Brooklyn  And they drove me to Manhattan  We did the show, had a great time yesterday  I think we had a banner show yesterday  I think we had a fine show yesterday  Uh, I go to leave  Everyone else left  In a good mood  As was I 
[01:46:00]  I call up a car service to take me back to Brooklyn  Wait, wait, were you on dope?  Why?  Everyone left yesterday wanting to strangle someone  Yeah, I know  Okay  I'm embellishing a little bit on the story  There was much hatred in the back office  But now everything is fine  Everything's fine  Moving forward  Yeah  So you left the, uh, the, uh, the confines of the office  Yes, left the building  Went, uh, first I went to the phone and I called another car service  I gotta get back to Brooklyn  So what do I call?  Who do I call?  You gotta call a number that's easy to remember

[01:57:00]  I do listen to you  On the way into work  Every day  When were you alerted  To this situation  About  I would say 840  Probably on his second call back  Because I was  I told the woman  That I was talking to  To please give somebody  Of some authority there  The message that tomorrow  You guys are just going to  Get the best god damn commercial  You've ever had  That's when I probably  Got a load of  Well I do want to thank you  For mentioning our phone number  Oh no  You know what happened  When we mentioned the number  If I give the word 
[01:57:30]  Your drivers  Your drivers will be sent  To many locations  To pick up ghosts  Because our listeners  Will call these cars  777-7777  And without even me saying so  Without me even making a hint  To the fact that they should  Send a car to somewhere  That people aren't  They will do it anyway  Because our listeners  Are a bunch of  Son of a bitches  Just like Opie and Anthony  Well we might have got one  Last night from you already  So  No that would 
[01:58:00]  That was me  And I was there  What  The driver was a ghost  The driver is  You know what  I can't say  I want his head  I want his head  He shouldn't be driving  The guy should be  He shouldn't be driving  In this city  He's incompetent  And inept  Gone  You know what  That's to say the least  With this driver  He is the worst  Why do you have him  On the payroll  Well you understand  They're independent contractors  Now let me explain 
[01:58:30]  How our system works  You call us  We send them  The call  Over a paging system  Yeah  Like over a beeper system  He sees it's going to Brooklyn  Yeah  Going to Brooklyn  Is like  You know  It's going to cost him  Two hours  Cost me money  I'm just telling you  What went down  I'm not trying to make  Any excuses  Cost me money  Exactly  You know something  I don't like to  I don't like to stereotype  Or anything  And of course  This driver's name  Hasn't been given out  But what is his 
[01:59:00]  Ethnic background  If you would please  I assume  It's Pakistan  Pakistan  There you go  I hate  The effing Pakistanis  They are the most  Obnoxious race of people  On the face of the earth  And the Indians  Ought to nuke them  While they got the chance  Well  Pakistani  Pack your ass  With dynamite  Okay  Freaking Pakistani  Piece of crap  Can't even drive  A god damn car  In Manhattan  It's a grid  It's a grid 
[01:59:30]  57th  Between 7th and Broadway  Look at a map  There it is  Oh my god  You can't get lost  In this city  The only thing  I could say  Is he saw on his tager  Where it was going  Yeah  And he said  Oh my god  How am I going to  How am I going to  Deal with going to Brooklyn  Just got to understand  If they go to Brooklyn  95% of them  The times  They come back empty  Tel Aviv  And if they go to Queens  We do a lot of airport service  Tel Aviv limo  So they come back to someone  From the airport  Tel Aviv 
[02:00:00]  Which is absolutely no excuse  Tel Aviv  I thought the guy  Was coming from Tel Aviv  Well  I was waiting  I'm going to fall there quicker  If he was coming from Tel Aviv  He probably would have been  A better driver  Why the Pakistani  Working for Tel Aviv  Well we're multi-national  Multi-national  Multi-moronical  You'll hire the handicapped  I see  The mentally handicapped  Human  I just hope  Nobody else is listening  To this at work  Why? 
[02:00:30]  Because I know  I'll go  I'll go in tonight  And I'll get my head handed  Let me tell you something  Sir  You have done a good job  In talking this out  You've explained to me  What happened  And that the guy  Is a complete  Friggin' moron  I swear  I am not happy  With suspension  I want termination  I want termination  Of this Pakistani  Termination goes beyond  My responsibilities at work  And the question I have  Yeah  Are you going to let  Set the listeners loose  Absolutely 
[02:01:00]  People let her rip  777-7777  Order cars  Don't be there  Just like the car  Wasn't there when I was  At least  At least it'll be  It'll keep the operators busy  It sure will  There you go people  Let her rip  I want that guy's green card  Oh yeah  Pakistani  How'd he get in this country?  Probably just saving up money  For bombs  Well  You have to discuss that  With our president  You know  How he got into this country 
[02:01:30]  But seriously  About the free ride  Yeah  I will give you one  In fact if you  A little late  I own a truck  I didn't have a truck  Last night  And I needed the car  You're going to eventually  One day need a car  Tel Aviv was not there for me  No I'll call Vital Limo  Okay  My friends at Top Notch Limo  I will call them  Okay  But Tel Aviv  Is off  Of my list  I'm throwing it out  Of the Rolodex  It's a hard number  To forget  But I'm going to try  To forget it  And our listeners  Please remember it  777 
[02:02:00]  777  Just send cars  Everywhere people  I want  I want Tel Aviv limos  Driving around  Like a god damn  Video game  In this city  Like Mad Men  Like Pac-Man  Like Road Race  Like what  Yeah  Like some kind of  Wacky  Pac-Man game  What is it  Twisted Metal  Yeah  Twisted Metal  Just running over  Each other  In their Pakistani  Guts flying all over  The hot damn road  Alright sir  Thank you  Okay I'm sorry  Listen  All joking  If you ever really need us

[02:03:00]  I couldn't even talk  And I swear  I was like  Tears of frustration  Ready to run down  I was  I was Mr. Pussy  Ready to cry  Out of 57  I can picture you crying  We're in my car  We're in my car  Sporky Anthony  Waiting for his  Tel Aviv car  That ain't showing up  Let it rip people  Have fun with it  Enemy of the show  Let's take a break Anthony  Yes  Stay there  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony 
[02:03:30]  107-WNEW  Your days of finger banging  Old Mary Gaines  Run and cross  Through her pretty pink pennies  Are over  Be quiet sir  Yes  Yes  And it's time  For the Opie and Anthony  Show  Oh dear  212-757-1027  Let's go to Ryan  On line one  Ryan  Yes  You're up on  WNEW  Let's go 
[02:04:00]  Ryan now  Let's go  Yeah hello  Yeah go  Hey Opie and Anthony  Hey what's up  How you guys doing  You guys rock  Great  We just wasted 15 seconds  That's what people  Want to hear in their car  Let it rip  Yeah I was  I work in a chop shop  On the island  Alright  Oh you're down  No 401 anyway  Turn that  Turn that god damn radio down  I hung up on you pal  Too many mistakes  In one call  We have very simple rules  Turn down your radio 
[02:04:30]  If you're on hold  That means you're  Going to be on the radio  Very very soon  That could possibly be  Every blunder  A phone caller can make  That's a prime example  Of what not to do  When you call this program  As soon as we say  Hi WNEW  Boom get into it  There you go  Start talking about  What you wanted to talk about  Don't ask how we're doing  How you doing  I'm up  I'm on  What  You ask us how we're doing  And then it said awkward  We're doing fine  Stupid  You know  Hey open it  You guys suck  Listen I work for a chop shop 
[02:05:00]  Boom get right into it  Yeah but oh  Did you ever call a radio show  When you weren't in radio  No  Never  No  I did  I think people like  It's kind of scary  I think people that call  Radio stations are  Losers  Kind of scary  No I'm just kidding  Now no one's going to call  You're terrible  That was called a joke  Yeah  I'm sorry  No I think it's cool  To call like talk shows  Yeah  But to call a music station  And request a song  Those people are losers 
[02:05:30]  Yeah  Yeah  You can't request  We've been through that before  Your song doesn't get on  Your song does not  Get on the air  Do the math  Before we did  Before we started doing  This talk show  You know  Ant and I  You know  We did  We were on a music station  For three years together  Before that  I did many years by myself  On rock stations  Right  And people would call in  Night after night after night  Requesting songs  That would never get on the radio  Yeah  The DJ does not have the power  To put your song on the radio 
[02:06:00]  Figure it out  No they pay  A guy called  A program director  A lot of money  To decide what you should hear  And there's a strict list  That DJs have been fired  For going off the list  Fired  Here I'll put a challenge out there  To every single rock station  In the tri-state area  Okay  Guys call up and request Slayer  Slayer  Call up and request Slayer  I guarantee there's not one station  That will play your song  It's not going to happen  You can request it over and over again  For the next year  It ain't going to get on the radio 
[02:06:30]  Why do you think you hear the same songs  Over and over again  Every day  Because they're written on a list  That the DJ is given  And they must play those songs  That is it  What is that  The weekend list  For any W  See even here on the weekend  You would think they would let the DJs  Just go crazy  And do what they want  No there's a list  Let's see  What is this for  Alright  Sunday  I believe this is the 12 o'clock hour  Okay 
[02:07:00]  Jimmy's Shelter  Sure  Of course the Stones  Rat  Lay it down  Lay it down  Zeppelin  Dancing Days  Guns and Roses  You Could Be Mine  And ACDC  Hell's Bells  Wow  There's a bunch of songs  I've never heard before  There you go  Isn't that great  God  Whoever is like  Playing the music on the weekends  For WNEW  You're not going to get fired  We got a wall filled with CDs  Play what you want  I don't know  We have no ratings on the weekends 
[02:07:30]  Take a chance  I don't know  Take a chance  People don't want to take those chances  And you know what it is  Like the people that  Who programs the music  Jeremy  Does Jeremy program the music  Jeremy admitted to me  He's not even trying  He's just  He's just  Kicking a few songs out of the air  And putting them on a list  And making the jocks play them  Yeah  If I was like the guy  Working on the weekends here  At WNEW  Listen  You're not a talk show guy  And we're not going back to music  Anytime soon  Take a chance  What's the worst  That's going to happen to you 
[02:08:00]  You'll probably get fired  Get some deep cuts on the air  During the weekend  Because I've noticed this  About management  You know  Program directors  And what not  For how much  They can't yell at us  Oh  Yeah  You know how that is  But how much  The bosses can't yell at us  And want to  They take it out  On other people  Around the station  I've seen it happen  It's pretty sad  Like we'll do something  That almost gets  The whole staff fired  Yeah  And they got to like  Okay guys  Maybe we ought to do  The post  Maybe you went a little too far 
[02:08:30]  This way  We'll do it this way  But like  And I  Are like the  The kid in the  Twilight Zone movie  Yeah  That's how they treat  Anthony  Right  Coincidentally is Anthony  Oh you're going to stay  For dinner  Because Anthony wants you  To stay for dinner  That's how  You sit right next to Anthony  That's how they  They treat us around here  Yeah but  But on the other hand now  You get a jock  That  Puts  Doesn't  Put in the weekend  Music sweeper  Between Jimmy Shelter  And lay it down  And  What are you doing 
[02:09:00]  Don't you know  That you're supposed  To put a music sweeper  In between  And they get like  Yelled at  Music sweepers  So it's not that easy  That almost  Ratings up  There was a point  Where Opie and I  Were in that situation  And you were in that  Situation before I came  On board  Where  You did take the chances  And you got your ass  Reamed for it  I took a lot of chances  When I was by myself  And you got  What was I going to do  Play the moody blues  Over and over again  This morning  What is that  A music sweeper  Remember the jock meeting 
[02:09:30]  The jock meeting  To use that  Alright  Whatever  Yeah  That was always fun  We're talking about  Current day stuff  Yeah  So I mean  Guys  If you're playing the music  On the weekends  Just go for it  Come on  You really think  Jeremy's listening  To this station  On the weekends  And he's going to know  That you played  Something other than  Zeppelin  Let me let  All the weekend jocks  In on something  Yeah  The bosses that  Can and will fire you  They don't even listen  To the station 
[02:10:00]  On the weekends  They're not even  In the same state  Right  They go home  On Friday  Go crazy  Go crazy  You know  As a matter of fact  Just do your own  Talk show  Like Jeremy's  Going to pull it  Out of effect  Doesn't matter  Jeremy  Goes home to Washington  Every single weekend  He leaves Friday  Before our show starts  Right  Ken  He's too busy  Running three or four  Other radio stations  In this company  He's nowhere near  New York  On the weekends  No one knows  What goes on here  On the weekends  Take a chance  Go for it  You get in trouble 
[02:10:30]  Say Opie and Anthony  Told me to do this  Yeah  If you play something  Really cool and obscure  Then you can play  The powered by Opie and Anthony  Sweeper  Before you play it  Right  But don't play one of those  Right before a rat  Tune or something  Right  There you go  A little education  For the guys playing  But if you're a  You're a listener  And you're calling up  Your music station  Requesting a song  Just don't  Don't embarrass yourself  They don't play  Your request  No  When you hear like  Z100 and someone 
[02:11:00]  Requesting a Britney Spears  Tune  The reason they're  Putting that call  On the air  Is because they were  Going to play  Britney Spears anyway  Right  Then they make  Believe  Oh wow  I can't believe  You're calling for that  Yeah we can get  That on for you  This is even better  Wait give me the  Britney Spears  This is even better  I love when  I love when stations  Do this  They're like  Crushkin  Where the song  Is already playing  Right right  But I thought  They were requesting it  Like how did that happen  How did that happen  They knew what song  The caller wanted  Like you hear  The music start  Hi 
[02:11:30]  Z100  Yes  What do you want  To hear this  After this  Could you play  Some Britney Spears  For me  Ah you got it  What's your favorite  Radio station  Z100  Yeah I like  Traskin  And it's all taped  So you can't even  Like pull a fast one  On them  But they got  Z100  Yes  Could you play  Some  Cool  Play some cool  For me  Go ahead  You're playing  Britney right now 
[02:12:00]  Aren't you  No you got to  Request Eminem  Because that's  The next song  Coming up here  On Z100  That's another  Thing they do  If you're  Calling with a  Request  And they're  Not going to  Play it  And they're  Going to play  Eminem  Or something  They'll say  Hey could you  Just say  Request Eminem  And I'll confess  When I was  Working at like  B.A.B.  On Long Island  Yeah  I had a lot  Of requests  On the radio  At night  Opie  It's the  Nighttime attitude  On B.A.B.  It's the  All request  And dedication  Hour  They would call up  They would call up  And request like  Slayer or Fish  Like cool bands  Right  And also I'm like 
[02:12:30]  Oh dude man  I have no power  Here I can't  Play that stuff  But listen man  I'm going to be  Playing in the city  By the Eagles  Can you request  That for me  All right  On my cue  Hi B.A.B.

[02:24:00]  And he'll bust my chops  He'll bust anybody's chops  But he like  He loves her  I don't think  I don't think  There's a person  On this earth  That he doesn't like  Yeah he seems like  He loves everybody  He really does  He really really does  I heard he wanted  His money back  On a rich boss show  In Staten Island  This guy's not funny  I don't get the jokes  Gentlemen explain it to me  I am so excited  To be with you tomorrow  I am too  I can't wait  I love when  When you come in

Because my wife's totally on to us 
[02:28:30]  Is she?  What does she suspect?  Well you know  She just knows that there's that special chemistry  My husband's favorite show was the day you co-hosted  The day we co-hosted together  It was so much fun  Yeah he thought it was awesome  She's fine with it  You know when you get married  Everyone's allowed like they're one person  Exactly  So my wife's  I go  You know  What if I just go down swinging with a Kelly Ripa  She goes  Ah you know  I couldn't fight you on that one  She said  Sure why not  She's like a beach ball  What do I have to see her?  The green bang can't be attainable Jay 
[02:29:00]  It's not someone you work with  I'm starting to think that Jay has already kissed Kelly Ripa's kid  Oh god  Oh my god  What?  He'll be  I hope you would lead people to believe that Jay has kissed your child already  Oh no not yet  But Wolf I'll let you know after tomorrow's show  There's always tomorrow  Who are the guests Kelly?  What's that?  Who do you got on tomorrow's show?  Oh tomorrow we have a white class  Yes  We have um 
[02:29:30]  Oh god there goes my brain  He's black  He's black you know Kelly  I know that  I don't know  Hey you gotta tell Gellman to leave you alone  You're doing  You're doing fine  Gellman's great  Why does he bother me?  He is so uptight  He might be a good producer behind the scenes  But he is so uptight  Gellman you keep her in line while I'm awake  I don't want to destroy you in the show with that Jay Moore  He's a good man  Listen if it wasn't for Jay  Who do you think books you?  It's Gellman  Really?  Yeah man  It's Gellman 
[02:30:00]  Gellman in six  He talks about Jay all the time  Kelly  I think he likes him  He just seems uptight on the show  I'm sure he's a good guy  And he's a good producer  He's really cool  He is  Yeah he is  He is round tight  I would say he's high strung by nature  But he certainly runs a smooth ship over there  He is so not high strung  Kelly  But does he know how to have fun?  Yeah  It seems like he doesn't ever have fun  Oh my god he has so much fun  I think that he's portrayed  And I think he is the most different person than his 
[02:30:30]  First of all  What did you say?  He's a good producer I'm saying  No  No his whole personality doesn't come across on the show at all  Oh  You know like he's really fun  And he's not tight  He's really laid back  Who else is on the show?  Huh?  Who's on Friday's show?  Uh Friday's show  I don't know we have a  Is Y-Clip doing all six segments for two days?  No  Yeah who else?  Kelly  That's called promotion  There's four million people listening  Who else?  We have Billy Gilman on Friday

I just couldn't stand her  You're not parading those kids out there are you?  No  I mean that I  I mean that I  That destroyed  Ariel and Mrs. Hector  That destroyed that show  Do you guys have kids?  No  Are you going to have kids someday?  Yeah but I'm not going to like parade them around on the radio over and over again  We prefer dating them at this space of our lives  No I'm just saying that you have to  I mean that you'll say like when you have kids you have to talk about them 
[02:32:00]  Hell yeah but that  It's a part of your life  You had to get nauseous with Kathy Lee doing that all the time though  Well I mean I don't I don't know that she did it all the time  I physically vomited the day she started doing the egg song  Where she's singing about how Cody and and Giff sat there eating an egg  And she writes a goddamn song about it  Wrote a song about it like to sing it before your head go  That made you vomit?  I swear I  It made you vomit?  I physically got sick  I just couldn't take it 
[02:32:30]  It had nothing to do with this hangover at all  Exactly  Might have been the Jager monster  Might have been the Terry Nyquil  Are you a drinking gal when you're not pregnant?  Yeah I mean I like to go out once in a while and have a few  What's your poison?  She looks like a party girl  I like margaritas  My husband's Mexican so I'm a margarita drinker  Nice and what background are you with Kelly?  My father's Italian my mother's Irish and Italian  I see the Irish in you  Yeah most people see the Irish in me

No you live in Manhattan  I got a place in the city now so I can come 
[02:33:30]  What?  Sounds good  What?  Everybody moans like that was a bad thing  We're all just behaving  Yeah because you should always follow up that word with something else  Oh so you can come so I can come around  Right  Right  We're in such a state of arrested development it's ridiculous here  Trust me  It is it's a bit like junior high over there  Kelly we're on our good behavior today we're all biting our lips  Oh good I appreciate it  I respect because I know you're my girl 
[02:34:00]  That's right  Listen I'm telling you I'm just telling you that you know you have to have me on the show  when I'm no longer pregnant  Yeah  I feel like I got to watch my mouth when I'm pregnant  Can you come by and we'll do margaritas and stuff?  Absolutely  Nice  I would love that  We're going to hold you to it  Listen you don't need to hold me to it  Okay  What if you don't have the job anymore?  Oh she's going to stay there  But it's okay  What if one of those college girls move right in?  You know what you're not the first person that said that  I like you to roll down sis bull box  Jeff Probst was on today and he's like you know those college girls are going to replace you 
[02:34:30]  You know you haven't had this job that long  I was like thanks Jeff Probst  I'm filling in for the day  I'm writing jokes that the host of Survivor thought of?  Yeah exactly  No  Kelly I'm not going to be in today I'm going to a mixer with a girl from Penn State  That's okay as long as Jay can come  That's right  On the show  On the show  Right  As long as Jay can come to the show  I'd say we hire people to like detain Regis  You could do that  It'd be like the king of comedy 
[02:35:00]  We'll have like Sandra Bernhardt and De Niro  We'll be gagged and bound  Jerry  You  You Jerry  Yo  Yo  Yo  I'm sure Regis would be grateful for the break  Ripa where in Jersey are you from?  Where  Originally?  No  January 6th  No  But I live in a different area now  But originally I'm from South Jersey near Philly  Hey we got the cycle laugh guy on the phone  Hey Kelly do you have a good laugh?  Who me?  Yeah  Do I have a good laugh? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah can you laugh on cue?  Yeah I guess  Alright hold on a sec  Hey Kelly you know what  This is so wrong but  We have to try this  Hold on  Okay  Walter  Hey guys  Walter gets off when girls laugh at him  Oh you're kidding  Yeah he likes being laughed at  No actually I'm not  You're not kidding  Yeah by the way Kelly he's a mental patient  I get that  And girls laugh at him and he gets excited  Do you want me to laugh at you?  Yeah 
[02:36:00]  Okay you ready?  You're a good actress sure  Kelly you're the best  Yeah  What kind of laugh do you like though?  I mean like I've got to know  Do you want like a psychotic laugh?  I don't think he got along with his mother laugh  Kelly it's a degrading laugh  Yeah  Like you're laughing at him  Okay you ready?  Yeah he's very picky with his laugh  Okay you ready?  Walter are you ready?  Yep  Okay  How's that? 
[02:36:30]  Wow  That was good  That's unbelievable  That's like Walter took down his jeans and you saw an acorn  As you did that he murdered a hooker with a spade shovel  Don't say such things like that  That's horrible  Walter  Yeah  Was that good for you?  Oh yes it was  Walter anything I can do to help  Don't say that you're lying now  All right  I did sound a lot like Jay's wife's laugh 
[02:37:00]  That's my wife  Wow  Was that your wife's laugh?  Yeah  That was a good laugh  This guy's getting off on your wife's laugh Jay  Let's do Kelly and then my wife and then we'll go back and we'll go back to the Battle Royale  This guy will shoot all over his jail cell  You know you should mix him up his haze  Yeah  There's people laughing at him  Hey  Hey come on  Get some girls on the wall 
[02:37:30]  We just gave you a celebrity laugh Walter  Yeah  Oh yeah I know that  There's people on the wall now  You ungrateful prick  Give him one more  Does jail cell look like a scene from Turner and Hooch  Maybe you can have some of the college girls come on  All right Walter we're going to let you go all right?  All right  Bye bye Walter  Bye  Wow Kelly's so sexy man  There goes Walter  She's talking to mental patients I'm getting a little  Kelly you rock  Is that man okay?  No  He really didn't murder a prostitute did he?  No man 
[02:38:00]  I'm pretty effing far from okay  That wasn't his one phone call was it?  He just wasted with me laughing at him?  They get a lot of guys from prison to call the show  I'm sure  I don't doubt it  Kelly laugh at me  Laugh at me  Do you want me to laugh at you?  I'm sorry  I want you to laugh at Regis  Oh I will  But somehow when I laugh at Regis  It doesn't really have the same effect on him as it had on Walter  Did you let Jay touch your pregnant belly?  Sure yeah he did  He did?  Yeah  Did I have a nice touch? 
[02:38:30]  I think you touched my belly button too didn't you?  Oh really?  Don't I have a nice touch?  You do  Like a man but I knew to touch your socks  Like a man but gentle  That's right  But you knew those were some man hands on you  Yeah  You knew that you had on that  You had that velvet dress on  You had that red velvet dress on with the belly button sticking out  And when I rubbed it I was very gentle  But you knew the right circumstances those were going to turn into some man hands  Ripa and you knew it  That's right I knew it  I know you knew it  That's why all the fish stopped swimming too 
[02:39:00]  That's why we're so hot together  Yeah that'd be great  You guys gotta watch the chemistry these two have tomorrow  Yeah it's really good  Let's open the show by slow dancing to Al Green and then we tongue kiss  We could try that  I don't think my husband would dig it though Jay  That's funny that's how I want to do it with the college girl  You might  I want to kick the show up the same way  It'd be great to see Jay getting chased around the stage by a Mexican with an axe  That wouldn't be a long chase buddy  Alright we should let Kelly go  Alright Kelly 
[02:39:30]  You guys have been great  I can't wait to see you tomorrow  If we did that you could just tell your husband  It's ratings  You know I had to help the guy out  It's ratings  The ratings go down with the guest host  So we had to do something special  I will tell him that then  In that case I'll tell him  I'll run it by him  You know what Ripa  What's that  You're the hottest  You're the hottest  I know you are  You're the hottest  Okay  I'm going to come visit you guys when I'm not pregnant  I can tell you're such a party girl  That's a lot  She's so hot you have no idea

[02:42:30]  In left center field  Look if you're way out there  Then you would have a play on it  Right  He was so close to the ball  Because of the amount of real estate he covered  I didn't think he got it  Bob Murphy should have a cup of prostate cancer thrown on him  Oh god damn  Easy  Easy man  He's not making the Mets fans happy  My blood pressure right now is nine over five  Here's a pop up  Cedeno  Gone  There's a scroll rolling grounder

[02:44:30]  But a lot of it's Bob Murphy and a lot of it's Harry Carey  Is there a way I can just make it an audio tape like in the studio here?  Oh that'll rock  Harry Carey going  He was obviously like in mid-chug  It had to be  If you sip it you can get back on track  He must have been like  I'm going to put this beer down  Before anybody realizes I'm tricked  There's a shot  First is grace 
[02:45:00]  It's out  The ball like rolls to the  The ball literally rolls to the wall  At Wrigley  Into the brick wall  He goes  There's a shot  Gone  There's grace  Safe  Oh  Because grace is out of the hurt  Round first  Grace  Safe  Oh  Hideki  Ar-Arabu  Aruba  I think the proper pronunciation area is 
[02:45:30]  Arabu  Well whatever the name  George Steinbrenner  Has an excellent opportunity  To fatten up his Japanese picture's record  On tape  I want to hear that  Sully what's going on  What's up fellas  Hey  You ever hear him  Pop up the lone cookies on the air  Oh yeah  He'll go off mic  And you'll hear like a coughing in the back  What the hell is that  Then you'll hear the  You know like someone runs with a bucket  Hell I'm still drinking that 
[02:46:00]  With the scorched head  Five  Five  Hey Bob  Hey  Hey  How about I buy you fly  How are the lungs Bob  The exercise will get some blood  There's a home run by Hundley  The exercise will help you  I love exercise 
[02:46:30]  A lot of fluid  Backed up in my lungs  My epiglottis is like a pool skimmer flap  Well the exercise will loosen up all the flam  And all the flam  The benches are cleared  I just did an epiglottis joke Norton  I know but I was more ashamed of myself  That I broke from Harry Carrier  To little Nicky  Hey how about I buy you fly  Affect him 
[02:47:00]  Melissa what's going on  Melissa  Hello  Hi  What do you have to add to this mess  Alright the way Bob Murphy says Colorado Rockies  Colorado Rockies  Yeah  It's terrible  Colorado Rockies  It's like mouth full of flam  And also Alfonso is like Alfonso  He is with like extra L in there somewhere  Alfonso  Exactly  He's from the Dominican Republic  And where's number nine 
[02:47:30]  Nine backwards is in  The Mets would like to get back in this  Back in this ball game  Galarraga  Bob Murphy  Galarraga  Why does the coach have his clothes off  You know Bob  Regular Dunez is bad 
[02:48:00]  Has certainly come around for the match  But they're losing games  Maybe you'd rather have the guy  Not hit a lick  And just let the big  I can't do a little Nicky  Let the big guys  Knock the ball right out of the park  Little Nicky down there  Steve Trasheal  Mike Hampton looks like a gay curious chiller 
[02:48:30]  Joe what's up  Hey guys  Oh yes  That is brutal  Yeah  Joe what's on your mind  Hey guys  I'm just wondering if maybe there's a  Beyond the Glory in the works for Bob Murphy and Harry Carey  Oh yeah  Thanks for getting us back on track  Good day  Stinky rules guys  Alright  That was stinky from the other studio  Yeah  Stinky's the best out  All the ladies loving the Bob Murphy and the Harry Carey 
[02:49:00]  A man who once drank eight beers in a single inning  A man who could have five steaks and two bottles of wine  A man who could drink crystal meth and liquid acid and dilaudid  Rehibinol  Every drug under the sun  NyQuil  Robitussin  And still get on the mic  Night after night  After night  With slem in his lungs  This is Bob Murphy  Beyond the Glory  Harry Carey was a man that didn't recognize his own sons 
[02:49:30]  Fans loved him  And then tragedy  I remember one time I was in a bar in St. Petersburg  During  It was either the playoffs or spring training  And I remember  I found a prostitute  It was Bob Murphy  Bob, do you remember that gal?  I remember her  We tag teamed her 
[02:50:00]  It was kind of nice  We put her on the rotisserie  And played pinochle on her back  That's what I wanted to talk about  That's what I wanted to talk about  I'm not done with that  Bob had the front end, if you will  Someone just put a wet vac down my windpipe  We'll get to it  I had the back end  And realized halfway through  That  Well, it was  It was a home run by Mark Grace 
[02:50:30]  I realized halfway through  That she had a penis  Harry Carey definitely sporting the high hard one that night  You're not lying, Bob Murphy  One thing  I always said  Bob, look at this kid over here  Look at the prize on the girl's face  When I hacked the luge on her back  And she thought I was finished  She spun around and I gave it to her 
[02:51:00]  Both barrels  You're watching Beyond the Glory  Bob Murphy and Harry Carey  Ever notice when you sit out in the sun a long time  Your head gets pink  You would think that your hair would act as some kind of buffer to the sun  But it doesn't happen  Dave Stewart just knocked out Frank Robinson 
[02:51:30]  There's a 1-0  What is a fax machine  And why is it so magical  Ever drive with your left hand and realize  Hey, hey  Hey, I've been driving with my left hand for a long time  And you switch for absolutely no reason  I've never been hit in the face with a baseball 
[02:52:00]  But I'm sure Kevin Sykes is going to feel some pain after the last pitch  I remember that night with that hose bag  She had four balls on her  And she wasn't walking anywhere  Hey  How about when we made her walk to the vending machine  Because we wanted her to do that trick with the Clark Park  Nothing better than double penetration  I can't believe you ate the whole thing  That's the worst, everybody 
[02:52:30]  Arabo  Rico Brodner is going to bat for Bobby Bonilla  Vanilla is spelled by his Bonilla nonetheless  Holy Jesus  Bobby Bonilla just shoved Jeremy Bonilla right in the kisser  You know, I have a Rockaway bed  And my friends are all on stack or two 
[02:53:00]  But you don't mix it with beer  So it doesn't really work with me  Hideki Arabo just pulled his pants down  And relieved himself  I'm a man  When I drink the stack or two  It goes right through me  Bob  The color in your face is draining  It's the pneumonia  Mneumonia  Maybe we should take him to go see my father  That's not a bad idea, little Nicky  Anymore liquid in my lungs  I'm going to need gills 
[02:53:30]  Oh, I have them?  Oh, I don't  I thought you guys were going to go to heaven  Because of all the good things you did  After the story with the hooker in the Clark Bar  I kind of have no choice  Send us where you will, little man  Just root, root, root for the car  You're watching Little Nicky, Harry Carey, and Bob Murphy  Beyond the Glory  Speaking of glory, remember that glory hole 
[02:54:00]  You were in front of with your three quarter pants, Harry  I remember it like it was yesterday  I didn't know they were three quarter pants, Bob  I thought they just didn't fit  Here I am, walking around all night  Thinking I'm a horse's ass  Because my clothes don't fit  Home plates on fire  Turns out, I'm wearing three quarter pants  Ladies and gentlemen 
[02:54:30]  Now receiving and performing oral sex  Anyone with three quarter pants  Weineger, Butch Weineger  Butch Weineger is gay  That's Dave Winfield  Long, strong black arms, stroking  Speaking of long black arms 
[02:55:00]  Barry Bonds holds that bat like it weighs about one ounce  That's it  Erin, what's going on?  Hey, the funniest thing is when they just ran out of things to say during the game  And they just start making fun of people  I like vaginas  When they were playing in Montreal last week  And they just started wailing on how nobody ever comes to the games  And how there's so many empty seats  That's what they got to do 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, I wonder why  It's somebody to say  Help me out  No, look  I can't understand why there's not more people here  You know, I saw more people out of the glory hole  Last night to pitch high and wide for ball two  I don't understand these match bombs  Here's a team  That just last year pushed the Yankees to the brink of elimination  In game two of the World Series  And they get a Japanese guy 
[02:56:00]  To replace Mike Hampton  Shooji  They had Masato Yoshi  I guess you're only allowed one Japanese man per team in the National League  And we know that the Seattle Mariners are chock full of Japanese players  Suzuki, Suzuki, Suzuki  Eat, eat, eat your lunch 
[02:56:30]  Eat your  He'll be rookie of the year probably  Eat, eat, eat, eat your  H  Way inside  The Gutierrez  Wow  Hey, Bob  Here he is, Harry  When did he take you off of that bag?  Well, my colostomy bag is quite full of the time  Full of my own feces 
[02:57:00]  Which I will throw at you right now  Oh, I can?  If I could make a request, sir  Could you throw it on me?  I'm the devil's son  That movie is one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen  Really?  I love Little Me  I gotta check it out  I laughed  So I was in a hotel room watching it  I didn't know, like, there was no one there  Yeah  From Georgia Tech  So I threw the stationery  The hotel stationery across the room  Because I didn't know how to react  I was like a black person in the front row of the Apollo  I was laughing so hard 
[02:57:30]  I was just picking up furniture and throwing it  Those windows do not break  If you were like a black person  You would have picked up luggage and jumped on us  That was not Jay Moore  That was Jim Norton  Yeah  Jim Norton, comedy teller  Niger Inner  Nice to meet you there  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, man  I cannot believe how funny that is  I almost asked myself in the car, man  I'm sitting here  I almost got in four accidents  Thanks  See you later, boys  Think you suck  Thanks for the plug  There's nothing like a young guy 
[02:58:00]  Driving in his car  Taking a dump in his car  Because no one else on Marona has any idea  I do it all the time  Right  But see, I sit next to you  And I know it  But when you're in your car  No one knows it  Hi, this is Bob Murphy for Dependent Undergarments  I'm wearing them right now  Well, I'm not  Oh, hell, I just crapped myself  No, you're not, Bob  You're not wearing them at all  It's all over the console 
[02:58:30]  I forgot to change my diney  I had a Boys Life magazine  I think little Nicky stole it from me  I don't know if I'm doing Harry Carrey  Or Martin Short doing somebody else  It's been real spitting  Hey  Hopefully I notice you wear headphones  While you do your radio program  What are the headphones about?  What are you listening to? 
[02:59:00]  What's the big secret?  Here's the guy  And there's radio for a living  And he's listening to something else in the headphones  What's in the headphones open?  We all want to know  Grace Rounds  There's a shift  Open  Rundown  Bob Murphy, what's in your headphones?  Nothing right now  I'm just going to drink some beer  And do some skin proppers  That is how it turns out 
[02:59:30]  Something like a little heroin before the game  You know, it's a little heroin, Bob  I remember one time when I was in the Navy  Ball game's over  We'll see you tomorrow night  I went to an Indian reservation once  With my wife, Helene  And they had CP's  And everything Indian you could imagine  There was a man on the field  Being pummeled by Ricky Gutierrez  You know, the TP has a hole in the top 
[03:00:00]  So the smoke can escape  Bob, I know you like to smoke  Paul Maltz  So you'd be welcome in my TP  He's unconscious  You'd be welcome in my TP anytime  I'm not a big fan of the Indians  There goes General Custer  Walking away from the battle  Oh wait, no, he's dead  Sorry, he's dead  My favorite athlete is sarsaparilla  And you don't get a good sarsaparilla too much these days 
[03:00:30]  Except for when we go south like places  Like Atlanta and Philadelphia  South Philly  Alan Iverson plays in Philadelphia  And they have a Liberty Bell  What I want to know is  Hey, I once met a man named Hitler  How many people know Hitler only had one ball on him?  I knew that  We were in double earth requirement together 
[03:01:00]  Way back when I was announcing for the cardinal  Got fired because I stuck my pen in company  And slept with the owner's daughter  But I  You know  When you put on that uniform of the red birds  There's something primal that comes over you  Cubbies are harmless  But when you're a cardinal  Shutting your stuff in the press box  And you're not 150 years old  And you actually get a r***  You feel proud to put on the red bird 
[03:01:30]  I get the same feeling looking at National Geographic  That's not Murphy sitting tomorrow  For a left  Nothing better than a Negro woman  With big long breasts  And a neck like a giraffe  I like when their nipples look like swing sets  And why are the plates in the left?  I want to put a swing set on the roof of my car  Coming back from Sears  And the kid wanted one, you know 
[03:02:00]  And all that thing blew right off  And I got pulled over drunk as a skunk  But fortunately  The police officer was  What do you know?  Hey, he was a Cubs fan  He let me go and help me put the swing sets back together  Did you know when you have a swing set  Hit by the pitch  His sights are again  Second time in the ball game  He's been hit in the face  When you put a swing set in the ground  Bob, you have to cement it 
[03:02:30]  Otherwise your children will fly right off the air  Cement the swing set or it makes the ke-klump sound  I make the ke-klump sound when I breathe  My entire ramble cut in half by one second trillion  Bob, you're killing me, man  You're killing me  Hey, you know  I once went to the sun on a school trip  It was very warm 
[03:03:00]  My mother made me wear linen suits  And we don't know how wrinkly they get in that heat  And there's no humidity on the sun whatsoever  A helicopter just crashed right into Mark Grace  Decapitating him  A la Vic Morrow  The sun is a ball of gas  You can't stand on the sun  I tried  Luckily I was wearing sunscreen  There's Grace's head 
[03:03:30]  They're going to put it in the bowling bag  And I guess give it to some lucky fan  We got to take a break  They were on fire  Nice  Fire  We'll be back  212-757-1027  Opie and Anthony  1027 WNEW </pre>
